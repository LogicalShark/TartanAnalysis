Students held on $1 million bond for break-in
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
Two Carnegie Mellon students 
were arrested early yesterday 
morning as they tried to break 
into Heinz Field hours before a 
Steelers game at the stadium.
Police arrested Sudeep Paul, 
a senior in business administra
tion and economics, and Anand 
Shankar Durvasula, a junior in
economics and social and deci
sion sciences, for attempting to 
scale a fence at the stadiums 
Gate 5 about 2 a.m. yesterday 
morning.
The two are now being held 
on $1 million straight bond each 
after being arraigned in front of 
District Magistrate Gene Riccardi 
last night.
Heinz Field security officers 
told Pittsburghs KDKA-TV news 
that they saw the men on surveil
lance tape opening an unsecured 
door.
After the two walked around 
the stadium with a folding 
chair, security officers appre
hended them as they returned to 
Gate 5. Durvasula was standing 
on the chair, trying to climb the 
fence.
When apprehended, the pair 
said they were students who had 
tickets to Sunday's Steelers game 
against the Denver Broncos and
wanted to check out their seats.
They later said they were 
filming a music video and wanted 
to shoot the last scene on the 
field.
Because of a recent threat to 
NFL stadiums, Pittsburgh police 
took the break-in seriously.
At a press conference yester
day, Pittsburgh Police Chief Nate 
Harper said police called in the 
Joint Terrorism Task Force, made 
up of the city, county, and state
police, the county sheriff, and 
the FBI. Bomb-sniffing dogs also 
searched the stadium and found 
no explosives.
Police then searched the sil
ver Lexus SUV the students were 
driving. They found a video cam
era and tripod before towing the 
car.
According to KDKA-TV news, 
a police affidavit later noted two 
different dogs responded posi
tively for hits of explosives inside
the SUV.
Harper said there was no evi
dence the pair had been drink
ing, and police found no signs of 
alcohol in the car.
Police also searched both stu
dents on-campus residences in 
Morewood Gardens and Doherty 
Apartments.
Friends of the two have not

MBA student John Centenos 
mid-semester break was not 
much of a break.
He applied his analytical think
ing skills, decision-making abili
ties, and his knowledge of trad
ing and allocating capital to win
$6000 in a poker tournament.
Centeno, a second-year MBA 
and economics student in the 
Tepper School of Business, and 
his roommate Brian Cole com
peted in a Texas hold em tour
nament along with 81 students 
from other top colleges and uni

Cole is also an MBA student in the 
Tepper School.
The event was hosted by 
Susquehanna International 
Group (SIG), a leading trading 
and financial services firm, at the 
companys headquarters in Bala 
Cynwyd, Pa.
The event was a way to recruit 
top talent, explained SIG assis
tant director Todd Simkin, while 
showing students in the field how 
the company operates.
Minimally, we want to ex
pose [students] to how we 
make decisions, Simkin said. 
Poker players need to make 
expert decisions out of un
certainty and allocate capital 
based on those uncertainties.

Moroco, a senior biological

research and has led her sorority 
through the process of becoming a 
nationally affiliated organization.
When shes not in class, Moroco 
volunteers in the Magee-Womens 
Hospital breast cancer clinical re
search program. When her uncle 
was diagnosed with cancer a few 
years ago, she decided she wanted 
to research the disease so people 
didnt have to go through the pain
of losing loved ones anymore.
I have since realized through 
my work at Magee that a cure 
for cancer will never exist, she 
said. But... there is much work 
to be done.
Moroco currendy works in a 
lab at the Hillman Cancer Cen
ter, one of the largest networks 
for cancer care in the country. 
She researches genes and their 
targets relating to cancer.
I love working there because 
I get to do experiments all day, 
and I know that as small as my 
contribution may seem right 
now, I know it will do some 
good and be worth it in the long 
run, Moroco said.

Students bring tech 
support to third world
by James Tetlow
Staffwriter
Technology is everywhere 
 from flat-screen TVs to one 
of the Robotics Clubs new
est mobots. But for developing 
communities around the world, 
technology can be much harder 
to find. That is why robotics pro
fessor Bernardine Dias founded 
TechBridgeWorld, an organiza
tion devoted to the implementa
tion of technological solutions 
for developing communities.
To me, it is about empow
ering students and children 
around the world, Dias said. 
I love those ah-ha moments 
when their eyes light up.
Dias,' who grew up in Sri 
Lanka and came to the U.S. for 
college, founded the program in 
2004.
The initiative began the pre
vious fall as a single class for 
students interested in bringing 
technology to underdeveloped 
nations. It was first taught by 
Dias and Rahul Tongia, a senior 
systems scientist in computer 
science and engineering and 
public policy. The class is now 
titled Technology for Develop
ing Communities and has been 
joined by several other classes 
and an independent study pro
gram for graduate students. 
Dias still teaches the class.
Its about helping organiza
tions with implementing new 
technology planning, said Joe 
Mertz, TechBridgeWorlds as
sociate director and a professor 
in computer science and public 
policy.
Mertz directs Technical Con
sulting in the Global Community 
(TCGC), an elective course that 
sends university students abroad 
for 10 weeks as technology con
sultants with government minis
tries and nonprofit organizations 
in developing communities.
They didnt have power half 
the time, sometimes no water, 
and tuberculosis was a big prob
lem, said Conrad Woodring, a 
recent graduate who went to the 
island of Ebeye in the Marshall 
Islands as part of the course.
Woodring and his partner, 
Daniel Dvinov, worked as techni
cal consultants for the Bureau of 
Kwajalein Atoll Health Care Ser
vices, helping to manage a satel
lite program. Woodring said one 
of the hardest part of the course 
was getting used to the local pace 
of life.
The culture moved so much 
slower, he said. People have a 
different way of learning things, 
and it was tough learning the cul
tural boundaries.
Other students in the program 
were involved with organizations 
in areas such as Palau, Chile, and 
Sri Lanka. Their duties ranged 
from teaching hospital techni
cians in Palau basic computer 
skills to writing an informational 
brochure in English for a non
profit organization in Sri Lanka.
The project is very tough, very 
challenging, said Bridget Lewis, 
a senior in human-computer in
teraction and physicjs. There 
were times when I wanted to go 
home, and others when I was 
like, This is amazing!

I bumped into former student body 
president Tom Sabram last week. As 
we caught up, I mentioned that this 
year has felt more subdued than past 
years. There has not been a single 
widespread controversy, unlike what 
we have seen in years past. Tom jok
ingly reminded me there is plenty of 
time left.
All of the major controversies I can 
remember from my time here can be 
connected by one thread: All of them 
involved students engaging in some 
form of expression that offended the 
sensibilities of other students.
Given that connection, there was 
some level of concern among student 
organization leaders when President 
Cohon formed a committee to review 
the Controversial Speakers Policy in 
August of 2005.
Last week, Associate Vice-Provost for 
Enrollment Michael Murphy delivered 
the committees recommendation to 
the Undergraduate Student Senate for 
consideration. The proposal incorpo
rates a revision of the Carnegie Mellon 
University Policy on Free Speech and 
Assembly and Controversial Speakers, 
a set of concrete guidelines for planning 
campus events, and a newly proposed 
policy on the presence of independent 
security personnel on campus.
The policy in place today is a strong 
statement in favor of free expression. 
Its a policy of which we should all be 
proud.
Cohon created the committee to re
view this policy in 2005, just months 
after a set of lecturers drew outrage 
from some parts of the Jewish commu
nity that spring semester. I was afraid 
it would let the discomfort of conflict 
curtail the open-mindedness of our 
community.
It was a legitimate concern.
Malik Zulu Shabazz  who is out
right racist against whites and Jews 
and the was most controversial of that 
semesters speakers  was a member 
of the Black Panther Party for Self 
Defense, which is unrelated to the 
Black Panther Party. In the weeks after 
Shabazz made his stop at Carnegie 
Mellon, a member of the Progressive 
Students Alliance, Daniel Papasian, 
organized a lecture given by a mem
ber from the real Black Panther Party, 
Ashanti Alston. Then dean of Student 
Affairs, Murphy  who ended up 
chairing the committee to revise the 
Controversial Speakers Policy  gave 
serious consideration to canceling the 
lecture in the interest of pre-empting 
a situation that had the risk of exac
erbating the controversy on campus. 
Fortunately, Murphy considered our 
right to hear, consider, and make our 
own decisions and did not cancel the 
lecture.
Now with the committees proposal 
open for public review and discussion, 
its clear that respect for those rights 
were in the mind of everyone involved, 
committee and general community 
member alike.
Reading the proposed policy, the 
committee has done us a great ser
vice. Though the text has lost some of 
its crisp, potent language, the policys 
spirit of open-mindedness and free
dom of inquiry was resoundingly af
firmed. Furthermore, the guidelines it 
sets forth for organizing campus events 
are clear and constructive.
If the policy lacks anything substan
tive, it is that it should more explicitly 
require protestors to be peaceful in 
their disapproval. Their right to protest 
is affirmed, as it should be. It should be 
clear that they do not have the right to 
prevent others from hearing a speaker 
with whom they disagree.
If controversy does arise this year, 
this policy proposal leaves me confi
dent that our community will be ready 
to allow the controversy to run its 
course appropriately.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 6, 2006
Initiative brings technology around the world
TECHBRIDGE, from A1
tants for the Centro Informatico 
at the Universidad Austral de 
Chile'in Valdiva.
In addition to the TCGC pro
gram, Mertz also teaches Tech
nical Consulting in the Commu
nity (15-391), in which students 
learn technical consulting skills 
by expanding the information 
technology of local nonprofit or
ganizations. One benefit of the 
course is that it can help prepare 
students for TechBridgeWorlds 
overseas programs such as TCGC 
or a V-Unit project.
The V-Unit is an independent 
study program for graduate stu
dents whose purpose is for stu
dents to grow a vision of what 
computer science and technol
ogy can do for society in non-traditional and under-funded areas. 
Students are expected to apply 
their skills in computer science 
and technology to issues faced 
by a local or foreign partner or
ganization.
Ayorkor Mills-Tettey, a gradu
ate student in robotics, designed 
a field study for his final project 
in the class. He later went to 
Ghana to implement the study.
The study, now titled Project 
Kane, involved using an auto
mated reading tutor developed 
at Carnegie Mellon as a teaching 
aid for Ghanaian children.
The inspiration was from 
knowing how much of a chal
lenge illiteracy is in Ghana, said 
Mills-Tettey, who spent a month 
in Accra, Ghana, working with 
children at the Abossey Okai 
Anglican A Primary School as 
part of the pilot study for the pro
gram.
Many children in Ghana read 
well below their grade level and 
speak a native language at home 
while attending classes in Eng
lish.
The study involved 18 chil
dren from grades two through 
four who worked with the read
ing tutor. Twelve students used 
the reading tutor 30 minutes a 
day for three weeks at a local In
ternet caf, while the other six 
children used the reading tutor 
at home about two or three times 
a week.
The children were great, 
Mills-Tettey said. They felt re
ally special because they got the 
chance to leave school and use a 
computer.
Many of these students had 
never used a computer before, 
and none of them spoke English 
as their primary language.
It brought home how these 
kids dont really have a lot of op
portunity in their lives, MillsTettey said. Even this small 
opportunity meant a lot to them.
Students in Technology for
Developing Communities are 
currently designing the second 
phase of Project Kane.
In addition to her work with 
Project Kane, Mills-Tettey also 
taught an undergraduate course 
in robotics to students at Asheshi 
University in Ghana as part of the 
TechBridgeWorld initiative.
Other V-Unit projects have fo
cused on helping children with 
disabilities. Robotics graduate 
students Nidhi Kalra and Tom 
Lauwers designed and imple
mented an electronic Braille writ
ing tutor in collaboration with 
the Mathru School for the Blind 
in Bangalore, India. Lauwers and 
Kalra are currently designing a 
new version of the slate, which 
will have a much larger Braille 
cell so that children will be able 
to use it more easily.
The biggest advantage is that 
when youre first teaching people 
Braille, the feedback is delayed, 
Lauwers said. This system gives 
instant feedback on what the 
user typed, so you can tell the 
child what happened.
Lauwers said the electronic 
slates have been very popular at 
the school.
Robotics graduate students 
Vinithra Varadharajan and Ling 
Xu are developing another tool 
for disabled children. The two 
are working with the Western 
Pennsylvania School for the Deaf
to develop a computer program 
which will help teach American 
Sign Language to children at the 
school.
Were actually going to ap
ply this in a real-world situation, 
with the intention to use it in a 
good way and making a differ
ence, Varadharajan said. Cur
rently the pair is exchanging emails with the professor to work 
on the programs software so that 
it matches the schools needs.
We came up with this project, 
and that was an experience on its 
own, said Xu. Varadharajan will 
be graduating soon, but Xu will 
remain at Carnegie Mellon and 
plans on keeping in touch with 
the teacher after the project is 
finished.
While TechBridgeWorld has 
traditionally focused on educa
tion, the organization is looking 
to grow in new directions.
One of our immediate goals 
is disaster response, said Dias. 
I was in Sri Lanka when the 
tsunami hit. There was so much 
chaos, and so little resources.
Dias also wants to focus more 
on health care initiatives, though 
he said it depends on what stu
dents are most interested in.
TechBridgeWorld will be pre- senting a lecture on the Braille 
writing tutor project this Tues
day at 11 a.m. in Newell-Simon 
Hall 3305.

Student assaulted with gun
by David E. Chen
Staffwriter
A man assaulted a student, 
produced a gun, and threat
ened to shoot two other stu
dents during a social event 
at the Theta Xi house on 
October 29 around 1 a.m. The 
man was unaffiliated with 
the university, according to a 
University Police crime alert 
issued on October 31.
The gun confrontation oc
curred as the actor was leav
ing the Theta Xi house, on 
the fraternity quad, during a 
party.
A Theta Xi brother alerted 
guests that someone had 
pulled a gun, according to 
Joanna Fanuko, a sophomore 
in business administration 
who attended the party.
[My friends and I] were 
sort of freaked out by it, and 
we ran to the corner of the 
room, Fanuko said. ,
The actor ran to a car 
parked on Devon Road and 
drove down Forbes Avenue 
towards Oakland in an at
tempt to flee the scene.
A witness at the PAT bus 
shelter in front of the Cut 
was able to describe that 
actors vehicle to a University 
Police security guard who 
was patrolling the area.
University Police followed 
the suspects vehicle and 
pulled it over after it be
came caught in traffic at the 
intersection of Morewood 
and Fifth avenues. Police 
arrested him and trans
ported him to the Allegheny 
County Jail. The suspect did 
not resist arrest, the crime 
alert stated.
Police also found a darkcolored .22 caliber BB gun 
inside the vehicle.
The assault victim did not 
require any immediate medi
cal attention. The two other 
victims were not harmed.
The suspect has been 
released on bail and is await
ing a preliminary hearing 
next week, according to Uni
versity Police Chief Creig 
Doyle.
This is a very unusual in
cident, Doyle said. I cant 
remember the last time we 
had any gun incident.
Students try Heinz Field break-in

where they are now. They also 
were unclear as to why the pair 
wanted to enter Heinz Field.
I think they were just playing 
around, Durvasulas roommate 
said, who asked that his name 
not appear in print.
The roommate noted that he 
had not received any information 
about the two students where
abouts, nor had he spoken to 
either of them since the incident 
occurred. The only contact he 
had with police, he said, was 
when they came to search the 
apartment that he shares with 
Durvasula.
I think theyre in jail now,
he said.
. Both were charged with crimi

dent Greek organization, become 
nationally affiliated.
Ive learnt as president that 
the key to getting a job done is 
through delegation, she said. 
Its impossible to get work done 
if you try doing it all yourself. 
As president of Alpha Chi 
Omega, Moroco wants to change 
the way sorority life is portrayed 
and hopes to break the stereo
types people hold of it.
If a bad thing happens in the 
sorority, people know about it. 
But the good things are not pub
licized, she said.
Jamie is an excellent leader in 
the Greek community, said Rho
Lambda President Emily Rhodes, 
a senior biology major. Rhodes 
said Moroco always supports 
other sororities and participates 
in their philanthropy events.
Jamie is always willing go the 
extra mile to make.sure that her 
organization is well represented, 
Rhodes said.
Moroco is also pushing herself 
academically. Along with her reg
ular course load, she is taking a 
graduate-level class in advanced 
molecular biology.
She is also an active member of 
biological sciences student advi
sory council and currently in the 
process of applying to graduate 
school in molecular biology for a 
concentration in cancer biology.
Its pressing at times. But Im 
not going to lie  I like to be the 
center of attention, she said. 
The more I do, the better orga
nized I am, because I have more 
to remember.
Hailing from a town an hour 
outside Pittsburgh, Moroco has 
stayed very close with her family 
and hopes to stay close to home 
even after graduation.
Her future plans include lab 
research, possibly on cancer, and 
teaching college students.
If I could, I would go audition 
for American Idol and if [I was] 
better at it, Id probably [study] 
drama, she said. But I cant re
ally cure cancer with a drama 
degree.

MBA student uses business skills to win $6000 in poker
POKER, from Al
Cole, who is on the clubs board, de
cided to attend the conference at the 
urging of a recruiter from SIG who 
visited campus.
We had a good conversation, and 
I like to play poker, Centeno said. 
He said he didnt realize the amount 
of money  about $75,000 total 
feet information, Centeno said. It helps 
with decision-making under uncertainty 
and understanding basic probabilistic 
and psychological conditions. Theres a 
lot of transferability.
Cole stated that poker has improved 
his ability to make quick mathematical 
calculations, read people, and constantly 
assess information.
All these skills translate well into the
You shouldnt play poker with your 
rent money and you shouldnt play 
more than you can afford,
John Centeno
that the company was offering in prizes. 
Cole said that the chance to win some 
money and be interviewed by the firm 
added to the events appeal.
Centeno came in fifth place. First 
prize, which was $25,000, went to an 
MIT student.
Both Centeno and Cole believe 
that the skills theyve acquired 
as poker players regularly help 
them in their coursework as 
MBA students.
In poker, youre constantly 
Ho-Jung Kim/Art staff making decisions based on imperbusiness world and my studies, he wrote 
in an e-mail. This summer I worked at 
Constellation Energys trading business, 
and the ability to quickly synthesize in
formation and make decisions is key. 
The pair are no,t the only ones who have 
caught on to pokers benefits. Simkin re
ported that five years ago, about 5 per
cent of students resumes that he viewed 
mentioned that they played poker. Today, 
he estimates that its about 80 percent. 
He believes that the popularity of tele
vised poker tournaments has added to 
the games appeal.
Cole believes that the growth of online 
poker sites has also made poker playing 
more common. However, he expects that 
current legislation to ban fund transfers 
from customers to online gaming sites 
will lessen its popularity.
Centeno has also noticed a rise in the 
number of people playing poker. Last 
years MBA poker tournament, he said, 
was capped at 500 players; this year, its 
1500. He thinks the social aspect of the 
game is partly responsible for the surge.
Its a networking thing, he said. 
Poker is the new golf.
Centeno has been playing since 2002, 
when he was a college senior. Since then, 
he estimates that hes won $7000-$8000 
overall. Most of this money was made af
ter graduation when he played poker full 
time for three months. r
I derived the majority of my income 
from poker during that time, Centeno 
said.
He said that he adds that information 
to his resume, along with being president 
of the universitys graduate poker club, 
when he thinks its applicable.
But poker is not just a graduate stu
dents sport. Undergrads are also getting 
in on the game..
Janice Weinberg, a sophomore infor
mation systems major, estimates that 
she plays online poker about five hours 
a week. She said she knows a good 
amount of fellow students who also play 
poker online.
Weinberg said shes broken even since 
she started playing. Another H&SS soph
omore, who requested to remain anony
mous, said hes made about $5000 in the 
past three years that hes been playing 
online poker.
Senior business major Donald Nor
man plays for higher stakes. He estimates 
that hell make $100,000 this fiscal year 
alone.
Norman, whose parents do not sup
port him financially, has paid his tuition 
entirely with his poker earnings. He plans 
to put his future earnings toward buying 
a Ferrari and a yacht this summer.
Norman said that poker has helped to 
improve his interperative analysis skills, 
which he finds important as a business 
major.
When I found out poker was a skill 
game I thought, If anyone can make 
money off it I can, Norman wrote in an 
e-mail. Im a business major and a busi
nessman first and foremost.
Next year, his goal is to make $500,000 
in poker winnings.
If I only make [$200,000], Ill [defi
nitely] be disappointed in myself, Nor
man stated. I think I can retire by the 
time Im 26 if I keep improving.
Despite these successes, both Centeno 
and Norman have experienced pokers 
downside. Centeno has lost $2500 in half 
an hour; Norman has lost $1000 in a sin
gle hand.
For these reasons they urge students to 
play responsibly.
You shouldnt play poker with your 
rent money and you shouldnt play more 
than you can afford, Centeno said. You 
should be focused on making the best de
cision at any given time.
Campus International Festival promotes global health
Students exposed to cultures of over 40 countries; highlights include guest speakers, films, yoga, ethnic food
FESTIVAL, from Al
nationally acclaimed organization Doc
tors Without Borders.
I think travel should be a part of ev
eryones education, he told a full house 
of students, faculty, and staff in Rangos 
Ballroom last Friday. He addressed is
sues in many of the countries whose flags 
adorned Rangos walls.
Heinzl spoke about the Internets ef
fect on small villages, the biggest health 
problems affecting developing nations 
today, and his unique medical education 
at McCallister University in Canada.
His speech was optimistic. He said 4 
million people in the world have never 
made a phone call, but countered this
stat with several stories of advancements 
in quality of life and emergency care that 
the Internet has catalyzed.
Heinzls speech drew a large crowd. 
Half, who has also been the head coordi
nator of the festival for seven years, esti
mated that 250 people attended Heinzls 
speech.
Ive been at the university for seven 
years, and this year is the biggest turnout 
since Ive been here, Half said.
She suspects that the lectures move 
from Thursday night to Friday at lunch
time contributed to the increased atten
dance.
Other speakers at the festival included 
Reverend Kyoki Roberts, a Soto Zen Bud
dhist priest and founding member of the
Order of the Prairie Wind; Khadra Mo
hammed, director of the Pittsburgh Refu
gee Center; Kevin Henry, a drum circle 
facilitator and Udu drum expert; and 
several Carnegie Mellon and University 
of Pittsburgh faculty and staff members 
who spoke about psychology, history, 
medicine, and theater.
On Friday, students could view the 
recently acclaimed film The Lost Boys of 
Sudan, a movie about two young Darfur 
refugees adapting to the American sub
urbs. Saturday featured Al Gores envi
ronmental documentary An Inconvenient 
Truth on McConomy Auditoriums big 
screen.
Students also had the opportunity 
to take workshops on the Astanga
yoga breathing technique, Latin-fusion 
and African-Caribbean dance, acupunc
ture, shiatsu, aikido, and Zen medita
tion.
The arts also played a role in the week
end, with an exhibit in the University 
Art Gallery titled Art as Therapy and 
a reading of School of Drama graduate 
playwright France-Luce Bensons Silence 
oftheMambo.
The reading told the story of a Haitian 
woman with a haunting past and was 
set in 1986 Haiti. It was a psychological 
Jekyll-and-Hyde affair featuring perfor
mances by barefoot players thrusting 
shoulders and bobbing hips to the beat of 
an offstage hand drum.
For international explorers looking for
lighter fare, there were several oppor
tunities to gorge. Pi Delta Psis scallion

People just kind of swept in and ate 
everything in only 20 minutes, said 
sophomore industrial design major Kate 
Edgar.
On Saturday, the International Ba
zaar and Marketplace brought together 
outside vendors to share an even wider 
variety of international meals. Custom

Getting 
under the 
skin: The 
darker side 
of tanning
by Shawn Wertz
Science & Technology Editor
The people who walk out of Hot 
Tamale Tanning and Massage 
all have one thing in common: 
Theyre tan. Whether in the dead 
of winter or in the middle of sum
mer, they look as if theyve spent 
hours on the beach.
The tanning salon, located in 
its tropical location 10 minutes 
south of downtown Pittsburgh, is 
owned by Shannon Morgan, who 
herself sports a tan year-round. 
As owner, she caters to a diverse 
clientele.
Right now a lot of people are 
coming in to get ready for vaca
tions and to get a base tan before 
they get completely fried, Mor
gan said. But not everyone goes 
tanning as a means of pre-vaca
tion prep.
A lot of people tan because they
Morgan said. I cant explain 
it, but you just feel better when 
youre tan. I know I do.
Having a slight tan used to be a 
sign of good health. But research 
conducted by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration suggests 
that tanning, whether in the 
sun or in a bed, can significantly 
increase a persons chance of get
ting skin cancer, leaving some 
doctors to question just how 
healthy a healthy tan is for your 
skin.
Out of all human organs, skin 
has the greatest surface area. Its 
also the heaviest, typically ac
counting for nearly 15 percent 
of a persons body weight. On 
average, a square inch of skin 
contains 650 sweat glands, over 
1000 nerve endings, and up to
60,000 melanocytes.
Melanocytes are cells that pro
duce the pigments eumelanin
U1.U J.i.uv.v-uiv.mmil, ure
responsible for brown and yellow 
skin tones, respectively. When 
a person tans, he or she exposes 
him or herself to ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation, either from the sun or 
from a tanning beds UV bulbs.
After short periods of exposure 
to UV rays, melanocytes begin to 
produce melanin in order to pro
tect themselves against future 
UV exposure. The more UV expo
sure, the more melanin, and the 
darker a persons tan is.
Beginning tanners can run 
the risk of getting too much UV 
exposure because some do not 
have enough melanin built up in 
their skin. This only applies to 
Caucasian tanners, because those 
with darker skin already have 
high levels of melanin.
When tanners are exposed to 
UV rays for too long, they experi
ence what is typically known as 
sunburn, a condition that leaves
the skin red and painful. This is 
because the human bodys re
sponse to intense UV exposure is 
to pump blood into the base of the 
skin, known as the capillary bed. 
As the capillary bed fills with 
blood, skin becomes noticeably 
red.
But sunburn isnt all that a new 
tanner needs to worry about. 
Medical research shows that 
there is strong correlation be
tween having sunburn early in 
life and the development of skin 
cancer later on. And that goes for 
veteran tanners, too.
There are three different types 
of skin cancer: basal cell, squa
mous cell, and melanoma. Out 
of the three, melanoma is the 
most aggressive form because it 
can spread from the skin to other 
places in the body.
The Census Bureaus most 
recent statistics indicate that 
during last year alone, 60,000
Justin Brown/Assistant Photo Editor
new cases of melanoma were 
reported in the U.S. Thats ap
proximately the equivalent of 
filling Heinz Field with people 
and diagnosing them with a po
tentially fatal condition.
But there are some who are 
more at risk than others. Ju
dith Arluk, a dermatologist in 
Forest Hills, just east of Pitts
burgh, said that burns are more 
common in people who are fair
skinned. Arluk also said that a 
persons skin type determines 
how the sun affects him or her.
There are six different skin 
types, ranging from extremely 
fair to extremely dark. The 
fairer a persons skin, the 
greater the risk of being burnt 
by overexposure and the 
greater the risk of developing 
cancer later in life. As a result, 
doctors like Arluk see patients

Carnegie Mellon SCS Ph.D.s ranked first by U.S. News & World Report
a while. Frank Pfenning, head 
of the universitys Computer Sci
ence graduate program, said that 
one reason for the success of SCS 
is the support that it provides its 
students.
Pfenning said that SCS admits 
students with the idea that every 
single student that we can admit 
will be able to succeed through 
the program.
In particular, SCS matches 
each student with an advisor dur
ing the first year of study.
Pfenning said that this makes 
students feel engaged in the en
vironment that they will be in for 
six years.
We match the student right 
away so they will be essentially 
in good hands from the first day, 
Pfenning said.
SCS faculty also meet twice 
a year to discuss the progress of 
each student. In these meetings, 
faculty members discuss each 
students achievements and fu
ture direction. The advisor then 
provides feedback to the student 
in the form of a letter.
Another attribute of SCS is its 
interdisciplinary approach to
computer science school is at 
the top for other reasons.
The public relations ^ 
manager for
computer science.
Pfenning said that the depart
ment views computer science as 
relating to many different sci
ences, including psychology, sta
tistics, and biology.
In particular, Carnegie Mel
lon received a grant in 1999 to 
partner with the University A 
of Pittsburgh to form a /
Ph.D. program in chemil 
istry and computational 
biology, the study of 111

students and professors to 
form teams that might not oth

on problems.
These problems are in many 
fields, ranging from biology 
to business to artificial intel

How Things Work: Electronic Voting Machines
David Chen
Tomorrow, voters across the 
country will cast their ballots 
and decide which political can
didates will take which offices. 
But things will be a little dif
ferent this year for the areas 
voters: They will be using new 
electronic touchscreen devices. 
Electronic voting machines are 
steadily replacing traditional 
paper and mechanical ballots 
across the country.
Most of these voting devices 
are technically described as 
Direct Recording Electronic 
(DRE) voting machines be
cause they store votes electroni
cally. DRE machines are differ
ent from some other electronic 
voting machines which have 
electronic interfaces but do not 
record data electronically.
Allegheny County has se
lected Electronic Systems & 
Software, Inc., as the vendor 
for the countys new electronic 
voting machines. The company 
is the creator of the iVotronic 
machine.
The iVotronic electronic vot
ing machine has a full-color 
touchscreen that serves as the 
primary interface between the 
voter and the machine.
The machine is designed for 
universal accessibility. For the 
visually disabled, it features 
buttons with Braille instruc
tions and headphone support 
as an alternative to the touch
screen.
A Vote button above the 
screen allows the voter to final
ize and cast the ballot.
The electronic voting ma
chine is activated by a device 
called a Ballot Activator Car
tridge (BAC). The BAC is in
serted into the BAC slot located 
right beside the electronic 
screen by a poll worker. Activa
tion by a poll worker makes it 
more difficult for the voter to 
vote more than once.
The BAC communicates with 
the electronic voting machine 
once it is plugged into the slot. 
The appropriate ballot for the

Him
voter is downloaded from the 
BAC to the electronic voting ma
chine. When the initial screen is 
loaded, the BAC is removed and 
the voter is instructed to follow 
the on-screen directions.
Instructions on how to navi
gate the voting screen are dis
played to the voter. The naviga
tion is based on buttons on the 
touchscreen.
The first button the voter 
presses is the View Ballot but
ton, which loads the electronic 
ballot. A voter then decides by 
pressing a button if he or she 
wants to vote down the ticket 
for a particular political party 
or split the ballot.
If a voter decides to split his 
or her ballot, he or she is given 
a list of candidates. The voter 
then touches the candidate 
or proposition to be selected. 
When a candidate or proposi
tion is selected, a check mark 
appears to its left to provide 
visual confirmation. The voter
may also select to write in a 
vote. By selecting the WriteIn button, a keyboard appears 
on the screen. The voter can 
then type in a name.
A Next button and a Back 
button are displayed on appli
cable screens so the voter can 
move forward and back be
tween pages.
When the voter reaches the 
last selection page, a Review 
button prompts the voter to con
tinue to the summary screen, 
where changes can be made.
From the summary screen, 
the voter may either make 
changes or cast the ballot with 
the use of an on-screen button 
or the Vote button above the 
screen.
If the voter chooses to cast 
the ballot, another screen is 
displayed asking the voter to 
confirm his or her choice. The 
voter must press the Confirm 
button, or else the vote does not 
count.
David Kjos/Assistant Art Editor
If the voter does confirm the 
ballot, the machine then saves 
the vote to three internal flash 
memory chips.
At the end of an election, 
the electronic voting machine 
is closed with the BAC and a 
supervisor password. During 
the closing process, summary 
vote data from the machine are 
transmitted to the BAC. The 
vote data are also written to a 
CompactFlash card.
A printer pack may be used to 
print the result summary data 
or to transmit the data via a 
built-in modem.
The BAC, any printed data, 
and the CompactFlash card are 
brought to a central location for 
tabulation, where an electronic 
vote tabulator calculates the re
sults.
But for machines in Penn
sylvania, it is currently against 
state law to print out a voters 
results; voter information will 
exist in electronic form only.
Tanning not so attractive
TAN, from A6
daily who used to get burned 
and have developed melanoma.
I see it every single day, said 
Arluk. It is because of her expe
rience that she discourages her 
patients from tanning. I tell 
my patients to just burn their 
money, because its not any bet
ter to burn their skin.
Arluk has seen other effects 
of tanning as well. Devoted tan
ners often end up with thin skin, 
and they tend to bruise easily. 
They get all kinds of problems, 
Arluk said.
So how does all of this relate 
to people like clients of Shannon 
Morgans Hot Tamale?
Tanning beds use UV bulbs 
to emit rays similar to those 
from the sun. When they went 
on the market in the late 1970s, 
tanning beds used UV B bulbs, 
which emit short-wave radiation 
and can actually cause burn
ing. When this was discovered, 
the tanning industry began re
placing the original UV B bulbs 
with UV A bulbs, which emit 
long-wave radiation and are less 
likely to cause burning.
But research from the Federal 
Trade Commission suggests that 
there is a strong link between 
UV A radiation and melanoma 
occurrence. UV A rays have also 
been proven to weaken the im
mune system. But what about all 
those people who tan because it 
makes them feel better?
A 2004 study conducted by re
searchers at Wake Forest Univer
sity Baptist Medical Center sug
gests that exposure to UV light 
may produce a relaxing effect. 
For six weeks, 14 subjects went 
to tanning sessions on Mondays
and Wednesdays. The subjects 
spent half of their sessions in 
one bed and half in another. The 
difference between the two beds 
was that only one actually emit
ted UV rays.
Mood was measured before 
and after sessions. The results 
suggested that greater stress 
relief and relaxation occurred 
after UV exposure compared 
to non-UV exposure. Further 
proponents of tanning say that 
tanning makes them feel good 
because exposure to UV rays re
plenishes vitamin D.
But John Zitelli tells a different story. Tanning bed people 
encourage others to do more tan
ning because they need vitamin 
D, which is ridiculous. You really 
need only minimal exposure to 
get enough, Zitelli said. If you 
walk to your car and its sunny 
out  thats all the exposure you 
need to get enough vitamin D.
Zitelli called himself an endof-the-line doctor. Over the past
27 years at his practices in Shadyside and South Hills, he has 
seen the most serious cases of 
skin cancer.
Zitelli makes -sure his family 
avoids overexposure to UV pro
tection, and tells his patients to 
do the same.
Ive seen the ones where 
the cancer invades through the 
bones and into the brain, Zitelli 
said. Ive had to cut off hands, 
limbs, and even noses because of 
skin cancer.
And with approximately
60,000 new cases every year, 
the price of tanning could mean 
a lot more to a lot of people than 
just dollars and cents  it could 
mean a trip to an end-of-theline doctor.

searchers are currently working 
to build STAIR (Stanford AI Ro
bot), a robot designed to assist 
people in their homes and of

the robot to be able to create a 
bookshelf using tools like screw

colleague from his or her office.
Additionally, in the field of

Forum
This Tuesday, the stakes are 
high for Pa., the Union at large
_______________________________________November 6, 2006Aio THE TARTAN
Julia Li/Art Staff
Welcome to participatory democracy
On Tuesday, the emphasis is on participatory
Surely anyone whos walked around 
campus or even up towards the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh lately has been 
stopped and asked politely if he or she 
has registered to vote. Everyone on this 
campus has heard about the importance 
of voting; even so, those of us who were 
old enough to vote in the presidential 
election of 2004 may have been disillu
sioned when the country went to Bush, 
or conversely when the state of Pennsyl
vania went to Kerry.
While midterm elections are rarely as 
exciting as presidential races, there is a 
lot on the line in 2006. Be counted.
Cripple Bush, or keep him strong
Whether you vote blue, red, green, or 
otherwise, you can affect what happens 
to the Bush administration in the next 
two years even though Dubya himself is 
not on the ballot.
On NPRs All Things Considered last 
Friday, David Brooks, a columnist for the 
New York Times, announced his predic
tion for the Senate and the House  a 
27-seat increase for Democrats in the 
House and 50/50 split in the Senate.
A Senate evenly split or a Senate with 
more Democrats than Republicans could 
effectively cripple the Bush administra
tions initiatives in the next two years. A 
27-seat gain for House Democrats would 
mean the House would hold 229 Demo
crats and 205 Republicans, assuming 
one of the Democratic pick-ups will 
not be the one independent seat in the 
House. If Brooks is right, and Democrats 
rule the House and split the Senate, 
Bushs more controversial or conserva
tive plans for the rest of his term will be 
halted.
Whether you want to see Bush weak
ened or want to prevent the kind of over
turn that Brooks predicts, the ballot is 
the only way to ensure that your opinion 
is taken into account.
Get past the negative energy
We understand if you have a little bit 
of healthy distrust for the government, 
but the best way to change it is to par
ticipate in its processes. Distrust was 
written into the Constitution, after all; 
it is why we have the Bill of Rights. You 
might be inclined to believe that your 
vote ends up in a trash pail, but even 
that is in the hands of the voters. Dont 
like the Electoral College? Fight to en
act change. The only way to resolve any
personal reservations you may have 
about our voting process is to be active 
in civics.
It can be discouraging to be a voter to
day. Issues like abortion, immigration, 
and the war in Iraq can often lead to 
screaming matches. Thats why we en
courage you to make educated decisions 
based on, at least, what you read on can
didate websites or in newspapers.
It is unlikely that one vote will change 
the course of history, but one action can 
certainly influence the actor; by learn
ing about candidates and voting ac
cordingly, we become more active and 
enlightened about the political climate. 
We giggle in front of the television when 
the cheesy The More You Know ads 
come on, but they have a point. How can 
we recognize the need for change if we 
dont take the time to form an opinion 
on what needs changing?
The yelling, screaming, and fearmongering that are so often the tactic 
of the far left and the far right insult 
American intelligence  and the highvolume debating is often, sadly, mim
icked in the form of campaign ads. One 
candidate running for Congress in Colo
rado even stooped so low as to design a 
mailer to look like a sex offender noti
fication. The point of the mailer was to 
announce that the candidates opponent 
was soft on crime, but it made it look as 
if his opponent was a sex offender mov
ing to the area.
Between sleazy, insulting ads and 
partisan screaming matches, we un
derstand if you get a headache at the 
thought of voting. But once again, the 
only way to show you dont appreciate 
this behavior is to vote against candi
dates who employ these odious tactics 
in their ads or who cant debate without 
resorting to insults.
We are not Generation Apathy
Even the few who arent salivating at 
the thought of helping or hindering Bush 
should consider voting insurance for the 
future. Civic participation works best 
and remains strongest when it begins at 
a young age; in other words, get in the 
habit now. By taking an hour off to cast 
your ballot, you are working to ensure 
that you will continue to vote well into 
your adult life.
Voting among our generation is actu
ally on the rise, but many people still 
think we young adults are tuned in to 
nothing but our iPods. Votes among
people under 30 increased by 4.6 mil
lion in 2004, according to the Center 
for Information and Research on Civic 
Learning and Engagement. Midterm 
elections have historically had a lower 
turnout among all voters  especially 
young voters  so it is especially impor
tant to shut the mouths of the naysayers 
by voting in this midterm election.
Take a chance to invest in not just the 
future of your civic participation, but 
also the future of your country. Part of 
the reason we vote is to enact change or 
maintain those policies and politicians 
that we believe are good. Chances are 
that if you are a U.S. citizen attending a 
university here, then you are planning to 
start your professional life in the States. 
It would be a damned shame to wake up 
after your graduation, $120,000 poorer, 
and realize that you hate the country 
you live in.
The cop-outs are more numerous than 
the candidates, but the most popular ex
cuse in the book for political inaction is 
I dont like anyone whos running.
Bull.
Spend five minutes with yourself and 
then five minutes online, and youll find 
someone you can support. What do you 
believe in? Do you think its humane to 
water-board detainees if it will save in
nocent lives? Do you think Americas 
working class deserves a higher mini
mum wage, or do you think it will cost 
jobs and cause more poverty?
If you can find neither donkey nor 
elephant to suit your views, turn to a 
third-party candidate. From the Green 
Party to the Pan-Sexual Peace Party to 
the Pirate Party, we guarantee that you 
can find like-minded people.
Still unsatisfied? Start your own party. 
What good will that do? Probably not 
much, admittedly. Take comfort in the 
wisdom of John Quincy Adams: Always 
vote for principle, though you may vote 
alone, and you may cherish the sweetest 
reflection that your vote is never lost.
Cast the ballot
With all of this said, wed like to say 
we hope youll grace the polls with your 
presence tomorrow. If youve cast your 
absentee ballot already, more power to 
you. If youre voting for the first time, 
congratulations, and welcome to par
ticipatory democracy. As the adage 
goes, its the absolute worst form of gov
ernment in the world. Except for all the 
others.
Benjamin Hackett
You have seen the commercials, been 
deluged by radio ads, and been mailed 
all sorts of political advice concern
ing the 2006 midterm elections. Now, 
kindly allow time for some clarifica
tion on the stakes and potential conse
quences of the 2006 midterm elections. 
Pennsylvania is a liberal-leaning battle
ground state, is facing some interest
ing and important elections. Under ex
amination, here are the Pennsylvania 
gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races.
First, in the race for governor, politi
cal newcomer Lynn Swann is hoping to 
unseat incumbent governor Ed Rendell. 
Rendell is a career politician to whom 
scandal just does not stick. Long ac
cused of various misdeeds, personal 
and professional, Rendell has managed 
to brush them all off. Rendell remains 
popular all around Pennsylvania, es
pecially in. Philadelphia, where he was 
once mayor.
Rendells re-election would support 
a liberal Pennsylvania political estab
lishment that holds a bleak outlook on 
Americas future. At a spech in Wash
ington this year, Rendell painted a 
morbid picture of Americas prospects. 
Rendell spoke about Americas future 
fall and its failure to remain competi
tive worldwide. Rendell dogged on 
Americas hard-working students. He 
explained the superiority of other na
tions students while ignoring the differ
ences between our full public schooling
system and more exclusionary interna
tional systems. >
Governor Rendells continued por
trayal of doom and gloom extends to 
his outlook on the health of the worlds 
economic engine, the United States. 
Rendell completely ignores the expand
ing U.S. trade exports, which topped $1 
trillion in value in 2004. Rendell ignores 
the fact that deficits do not always mean 
economic shrinkage, but rather  in 
the case of some trade deficits : show 
great American economic buying power 
co-existing with the rapid growth of 
U.S. exports.
On the state level Rendell often talks 
about, and delivers, tax increases to fix 
his expected budget deficits. But the 
numbers do not bear out his logic. State 
tax revenues have gone up by nearly 8 
percent since the GOP tax cuts, which 
undercuts Rendells calls for higher 
taxes to fix his invented crisis.
Lynn Swann offers a hope for a return 
of conservative governance to the com
monwealth. Running on a campaign of 
restricting and lowering property taxes, 
government reform through the shrink
ing of government, and economic ex
pansion by support of industry, Swann 
serves as a welcome refresher to what 
governments role should be. Even the 
New York Times calls Swann a classic 
Reagan conservative.
On a national level, many are watch
ing the crucial Bob Casey versus Rick 
Santorum race for U.S. Senate. Senator 
Santorum has been dogged by ultra
leftist smear campaigns, which have 
been successfully overshadowing the 
many years of great work Santorum has 
put in on Capitol Hill. As we approach 
a true crossroads in American culture 
and civilization, losing Rick Santorum 
would weaken us nationally in two ar
eas this nation can least afford it: secu
rity and foreign policy.
Santorum often gets criticized for 
his straight talk and strong ideologi
cal beliefs. Yet, it is exactly this type of 
talk that is needed in the white-wigged 
Senate. Santorum is strong on the cur
rent  and future  struggle between 
Western civilization and the incorrigible 
wing of radical Islam.
Santorum understands the Islamic 
caliphate that Iranian president 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, insurgent 
leader Muqtada al-Sadr, and others 
wish to establish worldwide. In a re
cent speech, he explained a concept 
that many Americans are unwilling to 
believe, stating, There is no escape 
because our enemies are fully commit
ted to our destruction, and they will not 
stop until they have either destroyed us 
or have been destroyed.
Many claim that these honest ac
counts are sensationalist. They are of
ten regarded as fear-mongering, using 
the threat of an enemy to scare Ameri
can voters. However, the role these 
speeches and reports serve is to spread 
the truth about a gathering worldwide 
storm.
Bob Casey Jr. is running on little more 
than his fathers popular name in Penn
sylvania. His political experience is 
limited at best, and non-existent in the 
realm of foreign affairs and the global 
struggle against radical Islam. Concern
ing Casey, Santorum said, From every
thing I can see, Mr. Casey is unready 
and unqualified for high office at a time 
when our survival as a free people is at 
stake. I cannot help but agree.
The stakes are far too high to elect 
unprincipled fence-sitting politicos at 
a time when the United States needs 
strong leadership on the local, federal, 
and international levels.
Disagree with conservatives like 
Swann and Santorum on social issues 
if you must. However, remember that 
government, in its proper small form, 
should be primarily concerned with the 
security of its citizens and the preserva
tion of this Union. Amnesty for illegal 
immigrants, the premature removal 
of forces from Iraq  which al-Qaeda 
now refers to as the largest front in the 
war on terror  higher taxes, and the 
continued destruction of American cul
ture are exactly what you are voting for 
when you vote straight Democrat this 
November.
There are differences; there is a lot on 
the line.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 6, 2006See
With the midterm elections this week, The Tartan wondered,
Why is voter turnout among young people so low, and what should be done to increase it?
A PERSONS OPINION
Compiled by Olga Stradina and Joey Gannon

location. Students should be able to vote on 
campus so it saves traveling time.

are a generation that can make a huge 
difference. The university should arrange 
lectures and documentaries that deal with

They dont vote mainly because of apa
thy, and this can be changed by giving 
them free sniff if they vote, such as Tshirts or food.
John Gross
A month ago, U2 lead singer 
Bono and Bobby Shriver, a 
member of the Kennedy family, 
launched the marketing cam
paign of PRODUCT (RED) in 
the United States. PRODUCT 
(RED) is an effort to raise aware
ness about AIDS, tuberculosis, 
and malaria. This global effort 
would bring millions of dollars 
and resources to the women and 
children in Africa who cannot 
afford healthcare. The help will 
also target other impoverished 
countries, such as Rwanda and 
Swaziland, which together have 
already received $10.25 million 
in the past year.
Collecting million of dollars in 
contributions to the Global Fund 
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and 
Malaria, (RED) has aligned itself 
with several American companies 
including Gap, Apple, Converse, 
and Motorola. After joining 
with (RED), these companies 
have harnessed the wallets and 
emotional support of American 
consumers by marketing their 
PRODUCT (RED)-labeled items 
through advertisements in print 
and on television. American con
sumers can buy (RED) products 
from one of these fine retailers, 
and a generous portion of that 
cost will be given to the estab
lished Global Fund.
But, as a consumer, Im con
cerned. Whatever happened to 
companies just simply donating 
to charity? Is it that unreason
able for companies not to profit
from donating to a worthy cause, 
such as fighting AIDS in Africa? 
Apparently, it is.
In March, Gap publicly an
nounced its devotion to Africas 
health problems by signing a fiveyear deal to sell (RED) products. 
On the surface, it appears that 
Gap genuinely cares about in
creasing the general welfare of 
Africans. Historically speaking, 
this isnt the case. Gap has been 
manufacturing clothing in facto
ries located in Africa for decades, 
in countries including South 
Africa, Kenya, Tunisia, Egypt, 
Madagascar, and Lesotho. And 
working conditions at these plants 
are  and have been  far from 
ideal. As recently as 2002, allega
tions became public that factory 
management at the Lesotho plant 
had interfered with the workers
right to organize legally with the 
workers union. Coincidentally, 
Lesotho is the same place where 
the PRODUCT (RED) Gap T-shirt 
is being produced out of 100 per
cent African cotton. Gaps abil
ity to profit from the devastation 
in Africa is even more shocking. 
With a respectable 50 percent of 
Gaps profits being contributed to 
the Global Fund, Gap has priced 
its PRODUCT (RED) clothing 
items from $28 to $350, with an 
average of about $60 or $70.
To become part of this grow
ing population of charitable 
companies, Apple and Converse 
have also agreed to sell specific 
PRODUCT (RED) editions of 
their items. The special edition 
iPod Nano is priced at either $199 
or $249 depending on capacity, 
and for every one sold, Apple
will generously donate $10 to 
the Global Fund. Converse has 
specially designed its website to 
allow consumers to customize a 
shoe ranging from the color of 
the shoelace to the color of the 
stitching. The cost of each pair 
of shoes ranges from $47 to $295 
and the average price is $150 
per pair. Just like the other com
panies, Converse has generously 
agreed to give 5-15 percent of 
the net retail sales of these prod
ucts to the Global Fund.
Have you seen a common 
theme yet among these compa
nies? I assume that each company 
has benevolent intentions to help 
Africa, but based on the numbers 
and percentages, I cannot assume 
that helping Africa is all they are 
after. There is simply too much 
room for these companies to ben
efit financially. The result of 
this marketing campaign is that 
these American companies will 
increase their bottom line by 
selling products with a minimal 
percentage going to the Global 
Fund. For the $249 PRODUCT 
(RED) Nano, roughly 4 percent 
of the cost is actually going to 
the worthy cause. How can we 
as a society praise them for this 
practice? These companies are 
leveraging the buying power of 
Americans versus helping AIDS 
victims directly.
How can we as a society ac
cept this practice of tying a con
tinental tragedy into the manip
ulation of American consumers 
and their buying habits? What 
if every company partnered 
with a disease it wanted to fight 
against? Every viable item avail
able in the marketplace would 
be marked up with a dona
tion tax. A companys ability 
to donate to charities shouldnt 
hinge on Americans purchasing 
its products. And although this 
may be extreme, its not that far
fetched. The (RED) campaign 
plans to add several new com
panies to its list in the next year, 
and it has already signed with 
Myspace.com to start website 
advertising. If this campaign 
is successful, we can expect 
more of them in the future. The 
United States distinguishes itself 
among nations with its compas
sion and global aid. And other 
countries will take as much as 
they can when we are willing to 
foot the bill.

Hunt should be redesigned for the 21st-century student
Old aluminum box seems trapped in 1960s academia
Andrew Peters
Now that I have moved farther away from 
campus and the difficulty of my coursework is steadily increasing, I actively seek 
a place on campus where I can consistently 
do my work without interruption or incon
venience. Though a library would seem to 
be that place, this universitys main library 
is ill-equipped to handle the ever-changing 
needs of a 21st-century student.
All Hunt Library boasts are stacks upon 
stacks of unused books, and while I think 
it is necessary that the library has many 
volumes, they take up massive amounts of 
space and provide little or no utility to the 
majority of library users. The University of 
Pittsburghs Hillman Library has invested 
in moving bookcases that make books 
available, but pack them tightly enough 
that they arent taking up precious space. 
This is creative, but its certainly not new 
technology. Libraries have been doing this 
for years as they realize that the needs of 
library users are changing. For both Hunt 
and the Carnegie Mellon campus at large, 
effective use of space is crucial, seeing that 
room for expansion is virtually nil.
In our library, technology has come as 
an afterthought. The cluster  albeit won
derfully equipped  is tucked away, the 
music is shoved into a back corner, and 
the lone instructional center is merely 
carved out of the existing book space, 
with flimsy panels and open bookcases 
for walls. Power outlets are few and far 
between, limiting the number of places 
where students can use laptops for ex
tended periods of time. The old style of re
search that this building was constructed 
to facilitate is gone now, and newer styles 
- of learning are restricted to dusty corners.
Hunt must be redesigned to facilitate 
many different kinds of work  both col
laborative and individual. Right now, it 
is merely a series of hallways with tables. 
Sure, you can do group work there, but 
the first two floors are often prohibitively 
noisy, and wherever you are, there will be 
a maximum of two outlets, so only two 
in your group can use laptops, unless of 
course you remembered to bring a handy 
power strip with you. If you want to write 
something down or sketch out group ideas, 
hopefully you brought your own white
board, because even the lone conference 
room in the basement doesnt provide a 
space conducive to brainstorming or plan
ning, let alone the other spaces. The best 
place to work is a tiny table shoved in the 
back of the basement, jammed between 
the 1889 edition of Zeitschrift Des Verien 
Deutsche Ingenieure and a pile of unused 
paper boxes. Those who have used the 
space know that other students eager for 
a good space to work trek into the depths 
of the basement only to leave disappointed 
that you found their secret space first.
If you like to work silently, hopefully 
you enjoy uncomfortable study carrels and 
dont enjoy using your laptop. For the 124 
study carrels in the quiet study areas of the 
third floor, there are only 26 outlets. Not 
only is this woefully inadequate for mod
ern study, its also hazardous, as the out
lets are spaced such that students have to 
walk over and around cords so they dont 
fall and hurt themselves  or worse yet, 
hurt a laptop. I know that glossy, inane col
lege guides makes it seem to prospective 
students like there is some sort of contest 
among universities to see who can accrue 
the most volumes, but perhaps they should
consider listing the outlet-to-desk ratio, a 
stat that is vastly more relevant and says 
volumes more about the state of library 
resources.
Certainly in a modern library, some 
spaces can afford to be noisy (the Maggie 
Murph Caf, for instance), but there must 
be space for groups and individuals to work 
in an environment that is both quiet and 
comfortable. Why cant space be set aside 
for a series of conference rooms, meet
ing rooms, classrooms, lounges with 
walls that are soundproof to ensure an 
environment that maximizes productivity, 
but movable to create a dynamic, multi
functional space? Think setting aside so 
much room for defined spaces is absurd? 
Consider Mack Scogins law library on 
the campus of Arizona State University. 
Scogin, the man who is currently designing 
the Gates Center, put up a library on the 
ASU campus that features three computer 
clusters and 27 meeting and study rooms. 
Though the student population of ASU is 
much larger than Carnegie Mellons, the 
law school library serves only about 600 
full-time students. That is an environment 
that is conducive to learning.
Even Hunts hours of operation are 
symptomatic of old-school thinking. I 
congratulate the library for being open 
until 3 a.m. on weekdays, but its hours on 
weekends are not logical. The library does 
not open until noon and closes at nine. 
I have seen dozens of students rattle the 
locked doors of Hunt early on a Saturday 
or Sunday, wanting to get their work done 
early in the day. I dont know the logic be
hind the hours  can they not afford staff? 
Are they suggesting that certain times are 
unfit for study? I still have no idea, though 
I have asked on occasion. This university 
cant load us down with mountains of 
group and individual work and then not
give a place that is open, comfortable, 
and conducive to getting that work done.
Happily, Hunt is not complexly laid out 
 it is a big aluminum box that, as we 
have seen with the Maggie Murph Caf, 
lends itself quite successfully to renova
tion. Now, I am not foolish enough to 
believe the changes I suggest are free. Of 
course, they could cost as much as a few 
million dollars. But if a concerted effort 
were made in planning the budget and 
looking for outside donors, in much the 
same way as Purnell or the University 
Center were built, I believe the money 
could be raised within several years. If 
money cannot be found anywhere, the 
administration might think of at least ask
ing students how they feel about library 
resources so that if a funding opportunity 
opens up, the administration will at least 
know what to kind of facility to shoot for. 
I dont expect immediate action (anyone 
at Carnegie Mellon who does is either 
dreaming or visiting), but I do expect a 
concerted effort.
In the meantime, I open this challenge 
to all student and faculty architects and 
designers: Fix Hunt Library. Show us 
what an innovative, 21st-century library 
looks like. Tear down walls, move books, 
put in wiring, rip out ceilings, and make 
the library the center of campus aca
demic life. Maybe your designs will never 
be fully realized, but no one will ever 
be moved to action if students merely 
grumble quietly or walk away frustrated 
when they have no to adequate space to 
got work done.
But whatever you do, leave Maggie 
Murph alone  I love those cookies.

Keeping our 
college green 
and sustainable
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Wed like to highlight our new 
sustainability task force and so
licit your web developing skills.
Green practices and focus on 
sustainability are central val
ues to this university. Carnegie 
Mellon University is a national 
pioneer in all things green. But 
we can do more. Its great to have 
dorms and office buildings that 
are environmentally friendly, but 
we have to reflect upon how we 
have incorporated our green val
ues into our daily lives.
In our quest to create a more 
sustainable university, weve 
overlooked the low-hanging fruit: 
how each university entity runs 
its daily business practices. Are 
all our printers on PowerSaver 
mode? Are we ordering from 
green suppliers? Do we have a 
well-implemented recycling pro
gram? These are just some of 
the questions a sustainability task 
force would ask. Students would 
make up the task force, which 
would serve as a consulting firm 
to the entire university. The stu
dents will meet with department 
heads and business managers of 
various departments and organi
zational entities on campus.
Theyll discuss business pro
cesses and supplier logistics, all 
with an eye to sustainability im
provements. The task force will 
not be an advocacy body. It will 
not exist to spread awareness 
about the green lifestyle. It will 
exist to focus on the financial 
concerns of this university, mak
ing sure our dollars are being well 
spent, considering the universi
tys values. The task force will 
be charged with offering recom
mendations, not condemnation.
If youre interested in serving 
on the task force, or helping us 
craft its mission statement and 
bylaws, please contact us. It will 
be composed of passionate, business-oriented students who want 
to cause positive change. You 
should be one of them.
Finally, were in the market for 
an executive assistant. More spe
cifically, a web developer who 
can help us get several projects 
off the ground this year. One of 
the largest initiatives wed like to 
take on this year is the creation of 
a Carnegie Mellon CampusWiki 
 a Wikipedia of campus knowl
edge. The potential for such a 
website is enormous. We want a 
determined student to help make 
it happen.
An ideal applicant would be 
a self-starter; we dont like to 
micro-manage. He or she should 
have excellent communica
tions skills and be well-versed 
in HTML, PHP, XML, and other 
common Internet technologies. 
Experience in WeblSO integra
tion would be ideal, although not 
required. Open-source platforms 
or wiki experience is a huge plus. 
This is a paid position. If inter
ested, please contact us ASAP.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 6, 2006
Basketball team plays at 
Pitt in an exhibition game
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team went up against 
fifth-ranked Division I University, 
of Pittsburgh last Wednesday at 
the Petersen Events Center. The 
hosting Panthers won the exhi
bition game 103-45.
The Tartans returned only 
four players who averaged more 
than 10 minutes of play per game 
from last year, and Carnegie 
Mellons inexperience showed 
against thePanthers. Pittsburgh 
jumped out to an early 21-2 lead 
before junior guard Geoff Kozak 
was able to score on a lay-up for 
the Tartans first field goal at the 
12:05 mark.
Pittsburgh, led by preseason 
Big East Player of the Year center 
Aaron Gray, a 7'0" senior, used 
its size advantage to control the 
paint and the rebound depart
ment throughout the night. On 
offense Pitt was able to pass well 
and work for an open shot, while 
defensively they stayed right on 
Carnegie Mellon, making the 
Tartans earn every shot they 
made.
The Panthers took a 48-17 
lead into halftime, holding 
Carnegie Mellon to 13.9 percent 
shooting in the first half.
Pitt certainly was as good as 
we thought they were going to 
be, Carnegie Mellon head coach 
Tony Wingen said. They played 
every bit as well as their rank
ing. We knew it was a tall order 
for us to come in here and com
pete with them. Tonights game 
and every day in practice for this 
team is a learning experience. 
Were very young right now, 
were inexperienced, and every 
day were trying to get better, 
and I think tonights game was in 
that vein. We learned a lot about 
ourselves here tonight.
The Tartans calmed down and 
shot the ball better in the second
half thanks in part to sophomore 
forward Ryan Einwag and Ko
zak each connecting on a pair 
of three-pointers. Einwag led 
the Tartans with 13 points, and 
Kozak contributed 12 points for 
the game.
Senior co-captain guard Brad 
Matta added 10 points and six 
rebounds, and sophomore point 
guard Corey ORourke led the 
team with three assists and two 
steals on the night.
I think we gained confi
dence as the game went along, 
Wingen said. We got over the 
jitters, after a time and we didnt 
shoot the ball well all night long, 
but in spurts we shot it better in 
the second half. We executed 
our offense pretty well at times 
in the second half, so well look 
at those things on tape and re
inforce them and try and make 
them more consistent.
Despite the lopsided score, the 
team took something from the 
game. The next 24 games we 
can always look back, when we 
are in a slump, or up against ad
versity, and we can basically say 
we went against the University 
of Pittsburgh, a top-five team in 
the country, Matta said. We 
fought hard and we did the best 
we could, and we came out with 
some positive outcomes.
The game was a learning ex
perience for the Tartans, who 
are coming off a memorable 
2005-06 season in which they 
won their first-ever University 
Athletic Association title en 
route to posting a 20-5 regular 
season record. Carnegie Mellon 
defeated Princeton 51-46, and 
played in the Division III post
season tournament last year, 
losing to Baldwin-Wallace in the 
first round.
The Tartans open up their reg
ular season on Friday, November 
17, when they travel to Washing
ton & Jefferson University for a 
10 p.m. tipoff in the annual West 
Penn Classic.
Soccer wins game by two
Senior midfielder Ashley McMakin (#8) takes on three Emory players 
during Sundays home game.
SOCCER, from A14
Megan [Hughes] in the back, and 
our two central midfielders Ash
ley [McMakin] and Lisa [Pascoli] 
are seniors so they went out and 
played this game like it could be 
their last, stayed composed, and 
played together.
We were inspired by our se
niors going out, junior forward/ 
midfielder Jessica Howard said. 
There was a lot of motivation 
just coming from playing for 
them. We came out strong be
cause of that and because of our 
last game and the fact that weve 
only beat Emory twice in the last 
14 years.
Emorys aggressive play 
brought them back into the game 
in the second half. They con
trolled the half from the kickoff 
and netted goals in the 53rd and 
64th minutes to cut the Tartan 
lead to one.
Emory came out and they 
played incredibly hard, Wil
lard said. This was their last 
game of the season. We got a 
little flustered and werent play
ing the way we should play. We 
were just making mistakes that 
you make if youre under pres
sure and youre not composed, 
and they really took it to us. A lot 
of credit is due to them. We also 
needed to take a little bit of re
sponsibility and stay composed 
when things were coming down 
to our end, which we didnt do a 
very good job at.
The Tartans had very few of
fensive attacks in the second 
half, but the tandem of How
ard and sophomore midfielder 
Mary Ashe produced Carnegie 
Mellons fourth goal. In the 84th 
minute, Howard received a lead 
pass from Ashe on the right side 
i
of the field, just outside the 18- 
yard box, and Howard dribbled 
and took a shot that deflected off 
Emorys goalie and slowly trick
led into the net.
Jess Howards goal was huge, 
Willard said. For basically the 
entire 45 minutes .of the second 
half, I really wasnt comfortable 
even with a three-goal lead. 
Soccers a funny game and two 
halves can be completely differ
ent, which was the case today. 
Jesss goal was very key because, 
in my mind, they had very good 
chances to tie the game; Sarah 
DeWath cleared a ball off the 
line [in the 51st minute] which 
could have made the score 3-3 
after all was said and done. 
When Jess put that ball in it took 
some of the pressure off us, and 
we started playing a little more 
composed and took some of the 
momentum away from Emory. 
Being up 4-2 instead of 
3-2  its only one goal, but ev
eryone was able to relax a little 
bit, Howard sstid. Everyone 
kind of picked it up and knew we 
were going to win this game. 
The season as a whole has 
been a roller coaster, said Wil
lard. We were a young team at 
the start and its taken us a long 
time to find our way as a team, 
and the last few games weve 
been playing like the coaching 
staff knew we could play. Its 
great for these kids whove been 
working very hard to come out 
and end the season playing the 
way they know they can play. 
The Tartans end the regular 
season with a record of 8-7-1 
and 3-4 in the UAA.
They will find out today if they 
earn a bid to the Eastern College 
Athletic Conference tourna
ment.

Anna Kochalko took fourth in 
) the 200-yard butterfly (2:13.08).
In the sprint events its always 
hard to predict who the winners 
will be. It usually comes down to 
the touch at the wall, Connell 
said. The 50 or 100 could be de
termined by nothing more than a 
good or bad start, and races can 
be as close as a hundreth of a 
second. I personally had a pretty 
disappointing finish in the 50; 
only a fifth of a second separated 
second through fourth places.
The womens' 200-yard free
style relay A team of senior 
captain Jenny Sieger, first-year 
Sara' Andrews, junior Amy 
Pischke, and Connell took third 
with a time of 1:41.86. Con

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 6, 2006
SPORTS COMMENTARY
Penguins SteeVing the spotlight
Doug Fricker
One is the reigning Su
per Bowl champion and the 
other had the second-worst 
record in the National Hockey 
League (NHL) last season. Yet 
you wouldnt know it from the 
way the Pittsburgh Steelers 
and Penguins are playing at 
this point in their respective 
seasons. The Steelers are cur
rently 2-6, while the Penguins 
are 7-4 and in second place in 
the Atlantic Division  only 
one point behind the New Jer
sey Devils. Bad execution and 
poor management decisions 
have hurt the Steelers, while 
an influx of bright young stars 
is making the Penguins one 
of the most exciting teams to 
watch in the NHL.
The Steelers look like a com
pletely different team now 
from last February, finding 
new ways to lose each week. 
The proverbial finger can be 
pointed at almost everyone af
filiated with the team after the 
Steelers managed to lose close 
games against the Cincin
nati Bengals, Atlanta Falcons, 
and Oakland Raiders. All 
three losses were games they 
arguably should have won. 
The Steelers dominated the 
Falcons and the Raiders on pa
per, but shot themselves in the 
foot with costly turnovers and 
penalties, two things unchar
acteristic of teams coached by 
Bill Cowher.
Two big drop-offs from last 
season have occurred in the 
areas of special teams and the 
offensive line. The Steelers 
did not re-sign wide receiver/ 
kickoff and punt returner Antwaan Randle El this off-season, and to compound mat
ters, they didnt go out and get 
a proven replacement for him. 
This has come back to. haunt 
them, especially in their losses 
to Cincinnati and Atlanta. The 
offensive line hasnt been as 
dependable as last season, and 
Pro Bowl center Jeff Hartings 
is currently injured, causing 
the running game to struggle 
and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to lose protection, 
which leads to more sacks and 
more turnovers.
Injuries have taken a toll on 
the Steelers, but the bottom 
line is that the team lacks the 
confidence needed for it to suc
ceed. Everything that Roethlisberger has gone through in 
the past few months has added 
to the current situation.
First, he suffered a concus
sion in a motorcycle accident 
that left him with a surgically 
repaired face in June. Some
how he managed to recover 
quickly and fully from that, 
but then came his emergency 
appendectomy that kept him 
out of the season opener and 
another concussion in the loss 
to Atlanta.
Last years Super Bowl 
champions were able to win 
with their balanced offense 
and dominating defense. 
Once they had a lead, they 
would run the ball to eat up 
the clock and seal the victory. 
Last years team had discipline 
and determination, while this 
years team is having trouble 
focusing for four quarters, not 
to mention a full 16-game sea
son.
But check it out sports 
fans, there is a team in Pitts
burgh playing well this fall, 
and theyre exciting to watch, 
too. Filled with youth, the 
Pittsburgh Penguins have ex
ploded out of the gate behind 
the great play of center Sidney 
Crosby and forward/center 
Evgeni Malkin.
Become familiar with these 
names if you arent already, 
because theyre the real deal. 
Last year, rookie Sidney 
Crosby became, at age 19, the 
youngest player ever with a 
100-point season. Hes as good 
as advertised and is the future 
of the Penguins franchise. 
Add in Malkin, a 20-year-old 
rookie from Russia who is 
playing alongside Crosby on 
the Penguins first line, and
youve got one of the youngest 
and most talented tandems in 
hockey. Malkin became the 
first player since the 1917-18 
season to begin his NHL ca
reer with goals in each of his 
first six games.
Lets not forget Jordan 
Staal, whos only 18 years old 
and the teams number-one 
draft pick from the June 2006 
draft. Staal made the team 
out of training camp and has 
contributed right away. His 
first three NHL goals were 
all shorthanded, and he has 
moved up to the teams second 
line because of his strong play. 
Marc-Andre Fleury, the Pen
guins 21-year-old goaltender, 
is blossoming into a star as 
well after struggling at times 
during his first two seasons.
The jury is still out on the 
Penguins, with the season 
just over 10 percent complete. 
They have the offensive fire
power necessary for success, 
but theyve let in the most 
goals two seasons in a row 
and return virtually the same 
defenders. The playoffs are a 
definite possibility with this 
group, something that cant be 
so easily said about the Steel
ers.
If what has happened so 
far with the Steelers and the 
Penguins is any indication 
of whats to come, the city of 
Pittsburgh isnt going to know 
how to react. I can think of only 
one more thing that could add 
to this unexpectedness, but 
the Pirates winning the World 
Series next year is completely 
out of the question... or is it?

balls thrown around, you have 
the opportunity to make a play. 
Thankfully I was able to make 
them when they were there. But 
our line [and] our underneath 
coverage was great. That frees us 
up to do our job. We didnt even 
have to worry about the run as a 
defensive backfield because we 
knew that the front five would 
take care of it.
Scoring touchdowns on their 
first four possessions, the Tar
tans, who last week won their 
first UAA championship since 
1997, built a 28-0 lead late in 
the second quarter. After junior 
Colby Whitman put the finish
ing touch on a 10-play, 62-yard 
opening drive with a three-yard 
touchdown run, Sivek capped 
each of the next three drives with 
short rushing scores of his own.

couple of really good receivers  
and the quarterback threw a re
ally good ball. We knew that an 
offense that throws it that much 
is bound to make some plays. 
It was just important for us to 
limit those big plays, and when 
the time came, people made the 
stops when we had to.

first half to send Carnegie Mellon 
into halftime with a 35-0 lead.
Carnegie Mellons offensive 
output surfaced, in part, thanks 
to a defense that stepped up 
nearly every time Bethany threat
ened to crack the scoreboard.
Despite giving up 232 yards 
through the air, Carnegie Mel
lons defense managed to keep 
the Bison scoreless through 
three-plus quarters. Before Lewis 
personally ended one Bethany 
drive with his fourth intercep
tion of the season, the defense 
stifled the Bison on consecutive 
fourth-down attempts inside

quarter.

60-yard drive culminated not 
only with the Tartans pushing 
their lead to 42-0, but Siveks 
two-yard touchdown romp that 
propelled him over the 1000- 
yard plateau. Siveks fourth score 
on the day also gave Carnegie 
Mellon its fifth touchdown in six 
possessions.
We think we have a very 
strong running attack. We had 
success with it early, Lackner 
said about a ground game that 
not only included 139 yards on 
23 carries from Sivek, but com
piled 254 rushing yards. Now 
[Bethany] throws the ball well, 
and we felt that driving the foot
ball and running time off the 
clock leaves less time once we 
got ahead.
At the start of the second half, 
three consecutive three-andouts, followed by Lewis second 
interception as Bethany was ap
proaching the Tartan red zone, 
kept the Tartan defense in line 
for a third shutout on the sea
son. Early in the fourth quarter, 
however, Bethany senior quar
terback Matt Blumer hooked up 
with wide receiver Milton Joyner 
for a 27-yard touchdown pass to 
inch the Bison to a marginally 
better 42-6.
Although the shutout was lost, 
team-defense earned the unit a 
measure of redemption on the en
suing extra point attempt. Junior 
defensive lineman Michael Reg
gie blocked kicker Rob Mieles 
kick and Lewis recovered the 
football. Then, after charging up 
field for 10 yards, he pitched the 
ball to senior linebacker James 
Rogers, who dashed the remain
ing 68 yards for an electrifying, 
albeit superfluous, two points.
Its a very exciting play when 
youre up. It just shows that we 
never really quit, Lewis said.
Rogers two-point conversion 
finalized the lopsided contest 
as the 44-6 victory vaulted the 
Tartans to 9-0 on the season: 
the only record that concers the 
team.

Last weekend, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens volleyball 
team hosted the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
championships. The Tartans fin
ished fourth overall out of eight 
teams. Second-ranked Wash

with a narrow victory against 
the 13th-ranked Emory Univer
sity in the final round to win the 
tournament 3-0 (30-20, 31-29,

defeated the Tartans in the thirdplace match.

The Tartans carried momen

Although the Tartans en

fell short, losing to the Bears 
3-0 (30-23, 30-20, 30-16). The

the first two sets, but the Bears 
defense proved to be too much in 
the end. The Tartans lost to the 
Bears but placed second in their

On October 28, the Tartan 
football team won its first 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) title in nearly 10 years. 
The game against Washington 
University in St. Louis went 
into overtime, and was finally 
won by a 22-yard field goal by
senior kicker Nat Greenstein. 
Following the game, Greenstein 
.was named UAA Athlete of the 
Week. Last week, Greenstein 
met with The Tartan to talk 
about his success and the 
Tartans season.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing football? How did you 
end up as a kicker?
Greenstein: I started playing 
in high school to get girls. No, 
actually I was a soccer player, 
but I was on vacation and missed 
tryouts, so I ended up going out 
for the football team. I was a 
backup at a couple of other posi
tions, but really just stuck with 
kicking.
T: Did you always plan on 
playing football when you went 
to college?
G: I was not really sure, but 
then my high school team won 
states, and schools started look
ing at me, and I was getting 
recruited, and then I kind of de
cided it was something I wanted 
to do.
T: How do you handle Carn
egie Mellons academics com
bined with football?
G: I am a physics major, so I
really spend basically all of my 
free time working. It is pretty 
hard.
T: Any rituals or superstitions 
you have before a game?
G: I have to do the same 
stretching routine before every 
game, and I have to find the 
same people, and kind of spread 
out the same for stretches. Then 
we all stopped getting our hair 
cut building up to the UAA 
championship game. That gets 
pretty crazy; some of the guys 
ended up with really giant hair.
T: How do you focus and han
dle high-pressure situations like 
in the game in St. Louis?
G: I think of my roommate, 
Mulhurn, naked.
It is really hard, a lot of peo
ple come up to me and just tell 
me to relax, tell me that it is an 
easy kick, or that I will make it 
without any problems, but re
ally I just do not want to talk to 
people. I try to pretty much just 
stay to myself, kick into the net, 
' and try not to dwell on whether 
or not I can make it.
T: Any accomplishments that 
you are particularly proud of?
G: Well, I have had some
pretty good-looking dates, but 
I would definitely have to say 
winning the UAA was some
thing I am really proud of. Plus, 
it is my senior year, and every
thing just seemed to fall into 
place; it was really nice.
T: Whats your favorite place 
that you have gotten to travel to 
with the football team?
G: St. Louis was fun, but Chi
cago is always a good time. I do 
not think anyone has ever gone 
to Chicago and not had fun.
T: How do you relax at Carn
egie Mellon between football 
and school work?
G: Really I just hang out with 
my roommates, who I would 
like to shout out to. Mulhurn, 
Jon, Kevin, Annie, Lisa, and 
Kasey  they are really a lot of 
fun and help me relax.
T: What are the plans for 
the rest of the Carnegie Mellon 
football season?
G: Well we would like to keep 
a steady pace for our last couple 
of games, and then obviously 
do well in the playoffs. We head 
into the NCAA Division III play
offs, which are single elimina
tion, and really tough.

Yesterday, the mens soccer 
team took on Emory University 
at home in its last regular sea
son game, beating the Eagles 
2-0. The Tartans finished their 
regular season 11-5 and 4-3 in 
the University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA). The Eagles dropped 
to 11-6 for the season and 2-5 in 
the UAA.
Coming off a three-game los
ing streak, the Tartans battled 
the Eagles through a scoreless 
first half. Tartan sophomore 
goalkeeper Matthew Bazin and 
Eagles junior goalkeeper Keith 
Meehan each had two saves for 
the half.
Fifteen minutes into the sec
ond half, Carnegie Mellon fi
nally put a shot past Meehan to 
give the Tartans at 1-0 lead with 
30 minutes remaining. Firstyear midfielder Patrick Lutz fed 
the ball to senior midfielder Will 
Schlough, who turned and shot 
the ball through traffic from 18 
yards out. The shot was high, 
over Meehans fingertips, and 
settled in the upper corner of 
the net. The goal was Schloughs 
fifth for the season.
Ten minutes later the Tartans 
added an insurance goal, bring
ing the score to 2-0. Lutz brought 
the ball up the field, and crossed 
through three Emory defend
ers to senior Jonathan Browne. 
Brownes low shot, sliced into 
the right corner of the Eagles 
net, was Brownes seventh goal 
this season.
We had a couple of hard losses 
that could have gone either way, 
that we could have won, Browne 
said about the Tartans recent 
slump. Basically, the only thing 
different between this game and 
the others is that I told the guys 
we are playing for pride this 
time.
Emory stepped up its offense, 
matching the Tartans eight 
shots for the half, but was unable 
to put a shot past Bazin. Bazin 
had eight saves throughout the 
game. The team is tired down 
after 45 minutes, so you know, 
we just kept going. [Emory] 
seemed to get a little bit winded, 
and we took advantage of our 
chances, Browne said.
Even with a two-goal lead, 
Carnegie Mellon continued to 
pressure the Emory goal, tak
ing six shots during the last 20 
minutes of the game. Schloughs 
shot in the 76th minute went 
just wide and his header a min
ute later was saved by Meehan. 
Browne took the last shot of the 
game in the 85th minute of play, 
a low shot that ricocheted off the 
corner post; Brownes rebound 
was foiled by Meehan. Meehan 
had five saves throughout the 
game.
With the win, the Tartans end 
a turbulent regular season on a 
high note. This season has had 
a lot of ups and downs, Browne 
said. We definitely had the team 
to do it this year, to have a better 
record than we did, but, all in 
all, Im proud of everyone that 
played. Everyone showed that 
they had heart this season, espe
cially in this last game.

The Carnegie Mellon wom
ens soccer team wrapped up its 
regular season on a good note 
yesterday with a 4-2 victory over 
the visiting Emory University 
Eagles on senior day at Gesling 
Stadium. Sophomore forward 
Abby Coffin scored a hat trick, 
and junior midfielder/defender 
Amanda Rose broke the schools 
career assist record in the win.
The Tartans put together their 
best half of soccer this season 
in the first half against Emory. 
Carnegie Mellon jumped out to a 
3-0 lead in the first 20 minutes 
of the game, thanks largely to 
the feet and head of Coffin.
Coffins first goal came in the 
sixth minute, on a header off a 
cross from junior forward Kasey 
Stever. In the 16th minute, Ste-, 
ver assisted on Coffins second 
goal when she passed the ball 
back to Coffin, who then blasted 
a shot from 25 yards out into the 
net over the outstretched arms 
of the Eagles goalie. Roses cor
ner kick in the 19th minute set 
up Coffins third goal. Coffin ran 
toward the ball and powerfully 
headed Roses kick into the net 
to put Carnegie Mellon up 3-0.
In the first half we came out 
and we played together as a 
team, head coach Sue Willard 
said. We have four seniors on 
the team, Andrea [Maresca] and

record books, Sivek did not see 
his achievement as a personal 
mark.
I just would like to give a lot 
of credit to the other [running] 
backs and the offensive line, 
Sivek said, who, upon learning 
that he had reached the mile
stone, rushed over to thank his 
offensive linemen. Ive always 
known its such a team game 
 the greatest team game  and 
honestly, without them there is 
no way I would have gotten this 
record.
On defense, the day appeared 
to be a coronation for Lewis. The 
senior, who on October 26 was 
named one of 17 national finalists 
for the Draddy Award, an honor 
that recognizes exceptional ath
letic and academic achievement, 
snagged two interceptions, 
broke up two other passes, and 
did his best impression of an 
option quarterback during the 
days most exciting (despite the 
Tartans 36-point lead at the 
time) play: a 98-yard return of 
a blocked extra point. But he too 
spread the praise around.
Our defensive line had un
believable pressure the entire 
day, Lewis said. [Bethanys

Global health at Carnegie Mellon
International Festival celebrates wellness
Globalization has become a common term 
that refers to topics like economics and tech
nology, but now it is beginning to include the 
medical field as well. "Body, Mind, and Spirit: 
Prescriptions for Global Health," the theme of 
Carnegie Mellon's International Festival this 
year, was a way to introduce the public to cur

The three-day event, 
which ran from 
Thursday through 
Saturday in the 
University Center, fea

event opened with a

Fair, which provided 
Carnegie Mellon fac
ulty and staff with 
information on health 
and fitness options 
and benefits open to 
them through the uni
versity. Participants 
were also offered free
flu shots and the opportunity to donate blood to 
the American Red Cross.
Karin Arnds, a private practicing therapist 
and member of Carnegie Mellon's Student 
Counseling Center, led a workshop on autogenic 
training, a deep relaxation technique that uses 
the mind and body to heal the effects of stress. 
Participants of the workshop learned the theory 
behind autogenic training and some exercise 
techniques to help them achieve extreme relax
ation and inner peace.
The main attraction and keynote speaker was 
the founder of Doctors Without Borders in 
North America, Richard Heinzl. He began the 
organization in Canada in 1988, and it quickly 
spread to the U.S. Heinzl urged the crowd to get 
involved in community health problems, to look 
at the world outside their hometowns, and to 
make a commitment to helping others.

that it would be a 
major warning to the

about the condition 
of our planet. Its cre
ators predict world 
catastrophe in 10 
years if people avoid 
fixing the problems 
that humans have

however, comes across as neither negative nor 
preachy; it is really just a story about former 
Vice-President A1 Gores crusade to stop global 
warming. After his defeat in the 2000 election, 
Gore made a lifelong commitment to saving 
our planet. This film, released at this years 
Sundance Film Festival, presents Gore as the 
public has never seen him, rallying Americans 
to join him in this environmental battle.

The Carnegie Tech Mandolin Club had not been receiving 
the support it needed from its students. As is the tradition 
in these times, blame was placed solely on the first-years, 
or plebes, for not giving enough of their musical talents to 
the club. Good thing that attendance eventually did rise. - a 
school is only as good as its Mandolin Club, after all.
To raise funds for a trip to the newly created United Nations 
in New York, Techies held a shoe-shining fundraiser. 
Those volunteering in the event visited the fraternities and 
male residence halls looking for a few good men who 
needed a shine. Regardless of the profit made, there was 
a consensus that the fundraiser would help Techies keep 
their squeaky clean image.
Patty Powers expressed her disgust towards certain 
unwanted visitors in the Skibo dining hall. Recently, an 
abundance of flies had made their way into the cafeteria, 
increasing 4he number of cups of soup being sent back 
to the chef. Also on Powers list of problems was the 
constant smell of garbage and an obese dead rat found at 
the bottom of the stairs to. the dining establishment. At least 
the rat was enjoying the food.
A Tartan writer wanted to stick it to the man: Outraged by 
the recent swarm of business suits seen around campus, 
the columnist talked about his recent failure with the 
Business Opportunities Conference. Maybe it was his 
refusal to sell out to the system, or maybe ft was his major 
(philosophy). Regardless of what caused the poor writers 
bane, he was still proud that he refus[edj to cave in until he 
ha[d] a family to support.
A suspicious man was caught stealing clothes off a 
scarecrow on the fraternity quad. While the crime may 
appear idiotic, the man sure could cook up a quick story. 
When asked what he was doing, the thief stated that he 
was recovering a shirt that was stolen from him a year ago 
by the same people. Along with this, he also claimed that 
his name was imprinted in the clothes. Unfortunately, the 
police checked and found no such imprints. Maybe next 
time the poor man will just say the scarecrow gave him the 
clothes.
A shady-looking character was seen ambling through 
the University Center and then spotted again rifling 
through garbage cans outside of the Purnell Center. 
Police questioned the man and discovered that he was 
a Carnegie Mellon alumnus who had returned for the 
weekend to celebrate Homecoming. Perhaps his actions 
were a throwback to the days in which, like every college 
student, he would do anything for free food.

Disco hip-hop and a master whistler
Blackalicious and Andrew Bird to play Carnegie Mellon
Coming off a successful fall concert in 2005 with Talib Kweli 
and J-Live, AB Concerts signed Phantom Planet and The 
Secret Machines to co-headline its spring concert. But with 
a sudden strike of bad weather that forced a last-minute 
move into the Wiegand Gym, attendance was poor, and the 
universitys response lackluster. Add on a funding cut from 
the Carnegie Mellon administration, and all of a sudden, AB 
Concerts was stuck in a rut.
But things are looking up for AB Concerts and student 
life: This Friday night will be Carnegie Mellon's annual 
fall concert, and we are treated this year with rap group 
extraordinaire Blackalicious as the concert's headliner and 
singer-songwriter Andrew Bird as the opener. The mix of acts, 
although lacking in cohesion, will bring the hip-hop and the 
alt-rock/hipster crowds at Carnegie Mellon together for the 
first time in years.
Blackalicious, which hails from the Bay area, has five records 
to its name. And although often grouped together with 
more mainstream acts for which it has opened in the past 
(The Roots, Public Enemy), Blackalicious is more like The 
Perceptionists and Sole, a stripped-down mixture of funky 
drumming, earthy bass lines, and a sprinkle of keys as texture. 
The lyrics, too, are less mainstream; they tell stories and sing 
uplifting messages. Both are rare in todays hip-hop world.
Learning to [Citizen] Cope
D.C. phenom comes to Mr. Small's Theatre
in Tennessee, Texas, and Mississippi, the years during 
which he developed much of his musical style were spent 
in Washington, D.C. Spending his time in the heart of D.C.'s 
go-go scene allowed Cope to heavily incorporate go-go into 
his music.
"Go-go is D.C.'s homegrown funk, a conga-driven style 
where the slowed down beat is king," Cope explained on his 
website.
Another unique quirk of his style is his oddly-tuned guitar, 
a product of first learning how to play on a guitar that was 
missing the E-string and had the B string tuned to a B flat.
Shuffled around from one label to another, Cope started out 
by signing with Capitol Records and followed with stints at 
Dreamworks and Arista before finally settling with RCA.
Despite having songs licensed for commercials and movie 
soundtracks, youve probably never heard Citizen Cope on a 
mainstream radio station. Ascribing the lack of airplay to his 
integration of many genres, Cope decided to "take his music 
to the people. It sounds cliched, but Cope is serious about his 
focus on touring.
Spending over 16 months on the road can be arduous, at the 
very least. Out there for so long, it's a lonely existence, even 
when you're surrounded by people," Cope said. Youre away 
from the ones you love, and it can be unsettling.
However, despite being practically ignored by mainstream 
radio and charts, he's made an excellent impression on the
Citizen Cope, the pseudonym of frontman Clarence 
Greenwood and the name of his band, is currently on tour 
promoting his new album, Every Waking Moment. Lucky 
for us, his next stop is Mr. Smalls Theatre & Funhouse in 
Pittsburgh.
In case you missed his hit Sons Gonna Rise, distributed 
as one of iTunes' free singles, Citizen Cope is a guitarist, 
keyboardist, and DJ who seamlessly blends together the 
genres of folk, R&B, hip-hop, and rock. Now, as the fusion of 
genres is becoming more prevalent in mainstream culture, 
Citizen Copes cult following may grow into something bigger.
Music was something coming out of a radio or off a record, 
something that made me feel these things I couldnt explain.
It was magical to me, and I thought it was something you 
had to be ordained with," Cope wrote on his website (www. 
citizencope. com).
After the success of his second album, The Clarence 
Greenwood Recordings, and the appearance of "Sons Gonna 
Rise" in a Pontiac commercial, Cope, ordained or not, has 
been making quite a splash in the rock and R&B genres. His 
gift, according to his record label, is that "he takes snapshots 
of the world around him, and turns them into universal truths. 
He sets them to the simplest of melodies, and weds those in 
turn to the most soul-stirring grooves."
This gift didn't emerge during his elementary school trumpetplaying days, but was a little more evident when he, like 
every other rockstar wannabe, picked up the guitar during 
his teenage years. While much of his childhood was spent
On 2002's Blazing Arrow, Blackalicious boldly mixes neo-soul, 
afrobeat, and West Coast rap together. With special guests 
ranging from Ben Harper to Gil-Scott Heron to Cut Chemist, 
Blazing Arrow proved Blackalicious was  and still is  a 
musically ambitious group to be taken seriously.
On 2005's The Craft, Blackalicious makes a push into pop and 
even disco-influenced hip-hop. Chock full of synthesizers, 
clavinets, strings, and heavy reverb throughout, The Craft is 
no less impressive but more accessible than Blazing Arrow. 
And just when you think Blackalicious has abandoned its 
innovative roots, MC Gift of Gab raps, "Never let 'em hold 
you back from anything you want now / Life is but a ride, so 
find them treasures that are unfound," letting us.know that 
redefinition, and not monotony, is their driving force.
Equally stylized and fresh is Chicagoan Andrew Bird, 
who, although trained classically on violin, has gained 
unprecedented street cred from alternative music press all 
over the globe. After breaking off from his group, Andrew 
Birds Bowl of Fire, he immediately began generating buzz for 
his 2003 release, Weather Systems. Both a talented songwriter 
and master instrumentalist (... and whistler), Bird is equally 
lauded for his energetic and outrageous live performances. On 
Dark Matter," armed with an electric guitar, a glockenspiel, 
his whistling, and ever-contagious croon, Bird pounds his way
through sonic cacophony, and on "First Song, Bird plucks, 
bows, whistles, and sings through folk-y chords and eerie 
vocal melodies.
Friday night's show is sure to be a great one. With strong 
attendance and community support, it will put AB Concerts 
back on the map as a savvy part of AB, well connected to 
both the industry and the student body. And if were lucky, 
the concert could put Carnegie Mellon  and even the city 
of Pittsburgh  back on the map as a go-to city for popular 
touring artists.

Hold the phone, Stop the Clocks nresji|Paperhouse
Oasis greatest hits compilation is first-term Clinton-era good ~  3 radio statiilOn mix CDs
After six years of Best 
of Silverchair on the 
shelves, order in the 
universe will soon be 
restored.
There comes a time in most bands lives to release 
a greatest hits collection. It is a delicate decision 
requiring careful song selection and deliberate release 
timing. Such a compilation represents a milestone in 
the career of a musical group, and for most new bands, 
it is a reaffirmation of the legitimacy of past success and 
a pledge of future proliferation.
Some groups are sloppier and more impatient than 
others. When Best of 
Silverchair was released 
in 2000, Silverchair had 
recorded three albums 
in five years, with just 
36 tracks to its name.
The 21-track compilation 
represented almost 60 
percent of the groups 
entire library. For a band 
with such a an allegedly 
high ratio, I find myself at a 
loss to recall the last time I 
heard a Silverchair song on 
the radio or caught myself 
singing Silverchair in the 
shower. After six years of 
Best of Silverchair on the . ;
shelves, order in the universe will soon be restored.
On November 21, Oasis, one of the iconic bands of the 
'90s, will release Stop The Clocks, a hard-earned best-of 
compilation for a band with 12 years' experience, nearly 
three complete lineup changes, and seven platinum
rated albums (four of which are on the list of top 20 
fastest-selling records in the UK) under its belt.
Stop The Clocks is a unique collection because each 
track was chosen by the band members themselves 
' not the management or the record company. While 
this ultimately gives the compilation a more organic 
feel, it means you might not find many songs from the 
band's biggest albums.
The Beatles be damned: Oasis 1997 release Be Here 
Now sold 695,761 units in the first four days, earning 
the title of number-one fastest selling album in the 
UK (beating Coldplays 2005 release, X&Y, by nearly 
67 percent). It is the album that rocks the hardest and 
longest  and the only album not represented on Stop 
The Clocks.
It is also lamentable that only one song from 2002's 
Heathen Chemistry appears. For a compilation 
with tracks allegedly chosen for song value and not 
popularity, I would expect to see at least a couple of 
obscure songs; but alas, there are none. Stop The Clocks 
is a non-stop hit parade marching down Main Street 
with the mayor in a convertible and majorettes twirling 
batons. The Audubon Society asked for a float but was 
denied.
Fortunately, all has not been lost. There is an album, one 
album, that encapsulates the mid-'90s and the entirety 
of alternative rock, and Oasis recorded it in 1995. It is
(What's the story) Morning Glory? and is represented 
well on Stop The Clocks  with almost half of the tracks 
appearing  including the super-hit mega-triumvirate 
of "Wonderwall," "Don't Look Back in Anger," and 
"Champagne Supernova."
(What's the story) Morning Glory? is the definitive 
album of the '90s. "Wonderwall" is the definitive song, 
and it is up there next to Green Days "Good Riddance" 
as the first song learned after 
the purchase of an acoustic 
guitar. Radioheads Thom 
Yorke covered it (drunk). In 
"Writing to Reach You, Travis 
Fran Healy asks "What's a 
Wonderwall, anyway?" Eleven 
years later, I still do not know, 
but I use "Wonderwall to 
serenade women  I hope it 
means something good.
The 18-song track list of Stop 
The Clocks reads more like a 
coming-of-age story than a 
singles collection. It documents 
Oasis history of hits  from 
the young, confident sound 
of the 1994 debut through the super-stardom of 1995 
(conveniently skipping over 1997s excesses of fame), 
adjustment to a new musical scene in 2000, good oldfashioned rocking out in 2002, and finally, maturation 
and retrospection in 2006.
Stop The Clocks draws most heavily from the songs of 
Oasis in their first-term Clinton-era prime. Music from 
the Lewinsky-scandal second-term has been kind of 
brushed under the rug, and that's all right. For a band 
symbolizing the youth, energy, and optimism of th 
'90s, it is only appropriate that its first two albums be 
featured most heavily at the expense of its lesser-known 
releases.
But, all Oasis is good Oasis.

Almost everyone i know has made a mix CD for someone else. What 
a lot of people arent aware of is that the art of the mix CD is held in 
very high regard by certain musicians and record labels that continue 
to produce meticulously crafted mixes that are as successful as 
albums of entirely original material.
Germanys Kompakt label, for example, has released many mix CDs 
to complement its selection of minimal techno and house music. 
Artists such as Superpitcher and Michael Mayer have released 
seminal mixes that are now regarded as milestones in the mix CD 
genre. Mayers Immer, released in 2002, is known as the album 
that gave birth to the minimal house genre by compiling a series of 
innovative tracks by different artists and emphasizing the fact that 
they all had something in common.
Coldcut, founder of the Ninja Tune label, is also responsible for an 
excellent release that is part of the Journeys by DJ series of mix CDs. 
What makes Coldcuts mix interesting and different from Mayers is 
the way it jumps from genre to genre. It reminds us that mix CDs can 
often give us a richer experience than any single artist could ever 
provide within the context of a single album. Coldcut exploits this 
notion by cutting back and forth from ambient to spoken word, from 
reggae to drum and bass, layering multiple tracks on top of each 
other and seamlessly transitioning from track to track, truly living up 
to the idea of the mix CD as a journey.
Studio IK7 also produces a well-known compilation series called DJ 
Kicks; Erlend Oyes interesting compilation stands out. Oye, who 
calls himself the singing DJ, removes vocal tracks from songs 
and replaces them with himself singing. A haunting composition is 
created when, on the albums second half, Oye combines a minimal 
Royksopp remix with the vocals from 'There Is a Light That Never 
Goes Out by The Smiths. A wholly new composition is created, 
one that is at once more personal than a simple mashup and exists 
powerfully not only on its own but also as part of an album.
Mix CDs provide artists with the power to make more exciting 
statements than they may otherwise be capable of on their own.
They provide a medium for the exchange of ideas through the 
assimilation of familiar and unfamiliar material together into a new 
whole.

Pittsburgh
Trader Joes employees also make the store unique, adding 
some personality to the grocery shopping experience. Clad in 
their trademark Hawaiian shirts, they show a genuine interest 
in both their work and in Trader Joes products. For instance, 
upon seeing that I was purchasing blueberry raspberry oat 
bran muffins, my cashier candidly explained their merits (they 
are amazing when lightly toasted and served with butter) and 
downsides (they are too large, so you need to cut them in half) 
to me.
While Trader Joes does many things well, it is lacking 
in several areas. The store itself is much smaller than 
Giant Eagle or Whole Foods, and it consequently offers 
comparativelyjimited quantities of goods. Trader Joe's has 
a large selection of reasonably priced Vitamins and dietary 
supplements as well as a well-stocked floral department, but 
only a scant selection of cleaning or health and beauty items, 
which makes it less convenient than the typical.grocery store. 
Additionally, the produce section is anemic  both Giant 
Eagle'and Whole Foods provide a much more robust selection 
of fresh fruits and vegetables.
With these few downsides, the store can still satisfy everyone 
from cost-conscious shoppers to gourmands. Its large, eclectic 
variety gives you plenty of options and its low prices allow 
for affordable food experimentation. The long checkout lines 
during opening weekend will certainly die down, but even if 
they do not, Trader Joe's is well worth the wait.
Trader Joe's is located at 6343 Penn Avenue in East Liberty 
and is easily accessible by the 71C. It is open seven days a 
week from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Kevin LaBuz | Staffwriter
The gourmet grocers come to
Trader Joes makes food experimentation affordable
I am not a patient person. Indeed, there are few things I 
dislike more than having to wait for something; yet it was 
with great pleasure that I waited in a checkout line for 30 
minutes during the grand opening of Trader Joe's Pittsburgh 
store on October 27. The reason for my pleasure is simple: For 
a college student with a tight budget, a penchant for good 
food, and a taste for adventure, Trader Joes fits the bill.
It is hard to succinctly describe Trader Joe's. Certainly it is 
a grocery store, but Giant Eagle is also a grocery store and 
it would not be fair to equate the two. Trader Joe's can be 
described as a specialty foods store, or a natural foods store, 
or a health foods store, and all the descriptions are apt but 
incomplete. With products like gorgonzola walnut ravioli, 
burgundy pepper seasoned leg of lamb, and peppadew chevre 
commonplace, it would be easy to call Trader Joes a gourmet 
food store. Yet their selection of staples such as milk, bread, 
and butter, combined with their low prices, prevents such an 
association. Trader Joes makes it easy to eat healthy with 
products like soy and flaxseed tortilla chips, which contain 
six grams of protein and four grams of fiber per serving, and 
goji berry trail mix, yet you can just as easily indulge in more 
sinful items like chocolate gelato or French brie.
The store offers an impressive and exciting array of products 
ranging from basic to gourmet and domestic to international. 
Most of these products are packaged under Trader Joe's 
private label and are unique to the chain. "I am really looking 
forward to trying out all of the private-label stuff, said Leah 
Franczyk, a Greenfield resident who was at Trader Joes on 
October 28. Its healthy and reasonably priced; you cant beat 
that.
Her sentiment was mirrored by Kevin Platukis, a junior at 
the University of Pittsburgh. They have a lot of interesting 
products. Im looking forward to taking full advantage of 
everything they have to offer when the grand opening rush 
dies down, Platukis said. That is, if it 
ever dies down," he said.
Perhaps more impressive than the foods are the prices. At 
Trader Joes, most items are priced below what you would 
find at Giant Eagle or Whole Foods. Expecting to have well 
over $50 of groceries in my cart, I was pleasantly surprised to 
find that the bill totaled less than $35. For instance, Kashi Go 
Lean cereal goes for $2.49 at Trader Joe's but $3.79 at Giant 
Eagle; a gallon of skim milk, $279 at Trader Joe's, costs $3.79 
at Giant Eagle.
Just as it is hard to describe Trader Joe's, it is also difficult 
to describe the stores typical customer; the clientele are as 
diverse as the food selection. On opening weekend, many 
shoppers were college students or young professionals, but 
there were also many parents shopping with children, as-well 
as sizable group of senior citizens.
Though Trader Joes opened its first Pittsburgh store last 
weekend, it has been around since 1958. The brand began 
as a small chain of convenience stores called Pronto Markets 
in the Los Angeles area. However, the company's founder,
Joe Coulombe, quickly realized that the chain could not 
compete with 7-Eleven. He also realized that Americans were 
increasingly traveling abroad and returning home with new, 
unique tastes that could not be easily satisfied at the grocery 
store. The first Trader Joes was opened in 1967 to cater to 
these changing tastes.
The chain is most densely concentrated in southern 
California, but it also has a strong presence in the Northeast. 
Recently, it has rapidly begun expanding outside of its core 
markets into locations in the South and Midwest. Aside from 
Pittsburgh, Trader Joe.s recently opened stores in the Atlanta 
metropolitan area, as well as in Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C., 
and Madison, Wis. In total, there are over 250 stores located in 
20 states.
Each store is tailored to its environment. The Pittsburgh store 
boasts a large.painted mural of the downtown skyline in the 
rear of the store, and large replicas of three bridges 
that connect Downtown with the North

All the Webs a stage, and a drama grad merely a player
A web-based series might be just the thing to send Eryn Joslyn into stardom
Eryn Joslyn, a 2006 drama alum, has landed her first big gig. Her 
name and that of the show she'll appear in may soon become 
familiar among the 12-to-30-year-old crowd. Joslyn's face isnt 
going to show up on the silver screen, though; shell be popping 
up on monitors across the country. MTV has announced the 
development of several programs that will be aired online only; 
Joslyn will star in Chloe. The show is the only scripted drama 
that MTV is releasing as part of this effort, and it will be aired in 
very short segments (as short as one minute) starting in January 
2007.
MTV is making the burgeoning field of webcasting even more 
innovative with its short-form episodes, said Joslyn, some of 
which are cut off in the middle of scenes. Theyre on the cutting 
edge ... trying to always evolve, and this is just a part of that 
evolution, she said. Just a few months after Joslyn moved to Los 
Angeles to look for work, she found herself on a plane back to the 
city of her alma mater  unconventionally, the show was filmed 
Pittsburgh. Moving to L.A. was a tough transition, said Joslyn, 
who was happy to return to the 'Burgh, if only temporarily: "It 
meant more to me than I could have imagined it would. 
*There are 26 episodes of Chloe, which follow the life of a 
Camegie.Mellon graduate working in web design. Joslyn plays 
Chloe, while the other cast members play her host of friends and 
colleagues. Charlie Murphy, a current sophomore in drama, is 
another cast member.
"Im glad to be doing something that is unpredictable," Joslyn 
said of the shows potential success, "but its also a little scary 
because you dont know what the outcome's going to be." 
Webcasting can be used to describe everything from a series of 
amateur videos of your kid's soccer games to highlights of CNNs 
nightly news broadcast. Any series of Internet audio or visual 
content is a webcast.
Justin Kownacki, writer and producer of the web series 
Something to be Desired, has been webcasting for four years 
but just recently found new ways to increase viewers, thanks to 
the growing numbers of web series online. Kownacki mentioned 
the website network2.tv, created by Jeff Pulver, a pioneer of 
voice-over-Intemet-protocol technology. The network2 site is an 
aggregate for web series, said Kownacki.
Kownacki also spoke about how the success of web-based 
programming has influenced online and television companies.
He mentioned that some websites, such as Yahoo!, employ 
talent agencies now and that news companies like CNN are 
looking to empower journalists to take cameras to the streets."
He added that producing web content is very inexpensive, citing 
AIiveinBaghdad.orgas an example. The site was started by one 
man, Brian Conley, who simply bought a few video cameras and 
handed them out to Iraqi citizens so they could record everyday 
life during the war.
Nodding to the short episodes of the MTV web series Chloe, 
Kownacki noted that people are looking for quick amusement. He 
said that viewers are now less discriminating about where their 
content comes from, as long as it is good content.
A downside to webcasting, Kownacki said, can be the lack of 
money in it, though having the support of a major network could 
change that in the future. There isn't a lot of profit made; most . 
people are doing it as a side gig," he said. Kownacki, however, is 
cunently working on getting episodes of Something to be Desired 
available on TLVo, which could mean an increase in viewers and 
revenue. Kownacki added that now some very popular web series 
bring in about 300,000 viewers, numbers near what a show on the 
Sci-Fi Channel would expect.
Drama professor Don Wadsworth knew Joslyn would go far in 
her career based on her talent and her humor. "Eryn is a very 
attractive girl; shes also very, very funny, and thats the best 
combination in a contemporary world," he said. Shell find a
much more unique way of delivering [a script] than most actors 
will."
Each year the School of Drama offers two showcases, Wadsworth 
said, and about 90 percent of students who participate end up 
signing with agents or landing a job. Joslyn was no different; she 
signed with a management company in L.A. and landed the lead 
role in Chloe after just three months on the west coast.
Joslyn saw some differences in acting for the tiny screen. The 
director allowed for a lot of improvising that, Joslyn said, would 
not always be the norm in film or television. She added that 
despite the show's format, the writing and character development 
are extremely strong.
Ultimately, Wadsworth believes the way acting is taught will not 
change. "When we talk about the difference between stage and 
film their basic charge is to leam how to act, period," he said. He 
expects the biggest change that web series or webcasting will 
bring will be the opinion of actors who have roles on the web. 
"Eventually, I dont think anyone will look down on [it]. It will just 
be work.
When Joslyn talks about finding work as an actress, she notes 
that while being on a set is great, returning to her part-time job 
at a yogurt shop in L.A. can be a little discouraging. If anything, 
thats what's hard about it," she said. "Once I get the career 
going, who knows. You never know whats going to happen."
For those interested in learning more about audio and video 
production for the web, Pittsburgh Filmmakers and the Three 
Rivers Film Festival are hosting PodCamp Pittsburgh. The free 
networking and learning event will be held at the Filmmakers' 
Melwood location irom 9 a.m. to 5p.m. on Saturday. Details at

NO MOVIE
Wednesday, November 8
Just going to forewarn you: If youre 
going to see the movie on Thursday, 
fill up today but dont eat tomorrow.
Ichi The Killer
Thursday, November 9 
7:30 10 12:30
Director Takashi Miike must have 
decided that Audition, his last 
film (among the most depraved 
films this reviewer has ever seen) 
was too kid-friendly. That would 
explain Ichi The Killer. Billed as the 
most violent movie ever, this one 
has bits and pieces of Yakuzas 
flying all over the screen for two 
hours. If you think you havent 
seen enough heads and limbs 
sliced off, this might be the perfect 
Thursday night diversion. Go: The 
critical community seems to think 
that ultra violent doesnt quite 
encompass the scope of this movie. 
That alone makes me curious. No 
go: May induce vomiting; dont 
wear nice clothes to this movie.
A Scanner Darkly
Friday, November 10 
8 10 12
This rotoscoped (means: real purdy 
animation) adaptation of Philip K. 
Dicks novel follows Keanu Reeves 
as an undercover narcotics agent 
trying to stop a drug epidemic.
I guess everyone needs a break 
from exchanging letters across 
dimensional rifts with Sandra 
Bullock. The movie also stars 
Robert Downey Jr. and Woody 
Harrelson, the perfect people to 
star in a movie with an anti-drug 
message, dont ya think? Go: Trippy 
animation style is perfect for this 
material, and helps Keanu appear 
to be a more expressive actor than, 
well, ever. Also, it looks really, really 
cool. No go: Kind of a downer. The 
movie is less action and more chit
chat.
Mission: Impossible 3
Saturday, November 11 
7:30 10 12:30
I know you dont want to see crazy 
couch-jumping Tom Cruise, but 
trust me, you want to see this. 
Paired with director J.J. Abrams 
(Lost, Alias, Felicity), a brilliant Philip 
Seymour Hoffman (Capote) and 
a script filled with summer action 
delights like a helicopter chase 
through a windmill farm and a BASE 
jump from Shanghai skyscrapers, 
Cruise leads the perfect flick to help 
you forget that its probably snowing 
outside. Go: You would expect it 
to stink, but really, it doesnt. Trust 
me. Watch Keri Russell (Felicity) 
brandish a firearm. No go: As 
nonsensical and ridiculous as 
you would expect from anything 
involving Tom Cruise. Itll still be 
cold outside when its over.
Saving Face
Sunday, November 12

Two Chinese lesbians (Michelle 
Krusiec and Lynn Chen) living in 
New York under the watchful eye 
of a strict but secretly pregnant 
mother (Joan Chen) who is herself 
under the watchful eye of her own 
parents... I smell a sitcom! This 
charming little romantic comedy/ 
culture clash/mystery movie 
has something for everyone. A 
charming debut from new director 
Alice Wu. Go: Great performances 
from everyone. I promise you, just 
because there are lesbians doesnt 
mean that its pom. No go: I read 
the description and my first snarky 
thought was, Is this My Big Fat 
Chinese Wedding? So that might 
paint the wrong picture for you.

Diddling, jiUing off, double-clicking the mouse  "Whatever You Wanna 
Call It, Were Gonna Talk About It." Thats the mantra of the latest 
workshop coming to Garfield Artworks: a session on female masturbation 
hosted by local business Girls Night In.
cIt's going to be a guided discussion, said owner and co-founder of 
Girls' Night In, Karen Derzic. Were not going to pull people out of their 
chairs and ask them to tell their stories, but if somebody wants to do that 
were not going to say no." Established in 2003, Girls Night In is both an 
informational resource and a vendor of sexual merchandise. The basis of 
the business was always about education at the forefront," said Derzic.
Fully titled Whatever You Wanna Call It, Were Gonna Talk About It... 
Women's Masturbation," the workshops goal is to provide a forum for 
women to discuss masturbation and other aspects of sexuality in an open 
environment. That title actually came about because weve learned 
that people call it so many different things and dont often just say 
masturbation," said Derzic.
Pillow talk
From she-bopping to buttering the muffin, theres certainly humor 
associated with the various euphemisms for female masturbation.
Of course, the equivalent male pastime is not without its own set of 
colloquialisms (greasing the flagpole, choking the chicken), but the 
problem with female masturbation is that its almost never discussed 
in candid terms  and when people dont talk about it, they dont 
understand it. Theres a lot of misconception that the only way to have an 
orgasm is if somethings in the vagina," Derzic said. For some, restriction 
to vaginal intercourse could only guarantee a dissatisfying sex life. Many 
women cannot have an orgasm that way, Derzic explained.
There are plenty of other ways for women to satisfy themselves sexually.
It may come from clitoral stimulation; it may come from stimulation of the 
breasts; it may come from a mental picture that you have, Derzic said. 
There are women around the world who can orgasm just through mindplay.
In the realm of sexuality, there are no standards. One of the things I talk 
about is [that you have to] just explore your own body. Youre your own 
best judge to find out what you like and what you dont like, Derzic said. 
"Its just amazing that womens bodies are so unique, she said, explaining 
the need for self-exploration. But such individuality can breed insecurity, 
doubt, and even shame.
The ins and outs
We dont really talk about female genetalia, said Brenda Lee Green, 
the vice-president for education at Planned Parenthood of Western 
Pennsylvania. Children are exposed to the discrepancy between male and 
female anatomies at an early age. Little boys have publics, little girls 
have privates, Green explained, referencing an insight originally coined 
by sexologist Jessie Potter.
The evidence practically speaks for itself. Most of the slang for female 
genitalia is derogatory in nature, and a lot of it doubles as ways to refer to 
women themselves. Conversely, male genital regions are often referred to 
with pet names: Wee Wee, Johnson, Mr. Happy. These words make the 
penis seem cute, friendly. They distance the penis from its owner and 
endow it with a personality. It's this unspoken message about female 
anatomy," Green said.
The very structure of a womans body promotes the notion that female sex 
organs are private, not public. In a mens public bathroom or locker room, 
you can see some things, said Derzic. Even in a women's locker room 
you're not going see much because its all hidden away."
The effort to bring the truth about womens bodies  and their sexuality
 into the forefront began in the 70s. Much of Derzic's work, particularly 
her plans for the upcoming workshop, is influenced by author and sexual
educator Betty Dodson. In 1974, Dodson published Sex For One, the first 
book to frankly discuss the topic of female masturbation. At that point it 
was really thought of as a mans thing," Derzic said. In the text, Dodson 
included her own sexual experiences.
But the most enlightening components of Sex For One are the 16 drawings 
of female genitalia, each created by Dodson, who holds a degree in fine 
arts. Sex For One showcases the variety in the female body. The 16 
drawings are surprisingly dissimilar. You can see that youre normal, 
Derzic said. "Youre not wrong; youre not weird; youre not broken
 youre just you."
While Dodson was attempting to educate the masses, sex in the '70s 
left the men in control. There was this rationale in womens minds that 
only bad girls get birth control, said Green. "So-called good girls get 
pregnant. But to what extent has society become sexually enlightened? 
According to Derzic, sexual education based in abstinence has left many 
young adults ignorant of contraceptive methods, hot to mention their 
anatomy. "Youre really coming up in a time where ignorance is bliss," she 
said. In reality, theres college kids who are like, Whats going on with my 
body?"
Green agreed that many sexually active adults and teenagers still have 
some growing up to do. "If you can't talk about it, you really shouldnt be 
doing it," she said. Planned Parenthood receives anonymous calls every 
day from clients who can baiely explain their situations. Often, callers are 
unable to discuss the parts of the bodies involved in sex because they 
simply dont know about them. Theres this misconception that the goal 
of sexual education is to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted 
diseases, Green said. But whats just as important in any school program 
is that it should leave its students feeling comfortable and informed about 
their bodies.
Jamie McElroy, a buyer for South Side retail store Slacker, complained 
about Pittsburgh in particular. Located on East Carson Street, Slacker 
offers sex toys in addition to a host of other merchandise including jewelry, 
home accessories, and alternative literature  in McElroy's words, 
Everything from mild to not so mild."
We tend to keep it a little tame, said McElroy, citing the stores location 
in an area frequented by tourists. I get so many girls that come in 
giggling, she said. "All in all, Pittsburgh is kind of buttoned-up.
The new Tupperware
It's just that kind of buttoned-up atmosphere that allows businesses like 
Girls Night In to thrive. Derzic makes some of her sales online, but what 
really sets Girls Night In apart is its parties. Derzic leads about one or 
two a month, each basically a sexually charged version of a Tupperware 
sit-down. The way that those were brought up is it was an easy way for - 
women to get together and have a social function as well as purchase 
something nice for their homes," said Derzic.
But the similarity ends there. Derzic doesnt cater to pastel-colored 
housewives. The burp-proof lids, the microwave demonstrations  these 
things have been replaced by dildos, lubricants, and so on. Like Dodson 
in Sex For One, Derzic employs diagrams of male and female genitalia to 
help inform her clientele. "People walk away with some understanding of 
their bodies," Derzic said. I love walking away from those parties where 
Im exhausted because I've talked to everybody, and everybodys happy."
Derzic offers her services to women of all ages, even men. The parties 
start out with bringing a group of friends together," Derzic explained. Her 
clients range from coworkers to relatives to members of nearby sororities 
and fraternities. Hardly any other businesses similar to Girls Night In 
host parties open to both genders. I firmly believe that you have to talk 
to everybody involved in the situation, said Derzic.
In addition to educating her clients, Derzic helps them feel comfortable 
discussing their bodies and sexual needs. "People walk away with not 
only, This is a vibrator, this is where I put it, she said, They walk away

I'll have what shes having
%
For Derzic, the upcoming workshop on masturbation shares the same 
ideals as the Girls Night In parties. Unfortunately, many women in the area 
who would benefit most from such an event may not even feel comfortable 
enough to attend. "Im well aware that we're probably not going to get 
everyone were hoping to target at the event," said Derzic, who may plan 
workshops in the future catering to a more uptight clientele.
Until then, one attractive alternative to parties and workshops is the wealth 
of reading material in print and on the Web. Dodson has written multiple 
books on the subject of sexuality, but the list goes on. Additionally, the 
Girls Night In website includes a list of links to educational websites. 
"Everything is not going to work for everyone else, said Green. I always 
say your comfort level is like a rubber band. If you stretch it too far, itll 
break."
The important thing is to empower people about their own sexuality so 
that they can be happy," Derzic said. The workshop will provide a forum 
for women to help each other  and to help themselves. Theres plenty 
of people who have taken the exact same steps before you, who have kind 
of paved the way, Derzic said. Hopefully this workshop will bring out at 
least a little bit of that."

Such knowledge is critical when it comes to maintaining a relationship. 
"Its sometimes awkward to say, 'Over here, 'A little to the left, 'Not so

going to have a good, long-lasting, loving relationship is to communicate 
with your partner about everything, sex especially.

412: The area code of creative nonfiction
Local festival recognizes the latest trend in writing
Exploring where the line is drawn between fact and fiction, 
perception and reality, the 412 Creative Nonfiction Festival 
starts today in Pittsburgh and runs through Saturday. It is a 
"celebration of excellent writing," according to the festival's 
press release, and will bring together students, writing 
enthusiasts, and professional writers to discuss contemporary 
" issues in the up-and-coming genre of creative nonfiction. 
Such issues as ethics in writing, giving poetry a mission, and 
publishing ones work will be at the forefront of the festival.
"Pittsburgh is a great community for writers, explained Jane 
Bernstein, associate professor of English at Carnegie Mellon, 
who will moderate a discussion panel at 412. Theres a real 
appreciation for fiction and poetry in this city." According 
to both budding and professional writers in the surrounding 
boroughs, Pittsburgh has a vibrant literary community, which 
could gain exposure and grounding through the popularity of 
the upcoming convention.
Moreover, "Pittsburgh is the birthplace of the current creative 
nonfiction movement," said Faith Adiele, assistant professor 
of creative nonfiction writing at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh, 
who will read her own work and will be a panelist discussing 
how to fund a writing career at the festival. Lee Gutkind, the 
412 Festival director, started the first graduate program in the
genre, as well as the journal Creative Nonfiction, here. It has to 
be Pittsburgh."
Exposing the prevalence of the genre will only happen, 
however, if the festival can draw in a diverse array of visitors 
and participants and explain to them the importance of the 
genre of creative nonfiction. Festival director Lee Gutkind 
wrote in an e-mail that creative nonfiction is the fastest 
growing genre in the publishing and academic writing 
community." While the studies of fiction and poetry have been 
traditionally examined in English classes worldwide, Bernstein 
added to Gutkind's assertion by stating that creative nonfiction 
is "a healthier genre than fiction." Creative nonfiction is 
grounded in reality and truth, as writers take real-life events 
and ideas and compose them in a creative, literary manner. 
Advanced cultural ideas can be approached by non-writers, 
exposing them to the new genre and forcing them to think 
about the relation of the writing to their own lives.
The festival offers a number of highlights. H.G. Buzz" 
Bissinger, author of Friday Night Lights, will hold a discussion 
of his novel, followed by a screening of the movie version.
There will be several free events, including a "literary 
marathon" to start the festival, a poetry reading with a 
mission to connect critical readers to adventurous writers,
and a discussion called Selling What You Write: Breaking 
into Freelancing, which will offer tips to make a piece of 
writing (and a writer) successful. Hilary Masters, a well-known 
Carnegie Mellon professor of English and creative writing, 
will discuss the inner workings of memoir writing, and craft 
workshops focusing on specific aspects of writing will be 
offered.
Gutkind suggested that the discussions on ethics and morals 
in writing, which will ask questions about the appropriate and 
inappropriate use of facts and subjects in writing, will be the 
most interesting for those in attendance. He supposes that 25 
to 35 percent of those attending the festival will be students 
from universities and colleges throughout Pittsburgh. Writing 
enthusiasts, and those students simply intrigued by the festival 
itself, will be able to talk with and learn from professionals, 
and will find others that share a belief in the importance of the 
written and spoken word.
Adult tickets to the festival are $30, and students are $15 with 
valid LD. Order online at www.proartstickets.org, or by phone:

The cerebral moviegoing experience
Three Rivers Film Festival will make you think
Carnegie Mellon offers a dollar movie four or five times a 
week, but only once a year does the city of Pittsburgh host 
the annual Three Rivers Film Festival, a celebration of film 
new and old. The festival, now in its 25th year, showcases 
films more closely linked to works of art than mainstream 
blockbusters, which thus require a bit more attentiveness 
to appreciate their ingenuity and avant-garde quality. This 
years films are no exception.
The two-week festival, held November 2-16, features over 40 
films. Movies made in Pittsburgh by local filmmakers, shorts, 
independent films, documentaries, and international works 
will be played in various theaters around the city. The films 
range from current hot topics  such as the documentary 
Home Front, which chronicles the life of United States soldier 
Jeremy Feldbusch, an amputee from the Iraq war  to artsy 
films like La Moustache  a psychological thriller about a 
man who has worn a mustache every day of his life, only to 
one day shave it off and find out that no one remembers him 
ever having facial hair in the first place.
"Three Rivers is a well-run festival with an interesting, 
eclectic selection of films  it's a great opportunity for 
students to see films they would have difficulty seeing 
anywhere else," said creative writing professor Jim Daniels, 
who has written and co-produced two films. Daniels film
Dumpster, about the unlikely relationship between a janitor at 
an elite university and a student who lives in a dumpster, was 
selected for last year's festival and has since been selected for 
eight other festivals around the country.
Jeffrey Hinkelman, who teaches a film studies course at 
Carnegie Mellon, worked as crew and as an extra on the film 
When Tyrants Kissed, showcased at the festival in 2004. At 
this years festival, Hinkelman recommends the films Speedy 
and Pandora's Box.
"There is not a lot .of opportunity to see silent film the way it 
was intended," Hinkelman said, referring to the fact that both 
of these silent films will be accompanied by live musicians, 
who improvise the music according to the action on screen. 
Philip Carli, who, according to the festivals website, has 
composed piano accompaniments for over 50 films and has 
toured throughout North America and Europe, played at 
yesterdays showing of Pandoras Box. The Alloy Orchestra 
will add a unique sound to the feel-good comedy Speedy, 
starring Harry Lloyd, on November 16 by utilizing household 
items such as garbage can lids as instruments and sound 
effects to accompany the film.
In addition to the two silent features, Hinkelman recommends 
The Chelsea Gtls, an Andy Warhol film that is not often
shown because it requires the use of two projectors. Slightly 
ambiguous instructions must be Mowed describing the 
approximate time to turn one monitor off and the other on, so 
every presentation of the film is slightly different.
"People should be willing to watch anything, but the Three 
Rivers Film Festival brings films that are that much harder 
to see," Hinkelman said, [and] here its all in one place." 
Although the films played at this years festival will require a 
bit more thinking than, perhaps, making a batch of popcorn, 
they will most certainly enrich ones future film experiences as 
they enlighten the viewer to the artistic qualities of film.
Tickets for the films range from $7 to $10 each, and times and 
schedules for each film can be found at the festival's website:

Try doing a One Foot Japan to a 180-kickflip. Thats 2000 points right 
there.
It can be tough not being a sore loser, so think about picking up a sport 
where its harder to get upset when its over. I would suggest gladiatorial 
combat.
Now would be a good time to replace the batteries in your smoke 
detector. Good luck finding it though, since you ripped it off your ceiling 
the day you moved in.
The planets are aligned in such a way that they are impairing your 
fashion sense. That sweater you like actually looks rather awful. Also, 
Jupiter thinks ft makes you look fat, and thats saying a lot.
With the holiday season coming up, now would be a good time to 
start saving some extra cash for all the cool things you want to get 
over winter break. These used to come in the form of presents, but 
your parents have decided that your education is enough of a stocking 
stuffer.
What a relief! October is finally over, and you can feel confident about 
starting a new month. However, the rest of the galaxy doesnt really care 
about our human-made calendar, and things will most likely continue 
to be annoying.
Your arch-nemesis has once again foiled your plans of impressing that 
certain someone you like, and instead made you look like a complete 
klutz. Stupid gravity!
The next time you go grocery shopping, youll stop at the produce 
section and imagine all the bananas coming to life and singing 
Bohemian Rhapsody. Your consequent maniacal laughter will result in 
taking the rest of the semester off, but it will be totally worth it.
I would recommend that you stop wearing clothes from other 
universities, i understand you want to go to MIT, but youre just going 
to confuse classmates who have enough to deal with.
You still havent started that 10-page paper and the deadline is fast 
approaching. You have your notes and the outline ready, but just need 
to start typing. I would recommend avoiding www.ytmnd.com, seeing 
as how thats the reason you were up until 5 a.m. yesterday.
When life gives you lemons, making lemonade is always a good idea. 
However, that also requires a lot of other ingredients that can be a strain 
on your budget. I wouldnt recommend squeezing lemon juice into your 
wounds either. Maybe you should avoid lemons altogether.
Guitar Hero II comes out this week. Your friends will miss seeing you, 
but its obvious that you have better things to do
