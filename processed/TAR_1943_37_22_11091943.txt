All-Star Team To Play 
Army In Grid Contest 
In Bowl This Thursday
Come one, come all. The oppor
tunity of your lives presents itself 
this Thursday in the Carnegie Bowl. 
As an Armistice Day celebration, 
the All-Stars of the civilian intra
mural touch football league will 
play the Champions of the Army 
league for the school football cham
pionship . The Kiltie Band will give 
an exhibition of its skill at the half 
just as at varsity football games 
down in the Stadium. There will 
be loud speakers on hand to give a 
play-by-play description to those 
observers who might have questions 
in their minds about the various 
plays and players. And, believe it 
or not, all this will be free.
All-Star games have been run off 
at the end of many intramural com
petitions, but this one will be by 
far the best and most elaborate, and 
one that no self respecting Tech stu
dent should miss.
The civilian members of the team 
will be: Robinson, Citcom; Kelly, 
Independents; Wylie, SAE; Lucas, 
Citcom; Landerman, TDP; Smith, 
DU; Byers, KS; Hunter, Citcom; 
Nelesen, KS; Johe, Citcom; Arnold, 
Citcom, Steinman, TDP.
Army men will be excused from 
their 5:40 formation in order to 
watch this great contest, and many 
are expected to be present. In a 
contest of this type, enough civilian 
interest ought to be aroused to war
rant a good attendance from that 
group, too.
War Fund Quota 
Topped By Tech
The biggest moment of the year 
came last Friday to our own Pro
fessor Kent Shaffer, chairman of the 
Education branch of the Public Af
fairs Division of the United War 
Fund Drive in Pittsburgh, when he 
announced that Carnegie has topped 
its campaign quota of $5,400 bv a 
whisker clipping margin of $15.00. 
Tech and ProfessorShaffer can 
well be proud of their response to 
the campaign, since Carnegie Tech 
went over its quota; while Alle
gheny County was behind its quota 
by $875,000 when the last figures 
came in Friday afternoon.
The Carnegie personnel, faculty, 
and the student body did'their parts 
nobly in meeting our school quota. 
The students contributed $1,693.40 
to the fund and the faculty and per
sonnel gave $4,722.50. Special com
mendation is due the 37 girls in the 
Westinghouse Engineering Program 
for Women who gave $50.00 to the 
fund. The ASTP came through in 
fine style, too, with $800.00almost 
half the entire student contribution 
to their credit. " '
Carnegie Institute offers sincere 
thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Peter Muller-Munk for their great kindness in 
contributing $150.00 to the Tech 
fund in honor of Mrs. MullerMunks recently deceased father, 
Mr. Max Lowenthal.
Reverend Baker, Pitt Graduate, 
Speaker For This Weeks Chapel
Just because we are living in 
difficult times, there are more op
portunities than ever before for 
character building, for tribulations 
make a better person out of you. 
With these forceful words Rever
end John Paul Baker, Jr., this 
weeks chapel speaker explained the 
essence of his sermon Blessed Be 
the North Wind, to be given at 
11:00 in the Little Theater.
Having graduated from Pitt in 38, 
this youthful ministers career fol
lows the typical pattern of Local 
boy makes good. Following his 
college career, which, incidently in
cluded a year in China as an ex
change student, Reverend Baker en
tered Western Theological Sem
inary on the North Side. Though he 
is now a minister at the Mount 
Lebanon Presbyterian Church. Rev
erend Baker has occupied pulpits 
in several mining towns near Wash
ington, Pa., as well as at the Man
chester Presbyterian Church.
Despite the fact that Reverend 
Baker is a Pitt man, he feels that he 
has a definite relationship with 
Tech, considering that he was the 
man in the Panther skin at the 
annual frays between the two 
schools.
Though the only vocal exercise 
that he gets now is from the pulpit,
United War Fund To Receive 
Proceeds From Junior Prom
Giving a note of war-time solemnity to the forthcoming Junior Prom 
held at the Hotel Schenley, Saturday evening, November 13, Co-Chair
men Helen Robinson and Johnny Wolff announce that all proceeds 
above cost of the dance will be donated to the United War Fund.
Featured at the colorful affair, which will be informal this year for 
the first time, will be Bill LeRoy and his orchestra. Having played al
ready at a number of school functions, they are well known for their 
smooth renditions of current num
bers. Jack LaBelle will be con
ducting.
Also included on the program 
Saturday evening will be the an
nual election of the Prom Queen.
Following' custom, the entire student 
body will have an opportunity to cast 
their ballots for any three girls in the 
Junior Class this morning between 
eleven and one. Polling places will 
be set up in Fine Arts, Industries and 
Margaret Morrison. ASTP men are 
asked to cast their ballots in Adminis
tration Hall. Following the voting, 
tallies will be taken and the three 
top ranking girls will be the nomi
nees to be voted upon at the dance 
Saturday evening.
Co-Publicity Chairmen, La Verne 
Long and Ed Uber announce that 
the admission price will be $2.20 
per couple. Tickets will be on sale 
at the noon hour every day this 
week in Administration Hall.
this former Delta Tau Delta mem
ber used to be in the Pitt Cheer
leaders Squad. Those of you who 
saw Our Town when it was pro
duced at the Playhouse several 
years ago/ perhaps remember him 
as the personable young actor with 
the leading part. As another evi
dence of his versatility, Reverend 
Baker admitted that at one time, 
he was a photographers model.
Even though these varied activ
ities seem to have little to do with 
his present vocation Reverend Bak
er explained, I feel all the experi
ences Ive had aid me in making ad
dresses from the pulpit.
Quality Control Course 
Joint CIT, WPB Project
An 8-day course of lectures and 
discussions on Quality Control by 
Statistical Methods will open on

Changed ASTP Group 
Came Back Yesterday
Again the wheel of fortune and 
studies spins, and a somewhat new 
group of ASTs comes to the Car
negie campus. Some of the old faces 
are not back, and some new faces 
have been added, but many old 
acquaintances are still open for re
newal. This term the courses will 
be more advanced and perhaps 
tougher, but the group returning is 
better prepared for having had this 
quartermasters training.
Somehow the campus didnt seem 
the same with the Army gone. The 
plain and fancy hut-two-threefours didnt bounce back from the 
buildings, the long linps didnt block 
traffic in front of the Commons, and 
the ROTC drill hour passed without 
a single wooden rifle comment.
Nine New Freshmen Towho passed the A-12 examinations 
given last spring. They are memBegin First Semester
bers of the Army on inactive duty. 
They were not subject to call from 
the Army until their eighteenth 
birthday, but enlisted as members 
of the ASTRC. They will remain 
at Tech, wearing civilian clothes 
but taking ASTP courses, until 
their eighteenth birthdays. At this 
time they will be sent to army 
camps, where they will receive the 
basic training given to all members 
of the ASTP. From there they will 
proceed to different colleges to con
tinue their studies. At present they 
are being quartered in the lower 
end of Industries Hall.
Nine boys began their freshman 
year yesterday under the tri-se
mester plan. Five of t.hrm have en
tered the mechanical engineering 
department, two chemical engineer
ing, and one each in the civil and 
electrical engineering departments. 
Of the nine, onlv two are from out
side the state of Pennsylvania, their 
homes being in Illinois and Massa
chusetts. Most of these boys are 
under eighteen, since they have 
completed their high school courses 
under speeded-up programs to fin
ish training before being called into 
the service.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1943
Cditosik CditososkE
I looked out of the window, and there, against a backdrop of build
ings and fading trees, was our flag, whipped by the wind, stretched as if 
to cover the entire campus. Our flag . . . just a piece of cloth, with colors 
and stripes and stars, turned out by the hundreds in some prosaic fac
tory by busy hands and whirring machines. Yet for each of us that color
ed fabric stands for something . . . the thing we call our country, Colum
bia, the United States of America.
Yes, it stands for this countryand we like to pretend that it stands 
for all we are flagwaving about . . . democracy, liberty, equality, and 
fraternity. Does it really? Are we democratic in our thinking; do we ac
cept our neighbors as our equals; are we willing to sacrifice our own good 
for that of everybody? The answer is no! I do not know whether we 
were ever conscious of democracy, and lost this consciousness; or whether 
we never possessed it; the fact remains that in spite of all our loquacious 
patriotism, the flagwaving and the self-deception that we have a demo
cratic spirit, we are more prejudiced, more bigoted, smaller minded than 
any other country with the exception of Germany.
Just take a look at the newspapers ... a few months ago Detroit 
had a riot equalled only by the exhibitions of Hitlers stormtroopers. Chi
cago is one hotbed of seditious organizations and publications, The Sword 
and the Cross, the works of Mrs. Engel and Joe McWilliams. In Boston 
children are beaten up because of their different faith. In Brooklyn hood
lums desecrated graves, broke tombstones, and threw over monuments. 
All this is but a small part of the many incidents happening all over the 
country.
True, the instigators of these shameful events are but a very small 
minority, organized by a few people who even today try to establish 
fascism in this country. The danger does not lie in these deeds alone. The 
terrible proof of our bigotry lies in the undeniable apathy we have to
wards these signs of approaching fascism. If, perchance, we finish the 
comics soon enough and do turn to the front page and read about riots and 
racial hatred, we shrug it off . . .it does not concern us.
With this denial of danger, this complacency of the average American, 
we lose our democracy. We have seen at Pearl Harbor what military con
sequences such an attitude must have . . . and if we do not wake up to 
the facts that are glaring into our faces, we will see the political conse
quences in ten, or twenty, or thirty years, when our children will have 
to fight another war for what we could have now, and do not seem to want.
E. L.
Erratum
The TARTAN wishes to correct a serious error in last weeks issue. 
Due to an unintentional oversight on the part of the staff, two cuts, that 
of William Frew, new chairman of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
and that of Dalziel McKelway, the Assistant Registrar here at school, 
were interchanged in the final make-up of the paper. We sincerely re
gret that a mistake of this sort was made and in no way attempt to deny 
any responsibility.
We do wish to explain, however, to those readers who are wont to 
place undue emphasis upon the negligence of the staff, that such accidents 
will happen even in the best and oldest newspapers, among which we do 
not number the TARTAN. We of a greatly undermanned, inexperienc
ed staff have had our hands full getting your paper to you every Tuesday. 
It is with deepest concern that we note mistakes such as appeared in our 
past paper. We are no more proud of such issues than you are. Neverthe
less, we ask that you bear with us and try to understand that we, like 
everyone today, are working under wartime stress and wartime lack of 
manpower. We fully realize the obstacles that lie in the way of our ap
proaching the true TARTAN standards, but we shall endeavor to do all 
in our power to bring you an unblemished paper in the future.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

John Wolffwith two fs please 
is enrolled in the most difficult 
course in the engineering school 
and yet manages to be one of the 
busiest fellows on campus. His ac
tivities, the number of which hov
ers in the high teens, includes, in 
part, president and house manager 
of Delta Tau Delta, president of 
YMCA and member of Y cabinet, 
Tau Beta Pi, PiDE, Delta Skull, 
Scimitar, last years Student Coun
cil, secretary of Interfraternity 
Council, and the Math Club.
Johnny, who comes from a farm 
near Greensburg, Pennsylvania, al
ways wanted to come to Carnegie 
Tech, but it was a Westinghouse 
scholarship which made it possible. 
So, in September, 1940, he left the 
farm life he loves to come to Tech 
and get educated.
But his education was not all in 
the books. He found a great deal 
in the people he met and knew. 
More interested in people, the hu
man element, than in anything cut 
and dried, he maintains that meet
ing a new person is a wonderful ex
perience.
John has had excellent oppor
tunities for meeting people because 
of the great number of his affilia
tions. The people he meets feel that 
knowing John Wolff is a great ex
perience, also, because of his friend
ly manner and gentle philosophy. A 
tall, handsome fellow, he believes 
in comfort before beauty, and thus 
wears neat, conservative clothes 
rather than the flashy, pre-war col
legiate kind.
Carnegie Tech is a wonderful col
lege to attend, thinks John, for it is 
large enough to have national pres
tige and yet small enough so that 
the students arent lost in a hodge
podge of humanity. His philosophy 
on school life is simple and un
doubtedly agreeable to everyone 
be a part of the school.
Being an active man himself,
. . . John Wolff
John knows what excellent experi
ence can be gained from contact 
with people in an organization, for 
he warns: At the present time, 
there is very little participation in 
school activities by members of 
the freshman class; the few people 
who are active are left-overs from 
past semesters. Knowing from per
sonal experience, I urge inactive 
students to enter into campus af
fairs for a good time as well as 
prestige.
One must not get the impression 
from the foregoing that John Wolff 
is a deadbeat spending all his life in 
a lab or at a meeting. He is really 
very human. He likes to dance, 
preferably to smooth, dreamy music, 
usually with his favorite partner, 
Jackie Moyer, who wears his Delt 
pin and is the reason for his fre
quent trips to Greensburg. When 
asked about his feeling for Frank 
Sinatra, he tersely and emphatically 
said, Ill take Bing Crosby. 
Although he is not yet certain of 
his plans after graduation in De
cember, he is sure that when he 
settles down, it will be on a farm 
I prefer country life to city life, 
especially Pittsburgh life.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Le Gallienne, Joseph Schildkraut 
Lecture On The Future Of Theatre
By Lucille
The tiny studio theatre opposite 
Industries Hall was crammed to 
overflowing with Drama faculty and 
Drama students last Thursday 
about two oclock. Everyone was 
waiting. Doors opened and Mary 
Morris of the faculty ushered a man 
and a woman into the theatre. Ap
plause! Applause from the moment 
they stepped in until they were 
safely and informally seated on the 
edge of the stage, feet hanging. 
They were Eva Le Gallienne and 
Joseph Schildkraut, stars of Uncle 
Harry.
Miss Le Galliennes concern for 
the theatre as art and not as a 
gaudily-bound best seller created 
the Civic Repertory Theatre in New 
York, a theatre which presented 
every sort of play from classic to 
modern in repertory style similar to 
that of the Metropolitan Opera in 
the studio theatre. Miss Le Gal
lienne, dressed in a simple suit, and 
completely informal, answered 
questions of all sorts and types, and 
left no doubt anywhere as to the 
strength of her convictions about 
the deep, desperate need for an
other such theatre in America, nor 
her tremendous desire to do some
thing about achieving it.
Mr. Schildkraut, her companion, 
was equally sincere in his belief 
that there must be a good theatre in 
this country. Mr. Schildkraut, 
Thursday afternoon, was a perfect 
complement to Miss Le Gallienne. 
Where she was caustic, he was rath
er exuberant. While she illustrat
ed her points with quick anecdotes, 
he acted his out  hands, face/ 
voice. Although her personality 
set the tempo of the atmosphere, 
Mr. Schildkrauts magnificently 
handsome face and his continental 
charm evoked plaintive sighs from 
all quarters feminine. A Hungarian 
actor, son of a great actor, Mr. 
Schildkraut served his apprentice
ship in the Repertory Theatre un
der Max Reinhardt and was able 
to dot each I proferred by Miss 
Le Gallienne with examples from 
Europe.
The idea of repertory theatre 
rather than the Broadway theatre, 
which limits itself to a new play 
for as long a run as can be squeez
ed and then the ashcan, is hardly a 
new one, but Miss La Gallienne is its 
chief proponent in America. It is 
the simple idea of a permanent com
pany with many plays in its reper
toire presenting different plays all 
the time. The existing system of 
presentation in New York is not 
considered theatre at all by Mr. 
Schildkraut; Miss Le Gallienne sim
ply says, What we call our thea
tre.
There is no place in her mental 
conception of the art of the theatre

for a compromise. You can go in
to the theatre commercially or you 
can build it into a rare thing. What 
we have now is a library of best 
sellers and nothing else. There 
must be a revolt and a revolution 
of the theatre.
Miss Le Gallienne uses compact 
little phrases. When a Pittsburgher 
told her he wasnt interested in fi
nancing a play about fruit Chekovs 
Cherry Orchard she murmured 
that it was really more about real 
estate. When a student questioned 
the facility of the crew work in
volved in presenting different 
plays nightly, she commented, No 
difficulty. Just overtime. After 
everyone in the theatre had been 
reduced to pensive silence, she turn
ed to Mr. Schildkraut and closed the 
afternoons discussion with What a 
gloom weve cast over this place.

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1943
Two Tartan Reporters Enlightened By Talk 
With Three Free French Fighter Aviators^cd&i in KUcJu
Last Sunday afternoon, the Tar
tan had the pleasure of interview
ing three French sailors who unex
pectedly made an appearance at 
the Forbes Annex. The sailors 
were: Raymond Duffour, Jean Duhau and Charles Geraudeau, on 
leave after serving as naval aviators 
for over a year. Their intinerary in 
the United States so far includes 
New York, Chicago, Florida, Los 
Angeles, Boston and Hollywood. 
Raymond Duffour commented that 
Hollywood is just swell and he 
rates Charles Boyer and Maria 
Montez as his favorite actor and 
actress.
Raymond, speaking for the other 
two, left France four years ago after 
going to a French naval engineering 
school, and then joined the navy. 
Commenting on the view as seen 
from the Empire State Building, 
Raymond obliged with: Quite a
lookee!
The three boys superficially were 
easy-going, friendly young men,
with but a trace of the tenseness of 
the military flyer  yet underneath 
they were bitter and disappointed. 
They were typical examples of the 
youths who have to fight the war 
because of the blunders and stu
pidity of their elders; and they are 
resolved never to let it happen 
again. Their immediate ambition 
is to go out and fight les sales 
Boches until il ny quune jeune 
fille et un eunuch en Allemagne. 
Then, however, they are resolved 
to establish in France a government 
which will bring back the principles 
of the first Republic: the belief in 
the liberty and dignity of the com
mon man. They will take the coun
try in their own hands, and refuse 
to entrust it again to feeble and 
prejudiced oldsters who have 
brought upon France the present 
situation. No longer will their coun
try be run by corrupt politicians 
and self-centered financierspeace, 
to be permanent, will have to be 
established by youth.

Long Distance lines between busy cen

with calls these days.
Until we can get more copper and other 
materials to build more circuits, some Long

but remember, its better for us to wait for 
calls than to have our fighting men wait for

In Sports .. .
A toast to our noble cheerleaders, 
the forgotten few who, rain or 
shine, are always out in front cheer
ing our Tartans on to victory (?).
There are thirteen on the squad 
this yearfour boys and nine girls. 
Head of them all, and the only boy 
back from last year, is lanky Jerry 
OBrien, the big fellow with the 
fog-horn voice. Probably the most 
embarrassing moment for genial 
O-B was at the Lehigh game: 
while rendering a super Skibo 
yell, he stretched himself (and his 
pants) a little too far, and was 
forced to wear a raincoat for the re
mainder of the game.
Except for O-B, the boys are 
all new this year. The little red
head seen at every game is the hottempered Mr. Miller, or just plain 
Pinky, a pep-boy for four years 
at Wilkinsburg High School. Far
mer Merle WoliT is the husky, 6- 
foot, curly-haired blonde who 
wanted to be a cheerleader because 
he likes to jump around, and 
claims he is champion hog-caller of 
Greensburg. Bob Charpie is the 
new fellow whom you first saw at 
the Pep Rally and Pitt game.
Three girls are back again this 
year  Ruth Means, Jean Opdyke, 
and Rachel Hansen. Ruthie Means 
is the short, energetic brunette seen 
at all the gamesremember her a 
couple of weeks ago, cavorting 
around the Stadium with her new 
man, the Pitt Panther? She claims 
she wanted to be a cheerleader be
cause she loves to make people folHere are some of our cheerleaders in one of their rare quiet mo
ments. From left to right they are: Ruth Means, Bob Charpie, Rachel 
Hansen, Merle Wolff, Jackie Alexander, and Pinky Miller.

Rachel Hansen are both sophomore 
dramats; Jean is the tall, slender 
blonde (A wacky Amazon, says 
O-B, and Rachel the lively little 
brunette.
Of the twenty freshman girls who 
tried out for the yell squad only 
six made the grade. Regulars at all 
the games are Petie Cook and 
Jackie Alexander. Jackie, who hails 
from Mt. Lebanon, is short, with 
dark reddish-tinted hair, while 
Petie is short, dark, and surprising
ly quiet. Petie and her friend, Car
olyn Dill, were both cheerleaders 
for four years at Ben Avon High, 
and naturally wanted to continue 
at Tech. O-B says of Carolyn, 
She can say more words in a min

Your shirts are valuable items these days and 
appreciate special handling.
Turn up your shirt collar before sending it 
to the laundry. A collar washed flat doesn't fray 
so easily at the crease.
Have your shirts laundered frequently. A toosoiled shirt requires more scrubbing and conse
quently wears out more quickly.
Go easy on the starch. Starching stiffens fabric, 
so that it breaks instead of bending.
When you buy, buy Arrow. Arrow shirts are 
longer-lasting, better-fitting, and carry the San
forized label (fabric shrinkage less than 1%).

The nearness of the Christmas 
season has stimulated thought in 
the direction of planning an elab
orate celebration that would be en
joyable to all of the Evening School 
student body.
During the past several years, 
there has been a sharp decrease in 
attendance at social affairs, and if 
a Christmas party is to be a success, 
the committee that plans the soiree 
will have to consider the waning in
terest and do something to combat 
it.
It is quite possible that the rea
son for small turnouts is that the 
type of entertainment offered 
doesnt have enough drawing pow
er. Can it be that the collegiate 
swing sessions no longer hold the 
interest of Evening School students 
who are married and also above the 
average age of the day school stu
dent? If this is so, why not find en
tertainment that would be more 
consistent with the tastes of the 
Evening School student body?
Why not hold an informal dinner 
dance to celebrate the Christmas 
holiday? The event could take 
place during the Christmas recess 
between the first and second se
mesters, thus giving students a 
cKance to rejoice without being con
cerned about homework and sun
dry other things, which might hin
der chances for having a good time. 
Entertainment could be provided 
by various talented members of the 
student body during an intermis
sion between the dinner and dance, 
music for which could be provided 
by a local popular band.
This opinion is offered with the 
hope that something will be done to 
insure a successful Christmas cele
bration and to make it an annual 
affair. The final decision rests with 
the social committee, George Riffle, 
Chairman, Box 353, C. I. T. So, come 
on, all of you evening students, and 
send in suggestions.

Social Party A Gala Event
Hilarity and gaiety permeated 
Carnegie Union Saturday night 
when our first social event of the 
year got off to a fine start. Jitter
bugs and modern Pavlovas display
ed their talents to the music of the 
best bands in the land (where can 
you find a better juke box?)
The highlight of the evening, as 
usual, was the outburst from the 
social committee, eats; or maybe 
we should be more subdued, re
freshments were served.
Alas! A state of temporary chaos 
followedloss of small (paper) for
tunes on the Roulette wheelbut 
some of those unlucky ones walked 
off with the prizes. So their loss 
was a gain.
With the familiar strains of that 
every popular parting melody, we 
started for home  sorry to leave 
such a pleasant evening, but eager 
to retain the memories of a grand 
party.
