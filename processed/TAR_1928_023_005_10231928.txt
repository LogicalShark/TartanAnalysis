Annual Pitt-Camegie Clash Next Week At StadiumBoth Teams Primed.
The jinx is broken. For eight 
iong, Jean years the Tartans have 
seem game after game slip from 
their grasp. Large leads have been 
maintained until the end of the 
game drew near only to be elimi
nated by. a decree of Fate. Games 
have ended in tics. But now the 
power of the fickle Lady Luck has 
been broken, the Red and Black 
has lost its seemingly hypnotic 
power and the cause of Carnegie 
stands supreme. The Plaid have 
won, for the second time in his
tory, from that staunch little band 
of red-helmcted players who hail 
from that little college'nestled far 
away among the hills of Wash
ington County.W. & JThe" score, as befits the break
ing of an age-old jinx, was a 
magic score. Two years ago a 
squad of Tartans left for a se
cluded camp to prepare for a cer
tain team from South Bend. They 
returned a few days later and 
kicked, passed and ran their way 
to a 19-0 victory. Less than a 
week ago a similar squad left for 
the same camp and prepared in a 
similar manner. Last Saturday 
they returned and kicked, passed 
ana ran their way to another 19-0 
victory; and students made merry 
after each game. So one yis able 
to see that this year the Fates are 
smiling upon the gay colors of the 
Tartan Plaid.
No doubt it would please every
one if it could be said that the 
fame was a walkaway; that Cartegie held the upper hand throughut the game. But. such is not the 
ase. W. & J. arrived in town 
ith one of the fightingest football 
ams that Carnegie Tech has ever 
et. From the first whistle until 
le last the red helmets were in 
**ry play. In. fact, the first guar, thov/cd that W. & J. was playg the better game of the two. 
awards' run of 64 yards for a 
uchdown, which was later dislowcd, struck fear into the hearts 
Tartan supporters. It. seemed 
i if the'raid  jinx had started off 
a much more sensational mail* 
sr than usual. Even after the 
ill was brought back to the 37 
ird line, the Presidents did not 
dter, but continued with a derjnined drive toward the Caregie goal. It was on the 27 yard 
lark that they were finally stoped. Still trying for a score, the 
gliting Edwards, of W. & J., tried 
place kick but the ball traveled 
>w and wide.
It was not until the second, peiod that Carnegie scored its first 
juchdown. Captain, Harpster, playig his usual brilliant game, rcachd up, snared an enemy pass on 
3 42 yard line and then brought 
lie stands to their feet with a 
reathtaking demonstration of open 
eld running. Opposing tacklcrs 
icmed to grab every place where. 
: wasnt, or at least Harpy saw 
i it that where lie was one secnd he was not the next. The 
in ended with the oval resting
-.curely across the W. & J. goal.
In the third period, the Red
id Black started another vicious 
sault on the Tartan team. After 
arpster had scored a touchback, 
e visitors unleashed a whirlwind 
tack, alternating between line 
iihges and . passes, that carried 
ic .ball down to the Carnegie 28 
a'rd line. It. was at this point
lat the jinx was completely
;nashed. W. & J. not gaining an 
ich, seemed to relax ,_and the 
'laid started into real_ action. With 
iarcis unmerciful line smashes 
nd Harpsters bullet-like, well diected passes going into action, the 
all soon rested on the Presidents 
yard line. Then a pass to 
enzweig, who squirmed over the 
.1 line, netted the second score. 
:zelter booted the ball fairly and 
larely over the bar for the extra

Annual Military Ball Is 
Scheduled November 9
The Military Ball, according to 
the announcement of the R. O. 
T. C. Department, is to be held 
this year on November 9 in the 
Carnegie Union from 9 to 1.
This_ dance is rapidly becoming 
recognized as one of the best 
dances of the school year and this 
years ball is expected to surpass 
those of previous years in both 
originality of decoration and ex
cellence of music.
At this time the girls who are 
elected as Honorary Cadet Offi
cers in the election, taking place 
October 25, will be installed at a 
short ceremony.
The plans for the dance arc 
being formulated but as yet no 
decisions have been reached as to 
the orchestra, decorations, etc.
The attendance is not limited to 
R. O. T. C. students and the stu
dent body' is cordially invited to 
attend. A good time and memo
rable one is promised those who 
attend. Those who were there last 
year will remember the unique 
decorations, the  fine Gold and 
Blue orchestra and what a good 
time was had by all.
Watch 'next weeks Tartan for 
further announcement about orches

Y. W. C. A. Arranges For 
Advisors To Aid Freshmen
Faculty Members Bccomc Sources 
of Advice and Information 
For Plebes
The list of Freshman advisors 
has been posted on the bulletin 
board for the convenience of Fresh
men in receiving grades.
The six week period, at the end 
of which freshmen reports come 
Out, is almost completed, and ap
pointments for conferences with 
advisors, concerning the students 
record, will also be posted.
The system of appointing fresh
men advisors is primarily to aid 
students just entering college who 
are finding themselves in difficulties, 
both social and scholastic. The Y. 
W. C. A. has attempted to'provide 
fr social difficulties and a rapid 
adaptation to th new environment 
by the Big and Little Sister Move
ment. The Y. M. C. A. in past 
years has made provisions for men. 
To meet and to alleviate the fresh
mans scholastic difficulties, the sys
tem of freshman advisors has been 
devised.
The accomplishments of freshmen 
advisors are many. Not only do 
they explain the requirements for 
chosen courses, but they also give 
personal advice in the event that 
choice of course has not yet been 
made. Students arc free to go to

Students To Hold Pitt Game Pep Rally Thursday
Next _ Thursday evening at 7 p. 
m. a big pep meeting will be held 
to arouse enthusiasm for the .Pitt 
game, which is to be played Satur
day. Students are to meet in front 
of Margaret Morrison to give the 
team a spirited send-off to their 
retreat in the mountains. The band 
and cheerleaders will be present 
and a good turnout of students,
especially plebes, is desired.
The spirit shown at the pep'
meeting last Thursday noon was
terrible. Only a handful of stu
dents, and a very small part of the 
band, were present. While these 
cheered lustily and displayed some 
spirit, many more should have
turned out. The plebe attendance 
was a reflection on the Sophomore 
Regulations Committee. The plebes 
should attend all pep meetings and 
it is the duty of the Sophs to see 
that they do so.
Dont forget the big pep meet
ing of the year is next Thursday 
evening at 7 p. m. Everyone be 
out and lets display some Real 
spirit.
-rofessor Warners Painting, Snow Fall
On Exhibition At Carnegie International
"Snowfall, a picture^ of Carnegie 
nd its surroundings is being exibited at the. International at Caregie Institute. Professor Everett 
earner, f>f the Department of 
Painting and Decoration who 
painted this scene utilized a familiar 
ietting^ which he saw from the 
'nrnegie Campus. In fact, the 
scene was painted as Professor 
Varner looked out across Oakland 
rom a window in the clcctrical 
lepartment in Machinery Hall.
Professor Warner blocked on the 
.-.anvass the outlines of the scene, 
'hen he waited until the right dull, 
?ravish day came that suited his 
nood. The foreground of the piciire is a path of white heavy snow, 
diich covers the drabness of the 
eal scene. Following the path, 
he eye is attracted to a house at 
lie right. A row of buildings in 
rude semi-circle compels the onoker to follow the line of vision 
:ross the canvass, until at the 
it the path of snow, diverged 
ound_ the back of the buildings, 
again seen. The sky is grey,
light, suggestive of lavender; soft, 
fleecy clouds hang over the homes, 
and the fallen snow presents a 
feeling of softness and quiet. There 
is no special center of interestrather is there a sense of rhythm, 
a swish of interest along the line 
of the houses.
To the Carnegie student, also, 
th-re is the interest in the familiar 
which often makes a work as ap
pealing as its artistic merit. In 
Snowfall there is a corr.cr of the 
Institute, with the row of houses 
in back of it. There arc the little 
houses in the valley which are al
ways visible from up above. Near 
the center of the picture is the 
Greek Orthodox Church, whose 
two well-known long windows are 
faithfully portrayed. The Masonic 
Templq can be seen in the back
ground. When the picture was 
painted last winter the new build
ing of the Board of Public Educa
tion had not vet been erected.
Professor Warner is interested 
in color and perspective, and the

For the enlightenment of those 
who do not know all' the dope and 
dirt on Pittsburgh, as well as for 
those who. think they do, but dont, 
the Carnegie Puppet has taken 
upon itself to furnish light. To 
further this end the < Puppet^ will

due to appear on Oct. 31 and is ru
mored to be the best yet. It is ex

A Plaid Biplane Will Soon be a Reality
The Increase of Advanced 
Standing Co-eds Greatest 
In History of Institute
44 Different Institutions Arc Rep
resented Within the Group 
of the 73 Co-eds
Seventyrthree women students 
have been admitted to the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology: this year 
with advanced standing secured 
with credits from 44 different in
stitutions of higher learning, ac
cording to a report issued by Miss 
Mary Watson Green, Dean of 
Women. This is the largest num
ber of advanced standing cases 
among co-eds in the Institute/ 
history. The report points out 
also that this years record is an 
indication of the increasing tend
ency of students to take one or 
two years-of liberal arts studies in 
colleges and later to transfer to 
such institutions as Carnegie Tech 
in order to complete their educa
tion with technological studies.
Of the 73 co-eds credited with 
advanced standing, 42 are enrolled 
in the upper classes or as special 
students, in the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College. These, students 
are about evenly divided among the 
Departments of Secretarial Studies, 
Library Work, .Household Eco
nomics, and . Costume' Economics. 
The remainder of th.c 73 are en
rolled in the Department of Music, 
Drama, and Painting, and Decora
tion in the College of Fine Arts.

studied at the University of Pitts

It will certainly be a thrilling 
sensation to Carnegie students to 
see a plaid biplane bearing a huge! 
letter hovering over thecam-, 
pus<r Harvard already has live 
planes, and Carnegies initiation 
into aeronautics by the formation 
of the Flying Club would be a 
means of boosting Skibo to a com
petitive equality with other im
portant and progressive colleges. 
The cheerleaders might even devise 
a suitable yell for the "Spirit of 
Carnegie to be used when air 
races arc held in stadiums. Some 
phase of aviation might even be 
included in plebe regulations. Who; 
knows? The day may come when 
we will need air posters to prevent j 
students from parking their planes; 
around Arts School.
At a meeting held at McGill Hall 
lately, the Flying Club, whose purposc is to purchase an aeroplane for 
use of students in the club, made 
the first step towards its goal. This 
Club, the membership of which is 
strictly limited to 30 members, is, 
in form, a stock organization with 
a capital of $3,000. Thirty shares 
of stock with a par value of $100 
each have been issued to be sold 
to members of the Club, and eight 
of these shares have already been 
bought .by interested students. As 
soon , as 30 members have bought 
their stock certificates and $3,000 
is deposited .with the student coun
cil, which has been authorized to 
supervise all . finances, the Club 
will begin activities by flying its 
own plane from the hangars of the 
Advance' Aircraft Corporation of 
Troy, O:, where it is to be bought, 
to Bettis Field, McKeesport. The 
plane will be a new Waco 10 biY Drive Financial Returns 
Greatly Surpass Last Year
Tlie financial drive of the Y. M. 
C. A. and Y. W. C. A. is pro
gressing successfully to date. Com
plete returns have not as yet been 
received from the solicitors, but 
the nUmber turned in greatly ex
ceeds that of last year.
William McNeil, in charge of the 
mens division, and Ann McKee, 
who heads the womens division, 
urge that all solicitors see their 
prospects and turn in their results 
as soon as. possible.
According to the quoto board on 
the campus the .50. per . cent mark 
has already been passed with indi
cations that it will proceed higher.
The number of subscriptions re
ceived show that the students ap
preciate the various benefits which 
the Y extends and are anxious to 
join such an organization The 
subscription rate for women is 
$1 and for men $3. A national sub
scription for men is $5 ' and in

need no individual learners permits 
for its members who will be 
allowed to ' fly as student pilots. 
When a.member-has completed his 
ground school work and has satis
factorily learned the principles of 
flying, the. Club will'.arrange for 
the presence of a government ex

It has always been a recognized 
fact wherever Carnegie is known 
that for what we lack in other 
things we more than make up in 
spirit and enthusiasm. Many times 
in the past our athletic prospects 
have bec#i anything but bright, but 
when a Carnegie team stepped on 
the field, it could rest assured that 
it had the student body there with 
plenty of moral support.
A different situation faces us now. 
We have a team that is really 
good and ranks with the best col
lege teams of the country, and we 
have also a student body -that is 
almost indifferent to this fact. Our 
enthusiasm is fast growing cold, 
and the traditional Carnegie Spirit 
has become something to be looked 
back upon and admired, ratherthan 
maintained. To remedy .this sad 
state of affairs we can do several 
things, but at present we are in
terested in securing better organ
ized cheering from the stands. I 
say from the standi because at 
present most of the noise comes 
from the Kiltie band. This loyal 
group does more cheering in one 
game than the rest of the body 
of students in a whole season. 
Must we continue depending on 
the band for the music and cheer
ing at the games, or should we be 
satisfied with just listening to their 
good music and furnishing the 
cheers ourselves?
Our songs are another weakness.

meeting have been extended to 
others than members, to whom 
the subject will be of special in

In order to meet the heavy de

administrators of manual arts, the 
four-year course offered at Car
negie,'leading to a degree of. Bach

cation, is being reorganized. Re
organization of . the course is in 
charge of Professor Glen Uriel 
Cleeton, who was appointed head 
of the department at the close of 
the last school year. Professor 
Cleeton is a graduate ..of Missouri 
State Teachers College, having re

states that the plan of the course 
will be such as to provide sufficient 
training in shop work to enable 
men to teach a general shop with 
five distinct activities, and indivi
dual shops within the field of the 
students specialization. They will 
provide a broad, liberal education 
and, in addition, will include suf

experience.
Entrance requirements for this 
course are the same as those re

other courses regularly offered in 
the College of Engineering and 
Industries.
In addition to the regular fourvear degree course it is the inten

Delta Skull Holds
Initiation October 17
Delta Skull, Junior class honor
ary, held its annual initiation last 
Wednesday evening, October 17, at 
the Morrowficld Hotel. The affair 
was formal and was conducted by 
form members of last year's  hon
orary. Art Sidells acted as toaSt'jnaster, and Ted Zenk as chairman 
of the banquet.
Those initiated were: Robert
Wehrle, Thomas Lippcrt, Russel 
Lixterman, Phil Hubbard, George 
Kennedy, Thomas Brown, William 
Brown, Charles Suesserott, Julian 
Bond, Frederick Sangerster, Thomas 
Connelly, Kenneth Owens, Thomas 
Etheridge, Joseph Bush and George 
Becker.
The call for Delta Skull is made 
at the Qualifications Ceremony 
during Campus Week. The men 
are selected by the members of the 
active chapter, and are usually men 
who were. prominent in activities 
during their sophomore year. Dur
ing the year they take an active 
part -in the social functions, of the 
Junior class.
Latest reports indicate a capacit
or greater crowd at the Alumn 
Homecoming on the week-end of 
the. Pitt-Carnegie football game.
One old grad is bringing his wife 
clear across the continent in an 
airplane to the big doings. Because 
of the short time that they have 
available for the trip Mr. and Mrs. 
Frank E. Foster are taking the 
fastest possible means to get to 
the good time for the grads. Mr. 
and Mrs. Foster come to Pitts
burgh. in time for the football 
game Saturday, and will stay for 
the big Cabaret Dance in the eve
ning.  They . certainly plan a big 
time to repay them for their trip. 
Mr. Foster played on Carnegie's
first football team. He was cap
tain of the squad while he was
here.
Meanwhile tickets are going so 
rapidly that they indicate that
another room besides the main 
dining room will have to be used. 
That means over 350 alumni will 
be present.
Miss Andrews, the alumni secre 
tary, would like to hear from the 
secretaries of the various classes 
reporting the number of reserva
tions that have been made so tha! 
the plans may be more definitely 
carried out.
In addition to the program already 
announced several dances will be 
given by Crawford in the night 
dramatic school. The homecoming 
is a . wonderful opportunity for a 
revisit to old profs, old scenes, old 
friends, the fraternity house, the 
dorm, and to the gang in gen
eral.
The class, of 1908 will be espe
cially honored since it was the firs I 
graduating class. This will be it* 
twentieth reunion. Commemoratinj.! 
the event, a diamond-shaped plot
will be sunk in the floor of Ad
ministration Hall, with the yeai 
1908 on it. At each point of the 
diamond a plate will be /junk for 
each of the other classes holdiny
their reunions at this time, those . 
of 1913, 1918, 1923 and 1928. Event
ually every graduating class will 
have a marker.
This will be the first-part of v 
program beginning at 11 oclock 
Friday morning with a meeting o' 
the Alumni Federation in tlit
Trophy Room of the Gymnasium. 
Following the business of the day 
a luncheon will be given in the 
field house under Margaret Morri
son to the class of 1908,. with their 
husbands and wives. Dr. Baker 
is giving a lunch in his office in 
Administration Piali.
In the afternoon the homccomciH 
will be free to visit the school 
again. All the professors will have 
open house in their offices. Pupils 
grown old will be back to see the 
men who were once advisors, now 
perhaps business associates.
The evening will be given to the 
biggest Alrnni social affair ever 
attempted, the Cabaret Dance at 
Webster Hall. Music for the affair 
will be furnished all evening by 
the Collegiate Imps. The Old Col
legiate Six will be back to enter
tain. Several vaudeville acts have . 
been engaged from downtown thea
ters for the evening.. Webster Hall 
i.s moving its regular Friday night 
dance to the Venetian Room so 
that the main dining room may be 
left to the Carnegie revelers. There 
is room there for 350. In case a 
larger number reserve places for 
the evening adjoining rooms will 
be thrown open so .tjiat joy will 
not have to be confined. The affair 
will be strictly-for alumni. Reser
vations may be made by informing 
Miss Andrews. ^ The tickets are 
$2:50 each or $5 a couple.
The Pitt game will be bigger 
and better than ever since the 
Council of the City of Pittsburgh 
has set that date as Pittsburgh 
"Football Day. It will be an 
especially great day for Carnegie / 
alumni.
Heine Horsecollar Ceases Going To
General Assembly and Explains Why
Heinie Horsecollar has ceased 
attending General Assembly and he 
wants everyone to know, just why. 
Let it be known, lie explained 
in a statement to the press, that 
my decision is not the culmination 
of any petty tendencies founded 
upon inherent inertia, perpetual 
procrastination, or the languid lais
sez faire attitude which character
izes so many of our students, but 
results rather from a thorough con
sideration of the basic fundamen
tals' involving the reasons, pro
grams and results for and of Gen
eral Assemblies.
. Heinie, incidentally, hails from 
the fastnesses of Central Pa., where 
the well known Pennsylvania Dutch 
hang out and where the virile males 
have not yet adopted the fashion 
of rollfhg their hose. He is known 
to; the rustics as Pferdekragen, but 
upon reaching the local metropolis 
he found the English pseudonym 
Horsecollar preferable if less eupho
nious. He is well known about the 
campus through his activities as 
president of the debating club and
for the great-sincerity wfth which 
he has always attacked all prob
lems confronting him. His opppsition to the maxim "When on the 
campus act like, a Greek has oc
casionally subjected him to the 
criticism of being egocentric, bin 
his faithful attendance at general 
assemblies belies this. ^

and the cheering section serenely 
observes all with now and then a 
ripple of applause for some excep
tional work orf the part of either. 
When the tunes to Dear Old Tcch,
Fight For The Glcfry of Carnegie, 
or The Alma Mater arc played by 
the band, the students arc expected 
to sing; and if we arc to uphold 
the spirit of our Carnegie, wc must 
sing.
The cheering has been bad, to 
put it mildly. Wc start in the 
middle of a yell,v and by the time 
we arc through, half of the sec
tion has resumed its quiet con
templation of what is happening 
to that airplane flying so low over 
Homestead. Remember, the cheer
leaders are out there on the field 
to aid in starting the yells and 
keeping them to the right time, 
and if wc do not'help them, they 
and the band will have to go to 
the library where they can .hear 
some real noise.
Severe criticism has been pub
lished regarding the absence of the 
Plebe -snakc-dancc between halves. 
Let us stop and consider what 
a task it is to.get on or off the 
playing field from the well-situated 
cheering section. If the sopho
mores still insist in herding the 
Plebes to the field during that 
short ten minutes, I' would suggest 
that they equip themselves and the. 
snakc-dancers with vest-pocket edi
tion parachutes, or better yet-, 
wings, so that they, may leave the 
stands and return in the same day.
Fortunately, all is not lost. We 
have the Pitt and N. Y. U. games 
to which wc can look forward, and 
for which wc can make new resolu
tions. The Pitt "rooters arc get
ting better each year, and it is up 
to usto retain our reputation as 
being more enthusiastic and loyal 
than they. Attend the pep meet
ings and above all, give the .team 
your noise and moral sapport when 
they are out there fighting. Lets 
show our opponents that wc can 
still out-fight, out-play, and outcliecr; win or lose, and we will 
then be carrying on theSpirit of

Alumni Homecoming
NOTICE
ALUMNI
The purpose of this article is for 
your information on the status of 
the alumni with the Tartan. It 
has been the custom in former 
years and has .been continued for 
the first few issues of this year, 
to mail the Tartan to all paid-up 
alumni, but plans are now being 
made for some readjustment.
The Tartan staff of this year feels 
that it is impossible to continue on 
the present informal agreement 
made about eight years ago when 
the Tartan was a much smaller 
newspaper and the number of paid 
up alumni was also not as large 
as is now the case. This agree
ment was 'that for a cash sum of 
$700$400 being given by the Ath
letic Association and $300 by the 
administration through the budget 
of Mr. Beatty ,in the Employment 
Bureau, and work supplied by this 
bureau equivalent to the $100, the 
Tartan would be mailed to all paidi 
up alumni. This you will admit 
was.more of a gamble than' a busi
ness agreement as far as its con
tinuance was concerned, for it took 
into account no probability of inbeen carried on our budget appro' 
priation granted' through the Day' 
Student Council, although it-, was 
.not recognized as it was lost in 'the 
printing and mailing items of which 
no systematic analysis had been 
made before this year. It is im
possible to increase this budget 
over that of last year and due to 
the increased financial pressure 
caused by the improvements already 
stated we have been forced to stop 
all unnecessary expenses of .which 
this $600_is by far the largest 
Wc think that it is unjust for 
the day students, who at present 
are paying $1.70 a person per year 
for their Tartan when the alumni 
are receiving theirs at 38 cents a sub
scription. We recognize the fact 
that the Tartan is worth much 
more to a day student than to an 
alumnus, and do notadvocate an 
equal cost to both groups, but wc 
do feel that an adjustment should 
be madeso that the students do 
not have to be made to pay more 
than $1.50 each by carrying a bur
den justly due those who benefit 
by it. The $3.00 paid by you as 
alumni yearly dues is . used forprinting the Alumnus, maintaining 
the Alumni Office, and the balance 
is divided between the Alumni As
sociations of the various colleges 
and is used to support their activi
ties,, and nothing whatever is re
ceived by the Tartan from this 
source. Wc have found that the
creased number of paid up alumni i actual cost per alumni subscription 
or increased costs of the Tartan as | above all fixed charges is 66c. It
it grew from year to year. The 
basis on which we advocate a new 
agreement is that of a set price per 
subscription, based on actual cost 
figures, thus being fair to both 
parties and making this agreement 
so that it will not work a hardship 
on either group in years to come, 
and it will also 'put us in the posi
tion of being paid a set amount 
which is rightfully'due us for serv
ice rendered on each i subscription 
and will not place us Hn the posi
tion of asking, that We be placed on 
this and that budget for the next 
year and being made to feel that 
it was.a huge kindness being done 
just because wc had been given 
that amount the year before.
This has b.ce'n brought on by the 
increased cost entailed by addition
al improvements and new features 
that you probably have observed 
by this time. The size of the Tar
tan has been increased from a-six 
to an eight column page .which is 
standard newspaper size, a practice 
necessitated, first, by the increased 
volume of news, pictures *an4 fcamust be _ clearly understood that 
this only includes those costs which 
we are billed for, due to the in
creased number printed for the 
alumni and that the only benefit 
derived by the -Tartan is the satis 
faction of having a larger circu 
lation and keeping up our active 
contact with that group of. the 
school and in which wc ourselves 
will soon be members.
We hope that, you will under
stand that some adjustment must 
be made and there arc at present 
several plans up for consideration 
which arc as follows:
(1) That the present practice be
continued and that the increase 
over the $700 now received due To 
putting it on a subscription, basis 
at 66c each be. provided for by? 
(open for suggestions):_______
(2) That the present practice b 
discontinued and that those who 
want the Tartan be allowed to sub
scribe for it at $1.50 per year by 
mail.
(3) That tfic present practice be 
continued, and tabulate (a) thatture articles, sccond by the addition I Alumni dues be * raised to cover 
of our new rotogravure section, | the cost per subscription to the 
which is published by 1 lie. Campus Tartan (b) that the AdministraPictorial, a syndicate representing tion would contribute enough to 
the newspapers of the forty-five cover this cost (.1) for all alumni, 
largest and best colleges and uni(2) That the present practice beversities in the country, and 
printed only for the standard eight 
column paper; and .third, by the in
clusion of the Carnegie Plaid, the 
section devoted to the interest of 
the night students, which came 
about by a consolidation of the 
Skibp, (formerly published fourteen 
times a year by the administration 
for the night students) with the 
Tartan last spring. This was done 
with the intention of promoting the 
all-Carnegie spirit, in forming a 
bond of mutual interest between 
the day and night student group, 
in order to give night students an 
official weekly news medium sup
ported and supervised by their oywn 
Night Student Council; as well as 
in order to make the Tartan a 
larger, better and more interesting 
newspaper. This consolidation, by 
the way, increased the average cir
culation of the Tartan to 9,000 
copies weekly, making it one of the 
largest collegiate newspapers in the 
country.
Getting down to actual facts wc 
have the Tartan carrying a six 
hundred dollar burden, due to the 
alumni subscription list, (rhc ^^st 
of the Tartan mailed to alumni for 
one year is nearly $1300. This only 
indues those costs due to increased 
amount of paper used, hours of 
presswork, and mailing charges for 
that number, and includes none of 
the fixed charges of publication 
whatsoever. We have been receiv
ing four hundred dollars from the 
Athletic Association through the
kindness of Buddy Overcnd, in 
continuing this appropriation sincc 
the time that he paid this amount 
to the Taran for publicity on the 
Athletic Association Drive for
funds conducted some years ago(
and which is getting harder for
him to keep' on his budget each 
year, also $300 through Mr. Beat
tys budget in the Employment 
Bureau of the Institute. These 
two amounts have been credited 
towards the $1300, item mentioned 
above and the remaining $600 has
using the* Tartan as a medium of 
contact and keeping up of alumni 
interest in the institution, which is 
especially advantageous to them in 
view of the fact that they-are try
ing to raise a four million dollar 
endowment fund by 1946 and need 
the active support of all tlieir 
alumni.
This article has been written.in 
order to inform you of existing 
conditions and that some form of 
change is necessitated. We would 
be glad to have letters commenting 
on the above plans or suggesting 
new ideas for .the handling of this 
matter. They will be published on 
this page if desired. Some decision 
must be made Within the next few 
weeks and we are quite anxious in 
making this to satisfy all concerned 
and promote at the same time the 
unified Carnegie spirit.

PITTSBURGH ISSUE OF
PUPPET TO BE OUT
(Continued from. Page 1) 
find will be given due .space.
The Puppet will conduct a novel 
contest beginning with the Thanks
giving issue. This contest will be 
waged among the four sororities in 
the Art school. A prize of $50 is 
to be awarded to the sorority 
which sells the most copies of the 
five -issues of the Puppet, begin
ning with the Thanksgiving num
ber.
Only three days remain ^before 
the opening of the Sccond Annual 
Alumni Homccoming. This affair, 
which promises to be the biggest 
alumni event ever held at Carnegie, 
is one which will be well worth 
the time and money spent.
Although plans have not been 
changed to any great extent, they 
have been approved and tlic work 
of carrying out the various plans 
has been started.
The reservations for the class 
banquets, Cabaret Dinner Dance, 
and the Pitt game have been pour
ing in to the Alumni and Gradu
ate Managers Offices.
Everyone should have their reser
vations made before coming back 
to school in order to be sure of a 
place at all of these events. To 
miss one or any of the events on 
the program will be a catastrophe 
for any real Carnegie man or 
woman.
Never before in your history as 
alumni have you had such op
portunities to enjoy yourselves. 
The size of preparations is much 
greater than that of any previous 
alumni program.
Plans for the Cabaret Dinner 
Dancc arc coming along fine. Final 
arrangements have been made. The 
decorations and favors have been 
secured and a colorful and noisy 
time will be had by all. The Col
legiate Imps will play the dance 
music. The Collegiate six and tlic 
Oriental Orchestra, two old favor
ites, will entertain the crowd be
tween dances.
Aside from the other numbers 
on the program which were de
scribed in last weeks issue, a new 
number has been arranged. Two 
night student alumni, Paul Craw
ford and William Pilich, will enter
tain with a dancc, Adagio Pilcra. 
Many other alumni and students 
will help with the entertainment. 
All in all, it promises to be one 
big affair.
Remember that the dancc is in
formal. This is for the benefit 
of out-of-town alumni who would 
not want to bring formal clothes 
along with them. Also, you can 
come alone. Many men and wom
en have1 planned to return in 
groups and intend to go to the 
Dinner Dance with the same 
crowd. So, if you arc coming 
back alone, dont let that keep you 
from attending the dancc, for as 
soon as you get there, you will 
find many old friends to cat and 
dancc with.
Another thing to remember is 
that the Cabaret Dinner - Dance is 
a full evenings entertainment 
from seven until midnight, and wc 
have heard that, it may last long
er. Who knows? No want will 
want to leave until he is pushed 
out of the doors of Webster Hall. 
We absolutely guarantee to satis
fy or your money back. What could 
be more fair than that?
A record breaking crowd' is pre
dicted from the sale of tickets to 
date, so that to insure yourselves-, 
of a seat in the main'dining room ' 
of Webster Hall right next to the 
orchestra, mail your order in to
day. Yesterday or last week would 
have been much better.
The reunion jjgjlunclieons, which 
have been planned will, also be 
worthy of attention from all mem
bers of reuniting .classes. This 
event takes place only once in 
every five years, and. no alumni 1 
should ever miss it. This years I 
reunions havebeen planned a long 
time in advance, and the commit-! 
tecs have promised succcssful 
luncheons.
The Pitt game, the crowning 
event of the Homccoming, prom
ises to be an interesting game. If 
any guesses are allowed, wc would 
say that you will sec a victorious 
Carnegie eleven. This event docs 
not happen very often, so dont 
miss it. The tickct sale for the j 
game., has been very, large and in 
order to secure a scat inside the 
stadium you should have your tick-! 
ct order in several days before the I 
game.
This event will be talked 'of for( 
years, so don't make a mistake by' 
being among those who arc miss-1 
ing when your class roll call is I 
made. There will never be anj 
other Second Annual Alumni |

Gentlemen:
I have used Edgeworth Smoking 
Tobacco for the past twenty-five years.
Two years ago I took my trusty briar 
along on a trip abroad, intending to 
revel in the delights of the famous 
mixtures in London. I confess that I 
did not. carry along with me any of the 
little blue tins of Edgeworth. But the 
joke was on me. I went back to Edgeworth, only this time I had to pay 45c 
for a 15c tin of Edgeworth!
Incidentally, on a trip through 
England and later through Ireland, I 
was surprised to find the wide distribu
tion and ready sale of Edgeworth in 
Great Britain. A frequent and famil
iar sign in Dublin, Cork and other 
cities in Ireland was a white streamer 
announcing a new shipment of Edgeworth. To make such a conquest in 
the home of smoking tobacco must be 
very gratifying to your house.

New Parking
Regulations Issued
Night Students Requested to  
Co-operate
For the benefit of those who did 
not receive a copy of the TARTAN 
containing the new parking regu
lations, wc arc printing this article 
again.
Perhaps about the best way to 
introduce this very vexatious ques
tion to the night student body at 
large is to print two letters which 
arc about as complete on this sub
ject as can be:
Dear Mr. Orbin:
It is getting near time for the 
fall registration, and with a desire 
to help the parking situation along 
J am writing for some informa
tion tclativc to the plans you have 
maft, how the parking is to be 
done, ctc. A great deal of con
fusion exists every year and if a 
little advance information was 
available, perhaps some of it could 
be avoided.There is another point I would 
like to mention, and that is police 
protection. The past year quite 
an amount of automobile equip
ment was purloined and in several 
instances cars were jacked up and 
the tires removed from the stustudents cars. It is not a very 
pleasant experience to come out 
from the class room, say at 9:30 
or 10:30 p. m. and find that your 
means of convcyancc has been tam
pered with and you arc forccd to 
get home the best way you can, 
mayhaps to Ambridgc, Tarcntum, 
Woodlawn, or some of the other 
suburban points and no mode of 
transportation available. Is it not 
possible to secure some manner of 
police protection?
Awaiting with interest your re
ply, I remain,
Sincerely,
E. E. McDonald.
NIGHT STUDENT
CARNEGIE HANDBOOK
F. V. GOLITZ, Editor-in-chief
Wc arc proud of this little book, 
and justly so. It is a very com
plete manual for the night student 
and necessitated a great deal of 
work in compiling it.
F. V. Golitz was the Editor-inChief and to him wc all owe a 
great deal of thanks. He has left 
nothing undone to meet all the 
needs of our organization. He 
demonstrated his ability in the pub
lishing world in a very admirable 
way. The Council congratulates 
him on his efforts.
Two other members of the Coun
cil who should receive recognition 
for their artistic ability arc J. H. 
Sansonctti and T. E. Parlcttc, both 
of the College of Fine Arts, who 
made sketches used in the book.
In the distribution of these books 
Mr. Golitz was assisted by W. R. 
Hoddcr, E. J. Molyncaux, P. J. 
Stupka, S. O. Hough, J. E. Storch, 
D. E. South, T. V. Klinefelter, J. 
F. DeSamonc and J. H. .Sansonctti.
It was not possible to get a 
handbook to every one who regis
tered on the first three nights of 
registration although we endeavor
ed to do so. To enable those who 
have not secured their copy, pro
vision has been made to have them 
procurc it from the Cashiers Office 
by presenting their yellow registra
tion card.
I take this occasion to thank 
these students for their unselfish 
assistance in helping to distribute 
these books.

 Mr. Orbin replied as follows: 
Dear Mr. McDonald:
I have your communication of 
Julv 14 in reference to parking and 
police protection.
The parking regulations arc, in 
effect, as follows: No cars arc to
be parked in the central driveway 
of the Campus between the flash
lights. On the street adjacent to 
the park all cars arc to be parked 
at right angles with the rear to 
the parkas a matter of safety. 
No parking is permitted on the 
opposite side of the street. There 
are no other,, restrictions on the 
ground except the ordinary com
mon sense regulations at curves.
As to police protection, I am 
"orry that wc arc unable to do 
. nything along thisline. Quite a 
number of complaints have been 
made about cars and parts having 
been stolen in daylight. In fact, 
several cars and parts have been 
stolen on the road directly outside 
my office window. They will even 
.steal cars parked in front of the 
Police Department. Unless you 
would happen to sec some one 
snapping off the lock of a machine, 
it would be very difficult to tell 
who the owner of the car is. About 
11 o'clock one morning last spring 
the writer saw two boys who 
looked suspicious working on a car 
and was informed that they were 
students of the Automobile Dept, 
which proved to be the ease. The 
lack of proper punishment seems 
to be the cause of the continuance 
of this ever-present evil.
' Yours very truly,
Frank Orbin,
Business Manager.
Since the time these two let
ters wefe written the major groups, 
i. e., the Facult)r Welfare Com
mittee and the two Student Coun
cils, after considerable thought, 
have dccidcd to lend all their 
moral forcc to make a successful 
campaign of this question. Cards 
are to be printed and placed in 
the parked automobiles outlining 
the manner of parking and request 
for co-operation.
The regulations require that cars 
be parked on the Schenley side of 
the street only, and at right angles 
with the curb. Students are urged 
to park as close to neighboring 
machines as is reasonably possible, 
in this way more space will be pro
vided for parking cars. Students 
arc likewise urged to show some 
consideration for their fellow drivers.
The Night Student Council has 
had this question up for debate 
for several years, particularly last 
year when it authorized its presi
dent to solicit the Administration 
for assistance.
Now that some definite program 
is decided upon and we know 
where we stand let's all lend a 
helping hand to make a go of the 
new parking regulations.

THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF 
A NEW NIGHT STUDENT
For two years I had passed Car
negie many times, usually in the 
evening when the students who 
attended night school were arriv
ing for classes. I marvelled at the 
number of fellows who sacrificing 
their evenings of pleasure on the 
altar of Education, were in attend
ance, and I wonderedwhy?
But that was two years ago. 
Only two weeks ago I joined their 
ranks. And if you think Im sorry 
1 did join, ask me. To be per
fectly rank, I think it was one 
of the best moves of my life. My 
first impressions were many and 
varied, which I think was the same 
with all of you first-year men.
Those who were in the Indus
tries Building for registration must 
have been as much impressed as 
I was by the manner in which 
those few professors extracted or
der out of chaos.
There was quite a crowd of us, 
as anyone at the end of the line 
will testify, and wc all had ques
tions to ask. And did the pro
fessors tire of the interminable 
barrage? They didnt. I am 
sure that the fellows like myself 
who had never had aiiy contact 
with Carnegie before, wec more 
than pleased at the courteous and 
efficient treatment accorded them, 
And it was the same at the cash
iers Office across the street Avhcrc 
our hard-earned shekels winged 
their way into the maw of the 
cash box. But efficient, say, it 
worked like a machine. No rush
ing or hurrying as one would ex
pect, but just a quiet even method 
of doing business in a way that 
we all like.
And the first class! I warrant 
you that I for one felt so out of 
placc that a little twinge of home
sickness assailed me. But wc were 
all strangers and the prof. didnt 
look any too agreeable so we all 
revolved our troubles in our own 
minds and said nothing. But the 
sccond night together was quite 
different, indeed. I found that at 
least five-sixths of the best fel
lows in .town went to Carnegie, 
the other sixth being the faculty.
Now, however, wc arc used to 
one another. We talk over school 
matters on our way home, we mix 
freely with the bunch and even 
arc so familiar as to bum cigarets, 
That makes me feel as though 
they were old friends. In fact, 
some of them arc and dont let 
anyone tell you that wc arc not 
satisfied. We sometimes growl 
about this or that, but when it 
comes to a real showdown the 
growls turn into songs of praise.
It is surprising that some of us 
would rather attend class than 
spend an evening in any other 
manner, but when one considers 
that after a few classes we be
come acclimated and that what I 
consider the finest grind is just 
in its inception.
Wc fully realize that this grind 
will not be a path of roses, but 
after due deliberation we are sure 
that we shall feel the benefits from 
our first contact with Carnegie as 
the years roll byour education 
and our friends.

Service Tends to Eliminate Confuj

Well, the mad rush is over and 
we arc all registered for the first 
semester at least. From present 
indications wc arc going to have a 
larger enrollment this year than 
ever, Any one who was out the 
first three or four nights realizes 
what a task the administration had 
before them.
Several night students assisted in 
the registration, among whom 
were J. E. Storch. W. H. McRobcrts, T. C. Kindle, E. T. Davis, 
P. J. Stupka, W. R. Hoddcr, E. J. 
Molyncaux, S. O. Hough from the

Arts School; D. E. South, T. V. 
Klinefelter, C. H. Flemming and 
F. V. Golitz from the Industries 
School.
Realizing these students deserve 
the thanks of the general night 
student body, I am prompted to 
express a word of commendation.
To those students who assisted 
at registration time, I wish to ex
tend, on behalf of the night stu
dents, a word of appreciation for 
the co-opcration and assistance 
rendered at this trying time. You 
can be assured that any kindness 
or courtcsy your presence made 
possible was of great help in locat
ing and satisfying students who 
were in doubt.

TREACLE AND MUSH
There are demagogues on the 
college lecture platform as well as 
on _ the political stump. At Yale 
University, scene of the well ad
vertised Tunncy lecture, on Shakes
peare, an undergraduate has writ
ten a vigorous article for the Lit 
on the demagogues of the English 
department. He says:
"With the twentieth century and 
the gold rush for highfer educa
tion, the greatly increased nonacademic students, who represent
ed the driving forcc of America 
the unintellcctual but powerful 
middle classesbegan to influence 
and mold the weaker academic 
forces, which represented only a 
European .. culture that had never 
been wholly vital on this side # of 
the Atlantic. From this' period 
dates the ascendancy of English in 
the curriculum, an ascendancy that 
was caused by tlic fact that more 
than any other subject' it was able 
to be taught in a manner, attrac
tive to the student. Literature be
ing an art, it is comparatively easy 
for the professors to dodge the 
facts therein and play, up the more 
exciting romantic aspect of the 
subject. Thus, * better than the 
rest, the subject of English fitted 
in with the progress from a ra
tional, impersonal, largely factual 
presentation towards a more per
sonal, emotional, and vaguely cul
tural presentation  a progress 
which was inevitable if the curri
culum was to be sold to the stu
dents, since the most cffectivc way 
to sell a subjcct is to soft-pedal 
the intellectual aspect, pull out the 
vox humana, and unroll the 
American flag. English, in fact, 
almost sells itself; the teacher 
merely turns the faucet and the 
treacle and mush come . gushing 
forth. The time has come, how
ever, to examine with some care 
the highly developed sales tech
nique of our leading vendors of 
English, to snip off with the shears 
of reason a few of the wildly wav
ing locks of our romantic Samson.
The basis of the present meth
od of teaching. English at Yale is 
an appeal to the emotions rather 
than to reason. The structure 
which has been reared on this 
foundation is a gorgeous, cloudcapped  vision of loveliness, per
haps, but I cannot help wondering 
in my prosaic way if the house is 
builded on rock or on sand. In an 
effort to discover just what arc the 
underpinnings of this Prospcros 
palace, I have lately asked a good 
many of our1 English teachers what 
they consider thegoal of their 
teaching. The answer, differently 
phrased each time but always the 
same in essence, has been, -"the 
stimulation of interest in the sub
ject. However plausible at first 
glance this may sound, on closer 
examination certain serious weak
nesses appear. The dictionary de
fines stimulant as an excitant or 
intoxicant. It is much easier to 
excite, intoxicate, or stimulate a 
group of people through an appeal 
to their emotions than through an 
appeal to their intellectsit makes 
no essential difference whether the 
subjcct about which one is excit
ing them is English or mother 
love. It being, then, easier to 
stimulate through the emotions, 
and the acknowledged aim of our 
teachers of English beinsc the stim
ulation of interest, does it not 
follow that the teaching methods 
in English will rely mainly on the 
emotional appeal? One has only 
to consider the most popular Eng
lish teachers now at Yale to real
ize that this final step, which pro
ceeds logically from the stimulat
ing fallacy, has been taken.
Well, did you see the game last 
Saturday? If not, you missed a 
real treat. It was everything a 
game should be and we finally 
managed to break the jinx. Be
cause the score was 19-0 it was no 
indication that we ran away with 
thorn, as it was anything but a 
set-up. Incidentally this seems to 
be the winning combination for 
Carnegie. Remember Notre Dame? 
However, to get back on the main 
tract again, W. & J. was touted as 
not being up to the standard of 
others. Well, perhaps they werent, 
but from my viewpoint it appeared 
as thought Carnegie improved con
siderably, which accounted more 
for our success than W. & J.s sup
posedly weakness.
As usual Harpster and Karcis 
were the outstanding stars for Car
negie. It will be a mighty diffi
cult task to fill Harpsters shoes 
when he graduates. He is, indeed, 
one of the few quarterbacks play
ing the game today who displays 
the tendency o mixing the plays 
up without any apparent signals 
from the bench. Space does not 
permit mentioning the names ' of 
the entire team, which should be 
done were it desirable to . give 
credit for the victory. Wc should 
not, however, overlook two boys 
of our opponents who played in a 
most satisfactory manner, namely, 
Douds and Aschmann, who gave 
their all until it was a physical 
impossibility for them to continue.
Those low rumblings, emanating 
from Industries and Engineering 
are in connection with the elec
tions scheduled for this week. Sev
eral boys have mentioned that they 
were not satisfied as regards the 
method of challenging the nomi
nees in Engineering last year. 
They tell me it was made to ap
pear as though one had to be an 
engineering student for at least 
two years before being eligible to 
hold office. Now this doesnt 
sound so good and I am hoping 
that tliosc who told me this were 
inclined to have misunderstood. As 
recalled by the writer the only
FORGETFULNESS, LAZINESS-, 
OR INDIFFERENCE
"It is alarming to note the ex
cuses that students have when it 
comes to shouKlcring a; little re
sponsibility.; 
This quotation and the heading 
of this editorial was copied from 
another college publication. It is 
a:> true in this school as in that 
one. . i.
At such a university as this 
ciiticism has been made that stu
dents arc placed too much on their 
ownthat they are responsible to 
ncone but themselves. In too 
many cases this has bred a sense 
ci irresponsibility to everyonein
cluding themselves. It was never 
intended that men should work in 
that way in an intimate society 
and where they have attempted to 
do so the experiment has resulted 
itdisaster. Many students arc too 
unsystematic, immature, forgetful, 
or indifferent to do much without 
constant prodding.
All of us at times arc forgetful 
and indifferent, all have our lazy 
periodsbut in many cases, it is 
merely a temporary affliction re
sulting from previous intense ef
forta sort of reaction. If seldom 
enough, these periods arc stimulat
ing. It is the same principle that 
business men work on when they 
take a two-weeks rest.
The chronic loafer, the man who 
forgets his assignments, ^ the man 
who doesnt care what his assign
ments arcthey have their place 
somewhere, but it is not on a uni
versity campus.
Responsibility breeds character. 
A man who has always had some
one to tell him just what to do, 
to look out for him all the time 
will be hard put to it when he 
has to shift for himself. The man 
whose adoring mother always 
thought for him, whose father pro
tected him, whose brother looked 
out for himis the man who needs 
a roommate when lie leaves home 
for school, to get him to class in 
the morning, to see that he baths, 
studies and sends his laundry out 
at regular intervals. He is the 
one who will never amount to 
anything because he never knew 
the rigors of responsibility.
Students -who are forgetful, lazy 
or indifferent are getting little for 
what they spend to go to college. 
A man has a golden opportunity 
to learn what responsibility can 
mean at a university.

stipulation required for nominees 
for school offices is that only those 
who arc regularly registered night 
students and have paid the. night 
student activity fee and have been 
on the campus for two full years 
aro eligible. If a man has taken 
the General Studies course in In

is up to you all to see that you 
have some say as to how these ac
tivities are to be handled. The 
men who arc elected are respon

in order to do the work conscien

are. willing to devote their time

there is also an entertainment pro

and it made the fellows pretty 
sore. One of these nights some 
one will conceive the bright idea 
of doing something rash to make 
them stop, and then, of course, the 
P. R. Co. will be up in arms 
against us, whereas it will be. their 
own fault. If they cant make 
money and give service, then why 
not let someone else in and try 
it. Here's one for the N. S. C. 
to handle, and every student who 
uses  the street cars will wait with 
interest the answer to their prayer: 
Oh, please, make the street cars 
stop at Morewood avenue.
Last Saturday was Ma and Pa 
day. Many parents apparently 
took advantage of the day and 
came out to sec what their chil
dren were doing in college. Well* 
they picked tlic worst day of all, 
because all they saw them doing1 
was yelling their heads off all aft
ernoon and then doing these fool 
dancc steps all evening (yours 
truly was doing them, too). They 
should have picked any other night 
but Saturday and then the children 
would have been busy studying. 
Now you tell one.

N. S. C. Treasurer Gives a Logical 
Explanation of an .Apparent 
Discrepancy 
The September issue of the 
Skibo contained an article to the 
effect that the Night Students 
gave $1,028 to the Endowment 
Fund. The financial summary of 
the Night Student Council as pub
lished in the Night Student Car
negie Handbook on ftagc 30 and
also printed in the September is
sue of the Skibo shows the amount 
donated to the Endowment Fund 
and Student Welfare (Shelter Pa
vilion and Activities Building) . to 
be $1.021.36, a difference of $6.85, 
which is explained in the follow
ing manner.
The financial summary balance 
is as of June 30, whereas the
news item from the Cashiers Of
fice is of a later date and con
tained the donation from two addi
tional students of $6.83 to this 
fund, which addition has not as 
yet been'deposited in our account. 
Any one familiar with the com
piling of a report of this nature 
knows a certain time has to be 
taken for a working basis and any 
subsequent additions or subtrac
tions will be taken into considera
tion in .the next report.
Both of these amounts are cor
rect and the $6.85, which, by the 
way, was for the Endowment Op
tion, will be turned over to the 
administration in the near future, 
and accounted for in the next fi
nancial summary.

ABOUT PIPES
This is the age of wonders. 
Consequently we do not always 
appreciate the ordinary appearing 
objects that enter our everyday 
life. An instance of this is a pipe. 
How many of us really appreciate 
our pipes? Are we not prone to 
think of them as just an ordinary 
piece of wood made for the pur
pose of holding tobacco.
If you arc so inclined to think 
this way, you are all wrong as 
your pipe is one of the best friends 
you have. Who is it that is al
ways beside you when you study, 
or read, or work, or play, or mo
tor. Why, your pipe, of course, 
and it is your pipe that makes 
whatever you arc doing so much 
easior to do and in the long run 
gives you a zest for doing it.
Did you ever hear of a fellow 
thinking of his girl when lie didnt 
have his pipe? Of course not, be
cause is not the smoke from the 
pipe rcquird'cl to form an outline of 
her before lie can really and truly 
think of her. When you see pic
tures of batchelors in their som
ber times, they must havea.pipe 
in their mouth with the smoke 
forming an outline of a girl be
fore the picture is complete. A 
pipe imparts to a man something 
that nothing else can and even in 
this modern age, it has remained 
the one obstacle that the female of 
the specic has not been able to 
overcome.
Surely, this one thing alone 
would appeal to any man in this 
way that it is the one thing re
maining masculine. They may 
drink our gin, smoke our cigarets, 
wear our knickcrs, but they can't 
smoke our pipes, especially if the 
pipe lias, seen any kind of service 
at all. So lets bring, out the 
pipes.

waukee, manufactured gas is used

Alumni to Hold Cabaret 
Dance At Webster Hall
On Friday, October 26, the eve 
of the Carnegie-Pitt football game, 
the biggest alumni dance ever held 
will take place at Webster Hall. 
The afTair is to be a dinner dance 
in Cabaret style, and will last until 
twelve o'clock. The Collegiate 
Imps will furnish the music, with 
the old Collegiate Six back to play 
the same old familiar pieces. Spe
cial features will include Obie New
man, who will sing for the guests 
vaudeville stunts from a downtown 
theater, and group singing of all 
of old Carnegie songs.
Webster Hall has co-operated 
with the Alumni Association by 
moving its regular Friday night 
dance to the Venetian Room, so 
that the Cabaret dance may be 
strictly for alumni in the main din
ing hall.
The alumni has been most active 
this past year. ' Recently an an
nouncement was given out of a 
number of scholarships that are 
to be sponsored by the Alumni 
Association.

These honorary cadet commis

girls and the affair is becoming 
one of tht most, outstanding of 
the school year.
It has become customary to in
stall these officers at a short but 
'mpressive ceremony during the 
Military Ball. This function is 
usually held as near Armistice Day 
as is possible, and this year is to 
be held on November 9th.
At the ceremony the girls are 
presented with their commissions 
and the insignia of their rank arc 
tinned on their shoulders.
The ROTC students will srote 
next Thursday but the results will 
not be announced until the night 
of the ball. The practice of ap
pointing honorary officers is carried 
on in varied forms by almost all 
of the military schools and organ
izations in the country. The pracMcb is permanent at Carnegie Tech

PROF. GUSTAFSON TALKS 
TO MAIL AD CONVENTION
The Printing Department of Car
negie Tech was represented by 
Professor Gustafson, head of the 
department, at the Direct Mail 
Advertising Convention held in 
Philadelphia last Thursday. Those 
present were very enthusiastic over 
the progress that direct mail ad
vertising has made in the past few 
years.
After the convention Professor 
Gustafson went up to Boston and 
made an address before a meeting 
of the Employing Bookbinders of 
America. Among the displays that 
were Shown at this meeting was 
an exhibit of bookbinding done by 
the students of Carnegie which re
ceived very favorable comment.
On November 13 the Annual 
Educational Night in Baltimore will 
be held at the Batlimore Club of 
Printing House Craftsmen under 
the auspices of the Ottmorc Mcrgenthaler Linotype School of that 
city. Professor Gustafson will be 
one of the principal speakers of 
the evening. Last year this event 
proved to be the biggest in the 
city on the printers calendar for 
that year. Baltimore is a center of 
printing enthusiasm and offers fine 
facilities for holding such an 
event.
The Printing Department of this 
school has made an addition of 
three part-time instructors this year 
due to the expansion of the depart
ment. H. H. YVisncr is assisting 
Mr. Gress in the instruction of 
typography in the night school. 
C. W. Pitkin is assistant to Mr. 
Lane in teaching linotype com
position to the night students. The 
third new instructor is E. F. Rittman, who is assisting Mr. Thomas, 
the prcsswork instructor. Mr. Rittman teaches platen presswork tothe night school students. Mr. 
Wisner and Mr. Pitkin arc both 
registered day students in the 
Printing Department.
The United Typothetae of Amer
ica is sponsoring a contest for all 
advanced students in printing. A 
prize is offered for-the best de
signed bookplate to be used in 
the new' Unit Library for Print
ers.
The Senior class in Advanced 
English' for Printers has already 
made plans for the publication of 
the 1929 number of' the Bagpipe, a 
Senior class project in printing. 
The Bagpipe took a slump sev
eral years ago but was revived 
last year and now promises to 
carry on successfully.
Ail extensive series of lectures 
is being planned for this year cov
ering the various fields of printing. 
This plan was carried out to some 
extent last year with great suc
cess. The printing students were 
able to hear several prominent 
speakers last year on printing and 
its allied industries. Some of the 
lectures this year will be open to 
the public.

BLASTERS HANDBOOK
PRIMING a dynamite cartridge seems like a 
very simple job when you watch a profes
sional blastera thrust into the cartridge, a 
blasting cap crimped onto the fuse and inserted 
into the hole, and the fuse tied to the cartridge 
with a piece of twine.
But each of these apparently simple steps requires experi
enced handling for the sake of efficiency and safety. Upon 
proper priming depends complete detonation, avoiding the 
pulling out of detonator, guarding against moisture, easy 
and safer loading of bore holes. There are two methods of 
detonating a chargesafety fuse and blasting cap or electric blasting caps.
Each step of the several methods of priming a cartridge ia 
fully explained in classroom terms and clearly illustrated in 
Chapter Two of the Blasters' Handbook.
The entire Handbook, in fact, is one of the practical reference 
and study works found in the classrooms ofleading technical 
schools, colleges and universities. Written out of the expe
rience of du Pont field service men over a great many years 
and taken from all fields. Meaty, well arranged, and con
densed into handy pocket size.

am not going any morel
What?
Im not going any more. Why, 
remember the last one before that. 
When I got there, there were an 
odd hundred Plcbcs in the bal
cony, about thirty upperclassmen 
downstairs and some girls. The 
president rose to announce that 
Beta Pi Kappa was about to make 
its customary call and introduced 
someone who would explain why. 
This fellow then introduced another 
even less distinguished appearing 
bird who started calling names. In 
the meantime half the gang down
stairs had climbed up on the stage 
and the rest followed one by one 
to have their hands shaken while 
the Plebcs and the girls clapped.
"I was the only man left down
stairs. The speaker looked at me 
and then everybody else did. He 
scrutinized his list but couldnt 
find my name so lie sat down with 
a sigh and Kappa Pi Beta slipped 
off the stage and out the side door 
when they thought no one was 
looking. Then the lights went out 
and Professor Cod gave an illus
trated lecture telling about his 
troubles in South Africa which the 
plebes seem,ed to think was funny, 
though I dont see just why. When 
the lights were turned on again I 
was the only audience left besides 
the president and since then I 
have been thinking.
Marvelous, we muttered from 
the forcc of habit, and the crux 
of your cogitations provokes your 
present abstinence.
HuhOh yes. Now why werent 
there .more students there?
We give up.
Because they werent interested. 
Why werent you there? Because 
you werent interested! Ana wliy 
not? The speakers arc always 
goodyoull admit that.
"Yes, dubiously.
Well thenheres the dope. You 
have lectures in Physics, Chcmistrjr, Economics several times a 
week besides all kinds of talks in 
recitations arid labs, and naturally 
with so many elevating ideas 
thrown at you, you miss half of 
them. So when you hear that 
Herman H. Blah is going to dis
cuss the Decentralization of Indus
try at assembly you rush to the 
Commons to get a good place in 
line and work the cross word puz
zle. It's just too much of a good 
thing. ' You want to relax and 
they offer you a talk which bene
fits no one but the press bureau. 
But assemblies bring the stu
dents together.
They dont. Not nearly to the 
degree that the Commons does. 
In the first place students dont 
come around, and those there can 
only sec those in front of them, 
unless they are impolite enough 
to risk wrenching their necks, and 
even then what good will that do? 
The only' spirit that pervades the 
bod}7 is one of impending sleep 
and. the only common desire is 
that to keep awake. Of course 
then there is the moral uplift of 
knowing you did the right thing 
when it was disagreeable, just like 
kissing Aunt Anna and playing 
with her kid. 
Do you want to discontinue as
semblies. That.
"Certainly not. But make them 
attractive. You never heard of any
one being too tired to go to Rose 
Marie or the Science Stag. Dont 
try to educate the students at as
semblies. They carry 54 units for 
that already. Amuse them, enter
tain them; dont make them think, 
but arrange a program where they 
can dream and laugh and let their 
imagination run wild without 'a 
single serious thought. The stu
dents nepd relaxation and in a 
technical school there must be the 
necessary supply of talent if it 
exists anywhere.
One of the most pleasing musical 
events of the season will be the 
concert to be given by Mme.

nology, is a young concert singer 
whose voice displays a great talent 
and her ease in handling the dif
ficult program is evidence that her 
technical training is sound. An 
effective stage presence and . charm 
of manner assisted her in winning 
the hearts of her audience.
In the group of French songs 
she was especially attractive to her 
audience in The Bluebird of Dalcroze, a modern French composer. 
The first section of her program 
was closed with Mozarts Recita
tive cd aria Non mi dir," and ex
tremely difficult Eighteenth Cen
tury Italian selection in which the 
full range of her voice and the 
pyrotechnics of vocal music were 
employed.
Matthew Frey, a leader in the 
musical world of Pittsburgh, ac
companied Miss McGrail at the 
piano. Mr. Frey captivated the 
fancies of the audience with a 
group of piano solos which em
braced an extremely .wide scope 
from Eighteenth Century com
posers to the present day Polichiriclle" of Rachmaninoff. Other 
numbers in the group were the 
Fantasia in D minor of Mozart 
and the Etude, Opus 25, No. 12" 
of Chopin.

vocal music at Duqucsnc Univer

Germany, F. G. Tryon of the U. 
S. Bureau of Mines and others.
Approximately sixty of the one 
hundred and three speakers who 
will participate in the proceedings 
will come from outside of the 
United States. Germany will have 
the largest delegation with more 
than twenty of her most distin
guished scientists and engineers in 
attendance. France, England, and 
Canada will also be represented by 
a number of fuel technologists. 
Other countries that will be repre
sented on the program of speakers 
are Russia, Italy, Japan, Austria. 
Denmark, Belgium, and Jugo-Slavia, 
In addition delegates have been ap
pointed to represent governments 
and scientific organizations in Chile, 
Cuba, Czecho-Slovakia, Norway, 
Poland, Rumania and Spain.
The purpose of th Coal Con
ference this year, like that of the 
one which took place at Carnegie 
Tech in 1926 when 1500 scientists 
from the United States and 15 
foreign countries gathered together 
in the first meeting of the kind 
ever held, is to bring together the 
distinguished specialists in the many 
fields of fuel technology from all 
over the world. The Conference 
will discuss only the purely sci
entific aspects of the coal industry; 
the labor question will be avoided; 
the economics of the industry will 
not be touched on; no attempt to 
explain the present state of coal 
mining or any program for its 
adoration will be attempted.
Papers by distinguished scientist 
will tell what has been done in the 
way of clanging the soft coal, 
which can be bought in Pittsburgh 
for less, than two dollars a ton, 
into various valuable commodities. 
One of the most interesting papers 
will be read by Krauch, director 
of the great German Dye Trust, 
who will relate what has been ac
complished in liquefying coal, and 
transmitting it into substitutes for 
wood' alcohol, petroleum, gasoline, 
benzine, paraffin, etc.

Dr. Goldenson To Speak
At Second Chapel, Oct. 30Tau Beta Pi to Hold
Snvoker Tomorrow
The second chapel of the year 
is to be held Tuesday, October 30, 
at 11:30 in the Little Theatre. The 
Rev. Samuel H. Goldenson of the 
Rodcf Shalom Congregation has 
been invited to deliver the address. 
Organ selections will be offered by 
Frederich Chapman and vocal num
bers by Paul Brautieam.
Dr. Goldenson is an interesting 
speaker and very popular with the 
student body, having spoken at a 
number of previous chapels, not 
to mention many other special oc
casions. The artists at the chapel 
will be men who are well known 
and about the campus aiTd 
vicinity. Paul Brautigam is the 
Student Director of the Mens Glee 
Club and Frederich Chapman, who 
has played at a number of ohapels, 
is a member of the Music Depart
ment of the Arts School. A de
lightful program is promised and 
it is hoped that the attendance 
will be as satisfactory as that of 
the first chapel.
There is some possibility that 
Dr. Goldenson may be unable to 
speak at chapel, in which event, 
another minister will be procured.
R. Byrd Carries 780,000
Cigarettes On Pole Trip
How many cigarettes a day docs 
a man smoke when the thermome
ter reads sixty below zero?
Evidently Commander Richard E. 
Byrd figured it out, for Liggett & 
Myers Tobacco Company received 
an order for 780,000 Chesterfield 
cigarettes,-which arc now on their 
way to the South Pole in the ships, 
of the Byrd Antartic Expedition. 
The basis for this order was prob
ably arrived at during the long 
wait for . good weather in the 
Spitzbergen camp preceding Byrds 
flight over the North Pole; they 
just ate up cigarettes in those 
days, according to a member of 
the party.
The question of which cigarettes 
to choose was likewise answered 
from experience. Expedition head
quarters questioned members, and 
when a majority of Byrds 'picked 
men expressed a preference for 
Chesterfield, a two year's supply 
of that brand was ordered, in addi
tion to generous stock of such 
Liggett & Myers products as 
Fatima and Piedmont cigarettes, 
Granger Rough Cut and Velvet 
pipe tobaccos, and the old reliable 
Star tobacco for eating purposes.

are also offered in summer school, 
but these arc for those who arc 
already holding the higher posi
tions.
Prospects for the new course 
are very promising, six sophomores 
having selected the course this 
year. This is the largest number 
to elect the course since 1917. En
rollment in the evening classes is 
also very promising, 20 students 
having enrolled in the course in 
Curriculum Building in Vocational 
and Industrial Arts. A great num
ber of these arc teachers now 
teaching in public schools in the 
Pittsburgh area.
Several plans arc also under way 
to bring this course to the atten
tion of the public school teachers 
of Pennsylvania, and prospective 
students in this part of the coun
try. This new publicity campaign, 
together with the fact that higher 
salaries arc now being paid to 
teachers and instructors in manual 
arts, should serve to make the re
organization work complete and 
establish the course on a firm 
basis.
Tau Beta Pi, national engineer

Pi, Sunday, October 14, at the 
Sigma Nu house, George M. Wile 
was elected delegate to the Twentyseventh Convention of Tau Beta 
Pi, to be held at St. Louis, Novem

KILTIE BAND APPEALS TO 
ALUMNI FOR UNIFORMS
Each year there arc a great num
ber of men who report regularly 
for Kiltie Band practices. Each 
man who works faithfully is en
titled to wear the Kiltie uniform 
when the band appears in public. 
However, this year only 58 of these 
men arc able..to appear in the 
Kilts because of the lack of these 
uniforms. Taking into considera
tion the care, losses and depre
ciation of the uniforms, the Band 
needs 22 new uniforms in order 
that it be sufficiently supplied, 
Other colleges whose bands are 
composed of 80 to 100 men arc 
able to buy enough uniforms so 
that every member who is eligible 
may wear one.
The condition of Carnegie's Kil
tie Band presents a problem which 
is going to be difficult to' solve.
In former times the Alumni have 
helped the undergraduates in simi
lar affairs. A plan has been sug
gested that each clan furnish one 
uniform for the band. In this way 
the required number of uniforms 
would be obtained. It is. hoped 
that something definite will be 
agreed upon in the near future so 
that the entire band may appear 
in uniform before the Football 
Season is over.
Jess Swectser's tec shots arc said 
by experts to be the smoothest of 
any golfer.

STUDENTS OPINION OF | 
THE ENGINEERS IDEALS 
An engineer is a practical man. 
He is interested in making material | 
things, dams or mines or electrical t 
machines or telephone and tele
graph systems. If he has any 
ideal, lie certainly has the one of 
doing things efficiently. The word, 
engineer, in fact, conveys this to 
most people; when charges of ma
terialism arc being made, the en
gineer comes in for the major part 
because he follows this ideal too 
well. What I am going to say 
will be a little different from, the 
charges of ^ materialism. From my 
point of view the engineer is not 
too much of a materialist, but too 
little. He doesn't let his opinions 
know what his actions arc. Even 
though there is something quite 
admirable about his efficiency, he 
wont claim it because lie is more 
interested in claiming what I feel 
are illusions, ideals that have no 
actual significance at all. He 
claims publicly to be what no one 
is, and about what lie actually, is 
lie says no word.
The ideal of doing things cffir 
cicntly can be followed regardless 
of the value of the work being 
done. The man who takes to en
gineering -natively, writes memo
randa, uses office equipment, and 
works on the car or the radio, 
wit:, as much efficiency as he uses 
professionally. Ive seen engineers 
patch an unsatisfactory memoran
dum into a satisfactory one by the 
use of paste and shears, saving 
themselves the trouble of rewriting 
the parts which were good. It 
sterns to be a gift; there is a type 
engineer as certainly as there is a 
type artist or newspaper man, or 
poet, or financier. Working effi
ciently satisfies an engineer, and 
he is dissatisfied with the tempera
ment and work of an artist, for in
stance, who. doesnt go about it 
efficiently. Plenty of the wives of 
engineers know how much of a 
curse in the kitchen is the ideal 
of efficiency. The native engineer 
who works this way doesnt acquire 
his efficiency, and so is probably 
not justified in saying it is his 
ideal, since lie can do nothing dif
ferent in any event. But efficiency 
can be said to be the ideal which 
the engineer represents, and, as I 
think,, the only ideal which has been 
claimcd for him or by. him, which 
he satisfies.
The engineer rarely claims this 
as his ideal; he is not content to 
belcvc that lie is simply a highclass machine. When you place 
such a simple function before him 
as an ideal, he backs away. In the 
engineering, magazines, upon every 
public occasion whenever engineers 
arc spoken about, and prominently 
displayed in . the Engineering So
cieties Building the statement ap
pears that the engineering ideal is 
the control of nature' for the serv
ice of mankind. This is a gener
ality that can offend nobody, nor 
make any change in the working 
habits or judgments of the engi
neers. I doubt if it has any mean
ing for the engineer; Ive never 
heard any discussion of it, and I've 
ncVcr seen ail engineer pause in 
making a decision' to consider the 
welfare of mankind. But upon 
every public occasion when it's 
necessary to say something which 
will offend nobody, and sound well, 
the engineers repeat this. What 
engineer anyway would be rash 
enough to say what was to the 
scrvicc of mankind? Engineers 
through their activities provide a 
more complicated system of satis
fying economic wants, and in addi
tion to that, a few toys to keep 
themselves amused, such as tele
vision and the radio. At the same 
time they succeed in keeping amuse
ment before the public, and in di
verting their interest from what 
they want, to how theyre getting 
it. This isnt doing a scrvicc; its 
a game of open your eyes and shut 
your mouth. There's more interest 
in seeing how the things coming 
to you, than in eating it. Theres 
no particular scrvicc to mankind, 
or the race, or even the individual 
who, I suppose, would do the thing 
for himself without much more 
trouble, but' there is a big service 
to business. Business is booming, 
and it requires engineers to make 
the steel, the radios, the cars, the 
railroads; the people to whom the 
engineers arc of real scrvicc are 
the people whom they directly 
serve, the financiers. /
My point is not that the en
gineers are wilfully doing harm to 
mankind, but that they arc deluded 
in claiming to do it a scrvicc sim
ply because they happen to be ma
nipulating materials. An engineer 
in doing his job doesnt consider 
mankind explicitly at all, and t,he 
consideration is irrelevant to his 
doing the job well, presumably the 
necessary thing.
This will be calumny to the 
teachers in the colleges. I have 
heard a college professor say that 
an engineer should be a valued 
member of society because of his 
training in cold straightforward 
thinking, and his ability to get at 
the facts. On this account he 
should try to be more in the social 
system; be a leading citizen of his 
community, broaden his interests 
and his viewpoints, so as to be a 
leading factor in everything that 
goes on. The idea behind this, is 
that everything he touched would 
turn _ to gold. Given the direct 
thinking which is the result of his 
training, the bungling inadequate 
social system would bccome an ef
ficient machine.
My own experience in engineerAIR POCKETS
Professor J. Vick O'Brien, of 
the Music Department, received, on 
Thursday, October 18, a post card 
from friends in Berlin which came 
via Graf Zeppelin.- The picture on 
the post card is that of the huge 
Zeppelin itself just outside its 
hangar. The stamp is decorated 
with a picture of the Count fly
ing over the world.*****
Howard Wilkoff, who left last 
Thursday, Octobcr 18, for the con
ference at Yale, returned yesterday 
with complt reports and data 
on everything that happened which 
can be used to promote activities 
and interest in aeronautics at Car
negie. At the next meeting of the 
Aviation Club on Monday, Octobcr 
29, Wilkoff will acqucnt the mem
bers with all the information lie 
has received at the conference. *****
The constitution and by-laws of 
the-Flying Club have been drawn 
up in full and have been sent to 
a committee from Student Council 
for . final approval. The national 
aviation laws and statutes which 
have been included in. the consti
tution will serve to make the club 
a flying organization in the strictest 
aeronautical sense of the term. *****
The proposed routine of the 
Flying Club has been explained to 
the. students in the new course in 
Elements of Aeronautical Engineer
ing. It is to the advantage of 
both the Flying Club and the stu
dents in the Aeronautical course 
that they work together with a 
mutual exchange of ideas and in
terests. '
ing has helped to convince me not 
only that the ideals of which I 
have talked, were illusions, but 
that all the ideas and ideals I had 
got on my own hook in college 
were shady. My ideals were very 
vague, and reduced to words they 
lose a good deal of their signifi
cance. Mai:;ly, 1 believed in the 
significance of my occupation, per
haps mostly because it was mine, 
arid very little out of its own right.
This is not an isolated occurrcncc 
in my experience. I have been in 
conference with consulting engi
neers, who were very well known 
in the profession, and at the time 
when they were at a loss as to the 
facts of the discussion they talked 
ideals in a broad general way. They 
talked in a broad general way only 
when they were incompetent; when 
they started to work, they got 
down to details. I have never 
heard anyone talk in a broad gen
eral way when using his wits for 
some purpose.
. Since society is generally content 
with the specialized organization it 
has, here isnt a good reason why 
the engineer should claim to know 
values or to make them. It is as
sumed < that there is a reason for 
his activity, and that lie is obliged 
merely to sec things done efficient
ly. The philosophers are to say 
what acts arc valuable. If this 
way of working isnt satisfactory, 
then something should^ be done to 
change, it. But nothing will be 
changcd by making slogans for 
business reasons. The. way that I 
se^ for putting real values into en
gineering is to make all the philos
ophers into engineers, and the en
gineers philosophers, so' that the 
philosophers would be obliged to 
put theory into practicc, and the 
engineers would be obliged to con
sider questions that arc never asked 
in doing their job.

The Margaret Morrison Cos
tume Economics Club is to hold a 
Christmas Fair this year a few 
weeks before Christmas vacation. 
Selling will be done in the faculty 
rooms on the first floor of the 
Margaret Morrison building.
According to the committee, 
composed of the officers of the 
club and the faculty of the Cos
tume Economics department, this 
is to be the biggest event of its 
kind in the Margaret Morrison his
tory. All classes in the department 
will contribute to the sale. Many 
of the articles will be produced as 
class projects under supervision 
of the faculty.
A large assortment of woodblocked Christmas wrapping pa
pers is to be shown. Seniors in 
the department will make the de
signs and freshmen in the Elemen
tary Design Courses, under the 
supervision of Miss Alexander, will 
cut the blocks and do the actual 
printing of the papers. Sophomore 
dress-making classes, under the su
pervision of Miss Richards and 
Mrs. Van Steenburg Haydock, will 
contribute their share in the under
taking in the form of smocks and 
coolie coats. According to the 
committees first plans, the Combi
nation division will construct 
smocks unusual in design and 
practical in cut; the Sophomore 
Costume Economics girls will cre
ate exotic coolie coats. Batik scarfs 
in squares, rectangles, trangles are 
to be designed and made by Jun
ior., and Seniors in the coursc.
The time of the sale is being' 
planned to give everyone on the 
campus ample opportunity to do 
their Christmas shopping before 
the usual rush begins. It is pre
dicted that such an assortment as 
will be found at the Christmas 
Fair will prove a solution to many 
a gift buying problem.

The out-of-doors is Professor

vigorous. None in these respects 
differs from much of his other 
work. It, too, is an out-door pic

noticeable here more than in his. 
other pictures. However it differs 
from his former work, Professor 
Warner believes it as artistic a

recorded for each student flyer. All 
flying activities will center from 
Bettis Field, and only licensed air 
ports will be used as terminals. 
Withdrawal from the Club is made 
possible simply by selling back to 
the club ones stock certificate.
Every conceivable precaution will 
be observed to insure absolute safety 
for every member who actually 
participates in flights. Permission 
to use the plane must be obtained 
from the office of the Flying Club 
before each flight. Complete and 
minute data will be kept of every 
flight and the condition of every 
part of the plane at all times. Avia
tion statutes concerning such par
ticulars as minimum height over 
cities, the .use of non-liccnsed air 
ports, landings and plane inspec
tions shall be rigidly adhered to. 
The Club will carry complete prop
erty and public insurance for the 
protection of both its plane and its 
members.
Now _ that actual flying and the 
possession of a plane is assured as 
a reality at Carnegie, Wilkoff, at 
the Yale Aeronautical Conference, 
will, includc in his program a dis
cussion with the presidents of the 
Flying Clubs in other schools the 
possibilities of Carnegie in the 
Intercollcgiatc Air Races.
The temporary office of the Fly

Laurel and Elm Halls, two 
Forbes street girls  dormitories, 
will celebrate Halloween this year, 
as usual, with a dance which is to 
be held at Laurel Hall, Friday 
evening, November 2. Ralph 
Ivruck and his Tartans, who are 
quite well-known to Carnegie stu
dents, will furnish the music. An 
informal program will be offered.
Pumpkins, cornstalks, witches, 
goblins, and other Halloween dec
orations will lend a festive spirit 
to the . occasion, which promises 
to be a very enjoyable and enter
taining one. Miss Green, Mrs. 
Patterson, House chaperone of 
Laurel Hall, and Mrs. Stewart, 
House chaperone of Elm Hall, will 
be the chaperones. This dance is 
to be held exclusively for the girls 
of the Laurel and Elm dormitories. 
It_ is somewhat of a traditional af
fair with these two Halls and, hay
ing always been a great success in 
former years, it is expected, this 
year, to equal or even cxcced all 
previous standards.
Musical Clubs Annual
Dance Held Friday, Oct. 19
The annual fall dancc of the 
Musical Club was successfully held 
last Friday evening, .October 19, in 
the Carnegie Union. The music 
was furnished by the well-known 
dancc orchestra, the Plaid NightHawks, under the direction of Roy 
F. Dietz.
The Musical Clubs Dance is one 
of the outstanding features of the 
schools social calendar. This year, 
it assumed greater importance,^ be
cause it represented the combined 
efforts of both glee clubs.
Paul Brautigam will assist in the 
directing, taking charge of the club 
at all public appearances. Al
though not a senior, Mr. Brau
tigam was appointed to his posi
tion on the strength of his interest 
in the work of the club for the 
two past yeans. He was soloist 
on every program presented last 
year. He is a member of the 
Delta Upsilon Fraternity, and a 
pledge of the Phi Mu Slplyi Sinfonia, the musical honorary.

PITT BACKFIELD STARSPLAID STARDistillation Is Used In Purifying of Manganese !TheW.&J.Gameas it Ap
peared to a Plaid ParticipantDue to the prominence of the 
Eighteenth Amendment in the eyes | 
of the public, distillation means 
making alcoholic beverages. But 
distillation in Pittsburgh is not 
(confined) to alcohol. Doctors 
Walters, Krivobok, and Friauf, ; 
Scientists of the Bureau of Metal
lurgical Research at the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, arc using 
this method to purify manganese, 
a metal which melts at a higher 
temperature than copper. They arc 
doing it by radio.
Manganese is present in all steels. 
But as common as manganese is, 
it has never been prepared in a 
pure form in any great quantity. | 
While many metals are purified by 
electrolysis, it is practically impos
sible, scientists say, to treat man
ganese this way. The thermit pro
cess and others of the same kind 
do not yield manganese pure, enough 
for the work which is being carried 
on at the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology.
Metals with low melting points 
like mercury, zinc and cadmium 
ire purified by distillation. Work
ing along that line, Carnegie scien
tists surmised that manganese 
:ould be purified in the same way. 
But there were several difficulties 
-.o be overcome. In the first place 
something had to be found to hold 
manganese when it is hot, some j 
method of heating was necessary 
which would not introduce impu
rities, and finally, the manganese  
had to be protected from oxidation. 
The clouds of reddish smoke com
ing from the steel mills are manga
nesemanganesq which is lost by 
combining with the air during steel ! 
making.
These difficulties have been over
come by Dr. F. M. Walters, Jr., j 
director, and Drs. V. N. Krivobok  
and J. B. Friauf, associates, in the ! 
laboratories'of the Bureau by carryj 
ing out the distillation in a vacuum 
using special crucibles made of ex
tremely pure magnesia. The heatI 
ing is done by high frequency inj 
duction. The crude metallic man-: 
gancsc is placed in a crucible, and j 
covered by another, , placed upside 
down to collect the distilled metal. 
These crucibles arc placed inside'a 
fused quartz tube four inchesin 
diameter and two feet long which 
Is closed at both ends. The air 
is pumped out of the quartz tube 
until there is less than one twentyihousandth'of it left. Around the 
quartz tube is a water cooled cop
per coil of about thirty turns.
Through this coil is passed an al
ternating currcnt of about two am
peres at 7700 volts. Its frequency
Is 20 kilocycles, but since no broad
casting is done, the Federal Radio 
Commission has not been consulted. 
'The energy from the high frequen
cy currcnt passes through the
quartz tube, through the vacuum, 
ill rough the crucible walls and sets 
up eddy currents which heat the 
manganese up to its melting point. 
On the outside of. the tube the 
copper coil is almost as cold as 
lie water in the city mains, but 
inside the tube, only two inches 
away, the manganese is so .hot that 
L hurts the eyes to look at it.
Pure manganese has a bright, sil
very lustre which docs not tarnish 
when exposed to air. Unlike many, 
metals .which arc comparatively 
soft and ductile when pure, dis
tilled manganese is brittle, and hard 
enough to scratch glass.
The Carnegie Tech metallurgists 
plan to use this pure manganese 
in the preparation of alloys of 
iron, manganese and carbon, as 
free from impurities as possible, in 
order to discover just what prop
erties such pure alloys have. This 
is a part of the work of the Bureau 
of Metallurgical Research which 
was reported at the open meeting 
held by the Metallurgical Advisory 
Board on October 19.

thinking, of wity Harpstcr. gave 
Carnegieit% lastscore, he crossing 
tlie.line on'a plunge when every
one was expecting one of Karcis 
bone crushing smashes.
The entire team was in excellent 
form. Harpstcr, of course, was the 
most dominating man on either 
team. lie ran the Carnegie team 
as if it. were a machine, pulling a 
lever here and pushing a . button 
[there and making-it do just what 
he wished. In other words, his 
generalship was perfect. His passes 
more than frequently found their 
mark and when lie carried the ball 
lie was not stopped until at least 
three or four men were left behind 
biting the dust. Letzcltcr played 
a great game, running through the 
line and snaring Harpstfcrs passes 
in a manner that means nothing 
but general ability.' Eytli establish
ed himself as the fastest man on 
the squad, his legs working up and 
down like trip hammers whenever 
he carried the ball, which was oft
en. Much of Carnegies yardage 
may be attributed to him. Moorehcad, another speedy back, dis
played, great form in his specialty, 
wide' Sweeping 'end -runs.' Many a 
time he made the spectators sit up, 
or rather st;and up, and take no
tice. Highbergcr and Drcshar 
played a heads up game,, on the 
line and made' it no easy matter 
for the W. & J. backs to advance 
the ball through them. Miclziner 
and Ted Roscnzweig played a 
game of 'the same calibre, with tlie 
latter crowning his efforts by scor
ing Carnegies second tpuchdown. 
Strange as it may seem, all the 
stars were not Tartans. Aschman 
and Douds stood out as the two 
best men on the visitors team. 
Both fought like tigers for. their 
cause and neither one quit until 
lie had to be carried from the field. 
They arc men of which W. & J. 
may be justly proud. The Presi
dents line was weakened notice
ably by their obscncc, for the subs 
were unable to bear the brunt of 
Carnegies smashing attack. Prob
ably there was too much Karcis 
for their comfort.
The game was more than pleas
ing to-every supporter of the Plaid. 
W. & J. was beaten decisively and 
that is what they wanted. Now, 
all thoughts arc turned toward Pitt. 
This Saturdays game will be a 
real contest, a continuation of an 
old feud. Pitt is preparing; Car
negie is preparingso watch out. 
The winner will be crowned king 
of Pittsburgh. Nitt now holds the 
honor, ,but if tlie will of every Tar
tan sympathizer is done, all those 
who travel to Schcnlcy Park for 
the pursuit of their studies will be 
yelling at the top of their voices, 
The King is dead. Long live therug. ?

Early last week the first meeting of 
the Carnegie Student Branch of the 
A.I.E.E. was held in Room 11, 
Machinery Hall. Forty Elcctrical 
Engineering Students were present 
for this first meeting.
Professor Work, the head of the 
Elcctrical -Engineering Department, 
gave a talk in which lie made a 
plea for more active student sup
port of-the branch of the A.I.E.E. 
and urged the students present 
papers on technical subjects at the 
meetings throughout the year.
Professor. Dennison also of the 
Elcctrical Engineering Department, 
gave a brief history of the A.I.E.E. 
and the purpose of the organiza
tion. He then  explained the sev
eral prizes which arc offered by 
the National Organization of the 
A.I.E.E. for the best student papers 
presented at the meetings.
The general policy for the year 
was outlined by ..G. M. Cooper, 
chairman. The motto for the year 
is, "Developing the Individual -E|ir 
ginccr. The' program includes for 
the coming :meetings talks by the 
studentsfor the purpose of making 
cacli student, at least able to pres

Carnegies country-crosscrs have 
been picking them up and putting 
them down industriously of late, in 
an effort to get,their legs in good 
shape for the trot with Pitts val
ley - vanquishers' next Saturday 
morning. Coach'Guy Halfcrty has 
been working; the squad hard dur
ing the past week in order to put 
them in the prov.crbial pink, which 
color will be very necessary next 
Saturday. According to all reports, 
Pitt's, cliff-climbcrs arc going to 
.be the hardest squad to beat this 
.season.
The progress made by the Plaid 
men since the Thiel meet, which 
Carnegie won 19-42, has been sur
prisingly rapid. In the time trials 
last Friday "the first six men. to. 
finish were Salkin, Worley, Captain 
Campbell, Anderson, McCombs and 
Gedcon, in that order. Each man 
cut down his time for the six-mile 
course at least half a minute. Salkin was clocked a full minute 
faster than hjs winning time in the 
Thiel meet. Captain Campbell made 
the most notable advancement dur
ing the week. He finished si&th 
among the Carnegie men in the 
Thiel, meet, but tripped in on the 
heels of Worley last Friday, in 
third place.
The spirit of the squad seems 
fine. Not only arc they all work
ing conscientiously every week day, 
but some of them, including Cap
tain Campbell, do road work on 
Sundays. Still there is not much 
danger of them going' stale, as 
Coach Halferty will slow them 
down a little bit this week to taper 
off to a fine point -for Pitt.
The Plaid path-pounders who 
will start against the Panthers Sat

ON THE PLAID SCREEN 
BOY, OH BOY 1 WHAT A BATTLE!! And Andy Kerrs 
joys sure did put up a scrap that brought praise from even the 
staunchest of pro-Carnegians. We dont like to belittle, but 
Duquesnc would never have beaten Saturdays W. and J. eleven.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, this season, Harpster was forced 
td take his hands from his hips and show his All-American 
possibilities. His snaring a forward and sprinting down the side 
lines, as per his usual custom, was one of the many hi-lights of 
the contest. In addition we have yet to see Harpy miss a tackle 
ind as for field generalship, his is above criticism.
WE ADMIT THAT, in the first quarter, we were somewhat 
worried; it looked as if the old Indian Sign was still on the 
job. The offensive was spasmodic and the defensive was being 
:orn through. Getting their second wind and settling down to 
uisiness the Skibos-put on a brilliant football exhibit, although 
/t were of the opinion that they were still not up to top form.

were carried from the field, victims of Stone Crusher .Karcis 
and several, others. Aschman especially, put up a clean and 
praiseworthy game and should have left the battle a quarter

Moscow, Idaho, Oct.The Uni
versity of Idaho boasts an allAmerican coaching "Staff.
Three coaches arc Head Coach 
Charley F. Erb. Jr., who was on 
Walter Camps:team of 1923; Line 
Coach Stewart N. Beam, who won 
a place on Camps team in '1924, 
and Ralph F. Hutchinson, new as
sistant coitch? second all-Aiiicrican 
quarterback in 1899.
FOR THE SKIBOS, Harpster has already received due 
mention; Karcis is rapidly making a name for himself with his 
vicious onslaughts which invariably leave a trail of injured in 
:heir wake. MOOREHEAD and EYTH, spelling each other 
)ff, together with LETZELTER, were brilliant; one cant very 
well mention individuals, they arc all good.
Gains through IilGHBERGERS side had to be measured 
h feet, and there probably would not have been a victory, with
out DRESHAR, MELZEINER and ROSENZWEIG on the 
ne; Rosenzweigs spectacular catch put him on the scoring list. 
'ONY SWEET, without his white socks, gave his usual speedy, 
ependable performance.
SCHNUPP will be O. K. for the Pitt tussle and MEL 
jems alright. Nobodys injured and everything looks rosy for 
aturday.
AGAIN WE SLAM school spirit; it seems like the average 
student puts a grid game in the saniie category as a motion pic
ture; if it ends well, O. K., if not, its just so much time wasted.
RETURNING ALUMNI are dumbounded at the whispers 
and sour notes emerging from the so-called cheering section. In 
the good old days, students cheered above a whisper, sang the 
Alma Mater like they werent ashamed of it, and if a coveted 
victory was won, gave some indication of their joy.
TO BE FRANK, the W. and J. pep meeting was a frost; 
students attracted by the. band looked on with an abstract air, 
letting the other fellow show the pep. Thats k great inspira
tion for a teamyes, like the devil. t
Lets get rid of some of the Carnegie egotism and look at 
the Pitt-Tech games squarely. The Panther cheering secijon, 
although never larger, is always better. Their excellent paper 
acts always make our half-hearted attempts really pitiful. If 
the cheer leaders work to put something across, at least try to 
give them more support than a silly grin. If you can cheer for 
A1 Menetti, do so all the time, it may encourage another Al.  
And when it comes to school courtesy we would say that 
the Panthers have the decided edge. Yearly their band forms a 
C, their cheering section another C to the tune of a Car
negie song. It wouldnt be a bad idea to repay them in a simi
lar manner.

THE JINX is a has been; now for Pitt. It will be a battle 
oyal before a' packed stadium. J. L. Soloman, Pitt Weekly 
Sports Editor, in an exchange of editprials, prophecies tliusly 
in the game:
Saturday afternoon Pitt welcomes the second best football 
;cam in the country when. Coach Sutherlands boys battle Dear 
)ld Carnegie. She aint what she used to be; for it is.an estabished fact that you Tartans have the best team, since the day, 
lie. Scotch campus first saw a football.'
Spurred on by, an unexpected trimming at the hands of 
Zest Virginia,, the Panthers will fight to the last whitewashedne. In fadt, we, hope they do that little fighting trick several 
tnes before the day's play is over.
Carnegie has the team this year: Pitt has thefight. For 
,e first time since 1906, when Panther-Tar.tan relation^ on the 
id field started, the unsung Panthers enter the. fray as the un;rdog\ But many an underdog has been known to come to 
:e after a little' taste of Scotch. We couldnt get. a piece of, 
[ountaineer meat this season so a little bit. of Scotch is the 
cond best, appetizer. Sutherlands men. need an appetizer for 
ic main dish of Nebraska beef is in the offing.
May . the better team win ( we have it). and if--you want to 
low the inside dope just ask Wally (Derby) Steffen. If his 
'ediction is right, please/Dear Neighbors,', dont tear down our 
athedral. It has taken us so long to get it started upward.
CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS YEARS the tennis tournamcnt 'sefems to be stepping right aloiig. Right now it looks like

Season Opens Today 
At the K. of C. Hall
On the afternoon of July 24tli, Graham McNamee, in the 
presence of responsible witnesss, made the blindfold test before 
the microphone. A camera and a stenographer recorded the result.
The 1929 Bowling Season for 
Margaret Morrison and Arts School 
girls, opens today, October 23. 
Tha Knights of Columbus bowling 
alley has bech secured by the W. 
A. A.- for the next six weeks. This 
period is expected to exhibit much 
competition hctween the different 
class members, in anticipation of 
the final tournament, which will be 
held between the various classes.
Every .Tuesday and Wednesday 
the bowling alley will b<r open for 
the use ofCarnegie girls from 2:30 
to 6:30. As can rcadily.be seen, 
this gives only ten practice days 
as the final week is reserved for 
the playing .off of class games. 
Everydhe is urged to come out and 
try to -makc;.t|tcir class team. For
mer bowling ability is not re
quired; if you can't bowl now, 
conic out and practice, Points for 
W. A. A. may be obtained by mak
ing a team or attending a majority 
of the. practices.
The tournament which always 
closes the season, was won last 
year by the Sophomores, and sec
ond place taken by the Freshman.
This years Juniors, the former 
champions, promise an excellent 
team for the season of 192S.
The Plebes cross-country men 
have been working faithfully un

two trips this season. Their' sched
ule follows:

The meet with Pitt will precede 
the Varsity-Pitt cross-country meet 
cn the same day.
In the time trials, October 12, 
the Plebes clicked off the three-- 
mile course in the vicinity of 17 
minutes. Reichard led the field and. 
Mccnan was second. Coach Hal
fcrty has a few more uniforms on 
the hooks for new candidates: for 
cross-country numerals. To obtain 
clatss numerals in cross-counlry 
work, it is merely necessary to 
take part in competition with other 
schools. Time records arc not ex
tremely important. There still re
mains time for new men to get 
in condition and, if their develop
ment is reasonable, to take part in 
the first meet, with Pitt. As the 
schedule is tentative so far, another 
meet may be scheduled for the 
open date.
The Plaid cross-country squad 
meets its first opposition next Sat
urday morning, when they attempt 
to show Pitts plebes the intricacies

YE EDITOR in retaliation predicted a 30-6 victory for 
te Skibos. Previous records mean little, however; the intense 
valry makes the under-dog, whether it is Carnegie or Pitt, 
dangerous foe. It will be the fifteenth city title battle, with 
Wallys elusive spinner and end arounds pitted against 
utherlands double and triple reverses. Odds in betting just 
int, whereas even money is plentiful. It will be a colorful 
attle, a spectacle of a life time.
THE FIRST CARNEGIE trainer ever to get injured on 
lie licld was Bull Cooper, ex-Carnegie star. Going on. the 
icld to help off the injured Kozicki, Bull threw his own temcrmcntal shoulder out of place. It was reset on the bench to 
ic tune of much tugging, sweating and swearing.
Bill Manby and Newt Cowan were also on the bench lookig over the boys and recalling past battles in which they Were

AGAINCAMPUS WEEK
The Executive Committee has 
again decided that Carnegie shall 
have no Campus Week. One won
ders if this has become a mere 
matter of yearly routine; or if they 
arc really , in earnest? It Is . diffi
cult to believe that they,would de
prive' Carnegie of what is probably 
its most; unique and distinctive so
cial function.
This action is always accom* 
panied by the reason that Campus 
Week upsets the even tenor of 
classes, throwing the scholastic 
machinery out of-gear. Admitting 
this to be true, one wonders why 
the Executive Committee does not 
request tlib President of the United 
States not to issue. the proclama
tion which designates the last 
Thursday of November as a na
tional holiday. If the calendar can 
He believed, there is a threc^day 
vacation then; which, . of  course, 
has the same disturbing effect ,,on 
the scholastic scheme of things as 
they claim for Campus Week. To 
be' consistent, the Executive Com; 
inittee would also move to abolish 
Christmas, . Easter and . Armistice 
Day. Absurd, of course, but iTo 
more absurd than the abolition of 
Campus Week.
. Carnegie is noted for the diffi
culty of its courses and the great 
amount of.-work required, from its 
students. It is a long, hard grind 
from September to June, with few 
enough breathing spells, yet those 
few are made fewer.
Carnegie does not have many 
distinctive Carnegie functions. Oth
er schools have Junior Proms, 
Commencement Dances and the 
like; no school but Carnegie  has 
a Campus Week. But to be dif
ferent, to the minds of many, is 
to be dangerous, so Tech may not 
have Campus Week.
There has been in the past only 
one function in which every Car
negie man and woman could take 
part. All lines of distinction were 
forgotten; there were no Plebes, 
no Sophs, no Juniors, no Seniors, 
no Barbs, no Greeks, nor was 
there even any distinction between 
day students and night students 
just, Carnegians. In this function 
only has the true Carnegie spirit 
had its fullest expression, and now 
they have taken it away.
. It. is indeed sad when a group 
of men can so completely forget 
their .own under-graduate days, re
membering only that the world is 
a place of tears, where pleasure 
lias no place, and in their forget
ting and remembering, push other 
people's noses closer to the grind
stone, trying to transform men and 
women into machines.
They must see the error of that 
decision; it is inconceivable that 
they would insist upon depriving 
Carnegie of its most glorious 
tradition  Campus Week will he 
returned to us.

TIME
One of the most important fac
tors in the life of the average Car
negie. undergraduate  is time, and 
nowhere more than , on our own 
campus is less consideration given 
to accurate time recording. To the 
commuter in particular, this, appar
ent negligence is of importance, 
for seldom does the campus time,
dreams or nightmares; if it con 
.cerns us that our penal laws and 
moral codes are survivals of bar
barism and fear; if it concerns us 
that our most cherished and venhoon under the corrective forces, 
which were quite as blindly stupid 
and cruel.

or any other time-keeping agency. 
And seldom too, is the time in all 
of bur own buildings the same. 
Some readjustment should be made, 
for at present there is frequently 
good, cause for being late to 
classes. Some days the bells are 
out of'commission entirely. There 
seems to be a decided need for 
some dependable, centralized timerecording system on the campus, 
where 8:30 classes should all be 
called at the same time and lunch
eon hours ..coincide in all four 
schools.
Perhaps it is a project for some 
enterprising graduating class to 
work outthe problem, of estab
lishing a central clock with a set 
of bells, chimes, or a mellow gong 
audible ovlr the entire campus. 
Some energetic engineer might 
cycn. devise a steam .-whistle on the 
Tower, unromantic and lacking' in 
a sense-of theaesthetic though -it 
might be! But it is nevertheless 
quite true that Carnegie does lack 
a proper co-ordination, of its time 
system, and any . improvement 
would be welcome to. the offcampus students who have learned 
to follow street, car and train 
schedules only, to discover that 
seven minutes difference exists be
tween the _Carnegie campus and the 
rest of Pittsburgh, often with the 
result that a lead is. lost in a me
chanic quiz or that, the class has 
already left on an inspection trip.
INJUDICIOUS ATTACK
During the past ten vears there 
have been many attempts to re
form educational _ practice in the 
colleges. Some of them have been 
good, some bad; some the__.nos
trums of educational quacks, oth
ers the. honest fruit of sincere dis
content with prevailing methods. 
There is a great need to winnow 
out thegood from the bad, and in 
the process a great deal of defla
tion will have to take place. In 
the meantime it is a great disser
vice to education to lump these 
experiments together and label 
them all as trash. Vet this is 
what Professor William Bennett 
Munro_ of Iiarvard does in an. ar
ticle in the September Harpers 
entitled Quack-Doctoring tlib 
College.
One suspects that Dr. Munro sat 
down to do vengeance on the 
whole school of educational reform 
after having been victimized by 
one of those educational question
naires that propose to cure every
thing by questions. That is the 
only explanation for such an out
burst. YVe hasten through a flip
pant and undiscriminating examina
tion .of Educational reforms of 
varying worth to discover Dr. 
M-unros own point of view oneducation at the end of the article. 
There lie writes: It is men, not 
methods or measures that deter
mine -whether a collegeshall he 
first-rate or second-class. We 
wonder whether. Dr. Munro would 
willingly revert to the Harvard of 
pre-Eliot days in the confidence 
that sterling men would render 
nugatory those antiauated methods 
and measures of more than 60 
years ago.

COLLEGE HUMOR
Eight college comics on the West 
Coast have refused' to allow Col
lege Humor to reprint their jokes. 
Led by the "Stanford Chapparral 
and the "California Pelican, these 
magazines declared, that they had 
seen enough -humor representing 
colleges as plrftes of petting and 
hip-flasks. They_ regard "College 
Humor'* as having broken faith 
with them, and they hope to see 
the speedy, end of all such pervarication and false judgment.
The idea is a good one. Too 
much do people think of all col
lege students as they*, see . them 
represented in the humorous maga
zines -of the day. They, cherish 
the notion that all college men 
wear coon coats, smoke . pipes> 
think every date is a.flop unless 
necking s involved, . get. drunk at 
every party, drive around in either 
old wrecks or high-powered road
sters, and generally throw away 
their fathers hard' earned money. 
It is that impression they, get from 
the papers. The man on the 
street is ever ready to get the 
most sensational, news he can; al
ways. alert tosee the worst side 
of any question; neveP. willing to 
give the matter thought and see 
the other viewpoint to a question. 
If lie did, he would realize that, 
while there has to be some recrea
tion at college, the student is 4hcrc 
essentially - because he lias 'the de
sire to acquire knowledge.
People _ do not appreciate this 
serious ..side of things at college, 
and papers do their best to foster 
this misconception. Their influence 
is utterly unwholesome in this 
respect. While such conditions as 
are pictured may perhaps exist, it 
certainly does no good to wink at 
eachother and let the matter slide.
To take a purely non-partisan 
view on the subject, the Western 
comics might well realize that 
more than likely they are doing 
just What they criticize in Col
lege Humor. Judging from what 
we see in Eastern' magazines, the 
character of the humor is not ex
actly high. Maybe a low-minded 
public demands that sort of thing. 
At any rate, we feel that to get 
to the bottom of the matter, there 
should be a general change in 
attitude in all ^college humorous 
magazines. The action of the Cali
fornia schools is commendable, but 
wc hope that it will go further.

BOOK REVIEW
A number of years ago Elinor 
Wylie wrote a volume  of rather 
.interesting poetry called Nets to 
Catch the Wind. Some years later 
she wrote a novel, The Orphan 
Angel, in which she rescued Shelly 
from what  every one has always 
supposed to have been a death 
from drowning inthe bay -. of 
Spezzia, to bring him to America, 
where she let him wander about 
the States talking in an altogether 
extraordinary and unbelievable 
fashion. Now, in this very year, 
Miss Wylie has published another 
excellent, volume of poetry, Trivial 
Breath/ and another novel, Mr. 
Hodge and Mr.. Hazard.
Mr. Hodge and Mr, Hazard 
is a thoroughly delightful and 
interesting book, and besides that, 
it is beautifully written. -Mr. Hazard 
is the hero of the story. He is. 
50 years old, a sardonic and de
fiant spirit  at odds with his wife 
and son, his relatives and friends; 
a poet with a skin the color of 
a vellum dictionary of .the Fifteenth 
century because he was with 
Byron at Missolonghi where lie 
merely had malaria and miracu
lously neglected to die of it; a 
man whose genius for making 
himself uncomfortable did not stop 
short of terrestrial immensities: 
Hazard comes back to England to 
be met by his old friend Hartlcigh-, 
the -'impecunious editor of an un
successful review, and to. fall sick 
with influenza,, which companions 
his mortal loneliness from Febru
ary to May. Somehow, however, 
lie manages, to cure himself. Find
ing that the doctor affected his 
nerves to li .wire drawn extremity 
which had much in common with 
severe neun<ilgia lie had avoided 
him by brilliant guess work, and 
a series of long walks. What 
fools they are-who have called him 
gentle, one ofhis friends re
marks, he is the fiercest creature 
I ever beheld; he frightens me out 
of my wits, and without my wits 
Im nothing. And Annamaria, 
Hartleighs excellent spouse, says 
of him, "Bitter, bitter as gall. And 
I can remember him when lie was 
the most affectionate, open-hearted 
boy in the world. Hazard goes 
down . to the country and takes 
lodgings, with a mantelpiece upon 
which to range his seven Hebrew 
grammars. He already had in 
mind his "Job: A Lyrical Drama. 
That same afternoon he rowed up 
the river reading Milton and fell 
asleep, to wake up looking at two 
girls, their heads like preposterous 
and lovely flowers grafted upon 
the willow bows. He. thought them 
the prettiest children he had ever 
seen. Allegra and Penserosa hap
pen to be the charming children of 
the charming Ladv Clara Hunting. 
Ridiculous creature!" she muses, 
when 'she meets the man her daugh
ters have discovered. But I sup
pose hes had a rather hard time 
of it. He cant have found all 
those odd, dreary pepple to his 
taste. Its not to be wondered at 
that he finds us an agreeable 
change after that galley. I believe 
I shall ask him to dinner one 
day. Then, there begins for Mr. 
Hazard a summer of pastoral con
tent and poetic achievement, in the 
shadow of Claras hospitality at 
Lyonesse. Soon enough the end
arrives; back to Lyonesse; comes 
the boys and their tutor, Mr. 
Hodge. Mr. Hazard appears for 
lunch one day after being caught 
in a' shower, looking ill and ex
hausted; his felicity was. unapparent, but it was plain thalt one. 
of his shoes wanted mending, and 
there were several buttons missing 
from his coat. An appalling 
person, mutters Mr. Hodge. "He 
is eating salt with his bread, like 
a fool, and buttering his radishes
like a Frenchman, Mr. Hodge 
reflectsat table. A man who 
eats salt with his bread and but
ters his radishes is a loathesome 
phenomenon; 1 wonder that Lady 
Clara permits such a fellow at her 
table. 'And later that afternoon, 
when Rosa askshim if he has 
finished his sonnet to Milton, 
'Poor Milton, said Mr. Hodge 
in his heavy mysterious; voice, 
which was' yet plain enough fcir 
his'meaning. That obviously was 
the poets crack of doom. As a 
last gesture Mr. Hazard asks them 
all to tea in Gravclow, to' a tea 
which is really in honor of Clara 
and, the girls. But it is Mr. 
Hodge with Hilary and Tristram 
Yvlio come, bearing apologies, and 
gentle and untrue excuses from 
Clara. I haye had a letter from. 
London, Mr. Hazard tells them 
as they are about to leave. "The 
business will be long and compli
cated, itmay quite conceivably take 
me to Abyssihia. Mr.' Hodge had 
conquered Mr. Hazard,- andsoends 
thistale' of "a minor romanticpoet 
who \Vas evidently' the victim -of 
an excessive sensibility which the 
high' order of his talents failed to 
stiffen into character. Mr.-. Hazard, 
however, .will remain for a long 
time one of the best romantic 
portraits in contemporary fiction.

In All Kneeling,'" Miss Parrish 
has written a gentle satire on'the 
genus poeticus. Christabel Caine, 
author of Stars and Wild StrawIjprries, Carnation Flower, and, 
before tlie completion of the novel, 
several equally vigorous titles, 
serves as exponent of the poetic 
yearnings of the liaiit ton. En
gaged to marry a promising but 
as yet unsuccessful : :paintera 
genuine, 'artist, understand, not a 
commercial daubershe wisely de
cides that pure love alone will not 
feed the baby and so switches her 
affection to a Babbitt of the first 
water.
Follows marriage, the dawn and 
disillusionment. While the wed
ding breakfast is not quite digested, 
Christabel flirts desperately with 
one of her admirers whom she 
nicets by' accident on the steamer 
slid must b'c true to her poetic 
self, come  what may.- In Europe 
she learns, not without some satis
faction, that her former lover had 
attempted suicide. On her return 
to. America she takes up the round 
of social engagements, teas and 
poetic readings which, thanks to 
the munificence of her husband, 
she is now'able to enjoy. With 
the coming of the war, Christabel 
finds her time' quite occupied* with 
teas and poetic readings; after the 
war she goes back to teas and 
poetic readings. The - amount . of 
tea consumed in .this . short. work 
would easily float the battleship 
Oregon.
In the novel as in her life, 
Christabels husband plays a minor 
role, save that lie serves to pro
vide her with a beautiful home, 
luxuries, a butler and a set pf 
twins.' Preoccupation: with .her ma
ternal and social duties, far from 
dulling Christabcls poetic ardor, 
has the reverse affect, and her 
w.orks roll from tlie presses regu
larly^ Nor is her love-life neglect
ed, for she finds time to. indulge 
in a series of quite insipid love af
fairs. And so this unnecessary 
work wanders -on aimlessly.
Miss Parrish has graciously ex
plained the significance of the title 
with a quotation from the Book of 
Common prayer, "To be saidby 
the whole congregation . . . all 
kneeling. An inconsequential novel, 
treating of insignificant people in 
a light and . sometimes charming 
manner, fortunately not long.

over the campus are not young

ache, but Maggie Murph soplior

partments. These initiations, are 
most disconcerting. Just at the

politely but forcibly requested to 
engage in such indignities as do^

fair co-eds aim for the target only

something sensible to-them.but to

means much less than nothing. 
These young men seem, however,

hopes of-relieving our Institute of

thing attractive about this par
ticular article of apparel? If so, 
we fail to see it. Many sugges

require Plebes to wear these ador
able little bonnets instead of arm
bands? Our fascinating frosh with 
their customary respectful, adher
enceto regulations would hide 
them in the bottom drawers of 
their wardrobes, trunks, and the
member of the' upper classes would 
abandon them for the same obvi
ous reason that ouryoung men of 
sophomore rank or above despise 
the conservatively beautiful black 
necktie. Alsobe it whispered 
several (well, maybe, only one' or 
two), gentlemen are adorning them

rakishness at which they wear
them has. never before been 
achieved, except perhaps by the

Is it to fill the gap between 
adolescence and maturity? Or is-it 
because going to college is the

If purposes suh. as the fore

SERIOUSLY SPEAKING
In an adjoining column last week, 
tlie "professoriat was; subjected to 
an acid analysis. The treatment 
was unmerciful and exceedingly be
havioristic. But inasniuch as the 
usual professor is-simply a student 
who has taken his undergraduate 
days more seriously, he has.' thus 
put himself i'n a position to exam
ine the follies of his. fellow-sjtudents closelj-. We claim more com
petence in dissecting tlie. studcntbo'dy than our critic has in exainining our ilk, because lie is prob
ably only one of the more dejected 
victims of the amateur antics of the 
'prof, and hence totally! unsympa
thetic with our maladies.
On one scoije, lat least, the palm 
must be awarded to the student 
body, and that is in the matter of 
hilarious vaudevillian tac'tics.'- There 
is probably no body of persons .to^ 
day more' expert in running off 
small circus performances. We 
have evidences of. this constantly 
before us on  every campus. No 
matter. how facctious and wise
cracking the lecturer may become, 
there is little hope that lie can 
ever evoke as much hilarity, and 
pervasive jolliment as the sopho
mores produce in tormenting the 
freshmen. 
There is certainly nothing more 
unjust and unmanly than baiting 
and harassing the. novices on the 
campus, for no other reason than 
theyhave had the misfortune . of 
arriving at college as' freshmen. 
It'brings out a vicious cruelty as
sociated with:the class spirit, all of 
which appearsto us highly incon
sistent with the democratic tradi
tion of this. country. Indeed, there 
is a deep-seated delight in all of 
L8 in witnessing others in a ludi
crous and incongruous situation,, es
pecially. when we are .protected 
from the same fate  bya nominal 
allegiance to an older group. There 
is no objection to the practice if 
the poor freshman is -willing, but 
what of the one who revolts and 
shies? -Must he be subjected also 
to silly, and often sorry exhibitions 
of thepack spirit? It is not im
possible to believe, for example, 
that there are highly sensitive per
sonalities that are severely injured 
by undergoing what seems to us 
simply ah innocent prank.
Such goings-on comport more 
with the environment of a liigliscjiool or academy where the bojs 
are still in the stage  pf' develop
ment in which it is a major sport 
to rob birds nests and pick the
wings, off insects, ^ndmost

THE SIN OF -DIFFERENCE 
To be different is to lead, or 
to be shunned.There is no middle ground tor 
.those who differ greatly from the 
groups limits inany rspet, phy
sical, mental, or moral.
At Dartmouth you are a leader 
of studen.t opinion, . wh,ichmeans 
 that a  Lfe.w persons agree, with 
you, if you retain a positive' per
centage of your identity with me
diocrity arid differ only in the 
trivial and momentary whirnsies of 
the crowd.
You are. apariah if you dare 
to differ in too many things. Peo
ple invariably seem to trust and 
respect someone who is of their 
breed and'yet a little bit, not too 
much, different from - the major
ity. They shun those in whom 
the common ties are infrequent, 
if existent at all.
Accordingly the campus ideal 
is keyed to mediocrity. The best 
fraternity man is invariably the 
one on whom most people can 
agree. Perhaps this is the rea
son why so many of tlie campus 
big shots achieve only an indif
ferent success after college, while 
those who remained in compara
tive obscurity during undergrad
uate days arc reported to achieve 
dazzling success in the "world.
For those sophomores who do 
not make a fraternity the way to 
rationalization is - easy. It can be

VIRGINIA HONOR 
Thomas Jeffersons ideal of a 
perfectly working honor system as 
promulgated by him in the Uni
versity of Virginia was implanted
in the University of Texas a.s, one 
of its most cherished ideals, twenty 
years ago.
Dean Taylor, dean of the Col
lege of Engineering, says, "The 
honor, system was born with the 
University and is one of its most 
cherished ideals. It is. part of the 
university education. The honor 
system was  founded not only for 
use iii the University, but also for 
use throughput the life of the 
student.
The University is a state insti
tution, supported by the taxes of 
its peopje. "Is ,the state justified 
in. spending money on students, who 
will not obey the honor system, or, 
in other words, is. the state justi
fied in spending, money'on students 
wiiq would ..ch'cat'' on ah examina
tion? says Dean Taylor.
The pledge that has been used is 
totally wrong in .that, it' asks tlie 
student to spy on his fellow -stu
dents and " act as , a spy and a 
snooper. The Jefferson pledge was 
restricted to the individual - system 
that lie neither gave nor received 
aid on his examination. .
"So far, as I am conc.crne.d, I 
want nobody to enter 'the College 
of Engineering that will not keep 
the honor system from top to .bot
tom, says Dean Taylor. "There 
was one conviction last year for 
cheating, out of 727 engineering 
students. Personally I do not want 
to teach a class in the University 
of' Texas where a proctor .or a 
spy is prcscnt.The Daily Texan.
PLAY REVIEW
. A week ago 'last Friday after
noon a rather thin audience in the 
Little Theater, saw the curtain go 
up, a little ,late,, for the first mati
nee performance of the season. The 
bill was two.one acts, The Ladies 
Seminary'' and an Aiiierican com
edy relablcd by the department for 
its own reasons,  "A Comedy of 
Superstition. "The Ladies Semi
nary turnedout to be a rather 
^musing English comedy of Vic
torian society. T.wo sisters, spuiilers, .who" had inherited Llicir 
fat liens 'seminary, were".faced with 
the'...problem oi losing  many' of 
their pupils . if they admitted the 
daughter of a shop keeper, whose 
father was otherwise a respectable 
man. Two^parents try to inLimidatu the spinsters, but the inter
vention of a friendly lord makes 
possible the admission of the shop
keepers daughter, and makes the 
parents of tlie other pupilsonly 
too eager to keep their offspring 
ir. theschool. Thepiecewas 
played by necessity in a-:set  which 
was hardly Victorian; ' but 'it - was 
pretty well cast, and adequately 
acted. Mips Franklins portrayal of 
a very respectable lady was per
fect, and the . best acting of the 
afternoon. Miss Fi'ankiin -had the 
technique to create about licrself 
an illusion of middle age which 
seemed real; the others did not. 
The two spinsters, tried: to -fool us 
into believing, them in their late 
thirties, whereas the youngest was 
obviously in, litr .charming: twenties. 
Mr. Phalen s entrance-, made us 
think him a clergyman for a 'few. 
minutes, but lie. performed . his-pai l 
well. The other play was., a fun
nier -one-act, but not so weil done. 
For otic thing, it was badly cast; 
for another, at least a third of its 
laughs didnt get acrpss bccausc 
so many of its lines '-weren't prop
erty played up and pointed;. Both 
of these one-acts were staged by 
students.. ion certainly-..hope -the 
department will continue, its mati 
nee performances. The custorn'lias 
already established itself as a very 
agreeable one.
