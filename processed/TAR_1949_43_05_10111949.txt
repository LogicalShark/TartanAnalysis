Falk Foundation 
Awards Carnegie 
Grant Of $45,000
A grant totaling $45,000 has 
been given to Carnegie Institute 
of Technology by the Maurice and 
Laura Falk Foundation, Dr. Rob
ert E. Doherty announced Friday.
According to Dr. Doherty, the 
gift, which will be given in in
stallments of $15,000 the next 
three years, comes in the form of 
added support for Carnegies social 
relations program.
The money, ' e said, will be used 
to finance certain extraordinary 
costs arising in the work of de
veloping this program under the 
Maurice Falk Professorship, cur
rently held by the schools Pro
vost, Dr. Elliott Dunlap Smith.
The three-year grant, Dr. Do
herty pointed out, is the latest in 
a series from the Falk Foundation, 
which was the first group to give 
financial support to Carnegies 
non-technical curriculum when it 
established the Falk professorship 
of social relations in 1937.

President Robert E. Dougherty 
and president-elect J. C. Warner 
led an estimated 1,500 Carnegie 
students in a victory parade last 
Saturday.
It was a happy throng that fol
lowed the Lincoln convertible 
which carried the presidents from 
the field, up Forbes street and 
onto the cut.
Not even the blasting of the air 
horn of a 10-ton truck following 
the march up Forbes could have 
any effect on the noisy partici
pants.
Undaunted by the hot sun, the 
crowd bellowed some 90 rahs for 
everybody even remotely respon
sible for the victory. Each of the 
presidents was given fifteen rahs, 
fallowed by the same number for 
coach Eddie Baker, the whole 
damned team, the Kiltie band and 
finally the whole damned school.
President Doherty led a cheer 
for the team which met with joy
ful approval from the student body.
A fire bell clanged, horns tooted, 
voices strained, and the radiator 
boiled over in an old Chevrolet 
jalopy painted with the Carnegie

Lou Shulick, Dorm Council president; John Engle, budget chair

New Method Used 
For Nominating 
Homecoming Regent
Freshman queen candidates will 
be chosen by a new method this 
year. Instead of dividing nominees 
into dormitory girls and com
muters, the Cwens will conduct 
nominations on a departmental 
basis. In this way it is hoped that 
the nominees will more completely 
represent the entire freshman 
class.
Nine candidates will be chosen 
from a total of 180 freshman 
women. Since the departments 
average about twenty girls each, 
the distribution will be fairly 
even. One candidate will be nam
ed from the departments of drama, 
music, painting and design, gen
eral studies, and secretarial. The 
home economics department, with 
sixty-three women, will have 
three candidates. The architecture, 
general science, and social work 
departments, with a total of 
twenty students, will have one 
candidate.
Details Later
Nominations will be held on Oc
tober 24, 25, and 26. The place and 
time for the various departments 
will be announced later.
On Tuesday, November 1 at 
12:30, the candidates will be in
troduced to the school in front of 
the Fine Arts building.
The campaign is scheduled for 
November 1-8. The all school elec
tion which will take place on Nov. 
8 will be conducted by APO,

Do You Have Any Problems?

So you think you have troubles! Your scholastic average is low. 
Your bank book wont balance. You have personal problems and 
need advice. Or perhaps you want information concerning a par
ticular activity or organization. Whatever the problem, the first place 
the Tech student will usually go#
is the office of the Dean of Men. 
There the student knows he will 
find help concerning his particu
lar problem, or at least, informa
tion as to where help is available.
If you think you have troubles, 
pity the poor Deans. Every day 
for them is a day of solving such 
problems and troubles. Among 
their headaches are many routine 
matters such as scholarships, stu
dent loans, and part-time employ
ment.
Variety of Troubles
However, most problems come 
in supervising student activities 
and advising on special needs of 
students. These problems range
On the serious side, one of the 
problems Deans Dickinson and 
David face each year is the su
pervision of the organizational 
and financial setup of Spring Car
nival. Constantly checking to see 
no minor detail of organization is 
overlooked, they must also check 
budgets so Carnival will not op
erate at a loss. Last year's Car
nival was a narrow squeak financent attempt to reorganize the
government of Mens Dormitories. 
That reorganization was under
taken because the officers felt that 
Dorm Council was not very effec
tive in offering activities to dorm 
residents for their participation.
It was their observation that this 
was caused by the inefficiency of 
the basic form of the dormitory 
government.
Indifferent Reception 
The officers felt that the nature 
of the new governmental plan re
quired the support of all dormi
tory residents for its success, and 
that its recep
tion was one 
)f indifference, 
>r varying dejrees of scep
ticism. There
fore they felt 
that it was best 
to reinstate the 
former govern
ment as organ
ized under the 
Dormit o r y 
Council Con
stitution and that they had no oth
er alternative but to resign.
At its first meeting the mem
bers of Dorm Council wished the 
officers to continue in their posi
tions under the old constitution 
and asked them to reconsider their 
action. This they consented to do.
Clan Rejects Request 
Also on the agenda of Dorm 
Councils meeting \vas a request 
by the members that Claymore 
Clan take charge of all dormitory 
social functions. Claymore Clan 
did not accept the responsibility.
Principal reason given by the 
Clan for not taking charge of 
dorm social functions was that at 
the present time the Clan does not 
have enough members to do an 
adequate job.
As a final aftermath of the 
Dorm Council meeting, the officers 
refused to be reinstated.

Editorials
Gratitude
While on the prowl for an editorial subject, 
we dropped into the Dean of Mens office to get 
the latest on who was doing what. It then 
dawned on us that the dean's office was doing 
us another taken for granted service that was 
not among their normal duties.
The services of the Deans office have al
ways gone unsung while the value of their aid 
grows constantly. Many students would not be 
able to attend school without the financial aid 
offered by the school and administered through 
the Dean's office. Student organizations have 
found the dean's helpfulness invaluable to their 
activities.
We have mentioned only two examples of 
the regular services performed by Deans Dickin
son and David, and their assistants and secre
taries, Misses Stewart and Moses. The above 
and beyond the call of duty services would fill 
volumes.
To Dr. Doliertv
We offer our gratitude.
Thank you and youre welcome.
Into The Fire
Mild confusion in the mens dorms during 
the past weeks has now led to governmental 
chaos. The resignation of Dorm Council officers 
is a mystery to us. Just at the time when these 
men were heeded most, they have withdrawn 
their leadership from Council. No demand was 
made for the resignation; in fact; the Council 
asked them to reconsider their action. We be
lieve that their pessimistic view toward dorm 
support of the reorganization plan was unfound
ed. There is strong suggestion of a martyr com
plex in their decision to forsake their duties be
cause the plan they favored was not accepted 
unanimously by dorm members.
The underlying cause of the entire problem, 
however, is in misinformation. As seen by the 
difference of opinion between reader E. E. John
son in his letter to us last week and the let
ter in the adjoining column this week, a great 
deal of confusion surrounds the reorganization 
plan. The plan has either never been adequate
ly explained, or many dorm students have not 
made an effort to understand it.
Many of Mr. Johnsons and other dorm stu
dent's objections have been answered in the 
letter to the editor that we publish this week. 
If other objections are held they should be 
brought to light and answered in a like manner. 
No plan can be successful if distrust, misinfor
mation, or prejudice lodges in the minds of the 
students that must support it.
At the present time the dorms are completely 
disorganized. One of the largest portions of the 
campus population is thus unavailable for co
ordinated action. This situation has already par
tially stifled certain Homecoming plans.
There remains only one course of action. 
Dorm Council must elect new officers if the 
former officers will not return to their jobs. 
Students who are interested in their self gov
ernment system should consider what structure 
it should take and make proposals to the Coun
cil. All plans should be studied carefully and 
the best presented to the residents for their ap
proval. Above all, the plans should be care
fully explained to everyones satisfaction.

Clan Defends Position 
In Answer To Johnson
Editor, the Tartan:
A great deal of misinformation and ill-con
sidered criticism has been circulating in the 
dormitories recently about the plan for reorgan
izing Mens Dormitory Council. As the most re
cent example, we have Mr. E. E. Johnsons letterto-the-editor in the previous issue.
He has maintained that under the reorgani
zation plan, to use his own words, intradormitory interest would be increased and the dormi
tory council itself would operate much more effi
ciently, but that the plan be tossed into the ashcan. He has referred to a joker in the plan and 
unprecedented power on the part of the dormi
tory honorary. On what are his contentions 
based?
It is apparent that Mr. Johnson did not read 
the tentative plan (distributed in memorandum 
form to all dormitory residents) submitted this 
fall for consideration. As it refers in part to the 
Program Coordinatorthe Claymore Clan mem
berit provides as follows:
(a) He shall be a member of the Board of 
Directors of that dorm. (All other members, ex
cept for the proctor, are elected by the dorm resi
dents). Neither he nor the proctor have a vote.
(b) He will coordinate the social and athletic 
programs of his dormitory with other dormitories 
so that no conflicts are involved.
(c) He will have the responsibility of orient
ing freshmen in the dormitories.
(d) He will be the representative of the Bappiper in his dormitory.
Had this tentative plan been approved by a 
majority of dorm students, a constitution was to 
have been written, which was then to have been 
submitted to the dorm residents for ratification.
Let us now consider the original plan proposed 
last spring. It is this plan to which Mr. Johnson 
must be referring.
That Claymore Clan would receive unpre
cedented power in activities could not be further 
from the truth. The only function bf the Clan 
was to be in a coordinating and advisory capacity.
The Clan could not remove from office any 
of our council representatives and/or dorm of
ficers, for various reasons set forth in the plan. 
The Dormitory Executive Council and the dormi
tory residents themselves are the bodies, and the 
only bodies, which can remove dorm officers.
The Executive Council, duly elected repre
sentatives of the dormitory residents, is allowed 
to impeach (i.e. accuse of misconduct accord
ing to Webster) any dormitory officer. Actual re
moval can be effected only by proving in trial the 
failure or negligence on the part of any dormi
tory officer in carrying out his assigned obliga
tions. This is the sole basis of impeachment as 
stated in the plan and if this is bad, we should 
revert to anarchy.
But where then does Claymore Clan come into 
the picture? The plan suggested that Claymore 
Clan be allowed to recommend impeachment to

the Executive Council. They were 
in no way allowed to start im
peachment proceeding or to even 
make formal accusations. They 
were not empowered to usurp 
authority in the slightest, and 
they maintained a purely advisory 
position. Why was this section 
written in if Claymore gains noth
ing whatsoever? Because the co
ordinator is obligated to report 
the reasons and assign the re
sponsibilities for the success or 
failure of any specific project, 
and shall take the necessary 
steps to overcome problems as 
they arise. The Clan is simply 
pushing with all its strength to 
make the plan work and to work 
efficiently.
In all cases, the Clan member 
was non-voting and acting in an 
advisory, not supervisory, capac
ity. The presence of a Claymore 
member, would be advantageous 
because the Clan has accumulated
a great deal of valuable informa
tion from previous work on dorm
itory functions.
If it should happen that a Clan 
member were a voting member 
of dorm council, it would be so 
only because he was duly elected 
to that office as a dorm resident, 
and not because he was a mem
ber of Claymore Clan. Under no 
plan has Claymore Clan ever had 
a part in the government of the 
dormitories.
True, Claymore Clan elects its 
own members, and is responsible 
only to itself for its choices. How
ever, the one and only criterion 
which the Clan used to choose 
members is that they prove that 
they are willing to work, or have 
worked, on dormitory social or 
recreational activities. The Pre
amble and Constitution of the 
Clan are open for all to read.
There is a definite shortage of 
men in the dorms who are willing 
to work. If Mr. Johnsons sug
gestion that the membership of 
the Clan be chosen by the dorm
residents were to be followed, the 
Clan would be no more than a 
living popularity poll, with no 
proof that any elected man would 
be willing to work.
Claymore Clan has set a pre
cedent of good, hard work that 
no one can challenge. Claymore 
Clan is a hard working service 
organization and has no political 
aspirations. The fact that some 
of its members suggest a new plan 
is not detremental to them but 
a proof that they are interested 
in seeing a broad social and rec
reational program available to all 
dormitory men.
Mr. Johnson agrees with us that 
this is a very desirable aim. Since 
we contend that the proposed plan 
would have yielded these results 
and in no way granted unpre
cedented power to Claymore 
Clan, we cannot understand the 
position taken by Mr. Johnson.

Mr. Zuchs first problem was a 
petition from the Kilties Pipers 
for an appropriation of $69 to 
cover the cost of gas and oil for 
their proposed trip to the Frank
lin and Marshall game at Lan
caster, Pa., October 15.
Petition Reected 
Explaining that the Kiltie band 
had included $1200 in their budget 
to cover travel expenses, a 50% 
increase over last years allot
ment, Zuch convinced Council that 
additional aid was unnecessary. 
Also there would be no source for 
the $69, but to draw on other or
ganizations budgets. The petition 
was rejected almost unanimously.
The permanent decorations 
committee, which has charge of 
public address equipment, re
quested $40 for the repair of 
three loudspeakers in time for 
Homecoming. Action was post
poned after Councilman Horsch 
requested an investigation be 
made to determine the necessity 
of repair, or whether replacement 
would be cheaper.
Money, Money, Money 
Even the class reorganization 
committee wanted money. Their 
expenses for the freshmen rally 
were $2.74 over the $10 they were 
alloted. Council unanimously 
granted them the difference.
A proposed change in the elec
tion requirements of the by-laws, 
tabled at the previous meeting, 
was accepted by Council. They 
now require all petitions for an 
office to be in the Dean of Mens 
office two weeks before the date 
of the election.

Plaid Outlasts St. Francis, 28-19
Nick Simcie is Carnegies man of the hour. The truly in
comparable baekfield ace put on the greatest one man show 
Tartan fans have seen in many a year last Saturday as he 
almost single handedly defeated a hard fighting St. Francis 
team.
Selected last year as the outstanding Carnegie football play
er of the year, there is no question that he would once again 
be the unanimous choice if the ballots were cast today.
lie fired a 30 yard pass for the initial score, galloped 76 
yards in the most brilliant and exciting run of the young sea
son for the second, and drove over from three yards out in a 
last down attempt for tlie third tally. He gained all but 31 
of the yards the Plaid was able to make over the ground 
against the opposition and compiled the phenomenal average 
of 9.8 yards per try.
But all is not happy in the Carnegie grid picture these 
days, for the Tartans, even in winning, displayed some glar
ing weaknesses that promise to cause trouble before the sea
son becomes too much older.
It is indeed fortunate that the sore spots appeared when 
they did. A later outbreak might well be disastrous.
Weak pass defense became more obvious than ever before 
when the Plaid found themselves unable to cope with the 
powerful arm of Danny Marchitello. To be sure, it was Marchitellos uncanny accuracy that was the biggest factor in St, 
Francis long gains through the air, but the Carnegie defense
against him was poor.Onlv one interception, and that on a play which Jack 
Magnifico seemed to have diagnosed even before it started, 
resulted all afternoon. It is significant that the only Bethany 
score and the first St. Francis touchdown came by way of 
passes, while a second was set up by a 25 yard aerial.
St. Francis, tremendous ground attack during the last 
period reasserted the fact that the Plaid reserves cannot be 
counted on for much this year. It was through the second string 
line that the Francs consistently opened gaping holes in the 
closing moments.
Carnegie, however, was obviously at a greater disadvan
tage than their opponents due to the intense heat. St. Francis 
two platoon system kept them somewhat fresher than the lo
cal squad, consequently the Scots coasted from time to time 
after they had established their lead.
The Tartans are tangling with a rough opponent which 
promises to be up for the contest this Saturday. Franklin and 
Marshall, who took a drubbing from Lehigh and then dropped 
a one point decision to Johns Hopkins, were tied last week 
by Dickinson, 13-13. The Diplomats, coming closer to shaking 
their losing ways each time out, will be counting on Dr. Eddie 
Baker's squad to provide them with the streak breaker.
Despite the vast difference in records, the Tartans will 
enter the game as underdogs again. Each of Carnegies op
ponents seems to become progressively stronger and F&M is 
no exception. AVith little moral support from the stands, the 
Scots will have a full afternoonswork ahead of them.

Soccer Team Prepares For 
Opening Game At Frostburg
Addition of several experienced players to the soccer team in 
the past week gives further indication that the squad is headed to
ward a successful season.
Mazza Workneh, a native of Ethopia, who learned the fundamentals of soccer in that country, 
is now practicing with the team. 
George Fieldman, outstanding at 
outside left last season and Tom 
Edson, former preparatory school 
player, are also working out.
New Style Featured 
Three experienced Latin Amer
ican boys, George Hasfura, Henry 
Kannee, and Armando Gusanti, 
promise to give variety to the 
teams style of play. The game, as 
played south of the border, fea
tures a short passing attack with 
more emphasis on watching the 
ball and placement of the next 
kick. Some of these fellows ap
pear certain to make the first 
team.
Coach Pat OConnor has been 
greatly encouraged by the im
provement the boys have shown 
in practice since training started, 
and with the form displayed in a 
practice game with Western Penn
sylvania Institute for the Deaf, 
Although he declines to hazard an 
opinion on how the team will fare 
for the season, he has high hopes 
of turning in a winning record. 
Opener To Be Rugged 
The season opener on October 
15 is at Frostburg, Maryland, with 
the Frostburg Teachers who an
nually produce a powerful team 
It is the only major sport at that 
school and they field a team of 
husky, rugged boys playing a fast 
combination game. It promises to 
be a thrilling match, with Car

setback.
First home games will be Octo
ber 22 with Slippery Rock and 
October 29 with Oberlin. Both 
games will be played on the Skibo 
soccer field.

Delta Tau Delta was never

Theta Pi team. Final score  
DTD 27; BTP 6.
Delta Upsilon battled Alpha Tau 
Omega to an 8-9 score at half time 
but an ATO touchdown in the 
third period spelled defeat for

Blocked Kick Costly
Sigma Alpha Epsilon took it on 
the chin from Tau Delta Phi all 
through the first half of their 
game *ast Thursday; however the 
SAEs bunched two scores in the 
third period and came out on top. 
The winning tally came after Arne 
Oberg had sparked the SAE at
tack down to the Tau Delt 2% 
yard line, from which he tossed to 
Siefers for the TD. Trailing 18-11, 
the Tau Delts rushed the SAE 
backs furiously and as Oberg 
dropped back to punt on fourth 
down, Sherm Lieberman charged 
in and blocked the kick.
minor injuries to give the crowd 
of ome 3000 a great display of 
running and passing. He passed 
for one score and carried over two 
personally while Jack Magnifico 
provided the final tally on a pass 
interception.
Heat Takes Toll 
The heat of the day was once 
again a big factor in the pattern 
of play. The Tartans with few 
adequate substitutes at their dis
posal found themselves wilting in 
the closing part of the game. Only 
a substantial lead, made possible 
in part by Wes Kenneys four 
successful conversions, allowed 
the Scots to coast into the win.
St. Francis two platoon system 
saved them from some of the 
effects of the heat, but by the close 
of the contest they too were slow
ing down their attack.
Statistics With Losers 
Statistics gave the advantage to 
the losers in every department 
except punting, a complete re
versal of last weeks figures. Tom 
Haney and Elmer Metzger got off 
punts for an average of more 
than 42 yards for the Plaid.
A sluggish and scoreless first 
quarter was suddenly broken up 
when the Carnegie offense came 
to life in the opening minutes of 
the second stanza. On the third 
play Simcic carried 18 yards for 
a first down on the St. Francis 31 
yard line. Sommer missfired on a 
pass and Luchok picked up one 
through tackle.
Simcic took a lateral from Som
mer and heaved a perfect touch
down pass to Fritz Wilson who 
caught the ball over his shoulder 
on the goal line.
Simcic Leads Attack 
The second tally midway in the 
second quarter was all Simcic. 
The talented halfback recovered 
an enemy lateral on his own 20 
yard line. Haney and Sommer 
combined to pick up 4 yards 
through the middle of the line.
It was then that the hard driv
ing star of the game swept right 
end, cut back behind his blockers, 
and broke into the secondary. With 
a quick reversal of his field Simcic 
picked his way through the Francs 
baekfield and broke into the clear 
to race 76 yards for the tally.
The Plaid took the kickoff fol
lowing a St. Francis score after 
the half and drove 64 yards to a 
third touchdown. With a first down 
on the opposition ten, Simcic car
ried three out of four times an 3 
rammed the ball over from the 3 
on the final down.
Magnifico intercepted a John 
Klock pass midway in the final 
period and galloped 55 yards for 
the last Carnegie score of the day.

Morty Baker Wins 
Semi-Final Tennis 
Match By 6-2, 6-1
OF Man Weather swung a damp 
racquet and forced temporary 
postponement of the finale in the 
23 man intramural tennis tourna
ment. In a previous match Morty 
Baker scored an easy semi-final 
victory over George Berringer, 
6-2, 6-1, to reach the finals. His 
opponent will be the winner of the 
rained out semi-final match be
tween Herb Zischkau and Bob 
Hocker.
While the final rounds of the in

way. This will pair all varsity and 
non-varsity tennis players at 
Carnegie.
Jeannette Harriers Win 23-32 
Decision From Tartan Runners
In an informal opener Carnegie Techs cross country team drop
ped a 23-32 decision to the strong Jeannette Harriers over the 
Schenley Park course last Saturday morning.
Two Houser brothers placed*------------------------------------------------*
one and two for the Harriers to 
practically assure victory. John 
Cooper in fourth spot was the 
first Plaid runner to cross the fin
ish of the four mile course. His 
time of 22:39 was eight seconds 
better than Captain Gene Cockrell.
Jackie Alberts finished sixth at 
23:31 while Skip Mitchell and Car
man rounded out the Carnegie 
scoring in 8th and 9th positions.
Opener On Saturday 
Coach Guy Halferty is now busy 
preparing his charges for their in
tercollegiate opener at Franklin 
and Marshall next Saturday.
Mitchell, a transfer student who 
is inelligible for competition due 
to the resident rule, will be un
able to compete. It is probable 
that McElhany will thus become 
the Tartans number five man.
The following week the squad 
will again accompany the football 
team in their trip to Cleveland to 
meet Case Tech.

of the Week for his brililant per
formance in Carnegies 28 to 19

Meyers was outstanding in his 
defensive play against the hard 
charging St. Francis squad. He 
kept passers Danny Marchitello 
and Eddie Del Grande on the run 
and stopped several of the vis
itors offensive thrusts at crucial 
points.
A leader in student activities on

Wheres Your Spirit?
The annual Insignia Award banquet sponsored by Evening 
Student Council was held on Saturday evening, September 24. 
Twenty-seven awards were presented to those who had par
ticipated in extra curricular activities last year. We were 
pleased to see the increase over last year in the number of 
v&wards, but we lose spirit when we note that most of the 
awardees were either Student Council members or members of 
the Plaid staff.
Surely there are more students in evening school who could 
participate actively in the extra curricular work of the school. 
True, there arent as many activities to take part in as in for
mer years, but with ;the few workers who do turn out, the work 
available is more than enough to keep them busy.
If the student body were to show an increase in interest in 
these out-of-class activities, we are positive that Student Coun
cil would be quick to add more affairs to the evening school 
social calendar.
Should the students show, a worthwhile interest in the so
cials scheduled for this semester and express their desire for 
more of the same we are sure that additions could be made to 
next semesters social calendar. These additions do not neces
sarily have to be dances. If there are other activities that you 
WOuld care to participate in, Council would be more than will
ing to consider your requests.
The burden of proof in this matter is on your shoulders.

Total evening school enrollment 
this year was practically the same 
as that of the previous school year.
Marked changes have occurred 
in the enrollment of the different 
departments. The Engineering and 
Science school has 794 enrolled at 
present compared to 766 the pre
vious year, showing an increase in 
interest in this particular depart
ment.
Humanistic, Social Studies, I. A., 
Printing and General subjects 
have a very slight increase in at
tendance from 199 to 200.
Fine Arts department had a 
sharp decline. The attendance in 
this department has decreased 
from 305 of the 47-48 year to 270 
of the present year. Margaret 
Morrison enrollment also dropped 
from 22 to 17.
The sum total of the 48-49 year 
was 1292 compared to 1282 in 49- 
50.
This indicates that the evening 
school enrollment, has reached a 
stationary point from which more 
concise plans for all students ac
tivities can be decided.

Plaid, is out of the way, and 
George Schussler and Bob Ell
strom have organized their staff, 
we can expect these fellows to 
give evening students a well bal
anced Plaid sheet. They also 
promise plenty of news items that 
will keep the evening group post

evening school campus.

Sigma Delta Phi held its first 
meeting of the school year, al
