Local police 
end robbers 
crime spree
by J.T. Trollman
Editor-in-Chief
One of the largest recent 
crime sprees to threaten college 
campuses around Oakland was 
brought to an end Tuesday night in 
an underground parking garage.
Carnegie Mellon campus 
police, University of Pittsburgh 
police, and local city precincts had 
been on the lookout for over two 
weeks for a suspect whom police 
thought to be behind 18 to 22 
armed robberies in the Oakland/ 
Shadyside area. Most of the 
robberies occurred between 8 pm 
and 12 pm. The search  which 
included an unmarked police 
vehicle patrolling the Oakland 
neighborhood  culminated at 
midnight on February 8, shortly 
following the commission of four 
armed robberies in the space of 
roughly one half hour.
Between 11:30 pm and his 
apprehension, the 22-yearold male suspect reportedly 
had robbed two female victims
 one at a PNC ATM at Fifth 
and Bellefield, and one in an 
apartment building  as well as 
two more victims, one at Forbes 
and McKee and one near the 
Quality Inn on the Boulevard of 
the Allies. Police began to pursue 
him, moving from the University 
of Pittsburghs main campus 
toward Magee-Womens Hospital. 
The suspect ran down the ramp of 
an underground parking lot and 
drew a loaded 9mm handgun. 
Police were able to apprehend 
him, but used a Taser in order to 
end the struggle.
The arrested man, already 
on parole for previous crimes, 
was supposed to be living in a 
halfway house in the North Side, 
and according to Lieutenant John 
Race of campus police, he will 
probably be spending a very long 
time in jail. At the time of his 
capture, the man was found with 
$1300 in stolen money, a 9mm 
handgun, and several victims

In the past few weeks, tensions 
have risen among several interna
tional interest groups on campus, 
bringing the Israel-Palestine and 
India-Pakistan divisions close to 
home.
On January 26, the Fence was 
painted in celebration of Indias 
Republic Day, The next day it was 
taken for the country of Pakistan.
To some students, such as 
first-year English major Eunjung 
Kwon, it seemed like a Fence war. 
Before, I felt like [only] the gov
ernments just hated each other, 
she said, but now it seems like 
theres friction among the stu
dents too.
Such friction has spread to 
students in support of Israel or 
Palestine as well. According to 
Rachel Svinkelstin, a senior phi
losophy major and the president 
of Hillel, the recent on-campus 
conflict between Israeliand 
Palestinian-interest groups ini
tially started because of several 
anti-Israeli speakers scheduled to 
appear on campus. In February 
three speakers  Ali Abunimah, 
Norman Finkelstein, and Malik 
Zulu Shabazz, all of whom have 
focused on the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict in past speeches  were 
scheduled to speak at Carnegie 
Mellon. All three of them are 
vehemently anti-Israel, some just 
more vehemently than others, 
said Svinkelstin, also the presi
dent and co-founder of the stu
dent group Tartans for Israel.
Several student organizations, 
including the Carnegie Mellon 
Students for Justice in Palestine 
and the Pittsburgh Palestine 
Solidarity Committee, are orga
nizing Abunimah and Finkelstein 
with CMU funding. SPIRIT is 
hosting Shabazz.
Many students oppose 
Svinkelstin. Coming to CMU, I 
realized how little is truly known 
about the systematic methods the
since then. The 2001 book was 
released nearly six months after 
its August target date. In a let
ter delivered with each book, 
David Salinas, editor-in-chief of 
the Thistle in 2001 and 2002, 
explained why. One critical mis
take involved the Senior Portrait 
section, in that portraits were not 
correctly assigned to the proper 
student, stated Salinas.
The delay did not go unno
ticed. In the February 4, 2000, 
edition of The Tartan, Salinas was 
quoted as saying that he would

The Order of Omega, which 
has been a part of Greek life 
on campus for over 10 years, 
has returned after a one-year 
hiatus. The Order may be un
familiar to those outside the 
Greek community, especially 
those who were first-years last 
year. However, this year the Or
der has elected a new executive 
board and renewed its presence 
on campus.
Misty Muscatel, a senior in 
business administration, is the 
current president of the Order 
of Omega. She describes the 
organization as an honors so
ciety that really prides itself on 
scholarship. When the Order 
returned to campus this year, 
interested members  includ
ing Muscatel, Greek Council 
President Erin Weber, and fifthThe Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (TUGV) is designed to be used by the military as a remote reconnaisance aid, as well as for defense. Weighing one ton, the Gladiator can be controlled with a remote control. Carnegie 
Mellon received a $24.6 million grant to continue development and construction of the vehicle.
Carnegie Mellon University 
trumped Lockheed Martin this 
past week when researchers at 
CMUs Robotics Institute won a 
design and development con
tract from the U.S. government. 
The win signals an an age in 
which investors realize that edu
cational institutions can innovate 
just as well as  or better than 
 multinational corporations.
Last Monday, CMU representa
tives were notified that they had 
won a $26.4 million government 
contract to design and develop 
what may become the future of 
battlefield reconnaissance and 
defense: the Gladiator Tactical 
Unmanned Ground Vehicle, 
or TUGV. Carnegie Mellon re
searchers have been working on 
stages of the project since 2002.
Weighing one ton and rest
ing on six wheels, the Gladiator 
is controlled remotely and
Israeli forces are using to deprive 
Palestinians of any sort of normal 
existence, said Hanadie Yousef, 
a first-year chemistry major and 
co-president of the Arab Student 
Organization. As a result of the 
lack of the Palestinian perspec
tive in the media and on cam
pus, we decided to put together 
a Palestine Awareness series, 
to attempt to educate the pub
lic on what is actually going on 
in Palestine and what affect the 
U.S.s monetary support is having 
on the conflict.
In response, the Israeli 
groups took a stance against the 
speakers coming. The whole 
purpose of bringing speakers to 
campus is to promote a healthy 
dialogue. We dont [think] its 
promoting something healthy, 
said Svinkelstin. Members of 
Hillel and Tartans for Israel 
attended Abunimahs February 
3 speech to protest. We came 
out at Abunimah because we feel 
a lot of what he said was lies, 
Svinkelstin said. A lot of his ideas 
are very inflammatory. It doesnt 
matter if youre right wing or left 
wing, theyre very hurtful, very 
divisive .... There is a thin and 
dangerous line between antiIsraeli and anti-Jewish.
To find common ground, the 
groups met with Jennifer Church, 
Associate Dean of Student Affairs. 
Last Wednesday, members of the 
opposing organizations met to 
discuss how to disagree peacefully 
on issues in the Middle East. The 
students in attendance included 
Svinkelstin; Mika Larrison, a 
senior in design and co-founder 
of Tartans for Israel; Nur Azlina 
Abdul Aziz, a senior majoring 
in biomedical engineering, civil 
engineering and psychology and 
co-founder of CMU Students for 
Justice in Palestine; and Nick 
Sawaya, a graduate student in 
chemical engineering from the 
Pittsburgh Palestine Solidarity 
Committee. The groups decided

Over the past three years, 
lengthy delays have afflicted 
Carnegie Mellons student year
book. At times it has only been 
sustained by a single student: 
Joshua Chaise, a senior mechani
cal and biomedical engineering 
major whose continuing work 
has put the organization on track 
to deliver this years yearbook on 
time.
Technical issues, low staffing, 
and a vacuum of organizational
structure have left the newest 
editors little guidance in get
ting the Thistle out to the hun
dreds of seniors, parents, and 
alumni who order one 
every year. With a new 
staff of 14 students, 
mostly first-years,
Chaise is working to 
finish the 2004 year
book and start work 
on this years edition.
Warning signs of the This
tles troubles began to appear in
2000. Before then, it was custom
ary that the yearbooks managing 
editor would inherit the editorin-chief position. Sam FerraroPollak, editor-in-chief in 2000, 
had no managing editor, and left 
Elsi Lampl, then a sophomore 
in professional writing, in 
charge. Also that year, 
the Thistles advisor 
left Carnegie Mellon. 
With inexperienced 
leadership and no ad
visor, the Thistle was 
on a shaky foundation.
The yearbooks schedule 
started to slip significantly in
2001, kicking off a number of 
delays that have affected the 
Thistles publication schedule

Riesselman  helped to re
vamp its structure. Riesselman 
compiled applications for those 
who wished to be members, ac
cording to Muscatel. [Erin and 
I] were very adamant about 
bringing it back to campus. We 
really pushed and tried to see if 
people were interested in doing 
it, Muscatel said.
The Order has an executive 
board of four members, includ
ing Muscatel, junior ECE major

At last Thursdays general body 
meeting, the Undergraduate Student 
Senate approved a referendum on a 
$5-per-semester newspaper fee. This 
referendum will be put to a vote during 
this years student government elections, 
which will occur in late March or early 
April. The new fee would enable student 
government to provide local and national 
newspapers to students each weekday 
morning.
You may recall that Student 
Government ran a trial of the Collegiate 
Readership Program last year from 
October 11 through November 5. During 
this period, free copies of The New York 
Times, USA Today, and the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette were made available at 
five distribution points around campus. 
The student response to this trial was 
overwhelmingly positive, prompting 
Student Senate to approve a newspaper 
fee referendum.
If this referendum passes by a majority 
vote of the undergraduate student 
body, about 1700 newspapers would be
distributed at various locations around 
campus, including the University Center, 
every major academic building, and many 
of the larger dormitories. There would be 
a significant increase in both the number 
of distribution points and the number 
of newspapers distributed. Accordingly, 
student government will work with 
Carnegie Mellon Green Practices to 
increase the number of newspaper 
recycling bins across campus.
The Collegiate Readership Program 
was started in 1997 at Pennsylvania 
State University and has since spread to 
over 300 other colleges and universities
across the country. Such programs allow 
students to be more informed about 
local, national, and international current 
events, developing a better climate for 
the exchange of ideas.
Please cast your vote in this referendum 
during student government elections 
later this year.
If you have any questions or comments 
about the newspaper fee referendum or the 
Collegiate Readership Program, please visit 
the Student Body President during his office 
hours  Wednesdays from 4:30 to 6:30 pm 
in UC 318F or e-mail pres@cmu.edu.

Its easy to get tunnel vision when 
the semester is in mid-swing. Lifechanging events happening on the 
other side of the Earth can pass 
unnoticed here. Storms dumped more 
than six feet of snow in Tajikistan last 
Friday, but conversations in the UC 
didnt touch the subject. Tsunami 
relief fundraising on the tiny island 
nation of Tonga yielded $22,887 
 the per capita income is a mere 
$2000 there  but I didnt overhear 
anyone mention it on the 61C.
For all practical purposes, theres 
really no reason for us to hear of 
these events. But every now and 
then, its good to get a taste of whats 
happening in a place most people 
have never been and will never go.
A prime example right now is amid 
the Himalayas, in Nepal. On February 
1, the King Gyanendra called an end 
to the nations second attempt at 
democracy. In one bold move, the 
king reclaimed absolute power when 
he sacked the elected prime minister 
and dissolved the parliament.
The Kingdom of Nepal is the 
worlds only Hindu state; it is home 
to Mount Everest and the Himalayas; 
and, on a personal level, Nepal was 
my home for three months in 2003. 
Reading an article about the royal 
coup on February 2, I was worried 
for my friends.
For nine years, the Royal Nepal 
Army has been fighting a civil war 
against Maoist rebels. The leaders 
of the rebel group took part in the 
first parliamentary elections in 
1990, but they were disillusioned 
by corruption and bickering. They 
claim to be fighting for the Nepali 
peoples chance to freely determine 
their government, but 11,000 people 
have died in the violence.
The conflict has decimated Nepals 
economy, leaving many without 
a reliable income. The Maoists 
routinely protest government actions 
with enforced nationwide that bring 
the nations economy to a halt. Now, 
43 percent of the population lives 
below the poverty line.
Peter Moran, an American 
professor who has lived in Nepal for 
five years, sent an e-mail to his friends 
and former students. He reported 
that most Nepalis with whom he had 
spoken in Kathmandu supported the 
kings move. He wrote that, Many 
people feel that the political parties 
have acted only selfishly during the 
whole long period of democracy, 
and have stolen from the people.
Two days later after, I heard from 
my friend Rejan, whose family I lived 
with in Kathmandu. In my opinion, 
whatever the king did was good, 
he wrote. He has announced that 
within three years he would establish 
peace in the country, and I do think 
this will yield a positive result.
Still, the kings motives are 
questionable. Some speculate that 
Gyanendra was behind the murder 
of his brother, the former king. Since 
February 1, Gyanendra has ordered 
the detainment of many politicians, 
journalists, and activists, has banned 
public gatherings, and cut off the 
Internet and international telephone 
lines.
The common sentiments among 
all the Nepali people I met while 
traveling in the country were 
exhaustion and helplessness. They 
are tired of the fighting. All we 
can do is hope for good, a young 
Nepali mother told me as a military 
helicopter flew overhead.
Nepal needs to find its unity. 
While Nepal is home to Hindus and 
Buddhists, dozens of distinct ethnic 
groups, and even more political 
parties, there are strong connections 
among the people of Nepal. If those 
in power would set their greed aside 
and allow harmony to set in, this 
nation  already so rich in culture 
and natural splendor  could be 
peaceful and prosperous.
As we turn back to our textbooks 
and problem sets, lets keep in mind 
that as small as it may seem, the 
world is big enough for us to let most 
of it slip by unnoticed.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 14, 2005
Greek honors 
society revived 
after hiatus
OMEGA, from A1
initiated in March of this year.
Though the Order of Omega is an 
honors group, it distinguishes itself 
from other honors societies by limiting 
its prospective applicants to juniors or 
seniors involved in Greek life. Accord
ing to a publicity flyer, the Order rec
ognizes those students who have at
tained a high standard of leadership in 
inter-Greek activities. Applicants must 
display examples of their involvement 
in creating community within fraterni
ties and sororities as well as through 
scholarship, leadership, and service. 
In addition to these goals, Weber 
stated, Omega unites members from 
all houses into a single organization. 
That interaction facilitates communi
cation and learning from one another. 
Though Weber is not a member of the 
executive board, she holds a place on 
the scholarship committee.
Singelyn also pointed out the ben
efits of a multi-Greek organization. I 
became involved in Order of Omega be
cause I wanted a chance to be more in
volved in the Greek community beyond 
my own house, she stated. I see Order 
of Omega as a group of role models.
This year the Order of Omega has 
created a philanthropic plan that will 
help those in the Greek community. The 
Order will hold several events, includ
ing a bake sale on February 18, to raise 
money for scholarships. The money 
raised from the events sponsored by 
the Order of Omega will ultimately go 
to a scholarship program that will help 
younger members of the community 
pay their fraternity or sorority dues. 
The winner, Muscatel pointed out, 
would not be eligible to join the Order 
of Omega, but would rather be drawn 
from either the first-year or sopho
more class. The winner must be highly 
involved in the Carnegie Mellon and 
Greek communities.
Muscatel noted that the largest 
change about the Order of Omega 
since its reappearance on campus this 
year is its emphasis on involvement at 
Carnegie Mellon beyond Greek life. 
Were a group of motivated individuals 
who want to get out and get things done 
for CMU, she said.

THISTLE, from A1
document the yearbook pro
duction process and expressed 
confidence in the future of the 
publication. He also cited the 
presence of a new advisor. Nei
ther Salinas nor the advisor, 
Dan Barnett, stayed long, how
ever, depriving the publication 
of a chance to benefit from ex
perienced leadership. This was 
indicative of a problem that has 
persisted within the Thistle: it 
has had three advisors in just 
the last four years.
According to Chaise, Salinas 
resigned later that year, claim
ing academic overload. It is un
clear what happened between 
Salinas resignation and the 
summer of 2003. Chaise said 
editors started to quit the pub
lication in large numbers after 
it became known that little 
or no work was done on the
2002 yearbook. Pages were 
never integrated into the rest 
of the yearbook, said Chaise. 
Matters were complicated by a 
hard drive failure. Its hard to 
say how much was lost; it was a 
nightmare to find those pages. 
Salinas could not be reached 
for comment. Without a cen
tralized backup of the files, 
Chaise was forced to recon
struct the lost portions from 
scratch, adding months to the 
production time.
The Office of Student Ac
tivities, in an effort to help 
the Thistle, hired one of the 
graduating yearbook editors, 
Luis Cota, to finish the 2002 
edition. Chaise said Cota did 
not stay until the book was 
done, leaving his position with 
Student Activities for other 
employment in the summer of 
2003. According to Heather 
Andring, Barnetts successor as 
the Thistles advisor, the 2002 
book was distributed in August 
after a delay of one year. 
During that summer, Barnett 
offered Joshua Chaise the 
editor-in-chief position. With 
only a couple of photographers 
and a new advisor to help him, 
Chaise accepted.
Andring became the Thistle.s 
advisor shortly after. I dont 
know the full extent of what 
happened or why it happened 
or who did it... but it was in a 
bad place.
Next week, The Tartan will 
continue the Thistles story in

TENSIONS, from Al
to postpone Finkelsteins speech 
until March 14, allowing time 
for Hillel and Tartans for Israel 
to invite for their own speaker 
in the meantime.
We felt like in one month of a 
time span, we were really being 
hit on all sides with all these 
different issues. But Finkelstein 
was who really did it because 
of his claims about Holocaust 
survivors and WWII restitu
tion, said Svinkelstin. Its not 
so popular these days to be an 
activist for Israel, but thats why 
its all the more important for us 
to stand up for what we believe 
is the truth and what we stand 
for. But Finkelstein took it in a 
whole other direction by gener
alizing Holocaust survivors as 
thieves.
While there are repeated 
claims that these speeches are 
lies, hurtful, offensive or divi
sive, we must not allow these 
tactics to silence free speech on
our campus and instead let the 
students and audience decide. 
Norman Finkelstein... speaks as 
one Jewish perspective against 
Israel not because he has a right 
to be heard but because the 
students have a right to hear. 
remarked Aziz. To say that 
Norman Finkelstein, a careful 
researcher, is speaking alone 
and his words are mere propa
ganda and lies is unjustified.
Referring to any potential 
pro-Israeli speakers brought to 
campus, Yousef commented, I 
only hope that pro-Israeli stu
dents will give future lecturers 
and human rights activists the 
same respect and observe the 
right to freedom of speech. 
Currently both sides are 
working toward an agree
ment. The dialogue is open, 
and I hope it continues, said 
Svinkelstin.
The conflict between Indian 
and Pakistani students is slight
ly less heated. As a first-gener
ation Indian, Im pretty neutral
about the India and Pakistan 
situation, said junior computer 
science major Latika Kirtane. I 
think that most of the feelings 
of hatred that we have were 
handed down by our parents. 
Theres no reason to feel bitter 
about things now.
Indias post-constitution years 
have been marked by clashes 
with Pakistan, which was born 
of the subsequent partition of 
the continent in 1947. In rough
ly 60 years, India and Pakistan 
have had three wars.
Other students, such as firstyear design major Justin Lau, 
see the situation differently. I 
dont think that anyone cares 
whats on the Fence anyway, 
he said.
I think that everyones enti
tled to free speech, said firstyear design major Kyle Overton. 
It wasnt really a Fence war 
because it would have been no 
different if a group like, say, the 
College Republicans took the 
Fence.

Pittsburgh researchers power artificial heart with muscle
by Jess OHara
Junior Staffwriter
Imagine harnessing the energy 
of your muscle contractions to cre
ate a renewable source of energy 
that could keep an artificial heart 
pumping. This is the goal of a 
research initiative taking place at 
Pittsburghs Allegheny General 
Hospital, where researchers in 
the Division of Cardiothoracic 
Surgery Research are developing 
an internal biological battery 
that will power an implant
able cardiac assist device.
The product of 
collaboration between 
biomedical engineer 
Dennis Trumble, M.S. 
and surgeon James 
MacGovern, M.D., this 
muscle energy converter has 
the potential to provide patients 
with a more economical and 
physically manageable alterna
tive to the pricey and cumber
some cardiac-assist devices fre
quently used today. [This device] 
converts the mechanical energy 
of skeletal muscle contraction to 
hydraulic energy that can run a 
heart pump, said Trumble. The 
device exclusively uses the latissimus dorsi back muscle to gen
erate power. Repeated stimula
tion by electrical impulse allows 
this muscle to be trained and 
become more fatigue resistant. 
The trained muscle can then be 
used as the dependable energy 
source to maintain an 
implantable cardiac 
assist device.
Prior to 1992, 
the Division of 
Cardiothoracic 
Surgery
ing it to pump. The procedure 
was implemented in 34 patients, 
but ultimately the project was 
abandoned because the blood 
supply to the muscle eventually 
diminished
The recipient of over $4 mil
lion dollars of National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) funding, this 
research initiative has been in 
place for almost fifteen years. 
Currently in its sixth genera
tion, the device has been suc
cessfully implanted in 
canines. Future trials will
Research 
was focused 
on a surgical proce
dure called dynamic cardio myo
plasty. This technique relocated 
the trained latissimus dorsi muscle 
and wrapped it directly around 
the heart. Muscle contractions 
would compress the heart causand became unable to make the 
heart pump. The basic principle 
of a muscular energy source was 
maintained, and researchers have 
found that the muscle functions 
more efficiently and for much 
longer periods of time when it 
remained in its original location.
test the 
long
term 
endurance of 
the trained skeletal 
muscle and the success of con
necting it to a blood pump in ani
mals. Clinical trials with human 
patients will soon follow.
Annually, 4.9 million Ameri
cans suffer from congestive 
heart failure (CHF). This con
dition involves the weakening
of the heart muscle to such an 
extent that it can no longer effec
tively pump to meet the bodys 
oxygen demand and generally 
results in an enlarging of the 
heart.
In 2002, heart failure as a 
result of CHF was the cause of 
roughly 53,000 deaths. 
These annual rates have 
not decreased in the past 
two decades, 
according to 
Molly Francis, a 
representative 
of the American 
Heart Associa
tion. According to 
Francis, this is alarming consid
ering that the number of suc
cessful transplants has remained 
stagnant at about 2000 per year 
for the past fifteen years.
The demand then for effi
cient cardiac assist devices 
is only becoming greater as 
time goes on. In a May 2004 
press release, MacGovern 
said, In addition to the limi
tations of heart transplanta
tion relative to organ availabil
ity, the serious risks associated 
with transplantation ... make 
the prospect of a reliable, com
pletely implantable device that 
reinforces the natural heart 
extremely appealing.
New processor 
by IBM set to 
capture market
by Nicole Hayward
Junior Staffwriter
On February 7, IBM, Toshiba, Sony 
Computer Entertainment (SCEI), and 
presented a revolutionary microprocessor, 
the Cell, claiming it can process with ten 
times the capability of current processors. 
Creators plan to use it soon in Sonys 
Playstation 3, expected to be released in 
2006, and in Toshiba High Definition tele
visions.
This is probably going to be one of the 
biggest industry announcements in many 
years, said Richard Doherty, president of 
the Envisioneering research firm to The 
Financial Times. Only about the size of a 
quarter, the Cell can run at 4.5 GHz. The 
Cells speed can be attributed to its multi
cored architecture.
The cell has eight processing cores that 
its creators call Synergistic Processing 
Elements (SPEs). The Cells SPEs have 
256 KB cache memory, an aid in quick 
memory access. Although processors with 
a single core may execute several instruc
tions at once, they produce more heat and 
consume more energy than multicore pro
cessors. In a multicore processor, several 
instruction threads can be processed in par
allel. These processing cores are connected 
by a common bus, codenamed Redwood 
by producers, that can run at 6.4 GHz.
Intel currently produces the microproces
sor with the fastest clock speed: 3.8 GHz.

Technologies Group at Intel who spoke to

How Things Work: The food science of yogurt
by William Nicoll
Staffwriter
Did you know the aver
age Frenchman eats about 
20 kilograms of yogurt a 
year? Thats 120 containers! 
Yogurt is a dairy food that 
has gained widespread popu
larity over its long history. 
Its origins date back about 
4000 years to the wilderness 
of the Caucasus Mountains. 
It is believed that a Turkish 
nomad left milk outside on 
a hot summer day  and a 
foul predecessor of what we 
love today was born. Some 
even believe yogurts recipe 
was given to the biblical fig
ure Abraham by an angel. 
It appears worldwide under 
various names: filmjolk, kefir, 
koumiss, lassi,ymer. But what 
makes yogurt so popular?
To understand why we 
enjoy yogurt so much, it 
helps to understand how 
it is made. Yogurt begins 
its life as milk. Though any 
mammalian milk could be 
used  goat, llama, cat, 
human  cows milk is used 
primarily today. The milk 
must be carefully screened 
for sterility, particularly from 
bacteria and bacteria-eating 
viruses known as bacterio
phages.
The milk undergoes pas
teurization, which is a con
trolled heating that kills vir
tually all remaining microbes. 
Once pasteurized any desired
additives can be mixed  
artificial flavors, powdered 
milk to thicken the yogurt, 
and coloring to name a few.
Next, the solution 
endures homogenization. 
Homogenization forces the 
solution through small pas
sages at high pressure. Here
floating globules of fat are 
broken up into very small par
ticles by fluid stresses. This 
process is required because 
fat in unhomogenized milk 
will rise to the top of con
tainers if left sitting for long 
periods, as it does in Italian 
dressings on supermarket

shelves. Homogenization is 
complete when the mixture 
is a sterile and thoroughly 
mixed.
The next step begins with 
the addition of starter cul
tures, sources of bacteria

a test vehicle. In February 2004 
we deomonstrated a prototype in 
Quantico, said Apostolopoulos, 
where the Marines have a test
ing site. We did a second demon
stration in July 2004. The first of 
these tests focused on the mobil
ity of the Gladiator  its range, 
speed, and ability to negotiate 
terrain  while the second was 
primarily about its reconnais
sance and surveillance capabili
ties, said Apostolopoulos.
Don Smith, the vice-president of economic development 
for the University of Pittsburgh 
and Carnegie Mellon, said that 
focusing research on unmanned 
vehicles like the Gladiator TUGV 
demonstrated the militarys goal 
to keep American soldiers out of 
the line of fire. Under the Future 
Combat Systems Initiative, 
he said, the military is try
ing to change their vehicles to 
unmanned vehicles. The Future 
Combat Systems Initiative has 
a budget of over $100 billion, 
with the mission of revamping 
military hardware and network
ing interfaces to improve communication. The Gladiator is one 
result of this program, which 
seeks to increase the ratio of 
manned to unmanned vehicles 
to 3:1 by 2015. Its a reconnais
sance vehicle, said Smith.
Although the Carnegie 
Robotics Institute will design the 
Gladiator and develop its tech
nology, it has multiple partners 
to see the project through pro
duction. Since the beginning 
we tried to synthesize a team 
that has the right partners, said 
Apostolopoulos. We needed to 
have partners in this that would 
do, for instance, the communica
tion system for the robot, [and] 
other partners that would do the 
whole armoring for the vehicle. 
CMU researchers have partnered 
with defense contractor United 
Defense in order to produce up 
to 200 production units by 2007. 
Obviously making this deal with 
United Defense is critical... They 
will fabricate and produce this 
vehicle eventually.
United Defenses director 
of communications for their 
ground systems division, Herb 
Muktarian, said that his com
pany has been contracted to help
develop and manufacture two 
such autonomous vehicles for 
the military. The variant under 
contract with CMU, he said, 
will provide reconnaissance, 
surveillance and target acquisi
tion, while the second Assault 
variant will provide direct and 
indirect fire under remote con
trol in support of mounted and 
dismounted operations. United 
Defense has been working with 
Carnegie Mellon since late 2003.
Although in the past there 
have been student protests at 
CMUs Software Engineering 
Institute regarding the 
Universitys ties to military 
research, the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technologys Student 
Pugwash president Chris 
Sequeira said that was not his 
primary concern. Instead, 
he stressed that the Robotics 
Institute should be wary of con
tract stipulations and freedom 
of information regarding their 
research. Students and faculty 
must be allowed to decide for 
themselves if they really want to 
work for the military, he said. 
When asked what he thought of 
a university accepting military

grant funding, he replied: The 
simple fact of the matter is that 
[the Department of Defense] is a 
gigantic funding engine; manna 
from heaven is a bit hard to 
ignore.
The University has officially 
accepted the Gladiator grant, 
and will add the project to the 
Robotics Institutes growing 
list of projects accomplished in 
unmanned vehicles since 1984. 
The more important thing for
Carnegie Mellon, said Smith, 
is were seeing robotics technol

Not just in the military, but also

ples risk of developing cancer 
by one-third, according to a new 
study. In a study, 24 rats with precancerous tumors were divided 
into three groups: one group was 
fed only normal feed, another was 
fed normal feed with carrots, and 
the last was fed normal feed with 
falcarinol added. Rats in the car
rot and falcarinol groups were a

Multi-cored

CHIP, from A4
suspects that Intel is working 
on microprocessors of compa
rable speed. As of now, though, 
IBM, Sony, and Toshiba are the 
only companies with a released 
prototype of a microprocessor 
clocking at over 4 GHz.
Adding to its sophistication, 
the Cell processor has 234 mil
lion transistors, 109 million more 
transistors than todays average 
microprocessor.
Mark Kieler, Assistant 
Department Head for Under
graduate Affairs and Lecturer 
of Engineering and Public 
Policy, said, Only a prototype 
[of the Cell] has been demon
strated ... some things can go 
wrong: Their new smaller feature 
process might not pan out. This is 
apparently crucial to economical 
production of the chip. With a 
method called the 65-nanometer 
process, the Cells producers ex
pect to decrease the size of the cell 
and the cost of its manufacture.
Kieler, a CMU graduate with 
a degree in electrical engineer
ing, also said, Scheduling tasks 
among eight processors is a 
very difficult task to perform ef
ficiently. Producers of the Cell 
claim the processor can not only 
handle more tasks efficiently than 
the average microprocessor, but 
support several different operat
ing systems at the same time.

going to run many operating sys

Science puts bacteria to 
work in making yogurt
YOGURT, from A4
introduced into the milk that 
multiply and spread throughout 
its contents. The bacteria serve 
two purposes. The first is to pro
vide yogurt with its distinctive 
tangy taste. This taste isnt as 
prominent today because almost 
all yogurts sold domestically 
contain fruit. In fact, it wasnt 
until recently in yogurts his
tory  1947  that the Dannon 
Company introduced fruit on 
the bottom to increase yogurts 
popularity. Try eating a fruit on 
the bottom-type yogurt before 
mixing to taste the tanginess 
youve been missing.
Yogurt also requires bacte
ria for its texture. The multi
plication of bacteria begins the 
process whereby proteins form 
an internal structure called a
tank with precise temperature 
control that keeps it at about
110 degrees Fahrenheit. During 
the fermentation process the 
yogurt will reach its final consis
tency. The pH is carefully moni
tored during this time to achieve 
the optimal amount of fermen
tation. When fermentation is 
complete, the yogurt is quickly 
brought down to above-freezing 
refrigeration temperatures to 
stop bacterial activity.
At this point, one of sever
al things can happen. If pro
cessed as a set yogurt, it will 
have undergone all previous 
steps already in its container, 
ready to be sealed for storage. 
Otherwise, fruit preserves can 
either be added to the bottom 
of each container or be mixed 
Swiss style throughout the 
yogurt.
Though the production of yogurt has been 
thoroughly modernized, it is still the same 
process used for thousands of years.

teins gives yogurt its texture and 
viscosity  we wouldnt want to 
eat runny, slimy yogurt, would 
we?
Not just any bacteria can be 
used in this process, though. 
Id recommend refusing the 
yogurt cultured with E. coli by 
your biology-major roommate. 
The two most common bacte
ria used in yogurt culturing are 
Streptococcus thermophilus and 
Lactobacillus bulgaricus; these 
two species of bacteria are spe
cial because of their appetite 
for lactose, the sugar in dairy 
products. As these bacteria eat 
the lactose, they expel lactic 
acid as waste. It is the increas
ing concentration of lactic acid 
that is responsible for both 
the taste and the formation of 
coagulum.
The entire cycle of microbial 
division, lactic acid production, 
and protein lattice formation is 
accelerated by placing the for
mative yogurt in a fermenta
tion chamber  a stainless steel
In either case, manufacturers 
have the option of repasteurizing the containers. This would 
kill off remaining bacteria. If the 
bacteria are left alive, the yogurt 
must be declared an active cul
ture. Whether or not the manu
facturer produces active culture 
yogurt is a matter of consumer 
preference, though live cultures 
are purported to aid in digestive 
tract health. Once the decision 
is made, the yogurt is ready for 
shipment to supermarkets near 
you!
Though the production of 
yogurt has been thoroughly 
modernized, it is still fundamen
tally the same process used for 
thousands of years. Yogurt has 
been a staple for years in much 
of Europe and Asia, but it has 
only reached popularity in the 
U.S. within the last 50 years. 
For the yogurt-haters of the 
world, remember this: The 
next time youre forced to eat 
yogurt, take comfort in knowing 
it isnt spontaneously fermented

Assault on homosexuals in the 
media threatens Constitution
James Dobson, leader of Focus on the 
Family, denounces the animated charac
ter Spongebob Squarepants as promoting 
an unnatural normalization of homosex
uality. Conservative mores, usually with 
religious overtones, dictate an enmity 
for homosexuality and its acceptance. 
Those disapproving of homosexuality  
influential leaders like Dobson and Jerry 
Falwell  have the ears and pockets of 
government officials and are well within 
their rights to spread their opinions on 
the subject. However, they cross the 
threshold of morality when they and their 
organizations use their influence  elec
toral and financial  to get governmental 
bodies to censor opposing viewpoints.
The Constitution is being threatened 
and abused at the same time. Due to pres
sure from radical groups, the government 
has turned its attention from the wars 
on poverty and terror to wars on public 
libraries and PBS.
In one of her first acts as Secretary 
of Education, Margaret Spellings de
nounced PBS for funding an episode of 
the animated educational show Postcards 
from Buster that depicted lesbian couples 
maple sugaring in Vermont. Because of 
her comments, a producer of WGBH-TV 
in Boston pulled the episode from na
tional release, but still made it available 
on a station-by-station basis. The Boston 
station, along with those in Philadelphia, 
San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other 
cities, has decided that the show is fit 
for broadcasting and commensurate with 
Postcards original intention of promoting 
cultural diversity in the U.S.
Spellings claimed that the shows pro
moted a lifestyle not appropriate for tele
vision. The episode centers on agricul
ture. Homosexuality is not discussed, 
only implied in the background of the 
episode. Spellings also requested that
PBS return the funding used to air the 
episode and said that the department 
will be more closely overseeing public 
television content. The Department of 
Education is bound by the same censor
ship restrictions as Congress and should 
not prohibit the education of Americas 
youth because of paranoia about the idea 
of infectious homosexuality.
This fear has also been demonstrated 
by Alabama state representative Gerald 
Allen (R-Cottondale), who is determined 
to destroy the free exchange of ideas and 
undermine the first and 14th amend
ments of the U.S. Constitution. Lawmak
ers who tried unsuccessfully to ban gay 
marriage in his state want to prohibit use 
of state funds to purchase or house books 
referencing the homosexual agenda in 
any way, or any other materials or lec
tures that foster homosexuality.
Allen aims not only to remove books 
advancing a pro-homosexual argument, 
but also to remove books merely contain
ing a gay character in a minor role and 
textbooks that present a neutral view of 
the subject. The only mentions of homo
sexuality that would be permitted would 
be those condemning it.
Allen wants offending books to be de
stroyed, reminiscent of the Nazi bookburnings of the 1930s. The representa
tives goal is nothing but selective and 
immoral censorship: Strict interpretation 
of his regulations could empty libraries 
across the state.
Society does not need to be protected 
from a homosexual agenda; indeed if 
people want a pure society, it is cen
sorship that must be curbed. Govern
ment agencies are supposed to have the 
best interests of the public in mind when 
they make and execute laws; withholding 
viewpoints and information from the pub
lic cannot be in anyones best interests.

SPIRIT would like to address 
the concerns that have surfaced 
regarding the upcoming lecture of at
torney Malik Zulu Shabazz. The lec
ture to be held on February 17, 2005, 
titled An in-depth look at Black His
tory and the Role and Responsibility 
of the Black Community, is part of a 
celebration of Black History Month. 
Our intent in hosting the lecture is 
to educate and promote unity within
the black community here at Carnegie 
Mellon.
The views and opinions of attor
ney Shabazz do not necessarily reflect 
those of SPIRIT. As the only student 
organization that encourages black 
awareness on campus, we feel com
pelled to present diverse views that 
exist within the African-American 
community.
The aim of the organization is
not to offend any person or religion. 
We, as a group, only hope to give 
opportunities for students to hear and 
discuss views that might be contro
versial and different, yet still 
informative. We would hope that 
Shabazzs lecture will serve as a ve
hicle for open dialogue for all in at
tendance.
The members of SPIRIT
tion. Democrats outnumber Republi
cans 5-to-l and there hasnt been a 
Republican mayor in Pittsburgh since 
the 1930s. This dominance by the Dem
ocratic Party has led to complacency.
We have the opportunity to set a 
model for revitalizing the Democrats on 
a national level by shaking up the party 
on the local level. Replacing the old boy 
network currently entrenched in city 
politics with responsive leaders willing 
to work with an informed, engaged, 
creative electorate  of which students 
are a part  will be remarkably easy to 
accomplish when we work together.
Students are in a perfect position to 
set the agenda this year. We will be the 
ones to determine if we are going to 
have leadership who will fight to keep 
night and weekend bus service.
We will be the ones to set a dia
logue for reform in the city. We will 
be the ones to demand reform in the 
Democratic Party and a new way of 
doing politics in Pittsburgh. We will 
demand to see a positive campaign, and 
we will hold the candidates to a high 
standard of integrity. We will look to 
see that rationality and common sense 
become a critical component in govern
ment.
As students, we value a level of inde
pendence that often sets us apart from 
party politics. Many of us dont identify 
with either the Democrats or the Re
publicans, and thats why the highest 
levels of third-party and independent 
registrants come from campuses.
In order to take advantage of the 
power that weve already carved out 
for ourselves with our high level of
participation last year, we must vote in 
the mayoral election this year. Even if 
you dont identify with everything that 
the Democrats do on a national level, 
to have your voice heard, you must be 
registered as a Democrat. You can al
ways change your registration back on 
May 18.
In order to take control of the city 
elections, its critical that we get in
volved. We have to all be a part of the 
largest absentee ballot drive the city 
has ever seen. It is easy to be involved 
with any of the grassroots and student-centered organizations all around 
the city. Progress Pittsburgh (www. 
progresspittsburgh.org) is a recently or
ganized political action committee that 
is unifying many of the non-coordinated 
efforts from the fall election, and Ev
erybody VOTE (www. everybodyvote. 
com/students) will be active again in 
seeking high turnout and around elec
tion protection issues.
All of the mayoral campaigns are seek
ing volunteers, and at least one candi
date-focused organization  Students 
for Peduto {www.studentsforpeduto. 
org)  has recently been given nonfunded recognition on campus.
If theres one number that you should 
remember, its 699. Thats the number 
of votes that it took to win the mayoral election last cycle. We have the 1 
numbers to make the difference. Last 
mayoral election, turnout citywide was 
67,000.
We had 927 voters at Forbes-Schenley alone in November 2004, and with 
over 30,000 students in Pittsburgh, we 
are poised to take over city politics.
It might not have looked like it from 
where you sat last Election Day, but 
students at CMU were part of a huge 
victory for grassroots democracy. The 
political landscape in Pittsburgh has 
shifted. Students came out in record 
numbers, and collectively weve gained 
a certain amount of power and clout in 
a way that we never could have done 
individually.
May 17 is the first critical postNovember 2 election in the nation. 
Groups around the country, such as 
the League of Independent Voters and 
the National Hip-Hop Political Conven
tion, are looking to Pittsburgh as an 
early indicator of what the November
2 experience will mean nationwide for 
grassroots activism and student vote. 
We are the first major city to elect a 
mayor after being in the national spot
light last election.
The May 17 mayoral primary comes 
on the heels of a high-profile election 
in a high-profile region of a high-profile 
state. The importance of our region 
to the last election, and subsequent 
national attention, resulted in recordsetting voter registration and participa
tion among students.
The ward with the most newly 
registered voters in the city was our 
own. The campaigns have seen these 
numbers, too, and for the first time, 
there are mayoral candidates who are 
actively courting the student vote.
But arent the elections this spring 
just a primary? In Pittsburgh, the Dem
ocratic primary is the de facto elecTartans for Israel fail to protest 
speakers in appropriate fashion
Three speakers scheduled to speak at 
CMU this month  Ali Abunimah, Malik 
Zulu Shabazz, and Norman Finkelstein
 have prompted a newly-formed group 
called Tartans for Israel to take action. In 
trying to counter what they perceive to 
be an imbalance between pro and antiIsraeli speakers, their actions crossed the 
line from seeking greater representation 
for their views to trying to suppress the 
views of others.
Because of the speakers contemperaity, Tartans for Israels first move was 
to haphazardly paint the groups name 
over an announcement on the fence pub
licizing the Abunimah and Finkelstein 
lectures. While the group is as entided 
as any other to take the fence, their sole 
purpose seemed to be to cover up the ad
vertisements for the speakers.
When Abunimah came, the group 
organized a picket line outside Baker 
Hall before his lecture. As the lecture 
began, the group listened to Abunimahs 
argument  that a two-state solution 
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would 
create an apartheid system within Israel
 but, at the end, the protesters raised 
their signs again and walked out, ignor
ing Abunimahs invitation to a discus
sion.
Then, on Thursday, president Rachel 
Svinkelstin of Tartans for Israel ap
proached members of the Universitys 
administration in an effort to prevent 
Finkelstein from coming to CMU.
These are not the actions of a group 
dedicated to fostering cultural dialogue. 
A group earnestly contributing to a mar
ketplace of ideas should never seek to
silence the chosen lecturer of another 
student organization. Furthermore, 
Tartans for Israels actions have left some 
members of the Jewish community who 
were eager to hear the lectures feeling 
misrepresented and alienated.
Svinkelstin acknowledges that all 
groups should have the opportunity to 
bring speakers to campus, but says Tartans 
for Israel wants there to be a balance of 
speakers. However, a balance of speakers 
should not be the goal. If a group brings 
a speaker to discuss evolution, does the 
University need to ensure that a creation
ist follow up?
Vice Provost for Education Indira 
Nair, the administrator of the University 
Lecture Series, decided to postpone 
Finkelsteins lecture until March 14 and 
offered to include speakers suggested by 
Tartans for Israel in the University Lecture 
Series. The postponement of the lecture 
may be in hopes that everyone will be 
able to benefit from the lectures, as well 
as their opportunity for discussion. But in 
the future, it is important that there be 
a more comprehensive method of alert
ing the full range of student groups to 
the opportunity so none are taken by 
surprise.
Whether or not Tartans for Israel 
was aware of the opportunity to bring 
lecturers to campus, it is unacceptable 
for them to work against other student 
organizations that are bringing speakers 
to CMU. The Declaration of Unity event 
to be held before the Shabazz lecture may 
prove to be a step in the right direction 
for Tartans for Israel, but the group must 
not work to stymie the efforts of others.
Benjamin Hackett
Let it begin again, as the dawn of a 
new day, shining light on man, woman 
and child. Think that there has been 
more controversial and interesting ac
tivity on campus recently than ever 
before? Youre right. Thus, it is time 
to bring one up to speed. Enjoy these 
sorted light commentaries on the go
ings on throughout campus.
The local Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
continues in full force. Arab groups and 
Israeli groups continue to spar over 
speakers. The campus war has seen 
the exchange of many adamant Fencepaintings and other equally riled pro
tests and leafleting. The various Jewish 
groups staged a successful rally oppos
ing a speaker visiting campus. The voices 
are loud, and yet the swing-thinkers do 
not seem to care. Someone may wish to 
inform these groups that the PLO and 
the Israeli government signed a cease
fire. Perhaps these parties should do 
the same.
Controversial speakers keep getting 
booked, and then are subsequently sub
verted. The reasons for exclusion are 
cloudy at best. Sometimes, one argues 
that student funds should not be spent 
on speakers with obvious racist lean
ings, and that argument has substance. 
If the argument falls to Hes too nasty 
for me. I dont like him, and it is valid 
enough to warrant the non-funding and 
cancellation of speakers, then there is a 
problem. These groups should not con
tinue to stomp out freedom of speech 
due simply to political differences. Grow 
up, people; this country is the beacon of 
freedom and debate and progress. If 
you want totalitarian media control,
return to patronage of stations in these 
Middle Eastern nations that you hail as 
great places. These are countries where 
government controls media and people 
die on a regular basis for doing nothing 
other than their daily activities.
Fraternities and an expansive social 
scene continue to be on the Carnegie 
hit list, despite reassurances to the con
trary. Fall saw the formal killing off 
of Delta Tau Delta and Kappa Sigma. 
The fresh air of spring brings with it 
new sanctions and impossible demands. 
Hungry for more? Add a dash of social 
deformation reformation, a touch of 
moving sororities into the quad and 
a pinch of misplaced aggression, and 
you are cooking up a batch of New 
Quad. Any Greeks care to line up and 
take their medicine now? Or would you 
rather wait until the University order
lies are holding you down?
Senate is back in session. Is it time 
to duck and cover, or to pay attention? 
Fresh off of a mixed fall session of ec
centric expenditures, some complete 
misappropriations, and many exceed
ingly successful allocations, the student 
body is gearing up for a spring session. 
The JFC process is right around the 
corner; learn about it and understand 
where your $80 goes each semester. 
Scrutinize the numbers, and engage in 
debate. Never has there been a time in 
which the speakers have leaned more 
in one direction, or the student-funded 
debate been so one-sided. Does anyone 
else think its time to pull the political 
speakers funding rug from underneath 
the left-leaning and consistently slow 
feet of the Activities Board?
Elections are coming, but will the 
turnout come with it? Election rules
changes are in the works, and with 
them promises of a more reliable voting 
system and expedited results. Senate 
is attempting to take a more proactive 
role in communicating with an apa
thetic student body. The big question on 
peoples minds is the question of whom. 
Who will run for the student body presi
dential seat?
In the uber-important public relations 
realm (read: US News'), the rankings 
continue to rise in every area except 
student life. Pitt and Duquesne annu
ally outscore Carnegie Mellon in the 
campus life category. When 10 percent 
of your freshmen class is not returning, 
the trends are somewhat disturbing. 
The long-term implications might be 
being glanced over too easily when they 
should be studied. Are there short-term 
and long-term solutions out there? The 
fresh ideas seem to be lacking when it 
comes to social activities for under-21 
undergraduates. Remember what it was 
like to enjoy going to a football or a bas
ketball game in high school? Our mens 
basketball team is 14-5 (6-3 in con
ference). Our womens volleyball team 
has gone to six straight post-seasons. 
Our swimmers are in the conference 
championships. The point: Go to a 
damn game.
If this is supposed to be fun, let us 
have it. If this is supposed to be expan
sive, let us get started. There is some 
comfort to be taken in the reduced 
apathy. However, let there be balance 
and meticulous thought put into all 
these processes. If someone was not 
formerly up to speed, now they know. 
Enjoy these years through involvement; 
there is no satisfaction to be found on 
the sidelines.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 14, 2005
Racism on Hot 97 constitutionally protected, ethnically cruel
Alexander Su
Weve all heard about the huge tsunami 
that devastated the South Asian island 
countries. What you may not have heard 
is that last month, a show on one of the 
most popular hip-hop radio stations in 
New York, Hot 97, ran a skit called The 
Tsunami Song. To get a feel for what the 
song is all about, here are some lyrics: 
All at once you could hear the scream
ing chinks and no one was safe from the 
wave/there were Africans drowning/little 
Chinamen swept away/you could hear 
God laughing/Swim, you bitches, swim/ 
So now youre screwed/its the tsunami/ 
you better run or kiss your ass away/ go 
find your mommy/I just saw her float by/ 
a tree went through her head/and now the 
children will be sold to children slavery. 
After playing the song, one of the hosts 
on the show  who happened to be Asian
 protested the skit, and was in turn ac
cused of being an Asian supremacist.
Immediately following the release of 
the offensive skit, a great deal of protest 
came up from the Asian-American com
munity. Online petitions were posted, let
ters to companies that endorsed the show 
were sent out, and online blogs voiced the 
collective condemnation of this deplor
able skit. As a result, Miss Jones, the host 
of the show, issued an apology and her 
salary was suspended for a week.
This is not the first time in recent news 
an on-air personality has been guilty of ra
cial insensitivity. A month and a half ago, 
Las Vegas weatherman Rob Blair made a 
slip of the tongue, calling MLK day Mar
tin Luther Coon King Jr. Day. Ann Tripp, 
a host of a morning show on another 
popular radio station in New York, has 
poked fun at the Holocaust. Various radio 
personalities are also guilty of making 
questionable comments on the air, against 
all races and minorities; these are not a 
few isolated examples. Such remarks re
flect the not-so-subtle racism that exists in 
all of our minds. To accuse just these radio
personalities of being prejudiced would 
be an act of hypocrisy. Furthermore, any 
attempt to eradicate this inherent racism 
by enforcing politically correct termi
nology is simply laughable; governmental
censorship of comments like Miss Jones, 
no matter how flagrant they are, would 
be a serious violation of our First Amend
ment rights.
However, the case against Miss Jones
Danielle Saudino/Art Editor
and Hot 97 is not grounded in racism, 
but in decency. The death toll caused 
by the tsunami is at over two hundred 
thousand and rising. Bodies are still be
ing pulled out of the water. The argument 
that humor can be used to assuage the 
pains of this horrible tragedy is fallacious. 
You shouldnt use humor so soon after 
such an event, if at all. Yes, it is incred
ibly disrespectful to label the dead as 
chinks and Africans, but what is even 
more distressing is that the tragedy is 
still unfolding in the eyes of the victims. 
To rationalize the insensitive remarks as 
a method of numbing the pain is to pour 
salt into the proverbial wound. Imagine 
that, a few days following the September
11 attacks, a radio DJ had made fun of the 
victims and their families while throwing 
in a racist comment here or there. There 
is no doubt in my mind that the afore
mentioned DJ would not only lose his job 
but his reputation as well. Keep in mind 
that three thousand people lost their lives 
on 9/11. Over a hundred times as many 
have lost their lives in the aftermath of 
the tsunami.
Freedom of speech is a double-edged 
sword. While I strongly object to Miss 
Jones comments, I cannot seriously say 
that they should be kept off the air. Amer
ica was founded on dissent, and covering 
up unpopular opinions flies in the face of 
the principles upheld by the Constitution. 
Moreover, any punitive measure enacted 
by Hot 97 is for public relations purposes 
only. It is hardly believable that losing one 
weeks salary will prevent future offen
sive remarks. What is seriously disturbing, 
though, is that the weatherman who acci
dentally called Dr. King a coon ended up 
being fired. It seems that to attack a lion
ized figure, regardless of intent, warrants 
a more severe penalty than a deliberate 
racist attack on the plight of hundreds of 
thousands.
Alexander Su (asu@) is a senior social and 
decision science major. He believes that in 
order to eradicate racism from the airwaves, 
we need first to remove the prejudices we 
have in our own minds.Greeks need to end segregationist ways
Mark Egerman
I learned a long time ago not to 
listen when fraternity members 
insist that they dont receive the 
recognition they deserve and that 
everyone is out to get them. It 
seems to be a pathological kneejerk reaction based on a misun
derstanding of how non-Greeks 
see them. It always struck me as 
odd  almost as if the neighbor
hood kids were convinced that 
their secret clubhouse was going 
to get shut down.
Last week I was reminded that 
Greeks dont understand the crit
icism against them. In a letter to 
the editor, Tim Bowen, president 
of Sigma Nu, raised the same 
tired complaint that its time 
that the Greeks got the recogni
tion they deserve. If one were 
not reading carefully, one would 
assume that he was referring to 
yet more news regarding Greek 
blunders  you know, maybe 
another chapter had done some
thing it wasnt supposed to, the 
sort of thing that seems to oc
cur with stable frequency. Yet 
when you look at the situation, 
Bowens letter is indicative of a 
greater misunderstanding.
Let me provide the background 
in the simplest possible terms: 
A member of a CMU fraternity
drew a derogatory cartoon that 
portrayed women as subservient 
sex objects to fraternity brothers. 
I found the cartoon to be dis
gusting and Im glad that Bowen 
and the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil chose to distance themselves 
from it. Yet reading his letter 
shows me that at a fundamental 
level, the fraternities dont get it.
The whole basis of the letter
doors to entire groups of people 
should not be tolerated.
For the record, the Greek sys
tem doesnt have a great history. 
Few fraternities admitted Jews 
and blacks until the 70s and 80s. 
Id like to remind readers that 
when Trent Lott was president 
of his chapter of Sigma Nu in 
the 60s, he successfully fought to 
keep Sigma Nu segregated.
undermine its own policy by 
leasing its housing to any stu
dent organization that violates 
the Statement of Assurance. 
The University owns all of the 
houses on the fraternity quad, 
and it has the right to lease them 
to whichever organizations it 
chooses.
This is not an issue of freedom 
of association; this is a question
Its time for the University to announce that separate 
but equal is no longer acceptable, and create a policy 
that any new organization that moves into University 
housing must adhere to the Statement of Assurance.
is that fraternities respect the 
women who support them. Im 
sure Bowen and most frater
nity members believe this. Yet if 
the fraternities actually viewed 
women as their equals, then 
theyd open their doors to female 
membership.
Instead, Greek Life is predi
cated on a segregationist view 
of gender that boils down to the 
entirely unacceptable notion of 
separate but equal. The rest of 
society acknowledged a long time 
ago that separate but equal is 
not true equality and that closing
I am not opposed to organiza
tions that are founded on bonds 
based on race, gender, culture, 
sexual orientation, or just about 
anything you can think of. If a 
group of people can find strength 
and value in such an exclusion
ary organization, then so be it; 
I will never oppose the right of 
students to organize without 
interference. Student organiza
tions should not be bound by 
the Statement of Assurance, the 
University's policy not to discrim
inate against various groups.
Yet the University should not
of which organizations should 
be able to live in University 
housing.
No other student organiza
tions that have long-term leases 
with the University discriminate 
like Greek Life does. Its time for 
the University to announce that 
separate but equal is no longer 
acceptable, and create a policy 
that any new organization that 
moves into University housing 
must adhere to the Statement of 
Assurance.
And as far as the current gen
der segregationists go: You are
shooting yourselves in the foot. 
By keeping your doors closed to 
one gender, your organizations 
lose access to half of the brain
power and talent on this campus. 
I dont think the school should 
force you to integrate, but only 
because I dont think it would be 
effective.
Change must come from 
within, and its not easy. Yet in 
spite of Trent Lott (and thou
sands of others), Greek life was 
eventually integrated to some 
degree. Alpha Phi Omega has 
already shown that integration is 
possible  that one can be both 
Greek and coed.
So lets stop having this 
inane discussion about repre
sentations of Greek Life. You 
dont have to worry that people 
are watching Animal House.
If people suspect that fraterni
ties dont view women as their 
equals, its because fundamen
tally you dont. No amount of 
charity can change this fact. So 
stop the letters about Greeks 
not getting the credit theyre 
due. Open your doors; you 
have nothing to lose but your 
backwardness.
Mark Egerman (mde@J believes 
strongly in Gandhis statement 
You must be the change you wish 
to see in the world.  If you want a 
world of gender equality, you must 
practice what you preach.

The NBA: The only game in town
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
With the Super Bowl come and 
gone and the NHL season tee
tering on the brink of cancella
tion, sports fans only have one 
major outlet: basketball. Though 
the NBA lost a big part of its fan 
base due to the 1998 lockout, fans 
have been slowly coming back 
to the game thanks to the emer
gence of young stars. Heres a 
team-by-team look at the league 
at its midway point so far, start
ing this week with the Eastern 
Conference and continuing next 
week with the West.
Atlantic Division
The Atlantic is so bad right now 
that a .500 record could seal a 
divisional title, which would eas
ily be a record. On the plus side, 
with such awful standards, no 
team is bad enough to be consid
ered out of the playoff race. The 
New York Knicks, currently in last 
place, are only 6.5 games from 
the top.
Boston Celtics Despite incon
sistencies, the Celts have climbed 
to the top of the division and 
are the best bet to take the divi
sional crown. Paul Pierce has 
been his usual self, and the emer
gence of rookies Tony Allen and 
A1 Jefferson has given the team 
more depth than theyve had in 
the past few years. However, with 
Gary Payton likely to be traded, 
can the team stick together with
out an experienced point guard?
Philadelphia 76ers Allen 
Iverson is arguably playing the 
best basketball of his career, 
proving that he can play unself
ishly (7.6 assists per game). 
Unfortunately, one man can 
only do so much. Center Sam 
Dalembert hasnt come along 
like coaches had expected, and 
the team needs a second scoring 
option to get into the playoffs. It 
doesnt help that Glenn Robinson 
is eating up cap space sitting on 
the bench with knee problems.
New Jersey Nets Heres a quick 
quiz: Name the other three Nets 
starters besides Vince Carter and 
Jason Kidd. Richard Jefferson? 
Injured. Kenyon Martin? Gone. 
Instead, New Jersey starts Ron 
Mercer, Jason Collins, and Nenad 
Krstic, and back them up with 
household names like Billy 
Thomas and Jabari Smith. These 
guys need some depth, and fast.
Toronto Raptors Without 
Vince Carter around to take 20 
shots per game anymore, secondyear forward/center Chris Bosh 
is developing into what looks like 
a future all-star. However, Rafer 
Alston is reverting back to his 
selfish streetball days and Jalen 
Rose is falling apart faster than 
Ashlee Simpsons career. Look for 
them to make another big trade 
by the trading deadline.
New York Knicks General 
Manager Isiah Thomas 
loves to spend money on 
mediocre players. Penny 
Hardaway, Tim Thomas, Vin 
Baker, Jamal Crawford, and Allan 
Houston are all grossly over
paid and are keeping the Knicks 
from acquiring the young talent 
that could make them a winning 
team. On the bright side, Stephon 
Marbury and Nazr Mohammed 
are having big years.
Central Division
With the emergence of the 
Cavaliers and Bulls, the Central is 
the strongest division in the East. 
Traditional powerhouses Detroit 
and Indiana havent been play
ing at their usual levels, but have 
valuable playoff experience that 
the younger teams lack. Four out 
of the five teams in the Central 
could qualify for the playoffs in 
2005.
Detroit Pistons The defending 
champion Pistons have brought 
back all of their starters and have 
taken the lead in the Central 
after a slow start. Its more of the 
same in Detroit, as Rip Hamilton 
is scoring, Ben Wallace is pull
ing down rebounds and block
ing shots, and Darko Milicic isnt 
getting off the bench. However, 
with the Miami Heat now start
ing Shaquille ONeal, the Pistons 
time at the top of the East might 
be coming to an end.
Cleveland Cavaliers What a 
difference LeBron makes. The 
Cavs have gone from the laugh
ingstock of their division to con
tenders, all behind the play of 
a 20-year-old hybrid guard/for
ward. Hes turned former slug 
Zyndrunas Ilgauskas into a twotime All-Star and has made vet
eran point guard Jeff Mclnnis 
look good. This team will be 
strong for years to come, and 
the combination of LeBron and 
Brazilian Sideshow Bob lookalike 
Anderson Vareajo make this one 
of the most fun teams to watch.
Chicago Bulls Are the Baby 
Bulls finally coming of age? New 
coach Scott Skiles has trans
formed these perennial losers into 
a .500 team thanks to the play 
of young guys like Ben Gordon, 
Luol Deng, Tyson Chandler, and 
especially Kirk Hinrich. Eddy 
Curry could still develop into a 
solid center or pay off in a trade. 
These youngsters are in position 
to make the playoffs for the first 
time since Michael Jordan left.
Indiana Pacers Without Ron 
Artest, the Pacers have strug
gled, giving up lots of points to 
good offensive teams. In fact, the 
infamous brawl in Detroit left 
the Pacers without their three 
arguably best players for fifteen 
games. However, with Jermaine 
ONeal back and scoring like hes 
out for revenge (26.4 points per 
game), and key players like Jeff 
Foster taking on bigger roles, this 
team could easily go on a run and 
sneak into the playoffs.
Milwaukee Bucks Should 
they trade Michael Redd? That 
seems to be the biggest issue 
in Milwaukee right now, as the 
Bucks cant seem to get anything 
together this season. Redd has 
been the face of this franchise 
for the past few years (not that 
theres been any other choice), 
but he has to be getting frustrated 
with the lack of support from his 
teammates. Des Mason still hasnt
met his potential, and Keith Van 
Horn is notoriously soft. Maybe 
a package deal of Redd and Toni 
Kukoc to the Nuggets in exchange 
for Nene and Nikoloz Tskitishvili 
could help this team.
Southeast Division
The Miami Heat, with the 
addition of Shaq and the devel
opment of Dwyane Wade, have 
taken control of this division with 
the best record in the East. The 
surprising play of the Magic and 
the Wizards have them primed 
for playoff spots, while the Hawks 
and the expansion Bobcats are 
right where everyone predicted 
they would be: the bottom.
Miami Heat Bringing in Shaq 
alone would have made them 
division favorites, but with 
Dwyane Wade becoming the sec
ond best player from the 2003 
draft, theyre head and shoulders 
over the rest of the league. The 
only real concern here is depth, 
but that could be solved if they 
pick up Alonzo Mourning (and 
his kidney) off waivers this week.
Washington Wizards Starting 
three guys that all played 
together with the Golden State 
Warriors has produced a very unWarriorlike effect  the Wizards 
are actually winning! Antawn 
Jamison and Gilbert Arenas lead 
the team now that Larry Hughes is 
hurt, but when healthy the three 
averaged 66 points, 19 rebounds, 
and 13 assists combined. Sure, 
Kwame Brown is still awful, and 
they have no real center, but this 
is a serious contender.
Orlando Magic Grant Hill 
finally looks like Grant Hill again. 
Steve Francis lost his best buddy 
Cuttino Mobley, but hes playing 
through the heartbreak. Nineteenyear-old Dwight Howard is 
leading the team in rebounds. 
It seems like without Tracy 
McGrady, things are finally look
ing up for the Magic. If they con
tinue their consistent play theyll 
make the playoffs, rebounding 
from having the leagues worst 
record last year.
Charlotte Bobcats Did anyone 
expect them to win ten games this 
the whole season? Theyve already 
got ten before the All-Star break. 
GM Bernie Bickerstaff did a great 
job with the expansion draft, keep
ing payroll low and gambling on 
young guys with lots of potential. 
Theyll be big players in the free 
agent market this summer. If they 
can get a strong veteran to play 
alongside Emeka Okafor and 
assist machine Brevin Knight, this 
team could climb into the playoff 
race sooner than expected.
Atlanta Hawks Theyre not 
good, but help could be on the 
way. Antoine Walker is in the last 
year of his contract and will soon 
be gone, freeing up cap room to 
sign free agents this summer. 
Rookies Josh Childress and Josh 
Smith have both been playing 
well and will be building blocks 
for the future. They wont win 
anything for a while, but theres 
potential here.

Womens basketball falls to Brandeis
WOMENS, from A12
The Tartans started the sec
ond half by chipping away at 
the Judges lead. A jump shot by 
senior guard Lisa Seacat brought 
the game within two points. But 
the game would not remain this 
close. The Judges were able to 
play much better basketball in 
the second half, and the Tartans 
continued to hurt themselves on 
offense, committing turnovers 
and failing to hit open shots.
The Judges dominated the 
Tartans in the paint, scoring 30 
points to the Tartans 16. In addi
tion, the Judges scored 15 second-chance points to the Tartans 
four. The Tartans, however, outrebounded the Judges 34-32. 
Junior forward/center Melissa 
DeAngelo and first-year point 
guard Candice Gesecki both had 
a team-high six rebounds.
Throughout the game the 
Tartans were troubled by an incon
sistent and error-prone offense. 
The cause of much of their trou
bles was Brandeis tenacious 
pressing defense, which forced 
29 turnovers and 14 steals. 
The Judges were able to score 
27 points off of turnovers; the 
Tartans, meanwhile, managed
only a meager four.
The Tartan defense played well 
but was not able to amass the 
Judges numbers. Seacat led the 
Tartans with four steals, while 
DeAngelo blocked three shots and 
grabbed five defensive rebounds. 
The offense was led by Sain, who 
ended the game with 19 points
 nine from three-pointers
 and Seacat, who contributed 
18 points.
Our defense was our strength, 
said assistant coach Jamie Knotts. 
The offense is coming along but 
the team has been hurt by injuries 
and were still trying to fill the 
spots. In the game, the Tartans 
were able to force 18 turnovers 
and nine steals.
The game was filled with slop
py play by both squads. Perhaps 
the games only consistency 
was Allen, a short, stout, and 
somewhat disgruntled Brandeis 
fan wearing a blue Brandeis Tshirt with the words Im Allen 
screened on the back. Throughout 
the game Allen cheered for the 
defense to get their hands up and 
responded to every Brandeis bas
ket with a high-pitched Sweeet! 
Often making more noise than 
the Carnegie Mellon faithful, 
Allens consistency was welcome
in a game epitomized by errant 
passes and missed opportunities.
Ultimately the Tartans lost to 
the Judges by 15 points. While 
the 50-65 score was lopsided, the 
Tartans were able to stay within 
10 points of the Judges until the 
final minutes of the game.
We would like to get another 
win this season, said Knotts, We 
need to get over the hump and 
play the whole game, not just the 
first half. Our scores never really 
represent the way we play.
Last week, the womens team 
dropped home games to confer
ence rivals Case Western and 
Emory University. Against Case, 
the Tartans looked like they 
would snap their losing streak, 
but the Spartans pulled away to 
secure a 53-47 victory. Against 
Emory, Carnegie Mellon was held 
to a season-low 34 points.
The Tartans took on the New 
York University Violets at Skibo 
Gymnasium this Sunday. This 
week, they will travel to St. Louis 
and Chicago for UAA rematches 
against the University of Chicago 
and Washington University. 
Theyll have to look for their first 
division win on the road, as the 
women wont return to Skibo for 
the rest of the regular season.

14 February 2005THE TARTANAit?
Swim teams finish second, fourth at UAAs
by Erin Goldberger
Asst. Forum Editor
At the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) champion
ships this past week, both the 
men and women swimmers and 
divers proved successful with sec
ond and fourth place finishes, 
respectively.
During the first day of the 
meet, CMU finished the first of 
three finals competitions with 
the men in second place and the 
women in third place. In the 200 
freestyle relay, sophomore Jenny 
Sieger, senior Jessica Gibbons, 
and first-years Emily Tong and 
Lauren Connell set a school 
record with a time of 1:39.29. 
The men also had a strong 200 
freestyle relay with sophomore 
David Krzeminski, junior Evan 
Powell, first-year Michael Bailey, 
and senior Chris Pearson taking 
second with a time of 1:23.46.
This broke the school record 
and the former UAA record and 
made a national qualifying B 
cut thats fast enough to make 
the meet, according to coach Dr. 
David Belowich.
Also, in the 500 freestyle, firstyear Andy Douglass finished in 
fifth place, dropping almost six 
seconds from his personal best 
with a time of 4:43.88. Pearson 
took home first with a time of
4:30.54, a time that broke the 
pool record and made a national 
qualifying A cut time. Junior 
Brian Hunter won the 200 
individual medley with a time 
of 1:54.17, followed by Bailey, 
who placed ninth, and first-year

Mens basketball loses game in final seconds; slip to second in UAA standings
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
The Tartan mens basketball 
team dropped a heartbreaker 
to Brandeis University Friday 
in a University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) contest 73-72. With 
the loss, the Tartans fell to 14-5 
overall and 6-3 in the UAA as 
Brandeis moved to 12-9 and 
5-5.
Carnegie Mellon led for 
the first 5:17 of the game be
fore the Judges tied the score at 
10. Brandeis took the lead for 
good less than a minute later on 
Bryan Lamberts jumper with 
13:41 to play in the half. Behind 
strong defense and good outside 
shooting, the Judges built their 
lead up to 13 points before the 
Tartans would turn it around and 
cut the lead to three at 41-38 
heading into the half.
The second half was no 
different as Brandeis led by as 
many as nine and took a 72-67 
lead with 1:55 left in regulation. 
Tartans junior Clayton BarlowWilcox, who led the team in scor
ing, cleaned up a missed lay-up by 
junior Michael Divens and made 
the put back shot, cutting the 
Judges lead to three, 72-69 with 
just under a minute to play. After
a Judges turnover, junior Nate 
Maurer  who recently scored 
the 1000th point of his career 
against Case Western  nailed 
a three-pointer from the top of 
the arc with 30 seconds left to 
tie the score at 72-72. Brandeis 
held the ball, waiting for the 
last shot, and first-year Kwame 
Graves-Fulgham was fouled with 
two seconds left sending him to 
the line for two shots. His first 
shot fell short, but the second was 
good, giving the Judges a one 
point lead, 73-72. Brandeis took 
two time-outs to figure out how 
to stop the Tartans last effort, 
and the preparation worked. The 
Tartans desperation chance fell 
short as the throw-in pass was 
intercepted.
Four Carnegie Mellon start
ers finished the game scoring 
in double figures. Leading the 
way was Barlow-Wilcox, re
cording his sixth double-double 
on the year and finishing with 
career highs for the second 
straight game with 29 points and
15 rebounds. Barlow-Wil
cox shot 12 of 19 from the 
floor, increasing his .629 
shooting percentage that was 
second best in the UAA going 
into the weekend. Senior Michael 
Divens recorded his sixth double
double on the year as well as
finishing with 12 points and a 
career high 13 rebounds, Maurer 
had 15 points, and senior Jason 
Walters ended with 11 for the 
Tartans.
The Tartans had the edge on 
the glass, pulling in 45 rebounds 
as Brandeis had just 28. How
ever, Brandeis was able to force 
three more turnovers against 
the Tartans and shot 50.8 per
cent from the floor compared to 
Carnegie Mellons 42 percent. 
The Judges also had four players 
in double figures as Lamberts
19 points led the way. First-year 
Joe Coppens added 15, and 
Steve DeLuca chipped in with 14. 
Graves-Fulgham finished with
11.
Last week, the Tartans snapped 
a two game losing streak with 
back to back wins at home. On 
Friday, February 4, the Tartans 
held on to fend off Case Western 
Reserve University, 83-81, and 
last Sunday they avenged an ear
lier loss to Emory, running past 
the Eagles 95-84.
Against Case Western, the Tar
tans jumped out to a 42-33 first 
half lead, capitalizing on their 
strong outside shooting. The team 
hit half of their shots compared to 
just 41.2 percent for the Spartans. 
Junior Nate Maurer had 16 points 
and two steals at the half.
In the second period, the 
Tartans came out firing, 
increasing their lead to 13 points 
behind the shooting of Mau
rer. However, with 15 minutes 
to go, the Spartans began their 
comeback surge. Capitalizing 
on missed free throws by the 
Carnegie Mellon, Case West
ern crept back into the game, 
pulling within four points with 
seven minutes to play. Two free 
throws by Spartan sophomore 
forward Carson Oren gave Case 
their first lead since seven min
utes into the first half. The game 
was scoreless for nearly three 
minutes as Case led by a point 
until Nate Maurer hit a jumper to 
put the Tartans ahead for good 
with only a minute left. The Tar
tans hit all their free throws from 
that point on to seal the game for 
the home team.
Nate Maurer led the Tar
tans with 29 points, ten 
rebounds, and two blocks. 
Clayton Barlow-Wilcox added
16 points and eight rebounds.
It was a different story against 
Emory, as the Tartans held a 
slight lead at the half and pulled 
away in the second frame. Again, 
Carnegie Mellon used superior 
shooting to wear down their op
ponents, hitting shots at a 59.3 
percent rate in the first period,

Junior forward Nate Maurer pulls down a rebound over a Chicago player.
even though they missed all seven 
of their three-point attempts.
Emory took a one point lead a 
minute into the second half, but 
that was as close as they would 
come to victory. The Tartans 
pulled away and led by as many as 
14 as they closed out the Eagles, 
avenging an 85-88 loss in Atlanta 
three weeks ago. Junior Clayton 
Barlow-Wilcox led the team with
29 points and 15 rebounds. This 
performance earned him UAA 
Player of the Week honors. 
Senior guard Elliot Goren added
20 points, seven rebounds, and a 
game-high five steals.
Currently, Carnegie Mellon is 
in second place in the UAA, two 
games behind leader Rochester. 
They will finish the regular sea
son on the road.
Women lose tough game versus BrandeisIndoor track teams impress at Bucknell
by Kevin LaBuz

On Friday evening the Carnegie 
Mellon Tartans (4-16) faced off 
against the Brandeis University 
Judges (18-2). Brandeis entered 
the contest being recently 
ranked tenth in the nation by 
d3hoops.com for womens DIII basketball. In contrast, the 
Tartans were playing for 
little more than respect and their
elusive fifth win. Yet despite the 
glaring difference in record, the 
Tartans were not about to cede 
anything.
Brandeis took the lead 30 sec
onds into the game with a suc
cessful jump shot. The Tartans, 
however, recaptured the lead 
when sophomore guard 
Nora Darcher converted 
two free throws. On the 
following possession, Darcher hit 
a jumper to give the Tartans a 
42 lead, only to have the lead
lost two minutes later. Though 
the Tartans tied the game twice, 
they were never able to retake 
the lead.
The Judges played several 
defenses, often reverting to a 
full-court or half-court press. The 
press proved to be troublesome 
for the Tartans, who had 
difficulty throughout the game 
completing passes and mov
ing the ball fluidly. Brandeis 
was able to capitalize on the 
Tartans offensive shortcomings 
by scoring 13 points off of turn
overs in the first half.
The first half ended with 
the Tartans trailing the Judges 
by four points with a score of 
27-31. At halftime, senior guard 
Carissa Sain led the Tartans 
with 12 points and three assists. 
Brandeis was led by sophomore 
center Caitlin Malcolm, who had 
nine points and three rebounds, 
and by junior forward Christine 
Clancy, who had eight points
 all coming from free throws.

This Saturday the men and 
womens track teams competed 
at the Bucknell Winter Classic 
at Bucknell University in Central 
Pennsylvania. The meet began 
at 11am on Saturday, requiring 
the team to make the four hour 
drive on Friday evening and stay 
overnight to ensure getting to 
the meet on time the next morn
ing. It was a full day at the track 
from 11 to 6pm with approxi
mately 16 events and 20 schools 
altogether.
This meet was important 
for Carnegie Mellons track 
team because of the level of 
competition that was available. 
All colleges present were divided 
into division one, two, or three 
schools by the NCAA according 
to school size or athletic facili
ties and reputation. D-I schools 
generally have the strongest 
athletes because these schools 
are bigger, allowing for a more 
diverse group of people to come
to the school. These D-I schools 
often have more scholarships to 
offer to outstanding athletes.
Though Carnegie Mellon is 
a DIII school, the diversity of 
this meet allowed the team to 
compete against several D-I and 
D-II schools such as Syracuse 
University and Bucknell. Overall, 
most of the CMUs track team 
felt satisfied with how the meet 
went. There were PRs (personal 
records) all over the place. It was 
a good time, said junior 3000 
meter racer Carrie Mallozzi. The 
mens team had top five finishers 
in the 500, mile 1000, 5000, and 
4x400, and the women placed 
top five in the 800, and the 3000. 
Graduate student Nik Bonaddio, 
who ran and won the 500 in 1:07, 
then continued to run on the 
4x400 relay team and allowed 
them to place 2nd overall despite 
thick competition. Bonaddio took 
a much needed break in between 
races. I always feel much better 
after I throw up, said Bonaddio. 
Junior Dana Irrer also had a 
strong race day placing first in the 
mile with a time of 4:21, and took
home a second place finish in the 
1000 with a time of 2:37.
Unlike the outdoor 400-meter 
track, indoor tracks are only 
200 meters around. This leads 
to sharp turns that cause an ath
letes time to be slower than on an 
outdoor track. The runners were 
satisfied with Bucknells track. 
The track was wider which made 
everything more visible, so it felt 
fast. There was also a lot of good 
competition, said first-year Kiley 
Williams who ran on the 4x400 
team that placed second overall.
Up until now, Carnegie Mellon 
has not had a chance to compete 
with this many teams. The other 
two meets prior to this week
end only had 5 to 7 teams. This 
was a pretty big jump from last 
weeks meets. There was a lot of 
shouldering. I went out pretty 
fast, but once I hit the 800 I felt 
pretty good, said Drew Miller, a 
first-year mile runner.
Despite the tough competi
tion, several other Tartan athletes 
had strong performances. Junior

The Johnson Brothers Band
Local band disappoints Pittsburgh listeners
I had high hopes before I listened to Launch, because 
the Johnson Brothers Band is a local band, and they 
recorded this album across the 
river at Mr. Smalls. Always 
one to support the scene, I 
enthusiastically popped it in 
and started listening. I kept 
thinking it would get bet
ter, that maybe the first few 
songs werent the best ones, 
that maybe they had to grow 
on me. Sadly, nothing grew.
Thats not to say that this is 
a horrible album, but rather 
one that isnt special in any 
way.
Paul Lundblads voice grows 
old and annoying after a 
while, and while the Johnson 
Brothers Band claims to be 
rock n roll in a raw, power
ful, exciting form, they dont 
always pull that off. Some 
songs are a bit more rockin 
than others, but even prom
ising songs have awful cho
ruses or unsatisfying lyrics (cause I dont deserve the 
hurt/you treat me like dirt/you cut me down til theres 
nothing left). There are a few sweet guitar solos, true 
to the rock n roll aim of this band. My first reaction 
was to compare them with bands like The Mooney
Suzuki, but by comparison, the Johnson Brothers Band 
doesnt do much for me.
The first track, One Second 
Plenty, should be enough indica
tion of what the rest of the songs 
sound like, but its also one of the 
better songs on the album. Let me 
clarify, actually: It doesnt make 
me cringe as much as some of the 
other songs. Hangmans Cornin 
starts off with soft guitar strum
ming and Lundblads lone voice. 
Its a nice change from the other 
tracks, slowly adding in some 
drums and other sounds. Its a 
softer song, and one of the more 
successful ones.
These are local kids, enjoying 
what they do, and they have a 
firm belief in their goal and their 
outlook on music. They seem to 
have a good local following, and 
recording at Mr. Smalls is a good 
step for them. Maybe subsequent 
efforts will produce more promis
ing results. Ill keep my fingers crossed for them, but 
Im still not holding my breath.

Citizen Cope
Emotional lyrics deliver powerful messages
The Clarence Greenwood Recordings is Citizen Copes 
debut album on RCA. The record is aptly named, as 
Citizen Copes real name is Clarence Greenwood, and 
this album marks a new level for Greenwood as a song
writer. The core of this album is the stories Greenwood 
tells on each song; my favorite is Pablo Picasso, 
about a man in love with a painting on a wall. The 
stories in each ballad are from the characters point of 
view, offering an emotional perspective, rather than 
straightforward storytelling.
If you havent heard Citizen Cope before, there are two 
things that will initially hit you upon listening. First, 
Greenwoods voice is incredibly unique. Its slightly 
rugged, slightly whiny at times, but very effective, and 
an important element in the experience of listening 
to his music. Second, the lyrics are both beautiful and 
sharp. The chorus on Sideways sings to the lingering 
of emotions (and Im telling you/these feelings wont 
go away/theyve been knockin me sideways/theyve 
been knockin me out lately). Lyrics on Penitentiary 
are equally well written (well Im waiting on a time/ 
when the people walk free to see/from the peniten
tiary in our mind/when theres no need to bleed). The
combination of these two make for an intense musical 
experience.
Unfortunately, a few songs are musically weak, but its 
not enough to take away from Greenwoods singing or 
the overall mood and feel of this album. Hurricane 
Waters starts off sounding a bit too much like the jazz 
background music in dressing rooms or in hotel lob
bies. It isnt terrible, but enough to make me want to 
skip to the next song. Some songs are a better mesh of 
lyrics, singing style, and music than others. Elements 
of blues, jazz, and hip-hop can all be found on these 
tracks. Initially I pegged this album as something I 
wouldnt normally listen to, but after a few songs, an 
awareness of the beauty of what Greenwood is doing 
becomes apparent. The album starts off strong, and 
after very slight lagging near the end, it ends with a 
really nice instrumental song, Deep. His storytelling 
is emotional and smooth, leaving a lot to interpretation 
and adaptation.

The electrical engineering department received a $10,000 grant from the L.H Terpening Company of New York to perform research on analog computers. Mr. Terpening, 
the owner of the Company, was a Carnegie Tech alumnus, and his gift was the first of 
its kind from a private company to fund research on analog computers.

February 12,1980
A large crowd attended a Student Senate meeting demanding that Senate pass a reso
lution opposing Selective Service registration. Senate voted down the resolution for 
the second time in less than a year because many Senators felt that such action would 
not be appropriate until Congress had taken action.

Student Body President Declan McCullagh came under further scrutiny for financial 
activity in his account. A petition was signed by 350 students demanding McCullagh be 
impeached. Among the various charges against McCullagh was that he had obtained 
an American Express Corporate Card without Carnegie Mellons permission.

land. The professor moved into a hotel room.

Caf Asia Combines Quick Service and Style
Quaint eatery serves up an array of ornate dishes
Caf Asia
5883 Forbes Avenue 
412-521-2080
With an inconspicuous storefront on Forbes Ave, Caf 
Asia doesnt look very remarkable. Even its name is 
nondescript, and one would expect the usual boring panAsian food to appear on the menu. Pittsburgh has its fair 
share of Thai and Chinese restaurants already, and we 
all know the perils of dining at Asiana in Newell-Simon. 
But Caf Asias menu will surprise Asian food lovers; it 
has a small but unique selection of Thai, Vietnamese, 
and Japanese dishes that are difficult to find elsewhere 
in Pittsburgh.
Instead of taking the approach of many Asian restaurants 
of having hundreds of menu options, Caf Asia has a 
selective menu of a few choice dishes. Food such as betel 
nut leaves as an appetizer just arent found anywhere else. 
Betel nut leaves, for those who have had them, are like 
the chewing gum of Asia. People of all ages throughout 
the day wrap shredded coconut, lime, and a number of 
savory ingredients in a leaf of the betel plant and chew 
the leaf packet as a stimulant, breath freshener, or in this 
case, an appetizer. Its a dish worth trying but a bit exotic 
for American tastes.
There is a good selection of appetizers, including soups 
and salads. Thai and Vietnamese salads are a bit too tangy
for my taste with all of their lime juice and chili, so I went 
for the tom ka soup and the vegetarian potstickers. Tom 
ka soup is a variant on the popular tom yum Thai soup; 
while tom yum has a signature hot-and-sour taste (as it 
contains lemongrass and chunks of ginger as its base), 
tom ka takes away a little of the sourness and spiciness 
with the addition of coconut milk. The soup was not 
too spicy or too thick, and flecks of mushrooms added 
more flavor. Remember to beware floating pieces of 
lemongrass, though: you probably shouldnt eat those.
The potstickers were fried instead of steamed, and filled 
with a mushy vegetable mixture. Most of the flavor 
came from the sesame oil-enhanced dipping sauce and 
the fried shell. For a main course I tried the Vietnamese 
crispy crepe, a large thick pancake made with egg and 
flour and then fried. It was filled with bean sprouts, 
mushrooms, and cooked shrimp, and topped with fresh 
lettuce and a light sauce. The sauce moistened the fried 
crepe, making it easier to eat, and the lettuce provided a 
contrast to the other cooked ingredients. The crepe was 
good, filling Vietnamese comfort food and the first of its 
kind I have seen in Pittsburgh.
My companion chose the green curry, which was a fairly 
standard mix of vegetables cooked in coconut milk and 
chili-coriander-based green curry paste. The curry did 
have a lot of overpowering basil leaves, though, which 
took the emphasis away from the other flavors. Caf
Asia (being a caf) has fairly quick service  something 
that is very handy for people in a hurry. It is also great 
because they have unusual taste in music; but if you 
enjoy listening to the soundtrack of Phantom of the 
Opera, your wait might be a little unpleasant. There 
are also a number of hearty noodle soups on the menu, 
some of them Japanese. Most of Caf Asias dishes are 
very filling and it seems like a good place to fuel up on a 
cold winter day. Ive also noticed that the low prices and 
convenient location make it a popular spot on Friday and 
Saturday nights, so plan accordingly.
For dessert, I decided to go for the classic sticky rice and 
mango. The sticky rice, cooked in coconut milk, was 
mild and not overpoweringly sweet like the kind you find 
many places. The juicy fresh mango complemented the 
rice well.
Service is quick, the food is moderately priced (an 
entree will run you around $10), and the menu is 
designed around slightly unusual but filling dishes. Caf 
Asia shows that another Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh 
doesnt hurt, especially when they take something good 
and make it better.

Cherry Monroe
Even a cherry on top cant improve this Vanilla Ice in emos clothing
New Wave? Check. Grunge? Check. Boy bands? Check. 
Yup, youve been there, youve done that, and youve now 
officially moved on. So whats on the charts now? The 
often heart-wrenching, tear-jerking and anger-inducing 
offspring of the punk era, the emo-pop-rock genre. 
Before you dive head-first into the next music era, 
though, the last couple of late bloomers need to squeeze 
their way into the publics eye and hop onto the scene. In 
Cherry Monroes case, though, maybe bloomers is the 
wrong word to use. Despite their growth in size, theres 
no blooming going on.
Cherry Monroes five members each hail from the greater 
Pittsburgh area. They began as a smaller band, the Velvet 
Idols, which included guitarist Ryan Harris, drummer 
Jason Levis, and bassist David Saltzman. Lead singer 
and guitarist Matt Toka quickly joined the ranks after a 
two-day jam session in which the four discovered they 
melded well together. In trying to obtain the sound they 
wanted, the group made the final addition of guitarist 
Frankie Bennett. What is now Cherry Monroe was finally 
complete in members, but in desperate need of a new 
name.
The bands focus on image and business before musical 
quality is obvious. Their CDs booklet portrays the band
wearing the standard rock-n-roll-meets-emo getup. 
Cherry Monroe specifically features studded belts, black 
eyeliner, and overly-gelled hair with a cigarette and dress 
tie thrown in for good measure.
A formula, or a rule, is meant to be broken; risks should 
be taken. But Cherry Monroe doesnt take a single risk in 
their entire self-titled album. Why are they unoriginal? 
Why will listeners be so apathetic? Because everyone has 
heard it all before  quite literally. While its perfectly 
acceptable to draw influence from other bands, it is 
completely unacceptable to use their words. They claim 
that The Cure and Bob Dylan are their lyrical influences, 
but once again I think these musicians would be far 
from honored. Besides, there are other more obvious 
influences than The Cure and Bob Dylan.
Betcha thought I cant get no satisfaction was a famous 
line  or, hey, an entire song  created by the Rolling 
Stones. And you probably also thought tattoos of 
memories was a line from the punk rock group Green 
Days hit Good Riddance. Well, youre right. Those lines 
were once credited to their rightful artists. Now, Cherry 
Monroe has plucked those lines straight from lyrics.com 
and inserted them inappropriately into their songs.
Besides blatantly copying lyrics, Cherry Monroe is pulling 
off something reminiscent of Vanilla Ices 1990 heist 
of Queens Pressure. The band lists Switchfoot and 
Dashboard Confessional among their musical influences, 
but the audience might (again) hear differently. The 
first track on the CD, Gone, is reminiscent of Ocean 
Avenue by Yellowcard. Down may remind you of 
Down With the Sickness by Disturbed, and their single 
Satellites will remind you of Maps by the Yeah Yeah 
Yeahs, with a little bit of the folk-like, Scottish-influenced 
group Seven Nations mixed in.
If Cherry Monroe wants to match the lyrical greatness 
of The Cure and Bob Dylan, lines like, ... Im ... /outside 
your house drunk and/screaming at the stars are far 
from helping them achieve serious status as rock stars. 
Granted their tunes are ever-so-slightly catchy, but thats 
due to cloning the sounds of other popular bands. Cherry 
Monroe really only succeeds at two things: looking the 
part of the emo band and being excellent Vanilla Ice 
proteges.

Mommy and Daddy
Band combines drums, bass, and high fashion to wow the audience
Do you like drum loops? Sexy screaming? Shakin 
everything youve got? Of course you do. So do Edmond 
Hallas and Vivian Sarratt, the duo that make up the New 
York band Mommy and Daddy. After previous attempts 
at songwriting as a pair resulted in music that was too 
depressing for their liking, their current sound is much 
more danceable and reflects a feel-good attitude towards 
life.
Mommy and Daddy mix up a drum machine, the sounds 
of the synth, a bass guitar, and alternating vocals to make 
their music. The result, if you havent already heard it, 
is a full-on dance party. When Ed plays the drums and 
sings, Vivian plays bass, and they switch it up again when 
she sings. They are a foxy pair, too. Both are fashionably 
dressed and will probably inspire more side-parts and 
tighter-fitting clothes among the indie elite.
Their songs are catchy from the get-go, inducing some 
hip-shaking or, at the very least, toe-tapping. Maybe I
just have a soft spot in my heart for drum machines, but 
its more likely that Mommy and Daddy simply do a good 
job at making awesome music. Theres nothing overly 
impressive about their songs, other than the fact that 
they use simple instruments to make their dancy, dirty, 
synth-pop sound. In fact, the simplicity of their music is 
most of the appeal, making it more about dancing and 
having a good time than using too many guitar pedals 
and technical perfection.
They already have a decent discography to boot, including 
a few EPs, appearances on compilation CDs, and a full 
length in 2003, Live How You Listen. If you absolutely 
need some sort of comparable references, their sound 
has been compared to Le Tigre, Devo, the Misfits, and the 
B-52s. But better than listing bands they sound like, go 
to their website and listen to songs from their upcoming 
EP Fighting Style Killer Panda. Their website also has 
almost everything you need or want to know about the 
band. Photos of them having fun and looking good, tour
dates, a complete discography, links to things they find 
important, a pop-up player, and a blog-style update page 
can all be found at www.mommyanddaddy.com.
They are signed to London record label Big Cat Records, 
and have toured in the UK for four full weeks. The duo 
have recently confirmed their upcoming tour, starting 
with a show right here in Pittsburgh. They will be playing 
at the Mr. Roboto Project in Wilkinsburg on Tuesday, 
February 15, with The Static Age and Eyes Like Knives. 
After touring most of the rest of the U.S., the/ll return 
for another Pittsburgh show at Modern Formations on 
April 13 with Chariots A.N. and Call Me Lightning. If 
you dont frequent the Roboto Project, they are a must if 
you want to gain exposure to the Pittsburgh music scene. 
Directions and upcoming shows can be found on their 
website, www. therobotoproject. org.

Sex Week 2005: What to expect
This years sex-related events feature traditional treats and new activities
Every two years, the Carnegie Mellon Womens Center 
pairs with other campus organizations to bring a week 
of sex. Well, all right, not exactly. Sex Week, sponsored 
by the Womens Center, is a combination of events that 
include both educational events (such as this years Sex 101) and entertainment, such as a performance by 
singer/songwriter Mirah at the Underground. To some, 
the events at Sex Week will make even the undaunted 
blush; but dont fear, there are events that are slightly 
milder in tone for the faint of heart.
Both the squeamish and the interested should know what 
to expect. Jairan Sandeghi, a Womens Center member 
and actor in The Vagina Monologues, gave insight into 
how this years Sex Week has shaped up and what will 
be featured at some of the events. Sandeghi, a senior 
BHA student, has only been involved with one Sex Week 
before, but she has had an inside perspective on the con
tent of this years show. Were definitely trying to mix it 
up she said, noting that this year the Womens Center
is holding events with ALLIES. Whereas previous years 
have had a stronger GLBT flavor, 2005s Sex Week does 
not have a strong slant one way or another, according to 
Sandeghi. In addition to events held in conjunction with 
Allies, Sandeghi said that ...this year the The Vagina 
Monologues has become more a part of the week. In pre
vious years, the production was not performed as a part 
of the events of Sex Week.
Sex Week kicked off this past weekend with The Vagina 
Monologues (see page 7), but next week many other 
events will be held. A recurring event has been selling 
Condomgrams"  which include obvious helpful 
items - but also candy, which has been suggested in past 
years. This year, however, recipients will find only Hershe/s Kisses inside. The bags will also come with small 
suggestions on sex, said Sandeghi, including which lube 
to use with what. Though Condomgrams could only 
be purchased last Friday, if you are desperate to get one 
there are usually leftovers. Unfortunately, a lot of people 
dont come up to get them, explained Sandeghi.
The first event of this week happens tonight at McConomy where Real Women Have Curves will be showing. 
Savina Imrhan, a sophomore computer science major, 
was the Womens Center member in charge of bring
ing the film to campus. Imrhan spoke about the choice 
of film: The first priority was definitely relevance and 
we ... tried to find any specific movies that portrayed 
romance and or sex. We wanted to see something that 
people would want to go to and nothing too serious. We 
wanted to show a positive gender relationship. Imrhan 
added that the Womens Center also contacted teachers 
of film courses to get insight into which film might be 
appropriate.
Sex Week events get a touch more racy from there. 
Though the phrase Sex 101 may seem relatively benign, 
if anyone has seen Anita Barkins talks during Orienta
tion Week they may feel a bit differently. Sandeghi took 
on the coordination of this event, which will take place 
on Thursday. Barkin was left to decide the content of the 
workshop.
My talk focuses on human sexual response, wrote Barkin in an e-mail. I discuss human anatomy and physiology, psychological and emotional response, and safer sex 
practices. I also touch on the characteristics of a relation
ship that contributes to satisfying sexual response (i.e. 
ability to discuss issues openly and mutual respect).
Also on Tuesday is a Sex Toy Workshop featuring several 
employees of the Pittsburgh-based company Girls Night
In. In addition to the workshop on sex toys there will be 
some raffles for books on sex and sexuality as well as for 
sex toys at every event. The raffles are kept optional for 
those who attend the events, so dont be skittish about 
walking up to accept a prize.
The aforementioned ALLIES event will take place at 
the Womens Center on Thursday following Sex Talk, 
which merely encourages open discussion about sex 
between members of the community and the Womens 
Center. Allies is sponsoring screenings of The L Word 
as well: an HBO television show launched in 2004 which 
traces the lives of several lesbians who make their living 
in the Los Angeles area.
A final new addition to Sex Week is a concert by the mu
sical artist Mirah, who will be performing at the Under
ground on Wednesday.
It would be challenging to discuss Sex Week without 
acknowledging the possibility of controversy. Events 
such as Sex 101 and Sex Toy Workshop may seem in
appropriate to members of the community. Sandeghi 
described these workshops as really intimate, but not 
off-putting. She added that the goal of the Womens 
Center is to provide the time and the space for these 
events. Recently there have been several postings on 
misc.market discussing the content of Sex Week. Some 
have suggested that events were vulgar or a poor use of 
the Student Activities fee. It will be left to those who at
tend and respond to form their own opinions. However, 
if members of the community wish to know what the 
Womens Center hopes to provide through these events, 
then perhaps Imrhan can provide insight: I think that 
one of the primary goals of Sex Week is to have fun, but 
its also about educating the campus ... to be open about 
sex, sexuality, and gender. I hope that people learn to be 
a little more comfortable with sex and sexuality.... [We 
hope] that they gain awareness about things that other
wise might not be openly discussed.

Embracing the intimate
The Vagina Monologues incorporate music and art for a new flair
As part of the kick-off to Sex Week, The Vagina Mono
logues was produced using the front of McConomy 
Auditorium. This years production of Eve Enslers col
lected stories was co-directed by senior English majors 
Jessamyn Ansary and Jane Ratmansky, and was per
formed on Friday and Saturday nights.
Both Ansary and Ratmansky were happy to speak about 
their experience as directors for The Vagina Mono
logues. Both noted the talent of the cast and the benefit 
of the experience of directing. Ansary and Ratmansky 
have been involved in previous productions as directors 
or actresses, which in part they say has formed their 
love of the show. Ive been drawn to the show since I 
saw a production of it my freshman year, wrote Ansary 
via e-mail, and after participating in it my sophomore 
year, I knew I wanted to direct it.
This years production featured some new elements, 
including the introduction of art pieces from students 
in the College of Fine Arts. Said Ansary of this deci
sion, I projected art from CFA students behind each of 
the monologues because of the aesthetic value the art 
would provide, and also as a way of better involving the 
whole community in the production. All of the actors 
were students as well.
The monologues began with an introduction explain
ing briefly how they are each the true stories of women 
interviewed by Eve Ensler about their vaginas. This 
part features the entire cast in addition to a special 
appearance by Nicholas Guidry, a senior drama stu
dent who is coincidentally the only male in the entire 
production.
Each piece opened with a spotlight on the speaker. 
Often another cast member would introduce the piece 
before the monologue began. Each piece feature a dif
ferent song as introduction, and the monologue pieces 
were broken up by various skits that involved the audi
ence and vagina facts. The audience response por
tions included such blush-worthy questions as What 
does your vagina like to wear? to which the crowd 
offered possible responses such as a pink bra.
The monologues themselves are both hilarious and 
heartbreaking. They address topics as broad as rape 
and birth, all in the span of an hour and a half. Among 
the most noteworthy was The Flood, performed by 
Laura Gross.
The monologue addresses the sexual repression of one 
elderly woman who never got over her first embarrass
ing experience with an orgasm. Gross managed the 
humor of the piece beautifully, complete with a JewishAmerican accent, and her voices cadence immediately 
allowed the audience to hear when the woman was 
embarrassed or delighted. Her wide hand gestures 
encompassed all the excitement of someone who had 
never revealed her inner self before.
Other stunning performances were My Angry Vagina 
and My Vagina Was My Village, enacted by Suhana 
De Leon and Faryal Khan respectively. The two pieces 
capture the diversity of the content of the monologues 
entirely. De Leons wild, Hispanic-accented tones cry 
out against oppression and injustice to her vagina. She 
boldly suggests making comfortable underwear with 
French ticklers built in so that women are happy all 
day long. De Leons attitude was dynamic, her tones 
perfect for the expression of anger and subtly changed 
when she incorporated many humorous gestures. Her 
furious skirt-smoothing at the finale seemed a perfect 
fit for the content which at this point in the monologue 
has changed to an expression of hope for her vaginas 
needs.
In direct contrast with De Leons loud, burlesque style 
was Khans quiet, passionate speech. My Vagina Was 
My Village is a piece about a woman in Bosnia who 
was raped by soldiers. Aside from the moving content 
of the piece, Khan wove the poetic framework of the 
monologue well, her voice held anger but a suppressed 
anger held back by fear. Khan hardly moved during the 
monologue but her emphasis made her performance as 
passionate as any of the others.
Though occasionally the pieces seemed a bit rushed, 
all were performed with competent style and flavor. 
The actors wore very subtle costuming that fit with 
their speeches without overwhelming the speech itself. 
Despite the blunt commentary in The Vagina Monologues 
the monologue performers did not demean the content 
or the purpose of their pieces. The introductions were 
quieter and sometimes lost to the applause of the previ
ous piece, but they contained necessary notes that were 
helpful for placing context into the monologues. With 
only a few minor drawbacks this years monologues 
were completed nicely with eye-catching art, ear-catch
ing music, and skillful performance throughout.

Chasing Amy
ftI[uIs[od8 AIk SL G Sv ou[ SHP
Ben Affleck has been in one  only one  good movie. And this is it. In 
Kevin Smiths third major film, following the modem classic Clerks and the 
more mainstream Mallrats, Affleck plays a comic book artist who unfortu
nately falls for a lesbian. While not as straight-up laughable as other Kevin 
Smith movies, Chasing Amy is great and surprisingly poignant. And if you 
liked Mallrats or Dogma, never fear; Jason Lee is the other main character 
in this movie and has a cynical wackiness that plays off of Afflecks whiny 
stoicism for great results.
Dracula: Pages from a Virgins Diary
fx0m1s[od8 AIk SY G R8Sv8 ou[ SHj
For everybody who didnt get to see the Dracula ballet here in Pittsburgh 
this past fall, AB Thursday Films is bringing you the next best thing. 
Dracula: Pages from a Virgins Diary is a filmed ballet telling the story of the 
legendary vampire. Its seriously old-school, with a largely black-and-white 
palette and not a word of spoken dialogue. It should be suitably weird for 
everyone!
Napoleon Dynamite
fA1_[od8 AIk SR G R8Sv8 ou[ SHj
Its no surprise that a movie about a socially awkward, lanky mouthbreather 
who prides himself on his bo-staff skills would be a hit here at CMU. It was 
slightly less expected, though, that this movie would rekindle a wave of peo
ple saying gosh and heck yeah. The whole world has gone topsy-turvy, 
and now the kind of guy who used to get beat up after school is telling the 
most powerful country in the world whats cool and hip. This is indeed a 
disturbing universe.
Friday Night Lights

Football movies are always fun, and a lot of people have been saying this is 
one of the best to come out in recent years. On Saturday night you can find 
out for yourself  it sure beats lamenting the fact that the Steelers lost the 
championship, or that the Eagles lost the Super Bowl, or that Tom Brady stole 
your lunch money. If worst comes to worst, you can just pretend the team 
in the movie is the Steelers  the team always wins the big game in sports 
movies, so youll have nothing to worry about.

Alas, the days of the ridiculously indulgent and self-important rock opera are

One of this movies mottos is The erotic, exotic electrifying rock fantasy. 
Not only that, but it stars Roger Daltreyyes, that Roger Daltrey. The Whos 
guitarist plays 19th-century composer Franz Liszt in his escapades across 
infidelity and monasticism. And for the love of all that is righteous and awe
some, Ringo Starr plays the Pope!

Ninth annual Lunar Gala is well received
Time theme brings out creative costumes and designs
The venue: Wiegand Gymnasium. The event: Showdown 
between Carnegie Mellon and Paris. Weapon of choice: 
Fashion.
Lunar Gala, an annual student-run fashion show, brought 
crowds of students out of their rooms on Saturday night 
and into the UC, where long lines snaked around the walls 
of the building. The show, titled Time and co-produced 
by seniors Engly Chang and Michelle Kim, presented the 
fashion designs of 19 students. In production for its ninth 
year, this years theme was based on joining the present 
with past traditions, says Chang, who has been involved 
with Lunar Gala since her freshman year. The theme en
couraged designers to draw on their inspiration from the 
past and present and move forward to the future.
One of the most exciting aspects of the production was 
the use of props and accessories. From the usual tiaras 
and rhinestones to the more inspired onions and wing
like appendages, this years models strutted down the 
runway with fashion and flair. The lighting and sound 
system were in check, and despite a brief technical 
issue and a few minor modeling glitches, the produc
tion showed marked improvement from last year. Some 
common student remarks seemed to be that there was an 
improvement with the AV equipment, leading to better
transitions between sets, and that the models seemed to 
emanate more energy. In past years Lunar Gala also used 
announcers, but wiser heads prevailed and cut them out 
of this years program. This change sped up pacing and 
made the show more entertaining overall.
The fashion lines displayed on the runway ranged from 
the creative spins on the classic styles to the more innova
tive incorporation of different textures and props. Play 
it Up, the fashion line by designers Shabnam Ghaffari 
and Kathryn Tanis, featured an unconventional blend of 
childhood toys and memories in the most unusual places. 
The colorful and lively play of neckties and bowties, tutus 
and suspenders, a neon yellow hoop dress, and a thongrevealing gold miniskirt was a mix of bold, daring, and 
risque. A similar theme, Childlike Tendencies by Lesley 
Griffith and Alia Hassan, took a more playful stance with 
a princess dress with a hem of baby bibs, a Superman suit 
complete with a red cape, oversized dress shirts, costume 
jewelry, and overalls with cartoon celebrities.
Fallen, by Flora Bao and Stephen Mrdjenovich, sought 
a more dramatic effect by using masks, feathers, head
dresses, and extra appendages. The myth-like crea
tures that glided down the runway in their flowy outfits 
unmasked themselves as they made a second appearance
where they donned fitted dresses and skin-tight pants. 
The concept that the face we present may not be the self 
we are inside was clearly portrayed through the removal 
of the extra appendages, masks, and excessive layers of 
fabric.
Another creative line was Yerina Cha and Jeanne Parks 
Mono, which literally means things in Japanese. 
These unique outfits were a perfect blend of simplicity 
and creativity. While the models were fitted in the tra
ditional styles of elegance and chic-ness, their outfits 
were enhanced by wreaths of onions in addition to red, 
gold, and tan checkered trains. Classic black dresses were 
accentuated with the presence of simple colorful pat
terns, and frill trimmings further added to the overall ef
fect of the designs.
Finally, nature themes were a widely celebrated motif 
of the show. Stacey Chu and Winnifred Tses Life and 
Death depicted an entire life cycle starting from the 
carefree years of infanthood, to the mischievous teen
age years, and ending with the somberness of death. 
The progression of white fabric to a blend of black and 
white, and finally ending with entirely black, set a very 
definite mood, as the models walked down the runway 
with a definite attitude. Not to be outdone was The Be
ginning, which was ironically the last collection of the 
show. Based on the seven elements of the lunar calendar, 
designers Natisha Kang, Susie Lee, and Koo Ho Shin rep
resented the elements of the Earth using ruffles and pig
ments from nature.
Aside from the highly creative designs and the beauti
ful models, the dancers who performed hip-hop, breakdancing, popping, funk, and the traditional lion dance, 
along with Chinese chamber music, made the crowds go 
wild with cheering and applause. The only other incident 
during the night that brought about as much cheering 
was when the models came out scantily clad in lingerie 
from Victorias Secret. When the models strutted out on 
their runway, the audience exploded and threw roses 
upon the stage.
As the night drew to a close and the models, designers, 
helpers, and all who were involved came out and took 
their bows, speeches were made. Firecrackers were set 
off. Hugs were exchanged. Tears and confetti fell. Kim 
proclaimed, And, last but not least, Happy New Year. 
And a Happy New Year it was, as over four months of hard 
work and dedication came to a brilliant end.

Proving class is bad for your health
Stress, relationships, and status are considerations of common cold
With Carnegie Mellons stressful atmosphere and the cold 
season in full swing, Professor Sheldon Cohen conducted a 
lecture last Thursday to discuss the possible connections be
tween susceptibility to the common cold and specific psycho
logical factors. The emphasis was not only on the results of 
carefully controlled experiments, but also on the procedures 
followed in order to most effectively and accurately gather 
data. His lecture quantitatively explained the connections be
tween the cold and the stress behind it that had formerly been 
accepted, but not fully understood.
Cohen began his lecture with a lyric from the song Adelaides 
Lament from the Broadway musical Guys and Dolls. The 
song, about a girl with a cold caused by her broken heart, in
troduced the audience to exactly what he intended to explain, 
as well as set the mood of the lecture. His use of song lyrics 
and pictures continued throughout the lecture, enriching his 
detailed work with an occasional chortle from the crowd.
In the study, stress is characterized by external conditions ex
ceeding the bodys ability to cope. A cold is defined as the abil
ity of the virus to attack a host cell and replicate itself within 
that cell. The following experiments were heavily based on 
these two crucial definitions.
Cohen presented a number of experiments that all addressed 
different factors affecting susceptibility to colds. In the British 
Common Cold Study, researchers hoped to find out if stress 
induces a cold by affecting the immune system or by releas
ing hormones. The Pittsburgh Common Cold Study aimed 
to determine what kind of stressor  work, relationships, 
or miscellaneous reasons  most strongly coincided with 
colds. In these two studies, researchers relied on input from 
the test subjects concerning how much stress they perceived 
themselves to be going through. Both studies ensured that all 
the test subjects were healthy at the beginning of each experi
ment. The British test relied on questionnaires concerning 
the test subjects typical stress levels, as well as a physicians 
assessment of each test subject throughout the examination. 
The questionnaires asked questions concerning the test sub
jects exposure to stressful situations, as well as their own per
sonal assessments concerning their moodiness. The British 
study also included a close look at the number of viruses pres
ent and the number of antibodies present within a measured 
tissueful of mucus.
The Pittsburgh study only relied on this last objective piece of 
information, as well as nasal clearance. Subjects were inocu
lated with five different viruses for six days in each study and 
then observed in quarantine for another four to six weeks. 
The Pittsburgh study showed that work was the stressor most 
likely to cause colds, followed by relationship stress, then by 
other miscellaneous reasons. This study also showed that the 
longer the duration of a stressor, the more likely it was that a
cold would ensue. The British study predictably yielded re
sults that those under high stress were more likely to develop 
colds, and those with low stress were less likely to develop 
colds. It did not, however, isolate how stress affected the im
mune system or the release of hormones.
Researchers also studied how social integration would af
fect susceptibility to colds. This experiment asked subjects 
how many social roles (married, close friends, in a group, 
in a church) the participant felt himself a part of and an ac
tive member, and compared that to patients self-proclaimed 
levels of stress. This study showed that the more active roles a 
person has in society, the less likely he is to develop a cold.
This study leads right to another question: How does status 
in society affect susceptibility for catching a cold? This study 
was run on monkeys instead of people. Monkeys were put 
in either highor low-stress situations for 15 months. In this 
study, five monkeys were housed in each cage. The low-stress 
monkeys remained in one cage for the duration of the study, 
while the high-stress monkeys were rotated among cages 
every month. This way, among the low stress monkeys, domi
nance in cages was constant throughout the 15 months. In 
contrast, the high-stress monkeys were constantly reevaluat
ing their social structure. After inoculating them with viruses, 
technicians found that the low-ranking monkeys, in both the 
high and low stress situations, were more likely to develop the 
disease.
Cohen also mentioned that Childhood Socio-Economic Status 
(SES) had an effect on the likelihood of developing a cold. 
In this study, researchers hoped to find out if parents socio
economic status affected the likelihood that the child would 
develop colds in later years. The data from the experiment 
showed that the younger the child was when the parent didnt 
own a home, the greater the chance of developing a cold. Re
searchers then asked if the ill effects of early childhood SES 
could be undone by favorable adolescent SES. This was not 
the case. Even if the child had good SES in his adolescence, he 
would still be just as likely to get a cold as if he had poor SES 
as an adolescent.
Cohen then concluded by saying that there are still many 
things that we dont know about how stress affects the colds 
that we catch. We do know that income, involvement in the 
community, and the duration of stressors all affect our suscep
tibility to colds, but exactly how is still a mystery. Only more 
research and time will be able to clear it up. Upon questioning 
on the matter, Cohen smiled, Well, of course in five or six 
years we will know all the answers.

Rare opportunities disguised in rare books
Rare book collection includes classic first editions
The knowledge of humanity is stored in the air around us. 
At any moment, at any whim, we can digitally condense 
it, study it, and send it anywhere else on our planet at the 
speed of light. The age of tangibility is closing. It seems 
fitting, then, to look backward at the concrete centuries 
that have preceded this new one, and to nod to the ending 
era that was documented in and founded on one simple 
invention: the book.
Carnegie Mellon University is the proud home of an awe
inspiring collection of fine and rare books. Housed in 
the vault-like Fine and Rare Book Room in the middle of 
the fourth floor of Hunt Library, the collection features 
priceless pieces from classic literature, the evolution of 
science and religion, and select rarities from modern 
bookmaking. The collection started when Rachel Hunt, 
one of the people for whom the library is named, donated 
her personal library of valuable books in 1963. Since that 
time, many famous collectors have followed her tradition 
and made donations to Carnegie Mellon. At only 10,000 
volumes, the CMU collection is modest in comparison to 
the collections of other prominent universities. According 
to Mary Catherine Johnsen, the Special Collections 
Librarian and the collection's curator, it is no longer a 
fast-growing collection  were really going more for 
quality than quantity.
Quality5 is an understatement. Represented in the 
collection are the works of some of modern civilizations 
greatest celebrities: William Shakespeare, Benjamin 
Franklin, Charles Dickens, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam 
Smith, James Joyce, T.H. White, and T.E. Lawrence, to 
name an impressive few.
The books maintenance and care are the librarys utmost 
priority gum-chewing and flash photography are grave 
sins. They stand uniformly on shelves that line the room 
on all sides and are protected by panes of locked glass. The 
climate conditions are scrupulously controlled as well; 
the books are kept between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit 
and between 45 and 50 percent relative humidity. These 
conditions are necessitated by the various media of which 
books are made. Th paper, leather, cardboard, glue, 
and wood that compose the books expand and contract 
at different rates in different climates, and fluctuating 
conditions greatly increase the pace at which these books 
will, because of their great age, literally fall apart.
However, by no means should the collection be considered 
inaccessible. Johnsen encourages professors to bring 
their classes to see the collection. The purpose of a 
rare book collection is to honor the memory and work 
of people from 500 years ago, to serve current students 
and scholars, and to preserve books for people 500 years
from now.... There are five to 20 classes per semester 
[in the Fine and Rare Book Room], and it would really 
be wonderful if we could have five classes per week. Itd 
be wonderful if the University appreciated the fact that 
these are their books.
Johnsen, who has a background in art history, 
communications, library science, and public policy, has 
been Special Collections Librarian since 1982. She is also 
the liaison librarian for the School of Design. What I like 
to do best is tell stories about the books, Johnsen said. 
I like to keep; I like to share. Another manage of the 
collection is Evangeline Levis, library specialist for the 
Fine and Rare Book Room and the new Posner Center. 
Levis is also a calligrapher, a binder, and a teacher of 
these bookmaking arts.
Rebecca May, a graduate student in Literary and Cultural 
Studiess a teacher of literature, is enchanted by the 
collection. These things are time machines, she said. 
Theyre things that you will most likely not be able to see 
again in your life  let alone hold and rifle through and 
smell.... it makes one aware of the labor and artistry of 
printing and bookmaking, which are things that tend to be 
invisible to us today.... You cant help feeling reverent.
Indeed, even before the digital age, books were a common 
aspect of our learned society that many take for granted. 
Before mass printing was possible, each book produced 
was a laborious artistic effort, employing intricate 
design, immaculate calligraphy, and vivid illustration. 
One of the Hunt collections prized pieces is Horae Beatae 
Mariae Virginis, a Catholic Church manuscript from the 
15th century which may predate the printing press itself. 
This small prayer book is completely hand-written, handillustrated, and hand-constructed: it is one of a kind. Its 
vivid illustrations dont appear to have faded in the least; 
its gilded pages still shimmer. It is not made of paper, 
but of paper-thin sheets of sheepskin called vellum. The 
vellum is a creamy ecru and feels like extremely fine 
suede. Though evidence is inconclusive, the book may 
have been specially crafted for Henri II of France and 
Diane de Poitiers.
Another stunning piece on display is Les Plaisirs de Lisle 
Enchante. Commissioned by Louis XIV, the Sun King 
himself, this seventeenth century volume bears his royal 
seal emblazoned in gold on the dark red front and back 
covers. The Renaissance equivalent of a wedding video, 
the book contains giant, detailed engravings depicting 
a grand festival at the court of Versailles. The book, by
10_llkg.y Sp AIk1mo1d Hvvcy

---------------------------------------------------

17th-century standards, is richly opulent, as befit the 
lifestyle of Louis XIV and his nobles.
But if the prayer book is appropriately small and 
sparkling and Louis XIVs rich red volume is lavish as 
suits a monarch, then Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations, 
in its two hefty volumes bound in solemn brown leather, 
is the perfect vision of timeless scholarship. Published 
in 1776 and idolized by the Founding Fathers, Smiths 
groundbreaking economic theory is the backbone of 
modern commerce.
However, the Fine and Rare Book Room in Hunt Library 
is only half the story. The brand new Posner Center, lying 
between the College of Fine Arts and the Tepper School 
of Business, houses one of the finest collections of rare 
books and artifacts in the world. A gift from Henry Posner 
Jr. and Helen Posner, the Center displays selections from 
the collection of Henry Posner Sr. and his wife Ida. Henry 
Posner Sr. was a master collector. A Polish immigrant 
to Pittsburgh, Posner began collecting in 1924 and 
concentrated on books as artwork; he was attracted to 
exquisitely constructed and adorned volumes. After 1950, 
however, he began to focus on landmarks in the history 
of science. His astounding collection features works from 
virtually every pioneering scientist since the fifteenth 
century: Francis Bacon, Johannes Kepler, Ren Descartes, 
and Albert Einstein, for example. Perhaps the collections 
most priceless piece is an original On the Rotation of the 
Heavenly Orbs by Nicolaus Copernicus (1543). Copernicus 
first conceived the outrageous theory of a heliocentric 
universe, one in which humankind was not the focus of 
the cosmos, but merely a cog in a larger contraption. His 
ideas were substantiated by Galileo Galilei, who faced 
persecution from the Catholic Church for supporting the 
heretical theories of Copernicus. Galileos original works 
(1632) are also part of the Posner collection at Carnegie 
Mellon. As Adam Smith founded modern economics, so 
did Copernicus and Galileo found modern science and 
help shape modern humankinds conception of itself.
Henry Posner Sr. was by no means a dilettante, nor was 
he a disconnected collector. He was passionate about 
science, books, and the history of both. He read each of 
his acquisitions, even teaching himself French and Italian 
so he could read some of his books in their original 
languages. He collected not for prestige, but posterity. 
When a colleague overseas hinted at the possibility of 
buying his collection, Posner responded, I believe I 
should put your mind at rest. My library is not for sale. I am 
not buying books because I think they would appreciate 
in value.... I buy the books because I am interested, and 
I have every reason to believe that they will remain in 
the family.... Of course, should you come to the United
States, I would be delighted to have you as my guest in 
Pittsburgh, and let you take a squint at the only copy of 
the Bill of Rights outside of the Library of Congress.
Indeed, Carnegie Mellon does not own the Posner 
collection  it is still the property of the Posner family. 
However, through their generosity, this world-class 
resource has been made available to the students and 
faculty of CMU and the Pittsburgh community. Having 
these pillars of scientific progress and achievement 
housed here, at a university of unparalleled scientific 
progress and achievement, is both useful and fitting.
The accomplishments of humankind in its short stay 
in existence have so far been staggering. But we must 
remember that curing sickness, venturing into space, 
and looking inward to understand the miracles of biology 
and chemistry are not in themselves noteworthy; rather, 
it is our knowledge of how to do these things that is 
truly remarkable. Therefore, though vaccines and space 
shuttles and atoms may exist in the tangible world,
their real worth is as intangible as the time it has taken 
humanity to discover their secrets. And so, as we inch into 
the future, as the book fades into obsoleteness, we should 
look forward with excitement and back with reverence. 
The mind is built with bricks of books.

Art Meets Science at the Silver Eye
Edgerton Displays Work in Seeing the Unseen
The Silver Eye Center for Photographys 
latest exhibition, Seeing the Unseen, displays 
works from Harold Edgertons photographic 
experiments using an electronic flash. 
Edgertons contribution to the photography 
world goes far beyond just these photographs: 
He invented the strobe while at MIT, originally 
to study motors turning at high speeds. Later, 
his wife suggested he photograph something 
more interesting, and this gave way to 
Edgertons most famous works. He began 
turning his strobe and camera at other objects 
moving at high speeds. Hummingbirds, 
falling water, and his daughter jumping rope 
were all captured in the blink of a shutter, 
and perhaps most famous in his collection are 
bullets shooting through apples, balloons, 
and playing cards.
Edgerton was born in 1903, and earned 
an electrical engineering degree from 
the University of Nebraska. As a graduate 
student at MIT, he began working with the 
stroboscope, combining high shutter speeds 
on a camera and high flashes per second on 
the strobe, inventing ultra-high-speed and 
stop-action photography. For the first time, 
images were taken of people and objects in 
motion with the smallest fragment of time 
stopped. Linda Benedict-Jones, executive 
director of Silver Eye, thinks that this show 
is important not just to photographers, but to 
the scientific community as well.
the water is frozen in time and appears as 
crystals.
The water is frozen because it was 
photographed with a strobe light, she said. 
That strobe is taken for granted. You can buy 
a camera at a drugstore for under $10 with a 
strobe flash. Thats remarkable. BenedictJones hopes the University community will 
find interest in Edgertons work. Its a rare 
treat for physics students, engineers, artists 
and photography students. We will be happy 
to open the gallery outside our normal hours 
for groups of students, even on weekends.
There is also no doubt, especially for 
photographers, that mastering the use 
of strobe flash is difficult in the field of 
photography. The fact that flashes may be 
widely available doesnt make them easy to 
use. Silver Eye has two workshops during this 
exhibition that help photographers become 
better acquainted with the strobe. Lighting 
in a Box! is a workshop on Saturday, March
12, from 8 am to 4 pm, and will be taught 
by Mark Perrott, who also teaches at CMU. 
Perrott will teach the fundamentals of strobe 
lighting for portrait and still life photography. 
Take the Lid Off! will be held on Saturday, 
April 2, from 10 am to 4 pm. This is a lighting 
workshop taught by Duane Rieder at his 
studio. Reservations are required for both 
workshops, since the class size is limited.
Seeing the Unseen is a perfect blend of art and 
science, said Benedict-Jones. Doc Edgerton, 
who made all of these pictures, was initially 
a scientist and an MIT engineer. When he 
discovered electronic flash in the early 1930s, 
he began making pictures primarily for 
scientific purpose.

Editors Note: Natalie Gonzalez is an intern 
at the Silver Eye Center. She was not directly 
involved with this exhibit.
She explained that as Edgerton became more 
involved with his invention, aesthetics became more 
important to the project. Its an honor, said BenedictJones, for Silver Eye to be able to present the work of a 
truly important inventor in the field of photography.
The aesthetic appeal of Edgertons work is apparent upon 
viewing the works on display at the gallery. The scientific 
purpose may be initially present, given his background 
and the history of the strobe, but there is an obvious 
artistic quality to each photograph as well. Details, like 
dressing athletes in black clothing to highlight the objects
they are holding, or composing three balloons in a row, 
show the attention that Edgerton gave to the visual appeal 
and aesthetic beauty of each image. He shot numerous 
photos before he arrived at one he liked, because for him 
it had to be perfect. The milk drop is one example of his 
perfectionism, and the final photograph is a beautiful 
crown against a red background.
There is no doubt that the world of flash photography is 
often taken for granted by photographers and the rest of 
us. Benedict-Jones recalls images of water being dumped 
on head coaches after each Super Bowl, photos in which

Dr. Octagon delivers fresh beats...nine years ago
The second installment of Izzy Gs Underground Classic Records
Artist: Dr. Octagon 
Album: Dr. Octagonecologyst 
Label: DreamWorks 
Year released: 1996
This Album sounds like psychedelic hip-hop. The samples 
are dream-like and comedic. The lyrics are for fans of 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the humor is of a 
sleazy nature. Refreshing song structures, lack of default 
formula of heavy bass, amazing spinning by DJ Q-Bert
 all are features of this album.
Where youve heard this band: XM Radio began its TV 
campaign with Bear Witness.
This album is one of my personal favorites. 1996s 
breakthrough Dr. Octagon record, Dr. Octagonecologyst, 
is easily considered a hip-hop classic  and for good 
reason. The samples are fresh, moving, 
and fluid, and the lyrics are (in censorproof words) out of this world.
At the time of this albums release, the 
state of mainstream hip-hop was full 
of East Coast vs. West Coast rivalries.
Hype was built by artists publicly 
insulting each other, perhaps taking 
their cues from Oasis and Blur. A 
couple shootings gave main-stream 
hip-hop the outlaw image that punk 
rock had carried a decade earlier. As 
for the music and message, playful 
memories of De La Soul and the Fat 
Boys were all but played out.
Then out of nowhere came Kool Keiths 
solo album, where he took on the 
moniker of Dr. Octagon. Kool Keith 
teamed up with Dan the Automator,
DJ Q-Bert and DJ Shadow for what 
became the only Dr. Octagon record.
The album is definitely psychedelic; 
its nods to the rave culture of the time 
were well placed to make the album 
the cross-over underground hit that 
it was. The lyrics are raunchy, but 100 
percent original. And in his follow-up 
album, Kool Keith came back as Dr.
Doom to kill Dr. Octagon in his first 
track.
samples are funky and have a dream-like feel to them. In 
No Awareness, the main rhythm dances like a Brazilian 
samba. Its almost as if hip-hops default volume of 10 
for bass was never necessary. How refreshing is that? 
Very.
Perhaps even more noteworthy are the lyrics. In No 
Awareness, Dr. Octagon raps, Hitting like beepers/beepbeep, vibrate/... sounds my planet is caught/rehearsal is 
a must/lust my vital/is important to fuzz my inhabitants/ 
past ten ever since/presidents Lyndon B, Jerry, John, 
George and Carter/like Optimus deep soul reflects on the 
starter. Then comes a sample of Optimus Prime shouting, 
Megaton Rejuvenate! Its a sure bet to generate smiles 
out of anyone who remembers Transformers, the TV 
cartoon show that was more than meets the eye.
Bear Witness is perhaps one of the more well-known
tracks on this album. The furiously fast, break-dance 
friendly scratching by DJ Q-Bert on this song was the star 
of XM Radios advertising campaign a few years back. 
Kool Keith raps on the track that he creates rap music 
cause I never dug disco. Again, the star of the song is 
the beat.
Though scratching never died out, it lost its popularity 
by the end of the Reagan era. Break-dancing was also a 
casualty of the 1980s. Then, in the mid-1990s, scratching 
had a revival  and break-dancing followed suit. Were 
such events spearheaded by the Dr. Octagon album? 
Probably not, but the underground was beginning to 
strip its sound from the straitjacket formula of the time. 
Dr. Octagon is, in essence, a product of its climate.
The album does have two or three filler tracks. But out 
of 20 tracks, few albums are of such high quality and 
incredible imagination.
Songs such as 3000, Earth People, 
No Awareness, Blue Flowers, 
Bear Witness, Girl Let Me Touch 
You, and the old-school-sounding 
1977 make this a must-own hip-hop 
album.
Youll never hear anything this good or 
this different for a long time. Albums 
like it come once a decade. The tracks 
were the beginning of underground 
hip-hops own identity, and with 
it experimentation, attention, and 
respect for underground labels and 
artists grew. Whether Kool Keith 
meant it or not, he was one of the few 
MCs who accurately predicted truth 
when he said, Rap music moves to 
the year 3000.
Next on the CD changer: Nick Drake 
or Husker Dii.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond JF
A woman with large hair sat at a desk covered in unopened envelopes and brochures for 
Caribbean resorts. She cradled a phone between her ear and shoulder while she filed her 
nails. Her crossed legs revealed the holes in her stockings. The smell of cigarette smoke 
filled the dank real estate office, but Wilbur didnt see anyone smoking. He sneezed.
The woman looked at him as if he had sneezed on purpose to get her attention. One 
second, sir, she said annoyedly. She put the nail file in a drawer and slammed it shut 
as she finished her chattering and hung up the phone. Are ya here to see Carlow? 
she asked. Yes, Wilbur said. I have an appointment. You must be Wilbur, she 
said. Carlow will be with you in a moment. The woman disappeared through a door 
behind her desk that Wilbur hadnt even noticed before. Both it and the wall were 
covered with posters of exotic vacation destinations. Wilbur took a seat and picked up 
a magazine advertising a Norwegian cruise. He was left alone for quite a few minutes, 
and when the door finally reopened, Wilbur was startled. Wilbur! A deep voice 
boomed. Nice to meet you! My names Carlow Brack! Lets send you on a vacation!

HOROSCOPES
BY LARA VOIGT
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Well, every year your star sign is 
associated with the most romantic day of the year... or depressing, your call. But 
good luck finding the connection between the water bearer and finding a date.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Today might not be the day to try your hand at 
romance. Remember sixth grade when you gave your substitute teacher a certain 
present and she scheduled you an appointment with the counselor? Your calculus 
professor isnt going to take it any better than she did.
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): You win some, you lose some. If youre looking for 
a guy this Valentines Day, youre in luck. Look around. Theyre everywhere, and 
chances are they havent gotten a date either.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): You're a bull, so take the plunge and go for what 
you want. If it doesnt work, Im sure you can take your frustration out on all the 
red decorations flying around.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Geminis supposedly have two sides to them. Some 
call this a psychological problem, but view it as a second chance  Im sure one 
of them is likable enough to get a date.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Like your star sign indicates, you grow on people 
 so it looks like youll be busy tonight. Just dont double-book yourself. 
Remember last year?
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Take chances tonight! Youre on top of the world and 
using your romantic prowess, so you might just snag the one you've been watching 
for so long. Then again, its highly possible she knows youve just been watching 
her for a long, long time.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Being your pure Virgo self, youll most 
likely be in your dorm tonight, but Im sure eating ice cream and watching The 
Notebook with the girls will make you appreciate swearing off dating back in high 
school.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Dont run away screaming too quickly on 
that date tonight. Take a breath, look down, and you might just find a curiously 
crumpled-up $20. It might have been dropped by a nervous CS major trying his 
hand at a Valentines date and ending up in a fight over the check, or maybe its 
just a lucky night for you. Either way youre $20 richer.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): When that guy youve had your eye on for 
so long finally asks you to dinner tonight, try not to scare him off by screaming 
Me and you, sittin in a tree... and then asking him what he thinks of the 
promise rings you picked out a month ago. A date with that shy guy is way better 
than the night of cleaning you had planned originally.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Now I know taking Cupid's job in 
your hands sounds like a good idea because youre an archer and all, but walking 
around campus without the magic arrows you ordered three months ago probably 
wont nab that date for tonight. Just stick to being your seductive self this year; 
it will cause fewer problems with the authorities.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): I know desperate times call for 
desperate measures, but when that creepy guy in your mysticism class approaches 
you with a bottle labeled love potion smelling curiously like whiskey, try to 
remember theres always next year and always better options around.

Comickaze
Know Your Publishers! (Part 2)
The glut of comics to choose from can be daunting, so for the 
benefit of new readers, I continue my list of publishers. This 
makes a pretty good heuristic for at-a-glance decisions:
Image Comics
Image Comics began in the early 90s. At that time comics had 
become very lucrative as collectors items, and there was a lot 
of money to be made. The creators, however, rarely saw a cent 
of this. Subsequendy, several dejected writers and artists from 
Marvel and DC broke off to form their own company (read: make 
money hand over fist). Thus Image Comics was formed around 
the principle of creator rights. Its most notorious forefather was 
Todd McFarland, whose hip, edgy superhero Spawn went on 
to make him a millionaire. Their basic business model was to 
market every issue as a collectors item that would accrue in 
value, and use this to inflate the price of their comics. In fact, the 
Wall Street Journal had reported at the time that comics were a 
better long-term investment than stocks. Like all good bubbles, 
this one burst, and Image had to make across the board cuts, 
selling half their characters to DCs new Wildstorm division, 
and reducing their number of active titles. Today Image is this 
twisted oddity, trying in vain to market bland superheroes in a 
market that is shifting towards independent comics. If you like 
that kind of gritty superhero aesthetic, then this is the place for 
you; otherwise its hardly worth the while most of the time, with 
a few notable exceptions like Robert Kirkmans Invincible.
Dark Horse Comics
Mike Richardson was an owner of a chain of comic book shops 
in Portland, Oregon in the mid-80s when he started Dark Horse 
Comics. Today, Dark Horse controls 12 percent of the market, 
and has been called the biggest little bite that anyone has taken 
out of Marvel and DCs empires by Premier magazine. Although 
Dark Horse has created several well-known characters such as 
The Mask and Hellboy, the biggest contributor has been Frank 
made-Batman-what-he-is-today Miller and his epic series Sin 
City (soon to be a major motion picture). Theyve capitalized on 
generic Marvel and DC fans whove become tired with reading 
books with content suitable for all ages, but not into the whole 
independent scene. The biggest chunk of their sales, however, 
has been adaptations. Dark Horse is infamous for their repeated 
adaptations of Aliens, Predator, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and (of 
course) Star Wars. Additionally, Dark Horses Studio Proteus is 
the only quality translator of Japanese manga. Dark Horse has 
been responsible for the successful importation of Ghost in the 
Shell, Akira, Blade of the Immortal, Astro Boy, and Lone Wolf and 
Cub. A good rule of thumb is this: Dark Horse gets the best of the 
East, and Tokyopop gets all the other unreadable tripe.
Antarctic Press
AP Comics produces what most readers pejoratively refer to as 
American Manga. Much of it is teen-directed schlock, but some 
tides are genuinely funny, like Ninja High School and Gold Diggers. 
AP is probably best known for its droves of How to Draw Manga
books. If stuff that looks like Internet fan art doesnt appeal to 
you, then you probably wont be into these books at a glance 
anyway; but if my bias hasnt been too much to turn you off, then 
youre probably the kind of person who would really appreciate 
their books.
The Dennis Kitchen Publishing Co.
Dennis Kitchen holds the licenses to several golden and silver age 
characters, and regularly publishes anthologies. In particular, 
they have the rights to the estates of Will Eisner, Harvy Kurtzman, 
A1 Capp, Russel Keaton, Peter Poplaski, and Kellie Strom. If youre 
not going to read the classics occasionally, you might as well not 
read good comics at all (in my most humble of opinions).
Top Shelf Productions
Top Shelf bills its comics as produced with handsome packaging, 
an attention to detail, and a generous amount of tender loving 
care. Top Shelf certainly goes the mile in attempting to sell comic 
books rather than comic magazines. All of their works are hard
bound, and you usually have to go to an actual bookstore to find 
them. Their books are contemplative, and sometimes religious 
or political. Theyre not surrealistically artsy, though, as some 
independent publishers are. Good examples are Unmarketable 
by Tom Hart, Blankets by Craig Thompson, and Creature Tech 
by Earthworm Jim creator Doug TenNapel. Most importantly, 
though, Top Shelf Productions publishes James Kochalkas 
masterpiece Monkey Vs. Robotl Yes!
Crossgen Comics
Crossgen Comics attempts to blend the Marvel/DC idea of 
a complete, overarching universe between their different 
comics with a fantasy rather than superhero theme. The art is 
tolerable, and the stories are pretty bland, but at least its not 
more superheroes. Some friends of mine adore these comics, so 
I suppose they appeal to a very particular taste. The interleaved 
plot arcs have become rather involved, but they have verbose 
synopses on their website. Crossgen is okay; they certainly have 
their niche.
In Other News
I dont know why Bryan OMalleys Scott Pilgrims Precious Little 
Life has been coming up every week this semester, but The 
Hollywood Reporter reported (as is its function) that Shaun of 
the Dead co-writer Edgar Wright is lining up to write a screen 
adaptation of the comic about a boy who can only win his true 
loves heart by defeating her seven evil ex-boyfriends. Hurray!
