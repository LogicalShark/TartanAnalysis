Student forum investigates apathy
By ANWESHA RAKSHIT
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday, CMU stu
dents gathered to discuss, 
among other things, whether 
Carnegie Mellon University 
is an apathetic community.
Approximately 60 students 
attended the forum, An 
Awakening of Conciousness 
A panel of four guests, which 
consisted of Professor Scott 
Sandage from the History 
Department, Kellie Fenton 
from Amnesty International, 
Maurice Parent from Spirit, 
and John Lacny from the 
Students in Solidarity orga
nization at the University 
of Pittsburgh, presided over 
the forum.
I dont think the CMU 
community is apathetic. One
of the greatest things I love 
about Carnegie Mellon is the 
energy that people have, 
said AbhisekMitra, a junior 
double major in philosophy 
and ethics, history, and pub
lic policy who helped in or
ganizing the forum. I be
lieve that we have a tremen
dous diversity on this cam
pus. Unfortunately much of 
this diversity is not heard or 
seen. But it exists.
Various campus issues as 
well as community and na
tional issues were brought 
up during the forum. Some 
of these included CMUs 
military contracts, the tu
ition hike, the minority and 
gender issues in faculty em
ployment, the possible ex
ecution of Mumia AbuJamal in early May, police
brutality, apathy to social 
causes, and the recent stu
dent body elections turnout.
Fenton, who is the presi
dent of Amnesty Interna
tional, described people at 
CMU as apathetic to social 
causes by sharing with the 
group how difficult it was to 
get people involved. She went 
on to describe a scenario 
where she had lured people 
to a coffee house to write let
ters supporting an important 
cause by telling them how 
great the music and food was 
at the coffee house. She 
asked, is it necessary to mis
lead students to get them to 
be more involved?
Mitra said he disagreed, 
finding it unnecessary. He 
believed that people should 
support a cause because they
feel that it is important, not 
because theyre bored or 
have been misled into sup
porting it. Activism for its 
[own] sake or because youre 
bored is not a direction we 
want to take. We are 
not going to blindly go in 
and start whatever were 
doing, he said. As long as 
we have the support, and 
students believe its impor
tant and claim that they 
want to give their support 
and lend a hand, then we 
can make a difference and 
we can succeed.
Luke Brindle, a sophomore 
English major who helped 
organize the forum, asked 
the group who would be at 
the next meeting. Almost

University of Pittsburgh paper sues state
By SRINIVAS PULLELA
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Tuesday, the Univer
sity of Pittsburghs daily 
newspaper, in conjunction 
with the American Civil Lib
erties Union (ACLU), filed a 
lawsuit against the C ommonwealth of Pennsylvania dis~ 
puting the constitutionality 
of Act 199, a state law pro
hibiting alcohol-related ad
vertisements from appearing 
in university publications.
Under Act 199, advertise
ments with mention of alco
hol are not permitted in any 
medium produced for or by 
an educational institution.
The Pitt News is challeng
ing the law primarily on the 
grounds that it violates the 
First Amendment right to 
free speech.
Harold Turner, editor-inchief of the The Pitt News, 
believes that this right per
tains to both commercial and 
noncommerical speech, es
pecially when the printed 
material is about a legal 
product. The state should 
have no say whatsoever in
what goes into this newspa
per, he said.
In late 1997, at least one 
restaurant in Oakland was 
fined for placing an adver
tisement in The Pitt News 
that mentioned alcohol. 
Since then, several other 
parties have pulled their 
advertisements out of the 
paper. The Pitt News esti
mates that up to $20,000 in 
revenue was lost as a result.
According to Turner, The 
Pitt News had a very tight 
budget this year. Meeting 
expenses for equipment
and salaries was a chal
lenge, he said.
Turner says the primary 
issue, however, is not the 
financial impact of Act 199, 
but the violation of rights. ! 
Even if we were making 
money, wed be fighting 
this, he said.
Witold Walczak, president 
of the Pittsburgh chapter of ; 
ACLU, is representing the i 
students in the lawsuit. In 
an article printed in the ' 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last |

THE TARTAN
Controversy surrounds funding
By ANNE RAY
Dossier Literary Editor
All Carlos Moreno wants to do 
is produce a yearbook. All the 
Student Senate wants to do is act 
in the best interest of its constitu
ents. The same goes for the 
Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA). All most student organi
zations want is funding to run a 
club, or have an activity. But 
somehow, in a GSA/Student Sen
ate joint meeting last Thursday, 
all these goals began to conflict.
An appeal was made in last 
Thursda/s meeting that might 
have prevented The Thistle year
book from running under a defi
cit. The meetings purpose was 
for the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC)  a committee formed of 
members of Student Senate and 
GSA to fund student organiza
tions  to present its final pro
posal to Senate and GSA. The 
proposal contained the budgets 
of more than 60 organizations, 
which must be approved in order 
for funding to be issued. This 
meeting is the last crucial step in 
a longbudgeting process that hap
pens each year.
A last-minute change, which 
many Senators feel was inappro
priately glossed over by mem
bers of GSA, was made to The 
Thistle's budget, reducing their 
subsidy by almost $10,000 Carlos 
Moreno, Thistle's editor-in-chief,
said such a reduced subsidy may 
make it impossible to produce 
the yearbook without running a 
large deficit.
This incident, according to JFC 
Chair Drew Stovall, shows the 
rift between the needs of gradu
ate students and of undergradu
ates  a problem that may be a 
hindrance to student organiza
tions just looking for funding, like 
The Thistle. When Funding & 
Recognition Chair Mike Strauss 
raised the appeal, graduate stu
dents voted in favor of the re
duced subsidy.
It became clear that GSA was 
in not in support of making the 
right decision, said Stovall, a 
senior physics major. [They] 
were in support of not having a 
meeting again, which I found very 
irresponsible.
In addition, several student 
organizations were left out of
the budgeting process entirely - 
indicative of overall -problems 
with the distribution of informa
tion, according to Strauss, a se
nior computer science major. The 
Russian house, the Volleyball 
Club, and the Varsity Club were 
all left out of the process, for lack 
of information about deadlines 
and policies.
Strauss said that one solution 
Senate plans to implement is the 
distribution of a fiscal policy 
packet, given to every student 
organization that registers for the
Activities Fair. In the past, main
taining up-to-date contact infor
mation for student organizations 
from year to year has been prob
lematic, Strauss said.
Student Activities doesnt even 
have a really up-to-date contact 
list, he said.
In The Thistles case, they had 
all the information, and were 
given a recommendation from the 
JFC to reduce the number ofbooks 
produced, and raise the price of 
each book. The subsidy would 
have been reduced from around 
$33,000 to around $23,000, ac
cording to Stovall. The Thistle 
staff members appealed the bud
get, in an effort to keep the cost of 
each book at around $45, but no 
changes were made.
[The decision to approve a re
duced subsidy] will make it very 
difficult for The Thistle, said 
Student Body President and jun
ior history major Sarah Gross. 
Theyll be burdened for the en
tire year of having this ridicu
lous expectation of selling so 
many books ... when most of the 
board doesnt feel thats possible 
.... They will be the ones stu
dents complain to when the year
book is so expensive.
Gross has veto power over the 
entire JFC proposal, which she 
must exercise within several days.
Moreno, a junior mechanical 
engineering major, said he is con
cerned at having to produce a 
yearbook under such financial 
constraints, as well as for the 
well-being of his organization.
A lot of the people who are now 
in positions are not eager to con
tinue, given such meager sup
port, Moreno said. The people 
who are working on [the year
book] refuse to raise the price .... 
Its disappointing, and I 
understand where Senates comVoluml mll e,iMniUs 2uCl a

President holds meeting
for concerned students
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Personnel Manager
presidents house is one of those things where no 
one is happy about acquiring it, including me, but 
once you have it, youll be happy for it.
He also said that the house will cost the Univer
sity either nothing or close to nothing since the 
money will come from the sale of the presidents 
current house and from gifts that can only be used 
towards the house.
With the announcement of a 3.9 percent tuition 
increase for next year, the purchase of a $1.7 
million house for the president, and the filming of 
a major motion picture on campus, President Jared 
Cohon decided to address these concerns last 
Wednesday in a nhour-long 
town meeting with students.
First of all, I think its fair 
to say things are going well 
here at CMU, said Cohon in 
his opening remarks, citing a 
record number of applicants, 
positive feedback from vari
ous advisory boards, and the 
conclusion of the development 
of a strategic plan.
Cohon also said, however, 
that there are still areas that 
need improvement and ex
plained that he is aware of 
some of the concerns that stu
dents have. Anticipating some 
questions that he felt were 
inevitable, Cohon initially ad
dressed five issues: the tuition 
increase, the presidents 
house commencement the President Cohon held a town meeting last Wednesday.in McConomy.
Wonder Boys movie, and building on campus. Cohon said that he made a mistake in his deciAccording to Cohon, tuition represents about sion to have no keynote speaker at this years
70 percent of what it actually costs to educate a 
student here, and the increase is necessary to 
continue maintaining a high level of education. 
In addition, he mentioned that the Universitys 
chief competitors, such as Cornell, Stanford, and 
Washington University in St. Louis, each have 
increases that are over four percent for next year. 
CMU is also more tuition-dependent than these 
other schools, said Cohon, since these schools 
have endowments that are two to five times 
larger than CMUs.
Cohon then, went on to discuss the presidents 
new house. Its valuable to the University 
because it will be used in many, many ways for 
important university functions,  said Cohon.
Its something youre going to be proud of. A
commencement, and announced that he is now 
actively working with students to identify a speaker 
for this years ceremony.
The next topic addressed was the filming of the 
Wonder Boys movie on campus. We know its 
been annoying and inconvenient for some of you, 
said Cohon.
He explained that the Universitys decision was 
based on trying to promote economic activity in 
Pittsburgh, because it had education value, and 
because it promoted Carnegie Mellon. In addition, 
the University is receiving money for the movie, and 
aside from what is being used to defray costs, the rest 
is being distributed back to the units on campus that 
have received most of the impact. Despite some small

Niger searches for 
new head of state
NIAMEY, Niger (AP)  One day 
after President Ibrahim Bare 
Mainassara was gunned down by 
members of his own Presidential 
Guard, Nigers military leadership 
met with civilian politicians Satur
day to select a new head of state.
While it remained unclear who was 
behind the shooting, observers said 
the killing appeared to have support 
among Nigers often-fractious mili
tary, which took control of the West 
African nation after the attack.
The lack of army infighting and the 
quick deployment of soldiers in the 
streets of Niamey, the capital, after 
the killing appeared to indicate that 
at least some military units were be
hind the assassination, diplomats and 
local journalists said.
Although a new president was ex
pected to be chosen Saturday, there 
were indications by nightfall that the 
announcement could be postponed 
until after Bares burial Sunday in 
his home village of Doumega, 150 
miles east of Niamey near Nigers 
southern border with Nigeria.
Official announcements insisted Sat
urday that Bare died in an unfortunate 
accident, but witnesses and diplomats 
said he had been cut down Friday morn
ing by heavy machine-gun fire at the 
Niamey airportby members ofthe Presi
dential Guard, a military unit that pro
tects the presidential palace.
Hours after Bares killing, Prime 
Minister Ibrahim Assane Mayaki dis
banded the National Assembly  
which is dominated by members of 
Bares party  and temporarily sus
pended all political parties.
The country of 9.7 million people, 
on the southern edge of the Sahara 
Desert, is one of the worlds poorest.
Bare, who seized power himself in a 
1996 coup, was not a popular leader. 
He faced down repeated military mu
tinies during his tenure, imprisoned 
opposition figures, and reportedly in
stalled family members in highly prof
itable government jobs.
Any military takeover anywhere in 
the world is out of fashion and should 
be regarded as unfortunate, said 
Olusegun Obasanjo, president of 
neighboring Nigeria. Any short-cir
cuit of democracy is not in the best 
interest of the people.
Bare was shot repeatedly by Presi
dential Guard members as he crossed 
the tarmac to board a helicopter in a 
remote corner of the Niamey airport, 
the sources said. Some reports said 
hed been nearly cut in half by gunfire.
He was leaving to visit a town near 
Nigers border with Mali at the time of 
the shooting, and was not believed to 
be fleeing.
Western diplomats, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said Bares 
bodyguard unit had been suddenly 
replaced before the assassination  
another sign that at least some ele
ments in the military appeared to 
back his killing.
Bares assassination capped a tu
multuous week. The opposition had 
called for his resignation, accusing his 
government of orchestrating attacks 
against polling workers tallying re
sults from Februarys regional and 
municipal elections.
Bare, a former army colonel, seized 
power three years earlier by ousting 
the countrys first democratically 
elected government. He placed thenPresident Mahamane Ousmane un
der house arrest but released him 
three months later.
U.S., China open agriculture trade
WASHINGTON (AP)  After days of 
haggling over a deal that would lower 
Chinese trade barriers for American 
farmers, the United States and China 
finally signed an agreement Saturday 
that opens Chinese markets to Ameri
can wheat, beef, and citrus.
This agreement addresses a long
standing concern of American farmers 
and 1 was proud to make their 
case directly, Vice President A1 Gore 
said in a statement issued through 
a spokesman.
A tentative agreement had been an
nounced on Thursday but hit a snag 
when it became clear broader issues 
concerning Chinas entry into the World 
Trade Organization would not be re
solved during a visit to Washington by 
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
The freeze began to thaw during a 
Friday meeting between Gore and Zhu 
that had been scheduled to last about a 
half hour, but stretched into well over an 
hour, administration officials said.
The vice president really pushed the 
issue and essentially reopened the dis
cussion, a White House source, who 
asked not to be identified, said Satur
day. Early this morning they put pen to 
paper. Its a done deal.
Under the agreement, China agreed 
to lift its bans on shipments of wheat 
from the Pacific Northwest and citrus 
from Florida, Texas, and California.
China had imposed long-standing bans 
on those products on the grounds of 
worries about plant diseases. U.S. pro
ducers complained the bans were not 
based on sound science but were hidden 
trade barriers. The Chinese also agreed 
to eliminate burdensome inspection re
quirements that had severely restricted 
the amount of U.S. beef that could be 
sold in China.
The deal brings a sigh of relief from 
the U.S. farm industry as well as many 
on Capitol Hill, who viewed the opened
markets as a boon for an agricultural 
economy that has been severely impacted 
in the last year by lagging imports and 
low prices.
The citrus portion alone is expected 
to be worth $1.2 billion in trade for 
one year.
China initially agreed to the deal on 
the assumption it would get U.S. ap
proval for an overall package that would 
have allowed China to enter the World 
Trade Organization.
China had already signed separate 
deals earlier in the week covering avia
tion and opening up its vast telecom
munications and insurance markets to 
U.S. companies. China agreed to double 
the frequency of flights between the 
United States and China under the 
aviation deal.Russians finalize plans for space
MOSCOW (AP)  The crucial third 
piece of the international space station 
will be transported to the Baikonur 
cosmodrome next month and is likely to 
be launched in September, Russian 
space officials said Friday.
Russia has repeatedly delayed the 
launch, frustrating its foreign partners 
and pushing up expenses for the overall 
space station.
We are planning our work based on 
the estimate that launch preparations 
at the cosmodrome will take four to 
four-plus months, the head of the Rus
sian Space Agency, Yuri Koptev, told 
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
Koptev said a more precise launch 
date will be announced in June.
Eight months of work would bump 
the launch of the service module 
to December.
ITAR-Tass reported that experts at 
Russias RKKEnergiya company, which 
is outfitting the module, have blamed 
the delay on errors in calculationsnot 
Russias financial problems, as others 
have claimed.
NASA, a key player in the interna
tional space station, has said that engi
neers typically need four to eight months 
at the launch site to prepare a space 
station component for flight.Futurists market smart trash cans
DAYTON, Ohio (AP)  Out of tuna 
fish? Low on pasta? Just toss your empty 
cans and boxes into the trash and your 
shopping will be done.
Futuristic fantasy? Maybe not, says 
NCR Corp.
The Dayton-based company said Fri
day it has developed a trash receptacle 
that translates coding on empty con
tainers into a shopping list that can be 
wired to retailers for delivery.
Its a research project at the mo
ment, said Stephen Emmott, director 
of NCRs Knowledge Lab in London, 
England. But there is a fully working 
prototype in the lab.
Emmott said the Intelligent Bin is 
embedded with a microprocessor that 
reads product identification codes. The 
information is transmitted wirelessly 
either to a computer or special electronic 
box, which compiles a list of the dis
carded items.
That list can then be sent to retailers 
over the Internet, or consumers can sim
ply use the device to create their own 
shopping list, Emmott said.
The benefit to consumers is this in
credible convenience, to automatically 
be able to reorder things, he said.
Emmott said it would also give retail
ers a better idea of what consumers like 
and take some of the guesswork out of 
marketing. Merchants could tailor dis
count coupons and special offers based 
on consumption patterns.
If they know a particular consumer is 
consuming ice cream and also throws a 
package of strawberries away, they be
gin to learn consumer habits, he said.
The trash cans could be on the market 
within five to 10 years, Emmott said.
Weather hampers NATO bomb runs over holiday weekend
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
 Despite bad weather limiting 
NATO air operations, bombs fell 
on Kosovo and air-raid sirens 
blared in several other Yugoslav 
cities Saturday, the eve of Chris
tian Orthodox Easter.
Dismissing a holiday weekend 
"cease-fire as a sham, NATO sig
naled there was little likelihood 
of a letup in airstrikes on Sun
day, the day Serbians celebrate 
Easter. The alliance also re
ported Saturday that the cam
paign had so far destroyed half 
of Yugoslavias most modern 
fighter planes.
Air-raid alerts were declared 
Saturday night in Nis, Kragujevac, 
Novi Sad, and the capital, 
Belgrade. Earlier Saturday 
evening, Yugoslav media reported 
that three missiles hit Slatina air
port near Pristina, the provincial 
capital of Kosovo. There were no 
reports of damage or casualties 
immediately available.
The head of the Serbian Ortho
dox church, dressed in a tradi
tional white and gold gown, con
ducted midnight mass for sev
eral hundred people at the Ca
thedral Church in downtown 
Belgrade. A priest read the Eas
ter address from Patriarch Pavle 
and his bishops.
We pray for peace and good will 
among people, but now we are 
suffering, the statement 
said. All just proposals for a peace
ful solution for the Kosovo prob
lem based on respect for all people 
have been rejected. NATO has 
offered only a cynical explanation 
about the necessity of bombing to 
prevent a human catastrophe.
Just hours earlier, a somber 
milestone in the humanitarian 
crisis passed: The number of refu
gees fleeing or driven out of 
Kosovo during the 18-day crisis 
has topped half a million, a scale 
of human displacement not seen 
in Europe since World War II.
The latest figures compiled by 
the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees estimate the exodus at
521,000 people, the vast majority 
of them ethnic Albanians.
In Tirana, Albania, interna
tional officials reported that 
more than 4,000 new refugees 
from Kosovo crossed the Alba
nian border Saturday and hun
dreds more were lined up on the 
Yugoslav side.
Yugoslavia for several days has 
vacillated between opening bor
der points and pushing ethnic 
Albanians out, or closing cross
ings and urging people to return 
to their homes.
From inside Kosovo, the ethnic 
Albanian Kosovo Liberation 
Army said Serb forces continued 
to hunt its soldiers and terrorize 
civilians. Exhausted refugees who 
escaped the province told har
rowing stories.
The rebel-run Kosovapress on 
Saturday reported the bombard
ment of two western villages the 
night before and new fighting in 
the mining town of Stari Trg in 
northern Kosovo.
National Public Radio reported 
Saturday that the United States 
had aerial photographs of 96 
freshly dug graves outside 
Orahovac, where refugees have 
reported the massacre of dozens 
of ethnic Albanian civilians.
David Scheffer, the U.S. am
bassador at large for war crimes, 
said the new graves inside an old 
cemetery could hold evidence of 
a massacre.
The method of burial is very 
very different from traditional 
Albanian burial pattern, 
Scheffer told NPR. We also see 
trekkage of heavy vehicles 
present near the area.
Western aid agencies and 
NATO have both been express
ing deep concern about the fate 
of ethnic Albanians driven from 
their homes in Kosovo but
unable to escape the province. 
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea 
said Saturday an estimated
200,000 people were believed 
displaced within Kosovo and 
were prisoners within their 
own country.
Theyre moving around, thats 
clear, trying to find shelter, try
ing to find food, he said.
Rain and clouds were keeping 
NATO from attacking Yugoslav 
units on the ground. Col. Konrad 
Freytag, briefing reporters at 
NATO headquarters, said poor 
conditions had forced the allies to 
cancel three of the four planned 
waves of attack aircraft in the 
previous 24 hours. The forecast 
called for more bad weather in 
the next few days.
But NATO promised the bomb
ing campaign will go on as long 
as necessary until Milosevic 
withdraws Yugoslav and Serb 
units sent to Kosovo as part of his 
crackdown on the separatist KLA.
When the weather clears, the 
bombing will continue with in
creasing ferocity, said Doug 
Henderson, the British armed 
forces minister.
To add to the strength of NATO 
forces in the region, the Penta
gon will send 82 more U.S. planes 
to join the air campaign, spokes
man Kenneth Bacon said Satur
day. But it could take a month for 
24 Apache attack helicopters to 
arrive in Albania, he added.
Britain said Saturday it is 
sending the aircraft carrier HMS 
Invincible to the Adriatic to bol
ster NATO forces as well. Now in 
the Persian Gulf, it can carry up 
to 24 aircraft.
In a briefing on the damage 
done by NATO airstrikes so far, 
Shea said Saturday that half of 
Yugoslavias MiG-29 fighters 
have now been destroyed. Fuel 
depots, communication centers 
and supply lines also have been 
hit hard, he said.

50 YEARS AGO, March 30, 
1949  Students who felt that 
they didnt get to see the presi
dent of the school enough were 
pleased to learn that President 
Doherty would be holding a se
ries of social meetings at his home.
The meetings were designed 
not as a forum for student gripes; 
rather, they would serve as gath
erings where students and the 
president could get to know each 
other better.
25 YEARS AGO, April 9, 
1974  Student Senate post
poned its spring elections by one 
week due to a series of confus
ing events.
Senate, for one, did not find out 
until the previous week that the 
person who was expected to run 
the election had resigned two 
weeks prior.
In addition, petitions for 
candidates were received almost 
a month later than they had 
been expected.
As a result of the confusion, 
Senate passed a motion to post
pone elections in order to better 
organize them and to get a better 
voter turnout.
10 YEARS AGO, April 18, 
1989  Dr. John Christian 
Warner, former president of Car
negie Tech and the man after 
whom Warner Hall is named, died 
at the age of 91.
Warner was a nationally re
nowned chemist who worked on 
the famous Manhattan Project 
that helped develop the first 
nuclear weapons during World 
War II.
In 1950, Warner became presi
dent of Carnegie Tech. His ad
ministration added a computation 
center in 1956 and helped put the 
University on the map as a center 
of research in computer science.
The campus, during his ten
ure, expanded nearly 20 percent 
due to gifts and purchases made 
under his leadership.
Warner was succeeded in 1965 
by H. Guyford Stever, and was 
honored by the University in 1966 
when the administration com
pleted John C. Warner Hall.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 11, 
1994  Spring Carnival prepa
rations were underway for the

in Canada.
Bands included guitar and vio

well as alternative band Belly, 
the Carnival headliner.
ONE YEAR AGO,. April 13, 
1998  Computing Services an
nounced that it would be phasing 
out the Andrew Message System 
(AMS) for the upcoming year. 
Incoming freshmen, instead, 
would be using the Cyrus mail
ing system.
The main feature of Cyrus that 
makes it different from AMS is 
the ability to access email more 
easily from multiple computers. 
Messages, instead of being 
downloaded to the users com
puters after being read, are in
stead stored on the server until 
deleted. Students already on AMS 
would not have to change.

Registration Process
Use Course Information Online (CIO) before registration week to :
 check course prerequisites against your schedule
 check available course section .
- display sections maximum enrollments, waitlist size, day/time/ 
location, instructor
- display sections reservations, course messages
 check if there is a scat for you - displays each section and its 
CURRENT availability for you.
Use Student Information Online (SIO) before registration week to:
 check your enrollment status for fall '99
 check your primary department, class standing and maximum units 
to register
 check to see if youre on registration hold for fall 99. Contact your 
primary department if you arc.
Use On Line Registration (OLR) during registration week to :
 add and drop courses
 rank your waitlist entries
 check if there is a seat for you - displays each section and its 
CURRENT availability for you. Dont waste time trying to add 
sections not available to you.
 communicate with your advisor or the OLR feedback.
y, CMhtU ON STUDENT FEEDBACK........Is there a seat for me ?
CIO and OLR via the Section Status buttons, will allow students to test if a 
course is available to them. While a seat may be CURRENTLY available, it 
may be available for other students who meet the course reservations as 
well. It is possible that a seat in this course will not be available by the time 
you actually attempt to register for it.
12. Based ON STUDENT FEEDBACK......ahenMg dot iMadnahd,
The waitlist size will be displayed for each section on CIO and OLR. Stu
dents will be abie to view the size of the waitlist on the section status buttons 
on CIO and OLR. This was the most requested change to OLR based on the 
student feedback.
c, mMadnahd wMrlaru
Waitlist Ranking will be introduced in the fall 99 registration process. This 
is an opportunity for students to order their waitlist entries to indicate a 
preference. The ranking will be used as a tool to better understand students 
overall course demands. Students have the opportunity to re-rank their waitlist 
entries throughout the registration and add/drop periods using the Rank WL 
button on OLR. If they choose not to rank their waitlist a ranking will be 
based on the date/time stamp of their waitlist entries.
These are the responses you will get:
TvManMpnt
There is a seat available for you in this section. While a seat may be 
currently available, it may be available to other students who meet the 
reservation criteria as well. It is possible that a seat in this section will not 
be available by the time you actually attempt to register for it.

ing from, but I dont think they under
stand all of the issues involved. Senate 
has demonstrated often enough that 
theyre not in touch with the student 
population, and Im not in a position to 
change that.
Although Tim Rogers, president of GSA, 
could not be reached for comment, GSA 
; treasurer Rick Romero, a graduate stu
dent in computer science, pointed out that 
GSA just wanted to avoid spending su
perfluous meeting time on an issue that
doesnt really affect graduate students.
Undergraduates, from GSAs perspec
tive, have issues very separate from us, 
said Romero. GSA just doesnt really 
care that much about [The Thistle] to be 
honest.... The process says that if Thistle 
has a grievance, they should initially 
bring it forward to the JFC beforehand. 
[GSA members] were happy to take the 
JFC proposal. It should have been 
handled before the meeting.
At the same time, Romero said that 
he, like other student groups, felt that
the budgeting process came up quickly, 
with little warning from Senate.
I dont know if thats because I just 
wasnt on the right mailing list or what, 
Romero said. But they did accommo
date those who seemed to have the same 
experience that I did.

Senate, and between student organiza

President provides 
insight on campus
v9t9is PScb 2uCl A
problems, Cohon said that the Univer
sity has been pleased with their decision 
and would consider doing it again.
Finally, Cohon briefly discussed cam
pus buildings and construction. He said 
that the Purnell Center and the new 
computer science building are on sched
ule. In addition, he said that, while not 
officially announced, the University has 
plans to add a new wing to Baker Hall 
and add a floor to Posner Hall. He also 
cited the new football field and upcom
ing housing renovations as other ex
amples of some of the ways he feels the 
campus is being improved.
Cohon then opened up the floor for 
students to ask questions. When asked 
about the Universitys future, Cohon 
said that he expects to see a more 
academically integrated university. 
One of the things youll notice when 
you come back 10 years from now is 
that no one will be saying Im a second 
class citizen because I major in H&SS 
or CFA,  he said. [You will say] that 
CMU has become a true university in 
recognizing the value of all areas that 
people pursue. He also predicted that 
Pittsburgh will be known as a major 
technology center, and foresaw fur
ther advancement of the arts in the 
city. Finally, Cohon said that the Old 
Gym would finally be renovated.
This comment provoked a more de
tailed question about why the con
struction of the gym has been moving 
so slowly. Cohon explained that while 
he wishes it could move more quickly, 
he felt the other construction projects 
should receive greater priority.
Student involvement and spirit was 
another issue that was brought up.
Cohon said that one problem is that sepa
rating people into colleges when they 
first get here gives them the message 
that people belong in certain places. He 
said that, while some of this division is 
necessary, starting next year, H&SS and 
MCS will have joint admissions so that 
students will be able to apply to what 
seems like a college of arts and sciences.
Finally, Cohon addressed the topic of 
rankings and explained why CMUs 
ranking is a bit lower than might be 
expected. According to Cohon, the rank
ing system is very complex and CMUs 
small endowment and low retention rate 
have been the factors that have hurt the 
University over the years.
Although the event was held in the 
450-seat auditorium, only about 20 stu
dents showed up. I was concerned by 
the lack of attendance, said Melissa 
Palombi, a sophomore drama major. 
One of the things brought up was the 
lack of unity. Part of unity means being 
concerned about the campus, and only 
about 20 people showed up to hear the 
president speak.
Cohon, however, said he was not as 
concerned by the lack of attendance. 
This didnt surprise me. I recognize this 
was not the best time of the year to do 
this, he said, adding that many stu
dents are busy with schoolwork and pre
paring for Spring Carnival.
The president said that he plans to hold 
similar town meetings in the future. I 
would like to do it once a semester or once 
a year, he said. I think late February or 
early March might be a good time because 
it is before Carnival but late enough that 
tuition has been approved by the Board of 
Trustees, which is a concern that I know is 
important to students.

Students hold forum to 
discuss CMU activism
e93,Is PScb 2uCl A
room responded enthusiastically. 
From the response we found, I 
would expect the same amount of 
people there at the next forum. I 
also expect that some will bring 
their friends, said Mitra.
Joe Valeri, a junior English 
major and another student who 
helped organize the forum, said 
that he believes CMU is, to some 
extent, apathetic.
I dont think CMU is being 
more involved, but hopefully, 
this can be changed by instilling 
a new set of values, introducing 
a restructured order of prioritized 
thinking, and giving people a 
little shove in the right direction 
through positive leadership 
and setting examples, said 
Valeri. I think that the forum 
did what it was supposed to do. 
Looking at it constructively, it 
was a foundation or building 
block for the future, but it didnt 
actually do anything.
Jaroslav Delapedreja, a senior 
in computer science with a 
double major in history and pub
lic policy, said that the work 
culture at CMU was great in 
many ways. We have students 
here who pursue their work with 
real passion, and their accom
plishments are truly beautiful, 
he said.
However, he added that some 
use the work culture as an excuse 
to refrain from doing any extra 
work. Two semesters ago, a time 
and stress study by psychology 
professor Ken Kotovsky showed
that CMU students, on average, 
do not really work more than stu
dents at other universities.
Delapedreja discovered another 
reason for apathy in the CMU 
community. Some number of 
CMU students actually do care 
about politics and would like 
to get involved, but very few or
ganizations exist on campus to 
help these students meet each 
other and realize that they are 
not alone. So they may just 
give up and start to think 
that student activism is not 
something that happens at col
leges anymore, because they dont 
see any of it at CMU, he said. 
Two weeks ago, The New York 
Times featured an article about 
the rise of student activism, par
ticularly in regards to sweatshop 
conditions at the factories that 
make clothes with collegiate 
logos. It showed me that student 
activism is alive and well at many 
universities, and that CMU, not 
me, was the weird exception.
We plan to increase involve
ment by creating a new political 
organization on campus, that . 
would use forums similar to last 
weeks to help bring together stu
dents and make them aware of 
important political issues and ex
isting activist groups that are 
working on those issues. Its di
rection is not set in stone yet, 
said Delapedreja.
The organization plans to hold 
future meetings to discuss topics 
such as peace and justice, and 
social security and welfare.
Corrections/Clarifications...
Last weeks Features section contained an organizational 
chart describing communication within student government. 
In this chart, there should have been a line drawn from the 
student body president to Graduate Student Assembly, as the 
president has frequent communication with GSA. In addition, 
Michael Murphy is not the only person in the administration 
with whom Senate communicates. Another example of an 
administrative link is President Cohon.
Also last week, the article CMU students win government 
scholarships, Kyle Dupre will be attending the Universitaet 
Mannheim, not the Wissenschaftliche Hochschule fuer 
Unternehmensfuhrung (WHU) in Mannheim, as part of his 
Fulbright Scholarship.

Law violates First 
Amendment rights
In December 1996, Pennsylva
nia legislators passed a law stat
ing that no advertisement pro
moting alcohol shall appear in 
any publication affiliated with an 
educational institution. This law 
recently struck home for The Pitt 
News when a number of advertis
ers pulled their ads upon learn
ing of the law. As a result, the 
newspaper, along with the Uni
versity of Pittsburghs American 
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stu
dent club, filed a lawsuit against 
the Commonwealth in U.S. dis
trict court last week, stating that 
the law violated its First Amend
ment rights. The Pitt News is to 
be commended for standing up 
for its rights as a newspaper and 
for setting an example for other 
college media sources.
The purpose of a campus news
paper is not only to serve as a 
media source for the campus com
munity, but also to give students 
the opportunity to learn about 
journalism. Laws such as the one 
currently challenged by The Pitt 
News harm a newspapers ability 
to provide the appropriate envi
ronment  one in which the pa
per has total control over its con
tent and thus hamper students 
opportunity to practice journal
ism in a realistic setting.
Legal precedent against the law 
already exists. In 1996, the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that a Rhode 
Island ban on alcohol advertising
in all media was unconstitutional. 
As a result, a similar law was 
struck down in Pennsylvania and 
replaced with the current statute.
There is no reason why a college 
newspaper should be treated any 
differently than a professional 
one. If a bar or restaurant wishes 
to reach a student audience with 
an ad that mentions alcohol, it 
need only look to other papers, 
such as the Pittsburgh City Paper 
and In Pittsburgh, which are dis
tributed freely on college cam
puses alongside the local school 
newspaper. Thus, while the in
tent of the law  to stifle under
age drinking  is not without 
merit, the execution is flawed.
Furthermore, in the case of The 
Pitt News, this intent doesnt even 
affect the majority of the campus 
community. According to the law
suit, 67.5 percent of Pitts 25,000 
students are 21 or older and are 
therefore legally allowed to drink. 
Because of this ratio, the law is 
doing more to hurt local busi
nesses and the papers advertis
ing revenues than to prevent un
derage drinking.
The Pitt News is right to take a 
stand against this law, and it is 
incumbent on the U.S. District 
Court to strike down the law as 
unconstitutional. Much more than 
lost advertising revenue is at 
stake  the law threatens the 
rights of college publications 
throughout Pennsylvania.

In her column Sui

flection [April 5], 
Rebecca Barkin asks, 
People call on him to
Film shoot disrupted 
campus life too much
At last, Paramount Pictures is 
donefilmingthe Wonder Boys movie 
at CMU. While the prospect of a 
film shoot on campus originally 
excited many students, the cast 
and crew for the movie had long 
overstayed their welcome. In addi
tion to being on campus far longer 
than originally announced, the film
ing interfered too much with daily 
campus life and even the long
standing tradition of Buggy.
At first, many students were 
excited about the film and the 
opportunity to see movie stars 
such as Michael Douglas, Robert 
Downey, and Katie Holmes. The 
administration thought having a 
film shoot here would provide good 
exposure for the University, and 
would also bring money, fame, 
and new students to CMU.
However, students have slowly 
lost their patience with the incon
venience the movie has created for 
them. When the film crew at the 
start ofthis semester, students were 
told that they would be wrapping 
tip over spring break. But when 
students came back from spring 
sreak, the crew was still here. 
Classes had to be relocated, the 
wheelchair ramp inside CFA was 
emoved, and the fake snow spread 
around by the crew detracted from 
;he appearance of the campus. 
Some students were late to classes 
n CFA and Margaret Morrison 
Decause filming was in progress at 
;he entrances to these buildings. 
The crew even displaced Peter 
steams, Dean of H&SS, for a day 
n order to meet its filming needs.
In addition, filming disrupted
Buggy practice sessions. Three 
days of freeroll practice, out of 
only 12 total planned, were can
celed due to the movie shoot, one 
because a film truck was unex
pectedly parked on the course. At 
these practice sessions, pushers 
train for the races during Carni
val, mechanics fine-tune buggies, 
and most importantly, drivers 
learn to navigate the course safely. 
According to the chair of the Sweep
stakes Committee, half of this 
semesters freeroll practices had 
to be canceled due to filming or 
bad weather, and as a result, some 
drivers were unable to complete 
their qualification requirements 
and may not be able to roll on race 
day. Allowing a film crew to have 
such an impact on an important 
tradition is unacceptable.
Paramount has agreed to pay 
extra money to the University for 
the inconveniences it has brought 
to the students. The administra
tion is considering dividing the 
money between CFA and H&SS, 
since they were inconvenienced 
the most. Another option is for 
the money to be placed into a fund 
which could, for example, be used 
for an event or maj or proj ect which 
would benefit all of CMU.
The novelty of having a movie 
shot on campus has worn off. 
Originally, students were excited 
to see movie stars on campus, but 
they need their parking spots and 
classrooms back. Next time, the 
administration should make sure 
that students and staffs needs 
have first priority before allowing 
shooting of a movie on campus.
Letter to 
the Editor
help them end their misery, and he does 
it. Can you argue with consent?
When discussing euthanasia, it is en
lightening to look to Hollands experi
ence with assisted suicide. In that coun
try, euthanasia remains illegal. How
ever, a court decision in 1981 estab-. 
lished a number of guidelines regarding 
euthanasia, and all but guarantees that 
doctors following those guidelines will 
not be prosecuted.
What has happened to the Dutch since 
this de facto legalization of euthanasia? 
The Remmelink report (September 10, 
1991) examines various statistics per
taining to assisted suicide in Holland. In 
1990, 2,700 people consensually passed 
away via some form of euthanasia or 
assisted suicide. In 1,040 cases, eutha
nasia was given without the patients 
consent. In an additional 4,941 cases, 
patients were killed via an overdose of 
pain medication  again, without their 
consent. The Remmelink report con
cludes that the majority of euthanasia 
.deaths in Holland are involuntary, per
formed without the consent of either the 
patient or their families. In almost all of 
these cases, the death certificate is falsi
fied by the doctor to avoid scrutiny 
by prosecutors.
Backlash by the Dutch people is strong: 
Many now carry in their wallets a card 
stating that no treatment be adminis
tered with the intention to end life. In a 
survey on health given to Dutch senior 
citizens, 10 percent expressed worries 
that their life would be prematurely 
terminated  even though the survey 
did not mention or allude to euthanasia 
in any way.
So to answer Ms. Barkins question, 
yes, one can argue with consent. Experi
ence has shown that there is a slippery 
slope between consensual euthanasia 
and murder. We should learn from 
Hollands experience, lest we be doomed 
to repeat it.

ECEGuns remain an urban necessity
Editor:
Perhaps the reason 
Yishan Wong [Gun 
control needs re-ex
amination in an ur
ban context, April 5]
Letter to 
the Editor
cant understand why anyone can take 
the NRA seriously anymore is because 
he lives in a bubble. First of all, I do not 
belong to the NRA, and I dont even own 
a gun as of the time of the writing of this 
response. Keep that in mind while you 
read this letter.
One of Yishans complaints in his ar
ticle is that that the NRA does not do
enough to defend citizens rights to bear 
non-gun arms such as nunchaku and 
rocket launchers. For example, he 
writes: Also, why arent they 
clamoring for the right to own rocket 
launchers and cruise missiles of their 
own? The answer is quite simple  it is 
hard enough defending the right to carry 
small, non-automatic firearms, without 
having to worry about rocket launchers, 
claymore mines, etc. Incidentally, 
why is Yishan so worried about the fact 
that the NRA does not defend the 
right to carry such weapons? Wouldnt 
hard-core liberals such as he be 
beating their chests even more loudly if 
they did?
Yishan states later in the article, Guns 
are a problem because of their presence 
 easy to get means easy to use. Well, 
it doesnt take a genius to figure out that 
kitchen knives, nunchaku, and Ryder 
trucks filled with high explosive are easy 
to obtain also.
Towards the end of the article, Yishan 
states, Thus lets completely ban guns 
in areas with a population density 
greater than that of the average sub
urb.... Well give our police the power to 
completely crack down on guns in areas 
with a greater population density than 
that of suburbs.... The modern-day city 
is a 20th century phenomenon; lets have 
new laws for new situations. So does he 
think that banning guns in urban areas, 
or anywhere else, for that matter, is a 
new idea? Adolf Hitler and Joe Stalin 
must be spinning in their graves.

Yugoslavia intervention raises moral issues
John Hursh
On March 24, NATO warplanes began 
systematically bombing Kosovo in an at
tempt to stop the human rights violations 
conducted against the Albanian people. 
These atrocities have been taking place 
under Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, 
the leader .of the Yugoslavian government.
Undoubtedly, there is much disagreement 
in public opinion as to whether the United 
States should be intervening in this conflict 
at all. There is also a great amount of contro
versy as to whether systematic bombings by 
the worlds most sophisticated warplanes is 
the way to stop the fighting and bring peace 
to the region. The general question of 
whether violence can ever truly bring peace 
deserves much scrutiny. There, is a definite 
distinction between peace and a forced in
terlude in fighting.
The American public is decidedly split on 
the decision to attack Kosovo. A poll in this 
weeks edition of Newsweek showed that 53

U.S.-China trade relations need dose of reality
Editors Notebook
by Ish Harshawat
Last Friday, President Clinton 
and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji 
met to discuss possible admittance 
of China into the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). The benefit 
for this to the United States would 
be to increase exports with China, 
reducing the current trade deficit 
of $57 billion, the second largest 
deficit the U.S. faces after Japan's. 
The talks failed to yield an agree
ment; however, after the Chinese 
make certain concessions, the 
country will probably be allowed 
into the WTO in the not-too-distant future.
Currently, U.S.-China relations 
are tense. Besides the large trade 
deficit, China has been accused of 
espionage regarding U.S. nuclear 
secrets, frequent human rights
violations, and illegal contributons 
to Clintons re-election campaign. 
Clinton, last Wednesday, defended 
his policy of engagement towards 
China, saying, [The U.S.] cannot 
allow a healthy argument 
to lead us toward a cam
paign-driven cold war with 
China, for that would have 
tragic consequences. In 
many ways, the argument 
is engagement versus iso
lation of China.
While Clinton is correct 
in statingthat isolation will 
only lead to trouble, he can
not, without screaming hy
pocrisy, give China the ben
efit of the doubt so easily.
The president feels that the 
U.S. should protect the 
rights of Kosovars in the 
Balkan region, but what 
about the rights of Tibetans 
who have already lost their 
political and cultural heri
tage to the Chinese? The U.S. 
should not turn its head to one 
form of oppression and ignore an
other. Clinton said that his admin
istration will work to promote a 
dialogue between China and the 
Dalai Lama and respect for Tibets 
cultural and religious heritage. 
However, what the U.S. should in
Sam Llnd/Tartan Art Staff
fact do is put pressure on China to 
not only improve relations with 
Tibet, but also stop pointing its 
nuclear arsenal towards Taiwan.
Speaking of weaponry, Iraq has 
been recently bombed by the U.S. 
for seeking to build an arsenal to 
defend its small nation. Though 
China continues to develop new 
nuclear technologies 
(some of which may be a 
direct result of stolen se
crets from U.S. laborato
ries), the U.S. seems to 
turn the other cheek.
Why make all these ex
ceptions for China, and even 
grant it most favored na
tion status? Simply stated, 
China sports the worlds 
largest population, and one 
of the most important 
economies in the global 
market. Look at electron
ics, shoes, clothes, car parts, 
and youll see that much of 
what consumers buy in the 
U.S. is made in China. To 
cut relations with China, or 
even have bad relations 
with the country, would spell ma
jor economic troubles for the U.S.
Therefore, it is not currently 
prudent to scream isolation like
labor unions seem to be promot
ing with their stance against 
Chinas admittance into the WTO, 
or completely refus China being 
allowed into the WTO based on its 
abuses of power, which the Re
publicans favor. This, as Clinton 
states, would send a message to 
China that it should in fact be our 
enemy. However, the U.S. should 
not continue to take a weak stance 
on these abuses simply based on 
Chinas size and economic poten
tial. Clinton cannot euphemize the 
U.S.-Chinese tension by calling it 
a healthy argument. China 
should be admitted into the WTO 
based mostly on U.S. terms, to 
take an active measure to at least 
fix the trade deficit. However, in 
addition, if the Clinton adminis
tration does not take a firm stance 
on the Asian giants abuses now, 
violations of human rights and 
nuclear build-up could spur on a 
major conflict in the future.

Kosovo conflict betrays plans of vile alien menace
Theres no reason for us to be in Yugo
slavia.
Oh, Im sure youve heard the argu
ment: Its not our business. Were making 
things worse. We shouldnt be interfering. 
Were bullies of the world. We dont want 
our troops getting killed in someone elses 
war. It might make Russia get involved 
and start another world war.
Sure. No, theres really no reason at all 
for us to be there.
The ostensible reason given in press 
releases is that were there for humani
tarian reasons. Oh, please. You mean the 
same humanitarian reasons we blockade 
Cuba and Iraq to starve their people 
because we dont like their leaders? The 
same reasons we supported Pinochets 
brutal regime in Chile that resulted in the 
deaths of over 50,000 civilians, or when 
we bombed the life out of Vietnam with 
chemical weapons, leaving behind a
scarred population which has regular birth 
defects to this day? Or maybe you refer to 
the humanitarian envoy sent by President 
Bush to China after the Tianenmen Square 
massacre, to reassure China of continued 
U.S. friendship. The government has al
ways coddled countries with less-then-stellar human rights records if its in our busi
ness interests to do so. Its safe to say were 
not in Yugoslavia to defend anyones hu
man rights.
During the Gulf War, we could claim eco
nomic interest because of the oil. With the 
amount of gasoline consumed in this coun
try and the political and business clout 
wielded by the Big Three automakers, it 
was safe to say that economic interests 
focused our attention on maintaining con
trol in the Gulf. Likewise, positive relations 
with China since the time of Nixon can be 
largely attributed to business factors  
China has the worlds largest consumer 
market, and our corporations want access. 
But theres nothing of economic importance 
in Yugoslavia at all. So theres really no 
reason whatsoever for us to be in Yugosla
via. No human reason, that is.
We are in Yugoslavia, being completely 
militarily incompetent (we all know cruise 
missiles can fly into specific windows, so
why are we even hitting civilian towns? 
We are not misfiring; we are hitting them 
on purpose!) to serve the aims of our soonto-be alien overlords.
Aliens have infiltrated the top levels of 
governments worldwide. Having subju
gated our leaders, they must destroy us 
militarily before moving in. Even if our 
zombified leaders (do you think A1 Gore 
acts like a human?) welcome our new mas
ters, individual elements of our military 
will fight back. So they must find a way to 
disable our military capability.
That is why they have maneuvered the 
U.S. military response in Kosovo. For 
years, we paid virtually no attention to the 
strife in Yugoslavia. Now, motivated by 
alien control, our military is in there, blun
dering around like idiots, indiscriminately 
killing the civilian population and escalat
ing the conflict. At the same time, Russian 
resentment against what they see as 
American imperialism grows, and many 
Russians feel that the events in Yugosla
via are only practice for a war with Russia. 
Serbians are publicly calling for help from 
Russia. Make no mistake  we are in 
Yugoslavia precisely to start a big war.
With NATO behind the U.S., and China 
and much of the rest of the Americanleery world behind Russia, the coming 
war will be surely deplete our collective 
armies, and the limited theater will 
guarantee relatively low civilian casu
alties. When the war is over, loathsome 
alien hordes will descend upon our 
battle-wearied people, and, meeting 
little resistance, quickly enslave the 
civilian population.
We must not allow this to happen! We 
must withdraw our troops from Yugo
slavia at once and conserve our resources! 
We must stand united in the face of the 
coming invasion!
But you ask, what can I do? Spread the 
word! Sign up to work on special weap
ons research projects! Petition the 
adminstration to convert the construc
tion of the Purnell Center into a gigantic 
space cannon. When they find that 
their plan to exhaust our military has 
failed, the aliens will most certainly 
lay siege to our planet. We shall need 
many such space cannons to break 
the siege and fly onward to the stars! 
To freedom! Freedom!

Columnist questions our 'moral duty to send forces to Balkans
I93fRs PScb 2uCl J
stance in this conflict is the posi
tion of NATO. Traditionally, 
NATO has been defensive to
wards hostile governments. Now 
it finds itself forcing the offense 
of the conflict.
This brings me to the larger 
moral question concerning our 
involvement of this conflict. 
Should America be involved in 
military action in Kosovo? I do 
not question whether America 
should be involved in Kosovo on 
the traditional arguments either 
for or against military involve
ment. In the past, such situa
tions have included proximity to 
the fighting, the spread of hostile 
ideals, such as the Domino Theory 
in Vietnam, the elected 
presidents foreign policy at the
time, and even our countrys need 
for natural resources.
I disregard all of this. I wonder 
whether Americans should feel 
compelled to enter the conflict 
because, as members of a power
ful and wealthy nation, we could 
help stop the suffering of the eth
nic Albanian people. Reports have 
shown us the horrific exploits of 
the Serbian army against the Al
banians. These actions include 
Albanians being used as human 
shields, going on forced marches, 
genocide, systematic executions, 
destruction of homes, and deprav
ity of all sorts.
It almost seems intuitive that 
if Ihave the ability to help some
one I should. If I happen to be 
walking down Forbes Avenue and 
a stranger asks me for directions
to CMU, it seems that I should 
give him or her the necessary 
directions. I can obviously help 
this stranger. Although I am un
der no legal obligation or moral 
duty to help this stranger, I can 
see no reason why I shouldnt.
There are obvious limitations 
to this type of thinking, and I am 
not sure if it is possible to apply 
this obvious and perhaps overly 
simplistic model to anything as 
maddening and chaotic as war. 
There are other objections to this 
line of thought as well. Many 
people give no thought to the suf
fering of others, as long as it does 
not affect them. It is also difficult 
to convince people to take moral 
action when violence is involved. 
Without question, violence is a 
poor solution to anything  in
deed, it is hardly a solution at 
all. However, in a situation as 
bleak as this, when human 
right violations persist despite 
a great deal of diplomacy, we 
must ask ourselves whether, 
intervention can be justified.
Despite the problems with 
applying such a simple postu
late to an extremely complex 
situation, the problem of what 
exactly is at stake must also be 
given thought. Referring back 
to my example of giving direc
tion to a stranger, imagine that 
I refuse to give directions to 
this man. Perhaps I am even 
rude to him. What is the worst 
thing that can happen to him? 
He could think that Pittsburgh 
residents are rude. It may take 
him a long time to find the
university, and he might be late for 
a meeting. If we really extend the 
circumstances, perhaps he is late 
for a job interview and consequently 
doesnt get hired. Because of this, he 
cant afford to have dinner tonight.
Big deal. This is nothing compared 
to what happens if the U.S. govern
ment does not stop the forces of 
Milosevic from their ethnic cleansing 
of the Albanian people in Kosovo. The 
difference in scale between missing 
a meal and people dying is too 
absurd even to discuss. Although the 
cost of the United States Armed Forces 
taking action is a considerable one, 
and it will cause people to die, it 
may very well be the best of a set of 
bad options.

Taking a closer look at the rea
sons for taking Rodman, all this 
should come as no surprise. Sure, 
he has won five championships, 
but he wasnt the main reason for 
any of those. In Detroit, where he 
picked up his first two rings, he 
was a largely unknown role player 
who provided hustle and defense 
in the shadow of players such as 
Bill Lambier, Isaiah Thomas, Joe 
Dumars, and Vinnie Johnson. In 
Chicago, Michael and Scottie defi
nitely showed the way. In other 
words, Rodman has never been a 
steadying influence, but rather 
needs such an influence himself. 
In the two situations where he 
has had strong personalities 
around him, he has won. Chuck

Pittsburgh, PA, USA
For many technologies in many contexts of 
use, the limiting factor for success is the 
interaction between the user and the system. 
The computer-human interaction is, literally, 
the limit
Come to CHI 99 and help us push those 
limits to heights that have never been 
reached before. Your attendance will help us 
to solve some of the burning issues.
The annual CHI conference is the premier 
worldwide forum for exchanging information 
on all aspects of how people interact with 
computers and with each other. Researchers, 
practitioners, educators, and students from 
around the world join in exploring and pushing the limits of computer-human interac
tion.

Bu gypp revi
One week out of a six-month season is 
by no means a good indicator of events to 
come, but there has already been plenty 
of action for baseball fans to get excited 
about in the young major league season.
Having had some time to adjust to 
their new surroundings, many of 
; the big-name free agents that 
switched teams during the off
season are already making quite 
an impact. Though a late come
back by the Oakland Athletics 
held Roger Clemens to a no-deci
sion in his first start as a Yankee, 
the Rocket has already made his 
presence felt. Pitching his first 
game in Yankee Stadium in the 
! home colors, Clemens struck out 
! eight over seven and two-thirds 
innings in a shutout of Detroit. 
Though they most likely will not 
be as dominant as last season, 
the Yankees have won three 
straight since losing their opener 
and are starting to once again 
look like the most invincible force 
in the league.
Mo Vaughn, the California An
gels new acquisition, has also 
made his presence (or lack of it) 
felt in Anaheim. In the top of the 
! first inning of the Angels season 
opener against the Cleveland In
dians, Vaughn fell into the visi. tors dugout chasing a foul ball. 
Vaughn stayed in the game 
through his first at bat, but was 
clearly in a great deal of pain and 
could not continue. Vaughn is 
currently listed as day-to-day 
with a sprained ankle meaning there is 
no definite prediction for when he might 
return, but the Angels are praying for 
sooner rather than later. Without 
rVaughns bat in the lineup, the Angels 
lost the final two games of the series by 
matching 9-1 scores and should con
tinue to struggle until hes back.
Speaking of the Indians, the Tribe has 
served notice that it was less than thrilled 
with last seasons loss to the Yankees in 
the American League Championship 
Series and is looking-for revenge. After 
the bullpen allowed the Angels to come 
from behind and win the first game of 
the series, the Indians suddenly shifted
pitchers Bartolo Colon and Dave Burba 
combined for 10 strikeouts and just one 
earned run in 11 innings of work. The 
offensive explosion continued into the 
next series as Charles Nagy reaped the 
benefits in a 14-5 win over the Minne
sota Twins. Surprisingly, most of the 
Indians production has come from lighthitting shortstop Omar Vizquel, who 
1 was second on the team in runs batted in 
through Saturday with seven.
Most of the other teams in the league 
have begun the season as expected, with 
the exception of the Boston Red Sox and 
San Francisco Giants. Predicted to hang 
close for a while, then fall short of their 
more talented division rivals, the Red 
Sox and Giants both sprinted from the
this point, disappointing the fans derebound from what seemed to be a total 
spite their solid play in all other areas, loss of control over the ball and regain 
Meanwhile, the list of star players his status as the go-to-guy in the Braves 
missing time continues to grow. Along bullpen. Six walks and two earned runs
with Vaughn, Seattle Mariners short
stop Alex Rodriguez will miss four to six 
weeks after undergoing arthroscopic 
knee surgery, and New York Mets 
catcher Mike Piazza will be out two to 
three weeks with a sprained knee. Even 
the Iron Man, Cal Ripken Jr., has al
ready missed two games due to soreness 
in his back. Ripkens decision to end The 
Streak at the end of last season now 
seems even more important.
Theres still plenty of baseball left to 
play this season, but so far, there have 
been hints that the disparity between
gears. In the two wins over California,
gate to the best records in the league 
through Sunday. San Francisco opened 
the season 5-0 for the first time since 
1987 before finally losing to the San 
Diego Padres on Saturday, while the 
Red Sox stood as the only remaining 
undefeated team heading into Sundays 
action at 5-0.
As far as individual performances go, 
the big names in the news have been 
there mostly for their lack of productiv
ity. After jump-starting the new edition 
of the home run chase with a blast in his 
first game, Mark McGwire has joined 
Sammy Sosa in the realm of us mere 
mortals. Neither member of the 61-plus 
homer club is even leading their team at
later, after two appearances that to
taled two-thirds of an inning, Wohlers 
was sent down to the minors. The Braves 
need help in the bullpen, but couldnt 
afford to take chances on Wohlers any
more. Now theyll play the waiting game 
to see if he can pull it together after some 
time in AAA ball.
Finally, theres the issue that no one 
seems to want to talk about, but could 
prove to be the most pivotal chain of 
events in the season: the umpires. The 
umpires current contract with the league 
expires after this season, and unless 
major changes take 
place between now and 
November, there is al
most no chance that 
the 2000 season will 
begin with the regular 
umpires on the field. 
Major league umpires 
have been in the news 
more and more fre
quently lately due to 
confrontations with 
the players  Roberto 
Alomar and John 
Hirschbeck, for ex

The Basketball Beat
by Pete Patterson
The Los Angeles Lakers rea
sons for signing Dennis Rodman 
earlier in the season raised doubt 
in the minds of many fans. The 
first, most obvious reason for sign
ing the most famous role player 
in the history of the game was no 
doubt legitimate. Elden Campbell 
was j ust too inconsistent of a pres
ence on the boards, and signing 
the perennial rebound champ 
would no doubt help to shore up 
that area and take pressure off of 
Shaquille ONeal.
The other rea
sons floated for 
signing the 
multi-hued one 
were more contro
versial. Rodman has been part of 
five championship teams, and the 
Lakers figured he could be the 
missing link in their champion
ship hopes by showing their 
young players how to win 
over the long haul. A 
main criticism of the 
Lakers is that they 
are a collection of su
perstars rather than 
a team, and the feel
ing was that Rodman would be a 
great boon on the floor  hus
tling, setting picks, and getting 
into the heads of the opposition. 
In these two ways, Rod
man could serve as a 
steadying influence 
to the teams 
young, talented 
players.
The grouping of 
the words steady
ing influence and 
Rodman should 
have sent off loud 
warning Signals, but 
in this strange NBA 
season, anything 
could happen. The sea
son is only 
50 games long due to 
the 
lock
out
An AllStar game? 
Another casu
alty of the off-sea
son work stoppage. 
The Chicago Bulls 
have been decimated, with 
the survivors from that dy
nasty landing everywhere. Scottie Pippen is with the Rockets, 
Steve Kerr and Luc Longley are 
with the Spurs. The Bulls are in 
last place, with Michael Jordan 
playing a lot of golf and thinking 
about buying the Hornets, and
Phil Jackson is no doubt meditat
ing over coaching offers some
where. And, for a couple of 
weeks, it appeared 
that Rodman would 
be everything the 
Lakers hoped he 
would. The team 
went from a strug
gling 6-6 squad with 
a lot of talent to one on 
fire with 10 straight 
wins. Rodman was on his 
best behavior, with no 
problems to note except for 
being late for one practice 
because of traffic.
However, since that point 
the Lakers have gone 9-7, and 
Rodman has been Rodman. On 
the court, Rodman has been 
mostly productive, except for the 
occasional technical fouls, one of 
which cost his team a game. His 
rebounding and defense arent 
quite what they used to be, but he 
does a great job for a 37-year-old. 
Off the court, though, he has been 
nothing but a distraction. The 
steadying influence the Lakers 
hoped to gain has definitely back
fired, with Rodman taking an un
announced leave of absence to 
take care of personal problems, 
which turned out to be a need to 
unload some cash in the Las Ve
gas casinos. Lately, the news of 
his on-again, off-again marriage 
to Carmen Electra has dominated 
the headlines. Not exactly the 
formula the Lakers hope for their 
young players, Shaq and Kobe, 
to follow.

Tartan Special Projects Manager

hit Pittsburgh last Friday afternoon, 
the mens and womens track and field 
team competed in their second meet of 
the outdoor season on Saturday, April 
10. The Tartans took their game on the 
road for the first time in 1999 and com
peted in the Indiana (PA) Invitational.
The competition was very good, said 
head outdoor track coach Dario
Tartan file photo
Increased practice time should benefit the Tartan weight teams 
as they prepare for the UAA champoinships on April 23-25.
Donatelli. Of the 10 schools in atten
dance, half were NCAA Division II and 
the rest, including Carnegie Mellon, were 
all from Division III. Things were espe
cially tough on the field side of things .... 
The Division II schools had a number of 
good throwers, Donatelli said.
Many of the Tartan runners rose to 
the challenge of stiff competition, 
however, refusing to be intimidated by 
teams from the larger colleges. Senior 
distance runner Margaret Powers domi
nated two events, finishing on top in the 
1500-meter and 
3000-meter runs. 
With a time of 
10:20 in the 3000- 
meter, Powers 
also seta new sta
dium record.
Not to be out
done, senior 
Maureen 
McGranaghan 
and junior An
drea Byrnes also 
finished strongly 
in the 3000- 
meter, placing 
fourth and fifth, 
respectively.
First-year stu
dent Alina Mason 
placed fifth in the 
400-meter, sec
ond among Divi
sion III runners. 
I think that at 
this point Im 
where Id like to 
be personally,
said Mason. The team as a whole is 
doing great and a lot of people are work
ing really hard.
On the mens side of things, senior 
Kristo Kreichbaum placed third in the 
5000-meter event, while first-year Matt 
Dennerline finished fifth. The 3000- 
meter steeplechase also saw a number of 
solid Tartan finishes, with freshman 
Eric Egenolf and senior Kelan Wieloch 
finishing third and first respectively. 
Finally, first-year Brian Knudson placed 
fourth in the 800-meter event.
Despite the strong individual show
ings, the team has not had a chance 
to gauge where they stand as a team, 
as neither last weeks invitational nor 
the CMU Invitational on April 2 kept 
team scores. This Wednesday, however, 
the Tartans will compete in their first 
team meet of the year as they host 
Grove City, Bethany, and Allegheny in 
Gesling Stadium.
So far weve run in invitationals and 
individual events, said Donatelli. This 
Wednesday will give us an opportunity 
to runhead to head against other teams. 
He said that it should be the teams 
best opportunity yet to prepare for the 
University Athletic Association Cham
pionships  the ultimate goal for the 
teams season.
I think that the team scoring encour
ages a group-effort ethic, said Mason. 
If you dont feel like running or some
thing on a particular day, you will still 
go the extra mile for the team. You may 
also do better individually because of it.
Overall, Donatelli is impressed with 
the teams performance. Weve already 
progressed well ahead of where we were
during the indoor 
season. Right 
now, results are a 
little sketchy as to 
how the other 
UAA schools are 
performing, so its 
hard to see 
how we stack up 
against them, 
he said.
Over the next 
few weeks, the 
team will continue 
to focus on the 
UAA Champion
ships, competing 
in the University 
of Pittsburgh In
vitational this 
weekend in addi
tion to the team 
meet at home on 
Wednesday be
fore traveling to 
Rochester on April 
24-25 for the 
Championships. 
The timing of the 
UAA meet poses 
its own problems 
for the CMU 
teams. Fully half 
of the teams dual 
meet schedule
The Tartan distance runners have been among the teams most 
consistent performers throughout the outdoor season.
takes place after the UAA meet, drasti
cally decreasing the time available for 
getting into peak condition for the most 
important meet of the season.
Were only two weeks into the season 
and its a little too early to talk
specifics, but this Wednesday should 
be a great chance to see where we are, 
said Donatelli.

The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Carnival focuses | 
on kids' classics
By GREG NOFI
Tartan Contributing Edi
tor
Have confusing algo
rithms and tedious essays 
given you nothing but eye 
strain recently? No need to 
worry, because at carnival 
this weekend, youll get to 
put your textbooks away 
and jump back in time to 
visit some tales from your 
youth. This years theme is 
Childrens Books: Where 
your childhood dreams 
come alive!
[Carnival is] coming 
together as a community 
to create a fun event for 
the entire community, 
whether its through 
Buggy, Booth, or just com
ing and enjoying the 
atmosphere, said Susan 
Swithenbank, a junior 
mechanical engineering 
major and chair of the Car
nival Power and Safety 
Committee.
It all begins this Thurs
day with the Opening Cer
emonies at the Midway 
entrance located in the 
Morewood parking lot. Fol
lowing a performance by 
the CMU bagpipers, the 
Midway will officially open 
for the three-day affair.
The Midway will feature 
entertainment, rides, con
cessions, and booths. The 
various musical and come
dy acts will take place on 
the large main stage and 
the smaller midway stage. 
Across from the stages, 
both adults and children 
can take part in the 11 
rides available.
Fraternities, sororities, 
and several other student 
organizations have been 
working during the last 
few weeks to put together 
their entries for the booth 
competition, which is the 
major attraction on the 
Midway. In addition to the 
27 booths this year, there 
will also be seven blitz 
booths entered by student 
groups that do not have the 
resources to create a regu
lar-sized booth. This non
competitive option focuses 
less on the actual construc
tion and more on the game. 
All of the booths are

Booths give life to stories
ByASEEM S. GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
 After a thunderstorm-filled morning 
and afternoon, the clouds finally part
ed over the Emerald City, from The 
Wizard of Oz, as it made its way down 
Forbes Avenue carried by approxi
mately 30 fraternity brothers from Phi 
Kappa Theta (Phi Kap). People 
stopped and gazed, and for many, this 
large green shell in the middle of 
Forbes Avenue made them realize that 
Carnival was on its way to CMU.
This year there will be 26 booths on 
the Midway, centered around the 
theme of childrens books. For kids, 
[childrens books] are something that 
they are familiar with, said Margaret 
Wang, Carnival Committee chair and 
a senior in electrical and computer 
engineering (ECE). For older people, 
they can remember their childhood. 
The theme is chosen by a committee
made up of the Carnival Committee 
and the Booth chairs in the 
fall semester.
Various organizations, including 
dorms, fraternities, sororities, and stu
dent clubs, all build booths for Carni
val. Booths can take a lot of time and 
effort to build, and some groups start 
weeks before Carnival. Each booth 
has a game that adheres to their 
theme that [in turn] adheres to the 
general theme [of Carnival], said 
Wang. They are spectacular struc
tures. The games are geared towards 
children, but both children and adults 
can partake in the booth games.
Phi Kap, for example, chose The Wiz
ard of Oz for their theme. We chose it 
because we thought it would give us 
the most range of things we could do 
structurally, said Jon Beerhalter, the 
Phi Kap booth chair and a senior ECE 
major. [The object of the game] is you

Director earns high-school coaching honors
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
When people think intramural sports, 
they think of IM director Mike Mastroianni. Little do they know that, he 
also coached a very successful boysbas
ketball team this past season. He 
recently was awarded Western Pennsyl
vania Interscholastic Athletic Leagues 
Boys Basketball Coach of the Year by 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for leading 
the Quakers of Quaker Valley High 
School in Sewickley, Pennsylvania to 
the state championship for the first time 
in the schools history.
The Tartan caught up with Mastroianni to discuss his successful season 
with the Quakers and his views about 
IM sports at CMU.
The Tartan: What does this award 
mean to you?
Mike Mastroianni: Its a tremendous 
honor. I think its a tribute to the work 
ethic that my players have given over 
the last year, and obviously Ive been 
fortunate that Ive had an excellent 
group of athletes to work with.
TT: How do you feel about sports at 
the high school level?
MM: I think sports at the high school 
level are a great teaching tool. They 
teach about lifetime experiences. Ive 
always said that I want to win as bad 
as the guy beside me. But if you judge
IM Sports Mike Mastroianni won an award for his dedication to a local team.
coaching at the high school level on just 
wins and losses, then that is when I 
will stop coaching. To me its an exten
sion of the classroom  its an addi
tional period. Youre learning team
work, highs and lows, and things you 
have to experience the rest of your life.
TT: What plans do you have for the 
Quakers next season?
MM: Well have the same approach 
that weve had every year. You evaluate 
your team and try to play to your
strengths, and thats the fun thing 
about coaching, especially at the high 
school level. You have to work with new 
players every year. You do so much 
teaching; I really enjoy the teaching 
part of it. Because you get to the state 
championship game doesnt guarantee 
that youre back there next year. We 
have a lot of young kids that need 
work, and its part of the coaching end 
that I really enjoy.
TT: Where do you feel IM sports at
CMU stand right now?
MM: I feel weve built our intramural 
program up to be equal to any school of 
our caliber, and even better than some 
bigger schools. Intramurals play a very 
important part, especially at a school 
like Carnegie Mellon. Its a great 
release, its a great way to interact with 
other students on campus, and with the 
academic workload here at Carnegie 
Mellon, its just a valuable asset to 
our campus.
TT: What IM sports do you feel are 
most popular at CMU?
MM: We have a wide range of activi
ties. We offer almost anything that the 
students would recommend.
I think that people associate intra
murals basically as being the team 
sports: football, basketball, softball, 
soccer, floor hockey. But were much 
more than that we have over 40 
activities, and a lot of intramural pro
grams in the country dont do that.
We offer table tennis, we offer 
pinochle, we offer darts, we offer things 
that get the student involved in doing 
something they have an interest in, 
and get them out and communicating 
with different students.
We have participation in all of them. 
The numbers arent as important  if 
we have two people who want to do one 
thing, and its important to those 
two students, then we need to run 
it correctly.
Art show gazes back at viewers in opening

Peter Cramer's art show made viewers feel as if they were being watched.
Friday at the opening of Peter 
Cramers art exhibit in the GSIA 
gallery. I feel like the art is 
studying me.
Peter Cramer, a doctoral student in 
rhetoric at CMU, held a reception on 
April 9 to present two series of paint
ings, one entitled Somewhere, and 
the other, Someone. They will be on 
display in Posner Hall until May 16.
underpasses, and lonely streetlamps 
glowing gold on dark corners are 
labeled with lowercase letters.
In an explanation accompanying his 
work, Cramer wrote that Somewhere 
was inspired by an article entitled 
Americanism and Localism, written 
by John Dewey and published in The 
Dial in 1920. Cramer discovered the 
article when doing research  excerpts
from it accompany Cramers paintings.
Someone, the series on the opposite 
wall, was inspired by a group of pho
tographs Cramers brother found while 
working at a small newspaper in the 
southern United States. They had orig
inally been used in a special section 
announcing job promotions by 
local companies, but had gone 
unclaimed after the announcements 
were published.
The anonymity was interesting to 
me, said Cramer of the photos. Por
traits are usually done for people with 
a lot of money or a lot of fame. I like 
the idea of portraits for regular peo
ple, and I liked the idea of painting 
portraits of people I didnt know. 
Cramers portraits in Someone, like 
the roadways in Somewhere, are 
labeled with characters rather than 
being titled, and are described 
as anonymous.
They are accompanied by a passage 
from Sherwood Andersons Winesberg, 
Ohio. Most are done in just a few col
ors, many of the faces in intense 
oranges, reds, and yellows. [Cramers 
work] has a very Impressionistic look, 
but the color is entirely different than 
Impressionistic paintings. [Cramers] 
color is much more aggressive, almost 
surreal, said Matt Downing, a 
third-year graduate in student in 
industrial administration.
Before coming to CMU, Cramer stud
ied at Miami University and the Min
neapolis College of Art and Design. He 
said his apprenticeship with Martin
Ahrens was very influential in his 
career. In addition to painting, Cramer 
has worked in the areas of printmaking, illustration, logo design, sign 
painting, and faux finishing. He began 
his study of rhetoric out of a desire to 
learn an entirely new craft; however, 
he has discovered that a connection 
does exist between the rhetoric 
and painting.
Ive been a painter longer than Ive 
been a rhetorician, said Cramer. But 
I feel my experience with rhetoric has 
really enriched painting. Both Some
where and Someone were influenced, 
at least partially, by writings from out
side the art world.I just enjoy the 
process of painting. Its not something I 
do to communicate something to some
one, said Cramer. On the other hand, 
its impossible to make a text or image 
without having some idea of who your 
audience will be.
Cramer said the idea behind Some
where and Someone was to present 
interesting problems. Are we really 
anonymous? Cramer said his work is 
asking. Is it possible to be anonymous? 
And, if so, what does it mean to 
be anonymous?
Peter Cramers exhibit Somewhere. 
Someone. will be on display in the 
GSIA Gallery until May 16. The 
Gallery is located in Posner Hall and is 
open from 8 am to 10 pm Monday 
through Friday, and from 9 am to 10 
pm on Saturday and Sunday. For more

Wearable computers assist Marines, civilians
ByASEEM S. GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
If you think a new Palm Pilot 
is the latest and greatest thing 
to have in the palm of your 
hand, youll want to reconsider 
after taking a look at the wear
able and portable computers 
under development at CMU. 
After five minutes with one of 
the prototypes, you may begin 
to think that the new Palm 
Pilot in your backpack would be 
better off in the garage right 
next to your old Mac II ci.
Dan Siewiorek, director of 
the Human Computer Interac
tion Institute, presented a lec
ture last week in which he 
highlighted and explained 
CMUs involvement in wear
able and palm-sized computers, 
one of the fastestgrowing sec
tors of the computer hardware 
industry. CMU has developed 
16 generations of wearable 
computers, and Siewiorek gave 
his audience an opportunity to 
experience and understand 
the technology by letting 
them wear and use some of 
the devices.
Starting from an elementary 
description of what a wearable 
computer is, Siewiorek outlined
the evolution of computers from 
the early engines of the indus
trial age to the tiny hand-held 
computers of today.
By using examples of both 
military and civilian applica
tions, he highlighted the impor
tance of wearable computers in 
providing accurate and timely 
data where and when it is 
most needed.
[We are] trying to provide 
the right information and the 
right data at the right time, 
said Siewiorek.
One of the devices that 
Siewiorek brought to his pre
sentation was a wearable com
puter used by the Marines as a 
maintenance aid for large 
ground-based combat units. 
The device, which weighs about 
two pounds, is enclosed in a 
sturdy protective case and 
attaches to the waist. Connect
ed to the device is a headmounted display system that 
displays the data screen to the 
user. Siewiorek said that the 
system contained over 600 
inspections and was controlled 
by a simple button and scrollknob system.
A lot of these things 
are designed by students, 
said Siewiorek. Previously,
[the maintenance records] were 
available only in heavy instruc
tion manuals.
CMU students designed a 
system for the military that 
essentially computerized a 
process that involved manually 
taking maintenance notes for 
the 600 areas of the unit and 
then typing them into a com
puter that would transmit the 
data to another computer. 
The result, according to 
Siewiorek, is a system that 
saves time, reduces error, and 
increases efficiency.
The military sector is not the 
only area where wearable com
puters are in demand, accord
ing to Siewiorek. He explained 
that civilian uses were plenti
ful, and that CMU students 
have been involved in extensive 
work to bring many communi
cations devices into one seam
less product.
People can be placed in haz
ardous situations because the 
technology is not wellmatched, said Siewiorek.
One of the devices that elicit
ed the most response from the 
audience was a palm-sized 
device running at 200 mega
hertz  about the speed of a 
laptop computer. Siewiorek
said that the device, called 
Itsy, shared many of the same 
features of a laptop, but includ
ed more advanced features 
such as voice recognition and 
language translation. There 
are currently only 60 of the 
$3,000 Itsys in existence, that 
spend their time travelling the 
world, but Siewiorek said he 
expects for the device to go into 
mass production within the 
space of a few years.
At the end of the lecture, sev
eral students asked questions 
and offered their own com
ments about the wearable com
puters and the course in which 
such devices are developed. 
The technology looks really 
promising, said Nathan Los, a 
sophomore computer science 
major. I see a lot of applica
tions in industry in the next 
few years as [wearable comput
ers] get more advanced.
Siewiorek closed his lecture  
by showing a recent video 
about what one computer man^ 
ufacturer expected the state-pf 
computing to be in five years. 
He said that some of the gadf 
gets shown in the film were 
already on the shelves of the I 
local computer store, years 
ahead of schedule, and ; re; * 
emphasized the growing impor
tance of smaller and more 
portable wearable computers.

Armed with books waiting to masse last Friday for the lecbe signed and a plethora of ture by Douglas Adams, author
of the famed Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy series.
Greeted by a very extended 
ovation, Adams began by 
telling the story of his first trip

to Pittsburgh, which was 
necessitated by a missed high
way exit on the way to New 
York. Then he announced his 
decision not to give the lecture 
shat had been billed for the 
evening  Living in the Virtu
al World.
I normally give this lecture 
bo businesses, and find that it 
doesnt usually go over well 
with students because, well, 
they know it all already, 
hie said.
Instead, Adams proceeded 
into a two-hour storytelling 
session. He said he would 
end the introduction with 
the opening story from the lec
ture he would have given, 
but then followed with a 
series of side stories and notes 
so long that by the time he 
declared the introductory peri
od over, a full half-hour 
had passed.
Throughout the rest of the 
lecture, Adams went through 
a series of stories that could 
have come straight from his 
books. His focus of attention 
shifted as often as his position 
on stage, as he paced back and 
forth with total disregard for 
the podium set up center stage.
The stories themselves were 
filled with one-liners, such as 
traipsing through the rain for
est in what can only be 
described as rain.
Despite the fragmented 
nature of the stories, there 
were two main themes Adams 
addressed quite clearly  his 
process for coming up with 
creative ideas and his adven
tures searching for endangered 
animals. Most ideas dont 
come from real life because 
real events dont happen 
with neat beginnings, middles, 
and ends, he said. To reinforce 
the point, he followed 
with two of his real-life experi
ences that started as exciting 
stories but fizzled to anti-climactic finishes.
At this point, Adams asked 
for a vote on where the session 
should go from there. Propos
ing the two alternatives of ani
mal stories or readings from 
Hitchhikers Guide to the 
Galaxy, Adams was met with a 
chorus of Both!
Thus inspired, Adams 
detailed some of his travels to 
exotic locales and his findings 
that humans really arent that 
different from the other inhabi
tants of the planet. Reducing it 
to simplest terms, Adams 
summed up humans as mom 
keys with an obsession witti 
twigs. Going through the comr 
parisons of humans to what we 
view as less advanced crealtures, Adams concluded by sayr 
ing that the most unifying entir 
ty on Earth is extinction. -; *
Humans are the only species 
that has the ability to face the 
possibility of their own extincl 
tion and quite possibly avoicl 
it, he said.
With that point made, Adams 
opened the floor for a question 
and-answer session. Most ques. 
tions dealt with the upcoming 
Hitchhiker's movie (tentatively 
scheduled for release sometime 
in the year 2000) and the busii 
ness Adams co-founded, ane  
were answered with another, 
series of stories that led into sc 
many offshoots that Adams 
once forgot the question he was 
supposed to be answering.
Adams concluded the session 
with a reading from the Hitch 
hiker's series. Stating hi? 
long-held desire to be aif 
actor, Adams exaggerated^ 
acted out the roles in th< 
selected passage. 
Organizations work to finish booths on Carnival IVI id way

have to guide Dorothy through the 
story of Oz. According to Beerhalter, 
the fraternity members have put thou
sands of man-hours into their booth.
Alpha Epsilon Pis theme is The Lit
tle Engine That Could, and their booth 
is in the form of a train. We thought
there was a lot of potential for this 
story, said Harry Heymann, the booth 
chair and a junior in ECE. Mike Turn
er, the booths architect, said he is par
ticularly excited by the shape of the 
booth, which relies on a cylindrical 
structure for the body of the train. 
Heymann said that about 500 manBooth builders worked on their structures last Saturday on the Carnival Midway.
hours had been invested in the booth 
by last Friday, and that he expected at 
least another thousand would be nec
essary to complete the project.
According to Wang, much prepara
tion and hard work go into booth build
ing. The Booth Committee met bi
weekly during the fall semester and 
then weekly during the spring semes
ter leading up to Carnival. There are 
many considerations that booth 
builders must take into consideration 
including structural safety, electrical 
safety, and environmental soundness. 
Because of the strict guidelines and 
competitive nature of Carnival booths, 
the Carnival Committee introduced 
blitz booths last year.We had fewer 
booths  we were trying to devise a 
way to fill up the Midway, said Wang.
Blitz booths allow organizations 
that have never built a booth before to 
build simplified structures that are 
non-competitive. They are half-size 
booths that, according to Wang, focus 
primarily on the game rather than the 
external and internal appearance. 
[This] is a good opportunity for orga
nizations that dont have the manpow
er or financial backing [necessary to 
build a full-size booth], said Wang. 
All booths have been pretty popular, 
said Wang.
Theyre all well-built and are pretty 
attractive. Theyre a lot of fun to build 
and there is so much tradition and his
tory. The booths will be open on the 
Midway shortly after 5 pm on Thurs
day, closing at 11 pm. Booths will be 
open from 11 am-llpm Friday and 
Saturday.

dents would rather wear costumes for 
Halloween instead of roll. This semes
ter is the exact opposite, with a total 
count that has some organizations 
even calling for the cancellation of 
Sweepstakes altogether. But enough 
of the weather, let me talk about my 
predictions.
Organizations not listed in the top 
ten or top three are not there for a vari
ety of reasons. For example, DTD just 
came out two weeks ago, and organiza
tions like Sig Tau and KDR cant make 
up their minds if they want to go to
Lets move on to the the top mens and 
womens organizations.
This year Fringe must have learned a 
thing or two from Phi Kap, or at least 
had a really good camera. No matter 
what the situation, they have been 
busy building a new buggy, which, even 
though it has had some initial chute 
problems, looks to be promising. 
Theyve also managed to pull in some 
athletes to push. Just in front of them 
will be SAE A, which has great pushers 
but not all of the commitment it takes 
to make a winning team. PiKA B, who
this year.
As for the women, PiKA A has lost a 
step to Beta and Spirit. Their girls are 
good, but Beta has the queen of Hill 1, 
who will help them secure a secondplace finish. Spirit has always posted 
great womens times and this year I 
dont think theyll have any more prob
lems. The combination of these three 
teams is tops, but dont count out some 
of the other sleeper teams like SDC, 
Pioneers, and Sig Nu.
Now back to the men and the top 
three predictions. Last year Phi Kaps

Best One Year Wonder:

pound football player cant build some
thing that will always make

Best Team of Days Gone By:
ATO  Rebel Yell. In their day, 
they had one of the most reckless com
binations of attitude and brawn, plus 
the average ATO would require that 
extra three years to earn his degree, 
good for building a program.
The A for Effort Team:
Pioneers  every year a dark

rated organization!
Most Successful Organization:
PiKA  Throughout the history of 
Sweepstakes, they have won more than 
anyone else.

Whats the matter, have you lost the

Can you three-peat the three-peat?
Where have all the buggies gone? As 
the year 2000 approaches, I must sit 
back and reminisce  aaaah, the glory 
days. There was a time long ago when 
Flagstaff Hill was packed with specta
tors, from students to professors to 
drunken alumni. Now it seems like 
Hollywood has priority over one of the 
longest-standing traditions at CMU.
Nevertheless, questions exist that 
beg to be answered. Which organiza
tion is the best? Which is the worst? 
Which organization(s) should pack it 
up and go home? Which organizations
And finally the coveted award....
The Best Organization That I Have 
Ever Watched:
Spirit  Buggy comes down to one 
thing, winning on race day. After the 
last heat when the victor stands, it does 
not matter how many hours are logged, 
nor how pretty the buggies are. The 
bottom line is to step up on race day 
and blow everyone away. You guys put 
it together better than anyone else.... 
Do you have it in you to beat everyone 
again this year?
Which brings me to this year. First 
off let me say that Sweepstakes has 
improved since last year. No more cars 
permitted on the roads while buggies 
were rolling, and sweepers and flag
gers were actually doing their jobs. 
The weather, however, has not been 
playing an excellent role. In the fall 
the weather was perfect, with only one 
day canceled because you college stu

push practice or not. Sig Ep wont be 
there because they have no buggy, but 
hopefully next year theyll throw their 
hat into the ring. As for DU, their situ
ation is the exact opposite. They have a 
buggy but refuse to enter it into 
the race.
As for CIA, they still havent found a 
push team good enough to reclaim past 
glory. Is Compubookie the only one 
who remembers that they actually 
won Sweepstakes once upon 
a time?
I know that I always think Pioneers 
will be there on day two, but this year, 
with the loss of some of last years
has usually ruined my predictions in 
the past, will not do it again this year. 
They are good  dont get me wrong  
but this year, the competition in front 
of them is just too strong. Edging them 
out will be the SDC A team, whose 
pushers and teams have more enthusi
asm than any organization Ive seen 
out there this year.
Rounding out the top six will be Sig 
Nu A just behind Spirit B. Even though 
Sig Nu has excellent buggies, the Spir
it B pushers will be slightly faster to 
nudge the spot away from them. In 
fourth place will be Beta A, whose slow 
time last year was not characteristic of
excellent pushers, they have fallen, them and should not happen againEnigma shows off new fashion, talent
third-place finish was no mistake. 
Their buggies consistently roll well and 
theyre a very dedicated team. Phi Kap 
shows how working hard for something 
can definitely pay off. With that said, 
PiKA A has some of these same charac
teristics, but they always have the 
advantage of having faster buggies. 
The fastest, however, is the Spirit bug
gies and pushers. They push the enve
lope year after year, and that is why I 
choose them first again.
Final Note:
To those of you that believe that 
these cart races are a waste of time, I 
invite you to come to Flagstaff hill and 
watch.... Youll catch the fever!

For a college whose student body thinks 
that ironed jeans and plaid shirts are the 
height of fashion, the Enigma-99 fashion 
show must have been something of a reve
lation in clothing for the large audience. 
Sponsored by Spirit and the Office of 
Admission, Enigma-99 took to the catwalk 
last Saturday night to present the latest 
spring wardrobes from local retailers.
The Spirit production opened with a 
smoke-machine-enhanced exhibition in 
which models, clad in all black, paraded 
down the catwalk with small silver masks 
covering their faces. Upon reaching the
end of the runway, they peeked out from 
behind their masks, while the audience 
cheered them on. The predominant theme 
of the skit was simplified clothing  main
ly slacks and t-shirts.
Besides giving the audience the opportu
nity to see a variety of fashions, the stu
dent models, rather than just walking 
down the catwalk, had a good deal of inter
action with each other. Each segment was 
themed, and some had strong story lines.
The opener was followed by a long, soul
ful song performed by the CMU band Fifth 
Avenue, featuring Link Brown II, Kodwo 
Dadzie, Diondre Johnson, Erren Lester, 
and Oyewole Oyenuga. Following Fifth 
Avenue, the models returned to the stage in 
formal dress with males wearing tuxedos 
and the females in lavish evening gowns 
for a skit titled Elegant Seduction.
After a rather casual segment titled 
School Daze, the models took to the stage 
in a scene called Studio 54, in which the 
models acted out the roles of some of the 
customers who may have frequented the 
famed New York hangout. While each new 
model paraded down the runway, the mod
els already on stage were in the back
ground dancing.
Studio 54 was followed by a bright 
scene titled Summer Madness where the 
models showed off summer swim wear. 
Before Enigma broke for intermission, Da 
Ruff Ryders, a CMU group comprised of 
students Andress Appolon, Damali Anika 
Bobb, Haj Chenzira-Pinnock, and Zuley 
Clarke, took to the stage for a fast-paced 
dance number in which they showcased a 
series of notable dance moves.
Following the intermission, the models 
returned to the catwalk for several more 
scenes in which everything from formal 
suits to lingerie was presented to the audi
ence. Perhaps the highlight of the evening 
came at the end of the production.
Ten dancers took to the stage, accompa
nied by two live drummers, to perform a 
traditional West African dance. Dressed in 
bright, colorful clothing  a refreshing 
change from the darker clothing that dom
inated the show  the 10 dancers awed 
the audience with a fast-paced and wellchoreographed dance, directed by Damali 
Anika Bobb Victor.
Enigma-99, overall, was a well-orchestrated production, and the response from 
the enthusiastic audience in attendance 
was impressive.
Carnival offers week
end of entertainment
vf3in!fRs PScb 2uCl Rn
designed to fit in with this 
years young childens stories 
theme.
On the other side of campus, a 
large crowd of fans will be gath
ered on Tech and Frew Streets 
to watch Sweepstakes. The pre
liminary races take place on 
Friday morning, and finals take 
place on Saturday. The first 
races will start around 7:30 am.
When the Friday buggy event 
comes to a close, the 5th Annual 
Mobot Slalom race takes the 
spotlight at noon in front of 
Wean Hall.
Its a competition primarily 
for undergradates, but not 
restricted to undergraduates. 
Contestants build autonomous 
robotic vechicles to follow a 
line on the sidewalk and 
travel through 14 gates, 
said Benjamin Brown, a 
researcher at the Robotics 
Institute and a member of the 
Mobot Committee.
Their performance is based 
on how far they go on the course 
as well as the time it takes to 
get there.
No Mobot has ever successful
ly traveled through all 14 gates 
of the course. The closest finish 
was 11 gates.
[The Mobot competition] pro
vides an opportunity for people 
who cannot participate in the 
buggy race to participate in 
another significant event. It 
doesnt involve a large number 
of people. It can be done by one 
individual or a small group, 
said Brown.
Laser tag, a popular attrac
tion last year in the UC gym, 
will be held again in the gym 
on Saturday.Its basically an 
inflatable laser tag game 
enclosed in a room. You put on a 
vest and gun and they let five or 
so people go in at a time, said 
Dominic Falso, a senior physics 
major. This is only a sampling 
of the events at Carnival. For 
more information and a com
plete schedule, look at the Car
nival web page at http:// 
www. andrew. emu. edu/car nival.
Wang said she hopes for an 
enjoyable event and encourages 
everyone to participate to the 
fullest. Go to all of the events 
that Carnival has to offer. Go 
to buggy and all the booths, not 
just the tall one, because a lot 
of them are beautiful on the 
inside too, she said. Its best 
to just get out and participate 
in the events, instead of staying 
in the dorms and sleeping.

Aesterday I did a cartwheel in my room. When my legs were coming down I slipped, and landed face-first in a pie. Alright. So, all I know is, there wasnt any freaking pie there when I started my cartwheel. What, you think Im stupid? So all Im saying is, whoever put that pie there, Im not happy with you. I better not see you on the street. Im on the lookout for people with red plastic noses or big floppy shoes. Im gonna mess you up, you stupid clown.

The 1999 Buhl Lecture
sponsored by Carnegie Mellons Department of Physics
Over the past century, our understand
ing of the fundamental laws of physics 
has advanced tremendously. Scientists 
have drawn an elegant description of 
the elementary particles of physics and 
the forces acting among them. The 
principal remaining challenge is the 
incorporation of the gravitational force 
into this framework. The leading can
didate for achieving this goal is string 
theory. String theory unites all known 
forces and particles into a singl, co
herent picture. Recent exciting devel
opments show that the theory requires 
a drastic change in our views of the 
nature of space and time.

Think about supporting yourself 
for twenty-five, thirty years or 
longer in retirement. It might be the 
greatest financial test youll ever face. 
Fortunately, you have two valuable 
assets in your favor: time and tax deferral.
The key is to begin saving now. 
Delaying your decision for even a year or 
two can have a big impact on the amount 
of income you'll have when you retire.
What's the simplest way to get started? 
Save in pretax dollars and make the most 
of tax deferral. There's simply no more 
painless or powerful way to build a 
comfortable and secure tomorrow.
SRAs and IRAs makes it easy.
SRAs  tax-deferred annuities from 
TIAA-CREF  and our range of IRAs 
offer smart and easy ways to build the 
extra income your pension and Social 
Security benefits may not cover. They're 
backed by the same exclusive investment 
choices, low expenses, and personal 
service that have made TIAA-CREF the 
retirement plan of choice among America's 
education and research communities.
Call 1 800 842-2776 and find out for 
yourself how easy it is to put yourself 
through retirement when you have time 
and TIAA-CREF on your side.

Spring Carnival. The one week
end each year when we put aside 
our never-ending schoolwork and 
party like its 1999. Oh wait. It 
is. Although the most talkedabout aspects of Carnival are 
booth and buggy, there is a lot 
more to Spring Carnival than 
meets the eye.
The Opening Ceremony will 
commence at 5 pm this Thursday 
at the entrance to the Midway. 
The Pipe and Drum Band will 
lead the ceremony, which will
include a ribbon-cutting.
Concerts by campus ensembles 
will be frequent throughout the 
weekend. The Kiltie Band will 
carry on their yearly tradition of 
having a concert band perfor
mance during Carnival. This 
year, they will play John Will
iams in Concert, selections from 
Sophisticated Ladies, On The 
Mall, Arabesque, and First Quite 
in E flat.
The CMU Soundbytes and Mini
mum Wage, two a cappella groups 
on campus, will also perform. 
Their concerts will be on the Mid
way Stage, and will take place on
Saturday. The Carnegie Mellonbased band 29 will also perform. 
29 band members are drummer 
George K Chow, Matt Aranoff on 
bass, Adam Waite on keys, and 
saxophonist Eric Spaulding. The 
band plays in a style described as 
as jazzy funk with a twist of 
Latin flavor. A third a cappella 
group, Joyful Noise, will also be 
giving their spring concert on Sat
urday. With a repertoire ranging 
from traditional hymns to con
temporary Christian music, this 
concert should complement the 
other two groups, and present a 
like quality.
Also performing at Carnival 
will be Buffo, the Worlds Stron
gest Clown. Buffo is an ex-profes
sional baseball player (formerly 
with the White Sox, Pirates, and 
Astros), who also used to run 
marathons and teach schoool to 
deaf and blind students. Buffo is 
a gentle giant who balances bi
cycles and tables on his face, rips 
phone books in half, and juggles 
bowling balls. On top of that, he 
eats fire, does magic, and much, 
much more.

Amid the booths, buggy races, and per
formances that make up Carnival, one can 
find several opportunities for live music.

headliner Soul Coughing. As a bo
nus, CMU artist Lis Harvey and 
Angry Salad will also perform

Scotch n Soda will be presenting Leonard 
Bernstein and Steven Sondheims classic 
musical, West Side Story, at Carnival 
. this year. West Side Story is a musical 
verison of Romeo and Juliet, set in 
the rough streets of New York during 
the 50s. In place of the two feuding 
families in Romeo and Juliet, in West 
Side Story, two gangs of teenagers 
fight over territory. Both gangs, the 
white American Jets and the 
nativePuerto Rican
O n 
Thursday,
Carnival will begin 
with performances by Lis 
Harvey and Janet Robin. Lis 
Harvey, a junior English ma
jor, performs what she terms 
folk on the rocks: folk music 
with just a slight edge to it. Ap
parently, it manages to strike a 
balance, neither straying too far in 
the direction of anger-driven rock 
nor becoming too placid. Her first CD,
Teen Angst, will be released in May, 
but her first recording, Periphery, is 
currently available.
Janet Robin is touring in support of her 
current full-length CD, Open the Door. 
The album is 13 tracks of quite competent 
folk-rock, and even though comparisons to 
Sheryl Crow and Jewel are rather obvi
ous, Robin manages to sound like neither 
of them. The songs themselves tend to 
stay in the rather fertile folk-rock terri
tory of vitriolic love songs. On the other 
hand, for the most part the songs have 
an interesting lyrical punch that 
keeps them from falling by the musi
cal wayside.
Friday night presents two more 
bands, openers Angry Salad and 
headliners Soul Coughing. Angry 
Salad from Boston is currently on 
tour, primarily to support their 
Voluml mll I,rnvs 2uCl Roo
Sharks, 
go to a dance 
which brings to
gether Tony, the former 
leader of the Jets, and 
Maria, the sister of Bernardo, 
the leader of the Sharks. As 
Tony and Maria fall in love, the 
two groups arrange a fight to de
cide who will get possession of the 
turf once and for all. Tony tries un
successfully to stop the escalating vio
lence, and tragedy ensues.
This play is filled with moments, 
characters, and songs that have be
come classic parts of American pop 
culture. Nearly all the songs are rec
ognizable, like Maria, Somewhere, 
Tonight, I Feel Pretty, America, 
and Somethings Coming. Officer 
Krupke has become a modern icon 
for authority. And the final scene, 
like the final scene in Romeo and 
Juliet, has become one of the clas
sic moments of American theater. 
While at times the dialogue seems 
out-dated, it is a big part of the 
shows appeal.
Past Scotch n Soda carnival 
shows have included Assas
sins, Godspell, Chess,Into the 
Woods, The Mystery of Edwin 
Drood, and Nemeses, which
was a Scotch n Soda original production. 
Scotch n Soda shows for Carnival generally 
have a bigger budget than their 
other shows throughout the 
year, and are able to be 
produced a larger 
scale.
The musicals 
director, Vir
ginia Bond, 
said that she 
chose
West 
Side 
^ Story not 
. only because of
the wonderful music and lyrics, but also 
l' for the important mes
sage the show has to offer. 
^ She wants to make clear that
b the focus of the show is not a racial
conflict between the Puerto Ricans and 
the white Americans. Its about hatred 
and ignorance in general and how that can 
get completely out of control, said Bond. In 
the play, three people die because of it. 
Bond also thinks that West Side Story 
offers an important message to the CMU 
campus specifically, because of the segre
gation between the colleges. In the play, 
[the characters] get reduced to name-call
ing, which is a lot like CMU, where each 
college has its own nickname and stereo
types, she said. In addition, as in the play, 
CMU is also somewhat territorial, with 
people in the same college spending most of 
their time in class and between classes in 
the same buildings.
Scotch n Soda decided to support Bond in 
her choice of West Side Story because they 
thought that it would be a good opportunity 
to get a lot of involvement. Currently there 
are about 50 people involved in the show, 
which stars Catherine Walker as Maria, Joe 
Haughton as Tony, and Kate Tellers as Anita. 
We have an amazing cast and an amazing 
crew. Everyone is just amazing, said Bond.
So at Carnival, definitely make it a point 
to see this show, especially if you have never 
seen it before. The production will run in 
Rangos Hall on Thursday at 8 pm, Friday at 
9 pm, and Sunday at 2 and 4 pm. Tickets are 
available this week at the table in front of 
Doherty for $4 with a CMU ID, or can be 
purchased at the door for $5 with an ID and 
$8 without.

French New Wave 
film magnifies life
By DEREK DREYER
Tartan Staffwriter
Ive always had a love/hate relation
ship with the French New Wave  a 
highly influential movement in cinem 
a that began in the late 50s with 
auteurs like Godard and Truffaut and 
attempted to explore complex issues such 
as sex and politics by reinventing cin
ematic language.
Although I appreciate the goals of the 
New Wave, I find most of the French 
films of this period to be endlessly pre
tentious, incomprehensible and/or bor
ing. But not all. At three and a half 
hours, Jean Eustaches black-and-white 
1973 anti-epic The Mother and the Whore 
might seem a likely candidate for back
ground noise during a nice long nap.
Much to my surprise, I didnt even yawn.
The film, which examines the sex life 
of a quasi-intellectual named Alexandre 
(played by New Wave icon Jean-Pierre 
Leaud), appears to have no plot. Well, a 
little one: Alexandre lives with a woman 
about ten years his senior named Marie 
(the mother, played by Bernadette 
Lafont) who loves him and takes care of 
him. In the first sequence of the film, he 
wakes up and drives off to try to woo 
back an ex-girlfriend.
She almost immediately rejects his 
pleading and informs him that she is 
getting married to someone else. Soon 
after, he sees a pretty girl named 
Veronika (the whore, played by 
Francoise Lebrun in an impressive de
but) at a cafe, he gets her phone num
ber, and they spend the rest of the film 
trying to sort out their relationship.
From the first ten minutes of the 
film it is clear that Alexandre is a selfimportant jerk and it is hard to imag
ine how his (sex) life could be interest
ing at all. I think one reason why it 
becomes interesting is that Eustache 
does not romanticize it.
He focuses in on Alexandres life so 
closely that we are no longer watching 
an intellectual fable about relationships, 
such as in the films of New Waver Eric 
Rohmer, but a true slice of the nothing
Students prep for 
festivals sounds
life. All Alexandre does every day is 
go down to the cafe, meet Veronika and 
other assorted intellectual friends, run 
his mouth off a lot, have sex occasion
ally, and come home in the evening 
to Marie.
Eustache even includes scenes in 
which the characters simply sit and 
listen to songs on a record player. The 
essential emptiness of Alexandres ex
istence, a kind of existence perhaps 
encouraged by French society, is laid 
bare by the films objective, non-judgmental style.
In some ways, The Mother and the 
Whore also reminded me of Manhat
tan, the great Woody Allen film from 
1979. Although its a very different 
movie, Manhattan is, in a way, The 
Daughter and the Whore. Woody 
Allens character dumps his loving, 
down-to-earth 17-year-old girlfriend 
(the daughter) for a quasi-intellectual sexually-experienced woman his 
own age (the whore, played by Diane 
Keaton).
Only at the end does he realize what 
matters to him in life, albeit by then 
its too late. In Eustaches film, 
Alexandre makes no such realization, 
but he does at some point see how 
childishly he has acted toward the one 
woman who is capable of love, Marie, 
and his reaction is simply to stop talk
ing.
If there was any problem I had with 
The Mother and the Whore, it was the 
lack of development of the mother 
character, Marie. The film really fo
cuses on exploring Veronika and 
doesnt try to give any explanation 
why Marie would even find comfort in 
a twerp like Alexandre. Were French 
men really so focused on youth that 
they wouldnt see the utter loveliness 
of Lafonts Marie?
Early in the film, Alexandres exgirlfriend responds dryly to his inces
sant admissions of passion for her: I 
really hope you work it out. The 
Mother and the Whore is a film that 
tries to do just, that by looking at life 
under a magnifying glass.
Outcast-turned-prom-queen 
relives high school trauma
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
High school was a torturous place. If, 
you were part of the popularcrowd, 
you were forced to buy expensive, yet, 
in retrospect, hideous clothes, parade 
around with other people who suit you, 
but whom you may or may not like, 
and, of course, get drunk way 
before that legal age of 21.
If you were, for lack of a 
more politically correct term, 
a geek, then you were prob
ably made fun of by the afore
mentioned popular crew, and 
you most likely suffered from 
such socially isolating physi
cal ailments as braces, glasses, 
neck-braces, corrective shoes, 
or premature facial hair.
But Drew Barrymores new 
film Never Been Kissed gives 
both present and former high 
school geeks a small ray of 
hope in the big bad world of 
adolescent torture: Eight years 
after graduation, you too might 
get the chance to pose as a 17- 
year old student, and hook up 
with your attractive 
Shakespearean Lit teacher.
Not too likely, you say? Well, 
nothing in this film seems even 
remotely plausible, but it nonetheless makes for a cute story.
Drew Barrymore stars as 
25-year-old Josie Gellar, the 
youngest copy editor at the 
Chicago-Sun-Times, and an 
incurable nerd. After her boss 
fires an employee for not writ
ing an award-winning article, he then 
randomly assigns Josie to go under
cover in a local high school and reveal 
some newsworthy scandal.
Josie, anxious to do well on her first 
real reporting assignment, soon finds 
that once sa nerd, always a nerd, and 
is instantly the butt of many an im
mature joke.
David Arquette gives a humorous 
performance as Josies brother Rob,
an ex-high school baseball player with 
a full-time job at the Tikki Post and 
no college education to speak of. Rob 
manages to boost Josies reputation to 
that of prom queen, while her intelli
gence and charm do not go unnoticed 
by her rather interested 
Shakespearean Literature teacher, Mr. 
Coulson, played by Michael Vartan.
 1998 New Line Cinema 
Drew Barrymore stars as an undercover high school 
student in the new film Never Been Kissed.
All in all, Never Been Kissed is a 
charmingly simple film, which, if noth
ing else, shows the world how the high 
school years are by no means the best 
years of your life. Barrymore gives a 
genuinely sweet performance in places, 
but somehow manages to overdo her 
geekdom, making her character a little 
more unbelievable than nerdy.
However, she makes a definite effort 
to maintain consistency, and even when
she is deemed popular, she holds on 
to many of her characters inherent 
nerdy mannerisms.
One of the best performances in the 
film was delivered by 16-year-old Helen 
Hunt look-alike LeeLee Sobieski. 
Sobieski plays Aldys, the class nerd, 
and leader of a math team called The 
Denominators.
Aldys is perpetually teased, 
namely by school heartthrob Guy 
Perkins (Jeremy Jordan), yet possesses the intelligence arid 
strength to stand up to him arid 
his heartless cohorts. Sobieski 
performance is convincing, arid 
almost outshines Barrymores in 
the few scenes they have together.
Vartans performance was also 
handled well, as he was forced tb 
play the part of both an authority 
figure and a romantic lead. As h6 
said in an interview, Its a dif 
lemma for both characters.
She cant say anything to hinj 
about her real purpose there fof 
fear of losing his job. At the sam 
time, he may be falling in lov$ 
with someone whom he thinks i$ 
a 17-year-old student.
While the love story betwe^h 
student and teacher may be a 
high point of the film, it is over
shadowed by the horror of some 
of Josies high school flashbacks.
The costume designers did an 
excellent job of turning an other
wise attractive Drew into your 
standard high school outcast', 
which made the scene where an 
ecstatic Josie, who is all dressed 
up in a hideously shiny pink prom 
dress, is egged during prom night by 
the most popular boy in school all the 
more compelling.
While the second time around Josie 
manages to come through her whole 
experience relatively unscathed, Never 
Been Kissed makes it abundantly clear 
that, prom queen or not, high school 
is an experience that no one in his 
or her right mind would ever want 
to repeat.

Lenny Schmidt will be bringing 
his act to Carnegie Mellons cam
pus. Schmidt has performed at 
The Laugh Factory, The Com
edy Store, and all of the Improvs 
on the West Coast. He studied 
with Johnny Carson, and used 
to focus on improv, but has now 
moved on to doing stand-up. 
Schmidts performances have 
aired on Comedy Central, and 
he has opened for such big-name 
acts as Jim Carrey.
Throughout the weekend, 
other campus groups will be per
forming all over campus. Scotch 
n Soda will offer four perfor
mances of the musical West Side 
Story in Rangos, while senior 
recitals will take place on Satur
day in Mellon Institute. Julie 
Balch will be giving a perfor
mance on basoon, Laura 
Nupponen will give a soprano
performance, and I-Jen Fang 
will be giving a performance 
on both percussion and violin. 
Brian Neibauer, a junior, will 
also be giving a recital on trum
pet on Friday.
Also on Friday will be the 
opening of The Frame Art 
Space Show. The show is open 
from April 12th through April 
18th, with an opening recep
tion from 7 to 9 pm on Friday 
night. Dave Hickey will also 
speak on behalf of the School of 
Art Lecture Series at 5 pm, 
providing a nice lead into The

With all of these various 
shows and presentations, 
there will likely be something 
to strike everyones interest.

Young violinist impresses audience
By ASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor 
& SRINTVAS PULLELA
Tartan Staffwriter
After a lengthy and successful 
tour of the West Coast, the Pitts
burgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) 
returned with force to Heinz Hall 
last Friday night. Led by guest 
conductor Jerry Semkow, the or
chestra showcased its superb mu
sical talent in a program that fea
tured works by two masters of clas
sical music, Peter Tchaikovsky and 
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
The evening commenced with 
Mozarts Divertimento for Strings. 
Originally scored for a string quar
tet, the light hearted overture was 
performed by the strings in the 
orchestra and set the tone for the 
next item on the program.
The highlight of the concert was 
the performance of Mozarts Con
certo No. 5 for Violin and Orches
tra, which featured 19-year old
guest soloist Hilary Hahn. Hahn, 
who has earned recognition as 
one of the finest concert violinists 
of her generation, has performed 
a wide range of pieces with several 
orchestras throughout Europe and 
North America in her brief but 
highly eventful career.
Concerto No. 5, the last of 
Mozarts violin concertos, is also 
considered to be the most musi
cally rich. Hahn handled the mu
sical and technical demands of 
the violin concerto superbly. In 
the first allegro movement, she 
played with incredible fluidity and 
poise. Her tone was pure, and her 
articulation was delicate and pre
cise. She executed the cadenza 
passage with passion and confi
dence. Under Semkows disciplined 
direction, the orchestra played to
gether and held its own.
Hahn continued to play with 
energy throughout the second and 
third movements, although her 
tone suffered slightly. Overall, howSTUDENT TRAVEL

ever, she delivered a powerful 
performance, bringing the audi
ence to its feet upon the concertos 
conclusion.
After a standing ovation and 
three curtain 
calls, Hahn 
came out to 
give an encore 
performance.
She chose to 
play Allegro 
from Sonata 
No. 2 by J.S.
Bach. This se
lection is 
among those 
featured on 
Hahns most 
recent Sony 
Classical CD,
Hilary Hahn 
plays Bach.
Hahns pas
sionate perfor
mance of the piece was marked by 
careful phrasing and a sensitivity 
to suble aspects of articulation 
and dynamics. Her tone was even 
more fluid than when she played 
the concerto. Hahn recieved one 
more standing ovation after her 
encore performance.
After the intermission, the PSO 
returned to the stage for a perfor
mance of Tchaikovsys Symphony 
Number Six. Tchaikovsky said of 
his last symphony, Without exag
geration, I have put my entire soul 
into this symphony. It was clear 
that the PSO put its soul into 
Tchaikovskys magnificent sixth 
symphony to bring it to life.
[This piece is the] keystone of 
my entire oeuvre, said
Tchaikovsky of his requiem-like 
symphony. The piece was pre
sented fluently and skillfully from 
the quiet opening bars of the first 
movement to the end of the work.
Musically, the 
PSO was in top 
form, relating 
Tchaikovskys 
haunting and 
melancholic fi
nale with clarify 
and profundity.
SymphonyNo. 
6 opens with a 
movement filled 
with tribulation 
and uncertainty, 
a theme that 
holds through
out the three 
movements of 
the piece. 
Tchaikovskys 
last symphony 
others in that it 
contains four movements in a 
downcast tone and never offers to 
the audience an escape from the 
gloom that prevails over the work. 
In fact, Tschaikovsky died a mys
terious death nine days after the 
premiere of the symphony in St. 
Petersburg. Described as 
Tschaikowskys last will and testamentby some, the workis clearly 
one of the most important Russian 
works ever written.
The PSOs next concert will be 
on April 30, featuring guest con
ductor James Conlon and PSO concertmaster Andrs Crdenes as so
loist. The program will include 
works by Zemlinsky, Schubert, 
Wieniawski, and Jancek.

On The Waterfront
Hey girls! Marlon Brando alert! Tune into this 
1954 flick for a good dose of raw unabashed hand
someness. Brando plays a misfit named Terry Malloy 
who works on the docks of New York City and 
accidentally becomes involved in a murder executed 
by his boss, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Father 
Barry (Karl Malden) tries to convince Terry to 
reassess his past and make sure that justice is 
served. With a score by Leonard Bernstein and 
charm a la Brando, its no surprise that On the 
Waterfront won eight Oscars and the affection of 
people for years to come.

One look at the packaging of 
Bonewheels Twittering Machine, 
makes it clear that the band is 
one that creates Art. Not art, 
but Art. Art, in this case, is 
evinced by guitars played in that 
feedback-heavy and randomnote-picking experimental 
style, mumbled lyrics about sex 
and angst, and band-member 
pseudonyms like Lethargy (pro
nounced Brett Easton Ellis). 
But fear not: Art, while predict
able and somewhat pretentious, 
has its moments of musical com
petence, and can even be pleas
ant to hear at times.
The songs on Twittering Ma
chine are your basic indie cockrock, created by layering two wellplayed instruments over two in
struments being banged or 
twanged at random in 4/4 time. 
Most of the time, this means a 
steady beat with the sort of snarl
ing guitars and feedback that 
might be heard from local artrockers Don Caballero. But occa
sionally, like in the beginning of 
track six, the band slows down 
long enough to show off the 
guitarists mellow, skillful guitar 
work and ear for pop hooks. For 
those who arent still working out 
their resentment at being picked
on by the jocks in high school, the 
attraction to this album is its 
ballads.
With its hacker-inspired cover 
art and numerous references to 
robots and other science-fiction
pop culture (track four is 
bookended by samples from Star 
Trek; the press release compares 
the band to MST3Ks Gamera), it 
almost seems like Bonewheel 
wants to be indie rocks answer to 
Radioheads OK Computer. But I 
have to say this for the band: It 
may be annoyingly pretentious, 
but at least its not trying to be 
another trendy, radio-ready Gar
bage clone. If heavy, distorted 
guitar-rock is your style and you 
can stomach the lyrics, you may 
want to give it a try. But avoid 
reading the lyric sheet first, un
less you enjoy the Art of angstfilled, horny adolescent boys.
 LORELEI LAIRD
Teen movie features chunk of cheese
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Diversions Editor
Perhaps the lunch lady will be pleased 
with the recent film by Gil Junger, 10 Things 
I Hate About You. After all, in one of the 
cafeteria scenes, the nachos prove to be 
more appealing and fresh than the high 
school students. The fake cheese on the 
chips looks real next to the cheese spread 
across the rest of the movie  maybe the 
cooks used Velveeta.
Its difficult to think of 10 things that I 
liked about 10 Things. Loosely based on The 
Taming of the Shrew, the film depicts the 
relationship between two very different highschool-aged sisters. Katerina (Julia 
Stiles),called Kat, is 
a Sarah Lawrencebound senior whose 
face is usually in 
books, literally. Her 
sister (Larisa 
Oleynik) is the op
posite. Bianca 
longs for popularity 
and doesnt make 
one witty comment 
throughout the film.
The message seems 
to be that girls must 
choose between hav
ing brains or hav
ing friends. Even 
though the same 
could be said for the 
numerous other 
high-school films in 
the Cant Hardly 
Wait genre, the mes
sage is more obvi
ous in the dialogue 
of Ten Things.
Unless you in
clude the California
words which stick out more than they do on the 
tests. Kats character, along with the rest of the 
film, is overdone.
The story evolves from the fact that both 
sisters are faced with their fathers rule: Bianca 
is not allowed to date anyone until Katerina 
does. Because the bitter-tongued Katerina re
fuses to date anyone, and Bianca, a sophomore, 
has her eye on the jocks, the first half of the film 
shows us the conflict through various fight 
scenes. Their arguments are as transparent as 
those on the Jerry Springer show. If it wasnt 
for the wealthy suburban living room where 
the disagreements take place, we might have 
mistaken the movie for an excerpt from 
Springers Too Hot for TV tape.
There are also fight scenes between the sis1999 Touchtone Pictures
Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) and Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) star in the recent high 
school adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew, 10 Things I Hate About You.
sun, the characters are inconsistent and 
give us little reason to become involved with 
them or their story. Even Kat, who is the 
protagonist in the film, is neither believable 
nor likable. She is shown tearing down prom 
signs (more than once), and her bitterness 
and attitude are only backed up with SAT
ters and their one-dimensional father, who 
makes Mr. Brady look hip. The father was not 
actually on screen very much, but when he 
was, he was either watching Rogaine commer
cials or making a fool out of himself. At one 
point in the film, he brings a belly out for 
Bianca before she goes out to a party. The belly
is supposed to make the fifteen-year-old 
look seven months pregnant. Why? So boys 
like him stay away from her?
The climax takes place when the silkshirted Joey (Andrew Keegan) learns of the 
situation and refuses to believe that he cant 
use his money to change everything. He 
decides to use his finances to win over Bianca, 
who has a crush on him, by offering a large 
sum to the outcast Patrick Verona (Heath 
Ledger) to take Kat out. And sure enough, 
after a bit of persuasion from Verona, Kat 
falls for him, and Biancas desperation for a 
boyfriend ends. Joey continues to pay Verona, 
even after they become a couple.
Then of course there is one other portion 
of the film which, even though we might like 
to, we cannot forget  high 
school. The stereotypes in 
these scenes are over the 
edge. One example  the 
single featured Asian student 
wears a t-shirt with an ad
vertisement for Chop Suey. 
Most of the male characters 
look like they are about 25, 
especially Joey, who makes 
Danny Zucco from Grease 
seem like a man of the 90s.
However, despite its 
weaknesses, I was able to 
come up with a list of seven 
things that I enjoyed about 
10 Things I Hate About You. 
1. The absence of Jennifer 
Love Hewitt. 2. The 
soundtrack included songs 
from the old Semisonic al
bum. 3. The paintball se
quence  at least it was 
colorful. 4. Club Skunk. 5. 
The upside-down shot of the 
father: He would have been 
more interesting if he had 
been upside down through
out the film. 6. Names of the minor char
acters: Ms. Perky, Perky Girl, Scurvy, 
Chastity, Wimpy Loser, Laughing Loser, 
Crying Loser, Screaming Loser, and Save 
Ferris Singers. 7. You can make as many 
trips to the concession stand and restroom 
as you want.
Musicians will provide diverse talents
I,rnvs PScb page Rh
new self-titled album, which is 
also their first on a major label.
Their music can easily be de
scribed as melodic, but bitter
sweet rock music. The music 
manages to walk the fine line 
between a song-oriented sound 
and a display of power 
and distortion.
Soul Coughing hails from New 
York City. Their current al
bum, El Oso, further develops 
their formula. Ever since 1994s 
Ruby Vroom, the group has 
played a bizarre yet strangely 
accessible mixture; in any one
of their songs, you can hear ele
ments of free jazz, hip-hop, 
postmodern poetry, alternative 
rock, techno, and almost any
thing else that comes to their 
mind. While this confusing tour 
through the world of music can 
certainly lead to pretentious
ness, M. Doughty and company 
generally manage to be 
eclectic and engaging at the 
same time.
Closing out the Carnival on 
Saturday night are Pittsburghs 
own Fuzzy Comets. Despite hav
ing been performing as a group 
for less than a year, theyre fairly
well-known in the area, due to 
their aggressive performance 
schedule. To describe the Fuzzy 
Comets as a rock band is to be 
rather limiting and vague. As 
their demo Circus King attests, 
the group plays an intriguing 
blend of jazz and folk along side 
slightly skewed rock. To put it 
another way, they play loud pop 
music with a violin thrown in 
for good measure.
If you are looking for some
thing to do between Buggy races, 
sitting on the rides, and watch
ing plays, there is a good deal of 
music at CMU this weekend.
