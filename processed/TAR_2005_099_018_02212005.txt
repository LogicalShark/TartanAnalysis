Mosaic Conference discusses gender issues andfeminism
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
What does Gloria Steinem, a 
woman who has been fighting 
on the feminist front for over 
40 years, think of men who are 
threatened by strong, intelligent 
women? They probably should 
be, Steinem joked during her 
keynote address at the 2005 
Mosaic Conference yesterday in 
the University Center.
Steinems keynote address 
opened the ninth annual confer
ence, titled Activism, Equity, and 
Empowerment: Embracing a New 
Era of Feminism. Traditionally 
a conference on womens issues, 
this years Mosaic Conference for
mally changed its focus to gender 
issues. For the first year since 
the changeover, were moving in 
the right direction, remarked 
Samantha Bushman, the chair of 
the Mosaic planning committee. 
Bushman, a senior psychology 
major, is also the senior gender 
issues intern in the Office of the 
Dean of Student Affairs.
In her keynote address, Steinem 
spoke about the second wave 
of feminism. Steinem noted that 
the first wave of feminism that
followed the Civil Rights move
ment received opposition. The 
first stage of resistance [against 
the movement was] to say, We 
dont need the civil rights move
ment, the womens movement, 
the gay and lesbian movement  
or whatever it is. Its going against 
nature, God, Freudsomebody! 
said Steinem. In its second wave, 
feminism is receiving a new kind 
of challenge. In the next stage of 
resistance  the one in which we 
find ourselves now  we say It 
used to be necessary, but its not 
anymore. And you get words like 
post-feminism, which is like say
ing post-democracy.
But Steinem argued that the 
movement is far from over. At 
the rate we are going, it will take 
50 years to achieve equal pay be
tween men and women, 75 be
tween African-American women 
and white men, and 100 years in 
Congress. I call this not finished, 
she said.
Steinem also noted that the term 
feminist has attracted a nega
tive connotation, deterring those 
who believe in gender equality 
from associating themselves with 
the word. Feminism has been

on gender issues last Sunday in McConomy. Steinem became notable in the 
feminist movement with her 1963 expos on Playboy bunnies.
Declaration of Unity addresses diversity, tolerance

Gathering to promote tolerance, community members and students participate 
in the Declaration of Unity last Thursday on the steps of Doherty Hall.
by Adam Greenberg
Contributing Editor
Thursday afternoon, despite 
a bitter temperature drop, stu
dents from across campus gathon the steps of Doherty 
Hall to promote unity and toler
ance. Calling the gathering a 
Declaration of Unity, a halfdozen students and members of 
the community addressed the 
crowd about personal reflec
tions on diversity at Carnegie 
Mellon, as well as its tolerance 
and respect.
The event was scheduled 
ahead of divisive speaker Malik 
Zulu Shabazz, but while the 
event was concurrent with his 
lecture, organizers wanted to 
maintain a positive message.
It was absolutely in reaction 
to Shabazz, said Josh Mann, a 
first-year business administra
tion major and executive board 
member of Hillel, but it was not 
a protest. In spite of the con
frontational nature of schedul
ing the event immediately before 
Shabazzs lecture, the rally did 
not draw its own protesters.
The Declaration of Unity was
emceed by senior philosophy 
major Rachel Svinkelstin, also 
head of Tartans for Israel and 
former president of Hillel.
We support the values that 
bind us together as a commu
nity, as opposed to those that 
tear us apart, she said. We 
do acknowledge theres a lot of 
tension on campus right now, 
but what a better time to bring 
everyone together than now?
Rachel really made an effort 
to have all races  all creeds 
 there, not just Jews raising 
their voices, said Mann.
Other students commented 
on their experiences on campus. 
Karl Sjogren, a sophomore deci
sion sciences student and a mul
ticultural intern for the Office of 
the Dean of Student Affairs, was 
the only speaker to bring writ
ten remarks. We want to foster 
understanding; we want to fos
ter personal growth, he said.
Though the event was sched
uled as a reply to the invitation 
of Shabazz, only one student 
directly referenced the later 
event. Leo Kontorovich, a doc
toral student in the School of

Shabazz inflames campus 
with controversial speech
by Adam Greenberg
Contributing Editor
Can you  for a moment  
put aside the color of my skin and 
what I stand for and put aside the 
color of your skin and what you 
stand for and shake my hand? 
asked Student Senator Ed Ryan, a 
senior in physics.
Malik Zulu Shabazz paused, 
then spoke: No, sir, I cannot.
Shabazz, an attorney from 
Washington, D.C., and chairman 
of the New Black Panther Party 
for Self-Defense (NBPP), spoke in 
Gregg Hall as part of a 12-city tour 
on Thursday evening. Shabazz 
did eventually shake Ryans hand 
after Ryan explained how he had 
defended Shabazzs funding in 
a Senate meeting three weeks 
prior. Although this exchange 
happened during the questionand-answer section of Shabazzs 
lecture, it was indicative of the 
events overall controversy.
Although Shabazz was earlier 
denied funding from the Office 
of Student Affairs and Senate,

and senior chemical engineering 
major Kierra Wright, who invited 
Shabazz. The event was facili
tated by the NBPP and run by 
their invited guests.
I was all for bringing him 
in, not because of what he was 
preaching, but because I believe 
we shouldnt shield everybody 
from the hate on campus.... Now 
we cannot hide the [diversity] 
issue any longer, said Tanvir 
Suri, a first-year student in busi

Senator. With someone like 
Shabazz, its going to be very hard 
to forget.

CMU to host 
Model UN
by Geetika Bhandari
Junior Staffwriter
The International Relations 
Organization at CMU will be host
ing the first annual 2005 Model UN 
Conference next week, from February 
25 to 27. IRO has been planning to 
host this event since September 2003. 
Roughly 150 high school students 
will be arriving Friday from five dif
ferent states across the nation. The 
conference aims to allow students 
to take on the roles of delegates, 
national leaders, and justices to pro
mote discussion on global affairs. 
Committee meetings taking place 
during the conference will include 
topics such as Nuclear-Weapons-Free 
Zones, Hunger in African States, 
Racism, and Palestinian Refugees.
This [conference] is ... a dream 
we have had for two years now, and 
we were fortunate this year to have a 
great group of committed members 
to help put this together, said James 
Tong, a junior computer science 
major who is also the co-president 
and webmaster of IRO. Many of the 
arriving students are local, and may 
be considering applying to CMU 
for college. Tong said that the IRO 
is very fortunate to have the sup
port of many different people and 
groups on campus, including H&SS 
departments, Dean of Student Affairs

Though improving, Thistle 
remains on rough footing

This is Part Two of a two-part 
series on the Thistle, Carnegie 
Mellons yearbook.
The Thistle was in bad shape. 
Joshua Chaise, a mechanical and 
biomedical engineering sopho
more in 2003, didnt have editors 
to make the yearbook. He didnt 
have the customary snippets of 
text that accompany each organi
zations page. He only had photos, 
and even then, there were gaps in 
the coverage, especially in cam
pus sports. When Chaise joined 
as a first-year, he did not intend 
to rise to the top of the yearbook 
organization. I definitely had no 
motivation from the beginning to 
be editor-in-chief .... It worked 
out that way based on the fact 
that I just kept contributing work 
to the yearbook.
Shipped out this past December 
after a year-long delay, the 2003 
yearbooks appearance reflect
ed the state of the organization 
that published it. The design 
was changed  its more of a 
scrapbook, a coffee-table year
book, said Chaise, who has held 
his position since the summer of
2003. Unlike the Thistle, year
books usually organize their con
tent by student organization and 
major campus event. Past Thistles 
have included sections featuring 
individual fraternities, sororities, 
and events like homecoming.
Some find the new layout effec
tive, evoking memories and emo
tions. I like the layout; it flows, 
said Ken Andreyo, head of pho
tographic services at Carnegie 
Mellon. Andreyo pointed out one 
spread with a Carnegie Mellon 
parking officer writing tickets for 
car windshields. Yeah, that guy, 
he got me several times. He loves 
it too. Andreyo was a source 
of aid for the Thistle, providing 
several sports photos from the 
Universitys 2003 archive.
The idea of canceling the 2003 
yearbook was briefly considered. 
Even if there are low numbers 
now and even if were behind, 
alumni in the future will appreci
ate it and yearbooks usually arent 
appreciated right after graduation 
but 10 years down the line, when 
an alumnus comes back to cam
pus ... they want to see it. They 
dont want to be like, Oh, actually,

Universities are on the forefront of 
intellectual exploration because they 
allow the free exchange of ideas, including 
 and perhaps especially  ideas that 
are controversial and unpopular. This 
openness exposes students to perspectives 
that may cause emotional hurt. This is 
one of the consequences of freedom.
Carnegie Mellons policy on 
controversial speakers states that If 
[students] are to learn to choose wisely, 
they must know what the choices are;
and they must learn in an environment 
where no idea is unthinkable and 
where no alternative is withheld from 
their consideration.... When so-called 
controversial speakers are invited to 
the campus by a recognized campus 
organization, they speak not because 
they have a right to be heard but because 
the students have a right to hear.
Malik Zulu Shabazz, like all those who 
spoke before him, spoke on our campus 
because he was invited here by a group 
of students. I attended his speech and, 
while I did not agree with much of it, I 
will defend the students right to hear 
him speak. Now that it has passed, the
event has raised many issues that should 
be addressed by student government and 
the student body as a whole.
Events like this bring to the surface 
many of the tensions that underlie 
student interactions on this campus. It is 
important that we address these tensions, 
while they are running high, in a way 
that is respectful of each other. Relations 
between students and student groups can 
only improve if we listen to each other 
with respect.
That which is controversial is  by 
definition  open to discussion, but too 
often controversy leads to resentment 
instead of dialogue. To facilitate dialogue,
student government and the Office of the 
Dean of Student Affairs have sponsored 
a town hall meeting today at 4:30 pm in 
Baker Halls Adamson Wing. The topic 
of this meeting will be Free Speech 
and Community Building: a discussion 
on the rights and responsibilities of the 
campus community in creating a positive 
and productive climate for discourse on 
critical issues of shared importance. I 
hope you will attend.
Please feel free to visit the Student Body

The Tartan has received access 
to events at CMU for as long as its 
staff has consisted solely of Carnegie 
Mellon students. But last Thursday, 
this agreement failed: New Black 
Panther guards forcibly prevented 
Tartan photographers from taking 
photographic images from Malik 
Zulu Shabazzs lecture to the very 
students who paid for the event to 
occur through their student activities 
fee.
Had cmuTV tried to attend the 
Shabazz lecture, they would have 
been forcibly removed as well, due 
to a confusing and conflicting set of 
rules that SPIRIT laid down moments 
before the event. In such an environ
ment, even CMUs radio station, 
WRCT, could have been removed if 
SPIRIT had so mandated. Regardless 
of the type of event and regardless of 
the organization hosting the event, 
barring student media on campus in 
this manner sets an extremely dan
gerous precedent.
Every week, the staff of The Tartan 
works to make sure Carnegie Mellon 
students can pick up the newspaper 
and be informed of the events and 
discussions occurring on campus. A 
great deal of our mission is to be a 
conduit for information and analy
sis  to which all students rightfully 
have access.
Preventing the student press from 
reporting on the events on our cam
pus is indistinguishable from pre
venting student attendance. Record
ing audio, video, or still images is no 
exception. We are 40 years past the 
Free Speech movement of UC Berke
ley in 1964; it is disappointing that 
student media would face one of the 
same problems today.
The Tartan was told that they were 
not allowed to chronicle the event be
cause of poor coordination. A lack of 
proper communication and planning 
meant that since the event had al
ready begun, it would be too difficult 
to relay press permission to the sev
eral New Black Panther guards scat
tered throughout the auditorium. 
Considering that two such guards 
had threatened and then forcibly 
ejected The Tartans photographers, 
it was believable. But the fact re
mains: when SPIRITs organizers for
bade The Tartan to take photographs, 
they blindfolded the entire student 
body  and all future students who 
might one day peer back through the 
archives.
Currendy, there is little to protect 
the right and responsibility of the 
student media to report on events 
across our campus. While it has sel
dom become a problem in the past, it 
now glares straight in the faces of the 
policymakers of our community.
No student organization, whatever 
its affiliation, should have the ability 
to unilaterally exclude any student 
media organization from a studentsponsored and publicly advertised 
event. This is an important issue that 
must be discussed in the coming days 
and weeks.
The student media organizations 
of Carnegie Mellon University must 
vigorously take up the deficiency of 
the student medias right to report. 
Students are involved in all aspects of 
campus media: cmuTV, the Carnegie 
Pulse, WRCT, and The Tartan span 
broadcast to print. The Division of 
Student Affairs must consider how 
this affects all of these organizations 
in considering how best to address 
this issue.
The ideal result is unclear, but the 
objective is to ensure that all recog
nized media organizations have the 
right to document campus events 
that are funded in whole or in part by 
the student activities fee, so long as 
this documentation is not obtrusive, 
is not confrontational, and does not 
interfere with the event itself.

Michael Murphy, the Office of

and Starbucks. Starbucks will be 
providing coffee for the delegates.
The Model UN students will 
be staying at Wyndham Gardens 
in South Oakland, and many of 
their activities will take place in 
McConomy Auditorium in the 
University Center. Several speak
ers will be scheduled to speak dur
ing this conference, though they 
have not been completely finalized 
at this time.
In addition, the University of 
Chicago will be holding a Model 
UN conference this March, and the 
University of Pennsylvania held a 
conference in November.
IRO vice-president Saurabh
Agarwal, a sophomore ECE major, 
said, Not only would this propel 
CMU into a higher involvement 
in international relations, but 
would also promote our campus to 
students from around the United 
States. The IRO is very pleased 
with such a large turnout of regis
tered high school students for the 
conference.
The IRO aims to promote global * 
awareness on international issues, 
as well as to increase open-mindedness and activity on campus. 
Agarwal stated that the organi
zation attempted to increase stu
dent participation in the club 
and conference during activities 
fair to encourage students to join 
the club, as they needed all the 
involvement they could get in 
preparation for upcoming events.
Thistle remains uncertain
THISTLE, from A1
yearbook, said Chaise.
Chaise juggled many parts 
of his life to make time for the 
yearbook, including a term as 
2003-2004 president of Carnegie 
Mellons chapter of Alpha Epsilon 
Pi, to publish the 2003 and 2004 
editions. I was studying for the 
MCATs last summer. I was also 
partially volunteering at an intern
ship I did the summer before and I 
needed something else to keep me 
busy at nights and on weekends 
sometimes.
Last weeks meeting, however, 
did not bode well for the future 
of student involvement for the 
Thistle. Last fall, recruiting efforts 
obtained pledges of involvement 
from 13 students besides Chaise, 
including two photographers and 
11 editors/photographers. Of the
potential staff, nearly three-quarters are first-years, said Chaise.
Out of the expected 13 students, 
only one student showed up. Ive 
always been just a photographer, 
said Elijah Dobrusin, the only per
son at the meeting. Dobrusin, a 
masters student in mechanical 
engineering, has been a photogra
pher for the Thistle for all five years 
hes been at Carnegie Mellon.
As president of the Photo Club 
on campus, Dobrusin still finds 
working for the Thistle rewarding. 
Taking photos for the Thistle was 
the first time I thought I could see 
these shots in a fashion magazine, 
which I would be interested in if I 
werent an engineer, he said.
But although the efforts of 
a few students have pulled the 
Thistle from the brink this year, 
nobody can predict what will hap
pen next.
Declaration of Unity counters Shabazzs speech
UNITY, from A1
Rachel Svinkelstin, a senior philosophy major and co-founder and President of Tartans for Israel, speaks to stu
dents and community members outside Doherty Hall during Thursdays Declaration of Unity.
Computer Science, said, Why? 
Why bring a hatemonger to cam
pus?... Free speech here is not the 
issue: Were not obligated to pro
vide a forum for hatred.
Later, in response to the Unity 
event, Shabazz read an excerpt 
from the declaration and mocked 
it. We will be standing together 
across all boundaries of faith, color, 
nationality, and sexual orientation 
to say loudly and proudly that we 
all support and have respect for 
one another. That must have just 
happened today, because of what 
I heard there aint no respect for 
our people on this campus. After 
he finished reading the statement, 
Shabazz discarded it on the floor.
The final speakers at the 
Declaration of Unity were mem
bers of the public whom 
Svinkelstein invited to address the 
crowd. The first was Tim Vining, 
executive director of the Thomas 
Merton Center, who expressed 
his vision for a positively defined 
diversity on campus. I think that 
the choice youre making today is 
evident: that in the experiences 
of oppression and discrimination 
that we can choose to reach out 
and to understand and to love, 
he said.
MOSAIC, from A1
treated to a campaign of demonization over the past 20 years, 
she said, saying that people have 
begun calling the movement hu
manist.
She also stressed how impor
tant the movement is for men as 
well. I hope that we understand 
that ... this is a movement about 
becoming whole human beings, 
she said.
According to Steinem, society 
deems 25 percent of innate human 
qualities feminine and considers 
the other 75 percent masculine. 
She argues that although women 
are more deprived, men are just as 
affected, as our culture penalizes 
men for such actions as expressing 
emotions, uncertainty, sadness, 
and developing a close relation
ship with their children. To make 
up for such forced emotional sepa
ration, men are more likely to en
gage in addictive behaviors, such 
as alcohol.
We are born male or female. 
We dont have to prove masculin
ity or femininity  those roles 
simply do not exist. They change 
completely from one culture to the 
next, Steinem remarked.
Steinem also said that issues 
of gender equality permeate into 
the home. She notes that, while 
daughters are raised like boys, the 
opposite rarely occurs. Similarly, 
society enforces gender roles 
much earlier in boys than girls, 
and this cuts off a significant area 
of emotional development and ex
ploration.
Weve convinced most of the 
country that women can do what 
men can do ... but we havent con
vinced them that men can do what 
women can do, she said.
Following Steinems speech, the 
audience attended three sessions 
featuring various speakers.
Because the conference usually 
draws students from H&SS, said 
Bushman, the planning committee 
actively tried to attract students
from other colleges by including 
such panels as Gender and Game 
Creation and Perceptions of 
Women in Science.
During the latter discussion, bi
ology professor Amy Burkert noted 
that careers in the sciences can be 
difficult for women because they 
require long-range curriculum 
planning.
According to chemistry profes
sor Karen Stump, many women 
in science feel like impostors, 
forgetting about their own abilities 
and hard work and thinking that 
luck brought them success. [They 
feel that] at some point theyre 
going to be found out that theyre 
not as capable as they should be to 
be in the position that theyre in, 
said Stump. This is one of the fac
tors why women are not rising as 
often as they should or choosing 
to opt out of career path that will 
take them farther up the ladder.
In another panel discussion, 
associate history professor Scott 
Sandage spoke about the right 
to fail during the past 50 years 
in American history, stating, The 
equal right to succeed brings with 
it the equal right to fail.
The struggle for equality may 
not be letting women into board
rooms so that they too can work 
80-hour weeks. But the struggle 
for equality may be the idea that 
nobody  men nor women  
should be obliged to give all of 
their time and energy to profes
sional achievement, Sandage 
said.
Overall, the planning commit
tee feels satisfied with the gender 
representation at the conference. 
Weve had more men registered 
than in years past .... I feel like 
they were well represented, said 
Rebecca Steinberg, a junior English 
major and a Mosaic Planning 
Committee member.
Even though its a conference 
on gender issues, people still 
have in their minds that gender 
issues means women issues, said 
Bushman.
discussed, and Im disgusted.
Ten minutes into the speech, 
Shabazzs speech was cut short 
as the auditorium lights blacked 
out. Amidst cries of sabotage 
and blame, Shabazz composed 
himself and  lit by the projec
tor  continued his talk. Amidst 
the confusion, he likened the sit
uation to that inside a slave ship 
as dozens of members of the 
audience tried to augment the 
light with their cellular phones.
Shabazzs lecture strayed at 
times to various issues, many 
of which contained anti-Jew or 
anti-Zionist messages. In one, 
he called the Anti-Defamation 
League  an organization 
which aims to prevent Jewish 
and other cultural discrimina
tion  an organization founded 
by gangsters. He also examined 
Jewish religious law and its im
plications to present-day rela
tions between Africans and Jews 
and the current land dispute in 
Palestine.
To the members of the 
[Carnegie Mellon] Arab Student 
Organization: Youve got an ally 
here, said Shabazz to the many 
ASO members in the audience.
Shabazz continued on other 
topics, calling what he thought 
were the underrepresented top
ics of the Tulsa, Okla., economic 
riots of 1921 and the Chicago 
race riots of 1919 examples 
of the multi-century Black 
Holocaust. He also spoke of 
ancient history, including a de
tailed description of how blacks 
inhabited Earth before whites.
The reason I enjoyed the lec
ture is because he talks about 
all the things that black peo
ple went through, and how we 
should be proud of who we are 
because of that struggle, said 
Jarel Copney, a sophomore 
mathematical sciences major. 
He gave us a perspective of our 
history that most of us did not
Roddy of the Pittsburgh PostGazette asked whether Shabazz 
believed white racism was ge
netically encoded. Citing the 
photos of lynching and other 
atrocities that hung behind him, 
Shabazz eventually responded 
that I believe these problems 
result from the very nature of 
white people.
I strongly agree with his 
views on the importance of 
education and attaining knowl
edge in empowering people, 
said Nur Azlina Abdul Aziz, the 
president of the Muslim Student 
Association. But at the same 
time I disagree with views on 
how certain groups can bear 
burdens of guilt based on the 
color of their skin.
As a closing, Shabazz offered 
an inclusive activity where he 
directed all in the room to form 
a circle. In perhaps the clearest 
demonstration all evening of his 
stated purpose on campus, he 
then led the group in an affir
mation of common purpose and 
cheers for unity.
Following the lecture, dia
logue erupted both around the 
lecture hall and on the campuss 
electronic forum cmu.misc.market. Many questioned whether 
inviting Shabazz was prudent, 
how close Shabazz stayed to 
his topic, and what response 
members of SPIRIT had to the 
community outcry.
To SPIRITs credit, they 
sought out a lot of opinions 
about the event, said Murphy. 
I do believe that many members 
of the SPIRIT organization be
lieved that he was going to give 
a talk about African history and 
the rights and responsibilities 
of the African-American college 
students, and it clearly wasnt 
that.... I think the intent was 
genuine.
The online debate included 
several implied threats against

Some of his statements ex
pressed positive sentiments, 
such as: Im striving for a righ
teous, clean, and productive 
society for my people. Many, 
though, were punctuated by di
visive comments: Lets be hon
est: White folks are white folks! 
Can you tell the difference? 
Shabazz, however, denied alle
gations of racism, asking, How 
can I be a racist? All we are is 
victims of racism.
Responding to calls that 
Shabazzs lecture strayed, 
Abigail Cyntje stated, The lec
ture that Attorney Shabazz pre
sented did state that the role 
and responsibility of the black 
college student is to know the 
truth about your history and ... 
to help advance your commu
nity. Though Attorney Shabazz 
did touch on the topic at hand 
there were segments of his lec
ture that responded to the hos
tility towards him and the event. 
We did not expect the lecture to 
go off topic.
The event continued with 
a town hall meeting. Dennis

of SPIRIT: Dont look at all of

definitely not the case. And its 
definitely not the case even as a 
collective body, that we all dont 
have the same view he does.

idea.... Now its out there.

good idea, he said. That kind 
of hurtful and hateful rhetoric 
doesnt have a place in construc
tive dialogue.
To gain admittance to Gregg 
Hall, guests were searched by 
hand and metal detector by 
Carnegie Mellon University 
Police, who patrolled the event. 
Many were denied admission 
from the lecture; others entered 
by jumping the queue.
I was in the first row and I 
was waiting for a long time, 
said Marina Meyster, a first-year 
student in SHS. At one point 
they wanted to let six people 
in, but [security personnel] 
would just basically just pull out 
African Americans out of the 
crowd.
The lecture hall was filled 
with students and members of 
the community. The majority 
of the attendees were AfricanAmerican. Around the Porter 
100 dais, several NBPP members 
stood in uniform  at least one 
of whom was armed with a billy 
club, permitted on the spot 
by Campus Police. However, 
only audience members were 
checked for weaponry, accord
ing to campus police chief Creig 
Doyle; presenters and NBPP 
guards were not scanned.
The event started smoothly 
as a man referred to as a com
munity elder chanted of black 
history with a powerful voice 
resonating throughout the audi
torium. This was followed by an 
invocation, called a libation, and 
the singing of Lift Evry Voice, 
the Black National Anthem.
Next was a representative 
from Minister Louis Farrakhan, 
leader of the Nation of Islam. 
His statements rallied the crowd 
in preparation for Shabazz; the 
crowd reacted strongly as he 
said, Any time you see a strong 
black man stand up to speak 
truth, controversial is always
put on the front of his name.... 
There is no speaker of truth in 
the history of the world that 
has not been controversial. 
References to Farrakhan and 
Islam prefaced Shabazzs lec
ture, setting a strong black and 
Islamic connection for the rest 
of the presentations.
Controversial speakers are 
so named because they do just 
that: bring controversy. Just be
cause I didnt agree with his 
opinions on many issues doesnt 
mean he shouldnt be able to 
speak, wrote junior biological 
science major Sally Maikarfi, a 
SPIRIT member who attended 
the lecture.
Wright then introduced 
Shabazz. This man is well 
versed in world issues, national, 
and local politics, she said. 
Hes so much more than the 
national chairman of the New 
Black Panther Party.
Shabazz entered with a stand
ing ovation. Shabazz started 
his presentation with his own 
smaller invocation and the first 
of many references to Farrakhan. 
To aid his argument, Shabazz 
also brought with him an array 
of historical, religious, and opin
ion texts, including The Iceman 
Inheritance, by Michael Bradley, 
and The International Jew. by 
Ford Motor Company founder 
Henry Ford.
After listing his own achieve
ments, such as having been 
voted Young Lawyer of the Year 
by the National Bar Association 
and winning court victories 
against anti-organizers, Shabazz 
himself eventually described his 
purpose in addressing the crowd 
as the roles and responsibilities 
of the black college student and 
white racism, adding the phrase 
white racism himself. After dis
cussing the difficulty in coming 
after his funding was refused, 
Shabazz said of the University: 
This is supposed to be a place 
where diversity and ideas can be

The space shuttle will return 
to service on May 15, NASA has 
announced. Discovery will be the 
first shuttle to fly since Columbia 
exploded while returning to Earth 
in February 2003. It will have the 
mission of testing out new safety 
procedures instituted after the 
Columbia disaster, and will launch 
during the day so that officials can 
analyze systems during takeoff.
NASA engineers are particu
larly concerned with the foam 
used on the fuel tank, the tiles 
that compose the heat shield, 
and the carbon composite used 
on the shuttles wings. While in 
orbit, Discoverys crew will test 
new repair procedures and look 
over the heat shield. The shuttle 
Atlantis will be standing by in 
case a rescue mission is neces
sary. If the mission is successful, 
NASA will resume work on the

Lunar path plots may 
explaindark energy
New super-accurate maps of 
the path of the moon could help 
researchers find problems in 
Einsteins theory of relativity and 
help explain he expanding nature 
of the universe. Researchers at 
New York University believe that 
gravity could have unexpected 
effects when it acts across large 
distances, and that those effects 
could be responsible for the fact 
that the universe continues to 
grow. Formerly, scientists had 
attributed the growth to dark 
energy, which acted contrary to 
the known forces of the universe.
Researchers will generate the 
maps by firing lasers at mirrors 
left on the moon by the crew of 
Apollo 11 and calculating the time 
it takes for photons to come back 
to Earth. With this technique, 
astronomers will know the path 
of the moon to within a few centi
meters of error.

Transplant timing 
perfected at Pitt
Doctors have long known 
that patients with end-stage 
liver disease can only be saved 
by liver transplants, but doctors 
have difficulties deciding when 
the transplants should be per
formed. If transplants occur too 
early, patients lose some of the 
time during which they could 
have used their natural livers, but 
if they happen too late, serious 
health problems can arise.
Last Saturday, University of 
Pittsburgh researcher Andrew 
Schaefer announced new mathbased methods for calculating 
the optimal time for a transplant 
to take place. The human liver 
can regenerate itself. In cases of 
half-liver transplants, both the 
donor and donee generally have 
full-sized livers again within two 
weeks. However, the procedure 
involves some risk to the donor, so 
patients often prefer to avoid it.

sea, rail, and road transport. Intermodal 
transportation is so efficient here that 
Asian goods destined for Western Europe 
often travel across America instead of 
traveling the shorter distance across the 
Eastern Hemisphere.
The third arrangement and the focus 
of this article is the single wagon train. 
These trains, contrary to their name, con
tain many varied types of rolling stock 
all bound for different destinations. The 
single wagon train is the preferred mode 
of transport for customers who need to 
send or receive freight but arent trans
porting it in the high volume necessary 
for block trains. For example, a factory 
may regularly receive several tank cars 
filled with the cooking oil needed to bake 
Twinkies.
The marshalling yard was designed 
around the needs of single wagon trains. 
How does one go about moving the lum
ber from Cleveland to the train with the 
fuel oil from West Virginia then over to 
the Pittsburgh-bound train with the ship
ment of ice cream? Good question, and a 
complicated sentence to boot. To lay out 
a solution, let us first look at the restric
tions of rail transportation.
Obviously, rolling stock is confined 
to the rails, and can only move forward 
or back. Luckily, almost all cars are bi
directional, so it doesnt matter which 
direction they face when connected to 
a train. Freight cars are unpowered, so 
they require an applied force for move
ment. Finally, because they can couple 
and decouple as needed, the wagons can 
move either individually or as a group.
With these restrictions in mind, the 
railroad siding was developed.
Sidings are stretches of track con
nected in parallel to their parent line 
to allow trains to pass each other. A 
marshalling yard is simply a group of 
many sidings side by side, so that a large 
amount of freight can be rearranged at
once. The largest marshalling yard in 
the world covers almost 3000 acres, is 
eight miles long, and is capable of sorting 
10,000 freight cars every day.
Now that one has the appropriate 
track layout, the question remains: How 
does one get the freight cars where they 
need to be? This is primarily accom
plished by shunting engines, which are 
small locomotives assigned to marshal
ling yards. Shunting engines detach one 
or more cars from arriving trains and 
move them to appropriate sidings, form
ing strings of cars that eventually be
come outbound trains. Tracks which by
pass the yard allow through-traffic such 
as block and passenger trains to continue 
on at high speed.
One development for marshalling 
yards was the gravity hump. The gravity 
hump is basically a hill at the entrance 
of the yard down which cars roll, us
ing gravity to bring them to appropriate 
sidings. Track switches are set either 
manually or electronically so each car 
follows the correct path, and brakes on 
the tracks known as retarders slow cars 
as they speed down the hill. These hump 
yards, as they are called, are most com
mon among larger marshalling yards.
Hump yards are often preceded by sev
eral sidings known as a reception yard. 
These sidings serve to hold trains waiting 
for their freight to be processed through 
the hump yard. Shunting engines de
couple cars from these waiting trains 
and drop them at the crest of the gravity 
hump, where Mother Earth takes over.
Technology has aided this process 
within the last decade. Computer-aided 
dispatching can instantly optimize the se
quencing of operations. Remote-control 
shunting engines have been developed to 
reduce manpower requirements. An iden
tification system called the Automatic

New model shows black holes guide galaxy formation
by Hanadie Yousef
Junior Staffwriter
New computer simulations at 
CMU have revealed that black 
holes do not just swallow up mat
ter and light in the universe. As 
they form, black holes release tor
rents of energy that plays a cen
tral role in galaxy formation.
Using a new computer model 
of galaxy formation, CMU astro
physicist Tiziana Di Matteo and 
her colleagues, Volker Springel of 
the Max Planck Institute for As
trophysics and Lars Hernquist of 
Harvard University, were able to 
show that black holes are needed 
to successfully model the distribu
tion and properties of galaxies in 
the universe. The results indicate 
that growing black holes release 
blasts of energy that regulate 
quasar formation. Gases absorb 
the energy and are blown to the 
fringes of the galaxy.
Our computer simulation 
simulates two galaxies with black 
holes colliding. This drives a lot 
of gas into the object which is 
what powers the quasar, so we 
find why the quasar switches on 
in this way, said Di Matteo. It 
switches off because all the en
ergy black holes emit is absorbed 
by gas, which absorbs so much ki
netic and thermal energy that it is 
blown away, abruptly stopping it
self. We call this self-regulation.
The process of galaxy colli
sion, the resultant creation of a 
black hole, and the achievement 
of self-sustenance takes hundreds 
of millions of years to occur. The 
development of a computer simu
lation allows for researchers to 
reasonably observe such a large 
time span and observe the role of 
black holes in galactic evolution 
for the first time.
We no longer have to wait
around for natural phenomena to 
occur, said Daniel Bock, a doc
toral student in astrophysics and 
a member of CMUs Astronomy 
Club. Astrophysicists are now 
coming closer than ever to un
derstanding the formation of the 
universe from the time of the Big 
Bang.
A black hole is a region of 
space-time formed by the col
lapse of a massive object, such 
as a stars collapse upon itself 
as a result of the exhaustion of 
its hydrogen through nuclear fu
sion and its internal gravitational 
pull. When galaxies collide due to 
their strong gravitational attrac
tion, the black holes at their cen
ters merge to form supermassive 
black holes. A black hole is called 
black because nothing, not even 
light, can escape its grasp.
Every galaxy, including our 
own, the Milky Way, has a black 
hole at the center. Black holes are 
extremely massive and compact, 
and cant be seen directly. Obser
vational evidence of the gravita
tional effect on the stars and gas 
at the center of a galaxy indicates 
a black holes existence. Only re
cently has the role of black holes 
in the process of galaxy-building 
been clearly defined.
The newest findings indicate 
that black holes are needed in or
der to successfully model the dis
tribution and property of galaxies 
as we see them in the universe, 
said Reinhard A. Schumacher, a 
professor of physics at CMU. We 
didnt have any models until now 
for calculating what these proper
ties were. The computer simula
tions revealed that black holes 
in small galaxies produce fewer 
stars than those in large galaxies.
A smaller galaxy contains less 
gas, resulting in a smaller amount

Every year, U.S. railroads transport 
seven tons of freight for every single 
person in the country. Our freight trains 
transport more goods than all of Europes 
railroads combined. Rail networks con
tinue to connect us both physically and 
economically, keeping the wheels of the 
world rolling. But the reality equates to 
a huge logistical nightmare in getting 
freight from Point A to Point B. The mar
shalling yard is one approach engineers 
take in solving this problem.
But before going into the specifics of 
freight marshalling, it is helpful to un
derstand the three basic types of freight 
train arrangement. The most basic is 
the block train. Block trains move many 
freight cars of identical cargo directly 
from one place to another. These trains 
are only economical for high-volume 
customers. They are useful in moving 
numerous important items, such as new 
automobiles, grain, and coal.
The second arrangement is the intermodal train. The word intermodal refers 
to something with multiple modes of 
transportation, by which containerized

Speech accent archive
Have you ever been awake at night, toss
ing and turning, wondering what a Khmer 
accent sounds like? If so, then the Speech 
Accent Archive might be your answer. 
Created in 1999 by Pittsburgh native Steven 
Weinberger, the archive features recordings 
of speakers from over 100 different lan
guage backgrounds. Weinberger, the direc
tor of linguistics at George Mason University, 
began the archive after a challenge he posed 
to students in his courses. I always used to 
have them go out and record a non-native 
speaker and then analyze their speech, 
he said. Weinberger noticed a lack of uni
formity in the recordings that his students 
brought in. He and his students sought to 
regulate the results, and the Archive was 
born. We constructed a paragraph with 
virtually all of the English consonants and 
consonant clusters known to be difficult for 
learners, Weinberger said. He and his stu
dents went on to record samples of speak
ers reading the paragraph, and compiled 
them onto the webpage. Six years after the 
websites creation, he continues to receive 
submissions from listeners worldwide.
Weinberger has found that it isnt 
just academic linguists who make use 
of the website. Its a great help to a lot 
of ESL [English as a Second Language] 
teachers, speech pathologists, actors, 
and electrical engineers who are doing

are, or how a small temperature change 
can lead to such a dramatic morphology 
change.
On the website, Libbrecht describes the 
physics of crystal growth with everyday 
language. The more historic aspects include 
early snowflake classification charts and 
descriptions of the scientists who were the 
first to record them.
Despite the volume of information on 
the website, it is easy to read and navigate 
through Libbrechts work.
Features:
In addition to the catalogue of snowflake 
images and videos, there is an in-depth 
guide to the physics of ice crystal formation 
and an explanation of snowflake photog
raphy. The site also includes some of the 
experimental techniques that Libbrecht has 
employed.

Kids enjoy 
engineering 
celebration
ENGINEERS, from A4
National Future City Competition, 
seventhand eighthgraders de
sign and build a city of the future. 
This years Pittsburgh Regional 
City Competition winners for best 
design were Luke Belechak, Sean 
Hospodar, and Cathy Perego, 
students of St. Bede School, 
sponsored in the competition by 
Carnegie Mellon. But these stu
dents of St. Bede School could not 
attend the celebration on Satur
day. Instead, they celebrated en
gineering at the National Future 
City Competition in Washington, 
D.C. The competition will end 
this Thursday.
Other organizations that 
built hands-on demonstrations 
included the Carnegie Mellon 
mechanical engineering depart
ment, which gave children the ma
terials to build bridges; Tetra Tech 
Nos Inc., which presented Install 
a Water Well; KNEX, which built 
a colorful mechanical crane; the 
American Institute of Chemi
cal Engineering, which brought 
ingredients for children to make a 
superball; and LANXESS, which 
brought bubbles. Also, Carnegie 
Mellon powered a Robots Hall of 
Fame, featuring information and 
a video of robots that starred in 
movies and commercials.
Pittsburgh certainly celebrated 
engineering this weekend. The 
kids are really into it.... They want 
to come back two or three times, 
said Seth Blumsack, a graduate 
student in engineering and pub
lic policy. Blumsack ran the En
gineering and Public Policy table, 
where he taught children the dif
ference between trash that can 
decompose and trash that cannot. 
He was surprised to find that chil
dren didnt recognize the picture 
of a floppy disk while they were 
fishing for trash. One kid asked 
if the floppy disk was a garage 
door, said Blumsack.
National Engineers Week 
continues through next Saturday.

THE TARTANPage A8
mmmm mm | HMK g     aFromTheEditonalBoard  _________________________________________    Gladiator pushes CMU closer to unethical military research
Carnegie Mellon should change its 
motto to My heart is in the military. CMU 
recently beat out Lockheed Martin for a 
Department of Defense contract, mark
ing the Universitys talents as superior 
to a large defense contractors expertise. 
This binding agreement says a lot about 
the path our school has been traveling in 
recent years, but in many ways, CMUs ac
quisition of governmental contracts it was 
inevitable. The steady build up of aiding 
and abetting the military-industrial com
plex has roots back to at least the 1940s, 
when two Carnegie Tech professors 
helped develop the fission bomb. In 1945, 
six engineers and scientists from Tech 
were also present to witness the first test 
of atomic weapons at Alamogordo, N.M.
Carnegie Mellon has witnessed the 
birth of the atomic age, the most destruc
tive chapter in the history of human mili
tary might. In following years, the Office 
of Naval Research began pushing its ad
dictive supply of research funding with 
the physics department; and later on, the 
Robotics Institute began readily accepting 
millions in funding. Similarly, we must 
not forget that the Software Engineer
ing Institute was built as the Pentagons 
Plan B in the event of a nuclear war.
Since then, a significant part of our 
university has been dedicated to a line of 
projects designed to bolster the lethality 
and survivability of our nations military.
Not all of them are considered evil; many 
of our current efforts are directly applica
ble to both military and non-military ap
plications, regardless of funding source. 
Examples include an effort to provide 
real-time language translation in a por
table format (the DARPA-funded Babylon 
project) and Red Teams autonomous offroad vehicles. These projects have many 
worthwhile and altruistic applications 
outside of the military. But this time, the 
school is crossing that hazy line of weap
ons research with Gladiator, the name of 
the gem we stole from Lockheed Martin. 
The projects sole reason for existing is to 
aid in killing. No matter how much Glad
iators advocates try to sugar-coat its pur
pose by saying its for reconnaissance, do 
not be fooled into thinking that it wont be 
compatible with more lethal armaments.
The industrious students doing under
graduate and graduate research are being 
directed closer and closer to military re
search, slowly transforming this campus 
into the next Los Alamos.
Students come to Carnegie Mellon to 
expand the frontiers of science, technol
ogy and the arts, not to design weapons 
of robotic destruction.
Maybe well see the following in the 
next Super Bowl commercial We get: 
Carnegie Mellon. We dont make the 
weapons you kill with; we make the 
weapons you kill with better.
Tartans for Israel 
distort Finkelstein
Tartans for Israels Rachel Svinkelstin 
seriously misrepresents the views of up
coming speaker Dr. Norman Finkelstein 
[Tensions between student interest 
groups heat up, 2/14].
Far from generalizing Holocaust 
survivors as thieves, Finkelstein  
himself the son of Holocaust survivors 
 argued in his The Holocaust Indus
try that agencies claiming to represent 
survivors in reparations suits have ex
ploited these survivors, misappropri
ating payments due them. This welldocumented study has been praised 
by the eminent Holocaust scholar Raul 
Hillberg.
However, Dr. Finkelsteins main 
academic interest is in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and it is on this topic that 
he will be speaking. He has a long his
tory of exposing the dishonest scholar
ship of hardline Zionists, from Joan Pe
ters (who in her From Time Immemorial 
absurdly claimed that Palestine was 
empty of Arab residents before Zionist 
colonization) to Alan Dershowitz 
(whose The Case for Israel was appar
ently partially plagiarized from From 
Time Immemorial).
Therein, I suspect, lays the real rea
son for Svinkelstins aversion to him.
People can and do draw different 
conclusions from the same facts. But no 
rational person can be exposed to the 
facts of the Palestine issue and logically 
reach the conclusions stubbornly clung 
to by groups like Tartans for Israel. So 
they do everything they can to keep 
people from hearing the facts, and they 
promulgate fiction.
When the above fails, they resort  
as Svinkelstin does  to innuendos of 
anti-Semitism even more spurious than 
those charges of Communist sympathy 
Sen. McCarthy leveled at his opponents 
five decades ago.
The title of Finkelsteins lecture, by 
the way, will be Beyond Chutzpah: On 
the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the 
Abuse of History. I invite Tartans for 
Israel to attend  and to actually listen 
this time.
Svinkelstin defames 
Abunimah, Finkelstein
Rachel Svinkelstin makes two very 
serious charges in her protest against 
permitting speakers for the Palestinian 
cause onto the CMU campus: that a 
lot of what [Ali Abunimah] said was 
lies and that Norman Finkelstein is 
guilty of generalizing Holocaust 
survivors as thieves. As someone who 
has read Norman Finkelsteins The 
Holocaust Industry and who attended 
Ali Abunimahs talks at CMU and the 
University of Pittsburgh I believe both 
these statements amount to defama
tion. Ms. Svinkelstin should either cite
actual statements by Mr. Abunimah that 
were manifestly untrue and the pas
sages in The Holocaust Industry that 
support her assertion, or admit to defa
mation and apologize in the pages of 
The Tartan.

Palestinians hope for 
mutual respect
I would like to thank the Editorial 
Board for its support in [Tar
tans for Israel fail to protest speak
ers in appropriate fashion, 2/14]. 
People often seem to forget that we 
are not fighting against Israel, but 
for Palestinian human rights (i.e., 
we are Students for Justice in Pal
estine). Rachel Svinkelstin said, 
There is a thin and dangerous line 
between anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish. 
Unfortunately, there has been a ten
dency recently to label any criticism 
of Israeli government policy as antiSemitism, which it is clearly not.
After his lecture, Ali Abunimah 
was called a liar and was accused 
of encouraging terrorism on the 
Israeli-Palestinian news site he 
co-founded, Electronic Intifada 
(electronicintifada.net). However, the 
accuser was not willing to show even 
one example of this, even after being 
invited to do so on the computer in 
front of the audience. Norman Finkel
stein  a speaker who has been post
poned despite the Universitys initial 
approval  is often called a Holocaust 
revisionist, in spite of overwhelm
ing support from Raul Hilberg, the 
worlds leading authority on the Nazi 
Holocaust. Svinkelstin claims that Fin
kelstein was who really [caused pain] 
because of his claims about Holocaust 
survivors and WWII restitution, even 
though Hilberg said in an interview, 
Finkelstein opened the discussion on 
this sad chapter. He is going in the right 
direction.
When Abunimah spoke here, he 
attended patiently to every question 
asked of him before the event ended. 
Those who didnt have a chance to ask 
their questions here at CMU could easily 
have gone to his second talk at the 
University of Pittsburgh (not a single 
one did). How can Svinkelstin accuse 
these speakers of not promoting healthy 
dialogue? And why (according to her) 
is Abunimahs support of a single-state 
solution to the conflict  the point of 
his talk  divisive?
I can only hope that when Tartans 
for Israel does finally bring its speaker 
or speakers here, students will notice 
our polite manners and above all else 
our lack of efforts to silence them. The 
recent actions of Tartans for Israel make 
their intentions unclear, but you can 
be sure we want dialogue, because we 
want justice.

Warfare changes in 
light of robotic soldier
This past week, Carnegie Mellon 
University announced that the National 
Robotics Engineering Consortium and 
United Defense Industries have been 
awarded a $26.4 million contract from 
the U.S. Department of Defense to 
design, develop and produce tactical 
unmanned ground vehicles (TUGVs) 
for the U.S. Marines.
To judge by the CMU press release, 
the merits of this project include the 
following: helping the U.S. government 
achieve its goal of having 1/3 of its 
military vehicles be unmanned by 2015; 
enabling the Marines to enhance battle
field capability by creating technology 
that functions as a force multiplier in 
order to increase survivability; and 
creating manufacturing jobs in western 
Pennsylvania.
Having lived in Pittsburgh for five 
years, I can certainly understand the 
need to create decent-paying jobs in 
the area. However, it is less clear to 
me that the first two objectives are 
achievements that members of Carnegie 
Mellon should be proud to trumpet. 
Unfortunately, the press release writers 
recourse to euphemisms and military 
jargon makes it difficult to evaluate the 
projects merits.
For example, we are told that the 
TUGV, a.k.a. Gladiator, is specially 
designed to increase human survival by 
neutralizing threats and reducing risk 
to Marines on the ground. Presumably 
human survival can be translated into 
fewer U.S. military deaths, but what 
about other humans, including civil
ians, caught in the crossfire? The press 
release further describes the TUGVs 
ability to detect threats, but is oddly 
silent about how the Gladiator will 
neutralize threats (i.e., kill people).
Fortunately, Pentagon officials 
are not as concerned with political 
correctness as most university officials. 
Gordon Johnson of the Joint Forces 
Command had this to say about robotic 
soldiers: Theyre not afraid.They dont 
forget their orders. They dont care if 
the guy next to them has just been 
shot. Mr. Johnson does not seem to be 
nearly as concerned about human sur
vival as he is about an efficient fighting 
force. (I should clarify that the Johnson 
quote from The New York Times was 
not made is specific reference to the 
Gladiator but in regards to the Defense 
Departments plan to invest billions of 
dollars in automated armed forces.)
Before Carnegie Mellon researchers/ 
entrepreneurs contribute additional 
innovations intended to remove what
ever shred of humanity remains in war
fare, I would urge university officials, 
faculty, staff, and students to engage 
in a frank discussion  uncluttered 
by euphemisms  about the social, 
economic, environmental, and human 
costs of warfare and the technologies 
used to wage it.

Shabazzs inflammatory lecture 
hinders constructive dialogue
Malik Zulu Shabazzs appearance on 
campus has been one of the most contro
versial and divisive events of the semester. 
The chairman of the New Black Panther 
Party, Shabazz came to campus on Thurs
day to deliver a speech that was supposed 
to focus on black history and the role of 
the black college student. Instead of fo
cusing on these topics, the majority of 
Shabazzs speech contained anti-Semitic, 
homophobic, and anti-miscegenation 
rhetoric. Furthermore, Shabazz singled 
out and lampooned individual students 
and denounced Carnegie Mellon and the 
city of Pittsburgh as a whole.
The content of Shabazzs speech, while 
certainly controversial, could hardly be 
considered a surprise. Student Senate had 
recognized Shabazzs anti-Semitic beliefs 
when Kierra Wright, a senior chemical 
engineering major, requested funding 
last month. Due to Shabazzs anti-Semitic 
views, Senate denied Wright the $2000 
honorarium she had requested. Wright 
then turned to SPIRIT, who co-sponsored 
and helped fund the event.
Although Shabazz delivered a speech 
that contained as much vitriolic hatred as 
his more vocal detractors had predicted, 
SPIRIT should not be criticized for invit
ing Shabazz in the first place. The orga
nization took a risk, hoping that Shabazz 
would deliver a positive speech about the 
role of black college students, as he had 
promised. But Shabazz could not resist 
from promulgating his hateful views and 
the speech was far from positive.
SPIRIT upheld its plan to bring a 
speaker who represented a unique opin
ion within the African-American com
munity: Shabazz and his viewpoints are 
undoubtedly different from mainstream 
opinion. His speech demonstrated the 
point that Professor Joe Trotter made to 
Student Senate: the African-American 
community is far from homogenous. Yet 
this was a costly point to make.
By inviting Shabazz, SPIRIT unleashed 
a threatening and unwarranted backlash, 
not only against themselves but against 
other black students on campus. Several 
African-American students have said that 
even though they did not agree with most 
of the opinions that Shabazz voiced, their 
mere association with SPIRIT has caused 
conflict with their friends and other stu
dents. Racial tensions have increased sub
stantially in Shabazzs wake.
SPIRIT has done a disservice to their 
organization and those whp believe 
in racial equality on this campus. By 
sponsoring an extremist who confused 
black empowerment with homophobia, 
anti-Semitism, and anti-miscegenation, 
SPIRIT has empowered its detractors. 
Those who feel that racism is not a prob
lem believe that Shabazzs absurdity con
firms their opinion. Yet during the back
lash, black members of this campus have 
been threatened, which shows that we 
still have racial issues to resolve.
The whole campus can and must learn 
from this debacle. Student organizations 
need to be more sensitive to how the 
rest of campus can react to their events. 
Student Senate recognized that Shabazz 
was too much of a liability to direct a 
special allocation of the activities fee to 
him. SPIRIT should have been able to see 
this coming as well, and better prepared 
themselves for this to happen.
In spite of all these warning signs, 
SPIRIT gambled on a controversial 
speaker and set back struggles on this 
campus for racial equality. How SPIRIT 
decides to make amends with the com
munity is their problem; Carnegie Mellon 
as a whole needs to work hard to move 
forward and not fall victim to the same 
racial stereotypes that this campus has 
sought to heal. This campus must choose 
between the divisive rhetoric of Shabazz 
and an encompassing notion of equality 
that includes all students.

We know you watch the Oscars for the designer outfits rather than the awards. Just for fun, we asked:A PERSONS OPINION
Compiled by Eno ThereskaWhat Oscar category, real or fake, would you be nominated for?
Response from SPIRIT
SPIRIT is writing to address the con
cerns of Attorney Malik Zulu Shabazzs 
lecture that took place on February 17, 
2005. The purpose of this lecture was to 
inform the community on black history, 
and more importantly, the significance 
of being an active, positive participant 
in the campus and the off-campus com
munity. Our intent was to give students 
the opportunity to hear and discuss views 
that might be controversial and differ
ent, yet still informative. After immense 
discussion with Student Affairs, Student 
Activities, CMAP, and Shabazz himself, 
SPIRIT had made the decision to continue 
with hosting the lecture. We understand 
that there are members of the campus 
community that have felt uncomfortable 
with Atty. Shabazzs appearance here on 
campus. SPIRIT would like to apologize to 
anyone who felt offended or disrespected 
by the lecture.
Secondly, SPIRIT would like to clar
ify the safety and security protocols that 
were implemented during the event this 
past Thursday. Operating under standard 
safety policies and the circumstances dur
ing the lecture, security was unable to 
admit all students who wanted to attend 
the event. Students were denied entrance 
into the lecture due to the limited capacity 
of the venue, seating reservations for the 
lectures sponsors, and fire code regula
tions. In addition, cameras were not per
missible and recording and photograph
ing the lecture was not allowed without 
prior authorization. Those in attendance, 
without proper authorization, were asked 
to put away their equipment, but were 
permitted to stay.
Finally, SPIRIT would like to say that 
Shabazzs views do not necessarily repre
sent the views of SPIRIT or of many black 
students in this campus community. We 
ask the campus community not to let the 
events on Thursday turn your back on the 
SPIRIT organization or any of its individ
ual members, but to find out more about 
our organization. We are an organization 
who promotes black culture on this cam
pus and we invite members of the campus 
community to any of our general body 
meetings, to find out about our partici
pation in booth, buggy, fashion show, or 
even ask a member of our general body or 
the e-board what SPIRIT is about and pro
vide any suggestions on how to strengthen 
the organization. We hope that anyones 
reaction to the event on Thursday can turn 
into something positive, and spark discus
sion on how to make Carnegie Mellon into 
a more understanding and compassionate 
community.
SPIRIT
Poor dialogue, good ideas
Attorney Shabazzs highly anticipated 
visit to campus lived up to its billing as a 
stimulating speech, while falling short of 
addressing the actual Role and Respon
sibility of the Black College Student. All 
the necessary theatrics were in place: 
impassioned speeches, intense audience 
involvement, and even dramatic lighting 
effects. But this all seemed to mask some 
of the derogatory comments made by the 
organization, and divert from the pro
posed topic.
As I read from the issues page of the 
New Black Panther Party (NBPP)s web
site, I couldnt help but be disappointed 
at the derogatory language used against 
white Americans, as well as influential 
black leaders. The piece titled The God
damn White Man (www.newblackpanther.com/crackers.html) reads as the 
NBPPs list of the most vile leaders of the 
white community (while also address
ing whites from all corners of the United 
States). Though many of the troubles that 
the NBPP has with those listed may have 
some factual backing, this is lost and ig
nored by many because of the crude lan
guage and amateurish presentation. Why

The number one enemies of Christ were 
scribes. If they were responsible for kill
ing Christ, what chance does little oP me 
have? In addition to dabbling with con
spiracy theories about the Jewish role in 
September 11th, Shabazz stated at a press 
conference on C-SPAN that We have to 
make it plain that Zionists control Amer
ica, lock stock and barrel... the European 
Jews have America under control, lock, 
stock, and barrel  the media, foreign 
policy. Sadly, students at CMU no longer 
need to search out Shabazz quotations on 
the Internet. When I attended his talk, I 
had the pleasure of hearing him hawking 
classic anti-Semitic books often favored by 
white supremacist such as Henry Fords 
The International Jew  The Worlds 
Foremost Problem. Among the many rac
ist highlights, Shabazz accused Jews of 
controlling the slave trade, claimed Jews 
are dishonest, and threatened a Jewish 
student by name. Most disturbingly, the 
crowd  which was composed largely of 
African Americans and Muslims  greeted 
these diatribes with a mixture of clapping, 
shouts of black power, and indifferent si
lence. The choice of Shabazz as a speaker 
is baffling, particularly for an organization 
whose members should know firsthand 
about the meaning of racism.
Shortly after the Shabazz event, mem
bers of the Muslim Students Association, 
Students for Peace and Justice in Pales
tine, and the Palestine Solidarity Com
mittee intend to bring Norman Finkelstein to campus. Finkelstein is a marginal 
academic who built his reputation writing 
such books as The Holocaust Industry, 
which expose how Jews cynically ex
ploit the memory of their genocide as part 
of a money-making blackmail scheme. 
In a typical example, he refers to Nobel 
Prize winning author and Auschwitz sur
vivor Elie Wiesel as the resident clown of 
the Holocaust circus. The problem with 
such statements is that for many Jewish 
students on campus, the Holocaust is not 
a circus or a cheap political point; it is 
personal. Our exposure to the Holocaust 
was not through casually reading Night 
or watching Schindlers List. We heard 
about it from our grandparents who sur
vived this genocide, from our aunts and 
uncles who experienced the horror as chil
dren, and from large collections of blackand-white photographs depicting family 
members we will never meet. Finkelsteins 
University-sponsored talk will address the 
alleged cynical exploitation of anti-Semi
tism, a subject that seems particularly 
hurtful in light of the Shabazz event.
Less offensive choices could easily have 
been made to further whatever political 
aims both groups may have  including a 
critique of Israeli policies. And yet, these 
highly offensive speakers were sought out 
instead. Why would a minority organiza
tion bring in a noted racist who targets an
other minority to speak to campus? Why 
would students from a religious minority 
seek to bring in a speaker whose work 
seeks to trivialize the suffering of another 
religious minority? Perhaps under a strict, 
legalistic freedom of speech definition, 
all people  even racists  should be al
lowed to express their views on college 
campuses. Yet intuitively, we know that 
some speech promotes hate, insensitiv
ity, and intolerance, and thus should not 
be welcomed in a university community 
because of the climate it creates. One 
example is verbal sexual harassment, 
which colleges do not allow even though 
it technically could be considered free 
speech. In the end, however, universi
ties should not have to expressly forbid 
racist or bigoted speech. It is the respon
sibility of students who are engaged in 
political activism to weigh the morality 
and consequences of their actions. If they 
dont, they tell us more about themselves 
than the speakers they choose to bring to 
campus.

say these things when you believe the facts 
are in your favor? Mr. Shabazz, an intel
ligent man and proficient speaker, was 
smart enough not to use this kind of lan
guage at his speech, but as a representa
tive of the NBPP, still bears responsibility 
for this rhetoric. Although it may be ca
thartic to express such feelings, they only 
go to lessen the overall credibility of the 
organization.
I went to this meeting with an open 
mind, hoping to hear some plan of action 
for the black college student. Sadly, this 
was only addressed directly in the last 30 
seconds of a two-hour speech. Instead I 
got a sensationalized view of the facts of 
history. Knowing history is an important
part of making plans for the future, but to 
emphasize it to this extent was unneces
sary, as there are many issues of today that 
need to be addressed. I hope Mr. Shabazz 
can come back to our campus to share his 
thoughts on those topics.
There was also much talk about unity, 
but not the unity Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. had envisioned. It is a unity among 
black people to build up their own world 
and not stray too far into enemy terri
tory. This view goes to segregate blacks 
more in society, instead of forming any 
sort of bond or respect from other races.
As Dr. Cornel West says in Race Mat
ters, this kind of black leadership is not 
only symptomatic of black alienation 
and desperation ... it also reinforces the 
fragmentation of U.S. progressive efforts 
that could reverse this deplorable plight. 
In this way, black leaders often inadver
tently contribute to the very impasse they 
are trying to overcome (The Crisis of Black 
Leadership, page 68).
Mr. Shabazz has the power to make 
great change in the black community, and 
I respect his efforts in this area, as I pursue 
many of the same goals. I just hope that 
we can deal with the real issues of today,
and formulate some plan of action for the
future that will help the black community 
progress to its potential.

Imagine that our University decided 
to host two controversial speakers in the 
course of a month. The first speaker spe
cializes in African Americans cynical ex
ploitation of their history of slavery for 
political and economic gain. The second
speaker is a noted racist whose public 
speaking engagements often include bla
tantly bigoted statements about African 
Americans. Most people  myself in
cluded  would agree that the University 
should not lend financial or logistical sup
port to such speakers. Moreover, student 
organizations on campus should have the 
sensitivity and intelligence to avoid seek
ing out such speakers. Unfortunately, a 
comparable situation now faces Jewish 
students at Carnegie Mellon University.
This past Thursday, SPIRIT hosted the 
head of the New Black Panther Party, Ma
lik Zulu Shabazz. Rather than describe 
Shabazz, who is also a former spokesman 
for the Nation of Islam, it is best to give a 
small sample of his oratory. During a pro
test in front of the Bnai Brith building 
in Washington, D.C., on April 20, 2002, 
Shabazz led chants of death to Israel 
and the white man is the devil. At the 
National Press Club in October of 2001, 
Shabazz also said, Kill every goddamn 
Zionist in Israel! Goddamn little babies, 
goddamn old ladies! Blow up Zionist su
permarkets! At a rally in Austin, Texas in 
October 1997, Shabazz harangued a white 
reporter: He is a scribe, a Jewish writer.

Not all black students appropriately represented by campus organizations
_______________Franklin Williams
Recently Malik Zulu Shabazz 
was invited to come speak on 
campus at the request of SPIRIT. 
While I have no qualms about 
inviting controversial speakers to 
campus, I believe that the issues 
which have recently occurred 
within SPIRIT are a product of a 
deeper issue.
Cultural organizations around 
campus enrich the multicultural 
aspect of Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity and provide an overall 
positive experience for those 
involved. However, I feel as if 
SPIRIT has taken the idea of mul
ticultural awareness on campus 
and turned it upside down.
As a black member of the 
community, I feel inadequately 
represented by this organization 
that claims to represent the black 
community. Too many times have 
I heard The black community 
feels... while in actuality, many 
members of the black community 
who are not active in or disagree 
with SPIRIT are ignored. I feel that 
the recent lecture displays this.
Malik Zulu Shabazz is known 
by many as an anti-Semite and 
a racist who believes that blacks 
deserve more power than whites 
because of social and genetic fac
tors. While I personally disagree 
with him, I have no problem with 
SPIRIT choosing to bring him
here  but I think the process in 
which they decided this course of 
events was poor.
When a black member of the 
community was turned down 
by Student Senate for funding, 
she ignored the decision of Sen
ate and approached SPIRIT for 
funds. Senates decision was fur
ther ignored by SPIRIT when they 
offered the funds for the speaker, 
and Shabazz was invited. The re
sult? Something which I, a black
member of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, feel was completely 
outlandish and am personally of
fended by.
This is one example out of many. 
Last year when the issue of The 
Tartan, known as the Natrat, was 
published, I was the only black 
member of The Tartans Editorial 
Staff. On numerous occasions, 
my presence was explicitly 
ignored. More frequently than I 
can remember I heard There are 
no black members on your staff! 
and Youre all racists!
When I considered standing to
protest and make my existence 
known, another black writer 
for the paper stood and spoke, 
stating the good things existing 
in the paper. He was immediately 
called an Uncle Tom and told that 
clearly he wasnt black enough 
to be really black. I started to re
alize that these key organizations 
which were representing blacks 
in the University could not and 
would not give a full represen
tation when it did not fit their
agenda.
What struck me as bizarre, 
though, was the underlying 
hypocrisy which seemed to be 
pouring out of SPIRIT. A few days 
after the Natrat incident, the 
SPIRIT Fashion Show took place. 
I can completely understand a 
group of people being upset at ra
cial epithets being uttered, partic
ularly in public forums. What I do 
not condone is when a few days 
after SPIRIT complained so ada
mantly and publicly about the Nword being used, they opened 
up their fashion show with a song
littered with the very same word.
Im not one to be bothered 
or upset very often, and racial 
slurs are something that I have 
grown up understanding; but 
this pushed me over the edge, 
forcing me to immediately walk 
out of the show. I realized that in 
this case, SPIRIT seemed to deem 
derogatory words offensive only 
when spoken by certain people
 those who are not members 
of the black community. I would
hope that in the future, the 
administration of SPIRIT would 
realize that this distinction is not 
theirs to make, and that the level 
of offensiveness in the word does 
not change based on by whom it 
is uttered.
I think my largest qualm is 
when it comes to racism. Al
though not publicly stated, there 
have been many occasions where 
both myself and others have heard 
members of SPIRIT refer to other 
people and other organizations as 
racist. When Senate declined to 
give money, one of the resound
ing comments from SPIRIT to 
Senate was that Senate was full 
of racists and that they refused to 
give them money because of it.
In terms of the Natrat, people 
refused to believe that there could 
be any possible other explanation 
for what happened other than 
that The Tartan was full of rac
ists. We apologized profusely for 
the issue, and the staff genuinely 
meant it. It was a mistake gone 
awry, and the comic was not sup
posed to be run. But, of course, 
the only possible outcome was 
racism  that we were all racists 
and did this with racist intent. I 
have become convinced that this 
is part of the reason I was ignored 
as a member of the Editorial Staff. 
It is much easier to accuse an en
tire staff of racism if there are no 
black members on its staff.
I feel that SPIRIT needs to learn 
from the other organizations on 
campus. There are multitudes of 
other organizations on campus 
that have been oppressed or hurt 
in some way, but deal with these
issues constructively. It seems to 
me that in this case, with Shabazz 
as a prime example, SPIRIT is mov
ing away from understanding and 
valuing their cultural differences 
and more towards devaluing 
other differences in order to bring 
theirs more into the forefront.
I value SPIRIT for its work as an 
organization, but I feel that it in 
no way expresses the resounding 
opinion of the Carnegie Mellon 
black community. I would ap
preciate it if SPIRIT would stop 
referring to itself as the voice of 
these students and realize that, in 
fact, they exclude many members 
of the black community. Contro
versy is fine until it starts to inflict 
pain on others. Right now I feel 
that I have been hurt, as well as 
many of my friends who may or 
may not share racial or cultural 
similarities with me.
I urge the members of SPIRIT 
to think critically about what they 
do in the future and consider seri
ously the direction in which they 
are taking their organization. I 
look forward to seeing changes 
and for the hopeful realization 
that they have a lot to give to the 
community, once they figure out 
how to appropriately do so.

We thank the God for every one 
that spoke on the platform. I 
was... to come here to give a in
nocent speech (from audience: 
Go ahead), I was to come here 
to speak to my people  (Thats 
right!), to the sisters and broth
ers... and others... (Thats 
right!) who are here. We are 
happy that youre here. If you got 
some more outside, bring 'em in! 
Dont stand outside and jump up 
and down and throw a temper 
tantrum, come on in! This is sup
posed to be a college campus. This 
is supposed to be where the diver

and discussed  and personally 
Im disgusted! I am shocked and 
appalled at prestigious Carnegie 
Mellon University. They try to 
crush free speech! (callback: 
Thats right!) They try to crush 
free speech! (callback) Because 
they dont want you to know the 
truth! (loud applause)
7:04
We fought for these Constitu
tional rights; they were not given 
to us. There is not one Constitu
tional amendment, not one Con
stitutional right, that was given 
to us by white people, for it was 
the blood of [Marliss?], it was the 
blood of Dr. King, the blood of 
Medgar Evers, the blood and the 
struggle of Fannie Lou Hamer, the 
blood and the struggle of Emmett 
Till that gave their lives so that we 
may have some of the rights that 
we have fought, bled, and died 
for. In every war. And through 
the 400 years of our holocaust, 
we have been given  Nothing! 
What we have attained is on the 
basis of struggle. So I dont come 
to thank you tonight (Loud: Yes 
sir!) for your constitution. I dont 
thank you for giving me some 
right of free speech  you tried 
to crush that right!
9:08
I thank God and the ancestors... 
for that right. You cut my money! 
You took to the student council 
and the student government and 
you collaborated to conspire to 
cut my money, thinkin that that 
would stop our coming here to
night. (Loud applause.) Youre 
so arrogant! Youre so arrogant 
that you believe that you have 
full control over your Negroes on 
campus! The nerve of you, during 
this Black History Month to try to 
interfere with our learning our 
history after you have robbed and 
destroyed us. (Loud applause.)
Hawkins, Christopher Columbus, 
our contact in black history we 
have been consistently dogged by 
white folks. Is that right? (TR. Let 
the church say amen. Amen!) 
Let the church say amen. (Amen!) 
Let the church say amen again. 
(Amen!) Now lets clear this up 
first. Since they say Im a racist, a 
hater, and an anti-Semite, let me 
try to offer you a few points on 
who I really am. Since my char
acter has been defamed. That 
they didnt tell you that Im also 
a practicin attorney at law. They 
didnt tell you that Ive fought 
some important Constitutional 
victories over ol Rudy Giuliani
Escorted at every step by security personnel, Malik Zulu Shabazz was driven away after his almost-three-hour speech.
foot tonight. I didnt come to play 
around, I didnt come to beat 
around the bush, I didnt come to 
lighten up. I came to tighten up. 
(Applause.) Dont take me out of 
context. I didnt come to pin the 
tail on the donkey, I came to pin 
the tail on the racist honky! (ap
plause) ...at Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity. Thats right! I dont come 
to spare, I dont come to take no 
prisoners. Diversity!
11:57
Bring the president of the Univer
sity in here, and lets sit down and 
dispute what we have to say.
12:08
You say: Malik Zulu Shabazz is 
a racist. Malik Zulu Shabazz is a 
anti-Semite. Malik Zulu Shabazz 
is a violent man or a hate-monger. 
You probably thought you were 
coming in here to see some kind 
of wild-eyed monster.
12:43 The lights go out.
(Unidentified male voice: Get 
the goddamn lights on. [...] Get
talk) Well get the lights fixed. You 
just stay right here and Im gonna 
continue on with my lecture. [...] 
They want you to get frightened 
and leave.
16:12
Brothers and sisters: Black Power! 
Black Power! Let me continue on. 
Let me continue on, cause I aint 
afraid! I aint afraid. This reminds 
me of a slave ship. This reminds 
how we were packed and stacked 
and brought to the hells of Amer
ica. In chains. Imagine yourself 
right now as if you were in a slave 
ship, at the bottom of a slave ship 
crossing the Atlantic. What is all 
of this fuss about? (Aside:) And 
get dem damn lights on. Theres 
gonna be a problem on this cam
pus tonight.
17:34
This is good, this is going out 
all over the city. All of the me
dia can show what a racist town 
Pittsburgh really is! (long ap
plause) Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh 
is racist as hell! And the racism at 
Carnegie Mellon University drips
Its the Black Panther Party. We 
aint scared. So let me say this 
now: (mike noises) Now I might 
have to change again. My subject 
was supposed to be the role and 
responsibility of the black college 
student. So now it has to be the 
role and responsibilityrole and 
responsibility of the black college 
student, in the reality of white 
racism, (applause)
19:56
They come here tonight  the 
nerve of them! Stick to the sub
ject! (Audience chatter.)
[Shabazz, far from microphone] 
The arrogance of these people! 
How the hell could I talk about 
black history without talk about 
the white mans negativity [...] 
Ever since we have come into con
tact with the white man. These 
are facts, now. Whenever we have 
come into contact with the Eu
ropean, be it 6000 years ago in 
Kenya with the Hyksos invasion, 
or whether it was with the Greeks 
and Alexander the Not-So-Great, 
huh? Or whether it was all John
You think that by denying us, 
by denying me, your little funky 
two thousand dollars (applause, 
crosstalk) Ill let you know that 
now  Ill come here and fight 
you for free! (Loud applause.) 
Cause Im a freedom fighter! Ill 
fight you for free! Its an honor to 
do battle with those who are try
ing to stop our rise.
10:40

laughter.) Huh? Jumpin up and

further. Uh, I didnt come to duck 
tonight. I didnt come to pussydem lights on! [...] Put them 
damn lights on, honkies!)
14:09
Listen to me. Listen to what I am 
saying. Brothers and sisters, this 
is wonderful. This is the best ex
ample that we could have tonight 
of white racism. This is the best 
chance we have to actually dur
ing this Black History Month
 Gimme some room  to re
live what our ancestors relived. 
(There you go!) Well get the 
lights; they turning off the lights 
because the light has come. Dont 
go anywhere! (applause, crossto the core of this university. With 
all of this stolen money up in here. 
Money that you got, rooted in the 
exploitation of black people. And 
financin wars abroad.
18:39
Hold tight! Hold tight! Youre not 
making me no less determined.

Million Youth March to succeed. 
They didnt want us to march in 
the streets of New York, we had

that the National Bar Association, 
the largest group of black lawyers 
anywhere in the country, voted

plause) Now? They didnt tell you 
that Im the spokesman also and

things about the New Black Pan

They didnt tell you how we go

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 21, 2005Ail
Transcript Excerpts The Malik Zulu Shabazz Lecture
They are master manipulators. 
And they are master deceivers. 
They take you out of context and 
mischaracterize you. And they try 
to make it seem like Im an evil 
man, and Im not an evil man. 
They try to make it seem like Im a 
racist and Im not a racist, I cannot 
BE a racist. All I am, all we are is 
victims of racism.
33:39
Look. Lets go over this. The (sing
song) Declaration of Unity. 
(bitter) The Declaration of 
Unity! By Rachel Savinsky... Savinkle-stinn. Lets listen to it and 
see if it makes sense to us. This 
is supposed to be the demonstra
tion that took place outside, with 
them and the other blacks; I dont 
know how many were there: I saw 
a couple on the news. It says We 
will be standing together across 
all boundaries of faith, color, na
tionality, and sexual orientation, 
to say loudly and proudly that 
we all support and have respect 
for one another. That musta 
just happened today, (applause, 
crosschatter) Cause from what I 
heard, it aint no respect for our 
people on this campus. (TR) That 
the racism is all interwoven in the 
walk of Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity. ... They want you to learn, but 
only learn what they want you to 
learn! Study, but only study what 
they want you to study! Go some
where, but only go where they 
want you to go!
36:15
My sisters, my brothers, let us 
reason together, from a member 
of your family. Racism existed 
before I got here, (loud applause) 
Racism is a reality in American 
life and all over the planet. And 
then you try to come in here and 
act to tell me that Im the cause of 
racism? You got a hell of a nerve, 
buddy. You got a hell of a nerve.
... Let me be clear  fore I go 
any further  that Im for the 
black man on this campus stand
ing with his black woman. (Loud 
applause.) I dont believe that the 
black woman like some of these 
rap songs be sayin, is an itch with 
the B in front of it. I dont believe 
shes a whore: I know shes the 
queen of the planet! I know that 
shes the mother of civilization!
I know that she is the goddess of 
the Universe! So dont let me see 
you out here with Rachel, Susie or 
Karen or Kathy. Our black women 
need you, black man. Our black 
women need you, God! But they 
will try to act because you a have 
date, or have a lunch, or they give 
you a few little trinkets or tokens, 
that you sposed to be happy. 
(Uh-huh!) Sometimes they so ar
rogant and racist they dont even 
see it themselves! They will get 
along with us as long as they on 
the top and we on the bottom. As 
long as they in control and we are 
under their control, everythings 
all right! But as soon as we start 
risin up, aah, they come out and 
turn the lights out, and go crazy! 
(Applause.)
39:27
To the members of the Arab Stu
dent Association, you got an ally 
here. I come with the facts. (Ap
plause.) I dont come with the 
slander, I dont even have to call 
your names, I just come with the 
facts. So dont come out here and 
say I called you a cracker  I 
didnt call you a cracker. I didnt 
do it. Dont say I called you a 
beast, I called you a devil, I did 
none of that! I just come with the 
facts! The facts is enuff tonight!)
45:03
Im still on the topic! Black his
tory! But I gotta deal with the 
lies against black history. So we 
are again the original people on 
the planet Earth. Our genes are 
dominant, white genes are re
cessive. A black man and a black 
woman can produce brown. You 
can produce red, queen! You can 
produce yellow! You can produce 
white and something thats whiter 
than white, a hundred and eighty 
degrees opposite in either direc
tion! (applause) But if Bob and 
Jill  if Bob and Jill get together,
they can do it all day, all night
 they can produce nothing but 
a little white baby. [...] Lets talk 
civilization now. Dispute me if Im 
wrong. If Im wrong Ill sit down. 
Black Lets talk about civili
zation. You say okay, you may 
be the original people but the 
Greeks started civilization. Ohh... 
And then they come and give you 
Charlton Heston on TV as Moses. 
Is that right? A blond-haired, 
white-skinned Moses. They give 
you Elizabeth Taylor as the anc 
ancient Egyptians. Huh? ... Egyp
tians were black. And the original 
name of Egypt is called Khemet.
48:34
The first modern marvels of 
architecture, science, and 
engineeringand they still dont 
know how the Pyramids were 
built today. While the Greek ruins 
are fallen down and Greece fallen
in the rubble, the Pyramids are 
standing strong. Built by Africans! 
Built by black people!... Im talkin 
about Queen Hatshepsut, huh? 
Im talkin about great kings and 
queens from Khemet... We are 
the original people of the planet! 
Look to the students of the Torah! 
And those from Hillel. You try to 
teach us that civilization started 
with Adam and Eve. That Adam 
and Eve were the first man, and 
Adam and Eve are 6000 years old. 
Well, I ask you if the first man and 
the first woman are 6000 years 
old, then how could we have been 
building cities in Khemet and in 
Africa back in 10,000 BC, 12,000 
BC? (applause)... Theres been 
a plan to lie, and to deceive us, 
and to make us feel like they are 
supreme and that we are inferior. 
And they know tonight that the 
hopes is over. Black Power! (BP)
52:17
You are the origin of ethics. You 
are the origin of religion and 
spiritual teaching. Most of the 
teachings that come up out of the 
Bible have a root in ancient Af
rica. In all due respect I have love, 
again, for the Black Messiah, the 
Black Jesus of the Scripture, but 
if youre gonna talk about a virgin 
birth, if youre gonna talk about 
a virgin birth did you know that 
two thousand years, ah, thou
sands of years, much more than 
two thousand, thousands of years 
before the birth, the virgin birth 
of Mary and Jesus, we had Asah 
and Aset, Isis and Osiris?... All of 
their origin  in Africa! This is 
Black History Month! You have 
no need to ever again as black 
man and black woman limit your
self to being a Crip, limit yourself 
to being a Blood, limit yourself to 
being a thug. No way you should 
walk around on this campus with 
your head down knowing that 
you are the mother and father of 
it all. Now.
56:38
In the Bible. Fore we move on to
the slavery period. The Jews say 
they have been our friends. And 
Rachel says shes been our friend, 
right? And that weve had such 
peaceful and good relations up 
to this point, and Malik Shabazz 
is cornin to disturb all that. How 
many of you have heard of the 
Hamitic Myth? How many of you 
have heard of the  have heard 
of the teaching that black people 
are the cursed seed of Haman? 
Hm? The Hamitic myth, or the 
teaching that black people are 
the cursed seed of Haman and 
Cain, was used as a pretext and 
a justification for the black holo
caust or the Maaya... Look! Lets 
go to the Talmud, which is one of 
the Jewish quote-unquote holy 
books. Lets go to the Talmud and 
see what the Talmud says about 
black people. And lets see how
the Jewish rabbis and st and 
sages set the stage for the Afri
can holocaust by putting forth 
the doctrine and the writing that 
black people are cursed. You with 
me? Hm?
1:00:00
Now to be honest... they say we 
shamefully elongated, but aint 
too many black men who think 
shame. Pardon the humor, but this 
is an academic setting. (Come on 
brother, come on brother.) This 
is an academic setting. Lets take it 
a little further. Lets take it a little 
further. Zionism! ... The original 
Semites who speak the Arabic, 
the Amharic, or the Gis languages 
are from northeast Africa. But the 
people you see in Israel today are 
not the true original Jews, they 
are from Europe! (Thats right! 
Applause.) They are the Ashkenazis or facts. Quote me, Im quot
ing facts. [...] They teach you that 
they gave you civilization, and 
you gave them civilization. When 
you were building palaces and 
pyramids, they were eatin their 
meat raw.
1:08:42
How can you be a Jew and say 
you a Zionist? How can you be 
a Jew and participate in the tak
ing of another peoples land? And 
what  and ripping them off of 
their land and killing them on 
their land. They just buldoze the 
houses! Drove them off the land 
and today they say they dont even 
have the right to return. (Think 
about these things.) But Im the 
racist? Im the anti-Semite? Oh, 
by the way the Palestinians are 
a Semitic people. Just in case we 
may have forgot through all the 
dialogue, the Palestinians are a 
Semitic people. [...] The blood 
of the Palestinians on the hands 
of the Zionists drips all the way 
down into the core of the planet 
Earth  I got to stand with the 
Palestinians. (Loud cheers, ap
plause.)
1:10:02
The state of Israel was taken by 
criminal means. The state of 
Israel was set up by illegal means, 
you cannot come to me and jus
tify it under international law. It 
has no standing under interna
tional law  It is an illegal state! 
It was set  I dont care what ne
gotiations are go in on! Its only 
a negotiation by force. Its only a 
negotiation between the occupier 
and the occupied. And now the 
Palestinians are forced to try and 
broker a deal because they got 
guns to their head, bulldozers. 
Black Power? Zionism is racism. 
[...] I dont blame Hamas. I dont 
blame Hezbollah. I dont blame 
Islamic Jihad, they were throwin 
rocks and after they got killed so 
much and saw their mothers and 
their babies bein killed they just 
said the hell with it, they gonna 
use by any means necessary 
to win their freedom and their 
liberation. I dont blame the vic
tim. Palestinians are the victim 
and they only responding to a 
white racist oppression in Pales
tine.
1:14:19
Who dropped the first nuclear 
bomb? Who? (Come on, yall.)
Forgot about World War Two? 
Who dropped the first nuclear 
bomb? Huh? (Mixed response: 
United States! Israel!) Iraq. 
Iraq. Iraq. Im a freedom fighter. 
The passion comes from me 
comes from the love for my people 
and the pain and suffering that I 
endured  that pain is my pain. 
The Muslim pain, the Palestinian 
pain, is my pain. Huh? Racism. We 
live in a world of racism, a world 
of a double standard. Look. They 
came here  Look at this. Look 
at these sick cartoons that they 
wrote on campus. They got me 
in one. Talking about... blowjobs, 
and Malik Shabazz... this is a  is 
this a campus newspaper? (Yes it 
is! Yes it is!) This is on campus! 
But I cant speak, right? But you 
got me in here, insulting the hell 
out of every black student here,
the other one I got openly talks 
about niggers, is that right? (Yes! 
Yes it does!) Openly talk about 
niggers, right here in the cam
pus uh... newspapers! And they 
dogged me hard, like I didnt give 
you credit, you hit me hard. Put 
up with your deviant sick sexual 
psychopathic... (Loud applause.) 
You so righteous, right? They so 
righteous, but they come but they
 but Meyer Lansky and the boys 
run liquor and alcohol. Right? 
(Right, right.) And theyre purvey
ors of pornographic magazines 
and all this smut and slut you see 
around... you know whos behind 
it? (Expose the devil!) You just 
didnt fight fair so you had to get 
sick and sexual with me. Ill tell 
you where the origin of all sexual 
sicknesses come from. (Go ahead. 
Go ahead.) If you ask me, in the 
question and answer session. 
(Laughter.) Look. Look, man, the 
state of Israel is a terrorist state.. 
[...] And tonight is an exercise 
in us repairing ourselves. Lets 
go quickly to the slave trade and 
then Ill open it up, Ill I wanna
 I wanna (Teach! Teach us!) 
take questions. Yall all right with 
me? (Yes sir!) Yall mad with me? 
(Applause.) Am I a racist? (No 
sir!) Am I a hater? (No sir!) Am I 
an anti-Semite? (No sir!) United 
States slavery. Huh? Who is the 
real racist, man? Huh? Who is 
the real anti-Semite? (The white 
man!) Would lynch black people. 
This is the  This is not just slav
ery, up until the 1940s, the 1950s, 
a favorite habit of theirs is to take 
a black man and take a rope and 
wrap it around his neck and hang 
him from a tree. Our holocaust 
did not last six years (No sir!), our 
holocaust did not last 12 years, 
you talkin about a 400-year 
Holocaust! For it is in the Bible 
that we would be in bondage for 
400 years, I say to you again, that 
we are the true children of the 
people of God. We are the only 
ones who have been in a land 
that is not our own for 400 years 
(TR) stripped of our name our 
language our religion and culture 
and our god. Huh? Castrate the
black man! Take the black man, 
cut his genitals off! Take the geni
tals, ram it in his mouth, and light 
the black man on fire! And they 
sit around eating popcorn and 
laughin about it! huh? Havin 
picnic, which really comes from 
the origin pick-a-nigger. Picnic 
comes from the origin pick-a-nigger! Pick a nigger to lynch and go 
an get some food and popcorn 
and laugh about it! No genuine 
human being could lynch another 
human being without just cause 
and sit around and laugh and 
smile and eat popcorn about it. 
Huh? No human being (TR) talk 
to me about a hundred  you say 
you lost six million  we lost over 
a hundred and fifty million in the 
Middle Passage and on both sides 
of the Atlantic! (Think about 
that.) One hundred and fifty mil
lion! (Applause.) Drowned in 
the Atlantic. Hundreds of years, 
drowned in the Atlantic, killed in 
Africa. Killed over here in Amer
ica. You say youre gonna go on 
and be a Rhodes Scholar. Old 
Cecil Rhodes went into what he 
called Rhodesia in Southern Af
rica killing black people all over 
Africa. Millions of black people 
killed in Rhodesia. Millions of 
them killed in Southern Africa, 
whats called Millons of them 
killed in the Congo at the hands 
of white racist white supremacist 
white colonialist white British 
French imperialist  Whos the 
real racist?
1:20:45
Huh? Talk to me about Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. Talk to me about 
Rosewood. Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
You say black people, they cant
 they cant build nothin. They 
cant build no economic plan. 
Tlilsa Oklahoma how many are 
familiar? (Black Wall Street.) This 
is not in your history books. Tulsa 
Tokla Oklahoma we had Black 
Wall Street. (TR) We had black 
businesses. We had black banks
 at that time in the 20s it was 
worth over 30 million dollars! Put 
that in the context of modern dol
lars and add interest  we had 
a black economic empire, stores,
grocery stores, banks, uh... credit 
unions, we were then that we had 
a black empire! We were victims 
of segregation but we were mak
ing it on our own, (TR) but the 
white man of Oklahoma couldnt 
stand it. He couldnt stand to 
see us progressin so they went 
into Tulsa, Oklahoma, and they 
burned the whole town down. 
And any black men they could 
find, they took black men and
strung em up, hung em all over 
Tulsa, Oklahoma. They burned 
our banks. They burned our 
farms, they burned our credit 
union, they burned everything 
down black men to hell. You 
tellin me Im supposed to come 
here (Come on brother, come on! 
Applause.) They destroyed Tulsa 
Oklahoma and sent a sign all 
over the nation that if you niggers 
build anything well burn it to the 
ground. (TR) Chicago riots, 1919. 
Blacks making progress in Chi
cago, white folks just rose up and 
started killing all blacks all over 
Chicago. (TR) Right after World 
War I. Black men lynched, in uni
form. Black men hung in uniform. 
Hm? Whos the real racist?
1:22:44
Look. Look. I got a defense for you, 
black man. (Go ahead. Teach.) 
Look at what you been through, 
man. I know you ready to give 
up. But I dont want you to give 
up so far when you start going to 
each other. [...] The black man to 
them has always been a threat, 
and they get joy out of hanging 
the black man. They get joy out 
of either physically hanging you, 
or they get joy out of mentally 
and politically hanging you. Like 
they tryin to hang me  like they
tried to hang Minister Farrakhan. 
They try to hang Khallid Moham
med. But we say greater is he 
that is in us than he who is in the 
world. (Applause, BP) The Nation 
of Islam is alive and well. And the 
Black Panther Party is alive and 
well. The Palestinian struggle is 
alive and well. The pan-African 
struggle is alive and well. They did 
not stop the truth! Truth crushed 
to the earth shall rise. Ohh, as 
much as we been through, we still 
got the spirit. God is with us, for 
we are the very people of God. 
Look at our clothes. They teach 
you lies. George Washington was 
the father of our country. Thomas 
Jefferson was the father of our 
country. Christopher Columbus 
discovered America in 1492. Is 
that what they teach? (Thats 
what they teach.) Is that what 
they teach at Carnegie Mellon 
University? Oh, but I know a dif
ferent Christopher Columbus. I 
know a different George Wash
ington. I know a different Thomas 
Jefferson. I know a Christopher 
Columbus that came to the West 
Indies or the Caribbean and 
wiped out the Arawak Indians! 
(Applause.) I... know a Christo
pher Columbus who came and 
began the holocaust of the Indi
ans they wiped out  Im talking 
about white folks. Wiped out 90 
percent of the Indians in America, 
lied to the Indians over and over 
again, broke treaties killed and 
murdered 80 or 90 percent of the 
Indians  straight-up genocide. 
Whos the racist? (They are!) And 
I gotta control my speech? I gotta 
stick to the topic?
1:25:38
George Washington! What about 
the George Washington that 
raped black women? What about 
the George Washington that had 
as many slaves as are sitting in 
this room? George Washington 
was a hypocrite, claiming a coun
try thats free for all and at the 
same time tradin black men and 
women like a keg of molaskus  
a keg of molasses  a chicken or 
a keg of whisky. (TR) 01 Thomas 
Jefferson, old wooden-teethwearin, ol wig-wearin Thomas 
Jefferson, nothin but a owner of 
slaves, a slave-master, an Indiankiller. Andrew Jackson! Indian 
killers, slave traders, slave own
ers! Aint no white folks in here 
named Washington! (TR Think 
about that.) Huh? Aint no white 
people in here named Wash
ington! Aint no Washingtons in 
here, use your black cherry tree 
the ol George was choppin down
was the black woman. And thats 
why you Rallou Washington. 
Tanniquah Washington. Huh? 
(Laughter, applause.) You never 
seen no Bob Washington! Jeremy 
Washington! Indian-killers and 
slave-owners, when are we gon 
get some truth? Huh? (TR) They 
killed Medgar Evers. Shot him 
down like a dog when all he was 
tryin to do was get the right to 
vote. They killed King! (TR) Mar
tin Luther King, tried the best he 
could, to love white people. And 
even went out and said that the 
white man was his brother. Then 
he forswear arms, and gave up 
arms, and he preached the unity 
of mankind and brotherhood uh... 
in a  in a certain kind of Chris
tian spirit and they killed King. 
(TR) The government spied on 
Martin Luther King and J. Edgar 
Hoover set King up for his death. 
J. Edgar k J. Edgar Hoover de
clared that Dr. Martin Luther King 
was the most dangerous Negro 
in America, and the FBI, of the 
United States government counter-intelligence program stated 
that it was their objective to stop 
the rise of the Black Messiah. Im 
not jut talkin; about Hoover, Im 
talkin about the governments 
stated objective was to stop the 
rise of a Black Messiah. (TR) 
Now who would keep a people in 
bondage for 400 years and then 
try to stop a Messiah from com
ing to them? Who would miseducate a people  do you know, 
talkin about well, well, he didnt 
score as well on the test? Sorry, 
he couldnt get in? You didnt do 
so well here on your SATs  see, 
whites score higher than blacks. 
Did you know for hundreds of 
years we werent even allowed to 
read? (TR)

Did you know that slaves were 
not even allowed to read? Did you 
know discrimination in public 
schools, public colleges, private 
schools, private colleges  most 
of these schools we couldnt even 
get into. They try to act like they 
doin you a favor by letting you 
onto campus when for hundreds 
of years, blacks were banned. 
Blacks were banned from 
becomin lawyers. Blacks were 
banned from becoming doctors. 
Blacks were banned from read
ing. Blacks were banned from 
reading the Bible. Hell, you just 
got the right to vote in 65, and in 
2001 it was thrown into question. 
Huh?
1:33:00
But its a great day. And tonight, 
I say that this is a great night for 
the city of Pittsburgh, and this 
is a great night on the campus 
of Carnegie Mellon University. 
They tried all they could to stop 
us. They tried to hit the lights. 
[...] I say no harm should come 
to the students who put on this 
program, no harm. I say what? 
Say what? (No harm!) Say what? 
(No harm!) Dont they have a 
right to present another point of 
view? Dont the students have a 
right to prevent a diverse point of 
view? All of this multiculturalism. 
Lets all get along and respect each 
other  what they really mean is, 
dont deal with white racism. Just 
accept it and... eat a little collard 
greens, play a little rap music, 
eat a little chop suey  this is 
what they eat. Try to make you 
minimize your culture. Under the 
guise of multiculturalism. Were 
not going for it today.

Center for providing the au

I didnt come to pin the tail 
on the donkey; I came to pin

The state of Israel was taken 
by illegal means; you cannot 
come to me and justify it

And they go around and they 
take quotes from my speeches

You are the origins of ethics. 
You are the origin of religion

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 21, 2005The state of the Western ConferenceMens indoor track prepares for UAAs
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
Even with the reigning NBA 
champions in the East, the 
Western Conference remains 
the tougher of the two. Teams 
that could easily be a number 
four or five seed in the East are 
battling for their playoff lives 
in the west. With Shaq gone, 
Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, 
and Kobe Bryant are battling 
for top dog status, but its the 
little guys like Ray Allen and 
Steve Nash who are getting the 
job done.
Southwest Division
This division is loaded 
with talent, as four of the 
conferences top seven 
teams play in the south
west. The three Texas teams 
(San Antonio, Dallas, and 
Houston) will all be tough 
playoff matchups, and the 
Memphis Grizzlies are showing 
how great depth wins games.
San Antonio Spurs Last 
year, without a clear second 
option, Tim Duncan was forced 
to carry this team on his back at 
times, eventually falling to the 
Lakers in the conference semi
finals. This year, with Tony 
Parker and Manu Ginobili both 
deserving of all-star bids, 
Duncan couldnt be happier  
not that hed smile or anything. 
Tim doesnt do emotion. There 
are too many solid players on 
this team not to consider them 
title favorites.
Dallas Mavericks They let 
a MVP candidate (Steve Nash) 
walk, and they get stron
ger? Oddly enough, without 
Nash they look like a more 
fundamentally sound team, 
especially with center Erick 
Dampier finally starting to play 
like hes not drunk every night. 
The emergence of second year 
man Josh Howard has made 
this team extremely deep at the 
guard/forward position, but 
theyre too thin up front.
Houston Rockets It took a 
while for Tracy McGrady and 
Yao Ming to get used to each 
other, but things finally seem 
to be working out. T-Macs 
presence has allowed Yao 
to get more open looks, and 
as a result hes got the best 
field-goal percentage of his 
career (54.5 percent). Even 
veteran Bob Sura has filled in 
well at point guard, posting 
solid numbers and filling up 
stat lines.
Memphis Grizzlies This 
ten-man rotation is some
how still working, putting 
the Grizz in the middle of the 
playoffs for a second year. Pau 
Gasol is having his best sea
son and the combination of 
Lorenzen Wright and Stromile 
Swift give Memphis a tough 
interior defense. New coach 
Jerry Fratellos tough style is 
helping turn the team around.
New Orleans Hornets 
They looked like they could
have contended in their first 
season in the west. Then Jamal 
Mashburn was lost for the 
season. Then Baron Daviss 
back started acting up. And 
then, finally, Jamal Magliore 
shattered a finger. Its tough to 
win when you lose your three 
all-stars and have to start Dan 
Dickau, Chris Andersen, and 
Lee Nailon in their place.
Northwest Division
The teams that were 
supposed to be good are 
losing, and the one team that 
no one picked to win is at 
the top. Seattle has used an 
energy-filled game to run past 
opponents this year, while 
everyones pick  the 
Timberwolves  cant seem to 
work together as a team.
Seattle Supersonics 
Luke Ridnour is teaching the 
world that hobbits can play 
basketball. Between his passing 
ability, Ray Allens improved 
performance in the final year of 
his contract, and the fact that 
Rashard Lewis seems like he 
finally gets it this season, 
these guys have been smoking 
opponents up and down the 
court. However, Danny Fortson 
has never been a key player for 
a winning team  a testament 
to his selfishness.
Minnesota Timberwolves 
Remember that Adidas 
commercial that had Kevin 
Garnett walking around 
with about 30 people on his 
back? That must be what this 
season feels like to him, as Sam 
Cassell, Troy Hudson, Latrell 
Spreewell and Wally Szczerbiak 
have all looked mediocre this 
season. On a positive note, the 
team gambled on giving trou
bled youngster Eddie Griffin a 
contract, and now hes a 
pick for the Sixth Man award.
Denver Nuggets Werent 
these guys supposed to be 
good? The chemistry just isnt 
working here since the addition 
of bad guy Kenyon Martin. Toss 
in the fact that their only perim
eter shooter, Voshon Lenard, 
was lost to injury in the first 
week of the season, and disas
ter has struck. An early playoff 
favorite, theyre now 3.5 games 
out of a playoff spot.
Portland Trailblazers 
This might be the first team 
in NBA history to have 
11 of their 12 players on the 
trading block. Anyone could 
go at any moment, with rookie 
Sebastian Telfair being the only 
exception. Its going to be a 
while before they can contend 
again.
Utah Jazz The frontcourt 
tandem of Carlos Boozer and 
Andrei Kirilenko has been great 
when both men were healthy, 
but thats about all the Jazz 
have got going for them this 
year. Point guard Carlos Arroyo 
was supposed to be the future 
of the team, but had a falling 
out with coach Jerry Sloan and 
was shipped to Detroit. Without 
stability due to trades and
injuries, the team just hasnt 
been able to play well together.
Pacific Division
The Suns are running away 
with the division, thanks to 
an unstoppable offense thats 
averaging 110 points per game. 
Behind them, Sacramento has 
looked good, and the Lakers 
look like theyll still make it 
into the playoffs behind Kobe 
Bryant. At the bottom, the 
Clippers and Warriors prepare 
for another year of the lottery.
Phoenix Suns Steve Nash 
has been getting a lot of MVP 
talk for a reason. His arrival has 
sparked the Suns to the leagues 
highest scoring average in over 
a decade. Amare Stoudamire 
is playing like a monster 
(26.2 points per game) and 
Shawn Marion is playing at his 
normalhigh level (19 points, 
11 rebounds per game) to push 
this team to the top.
Sacramento Kings Brad 
Millers development into a 
young Vlade Divac and Mike 
Bibbys gritty play has put this 
team in playoff contention for 
the fifth straight year. However, 
Chris Webber will have to get 
rid of his big game demons 
for them to have a shot past 
the first round of the playoffs. 
Peja Stojakovic is having a bad 
season  his numbers are 
down across the board  but 
the addition of Cuttino Mobley 
has added a new dimension on 
offense.
Los Angeles Lakers Kobe 
is showing that he can lead a 
team to the playoffs without 
Shaq, even if it is in the eighth 
and final spot. Lamar Odoms 
rebounding has helped, and 
Chucky Atkins has stepped up 
when needed, but this team 
wont go far without another 
star on the roster.
Los Angeles Clippers 
Theyve done a great job of 
developing talent that comes 
into the organization, most 
notably this year with Bobby 
Simmons. They need to contin
ue this with young point guard 
Shaun Livingston, who has the 
potential to be a franchise 
player down the road. If they 
can lock up their nucleus of 
core players  Elton Brand, 
Simmons, Corey Maggette and 
Marko Jaric  and develop 
their young guys around them, 
they could make the playoffs 
for the first time since the 90s.
Golden State Warriors 
GM Chris Mullen spent $200 
million last summer, and in 
return has sealed up one of the 
worst teams in the West for 
years to come. Center Adonal 
Foyle was given a $50 million 
contract and now averages 
around four points and four 
rebounds per game. Derek 
Fisher got a similar contract 
and is shooting under 40 per
cent for the year. On the plus 
side, the two other guys with 
big contracts, Troy Murphy and 
Jason Richardson, have carried 
this team to their 15 wins.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
track team took fewer members 
to the Kent State meet due to the 
high level of competition present 
at this meet such as Akron and 
Kent State, both Division I schools. 
The competition was better than 
any meet weve been to yet, said 
Junior Ethan Coffey. It was a good 
tune up for UAAs because the 
competition there will be very 
good. Just about everybody who 
went got at least an indoor PR 
(personal record). I got a PR in the 
mile. I was happy with the race 
because I was finally aggressive 
and I dont have much speed yet 
since Im mostly training for the 3k 
right now.
Carnegie Mellon ran a strong 
meet and had several athletes

21 February 2005THE TARTANA14
Women fall to 10th ranked Bears
by Kevin LaBuz
Staffwriter
On Friday evening the Tartans 
womens basketball team (4-18) 
found themselves in a very famil
iar situation: struggling against a 
very solid opponent. The Tartans 
traveled to St. Louis to play the 
Bears of Washington University 
(19-4). For the third time in 
two weeks the Tartans took 
on a nationally ranked oppo
nent  the Bears were recently 
ranked tenth in the nation in 
womens Division III basketball 
by d3hoops.com.
The Tartans scored the 
first points of the game 
with a layup from senior 
forward Lisa Seacat. However, 
the Tartans lead would be short
lived. Less than one minute later, 
Washington University senior 
guard Leslie Berger drained a 
three point basket to give the 
Bears the advantage. For the next 
several minutes the lead would 
bounce back and forth between 
the Tartans and the Bears.
Seven minutes into the game, 
a successful jump shot by Tartans 
senior guard Carissa Sain tied 
the score at 14. However, the 
Bears were in solid control for 
the remainder of the first half. 
Two successful free throws by 
Bears sophomore guard Sara 
Schnell broke the tie and began 
an impressive 21-0 scoring run. 
Tartans junior forward Melissa 
DeAngelo made a layup with 
three minutes remaining in the 
first half, to stop the Bears surge 
10 minutes after it had started. 
The Tartans would score only 
three more points in the remain
der of the period, and at halftime they trailed the Bears by 25 
points, 19-44.
At the break, Seacat led the 
Tartans paltry offense with five 
points. DeAngelo and senior 
forward Mulligan Burns both 
contributed four points. In 
addition, junior center Rebecca
File Photo
Guard Candice Gesecki, shown here against Brandeis, had seven points.
Shore grabbed four rebounds 
for the Tartans. On the other 
end of the court, senior guard 
Kelly Manning led the Bears 
with 16 points, including two 
three-point shots. Senior center 
Hallie Hutchens was a force on 
the glass, leading the Bears with 
seven rebounds.
Sain opened up the sec
ond half for the Tartans with a 
successful layup. In contrast to 
their play in the first half, the 
Tartans played well in the sec
ond half. However the 25-point 
deficit with which they began 
the second half was far too large 
for them to overcome. Despite 
their solid play, the Tartans 
would ultimately fall to the Bears 
75-47.
The Tartans offense, which 
has been anemic throughout the 
season, continued to struggle. 
They managed to convert only 
one of their eight three-point 
attempts. Surprisingly, this field 
goal was made by first-year 
guard Candice Gesecki, and not 
Sain, who usually provides the 
bulk of the Tartans three-point 
game.
The Bears strong defense 
worsened the Tartans offen
sive struggles. The Bears were 
able to force 23 turnovers 
and were very effective in 
capitalizing off of these 
miscues. For the game, they
scored 23 points off of Tartan 
turnovers. Additionally, the 
Bears defense had 16 steals and 
blocked eight shots.
While the Tartan defense 
is usually the teams strength, 
they had trouble containing 
the Bears offense, especially 
their three-point game, where 
the Bears shot nearly 50 per
cent. However, The Tartans were 
still able to force 15 turnovers, 
including nine steals. Shore 
led the defense with four steals 
and five defensive rebounds, 
and first-year forward Christina 
Maksymiuk contributed with the 
Tartans sole block.
Kelly was the Bears scoring 
leader, with a total of 20 points, 
and in addition to contributing 
12 points, Hutchens grabbed 
12 rebounds. The Tartans 
offense was led by Shore and 
Gesecki, who each had seven 
points. Gesecki and Sain led the 
Tartans in rebounds with four 
apiece.
The Tartans will finish their 
season with a string of away 
games. Luckily for them, their 
remaining schedule is free of 
ranked opponents. The Tartans 
will travel to Cleveland to play 
Case Western this Wednesday 
and will conclude their sea
son with a game against the 
University of Rochester on 
Saturday.
Mens basketball within reach of NCAAs
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team took another 
huge step towards an NCAA 
tournament berth with a 
75-73 victory at the University 
of Chicago Sunday afternoon. 
Nate Maurer scored the final 
seven points of the game for the 
Tartans, including the winning 
layup with 1:15 left in the game. 
The team relied on tough defense 
to fend off the Violets last ditch 
efforts to secure the victory.
This win, coupled with a 
University of Rochester loss 
Sunday provides an exciting 
scenario for the mens team. 
Rochester is now 11-2 in the 
conference, while Carnegie 
Mellon stands at 9-3. Should 
the Tartans beat Case Western 
Wednesday, that would put them 
in position to win the UAA with 
a victory in their final game at 
Rochester next weekend. Simply 
put, if the men win their next two 
games, theyll be competing for a 
national title.
The game at Chicago was 
evenly matched throughout the
first half, with Carnegie Mellon 
leading for the majority but never 
by more than five points. Strong 
shooting kept the team afloat, as 
the Tartans shot over 51 percent 
from the field despite hitting only 
one of six three pointers. Reserve 
junior forward Greg Gonzalez 
provided a spark off the bench 
for the team with six points, six 
rebounds, and a block in just 
10 minutes of action.
The Tartans shot worse in the 
second half, but supplemented 
that with strong rebounding. The 
team had many chances and used 
the opportunity to pull away to 
an 11-point lead with 8:16 left in 
the game after a Maurer jumper. 
However, the Violets countered 
with an 11-2 run to knot the 
score at 68-68 with only four min
utes to play. The game remained 
deadlocked until Maurer took 
over, hitting a jumper to break 
the tie. When Chicago guard 
Jesse Meyer hit a three pointer 
to give his team the lead, Maurer 
answered with a three of his own. 
Finally, with the score tied at 
73-73 with 1:30 to play, Maurer 
ended the scoring with a layup 
to give the Tartans the lead for 
good. The Violets held the ball for
the last shot after a missed layup, 
but their final shot fell short, 
giving Carnegie Mellon the victory.
Maurer led the team with 
25 points and contributed eight 
rebounds, a block, and two 
steals. Gonzalez had 12 boards, 
two blocks, and 10 points in only
22 minutes. Senior guard Elliot 
Goren chipped in nine points and 
six assists.
Maurer is looking forward to 
the upcoming challenges at Case 
Western and Rochester. Im so 
excited. I hope we take care of 
business at Case to bring up this 
deciding game. Even more, I 
hope that the fans here get into it, 
realize how good teams on 
this campus can be, get out to 
Rochester to cheer us on. At 
the beginning of the season, 
we expected to be in the NCAA 
Tournament. Now weve got the 
chance to make it happen.
Due to a rescheduled game, the 
Tartans travel to Cleveland for a 
Wednesday night game against 
Case Western Reserve University 
before the penultimate game of 
the season Friday. Their seasons 
rest in the balance of these two 
games, so for them, the playoffs 
have already started.

Womens track performs well in UAA tuneup meets
by Tom Matta
Junior Staffwriter
The womens track team was in 
action at two separate meets this 
weekend, with a few women trav
eling to Kent State for the Kent 
State Tuneup and the majority of 
the team traveling to Marietta, 
Ohio, for the Marietta College 
Open. At Kent State, junior 
distance runner Jocelyn Sikora 
had the most notable perfor
mance, finishing fifth in the mile 
with a time of 5:07. This feat 
is made even more impressive
given the level of competition 
she faced - three of the top four 
competitors in the event ran for 
Division I teams. Also notable was 
Tartan alum Katie Aernis win in 
the 5000 meter run.
At the Marietta College Open, 
the women were able to secure 
a second place overall finish in 
the field of eight. The Tartans 
scored 115.33 points, putting 
them second in a field of 10 
(behind Mount Union College: 
178.50). The team showed a lot 
of depth, scoring points across 
sprinting, distance, and throwing 
events. Olivia Tsai took second in
the 55-meter dash, followed by 
second and third place finishes 
by Shauna Ormon and Kelly 
Mingle in the 300 meter event. 
In the mile run, Jamie Davidson 
and K.J. Helmstetter placed 
second and third, while the 
Tartans placed second through 
fourth in a 3000-meter event that 
had only six competitors.
The womens throwing team 
swept all three places in the 20 
lbs weight throw. Katie Marcoux 
took first place with a mark of 
44-8. Karo line Evans and Becky 
Metier made up second and third, 
with throws of over 43-5.25 and
41-5.75 respectively. Fourth 
place was a distant 32 feet.
The Tartan women look 
forward to the upcoming 
UAA indoor track and field 
championship. Hosted by NYU, 
the meet will be held at the 
Armory in New York City. The 
Armory boasts an Olympic-class 
200-meter MONDO banked track, 
which is known for fast times. The 
team will be leaving Wednesday 
night for Hershey, Pa., where 
they will rest at a hotel before 
completing the trip to New York 
City the next morning. Events will 
span both Friday and Saturday.Mens basketball notches rare win at Washington
by Andrew Clearfield
Staffwriter
Based on Carnegie Mellons 
historic performance this season
- a near upset of Pittsburgh in an 
exhibition game, a school-record 
10 straight victories, and the 
programs first back-to-back 
winning seasons in nearly a decade
- it should come as no surprise 
that Fridays trek to Washington 
University, where CMU had never 
before won, yielded another 
history-making win.
Wholly unintimidated by the 
Bears previous dominance in 
their last matchup, the Tartans 
rolled to a 99-93 victory. Junior 
guard Clayton Barlow-Wilcox 
led CMU with 26 points, while 
senior Michael Divens and junior 
Nate Maurer chipped in 20 and
15 respectively. Scott Stone led 
Washington with 19 points, 
including three three-pointers.
The Tartans jumped out to
a 9-4 lead early on, but were 
unable to pull away until BarlowWilcox ran off six unanswered 
points near the middle of the 
half. Washington continued to 
plod away with its slow half-court 
offense, and eventually trimmed 
the lead to just three points on 
a Michael Faherty three-pointer 
early in the second-half. Still, a 
quick 10-0 run, sparked by seven 
consecutive made free throws, 
put the game out of reach and 
sent the Tartans to their second 
straight victory.
The win moves CMU into 
sole possession of second place 
in the UAA conference behind 
Rochester. They are 16-5 
overall and seem to be in excellent 
position to make the NCAA 
tournament. Head coach Tony 
Wingen, though, has cautioned 
the team that they may need 
to win out in order to earn a 
selection.
According to Barlow-Wilcox, 
Coach tells us every game is a
championship game right now. 
We look at each one as the 
biggest game of the season, 
because if we lose tomorrow 
that might be it. So, as a team 
we definitely understand the 
importance of each game from 
here out.
The victory was particularly 
satisfying from CMUs end, 
because they were forced to play 
a tempo and style of game that 
was ill-suited to their standard 
high-pressure attack. The Bears 
methodically moved the ball on 
offense and then quickly retreat
ed on defense to stop the fast 
break. This slow-down approach 
halted the usually potent Tartan 
runners, who combined for 
zero fast break points and only
16 scores from turnovers. CMUs 
defensive pressure did manage 
to force 14 turnovers, but this 
advantage was erased by the 
14 giveaways they made them
selves that in turn led to
23 Washington points.
The Tartans one clear advan
tage was in their marksmanship. 
They shot a remarkable 86 per
cent from the free-throw line and 
were lights-out from behind the 
arc in the second half, making 
three of six attempts. Washington, 
meanwhile, despite significant 
advantages on the glass and in 
scoring in the paint, could not find 
the basket. They shot less than 
45 percent for the game and found 
themselves battling the shot 
clock much of the night, unable 
to maneuver through CMUs 
aggressive perimeter defense.
The historical significance 
of the win was not lost on the 
Tartans. Barlow-Wilcox called the 
game one of the biggest wins of 
the career, adding, It was a huge 
win, to go in there and beat em 
at Wash. U. for the first time ever; 
its the most exciting win of the 
year I definitely think.
The mens basketball team 
improved to 8-3 in the UAA and 
16-5 overall with the win.

Elkland synthesizes success
Pop band delivers light-hearted lyrics
Theres a small town somewhere in the United States 
that no one has heard of. Nothing happens in this small 
town called Elkland, and no one is from Elkland. Even 
the newly signed band Elkland isnt from Elkland, but 
at least the lonely city can be proud of the fact that it 
is the namesake of Columbia Records latest pop four
some.
Elkland is from Horseheads, an entirely different small 
town located in upstate New York. Jon and Jesse Pierce
 vocals and drums, respectively  grew up in a 
household that confined their music-listening experi
ence to religious music. Joel Tarpin, on keyboards and 
synthesizers, was the Pierces best childhood friend, 
and together the three started a band called Goat 
Explosion. When 2002 rolled around, however, Goat 
Explosion felt they needed a new vibe. They turned to 
guitarist Adam Kessler, and changed the name of the 
band to Elkland.
Each band member grew up messing around with 
old, original synthesizers and listening to what we 
now classify as typical 80s musical fare. Their list of 
influences include Joy Division, who started using 
synthesizers in the late 70s and through the early 80s, 
and The Smiths, who were among the first of bands 
to break away from the over-synthesized music world 
and turn to quick, catchy, guitar-driven pop. While one 
could hardly doubt that these bands are, in fact, core 
influences for Elkland, its hard to avoid the thought 
that Elkland probably sounds a lot like every band 
between Joy Division and The Smiths that had at least 
one hit single.
Elkland has always created music that was remi
niscent of the 80s synth sound, but whether its 
reminiscent or identical is up for debate. Most current 
electronic new wave bands are obviously emulating
the typical sounds of that era, but Elkland takes it 
another step further. While not completely unheard 
of, Elkland is more unique in that the sound quality is 
also similar to that of the original synth-heavy music 
era. The band uses old synthesizers and electric drums 
theyve collected through the years to make the sound 
more authentic, and definitely succeeds in that aspect. 
Listening to Elkland makes you feel as if you just dis
covered a band straight out of the 80s that no one 
previously knew existed.
So make no mistake, in terms of the music and melo
dies, you did hear near-clones of Elkland 20 years ago, 
and Elkland blends in with other synth-pop bands 
during this current attempt at a new-new wave genre. 
However, there are two elements bending this band 
away from completely falling into the black hole of 
musical anonymity.
While this new wave genre focuses on the sounds 
and melodies in a song, the lyrics generally feel less 
important; however, Elkland strives to be at the top of 
the lyrics game, too. Their mission, to take the lyrics 
typical of pop and blend them with the music typical 
of new wave, works. Its clear that their goal to be in 
pop-lyrics heaven has been achieved. Each of Elklands 
songs contains an obvious hook, and that hook is 
milked for all its worth. Every songs lyrical focus is 
the chorus, and a listener will find it hard to home in 
on any other aspect of the song. They maintain their 
consistency throughout the album by having a build
ing verse that leads right into a strong and exciting 
chorus. The catchy hooks and singable choruses make 
listening to this band a good choice for light-pop music 
lovers everywhere.

Robert Breer talks at Carnegie Art Museum
Making the jump from painter to filmmaker
Although changing careers has become mainstream in many professions, it is still not 
common in the realm of art. Robert Breer, who spoke at the Carnegie Mellon Museum 
of Art this Saturday, defied convention by switching from painter to filmmaker. His 
career as a painter is reflected in his films, and his whimsical nature shows through, as 
well. Breers geometric penmanship mirrors that of his paintings, creating, as he said, 
a bit of formality in his work. The fun, cartoony side of his films stems directly from his 
self-proclaimed lighthearted nature.
Fittingly, he began his talk on Saturday by stating that he hoped this lecture would be 
informal and down-to-earth. Breer explained how he had moved from oil painting to 
film because he wanted to extend the breadth of his audience. He had looked sadly on as 
his paintings were sold and taken away from him, to be enjoyed by only one person in a 
living room. The idea of film became enticing as he watched his works projected before 
feature films in theaters that reached hundreds, if not thousands of people. Indeed, it 
was the sheer magnitude of the audience that attracted him to film. After a great deal of 
self-questioning, Breer admitted that he had worked so long and hard on films that he 
could not bring himself back to oil paintings: His heart was no longer in the work.
The lecture consisted of Breer reminiscing over his past adventures as he created his 
films. He focused on the four films that were presented during his lecture: Recreation, A 
Man and his Dog out for Air, Fuji, and Swiss Army Knife with Rats and Pigeons. He excit
edly told the crowd of his joy when the first of these films, Recreation, was shown to an 
audience. He worked up the audience in the lecture hall for nearly 10 minutes before 
the celebrated film was run. The audience then witnessed about two minutes of ran
dom pictures flicked across the screen at, as he reminded them, a speed of 24 frames a 
second. Throughout the short film, there were times of slow movement with sculptures 
filmed in stop motion, but for the most part, simple objects flashed across the screen. 
The film ended with the word Fini, and everyone applauded. Although he had spent 
some time explaining the lengths to which he had gone to make the film flow from one 
frame to the next, the flow in this series of pictures was difficult to find.
The next short film, A Man and his Dog out for Air, received much less introduction. The 
film depicted two minutes of lines on a screen taking different vaguely recognizable 
shapes. Audience members applauded again when the word end floated across the 
screen. This film definitely had a flow from one frame to the next, but the connection 
between the title and the plot would have been more understandable if it had been 
shown more than once.
Breer gave a more extended introduction for his next film, Fuji. He explained his in
teractions with various other artists and patrons in his travels, notably to Japan, and 
lightheartedly forgot his train of thought throughout the talk. This film consisted of a 
person sitting on a train and gazing at Mount Fuji as the vehicle rumbled by. The mixed 
scenes and implied emotions reflected the unstable nature of the train. This film was 
significantly longer than the others, extending for nearly five minutes. Again, it was 
received with a round of applause from the audience. The beginning of this film, as 
stated, seemed to capture the seeming chaos of the train next to the sturdy and unmoving mountain. The latter half of the film, though, again became a series of incoherent 
pictures, flashing by quickly with a disjointed structure to them.
An hour having passed, Breer then quickly showed the fourth and final film, Swiss Army 
Knife with Rats and Pigeons. This was the only one for in which he explained his motiva
tion for creating the film in any way, although it was incredibly brief. He informed the 
audience that the title Swiss Army Knife was too boring, so he decided to add rats and 
pigeons. His inspiration for including pigeons came from his neighbors house, the rats

from his own. Unfortunately, no other details concerning motivations were offered. The 
last film was of the same theme as the others, passing images in a quick and choppy 
manner and portraying, predictably, rats, pigeons, and a Swiss army knife. He also in
cluded in this film an airplane and his friend waving, who, he explained, had died in an 
airplane accident. This film was again met by applause. Whether or not the audience 
actually understood what happened, or if they only clapped because it was the expected 
thing to do, was not clear. The artist never explained his vision. Certainly, it was hard 
to reconcile the sequence of images with the implied plot in every case. Even after the 
lecture concluded, it was unclear where the vision ended and the chaos began in Breers 
work.

Moxie Da DA Museum displays eclectic art
Local artists create art inspired by yoga and the colors blue and orange
Nestled among the Italian conversations of Pittsburghs 
Little Italy in Bloomfield, Moxie DaDA is a revolving door 
and exhibition place of local artists. From the outside win
dow looking in, one can see an ocean of orange paintings 
on the right wall and a river of blue paintings on the left. 
Open the gallerys doors, and owner Christine Whispell 
is talking on the phone across the room. Whispell, who 
until recently worked at the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review as 
a graphic designer, now runs her own art studio.
The role of art advocate is one Whispell has always 
wanted to take on. She talks of her artists and proudly 
has a collection of paintings from various Pittsburgh 
painters in the back of her studio, which doubles as an 
office and showroom. This months theme features yoga, 
one of Whispells many interests, and the colors blue and 
orange. The show, titled Connect, is Moxie DaDAs mix
ture of yoga, meditation, and relaxation to create a ful
filling experience.
Many people dont have alone time for themselves, 
Whispell says. Yoga provides that.
Blue is supposed to represent calmness and peace, while 
orange represents energy. On the right wall, orange 
paintings appear like sheets of orange construction pa
per; upon closer inspection they reveal much character 
and life. The paintings are eclectic  some have num
bers, others newspaper clippings, and still others swirls
 and are diverse in their shades of blue and orange. The
Museum owner Christine Whispell and coordinator Grant Bobitski pose in front of a yoga-inspired piece.
oldest works in the exhibit are ones by Bonnie Pittsburgh 
from the early 1970s. The most puzzling is a mathemati
cal work that evokes memories of the movie Pi.
The past two Saturdays, South Sides Breathe Yoga Studio 
has taught free yoga classes at Moxie DaDA. One more 
yoga class, from 1 to 2 pm, is scheduled for this Saturday. 
Whispells goal is to mix her art studio with other Pitts
burgh organizations. During the last show, a collabora
tion with Street Art, a non-profit group that collects art by 
local homeless artists and then gives all the profits back 
to them, raised over $300.
Next month Moxie DaDA will have a floral show, at 
which a variety of art and floral arrangements will be for 
sale. Somewhere in the middle of Whispells descriptions, 
gallery coordinator Grant Bobitski walks in. He turns on 
the gallerys stereo system to NPR and explains how he 
builds doors and temporary walls to give the art space 
its intended look. Presentation is a huge part of being 
exhibit coordinator, he says. If a person has an idea of 
what they want to do for a show, this space is extremely 
accommodating.
As for Pittsburgh artists, Moxie DaDA is interested in hav
ing venturing new artists walk though its doors. Because 
they are in their beginning stages, Whispell and Bobitski 
say they want to avoid being like formal galleries which 
aim for goals that are not exclusively artistic. Lets be 
honest; lets stop beating around the bush  once you 
reach a certain level, its about selling artwork. But a lot 
of kids are not interested in selling, says Bobitski.
Its about expression  its about doing something you 
cant do through music, you cant do through language. 
Once you get to [the formal level its] more about the 
business of art. Here, we are about displaying artwork, 
says Bobitski. We want to sell the artwork; we want to 
make the artist money and in turn make us a couple of 
dollars, but were just trying to provide an informal space 
that folks can come in and show [their work]. We are 
hoping to pay the bills with other projects  not neces
sarily put the pressure on the artwork to make the money. 
I think the other art galleries put the pressure on their 
artwork and when you do that you really have to be selec
tive; you really put some handcuffs on you. Adds Whis
pell: We are interested in a lot of things. We want people 
to say Wow! I havent seen that in a while. 
Moxie DaDA has other ideas for the near future. They 
have a website in the works and will also offer a service of 
portfolio advising for artists.

Orange and blue drapes dangle in the museum windows of 
Moxie DaDA.
Whispell and Bobitski, along with Matt Indovina, a cre
ative scout, work hard so that Moxie DaDA earns a strong 
reputation. Like adding layers on a canvas, the future is 
limitless in possibilities.

Scotch n Soda Double Shot dramas
WASP and Black Idiot Box blend creative comedy with commentary on society
The members of Scotch n Soda produced and performed 
a double feature this past weekend: two shows sprinkled 
with humor but mostly with serious intentions. The first 
production, WASP, was written by Steve Martin and 
directed by Connor OMalley and Joe McDermott, two 
juniors in mechanical and chemical engineering, respec
tively. The second drama, titled Black Idiot Box, was writ
ten by an alumnus of the university, Darren Canady, and 
was directed by Ashley Birt. Side by side, the plays told 
the story of a white family and an African-American fam
ily and were blended by messages beneath the surface 
about the ironies of social norms. While Martins writing 
in WASP wove subtle hints about the desires and fears of 
the white American upper-middle class, Black Idiot Boxs 
tones were much more blatant. Canadys writing created 
a drama that was never shy at the suggestion of what 
common portrayals of African-Americans have done to 
harm the reality of their situation though time.
WASP
WASP was peppered liberally with introspection from the 
characters, all of whom revealed their anxieties. The play 
opened on a family of four  the stereotypical mom, 
dad, brother, sister affair, everyone was attired in the 
garb of the 50s. The opening dinner scene was humor
ous: the father (first-year CS major Dan Tasse), insisted 
to his son that the world is just under 5000 years old. 
Tasse delivered his humorous lines with a pompous flair 
which was accented by a liberal use of finger-wagging. 
Throughout the meal, Tasses comments on the age of 
the world and the distance of heaven from earth poked 
fun at those who take a literal translation of the Bible.
The two female members of the family seemed exiled 
from the affections of the father. Sis, played by junior 
English major Kaitlin Genovese, couldnt even get her 
father to remember her name. Mom (first-year H&SS stu
dent Theresa Campobasso), however, could only garner 
her husbands affection from behind a copy of The Wall 
Street Journal. During a hilarious scene, Mom revealed 
that she had been having symptoms similar to an anxi
ety attack, and that she has been hearing voices  all 
of which was delivered in her consistently high-pitched 
June Cleaver voice. When Mom was done explaining 
her troubles to her husband, he told her how very much 
he loved her and how dedicated he was to the marriage
 all while behind his newspaper. The two shared a pas
sionate kiss, with the newspaper between them, and 
then rushed off to bed.
The play got truly bizarre from then on. Campobasso 
was visited by her voices, which was just really one 
voice  that of Sarah Barbour, a first-year H&SS student.
Campobassos bewildered and wide-eyed faces added 
perfectly to her characters innocent naivete.
Meanwhile, the entire family was relatively deranged. 
The son, played by Rob Cavagnaro, a first-year CIT stu
dent, was also visited. In this case, though, the visit 
was by what looked like an alien life form: the Premier. 
Cavagnaros character carried off a naivete similar to 
that of his mother, with wide eyes and a lot of By golly! 
lines. But Cavagnaro seemed to have fewer lines and his 
role was somewhat undermined by the more stage-com
manding presences of those around him.
The Premier, in contrast, was performed hilariously by 
senior English major Adam Atkinson, who also played 
the choirmaster and the butler, Rodger. Atkinson stole 
the stage with his robotic hand motions and vocal style. 
It didnt seem a shame that all the laughter surrounding 
The Premiers quirky character disguised the strange 
dialogue.
In her role as the sister, Genovese seemed to exemplify 
the teenage girl desperate for a boys affection. But her 
true notions were revealed at choir practice: In mid
song, she broke scene to suddenly describe her ambi
tions. Her description went on about how she longed to 
be a star, with flashbulbs breaking all around her and 
a giant beaded dress so heavy she could hardly stand 
up straight  but she did. Genovese put an admirable 
amount of passion into her lines; her voice really did 
echo that of an adolescent dreaming of fame. However, 
as with all things in the play, the dialogue went bizarre: 
Genovese claimed to want to give birth to, and later 
marry, the baby Jesus. While dialogue like this was 
rather complex, Genovese gave it a lot of power with her 
voice and gestures. But as her resolve began to break, 
Genovese carefully cracked her voice, and her gestures 
became timid to reflect the mood.
The final revelation was that of the father, who revealed 
that his love for his wife was wrapped in the notion of 
being able to provide for her. Tasse gracefully unbut
toned his shirt and untied his tie (which he never took off 
throughout the play) so that the motions were fluid and 
fitting with his monologue. However, his voice seemed a 
bit weak, almost squeaking or cracking where it should 
have been emphatic and strong.
Though nothing was resolved and no real plot developed, 
it certainly gave one a lot to mull over, as was noted in the 
directors note in the program. Each actor placed a lot of 
emotion into their lines, but the play ended abruptly be
fore giving the audience any satisfaction if they had been 
sharing those emotions with the characters.
Black Idiot Box
Whereas WASP opened onto a quiet family dinner, Black 
Idiot Box opened onto a loud, out-of-control dysfunc
tional family. The play began with Paula (senior biology 
major Suhana de Leon) on the phone with her publisher. 
Paula, who works for a magazine, became angered by 
the way her publisher begins twisting her words. Her 
husband Sam (first-year CS major Kwasi Mensah) then 
stormed in and demanded to have the phone  his 
promotion at work was on the line. The scene escalated 
more when their children started fist-fighting, adding 
a fervor of energy to the scene. Felicia (first-year H&SS 
major Shayna Watson) and Derek (junior psychology 
major Effion Brown III) lit up the stage: Their constant 
bickering and excellent ability to deliver lines simultane
ously supported the concept of two siblings who were 
constantly at odds.

---------------------------------------------------

When Derek became seriously injured in the fight with 
his sister, his mother said some magic words that trans
port the family into the sets of different stereotypical 
television shows. After Paula finished proclaiming her 
hatred for the family, the disgruntled family exited the 
stage and re-emerged in the next scene, which set in the 
50s. De Leon, who played the angry and loud mother 
in the first scene extraordinarily well, barked orders to 
her children and pulled a phone off the wall in a heated 
argument with her husband. Black Idiot Box gave her a 
chance to show a lot of character diversity: De Leon gave 
her sugary-sweet smile just enough to get the cheesiness 
of the scenes across while still able to portray the depth 
of her character.
The real social slam of the play was when its scenes 
repeatedly showed the death scene of Derek in each TV 
episode. In the 50s, the children obediently shuffled to 
school and returned home bloodied by men with fire 
hoses and attack dogs. De Leon and Mensah did a fine 
job of playing up their temporary denial of the truth. If 
the audience hadnt already caught that this was about 
the segregation and racism that African-Americans faced 
during the 1950s, that point was hounded during a 2-3 
minute projection onto the wall of the set. The projection 
showed images of televisions shows portraying happygo-lucky whites juxtaposed against images of the Ku Klux 
Klan cross burnings and scenes from the desegregation 
of schools, complete with fire hoses and attack dogs. 
The film sequence certainly got its point across, but its 
writing and acting did that just as well and this addition 
seemed extraneous and over-the-top theatrical.
An almost identical situation as the first was played out 
twice more, but in different settings and with slightly 
different resolutions. An obvious parody of The Cosby 
Show follows next. Mensah played his goofy, Cosby-like 
role to a T, complete with hilarious little dance sequences 
and lots of tough-love delivery when he dealt with the 
kids. This scene had a lot of references to how much 
whites used images such as those from The Cosby Show 
to develop an ideal of what a black family should be. 
It seemed a plotline pulled straight from the comedy 
routines of Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock. To the actors 
credit, though, they didnt outdo the more preachy lines 
or the social commentary, and the lines did seem to blend 
well with the more comedic elements.
The last scene was definitely one of the most humorous. 
De Leon had been transformed into a religious fanatic in 
the ghetto, begging the Lord to help her come up with 
the rent money. Watson and Brown played up to one an
other perfectly in this scene, with shouts and waves that 
really carried the humorous moments of the play. Most
hilarious though, was that after the predictable shooting 
that brings Derek down, Mensah proclaimed, I feel the 
need to give him tribute in song. He was handed a piece 
of bling and began rapping a rendition of Puff Daddys 
Ill Be Missing You. The audience roared, and his antics 
onstage earned a great deal of approval.
Robert Kaminski/Photo Editor
Adam Atkinson played The Premier, along with a few other 
small parts, in WASP.
The play concluded during the chorus of Ill Be Missing 
You when Derek jumped up and begged them to stop 
singing. But Black Idiot Boxs writing lost a lot of impact 
by abruptly ending when de Leon raised her hands in a 
half-shrug and said anticlimatically that the only logical 
way to progress was for them all to be responsible for 
themselves.
Success In Depth
Both WASP and Black Idiot Box managed to stay lightheartedly humorous despite their depth and social com
mentary. While they each approached their commentary 
very differently, the plays did fit well side by side. To be 
fair, a major drawback of the performance was its strange 
venue in Peter/Wright/McKenna. Audience members 
(which could number no more than about 60) were 
packed into the space left over by the large open set, and 
the lights were so bright that every audience member 
could read their neighbors T-shirts. In addition, this 
venue prevented any mystery ocurring when the stage 
crew clattered around between scenes. The lighting 
seemed hard to manage, as well, changing abruptly to 
a little lower or a slightly different color without warn
ing. The particularly long scene changes took a lot away 
from the flow of both pieces, though Black Idiot Box had 
a decided advantage by being able to play music between 
scenes.
The drawbacks of the venue should not take away from 
the competence of the actors, though. Despite dealing 
with difficult subject matter, all were obviously ex
tremely well-practiced and put a lot of life into the small 
stage. The stage itself was nicely done, with no distract
ing elements, but also a relatively believable look to it
 even though the audience was practically on top of 
it, it still appeared quite realistic. In all, the two plays 
complimented each other fairly well and gave some truly 
entertaining moments while simultaneously delivering 
some interesting commentary to ponder.

Guest speakers visit Carnegie Mellon for Sex Week
Owner of Girls Night In discusses the need for lubrication and communication
Sexuality is an issue on which every student at Carnegie 
Mellon University has an opinion. Some view it as an un
necessarily suppressed phenomenon, while others claim 
that it has already taken too large of a role in our soci
ety, particularly in the media. Politicians and ordinary 
citizens argue endlessly about their differing stances on 
abortion, sex education in schools, and gay marriages. 
But regardless of the form they take, the concepts of sex 
and sexuality stir primitive emotions in people. Confront
ing some of these emotions in varying mediums is crucial, 
as everyones relationship with sex is unique.
An aura of mystery still surrounds sex, bringing with it 
misconceptions and a sense of confusion. This confusion 
about our primitive urges and drives has caused humans 
to view sex as a taboo topic. While our society has become 
increasingly liberal and open about sexuality, many ageold taboos still remain. One of the most stubborn taboos 
is one concerning women. Is our role that of a mother, a 
virgin, or a sex object?
Sex Week, organized every other year by the Womens 
Center, aims to shed light on some of these mysteries and 
taboos. Through events such as Sex 101 and aphrodisiac 
food tasting, the Center hopes to present sex in an en
joyable and comfortable way to the entire campus com
munity. We aim to make it fun, first and foremost, said 
Jairan Sadeghi, a senior fine arts and linguistics major 
and an active member of the Womens Center.
We also want to shed some light on some of the taboos 
surrounding sex, especially sexual relations in same-sex 
couples, usage of sex toys, [as well as] talking openly 
about sex and ones sexuality, Sadeghi explained. A 
sex toy workshop was held on Tuesday in the University 
Centers Danforth Lounge, conducted by founder and co
owner of Pittsburgh-based Girls Night In Karen Derzic. 
The event attracted a large number of female students, 
and some male students as well.
Sex toys of every imaginable color, shape, size, and tex
ture covered a small table in the room. Derzic began by 
giving a basic anatomy lesson, and moved on to present 
the audience with a wide array of sex toys available in the 
market. The products ranged from large to small, loud to 
quiet, gentle to powerful, and were designed for every 
conceivable preference, to be used either alone or with 
a partner. The names of the toys were particularly cre
ative, including Red Zinger, Echo, Buddy, Orchid 
G, Little Flirt, and The Witty Worm. Girls Night In 
also carried lubricants, dental dams, and condoms of dif
ferent varieties.
While the audience passed around various brands of lu
bricant and compared their textures, smells, and even
tastes, Derzic took time to explain that the Durex extra 
sensitive lubricated condom is the most durable condom 
on the market. Participants had a chance to touch and 
examine every toy presented during the event, and place 
orders after the workshop if they so wished. Questions 
could be posed to Derzic either in front of the group or 
confidentially afterwards.
After the workshop, members of the Womens Center 
held a raffle in which some of the toys presented were 
given away. Before wrapping up the workshop, Derzic 
left her audience with an important message: Accord
ing to her, the most important aspects of successful sex 
are lubrication and communication. Girls Night In, the 
company that brought the workshop to Carnegie Mellon 
University, is a sexuality resource center and sex toy shop. 
Karen Derzic and Alison Bodenhemier, her current busi
ness partner, got the idea for the company about two 
years ago when both women were attending the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. They had known each other previously 
through volunteer work and school and wanted a safe, 
comfortable place for the women of Pittsburgh to come 
to, explained Derzic.
Through the workshop at Carnegie Mellon, Derzic hoped 
to show college students the different forms that sex can 
take and help young people discover what they each indi
vidually feel comfortable with. Derzic believes sex isnt 
necessarily [just] hooking up with someone at a party.
According to Derzic, a slow change to some societal taboos 
about sexuality is taking place. The belief that women are 
the passive party and men the aggressive party in sex still 
exists, but society is beginning to embrace the possibility 
that women might approach sex more assertively. With 
events such as the sex toy workshop, Derzics Girls Night 
In hopes to bring across a message that shows women in 
charge of their own sexuality, out there pursuing it.
Derzic encouraged those who are hesitant to explore 
their sexual selves to understand [their] own comfortability. She recognizes communication between part
ners to be essential for a successful sexual experience and 
believes this communication is often lacking, especially 
causing young people to feel uneasy and self-conscious 
about matters of sex.
According to Sadeghi, Sex Week put on the table an im
portant point: that sexuality is worth addressing. Its a 
unifying agent, and we feel it needs to be recognized as 
such. There is too much secrecy and shame surrounding 
sex and sexuality, and we want people to recognize that 
in order to better know ourselves and our peers and our 
societies, we must educate ourselves about sex, said Sa
deghi.
With events such as Sex Week that promote an open, 
candid attitude about sexuality, perhaps todays college 
students will step out into the world with a more natural 
attitude about inherent aspects of the human mind that 
are so often avoided or presented in a perverted light in 
the media.
Through Sex Week, the Womens Center set an example 
for young women everywhere: Women should embrace 
and communicate their own sexuality and encourage 
others to do so as well.

Student Union: remembered and revisited
Spunky publication left its mark on CMU community
February 27 will mark the four-year anniversary of the 
last publication of the Student Union. For over 15 years, 
the Student Union served as Carnegie Mellons alternative 
newspaper; now there are few students remaining who 
have ever seen an issue. Had the Student Union contin
ued to publish, it would be nearing its 20th anniversary. 
Although the first issues are older than most current first 
year students, the newspaper remains both relevant and 
remarkable today.
A cursory look through the front pages of the newspaper 
will immediately shock any reader. The physical design 
of each paper is unique and often stunning. Employing 
elaborate artwork and chaotic designs, no two issues of 
the Student Union look similarand frequendy two con
secutive issues bear no resemblance to each other at all. 
Furthermore, the newspaper was willing to take chances 
that may exceed current students expectations of what 
Carnegie Mellon University used to be. One issue in par
ticular displayed the word FUCK in three-inch tall let
ters on the front page, above an article discussing cen
sorship. This willingness to be creative and controversial 
extended far beyond the newspapers design. Each issue 
contains articles, poetry, cartoons, and art that frequent
ly pushed whatever boundaries were available. Topics of 
discussion ranged from the minutiae of student govern
ment to international politics.
Taking a single issue as a sample demonstrates every
thing that made the Student Union unique. On the front 
cover of Vol. 5, No. 10 (published around mid-February 
1990) a line drawing of a man holds the masthead. In
side the paper is an article on Nelson Mandelas release 
from jail, a report on how Chatham College women pro
tested going coed, a chart of Eastern Bloc elections, and 
the first of a two-part series inspired by Michael Moores 
first movie Roger & Me: a long discussion on the relation
ship between capital and labor. Also present is something 
I never thought could have existed: A quiz on being more 
politically correct, which was slightly tongue-in-cheek but 
nonetheless intended to educate people on how to be in
offensive. Finally, that issue was rounded off by a political 
cartoon, a speech given by the Student Body President to 
the Board of Trustees, and an interview with an alumnus.
I was able to get in contact with one of the members of 
the editorial collective responsible for publishing this 
issue. Kevin DeYager (H&SS 90) joined the Student Union 
in 1987, in its second year at CMU. He would later write 
up his experiences in a retrospective issue in 1998, which 
led me to try to get in contact with him.
DeYager, who is now a product manager for a Silicon Val
ley tech company (we can't mention which), still spoke 
very fondly of the Student Union. DeYager commented on
one memorable issue: I remember staying up all night 
when Bush won the election putting that issue together. It 
was done with rubber cement, rulers, Exacto knives, and 
a light table. According to DeYager, the Student Union 
used a single Macintosh computer and a laser printer 
to put out issues in addition to the materials described. 
With this, they managed to cobble together two issues a 
month.
The Student Union was housed in the now-demolished 
Skibo Center with an office next to The Tartans. As De 
-Yager put it, the Student Union's whole office was the size 
of The Tartans editors personal office. In many ways this 
relationship mirrored how the Student Union saw itself: 
the scrappy counterpart to the main newspaper on cam
pus, offering views that wouldnt otherwise get into the 
mainstream. We tried to cover many different issues but 
were always viewed as coming from the left. We did in
vite others and were always open that way, explained 
DeYager.
It is hard to ascertain to what degree the paper was able 
to present opposing viewpoints. It is clear that as the edi
torial collective changed over time, so too did the Student 
Union's political orientation and relationship to Carnegie 
Mellon. There always existed a certain degree of radical
ism to the paper, which it sometimes placed on the front

page. It claimed: The Student Unions general concern 
for resistance is motivated by the belief that for current 
power structures to genuinely consider real solutions 
would mean drawing into question the very existence of 
those same power structures. At other times, the edito
rial collective (which was occasionally referred to as the 
non-editors collective, or the anarchist collective) would 
produce a paper that was extremely similar to The Tartan, 
focusing on Student Senate elections, campus affairs, and 
student opinion.
In many ways the two newspapers complemented each 
other, especially on campus issues. It 
was not uncommon for the Student 
Union to cite an article in The Tartan 
and continue an investigation into 
what was happening. In fact, Stu
dent Senate plans to change the stu
dent government constitution this 
week because student government is 
still required to advertise in both The 
Tartan and the Student Union (which 
raises some issues of compliance over 
the past four years).
Yet there was a certain degree of an
tagonism towards The Tartan that 
appeared regularly throughout the 
Student Union, which once referred 
to The Tartan as the conservative 
administration mouthpiece. Paul 
Jacobs (SIA 01), one of the last edi
tors of the Student Union, put it this 
way: We felt the Student Union was 
necessary at the time because, like 
any concentrated media outlet, there needed to be an 
alternative to the Tartan. One whose members wouldnt 
be afraid to challenge power structures and put forth po
litical commentary that extended beyond CMUs campus 
and also connected our campus to long-standing issues in 
higher education.
One of the continuing threads throughout the Student 
Unions history was an opposition to militarization and 
the Software Engineering Institute. Throughout the 
paper, there are numerous advertisements for protests 
and calls for action against the main source of weaponsrelated research on campus. For a brief time period, anti
militarization protestor Vince Eirine was a member of the 
editorial collective and there are a number of interviews 
with him and others who opposed the Software Engi
neering Institute. Further articles against CIA recruiting 
at job fairs and the presence of the Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps (ROTC) on campus continued this theme.
This antagonism extended beyond criticism of the 
military-industrial-academic complex and was direct
ed at decisions made by the occupants of Warner Hall. 
The Student Union frequently criticized those in power, 
whether it was the University president, student govern
ment, or anyone they felt was not acting in the students 
best interests. Yet while the Student Union was often a 
thorn in the side of those in power, the organization had 
a significantly more complicated relationship to the ad
ministration than that of the simple muckraker.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Murphy had this to say 
about the paper: The Student Union. Yes, I loved them 
all. Dearly. They were like flower children with a bad 
attitude. Actually, they were not as nettlesome as they 
imagined themselves to be. It was good to have what 
was viewed at that time to be something of an alterna
tive voice. I confess, there were some articles that were 
truly over the top. A few things that I thought were re
ally hurtful over the years, honestly, although that always 
surprised me. Being constructive and risking offense is a 
far different thing than being hurtful and intending of
fense, and I think they managed that well, for the most 
part. It makes for a really difficult and important editorial 
job, to be sure. I still have a cartoon they drew of me here 
somewhere. Pretty unflattering. I liked it a lot.
Some of the most interesting issues of the Student Union 
were the ones which were never seen by students. In 
1989, all 1000 copies of an issue about National Com
ing Out Day were stolen before students could see them.
The Student Unions publisher once censored a picture of 
a snow penis constructed by architecture students in 
front of the College of Fine Arts building. Furthermore, 
there are at least two cases in which an issue was released 
in duplicate with small changes between the two for rea
sons that arent clear.
For all of its anarchistic tendencies, the Student Union was 
able to sustain itself as a serious campus institution for 
quite some time. By 1990, the newspaper had a budget of 
$20,000 and was paid for in part by the student activities 
fee. Yet by the late 90s, the newspaper had clearly be
gun to falter. At some point, the layout began 
to look less like a newspaper and more like 
a pamphlet. The regularity of publication de
creased and the design got less creative. By 
the 2000-2001 school year, the Student Union 
only put out one issue, its very last.
By this point, the Student Union had merged 
with Student Activist HeadQuarters, which 
is also defunct now. The issue was a single 
two-sided page with four articles and no art
work. MattToups, a fifth-year senior studying 
computer science and history, attended the 
very last meeting of the Student Union when 
he was a first-year. Sitting down with the ar
chives of the Student Union, Matt looked over 
the old issues: I find it really surprising and 
inspiring that there was such a creative, bold, 
radical and dissenting voice on campus. Com
ing here as a freshman or on a campus tour, 
you never would have known.
While Toups never got a chance to write for 
the Student Union, he was one of the founders of Students 
for Independent Media and helped create the Pittsburgh 
Indymedia website (www.indypgh.org). He also helps 
host Rust Belt Radio on CMUs WRCT. Looking through 
old issues, he remarked: Students should look at this and 
realize that they shouldnt be passive consumers of media, 
whether its national corporate media or The Tartan.

Reeves heats things up in Constantine
Not just a knockoff of The Matrix
John Constantine is not a happy man. Blessed with the 
curse (or the gift, depending on how optimistic youre 
feeling today) of being able to see the demons and 
angels that live among us, Constantine (Keanu Reeves) 
attempted to kill himself as a teen to end his visions. 
Suicide is, of course, a mortal sin in Catholic doctrine 
and consequently poor John was sent straight to hell. 
The miracles of modern medicine brought John back to 
life after two minutes in an ambulance, and he was given 
another lease on life  whether he wanted it or not.
Johns brush with the underworld was enough to scare 
him straight. John spent his life learning the finer points 
of occult teachings and performing difficult exorcisms 
across Los Angeles in hopes of saving enough souls to be 
let into Heaven. Unfortunately, the gates of Heaven arent 
really open to bargaining. Unless John can show God 
that hes not just trying to save his own skin, hes going 
straight back to Hell when he dies  which, it turns out, 
will be much sooner than he expects, for chain-smokinginduced lung cancer, not demons, will do John in.
When an exorcism goes wrong and John pulls a soldier 
demon from a girl, he starts getting suspicious: After all, 
demons are supposed to stay in Hell, right? One night 
outside of a gas station, when another full-fledged demon 
attacks John, he becomes convinced that things are about 
to go downhill.
John isnt the only one who can see beyond the natural 
realm. Isabel, another suicide victim, and her twin sister 
Angela (The Mummy's Rachel Weisz), who has now 
become a detective with the LAPD, both had these visions 
as children. The difference was that Angela denied they

Demon-in-disguise Gavin Rosedale. Yes, it's him.
were true, while Isabel kept seeing more. When Angela 
reviews security tapes and sees her sister whisper 
Constantines name before her death, she asks him for 
help in solving the case. As their investigation progresses, 
more of Hells sinister plot is revealed.
Constantine, which is based on the comic book Hellblazer 
(a DC Comics property), takes Catholic mythology 
and runs with it. The crux of the conflict in the film is 
Mammons rise to power. Mammon, the son of Lucifer, as 
foretold in Hells Bible (which has extra chapters and a 
different story of Revelation and Armageddon), will come 
to Earth seeking to create a reign of, well, Hell on Earth. 
But he needs some divine intervention to help it happen, 
and that comes in the form of the Spear of Destiny.
The Spear is a fabled artifact that was said to have killed 
Jesus by piercing his side while on the cross; like most 
sacred icons, it supposedly has great power. Many legends 
have it falling into Hiders hands at the start of World War II, 
and in fact it is wrapped in a red Nazi flag when it is found 
during the intro to the film.
Its a fair criticism to say that Constantine has a convoluted 
plot. Most tales steeped in obscure Christian references 
tend to become complicated pretty quickly. Constantines 
saving grace, however, is that the narrative never bogs 
down by going into too much detail. While this requires 
a rather hefty suspension of disbelief, it keeps the action 
fast-paced enough that your imagination can fill in the 
gaps and make sense of the story as everything proceeds 
around you. Going along for the ride is the order of the 
day in Constantine and it turns out to be an effective 
storytelling device.
There is no single outstanding element to Constantine. 
The art direction and effects, of course, take center stage 
in many peoples minds, and for due reason. Some scenes 
are positively jaw-droppingmore specifically the scenes 
in Hell. First-time director Francis Lawrences vision of 
Satans realm is dreamlike and at the same time starkly 
believable. Heat shimmers across the screen when the 
view first shifts to the underworld and Constantine starts 
his journey to find Isabels soul. Hell takes the form of a 
post-nuclear-holocaust metropolis, complete with wind
swept dust streaming from every edge of the landscape.
The Hell effects are heartstopping, but the rest of the visual 
effects are top-notch as well. Angels have realistic wings, 
and demons are appropriately slimy and otherworldly. 
However, the supporting characters really steal the 
show, even though they are only featured sparsely. Peter 
Stormare plays a memorable Satan holding a grudge

Reeves gets attacked by demons while trying to escape.
against Constantine, and Tilda Swinton brings an intense, 
unique presentation to the Archangel Gabriel.
As with any Keanu Reeves movie, Constantine isnt going 
to provoke serious intellectual discussion. However, its 
a continuation of the trend of obscure comics properties 
making very enjoyable action flicks  a trend most 
recently exemplified by this past springs Hellboy. If you 
enjoy dark action movies with a very involved universe 
behind the story, Constantine is right up your alley, even 
with the lackluster performances from Reeves and Weisz. 
Great winter movies are hard to find  for a blast of 
hellfire to warm up the cold nights, check out this film.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
nf0
Carlow Brack extended his hand to Wilbur, who hadnt even had a chance to stand up 
yet. Carlows arm and hand were huge. He pulled Wilbur out of the couch and shook 
Wilburs hand in one swift motion, then whisked Wilbur back into his office. It, too, 
was dimly lit. The blinds allowed some light to filter through in which Wilbur could see 
curls of cigarette smoke silhouetted. He sneezed again. Carlow looked down at a cigar 
in an ashtray on his desk. Oh! Allergic to the smoke, eh? Here, Ill get rid of it for you. 
Carlow picked up the cigar, took one last puff and then smashed it into oblivion against 
the glass of the ashtray. So what can I do for you? Carlow asked Wilbur. Well, sir, 
that is the problem. I have some vacation time, but I cant decide where in the world to 
go! Do you have a budget for this trip? the travel agent asked. Wilbur looked down 
at his feet, embarrassed. Im not rich, but I dont have any family, so I have quite a bit 
saved up from all those years of working at the factory. FACTORY! FACTORY! a voice 
screeched from the back corner of the room, causing Wilbur to jump out of his chair.

Whos going to watch The Watchmen?
Comicons newsblog (www.comicon.com/thebeat) 
reported that Paramount Pictures is officially 
working on an adaptation of Alan Moores The 
Watchmen (www.watchmenmovie.com). My
personal distress over the gravity of this situation 
might not be immediately clear to you, my dearest 
readers, so allow me to elucidate with an analogy: 
The Watchmen is to superhero comics as Neon 
Genesis Evangelion is to sentai mecha anime. Can you 
imagine the terrific horror of watching live-action 
Eva? The Watchmen movie stands to be even more 
absurd! The push in movies to produce as many 
comic adaptations as possible has this fundamental 
flaw: There are only so many popular, recognizable 
superheroes that make successful movies. Adapting 
a cult comic to which the target audience is most 
likely going to respond with fierce negativity is mere 
money-wasting. Watchmen only works as a comic.
Take, for instance, the traditional zen-like ritual 
for reading the comic that has been passed down 
from fanboy to fanboy for over two decades. 
The full procedure requires an entire week of 
concentration. You can only read one issue a day, 
and only during the evening, without distractions. 
Its difficult, because the story just sucks you in, but 
if you dont pace yourself you wont catch all the 
important subtleties. After the last night, you will 
enter the seventh circle and reach a higher state of 
consciousness. Honest. Do you think an over-budget 
movie can do any justice to that?
In keeping with additional terms of the tradition, I 
cannot reveal even the most mundane aspects of the 
story to you. Instead Ill write of its magnanimous 
author, Alan Moore.
To begin at the beginning, Wikipedia enlightened me 
to a tidbit about the start of his career I didnt know 
before: Moore began his career as a cartoonist, 
drawing underground-style strips for various pub
lications under pseudonyms such as Curt Vile and 
Jill de Ray. He went on to write stories for British 
comic magazines like 2000 AD. At this time he 
created the popular comics V For Vendetta and 
Miracleman. V For Vendetta has been pitched for a 
movie adaption too. The Wachowski brothers want 
to direct it. Shoot me.
Entering the 80s, Len Wein at DC comics picked 
up Moore to write Swamp Thing in the American 
mainstream. His successful reanalysis of the char
acter with artists Stephen R. Bissette, Rick Veitch
18
and John Totleben enabled him to begin creating 
his own stories. It was at this time that he created 
Watchmen. His reputation put him on par with other 
80s greats, such as Neil Gaiman, Art Spiegelman, 
and the Hernandez brothers. At this time he began 
to shirk conventions and fans, gaining a reputation 
as a reclusive legend.
Taking a cue from self-publishing advocate David 
Simm, he attempted for a while to publish comics 
independently through a small company called 
Mad Love, but finances soon wiped out, and he 
circulated a few other small publishers before 
returning to the mainstream. Memorable comics 
from this period are Lost Girls and A Small Killing. 
Another great book he wrote at this time, From Hell, 
was coincidentally made into a movie that tanked. 
Go figure. Eventually he joined Image Comics 
Wildstorm Studios just as they were being sold to 
DC, and he found himself awkwardly writing for 
DC again. In this arrangement hes written three 
contemporary comics that have received critical 
acclaim.
Tom Strong and Promethea both deal very much 
with the pulp tradition of comics. Tom Strong is an 
homage to a 1920s science-adventure hero named 
Tom Strange, and Promethea is the archetypal 
version of the mystics whose presence in comics 
disappeared in all but Marvels Doctor Strange in 
the 1960s. Both are somewhat meta-ironic, in the 
sense that they parody their subject in a way that 
expresses interest, admiration, and love.
Finally, The League of Extraordinary Gentleman is a 
tongue-in-cheek look at the relationship between 
British culture and the very American idea of 
superheroes. The comic is rife with Victorian 
allusions, and artist Kevin ONeil brings the subtlety 
to life. The horrible well-known movie adaptation 
has nothing to do with this comic apart from the 
title and the names of the characters; a terrible 
precedent in the context of the details-still-sketchy 
Watchmen project.
I feel so lonely in this matter; please keep me 
company. Read Watchmen, give it to all your friends, 
and mourn the horrible social stigma that the movie 
is going to place on the until-now-never-popular 
book. I think Im going to go cry now.
