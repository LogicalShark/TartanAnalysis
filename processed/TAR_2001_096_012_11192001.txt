OLR server plagued by 
slow speeds, shut downs
by Sara Henneberger
News Editor
Each semester during course 
selection week, students hunch over 
their computers anxiously awaiting 
the exact moment when they can 
sign up for courses through the OnLine Registration (OLR) system. 
Added to last weeks usual registra
tion headaches of course reserva
tions, waidists, and overloads was 
the falter of the HUBs OLR system 
during one of the most performance
 crucial times of the year. The OLR 
server suffered from periodic speed 
problems and outages over several 
days, with the most severe problems 
occurring on Wednesday and 
Thursday.
Sophomores and first-year stu
dents suffered most seriously from 
the OLR server problems, with the 
bulk of system errors transpiring on 
their registration days. Some stu
dents were unable to access the serv
er during their designated half hour 
registration periods and others 
found that they had free access to
the system regardless of their regis
tration time slots.
At my scheduled OLR time, the 
Web site was completely inaccessi
ble, as was SIO (Student 
Information On-Line), said Lisa 
Campus, a sophomore chemical 
engineering major. After approxi
mately 45 minutes of attempting to 
load the page, it finally came up and 
I could register.
I was not able to register until 1.5 
hours after my registration time, 
said Typhanie Zhuge, a sophomore 
business administration major. I 
even called Computing Services 
where the automated response 
transferred me to the place where 
you can report a major network out
age, and they were no help. They 
just told me to wait until Computing 
Services got in at 9 am, and I tried 
calling the HUB, too, but no one was 
there.
I actually registered for my class
es early due to a glitch in the sys
tem, said Jorge Vittes, a sophomore 
computer science major. I thought

DESPITE AGREEMENT ON CONTRACT, FMS 
EMPLOYEES EXPRESS DISAPPOINTMENT
by Justin Ker
Staffwriter
After the vote that approved the 
new contract between Facilities 
Management (FMS) and the 
University, one FMS worker 
expressed utter disbelief: We got 
nothing we wanted, and they [the 
University] got everything they 
wanted. The University shouldnt 
take things away from you just to 
show that they can  its a question 
of ethics. Well, if theyre going to 
treat us like garbage, sooner or later, 
they are going to get garbage.
At the vote on Thursday, 
November 8, FMS employees reluctantiy voted 45 to 33 in favor of the 
new contract. Many felt that it was 
futile to keep fighting with Carnegie 
Mellons Human Resources.
The management drew the line 
and wasnt budging, said John 
Hesch, the union representative for 
FMS. Workers could either accept 
the contract or strike. They didnt 
want to accept the contract, but 
decided it was better than striking.
At the time of the vote, FMS 
employees had worked under an 
expired contract for five months and 
believed they had little ammunition 
against a university that could afford 
to wait out a prolonged contract dis
pute. Even workers who had voted 
in favor of the contract expressed 
dismay, as they felt they had little 
choice in their vote; it was a matter 
of receiving either a five percent 
pension in 2005 under the current 
contract or an eight percent pension 
in 2005 under the new contract. 
Workers had originally requested a 10 percent pension.
All FMS workers will receive a 
one-time sign-on bonus of $300, 
except for craft mechanics, who will
receive $375. Hesch explained that 
the sign-on bonuses are meant to 
make up for the Universitys refusal 
to meet the workers wage demands 
or to pay back wages for the months 
the employees worked without a 
contract.
According to Hesch, the contract 
still requires ratification by all par
ties. He is currently working with 
Barbara Smith, vice president of

sion raise as we feel that the entire 
package is quite fair. When you look

The new contract includes the 
implementation of a policy to sub
ject employees to drug and alcohol 
testing. Many workers think [the 
drug and alcohol testing policy] is 
unfair and illegal, but it will be 
implemented for the entire FMS 
department on July 2, 2002, said 
Hesch.

CMU, Pitt see biotech as regional catalyst
by Mayank Bubna
Staffwriter
Despite a sluggish economy, 
biotechnology has not lost the 
momentum in its wheels. 
Speaking last Thursday night at 
the annual meeting of the 
Allegheny Conference on 
Community Development, 
Precision Therapeutics Chief 
Executive Officer Sean 
McDonald singled out biotech
nology as the groups key priori
ty for next year. The forum drew 
about 150 biotech leaders and 
other venture capitalists from 
outside the Pittsburgh region, 
testifying to the fact that the 
biotech industry has grown vast
ly in Western Pennsylvania.
Pittsburgh BioVenture, the 
secretive plan to increase the 
biotech industry in Pittsburgh, 
was a top priority of the confer
ence, and officials are expected 
to reveal the details of the plan 
next week. BioVenture officials 
will likely appeal for about $33
to $40 million from the state and $100 million from local founda
tions in financial backing.
BioVenture is supported by 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
University of Pittsburgh, and a 
multitude of other economic 
development groups. CMU has 
surprising strength in a number 
of biotech-related niches, includ
ing most prominently imaging 
and neuroscience, bone and tis
sue engineering, medical 
devices, and tools for drug dis
covery, said Don Smith Jr., spe
cial assistant to the President for 
Economic Development,
explaining why the University is 
involved in the BioVenture initia
tive. These strengths are highly 
complementary to the many 
strengths of the University of 
Pittsburgh and UPMC, giving the 
region an enviable array of acad
emic assets. Also, the commer
cial side of biotech is moving 
quickly to a point of convergence 
with information technology 
and biotechnology meeting. 
Areas such as medical informat
ics, computational biology, and 
tools for drug discovery, leverage 
the deep informational technol
ogy and engineering strength of 
CMU. Finally, collaboration with 
Pitt and the regions civic leader
ship is both good for CMU and 
good for the regions economy  
making this kind of project a 
high priority.
This has been an ongoing 
effort between Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of Pittsburgh, 
who have been talking about it 
for several months now, said 
Kyle Fisher Morabito, assistant 
vice president for University 
Relations. The partnership 
between the University of 
Pittsburgh and Life Sciences 
Greenhouse is part but not all of 
Carnegie Mellons overall inter
est in biotechnology. BioVenture 
represents a package of biotech
nology assets that are being 
packaged with the University of 
Pittsburghs expertise and the 
states Life Sciences Greenhouse 
effort.

President supportive yet

dent leaders comment
by Chris Chung
Special Projects Manager
Carnegie Mellon faculty gener
ally approve of President Jared 
Cohons job performance, having 
said that they are confident in his 
executive abilities and comfortable 
with his administrative actions. 
However, most undergraduate stu
dents have displayed an over
whelming lack of knowledge of the 
Presidents duties. Furthermore, 
those undergraduate and graduate 
students who remain in the dark 
have negatively rated the 
Presidents interaction with the 
University student body.
According to the survey that 
appeared in last weeks Tartan, 99 
percent of undergraduate students 
believe that the quality of 
President Cohons interaction with 
students is mediocre or worse. 
Undergraduate and graduate stu
dents from a variety of back
grounds say that that there is room 
for improvement in Cohons inter
action with students on both an 
individual basis and within stu
dent organizations. Many feel that

59 percent of undergraduates rated President Cohons interaction with students 
below average. Nearly half of graduate students gave Cohon a failing mark.'
while President Cohon is unarguably busy with numerous 
administrative and fundraising 
duties, he could increase his campu^ interaction through the venue 
of student organizations.
According to Dean Michael 
Murphy, President Cohon rarely 
turns down an invitation to stu
dent events. However, regular 
appearances at various student 
meetings and events without for
mal invitations might allow stu
dents to feel a closer connection to 
their President and a stronger 
inclination to approach the 
President with concerns or sugges

Kunduz airstrikes prompt 
conditional Taliban surrender
Government probes student records at Georgetown
BANGI, Afghanistan (AP)  
Defenders of the last Taliban strong
hold in northern Afghanistan made 
a conditional offer of surrender 
Sunday after a day of devastating 
US airstrikes, the opposition north
ern alliance said.
US B-52s led a day of intense 
bombing on Taliban positions out
side the city of Kunduz, sending 
huge fireballs skyward. On Sunday 
evening, an opposition commander 
said the Taliban had offered to give 
up provided there was a guarantee 
of safety for foreign fighters loyal to 
Osama bin Laden.
Refugees fleeing the city of 
Kunduz over the weekend, mean
while, told of terror at the hands of 
Taliban troops and bin Laden loyal
ists. One described a doctor shot and 
killed for not treating a wounded 
Taliban fast enough, and others said 
eight teenage boys were killed for 
laughing at Taliban soldiers.
Witnesses also said at least 100 
Taliban soldiers were shot, appar
ently by gunmen from their own 
side, as they approached northern 
alliance lines in an attempt to sur
render.
The conditional surrender offer 
was reported by an opposition com
mander, Nahidullah, who said it was 
made during negotiations conduct
ed by radio with the Taliban. The 
Taliban said they would surrender if 
the alliance guaranteed that nonAfghans fighting alongside them 
would not be killed and if the sur
render were witnessed by United 
Nations representatives.
There are an estimated 3,000 
non-Afghans fighting with the 
Taliban in Kunduz, including Arabs 
believed to be affiliated with bin 
Ladens al-Qaida terrorist network, 
as well as Pakistanis.
There was no immediate word 
whether the opposition alliance has 
accepted the offer.
Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a pri
vate news agency said US bombard
ment of Taliban positions in their 
home base of Kandahar in the south 
and outside the eastern city of 
Jalalabad had killed more than 70 
people overnight. The reports could 
not be independently confirmed.
The latest American bombard
ment of Taliban lines outside 
Kunduz used the largest bombs yet 
unleashed in the area. Flames shot 
into the air, and cracking booms 
echoed across the valley floor 
toward the northern alliances own 
foxholes in opposing ridges. 
Avalanches of soil cascaded down 
the targeted hillsides.
Taliban soldiers could be seen 
running out on the distant ridges, 
trying to find cover.
Northern alliance forces had 
moved a multiple-rocket launcher 
and two tanks up to the road that is 
the eastern approach to Kunduz, but 
there was no sign an attack was 
imminent.
Refugees fleeing Kunduz over the 
past several days have said the city is 
under the control of Arab, Pakistani, 
Chechen and other foreign fighters 
 and a hard core of Taliban fight
ers from Kandahar.
In and near Bangi, a village about 
30 miles east of Kunduz, refugees 
gave chilling accounts of conditions 
inside the city.
The Taliban were barring people 
from leaving, telling them, If you 
leave, the USA will bomb all the 
city, said a refugee named Dar 
Zardad. He said he made it out of 
the city only after Taliban beat him 
with their rifle butts.
Zardad described the killing in 
Kunduz of a group of boys in their 
late teens by Taliban from Kandahar 
after some of the youths laughed at 
them. He and others also recounted 
how troops shot and killed a doctor 
when he delayed responding to their 
summons to come treat wounded 
Taliban fighters.
Refugees said people of the city 
were hiding indoors and closing 
their shops for fear of summary exe
cution by the Taliban. Foreign fight
ers, using local translators, were 
broadcasting loudspeaker
announcements saying they would 
be taking the offensive agairtst 
northern alliance troops laying siege 
to the city.
The reports of bombings in east
ern Nangarhar province and in 
Kandahar came from the Afghan 
Islamic Press. It said the Nangarhar 
raid killed 30 people, and quoted a 
Pakistani official at the nearby 
Torkham border crossing as saying 
seven wounded were brought to 
Pakistan for treatment.
It also said US jets struck targets 
around Kandahar, killing 46 people, 
as the stalemate continued over con
trol of the Taliban stronghold.
In the capital, Kabul, U.N. envoy 
Francesc Vendrell was trying to help 
work out a plan for a new Afghan 
government. The former president, 
Burhanuddin Rabbani, returned to 
Kabul on Saturday for the first time 
in five years.
Rabbani has never relinquished 
his claim to the presidency, though 
he has acknowledged the interna
tional calls for a broad-based gov
ernment that would include all of 
Afghanistans ethnic groups.
A White House official, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said 
Saturday that the United States has 
been pressuring the northern 
alliance to share power with other 
factions and to let the United 
Nations oversee assembly of a new 
government. US officials are in the 
region and in direct contact with the 
alliance, he said.
Vendrell said he had a preliminary 
meeting with Rabbanis acting for
eign minister, Abdullah, on Sunday. 
He described the exchange as cor
dial but said no outstanding issues 
were resolved.
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON  
Federal agencies have made at least 
one request for the release of confi
dential records of Georgetown 
University students, University offi
cials said this week.
Although Assistant Vice President 
for Communications Julie Green 
Bataille said she could not give spe
cific details about the request, she 
said the university did not a receive a 
blanket request for information 
about multiple students.
Out of respect for the privacy 
rights of current and former stu
dents, faculty and staff, we will not 
provide details about any specific 
request in order to maintain the con
fidentiality of that information 
Green Bataille said.
The Counsels office is making 
sure that any such request is handled 
consistent with the law and with full
respect for the individuals privacy 
rights, Green Bataille said.
University Registrar John Q. 
Pierce said his office has not received 
any requests for non-directory infor
mation since the September 11 
attacks.
However, Pierce noted that even 
before the attacks, the Immigration 
and Natural Services Agency have 
always had the right to request cer
tain information about students 
studying at Georgetown with inter
national student visas. The Office of 
International Programs would 
respond to those requests in the 
usual course of business, Pierce 
said.
The release of student informa
tion, particularly of those who hold 
international visas, follows the dis
covery that several of the terrorists 
responsible for the September 11
attacks illegally entered the United 
States with student visas.
Pierce said the University plans to 
use the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act of 1974 as its guide 
in releasing non-directory informa
tion.
The law, which aims to safeguard 
the privacy of students, says that a 
university cannot give access to a 
students records to another group 
or person without the students writ
ten consent. According to 
Georgetowns undergraduate stu
dent bulletin, student records will be 
released to persons in compliance 
with a judicial order or a lawfully 
issued subpoena [provided that the 
university will first make a reason
able attempt to notify the student]
According to the Department of 
Education, records can also be 
released without student consent in
Leonids meteor shower delights many
MOUNT WILSON, Calif. (AP)  
This years much-anticipated 
Leonids shower delighted people 
around the world who stayed up 
late or woke up early to see it.
Even though the display was less 
intense than the 4,000 per hour 
some had predicted, NASA 
astronomer Tony Phillips said it was 
the most spectacular one since 
1966, and was more of a storm than 
a shower.
The best viewing in the United 
States was between 4 am and 6 am 
EST, but on the East Coast, people 
reported seeing meteors fly even 
after dawn broke, Phillips said in a 
telephone interview from Bishop, 
Calif., as the meteor storm raged.
The Leonids are minute dust par
ticles shed by Comet Tempel-Tuttle. 
The meteors are called Leonids
because they appear to come from 
the direction of the constellation 
Leo the Lion.
. The comet swings around the sun 
once every 33 years, leaving a trail 
of dust. Each November, the Earths 
orbit takes it through that slowly 
dissipating trail.
Comet Tempel-Tuttle most 
recently passed close to the sun in 
February 1998. However, the dust 
particles seen as shooting stars 
across North America on Sunday 
were shed during a 1766 pass.
Those particles, each no larger 
than a grain of sand, enter the 
atmosphere traveling 45 miles a 
second. When they meet the fric
tion of air molecules, they bum up 
harmlessly, leaving only a brilliant 
streak of light.
But for the estimated 630 opera
tional satellites in orbit around the 
Earth, the particles can be deadly. 
Many satellite operators, in prepa
ration for the shower, turn the 
spacecraft to shield them from the 
meteoroids or shut down electronic 
operations.
Comets are believed to contain 
pristine examples of the materials 
that coalesced 4.5 billion years ago 
to form the solar system. The frozen 
balls of ice and debris are rich with 
basic elements like iron, as well as 
carbon-based molecules. Some sci
entists believe this is how Earth was 
seeded with organic compounds 
when it was repeatedly pelted with 
comets early in its history.
At least four US and European 
spacecraft missions are expected to 
study comets from up close over the 
next decade.

RENO, Nevada (AP)  Jurors 
spent a day of deliberations 
Saturday still disagreeing on 
whether a wealthy art appraiser 
killed his wife the way prosecu
tors say: by deliberately crashing 
their truck through a guardrail 
and jumping out as the vehicle 
went over a cliff.
The murder trial of Peter 
Bergna took another dramatic 
turn Friday when one juror said 
the panel was deadlocked partly 
because a holdout believes God 
would punish Bergna if he really 
killed his wife. The move prompt
ed a defense motion for a mistrial, 
but the judge refused. The jury 
were to resume deliberations 
Monday.
Bergnas wife, Rinette RiellaBergna, an international tour 
guide, had just returned to Reno 
the night of May 31, 1998, after 
six weeks in Italy. Bergna picked 
her up at the airport, and on the 
way home, turned onto the dead
end road near Lake Tahoe. He 
told police they went there to talk 
about his desire for her to quit her 
job and stay home.
Bergna said his wife promised 
to cut back on her travel, and they
started toward their home in 
Incline Village. They were stop
ping at a pullout to take in the 
view when the truck brakes 
failed, Bergna told police.
What happened next has filled 
six weeks of the jurys time, both 
in court and even out with a jury 
trip to the site of the crash.
The defense has argued that 
Bergna, 48, was thrown from the 
truck as it went over the cliff. He 
called for help from a cell phone, 
and rescuers found him on the 
mountainside about 80 feet below 
the road with a broken foot. His 
49-year-old wife was dead far 
below.
Bergna was questioned by 
police at the time, but no charges 
were filed until an indictment was 
returned a year ago and Bergna 
was arrested.
Defense experts testified that 
fibers consistent with the trucks 
airbag were found on Bergna, 
showing he must have been inside 
when it hit the guardrail.
Prosecution witnesses testified 
that Bergnas shoes had been 
marked by asphalt, showing he 
must have dragged them on the 
road above.
Prosecutors argued that Bergna 
set up the crash and jumped out 
just in time while his wife plunged 
more than 700 feet to her death. 
Witnesses testified that he was 
upset about his wifes travel, and 
two other women told jurors 
Bergna asked them for dates just 
before the crash.
Washoe County prosecutor 
David Clifton said Friday he 
believes the jury is leaning toward 
conviction. On Thursday, a juror 
sent the judge a note saying the 
jury was deadlocked 9-3.
A different juror sent a note to 
the judge Friday that said: One 
of the jurors told me I cannot give 
a guilty verdict because I couldnt 
live with myself later if I found 
out he was innocent.
He then got choked up and 
stated he (Mr. Bergna) would live 
with his guilt and that God would 
take care of him, the note said. I 
truly believe that this is compro
mising our vote and we will not be 
able to bring this to a decision.
Defense attorney David Smith 
said it just means the juror thinks 
the state failed to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Bergna is 
guilty.

Among the 220 universities

Some universities have resisted

Tufts University officials only 
reluctantly handed over data about 
foreign students, who constitute

Fishermen 
survivefive 
months at sea
SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  Two 
fishermen survived almost five 
months adrift on the Pacific Ocean 
in a small metal boat by catching fish 
and birds and drinking rainwater, 
one of the survivors and a doctor 
said Monday.
Two other men died during the 
torrid journey, which saw them drift 
nearly 2,480 miles west from 
Western Samoa to Papua New 
Guinea.
Lafaili Tofi, 36, and Telea Paa, 27, 
were extremely lucky to be alive, 
said Dr. Barry Kirby from Alotau 
Hospital in eastern Papua New 
Guinea.
Basically they survived on the 
rainwater they got while they were 
drifting, some small fish which they 
caught and also some birds which 
landed on the... vessel, Kirby said in 
a telephone interview.
The men were fishing off thennative Western Samoa on June 20 
when a huge load of fish dragged 
their 20-foot aluminum boat under 
water.
The men righted the well-built 
boat by cutting away the fishing lines 
and two outboard motors but were 
left powerless as currents pushed 
them out into open ocean, missing 
many islands on the journey, Kirby 
said. Several ships passed by, but 
none came to their rescue.
The survivors were finally rescued 
last week by a villager on Normanby 
Island in Milne Bay, Papua New 
Guinea, who paddled out to them 
after they fired off their last flare.
They suffered from exposure and 
were basically on a starvation diet, 
he said.
One man is unable to walk. The 
other man was quite strong consid
ering his ordeal. Kirby said both 
men were stable and recovering 
well.
In a telephone conversation with 
the AP from his hospital bed, Tofi 
said he had been scared and doubted 
he would survive.
I am feeling well now, he said.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 19, 2001
If You Want To Get

Student groups provide 
venue for interaction
FMS workers reach contract agreement 
despite substance testing policy disputes
OLR glitches 
will undergo 
investigationFMS, from page A1 
They want to test us for drugs, for 
alcohol, and they will do it, although 
I believe this is unconstitutional, 
said one worker who wished to 
remain anonymous. If you want to 
test people for drugs, make it fair 
and implement it campus wide; or is 
drinking and taking drugs wrong 
only when us blue collared folks do 
it? I feel like a second class citizen. 
When asked how drug and alcohol 
testing of FMS employees will be 
implemented, Smith said she would 
have to go talk to the FMS 
Management and discuss it, as we 
have not worked it out.
Jeffrey Bolton, vice president of 
Business and Planning, believes a 
fair procedure was followed during 
the contract negotiations between 
FMS employees and the University. 
The University negotiated direcdy 
with the elected representatives of
percent increment that is supposed 
to be spread over the next four years. 
So we got together and decided that 
we wanted to put 10 percent of it into 
our pension, and forego a higher 
wage raise for the next couple of 
years. Cuz you know, a lot of these 
guys are in their 40s and 50s. Were 
going to retire soon, and wed all 
want some security. So we get back 
to her, and she says, No, to our pro
posal.
And the reason she gives, is that 
the University staff who all have 
been getting 8 percent pension will 
not be happy with the FMS propos
als. This is ridiculous, and this is the 
exact same thing they have been 
telling us for the past ten years. We 
(FMS employees) have been getting 
5 percent pension a year for as long 
as I can remember, and they keep 
coming back with the same line. You 
cant even compare 8 percent of 
what they make to 5 percent of what 
I make  its ridiculous. Ive been 
working at Carnegie Mellon for 
almost thirty years, and is it too 
much to ask for a lousy pension?
In response to alleged University 
complaints of unsatisfactory work 
performed by FMS workers, the 
same employee said, Of course its 
unsatisfactory. Transfer the worst 
people from all over the University 
contractors into FMS and what do 
they expect? Ten years ago, we were 
an elite crew of 330, and today, were 
77 strong, with management prob
lems all the way up. We got some 
good people^ and then we got those 
who call in sick all the time. [The 
University] wants us to do our work, 
but they wont provide the equip
ment. If the plumbing somewhere is 
leaking, we first need to get a work 
order, and wait for it to be approved 
by management before we can actu
ally get the equipment to do the job. 
And all this time the water just keeps 
on leaking.
According to Hesch, worker 
morale is at an all-time low. We 
have a lot of very unsatisfied 
workers and its something that 
needs to be dealt with in the 
future, said Hesch. There is a lot 
of distrust between the union and 
the management. There are many 
problems to be resolved, but well 
hope for a better contract next 
time.
impaired co-workers. The [contract] 
negotiation process is not the appro
priate vehicle for working out the 
details of the implementation. 
Rather, a labor management com
mittee is provided for by the contract 
and is the channel that will be used 
to develop the implementation 
plan.
Entrenched problems
C0H0N, from page A1 
her comments as well, and said 
that while the Womens Center 
does not have many major 
events, Cohon could use his 
position as University President 
to raise the awareness of groups 
which typically garner less 
attention than others.
It may help the Womens 
Center just by him showing sup
port for our organization, said 
Deutsch. Many of our events 
are pretty low-key and it proba
bly wouldnt accomplish much 
for him to be at those types of 
events, but the public voicing of 
his support could help the 
Womens Centers image on 
campus, said Deutsch.
Deutsch added that Cohon 
could try setting up meetings 
with various student organiza
tions to better understand their 
needs, and that he could be 
helpful in both raising aware
ness of groups to the rest of the 
campus and helping groups find 
support and funding though 
connections he has on campus.
Some student organization 
representatives were more posi
tive about Cohons interaction, 
approving of the job he is doing 
in communicating with them. 
Cohon has reached out to some 
student leaders, inviting them to 
personally speak to him about 
their organizations.
I would estimate that 
[President Cohons] visibility 
with IFC and the Greek 
Community is, if anything, the 
same or higher than with similar 
student organizations, said 
Andy Butts, a senior information 
systems major and the public 
relations chair for Interfraternity 
Council (IFC). President Cohon 
has invited the leaders of the 
Greek Community to join him 
for Saturday football games.
In some cases, students see it 
as their responsibility to involve 
Cohon in the activities of their 
organization. Increased inter
action and visibility are always 
great, said Butts. It would be 
great to see him at more studentsponsored events. However, 
its our responsibility to involve 
him more than it is his to proac
tively seek involvement.
Butts suggested that President 
Cohon could interact with a 
larger number of students 
through a relatively simple activ
ity: Stopping by popular student 
hang-outs. Between classes, the 
Fence and in front of Doherty 
Hall are some of the most highlytrafficked areas  many stu
dents stop to chat with friends 
and hang out before running to 
their next class. Perhaps if 
[President Cohon] were to be 
visible at these times, it would 
help students put a name to a 
face with greater ease, said 
Butts.
President Cohon meets at least 
once a semester with two advisory 
student organizations: the
Presidents Student Advisory 
Committee (PSAC) and the Black 
Student Advisory Council (BSAC).
Hes fairly positive, said 
Gilbert Dussek, a sophomore 
electrical and engineering major 
and a member of BSAC, refer
ring to the suggestions for 
improving campus life for 
Carnegie Mellons underrepre
sented minority populations 
posed by BSAC. He added that 
although the suggestions made 
by the BSAC are received well by 
President Cohon, he cant 
implement them right away 
because they are long-term 
goals.
Overall, Dussek believes that 
its necessary for the President 
to have a closer relationship 
with the student body and to 
have a presence on campus. 
Its not always about money, 
he said, echoing the sentiments 
of other students who believe 
that the President has the poten
tial to play a major role in shap
ing the climate of the campus.
Increased presidential visibil
ity and interaction could help 
students feel that the President 
genuinely cares about studnets 
and their organizations and 
activities. Its a school spirit and 
morale booster, said Butts.
Chad Hermann, a communica
tions lecturer within the 
Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration contends that 
president-student interaction is 
a difficult topic at any university. 
Its a very interesting issue. Part 
of the problem that I see is that a 
university president, by the very 
definition of what he or she has 
to do, isnt cut out for regular, 
daily communication with stu
dents.
Prior to coming to CMU, 
Hermann taught at Duquesne 
University, where thenPresident John Murray led the 
schools improvement in fiscal 
matters and reputation. Murray 
excelled at increasing the 
schools endowment, but many 
students saw him as a failure 
because of his distant relation
ship. Duquesne has tried to 
counter the problem with an 
approach employed by many 
institutions: having separate 
vice presidents for academics 
and student affairs that could 
relate policies to the student 
body.
Hermann purported that in 
any large organization, the fig
urehead must communicate 
through his or her lieutenants.
Having good people working 
underneath them [university 
presidents] who can be their 
eyes and ears, Hermann said, is 
essential to an informed and 
responsive university leader.
Hermann noted that the gen
eral unuse of President Cohons 
student office hours might be 
examined more closely to deter
mine if increased publicity is 
needed to attract students to 
what could be a valuable inter
action with the University 
leader.
Does the student community 
really know when those hours 
are and that they are available? 
Hermann inquired.
He also noted that increased 
visibility on campus by the 
President could bridge the gap 
between perception and reality 
regarding what students view 
President Cohon as and what he 
actually does.
As more and more students 
see President Cohon at events, 
interact personally with him, or 
know others who have interact
ed with him, the current percep
tion of a low-visibility president 
would almost undoubtedly shift.
Its the old adage about tak
ing your message to the stu
dents, said Hermann. He juxta
posed a politician who poses for 
photo opportunities and attends 
community functions regularly 
and a university president. At 
the risk of seeming too political, 
Cohon could make strides to 
make his appearances more pro
nounced or more frequent 
Hermann said.
Brad Grantz, Aseem Gupta, and 
Sara Henneberger contributed to 
this article.
OLR, from page A1 
that since I had access to it, probably 
everybody did, so I figured I should 
register before the classes filled up.
Despite moments of server shut
down along with veritable schedul
ing free-for-alls during what is nor
mally a carefully structured registra
tion schedule, enrollment adminis
trators maintained that the problems 
were merely a glitch.
According to Darleen Labarbera, 
the director of Enrollment Systems, 
the weeklong problems were an 
anomaly and were unexpected since 
OLRs performance application is 
exactly the same as in the past. 
Labarbera explained that the OLR 
system has had few problems since its 
initial launch during the spring of 
1997. However, during a system 
reboot last Wednesday, the OLR serv
er experienced a software problem 
and the file that held time assign
ments was not requeued into the 
server. The error was discovered after 
Computing Services received email 
from two students. On Thursday, the 
OLR server was closely monitored to 
ensure that the system did not open 
up as it had the previous day.
It just worked out that the net
working problems happened during 
OLR week, said Linda Anderson, 
vice president of Enrollment 
Services.
Labarbera said that Computing 
Services has received limited criti
cism from students as a result of the 
OLR difficulties, and that complaints 
from sophomores and first-year stu
dents have been constructive.
Feedback from students was quite 
minimal, said Anderson.
Some students believe that the 
tight scheduling structure that allows 
a new group of students to register 
for classes every half an hour should 
be expanded to account for server 
troubles.
Maybe they could try to extend 
each time slot to an hour and add 
another day for each class to register, 
redistributing the number of people 
getting in to the server, said Nancy 
Chen, a sophomore computer science 
major.
Other students feel that more sup
port from Computing Services staff 
could expedite communication about 
server problems.
I believe that it would be incredi
bly helpful on OLR days to have 
someone available at the HUB in case 
of problems, said Campus. Being 
unable to access the system and hav
ing no way of informing anyone 
about it, let alone getting the situa
tion resolved, was not only ineffi
cient, but frustrating.
With class registration conducted 
entirely online, students may feel 
that they have few options in the case 
of OLR system difficulties. The 
importance of the OLR system at 
Carnegie Mellon is magnified, as it 
impacts the course selections of the 
entire student body.
We should be able to use [an 
online system] to change classes, but 
I think we should have a choice of 
either going to [academic] coun
selors to register or registering 
online, said Zhuge.
According to Labarbera,
Computing Services and
Administrative Computing and
Information Services (ACIS) are cur
rently investigating the cause of the 
OLR server problems, which will 
come under further scrutiny as the 
HUB moves towards other changes 
with OLR-related programs. The 
integration of OLR, SIO, and CIO 
(Course Information On-Line) is cur
rently being considered, although 
Labarbera does not believe imple
mentation of the plan will occur until 
sometime next semester.

Further complicating the initial 
financial stability of a major 
biotech venture is the long produc

tion process is also very extensive, 
said Fisher Morabito. It involves 
dozens of research programs, and 
working with a variety of organiza
tions. This requires careful plan
ning by all of the organizations 
involved to make the case for the 
states review.

get to market, other opportunities 
are available that are more near

Morabito said, Carnegie Mellon 
identifies biotechnology as a strate
gic area of focus for the University 
in the new century because of the 
growing market and the relevance 
of our areas of comparative advan
tage.
Funding for a city-wide biotech 
venture may prove to be a chal
lenge, as Pittsburgh will have to 
compete for the state money for 
which a group of university and 
business leaders from Philadelphia 
are already vying. The 
Philadelphia group has asked the 
state for funds equivalent to almost 
half of the $100 million pool of 
tobacco settlement money the 
state set aside earlier this year to
and takes a portfolio approach to 
meet the needs of both types of 
activity. I think that the 
Commonwealth has shown good 
recognition of the need to make 
both near and long term technolo
gy investments. I am confident that 
the state has recognized the impor
tance of biotechnology and will be 
a productive partner on this initia
tive.
Smith is confident that 
BioVenture will benefit the 
Pittsburgh area in many intercon
nected arenas. The project 
promises to improve academic sci
ence in the region, and to create a 
commercialization environment 
that is conducive to startups and 
providing important benefits to 
both the academic community and 
the regions economy, said Smith.

Celica
The Inside Story
On the outside, it's easy to see that Celica is race-track 
inspired. But the real excitement is on the inside...under the 
hood. Take the Celica GT-S...Toyota worked with Yamaha to 
build a 180 HP engine redlined at 7800 RPM...equipped it 
with Variable Valve Timing with intelligence...a computer 
that constantly monitors and retunes your engine for maxi
mum performance...a fcam with two sets of lobes to provide 
two ranges of valve lift and duration for more usable horse
power. There's direct ignition for greater reliability... 
iridium-tipped spark plugs for reduced maintenance...a 
stainless steel exhaust manifold...a water-cooled oil cooler. 
And mated with Toyota's 4-speed electronically-controlled 
automatic "Sportshift", you get transmission shift switches 
on the steering wheel...just like Formula 1 race cars. Sweet
because now your Toyota dealer has a special college graduate 
financing program available thru Toyota Financial Services 
that offers a lot of great advantages.
So if you're within 4 months of graduation... or if you graduated 
within the past two years...See your Toyota dealer for details.

Traffic jam: OLR reliability, 
usability issues need attention
As hundreds of students attempted to 
log in to the online registration system 
(OLR) last week, many were surprised to 
encounter slow speeds or no response at 
all. These problems added to the present 
dissatisfaction with OLR in regards to its 
failure to include Schedule-O-Matic and 
to integrate other HUB services into one 
destination point. Administrative 
Computing and Information Services 
(ACIS), along with Computing Services, 
must make a concerted effort to quickly 
address problems with registration tools.
The connection to OLR was slow 
throughout much of registration week, 
with problems peaking on Wednesday 
and Thursday, when the systems server 
went down. Students attempting to reg
ister for classes at 7 am on Wednesday 
and 12 pm on Thursday were frustrated 
by their inability to register at their 
appointed time. These problems were 
attributed to issues with the campus net
work, not with the OLR software. The 
software system is unchanged and has 
been running well for over three years.
However, on Wednesday afternoon 
some sophomore students discovered 
that they could enter OLR before their 
registration time. The entire sophomore 
class was given access to OLR after the 
system was rebooted without reentering 
the data that stored time assignments.
There was also some confusion over 
waitlists, with a number of first-year stu
dents reporting that they were waitlisted 
for classes required by their major. The
HUB should attempt to improve commu
nication with students about common 
registration problems, and OLR should 
provide more precise information about 
waitlists. In addition, staff should be 
available during registration hours to 
answer questions by phone. Several stu
dents tried calling during the 
Wednesday morning outage but were 
told no one was available to help yet.
Computing Services and ACIS must 
rapidly address any problems with OLR 
and implement improvements for the 
next semester. Although OLR only 
receives heavy use once per semester, it 
is a critical part of course registration. 
Online registration is a substantial 
improvement over paper and pencil reg
istration, but there are still significant 
changes needed with the system. One 
possible solution is to extend the length 
of time for registration and reduce the 
number of students at each registration 
time. This would alleviate some of the 
stress on the computer hardware and 
reduce the time pressure that students 
experience during registration. Further, 
the technical feasibility of having OLR 
available 24 hours a day has significant
ly increased since the system was first 
implemented. Enrollment Services 
must investigate the feasibility of having 
the system always available. 
Improvements to OLR should be a prior
ity since this service fulfills important 
functions in students ability to register 
for classes.
This is Forum: How opinions 
are expressed in The Tartan
Newspapers in general are relatively 
predictable  theres the news section, 
the sports sections, and the comics, usu
ally along with the living and entertain
ment sections. Often there is very little 
opportunity to respond to what we see 
in print. At The Tartan, we find a lot of 
value in the exchange and in the fre
quent clash of ideas, so we try to provide 
a spectrum of opinions to allow you, our 
readers, to be the judges.
To that end, youll find the following 
types of pieces in Forum:
Editorials always appear in the left
most columns of the first Forum page. 
They are unsigned because they repre
sent a consensus opinion of The Tartans 
editorial board.
While we believe our editorials offer 
sensible, accurate commentary, please 
feel free to disagree with us  we dont 
have a monopoly on the truth. As a mat
ter of fact, we would like to know what 
you think. An excellent means to do this 
is by writing a Letter to the Editor.
Letters to the Editor may be submitted 
by anybody, although when space gets 
tight, we will favor letters from mem
bers of the University community. As 
readers, you should realize that opin
ions represented in a letter are those of 
the author and not of The Tartan. All 
letters are subject to editing for size and 
grammar (letters should not exceed 350 
words). But we never edit a letter for 
content.
Of course, we reserve the right to 
reject letters that we feel are libelous, 
obscene, or incoherent. But well be 
glad to discuss any letter with the author 
and see if we can reach a compromise. 
However, in order to have such a discus
sion, we need to know who you are. We 
are willing to withhold a writers name 
in the paper in a Letter to the Editor, but 
our Editors-in-Chief do need to know 
who wrote it. Please dont send us 
anonymous letters  it just frustrates us 
because we have no way to contact you, 
and it annoys you because your letter 
doesnt get published.
Persons Opinion is just that  the 
opinion of randomly polled persons, 
usually students at CMU, on a different 
question or concern each week. The 
people in Persons Opinion have no affil
iation with The Tartan, and their opin
ions are not representative of those on 
The Tartans Editorial Board.
Columns are consistently-appearing 
opinion pieces presented by individuals 
who are members of the CMU communi
ty. We are looking to diversify the 
Forum section and encourage students, 
faculty and staff to write a column on 
something which interests them. 
Opinions in these columns are those of 
the columnist and not of The Tartan.
Again, feel free to disagree with them. 
Getting feedback lets us know that you 
are reading and thinking about The 
Tartan.

Letters to the Editorj
Cohon cares
Editors:
Comments in the November 12 Tartan on 
the perceived lack of presidential interac
tion with the CMU community (8,500 stu
dents, 3,000 faculty and staff, 50,000 alum
ni) brought to mind my own experiences 
with the president of the university I attend
ed as an undergraduate (Johns Hopkins). I 
first met Dr. Eisenhower at a reception for 
incoming freshmen. My second encounter 
was at my commencement four years later. 
I had no idea what the president of a uni
versity did and I didnt care. That I never 
saw him did not indicate to me a lack of 
interest or concern on his part. By contrast, 
Dr. Cohon is very visible here. If you want to 
talk to him about what he does, ask him at 
the Midnight Breakfast during finals where 
he will be cooking for the undergraduates 
as he does every semester.

Derogatory descriptor
Editors:
The November 12, 2001, issue of The 
Tartan contained a review of the popular
local restaurant Pasta Piatta written by 
Claire Jauregui and Meredith Wiggins. In 
this review, they describe the host of the 
restaurant as a younger, greaser Guido in a 
black cord shirt. Faux Pas. Later in the 
review, they again refer to the host as Guido.
While the authors were obviously try
ing to achieve a lighthearted and sarcastic 
tone in their review, that is simply no 
excuse for calling a man of apparently 
Italian descent a Guido. This term is 
highly offensive to Italians and ItalianAmericans; I simply cannot believe that a 
paper that purports to speak to the entire 
CMU community could let such a blatant
ly insulting term be used.
Ms. Wiggins and Ms. Jauregui, who 
describe the host as having committed a 
faux pas, have committed the true faux 
pas. They owe us an apology.

Were good, too
Editors:
Id like to make a few comments on the 
article in last weeks The Tartan reviewing 
the swimming/diving meet. I understand 
that in past years the articles have been
written by a swimmer or by someone 
closely related to the team. With this tran
sition, it might be hard for a newcomer to 
understand the history. However, thats 
no excuse for misrepresenting the facts.
There was a quote from the article, 
With the new talent the Tartans have 
in their first-year class, their diving per-' 
formance is no longer up in the air.v 
First of all, our performance was never 
up in the air. As a third-year diver, 
Ive placed at both conference meets 
Ive participated in, as has every other 
diver whos participated in those events 
since Ive been here. Our program, 
although small, is strong. The year 
before I came to CMU, we sent Brandon 
May to nationals. In the past two years, 
weve done very well in dual meets, 
invitationals, and championships. I will 
not deny that Mindi Finnegan is bring
ing very valuable depth to our program 
but her recent and early success is just 
that, her success and not in anyway to 
discount the hard work and accolades 
of the other present and past Carnegie 
Mellon divers.
I hope that youll consider this in you^ 
future articles.

When terrorists become freedom fighters
Yaron Rachlin
In a recent column in The Washington 
Post, Richard Cohen cites an Indian 
reporter who asked a question that I 
would like to ask the President myself. 
Sir, he cried out to George Bush last 
week at the White House, Why are there 
two laws in this world, one for America 
and one for the rest of us? When terror
ism hits America, you go halfway around 
the world and make war in Afghanistan. 
But when we suffer terrorism, you ask us 
to be restrained. Is an Indian life less pre
cious than ah American life?
While Muslim leaders around the world 
desperately seek to draw a distinction 
between terrorists (Osama and friends) 
and freedom fighters (whoever they are 
funding at the moment), Indian and 
Israeli citizens continue to be gunned 
down indiscriminately. The argument put 
forth is that violent action is a legitimate 
response to the Israeli occupation of 
Palestinian territories, and the Indian 
occupation of Kashmir. The question of 
the legitimacy of Indian and Israeli claims 
presents one core issue, but I think that a 
more pressing question ought to be 
answered first. Is violent action against 
innocent civilians ever a legitimate 
response to occupation, regardless of 
the validity of such occupation? If you 
are willing to concede that the murder of 
innocent civilians is a reasonable 
response in support of your political 
cause, then you enter a morally relativistic realm. This is a magical place where 
Osama bin Ladin has his own narrative, in 
which he is a brave fighter against the 
infidel Christians and Jews, and therefore 
any murderous action  including plow
ing planes loaded with people into office 
buildings  is merely the latest chapter in 
a heroic saga. Alternatively, if you sub
scribe to the old-fashioned notion that 
regardless of the nobility of your political 
cause, the ends do not justify the means, 
then you should conclude that turning 
away from a political solution and toward 
the path of violence against civilians 
makes you an inhuman murderer, not a 
freedom fighter.
On November 11, Pakistani President
(and dictator) Pervez Musharraf was a 
guest on NBCs Meet the Press. Tim 
Russert stated, The Indian government 
has said if youre against terrorism, you 
have to be against all terrorism. And 
many of the organizations that are creat
ing terrorism in Kashmir have roots in 
Pakistan. To this President Musharraf 
responded, They have moral support in 
Pakistan. Everything about the freedom 
struggle that is going on, I would like to 
differentiate. There is no terrorism going 
on in Kashmir. Well that clarifies every
thing. So on October 1 when a suicide 
squad of Jaish-e-Muhammad attacked the 
legislative council building of Jammu and 
Kashmir, they were simply engaged in a 
freedom struggle. In this particular 
attack, 38 people died and an additional 
52 were wounded. The victims include 27 
civilians, three elected officials, and a col
lege female. Why is Pakistan so eager to 
label the perpetrators of such bloody acts 
as freedom fighters? The answer is pro
vided in this statement made by Mr. Jack 
Cunningham, a member of the Labour 
Party (UK) and member of Parliament, in 
1994. In a press briefing he stated, There 
is a lot of evidence to suggest the insur
gency is organized, assisted, and trigdictator of Syria, defined these groups as 
freedom fighters, we, and I personally, 
differentiate between resistance and ter
rorism. Again let us consider specific 
instances. On August 9, 2001, a
Palestinian freedom fighter entered a 
Sbarro pizzeria in downtown Jerusalem 
and detonated a bomb that was packed 
with nails, screws, and bolts. The bomb 
completely gutted the restaurant, which 
was full of lunchtime customers. Fifteen 
people were killed, including seven chil
dren, and about 130 were injured. To 
make matters worse, many Palestinians, 
celebrated this blow for the freedom 
struggle by dancing in the streets and, 
handing out sweets, an image that should 
be familiar to most Americans. Palestinian 
students at al-Najah University in the city 
of Nablus marked the anniversary of the 
outbreak of Palestinian violence with an 
exhibition entitled The Sbarro Cafe 
Exhibition, celebrating this suicide bomb
ing. According to Associated Press reports, 
the exhibition was replete with body parts 
and pizza slices strewn across the room. 
The walls were painted red to represent 
spattered blood.
Terrorist organizations that deliberate
ly target civilians with the intent to maxWhile Condoleezza Rice states, You cant say 
there are good terrorists and there are bad ter
rorists, Colin Powell suggests that he made a 
mistake by agreeing to Israels demand....
gered by forces outside India. I mention 
here Pakistan, which is conducting train
ing camps.... I also met four captured mil
itants: one Afghan, one Palestinian, and 
two Pakistanis. They admitted that they 
fought in Afghanistan and Kashmir at the 
behest of Pakistan.
Now let us turn to President 
Musharrafs philosophical brothers in the 
freedom struggle, the Arab leaders. The 
US and Britain have for many years been 
concerned about Syrias support for 
armed militant groups including
Hizbullah and Hamas (freshly added to 
the list of terror organizations by the US), 
and the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (who recently assassinated 
Israels tourism minister). Bashar Assad,
imize pain and suffering should never be 
called freedom fighters. Our adminis
tration seems contradictory on the ques
tion of terrorism that does not explicitly 
target the US. While Condoleezza Rice 
states, you cant say there are good ter
rorists and there are bad terrorists, 
Colin Powell suggests that he made a 
mistake by agreeing to Israels demand 
that a week of Palestinian nonviolence 
precede the implementation of the 
Mitchell Committee recommendations. I 
suppose that a week of nonviolence is too 
much to ask from the freedom fighters 
of this world.

by: Sean Mintus
A few brief comments before I get started here. First, the rea
son I wasnt in last week was because my column got cut. I wont 
go into specifics. Second, many thanks to AB for entertaining 
me with the maniacal genius known as Henry Rollins. It was a 
thoroughly entertaining evening that I wont soon forget.
Last, but not least, is the ongoing issue with Dean Murphy. 
Thankfully, I finally had the opportunity to sit down with him 
and speak face-to-face. While I will not withdraw my criticisms 
of the shady goings-on of which he was a part, I will say that 
after talking to him, I was reassured that his best interests lay 
first and foremost with the well-being of his students. However, 
Im afraid that his intentions, although good, have recently not 
yielded the best results. Perhaps its unfair of me to criticize so 
harshly a man who has so much to deal with, but he knows full 
well that those in positions of power have their actions perpetu
ally put under a microscope by people like me. Nevertheless, 
while I might not agree with the man on several fronts, I have 
grown to respect him and believe that, hit or miss, hes doing 
what he can.
Down to brass tacks. An awful lot of people read what I write 
here every week. This isnt an ego trip ... at least not entirely. 
Whether because they see me as the lone source of truth in the 
publication, or like to take a few moments out of their Mondays 
to laugh, or because they simply want to see what the whirling 
vengeful cesspool I call a mind will come up with next, I believe 
I am, week in and week out, the most read portion of this paper.
Id be a fool not to love it. I take great pleasure in having peo
ple come up to me on campus and tell me how great my article 
was. On the flip side, I enjoy much more having someone tell 
me that I am a colossal raging jackass who needs to learn his 
place and shut his bong hole. Either way, cemented is the fact 
that what I write is both read on a large scale and one of the rea
sons why this papers readership has increased.
Ive been writing here for two years and change. Thats one 
column a week for four plus semesters. Taking into account 
breaks, holidays, and occasional expulsions due to the inflam
matory nature of what I write, that amounts to roughly sixty 
columns of approximately 1500 words each. That word count is, 
of course, of a pre-cooked nature, seeing as how my columns are 
sliced and diced week in and week out.
Thats 90,000 words. Hell, even Dickens wasnt that longwinded. 90,000 words that I could have put into an essay or a 
short story or a novel or a letter that instead I decided to com
mit to press because I believed that there were always people 
out there who wanted to read it. I still believe that there are, but 
the bellyaching I have to go through just to get something pub
lished has become too much.
This all stems from a conversation I had with Jimbo not long 
ago. The day that my criticism of Dean Murphy was put out, I 
came home to find Jimbo sitting in the dark, a cigarette in one 
hand and a mostly-drained bottle of whiskey in the other.
I read your column, he said as he polished off the bottle.
You poor fool. Dont you have anything else to waste your 
time on? I replied.
The bottle rocketed past my head and smashed against the 
wall behind me. Jimbo dove headfirst at my chest and we both 
toppled to the ground. This was not the first time that my room
mate had tried to kill me. He bears a scar on his midsection from 
the time he charged me with an eight inch bowie knife and I 
turned the pig sticker around on him. He tells everyone that the 
scar is from an appendicitis, but I know better. Ask him politely 
sometime and he might show it to you.
At any rate, I threw an elbow to his midsection and tossed him 
off me.
What are you doing? I screamed.
He clamored to his feet, lit another cigarette, and sat back 
down at his desk. I stood up and inched toward the door, unsure 
of what my insane alcoholic roommate would try to pull next.
What am I doing? You slandered the dean in his own paper! 
You might as well have put him over your knee, pulled his pants 
down, and spanked him in front of the entire Board of Trustees!
So? I replied indignantly.
You ignorant fool. You think hes going to let you get away 
with his? Hell have his hounds nipping at your heels for the 
rest of your natural born life. I hope you enjoy having to look 
over your shoulder at night.
Ye gods, youre right. That fiend could croak me anytime he 
wants to. But what do you care?
He took another drag of his cigarette and produced a new 
bottle of whiskey. He tossed it to me and I suckerpunched 
my liver.
I dont care. Hell, if he kills you, Ill have this place all to 
myself. But the high-end university types cant even tie their 
own shoes, let alone successfully have someone murdered. 
Theyre going to come after you and get me! Hell, youre never 
here and all I do is lay around and drink your booze. Whatever 
cross-eyed parolee they enlist to send you on your way is gonna 
stumble in here and put a tire iron upside the back of my skull, 
he wailed.

What a week this has been: I 
got a couple of good dates, 
Thanksgiving is coming up, and 
whoops, wrong column. But still, 
it has been a very exciting and 
interesting week. When I wrote 
my last article for this space, the 
Northern Alliance was preparing 
to move out onto Mazar-el-Sharif. 
Now the question is whether or 
not the stronghold of Khandahar 
will fall, and thus allow the 
Northern Alliance and the United 
States control of all the cities of 
any importance in Afghanistan. 
Japan and Germany are willing to 
send troops overseas. American 
consumers decided to binge on 
new cars and other things last 
month. Attorney General Ashcroft 
and the President are making a 
bid for near dictatorial powers. 
House Republicans finally real
ized that opposing federalization 
of airport security made them 
look worse than usual. A1 Gore 
really should be our President. 
What a week!
A combination of American air 
and logistical support, Northern 
Alliance aggressiveness, typical 
Afghan willingness to switch to 
the winning side, and Taliban 
strategy has allowed most of the 
major cities to fall into our pup
pets hands. Pashtun tribes in 
southern Afghanistan realize that 
the Taliban are the losers of this 
civil war and they have started to 
attack Taliban positions too. 
According to the last reports that I 
have seen, the Taliban has been 
reduced to half strength as it has 
dispersed to the southern hills,
where it hopes to wage a protract
ed guerrilla campaign.
The dissolution of a formal, stand
ing army will mark the end of the 
first phase of the campaign in 
Afghanistan. This phase was the fair
ly easy one, as it involved war on the 
industrial scale: dropping 8,000 
bombs, refueling thousands of air
craft from airborne tankers, firing 
million-dollar missiles. These are all 
activities that the United States has 
had half a century to practice. The 
United States is extremely good at 
destroying a standing army, especial
ly one that is not especially mobile. 
This was the easy phase, and there 
are many more phases to go until 
Afghanistan is pacified and the peo
ple are friendly.
This process will have many dif
ferent steps and Ill only speak 
about the first couple of steps. The 
first critical step is to stabilize the 
situation on the ground. Right 
now, it appears that the United 
States is doing a good job. 
American commandos and British 
Royal Marines have already land
ed at Kabul to secure the airport 
and prepare it for aid delivery. 
French and Turkish forces are 
preparing to move into other criti
cal airports to do the same thing. 
Aid, especially food, will be criti
cal this winter, as Afghanistan has 
suffered through twenty years of 
war and three years of severe 
drought. Food should not be used 
as a strategic weapon, it should be 
distributed as efficiently as possi
ble and as blind to faction as pos
sible. We should not use food to 
reinforce one side or another. The 
United States needs to establish a 
perception of fairness in order to 
match our rhetoric that we really 
are for human rights.
At the same time that we are 
delivering food, the cities need to be
secured from both Taliban guerrillas 
and Northern Alliance infighting. 
Peaceful existence is a wonderful 
selling tool for Western ideas. The 
United States probably should not 
be the most visible presence on the 
ground. Wisely, this administration 
has been talking to friendly Muslim 
nations in order for them to provide 
the yisible troops. Turkey, 
Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Nigeria 
are all nations that are predominate
ly Muslim and non-Arab who are 
internally stable, at least when com
pared to Indonesia or Pakistan. 
Using these national forces is a good 
idea for several reasons. First, it 
allows the United States to shift the 
burden to other nations for the most 
mundane tasks and secondly, it 
shows the average urban Afghan 
that the United States does not want 
to conquer Afghanistan.
So these two steps, in conjunc
tion with blockading mountain 
passes and the occasional hit-andrun raid by infantry into the caves 
and mountains where the Taliban 
and Al-Quaida are probably hid
ing should be the plan of action 
until the spring thaw. At this time, 
the United States then needs to do 
something that we are usually 
unwilling to do abroad, but are 
more than willing to do at home. 
We should provide the basic tools 
needed for reconstruction and 
then let the Afghan people do it 
themselves. The United States 
should provide both large scale 
credit for major infrastructure 
projects such as bridges and road
ways that we destroyed in our 
bombing campaign, and the 
United States should encourage 
micro-credit for the billions of 
small, almost inconsequential per
sonal projects that will improve 
the standard of living for the botSee ANDERSON, page A8

jjMVL&t&UM, kwlraLcLrush hour backups in the Squirrel Hill Tunnel by half.
Yikes! Can you imagine what traffic would be like if we 
did not build this thing? Well, the PTC certainly does not 
consider alternatives. In fact, there is a note at the 
bottom of all the traffic reduction figures stating that the 
figures are based on average daily traffic (ADT) projections 
between the no-build and build conditions in the year 
2030. I wonder if their projections, in the case of the no
build option, factored in $3 billion worth of investment in 
alternative transportation research and implementation 
between now and 2030?
Perhaps it is unfair to expect the Turnpike Commission to 
give any consideration to alternatives to highways. After 
all, they are called the Turnpike Commission (they say a 
carpenter thinks of every problem in terms of hammer and 
nails) and not the Transportation Commission.
I have not begun to tackle the issues of depressed 
economies and neighborhoods. Perhaps these issues have 
something to do the flight of population from the city. 
Since 1950, the population of Pittsburgh has dropped 50 
percent. This is a phenomenon that is not going to be 
helped at all by the construction of the MFE and may even 
be exacerbated. The expressway is only going to make it 
easier for individuals (I should say automobiles) living 
outside the city to commute into the city. The quote ani
mals dont soil their own dens comes to mind. Basically, 
since these commuters do not live here (and do not have 
any incentive to), they will not care about the quality of 
life here. We do live here and we do care.
Pittsburgh is not just a business district or giant mall. 
Laying out a multibillion dollar, 65-mile carpet straight into 
the heart of downtown is going to smother Pittsburgh resi
dents, in more ways than one, for the betterment of John 
and Jane Commuter. This is called auto-hegemony, where 
the automobile has more clout than the pedestrian or the 
resident. Pandering to this philosophy will result in a 
decrease in quality of life, tax base, environmental quality, 
and population; and an increase in air/noise pollution, traf
fic, antisocial behavior, and loss of community. In some 
instances, as in the case of Hazelwood, the MFE will physi
cally divide the community.
So, what are we supposed to do if the highway is not 
built? The problems that the PTC cites as reasons for the 
MFEs construction are there, but the PTC is not the only 
one looking for a solution (though they might have the 
most money with which to propose solutions). Students 
for a Better Pittsburgh is new to these issues, as am I, but 
we are looking for alternatives. What I hope to accom
plish in this article is a raising of awareness about this 
proposed highway and its legitimizing reasons, upon 
which I then cast realistic doubt. I encourage you to ques
tion this issue in your own way.
SAY WHAT?
third graders holding hands, indians and pilgrims celebrating new
found lands, tried to teach me that at school, make the white race 
look superior has always been their rule, now i can't believe we 
celebrate thanksgiving as our day of unity and praise, if i had my 
way, we'd all dress in black and daddy would serve up the white meat, 
cuz genocide is nothing to celebrate, extinction don't deserve a 
parade, well we perpetuate those lies with the turkeys that we buy. 
i tried to explain it to my mom but she's too afraid to admit to 
herself that her race is a killing machine, take a look around your 
town, take a look around your town, take a look around your town and 
who do you see? the native american surprisingly absent in his own 
indiginous land, want to know why it's cuz we killed them all. it's 
not so hard to understand, yeah so i go to college and you know what 
i learned? that 80 million people were killed by my grandpa your 
grandpa and all of their friends, they bleached out our continent but 
that's not the end. the last full blooded aborigine died a century 
ago. if it's possible there's a place in the southern hemisphere with 
a history even worse than our home, no one finds it peculiar that 
theres a tropical island that's full of people just like you and me. 
cuz australia's a piece of s*** floating in the pacific buoyed by the

Know what MFE means
MFE is the acronym for the Mon Fayette Expressway. The 
MFE is a proposed tollway that will, if built, stretch 65 miles 
from Morgantown, West Virginia up through Fayette County 
and the Mon River Valley, ultimately linking with interstate 
376 at Monroeville and Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania 
Turnpike Commission (PTC) is in charge of the project.
Why is this tollway being built? Indeed, if it is necessary 
to build a tollway costing over $3 billion (an estimated cost 
that has risen over $1 billion since 1993), it must be solving 
some intense problems.
Note: I will not be noting the sources for all my facts in the 
body of this article, but rest assured I do have them. You are 
encouraged to contact me at bir@andrew.cmu.e4u or my group,

the local roadway system in the southern and eastern por
tions of Allegheny County. It goes on to list the symptoms 
of the heavy traffic volume our local city streets: increased 
air and noise pollution, limited attraction of redevelopers, 
safety problems, etc. Therefore, the problems plaguing the 
region are depressed neighborhoods, a depressed economy, 
and lots of traffic.
I will first speak on the issue of traffic. The PTC has given 
us exciting projections of the traffic reductions throughout 
the county if the MFE is built. Some of these reductions will 
occur on Forbes Avenue (20 percent reduction), Fifth 
Avenue (5 percent), Boulevard of the Allies (5 percent), 
and Murray Avenue (10 percent); additionally, it would cut

nique. In addition to this, the media often devotes 
extensive focus to sex scandals and controversies, 
sometimes to undue extremes, simply because we 
eat this stuff up. In accordance with the free speech 
provisions of the First Amendment, however, the 
media provides an outlet for those who fret that 
America is becoming too sex-oriented. The result is 
a collective cognitive dissonance over what is 
appropriate regarding sex in America, which is 
something that we are often ridiculed for overseas.
As a case in point, I would like to refer the read
ers to the recent report on KDKA regarding the 
pornographic film shown on campus on 
November 11. The report was well done, taking 
input from both sides of the issue, and explicitly 
stating that ID checks would be performed and 
that no one was being forced to watch the film. 
However, it seems rather odd that they would 
devote an entire two minute slot to the report 
when there are much more important matters to 
discuss. Either it was a slow news day, or the exec
utives at KDKA looked at the ratings and said Oh 
shoot! We need something shocking to get people 
to look at our news coverage! While Id be willing 
to give them the benefit of the doubt by assuming 
that the former influenced their decision, Ill leave 
it as an exercise to the reader to come up with 
his/her own opinion.
This collective cognitive dissonance regarding 
sex is a serious problem, as we need to come up 
with a clear message regarding sex, if for no other 
reason than so that our progeny will not have to 
make the same mistakes we did. However, censor
ship, either of the sexual attraction or the revul
sion towards sex, flies in the face of the freedoms 
that this country was founded upon, as we would 
be no better than Afghanistan under the Taliban. 
Obviously, there is no clear solution that would 
work for everyone beyond general guidelines such 
as no one under a certain age allowed to access 
explicit sexual material. Therefore, it is up to each 
person to decide the proper solution to this prob
lem, which is as it should be if we are to respect the 
freedoms and responsibilities that were laid out by 
the founding fathers of this country.

Now that I have voiced my opinion on the postSeptember 11 political situation, I would like to 
take a break from politics to discuss something 
else that has been on my mind as of late. This 
week, I would like to talk about sex. In particular,
I will speak of American attitudes towards sex and 
how sex is depicted in the media, and I will con
clude with my comments on the report that aired 
on KDKA about the pornographic movie recently 
shown on the CMU campus.
Lets face it folks: Sex is an inescapable part of 
our biology. To deny it, as some would want us to 
do, is to deny ourselves. Our sexual drive is hard
wired into us by both genetics and environment. It 
is also critical to the survival of humanity as a 
species. After all, without sex, none of us would be 
here. Besides, if we were to go ahead and get rid of 
sex altogether in our lives, the only options avail
able to us for species continuance would be invitro fertilization and cloning. However, cloning 
leads to some rather sticky ethical issues, and even 
in-vitro fertilization raises some peoples moral 
hackles. Keeping sex around seems like the only 
sensible solution to this problem.
When it comes to American attitudes towardssex, however, we see a rather interesting neurosis 
develop. Sex in America is much like a bad train 
wreck  horrific to look at, yet strangely mesmer
izing. It is the strangely mesmerizing aspect of sex 
that leads the porn industry to be the lucrative 
behemoth that it has become. And yet it is the hor
rifying visage of sex that leads us to be disgusted 
by the sexual Olympics carried on by Congressman 
Condit, Senator Packwood, former President 
Clinton, and Justice Thomas.
The media in this country, moreover, both feeds 
off of this unusual cultural phenomenon, and exac
erbates it. We are often told that sex sells, and 
this is evident in a large portion of advertising. And 
then there is the apparently explosive popularity of 
magazines like Cosmopolitan and Redbook with 
entire articles devoted to proper sexual tech

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 19, 2001
Women dominate in tip-off tournament
Luis Cota/Photo Staff
Danyelle Sinclair led the team on Saturday night, picking up five rebounds.
TIPOFF, from page A10 
appeared to be plenty prepared for 
the championship game.
WOOSTER
The championship meeting on 
Saturday afternoon was a different 
story for the Tartans. The College 
of Wooster gave the Tartans a 
game, but the crown was eventual
ly handed to CMU by a score of 
69-60.
Forward Nara DeJesus and 
guard Michaelyn Brunner led the 
resistance by Wooster. DeJesus had 
a tournament high 16 rebounds 
and Brunner contributed 18 
points.
The first couple minutes were a 
little sluggish for the Tartans, but 
everything started clicking from 
that point on. With 17 minutes 
remaining in the first half, CMU 
went on a 15-0 run that would give 
them the cushion that they would 
retain for the remainder of the 
game.
At one point in the second half, 
the Tartans would eventually gain
a 20 point lead over Wooster, but 
the Fighting Scots would go on an 
11-0 run to bring the lead back to 
nine.
Things would continue back and 
forth, but for the most part, CMU 
was able to keep their comfortable 
nine point lead into the final sec
onds of the game.
Brady was at it again for the 
Tartans, this time racking up 25 
points and pulling down eight 
rebounds. Her unstoppable play 
made her an easy pick for tourna
ment MVP.
Also contributing 12 points 
apiece for the Tartans were Sain 
and Sodini. Sodini also added four 
assists and five steals as well. It 
should be interesting to see what 
the team can do with their experi
ence and poise.
We can use this tournament as 
the first step to a successful sea
son, said Sodini. The comfort 
level on the court is high right now. 
The year of experience under our 
belts is definitely working in our 
advantage.

turnovers.
This was something that we 
worked on all fall and over the 
preseason, said Wingen. He was 
clearly proud of his teams pres
sure and overall defensive effort.
However, in a 78-67 loss to 
Grove City College at Skibo 
Gymnasium, poor shooting 
doomed the Tartans. They again 
pressured the Wolverines into 
committing 20 turnovers, but the 
Tartans could not convert these 
turnovers into points in the transi
tion game. For the game, the 
Tartans were out-shot, 55.0 per
cent to 39.7 percent and outrebounded 43 to 28. Additionally, 
Grove City sunk 29 of 48 free 
throw attempts as they pulled 
away in the second half.
First-year student Jason Walters 
was named the West Penn 
Classics outstanding player in 
scoring 19 points against 
Washington and Jefferson and 22
points against Grove City College. 
From this performance, it is evi
dent that the Tartans could have a 
future star on their hands. Walters 
was the second Tartan to be 
named the West Penn Classic out
standing player; current assistant 
coach Kevin Byrne was the other, 
as he won the award in his junior 
and senior years of 1994 and 
1995, respectively. Senior Dom 
Ionadi was also named to the all
tournament team.
The Tartans next play in the 
Ramada Plaza Suites Carnegie 
Mellon Tournament this coming 
weekend, and Wingen is opti
mistic about the future.
I feel positive about there 
being a championship coming up 
next week, said Wingen.
With all their starters returning 
from last season, when they fin
ished 7-18, the Tartans have a 
chance to make a run for the 
league title this year in the 
extremely competitive University 
Athletic Association.

been racking up accolades since he 
began swimming at CMU. This 
week was no different for 
/McCarthy, who just last Tuesday 
!was named UAA Player of the 
! Week.
 I think [the award] was very 
well-deserved, said Belowich. 
Hes always working hard, always 
trying to improve. He wants to be a 
more complete swimmer.
In the 500 yard freestyle, 
McCarthy beat out the second place 
finisher, teammate Kevin Paavola, 
by a whopping 10 seconds. Of
course, he wasnt going to leave the 
meet without posting at least one 
new record  and McCarthy did 
just that, breaking both the school 
and pool records with his time in 
the individual medley (IM) relay.
The Tartans wont see any action 
until after Thanksgiving, but that 
doesnt mean they wont be train
ing just as hard.
Having been invited to a D-I meet 
at Miami University of Ohio on 
November 30, the team looks to 
face a tough challenge against 
some truly elite foes.
Its a championship type of 
meet, said Belowich.
While about half of the team will 
head to the Miami meet, the 
remainder will head to an invita
tional meet at Grove City, where 
they will face competition from 
within the UAA, as well as some DII teams.
However, both teams will spend 
plenty of time in the next couple of 
weeks training hard, then resting 
up in preparation for the meets. 
While the challenge level promises 
to be very high, recent history 
shows that these Tartan swimmers 
are more than ready to rise to the 
occasion.

heard nary an insult directed to

Teen struck while 
going to Bengals game
' CINCINNATI (AP)  One of six 
people struck by a vehicle in a 
downtown crosswalk on the way to 
the Cincinnati Bengals game with 
Tennessee died later Sunday.
Police said Scott Asbrock, 15, of 
Mason, died at University Hospital. 
. Asbrock and the other pedestri
ans who were struck were walking 
to Paul Brown Stadium. Police said 
the driver of an SUV ran a red light.
Darrin Stafford, 30, of 
Evansville, Indiana, was driving the 
SUV, said police spokesman 
Lieutenant Kurt Byrd. His license 
restricts him to use of a vehicle that 
lias hand controls, and the vehicle 
he was operating did not have 
them, Byrd said.
Stafford was charged With one 
count of aggravated vehicular 
homicide and three counts of 
aggravated vehicular assault, Byrd 
said.
Two people remained hospital
ized Sunday night. Stewart
Williams of Middletown was in crit
ical condition. Kyle Fields of 
Madeira, was in serious condition, 
Byrd said.
Fields brother, Kenneth, of 
Madeira, declined treatment. Jami 
Henderson of Middletown was 
treated and released. Officer Jon 
Harris of Cincinnati, who police 
said tried to pull pedestrians out of 
the way, was treated and released.
The owner of the SUV, Frederick 
Shipman of Evansville, Ind., was a 
passenger in the vehicle. Shipman 
was charged with one count of 
complicity to aggravated vehicular 
homicide and three counts of com
plicity to aggravated vehicular 
assault for allowing Stafford to 
drive the vehicle, Byrd said.
The accident happened at 11:42 
am, while thousands of fans were 
walking from downtown Cincinnati 
to the riverfront stadium. The acci
dent occurred just a block from the 
stadium.
Twins pitcher Radke 
wants to stay on team
MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Brad 
Radke wants to stay with the 
Minnesota Twins, and send a 
message that his team deserves 
to be saved.
The star pitcher informed the 
team Thursday that he was 
declining the opt-out clause in 
his contract.
Radke signed a four-year, $36 
million contract in July 2000 
that included the right to 
demand a trade after the 2001 
season. If Radke had exercised 
the option, the Twins would 
have had to trade him by 
February 15 or he would have 
become a free agent.
The Twins could be headed 
toward elimination as part of 
the owners contraction plan 
that also might eliminate the 
Montreal Expos.
Id like to see the Twins stay 
in Minnesota, and maybe this 
will help out a little, Radke
said. It wont hurt. I think it 
might have hurt if I had decided 
to get out.
Radke has three years remain
ing on the contract, and a no
trade clause will take effect for 
the final three years.
This is an indication in my 
mind that Brad wants to see this 
through, to see this organiza
tion succeed, Twins general 
manager Terry Ryan said. He 
likes living in this community 
during the season, he likes the 
people in this organization. 
There are a lot of positives in 
this.
Radke was 15-11 last season 
with a 3.94 ERA.
I just sat down and did some 
thinking and thought that we 
had a heck of a year last year, 
and I just want to be part of the 
future here, Radke said. We 
have a group of great players on 
this team.
Contrary to opinion, Jets Martin not underrated
MARTIN, from page A10
1997: Patriots play two playoff 
games; Martin injured and misses 
both.
1998: Jets play two playoff 
games; Martin runs 36 times for 
124 yards and two touchdowns in a 
victory against the Jaguars, runs 13 
times for 14 yards and one touch
down in a loss to the Broncos.
1999: Jets finish 8-8 and miss 
the playoffs.
2000: Jets finish 9-7 and miss 
the playoffs.
Basically, Martin has only played 
in five playoff games with a career 
record of 3-2. His playoff average 
of 81.0 yards per game is only 
lightly lower than his career aver
age of 85.9 yards per regular seaisbn game.
However, the first part of his 
career coincided with Terrell 
Daviss unprecedented postseason 
dominance, and the past few years 
have coincided with the brilliance 
of Marshall Faulk.
Martin simply has not stood out 
when he has needed to most. This 
is not an indictment of Martins 
l abilities, nor is it a supporting argu\ ment for Davis or Faulk being bet
ter running backs. But it is the 
tmth.
So, whats the bottom line? If 
Curtis Martin produces in the post
season this year, he will get his due.
Now, since Im a staffwriter who 
cant write letters to the editor, Ill 
respond to a non-sports editorial 
from last weeks issue:
I would like to comment on Akhil 
Wables article in the most recent 
issue of the Tartan, in which he 
eulogizes the death of rock music. I 
am of the opinion that if someone 
wants to continue in the rock tradi
tion of challenging the status quo, 
he should start first with himself.
Contemporary music may not 
have as powerful a message as clas
sic rock did in its glory days, how
ever that could easily be due to the 
fact that the message itself may 
hold less meaning today.
Lets face it, times change. 
Get [ting] high on your freedom, 
as Mr. Wable put it, has been a last
ing theme for decades, and perhaps 
people need something new to hold 
their attention.
Clearly, the rewards for spread
ing a message to a jaded audience 
do not measure up to those given to 
entertainers who sell out by pro
viding the public with what it 
craves.
However, to those who want to 
re-live the glory days of music, I 
would suggest that they contribute 
somehow. Get up there and sing 
rather than crying about days gone
by (at least sing about days gone 
by). If you have no musical ability, 
write songs for people who can.
If you have no writing ability, be 
a manager  find people with the 
talent you need and get the mes
sage out by organizing perfor
mances and by promoting them.
Above all, make it worth your 
while. If you really want rock to live 
on, and if you are truly disgusted 
and saddened by the entertain
ment we have in modern times, do 
something about it (beyond writing 
a critical editorial in a campus 
newspaper).
If, however, you feel that enter
tainment, like life, changes with 
the passing day, then carry on. 
With all due respect, thats what I 
plan to do.
Okay, back to football now. Its 
nice to see that the Doug Flutie-Rob 
Johnson so-called feud has died 
down. Clearly, Rob Johnson is a tal
ented passer who could be a star in 
this league for years to come if he 
ever gets an offensive line.
The Bills, in rebuilding mode, 
clearly made the right choice in 
picking a rising star (albeit one 
who cant stay healthy due to his 
tendency to fight for every yard) 
rather than a fading media darling 
who wouldnt get the Bills to the 
Super Bowl this season anyhow.
The Chargers also made the right 
call in picking a veteran who knows 
how to win close games for a team 
that severely needed that leader
ship.
However, its clear that without 
an outstanding set of receivers that 
he had in Buffalo, Flutie magic is 
the stuff of smoke and mirrors.
Now if only people would stop 
hounding QB guru Mike Holmgrem 
in Seattle by telling him Dilfer 
deserves to play.
Citing his winning streak as 
proof that Dilfer is a bona fide 
winner (let alone the fact that he 
was truly pathetic in the playoffs; 
the Ravens defense did everything 
in the playoffs last year), were 
hearing that Holmgrem is crazy for 
trying to groom a future star in 
Matt Hasselbeck.
How dare an offensive genius 
train the most important part of his 
offense for the future? He could be 
winning with Trent Dilfer! What 
a bunch of bull. Coaches know 
their players better than anyone in 
the media, and its hard to under
stand beat writers questioning 
Mike Holmgrem of all people. But 
what place does reason have in the 
mainstream media?
RJ Sikdar is just happy to be get
ting out of this place this weekend.
When Penn State honored a for
mer football player at halftime, the 
University didnt launch fireworks 
and streamers. At Pitt, the event is 
usually celebrated with a parade, a 
street naming, and a Blue Angel 
flyover. Youd think the player was 
a modern Alexander the Great.
Last season, Pitt not only 
embarassed themselves, but also 
several former athletes with the 
honoring of the 1980 10-1 squad. 
Pitt arranged for the Pitt offense to 
reenact the winning touchdown 
from the Sugar Bowl game against 
Georgia.
Out onto the turf trotted six outof-shape middle-aged men and 
Dan Marino. It reminded me of 
running a play in on the play
ground with several fat buddies of 
mine. The only difference was 
they were better dressed. 
Nonetheless, the crowd sizes were 
about the same and the defenses 
were just as formidable.
Dont expect Paterno to grow a 
mullet just yet, however. The only 
thing that changes with D-I As alltime winningest and most noble 
coach is the tint in his eyeglasses. 
Behold the might of symbolism of 
college football incarnate.

deficit at Rochester to win, 30-20. 
The following week, they hosted 
Grove City and continued the magic 
by winning 17-14 because of a 
touchdown on the last play of the 
game.
In the season finale, it looked as 
though the Tartans would finish the 
season with one last magic trick, 
taking the lead at Rhodes College 
with less than a minute to go. 
However, the Rhodes Lynx returned 
the ensuing kickoff to steal the 
game back and win, 35-32.
You have to admire the team for 
its guts, determination, and perse
verance through that stretch, said 
Lackner of the comebacks. They 
were sparked by good chemistry 
and great senior leadership that 
drove a desire never to give in, and 
their passion showed off in the 
results.
We were disappointed with the 
7-2 record, because we felt that 
after every game we were the more 
talented squad, added junior line
backer Frank Adam. However, 
something even greater happened 
throughout the season. With each 
game, the team bonded closer and 
closer together, and despite missing 
the postseason, I am finally proud 
to be a Carnegie Mellon Tartan. I 
am proud not because of our good 
record or stats, but because we had 
what only great teams have: heart. 
This year was the start of a new tra
dition.
The exciting thing is, added 
Lackner, that while we had a great 
core of seniors, it was a small core. 
That means well be returning the 
majority of our players, and with 
off-season work we can become 
stronger and faster.
The Rhodes loss might leave just 
enough of a sour taste in the play
ers mouths to encourage to work 
hard in the off-season, and we 
should be competing for the divi
sion title next year. I just hope 
everybody looks at all the good 
things we did this year, and that 
they dont just dwell on the final 
loss.

Jets' Martin 
better than 
believed
120 Yards
by RJ ikdar
This past week, we have seen the 
midseason evaluations of many 
columnists, and its clear that there 
is overriding sentiment in the 
media that promotes a disturbing 
notion  that Curtis Martin is 
underrated.
It seems that we hear this every 
single year. But is he really under
rated? He has won the following 
midseason awards and comments 
from columnists:
Chris Mortensen, ESPN: 
Offensive player, MVP honorable 
mention 
Mark Cannizzaro, ESPN: Most 
Valuable Player 
John Clayton, ESPN: AFC All-Pro 
RB
Pete Prisco, Sportsline.com: MVP 
candidate, a picture of consisten
cy
David Moore, FoxSports.com: 
Worth MVP candidate, arguably 
the best back 
MSNBC NFL Notebook: Offensive 
player honorable mention 
Paul Zimmerman, Sports 
illustrated: 2nd RB (behind Jerome 
Bettis)
Don Banks, Sports Illustrated: 
Best AFC player we still dont 
appreciate enough
So, clearly, Martin is getting 
some publicity, especially consider
ing hes on a team that, despite a 
6-3 record, has only outscored its 
opponents by two total points in its 
first nine games.
So what is the real issue sur
rounding Curtis Martin and this 
supposed lack of recognition? We 
always hear how hes a great, hum
ble player who does not sell him
self. That is part of it. However, 
there has to be some on-field issue 
that is contributing to this.
Despite being an incredibly reli
able, consistent, and productive 
back for the past seven years, Curtis 
Martin simply has not had many 
truly spectacular postseason per
formances. Some numbers:
1995: Patriots finish 6-10 and 
miss the playoffs.
1996: Patriots play three playoffs 
games including Super Bowl; 
Martin runs 38 times for 225 yards 
and 4 touchdowns in victories over 
Pittsburgh and Jacksonville, runs
11 times for 42 yards and one 
touchdown in a loss to the Packers.

the Tartans cleaned up the tourna
ment, beating both Chatham and 
Wooster.
CHATHAM
The 2001-2002 season for the 
Tartans certainly ignited with a
bang on Friday night. Their 96-18 
victory over Chatham College was 
quite the pounding, to say the 
least.
Six players scored at least eight 
points for the Tartans as they 
cruised through the entire game. 
The game was never really in dan
ger, especially when CMU jumped 
to a 10-2 lead in the first four min
utes.
This weekend was a team 
effort, said junior point guard 
Michelle Sodini. We didnt rely on 
one player to get the job done. We 
complemented each others 
strengths very well.
Especially brilliant for the 
Tartans was the play of junior cen
ter Erin Brady. Brady pulled in 
nine rebounds and had 21 points 
for the game. Sophomore forward 
Carissa Sain was close behind with 
nine rebounds and 20 points. Sain 
was also 4 of 8 from three-point 
land.
Other double-digit scorers for 
the Tartans were Sodini and junior 
guard Danielle Bennett, with 13 
and 10 points, respectively. Sodini 
was on the border of a double
double with her nine assists.
Even though Chatham didnt 
show much on their side of the 
ball, CMU still seemed very com
posed and together out on the 
court. Everything was clicking for 
the offense, which can be attrib
uted to their 96 points. They

Football team positive 
after strong campaign
by Tristan Hoffmann
Junior Staffwriter
Despite a disappointing finish, 
the 2001 season of Tartan football 
was one to remember. The team 
went 7-2 and had four consecutive 
comebacks to end the season, win
ning all but their last attempt. If 
you wanted to give us a nickname 
this season, said head coach Rich 
Lackner, it would be the Comeback 
Kids. Or the Cardiac Kids.
After winning their first four 
games handily while outscoring 
their opponents 147-49, they faced 
their biggest challenge of the year, 
eventual UAA champion 
Washington University, on 
Homecoming. Despite a very strong 
game by the Tartans, Wash. U. 
pulled off a 17-7 victory to give the 
Tartans their first loss.
The Tartans then found them
selves at a turning point in their sea
son, playing another conference 
game at the University of Chicago. 
How would the Tartans respond 
after their first loss? They respond
ed with a last second comeback vic
tory, in which they tied things up 
with no time left, and then won it 
all in the second overtime session in 
miraculous fashion, 23-17. This 
comeback set the tone for the rest of 
the season.
The Chicago game sticks out in 
my mind for importance, said 
Lackner. It was our first comeback 
win and it was also a conference 
win. We went 3-1 in the confer
ence, and I dont think anyone 
picked us to do anything in the con
ference.
The Tartans followed the perfor
mance by erasing a 20-3 halftime

Pitts football progra 
pales next to Penn Stata
Yinzer Yak
by Brad :rantz
Albeit one of the least humor
ous characters on a local rock sta
tions morning show, Tino 
Martino, host of Mullet Talk, 
may have said it best when he said 
what separated the mullet from a 
disgruntled female caller who 
criticized his show: Class,
b**ch.
The more I watch the football 
programs at Penn State and Pitt, I 
realize that Tinos insightful 
observation could also apply in a 
comparison of the Nittany Lions 
and Panthers. After attending this 
weekends Penn State, Indiana 
duel, never more has Pitt stood for 
Pitt-iful and Penn State for class.
In 2000, Pitt captured a 12-0 
victory in the last meeting sched
uled for the in-state rivals for the 
next decade. The great sports 
pontificator began to surmise that 
Pitt had surpassed the almighty 
Penn State in play, recruiting, and 
most absurdly, coaching, after the 
Panthers bowling season.
Penn States abysmal com
mencement of 2001 then gave the 
talk-show junkies enough materi
al to call for Coach Joe Paternos 
retirement. The insults began to 
roll off the tongue of the press 
with the ease of a US invasion of 
Afghanistan. Stop the malarkey.
Paterno proved once again why 
hes in a class whose ranks tally 
one when his troops rallied to go 
4-1 in their next five games. All 
the while, Pitt was attempting to 
escape its own quagmire of team 
dysfunction.
Its a shame that Paterno had to 
silence his critics by turning 
around this season. A man who 
has declined to run up the score 
against any opponent, always 
stuck with his upperclassmen in 
times of defeat, and donated mil
lions to his employer, should not 
have to prove himself. However, 
he illustrated why he is still the 
best leader in all of college foot
ball. Paterno is not only con
cerned with his teams on-field 
performance, but off the field as 
well. In 1998, Paterno suspended 
his teams star running back for 
accepting a suit from an agent, 
before the Lions match with the 
Florida Gators in the Citrus Bowl.
At Pitt, such ingenuity would 
probably earn you a new locker to 
keep your dapper outfit clean.
Granted, the Panthers have 
defeated Big Least adversaries 
Rutgers, Temple, and Virginia 
Tech en route to the same 4-5 
record that Penn State holds. 
Antonio Bryants sideline tirades 
have magically faded to the back
ground. His antics, praised by 
head coach Walt Harris as indica
tive of his passion, undoubtedly 
could not be given the same elo
quent defense by some of his 
teammates.
To the unobservant, it appears 
that both squads have overcome 
their fair share of hardships to 
recapture the endearment of their 
fans. However, it takes only a 
slight affinity for cynicism to J 
underscore why Penn States foot-/ 
ball operations are head andi 
shoulders above the University 0 f ,

Swimmers use balanced 
attack at Case dual meet
by Balaji arpeshkar
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon swim teams 
headed to Case Western Reserve 
University this past Saturday for a 
dual meet with their UAA rivals, 
their last meet before the 
Thanksgiving holiday. As always, 
the only question for the mens 
team was not whether they would 
come out on top, but how wide the 
margin of victory would be. While 
the squad didnt dominate in every 
race, the couple they couldnt put 
away arent likely to keep them 
awake anytime soon.
On the womens side, the compe
tition was just as close as the score 
would indicate, as Case narrowly 
edged the Tartans, 154-145. 
However, like the mens squad, the 
women turned in several strong 
individual performances, with a 
CMU swimmer finishing in at least 
fourth place in every race.
However, quite possibly the most 
impressive performance for the 
women was the effort of senior 
diver Ashley Cesarano, who took 
the board on Saturday despite being 
injured.
We dont give out awards after 
each meet, but if we did, Ashley 
would get the Courage Award, said 
head coach David Belowich.
Cesaranos inspiring performance 
went a long way toward helping the 
womens diving team dominate 
their Case counterparts, with 
Cesarano, junior Rose Seyler, and 
first-year standout Mindi Finnegan 
locking up the top three spots in 
both the one meter and three meter
dive.
Of course, the womens trio of 
captains, seniors Erin Andrew, 
Alexandra Schmidt, and Sara 
Schultzer, certainly did nothing to 
damage the teams chances at com
peting. Andrew and Schultzer, for 
example, finished an extremely 
close second in the 50 yard freestyle 
and 50 yard backstroke, respective
lyWe just came a little short with 
the women, said Belowich. 
Everybody on the team still did a 
great job, though.
On the mens side, the biggest dif
ference between this weeks outing 
and previous meets this season is 
that all the races were not won by 
the usual suspects. Rather, the 
results of the meet were much more 
balanced this time around, and can 
be attributed to a slightly altered 
lineup.
I put together a lineup that was a 
little different from what we usually 
do, said Belowich. I wanted to 
give some of the other guys a 
chance to win for once.
And win they did, dropping only 
the 100 yard breaststroke by a nar
row two hundredths of a second. 
One of the more notable showings 
was turned in by sophomore Brian 
Jucha, who won both of his races, 
the 50 yard freestyle and the 50 
yard fly. It certainly did not hurt 
Juchas cause, of course, to be close
ly followed by a teammate in each 
race.

over the past season has been a

Campus galleries exhibit eclectic range of student work
by Benham Farahpour
Photo Co-Ed tor
The end of the semester 
marks the time when cre
ative people leave their 
dark caves to present their 
work. In the past two 
weeks,there have been 
quite a few shows at various 
galleries across campus.
It all started with the CFA 
Hewlett Gallerys November 
7 to 11 exhibition of 
Groundwork, a joint exhibit 
of work by first year archi
tects and design students: 
With the addition of all new 
studio and drawing class 
professors, the first year 
foundation programs in the 
Schools of Architecture and 
Design have been curved
more artsy rather than the traditional strict design 
ideals. One of the exhibited projects for design students 
entailed choosing a few words describing them and to 
design a hat out of construction paper and 
glue portraying those words. They then 
made a poster representing their hats. On 
display, representing a taste of first-year 
Architecture work, were 3-D renditions of 
plant studies describing the way in which 
plants grow out of their pots. From observa
tional sketches, students created wooden 
models portraying the plant form. The 
exhibit was a nice collaboration of the 
Architecture and Design Schools, displaying 
how both programs compare and contrast in 
the expression of ideas.

Clockwise from top: Students discussing 
study abroad experiences at the UC Gallery,

Frame, visitors at Groundwork.
There will be a very interesting installation at the 
Hewlett Gallery from November 18 to 20 by Lauren 
Darby and Ellen Johnston titled Mapping the Terrain: 
Theory and Practice in Environmental 
Thinking and Art.
Darby explains her installation as, 
Water is a necessity of life. Beyond its 
physical ability to hydrate and cleanse, 
water provides mental, emotional, and 
spiritual refuge to all living creatures. The 
sights and sounds of running water are 
associated with balance and serenity. For 
these reasons, life has flourished near 
water. But as values and priorities have 
shifted, has this appreciation diminished? 
Another recent group show titled 
Vicarious 01 was at the UC Gallery from 
November 12 through 16. For years it has 
been customary for students to come 
back to Pittsburgh and show photogra
phy, scrap books, and paintings of their 
experiences. This past Friday, a closing 
reception was held when students had a 
chance to talk with other students about
their experiences abroad.
Currently on exhibit is Title-Fight at The Frame 
Gallery, with works by Abigail Satinsky and Gretchen 
Winterkorn. On display is a 
myriad of mediums, rang
ing from photography to 
large oil paintings and 
video installations. The 
black and white photogra
phy self-portraits by 
Gretchen fearlessly exposes 
herself to the outside world 
in an intriguing manner. 
Glancing over at another 
wall, one could not help but 
be struck by large colorful 
oil paintings demanding 
attention and understand
ing of their titles including 
Lets Fu*k Like Rabbits

On a mild November morning in South 
Bend, Indiana, Carnegie Mellon alumnus 
Greggory Brandt prepares his son Eddie for 
another day of school, just like any other par
ent would do for his eight-year old son.
Eddie eats a breakfast of Reeses Peanut 
Butter Puffs, just like any other kid would, and 
awaits a school day loaded with work. Im 
learning a lot of stuff in school right now, he 
says, heavily emphasizing a lot.
But unlike most fathers and sons, by 8 pm 
tonight, the Brandts will be onstage at South 
Bends Morris Performing Arts Center, 
embroiled in an epic story of love, devotion, 
scandal, war, and honor. They will dodge bul
lets, climb barricades, wander scummy streets, 
scream and cry  but most of all, they will

George 
Carlin 
fills local 
audience 
with 
laughter
Political satirist George Carlin knows 
how to fill the theater with hysteria.
by aina Durai
Staffwriter
George Carlin without the 
political satire is like strawberry 
shortcake without the strawber
ries. Of course, the lack of polit
ical satire was not his fault. 
Carlin explained before his 
November 10 performance that 
for the sake of survival, he must 
cooperate with the government. 
Heinz Hall was packed, which 
shows how much Carlin stands to 
lose if he continued expressing 
his anti-American sentiments 
and anti-government jokes. Its 
too bad, really. He opened with 
a commentary about the parts of
the body we pick off: toenails, 
scabs, dead skin. Bemusing and 
entertaining, if not quite humor
ous. Apparently, I am not the 
only person that bends toenail 
clippings because their flexibili
ty just amazes me. He continued 
on with a long tirade about the 
people of this world that need to 
die. And according to Carlin, 
they dont just need to die they 
need to have their skulls sliced 
open with an aX and so on. These 
people include white guys that 
shave their heads and people 
that wear visors. It is said that 
Carlin tries to offend every single 
person in the audience at one 
point or another. That Saturday 
night he fell short, but he was 
still vitriolic as ever. Its a good 
thing he wasnt giving this talk in 
Texas.

Rollins: Passive, funny, demanding, controversial
by msha =athak
Staffwriter
CMU received a big dose of 
Henry Rollins during his spoken 
word performance to a very broad 
audience in McConomy Auditorium 
on last Monday night.
Rollins began performing spoken 
word in the days of Black Flag, the 
famed 1980s punk band that 
emerged in Los Angeles in the wake 
of the classic rock era. Black Flag 
was notorious for heavy rock, 
rough shows, high turnover of band 
musicians (with the exception of 
founder Greg Ginn), and fans who 
would jump on stage and lend 
vocals to the music when there was 
no lead singer. Henry Rollins, who 
came to know Black Flag with 
friend Ian MacKaye (now of 
Fugazi) in 1981, was invited to 
become the lead singer after a suc
cessful turn at the microphone. It 
was during his time with the band 
that Rollins began writing and giv
ing spoken word performances as 
part of shows.
In 1986, founder Greg Ginn 
decided to part with Black Flag, 
which led to the bands breakup. 
Rollins, not ready to leave the rock 
scene, started the Henry Rollins
band within a year of the breakup 
and resumed touring and recording 
albums. Rollins also started his 
publishing company, 2.13.61, 
which has released his own works 
as well as those of Exene Cervenka, 
female lead vocalist of the LA punk 
band X, and Iggy Pop.
In last Mondays performance, 
as is typical of his spoken word 
shows, Rollins stepped away from 
the aggressive, confrontational 
sides of his character and shared 
his opinions on various ailments of 
society and his propositions for 
their remedy. From the beginning 
he was very honest and immodest, 
both in speaking and in stage 
demeanor. During his introduc
tion at the start of the show, 
Rollins warned that he usually 
salivated quite a bit from the 
speaking in his performances; not 
far into the show there were large 
spit spots on the torso of his shirt. 
Rollins spoke on topics ranging 
from Canada, to driving in 
Washington, DC, to Japanese 
Samurai. He discussed his busy 
traveling schedule, advising the 
audience to get out and travel as 
much as possible, or in Rollinsspeak, to bust a classic geograph
ic. Rollins also spoke about the

Amlie: French love story

Bursting onto the screen with 
the speed of a Surge commercial, 
Jean-Pierre Jeunets new film 
Amlie presents a beautiful and 
often irresistible postcard of not 
just France, but a highly concen
trated distillation of seemingly 
every cultural archetype of 
Frenchness.
Amlie, the latest from the 
director who made cult successes 
Delicatessen and City of Lost 
Children with Marc Caro, has 
already conquered France with 
near unanimous praise from both 
audiences and critics, making $40 
million domestically, an unheard 
of figure for a French film.
The movies plot is nothing less 
ordinary than a love story. The 
films uniqueness is in the wildly 
expressionistic manner it tells the
story, a sort of magic realism that 
not only seeks out the poetry in 
the every day, but explodes it like 
a firecracker into the screen. At 
one moment in the film, Amelies 
pounding heart bursts out of her 
chest; in another scene, she melts 
into a puddle of water on the 
floor. Like Run, Lola Run, Jeunet 
combines a dizzying tempo with 
an attention to the vicariousness 
of fate.
The story unfolds in a constant 
series of asides and digressions 
with a large group of characters 
not so much developed as refer
enced as types. They are a 
menagerie of quirky everyday 
French caricatures mostly 
reducible to a profession and a 
trait: the condescending grocer, 
the reclusive painter, etc.
In a frenetic opening 
sequence,the first two and a half 
decades of Amelies life are sumsee AMELIE, page B3

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 19, 2001
Courtesy of Bill Miller/Pittsburgh Broadway SeriesCourtesy of Joan Marcus/Pittsburgh Broadway Serigs
Greggory Brandt and his son Eddie Brandt (left) appear together in Les Misrables, the legendary musical presented by Cameron Mackintosh, based on Victor Hugos classic novel and the winner of eight 1987 Tony Awards, including 
Best Musical.
- ? . * N ,CMU alumnus tours with Les Misrables :
DRAMA, from B1
with the show. The father expresses their 
good fortune: They cant let him get too 
big, he says. But its been over six months 
now, and hes grown only about half an 
inch, so I think were fine for now. You 
know its a unique arrangement when a 
dad is happy about his sons lack of growth. 
: After the South Bend shows, the tour is 
making its way to Pittsburgh starting 
November 20, and running until December
2. For Greggory Brandt, an Altoona native 
and a graduate of Carnegie Mellons 
College of Fine Arts, the trip here will be a 
fiomecoming of sorts.
Its pretty neat, my parents are coming, 
he says. It should be pretty fun.
But he will also be making another sort 
of reunion. He hasnt been back to 
Carnegie Mellon since around 1992, by his 
estimate, and has already planned on 
returning to campus during his tour stop in 
Pittsburgh.
CFA is all pretty much 
different now in terms of 
the theater, he says in ref
erence to the addition on 
campus of the Purnell 
Center. ... Im definitely 
going to come back and see 
the voice students and 
stuff.
It will be a good stop for 
the Brandts, who have 
been touring with the show 
since late May, when 
Greggory accepted an offer to go on tour, 
and left the Broadway cast that he had 
been a part of since 1996. Since starting, 
the tour has taken father and son to Texas, 
California, even Vancouver  we drive 
everywhere, says dad  and in the 
months to come, it will cover locations 
such as Pittsburgh, Chicago, Charleston, 
Birmingham, Salt Lake City, Fort Worth, 
and Seattle.
Because of the 
demanding sched
ule, Eddie rarely 
gets to see his moth
er and his four-yearold little sister back 
in New York, and 
there-is a full-time 
tutor on the road to 
help school him and 
the other kids in the 
company. With his 
on-tour tutor, Eddie 
is basically on a learn-by-fax program with 
his public school back at home  a home 
which has been pretty distant for the past 
half year. The only visit home for Greggory 
Brandt and his son since hitting the road in 
May was over Halloween. It was nice to 
see the dog, Greggory jokes.
The two do have a piece of home with 
them on the road, and thats each other. 
They love sharing the stage, and Greggory
Brandt says they will continue to do so 
until their run on the tour ends, probably in 
May, when the company moves on to Asia.
We spend a lot of good quality time 
together, he says.
Eddie has the same feelings, saying that 
its really neat to go on stage with him 
sometimes. Without completely finishing 
his sentence, he corrects himself, adding, 
... or a lot of times.
The Brandts have a hectic life, but its 
good to them, and they are happy with 
what theyve got.
I love doing the show, says Eddie. I 
get to see all the places in the country, its 
just really nice. I love this tour, I gotta stay 
here as long as I can.
The same goes for his father, who has 
been with the show for over five years.
Im a swing in the show, and it lets me 
not get bored, he says. I cover twelve dif
ferent people. Its been really nice. I cant 
believe its been that long already.
Greggory Brandt remembers college life 
at Carnegie Mellon quite clearly, and goes 
out of his way in emphasizing the impoptance his education had in forming his 
career.
I probably dont think Id be where I am 
if it werent for CMU, says Greggory 
Brandt. Being in a city like Pittsburgh 
helped me grow and do other things when
I got out of school because of the theater 
opportunities, and the opera opportune 
ties. ' 10
He has already decided that he wants to 
eventually return to Pittsburgh and teach, 
to give back what he was given. In retro
spect, he says, college was better than he 
knew, and thats why I want to come baek 
and teach. 1 *
At this moment in time, there is very lit
tle time to sit back and relax, and the 
Brandt Boys dont seem to mind. Its pret
ty fun, says dad. Were taking it all -in 
strides.
CMU receives big 
dose of Rollins
ROLLINS, from page B1 
pains of domestication and how 
'.men and women manipulate each 
other. The audience discovered 
how truly funny Henry Rollins 
could be when he lightened his 
voice to the falsetto range and imi
tated womens voices, both when 
they are passive and cute and 
aggressive and demanding. In a 
particular story, arguably one of 
the funniest in the show, Rollins 
recounted the trials a couple goes 
through when they move in 
together and must decide how to 
decorate their living space. 
According to Rollins, there is a big 
problem if the woman wants cur
tains and the guy does not. Rollins 
concluded that the woman would 
soon convince her man to put up 
curtains, because she would 
threaten (Rollins screaming in a 
female voice): If you wanna DO 
me, you DO curtains!
In addition to the entertaining 
anecdotes, stories, and social com
mentary, Rollins advised students 
on a number of issues. He encour
aged the students to read profuse
ly, wear professors out with ques
tions, and, of course, to listen to 
music, particularly, as he stressed
about six times throughout the 
show, the Ramones. In recounting 
the more poignant events of his 
life, Rollins unabashedly shared 
his mistakes and misjudgements, 
seeming to sincerely hope that 
others who find themselves in 
analogous situations would 
emerge in better form than he did.
Alhough Rollins gave an 
unquestionably entertaining per
formance, his writing has more of 
an impact than his spoken word 
performance did. The content 
found in his books and poetry is 
much more profound, and it 
seems that he is steadier and 
more coherent on paper. Rollins 
is quite engaging on stage but 
loses touch with his train of 
thought, which can be effective 
but sometimes distracting to 
watch. Mondays performance 
lasted slightly too long  per
haps this was because he forgot 
where he was going sometimes, 
or perhaps because he had so 
much to share. For a better dose 
of Henry Rollins, check out his 
books or the newsletters from 
2.13.61, which Rollins writes to 
his fans while he is on tour, or 
take a look at Rollins Band lyrics.
Pittsburgh down on 
the floor laughing
CARLIN, from page B1
Carlin attempted to make up 
for the lack of political satire 
with anti-religion humor. He 
explained how he could shorten 
the Ten Commandments into 
one or two. The skit was as 
humorous as it was intelligent. 
He slipped in various opinions 
such as religious leaders and 
fanatics being the people to care 
the least about the Thou shalt 
not kill commandment, 
because more people have died 
in the name of religion than for 
any other cause. He commented 
on the fact that people kill oth
ers because they pray to a differ
ent invisible man in the sky. 
Carlin showed no hesitation in 
using the events of September
11 to buttress his point, which 
was a nice and poignant 
moment.
Carlin also tested a few oneliners on the audience, and 
actually used most of them 
again on Lettermans November 
17 show. He promoted his 
November 12 HBO special, 
explaining that he may use 
some of the same sketches there 
too. Continuing, he expressed
his general disgust with the 
human race, joking about how 
earthlings never get radio 
waves from extraterrestrials 
because human beings commit 
so many atrocities against each 
other. He tried to be PC, he real
ly tried. But in the end, hes still 
George Carlin. One has to won
der what topic Carlin will 
choose to attack next. He can
not be faulted for his shameless 
self-promotion. No matter what 
he says, the guy is still funny. 
Hes more entertaining than 
any part of Wean. Heck, hes 
even more fun than fingering 
random users to read their plan 
file. In fact, he could go up on 
stage and talk about staplers 
and still be funny. Really. Hes 
just that good. He even appeals 
to people who suffer from the 
very prevalent disease of humor 
impairment disorder. He 
laughs at himself as well. Just 
remember, if you get sick of the 
comedian, when George arrives 
carlin, dont answer the door. 
Especially if hes carrying boxes 
of Girl Scout Cookies. Or toe 
nail clippings.

75 years ago, November 12, 
1926  The University Tuitions 
committee approved the largest 
tuition increase to date. Tuition for 
the 1927-1928 academic year will 
be $300 for the academic year, up 
from the current $200 for current 
students. The board explained that 
they needed to increase it as they 
havent changed the tuition in over 
five years and would like to 
.improve facilities, faculty salaries, 
and student life.
! 50 years ago, November 20, 
1951  50 students signed a peti
tion to disband the Student 
Council. It was to be tabled for one 
week and voted on at the next
meeting. Students were concerned 
with the powers that the Council 
had listed in their constitution. 
They felt that the Council was not 
acting in their powers, or they were 
simply an intermediary used by the 
administration to disseminate 
information.
25 years ago, November 16, 
1976  The University explored 
new plans to improve the lighting 
on campus. Spurred by observa
tions and student complaints that 
portions of the campus were inade
quately lit, Michael Corletti, 
Director of Security, decided that a 
renovation of lighting was neces
sary. Areas of high pedestrian use
would be top priority over the com
ing weeks.
This semester, the Nerd News, a 
publication by five freshmen has 
caused lots of commotion on cam
pus. Students arrived at the idea 
while trying to find a way to pub
lish good grades and study habits. 
Each week, they spotlight a Nerd of 
the Week (NOW), and describe 
their academic achievements. They 
planned to seek recognition from 
Student Senate as a student organi
zation to help with funding issues.
10 years ago, November 18, 
1991  During last weeks Student 
Senate elections, a strong write-in 
campaign resulted in ROTC mem
bers filling 10 of the 17 open seats. 
Entire voting turnout was around 8 
percent of the student body. Some 
Senators were concerned that the 
newly elected ROTC members 
would not reflect their decisions for 
the entire campus community.
Tartan football team pounded 
the Case Western Reserve 
University team with an impressive 
score of 43 - 0. They finished with 
a 9 and 1 record for the season, but 
it was not enough to guarantee a 
spot in the top four in the division.
5 years ago, November 18, 
1996  Robert Meeropol, son of 
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spoke 
on campus last week. His parents
were executed on the electric chair 
for conspiring to steal the secret of 
the atomic bomb when Meeropol 
was six years old. He spoke about 
the death penalty, his parents, and 
the controversial case of Mumia 
Abu-Jamal. He explained that his 
parents were wrongfully executed 
and that Abu-Jamal is the first 
political prisoner in this country 
since the Rosenbergs.
1 year ago, November 20,2000
 About thirty students from 
Carnegie Mellon University and the 
University of Pittsburgh participat
ed in protests against the voting 
irregularities during the recent 
national presidential election
results. Many different groups were 
represented and there was not one 
specific message expressed by the 
group.
Demand for DSL services for off-} 
campus residents results in a shorti 
age for students. The University 
ran out of static internet protocol

Computing services moved to 
dynamically allocate the addresses 
as to alleviate the shortage.

__________________________________________________________________________THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 19, 2001________________________________________________________________________________B3,Amlie: the quintessential French film
AMELIE, from page B1 
marized with an elliptical narra
tion straight from Truffauts 
Jules and Jim and at the same 
time, equally quick set pieces 
that recall the opening montage 
from Rushmore, complete with 
the films symmetrical composi
tion.
Amlie, it seems, is the lonely 
misfit with a heart of gold. This is 
of course, despite her gorgeous 
beauty reminiscent of Audrey 
Hepburn, a wardrobe that would 
put all but the most stylish 
Parisians to shame, and a hair
style that was the rage of England 
months before the film opened 
there.
Presenting Amlie as 
Grandmother of the Lonely,
Madonna of the Unloved, is one of 
the largest conceits of the film.
The death of Lady Di serves as 
the catalyst for the main thrust of 
the story, in a typically indirect 
fashion that sends her off on a 
series of missions to make others 
happy: first returning a box of 
keepsakes, anonymously, to a man 
who hadnt seen them since he 
was a child; hooking up the bitter 
regular and the hypochondriac 
cashier at the caf where she 
works, and helping the mistreated 
grocers assistant.
In a chance encounter, she falls 
in love in a chance encounter with 
a boy who keeps an album of dis
carded portraits from instant 
photo booths in Pariss Metro sta
tions. Her aggressive but nonconfrontational pursuit of him is 
the centerpiece of the movie, as 
she sets up elaborate games to 
lure him to a meeting she doesnt 
have the nerve to consummate, 
giving us a tour of the landmarks 
of Paris in the process.
The intoxicating perfection 
with which the photography, cam
era movement, music, sound and 
special effects, and editing com
bine and interact is the greatest 
pleasure of the film. The rhythm 
that Jeunet synthesizes is breathtakingly graceful; its virtuosity is 
obvious evidence that he is a nat
ural filmmaker. In the end 
though, Amlie is surprisingly dis
appointing.
Unlike in Truffauts films, 
where his attention to the minuti
ae of the ordinary results in a 
powerful poignancy, in Amlie the 
gestures begin to seem trite and 
insincere, ultimately not adding 
up to anything beyond a layer of 
superficiality. With Jeunets heavy 
borrowing of New Wave style and 
his frequent references to early 
Truffaut, the movie seems to be a 
retread of the familiar, like the 
hermetic painter in the film who 
spends his entire life indoors, 
painting copies of Renoirs.
More disturbing that its superfi
ciality is an implicit but undeni
able reactionary tendency first 
pointed out by critics from the 
Paris weekly Les Inrockuptibles, 
several of the only dissenters 
among the French critical commu
nity. Jeunet has said that he tried
to take control of every frame like 
a painting. We cleared the streets 
of all cars, cleaned the graffiti off 
the walls, andreplaced posters 
with more colorful ones. In addi
tion to this however, Jeunet 
almost completely painted away 
minorities form modern day Paris, 
a glaring contradiction to reality.
The lone exception to the films 
staggering whiteness of the 
speaking characters is the grocers 
assistant who is portrayed in the 
clich of the good-hearted mild 
mentally disabled. He is helpless 
to defend himself against the cru
elty of his employer and is saved 
by the fabulous benevolence of 
the films heroine.
The only other exception to this 
whitewashed vision of Paris is a
single long shot with three black 
teenagers in the background. 
Even worse, two television clips 
featuring African Americans are 
shown in a way that treats their 
subjects as amusing curiosities. In 
one a black woman leads a gospel 
group with an electric guitar. In 
the other, a peg-legged man 
dances and sings the blues, com
plete with harmonica.
Jeunets curious exclusion of a 
huge chunk of modern day Paris 
takes on an even more upsetting 
dimension when considered in 
relation to the way the film so: 
fiercely and incessantly hocks 
nostalgia. When one connects the 
two streams, a disturbing message 
is implied that strongly sours the 
films sugary breeziness.

Data Storage Systems Center, Seagate Technology 
receive grant for research in magnetic recording
by riram Vaidhyanathan
Science and Technology Editor
Hard disk drive technology has progressed in 
leaps and bounds over the past few years, espe
cially with the advent of the Internet in house
holds all around the world. One can pick up disk 
drives capable of storing gigabytes of informa
tion for under $100. And for the past decade, the 
amount of data that can be magnetically stored 
within a square inch of disk has more than dou
bled annually, a fact that is as amazing as it is 
taken for granted. Recently, however, the Data 
Storage Systems Center, at Carnegie Mellons 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, has. been 
awarded a grant to pursue research that could 
lead to making disk drives smaller and capable 
of storing much more information.
It is strongly believed in the field that the 
spectacular growth rates in hard disk drive capa
bilities over the last few years, much like the 
famous Moores Law, cannot be sustained with
out inventing new approaches to data storage. 
Research into new methods of storage suggest 
that heat-assisted magnetic recording could be 
the answer.
The grant, provided by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology, amounts to 
almost $21 million over the next five years.
 The research might enable densities of record
ing to approach one terabit per square inch of 
surface area on the disk, meaning that almost 
six hours of media could be possibly captured 
onto an area on the disk equivalent to that of a 
thumbnail.
Heat-assisted magnetic recording is expected 
to be able to bypass the physical limitations of 
the current recording limit. This new process 
uses a laser to heat a small spot on the disk 
where data is to be written. Heating the spot will 
lower the magnetic field needed to write to that 
spot. This process will allow for very high-density materials, but without the high magnetic 
fields usually needed to write data. The partner 
organizations in the five-year, $20+ million pro
ject will develop the materials, processes, and 
devices that will allow the data storage industry 
to commercially produce new systems that are 
both technically advanced and affordable. 
Consumer electronics, telecommunications, and 
imaging systems are some of the sectors that will 
benefit from the technology developed.
Today, hard disk drives are essential compo
nents of personal computers, digital VCRs, and 
many digital cameras. As the density of data on 
a hard disk grows, the size of the disks them
selves can shrink. IBM already is selling a 
Microdisk that can store a gigabyte of informa
tion on a device measuring not much more than 
an inch square. Hard disk drives could be built 
into cars, hand-held audio devices and any num
ber of machines and appliances.
Robert M. White, University professor of elec
trical and computer engineering and director of 
the Data Storage Systems Center, founded in
1983, said the project seeks to develop dramatic 
increases in data storage performance, capacity 
and reliability.
The need for increased storage has been 
pushed to the limit by continued expansion of 
computer networks, the proliferation of the 
Internet into every business function and home 
use, the extension into the entertainment indus
try and the emergence of new data storage con
sumer products.
White believed that the requirement for new 
technology in the field was of paramount impor
tance in the increasingly electronic world.
The major problem with advancement in the 
existing storage technology is that densities are 
fast approaching a physical limit to the amount 
of information that can be magnetically encod
ed onto a given surface area of disk. The phe
nomenon, known as superparamagnetism, is 
caused by the fact that the data bits will become 
so small that they may become thermally unsta
ble. However, todays magnetic recording heads 
are unable to write to media that would solve 
the problem.
New disk media materials will be investigated 
to increase energy density, and, to cope with the
resulting rise in magnetic field requirements, 
the field required for recording data will be 
reduced using a novel approach known as ther
mally assisted or hybrid recording. In this 
approach, optical energy provides a small, pre
cise spot of heat at the disk during the writing of 
data, reducing the required field to a level 
achievable by the recording head. The extreme 
density regime (one trillion bits per square inch) 
initially targeted for validation of the technology 
will require new and unproven methods for 
designing and creating the head. Novel optical 
and magnetic components and engineering 
modeling tools will be developed, along with 
new materials for the head-disk interface to 
cope with severe heating and cooling cycles. An 
overall challenge will be to design solutions that 
are both technically sophisticated and afford
able.
The five year grant from the NIST is to form a 
partnership between the Data Storage Systems 
Center, the National Storage Industry 
Consortium, the Advanced Research 
Corporation, MEMS Optical, Inc., Seagate 
Technology, and the University of Arizona. The 
projects final aim is to produce materials, com
ponents and processes of manufacture that can 
continue to push the densities of magnetic 
recording disk drives.
The grant is part of the NIST Advanced 
Technology Program (ATP). The ATP tries to 
bridge the gap between the research lab and the 
market place, stimulating prosperity through 
innovation. Through partnerships with the pri
vate sector, ATPs early stage investment is accel
erating the development of innovative technolo
gies that promise significant commercial payoffs 
and widespread benefits for the nation. The 
ATP aims to change the way industry approach
es R&D, providing a mechanism for industry to 
extend its technological reach.
The Data Storage Systems Center at Carnegie 
Mellon University is an NSF Engineering 
Research center, and aimed towards the 
advancement of magnetic and optical recording 
for the storage industry.
Vital communications, critical infrastructure systems under threat from cyber-terrorism
by =ratik mgarwal
Staffwriter
The threat of terrorist attacks against US 
interests and around the world has become the 
countrys most pressing national security issue. 
After the horrific incidents that took place on 
September 11, which was followed by biological 
terror in the form of anthrax, people were left 
dazzled as to what step the terrorists could take 
next. The United States is preparing and imple
menting a fierce retaliation to these terrorists, 
by bombing their military bases to weaken their/ 
capabilities. This will certainly prove to be effec
tive while combating weapons and items of mass 
destruction. However, there still lies one threat
- a threat so simple, yet deadly, that it can cause 
incredible damage without almost any expense
- cyber-terrorism.
, According to Jeffrey Hunker, former director 
of Critical Infrastructure for the National 
Security Council, and the current dean of the H. 
J6hn Heinz III School of Public Policy and 
Management, Cyber-terrorism is relatively easy 
to do. It doesnt require a great deal of technical 
sophistication, many systems have very little 
protection, and it doesnt require vast, expanded 
availability of materials and equipment - just a 
few people who are fairly skilled can do a lot of
damage. For example, one can imagine the 
panic and problems that could be caused if all 
911 systems were to fail and the electricity sup
ply was taken away during an event such as a 
bomb explosion.
Hence, the prospects are very frightening. 
Attacks in recent times have targeted vital com
munications and critical infrastructure systems. 
Several of these systems are commercially 
important, as is evidenced by the fact that a cou
ple of hours of disconnection from the net
work costs certain companies millions of dollars 
in business. In the weeks to come, cyber attacks 
will evolve further, exposing vulnerabilities not 
yet identified by experts. The recent Code Red 
and Nimda viruses are good examples that 
revealed vulnerabilities in Microsofts Internet 
Information Server software. In fact, we have 
already begun witnessing the first signs of ter
rorist activities over the Internet!
Proof of terrorist links to the Internet can be 
traced in several of the worlds ongoing prob
lems. For example, if we take the war in 
Kashmir, militants in India and Pakistan have 
resorted to using cyber-tactics to disrupt each 
others information systems and disseminate 
propaganda. The number of pro-Pakistan 
defacements of Indian Web sites has risen 
markedly over the past three years. From 45 in
1999, it has reached 275 in 2001. All such cases
have been political, clearly visible, or involved in 
information dissemination. Similarly in the 
Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the Palestinians 
have been attacking in a similar manner, which 
has been dubbed as cyber jihad. According to 
participating groups: Part 1 was targeted to 
Israeli government sites, Part 2 on Israeli eco
nomic services, Part 3 hitting communication 
infrastructure, and Part 4 for a further escala
tion, including foreign targets.
Burgeoning numbers for identity theft could 
also be linked to this same worries surrounding 
cyber-terrorism.
Hence, we can see that cyber attacks are gen
erally expected during some military conflict 
and that their frequency and sophistication is 
also increasing quite significantly. Well, were 
never going to have control over it. What we can 
do in the short-term is substantially enhance our 
capability to protect ourselves against disrup
tions, said Hunker.
So, in the world of computers, we can only try 
and be prepared to face the worst rather than go 
out there and try to blow up the root cause. All 
we can hope for is that this amazing, yet myste
rious, world of the Internet, which has already 
managed to change the*lives of millions, retains 
its purpose as a world with no boundaries, no 
restrictions, and a place we view almost as a par
allel universe to our own real world.

CIT interdisciplinary 
courses offer different 
flavor for tech majors
by Mayank Bubna
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon University has 
had a long tradition of working on 
practical problems affecting soci
ety and the economy. In recent 
years, it has emerged as a leader in 
producing a whole new genera
tion of researchers to carry on the 
process of discovery and develop
ment. Furthermore, CMU has also 
developed collaborative partner
ships with various industries. 
These partnerships, along with 
the research activities encouraged 
by professors among the students, 
are part of CMUs innovative sys
tem in a loosely coupled alliance 
of industry, universities, and stu
dent research that develops new 
knowledge and technology and 
educates a highly skilled work 
force to apply this technology. 
This system, in turn, churns out a 
continuous stream of new prod
ucts and services to advance the 
economy, and improve the quality 
of life.
Carnegie Mellons interactions 
with industry bring real world 
technology and management 
issues into its research labs and 
teaching. It keeps the faculty and 
students current, grounded, and 
forward-looking. This alliance 
with industry continues to be a 
priority for the university, as can 
be noticed from its culmination of 
a relatively new course, the 
Engineering Design Project 
Course (39-605 and 39-606), an 
interdisciplinary team-based 
product design course which 
encourages the participation of 
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents from all colleges. All aspects 
of a design course are taken into 
consideration, ranging from cus
tomer need and product function 
to appearance and impact on soci
ety. These projects are directly 
suggested and funded by local 
industry or government agencies. 
The aim of the project is to give 
students hands-on experience 
with design and manufacturing in 
the real world. Some of the pro
jects in development are:
Cutler-Hammer is sponsoring a 
project to design a remotely oper
ated motorized device that 
mounts on an industrial-size cir
cuit breaker. This design requires 
trade-offs among size, cost, relia
bility, manufacturability, and 
speed of operation.
DuPont continues to work with 
students to develop an environ
mentally challenging product that 
will help clean up oil spills. Factors 
taken into consideration are envi
ronmental impact, and how tcu. 
make the product' available fcSd 
rapid deployment.
Several projects are new, aiflE^ 
are on the way towards develojJiZI 
ment. For example, Bombardi^ 
will sponsor a project in Which sttfT 
dents will first work with Adtranz 
engineers to select a project, likely 
associated with the design of their 
guide ways for their people 
movers (like those at the 
Pittsburgh International Airport).
Air Products is sponsoring stu
dents to design a miniature hydro
gen production unit (smaller than 
a breadbox). Such a unit, coupled 
with a fuel cell, becomes a serious 
contender for the portable pro
duction of electricity. The design 
of the features of such a unit is as 
important as the technology 
inside.
Future CIT interdisciplinary 
courses are sure to pique studnet 
interest. The department contin
ues to develop, and with sufficient 
interest and enough students in 
the course, they are willing to 
organize exploratory! project 
based on student choice.
Cornell University research in computer graphics 
could eventually lead to electronic eye technology
Behnam Farahpour/Photo Co-Editor
 As part of the Material Science and Engineering seminar series, Dr.
Darrel Untereker from Medtronics, Inc., gave a lecture entitled 
 Biomaterials: where we have been and where we are going.
(U-WIRE) ITHACA, NY - Computer graphics 
simulations at Cornell University may lead to 
improved vision for people affected by low 
vision disorders such as glaucoma, cataracts, 
and macular degeneration.
Thanks to a three-year, $450,000 grant from 
the National Science Foundations information 
technology research program, Dr. James 
Ferwerda is creating computer models to simu
late the way people with low vision see the 
world.
Using the models, Ferwerda, a psychologist 
and a research associate in the computer graph
ics program, plans to create assistive technolo
gies, such as Web browser enhancements that 
will help people read and small hand-held 
devices that will process images of the real world 
into a format that will allow people to move 
around more easily.
The most challenging part for me will be that 
we do it right, that the models we make will 
reflect the actual problems people have, 
Ferwerda said.
To make sure that happens, Ferwerda will col
laborate with Gordon Legge, the distinguished 
McKnight University professor of psychology at 
University of Minnesota and director of the 
Minnesota Laboratory for Low-Vision Research, 
who will test the models and simulations on 
human volunteers.
We will see if there is a correlation of the way
people with normal vision navigate the world 
[under simulated low-vision] to the way people 
with actual low vision navigate the world, 
Legge said.
The project is also supported by the Cornell 
program of computer graphics, founded and 
directed by Donald Greenberg, the Jacob Gould 
Schurman professor of computer graphics.
Low vision, which is defined by Ferwerda as 
vision that cant be corrected to normal, affects 
about 10 million people in the United States. 
According to Ferwerda, low vision disorders 
such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular 
degeneration produce very specific deficits.
With glaucoma, a person loses peripheral 
vision, which leads to tunnel vision. Cataracts 
cause a general loss of contrast and macular 
degeneration results in the loss of detail in the 
central part of the visual field.
Many psychology textbooks include illustra
tions showing how people with low vision see 
the world. However, most of the conventional 
drawings and descriptions of low vision are fair
ly inaccurate, Legge said.
For example, people with macular degenera
tion dont see dark spots in their visual fields. 
Instead, the brain fills in the missing visual 
information and the person sees a poorly 
detailed image.
Similarly, people with glaucoma dont see 
dark areas in their peripheral vision but instead
have trouble orienting themselves in their sur
roundings.
Therefore, to create accurate models, 
Ferwerda will use data taken from clinical stud
ies of people with low vision. Using those mod
els, it should be possible to process images to 
compensate for the exact defects suffered by a 
person.
The models will be general enough to be tai
lored to individuals, Ferwerda said.
Although assistive technologies for low vision 
sufferers currently exist, most of them are mag
nifiers, telescopes, or other optical devices that 
rely on prisms to shift an image to a different 
part of a persons retina.
Ferwerdas idea is to create hand-held devices 
that rely on microdisplays, which allow high def
inition images to be displayed on very small 
screens.
A person would look into the device and see a 
scene that is modified in some way. It could be 
shifted so it projects onto a different part of the 
retina, is displayed in higher contrast or even has 
an outline of the scene added onto the image. In 
addition, each device could be personalized, just 
like prescription lenses are distributed today. 
The technology could also be used in Web 
browsers to allow low vision users to more easi
ly view Web content.
I think it has great potential for useful appli
cations, Legge said.

Cap City Diner features 
upscale mushroomsCritic: The Strokes' music is rock without sibstance
by ara Royce
Junior Staffwriter
Taking a much-needed break 
from campus food and campus life, a 
friend and I decided to treat our
selves to a Sunday dinner at the 
Waterfront. Which of the many 
newly opened dining establishments 
should we choose? My friend sug
gested the Cap City Diner, her broth
ers favorite. Cap City is a modern
ized locale owned by Cameron 
Mitchell who also runs Mitchells 
Fish Market across the street. Even 
at 7 pm on a Sunday evening, we 
found the upscale diner packed, not 
a free spot in the valet parking lot. 
After a pleasant fifteen minute wait 
in the lobby, we were seated in a 
cozy booth next to the bar.
As we waited for our waitress, 
(one of the many times to come 
that evening) we commented on 
the decor. The diner looked like a 
regular 50s diner that had been 
warped into the 21st century. 
Complimented by an enormous 
gumball machine in the lobby, sure 
to please any small child (if it had
nt been out of order). The smoking 
section surrounded the bar and was 
located in a completely separate 
room so that non-smokers and fam
ilies can enjoy a quiet, smoke-free 
meal if they wish.
About a half hour later, our wait
ress came with the menus and a 
broken thumb. She apologized for 
the injured and bleeding, now 
heavily wrapped, digit, and asked 
us for our orders. Clearly, a wait
ress who handles food should be 
sent home for such a serious injury. 
Though appalled by the swollen 
thumb, we decided to try the 
steamed mussels for an appetizer. 
They were served quite promptly 
and were delectable. The mussels 
were covered in a seasoned butter 
sauce that was. so tasty that we 
wanted to dip our bread in it and 
enjoy every last bite. But where 
was the bread? It seemed that 
everyone else had a nice basket of 
rolls but us. We tried in vain to flag 
down our waitress, but she seemed 
to ignore us. Apparently she dou
bled as a barmaid and was far too 
busy making cosmopolitans for all 
the thirty-something single women
at the bar.
An hour later, our food arrived. 
My friend had ordered the meatloaf 
dinner for an expensive $11. She 
was most shocked to receive a 
pound of meat with precariously 
stacked mashed potatoes and onion 
strips on top. After dismounting the 
side of potato, she tasted her meal. 
They were good, she commented, 
but not better than a traditional 
diner where she could have 
received the same meal for far less. 
The mashed potatoes were not up 
to par with the home-cooked kind 
that a mom and pop diner would be 
sure to serve. My $10 Tuscan 
chicken salad came in an enormous 
bowl. There must have been a 
whole head of lettuce with piles of 
penne pasta on top. What made 
this salad upscale? The same 
ingredient featured in almost all 
Cap Citys meals: mushrooms.
After waiting another hour for 
our waitress to reappear again, we 
decided there was no time to order 
dessert. However, we noticed sev
eral desserts being served to other 
customers. The favorite seemed to 
be the Seriously Big Chocolate 
Cake, twice the height and width of 
a normal slice and enough to feed 
two. The other desserts looked 
equally appetizing, the hot fudge 
turtle sundae, crme brulee, carrot 
cake, and others.
Overall, the Cap City Diner just 
missed achieving its goal: provid
ing customers with a more appetiz
ing and higher quality version of 
typical American diner cuisine. For 
a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, we 
were disappointed. The service 
was atrocious, especially since the 
restaurant was only moderately 
busy. I can only imagine how 
neglected the movie crowd cus
tomers must be on a Friday or 
Saturday night. The food proved to 
be only slightly better than at my 
favorite diner, and was definitely 
overpriced. A novel idea, yes, but to 
beat out the competition this diner 
needs to start making their mashed 
potatoes from scratch and hiring a 
larger wait staff.

Expectations were high last 
Thursday as Pittsburghs shaggi
est haircuts converged on Nicks 
Fat City to see the seemingly 
uncontested new saviors of rock. 
For the past few months, rock 
journalisms complete surrender 
to these five Upper-East-side-yuppies-turned-East-Village-stylejunkies has been alarming to say 
the least.
I would be lying if I said I was 
never hypnotized by the'Strokes. I 
will admit to a generous amount 
of air-guitaring with periodic 
stage-diving off my bed on initial 
listen to the groups debut album 
Is This It  an album distilling the 
most palatable aspects of 
Television and late Velvet 
Underground filtered through 
modern-rock sensibilities.
However, repeat listening strips 
away the Strokes detached cool 
facade revealing the mighty Oz to 
be just a juvenile band of imita
tors. The songs were better the 
first time around on the VUs 
Loaded.
The Strokes set on Thursday 
clocked in at roughly forty minutes
where they played the entirety of 
their album along with the importonly track New York City Cops as 
well as a new song Meet Me in the 
Bathroom. All the while, the band 
maintained their badboy personas 
abstaining from on-stage banter in 
favor of indulging in smoking ciga
rettes and kicking beer bottles 
across the stage  it would be an 
oversight to not acknowledge the 
fact that they are good at what 
they do. But the inevitable back
lash that I see accumulating is 
attributed to the fact that the band, 
like the music, is essentially just a 
posture.
From an analytical perspec
tive, the show was a prime 
opportunity to observe, first 
hand, the effects of blinding 
superstardom on such a young 
band (with the members ages 
ranging from 21 to 23). At the 
heart of Thursdays Concert was 
a band artistically lobotomized 
by deafening critical adulation. 
Visibly there were moments 
where the band appeared strain
ing to maintain their appearance 
as fiery punk rock hopefuls. But 
while I was troubled by Julian 
Casablancas over-the-top justdont-give-a-sh*t demeanor and 
puppy-dog eyes, my housemates
The Strokes performed a forty minute set at Nick's Fat CityFhursday night.
The Strokes took the stage and impressed the crowd with such favorites as 
New York City Cop and new songs like Meet Me in the Bathroom. .
and the rest of the audience 
swooned with glee. There is no 
denying the sex appeal the 
Strokes command  a boyband 
for the underground perhaps. 
Dozens of squealing resale-clad 
short-jet-black-haired girls ful
filled this promise while render
ing my forehead slapping inaudi
ble. The songs are indeed catchy 
as all hell but digging below the 
surface would be a fruitless 
undertaking.
What is most perplexing about 
the Strokes is their mass appeal. 
The age-old rhetoric of there 
being better bands rings true 
once again. Underground resent
ment is rooted in the fact that 
they are not groundbreaking, 
they are not unique; basically, 
theyre just not punk. As punks
new ambassadors to the main
stream, the Stroke seem to be 
taking the Green Day route to 
crossover success, "heir greatest 
fault, and what willultimately be 
the bands downfallis their devo
tion to style over sostance, imi
tation over innovatim.
So as to not be nistaken, the 
Strokes put on an entertaining 
rock show: strictly Dy the book 
replete with head naking, micstand breaking, and m remarkable 
on-stage accurmlation of 
womens undergarmnts. But the 
Strokes are not savios of rock as 
the mass media ha led us to 
believe. They are at most guilty 
listening pleasures (In looking at 
you, Destinys Chile): hollow, 
inconsequential  ablip on the 
rock music radar.
Yum Wok serves up distinct and affordable cuisine Roadrunner Records
by mlex Meseguer
Copy Staff
When I first entered the relatively small, cor
ner located establishment known as Yum Wok, I 
wasnt expecting much. Much to my surprise, I 
would end up leaving with my stomach full and 
my palate sated. Yum Wok (their full name is Lu 
Lus Noodle Shop/Yum Wok Pan Asian Diner) is 
situated at 400 South Craig Street, right down 
Forbes and make the first right. Upon entering, 
I spied the tile floor and seemingly incomplete 
construction of the interior. However, these 
eyesores were counterbalanced by slickly paint
ed walls with highlighted photographs of large 
bowls of steaming noodles.
I opened the menu to find a broad selection of 
rice and bowl noodles, as well as authentic Asian 
soups and appetizers. I have one particular friend 
who orders gyoza every time we eat there. 
Anyone who frequents Yum Wok should make it a 
point to order something different every time. 
Some recommended dishes are the pho soup and 
Dr. Fus special. Also, if you want to experience 
the never-ending bowl of noodles, order the 
Singapore rice noodles. Three of us all took good 
sized portions of that dish after the person who

Junior Staffwriter
Motet entered The Morewood 
Underground with an impressive arrange
ment of percussive instruments. The guitar 
and bass were placed silently beside the 
stage. AB Tech awaited an experience 
unparalleled in the cosmos of virtual musi
cianship. The technical experts voiced their 
fears of an unsuccessful show as the micro
phone stood upright and ready for an influx 
of sound waves that would pulsate through 
the air and into the minds of the audience. 
The audience waited and waited, ate and 
ate. They spoke of scary movies and clapped 
their hands to the rhythmic beats of The 
Underground pool tables clankings.
The only thing that could be mustered is 
yet another diligent and sturdy case of tech
nical supplies to weave together Motets 
sweetly flowing arrangements.
The drum set stood waiting to be pounded 
and the audience waited for a beautiful 
musical experience to carry them far away 
from campus into a technicolor dream 
world. Tech stood astute to the technical 
importance of executing yet another perfect 
musical performance in The Underground. 
The pounding of the drums, strumming of 
the bass, and sizzling of fries and other 
treats combined chaotically in the room. 
Who knew that the world was such a zany 
place? More and more equipment enters 
the vicinity as the band boys prepared to 
launch missiles of musical perfection into 
an abyss of fine-tuned pop fanatic ears. 
Everyone waited in silence. Perhaps the 
clanking of equipment was their form of 
communication. But still, I had the feeling 
See MOTET, page B7
Ah yes, Roadrunner Records. I 
remember when that label on 
your CD meant that there were 
some seriously angry 
motherfuckers waiting to tear you 
a new one as soon as you popped 
the disc in the tray. Bands like 
Sepultura, Brujera, and Machine 
Head are some of the leading 
lights of this genre that pushed 
the envelope of heavy music. 
However, depending on your pref
erence of metallic hues, things 
have changed at this New York 
label that could. First off, there 
was the monster success of 
Slipknot, that brought them main
stream attention. And well 
deserved, too. Slipknot is one of 
the few bands out there that 
scared parents and commercial 
radio alike.
However, the overall vibe at this 
label is different. There is a new 
crop of bands that are all slicked 
up for radio, like Nickleback, that 
I just dont get. And others that 
insist on keyboards and moonyswoony singers that in my un
informed opinion are just not
heavy. But hey, the/rf sooooooo 
cute!
So, you can imagine what I: 
thinking when I heac out to seie 
the incomparable, invincible 
Slayer thanks to the lind folks at 
Roadrunner (who after this might 
not want to send m anywhesre 
anymore. Hey, just ki<ding, guys! 
Really!) to check ou the latest 
addition to their stabl:, Chimaira 
(pronounced kim-ear-uh). Thee 
guys have been calledrnu-metai 
and have a sampler/.eyboardist 
in the band. Oh well, a: least they 
might turn out to be rice guys in 
person. So, here we goj press play: 
First track: Let Go.
What is' this? A little
bass intro 
begins, 
sounds like 
callous on 
with the 
as anything
doublethen the anger 
foi this band 
an 80-year-old 
guitars squeal 
and melody 
found in the New 
Wave of Swedish Death. I must say 
Im intrigued. Hmmm, lets see 
what we get on the next track. 
Yup, there they\are. Keyboards, 
the bane of my Existence. Dead 
Inside sounds like old-school 
Fear Factory with hardcore vocals. 
Nice. The drummer seems to click

perfectly with eveyone else. Okay, Severed is up 
next. Again, an RF. type intro with a hardcore throat.
I have to say that Im starting to dig this, and that the 
combination of spaced-out samples with piercing 
vocals and machine-gun drums is something new for 
me. Chimaira seem to stand apart from their brethren 
in this nu-world order.
Pass Out Of Existence, the title track, is a toss-up 
for me. A pretty song in the interludes, it combines 
light and shade like most of whats fashionable right 
now. But it does so well and sincerely. Sp Lit is 
another example of this juxtaposition of anger and 
eerie harmonies. In fact, I found myself singing along 
in the gym listening to this one: Every time I trust 
you, I lose in the enddddddd! Rizzo and Forced 
Life are other standouts. Options has deliciously 
chunky bass lines and guitars. The real masterpiece, 
though, is the closer. Jade melds pure power into 
sonic landscapes, taking us on one last trip as we exit 
the collective mind of this twelve-legged beast.
Overall, the album is worthy of any metal fans 
attention. I think the musicians of this band are more 
than capable in channelling the aggression of their 
lead singer and working in sync with it. More than 
anything, what comes across is that they are fans of
metal, and they seek to advance it into this new age. 
Named after the three-headed monster of ancient 
Greek mythology, Chimaira is a deadly weapon in the 
war against mediocre music.

As far as service goes, some 
improvement could be sought. 
Despite their efforts to build a rep

quick food delivery, Ive spent 
many a minute waiting for my 
dish. Time and time again, I have 
found the waiting to be worth the 
trouble. When you know you the 
food is good and youre really real

in you to persevere.
Beside the wide assortment of
rise and noodle plates/bowls, they 
offer up the usual fare of soft 
drinks, as well as root beer, Asian 
style iced tea and pear juice. All 
are worth your time. As far as 
prices are concerned, it should be 
of little concern. I found every
thing on the menu to be very 
affordable for dining out once a 
week. A mere $5 to $6 will get 
you almost anything on the menu. 
My friends and I make it a point to 
visit at least once a week and try a 
different selection each time.
Overall, the atmosphere is light 
and inviting, one that encourages 
open conversation and light-hearted candor. It feels more like your 
dining room than a restaurant in 
the middle of Oakland. Chances 
are youll also find some of your fel
low CMU students dining at Yum

dining location. If authentic Asian 
cuisine is your style, then head on 
over to Yum Wok for affordable,

Madonnas childhood 
home auctioned
ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich. (AP)  The 
Material Girls childhood home went to the 
highest bidder in just 12 minutes.
Sam Michael, representing an Ohio real 
estate group, bought Madonnas former 
Oakland County home and a few items of rock 
memorabilia with a bid of $331,000 Saturday 
afternoon.
I had no idea this was going to happen, 
Michael told The Detroit News for a Sunday 
story. It was very exhilarating.
Michael said he hopes to profit by reselling 
the 1.3-acre wooded property.
About 15 people walked through the fourbedroom house and 10 registered to bid by 
posting $25,000 deposits. The auction drew 
online participants from as far as Nevada and 
Florida  some of whom wanted to turn the 
home into a shrine. Others, carrying cameras 
instead of checkbooks, simply came to see 
where Madonna spent her teen years. Posters, 
pictures and an encyclopedia on Madonna 
were arranged on an outside table. Some of 
her hits played over a loudspeaker.
The singer lived at the residence with her 
father, stepmother and seven siblings from the 
age of 12 until she left for the University of 
Michigan. Her father and stepmother stayed 
there until July, when the house was sold for
$270,000.
Saturday marked the second try at selling 
the home after an Internet auction on the Web 
site eBay attracted pranksters who bid as high 
as $99 million.
Beatles interview sells 
in auction
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP)  A sixminute recording of a Beatles interview - 
bought for $5 at a flea market  sold for 
$10,400 at an online auction.
A US man identified only as an avid record 
and music memorabilia collector since the 
1970s had the winning bid, Dave Gioia, 
spokesman for Collectors Universe of Newport 
Beach, said Thursday.
This particular item is by far the rarest item 
I have ever been lucky enough to purchase, 
the winner said in a Thursday email to the 
company. I am lucky, to say the least.
The three-week auction that ended 
Wednesday night netted about 30 bids from as 
far away as Australia and the United Kingdom, 
Gioia said.
The price, which includes a 15 percent 
buyers fee, was very good for the apparently 
one-of-a-kind item, Gioia said.
The seller, a Los Angeles collector who 
bought it earlier this year, also remained 
anonymous.
The recording, made by Capitol Records,
features phone interviews from March 11, 
1964, with all four Beatles, along with Brian 
Wilson of the Beach Boys and surf guitarist 
Dick Dale, Gioia said.
During the interview, the Beatles discussed 
the filming of their upcoming movie A Hard 
Days Night. Wilson detailed the reasons he 
liked the groups music, and Dale commented 
on the Beatles haircuts.
Damage to be released 
in February
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Arnold 
Schwarzeneggers Collateral Damage, a terror
ist thriller whose release was postponed after 
the September 11 attacks, has been resched
uled for early next year.
Warner Bros, plans to release the film 
February 8, said Dan Fellman, the studios 
head of distribution. The film originally was 
slotted for an October release.
The studio set a new release date after a 
recent screening of Collateral Damage for a test 
audience, which reacted positively to the 
movie, Fellman said.
Schwarzenegger plays a Los Angeles fire
fighter on a revenge mission against the 
Colombian terrorist whose bomb killed his 
wife and son.

LOS ANGELES (AP)  Wizards 
vanquished lizards as Harry 
Potter and the Sorcerers Stone 
grossed $93.5 million in its first 
weekend, shattering the boxoffice debut record held by the 
dinosaur sequel The Lost World: 
Jurassic Park.
Other records also fell by the 
wayside. Harry Potter posted the 
top three one-day box office 
hauls, according to studio esti
mates Sunday.
And it positioned itself to 
become the fastest movie to hit 
$100 million, with a shot at cross
ing that mark in its fourth day on 
Monday. It took five days to reach 
that level for Star Wars: Episode I
 The Phantom Menace.
Lost World took in $72.1 million 
in its first three days over the 1997 
Memorial Day weekend. If the boxoffice estimate holds when final 
numbers are reported Monday, 
Harry Potter will have surpassed 
the $90.1 million Lost World 
grossed in its first four days.
On Friday, Harry Potter broke 
the record for best single-day take 
with $31.6 million, topping the 
previous best of $28.5 million by 
Phantom Menace in its opening 
day in 1999.
On Saturday, Harry Potter 
broke its own record by taking in 
$32.9 million. And distributor 
Warner Bros, estimated the 
movies Sunday ticket sales at $29 
million, which would give the 
film the No. 3 best one-day gross.
We obviously knew going in 
we were going to have a great 
opening, said Dan Fellman, 
Warners head of distribution. 
Nobody anticipated such a stag
gering number that would shatter 
every industry record.
Based on the first book of 
British author J.K. Rowlings 
adventure series about a school 
for wizards and witches, Harry 
Potter was directed by Chris 
Columbus and stars Daniel 
Radcliffe in the title role.
They have little time to bask in 
the films success. Production on 
Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
Secrets begins Monday in London, 
with Warner planning to have it in 
theaters the weekend before 
Thanksgiving next year. The stu
dio hopes to do the same with the 
third Harry Potter movie in 2003.
Monsters, Inc., the No. 1 film for 
the previous two weekends, fell to 
second place with $23 million. 
Disneys decision to put the ani
mated tale into theaters two 
weeks before Harry Potter has 
paid off: Monsters, Inc. set a 
record for best debut for an ani
mated movie and had taken in 
$156.7 million in just 17 days.
The top 12 movies grossed 
$157.1 million, up 6.6 percent 
from the same weekend a year 
ago when four movies opened in 
wide release, including the block
buster Dr. Seuss How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas.
The two-and-a-half-hour run
ning time of Harry Potter limits 
the number of screenings that 
theaters can squeeze in each day. 
Warner compensated by debuting 
the film in a record 3,672 the
aters, which showed it on about 
8,200 screens  nearly onefourth of the nations total.
Harry Potter averaged $25,467 
a theater. Monsters averaged 
$19,332 in 3,237 theaters in its 
debut.
I think in the wake of 
September 11, people are looking 
for entertainment close to home, 
said Paul Dergarabedian, presi
dent of Exhibitor Relations, which 
tracks the box office. llHarry 
Potter plays right into that. Its a 
fantasy world people can get out 
of the house and enjoy for a few 
hours, but stay relatively close to 
home.
Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at North 
American theaters, according to 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released 
Monday.
1. Harry Potter and the
Sorcerers Stone, $93.5 million.
2. Monsters, Inc., $23 million.
3. Shallow Hal, $12.7 million.
4. Domestic Disturbance, $5.6
million.
5. Heist, $4.7 million.
6. The One, $4.2 million.
7. K-PAX, $3.3 million.
8. The Wash, $3 million.
9. Life As a House, $2.7 million.
10.13 Ghosts, $2.2 million.

The Phatmaster
http://phat.res.cmu.edu/phatmaster/
In general, life sucked, but 
every so often something quite 
remarkable would happen. One 
time, while at the zoo, my 
clumsy cousin bumped into an 
alphabetized list of animals and 
scattered them, but somehow in 
time proportional to the total 
number of characters in their 
names, I managed to construct a new sorted list.________________
My parents died under mysterious 
circumstances when I was only a 
year old, and ever since then 
I was forced to live in a 
cupboard beneath the stairs in 
my evil aunt and uncle's house.
As punishment, my uncle gave m< 
a scrubdown when we got home, 
but somehow by the next day I 
had returned to my usual foul, greasy self.
When my seventeenth birthday 
came up, the mailbox suddenly 
began to overflow with ads for 
various technical universities. 
Eventually my aunt broke down 
and admitted that my parents 
were computer scientists who 
perished from chronic Repetitive 
Stress Injury. I was granted 
permission to go to school, 
but they could hardly stop me if they'd wanted to.
Although this didn't win me anj 
friends, it made me a star 
Geekball player, eventually 
leading to the loss of my 
virginity.
At school, with no one to tell me what to do, I began to wear an eyepatch and quit washing altogether.

Awesome Tangerine-Glazed Turkey:
10 pounds whole turkey, neck and giblets reserved
2 1/4 cups Apple/ Cranberry Stuffing 
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened 
3/4 cup canola oil
1 1/2 cups tangerine juice
2 1/4 cups turkey stock
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
salt and pepper to taste
1
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Chop 
turkey neck and giblets and set aside.
2
Clean turkey, and season body cavity with salt and pepper. 
Loosely pack neck cavity with 1/2 cup stuffing. Fold the 
neck skin under the body, and fasten with a skewer. Loosely 
pack the body cavity with remaining stuffing. Tie together 
drumsticks, spread half the butter over the turkey, and sea
son with salt and pepper. Place turkey in a shallow roasting 
pan.
3
Melt remaining butter in a medium saucepan over medi
um heat and mix with canola oil and tangerine juice.
Remove from heat and allow to cool about 5 minutes. Soak 
a piece of cheesecloth large enough to drape over the turkey 
in the mixture.
4
Roast turkey 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce 
oven temperature to 325 degrees F (110 degrees C). Drape 
turkey with the soaked cheesecloth. Continue roasting 1 
hour. Leaving the cheesecloth draped over the turkey, baste 
with the tangerine juice mixture. Basting every 20 minutes, 
continue roasting about 2 hours, until the internal tempera
ture of the thigh meat reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) 
and the stuffing inside the body cavity reaches 165 degrees 
F (70 degrees C). Reserve pan juices and 1/4 cup remaining 
fat, and allow turkey to cool about 25 minutes before remov
ing stuffing.
5
In the baking pan, mix pan juices with 1/4 cup turkey 
stock and deglaze over high heat. In a medium saucepan 
over low heat, whisk together reserved fat and flour 3 min
utes. Stir in turkey neck and giblets, deglazed mixture, 
reserved fat, and remaining turkey stock. Stirring constant
ly, simmer 10 minutes until giblets are cooked through. 
Strain through a sieve, and serve with the turkey and stuff
ing.

Although not Canadian, Harry Potter is British. Which is close enough. Technically, 
Canada is still part of the Commonwealth. Harry, being British, cleary does not cel
ebrate Thanksgiving. However, this isnt totally useless to him. In England, and in 
fact throughout much of the Commonwealth, Christmas dinner is traditionally com
posed of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. Pumpkins arent big in England; 
hence, no pumpkin pie. However, Brits do fancy rice pudding.
