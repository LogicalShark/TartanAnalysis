A second great loss to the Design 
School occurred in the death of Arthur

ARTHUR G' BURGOYNE 
Music and Aesthetics. Mr. Burgoyne 
was taken ill with pneumonia a week 
ago today, resulting in his death last 
Monday morning at 2 oclock.
Mr. Burgoyne was born in Ireland, 
the son of the queens inspector of 
schools. He was graduated from 
Rockwell College, Ireland, at the age 
of 20. Later he finished with honor at 
the University of London and Royal 
Academy at London. After complet
ing his courses abroad he came to 
Pittsburgh, accepting a position as 
professor of German and mathematics; 
soon after he became principal of the 
Ralston public school.
Along with this work, Mr. Burgoyne 
became active in newspaper circles, 
when in 1890 he entered the regular 
staff of the Pittsburgh Leader as edi
tor. When the Pittsburgh Gazette 
and Pittsburgh Times were merged 
in 1906, he joined the editorial staff, 
where he remained until the present 
date.
Mr* Burgoyne was a music, art and 
literary critic of note. His writings 
were both humorous and serious, grip
ping and holding the interest of his 
readers with their charm. He was

The track team sprang a surprise 
on local colleges in the P. A. A. meet 
on Saturday night by taking enough 
points to place second in the team 
scores. The P. A. A. team, mainly 
with Tech veterans, won the highest 
score, but the Varsity placed second, 
tying with Pitt. A full team was not 
entered, ana the relay team did not 
run, but the few athletes that com
peted for the Plaid placed high in 
every event, and showed the best form.
As expected, Haselton won the twomile run and set a new school mark 
of 10:18 in so doing. Six men started 
and the race was one of the prettiest 
of the evening. Haselton took the 
lead soon after the first half mile and 
he was never headed, although the 
Indian, Nash, followed him closely. 
The first mile was run in 5:04, with 
Hasey traveling easily. With Nash 
trailing close on his heels and Grumb
ling of Pitt following about ten yards 
behind, the rest of the runners were 
left in the distance, and the race lay 
between the wearer of the Tartan and 
the red-skin. On the last lap, Nash 
tried to take the pole from Haselton 
and tripped, falling to the floor. The 
Indian scrambled gamely to his feet 
and resumed his sprint, but Brumbling 
was in full stride and took second place 
by inches. Haselton led by twenty 
yards at the tape. Although the time 
was fast, there is little doubt that Has
elton can better the mark and a sen
sational record can be expected for 
the distance in some later meet.
Rauh was our only entry in the 60- 
yard novice race and he won the event 
in fast time. His trial heat was run 
in 6 4-5 seconds, the fastest of the 
trials, and he traveled the final in 
seven seconds flat. He had seven 
good men against him, but he proved 
speedier than any of them.
King got a poor start in the 60-yard 
hurdles and placed only third in his 
trial heat, which did not entitle him to 
a place in the finals. The final event 
was won by Hammett, of State, with 
Halferty, former Tech captain and 
P. A. A. leader, a close second. King, 
however, brought honor to the team 
in the high jump, tying with Myers 
and Harry Murphy, of P. A. A., for 
first place. Murphy jumped for Car
negie before joining P. A. A. and is 
Kings best rival in the district. All 
three men cleared five feet eleven 
inches, but failed at six feet. King 
had both feet over the bar twice, but
COACH STEFANS 
DUE NEXT WEEK
on each attempt knocked the bar off 
with his body. In the toss-up, King 
won the gold medal that went to first 
place.
MacMillan ran a good race in the 
six-lap (1056 yards) run, finishing a 
good third. He was beaten by Brown 
of Michigan and Matt Marshall, the 
Pitt captain. The time was excep
tionally fast.
Hemmann competed in the 60-yard 
open event and in the two-lap open 
run and finished well up in both. He 
was among the five that bunched in 
the shorter race which Carroll won by 
setting a new A. A. U. record, and 
equaling the worlds record. In the 
two-lap event he crossed the finish 
line fourth after a hard race.
Jos. Williams, of the Varsity, al
though competing for the East Lib
erty Y. M. C. A., captured second 
place in the one-mile walk, a handi
cap event. This was one of the comic 
events of the evening, the different 
forms of walking furnishing unlim
ited amusement to the spectators.
Campbell made an excellent show
ing in the one-mile run. His handicap 
of 15 yards was the nearest to scratch 
that any runner started with, but he 
finished a good fourth to the winner, 
Nash, who had an allowance of 65 
yards and two others who started from 
50-yard handicaps. Ex-Capt. Wait 
also started from 15 yards, but Camp
bell was ahead of him at the finish.
The Pennsylvania College relay race 
was a farce. The Carlisle Indians and 
Penn State ran a good race and fin
ished in the order named, but, for 
some reason known to the officials 
and not to the spectators, the event 
was awarded to the Pitt team, the 
last man of which finished yards in 
the rear of his competitors. The time 
announced was also evidently that of 
the Indians. Carnegie Tech had no 
team in this event, so were not in
jured by the decision.
The feature event of the evening, 
a relay race between Cornell and 
Michigan, was interesting but not es
pecially cxciting. The real race was 
between the first two men, Souter of 
Cornell and Haff of Michigan, Irish 
and Griest made interesting going in 
their five laps, but Michigans third 
man lost ground that the final runner 
could not regain, and Cornell won by 
an easy margin.
Wright did well in the pole vault, 
clearing 10 feet 6 inches, and tying

Coach Steffins of the football team, 
will arrive in Pittsburgh on next Mon
day, March 30, and will start work 
with the squad immediately. He will 
allow himself a day to look over the 
schools and the facilities before start
ing the spring training season. Con
sequently, Manager Rownd has issued 
a call for all men interested in foot
ball to meet Coach Steffins in the 
Field House on Tuesday afternoon 
March 31. Naturally, players and pros
pective players are wanted, but any 
other men who wish to help the sport 
in the Institute in any way will be 
welcome. A large crowd of boosters 
will give Mr. Steffins the encourage
ment of the idea that the student body 
is back of him, so take this opportu
nity to meet the man that will put 
Carnegie Tech on the football ways 
this year.
STAG lT - ! !
On Saturday, March 28th, there will 
be held in Machinery Hall one of the 
greatest exhibitions of the follies of 
frivolous youth that the students of 
Carnegie have ever been able to wit
ness. This will be the second of a 
series of entertainments that have 
been planned by the Ways and Means 
Committee. Those who were at the 
last one will admit that it was en
tirely a success. However, this one 
will surpass all former knowings. 
There will be dancing exhibitions that 
will appeal to the most ardent lovers 
of the terpsichorean art. There will 
be present some of the greatest per
formers that have ever appeared upon 
the American stage. Acrobats, equili
brists, dancers, singers, jokers, kidders, and performers of all the mod
ern stunts will be there. Yes, they 
will be there great and small, lanky, 
lean, fat and tall.
Aside from all this, there will be 
an indoor track meet. Some of the 
best athletes on the continent will be 
there. Members of the different class
es have been training for months in 
order to carry off laurels at this cen
tury fair. And then there will be one 
of the greatest feeds that the best 
stewards of the city have been able 
to prepare. All the students of the 
Science School are invited to attend 
this wonderful display of amusements.

ARTHUR G. BURGOY.V.
Once again, the School of Applied 
Design has suffered an irreparable loss 
in the death of one of its most effi
cient professors, and the entire Insti
tute of Technology joins with the De
sign School in mourning for this emi
nent man.
Mr. Burgoyne was exceptionally 
well-liked and admired in all circles 
around Pittsburgh. As a newspaper 
editor he was most prominent, and 
his loss is keenly felt by those with 
whom he was associated in that work. 
As a music and art critic he was rec
ognized to be one of the foremost 
authorities in the country. As a lin
guist, he possessed unusual ability. 
His work in the School of Applied 
Design was gaining full deserved ap
preciation, and his death is extremely 
unfortunate for the Department of 
Music and Esthetics.
Mr. Burgoyne was a man of most 
lovable character; his kindness and 
ready sympathy made friends wher
ever he went; his generosity to un
fortunates was a well-known trait. His 
relations with his students were of 
the most intimate nature, and they all 
must miss him sorely.
SClV.CV .lGHT.
Another affair for the entire student 
body of the Science School is to be 
held on Saturday evening, March the 
28th. Remembering the success of the 
Stag Dance, which was the first of a 
series of these nights, we know that 
this coming Saturday evening will have 
a pleasant surprise in store for all 
those students who are present.
We should like to see a larger rep
resentation from all four classes, but
especially from the Seniors and Jun
iors, who fell away below the average 
for the two lower classes at the Stag 
Dance. Every upper-class man ought 
to consider it his privilege and duty 
to be present at these affairs. It is 
undoubted that we are going to build 
up a wholesome school spirit by this 
community of interest between the 
four classes and the faculty. So the 
upper classes should support these 
affairs to the extent of their ability, 
for we look to them to set the stand
ards of a fine Carnegie spirit, and to 
instill in the under-class men the same 
spirit which they themselves have 
achieved during their years at Car
negie.
The Ways and Means Committee of 
the ladies of the Faculty have consent
ed to be present Saturday evening, and 
the Student Committee is making spe
cial arrangements for the event, so we 
know that a very enjoyable evening 
will be had by all. Each student should 
bring the tag bearing his name, if he 
has kept this tag since the Stag Dance. 
If not, the tags will be supplied as 
before.
SlG. BOARD ADVVRTlSl.G.
It can scarcely be said that our 
campus has yet attained an attractive 
appearance. This, of course, is due to 
the continuous building operations. 
But in any way that we are able we 
should all be willing to help make 
things more beautiful around the 
schools.
Recently, the building used for a re
pair shop and garage has been artisti
cally decorated with signs advertising 
certain school activities. The building 
itself is not an especially valuable ad
dition to our group, but there is no 
advantage to be gained in making a 
bad matter worse. For the last few 
weeks everyone coming up Woodlawn 
avenue, whether student or otherwise, 
has been greeted each morning by 
these advertisements. We think it a 
very bad idea to plaster up any of our 
buildings with such signs, and we are 
glad to note that they have now been 
finally removed.
Naturally, we have no objection to 
legitimate advertising of all school 
activities. But for that purpose there 
are bulletin boards in all four schools, 
and signs placed upon these boards 
will receive the deserved attention 
from' the student body. It seems, 
then, rather unnecessary to make sign
boards of our buildings. Let us, on the 
contrary, do all we can to make and 
keep things more attractive around our 
Institute.
BULLVTl. BOARDS.
A great eyesore to all are the stu
dent bulletin boards in the various 
buildings. It would almost seem as if 
they were a necessary evil. In every 
school, when one wants a notice post
ed, the notice finds a place on the 
board regardless of whether it is over 
one equally important or not. Every
one that posts a notice should see that 
it is removed immediately after its pur
pose is accomplished. In this way the 
boards would not be so congested.
By the exercise of a little care, the 
bulletin boards could be brought to the 
place where they are no longer an eye
sore to the passerby.

STUDV.T olLlTARY CAoPS.
Elsewhere in this issue will be found 
a description of the student military 
instruction camp which was held last 
summer at Gettysburg. From the ar
ticle, one may judge that the men had 
a very fine time, and were given an 
interesting insight into army life.
The Advisory Board, consisting of 
the Presidents of Princeton, Harvard, 
Yale, Michigan, Alabama, California, 
Virginia Military Institute, the College 
of the City of New York, and Lehigh 
University, reported very favorably on 
last years work. Summarized, their 
report to the Secretary of War reads:
The military instruction was thor
ough. The discipline was strict; but 
the work was so well arranged that 
it caused enjoyment rather than hard
ship. The food, sanitation, and medi
cal care were good, and the lessons re
ceived by the students in these matters 
were scarcely less valuable than the 
military instruction itself. We com
mend these camps to the attention of 
college authorities as a most import
ant adjunct to the educational system 
of the United States, furnishing the 
student a healthful and profitable sum
mer course at moderate expense.
This year there are to be four camps 
in various sections of the country, each 
to last for a period of five weeks. A 
fine training will be given in Infantry 
drill and manoeuvres, and also in the 
Artillery, Cavalry, and Engineering 
Corps. The War Department details 
troops of all branches to these camps 
for the instruction of the men.
We believe that here is an excellent 
opportunity for unengaged students 
to get a short course in military train
ing, so that if our country ever needs 
them they will be ready. Aside from 
this patriotic motive, there must be 
considered the physical benefits of ac
tive, healthful, outdoor life at a small 
expense, the valuable opportunity for 
association with college men from 
other institutions, and the formation 
of habits of discipline, obedience, com
mand and self-control, which every 
man should have.

There will be a meeting of the Band 
Men in the A. I. Club Room on Fri
day, March 27, at 5 oclock. The man
ager has talked to many of the men 
who play band instruments, but per
haps not all of them. Even if all have 
not been spoken to, each man who 
plays a band instrument should be at 
this meeting. Rehearsals and con
certs may require a sacrifice on the 
part of many of these men, but the 
fact remains that Tech needs their 
help, their co-operation, and above all 
their presence in the band. This real 
obligation to the schools should not 
be overlooked. Men, come out! Lets 
have a good band to encourage the 
baseball men in their efforts this sea
son.

To the Editor of the Tartan:
Those of us who are dyed-in-the 
wool Progressives are apt to think 
that if we can only get back to an 
unlimited formof democracy all our 
difficulties will be solved. We are 
inclined to assume that there is some
thing in collective effort which as
sures right results. The great func
tion of Democracy is, however, not 
necessarily to do anything very well, 
but, as President Jordan puts it, to 
develop intelligence and patriotism 
through doing for ourselves all things 
possible which concern us individu
ally or collectively. To take respon
sibility is the surest way to rise to 
it, but the time may be long and 
errors may be costly. Courage and 
willingness do not guarantee success. 
Exact knowledge and thorough train
ing are essential to right results.
To what extent may a technical 
training contribute toward good citizen
ship*? Merely to increase a mans mon
ey earning capacity does not always 
make him a better citizen. Not even 
does increased intellectual power invari
ably lead to a higher quality of citizen
ship. The greatest political danger of 
today does not come directly from ig
norance, but from the use made of ig
norance by the intelligence of organized 
power, with the tacit consent of the in
telligence of culture. But any educa
tion of value to the community, whether 
it be technical or academic, must mean 
something more than greater earning or 
intellectual power. It should mean a 
respect for and a devotion to truth in 
every formit should mean the realiza
tion of an obligation of service beyond 
the selfish aim of the advancement of 
the individual. Without this, educa
tion may even become a menace to the 
state.
"Given this ideal of the subordination 
of private interests to the public good, 
when private interests and public wel
fare are in opposition, the training af
forded by such an institution as ours 
becomes of great value to the communi
ty. It is, of course, true that compara
tively little in the line of direct train
ing for the duties of citizenship will 
find place in a technical course of study; 
a few courses in economics, in the his
tory of politics, etc., make up the total. 
It is just as true, however, that the in
troduction into a community of the man 
of trained mind, of the man accustomed 
to weigh carefully the evidence and to 
reach conclusions based solely upon the 
truth as he sees it, cannot but raise the 
general average of intelligence in that 
community and thereby bring about bet
ter civic conditions. The present is a 
time when as never before the trained 
mind is needed not only in public office, 
but in the simplest exercises of citizen
ship. We are now looking to the state 
for the solution of many problems in the 
economic adjustment of laws made for 
a past order to the changed conditions 
of today. The questions of our finan-j 
cial system, of trusts, of equal suffrage,
of taxation, of the minimum wage and 
indeed most of the questions before us 
as a people today cannot be decided 
upon mere sentiment. They demand the 
specialist for their solution, and require 
the trained mind for even an intelligent 
vote. Then, too, there are in every com
munity questions of city planning and 
industrial development for the solution 
of which the technical man is preemi
nently qualified.
But the duty of the man of trained 
mind is not fulfilled merely by casting 
an intelligent vote. He should exer
cise a positive influence upon the forma
tion of public opinion in his community. 
The number of college men in any com
munity is so relatively small that he finds 
open to him exceptional opportunities 
for leadership. I do not mean that he 
becomes a leader by virtue of his di
ploma alone. He will have to prove his 
worth in competition with men without 
the wisdom of books, but as truly edu
cated as the college graduate. He must 
make his place, and, if he has but the 
common sense which will throw his 
knowledge into the right perspective, he 
will find his place. If he is to hold that 
place, his interest must be broader than 
his specialty. He must do his part to
ward the formation of the opinion and 
sentiment of the community upon public 
questions and toward the direction of 
that sentiment to a clearly defined pur
pose.
We are apt to discuss good citizen
ship as if it were a thing of abstract 
principles and ideals, whereas, it is really 
a very simple and practical thing. It is 
a matter of details. Citizens are made 
by doing the things for which at any 
time citizenshhip stands, says President 
Tucker. It is his failure to perform the 
simple detailed duties of citizenship that 
has made the college man the target 
of ridicule by the political writers of our 
daily press. But his indifference has 
done more than this. By his neglect of 
his civic duties, he gives his tacit con
sent to the existence of that most power
ful enemy of good government, the po
litical machine. Citizenship is assigned 
too low a rank in the thoughts and plans 
of many college men.
At the present time there seems to be 
an awakening of interest in public ques
tions among all classes of people. Dur
ing the early formative period of our 
government the interest in politics and 
political questions was intense, as was 
natural. Then for years slavery, which 
involved a moral as well as an econom
ic issue, furnished the fuel for heated 
discussions. Since slavery and the civil 
war have become dead issues, we have 
had no questions until recently which 
appealed strongly to the moral or patri
otic sentiment of the people. How true 
this is is seen by the length of time po
litical capital was made out of war is
sues by the spread eagle orators of our 
political parties. The economic ques
tions of the tariff and the trusts are vital, 
but they were not such as to fire the im
agination of the rank and file. The di
rect bearing of these and other economic 
questions upon the rights and the hap
piness of the individual, however, is now 
realized and as a consequence they have

MUSICAL AT M. M. C. S.
The M. M. C. S. heard on Thursday, 
March 19, 1914, in the assembly, a 
splendid concert by Mr. and Mrs. 
Phillips, of London, England. Mrs. 
Phillips was formerly Miss Ethel 
Barns, a noted violinist; while Mr. 
Phillips is Master of the Voice in the 
Royal Academy of Music, London, 
England. They were both accom
panied by Miss Reid at the piano.
The first number on the program 
was a concert composed by Mrs. Phil
lips for a large orchestra with a solo 
for the violin. This was first played 
in Queens Hall, London, and the solo 
part was played by Mrs. Phillips.
Mr. Phillips followed by singing 
four songs. He made the songs very 
interesting by first telling the story

Mrs. Phillips rendered four selec
tions which showed the various types 
of music.
The Maid of Athens, Soul of 
Mine, a composition by Mrs. Phillips, 
and The Dear Little Girl, were then 
given by Mr. Phillips, accompanied on 
the piano by his wife.
After the concert a reception was 
given for the faculty and students to 
meet Mr. and Mrs. Phillips.
THE SOPHOMORE DANCE.
The Sophomore Class of M. M. C. S. 
held a dance in the school gymnasium 
Friday, March 20. The hall was at
tractively decorated in the class colors 
and penants. At the conclusion of the 
dancing a dainty supper was served 
in the lunch room. The chairman of 
the committee in charge was Miss 
Charlotte Watson.
STAINED GLASS LECTURE.
Mr. Lawrence B. Saint gave a lec
ture on Stained Glass of the Middle 
Ages in England and France, last 
Tuesday afternoon. He illustrated the 
lecture by his own drawings thrown 
on the screen. He told of the methods 
employed in those periods and the 
development until the present day. 
The lecture was made intensely inter
esting by his addition of the circum
stances under which his drawings were 
obtained.
Mr. Saint claims to have acquired 
his inspiration for stained glass work 
from Mr. George Sotter, one of our 
instructors in art, while here in Pitts
burgh. Mr. Saint was formerly of 
Pittsburgh.

Brigade, which made the memorable 
charge in the Crimean War. Mrs. 
Phillips, who is professionally better 
known under her maiden name, Ethel 
Barns, is one of the most gifted woman 
composers of the day, her works now 
numbering nearly two hundred, con
sisting of songs, sonatas for violin, be
rceuses, trios for violin, cello and

Outdoor Season Awaited lmpatiently.
Baseball practice is moving forward 
rapidly these days, even if the team 
is confined indoors. Rehearsals are 
held every Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday afternoons at four and on Sat
urdays at two, and the large troupe 
of performers are training hard to 
stage their stunts on the diamond when 
King Winter makes up his mind to 
travel northward. The atni'osphere 
in the gym is rapidly approaching that 
of out-of-doors as the windows give 
way before the attack of the balls.
Cunningham invented a method of 
removing two panes at a time that 
threatens to be disastrous to break
age fees* All of the other men are 
also improving in form.
According to rumor, Pete DeMuth 
may be seen at first base this year 
and Tiny Brine at third. These are 
new positions for both men, but some 
way must be found of bolstering up 
the infield, and using th veterans to 
the best advantage. It has been found 
to be easier to dvelope good out
fielders than to train sack-men. How
ever, all plans depend upon the work 
of the candidates in the field, and no 
bets should be placed until warmer 
weather arrives.
Word has been received that our 
opening game will be played on Forbes 
Field, Pluvius willing. Pitt is to be 
met on April 18, and the Pirates will 
not be playing at home on that date. 
So Manager Roth is scouting through 
the three schools to find a prototype 
of the Great Honus to fill the vacancy 
at shortstop.
It is a noticeable fact that most of 
the candidates for the team this year 
are from the Industries School, with 
an unusual dearth of Science Plebes 
on the squad. The Industries men are 
to be congratulated, but something 
must be done to arouse the other 
schools. Never before has there been 
such a chance for a new man to make 
the team, and never before was there 
such a need for good, medium or in
different material. There is not a po
sition on the team that can be said 
to be filled, and any kind of players, 
from pitchers to bat-boys, will get a 
good, honest try-out.
Ex-manager Grotefend is canvass
ing last years letter men for the elec
tion of a captain. Hall failed to enter 
school and left for Gettysburg last 
week. The vote must be collected by 
mail, but it is hoped that the name of 
the new leader may be announced 
within a week. A captain will cer
tainly be in charge by the time the 
squad takes to the athletic field.

STUDV.T olLlTARY l.STRUC
TlO. CAoPS.
The Students Military Institution 
Camp, which was held last summer at 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was a 
marked success, all the men who at
tended agreeing that they had never 
had a better time during the summer 
at so little cost. Not only was the 
life one of enjoyment and pleasure, 
but it gave the men an intensely interest
ing insight into and experience of 
army service conditions. The practi
cal value of the information received, 
the extensive field covered, and the 
interesting way in which the men were 
taught cannot be too strongly empha
sized.
An idea of the camp can be gained 
from the following survey which ex
plains in full detail the cost, daily life, 
and benefits to be derived.
Cost Slight.
For the entire period of five weeks 
it cost the six Princeton men about 
$19 apiece for all necessities except 
transportation to and from the camp. 
The meals, comprising plenty of 
wholesome food, were surprisingly 
good; this cost about $1.75 a week per 
man. The uniform consisted of: 2
cotton olive-drab colored shirts; 2 
pairs of riding breeches; a pair of leg
gings; and a soft felt campaign hat. 
The whole outfit costs from $5 to $10. 
Tents, blankets, folding cots, ponchos, 
sweaters, mess kits, canteens, riflles, 
bayonets, shelter tents, in short, a com
plete infantry outfit for a private in 
the army is furnished free of charge 
by the War Department. The Gov
ernment also provides an efficient 
corps of Army men to instruct the 
campers and does everything to main
tain the health and comfort of those 
attending.
lnteresting Daily Routine.
For the first three weeks the camp 
was located on the battlefield of Get
tysburg and the daily routine was 
somewhat as follows: First call at
5:30 a. m.; Roll call 5:30, Assembly 
5:45 followed by a snappy set up 
drill for 15 minutes, Breakfast 6:00, 
Sick Call and Fatigue or Police or 
Fatigue 6:45; Assembly at 7:45, and 
then, for three hours, practical instruc
tions in military tactics. The men 
learned about advance and rear guard 
duty, patrols, various departments of 
the engineering, medical, and signal 
corps, infantry, cavalry and artillery 
drills. And finally as the men became 
proficient, sham battles with the regu
lars were organized, thus teaching the 
students the most up-to-date methods 
of modern warfare.
The following are some of the meth
ods in instruction: One morning the
company was divided up into three 
groups of 50 men each and each part 
given one hours instruction in caval
ry drill, artillery manoeuvres, and con
tour map making respectively. An
other time the company watched the 
engineer staff quickly erect a bridge 
strong enough to hold the gun car
riages or caissons, weight at least 10,-
000 lbs. They were also shown how 
to completely destroy such a bridge 
using a very small amount of explos
ives. On another day the students de
fended the hill just outside of Gettys
burg against Company C of the Engi
neers. These sham battles were under
taken very seriously; the men being 
compelled to find the range and wind
age as if in a regular battle. The 
programs of the morning contained 
many other interesting features and 
was varied so that every man learned 
a great deal about the general organi
zation and tactics of Army life.
The schedule for the late morning 
hours and afternoons was as follows: 
Recall 10:25; Lectures 10:45; Dinner 
12:00; Fatigue 5:00; Supper 5:30; Taps 
10:30. The lectures were delivered by 
the different officers in camp or by out
side men especially invited for the oc
casion. These lectures were so inter
esting and instructive that a great 
many men made careful notes for their 
own personal use. They were con
ducted informally, however, and the 
men not obliged to study or take notes 
on them.
The afternoons were spent accord
ing to personal inclination. Baseball 
teams were organized and played 
games throughout the season. There 
were also opportunities for cavalry 
riding, artillery drill, or gallery prac
tice with the rifles. A special feature 
was Major McAndrews visit to the 
Camp. Employing three afternoons, 
Major McAndrews took the Camp all 
over the battle-field devoting one after
noon each to an explanation of the 
tactics and history of the 3 days battle 
at Gettysburg.
In the evening there was usually a 
concert by the Fifth Infantry band fol
lowed by Movies in the open tent. 
During the season there were several 
dances which were well attended and 
enjoyed.
The Final Hike.
On July 31, the men left Gettysburg 
and spent the remaining time on a hike 
to Mt. Gretna at a distance of 65 miles. 
The journey was made in 7 days the 
men moving and acting as a regular 
army on the march. Each man carried 
light packs besides his rifle but had 
little trouble in making the trip as they 
took it in easy stages, engaging in sham 
battles with the regulars at frequent 
intervals. The men slept in shelter 
tents on the ground or on hay pro
cured from some neighboring farmer.
After arriving at Mt. Gretna the men 
put up the regular. pyramid tents in 
which they lived more comfortably. 
Using the state rifle range many of the 
students qualified for Marks-man by 
making 92 out of a possible 150. Camp 
was finally broken on August 14, the 
men receiving their certificates of at
tendance.
Four Camps This Summer.
Owing to the popularity of the Camp 
and the increased number of students, 
plans have been made for the estab
lishment of four camps for the coming 
season. They will be located in Bur
lington, Vt., from July 6 to August 7, 
Monterey, Cal., from June 26 to July 
31, Ashville, N. C., and the southern 
shore of Lake Michigan. The board 
has been slightly increased to $3.50 
per week but the food will be corres
pondingly better. The dates for the
two last places will be announced later.
All the men who went last year guar
antee that any men attending the Camp 
will not only find much pleasure and 
enjoyment, but will acquire a knowl
edge which at all times will be of great 
value not only to the men themselves 
but also in raising the standard and 
efficiency of the average American citi
zen. Further particulars regarding the 
Camp may be had from Captain R. O. 
VanHorn, General Staff, U. S. War 
Department, Washington, D. C.

ter. 3:00 P. M. Grand Lake on the 
horizon N. N. W. of our position. Ad
venture in sight, later in the day 
passed us. Whitecoats aplenty, posi
tion about 90 miles E. N. E. of the 
Funk Islands. 6:00 P. M. Sad news. 
Steve Martin, our fireman who had 
been complaining of his back all day, 
left his berth to go to the boiler room 
and expired in the arms of the second 
engineer. I left supper and tried every 
means of resuscitation I knew of, be
ing 6:45 p. m. when I ceased. I ad
vised Capt. Winsor, who was present, 
to signal the Neptune for a doctor. 
(As this ship was about a half mile 
away) this was done. Doctor arrived 
aboard 7:30 p. m. over the loose ice 
and pronounced death from heart fail
ure. A stout pine box was made by 
the carpenter and filled with ice into 
this, a coffin with the body was placed, 
the whole being hoisted on to the 
gallows where it laid with a Union 
Jack covering it until the voyage was 
ended, when the body was consigned 
to mother earth by the relatives.
March 12Wind W. N. W. with 
light snow showers. A few scattered 
whitecoats to be seen, three taken 
about daylight by one Jim Dawson, 
who jumped from the main chains, 
while the ship was moving and flung 
all three on deck. 8:00 a. m. Nep
tune alongside. Men are towing the 
ship with a long cable for exercise. 
Very frosty, 10 degrees below zero. 
Heavy arctic ice as far as the eye 
can see. 4:30 p. m., about 500 white
coats aboard. Neptune on the same 
business. Extremely frosty, blowing 
strong from N. W. 6 p. m.Very thick 
weather. Captain is calling the men 
aboard by siren.
March 13Wind N. N. W., blowing 
a hurricane. This is surely a winter 
day. Neptune on our port bow, about 
a mile distant. 5:00 p. m.Taking 
quite a number of seals, about 1,200 
aboard. Prospects, good. Position of 
ship in latitude of Gray Islands ice 
is now assuming an uneven surface, 
making traveling difficult for hunters.
March 14. Wind E. N. E. Intensely 
cold, 15 degrees below zero. The men 
at the wheel can scarcely stand. Tak
ing scattered seals. Bad glare on the 
ice as the sun is very brilliant. 10:00 
a. m. Acted quartermaster being off 
watch, as the captains voice could not 
be heard by steersmen. Wind N. E. 
blowing a gale, about 70 miles E. N.
E. of Funk Islands. These islands
are noted for their Guano deposits be
ing a favorite haunt of sea birds. 
11:30 a. m., men are coming aboard 
for flags. 5:30 p. m., Neptune on our 
port bow about three miles away. 
Flags of other ships can be seen as 
we pass along. Adventure five miles 
away on our starboard beam. Ah! 
there goes the bell for supper, no time 
like meal time. This day has been a 
severe one to the men in the Crows 
Nest, one man being totally 'blinded. 
Martin Ring complaining about his 
stomach; hot Jamaica for him. 12:00 
m., eight bells has sounded; another 
watch of four hours. Engines work
ing freely. Tremendous strain on the 
ship, forcing her way through unus
ually heavy ice. 4:00 p. m., sounded 
two bells for next watch. Men blast
ing ice with black powder. Neptune 
steaming away to N. W. We are 
now fairly in the northern jamb, speak
ing to a master watch, 6:30 p. m., who 
told me they did very well today in 
spite of difficulties, frost being the 
hardest obstacle to contend with. 
Steamer butting hard; one can scarce
ly imagine how wood could stand such 
terrific smashes, yet a steel ship would 
be useless in our position. One blow 
such as our ship has been giving these 
last four days would send a steel ship 
to bottom. 8:00 p. m., four bells; this 
time a six-hour watch. Northern lights 
can be seen in all their brilliancy. I 
reversed engines every two minutes 
in this watch, using the hand gear. 
This fact may convey an idea of the 
nature of the ice we were passing 
through. This was the hardest six 
hours work I have ever experienced. 
I accordingly enjoyed six hours solid 
sleep.
March 15. Wind W. N. W. Very 
fine morning. Quite a change from 
that of yesterday. 6:00 a. m.Pick
ing up our flagged pans of seals. Ter
ra Nova on our starboard quarter. 
We have now eight thousand pelts 
aboard. 12:00 in.Young and old 
seals scattered all around the ship. 
The whitecoat is indeed a pretty crea
ture with its black eyes and nose 
looking out from its white skin, in 
contrast to the blue ice, they form 
a strange sight, and one to be ad
mired when seen. 12:30 p. m.Ah! 
Dinner again. I am voted the hearti
est eater in the mess. Young seal 
pie for supper, the cook has an
nounced, but not for me, with many 
regrets. A report just came aboard, 
about 5 :00 p. m., that Neptume hailed 
for 21,000, Adventure 42,000, not cred
ited as a matter of course. We may 
look forward to mythical reports. 
10,000 in the hold is better than 20,-
000 on the Arctic floe. 9:30 p. m. 
Steaming up to our flagged pans, 
which are marked by torches. Men 
on board, stowing pelts. To see the 
flickering lights and bloody pelts, to 
hear the wind whistling through the 
rigging, the hoarse calls of the mas
ter watches and the rumble of the 
winches, impresses one as being alto
gether weird.
March 16. Wind S. W. Picking up 
flagged pans which occupied us from 
6:00 A. M. of the 15th until 7:00 P. M. 
today; two polar bears shot at 9:00
P. M.; nine steamers can now be seen 
along the horizon. Weather soft and 
favorable. Ice open permitting good 
progress. Speaking to one of the
crew about seals in general he made 
the remark that no noggies were 
seen, indicating a prosperous hunt. 
(This is a local name for a seal hav
ing a red colored pelt).
6:30 P. M. Weather coming, thick 
snow showers and generally stormy. 
7:00 P. M. Last of our pelts hoisted 
aboard; in all about 12,000.
March 17. Patricks Day. Wind S. 
Very cold and stormy, occasioned by 
heavy snow showers. On watch from 
8:00 P. M. of the 16th until 2:00 A. M. 
of the 17th. 8:00 A. M. slightly clear
er, though misty.' We are now steam
ing for a promising herd to complete 
our cargo. 10 :00 a. m., have struck the 
herd and the crew are taking them, ex
pecting to load early next week. 2 :00 P. 
M. all the crew overboard is the order 
now. Thirteen steamers are dotted at 
intervals along the sky line. Those 
distinguishable are the Eagle, Al
gerine, Newfoundland, and Diana.
I am compelled to wonder why more 
accidents do not occur to our hardy 
fellows such as drowning, lost in fog, 
snow storms, etc.
This has been a trying day to our 
men on the ice, especially is it so to 
the eyes, otherwise it is very fine for 
Patricks Day. We shall catch it no 
doubt later. From 8:00 P. M. until 
2:00 A. M. of the 18th, burnt down 
(that is, banked the fires) thus having 
a very pleasant watch.

Though advertised chiefly as a Boys 
Meet, the track and field events which 
will be at Duquense Gardens Satur
day afternoon under the auspices of 
the Pittsburgh Press will include a 
number of open events. In the latter 
Tech wil be fully represented. That 
the Plaid team is rounding into form 
was shown at the P. A. A. meet last 
week when Carnegie obtained as many 
points as Pitt. The Blue and Gold 
will not compete day after tomorrow, 
and our chances are consequently 
brighter. The meet will start at 2 
oclock and no admission fee will be 
charged. The following are the Tech 
entries:
60 yard dash handicap: Finley, Hemmann, Dunseith, Rauh, Wohlgemuth, 
Vierheller.
One lap race: Hemmann, Dunseith, 
Rauh.
One mile run: Haselton, MacMillan, 
Campbell, Handleman, Reiser, W'alker, 
Finley.
High jump: King, H. Wright, Vier
heller, Wohlgemuth.
The indoor track season will close 
next Wednesday, April 1, with the 
dual meet against Westinghouse Club 
which was postponed from March 18. 
The recent dual encounter between 
that club and Pitt, gave the Tech run
ners an opportunity to discover their 
opponents strength and during the 
training period particular attention 
will be given to the events, which 
Westinghouse has the best prospects 
of winning. A close meet is assured, 
but the odds favor our team. The 
possession of the Smith trophy is at 
stake and victory will be all the sweet
er served in a silver cup.

Sudden Death of Arthur G. Burgoyne
Continued from Page 1. 
one of the founders of the Associa
tion of American Press Humorists 
which was organized in 1906 at Balti
more. Along with these accomplish
ments he was a linguist, having been 
master of twelve languages.
Mr. Burgoyne was a man of jovial 
character. He was well liked around 
newspaper circles and in our school. 
He was a friend of everybodys and 
never refused the request for aid from 
a down and out. He had explicit 
faith in the school, especially the 
music department in which he was an 
instructor. He organized the Design 
School Orchestra, and was of inval
uable assistance to all its members. 
The Design school loses one of the 
strongest links in its chain of pro
ficient instruction.
The Design School omitted classes 
both day and night Wednesday, March 
25th. A resolution of respect and 
honor to Arthur G. Burgoyne was 
passed by the student body of the De
sign School in a meeting held Mon
day afternoon. A committee from 
each department of the school rep
resented Carnegie at the service held 
in his home on Center avenue, Wed
nesday afternoon. In memory of Mr. 
Burgoyne, the Orchestra of the 
School of Applied Design will give 
a musical program, on the afternoon 
of Sunday, March 29th, at 3:30 in the 
concert room of the Design School.
JUST A THOUGHT
To An Vditor Friend.
An impromptu thought from a bron
cho, self taught,
A tribute of friendship to you,
A rustic bouquet often wet with the 
spray
That irrigates souls. Heavens brew.
Heavens brew! God be praised for 
the trail it has blazed 
Thru the Valley of Death I have 
trod,
For the tears that we shed for the 
dying and dead 
Kept us closer to Nature and God.
And I glory today that the spring of 
the spray 
Is still irrigating my soul,
That the thorn and the sigh, and the 
tear in my eye 
Are the assets, preferred ih control.
So dear editor friend, heres a beauti
ful blend,
That you will I am sure understand,
In this simple bouquet, I am flinging 
your way,
And as free as a kiss from the hand.
Just a thoughtwith the Poet Scouts 
brand.
Your friend, in clouds or sunshine,
J. W. Crawford,
Old Jack.
