Form Revival Will Be 
Tried For Second Time
John Hackler Calls First Meeting 
For Any And All Interested
Leading the second attempt to revive Form magazine as an 
active campus publication, John Hackler, architecture sub-senior, has 
called a meeting of any and all interested for 4:30 p. m., Thurs
day, December 18 in FA 201 at the authorization of an administrationfaculty-student committee set up to deal with the problem.
Although the purpose of this first meeting is to see if it is 
practicable to revive Form, Hackler expressed his personal opinion 
of the attempt by saying: I think* 
that Form has terrific possibili
ties of becoming the Art Schools 
Technical, and of attaining the 
same high level of quality now 
enjoyed by the engineering and 
science school publication.
That the first meeting will not 
be of an organizational nature was 
emphasized strongly by Hackler.
Those who appear will be divided 
into two groups, and TyiLL under
take the study of practicability" 
before anything else is done.
One group, he explained,
will be composed of people for
merly associated with the maga
zine.
It will dig up anything possi
ble which is relative to the previ
ous organization  old copy, lay
outs, anything at all which was 
used by the other staffs.
The other group, that compos
ed of new people he continued,
Will determine the potential of 
Form. The sales, copy, general in
terest potentials of an Arts School 
magazine all will be determined.
The data which is gathered in 
the search will be presented to 
the committee, which will decide 
whether or not the effort is worth 
continuing.
The decision of the committee 
will be presented to the students 
who have made the preliminary 
investigations, and they will be 
asked to express their reactions to 
a final reactivation of the maga
zine.
If this reaction is favorable, 
said Hackler, we will then elect 
a temporary staff, set up a con
stitution, and do the actual dirty 
work of getting the first issue out.
In response to questions about 
the history of the magazine, Hack
ler attempted to piece together 
what he knew of the previous fail
ures.
I became interested in the first 
staff in the Spring of 1946 he 
began. That was when Allan 
Clark was editor and Scotty 
Yurchison was business manager.

Hackler noted that he was not 
associated with the second staff, 
which was led by Kenneth Welch 
as editor (Clark having graduated) 
with Yurchison again business 
manager.
Im not familiar enough with 
what happened to the second try 
either to make a statement con
cerning the circumstances which 
attended its collapse. I just know 
that once again Form folded.
When the subject of the third 
revival was reached, he became 
more definite in his statements.
Interest just seemed to revive

of us in the Architecture Depart
ment were talking about it, when

CIT Cagers 
Play Prexies 
Friday Night
Sporting a record of one win 
and one loss, the CIT cagers en
tertain W&J in the Skibo gym 
Friday evening, December 19.
Both teams will be out to better 
their seasons average by winning 
this game. W&J opened the sea
son by smothering St. Vincent 
college and then went on to lose 
to Penn State after giving the 
Lions a battle for the first half.
Last season the Prexies dealt 
out two defeats to Coach Donohoes charges, but this year the 
Jays are without the services of 
high scoring Hank Knoche. After 
the determined fight displayed by 
the Tartans against Westminster 
the Prexies should find stiff com

Citcom Clan Announces 
Non-Partisan Ticket
Endorses Candidates For Council 
On Personalities, "Not Parties*
Announcing that Citcom Clan is now non-partisan, the lead
ing organization of campus independents has thrown its strength 
behind a slate of nine men from the College of Engineering, six 
of them members of fraternities.
This list, compiled after a discussion of their past records 
on campus by the Clans executive board, was announced by 
Kenneth Hall, president, and John A. Ewart, vice-president, as in
cluding John Williamson, Robert ?-
J. Fulton, Ivan M. Faigen, Dale 
A. Wright, Thomas J. Hall, Lee 
Wiley, John Anderson, John K. 
OHare, and William Bourke.
Citcom choices from Fine Arts 
are Anita Nelson and Mabel Brit
tain, with Alberta Cuneo from 
MMCC completing the slate.
In explaining his flat statement 
that Citcom Clan is non-partisan, 
Hall pointed out: In the past, if a 
man was a fraternity man, Citcom 
did everything to get him.
And if he was an independent, 
they did everything they could 
to boost him. But that is what we
Tecvets Achievements Reviewed 
As Veterans9 Group Ends Career
Tecvets, which was officially dissolved last week, served as a 
material aid to veterans at Carnegie Tech for more than two years'. 
Initiated as an organization to help the veterans with all campus
problems, Tecvets closed its books when members decided that its
aims had been fulfilled and it no longer served a purpose.
The influx of veterans to the Carnegie campus in the spring 
and summer T>f 1945, said Dave Berry, one of the early members
of the group, presented a problem#-----------------------------------------------------
that the administration was pre
pared to handle. Realizing that
some action was needed to relieve 
the situation, a dozen of the vet
erans banded together to form 
Tecvets with the intention that
the organization gather the Car
negie vets into one unit to bet
ter help them solve their prob
lems.
Housing, lack of subsistence,
tutoring, and companionship were 
the major problems facing the vet
eran; Tecvets proposed to give aid 
wherever possible. Another im
portant function of the group was 
to keep all members informed of 
rules and legislation set up by 
the VA which vitally concerned 
GI students. Speakers from serv
ice organizations participated in 
most meetings.
Berry added that, Tecvets and 
the administration worked togeth
er to help the married veterans 
find suitable quarters, and the 
result was the married veterans 
housing unit, which supplies living 
quarters for twenty-four men 
with children. Tecvets assumed 
the responsibility of determining 
which veterans were most eligible 
to use the unit.
Since the organization was bas
ed on service and social life, when 
the administration gradually es
tablished offices designed to aid 
the veteran, the purpose of the 
organization had been served, and 
after an attempt by an outside 
group to revive it failed, Tecvets 
w'as dissolved.
now refer to as the old Citcom.
Our attitude today is that Cit
com is primarily a social organiza
tion whose main purpose is to pro
vide a means whereby independent 
students can become active in 
school affairs.
At this point Ewart noted: We 
dont expect our policy to have 
too much effect on the policies of 
the other organizations with re
spect to this election. But we are 
trying to convince all of the stu
dents that this is the best policy. 
When asked to define exactly 
what Citcoms policy is, Ewart re
plied promptly: Our platform 
doesnt involve political parties. It 
involves personalities.
Hall reviewed briefly Citcoms

School Gives 
Yule Gift
Last week, all students received 
their Christmas present from the 
Administration in the form of 
suspensions of classes on Friday 
afternoon and Saturday morning. 
Due to a breakdown of electrical 
equipment in the heating system, 
the heat was shut off temporarily 
and normal operation was not re
stored until Sunday afternoon.
This breakdown, besides free
ing thousands of students for a 
long week-end, caused a post

The Case Of Form
The third -attempt. to activate Form 
magazine presents a real challenge to the Fine
Arts students. ' -
'  But judging by the means being employed 
to accomplish this task, as recorded on the 
front page of the Tartan, we wonder 
whether or not this challenge will be success
fully met. t
The actual rebuilding of the organization 
is -being approached with extreme caution, and 
procedures have been established for this work 
which are almost sure to sap the enthusiasm 
of even the most eager staff members.
That there is student interest in the pro
ject ijoWious_ from the persistency of the at
tempts to revive it. That the magazine can 
be properly circulated is equally probable if 
the success with the austerely complex Car
negie Technical is enjoying can be used as 
a criterion.
<The primary problem appears to be one of 
finances. Assuming that this problem will re
main difficult for some time to come, the maga
zine can first be planned on a minimum basis, 
using relatively few cuts and restricting size 
to perhaps 28 pages. ,s
Obtaining a proper balance of advertising 
wilt not be an easy task, but we have met 
some remarkable business and advertising 
managers in the past two years. Another of 
this breed, reinforced with a direct subsidy to 
Forms account from Council, should be able 
to "break the back of this problem within a 
/ear, ..,. , < -.
The basic difficulty, then, does not lie in the 
infeasibility of Form. The trouble now ap
pearing^ lies more in the realm of the causes 
whicV contributed materially to the collapse 
of the previous staffs., - -..-r :
The reputation of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology and of its Component colleges 
will rioTt be materially reduced if the first is
sue of Form is not completely perfect. The 
magazine  will, after all, bear the imprint 
Published by the students of C.I.T., and 
student work is imperfect by definition.
But there will never be even an imperfect 
copy of Form if its staff is not permitted to 
function with at least a part of the freedom 
granted to i>ther publications. The present set
up, contrary to administration policy, places 
control of the magazine in the hands of people 
who canr smrff out its life with an invisible 
stroke of an axe which has no right to be so 
n re fully poised^
Says Who?
By Carl Klalir
Is This Really Necessary?
Its just that waysome people are lucky and 
some are not. Some accept the benefices of fortune 
with outstretched arms and others must wait long 
hours for a chary morsel. For instance, Congress
man McDowell of Wilkinsburg, now serving on 
the House Un-American Activities committee was 
unable, despite the aid of a corps of house dicks 
and FBI men, to unearth any evidence of fascistic activity in the United States. But I had better 
fortune. Neo-fascists in America are so anxious, 
it seems, to find a responsive audience that if you 
are broke you can receive all their publications 
for free; naturally I was eligible, so today finds 
me sporting a copy of the latest American Com
mentator.
The American Commentator, a weekly cesspool 
on foolscap, is allegedly published in Denver, Col
orado by an alleged Stephen Nenoff character. 
This is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-labor, 
anti-Wall Street, and anti-fast driving and for 
Sen. Robert Taft and J. Parnell Thomas. It ex
ploits what it calls old-fashioned religion and 
homegrown Americanism obviously designed for 
the rural and urban varieties of hick. Its opinions 
are so original as to deserve the systematic expo
sition you see below.
On people who have contributed to Commun
ism in America: Lenin, Stalin, F. D. Roosevelt, 
Winston Churchill, Howard Hughes, John L. Lewis, 
Edward Stettinius.
On the peoples choice:
Robert H. Taft, for asserting that a Nurenberg 
trial was un-American. (The Republican party 
disavowed him for that one.)
On young people:
Young people are alike these days in many disre
spects.  t
On people who criticize the American Com
mentator: The FBI will take care of such individu
als and root these psychopaths out.
On the Marshall plan:
The Marshall plan, like UNRRA, is (a communist 
plot) designed to get into the hands of the Soviets, 
as it did in Bulgaria, Rumania, and Poland, the 
money and products of America.
On the future:
In six months the Marshall plan will be an obvious 
failure. There are so many Russian lovers and FDR 
stooges, so many Me-Too boys such as Eisenhower

Letter to the Editor
A Free Campus?
Editor, The Tartan
According to the Tartan, at the last meeting 
of the Student Council, the president of said or
ganization closed a five minute discussion concern
ing the National Student association with the 
statement that NSA is Nothing but a student union 
to encourage student government on campuses 
domineered by their administrations. He then con
tinued, We here at Carnegie have no such prob
lem.
Can Mr. Marshall be joking? I dare say that 
he is wishfully thinking and cant see the trees 
for the forest. If Tech is not domineered what does 
the term imply? It is the experience of any trans
fer to be startled into the realization of just what 
dictatorial powers are exercised here.
Is it not dictatorial when one man can over
rule an entire student bodys wishes? Is it not dic
tatorial when one man, and not the students, must 
be catered to by the very organization whose func
tion it is to express the students wants? Is it not 
dictatorial when opposition to this one man is 
put down by FEAR of expulsion? A
If any one student at random were stopped 
on campus and asked if he did not think it were 
true that Tech could have a good football team but 
for the wishes of one man, the answer would be 
speedily forthcoming in the affirmative. The poll 
need not end there, for a questioning of the en
tire campus would reveal that a majority of the 
student body feels that their desires of having 
a worthy team are being suppressed by one man.
Not only is the situation distasteful to the student 
body because of its very nature but the existence 
of applauding hypocrites who support this Machia
vellian method of student control, such as Mr. 
Marshall, festers the sore and further infects oth
erwise healthy college government.
These very hypocrites are now cringing at the 
thought of the NSA gaining the upper hand and 
installing its liberal college ideas. If ever there 
existed a need for such an organization it is here. 
But we, the students of Tech, will not have it 
unless we strongly insist upon such action through 
our student council.
GERALD C. MEYERS, Mgt. Jr.
On Stage
By Marty Dorff
The drama departments sec
ond effort of the season is a fine 
production of Maxwell Andersons 
The Wingless Victory. The play 
itself is highly engrossing and re-^ 
ceiVes a performance worthy of it.
The pace at which it moves, 
particularly in the first act, is es
pecially good. The play opens 
with a very effective scene, con
vincingly projected, and from 
then on there is no flagging of 
interest despite the great length 
of the act. The suspense element 
is well-achieved; so much so that 
just before Oparres entry the 
audience literally seems to stop 
breathing. The remaining two acts 
also appear to move rapidly even 
though they, too, are rather long.
Several scenes are memorable 
the very first one, where Mrs. McQuiston draws herself slowly up 
and shocks the audience out of 
its seat by spitting in the face of 
an unfortunate young girl, that 
terrible scene at the end of the 
second act where Oparrfe is fin
ally made to realize the infamy 
of her husband, and the third act 
sequence in which Oparre alter
nates rapidly between fits of in
sanity and lucidity, finally arriv
ing at an anguished decision to 
kill her children and herself.
In the taxing role of Oparre, 
Nancy Wickwire and Judy Lam
bert are largely responsible for 
the plays success. The former has 
the advantage of a majestic and 
queenly bearing, so that the role 
of a princess suits her eminently 
well. Her big scene in the second 
act was full of despair and heart
break, yet there was something
of dignified reserve at the back 
of her anger. Judy Lambert plays 
this scene with a more abandoned 
rage, somewhat in the manner of 
a Greek fury. Both are highly 
successful in the part.
Ruth Guberman is superb as the 
unbending, domineering mother. 
Bitterness, hatred, and venom drip 
from her every line. In addition, 
her voice is perfectly suited to 
the part. Roger Braun is equally 
convincing as a fanatical bigot, 
the lineal descendent of the witchburning minsters of Salem. The 
part of Nathaniel McQueston, in 
some ways the most difficult to 
make credible because of the va
cillating and inconsistent nature 
of the man is realized satisfac
torily by neither James Harkey 
nor George Wood. The former 
handles the lines well, but the 
stiffness of his posture and move
ment are a handicap. The latter 
tends to bluster too much in a 
part that is evidently not his 
style.
Several of the subsidiary parts 
also deserve recognition: Edwin 
Gifford as the embarrassed sailor 
and Iris Rose, who managed to 
contribute a touch of the exotic 
to the small role of the nurse. Be
cause of the mixed casts, I was 
unable to see a number of the 
actors.
The mood of the play is success
fully captured by acting and scen
ery. It consists in a pervasion by 
the sanctimonious and stifling at
mosphere of Puritan Massachus
etts, which finally manages to 
crush the Oriental flower trans
planted to it.

Film Arts Club 
Will Present 
Old Movies
The Great Train Robbery and 
Sarah Bernhardt in Queen Eliza
beth share top billing in the Film 
Arts clubs first program of fam
ous films of the past, to be pre
sented Wednesday evening at 8:00 
p. m. in IH 104.
The program is the first of a 
series made available by the Mu
seum of Modern Art, portraying 
the development of the narrative 
motion picture, and includes sev
en masterpieces of early motion 
picture art. If sufficient interest 
is shown by the student body, the 
club plans to make the exhibition 
of such films one of its regular 
activities.
Bernhardts film is best re
membered as one of the few in 
which the star takes a curtain call 
at the end of the picture. The 
Great Train Robbery, one of the 
first of the western films, was 
also the first film to have an ac
tual plot. Possibilities 'of War 
in the Air, made in London in 
1910, sheds an interesting light on 
aeronautical folklore of the peri
od. Other films in the program 
are Wash Day Troubles, A 
Trip to the Moon/ Rescued by 
Rover, and The Execution of 
Mary Queen of Scots, a grue
some little film made in 1895.
The entire program lasts about 
an hour and a half. Tickets will 
be available in Skibo and in the 
basement of Fine Arts during the 
lunch hours on Tuesday and Wed
nesday. An admission charge of 
25 cents is being made to defray 
the cost of the film.
Bulletin Boards
The following are the official 
regulations for bulletin boards:
All bulletin boards, except 
those in Skibo, are under S. P. 
and W. control.
No notice may be placed on 
these boards without approval 
from Dr. Miners office.
Designated students will in
spect the boards daily, putting 
up approved posters and re
moving old or unauthorized 
ones.

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1947
Westminster Beats CIT 
In Hard Fought Game
Temporary Collapse Of Defense; 
Poor Team Play Defeats Carnegie
In a hotly contested game, Car
negie Tech bowed to Westminster, 
55-45, before a crowd of 1700 in 
the Skibo gym on Saturday, De
cember 12. The decision was in 
doubt until the final two minutes 
of play as the Tartans never say 
die spirit kept the crowd on the 
etfge of their seats for the greater 
part of the game.
'When the pressure was on, the 
Carnegie hoopsters beat them
selves with their poor team play. 
Consistently, after they had drawn 
abreast of the Titans in the scor
ing parade, their defense would 
temporarily collapse. Some bad 
breaks on their shots and the in
ability to score from the foul 
line kept the Plaid from posting 
an upset over their taller and 
niore experienced opponents.
A couple of decisions made by 
ofllcials Joe Zerilla and Leo Car
re aroused Coach Bill Donohoes 
wrath so much that he became 
the victim of a technical foul 
called by Carroll. The arbitrars 
handed out a total of 50 fouls, 
with the Tartans drawing 24 of 
them.
Carnegies hopes were dealt a 
severe blow when Mike Theodore 
was forced out of the game mid
way through the third quarter 
with five personal fouls. Theodore 
did a yeomans job in guarding 
Dfembinski in the first half as he 
held the Titan ace to a lone field 
goal during the first twenty min
utes of play. Tasso Katselas was 
also banished from the floor on 
fouls in the waning minutes of 
the game.
Dave Ellies played a stellar 
floor game and steadied the Skibo 
attack as they spurted into the 
lead in the second quarter.
The first few shots the Plaid 
floormen took rolled off the rim 
be'fore Theodore meshed the nets 
with a one handed push shot from 
the side. Westminster followed 
with a ten point scoring spree as 
a result of some accurate shooting 
from the foul line. In the second
Frosh Team 
Takes Place of 
Junior Varsity
Junior varsity basketball of the 
war years, has gone and a com
pletely new freshman team has 
taken its place.
During the past two weeks 
Coaches Donohoe and Cratsley 
have been supervising the action 
of some thirty candidates for the 
plebe squad. After much drilling 
and screening the squad has been 
cut to the workable size of 12 
players.
The freshman team plan set up 
by Coach Donohoe is two-fold in 
its purpose. The primary purpose 
is to teach promising freshmen 
the style of play utilized by the 
Tartans.
The second purpose of the plan 
is to keep the players in condi
tion during their first year and to 
develop their skills in the interim. 
Present plans call for the setting 
of the precedent that any candi
date for the varsity in future 
years must have tried out for the 
freshmen team when he was elig
ible.
The plebe squad will gain much 
of its experience from actual com
petition. They will appear in pre
liminary contests before all home 
games and may play in some out 
of town games. The freshmen got 
off to a flying start by beating the 
TXs in a rough and tumble bat
tle by a 49 to 35 score.
The second encounter pitted 
them against the Sigma Nus in 
a battle which Cratsleys boys 
took by a 55 to 25 count.
quarter, with Ellies showing the 
way, Carnegie held Westminster 
scoreless and rallied to grab a 
14-12 lead. The lead changed 
hands twice before the Titans fin
ally went ahead to stay. The half 
ended with Carnegie on the short 
end of a 24-21 score.
The third quarter was all West
minster as they drove to a 39-31 
lead with Heddleston and Dembinski leading the way. Without 
the services of Theodore and, soon 
after, Katselas, the Tartans strove 
vainly to close the gap, but all in 
vain. They did manage to draw 
within six points just before the 
three minute mark as they scored 
eleven points while holding West
minster to three.
The last minute saw the Skibos 
desperately trying to force the 
ball from Westminsters posses
sion. The Titans took advantage 
of the resulting foul shots to ex
tend their lead to ten points; Car
negie refused three foul throws 
in order to gain out of bounds 
possession of the ball but were 
unable to get it through the hoop.

New Intramural Sports Season 
Has Multitude Of Activities
The intramural sports picture was red hot for the second con
secutive week as bowling and volleyball were in the limelight. The 
volleyball season moved into its playoff weeks while the bowling 
meet produced some stiff competition.
After last weeks roaring start, action settled down to a gallop 
in intramural bowling. Last weeks leaders strengthened their leads 
with Delta Upsilon and Beta Theta Pi undefeated in the Strike 
league while Theta Xi has an un-^
blemished record in the Spare 
league.
Reich of Sigma Nu No. 1 had 
the high individual game of the 
day, 212, bringing his average up 
to 180.8, the best individual aver
age for two weeks play.
Sigma Nu No. 1 took further 
honors with the high team score 
of 836. The resulting average of 
797.8 pins per game leads both 
leagues.
In the Strike league all of the 
matches were taken in clean 
sweeps as Citcom won from ATO, 
DU from Kappa Sigma, Beta Theta 
Pi from Dorm Combine, and Sig
ma Nu No. 1 from Phi Kappa.
In the Spare league Theta Xi 
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon took 
three games from Tau Delta Phi 
and Sigma Nu No. 2, respectively. 
Beta Sigma Rho won two games 
of three against the Unknowns 
while Delta Tau Delta No. 1 did 
the same against Split-Emanon.
Moses of the Tau Delts bowled 
a 211 game, and his teammate, 
Lieberman, turned in a 205, but 
this was not enough to turn back 
the league leading TXs.
The hot competition in the vol
leyball leagues wound up last 
week with Emanon, Theta Xi, and 
SAE perched atop their respective 
eagues. A round robin playoff 
to decide the all-school cham
pionship began this week.
Competition in the Tartan 
League was especially keen. The 
final standings were not deter
mined until the last game when 
SAE defeated Tau Delta Phi-A to 
prevent a three-way deadlock for 
first place. Earlier the SAE team 
had edged out the DTDs in a hard 
fought match, the third and de
ciding game being clinched by a 
21-19 score.
Emanon, leader in the Kiltie 
League with six straight victories, 
was scheduled to meet the Theta 
Xis Monday night. The TXs, 
champions of the Scot League, 
sported a similar record over the 
seasons play. The SAEs, unde
feated champions of the Tartan 
league, meet Emanon Tuesday 
evening, December 16.

Carnegie Techs 1947 hoopsters swamped Grove City, 54- 
39, to the delight of the large number of students who attended 
the seasons opener Wednesday evening, December 10.
Coach Bill Donohoe was wearing his old victory smile after 
his cagers broke away to a large halftime advantage and then 
coasted Lea to the win.
Outstanding in the fracas was center Mike Theodore whose 
brilliant play at the pivot post#------------------------------------------------------
netted him the games high scor
ing honors with 20 points.
The Tartans were never head
ed after little Marty Chetlins 
opening basket. Their defense 
proved so baffling to Grove City 
that the Grovers scored only one 
field goal in the first half. Halftime found the Tartans on the 
long end of a 28-7 score.
In the second half, Grove City 
found the answer in Bish, their 
lanky pivot man. He proved un
canny on his pivot shots and dish
ed out a couple of hooks that had 
even the referee looking twice.
However, Theodores consist
ency, together with some timely 
two-pointers by Jack Riehl and 
Tasso Katselas, kept Wild Bill 
Donohoe from losing the rest of 
his hair. Very encouraging was 
freshman Bob McCulloughs de
but. A dead-eye anywhere near 
the foul line, he clicked on four 
out of seven attempts in the short 
time he played.
Both teams had difficulty find
ing the basket in the first quar
ter. Although CIT held a 9-3 ad
vantage, they actually were only 
able to garner two field goals. In 
the second quarter, led by The
odore, the Skibos got hot both 
offensively and defensively. The
odore racked up nine points as he 
and his mates held the Grovers 
scoreless from the floor.
The third quarter found Grove 
City, led by Bish, outscoring CIT 
15-10. The final quarter was an 
even exchange of baskets with the 
opposition getting an extra foul 
shot on their side of the score 
sheet.

G RE Y HO UNWestern Etectric
A UNIT OF THE BELLSYSTEM SINCE 1882
Pete Cregut
The 1947 edition of the Car
negie hoopsters has turned out to 
be quite a surprise.
After winning the opener from
a very weak Grove City quintet,
the Tartans gave 
notice that they 
werent going to 
restrict them
selves to beating 
the weak sisters
as they battled
what has been 
heralded as the 
best Westminster 
team in many 
years right down 
to the last whis
tle.
The ten point 
difference at the 
end of the game might have been 
much less had it not been for 
some weird officiating. Probably 
everyone that saw the game is 
still wondering how referee A1 
Zarilla found a reason to call 
the fifth foul on Mike Theodore. 
Mike was having an off night of
fensively, but even aside from his 
scoring ability Mikes presence on 
the floor is invaluable. After The
odore had departed the Tartans 
could do little more than hold 
their own.
That was the first time that 
Mike had ever been kicked out of 
a ball game on personal fouls and 
behind the incident is quite a 
story. Zarilla and Theodore had 
been in the Army together and 
both had played on the same Ar
my team at New Cumberland. The 
team was pretty good and A1 and 
Mike went through the season 
fighting for the scoring leadership 
of the team. There had never 
been any love lost between the 
two and when Mike finally beat 
out Zarilla for the total points 
championship, that just about 
ended the friendship. Mike swears 
that this had no bearing on his 
untimely departure Saturday 
night, an^i probably he is right, 
but it will be interesting to see 
what happens the next time ZarilUNIVERSITY RECREATION
la has the opportunity to work a 
Carnegie game.
Some of the statistics on the 
first two games are worth men
tioning at this time. They illus
trate how different Saturday 
nights game against Westmin
ster might have been had the 
Tartan shooting been as accurate 
as it was against Grove City. 
While Carnegie won the Grove 
City game on foul shooting, they 
lost the Westminster game in the 
same way. Against the Grovers 
they converted 12 of 17 freethrows while the visitors could 
do no better than 11 of 27. In the 
game with the Titans Saturday 
night the situation was reversed 
as the Skibos could convert only 
13 of 32 while Westminster made 
15 of 28.
Carnegies shooting average for 
the two games is even more re
vealing. Against the Grovers the 
Tartans made 21 of 65 field shots 
good for an average of 32.4% but 
against the Titans they dropped 
to a new low of 19.7% as they 
converted only 16 of 81. If the 
Skibos could have sustained their 
shooting average of last Wednes
day night they would have con
verted 26 shots and that in addi
tion to the 13 fouls would have 
given them the game by a score 
of 65-55.
If the shooting average set in 
the Grove City game can be 
maintained, these Tartans will 
have to be reckoned with.
Mike Theodore
Varsity Club
There will be an important 
meeting of the Varsity club in 
the Black Cat lounge of Thistle 
hall on Wednesday afternoon, 
December 17, at 4:30 p.m.
During the past semester the 
question, Who can join the 
Varsity club? has often been 
asked. The club is open to 
membership to any male stu
dent who has received a letter 
in a varsity sport at Carnegie 
Tech. At present the club has 
about 45 active members rep
resenting all of the school 
sports.
captain 6f the Tartan basketball team came as no surprise to close 
followers of the Carnegie sports scene. Coach Donohoes selection 
was especially popular with the team, all of whom highly respect 
Mikes ability.
This year marks Mikes third season in the uniform of the
Plaid. He first was a candidate for the team as a freshman in the
1944-45 season and won the first ?---------------------------------------------------
string center post before leaving 
for the Army. Mike returned in 
the middle of the 1946-47 season to 
again take over at the starting 
pivot post.
Burly Mike is a veritable ironman on the basketball court, us
ually playing the greater part of 
the game. He has the stamina and 
drive to move his 192 pounds up 
and down the floor with apparent 
tirelessness. His height, 6 2, gives 
Mike an advantage which he 
uses well to control the ball under 
the basket, even against such 
players as lanky Chet Dembinski 
from Westminster.
Mike is a dead eye shot on the 
pivot. On such shots he has al
most a 50-50 chance of scoring. 
Some indication of his scoring abil
ities can be obtained from the fact
that he scored 134 points in 9 
games in 1944-45 and the same 
amount last year in 11 games. This 
year he has a total of 29 points 
in 2 games showing that there 
are no signs of decrease in his 
point making.
Although scoring is important, 
his biggest contribution to the 
team is his ability to steady the 
play and sense when things are 
not working as well as they should 
be. In a quick time out period he 
can usually remedy the situation.
Theodore played his high school 
basketball at Wilmerding where 
he was also an outstanding end 
on the football team. During his 
time in the Army Mike was high 
scorer with the post team at New 
Cumberland and starred with his 
group team while on duty in the 
Philippines.

differentiation of the various 
personalities, explaining that 
the Executive board had discussed 
the activities of all of the candi
dates, "and in general what kind 
of a person they are at a meeting 
held late Thursday afternoon, and 
had made its decisions on this 
basis.
In detailing Citcoms hopes for 
the future, Hall outlined a double
envelopment program with which 
the Clan hoped to convince the 
campus of the correctness of its 
non-partisan stand and cause a 
general adoption of this policy.
We realize that this election is' 
more or less of an experiment. 
But we hope that the showing 
which our candidates make, if 
elected, will convince the rest of 
the school that we have a wise 
policy.
We have 200 members righi 
now and think that we have a fast 
growing organization.
Within the next three semes
ters, we hope to have five or six 
times that number. If we reach 
that goal, our strength will then 
play a decisive part in the elec
tions.
But, he emphasized, our pres
ent policy will remain the same."
Hall and Ewart both agreed that 
the present Student Council had 
given Citcom very fair and im
partial consideration, contrary to 
the expectations of many of the 
organizations members.
They used this situation as an 
illustration of their point that 
Student Council exists primarily 
to carry on the administrative af
fairs of the students, and that 
there is no value in having mem
bers of Council representing in
dividual organizations.
The interests of these organ
izations are best served, they 
said, by having a Council whose 
members are broadminded and at 
the same time have the ability to 
handle the affairs of the students 
capably.
The people Citcom has chosen, 
they concluded, are the best 
among those running on the basis 
of these qualifications.

Traditional Carols 
To Celebrate Xmas
Each year the Christmas season is ushered in by the singing 
of Christmas carols and hymns, and we hear again the familiar and 
ever beautiful songs of Christmas, in celebration of Christs birth.
An ancient and lovely custom is the singing of these joyous
hymns of praise, and it harkens back to the days of old when carols 
were sung in the streets by waifs and minstrels, when the Yule 
log burned on the hearth, holly and mistletoe gleamed among the 
Christmas candles and wassail^- 
sounds made glad the festive 
Christmastide.
Diez suggests that the word 
carols derived from chorus.
Others ally it with corolla, a gar
land, circle or coronet, the ear
liest sense of the word being ap
parently a ring or circle, a 
ring dance. The crib set up in 
the churches at Christmas was 
the enter of a dance, and some 
of the most famous of Latin 
Christmas hymns were written to 
dance tunes. These songs were 
called Wiegenlieder in German, 
noels in French, and carols in 
English.
We like to think that the first 
carol ever sung was by the angel 
chorus on that first Christmas 
eve, nearly two thousand years 
ago. But, it was not until the 
thirteenth century that we find 
the beginning of the true Christ
mas carol and Italy is its birth
place. From Italy, the carol spread 
to Spain, France, England and 
other European countries where 
it retained its folk-song qualities 
of legendary lore and childlike 
simplicity with a strange mingling 
of reverence and genial mirthful
ness. The earliest printed collec
tion of carols was issued by Wynkyn de Worde in 1521.
The beginning of the eight
eenth century marks the transi
tion from the true carol to the 
more dignified and solemn ChristChristmas Program 
Planned By Council
O come all ye faithful! Get ye the Spirit of Christmas. Come to 
the Little Theatre on Friday evening, December 19, at 9:30 p.m.
Evening student council has planned a Christmas program the 
first of its kind to be held for evening students. The program will
-----------------------------------------------------?have a dual purpose, to acquaint
the students with the activities of 
the Evening School and to cele
brate the Yuletide Season. Many 
students have little or no knowl
edge concerning the activities 
held on campus for them. This 
will give them an opportunity to 
meet their council officers and 
their fellow students. Students 
may make suggestions at this gettogether for any function which 
they would like to have initiated.
The Fine Arts building will be 
decked with wreaths and holly; 
Reverend Scharfe will officiate at 
the Convocation; and Techs fam
ous Glee Club will be on hand to 
sing your favorite Christmas car
ols. The beautiful voices of the 
Glee Club make old Scrooge him
self hum along with them.
All classes will be dismissed at 
9:20 p.m. in order that students 
may attend.

mas hymn. Among 18th century 
religious carols perhaps the most 
famous is Charles Weseys Hark, 
How All the Welkin Rings. The 
nineteenth century brought the 
beautiful Silent Night, Holy 
Night and also O Little Town of

Christmas eve spent by him in

The modern revival of carolsinging has produced new carols, 
the best of which are perhaps de
rived mostly from medieval Latin 
Christmas hymns.
Poem
Twas the night before Christmas 
And all through the school 
Not a creature was stirring 
Not even a fool
The books were all stacked in the 
lockers with care 
In hopes that Santa Claus would 
soon be there 
In each students place, a note 
was inscribed 
In hopes that Saint Nicholas 
wouldnt put them aside 
They asked for some As and an 
assortment of Bs 
And ended with thank you, and 
wont you please.
Writ by hand  A1 Snowden
Well, here we go again . . .
We just got vack from a Xmas
trip--------trees Im referring to 
for use in the Carnegie Union as 
decorations to help stir up some 
holiday spirit around the campus.
All you people who slighted the 
last dance missed some exciting 
events. The highlight of the eve
ning was a Hokey Pokey dance. 
About twenty couples participat
ed in the dance, which could easi
ly have been substituted for calis 
thenics or fifteen minutes of army 
drill. Then if you felt that you 
could afford to lose more weight 
the Too Fat Polka was very 
helpful.
Charlene Tohey had a little dif
ficulty in Psychology the other 
night when she was attacked with 
a severe case of hicups. I won
der if she ever tried sticking her 
fingers in her ears and taking a 
long drink of water at the same 
time? It always helped me.
Mike Krene is after a new part
ner or a new manual in physics 
lab. He is tired of having every 
experiment result a flop.
Dr. Klee has been having a lit 
tie more success in teaching his 
class this year since blondes, bru 
nettes and redheads are missing 
from the front row in his class
Did you hear those sighs of re 
lief rising from these immortal 
halls? Schools closed. We hear 
some illustrious student threw 
wrench in the works.
Plaid Likes 
Student Play
It has been a long time since 
the faithful who flock monthly to 
the Little Theater have been re
warded with a production as fine 
as Maxwell Andersons Wingless 
Victory. Once more the drama 
students, under the direction of 
Mary Morris, have proven them
selves able to handle better plays 
than they have been given lately.
We found both casts to be ex
cellent which seems to prove that 
the Dramats do better work in a 
vehicle which they believe to be 
good. Particularly creditable were 
those performances by Roger 
Brann as Phineas McQueston, Fe
lice Orlandi as Judge Urquhart, 
Elek Hartman as Ruel McQues
ton, and George Wood as Captain 
Nathaniel. A delightful scene 
stealer was seen in the person of 
Pamela Gordon, a ten-year old 
veteran of the Childrens Theater 
as Durian.
Our orchid of the month goes 
to Judy Lambert for her very fine 
portrayal of Oparre. Miss Lam
bert was able to bring out the 
deep emotion of this role with the 
ease and naturalness of a true 
first-lady of the theater.
