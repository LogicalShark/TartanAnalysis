FACULTY SENIOR BASE BALL GAME
“What are the bugles blowin’ for?” said Piles on 
Parade.
“The Seniors hung it on the Faculty,” the Color 
Sergeant said.
Yea Bo, it is even so, and it came about thusly with 
the lineup as follows:
Faculty Seniors
Reed................................Left Field............................. Beeken
Sill........................................Catcher....................................Mason
Lightner...............................Third................................ Schultz
Keller............................Center Field............................Hobbs
Lightcap.......................Right Field........................Crawford
Crabtree .............................Second.............................. Charles
Dosey.....................................First......................................Archer
Leete....................................Pitcher.............................. Coldren
Estep ..............•..............Short Stop............................... Light
Dr. Watson L. Savage, umpire.
The game opened with the Faculty at the bat. Reed 
started the good work with a little hit which was re­
turned to first shortly before Percy got there. Sill 
also hit and was put out at first. Lightner, having 
the proper spirit stuck his foot out and let Coldren 
hit him; A. Le Roy went to first when he recovered 
and sniped second, getting better there, he ambled 
to third on Keller’s hit and tycobbed home. The 
Astrologer hiked to second and watched Lightcap 
fan out.
Now pinch hitter Charles let out a bingle, reached 
first, tried to purloin second and got bit. Mason hit 
to Lightner, stole second and came in on Coldren’s 
drive. Peaches was advanced to third by Light, who 
was sniped off at first by Dean Leete. Score 1-1.
Coldren put the Indian sign on Crabtree, who 
/anned. The charm refused to work on Dosey who 
hit for two bags, appropriated third and came home.
Estep and Leete fell victims to the aboriginal insignia 
and also fanned.
Schultz hit to Crabtree, reached first, paraded to 
second, galloped to third, and romped home. Archer, 
Beeken and Hobbs went down before Leete’s famous 
cut ball. Score 2-2.
In the third inning Reed hit to Light who fumbled. 
Then the Surveyor stole second, while Chemical Sill 
fanned. Lightner sacrificed and brought Reed to 
third. Keller hit a put out to Light. Crawford hit a 
long drive to Reed, who muffed. The Senior ambled 
around for two bases and was put out at third. 
Charles and Mason, the Mutt, couldn’t find the ball. 
Score 2-2.
In the fourth Coldren put the bug on Lightcap. 
Crabtree unlimbered and put a flynn over on the 
rocks, got started for second, shot in the reverse, and 
failed to recover. Dosey hit the air three times.
Coldren started the fifth by fanning Architectural 
it with one wing. Light couldn’t see the ball and 
fanned. Schultz hit to Leete and was put out at 
first. Score 2-2.
Coldren started the fifth by fanning Architectural 
Estep. The Dean hit to Crawford who fumbled. 
Tanger ran for Leete and stole second. Reed sacri­
ficed and advanced Tanger to third. Coldren made a 
flying tackle and bagged Sill on his way to first. The 
Dean put three of them over on Archer, who retired. 
Beeken hit to Reed and Hobbs fanned. Score 2-2.
Peaches put the reverse English on the ball for 
Lightner and he couldn’t hit. Keller came to the bat 
and hit out to Cocoanut Hobbs, who muffed. Lightner 
ran for the Grand Old Man and stole second. Tanger 
couldn’t connect and Honus Crabtree hit to Light. 
Crawford bingled to Tanger who fumbled. Charles

fanned. Mason hit a high one to Dosey. Coldren hit 
into right field, advancing Crawford to third and him­
self to second. Leete joined in the festivities and 
endeavored to sand bag Peaches on second. Craw­
ford took the hint and came home. Leete flunked 
Light. Score 3-2.
In the last inning Dosey fanned. Peaches gave 
Estep four balls. Leete hit to Hobbs, who fumbled, 
advancing Estep to second. Tanger ran for the 
Dean. Reed hit to Crawford, who fell but caught 
the ball. Estep and Tanger moved up one each. 
Estep came in on a passed ball. Sill hit a small one 
and brought in Tanger. Lightner sacrificed Sill to 
second.
Schultz hit a grounder which ricocheted through 
Leete and Crabtree and was finally rounded up by 
Keller. In the interval Schultz had stolen second and 
was brought home by Beeken. Score 5-4.
COMMENCEMENT DAY SPEAKER.
The Commencement Speaker for the Carnegie 
Technical Schools on June 15th, at the Carnegie 
Music Hall will be Dr. William S. Rainsford, formerly 
rector of St. George’s Church, of New York City.
Dr. Rainsford was born in Ireland, educated in St. 
John College, Cambridge, from which he graduated in 
1872, and has lived for the past twenty-five years in 
America, being called to his work in New York in 
1883.
Some few years ago Dr. Rainsford was compelled 
to give up his work owing to ill-health and has been, 
during the past few years, in Africa and Continental 
Europe. Dr. Rainsford’s reputation is international;
he is the father of what is known as the institutional 
church in America, which endeavors to make it pos­
sible for city churches to become strong socialogical 
influences in the parish of which they are a part.
Dr. Rainsford’s African trip was planned with 
Theodore Roosevelt. His experiences on the Dark 
Continent are to be found in his recent book, “The 
Land of the Lion,” which is an account of his own 
observations. Many graphic descriptions are given 
of his encounters with the king of beasts.
Said the editor of a well known magazine in writ­
ing of the man and his work recently:
“Twenty years ago there was a dying church in the 
East Side of New York. Families that had lived in 
the vicinity were moving away. Their houses were 
being transformed into flats. The incoming popula­
tion was, to all appearances indifferent to what the 
church had to offer. The emptying houses were be­
ing filled with more people than they contained before. 
The emptying church became each year emptier and 
emptier. The church was offered for sale. Nobody 
would buy it.
“Today that church is one of the greatest powers 
for good in that great city. Its services are thronged. 
Working men and women sit and kneel beside people 
of wealth and power. A Parish House joined to it 
affords recreation for those who have no other places 
of recreation than the saloons, the dance halls, and 
the street, as well as those who choose to go there 
from homes of refinement for the social life it af­
fords. A trade school is maintained by the church 
to supply' industrial training for the boys of the 
parish. Active organizations thrive—religious be­
cause administering to needs that are fundamentally 
human. The church which two decades ago was it­
self in the grasp of death, is today living in that com­
munity that the community itself may have life and 
have it more abundantly.
Humanely speaking, this change has been wrought 
by one man. In 1882 he was acting as rector of St. 
James’ Cathedral Church, Toronto, Canada. When 
he was called to this despondent church in New York, 
he went with a clear idea of what a city parish ought 
to be and what ends it ought to serve. That idea, 
by persistent, active, courageous faith, he has trans­
lated into a living, visible reality. That man is Dr. 
W. S. Rainsford, and his achievement is the great 
parish of St. George’s.”
Dr. Rainsford is a brilliant speaker and a man of 
commanding presence, whose address will be filled 
with inspiration for the graduates.
For nearly a dozen years Director Hamerschlag 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools was associated 
with Dr. Rainsford in his work on the East Side of 
New York City.
SPECIAL NOTICE.
Secretary Field suggests that every Alumnus who 
visits the schools during Commencement week, re­
port at his office and register; that is, give his Pitts­
burgh address, and length of time he expects to be 
in the city. This record will be of value to all 
Alumni.

IVY ORATION.
By Sara Grant Williams, Class of 1910,
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women. 
My Classmates:
Two lives are about to start along another course 
— the life of the class of 1910, and the life of this 
little ivy vine, which will remain as the surviving 
symbol of our class. As it grows and clings to the 
building in its upward struggle, so will the members 
of the class stand by the school after they have leit 
it.
Until today this was a little hot-house plant, pro­
tected from the rough weather, and watched over by 
the faithful gardener. Now it is to be put out of 
doors, unprotected, to struggle for itself, to survive 
the hardships of the winter only to be able to take a 
firmer grasp on life when the fair weather comes.
Like this little plant, we, too, have been shielded 
from the rough winds of the world by our parents, 
and — as the hardener has watched, cultivated and 
developed this plan, so our teachers have cultivated 
our minds and deevloped our bodies, and prepared 
us for the future, which from now on will be of our 
own making.
And now we are to face the world alone, thrown 
entirely on our own responsibility, and to go on de­
veloping and enlarging our possibilities, and passing
on to those who follow the riches garnered here, 
and like the little plant which is ever striving upward 
and welcoming every sunbeam, so should we strive, 
and welcome every opportunity.
The world has thrown open its gates to welcome 
us, and as we look out, the path ahead appears bright 
and beautiful. It seems impossible there can be 
stumbling blocks on such a beautiful, sunny road. 
Around each bend lies ever our hope, the unforseen 
holds out possibilities which fire our ambition, and 
we look for the best. But if any find the road rough 
they will appreciate the smooth places much more 
when they come to them, and by overcoming the dif­
ficulties gain fortitude.
We shall all go through the gate together, but after 
we have gone a short distance the road will divide 
and we shall branch out along the different paths of 
life. Perhaps a few will probably stay closer together 
than others. We shall never get entirely away from 
one another, for just as you can trace each tendril 
of the vine back to the parent stalk — so will you be 
able to trace each one of us back to the one binding 
spirit — our school.
The alumnae will hold us together and will keep 
our paths from getting too widely separated. There 
will be room for the new vine planted each year, and 
the walls of the building be made more beautiful by 
the addition. So will the alumnae be improved each 
year by the class which they take in.
At first each plant will stand out distinctly, but as 
the vines planted by the different classes grow and 
spread they will intertwine, finally covering the whole 
building, so you will not be able to distinguish one 
plant from another — the stronger plant protecting 
and supporting the weak. So will the classes after 
they have left the school go to form the alumni, and 
the alumni as a body will shower its honors on the 
school. And as the ivy vines spread and add beauty 
to the building, so do we aim to help improve the 
world by our acts and our deeds.
These vines have only the walls of the building to 
work upon and improve, but we are not so limited — 
we have the whole world in which to work and do 
good. Our influence may not be great, but each 
seed planted righly will bring forth its fruit, and if 
our work stands we can feel that we have accom­
plished something. We certainly get encouragement 
from Longfellow in his Psalm of Life, in which he 
says
“Lives of great men all remind us 
We can make our lives sublime,
And departing leave behind us 
Foot-prints on the sands of time.”
Just one year ago the class of 1909 planted their 
vine on the other side of the building. It has taken 
hold and made a very brave start in life, just as the 
class it represents has done. The girl? have passed 
through the gate and have cheerfully wended their 
way along their separate paths. Some have found 
the road they selected smooth and they have made 
better progress than others. Those who have been

---------------------------------------------------

6THE TARTAN
successful have already reached the first bend, and 
have found the road ahead as bright with anticipa­
tions as that which they have passed over. We hope 
as the other members of the class catch up they 
will find their path just as pleasant. As their vine 
has begun to attract attention, so have these girls 
begun to make thfcir work felt.
All the good which this school has instilled into 
the Class of 1909 is beginning to be marked. Each 
pupil has profited in her own way, and is branching 
out accoringly — no two in the same direction. 
Through them the old proverb “As a man soweth, he 
reapeth” has again been fulfilled. The school has 
already gained by the good work done by the class 
sent out.
And Juniors and Plebes, we hope you will profit by 
this and give the school an opportunity to sow even 
better seeds, than those which were planted in the 
preceding class. The first years were experimental, 
but they reaped good harvests, and the Faculty has 
found which seeds are more prolific, through their 
experience with the class which has gone. They will 
know what seeds to plant in future classes, and you 
will profit by their experience. But it requires more 
than fertile soil and good seeds to produce good re­
sults. The seeds must have care and attention to 
bring forth strong, healthy plants. And if you desire 
to be come a strong class you must start now to 
cultivate the seeds.
And now classmates since the world has thrown 
open its gates, we should go out into it and demon­
strate to the Faculty that we have made good use of 
our opportunities, and not wasted the three years 
spent under them; and that the seeds which they 
have^laiited in us have been so cultivated that they 
will gftjgjtorth strong, hardy vines.
We must use all our knowledge and ability if we 
really desire to reach the great goal. We, none of us 
can fail to accomplish something in life, if we put 
into the work all that is in us. Aim high. Struggle, 
push and climb. Be not satisfied with good, and cease 
not until you have attained the best. And through it 
all keep in mind our motto
“To make and inspire the home;
To lessen suffering and increase happiness;
To aid mankind in its upward struggles;
To ennoble and adorn life’s work however humble;
These are woman’s high prerogatives.”
To the Faculty we owe all we have attained — to 
them alone belongs the credit. Our efforts would 
have been in vain had not their guiding hand led us 
on to the success we have attained. With each one 
of us will remain unto the end kind remembrances 
of these happy and profitable days; all made pos­
sible through the benificence of him who dedicated, in 
his mother’s name, our school. For them we; send up 
our prayer to Him who rules above.
“Lord, keep their memories green.”
Editor’s Note:—Each year on “Class Day” the 
graduating class of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie
School, for Women plants an ivy vine against the 
foundations of the school building. This is done 
with appropriate ceremonies. The most important 
part being the delivery of “The Ivy Oration” by a 
member of the class. Last year this custom was in­
stituted, the orator being selected by the P^aculty. 
This year, however, it was decided by the Faculty, to 
make the Ivy Oration competitive, Miss Sara Grant 
Williams, of Crafton, Pa., was the fortunate competi­
tor.
HISTORY OF 1910.
A chronicle of each step (from Plebe to graduate) 
of the metaphcrphic process we (the class of 1910) 
have undergone here at Tech would make, beyond 
doubt, a most interesting study, but is much too 
intricate and lengthy a task for this occasion. How­
ever, we have been taught that a review is neces­
sary to securely fix the knowledge obtained from 
any course. Hence, as we have heard in Economics 
(or contracts, I forgot which), “Let me review the 
chief points to be kept in mind.”
Gentlemen—You must certainly remember (when 
we were all Plebes together) our little group with 
the Sophs on the hill yonder, when we were first 
forced to show our suepriority as a class, and those 
heated rebates in class meetings between Joe of 
“Keg Party” fame, and the Irish School Director, 
are as well remembered as the Evolution lectures 
and the troubles of a personality course.
It was in those early days of intersection base­
ball that the picture of our famous ’Varsity athlete 
“Peaches,” valiently leading in the defense of our 
numerals on the paint fence against the Industrials, 
was stamped on our memories; and when the School 
welcomed home our Director from his inspection 
visit of foreign schools. On this occasion, although 
only Plebes, we wrorked like truck horses, cheered 
ourselves hoarse and were present at the M. M. C. 
S. dance, won by forcing our presence through win­
dows upon our fair neighbors. It wasn’t the Teddy 
Bear twins who through force of habit lead the 
drum serenade against the Maggies that year, but 
the Irish bricklayer and politician who had the in­
spiration, and the twins merely took advantage of 
the opportunity of again presenting themselves be­
fore the gentler sex.
The start of the Junior year was the parting of 
the ways. Though all Plebes together, many of our 
members forsook all 1910 for the bed of roses which 
the four-year course presented. Most assuredly we 
will never forget that year with its schedule of 34 
hours and German. We wore that worried, hag­
gard look of men overworked, but still defied the 
faculty to flunk us. The brief respites from Cal­
culus Smith found in sleeping through Geology and 
Crystallography lectures were certainly welcome 
ones as was that of the Sesqui-Centennial parade, 
when we showed our interest in civic affairs, and 
the noble figure of the Materials Department was so 
gracefully unseated by his fiery mount. It was

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN?
during this year that we learned to do 30 pairs in a 
24-hour day—and still sleep occasionally, “Tag” 
complained that he could not find time to see her, 
and if it had not been for the Junior Prom all would 
have been lost—and Tag wasn’t the only one; 1910 
covered herself with glory the night of that dance, 
for it was one of those “best times I ever had oc­
casions, for all who attended, as was shown by the 
fellows’ wilted collars, and the fact that “Tag”—and 
others—still hold their own. Hiram and his able 
colleagues put out that renowned 1910 Thistle and 
made it the book of our college days, which 30 years 
from now will be used to prove the superiority of all 
things as they were when we were boys.
Of course this last year with the weight of the 
school upon our shoulders we have become the truly 
dignified Senior, and have carried ourselves as such. 
Even the dissensions in meetings as to whether the 
pin should have blue enamel or Capt’s monotonous 
cry of “got any money” were met with dignity. How­
ever, when away from school on the mid-year trips 
it was rumored that the Civils and Miners stirred 
things up a bit. All year things have gone smoothly, 
and as they should until May, when some of us were 
driven to stir ourselves most suddenly to corral the 
required credits for graduation or learn and pass 
off some forgotten modern language.
All this is past now, our history as a class is 
nearly completed, and we as individuals must go out 
in the cold world, search for a job at $60 per, and 
make history as individuals, I suppose just out of 
force of habit.

EMERSON P. POSTE GRADUATE ASSISTANT.
Yes, ’tis Emerson and more exactly Emerson Peck 
Poste. Not only is he posted by name but also is he 
posted in chemistry and he can hand out the in­
formation on that subject, by pecks, bushels, liters, 
separate sdcks or framed.
Mr. Poste is a resident of, but listen unto the list, 
New York, South Carolina, Massachusetts, New 
Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and lastly Pennsyl­
vania.
Emerson sojourned long enough in New York state, 
to graduate with honor from Starkey Seminary in 
1907 and came to Pittsburgh the following fall. Thus 
New York and Pennsylvania are accounted for. The 
reason for the others must “remain a matter of vague 
and visionary conjective, but know all men by these 
presents that Mr. Poste was not a fugitive from jus­
tice.
Since E. P. P. has been among us, he has been 
secretary and treasurer of the Crucible Club, Tartan 
representative, and a member of the smoking room 
and senior picture committees.
Incidentaly when school opens in the fall Mr. Poste 
will occupy the chair of graduate assistant in the 
Chemical Engineering Department and rest assured 
he will answer the litmus test, not that he is an acid, 
nor yet a base, but he can tell you what and why
when it comes to chemistry. Emerson is also a firm 
believer in college Y. M. C. A.

NEW INSTRUCTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.
This is to announces the appointment of Mr. J. 
Howard McCullouch as an instructor in the Depart­
ment of Health for the coming year. Mr. McCul­
louch graduates this year from the International 
Training School, Springfield, Mass., which is an 
agency of the Young Men’s Christian Associations. 
He is a graduate of the College of the City of New 
York. During his three years at Springfield he has 
had much to do with the management of athletics. 
He has been captain of foct-ball and base-ball teams, 
and last year assisted in the instruction of classes. 
He has also acted as assistant coach. His connec­
tion with the various teams has brought him in 
touch with all the big Eastern colleges, and is there­
fore well equipped to take up his work as instructor 
in our health department.
It is understood that Mr. McCullouch will not act 
as coach, but as an instructor he will co-operate 
with Dr. Savage, and the coaches who may be ap­
pointed by the athletic association,

The passing of the Quaich is a Scottish rite which 
was inaugurated at the First Class Day held, June 
16th, 1908. On that occasion President Foster, in 
making his remarks to the Juniors, spoke of the 
rivalry that had always existed and as evidence of 
final peace and good fellowship, presented the Junior 
President, Watrous, with a small horn quaich; this 
was handed from one to another of the Juniors 
present. This first quaich was loaned to the class 
for the occasion by James Scott, of the Carnegie 
Steel Company. Last year Mr. Scott presented to 
the school a large silver quaich which was used for 
the first time at the class day exercises. President 
Dowling handed it d:xwn to the Juniors. Noble of 
the Juniors received it on that day and passed it 
among his fellows. This year’s Class Day is then 
the first anniversary of the new quaich.
In regard to the historical meaning of the quaich: 
Among the old Scotch Clans the quaich was passed 
at social gatherings as eveidence of good fellow­
ship. As they drank to each other’s health all war­
like tendencies were forgotten.
Nothing could be more symbolical of the final ex­
pressions of brotherly feeling between Seniors and 
Juniors, than this ancient custom. All class feuds 
are forever put aside for the common feeling of in­
terest in one cause, the promotion of the good name 
of the Alma Mater.
In this, our last issue of the year, we wish to thank 
all those who have helped to make this year one of 
the most successful in Tartan history. We are 
losing two of our Associate Editors, Miss Josephine
Mandeville and Miss Edith Scott Glenn. We take 
this opportunity to publicly thank them for their ef­
forts and to express our appreciation of their work.

THE TARTAN
D. K. REID, VALEDICTORIAN.
CLASS DAY 1910.
Next to the baseball game the greatest event of 
Monday was the class day exhibition, Secretary Cul­
bertson acting as chairman introduced the actors and 
mixed in a good amount of wit and humor as each 
presentation was made.
O. W. A. Oetting, president of the day class, made 
the address of welcome, and started the vein of good 
humor which continued through the program. J. K. 
Reed, as historian for the night class, said that asking 
a member of the class to review its history was like 
asking an oarsman to describe a race in which he had 
taken part. He, however, succeeded in making public 
many highly entertaining things. L. L. Beeken re­
viewed the doings of the day men, and did not for­
get that “we were all Plebes together.” From him 
we learned the cause of Taggart’s perpetual grouch, 
and the attitude of the Faculty on some phases of Tri- 
Junior work.
J. W. Herron, as donor for the men of darkness, 
presented each with an appropriate gift, bought as he 
said, with his own money. All gifts were appro­
priate and the humor of the speaker kept the crowd in 
laughter. The sensation of the day was the pre­
sentation of a bull pup to Mr. T. K. Reed, it being, 
as the donor said, the only thing he needed to become 
a man of fashion. Another hit was the nomination 
of Culbertson to the editorial staff of the War Cry. 
One of the class rewarded the donor by presenting 
him with a large bouquet of garden truck, for which 
he seemed thankful.
Jiram A. Neel (the mighty Hiram) passed out the 
gifts and appropriate remarks to the day men. Every­
thing was fitting and met with applause. Mason 
and Charles were made happy by receiving diplomas 
for extra work done. “Dad” Glasser was hailed as 
hero and presented with a large medal in the form 
of a discus. It being as a reward for bravery shown 
on the field in being able to stop the advance of 
the enemy, even at the expense of broken bones. 
Johnson, the only Swede, received his national flag. 
Stevenson received an appropriate lunch. And Poste, 
ye honor man, and newly appointed graduate as^
sistant, received—yes received—a souvenir of Tech 
—most appropriate.
The Teddy Bear twins were remembered by being 
pinned together as one forever. Just as Hiram finish­
ed his spiel, a telegram was received by wireless 
nominating him for membership in the Ananias club. 
This was signed T.. R., and certainly came at an 
appropriate time.
Archibald took a serious view, and in truly theologi­
cal tones predicted great things for those who con­
tinued to cling to the ideals fostered during their 
school years. Then came the passing of the quaich, 
the one truly Scotch observance. Chairman Culbert­
son called upon Dean Leete, who gave the history of 
the quaich, and its true meaning in our school life. 
Noble made the presentation address and handed the 
bowl to President Woods of the night Juniors. Woods 
assured the mighty Seniors of the Juniors ability to 
live up to all precedents.
Last and greatest came the valedictorian, D. K. 
Reid, a true Scotchman, in every way qualified to 
express the sentiments of the Seniors toward the 
Founder and Faculty for their part in the “making of 
men.”
CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY MEETING.
The regular June meeting of the society was held 
Friday evening, June 10th. In spite of the heavy rain 
a large number of members reported. After the regu­
lar business had been dispatched the meeting was 
thrown open to general discussions. Professor Thayer 
led off with remarks on the possibilities for engineers 
in heaven, many good points were brought out and 
the conclusion reached was that the Civil Engineer 
had as good a chance as any other. Professor Mott 
told of the aims of the Pennsylvania Society of En­
gineers. He attended their recent meeting at Harris­
burg, and briefly described the proceedings. He also 
gave an account of the Harrisburg filter plant.
R. P. Bascom told the members how to get a job, 
and how to hold it. This was illustrated by many per­
sonal experiences.
“Before getting a job,” said he, “you must look and 
act as if you were perfectly capable, don’t be afraid 
to run a little ‘bluff.’ ”
The remainder of the session was spent discussing 
the proposed licensing of engineers. Many good 
points were brought out. The best proposition was 
that the engineering student before being given a de­
gree should have his work approved by some society 
or commission of practicing men. This is practically 
the way architectural work is judged by the Beaux 
Arts Society.
This being the last meeting of the year the senior 
members were given a fond farewell, with best wishes 
for professional success.
The students of the Massachusetts Institute ofx 
Technology in a unanimous vote expressed their dis­
approval of the adoption of the honor system in that 
institution,

1910 FOOT BALL SCHEDULE.
Manager Scott announces the following football 
schedule for the season of 1910. While one of the 
games is not yet signed up, there is no reason to be­
lieve that the final schedule will be other than the one 
announced below.
It will be noticed that a total of eight games is 
called for, four of which are to be played at Tech 
Field. As has been the custom, we open with Waynes- 
burg, on our own grounds. The next game, with 
State, is away. The following Saturday, October 
15th, Grove City comes here and the following week 
Geneva. On the 29th we again renew football relation 
with W. & J., the game being played in Washington, 
Pa. Allegheny then returns to Pittsburgh as the 
attraction on the 5th.
It may be remembered that in the issue of Novem­
ber 3th, the Tartan printed an editorial headed “The 
Lehigh Game,” in which it was suggested that the 
game be made an annual feature on our schedule. The 
“Brown and White” commented favorably on the sug­
gestion and we are only too glad to see that the man­
agers have carried the suggestion out. Tech will go 
to South Bethlehem for the return game on November 
12.
The last game on the schedule is with our old 
friend Pitt, the game to be played on their grounds.
The Football Schedule.
October 1—Waynesburg College at Tech Field.

SOPHOMORE M ECHANI ALS “FEED.”
The Sophomore Mechanicals enjoyed a most de­
lightful banquet, Wednesday evening, June 1st, at 
the Hotel Henry. Twenty men sat down at the festal 
board. The affair was given in honor of Prof. Trinks, 
who, as speaker of the evening, made the occasion 
one long to be remembered, by his genial disposi­
tion and pithy jests. A program of after-dinner 
speeches was very succssfully carried out and the 
entire evening proved the growth and increasing 
development of that thing of things, the “good old 
Tech spirit.”
MECHANICAL SOCIETY BANQUET.
The Carnegie Mechanical Society held its last and 
most enthusiastic meeting of the year last Saturday 
evening, June 11th, when the members and prospec­
tive members of that club were banquetted at the 
German Club by Prof. Trinks. Seventy-five good, live 
fellows were present, among them being many old 
familiar faces, Alumni returned once more. President 
Smith called a business meeting at 8:30. The fol­
lowing officers were elected for the coming school 
year: President, H. T. Woods; vice president, David 
Henderson; treasurer, S. L. McCartney; secretary, 
Harry Holiday. The speaker of the evening was Mr. 
J. M. Nesbit, patent attorney, Park Building, who 
gave a very entertaining and instructive talk on 
“Fundamentals of the Patents Law.” Mr. Nesbit gave 
some very interesting information on the workings of 
the patent system in the United States and its con­
nection with engineering professions. After the 
meeting, the members sat down to a delightful “feed”, 
Dutch style, which went straight to the spot, as did 
the smokes, jokes and songs which filled in the 
space after dinner. The affair was most successful 
in creating a maximum of good-fellowship and fun. 
Prof. Trinks is to be congratulated upon his genial­
ness and sociability as host.
Alma Mater.
(Tune: Auld Lang Syne)
Let all our voices now be raised 
In song to fill the air;
And all our hearts with music praise, 
Our Alma Mater fair.
Chorus.
Carnegie Tech, we honor thee,
And fondly sing thy praise;
We pledge our lives in memory,
Thy sons on high to raise.
Let all the echoes ring out clear,
In joyful strains so true 
And greet the Tartan with a cheer, 
Red, yellow, green and blue.
Then keep our hopes ascending high, 
Far reaching to the sky,
And make us thrill with pride in thee, 
Wherever we may be.
Amici.
Our strong band can ne’er be broken, 
Formed in C. T. S.
Far surpassing wealth unspoken,
Ever more shall bless.
Chorus
Amici usque ad aras,
Deep graven on each heart,
Shall be found unwavering true 
When we from life shall part,
College life at best is passing,
Here’s to all success,
Then let us pledge in word and deed 
Our love for C. T. S.
A HOT TIME IN A COLD TOWN.
Confusion reigned in Antarctic City. The trolley 
cars had stopped and the most strenuous efforts of 
the motormen to move them was without avail. All 
telegraph and telephone systems refused to work and 
the city was in stygian darkness. All business was 
at a standstaill.
“Where is the electrical engineer from the Carnegie 
Technical Schools” was asked on all sides.
Quickly he was brought forth and as quickly he 
apprehended the situation.
“Put torches under the trolley lines and build fires 
along the rails,” he commanded brusquely, “and 
put hot water on the telegraph and telephone cables.’’ 
His orders were immediately executed and to the 
great amazement of the people, the cars began to 
creep along, and in a short time attained their full 
speed. The street lamp began to glow, telephone and 
telegraph apparatus sputtered and soon came to 
normal working order.
The cause of the trouble was at once apparent: 
the juice had been frozen.
With howls of delight the citiens gathered around 
the engineer.
“Rah! rah! rah!” they cried. “Rah! rah! rah Tech! 
Tech! Tech!”
The great engineer acknowledged the salute and 
retired.

THE “INFERNO”.
By permission of the immortal Shade of Dante. 
Canto I.
Third way upon the journey of our life,
I found myself within a forest dark.
While I was rushing downward to the lowland 
Before my eyes did one present himself,
Who seemed from long continued rhyming hoarse. 
“Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,
“Which’er thou art or shade or real man.’
He answered me, “Not man, Plebe once I was,
But long ago I left your college halls;
A poet was I and sang I of that School
Where Science held her stern and dreadful sway.”
Then knew I he was Jingling Johnson bold,
Who smeared around his awful bunch of rhyme. 
Then said I unto him, “Poet I thee entreat 
That me through Hell thou safely wouldst conduct, 
That I might see the fate of those stern men 
Who while on Earth made us disconsolate.”
Then he moved on, and I behind him followed 
And entered we a deep and savage way,
These words in sombre color I beheld 
Written upon the summit of a gate,
“This is the place where shades of men are fried, 
All hope abandon, ye who enter in.”
So passing through the gates our Profs, we saw,
And heard their curses rend the sulphurous air.
Canto II.
So we went on for long the way before us:
Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter 
The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss. 
Therein, so far as I had power to hear 
Were lamentations none, nor even sighs,
For here were those who while on earth were square. 
Upon a pile of brimstone smoking hot,
Was on who seemed the torment to enjoy:
For with his apparatus he essayed 
The calorific heat of brimstone to obtain.
While busy at his side was one who smiled 
And sought the lustrous spectrum of the flame. 
Hell had no terrors for this happy pair 
For even here they rode their hobbies still,
And others too had found congenial tasks,
And happy in their torment seemed to be.
Then passed we to a circle farther in,
Where dwelt those shades who greater punishment 
deserved.

Canto ill.
Here first was one who up a theta cone,
A tangent sphere of heated aid did roll;
Yet ever as the vertex he did reach 
It tumbled down and he must try again.
With engine plans and slide rule figured one 
Who damned the place an inefficient hole,
And said for half a kopeck he would build 
A better Hell from what was wasted here.
Just then an awful stench did reach my nose, 
And near a heap of burning rubber was 
A shade, who chased an ion to and fro 
To apprehend it for his storage cell,
That he would run with liquid H, O.
An awful din did strike my trembling ear.
As seven imps upon an organ did perform, 
While he who built it listened in despair,

The Standard of Excellence
As through his brain, the awful discord ran.
Another still his system did impress 
Upon all things that came within his ken;
Yet found he that his system was untried,
And Hell in chaos still must ever roll.
We then passed on into the lower depths,
And left behind these ones with many more 
Who likewise here their punishment received. 
Within the Inner Circle did we see 
A shade who on a wheatstcne bridge was bound,
And loudly begger for water from an imp.
And then unto my guide I spake and said,
“Is this poor shade by thirst to torture be?”
He answered me, “Ah, no, he only seeks 
The water his analogy to run.”
Then saw I one who on the earth was famed 
For lectures on the cbstruse parts of math.
A toy house he strove in vain to build 
Of blocks which of the fourth dimension were;
And ever as he set them into place,
They turned themselves completely inside out.
Still further in was one who seemed imprisoned fast 
By four great CUTS which hedged him in all sides,
While from Elysian fields was born the din,
Of fans who shouted, “Wagner’s at the bat”!
Impotently he clenched h’s hands and cried,
“Oh for my freedom just to see the game.’’
But at these sights my tortured nerves did break 
And fell I down and fainted dead away.
