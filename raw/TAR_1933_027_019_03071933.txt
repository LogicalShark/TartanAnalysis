Three graduates of the Depart­
ment. of Architecture are- among 
the eight chosen to be finalists in 
the recent judgment of the Second 
Preliminary for the Paris Prize. 
They are Onnie Mankki ’31, James 
A. Mitchell '32, and Dahleu K. 
Ritchey '32.
The, Paris Prize requires two 
preliminaries before a winner can 
be selected. The First Prelimin­
ary includes all Class “A” Design 
students throughout the nation. All 
but about ten students are elimin­
ated as a result of this prelimin­
ary, and to these ten are added 
certain graduates and others who 
have earned the right to proceed 
to the Second Preliminary direct­
ly, bringing the number up to 
twenty-five. Of this number five 
or ten are chosen to be finalists as 
a result of the Second Preliminary. 
A competition so large and selec­
tive as this accords honor i\ot only 
to the winner but also to the men 
who have reached the finals. It is 
a remarkable and rare case when 
an architectural school can claim 
as its graduates three out of eight 
finalists and consequently much of 
the credit that these men have 
merited is reflected back on the 
school where they received their 
training.
Onnie Mankki graduated with 
honors and was awarded upon 
graduation a scholarship to Prince­
ton University. After one year 
there he was offered post as in­
structor at Virginia Polytechnic In­
stitute where he is at present. .
.Tames A. Mitchell graduated 
with the highest average in his 
class and was awarded the Ameri­
can Institute of Architects’ medal 
(Continued On Page Three.)
The annual Interfraternity Ball 
will be held this Friday in the 
main ballroom of the William Penn 
Hotel. Emerson Gill and his well 
known orchestra will provide mu­
sic for the dancing which will take 
place from 9 until 2 o’clock. The 
assessment for this gear's dance 
has been set at three dollars 
couple.
Ira F. Kuhn is chairman of the 
ball this year. Mr. Kuhn is presi­
dent of the Delta Tau Delta social 
fraternity, president of Industries 
Senate, social chairman of the Stu­
dent Council, a Dragon and a mem­
ber of the varsity swimming team. 
He will lead the grand march with 
Olive Roberts, a student in the De­
partment. of Painting and Decorat­
ing and a member of Beta Pi sor­
ority.
Elaborate decorations will add to 
the beauty of the ballroom. The 
novel lighting effects and the ban­
ners of the various fraternities will 
lend a friendly atmosphere to the 
function. The grand march, which 
will start at 12 o’clock, -will be one 
of the most colorful features of 
the dance. Those attending the 
ball are asked to gather in the cor­
ridor shortly before 12 o’clock.
Emerson Gill is well known for 
his Brunswick phonograph record­
ings and his NBC broadcasts. His 
engagements include many famous 
hotels, restaurants, and college 
dances throughout the county. Mr. 
Gill brings with him ten very tal­
ented musicians and one feminine 
soloist.
As has been the custom for a 
number of_ yeai's,- corsages will 
be considered out of order.
Tlie.patrons and patronesses ior 
the dance are: Dr. Thomas S.
Baker, Dr. and Mrs. Arthur C.

CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Prof. J. Vick O’Brien, Head of 
the Music Department in the Col­
lege of Fine Arts, and conductor of 
the Carnegie Symphony Orchestra, 
was born in Pittsburgh and re­
ceived his early education here. 
1-Ie began to study piano at Mt. 
?ralitzen Seminary at Ebensbm-g, 
Pa., and before his thirteenth year 
had composed 
some lyric 
piece3 for pi­
ano.
After study­
ing in Pitts­
burgh under 
Adolph Foers- 
ter, Luigo von 
Ivunitz and Jo­
seph Otteu, he 
went to Notre 
Dame in 1S96 
for two years. 
From 1902 to 
1912 Professor 
O’Brien was a 
student at. the 
1-Iochschule, Berlin, Germany, un­
der Humperdinck, Frederick Koch, 
Carl Theil, Jose Vianna da Motta 
aind others of that time.
Pir.ofessor O’Brien came to Car- 
negie\in the fall of 1912 as Head of 
the Miusic Department which was 
being formed at that time/ It was
J. Vick O’Brien
not until 1914 that he increased 
the instrumental ensemble to 
orchestral proportions. Since then 
he has spent his time principally 
in teaching and coniposing. in
1926 he studied composition in Ber­
lin under Paul Juon.
Professor O’Brien has written 
about fifty songs which are pub­
lished by G. Schirmer, and com­
posed incidental and ballet music 
for “Chaplet of Pan,” “Ye Olde 
Virginia,” H,our Before Dawn” and 
“Roses of Mercatel,” of which the 
last two have been presented by 
the Music Department with dis­
tinct success. He is also the com­
poser of the Institute Alma Mater.
His love of athletics, especially 
baseball (first base) and football, 
still survives from his Notre Dame 
days, and often he may be seen 
down on the practice field. The 
seashore is his vacational prefer­
ence because of its unexcelled re­
cuperative effect.
To quote, from an article about 
Professor O’Brien, "When the 
School of Technology chose Mr. 
O’Brien as its music head . . . 
they brought into their group not 
only one of the best trained musi­
cians of the State, but a native 
Pittsburgher as well; one that has 
pride in his art and profession, but 
not holding it more dear than his 
belief in Pittsburgh and the school 
which he leads.”
Cwens Will Hold 
Dance in Thistle 
Hall Next Tues
A strikingly novel St. Patrick's 
Day tea dance will be sponsored on 
Tuesday, March 14, by Cwens, na­
tional sophomore honorary for 
women.
Several unusual features, which 
have been hitherto unheard-of, are 
to be introduced at the tea dance. 
Permission has been granted to 
serve refreshments during the 
course of the afternoon. This fea­
ture alone should add a festive air 
to the dance. The smoking lounge 
downstairs will be opened especial 
ly for the convenience of the 
guests.
A second novelty to be presented 
by the Cwens will be the donation 
of appropriate “favors" to all who 
attend the tea dance. However, 
strict secrecy as to this feature 
being enforced. The popular ad­
mission price of twenty-five cents 
is to be retained.
Burt Weidenhamer and his 
WJAS staff orchestra, the Sylva­
nians, have been engaged to play 
at the St. Patrick’s Day dance. 
This popular 10-piece orchestra 
which played to a "full house” last 
week at the University of Pitts­
burgh Freshman Dance, has played 
in and around Pittsburgh for sev­
eral seasons. Last summer the 
Sylvanians were sponsored by the 
Pliilco Radio Company to play all 
season in London, Ontario. A few 
years ago, the orchestra was fea­
tured at tlie Carnegie5 Spring Car 
nival. The orchestra has had en­
gagements at many of the colleges 
in the vicinity of Pittsburgh, 
Among them are Waynesburg Col­
lege, and W. & J. where the Syl­
vanians provided the music for the 
Cotillion. The committee for the 
tea dance feels that the music of 
the Sylvanians will do much to in­
spire a spirit of festivity appropri­
ate to an Irish Saint’s Day.
Cwens assisting Thelma Shelly, 
general chairman, are Veronica 
Kloog and Margaret Barr; other 
chairmen are Madolin Vautrinot, 
posters; Virginia Cooper and Mar­
garet Watters, refreshments;
Daisy Clark, tickets; and Julia 
Hubbard, novelty' chairman.
Two new appointments have 
been made to the Tartan staff; 
Elizabeth Preller, former News 
Editor has been made Managing 
Editor; and Dolly Allison, a former 
associate editor is now News Edi­
tor.
Miss Preller is a member of Mor­
tar Board, Alpha Chi Alpha, and 
is vice-president of the W. A. A. 
Miss Allison, also a member of Al­
pha Chi Alpha, is Managing Editor 
of Tri-Publications. Both girls are 
members of the Secretarial De­
partment and former Cweus.
Due to the fact that the Manag­
ing Editor appointed last year did 
not return to school in the fall, the 
work connected with this position 
has been done until now by a man­
aging board composed of junior ed­
itors. The position of Managing 
Editor is one of the highest at­
tainable on the staff, ranking sec­
ond only to that of editor-in-chief, 
and in case of a vacancy in the 
position of editor-in-chief, it is fill­
ed by the Managing Editor. The 
appointment of Miss Preller marks 
the third time that this position 
has been filled by a woman
It is necessary to have worked 
three years on the staff in order to 
secure either of these positions, 
The first two years are spent in re­
porting, the third as a junior edi­
tor, and at the end of the third 
year appointments are made to im­
portant positions on the staff.
Phillip Auten was recently ap­
pointed business manager of Tri- 
Publications to fill a vacancy in 
that position. Mr.-Auten is a mem­
ber of Delta Upsilon social fra­
ternity.

The action of Student Council 
in removing the Arts Ball from the 
social calendar due to negligence 
and mishandling of this, year’s af­
fair on February 17 is authorized 
by the power vested in it by the 
Executive Board of Carnegie, 
whereby it is to control all non- 
atliletic functions of organizations 
in all the colleges.
The Board in 1927 specifically 
ordered Council supervision after 
approving the petition of the Arts 
Senate that the deficits resulting 
from previous Balls be taken out 
Of breakage fée deposits,
The present Council system has 
been in effect since April 2, 1923, 
when the Student Council and the 
Board of Student Activities were 
merged.
A committee composed of repre­
sentatives of the old Council and 
Activities Board after a three-year 
study submitted a proposed con­
stitution to the Executive Board 
and approval followed on April 17, 
1923. The Board in approving the 
constitution with its grant of pow­
ers, reserved the right to review, 
and to annul if necessary, any ac­
tions taken by the Council that, in 
the judgment of the Executive 
Board, were not in accord with the 
best interests of the institution.
The grant of powers extended to 
the Council reads as follows:
1. Have jurisdiction over all 
day student activities and under­
graduate organizations in the Car­
negie Institute of Technology.
2. Recommend to the Adminis­
tration each year the amount of 
the activities fee. and be responsi­
ble for its distribution and expen­
diture.
3. Authorize and supervise all 
drives for funds for special pur­
poses.
4. Establish and perpetuate cus­
toms and traditions.
5. Supervise freshman regula­
tions.
6. Act on all questions, pertain­
ing to the four colleges as a unit.
7. Assume financial responsibil­
ity for the upkeep of the Carnegie 
Union, and authorize all student 
functions held therein,
S. Decide, on such questions of 
discipline as may be submitted by 
the Faculty Discipline Committee.
9. To have a voting member in 
legislative sessions of thé Institute 
Discipline Committee.
10. Control all non-athletic func­
tions of organizations in the col­
leges.
The Arts Ball Committee claimed 
that rightfully supervision of the 
Arts Ball is granted to the Arts 
Senate, making this interpretation 
of section 33, “Regulations for the 
Guidance of Undergraduate Stu­
dents,” which is as follows : Af­
fairs concerning the students of 
any one College onlj' are under the 
direction of the Student Senate of 
that College, on which each class 
has representation.
Clearly, however, the action of 
the Executive Board in February, 
1927, was intended to provide Stu­
dent Council supervision of the 
Arts Ball.
Resolution Passed 
Abolishing Ball
Owing to negligence and mis­
handling of the whole affair by 
the Arts Committee, I move 
.that the Arts Ball be dropped 
from the Social Calendar under 
Student Council, with the stipu­
lation that Arts Senate be al­
lowed to petition Student Coun­
cil for Its reinstatement, if the 
petition is signed by 300 stu­
dents of the Arts School.

Dropping of the Arts Ball from 
the social calcendar by Student 
Council last Tuesday night is an­
other episode in the history of this 
colorful office.
The first of what later was to be 
known as the Arts Ball was held 
in 1915 in tlie drafting room of the 
Department of Architecture, Col­
lege of Fine Arts.
The following year the foyer of 
the College of Fine Arts was tlie 
scene of the ball Tor the first, time. 
Annually thereafter, until 1927, the 
ball, usually held near the end of 
the first semester, was a feature 
of the social calendar of the Col­
lege of Fine Arts.
Difficulties arose when after the
1927 Ball the deficits incurred in 
previous Balls during the 192-1-27 
period totaled $800. The Executive 
Board at the petition of the Arts 
Senate in February, 1927, permit­
ted this deficit lo be taken out of 
breakage fee deposits which at 
that time were assessed every stu­
dent, on condition, however, that 
each student would authorize the 
deduction over his or her signa­
ture.
The Executive Board further de­
manded that budgets for future 
Balls be approved by Student
Council; that there be a more rigid 
system of requisitioning; and that 
thereafter the events be held bi-en- 
nially.
Prior to this time, the Ball had 
been supervised by the Arts Sen­
ate with little Student Council reg­
ulation, and the accumulation of 
yearly deficits finally resulted in 
action by the Executive Board
which placed the affair under the 
direct. supervision of Student
Council.
No Ball was held the following 
year, 1928, in accordance with the 
new regulations. Prior to the sched­
uled 1929 Ball, Student Council 
with previous deficits still in mind, 
demanded that $750 be realized
from advance ticket sales before 
permission would be given to hold 
the affair. The committee was un­
able to meet this requirement and 
consequently no Ball was held that 
year.
The 1931 affair was therefore the 
first held under the new ararnge- 
ment. Since Council has assumed 
charge, profits have been shown in 
1931 and this year.
COMING EVENTS

Because the Arts Ball Committee 
failed to co-operate with the Stu­
dent Council, and because of tlio 
apparent disregard lor the Coun­
cil’s authority as given to it by the 
Executive Board and embodied in 
the Council’s constitution, negli­
gence, and mishandling of affairs, 
the Council passed a resolution last 
Tuesday evening which will elim­
inate the Arts Ball from the Stu­
dent Council’s social calendar in 
future years.
Only after 300 or more College of 
Fine Arts students petition the 
Council through its Senate will 
re-instatenient be considered.
The action of the Council was r 
result of the Arts Ball Committee’! 
action on the eve of the Ball whe)
It sent the following letter to foul 
members of the Council compll 
mentary ticket list and to one stu 
dent whose name is not on the list;
Dear Mr, ----------------After consultuition with Mr. ICcohlo, Di­rector of the CoIIoko of Fine Art«, I llmt 
that by an action of Student Council you will receive a complimentary ticket to tlio 
Art’s Ball. However, those tloketa wiil bo 
jrivcn without the approval of our com­
mittee.Inasmuch as it) it» a tradition for tho ball to ho expressly for student's ami alumni of tho Arts School, your presence 
will l>e considered contrary to the wishes 
of tho committe«.Sincerely,

According to tliq constitution• of 
the Student Council, all campus 
functions, except, athletic affairs, 
are under control of the Student*. 
Council, and all matters pertaining 
to social and other activities on tho 
campus must bo considered and 
approved by the Council. In con­
sidering the matter at the meeting; 
last Tuesday, a letter of recommen­
dations to Lhe next Arts Ball Com­
mittee was read by Robert Robin­
son, ’3't, chairman of tho Special 
Committeo of the Council, which, 
according t.o members of the Coun­
cil showed up many of tlie deficien­
cies of Lhe committee’s work. In 
Lhe CommlLtee’s recommendations, 
it sLaLos that there should be a bet­
ter understanding of tho relation­
ship of the Committee and Student 
Council and a clear cut statement 
be made concerning Lhe powers of 
bolh groups in Lhe management o” 
the Ball.
At this point in the reading o 
the recommendations, Ira Kuhn 
social chairman of the Studen 
Council, asked Lhe chairman of Lhi 
Arts Committee why it was that 
the Arts Ball Committ.ee disregard­
ed the powers of Student Council 
concerning the complimentary 
tickets which were issued to indi­
viduals on tlie Council compli­
mentary ticket list.
Mr. Dietz said in reply:
“The root of the trouble was mis­
understanding. Respective powers 
of the Arts Committee and Student 
Council were not clear. The Com­
mittee had to go to the Constitu­
tion as put forth in the Whit© 
Book. First, we read that any 
function that was entirely under 
one school was to be handled by 
the Senate of that school.”
Mr. Ryder [president of the Col­
lege of Fine Arts Senate] and the 
Arts Senate appointed me as chair­
man. I considered that official and 
acted under that authority. In re­
gard to complimentary tickets, w< 
were told that Student Council wai 
to receive seven tickets and thaj 
precedence was the only basis foi 
this ruling. Since there was onlj

Y.M.C.A. May Hold Model World 
Economics Conference on Campus
In view of the International 
Economic Conference to be held 
in London, the IntercollegiaLe Dis­
armament Council is planning 
model World Economic Confer­
ences for any college interested. 
At Carnegie, Lhe conference will be 
in charge of the Y. M. C. A.
In order to make a conference 
of this kind worthwhile, it will bo 
necessary for at least twenty Car­
negie students to participate in the 
conference as representatives from 
various foreign countries. Those 
students interested in the project 
are asked to report to Rollin V. 
Davis, Y. Mp C. A. secretary, as 
soon as possible so that prepara­
tion for the event can be made.
According to plan, the procedure 
of the mock conference will follow 
as closely as possible that of the 
proposed London Conference, and 
the topics will be discussed by the 
various delegates from the view­
point of the countries they are 
representatives, rather than from 
a personal point of view.
A three-day program, which will 
include discussions on "Gold and
Finance,” ‘‘Trade Barriers,” and 
“War Debts and Reparations,” has 
been devised by Lhe InLorcoIlegiale. 
Disarmament Conference for Lhoso 
schools wishing t0 have the pro­
posed conference on their campus; 
The student delegates will act on 
commissions under faculty super­
vision. The exact statements ot 
Lhe lopics will be sent to the stu­
dents intending to take an uctivo 
part in the conference, thus 
minimizing the difficulty In special­
izing research.
The underlying purpose of tho 
intercollegiate Disarmament Coun­
cil In planning these eebnomic con­
ferences is to broaden tho outlook 
on world affairs of the men and 
women in the colleges and universi­
ties of the United States. It ia 
hoped that such procedure will pro­
duce for the future the sort of 
leaders who possess the nec­
essary appreciation of international realities.
If Carnegie does decide to hold 
an economic conference, it will bo 
necessary for the Economics De­
partment to give its full coopera­
tion in order to assure success.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 1933
THE
PLAID SPORTS 
SCREEN 
•
—C HAR —LAESAE
DURING THE PAST WEEK the Plaid basketball team engaged in two 
court contests, one of which was won and the other loot, making an 
even percentage for the week's play. Of the two games played one of 
them was as good as the other was bad, and paradoxically as It may 
seem, the good gamo is the one that was lost and tho bad one was 
won. Against Grove City on Tuesday night, the Tartans won by an 
overwhelming ccoro of 54-36, but it was as ragged an exhibition of 
basketball as has been played on the Carnegie floor this year. For 
thirty minutes of the game there was bad passing and poor ball hand­
ling on the part of both teams, but the ten minutes that the Skibos 
snapped out thoir carelessness was worth going miles to see.
Midway through the second half Captains Fergus and Smith start­
ed a scoring spree which netted them eleven points In three minutes 
and twenty points in less than ten minutes. Tho heretofore close 
guarding Grovers seemed unable to check the onrush, and those few 
minutes spelled defeat for the visitors. Up to that timo the game was 
close, too close for the comfort of the Plaid supporters. The Grove 
City outfit had kept In the running by tho accuracy of their long shot 
artists and no one knew but that one or two more such shots might 
win tho game for them, but the latent scoring spree put an end to any 
doubt as to who the winnor would be. :* * * * *
FRIDAY NIGHT THE DUQUESNE DUKES won their thirteenth 
straight victory ut tho expense of the Tartans who played the beat 
game I have seen them play this year. Tho Bcore was 35-27, but even 
tho score does not indicate the closeness of the contest. Neither team 
was able to penetrate very close to the opponent’s basket, and as a 
result most of the scoring was done from out on the lloor. In the iirst 
half Coach I-Iannum had instructed his proteges to employ a zone de­
fense to check tho fast cutting Bluflites. The defense worked well, for 
the Dukes got only two baskets from close up, but they had a deadly 
eye for getting them from out by the foul circle. So the second half 
tho Tartans changed to a man for man defense in order to help brealc 
up those long set shots, but the Dukes got even more accurate at a 
longer dialance, and there was just nothing that could be done about it.
In that one department only did the visitors have any advantage, 
but that ono spelled defeat. Both teams handled the ball exceptionally 
well. Tho passing was fast and accurate and not until the last few 
minutes did it toad to get slightly off color.
To point out uny individual player and shower praise upon him 
would be doing an injustice to the others, for they all played well, 
but there was one player who showed a noticeable improvement over 
his previous play and that was Ted Rigg. Tho shift from guard to for­
ward seemed to put him in his element for he really played an excel­
lent game.* * * «< *
FOR THOSE STATISTICALLY MINDED I have prepared a few figures
which may prove interesting. I have always wanted to know in a 
game just what percentage of shots were made and missed, both of 
long and short shots. So Friday night, armed with a pencil and paper,
I invaded the gym and with the aid of former “from the fence” Foote, 
and Campus Queen Steele, ! managed to compile my precious figures. 
In the first half, Duquesne made five out of eighteen long shots and 
two out of eight short ones, against three out of cightecen long ones 
and none out of two short ones for the Plaid five. In the second half
“the Bluffites were so accurate that they made seven out of ten long
ones or ones from farther out than the foul circle. They also made 
two out of six short ones—the two sleeper shots that Moore made 
right under tho basket. Tho Tartans in this half made three out 
of fourteen of the long variety and four out of six of tho ones from 
under tho basket. In tho department of foul shooting tho, Scotchmen ex­
celled, accounting for seven free throws in eleven tries against three 
out of eight for tho visitors.
So, there aro your figures, draw what conclusions you may but I 
think the results should all be the same.* H' * * *
THE WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY MITT MEN WERE a little too 
good and oxporioncod for the Plaid boxers Saturday and when tho last 
boll had rung the Mountaineers walked away with a nice live to two 
victory. Captain Carr was tho lone Sklbo glove toter who was able to 
gain a decision, Carr won a nice light from Nooley in the 135-pound 
class, a light which wan close and interesting throughout, In tho 105- 
pound class .lorry O’Toolo and Voorkeos put on tho best scrap of tho 
evening. Noitlior man had much of an advantage over"* tho other hut 
Voorkeos was a little stronger In tho final round and gained tho docl- 
nlon, Tom Coulter Buffered a knockout In tho last bout of the ovening 
to a mom olovor and oxporioncod opponent, ’T|s I mo that a boxer 
must have actual experience, but I can see little use In sacrlllclng 
a man .lust to have an entry In an ovont. Tho same was true of Me­
drano in the ’,135-potmd ovont, Medrano put up a. nice light but Ills op- 
jmnont was too skilled for him, mul finally mnnagod to knock him out 
in the second round. 1 would like to say In defense of Smith who 
/ought in tho Mn-pouwl elans that tho technical knockout which was 
awarded his opponent wan not his fault but soomod to lie an accident. 
On tho two occasions that he was on the lloor It was not a blow that 
sent him there but the pushing tactics of Ills stronger opponnot. But 
tho rule reads that If any man Is floored twice In ono round his oppo­
nent is automatically awarded a technical knockout.* * * * *
THE VARSITY SWIMMERS who made a trip to both Franklin and 
Marshall and Now York Univorulty came homo with nary a win to com- 
poriKato thom for thoir trip. Both moots ware vory close but In both 
tho Tartans canto out on tho low ond of tho scoro. Franklin and Mar­
shall was tho first victor splashing thoir way to a 35-25 win on Friday. 
Tho Lancaster boys had too well rounded a team for the Plaid.
Saturday in New York, the New Yorkers won an exceedingly closo 
contost 32-27. The Tartans took flvo first places and two thirds but 
could not muscle In for a socond place and that is what cost tho meet. 
Miller was the most consistent winner on the trip, taking first place 
in the fifty and one hundred-yard dashes In the last meet and gaining 
a tie in the first one.

In Intramural 
Court League
Undefeated Delts Loose 
To Phi Psi’s in 
Upset Game
Last week’s games in the Intra­
mural League caused some drastic 
changes on the score board. The 
undefeated Delts fell before the on­
slaught of the Phi Psis leaving the 
Alpha Sigs in the load of that 
league. Incidentally this is the 
second team that the Phi Psis 
have humbled on the way to a. 
championship, the Pi K. A's being 
the first.
In the National league it’s still 
battle between the Kappa Sigs 
and the T. X’s, and there is no­
body else in the race. Somebody 
will take second place when these 
two meet on March 15.
The Betas continued their win­
ning ways by knocking McGill out 
of the race, but it was close. This 
means that unless somebody pulls 
a surprise win thiH league (T in 
the bag and all sewed up. The 
Senior Architects lost their first 
start to the Betas and have been 
trying to make up for it ever since 
by piling up high scores averaging 
38 points a game in the last five 
starts.
PHILADELPHIA CLAN

Carnegie Court Team 
Plays Geneva Tonight; 
Georgetown Saturday
DUQUESNE TOSSERS 
DOWN PLAID, 35-27
Skibos Lose Again to Dukes; 
Defeat Grove City 
By 54-36 Score
There’s no rest for the weary as 
far as Maxle Hannum’s basketeers 
concerned, for the Tartan 
tossers, stlil a bit hazy from that 
Duquesne melee, walk right into 
another tough one tonight against 
Geneva's Tri-State Conference 
Champions. The Covenanter re- 
Lurn engagement takes place in the 
gym, beginning as usual at 8:15.
Saturday the Tartans make their 
last trip of the season when they 
drop down into Washington to en­
gage Georgetown in a very import­
ant Conference contest. The 
Iloyas, as attested by their victory 
over Pitt, are quite some combine 
to stop on their own floor so the 
Skibos will have to ‘‘shoot the 
works” if they hope to remain in 
the title chase.
Max Hannum used a zone de­
fense in the first half and a maii- 
for-man defense in the last stanza 
but the Championship Duquesne 
club met both of Der Maxie’s 
strategisms last Friday and slipped 
off with an easy 35-27 verdict. The 
present Duke array, which affects 
the .professional style of play, are 
without a doubt one of the great­
est teams ever to perform in the 
Tartan Gym and it certainly was 
no disgrace to lose to such a com­
bine.
Dukes Stop Skibos
The Dukes only made one or two 
short shots in the entire game 
which is quite an eloquent descrip­
tion of their sharp-shooting ability. 
In the first half the Red and Blue 
placed three men against Carne­
gie’s two outer zone-keepers and 
always had a deadly marksman in 
the clear. When the Plaid 
switched to a man-for-man de­
fense, Duquesne countered with 
some of the prettiest blocking seen 
in a long while and still kept those 
sharpshooters in the clear.

F.&M. and N.Y.U. Win 
By Close Decisions; 
Miller is Star
It Is certainly tough when a 
team wins five first places in a 
swimming meet and still loses, but 
that is exactly what happened to 
Coach Risedorph’s tankers up at 
N. Y. U. Saturday. The Violets 
scored enough seconds and thirds 
to carry off a 32-27 decision.
Pal Miller, the Tartan free style 
artist, was right in his stride, 
copping both the 50 and the 100 
and helping, to win the relay. 
Boyer won the backstroke with lit­
tle trouble, and Von der Lancken 
brought home the bacon in breast 
stroke. Jerge got a third in the 
440 free style, and Kuhn nabbed a 
third in the diving, but that con­
cluded the scoring for the visiting 
plaid.
On Friday, the Scots lost an­
other close meet when they bowed 
to Franklin and Marshall at Lan­
caster, 35-25. The high point of 
this meet was the duel in the 150- 
yard backstroke event between 
Ranny Boyer, the class of the 
Pittsburgh district, and Gordon 
Chalmers,' a member of the Amer­
ican Olympic squad. Chalmers 
won a close verdict. The Lancas­
ter boy also upset the dope in the 
100-yard free style by beating out 
Pal Mi.ier in a close finish. This 
was Miller’s first setback of the 
season.
It was only a contest for about 
eight minutes, at which time the 
Tartans were in the lead for the 
last time. The steady bombard­
ment of the Blulfites soon took its 
toll and the Plaid were seven 
points in arrears at the intermis­
sion. Throughout the second 
period the Duke tossers continued 
to take aim; ¦ Tech . followers con­
tinue to sigh, and the ball con­
tinued to swisli through the hoop
Skibo Boxers 
Defeated by 
Mountaineers
Carr Beats Neeley in 
Fast Bout; Bucknell 
Here Saturday
West Virginia's classy array of 
mitt ilingers practically cinched the 
Eastern Intercollegiate Boxing 
Conference last Saturday night 
when they decisively defeated 
Ernie Sesto's entries at the Car­
negie gym, 5-2. The Tartans, 
crippled by tho loss of four of their 
more experienced boxers through 
mid-year examinations, were no 
match for the Mountaineers, who 
seem strongly fortified in every 
class except the 115 where they 
have no entry.
Carnegie Tech’s only victory of 
the evening came in the lightweight 
division where Captain Henry Carr 
snared a neat decision over Billy 
Neeley. Neeley was by far the 
toughest opponent Carr has faced 
this year, and the going was fast 
throughout. Hem-y’s long stinging 
left was what ultimately decided 
the issue, for Neeley had no suc­
cess at getting inside of it.
Tom Coulter was further en- 
enlightened as to how gentle the art 
of self defense is when he ran into 
a hard right to button. Payne, a 
classy light-heavyweight from the 
corn liquor state, looked just too 
good.
Jerry O’Toole dropped' a bitter 
decision to Voorhies in the 165- 
pound class. Mr. O’Toole threw a 
copious number of punches, but his 
opponent threw them more effec­
tively and consequently copped the 
verdict.
This Saturday the Skibo boxers 
face Bucknell at the gym. As 
usual, Bucknell has a very smooth 
machine.
until the final count read, Du­
quesne 35, Carnegie 27.
Rally Downs Grovers 
Last Tuesday, the Tartan toss­
ers clicked in the second half of 
the contest with Grove City in a 
manner that brought gratifying 
smiles to Coach Hannum’s face, 
and snowed under a determined 
Crimson outfit, 54-36. Throughout 
the first half the play was extreme­
ly mediocre with both teams 
guilty of much wild shooting and 
poor passing, but after the Skibos 
got the range in the second period 
the contest turned into a rout.
Intramural Pool and Mat Contests;
To Be Held Soon; Entries Called
The Intramural Swimming 
Meets, previously postponed from 
a date last Fall, are to be held on 
April 3, 5, and 7, with the cham­
pionship finals April 10. These 
meets are open to all registered 
students in the day school, except­
ing those who have won points on 
either Plebe or Varsity swimming 
teams during the pas't season. 
This applies to all freshman swim­
mers who have earned points to­
ward their numerals, despite the 
fact that this year the frosh team 
is not, in the usual sense, official. 
One contestant may not enter more 
than two events and the relay. 
Entries for the intramural swim­
ming are due not later than 4:30 
on Friday, March 24.
According to custom, there will 
be a cup awarded to the fraternity, 
dormitory or class that wins the 
greatest number of points. This 
trophy shall be the property of 
that winning organization for the 
ensuing year. Three wins by one 
organization entitles permanent 
ownership of the cup. The swim­
ming trophy was won for the sec­
ond time by the Delta Tau Delta 
fraternity.
A new method of running and 
scoring the intramural swimming 
meets was decided upon last Octo- 
ber by the Student Council,

"Don’t know what it is about Granger,

"Somehow, there’s a flavor and aroma 
about Granger I never found in any other

and good with these big Granger flakes, 
it’s about the coolest smoke I ever 
enjoyed. It makes me downright pipe 
hungry every lime I look at the package.”
Some years ago we made a painstaking,

scientific study to find out, if we could, 
the kind of tobacco best suited for pipes.
Down in the Blue Grass regions of 
Kentucky, we found a tobacco called 
White Burley. There is a grade of this 
tobacco between the kind used for chew­
ing and the varieties suitable for cigarettes 
that is best suited for pipes. This tobacco 
is used in Grander.
This tobacco is prepared by a method 
worked out many years ago by Mr. J. N.
The Granger pouch

Wellman. It gives Granger a fragrance 
and mellowness that pipe smokers like, 
and makes it burn to a clean, dry ash. 
Granger never gums a pipe.
Granger has not been on sale very long, 
but it has come to be popular, and there 
is this much aboui it: We have yet to 
know of a man who started smoking it, 
who didn’t keep on. Folks seem to like it

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN. TUESDAY, MARCH 7. 19333
“Buy Carnegie” 
Plan to Provide 
Work for Many
The “Buy Carnegie” plan, men­
tioned in a previous issue, is gain­
ing headway. The plan is simple 
and easily applicable, and certain­
ly should be adopted by the stu­
dents. The entire idea is as fol­
lows. IE you have any repair work 
of anj' sort, or any work at all, to 
offer around your home or office 
or plant, why not first find whether 
there isn’t a Carnegie man who 
can do the job, before hiring an 
outsider?
Everyone knows that many of 
our fellow students are either un­
employed or nearly so, and they 
are badly in need of gainful occu­
pation. It would be a good thing 
for all of us who have work to of­
fer to contact these students and 
give them a job. uVIany hours of 
work might possibly be obtained 
for the unemployed night men in 
this way. The recompense asked 
for their work will be as reasona­
ble, if not more so, than that asked 
by an outsider. The" employment 
offered may mean the difference 
between paying his own way or 
near-beggary to the student em­
ployed.
We must face the facts of the ef­
fects of the depression honestly. 
Men are unemployed, their sav­
ings are exhausted, and they are, 
in too many cases, too proud to 
ask for aid. Charity has always 
been a bugbear to a man willing to 
work, but unable to gain employ­
ment, and such men are naturally 
shy of public aid.
So, here is your ciiance to help 
break the depression, and to help 
your fellow student. It is not char­
ity, or anythings approaching it. It 
is merely giving our friends, and 
acquaintances at school first crack 
at a job that they can fill as well 
as, if not better than, a chance 
workman hired at random.
Spring time is coming. Our
houses and properties will need
paint, repairs, landscaping, etc.
Let’s all get together and find
some one of our fellow students 
who can and will do the job for us. 
Help your classmates all you can. 
Give them the encouragement they 
need to carry their studies to suc­
cessful completion. Buy Carne­
gie!

Carnegie Honoraries
The Dragons, Carnegie senior 
class honorary society for men 
was founded in 191S as a local 
organization and has retained this 
status ever since, in spite of sev­
eral offers to establish chapters on 
other campuses and to become 
affiliated with national fraternities 
in the same field.
Men from the junior classes of 
the three colleges are called to tlio 
Dragons on Qualifications Day dur­
ing the annual Spring Carnival. 
The requirements for membership 
are integrity of character, qualities 
of leadership, and participation in 
activities.
The purpose of the organization 
is the advancement of all campus 
activities.
This year the society is known 
as the I4tli Dragons since the or­
ganization has been in existence 
14 years. There are ten men who 
are members this year. They are: 
Thomas II. Coulter, president; 
William Lazarus, secretary; John 
L. Kronenberg, treasurer; Janies 
C. Fergus, Ira Kuhn, Robert Robin­
son, Robert Smith. James Stahl, 
John W. Ladd, and Josef L. Lentz.

Kiltie Band Plans 
Several Concerts
The Kiltie Band, under the man­
agement of Fred Ford, is planning 
several concerts to bo given in 
nearby states as well as in Pitts­
burgh. It has arranged coucort 
engagements at the Wilkinburg 
Parent-Teachers’ Association and 
at the Indiana State Teachers’ Col­
lege. It also hones to have an 
engagement in West Virginia and 
to play in a church In Sheridan,

Mr. Beatty in the Employment 
Bureau. Out-of-town graduates 
may secure these forms by writing 
to Mr. Beatty. The mimeographed 
extracts will be ready for distri­
bution one week after each lec­
ture. The last two lectures were 
"Four Fundamentals of Salesman­
ship," and “Pre-approach Knowl­
edge of Your Product."
Two hundred and forty-two of 
the three hundred who attended 
the lecture on February 21 reg­
istered in the 'course. Of those 
who registered, two-liundred and 
one were graduates, twenty-seven 
former students, and fourteon non­
technical men. There were one 
hundred thirty-seven employed 
graduates and sixty-four unemploy­
ed; of the other students thirty- 
four were employed and seven un­
employed, making a total of ono 
hundred seventy-one employed as 
compared to seventy-one unem­
ployed.

ILLUSIAE:
The Oriental girl reclines on a sheet of plate 
glass supported by two slaves. The magician 
waves a white sheet in front of the pretty 
maiden ... pronounces a few magic words ... 
Presto! She has disappeared in thin air.
RX.LAEAOIAE :
“Disappearing” acts are among the most popu­
lar in the repertory of the magician. Dogs, 
horses, girls, whole rooms disappear—whisked 
into wings, dropped through trapdoors, hidden 
by mirrors. But this “disappearance” is a bit 
different. One of the “slaves” is a hollow dummy. 
When the magician holds up the sheet the lithe 
little lady disappears completely—into the con­
venient-figure of the dummy.
GleC ubAc lt ii vttIno 
rrr IlWC ktuSp Finv lt aEts
There is also a trick of cigarette adver­
tising, whereby a few magic words are 
used to create the illusion of “Coolness.” 
RX.LAEAOIAE: Coolness is determined 
by the speed of burning. Fresh cigarettes, 
retaining their full moisture, burn more 
slowly... smoke cooler. Parched, dry ciga­
rettes burn fast.They taste//o/.This makes 
the method of wrapping very important.
Improperly wrapped cigarettes begin to 
dry out as soon as packed.
Camels are cooler because they come 
in the famous Humidor Pack of welded, 
three-ply, MOISTURE-PROOF cello- 
phane ... and because they contain better 
tobaccos.
A cigarette that is fresh, full of natural 
moisture, and blended from choice, ripe 
tobaccos tastes cooler than one that is 
harsh and acrid. For coolness, choose 
a fresh cigarette, made from costlier 
tobaccos.
Finishing touches are being put 
on'the Night College of Engineer­
ing Banquet which will be held 
this Saturday evening in the Ball’ 
Hoorn of the Roosevelt Hotel. So 
that everyone will be accommo­
dated, ticket returns are requested 
by Thursday evening. The officers 
promise a big time for the evening 
.and have left nothing undone to 
assure a successful affair. No en­
gineer will want to miss their an­
nual college banquet and as there 
is still time to make reservation 
“better see one of the salesmen.
There will be a very fine pro­
gram of entertainment starting at 
U:30 p. m. and the cost of the ban- 
-quet, including the plate is only 
one dollar. All your classmates 
will be out.
We get rather impatient these 
•days waiting for the gracious Lady 
Spring to put in her appearance.
Spring not only means new 
•clothes, with their attendant bills, 
It means more interior beauty as 
well as exterior. New wearing ap­
parel brightens and beautifies the 
appearance of humans in much the

•emerges from its long winter’s

tify outwardly. It awakens a sonjs

awakening of Spring. As -warmth 
«reeps into the Winter sunshine, 
so warmth and joy. gradually seep 
into thç hearts of men. Selah.

Keenly aware of the problems of business, large 
and small, Bell System commercial men are con­
stantly devising special telephone plans to custom- 
fit service to the user’s needs.
For example, a plan they worked out for a 
coal distributor helped him to contact 50% more 
dealers. A manufacturer, using a telephone selling 
plan, sold 700 dozen pairs of hosiery through 
one Long Distance call. A great meat packer 
handles complex sales and distribution problems 
efficiently with the aid of planned Long Distance 
and private wire services.
Systematic telephone plans are helping many 
users to build business —cut costs—handle collec­
tions — unify nationwide organizations — increase 
profits. And Bell System men are seeking still 
other ways to make the telephone more useful.

Draws Comments 
From Critics
Well, here we are, all set, ready 
to go . . . you don’t know where 
. . . Why the banquet of course, 
where else. What more important 
iuTair could we engineers go to? 
Yes sir, it’s Saturday evening this 
week at the Roosevelt Hotel, and 
in case you don’t know the time, 
it’s 6:30 p. m. Sure, I’ll be there 
and seeing all my colleagues, con­
sorts, and cohorts, and whoever 
else wants to come. All aboard 
for the big time.
Strange isn’t it, that we should 
have the banquet in a hotel bear­
ing the same name as our newly 
installed president. That is some­
thing of a coincident. Bet our of­
ficers thought of it when they se­
lected the place for the blowout. 
Certainly it's going to be a suc­
cess. Did you ever hear of any­
thing having that name attached 
to it that wasn't? Look at Teddy 
.and all the rest down the line.
There you are, some of us can’t 
he quiet even if we -do have a room 
to ourselves. Guess we’ll have to 
3>ut up sound proof walls in the 
study room to keep the excess 
noise from getting too loud. Glad 
to note that somebody agrees with 
me that the excessive noise—a la 
•conversaion, etc., is bewildering, if 
not distracting, especially if one is 
trying to pinch hit on an assign­
ment; but then, of course, this 
shouldn’t affect me since I don’t 
care much about assignments any­
way.
I noticed from last week's Tar­
tan that somebody thought' that 
.aluminum was intoxicating so a re­
search was made and presto, they 
rfound out that there was nothing 
to it. It’s just like all the other 
fads. All one has to do is say 
something and before you can 
turn around the rest of the world 
¦has your story magnified many 
times. It's funny that, after all 
these years of cooking with alu­
minum, it has finally been decided 
that no ill effects can be produced 
-by using aluminum pots and pans. 
Glad to have the information.
I see that the Exchange number 
¦of- Puppet is scheduled for this week. 
I enjoyed the last number so much 
that I have resolved to become a 
regular subscriber for the remain­
ing numbers. I know somebody 
who is going to be happy now, be­
cause my extra sale will boost the 
•circulation. And, speaking of cir­
culation, guess I better circulate 
-away from this column before I 
get the bell . . . Before I go, 
though, let me say ... See you at 
the banquet at the Roosevelt— Saturday . . . So, so long until 
. . . That was the Idle Night Stu­
dent signing off until this time 
next week. The Tartan bids you 
all good night.
Returns for Eng. 
Banquet Due Thurs
Many impecunious artists are eat­
ing this winter, some of them are 
even taking their overcoats out of 
hock. As a matter of fact, one 
well known night art .student will 
soon be sporting a new gentle­
man’s ensemble and all the feast­
ing and alarming extravagance be­
cause the market for paintings at 
the Associated Artists’ exhibition 
has been exceptionally fertile.
Friends of Pittsburgh arts are 
displaying a wonderful spirit of al­
truism, by their generous patron­
age of the works of local artists. 
More “sold” signs can be seen on 
paintings now than ever before.
Perhaps the fantastic and origi­
nal work at the exhibition is “Res­
urrection Symphony.” It is claim­
ed by its creator, Harry Scheuch 
who is a former Carnegie man, to 
be an interpretation of musical 
form.. While it is obviously an am­
bitious effort, a most distrubing 
Jeature is the hastily constructed 
unpainted face.
Prize Picture Defended
“It's simply atrocious” was the 
comment of one fair embryo art 
lover, while viewing “Interior” by 
Alexander Kostellow. Such re­
marks are typical of the average 
layman, who holds this manner of 
painting in contempt. Neverthe­
less we contend that no other man­
ner could have been employed-to 
more forcefully portray the 
sordidness of poverty; after all 
the conception of every work of 
art carries with it its own rules 
and methods.
Another of M.r. Hilton’s can­
vasses “Graphic Arts” should at­
tract the undivided attention of 
Carnegie Arts Students. It repre­
sents a scene in the printing rooms 
of the P. and D. Department, -with 
the familar figure of Professor 
Warner in the foreground holding 
a copy.
Norwood MacGilvary applies his 
distructive technique to the por­
traiture of an old woman in his 
picture “Dawn.” It reveals the 
fading of woman and many lovely 
girls were observed to srudder at 
its stark realism.
“The Return” by Frances Orr 
affects the emotions unpleasantly. 
Here is a work executed in the 
most delicate tints, yet it lacks ap­
peal, because its emery-cloth like 
surface produces a grating sensa­
tion’on the nerves.
Unusual Subjects Shown
Topsy turvey houses have an 
esthetic appeal to Samuel Rosen­
berg, another Carnegie art instruc­
tor. In “Front Yard, Pittsburgh” 
he simply affirms the truth of the 
old adage that “the complete ar­
tist picks'from what is great and 
what is little, from the clouds in 
the sky to the dunghills in the 
barnyards.”
As was inevitable, the present 
show has its quota of amateur ex­
hibitors. At any rate many works 
impress one as amateurish in con­
ception, design and treatment. 
“North Park” is a striking example 
of this type, and if these are sin­
cere works of art, then one may 
speculate what the countless num­
ber of rejected
Exchange No. of Puppet 
On Sale All This Week
The Exchange number of Puppet 
will be on sale all this week.' From 
a glance at the posters advertising 
this number one should be willing 
to exchange a dime for a copy of 
the magazine. It is about as color­
ful a number as has ever been 
issued. The price of ten cents is 
a very small cost for the college 
humorous magazine. Better see 
your night salesman and secure 
your copy before they are all sold 
out.
Students Invade 
New Occupations
The Industries boys are “Com­
ing Back,” a recent newspaper ar­
ticles indicated. Mingling with a 
few boys last week, it was 
learned that some had acquired 
new occupations and some had 
been urged, through lack of former 
employment, to start in business 
for themselves. For instance: a 
former electrician is now paper- 
hanging, and a fewr electricians 
who -were formerly employed by 
contractors are now contracting 
for themselves. A former clerk 
has turned salesman—brush sales­
man—and several furnace repair­
men are fortunately. finding jobs 
in that line. The automobile me­
chanics report that they are kept 
busy, especially during the cold 
weather. A very good-looking 
draftsman has recently obtained 
a much coveted position as mana­
ger of a chain store. Incidentally 
none have taken to farming. But 
it’s early yet; maybe many are 
waiting until the close of school.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT going to night school 
isn’t as bad as it might be . . . 
there's always something hap­
pening if you are not too uncon­
scious to see it . . . everything 
from banquets to brawls . . . 
and from romance to . . .
THAT those Friday night 
gatherings in the corridor out­
side the Council office always 
finds an arts lassie in the mid­
dle of the mad mob. The witty 
gems that emanate from this 
group would make the Fire 
Chief die with envy.
THAT the budding romance 
of that Industries boy and girl 
seems to be at a temporary 
standstill. Conserving energy 
for the big drive, 1 guess.
THAT one of our writing 
brethren is keeping away from 
cigarets these days and now 
sports a six-inch fag holder.
THAT the engineers are in 
the process of ballyhooing their 
banquet and are succeeding 
quite well, thank you.
THAT we’re warning yous 
gals and yous fellars that some 
big news is going to break on 
this sheet soon, keep your op­
tics open for it.
THAT that’s that and I’ll be 
seenya.

The Arts Ball Situation
The Student Council’s action last Tuesday which elimin­
ated the Arts Ball from the social calendar of the Council is no 
surprise.
For some weeks the Arts Ball Committee preferred to dis­
regard certain powers of the Council given to it by the Execu-, 
tive Board of Carnegie, as well as to disregard suggestions from 
the Council about certain businesses. There was ample, oppor­
tunity for certain members of the committee who are members 
of the Council to appeal to the Council for consideration of any 
cases they might have or exceptions to the Council’s rulings 
they might desire. Despite the fact that the committee was in­
formed of the powers of the council several weeks in advance 
of the Ball, and despite the fact such matters of disagreement 
which arose could have been amicably settled on the floor of 
the Council, as well as any other so-called misunderstandings 
corrected, the committee preferred to be independent and de­
fiant to the Council and to assert its usurped authority by send­
ing insulting letters on the eve of the Ball to several students 
who were supposedly to have received complimentary tickets 
to the Ball by a Student Council ruling. As a matter of fact, 
the letters were discriminatingly sent and one person who 
should have received a letter did not and one student whose 
name is not on the Council’s list did receive one, showing that 
the powers directing the committee’s action were ignorant of 
facts.
The matter of the letters is incidental to the general atti­
tude of several members of the committee toward Student 
Council, or rather toward several members of the Council. It 
has been revealed that the sending of the letters had been care­
fully planned by a few members of the committee several weeks 
in advance and that it was not until the day before the dance 
that the action was approved by the committee as a whole.
The incompetence of the committee is further revealed in 
its list of recommendations, which in reality are admittances of 
deficiencies in performances of duties at the Ball.
The arts students are absolutely right in demanding the 
Ball be a closed affair, biit if such is to be the status, why is 
it that there were a number of non-arts students attending the 
dance? A certain member of the committee even went so far 
as to tell an arts girl that she could bring anyone whom she 
desired and arrangements could be made for liis admittance, 
According to the contents of the letters sent, the exclusiveness 
of the affair is the sole basis for their being sent. This does not 
seem consistent. It is apparent that certain members of the 
committee were misled by misconceptions and groundless 
rumors which have caused the entire committee to he entangled 
in this most disagreeable matter.
'Phe blame for the committee’s negligence and mishandling 
of affairs cannot be placed entirely upon the shoulders of the 
chairman, but there is no excuse for anyone on the committee 
not knowing about the affairs of the Council, since three mem­
bers of the committee arc members of the Council and had re­
ceived instructions about the correct procedures which should 
have been followed.
It is hard to sec why the Arts Ball Committee should as­
sume certain authorities when other groups in the school arc 
prevented by tho Council’s constitution, which was amended 
to its present form four years ago, from exercising any such 
authority. The Council is a representative group of students 
selected from the entire student body and it would be a weak­
ness on the part of the Council not to preserve school unity 
and understanding. The independence of the Arts Ball Com­
mittee is not in keeping with school unity.
The fairness of the Council towards the arts students is 
evidenced in the stipulation in the suspending motion which 
will consider a petition for re-instatement if it is signed by 300 
arts students. The actions of several members of the commit­
tee should certainly not reflect upon all of the arts students be­
cause the greatest majority of the students knew nothing of 
the committee’s actions. It is very seldom that the arts stu­
dents as a group are not willing to co-operate with the Student 
Council.
More Honor to Carnegie!
Class “A” design architectural student's from all parts of 
the nation submitted their work a few months ago to two criti­
cal preliminaries for the Paris Prize, considered to be the high­
est award an architectural student can receive in this countiy. 
Of the eight who emerged successfully from these tests three 
were graduates from Carnegie.
It is a remarkable and a rare case when an architectural 
school can claim as its graduates such a large percentage of the 
finalists for this award. Carnegie should feel honored that its 
school of architecture trained three of thé finest architectural 
students in the country.
BOOK REVIEW
By MARGARET VARNER
Elizabeth Moorhead, author of 
Clouded Hills and Answer Before 
Dark, lias recently published a 
third work, The Forbidden Tree. 
Miss Moorhead, better known at 
Carnegie as Mrs. Vermoroken, was 
born in Pittsburgh and taught in 
the Carnegie Department of Eug- 
lish from 1911 to 1927.
In her very direct, almost vigor­
ous manner, sho has developed iier 
new novel in a setting which, for 
its similarity in every detail, might 
have heen drawn from the Car­
negie campus. Tho plot is based 
on tho struggles of Charles May­
nard, a promising young British in­
structor, and a true romanticist, 
and what he believed to be an un­
balanced world. From a long line 
of New England teachers, writers, 
and preachers, Charles inherits 
the birthright of being a scholar, 
and the desire of searching for 
truth and beauty. In contrast with 
this part of his nature there is 
that which demands worldly, phys­
ical indulgence. This conflicting 
make-up finds expression in his 
genuine affection for Janet Ware, 
his bewildering passion for Mirella 
Berger, and his unanswered love 
for lovely Fanny Remington.
Janet, a very loyal and efficient 
little teacher in the same depart­
ment, stands as the balancing fac­
tor in his life. In her are realized 
all the goodness and fineness of a 
simple understanding woman, but 
her fair and practical judgment 
proves that nothing but friendship 
can exist between them. Mirella 
Berger, a pupil of Charles’, by her 
pale wisdom and subtle physical 
attraction, touches a strain in his 
Innermost life to which ho cannot 
rosist response, but his conscience 
does not permit this relationship 
to live. Her decreasing attraction 
for Charles and her own very com­
plex nature prompts Mirella to 
commit suicide.
Charles wavers from his purpose 
in living, from his symbol — the 
budding staff. Betrayed friendship 
and disillusionment, make him lose 
sight of his real goal, but not until 
he meets Fanny Remington does 
he realize this. Fanny, in spite of 
her wealth, asks nothing of life but 
sunlight, honesty, and nature. She 
loves In Charles his eagerness to 
grow, his homely virtues, but he 
is dazzled by her glamor, the ex­
travagance of her life. He at­
tempts to be what lie is not, and, 
in doing so, loses Fanny’s love. He 
then realizes that he has touched 
the forbidden tree, has sunered, 
but in his suffering has found 
beauty, simplicity, and truth.
Arts Ball Is Abolished by
Student Council Action
Action Results From Failure of Committee To Co­
operate With Council; 300 Arts Students 
May Petition For Re-instatement
CContlnued From Page One.) 
one occasion before where they aid 
receive the tickets, it was scarcely 
precedence enough. We merely 
acted under courtesy in sending 
letters - to Council members, ex­
plaining the attitude of the Com­
mittee.
There was a doubt upon the 
part of Council members as to the 
term “courtes^” as used by Mr. 
Dietz.
Mr. Dietz further said that the 
letters were not intended to keep 
the Council away from the Ball.
Thomas Ryder '33, a member of 
the committee and, also, of Stu­
dent Council, stated that in the 
letters which the Committee sent 
out, there was not a single clause 
which doubted the supremacy of 
the Council. "They did not say 
that they would not honor the 
tickets,” he added.
He was asked by William 
Lazarus ’33, why did not all mem­
bers of Council who should have, 
receive letters, while some of the 
other students, not on the Council, 
received them.
President Lentz then requested 
that the secretary read one of the 
letters. Following the reading he 
said, “There is a rule on the min­
utes of the Council of 1929 regulat­
ing the number of complimentary 
tickets to be issued to the Council, 
and to whom they should be given.”
Mr. Dietz stated that the Com­
mittee was in absolute ignorance 
of the motion passed by Student 
Council in 1929.
Mr. Ryder supplemented his 
other remarks: .‘‘In the case of
the last Arts Ball, the. Student 
Council was not given tickets until 
very shortly before the Ball. This 
was why it was not felt necessary 
to send the letters until the last 
minute, so that they were received 
on the morning before the Ball 
was held.”
According to the recipients of 
the letters, they were not received 
until the afternoon preceding- or 
the morning of, the Ball.
Mr. Ryder continued, “The Com­
mittee still did not feel that any 
members of Student Council, ex­
cept the President and the Social 
Chairman, should be given compli­
mentary tickets on the grounds of 
nothing but precedence.”
At this point Mr. Rollin V. Davis, 
executive secretary of the Student 
Council interrupted Mr. Ryder.
Mr. Davis asked, “Did you not 
come into my oflice some days be­
fore the Ball, and did I not at that 
time instruct you fully concerning 
the powers of Student Council and 
the matter of the complimentary 
tickets?”
Mr. Ryder—“Well, -------
Mr. Davis repeated his question.
Mr. Ryder—“Well, I guess I did.”
Mr. Lazarus charged that Dean 
Green understood that the Arts 
Ball Committee was not to receive 
complimentary tickets, but the 
names of the entire committee ap­
peared on the list of names of peo­
ple to be admitted free.
Mr. Dietz replied that Dean 
Green had been told no such thing.
John Kronenberg '33, treasurer 
of the Council, was given the lloor. 
“Council was not told anything 
about the comps.,” he said. “Dean 
Green told me that he understood 
that the Committee members were 
not getting complimentary tickets, 
yet they were given 20 unauthor­
ized tickets. They were the only 
unauthorized tickets given out for 
years.”
Mr. Dietz replied that the Com­
mittee was admitted by a list of 
invited guests. He said that he 
had no knowledge that the Coun­
cil should approve the compli­
mentary list.
President Lentz in reply to Mr. 
Dietz’s ignorance of the Council’s 
authority said, “There is no rea­
son for anyone on the Student 
Council to be unaware of the busi­
ness of the Council.” Three mem­
bers of the Committee are mem­
bers of the Council. “The com­
mittee should have asked for an 
explanation of anything that they 
did not know about,” he continued. 
“By the motion passed by Student 
Council in 1929, the President, 
Executive Secretary, Chairman of 
the Social Committee, and the 
editor of the Tartan were to be 
given complimentary tickets. The 
Treasurer of the Council was 
added to this list the following 
year. In 1929 the Executive Board
put the power over all non-athletic 
organizations in the Student Coun­
cil.” The editor of the Tartan is 
not necessarily a member of Stu­
dent Council.
Mr. Dietz replied that he did not 
know that anything had been 
changed. “I took everything as it 
stood in this year’s White Book 
for granted,” he said.
Mr. Kronenberg replied to Mr. 
Dietz. “The Arts Ball Committee, 
he said, “had been told by Mr. 
Davis what the Student Council’s 
powers are. They preferred to 
take a chance on the basis of the 
statement in the White Book. Mr. 
Lazarus added that there were 
three members of the Committee 
on the Council and that they 
should have told Mj\ Dietz of his 
duties.
In reply to Mr. Dietz’s state­
ment “that enough time has been 
spent on these details and that if 
there is anything else in which we 
are really wrong, I am ready to 
make an apology,” President Lentz 
said that the preceding incidents 
were not details and that the busi­
ness was a matter of correct pro­
cedure.
Mr. Kronenberg further 
marked that “the Committee was 
fully notified of the powers of Stu­
dent Council and the ruling with 
regard to the complimentary tick­
ets.” He remarked, “In order to 
nullify the Student Council’s rul­
ing, they sent the letters.”
Mr. Dietz replied that Student 
Council would have been sorry if 
they had come. “It was only po­
liteness on our part,” he added, 
“to inform them that their presence 
would not be desired by the Arts 
School body.”
Mr. Kuhn objected to Mr. Dietz’s 
use of the word “polite.” “The 
letters were sent the last day,” he 
said. “The fellows had made their 
dates, and the girls had made 
their costumes. Then the letters 
were received. They really said: 
No, don’t attend.”
Another member of the Council 
stated that the Council had made 
every effort to co-operate with the 
Committee, even going so far as 
to allow the committee to have the 
checking confessions, which by all 
rights belonged to two students on 
the Council who had petitioned for 
all checking concessions at the be­
ginning of the year. After con­
siderable discussion, during which 
Mr. Ryder charged that the peti­
tion presented to Council at the 
beginning of the year was not the 
same as read at the meeting and 
that the petition read at Tuesday’s 
meeting was signed by Mr. Kron­
enberg instead of the two petition­
ing students. Mr. Kronenberg 
stated that he was authorized to 
sign the petition by the two stu­
dents, whereupon Mr. Ryder said 
that the petition was no good if it 
was not signed by the petitioning 
parties. The two students who 
had petitioned for the concessions 
were not present and further dis­
cussion was declared out of order.
Arts Ball Committee 
Recommendations
Following are tlie recommenda­
tions of the Arts Ball Committee 
to future committees:
(a) That there be a better un­
derstanding of the relationship of 
the Committee and tho Student 
Council and a clear cut statement 
concerning the powers of both 
groups in the management of the 
Ball.
(b) That as the Committee 
needed all revenue possible for 
successful budget, the checking 
concession for both the Ball and 
the Post Arts Ball should be in the 
hands of the Committee.
(c) C o m p 1 i m e n tary tickets 
should be available for the Com­
mittee to give to those who sell a 
certain number of tickets to the 
Ball, say fifteen, and that the Com 
mittee should have entire control 
of the issuance of complimentary 
tickets, giving the Dean of the 
Arts College the privilege of invit­
ing four guests, who would secure 
admission on his letter of invitation 
and not by complimentary ticket.
Other points brought out in the 
discussion, and agreed upon as be­
ing items needing correction for 
the next function, were as follows:
(a) That a guard be placed in 
the Men’s room in the basement of 
the North entrance. This was the 
only room that had to be open 
throughout the evening and per­
sons secured access to the build-

IN THE BIG CITY—
Stories are still floating around about how the 
boys passed their time in the quiet little village 
of New York during the recent basketball trip 
through the East.
Brad Edelblut probably furnished the razzers 
with more good material than the rest when he 
blew himself to a brand new combination foun­
tain pen and pencil combined. Walking down 
Broadway, he and a couple of the boys 
stopped to 
watch an auc­
tion sale. After 
they’d been in 
a couple of 
minutes, the 
auctioneer put 
up a beautiful 
chrome silver 
fountain pen 
and pencil.
Bidding was extremely lively and the price soon 
got up to 51.40. Our modest hero never dreamed 
when he raised it to the even. 119.1 f that bidding 
would cease and he would be awarded the'cov­
eted combination which bore a price tag of eight 
dollars, but the auctioneer had taken a liking to 
Brad and the second he got the final bid out 
of his mouth the word “SOLD!” reverberated 
through the store.
The other boys found other ways of passing 
the time. Jimmy Fergus had his tea leaves read 
and was so satisfied by the results that he con­
sented to have his palm read as well. Just what 
the results were Jimmy is keeping to himself. 
Lou Jagnow and Bobby Smith did the conven­
tional and went to the Hollywood Restaurant and 
both are now authorities on why the orange juice 
people haven’t felt the depression.
It remained, however, for little “Mo” Silver­
man to pull a real fast one on the city slickers. 
Badly in need of a haircut, “Mo”stepped out of 
the hotel and into the station (where the price 
was a nickle lower) to furnish the barber shop 
a little business. The barber was rather a talka­
tive fellow and since young Mister Silverman is 
no slouch himself, words flowed freely. Time 
passed and eventually the job was completed. If 
you can imagine “Mo’s” eyes almost popping out 
of his head, that’s just what happened when he 
saw the bill, well over four dollars. He’d got­
ten the whole works. Everything known to the 
trade had been administered during his stay in 
the chair and the man wanted money for it. He 
got the thirty-five cents for the haircut, but there 
the story ends.+ * * 9 »
ABOUT THE CAMPUS—
Claims to the title of the “World's Most Ab­
sent Minded Pledge” are being made for Bob 
Potter by the entire active chapter at the Phi Psi 
House. His prize stunt was pulled the other 
night when he was sent out to post a couple of 
letters and buy some Eskimo pies. On his way 
back from purchasing the pies lie stopped at the 
mail box, dropped in the pies, and returned, giv­
ing the letters to the actives that had wanted 
something to eat. If you can beat that let us 
know.

Before we get too far away from athletic trips
we should mention the fact that when the rifle
team made its recent trip to Annapolis each of 
four members of the squad had a note for a cer­
tain Midshipman. One also carried the insignia
formerly displayed on one of Carnegie’s fair co­
ed’s coat. Anchors away!*****
At last it’s happened! The other day when 
Carnegie’s famous Bill Pfouts was walking down 
Woodlawn avenue a freshman greeted him with 
a “How do doo, Professor Geckler.” *****
Pal Miller had a most unusual surprise the 
other day in the inn when be came across a wed­
ding ring that had been lost for several days. He 
says it’s his first experience of that nature. *****
SOCIALLY SPEAKING—
Thistle Hall was the scene of two more dances 
in the present winter series. Friday, the Vir­
ginians, who many proclaim the best orchestra of 
the season, furnished the music for those who 
wished to dance away their blues following the 
Duquesne basketball game. We saw that couple 
that traded coats for the journey home. Attend­
ance dropped somewhat because of thq P. C. W. 
Junior Prom and the Pitt Freshman, dance. *****
Saturday night Billy Weixel and his famous 
band made music after the boxing bojits while 
the formal bedecked eds and co-eds tripped the 
light fantastic. The Clark sisters, Daisy and 
Susy, presented quite a problem to the admiring 
males. No one could tell them apart unless they 
were side by side.*****
Thistle Hall wasn’t quite the same, however, 
because the PI K. A. boys were all absent. It 
was the night when the embryo Pi K. A.’s 
(pledges to you) gave their annual kid party. 
After a full week of elaborate preparation, the 
evening ran off smoothly with everyone doing a 
reversal of form and being childish in an un- 
childish way. Hither and yon were groups play­
ing jacks, turning somersaults, etc., etc. Sailor- 
suited boys and rosy-cheeked, hare-kneed girlies 
wandered about lithping in awe at some of Dr. 
Seuss’ animals (a la Pi K. A.) reposed upon the 
much-ornamented walls. One loyal Carnegian, 
^ver thinking of the dear Alma Mater, attended 
in plaid rompers, and once was seen dancing 
with two girls at once! Phi Kaps Boyle, Keller, 
Bernardi, and Flaherty crashed the gate, and in 
costume at that. One brother even wore diapers, 
and lanky Wally Hamilton did a Bunky Hill, Jr. 
with infinite finesse. Incidentally, one pledge has 
the nickname “Red,” and his hair is distinctly 
brown. Could it be that a P. & D. plebe is 
responsible for this?" You guess.*****
THE LAST WORD—
Bill and Robby finally got back from that trip 
of theirs. The model “T” that was to furnish 
them transportation blew up just before they got 
to Florida and Ira Kuhn blew up just after they 
got back. The 
Puppets lead­
ing funsters 
and ear to the 
grounders re­
turned with 
an elaborately 
wrapped pack­
age bearing a suitable 
i n scription
which they proceeded to present to Ira at Dra­
gon meeting. All members were sworn to se­
crecy and made to promise never to reveal the 
contents of the package. Someone told us the 
present was a cactus leaf. We can’t quite get 
any connection.
ing through it by some one keep­
ing the window unlocked for this 
purpose. Other unauthorized en­
trances were made by the front 
door, which was lifted off its hinges 
towards the end of the da.nce.
Ob) A telephone must be made 
available.
(c) The corridor connecting 
the two ends of the mezzanine floor 
•should be shut off to prevent inter­
ference with the electrician.
(d) Plans for refreshments 
were not satisfactory this year, 
largely because the man recom­
mended by Mr. Miller was not cap­
able and the food supply was not 
sufficient.
Ce) The north basement door 
was not closed at twelve midnight, 
as required by the agreement, nor 
was the entire door situation well 
handled. Professor Keeble recom­
mends for next year that the Com­
mittee organize itself into three 
shifts, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, each shift 
to stand by the door and challenge 
any person ineligible for entrance 
or whose costume is not approved.
(f) Professor Keeble also rec­
ommends that the construction 
committee should meet with him 
well in advance of the event so 
that the scheme of decoration 
could be more carefully worked 
out, especially with reference to 
'blocking off forbidden areas and 
masking the class room doors on the 
corridor at the last moment. He 
felt that the whole problem of dec­
oration, especially with relation to 
inflammability, must be faced more 
seriously.
(g) Smoking regulations were 
not observed.
(h) Ventilation of the main cor­
ridor, for dancing, was insufficient. 
The false ceiling, used for the first 
time for this Ball, was largely re­
sponsible.
(i) A combination ticket and 
identification tag to be developed.
No tag was used at the ball and its 
use was stipulated in the agree­
ment between faculty and students.
(j) The other police officers 
should not have accompanied the 
one who was hired.
(k) Newspaper men and women 
were kept out.
(1) People were admitted with­
out costume.
(m) The mimeograph instruc­
tions issued in advance to those 
who were to be present were not 
elaborate enough, nor were they 
signed.
February 27, 1033.My dear Mr. Lentz:
It. has been called to my attention that in the recent report of the Arts Ball Com­mittee, certain statement« were made con­cerning the serving of the refreshments 
which were not In accordance with the 
facts. May I therefore take this opportu­nity of epxlaining this matter to the Stu­dent Council, through you.
1—"* * * the man recommended 
by Mr. Miller was not competent."The man in dueBtion, Mr. E. R. Scs- kus, has been employed by our Dining 
Room Department! when there have 
been unusually large jrroupa to servo (i. e. Y. M. C. A. Banquet) and has complete charge-of the waiters. His work has always been most satisfac­
tory. He, in turn, was recommended to the Dining Room Department by our Employment Office as the most competent student employe for this type of work, -on file.
2—“* c * the food supply was not sufficient.”
This stateniont is absolutely incor­
rect insofar as it concerns the amount 
of food sent to the Arts Building from the Cafeteria. The Committee request­ed that refreshments for 300 be sent over, actually there wer 342 servings supplied.
The arrangements with the Arts Ball Committee was that the Dining Room De­
partment would provide refreshments only 
and was to be in no way responsible for serving. One‘’student waiter only was 
suggested but not employed by the writer 
—the rest were selected by the Arts Ball Committee.The failure to provide refreshments to 
all guests was, without doubt; due to fa­
voritism shown by waiters and their utter lack of responsibility for the safety of the food supplies.
Yours very truly,
L. H. MILLER.

Prof. Lawler 
Add resses Pi 
Delta Epsilon
Valve of Extracurricular 
Activities is Topic 
Of Speech
Participation in publications as 
part of tho extra curricular activi­
ties of a student helps to make a 
college education complete enough 
to make good its major premise: 
the fitting of students for life. This 
was the theme of an address de­
livered by Prof. Leo T. Lawler, at 
a meeting of Pi Delta Epsilon, 
men’s journalistic honorary. This 
meeting, held at the Pi Kappa Al­
pha House, Sunday, February 26, 
was in the form of a smoker for 
all men interested in publications 
work.
Prof. Lawler used student gov­
ernment to illustrate concretely 
the training a student is given by­
activities. "Here students learn, 
or ought to learn, the value of the 
vote, the ballot. If they are eleo- 
ed to office, they ought to learn 
what -it is to be responsible to a. 
constituency, to acquaint them­
selves with the duties of that of­
fice, to practice the civic virtues 
of honesty and loyalty to the cause 
they serve, to use their best abili­
ties in achieving the ends for 
which the office was created.” In 
a like manner these principles may 
be applied to publications.
Maladjustment occurs in activi­
ties as well as in life. A student 
may not be fitted for an activity; 
he may have no interest in it. Con­
sider for example, the student who 
enters publication work merely be­
cause fraternity brothers urge him.. 
College publications which can af­
ford a student unlimited opportuni­
ties, therefore, attract a student 
who has none of the interests or 
abilities which these publications 
need. “If he continues in the ac­
tivity, his interest and anthusiasm 
come from the brothers who prom­
ise to see him through, and he 
learns the very unfortunate lesson 
that his mediocrity will triumph 
if he is united with the right or­
ganization."
On the other hand, If a student 
enters publications work because 
it interests him, he learns to ob­
serve more carefully; his wits are 
sharpened. Correctness, and ex­
pression are incorporated into his 
writing. “The slow hunt for the 
methods of language composition 
will lead eventually to the mastei's, 
the classics; and the study of 
these will not only provide the de­
vices for expressing ideas, but also- 
in many cases, give the ideas.”

developed in more experienced 
members on publications staff,,

learn and believe in your youth,

be in a position to make.’'

^ERE’S a college tradition that’s one of the? 
best . . . “Half past eight is the time to tele­
phone home!” It’s not in the Freshman handbook; 
it’s not in the Rules. But here’s the reason for its-

At 8:30 P. M. low Night Rates go into effect on Sta­
tion to Station calls. These are calls for a telephone: 
(like a local call) and NOT for a specific person.
Take advantage of the saving—just give the operar 
your home telephone number. The folks are prob 
ably at home at 8:30 P. M. But best of all, and t 
make doubly sure, keep a regular date to telephone- 
home each week. Then you can always make use of 
the inexpensive Station to Station service.
