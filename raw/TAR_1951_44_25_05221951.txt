Orchestra, Chorus 
Present Concert 
Tuesday, May 29
A 65 voice chorus and a 75 
piece orchestra of Carnegie Tech’s 
department of music will combine 
to present a concert in Carnegie 
Music Hall Tuesday, May 29, at 
8:30 p.m. Conducting the chorus 
and orchestra will be Mr. Roland
F. Leich, assistant professor of 
music, and Joseph Stecko, a grad­
uate student.
The program will open with 
•‘Dona Nobis Pacem,” by Williams, 
with J. Frederick Gentry and Suz­
anne White, as the solosits. The 
text from this contata includes ex­
cerpts from the Bible and from 
Walt Whitman’s “Drum Taps.”
The chorus and orchestra will 
also play for the first time “O 
Light Invisible.” The text for this 
number was taken from T. S. 
Eliot’s religious pageant “The 
Rock,” by the conductor Roland 
Leich. Mary Ann Kostelnock will 
play the first movement from 
Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1 
in C Major. The program will con­
clude with Elgar’s “Enigma Var­
iations.”
The student concert is open to 
the public, although tickets—free 
upon request—must be secured be­
forehand from the music depart­
ment office.

Robert Levy, a junior printing major, has been elected to suc­
ceed Pete West as editor of Carnegie Tech’s yearbook, the Thistle. 
Bob, who was .layout editor for last year’s Thistle, is also a member 
of Dorm Council, the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and Alpha
Phi Omega.

National Science 
Group Honors 
Dr. F. D. Rossini
Doctor Frederick D. Rdssini, 
professor and head of the depart­
ment of chemistry at Carnegie 
Tech, has been elected to the Na­
tional Academy of Sciences, a 
leading scientific organization with 
total national membership limited 
to about 450.
Besides heading the chemistry 
department, Doctor Rossini is di­
rector of the petroleum research 
laboratory, which is engaged in 
distilling crude oil and its various 
chemical parts. This is the only 
project of its kind in existence and 
makes Carnegie Tech the world 
center for fundamental research in 
crude oil.
Doctor Rossini becomes the third 
National Academy of Sciences 
member in Western Pennsylvania, 
the 14th in the state, and is the 
first alumnus of Carnegie Tech to 
gain this honor.
script editor; James McCune, 
sports editor, and Wallace Hurky, 
layout editor. The art editor and 
seniors editor have not yet been 
appointed. Staff members, espe­
cially typists, for next year’s staff 
are also needed.
Next Issue Started 
The new staff is already work­
ing towards next year’s Thistle. 
Plans are being considered to add 
new interest to the book for pur­
pose of getting away from the 
repetition that is common to most 
yearbooks. Furthermore, the staff 
plans to get subscriptions for 1500 
yearbooks next year, in spite of 
the anticipated decrease in enroll­
ment due to the current man­
power needs. This is 100 more 
subscriptions than the 1400 sold 
this year.
Early Photographs 
Next year’s plans, however, 
should not overshadow this year’s 
issue. The 1951 issue, which 
should be out Friday or Satur­
day, is the Golden Anniversary 
issue and is larger than any other 
Thistle ever published. The first 
section features old pictures from 
1900 on, so that an impression of 
a 1906 Thistle is made.
Since the Thistle is going to be 
out on time this year, it has been 
announced that all copies that 
have been purchased must be 
claimed by June 15. There will 
also be 100 extra copies for any­
one who has not yet purchased 
one.
New Members Installed, Officers Elected;
Davidson Will Head IS ext Council Program
By Larry Glavin
The last meeting of Student Council was highlighted by the 
installation of new members, election of officers, and the resignation 
of 11 members who had an excess of absences. Council also passed 
an amendment to its constitution calling for the reduction of its 
membership. ? ~

Baron Elliott 
At Senior Ball
Dance In Carnegie Hall 
On June 13 For $2
Baron Elliott and his 12 piece 
orchestra will provide the music 
when the seniors dance together 
for the last time as a class on June 
13, immediately following the Bac­
calaureate ceremony.
From 9 to 12 p.m. all students 
receiving degrees at commence­
ment will congregate in the foyer 
of the Carnegie Music Hall for the 
informal dance. Featured with El­
liott will be vocalist Jimmy Con­
fers.
Tickets can be purchased at 
$2.00 per couple every day while 
procuring commencement invita­
tions at the Registrar’s Office, or in 
Skibo during the lunch hours.
Parents of the graduates will be 
admitted free of charge, according 
to Wes Apple, junior class presi­
dent,» who is in charge of the 
dance. The dance is being spon­
sored this year by the junior class 
with the hope that it will become 
a traditional project.
Mortar Board pledges are assist­
ing the group by selling tickets.
Paul Stettler, former president 
of Student Council, presented his 
farewell message, in which he 
recommended that in the future 
Council should attempt to take 
preventive rather than curative 
measures. Advising closer atten­
tion to unexcused absences and 
the elimination of blanket excuses 
from meetings, he suggested that 
Council assign special jobs to 
qualified members of the student 
body, thereby obtaining closer 
contact with the students and also 
increasing the efficiency of Coun­
cil. Concluding, he proposed that 
up to date copies of the constitu­
tion and by-laws of Council be 
prepared and made available to 
members and the student body.
Requests Resignations 
Following his address, Stettler 
exploded a bombshell by invoking 
for the first time in many years 
the clause in the constitution of 
Student Council calling for the 
resignation of those members who 
had three or more unexcused ab­
sences. He asked for and received 
the resignations of the following 
members: Trudy Albright, Har­
old Hunt, George Lang, Emerson 
Pugh, Nancy MacDougall, Pat 
Snedden, Paul Stettler, Carol Wil­
son, and A1 Rider.
After the resignations had been 
accepted, Stettler turned the 
chairmanship over to Len Hvizdos, 
formerly Council vice president. 
Hvizdos continued with the new 
business, which included the pro­
posed amendment to reduce the 
size of Council. After much heat­
ed discussion, the amendment was 
passed.
Text of Amendment 
It consists of three parts and 
reads as follows: “Each officially
recognized college (E&S, FA, and 
MMCC) shall have one voting 
member on Council for every 200, 
or major portior thereof, full time, 
undergraduate day students en­
rolled. The presidents of all class 
organizations (freshman, sopho­
more, junior and senior classes) 
shall be included as non-voting 
members of Council. There shall 
be a minimum of 12 members on 
Council not including the presi­
dents of the class organizations.” 
This amendment, to be official, 
must now be passed by a vote of 
two-thirds of the members pres­
ent at a general assembly. It is 
then subject to the approval of 
the Executive Board of CIT.
Will Increase Efficiency 
The amendment is an attempt 
to increase the effectiveness and 
efficiency of Council. Further­
more, it will provide closer co­
ordination between SC and class 
organizations by requiring the at­
tendance of the class presidents. 
The last clause is designed to take

Bill Wayman New Scot Editor; 
Constitution Still Not Approved
The Scot, Carnegie Tech’s variety magazine, has announced the 
elections of a new editorial board for next year. According to the 
new editor, Bill Wayman, the constitution of the organization has 
not bee» approved by Student Council or the school administration. 
Until that is done, he can make*--------------——-------------------------------
no definite statement about the 
policy for the coming year.
The 1951-52 staff includes:
Bill Wayman, editor; George 
Good, Cal Cruder, business man­
agers; Margie Rex, Alan Rider, 
feature editors; Nancy Callaway, 
managing editor; Richard Whit­
son, art editor; Paul Grafius, lay­
out editor; Richard Kendrick, cir­
culation manager; Richard Young, 
advertising manager; Sally Ward, 
Louanne Barberie, fashions; and 
Dolly Mitchell, personnel man­
ager. The positions of publicity 
manager and technical advisor 
have not been filled as yet.
Successful Year 
Under the editorship of Jim 
Alemany, the Scot has completed
a fairly successful year. They had 
one unfortunate issue which was 
banned by thr* Dean’s office be­
cause of a libelous article. Other­
wise the sales of the magazine 
have been very good, with a com­
plete sell-out on several issues.
Many successful changes were 
introduced by the editorial staff 
this year. The 8^4 x 11 size was 
introduced after the pocket-book 
size of the previous year was un­
successful. More cartoons and 
humorous art work were devel­
oped into outstanding features of 
the variety magazine.

Editorials—
A W orld Wide Problem
The student opinion polls conducted recently on campus 
concerning the MacArthur question point up a grave defi­
ciency in the educational development of some students. 
These students, fortunately a minority in the survey, seem­
ed to lack any clear understanding of the basic issues in­
volved in the Korean stalemate.
An article in a late issue of the “Pitt News,” mentioned 
elsewhere on this page, describes Carnegie students as being 
“the kind of guys who can manipulate a slide rule like nobody’s 
business but who never . heard of the United Nations . . . 
or any other heretical ideas. In the majority of cases this criti­
cism is entirely unfounded. But, unfortunately, there remains 
that minority which reads “Smiling Jack” and the sports page 
and then consigns the evening paper to the bottom of the basket.
Those who ignore the important national and interna­
tional issues of the day are defeating the very purpose of 
education—and especially of education as exemplified by the 
Carnegie Plan. Not only that, but the preservation of our 
democracy depends as much on an informed, thinking public 
as it does on electronic computers and productive capacity.
Though students must, of necessity, be concerned with 
their academic persuits, there is always time to stay reason­
ably well informed on current problems. Ivory towers went J 
out of vogue with the atom bomb.
The Proof Of The Pudding . . .
Now that the passage of time has allowed the smoke to 
clear on the late Dr. Doherty’s policy of athletic “de-em­
phasis,” students are beginning to realize the merits of the 
program. Carnegie’s athletic teams of the past year, play­
ing opponents of comparable size and ability, have demon­
strated that winning ways can be maintained despite rug­
ged academic schedules.
The track and football teams, especially, have given Car­
negie supporters much to cheer about this year. Boasting a 7-1 
record in football and a track team undefeated in the regular 
season’s competition, Tech has proved that athletic scholarships 
and free-riding muscle men aren't essential to successful inter­
collegiate athletics.
This new view toward the problem of commercialized 
athletics, plus an expanded and improved intramural pro­
gram, has placed Tech in an enviable position with regard 
to those schools where education appears to have taken a 
, back seat to high-powTered athletics.
Orchids To APO
With all the talk about the decline of activities, we may 
be prone to neglect credit where credit is due. Such a case 
is APO, national scouting honorary.
APO is one honorary in which service to the school and 
students is uppermost in the minds of its members. The or­
ganization does a surprising number of those thankless but nec­
essary jobs which must be done if social events are to be suc­
cessful. Besides publishing the C-Book and checking coats at 
most of the school’s dances, APO conducts elections, handles 
decorations for Student Council, and collects tickets at athletic 
contests. In short, the scope of their activity is both wide and 
varied.
APO plans an even further expansion next semester. 
Here’s hoping continued success for one of the most necessary 
and versatile of campus organizations.

Editor, the TARTAN:
At the risk of being accused of 
sour grapes, we would like to vent 
several of our views toward the 
annual Sweepstakes design award.
First, let us make it clear that 
we have no disagreement with the 
selection of the first place design 
award this year because that bug­
gy’s performance indicates that it 
was designed to win the race. Our 
attitude is based on the premise 
that all buggies should be built to 
win races. It seems to us that bug­
gies which are not designed to win 
races should not consistently win 
design awards. Please notice that 
we did not say that buggies that 
win races should also receive the 
design trophies.
There has been a growing trend 
in the past few years for organiza­
tions to choose between two goals. 
One group builds buggies in an at­
tempt to win the race; the other 
builds them to win “design.” To 
us, this cuts the spirit of racing 
competition in half.
In our opinion, much of the fault 
should be placed at the feet of the 
design judges. In the past three 
years of our experience with the 
Sweepstakes, we believe that none 
of the judges have had enough 
understanding of the basic fac­
tors which influence the design of 
a fast buggy. They are too easily 
impressed with complicated, but 
inaccurate, steering aftd suspen­
sion systems. Too much emphasis 
is placed upon esthetic prettiness 
while aerodynamic qualities are 
slighted. We wonder if they’ve 
even considered the importance 
of weight distribution, tire friction, 
and general roadability.
Perhaps if the buggy that has 
really NEEDED the rear view mir­
rors for the past four years had 
incorporated a cigar lighter, a slid­
ing cockpit cover, parking lights, 
and a Buick grill, it, too, might 
have placed in the “design” 
awards.
We would like to make two sug­
gestions for next year. First, see 
if judges could be chosen from 
men who really understand the 
factors which influence fast buggy 
design. Every year there is a Pitts­
burgh Soap Box Derby race. The 
construction judges .that handle 
that race might be willing to judge 
Tech’s Sweepstakes design com­
petition. Secondly, we suggest 
that a qualification be made that 
buggies must pL*ce in the top half 
in the race to be eligible for the 
design awards.
Perhaps we have missed the 
point of the design awards. If so, 
we would like to hear from those 
who feel differently about the sub­
ject.
Sincerely,
Thomas M. Birch 
Sellers B. McNally
The following is a copy of the 
letter sent to the editor of the Pitt 
News in reply to an article ap­
pearing in a recent issue of that 
publication. A copy of that article 
can be seen on the bulletin board 
in Administration Hall.
$ H* i
Editor, the Pitt News:
Your May 16 issue contained an 
article titled “Pitt Beats Tech—At 
Last” which drew some interesting 
—and largely erroneous—compar­
isons between Pitt and Carnegie 
Tech.
I for one find it hard to be­
lieve that “almost everyone agreed 
that Pitt’s float parade was far 
superior to the similar extrava­
ganza concocted by our neighbors 
across the valley . . .” Having had 
an opportunity to observe both 
parades, I am quite certain that 
the author of the article in ques­
tion would have to “eat chow” if 
a more direct comparison were 
available—even though Tech was 
hampered by a steady rain during 
the float construction period.
The article also charges that 
Carnegie Tech was unable to put 
on “worthwhile student entertain­
ment.” I assume that the author 
has never heard of “Scotch ’n 
Soda”—a nationally famous stu­
dent organization which writes, 
directs, and produces a complete 
musical comedy each year at 
Spring Carnival. Every member of 
the cast is a student.
Other implications contained in 
the article are hardly worth refut­
ing. Any Pitt student retreating to 
the “backwash of intellectual ac­
tivity over on Forbes Street” will 
soon find the Tech student are 
anything but “narrow specialists” 
who have never heard of the Unit­
ed Nations or racial prejudice. I 
doubt if he will find many Tech 
men who have “clean-cut eagle 
scout friends, who never smokes 
. . . who squires around a chaste
Think It Over
By Dick Ahlstrom
This semester will soon be over, 
and all the happy students at 
Carnegie Tech will be heading 
home to a restful summer of work 
and play. Since this is the last 
issue of the TARTAN I should 
like to present a thought that is 
worth reflecting.
Last year, over in Paris, I met 
a man’s man. A blond, athletic 
viking who wants to cross the 
Atlantic in a kayak. It was he 
who brought my attention to this 
little philosophical tidbit.
« “Be a Thief”
This fellow is no college man. 
He went to sea at the age of 14, 
escaped death by inches, wowed 
the women, and obtained his first 
mate’s papers, all by the time that 
he reached the tender, or other­
wise ,age of 25. He has been around 
and has developed a simple phi­
losophy which can be summed up 
in three words, “Be a thief.”
I recommend it. It is a phifoso- 
phy that cannot be beaten. Too 
many students want everything 
handed to them. They’ve no initi­
ative to learn things by them­
selves. That’s what Rolf meant. 
Material things have no value in 
the overall picture. They are not 
worth stealing. The important 
thing is what is in the mind.
“Steal the Answer”
In Rolf’s words, “Keep your 
eyes open, remember what you 
see, steal it, and use it.”
Too often I’ve heard students 
say after an exam, “That ques­
tion wasn’t fair.” To a thief such 
questions are not only fair, they 
are challenges. Here’s something 
worth while yet to be stolen, some­
thing he doesn’t know. Who can 
he watch; what book can he read; 
who might know, that he may 
steal the answer from him?
Field Day For Thieves 
Similarly, how often do students 
go to class and just listen to the 
instructor' and never bother to 
steal what the instructor doesn’t 
bother to give away. How many 
students study the prof., the boss, 
the minister, to steal that which 
makes them successful and ap­
ply it to themselves so that they 
too will be better.
If you’re going to college you 
must wish to be better. What a 
field day a thief has. Nothing is 
outside of his realm. But to be 
successful in his work a thief has 
to have something a lot of students 
seem to lack—active brains.
College is often too easy for real 
brains, and so they rot like an 
onion left in a damp bin, without 
ever having flowered.
Brains and Common Sense 
Psychology has a lot of fancy 
terms for things, but a good thief 
augments his brains with that 
which the psychologists with all 
their fancy terms have no better 
term for than the simple, old fash­
ioned term of—“common sense.” 
With brains and common sense 
any man who tries can become a 
thief. But it isn’t enough to be a 
thief. Any gutter snipe can suc­
ceed in this. The crown jewels are 
only for the diligent, the patient, 
and the intelligent.
When you go out this summer, 
steal. Steal everything worth 
while that you see. Don’t wait for 
it to be handed to you. Steal it.
maiden whose lips ‘have never 
touched liquor.’ ”
In short, the article appears a 
misdirection of both fact and opin­
ion. An article appearing under 
the name of the assistant editor, as 
did this one, should describe the 
situation accurately as well as au­
thoritatively.
Perhaps the Tartan should have 
ignored this flight into fancy, but 
here was a case where the mis­
statements were big enough to be 
believed. Incidently, I don’t be­
lieve you’ll find many Tech stu­
dents cavorting over the sward in 
their “white saddles and plaid 
hats.” Come up and see.

Results of the election of next year’s technical editorial board 
show John Nodvik, junior math major, as the new editor. Nodvik, 
from Cannonsburg, Pennsylvania, has been a member of the Tech­
nical staff for two years. He is also a member of Tau Beta Pi and
?Pi Mu Epsilon honoraries.
Other members of the new edi­
torial board are: Barry Tarmy, 
business manager; Bob Levy, 
managing editor; Hugh Young, 
features editor; David Goldsmith, 
layout editor; Bruce Padolf, ana 
Lee Goldman, advertising man­
agers; Leonard Van Dyne, circu­
lation manager; Ted Trinkhaus, 
art editor; Don Berman and Wil­
liam Stewart, flexible copy edi­
tors, and Dick Waitzer, fixed copy 
editor.
Has Had Successful Year
The Technical, with its last j 
issue of the school year to go on 
sale this week, has had a very 
successful year. Usually ending 
the year with a deficit of several 1 
hundred dollars, the editors this 
year have managed to have the | 
magazine finish on the credit side 
of the ledger.
Editorial policy for the Tech­
nical will be similar to that fol­
lowed in the past—student work 
is highly encouraged, but out­
standing articles by the faculty 
and other sources are accepted. 
Feature Overlooked 
A feature of the magazine whieh 
is often overlooked by students 
is the chance to gain cash prizes 
by answering the questions found 
in the “Techsperts” section, or by 
submitting questions of their own 
to the column. No mathematical 
background more advanced than 
that expected of freshmen and 
sophomore engineers is needed 
for the solutions.
JR easy-going, big-billed friend has learned to say “No’ 
to these hurry-up, one-puff, one-sniff cigarette tests! “Why”, says he,
“they don't even give you time to finish the cigarette before you’re supposed 
to decide which is mildest!” Millions of smokers have come to the same conclusion 
—there’s just one real way to test the flavor and mildness of a cigarette!
It's the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test, 
which simply asks you to try Camels as a steady smoke 
on a pack-after-pack, day-after-day basis. No snap judgments 
needed! After you’ve enjoyed Camels—and only 
Camels—for 30 days in your ‘"T-Zone 
(T for Throat, T for Taste), we believe you’ll know why . .
Draft Test
The deadline for receipt of 
Selective Service College 
Qualification Test applications 
has been extended to May 25. 
All applications must be in the 
hands of Educational Testing 
Service by May 25, 1951.
This applies to the July 12 
date for those students whose 
religious beliefs prevent their 
taking the test on a Saturday, 
as well as io the June 16 and 
June 30 testings. Applications 
are no longer being processed 
for the May 26 examination, 
and no further tickets will be 
issued for this test.
Any students wishing to 
take the test on any of the for­
mer three dates should secure, 
complete, and mail their ap­
plications at once.

Kenneth Burchard
Heads Printing Department * * ¦ *
K. R. Burchard 
Will Head CIT 
Printing Dept.
Kenneth R. Burchard, an au­
thority in the graphic arts field, 
has been appointed professor and 
head of Carnegie Tech’s depart­
ment of printing management.
A recognized expert on photo­
mechanical reproduction, Profes­
sor Burchard has had broad ad­
ministrative experience in graphic 
arts, as well as being a teacher and 
author. He is also manager of off­
set and photomechanical sales for 
American Type Founders, Inc.
He learned the printing trade as 
printer’s devil with a country 
weekly, the Gasxonade County Re­
publican, Owensville, Missouri. 
Prior to joining American Type 
Founders, Inc. in 1944, Prof. 
Burchard was assistant manager of 
i subcontracting for Goodyear Air­
craft Corporation. From 1930 to 
1943 he was a member of the 
; teaching staff of the Carnegie tie- 
| partment which he now heads.
Following graduation from Wil- 
i liam Jewell College, Liberty, 
Missouri, in 1928, Prof. Burch- 
! ard served as director of printing 
¦ and instructor in graphic arts in 
i the Muskogee, Oklahoma, srhool 
I system, leaving there in 1940.
As head of Carnegie’s printing 
management department, Prof. 
Burchard succeeds Prof. Homer E. 
Sterling, who has been chairman 
of the printing management fac­
ulty and acting department head 
for the past year.
Departments 
Cooperate And 
Produce Book
A new experiment in inter-de­
partmental cooperation has been 
conducted by the printing manage­
ment and the painting and design 
departments.
For the first time, the printers 
and artists have worked “hand-in- 
glove” on the layout of a book, 
“Death of a Salesman.” Each group 
tried to learn the problems of the 
other—the artists gaining informa­
tion about the limitations and 
scope of the printing processes, 
and the printers in turn learning 
how to work with the artists so 
that the production of the book is 
within reason yet faithfully ad­
heres to the artist’s ideas.
As a result of this experiment, 
it is hoped these particular stu­
dents will be better able to work 
with their associates when they 
graduate into industry. Their 
work, including all phases of the 
production of the book, may be 
inspected in the exhibition hall, 
Fine Arts building, beginning Fri­
day, May 25.
It is hoped that this exp 
in cooperation with the ar 
carry over into other field 
dustry, represented by the indus­
trial administration and engineer- 
1 ing departments of Carnegie.

Track Team Unbeaten In Dual Meets
Tartans End Season 
With Win Over Titans
Bateman And Relay Team Break
Own Records Set Last Week
Defeating Westminster 74^-56%, the Carnegie track team end­
ed an undefeated season of dual competition Tuesday for the first 
time since Carnegie has fielded a team of cindermen. The win came 
as a fitting climax to a season which had started slowly with a 
close 64-63 win over the Rough- 
Riders of Case.
The win was not without its mo­
ments of anguish, however, as the 
Tartans sweated out their final 
victory. At the end of the first ten 
events the score stood tied at 45 
all and the outlook wasn’t too 
bright for the Tartans. However, 
the Skibos picked up speed in the 
final five events to finally con­
quer the Titans by 18 points.
Taylor Scores 
Chief point getter for the Tar­
tans was Maurice “Moose” Tay­
lor, the Skibos’ only double win­
ner of the day. Heaving the six­
teen pound shot 38’ 7*4” and fol­
lowing with a 120’ 1” toss of the 
discus, Moose picked up the only 
Plaid points in the two events yet 
still outscored the Westminster 
entrants.
Westminster had two double 
winners in McGrath and Bloom. 
Richard Bloom, a brother of Bill 
Bloom on the Carnegie team, 
turned in wins in both the rfiile 
and two mile runs. His times of 
4:39.5 for the mile and 10:15.2 for 
the two mile run were the fastest 
seen on the Carnegie oval in some 
time. Bloom was followed in both 
the mile and two mile by Bob 
Carmen for the Skibos.
Other Twin Win 
McGrath provided the other 
twin win for the Titans as he swept 
the 100 and 220 yard dashes in the 
times of 10.0 and 22.7 seconds re­
spectively. Johnny Luchok man­
aged to save a second for Carnegie 
in the 100 while Fritz Wilson add­
ed a third in the 220. The Titans’ 
Art Jones was off form as he took 
only a third in the 100 and a sec­
ond in the 220 yard dash.
In the 440 yard dash Fred Price 
turned in one of his best times of 
the year as he outsped his compe­
tition in 52.5. Jim Valias also plac­
ed second for the Skibos.
Miss Hurdles 
Connie Hamman was unable to 
repeat his usual double win in the 
hurdles as he strangely faltered 
near the finish in the 120 yard 
lows and teammate Jim Milligan 
passed him by for the win spot. 
Hammann, took his usual first in 
the high hurdles, however, and 
nabbed second behind Milligan in 
the lows. Milligan finished second 
in the high hurdles.
In the pole vault, Chuck Bate­
man broke the record he had set 
only the week before as he passed 
the crossbars at 12 feet, 6% inches.
Sweep Jump 
The Tartans practically salted 
away their undefeated season 
when they swept the broad jump 
with Luchok, Wood, and Milligan 
taking away the honors. The Ski­
bos added more points as Bate­
man and McKibben took second 
and third in the javelin and Ham 
man took second while Milligan 
tied for third in the high jump.
Another record was set in the 
last event of the day as the relay 
team of Wilson, Luchok, Price, 
and McKibben set a new mark of 
2:38.5 for the 4/5 mile.

Plaid Third In Tri-State Meet 
As Westminster Cops First
Chuck Bateman Smashes Tri-State Record
In Pole Vault By More Than Eight Inches
A Tartan bid to cap an undefeated season with the post-season 
Tri-State championship was foiled by villains Westminster and Betha­
ny, Saturday, as the Plaid team was able to place no better than 
third in the annual meet. *
Competing at the Slippery Rock 
oval, the Skibos saw surprising 
Westminster, a team they had just 
defeated in dual competition, walk 
off with the nine-team champion­
ship with a total of 41% points. 
Bethany, whom the Tartans did 
not meet in the regular season, 
finished with 36% points while 
the Plaid was right behind with 
33%.
Six New Records
In an amazing meet which pro­
duced six new records in the fif­
teen events, Carnegie did have 
the satisfaction of producing one 
of the record breakers. In the pole 
vault Chuck Bateman cleared the 
crossbar at 12 feet 6V4 inches, 
smashing by almost nine inches 
the old standard and almost 
equaling his own record of 12 
feet, 6% inches set Tuesday in 
the meet with Westminster.
Johnny Luchok continued his 
winning ways with a leap of 20 
feet, 9 inches in the broad jump 
and a quarter mile part on the 
winning relay team. Johnny was 
defeated in his specialty, the 100 
yard dash, by McGrath of West­
minster in the slow time of 10.2, 
but managed to place second.
Connie Hammann, .vho lowered 
the Carnegie high hurdle record 
to 15.3 seconds this year met with 
a better man Saturday as White­
head of Bethany clipped off the 
Sticks in 15.1. Hammann placed 
second in the high hurdles, fourth 
in the low hurdles, and added a 
tie for the fourth in the high 
jump.
Relay Wins
The mile relay team of Bill Mc­
Kibben, Fritz Wilson, Johnny Lu­
chok, and Fred Price was the 
third Tartan winner as they 
walked away from their compe­
tition in the fast time of 3 min­
utes, 31.5 seconds.
The stiff competition was tough 
on many of the Carnegie teams 
who had been turning in consist­
ent first and seconds in their 
events. *
Dave Douglas placed fifth in 
the half mile run, which he has 
usually won. He added a fifth, 
however, in the record breaking 
220 yard dash, which was won in 
the best time of the day, 21.9 sec­
onds.
To prove the remarkable time 
of the 220 which was won by John 
McElravey of W & J, one has 
only to multiply the time for the 
100 yard dash, 10.2 seconds by 
2.2 the proportional distance of 
the 220 yard dash to come out 
with the time of 22.44 seconds. 
Considering the fact the time for 
the 220 was one-half second under 
this. McElravey was really burn­
ing up the track.
Other Pointmakers
Other pointmakers for the Tar­
tans were Taylor, who placed 
fifth in the shot put, Bateman, 
who added to his score, with a 
fourth in the javelin throw, Bob 
CarYnan with a fourth in the mile, 
and Fred Price with a fifth in the 
440 yard dash.
Interesting note of the meet 
was the fact the Westminster 
cause was aided considerably by 
the brother of one of the Skibo 
trackmen. Dick Bloom of West­
minster beat his brother, Bill 
Bloom of Carnegie in the two mile 
run. Dick also added a second in 
the mile for the Westminster 
cause. His time of 10 minutes, 
11.1 seconds in the two mile run 
was one of the best performances 
of the day as he lowered the old 
record by an amazing 14 seconds.

More BOUNCE To The Ounce
Tennis Team Brings 
Season Slate To 7-2
Carnegie Tech’s highly successful 1951 tennis team continued 
its winning ways Saturday afternoon by defeating Grove City 9-0. 
The victory brought the Tartan record for the season to seven wins 
and two defeats. *
Two close, tense matches in the 
number one and number two 
singles were the feature of Satur­
day’s encounter with Grove City. 
Bob Wiederhorn came from be­
hind twice to pull his match out 
of the fire, 3-6, 7-5, 8-6. Twice his 
opponent, Bob Wiley, had the score 
at match point, but Wiederhorn 
rallied brilliantly to come out the 
winner.
$ Montstream Wins
John Montstream won the first 
set in his match against Grove 
City’s Poppleton the hard way, 
7-5. Easing the pressure in the 
second set he dropped it 4-6. How­
ever, fast service and hard play 
eventually proved more than Pop­
pleton could handle as Monstream 
emerged the victor, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2.
Don Duncklee won the number 
three singles match in straight 
sets, 6-4, 6-1, turning the tables on 
Bob Davis, who had defeated him 
earlier in the season. Mahlon Sai- 
ble also was an easy victor, re­
peating his earlier defeat of Ihnat- 
ko, 6-3, 7-5. Bob Duff us and Carl 
Finder, Tech’s number five and 
six men, respectively, also won to 
enable Tech to sweep the singles.
In the first doubles contest of 
the afternoon Duffus and Larry 
Cederstrom teamed up to defeat 
Wiley and Poppleton 6-0, 6-4. 
Duncklee and Saible kept the rec­
ord perfect by taking Davis and 
Tower, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and George 
Berringer and John Alexander 
completed the afternoon’s work 
with a 6-4, 10-8 victory over 
Leetch and Yezerinac.
Pitt Too Tough
Pitt handed the Skibos their sec» 
ond defeat of the year last Wed­
nesday, 7-2. Loehstetter, Campney, 
and Rouf, rated one, two, and 
three in Western Pennsylvania de­
feated Wiederhorn, Montstream, 
and Duncklee in that order.
The Panthers went on to sweep 
the singles play and, with the 
combination of Lehstetter and 
Campney, defeat Wiederhorn and 
Montstream in the first doubles 
match. Duncklee and Saible, how­
ever, won their double? contest 
with Bendel and Lichtman. Duffus 
and Cederstrom also came through 
to prevent a shut-out.
On Monday, Tech defeated 
Thiel, 6-1, Davey, defeating Bob 
Wiederhorn in the first match of 
the afternoon, was the only one 
to mar the Tartan clean sweep.

Six Teams Unbeaten 
In IM Softball Play
Metals Club, Theta Xi, DU’s, ATO’s 
Hold Lead In Respective Leagues
The IM softball season moved into the final stages last week with 
Delta Upsilon, Kappa Sigma “A”, Alpha Tau Omega “A”, Theta Xi 
“A”, Cyclops, and the Metals Club still holding on to unblemished 
records. ?---------------------------------------------------—
The DU’s hold the undisputed 
lead in the Tartan League with a 
5-0 chart. The Beta Sigs fell prey 
to the DU’s by a 4-1 score early 
last week and then the DU’s went 
on to crush the SAE’s 9-4.
In the Plaid League, the TX “A” 
team leads the league with a 4-0 
record. The TX’s also played two 
games last week, beating the New­
man Club 13-3, and squeezing past 
the Faculty nine, 6-5, as a seventh 
inning rally by the teachers fell 
short.
AH “A” Teams
The ATO “A” and the Kappa 
Sig “A” have 4-0 and 3-0 records 
respectively in the Thistle League. 
The ATO’s preserved their string 
by trouncing the Dramats 14-7 and 
the Kappa Sigs maintained the 
pace as they turned in a victory 
over the Dramats 15-1.
The Cyclops and the Metals

show victories over the TX “B" 
squad 8-4, and the Architects 6-3 
for the week’s play. The Metals 
Club played only one game, drop­
ping the Architects 4-1.
Runner-Up 
The Phi Kaps kept the runner- 
up position in the Plaid League by 
beating the Faculty 9-7 and the 
Tau Delts 16-10. Sigma Nu “A” 
continued to press the DU’s for 
leadership in the Tartan League 
with a 4-1 chart. They turned in 
an 11-0 victory over Raiders and 
went on to edge ASCE in last 
week’s play.

Officers Elected
New members were installed 
and new officers were elected. 
Justin Davidson was elected presi­
dent and Dick Mitchell, vice pres­
ident. On assuming the chair, 
Davidson congratulated the past 
officers on the fine jobs they had 
done and expressed the hope that 
the new council could continue to 
improve on their record. He also 
mentioned tha+ the absentee policy 
would continue to be enforced.
The committee reports included 
advice for action to be taken dur­
ing the next semester such as 
possible revision of the by-laws 
with regard to publications, the 
establishment of a permanent pub-
action on the suggestions which 
it had received. Through some of 
these suggestions chocolate milk 
was put on sale in Skibo and a 
new common faucet wash bowl 
will be placed in the men’s lava­
tory in Skibo. The problem of the 
cut has been taken to the admin­
istration. A request to have the 
fence near Skibo removed cannot 
be fulfilled since the school is try­
ing to improve the lawn.
Baseball Impractical 
Bob Stroble reported his find­
ings on why Carnegie does not 
have a baseball team. The situ­
ation seems to boil down to the 
fact thàt- a baseball team would 
be highly impractical, both finan­
cially and due to the lack of a 
playing field.

Editor .................................................................................... Frank Mihelich
News Editor ........................................................................... Martha Latza
In Fare well
As is the custom for the last edition of the Plaid, the 
editor always writes a brief resume of what has or has not 
been accomplished during his editorship, but to be different 
we would like to pass on to the future editor a bit of ad­
vice, and a few suggestions pertaining to the Plaid.
Evening students should be made to realize their re­
sponsibility towards their paper. It is through the Plaid 
that they can best voice their opinions and thoughts, but 
they fail to do this. The Plaid is only as effective as its dis­
tribution is wide. Insist that the paper be placed at the most 
advantageous locations each school evening.
Cooperation with the Tartan staff is imperative.
The Plaid staff can be large or small, it matters not, it 
is the contribution of news items that fill the paper. This 
news can best be obtained from the Evening School Regis­
trar’s office and at Evening Student Council Meetings.
In conclusion we would like to thank those students who 
have helped us, and to express a hope that by our efforts, 
some measure of enjoyment was obtained from the Plaid 
during the past school year.
New Evening SC Prexy Leader 
In Extracurricular Activities
Past President Of Sigma Delta Phi, B. May 
Was Treasurer Of Council For 1949-1950
So that evening students will get a preview of the new Presi­
dent of Evening Student Council, we will present Byron May, in this 
semester’s last edition of the Plaid.
Byron is a conscientious, hard working evening student who 
to find time for extra-*-----------------------------—manages
curricular activities even though 
he carries a tough school sched­
ule, a responsible job, and has a 
family.
Byron has been enrolled in the 
mechanical engineering depart­
ment for the past five years, and 
plans some day to obtain a de­
gree in mechanical engineering.
Byron is assistant chief engineer 
at American Chain and Cable 
Company in Monessen, Pa., and 
one of his duties at present is the 
engineering and supervision of 
the coal handling plant being 
erected by his company.
Byron Is past president of Sig­
ma Delta Phi, and member of 
Council for the past three years. 
He has been Handbook editor for 
two years, Council Treasurer for 
the school year 1949-1950, and 
he was co-chairman of the en­
gineering banquet this year.
Byron is happily married and
finds much enjoyment with his 
two children, when he is not 
delving into his school books or 
arranging some function for 
Evening Student Council. Even 
with his busy schedule Byron still 
finds some time to play the game 
he most enjoys, golf.
He is secretly nursing the am­
bition to some day install a com­
plete wood working shop in his 
basement. If his efforts at even­
ing school are any indication, we 
venture to say that it won’t be 
too long before the saws will be 
buzzing in the May’s basement.
The evening students are again 
fortunate in obtaining a fine per­
son who will manage their coun­
cil with dignity. With a little co­
operation, Byron May will give 
the students a good student gov­
ernment.

43 Degrees 
Conferred By%/

Although it appears that the 
number of persons enrolled in 
Carnegie Tech Evening School 
has diminished in the last few 
years, the number of evening stu­
dents graduating from evening 
school is steadily increasing. 
There are 43 possible candidates 
for degrees from evening school 
this year. Of this number eight 
will obtain Master of Science de­
grees, two will obtain Master of 
Fine Arts degrees, and 33 will 
obtain Bachelor of Science de­
grees. The resultant number of 
years involved in obtaining these 
degrees represent much hard work 
and perseverance. The candidates 
should be heartily congratulated 
on their achievement. Listed be­
low are the candidates and their 
respective degrees.
