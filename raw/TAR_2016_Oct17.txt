Following up on the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Or-
chestra’s (PSO) strike, as 
detailed last week in The 
Tartan, PSO musicians were 
picketing in front of Heinz 
Hall on Saturday, Oct. 15. 
Right now, although both 
sides say they are willing 
to sit down and negotiate, 
the situation is much more 
nuanced.
According to an interview 
The Tartan conducted with 
PSO members Zachary Smith 
and Carnegie Mellon pro-
fessor Stephen Kostyniak,  
“management has said they 
are willing to talk with us as 
long as we take the cut, which 
is not negotiating ... the man-
agement should come back 
to the table and negotiate 
with us instead of offering 
ultimatums.” 
Smith and Kostyniak 
emphasized that PSO’s 
fundamental reason for 
striking  is to retain the 
world-class  artistic 
excellence, as, “it’s very clear 
that if the management’s 
proposal were adopted, mu-
sicians will start to leave.” 
Kostyniak said that they have 
already lost musicians. Since 
the last round of pay cuts they 
took in 2011, they have lost 
?ve musicians; during the last 
couple months, they have lost 
another three musicians. 
PSO member Howard 
Micah  said it took them eight 
years and seven auditions to 
replace their principal ?ute 
player whom they lost be-
fore 2011 to the New York 
Philharmonic.
Kostyniak says the man-
agement’s numbers on their 
?scal reports don’t add up. As 
for the new business model 
they are applying, the musi-
cians “can’t ?nd an example 
where their business model 
succeeds,” and “anybody who 
succeeded in the arts industry 
knows that you can’t cut your 
wage to success,” Kostyniak 
said. According to the PSO, 
the board of the orchestra has 
repeatedly said that cutting 
costs further is not an option, 
that the symphony has a rev-
enue problem but not an ex-
pense problem. “Yet instead 
of dealing with the revenue, 
what they are going after is 
the expense, at the expense of 
the quality of the orchestra,” 
Kostyniak said. 
The PSO runs as ef?ciently 
as any other orchestra in the 
country. The symphony in 
Cleveland has an annual bud-
get of $50 million, while the 
PSO has only $33 million. 
Since Pittsburgh has a larg-
er pupulation and stronger 
economy than Cleveland and 
Cincinnati, Kostyniak believes 
“it’s not a matter of it can’t be 
done or the money is not put 
there ... What are Cleveland 
and Cincinnati able to do that

The National Frontiers 
Conference convened in 
Pittsburgh on Thursday. Co-
hosted by Carnegie Mellon 
University and the University 
of Pittsburgh, the event was 
an effort to “explore the fu-
ture of innovation.” The guest 
of honor, President Barack 
Obama, gave a speech and 
participated in a panel dis-
cussion in Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Wiegand Gym-
nasium. The visit marked 
the President’s ?fth visit to 
Carnegie Mellon.
Earlier in the day, 
Carnegie Mellon also hosted 
three smaller conferences, or 
“tracks,” on interplanetary, 
local, and national frontiers 
of innovation. The plenary 
session, during which Presi-
dent Obama spoke, was the 
concluding event of the day.
Carnegie Mellon president 
Subra Suresh opened up the 
session by introducing the 
subject of technological inno-
vation and the unique ability 
of Carnegie Mellon to work 
at the “intersection of tech-
nology and human behavior” 
in order to “enhance lives.” 
He also re?ected on his per-
sonal connection with Presi-
dent Obama, referring to his 
previous post as the director 
of the National Science 
Foundation, and saying that it 
was an honor to welcome the 
president back to Carnegie 
Mellon.
Following Suresh was Tim 
O’Reilly, founder of O’Reilly 
Media, whose message was 
to consider the long-term 
bene?ts of progress, rather 
than short-term detriments. 
He talked about the budding 
era of technological advance-
ments, reminding the audi-
ence that machine-destroying 
Luddites of the seventeenth 
century could never have 
imagined the bene?ts tech-
nology would ultimately 
bring society.
Next up was Raj Chetty, 
an economics professor from 
Stanford, speaking with radio 
show host Roman Mars. The 
professor described how 
statistics and technology was 
being implemented to ana-
lyze conditions of individu-
als and communities around 
the country. He provided 
insights into ways we can 
better deal issues like eco-
nomic segregation and edu-
cational environments on the 
national level.
The youngest speaker of 
the event, Charles Orgbon 
III, encouraged adults to have 
the enthusiasm they felt as 
children. The engaging mil-
lennial spoke of the organiza-
tion he founded in ?fth grade, 
Greening Forward, through 
which he promotes improving 
environmental policy.
Subsequently, a panel 
featuring experts on space 
exploration was introduced. 
Anousheh Ansari, an Internet 
of Things company CEO, for-
mer astronaut NASA Deputy 
Administrator Dava Newman, 
and Blue Origin Manager Er-
ika Wagner were the guests. 
Each offered a unique per-
spective on how they became 
interested in space, the ?nal 
frontier. They offered their 
visions and prospects of what 
could soon become reality, 
and discussed what inspired 
them to turn towards space.
The president of the 
University of Pittsburgh, 
Patrick Gallagher, spoke 
about the contributions of 
the University to frontiers of 
innovation. He talked about 
pushing boundaries of the 
status quo, and the impor-
tance of leaders in spurring 
innovation.
Finally, University of 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mel-
lon medical student, Alexis 
Chidi took the stage to intro-
duce the president. Chidi re-
counted her encounter with 
then-senator Barack Obama 
when she was sixteen and 
ran into him in the elevator. 
She mused about how their 
paths had crossed once again

When it comes to gaming, 
Carnegie Mellon students are 
usually the ones beating the 
computer. But this time, the 
computer beat the students.
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity computer science stu-
dents, Devendra Chaplot and 
Guillaume Lample, recently 
made an artificial intelli-
gence (AI) agent in the video 
game Doom that outplays 
computer-generated agents 
and human gamers. They 
accomplished this by apply-
ing deep-learning techniques 
that taught their agent, 
Arnold, to manipulate the 
game’s 3-D design.
“The work is purely a 
result of our passion for 
artificial intelligence and 
video games,” Chaplot said. 
“Games have been a test-
bed for advancement of AI 
since decades, like Chess, 
Poker, 2-D Atari Games, Go, 
3D FPS Games, and this de-
velopment can be viewed as 
a very small step towards 
creating a general Artificial 
Intelligence.”
Chaplot and Lample’s 
research is a major feat 
since players are forced to 
make their moves while only 
seeing a part of the game 
on the screen. This research 
happened after Google’s 
DeepMind came out. Google 
also used deep-learning 
techniques to beat renowned 
gamer Go at the 2-D Atari 
2600 video games. A key 
difference between these 
two projects is that Atari al-
lows players to see the whole 
playing field, while Doom is 
much more limited.
“The fact that their bot 
could actually compete with 
average human beings is im-
pressive,” associate professor 
of machine learning Rus-
lan Salakhutdinov said in a 
university press release.
Chaplot and Lample’s 
work is also receiving a lot 
of recognition since put-
ting their research on the 
internet, submitting it to 
an AI conference, and post-
ing videos of their agent’s 
game on YouTube. In three 
days, their videos got over 
100,000 views. Also, Chap-
lot and Lample’s agent was 
awarded second place in the 
Visual Doom AI competition 
where AI agents participate 
in deathmatches against 
each other.
The pair’s feat is important 
to computer science be-
cause of the many difficul-
ties the researchers had to 
overcome for the computer 
agent to beat humans and 
the game-generated agents. 
Since humans are better at 
tracking and avoiding ene-
mies in the game’s 3D world, 
Chaplot believes that gives 
them an advantage over a 
computer. Also, the game’s 
agents have maps and other 
information that help them 
cheat the system.
To make up for these 
discrepancies, Chaplot and 
Lample had their agent fig-
ure out his moves by only 
seeing what’s on the screen, 
like human gamers. This 
was achieved by using cer-
tain deep learning processes 
based on neural networks. 
As the player goes through 
the game, the system uses 
Deep Q-Network, but when it 
notices an enemy, the agent 
uses a Deep Recurrent Q-
Network that has long short-
term memory that watches 
what the enemy does and 
helps figure out where the 
agent should shoot.
Although Chaplot and 
Lample have already put an 
immense amount of work 
into their current model, 
they still have a lot they want 
to do with AI technology.
“We would like to extend 
this work to improve our 
AI agent to tackle more 
complex games,” Chaplot 
said. “In the future, the 
deep reinforcement learning 
techniques we used to teach 
Arnold to play a virtual game 
might help self-driving cars 
operate safely on real-world 
streets and train robots to 
do a wide variety of tasks to 
help people.”

CMU professors look to Clinton’s memoirs in order to decipher perception problems 
Rebecca Doerge has 
officially been installed as 
the seventh dean of the Mel-
lon College of Science. On 
Oct. 6, hundreds of people 
gathered in the Mellon In-
stitute Auditorium to wit-
ness this momentous oc-
casion. This was the first 
ceremony held to commem-
orate the new position of a 
Carnegie Mellon University 
dean. Ceremonies will be 
held to commemorate the 
installation of future deans.
President Subra Suresh, 
Provost Farnam Jahanian, 
and Neil Donahue, Lord 
Professor of Chemistry and 
Co-Chair of the MCS Dean 
Search Committee, all spoke 
at the event about the im-
portance of science and why 
Doerge is the right person to 
lead the Mellon College of 
Science.
“We have a lot to look 
forward to, we have a lot to 
work hard for and we have 
a new leader in the Mellon 
College of Science to take 
us in that direction … to el-
evate MCS to a new level,” 
Suresh said, as noted in a

Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet Writer 
of The Student Government. 
An amazing resource that 
has sprouted out of the ef-
forts of the higher levels of 
administration on campus is 
the Provost’s Task Force. The 
Task Force itself is comprised 
of about 25 members, all of 
whom are faculty, staff, stu-
dents, or alumni, who meet 
every month to re?ect on 
the student experience at 
Carnegie Mellon and develop 
recommendations to enhance 
and better student life on 
campus. They come together 
to ponder immensely tough 
questions such as: What do 
students need? How do we 
engage with students on 
the work they are doing, or 
wish to do? With these types 
of questions lie great ambi-
tions, which is why outside 
of the central Task Force lie 
the working groups, which 
contain the same diversity of 
members, but meet separately 
and specialize in one of ?ve 
special interests that the 
Provost has identi?ed.
In its relatively short 
existence, the Task Force has 
already been able to accom-
plish some amazing and vital 
things. It initiated the year 
with new language in all syl-
labi on mental health that will 
serve as a reminder through-
out the semester that we all 
deserve to care for ourselves. 
Through offering free Group X 
?tness classes to all students, 
the Task Force gave us means 
to relax and be mindful about 
our health. It distributed CMU 
Cares brochures, which detail 
guidelines and possible re-
sources to all faculty and staff 
on campus if a student were to 
reach out to them expressing 
a need for support, and along 
a similar vein, introduced ?ve 
new staff members to CaPS to 
further ensure that someone 
is always available if students 
need the support.
Again, we are shown that 
there are no limits to what 
is possible when passionate 
members of our campus com-
munity come together with 
a goal of producing change. 
What a better way to ful?ll 
a year of compassion than 
working hard to ensure that 
opportunities of kindness 
to yourself are unlimited 
on campus.
The Task Force isn’t 
af?liated with Carnegie Mel-
lon Student Government, but 
our 2016–2017 Student Body 
President, Vaasavi Unnava, 
and Vice President, Aaron 
Gutierrez, are members of its 
Health and Well Being Ser-
vices working group, meaning 
they are an incredible point of 
contact for recommendations 
anyone might have on the 
integration of Carnegie 
Mellon University profes-
sionals and students for the 
goal of better campus mental 
health.
Don’t have the time to 
stop by SBP & SBVP Of?ce 
Hours (held on Fridays from 
11 a.m.–1 p.m. at variable 
locations on campus, usually 
announced via the Facebook 
page)? You can always send in 
your thoughts on how you be-
lieve we can help engage our 
community to the Task Force 
at CMUExperience@cmu.edu.
Carnegie Mellon’s David 
Kaufer, the Paul Mellon 
Distinguished Professor of 
English, and the Univer-
sity of Maryland’s Shawn J. 
Parry-Giles analyzed Hill-
ary Clinton’s two political 
memoirs, Living History 
and Hard Choices. Through 
their research, they sought 
to uncover links to the U.S. 
democratic presidential can-
didate’s public perception 
problems.
Kaufer and Parry-Giles 
used DocuScope, a digital 
humanities tool developed 
by Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, to statistically tag, 
examine, and visualize the 
text of her memoirs for rhe-
torical patterns. They found 
that Living History delved 
into Clinton’s most intimate 
thoughts, while Hard Choices 
focused on her public service 
performance.
The study showed that 
in both memoirs, Clinton 
remained very guarded. 
“Our important ?nding was 
the interleaving of the styles 
across both memoirs and 
Clinton’s choice to employ 
an institutional style when a 
personal style was not only 
expected, but hyped by her 
publishers,” Kaufer said in a 
university press release.
Kaufer and Parry-Giles 
believe that gender played 
a role in this decision. They 
cite the “double-bind” that 
women face in politics. 
“Women in politics, like 
Clinton, often ?nd they can’t 
be too intellectual or too 
emotional — or too serious 
or too jovial,” Parry-Giles 
said. They believe that Clin-
ton’s guardedness is a direct 
result of this.
The study was published 
in the National Communica-
tion Association’s Quarterly 
Journal of Speech.

On Thursday, before 
President Obama had ar-
rived, the Frontiers confer-
ence began with several 
sessions explaining how ar-
tificial intelligence (AI) and 
data science affect various 
levels of policy. The local 
and national sessions, called 
tracks, took place on the sec-
ond floor of the Cohon Cen-
ter. The panels were a who’s 
who of academic and corpo-
rate giants in the field of AI 
such as Engineering Director 
at Uber’s Advanced Technol-
ogies Center Raffi Krikorian 
and Corporate Vice President 
of Microsoft Research Jea-
nette Wing. The local policy 
track also featured munici-
pal government officials who 
embody the spirit of mak-
ing data “work for us” as the 
president often says.
The National Frontiers 
track opened with Pennsyl-
vania Governor Tom Wolf 
telling the story of innova-
tion in Pennsylvania, begin-
ning with William Penn’s 
idea of freedom of con-
science, winding through the 
founding ideas of American 
government born in Penn-
sylvania, touching on the 
agricultural and industrial 
revolutions, and finally land-
ing on the transportation 
revolution which still roils on 
today as self driving cars be-
come frequent sights on the 
streets of Pittsburgh. “Wel-
come to Pittsburgh; welcome 
to Pennsylvania; welcome to 
the future,” said Wolf before 
he ceded the stage to a series 
of “lightning speakers” who 
gave ten minute talks on their 
areas of interest or expertise.
The first speaker was 
Tanya Berger-Wolf of the 
University of Illinois at Chi-
cago. She spoke about how 
data science is making it pos-
sible to track animals with-
out invasive tracking devices 
that could be dangerous to 
the animals. The program 
she referred to was able to 
use machine learning tech-
niques to identify species and 
even individual animals. This 
resulted in programs like 
Flukebook for tracking whale 
flukes and the IoT, Internet 
of Turtles.
The second speaker was 
Carnegie Mellon robotics 
professor Stephen Smith. 
Smith presented a plan to 
alleviate urban congestion by 
having traffic lights autono-
mously optimize their own 
patterns and then send that 
information downstream so 
future lights know what to 
expect. This program found 
great success in Penn Circle, 
reducing travel time by 26 
percent, idling time by 41 
percent, and emissions by 21 
percent. After a successful 
expansion to Bakery Square, 
Smith’s team plans to con-
tinue expanding the program 
throughout Pittsburgh.
The final lightning 
speaker, Suchi Suria of Johns 
Hopkins, explained how elec-
tronic health records could 
be used to diagnose condi-
tions such as sepsis that re-
quire a quick response. The 
algorithm she and her team 
developed was able to use 
these records to discover 
sepsis up to 24 hours before 
doctors are able to make 
the same diagnosis. This ap-
proach was not unique to 
sepsis, and has also been suc-
cessful in responding to oth-
er conditions and could help 
diagnostics significantly.
Krikorian and Wing, 
alongside founding director 
of the New York University 
Center for Data Science and 
Director of AI Research at 
Facebook Yann LeCun, Vice 
President of Cognitive Com-
puting at IBM Guru Bana-
var, and research scientist 
at Google Francoise Beau-
fays, participated in a panel 
on best practices in AI. The 
panel began with how AI 
developed from something 
of a niche field of study into 
the dominating presence it 
has today. All of the mem-
bers of the panel agreed 
that the convergence of the 
available tools — humans 
now having powerful com-
puters in our pockets — and 
deep learning in the last five 
years have expanded the ca-
pabilities of AI to the point 
where they are unavoidable. 
Deep learning is a process 
by which an algorithm at-
tempts to model abstractions 
from data, allowing for more 
general decisions. Wing 
explained that AI began as a 
dream of recreating human 
intelligence, but that quickly 
proved challenging. Eventu-
ally, people identified indi-
vidual tasks that a human 
can do and attempted to 
algorithmically recreate 
them which has lead to the 
specialized AI we have today.
The panel also got into 
some of the specific limita-
tions that computers face. 
One specific example that 
LeCun gave was the differ-
ence between the sentences 
“the trophy did not fit in the 
suitcase because it was too 
large” and “the trophy did 
not fit in the suitcase because 
it was too small.” Humans 
observe the world and are 
easily able to discern that 
either the suitcase was too 
small to contain the trophy or 
the trophy was too large to fit 
in the suitcase, but that ob-
servation of reality is missing 
from computers. Wing added 
that conversational English 
is different from written Eng-
lish and sometimes people 
will switch languages when 
they are speaking. LeCun be-
lieves that these challenges 
have to be overcome before 
AI can start to function as 
accurately as humans.
Finally, Wing mentioned 
the importance of secure AI 
that is safe from some of the 
more harmful tendencies of 
people. This was in response 
to a question about Micro-
soft’s Tay, which has been 
described as a “Hitler-loving 
sex robot.” Tay was origi-
nally supposed to be an au-
tomated conversational bot 
that picked up on people’s 
tendencies, but was quickly 
corrupted into saying some 
things that were less than 
friendly. This came on the 
heels of a wildly successful 
version of Tay named XiaoIce 
which was released in China. 
It showed the need to actively 
make sure AI doesn’t become 
harmful.
In the Local Frontiers 
track, Chief Data Scientist 
at the University of Chicago 
Center for Data Science and 
Public Policy Rayid Ghani, 
Knoxville Chief of Police 
David Rausch, and Commis-
sioner of the Massachusetts 
Department of Public Health 
Monica Bharel discussed how 
data can be used to disrupt 
cycles of incarceration. 
Rausch’s police department 
has gone two years without a 
police involved shooting, and 
when asked about how that 
happened, he responded that 
there was a little luck but a 
lot of effort. He mentioned 
that community engagement 
helped officers and their 
communities interact more 
positively. He also talked 
about how the education of 
officers, including a large 
increase in the number of of-
ficers with four year degrees, 
and more stable working 
conditions and hours for po-
lice officers helped to make 
police less likely to need vio-
lence. He also talked about 
how officers are trained to 
reset situations where they 
are at a disadvantage so 
they never have to resort to 
violence. Ghani added that 
these were all backed up 
by data saying these were 
meaningful predictors of 
violence. Police who have 
four year degrees are less 
likely to commit an act of 
police violence while police 
who consistently respond 
to distressing situations 
such as domestic violence 
or suicides are more likely 
to commit an act of violence 
in the coming weeks.
Bharel also added the 
importance of tackling 
substance abuse to disrupt-
ing cycles of incarceration 
and talked about how Mas-
sachusetts implemented 
the State Without Stigma 
program to help create vo-
cabulary to talk about drug 
use and addiction in a way 
that doesn’t alienate people. 
She also spoke about how 
the data supports that the 
start of the opioid crisis is 
not heroin and illegal drugs, 
but that this comes as a re-
sult of opioid prescriptions 
for things like back pain. 
The data explains the flow 
of the problem and helps the 
department respond.
The tracks were heavy on 
specific policy discussions 
and how data science affects 
how both private and public 
entities should respond to the 
vast amount of information 
that now surrounds us. They 
were followed by the ple-
nary session featuring Presi-
dent Obama that focused on 
brain science and medical 
information.
National Frontiers panelists discuss how AI can affect policy
and welcomed the president 
onstage.
As the president walked 
on stage to the podium, he 
was greeted by a standing 
ovation from the crowd. His 
opening remarks were of 
thanks, to the several impor-
tant decision-makers in at-
tendance, as well as the lead-
ers of both Carnegie Mellon 
University and the University 
of Pittsburgh.
The president then went 
into detail about some of 
the amazing things he had 
seen earlier in the day, such 
as a space shuttle designed 
by the private sector, and 
made a quip about success-
fully sticking a landing on the 
ISS, referring to a computer 
simulation.
Pittsburgh, he said, has 
“revitalized itself through 
technology,” going further 
to mention the advances of 
Uber self-driving technology, 
medical breakthroughs at the 
University of Pittsburgh Med-
ical Center, and examples of 
progress, such as the “Girls 
of Steel” initiative, backed by 
Carnegie Mellon that allows 
young girls in the Pittsburgh 
area to learn about robotics. 
He noted that improvement 
of society through scienti?c 
advancement is consistent 
with the nation’s identity, 
and that “science has always 
been central to our progress.” 
He touched on green energy, 
medicine, smart city develop-
ment, space exploration, and 
economics, as ?elds in which 
further progress needs to be 
made through innovation.
Several times throughout 
his speech, the president 
hinted that his emphasis on 
science and education was 
also a political issue. “We 
don’t just listen to science 
just when it ?ts our ideology” 
he said, speaking about the 
viewpoints of some political 
conservatives. He warned 
that denying scienti?c 
consensus such as climate 
change can have rami?ca-
tions beyond making bad pol-
icy. Such positions, he says, 
undermine what has made 
America the global leader in 
science and technology that 
it is today. Such viewpoints 
lead to the loss in funding 
for research and develop-
ment, which has given us 
some of the most important 
technology in the modern 
world.
The president mentioned 
his efforts to improve Ameri-
ca’s standing in STEM ?elds. 
In particular, saying that it is 
critically important to make 
sure that education in these 
?elds is accessible to all, 
and that American culture 
needs to adapt to place value 
on science and technology. 
His remark about the White 
House Science Fair sending 
the message that the “win-
ner of the Super Bowl isn’t 
the only one that deserves a 
celebration in the east room” 
earned a round of applause 
from the audience.
President Obama pushed 
further on education, saying 
that we cannot have children 
with high potential “languish-
ing in [substandard schools.]” 
Our duty, he said, is to make 
sure that advancements do 
not leave segments of society 
behind, and that progress is 
made in an equitable way. 
He said that part of his job as 
president is to make sure that 
the legacy from his adminis-
tration is continued work in 
the ?eld of science.
His ?nal remarks were 
about his meeting a man 
named Nathan Copeland, 
and on the subject of brain 
research. Nathan Copeland 
had been paralyzed by a car 
accident, but was recently 
given new hope by a research 
team from the University of 
Pittsburgh. Part of a DARPA-
sponsored initiative, the 
researchers implanted mi-
croelectrodes in his brain, 
which allowed him to con-
trol a robotic arm just by 
thinking about it. Nathan 
was able to shake the presi-
dent’s hand and even give 
him a ?st-bump. Additionally, 
“Nathan is the ?rst person in 
human history who can feel 
with his prosthetic ?ngers.” 
The president said that the 
idea is to “push the bounds 
of what is possible,” making 
the point that people like Na-
than are given new opportu-
nities thanks to investments 
in science.
Finishing his speech, 
he joined the panel on 
Brain Science and Medical 
Information.
The panel was moderated 
by Atul Gawande, a surgeon 
and public health researcher 
who has written four award-
winning books on the subject 
of medicine. In addition to the 
President, the panel included 
Kafui Dzirasa, a Neuroscien-
tist working with Duke Uni-
versity, Data Scientist Ricca-
rdo Sabatini, who has worked 
in computational genetics, 
and cellist Zoe Keating.
Dzirasa wowed the 
audience by breaking down 
the dynamics of speech, 
demonstrating his cross-
educational background in 
engineering and neurobiol-
ogy. Next, he talked about his 
personal journey with study-
ing the brain, saying that the 
schizophrenia that runs in 
his family is what ?rst inter-
ested him in the subject. He 
said that the current brain 
research of the kind the Presi-
dent had spoken about earlier 
is a chance for engineers and 
scientists to get engaged in 
treating mental health and 
remove the stigma it so often 
entails.
Sabatini spoke on how 
his ?eld has changed in the 
past few years. A trained 
physicist, Sabatini applied his 
knowledge to the ?eld of data 
science. “The next century is 
going to be about biology,” he 
said, talking about his work 
with digitalizing the human 
genome. He explained how 
there is much that can be ex-
tracted by analyzing genetic 
data. Cancer and susceptibil-
ity to diseases can be ascer-
tained by sifting through the 
genetic information.
Zoe Keating shared her 
personal experiences with 
medical information. Her 
husband was diagnosed with 
stage four lung cancer in 
2014. When it was discov-
ered, she said, the cancer had 
spread all over his body. Ke-
ating discussed the changes 
that need to be made to the 
system. “You wouldn’t believe 
what I had to do. I had to drive 
disks [to the hospital]” she 
said, describing the situation 
where medical information 
was not shared from hospital 
to hospital. She said she was 
encouraged by the advance-
ments that have been made 
in medical data in the past 
few years, and commended 
the president on his efforts 
to alleviate the burden of 
paying for treatment through 
reforms like Obamacare.
The president followed 
this up by saying that his 
ultimate goal in medical re-
search is to make sure that 
the research done by Dzirasa, 
Sabatini and others results 
in people like Zoe’s husband 
getting better treatment. 
One way in which that can 
be done, he said, is having a 
model for research where the 
data is spread more freely. 
A contemporary cancer re-
searcher may have to rely on 
the data from one hospital or 
institution, but it is important 
to open up more information 
that leads to better quality 
research. The government’s 
approach, he said, is to look 
at the healthcare system ho-
listically and push the sys-
tem to bring the results of 
research to its patients.
Over the course of the 
discussion, the panelists 
switched back and forth 
between talking about 
improvements that need to 
be made in medical data 
and healthcare, and poli-
cies that may encourage 
these changes.
With regard to policy, 
Obama spoke about the need 
for expanded and improved 
health insurance oppor-
tunities. He said that how 
that is implemented is fair 
ground for debate. One of 
the speci?cs he mentioned 
were plans that cover small 
expenses, but do not cov-
er important or expensive 
procedures, like dealing with 
cancer, in reference to Zoe’s 
experience.
The president’s ?nal 
comments were aimed at 
drawing a contrast between 
government and industry, 
saying that “government will 
never run the way Silicon 
Valley runs.” He described 
democracy as intrinsically 
“messy,” and pointed out that 
the government has many 
additional responsibilities 
to take into consideration 
when making policy. While 
innovation and societal 
improvement are at the 
forefront of the Government’s 
agenda, people need to 
recognize that rather than 
completely changing the 
systems in place, efforts 
should instead be placed on 
strategic improvements.

EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
Dining is an integral part 
of every student’s Carnegie 
Mellon experience. On cam-
pus, there are a variety of 
dining options, partly thanks 
to the new initiatives put in 
place by Dining Services. 
These include the opening of 
new restaurant locations on 
campus, the launch of a new 
interactive, mobile-friendly 
web interface, and initiatives 
to make dining a safe and 
smooth experience for people 
with allergies and special 
dietary needs.
In an interview with the 
Tartan, Pascal Petter, the Di-
rector of Dining, said that 
the opening of new locations 
such as iNoodle and Au Bon 
Pain matched the goals as 
outlined by Dining Services 
in its strategic plan and co-
incided with the university’s 
initiative to expand the Co-
hon Center. “Both of these 
dining locations allowed us 
to create healthier, engaging, 
and interactive venues,” 
Petter said. “We also saw this 
as an opportunity to look at 
the Skibo Café, because it 
was such a large dining loca-
tion, to renovate the space al-
together and to make it part 
of the Cohon Center expan-
sion.” The University’s reno-
vation initiative at the Cohon 
Center led Dining Services 
to push the timeline of the 
Skibo Café renovation up so 
that the two projects could 
proceed at the same time.
Another major goal of 
these new dining initiatives 
is to promote better health 
and wellbeing, says Mandi 
Semple, the Director of Mar-
keting for Student Affairs 
Operations at Carnegie Mel-
lon. “The expansion in gen-
eral was focusing on wellness 
and ?tness, and performance 
with studio theater,” says 
Semple. One of the newer 
on-campus locations to of-
fer healthy choices is Au Bon 
Pain, which opened in May 
2016. For Semple, and other 
members of Dining Services, 
having a concept that offers 
healthy options such as soups 
or smoothies, was important.
This autumn, iNoodle, 
located in Newell-Simon 
Hall, is a new presence on 
campus. iNoodle occupies 
the location formerly held 
by Mitchell’s, a deli, whose 
head has since semi-retired. 
Dining Services was then 
faced with the decision of 
doing something new with 
the space, which is when, ac-
cording to Petter, “[they] de-
cided to make it an authentic 
Asian concept.” iNoodle has 
different kinds of ramen and 
a create-your-taste ramen 
deli, as well as sides ranging 
from dumplings to sesame 
pancakes to hash browns on 
its menu.
The renovation and 
expansion required a half-
year-long Request for Pro-
posal (RFP) process, during 
which the University put 
out its goals for the proj-
ect and different companies 
submitted proposals to meet 
these goals.
During the renovation 
process, a major challenge 
faced by Dining Services was 
seating. Many students prefer 
to work on homework and get 
their meals in the Cohon Cen-
ter, meaning that the seating 
areas throughout the build-
ing were full most of the time. 
Semple says that they ended 
up adding around 30 seats 
during the renovation period 
to accommodate students’ 
needs and preferences.
Healthy dining is not the 
only goal in the revamping 
of the old Skibo Café, which 
now houses Au Bon Pain. 
“It’s a great gathering place, 
where students can socialize 
and interact with each oth-
er,” Petter said. There are col-
laborative spaces and seating 
areas there that are open 24 
hours a day where students 
can meet to socialize and 
study. Paper is even provided 
for students to take notes on.
Besides physical renova-
tion, there are a host of new 
web-based initiatives to make 
the Dining Services website 
more interactive and more 
mobile-friendly. Semple said 
that about 70 percent of 
people who visit the Dining 
Services website go to the 
page with information on 
the various locations, menus, 
and dining hours. Not only 
has the website been updated 
to be easier to use on mobile 
devices, there are also new 
features such as color codes 
that tell the viewer whether 
a location is open or closed, 
date range searches that al-
low the viewer to see what is 
open well in advance of the 
date, searches by building or 
by services like online cater-
ing, and maps that show GPS 
coordinates. There is also a 
direct link to the nutrition 
calculator which is another 
aspect of the focus on health 
and well-being.
In addition to increasing 
dining variety, Dining Ser-
vices recently hired Jessica 
Tones as a Registered Di-
etitian, Nutrition Educator 
and Marketing Coordinator 
as part of an initiative 
to facilitate the dining 
experience for students with 
allergies and other special 
dietary needs. Students with 
multiple or severe allergies 
go through Health Services 
?rst to ?gure out the best 
accommodations. Students 
who have less severe allergies 
or just a single allergy can 
use the Nutrition Calculator, 
which lists common allergens 
in the menu items. Students 
can also always request an 
allergy sheet from any of the 
dining locations. “Our goal is 
to improve that communica-
tion and tailor our menus and 
our concepts moving forward 
for students [with special 
dietary needs],” said Tones.
Dining Services’ new ini-
tiatives re?ect the extent of 
the needs and diversity of 
Carnegie Mellon students 
and staff regarding varying 
tastes and preferences. They 
also re?ect a response to the 
national conversation about 
healthy eating to promote 
the wellbeing of the campus 
community.
Pittsburgh is not able to do?” 
The musicians say they 
are going to do whatever it 
takes to keep the world-class 
orchestra in Pittsburgh, and 
they think management and 
the board need to commit to 
have a world-class orchestra.
According to an interview 
The Tartan conducted with 
Melia Tourangeau, the Presi-
dent and CEO of the PSO, 
management just wants to 
work together with the musi-
cians to ensure the preserva-
tion of the music. “We hope 
to return to negotiations 
with them as soon as pos-
sible,” said Tourangeau. Ac-
cording to the PSO, although 
the musicians are worrying 
that this cut will move the 
orchestra from being in the 
top ten in the nation, the or-
chestra will still be in the top 
15. Also, while the first year 
of their proposed three-year 
contract calls for a 15 per-
cent salary reduction, in the 
second year, pay would rise 
by two percent and in the 
third year pay would rise by 
three percent.
Tourangeau states, “We 
are facing a financial cri-
sis, a $20.4 million hole 
that must be addressed. We 
need to meet this challenge 
head-on to help ensure that 
the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra is here for gen-
erations to come.” She said 
that “the Board of Trustees 
of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
and our management team 
is committed to the future 
of the symphony and to pre-
serving the livelihoods of 
our musicians ... We want to 
work together to ensure the 
preservation of the music.”
As for the strike, 
Tourangeau said “while the 
musicians may feel that they 
are striking against manage-
ment, they are, in reality, de-
priving the community of the 
full orchestral experience at 
Heinz Hall.” While the past 
strike of the Minnesota was a 
lockout by the management, 
“this is a strike by the 
performers.” According to 
her, the performers receive 
a base salary, but two-thirds 
of the performers receive 
more than this. The top per-
formers are very well com-
pensated. “If they leave the 
orchestra, it is their own 
personal choice but it is not 
for financial reasons that we, 
management, control ... And 
if they leave we offer com-
petitive enough salaries that 
equally talented perform-
ers will be happy to fill their 
spots,” Tourangeau said.
Tourangeau said that 
“most of the performers have 
not had experience with the 
business side and that is why 
we exist to do what we do and 
ensure that the music can 
keep going ... it’s dishearten-
ing when [the performers] 
don’t want to work with us. 
We all want the same things. 
We all care deeply about the 
music. I wouldn’t be in this 
field if I didn’t.”
As for the figures posted 
on the musicians’ websites 
calling into question the fis-
cal decisions and facts from 
the management, Tourange-
au responds by saying that 
“Their figures reflect an in-
complete understanding of 
the challenges we face. In 
some instances, it seems that 
they are only choosing points 
that appear to support their 
view ... Their interpretation 
is inaccurate.”
Tourangeau also said that 
“we want to add new spaces 
on organizational and board 
committees for performers 
from across the orchestra; 
we want them to be a part 
of the discussion about the 
future of the orchestra and 
the specific fiscal and man-
agement strategy. Perform-
ers have been on the steering 
committees of all the orches-
tras I have managed.”
Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity is closely connected 
with the PSO. According to 
the Dean of the School of 
Music Denis Colwell, the 
connection goes all the way 
back to the beginning of the 
school. In fact, Carnegie 
Mellon University’s School of 
Music was started with some 
of the members of the sym-
phony, with the hope that 
students could be trained to 
play in the PSO. Nowadays, 
the School of Music has the 
talented performers of the 
PSO teach studio lessons to 
students and still benefits 
from being close to such a 
world-class orchestra.
As for the possible effects 
that the strike will have on 
the universities that are 
closely connected with the 
orchestra, Kostyniak believes 
that if great musicians leave 
for other symphonies, then 
it is possible that Carnegie 
Mellon University, as well 
as Duquesne University, will 
lose many great teachers, 
which could harm the uni-
versities’ music reputation 
and cause students to 
go elsewhere.
Concerning music 
education, Tourangeau tells 
us that performers need to 
learn how to engage their 
audience, to be exuding the 
energy and passion of the or-
chestra in and out of the per-
formance hall. According to 
her, the ability to work with 
people is crucial for being 
an orchestral performer. She 
also mentions that “this is 
something the PSO perform-
ers are very good at and the 
best of any orchestra I have 
worked with.”
As for the music education 
at Carnegie Mellon, Col-
well noted that “we teach 
our students; we certainly 
use the symphony orches-
tra as a training vehicle, 
such as our Carnegie Mel-
lon Philharmonic, but the 
net result for most students 
is not going to be playing at 
PSO. What we are trying to 
do is to make them music 
artists of the highest order 
and one of the components 
of that training is the sym-
phony orchestra repertoire. 
The bases of the education 
here are that we are trying 
to train them for the real 
world, as music artists to find 
your way, invent your path 
going forward and I think 
Carnegie Mellon is very 
good at this.”
When asked about the 
future of orchestras, as well 
as the classical music indus-
try, Tourangeau said that 
orchestras are going to con-
tinue being relevant. She 
also mentions that technol-
ogy is going to help engage 
new groups and orchestras 
are going to continue be-
ing relevant and powerful 
venues for performers and 
there will be many jobs still 
available in this industry.
Colwell also mentions his 
belief that “Beethoven still 
talks to people, still talks 
meaningfully, still has pow-
er.” However, when it comes 
to economic problems, how 
can you reach a larger audi-
ence and monetize that? “In 
my world, the obvious thing 
is Virtual Reality,” Colwell 
said. Colwell looks into the 
future where someone can 
try the product of an orches-
tra from the comfort of their 
own home, which might even 
be a better experience of art. 
According to him, people 
have already been doing 
that. “To take the product 
you are already doing and 
cast your net wider than that 
... In my view that’s the fu-
ture.”
According to Colwell, 
symphony orchestras are 
not going away. Although 
the market of classical mu-
sic is relatively small, “there 
is a big enough market 
world-wide,” and he notes 
that “we are confident that 
the art is going to continue 
well-past our lifetime. That I 
think without a doubt.”
Dining Services expands dining options with new restaurants

STRIKE, from A1

---------------------------------------------------

On Oct. 6, Provost Farnam Jaha-
nian sent out an email to the entire 
Carnegie Mellon community, report-
ing on the progress and goals of the 
Task Force on the CMU Experience. In 
the email, he described the Task Force 
as a group of more than 80 students, 
faculty, alumni, and staff working to 
take steps that would cumulatively 
make for a happier, healthier, and 
stronger Carnegie Mellon community.
Some of the many goals of the Task 
Force include “intentional structures 
for mentoring and nurturing; spaces 
and opportunities for re?ection, play 
and meaningful interaction; and ex-
panded access to academic advising 
and professional support, among 
other initiatives.”
Jahanian also wrote about the 
forthcoming announcement of an 
“unprecedented opportunity for all 
of us to engage in a campus-wide 
dialogue” and encouraged everyone 
at Carnegie Mellon to visit the Task 
Force’s progress and goals web page, 
and write back to the Task Force with 
suggestions and ideas. These are wel-
come steps that should go a long way 
in further improving the quality of the 
Carnegie Mellon experience in softer, 
more subjective ways. That said, 
there is room for improvement.
The Task Force was originally an-
nounced by President Subra Suresh 
on Apr. 20, as a part of the Presi-
dent’s Advisory Board initiative, a 
permanent and external group of em-
inent individuals meant to bring new 
expertise and unbiased recommenda-
tions on a variety of issues. 
Some of the other steps announced 
as part of the Advisory Board initia-
tive included a pilot program via the 
Eberly Center that would enhance the 
classroom experience, a massive new 
wellness center set to open in  2018-
2019, an increase in the availability of 
hours and counselors at Counseling 
and Psychological Services (CaPS), 
and several improvements in univer-
sity-provided child care, particularly 
for younger faculty and graduate 
students.
Speci?cally, the Task Force on the 
student experience is described as a 
group that will “will begin develop-
ing near-term and long-term recom-
mendations” after “an examination 
of campus climate.” This objective, 
while necessary and welcome, is 
vague and open to interpretation. 
However, even in May there was an 
emphasis on making the Task Force 
inclusive, with members composed 
of faculty, staff, students and alumni.
A previous Tartan Editorial Board, 
written in our April 25 edition, fol-
lowing President Suresh’s April 20 
email, echoed similar sentiments 
of cautious, skeptical optimism. In 
that article, we argued that while 
the proposed action items sounded 
great in theory, far too little concrete 
information was provided to inspire 
con?dence. 
We pointed out that “the plans 
[the administration] promises are not 
yet developed enough. Even though 
conversations have begun, the an-
nouncement came before the mem-
bers of the advisory board or the Task 
Force could be chosen. Most of the 
more active items still do not include 
timelines.”
Since then, as we now know from 
Jahanian’s recent email, the Task 
Force has been steadily de?ning its 
goals and composition in increas-
ingly concrete terms. The group ?rst 
met on May 20. The entire Task Force 
is divided into ?ve working groups 
focused on campus infrastructure: 
health and well being services, cam-
pus culture and student success, pro-
fessional development for faculty and 
staff, and academic policies and prac-
tices, respectively. 
Each group is composed of dedi-
cated Task Force members, as well as 
interested volunteers from the entire 
Carnegie Mellon community. These 
groups met several times over the 
summer to “identify immediate steps 
the university might take to improve 
the CMU experience, and to consider 
long-term objectives.” This summer, 
on Aug. 11, the entire Task Force 
convened once more to discuss suc-
cessful ideas and develop priorities 
speci?cally with regard to the coming 
school year.
In a couple of short months, the 
Task Force has already taken sig-
ni?cant steps to improve the Carn-
egie Mellon experience. Instructors 
of classes all over campus have begun 
making student wellness a greater 
priority, starting with explicitly in-
cluding wellness language within 
course syllabi. Group X ?tness classes 
offered in the Cohon Center are now 
free for all students. A CMU Cares 
Resources Folder, describing ways 
a student can reach out to Carnegie 
Mellon’s support network, has been 
distributed to all faculty and staff. 
Access to CaPS has been made 
much easier, with the launch of a new 
website, increased scheduling hours, 
and the addition of ?ve new staff 
members. Finally, a special emphasis 
is being placed on the current ?rst-
year Class of 2020+, with orientation 
programs including wellness messag-
ing and outreach to parents and new 
students by President Suresh, Provost 
Jahanian, and Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno.
The Task Force’s goals going for-
ward are even more ambitious. A 
reevaluation of course workload and 
unit alignment is underway to ensure 
a course’s units realistically line up 
with the hours per week required, as 
is an academic policy review, with a 
special emphasis on reevaluating the 
existing add, drop, and withdrawal 
dates for courses. 
Faculty and staff will be trained in 
what the Task Force is calling “Men-
tal Health First Aid,” thereby giv-
ing faculty and staff a deeper regard 
for student mental health as well 
as the ability to offer counsel when 
required. The existing unconscious 
bias program being piloted by the 
College of Engineering and School of 
Comuter Science will be extended to 
students, faculty, and staff across the 
university. 
Collaborative workspaces around 
campus, referred to as “Nooks” by 
the Task Force, will be systematically 
refurbished and upgraded. Finally, 
Carnegie Mellon will tie up with 
the Jed Foundation, which offers “a 
multi-year assessment and collabo-
ration opportunity to evaluate and 
enhance [Carnegie Mellon’s] mental 
health, substance abuse, and suicide 
prevention efforts.”
In May, The Tartan expressed con-
cern that the goals outlined for the 
Task Force were too vague to inspire 
con?dence. At this point in time, due 
to the steps that have already been 
taken, and concrete steps that are 
planned for the future, the vast ma-
jority of our previous concerns have 
been put to rest. 
We’re glad to see President 
Suresh’s plans moving forward 
through the creation of actionable 
items. That said, we would still like to 
see an increase of student involvment 
in the initiative. 
For the Task Force to improve the 
student experience at Carnegie Mel-
lon, we believe that there needs to be 
a greater outreach to students that 
the Task Force is trying to serve. While 
there are several students in the work-
ing groups, there are only ?ve on the 
actual Task Force. For an issue that is 
so directly relevant to them, students 
should have a stronger voice in this 
debate than they currently do.While 
Jahanian and the Task Force welcome 
student involvement, we believe they 
might receive far more substantial 
involvement if they created greater 
awareness around the campus com-
munity about the Task Force and it’s 
actions. 
Outside of the occasional email, 
there has been no widespread con-
versation on this issue on campus. 
What we’d like to see is town halls, 
seminars, meetings, and other great-
er awareness-generation initiatives. 
We’d like to also see more collabora-
tion with student organizations.
The Task Force needs to encourage 
students to speak up and share their 
stories and ideas. In order to receive 
genuinely insightful opinions from 
the student community at large, opin-
ions need to be invited in warmer, 
more intimate settings than asking for 
online feedback.
One might expect that the stu-
dents that are the most overwhelmed 
by the Carnegie Mellon experience 
will be the last to reach out on their 
own to a Task Force with their sugges-
tions. And yet, these are the students 
that will often have the most valuable 
insights of all. Right now, there is no 
readily available information on how 
the Task Force’s membership was 
?lled. Many students were unaware 
that the positions on the Task Force 
existed until they were already ?lled. 
It is commendable that the greater 
student community now has the 
opportunity to offer feedback, but 
this opportunity should ideally have 
been provided earlier and in a more 
transparent manner. As a part of the 
Carnegie Mellon student community, 
we believe this is something that 
the majority of our peers are deeply 
passionate about. We believe that 
large parts of the student community 
would step forward with insightful 
suggestions, if only they knew where 
to direct their suggestions. We are 
happy to see that the Task Force is 
following through on its goals. We’re 
looking forwardd to see how this can 
bene?t the campus community and 
we hope that conversations of the 
postive things the Task Force is doing 
will spread beyond just emails.
CALEB GLICKMAN
Since our current election has   
hit … let’s just say a low moral 
point, I am going to do my best to 
discuss anything else in the world 
of politics. Last week we discussed 
the Electoral College, so this time I 
want to dive further into the voting 
system that the United States has 
had for over 150 years. We’ll discuss 
its precedents, alternative systems, 
and why the one we have works 
the best for our country. I’m talking 
about that much criticized system: 
?rst-past-the-post, or winner-take-
all voting.
Winner-take-all systems are just 
that the person who receives the 
most votes in an area wins the seat, 
or, in case of the presidential race, 
all of that state’s electoral votes. We 
discussed this with regards to the 
Electoral College, but by itself, win-
ner-take-all races are prevalent all 
throughout our nation at all levels 
of government. When several candi-
dates run for one of?ce, however, it 
raises the possibility that one candi-
date will win with a plurality — less 
than 50 percent of the vote.
In our modern times this has led 
to primaries and runoffs, in which 
only the top two ?nishers in the pri-
mary face off in the general election. 
This system works, but usually pri-
maries do not get as high of a turn-
out. Typically, only more involved 
and passionate voters take part.
We like to think of our country 
as a hallmark of democratic values, 
but things did not use to be so dem-
ocratic. In terms of the presidency, 
electors were selected in a variety of 
ways. There is nothing in the Con-
stitution that mandates using a win-
ner-take-all system. The nonpro?t 
organization FairVote describes how 
selection by state legislature was the 
preferred method for several de-
cades in our early history. This was 
another system that the founders es-
tablished to prevent mob rule. After 
the “corrupt bargain” in the election 
of 1824, more states shifted towards

This semester I enrolled in Con-
cepts of Mathematics, a required 
class for my anticipated Statistics 
major. Concepts is one of those 
15-112-esque Carnegie Mellon 
classes that people tout as being all-
nighter hard, life-destroying hard, 
impossibly hard.
Indeed, it is a dif?cult class: the 
math is very different from what we 
learned in high school, and it takes a 
while to get acclimated to what the 
problems ask of you. The homework 
is challenging and time-consuming, 
and some of the concepts went right 
over my head. I got good grades in 
my high school math classes, but not 
without the nagging suspicion that 
I was earning them thanks to faith, 
luck, and a little bit of pixie dust. It 
seems the jig was ?nally up: here 
was a math class that I could not fake 
my way through. When I received 
my ?rst homework score during 
recitation, I took a deep breath and 
started thinking about abandoning 
both the class and, consequently, a 
major in Statistics.
I didn’t though, because later 
that day our professor posted the 
class mean and median on Black-
board. My score may have been 
bad compared to how I’d done in 
Calc 3, but they were several points 
above the class average. I wasn’t do-
ing great — but neither was anyone 
else. Another way for me to look at 
it: if I wasn’t good at math, appar-
ently neither was about two thirds 
of the class.
If you’re a woman and this situ-
ation sounds familiar, this is no 
surprise: it is called Imposter Syn-
drome. In 1978, Pauline Clance and 
Suzanne Imes researched people 
who, “despite outstanding academic 
and professional accomplishments 
... believe that they are really not 
bright and have fooled anyone who 
thinks otherwise.” They found that 
this trait is present in women more 
frequently and with more intensity 
than with men. In general, while 
women would consider their success 
a result of either luck or hard work, 
men tended to attribute it to their in-
herent ability.
My older sister (and feminist 
hero) mentioned something similar 
to me when I was explaining to her in 
high school that I was bad at chemis-
try. She asked what my grades were 
and I admitted they were As and B-
pluses. She told me to think about 
a boy who got those same grades— 
“Would he ever say that he was bad 
at chemistry? Would he ever even 
think it?”
It’s intimidating to try and ad-
dress a problem so deeply rooted 
in gender roles. Clance and Imes 
discussed Margaret Mead’s 1949 ob-
servation that a “successful woman 
is viewed as a hostile and destruc-
tive force within society,” and how 
women have internalized it. We fear 
being successful because we fear 
being rejected by society; if we con-
vince ourselves that we aren’t really 
smart, we can ignore the fact that 
society might hate us, because it just 
doesn’t apply.
There are, however, concrete 
steps that we can take to ensure that 
Imposter Syndrome affects fewer 
women. One of the easiest is men-
tioned above: when professors re-
lease basic statistics that show per-
formance on tests and homeworks it 
enables women to stop speculating 
about their ability and see where 
they really lie. It brings us one step 
closer to a university where every-
one feels like they deserve to be 
here.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: CALL 
TO ACTION FOR CMU FACULTY
Dear Carnegie Mellon University 
faculty,
We, as a group of concerned stu-
dents of color at the university, are 
disappointed. We’re not disappoint-
ed because your of?ce hours aren’t 
long enough or your lectures lack a 
certain depth and clarity; we’re dis-
appointed because many of you have 
failed to take on the role of a faculty 
member in its entirety. As faculty 
members of the university, we expect 
you to be leaders, role models, and 
mentors. Many of you, however, have 
limited yourselves to having a strictly 
academic in?uence. To be frank, as 
students of color, we need more. 
We’re hurting, and we’re looking to 
you as our leaders to extend compas-
sion, and acknowledge the real world 
issues occurring outside of your syl-
labi.
We understand it would not be 
fair to express our disappointment 
without explicitly stating why we 
feel let down or without sharing our 
expectations for the future. As race-
related tragedies transpire across the 
nation and we are bombarded with 
imagery of heartbreaking loss, an 
undue burden is placed on our minds 
and on our hearts. When after four+ 
years of recurring injustice, we can 
only thankfully acknowledge Dr. Pe-
ter Cooke in the School of Drama and 
Dr. Jelena Kova

BRANDON SCHMUCK
As a response to Staffwriter 
Caleb Glickman’s four part series 
defending the two-party system 
in his column The Pragmatist’s 
Manifesto, I felt it necessary and 
appropriate to respond in defense 
of the independent millennial. 
The two-party system represents 
a vastly oversimpli?ed view of 
American political beliefs and has 
left millennials like myself out in the 
cold.
In Glickman’s ?rst article, he 
mentions, “Our party system is in-
nately a debate over the role of 
federal government.” However, the 
idea that the vote between liberal 
and conservative is a vote between 
more or less government is a com-
plete misconception. This is because 
the vote between Democrat and 
Republican only represents one di-
mension of the political compass.
To accurately represent all Amer-
icans, a spectrum from libertarian 
to authoritarian must be combined 
with the popular left to right. Left to 
right typically describes the govern-
ment’s involvement in a country’s 
economics. In contrast, libertarian 
to authoritarian represents a gov-
ernment’s involvement in one’s per-
sonal life. The difference between 
an authoritarian conservative and a 
libertarian conservative can be day 
and night. However, the perception 
caused by the current system would 
place them much closer than a left 
and a right libertarian. Both the Re-
publican and Democrat establish-
ments tend to lean in the authoritar-
ian direction and fail to represent 
those that want the government out 
of their lives.
Glickman goes on to say, “a multi-
party race in this country runs the 
risk of electing a president without 
full majority of support.” However, I 
would argue the current system is al-
ready doing just this. Americans are 
frustrated, and according to a recent 
Pew Research Poll, 39 percent of 
them identify as independent. Even 
more interesting is the 48 percent of 
independent millennials. With tools 
like the internet, millennials are 
starting to put their votes in their 
own hands. Last election, the most 
popular third-party candidate, Gary 
Johnson, lingered around 1 percent 
of the votes. According to the most 
recent polls, Johnson’s support has 
increased ten-fold this election. Nei-
ther Trump nor Hillary is supported 
by the majority. In fact, according 
to The New York Times, only the de-
cisions of 9 percent of Americans 
chose Trump and Clinton as the 
nominees in the primaries.
Glickman mentions in a his ?nal 
article on the two-party system that, 
“Trump has upended the two-party 
balance.” He then goes on dramati-
cally that, “Trump needs to be evis-
cerated. Completely destroyed.” His 
description is more of a decision-
less system than the ideal two-party 
system he described in the previous 
article. Trump is the ?aming dump-
ster of trash that is the two-party 
system. His success would only be 
possible in an election so molded 
into two parties that an entire party 
could hate, yet support him.
The two-party system turns the 
election into more of a childish ?n-
ger pointing game than an actual 
debate. When Katie McGinty spoke 
on campus a few weeks ago, the only 
things she had to say were about her 
rival, Pat Toomey. The debates be-
tween Trump and Clinton have also 
been more of bickering matches 
than meaningful discussions.
As someone who is genuinely 
concerned about the future of this 
nation, I urge you to vote for who 
you wish. Don’t vote for Clinton 
because you want to “eviscerate” 
Trump. Don’t vote for Trump be-
cause you hate Clinton. Vote for who 
you want to be leading the land of 
the free. The scariest thing in this 
nation is not that Clinton or Trump 
could be president in a few months; 
it is that we have allowed ourselves 
to overlook the vast ?aws of both 
candidates while trying to point the 
?nger at the other.
Even if our whole generation 
votes third-party, it probably will 
not be enough to change the out-
come of the election. However, it 
will be enough to show America 
just how frustrated millennials are 
with the current political climate. If 
Americans take time to think instead 
of giving into the desire to push 
the other candidate out, neither of 
these two-party candidates will get 
the 270 votes that they need.
popular election of electors.
This began with certain states 
changing their systems for mainly 
partisan reasons to enforce the two-
party system. Once Democratic-lean-
ing states changed their selection to 
winner-take-all system, Republican- 
(or at the time Whig-) leaning states 
would do the same.
More recently, in political races 
including the presidency, primaries 
are held to ?nd the top two candi-
dates so people can choose between 
two, preferably moderate, sides. 
This is not always the case, looking 
at our current election.
However, alternative voting strat-
egies exist, and there are a wide va-
riety of them. We will discuss two: 
Approval and Instant-Runoff Voting.
Approval Voting is simple. Any 
number of candidates run for an of-
?ce, and people can vote for as many 
as they want. Whoever wins the 
most votes wins. Simple.
Although it seems like a better 
system, there are several practi-
cal reasons why this may not work 
for our country. These two systems 
tend to lower amounts of negative 
campaigning, but as we have seen, 
campaigns get heated. If there’s one 
thing Bernie Sanders taught us, it’s 
that candidates running a positive 
campaign will sometimes turn sour 
when the going gets tough.
If multiple candidates ran from 
each major party for any of?ce on 
any level, Approval Voting could run 
the risk of “bullet voting,” or only 
voting for the candidate you care 
most about. It is realistic to think 
that candidates would encourage 
this in the heat of an election.
Each vote on these ballots is 
equally weighted. Many vot-
ers would not want 
to equally sup-
port candidates in 
practice; this leads 
itself again to plu-
rality voting as we 
have it. Approval 
Voting also does not 
eliminate the idea of 
spoiler candidates and 
would make us drop the 
idea that 50 percent plus one 
is a winning coalition, as 
many candidates might 
get more than a ma-
jority.
The next sys-
tem is Instant-
Runoff Voting, 
which is a bit 
more complicated. It requires vot-
ers to rank all of the candidates from 
favorite to least favorite. Whichever 
candidate is last after tallying every-
one’s top favorite gets eliminated, 
and those ballots move to their sec-
ond favorite. This process continues 
until a candidate gets a majority of 
votes.
Although this system can work, 
it’s not a practical solution for logisti-
cal reasons. For one, ballot counting. 
If there’s one thing that elections in 
the past have taught us about ballot 
accuracy (2000), it’s that ballots can 
be inaccurate. In addition, voting in 
the United States is drastically un-
derfunded. Realistically, counting 
these ballots quickly and then hav-
ing to ?nd a way to move millions 
of ballots to a second or third choice 
would be extremely complicated and 
time consuming. Until Congress allo-
cates more money for changing the 
way we vote in elections, adjusting 
to this system would be impossible.
Another key issue with ranked 
voting is Arrow’s Impossibility Theo-
rem. Yeah, you just got some serious 
math thrown in here, so get ready. 
Named for Nobel-Prize winning 
economist Kenneth Arrow, the Theo-
rem postulates that no ranked vot-
ing system could be designed that 
satis?es three “fairness criteria.” it 
explains these as being:
That if all voters in a group pre-
fer candidate A over candidate B, the 
group then prefers A over B.
If a candidate is eliminated, then 
the choice of candidates should 
depend on the voter’s preferences 
among the remaining candidates.
There is no single voter able to 
determine the outcome for a group.
I won’t get into the extended 
details of the proof for the Theorem, 
but you are welcome to look into it 
if you, like me, like to geek out on 
election science.
Looking at these systems brings 
up the question: How is the plurality 
voting we have better than this? Sure 
there might be faults, but it is an im-
provement.
As we have discussed at great 
length, the system established by our 
founders lent itself to a two-party 
balance. These two parties, although 
ideologically different, can be effec-
tive if they endeavor to work togeth-
er. These alternative voting systems 
do not yield to a healthy two-party 
balance.
The French sociologist Maurice 
Duverger hypothesized Duverger’s 
Law in the mid 20th century. This 
law states that plurality voting such 
as ?rst-past-the-post tends to en-
courage two-party systems. Some 
political scientists since then have 
theorized the inverse; that the two-
party system may in fact favor ?rst-
past-the-post voting.
In a situation in which candidates 
run for an of?ce with something 
other than plurality voting, there are 
a host of other threats that emerge, 
including bullet voting and strate-
gically designating candidates as 
lower preferences to ensure they do 
not get support if a voter’s ?rst pref-
erence does not win. Winner-take-all 
elections bring more voters under 
the two-party umbrella.
And again, there are too many 
logistical and ?nancial obstacles to 
implementing one of the other vot-
ing systems.
We also have to be realistic about 
how people vote. Many times, as 
this year has shown us, people 
do not vote rationally. By using 
alternative voting, we would 
run the risk of having someone 
elected who does not have real 
popular support.
I still hope that after Nov. 
8, our parties can begin to shift 
back to a degree of sanity and 
compromise. Winner-take-all is by 
no means a perfect system for 
voting. But in the United 
States, its bene?ts for a 
two-party system cannot 
be ignored.

“Saturn on Steroids” planet 400 light years away
In a paper published by 
the journal Astronomy & 
Astrophysics, researchers 
Steven Rieder and Matthew 
Kenworthy investigated the 
celestial body named J1407b, 
which is either a giant planet 
or a brown dwarf. An inter-
esting characteristic about 
J1407b is its expansive rings, 
which measure about 200 
times larger than Saturn’s 
ring system at 75 million miles 
in diameter. J1407b orbits 
around a star, much like the 
planets of our solar system 
orbit around the sun, and at 
one point in its orbit, its rings 
approach the star at a distance 
that should disrupt the ring 
system. Rieder and Kenwor-
thy propose that the lack of 
disruption is due to the rings 
spinning in the opposite di-
rection of J1407b’s orbit. This 
hypothesis would explain the 
rings’ stability, but now Rieder 
and Kenworthy must rational-
ize how the rings can possibly 
spin in the other direction.

Virus steals black widow’s poisonous genes
A virus called WO, which is 
classi?ed as a bacteriophage, 
appears to have copied the 
genetic codes of latrotoxin, 
the poison of a black widow 
spider. WO targets a bacte-
rium named Wolbachia, which 
infects insect and spider cells.
Up until now, it was 
thought that bacteriophages 
only steal DNA from bac-
teria, so this new insight is 
especially surprising. 
Because latrotoxin can 
break down cell membranes, 
the researchers hypothesize 
that the virus uses this toxin in 
order to penetrate cell mem-
branes and reach the bacteria 
living inside of animals. The 
latrotoxin may also allow the 
virus to exit cells as it needs to. 
Researchers Sarah and Seth 
Bordenstein from Vanderbilt 
University published the re-
sults of their analysis of the 
WO genome in the journal 
Nature Communications.

Ketamine as a new, possibly better drug to treat depression
Depression is still a vastly 
misunderstood disorder that 
researchers are working to de-
mystify. For the most part, sci-
entists have hypothesized that 
depression is caused by low 
levels of monoamines, chemi-
cals that act as neurotrans-
mitters in the brain. Drugs 
like Prozac boost the level of 
monoamines in order to treat 
the symptoms of depression. 
However, another type of 
drug, ketamine, which histori-
cally has been used for anes-
thetics, is rising. Ketamine 
has worked for 75 percent of 
patients who did not respond 
to other forms of treatment, 
and it works much faster than 
drugs like Prozac, which may 
take months. Ketamine does 
not primarily affect mono-
amines, so scientists must 
ascertain whether low mono-
amines levels are really the 
cause of depression, and how 
the functions of ketamine can 
be modeled to possibly create 
a new kind of antidepressant.

Jumping spiders detect sounds three meters away
Not only do jumping spi-
ders have stellar vision, but 
they also apparently have 
great hearing capabilities. Re-
searchers at Cornell University 
used metal microelectrodes to 
show that the spiders’ audi-
tory neurons can sense sounds 
up to 600 spider body lengths 
away. When they stimulated 
the spiders’ hairs on their legs 
and body, the same auditory 
neurons ?red, demonstrat-
ing that the hairs detect na-
noscale air particles excited by 
sound waves. The researchers 
also found that the spiders 
are extremely sensitive to 90 
Hz frequency, which is near 
the frequency of wing beats 
of parasitic wasps, which are 
jumping spiders’ greatest en-
emy. When exposed to 90 Hz 
sounds, eighty percent of the 
spiders in the experiment 
froze before trying to escape, 
which is a classic defense 
mechanism. The full study can 
be found in the journal Cur-
rent Biology.

Prosthetics that send feedback to the user
Historically, prosthetics 
could only receive commands 
from their wearers. 
Robert Gaunt and a group 
of researchers at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh are working 
towards developing a new 
prosthetic that not only re-
ceives commands, but also 
gives feedback. 
Gaunt is researching ways 
to send natural sensations to 
someone wearing a prosthetic. 
After the ?rst six months 
of his experiment, his patient, 
who had lost the ability to use 
his hands, could identify the 
correct ?nger being touched 
84 percent of the time wearing 
a prosthesis. 
The issues included the pa-
tient feeling sensations from 
below the skin and not being 
able to feel his ?ngertips. De-
spite the current roadblocks, 
the outlook is optimistic. 
Currently Gaunt and his re-
searchers are 18 months into 
the experiment.

Google begins fact-checking its content
Google launched its new 
fact check tag just in time for 
the upcoming election. 
Now, users will be able to 
see fact check labels next to 
news articles on Google News, 
in addition to the labels denot-
ing opinion, related, and local 
articles. 
This is an effort to help us-
ers distinguish between fact 
and ?ction, which is an in-
creasingly prevalent problem, 
particularly on the Internet. 
Google is not by any means 
a pioneer in the ?eld, however. 
Many sites, including BBC,

Last Thursday, Oct. 13, 
Carnegie Mellon University 
had the honor of co-hosting 
the 2016 White House Fron-
tiers Conference along with 
the University of Pittsburgh.
According to its website, 
the goal of The White House 
Frontiers Conference is to 
“bring together some of the 
world’s innovators in Pitts-
burgh to discuss how science 
and technology frontiers will 
help improve lives, includ-
ing progress and investments 
that are keeping America and 
Americans on the cutting edge 
of innovation.” The Confer-
ence was broken down into 
?ve main tracts – Personal, 
Local, National, Global, and 
Interplanetary, with exhibits 
featuring each one.
There were seven exhib-
its featured in the Personal 
tract. These included “Re-
storing Movement and Touch 
with Brain Interfaces,” “Using 
Games to Map the Brain,” 
“Mapping the Brain through 
Citizen Neuroscientists,” “Di-
agnosing Mental Illness with 
Multimodal Behavior Percep-
tion,” “Developing Continu-
ous Patient Monitoring for 
Cardiovascular Health,” “En-
hancing Science and Discov-
ery with Ultra-Low-Cost Paper 
Microscopes,” and “Engaging 
Citizens with the Precision 
Medicine Initiative.”
“Diagnosing Mental Illness 
with Multimodal Behavior 
Perception” was an exhibit run 
by Carnegie Mellon University 
that showcased MultiSense, 
a behavior-sensing technol-
ogy that helps clinicians diag-
nose several mental illnesses, 
including depression, post-
traumatic stress disorder, and 
schizophrenia. 
MultiSense can detect 
subtle changes in a patient, in-
cluding facial expression and 
vocal prosody, that identify 
behavior indicators of mental 
illness. The system can then 
HOW THINGS WORK
Hurricanes are powerful, yet destructive forces of nature

There had not been 
a Category 5 hurri-
cane in the Atlan-
tic since 2007 
until Hurricane 
Matthew struck 
Caribbean is-
lands and the 
southeastern 
United States earli-
er this month, causing 
serious damage to life 
and property. The high 
winds, intense rain, and 
deadly ?ooding associ-
ated with the hurricane 
were demonstrations of 
our planet’s uncontrol-
lable power. 
How exactly is a storm 
so powerful formed? What 
makes a hurricane capable 
of so much damage? 
It may be surprising to 
see that the reason be-
hind all of this isn’t so 
different from the reason 
behind the weather we 
experience in Pittsburgh.
Hurricane Matthew, like 
all other hurricanes that af-
fect the eastern coast of the 
United States, is an Atlantic 
hurricane. Atlantic hurricanes 
form just off the western coast 
of Africa, in the Atlantic Basin, 
which is one of the seven trop-
ical cyclone basins. 
The Inter-Tropical Zone 
located near the equator is 
the region where the north-
east and southeast trade 
winds collide. Between June 
1 and Nov. 30, the winds of 
this zone shift a continual 
line of storms down to the 
equator all around the globe. 
Just as low-pressure 
systems follow the jet stream 
across the United States and 
are the reason behind the 
dreary cloudy days and rain 
of Pittsburgh, hurricane 
storm systems start as low-
pressure systems slowly mov-
ing across this line.
Depending on the ocean’s 
conditions, certain storms 
begin to gain strength. 
Deep warm water, large 
amounts of moisture in the 
air, and limited vertical 
wind shear can lead to this 
intensification.

As the Arctic ice begins to 
melt, the way humans inter-
act with the Arctic is changing 
rapidly. 
Resources in the Arctic are 
more accessible and commer-
cial cruises through the Arctic 
Circle are now possible. 
In response to the chang-
ing geography, President 
Obama recommended that 
Congress fund a ?eet of ice-
breaker ships for the Coast 
Guard. 
The environmental and 
geopolitical impacts of such 
an undertaking could help 
the United States adapt to the 
new realities of the Arctic or 
cause signi?cant problems for 
America down the line.
Icebreakers are large ships 
with reinforced hulls and a 
shape that allows them to 
slide up onto ice and then 
come down and break the ice. 
They must be powerful 
enough to actually break the 
ice in order to be considered 
an icebreaker.
The melting of Arctic ice 
has allowed for ships to car-
ry cargo through the Arctic, 
creating much more ef?cient 
trade routes between Europe 
and Asia. 
The Northwest Passage 
that Europeans searched 
for in the 1400s has become 
accessible. 
These trade routes will 
be most usable by countries 
with icebreaker ?eets because 
the ice must be broken up for 
cargo ships to pass through 
safely. 
Referring to the gap 
between American and Rus-
sian icebreaker ?eets, Senator 
Dan Sullivan (R-AK) has said 
that “the highways of the Arc-
tic are paved by icebreakers. 
Right now, the Russians 
have superhighways, and 
we have dirt roads and 
potholes.”
There are also military 
implications to having ice-
breakers. Strategic points in 
the Arctic will be more acces-
sible or more easily defended 
when countries are able to get 
their ships to those points. 
However, with American 
and Russian relations reach-
ing what former Soviet lead-
er Mikhail Gorbachev has 
described as an “dangerous 
point,” it is probably best not 
to appear as if we are escalat-
ing our military involvement 
in an area where Russia might 
be vulnerable.
Further, shipments of 
heating fuel or other supplies 
to places like Alaska in the 
Arctic can be hazardous. 
Having icebreakers ready to 
respond to trapped 
ships can help 
rescue the crew 
and recover 
the cargo. 
It can be dif-
?cult for planes 
and helicopters to 
take over these mis-
sions due to the 
terrible visibility. 
Further,    ice 
can severely 
damage a plane 
or helicopter 
much faster than 
a boat and is 
harder to get off 
the plane.
On the other 
hand, icebreakers 
may be problematic 
for the environment. 
Mass use of ice-
breakers could 
break ice to the 
point that it melts 
at a noticeably 
faster rate. 
The introduc-
tion of things like 
cruise ships and 
cargo ships could 
also damage 
the envi-
ronment 
due to 
things 
like 
emis-
sions 
and 
faulty 
waste manage-
ment.
Icebreakers 
also are dam-
aging to the Arctic 
ecosystem. 
Beluga whales, for 
instance, face signi?cant 
disruptions from noise due to 
icebreakers. 
This could disrupt many 
cold water mammals and 
have far reaching impacts that 
are dif?cult to predict. 
Seemingly minor ecologi-
cal damage has had severe 
impacts 
before 
and 
we 
haven’t 
had much 
to do his-
torically in 
the Arctic.
If icebreak-
ers are damaging, 
though, it’s unclear ex-
actly how to stop them. 
While a treaty around the 
arctic could exist similar to the 
Outer Space Treaty and Ant-
arctic Treaty, this treaty would 
be very dif?cult to enforce. 
The Outer Space Treaty is 
hard to enforce, but it’s also 
very dif?cult to break due to 
the dif?culty of development 
in outer space. 
The Antarctic is not par-
ticularly strategic to take ad-
vantage of, so most countries 
don’t have reason to violate 
this treaty. The interests of 
countries in the Arctic will 
make enforcement an impor-
tant concern that could be 
very dif?cult.
Icebreakers are an impor-
tant adaptation to climate 
change and the melting of 
Arctic ice, but they do not 
come without problems. 
It’s important to consider 
whether we should mitigate 
or adapt to climate change, 
but we also must be careful 
to consider our actions and 
ensure that they aren’t 
accelerating the 
problem.

New omnidirectional robot utilizes only two moving parts
JOSH ANDAH
Staffwriter
Researchers always strive 
for ef?ciency in their robotic 
designs. Achieving this goal 
proves to be quite the chal-
lenge, however, as the de-
mand for more moving parts 
and power in modern robots 
increases. 
Nonetheless, the Hollis 
research group at Carnegie 
Mellon University demon-
strated that this trend need 
not be the case by engineering 
the Spherical Induction Motor 
robot (SIMbot), a robot that 
balances on a single spherical 
ball bearing.
The SIMbot consists of 
only two moving parts — its 
vertical body and a rotor 
for movement. 
The body of the SIMbot 
rests atop the rotor like a pen 
atop a ballpoint, and stands 
about six feet tall. 
The hollow metal rotor, 
coated with poly-urethane, 
spins under the body in all 
directions, albeit with some 
friction from the bearings it 
is connected to; Hollis sug-
gested in an article for CMU 
News that future iterations 
of the robot could essentially 
eliminate friction by replac-
ing these ball bearings with a 
thin cushion of air.
The SIMbot uses 
fascinating technology to 
function. Motion in the rotor 
is induced by actuators and 
rollers that can be adjusted 
to change spinning direction 
and yaw (i.e. the spinning 
motion of the rotor about 
a vertical axis); the robot 
achieves brisk walking speeds 
with this. 
The robot also expends 
energy to keep itself bal-
anced and to return to the 
upright position. This makes 
it dif?cult to tip over the ro-
bot, even after being kicked 
and shoved. 
It uses an Inertial 
Measuring Unit to detect its 
body orientation and correct 
it; the measuring unit may 
be replaced by a gyroscope in 
other versions of the ballbot. 
In the unlikely case of a 
system failure, the SIMbot has 
three legs that it can rest on for 
support. 
Recent graduate Greg 
Seyfarth, who obtained a 
master’s degree in Carnegie 
Mellon’s Robotics Institute, 
wrote his thesis on the devel-
opment and inner workings of 
the SIMbot, which gets much 
more technical.
Robotics Institute research 
professor Ralph Hollis de-
signed the ballbot, on which 
the SIMbot is based, in 2005. 
He then patented the design 
some years later. 
To add to this, Professor 
Masaaki Kumagai of Tohoku 
Gakuin University in Japan 
and EHP Zurich also made es-
sential leaps in the SIM ?eld 
with the BalllP robot and 
Rezero robots, respectively.
The SIMbot differs from 
the conventional robot in 
many ways. Other robots of-
ten have much lower centers 
of gravity and slower accelera-
tion and deceleration capabili-
ties to avoid tipping. 
If they do have wheels, 
they usually number no less 
than three, to ensure stability. 
Furthermore, whereas 
other robots need to produce 
yaw to turn, the SIMbot simply 
changes the direction of rota-
tion of the rotor, allowing it to 
turn in any direction.
The SIMbot opens offers 
unique advantages in sev-
eral ?elds. Such technol-
ogy could be harnessed 
in medical ?elds, package 
delivery, and locomotion. 
Degrees of Freedom (DOF) 
arms can be added to the ver-
tical body to equip the robot 
with more capabilities, as was 
done on the allbot in 2011, 
making it the only ballbot in 
the world with arms. 
Thanks to its fewer moving 
parts, the SIMbot would be 
easier to maintain and pro-
duce, making it a viable option 
for such varying ?elds. 
In a university press 
release, Hollis commented 
on the ?nancial bene?t of the 
SIMbot, stating “This motor 
relies on a lot of electronics 
and software. Electronics and 
software are getting cheaper. 
Mechanical systems are not 
getting cheaper, or at least 
not as fast as electronics and 
software are.”
The SIMbot shows us what 
innovation in engineering at 
Carnegie Mellon can achieve. 
It overcomes many of the limi-
tations of conventional robots, 
while also offering newfound 
technology and opportunity.
“Even without optimiz-
ing the motor’s performance, 
SIMbot has demonstrated im-
pressive performance,” Hol-
lis said in the same univer-
sity press release. “We expect 
SIMbot technology will make 
ballbots more accessible and 
more practical for wide adop-
tion.”
This research was 
supported by the National Sci-
ence Foundation and Grants-
in-Aid for Scienti?c Research 
(KAKENHI) in Japan.
It would be unsurprising 
to see the spread of Hollis and 
his research group’s technol-
ogy, possibly to consumer 
markets, in the coming years 
— something I suggest we all 
look out for.

Icebreakers break through Arctic ice
Wind shear is the differ-
ence in wind velocity be-
tween two points. Low wind 
shear means that the winds 
don’t “turn” or stay stable, 
which allows the hurricane 
to strengthen. As conditions 
become favorable for storm 
growth, the low-pressure 
systems begin to develop 
distinct characteristics. 
As increased wind speed 
and counter-clockwise ro-
tation become more pro-
nounced, a tropical depres-
sion becomes a tropical 
storm. The tropical storm 
then becomes a Category 1 
hurricane, increasing from 
Category 1 to Category 5 to 
match the logarithmic in-
crease in storm strength.
The clear “eye” of the 
hurricane forms from a 
vacuum in the center of 
the hurricane. The walls of 
this calm center have the 
fastest speeds; this con-
cept could be thought of 
as related to conservation 
of momentum. 
Large rain bands form, 
often extending hundreds 
of miles outside the hur-
ricane eye. While the hur-
ricane forms, the low-pres-
sure system continues to 
move in translation. 
The global winds, along 
with rotation from the 
earth’s pressure systems, 
combine to direct the hur-
ricane, with high pressures 
rotating clockwise and low 
pressures rotating counter-
clockwise. 
In the case of Hurricane 
Matthew, as it began mov-
ing north along the south-
ern United States coastline, 
a cold front, which refers 
to a line of colder wind, 
pushed eastward against 
the storm, keeping it along 
the coast instead of above 
land.
Each part of a hurricane 
contributes its own danger-
ous element. The wide and 
extensive rain bands deposit 
large amounts of rain for 
long periods of time. 
For Hurricane Matthew, 
this was a serious issue in 
South Carolina where more 
than ten inches of rain fell 
during the storm and deadly 
flooding resulted.The coun-
terclockwise rotation of the 
bands creates winds of dif-
fering directions in each 
quadrant of the hurricane. 
In the northeast quarter 
of the storm, the nature of 
the bands can often lead to 
tornadoes when they reach 
land. When the direction of 
the winds lines against the 
coast, the continual high 
winds actually push water 
from the ocean farther into 
land. 
This storm surge was a 
very serious complication of 
Hurricane Sandy in 2012, 
increasing water levels and 
?ooding large parts of New 
York City.
Categories are assigned 
to hurricanes based on their 
wind-speeds. Category 5 
hurricane winds are sus-
tained at more than 157 
miles per hour. 
This intensity in speed 
causes catastrophic dam-
age to trees, buildings, and 
homes. The winds move 
fastest closest to the eye-
wall, thus the Category 4 
Hurricane Matthew’s shift 
away from the coast of Flor-
ida may have saved the state 
from a grimmer outcome. 
The eye-wall did even-
tually reach land in South 
Carolina, but the hurricane 
had weakened to a Category 
1 storm by that time.
When hurricanes transi-
tion from the sea to the land, 
they lose the moist air and 
encounter rugged terrain. 
This signi?cantly weak-
ens the storms; but be-
fore this, they are able to 
cause incredible damage.
However, due to in-
creased weather-sensing 
technology, hurricanes can 
now be tracked in real time. 
This provides valuable in-
formation that can be used 
to predict when people need 
to be evacuated from their 
homes and how much poten-
tial damage will result from 
the hurricane. For Hurricane 
Matthew, thousands of peo-
ple in the United States were 
urged to evacuate, including 
people in Florida, Georga, 
and South Caroline, where 
risks for ?ooding were most 
extreme.
The primary technology 
for monitoring hurricanes 
continues to be weather sat-
ellites and planes with spe-
cial weather-sensing equip-
ment. The data is then fed 
into supercomputers con-
taining programs that can 
project a model trajectory of 
the hurricane.
Though deadly, 
hurricanes remain marvels 
of nature. The energy that 
pulls a roof off of a house on 
the coast is the same energy 
that is being removed from 
the heat of the ocean. 
These storms balance 
some of the ocean’s heat 
and sometimes the result 
is catastrophic. But looking 
beyond the damage caused, 
these storms are a powerful, 
almost respectable feature of 
nature.
Storms are strong and inspire awe

be used to track the progress 
of a patient.
There were ?ve exhibits 
featured in the Local tract. 
These included “Learning 
Practices of Making,” “Using 
Flying Machines to Assess In-
frastructure in Hard-to-Reach 
Locations,” “Addressing Social 
Need through Assistive Tech-
nology Innovations,” “Display-
ing Autonomous Vehicles over 
Time,” and “Inspiring Girls 
through Robotics.”
Carnegie Mellon hosted 
the exhibits “Using Flying 
Machines to Assess Infra-
structure in Hard-to-Reach 
Locations,” which showcased 
an autonomous flying-ma-
chine system developed by 
Carnegie Mellon’s Field Ro-
botics Center to improve the 
efficiency, fidelity, and safety 
of current critical-infrastruc-
ture inspection methods; 
“Displaying Autonomous 
Vehicles over Time,” which 
showcased the evolution of 
autonomous vehicles, includ-
ing the 1984 Terragator, the 
2007 DARPA Urban Grand 
Challenger winner Boss, and 
a research vehicle integrat-
ing autonomous systems into 
a Cadillac SRX; and “Inspir-
ing Girls through Robotics,” 
which showcased a chassis 
building kit constructed by 
Girls of Steel Robotics, a K-12 
outreach program run by the 
Field Robotics Center.
For the “Inspiring Girls 
through Robotics” exhibit, 
members of the Girls of Steel 
Robotics Team displayed their 
projects and talked about the 
barriers to getting girls into 
Robotics and STEM. 
The team was founded at 
Carnegie Mellon in the fall of 
2010 and is mentored by an 
array of faculty from across 
engineering disciplines to 
mentor high school girls and 
show that the field of robot-
ics is within their reach. 
Each year the team com-
petes at the FIRST robotics 
competition and spends the 
6 weeks between the release 
of the challenge and the com-
petition frantically building 
their complex models. 
The team displayed these 
robots as well as their “easy 
to assemble” robot made 
by middle school girls men-
tored by the high school 
team members. 
They also discussed how 
they had never before consid-
ered careers in engineering, 
but they now considerm STEM 
and engineering a strong pos-
sibility for their future. They 
are excitedly plotting the next 
FIRST conference.
There were four exhibits 
featured in the National tract. 
These included “Snake Robot 
and Snake Monster,” “CoBot 
Service Robots,” “The Mo-
bility Enhancement Robotic 
Wheelchair,” and “The Social-
ly Aware Robot Assistant.”
Carnegie Mellon hosted 
the exhibits “Snake Robot 
and Snake Monster,” which 
demoed two biologically in-
spired robots that can navi-
gate to places that humans 
can’t reach, such as threading 
through tight spaces and navi-
gating rough terrains; “CoBot 
Service Robots,” which show-
cased the autonomous mobile-
service robots developed by 
Carnegie Mellon’s CORAL 
lab that have been navigating 
the Gates-Hillman Complex 
for the past three years; and 
“The Socially Aware Robot As-
sistant,” which showcased a 
robot that uses arti?cial intel-
ligence to pair each task goal 
with a social goal in order to 
personalize interaction and 
improve task performance.
The four exhibits featured 
in the Global tract included 
“Energy Inventor Labs,” 
“Climate Playground,” “Wave 
Energy Prize,” and “Geoscience 
Data Visualization.”
The four exhibits featured 
in the Interplanetary tract in-
cluded “Hyperwall,” “Journey 
to Mars,” “Laser Interferom-
eter Gravitational-Wave Ob-
servatory,” and “Commercial 
Crew.”
The common emphasis 
across all of the exhibits fea-
tured in these different tracts 
was that technology will help 
build our future. In part, Carn-
egie Mellon hosted a number 
of exhibits because of the con-
venient location. However, 
there is also some incredible, 
cutting-edge technology be-
ing developed here that will 
undoubtedly shape the future.
As Carnegie Mellon’s 
biography on The White House 
Frontiers Conference website 
says, “CMU doesn’t imagine 
the future, we create it.”

SPORTS BRIEFS
Women’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team traveled 
to the University of Rochester 
on Friday and defeated the 
home team Yellowjackets 2–1 
in overtime. This win brings 
the Tartans to a tie at the top 
of the UAA standings with a 
2–1 record, and they improve 
to 9–3–1 overall on the season 
with this win.
Rochester struck the ?rst 
blow in the middle of the 
fourth minute when a Yel-
lowjacket player gathered a 
rebound and launched the ball 
past the Tartan goalkeeper.
It took most of the game 
before the Tartans managed to 
?nd their ?rst opportunity to 
score. The Tartans remained 
down by one point until the 
72nd minute when sophomore 
Katja Bracklemanns-Puig sent 
a left-footed shot into the top 
corner of the goal after an as-
sist from ?rst-year Sydney 
Webber.
Regulation time ended and 
the game was still tied 1–1. 
That all changed in the 96th 
minute when junior forward 
Haili Adams scored her second 
game-winning goal of the sea-
son. The play was assisted by 
senior Amelia Clark, who sent 
a long pass down the ?eld that 
was gathered by Adams before 
she sent the ball to the back of 
the net. The goal ended the 
game with the Tartans up 2–1.
Men’s soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team took the ?eld at 
the University of Rochester on 
Friday, and the Tartans were 
defeated in a nail-biting match 
by a score of 3–2. This was the 
second loss of the year for the 
Tartans, moving their overall 
record to 9–2–1.
The Tartans scored ?rst 
when sophomore Antho-
ny Gulli sent a corner kick 
straight into the goal for his 
fourth score of the season. 
Rochester matched that score 
in the 53rd minute, and then 
took the lead for themselves 
less than two minutes later 
with another goal.
The Tartans did not give up, 
however. In the 77th minute, 
sophomore Zack Masciopinto 
scored off a free kick from 
sophomore Philip Petrakian. 
The Tartans could not hold 
on to the game, though. Less 
than two minutes later, the 
Yellowjackets scored again af-
ter a long scuf?e in the goalie 
box. The Tartans had multiple 
shots on goal in the end of the 
game but none were success-
ful, and the Tartans dropped 
the contest 3–2.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball team traveled to Beaver 
Falls, Pennsylvania on Sat-
urday to take on Geneva Col-
lege in a President’s Athletic 
Conference (PAC) game and 
dominated the Golden Torna-
does with a 29–10 victory to 
improve their record to 3–3 on 
the season, 3–2 in PAC play.
Geneva actually scored ?rst 
in the game with a ?eld goal, 
but Carnegie Mellon answered 
quickly at the end of the ?rst 
quarter with a one-yard touch-
down run from junior Sam 
Benger. The Tartans added 
onto their lead at the end of 
the ?rst half as sophomore 
quarterback Alex Cline com-
pleted a ?ve-yard pass to ju-
nior Tommy Mans?eld. Senior 
placekicker Gabe Renna then 
put a ?eld goal on the board to 
put the Tartans up 17–3 in the 
third quarter. Geneva man-
aged to score a touchdown on 
their next drive, but then the 
Tartans really turned up the 
heat. Renna scored with an-
other ?eld goal, and on the en-
suing drive sophomore Long 
Tran recovered a Geneva fum-
ble and gave the ball back to 
the Tartans. On the ?rst play 
of the Tartan offensive drive, 
Cline found junior Alex Froim-
zon in the endzone to put the 
?nal nail in Geneva’s cof?n. 
The Golden Tornadoes added 
insult to injury by snapping a 
ball out of the endzone and 
giving the Tartans an addi-
tional two points on a safety.
The Tartans’ next competi-
tion will be at home against 
Thiel College. The game is 
scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 
22 at 1 p.m.
Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon vol-
leyball team competed in 
the second University Ath-
letic Association (UAA) round 
robin on Saturday, hosted by 
Brandeis University. The Tar-
tans played two games and 
went 1–1 on the day, improv-
ing their record to 17–5 overall 
and 2–3 in UAA play.
In the ?rst match against 
New York University, the Tar-
tans won with scores of 25–11,

four service aces. Senior Emily 
Newton had 29 assists and 
?rst-year Kayla Yew was the 
top defender for the Tartans 
with 13 digs.
In the second match 
against Emory, the Tartans 
dropped the ?rst set 25–18

ond and winning 25–22. The 
Eagles won the ?nal two sets, 
27–25 and 25–20 to defeat the 
Tartans. 
Mueller was at the top of 
the offensive statistics again

two block assists. Newton 
had 39 assists and 11 digs. 
Senior libero Molly Higgins re-
corded 26 digs for the match, 
and passed 2,000 total digs

The Tartan fantasy football league stumbles into Week 5
INDIA PRICE
Online Editor
It’s tradition in The Tar-
tan Fantasy Football League 
to make the biggest loser of 
the week hang up their jer-
sey in shame and write the 
recap article. However, week 
?ve was pretty interesting. 
This was the ?rst week I de-
cided to do something drastic 
that I had not yet considered: 
try. Torment from my fellow 
team owners convinced me 
that I could at least bench 
players with negative pro-
jected scores. Sports Editor 
Alex Wood’s starting lineup 
consisted of two tight ends, a 
running back, and the entire 
Seahawks defense on their bye 
week. 
Despite the fact that my en-
tire team played and that I ac-
tually tried for once, I still only 
narrowly swooped in for sec-
ond to last over Wood. Quan-
titatively Wood is the biggest 
loser, but I will bow out grace-
fully as to not cause myself any 
more humiliation and to re-
lieve Wood of another article. 
So without further ado, here’s 
the fantasy football week ?ve 
recap, as told by the owner of 
the worst quality team in the 
fantasy football league.
Distressed Donkeys over 
Plaidie Daddies 105–86 
Going into the week ?ve 
matchup against Pillbox 
Editor Abhishek Tayal’s Dis-
tressed Donkeys was nerve-
wracking for me. Pittsburgh 
Steeler’s quarterback Ben Ro-
ethlisberger put up 34 points 
the week prior against the 
New York Jets and I was wor-
ried about a repeat scenario.  
As a Pittsburgh native, I took 
it pretty personally when 
Steelers’ quarterback Ben 
Roethlisberger and running 
back Le’Veon Bell handed the 
Distressed Donkeys 29 and 
23 points respectively. To my 
demise, New York Giants quar-
terback Eli Manning scraped 
me up a mere nine total 
points. The Plaidie Daddies’ 
top scorers were Denver Bron-
cos wide receiver Emmanuel 
Sanders, who brought in 15 
points against the Falcons, 
and Baltimore Ravens tight 
end Dennis Pitta, who brought 
in 12. Unfortunately, the Plai-
die Daddies left 51 points on 
the bench and didn’t stand a 
chance against Roethlisberger 
and Bell, nor could they pull 
more points than San Diego 
wide receiver Travis Benja-
min, who managed to run the 
ball 117 yards, snagging the 
Distressed Donkeys another 
18 points. The Distressed Don-
keys took the W over the Plai-
die Daddies, 105–86.
Dreamland Warriors over 
extremely dank team 124–72
This rivalry was a heated 
one. Sports Editor Alex Wood 
versus Assistant Sports Editor 
Ian Tanaya. Unfortunately, 
and maybe even unknowingly 
for Wood, he started a team 
that would go on to only play 
?ve players. Despite extremely 
dank team grabbing onto 33 
points from this week’s league 
top scorer, wide receiver T.Y. 
Hilton of the Indianapolis 
Colts, Tanaya’s Dreamland 
Warriors still boasted a 52- 
point lead at the end of the 
week. Key players for Tanaya 
this week were Chicago Bears 
running back Jordan Howard 
and Arizona Cardinals wide 
receiver Larry Fitzgerald. 
Howard ?nished the week 
with 118 rushing yards and 
a touchdown, for 24 points. 
Fitzgerald completed six re-
ceptions from quarterback 
Drew Stanton, pulling in 26 
points. Other notable Dream-
land Warriors performances 
came from San Diego wide re-
ceiver Tyrell Williams, who set 
a career high in yards against 
the Raiders, and Buffalo Bills 
running back LeSean McCoy, 
who rushed an impressive 150 
yards against Los Angeles.
What is going on? over Mr. 
Rodger’s Neighborhood 
132–102 
Regardless of the fact that 
Forum Editor Sinead Foley 
literally did not know what 
was going on, she put up an 
impressive victory over Opera-
tions Manager Jade Crockem’s 
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood. 
Arizona Cardinals running 
back David Johnson gained 
What is going on? 32 points 
after rushing an impactful 157 
yards. Indianapolis Colts quar-
terback Andrew Luck threw 
for two touchdowns against 
Chicago, handing Foley anoth-
er 21 points. What is going on? 
also saw strong performances 
from wide receivers Randall 
Cobb of the Green Bay packers 
and DeAndrew Hopkins of the 
Houston Texans, who earned 
19 and 16 points respectively. 
Crockem’s performance can-
not be discounted, however. 
Dallas Cowboys running back 
Ezekiel Elliott handed Mr. 
Rodger’s Neighborhood a 
strong 31 points. Denver wide 
receiver Demarylus Thomas 
and Green Bay QB Aaron Rod-
gers, both snagged an amica-
ble 15 points for Mr. Rodger’s 
Neighborhood.
Flaming Bears over How 
does this work? 148–140
After ?guring out the gist 
of what was going on, Foley’s 
performance improved im-
mensely. But Layout Manager 
Zeke Rosenberg was hard 
to rival in week ?ve, with 
all but Arizona kicker Chan-
dler Catanzaro throwing up 
double digit scores. The high-
est score from Rosenberg this 
week came from Carolina 
tight end Greg Olsen, who put 
up 27 points against Tampa 
Bay. Pittsburgh wide receiver 
Antonio Brown also had a 
strong week, completing nine 
receptions for 78 yards and 
22 points against the Jets. 
Though she suffered a loss to 
Rosenberg, Foley’s team put 
up the second-highest score in 
the league thanks to impres-
sive displays from Colts kicker 
Adam Vinatieri, 49ers running 
back Carlos Hyde, and Bengals 
QB Andy Dalton, all offering 
up over 20 points.
Masshole Knickerbock-
ers over McManus’s Anus 
108–97 
Former Personnel Manager 
Lula Beresford put up her ?rst 
W this week against Publisher 
Sarah Gutekunst. Both teams 
fought hard, but the Masshole 
Knickerbockers pushed ahead 
thanks to Patriots QB Tom 
Brady (sigh), who completed 
406 yards against Cleveland 
in his season debut for a total 
of 29 points. Oakland wide 
receiver Amari Cooper did 
his part for the Knickbock-
ers, bringing in 138 yards for 
27 points overall. McManus’s 
Anus had a slightly rougher 
week, leaving over 40 points 
on the bench. Some notable 
performances, however, came 
from Detroit QB Matthew 
Stafford and New England 
tight end Rob Gronkowski 
who scored 18 and 15 points 
respectively. 
Going into week six, I’m 
determined to get back on my 
A-game. I’ve got some tough 
competition against the 4–1 
Flaming Bears, but I’m hoping 
that my newly acquired Steel-
ers defense can bring it home 
for me. I’m also excited to see 
how Crockem and Gutekunst 
navigate what is likely to be 
the most heated matchup of 
the season.
Senior Luke McDonald has brain and braun on the ?eld
Rozenvasser takes fourth in national tennis tournament
JADE CROCKEM
Operations Manager
For Tartan athletes, it’s 
just as important to be a good 
athlete on the ?eld as it is off. 
This especially holds true for 
senior neuroscience major 
and offensive lineman, Luke 
McDonald. Born and raised in 
Lancaster County, he’s been 
passionate about football 
from a young age. 
“I started playing in the 
third grade. I had been play-
ing football for as long as I can 
remember,” McDonald said in 
an interview with The Tartan. 
Growing up around football 
encouraged McDonald to con-
tinue the legacy in his family. 
“My dad played in high school 
and he coached with my un-
cle, who played at Bucknell 
in college. My grandfather 
played college football at 
Michigan State.” 
It was only natural for Mc-
Donald to pick up where the 
other players in his family left 
off, on the football ?eld.
McDonald is just as pas-
sionate about what happens 
on the ?eld as he is about 
what happens off the ?eld. 
“I am really passionate about 
coaching football,” McDon-
ald said as he spoke about his 
experience coaching with his 
father. “My dad is the head 
coach at Elizabethtown High 
School and I have coached 
with him over the past two 
summers.” The most reward-
ing part of this process for 
McDonald is being able to 
share his knowledge of foot-
ball with those who are in the 
same shoes he was in just a 
few years ago, “Imparting my 
knowledge to high school kids 
and seeing them take what I 
have taught them and use it to 
succeed” (McDonald’s favor-
ite part about coaching.) This 
perspective gives McDonald 
a chance to re?ect on his ex-
perience on the ?eld while 
also helping younger players 
succeed. Having this experi-
ence allows McDonald to un-
derstand football from more 
than just the viewpoint of the 
player.
For McDonald, being a 
good athlete extends beyond 
the ?eld. McDonald knows 
how important being part of a 
team is and how essential it is 
to act for the good of the team 
rather than just for his own 
interests. “Being a good ath-
lete, on the ?eld, means be-
ing responsible for your job, 
and doing your job to the best 
of your ability for the good 
of the team.” Being part of a 
team is about being a part of 
something bigger than your-
self, and McDonald carries 
these same sentiments into 
his personal and academic 
life. “Off the ?eld, being an 
athlete means representing 
your team and school in the 
best way, and excelling at ev-
erything you can.” McDonald 
understands the importance 
of portraying himself in a way 
that will re?ect positively on 
the team. For McDonald, foot-
ball is more than just a sport; 
it’s a way to recover from the 
stress of classes. Carnegie 
Mellon can be a stressful envi-
ronment, and for McDonald, 
“football is a release, a way to 
escape schoolwork and stress 
that happens here at CMU.” 
It’s also a way for McDonald 
to “unite with my friends and 
teammates for a common 
goal, to win.” Football has 
really taught McDonald the 
importance of what it means 
to be on a team. Despite tak-
ing a lot of time out of his 
schedule with daily practice 
and weekend games that can 
sometimes take the team out 
of state, McDonald feels that 
it is all worth it to do what he 
loves. “There is nothing bet-
ter than going out on a Sat-
urday and winning with your 
teammates.”

On Thursday, ?rst-year 
Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis 
player Michael Rozenvasser 
competed in the quarter?nals 
of the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association (ITA) Oracle Cup 
in Arizona. Rozenvasser has 
had an impressive start to his 
rookie season, and he quali-
?ed for the national tourna-
ment by winning the ITA 
Southeast Regional tourna-
ment on Oct. 3.
For Rozenvasser’s quarter-
?nals match, he had to face off 
against the number one seed 
in the tournament, a senior 
from Skidmore College. This 
challenge didn’t deter Rozen-
vasser’s focus at all though, 
and he played a controlled, 
clean game to take down his 
opponent in two quick sets, 
6–2, 6–2. He earned himself a 
ticket to the national tourna-
ment semi?nal round.
The following day, Rozen-
vasser stepped onto the hot 
Arizona court for another in-
tense match. The young rook-
ie was matched up against 
another senior in this round, 
this time from Emory Univer-
sity. Rozenvasser started slow, 
making a few mistakes in the 
?rst set and eventually falling 
6–2. This didn’t keep Rozen-
vasser from pushing back, 
however. He gathered himself 
in between sets and came out 
strong in the second, jumping 
out to a quick 4–1 lead. The 
pressure must have started 
to mount on Rozenvasser, or 
perhaps it was fatigue, but 
he began to lose the lead that 
he had worked so hard to 
achieve in the ?rst half of the 
set. Rozenvasser tried his best 
to stay in the game but his 
experienced senior opponent 
would not let go of his grip 
on the game. Rozenvasser 
dropped the next ?ve games 
and lost the match with a ?nal 
score of 6–4 for the set.
That wasn’t the end of the 
tournament for Rozenvasser, 
however. He still had to play 
the third place match against 
last year’s fourth place win-
ner at the same tournament. 
Rozenvasser’s inexperience 
once again proved to be a key 
factor in the game as he was 
defeated 6–2, 6–3. Rozen-
vasser should be proud of his 
performance, though. He was 
the only Tartan player to be 
invited to this tournament, 
and competed as a ?rst-year 
against a ?eld of mostly se-
niors. Even though he didn’t 
make it past the semi?nals, 
Rozenvasser can look back at 
this tournament and know he 
improved as a player and com-
peted among the best at a na-
tional level. This was the last 
competition of the year for 
Rozenvasser and the Tartan 
men’s tennis team, but they’ll 
pick back up in February for 
more action on the court.

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
about reconciling politics and climate change
Dear Sarah,
This week I watched Interstellar for the second 
time, or rather, the first time not under the 
influence of potently delicious baked goods. So 
basically, I watched Interstellar for the first time 
this week.
It’s lingering like a cold sore on my mind. There 
are, of course, several reasons for this: I felt the 
emotional wreckage that Coop and Murph’s 
relationship left in my heart, I wondered why 
Coop would send the “stay” message again 
when he was there when it didn’t work, I still 
struggled to understand relativity, but most of all, 
I freaked the fuck out about the environment.
I don’t ever want to be alive for a time when 
Plan A is to abandon Earth and repopulate the 
great unknown. My survival instincts are pretty 
weak. Once the panic of our inevitable demise 
sets in, I’ll probably just die from the anxiety. My 
anxiety is already killing me just thinking about 
it. So, like, anyone else?
Not to mention, the honey bees, the carbon 
tipping point, Hurricane Matthew, AND the 
Great Barrier Reef. Our planet is literally on the 
verge of a massive natural crisis and some of 
the most powerful people on the planet still try 
to look the nation in the face and say there’s no 
problem. Haven’t these people seen Interstellar? 
Are they willingly leading us into a future without 
food or air? It’s not like we need those things, 
really.
Sarah, talk me down before I hop the next 
Megabus to D.C. and cause a scene. 
Super Creeped About Rapid Earth Decay
Dear SCARED,
I’m going to do the opposite of talking you 
down. I’m going to recommend some more 
movies. Go ahead and try The Day After 
Tomorrow, Into the Storm, Dante’s Peak, any 
Mad Max movie, On the Beach, The Road, and I 
could go on.
The film industry has embraced the theory that 
nature will one day kill us, which we kind of 
deserve for killing nature anyway. You might 
think, why should I watch all these movies when 
I’m already mad at humanity for destroying the 
planet?
It comes down to the psychological principle of 
habituation — if a stimulus is repeated enough 
it will begin to have less and less impact. Just 
inundate your senses with destruction and you’ll 
become numb to it! It won’t help the world, but 
it will help you not to be as sad about the failure 
of the human race.
But if you really want to do something, you don’t 
have to hop on a bus to the nation’s capital. 
Show up at the polls this November and vote 
for candidates that prioritize environmental and 
climate issues, or at least the candidates that 
don’t openly plan to screw us over, like Donald 
Trump and Pat Toomey. A vote for either of them 
is a vote for imminent death. Think about the 
honey bees, before it’s too late.
Go forth in righteous anger,
Sarah

vocal talent at Carnegie Mellon? oh yeah.
Carnegie Mellon University is one of the most 
prestigious schools in the country, and it houses 
the most quirky and fantastic, talented and 
straight-up glorious bunch of students I have 
met.  If there was ever a time that this was true, 
it was last Saturday night at AcaPittsburgh.
 The students that make up the various a 
cappella groups on campus are energetic and 
absolutely in love with what they do. Many put 
in over four hours a week of practice with their 
groups, as well as their own personal practice 
time outside the group, all while juggling other 
extracurriculars and all the craziness that is 
Carnegie Mellon coursework.  
This event was both mind blowing and 
beneficial to the community. Counterpoint, the 
first all-female a cappella group at Carnegie 
Mellon, worked in tandem with Sigma Alpha 
Iota to organize the event. 
All proceeds go to People to People, an 
organization that provides assistance 
and encouragement to music programs in 
developing countries all over the world. 
People to People fosters and supports the 
important role that music plays in creating 
interconnected communities, and truly 
supported the message of the night, that music 
is the universal language.  
I cannot even begin to express how much 
every single performance blew me away. The 
pieces that each group performed ranged 
from hauntingly beautiful to soul-rocking, and 
included everything from Kanye West to ABBA 
(personal favorite). 
Deewane and Saans incorporated their cultural 
background into their music by meshing Indian 
languages with modern pop songs, creating 
unique parallels between the different styles of 
music. 
Treblemakers made my heart tremble with the 
power of Halsey’s “Control.” C# Singers threw 
the audience into fits of giggles with their 
hilarious rendition of “Shia LeBeouf.”  
Soundbytes created a charged atmosphere 
with “Ultralight Beam,” and The Originals 
brought everyone nearly to tears with their 
heart-wrenching arrangement of “Stone Cold.”  
At the end of the night, Counterpoint wanted 
to redefine what it meant to “sing like a girl” 
and performed ABBA’s “Man After Midnight” 
which made the girl power levels in the room 
skyrocket.  
Altogether, the night was nearly two hours of 
amazing singers and vocal percussionists who, 
quite honestly, knocked my socks off.  Music 
that I had never even heard before managed 
to reach into my chest and grab me by the 
heartstrings.  
If you didn’t get a chance to witness all of the 
amazing talent at AcaPittsburgh, don’t worry.  
There are more a cappella concerts to come.

Strip Crawl
Student Senate organized event gives us a chance to explore the colorful Strip District.
Traffic along the strip district slowed to a crawl this past 
Saturday as Pittsburgh residents and Carnegie Mellon 
students came to enjoy the various vendors that crowd-
ed the streets. The Carnegie Mellon Student Senate 
organizes the Strip Crawl event on a yearly basis, in 
order to give Carnegie Mellon students a chance to 
explore the various cultures housed by the Strip District. 
Carnegie Mellon students received discounts from par-
ticipating vendors, which included delis like DeLuca’s, as 
well as sweet shops and some artisan wares. Highlights 
of this year’s Strip Crawl include:
Karen’s Kind Beads
This quirky little store is made up of entirely handmade 
items which range from earrings to necklaces to knitted 
scarves. Every piece was beautifully made with care. The 
founder of the shop began making the crafty wares five 
years ago, and hopes that people who buy them will 
wear them happily and in good health.
DeLuca’s Diner
As a self-proclaimed foodie, I couldn’t help myself 
from eating something throughout this food-laden 
event. DeLuca’s Diner is not to be missed on the list of 
affordable and amazing places to eat. They offer a wide 
variety of comfort foods, and they absolutely rock their 
breakfast menu. As you’re already in Pittsburgh, take the 
plunge and stuff yourself sometime soon.
Lilly’s Sweet Bakery
I had to have a buddy keep me from buying literally 
everything in this bakery. Every pastry and icing-covered 
item looked absolutely heavenly and tasted fantastic to 
boot. If you want the best sugar high you’ve ever had, 
definitely make a stop there.
Klavon’s Ice Cream
Stepping inside Klavon’s is like taking a giant time hop 
back to the world of the 1930s. With their revolving bar 
stools and stainless steel equipment, you’ll be shocked 
that there isn’t a Wurlitzer jukebox in the corner. On top 
of the aesthetic and atmosphere, they also offer a range 
of ice cream flavors, sundaes, and if you’re feeling a bit 
old fashioned, floats.
Bradley’s Book Outlet
This book shop is quaint and a gem for students who 
love to read and don’t want to be broke. Bradley’s sells 
discounted books of all kinds, as they have been for the 
past 20 years. They always have deals and coupons pop-
ping up, so if you’re a bookworm, drop by.
Allegheny Coffee & Tea Exchange
If you’re a coffee addict, then this is the place for you. 
Allegheny Coffee & Tea Exchange has been located in 
the Strip District for over fifty years! 
They offer gourmet teas and coffees, as well as regular 
blends if you’re not feeling quite as adventurous. On 
top of delicious coffee and tea, their atmosphere is 
cozy and comforting, and I found it very hard to leave 
once I stepped through the door.
Roxanne’s Dried Flowers
This gorgeous shop creates a variety of colorful and 
decorative items that are reasonably priced, and they 
make them all year round! If your dorm room starts get-
ting a tad gloomy this Pittsburgh winter, definitely visit 
Roxanne’s to give it a pop of color.
This does not even begin to cover the massive number 
of amazing places the Strip District has to offer. It is 
a beautiful and culturally dense part of Pittsburgh. If 
you’re new to the city, or even if you just haven’t been 
there in a little while, spend a day in the Strip District 
and see what the city really has to show you. And of 
course, eat ALL of the food. It’s fantastic.

Maker Faire
Matthew McGehee | Junior Staffwriter
Inventors, scientists, crafters and creators of all 
shapes and sizes gathered at the Pittsburgh leg 
of Maker Faire this Saturday. The Faire, which has 
now become an international phenomenon, first 
launched in 2006 and has become a hub for curi-
ous minds. 
This weekend, attendees had the opportunity to 
engage in a variety of workshops, presentations 
and intriguing banter with some of the best and 
brightest minds out there.
Exhibits included battling robots, flaming guitars, 
and animatronic faces, amongst others.A test drive of one of the go-carts that was being prepared for the 
big race later in the day. Watching it speed by was exhilarating.
Robots, controlled by engineers on their laptops, were playing a ball game rem-
iniscent of soccer. They were ramming into each other, pushing the ball around, 
and occasionally even picking it up off the ground.

Denzel Curry
Florida based rapper blows the roof off CC Studio Theater
I’ve never loved rap music. Hip Hop and Rap 
was never really my thing in high school. But 
when Carol City, Florida-based rapper Denzel 
Curry brought the house down at the Cohon 
Center’s Studio Theater Saturday, Oct. 15 to a 
sweaty, capped room of 200 students, I com-
pletely changed my mind. Throughout the night, 
Denzel Curry brought the crowd on a wave of 
non-stop energy, lighting up the crowd with his 
verses, freestyles, and dominating presence. The 
Activities Board’s second concert of the year 
did not disappoint, from the opening act’s first 
note to Denzel Curry’s final verse. 
MORGANTICS opened the concert playing and 
remixing tracks from current hip hop legends, 
while also playing his own original songs. He 
succeeded in setting up this really chill vibe and 
building anticipation for whatever Denzel Curry 
was about to bring later in the evening, while 
also lighting up the crowd with his heavy beats 
that reverberated through the speakers into the 
audience. 
Those things are really powerful. I felt the bass 
drop within every bone of my body. If you 
ever find yourself at another EDM concert, I 
recommend standing next to large 20 feet speakers 
the entire night if you want to be a little deaf the 
next morning. As soon as MORGANTICS finished, 
Denzel Curry made his presence known immediate-
ly as he came on stage.
Putting his U up (I still don’t know what it stands 
for), and directing others to do the same, he com-
manded the crowd with this new yet familiar energy 
that made the place feel like a crazy Stage AE 
concert while still maintaining a distinct Carnegie 
Mellon vibe that felt comforting, invigorating, and 
dangerously thrill-seeking.
“Crazy,” “dangerous,” and “thrill-seeking” are a 
few choice words I’d use to describe the night. My 
friends and I, in the front, were on the unexpected 
receiving end of a lot of sweat, spit, and water that 
didn’t come from a flipped bottle. 
I had Playfair flashbacks, mingling with the crowd 
while we were crushed against the metal fence sep-
arating Denzel Curry from the audience, and I was 
second guessing its sustainability against 200 uber-
hyped Carnegie Mellon students. 
The poor girl next to me was clearly not used to the 
situation at hand and looked a little uncomfortable. 
But I wouldn’t have traded my experience for any-
thing else that night. The energy of the crowd was 
infectious and only made everyone more excited. 
Denzel Curry pumped up the crowd and made 
sure they didn’t get too rowdy, skirting the line 
between maintaining that balance while getting 
hyped himself. He also interacted with the crowd 
a lot, which I loved. He gave out a lot of sweaty 
high fives, got up in the faces of the crowd when 
he rapped, and it seemed like he wasn’t afraid to 
just be himself and have a great time with himself, 
his DJ, and his audience. He’d let loose on the 
stage with his dance moves, and when he’d mess 
up the verse he wasn’t ashamed to start over, 
giving us another show and somehow making him 
smile harder.
After a lot of deliberation, before his performance 
of his viral hit “Ultimate,” Denzel Curry even 
brought a guy on stage who wanted to crowd 
surf, as if the night wasn’t already crazy enough. 
A few people narrowly missed a shoe to the chin, 
and he was almost like a representation of what 
the night was like: a build-up of crazy, fun hype 
that refused to go down or take no for an answer. 
And Denzel Curry never failed to keep up that 
hype throughout the entire night from the first 
verse of the first song of the setlist “Zone 3” to 
the last beats of some new songs off his re-release 
of his second album Imperial, making for another 
great Activities Board concert and an even greater 
performance.

Every Oct. 11 is recognized as National 
Coming Out Day, originally founded in 1988 
to commemorate the March on Washington for 
Lesbian and Gay Rights. The day promotes a 
safe world in which the LGBTQ+ community can 
thrive with acceptance and love. In high school, 
we remembered the people who marched by 
having students of all class levels give speeches 
about their coming out stories, showing other kids 
that it was okay to be who you were. Holding 
with that, I wanted to share my own story. 
When I was little, I had one singular idea of 
romance. Princesses got their princes, and lived 
happily ever after. I never even considered 
that there were other possibilities out there. I 
remember the day that worldview changed, 
almost like an electric shock to my brain. During 
a sleepover in middle school, while talking about 
our crushes, someone whispered, “Boys are 
gross. I like girls.”  We fell silent. How were we 
supposed to react? 
The subject was dropped.
But then there was high school, where I learned 
words like gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and 
transgender. I learned that just because Sydney 
was on my girl’s ield hockey team in 8th grade 
didn’t mean that when puberty hit she wouldn’t 
realize that Elliot was a better name, and male 
pronouns were what he wanted.
And that was okay. I loved meeting all of these 
awesome people who knew EXACTLY who they 
were. Only, I had never had an AHA moment. 
For me, it was a slow realization. Maybe I 
wasn’t as clear cut as I had originally thought. I 
had no idea where to put myself. I wanted to it 
into a box. Any box, really. I felt like I needed 
a category so that I could it in, so that I would 
make sense. So I could feel validated. But I didn’t 
it into any of them. I liked girls, I liked guys. I 
liked trans girls and guys. I liked people with 
kickass personalities.
What I hadn’t learned was that I could be all of 
those things at once.
It took me a long time to get to the point where 
I can comfortably call myself pansexual. I went 
through several categories before it. And every 
time I changed what I called myself, people 
would ask me things like, “Wait, aren’t you 
gay?” or, “I thought you were bi?”
A lot of people don’t realize that it’s a long road. 
A long and confusing one. And that’s ok, maybe 
they’re perfectly happy with the category they’ve 
been given and never had to ask themselves 
these questions. Maybe they igured it out after 
only one category change. It took me longer 
than most. But I’m happy with my category now. 
In fact, it’s the most anti-categoric category out 
there. It’s me telling the world, “I’LL LIKE WHO I 
LIKE AND THAT’S IT!”
And that’s it.

Their performance engaged viewers,
