VOL. HI, No. 15Cartan
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1909TEN CENTS
“COOLED DOWN”
CO oBmHUF 3, CWL$0BWkR,
Well! Well!! Well!!! It certainly did happen, 
and to quote a line from “Patsy,” or the “Hoosier 
School Boy,” “who'd 'ave thunk it? Yes, sir, cooled 
me down was what they did and they did to the 
Queen’s taste.” In other words, “Boulfrois,” Presi­
dent of the First Year Industrials, was given a most 
effectual ducking, in the miniature bath tub in the 
corner of the foundry.
No room for argument, on last Wednesday after­
noon, January Gth, 1909, at precisely 12.45 o’clock, 
the High and Mighty Second Year Industrials, head­
ed by none other than the astute Mr. Young, neatly 
performed the above related ceremony. Giving credit 
where credit is due they certainly made a beautiful 
job of it.
This is how and why it all came about.
You see it has been announced that Dr. Pritchett, 
former head of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech­
nology, was to give the members of the trade schools 
a short talk in Assembly Hall at 12 o’clock noon. 
The room was crowded with Industrials from both 
the upper and lower classes, and in accordance 
with the personal request of our Dean Connelly, 
“Boulfrois” was to act as cheer leader. After first 
being introduced by Director Hamerschlag; Dr. Prit­
chett gave a short heart to heart talk. I can safely 
say we all deeply appreciated it and the customary 
applause was given with a will.
Now comes the why of it.. “Boulfrois” got up and 
called for three times three or nine raws and a Dr. 
Pritchett. It may have been through faulty enun­
ciation on the part of the cheer leader, but I’ll leave 
it to any instructor present at the meeting, those 
cheers, to say the least, were very, very weak. This 
brought forth a short reproof from the cheer leader, 
and was followed up by a request for the “Short
Speller” with a Dr. Pritchett on the end. And with­
out a doubt, in direct opposition to the first, those 
cheers were long and lusty.
Then came the scramble for the commons. After 
luncheon I was up in Athletic Association, Treasurer 
Mr. Leed’s office, trying to get a little basket-ball 
news in shape for the newspapers; when our clever 
friend, Mr. Young, with the assistance of an able con­
federate informed me that “he would a word with 
me,” in the lower corridor. I dropped the whole 
school basket-ball news when only half completed, 
and hastened to obey the request of an upper class­
man. A few seconds brought me into the middle of 
the enemy’s cam]). It was too late to beat a retreat; 
as much as I blushed, and mildly protested against 
the honored attentions of the upper classmen, I was 
slowly and with painstaking care cooled down to 32 
degrees Fahrenheit.
Words failed me at the time, and had not Mr. 
Dosey, who arrived just in time to be too late for the 
ceremony, came to the front, with the reply, that I 
was the most thorough and incidentally the dampest 
picture he had ever had the good fortune to gaze 
upon, I fear I should have appeared most ungrateful 
by my silence.
I was in the midst of hearty congratulations from 
all sides and was inwardly patting myself on the 
back, when one of the several First Year Industrials, 
who had had the courage to peep in through a crack 
in the door, chanced to drop a most unbidden re­
mark. I did not catch the first part of it, but it 
ended with something like “Laughs best.”
Of course there had to be something to spoil an 
otherwise pleasant afternoon. Sir, I can’t tell you 
exactly to what he referred, but I’m almost positive 
he intimated the future.

When woman acquires a new art or science, she 
at once applies it to her own immediate needs. For 
instance, the editor visited the china-painting ex­
hibit at the Carnegie Institute receently. Some of 
the articles were of very mysterious shape and he 
was unable to comprehend their utility. A small ob­
ject, in appearance like a salt-shaker with an ex­
tension base, was especially puzzling. Upon inquiry 
of his fair companion, she answered, “Why, that's a 
hat-pin holder.” The editor was struck by the fact 
that among the articles decorated there was not a 
single shaving mug or spittoon (which is English for 
cuspidor.)
Similarly, it seems, the fair co-eds of the M. M.
C. S. have at once applied the principles of algebra 
to that, to a woman, most absorbing topic, marriage, 
and a very fair mess they have made of it, too. The 
concise, intelligent way in.which the subject is han­
dled. indicates that they are also proficient in (or 
rather as familiar with) the vicissitudes of matri­
mony as in the principles of mathematics.
The editor would only suggest that in his humble 
opinion, X equals the continued product of H, E, and 
L2.
Last Wednesday evening, Mr. Joseph McCreery 
invited a number of the boys to a box party at the 
Princess Theater. This may not sound familiar to 
any one not acquainted in Homestead, but the editor 
has been assured that it is the playhouse par ex­
cellence of that beautiful town. Among those pres­
ent were Messrs. Gilliard, Jackson, Galley, McCreery, 
Morgan, and Keagy. By the combined efforts of 
Messrs. Jackson, Galley, McCreery, Morgan and 
Keagy, Mr. Samuel Gilliard was induced to behave 
himself, and so it happened that they were allowed 
to stay until the show was over. It is said they bade 
each other “good morning” when they parted.
Wonder if that suggestion about the “Auxiliary 
Foot-Ball Squad" is based on certain incidents which 
occurred in Room 104 early in the season.
Prof. Willett was earnestly endeavoring to de­
scribe the wretched condition of the laboring class 
of England in the early nineteenth century. During 
his discourse he stated that “their only pleasure was 
drinking gin from Saturday night till Monday morn­
ing. You can imagine what would go with this”— 
interrupted by Ricketts, beacon light of section A, 
“What was it, professor, water?”
Contributed by “A Friend:”
There was a girl in our town,
And she was very sweet.
She felt her hair was coming down 
While traversing the street.
And when she knew her hair was down,
With all her might and main,
She twisted it into a knot,
And put it up again.
— (Sounds like McKeesport.)
Recently Mr. Jay Rothschild Newman, E. M. (emi­
nent mathematician), was with several companions, 
engaged in the act of leaving a street or trolley car, 
when he was accosted by a lady seated next the 
door in this wise: “Young man, can you tell me what 
is the attraction over there?” whereupon the E. M. 
answered, in a tone of utter conviction, “Nay, nay, 1 
have never been able to find out," and concluded the 
aforesaid act. Jay says it was an elderly lady; for 
his sake, let us hope so.
The Hon. Wm. Bailey McCreery is a keen observer 
of “men and things,” and happy to relate also of 
“women and things.” This is proved by the follow­
ing little incident he claims to have observed at the 
Albin. It is given as he stated it:
“The play was not at all interesting, and a man in 
front of me seemed very much drilled—I mean bored. 
Suddenly he leaped to his feet.”
“ ‘I heard an alarm of fire,’ he said. ‘I must go 
and see where it is.’ ”
"His wife, whose hearing was less acute, made 
way for him in silence, and he disappeared."
“It wasn’t a fire after all," he said, on his return. 
“Nor water either,” said his wife, with a sniff.

At a recent meeting of the members of the Band 
and Orchestra, an organization was effected whereby 
the two joined under one management and the fol­
lowing officers were elected:
President—J. R. Decker.
Secretary-Treasurer—H. W. Godfrey.
Manager—S. L. Potts.
Assistant Managers—H. A. Gump, R. M. P. Kenton.
A contract has been tendered Mr. G. Steffen, of the 
Pittsburg Orchestra, to conduct our Band and Or­
chestra, but as yet nothing definite has been settled.

It seems that the Applied Design will have a star

dates have signed their names to the list. Manager 
Lamont is now making preparations for the opening 
game.

2*p So1p t3a S2tme,
I.
On New Year's day 
I always say 
I'll make a new resolve 
For all this year 
Yes, sir, right here!
My whole life I’ll revolve.
II.
Upon first thought 
There is that draught 
Which satisfies my thirst;
I’ll give it up 
I will not sup 
Not if my head should burst.
HI.
I'll save my mon 
It will be fun 
To watch a fortune grow;
I’ll give up cards 
I'll quit my pards 
It won't be hard, I know.
IV.
I will not smoke 
It is no joke 
I really mean to quit;
I will not chew 
I’m telling you 
No filthy juice I’ll spit.
V.
I will not swear
I do not care 
How angry I become;
The evil one 
Will have some fun 
To get me cursing some.
VI.
To church I’ll go
I won’t be slow 
I’ll be a whole new man;
I’ll quit the club 
And that’s the rub—
I’ll do the best I can.
VII.
But pretty soon
I change the tune 
That role was deep for me;
For in my haste
I took a “taste”
One pledge is broke you see.
VIII.
The start was made 
At cards I played 
And swore at what I lost;
I use the weed
I think indeed 
The old way’s worth its cost. J. G. G.

David Warfield recalls an old story of a soulful 
young girl, sitting one morning at her piano, prac­
ticing and dreaming. Glancing thro’ the window, she 
saw, coming slowly down the street, the old town 
music master, and she thought of all the beauty of 
knowing music as he knew it, and was entranced to 
note that, as he reached her window and her playing 
became audible to him, he paused, and listened. She 
played on eagerly, charmed that he should care to 
hear until her musings were interrupteed by his 
hammering on the window with his stick and shout­
ing, “Sharp your F!”
Old Sandy McGregor sat one day in the village 
tavern, relating stories of his early life. “Ma coos- 
in’s man died aboot that time,” he rambled, “so I 
knockit off wark twa 'oors early and went to the 
house. The corpse's wife, a coosin o’ mine, opened 
the door, and 1 went in an’ sat a while, and she said, 
“Wull ye have some soda water? An’ I wad, and we 
sat awahile, an’ she said, “The funera’s Tuesday.” 
So on Tuesday I knockit aff wark twa ’oors early, 
an’ put on ma blacks, and went o’er to see them a’. 
The corpse’s wife was a coosin o’rnine. So I went 
in, and there sat ten, twenty people, an there was 
-)me soda water on a table, and bymeby someone 
said, “Wull someone sing a song?” Holy Willie 
saed he knew a comic sang, but the corpse’s wife, 
a coosin o’ mine, said ‘He never did like comic sangs,’ 
and Willie was quate. Presently the Meenister said, 
“Had na we better be going?” An so we took the 
corpse, and the Meenister went first and then came 
the iolk wee the corpse, and then the ither foulk, 
an’ I came behint wi’ the soda water. The day was 
perishin’ hot, an’ the Meenister walked slow, so 
whiles we stopped an’ rested, an’ had some soda 
water, and then went on. An’ it got hotter an’ hot­
ter, an’ the way was lang forbye, an’ whiles we come 
to a hedge, an cool shade. So we put the corpse 
ahint the hedge out of the heat, and all set doon an’ 
had some soda water, an’ then we een went on to the 
Ciemetery. An’ as we came toilin up the hill, the 
Saxton cam oot, and he said, says he, “Who are ee?” 
an’ we said “We’re a funera’,” and says he, “But 
whaur be the corpse?” an’ sure enough we had left 
it ahint the hedge. Ah—those days (*) those days!
Then there’s that man Glass. He lives in Oak- 
mont, and goes rolling home at two o’clock in the 
morning. It takes ambition, gentlemen. He is right 
fond of horses, is Glass. Told one on Raymond, of 
the Tartan Staff, the other night. Mr. Cope said, 
“Raymond, is x+y equal to 2z?” and Raymond said 
“Yes, ma’am.” He has been well brought up. No 
danger oi the Tartan going yellow while he’s with it.
Our friend Bell rang in a story the other night. 
He's always about half asleep until there is foot-ball 
to bfe played, and then he makes a steam turbine 
look like a sewing machine. Here is the story: A 
gentleman went into a store to buy a shirt-waist for 
his wife. The sales girl mounted a ladder to the tob 
box and demurely inquired, "What bust?” “I heard 
nothing,” said the chap, absently. Bell has a 
prurient mind.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Director brought Dr. 
Pritchett over to visit our school and at 3 o’clock 
he spoke to us for a few minutes. He said:
Since I have been connected with the Carnegie 
Commission I have visited many hundreds of col­
leges in this country. I consider this college of 
yours a rather unusual one. The choice of a college 
is of great importance, of almost as much importance 
as the choosing of one’s parents. There is a large 
number of professed colleges in the United States, 
but you can't always tell by the name whether it is 
a college or not. That reminds me of the time when
I was in Mexico and tried to secure a native to 
guide me up Popocatepetal. He could not under­
stand my reasons for wishing to ascend the mountain 
so finally, in answer to his question, I answered 
‘‘When I go back to the States, I want to be able to 
say that I have been up Popocatepetal.” The native 
looked at me in a perfectly naive way and said, 
“Can’t you say that anyway?” Some of these so- 
called colleges are just like that native. Now. edu­
cational honesty is just as important as individual 
honesty. A school should make clear what it is, what 
its purpose is.
This school of yours has an unusually big and defi­
nite aim. To turn out capable, efficient, useful wo­
men—surely that is a big thing. A great deal of the 
successs attained by any individual depends also on 
making clear to oneself why he undertakes a certain 
course. One is more likely to get to the end of a 
journey over a road which he has picked out. I 
would like to suggest that you find out as quickly as 
possible what your purpose is and then stick to it 
steadfastly to the end.
My experience as president of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology taught me that students are 
usually divided into three classes, as the Chinaman 
divided foreigners. My friend and I once set out on a 
four weeks’ voyage, and having no friends to bid fare­
well, answered ourselves by walking up and down 
the deck and watching the preparations for depart­
ure. We soon noticed a Chinese coolie looking at us 
intently and we returned his gaze. Finally he could 
stand it no longer and inquired in pigeon English 
(which by the wray is Chinese business English) — 
“Come buy cargo?” When we explained that we did 
not come on business, his curiosity increased. After 
staring at us for another minute, he asked, “Spect 
die soon?”
“No, we did not come for our health.”
If we were neither business men, nor health seek­
ers, there was but one thing else we could be. With 
a contemptuous little grunt—“Humph! you just come 
look see”—he turned away.
That is the way with students. Some come to 
college on business—to ‘buy cargo’; some ‘spect die 
soon’—come because it is the thing to do; others

just come to ‘look see’, to have a good time. I hope 
that none of you have come here merely to ‘look see’. 
My closing advice to you is to find out to which one 
of these classes you belong. It is perhaps wise to 
belong to all three, if one can keep the pcoper bal­
ance. Come first of all to ‘buy cargo’, and because 
it is a good thing to do, but get all the fun out of it 
that is compatible with good, earnest work.” (Ap­
plause.)
Following Dr. Pritchett’s talk, Director Hamer- 
schlag spoke very briefly, but pointedly, and it will 
be well for us to remember and think over his words. 
He said first of all that the record of the past term 
had amazed him—that there had been very good 
work done, and there were very few students condi­
tioned. “Most of those conditioned have failed be­
cause of absence from class work, and the absences 
have been chiefly because of sickness. A new rule 
will go into effect this term, and all excuses because 
of sickness must be verified by the school physician. 
Sickness is, of course, the very best possible excuse 
for absence, but a trivial headache should not be 
made a pretext for cutting classes. It is not fair to 
the others for certain girls to be excused all the time, 
and those girls cannot expect to do good work unless 
they attend regularly.
"The evidence of a good holiday is good earnest 
work. The winter term is in many respects the 
most satisfactory and gives the best opportunity for 
good work. I hope you will make it count. If the

---------------------------------------------------

THETA RTAN7
students are in earnest about their work it is much 
easier for the teachers. .As you know, your faculty 
is not in the best of health. Sickness has laid Miss 
Purmort low, and others of your instructors are not 
in the best physical condition. You can do much to 
help lighten the teachers’ burdens, and I ask as a 
special favor that you do your best to relieve the 
teachers of the hard task of drilling.”
This last thought of the Director’s is something 
we need to consider. Students are very likely to 
go to school as one goes to a grocery store, with a 
basket for the grocer to fill. They think when they 
have |WmA to the school, they have done their part. 
Then they assume a perfectly passive attitude and 
expect the instructor to fill their heads with knowl­
edge. But knowledge does not come that way. A 
teacher may teach till he's ‘blue in the face’, but 
unless the pupil puts forth some effort himself that 
teaching is wasted. The student must do the $AHBU­
kUG for himself. Our* teachers can only put before 
us certain facts—we must take these and digest them, 
make them our own, if they are ever to be of any 
use to us. Our Faculty works hard for us,—harder 
than most of us realize, and we ought, out of com­
mon courtesy, for their sakes if not for our own, to 
do our best to make their labor fruitful. At the be­
ginning of the New Year and of the new term let 
us all think seriously about this.
On Wednesday, Mrs. Hamerschlag and her guest, 
Mrs. Pritchett, took lunch in the House with Miss 
Smith and Miss West.
We are all glad to learn that Miss Purmort has 
improved so rapidly as to be able to leave the hos­
pital this week. She will go to her grandmother’s 
in Ohio for the rest of this term to gain strength 
and health for the next term’s work. We shall be 
glad to have her with us again.

Here is the motto Miss Smith has given us for the 
New Year. It is a good one to “remember her by”:
“If any little word of mine 
May make a life the brighter,
If any little song of mine 
May make a heart the lighter,
God help me speak that little word 
And take my little singing,
And drop it in some lonely vale 
To set the echoes ringing.”
Judging by the number of engagements announced 
recently, the little blind god got in some pretty good 
work in Leap Year!

We wish that all of the students (and the faculty, 
too, for that matter), could have heard the speech 
made at the banquet of the Class of 1911 by Donald
D. Naismith. It is to be regretted that no copy of it 
was made or taken—if one had been, we would print 
all that related to the Schools at large, omitting only 
the portion devoted to some private affairs of the 
Class.
After having stamped out most of the spaks, and 
let the smoke roll away, the causes that provoked the 
whirlwind of comment may be examined to a better 
advantage. The matter of student government was 
taken up, and the general trend of the remarks 
were calculated to wake anyone up to the fact that 
there is a greater field to be covered than has been 
popularly imagined. Before much can be said on 
the subject, either one way or the other, the entire 
situation must be clearly understood.
From the speech made before the day student body 
by Dr. Pritchett last week, we can take a number 
of things to support us when we say, “that the con­
ditions existing here in Carnegie Technical Schools 
are not so different from the conditions to be found 
in any of the other educational institutions in the 
country” as some persons we could name seem to 
think. The good and learned Doctor made it perfect­
ly clear that the student bodies of all colleges and 
technical schools are very much alike. We venture 
to add, that since our courses are second to none, the 
other conditions to be met with are exactly the same 
as those of other American schools and colleges. 
WThile it must be distinctly understood that, in a great 
many respects, the Schools are unique inasmuch as 
they combine under one general head so many differ­
ent branches in entirely different kinds of work; nev­
ertheless, as we have endeavored to point out, the 
same problems of student activities and student 
government exist here just as they exist anywhere 
else. Tech is young and growing at a tremenduous
rate; therefore Tech must be careful. A careful 
study of how they do it at the older seats of learning, 
reveals the fact that by far the larger proportion of 
them have Student Senates, run by the students un­
der their own constitutions, for the purpose of regu­
lating and advising on the problems of discipline 
and general conduct of the student body.
Since they have been in such successful operation 
for a long time, the idea is beyond the experimental 
stage. They work out in practice, and fill a need 
that sooner or later makes itself felt where so many 
are all striving for the same goal. We can see no 
unsurmountable difficulties in the way of the adoption 
of the plan. It might be best to have one for the 
Schools of Applied Science and Design, one for the 
A. and J., and one for the M. M. C. S. than to have 
one do the work for all four schools. Let us hope 
our present attitude toward the project will at least 
rouse enough interest to bring the matter up for 
discussion. Once that is started, the advantages 
and uses of a Senate cannot help but commend its 
adoption. *
What has become of the various committees and 
representatives composing the Athletic Constitution 
Board? When you come to think of it, considerable 
time has elapsed since they were last heard of. Judg­
ing from some of the happenings in regard to the re­
cent curtailings of the schedules of some of the 
teams, we could use an Athletic constitution if one 
happened our way. It is all right to take all the time 
necessary to make the document a good one, but don’t 
any one loaf on the job.
Amid the excitement attending the moving into 
the new building, we must not allow ourselves to for­
get the ATHLETIC LOAN FUND. It is time for a 
systematic effort to reach every man in the Schools 
to be begun. There is no time to sit around and 
think about it. Spring will be here the first thing 
we know, and what progress has been made since 
the Christmas vacation? Pay in the loans as fast 
as possible and KEEP THE STEAM SHOVEL GO­
ING. It is this fund that is doing it, and the work 
cannot stop now.
How about that vaudeville show for the benefit of 
the Athletic Fund? Just another pipe dream.
KEEP THE STEAM SHOVEL GOING!

On Wednesday, January 6th, the Plebe Class elect­
ed the following officers to serve for the winter 
term:
President—Cogswell.
Vice-president—Holiday.
Secretary—Lamoree.
Treasurer—Knapp.
Tartan Representative—Gamble.
Peloubet and Hoskin have left for regions un­
known. Peloubet had the courage to visit the schools 
on the 5th to bid us all good-bye. Of Hoskin, how­
ever, we cannot speak so laudably, for, although he 
was in Pittsburg on the same day, he did not come 
around for a last, fond, farewell.
Stone is the unhappy recipient of a New Year’s 
gift from Miss Fortune—one large size tooth-ache.
The Plebes are forced to do some shopping; over­
alls and jumpers this time.
The quietness and serenity of the lunch hour was 
disturbed last Thursday by the sound of falling glass 
in the hall. Instantly there was a hurrying of stu­
dents in that direction and the voices of the amazed 
and terrified ones, mingled with the shuffling of 
feet, added to the general confusion which resulted. 
“But how did it happen?” was the question on every 
one’s lips. A very remarkable case, indeed; there 
was the broken pane of glass and there was a Plebe 
with a guilty smile on his face. No, he hadn’t touched
it, bumped it, struck it, kicked it, or thrown any­
thing through it. How then did it happen? Ah! 
that is a terrible secret.
When Prof. Gibbs carefully drew several good- 
sized cobbles from his coat pocket previous to his 
lecture; we thought that he was prepared to throw 
stones at those who go to sleep, and we were greatly 
relieved to learn that this was not his intention, for 
the cobbles were nothing more than hatchet and 
hammer heads of a prehistoric people. And, no 
doubt, they were effectively used to put many a short­
tailed iSimeon to sleep when he dared to leave his 
verdant bower.
H. H. Brown has joined the Architects.
The Plebes of Applied Design have been on in­
specting tours during the past week through the new 
Applied Science building. As they don’t have classes 
in that place, it’s necessary to visit in this manner 
in order to see everything that is new.
Spregelburg was heard to make an offer for an 
amber-edged T square. In the most reckless and 
extravagant manner he said, “I will gif you twenty 
seex cents for it.”
It just came to light today that Mr. Withers, of the 
Applied Design, who played on the Plebe foot-ball 
team this year, is better known as “Pete” by his 
' friends in Swissvale, where he resides. When you 
see him don’t forget to address him in that manner.

The first banquet of the first Sophomore class was 
given at the Union Club last Friday evening. The 
committee appointed to arrange the banquet deserves 
credit for the manner in which the class was enter­
tained during the evening. Owing to the fact that 
important business detained him, Mr. Hornbostel 
was unable to speak. However, he sent his regrets 
and wished the class an enjoyable evening. Mr. 
Leete’s address was thoroughly enjoyed by all. He 
did not remain long with us after his address, but 
left with the words “Have a good time.” Everyone 
took his advice and loudly cheered the following 
speakers. The members of the class who spoke 
were L. W. Nicols, D. M. Naismith, E. R. Boots, Jr., 
R. B. Coldren and Alan Bright.
Nick’s speech was confined to class spirit, while 
Irish Naismith spoke about various kinds of “Fire­
works;” Boots, Coldren and Bright spoke along the 
lines of athletics and each gave an interesting talk.
After singing “America” and marching the “lock­
step” around the banquet hall, we all took a look at 
the city from the veranda around the twentieth floor 
of the building. The banquet was then declareed 
over and we all departed for home, feeling that the 
banquet had been a success and that.the spirit of 
good fellowship had been given a boost in the class.

During the month of December, the annual meet­
ing for the award of academic distinctions was held 
at Harvard. The following, which comprises nearly 
the whole of President Hadley’s speech on “The Obli­
gations of the Prize Winner,” first appeared. in the 
Harvard Bulletin of December 16th, 1908. A careful 
reading of the speech will reveal so many interesting 
and practical comments on the subject itself and 
kindred topics, that the insertion of such a large 
amount of it is felt to be justified.
President Hadley’s address was as follows:
“In the legend of the Round Table we read of one 
seat, occupying the place of honor, which was named 
the Siege Perilous. Other seats the knights held 
by what they had already done. As each had proved 
himself worthy, his name appeared above it in letters 
of gold. He had found his place, and he knew it. 
The seat of highest honor bore no name. No man 
knew whether he had a right to occupy until after 
the attempt. If the wrong man assumed it he van­
ished from the earth. If the right man assumed it, 
his name would then shine out as the leader of them 
all. He held the seat, not for the sake of what he 
had done, but for the sake of what he was yet to do.
“I welcome you, gentlemen, to the Siege Perilous 
at the round table of learning.
“Every prize of life has in it this element of peril. 
The competition which precedes the award is but a 
preliminary. The real test comes afterward. The 
man who takes the prize takes the chance of being 
a leader of men or of vanishing from the earth. 
The same presidential office in which Abraham Lin­
coln brought his people through their national crisis 
and found his own way to the martyr’s crown was 
the means of consigning his immediate predecessors 
to something little better than oblivion—to a judg­
ment from posterity which they would never have 
merited nor have received unless they had essayed 
to sit in the Siege Perilous.
“To put the matter in plain English, a prize is 
essentially an opportunity; the worth of the prize 
is in what we make of it afterward.
“Of course this is not the common view of the 
matter. We are too apt to regard all the prizes of 
life as ultimate goals, rather than the means to 
something higher. The man who is toiling hard to 
get two or three dollars a day regards wealth as 
the end of human ambition. The millionaire is, to 
his mind, the man who has assured himself and his 
family of comforts which the"goor man cannot con­
trol and who need wish no more. The man who is 
working for long hours as a draftsman or a clerk 
makes it the object of his ambition to be where he 
can give orders rather than receive them. Inde­
pendence of authority is the goal which he seeks, 
the thing which he regards as the prize of his pro­
fession, and with which he himself would be wholly 
content. In politics, the man who is working hard 
for office believes that his work will be done when he 
secures the highest office within his reach. This is 
the prize which he sets before his eyes. Beyond it 
he seeks nothing.
“But this is not the spirit which animates the prize 
winner, if he has in him the qualities of real leader­
ship—the qualities which have made it worth while 
for society to institute competitions and offer prizes. 
To the man of industrial genius wealth is not a goal; 
it is an instrument of selection. To the man with 
large professional ambition independence of authority 
is not a goal; it is a means of marking out new and 
better lines of professional knowledge and profes­
sional ethics. To the man who goes into politics in 
the spirit demanded by our Constitution office is not 
an end, but a means. He wishes to be governor, or

senator, or president, because as governor or senator 
or president be has the. chance to direct the destinies 
of his fellow men. If a man’s ideals of his business 
or his profession or his political career are lower 
than this the day when he wins the prize marks the 
beginning of his eclipse.
“And so it is with you also who are gathered here 
tonight. Your parents and your relatives, your teach­
ers and your friends, look upon this evening as a time 
of consummation of their hopes. You have competed 
honorably in things worth doing; you have done them 
so well that your name is inscribed in an honored 
list of prize winners. You may well feel proud to 
have your names added to that list. You may well 
feel satisfaction in the joy which you have given 
your friends. But for yourselves, if you in any 
way deserve the prizes, your dominant feeling should 
be anything rather than self-satisfaction. You have 
earned the right to be put on trial before the public 
eye—a good thing if you can stand the trial; a bad 
thing if you cannot. Twenty years hence you will 
either be the man whose John Harvard scholarship 
was the beginning of a distinguished career of ser­
vice to the world, or else the man who took the John 
Harvard scholarship and never did anything after­
ward. Be assured that the last will be the verdict, 
unless what you do hereafter is worthy of John Har­
vard. You have placed it out of your power to con­
tent the world with any ordinary intellectual achieve­
ment. The haven of respectable mediocrity is for­
ever closed to you. Your intellectual career must 
be either a distinct success or a distinct failure. The 
man who feels the responsibility of this hour is pre­
paring to make it a success. The man who allows 
himself to dwell on the satisfactions of the hour, 
except so far as they affect his parents and friends, 
is almost certainly doomed to failure.
“For the achievement which goes before the prize 
winning in college is even smaller in proportion to 
the work which is expected of a man afterward, than 
is the case with the prize competitions of our indus­
trial or political life. A man who has earned a hun­
dred thousand dollars in industry has in all ordinary 
cases done a good deal of industrial work and attain­
ed a good deal of business efficiency. The hundred 
thousand dollars may fairly be treated as a reward— 
an exorbitant reward, perhaps; at least so the social­
ists would say; but at any rate a compensation for 
work rendered. The man who attains high office 
must in ordinary cases have rendered a good deal 
of service both to his party and to the public. It 
may have been the wrong kind of service—at least, 
so our friends the independent newspaper editors 
generally think; but it represents real work, for which 
the office may be treated as in some sense a commen­
surate return. Now, to tell the plain truth, very few 
of you have earned the prizes which you have won in 
the same sense that the business man has earned 
his hundred thousand dollars or the politician has 
earned his membership in Congress. You have not, 
most of you advanced the boundaries of human 
knowledge. You have not, most of you, done any

work which has rendered direct service to anybody 
except yourselves. It will be a rare chance if there 
are two men in this room whose prizes represent 
original contributions of any considerable value. 
It will be a rare chance if there are half a dozen who 
have rendered any service commensurate with the 
amount of the prize.
“I do not know whether there is any real need of 
saying all this. If the audience were composed of 
prize winners solely, I am quite certain that it 
would be unnecessary. It is the advantaae of an an­
cient institution like Harvard, with its high intellect­
ual and ethical standards and its varied traditions of 
service, that it tends to discourage any callow over­
estimate of the work of an individual student. Our 
best American universities try to encourage intellect­
ual promise wherever they find it; but they do not 
encourage the student to treat promise as equivalent 
to performance. You know that your work is before 
you, not behind you. You know that the real prize 
which you have received is the opportunity for fur­
ther work and distinction. You know that the honor 
is going to be what a man makes of it, as far as each 
individual is concerned.
“What I want specially to emphasize is another 
and slightly different aspect of this theme—not the 
responsibility of the prize winner for his own career, 
but the responsibility of prize winners individually 
and collectively for the place that learning is to com­
mand in the judgment of our fellow' countrymen. 
For be sure, not only that each prize winner will be 
judged by what he does afterward—a self-evident 
fact—but that scholarship is going to be judged by 
what its prize winners accomplish—a fact not equally 
self-evident, but equally important for the future of 
the community.
“Let me begin this part of my address by an illus­
tration which belongs largely to the past rather than 
the present, and whose lessons we may therefore 
judge more dispassionately.
"Two generations ago the intellectual idol of the 
graduate and students of most of our colleges was 
the leading debater. The art of extempore speaking 
was cultivated among all classes of students. Its 
almost eminent practitioners were admired to an 
.extent which now' finds no parallel. Whether the de­
bates of that day were much better than the debates 
of today we need not undertake to decide. Our fath­
ers for the most part think that they were; our grand­
fathers are unanimously sure they were. On the 
other hand, the printed specimens of prize debates 
that have come down to us would indicate that if 
our fathers and grandfathers were right the speeches 
have suffered greatly from cold and storage. Be 
this as it may, the leading debater was the man wiio 
won the largest meed of admiration, so that college 
authorities were often led to deplore the solid rudi­
ments of Greek and Hebrew for the meretricious 
joys of oral English expression.
“Now it is no longer the debater, but the athlete, 
who occupies the centre of the stage. Now it is no 
longer success in oratory, but success in sport, which 
is over-idolized.
“Whether we should be better off if we had less 
athletic interest in our colleges and universities is 
a matter about which there may be difference of opin­
ion. There is, I think, no difference of opinion that 
we should be a great deal better off if public attention 
were more largely fixed on the intellectual prizes and 
less exclusively upon the athletic one.
“This result is not going to be reached by mere 
talk, whether against athletics or in favor of scholar­
ship. About half a century ago, not far from the 
time w'hen Charles William Eliot was in the Harvard 
boat, the President of Harvard wrote a letter to the 
President of Yale, in wrhich he-called upon him for 
assistance in stopping the contemptible and demoral­
izing sport of intercollegiate boat racing. But the 
efforts were bound to be fruitless. Why? Not be­
cause intercollegiate boat racing is particularly in­
teresting to watch. I can imagine no other ordinary 
occupation of human life where you go so far and see 
so little as does the spectator at an intercollegiate 
boat race. It was because men of the type of Charles 
William Eliot wrere in the Harvard boat. It is be­
cause people are willing to go anywhere, in any num­
ber, to watch the first public appearance of men who 
are likely to be the leaders and heroes of the next 
generation.
“The way to make the American people more inter­
ested in' scholarship than in athletics is by proving 
that our prize scholars, even more than our prize

lication they can be gotten through “The

athletes, represent the type of men for which there 
is public need. If our scholarships and prizes are 
so arranged that the prize is an end in itself, nobody 
but the prize winners themselves an I their immedi­
ate friends is likely to be interested. If the competi­
tions are so arranged that the prize winners justify 
their selection by their subsequent life, then a col­
lege prize day becomes an occasion of moment to 
the nation.
"Two things are necessary for this end. First, 
our prize scholars must do distinguished public ser­
vice, using this phrase in its broad sense; and sec­
ond, their names must be made widely known. The 
chief value of an occasion like this, apart from the 
pleasure which it gives your families and friends, 
is that it' makes known to the public and promotes 
the second of these objects. But let it be remem­
bered that without the first the second is useless. 
If our prize winners are mere prize winners and no­
thing else, the more we advertise their names the 
more we emphasize their limitations.
“Can we honestly say thatx the prize winners ;n 
our American universities have done as much for the 
public as the public has a right to expect? I wish I 
were sure of the answer. That the men who have 
attained scholastic distinction at Harvard have won 
more than their proportionate share or honor and 
distinction in the world at large has been made evi­
dent by the investigations of Profes-sor Lowell. I 
believe the same thing to have been true of other 
colleges and universities. I do not think, however, 
that the proportion is nealy as decisive as it ought 
to be. If, as we all believe, the central object of a 
university is the development of intellectual proceses 
and intellectual standards, it is not enough for the 
men who have shown themselves pre-eminent in these 
lines to do considerably better than others in service 
to their fellow men; they ought to do overwhelming­
ly better.' We should not rest satisfied until we have 
practically eliminated from the ranks of the prize 
winners those who are going to allow themselves 
either to rest content with their college achievements 
or to drift into sterile lines of investigation which 
benefit no one.
“Nor have we made as much progress in this direc­
tion during the last thirty years as might fairly have 
been expected. These have oee.i years of intellectual 
awakening in all our colleges. The methods of the 
teachers are better than they were. The work of the 
advanced students is a great deal better than it was.
I am afraid, however, that the influence of the lead­
ing scholars in the life of the college community 
has not increased. Until about ten years ago, the 
proportion of first-class men—of men who by ante­
cedents, character, and all round interest affairs, 
were likely to be leaders—who seriously entered into 
the spirit of scholastic prize winning has tended 
to diminish rather than increase. This was, I sup­
pose, the inevitable result of the elective system. In 
the old days when there was a college curriculum, all 
the memebrs of a class saw what the others could do 
in recitation; and the man who had the instinct for

eral interest in life has no apparent inducement to 
try for scholastic prizes.
“There is some tendency in many of our institu­
tions—less, I believe, here than elsewhere—to devel­
op a distinct class of prize winners; of men of spec­
ialized interests rather than of general power, who 
over-estimate the value and meaning of early suc­
cesses and who are not able in after life to do work 
commensurate with the promise of their university 
record. Lord Kelvin, in some respects perhaps the 
best mathematician that Cambridge developed dur­
ing the last century, was beaten for a senior wran- 
glership by a man who never afterward produced 
anything more meritorious than an elementary text­
book on comic sections; because the small man had 
been content to train himself for prize winning, while 
the large man had trained himself for service. If 
there had been many such cases, it would have sound­
ed the death-knell of the Cambridge system. A 
scholastic system which makes prize winners of the 
large men can stand; one of the small men must 
perish.
“This tendency is made more dangerous by the 
number of prizes now given in our universities which 
offer a considerable sum of money to the recipient. 
This is a difficulty which it is almost impossible for 
university authorities to avoid. A graduate or friend 
of the institution desires to stimulate interest in a 
particular subject; he therefore offers a prize large 
enough, in his judgment, to be worth competing for.

THE TARTANNK
Up to a certain point this is well. A substantial 
recognition commensurate with the honor increases 
the keenness of competition. But when, as some­
times happens, the money recognition is more than 
commensurate with honor, it attracts competition of 
the wrong kind—competition of men who seek the 
money rather than the honor, and who are never 
likely in after life to do public service corresponding 
to the distinction which has been accorded them. 
We talk about the evils of professionalism in ath­
letics. There is ten times more immediate danger 
from professionalism in scholastic prize winning 
than there is in all the intercollegiate contests with 
which Harvard and Yale are likely to have anything 
to do. A man becomes a professional when he enters 
into a competition designed to show' what he can 
do, and uses it to see what he can get. It is this 
kind of professionalism which, to quote an expressive 
phrase of your President, has honey-combed our grad­
uate departments; it is this which constitutes the 
greatest menace to true scholarship in America.
“Every man of you who today has received a prize 
has the opportunity to avoid these evils by making 
the prize more honorable. If, as I sincerely trust, 
each one of you here, in the 'ten years that are to 
come, adds reputation to the prize which he has 
won by doing service for set 3)10.3 and for his fellow- 
men, it will shed lustre on the whole list. He will 
make men outside the College see that Harvard 
prize winning and American prize winning mean 
what they ought to. Every such career will make the
competitions of the future more attractive and more 
stimulating. The undergraduates as a body will see 
that success in these lines is the surest harbinger 
of success in after life. If the prize winners of the 
College today are the strong men of the nation to­
morrow, the strong men of the College tomorrow 
will all want to be prize winners. When that con­
summation is reached, and not till then, will intel­
lectual ambition and intellectual life come to its own 
as the dominant element in a university of free and 
self-directing students, anxious to prepare them­
selves for the citizenship of a free and self-directing 
state.
“At the beginning of this address I welcomed you 
to the seat perilous. I welcome you none the less 
cordially now that its perils have been set forth— 
the perils which beset the occupant and the perils 
which beset the seat itself. It was because Abraham 
Lincoln knew the perils both to himself and to the 
seat, and had them heavily in mind all through that 
weary journey from Springfield to Washington in 
1861, that he was able to surmount them all and be­
come the leader of his people in fact as well as 
in name. When the timj conns to each of you. as it 
came to Galahad of old, when the ‘good and ancient 
man' shall lift the veil which hides the place where 
the name of the true occupant is written, may it 
appear that the seat perilous is yours by right; so 
that the knights gathered about the table may say 
of you, ‘This is indeed he by whom the Sangreal is 
achieved!’ ”
