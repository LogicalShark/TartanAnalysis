LAWRENCE PAQUIN DIRECTOR
Because of the fact that the pro­
ceeds from this year’s Arts Division 
Musical comedy, “Ship Ahop,” will be 
given entirely to boost subscriptions 
to' the Athletic Fund Drive, the occa­
sion should he one of more than usual 
interest to the whole school. When 
the details of the present production 
were being worked out, it was de­
cided to give the proceeds to the 
Athletic Council or the Varsity Class, 
hut as the drive was not even spoken 
of at that time, there was no definite 
course -of action determined upon. 
Later it was decided to use the pro­
ceeds to further the drive, hut the com­
mittee neglected to publish this in­
tention broadcast on the campus think­
ing it evident to any one that they 
were not conducting the production for 
personal gain. Some of the students 
seem to have taken a different view of 
the matter, however, which neces9» 
tated the publication of a fact which 
seemed self-evident to those in 
charge of the show.
The production is heing made h> 
people experienced in their lines of 
work and will he comparable to any 
commercial shows.
The stoi’y was written by George 
Goodrich; who is the most promising 
comedy playwright of the Drama 
School. He is considered the best 
farcical writer and funster at Tech. 
The plot is original and clever; a 
credit to any experienced theatrical 
writer of New York. That the public 
will enjoy an evening of real mirth is 
assured.
-Lawrence Paquin is the director. 
Upon him rests the responsibility of 
production. Few people realize the 
amount, of work required to success­
fully put on a show of this caliber. 
It requires the selection and organiz­
ing of the best talent; besides other 
-details too numerous to mention. Mr. 
Paquin directed pageants and other 
productions and is well qualified to 
handle the job. He is also a close 
observer and a student of promising 
. ability.
The plot will take us across the 
ocean to Spain, under the ocean to 
an island in the Southern seas. The 
chief characters are a young American 
who is very much attracted by the 
women. With him is his valet, who is 
the mirth producer. There are four 
scenes: Aboard ship, a port in
Spain, under the sea in Davy Jones’ 
locker, and an isolated island. The 
under sea scene is especially good.

SOME OF THE CARGO OF “SHIP AHOY”
MAGGIE MURPH PROM 
BRILLIANT SUCCESS
It has come—and it has gone! 
In other words, the Girls’ Junior Prom 
of 1921 is now just a rosy memory.
Everybody is saying, "Didn’t .the 
time fly? Why I had no idea it was 
over when they played the last 
•dance!”
And not a girl is saying,. “No, I 
•didn’t have nearly as nice a time as I 
expected.” So that old saw about an­
ticipation and realization has been 
«disproved.
The Schenley ball room was the 
place and was decorated with palms 
and the class colors, maroon' ,and 
gold. Deep red’roses were used on 
the card tables and potted primroses 
formed the centerpieces on the tables 
at supper.
Miss Breed, Dr. and Mrs. Hammer- 
schlag, Mrs. Verworken, Mr. Ellis and 
the class sponsor, Mrs. Conrad, were 
the only patrons and patronesses who 
could be present.
The grand march started at halt 
after nine and was led by Miss Mary 
Nesbitt, Junior class president, fol­
lowed by Miss Margaret Griffin, the 
Senior class- president.
During the grand march the favors 
(card cases and cigarette cases) were 
given out by Miss Agnes Shepherd, 
one of the committee.
In what seemed an incredibly short 
time supper was announced; The menu 
included:
Chicken Patties.
Bread and Butter Sandwiches.
Ice Cream Moulds.
Cake.
Coffee.
After supper—in just a few min 
utes—it was suddenly 2 o’clock and 
everyone drifted homeward to talk 
over the best Junior Prom yet.

CAMPUS WEEK
That Cainpus Week this year will 
be one of the high spots if not the 
peak in the year’s activities at Tech 
is testified by the early start which 
has been made in planning for this 
important event;. The work has been 
started and is going ahead at a rapid 
rate. The dates which have been set 
for Campus Week are May 12, 13 and
14.
COSMOPOLITAN CLUB 
H0L03 ROUMANIAN NIGHT
“Dem” Demancesco, Royal 
Roumanian Consulate, Also 
Tech Student Host
Roumanian night, given under the 
auspices of the Royal Roumanian 
Consulate last Saturday night, proved 
to be a liugh success. The first part 
of the evening was given over to 
talks, incidents, songs and displays, 
which enlightened the members to the 
high position Roumania holds in cul­
ture and civilization. A beautiful dis­
play of Roumanian embroideries was 
shown, to the delight of the ladles who 
attended. Last, but by no means 
least, Mr. Taylor of the Forge Shop, 
gave an informal talk on the position 
Roumania holds in the civilized world.
“Dem” Demancesco, assisted by a 
number of efficient helpers, .was the 
host, and it must be said that he 
quite rose to the occasion, by pro­
viding a varied and interesting en­
tertainment. “Dem” not only described 
some of his most interesting ad­
ventures, but’ also obliged with sev­
eral songs which he rendered in his 
usual inimitable fashion. He was ably 
assisted by his helpers.
The second part of the evening was 
given over to “tripping the light fan­
tastic” and- it certainly was a fine 
dance. Thé orchestra was one of the 
best which Pittsburgh boasts, and the 
evening was without doubt a banner 
one for the Cosmopolitan Club.

CATHOLICS RUN CLOSE
DEPT. HEADS SPEAK AT
INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY
Last Wednesday the Industries Divi­
sion held their usual weekly assembly. 
Mr. Sanders of the A. E. F. commit­
tee started things off by an emphatic 
appeal to the Industries men to spare 
no efforts in getting subscriptions for 
the athletic drive.
Dean Morris then gave a short talk 
about the curriculum of the Industries 
school and outlined the plans upon 
which the courses were started. Pro-, 
fessors Leighon, Leeds and Darnells 
were called on and spoke upon their 
various departments and the courses 
relating to them. Professor Leighon 
gave especially important data on the 
recent investigation of the course 
which the Society of Industrial En­
gineers advocate and pointed out that 
the original course, as laid out four 
years ago, is identical.
Several erring Plebes furnished 
many good laughs from Their superi­
ors. Two Plebes of' Hebrew 
origin, gave a lengthy and laughable 
debate on "Irish Home Rule.” The
In a fast, scrappy game of basket 
ball, played in the Tech gym on last 
Friday, the Tech squad defeated 
Georgetown hy a narrow margin with 
a final score of 32 to 30. This made 
the fourth straight defeat for George­
town in Western Pennsylvania.
The whole game was closely con­
tested and fast, but with tho begin­
ning of the second half both teams 
rallied in au attempt to increase the 
margin of the score, with Tech two 
points in the lead, resulting in rough 
play and the calling of numerous 
fouls against both teams.
The first half closed with a score of
13 to 11 in favor of the Tartans and as 
yet no substitutions on either team. 
At the beginning of the second half 
Georgetown entered Flavin for 
O’Byrne.' Flavin scored three goals 
but was soon disabled and had to 
leave the game. Dosey opened the 
play for the Tartans with a goal from 
the tlpoff. The play was close, and at 
a tie for a moment, but several fouls 
called on the Georgetown men gave 
Tech the chance to regain their lead. 
Tech was rushed hard during the last 
few minutes of play, with their op­
ponents gaining steadily when time 
was called.
Captain Zazilla of Georgetown play­
ed consistently and was strongly 
backed by O’Connell and Carney. 
They played a good game of ball, but 
were handicapped by themselves, in 
that they allowed Tech too many 
chances to score foul goals.
The Tech men pulled together well 
in the field, while Dosey scored with 
regularity for them on the foul goals. 
Gibson showed up well in his speed 
and shooting ability, making four field 
goals for the Tartans. Captain Ham- 
mann and Bell likewise added to the 
score by making several baskets while 
Pittmann and McPhee hung close to 
their men at guard. The summary and 
lineup:
Georgetown. Tech.

JUNIOR PROM
HONUS WAGNER COACH
As the basket ball season is nearly 
over, preparations have been begun 
in the developing of What may be the 
most successful baseball season In 
the history of Tech. The schedule Is 
now complete with the exception of 
one game with Union of Detroit, Which 
is not yet certain.
The veterans who are expocted to 
report include Capt. Ray Doherty, J. 
Doherty, Lynn, Dvlleskis, Durkin, God- 
den. Oakley, Wiess, Warrick, McCaw, 
and Fischer. The now mon who

South High, Youngstown; Cappe of 
Westlnghouse High; Daughorty of 
Grove City and also Catlln, a big six- 
foot southpaw. w
All new men who have had experi­
ence in the game are to be encouraged 
to report to Mgr. Tosteson, In ordor 
that he may got a better line on his 
material. There is a groat need for 
pitchers, especially southpaws, so If 
you are a southpaw, show the old 
¦ppirit and get in the workouts which 
begin for battery men this week.
J. Honus Wagner of old Pirate 
fame, will coach the team again this 
season. “Hans” has always cherished 
the fact of being with the boys and 
gives his best in order to produce the 
best results, so let’s do our part and 
a most successful season can he ex­
pected.
The team will make two big trips. 
The first trip will be when they meet

BUFFALO CLUB SMOKER
After the University of Buffalo- 
Carnegie Tech Basketball game last 
Thursday night, a smoker was given 
by the Buffalo Club for the members 
of the team representing the colleges 
of that city.
The affair, which took place in the 
Science club room, was enjoyed by 
about 50 members cf the club and 
their guests. Sahdwiches and coffee 
were served. Coach PowelL of the U. 
of Buffalo was called upon to say a 
few words and he expressed his sur­
prise and delight at the novelty of 
being entertained by Buffalo men, 
while away on a trip. As far hack as 
he could remember, in the history of | 
the trips of that institution's teams, 
they had never had that privilege ac­
corded them before.
The members of the team were then 
called upon, and all responded, say­
ing much the same as Coach Powell 
with regard to their entertainment.

The Paris prize, which is given un- 
dor tho dlroctlon of tho Boaux Arts So­
ciety, was takon by nine mon of tho 
school ol' architecture last Saturday.
Thin was tho first preliminary In 
which 15 men nro selected to compote 
In the socond elimination. Tho sub­
ject of this first problem was an end 
facade of an art museum.
Any one under 29 years of ago who 
is an American Is eligible' to compote, 
providing the work is supervised by a 
recognized atelier. In tho second 
competition 10 111011 are dropped, leav­
ing five to try for the final, which is 
held in Now York. The successful 
contestant wins $3,000, which provides 
for two years’ study in Paris.
The winner of the second prize be­
comes an alternative in event the 
first cannot go. This second man will 
also reecive a sum of money.
Last year Russel Simpson of this 
school won second in the finals. He 
was very much considered for first. 
Several years ago "Bis” King won 
second prize. This year it is hoped 
that we may get placed first.
The Senior problem1, "A Municipal 
Warehouse,” was judged last week. 
The results were second medals for 
Crosby, Lashmit and Dierks. Four 
men received zeros, or what is known 
as stings. Eighteen problems were 
submitted.
The Juniors and Sophomores, “A 
State Dining Room” and “A Circular 
Portico,” were finished last Saturday 
night after one of the wildest 
charrettes seen for a long time.

Seven thousand one hundred and 
sixty-seven dollars.
These significant figures are the 
exact total for all student activity in 
the A. E. F. campaign, including tho 
results of Touchdown Day, when 
every under-graduate in the school 
was given a half-holiday for the one 
express purpose and idea of aiding 
in the movement, and to secure the 
maximum of one pledge promised tho 
Athletic Council Executive Committee 
by the student leaders at the begin­
ning of the drive. In discussing the 
student activity 011 Saturday, Graduate 
Manager Frank II. Haaren, chairman 
of the campaign committee, said:
“The committee realizes full well 
the fact that many students were un­
able to secure subscriptions to tho

lack of familiarity with the neighbor­

NEWS
Wc often wonder just what constitutes news. It seems to vary 
in nature even with the individual medium through which it is 
distributed to the public, but in the average newspaper there is 
one tiling of which you can be sure. .If the material you want to 
put across is at all lurid or the least bit “off color,” or even open to 
such interpretation when not so intended, it’s what the newspapers 
want. They will tell you it’s what the public wants, and as they are 
supposed to have their finger on the public pulse, they ought to 
know. But we would like to believe that a paper with some other 
view in existence could be a success, although the hope of seeing 
one is slight. The editorial which we published on short skirts a 
few weeks ago has been quoted, to our knowledge, from Washington, 
D. C., to Milwaukee, Wis.—the parts which could he clipped and 
made to appear startling being used.
The Pittsburgh newspapers will use pictures of people in cos­
tume with little attention being paid to the costume itself if a well 
turned limb can be featured, and in every way we are convinced 
that news has a great deal to do with the risque.
If this is so, The Tartan should be a flat failure, as we haven’t 
had a scandal this year. If anyone can oblige us with some real news 
as the newspapers seo it we may bo able to make a bigger hit with 
our student public, but according to our experience, the college news­
paper must be an entirely different bird from the one conducted for 
the general public. There are, as far as we can see, several different 
bnmds of news, and a good many of the papers of Pittsburgh want
tho worst. ____________________________________________________

At Union wo stayed in some ilno

real gymnasium, which had a 40-acre 
field for a basket ball lloor. The next 
day was Bert’s (the trainer) birthday 
ao in the evening before the game 
Skitch Henderson gave the. usual line 
and presented a little token from the 
team. Bert made his usual three- 
word speech and then rubbed us dowu 
with some stuff that made Pittnjan 
think he could jump over the moon.
The citizens of Troy were enduring 
a street ,car strike. One lady asked 
Bell if we were strike breakers. He 
answered, "No,” and almost passed 
away when she remarked, "Well, you 
look like one." Buckets (Bell) cer­
tainly succumbs to the female of the 
species. We met Grant Stone, ’20, 
who acted as timekeeper at Union-and 
Itennsaleer. A man came around to 
Bell after the Union game and asked 
him ii he were related to Strangler 
Lewis, and when Buckets denied the 
relationship, told him that in the game 
lie had a porfect. strangle hold on one 
Union player.

ho reached 200 ho walked in the road 
because he couldn’t count any higher. 
Saturday morning a lady approached 
Bert from the rear and said, "Hollo.
Davie, I want to congratulate ------.”
Bang, Bert turned around. "Oh, I beg 
your pardon, I thought you were Mr.

THE 8CIENCE ASSEMBLY
The Science ABsembly of la»t week 
was honored with the presence of a 
faculty member reputed to be im­
bued with the greatest amount of 
Tech spirit known to any member of 
that body. In his talk he dwelt 
upon the real Carnegie man as “one 
who gives the best he has, boostB at 
all times and is loyal to his mates and 
Institution."
The Pleb.e regulations committee 
furnished further amusement for those 
present by removing the hair from the 
head of one unruly person and by 
further demonstrating on the face of 
another that beautiful effects with 
paint and brush are produced in other 
places besides the Paint Department 
across the way. Further operations 
are promised If tho Plebes continue to 
break regulations.

M. M. D. DISCUSSION CLASS
The Thursday Noon Discussion 
Class did not meet last week on ac-
count of tlje absence of Mrs. Scales. 
It will meet Thursday as usual in 
305. Mrs. Scales and Miss Helene 
Pope have been attending the N. E.
A. convention in New York City.
B. T. U. CLUB.
On Friday afternoon, February 18, 
the B. IV U. club offered an entertain­
ment in the way of a fife reel movie 
in room 104, Industries. "The Birth 
of a Bath Tub" proved to be a big 
feature educational film and aroused 
real interest among those who at­
tended. The scene of the play was 
laid at the foundries and factories of 
the Standard 'Sanitary Mfg. Co. and as 
the name, suggests, dealt with the 
manufacture of the much-abused bath 
tub. Incidentally other articles of 
sanitary ware were likewise shown in 
their various stages of Construction. 
As not even luxury tax was charged 
for admission the movie v?as well at­
tended. Foundry and machine pro­
duction men were among the spec­
tators.

this time, of sending cards to mother,

scribbled on them. We missed 
peach of a dance at Itennsaleer. I 
think the women in that town are 
effecting unusual economics. A good 
many of the skirts would have done 
credit to a Follies chorus girl (or girls 
in a good many other towns in the 
United Slates), but we didn’t kick 
about having to watch. It is rumored 
that some of the follows did dance.

Tho next day on the train to Buffalo 
wo met tho Syracuse track team,

Boll: "Ah, who's buen lookin’ at mo

that tho reservations to Pittsburgh 
had been secured for that evening. As

we wore in luck. Everybody had beon

PIPE ALL HANDS—SHIP AHOY— 
WHERE AWAY
In your editorial of last week on 
the Science S'moker you expressed the 
view that the smoker "refutes the 
general impression on the campus 
that the grind of technical studies de­
stroys all spontaneity in the student 
and renders him incapable of appre­
ciation . of anything alien to his 
specialty."
That the smoker was alien to his 
specialty everyone will admit. But 
so are insanity and crime. The 
trouble is that some of the stunts 
perpetratedt there were far too alien 
to be representative of college' stud­
ents boasting of "Tech spirit" and 
"Tech ideals.” One is forced to ask 
what that spirit and what those 4deals 
are and what they signify. For there 
was little there that Bmaclced of com­
mendable spirit or elevated ideals. 
Several weeks ago Professor Kara- 
petoff complained to us that American 
students take too little interest in 
economic advancement and reform 
Many. noted educators have pointed 
out that while the European student 
commands the respect of his com­
munity and while the European uni­
versity is the source of enlightened 
and democratic reform, the American 
student is often a pestilence to his 
community and his college a strong­
hold of inactivity or of reaction.
Doe3 the Science Stag refute any 
of these charges? Surrounded by so 
much art, with so much opportunity to 
learn to love one’s work, with recrea­
tion in the gymnasium and in the 
library, besides the»- pleasure of a 
walk, a conversation, a theater—must 
we then stoop to the dregs for enter­
tainment? Is there no other field 
for spontaneity than degeneracy?

STUDENT VESPERS
Dr. Galpin of the First Baptist 
church will give the address at the - 
student vesper service tomorrow. His 
subject will be chosen with particular ^ 
thought for the college student and 
all who know him will need no. sec­
ond invitation. Music will be fur­
nished by the male quartet of the Pitt 
*Glee Club. Service begins at 4:45 in 
the First Baptist church, Bellefield and 
Bayard streets, two blocks northwest 
of the library.
MENORAH SOCIETY
At a special meeting of the Menorab’ 
Society the following officers were 
elected: President, Mr. Sigal, Tech;,
vice president, Mr. S. Komfeld, Pitt; 
secretary, Miss C. Ruderman, Pitt; 
treasurer, Miss A. Alpern, Pitt; social 
chairman, Miss A. Fineman, Pitt.
The next meeting will be held on 
Tuesday, March 8, at the Rodef 
Shalom Temple, Fifth avenue.
THE DAVIS
An all headline program of Keitb. 
vaudeville will be at the Davis 
theater during the week beginning 
Monday, March 7. Valerie Bergere, 
•and her ¦company, in "Tbe Moth,” a. 
playlet by Emmet Deboy, and Mul- 
doon, Franklyn & Rose, a trio of en­
livening entertainers, share the top 
of tbe bill, while Ruth Roye, the 
peerless comedienne of syncopation, 
comes as a special feature attraction.
THE GRAND
Next week the Grand pre­
sents Pola Negri in the nine reel 
super-drama “Passion. It contains a 
cast of 5,000 persons in addition to the 
superb acting of the fascinating star 
and a group of splendid principals. 
“Passion" is founded upon the fascin­
ating story of Jeanne Du Barr and 
Louis XV of France. Miss Negri, 
who has long been the principal con­
tinental star of the films who has 
never been seen before in this coun­
try, portrays with extraordinary art- 
tistry the role of the vivacious little 
milliner who rose to the place of 
king’s favorite and thus ruled France-
(Continued From Page One.)
The scenery has been designed by 
Bill McQuillan. Henry De. Wolf and 
Arthur Anderson. All these men 
have had practical work outside of 
school.
The costumes, which are the best 
that havo ever been seen in this 
vicinity, were designed by Hans 
Muller. Mr. Muller has been engaged 
in costume designing in New York. 
Ho will also sing four numbers. The 
musical numbers are new and or­
iginal, written by Schmertz, Hertz- 
bcrg, Snyder, Frey, Rosenthal and 
O’NeiL
Dances are being devloped and 
drilled by Doug Colfield, Gray, Mc­
Cauley and Dorothy Chalmers. 
Lucille Flanders, who was at school 
last year, will give a Russian dance 
which will be an attraction.
The “Artistech" Jazz Band, organ- 
| Ized by “Eva" Hughes, will render 
some wild numbers in musical synco­
pation known and unknown to Tech 
students.
The parts of Bob Adams and Jon- 
lcons, tho valet, are taken by Jack 
Willard and Eddie Itoir, respectively. 
Upon, the travel and adventure ol‘ 
those characters is based the plot.
Mary Lessfolt is tho loading lady, 
playing the part of Cynthia Berkley.
Tho comedians are Gaither, Hertz 
and McClure. Mr. McClure, known as 
Hoovu Gangway, Is tho queen of tho 
Island of “I Don’t Care" and, sup- i 
ported by Hertz and Gaither, will 
provoke many laughs.
Thero are many other people who 
are doing fine work, but space will 
not permit mention. The committee, of! 
course, deserves a share of credit.
Summing up the show in a general! 
way it will be too good to miss. • 
Profiting by the experience of last 
year, many defects have been elimin-| 
ated. The production will be run 
off more smoothly and will be a 
show of credit to the school.
The ticket sale has been rapid from 
the start. The house will be packed 
both nights. The committee wanted 
to give the students an opportunity to 
secure seats, therefore, seats were 
put on sale on the campus first. The 
public sale has been big owing to 
the publicity outside of the school. 
Any students planning on going must 
secure tickets immediately.
Georgetown introduced aTnew minor 
sport last Saturday, January 22nd, 
when the rifle team of the R. O. T. C., 
representing the University, defeated 
the Lehigh University rifle team by 
a margin of 35 points. Members of 
the R. O. T. C., together with Major 
William Hobson, professor of military 
science and tactics at the University, 
had long contemplated having a rifle 
team at the college, and last w'eek’s 
successful competition with Lehigh 
will undoubtedly make shooting a per­
manent. sport at the Hilltop,—Hoya.

The basket ball team closes their season this week end with) the Buck- 
nell and Geneva contests. The Plaid passers have shown great improvement 
in the last few weeks and should give the boys from Lewisburg a hard fight 
next Thursday night. Bucknell'has a fast team which, has won a majority of 
their games this year and looking forward to making a clean sweep of their 
Western Pennsylvania trip. The Skibos will go to Beaver Falls on Satur­
day for the concluding game \yith Geneva. They won from the Methodists 
once before this year and should turn the trick again.

RIFLE TEAM BREAKS EVEN
The results of the first dual matches of the rifle team held last wreek with 
Princeton and Harvard show the Plaid target men have been making rapid 
progress. The team’s showing is on the upgrade and much is expected of 
them in the coming matches -with Colgate and Columbia, although these 
teams are making the highest records. Much credit is to be given to the 
men on the team as they have organized their own sport and put up their 
range.

PLEBE QUINTET WINS 
LAST THREE CONTESTS
Scaled Tldit 
-Kept RisbtTHEFLAVOtLASTS
The Plebes opened up a winning 
streak Thursday night when they wal­
loped the Aluminum basketball team 
to the tune of 42-30 at Tech gymnas­
ium. The game was a preliminary to 
the Tech-Buffalo game, and a good 
crowd was on hand to see the Plebes 
perform. The game was fast but the 
Tartans were in the lead at all times.
The Plebes started strong and ran 
up 15 points, while Aluminum was se­
curing 3, in the first quarter. They 
continued the good work in the second 
period,, which ended 27-9. At the start 
of the second half, Smith thought Tech 
had too much of a lead and he caged 
a goal for Aluminum. This was the 
most exciting play of the evening. 
This did not stop the Plebes any for 
the third quarter ended 3G-18. The 
Tartans slowed down in the last quar­
ter and the final score being 42-30.

Plebes, Friday night at Tech Gym, the 
score being 32-28. It was a prelim­
inary to the Tech-Georgetown game.
Tech took the lead at the beginning 
and continued throughout the game. 
The first half ended 18-13, Tech. In 
this period Jones shot 7 out of 8 fouls, 
missing only the first one. The Plebes 
increased their lead during'the third 
quarter, the score being 27-18. In

The Plebes made it three straight by 
downing South Hi^jpSchool, Saturday 
night at Tech Gym, 33-26. The game! 
was slow and not much fight was dis­

after having played hard games the 1 
two previous nights. The large num­

the game.

SKIBO HOCKEYISTS TRIP 
- ALL-SCHOLASTIC TEAM
Saturday afternoon the Tech hockey 
team defeated the All-Scholastics of 
Pittsburgh, 2-0.
The game was an excellent one, the 
high Bchool'boys giving the Tech team 
a good run to deserve the victory. This 
team is composed of the best players 
in the high schools, tutored under such 
men as Larry and Joe McCormick, 
Mooseau and “Dinny” Manners. They 
have been playing together for about 
two months and in that time have de­
veloped a star team.
The ice was right for a fast game 
and the gairie was a lively one, played 
before a large crowd.
The McShorley brothers of Sclienley 
High, were the best for the High 
school boys,, and Hedlund was Tech’s 
best bet, as he stopped many shots 
from all angles. Quinn and Sclimertz 
each scored for Tech.
NAVY BLADESMEN BEAT YALE
Navy’s fencing team overwhelmed 
the Yale swordsmen at Annapolis on 
Saturday afternoon by the score of
11 bouts, to five. Foils, sabers and 
dueling swords were the weapons 
used.
Winter track is now the vogue in 
the University of Utah, and every day 
a large number of track aspirants are 
to be seen in the gym working the 
stiffness out of their muscles and get­

the weather permits they may begin 
intensive 'training in the outdoor 
events. It is planned to stage an in- 
‘door track meet in the near future, 
this meet to be an interclass affair. 
From the material in training at the 
present time all indications point to 
a very interesting event^ for the track

in shooting fouls, but made up for it 
by securing 4 field goals. Klinzing 
shot poorly in the first half but his 
foul shooting in the second was great­
ly improved. He was the whole

Unable to reverse the defeat of a 
week before, Carnegie Tech was 
nosed out by the University of Buffa­
lo basket ball team, 29-24, last Thurs­
day night on the Tech court.
The game was an unusual one, the 
Buffalo five, using a new style of play 
which was rather puzzliug to the ^ar- 
tan boys until the end of the second 
half, when they started a strong come­
back. During the first half, the game 
was an evenly matched affair, but. 
there seemed to be a jinx on the 
Tech basket, as the shots which 
seemed as if they must go in, just 
spun around the ring of the basket 
and fell off. Time after time this 
happened, and the only thing which 
kept the Tech boys from beiug far 
behind in this half was the foul 
shooting of Dosey. During the first 
half Tech scored but once, from the 
court, Allen- Weirman, dropping one 
in from the center of the court. All 
the other points being made by fouls.
The Blue and White showed their 
wonderful ability at caging long shots 
from the center of the court, all their 
points in the first half, except two 
coming from such field goals. Cohn 
shot fouls very poorly. The first 
period of the game ended 14-11, Buffa­
lo leading.
The second half was a clever show­
ing of passworlc and dribbling. The 
Buffalo five, adopted their new style 
of play, and just passed the ball among 
themselves, not attempting to ad­
vance. Long advanced the ball sev­
eral times, dribbling, and it was the 
best dribbling seen here this season. 
During the early part of this half, 
Tech scored only two fouls.
The wearers of the Plaid called 
time out, with only eight minutes of 
play remaining, and then staged a 
wonderful comeback. In the first three 
minutes they scored three field goals 
and two fouls. This brought them 
within three points of the leaders. 
Buffalo again resumed their peculiar 
style of defensive play and prevented 
further scoring.
Dosey, Hamman and Nichol were the 
best for Tech, and Weirman made his 
presence felt in his fast playing. Long 
was the outstanding star of the game, 
his dribbling and shooting being won­
derful. Siegel and Leicht played well 
for Buffalo.

At the Duquesne Gardens last; Mon­
day night the University of Pennsyl­
vania hockey team defeated Carnegie 
Tech atrhockey by the score 2-1. The 
game was a fast one and exciting 
throughout.
Tech played an excellent offensive 
game, their advances toward the Red 
and Blues’ goal being in good forma­
tion, three of the Plaid men, running 
down the ice together, passing the 
puck across. But near the Penn goal 
the defensive play of the Quakers 
proved to be too pinch and the Tar­
tans were forced to run the puck down 
again. In the first period of play, 
Godden, in a whirlwind shot, placed 
the puck in Penn’s cage for Tech's 
only tally.
Penn came back later with a score 
and the two teams fought hard to keep 
the other from scoring.
The score remained tie until the 
very end of the third period, when 
Pringle again scored for Penn.
The game was featured by the won­
derful playing of Pringle of Penn, 
who scored both goals, and “Peac”

SKIBO BASKETBALLERS FALL 
BEFORE LAFAYETTE FIVE
One of the last games on Tech's 
calendar fof this season was played 
on tho home floor Saturday night, 
when the Lafayette five defeated tho 
Tartans with a score of 25 to 23. The 
game was a. hard fought, contest, but 
he 'visitors played a superior gamo 
during the last period of the second 
half, showing their ability to handle 
the ball. The Tech men rallied aud 
displayed their fighting spirit but 
were unable to keep the ball iu their 
control.
Tho first half closed with a score of 
15 to 13, Lafayette in the lead, but 
with the Tartans steaming up aud tho 
game still for Tech to grab in the sec­
ond half. A total of 11 field goals was 
made in the first half with ouly two 
in the second half, tho rest of tho 
score beiug made ou fouls. This was 
due to the increase in passing by tho 
Lafayette men and spirited efforts on 
the part of Tech to gain the lead after 
the score was tied,, 21-21.
Reeves, of Lafayette, provod hits

* What Is Air Pressure?
THE air is composed of molecules. They constantly 
bombard you from all sides. A thousand taps by a 
thousand knuckles will close a barn door. The taps 
as a whole constitute a push. So the constant bombardment 
of the air molecules constitutes a push. At sea-level the air 
molecules push against every square inch of you with a 
total pressure of nearly fifteen pounds.
Pressure, then, is merely a matter of bombarding mole­
cules.
When you boil water you make its molecules fly off. 
The water molecules collide with the air molecules. It takes 
a higher temperature to boil water at sea-level than on Pike’s 
Peak. Why? Because there are more bombarding molecules 
at sea-level—more pressure.
Take away all the air pressure and you have a perfect 
vacuum. A perfect vacuum has never been created. In the 
best vacuum obtainable there are still over two billion mole­
cules of air per cubic centimeter, or about as many as there 
are people on the whole earth.
Heat a substance in a vacuum and you may discover 
properties not revealed under ordinary pressure. A new 
field for scientific exploration is opened.
Into this field the Research Laboratories of the General 
Electric Company have penetrated. Thus one of the chem­
ists in the Research Laboratories studied the disintegration 
of heated metals in highly exhausted bulbs. What happened 
to the glowing filament of a lamp, for example? The glass 
blackened. But why? He discovered that the metal dis­
tilled in the vacuum depositing on the glass.
This was research in pure science — research in what 
may be called the chemistry and physics of high vacua. It 
was undertaken to answer a question. It ended in the dis­
covery of a method of filling lamp bulbs with an inert gas 
under pressure so that the filament would not evaporate so 
readily. Thus the efficient gas-filled lamp of today grew out 
of a purely scientific inquiry.
So, unforeseen, practical benefits often result when 
research is broadly* applied.

ALUMNI ROLL CALL
Tho Bplrit that' used to animate Tech and Tech; student# 'is not dead, 
it OV only Bleeping. It needs to be awakened, nourished • and developed. 
The question in: WHO WILL DQ IT?
We alumni are involved beyond otherB in tlie future of Tech. Wo are 
concerned beyond all others in her welfare and well doing. . An undergrad­
uate may change tlwj bcIiooI, the faculty may obtain positions in other in­
stitutions, but we are sentenced for life to bo Tech men and women. Wo 
cannot rid ourselves of the Tech brand. It 1h ER who haVo inoBt to loso, 
also most to gain. Wo have duties and responsibilities aa well as riches and 
privileges and can make ourselves a most powerful factor* in tho life of 
Tech, a groat safeguard for her future.
WHAT SHALL WE DO?
Make Carnoglo Tech more than an improHBivo monument of 
bricks' and mortar!
Make Tech stand for something!
Develop this spirit Of-Institute!
Fan tho smoldering embers of tho Institution until it becomes a 
living llamo- t
WHAT SHALL TECH 8TAND FOR?
The purpose of its founder, tho history of its development, its 
mission to tho young men and women of today demand that what­
ever olso It stands for, It shell 1 at least stand for a sound body and 
sound scholarship, for honest work and fair play, for clean manhood 
and true democracy.
Those at least must he the attributes of tho spirit of Tech. Make 
thorn real, make thorn stand out In loiters of fire that they will bo 
i burned into tho conscience of the freshman and can never bo for­
gotten by the senior. Establish these so firmly that no ono can 
doubt their reality and no one can weaken their power. Tech is 
our Alma Mater, make that term something more than a .poetic 
figure.
HOW SHALL WE DO THIS?
Back your alumni administration.
Form contact with the Government Bodies of tho Institution, 
the Trustees, the Administration, the Faculty. They all need the 
point of view that wo, and only wo, can give them. Most of all, wo 
should malco ourselves felt In the student life and tho student of 
today is tho alumnus of tomorrow. They are the prospective mein- 
}' hers of our family owning a common Mother, our Alma Mater. Wo
should be a big brother to thorn. In their social affairs, their activ­
ities and in all their school relations, they do not need our dictation, 
but our help.
An educational Institution beyond all other organizations must have dig­
nity and sense of fitness and comparative values and stability of character. 
Havo not wo something to contribute to Tech along this line? Don’t merely 
take a critical stand. Bo. constructive, build something, develop a spirit. 
Don’t bo an nonentity, a negligible factor. Bo charitable, sane, reasonable, 
considerate, but a force.

THE A. E. F. DRIVE
The results of tho Athletic Exten­
sion Fund campaign have been, and 
will continue to be, more far reaching 
than for merely the period of the 
drive itself, in the opinion of members 
of the Athletic Council and Pitts­
burgh Clan who have been active in 
the movement to secure the needed 
funds for tho continuance and main­
tenance of sports at Tech during the 
balance of this year and in 1922. 
They feel that Jn addition to the imme­
diate benefits, such as the realization 
of the fund itself, tho campaign will 
result In bringing to the alumni the 
fact that Tech is now in much the 
same position as are most other 
privately endowed colleges, and uni­
versities with respect to finance: 
That it will bring to them a realiza­
tion of the fact that they owe Alma 
Mater a debt greater than the mere 
attendance at football and basket ball 
games once or twice a year, with per­
haps perfunctory praise of the school 
upon occasion; and it will result lastly 
in acquainting alumni and former 
students with the importance and ben­
efits of aillliation with the Alumni As­
sociation through the nearest clan. *
Tech, because of its comparative 
youth, and the youth of many of its 
alumni; because of the fact that many 
of them are scattered far from Pitts­
burgh and their addresses lost; be­
cause of the natural handicaps it has 
had to overcome, and with many of 
which it is still confronted, has ex­
perienced great difficulty in wielding 
together an alumni organization. 
Through the efiicient and untiring 
efforts of Mr. Batman and Mi‘. Til- 
broolc a remarkable approach to an 
efiicient organization has been effect­
ed and the council members are con­
fident that the drive will aid greatly 
in building up this phase of student 
and alumni activity.
Disappointed as many of the A. E. 
F. executive committee members have 
been over tho failure of many alumni 
to respond to this appeal they have 
not by any means lost hope and con­
viction that most of these men and 
women will at some time in the not 
far distant future become members of 
the alumni organization, and sub­
scribers to tho fund. The campaign’s 
goal, $50,000, realized on Monday 
night last by tho pledge of the student 
leaders and members of the executive 
committee, will assure definitely ln- 
ter-class and lnter-collegiate sport at 
Tech tills year and next, but will make 
110 provision for the beginning of the 
stadium project.
Public support of the movement 
alone guaranteed Its success, for with­
out the hearty and loyal co-operation 
of the alumni teams, aided by those 
from the Wostinghouso Electric nnd 
Manufacturing Company and Du­
quesne Electric and Mfg. Co. and 
others the campaign would havo boom 
a failure. Tho student effort of 
Touchdown Day fell short of the an­
ticipated quota, duo to lack of ac­
quaintance 011 the part of many under 
graduates and ovor-zoalousness on the 
part of others, but tho committee foolB 
that bo far as tho alumni and- former 
student groups are concerned there 
can ho but little oxcuso or reason for 
the lack of co-operation.
To ovory ono of almost 9,000 alumni 
whoso addresses tho school holds full 
details concerning tho campaign wore 
sont, explaining the nature and extent 
of tho need at prosonf; that antici­
pated for next year, and outlining 
plans determined upon by the com 
mlttoo to bring Tech athletics and, 
perhaps, Tech itself, to a higher and 
hotter plane. About 200 of those 
letters came back to the office, due 
to change of address. From those 
known to have been reached directly 
by the' appeal an average of less than 
$1.00 was received for the fund. Are 
you one of these delinquents?
These are the facts as they concern 
the alumni and yourself as one of 
them. If they hurt you may well take 
your share of blame and responsibility. 
If the drive had failed you would have 
been one of the criminally negligent, 
and your responsibility has in no way 
been mitigated by the fact that the 
campaign did reach par. The com­
mittee has recognized the fact that 
industrial conditions are unsettled 
that many men are facing unemploy­
ment; but it is well aware of the fact 
that most Tech alumni are well en­
trenched; and ¡whether employed or 
not, that they still owe Tech a debt 
of allegiance and support that 
has been paid and probably never will 
be paid in full.
You men and women who took 
thousands of dollars each from-the 
campus in the form of increased earn­
ing power, at a cost to yourselves of 
pnly a fraction of that amount; you 
who havo witnessed the untiring and 
over loyal efforts of many grads to 
build up Tocli in a physical as woll 
as a spiritual sense, may woll envy 
tho record of achievement that rests 
upon t.lioso men and women who havo 
labored so well and willingly to reach 
this goal, for to them is duo tho 
credit.
The public intensive campaign is at 
an ond. Tho campaign to reach every 
alumnus with tho appeal is not. The 
pledge given by the oxeCutlve com­
mittee members that tho goal shall bo 
reached will be redeemed. Every 
member of the campaign organization 
will continue his or her efforts until 
every penny of tho committee pledge 
is secured from the alumni. If you
SENIORS!
To the Seniors:
The Alumni Student Placement 
Bureau has for some years endeavored 
to place the graduates of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology in the best 
and most suitable openings offered by 
employers. Every year, during. Feb­
ruary or Marchr the 'Senior class is in­
terviewed with the idea of ’securing 
all the data necessary for, placing the 
right man in the right job. The im­
portance of doing this efficiently is at 
once apparent, if the student-*will stop 
to consider the number 61, men 
graduating each year from’ our col­
leges. All of these men must be 
taken up by industry. ' You* should 
begin at once to think about your 
future and decide what you are best 
fitted for, where you wish to be 
located and what your goal is to be 
finally. Go to your instructors, de­
partment heads, business acquaint­
ances or any one else who may be 
able to give you some of the various 
phases on the various lines you have 
been considering and an idea of what 
you are best fitted for. " ’’
If you are to be well placed after 
graduation in competition with other 
institutions, you must co-operate with 
this bureau from the start.
Appear on schedule time for your 
interview; your tardiness will throw 
off the entire interview schedule.
Fill out. the employment blank 
legibly in detail and have it with 
you when you appear for your inter­
view.
Dp you know the names and ad­
dresses of . firms in which you are in­
terested? You should leara at once 
the executives of such companies 
who might be approached with refer­
ence to your employment.
You should have in mind some 
definite plan for your personal cor­
respondence and solicitations for em­
ployment with such companies.
Be ready to submit such informa­
tion.

TECH BASKET BALL TEAM
TAKES TRIP TO PACIFIC COAST
A good many students around school 
know that wo have a basket ball team 
whose success has been varied and 
seemingly inpredictable. It has beaten 
Geneva very badly, Allegheny in two 
games, Colgate and came closer to 
beating Grove City than any team in 
this section. On the other hand it 
lost to West Virginia, W. and J. and 
was cleaned up at Penn State.
The general Idea of an athletic trip 
is a grand good time; many places are 
visited, now experiences are met and 
tho team has a fine time. Few people 
realize that a trip really Is liaro 
work. The time is mostly spent in 
traveling, sleeping and playing. Ex­
cept on tho last night of the trip, 
dsuices, etc., are forbidden and every­
body must be in bed early, meals are 
irregular, different styles of playing 
and officiate are mot with and prac­
tically .110 sight seeing is done except 
from train windows. Although you 
would not suspoct. it, most athletes are 
thinking about tho missed classes 
which must bo made up and the work 
which that entails.
Tho heading of this article would 
indicate a very extensive trip by the 
basket ball team and such has been 
the case. If a team were to make BDRT 
a trip it would require more than 
two weeks’ loss of school work. Dur­
ing this season our team will have 
traveled at least 6,000 miles, which is 
equal to a trip to the Pacific coast.
Offsetting these circumstances are 
the love of the sport, the school and 
the value of the friendships which are 
formed between the teammates.
What this type of school spirit de­
mands of you, in return* for its sac­
rifices, is approval for victory and loy­
alty in defeat—with only constructive 
criticism. .

TO BE SICK UNTO DEATH
A sweeping change in the college 
yells of the University of Utah is one 
of the greatest needs of the local in­
stitution from the standpoint of de­
velopment of “real spirit” on the east 
bench during athletic contests, ac­
cording to the statement of an East­
ern critic which has been received 
here.
“The JJniversity of Utah has the 
most ineffective- kind of yelling I can 
think of,” the expert said. “I am 
speaking particularly from a poetical 
point of view. They lack the proper 
construction to arouse emotion. All 
tho yells need to be reconstructed.
