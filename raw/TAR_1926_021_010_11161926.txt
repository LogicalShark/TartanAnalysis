J^| ‘tRH”, you’ll say. Quite 
naturally, for CRH is not a sta­
tion. CRH is Clinton R. Hanna, 
age 27, out of Purdue less-than 
fiite years, a Research Engineer' 
with Westinghouse at East '

Any time you’re/listening to, 
your radio, however, you may be 
getting better reception, a clearer 
program, because of CRH and 
the improvements in reproduc­

tributed.- v
That story-goes back to under­
graduate days at. Lafayette. 
Hanna, as a student, developed 
an intense, interest in radio; and, 
making capital out of his hobby, 
his thesis was entitled, “Inter­
rupter Type of Radio Trans­
mitter.”
To carry on his experiments, 
it was logical that Hanna should 
find his way into the, Westing-,

immediately after graduation. ••

•UnitedEstimates . from ' the States Treasury Indicate next'Jane there will be ' a plus of about $250,000,000 suit of federal tes.-,receipts this year. This 8urplus:ar1ees«Ui spite of the fact that there was. conuld erable cut In federal taxes In. tb' current year. It - may be recalled that the Admlnlstratloi what disturbed becaui large cuts vfhlch, v/era made by Congreds and that a deficit was feared.
Because of the.fact that th< Secretary of the -Treasury has taken unfailingly a' pessimistic view es to the receipts, with the 'result, that the Federal Government each .year shows a large Burplus, many peo­ple have been led. to. the conclu- Blon that the. Treasury DeparUDent
- . giveas to why. the amount.of the Go eramenVa " income from taxes should be underestimated. In the first place It Is Imposlble to esti­mate accurately la advance the de­gree of prosperity which the tlon Is. to eojoy in any -cu.fi year, and we-have been-very for­tunate-in experlenclni of years of -unusual - prosperity 'which, have swelled the Goi ment's . Income from both direct and indirect taxes.A farther reason Is that there ai ' always some members of Congre who wish to go much farther than .the Administration In regard 1 the cutttng-.pt taxes and the "li ' creasing df expenditures. As a r 
eult.lt,Is always safer for the eBl mated receipts to be lesB than tfc expected receipts In ord Administration should so! seir In the hole at the . end of ttii year. If the Secretary of th< Treasury bad estimated the fed­eral Income to be larger than wa actually the case.(he Administra­tion would at the present time face an embarrassing situation.At the present'time there, aro various suggestions being present­ed as to what should be done with this surplus The . President fav- "ored a rebate to the tax payers of aboQt 12.per cent of .the amount that they had.paid this^year. Sec­retary Mellon was opposed to this plan andfavcred an allowance to be. grantedIot de&uclicn from the payments to be madedurlxig .the coming year. On the otherhand the Democrats .are. planntag ti> In­troduce .a tax reduction-bill to lighten taxes.
