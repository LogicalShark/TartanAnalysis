Dedication Honors 
Warner’s Presidency
Speeches by Carnegie Tech president H. Guyford Stever 
and President Emeritus John C. Warner highlighted the 
dedication of Warner Hall, Carnegie Tech’s new administra­
tive facility. Beginning at 2:30 pm last Friday with music 
by the Kiltie Band and an invocation by the Reverend Hugh 
S. Clark, the ceremonies served as a tribute both to Carnegie 
Tech’s fourth president and to the donors who made Warner 
Hall possible.

Official response has been enthusiastic to last Wednesday’s announcement of a pro­
posed merger of Carnegie Tech with Mellon Institute to form Carnegie University. Called 
“the most promising occurence in Tech’s 66-/ear history,” by President H. Guyford Stev­
er, the proposal is Sean by deans and depart nent heads to offer a vast potential for Car-
negie Tech.
In his welcoming remarks, 
Stever noted that the new ad­
ministration building provided 
both a more efficient concentra­
tion of all administration func­
tions and made available needed 
classroom space in Baker Hall.
Richard M. Scaife, Governor 
and Vice-President of T. Mel­
lon and Sons, then dedicated 
the building. Scaife’s mother, 
the late Mrs. Alan M. Scaife, 
made the $1,750,000 donation 
for Warner HalL 
Stever, in introducing Presi­
dent Emeritus Warner, recalled 
that many advances made by Car­
negie Tech during Warner’s pres­
idency. The monetary value of 
Carnegie Tech, for example, in­
creased by 161 per cent.

Dr. John Christian Warner, fourth 
president of Carnegie Tech, cuts 
the ribbon to officially open War­
ner Hall.
Warner, speaking on “The Role 
of the Administration in the Uni­
versity,” stated that administra­
tion as an end in itself was un­
satisfactory. Instead, he empha­
sized goals of awareness of new 
knowledge and communication of 
present knowledge to faculty and 
students.
In addition, Warner proposed 
a fourfold set of administrative 
functions: finding and encourag­
ing promising students to enroll; 
rewarding good teaching; pro­
viding leadership for graduate 
students and researchers in their 
quest for knowledge; and culti­
vating new sources of financial 
support for the future.
In closing, Dr. Warner ex­
pressed his gratitude to those 
who proposed his name for the 
new administrative building. 
He noted that Carnegie Tech’s 
pace and quality have not only 
been maintained, but in fact 
have accelerated, and pointed 
out that the proposed Carne­
gie University will constitute a 
great local and national me­
morial to Andrew Carnegie and 
the other benefactors of the 
school.
Following Warner’s speech, 
Henry Lehne, President of the 
Alumni Association, presented the 
Special Service Award to Mrs. 
Warner for the Alümni Associa­
tion, in honor of her devotion 
and dedication.
H’coming Brings Broadway 
To Carnegie Tech Campus
Carnegie Tech will swing amid the sights and sounds 
of the entertainment capital of the world as “Give My Re­
gards to Broadway” is presented as the theme for Home­
coming 1966, October 16.
Leading the list of entertainers 
will be Simon & Garfunkel in 
concert Friday night, Octover 14, 
at Carnegie Music Hall. Harry 
“Boogie-Woogie” Sherman, a 
vaudeville comedian, will star in 
a new Homecoming event, “Vaud­
eville Varieties,” which will be 
presented on the Friday after­
noon of Homecoming Weekend- 
Other acts for the variety 
show are being recruited on 
campus. All groups and indi­
viduals are invited to partici­
pate. Interested persons should 
contact Marion Bauman at 521- 
4597 by Friday, September 30.
Another highlight of Home­
coming Weekend will be the 
crowning of the 1966 Homecom­
ing Queen. Queen candidates will 
be nominated at a meeting of 
all freshman women Monday,
September 26, in the Morewood 
Gardens Recreation Room. All 
freshman commuters are asked 
to attend. Any freshman woman
Homecoming is Coming
is eligible to be nominated by 
any other freshman woman at 
the meeting.
Seven Homecoming Queen semi- 
finalists will be chosen from the 
nominees by representatives of 
campus men’s activities at a tea 
September 28. After the seven 
semi - finalists tour the men’s 
dorms and fraternity houses, a 
final vote will be made by all 
campus men. The 1966 Home­
coming Queen will be crowned 
at the Friday night concert.
Rush Tours Begin Sunday; 
CFP Sets Frosh Rules
Freshmen will get their first chance to visit Carnegie 
Tech’s twelve fraternities at the Council of Fraternity Presi­
dent’s rush tours Sunday, September 25 and Friday, Sep­
tember 30.
These tours, scheduled for 1 to
4 pm Sunday and 7 to 10 pm 
Friday, are open to all freshmen 
and interested upperclassmen. 
Rushees will meet in Skibo ball­
room and will divide into 12 
groups, each conducted by a CFP 
representative for the tour. Each 
group will visit six fraternity 
houses on the first floor and the 
other six on the second tour, so 
freshmen should attend both 
tours if they wish to see all the 
houses.
Appropriate dress for the oc­
casion is coat and tie. CFP will 
set up schedules for more first 
semester rush events and second 
semester formal rush at its next 
meeting.
Rush rules for the fall semes­
ter are given below. They apply 
only to freshmen; upperclassmen 
may rush openly any time.
1) Rushees may contact a 
fraternity at any time.
2) A rushee is permitted in 
a fraternity house only during 
a scheduled rush event or dur­
ing a meeting of a club recog­
nized by Student Congress at 
which time there will be no 
rushing.
3) A rushee is not permitted 
in an apartment associated 
with a fraternity man.
4) Quiet hours will prevail 
in the dorms from 7 pm un­
til 8:30 am each day. Quiet 
hours means that a fraternity 
man shaU not take the initia­
tive in discussing fraternity af­
fairs, although other personal 
contact is all right.
5) Fraternity men are pro­
hibited from giving rushees any­
thing of monetary value. Loan­
ing them motor vehicles is 
against rush rules but giving 
them rides is not.
6) Fraternity men cannot of­
fer rushees alcoholic bever­
ages at any time, in or out of 
fraternity houses. No alcoholic 
beverages may be served at 
any scheduled rush events.
7) No oral or written bids 
may be given before the start 
of formal rush second semes­
ter. No oral or written bids 
may be accepted until the first 
day of pledging.
8) Invitations to attend rush 
functions may be extended by 
individual houses only after 
the party on October 1.
A1 Capp, Creator 
Of ‘Li’l Abner,’ 
Speaks at Tech
A1 Capp
A1 Capp, nationally known 
humorist and creator of “Li’l 
Abner,” will speak at the 
first assembly program in 
Skibo Ballroom September 
27th at 11:30 a.m.
Subsequent speakers and per­
formers to appear during the as­
sembly hour this fall are Mar­
vin Kalb, Vija Vetra, Senator Jo­
seph Clark, Virgil Thomson, and 
John Jacobs Niles. All Carnegie 
Tech students, faculty and ad­
ministrative people may attend 
these assemblies.
Capp will base his talk on stu­
dent questions (question form on 
page 2). He will speak on any 
topics given him, since, as he de­
scribes himself, he is “a cheer­
fully angry middle-aged man 
with opinions about almost every­
thing.”

Skibo 51
Dean William W. Mullins of 
Engineering and Science is opti­
mistic that the merger could 
skyrocket Carnegie Tech’s E & S 
departments into true national 
prominence. The greatest impact, 
he pointed out, is on the depart­
ments of chemistry, biology, and 
metallurgy, since Mellon will 
add a number of fields of re­
search which Carnegie Tech is 
not actively pursuing.
Mullins added that the idea 
of a merger has become increas­
ingly attractive to Mellon in re­
cent years since many private in­
dustries which formerly support­
ed Mellon research have now es­
tablished their own research and 
development installations. As a 
result, Mellon has placed more 
emphasis on basic research, al­
though applied research and de­
velopment are still well repre­
sented.
Dr. Robert B. Carlin, Becker 
Professor and Head of the De­
partment of Chemistry, points 
out that a near-doubling of the 
chemistry department will result. 
While the undergraduate pro­
gram cannot be expanded a great 
deal due to the necessity of cer­
tain basic courses, the options, 
senior electives, and graduate op­
portunities can be significantly 
expanded, Carlin said. He also 
indicated that Mellon and Car­
negie Tech have been moving 
closer togethec for some time, 
through such means as joint sem­
inars and joint appointments for 
mutual professional development. 
For example, Dr. John A. Pople 
carries on theoretical work both 
as Professor of Chemistry at Car­
negie Tech and as Adjunct Senior 
Fellow at Mellon.
CFA Secure
Dean Norman L. Rice of the 
College of Fine Arts (CFA) stat­
ed that CFA is in no danger of 
losing importance in the change 
from Carnegie Tech to Carnegie 
University. The unique relation­
ship of CFA to the rest of the 
university, he said, would assure 
that there will be no loss of “aca-

Youth More Frank
Mrs. Craig attended Carnegie 
Tech as a business student but 
did not live in the dormitory. Five 
years ago she came to work as 
an assistant to the resident at 
Forbes dormitory (recently de­
molished to make way for Ad­
ministration Hall). Interested par­
ticularly in athletics and music 
she admires today’s young peo­
ple. “They are fundamentally the 
same but much more frank—not 
for the worse,” she observes.
Mrs. Cochran was employed as 
a bank clerk in downtown Pitts­
burgh before she came to More- 
wood Gardens in June 1965. A 
former business student in Waynes- 
burg College she has “always 
worked with young people in com­
munity organizations.” Pursuing 
her hobby, the study of church 
architecture, she makes many 
trips throughout the United 
States.
Mrs. Sutton, who has been at 
Carnegie Tech for two years, 
spent the previous five years in a 
similar capacity a Ohio State 
nursing dormitories. A graduate 
of Beaver College’s business edu­
cation program, she also had been 
employed as a private secretary 
and resident assistant at the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh. Her special 
interests are reading and attend­
ing the theater although she says, 
“I don’t get time to do them 
much.”
Appointed in May
Miss Gail Kruman will serve 
as assistant dean of women and 
resident counselor. “We are rea­
ligning responsibilities, not replac- 
ing a resident head,” said Vir-
Resident Recalls Changes 
In Morewood Character
by Sue Attinson
With the Dean of Women at the head, Morewood Gar­
dens staff members led a nightly procession into the dining 
room. A head waiter seated the 400 or so women and dinner 
was served family style, the staff members acting as table 
hostesses.
Thus, Marian K. Wilson re­
calls her early days as a dormi­
tory resident assistant. 21 years 
ago Dorm Council wore caps and 
gowns causing the residents plead­
ing their cases to “simply quake 
from head to foot.” There was 
much more noise on fraternity 
row then (before the employment 
of Security). And curfews were 
restrictive: freshmen 9 pm, sopho­
mores 10 pm, seniors 11 pm with 
12:30 specials.
Today, Mrs. Wilson, along with 
three other resident assistants 
and an assistant dean of women, 
is responsible for all of the ap­
proximately 800 residents of More­
wood Gardens and Colonial Man­
or apartments. Hours at the desk 
are divided equally among four 
residents and each is in charge of 
room checks in her tower: Louise 
Cochran, D and Colonial Manor;
Joan Smith Craig, E; Mildred 
Sutton, B; and Marion Wilson, C.
They have one day off per week, a 
weekend free per month.
ginia B. Milligan, dean of wom­
en, with regard to Miss Kruman’s 
May appoinment.
The assistant dean will repre­
sent the Dean of Women’s Office 
at the Association of Women Stu­
dents (AWS), Panhellenic Coun­
cil and honoraries. She will work 
particularly with the student floor 
counselors, but will be available 
to all residents of Morewood Gar­
dens to discuss their needs.
A cum laude graduate of the 
University of Pittsburgh, Miss 
Kruman holds master’s degrees 
in physical education and coun­
seling. On the New York Uni­
versity staff during the summers, 
she taught physical education for 
three years at Allegheny High 
School where she was advisor to 
girls. Her other interests include 
tennis, skiiing and the violin.
With regard to Carnegie Tech’s 
orientation program she said: “As 
a freshman I enjoyed freshman 
camp. It was a opportunity great 
opportunity to meet freshman and 
upperclassmen. ’ ’
Flute Recital
Bernard Z. Goldberg, president 
of the Pittsburgh Flute Club, will 
play a Duquesne University fa­
culty concert on October 9 at 8:30 
pm in the recital hall of the 
School of Music at Locust and 
Magee streets on the Bluff. There 
is no admission charge.
Kenneth Bruscia, also a member 
of Duquesne faculty, will supply 
the piano accompaniment to the 
program which will include a 
“Sonatine” by Claude Arrieu, 
“Sonata” by Francis Poulenc, 
and other pieces by French mas­
ters.
Mr. Goldberg is principal flute 
with the Pittsburgh Symphony 
and assistant conductor of the 
Pittsburgh Youth Symphony.

Rothfus Wins 
Excellence Prize 
For Teaching
Robert R. Rothfus, profes­
sor of chemical engineering 
at Carnegie Tech, has been 
presented the sixth annual 
William H. and Frances S. 
Ryan Award for Meritorious 
Teaching. H. Guyford Stev- 
er, Carnegie Tech President, 
made the presentation last 
Wednesday at the opening 
faculty meeting.
Dr. Rothfus is the sixth reci­
pient of the annual award estab­
lished by a $10,000 gift from Mr. 
and Mrs. Ryan of Sacramento, 
California. Mr. Ryan received his 
bachelor’s degree in mechanical 
engineering from Carnegie Tech 
in 1924.
The award takes the form of 
a certificate and honorarium 
and is given each year for 
“excellence of teaching” to a 
faculty member in the under­
graduate divisions.
An alumnus of Carnegie Tech, 
Professor Rothfus earned his 
master’s degree in 1942 and his 
doctorate in 1948. He received 
his undergraduate degree from 
the University of Rochester in 
1941.
In addition to his association 
with the Atomic Energy Commis­
sion research projects since 1956, 
he has been particularly inter­
ested in fluid mechanics, heat 
transfer and mass transfer, and 
process dynamics and control.
Since he joined the Carnegie 
Tech faculty in 1947, he has 
served on a number of commit­
tees such as discipline, library, 
nuclear science, and radiation 
hazards. He is also a former 
chairman of the Engineering and 
Science faculty and former fac­
ulty marshal.
Dr. Rothfus’ professional affili­
ations include the American In­
stitute of Chemical Engineers, the 
American Chemical Society, the 
American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers, and the American So­
ciety for Engineering Education.

Unlike most lecturers Mr. Capp has not set topic but will speak 
on topics that interest the student body. Here is your chance to hear 
about something which interests YOU. Fill in your questions now 
and leave them at the Skibo Information desk. The most interesting 
topics will be discussed. A1 Capp says he is an expert on nothing, 
but has opinions on everything. What is your question?
Contemporary Commentary
by Linda Pecaites
With mid-term gubernatorial and 
congressional elections approach­
ing, politicians begin to measure 
up the battleground for presiden­
tial of 1968. While the Democratic 
oligarchy remains static, Repub­
licans are faced by a montage of 
merging faces, each slightly over- 
lapping and none distinct enough 
® to remain outstanding for any 
meaningful length of time.
None of the new young Repub­
licans have developed an appre­
ciable style of their own, none 
have the wily cleverness of a 
battle-scarred veteran or the fa­
cile, intellectual brilliance to plant 
their standard surmounting all 
£ others.
Numerically the GOP possess­
es an unusually fine stable, but 
few of them have been tested on 
a good, fast track. Their lack of 
training and grooming may off­
set any natural talent.
Mark Hatfield of Oregon is a 
striking proponent of the new 
Republicanism. He has the attri- 
4 butes of the Kennedy charm and
has accumulated an enormously 
impressive record during his gov- 
ernship but fails to stand out as 
a serious threat to any Democratic 
entrenchment not because of lack 
of experience but more because 
of lack of exposure.
A moderate Republican is 
placed in the unenviable posi­
tion of being such a hybrid as to 
blend as easily as a chameleon in 
ranks of the moderate Democrats. 
A lack of distinction in dogma 
necessitates a brilliancy in tactics 
that is severely lacking. Bobby 
Kennedy is an excellent case in 
point. The only distinguishing 
factor of his politics is his ruth­
lessness and yet he has managed 
through a magnificant magnetism 
to establish a powerful coterie of 
followers.
Among the Republicans there 
appears to be something of a 
gentleman’s agreement to not real­
ly try very hard to establish any 
primacy. They give the impres­
sion of schoolboys standing in awe

demic integrity.”
While few CFA students be­
come involved in scientific ac­
tivities to such an extent that 
Mellon’s addition could direct­
ly benefit them, Rice feels that 
on the whole CFA will gain 
several advantages from the 
merger. Courses such as Art 
and Music History, for ex­
ample could be taught by the 
new College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences, thus allowing 
CFA to concentrate more close­
ly on the professional part of 
Carnegie Tech’s goal of liberal 
professional education.
Rice added that CFA has al­
ways been dominated by num­
bers, and he expects no change. 
But the problems of CFA will by 
no means worsen, he said.
Commenting on the univer­
sity proposal, Carnegie Tech 
president H. Guyford Stever, 
viewed the creation of a univer­
sity from Carnegie Tech and 
Mellon Institute as “adding two 
to get six.” The extra two re­
fers to the proposed College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences.
While the creation of a co­
educational degree-granting Col 
lege of H&SS will certainly 
increase the prestige of its de­
partments, work previously done 
by these departments has already 
gained them national recognition, 
according to Dean Erwin R. Stein­
berg of Margaret Morrison Car­
negie College.
Carnegie monographs in Eng­
lish and history, as well as out­
standing work in high school cur­
ricula and teach education, can 
now be continued in greater 
depth with the consolidation of 
the departments into the College

H & SS Opportunity
Steinberg emphasized the un­
common opportunity presented to 
the planned College of H & SS. It 
has an established faculty and 
financial basis with practically 
no obligations or commitments 
to fight in setting up the new col­
lege. Thus Steinberg pointed out, 
the College of H & SS can start 
out fullblown with a modem, 
smoothly-operating curriculum.
MMCC will continue to offer 
liberal professional education 
for women, Steinberg said. 
However, no plans have yet 
been made as to which specific 
functions and courses will be 
housed in the various colleges.
Dr. Hugh D. Young, Head of 
Natural Sciences in MMCC points 
out that MMCC may head more 
towards educations studies, since 
many of the courses needed for 
MMCC women will be taught in 
other colleges. He indicated the 
possibility of creation of an Edu­
cational Institute to house cur­
rent educational research i n 
MMCC.
Dean of Student Affairs George 
K. Brown summed up the future 
in several general statements ab­
out Carnegie University. Brown 
pointed out that the physical 
plant as well as the financial as­
pects of Carnegie Tech will
change, and stated that “the ef­
fects will be essentially that of a 
snowball.”
“The growth and extension of 
the present plant at Carnegie 
Tech will in turn attract more 
professors to the undergraduate 
and graduate levels of higher 
education ” Brown added.
Yet it is not expected that 
student enrollment will in­
crease to a large extent in the 
near future. Commenting on 
the proposed College of Hu­
manities and Social Sciences, 
Brown said “The new college 
will emphasize the teaching of 
students.”

Inadequate Facility
As a university expands, the student services, as in­
tegral parts of the university community, must expand with 
it. This enlargement is not only one of increased enrollment, 
but also involves meeting the demand created by greater 
diversity. Two of these student services, often cited as 
inefficient and inadequate, have long created problems for 
the Tech student. One of these, the food service, has taken 
steps to remedy some of its inadequacies. Although initial 
results and reactions have shown that possibly these steps 
are not enough to alleviate the problems, perhaps the even­
tual end result will prove more desirable. Certainly, provid­
ing student employment opportunities has been a step in the 
right direction. In addition, students are placed in positions 
responsible for the service, and hence can evaluate it. All 
that remains is improving the food!
Perhaps as important, if not more so, is the service 
provided by a bookstore. Long heralded as epitomes of 
campus stores, the Coops of Harvard and MIT sell every­
thing from furniture and clothing to books covering any- 
from aardvarks to zymurgy. Although such a store would 
be a desirable addition to any university, Tech's urban 
location reduces the necessity for such a broad spectrum 
of goods. Nevertheless, if one has frequented the book­
store during the past week, he will quickly realize that 
there is a great need for expansion of the presently exist­
ing facilities.
The existing bookstore layout is not the most efficient, 
gspecially in that it utilizes only two cashiers. Again this 
problem was emphasized this past week in the semi-annual 
rush as students bought books and supplies for the coming 
semester.
The administration is aware of the problem, and accord­
ing to Dr. Robert Kibbee, vice-president for planning, the 
bookstore will inherit the space now occupied by the post 
office and an existing storage area. When asked about 
future plans for the bookstore, Kibbee replied that if and 
when an addition to Skibo is made, the bookstore’s needs will 
be considered.
For now, it appears that the bookstore is destined to 
remain in its present location. All existing dead space, 
including offices for the personnel, and storage areas, 
should be utilized as bookstore display area (including the 
post office area). The offices and storage space could be 
moved elsewhere in Baker Hall, into space vacated by 
administrative offices. Secondly, more cashier pests 
should be established, with at least three extra cashiers 
on a temporary basis during the beginning of each semes­
ter. In addition, bookstore hours should be revised to en­
able students to purchase items before early classes, or 
after night classes, at least during the pre-semester rush.
Although the addition of the extra space to the book­
store area will increase its size by one-third, this will still 
not be enough for it to cope adequately with its problems. 
Due to the varied nature of Tech’s curriculum, the book­
store must carry not only all textbooks and required mat­
ter, but should carry a wide range of books in related 
fields. In addition, it must sell art and architecture sup­
plies. Finally, a large selection of fiction, non-technical, 
and other books should be stocked.
Currently, the bookstore fails to meet these require­
ments, carrying only the bare essentials needed for course 
work, and only a scant amount of extra-curricular reading 
material. Supplementary materials, such as paper, desk 
lamps, pens, and other items are supplied only in limited 
quantities. In fact, several such items were sold out three 
days after classes began.
It is understood that such broadened inventory would 
be impossible with the now existing facilities. Also, the 
inadequacies discussed above concern only the sale of books 
and related items. Other student needs should be met, such 
as personal items, prescription drugs, sundries, etc., which 
now can be purchased only at exorbitant prices at a nearby 
drug store.
Perhaps a solution to both problems could be reached 
with an entirely new concept for the bookstore.
Tech now owns, but does not operate, the Woodlawn 
Pharmacy building. If Tech were to assume operation of 
this establishment, on the same cost basis as the bookstoi e, 
this would constitute the ‘other half’ of a more complete 
campus store. By revising the hours of operation of the 
snack bar, the food counter in the drug store could be abol­
ished. Further, by dividing the inventories between the two 
locations, more needed space could be gained for both. The 
bookstore would sell only books, paper, art supplies, and 
other such necessities, while the drug store could sell sweat­
shirts, personal items, candy, and prescription drugs. Al­
though this location is not centralized on campus, such an 
establishment, open seven days a week, and selling these 
goods on an ‘at cost’ basis, would certainly improve this 
student service while utilizing already existing space.
When the concept of Carnegie University becomes a 
reality, the problems of space and diversity of services will 
become paramount, for even greater demands will be made 
on the bookstore’s facilities. Rather than delaying the pro­
cess of finding a solution to these problems, Tech should 
begin to alleviate them now.

Tartan Interview
This
is Al Julius
by Jeff Evans
Tartan Photo by John Mera 
Al Julius is the News Director of radio station KQV. He gives 
news reports throughout the day with a commentary at 5:55 p.m. 
He has a Sunday evening show, “Controversy” on which he 
accepts phone calls from interested Pittsburghers, and a new 
Sunday night show, “Pinpoint.” He is a 1951 graduate of the 
Carnegie Tech Drama Department.
On our way downtown, the 
staff photographer and I, in dis­
cussing our forthcoming inter­
view, reflected a common skepti­
cism toward the man named Al 
Julius. Images of dogmatism and 
elderly pomposity were soon for­
gotten, however, in the subdued 
reception room of KQV. A man 
in his middle thirties soon ap­
peared surrounded by what ap­
peared to be 900 screaming high 
school girls. After all autographs 
were signed and the studio clear­
ed, we were led down a long 
cinderblock hallway past clatter­
ing teletypes to the closet-sized 
office of the News Director.
Men should be “drafted right 
out of high school,” commented 
Mr. Julius. That way, they have 
a chance to grow up and know 
exactly what they want out of 
an education. Al Julius, as a mem­
ber of the Carnegie Tech Drama 
Department class of 1951, had 
been to war in Europe. To this 
man who loves the theater there 
is a great deal of sentiment as­
sociated with the profession that 
causes many actors to remain 
apart and to constantly live in 
what some call a make-believe 
world. He said, however, that in 
his time they were not “culty” or 
“anti” anything for its own sake 
as some artists today are accused 
of being. Rather, they felt a 
great need to break away from 
the enforced discipline of their 
recent experience; they looked 
like bums because they had no 
money to look any better. He 
feels that his class, being older, 
truly enjoyed acting. “Today,” he 
said “(drama students) try to 
figure out why they enjoy act­
ing.”
Unknowing people then and 
now find it easy to label the 
dramats “crazy,” for they seem 
never to stop acting, but Mr. Juli­
us pointed out that when an engi­
neer, for example, leaves school 
he is sure to find a job, the qual­
ity of which is proportional to 
the degree attained. In drama, 
however, actors especially have 
the cards stacked against them, 
and a doctorate means nothing 
except in teaching. To that great 
percentage of students that will 
never make it, their only time 
to act is now, continually, for 
their love will never be fulfilled. 
Fear from feeling pity for his 
young collegues, however, he 
rather sees their broad experi­
ence as being far more personally 
fulfilling though perhaps in a
v/ay superficial, than the narrow 
interests of many of those in the 
other professions.
After graduation, Mr. Julius 
acted for six years in the Nation­
al Theater in Israel, where, he 
said, “actors are people,” and 
are not separated from other pro­
fessionals as in this country. On 
his return to the States he work­
ed in Denver and then returned 
to Pittsburgh in 1964 to assume 
his present position at KQV.
I asked Mr. Julius why he 
turned to radio. His comment was 
that though he is reasonably 
sure that he will never be im­
mortal, he feels that he is doing 
a more interesting and important 
job by speaking his own words 
rather than those that have been 
written before. He feels that he 
is no longer an actor, but when 
questioned on his interpretation 
of commentary, he said that his 
style is definitely a product of his 
training at Tech. To him, the 
news, being made up of people, 
places, and events, is as much 
drama as the imitations of life 
depicted on the stage. His use 
notably of the dramatic pause, 
functions to make his audience 
think, to make them take a part 
in and be more aware of the 
news. And apparently he is reach­
ing people . . . even high school 
girls.
WRCT Sets 
’66 Schedule
by Peter Weinberg
WRCT, the campus radio sta­
tion, has announced scheduling of 
several new shows for the 1966- 
67 season. “Cineposium” will pre­
sent weekly discussions based on 
cinema activity in the campus 
area. The permanent panel con­
sists of Dr. James L. Rosenberg, 
Mr. Akrim Madoni (Drama Dept.), 
and Mr. Eugene McCreary, (His­
tory Dept., all of whom are en­
gaged in or planning campus-wide 
cinema courses. Both faculty and 
students will participate as guest 
panelists every Friday evening at 
7:30. This week the discussion 
will center on Ingmar Bergman’s 
“Through a Glass Darkly.” In 
weeks to come attention will be 
focused on other Film Arts pre­
sentations.
Another new show premiering 
this semester is “Community 
Spotlight,” a Monday night pre­
sentation of cultural events in 
and around the campus.
David Greene and his faithful 
sidekick George return to the mi­
crophones with folk music, hu­
mor, and surprises every Tuesday 
at 8 pm.
Sunday Repertory Theater, Sun­
day at 3 pm brings listeners the 
recorded and original contem- 
pory and classical texts. This 
Sunday the show features “Four 
Stories of Shalom Alechem” star­
ring Arthur Rosenberg and spe­
cial guest Dr. Lewis Palter, for­
mer Drama Department faculty 
member. On the same show, fol­
lowing this original WRCT pro­
duction will be “Point of Order,” 
a documentary in dramatic form 
of the Army-McCarthy harings.
This Thursday at 8 pm, “Coun­
terpoint 66” presents three rep­
resentatives of cultural activity in 
Pittsburgh: Mark Lewis of the 
Playhouse, Dr. W. Van Grosch- 
witz of the Carnegie Institute Mu­
seum, and Peter Weinberg, rep­
resenting the Pittsburgh Sym­
phony.
In addition to these feature 
programs there will be weeknight- 
ly jazz sessions at 10 pm and se­
ven and one half hours of classi­
cal music weekly.

Distinguished Histories Add 
In Plan for New Universities
With the announcement of the proposed Carnegie Uni­
versity last Wednesday, the consolidation of two distin­
guished Pittsburgh institutions appears forthcoming. Mellon 
Institute has pioneered in scientific and community endeav­
ors since its inception in 1906 by Dr. Robert Kennedy Dun­
can, and Carnegie Tech has been a leader in higher educa­
tion in a wide variety of professional fields.
Proposed Merger Creates 
Six University Divisions
The union of Carnegie Tech with Mellon Institute, as proposed last Wednesday, will 
result in a private university, limited in size and enrollment. While officials have empha­
sized that at the moment this merger is merely a proposal, considerable planning has been 
done and the future directions of Carnegie University are fairly well indicated in many 
areas. ____________________________________________
Mellon Institute developed from 
Duncan’s idea that the resources 
and methods of physical science 
could be applied to the problems 
of industry. Duncan conceived 
that this relationship could be 
handled through an industry- 
sponsored Fellowship system of 
research programs to study spe­
cific problems. The plan appealed 
to A. W. Mellon and R. B. Mellon, 
who invited Duncan to establish 
this system in Pittsburgh as the 
Mellon Institute of Industrial Re­
search and School of Specific In­
dustries as part of the University 
of Pittsburgh. In 1927, the Insti­
tute separated from the Universi­
ty and has, since that date, op- 
perated independently under its 
own charter and management, al­
though it still maintains a close 
cooperation with this organiza­
tion. One of the most noteworthy 
and outstanding gifts of the 
Founders was the present Mellon 
Institute building in Oakland, de­
signed in the classic Greek style 
with majestic columns and im­
pressive lines but efficiently 
housing eight stories of modern 
laboratories, offices, shops, and 
lecture rooms.
Mellon Institute Is a non­
profit organization whose cost­
ly research is borne by con­
tributions from individual 
companies which sponsor the 
research. Over 650 processes 
and products have evolved 
from Mellon work, and several 
have inspired the creation of 
new industries such as Viking 
Corporation, Plaskon Company, 
Inc., and the Dow-Coming- Cor­
poration. Several industrial re­
search centers, such as that of 
Gulf Oil, began as fellowships 
at Mellon.
Parallel with the development 
of science and technology at the 
Institute has been the training 
of scientific minds in the prob­
lems of technology. As these 
trained people moved on into 
other opportunities in industry, 
education, and government, they 
have contributed to the impor­
tant marjriage of science and in­
dustry which currently domin­
ates our economy.
Joint Projects 
Some 3,000 scientific people 
have increased their research 
skills by spending a few years at 
Mellon Institute, and in many in­
stances completed advanced aca­
demic degrees while pursuing 
their specific research project. 
Many of this alumni group now 
hold important positions in in­
dustry, education, and govern­
ment. Also, many Institute sci­
entists have held appointments 
at both the University of Pitts­
burgh and Carnegie Institute of 
Technology.
As the Institute grew, the 
founder’s families established 
policies which increased the 
emphasis on fundamental re­
search. In 1957, these policies 
culminated in the Fundamental 
Research Trust created by the 
Mellon and Scaife families. 
Since this decision, fundamen­
tal research at the Institute has 
grown rapidly and now consti­
tutes nearly 50 per cent of the 
total research effort with support 
from industry, government, and 
the endowment funds. This pro­
gram is conducted by a small 
staff of scientists of established 
competence in various scientific 
disciplines who provide a contin­
uity for over 50 young scientists 
to advance in experience and 
self-confidence through work 
on projects selected solely for 
scientific merit. The tenure of 
these postdoctoral Institute Fel­
lows ranges from one to six 
years. The record of this program
The stated objectives of Car­
negie University are two-fold:
1. the establishment of a pri­
vate university in this area of 
the United States of recognized 
excellence;
2. to offer in this University 
strong graduate programs in the 
several professional schools, to 
contribute and improve the ex­
isting undergraduate programs 
in engineering, management, the 
fine arts, and in several areas 
of women’s education; to inau­
gurate a new undergraduate de­
gree program in humanities and 
social sciences which will com­
bine a strong liberal education 
with a professional focus; to 
serve the industrial and educa­
tional community of ¿he region 
through advanced part-time 
education at the post-graduate 
level, offering both advanced de­
gree programs and special cours­
es.
The new university will have six 
degree-granting divisions: The
Mellon Institute of Science, the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
the College of Humanities and So­
cial Sciences, Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College, the Carnegie 
College of Fine Arts, and the 
Graduate School of Industrial Ad­
ministration, W. L. Mellon, found­
er.
Thus the net result of the crea­
tion of Carnegie University would 
be to place in the city of Pitts­
burgh a new private university 
that would be the leader in this 
region with the potential of be­
coming one of the front-ranking
The announcement of the 
projected merger of Car­
negie Institute of Technol- 
oly with Mellon Institute to 
form Carnegie University 
came simultaneously at three 
meetings on campus.
R. D. Strathmeyer, Vice-Presi­
dent for Business Affairs, made 
the announcement to the staff in 
a meeting in Skibo Ballroom at 
3:30 pm last Wednesday, while 
George K. Brown, Dean of Stu­
dent Affairs, made the project 
known to the student body in 
the Wherett Room in Skibo. Car­
negie Tech President H. Guyford 
Stever had made the announce­
ment to the general faculty at a 
meeting in Carnegie Theater a 
short time earlier.
Dean Brown in his announce­
ment to the students expressed 
the feeling that no appreciable 
change in the tuition rates
universities in the United States.
Mutual Benefits
The proposed new university 
would take advantage of the fine 
name and quality of each party, 
to insure that personnel are pro­
vided even better environments 
in which to pursue careers, to 
make maximum use of the phy- 
cical facilities and monetary as­
sets of both, and to end with a 
more efficient organization.
Currently there are approxi­
mately 490 permanent employees 
working at the Mellon Institute, 
roughly one-third of whom are 
professionals, with the remaining 
two-thirds serving in a supportive 
capacity as secretaries, techni­
cians and custodians.
Under the terms of the proposal, 
personnel of the two institutions 
would receive appointments at the 
new university. Carnegie Tech 
faculty and administration would 
retain the positions they now 
hold. Senior research fellows at 
the Mellon Institute will become 
faculty members of appropriate 
rank and department, and junior 
fellows and postdoctoral fellows 
will become either junior faculty 
members or continue their full­
time research appointments. The 
administrative staff at Mellon In­
stitute will be given similar posts 
in the new university.
Since the creation of a new uni­
versity can only result in increas­
ed activity — research operations 
must be serviced, buildings and 
equipment must be maintained, 
and cleraical and secretarial du­
ties performed — all supporting
would occur. He added that the 
merger idea had been under 
consideration for the last four 
to six months.
Among the possible changes 
that will be made to house the 
new university will be the erec­
tion of an academic complex op­
posite the U.S. Bureau of Mines 
on Forbes Avenue. There is no 
anticipated change in undergrad­
uate enrollment; however, grad­
uate studies would expand under 
the influence of Mellon’s techni­
cal excellence.
It is anticipated that the uni­
versity plan may be in effect 
by fall of 1967.
The importance of the an­
nouncement was signified by the 
fact that three public relations 
representatives from Carnegie 
Tech flew to New York City, 
home base of the Carnegie Cor­
poration to make the announce* 
ment there while the plan was 
being unfolded in Pittsburgh.
professional staff members of both 
institutions will continue to serve 
the new university.
Mellon Institute, which will 
become the Mellon Institute of 
Science of Carnegie University, 
will carry on its research pro­
grams through the departments 
of chemistry, physics, biology, 
and earth and astronomical sci­
ences. The Nuclear Research 
Center at Saxonburg, now opera­
ted by Carnegie Tech, and Mel­
lon’s Radiation and Chemical 
Hygiene laboratories at Bushby 
Run will also continue as part 
of Mellon Institute of Science.
Mellon seminars, teacher edu­
cation programs, and other train­
ing programs will continue in 
the new Institute of Science along 
with present Carnegie Tech pro­
grams.
Thus the proposed creation of 
the Mellon Institute of Science 
of Carnegie University brings to­
gether scientists and facilities of 
one of this country’s leading cen­
ters of basic research and of an 
educational institution which for 
many years has been recognized 
as a leader in scientific education 
and research. The resulting com­
bination would produce a center 
of scientific study challnging any 
in the United States.
Engineering School
Carnegie Tech’s present engin­
eering, mathematics, and com­
puter science departments will 
become Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology of Carnegie University. In 
addition, a new unit, the center 
for advanced technology, would 
include a laboratory of applied 
research as well as presently ex­
isting interdisciplinary programs 
in applied space sciences, applied 
materials science, and applied nu­
clear science. The work planned 
in the center of advanced techno­
logy would be primarily problem- 
oriented rather than discipline- 
oriented, and would include re­
search in advanced technology, as 
well as in the technicians of ad­
vanced technology.
The new center would also 
provide a facility in which the 
industrial fellowships and in­
dustrial contracts of the present 
Mellon Institute will be continu­
ed with research personnel from 
the Institute. It is expected that 
a graduate program will be es­
tablished in the center.
For almost 30 years, Carnegie 
Tech’s present division of human­
ities and social sciences, a non­
degree granting division servicing 
all other colleges on campus, has 
played an important role in the 
development of the university’s 
Carnegie Plan of Liberal-Profes­
sional Education.
The newly established College 
Of Humanities and Social Sciences 
would consist initially of the six 
departments in operation present­
ly (economics, psychology, Eng­
lish, modern languages, and na­
tural sciences), and would offer 
a new Bachelor of Arts degree 
program for men. The college will 
also offer service courses for the 
undergraduate professional schools 
of technology science, and fine 
arts.
It is anticipated that other pro­
grams and departments will be

Chemical Society announces the 
installation of its new officers for 
the coming academic year: 
President: George Havach s. j. 
Vice-President: Jeff Evans 
Sec’y-treas: Edward McGovern 
The club is under the advisor- 
ship of Prof. Anthony Streiff, the 
chemistry department’s new as­
sistant head.
Plans are to use the first meet­
ings of the society for the purpose 
of introducing interested students 
to faculty, society members, and 
to the chemistry department in 
general.
Interested students, freshmen 
included, are invited to attend 
the first meeting which is to be 
announced.
Commentary
of the headmaster deceiving them­
selves that since he holds the 
whip, they will never hold the 
whip themselves.
Defeatism is the only rallying 
cry that the GOP has been able 
to muster, which does nothing 
to brighten the image of any 
young hopeful. This lack of na­
tional unity and sporadic image 
building and the absolute gulf 
between the old guard and the 
new create an almost impossible 
atmosphere in which to field a 
strong national candidate.
The most politically attractive 
of the potential leaders have the 
misfortune to sit in local power, 
such as Romney, Percy, or Lind­
sey, which isolates them from na­
tional issues as much the average 
monastery would. If no one bes­
tirs himself the Republicans may 
just be left with Richard Nixon 
the only person campaigning for 
the nomination.

Histories
(Continued from Page 5) 
is attested by the many signifi­
cant contributions which have 
been made in scientific publica­
tions in biological and biophysi­
cal chemistry, inorganic chemis­
try, physical and theoretical 
chemistry, radiation chemistry, 
physics and chemistry of macro­
molecules, rheology, continum 
physics, solid state physics, phys­
ics of metals, and metallurgy.
Radiation Research
To permit extensive research 
in radiation chemistry, the In­
stitute in 1958 opened its Bushy 
Run Laboratories in Westmore­
land County—23 miles east of 
Oakland—where buildings adapt­
ed to radiation research and in­
dustrial toxicology have been 
erected.
The Institute has considered it 
a critical duty to make the re­
sults of its researches available 
through publication in the scien­
tific press, and the contributions 
to this literature have been con­
tinuous since its first program. In 
total during the 53 years of op­
eration, it has contributed some 
60 books, 370 bulletins, 4,000 re­
search papers, 1,600 patients, and 
many miscellaneous articles in 
professional and trade journals.
Mellon Institute has conducted 
a number of research projects of 
direct public interest. Such 
studies usually bear on public 
health and include studies of 
smoke abatement on industrial 
and urban dusts, investigations 
in dental science, studies in nu­
trition, a comprehensive investi­
gation of sleep, and searches for 
new compounds of value in treat­
ing pneumonia and cancer. Out 
of the first investigation on smoke 
abatement, which began in 1911 
and continued for three years, 
came information recognized in­
ternationally in many industrial 
centers.
Throughout its long history 
Mellon Institute has endeavored 
to conduct comprehensive inves­
tigations in the natural sciences 
to train research workers and to 
provide technical information for 
the benefit of the professions, the 
public, and industry. These pur­
poses represent the continuing 
challenge against which the con­
tributions of the Institute must 
be measured.
Carnegie Tech
Carnegie Tech was founded in 
1900 by pioneer steel-maker and 
philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie, 
on ground contributed by the 
City of Pittsburgh. Originally 
founded as the Carnegie Techni­
cal Schools devoted to training
skilled persons for industry, the 
school opened its door in 1905. 
In 1912, the Institutions was 
granted a charter with the pow­
er to confer degrees.
Known as Carnegie Institute 
of Technology from that time, 
the Institute awarded its first 
master’s degree in 1914 and its 
first Ph.D. in 1921. Carnegie 
Tech was the first American 
institution of higher learning 
to award a degree in drama 
(1914), and the first to estab­
lish a department of industrial 
physchology in 1915. Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College (for 
women) came into existence in 
1907.
Carnegie Tech was among the 
first educational institutions in 
the United States to promote the 
concept of liberal professional ed­
ucation, and its Carnegie Plan 
of Education, formulated by late 
President Robert E. Doherty, and 
announced in 1937, was a pio­
neering effort in that area.
Other major educational pro­
grams of national significance 
now in operation at Carnegie 
Tech include several graduate 
programs using the interdisci­
plinary approach, the advanced 
placement program which brings 
college-level work to exceptional 
high school students, and to which 
Carnegie Tech was an early and 
important contributor, and Car­
negie’s Computation Center, one 
of the two or three largest such 
university-related facilities in the 
United States.
Graduate Strength
While always respected for its 
strong undergraduate programs, 
Carnegie Tech has emerged also 
as a center for graduate educa­
tion. In the past few years, it 
has consistently ranked among 
the top five private universities 
in the nation in the number of 
engineering Ph.D. degrees grant­
ed and has granted the largest 
number of such degrees among 
all institutions, whether private 
or publicly supported, in Penn­
sylvania. Also in the past few 
years, the institution has been 
deeply involved with creating 
new educational institutions and 
strengthening existing education­
al programs in India, Pakistan, 
and the Philippines.
Through June, 1966, Carnegie 
Tech conferred more than 24,- 
500 bachelor’s, 4,000 master’s, 
and 1,000 Ph.D. degrees for a to­
tal of almost 30,000 alumni. These 
alumni can be found in all 50 
states and over 500 of the grad­
uates are in various countries 
outside of the United States.

added to this college as future 
educational needs become appar­
ent. Strong graduate programs 
now exist in some of the depart­
ments, and it is expected that 
others will develop quickly.
Carnegie Tech has served as 
the national center for Project 
English and played an important 
role in the development of Pro­
ject Social Studies. In addition, 
several faculty members from 
the new college have been in­
volved deeply in pioneering Ad­
vanced Placement programs for 
potentially bright but non-achiev­
ing high school students. 
Women’s education at Carnegie 
dates back to the time of the Car­
negie Technical Schools. The pre­
sent Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
College was the second structure 
to be completed on the Carnegie 
campus in 1907.
Recent emphasis at the College 
has been on education and re­
search for the changing role of 
women in society. As part of Car­
negie University, the college’s 
function would remain essential­
ly the same, that is, to initiate 
new programs for women both 
at the undergraduate level and 
in the area of continuing educa­
tion, to counsel and advise women 
students on academic matters, and 
to be continually aware of the ra­
pidly changing educational needs 
of women.
The Carnegie College of Fine 
Arts, opened in 1912, can boast, 
among its many accomplish­
ments, of having the oldest and 
one of the most respected de­
partments of drama in the Unit­
ed States.
Currently the College offers de­
gree programs in the departments 
of architecture, drama, graphic 
arts, music, and painting, design 
and sculpture. As one of the six 
degree-granting colleges of the new 
university the College of Fine 
Arts will continue to have as its 
goal the development of a high 
degree of initial professional com­
petence, and at the same time, 
equipping the students to continue 
the learning process after gradu­
ation.
The most recent developments 
in the College have been the es­
tablishment of a Ph.D. program 
in drama and a strong new grad­
uate program in urban design.

GSIA Functions
As part of the newly created 
university, GSIA’s objectives will 
continue to be educating future 
managers in a world of rapid 
change, training tomorrow’s lead­
ers in business education and re­
search, pioneering in research 
which continues to revolutionize 
management practices, and ex­
panding basic knowledge of man­
agement processes.
GSIA will offer master’s and 
doctorate programs in industrial 
administration, economics, statis­
tics, and psychology, and will ad­
minister the two years of under­
graduate programs in industrial 
administration and graphic arts 
management.
In addition to the six degree 
granting divisions, several all­
universities centers and pro­
grams are proposed. Carnegie 
Tech’s well-known computer 
center will continue to serve 
students and community as well 
as research activity. The inter­
disciplinary systems and com­
munications sciences program,
which has been supported 
heavily by the Advanced Re- 
serch Projects Agency of the 
Department of Defense, will con­
tinue its important research, 
and the Office of Post-College 
Professional Education, estab­
lished to combat engineering ob­

fer to the region part-time ad­
vanced degree programs and 
shorter programs designed to 
meet special industrial and sci­
entific needs.

Cross Country Harriers Begin
Pre-Season Training
by Don Bair
What does fall mean to you? Classics, football, parties, work? For a few students it 
means cross-country.
“What is cross-country?” you ask. Well, some crazy people like to run. They run 
up hills, down hills, over people, and through Schenley Park. These people are the CIT 
Cross-Country Team. Every fall they get together and run in groups, as anyone who 
lounges on Flagstaff Hill will tell you. After a few weeks the team seems to have master­
ed Schenley Park (they haven’t been defeat ^d at home in five years) and almost any other
course they run.
Only last season, when they 
lost two away meets, did our 
(CITs) consecutive win streak 
stop at the pitiful total of 42.
About 4:30 every weekday you 
can see one of the Co-Captains, 
Harry Burkholder or Rodger 
Carns (whichever one shows up 
on time) leading the team in some 
“exercises.” In a few minutes the 
team will disappear over the top 
of Flagstaff Hill on a run cover­
ing 4, 6, 10, or 12 miles. You may 
pity us (I‘ve recently joined their 
ranks) if you wish, but you’d be 
surprised if you really knew what 
went on.
The jokes are usually funny, and 
stopping traffic gives everyone a 
great thrill, but it’s running up 
or down a crowded hill that is 
really fun. Just ask the co-cap­
tains who each have three CC 
letters or Assistant Coach George 
Crawford (a Tech grad student) 
why they run. It’s not because 
they like pain.
Tartan Future
The team, coached by former 
Pitt and Olympic Track Coach, 
Carl Olsen, hopes to improve on 
last season’s poor 9-2 record. With 
four of last year’s five lettermen 
returning, a strong team is al­
most assured. The season improve­
ment from upperclassmen Dale 
Peschel and Bernie Flynn, along 
with the promising performances 
of John Butler and several other 
newcomers, has brightened the 
outlook of the season.
The schedule this season de­
prives the team of meeting West­
minster and Waynesburg (the two
teams that defeated us last year) 
on ground unfamiliar tb us. So 
we must look to the Grove City 
Pack and their band-box type of 
CC courses for a real thrill.
Any idiot with or without pre­
vious sysptoms of this rare dis­
ease (running-itis) is welcome to 
join us at 4:30 any weekday. Mike 
Campbell, a transfer student from 
Colorado State, had never run un­
til he came to Tech, but once in­
fected, he set a Tech Cross Coun­
try record.

SAE Captures
All-Sports Trophy
SAE captured the all-sports tro­
phy for the 65-66 intramural sea­
son by winning the softball cham­
pionship game against TDP. This 
gave SAE 57 intramural points, 
the most any team has had since 
the Grad Eagles were split up, 
and a 13 point lead over their 
nearest rival. SAE’s champion­
ship team was led by MVP Har­
vey Gammon and All-school team 
members Ed Kilpela, Ray Laufer, 
Terry Chenowth, and Lou Maligia.
Fve different teams led the in­
tramural contest during the year, 
with BTP and ATO as close con­
tenders until SAE won the soft­
ball championship. SAE teams 
won four other school champion­
ships in different sports and were 
managed by Ed Kilpela, junior, 
mechanical engineering.
Sports Bulletin

Tartan Sports Editor
With the advent of the ’66-67 season, the prediction man cannot
help but look forward to what could be the most successful sports 
year in recent Carnegie Tech history. This will, of course, take much 
doing to top last year’s overall record of 55-1-37. The reason that 
I am willing to predict an even better season is that last year’s strong 
teams should continue to be strong while the weak teams are in 
sxcellent position to have successful seasons.
The football team, which has won only five games in the last 
five years, lost only two seniors last year and, therefore, has the ex­
perience that is essential for a winning team. Also, the crew of eager 
freshmen should provide the essential depth and back-up strength 
that they have sorely needed in past seasons.
The basketball team will, of course, be deeply hurt by the loss 
of two of its big guns, Ray Morrisson and James Brown, but should 
still have the talent to have another great season. Finally, the cross­
country team, the most successful team at Tech, can look forward to 
another banner season even though they have lost one of their main­
stays in Chris Macosko.
*****
At this time, my predictions that the Pirates and Orioles would 
win the pennants don’t appear to be doing too badly, but I fear that 
the Pirate pitching may not be enough to get them back into first 
place.
*****
Much as I would like to pick the Steelers to win the title, I’m 
afraid that I must pick them as no better than a third place team. 
Look for a repeat of last year’s season with Green Bay and Cleveland 
in the Championship, but not without a lot of trouble with Balti­
more and Dallas.
*****
At this time, I would like to offer my condolences to all those 
people who are Pitt Panther fans. With the team Pitt has and the 
schedule they play, they’ll be lucky to win a game this year. 
*****
As you probably know, the Tartans open the football season this 
Saturday at home against Wooster. Game time is 1:30 pm at Tech 
field. Let’s all wish Coach Gasparella and the Tartans the best of 
luck this season and be out there to cheer them on to an opening 
day victory.
WARA Gets Set 
For Swimming
On Monday the WARA swim­
ming team began its 1966 season. 
The team practices in the Tech 
pool on Monday and Thursday 
nights from 6 to 8 o’clock. The 
team manager and captain, Mary 
Kingsley, is looking forward to a 
successful season since many 
freshmen have been added to the 
team. Last year’s main problem 
was insufficient numbers of girls 
on the team, which forced some 
of the better swimmers to enter 
in at least three events and not 
be able to put forth a total effort 
in any event.
A home swim meet with Pitt 
is scheduled for October 22 with 
a return meet set for November 
19. Since a great deal of interest 
has been shown in an intramural 
meet, this event has been sched­
uled for October 18. All interested 
girls are asked to contract Mary 
Kingsley for further information.
Liese Hess, field hockey man­
ager, has informed us that team 
practice will begin on September 
27 at 4:30 on the football field. 
All ne\y and old members are 
urged to come.
