On' March 7 at 8;15 the Cosmo­
politan club meets in Recreation 
hall of Margaret Morrison. Carnegie 
students, whether or not they are 
members, are urged to come to 
enjoy the novel program and the 
social period following. The “big 
four” of Pittsburgh’s institutions 
for higher learning are represented 
in the Cosmopolitan club but Car­
negie, the largest of the schools 
concerned, is probably the least .in­
terested of the group.
Contrary to popular belief, there 
are no restrictions against Amer­
ican students or professors enter­
ing this organization. The mem­
bership charge i? $.1 a ¡jcuiester; a 
fee of 25 cents per person is asked 
of those attending who arc not 
enrolled in the club. Splendid pro- 
. grams of dance, song, or musical 
• entertainment representing a ccr- 
lain section of Europe or some 
other continent feature the meet­
ings; prominent educators arc se­
cured as speakers. Refreshments 
and a social hour conclude these 
meetings which arc held monthly 
either at Heinz house, P. C. W., or 
at Margaret Morrison. Frequent 
dunces, and dinners arc also given 
during the year.
Tck Chand, Industries, of Scobell 
hall is chairman of the member­
ship committee. Mr. Chand is 
from India and for the past two 
years has been an interested mem­
ber of the Cosmopolitan club. He 
states that the only anti-American 
restriction of the club is perhaps 
tjiat parr of the constitution which 
states that two-thirds of the offices 
are to be filled by foreign students. 
Prof. W. Dawes of the history de­
partment at Tech is a patron oi 
the group; Mys. R. C. Mitchell of 
Pitt is .at the head of the foreign 
students oi Pittsburgh.
A nominating committee for next 
year’s cabinet officers will be ap­
pointed at the Y. W. C. A. Cab­
inet meeting to be held this noon 
at 12:30 in the Women's Dining 
Rboin. The Committee will consist 
of three' members, and it will be 
its duty to recommend several 
members of the cabinet for offices 
next year, and present the recom­
mendations to the cabinet at one 
of the future meetings.
Election of officers for the Cab­
inet is held -by .special post card 
ballot, a copy of which is sent to 
each member of the ,Y. M. C. A. 
The officers, as well as the cabinet 
members' for next year, take their 
oath of office at the installation 
banquet held in . the spring. The 
banquet .is usually formal, and is 
attended by''the cabinet members, 
including members from the soph­
omore and freshman cabinets; by 
the Committee of , Management, 
which consists of faculty members*; 
and representatives' of the Down­
town A'. M. C. A.
In the near future, a plan will be 
put into effect whereby, through 
co-operation with the Shadysidc 
Presbyterian ' Church, m e m b c r s 
from the Men’s Bible Class will 
make social visits ,Lo different' fra­
ternities of ;tli£ campus. Arrange­
ments wcr.c made at the request 
of Rev. Robert Steele, Chairman of 
the Student Relations Committee of 
the church, who states that the
¦members of. the Bible Class desire 
to become acquainted with the stu­
dents of the campus.
A .schedule is being drawn up,
and each fraternity will be assign­
ed one man to entertain. Rev.
Steele emphasizes that’ the visits 
of the men should be considered 
as . informal ones. Joseph Lentz 
has been appointed frbm the cab­
inet to work in conjunction with
Rev. Steele.

Extensive research programs arc 
being conducted by graduate stu­
dents in the Metallurgical Depart­
ment on a variety of technical sub­
jects which include the study of 
special alloys, carbides, steels of 
specific composition, and. other 
materials of commercial importance. 
The majority of the investigators 
hold, fellowships, while there arc 
four naval officers carrying out re­
search under the sponsorship of the 
government.
In the Bureau of Metallurgical 
Research, which was established in 
1924, there arc fourteen! graduate 
students, one from Canada, one 
from Sweden, another from New 
Zealand, and one from Oregon, 
working under the supervision of 
Dr. F. M. Walters, Jr., Director of 
the Bureau, and Professor V. N. 
Krcvobok of the Metallurgical De­
partment. At the present the 
.efforts of. the slaff. of the Bureau 
are concentrated on the iron-car- 
bon-mangancse system.
The four naval officers who have 
been sent to Carnegie by the 
government arc Lieutenants E. C. 
Rook, W. S. Kurtz, and A.' C. 
Murdaugh, and G. C. Towner of 
the United States Navy, who arc 
studying the "Effect of Rate of 
^Cooling on Steel Castings of Navy 
Specifications Steel.” Since' the 
government has the choice of any 
( school in the United States, Car­
negie has been singularly honored 
by the selection of its laboratories 
for the performance of these ex­
periments.
In the Bureau of Metallurgical 
Research, Cyril Wells, assistant 
metallurgist, who -was given his 
master’s degree last year,. is how 
studying the effect of .carbon on 
properties of 13% manganese alloy 
of iron. Mr. Wells formerly work­
ed under Professor Dcsch, em- 
ncnt invcstivator of Sheffield, and 
then was employed for three years 
by the Aluminum Company of 
Am cirqa. Maxwell Gcnsamcr, as­
sistant metallurgist, having grad­
uated from Carnegie Tech in ’24, 
is engaged in the investigation, of 
"Some phase? of the Allotropy of 
Iron." Mr. Gcnsamcr is. at present

Pitt Chapter of Cwens to 
B'e Guest At a 
Bridge
A very unusual tea dance will 
be given by the Cwens on Wed­
nesday, March II, in the Union 
from 4 to 6 o’clock. The dance

DR. IHRIG TO SPEAK AT 
WOOSTER CONFERENCE
Will Tell of Opportunities 
For Students in 
Engineering
Dr. Roscoe M. 1 hrig, director of’ 
the Division of General Studies; 
will pay a visit to . his first Alma 
Mater on March 13, when he will 
go to Wooster College at Wooster, 
Mass., to act as speaker at a voca­
tional conference for. students in­
terested ini engineering. Dr. 1 hrig 
will giv.c a general survey of the 
opportunities in the engineering 
field, taking up the training re­
quired, possibilities qf placement, 
salaries, and the responsibilities in­
volved.
According to Dr. llirig, the ideal 
type of training for the engineer 
should, include many more' general 
studies than arc '/now included in 
technical courses. However, lie be­
lieves such , a course cannot bfe 
achieved without extending the 
period of training to six' or' seven 
years. “Students who g/raduatc 
from sitch a. school as Wooster 
College before entering a, technical 
institution arc fortunate,” states 
Dr. I brig, “in that they have re­
ceived a foundation of general 
knowledge before taking Up tl'icir 
specialty. In this manner they get 
an ideal engineering course.”
This vocational .conference is an 
annual event a* Wooster College, 
and each year someone from a 
prominent engineering school is in­
vited to address the students. The 
meeting is of a rather informal 
nature, and the students are frec; 
to interview the speaker and ask 
questions at the conclusion of his 
address.
Several additional companies have 
made arrangements with the Bureau 
of(. Recommendations to interview 
seniors for future employment. The 
complete list of companies with the 
tentative dates of their visits now 
stands; General Electric Company, 
Thursday. March 12; Western Union, 
Friday, March 13; American Steel 
X- Wire Company, Wednesday,**March 
18; Standard Oil of N. Y., Thurs­
day. March 19; Leeds & Northrup, 
Friday, March 20; Firestone Tire & 
Rubber Company, Thursday and Fri­
day, March 26 and 27. ,
Other companies who have ex­
pressed a desire to visit Carnegie, 
but have not yet made, definite ar­
rangements for interviews are': Ohio 
Public Scrv|ce Company, Central Pub­
lic Service Company, Bailey Meter 
Company, Frigidaire C 6 m p a n y, 
Stephens, Adamsdn Manufacturing 
Company.
A number of seniors took the Civil 
Service examinations last week, and 
the Bureau wishes to advise those 
who feel they were not successful 
that there are a number of other 
examinations open in the near future 
for which technical- graduates arc 
eligible. The titles of some of these

girls of Margaret Morrison and the 
College of Fine Arts in recognition 
of meritorious work on Carnegie pub­
lications. Calls are. made on Quali­
fication Day.
Pi Delta Epsilon is., a national 
journalistic honorary fraternity which 
recognizes men who have done good 
work on Carnegie publications. The 
aim of the fraternity is to raise th' 
standards oi all publications, . .
According to news received 
cently by Prof. Howcr, head of the 
physics department, Mr. Sam Lybar- 
ger, graduate of the department in 
1930, and at present physicist for the 
A. M. -Myers and Son Company of 
Mt. Lebanon, in conjunction with 
Mr. licller. has just devised a new 
apparatus for the Mayo Clinic for 
the testing of hearing.
This apparatus makes use of a 
vacuum tube oscillator which gives 
all frequencies in steps of one tone, 
from sixty-four vibrations per sec; 
ond up through seven octaves. The 
acuteness of hearing of an individual 
is measured at each pitch in “audi­
tion units” which arc then compared 
with normal hearing on a special 
chart.
Mr. Lybargcr has also invented a 
special type of tone control for the

On Friday, April 10, the bi-annual 
Arts Ball will “go Spanish" in the
foyer of the Fine Arts building
from nine till four, states Chair­
man Brennan, of the Arts Ball 
Committee. On Saturday night, 
April 11, from nine till twelve, the 
same orchestra and decorations will 
furnish background for the Post- 
Arts Ball which is open to all
students in all schools.
This year's hall, the first for 
four years is to be spanish in tone, 
and the costumes arc to show a 
wide vari.cty of research covering 
all periods and all places that have 
felt Spanish influence. Medieval 
troubadors and CastHlian beggars, 
will concort with grandees from 
Madrid and rancho « owners . from 
Southern California. Since _ this 
will be their first opportunity for 
some years to strut on home terri­
tory, the Art students arc cxpcctcd 
to exert their resources to achieve 
color,, originality, and gaiety in 
costumcs.
The decorations, the .plans for 
which arc now ¡well under way, in 
the Department of Architecture, as 
a problem in decoration, will com­
pletely transform the present Rc- 
naissant foyer into gorgeous Span­
ish settings. ( A cabaret supper, with 
entertainments, will be serVcd in 
the Exhibition Hall. The final 
choice of an orchestra for the Ba 
has not yet been made although 
much consideration lias been given 
to a number of well-known 
chcstras and it is cxpcctcd that a 
final choice will soon be made.
All students enrolled in the Col­
lege of Fine Arts, including those 
registered for part time and in 
Night School, arc eligible -to at­
tend. An assembly will be held 
today and every Tuesday at noon 
in the Little Theatre at which an 
orchestra directed by Willibald 
Ryshanck will play. This- orches­
tra, however, •will not play for the 
‘Arts Ball.
Tickcts for the Ball which will be 
sold at $4.00 can be purchased from 
any member of the committee and 
during noon hours at desks con 
venientlv located in the halls. In 
the spirit of an Arts Ball, it should 
he known that it is traditional for 
girls to buy their own tickcts >an 
that it is not essentially a “couples” 
affair.

in the city of Pittsburgh. However, 
the orchestra will not be making its 
first appearance in Pennsylvania, as 
it has recently played for an affair 
held at Penn State. The commit­
tee in charge has been, very fortunate 
in obtaining Dan Grcgor}r, as lie is 
much in demand especially among 
the Southern 'Schools, including 
V.MJ. Tennessee, and Georgia Tech.
Favors, entirely different from any 
in previous years, hayc been pur­
chased.. These will be. distributed 
upon entering the ball room on the 
night of the formal.
Following the custom of former 
years, the decorations will consist 
of banners from each arid every 
fraternity on the campus. These ban­
ners will be arranged around the 
balcony of the ball room. To aid in 
the decoration, the fraternities arc 
requested to turn in their banners 
immediately to Carson of the Sigma . 
Phi' Epsilon Fraternity House.
Tickcts for the affair have already 
been distributed among the various 
fraternities, arid arc'~‘bciiig' sold for 
.$5.,
Chaperones will include Mr. and 
Mrs.' A. E. Riscdorph, Dr. and Mrs. 
Neeley and Mr. and Mrs. R. V. 
Davis. The patrons and patronesses 
include Dr. Baker, Dean Green, Dean 
and Mrs. Tarbell, and Dean Kecble. •
Last year the' Intcrfraternity formal 
was held in the ballroom of the 
Schcnlcy Hotel. However, encourag­
ed by the large attendance last year, 
the committee have decided upon the 
William Penn Ballroom -where a 
.larger number of couples can lie ac­
commodated. In addition better check­
ing facilities have been arranged that 
arc greatly superior to those of 
former ;years.
Continuing the custom of former 
years, many of the fraternities are 
giving breakfasts at their respective 
houses after the formal. In order 
that they may attend those breakfasts, 
dorm women will be permitted to 
stay out until 4:30..

B. Iden Payne, • former head of 
the Carnegie Drama department, 
will portray the leading role in 
the Y. M. and Y. W. H. A. Play­
house production • of the dramati­
zation ,of Jules Verne's’ novel, 
“Around the World in 80 Days.” 
The selection of the cast was 
made by Mr. Payne himself, and 
by Helen R. Stout, who are joint­
ly directing the project. The play 
will be given on March 24, 25 
and 26.
The part taken by Mr. Payne is 
that of “Phineas"' Fog,” the Eng­
lishman, who makes a wager to 
circle the globe iii eighty days. 
To those familiar with Mr. Payne's 
work at the Carnegie Little Thea­
ter, or with his activities at the 
“Y” Playhouse, his .reputation as 
actor and director needs little 
comment. He lias appeared in 
the Chicago production of “Around 
the World in 80 Days,” which the 
Goodman Theater produced with 
-marked success. In that perform­
ance, however, he took the part 
of "Passepartout,” the remarkable 
French valet, who forget to turn 
out the gas.” The part of “Pas.se- 
pratout” will he played in the 
Playhouse by Alfred E. Smith, a 
veteran of many “Y” Playhouse 
productions.
“Fix,” the persistent detective 
who resorts to numerous disguises 
in the determination to “get him 
yet,” will be played by Harold i 
Goldstein. He has recently ap­
peared on the professional stage. 
Another professional is Norman 
Porter, who has been appearing in 
productions on Broadway. The 
part of “Archibald Corsican,” a 
roughcut, big-hearted American, 
will be taken by Richard Fishel. 
Alma Lind, a drama school gradu­
ate, plays a “lady of the company.”

A vSHlFTED LINEUP, in which “Pec-Wee” Leonard 
entrusted his guard’s position to Siegel while he filled Smith’s 
shoes at. forward, displayed a brand of ball superior to that 
of the Carlson aggregation even though the prodigal Eddie 
Bakef’s last minute bucket did win the game for the Panthers.
There is certainly no room for criticism in the Tartan's 
play either as'a team or as individuals.
k NCE MORE TI-IE BOXERS take to the stage, 
this time to meet the West Virginia Mountain­
eers in a return match Thursday. In the first 
encounter at Morgantown, the West Virginians 
| took a one-sided verdict over the green Plaid 
outfit. Since their previous encounter, however, 
the Tartans have come along at a fast pace 
and the score should be far from the 6'/-¿-/i 
count by which the Blue and Yellow won in 
their home ring. Everyone of importance socially was at the 
last bout but with the usual dance afterward being ommittcd, the crowd Thursday will probably be composed of boxing fans,
THE PEEBE CAGERS again played an each man for him 
self game, and lost to the Panther Cubs, &r/-'J8.
In contrast to the first meeting of the two putii.ts, the i’itt 
Ereshman lead throughout the en­
tire contest and outplayed the 
Plebes both offensively and de­
fensively. By this time, the Year­
lings should have learned their les­
son on teamwork, having suffered 
all their other defeats because of1 
individual rather than team efforts.
Out of fairness .to the PJebes who have made a mighty 
fine showing in a number of games this season we should 
remember that they suffered a heavy, blow at the end of the 
first semester when their two outstanding members, Radabaugh 
and Jagnow, were declared ineligible, Much of the success or 
failure of next year's squad depends upon the reserve material 
that the plebes are counted upon1to furnish and if Radabaiigh 
and Jagnow become eligible it would riot be surprising' to lind 
some of this year’s varsity five on the bench when the season 
of ’3V32 gets under way.
THE FLOUNDERING GREEKS and the Dormitory men 
will stage a fashionable display of swimming in its various 
forms 'March 20, to decide who shall possess the trophy until 
the next meet. The eligibility ruling eliminates only good 
swimmers, such as letter men, or point scorcrs of this season’s 
Tartan outfits.
As yet no team has succeeded in tallying three wjns foi 
permanent possession of the reatlcsB cup which has adorned no 
less than four mantelpieces during the last five years. The 
DU’s however, are in a position this year to-'dcal the final blow, 
having already possessed it for two years.
The pedigre.e of the cup begins back in '19125 when the 
Theta Xi’s made a clcan sweep of the meet. In the succeeding 
years, the trophy has been displayed by the Pi K. A’s, the 
Betas, DU’s, Kappa Sigs and the DU’s. Events included cover 
all styles of swimming and "fajicy” diving. Entries must be in 
to Coach Risedorph by March 16.
THIS WEEK BOTH FRESHMAN AND VARSITY 
track candidates have been called. The varsity reported yester­
day and with the season’s opening less than two months away, 
work has started in earrres.t. The Freshmen are scheduled to 
report tomorrow and anyone with ahy ability should report. 
You don’t have to be a high school star to come out for track 
at Carnegie. Some, of the men who hold school records have 
been developed under the sole tutelage of Coach Halferty, for 
many years coach of both track and cross-country at his old 
Alma-Mater.
This year’s prospects are exceptionally bright, with a nym- 
&.er of last year’s point scorers on hand and a strong group 
from the sterling Plebc outfit from last year as a foundation, a 
well balanced squad is assured.
IF ANYONE HAD LOOKED TWICE AT THE FIRST 
BASEMAN of the Pirates b^U club in the newsreel taken at 
Paso Robles, lie would have recognized him as our own "Doc” 
Marks. "Doc” has also been headlining in the local papers 
as the guardian of the ball players’ health. Those pictures of 
him using fie.“car phopcs” on the pitchers’ arms to sccf how 
many ball games they’re going to win seem to have made a 
big hit around the campus.
BERT MUNHALL SUGGESTS a change in gridiron rules 
concerning the extra point after a touchdown. Bert would have 
the valuation of the grace point determined by the method of 
procedure. To kick the goal would credit one point to the 
scoring team s total, to put the ball over via the air route would 
add two extra points, and to succeed in a line play would en­
title the offense to three points. Several years ago Bert re­
ceived a great deal of publicity on his suggestions, but as <^et 
the National Rules Committee has not considered the change. 
Being an old timer in the grid sport, he speaks from experience 
and not; fancy, and no doubt his suggestions will at least re­
ceive consideration in the near future.

Lose Second Game 
To Panther Quint
Baker’s Last Minute Bas­
ket Gives Pitt Verdict 
and City Series
Last Friday night the Carnegie 
Tccli Basketball team invaded; the 
realms of the Pitt- Stadium- in 
search of a victory ovijr the highly 
touted Golden Panthers, ‘hut after 
forty minute« of ’hard play, in 
which the Plaid team put fought the 
Panthers, they emerged with a 
two point defeat, the final score 
being 27-25. Jt was, the ‘second 
time this year that the’Tartans had 
tried to beat that Pitt team; and 
the second that the,y have been 
nosed out in I hr. last liiiniitcs of 
play.
Entering the game minus the.j 
services of Bob Smith, high scoring 
ace of the Carn'cgie five, but with 
a spirit of determination, it did'not 
take long to show Pitt that ,w.ith 
or without Smith it was going to 
be a good ball , gamp. Presenting 
a lineup which showed Jimmy 
Leonard, regular guard, shifted to 
forward, and stocky '‘.Curly”. Sicgal 
taking Jimmy's place , at guard, 
Carnegie soon went into the lead. 
With the score ¿it three-all liy vir­
tue of a field gp;il by Leonard and 
a foul, the Scots stepped', up their 
offens.e raising the count to'10-3. 
y\fter Pitt’s time out/they scorpd a 
field goal and proceeded .with a 
foul shooting exhibition.. tylany 
time? the official's whistle. blc\y and 
many times the CaHspnitcs '. toed 
the line for free’ tlirp.ws by. vh'tue 
of which they brouglit -the score 
up to 10-9. Then tq .9veil „th.ings 
up, the officials gave• Carnegie a 
free throw, changing the1 score to 
11-9. Just is it looked .safe, for 
the half anyway, Baker, got a pass 
around mid-court, pivoted, and with 
hardly a wink at the • basket' let 
it: fly through the hoop, tying the 
score as the half ended.
The second half was full of. joy, 
excitement, and dcspajr. Pitt'got 
off to a five point lead, but didn’t 
retain it long, Carnegie ,cutting it 
down to 011c. Once again • -.Pitt 
raised its advantage to ,five ¡points 
and once again tliis’ was brought 
down to one. Pitt then ' began 
Ihc/r stalling la'el.ics and •after • the 
remaining time .¡in the half . had 
dwindled to four n/injitcs,. the •Tar­
tans went out to cover ,tlieir. op­
ponents. With three minutes left, 
the Plaid quintet was. still -behind 
five points. liter c ,they: began,, to 
rally. Fergus started - it: off by 
sinking a foul and Armcntrout, who 
hud replaced Sicgal, .threw one in 
from the side jwhicji reduccdthe 
lead to two points. With hut a 
minulc left to play Fergus passed 
to Stent/, who pivoted, dribbled 
around Albright and put in a one- 
hand .‘>1,101 from , the side of : the 
basket, tying the score. Just; as it 
looked as though an oycrtimc 
period would bo necessary, Baker 
.snatched a pass1 a little past the 
center of the floor, stopped, let 
the ball go, straight and true, with­
out a bit of arclv hitting the 'back 
rim of the basket. :nvd' caroiUming 
down through the hoop to give 
Pitt their margin of victpvyi Be­

Undaunted by a previous 50-14 
defeat at the hands of the Pitt 
Varsity, the Skibo swimmers re­
turned to the water and bequeath­
ed a 50-25 verdict upon the West­
ern Il.cs.crvit.cs in a hotly contest­
ed meet last Saturday.
While lifting the laurels from 
the Red Cats of Cleveland, the 
Varsity tankmen copped six of the 
eight first placcs. Scmplc, of 
Western Reserve, scored a clean 
victory in the breast stroke, but 
the Plaid medley re layers ext'end- 
cd their opponents to a fast pace 
for the hitter's first place in that 
event.
Captain Al Redding . emerged 
with the day's honors, these in­
cluding firsts in t'1,10 50 and 100- 
yard (lashes with a share - in the 
winning, free . style r(clay. Al's 
splendid work in the 50-yar.dcr 
enabled him to nose out the op­
posing visitor in a fast race, 
while • lie finished the 100 with a 
reater lead. Estabrookc com­
pleted maneuvers from the diving, 
board in JincV form, taking first 
place in that event. Later he gain­
ed a sccond in the long 220-yard 
swim, and also took part in the 
winning relay.
Edwards, with his nut'stach' con­
stantly before him, took a -well- 
earned victory in the 220-yard free 
style. He also splashed favorably 
in the relay. Cadmus came through 
\Vilh his first iii the back stroke, 
and Was followed shortly by Ha­
zelwood. In the breast stroke 
Frairkc pulled a sccond with 
Looney in third place, jerge, help­
ed the scoring' with a sccond in 
the 100-yard free style.
In the Pitt meet the Panthers 
romped about the pool in a more, 
or less cramped style for the 
Tartan tankers continually pressed 
them for whatever they gained. 
The fray began with- Pitt being 
disqualified in the 200-yard free 
style, relay for paddling in the 
wrong -place. From them 011 it 
was mostly a matter of shoot,i.ng 
the gun and clicking the watch. 
However, Redding turned in a 
good performance in taking scc­
ond in the 100-yard and a third in 
the 50-yard dashes,
Saturday at 2:3,0 the varjUty 
natalors ¡\vjll Oppose the team from 
Case in the Carnegie pool. The 
yisitin.g Clevelanders have been de­
feated, 50-25, by Pitt earlier this 
season. These comparative scores 
give an inkling to the effect that 
Coach Rosedoj-ph’s men will have 
to step lively to overtake the Case 
aggregation. At the same time 
next Saturday the Plebes will put 
forth their best effort.s to drown 
the hopes of the Kiski mermen. 
There arc no admission require­
ments to these meets.
Ski bos Victorious Over 
Nillany Lion Riflemen
Saturday afternoon the Tartan rifle 
team kept its shouldcr-to-shoul<;lcr 
record clean by squeezing out a three 
point victory over Penn State’s crack 
'riflemen' at the Carnegie Range, 1354 
to 1351. Smyser of the Penn State 
aggregation led the individual scor­
ing with a 275, but lie was closely 
lagged by Painter and Schcrba of the 
Tartan squad, both • of whom had 
274.
In the telegraphic competition, the 
qpposition was by far the toughest 
encountered this season, and the 
Plaids tasted defeat for the first 
time. Carnegie’s score was 1S53; Day­
ton University came in first with 
a phenomenal score of 1901, Texas
Team to Encounter Rival* of 
Boxing Debut in Home 
Bouts Thursday
With a return bout with WcsL 
Virginia scheduled for Thursday 
night, Coach Sesto is now rounding 
his squad into shape with the ex­
pectation of surprising the strong 
Mountaineer aggregation. The teaini 
has now recovered from the affects 
of the Syracuse meet and should :bc 
in fine shape. The bouts arc sched­
uled to get under way at 8:30, and 
after the enthusiasm " shown at the 
Syracuse jousts, "Buddy" Ovcrcnd 
is anticipating a .rccord turnout. ,
One of the high points of last 
week's practice was the improved 
showing of "Tank" Highbcrgcr. In 
his last match, his most glaring weak­
ness was his failure to employ his 
right at the proper time. Tf "Tank” 
was able- to beat a tough and ex­
perienced boxer such as. Mcchener 
without a right and is now able to 
use. .said right, Mr. Hawkins, West 
Virginia’s golden glove champ, should 
be in for a very busy, evening.
Captain Ducanis has also looked 
very good in recent workouts, his 
footwork and punching seeming to 
improve steadily. At Morgantown 
"Alex” was held to a draw by Carr, 
but lie hopes -tp cop the decision this 
time.
"Mike” Rcstaine, who has been out 
the last week on account of sickness, 
is now back getting in shape. By 
working out every day.; "Mike" 
should be in ' top form against 
Stunkard, who will represent West 
Virginia in .’the 145 pound division. 
As usual. .“Eddie" Ashe will be 
banding out the lefts and rights in 
the 125 pound category, "Eddie’,’ be­
ing eager to avenge that one round 
kayo he suffered in his first en­
counter against Fisher.
In the 135 pound class the Plaid 
will be capably represented by Affelt- 
rangcr,. who will again meet Hesse 
of the Mountaineers. Poiincey, who 
impressed the crowd with his ability 
to take it in the ‘West Virginia 
jucet,. will’ sw,ap blows with Latham, 
.a.boy with a-real. reputation in inter­
collegiate boxing circles.
The last time the Skibos' encount­
ered the Mountaineers they were; 
forced to 'default the 115 pptlrid class 
bout:, but it is cxpdcted that Logan, 
'after !giyihg. am ’..intercollegiate champ 
such a tough' iijne '-of it twp yve'ckS' 
ago, will be able to handle such an 
assignment this time.
Coacli Sesto has been ably as­
sisted in drilling his charges by 
t"Bill” Kurtz, a - fprmer Navy man 
who fought in the 135 class. Wil­
liam Kleindinst now has active charge 
of the managerial duties, Bill Tauriel- 
lo having been declared ineligible 
after the semester exams.
The Plebc match with Bcllcfontc, 
scheduled for last Saturday, was post­
poned in order to give the team more 
time to get in shape. A definite 
time for the meet Iras not been set 
as yet.

Plebc splashers duplicated the 
work of-..tlieir older teammates in 
the past week-, by ending up on V
50-50, basis- in the matter of meets 
won and 'lost. Pitt Fr,osh gained a
51-14 victory, but the Plaid fresh­
men were successful again sf the 
Eric Academv I*Iigh to the amount
f 38-30.
Although the. first placcs were 
evenly divided in the Erie jmcct, 
the Tartan freshmen scored hcay.i-j 
ly iu tlie sccond and third placcs.
This fact virtually proved to 
ibe the •undoing of the visiting highi 
ichool boys. The Plebes started 
things off with a victory ' in the: 
200-yard relay. Vonder Lanckcuj 
crossed the finish line with an 
easy first in the .breast stroke, He; 
was followed by Thompson, also 
of Vlic freshmen. Pal Miller un­
raveled a . neat, 50' and 100-yards 
to give him a very close second 
in each, event, Derdeyn. filling the 
third place both tim.es. Boyer took 
his usual first in the back stroke 
with about 15 feet, to spare. Sec­
ond ¦ and third placcs in the diving, 
were filled by Bright and . Bostick, 
respectively.
The Panther cubs showed a su­
perior brand of water- splashing1 in 
defeating the Tartan ducklings. 
Bovcr turned in live only first 
place for the Plebes, this being in 
the back stroke race. Vonder 
Lauckcn accounted for a second in 
the breast stfoke, and likewise 
Miller,, in the 100-yard dash.
The. Plebes. are booked for two 
more wiit'cry. encounters this werck. 
Friday at 4:30 the Schenlcy High 
School boys wil.l ' come over for 
a dip. Saturday at 2:30 Kiski will 
be met' in conjunction with, the 
varsity jueet. Both meets will be 
held in the Carnegie pool with 
free admission.

Pitt Freshmen Maintain Lefv. 
Over Plebe Rally in 
Second Half
In the preliminary to the sccond 
Pitt-Carncgie contest to decide the 
city championship, the Tartar year­
lings suffered a 27-1S deteat at the 
hands, of the Pitt Freshmen.. Contrary 
to the style ot play exhibited -iri 
their first encounter -,vith the young 
Pittites, the Plebe quint was severely 
lacking in teamwork against the well- 
drilled opponents.
Throughout the first half, the 
Panther cubs met with little difficulty 
in effecting their, block plays and in 
piercing the Plebe's' defense for close 
range shots at the basket. On rc-' 
turning to tlic lloor for the sccond 
period, however, the Tartan year­
lings rallied momentarily to score 
enough points to threaten the lead 
held by their hosts. At this point, 
the University Freshmen also rallied 
and the- lead held by them increased 
and decreased with the possession 
of the ball. The belated comeback 
staged against the Skibo yearlings,- 
•however, gradually gave the Fresh­
men a safe advantage which they / 
held until the end.
In contrast to the first contest be­
tween the two ’34 outfits, the PJebes 
played more as individuals than as a 
team, and made numerous wild 
stabs at the basket. There is no 
doubt but that the absence of Rala- 
baiigh and Jagnaw from the lineup
had its affects on the/ teamwork of Uic_
by Carnegie (Vonder Lauckcn, Boy­
er, La Chance*. Miller). Time—1:49.

Nothing small about this work
Reaching, out to the far corners of the 
earth for raw materials of telephone ap­
paratus, is a Western Electric function 
in the Bell System.
To assure adequate sources of supply, 
men engaged in this work of mass pur­
chasing continually search the entire 
globe. To buy wisely, they study all 
factors affecting prices — economic and 
labor conditions, transportation facil-
ities, freight rates—on a world-wide 
scale. Each year their purchases, worth 
many millions of dollars, include such 
diverse products as platinum from 
Russia, mica from India, asphalt from 
Venezuela, flax from Belgium and 
France.
All in all, a vast and fascinating task. 
For men of keen business judgment,

No, I haven't lost anything on 
the campus .except, possibly, a great 
many h.ghts when I could be doing 
some other work. Possibly calling on 
the G. F., going to shows, ctc. BuL 
who wants to do that 'when there is 
a. school like 'Carnegie Tech right at 
. . your door? Jt is too bad, however, 
that things will be lost and it is also 
too bad that the owners arc so hard 
to be located. I suppose the best ad­
vice I can give is—don't lost any­
thing,^snot even your assignments for 
the next class.^
Well—wc have thorn at last—
• Catacombs in the Arts School—At 
least that is' what that hew tunnel 
looks like, when you conic up the 
stairs at the lower entrance of the 
building. They have buried the tele­
phone booths in the heart of tin 
subterraneous passage now, so it 
•should be easy to seclude yourself
for a telephone date with the.; on? 
and only. It is a wonder. this ihnor 
; .vation was not thought of be-foic 
instead of making us walk up a 
flight of stairs only to descend on 
the other side it you wanted to get 
to the oilier end oi the building 
Such improvements come slowly, and 
when- they do come they arc doubly 
appreciated. Getting back lo the Cata­
comb idea, what more appropriate 
place than the Arts School for such 
a • setting? Rome is the scene of 
,'l these historical placcs; Rome is also 
the home of Fine Arts; so wc have 
r Catacombs, Fine• Arts, Arts School; 
'¦ ivhat more complete combination
'i :ould be found?'
Have you ever noticed the way 
. some of the art students leave their
• palettes in the studio? No, 1 don't 
mean palate, although, cigarette smok­
ing seems lb be a very palatable
• ’ " past time for them. Go -where you 
' will, you will see them puffing at 
the ..vile -weed—yes, 1 do it too, but 
that doesn’t count. Wliat 1 had in
... mind before I idled on was the un-
(¦- * idyl.:-way in which thq studios are
, left a(ter the. classes.. You can hard­
ly pass through the rooms without 
¦ getting paint on your smock, and 
. then you say something which—well 
rVi you know. A little thought- should 
make these artist more careful
with their pigments,- etc.. If you 
don’t understand, take a walk through 
•'. some of the studios in P. ari(l D.
on the third and fourth floors of
tjie Arts Building. You can’t walk 
up that far—well—they have eleva­
tors—but try .and use them without
,r'.kcys.
Were you at the Dance‘on. the 
twenty-third? No—Well ,you missed 
the treat of your young life, it was 
. a great affair" and well attended. Lots 
of punch and cakes, ctc. Yes—Well 
1 don't need to say any more be­
cause your being there certainly in­
dicated . that you know where good 
' times are'to- be. had. Sure, was a big 
success. No need to ask when the 
next one will be, becausc I looked in
the handbook and note that one will
be held on May S. Long way ahead, 
% - but it -'ivon’t take Jong to get there.
STUDY ROOM NOTES
Night Student Council 
Scores Another Success
With the playing of the last strains 
of the Home Waltz at the Wash­
ington’s Birthday Dance on February 
23 the Night Student Council termi­
nated another successful function 
given for the enjoyment of the 
night students. These extra-curricular 
activities are sponsored by the Night 
Student Council for the benefit o£ the 
night students and they go a long 
way in creating a spirit of fellowship 
in the night group. The support given 
in return indicates that the efforts 
of the council and the committee 
and works arc appreciated.
The orchestra made a wonderful 
impression on the dancers and they 
clamored for encore after encore 
until finally the dance had to pro­
ceed in order to complete the pro­
gram. We can say without hesitation 
that Carl Ludwig's group of music­
ians certainly know how to produce 
the correct music at the proper time. 
Wc hope that wc will hear more 
from this orchestra.
The guests of the evening were 
Mr. and Mrs. Raymond S. Simboli 
and Mr. and Mrs: Mauricc L. Car­
roll, Jr.
A marvelous scheme of decora­
tion was employed at this dance an,d 
it certainly made a remarkable show­
ings It was hard to realize that you 
were dancing in the Gymnasium. At 
a given time thousands of balloons 
descended upon the dancers to which 
were attached little floats decorated 
with appropriate colonial scenes..
Any one walking down the corri­
dors of. the Engineering Hall for 
the first time, just before evening 
classes and seeing clouds of smoke 
well from a room might have an 
impulse to 'send in a fire alarm.
• L'poir closer observation, lie would 
find just a study room filled with 
students arid smoke.
The. room seems lo be the favor­
ite gathering place for those stu­
dents who need, a little more prep­
aration for class or, for those Avlio 
often wonder, why their answers 
never agree with those in the 
books. Every available bit of 
space is filled with students and 
:he usual querjv /‘Did you get all 
vour problems, and what’s, your 
inswer?” is uppermost.
Here in one corner is. a battery 
>f pipes breezing along, while over 
. :hcrc is' a 'quartet of chimneys 
:lceply engrossed in 'some mysteri­
ous (.?) book. Sure js some noise 
n the air,, with everyone gping 
;iroiig to heat the class hell. A 
:ew more chairs • would be fine, 
since ¿some of - us have to line up 
ind take turns waiting for a seat.
The musical (?) pipes, • quiet 
:igarettes, rustling pages, here and 
:hrrc a slide rule in operation, 
md above all a great cloud of 
smoke—all make a familiar scene 
t.o many of us, and our favorite 
•bought “Maybe the text is wrong;
I can’t get the same answer." is 
very appropriate. A nice place for 
stiidy (?)—but a good place to 
hear the latest news, or pass along 
a few remarks, and to meet the 
same old hunch; that's the stud.v- 
rooni.
Quite a range—from one reading 
the evening paper to those deeply 
engrossed in abstract theory, \yhat. 
would the enginerrs do without 
any study room? Of course, sonic 
use the stairs to park on, where 
everyone else can walk on them, f 
but it is not the same. Our line} 
of thought seems to he "A stud:- 
room inste’-J of a night~club.” *

OPPORTUNITY -
Opportunity is a necessary fore­
runner of accomplishment. To pro­
mote the welfare of 1 finnan rela­
tions, , to advance high ideals—in 
brief to achieve any desired results, 
the opportunity must prevail. To 
bring about certain events or ma­
terial things, a .person or group ,of 
persons can create, opportunities or 
conditions which will demand that 
ways and means be contrived to 
make it possible for certain ' work 
to be done. Inventions have been 
made and old methods have been 
improved in the past, due to cir­
cumstances caused by the acts of 
people in the natural course of 
events. ' However, there is nothing 
to prevent anyone’s future actions 
being planned with the definite 
purpose of creating a specified con­
dition which will require his con­
tinued efforts, as well as the addi­
tional efforts of others, to realize 
some greater result which was 
formerly unknown or , unexper­
ienced.
As an illustration allow ine to 
remind you that opportunities were 
presented by the World War for 
the advancement of aeronautics, 
chemistry, .'surgery, radio, submarine 
transport, mass production, ctc. 
Furthermore, the plan of a person 
or group of persons to eventually 
ercat'e a world empire was the 
primary impetus of this war or, in 
another sense, opportunity for 
greater and more beneficial achieve­
ment. So that you may not mis­
construe the foregoing illustration 
as- a recommended manner of pro- 
aviding opportunities, I wish to 
point out the possibilities of such 
a project as *a Lakes to Sea system 
of canals and waterways- in the 
United States. This task 'would fur­
nish an opportunity to the Engineer 
for practical scientific achievement; 
an opportunity to the Farmer for 
utilization of irrigation possibilities; 
an opportunity to the Industrialist 
for opening a hew and less costly 
means 'of transportation of raw ma­
terials and finished products; and 
many other opportunities for vari­
ous important achievements and 
improvements.
If this discourse has interested 
you, it ma3% perhaps, suggest to 
you some big, worthwhile endeavor, 
such as the work of securing the 
proposed Students Activities Build­
ing for Carnegie, which / in turn
SECRETARY
willserve as a means for numerous
opportunities for ourselves and 
future Carnegie students. I will 
then feel that my purpose in trying 
to coiiycy to you a big opportunity 
which is within our reach, has been 
fulfilled and its', erection consum­mated.

“Y” CLUB ROOM
Last week the Plaid called atten­
tion tu the "Y” Club Room which 
has been placed at the disposal of the 
night students, and a request was 
made that the magazines be replaced 
in the racks when the students were 
finished with them.
It has been noticed that studcnts 
thoughtlcssly walked off with some 
of these magazines thereby decreas­
ing the number available to other stu­
dents. It is requested that none of 
these magazines be removed from 
the room, and we know that the 
night students will co-operate so that 
the club room will function to the 
satisfaction of everybody.
At this time it is the pleasure of 
the Plaid to present Mr. William R. 
Hoddcr, Secretary of the Night Stu­
dent Council. Mr. Hoddcr is also 
Vice President of the Night College 
of Engineering.
Another veteran night student of 
the Carnegie. Institute-of Technology, 
Mr. lioddei; has come back year 
after year pursuing a course in, the 
Department of Mechanical Engineer­
ing where lie cxpccts tq obtain his 
decree. It is indeed a pleasure to 
meet a student nf the calibre of 
Mr. Hoddcr as he has been eon- 
sistant throughout his long years on 
the campus.
After the foi .nation of the Night 
Student Counc.l lie supported the 
organization in every way possible. 
Me was a reporter for the SKIBO 
when this publication was; used to 
publish news lor the night students 
and later, when the Plaid- made its 
appeardncc, he contributed news items 
for the student body. He has served 
on the Social Committee of the Night 
Student Council for £ several years, 
and during the year 1929-30 was 
Social Chairman in which capacity 
lie made an enviable record for 
extra curricular activities, as this 
was the first year tlie Council held 
dances in the Men's Gymnasium and 
it required a great deal of inginuity 
to siiccessfully transfer these daiiccs 
from the Union to the Auditorium, a 
feat which was accomplished with 
much credit to his ability. His efforts 
on, the Night Engineering Banquet 
during the present year to give the 
night engineers ' a successful affair 
also demonstrate that he is a' re­
sourceful leader, as the banquet \vas 
one of the most successful ones ever 
held.
ENTERTAINMENT FOR 
NIGHT ENGINEERING 
SMOKER SOLICITED
The program for the Night- En­
gineering Smoker which will be 
held on March 21, is in the mak­
ing,' and the committee in charge 
of the affair is anxious to hear 
from night engineering students 
who might, have some talent which 
could be used in the entertainment. 
It is felt that a better spirit would 
be ‘created if the student body 
could participate. Y’ou may have 
a! stunt • that ¦ you feel you could 
put over. Any type of entertain­
ment will be considered. lL may 
be dancing, monologues, diologues, 
acrobatic, singing, or playing on 
a musical instrume!^.
If any night engii.\:ring student 
has anything to offer .-.e should get 
in touch with . the officers of., his 
school before March 10. so that 
he may. be - given consideration.
T. J. W.
HAP ON THE AIR
Well. I've scraped off the caked 
ink from my, pen in response to 
the call from J. J. F., and if you 
and the editor can stand it, so 
can I. Those who can’t will prob­
ably have to read the Sporting 
News or From the Fence, or some 
other more interesting netfs items. 
You know, where there is a will 
there is a way, and, also that prac- 
lice makes perfect, so here goes.
Let me think—what can I write 
about? (Click—click—click — deep
thought.) I have it—Mid-term' ex­
ams. Now, that’s a topic which 
should interest' all of the night 
students, J. J. F. included. Exami­
nations, according to a standard 
dictionary, in a general Avay means 
to scrutinize carefully, and that is 
just how our instructors put the 
works to the classes—and how. Wc' 
are about due for these pesky 
things and the sooner they are 
over the better, so say we all.
THE PARKING PROBLEM
What’s the matter with the en- 
gincers? I haven’t seen any con- 
tribs from them for some time. 
Guess I’ll have to take up arms 
for them, so here goes. ,
No one has mentioned the park­
ing problem lately; any one bc.cn 
bothered by it? Some of the fel­
lows get down to school £ little 
late, then have to drive up and 
down the streets looking for a 
place to leave the old boat. Re­
minds me of an excursion or sight­
seeing trip with no stops.
When, apparently, we see a nice 
spot and put the car there just to 
find some lost fire plug staring us 
in the eye, our feelings arc none 
too good. I never saw so many 
plugs roaming around loose be­
fore; looks like they wait until 
you park and then walk up and
plant themselves right there. What 
this country needs is a portable 
parking space. Some night engi­
neer ought to look into this.
One fellow parked his car close 
to the school, expecting to lcave^
at nine-thirty, but when that time
rolled around, lie found the cars
in the front and rear of his car 
so closely parked that the bumpers 
touched. Result — one hour of
quiet (?) contemplation of the
evils of parking. Only time lie
ever wanted an Austin.
Wonder what" some of the engi- 
nceds have in the last hour any­
way. ' One engineer, who could 
never find a parking space closer 
to the school than several blocks, 
one night parked right .next: to the 
school. Still in a daze (?) from 
his last class, lie came out and
marched down the street to his 
old parking place and was aston­
ished when lie found no car of 
his parked there. After several 
moments, he walked’ back'to where 
he started and found Ills car. Won­
der how much time" he saved?
Notice any absent-minded engi­
neers wandering through the corri­
dors lately? Some arc just won­
dering .where they left their cars, 
and whether they can find them 
soon enough to avoid a ticket. 
Between this parking problem and 
classes, no wonder some of the 
poor" engineers’ heads reflect the 
light. _ C. I. S.

GLORIA MUND1
The brain that led the revolt of 
the Ri'-sian peasants against the 
old order of things has now be­
come a mere subject for the in­
spection.' of tlie scientists who arc 
attempting to wrest a greater 
knowledge of the structure' of the 
human brain from such specimens 
of unusual history as they can 
obtain.
Nikolai1 Lenin, in life, dreamed 
great things, t h o it g h t great 
thoughts, and, actuated by this same 
brain, achieved’ the soimwhat dubi­
ous freedom the nuijiks now en­
joy. Now, however, it is an object 
o' • iosity among the savants who 
sec in it the possible solution of 
some of thcir theories doling with 
the bearing of the cell-structure of 
the brain on, its , efficiency.
Lenin was. undoubtedly a forceful 
ma.., and his name has been the 
foundation of the closc. thing to 
a religion the Communists allow 
themselves. U is singularly strik­
ing that the Soviets were so easily 
persuaded to permit the removal 
of the brain, not only out of the 
dead leader’s body, but also out of 
the U. S. S. R.
It has been at the Kaiser Wil­
helm Institute, in- Berlin, and was 
recently taken from Berlin to the 
Pasteur Institute in Paris for ex­
amination by the eminent French 
surgeons connected with this inter­
nationally known institution. Much 
discussion has been the outcome 
of the various studies that have 
been made of the brain, and evi­
dently, with the comparatively 
small store of knowledge the world 
has on this subject, there is small 
hope for any startling discoveries 
to be made.
Irreverent and cold-blooded as it 
may seem at first thought, we must' 
condone the gruesomeness of the 
affair by admitting that vivisection 
and dissection of living' arid dead 
bodies, wh-Mi properly conducted 
and understanding^ observed, have 
advanced present day surgery al­
most to the realms of the impossi­
ble. With this, admission, we fee| 
that the Soviets have done an nn- 
iis..a!ly graceful thing' i>. allowing 
foreigners to examine the brain 
of the man they revere more dead

LOST
While decorating the Gymnasium 
last week ( for the Washington’s 
Birthday Dance a pockctknifc' was 
loaned to otic of the workers. Will 
this party please return tlie knife 
to M. B. Hudalc, Department of 
Architecture, sccond floor of Fine 
Arts Building, lie can be found there 
any night this week. Thanks.
In the Women’s Gymnasium a 
ladies’ pocketbook was lost last week 
by a night student while in the pool. 
The pocketbook contained the regis­
tration card, wrist watch and several 
other articles of value to the owner. 
It would be appreciated if the finder 
would return this lo the Receiving 
Room located in the Basement of 
Administration so that the property 
can.be restored to the owner.
DORMITORY ROOMS 
AVAILABLE FOR 
NIGHT STUDENTS
During the sccond term, sonic 
additional rooms in the men s 
dormitories arc available for night 
students. Twenty-three night me ft 
now live in the dormitories. Any­
one interested may sccurc informa­
tion on Monday evenings at the 
.office of the Dean of Men, Ad­
ministration Hall. The rate if 
$3.50 a week for a single room and 
$2.50 for: a double room, payahlc 
monthly in advance, with a ten 
dollar deposit returnable on with­
drawal from the dormitory.
The rooms are furnished, and the 
Institute provides light, heat, bed- 
linen, and . service. Three of the 
¡dormitories have outdoor sleeping 
porches. All of them have shower 
baths on each floor.
RECLAMATION OF RADIUM
Dr. Herman Schlundt, supervisor 
of the chemists at the University of 
Missouri, has perfected a process 
that has given rise to the only fac­
tory of it’s kind which exists in 
•the United Slates.
Dr. Schlundt’s methods have to 
do with the extradiction of the 
radium and mcsothorium 'contained 
in the various kinds of paint used 
on the faces of clocks and watches 
equipped with luminous dials. While 
only approxiiv ..I cly one one-hun­
dredth of an ounce of radium can 
be obtained 'froni several hundred 
pounds of the paints, the value of 
the time expended on such seem­
ingly uryequiting labor can be 
quickly appreciated when one con­
siders that this element cost the 
small I sum of seventy dollars a 
milligram, or approximately two 
million dollars an ounce.
The refining of the mcsothorium 
was commenced several years ago, 
and has already resulted in the ex­
traction of a large quantity of the 
substance. Last year, between 
twcnty-f|vc and fifty thousand dol­
lars worth of mcsothorium waa re­
fined, While mesot!horium costs 
slightly .more , than half as much as, 
radium, it can be readily seen that 
the salvaging of either' substance, 
can be made highly remunerative 
undertaking. McG.
ARCHEOLOGY NOTES
Workers digging in the pits ' at 
Dulobel, France, recently uncovered 
another skeleton of a prehistoric 
mammoth. The tusks of the ani­
mal are reported to have been 
seven (feet long, and it’s molars 
larger than paving blocks. Nice 
house pet, what? ,
The. district about Dulobel has 
long been known as a rich field for 
fossil and palentological specimen 
hunters that expect no greater re­
turn for their labors than the find­
ing of some part, however minute, 
of any prehistoric animal that ven­
tured into, the district centuries ago, 
and died a violent or natural death, 
depending on its pacifist tendencies.
This search for evidence which 
will influence the beliefs of the 
evolutionists and similar scientists 
has long been going on; in fact, 
since the scientists realized that a 
complete skelctonal specimen was 
a much more convincing argument 
than a long verbal discussion.
It is painfully true that man's 
knowledge of the past is not only | 
comparatively limited, but also very 
disconnected, while his knowledge 
of the future is positively nil. How-
Individual Pictures 
Of Night Students
For Thistle
The individual pictures of the 
night students who expect to finish 
thcir courscs this year for the 1931 
Thistle will be taken during the 
week of March 9 to 13 inclusive. 
They will be taken in Room 2 of 
Industries Building, and the settings 
will be made from 6:30 p. m. until 
10:00 p. in.
It is desired that every night stu­
dent who expects to finish a course

body to lhake a success of the ven­
ture and they will expect: yoy to do 
your part by reporting for sittings 
promptly during the time mentioned 
above. Make sure of your status as 
to finishing your course and then re­
port for the sitting.

DRY LAW “PERNICIOUS”
President Ernest Martin Hopkins 
of Dartmouth College recently ap­
plied the adjective "pernicious'' to 
“the whole theory of 'Jic Eighteenth 
Amendment.”
Dr. Hopkins, who for two years 
had refused to declare publicly bis 
attitude toward prohibition, broke 
his silence iii an 800-word letter to 
the National Temperance Council. 
He said he could not understand 
how "individuals or, organizations 
whose solicitude is for building up 
a spirit of temperance can continue 
cither to believe in or to support 
the theory or the practice of the 
Eighteenth Amendment." He- could 
not see that "advantage has accrued 
to. anybody, except possibly to in­
dustrial efficiency, in the enactment 
of the amendment and in the mass 
of legislation which has followed."
"Prohibition,” he said, "has made 
conditions worse than they were 
before and. has precluded the ac­
complishment of anything which 
partakes of the/',nature of a tem­
perance movement."
In his travels through the coun­
try, lie said, he found that "great 
.areas which used lo be wholly dry 
are now saturated not only with 
alcoholic liquors but with a spirit 
of complete abandon in regard to 
thcir control or 'use/'

Since the beginning of time, cooking has 
been a family affair—each family for itself; a 
potful at a time. But the past decade has seen 
a great change. The old family cooking pot 
has gone the way of the old oaken bucket. 
And in its place is a new American phenom­
enon: the twclve-billion-dollarpot.
In this pot, 55,000 factories are stewing and 
brewing and preparing most of your food ... 
and yours ;.. and yours—an annual produc­
tion of almost twelve billions of dollars.
These 5 5,000 plants~'represent America’s 
food industry. They are scattered throughout 
the nation. They make everything from canned 
foods to beverages, from ice cream to packed 
meats. But inevery one of ...........- uwumvilnm
them, a staff of 
technical experts 
is facing t-hc 
same problems 
of production, 
is working for a 
common cause:

CARNEGIE’S DON JUANS 
THINK THAT ALL DATES 
GROW ON TREES
Breathes there a Carnegie man 
whose soul is so' dead who never 
to himself has said, “It’s just 8 
bells . and the dance is at 9. 1
wonder if I’ve a chance to get a 
date ;at Linden.”
The last girls to leave the dorm 
on Friday and Saturday nights cer­
tainly do not believe that such a 
man could exist. At the rate the 
telephone rings, the last two hours 
before any dance, 15 operators and 
20 bellhops are needed. Some or­
ders come in for as high as five 
co-eds. What chances some men 
take! If only they knew what we 
look like, they might not call, 
“Will Mary, Susie or Sally please 
accompany them that evening?”
When any of us are lonesome 
and blue, top, all wc have to do 
(if we are in the mood, of course), 
is to sit on the steps beside the 
phone. Before long some daring 
youth with a sweet voice calls and 
only loo glad , to play Sir Gala- 
ad for the evening—provided wc: 
hand-him a very good line. Its a 
great life here in the dorm if you 
know how tr> talk over the tele­
phone.
Clans Make Plans 
For “Continent Day” 
To Be On March 14
Observance As Inaugurated 
Last Year Proves 
Successful
Several clans through the coun­
try are'formulating plans for ob­
serving "Across the Continent Clan 
Day” on Saturday, March 14. • This 
observance was inaugurated last 
year and involves the plan of hav­
ing all Carnegie Clans arrange 
meetings to be held on the same 
day. Last year it proved to be a 
splendid opportunity to - create en­
thusiasm and work. up the mem­
bership of individual clans.
Among, those who have already 
made plans' for meetings on this 
date are the Schenectadjr, the Pitts­
burgh, the Johnston, and the Can­
ton Clans. ...The meeting of the 
Schenectady Clan last-,.year was 
very successful, and it. is hoped that 
it will be even better this \-ear. 
Notices regarding this meeting will 
be sent out to-members of the clan 
and will- appear in the Tartan.
The Canton, Ohio, Clan, which 
has regular monthly meetings on 
the third Saturday of each month, 
has. moved thcir meeting date for­
ward to March 14, and are making 
a special effort to get a good turn­
out. Definite arrangements have 
not yet been completed, but the 
plans arc for a social evening oj 
indoor golf and dancing. As soon 
as the location is fixed, notices will 
be sent out to each-alumnus in the 
district. The committee is com­
posed ,of Mi’. Heffner, ^Chairman; 
Mr. Laca and-Mr. Berger.
But, what the Linden .sirens 
want to know^ is: “Who arc these 
leftover men — verdant Freshies, 
fresh Sophomores, ,or Know-it-all 
Juniors? They surely can’t be the 
Seniors. Everyone that calls seems 
well versed in the form of attack— 
never mutters or riiumbles, but just 
goes right ahead with his little, 
plea for a nice little girlie to go 
places and do things. People say 
that practice makes perfect, so that 
in a big way •excludes the Frosh. 
They must be those bounding 
Sophomores and those husky Jun­
iors who have the. nerve and the 
conceit to think Linden dames are 
anxiously 'waiting; in the. line at the 
phone for them to call at the last 
minute. We ‘should think that after 
so many refusals (for the girls 
are all dated weeks and weeks 
ahead, you know), they would stop 
calling. Evidently the whole Jim-

ALUMNI GROUPS
ORGANIZE CLANS
The Carnegie Tech Club, locat­
ed at 421 Fifth avenue, continues 
to increase its membership. The 
drive has been carried bn in an 
extensive form during the past two 
weeks, letters containing informa­
tion concerning the Club together 
with an application, blank having 
been sent to every CaVnegic T ech 
alumnus in the Pittsburgh district. 
It was discovered that numerous 
alumni who were not members of 
the Alumni Federation, and who, 
therefore, did not receivc the Car­
negie publications, were as yet ig­
norant of the fact that such an 
organization, as the> Carnegie Tech 
Club exists. However, there is no 
longer reason' for any resident 
graduate’s lack-of knowledge' con­
cerning the operation of the club.
In addition to this, each club 
member has received from the 
Membership Committee the names, 
addresses, and phone numbers of 
three prosperous members in his 
own class and approximate dis­
trict, whom he has been asked to 
contact and bring in at least one 
new member, reporting in each 
case the rcsfllts of, his efforts to 
the Membership Committee.
Dr. Thomas S. Baker has very 
kindly accepted the invitation to 
address the club on “Clan Da}-,” 
Saturday, March 14. The club has 
extended an invitation to Faculty 
members and alumni , who arc not 
members of the Club to attend the 
celebration on March 14. The 
Social" Committee has arranged to 
have lunchcon begin at one o’clock. 
More information concerning “Clan 
Day” will be announced later.
Johnstown
This week wc are welcoming' 
into our clan group the re-organ­
ized Johnstown Clan. Through 
the efforts of Miss Emma Bell 
Hauch, M’24, a meeting was called 
of Carnegie Tech alumni residing 
in Johnstown and vicinity, at the 
Central High School on February 
24. At this time plans were made 
for another meeting for organiza­
tion purposes to be held early this 
week. Officers will be elected 
and plans made for a general 
meeting on March 14, in connec­
tion with the “Across the Conti­
nent Clan Day” movement. As 
the plans now stand for March 14, 
the meeting will take the form of 
a dinner at the Capitol Hotel, to 
be followed by bridge and five 
hundred. Miss Hauch, 515 Grove 
Street, may be reached for com­
plete details of the affair. This 
group is going to put the Johns­
town C. I. T. alumni on the map. 
All alumni and former students 
are invited to join this organiza­
tion, and help make it one of the 
outstanding clans.
Akron
Word has just been received 
from T. Barry Gotham that he 
has gotten in touch with about 
forty of the C. I. T. Alumni in 
and around Akron,-Ohio, regarding 
a party tb be held in conjunction 
with the plans for an “Across the

Club on March 3, at which time, 
arrangements were made to hold

will be dinner,' dancing and bridge, 
and the committee is endeavoring 
to keep the admission price as low 
as $2 per person. Further infor­

Northcrn New Jersey Clan
On January 26 the Northern New 
Jersey clan held a most successful 
meeting at the Wilkins Coffee 
Shop, 7 West Park street, New­
ark. N. ,1. The feature of the eve­
ning was the présentation of three 
reels of motion ^ic.tures of the 1930 -football games ,and some 
shots taken around the campus. 
The meeting was attended by 
quite a number *of alumni who; 
have just recently moved into the 
district.
The Clan is planning on only 
one more meeting this spring, 
which is to be a larger parly than 
any . which have been attempted in 
several years, and as plans arc 
already in progress for this party, 
the Clan officers feel that a meet­
ing on March 14 would not be ad­
visable. The Clan, however, wishes 
to send its hearty greetings to the 
other .groups planning meetings, 
and to say that they think thcyidea 
of an “Across the Continent Clan 
Day” a splendid one. Mr. R. 1.. 
Krcidler, secretary of the clan, will 
send out further details of the 
spring party in the near future.

THE AMERICAN EDUCATION
An American professor ohco 
said, perhaps not altogether scri-. 
ously, that after 20 years of teach­
ing he had come to the conclu­
sion that the student's mind had 
infinite resources in evading the in­
troduction of knowledge. Recently 
Count Kcyserling told us that “No 
culture comes from a United Stales' 
education,” Then Dr. Maurer, a

Examinations
It has been the custom, for the past several semesters, of 
some of the departments and instructors to exceed the time limit on quizzes and examinations. This practice is especially 
noticeable during final exams. Most finals are three hours in 
duration and certainly that is. ample time for an instrfictor to determine ju^t.how much a student knows about his subject. 
There is no necessity for giving' an exam that requires four or 
even five hours for a student to complete. Three hours of concentrated mental work is hard enough on a student, and 
when he is forced to spend an hour or more overtime and then, perhaps, take another exam the same day it is little wonder 
that so many re-examination’s are necessary.
The math department uses the theory that it takes a stu­
dent four times as long to complete a givfch set of questions as is does an instructor. This theory might lie adapted and fol­
lowed by a number of other departments in the school. An instructor with any experience, whatsoever, should be able \.o 
judge rather closely the length of an, exam, and should give one 
that could readily lie completed in tlie allotted time.
Some of the departments extend the time limit when it 
is noticed that the majority of the students arc unable to com­plete an exam in the scheduled lime, but such a procedure 
would be1 Unnecessary if the examination was made up wjlh regard to time as well as thoroughness. If the four to one ratio, 
mentioned above, is adopted il should also be followed. Wc defy anyone, even the math instructors, to work out some of the 
finals in forty-live minutes.
Mid-West Conference
. Carnegie Tech will be honored this week when il will act 
as host for the annual meeting of the Mid-West Student Con­
ference. Tim ‘organization has been functioning for several years and has accomplished niucl^ in the way of aiding student 
activities. The sessions of the conclave, which begin Thursday, will be held in the Union and will be open lo the entire student >ody. Students will not, however, be permitted to enter into 
the discussions.
The meetings of this organization will, no doubt, be inter­
esting and instructive, and the student body might do well to take advantage of the opportunity to learn what; other schools 
are doing and thinking. Lack of interest by the students in affairs of their school is the principle reason why so many 
traditions have passed on in the'‘last few years. A revival in this matter would be most welcome.
More English Needed
Until recently the technical student has been criticized be­cause of his inability to write down his thoughts and ideas, us­ing correct English so that the meaning of his writings would be clear.
This fault has been partly corrected with the introduction 
of courses in English and subjects in which the •writing of let­ters, papers and reports is required. But even now practically no thought or time is given to the technical man’s obvious 
need of the ability to .speak out his thoughts in a manner that will enlighten and impress his listeners. In a class room the 
student .displays a lack of clarity and'coherence in the explan ation of a theory or' process. He expresses himself in short, 
, iialting phrases and incomplete sentences which can be under­stood only with great difficulty. Out of the class-room, in a 
discussion or when making an extemporaneous speech, he finds himself at a loss for words and powerless to convey his ideas to his audience.
It is probably impractical to add a course in public speak­ing to an already .over-crowded engineer’s .schedule, but some 
arrangement could be made, whereby the student would make oral reports often, paying some attention to his delivery. He 
could be encouraged to take a more active part iii discussions by the organization of informal discussion luncheons and by a 
more widespread use of seminars and colloques. With a greater mastery of spoken English, his technical education would be of 
greater value to himself and others. . J. S. C.
Howdy, You All!
The next presentation, ladies and 
gentlemen, also scholars, will be by 
Bill Bryant and his boys, when next 
Friday evening they offer the 1931 
Inter-fraternity Formal, embellished 
with absolutely the latest things in 
orchestra and appointments. The 
orchestra, Danl Gregory’s, must be 
one of the latest things, as nobody 
ever' heard of . them before. They 
do say, however, that the band is 
well-known in the South, where music 
is really appreciated. If the favors 
arc, as distinctive as las| year's, the 
dance will be a success, as for as 
the ladies arc concerncd.
The sister performance to the 
Inter-fraternity took placc -Friday 
night when the Tcch sororities held 
thcir annual dinner dahcc at the P. 
A. A. Not having an invitation, nor 
able to get a job as a waiter, this 
person was not present, but , those 
that know said it was a smooth party. 
Draw your own conclusions.
The basketball squad is back home 
after an Eastern trip that was suc­
cessful in everything except bask'et- 
ball. Nobody car.es, hoivcver, about 
those three games, lost to the strong­
est teams in the East. The team has 
already won more games Ilian the 
last turn. or three Tech teams put 
together. The boys all had a good 
lime, il seems, except Dob Smith, 
who strained the¦ ligaments in his 
ankle, causing his basketball demise 
for the remainder of the season, pci•• 
haps. That is a tough break for- the 
boy. who was leading scorer of the 
team. Il is tougher on Ihc tcqm.
George Nease .and Jim. Fergus sat 
down near "bald-headed” row for a 
performance of “Girl Crazy." "Big 
Train” Armentrout and “Mickey^ Mc- 
Guirc sat not so near Ihc. front for 
"The New Yorkers.” The Hollywood 
Restaurant provided considerable en­
tertainment for some of the boys. 
Not -being accustomed to boat rides, 
some of the team rode back and 
forlh several times on the Hudson 
river ferry. Jimmy Leonard liked 
New York so well that after the 
final game in Philadelphia, lie' re­
turned'to the Big Town for a couple 
of days,
While wailing for the West Point 
train in Jersey City the boys had 
their palms read on a penny machine. 
Armentrout and Bert Munhall couldn’t 
gel a reading, for some reason or 
other. It must have been beyond the 
capacity of llie machine.
It seems this column was full of 
mistakes last week. ^laybc I’m get­
ting old. The frosh did hold a ban­
quet about three weeks ago at Web­
ster Hall. They were very distinctive, 
having thirty-four guests present, for 
the Class of 1934! The Sophomores 
didn’t know anything about it, ap­
parently, nor even the majority of 
tin:, freshmen. Tradition was upheld, 
however.
Another mistake was the spelling 
of George llcola’s name, which was 
expressed as Ikalo. It doesn’t sound 
much different either way, hut
George objects. Highbergcr didn’t
fight Thiel, from Syracuse, hut won
the decision over Machcncr, who 
wasn't named after a college. Thiel 
was beaten by Ducanis. Beg pardon I

Since it is felt that not all stu­
dents in lhe school have wide cir 
clcs of friends among the various 
departments, a social committee bus 
been established to foster a mbn 
wide spread fratcrnalism and facili­
tate the making of fresh acquaint­
ances.
The chief, purpose of the Arts 
Ball is to display the inventiveness 
and resourcefulness of the students 
and to form tliose interested in the 
arts into a more solid body. This 
function and its purpose has the 
entire approval of Dean Green and 
Dean' Tarbcll, is enthusiastically 
supported by Dean lvecblc of the 
College of Fine Arts and has th- 
co-opcration of the faculty.
The committee in charge of the 
ball consists of: chairman, H. J.
Brennan; treasurer, V. S. Broom- 
liall; decorations, Ralph Kruck; 
music, Willibald Ryshanek; social, 
Betty Ncelly; publicity, Fred Hoyt;

“Why Not a Marriage Institute?
It’s Very Practical,” Says Prof.
Wc note, in an exchange college 
publication, that Professor Soandso 
wilf soon ’indulge a few, of his pet 
theories by opening an "Institute 
For Marriage and Family Guid­
ance." The course is open to all 
students who arc in earnest about 
the course and has no prerequisites» 
of any • kind. One doesn't even 
have to sport a "¿old band" to be 
admitted. One doesn't have to un­
dergo the admitted trials of -holy 
matrimony to take- a coursc guar­
anteed to find out what's wron^ 
with marriage, for the chances are 
that those already "hooked” could 
tell plenty on this subjcct.
The courses arc varied in sub­
ject, and deal with all phases of 
married life—from the lccturc tell­
ing how to camouflage burned bis­
cuits, to that dealing with the in­
tricacies of the budget.1
Such a coursc is not only novel 
and arresting; *it is more than that, 
it is extremely practical, and no 
doubt the graduates of that school 
will found happier homes than if 
they had gone into the pYob.lcm
ignorantly and unaided by experi­
ence of any -kind. There’s only
one more course that we’d like 
suggest as an addition, and
that’s one dealing with the' mothcr- 
law. Custom has built for her 
a little scat .conviently- placed in 
back of the couple ahead, but cus­
tom haá as yet devised 110 method' 
for regulating dr prohibiting'- war­
fare between the. “in-laws” and the 
“already-ins!”
Carnegie is far famed , as a tech­
nical school, but it can never 1 be 
entirely modern until it bcéomcs 
cognizant of the fact that marriage 
is just as important a career as
secretaryship or social work. Al­
though there are- classcs in home 
management being given now', there 
still remains the psychological cle­
ment to be considered and if at 
least one of the couple Were thor­
oughly versed^ in "The Psychology 
of the Wife Who Works;” the 
ensuing strife would -be alleviated 
to a* great degree.
Statistics arc dry things at best 
and there arc always a dishearten­
ing number of exceptions to "every 
rule—all except the rule that about 
half the graduates of any college 
marry two years after graduation, 
and that the majority of the re­
maining cclibatcs succumb sooner 
or later. You, gentle reader, even 
you will some day ,bc a- "ball and 
.¿chain/’ you, too, will have a "white 
.elephant, a someone you dearly 
love and can’t get along without, 
but who’s always in the way." 
That he or that she may not be a 
literal white clcphanc,. wc. urge the 
installation- of sufcli a coursc in all 
far-seeing institutions. The course 
.would be open to. college- students 
and outsiders—and there would be 
enough variety so that Betty Co­
ed, who has not ceascd to, be fas­
cinated and thrilled bysthc sparkle 
of her ring, may not be forccd to 
attend classcs dealing with "How 
to Keep a Husband,” nor should 
staid old Mrs. Whoosis 1)e com­
pelled to' come to the class' of 
“Bride's Cookery.” No, the courses' 
would be widely varied, and taught 
by profs of experience, without 
degrees, perhaps, but with some­
thing mfiiiitcly greater—the achieve­
ment of Success,
Three chccrs for Professor So­
andso; may his venture succeed, 
and may the custom grow in pop­
ularity. T
Think It Over!
There arc almost insurmountable difficulties in trying to teach large 
numbers of.students in crowded class rooms, where there is little oppor­
tunity for personal contact between the teacher and tlie individual stu­
dent.—Everett Dean Martin.
With the exception of -one Japanese, none of the students whom I 
happened to know took the slightest interest in tile' subject. I had 
hoped that there might be opportunity, so essential in philosophy above 
all other studies, for some direct play of mind between my bwn uh- 
instructcd one and that of the instructor. Th'cre never wai The pto- 
fessor was a mere unapproachable -oral textbook. Nevertheless he had 
the illusion that study “under him” had induced sonic play of mind 
among his novel-rcadcrs, and for that reason he used to give out the 
examination questions at the year’s end s'o that the student might give
original thought to them. Five of my friends Avcre amo'ng the novftl-
readers. Having paid 110 attention to the coursc the entire year, they
got me to sit under the ^pple trees at Ik Marvel’s place, and for a
couple of afternoons before the examinations 1 talked over the probable 
questions with them. They all pas'scd, with higher marks, I 'believe, 
that 1 did myself, and received Yale's imprimatur that they Were 
proficient in philosophy.
Not long agb I asked a well-known professor at one of- the largest 
and best-known Eastern universities what, in hi’s candid opinion, his 
university did for the thousands of students who annually attended it. 
After a moment’s thought he said that as far as he could sec, tlie uni­
versity turned out a standardized, low-grade mental product, much like 
an intellectual Ford factory.—Janies Truslow Adams.
The new education must be something different from the technology 
which today is supplanting an out-worn classical tradition. It must be 
an adventurous quest for meaning and for that which is important, a 
disposition to think things though similar in spirit to that which once 
created classical education and gave it vitality. That education today 
has so generally accepted the subordinate position assigned to it by the 
ulitariati interest is, 1 think, a result of the confusion of educators as 
lo their task at the time we entered the industrial age. It is" absiird 
to suppose, that intellectual leadership will be permanently left behind 
in an industrial civilization which is itself, in tlie long run, a product ,of 
intelligence. The time must come when educators, . instead of trying 
meekly to mc<it any demand the public may* make upon them, will have 
something to ¿ay on their own account. And instead of giving all thcir 
attention to service, pedagogical methods, and administration detail they 
will again approach thcir task in a philosophical spirit. Many people 
now see the need, not :>i some new educational trick, but of a well- 
considered philosophy of education. I am thinking of the ancient Greeks 
who also felt the need. Perhaps we of the Western World are just 
beginning to be civilized.—E. D. Martin.
Whether a democracy can last is problematic, but it is certain that 
it cannot last if there arc no leaders‘above the general level. How are 
wc to train them? Is it by training men solely for a particular calling— 
mcdicihc, “engineering, running’ a locomotive, or laundering collars? Or 
are wc to give, to some at least, an education in which doing is sub­
ordinate to being, in which the development of intelligence and char­
acter shall be held superior tb passing an examination in philosopln' 
after reading novels for nine months, or learning how to truss and 
dress poultry?
It all conics back, like most tilings, to the question of values—of 
what is worth while, of what is‘the good life. Should we learn French 
in order to impress the boss? Should we pick up scraps from collec? 
tions of the classics in order to make a hit at Airs. Jones’ party and 
impress her guests? One of the most sympathetic*, of foreign critics 
and observers of American life, a man who has spent much time among 
us, recently. said that one feeling, he always had here was that, all our 
goods were in our shop windows and there was nothing behind. -1 be­
lieve this, criticism is all too true. We are so busy doing..that we have 
no time to be. We have almost forgotten what it is to be. We all 
have motor cars but 110 place to go.- At present what we .need above 
all else in America is education-—not the infinitely variegated supply of 
courses that make a college catalogue look like Sears-Roebuck's, but a 
liberal education that will enable us to create a scale of values for our 
experience and to take a philosophical attitude toward the complex 
reality about us.
We have been "doing” for three hundred years. We have cleared 
and settled a continent. We have accumulated the most colossal store 
of material power and resources the' world has ever seen. Is it not 
time that we began to think what '.o do with all our means, what the 
end is that we wish to attain? Arc we forever to continue getting 
things, more things in order to get more things with which to get more 
things and so 6n ad infinitum? AVe arc forever to seek the means with­
out' ever considering the end for,'.which wc seek them? Is there any 
sense in doing if we arc never to become something, to be- something, 
as a result? The entire practical life' in America urges us to do un­
ceasingly and unthinkingly. Should it not be otic of the chief functions 
of education-to find the strands of meaning in our ccasclcss web-of do­
ing and to tcach us some purpose in our lives? Can anything give 11s 
that purpose better than culture, in the sense defined above? Can that 
culture be attained by “a1 liberal education” that permits ‘‘business'or­
ganization,” fire insurance,” "business psychology,” or. personnel ad­
ministration” to be substituted at the whim of the student of literature, 
art, or philosophy?—J. T. Adams.

THE MIKADO
(Continued from Pace One)
In this presentation of a bit of 
burlcsqucric one wilj see the gentle­
men of Japan‘Step from thcir placc 
"on many a screen and fan, and 
many a vase and jar,” wjiere they 
figure in lively paint to the stage 
of the Little Theater, impersonated 
by a number .of the vocal students.
Sir William Schwcnk Gilbert who 
wrote the libretto of the "Mikado” 
which was first presented in 1885 
has won his rights to the title of 
the reviver of humor 011 the Eng­
lish stage and its greatest comic 
dramatist during the nineteenth cen­
tury not by his comcdics hut by his 
operas. Gilbert’s librettos to. which 
Sullivan fitted his music arc as de­
lightful on the stage today as they 
were forty or fifty years ago, and 
thcir incomparable nonsense may still 
he enjoyed by a tone deaf reader. 
Then, there should be a great deal 
of enjoyment in the "Mikado" for 
everyone, for those, who do not care 
for the music will undoubtedly find 
pleasure’in the humor of the lines. 
v Since there will be only enough 
tickets for the evening performances 
tb ’supply faculty demands and per­
haps a few persons 011 the drama 
department list,. it will be impossible 
for students to attend these perform­
ances. However, in order that stu­
dents may sec the presentation, there 
will be a spccial matinee for stu­
dents 011 Friday afternoon.
Y. M. C. A.
(Continued from Page One) 
will be held. Instead of the usual 
corn rbast; which was . held this 
year, in Frick's Woods, the fresh­
men will be . taken to a camp 
located nearby over Saturday night.
It was hoped, last jrcar that, such 
a procedure could be instituted, but 
the .“Y” organization was unable to 
back it financially. Many colleges 
of the country hold camps for 
incoming freshmen, and the camp 
idea lias been acclaimed a success 
by all the colleges . which hold 
them..
The possibilities of holding a 
retreat with the Women’s Cabinet 
in the near futprc will also be 
considered. A retreat will be 
something new for both cabinets, 
for one . has not been. held for 
several years.

THE PUBLIC NUISANCE
Feminine Education A Flop? ?
The Public Nuisance has been 
making some ‘observations, the past 
few years and has. concluded that 
higher education for women is all' 
wrong. It has resulted in -a status 
that strive as1 lie .might," lie ' is un­
able “to point with pride 'jo,^ and 
is rather forced to use that other- 
verbal -‘outlet of .harassed editorial 
writers—"view with .alarm.’’;
Why docs the Public .Nuisance 
say all this? Wliy docs- lie be­
lieve that feminine higher educa­
tion-is a flop?
Well, first ' df iil1, mdsf' -of the 
higher educated females- ofa his ac- 
quajiitancsVa^e unhappy.-: Tlfcyliave 
developed- too many vague long­
ings ;;'tliby hive developed-standards 
which,; to. speak frankly, are. -mat­
rimonially unattainable. They have 
pointed thcir arrows to - the sky, 
when the .targets are barely able to 
clear the ground, let alone ..squirm 
through the morass of average 
masculinit}'. - -
T he average . educated woman . is 
too go’od for the average educated 
man. A B'.’A. ¡'in. feminine eugen- 
ically ; minded' hands ; is "'unsatisfied 
with a similar Bachclor- of Arts in 
the male;' she demands at* 'the very 
least a Ph.D., or bdttcr an M.D. 
or LL.D. What; happens „then to 
our female Ph.D’s? They" lose 
thcir masculine entanglements vol­
untarily, gradually atrophy 'emotion­
ally, and finish by raising guinea 
pigs instead of babic^. But they're 
not happy.
Another thing—take your moder­
ately educated woman — she who 
liffs o,nly had four years of college 
with perhaps a summer session or 
two sneaked..in at Columbia or 
Cornell. What happens to her? 
She, poor creature,., has developed 
enough of discrimination unfor- 
natcjy to look at eligible men with 
the same point of view that she 
looked at a frog’s kidneys in biol­
ogy. Goodness knows, the balance 
between men as they really arc 
and as a glamorous post-ado.lcsccnt 
observes them is slender enough 
without being able to bear the 
added weight of a little feminine 
analysis. Rcstilt—Johnny. Doe, who 
would just be the las*t word in 
feminine dreams of a. high school 
graduate — bccomcs utterly impos­
sible to the maiden who wears a 
sheepskin 011 her wall. But the 
B.A. girl, also, is not too Happy.’
Tlie trouble is not alone that “a 
little learning is a dangerous thing” 
but 'that it is apt to be downright 
fatal. A certain amount: of knowl-

THE AMERICAN EDUCATION
(Continued from Parc Four) 
shouldered boys in, wh7 egc classes 
arc more, interested in) boy scout 
stuff than in education; while 
freshman girls haven’t gotten over 
thcir fondness for dolls."
Such indictments and many more 
of their kind caii be met rather 
easily by those who still maintain 
a vestige of faith in American 
higher education. Let it first be 
understood »that quite frequently 
some individuals malfe startling 
statements concerning education, 
or anything else, to satisfy a cer­
tain front page complex, as it 
were.
The fact that one 'out of one 
hundred fifty people are receiving 
a higher education here today, as 
opposed to one out of a thousand 
a generation ago, has assuredly 
tended to decrease the enrollment 
of only the sclcct. The standards 
of scholarship, and perhaps cul­
ture, have undoubtedly suffered 
somewhat bccause of it. The logi­
cal conclusion is that brainy schol­
ars arc common enough to Amer­
ican colleges'and universities, but 
they arc apparently surounded by 
a larger percentage of average 
students than was the ease for­
merly or elsewhere. On the 
other hand our well-filled institu­
tions arc providing a scholastic 
training to a large share of the 
proletariat.

their natural mating instincts and 
instead attempt to rationalize thcir 
conjugal partners — a procedure 
which considering'--the absolute-o 
even relative amount of- thcir 
knowledge is^ absolutely slaughter­
ing to any young love affair.
The higher educated woman looks 
at the I.Q. of ihc male, instead of 
his S.A. The Public Nuisance is 
well aware that .plenty .of mistakes 
arc made by damsels who .qarc 
more for the shape of a boy's head 
than what’s inside it, and yet lie is 
old fashioned citoiigh to bclrevfc that 
Ma Nature is still a. step alv*ad of 
any half-baked, psychological. *C.'C 
or laboratory standard of intel­
ligence. He feels that the average 
girl will retain chough of thfc'bld 
selective instinct, if she is unham­
pered by the tightening bonds of a 
higher education, to perform „very 
successfully in selecting a suitable 
mate:
