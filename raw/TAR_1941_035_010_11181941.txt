Army Scenes To 
Be Used As Motif 
For Decorations
Interfraternity Council will pre­
sent something new in Interfrater­
nity Informals this Friday night 
from 9:00 to 1:00 A. M. Fran Eichler 
and his orchestra will play for a 
dance that promises to be one of 
the year’s attractions.
A former graduate of the Car­
negie Tech Music Department, Fran 
Eichler will feature the voices of 
Rita Seaman, Will Ashey, and nov­
elties by Sonny Faigen. Eichler is 
the composer of his own theme song 
“Goodnight, Little Girl” and has in­
troduced several song hits such as 
•‘You’re Lettin’ the Grass Grow Un­
der Your Feet.” The eleven piece 
orchestra is a very danceable band 
having broadcast over coast-to-coast 
network stations, played at other 
college dances, and also was en­
gaged at such well known Pitts­
burgh night spots as the Schenley 
Hotel and Kennywood Park.
In keeping with the spirit of Na­
tional Defense Week, Interfraternity 
Council is using defense as the 
theme of the dance. The entire 
gymnasium will be converted into 
an army camp with twelve barracks 
—one representing each fraternity, 
a guard house, barbed-wire fences 
and other army paraphernalia plus 
a gigantic American flag that will 
cover the entire ceiling of the gym 
and will complete the army theme. 
Special lighting will increase the 
effect of the decorations. Refresh­
ments will be served in a typical 
army mess hall to be constructed 
at one end of the gym.
During the evening the fraterni­
ties will sing their own songs, and 
to add to the entertainment nov­
elty dances will be held. Special 
espionage agents posing as dancers 
will select the best dance teams 
and defense stamps will be award­
ed as prizes.
Dave Ross, ’43, social chairman 
of Interfraternity Council, announc­
ed that the dance will be closed— 
only fraternity- actives- and -pledges 
and alumni can attend.

Last week, we traced the history 
of inter-collegiate football'from its 
inception on the campus in 1906 to 
Dr. Doherty’s arrival as President 
of the Institution in the fall of 1936.
President Doherty, in his report 
to the Alumni on October 29, 1937, 
said of the athletic situation: “I
would say at the outset that of all 
the problems I have dealt with since 
coming to Carnegie Tech, this one 
has been, by all odds, the most com­
plex. Its ramifications cover the 
range from the philosophy of ama­
teurism to student eligibility, from 
student and alumni esprit de corps 
to inter-collegiate relationships and 
large scale business operations. I 
confess that although. I. was not 
mindful of other problems in' this 
realm, it was the financial prob­
lem that pressed me to take on the 
burden of studying with the Trus­
tees, our way out of the situation, 
notwithstanding the fact that in my 
first year here there were a suffi­
cient number of other problems to 
keep me occupied.”
Administration Assumes Control
One of the first steps taken by 
President Doherty was to replace 
the Athletic Council with the De­
partment of .Intercollegiate Ath­
letics. This change placed all in- 
ter-Collegiate sports directly under 
the Administration’s control. The 
school now hired the coaches and 
administrative staff ' and approved 
the budget of the Department, re­
sponsibilities which were formerly 
under the supervision of the Ath­
letic Council. Buddy Overend, 
who had held the position of Grad­
uate Manager of Athletics under the 
old plan, was appointed Head of the 
Department of Inter-collegiate Ath­
letics and this new Department was 
supported by funds of the Institu­
tion in balanced relation to other 
educational and recreational enter­
prises.
It must be remembered that al­
though this new department re­
placed the old Athletic Council, 
there were still many athletes who 
had come to Tech with the Council’s 
promise that they would receive a 
i four-year education without cost to 
them. President Doherty stated, in 
1936, that the school would live up 
to the Athletic Council’s obliga­
tion, and that all of these students 
would be kept in school, under the 
provisions of the original agree­
ment, until graduation.
However, beginning with 1937, 
President Doherty further stated 
that any athlete who had come to 
Tech with the intention of playing 
football must have had his financial 
arrangements made through the 
Walter P. Steffen Memorial Fund. 
In 1937, Bill Kern’s first year as 
head football coach here 16 Fresh­
men entered Tech, through con­
tributions made to the Steffen Fund 
by alumni and friends. Six more 
men came in the following year but 
in 1939 and 1940 there was only 
enough money remaining in the 
Fund to pay the tuition of the men 
who had come in the previous 
years, which made further aid to 
athletes impossible.
Doherty’s Policies
We have often heard, in student 
discussions, of the “Doherty Plan,” 
or of President Doherty’s football 
policy. What are his actual state­
ments on the football situation? 
Quoting again from the President’s 
report to the Alumni in 1937, we 
find the following statements which 
should do much to clear up the cur­
rent misunderstanding as to just 
what President Doherty’s policies 
are:
“In the first place, Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology is, before all 
else, an educational institution. Sec­
ondly, we are not interested in pro­
viding public entertainment as a 
business or in publicity that might 
come from extraordinary athletic 
prowess. Third, we are possessed 
of no missionary spirit in this mat­
ter; we are not out to reform the 
world. Fourth, we are adamant in 
maintaining high standards in 
scholastic and athletic eligibility 
and in admission requirements and 
in preventing, after the termination 
of our transition period in 1940, the 
use of the institution’s funds to pay 
or support in any way our ath­
letes because they are athletes; but 
I take it we are on defensive 
grounds when we profess no desire 
to police the theory of amateurism 
to impossible limits—to attempt to 
prevent the inevitable. If an alum­
nus or friend wants to help a boy 
through college because he excels as 
a scholar, a musician, or an athlete, 
or for any other reason, there is yet 
to be demonstrated, so far as my 
knowledge goes, an^ffective way of 
PG.E5.BCI G. UlOC D
Have you heard about Bagga? 
If you have, good! If you haven’t 
why haven’t you, and why don’t 
you read Freckles? Slacker! Lil’ 
Abner isn’t the only man in the 
newspaper—there’s always Super­
man, but he ain’t my type—Freckles, 
popularized the “Boys and Girls Get 
Acquainted” movement.
Alpha Chi Alpha, women’s lit­
erary honorary, is planning a really 
crowded tea dance for Thursday in 
Thistle Hall at 4:30. Price per per­
son is twenty-five cents plus tax 
plus a desire to Bagga a man or 
vice versa.
Instead of a corny three-piece 
band or bagpipes, Alpha Chi Alpha 
is giving lucky patrons the very 
unusual treat of music by every 
band in the land. You don’t have to 
be literarily inclined, you don’t have 
to read Freckles — honest — you 
don’t even have to read. Just come.

At the Carnegie Day exercises 
next Tuesday, Tau Beta Pi, the na­
tional Engineering honorary, will 
call to its ranks three Juniors, and 
a group of Seniors. To be eligible 
for membership a student must be 
in the upper fifth of the Senior 
class, or the upper tenth of the 
Junior class. Men are called be­
cause of high scholarship, partici­
pation in activities, and outstand­
ing character. Each fall and spring 
the society holds interviews to 
which it invites the scholastically 
eligible men. During the past week 
these interviews have been con­
ducted, and the results will be an­
nounced in the near future.
The three Juniors who are chosen 
every fall are designated as the 
Honor Juniors. These three are 
elected in the spring of their Jun­
ior year to the executive positions 
of the fraternity. The present of­
ficers are Arthur Handlos, Presi­
dent; Robert Beck, Vice President; 
and Robert McBride, Treasurer.
The society is quite prominent 
nationally, being known as the en­
gineering Phi Beta Kappa. The 
Tech Gamma chapter is very ac­
tive. Among the year’s activities 
is the sponsoring of assemblies, and 
the publishing of a special issue 
of the Technical. In addition to 
this the fraternity lends invaluable 
assistance to many students by 
tutoring them free of charge.
“Y” Meeting Thursday
All freshmen students who are 
candidates for either the men’s Y- 
cabinet or women’s C. W. C. A. 
cabinet will meet with the upper- 
class cabinet members of the Y. M, 
C. A. and C. W. C. A. at the Car­
negie Union this Thursday evening 
at 7:30.
A full program is planned, begin­
ning with a short round table dis­
cussion. It will also include a so­
cial program and refreshments. 
Reverend George Wright, a student 
of Theology, will lead the discus­
sion.
Noted Aeronautics 
Head To Present 
Alumni Greetings
It has been the custom every year 
at Founder’s Day to invite one of 
the prominent Carengie Tech 
alumni to give the greetings of the 
alumni body to the students. This 
year the man chosen to tender the 
address is Mr. James Howard Kin­
delberger, President of North 
American Aviation, Inc., and a 
member of the class of 1920.
Following his talk to the student 
body, he will be the guest speaker 
at the Carnegie Day banquet held 
annually on this date by the 
alumni association. His speech will 
be “Aviation and National Defense.” 
His many years of experience in the 
field of aviation, and his present 
prominent position make the choice 
of this timely topic very apropos.
Mr. Kindelberger was born in 
Wheeling, W. Va., in 1895. He early 
started on his industrial career, 
quitting high school after attending 
for only a year to get a job with 
the National Tube Company. Two 
years later found, him a draftsman 
and inspector for the United States 
Army Engineering Corps. He held 
this position till 1916 when he suc­
cessfully pased the entrance ex­
aminations and enrolled in the En­
gineering school at Tech. His col­
lege career was, however, short­
lived, for in 1917 he entered the 
army. There he spent six months 
in civil engineering and later trans- 
fered to the Army Air Service.
Alter the Armistice, he joined the 
Glenn Martin Company and became 
chief draftsman and assistant chief 
engineer to Donald W.' Douglass— 
then Glenn Martin’s chief engineer. 
When Douglass formed his own 
company in 1925, he took Mr. Kin­
delberger with him in the capacity 
of chief engineer. In 1934, Mr. Kin­
delberger was invited to become the 
president of the General Aviation 
Manufacturing Corp. at Baltimore, 
Md. At that time General Avia­
tion was. a subsidiary of North 
American Aviation, Inc., and when 
in 1935, it was dissolved, Mr. Kin­
delberger was appointed President 
of North American Aviation which 
he has since developed into one of 
the nation’s largest aircraft manu­
facturing organizations.
United Fund Drive 
May Reach Quota
United Fund on the campus may 
just barely reach its. quota for 1941 
if the students and faculty who 
haven’t been contacted, will send in 
their contributions. Breakdown of 
the figures show that contributions 
averaged 79c per day school stu­
dent. Faculty solicitations were 
much higher; the mean contribution 
being $10.95 per person. Evening 
school averages were low, since all 
students were not aproached. De­
ficit for the present fund is $253, 
but Mr. Shaffer, who is on. the 
United Fund Committee, feels sure 
that the school’s quota of $5,200 will 
be reached.
All those who wish to contribute 
or increase their former contribu­
tions can do so at the cashier’s of­
fice. Students whose pledges fall 
due on November 22 are asked to 
make remittance at the cashier’s of­
fice.

In line with present' prepared­
ness policies, the faculty and stu­
dent body- are forming a Tech De­
fense Committee. Councils of the 
various campus organizations have 
been considering the problems in­
volved in an organization of this 
kind. Suggestions coming from 
these various groups have been un­
der two headings. First, to make 
the student aware of the specific 
problems that are existant in the 
world; and secondly, to instruct the 
students in methods of taking care 
of emergency situations.
President of the Faculty Asso­
ciation appointed a Faculty Com­
mittee on Defense under the chair­
manship of M. T. Chworowsky, 
Associate Professor of Psychology 
and Education. This organization 
has been sparking the campus de­
fense discussions, but the initiative 
will be taken over by the joint 
council when it meets Thursday at 
4:30.
Students asked to serve on the 
committee were chosen from the 
representative organizations on the 
campus. Major problem of the new 
group is cooperation of the coun­
cil with the City Defense Com-
Dr. 8GYCoE 3, 4G1CoEr
mission. Experience obtained from 
European fronts is being assimilat­
ed and used on these preparedness 
programs. Air-raid wardens must 
be appointed, first aid men instruct­
ed, and volunteer firemen trained. 
These duties- do not come under the 
jurisdiction of any fighting forces 
and must be taken care of by vol­
unteers. The new Tech council is 
interested in these and also morale- 
building. Under their auspices first 
aid classes will be started on the 
campus.
The Faculty Commission is trying 
to have the cashier’s office made a 
post where defense bonds may be 
bought. Faculty members will be 
shown how they can save money 
on income taxes by investing in 
the bonds.
Conservation of materials, a vital 
defense necessity, will be consid­
ered by the new preparedness coun­
cil. To awaken a political conscious­
ness in the students, discussion 
groups are going to be formed on 
the campus. These will be begun 
in fraternities, dormitories, and 
other campus organizations. The 
organization is still in an embryonic 
state and will welcome suggestions 
for its programs.
Andy’s Dream
Machine Shop Trains 
Men For Defense
By Walter Haller
When Andrew Carnegie founded 
the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology in 1903, ho did. so with the 
purpose of providing training for 
the sons of working men, that they 
might take their places in industry 
as useful citizens. As the institu­
tion he started grew, the subject 
matter of its course naturally ex­
panded to the point where more ad­
vanced engineering studies forced 
shops and laboratory courses 
further and further Into the back­
ground.
So it was that the machine shop, 
which once occupied a most promi­
nent position near the entrance to 
. Industries I-Iall, came to be thought 
of as being practically inaccessible.
But with the advent of the cur­
rent national emergency and its re­
sultant scarcity of trained indus­
trial workers, the shop courses have 
assumed again the prominent posi­
tion that they once held. For these 
very shops that have been increas­
ingly “de-emphasized” in the regu­
lar curriculum are becoming the 
scene of some of Carnegie Tech’s 
greatest contributions to the de- 
Cense of our country.
In the machine shop, a course of 
instruction is being carried on by 
Carnegie Tech, in conjunction with 
the Canonsburg Iron and Steel 
Company. Thirty-four young men 
from Canonsburg come to Pitts­
burgh in a bus every morning for 
seven and one half hours of in­
struction. The Canonsburg Iron 
and Steel Company enters into the 
arrangement by agreeing to employ 
all those trainees who show suf­
ficient aptitude.
From the time that these men 
pile enthusiastically out of their 
bus at eight-thirty until they scrub 
their grimey and oil-soaked hands 
at 4:45, they are busily engaged in 
learning to make the tools and other 
implements which are so essential 
to the defense of this nation.

President Doherty 
To Give Address 
To Student Body
Next Tuesday Carnegie Tech will 
hold its twenty-ninth annual ob­
servance of Founders Day. Each 
year, just before the Thanksgiving 
recess, the school holds an assembly 
at the Carnegie Music Hall in com­
memoration of the birthday of An­
drew Carnegie. This year marks 
the one hundred and seventh an­
niversary of the birth of “Andy.” 
Highlighting the event will be an 
address to the student body and at­
tending alumni by President Rob­
ert S. Doherty.
At 10:30 all classes will recess to 
enable the students to attend the as­
sembly. At this time the band and 
R. O. T. C. contingent will form and 
march in a body to the Carnegie 
Music Hall. If the weather is in­
clement, the students will assemble 
At the Music Hall without parading. 
The program is scheduled, to start at 
11:00 sharp. Classes will resume at 
1:30.
Scholarship Cups Awarded 
The program proper will begin 
with a musical prelude rendered by 
a student organist. Immediately 
following will be the invocation, 
given by the Right Reverend Alex­
ander Mann, Bishop of the Diocese 
the main address. The subject ol! 
his talk Is “Forfeited Values.” This 
will be the third speech given by 
the President during the past two 
weeks; the first two were delivered 
in Chicago, and at Penn Slate. The 
message from the alumni will be 
given to the assembly by Mr. 
James Howard Kindelberger. After 
the talks, the four honoraries havn 
ing the highest average factors will 
be honored by being permitted to 
give their calls. Departing from the 
usual custom, the calls will be an­
nounced in the Carnegie Day pro­
gram. At this time the cups for 
outstanding scholastic achievement 
will also be awarded. These Cups 
are given to the fraternity and sor- 
orily which compiled the highest 
. average factor during the past 
school year, and also to the dormf-*. 
lories which achieved that distinc-. 
tion. Because in the past no rec-. 
ognition has been given to the stu­
dents who scholastically rank in the. 
upper ten per cent of the class, but 
do not hold scholarships, it has been 
decided to list their names in the 
program along with the various, 
scholarship holders.
In addition to the organ prelude' 
and postlude, the musical program 
will consist of two arrangements 
played by the orchestra of the music 
department under the direction of 
J. Vick O’Brien; and the Alma 
Mater.
Talk On Flowers 
Supplants Chapel
Today, at 11:30, in Room 104, In­
dustries, Dr. Paul R. Stewart of 
Waynesburg University will present 
a talk entitled “Wild Flowers of 
the Appalachians.” This assembly 
is to supplant the usual chapel.
The program is being sponsored 
by the Tech student unit of the 
Secours Franco American society. 
This group was first formed to send 
aid to the beleaguered people of 
France but since the fall of this 
fcountry, the society has become the 
British American War Relief Aso- 
ciation. This organization collects 
aid in various forms throughout the 
United States and sends it to the 
needy in Britain. In line with this 
program the Tech group is holding 
today’s assembly and is charging 
25c admission, tax included, the 
proceeds to go to the war relief 
fund.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1941
Issue Editors Take Charge
Beginning with the issue of December 9 the TARTAN will be 
published, by the junior editors of the staff. The first five issues will 
find the juniors in charge of the issue, but they will be subject to the 
advice and aid of the members of the senior staff. During this “trial 
period/' we hope that they will absorb sufficient information to 
enable them to put out a paper with the minimum amount of help 
from the senior staff.
We realize that this is a drastic step, but we feel that this is 
perhaps the best'way in which a junior editor can gain the experi­
ence that is needed to become a member of the next senior staff. 
Mistakes will occur; however, we feel that the experience of shoul­
dering complete responsibility of editing an issue will make for a 
better paper in the future.
Henceforth when the name Issue Editor appears in the paper, 
it will ‘mean that the two juniors whose names are published be­
neath the editorial column will be in complete administrative charge 
of the paper from the assigning of stories through the copy editing, 
makeup, and finally the finished, paper on Tuesday.
We would like very much to hear comments and suggestions 
from our readers on constructive methods of improving either the 
appearance or the quality of the paper. If comments are forthcom­
ing, we will act on them and strive to incorporate the best features 
in the coming issues which the juniors will publish.
Letter to the Editor
I am not a member of the Home 
Economics or Household Economics 
Department and for this reason I 
feel that I can make some sugges­
tions since there can be no reper­
cussions upon myself. Although not 
under the jurisdiction of these de­
partments, I have in the past few 
years heard a series of unending 
complaints from my friends in the 
department and I have come to the 
conclusion that there must be some 
reason for this, and that something 
should be done to remedy the situa­
tion.
Recently, a two hour class in 
Demonstration Cookery was length­
ened to include four hours and part 
of this class overruns the time set 
aside for chapel. This is against 
the rules set up by the Administra­
tion. Students in this class have 
also had to reschedule other classes 
to make way for Demonstration 
Cookery.
The staff of the department, 
taken as a whole, has been out­
moded in its methods of teaching. 
One textbook has been used, with­
out revision, for twenty-three years. 
In recent years theory has been 
stressed more and more, in spite 
of the fact that experience in cook­
ing makes the best teacher. The 
girls listen three hours to a lecture 
by one person and in this manner,
it is presumed, they will gain 
enough knowledge about cookery. 
The same principles are taught over 
and over again each year, the only 
difference being that the course is 
called by a different name. Reports 
are required each week that neces­
sitate hours of library work. The 
latter are not beneficial since the 
reports usually consist of direct 
copies of magazines or books, the 
person who copies the most ma­
terial receiving the highest grade. 
If a student quotes from a book 
written by a member of the fac­
ulty, he is automatically given 
special consideration, since favor­
itism and partisanship towards cer- . 
tain students is an accepted fact.
I could go on and mention the 
Nursery School where the students 
observe four 01* five children at play 
and work— in this way gaining the 
inexplicable something that makes 
them a good mother; the Practice 
House is dreaded by all the girls, 
though it should be the best liked 
of all projects.
Recent graduates in this depart­
ment have had trouble in obtaining 
good positions since the method of 
teaching and the material learned 
is far inferior to that of other col­
leges. It is- high time that some­
thing is done about this.

Cff The Cuff
She is the girl that everyone 
knows and would like to know more 
about, for she is Tech’s honorary 
cadet colonel. She is the Dudley 
G. Summer’s model who smiled at 
you from illustrations in several 
stories in The Saturday Evening 
Post and Good Housekeeping. She 
is vice-president of the Kappas and 
president of C. W. C. A. She is 
Peggy Stuchell.
If she were to be described in a 
word, she would be called “lady­
like.” Her pet peeves are an in­
dication of that. She hates peo­
ple who rudely bump into you on 
the street and who impolitely get 
out of elevators before women.
Among her hobbies she lists 
swimming, reading, and designing 
her own clothes. The unusual blue 
dress that she wore at the Military 
Ball was one that she had designed 
and made herself. Although her 
interests are varied, clothes seem 
to be her special love. During 
the summer she modeled at Horne’s.
Peggy thinks that campus life at 
Tech is wonderful. The men, she 
says, are very nice, even if they are 
engineers and have to study hard! 
However, we could have more co­
operation among the various clubs 
on campus.
She has high hopes for the future 
of C. W. C. A. Discussion groups 
have been formed to give people a
•«iik.'Ä ss05FC—h
chance to talk about the topics that 
interest them. These groups will be 
smaller than they have been up 
to this time and will deal with any­
thing which the students desire 
to discuss. For this reason, - she 
wants to see a bigger attendance 
at C. W. C. A. meetings.
When asked what her ambition 
was she said it was to teach home 
economics. She has prepared her­
self well to fit into that, or almost 
any other field.

The meeting was called to order at 7:15 p. m.
Absent: Miss HogR.
COMMITTEE REPORTSTreasury
Mr. Hill reported that he had been noti­
fied that there will be a shortage of gold 
anti silver which will prevent our getting 
activities keys unless they are ordered 
soon. He moved that Council give him 
permission to order approximately enough .. 
keys for this year, based on the number 
needed last year, and they will be en­
graved later.
Motion carried.
Budget
Mr. McBride presented the C. W. C. A. 
budget and moved for its approval.
Motion carried.
Cheeking
Mr. Richardson asked Mr. . Zeigler to 
handle the checking of the Women’s Guild 
Dance, buT any money that is left after 
paying the attendants is to be turned over 
to the Guild instead of to Student Coun­
cil. Mr. Hill moved tTiat the checking re­
ceipts be given to the Guild.
Motion carried.
Publications
Mr. Durbin announced that there will be 
n meeting of the Publications Committee 
on Thursday evening, at 7 o’clock, in the 
Conference Room. The purpose of the 
meeting is to decide how to rearrange the

Union.
Spring Carnival

three-day Carnival because the Executive 
Board had denied the petition for the extra 
dny.
Orientation
Mr. Wines reported that the last Tradi­
tions re-oxnm hnd been »riven rind that 77 
Freshmen hnd either failed the exam or

names will be sent to the heads of campus 
activities.
OLD BUSINESS 
Mr. Reynolds moved that Student Coun­
cil pass the proposed amendment to the 
Intramural Board Constitution. In the fol­
lowing discussion Mr. Burton snld that he 
felt that the boys who have had varsity 
training have too great an advantage over 
the other boys who did not have this op­
portunity. Mr. Wines said that he felt 
that the boys who play for the varsity 
should not be denied the privilege of pl.ay- 
InR In intramural sports because they hove 
paid their activity fee and should be en­
titled to play. Mr. Ileer snld that both the 
Intramural Board and the Intramural Man­
agers' Club have passed this motion, nnd 
as they are the people who should really 
know what the Intramural situation Is, 
Council should do as they have recom­
mended.
Motion carried.
NEW BUSINESS 
Mr. Richardson asked Council If they 
wanted to send Christmas cards to the 
faculty this year, as has been done In the 
past. Mr. Hill moved that Council ap­
propriate the money to purchase Christmas cards.
Motion carried.

Fifth, we want all policies and op­

To assure coast-to-coast telephone facilities adequate 
to meet future defense needs, the Bell System is con­
structing a 1600 mile, $20,000,000 cable line between 
Omaha and Sacramento.
Several newly developed*fplow trains,” working from 
opposite ends of tlie line, are burying the cable for 
maximum protection. They dig deep furrows, lay two 
cables in them and cover them with earth—all in one 
continuous operation. Their meeting will mark com­
pletion of the first l00 NlY0C line across the continent. 
Carrier systems will be operated in the cables — one 
direction of transmission in each.
This vast project is just one of thousands in which 
the Bell System is now engaged to provide additional

Independent Squad
The game between the Fraternity 
All-Stars and the Independent All- 
Stars was witnessed by a small 
•crowd last Thursday. The idea be­
hind this -games was that the pro­
ceeds (10 cents per person) were to 
go toward the “I Want A Team” 
fund. But owing to a split in man­
agement, the advertising was inef­
fective. This was a very worthy 
cause and those who plan such a 
game next year can gain much by 
this year’s game. It has been sug­
gested that the entire management 
come under the Intramural Man­
agers club.
The first part of the game went 
rather slowly possibly because 
neither team had played together 
enough to knoW just what plays to 
call. But as .time went-on things, 
got fairly hot. The Independents 
clicked for shot passes and short 
gains but they were not great 
enough to put them into the pay 
¦dirt. Many times these boys found 
themselves back on their heels 
and could not find the stuff to bring 
them from the shadow of their own 
goal.
The frat boys were very slow,in 
starting to click. But they were on 
their toes and kept plugging along 
all the time. The Brinn-Chottiner 
combination brought forth long 
gains on passes . that looked like
Intra-Squad Rifle 
Match Is Held
This Friday evening, an intra- 
:squad rifle match will be held on 
the range in the basement of Mar­
garet Morrison at 7:00 P. M. The 
senior and sophomore members of 
the varsity Tech rifle squad, who 
will be managed by A1 Parthum, 
will compete against the junior 
riflemen, who will be under the 
management of Charles Snyder.
This match is the first of its kind 
•ever held at Tech and is being stag­
ed for the practice and experience 
that the squad will derive from act­
ual competition. All of. the men 
will shoot four shots from each of 
the four standard positions. The 
-complete roster of both teams will 
compete and the five highest scores 
of each team will be used to deter­
mine the winner of the meet. Ac- 
cox-ding to Sergeant Sommers, the 
high scorer will be awarded a Na­
tion Rifle Association Club medal.

flukes but nevertheless Dave Brinn 
came in under the long heaves nice­
ly. Rosenfleld was very effective 
in the line. Lee, DeMuesy and 
Rhoades were also very strong cogs 
in the machine. These boys were a 
little too much for the Bundy-Bash- 
Heights-McDonald-Miller-Van Or­
man group, who worked very hard 
and had the game all their way for 
a time but just did not have the 
extra urge to show a win.
The scoring was made up of safe­
ties, first downs and touchdowns. 
The frat men had one touchdown, 
two safeties and three first downs 
on their side of the ledger to give 
them 12 points. The Indies scored 
three first downs for their total of 
three points.
From all indications the best 
brand of-ball should be credited to 
the fraternities. Several reasons 
would justify this statement. First 
in the play-offs both of the fraterni­
ties who were representing their 
leagues bumped off the boys from 
McGill. Then the Fraternity All- 
Stars took the Independent All- 
Stars into camp. As mentioned be­
fore, this department thinks that 
the fraternities played a little bet­
ter football this year.
Frosli Tie Sophs 
6-6 In Grid Fray
The annual grudge battle be­
tween the • Sophomores and the 
Freshmen took place Friday of last 
week. As you probably know this 
blood and thunder fray is a classic, 
not so much in good football but 
rather just plain old fight. Neither 
team showed much class but some 
of the play was definitely worth 
watching.
The sophs made plenty of yards 
through the line but when they 
_ would near the double stripe they 
” would bog down. The freshmen 
gained mostly around the ends.
The winning play (moral victory, 
of course) started out as a reverse 
for the. sophs and ended up as a 
touchdown for the frosh. Philip- 
chuck took the ball from center, 
started through his own right tackle, 
gave the ball to Sutch who lateraled 
to Byers. But, Byers went into the 
air to take the high toss from Sutch, 
Lindsay snatched the pill from 
Byer’s hands and raced 97 yards for 
the score. This play would have 
been a score for the sophs had it 
gone correctly in the backfield be­
cause all the blockers had their 
men out of the way and the coast 
was clear. They were on the three- 
yard line and had two downs to 
pick up those three yards.
This game was a definite moral 
victory for the frosh. There were 
very few people who thought that 
the frosh had a ghost of a chance. 
The only thing that defeated the 
sophs’ purpose was the fact that 
internal dissention rent their ranks. 
Had they had the fight displayed by 
the freshmen and played as a team, 
they should have won. But after 
the freshmen scored they seemed to 
develop a fighting attitude and 
stopped the sophs’ attack.

F reslimen 1-0 V To Il.O1CoR
Playing for the last time this sea­
son, the Varsity Soccer team clash­
ed with the Freshman squad last 
Thursday. The result of the en­
counter was -a 1-0 victory for the 
Varsity; the tally being scored in 
the first half by George Tondorf. 
Playing for the most part a defen­
sive game, the freshman put up a 
good battle, as the score indicates. 
The Varsity, composed largely of 
seniors, held the advantage 
throughout the game, however, 
due mainly to the efforts of Stan 
Malinski, Captain Sam Rickley, 
Bob Reisacher, Will Dean, Nelson 
Crooks, George Tondorf, and Pinky 
Lees. Nick Yaru, of the freshman 
squad, played an exceptionally good 
game.
The plebes,r- scheduled to meet^Y. 
M. C. A. Soccer team last Satur­
day, were unable to play since the 
opponents failed to turn up for the 
game. Tomorrow, however, the 
freshmen will play their last game 
of the season, a return engagement 
with the Western Pennsylvania 
School for the Deaf. The first game 
with W. P. I. D. ended with a 1 
to 1 tie, so the game this Wednes­
day should be an interesting one.
Reviewing the Soccer season as a 
whole, this year was the poorest 
that the Varsity has ever had. Their 
record of no wins seems to indicate 
an inferior team, but the low score 
of every encounter indicates that 
the team just didn’t quite have that 
extra punch that was needed. With 
an exceptionally strong freshman 
squad this year, the Varsity should 
look forward to a more successful 
season next year.
Carnegie Tech’s gridders are en­
joying a two-week vacation before 
they meet the rejuvenated Pan­
thers on November 29. The Pan­
thers have stiffened their lines of 
defense and have moved into the 
offensive during the last two weeks, 
which again makes the Tartans a 
definite underdog on their record 
this season.
The Panthers first showed their 
might against the Scarlet Scourge 
of Ohio State three weeks ago, 
when they held the Bucks to a 
small margin. This was followed 
the next week by one of the big­
gest upsets in the country when 
Pitt beat the highly rated Fordham. 
Pittsburgh fans had scarcely time 
to catch their breath when the 
Panther team put Nebraska on the 
short end of a 14-7 score last week. 
Next' Saturday Penn' State will try: 
its luck against the newly awakened 
giant in Pitt Stadium, and everyone 
agrees that it will be a close battle. 
After that game comes the payoff 
for the Skibos, when they meet the 
boys from across the way.
Jones and Fife are the two hinges 
upon which the whole Pitt team is 
turning at the present. Jones inter­
cepted a pass in the Fordham game 
and ran thirty-five yards for a 
touchdown with Dutton opening the 
path. That play was not exactly a 
debut for Jones since he has been 
playing good ball all season. Fife 
has done much to start and keep 
moving the midseason rally of the 
Panthers.- He is considered one of 
the best backers-up of the line in 
this section of the country, and well 
does he deserve this rating after 
performing the fine work that he 
has done.

Last Sunday the Tech Varsity 
played a pre-season game with the 
Wcstinghouse Apprentices. For such 
an early game the Tech Cagers 
looked to be shaping into a promis­
ing team. The first string positions 
are not yet filled and there is a light 
to get a place on the first team. 
Although no first team has been 
chosen the following boys are show­
ing up in their respective positions: 
Kaplan at center, Brinn and Show­
man at forwards, DeBortoli and 
Hennesy at guards. Kirk, Stosuy, 
and Alexander are making serious 
bids for position on the first team. 
After football season is over some 
promising candidates should turn 
out. As. yet the veteran center, 
Hank Hblets,-has not turned out for 
the team. Against the Westing- 
house boys the Tech team showed 
up quite well in scoring, but the 
opponents penetrated the Tech de­
fense many times to score. The 
final score however, was forty-five 
to thirty-three in favor of Tech.'
The freshman team has been 
practicing about three weeks and 
has been developing into a fine 
looking group of freshman players. 
According to the freshman coach, 
Buzz Greenberg, this year’s fresh­
men look, better'than did the fresh­
man team at the same time last
year. The competion for berths on 
the team has been very keen. The 
team has been lining up in the fol­
lowing order: Mauer ot center,
Mark ond Smith at guards, and 
Lindel and Moss ot forwards. This 
lineup is only temporary for Snow, 
Nelson, Miller, Parker, and Childs 
are also fighting for these positions. 
The freshman play their first game 
against the same team that the var­
sity scrimmaged lust Sunday, the 
Wcstinghouse Apprentices. The 
freshman schedule- is by no means 
an easy one. They meet Central 
Catholic, the Geneva College Re­
serve, the Washington and Jefferson 
Freshmen, the West Virginia Fresh­
men and the Penn State Freshmen 
during the season.
Assisting Max Hannum, the var­
sity coach, is Gordy Combs, a Tech 
graduate who played basketball on 
the Tech team in nineteen thirty- 
eight and thirty-nine. It was dur­
ing this time that Carnegie Tech 
had some of its outstanding teams. 
Coaching the freshmen is Buzz 
Greenburg, another Carnegie Tech 
alumnus, who played basketball in 
thirty-eight. From the appearance 
of the team thus far, the boys 
should be able to make a better rec­
ord than did the team last year. 
The freshmen should also be able 
to complete a successful season.

Thanksgiving Dance 
Greensburg Techniters 
Insignia Points
Evening Student Council’s Annual 
ThanksgiyingSemi-formalNov.22
Distinctive Music 
To Be Furnished 
By Lee Barrett
The usual confusion which has 
accompanied, for the past several 
years, the setting of the official 
date for the observance of Thanks­
giving Day has affected the plans 
for the annual Thanksgiving 
Dance. It is traditional that the 
dance be held during the Thanks­
giving Recess, and since Governor 
James has declared that Pennsyl­
vania shall observe Thanksgiving 
on the last Thursday in November 
it would follow that the dance 
should be held on the Friday even­
ing following. However, due to 
the unusually heavy social schedule 
during this week it has been de­
cided by the Council that the dance 
be held on the Saturday before 
Thanksgiving Day, the twenty-sec­
ond.
The dance will be, as is the cus­
tom, a semi-formal affair, and it 
goes without saying that all the 
girls will welcome the chance to 
“dress up” and we are sure that the 
boys will like the idea of tne devia­
tion from the usual informal at­
tire. Beautiful corsages will be 
presented to the girls, and pro­
grams in keeping with the holiday 
spirit will also be distributed. 
There will be only two hundred of 
these corsages and programs, so 
make it a point to come early in 
order that you may be one of the 
lucky couples to receive them. This 
is one of the few dances for which 
an assessment is charged. This 
year the price of the tickets is $1.00 
a couple (plus tax) but we are sure
. . . Lee blooCEE 
that it will pay a much higher div­
idend in pleasure and enjoyment.
As was announced in last week’s 
issue of the “Plaid,” Lee Barrett 
and his orchestra will supply the 
music. His band is well known in 
this part of the country, having 
played in many of the summer re­
sorts in and around Pittsburgh and 
also at many of the hotels and coun­
try clubs for private dances. It’s 
an old belief that “It’s the music 
that makes the dance.” We agree 
with this, but don’t forget it’s the 
attendance that proves whether 
the affair will be a succes or a fail­
ure. Council has done its part. It 
has supplied the music to make the 
dance. Now it’s up to each one of 
you to supply the attendance to 
make it a success.
Workers Needed 
For Decorating 
Gym On Nov. 22
The evening social functions at 
Carnegie Tech are without ques­
tion the finest affairs anyone could 
ask for. The entertainment they 
offer is well worth the small fee 
asked for an admission.
These affairs are made possible 
by the efforts of the students, stu­
dents who come out to lend a hand 
with all the little jobs to be taken 
care of during the workers’ periods 
before and after the dance, and to 
help out on the evening of the 
dance.
Workers are needed for Student 
Council’s Thanksgiving Dance to be 
held this coming Saturday. The 
decoration period is Saturday aft­
ernoon from one to five, and help 
will be needed to clean up the hall 
on Sunday — the time — also from 
one to five. Workers offer their as­
sistance on the evening of the dance 
to help check coats, pin corsages 
and do various other jobs.
For each period a student works, 
three points are awarded him to­
wards his Insignia Key. The key 
is r'eally worth working for, and 
something to be proud of.
Remember Saturday, November 
22nd. Set aside the date and put 
in your appearance. Your help will 
be appreciated by those in charge 
of the dance.

The Carnegie Techniters, promin­
ent organization in our Evening 
College composed of students from 
the Greensburg District, elected of­
ficers for 1941 and 1942 at their last 
regular meeting. Those elected 
were: President Samuel E. Webb,
Greensburg; Vice-President, Joseph 
H. Houston, Greensburg; Secretary, 
John H. Gibbons, Alverton; Treas­
urer, John L. Glancy, Greensburg; 
Transportation Committee, Joseph 
H. Houston, Greensburg; and Rich­
ard R. Shields Greensburg.
The Greensburg Carnegie Tech­
niters were organized several years 
ago, and this organization has suc- 
’ ceeded in bringing a fine group of 
young people together for many 
successful affairs.
The object of this group is to in­
duce the Carnegie night students 
within a radius of fifteen miles of 
Greensburg to make plans for 
dances, banquets, and also to ar-' 
range transportation to and from 
school for these students. If you 
live within a fifteen-mile radius of 
Greensburg and have not yet ar­
ranged for transportation, get in 
touch with the Greensburg Carnegie 
Techniters’ Transportation Commit­
tee, and we assure you plans will be 
made for you to ride to and from 
school.

Robert B. Leighou 
Scholarship Fund 
Will Be Enlarged
On Friday evening, November 28, 
Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity will 
hold its Fall Robert B. Leighou Me­
morial Scholarship Dance. This 
dance was scheduled for an earlier 
date but was postponed due to a 
congested social calendar. It is an­
nounced, now, that the dance will be 
held during the Thanksgiving recess 
and dancing will be in session from 
9:00 to 1:00 in Thistle Hall.
This affair is a regular bi-annual 
event of the fraternity sponsoring 
the scholarship fund which is one 
of the major projects of this organ­
ization.
For an orchestra the committee 
planning the dance has selected 
Herbert Fritchie and his “Music 
With a Smile.” The unique style 
and arrangements will surely satisfy 
all who attend. Mr. Fritchie’s or­
ganization has appeared on the 
campus many times and has always 
supplied very pleasing and enter­
taining music.
The assessment for the dance will 
be the usual price of one dollar, 
per couple. Tickets can be obtain­
ed from any member of Nu Sigmar' 
Alpha fraternity or may be pur­
chased at the door.
This Thanksgiving - Scholarship 
Dance offers a splendid opportun­
ity for all the students on the Car­
negie Tech campus and the fra­
ternity extends an invitation to all 
to attend this affair and spend a 
very enjoyable evening.
Evening Council Aspirants 
Restricted By Outmoded Rules
In the discussions which have de­
veloped relative to the various 
council ofilccs, as well as member­
ship on council, it has been shown 
that rules and regulations have 
been set up which control the hold­
ing thereof by the students. These 
have become known as eligibility 
rules and are referred to frequently 
by council in deciding questions as 
to whether or not a student may 
hold office.
When the council was set up and 
a constitution decided upon and 
adopted back in 1024-25, the fram­
ers of this constitution were thor­
oughly familiar with the rigors and 
hardships which confronted stu­
dents attending evening classes at 
Carnegie and they tempered their 
by-laws accordingly. They know 
what it meant to trudge to the cam­
pus, for all of them put in not one 
or two years but several years. 
Their decision to keep rules and 
regulations to a minimum were jus­
tified. Often conditions would arise 
which made it impossible to con­
tinue classes regularly, still they 
were able to render efficient service 
to the student body and do credit to 
themselves. As the name of Carnegie 
still stands out in the district, at­
tendance at evening classes is a 
badge of distinction.
For a numer of years the council 
operated on a very simple set of 
rules—eligibility rules which re­
quired that a student be registered 
two years in the evening colleges, 
one of which to be in the college 
where the student held office, and 
also that the student had earned an 
insignia award. These rules seem­
ed adequate enough until six or 
seven years ago when a rush was 
made to build up additional rules 
and regulations which have made it 
very difficult for council to secure 
students who fulfill these require­
ments.
The number of hours of attend­
ance as well as grades, etc., have 
been used to predicate a student’s 
eligibility. Some of these factors 
are working hardships on the even­
ing students. When these new rules 
were first put into force there had 
not been an appreciable increase in 
the tuition rate, but of late years, 
and particularly the last three 
years, the rates have been increased 
so as to limit the number of hours 
students can afford to pay for.
The rate of tuition is made on a 
credit basis whereas the number of 
hours is still the unit for measure 
on the council. The Institute meas­
ures by credits, the council by 
hours. A student may pay for nine 
credits, four and one-half each se­
mester, and the attendance would 
be only one and one-half hours as 
against two hours in the former set­
up. From this it may be noted that
C. S. EDMÄN
PRINTER

the hourly basis of attendance is not 
wholely justified. The rate of tui­
tion has been mentioned as a factor 
in cutting down the number of 
hours a student may register for, 
but this is not the only one since 
there is considerable expense incur­
red by students riding to and from 
the campus together with cost of 
extra lunches, etc. This additional 
cost is very marked when one con­
siders that three hours or at the 
most four hours is all a student can 
possibly attend in the evening, and 
these extended hours are possibly 
only In a few cases. One and one- 
half, or what formerly was a two- 
hour period for an evening was the 
usual run of hours, multiply this 
by five evenings and you can ar­
rive at the cost of transportation 
which is involved. When it is com­
pared with the attendance at day 
classes the same number of hours 
could be covered by two days’ at­
tendance, and the transportation 
cost would be materially reduced.
It becomes, therefore, a very se­
rious problem from a monetary 
standpoint as far as the evening 
student is concerned and his ability 
to register for the number of hours 
is tempered by the cost of transpor­
tation in addition to the cost of tui­
tion. The number of hours neces­
sary to spend in going to and from 
the campus entails considerable 
outlay, although not usually looked 
upon from a monetaiy standpoint, 
still this should be taken into con­
sideration.
If one is to be broad-minded, it 
will have to be admitted that any 
handicap thrown in the way of an 
evening student is a double hard­
ship and this does not work for the 
best interest of all concerned. A re­
view of the eligibility rules should 
be made promptly so as to make ad­
justments and remove any handi­
caps which exist and which prevent 
full cooperation of students with 
council.
