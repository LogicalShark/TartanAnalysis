BETA THETA EPSILON TAKES 
FIRST PLACE IN THE 
LEAGUE.
All of the seven fraternity teams 
were seen in action last week. Beta 
Theta Epsilon took first place in the 
league standing by winning its single 
game, and maintained the only clean 
slate in the percentage column. Theta 
Xi, Woodlawn Club, and the Zeta 
Lambda Epsilon broke even, thus 
causing a three cornered tie for the 
runner-up position. Theta Xi and 
Woodlawn Club engaged in a thriller 
on Tuesday, when an extra three min­
ute period was required to give the 
former a 12 to 11 victory. Xi Sigma 
Upsilon atoned for its first defeat, but 
Sigma Tau and Sigma Rho were not 
so fortunate.
The remaining games of the first 
division teams will be played the first 
week after the Christmas vacation as 
follows:
Tuesday, January 6th.
Sigma Rho vs. Theta Xi.
Woodlawn Club vs. Beta Theta Ep­
silon.

Prof. F. P. Day, of the Margaret 
Morrison School, spoke to the Science 
students Wednesday morning, Decem­
ber 10th, on the customs and habits 
of the students of England and Ger­
many. His address was highly inter­
esting and filled with humorous anec­
dotes. Extracts from his speech are 
given below:
“I thought that perhaps I might in­
terest you by something of the life of 
other students. I lived three years at 
Oxford and one year at the University 
of Berlin. The one thing that be­
wilders the American student abroad 
is the sudden change in the university 
attitude in regard to work. In Eng­
land and Germany there are no month­
ly tests. After two years of prepara­
tion the examination comes and lasts 
for two weeks. About a month after 
the written examination the oral ex­
amination takes place. This lasts any­
where from IS minutes to two hours, 
and is very terrifying but effective in 
finding out what a man knows. The 
student is escorted into a large room 
in which the officials of the school are 
sitting around a large table and the 
interested town people or relatives of 
other victims stand around the wall. 
He is then seated on a low stool and 
the examination begins. As the ex­
aminers have studied the student’s ex­
amination papers and found his weak 
spots, it doesn’t take very long to learn 
the depth of his knowledge.
“The very great advantage of this 
is that a man who passes the whole 
two years’ work at once must know
his subject thoroughly. The disad­
vantage is that it ruins many because 
a great many need to be prodded 
along. However, the man who has 
freedom and strength of mind enough 
to apply himself strengthens his will 
power and character.
“Our system is best to serve one 
purpose and is the most efficient.
“They have another peculiar system 
at Oxford and that is the tutorial sys­
tem. Each first year man has one of 
the younger professors or instructors 
assigned as his adviser to whom he 
goes once a month to talk over the 
work. At Oxford the professors and 
supervisors don’t take a great deal of 
interest in the school work but they 
take more in your personal welfare. 
It happened that I was assigned to a 
very lazy professor who did very little 
for my knowledge, but who took a 
lot of interest in American football.
I would get him talking football for 
an hour and some of the formations 
that I described, I am sure would 
have produced startling results if they 
had ever been tried.
“At 9 o’clock every evening the bell 
in Town Tower, Christ Church Col­
lege, rings 101 times and the gate is 
closed. Any coming in after that have 
to be admitted by the porter and are 
reported. At 12:15 the gates are locked 
for the night.
“The system of punishment for in­
fractions of the rules is nearly entirely 
all by fines . If a student is caught out 
late, no excuses are asked for or ac­
cepted, but he is fined about two

KEEPS CLOSELY POSTED ON 
PITTSBURGH—TALKS OF 
SCHOOLS.
Andrew Carnegie spent last Thurs­
day and Friday in Washington. During 
his 24-hour visit he attended a meeting 
of the Carnegie Foundation, called 
at the White House with Mrs. Car­
negie to pay his respects to the Presi­
dent, boomed Senator Elihu Root of 
New York for the presidency in 1916, 
set a standard of simplicity for Jeffer­
sonian Democracy by walking to the 
White House from his hotel while 
secretaries, senators and many plain 
people rode in carriages and taxicabs, 
talked of his Pittsburgh benefactions, 
especially the Carnegie School of 
Technology and his hopes for the fu­
ture of the institution; praised the in­
coming city administration, let his 
mind wander from Dumfernline, Scot­
land, the town of his birth, to Greens- 
burg, Pa., where he learned teleg­
raphy, asked questions faster than they 
could be answered and wound up a 
busy day for a man of 78 by attend­
ing a dinner tonight.
On the subject of Pittsburgh, Mr. 
Carnegie exhibited evident enjoyment 
and his memory for names familiar 
to the average Pittsburgher and his 
intimate knowledge of the city’s 
progress were in themselves a reve­
lation.
He could anticipate most any ques­
tion and declared that he kept in close 
touch with the scenes of his early 
triumphs through his old-time friends 
and by reading the newspapers. He 
said he proposed to go back “home”

TION TO HONORARY

“Editorial Note:
In order to avoid any doubt as to 
responsibility for editorials we wish 
to make the following statement. 
After the first two issues of this year 
all editorials, with the exception of two 
or possibly three, have been written 
by the Editor-in-Chief. Hereafter 
any contributed editorials will be 
signed by the writer; it will be under­
stood that all unsigned editorials are 
written by the Editor-in-Chief, and 
that he assumes all responsibility 
therefor.”
A STRONG ENDORSEMENT OF 
OUR POLICY.
We were much pleased to receive 
the following letter from the Sean- 
nachie Society:
December 12, 1913. 
“To the Editor of The Tartan:
“It was with astonishment that we 
learned today that exception was taken 
to your article in this week’s Tartan, 
headed ‘A Query,’ and that you were 
told not to adopt such a policy in your 
editorial columns again. We do not 
object to the fact that you were criti­
cized, but we do resent any such ob­
jections to the fulfillment of your du­
ties toward the student body.
“Considering that no financial re­
port has been published by the Student 
Activities Committee during the past
two years, your editorial calling for 
such a report was most timely. The 
request for such a report in your edi­
torial was polite and unoffending, and 
we fail to see how any objection could 
have been made to it, voicing as it 
did the inquiry of a large number of 
the students who have a right to know 
how their money is spent. We can 
only wonder that The Tartan has not 
made such a demand before.
“Therefore, by unanimous vote, we 
hereby unqualifiedly endorse your pol­
icy in this case, and we congratulate 
you upon adopting it. We would 
recommend that you continue such 
a progressive policy in the future.” 
(Signed) Seannachie Society.
P. S. “We would suggest that this 
letter be printed in the next issue of 
The Tartan.”
In explanation of the above, it might 
be well briefly to outline the policy of 
The Tartan under the present Board 
of Editors. As stated early in the 
year to the Science students at a Mass 
Meeting, our object is to report ac­
curately and publish faithfully all news 
of interest to the student body. We 
shall endeavor at all times to serve 
the best interests of the school and the 
students, and the personal opinions 
of no one man, whoever he may be, 
will be able to dominate or' even in­
fluence our policy. Fraternity influ­
ence will count for nothing.
We do not object to criticism; on 
the contrary we welcome it. Frank, 
sincere criticism can only be helpful. 
But we cannot allow ourselves to be 
intimidated by any warning whatso­
ever, when we are endeavoring to 
serve the students.
We are not attempting to publish a 
“yellow” sheet, nor to adopt a destruc­
tive policy toward school spirit. We 
wish to help all student activities; but 
we believe the best method of helping 
them is to express frankly any just 
criticism which the students may 
have. When we make mistakes, as all 
of us do, we shall be only too glad 
to rectify them.
The financial report of the Student 
Activities Committee will appear in 
the next issue.
THE MISSION OF A COLLEGE 
PAPER.
The following editorial appeared in 
a recent issue of the “Daily Texan”, 
the official paper of the University of 
Texas. We reprint it, because we 
agree heartily with the statements 
made, and because we think it is most 
opportune. As an exponent of the 
views other college students are ex­
pressing, it should be of interest to 
our students:
“We have received so many com­
munications of late as to what should 
be our attitude toward the faculty and 
administrative officers of the Univer­
sity that we feel justified in stating 
our conception of the mission of a col­
lege paper.
“A paper that reaches 2,000 students 
can have a powerful influence for good 
or for bad. It is very effective as a 
moulder of student opinion. If it is 
properly edited, it can be of untold
benefit to the University and to the 
students themselves. If it is a me­
dium of “yellow journalism,” it can 
play havoc with University affairs in 
general.
“The problem that confronts us, 
then, is to so conduct the policy of 
the paper as to do the most good for 
the students and for the University.
“This is the students’ paper. We 
realize, however, that while we are 
free from faculty supervision, yet this 
does not justify us in defying the au­
thorities. We should work in perfect 
harmony with the faculty and the au­
thorities. If we failed to respect the 
authority of others, we would bring 
about a serious breach between the 
authorities and the students. This 
we would be very loath to do. Our 
ideal for a college paper is to have the 
students and faculty working in per­
fect harmony. This, we are happy to 
say, is true at the University of Texas. 
There have been some minor differ­
ences, and some one or two with 
whom we have not been able to agree, 
yet, on the whole, there is perfect 
harmony.
“Nevertheless, there are times when 
we are forced to print news stories 
that reflect somewhat on some parts 
of the University. We could very 
easily squelch everything that reflect­
ed discredit on the University. In this 
way we would step on nobody’s toes, 
would keep everybody in a good hu­
mor, and all would be pleased. But 
this would be cowardly, and would be 
unjust to the students and to the Uni­
versity itself. We are giving four 
years of our life to college training 
that we may learn how to live. The 
majority of the students are men and 
women. They are capable of solving 
the problems that confront them, and 
their growth is measured by their 
ability to cope with the situations as 
they arise.
“Legitimate publicity is the cure for 
all evils. It would be absurd for us 
to assert that everything that is done 
in University circles is right. This 
would be the inference if we failed to 
report the unpleasant things that we 
are often called upon to squelch. We 
believe that we should give publicity 
to our faults, if by so doing they can 
be cured.
“In some instances some things hap­
pen that the University authorities are 
very anxious to keep from the public. 
To publish them would cause unfavor­
able comment. We believe that, in 
the majority of cases, it would be bet­
ter to make them public. Here is 
where the only chance for conflict 
arises. We submit, however, that the 
taxpayers of the state who are sup­
porting the institution deserve to 
know just how it is being managed, 
and certainly the fathers and mothers 
deserve to know how their sons and 
daughters are living. If the authori­
ties make mistakes, the taxpayers 
should be advised; and if the students 
indulge in disreputable practices, their 
parents should not be kept in the dark.
“We complain that we are not amply 
provided for by the Legislature. Yes, 
and the only reason for this is that

the people of this state do not know 
and appreciate our needs. If they are 
consistently and fairly educated up to 
the point where they can see and real­
ize our condition, they will rise to the 
occasion and take care of the Univer­
sity. But we can not hope to accom­
plish this by keeping them' in the dark. 
If you report only the good things, 
there are others who will scatter 
broadcast the bad things, and so long 
as the taxpayers are led to believe 
that we are not playing fair with them 
—that we are suppressing something 
—just so long will they overestimate 
the suspicious reports that are sent 
out from other sources.
“We are ready to do anything for 
the good of the University and of 
higher education in general, but we 
have our own ideas as to how this 
should be done.”
ADVERTISING.
Do you consider the various pub­
lications in Carnegie as of any value 
to the institution or its students? Take 
the Football program for example. It 
is an essential part of a game and in 
addition furnishes some revenue to 
the Athletic Association. So in the 
case of the other programs. What 
would you think if The Thistle or The 
Tartan should disappear? Now this 
is not to say that this is probable but 
rather to show the part the advertisers 
play in making possible the various 
publications.
One of the principal duties of the 
business staff of any publication, par­
ticularly a college newspaper or pro­
gram, is to keep its advertising space 
filled with satisfied advertisers. The 
Tartan and the various programs are 
no exception to this rule and we feel 
that a few remarks concerning the 
attitude of an advertiser toward the 
students and the duties of the student 
to the advertiser are appropriate at this 
time.
There are three kinds of advertisers: 
first the merchant who takes space 
with the expectation of getting busi­
ness as a direct result; second the 
firm', which, because of business done 
with the students or the institution, 
is willing to reciprocate; and third, the 
individual or firm which is interested 
in the institution and contributes “To 
help the boys” as most of them put it.
The duties of the student to the ad­
vertiser must be looked at from a dif­
ferent viewpoint. The average stu­
dent does not have a proper apprecia­
tion of what the advertising he sees 
means to him or to his school. Let us 
consider then the possibility of every 
advertiser dropping out of a publica­
tion. The result would be an imme­
diate disappearance of such publica­
tion because the student body would 
not or could not be willing to pay the 
price that such a program or paper 
actually costs. The duties of the stu­
dent are therefore quite evident. He 
must not only patronize the advertis­
ers for everything he buys, but must 
go further and influence outsiders to 
do so, too.
There 'are a number of firms that 
have to compete with others for busi­
ness by bidding. Such, for example, 
are caterers and ball-rooms. Fre­
quently we receive complaints from 
this latter class to the effect that they 
have not been allowed the privilege 
of bidding on some Carnegie function, 
and that the business went to a firm 
not advertising and in some cases out 
of town.
The Tartan publishes every week, 
on the last page, a classified list of all 
advertisers arranged according to 
business. This list should be cut out 
and pinned conspicuously in every 
man’s room for constant reference. 
Further, when a dance, banquet, or 
smoker is being considered this classi­
fication should be referred to, and ad­
vertisers given the preference in all 
cases. How about a little of that Car­
negie ginger, one hears about, applied 
in the direction of the supporters of 
our publications?
G. GUY KELCEY.
BOOST.
Every real Tech man is a booster 
for the institution. He may not be 
conscious of it but he is nevertheless. 
His being here is, of itself, an acknowl­
edgment of the fact that he considers 
this the best place in which to get the 
training for his chosen work. The 
more optimistic men, the men who are 
doing things, the men with a vision 
and an ideal for the Alma Mater, are 
ever ready by word and action to pro­
claim her greatness. The pessimist 
may say nothing; he may even knock 
at times—but he comes back if the 
faculty is willing.
Now if everyone of us are really 
boosters for Carnegie, the work of the 
Students Booster Committee should 
receive the unanimous loyal support 
of the student body. Their work is 
simply to organize this spirit so that 
it will be most effective and will pro­
duce tangible results.
They are asking each student who 
goes home at vacation time to do a 
little active campaigning among the 
Seniors of their High School in the 
interests of Carnegie. To help him in 
this, they are furnishing him with 
small folders, descriptive of the work 
of the different schools, which he will 
hand to High School students. At the 
same time he will give the prospective 
Tech man a post-card which, when 
filled out and returned, will procure 
him any of the publications put out by 
the Institute.
If each Tech man who is going 
home for the holidays will take two or 
three or more sets of these folders and 
cards and see that they are judicious­
ly placed among the High School 
Seniors at home, he can feel that he 
has done a service for his Alma Mater 
and for the man at home» as well. 
The Plebes, especially, can do very 
good work in this way as they are 
still in close touch with the men in 
High School.
Let us get together, then, and 
prove by our works that we are 
not insensible to the interests of the 
institution which is giving us so much 
for so little. Let us put our enthusi-

THE DRAMATIC CLUB.
At last the evening for the Christ­
mas entertainment has arrived. Ev­
eryone is excited—hurrying to the 
store to get an orange or an apple to 
give with their ticket to old St. Nich­
olas—Costumes are finished; carols 
ring in the Christmas chime; young 
and old will be there to see the moth­
ers go by.
All the organizations of the School 
will take part in this Christmas festiv­
ity in the School gymnasium. The 
Dramatic Club presents, under the 
supervision of Mrs. Elizabeth Ver- 
mocken, a “Pageant of the Months” 
by Christina Rossetti. The Glee Club 
wrill sing several carols, full of Christ­
mas cheer. The Guild, ever ready to 
help the needy, will sell Scotch calen­
dars and candy in the hall for the 
henefit of the Tuberculosis League. 
They will also take charge of the fruit, 
giving it to some city settlement house 
to be distributed to worthy families.
THE CHORAL CLUB.
The Choral Club decided at their 
last meeting to postpone their enter­
tainment and party until after the 
Christmas holidays. The date to be 
settled after the vacation.
THE GUILD DANCE.
The Guild dance held in the gym­
nasium on Friday, December 12, was 
very successful socially and financial­
ly, due in a large measure to the ener­
getic work of the president, Miss 
Amelia Lehman, the chairman of the 
committees, Miss Leonora Honecker, 
Miss Eliza Dickey, Miss Katherine 
Dermitt, Miss- Elizabeth Caulfield, 
M iss Irene Pond, Miss Margaret 
Webb, Miss Mary McGrew and Miss 
Isabelle Haag.
The Guild Calendar, which has been 
compiled under the direction of Miss 
Ora Pendleton, made its first appear­
ance at the dance and was most ac­
ceptably received.

pounds. After three offenses, at an 
increasing fine each time, the student 
is expelled.
The students are supposed to wear 
cap and gowrn after nine o’clock, in 
order to distinguish them from the 
town people. Nobody wears them and 
a proctor accompanied by four fol­
lowers, chosen for their strength and 
fleetness of foot, go through the town 
and arrest everybody without cap and 
gown. Up to the time of the Rhodes 
scholars it was usual to submit tamely 
to arrest by the bulldogs or bullers 
as these servants are called, but the 
Rhodes scholars made it a custom to 
give the bullers a run for their money, 
and it is now looked upon as a regular 
game.
“Oxford University has absolute
control over the 40,000 people of the 
town. In the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries there were numerous riots 
between town and gown. The great­
est fight occurred when a student 
threw a beer mug into an inkeeper’s 
face because the beer was poor. In 
this riot there were several thousand 
on each side and thirty students were 
killed. After that the king gave the 
chancellor power over the town and 
all police arrests are now turned over 
to the college authorities.
“Customs have grown up through 
centuries. There is a book of rules at 
Oxford which contain some very 
ridiculous laws. One law forbids stu­
dents to shoot with crossbow on the 
streets of Oxford. The necessity for 
these laws has long since passed away 
but they are still retained on account 
of custom.
“There are lots of clubs at both 
Oxford and Cambridge but nothing 
corresponding to the American fra­
ternities.
“Of all students the Germans have 
the best time, although they drink a 
great deal too much. They are happy 
and free from care and spend a large 
part of their time strolling about sing­
ing and drinking. One reason for this 
is that all their lives they have had 
hard work without cessation in the 
gymnasium, and the resolve to have 
two years of enjoyment before settling 
down.
“They migrate from one university 
to another during these two years and 
then they settle down to three years 
of hard labor to get a degree.
“The German students have their 
corps which are similar to fraternities. 
The one great fault with these is that 
they drink to excess, most of them 
compelling their members to drink 
the first year. Duelling is very com­
mon and it is quite easy to gain ad­
mittance to a duel although it is sup­
posed to be kept quiet. This may 
seem queer but it must be remembered 
that the Germans are a military nation 
and have different views than ours. 
One of the results of these duels is 
the great politeness it inspires for fear 
a duel will result otherwise.
“The English view of athletics is 
quite different from ours in that the}' 
don’t seem to care who wins and never 
train especially for a contest. At Ox­
ford there are twenty-two colleges 
each of which has a field and from' two 
to four o’clock in the afternoon every­
one is playing or else on the river. 
There are very few spectators, for 
they don’t believe in sacrificing the 
whole student body to benefit and 
train a few athletes.
“I want to say in closing that the 
spirit of the student body is what 
makes the school a fine one. I think 
that the danger here lies in the carry­
ing of vocation and the national side 
of life too far. There are other aims 
and a student should not always think 
of his vocation at the expense of his 
character.”

DEANS’ COLUMN.
LETTER FROM DEAN 
CONNELLY.
December 15, 1913. 
To the Editor of the Tartan.
One of the hopeful signs of the 
times and a matter which has become 
a live issue of our day, is that of 
“Safety First.” Too much attention 
cannot be given this subject and I 
feel that it is of special importance to 
the young men in our Schools. It 
is my firm conviction that if the les­
son of safety be learned as part of the 
education for life, a great step in ad­
vance will be made towards bettering 
much of the so-called industrial evils. 
It is for this reason that I submit the 
following to the readers of the Tartan.
If self-preservation is the first law 
of nature then the welfare of others 
must come into the same category as 
a matter of common honesty. Too 
often, however, it has required noth­
ing less than the bitterest sort of an 
experience to stir up that fellow-feel­
ing for another which takes one away 
from himself and shows him that 
somebody else has as much right to 
live as he has; and that he is more 
or less responsible for that life. On 
every hand we are beginning to recog­
nize that the great problem of modern 
existence is to reconcile to modern 
conditions that mighty principle 
founded upon the decalogue itself, 
namely, “Our Duty Toward Others.” 
It is, therefore, of more than passing 
interest and a hopeful sign of the 
times to note just how the world-old 
question “Am I my brother’s keeper?” 
is being answered in terms of highest 
respect for human life in this the 
so-called Industrial Age in which we 
live.
It may be true that much of what 
has been done in the name of Safety 
and Accident Prevention cannot be at­
tributed to any exalted feeling of char­
ity so much as economical considera­
tions, yet the results that have been 
attained and the far-reaching possi­
bilities that lie ahead must convince 
even the most skeptical that the “milk 
of human kindness” is at the bottom 
of the world-wide movement and hence 
its success. It has not been so many 
years since, that the feeling be­
came prevalent that man has no right 
to pile up money over the maimed 
body of his fellow-man. Nor has any 
corporation the right to lose sight of 
its identity, as a combination of hu­
man beings to such an extent as to 
forget that it makes its money by 
means of the brawn and brains of men 
who deserve to live and move in the 
same sphere of safety and comfort as 
the man at the helm.
It is not enough to say sympatheti­
cally “Poor Fellow” when one gets 
hurt in the shop, in the yard, or any­
where while he is on'the job. Nor do 
we do our whole duty when we pay the 
doctor bill or the funeral bill, or furn­
ish money for the upkeep of the fam­
ily, pay accident benefits or hand over 
a pension to the widow and depend­
ents. The sympathy that really counts 
and the service that is most effective 
is that which sees the danger before­
hand and makes provisions to remedy 
it; that provides safeguards wherever 
practical; and that spares no expense 
in enlisting the men at work in a safe­
ty crusade for the mutual benefit of 
all concerned.
It may be of interest, too, to note 
just how the safety idea is awakening 
the public conscience. The ordinary 
layman in this matter may get his first 
idea of it by strolling into an out-of- 
the-way railroad station and noticing 
such signs on the walls as “Get the 
Safety Habit,” “Tell the man with the 
button,” etc. Upon further investi­
gation he will discover that less than 
two decades ago a movement was 
voluntarily inaugurated by one of the 
leading railroad systems of this coun­
try to eliminate, if possible, the num­
ber of accidents and total fatalities 
that occur annually in the field of 
transportation. He will learn that 
owing to this movement many of the 
modern appliances in the form of the 
various makes of brakes and couplings, 
block signals, steel cars and the like 
came into being. And yet he will be 
appalled to know that the number of 
persons killed averages 10,000 per yeai 
and the number of injured no less than 
150,000 on the railroads of this coun­
try alone.
It may so happen, too, if he finds 
himself in the vicinity of mills or man­
ufacturing plants, that he picks up a 
stray yellow envelope, an ordinary pay 
envelope, and his attention will be at­
tracted by a notice printed in flaming 
red which may read as follows: “Use 
safety devices where provided. Don’t 
take a chance.” “Every sign in the 
mill means that the danger pointed out 
is there. You must obey these warn­
ings.” “It is your duty to report un­
safe conditions to your foreman or 
superintendent.” “Your efforts to pre­
vent carelessness, and correct danger­
ous conditions, will make it safer for 
you and your fellow-workman.” Fur­
ther inquiry will reveal the fact that 
many mills and manufacturing plants 
are waging an earnest campaign 
against accident. One of the largest 
steel corporations of this country, no 
less than five years ago, first took ser­
ious notice of this matter and appointed 
a committee to investigate living and 
working conditions of its employees 
and came to the conclusion that it was 
a paying proposition, aside from’ hu­
mane interests, to spend large sums 
of money to improve these conditions 
by devising safety appliances, main­
taining mill hospitals with a corps of 
its own physicians, providing sanitary 
conveniences and to employ safety 
experts—safety engineers, if you please 
—to co-operate with committees of 
foremen and workmen in carrying out 
the idea. In fact the movement has 
spread to such an extent that very few 
of the larger firms can afford to re­
main without.
The many Safety Congresses and 
Conventions that have been held in the 
various cities of the country within 
the past few months, afford evidence 
of how the idea is spreading. An-

school buildings and student activities. These 
calendars make excellent Christmas Gifts and 
furnish a number of photographs which are un­
obtainable anywhere else at the price of this 
calendar, which is $1.00.
other noticeable sign of the times is 
the fact that up until and including 
this year, legislation in the matter of 
safety for the workingman has been 
passed in twenty states; and in seven 
others, bills are now pending and are 
very live issues. Magazines, with spe­
cial Safety supplements, newspapers 
with strong editorials are also taking 
up and pushing the safety propaganda 
with a vim that makes one sit up and 
take notice.
And yet when it is realized that 
every year 2,035,000 workmen are 
killed or injured through accident and 
upon good authority we learn that 50 
per cent of these are preventable, it 
is surely high time to acquire the 
proper respect for human life which 
expresses itself in adopting any means 
that will best conserve this unpar­
donable waste. And when we are told 
by experts that the United States is 
far behind other civilized nations in 
this matter, the unescapable obliga­
tion rests upon us to put out hearts 
into the work and, if possible, get to 
the very sources of human activity 
and life and inculcate primer safety 
lessons as early as the human mind is 
able to grasp the idea. This will do 
more towards revolutionizing the 
danger element in life than any single 
agency.
Since universal experience points to 
education as the effective remedy for 
the greater number of industrial acci­
dents, why not then carry the story 
of “Safety First” into the public 
schools all over the land? A start has 
been made in some sections of the 
country in the form of fire drills, first 
aid instruction and the like.
To bring the matter home, no better 
opportunity to work out and study 
the safety idea at first hand can be 
had than right here in our own schools.

Letter from Dean Connelly
Continued from Page 5.
For if practical education prepares for 
the practical in life, it ought to do 
it under circumstances that will pro­
tect that life against possible injuries 
and accidents common to industrial 
and certain form of professional life. 
Hence, here, if all places, the value of 
safety appliances should be demon­
strated by practical precept; care 
should be exercised in teaching care 
for others and every safeguard should 
be installed in the shop, and more 
particularly in the mind of every 
single student.
Indeed, as far as I could find out, 
no Technical Institute or Educational 
Institute of any kind has taken the 
matter quite so seriously as has the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
The following is a brief sketch of the 
history of the movement:
From the opening of school for reg­
ular sessions in October, 1905, to June, 
1907, a period of \l/2 years 84 acci­
dents, fortunately none of a very seri­
ous nature, including accidents to stu­
dents for the greater part, also work­
ingmen around the building and nine 
faculty members, were reported. They 
can be enumerated as follows:
21 on the campus, lecture rooms and 
corridors.
7 in the Machine shop.
16 in the Patternshop.
5 in the Plumbing shop.
5 in the Electric wiring shop.
6 in the Foundry.
4 in the Forge shop.
15 in the Chemical Laboratory.
3 in the Bricklaying shop.
2 in the drawing rooms.
Upon the suggestion of the Di­
rector, beginning with September of 
1907 the various members of the Fac­
ulty, more particularly, the heads of 
the shops, began to give Safety talks 
along with their regular courses of 
lectures and it was noticed that the 
number of accidents was lessened ap­
preciatively, but that in the period 
1907 to 1910 some of the worst acci­
dents in the history of the school hap­
pened. This led to the organization 
of a Committee on Safety Appliances 
in 1910 in the School of Applied In­
dustries, which committee has been at 
work for three years and is composed 
of practical men—head instructors in 
the various shops,, an instructor in 
academic subjects who serves in writ­
ing reports and drawing up specifica­
tions, and an instructor in mechanical 
drawing, the latter to make the neces­
sary drawings in compliance with the 
recommendations of the committee. 
This committee has made 63 recom­
mendations along the lines of preven­
tion of accident in the various shops, 
laboratories and lecture rooms, 47 of 
which have been accepted and 16 
which have either not been completed 
or held under advisement. In the last 
two years the number of accidents 
have cut down to twelve, as follows:
2 in the Pattern shop.
1 in the Foundry.
1 in the Carpenter shop.
2 in the Chemical laboratory.
6 in the Corridors, Lecture rooms 
and campus.

or any similar functions given by Carnegie Tech Students

In the last year the total number of 
accidents was cut down in two.
It is the opinion of the committee 
on Safety Appliances that more good 
is accomplished by systematic lectures 
on Safety than can be secured by the 
mere installation of Safety appliances.

CHARETTE.
The way of the trangressor is 
hard,” sighed “Bud” Milton, as he 
wrote Pilgrims Progress, and the 
Senior Mechanicals are of the same 
opinion, or at least they have been 
since they finished last Saturday even­
ing’s charette. Many have been the 
resolutions since then to keep Steam 
Power Plants up to date in the future, 
to say nothing about Dynamics. How­
ever, it is dangerously near New 
Years, so there is great danger of the 
afore mentioned resolutions going the 
same way that all New Years resolu­
tions should go, that is be forgotten 
at the earliest possible moment.
The charette began at six P. <M. on 
Saturday evening, and ended sometime 
Sunday, although just when has not 
been made public for fear of “Billy” 
Sunday’s wrath, should he hear of the 
performance.
The drawing room was fitted up 
with a system of gas lights designed 
especially for the occasion, by the well 
known “engineer?” J. B. Patterson, 
?nd it was such a success that it will 
probably be used exclusively on all 
such future occasions, provided cast 
iron mantels are put on the market 
before then.
Promptly at one o’clock an inter­
mission was cailed and supper was 
served. As soon as the supper had 
been absorbed a game of cards was 
started It might be mentioned that 
this game was also created especially 
lor the occasion and was termed 1000, 
instead of 500, for it was the same as 
500 except that two packs of cards 
were used, and it was eight handed. 
At the end of the game no one had a 
score of more than minus 700.
At this point the reporter went to 
sleep, so anyone wanting further de­

Carnegie Talks About Home Town
Continued from Page 1 
and see for himself the strides that 
have been taken.
The Technical Schools and the Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie School for 
Women seemed nearer to the heart 
of the old steel master than any of 
his other benefactions. That the 
schools will receive further financial 
aid from their founder could not be 
doubted and, if his enthusiasm can be 
taken as a guide, the big institution
that overlooks Schenley Park and the 
Oakland district will be bountifully 
remembered before the laird closes his 
purse strings for all time.
“What can you say to Pittsburgh 
regarding the Technical Schools and 
their future?” was asked Mr. Carnegie.
“Don’t you think the schools speak 
for themselves?” he replied. “It seems 
useless for me to discuss them. But 
I must say I did talk of their future 
with Arthur Hamerschlag and Char­
ley Taylor in New York last Monday 
and Tuesday. We went over the 
whole situation, and I was pleased 
with what I heard.
“Director Hamerschlag told me they 
would be able to accommodate 200 
more students next year with the ad­
ditional equipment now being pro­
vided. I’m satisfied that this splendid 
institution will continue to grow and 
expand, reaching out after worthy 
boys and men and equipping them to 
fight the battles of life.”
“You know, of course, Mr. Carnegie, 
of the 1,000 poor boys who are strug­
gling at Tech to get an education, 
and how 758 of them have earned 
$260,422 and continued their studies?
“Do I know of these deeds of self- 
sacrifice?” he replied. “Why, of 
course I do. I know what all the 
boys and girls are doing, the same 
as I know what the faculty is doing. 
These boys who labor through the 
day or night and attend Technical 
Schools when they can are future 
presidents. I’ve been reading in the 
Pittsburgh papers of one who worked 
three hours a day while the others 
slept, went to school eight hours, and 
put in every Saturday at some task 
which yielded him money. But I pre­
dict that that boy won’t do it long. 
The world is patiently waiting for 
such a boy to develop into a man. He’ll 
climb fast once he starts.
“I want you to tell the city author­
ities of Pittsburgh how highly we ap­
preciate the help that has been ex­
tended to the Carnegie Library. I 
note Librarian Craver needs 45,000 
new books for next year to meet the 
demands of students and others.
“They tell me the Council has fixed 
upon $197,000 for the library for 1914, 
which, I believe, is an increase over 
the allowance for the current year.
I have no complaint to make, for I 
know Council will do the proper thing 
by the library.
Mr. Carnegie while here told a story 
of his recent gift of a stained glass 
window to Dunfermline Cathedral, 
which the recipients could not accept 
for the historic edifice.
Several years ago Mr. Carnegie 
made up his mind to donate a window 
as a memorial to his father and mother 
and deceased brother and sister, to be 
installed in the great cathedral. He 
called in the artists and artisans of 
the Tiffany studio to perform the 
work, and when it was completed Mr. 
Carnegie had the beautiful window 
shipped across the water to Dunferm­
line. Now the municipal guardians of 
the ancient cathedral have refused to 
accept the gift.
“They came to me,” said Mr. Car­
negie, “and told me that the Tiffany
window would not do; it was too mod­
ern altogether for the rest of the 
building, which is more than 800 years 
old.
“I have determined to install the 
window in the public library of Dun­
fermline. It will be a more intinj,ate 
and personal thing to do this, for my 
father instituted the first circulating 
library in Dunfermline many years 
ago. The Dunfermline Library was 
the first that I established.”—Gazette 
Times.
THE JUNIOR PROM.
After much trouble the date of the 
Prom of 1914 has been set. The Prom 
will be held in the Rittenhouse on the 
20th day of February, 1914. This date 
was the only one that could be found 
that would suit more than half the 
students. It is Friday night, the first 
Friday of the second semester.
From the amount of interest taken 
in the selecting of the date on the 
part of the student body, we are ready 
to predict the largest and best Prom 
in the history of Carnegie. In order 
to make this the best Prom ever the 
present Junior Class will have to show 
up to a man. The Proms in the past 
have been the bright places in the 
students’ lives. We are sure that 
this year will be the brightest, so 
bright that one will have to wear 
dark glasses. So get busy, fellows, and 
ask “her” to the Prom on the 20th of 
February.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi­
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom’ 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re­
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.
“The Honeymoon Express” from 
the New York Winter Garden with 
A1 Jolson, the really funny black face 
comedian at the head of the original 
cast w'hich includes Melville Ellis, 
Juliette Dika, Ada Lewis, Anna 
Wheaton, Ray Samuels, Doyle & Dix­
on, Donald McDonald, F. Owen Bax­
ter, and a chorus of eighty, will be the 
Christmas week attraction at the Al­
vin theatre. This engagement will be­
gin on Monday evening next and will 
include in addition to the regular 
Wednesday and Saturday matinees, 
added matinees 011 Thursday and Fri­
day.
“The Honeymoon Express” was a 
great success in New York. In its 
catchy music, pretty costumes, novel­
ties and opportunities for its clever 
cast of musical comedy entertainers, 
it is said to be a typical Winter Gar­
den piece, with a touch of spectacle and 
melodrama added.
THE GRAND.
An especially interesting feature oF
the Christmas week program of re­
fined vaudeville at the Grand Opera 
House, beginning Dec. 22, will be the 
presentation of a comedy playlet from 
the pen of C. H. O’Donnell, author 
of “Flashlight Cragin.” The playlet 
is entitled “Liz,” and will be enacted 
by Frederika Slemons and Company. 
Five or six other attractive features 
make the Grand’s Christmas week bill 
one of the most enticing of the pres­
ent season.
DUQUESNE

Mr. Harry Davis has arranged for a
