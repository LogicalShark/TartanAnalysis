Fine Arts Forum 
Begins Activities 
In Little Theater
Votja Benes, distinguished edu- 
cator, will speak at a joint assem­
bly and meeting of the newlj 
formed Arts Forum today at 11:30 
in the Little Theatre, Cdllege of 
Fine Arts. His topic is “Fed­
eralization of Central Europe. Mr. 
Benes’ subject is particularly 
apropos at this time because of the 
great interest in whether the na­
tions of Europe will wish to umte 
in a federal system after the pres­
ent war. This federation is a 
possible solution to the political 
and economical difficulties that 
beset the Central European na­
tions, and Mr. Benes, with his 
first hand experience, will have a 
practical viewpoint to offer.
Democratic Educator
Mr. Benes is an elder brother 
of Dr. Eduard Benes, former pres­
ident of Czechoslovakia. He was 
graduated from the Teacher’s In­
stitute of Prague ,and began tech- 
ing in 1897. With his ideas of 
democratic education, he quickly 
rose to the position of inspector- 
general of schools. In 1913 he vis^ 
ited here to study our public 
school system.
Returning to Bohemia, he was 
drafted into the Austrian army. 
He refused to fight for the op­
pressors of his people; so he es­
caped to this country, and join­
ed the cause of an independent 
Czechoslovakia. When the new 
government was formed in his 
native land, he devoted himself 
to the development of its schools. 
Elected to the national assembly 
in 1924, he took advantage of the 
opportunity to extend educational 
facilities through legislation.
At the time of the Munich Con­
ference, he was traveling again in 
this country, and lectured on the 
tragic consequences which result­
ed in the dismemberment of.his 
country. He returned once more 
to Czechoslovakia, and had to flee 
in June, 1939, at the time of the 
Nazi entry.
Dr. Nathan Miller, professor of 
Economics, who was to address the 
Forum’s initial meeting, will 
present his discussion at a later 
date.

newly formed Arts Forum con­
sists of the following: Painting

Mrs. Patterson 
Assumes Duties 
As Union Hostess
Under a new arrangement, 
Mrs. Patterson, formerly in charge 
of the Graduate House on Mar­
garet Morrison Street, has assum­
ed duties as hostess of the Car­
negie Union. Mrs. Reger, former­
ly house mother at Hawthorne, 
will take charge of the Graduate 
House.
The arrangement also involves 
the closing of Hawthorne Hall, one 
of the four Freshmen Women 
Dormitories, for the rest of the 
semester. Of the six girls who 
formerly lived there, two moved 
into Laurel Hall, three into Cy­
press Hall, and one into Forbes 
Hall.
This change was made for two 
reasons, namely: 1) Since there 
are so few girls living in the 
dorm, Mrs. Yon, Assistant to the 
Dean of Students, felt that they 
were missing out on real dorm­
itory life such as is found in a 
more populated dormitory. 2) The 
Administration felt that there 
were too few freshmen dorm stu­
dents this year to warrant the up­
keep of the extra house.
Exams for Radio 
Inspectors Given
The U. S. Civil Service Com­
mission has announced examin­
ations to fill the positions of radio 
and assistant radio inspectors in 
the Federal Communications Com­
mission at $2000 to $2600 a year.
The duties of these positions 
involve radio inspection work of 
all kinds, including inspecting ra­
dio equipment on shops, on air­
craft and at various land sta­
tions to determine compliance 
with government specifications. 
Applicants must have completed 
4 years of college' study in elec­
trical engineering or in physics. 
In addition, applicants must have 
had experience in working with 
radio transmitters, or must have 
completed certain graduate study 
in- communication engineering.
Radio inspector applicants must 
also hold a first-class radio-tele­
graph operator’s license (or dem­
onstrate that they can receive and 
transmit at the rate of 25 words 
a minute. Application forms may 
be obtained from the Secretary of 
the Board of U. S. Civil Service 
Commission or at any first or sec­
ond class post office. Applications 
must be filed at the Civil Service 
Commission’s Washington office 
not later than March 6.
Big Sister Interviews
Notices for interviews have been 
sent to the junior and senior Tech 
v girls who are acting as Big Sis­
ters to the freshman girls. These 
interviews have already begun, 
and Mrs. Yon, Assistant to the 
Dean of Students, requests that Big 
Sisters make it a point to see her 
for their interviews.
The interviews are cunciucted in 
order that these junior and sen­
ior girls may give a report of the 
progress their Little Sisters are 
making thus far in their college 
careers.
Tartan Presents 
A Sneak Preview
By Thomas Wood Batten
The Drama Department, having 
served up a piece of cold, un­
digested storage turkey cooked up 
by J. B. Priestly, is now ready to 
spread before us a mammoth feast 
called “Dawn in Lyonesse.” Orig­
inally a novel by Mary Ellen 
Chase, “Dawn in Lyonesse” has 
been made into a play by Thomas 
Job of the Carnegie Tech Drama 
Faculty. He has directed the 
present production — the first the 
script has had.
Mr. Job has attempted to trans­
late the Tristam legend into com­
monplace realities. The Iseult of 
“Dawn in Lyonesse” is a waitress 
in a resort hotel; hfer Tristram is a 
Cornish fisherman. The problem 
of the playwright has been to re­
produce the great romantic and 
heroic legend in prosaic terms. 
This transposition has been emin­
ently successful. In the first act 
we are convinced that we are to 
see a conventionally realistic 
drama. Gradually and somewhat 
insidiously, however, mystical and 
super-natural elements creep in, 
until finally what began as a drab 
little piece has developed into a 
tragedy of classical proportions.
By opening night the perform­
ance will be much improved, but 
the run-through I saw the other 
day was well done, and the actors 
exhibited a great amount of self- 
assurance, for the most part. El­
len, the heroine, was being re­
hearsed by a rather angular girl 
with a I-Iepburnesque quality. In 
her emotional scenes she was su­
perbly sincere and exciting. The 
“other woman,” Susan, was an at­
tractive girl who played with ad-

Council has announced an elec­
tion today for Senior Represen­
tative from Arts School, to be 
held from 11:30 to 1:30. Those 
candidates that have presented 
their petitions to the Council of­
fice are Lillian Dorsey, Drama 
1941, and Geraldine Hamman, 
Music 1941. The question of the 
eligibility of Einar Jacobson was 
also brought up at the meeting 
and will be determined after he 
has taken the re-exams.
Arts students — Don’t forget to 
vote today . . . 11:30 to 1:30 . . . 
athletic cards are necessary.
A second plan was also discuss­
ed at the meeting: Mr. Sions’ plan 
for the reorganization of the men’s 
honoraries. After deliberation by 
the committee of three which had 
studied the plan, Mr. Sions 
agreed to reduce his factor re­
quirement from 2.5 to 2.00. The 
second point of dispute, which 
concerns dues and initiation 
fees, is still unsettled. Rather 
than arbitrarily withdraw recog­
nition of the existing constitutions 
of the honoraries and use the plan 
in their place, Mr. Cullen suggest­
ed that the honoraries be given 
two weeks to draw up new con­
stitutions and, if the organizations 
in question did not comply with 
this request, recognition of their 
constitutions be withdrawn. In 
the drafting of these constitutions, 
Mr. Sions’ plan is to be used as a 
guide.
President Floyd reported to 
Council at this time that Carnegie 
Tech is on the local union’s or­
chestra black list and asked Mr. 
Durbin and Mr. Jacobson to in­
vestigate the matter further, es­
pecially in connection with the 
action of the national union. The 
meeting closed, with the drawing 
of lots to choose delegates for the 
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Stu­
dent Government Association 
Conference which will be held at 
Penn State on February 21,. 22, 
and 23. Three delegates are to be 
sent, Mr. Floyd automatically go­
ing as one of them. The results 
of the drawing will be announced 
at the meeting which is scheduled 
for 7:00 tonight in the Student 
Union.

Dear Friends:
The camp where I am staying 
is built on an open beach, in 
deep coarse sand; not a tree, not 
a bit of grass, and the cold winds 
from the mountains sweep across 
it in frequent snowstorms. Row 
after row of squat gray wood bar­
racks, partly covered with tar­
paper, set in the sand, with only 
the sand for floor; each sector 
surrounded by a ten-foot field of 
tangled barbed wire. There is no 
artificial light in these huts, no 
heat, and, save in the women’s 
camp, no beds. Men sleep on the 
sand, and most of them have no 
bedding save the clothes they 
wear all the time.
The one exception to this rule 
is a small sector where the work­
ing parties live. They may have 
beds, if they can provide them. 
And the result is motely—some 
beds consist of a bit of cotton 
blanket tacked on a frame. One 
man I saw had found a sheet of 
corrugated iron roofing, managed 
to bend a foot of it down at right 
angles to the rest, tacked the long 
end to the wall, and the short, 
piece made a support at the foot.
The result was only about four 
feet long, so that its owner could 
not. stretch out on it. but at least 
he was off the vermin-infested 
sand. Some of these men and 
women have been living here for 
two years or more.
Like the corrugated iron bed, 
any bit of furniture is the sheer­
est luxury. Unless one’s family or 
friends have sent him a tin plate, 
knife, fork, and spoon, a man here 
must eat with his fingers, out of 
any old tin can available. I watch­
ed one of these camps moving to 
another place the other day, and 
noted the pitiful baggage they car­
ried; old food cans, turned into 
crude buckets, a few thin blank­
ets. Every once in a while in the 
line, a man carried a rude tab­
ouret; you might use it for kind­
ling to start a fire at home. Here 
it is a valuable item. One of my 
friends, just x’eleased from such 
a camp, told me of how he saved 
his reason by buying a tabouret. 
With this he could go out into 
a comer of the barbed wire en­
closure, sit, not stand, and read his 
Bible, thus escaping from the con­
stant coming and going and hub­
bub in his barrack, shared v/ith 
one hundred other men.
Men were selling and bartering 
all sorts of primitive possessions, 
their wares in their hands or 
spread on the ground. One had 
a half dozen sandwiches—slices 
of coarse broad, each with a salt 
sardine on it. Several sold hot 
chestnuts, their entire stock would

Dr. T. Z. Koo, a former rail­
road executive in China, who 
gave up his position to work with 
the Young Men’s and Young 
Women’s Christian Association, 
will be the chapel speaker next 
Tuesday. A world citizen, rather 
than a nationalist, Dr. Koo “In­
terprets the Christian message 
with the practical directness of 
the West, the wealth of Orient in­
sight, and the outlook of world 
statesmanship.”
Reputed to be one of the most 
inspiring and prophetic speakers 
that has ever addressed college 
and university groups, Dr. Koo 
has spoken with students in Aus­
tralia, New Zealand, India, Java, 
and China, as well as to many of 
the important universities, civic, 
and church assemblies throughout 
the U. S. A. and Canada. Ile will

been placed on the union black­
list. This ruling by the union was 
made after the Evening School 
Council had hired a CIO union 
band for one of its dances several 
weeks ago.
Communication aoout the. 
school’s listing came through the 
president of the local union, Mr. 
Clare Meeder. Mr. Meeder has 
sent the facts in the case to the 
national headquarters of the un­
ion, requesting a ruling concern­
ing Tech’s national standing. This 
ruling, which should be received 
this week, will decide whether or 
not big name bands will be avail­
able for future social functions.
The first effects of the local un­
ion were felt last week when the 
inter-honorary fraternity council 
tried to hire a union band for its 
dance last Saturday night. Since 
no union band was allowed to ac­
cept the position, a non-union 
band was hired. This move by the 
union indicates that it wishes to 
stop all our social functions until 
we agree to sign up with them.
Tom Durbin, chairman of the 
committee appointed by Mr. Floyd 
to investigate the situation will 
report his findings to Council to­
night.

Student Council, last week receiv­
ed notice from the musician’s un­
ion, AFL, that Carnegie Teel) had
fill a quart jar. One displayed a 
dozen tiny, shriveled apples. Ar­
ticles of used clothing were be­
ing exchanged: shirts, and socks 
and handkerchiefs, and there was 
one counter with a dozen of these 
model planes, the only item in the 
market, representing any thing 
but the most elemental ability.
In the commandant’s office I 
met Jose, 17 years old, beautiful 
spiritual face, great dark eyes, a 
cautious friendly smile. There is 
a small scar, on his cheek; he was 
one of a group of Republican sol­
diers captured by the Whites in 
Spain, stood against a wall and 
mowed down by machine-gun fire. 
Anyone still kicking after the ma­
chine gun, was finished off by a 
bullet from an officer’s pistol. 
In Jose’s case the projectile went 
in under the jaw and came out 
through his cheek, and he lived 
to crawl away and rejoin his 
comrades. He was fourteen then. 
Now he is entering his third year 
of prison camps.
The camp leader showed us a 
group of barracks devastated by 
recent floods. Here the camp gar­
rison used to live, and the bar­
racks had floors. But1now there is 
eight inches of mud on the top 
of them. The leader has been giv­
en the job of cleax*ing up this 
mess, and he and his men are do­
ing it gladly, since then they may 
move into these better living 
quarters. The tons of mud are be­
ing dumped into-a nearby field to

Why Not Talk 
Things Over?
,NN lNnS SGoOF 7CAN as w
The friction which recently developed with the Pittsburgh 
Local of the American Federation of Musicians is still not settled. 
Every day which passes without prospect of settlement tends to 
make matters worse. On the one hand it tends to create a re­
sentful attitude on the part of students which would make nego­
tiation difficult. On the other hand it threatens the intervention 
of the National Union with consequent complications.
The present difficulties began when the Evening School hired 
a C. I. 0. orchestra for one of its dances. According to Mr. 
Meeder, President of the Pittsburgh Local, this was the culmin­
ation of a series ol! “offenses” by the Evening School—the fre­
quent hiring of non-union bands—and the Union felt that the 
source of irritation could only be removed if Evening School 
would agree to hire union bands exclusively.
In withholding the use of union orchestras from student 
dances, the Pittsburgh Local has included both Day School and 
Interfraternity Council with the Evening School in a blanket 
ban. The case has been presented to the National Union for con­
sideration. The National is expected to decide shortly whether 
it will extend this ban nationally. This move would exclude all 
“naine-bands” from the Tech campus and would seriously ham­
per plans for Spring Carnival and other important affairs. In­
tervention by the national’ office would certainly make negotia­
tions with the union more involved.
Since no formal negotiations have actually taken place and 
since neither side has made its position clear publicly, some mis­
taken impressions have been circulated as rumors. For exam­
ple, it is untrue that the union is demanding that Tech hire 
fewer national bands to give local musicians work. The union’s 
demands would in 001 way affect the number or calibre of “name 
bands” appearing on the Tech campus. The same thing is true 
with regard to the rumor that the union insists that union orches­
tras play for all affairs, including the tea-dances and fraternity 
house-dances. Mr. Meeder told representatives of the student 
body that the union has no intention of interfering in the present 
arrangements on such affairs and that the union would not object 
to the employment of non-union orchestras for these smaller af­
fairs.
There is actually no controversy between Day Student Coun­
cil and the Union. The same is true of Interfraternity Coun­
cil. Both organizations are now in a position to sign a contract as 
requested by the union without changing in any way the present 
relations with the union.
The attitude of the Evening Student Council, as explained by 
Mr. Fisher, its president, is that it will not sign a contract agree­
ing to use A. F. of L. bands exclusively. It believes that union 
bands should be required to compete with non-union bands 100 
the basis of quality and price.
The situation has been further complicated by the request 
of the union for a contract to be signed by some member of the 
administration. Since the matter involved is of student con­
cern, Council has correctly answered that it could not and would 
not ask any school official to intervene.
The matter can undoubtedly be settled without administra­
tion intervention, if a joint committee, representing both day 
and evening schools were formed to meet with the union, all 
disagreements Avould probably be ironed out in a short time t,o 
our mutual satisfaction.
The present ambiguous situation is harmful, not only because 
of its inconvenience, but because it involves the name of the 
school in unfavorable publicity. The. sooner a committee to 
negotiate the disagreement is formed and the sooner the con­
troversy is amicably settled, the better it will be for all concerned.

monotony. Derek, the apex of this 
Cornish triangle (Melchoir does 
this at the Met), was played by a 
newly-moustachioed lad who suc­

safely predict, will be well-acted.
Of extreme annoyance to me, 
however, were three British golf­
ers—British as the Brooklyn

wrong note can throw an entire

these golfers appeared, their 
Americanese cluttered up the at­
mosphere. In contrast to these 
campus Englishmen, there, was a 
vague young man who exuded 
charm and spoke in a somewhat 
authentic British accent; he was 
supposed to be an American uni­

are minor, though, and will doubt­
less be attended to before the play 
opens.

The Thistle staff is especially 
eager to obtain photos taken the 
night of the funeral march stag­
ed by Tech students before the 
Pitt-Tech game. While none have 
yet been turned in featuring this 
aspect of the Homecoming week­
end, the Thistle makes this ap­
peal, feeling that some reader may 
have some such snapshot.
Naturally, other photos of typ­
ical school scenes that will be of 
interest to the general student 
body will be accepted. Fraterni­
ties having photographs of their 
houses dressed up for that week­
end are urged to add them to the 
growing pile in the box in the 
office of the Dean of Men. This 
policy of opening the Thistle pag­
es to the student body at large is 
in keeping with the idea to pre­
sent an annual of interest to more 
of the student body. Any student 
may contribute by placing photos 
in this collection box which will 
remain in the Dean’s office for the 
week of Feb. 16 through 22nd. 
Photos not used will be returned 
to the owner if he will sign his 
name upon the reverse side of the 
snapshot.
Intersorority Formal 
Held at Hotel Schenley

Intersorority Formal, one of the 
big dances of the year, will be 
held this Friday evening in Hotel 
Schenley from the hours of 9:00 
to 1:00. The dance, sponsored by 
Intersorority Council, will feature 
George King and his orchestra, 
from Cleveland, Ohio. George’s 
orchestra is one of the best. He 
has played at Bill Green’s twice, 
last spring and last fall, and suc­
ceeded in boosting attendance 
numbers.
George King features sweet mu^- 
sic, although he has been known 
to digress into both slow and hot 
music. One would expect this, due 
to the fact that George, himself, 
used to be a drummer. The or­
chestra has broadcast over both 
the Columbia and Mutual net­
works; and took part in a theater 
tour sponsored by RKO in which 
it played at Warner Brother’s the­
aters.
George, as manager for Sammy 
Kaye, originated the slogan
. . . zNoOAN J3lA
“Swing and Sway with Sammy 
Kaye.;’ He was also personal 
manager for Rita Rio, girl band 
leader. George discovered Bill 
Butterfield, who is now 1st 
trumpet player with Artie Shaw. 
He also picked his two excellent 
vocalists, Bud Dowling and Bill 
Ashey.
The proceeds of the Formal are 
to go for a scholarship which the 
Council awards each year to the 
sorority member deemed most 
worthy by a board composed of 
Dean Warden, Mrs. Yon, Mr. 
Keeble and Director Watkins. This 
•year’s scholarship went to Sally 
Williams, a member of Kappa Phi 
Delta.
Although favors will not be 
given, novelty programs will be 
on hand. Advisers of the follow­
ing sororities will attend the 
dance: Alpha Kappa Psi, Alpha 
Theta Sigma, Beta. Pi Beta, Tau 
Lambda, Gamma Gamma Gam­
ma, Gamma Phi Sigma and Kap­
pa Phi Delta.
Tickets for the dance will te 
$3.00 per couple. The dance is in 
complete charge of B. A. Richards, 
chairman of the affair, and tick­
ets may he obtained from any 
member olSthe Council. The dance 
is private.
Review
Scotch ’n’ Soda 
Practice Coming
“See, it’s simple, a cinch—one, 
two, three—all right now, let’s try 
it,” so spoke Roland Kraus, dance 
director of Scotch and Soda. And 
believe it or not, the chorus did 
do it, with that uncanny knack 
that they have of picking up a 
difficult step the first time they 
see it. They’re one of the hardest 
working bunches in the show, but 
are rewarded by having the most 
fun. Rehearsals are held twice a 
week, Wednesday and Saturday, 
and at the moment they are a 
month ahead of schedule. Their 
work is a cooperative effort on the 
part of all concerned, for they all 
enjoy dancing. Certainly from all 
appearances, Scotch and Soda’s 
chorus will help make “Here’s to 
You” a sure-fire hit.
Assisting Roily, as assistant 
dance directors will be Jeane 
Hering, a Sophomore in the Cos­
tume Economics Department, and 
Adelyne Roth, Freshman Dra­
matic student. Jeane appeared in 
last year’s Scotch and Soda show, 
and Adelyne danced in last sea­
son’s Pittsburgh Playhouse pro­
duction, “Thank Your Stars,” a 
musical comedy. Both girls show 
considerable talent and should 
definitely aid Roily with the rou­
tines.
And so with the dance ability 
well taken care of, Jack -Purcell, 
’41, musical director, and the 
Scotch and Soda Club have sent 
out the first call for anyone in­
terested in arranging, singing, or 
composing for “Here’s to You.” 
Try-outs will be held tomorrow 
at 4:30 in the Exhibition Room 
of the Fine Arts Building.

•jnake a kitchen garden. Their one 
regret at moving here is that this 
group will have to leave their 
“library,” constructed with great 
devotion in that part of the camp 
where they now live. Th§re are 
rude benches there, and tables, 
and a blackboard, so that classes 
and lectures can be held. The 
store of books consists of the small 
remnant of a large collection 
furnished by the American Quak­
ers, which was mostly distribut­
ed among working parties sent out 
during the war. These were 
caught in occupied territory and 
have not been heard from since.
In the women’s camp there are 
two thousand women, children, 
and adolescent boys who do the 
camp chores. Here conditions are 
slightly better because the bar­
racks have floors, and there are 
rude benches to serve as beds. 
Eighty to a hundred women and. 
children crowded into one room 
do not offer much privacy. The 
Quakers • and a Swiss organiza­
tion furnish a small amount of 
milk daily for the younger' chil­
dren. There is also a children’s 
school housed in a couple of bar­
racks at one edge of the camp.
At the side of the camp next the 
men’s section a row of women sat 
in the sand, or stood against their 
side of the ten-foot bed of barbed 
wire, talking to men leaning 
against the wire on their side. 
In some ways such near contact 
is more terrible than if men and 
women were in completely dif­
ferent parts of the . country.
At another camp, I watched the 
arrival of four thousand crowd­
ed, cowed refugees from the Ger­
man Palatinate. You cannot im­
agine the misery; old, old women, 
fragile and trembling,' crippled 
old men, helped along by younger 
folk, herded, more or less gently, 
by French gendarmes, using a 
language these people from Ger­
many could not understand.
While I waited and watched, I 
began to wonder what I would 
do if I were suddenly put into a 
camp like this. I strolled up and 
down in front of the Comman­
dant’s office, watching the ragged 
maii in the Spanish section slog- 
the mud, behind 
v/s of barbed wire.
I tried to imagine 
place, the less I 
seemed able to think construc­
tively. A sort of panic seized me 
and I wanted to get away from 
there, just as soon as I could.
Defense Work Here

Down in the basement of In­
dustries Hall, behind locked doors, 
vital work is being done in the na­
tion’s defense program. The Gage 
Laboratory is the scene of import­
ant measurements and inspections 
of fine mechanical instruments 
used by the United States Army to 
(insure effectiveness of combat de­
vices.
The work of the gage labora­
tory is under the direction of the 
United States Ordnance Depart­
ment. For those unfamiliar with 
the term, the Ordnance Depart­
ment is an Army service which 
¦provides for the manufacture, pro­
curement, research, design, con­
trol and maintenance of all ord­
nance material. “Ordnance ma­
terial,” to further define terms, 
consists of all ammunition, guns, 
fire control equipment, and tanks 
used in combat. The term does 
not include any items other than 
•those used for combat.
To facilitate the progress of its 
¡work, the Ordnance Department 
divides the country into fifteen so- 
called “procurement districts.” In 
each of these procurement dis­
tricts, the government establishes 
a “control point,” for the inspec­
tion of ordnance material manu­
factured in its district. The pro­
cedure followed entails negotiat­
ing to obtain laboratory space in 
the most centrally located college 
of each district. In 1937, the War 
Pepartment established its gage 
laboratory for the Pittsburgh Ord­
nance District here at Carnegie 
Tech.
Every piece of combat equip­
ment accepted by the government 
must be inspected before being 
bought. This inspection is cai’ried 
on through the use of gages, 
which are mechanical devices for 
showing the relative size or shape 
of the object.
Gages are “limiting” instru­
ments, and hence must be more 
accurate than the object to be 
tested. Let us take, for example, 
the case of measuring the length 
and other dimensions of a cart­
ridge shell. If the shell must be 
accurate to .001 inch, then the 
gage with which it is measured, 
must be accurate to .0001 inch. 
Correspondingly, the equipment 
used to measure the gage, must be
accurate to .00001 inch.
This high degree of precision 
is absolutely necessary in the in­
spection of ordnance material. Ac­
tually, the gage laboratory here 
at Carnegie is capable of making 
determinations to an accuracy of 
two to five millionths of an inch.
The basic control units are 
“gage blocks,” which are small 
blocks of metal calibrated at the 
Bureau of Standards in Washing­
ton, D. C. These gage blocks are 
measured with light waves, and 
are accurate to within two mil­
lionths of an inch. All instruments 
are set from these gage blocks.
The Carnegie Tech gage labor­
atory, being the central control 
point for ordnance material man­
ufactured in the Pittsburgh Ord­
nance District is essentially re­
sponsible for the ultimate accur­
acy of all of the inspection work 
done by the Ordnance Department 
in this district.
In charge of this vital work here 
at Carnegie is a personable young 
army officer, Lieutenant Rush A. 
Bowman. Lt. Bowman is an alum­
nus of the University of Michi­
gan, where he was graduated as a 
Mechanical Engineer. He obtained 
his commission as a lieutenant in 
the Ordnance Department while 
at Michigan.
Two assistants to Lt. Bowman 
help him carry on the work of 
the laboratory. Mr. Charles Doerr 
had been an inspector of Johnson- 
Bronze Co., in New Castle, Pa. 
Mr. Raymond Peckham, the other 
laboratory assistant, was form­
erly employed as an inspector by 
International Harvester Co., in 
Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Because of the confidential na­
ture of-the, work being carried on, 
students are not permitted to en­
ter the laboratory except on offi­
cial business, or by permission of 
those in charge. In regard to this 
restriction, Lt. Bowman has made 
.the following statement:
“We regret we are not able to 
give personal tours of the labora­
tory, nor are we able to be host 
to an open house for students in 
Carnegie. Due to the national em­
ergency, such orders have been 
issued by the office of the Chief of 
Ordnance in Washington, D. C.”
By Gilbert Kivenson
War has been declared on Pitts­
burgh smoke. In the last few 
weeks, hundreds- of people have 
expressed their enthusiasm and 
have even offered to help in the 
campaign. Few realize, however, 
that a chance remark by an oth-
, . . ­CO.3l Is ­CFNOS
erwise obscure research worker 
at Carnegie Tech was the spark 
which started the engine of smoke 
abatement rolling.
Five years ago Martin A. May­
ers of the Coal Research Labora­
tory spoke before one of the sci­
ence groups on campus. His top­
ic was concerned with the mech­
anism of combustion. Mr. Mayers 
stated that smoke was not a neces­
sary concomitant of combustion 
if the matter were considered 
from a purely chemical stand­
point. The Tartan, when print­
ing an account of the lecture, em­
phasized the latter statement and 
suggested the possibility of apply­
ing the principle to Pittsburgh 
smoke.
A short time later, Mr. Mayers 
received a call from Mrs. Enoch 
Rauh, wealthy philanthropist. 
She had read the article, clipped 
it, and had resolved to “de-smog” 
the city. She wanted to know it 
Mr. Mayers would help her. 
Amazed at the results of a seem­
ingly unimportant statement, Mr. 
Mayers weakly replied that he 
would do all he could to aid in 
the work. He soon found himself
a member of a committee which 
included Mrs. Rauh, ex-Mayor 
Magee, Dr. Chalfont of the Al­
legheny Medical Association, Mr. 
O’Toole of City Council, Miss 
Marie Dermit and Dr. Hope Al­
exander.
Time passed quickly as the 
committe drew up their plan of 
action. City Council was peti­
tioned for an appropriation to 
make an extensive survey of 
smoke conditions with the help 
of the W. P. A. The committee 
received .$3,GOO worth of equip­
ment and set to work.
Standard cans were placed on 
various city buildings to collect 
soot. These were emptied once a 
month and the contents analyzed. 
In other parts of the city electric 
dust counters and jet impingers 
were quantitatively determining 
the amount of grime breathed 
daily by the average Pittsburgh­
er. The reader may remember the 
questionnaires, handed to resi­
dents at the time, which endeav­
ored to determine the “average 
man’s” opinion of and reaction 
toward smoke abatement. The fin­
al report of the committee was 
complete in December of 1939.
Councilman Woik had asked 
City Council to appoint another 
committee to study the results of 
the survey and set up legislation, 
but had obtained no results. The 
Pittsburgh Press then took up the 
battle cry. St. Louis, which had 
done wonders with smoke control 
was visited and its methods of 
abatement described. It was at 
this point a few weeks ago that 
letters of approval began to come 
in from Pittsburghers. Realty 
companies, property-owners as­
sociations, and better business 
leagues have joined in a united 
cause, smoke abatement. All this 
from a chance remark by Martin 
Mayers!
Mr. Mayers thinks that the 
Pittsburgh smoke problem" will be 
a much easier one to solve than 
that of St. Louis, which has been 
forced, to employ drastic regula­
tions. Pennsylvania coal is of a 
much higher grade than Illinois 
coal. When asked what he thought 
of filtering devices on chimneys, 
Mr. Mayers replied, “Smoko must 
bo killed at the source. Tills will 
make for more economical smoke 
control and coal consumption.” A 
coal sales Inspection law will al- 
so be necessary to prevent the
use of higher grade coal from de­
pleting the already-meager purs­
es of poorer Pittsburghers.
Smoke abatement is of import­
ance to Carnegie engineers who 
will have to deal with it if they 
enter any line of production which 
depends on coal as a source of 
heat. Other engineers may be em­
ployed by the city government aa 
inspectors to see that smoko 
abatement measures are carried 
out.
Metallurgists 
Represent Tech 
At NY Convention
Twelve members of the Depart­
ment of Metallurgy and the Met­
als Research Laboratory are at­
tending the 154th meeting of the 
American Institute of Mining 
and Metallurgical Engineers in 
New York City. The convention, 
an annual affair since 1912, ex­
tends from February 17-20.
The technical sessions include 
a number of papers to be present­
ed by members of the Tech dele­
gation. Cyril Wells, Metals Re­
search, and Dr. Robert Mehl, Di­
rector of the Metals Research, 
will present a paper on “Rate of 
Diffusion of Manganese in Gamma 
Iron in Low Carbon and High- 
Carbon Manganese Steels.” A pa­
per on the diffusion of nickel will 
also be reviewed.
Another highlight of the con­
vention is the recently instituted 
annual award to the undergradu­
ates submitting the best papers 
based on their senior theses. This 
year’s award will be given to Wil­
liam Pellini, Tech ’40, at the Din­
ner Meeting of the Board of Di­
rectors of tlie American Institute 
of Mining and Metallurgical En­
gineers. Mr. Pellini is at present 
a member of the Metals Research 
Laboratory.
The competition is so divided 
that three local prizes, carrying a 
stipend of fifty dollars, are award­
ed in each district. The best pa­
per of the local group is then sub­
mitted to the national board, 
from which three papers are chos­
en, each receiving a stipend of 
a hundred dollars. Sinco the com­
petition was started two years 
ago, Tech lias won two out of 
three local prizes each year and 
one of the three national award« 
each year.

pleasure you get from a cigarette is in the smoke itself! 
That's plain common sense! But science can tell you—has 
pointed it out many times — that Camels are definitely 
slower-burning. That means a smoke free from the harsh, 
irritating qualities of excess heat—a smoke that is extra 
mild, extra cool, and extra flavorful.

Mrs. Rachel Boyd Long, a grad­
uate of the Costume Economics 
department in 1933, recently sub­
mitted a check for fifty dollars'to 
be used as a welcome addition to 
the Jane Fales Scholarship Fund 
for Costume Economics students.
The purpose of the fund is to 
establish in 1946 a permanent 
scholarship for girls interested in 
Costume Economics. All money 
is contributed to the fund through 
The Garden of Gold, an enter­
prise of the Carnegie Magazine. 
The Carnegie Foundation will 
double or treble whatever sum 
is accumulated by 1946. Thus, the 
actual value of Mrs. Long’s dona­
tion will be one hundred and fifty 
dollars at that time.

The Medical Brain Stumped,
By Tech’s Snap Hygiene Course
Everybody’s heard of Andre 
Szolce, yet few know of the sad­
dest experience of his life, con­
cerning his association with Hy­
giene or The Facts of Life in Book 
Form. Andre has been able to 
word oil beautiful women, trav­
el many miles for an edu­
cation, but still he is unable to 
pass the Hygiene course at Tech, 
though other students regard this 
course as a snap and the One 
Sure Thing.
Many slight discrepancies or 
contradictions to Andre's failure 
(not once, but twice) are found 
in his background. His grandfath­
er and father were both doctors, 
quite experienced and naturally 
thoroughly trained in their Held. 
Due to the fact that his father 
was head of a hospital in Hungary, 
.little Andre spent long hours 
watching operations through glass 
windows, the setting of broken 
limbs, and in general becoming 
thoroughly saturated with ether. 
In this he differed from the other 
young men of his age who satur­
ated themselves in alcohol.
In 1933 he became a member 
of the Red Cross, and tried val­
iantly to gain a medal for his val­
or, but was unsuccessful. How­
ever, he did learn a few more facts 
pbout Hygiene. Little did he know 
how useful they would be later. 
In 1934 he took two semesters of 
Hygiene at a school in Hungary 
and obtained . Excellent, which is 
better than A. Seeing our skep- 
iicism at this remark, Andre be­
gan a discourse on the value of 
Honesty but we nipped this in 
the bud.
Andre grew older and in 1939 
Fate led him .to our campus and 
enrolled him in the Hygiene class. 
Andre thought, “Ah, a snap!” as' 
so many rightly did before him, 
but he was to be sadly disillu­
sioned. Due to his inadequate 
.English, Prof. Risedorph required 
.special work from Andre which 
included outlines and definitions 
of the harder words. Andre spent 
lengthy hours on his Hygiene, ob­
tained three other texts, and 
watched others play tennis while 
he defined a femur or tibia in 
worthy style.
At the end of the semester he 
was rewarded with an F. Prof. 
Risedorph said, "I saw you failed 
other subjects, so I failed you.” 
Undaunted, Andre studied like 
mad for a reexam and obtained an 
11.
In 1940 Fate led Andre to the 
registration desk and again en­
rolled him in the Hygiene class. 
At mid-semester 'after more out­
lines and definitions .Andrew re­
ceived an F; at the end—an R. 
Poor Andre! Wearily he asked 
Prof. Risedorph, “Why must it 
be?” and the answer came back 
to him, “You missed it by one 
point!”
Andre decided to deal in ac­
tions, so he visited Dean Warden, 
Profs. Iiitchins, Keeble and Mr. 
Moses, Head of the Health De­
partment, trying to obtain* that 
credit for the course he took in 
Hungary. At present he is still 
waiting hopefully for their deci­
sion.
Sometime later we " talked to 
Andre, and asked him how he felt 
about the whole thing. “I still 
love Risedorph, but I hope to get 
credit so that I won’t bother him 
in class anymore,” said Andre. 
“I’ve decided to major in Hygiene; 
after all it’s an interesting sub­
ject—in fact I might go to Pitt 
night school.
“Hygiene has done me a lot of 
good. I’m healthy and so strong 
J. can hold up to 150 lbs. .on my 
lap for quite a while. I also have 
obtained quite a repertoire of 
,-jokes. There’s one that I didn’t 
catch on to though, and I hope 
to next time. Let me tell you—”
At this point we began to de­
part hastily, telling Andre that 
his experiences would be sure to 
help someone else when we print­
ed them.
“Print' them!" he muttered. 
“Please don’t do that!- I might 
flunk the course again!”
Needless to say we felt, it too 
wood to repress. Perhaps, tlje last 
chanter will read:
"In 1951 Fate led Andre to the 
Tech campus and enrolled him in 
the Hygiene class. Andre needs 
this one course to obtain a 
diploma from Tech. Let us hope 
that he passes this time. Amen.”

By Walter Stull
Abe Weiner, a special student 
in the department of Painting and 
Design, has received the Associ­
ated Artists’ first prize of $100 in 
their annual show, which opened 
last Friday. Weiner’s entry was 
a large oil landscape, called “Back 
of. Isaly’s.”
Although not regularly enrolled 
in the P&D department, Abe 
has been a student at Carnegie for 
some time. Up until this year, he 
took almost a full schedule with 
the class that are now seniors. 
This year, however,'he was un­
able to register in the day school 
and is a member of one of the 
Saturday advanced painting class­
es. ’

Proving that a man can enjoy 
his hobby despite a national de­
fense position and its resulting 
trips and meetings; and despite, 
the arduous task of running an 
institution of higher education,. 
Carnegie’s own President Doherty 
took an honorable, mention in the 
Associated Artists Exhibit which 
opened at the Fine Art Galleries 
last Thursday.
President Doherty’s piece was 
one of his steadily improving 
water colors. His present work far 
surpasses his attempts of a year 
ago.
The exhibition is the thirty- 
first annual show of the Associ­
ated Artists of Pittsburgh. On dis­
play is the best collection of oils, 
water colors, prints, sculpture, and 
crafts which the group has ever 
presented to the public; a really 
fine group which should prove in­
teresting to all who profess to

know about art, as well as to those 
who don’t.
Other . Carnegie personalities 
shared in the large group of priz­
es. Robert Gwathmey, who teach­
es in the Department of Painting 
and Design, took the Association’s 
third prize with his water color 
study of two negro figures, 
“Sharecroppers.” Two lone neg­
roes, simply drawn, point out' the 
moral of the theme, the soil upon 
which they stand is pebbly and 
barren, the gaunt figures of the 
man and • woman • carry out the 
feeling of inadequate sustenance. 
Gwathmey apparently does not 
let desire to point out a moral 
interfere with his artistic integ­
rity; his simple lines and choice 
of colors do as much to tell the 
tale as his choice of subjects.
Janet de Coux, a promising 
young woman who studied sculp­
ture at Carnegie for some time 
and then won a Guggenheim fel­
lowship, took the Society of 
Sculptor’s Prize for her natural 
colored portrait of a negro, “John 
Lindsay.” Janet de Croux is ex­
tremely versatile' in her model­
ing; usually epic in mood; mod­
ern but not abstract. In contrast 
to her superbly modeled prize 
winning head, she has a number 
of lyrical pieces in the exhibit.
Professor Clarence Carter of the 
Department of Painting and De­
sign proved somewhat startling to 
those who know his usual choice 
of subjects, by an unexpected dis- 
plny of interest in the blues and 
whites, of rigor-mortis, as evidenc- 
i'.i in his portrait study oi “Bill” 
hanging by the neck. He also took 
an honorable mention with his 
water color study. “By the 
Tracks,” a picture more within his 
usual scope of themes.
Professor Clayter’s wife, Fran­
cis MeComb Clay ter, repeated the 
family prize-winning perform­
ance with an excellent group of 
silver objects in modern style.
The exhibition is open to the 
public until March 13. As a trib­
ute io -it'', excellence, the Institute 
of Fine Arts will remain open in 
the evenings, as well as during 
the day. Hours are from ten a. 
m. to ten p. m. on week days, 
and from two p. m. to 6 p. m. on 
Sundays'. It is an exhibition that 
shouldn’t be missed.

By Mrs. Rose Lee 
The Chinese civilization has for. 
thousands of years preserved its 
culture by fostering the idea of 
raising its men. to be scholars— 
not soldiers. Even with the influx 
of modei’n education, the signifi­
cance of education is not lost. But 
it took an incident like the Sino- 
Japanese war to bring this ideol­
ogy to the fore—mainly because of 
the foresight of the leaders of 
China in visualizing the immense 
problems of reconstruction which 
confronts the youth of China.
Since most of the educational 
institutions are located along the 
seacoast, with the occupation of 
Peking, Tientsin, Canton, and oth­
er important cities, the effect of 
the migration. of the vast student 
body was tremendous. Millions of 
young people, both boys and girls, 
most of whom are separated from 
their families and without' ade­
quate means of support, have 
marched across 2000 miles of des­
ert to continue their work. Each 
of them is fired with the ambition 
of studying in the interest of lead- 
ing China in the future to a great
destiny. They are confident - with 
high hopes for their country!
The evacuation took the form 
of a long march from Changsha to 
Kunming, over ) period of three 
months—walking all .the. way un­
der constant hardships and not 
knowing .to, what type of .life they 
were going. In my personal con­
tact with the body of students 
who came through Canton City at 
this interval, it was one of the. in­
spirations of the war period to 
listen to these undaunted youths 
facing’ hardship with calm and 
fortitude. When one mentioned 
that by July they would reach 
their destination and then a va­
cation would be a fitting climax, 
to their three , months of walking, 
the answers, were a bit indignant 
and impatient. “We will not take 
any summer vacations while our 
country needs us for this task of 
reconstruction. There is work to 
be done among the villagers—-we 
must work with our people . . .”
When they arrived in Kun­
ming, the students did not go to 
modern schoolrooms with steam 
heat, concrete buildings, and mod­
ern laboratories. In some cases 
one book must serve two hun­
dred students! There is a great 
sharing of mutual hardships; at 
one school the teachers were re­
ported to be giving up one of 
their meals'so that their students 
could have one! It is said that
meat is so rare in the diet of the 
students that a piece of meat can 
only be seen through a micro­
scope. Millet comprises most of 
their -food, but this meagre diet 
has -not deterred the students’ - aV- 
dor for their. school work. It is 
also significant that the enroll­
ment of. the students has increas­
ed in these mud-housed .Universi­
ties.
One can scarcely minimize the 
significance of this great move 
in China as being a mere war- 
emergency measure; there is a 
decided feeling of permanency in 
the migration. It is predicted that, 
the hinterland will become the 
cradle of learning in China, that 
the institutions which have taken 
root now will not perish but will 
carry on their valuable work of 
training leaders for China’s re^- 
construction.
The drive which is going on 
through America to aid Chinese 
students in their hour of need is 
indeed a symbol of American 
friendship for China, which has 
been extended in the past. It is 
fitting that the drive which is go­
ing on now should include the 
Chinese students in its benefits. 
The thanks that comes to Am­
erica from China is one which 
cannot be adequately expressed 
in words—rather *it is Oriental 
expression which takes the form 
of silent gratitude.
CwenTs Tag Day 
Is Huge Success
The Cwen’s fourth annual 
scholarship fund tag day was un­
usually successful. The sale of 
carnations on the campus last 
week increased their accumula­
tive fund for a future scholarship 
by thirty dollars, five dollars over 
the annual quota.
Each year the Cwens hold a 
tag day for their scholarship ac­
count. As yet the plan is in its in­
fancy, and no award has been 
made; but when the fund has 
grown to useful proportions, it 
is planned to make a periodical 
award to some worthy student in 
Margaret Morrison or Fine Arts.
“Dancers Eii Route”
On Wednesday afternoon, March 
5,: at 3:30 p. m. and Thursday 
evening, March 6, at 8:15 p. m. 
in Thistle Hall, the Dance Club 
will sponsor an exhibition of mod­
ern dance technique by four dis­
tinguished “Dancers en Route.”
The dancers, Elizabeth Waters, 
Sam Steen, Linda Loch, and Ray 
Harrison will present in costume 
a series of interpretations, some 
of which Will be serious and some 
humorous. Admission for Tech 
students will be 50c, but reserved 
tickets may be obtained for $1.00. 
Elizabeth Waters will instruct the 
dance classes free of charge while 
she is here; She and other mem­
bers of the troupe are touring the 
country: this is the first time that 
they will appear together at Tech.

Student Nurses at Columbia 
Hospital in Wilkinsburg will re­
ceive members of the Men’s Glee 
Club tomorrow evening at a con­
cert and dance to be given at the

Student Predicts Tyrants’
Downfall in Unique Plaything
up the toy, sees Hitler staring him 
in the face, turns the bomb around 
expecting to see the same face on 
the other side, and is startled to 
see a face of Stalin. It is at this 
point that the “two-faced” nature 
of the toy is brought home to the 
observer.
Upon looking at the bomb one 
is struck by its resemblance to 
“Humpty Dumpty” of Mother 
Goose fame.. You will recall that 
Humpty was sitting on top of 
the world until he fell off the 
wall—and .“all the kind’s horses 
and all the kings men couldn’t 
put him together again.” It would 
seem that Hitler and his cohoi-t 
are in much the same position as 
Humpty was; and if they are not 
careful nothing will be able to 
save them.
It is also significant that these 
men should be pictured together 
on a weapon of destruction, when 
they recently joined hands to de­
stroy the world. Yes, real bombs 
represent death and destruction, 
but toy bombs can do the same 
thing in a much subtler way.

Bombs—to most people, in this 
time of war and strife, bombs sig­
nify death and destruction. But 
not to Charles Spry, of Tech, ap­
parently.
Recently, in the Painting and 
Design Department where Chuck 
is a senior, the students were re­
quired to fashion toys by turn­
ing samples of wood. Chuck de­
cided to make an intellectual 
plaything for his project. So, after 
many hours of tedious work the 
figment of. his imagination came 
into being.
This modern toy is in the form 
of a bomb (of the type usually 
dropped from planes) with a car­
icature of Hitler on one side and 
one of Stalin on the other. It 
seems significant that it is a 
“two-faced” toy—this being a 
characteristic of both of the men 
caricatured. The observer picks

STILL LOSING

AQUATIC LUMINARIES
Word has just come from our 
outpost that the Tartan basket­
ball team has returned home from 
their, eastern jaunt. Our frontier 
guardsman also informs us that 
our standard bearers kept the 
slate clean, that is, failed to win 
their eleventh, twelfth or 
thirteenth contests. The last bit of 
information passed on to us by our 
guardian of the boundry is that 
for the first time in their career, 
as a ball club, they played as a 
class A team only to be defeated 
by tough breaks, and poor officiat­
ing. To substantiate this informa­
tion our informer used the Vil- 
linova contest as an example. At 
the half time during this contest' 
our charges were out in front 
due to sensational shooting and. 
well executed team play. How­
ever, during the second half of 
the battle, the officials caught up 
with them and set the squad down 
for their thirteenth consecutive 
loss.
The high light of the trip was 
the brilliant playing of old Tippy 
Toes (Red Burch to the unknow­
ing) who for the first time this 
season played in the superb style 
of which he is capable. Maxie 
himself put the tag on Red Ran­
dall when he said, “With a couple 
more ball players possessing Red 
Burch’s ability we would be win­
ning rather than losing all our 
ball games.”
Tartan Skaters Start Swishing:
One of the little-heard-from 
Tartan aggregations is the Skibo 
ice t hockey team. This organiza­
tion has already appeared in three 
contests, winning two and drop­
ping the other engagement.
Mermen Still Even
Sporting the .best aggregation 
ever to don the skater’s pads for 
the Plaid icers the, organization 
(due to several unusual twists of 
fate) has been unable to book 
many games with other college 
squads. However, due to the ef­
forts of Captain Fred Feiler and 
Coach Bob Simpson, a local league 
of city amateur teams and Car­
negie Tech is in the formation 
stage. This local league would add 
color to the preliminary games 
staged before the International 
League hockey matches played in 
Duquesne Gardens.
The skaters’ next contest is 
scheduled for this Friday on the 
ice in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 
The Skibo’s opponents on this oc­
casion will be the skaters from 
Penn State. If you can’t make the 
trip to Johnstown you can shoot 
a word of encouragement to sev­
eral of our local skaters; some­
one once said, “Every little bit 
helps,” who can tell, you might 
:be the one causing a-much need­
ed Tartan victory.
Swimmers Keep Swimming-
To date the record of Coach Al­
len E. Risedorph’s swimmers 
stands at two wins and two loss­
es. Victors over Kent State and 
Western Reserve, the aquatic per­
formers were sunk by the mer­
men of Penn State and Slippery 
Rock. In each meet Captain Bill 
Molvie, Ted Burtis, Bob Boehmig, 
and Frank Martin have taken a 
big share of the total points, 
however, the lack of swimming 
talent capable of taking the all 
impox*tant second and third plac­
es has spelled defeat for the home 
force on more than one occasion.

On Saturday, our swimming 
team took a trip to Slippery Rock 
and received their second defeat 
of the season. The team lost this 
meet by a score of- 42 to 33, al­
though the boys showed a great 
deal of spirit all through the con­
test.
In the 300 yard medley Church, 
Cully’and Carver gave up the in­
itial five points to the Slippex-y 
Rock squad. Boehmig won the 220 
fx-ee style in a close race, but 
the Slippei-y Rock team took both 
second and third places so that 
Tech only received five points for 
this event, while Slippery Rock 
picked up four. Tech’s Molvie took 
first place in this event, but again 
the rest of the Skibo team failed 
to back up the winner and the 
Rockets took four moi’e points 
on this defeat. Brown, the Tar­
tan’s fancy diver, won his event, 
and Px-itchard of Slippex’y Rock 
took second, netting Tech five 
points and four for the opponents. 
^Vlolvie came in second in the 100 
yard free style while Slippery 
Rock took both fix-st and third 
places giving Slippery Rock six 
and Tech thx*ee. In the 150 yaxd 
backstroke, Martin took second 
and Tech received four points to 
the Rockets five. Loper, Tech’s

with the I'emaining eight going 
to the opponents. Boehmig came 
from behind to win the 440 free­
style, giving our squad five point«. 
Tech won the 400 yard relay, and 
thus Tech took the final seven 
points.
However, Satuxday’s meet 
against Westex-n Reserve Uni- 
vei’sity told an entirely different 
stoxy, with Tech winning by a 
score of 43 to 32.
Tech won the 300 medley relay 
with Max’tin, Vajda and Carver 
swimming. Boehmig, as yet un­
beaten in the 440 yaxd freestyle, 
won both the 220 freestyle and 
the 440 freestyle. Molvie won the 
50 yaxd freestyle, and Brown fol­
lowed with a win over Western 
Reserve in the fancy diving event. 
Molvie again came thx-ough by 
beating Western , Reserve in the 
100 yaxd fx-eestyle. Martin took 
the 150 yaxd backstroke from Nor- 
wald of Western Reserve. Tech 
dropped both the 220 yard breast 
stroke and the 400 yaxd relay 
to its opponents. This evens up 
Tech’s record with two wins and 
as many losses. With any luck the 
team should do very well the rest

turned in especially fine perform­
ances. Captain Red Burch paced 
the scox’ing for the Plaid in the 
Penn State and Villanova games, 
while Herm Hennessey showed the 
way in the Franklin & Marshall 
fx-acas with 13 counters.
Penn State was just too much 
for the Tartans, and the men from 
Mt. Nittany had things pretty , 
much their own way until the final ’ 
whistle blew. Burch’s 11 points 
was one of the few consoling fixc- 
tox’s in the defeat.
Tartans Go Wild At Villanov 
In the Villanova gym the Sld- 
bos absorbed their most heart- 
bx-eaking loss of the year. Tear­
ing into the Wildcats like national 
champs in the first half, the Tar­
tan offense paced by Niederbex-ger 
and Iiolets piled up an amazing 
28-9 lead as the period closed. The 
Scots played the kind of ball that 
local x’ootex*s have been hoping 
they would play all season as they 
ran rings around the Villanova 
quintet and dropped in shots from 
all angles.
Had not the Skibos had the bad 
break of seeing Holets and Ker- 
mit Patton go out on fouls soon 
after the second half opened, they 
might have gone on to register 
their fix'st victory of the year at 
the expense of the highly touted 
Wildcat five But the home guaxds 
were out for blood in the last pe­
riod and rapidly closed the gap in 
the score to take a 40-36 triumph.
However, if the Tartan floor- 
men can regain the stride they hit 
in the beginning of this game, the 
fading 1940-41 season may yet see
come together on the field, on the 
gym floor, on the bowling alley, 
and here they can mingle and ac­
tually become acquainted. So stop 
complaining that you don’t have 
a chance to meet gals from the 
other school and appear where 
they are. You can’t afford to miss 
the chance.
Well, there are hundreds of rea­
sons why we think you are miss­
ing things by not entering into 
the activities of the W. A. A., but 
it isn’t wox'th while to merely en- 
umei-ate them. I’m just trying to 
convince some of you of some­
thing . that many, many know is 
true. In our dx-ive to advertise the 
possibilities of W. A. A., we may 
sound desperate for enthusiasts, 
when that isn’t the case at all. 
We have a strong body of W. A. 
A.-ers who suppox’t the activities 
all the time, but we are sorry .that 
.everyone does not come out for 
sports when they are designed for 
.the benefit of every girl on camp­
us!

At the present moment Intra­
mural sports arc In the middle of 
their respective schedules, and it 
as becoming possible to do a lit­
tle predicting as to the winners of 
some of the leagues. At least sev­
eral groups have narrowed the 
competition down to several teams 
who will probably keep their 
px'esent status and battle through 
for fix-st place honox's. Such a sit­
uation has arisen in both the In­
dependent and Interfratei-nity 
leagues in basketball competition. 
At the present reading there are 
exactly three undefeated teams 
in the Independent group. Leading 
on the basis of the greatest num­
ber of games played, and thex'e-
some entries in the victory column 
for Tech basketball.
F & M Game Disappointing:
Based on their pex'fox’mance 
against the Wildcats, the experts 
conceded the Plaid a good chance 
to take over a Franklin & Mar­
shall squad with a non-too-good 
x-ecord last Friday night. But the 
game only proved to be loss num­
ber 13 for the visitors as it ap­
peared that they had shot their 
wad on Philadephia’s Main Line 
in the Villanova gym.
Tech hung pretty, close to the 
Diplomats during the first three 
neriods. but a total collapse in the 
final chukker gave F & M a com­
manding 56-43 triumph.

With the golf season just around 
the corner Mr. Overend is asking 
that all golfers who plan to try 
out for the team do so soon. No 
definite arrangements can be made 
until the names are in.
Arrangements have been made 
for pi’actice in the gym, since no 
coui’ses have been found for the 
best set up as far as practice is 
concerned. The Schenley coux*se 
would be ideal except for the fact 
that it does not open until the sea­
son is almost closed for Tech golf- 
ers. It has been suggested that 
those men who do not have classes 
in the morning may be able to 
practice at that time both- in the 
gym and cn the course that is 
finally picked.
The outlook for the coming sea­
son is very good. The whole first 
team from la'st year will be on 
hand to carry on in a much 
smoother fashion than last year 
because the hooks and slices 
have been ironed out. In addi­
tion to Jack Ellen, John Shymoski, 
George Tondorf, Harry Sacks, and 
A1 Gubey the freshman team will 
px-ovide material for the vai’sity, 
and accoxding to Mr. Overend, 
very good material. Relative to 
all reports, the Tartans should 
have one of the best links squads 
to represent the Plaid in sevei’al 
years.
Tartan Skaters 
Crush Greensburg; 
Play State Friday
Cax-negie Tech’s fighting icers 
hung up another victox'y in 
Greensburg last Monday at the 
expense of the Greensburg Am­
ateur team, completely outplaying 
,the home guards to the tune of 
6-1.
“Flash” Evans, who was the 
leading scorer of the fracas, open­
ed the attack for the Tartans with 
a tally eai'ly in the first period, 
but Greensburg’s man, Smith, 
soon knotted the count. In the 
second period the Techmcn really 
.turned on the heat, and were 
never headed for the remainder 
of the game. Featured In the Ski­
bo offense were three goals by 
Evans, two by Ivan Sivachek, and 
one to the credit of Benny Berg­
son.
This Friday night the fast-skat­
ing Tartans invade Johnstown to 
take on the Nittany Lions ol! Penn 
State. The game is slated to start 
at eight o’clock, and will be held 
at the Schaeffer Ice Palace. There 
is nothing like a big rooting sec­
tion to spur the team on to vic­
tory, so let’s go out to the game 
this Friday and help the Plaid 
win. If State can do it, so can wel
fore on a percentage basis, is the 
strong Citcom Clan club. Next in 
line arc, respectively, the Scobel- 
iites and the Metallurgists.
The Interfraternity League rat­
ing is similar. Having been un­
defeated up to date, the S. A. E.’s 
are leading the league by a slim 
margin! There are two other teams 
in the competition that have suf­
fered only one defeat, and they 
still have an excellent chance of 
winning. I am referring to the 
D. U.’s and Kappa Sig’s. Strange­
ly enough, the Kappa Sig’s were 
defeated only by the D. U.’s and 
the D. U.’s only by the S. A. E.’s. 
The S. A. E.’s and Kappa Sig’s 
have not met in competition as 
yet. Draw your own conclusions.
Along the Intramural line, here 
is a MUST for all those interested 
in boxing and wrestling. Wednes­
day (tomorrow) will absolutely be 
the last day for those planning 
to enter the boxing competition 
without being disqualified for the 
tournament. For wrestling, 
Thux-sday (the day after tomor­
row) will be the final entry date.
As one basketball aspirant said 
recently, “Volleyball is coming in­
to its own on the Tech campus and 
the intex-est shown should be well 
appreciated,” Such is the situa­
tion, for this new-to-Tech sport 
has taken a firm hold on the stu­
dents and is growing rapidly.

“Buzz” Aston and His Orchestra 
Scheduled for Traditional Events 
In Thistle Hall Saturday, Feb. 22
The Evening Student Council 
will 'celebrate Washington’s Birth­
day with a dance in Thistle Hall 
on Saturday Evening, Feb. 22. The 
Washington Birthday Dance is the 
second oldest dance on the Even­
ing School Campus and was first 
held during the school year of 
1923-24.
Social Chairman- Joe Gummo 
has been fortunate in securing the 
sweet swing of “Buzz Aston” and 
his orchestra. “Buzz Aston’s” Or­
chestra consists of eleven men 
and a girl vocalist. The band has 
made a wonderful record at the 
Schenley Hotel and was chosen 
from among eleven other local 
bands to play the 1940 New Years 
Eve Ball at the William Penn 
Hotel. This will be the first ap­
pearance of this orchestra on the 
night school campus and the 
music should be at its best.
Thistle Hall will be decorated 
in a typical Washington Birthday 
theme with hatchets and cherries 
predominating. The hall will be 
filled with multi-colored lights 
and the spotted reflections from 
our ever-present revolving crys­
tal ball.
Dancing will start promptly at 
nine and culminate at midnight. 
Lovely corsages will be present­
ed to the first 200 fair damsels 
so get your favorite to be ready 
early in order that she may re­
ceive hers.
The following members of the 
Faculty have been invited to 
chaperon the dance: Mr. and Mrs. 
II. L. McKee, Mr. and Mrs. Dal- 
ziel M'cKelway, Dr. and Mrs. 
Beryl, E. Warden, Mr. and Mrs. 
Kent Shaffer, Professor and Mrs. 
Wlllbald Trinlcs, President and 
Mrs. Robert E. lDoherty and Mr. 
Peter Alemano.
Social Chairman .Toe Gum­
mo and his assistant, Lou R. Fos- 
ner, will have charge of the dance 
and they wish that all Evening 
Student Council Activity Award 
workers who can make signs will 
make as many as possible and 
turn them in to any council mem­
ber as soon as they can.

Everyday wo read in the pa­
pers about someone Invading 
something, and now it has hap­
pened—The Tech Campus has 
been invaded. By whom? Well, 
by a couple of would-be “Big 
Shots” who are trying to pull the 
old parking game. It seems that 
these boys have been stopping 
cars near Skibo Inn, and dierct- 
ing them to the parking lot along 
Margaret Morrison Street. That 
service in itself would be fine, 
but the boys don’t work without 
pay, no sir, they’re asking 35c 
and 50c as payment for their du­
ties.
According to the administration 
no one has been authorized to col­
lect any parking fees on school 
property. If the “boys” try to pull 
you in please report them to a

We hope you were at the In­
dustries Valentine Dance because 
if you weren’t you missed some­
thing right special. Besides hearts 
and flowers and streamers and 
such like, there was an orchestra 
with such renditions that Toscan­
ini even would quiver with envy. 
Besides, all the people of note 
were there. We were 'there. A 
great many other people were, too, 
in fact almost too many. It was 
almost too cozy, almost a bit too 
intimate, in fact it was a mob. 
Seems a pity somebody didn’t stay 
home and study. We have no com­
plaints. It was just wonderful ex­
cept for the sand and ashes that 
someone scattered around the 
floor. This was remedied during 
intermission, but before that, no 
one smiled, they were all too 
busy gritting their teeth.
It was a quiet, refined crowd 
until Ronny Schoff walked across 
the floor, when every blond was 
galvanized into action. He should 
stay in dark corners, or shave his 
head or blacken his teeth or some­
thing. 1-Ie inherited all those 
iblonds from Bob (I-don’t-like- 
blonds-I-j us t-l i ke-Marian Dickin­
son and Jim Bluebeard) Miller.
And in line with brunettes, 
/Thelma, Ye Ed’s gal, was thex-e 
.with, of all people, Ye Ed. We 
.think it would be nice if just for 
news, Thelma would go to a 
•couple of dances with Herman, 
,better known as Schnitzie and Ye 
/Ed would go with the three An­
derson sisters loaned by RICO..
We want to remind you of the 
Washington Birthday dance on 
the 22nd, one of those swank, 
|jouncil affairs. We know you can 
come if you try. Don’t just cry 
¿yourself to sleep at night. Write 
a letter to Garbo or wire your 
congressman. Do something, but 
£ome. You’ll just hate yourself if 
you don’t.
school olllce at once. By the way, 
we don’t think anyone will find 
it necessary to pay to park for a 
dance. There is plenty of free 
parking on school property away 
from the “boys.”
Cooperation
Student Council is to be con­
gratulated for the splendid step 
they' have taken toward better 
day and evening school relations. 
The P. A. System which the two 
groups jointly purchased will add 
much to the success of future 
campus affairs. The advantage of 
the system will be especially no­
ticeable at the dances held in the 
gym. So hats off to day and even­
ing student councils.
More National Defense
This National Defense Program 
is causing everyone trouble, es­
pecially those students who drive 
to school, and must find a place 
to park their cars. In this Na­
tional emergency, however, we all 
must make some concessions and 
nite students can do their bit by 
cooperating with the officers of the 
school. If we all park our cars 
as close together as we possibly 
can, and make use of the special 
parking stickers which have been 
issued by the administration I 
think we can get by. So let’s all 
put our shoulders to the wheel and 
do our bit.
Lest We Forget
February is the month of presi­
dents. This month we celebrate 
the birthdays of the two men who 
are largely responsible for the 
strength of our nation today. As 
we celebrate their birthday.4} let’s 
promise to keep the nation they 
fostered a free nation of free peo­
ple.

March 1 Is Date 
Set for Dance 
In Thistle Hall
Of course Engineers can dance. 
Just because they carry slide 
rules, characteristic of the spe­
cies. and large brief-cases, they 
can still “cut a mean rug.” Every­
one on the campus will have an 
opportunity to see it when they 
hold their last dance of the season 
in Thistle Hall on March 1st. Of 
course you may all attend, and to 
show that the Engineers are so­
ciable, you can dance as well. And 
you will dance well, to the 
music of Art Sable and his or­
chestra. He has eleven musically- 
minded and talented men in his 
band, and they are sure they can 
provide the music you want. Of 
course you’ve heard them. They 
played for the Sigma Alpha Fra­
ternity dance in the Fall.
There will be, as usual, two 
hundred lucky couples who will 
receive lovely corsages and clev­
er programs, if they are fortun­
ate enough to be there early. The 
dancing will begin at 9:00 P. M., 
but why not come earlier and re­
new acquaintances and enjoy the 
novel decorations?
Officers in charge of the affair 
are D. W. Pettigrew, Jr., presi­
dent; F. Amuso, vice president; 
Ed Nuss, treasurer, and J. C. Gore, 
secretary.

Dr. Robert G. Simpson of the 
Department of Psychology and 
Education, is again offering his 
services to the night school stu­
dents in Remedial Reading. For 
the last few years Dr. Simpson 
has been aiding the day students 
in their studying through 'l(his 
service. Any students needing his 
help should go to his office and 
laboratory, Industries 253B, on 
February 21st, between 6:30 and 
8:30. At this time the night will 
be chosen which will satisfy most 
persons.
Last semester this service was 
offered for the first time to the 
evening school as an experiment. 
Students have proven Remedial 
Reading very helpful by improve­
ment of grades. Dr. Simpson will 
take each person individually. He 
will discuss his problem and set 
up a course of study to overcome 
the difficulties. Any student 
needing help in studying, grasping 
the meaning in their reading, find­
ing the point in a problem, will 
find this assistance very valuable.
If sufficient interest is shown, 
two evenings may be devoted to 
this subject. If you wish to re­
ceive this service but are unable 
to attend Friday evening, let 
Dr. Simpson know of your inter­
est and arrangements will be made 
for a consultation period. Evening 
students should take advantage of 
this service.
Calendar Change
Date for the Annual Banquet 
pf the Evening College of En­
gineers, originally scheduled for 
April 26, has been changed to May 
3, because of the fact that it was 
impossible to obtain reservations 
in a hotel large enough to accom­
modate the group, on that date.
This is one of the oldest tradi­
tions on the Tech Evening School 
Campus, and is always a huge success.
Don’t fox-get the date—May 3rd 
—and the place—Hotel Schenley. 
Leave your date at home, and get 
pet for a real stag affair with all 
the trimmin’s. A good time is 
guaranteed.

Prominent Student 
Holds Dual Offices 
On Student Council
The members of the Evening 
Student Council have chosen Lou ^ 
R. Fosner as the assistant social 
chaix-man for their activities. 
After serving this year as assist­
ant, Lou will become social chair­
man for the next year.
Lou has also been elected as the 
Secx-etax-y of the Evening College 
of Fine Arts for the cux-rent year. 
Last year he sex-ved on council as 
the Treasurer of Fine Arts. Pre­
vious to that he had been on their 
Social Committee for two yeax-s.
. Lou received his elementax-y 
schooling at Schenley High 
School, where he majored in the 
academic coux-se. In high school 
he was a member of the basket­
ball and football squads. His foot­
ball career was cut short by a 
shoulder injury, but he contin­
ued with his basketball and latex- 
played semi-pro ball for Akx*on.
Entering Cai’negie in the fall 
of 1936, he started the long trek 
toward a degree in Architecture. 
Lou will receive his Certificate in 
Architecture this June.
Lou is the proud bearer of three 
activity awards and will x’eceive 
his fourth award this year. For his 
work in activities, he was called to 
the JNfu Sigma Alpha Activities 
I-Ionorax-y Fraternity in 1938.
Most of Lou’s time is spent here 
at school working in the architec- 
tural dx'afting rooms and the bal­
ance working lor «the Grand Rap­
ids Construction Company, where 
he utilizes his architectural train­
ing.
Lou can be seen at almost every 
period of our school dances, but 
like most of the Art School Of­
ficers usually attends the dances 
alone. He is partial to sweet music 
and doesn’t care much for jitter- 
bugging. You seldom hear him 
mention anything about women, 
but he gets around.
Students Ho
Earn Your Needed 
Insignia Points Now
Workers! Workers! Workers! 
Where are the workers? Social 
affairs don’t take care of them­
selves you know. They need will­
ing hands for the dozens of odd 
jobs to be done before, during, and 
after they take place.
Thex-e is help needed particu- 
lax-ly for the dance coming up on 
the 22nd. This is a Council dance, 
and instead of eax-ning only two 
points at each working pex-iod, it 
is possible to obtain thx-ee, making 
possible nine points in all for the 
three working periods—Satux-day 
afternoon, 1:00 to 5:00,- Saturday 
night during the dance from 9:00 
to 12‘00, and Sunday aftex-noon 
fx*oih 1:00 to 5:00, which is the 
general clean-«p period.
We do need your help—the 
worst kind of a way. Sp won’t 
you come out and lend a hand? 
You’ll have as much fun as work 
. . . and the Insignia award IS 
worth working for.
Old “Skilio” 
Aimed High 
In Year 1927
Aside from the scholastic value 
of the night school, there is one 
other outstanding angle which to 
the casual observer might seem 
trivial.
This advantage might be term­
ed “Night school friendships and 
their uses.”
Irx the course of your work, 
there are times when informa­
tion on a subject in which you 
have had no experience, is want­
ed. Here is where your night 
school friends are an asset. In your 
organization, you will become 
known as a source of infox-ma- 
tion. Beyond all doubt, this will 
aid your own development and 
advancement.
Look about you when on the 
campus, cultivate fx-iends and ac­
quaint yourself with their activi­
ties. You will find that some of 
these friendships will be close and 
endux-ing, and your night classes 
will be mox-e interesting when 
good fellowship is present.
If you ax-e to get the maximum 
advantage of the night school, the 
cultivation of fx*iends on the 
campus is essential. The night 
students can go a long way to- 
wax-d overcoming the so-called 
disadvantage of the lack of school 
spirit.
There has been a surprising 
growth of night school activities 
in the last two yeax-s, and we be­
lieve it will go a long way to­
ward eliminating the mortality of 
students along the way.
The night student council can 
not be px-aised too highly for its 
work, and is worthy of your sup- 
port in all its undertakings._______

Registtration Cards 
Needed To Obtain 
Parking Permits
Those of you who weren’t for­
tunate enough to get in on the 
first lot of “Special Parking” 
stickers will be glad to learn 
that a new supply has been print­
ed, and are now available at the 
Registrar’s Office in the Admin- 
istx*ation Building. These are for 
the use of the regularly scheduled 
Evening School students ONLY 
and NOT for those of the Nation­
al Defense group. To obtain a 
sticker, it is absolutely necessary 
to present your registration card.
The sticker should be placed 
on the left rear side window of 
your car where it can readily be 
seen by the parking guard or at­
tendant, and the student should 
offer his cooperation by appx-oach- 
ing the dx-ive slowly, and paus­
ing long enough for the attendant 
to check his car -for the sticker. 
The pax-king lots reserved for this 
purpose are those located back 
of Engineex-ing Hall and Machin- 
ex-y Hall.
The Registrar’s Office is open 
evex-y evening from Monday 
through Fx-iday, 7:00 to 9:30. The 
tickets ax-e limited, one to a stu­
dent, and while there may be a 
good supply at the px-esent time, 
remember they won’t last for­
ever. So get yours at the earliest 
opportunity.________________________
