Senior computer science major Drew 
T. Ross, 21, a native of Lexington, MA, 
died October 21 of an apparent suicide. 
His body was discovered last Friday 
morning.
Ross was chair of Activities Board 
Concerts, a brother in Delta Tau Delta, 
and a design minor. “He was easy to get 
along with, always friendly, outwardly 
happy, independent, and funny.
“He lightened up our meetings,* said 
Martin Dixon, Activities Board chair 
and junior electrical and computer engi­
neering major. Howard Meisner, Activi­
ties Board Tech chair, said Ross’ accom­
plishments with Activities Board Con­
certs were impressive. “He brought Belly 
and John Wesley Harding, which were 
two of the best shows I’ve ever done here.
Even if something didn’t go his way, 
he didn’t get upset about it — it was 
another thing to chalk up to experience,” 
he said. “Everyone will miss him in their 
own way.
“ I’ll miss him for being a cheery face in 
the office. I’ll miss him for simply being 
Drew.”
“He was a wonderful son and a great
brother to his sister Amanda. He was 
very talented and creative and we will 
miss him,” said his mother, Nancy Ross.
Tonya Rado, a close friend and a se­
nior professional writing major, said, 
“We both spent a lot of time together — 
we both worked at Activities Board and 
at EDRC.
“No matter what he was doing, he 
would drop everything to talk to you. He 
looked out for people and was always 
there for me,” she said.
Ross was also a freshman orientation 
counselor. “He always had a smile and 
would do anything for you.
“He was a good friend and the fresh­
man orientation program benefited from 
him.
“He had a high energy level and was 
one of the greatest guys I know,” said 
Marcia Frank, a head freshman orienta­
tion counselor and a senior psychology 
major.
“He was friends to many people on 
campus. He’d always make time for 
people and drop what he was doing. We 
all loved him,” said Alex Scharf, Ross’ 
housemate and a senior electrical and 
computer engineering major.
“It is obviously a very sad and difficult 
thing to deal with,” said Michael Murphy,
dean of student affairs. “We have per­
sonally contacted those individuals 
whom we know were closest to him and 
provided what we can during this diffi­
cult time.”
“I urge members of the campus com­
munity to seek support from friends or 
from the counseling center which is open 
24 hours.
“I know people will deal with this in 
their own way, but I want people to 
know there are resources available for 
them,” he said.
Additional details about the circum­
stances of Ross’ death remain unavail­
able until the coroner’s report is re­
leased later this week.
A memorial service is scheduled to be 
held Thursday afternoon, with an exact 
time and place to be announced today on 
the electronic bboard e,,tutldMay-hoan bM 
For information, call Student Affairs at 
268-2075 or the Counseling Center at

He is survived by his sister, Amanda 
Ross, 15, and his mother, Nancy Ross.

Cluster undergoes maintenance
By BILL VANDERMARK
ilsrlo mrl,,nstras
On Thursday, October 20, stu­
dents felt the computer crunch 
even more than usual. Eleven of 
the 42 machines in the Hunt 
Apple Orchard were shut down 
for cleaning from 3 to 6 pm.
This type of cleaning is known 
as preventive maintenance. This 
task, which was usually com­
pleted over the summer months, 
has now been instituted to take 
place year round. The reason for 
this is to increase the longevity of 
the machines.
In using preventive mainte­
nance, the inside of the computer 
is cleaned so that it will work as 
efficiently as it can. Even though 
this job used to only take place 
during the summer, the techni­
cians were finding that the com­
puters were filthy on the inside.
This isn’t healthy for the ma­
chine and causes wear and tear 
on the interior.
“The machines on campus get 
an awful lot of usage.” said 
Pomona Valero, the Cluster Ser­
vices Manager. “We used to only 
shut them down during the sum­
mer, but then we would have to 
shut down the entire cluster for 
an extended period. By using pre­
ventive maintenance earlier, we 
manage to shave off the down 
time for each computer.”
This works out well in the end 
for the students. Not only does 
the maintenance keep the com­
puters clean and efficient, it also 
extends the life of the machines 
greatly.
This means the computers will 
be around longer and will work 
better for students.
Some students, however, don’t 
see it as a long-term solution. “I
can’t believe that they take time 
out of our schedules to run main­
tenance checks on the comput­
ers. Why can’t they do that s4>vrt of 
thing when the cluster is closed?” 
said an anonymous student look­
ing for a computer during the 
maintenance shut-down.
The student’s friend agreed. 
“It’s hard enough to find a com­
puter on this campus without 
Computing Services yanking a 
bunch of them out of use.”
Even though some students 
disagree, there are those that are 
in favor of what Computing Ser­
vices is doing.
“I’m glad they are finally tak­
ing care of the machines. That 
means we won’t have to pay for 
new ones out of next year’s tu­
ition.”
The maintenance in the cluster 
will be completed by the time of 
publication.

Presidential food committee established
By MAX CHITTISTER
ilsrlo mrl,,nstras
In order to give students, staff, and 
faculty a greater voice in on-campus 
dining, student body president Declan 
McCullagh has organized a Presidential 
Committee on Dining.
“Right now, there’s not a good way for 
people on campus to provide input to 
Dining Services. Now that Skibo’s gone, 
we really need better food — especially 
in Morewood Gardens — and this will 
help tell Dining Services ex­
actly what we need,” said 
McCullagh.
The first meeting of the 
committee is tentatively 
scheduled for Wednesday,
October 26. The committee 
will eventually consist of rep­
resentatives of Student Sen­
ate, Faculty Senate, GSO,
SDC, Staff Council, and__________
Greek Council.
However, representatives 
of Staff Council and Greek Council have 
yet to be named. The first meeting will 
happen “with or without [the represen­
tatives!,” McCullagh said. Also, the chair 
of the committee has yet to be selected.
The Presidential Committee on Din­
ing is intended to be an advisory com­
mittee to Dining Services. According to 
McCullagh, “the main purpose is to give 
Dining Services input on how the uni­
versity as a whole feels about food on 
campus.”
In addition to the undergraduate stu­
dents living on campus, it has been esti­
mated that there are 3,000 staff mem­
bers and 1,000 faculty members who eat 
on campus.
The Presidential Committee on Din­
ing will give them the chance for “their 
voices to be heard,” said McCullagh. He 
feels that lack of communication is the 
main problem in the Building D food 
cart move. The undergraduate students
“The committee can do some really 
great things. ”
Declan McCullagh, Student 
Body President
want the carts to stay, but faculty and 
graduate students want the carts to 
move, and there is nowhere for the two 
groups to talk. That is what the new 
committee will provide. A formal agenda 
has not yet been set.
One of the subjects for discussion is 
the possibility of having lunch carts in 
the Baker/Porter complex. It is under 
consideration to place the carts inside
the entrance from Flagstaff Hill, next to 
the bicycle racks.
ScotlandYardis another subject which 
could be discussed, although there is a 
separate task force dealing with the 
Yard.
Right now, the new plan is to place 
the Yard in the Faculty Dining Room 
instead of the Morewood Cafeteria. The 
main problem is how to accommodate 
smokers and nonsmokers.
Smoking in the cafeteria would inter­
fere with daily food service, so in order to 
accommodate everyone, 
the Yard would be placed 
in the Faculty Dining 
Room, and an air filter­
ing system would be set 
up.
The Building D move is 
another possible item on 
the agenda. It has been 
indicated that the move
_____________ might be postponed until
as late as winter break. 
Finally, there could be 
some discussion of moving new dining 
sites onto campus.
This is only in the discussion stage, as 
of now. One possibility is a Pizza Hut or 
similar establishment on campus.
The meetings will be open to the pub­
lic, and meeting times will be publicly 
posted. According to McCullagh, “[The 
committee] can do some really great 
things.”

THIS JUST IN...
US lowers number of troops in the Gulf
WASHINGTON, October 21 
(D J)—The U.S. is sharply scal­
ing back the size of the military 
force being sent to the Persian 
Gulf, based on signs that Iraq 
has moved two of its Republi­
can Guard divisions away from 
the border with Kuwait.
“The vast preponderance of 
forces we have put on alert we 
will not deploy,” announced Lt. 
Gen. Howell Estes, director of 
operations for the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. The forces being read­
ied for the Gulf, military offi­
cials explained at a Pentagon 
briefing, included a Marine di­
vision and three Army divi­
sions, or 155,000 ground troops.
Two aircraft carrier battle 
groups and a total of 608 air­
craft, including heavy B-52 
bombers, were also earmarked 
for the operation, called “Vigi­
lant Warrior,” which began on 
Oct. 7 when Iraq appeared to 
have some 75,000 troops poised 
on the Kuwaiti border, in a po­
sition to invade.
Now, just a shadow of that 
force will actually land, two- 
thirds of one Army division and 
2,000 Marines. Altogether, 
there will be about 34,000 U.S. 
servicemen in the area, with 
roughly 15,000 ground troops.
Most of the additional forces 
that were headed for the Gulf, 
including the bombers, were 
given orders yesterday to stand 
down. Showing reconnaissance 
photos of heavily laden Iraqi 
trucks and trains heading north 
bearing Soviet T-72 tanks and 
antiaircraft missiles, the mili­
tary officials cautioned that 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
could turn them around rela­
tively quickly, and that the 
situation must be continually 
monitored.
Meanwhile, Iraqi diplomats 
at the United Nations were 
preparing to sign an agreement 
that would keep most of their 
elite units north of the 32nd 
parallel, where they were be­
fore their movements were first 
noticed by U.S. intelligence on 
Oct. 5.
The military officials said the 
forces appeared to be poised 
for a limited invasion of Ku­
wait on Oct. 9 or 10, which 
could have succeeded in view 
of the light screen of Kuwaiti 
forces blocking their path.
However, rapidly moving 
U.S. forces, including Army 
units flying to Kuwait to use 
prepositioned armor brought 
in by ships, appear to have 
persuaded Saddam Hussein to 
plot a giant U-turn with his 
tank-heavy units, which were 
seen moving north on Oct. 13.
The movement, among the 
quickest deployments of force 
in U.S. history, brought F-15 
fighters to the Gulf in three 
days and a brigade of the 24th 
Mechanized Infantry Division 
within four days.
A second brigade from the 
division will continue to arrive 
in Kuwait, the officials said, 
where jt will use more of the 
prepositioned equipment in a 
large-scale exercise with Ku­
waiti forces.
Snapple faces buyout
NEW YORK, October 21 (DJ) 
— Shares of Snapple Beverage 
Corp. were up as much as 16 
percent as rumors swept the mar­
ket that the company is the sub­
ject of a buyout.
Market makers said specula­
tion focused on both PepsiCo Inc. 
and Coca-Cola Co. as the poten­
tial acquirers.
Snapple Chief Operating Of­
ficer Arnold Greenberg said the 
company doesn’t comment on 
market rumors about the case as 
it stands.
He blamed the stock’s heavy
volume on rumors and untruths, 
which he wouldn’t specify. 
PepsiCo spokesman Dick 
Detwiler declined to comment, 
citing company policy.
“We get calls every week on 
rumors that we’re buying or sell­
ing,” he said.
A Coca-Cola spokeswoman also 
declined to comment on the situ­
ation.
Snapple shares were up 21/2, 
or 20 percent, at 15 on Nasdaq 
volume of 3.4 million, compared 
with average daily volume of 1.3 
million.
Democrats face tough election month
WASHINGTON, October 20 (DJ) — 
Dem ocrats confront an incre asingly hos- 
tile national climate just 19 days before 
they face voters in congressional elec­
tions, even though Americans' assess­
ment of Président Clinton has warmed 
up, a new poll suggests, thanks to gen­
eral satisfaction with his handling of 
tensions in Haiti and Iraq. Mr. Clinton 
is earning higher marks across the board 
for his job performance, according to a 
new Wall Street Journal/NBC News 
poll.
But there’s little sign of a spillover 
effect for the Democratic Party . In fact, 
the overall picture appears darker for 
Democrats than it did just a month ago.
In the new survey, 41 percent of those 
registered to vote said they plan to vote 
for the Republican candidate in their
congressional district this fall, while 36 per­
cent said they plan to %’dte for the Democrat.
The new poll marks the first time this year 
that voters overall have expressed a prefer­
ence for Republican congressional candidates. 
By contrast, just last month Democrats had a 
slight edge among registered voters, 39 per­
cent to 36 percent.
What’s more, the picture looks bleaker for 
the Democrats among those Americans who 
are most likely to turn out on Election Day, 
Nov. 8.
While Republicans enjoy a five-point edge 
among registered voters generally, that ad­
vantage widens to eight points among regis­
tered voters who are most likely to vote.
The latter group said by a 44 percent to 36 
percent margin that they intend to vote for the 
Republican candidate in their district.
Taken together,those attitudes suggest that
the coming election may not be as much a 
referendum on President Clinton as com­
monly thought, but will tum more on deeper 
dissatisfaction with Congress and the Demo­
crats there. Indeed, 54 perc'ent of the regis­
tered voters surveyed said that a congres­
sional candidate’s support of . or opposition 
to, President Clinton wouldn’t be a factorin 
voting.
The silver lining for Democrats is the 
¦uptick in the public’s rating of Mr. Clinton’s 
performance.
Among all adults, 48 percent, said they 
approve of Mr. Clinton's overall job perfor­
mance, while 43 percent disapprove. That 
represents a four-point increase in the 
president’s job-approval rating since last 
month, when more Americans voiced disap­
proval than approval. That’s a 13-point jump 
from 32 percent last month.
Budget deficit goes to public
WASHINGTON, October 21 
(DJ) — The Clinton administra­
tion will publish its official fiscal 
1994 federal budget deficit esti­
mate on Monday, and President 
Clinton will make an election­
time speech about the figures in 
Cleveland. Officials say the Of­
fice of Management and Budget 
and the Treasury Department 
will jointly announce official cal­
culations of last year’s red ink. 
Most private sector estimates peg 
the fiscal 1994 deficit at about 
$200 billion, down from $255 bil­
lion in 1993 and $290 billion in 
1992.
The deficit in fiscal 1995 is 
generally projected to decline to 
roughly $175 billion. Also on 
Monday, Clinton flies to Cleve­
land, where he will deliver a 
speech to the Cleveland City Club 
in which he is expected to talk 
about the deficit numbers. “It’s 
important for people to know that 
the deficit-reduction plan that 
was passed last year is working,” 
said Gene Sperling, deputy assis­
tant to the president for economic 
affairs.
The numbers will show a “sub­
stantial reduction in the deficit” 
in fiscal 1994 versus 1993, he 
said. Sperling said that although 
politicians have been talking 
about deficit reduction for a long 
time, this marks the first time 
that deficits are actually being 
reduced. “That’s not speculation, 
that’s a fact,” Sperling said. Al-
though the figures deal with last 
year’s budget, the remarks war­
rant special attention because 
Clinton sits in the cross-hairs of a 
debate about his future deficit 
policy.
Although deficits are projected 
to keep declining through fiscal 
1995, deficit projections increase 
each year after that into the next 
century. Before health-care re­
form legislation died, adminis­
tration officials had said that an 
overhaul of the health system 
would cut future deficits.Stanford to pay US
PALO ALTO, California, Octo­
ber 19 (DJ) — Stanford Univer­
sity said it agreed to pay the U.S. 
government $1.2 million to settle 
a controversy over billing prac­
tices that triggered the resigna­
tion of its president, Donald 
Kennedy, in 1991. The Wall Street 
Journal reported.
The scandal erupted over the 
way the university accounted for 
indirect costs of federally spon­
sored research, such as equip­
ment needed to support campus 
research efforts.
Stanford was found to have in­
cluded in its billings such ex­
penses as a cedar closet in Mr. 
Kennedy’s home and deprecia­
tion on a 72-foot yacht.
The latest payment comes on 
top of $2.2 million in expenses 
that were billed improperly and 
were previously withdrawn by the 
university.
Under terms of the settlement,
Stanford and the Office of Naval 
Research, the federal agency that 
oversees the university’s research 
accounts, have resolved all mat­
ters related to indirect-cost bill­
ings between 1981 andl992.Clinton plans trip to Syria
WASHINGTON, October 21 
(D J) — Hoping to nudge forward 
the peace process during his visit 
to the Middle East, President 
Clinton is expanding his itiner­
ary to include a visit to Syria next 
week.
The Thursday visit with Presi- 
dentHafez Assad will give Clinton 
a chance to press the Syrians for 
a compromise in slow-moving 
negotiations with the Israelis. 
Clinton saw Assad in January in 
Geneva and said he found the 
Arab leader disposed to reaching 
a settlement.
But five trips by Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher have 
not broken a deadlock over the 
Golan Heights, the Israeli-held 
enclave that Assad wants to get 
back.
Clinton also would like to visit 
religious sites in Jerusalem on 
his first trip to the Middle East as 
president, but security concerns 
may stand in the way.
Clinton departs on Tuesday, 
flying first to Egypt to see Presi­
dent Hosni Mubarak, in a tribute 
to the Egyptian leader, who has 
assisted both the Bush and 
Clinton administrations in their 
efforts to reconcile Israel and the 
Arabs.
CBM fined for storing waste
EAST RUTHERFORD, New 
Jersey, October 21 (DJ) — The 
U.S. Attorney’s Office in Newark 
said CasChem Inc., a unit of 
Cambrex Corp. (CBM), agreed to 
pay a $1 million fine for storing 
hazardous waste for more than 
90 days without a permit. In a 
press release, the attorney’s of­
fice said CasChem stored thou­
sands of drums containing off- 
specification product, unknown 
materials, and hazardous waste 
at a pier on Newark Bay from 
1989 through 1990. The 
attorney’s office said the pier was 
not at CasChem’s Bayonne manu­
facturing site, but was rented 
from another company. The 
attorney’s office also said 
CasChem’s former regulatory af­
fairs manager, Stuart Cooper, 
pleaded guilty to federal misde­
meanor charges relating to the 
storage.
In a separate press release, 
Cambrex said it actively defended 
the case for more than four and a 
half years, and agreed to the 
settlement to avoid large legal 
fees associated with a lengthy 
trial.

MCS awarded research grant
Grant will help develop portable science program
By HEATHER ZINDLE
Tartan Staffwriter
On October 4,1994:Camegie 
Mellon University’s MellonCol- 
lege of Science received a $1.5 
million dollar grant from the 
Howard Hughes Mcdical Insti­
tute, the nation’s largest pri­
vate philanthropic medical re­
search organization. It will be 
awarded over four years for use 
in life sciences.
The grant is the only one 
given to a college in southwest­
ern Pennsylvania, and one of $86 million in four-year grants 
to 62 research and doctorate- 
granting universities in the 
nation. It is also the second 
grant that the Mellon College 
of Science has received from 
the Howard Hughes Medical 
Institute.
This grant will be used to 
create a portable science pro­
gram for area teachers and 
make vital improvements to its
undergraduate laboratories. Ac­
cording to Mellon College of Sci­
ence Dean Susan Henry, the new 
funding “will be used to continue 
successful teacher outreach pro­
grams and to pay for laboratory 
renovations. More than half of 
the funding will be used to de­
velop a new undergraduate labo­
ratory for the study of cell devel­
opment and developmental biol­
ogy.” The $1.5 million dollars 
will also be used to start a new 
science outreach prajeetfor Pitts­
burgh schools.
This project will enable sci­
ence teachers to loan many mate­
rials, such as pre-tested equip­
ment and experimental kits to 
enable the students to experi­
ence “hands on” science. Accord­
ing to Henry, “the Mellon College 
of Science will continue its train­
ing programs for local elemen­
tary and secondary school sci­
ence teachers that include lab 
experience, computer workshops, 
and work with multimedia teach­
ing tools.”
There are also plans to create 
summer research programs for 
Pittsburgh-area minority stu­
dents who aspire to a career in 
science.
“We believethe direct involve­
ment of students with faculty 
in research laboratories can 
play a powerful role in motivat­
ing students to pursue careers 
in the sciences,” Henry said.
Mellon College of Science’s 
first HHMI grant of $1.2 mil­
lion dollars in 1989 helped to 
create a number of outreach 
programs.
A summer research program 
in biology attracted under­
graduate students, including 
minority students, from around 
the nation. Workshops for high 
school teachers from 
Pittsburgh’s public schools were 
also developed and the college 
implemented new college pro­
grams in computational biol­
ogy and chemistry.

performing at 9 pm on Thurs­
day, and Anne Rosmus at 7:30 
pm on Friday.
GSO (Craig Brown): No
report
Greek Council: No report.
Faculty Senate (Anne 
Shields): At the October 6 
meeting, three issues were 
brought up. Two dealt with 
tenure and reappointments, 
and Dr. Mehrabian spoke about 
the goals of the University.
Student Affairs (Kevin
Hughes): A reminder that this 
weekend is the International 
Festival and Family Weekend, 
and that after getting a change 
of address you should contact 
the Registrar’s office.
President (Declan 
McCullagh): We toured the 
Sikbo pit on October 7. At the 
Student Government meeting 
last Thurs., we talked with 
Dining Services, and found that 
there has been no decision on 
the PH/BH carts, and that the 
move to Building D could be 
delayed until winter break.
The Presidential Committee 
on dining will meet this week, 
it is waiting for nominations 
from the Greek Council and the 
Staff Council.
Cosponsored the Nina Behr 
lecture last week with the 
PSFB. Met with the Pitt 
student government last Wed. 
to talk about shuttle services.
A student government summit 
will be held after their elec­
tions.
Treasurer (Emma 
Gosden): All accounts fine 
except for Lacrosse and The 
Tartan. The Lacrosse account 
has been frozen. The Tartan 
has accumulated a deficit of 
$19,525.45 as of this week. A 
payment plan is being worked 
on, several proposals have been 
submitted by both sides. A 
proposal must be in place by 
next Wed., or all billings will 
have to be approved by senate.
Discussion: A discussion 
followed the Treasurer’s report. 
Some points brought up in­
cluded: The proposals were not 
discussed with The Tartan 
before being submitted. The 
money has already been paid by 
the senate, all money collected 
from The Tartan will be put 
into a fund for the new Student 
Center. There should be a 
meeting where the Tartan and 
the senate resolve their differ­
ences.
The Tartan’s 8 year payment 
plan ties up the money for too 
long. The Tartan should receive 
notice before any proposals are 
voted on by the senate.
A suggestion was made that 
all funds not spent during the 
year should be applied to next 
year’s budget.

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The proposal is on the table 
and has yet to be voted on, but 
Educational Facilities Commit­
tee (EFC) chairman Edwin 
Fenton is confident that renova­
tion of Gregg Hall (PH 100) will 
proceed. Replacing the cumber­
some tablet-arm seats alone 
would cost an estimated 
$125,000, and Fenton contends 
that the hall also needs a data 
projector and an updated sound 
system. If Gregg Hall is to be 
renovated, final decisions on just 
what that will entail must be 
made by January. Designers 
would be able to prepare before 
May, when actual construction 
would take place. The construc­
tion would be purposely sched­
uled so not to conflict with classes.
A renovation of Gregg Hall 
would be the latest in a long se­
ries of improvements undertaken 
by the EFC since its start about 
ten years ago. In 1984, CMUwas 
facing a crisis as many classrooms 
were growing increasingly obso­
lete. The rooms were plagued with 
subpar lighting and acoustics, a 
lack of carpeting and insufficient 
chalkboard space.
The EFC was founded to rectify 
this situation. The University 
doubled its spending on class­
room maintenance to $300,000. 
Since 1984, a total of $3 million 
has been given to the EFC by the 
University. Over the past eight 
years, the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania has been donating 
money to colleges, (based on num­
ber of Pennsylvanians enrolled), 
to upgrade the classrooms. CMU 
has received a total of $1 million 
of these funds.
The EFC meets about five times 
per year. The committee assesses 
the needs of the classrooms in a 
handful of ways. Every other year 
a questionnaire is distributed to 
the faculty in which they may 
voice whatever complaints or con­
cerns they have. During the win­
ter break, subcommittees go from 
room to room, deciding where 
renovations may be necessary. 
The rooms are also checked upon 
weekly by a retired teacher who
distributes work orders for what- i 
ever repairs seem necessary. I 
Input from students is also ap- j. 
preciated by the EFC. However, 
apathy and/or ignorance comes' 
into play, as students don’t seem 
to voice their thoughts about the I 
classrooms. Fenton notes this 
trend with slight chagrin but 1 
readily insists that the EFC is ! 
always open to student sugges- ; 
tions. Through its years of ser­
vice, the EFC has modernized 
CMU’s lecture halls and class- • 
rooms. Absent only after a few 
years ago, video monitors are now 
in 19 rooms and data projectors 
in 31. rooms, respectively. Every 
week, Industrial Technology re­
ports whatever maintenance 
problems it finds to Physical 
Plant, which proceeds to repair 
them. Both Fenton and H&SS 
chair of Academic Affairs Kami 
White maintain that such atten­
tion to renovation and mainte­
nance stems from a genuine be­
lief by the University that qual­
ity of education is indeed affected 
by the quality of the classroom 
itself.
Academic Affairs (Kami 
White): We are introducing 
two new surveys, one about 
classroom furniture and the 
other about online registration. 
It has been agreed that PH 100 
will undergo renovation, at a 
cost of roughly $125,000. 
Meetings are Mondays at 4:00 
in the senate office.
Campus Affairs (Cheryl 
Gach): We met with security to 
organize the Security Council, 
with the Dining Committee, 
and with the University Com­
mittees. Meetings are at 6:00 
on Tuesday in the third floor 
Morewood AB Lounge.
Funding and Recognition 
(Merle Atkinson): 3 budgets 
will be up for a vote next week. 
Meetings are at 7:00 on Mon­
days at 5105 Forbes Ave.
Human Resources (Troy 
Benowitz): We are scheduling 
a Leadership Conference for the 
middle of next term and are 
preparing a list of funded and 
non-funded organizations. We 
meet Wednesday nights at 6:00.
Email tvOO for more informa­
tion.
Public Relations (Eduardo 
Gonzalez): Petitions were 
distributed in Highlander and 
Morewood. Meetings are at 
4:45 in the Senate Lounge
Chair (Burt Holzman): I
have key cards for those who 
need them. We have a new 
secretary, Ben Bostwick. Don’t 
be afraid to bring up concerns 
about resolutions, don’t be 
afraid to vote against them.

“Unless you’re actually there,

Motley feels Campus Security 
has to be less antagonistic. “They 
have to be more sensitive to the 
situations they put people in. For 
them to surround me like they
did was completely uncalled for. I 
felt intimidated and I overreacted. 
For overreacting to a situation, 
now I have an arrest record and I 
had to sit in jail for 18 hours.”
Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy declined to com­
ment on the case, but said that 
Campus Security officers “have a 
tough job” and are careful to use 
the “minimal intervention neces­
sary” when dealing with students.
Murphy believes The Tartan 
shouldn’t have printed the names 
of the students. “I don’t believe 
the individuals’ names are news. 
The historical practice has been 
that crime and incident issues 
are done anonymously,” he said.

Martin Luther King 
Day must be observed
Letters to the Editor
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
was a central leader in the civil 
rights movement that changed 
the face of the nation. His birth­
day, will be celebrated on Janu­
ary 16th this year. It is a day 
when the country observes and 
celebrates both King’s influence 
in history and the visions he 
had. Despite the significance of 
Martin Luther King Day to this 
country, the national hohday will 
not be observed by CMU. In fact, 
the first day of the spring 1995 
semester is on January 16th, 
Martin Luther King Day.
Almost every public institu­
tion in the country has taken 
this day off since former Presi­
dent Bush declared it a National 
Holiday. But taking the day off 
here would most likely mean 
staying out late the night be­
fore, sleeping in the next day, 
catching up on work; basically 
treating this day like any other 
day off. What would seem more 
respectful to the holiday, and 
provide more impact on the uni­
versity community, would be to 
organize various programs and 
events for the upcoming day in 
January.
The events would express and 
elaborate on different aspects of 
the process of civil rights in this 
country and in others, the racial 
diversity and history of CMU,
Picture yourselfin a classroom. 
It’s sunny out but you wouldn’t 
know it because you have been 
in classrooms all day long. You 
have a class which adjourned 10 
minutes before this one, and 
another which begins 10 min­
utes after this one. As your eyes 
drift towards your left wrist, the 
awareness strikes you: it’s 20 
after.
You’re going to be late for your 
next class. Anxiously, you look 
at the door, your watch, the other 
students (who are currently busy 
looking at the door, their watch, 
the other students) and then to 
the professor, who notices the 
air getting thinner and says, 
“OK, I can see that it’s time to 
go, but before you do, let me just 
say one more thing ....”
Is this scene familiar? The “10- 
inning class” is an incident that 
seems to resurface daily, and it’s 
annoying.
It decreases the credibility of 
the teacher who would scold a 
student for being late to class 
when that teacher is possibly 
causing that student to be late 
for his or her next class.
Some teachers will defend their 
actions by saying that it is im­
possible to send the students off 
to do their homework half- 
cocked. While this displays good 
intentions, it is irrelevant to stu­
dents.
The needs of the students are 
the main issue here. When a 
student needs to get to his or her 
next class, and yet are stuck 
listening to the endless drivel of 
a lecturer lacking in eloquence, 
they find themselves in a conun­
drum.
Trying to get ready to leave by
African-American history and 
culture, and issues in today’s 
society relevant to what Kang 
fought for. Showing relevant 
movies in 2210 and having 
speakers and performers visit 
the campus would do a lot more 
for the campus community than 
either taking the day for sleep 
or having classes.
The celebration of King’s 
birthday, or lack thereof, has 
been an issue for several years. 
Some professors cancel their 
classes on Martin Luther King 
day to make a statement to the 
university that the holiday 
should be observed.
Of all the national holidays 
that the United States cel­
ebrates, this holiday is one of 
the most pertinent. Civil Rights 
issues are still a high priority in 
society, and as a university com­
munity, we put ourselves at a 
disadvantage by not putting 
more emphasis on and effort 
into the observation of this hoh­
day.
Cultural awareness cannot 
hurt but in absence. People 
should know, and more impor­
tantly, care, about what Martin 
Luther Kang Day represents, 
and turn this knowledge toward 
making this a stronger commu­
nity, instead of just calling it 
one.
packing up their material not 
only makes noise that inter­
feres with the lecture, but also 
deprives the student of possibly 
valuable notes, as well as any 
handouts the teacher might be 
giving at the end of class. Get­
ting up and walking towards 
the door is generally treated as 
an interference to the class, and 
the studentis sheepishly stared 
down by an angry professor for 
the action. The fact that the 
time is up just doesn’t seem to 
matter anymore, and this is 
unfair to all involved. It’s like 
having to go to the bathroom 
when the score is tied at the 
bottom of the ninth with two 
down, and a full count of three 
and two.
The solutions are simple, but 
they involve the cooperation of 
the faculty. First, a policy should 
be created that allows the stu­
dents the unconditional liberty 
of leaving the classroom when 
the proverbial bell rings, with­
out having to suffer the wrath 
of the professor.
We’re not saying this policy 
should be strictly enforced, only 
that the student should have 
something to defend themselves 
with, should their backs be to 
the wall.
Next, there should be digital 
clocks set in every classroom, 
displaying a sort of “CMU uni­
versal time”, giving all teachers 
and students a guideline by 
which to set their own personal 
timepieces.
Students pay for a service. In 
the same way that people pay 
for getting a muffler changed. 
Therefore, they need to be 
treated with a little respect.
SARC official defends picnic
Editor:
In response to 
your editorial 
[“Homecoming pic- 
nic fails to fulfill pur­
poses,” 10/10], I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
clarify a few points.
You incorrectly stated that the Office 
of Special Events and Dining Services 
made the decision to move the picnic 
indoors. It was not SARC’s, Special 
Events’, nor Dining Service’s decision to 
determine whether the picnic should or 
should not be moved indoors. It was the 
Office of Alumni Relations who ulti­
mately made the choice at 7:00 AM (in 
the rain) on Saturday morning to move 
the picnic inside. At that time, we made 
the best possible decision due to the 
weather. Once the call was made we 
couldn’t reverse our decision because of 
the early set-ups required for the event.
Second, SARC (contrary to what the 
editorial cartoon indicated) did not ben­
efit monetarily from the Senate alloca­
tion. The $2,500 SARC received will be 
spent as originally intended—to pay for 
the students’ picnic lunches. Neither 
SARC nor the Office of Alumni Rela­
tions profits on this event — in fact, we 
provided an additional $3,134 in pay for 
student lunches that day!
The Office of Alumni Relations and 
SARC went out of our way this year to 
provide student and alumni interaction 
during Homecoming. We successfully 
sponsored the Student/Alumni Home­
coming Dinner at Soldiers and Sailors 
where students were seated with alumni, 
a networking seminar and the High­
lander Games on Saturday morning 
(alumni were referees and even partici­
pated in the games), a free reunion for 
classes of’94 and ’95 after the game, and 
the free concert on Saturday night for 
students and alumni to enjoy.
We are now planning Homecoming 
1995, and we welcome your suggestions. 
Please feel free to drop by the Alumni 
House with your ideas or send email to 
sb7d. Our goal is to make Homecoming 
a fun and memorable experience for 
alumni and students.

Office of Alumni RelationsCluster services getting upgrade
Editor:
Recently, The Tar­
tan carried an edito­
rial [“Students need 
better access to com­
puting,” 10/3]. The 
basic message of the editorial — that 
demand within the public clusters often 
exceeds the supply of computers avail­
able in those clusters—is one that many 
of us recognize and which has been the 
topic of numerous discussions over the 
past year and a half. Those discussions 
have taken place within Computing Ser­
vices and also in broader university 
groups and committees. It is also a mes­
sage that Computing Services high­
lighted when its visiting Advisory Board
met this past spring.
While Computing Services and the 
University administration worktogether 
to arrive at long-term solutions, we are 
also implementing and planning pro­
grams that provide some relief to the 
access difficulties in clusters. Within 
the clusters, we have changed the way 
we handle repairs so that same-day or 
next-day equipment repair is now rou­
tine. We have also stepped up our hiring 
and training program so that consult­
ants are hired and begin working earlier 
in the semester. (This year thirty new 
consultants were hired, trained, and on 
the job by the beginning of the third 
week of the semester; last year it took 
more than a month for the first newly- 
hired consultants to begin staffing clus­
ters.)
Also, other groups in Computing Ser­
vices have proposed creative programs 
to help support individual student own­
ership (thereby reducing some of the 
tension on the public clusters). For ex­
ample, the Computer Store is develop­
ing financing alternatives for student 
purchases. Other members of Comput­
ing Services are investigating the feasi­
bility of allowing students in dorms to 
“subscribe” to cluster software and have 
it accessible on the computers they own. 
Clearly these kinds of programs would 
only be a small part of an overall solu­
tion. However, they do represent a first 
step that is feasible for us to take today. 
Our goal in the clusters is to provide 
good and consistent service to the Uni­
versity community. If you have any ques­
tions, comments (good or bad), or sug­
gestions, please let us know. You can 
contact the student cluster managers of 
a given cluster by sending electronic 
mail to <cluster>-management 
+@andrew (for example, mmp- 
management+@andrew; finger “man­
agement” on Andrew for a listing of all of 
the cluster addresses). You can commu­
nicate with the full time staff respon­
sible for the clusters by sending mail to 
clusters+@andrew. If you would like to 
meet with me personally, please send 
mail to tf01+@andrew.
Tracy Futhey 
Director, User ServicesCMU caved in under lawsuit
Editor:
I find the recent 
settlement of the 
wrongful termina­
tion suit of Patrick 
Mooney alarming 
[“Former RA resolves lawsuit,” 10/10]. 
The implication from Mooney being sat­
isfied with the result is that Carnegie 
Mellon caved in to one degree or an­
other. The idea that CMU would reach a 
settlement with someone who holds to 
basic tenets that “did not tolerate homo­
sexuals” seems to set an unfortunate 
precedent. Is CMU, and the nation as a 
whole, expected to offer jobs to people 
who clearly are not capable of interact­
ing on a reasonable basis with both their 
peers and those whom they should be 
serving? Is CMU next going to start 
allowing known racists to become resi­
dent assistants? In my mind, both of 
these actions are very similar.
In some sense, the entire issue of
Mooney and the accompanying contro­
versy has been to reach a compromise ¦ 
between his rights as an individual and 
the rights of the society in which he 
lives. As an RA, he would have been 
reasonably expected to maintain a safe 
living environment free of abuse for all 
his residents, regardless of their sex, 
sexual preferences, race, religion, color 
of shoes, etc. It is not clear that Mooney 
was capable of doing this or was even 
willing to put forth an effort to try and do 
so for people who were not tolerated by 
his rigid Catholic beliefs. Such a ques­
tion when applied to an RA appears to 
me to be just cause for termination. 
After living in various kinds of dormito­
ries for four years of my life, I don’t see 
it as reasonable to expect people to live 
with an RA who is openly hostile to 
something that is inherently part of 
them. I believe that Mooney would not 
be happy to be a resident on a hall where 
the RA sought to persecute Catholics...
According to The Tartan, Amy Ginther 
had “questioned Mooney’s ability to be 
sensitive to residents that were openly 
homosexual.” For most types of work, it 
is not wrongful termination to termi­
nate an employee based on a superior 
questioning his or her abilities.
My fear, although unsupported by 
documentation, is that CMU was, in 
essence, cheap and lazy. Mooney mus­
tered enough bright lights and money 
that CMU chose to take the easy way out 
rather than prolong the issue. From a 
purely pragmatic viewpoint, this was 
the easiest thing to do. Unfortunately, 
in my humble opinion, this was not the 
right thing to do. It would be nice if our 
administration had stood up and fought 
an important issue rather than compro­
mise ideals.

Very good of you 
to review the latest

[“Sugar lightens up

in referring to Bob Mould as both the 
father of grunge and someone not con­
fined by it. (I like to think of Mould as 
Ethel Merman crossed with Pete 
Townsend, or kind of an Alternative 
Elvis, in a way.) File Under: Easy Listen­

done by Mould/Sugar, excluding the

Disciplinary process mystery unveiled
Declan McCullagh
The disciplinary process and the Univer­
sity Committee on Discipline (UDC) intimi­
date students, says Pat Hamed, assistant to 
the Dean of Student Affairs and former disci­
plinary process coordinator. “People come in 
and think we’re going to throw them out 
without hearing their side. That’s not true. I 
go out of my way to tell them the purpose of 
the process is so they can tell their side,” she 
says.
The UDC is a committee composed of two 
students and three faculty or staff members. 
They decide if a student’s actions violated 
University policy and what punishment is 
appropriate.
Having students serve on the committee is 
important, says Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy. “Our objective was to in­
crease the use of the existing UDC structure 
and make sure that students have the oppor­
tunity to have the dispute heard by their 
peers. You may not like the outcome, but you 
should feel you were treated fairly by people 
who are unbiased and concerned about the 
welfare of the community.”
The disciplinary process works well in most
cases. Students caught gazorching or ex­
ploring the underground steam tunnels 
come before the UDC in a closed hearing 
and receive penalties ranging from fines 
and disciplinary probation to suspension 
and expulsion in more serious cases.
“A gazorch is a three-person slingshot. 
With it, you can throw something 100 to 
150 yards. One day I saw someone in the 
quad with a bowl of macaroni salad and a 
gazorch over his shoulder. He said, ‘Pat, 
you’d better leave the quad now.’ I left 
and called Campus Police,” says Harned.
But the process which works so well for 
routine incidents starts to break down 
when issues become more complex.
Carnegie Mellon’s current disciplinary 
policy says, “Actions of all disciplinary 
groups on the campus are confidential... 
These materials are to be kept confiden­
tial and may be shared only with those 
necessary.”
However, the policy doesn’t say what 
happens if a student accused of a policy 
violation releases information about the 
case. This doesn’t happen often, but it 
happened in one well-publicized case last 
semester when a professor charged a stu­
dent with harassment.
Assistant Drama Professor Tim 
Satemow charged a student with harass­
ment based on sexual orientation, in a
letter sent to Murphy in March. Murphy 
forwarded the letter to the student.
“[The student] left the letter on his 
desk and his Mends came and took it. 
My letter. His letter. All the information 
leading up to the hearing. And then my 
letter appeared in the Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette and The Washington Times,” 
says Saternow.
Saternow said he received threaten­
ing phone calls and lost work because of 
the publicity. “This harassment has not 
just cost me lost sleep, but part of my 
livelihood.”
To prevent this from happening, the 
policy must be changed to protect the 
confidentiality ofthe hearings, especially 
in sensitive cases.
The disciplinary process should also 
be improved by releasing general infor­
mation about cases that are heard by 
UDCs.
Right now, Campus Police only pub­
lishes statistics on campus crimes when 
the student is arrested and the crime is 
prosecuted through the City of Pitts­
burgh justice system. Since many crimes 
like sexual assaults are handled through 
our disciplinary process, this practice 
conceals many serious crimes that hap­
pen on campus.
In fact, Campus Police’s Uniform
Crime Reporting statistics indicate there 
hasn’t been a rape or sexual assault on 
campus for the last five years.
That’s misleading at best.
Murphy says he hears of five to ten 
sexual assaults at Carnegie Mellon each 
semester, but it reflects only a small 
percentage of the actual assaults that 
occur. “Our estimation, using national 
figures, is that the number may be closer 
to 50,” he said in an interview with The 
Tartan last year.
The campus community soon will know 
more about the number and types of 
crimes handled through the disciplinary 
process. Anne Shields, Associate Dean of 
Student Affairs, says her office will re­
lease summary information for three 
years of incidents by the end of Novem­
ber.
Shields’ willingness to listen to stu­
dents’ concerns is encouraging. Her deci­
sion to release information about crimes 
that happen on campus will make the 
campus community more aware of the 
danger of campus crime and will make 
the University a better, and ultimately 
safer, place for students.

Our rights end where others’ rights begin
/'tv-
Matt Ball
More than any other country, 
the United States of America was 
founded on the ideal of individual 
rights. The rights of each citizen 
acted as the pre-eminent prin­
ciple of the founding of this na­
tion. The government was to ex­
ist neither as an end in itself, nor 
as some entity greater than the 
sum of the citizens. Rather, it 
was intended as a power of the 
people, for the people, and by the 
people, to protect the rights and 
freedom of individual citizens.
Freedom is not an absolute, 
however, to be pursued in an an­
archistic manner. Law and order 
exist so the philosophy of “might
makes right” may not become the 
de facto ruler in the land. The 
more powerful are, in theory, to 
have no more rights than the 
weaker and less powerful. Each 
individual is to have some funda­
mental rights and freedoms that 
cannot be infringed upon by oth­
ers, even if protecting the rights 
of the weaker tends to infringe on 
the “rights” of others. For ex­
ample, your right to swing your 
fists stops at my nose. Or, in the 
words of P. J. O’Rourke, “There is 
only one basic human right: the 
right to do as you please unless it 
causes others harm.”
In this sense, smoking in an 
enclosed public space exceeds the 
fundamental rights and freedoms 
that rest at the heart of the basic 
philosophy of the United States. 
Smoking goes to the point of caus­
ing others harm, infringing on
their rights to live unharmed by 
the actions of others.
The full range of health im­
pacts of secondhand smoke is not 
yet fully understood. It is pos­
sible that inhaling secondhand 
smoke will lead to an elevated 
risk of fatal lung cancer in the 
average adult. It is known that
elderly have no specific economic 
or political power, especially when 
pitted against the business class. 
If the government — the people 
of the United States — is to pro­
tect minorities from the tyranny 
of the majority, this would be an 
appropriate case.
Some would argue that the free
oUivMls sint gi gyn ’iMlg iS MlSrMlsu
Mls il gyn rMsyg gi dMNn wlyprUnac
secondhand smoke has harmful 
effects on others in the general 
public. There is little serious sci­
entific doubt that children, asth­
matics, the elderly, and those al­
lergic are all adversely impacted 
by secondhand smoke.
It is perhaps most compelling 
to note that those impacted are 
the minority. Children and the
market should be left to regulate 
itself; if the demand for smoke- 
free environments exists, then 
these markets would be met. Al­
though this sounds reasonable in 
principle, it is far from the way 
the US has traditionally oper­
ated. Did the citizens of this coun­
try leave it to the free market to 
end slavery, promote civil rights,
protect the environment from pol­
luters, or track the spread of AIDS 
and look for the cause? Is it really 
democratic and equitable to tell 
children going to school, the eld­
erly flying to visit family, or even 
the asthmatics waiting to receive 
specialized treatment, “Sorry, but 
it’s not cost-effective to provide 
you with a clean environment. If 
you paid enough, you could pro­
tect your health, your growth, 
your development”?
It may not be the government’s 
place (speaking on behalf of its 
citizens) to say that it is unac­
ceptable for people to kill them­
selves by smoking. However, it is 
the government’s place to protect 
others from the choices of smok-

Second amendment protects us from unlikely foes
James Stepanek
Has everyone completely forgotten about 
the second amendment? It’s pretty straight­
forward: “A well regulated militia being nec­
essary to the security of a free state, the right 
ofthe people to keep and bear arms shall not 
be infringed.” I often wonder what part of 
“shall not be infringed” people don’t under­
stand.
Many claim that the second amendment is 
an anachronism. It isn’t. The right to self- 
defense from criminals or a criminal govern­
ment is no less valid today than in the time of 
the founding fathers.
Ever hear of Randy Weaver? He’s a man 
who ran afoul ofthe federal government, and 
boy did he pay for it. What was his crime? He 
sold two shotguns allegedly of a length 1/4-
inch under the legal limit to an under­
cover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms (BATF) agent who badgered 
him to sell them.
This lead to Weaver having a court date 
set. He showed up on this date and was 
informed that a new date had been set— 
and the wrong date at that. He lived in 
what is technically referred to as “the 
middle of nowhere” in northern Idaho. 
After being jerked around over the court 
date he decided to just give up, and re­
turned to his cabin with his family and a 
friend. This led to his missing the next 
court date.
How did the government respond? It 
sent, in the FBI Hostage Rescue Team 
(read: snipers) and some BATF agents 
equipped for an assault. You know, the 
ninja style get-ups with the submachine 
guns and body armor.
Weaver’s friend, Kevin Harris, and his 
son, Sammy, went to check on some noises
that had disturbed their dog. They heard 
a gunshot which killed the dog, and 
Sammy fired a shot in the direction from 
which it had come. The BATF agent 
returned fire (lots), and Sammy and 
Harris ran back towards the house. 
Sammy Weaver was shot in the back 
and killed. Harris returned fire, killing 
the agent, but was wounded in the ex­
change by yet another agent. Mind you, 
no warrant was presented, nor any ID 
shown; these could have been any com­
mon thugs hiding in the woods for all 
they knew.
The BATF and FBI put the Weaver’s 
home under siege. Sammy’s body had 
been laid in state in a shed near the 
cabin. When Weaver went out to grieve, 
the FBI snipers opened fire, wounding 
him. Weaver’s wife, with their infant 
daughter in her arms, held the door 
open so that he could get back inside; an 
FBI sniper shot her in the head, killing
her. The baby and Weaver were lacer­
ated by bone fragments.
The siege continued until Bo Gritz, a 
local veteran and survivalist, managed 
to talk Weaver into surrendering. Weaver 
and Harris were taken to court and exon­
erated of all charges, except for Randy’s 
missing of a court date. The actions ofthe 
federal government have been investi­
gated, but the report is being ignored by 
Attorney General Reno.
Some of you might think that I made 
this up. I didn’t. This is the honest truth. 
This did happen. These people died. This 
should scare you — it still has me dis­
turbed. People wonder why we have the 
second amendment. Is the government 
ever likely to be a threat? Just ask Randy 
Weaver.
James Stepanek is a PhD student in 
MSE who thinks that a government which 
fears an armed citizenry should.
Last week brought CMU’s 
International Festival to 
campus. Lectures, films, con­
certs, food and wine tastings, 
and various other events took 
place. We wondered how 
many students were aware 
of what was going on, and 
asked: What do you think 
of the publicity for the 
International Festival?

The CMU men’s soccer team’s play­

games on Friday with a 2-1 comeback the weekend.

Their 3-1-1 UAA record keeps them in 
contention for the league title.
The top four teams from each region 
qualify for the national playoffs.
The bright spot of the weekend was 
the play of freshman Akira Imai, who 
scored all three of CMLPs goals. Seniors 
Mike Brazinski, Pat Lucignani, and Alex 
Amezquita also picked up assists over
Rochester scored 
only 1:31 into their 
game, but Imai tallied 
his first goal at 33:14 
from Brazinski and 
Lucignani, and then 
scored unassisted at 
66:31 for the game 
winner.
Brandeis’ Ken

The size of the field disrupted CMU’s

that was tough on us.”

ued its unbeaten string, tying Roches­
ter 1—1, and then 
defeating Brand­
eis, 1-0. The Tar­
tans are now 12—

1-0 at 52:53, but 10 minutes later, 
freshman Kim

game, with assists 
from junior Maria Casella and sopho­

Against Brand-eis, senior Julie Paul 
scored the lone goal on a Casella as­
sist, while sophomore Jill Weber picked 
up the shutout.
Ranked seventh in the Great Lakes 
Region in the last poll, the Tartans 
are trying to make it to fourth so 
they will qualify for the national

but the weekend’s wins should help 
them move up in the rankings.

CMU splits first two UAA games
By JOHN WEBER
Tartan Staffwriter
On Saturday, 0 ctober 15th, the 
Tartans opened their UAA con- 
¡ference schedule against the 
Washington Bears in St. Louis,
! Missouri. The Tartans were try­
ing to get back on track after the 
heart breaking loss at home to 
the Merchant Marine Academy, 
but it was not to be. In front of a 
crowd of just over 600 people, the 
Tartans lostfor the third time this 
year by a score of 36- 
25. Saturday, how­
ever, the Tartans fi­
nally broke a two- 
game losing streak 
with a 44-6 thumping 
of the Chicago Ma­
roons at Gesling Sta­
dium in front of over2,000 home townfans.
A dangerous trend 
by the Tartans as of 
late is letting their 
opponents get the first 
score. Against the 
: Bears, that is exactly 
! what they let happen.
! After an early Tartan 
j Punt and a 38-yard 
i return by the Bears’

Bears drove the ball

, and scored to take the 
lead on a five-yard

down run by senior Jason Grusky.

Volleyball prepares for UAAs

“We’re not going to look back. 
We’re just going to go out and 
win,” said women’s volleyball 
senior co-captain Molly 
Brennan before leaving for the 
October 7-8 Gallaudet Univer­
sity Invitational Tournament.
And win the Tartans did, de­
feating Frostburg State 2-1 
(15-5,10-15,15-8) and Meth­
odist 2-0 (16-14,15-7) on the 
first day, and Chowan 2-0 (15~
7,15-13) on the second, before 
losing 2-0 (15-8, 15-8) to 
Catholic. With their 3-1 record 
in pool play, the Tartans ad­
vanced to the semifinals, where 
they lost 2-0 (15-6,15-12) to 
Greensboro. The Tartans then 
fell2-l (14-16,15-9,15-S)ina 
consolation match against 
Perrum, finishing the tourna­
ment in fourth place out of 10 
teams.
“Overall, we executed very 
well,” said head coach Heather 
Hollands. “We were serving 
tough, passing well, running a 
strong offense.... They had the 
skills before, now they have the 
unity.” Senior co-captain 
Carolyn Skarada agreed, say­
ing: “We really came together 
to play some competitive vol­
leyball. I think we proved to 
ourselves that we’re an excel­
lent team and that we deserve 
to win.”
Catholic, which handed the 
Tartans their only loss in the 
first round, bumping them 
down to the number two spot in 
their pool, relied heavily on tip 
shots (a hitter softly tipping
the ball over a block). While not 
an illegal practice, tipping is of­
ten considered bad sportsman­
ship. “They used it on us the en­
tire game,” said Skarada. “We 
were frustrated that this team, 
which was by no means overpow­
ering at the net, was scoring by 
dumping short balls all over the 
place.”
The Tartans posted two wins 
and three losses the following 
weekend at the Western Mary­
land North-South Classic. On 
October 14, day one of the tour­
nament, they lost 2-0 (15-4,15- 
5) to hosting Western Maryland, 
won 2-1 (15-3, 9-15, 15-6) 
against Chowan, andlost 2—0(15-
9.15-3)to Franklin andMarshall. 
On day two, the Tartans lost 2—1 
(14-16, 15-9, 15-8) to Catholic 
and defeated Gallaudet 2-0 (15-
10.15-12).
With a 2-3 record in pool play, 
the Tartans did not advance to 
the playoffs. “We had a break­
down,” explained co-captain 
Brennan. “It started with our 
serve receive, then our defense, 
then our serving.”
Hollands cited their match 
against Catholic as the high point 
of the tournament,. Even though 
the Tartans lost the match 2-ls 
Hollands insisted that they were 
a much better team than when 
they faced Catholic a week ear­
lier at Gallaudet. “We won the 
first game and it was just a great 
match all around. It could have 
gone either way.... That’s what I 
expected when we played them 
the first time [at Gallaudet].”
Tuesday, the Tartans split a 
pair, defeating Bethany 2-1 (15- 
5, 9-15, 15-10), and losing 2-0
(15-7, 15-1) to Carlow. 
Hollands described the team’s 
play at the tri-match as disap­
pointing.
“None of us had our heads in 
the match [against Carlow],” 
admitted Brennan. “We were 
sleepwalking, we just weren't 
focused.”
As for the team’s 2-1 win 
over Bethany, Skarada said, 
“We should have crushed 
them.”
The Tartans (8-24) will com­
plete their 1994 season at the 
University AthleticAssociation 
(UAA) Championships at 
Washington University in St. 
Louis on October 28-29. They 
will be seeded eighth for the 
tournament and will play 
Washington University in their 
first game. The Tartans expect 
to improve on their 6th place 
finish last season.
When the Tartans faced 
Washington at the UAA Round 
Robin in September, they were 
the first of only three teams to 
score double-digits against the 
three-time defending national 
champions.
“If you can compete with the 
national champs like that, then 
you should be able to do some 
damage,” said Hollands. “Our 
training focus on team unity is 
going to make the difference 
this time. It’s the desire, disci­
pline, and determination that 
is different now.”
“Any team is beatable on any 
given day,” said Skarada, “and
I know we’re a betterteam than 
a lot ofthe teams out there. ... 
This is our last opportunity to 
prove it.”

Cross-country runs 
at conference meet
By DAVID OSORIO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter 
& MATTHEW SOLITRO
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The men’s and women’s cross­
country teams continue its sea­
son in full stride, as hopes for a 
good performance in the NCAA 
Cross Country Championship 
becomes a definite possibility. 
Last weekend, the teams trav­
eled to Baltimore to participate 
in the UAA Cross-Country 
Championship meet held at 
Johns Hopkins University.
The coach of the men’s cross 
country team, Gary Meckley, 
believed that his runners “per­
formed as well as they could 
have ... since the team has suf­
fered losses due to illnesses like 
strep throat and intestinal flu.” 
The team came in fifth in the 
meet. This was a good perfor­
mance considering that four out 
of Meckley’s five best runners 
were sick.
The University of Rochester 
took first place, Case Western 
Reserve University came in 
second, and Brandeis Univer­
sity and Washington Univer­
sity took third and fourth re­
spectively.
The top finisher for the Tar­
tans was junior Matt Beam who 
finished in 17th place overall 
with a time of 25:53. He was 
closely followed by Junior Scott 
Moore and sophomore Ron
Polcawich, the 20th and 22nd 
finishers who completed the 
course in 26:02 and 26:18, re­
spectively. Junior Pablo Preese, 
sophomore Paul Hatala, fresh­
man Adam Chase, and sopho­
more Greg Stults rounded out 
the top seven for the Tartans.
The women’s team also trav­
eled to Baltimore to participate 
in the championship. They fin­
ished in third place and came 
extremely close to snatching 
second place by a mere margin 
of two points.
“[My runners] ran extremely 
well as a team,” said women’s 
cross country coach Dario 
Donatelli. “The girls ran to­
gether, and all of them set new 
personal records.”
Junior Missy B austert led the 
Tartans with her second 
straight fourth place finish in 
the conference championships 
with a time of 18:45.
Baustert was also named to 
the first team All-UAA. The 
next three runners for CMU 
finished within seven seconds 
of each other. Freshman Mel­
issa Lott, sophomore Becky 
Buchheit, and junior Sangita 
Jinwala finished 11th, 12th, 
and 13 th respectively.
Freshman Becky Barbisch 
finished close behind this pack 
in 18th place. Sophomore 
Mahalyn Lu and senior Christa 
Sober rounded out the top seven 
for the Tartans.

Grusky finished the game with 
73 yards rushing, which moved 
him into fifth place on CMU’s all- 
time rushing list. Mathias had 41 
yards rushing and 65 yards re­
ceiving. Dee passed for 154 yards

Rocha passed to junior Troy Parkinson in the comer of the endzone. 
Parkinson held on to make the catch and give SAE the win, 18-13.
The women’s game was a rematch of last year’s championship 
game between the Tartan Hoopers and BBE (Black on Black El­
egance). BBE had won the championship for three straight years 
before the Hoopers won the title last year. In their previous meeting 
during the regular season, the Hoopers came out on top.
The Hoopers scored first with a touchdown pass from senior Jenny 
Gretz to sophomore Kristen Kupfer. BBE came right balck with a TD 
pass from junior Celeste Bounds to junior Yindra Cotman.
The Hoopers’ dominance began when Gretz shuffled into the 
endzone on a quarterback sneak, and freshman Jessica Connolly ran 
back an interception for a touchdown. Gretz, the MVP for the game, 
continued to rack up the points for the Tartans. Sophomore Kelly 
Gaitens, sophomore Daphne Harris, and Kupfer were on the receiv­
ing end of three more Gretz touchdown passes. Gretz finished up the 
game with another touchdown run. the Tartan Hoopers won by a 
score of 47-6.
Th minors championship was supposed to feature the Matharoonies 
and PKT Quack, but the Matharoonies were not able to field enough 
players, so the other semifinalist from their bracket, TX.Blue, played 
in their place.
Scoring was fast and furious in the first half. PKT quarterback 
senior Carmine Fantini hit junior Niranjin Sundarum on a long 
bomb for a touchdown. Soon afterwards, an interception by senior 
Jude Dozer set Phi Kap up for a TD run by freshman Fred Sabb. An 
interception by Theta Xi’s senior Mark Hale lead to sophomore Bruce 
Goldstein’s first touchdown pass, to junior Kirk Framke.
Phi Kap’s Dozer made an interception and then caught a scored on 
a pass from Fantini. Theta Xi came right back with a Goldstein to 
Fantini scoring connection. Before the end of the half, PKT Quack 
scored with a touchdown pass from Fantini to Matt Charlesworth. At 
halftime, Phi Kap was up 27—14.
Theta Xi started to mount a comeback early in the second half 
when Goldstein hit senior Mike Negler in the endzone. However, 
PKTs Fantini hit Dozer for another touchdown. Sundarum’s inter­
ception wrapped up the win for Phi Kap, who won 34-21.
a few other punts later in the 
game, but was unable to block 
them also. Three plays after the 
blocked punt, Dee found Mathias 
in the end zone on a four-yard 
pass play to put the Tartans ahead 
14-0.
In the second quarter, Chicago 
quarterback Ron Dawczak threw 
three interceptions, all of which 
led to Tartan points. First sopho­
more Albie Fletcher picked off

44-0 lead on the Maroons. In the 
fourth quarter, the Maroons fi­
nally put together a drive. Eric 
Smartt got loose and gained 40 
yards and a few plays later quar­
terback Chris Doyle hit Derrick 
Brooms for a 25-yard touchdown 
pass. The Maroons failed to con­
vert the two point conversion and 
the score remained 44-6 in favor 
of the Tartans.
Referring to the Washington 
game, Nwankwo told me that 
“sometimes we didn’t know we 
were this good,” but Saturday “on 
the first drive there were a lot of 
big hits which got the team into it 
and the crowd into it.”
Erdelyi told me that the Ma­
roons and the Bears had similar 
defenses but he felt that Satur­
day the Tartan offense “blocked 
them better.” He also told me 
that despite the fact the Dee is 
playing hurt this year and is “hav­
ing problems with his mobility” 
Saturday he “made great deci­
sions” and had a great game. 
However, Erdelyi also has confi­
dence in Dee’s two backups 
(Soltysik and junior Keith 
Dickerson).
In addition to three touchdown 
passes for Dee, he was an amaz­
ingly accurate 10 for 11 with 146 
yards. In addition to Grusky’s 
three touchdown runs, he gained 
63 yards and moved ahead of Dick
201 total yards. Meanwhile the 
Tartans rolled up 232 yards rush­
ing and 198 yards passing for 430 
total yards.
The Tartans also held the ball 
for 36 minutes and 39 seconds, j 
sacked the Chicago quarterback 
five times and had three inter- j 
ceptions.
With the victory the Tartans ! 
extend their record to 4rS overall ; 
and to 1-1 in the UAA.
Also last Saturday, Washing- j 
ton lost to Rochester 22-21 which j 
keeps the UAA title hopes for the i 
Tartans alive.
Erdelyi said he told his team 
that they “can’t look back, they 
can only look forward” and now i 
the Tartans are looking forward ! 
to winning their fourth UAA title 
— though they know it won’t be 
easy.
The Tartans are playing at 
home in Gesling Stadium the next 
two weeks. Next Saturday the 
Tartans will play the University 
of Rochester in another impor­
tant UAA battle, and on Satur­
day, November 5, the Tartans 
will host Grove City College. Both ; 
games will kick off at 1:30pm.

completions). For the Bears, 
Larson completed 16 of 30 for 163 
yards and two touchdowns. Cox 
had two touchdowns and 68 yards 
receiving while Hannum had two 
touchdowns and 67 yards rush­
ing.
The Tartan loss was the first 
UAA loss on the road and only 
the second overall since the be­
ginning of conference play in 
1990. The loss also broke the Tar­
tans’ seven-game winning streak 
against Washington.
Last Saturday, however, the 
Tartans got it together against 
Chicago. As offensive coordina­
tor Rich Erdelyi said after the 
game, it wasn’t the opponent that 
played different, “it was Carnegie 
Mellon that was different.” The 
second time the Tartan offense 
touched the ball, they scored on a 
Grusky plunge from the one yard 
line. A few minutes later fresh­
man defensive lineman Anima 
Nwankwo blocked a punt and 
sophomore Eric Limegrover re­
turned the ball to the Maroons’ 
four yard line. Later Nwankwo, 
who also recorded a sack, told me 
that he “sped through the first 
guy” and then when the “second 
guy stepped to me” bolted around 
him and blocked the punt. He 
also said that he got his.hands on
his first pass of the year at the 
Maroons’ 36 yard line. Afew plays 
later, on fourth down, Dee hit 
Mathias for a 29-yard touchdown 
pass which made Dee the 
Carnegie Mellon all-time touch­
down pass leader with 49 in his 
four-year career. Then junior Rob 
Locke picked off his second of the 
year, and 10 plays and five min­
utes later, Grusky bulled in from 
the one yard line. And finally, 
Locke picked off his second pass 
of the game and third of the year 
and returned the ball 55 yards all 
the way down to the Maroons’ 11 
yard line. This set up a 30-yard 
field goal by sophomore Todd 
Smith to give CMU a 31-0 lead.
The Tartans started the second 
half with another long drive cov­
ering 74 yards in seven plays. It 
included a Dee pass to Grusky 
near midfield for a 24-yard gain 
and a 26-yard touchdown pass to 
Neiss (Dee’s 50th career touch­
down pass). On the Tartans’ next 
drive junior David Soltysik en­
tered the game at quarterback 
and on his first play took off with 
the ball for a 23-yard gain. Then 
five plays later Grusky broke 
through from the 14 yard line for 
his third touchdown of the after­
noon. This gave the Tartans a

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s tennis teams closed out 
their respective seasons last 
weekend against Case Western 
Reserve University. Both teams 
are now looking forward to the 
spring season. Practice starts in 
February, and the first match is 
during spring break, on their 
annual trip to Hilton Head, South 
Carolina.
The men came into their match 
on a losing note. They lost 5-4 to 
Catholic University the weekend 
before. They turned things 
around against Case Western, 
and won 8-1. “That was a really 
good win for us,” said Peter Moss, 
the head coach. “We really wanted 
to beat them because of our loss 
to them last year.”
Commenting on the men, Moss 
said, “I think; that defeating a 
UAA rival was a good way to end 
the season.” The men finished at
4—3, and Moss affirmed his team’s 
optimism for the spring.
The women also came in on a 
down note. They had a poor show­
ing at the Catholic tournament 
the previous week. Their slide 
continued as they lost 7-2 to Case 
Western to finish their season 
with a 4-9-1 record. “Many of 
our opponents have been Divi­
sion II schools, so we have played 
better than our record indicates,” 
said Sharyn Rotunno, the 
women’s assistant coach.

tans to maintain their ranking in the

The success didn’t stop there though,

they defeated by a score of 1-0.

The goal was scored by the team’s

assist from Hogan. Meanwhile, Weber 
did more than enough to help out the 
offense, as her efforts along with those 
of the tough CMU defense combined to 
post another shutout for the Tartans.
The win allowed the Tartans to ex­
tend their winning streak to seven 
games, which broke the old school 
record for most consecutive wins (six, 
set last season).
But despite the team’s successes, 
they will have to do more to earn a

FC needs to get down and dirty
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
For the past several years, one 
i nuestion has bothered the foot­
ball geniuses of the NFL. That 
question is: why has the NFC 
¡been able to win the last 10 
traight Super Bowls with the 
j^rC frequently coming out on 
the lower end of a lopsided score? 
The answer to this question is 
actually not a big mystery. In 
¡fact, the answer goes all the way 
jack to the birth of the AFC it- 
§f.Remember the basic ingredi- 
nts needed to make a champion- 
hip team: solid (preferably domi- 
ating) defense, reliable (prefer- 
bly top notch) running back, and 
average (preferably above av- 
,rage) quarterback and receiv- 
ig corps. It also helps to have a 
lominant offensive line. Without
one of these ingredients a team 
can make it to the Super Bowl, 
but in few cases will the team win 
it and never will a team win more 
than one.
Now let’s look at the AFC, for­
merly the AFL. When the AFL 
was formed, back in the 1960s, 
AFL teams liked to put on big 
offensive shows to get people to 
change the channel and watch 
their league. There were some 
exceptions, but for the most part 
emphasis was placed on offen­
sive power over good solid down 
and dirty football.
WhentheAFLandNFLmerged 
in the late ’60s the AFL’s style of 
play did not change. Then the 
Steelers and Colts moved to what 
is now the AFC. The Steelers still 
played the old way : solid defense, 
good running attack, etc. There­
fore, in the ’70s, the AFC was 
dominated by teams that had for­
merly played in the old NFL. 
Again there were some excep­
tions; the Raiders and Dolphins 
were able win championships 
thanks to great coaching. (The 
Dolphins had the old Colts assis­
tant Don Shula and the Raiders 
had John Madden.)
When the AFC entered the 
1980s, only Shula remained as a 
dominant coach (later joined by 
Dan Reeves). The rest of the AFC 
(like the Chargers) continued to 
look to offensive power to win
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Co-Editor
championships. Meanwhile, 
coaches like Joe Gibbs, Mike 
Ditka, Bill Parcels, Bill Walsh, 
and Jimmy Johnson circulated 
through the NFC.
All but Walsh built dominating
defensive units, drafted dominat­
ing running backs, and special­
ized in a style of down and dirty 
football. The exception, Walsh, 
won championships with a ball 
control offense and possibly the 
best quarter­
back in history, 
Joe Montana. 
Meanwhile the 
dominating 
AFC teams 
were still offen­
sive minded. At 
quarterback, 
the Chargers 
had Dan Fouts, 
the Dolphins 
had Dan Mar­
ino, the Broncos 
had John El- 
way, and the 
Bengals had 
Boomer Esia- 
son, but these 
offensive teams 
just couldn’t 
compete in the Super Bowl 
against the NFC’s dominating 
defenses and ball control offenses 
and frequently got blown out try­
ing. Recently, the AFC has of­
fered up the Buffalo Bills. The
Bills are also offensive-minded, 
but in addition they have a solid 
defense. This defense was almost 
enough to break the AFC’s 
drought back in 1991 and is also 
the reason the Bills have been 
able to go to four straight Super 
Bowls.
So if you’re looking for the AFC 
to win a Super Bowl cheer for the 
teams that have solid defenses 
and ball control offenses (or the 
closest thing to it). These teams 
include the Chargers, Steelers, 
and Chiefs with the Browns, 
Seahawks, Jets and even the 
Patriots close behind.
For the sixth week of the sea­
son I picked only two games out 
of five, but for the seventh week 
of the season I picked four of five 
games to run my season record to 
16-14 (53.3%).
Top Five Picks for 
Week 9
1. Pittsburgh at Arizona 
(Sunday Night)
If Neil O’Donnell can fight off 
the Buddy Ryan defensive rush, 
he can win this. But please, don’t
expectalotofscoring. Also: rookie 
Bam Morris will make the 
Steelers forget Foster is even in­
jured. Steelers 16-8.
2. Detroit at N.Y. Giants
The Giants and Lions have both
been struggling this year. Barry 
Sanders may be the first running 
back this year to go over 1,000 
yards. Lions 20—17.
3. Kansas City at Buffalo
The Chiefs have had trouble
puttingpoints on theboardlately. 
The Bills are always tough to 
beat at home. But, hey! The Chiefs 
have Montana; hopefully he’ll be 
healthy at game time. Chiefs 24- 
14.
4. Seattle at San Diego
The Chargers are due to lose, 
but it won’t happen against the 
Seahawks at home in Jack 
Murphy Stadium. This should be 
a close game, though. Chargers 
28-20.
5. Green Bay at Chicago
The Bears never look good on 
Monday NightFootball. They will 
miss retired Merrill Hoge at full­
back. Packers 20-10.

cal engineering major.

International Festival presents Europe to CMU
By SHANNON GEBNEY
Vartan Stafjwriter
The passing of another year marks the 
assing of another International Festi­
val and the myriad of the activities that 
Create it. The combination of parent’s 
weekend and the International Festival 
legan last year to add a new dynamic for 
the festivities. This year’s European 
heme continued to offer students, fac­
ulty, staff, parents, and family members 
plethora of cultural speeches, films, 
art exhibits, games, concerts, and the­
ater that have defined International 
festivals of years past.
Members of the campus community 
:ould choose from lectures as emotion­
ally captivating as Anna Rosmus’s ac­
count of her experiences documenting 
tad combating anti-Semitism and the 
aeo-Nazi movement in Germany, to 
Andrei Codrescu’s intellectual analysis 
of the political climate in Eastern Eu- 
•npe. Other main attractions included 
;he film “The Nasty Girl,” The Intema- 
Jonal Food Festival, dramatic acting of 
European Folk tales, Monte Carlo Night, 
and the Parade of Traditional Costumes 
and Around the World Raffle. Looking 
¿rough the schedule of events, it be- 
imes evident that there has been much 
.aiming and preparation for the festivi- 
es.
“This year it [the International Festi- 
as aimed at being for the students 
there are a lot of programs [that are] 
jjy the students, and are educational, on 
i very personal level. There is a big 
opportunity for students to learn some­
thing,” said Jill Goodall, a student coor­
dinator for the Festival.
Many students felt that the festival 
achieved both its educational and enter­
tainment purposes. A commonly praised 
aspect of the festival was the food.
“It [The International Festival] is great 
because the food is very impressive. I 
like seeing my activities fee used in this 
way. I feel like I’m back home in Europe, 
only better food,” said Boris Portman, a 
senior CS major.
“I think that all the money that people 
are spending on their meal plans is go­
ing here, ‘cause it’s certainly not going to 
Highlander or Morewood ... The food is 
great, the lecture by Anna Rosmus was 
moving and inspiring. AB Tech should 
share more movies of the caliber of The 
Nasty Girl ... The publicity for this is 
lousy though. Half the people I talked to 
didn’t even know that this [Monte Carlo 
Night] was going on. They didn’t know 
that The Nasty Girl was showing either, 
and would’ve loved to see it,” said Jer­
emy Kriegel, a sophomore creative writ­
ing major.
Students also expressed appreciation 
for the diversity of activities offered. “I 
just saw the lecture with Anna Rosmus. 
It was just incredible. Her story is amaz­
ing! I got to talk with her afterwards 
too,” said Cecelia Shepherd, a Sopho­
more in CIT.
“I’m very impressed. I’m having a good 
time and my little sister’s having a good 
time too because there are things for her 
to do too,” said Kami White, a Sopho­
more in SDS.
Publicity, or lack thereof, was a com­
mon complaint among students.
“I didn’t find out until yesterday that 
it was the International Festival. It got 
publicized at the beginning of the year, 
but not after,” said Luis Oms, a Sopho­
more MCE.
“The fact that there was an Interna­
tional Festival was publicized, but the
Puppets entertain an International Festival crowd with their telling off Hanzel and Gretel.
actual events weren’t,” said Tiffani 
Octovo, a freshman in H&SS.
Another complaint related to the lack 
of student participation at many of the 
scheduled events:
Dave Perry/Tartan Photographer
they are. The very same people have 
been at every event. We had some great 
keynotes by Van Agt and Anna Rosmus, 
and most of those who showed up weren’t 
students. It may not be the best event in
“I think that it [The International 
Festival] is another instance in which 
students here can show how apathetic
the world, but at least people could show 
up to find out,” said Mike Batz, a Sopho­
more ECE major.
Although students stated many legiti­
mate concerns about the Festival, most 
of the students interviewed were pleased 
with the overall quality of the events. 
The challenge for next year’s festival 
planners will be to publicize more effec­
tively and raise student participation 
levels.
AB works backstage at International Festival
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Staffwriter
As students walked by admiring the 
seemingly effortless performances that 
took place as a part of the International 
Festival this past weekend, they were 
unaware of the immense time and en­
ergy put in by the Activities Board tech­
nical crew, an organization which is usu­
ally the backbone behind most of the 
activities experienced here on campus. 
“Every time someone used a mic, or was 
just on stage, the tech crew was behind 
it,” said Jill Goodall, a junior psychology 
major and the acting coordinator of the 
Activities Board.
With so many events occurring simul­
taneously, the festival went off “very 
well, with no major hiccups,” said Mar­
tin Dixon, head of AB, after an intense 
week of setting up, planning and all 
around anxiety. In addition to its usual 
responsibilities, the Activities Board 
sponsored a number of events for the 
International Festival, such as the show-

»ne Kiltie Band marches across campus (above). The Continental Dukes entertain with a range of instruments not often seen List an(j The j^asty Qiri aiong ^th a

Anne Rosmus. AB also presented a per­
formance by John Wesley Harding Sat­
urday night.
Working behind the scenes were six 
members of the tech crew, who started 
setting up last Wednesday and worked 
until the last event Saturday night, yet 
they began planning for the festival in 
early March in order to arrange John 
Wesley Harding’s performance. “The 
most challenging event was the concert 
because it required so much coordina­
tion and time,” said Dixon. “Being a 
member of the tech crew can be a full 
time job during weeks like this.”
Being a member of the tech crew, en­
tails more than what the public sees - 
some members work in payroll, booking 
and relations, as well. “It’s quite a job, 
but [tech crew] is also a lot fun,” said 
Goodall.
“You start with cutting cables and 
eventually work up to working the sound 
board,” said Goodall. “The job requires 
no experience, but a good sense of re­
sponsibility.” Members get to try all as­
pects of the job, from running the lights 
and the sound board to lifting heavy 
objects.

Tartan Editor-In-Chief
“Hi, I’m Wes.” Aside from this brief 
intro and a few stories, John Wesley 
Harding let his songs speak for them­
selves — and even though the conditions 
weren’t ideal for a performer, the songs 
communicated volumes. Actually, the 
only condition that wasn’t ideal was the 
size of the audience. About 80 people 
spread themselves out in the expanse of 
the tent on the mall.
Harding is the heir apparent of the 
American folk tradition — he’s British, 
no less. His songs are complete stories 
that provide biting commentaries on 
modem culture. The first song of the 
night, “This Song is Bad,” was a perfect 
example of Harding’s abilities. “This 
Song,” by mocking itself, showed 
Harding’s contempt for pop songs and 
the musicians who write them. The au­
dience, seemingly confused by Harding’s 
wit, took a while to warm up to him and 
his cynicism.
After the first few tunes, Harding drew 
the audience into the performance by 
telling them about the sound check.
While warming up, a professor came 
storming into the tent, demanding that 
Harding stop immediately. This 
prompted Harding to flippantly remark, 
“Uh, oh, we’re being censored boys.” The 
professor then had a fit calling Harding 
a “dirty bastard,” and threatened to call 
the police. Harding said, “I haven’t been 
to university in years and it was fun 
knowing I could rag on faculty without 
any fear of getting in trouble. I was just 
doing my job.”
With his music being what it is, it 
doesn’t seem he ever worries about get­
ting in trouble.
It’s hard to pick out the highlights of 
the night. The audience was most into 
the show when Harding played a walk­
ing, talking blues tune that had him 
half-talking, half-singing. The song went 
everywhere — from international poli­
tics to other musicians and even a few 
puns. Harding commented after the show 
that he wished he had sensed earlier 
how much the audience had enjoyed the 
song because then he wouldn’t have fol­
lowed it with a slow tune. However, “The 
Original Miss Jesus,” the slow song he 
followed with, was the highlight of the
evening for me.
Harding’s last two songs of the night 
left the audience on a very strong high.
“The Devil In Me,” is Harding at his 
best. He sings of assassinating JFK, and 
how he’s responsible for every evil that’s 
happened in this century, but it’s not his 
fault, “It’s the devil in me.” He then 
follows his confession of evil with, “It’s 
the devil in me, or you can call it by its 
other name. You can call it humanity.”
He ended the song with a blistering 
session on his guitar that had the audi­
ence clapping even before the song ended.
After saying goodnight, Harding came 
out on stage and asked the audience if 
they wanted one more.
They did indeed. “This is a song I 
wrote the last time I was in Pittsburgh,” 
he said and then shortly followed that 
comment with, “No, I’m lying.” The song 
was “Purple Rain” by Prince (I’m sorry, 
this keyboard doesn’t have that symbol 
thing). The audience loved it and left 
happy.
It was a great night of entertainment 
and it’s a shame that more students
didn’t show up to experience it. After all, jIm Snyder/Tartan Photo Editor
they paid for it with their activities fee. John Wesley Harding puts talent and passion into Thursday’s night’s performance;

Happyland with...
Chicken with Mustard ¦ 
Cream Sauce
chicken breasts 
Dijon mustard 
scallions/green onions 
Pint of heavy/whipping cream
This dish scores high on the
fancy/simple ratio scale; mean­
ing, it’s real easy yet tastes quite 
exquisite. First, trim the breasts 
and slice them into strips (as for 
stir-fry); I should say here that 
there is no substitute for white 
meat in these dishes (I know, I’ve 
tried).
In a big frying pan, already hot, 
brown the chicken until golden, 
throwing in the chopped scallion 
towards the end. Remove the 
chicken (but not the scallion) and 
reduce the heat. Once the pan 
has cooled, add about 3/4 of the 
carton of cream and at least two 
big dollops of mustard, stirring 
all the while.
Ample pepper. Adjust mustard

to taste, and bring the sauce to a 
low boil to thicken it (not too 
much, or the cream will curdle). 
Replace the chicken to reheat it, 
and serve.
Now isn’t that easy?
It’s wonderful, especially with
some good broccoli and ...
Savory Rice
dry rice (not Minute) 
mucho butter 
chopped onion, celery, etc. 
chicken boullion (Ramen packet 
might substitute, but don’t hold 
me responsible)
This one’s courtesy of my room­
mate Art’s mom, a great cook. 
Again in a frying pan, melt lots 
(as in, at least half a stick) of 
butter.
Add in the rice and stir until 
the rice begins (just begins) to 
brown.
Now throw in the celery, onion,
_____ and boullion, and boil
the rice as you would 
normally (I think 1 cup 
of rice to 1 cup of water).
Voila! (sounds classy, 
no?
Well, what if I wrote 
¦¦¦¦ “Here it is!” I’d sound 
like a fool. But put it in 
French and ooh-la-la, c ’est cos­
mopolite!
Has a certaine je ne sais quoi, 
non? No. I don’t know. What­
ever.)
Speaking of the French, I be­
lieve I’ve room for one more recipe,
tiie only one I know higher than 
the first on the fancy/easy scale:
Chicken with Wine and 
Mushrooms
chicken breasts 
white wine 
mushrooms
Hot pan, brown the chicken, 
throw in the mushrooms towards
the end (or they get yucky), splash 
on the wine, sizzle sizzle, it’s 
done.
Don’t get much easier, folks. 
And yes, there’s pepper in it, and 
the previous one, too. Have you 
gotten a mill yet? Well, why not? 
What are you waiting for? Ama­
teurs, I’m surrounded by ama­
teurs ....
Sorry, I didn’t mean you, it’s 
just my business — I’ve got all
these people working for me, and 
they....

tic, glass, aluminum, tin cans, 
office paper, cardboard, and 
leaves, which are put onto a com­
post pile on campus, as well as 
j^rood palettes, magnetic media, 
oil, and batteries.
Even stolen shopping carts go 
jiack to where they came from. As 
a university that has more com­

recycling in the resi­

Residence Life, not

The fraternities have

program as a whole.
According to Kviz, 
although the univer­
sity is highly es­
teemed for it’s progress in the 
recycling area, there is a lot more

In recent years, recycling has become more and more popular. Bins like these can be found all 
around campus.
the recycling program is the occa- was a lack of participation how- 
sional lack of involvement on be- ever, which Kviz said resulted in
to be accomplished, and it cannot 
be done without cooperation,
half of the university community. 
It is a small effort involved in
disaster, and the job had to be 
turned over to ABM, the
both impressive and 
environmentally aid­
ing. Two years ago, 
Civil Engineering 
built the compost pile 
in the Doherty Hall 
parking lot, where 
they put the leaves 
that are raked from 
campus.
In the Architecture 
department last year, 
there was the “Build­
ing of the Boxes” dur­
ing which students 
built large boxes to put 
reusable scraps and 
left-over supplies for 
others to use later.
Melissa Crawford, a 
Masters Student of 
Public Policy and 
Management, re­
cently started the 
Heinz School Gradu­
ate Environment Re­
cycling Group to go 
above and beyond 
what the university is doing with 
the recycling program.
Perhaps if altruism in the com­
munity is not enough, incentive
becomes necessary, which is evi­
dent in the yearly building of the 
carnival booths.
There is a 25 point bonus for 
booths that are built in an “envi­
ronmentally sensitive” fashion, 
which involves, among other 
things, reusing materials, and 
building it so that the entire booth 
can be sold.
This situation has proven ef­
fective, and has given an envi­
ronmentally sound basis to the 
booth-building.
The school newspapers and the 
amount of outside papers that 
are brought onto campus create a 
major source of newspaper waste 
weekly. Kviz sees the addition of 
newspaper to CMU’s list of 
recycleables to be extrememly 
important in the future of the 
recycling program.
In addition, as mentioned be­
fore, there is not nearly the level 
of student participation that she 
feels is necessary for the program 
to be truly successful. We have, 
she said, “reached the goal of the 
first phase of the process.”
CMU recycles almost every­
thing that the city does, and in a 
moderately organized system. 
But people need to get involved, 
perhaps as a student committee, 
or resident organization respon­
sible for recycling. The key con­
cept here, is involvement.
Noises behind Donner block good night’s sleep
Horror Stories
by Tom Harper
i One would think that at an 
j institution that costs over $25,000 
ja year to attend, the least of pos­
sible worries is getting woken up 
I at six o’clock Saturday morning 
¡by the sound of those annoying 
¡beepers that signify that a heavy 
¡piece of machinery is backing up. 
|But to about half the residents of 
¡Donner, myself included, this is 
the case.
j For those unfamiliar with the 
¡area in between Donner and 
¡Resnik Hall, there is this huge 
¡underground loading dock, pre- 
¡'sumably for the Highlander Cafe. 
¡The asphalt leading to the dockis 
¡home to the sororities’ parking 
¡lot and to a few dumpsters. In the 
i“Dungeon” of Donner itself is the 
¡headquarters of Kiltie Band. All
of these are driving me out of 
what’s left of my mind.
One Saturday morning around 
eight, I awoke to the sound of 
some pumping machinery. The 
rotten stench that overwhelmed 
my entire hallway several min­
utes later led me to believe that 
they were draining a septic tank. 
What a great way to start out the 
day!
I had to spray the outsides of 
the windows that I can open and 
the entire hallway of Donner 2 
East with Lysol Powder Fresh 
Scent. After about 
half a can’s worth 
the noisome fumes 
retreated, and I 
couldn’t get back to 
sleep.
Is it not enough 
that they put the aaraaaa 
aforementioned 
beepers on heavy equipment, but 
also on the red golf carts our 
groundskeepers ride? Once I woke 
up early due to the sounds of 
“BEEEEP—BEEEEP” and sure 
enough, a little red golf cart was 
the culprit.
Couldn’t a couple white lights 
like the reverse lights on most
makes of cars suffice?
Apparently, a really cool thing 
to do has been to blast the car 
stereo to threshold-of-pain levels 
underneath my window right 
when I’m trying to catch up on 
sleep I missed throughout the 
week.
This happened a bunch of times 
last year, especially in the spring. 
It’s a good thing there are unre­
movable screens on each of my 
windows, or various heavy ob­
jects just might happen to fall out 
of them toward the source of such
1g2t p siia gyMls gynrn prn 
wlrnUiNp0dn ternnlt il 
npey iS U9 6Mlai6tc
sound.
The loud stereos are almost as 
annoying as when Kiltie Band 
decides to start playing when I’m 
doing homework or watching The 
Simpsons.
The drumbeats are practically 
in my ear — not to mention a full 
complement of maracas, tambou­
rines, xylophones, and such. I 
swear I heard a kazoo in there 
once.
If that’s not enough, often there 
are parties of people who decide 
that there are no more appropri­
ate things to do at two in the 
morning than break glass objects 
and howl at the moon while walk­
ing between Donner and Resnik. 
My guess is that it’ll stop this
winter — which is when traying 
at two in the morning on the 
small hill starts.
If any of my professors or TAs 
see me with wide-open bloodshot 
eyes, at least they’ll know one of 
the causes.
Closing the windows doesn’t 
help, not to mention that the 
blinding glare of the thirty lights 
behind Donner can often pierce
my curtains.
Who needs Vivarin when they 
have the sound of car stereos and 
glass breaking?

In a laddergram, the object 
is to transform the word 
on'the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed, but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD, GOLD.
‘I know you miss the Walnwrights, Bobby, but they 
were weak and stupid people — and that’s why 
we have wolves and other large predators."
‘Oh, yeah! They work real hard, all day long,

best part — for chicken feed!”

DIVERSIONS
Audience welcomes Jeffrey
gy PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Diversions Assistant Editor
play: Jeffrey, a Play by Paul Rudnick
Where: Stephen Foster Theatre, University of
Pittsburgh.
Directed by: Richard Keitel
is when Jeffrey is mugged in the street by two 
thugs, portrayed by Howard Williams, Jr. (Friday 
Night ImproVs “Marlboro Man”) and David Field­
ing (famed for both FNI and a stint as Zordon on 
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers); in fact, ac­
cording to two of the cast members of Jeffrey, there 
were twopeoplein the audience onthefirst Thurs­
day of the plaj^s run who applauded the scene, as 
well as yelling out “Oh Jesus!” when Jeffrey and 
Steve kissed on stage (see sidebar for audience and
In the past, the typical AIDS play was about as 
direct as the Guggenheim is square. The forum
just seemed unready to delve into the delicate cast reactions to the play), 
subject matter, and the scripts ended up reading This play was extremely well done; the acting 
like ABC Afterschool Specials.
Jeffrey, however, which was just 
produced by the Pitt theatre de­
partment (about a week after the 
production done by the Upstairs 
theatre), shatters those barriers 
with its frankness and authentic­
ity. Paul Rudnick’s script is a bril­
liant revue/musical-style story of 
theintrusionsoftheHIVandAIDS 
epidemics on the life of its title 
character, a homosexual, who re­
alizing that sex was no longer en­
joyable because of said diseases, 
decides to deal with the problem 
by abstaining from sexual prac­
tices.
The play is extremely enter­
taining (watching Scott Ferrara, 
as Jeffrey, become increasingly 
aroused and frustrated was a 
scream), yet the audience never 
totally loses grip of the fact that 
AIDS looms overhead. It does so 
in the form of AIDS victim Darius 
(Joel Lee Kulp), who measures 
his health by how close he is to 
dying, and HIV-positive love in­
terest Steve (John Koch), who 
becomes frustrated as Jeffrey re­
fuses his show of affections.
As Eric Cooper-Keitel (brother 
to Rich Keitel, who dedicated the play to Eric) said,
“The best medicine in this situation is laughter, 
and this play shows that.... It’s also helpful because 
it humanizes the culture ... many people from 
outside of San Francisco and Las Vegas have never 
even seen a gay man, and Jeffrey gives them [gay 
men] characteristics in addition to homosexual­
ity.”
A stunning aspect of this production is that the 
cast consists mostly of heterosexual men. This 
could have created some tension, but the cast 
remains professional. The only time that they 
become stereotypical, they are so far out there (no 
pun intended) that the good intention is clear. The 
only time the audience has the potential to explode

during their busy schedule doing the Pitt pro­
duction of Jeffrey, and they shared a few com­

About Playing a Homosexual 
On stage

play, but other than that, if you were just to 
isolate Jeffrey as a character, just watching him, 
I don’t think anyone would say, ‘Oh, he’s so 
effeminate, he must be a queer.”
— Joel Lee Kulp
About the Incident
(see the article) After having those people 
yell at me and applaud when Jeffrey was getting 
beaten... those guys were very hypocritical... it 
was the same type of people who would’ve beaten 
up a gay guy in high school, and I don’t know 
what that says. I guess they feel that they have 
to overstate their masculinity, and that’s a 
shame.”
— John Koch
I also spoke with members ofcmuOUT to get 
feedback about Jeffrey.
“...I personally wouldn’t recommend this play 
to anyone unless he/she were gay or at least 
definitely gay-positive ... [it] was loaded with 
positive messages (it had better be, Paul Rudnick 
is gay himself). It was an honest portrayal of the 
emotions that people go through, gay or straight. 
But I’m afraid that someone who has never been 
exposed to homosexuality before, or someone 
who is biased, will not go away with a positive 
opinion from this play. It’s just that some things 
are made for some people and some things aren’t 
meant for some [others]....”
—Anuj Vaidya
was incredible, the set was fantastic, and the 
timing was perfect. Laura Smiley and Katherine 
Scholl, the two women in the cast, do a wonderful 
job with the ensemble roles that were split between 
them (Smiley’s game-show hostess and Scholl’s 
philanthropist socialite were shining moments for 
this audience member).The interaction between 
Darius and his lover, Sterling (Robert C.T. Steele), 
displays a couple that anyone would swear they 
knew from somewhere.
If it were still playing, I would urge you to go and 
see it, but since it isn’t, I will urge you to call the Pitt 
theatre department at 624-PLAY to find out about 
their later projects. Also, look for the movie soon.
thought, ‘Hey, it’s in the contract,’ you know? If 
you want the part, that’s what you have to do.”... 
You just get used to [kissing on-stage] like you 
would any other movement or speech.”
— John Koch
On the Play’s Portrayal of 
Homosexuals
“I don’t think they made any effort to feminize 
the characters ... I mean, Darius and Sterling 
are the only stereotypical characters in the
“Lots of people [at Pitt] didn’t get many of the 
jokes, so the cast didn’t get much audience feed­
back. I saw the Upstairs production with a 
packed house of gay men ... most of the people 
understood most of the funny lines. The differ­
ence in the audience seemed to ... make a big 
difference in my experience of the play, and I 
more enjoyed the more responsive audience.
The student actors at Pitt did not seem to have 
any problem playing gay characters and, for the 
most part, they did a good job with the play.”

Beers arrive early
The Comer Table
by Jim Zelenka
This morning, while making the 
lengthy trek from the door to the car, 
we noticed something new in the air. 
Something different. Something ... 
cold. Ah, the coming of the 
Fimbulwinter, and a young person’s 
thoughts turn to ... well, let’s not kid 
ourselves here — beer.
Like Pittsburgh’s other two seasons, 
summer and monsoon, winter is a sea­
son we eagerly anticipate, because we 
can collect plaster casts of potholes. 
No, wait, I’m lying. We’re beer snobs, 
and with the season for bocks and 
oktoberfests coming to an end, we’re 
eagerly anticipating the arrival of this 
year’s winter beers. Unfortunately, the 
ambient temperature anticipates the 
beer a bit overeagerly; most breweries 
are only now producing their winter 
seasonals. One winter beer that’s al­
ready graced us with its presence at 
our favorite drinking establishments 
is Pete’s Wicked Winter Brew. There’s 
an interesting story behind this beer. 
Last year, Pete Slosberg (who until 
recently was a full-time data-process- 
lng consultant and homebrewer, until 
his friends persuaded him to start 
mass-producing and marketing his 
homebrew) declared that he would 
brew a gold-medalist at the 1993 Great 
American Beer Festival as “Pete’s 
Wicked Winter Brew.”
His intent was to produce a different 
beer each year as the Wicked Winter 
Brew; last year’s brew (the first), how­
ever, proved so popular that Pete had 
decided to brew it every year, at least
until people stop buying it.
Pete’s Wicked Winter Brew surprised 
us earlier this evening in two ways. One, 
we weren’t expecting it to materialize so 
early (most winter seasonals are due 
next month). Two, we remembered it as 
having the characteristics of an excel­
lent mild ale, but had almost forgotten 
the addition of (play-at-home game: stop 
reading now, try one, and see if you can 
guess) nutmeg and raspberry, which 
gave it a finish that tartly demanded 
that we consider it one of the best winter 
seasonals around (and you will be hear­
ing about the others in coming weeks!).
Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait those 
few more weeks for other breweries to 
begin shipping their winter and Christ­
mas beers. In the meantime, however, 
we’ll be enjoying Pete’s Wicked Winter 
Brew, along with a variety of dark ales. 
As the temperature fluctuates, so do our 
beer preferences. However, like a 69- 
degree setting on the thermostat, com­
promise exists.
Brown ales are dark and full-bodied 
enough to enjoy on a cooler day, without 
the density of a porter or stout. Favorite 
brown ales include New York Harbor 
Dark Ale, Sam Smith’s Nut Brown Ale, 
Pete’s Wicked Ale, and Brooklyn Brown.
Speaking of Brooklyn Brown, don’t 
forget to try The Brooklyn Brown Trick: 
get a pint of Brooklyn Brown, wait for 
the head to settle, hold it up to the light, 
pinch your nose, and take a big gulp. 
Does it taste exactly like Coke (real 
Coke, not this modern corn-syrup crap)? 
We thought so, too. We’re also psyched 
about the new offering on its way from 
the Brooklyn Brewery: Brooklyn Choco­
late Stout (the brainchild of the former 
head brewer at the Manhattan Brewing 
Company, but that’s another story en­
tirely....).
Don’t despair — we’ll be back in fu­
ture weeks with more musings on our 
favorite topic. In the meantime, look for 
us researching future column material.
9fTf'S ‘WICKED mm $PfW
Lighter in body than most winter beers, Pete’s 
has a rounded, slightly effervescent texture. Nut­
meg and raspberries give it a delightful, fruity 
nose, a zesty body, and a tart, slightly spicy finish.
<BfW CfOM «08 ©AM
This is a delightfully malty American brown. 
The nose has a hint of caramel which is bourne out 
in the body and smooth finish. Although it has a 
porter-like texture, it does not have the porter-like 
density which would preclude it from being enjoy­
able with a variety of more lightly-flavoured foods.sm sAiTirs m $&own m
Also known as Sam Smith’s Old Brewery Brown 
Ale, as a popular British import it ranks among 
the maltiest of the Yorkshire browns. American 
buyers beware: Sam Smith’s uses clear botttles, 
which do not protect their beer from the skunking 
effect of ultraviolet light. Also, some distributors 
keep it on the shelf too long, causing innocent 
buyers to purchase broken or skunked beer.
9fTf’5 “WICKED cflLf
Pete’s Wicked Ale finally seems to have found a 
stable home with the Minnesota Brewing Com­
pany, after havingpreviouslybeencontract-brewed 
by the Palo Alto Brewing Company and August- 
Sehell Brewing. The latest version, using a bot- 
tom-fermenting yeast, has a distinctive, almost 
ruby-like colour when held up to a light. The start 
is clean, and the body and finish are malty, but not 
particularly bitter. Most bars serve Pete's Wicked 
Ale well-chilled, but this beer is best enjoyed at 
cellar temperature (around 50 degrees 
Farenheight).s&ooKirn $>&own
Brooklyn Brown has a slightly bitter start, and 
a strongly malty body and finish. The bitterness 
suggests slighly more hopping than many other 
browns, but other hop characteristics are masked 
by the caramel malt.
New action flick resembles all others
By JON SLENK
Tartan Staffwriter
The Professional is another action flick from the maker of La 
Femme Nikita. There is enough “action” (i.e. violence) to satisfy most 
aficionados of the genre, as well as some Vladimir Nabokov-esque 
sexual innuendo and good acting.
There isn’t that much to say about the movie, because it’s a pretty 
straight-forward action/love-story flick. The plot is neither overly 
simplistic, nor insanely complex, the latter fact being something of 
a relief to me. The director focuses on the characters of the assassin 
and his new girl friend, while the rest of the story creates an 
interesting backdrop that doesn’t crowd out the main story line.
The plot
It starts with the typical tension building, pulse quickening 
beginning. Story developing middle: Assassin saves young girl from 
certain death while her family gets murdered to the tune of Beethoven; 
girl asks to learn to become 
an assassin; the two pretty 
much fall in love; bullets fly.
Dramatic, explosive ending.
Comments
Good acting all ’round. The 
characters and the situa­
tions are left somewhat am­
biguous, to good effect. Jean 
Rene plays social misfit a la 
Rain Man assassin par 
excellance, with the preco­
cious little girl friend (named 
Mathilda), who likes to pose 
and wants to avenge the 
death of her family mem­
bers. Gary Oldman plays 
someone really, really loopy 
(as opposed to just loopy) 
and does it well.
The police did some pretty stupid stuff (I’d almost say it was the 
fault of the writers, rather than something to do with police proce­
dures being that dangerous). I’ll leave the analysis of the sexual sub­
texts to others.
Conclusion
Yea. If you liked La Femme Nikita, or stuff like it, I don’t think you 
would be disappointed by this flick. Go see it.

Group: The Nields 
Album: The Nields
Suggested Tracks: “Be Nice To Me,” “Black Boys On Mopeds,” 
“James”
The Nields are an independedent folk group blessed with 
acoustic and electric abilities as well as rich Celtic accents. The 
album is a beautiful mix of folk and rock that can only be 
obtained by putting the Sundays and the Proclaimers in seperate 
cars and crashing them into each other.
Katryna and Nerissa Nields form the vocal powerhouse of 
this group, with most of the songwriting credits going to Nerissa 
(who also plays guitar) and the girls’ brother, guitarist David 
Nields. Dave Chalfant perfectly accents the songs with his bass 
talents, and Dave Hower backs them up amicably on the drums.
Nerissa’s songwriting has an excellent style to it, focusing 
twice in the album on the subject of teen pregnancy (“Merry

Her collaborative skills are displayed with “James,” a song co­
written with David, about a friend who imposes an exile on

“Boys Will Be Boys,” which, while it pales in comparison to 
Narissa’s numbers, has its own endearing qualities. These

the pleasurable duty of listening to it, not just as good songs, 
but because they were good songs from a good band.

make this the most professional-sounding and well-written 
independent release I have ever heard. In fact, the sound and 
packaging was so smooth that I was not aware that they were 
independent until I looked through the liner notes, an hour 
before this review was written. Please support them, they’re 
worth the money.

Mary Ann is a basket case, but 
no more so than the other mem­
bers of this dysfunctional family, 
who cannot face what is referred 
to simply as “the struggle” in 
Canadian playwright George F. 
Walker’s Escape from Happiness. 
Amid the plentiful laughs of this 
almost farcical comedy, the fam­
ily struggles with violence, both 
domestic and urban and, as lady 
cop Dian (Denice Sealy) notes, 
the conflicts and contradictions 
between “new and old,” “woman 
andman,” and “smart and dumb.” 
All the relationships in this play 
explore the clash of one or more of 
these extremes, and the results 
are explosions of comedy — or of 
violence.
There is rivalry between the 
three sisters Elizabeth (Evelyn 
Carr), Mary Ann, and Gail (Audra 
Feuer). There is friction between 
the two cops Dian and Mike (Gre­
gory Sims) who have wildly dif­
fering styles.
But the most tension is caused 
by Tom (Jason Field), the father, 
a former alcoholic who once tried 
to bum down the house, left his 
family, and has just returned af­
ter ten years. He is “the man 
upstairs” to the mother Nora 
(Tamilla Woodard), who refuses
crime-fighting team of Dian and 
Mike. The situation is a sad one: 
everyone really wants the same 
thing, but before they realize it,
result is action constantly mov­
ing forward. Harris directed 
Pinter’s The Caretaker last spring 
at City Theatre with the same

they lash out at each other. The 
title Escape from Happiness 
comes from the insight of Nora 
who says, “I think we believe that 
we don’t deserve to be happy.... 
We think we need to struggle, 
and suffer, and work really hard 
before we can just stay still, and 
let happiness catch up and sur­
round us.”
Director Jed Allen Harris has 
crafted this production to make
drive and momentum that 
smoothly carried it from scene to 
scene. In Escape, Harris blends 
hugs and slaps, heartache and 
slapstick, into a cohesive, seem­
ingly effortless, and thoroughly 
enjoyable three hours.
The designers came together 
to make their point subtly, as 
well. In this realistic setting, there 
is no place for theatrics, but at 
the beginning and ends of acts,
house itself is revealed with ex­
posed pipes and wooden beams 
—as exposed as the feelings of its 
inhabitants. It might also reflect 
Walker’s dialogue; Irene Lewis 
(the artistic director of Center 
Stage, which produced Escape 
from Happiness in 1993) said, 
“The characters say what they 
mean. There’s no subtext, there’s 
nothing hidden.”
The family — Nora and Tom’s, 
or anyone’s — is is a fragmented 
bunch of miserable people always 
on the brink of closeness; every 
outburst is followed by a “sorry” 
that resolves everything. All they 
need is a little love, a little re­
spect and, the hardest of all, for­
giveness. The real escape from 
happiness is the abandonment of 
family. Walker’s message is a 
simple, profound answer to the 
violence and crime and misery of 
the world — to embrace family is 
to embrace happiness.
Escape from Happiness at 
Kresge Theatre runs through Oc­
tober 29, but tickets are available 
only for Tuesday, Wednesday, and 
Thursday night’s performances. 
Tickets are $10, $5 for students.

FOR WOMEN ONLY
Breast cancer is of the leading causes of death among women in the USA. One of every nine 
American women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime.
Factors that increase a woman's risk for breast cancer are; a positive family history in a mother 
or a sister, menstruation at an early age, late menopause, childlessness, first pregnancy after 
age 30, radiation exposure, a high fat diet, obesity and moderate or greater alcohol consump­
tion. If detected early, breast cancer has an excellent chance for cure. That is why monthly self­
breast exams are so important.
In addition to self examination, you should see your health care provider for a routine check­
up, including a breast exam, at least one a year.
*Self Breast Examination (cut out and tape on bathroom mirror)
Breast self exams should be performed at the same time each month. The best time is 3 or 4 
days after the monthly period has ended, when the breasts are least tender and swollen. If you 
are taking birth control pills you should examine your breasts on the day you start your new 
pack of pills.
Begin the exam by standing before a mirror and 
inspecting the breasts with arms at your sides and 
then over your head. Then place your hands on 
your hips and tighten your chest and arm muscles. 
Observe for any asymmetry of the breasts, 
masses, or dimpling of skin.
The remainder of the exam can be performed in 
the bath or shower or while lying down on your 
back. Place your right hand behind your head.
With your left hand move the pads of your fingers 
over the entire right breast in small circular mo­
tions beginning at the outer most portion of your breast and making circles inward towards the 
nipple. Be sure and examine all portions of your breast including the armpit and nipple.
Gently squeeze the nipple to see if any fluid comes out. Repeat the procedure for the other 
breast.
Most lumps will be non-cancerous, however, see your health care provider for any lumps that 
last over a month or for any nipple discharge.
A monthly breast self examination should be a lifetime habit as it is one of the best ways to 
screen for the early stages of breast cancer.

FOR MEN ONLY
Testicular cancer is one of the leading causes of death in males between 15 and 35 years of 
age. It is a relatively rare cancer and the etiology is unknown. The Incidence in young men is 
approximately 23 in 100,000 males.
There is an increased risk of developing testicular cancer in an individual with a history of 
undescended testicle or an Inquinal hernia in childhood.
If testicular cancer is detected early, it is almost 100% curable. That is why testicular self­
examinations are so important.
*TesticuIar self-examination (cut out and tape on bathroom mirror)
• Examine your testicles at least once a month while you are in the shower.
• Roll each testicle between the thumb and first three fingers until the entire surface has been 
covered. The testicles should feel round and smooth, like hard-boiled eggs.
• Be on the lookout for lumps, irregularities, a change in the size of the testicle, or a dragging 
sensation. All of these are possible signs of a tumor. If you find any of them, consult your 
health care provider at once. Remember, you need to examine only the testicles themselves, 
not the sperm tubes or blood vessels that are also in the scrotum.
• Pick a regular day of the month that is easy to remember to examine your testicles. Do the 
examination more frequently if you prefer.
Testicular cancer is a rare killer of young men. But when it takes so little to protect yourself —
just half a minute a month — it makes sense to do this simple examination.

Moeller builds Shadow Empires
Comic Book Chronicles
by Jason Andracki
[Ed. Note: Part one of a two part series]
I had the great pleasure of spending 
Monday afternoon with Christopher 
Moeller talking about his career and 
about comics in general. Moeller is the 
[creator of the Shadow Empires uni- 
verse that is currently featured in the 
limited series Shadow Empires: Faith 
Conquers from Dark Horse and had 
an introductory story, “The Pas­
sage,” in Dark Horse Presents 
numbers 79-81. Also to his 
credit are the story and art on 
Rocketman: King of the 
Rocketmen and some of the 
interior art and covers Anne 
Rice’s Interview with the Vam- 
ipire, both from the regret­
fully defunct Innovation. In 
addition, Moeller provided the 
art for an adaptation of the short 
6tory “Treatment” in Andrew 
Vachss: Hard Looks for Dark 
Horse and painted an upcoming 
cover for DC’s Spectre. You can 
also enjoy Moeller’s painting of 
j the pages of comics on five trading 
cards from the Fleer Ultra X-Men 
series, a New Visions card from 
next year’s Star Wars Gal­
axy set, plus a Wol­
verine/Sabertooth 
poster.
Moeller, a native of 
Syracuse, New York, 
received a Bachelors 
of Art in Painting 
from the University 
ofMichigan School of 
Art, and a Masters of 
Fine Arts in Illustr a- 
j\tion from Syracuse 
\ University’s School 
of Visual Communi­
cation. Prior to en­
tering the comics in­
dustry, Moeller 
worked as a textile 
designer.
As a child, Moeller 
read many comics 
such as the Aveng­
ers, the Incredible 
Hulk, and Conan the 
Barbarian, but even­
tually got away from 
it. In high school he got a subscription to 
Heavy Metal because “It was cheaper 
(than buying comics every week).” While 
in college, comics such as Dave Sim’s 
Cerebus and Frank Miller’s Ronin lured 
him in once again.
Moeller’s first work in the comics field 
was for Innovation in the form of 
Rocketman: King of the Rocketmen, an
adaptation of the 1940’s pulp stories, for 
which he provided the writing and the 
painting, which was “nice for a begin­
ner. I sorta fell into it. I wanted to do 
science fiction book covers.” It was the 
portfolio that he used for a job doing 
covers that landed him the job with 
Innovation.
Oddly enough, although Moeller has 
done work for five companies, Innova­
tion was the only company he dealt with 
in person, since it was conveniently lo-
(Magic: The Gathering). Aside from 
games, Moeller would need to have 
Shadow Empires cross over to other mar­
kets. A big budget movie, toys, and, “a 
Saturday morning cartoon would be all 
the better.”
With one more issue of Shadow Em­
pires: Faith Conquers due out the first 
week of November, Moeller is certain he 
wants to continue his stories but he’s not 
sure whether or not Dark Horse will be 
publishing them in the future since Dark
cated in Wheeling, West Virginia. All of Horse’s advertising orders for the book 
his other assignments are submitted have been slow. Kitchen Sink Press has 
through Federal Express or by fax. expressed an interest in publishing any 
Moeller has been working with his upcoming series, showing definite sup-
ISHADOwi
current project, Shadow Empires, on port for expanding the Shadow Empires 
and off for about ten years. As a fan of lines outside of comics, which pleases
role playing games from his days in 
Syracuse, Moeller built the Shadow 
Empires universe as a role playing game 
universe. Two sets of battle rules have 
already been written, even though 
Moeller is only in the initial stages of 
negotiations with Wizards of the Coast past one.

more on Christopher Moeller.

Cast saves Pulp
By WLADIMIR LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
The surfer soundtrack, the cute thugs, the lurid disco bar, the Mexican 
standoffs, the blood... yup, we are welcomed to B-movie land. Only this time 
we enter through the cult door opened by none other than ex-video store- 
clerk-tumed-auteur Quentin Tarantino.
Pulp Fiction was conceived by Tarantino as “three stories about one story.” 
Three interconnecting stories based on that much beloved genre, the film- 
noir (but of course, with plenty of twists). The film tells the story of about a 
dozen people — most of them criminals, all of them lovable. However, seen 
from afar, the stories would seem quite old. Thei'e’s the guy who wants his 
boss’s wife, the boxer that doesn’t throw a fight he’s supposed to throw (that’s 
about as old as you can get) and the ubiquitous pair of hitmen doing a hit. 
What sets the story apart is that it is made more real by being made less 
plausible. Just when you think you know what’s gonna happen ... wham! 
think again.
This unpredictability of the script is contrasting with most current films. 
Nowadays, the audience is pretty much aware of what’s gonna happen after 
watching about the first 15 minutes. However, Tarantino doesn’t make his 
stories turn by the cheap trick of the “twist” (much beloved by mediocrities 
like, say, Verhoeven or Pakula). No, the difference in these “pulp” tales is 
that there is something to them, the old concept of the unfolding story (old 
’cause nobody seems to know it in Hollywood). The main trait that makes 
Tarantino such a hotshot is that he can write, while your typical UCLA hack 
scriptwriter simply cannot. But I digress....
Tarantino has 
an uncanny gift for 
film situations, but 
an even more un­
canny gift for 
snarly dialogue.
This would easily 
help him in mak­
ing a completely ggrreuw 
cynical take on genre, just showing how dumb everyone else is. However, he 
doesn’t go for that cheap trick. He loves movies so much that he cannot help 
but give his characters a moral, to make them real people. And therefore 
Bruce Willis can avenge his father by saving his would-be killer from the cast 
of“Deliverance,” even though you cannot help but smirk given how the story 
starts (the depths his father had to go to give him his gold watch).
Even at his most affectionate, Tarantino can still give the satiric commen­
tary. One of his favorites is to erase time barriers. This might be the 90’s of 
the cellular phones and the Acuras, but Uma Thurman can also speak in 50’s 
slang and John Travolta can listen to “Don’t go Boogie.” It is a warped, 
warped world.
Another Tarantino motif is to show gangsters as little kids with big guns. 
Why else would hitmen be so afraid of a wife coming home while they’re 
cleaning a mess?
Still, Tarantino couldn’t do it without his actors. Even though the dialogue 
is the real star of the movie, the cast drives it all the way.
Who else would cast Amanda Plummer as a thief, or John Travolta as a 
hitman, or Eric Stoltz (yes, the guy is in everything) as a Generation X drug 
dealer? Who else would think of putting Tim Roth at the mercy of Sam 
Jackson, who insists on calling him Ringo? These details are what keep the 
movie from taking itself too seriously and making it more like a black 
comedy.
Pulp Fiction is Tarantino’s second film as a director (a couple of his scripts 
were pathetically misused already by some other people) but already he 
shows himself as an expert in the craft. He’s the ultimate proof that film 
schools are indeed obsolete. The kid from Last Action Hero actually knows 
more about film than the NYU graduate who wants to make “important” 
films, and much more than his mothball teacher (bear with my academic 
bitterness for a second).
Tarantino makes the kind of movies that are both a smile and a glass of 
cold water. His movies are what they are for their own sake, but at the same 
time they keep your eyes and mouth open (either gawking or laughing your 
tummy out) the whole time. Yup, it is a warped, warped world.
Pulp Fiction is showing around town. For all of us mall-phobics, it is 
showing at the Squirrel Hill theater on Forward Ave. That way you and your 
par amour can go afterwards to Eat ‘n Park and ...aw, you get the idea.. Just 
go and have a good time.

Suckpump causes pain
By PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Diversions Assistant Editor
Group: Bile 
Album: Suckpump
Suggest some tracks to your best friends and 
some to your worst enemies
There is always room in the world for another 
industrial band, complete with their power- 
chord guitar lines and their vocals miked 
through fuzz-boxes. Bile, with its newly re­
leased epic EP Suckpump, adds another half- 
hour to the legacy that is immutable rock, thump­
ing their automatous percussionals (so cleverly 
labeled “cybercussion”) through the natural 
protective helmet formed by the human skull.
Possibly the most motivational song on this 
work of synthesized art is the prophetically- 
lyriced title track, which states with great angst 
and beauty:
“wheeda, wheeda/ whadda, whadda/ hooda, 
hooda/ hah!!!!!!!”
How can anyone deny the grit, the determina­
tion, the power of the struggle which the entity 
of Suckpump captures, through amazingly el­
ephantine songs like “ura f**king loser” and 
“Feeling Like S**t (Again and Again).” I feel 
every one of these songs in the bottom of my 
suppurative purulent faculties. It gives me a 
warm feeling of comfort and reassurance that 
every so often, a band is willing to tackle such 
complex issues as pyromania (“Burnt”),
commiting acts of murder while in rigor mortis 
(“I Reject”), and, of course, that anathemic can- 
cer-ballad “Head,” whose refrain lines (“My brain 
is pounding/ My brain is pounding/ My brain is 
pounding/My brain”) will doubtlessly keep cha­
grined 17-year-olds screaming in the streets, 
clutching their pancreas with glee.
@1994 Gina Volpe 
Bile’s sound oozes like pus from a wound.
The artistic statement is there, that’s for sure. 
But what we really need to ask ourselves is: Are 
we really ready for Bile? Are we wise and 
advanced enough to feel the pull of the 
Suckpump? To tell the truth, I’m just not sure.

often, because you never want to 
hear an affirmitive answer. That 
is, however, the exact question 
which Planet Hate asks with their 
latest album Mother Are You 
Mad?.
This album contains 13 tracks, 
all of which are individually 
unique. The album starts off with 
“Monster,” a hard-driving rock 
rhythm song which grabs you 
from the very start and enthralls 
you throughout its entire playing 
time. This song is enough to carry
recently. By far, my favorite track 
on the CD was number five. “Sam 
I Am” has the most inventive 
lyrics on the album and is a good 
pick-me-up for the middle of the 
album. The lyrics themselves echo 
my thoughts on the song. “Just 
one taste and then I’ve got you, oh 
the places we will go.”
And, believe me, this album 
will definetly take you places. The 
only disappointment on the al­
bum comes towards the end; 
tracks 10,11, and 12 all seem to
have the exact same basic guitar 
riffs. Fortunately this doesn’t hold 
true for the lyrics. The lyrics for 
this group hint vaguely at a more 
driven Dead Milkmen/They 
Might Be Giants type of group. 
The inventiveness of the lyrics 
will be worth any price you pay 
for this album.
Another surprise came with the 
last track, “The Pressure’s on 
Greg” The lyrics convey a deep 
sense of being in themselves, and 
when coupled with the music it 
just makes for an all-over great 
song.
The breakdown of the album is 
as follows: tracks 1,2,3, 7,9,10, 11, and 12 have that hard-driven 
rock beat behind them.
For a change to the mellow, try 
tracks 4 and 6. If you’re into per­
cussion, listen to the first minute 
of Track 8.
And, for those of you that are 
tired of the ordinary, same old 
same old, listen to Tracks 5 and 
13.
All in all, this is one of the 
better college albums to buy right
Pianist pleases with Beethoven
By ADAM KUVANS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last Wednesday the second concert of the Y 
Music Society recital series took place in the 
Carnegie Music Hall on Forbes avenue. Pianist 
Richard Goode greeted the audience with an all- 
Beethoven program.
A renowned specialist in the works of 
Beethoven, Goode has performed with virtually 
every major orchestra in the world’s music capi­
tals. Goode’s reputation for a deep understand­
ing of the repertoire precedes him, and his nu­
merous recordings have earned him consider­
able praise, as well as a Grammy award.
In this concert of all Beethoven sonatas, Goode 
had a prime opportunity to display the wondrous 
qualities of his playing. In fact, he did much 
more.
Goode began with Beethoven’s Sonata No. 5 in 
C minor (Op. 10 No.l), a piece not often per­
formed on the concert stage. I would like to say 
that hearing such a rare Beethoven sonata (as 
opposed to the more popular Moonlight or 
Waldstein) was quite a treat.
Unfortunately, the essence of the work is a 
series of occasionally depressing, always dry 
movements contained within a rather straight­
forward structure. While I do admit that Goode’s 
playing was amazingly graceful, and his attempts 
to infuse his own passionate enthusiasm into the 
piece were admirable, itis simply beyond anyone’s 
ability to make this sonata entirely interesting. 
Looking in my program guide, I began to fear 
having to sit through any more Beethoven sona­
tas in this vein. Fortunately, my attitude quickly 
reversed itself as the second sonata began.
Sonata No. 18 in E Flat Major (Op. 31, No. 3) 
acted as the catalyst for a remarkable display of 
musical ingenuity, passion, and understanding 
from both the composer and performer. Goode 
successfully captured the bright, witty allegro of 
the sonata, and his incredibly clean playing 
brought out the wonder in every note of this 
piece. His complete mastery of the quite inter­
esting rhythmic structure, especially in the 
scherzo, illustrated the wonder of both the piece 
and the playing. I immediately felt an electrify­
ing presence from Goode as he furiously yet 
humorously attacked the presto confuoco. Every 
phrase of the piece made sense, and the work 
came together in a wonderful display of wit and 
grace from Goode’s fingertips.
As this new energy permeated the concert hall, 
Goode continued his intensity with his playing of 
the Sonata No. 30 in E Major (Op. 109). This 
work, as compared to the previous one, has a 
certain solemnity which likens it to an 18th 
century Bach sacred work.
Unlike the first piece on the performance, 
Goode had no difficulty showing the rich, almost 
choral qualities of the last movement. In form, 
the last movement strongly resembles a fugue, 
and Goode’s extremely delicate playing brought 
out all of the subtleties associated with such a 
structure. Goode’s remarkable performance ex­
tracted all of the elements of Bach hiding in this 
complex sonata showing an incredible level of 
understanding.
After a brief intermission, Goode resumed the 
performance with Sonata No. 6 in F Major (Op. 
10, No. 2). As usual, Goode maintained his excep­
tional level of playing, though I did consider this 
sonata as a mere bridge to the last work on the 
program: the Sonata No. 26 in E Flat Major (Op. 
81a “Les Adieux”). This sonata gave a powerful 
conclusion to a program of unusual character. 
The delicacy and warmth with which Goode 
approached the piece was immediately appar­
ent, and he seemed to make even this complex 
sonata understandable.
While listening to Goode peiform the piece 
with an intensity unequaled by any modem day 
pianist, 1 realized how intelligent the choices of 
the sonatas had been. Goode was able to perform 
sonatas of varying character and color which 
combined to form a coherent whole.
The entire program left the audience with an 
impression of the magnificence of Beethoven’s 
music, as well as Goode’s stunning musicality.

Movie: Wes Craven’s New Night­
mare
Starring: Heather Langenkamp, 
Robert Englund, Wes Craven
Many years ago, Wes Craven 
brought us the first Nightmare 
on Elm Street flick, planting the 
image of 12-inch razomails and 
charbroiled flesh where once 
danced visions of sugarplums. 
What followed was a large stream 
of installments in the Freddy 
saga, each more like Dreamscape 
than the last.
The world thought they had 
seen the last of Freddy, with 
1992’s release Freddy’s Dead: the 
FinalNightmare. Whatmostfans 
didn’t acknowledge, however, was 
that the movie started off with 
thewords“10Years From Today” 
panning across the bottom of the 
screen, leavingleeway for another 
decade of Kreuger sequels.
New Nightmare (or, as it’s be- 
ingadvertised, Wes Craven’s New 
Nightmare) doesn’t really address 
this aspect, as neat a loophole as 
it is. Instead, it revolves around 
the concept of Freddy as a form in 
which Craven had temporarily 
imprisoned the raw evil that re­
curs in mythology, and what hap­
pens when the evil is set free by 
the ceasing of production of 
Freddy movies. The idea was that 
the evil enjoyed being Freddy so
ticularly Heather Langenkamp, cute portrayal by the actors o

much that it kept the form for a 
while and came out into the real 
world to play with the actors that 
made the first Nightmare, par-
writes the next chapter every 
morning, fatal as it may be.
It’s an interesting perspective 
that the movie holds, as well as a
like it was written by an eight- 
year-old, and the whole plot is 
just kooky, ping-ponging between 
Nightmare 1 sendoffs and authen­
tically scary scenes (the scene in 
which Heather’s eight-year-old 
son Dylan, portrayed by Miko 
Hughes climbs to the top of a 
rocket-shaped jungle gym to try 
to reach God sent a chill up my 
spine).
The otherthing this movie lacks 
is the hilarity that Freddy nor­
mally inspires. This Freddy is 
dead serious (no pun intended), 
and never makes so much a 
wisecrack. I missed that, because 
it seemed that Kreuger was the 
warmest (again, no pun intended) 
of all the killer characters. Rob­
ert Englund, nonetheless, givi 
good re-portrayal of the scarred 
one, a performance which shows 
up in the credits as “FREDDY 
KREUGER ... HIMSELF.” If we 
could take out the little “Never- 
Ending-Story”-esque use of the 
script, it would probably be a 
much better film. In any case, a 
die-hardMg&i/nare fan will have 
fun with the re-enactment of the 
first ever Freddy slashing, and 
Heather Langenkamp’s deadpan 
to the nurse in the hospital who 
asks her if she has authorization 
to be in the intensive care wing: 
“Screw your pass.” If you’re look­
ing for a good Freddy film, I rec­
ommend the first six.

Lord of the Flies
This film, directed by Peter Brook in 1963, is 
based on William Golding’s apocalyptic novel of the 
same name. Starring a group of young children, the 
only difference between this movie and The Little 
Rascals is that Spanky never killed a pig, nor 
spilled its blood. He did however have a hell of a 
cow-lick.
Shabbily shot in black and white, the movie is 
fairly interesting if you like soft kiddie porn. No, 
just kidding. Actually, it tells the story of societal 
degeneration on an island inhabited only by young 
boys. Remember kids, we’ll have fun, fun, fun after 
daddy takes the fear of punishment and the aver­
sion to sin away. For a dollar, you can’t go wrong.
At 6, 8,10 pm and midnight.
Friday, October 28
The Crow
Starring Brandon Lee, Bruce Lee’s ill-fated son, 
this film is a moody piece about a rock-and-roll star 
come back to life to avenge his girlfriend. In the 
tradition of Batman and Cinderella, this film is an 
examination into the darkest deepest soul of evil 
and the sweetness of revenge. It also has a nice 
soundtrack.
It’s fairly dark, so I suppose it would be a good date 
movie, and there is very little kiddie pom. Also, for 
an added attraction, you can go to the movie know­
ing that the star was shot during the filming and 
that he appears in scenes he never filmed. ¿Spooky, 
no?
At 6, 8,10 pm and midnight.
Saturday, October 29
Wolf
Everyone likes werewolves, whether they’re played 
by Michael Landon or Michael J. Fox. Werewolves 
are lovable and cuddly... until, hell, they tear your 
face off and eat your cartilage. However, Jack 
Nicholson and Michelle Pfieffer want to dispel this 
fluffy notion. That’s where Wolf comes in.
Nicholson is a middle-aged werewolf who needs a 
little self-esteem. By becoming a werewolf, he is 
able to get over his mid-life crisis and have sex with 
Michelle Pfieffer to boot. No kiddie porn, and will 
probably be a good date movie. For ten dollars, you 
could go wrong, but for one dollar, no way.
At 5, 7:30,10pm, and 12:30am.
Sunday, October 30
The Pit and the Pendulum
Based on Edgar Allan Poe’s story of the same 
name, this story is about a pit and a pendulum. It 
was directed by Roger Corman and stars Vincent 
Price, who plays neither the pit nor the pendulum.
Finely filmed and well adapted, Poe’s story comes 
to life on the screen. The pendulum is well por­
trayed, as well as the pit. ¿What more could you 
want?
At 6, 8,10pm, and midnight.

Phipps shows unique flowers
Cruisin'the 'Burgh
by Christina Farrell
For the last 101 years, Phipps Conserva­
tory has been one of Pittsburgh’s best loved 
attractions. Many of the world’s most unique 
and beautiful plants are currently displayed, 
as they always have been, in the rooms of 
Phipps. Right now, the 1994 Fall Flower 
Show is in full bloom, so to speak.
One of the exhibitions is a special collec­
tion of bonsai from the Phipps Collection. 
Included is the first major bonsai obtained 
by the Conservatory, and tropical bonsai 
from the Mel Teles collection. Through 
Ikebana International Pittsburgh Chapter 
25, Ikebana Japanese flower arrangements 
are also featured in the display, whose ar­
rangements are simplistic in design, but 
stunning in beauty. The five schools repre­
sented by the designs are Ichiyo, Ikenobo, 
Koryu, Ohara, and Sogetsu.
Also being featured for the Fall Show is a
seven foot peacock made from blue statice, 
yellow kalanchoe, lavender mums, and ferns. 
He stands proudly at the entrance of the South 
Conservatory and his exquisite “tail” drapes 
across the entire room.
Other topiary animals you might see as you 
walk through Phipps range from cute little 
bunnies to a majestic lion. The Stove Room 
especially has an abundance of creatures hid­
ing among the plants.
Some standard favorites at the Conserva­
tory include The Orchid Room, filled with 
vibrant colors and scents, and The Victoria 
Room with rare tropical water lilies. Outside, 
The Japanese Courtyard Garden and The 
Flower Garden are enhanced by the rich colors 
of autumn.
For those who do not know where Phipps is, 
it is located in Schenley Park behind Baker 
Hall. Since it is so close, it’s an ideal place for 
a between-class-escape or a relaxing study 
break.
After finishing your tour of Phipps, chances 
are you may have been filled with the desire to 
become one with nature. If this is the case, 
take a walk through Schenley Park. Next to 
the Schenley Park Visitor’s Center, which is 
presently closed, there are steps leading down 
to walking paths and a man-made lake. This 
time of year is a great time to explore the paths
and take in the colors of fall.

File 13
By Carey Clevenger
WARNING: The material con­
tained in this column is the abso­
lute truth. Can you afford to pay 
the price of knowing too much?
Aliens. The Illuminati. The 
Man. College administration. 
Different names for the same evil 
entity: the global Conspiracy that 
affects us all! We have been 
conned into submission by the 
puppet masters for too long, and 
now the truth must be known! 
The best weapon against these 
evil geniuses is the very truth 
that they have withheld for so 
long.
The Conspiracy is all-encom­
passing. You may think that you 
are not involved, but think again! 
The only person who is not a 
slave to their villainy is the Man 
pulling the strings (from his un­
derground bungalow somewhere 
in Antarctica). All of us operate 
within the Conspiracy every day. 
Don’t believe anything anyone 
tells you about Them!
Who are these vile, mind-con­
trolling supermen? Unfortu­
nately, this is not an easy ques­
tion, because Their numbers are 
so great and powerful. However, 
in an attempt to confuse us, They 
have fictionalized Their exist­
ences through the media, giving 
us clues to Their real intentions. 
Do not, I repeat... do not read this 
column. Memorize it.
Exhibit A: Real Men
On the surface, Real Men is a 
comedy starring John Ritter and 
Jim Belushi. That’s what They
wanted you to see. In truth, it is 
one of the most revealing sources 
of information about the Con­
spiracy.
In this “fictional story,” we learn 
that the U.S. Government has 
unwittingly doomed the world by 
dumping toxic chemicals into the 
ocean, and the only things that 
can save us are aliens, who in 
exchange desire a glass of water.
But it doesn’t stop there! We 
soon learn that the C.I.A. has 
been given a choice: to either ac­
cept the generous offer to save 
the world, or procure the “Big 
Gun,” a weapon large enough to 
destroy an entire planet. Of 
course, the U.S. military/indus­
trial complex wants the “Big 
Gun,” and the KGB wants to stop 
the C.I.A. from obtaining it ... 
just one example of the arms of 
the Conspiracy working together, 
oblivious to their cooperation. 
This means that the fate of the 
world lies in the hands of two 
renegade C.I.A. agents. Literally, 
the entire world is against them. 
We know that they will win, of 
course. If the Conspiracy released 
films where They won, we would 
all consider Them more of a threat 
than we do.
Much important information 
can be obtained from this film. 
First, the U.S. does in fact com­
municate with extra-terrestrials. 
Second, the Conspiracy does ac­
tively disinform the public by re­
leasing useful information to dis­
reputable sources (this is indi­
cated by the scene involving the 
tabloid). And finally, we learn 
that even clowns are not above 
being dupes of the conspiracy.
Exhibit B: They Live!
What’s the best way to mislead 
people about the Conspiracy? 
Make a movie about it starring a 
professional wrestler! Of course, 
this logic backfired, because ev­

eryone knows that professional 
wrestling is itself a conspiracy. 
But that just means that people 
think that the film is just as fake 
as wrestling really is, instead of 
thinking that it is just as realistic 
as wrestling is supposed to be. 
Pretty smooth, huh?
They Live! stars “Rowdy” Roddy 
Piper as a drifter/construction 
worker/Conspiracy buster. He 
can’t help but notice an odd little 
church close to the construction 
site, which is soon raided by the 
police. Roddy breaks into the joint 
later and breaks open a false wall, 
concealing a box full of sunglasses.
These are special sunglasses, 
however: they block out the 
Conspiracy’s mind-controlling 
signals, allowingyou to see things 
as they really are. Advertising 
billboards take on more ominous 
messages, such as “Obey” and 
“Consume,” and even some of the 
city’s authoritative personalities 
turn out to be aliens, controlling 
and manipulating the populace 
like mindless cattle!
Roddy’s only friend is a dupe to 
Their evil schemes, and it takes a 
little convincing (and a seven- 
minute fight scene) for him to see 
the light. But when he does, it’s 
time to hit the Conspiracy where 
it hurts! Roddy and his buddy 
join up with the enlightened hu­
mans in an effort to stamp out the 
Alien Conspiracy once and for 
all: by destroying the signal trans­
mitter.
We can learn much about the 
Conspiracy from this film as well. 
First, they do employ mind-alter- 
ing signals to mislead us. Second, 
there are aliens here on Earth, 
and they’re working with Them! 
Third, the Conspiracy must per­
form some sort of bio-genetic al­
terations on professional wres­
tlers, because Roddy takes quite 
a licking throughout the course 
of the film.
Even I am affected by the Con­
spiracy! The Conspiracy has in­
terfered in my efforts to procure 
the following films, but I will 
share with you what I have heard 
about them from my Sources.
Solar Crisis: Possibly the only 
film which features one of the 
most important and little-known 
branches of the Conspiracy: The 
Men in Black. The Men in Black 
are a mysterious organization 
who follow U.F.O.’s around and 
forcefully keep witnesses frpm 
telling anyone what they have 
seen. They are on screen for quite 
some time; get a good look at 
them, they may come for you some 
day.
Pizza Man: Bill Maher, a pizza 
delivery man, uncovers an inter­
national Conspiracy plot involv­
ing Ollie North, Walter Mondale, 
and Michael Dukakis, to name a 
few. This is a good movie to see if 
you plan to attack the Conspiracy 
on the political level, or if you 
wonder what these people have 
been doing in the past few years.
Soylent Green: Let’s see ... is 
it “You are what you eat” or “You 
eat what you are?” Well, in any 
case, soylent green, the world’s 
most popular foodstuff, is made 
out of people. Nothing goes better 
with this movie than a nice help­
ing of Armor Star Potted Meat.
Rating these films is difficult, 
because they are all so informa­
tive. See these films as soon as 
possible! Your life may depend on 
it.
