Tartans Lose To 
Panthers, Lions
By Mike Capabianco
Carnegie's hard luck cagers drop­
ped two heart breakers last week, 
losing to Pitt 44-38, and to Penn 
State to the tune of 35-33.
Victory was offered to the home 
team at the foul line in both cases 
but they refused to accept it. Tech 
outscored Pitt 32-26 and on Friday 
they outscored the Staters by 26-22. 
The sad story was evident at the 
charity station, where the visitors 
cashed in and took the prize money 
from the home men.
The Tartans fighting for all their 
worth, outplayed the visitors until 
the dying seconds of each game. 
Lacking that final knockout punch, 
the Skibos were forced to loose the 
initiative to the opponents only on 
foul points.
Pitt was led by co-captains Ma- 
larkey, Artman, and also Jones, the 
latter delivering the final lethal 
blows to the Tartans on interecept- 
ed passes and fast-break “bunnies.” 
DeBortoli, Tech’s stalwart guard, 
was high scorer with twelve mark­
ers in the asset column.
At the outset, Tech outrushed,

Cwen-Directed Hop 
With Walter’s Band Is 
Week Behind Schedule
To inaugurate the 1943 social sea­
son, the Cwens, sophomore hon­
orary, are sponsoring the Soph Hop 
to be held January 30. Ches Walters 
and his band, well known around 
the campus and Pittsburgh, will 
play for this all-school dance in 
Thistle Hall from 9 to 1. Listed in 
the handbook to take place January 
23, the dance has been postponed 
one week.
The Cwens have taken over the 
direction of the affair with the aid 
of the Scimitars who were spon­
sors last year. In accordance with 
the spirit of the class of ’45, tickets 
for the dance will sell for $1.45 per 
couple, and may be obtained from 
any Cwen.
Helen Robinson, president of the 
Cwens and chairman of the dance, 
will be ably assisted by Pat Mc­
Cullough and Peggy Cole of the 
Publicity Committee.
Although sponsored by the soph­
omore class, it is an all school dance. 
The Cwens and other sophomores 
alike invite the entire student body 
to a gala evening of dancing and re­
freshments.

The Tartan can at last announce, 
with somewhat less alarm than was 
experienced by Paul Revere when 
he announced the coming of the 
British, that the “Tech-Sperts” are 
coming—coming out in the open 
where every science-minded Tech- 
ite can take a good aim and “mow 
them down.” The ammunition, of 
course, will be questions, and the 
only defense the Tech-Sperts will 
have will be their mental armor 
plate, which is mighty, weak in some 
spots. The point will be, of course, 
to find the places where the armor 
is thin and easily pierced by some 
heavy-calibre questions.
The Tech-Sperts are really a staff 
set up as a new feature of the Car­
negie Technical. There will be eight
or nine students, representing every 
branch of engineering, who will at­
tempt to answer any scientific ques­
tions thrown at them purely from 
what they already know—no out­
side reference material will be al­
lowed! A page of • the Technical 
will be devoted to the questions 
and answers, the editor being John 
Wolff. Incidentally, failure of this 
group to answer will result in the 
payment of two dollars to the 
brainy marksman who stumped 
them.
Other new features of the Tech­
nical will be a Night School page, to 
be called Tech-Nite, and the com­
bination of Techno-Logic and Tech­
no-Digest into one column to be 
named Techno-Mural.

Tech’s Casualty List 
Increased To Twelve
Former Tech students, Wayne 
Forsythe and Larry Coulter, have 
been killed in action, the War De­
partment has announced. Lt. For­
sythe, a former grid star, entered 
Tech An 1937, and played tackle on 
the football team for two years. On 
June 2, 1941, he left Tech for the 
Army Air Corps, Barton School of 
Aeronautics at Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
From there he was transferred to 
Ellington Field whre he was made 
an instructor. Forsythe was killed 
when his plane crashed in an at­
tempted forced landing during a 
training flight.
Larry Coulter, M’40, was reported 
missing in the Solomon Islands, on 
November 10, 1942. Notice of his 
death was published in the Tartan 
last year but was omitted from last 
week’s casualty list. In the same 
articles of last week, Lt. Richard 
Herpich, E’41, was reported as hav­
ing been “killed in airplane crash.” 
Later information has revealed that 
Lt. Herpich died suddenly in the 
Hospital at Hamilton Field, Calif., 
July 30, 1942.
James Rice, Chem. Eng. ’43, 
Is Regimental Commander
Last week James Rice, Chem. En^ 
gineer ’43 was appointed cadet 
colonel of the Tech R. O. T. C. Reg­
iment, This semester’s new officers 
were appointed to fill the vacancies 
left by the graduation of last De­
cember’s class. The new officers are: 
Regiment’
Col. James Rice — Regimental 
Commander.
Lt. Col Apt—Regimental Execu­
tive Officer.
Battalion
Major Chesarek — 1st Battalion 
Commander.
Major Croop—2nd Battalion Com­
mander.
Major Dumm — 3rd Battalion 
Commander.
Major Hewitt — 4th Battalion 
Commander.
Mr. Hornell Hart, professor of 
sociology at Duke University and 
specialist in marriage relations, 
will speak on “Love and Marriage 
in Wartime” at today’s assembly, 
which will be held at 11:30 in the 
Little Theatre of Fine Arts. When 
he spoke at Tech only two years ago 
on “Love and Marriage in the Ma­
chine Age,” a large crowd enthusi­
astically received his humorous and 
timely talk. He has also appeared 
at the Pittsburgh Community For­
um, and those who have heard him 
agree that he is unequaled in dis­
cussing the problems of young peo­
ple.
In 1932 he was in charge of meas­
uring changes in social attitudes for 
the Hoover Commission on Social 
Trends. He has been connected with 
the University of Iowa Child Wel­
fare Research Station and has 
taught social ethics at Bryn Mawr 
College and Hartford Seminary.
He has made a special study of the 
results of different kinds of mar­
riages, and of family problems. 
Among his many books are the 
Technical of SociaT Progress, Per­
sonality and the Family, Living Re­
ligion, Skeptic’s Quest, and Chart 
for Happiness. This well-known 
author also contributes to such mag­
azines as the “American Journal of 
Sociology,” “International Journal 
of Religious Education,” and “New 
Republic.”

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1943
ßdUoM.' AtmcJtaisi
The following challenging and timely letter was received by the TARTAN and 
is passed on to the students with the recommendation that they think earnestly about 
this indictment of their attitude. ~ Our comment will-be made next week.
“. . . We, the student body, have failed to hold up our end of the war 
effort, for looking back at ’42 we can find little to point to with pride. The 
Blood Donor campaign, with all the support received from the Tartan, 
barely escaped being a flop. The Scrap Drive lacks both spirit and results. 
Even the War Stamp and Bond sales are far below what they could and 
should be if proper steps were taken. And to top it off, there are no valid 
or worthy excuses for their failures . . . we must realize that whatever 
we accomplish, no matter how little, brings our victory just that much 
closer.
“The problem of getting to do these ‘little’ things is not an easy one nor 
is it readily solved. It requires all of the students (and some of the fac­
ulty) to actively participate in an organized plan of action. The follow­
ing is a tentative skeleton plan comprised of ideas successfully used on 
other campuses. There are six major points.
“1. Let’s stick a 10c or 25c war stamp on every admission ticket to our 
dances, teas, etc. ... If we can turn out enmasse for a dance we can 
certainly contribute that much towards the war effort.
“2. Let’s organize affairs where a few pounds of rubber or scrap metal 
would be the admission price (or reduce it substantially). These materials, 
needed by our government, are becoming increasingly difficult to get.
“3. Let’s organize a Scrap Drive in which the various campus organ­
izations will compete, as at the war stamp booth, for the best performance. 
Some colleges were very successful with this type of campaign.
“4. Let’s get the Tartan to consistently devote as much time and space 
for the war activities as it recently did for the Blood Donor campaign and 
the school elections.
“5. Let’s get the interested and capable faculty to organize and lead 
(with us) weekly forums concerning the events, issues, and problems ac­
cruing the war.
“6. Let’s organize a ‘War Activities Council’—rather than leave these 
important duties to a Student Council which has failed in this respect. The 
Council’s sole duty would be to conceive, organize, coordinate, and direct 
all war activities so that we may contribute effectively and efficiently to 
the war program ...” . " ^

The meeting was called to order at 
7:10 p. m.
Absent: Messrs. Emberg, Reisacher,
Dolan, Martin, and Thomson and Miss 
Bruce.
NEW BUSINESS
Mr. Rose moved that Council accept the 
resignation of Ted Nierenberg as Business 
Manager of the TARTAN.
Motion carried. ,
Mr. Rose moved that the appointment 
of Wilbur Thomas as Business Manager 
of the TARTAN be approved.
Motion carried.
Mr. Boyce moved that the petition from 
the Cwens to hold the Soph Hop on Janu­
ary 30 in Thistle Hall from 9 to 1 be ap­
proved with the understanding that an 
account would be opened for them in 
Council, Council handling all financial 
transactions, and that they have at least 
$50 in their account. All profits and 
losses will be assumed by them. , 
Motion carried.
Mr. Wolff moved that the petition from 
the Delta Skull Society to hold the Junior
Prom February 13 in Thistle Hall from 
9 to 1 be approved with the same under­
standing thkt applies to the Cwen peti­
tion. The*Delta Skull account, however, 
must contain $75 instead of $50.
Motion carried.
OLD BUSINESS
It was moved to approve the revised 
By-Laws to the Student Council Consti­
tution with the exception of Section 8. 
Since there was some controversy over 
Section 4, Part 1, concerning the number 
of names required on an election peti­
tion, it was decided to include this part 
in Section '8.
Motion carried.
After some discussion, the number of 
names on an election petition was set at 
15.
It was moved to approve Section 8, 
concerning method of election.
Motion Carried.
Adjournment.
Respectfully submitted,

this TARTAN. In the future we will expend every effort to continue in 
our former more or less normal fashion.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not

Critic’s Corner - - - "Morning's At Seven*
Mr. McLean has made a lot out of little in his production of “Morning’s 
at Seven.” An unambitious little piece, it had a homey plot which was 
weakened by a number of unsympathetic lines, and these, in turn, produced 
some confused and contradictory interpretations. But the whole was 
consistent and satisfactory.
Miss Walker was excellent as the slow-moving Ida, and Miss Gerson 
as her sister Essie. Less spectacular in less sympathetic roles were Miss 
Burns and Miss Brown. Miss Fineman was cursed with one of the mpst 
moronic romantic leads it has ever been our mistfortune to witness. That 
Myrtle appeared even slightly plausible is a compliment to her acting.
Best among the male characters was Mr. Apell, who, after coming off 
second best in a tussle with Shaw, came through admirably as the easy- 
gbing Tiior. Mr. Harding and Mr. Rose were good as the two aging eccen­
trics, and Mr. Knaak in his interpretation, was real enough, though we 
would have liked a little more of the pathos which was written into the 
part, and a little less of the comedy. I
As a matter of fact, we would have liked a little less comedy all the 
way through. If the author chooses to probe into the lives of little people, 
whose problems and frustrations are enormous in their own world, mdst 
he hold them up, like a little boy waving his maiden aunt’s underclothes, 
for the world to laugh at. There is so miich not to laugh at, yet the audi­
ence was in stitches. This cannot be blamed on the director, for the lines 
themselves, in contradiction to the agonizing situations, approach bur­
lesque. Perhaps it could be labedel “A criticism of dull people” . . . and 
a jeering criticism, at that.
WAR 
IS ON THE WIRES!
In our advertising, we ask the public 
to make no unnecessary telephone 
calls—especially Long Distance calls to 
centers of war activity—and to keep 
all calls as brief as possible.
Here are the reasons for this request:
1. War is crowding telephone lines 
with a tremendous volume of 
calls.
2. We cannot obtain materials to 
expand our facilities because 
copper, aluminum, nickel, steel# 
tin and rubber are needed for 
fighting equipment.
For the duration, please keep your use 
of telephone lines to the minimum*
War Calls Must Go Through!

was in hot water until the memor­

SKI BO SPORTLIGHT
On Swimming, Basketball
By Don French, Sports Editor
Varsity competition suffered a dismal week as far as final scores and 
tabulations are concerned. The basketball team went down to defeat at 
the hands of Pitt and Penn State while the swimmers were dealt heavy 
blows by Oberlin and Penn State. On the surface these results look dis­
couraging but actually they aren’t as bad as they sound.
The tanksters met, for their first two meets of the season, the two strong­
est teams in the league. They are also likely to come out second best in their 
duel with Westminster next weekend. However, they seem to have the neces­
sary material to top Case and Western Reserve when they meet them later on 
in the season. The rest of the meets with Kent, Slippery Rock, Edinboro 
Teachers, Grove City, and W. & J. have been cancelled on account of the war.
The Tanksters have encountered rough and tough sailing this semester 
due to the lack of first string material. They would have had one of the 
best teams in Tech history if the seniors had not graduated and if a couple 
of previously elijgible juniors had not met up with the probation bugaboo. 
The swimmers in question are Johnny Dowd, captain of this year’s team 
and a consistent winner in the 220 and 440 yard freestyle events, and 
George Tankosich, another freestyler. In place of Dowd, the tanksters 
elected Cris Smith as acting captain.
Hoopsters Lose Close Battles
Coach Hannum’s cagers might be dubbed the “Unlucky Skibos” since 
they have received much more than their share of tough luck. In the Case, 
Pitt, and Penn State contests the Tartans showed they had the stuff to win 
but in each case were nosed out in the final moments of play.
To show how disappointed the hoopsters were upon losing to Penn 
State Friday, a couple of players threw themselves on the floor and almost 
wept as the final whistle sounded.

Stephen W. Marcinizyn Heads 
New Evening Student Council
Stephen W. Marcinizyn continues 
his leadership of Evening School ac­
tivities, being elected president of 
Student Council for the second time. 
As we all know, council faced the 
very grave danger of being discon­
tinued this year; and he, realizing 
that this would greatly retard the 
progress Evening Student Council 
has made since its beginning, finally 
decided that it was up to him to be 
the leader again. This year has 
been, without a doubt, the most dif­
ficult in the history of Evening 
School and Steve’s guidance and ex­
perience have been greatly appre­
ciated by all who realize this fact.
In September, 1932 he began his 
first semester at Carnegie Institute 
of Technology and has since been 
studying toward an Electrical En­
gineering degree. Besides his fine 
school work Steve has been very ac­
tive in extra-curricular activities. 
He started his career along this line 
almost at once, and, being a very en­
ergetic fellow, became interested in 
the functions of Evening School. He 
worked as hard on Evening Student 
Council activities as he did on his 
class work. This resulted in his elec­
tion as President of Council for 1939- 
1940. The following year he became 
the Council Social Chairman and 
Vice President of the College of En­
gineering.
He has been employed at West- 
inghouse Electric & Manufacturing 
Company for the past six years. 
His scholastic achievements only 
echo his success in business.
“Mornings At Seven” 
Runs Jan. 15th-23rd
“Morning’s at Seven,” the first 
production of the second semester 
given by the day school Drama De­
partment, shows promise of being 
an interesting and entertaining one 
and will run from January 15th 
through January 23rd. All evening 
students interested in reviewing 
this play may obtain tickets by 
presenting their registration cards 
at the Registrar’s office. Students 
of all colleges are entitled to attend 
these plays, and are urged to claim 
their tickets immediately, while 
they are still available.
Share-A-Ride
In conjunction with our “Share- 
a-ride” column we will continue to 
print all offers sent in to the Plaid. 
Mt. Lebanon residents should be in­
terested in the following:
Horace Lamberton will ride any­
one from the campus to Mt. Leb­
anon two evenings a week. He 
leaves school Tuesday at 9:30 and 
Thursday at 10:30 and those inter­
ested may get in touch with him 
by calling LO. 1500 or contacting 
him at home 230 Beverly Road.
(Driving to school is not consid­
ered joy-riding by the O. P. A. 
either and students are permitted to 
use their cars for this puspose.)

Post-Holiday Dane
All-College Party 
Set For Union Feb. 6
Evening Student Council hereby 
regretfully announces the cancella­
tion of the Post-Holiday Dance 
which had been scheduled for Sat­
urday, January 23. The sharp de­
crease in student enrollment nec­
essitates this action, for the socials 
must be adapted to the probable 
changes in attendance. Further 
consideration will be given to this 
problem, but for the present only 
one additional change has been 
made. That is, a party at the Car­
negie Union has been substituted 
for the St. Valentine’s Dance of Feb­
ruary 6. This party should not by 
any means be considered as a sec­
ondary measure for its potentialities 
are positively boundless. There 
will be “juke box” dancing, ping 
pong, card games, and other special 
features which will appeal even to 
the most versatile. Any student— 
day, night, or defense—at Carnegie 
Tech may attend, and friends of stu­
dents will be welcome. There will 
be a slight admission charge to be 
announced later.
It seems that the chief objection 
to attendance at Night School func­
tions is that transportation facilities 
are inadequate, yet both the Carne­
gie Union and Thistle Hall are cen­
trally located and easily accessible 
by street car or bus.
The Carnegie Union is located on 
Forbes Street at the Beeler Street 
intersection right at the street car 
stop and the stop for Thistle Hall is 
only the next one further out Forbes 
Street.

Let’s Get In The Swim; 
Mixed Group Wednesday
To all those who are not familiar 
with the swimming privileges avail­
able to the Tech Evening students, 
the Plaid once again takes this op­
portunity to pass the information to 
everyone.
Since the school collects a mere 
$2.50 out of the $3.00 general fee 
each semester, the Administration 
has generously consented to allow 
evening students the use of the 
swimming pool every Wednesday 
evening from 6:30 to 10:30. The 
pool is open to all students for mix­
ed swimming. Your registration 
card is your key for admittance, so 
why not take advantage of the op­
portunity? To those who really en­
joy this sport, be sure to help swell 
the attendance, for the school can­
not be expected to continue with 
this offer should the pool remain 
empty. If you don’t enjoy swim­
ming, come out for spite. Make the 
school keep the pool open.
