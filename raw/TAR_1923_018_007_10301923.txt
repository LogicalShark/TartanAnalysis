The Rev. Kinley McMillen, pastor} 
of the Sheraden Presbyterian Church, [ 
has been appointed student pastor for 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
He will assume his new duties at

JOY RULES RAMPANT
(By Carl Gunther.)
The burning of Rome, the discov­
ery of gunpowder, Napoleon’s return 
from Elba, and the Eighteenth 
Amendment merged into significance 
when Carnegie, after ten years of in­
sistent trying, left Pitt with the les­
ser end of a 7 to 2 score and the 
greatly outweighed Plebes splendidly 
played the Pitt Frosh to a 6 to 6 
tie. Yet marvelous as these feats 
are in themselves, they were greatly 
enhanced by the joyous celebration 
that followd, a celebration marked 
by a fine spirit and keen sportsman­
ship that only a great institution like 
Carnegie Tech can foster.
Immediately after the game Carne­
gie grads-to-be, and those that have 
been, overflowed the fields is a gush 
of sublime ecslacy violating even the 
sacred persons of Wally Steffen and 
Bert Munhall, the latter being favor­
ed (?) be three kisse upon the un­
der portion of his cranium, carried 
the team from the field bodily, and 
gradually percolated through the 
gates to join again and parade care­
free through Oakland headed by the 
Kilties.

Leader Sullivan, Drum Major Hogle, 
and their kilties—sans kilts—leading,

Conditions Similar to Those 
of Last Year
On Tuesday, November 13, at the 
genoral assembly, the Thistle sales 
campaign starts, and will last until 
4:30 Friday, November 1G. Squads 
will be organized precisely as in the 
Y. M. C. A. campaign and not a per­
son in the entire school will be ex­
empt from the attentions of the sales­
men.
As a special inducement to those 
¦who may be in financial straits, the 
Thistle board has reestablished the 
easy payment plan. It is simply this. 
Those who wish to spread the expen­
diture over a longer period of time 
may, during this campaign, signify 
their desire to purchase the book by 
paying $2.50 down, and the remaining 
$2.00 when the book is delivered.
Meanwhile, the taking of individual 
pictures of Seniors and fraternity 
members is going right along. Some

ARCHITECTURAL CLUB 
PASSED BY COUNCIL
The Carnegie Architectural Society 
was recognized by the Student Coun­
cil at the meeting last Wednesday.
A petition from the members was 
¦well received. The organization for 
the past two years has endeavored 
to stimulate and develop interest in 
architecture. To do this they pro­
cured Miller Hall for the member? 
to live in. At the weekly meeting 
held at the hall sketchings, still and 
life drawings and water colorings 
are studied.

LEGISLATION A TOPIC
Capacity audiences, composed main­
ly of engineers and business execu­
tives of the Pittsburgh district, heard 
the lectures given last week by Dean 
Dexter S. Kimball upon “Business Or­
ganization.” Dean Kimball's theme 
was presented in three divisions: 
The New Industrial Day, Science in 
Industry, and Industrial Legislation, 
each the subject of a separate address.
The first lecture contrasted the pro­
duction methods of a few years ago, 
when the farm was a complete indus­
trial unit, with those of today when 
the farm is devoted solely to agricul­
ture and the mechanical arts, past the 
small shop stage, are gathered lit 
great “single purpose plants” where 
the aim is a mass of unified, standard 
product. The change has caused a 
transfer of skill from the worker to 
his tool. Because the situation and 
its problems are new, new ways must 
be found to handle it.
The second lecture was concerned 
largely with > the industrial laws of 
the day. They protect the worker, the 
community, and tho investor; but 
they throttle the economic law of sup­
ply and demand. Because they are 
founded on experience rather than 
prudence and foresight, they rarely 
forestall evils.
The third described the commen­
surate growth of industry and of a 
sense of stewardship in the proprie­
tors and their managers. The mod­
ern ideas in industrial relations, such 
as that of giving the workers a voice 
in the management, were set forth 
with their possibilities and limita­
tions.
PLEBE CLASS ELECTS 
PLUMMER PRESIDENT
At Assembly Tuesday, October 16, 
with T. E. Hughes, Freshmen ad­
visor, in charge, the Plebes of Science 
and industries, cast primary ballots 
for their class officers. The nomina­
tions were as follows:

The following Tuesday after the 
pep meeting, the officers for the first 
year were elected. The results of the 
election were:

Dodge; secretary, Irvin; treasurer, 
Dickson.
Plummer is enrolled in the School 
of Engineering, and Is generally re­
garded as being very able to pilot 
the Freshman class through their dif­
ficulties.

(By H. P. Rassbach.)
Yea Bo! Hot Dawn! Did anybody 
ever seo a better game of footbnll? 
The fightin’ Scotch were too much 
for the Pitt Panther. It was wonder­
ful. That one ?^ame had more thrlll3 
in it than a whole season of games.
No team in the country could havo 
defeated the Plaid team last Satur­
day. The Panther eleven was in the 
height of Its form. Every Tartan 
gridder played All-American football. 
At times several of them played a 
super-AU-American game.
“Hoot” FJanagan and Bohren of 
Pitt, did some great work for their 
team, in fact they were half of the 
show. However, they could go just 
so far—and no further. On these 
occasions they attempted forward 
passes, but due to the brilliant work 
of Jimmy Anderson they woro miser­
ably smeared. On two occasions 
Andy saved the day by ruining pass­
es which would havo meant touch­
downs for Pitt.
Oh, that wonderful second half! 
Two plays—one a touchdown. Here’s 
the dope. Pitt kicked off to Carne­
gie. Aftor the kick off Bon Kristoff 
hid in tho snake screen near the side 
lines. The ball was pasaed nnd be­
fore Pitt knew what was going on O.
B. Newman, tho man who mado Ala­
bama famous, had thrown the ball to 
Kristoff. Tho ancient “Shoo String" 
play had worked. Tho ball was on 
tho 15-yard lino. The ball was pasaed 
to none other than James A. Robert­
son. (IIo started around right end, 
was al-nost tackled whon ho reversed, 
and ran through a clear Hold for a 
touchdo.wn. This brilliant run proved 
once for all to tho 30,000 spectators 
that Jimmy Robertson is a rip-snort­
ing, fighting, brainy brilliant quarter­
back who deserves all tho praiso we 
can give him. Our hats aro off to 
Jimmy!

The Drama Depai*tment of Carnegie 
Tech is all set for an eventful year. 
The first real big play to be pulled 
off this semester is entitled “Magda," 
to be given in the Little Arts Thea­
ter. November 8 is student night, 
and tickets for that night will be 
obtainable at Dean McGoodwin's of­
fice November 5. Opening night is 
on Wednesday, October 31. The play 
continued every night at 8:15 through 
tlie next entire week.
In case you readers want a little 
inside dope on the plot of the story, 
open wide your ears and hear for 
yourself. “Magda” is a German 
drama written by Herman Suderman. 
It is a story of a very provincial 
German household of about 1870. 
Magdaline, the daughter of Joe 
Schwartze is turned out of his house 
for bearing an illigitimate child. The 
man concerned is Counsellor Von Kel­
ler. Magda, thrown out into the 
world upon her own resources, makes 
good on the stage and becomes a re­
nowned and famous opera singer. 
She directs a company of her own, 
and plays an engagement in her 
home town. Not being recognized by 
her parents, friends inform them of 
her appearance. She is persuaded 
to return home. Her father re­
quests her to marry Von Keller to 
avoid scandal. She goes to Von 
Keller. He makes very humiliating 
specifications, to which Magda does 
not approve nor agree. Her father 
being very narrow-minded, hears of 
this and locks her in his room with 
him. He declares that neither one 
of them shall leave the room alive 
if she does not marry Von Keller

in hand, ready to fire, something

During tho years of Carnegie Tech’s 
oxistenco, It has failed to devolop any 
insignia of recognition. Other 
schools have somo oinblom in tho 
form of a pin or button, which may 
oaslly bo rocognizod. In order to so- 
euro a doslgn truly representative of 
all Carnogle, the Alumni Federation 
has decided to hold a competition 
open to all students, Alumni and 
Faculty. Tho submlttod designs must 
bo drawn to such a scale that the do- 
tail will not bo lost whon they aro 
reduced to "button size,” which would 
bo about throo-oights of an inch In 
dlnmoter.
Tho four colors representing tho 
four collogos, with a “C” similar to 
tho ono on tho Thistle doslgn or any 
other idoa which is distinctly Car- 
riegle may bo used, but tho block “0” 
now used on tho Varsity Clan pin 
should not bo imitated. There will bo 
prizes awarded for tho host doslgn, 
ranging rrom two to fiftoon dollars 
oacli. Tho committee rosorvos tho 
right to rotain .any or nil of tho de­
signs, or to chango any dotails of tho 
accepted designs In making up tho

Tonight at 8:3.0 tho Newman Club 
makes its second splash in tho soa- 
son’s social puddle. In K. & B. jar­
gon, a dance is bein’ thrown by they. 
If the press agent’s reports can be 
believed, the K. of C. Hall at Fifth 
and Bellefield, is to be dressed up 
like father’s barn. But that does not 
mean that the patrons are to appear 
in the working apparel of a sturdy 
yokel. You may wear the clothes 
you now have on, provided you are 
not reading this In bed.
The Collegiate Imps will dispense 
some of the syncopated rhythm which 
makes even a cork foot itch for a 
hardwood floor. The committee has 
arranged some novelties that will re­
move the calculus creases from your 
brow.
An honest face and sixteen bits will 
get you by the door. Rain checks will 
be issued to those who leave fresh 
and unhappy. If you come early, you 
get more for your money. Use your 
business judgment!

M. M. STRINGERS ELECT 
OFFICERS FOR YEAR
On October 22, the Stringers com­
pleted their organizing. It was the 
first regular practice of the year, and 
at the meeting the officers for the 
year were elected, ny unanimous 
vote, Peg Coombs was chosen direc­
tor; Grace Broderick, manager; and 
Katherine Morin, secretary.
Janet Perry took charge of elec­
tions, and after they wero out of the 
way, a short practice was held, at 
which the girls went over a few new 
numbers. The club has been cut 
down a great deal, and only those of 
the highest ability were retained, so 
that the organization is now ready to 
begin what Is expected to be a very 
successful season.
After tho hard-fought battle with 
Pitt last Saturday, Carnegie football 
team is working hard In preparation 
for a similar (battle against Lehigh 
University at Forbes Field Saturday 
afternoon.
Tho Lehigh griddors have not been 
met for several yearB, but by past 
records, and the record of the visi­
tors so far this season, the contest 
will be about as hard as any in 
which tho Plaid has yet played. Tho 
Slcibo coaches know the 'strength of 
tho South Bethlehem griddors and 
are taking no chances by lotting up 
on tho intonslvo training program.
In past 'contests, Lehigh has always 
won over tho Tartans, but tilings 
havo changed slnco that time, and it 
tho PlaUl Is not handicapped by the 
crop of minor injuries resulting from 
tho Pitt gamo, a. lioalthy battlo should 
take plaoo.
Tho game is of particular interest 
because of tho now tradition of Fath­
ers’ Day at Carnogle Tech. Tho 
Fathers’ Day Commlttoo is working 
hard to malco this a success, and tho

SECRETARIAL CLUB TO 
OFFER SCHOLARSHIP
Although the Secretarial Club is a 
recent innovation in Margarot Morri­
son, it already has a definite ambi­
tion, a certain goal towards which to 
work. The girls have decided to give 
a scholarship of fifty dollars to most 
worthy girl In the department, upon 
entering her Senior year. The girl 
will be chosen from a standpoint of 
scholarship, personality, and whether 
or not she Is working her way through 
school.
Thus tho club will not only be help­
ing a fellow member but will also 
have an Incentive to become greater 
and bigger in every way.

Several vory prominent men visited 
Carneglo Tech last Tuesday.* A par­
ty consisting of Dr. S, Dowel, Presi­
dent of tho Alabama Polytechnlcal 
Institute, located at Auburn, Ala,; 
Hon. Victor II. Hanson, owner and 
publisher of tho Birmingham News; 
Hon. Erskine Ramsey, and John B. 
Davis, Dean of Engineering at Ala­
bama Institute.
Tho party spent tho day looking 
over tho school and inspecting the 
different departments. Mr. Ramsay 
recently made a liberal donation to 
the Auburn School for a now Engi­
neering Department and buildings. 
Tho party came here to get some 
ideas for the layout of their new 
project. It is their intention to 
model tho new department after thp 
Engineering Department at Carnegie 
Tech.
By Don Gardner
(Author of “The Purple Sloop or Tho 
Rubyalt.”)
In tho annals of history, compiled 
through many many yearB, it has boon 
common knowledge that tho English 
are a deleterious people. In other 
words, thoy aro slow. Only too true 
has this boon shown to bo by statis­
tics complied from statements -made 
by overly rapid cooklo pushers who 
have, at somo tlmo or other during 
their sacharJnous careers, boon 
"bored to tears, doncha know” by an 
evening with ono of the genus fom- 
inus Englandus.
It may have always been thus but 
It cannot bo everlastingly so for the 
never to be forgotten twenty-fourth 
of October we met (anyway we 
spoke) a charming winsome English 
lass with bright glowing cheeks at­
tired in a gleaming Packard creation
equipped with tho latest in wire 
wheels and whoso owner, no doubt, 
was trimmed by tho salesman. It 
seems she was none other than Miss 
Megan Lloyd George who is at pres­
ent touring America. She was accom­
panied by a vonerablo handsome old 
gentleman whom she Introduced as 
her fathor who had consented to ac­
company her on her expedition on one 
condition, namely that ho bo permit­
ted to visit Pittsburgh during tlie 
celebration of Father’s Day at Car­
negie Tech. His wish was granted 
and here ho was. ^everything waa 
complete but where were the festivi­
ties? After explanations that the 
event was to be held some ten days 
later and an invitation tendered for

TRIBUTE TO THE FLAG
The American and British flags occupied a prominent place in 
tho parade which was conducted through the campus last Wednes­
day in honor of David Lloyd George, ex-British Premier. The pa­
rade, led by tho Kiltie Bund was impressive but the ceremony lacked 
one. essential. Due respect to the American and British flags as they 
passed by was not paid by many of tho students and some of the 
faculty who viewed the array,
We feel that this lack of! homage to our national colors is not 
due entirely to disrespect, but rather to thoughtlessness or perhaps 
in some cases ignorance.
To one who has served his country faith fully this absence of 
tribute to our flag causes acute feeling. Let us then remember, wher­
ever and whenever it may be, to come to attention and to uncover, 
as the flag goes passing by.
A PLEA TO CARNEGIE MEN
Wo all know that the purpose of the Shilling is to provide really 
good literature for the campus, but do wc all do our part to accom­
plish this result'/
Just bocauso the editor-in-chief is a girl, tho men hang back and 
refuse to send in material. He broader minded.
Remember that a would-be member of tho staff must prove his 
¦worth before ho can bo accepted.
it is only a question ol! time beforo tho Shilling will bo a four 
school paper. All Carnegie mon arc asked to help tho day along 
by sending in material, for the nexity issue.

best in years. New nnd entertaining 
music has been selected and wonder­
ful progress has been mude at re­
hearsals. Somo of the members do 
not seem to realize, however, that 
they must attend all reharsals if 
thoy, wish to go on the trips and 
to earn their insignia. The rehear­
sals will be hold as follows: Glee
Club, every Sunday at 2:30 p. m., in 
the Exhibition Room in the Arts 
Building; Mandolin Club at the same 
time in the Union. It is not yet 
too late for men interested to try 
out as the members have not been 
definitely picked.
During the iatter half of November 
a smoker will bo held. At this time 
novelty acts or stunts will be given, 
the best one of which will bo modo 
a part of tho wintor’s program.

Montul tosts will bo glvon to tho 
Froshmon of Carnogle Tech on Octo­
bor 18. In view of this fact, tho De­
partment of Psychology was called 
upon to Btato somo of tho facts to Tar­
tan roadors as to tho purpose and 
value of such tests. Tho following in­
terview was furnished by Mr. Glon U. 
Clooton, who has recently bocomo a 
member of tho Psychology Dopart- 
mont.
It must be obvious to ovoryono that 
tho real purposo of any person enter­
ing upon a course of study in an in­
stitution of higher learning is that of 
tho successful completion of such a 
course. That many entering students 
complete less than a year of work in 
such courses opens a problem for se­
rious consideration. Within the past 
few years Departments of Psychology
GUILD MEMBERSHIPj 
DRIVE BEGINS NOV. 6
Annual Carnival Will be Held 
for the Purpose of Raising 
Settlement Funds
SCRAPS O’ PLAID
Tho Guild hi beginning to Bhow 
signs of being a live organisation, 
with MIbb Bonnoll, faculty advisor, 
and Mar tie Zimmerman, president. 
Its purpose tills year PS to acquire a 
Bound financial basis, In order to carry 
out the philanthropic purpose pro­
jected last year.
In 1912, whon tho Guild was first 
organized, it succeeded in establishing 
a lasting tradition, tho Annual Ba­
zar, which in tho last two years, has 
boon turned into a carnival, equal in 
fun and jollity to tho Mardl Gras. 
This affair usually takes placo about 
Chrlatmus time, and is characterized 
by representations of all tho depart­
ments of Margaret Morrison, and 
Arts. Last year’s Carnival, as ovory- 
ono will remember, was a decldod suc­
cess, with music, dancing, and stunts 
of extraordinary variety and ingenu­
ity.
Plans are being made tills year to 
make tho carnival a bigger and bettor 
event than over before. It will bo 
on December 8. Save tho date or 
you’ll bo sorry.
Tho Guild last year cleared over 
?500. This yoar, it plans to clear sev­
eral times as much in order tliat, by 
noxt year, it will be able to carry on 
tho work of establishing a Carnegie 
Tech College Settlement in tho For­
ward avenue slum district. This is 
the Guild’s aim, and tho firBt step to­
ward accomplishing tills ond is going 
lo bo a momborBhip campaign. Tho 
drive begins November G, next Tues­
day.
Don’t forgot tho day, November 6, 
and don’t forget your fifty cents.
The following chairmen of momber- 
Bhip committees havo been appointed:
From Margaret Morrison:
Adah Borgording, Hildreth Boug- 
hammor, Elizabeth Wright, Margaret 
McFolil, Annie Klnzer, Dot Wober, 
Hilda Anderson, Blanche Humphries, 
Mary O’Brien, Elizabeth Schwartz.
From Arts:
Ellon Elman, Jano Howard, Mary 
Francis Viall, EADS Lindsay.
all ovor the country have been asked 
to holp solve this problem.'
In considering such a problem it is 
well to ask the question, “What are 
tho factors involved in college suc- 
YRSSMo Anyone who attempts to 
answer this queBtion will find that 
there Is not moroly ono factor to be 
considered but many factors. Of 
these, several of tho moro important 
may bo stated:
1. Tho most important olomont in 
collogo success 1b admittedly native 
intelligence or mental ability.
2. Previous study and preparation 
plays an important part in tho sue- 
coss or failure of tho collogo studont. 
Mon tal ability or intellectual power 
of tho student In often moro potont 
than content. In view of tho atton-. 
tlon now boing glvon to tho problem 
of “content or achlovomont examina­
tion«” it is posslblo that wo shall 
know within a few yoars just what 
the minimum ossentials In informa­
tion are for collogo froshmon.
3. Character qualltlos, moral hab­
its and porflonallty traits aro further 
Indicators of probablo succoss or fail­
ure. At. BOmo future tlmo—yorhaps 
sooner than In now oxpocted—t,li0B0 
traits can and will ho adequately 
measured.
•I, Health conditions, both mental 
and physical, aro commonly known to 
inlluonoo the work of any studont.
H. Succoss In any course douhtloss 
depends upon tho proper choice of 
courses from tho standpoint of indi­
vidual Interest, aptitudes and special 
abilities. Tho lack of adjustment of 
courses both In tho amount of work 
undortakon and tho naturo of tho 
work handicaps many students.
tl. Worry ovor, financial, lntor-class, 
social and personal problems vory of­
ten makes a tremendous demand upon 
tho energy of individual students.
7. A number of other factors such 
as time spent in school activities, so­
cial affairs, recreation, amusements, 
working at somo occupation to earn 
expenses, commuting, etc., might be 
listed. A complete list would per­
haps include ten or a dozen items and 
would vary from student to student.
Since intelligence or mental ability 
is the most important of these factors 
it is advisable to secure a .relidble 
measure of that item for use in diag­
nosing problems where students are 
failing to adjust themselves to their 
academic load and are about to fail 
in their work. The first question that 
needs to be answered in such a case 
is “DoeB the student possess the 
mental ability to succeed?” If he 
does, it then becomes necessary to 
look among the other factors to find 
the troublesome element It can of­
ten be found and the difficulty solved. 
In this way the student may be saved 
an experience which might harmful­
ly influence his whole life career and 
tho faculty may he saved from an 
equally ombarrasslng oxporionco of 
foiling to holp a capable atudont.
That, intolllgonce tests do measure 
tho foremost olomont in collogo sue- 
coss has boon demonstrated by tho 
Columbia Unlvorslty oxporlmont 
which has boon oarrled on since 1019. 
Teats which aro used at Columbia will 
bo tho basio Item in tho Carnogio In­
stitute of Technology program of tost- 
Ing this yoar. In addition to tho tost 
scores just as much Information os It 
is possible to get will bo oolloctod on 
the other factors listed abovo. By 
this moans it is hoped that tho In­
formation socurod from tho tost 
scores may bo supplemented in such 
a way os to malco thom a sourco of 
holp to tho faculty ond stmlouts os 
woll.
Tho student should look upon the 
tests as being one of the means where­
by he can be assisted through a some­
what trying period in his college life. 
This being the case he should feel at 
ease and dispel any attitude of ner- 
Í vousness so that he can do justice to 
¡ himself in the tests
Did you ever notice the fact that 
after the individual In whose honor 
a parade is held passes a given point, 
tho Bpectators immediately begin to 
disperse? That’s quite natural. But 
did you notice on Wednesday that 
this immutable law did not hold with | 
reference to tho passing of Lloyd 
George? After tho third car behind 
tho statesman passed however, the 
crowd varied directly as tho distance. 
A reward is not offered to the perBon 
who guesBOB why the mob lingered un­
til this third car passed.
It is surprising to note the amount 
of Interest the Engineers aro taking 
in such an abstract thing as the up­
per classmen's entrance to the College 
of Engineering. Not infrequently, re­
marks are heard to tho effect that 
this particular college is In dire need 
of a more suitable and imposing en­
trance. Like tho now gym came, SR 
this improvement will come, perhaps.

COSMOPOLITAN CLUB 
TO HOLD MEETING NOV. 1
The Cosmopolitan Club will hold its 
next regular mooting on Thursday, 
November 1, in College Club, 143 
North Craig street, a!t 8:15. Tho Re­
vised Constitution as well as matters 
pertaining to the general wolfaro ot 
tho club will bo discussed. NamoB
for new membors will be proposed
and refreshments will bo served at 
the ond. All mombors and friends
are requested to attend and help in
tho diBcussions.
All now foreign students and others 
who Intend to bo members of the 
club are cordially invited to this 
meeting.
Let us all go and onjoy a good 
tlmo!
The R. O. T. C. cadet officers have 
been authorized to adopt the official 
dress, as stated in the regulations for 
membera of that organization. In ac­
cordance with tho procedure at the 
other institutions, where there are 
unlta of the R. O. T. C., and where 
tho regulation is carried out, the Ca­
det Officers at Carnegie Tech have 
received this authority.
The Bhoulder buttons, indicating the 
rank of commissioned cadet officers 
will be worn, and the significance is 
as follows:
Cadet Captain ..................Three Buttons
Cadet lat Lieut......................Two Buttons
Cadet 2nd Lieut....................One Button
In addition to the shoulder insignia, 
the corps has ordered the official Sam 
Browne Belts for the officers, and 
also tho leather puttees will be uni­
form.
This step is just another towards 
putting the unit at Carnegie Tech on 
a par with that at Penn State which 
is the best in tho country, and with 
'others who have ranked higher in the 
organization. Every little bit helps, 
and if the students will insist on “kid­
ding the army,” as it were, the Unit 
will help itself.
The following appointments as Ca­
det Officers and Non-Commissioned 
Officers in the Engineers, Motor 
Transport, and Signal Corps Compa­
nies are announced: Engineer Com­
pany, Captain, W. P. Knight; First

FOR THE GOOD OF CARNEGIE
On the shield of our Alma Mater 1 
we find the words "My Heart Is in the I 
Work.” The motto of the founder has 
also become the motto of Carnegie.
Living up to this motto on the part 
of the student, body is what has given 
Carnegie her, truly enviable reputa­
tion for spirit. The spirit of Carnegie 
is never more prominent than at the 
football games, but it is always with 
us here at the school and it goes with 
us when we go* out as it has gone- 
with the graduates of other years. It 
is that spirit Which enables alumni 
to create the reputation which the 
school has. “Ah!” some will say, 
'Now you are confusing football en­
thusiasm with interest in work.” The 
answer; of course, is that, fundamen­
tally, the distinction between these 
two is so vague as to be practically 
imperceptible, for what is the moving 
influence behind each? Enthusiasm, 
putting one’s heart and soul into it. 
That is why it is so hard for some 
people to understand why the bottom 
should drop out of a student’s exist­
ence just because the team lost a 
game. Those people have never 
known enthusiasm.
The motto of our Alma Mater is 
also tlie motto of most of her sons 
and daughters, but not of all. We all 
know there are among us here men 
and women who apparently cannot be­
come interested about anything con­
cerning the school. In some cases 
they are useful. They act as a brake 
to prevent our enthusiasm from at­
taching undue importance to things, 
but in most cases it seems a pity 
that they should be doomed to have 
such a drab and uninteresting out­
look upon life. They never know the
PROGRESS MADE IN 
GYM CONSTRUCTION
thrill that comes With achievements 
of the teams. They never know the 
feeling of pride when compliments are 
paid to the school. They have no 
emotions when the Alma Mater is 
played.
While we pity such people it is 
necessary FOR THE GOOD OF CAR­
NEGIE that we counteract them also. 
There is nothing more detrimental to 
getting things done than the presence 
of one or two of these pessimists. 
There are many things about our 
Alma Mater that are not as we could 
wish, but after all the situation will 
never be improved by harsh criticism 
and fault finding. If something occurs 
to you as being wrong, bring it to the 
attention of those that are in a posi­
tion to correct it. The old saw' of: 
“If you are pleased tell others, if not, 
tell us,” might well be placed in the 
offices of the administration.
Therefore, when you find something 
wrong about the school, dôn’t go 
around counteracting those that are 
boosting FOR THE GOOD OF CAR­
NEGIE. Make your efforts count pos­
itively, not negative. Shakespeare 
once said: "What is seen, depends
upon the eyes th'at see,” or something 
to that effect. If things don’t look 
right consult a heart specialist.
Yours, for the good of Carnegie.
Brick-Work Almost Finished 
—Floor Will be Ready 
for Basketball
ANNUAL M. M. SOPH-PLEBE
DANCE TO BE HELD FRIDAY
The work on the new gymnasium is 
progressing rapidly. According to the 
latest reports, the bricklayers will 
complete all outside brick work in the 
next ten days, and all the interior 
work within the next three weeks. 
Then will remain only the roofing 
and interior finishing.
The main gymnasium floor, which is 
on the upper end of the building and 
opens out on Tech street, iB well un­
der way. The women’s end of the 
gymnasium has moat of the brick 
work completed. The first and second 
floors which will be fitted up for club 
and locker rooms require only a few 
partitions and the finish. The third 
floor will be fitted up for hand ball 
courts and exercising rooms. The 
men’s end will be fitted up in a simi­
lar manner and is about at the same 
stage of construction.
The swimming pool is ready for the 
water proofing and tile, but these will 
be among the last things of the build­
ing to finish.
Due to weather and other uncon- 
trolable conditions it would bo ex­
tremely difficult to say just when tho 
building will be ready for occupation, 
but, it is almost sure of being ready 
for the coming basket ball season.
KILTIE BAND WELCOMES 
LLOYD GEORGE HERE
David Lloyd Goorge, War Premier 
of tho British Empire, was given a 
very enthuaiaatic welcome by the stu­
dents of Carnegie, when he passed 
over our campus. The Kiltie Band 
met tlie procession at the entrance 
to Schenley Parle and conducted it 
through the lines of students who 
thronged tho campus. To a Lloyd 
George accentor yell, tho great man 
responded with a very human smile 
of appreciation.
The Puppet staff claims equal hon­
ors- with the cheerleaders in produc­
ing the 'famous smile with which 
Europe’s greatest statesman greeted 
us. And, indeed, everyone is forced 
to admit that this is true, for every­
one saw for himself the latest edi­
tion of Puppet which Lloyd George 
clutched in his hand.
STUDENTS COMPLIMENTED FOR 
SHOWING TO LLOYD GEORGE
The following letter was receivod 
by Dr. Baker from the ‘Chamber of 
Commerce of Pittsburgh:
Dear Mr. President:
One of the pleasant and most sat­
isfactory features of the parade on 
Wednesday forenoon in honor of 
David Lloyd George was the assem­
bling of the students on the Carnegie 
Tech campus.
It was most gratifying to Hon 
David Lloyd George to have this cour­
tesy extended to him and, may I say, 
it was most gratifying to the officers 
of the Chamber of Commerce who 
had direct interest in the matter.
Yours sincerely,
A. L. HUMPHREY, 
President.

much anticipation and pleasure by 
both the classes. »
The Collegiate Imps are being se­
cured to furnish the music and an

While a certain number of college 
graduates find that the subject of 
employment is a serious problem 
after they have been handed their 
sheepskins, this is apparently far 
from being the truth when it con­
cerns the graduates of the Building 
Construction Courses at Carnegie. 
Most of the graduates of the build­
ing courses were signed up months 
before they were graduated; and rec­
ords show that at least four of the 
Carnegie men graduating last June 
are now with Pittsburgh firms.
Edward A. Haupt, a native Pitts­
burgher, who was graduated this year 
with a B. S. degree in the Depart­
ment of Building Construction, has 
joined the P. H. Kelley Company. 
Aaron Cr. Miller of Pittsburgh, a 1923 
graduate with a B. S. degree, is with 
the HfE. Miller and Sons Company 
Earl W. Liebermann of Ambridge, 
Pa., another B. S. degree winner lust 
June, is- now on the staff of thej 
Sheet Metal Works, in Ambridge.

Arthur W. Hed'gren, another Carne­

IT MUST BE TRUE
It says so in the papers. We saw it with our own eyes. To tho best 
of our knowledge we are not dreaming. But gosh, the ambition of a life­
time realized after an afternoon packed full of at least 57 different kinds of 
nightmares and heart-breaking moments—Oh, my! -What’s the use? If 
we’re dreaming, just don't do anything to wake us up.
Athletics are in full swing at M.
Hockey practice began last Thurs­
day on the football field, and al­
though some rather hard knocks were 
received, the girls are still enthusi 
astic.
As there will be no varsity basket 
ball th'is year, there will be special 
stress laid on class basket ball. Tho 
games will be played in the boys 
gym and will be open games. Great 
rivalry is expected between the class­
es.
All plans are now made for the A. 
A. Scholarship Dance, which is to 
be held in the Union November 23. 
BeBldds the regular dancing, an in 
teresting program will be given. 
There will probably be some refresh­
ments for sale, also.
EVERYONE BE THERE.

the personnel of the Men’s Dormitory 
Council. The corrected list follows:

Aftor many weeks or anxious Avail­
ing and a disappointment wo are go­
ing to soo tho Tartan Harriers in ac­
tion on Saturday. The squad starteu 
practice during tho first few weeks 
of school and have- slnco keep tho 
paths out through Schonloy hot 
GYory ovoning. Tho preliminary 
training has boon long and hard and 
we oxpect to seo tho team in a good 
condition for tlvolr run this Saturday.
Tho run will start anout 2:1 f* 
o’clock at tho bottom of Flagstaff! 
Hill, and wo oxpocl tlio usual llvo- 
milo course, only Instead of the run 
finishing in the Tech bowl, It will 
ond at Forbos Field. The run Is 
schedulod so that I lie runners will 
finish Just boforo tho Lehigh game 
starts. This will glvo every one
that is at tho Hold a chanco to soo
tho cross-country run, Varsity and 
Froshnion gamos.
Tho cross-country loam wns schod- 
ulod for a, practice 1 run with tho 
University ol’ Pittsburgh on Friday
afternoon, but Pitt failed to run for
unknown reasons. This makos us 
more anxious for tho moot on No­
vombor third.
Coach Guy Halforty was anxious 
for tills moot and somewhat disap­
pointed whon tho Pitt team fnlloil to 
run, bocuuBO ho was oagor to got a 
boLtor lino on tho men and also to 
havo the toam become accustomed 
to running with other men, bocauiio 
scovoral of the men on the squad 
havo novor run In moots boforo.
Trials woro hold Friday for both 
tho Proshmon and tho Varsity 
squads. Although the regular team 
has not boon piclccd tho following 
I mon will more than likely run: 
Dylconmn, captain; Bright, Hondoror, 
Klmmol, Foil or, Atwood, Gottwall, 
Liborknlght, Stull Ivan, Bonder and 
I Ward.
Tho Freshman toam also had a 
moot scheduled for Friday afternoon, 
with tho P. A. A. foam which failed 
to show up. Many good men aro 
showing up in tho Froshman sqiiad 
and we expect a victory In their 
run on Wodnesduy. It will start at 
tho bottom of (Flagstaff Hill and cov- 
or one lap of tho regular course and 
end at the same place.
Our Plebe team defended nobly tlie j 
honor of the school. Besides accom­
plishing a feat never before ptirfgrm-l 
ey by a Plebe or reserve team by 
tleing the strong Pitt Frosh by the 
score of 6 to 6, they established a 
record for all teams that have played 
on ForbeB Field.
The record was a 57-yard pass 
from Hamilton to Voght. On the sec­
ond scrimmage after the p^ss Harri­
son took the ball off-tackle for the 
touchdown which tied the score. 
The kick for the goal which would 
have won the game was missed.
The aerial attack by the Plebe 
team was superb. Besides the rec­
ord pass, Hamilton and Voght fea­
tured by completing a 30-yard and a 
35-yard pass.
Our line did well and the playing 
of Hughes, Cooper and Mam by is 
worthy of mention. On the whole/ 
tlie school can well be proud qC the 
Plebe team and its coach, Hugh 
Sprinkle, who deserves much credit 1 for the work he has accomplished.
Black and Preese played a good 
game for Pitt Froshes. To say that 
the game furnished all the thrills 
of a varsity game would not bo say­
ing too much. The moral support) of 
the students of both schools and 
the crowd coming early to obtain 
good seats for tho big game lent to 
the Junior game all the ear marks of 
the varsity game1.

THAT PITT SPIRIT
Showed itself at its best last Saturday, and it made everybody feel much 
better about the game that neither side showed any inclination towitrd un­
sportsmanlike conduct. Pitt did overything possible to make us foel that 
tho old breach had been honied, and we believe that our response was equally 
generous.
A new era in Pitt and Carnogle rolations has been borne amidst the 
blaring of trumpets, and the frenzied cries of rival rooters, and tho body to 
body contact of courageous warriors. This era has beon auspiciously ushorod 
In by the first victory that Carnogio has ever scored against tho University 
of Pittsburgh on tho gridiron, and it is up to us, who have been the victors, 
to keep that new fooling alive and ever fresh with the spirit of neighborll- 
uess, and good fellowship.
Men and women of Carnegie, let us not forget that our rolations with 
the Panther are of the most friendly sort, and that no reckless act or inad* 
vertant word on our part should mar the triumph which wo havo won.
. Pitt has shown good sportsmanship In defeat. Let us Show them that 
we can bo equally fine In victory.
HERE’S WHAT ONE OF OUR MEN SAYS 
‘‘The Pitt team was splendid. They played the cleanest game we havo 
been in this year,” says ono of tho varsity stars. Along fills lino, Hoot 
Flanagan has received some criticism for what lookod like unnecessary 
roughness when ho throw Robertson out of bounds. Tho straight dopo on 
this play IT that Flanagan wont up to Jimmy after tho play and apologized, 
saying: "I’m sorry, Jimmy; I didn’t know .you woro out of bounds.”
A school whose team is composed of such mon desorvos tho rospoct of 
its opponents.
SAME HERE
A young lover and uis love 'were 
attending church. When the basket 
was passed the young man explored 
bis pockets, and on finding in them 
that would pass as money, he whis­
pered to his sugar pie. '"I haven’t a 
red cent; I changed my pants.” 
Meanwhile . the dainty flapper, who 
had been searching her handbag in 
vain, blushed a rosy red and said, 
"Same here.”
TRY GLASSES
Professor—This iis the third time 
you’ve looked on Jones’ paper.
Frosh—Yes, sir; he doesn't write 
very plainly.—Beanpot.
WHY NOT SOME LITTLE REMEMBRANCE?
Aftor yoars of contlnuod ocort, tho Plaid has at lust triumphed ovor tho 
Bluo and Gold. Wo feel Lliat somo special tokon of honor Is duo tho toam, 
and that it would not bo amiss to givo each man a gold football In romom- 
brance of the occasion. When Washington and Jefferson was conquered 
several yoars ago, a somewhat similar spirit pervaded the atmosphere about 
Sclienloy Park. As a tokou of thoir grout light against the Presidents at 
that time, the team was prosontod with handsome gold footballs.
It Is oven more fitting that tho toam should now rocolvo somo article 
by which Lo remember tills great victory, and wo think it behooves tho Ath­
letic Council to considor seriously tho granting of gold footballs to the var­
sity squad.

of rooters to the Post Radio broad­
casting station. Thousands witnessod • 
the parade and radio fans throughout 
the continent remarked upon the ex­
cessive static emanating from the 
Pittsburgh district.
Sunday was a day of much trepida­
tion concerning events of the morrow, 
the general opinion being that there 
would be school, but no classes.
Ad to victory celebration
When news was received from Tom 
Griggs that upon interrogation, Doctor 
Baker had replied, "Yes, there will 
be no school,” and Dean Tarbeir had 
voiced similar sentiments, expedi­
tions were launched to serenade the 
girls’ dorms. The girls greeted them 
in kind and "Dear Old Tech” and 
‘‘Sweet Adeline-’ reigned supreme till 
way past midnight.
Monday’s activities started with 
anactlvated pep meeting in Langley 
Lab. at ten o’clock where Dr. Baker 
skillfully complimented Judge Steffen 
and Doc. Marks and applauded the 
excellent spirit shown, in which lie 
was heartily seconded by 'Buddy 
OveromJ.
Immediately thereafter the pep 
meeting proceeded on masso out to 
East Liberty, led by the Killies 
and followed by most of Pittsburgh. 
Frenzied cheering, blocked traffic and 
startlod burhers marked tho wake of 
to parade. Forsooth, ’twas a most de­
lightful morn’!
Tho Arts Ball, Junior Prom, and 
Mardl Gras thrown into one woro

spirited, affectionate and Joyour tea- 
danco hold In tho Arts Foyer and 
Union from two till six, attended by 
a record-breaking crowd of haj/py, 
celebrating students dancing to the 
soothing syncopation of the Colleg­
iate Imps and tho Tartans.
Tho climax of these celebrations 
came In the big bonfire last night 
which was fully as successful as any! 
of the previous events of this une­
qualled week-end.
Carnogio Tech’s fame In producing 
popular dance orchostras Is being up­
held this year with tho formation of 
a new orchestra composed entirely of 
active Carnegie students. It is com­
posed of six pieces and is known by 
the short, snappy Scotch name of 
"The TartanB.”
This orchestra is an entirely new 
aggregation and has no connection 
whatever with the "Tartan Entertain­
ers” of last year. Music was furnish­
ed by "Tlie Tartans” for tho opening 
football dance of this season, and the 
musicians have received many favor­
able comments on their work.
Vernon Olsen, editor-in-chief of the 
Puppet, has been chosen as manager. 
The six players are all active Car­
negie students, and consist of the fol­
lowing men: S. Rudy, D. Foster, H.
Smith, P. Joachim, Eppleman and V. 
Olsen.

PLAID VICTORIOUS OVER 
PANTHER IN HECTIC STRUGGLE
The following letter was received, 
last week. Some of those objecting to 
the new Alma Mater should read of 
this occurrence at one of Pitt's games: 
Editor of Tlie Tartan:
The October 16th issue of the Tar­
tan carried an article and an editorial 
on the question of establishing a new 
Alma Mater before the. Pitt game. 
The following occurrence will show 
the need for a new tune, at least, if 
not new words. During the Pitt-Syra- 
cuse game, at the Yankee Stadium, on 
October 20th, I became acquainted 
with a Cornell man who sat in the 
next seat. Between halves, the two 
bands marched to the center of the 
field and Pitt’s played their Alma 
Mater. Immediately afterward, Syra­
cuse played theirs—the same tune! 
With a snort of disgust the Cornell 
man exclaimed, “That’s the tune of 
my Alma Mater also,” and he added, 
“I guess there isn’t even a high school 
that doesn’t have it.”
This little incident should illustrate 
the necessity for a change—by all 
means let’s have it at once!
Yours trUly,
EDWARD M. GRETZLER, .
Sec. New York Carnegie Clan.
Plans for the four concerts to be j 
given this year by the Carnegie Sym- j 
phony Orchestra indicate that music ¦ 
lovers will be treated to something; 
finer than has ever before been at- ‘ 
tempted by the organization.
An unusual number of new players j 
have entered this year and no doubt \ 
Concert time will find from ninety to j 
a hundred students rehearsing regu­
larly with the orchestra.
With the new talent and much of; 
last year’s talent remaining, Mr. j 
O’Brien believes that the concerts this j 
year promise greater success than j 
those of the past.
Last year two public rehearsals j 
preceded each of the four concerts j 
which the public and high school pu- j 
pils of Pittsburgh were invited to at- j 
tend. The impression created by the 
orchestra at these rehearsals, and the i 
benefit th© orchestra itself received,! 
have led Mr. O'Brien to adopt tills j 
policy again this year. The dates of j 
the concerts as well as the dates of 
the public rehearsals will be an­
nounced in the near future. All of 
the concerts and public rehearsals 
will be held in'Carnegie Music Hall.
Ralph K. Merker, whom some of 
the alumni will remember as a 
teacher in the School of Industries, 
has forsaken the industrial for the re­
ligious.
Rev. Merker was called to the 
Manchester Church at a salary of 
$3,000 a year. He has been assist­
ant in the church since his gradua­
tion from Western Seminary in 1922, 
and during his course gerved in the 
same capacity directing the music.
Mr. Merker taught industrial sub­
jects at Morganza as well as at Car­
negie.
He was installed October 16. It 
only goes to show that all Carnegie 
men don’t turn out to be engineers 
and architects.

with his usual ease. From then on

somewhat fast. And so we have an 
English girl who is exceedingly on 
tho job and not In the least bit slow 
about doing her stuff.
Ih connection with the arrival of 
the party we had a long talk with 
ono of the happy mediums of the gang 
who gave us this glimpse into the fu­
turo.
“I Bee” he said in a drunken (gut- 
toral) tone “a vast bunch of men and 
college students wending thoir way 
through tho famous portals of tho 
school in tho background, for it is tho 
morning of Fathers’ Day and an in­
spection trip (no write-up) is being 
held. The scene changes and they 
partake of luncheon in the Commons 
and then wend their way to a grid­
iron contost, the final score of which 
will be —$*—%?*$ (printers' error). 
Again the scene changes and tho 
group Is gathered in the Commons. 
A gang of ribald roisterers enter and 
provide mirth for the assemblage, af­
ter which each student takes his 
father in hand and conducts him to 
the dance or theater as he desires. 
And thus each grand old man receives 
an insight into the surroundings and 
character of the greatest boy in the 
world and becomes a boy again him­
self and mutual love and respect are 
inculcated in the two. That is all, 
but sad will be the man who must 
shame facedly admit that he sent not 
an invitation to his father. So be it.”
We started as he awoke from his 
trance (we still have our trousers) 
and were forced to admit he had the 
dope. His parting shot as the chauf­
feur stepped on the gas was a quota­
tion from Joe Spivis’ “Boy” as fol­
lows :
Bring your Dad to the Brewery Ball
He won’t have a cent to pay—
As the glasses clink we will merrily 
drink
To our first annual Fathers’ Day.
