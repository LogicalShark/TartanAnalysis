A new policy on postering 
by student organizations has 
been announced by the Stu­
dent Activities Office.
The most significant aspect 
of the policy, which takes ef­
fect Thursday, is that organi­
zations will be limited to three 
posters per event on any one 
bulletin board.
Other rules restrict the size 
of posters to a maximum of 11 
by 17 inches, require groups 
to place their names clearly 
on posters, and prohibit pos­
tering on walls, windows, and 
other similar areas. Banners

“The photos consisted of center­
fold type pictures, which graphi­
cally illustrated women mastur­
bating and couples engaged in 
sexual activity.... The victim 
stated that he was upset and of­
fended by [the] pornographic 
material taped onto and around 
the door frame leading into the B- 
300 corridor of Doherty Hall.”
This is part of the Carnegie 
Mellon police report filed in re­
sponse to a performance piece 
done by graduate student Matsuo 
Mayumi on Thursday. The pic­
tures were allowed to remain as 
part of Mayumi’s project study on 
prostitution.
The incident comes at a time 
when censorship in the arts is at 
the forefront of national news.
U.S. Senator Jesse Helms is at­
tempting to bar federal money for 
“obscene or indecent art,” in reac­
tion to two exhibitions financed 
by the National Endowment for 
the Arts (NEA): One included 
Robert Mapplethorpe’s “ho­
moerotic” photos, and the other 
Andres Serrano’s photograph of a 
crucifix submerged in urine.
In response to Helms’ proposed 
amendment, an ad hoc commit­
tee, Speak Out Against Censor­
ship, was formed in Pittsburgh. 
The committee presented a pub­
lic program Friday evening at the 
University of Pittsburgh’s School 
of Law.
The program was advertised as 
a “citywide event to educate the 
public and make a visible stand in 
defense of our right to freedom of 
expression.” Eleven speakers

The plan to largely consolidate 
off-campus housing through the 
purchase of Centre Plaza Apart­
ments appears to be in jeopardy 
in light of quality and financial 
questions surrounding the build­
ing.
“At this point, my sense is that 
we're not going to purchase Centre 
Plaza Apartments,” says Direc­
tor of Housing Anthony Martin.
Though a final decision has yet 
to be made, says Oscar Mayer of 
the Business Affairs Office, “from 
everything we anticipate, I would 
say that the chances of us buying 
the building have certainly de­
creased.” He says that concerns 
related to the quality of the 
building’s construction and addi­
tional expenses that could be 
incurred by its future owners seem 
to preclude any serious consid­
eration of purchasing the build­
ing.
Mayer says that the final deci­
sion on the purchase of the build­
ing lies in the hands of the trus­
tees, who would have to approve 
it.
Questions surrounding Centre 
Plaza’s construction raised the 
issue of long-term financial feasi­
bility. “Some economies seem to 
have been taken in construction 
[of the building],” said Martin.

VP Rogers accepts 
Cornell position
By MATTHEW RUBEN
Special to The Tartan
After fifteen years at Carnegie 
Mellon University as an adminis­
trator, Vice President for Busi­
ness Affairs Frederick A. Rogers 
announced Thursday that he has 
accepted the post of Treasurer 
and Vice President for Finance at 
Cornell University in Ithaca, New 
York.
The culmination of a nation­
wide search, Rogers’ appointment 
was approved by the Cornell 
Board of Trustees last Thursday. 
The position officially belongs to
Rogers as of July 1. The appoint­
ment was announced in a coordi­
nated effort by the public rela­
tions offices at Carnegie Mellon 
and Cornell.
“As much as I’d like to stay,” 
says Rogers, “this new position 
represents a great opportunity 
and challenge for me.... As a 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus, I’ll 
always feel part of the University 
... [and] as a Pittsburgher, I’ll al­
ways feel close to the city.”

Friday’s opening of the CMU Women’s 
Center marked the beginning of what some 
on this campus hope will bring strength 
and unity to the women of Carnegie Mel­
lon.
“We want to make sure that women are 
aware of and are able to take advantage of 
those opportunities that they are entitled 
to,” says Heather Hood, a fourth-year 
architecture student and one of the organ­
izers of the Center. “For many years, 
women have been adjusting to a male- 
dominated education and leadership sys­
tem with generally unequal response. 
Sometimes, this adjusting becomes unex­
pectedly challenging for women.”
Women are a minority at Carnegie 
Mellon — the ratio of seven men to three 
. women is the butt of many attempts at 
humor, but usually the jokes suggest the
difficulty of a man finding a date. That’s 
not the only problem that such a ratio 
creates, though.
“Sometimes,” says Center organizer 
Viviana Rennella, “it’s very lonely and 
scary.” Rennella says that sexism is not 
something foreign to the Carnegie Mellon 
campus.
The classroom situation can be tense for 
women. Hood points out that women are 
less likely than their male counterparts to 
talk in class. “There sometimes exists a 
difference between the way people are 
treated academically and socially,” she 
says.
“A professor or a classmate will say 
something,” explains Center organizer 
Daniele Wilmouth, “and you know that 
it’s not quite right but you don’t know 
why.” Wilmouth explains that the Center 
will be able to help women cope with that 
kind of feeling by helping them evaluate

- Because of a complaint by one of the vendors who has licensed 
' a database for use on Carnegie Mellon’s Library Information
System, users wishing to use the system from outside of the 
libraries will be required to have a password.
According to Mark Kibbey, who serves as director of automa- 
' tion for University Libraries, the development of the computer 
'network linking Carnegie Mellon’s computers to users across the
- country has result in a problem in that many of the databases 
; available “on-line” are site-licensed for use only at Carnegie 
¦' Mellon. Allowing any user to log onto the system using the net is
a violation of the site-licensing agreement.
On February 15, a password will be required to use LIS from 
private terminals. Any user from the CMU community may 
obtain a user name and a password by filling out the application 
that is on-line in LIS. Users having an electronic mail address 
with a .cmu.edu suffix will receive their user name and password 
via electronic mail. In most cases, the user name will be the same 
as the person’s Andrew user name. Users without an electronic 
mail address may arrange to pick up their user name and 
password by presenting a valid Cameeigie Mellon I.D. card at 
one of the libraries circulation desks.

Professors Simeon Frediberg and Ned Vander Ven were in­
jured in an automobile accident early last week. A vehicle moving 
towards CMU on Wilkins made a left turn onto WIghtman and 
struck the professors as they were crossing at the intersection.
The two men were in the crosswalk when they were hit. 
Friedberg was flung to the ground where he landed on his back. 
Vander Ven was knocked down in front of the vehicle.
Pittsburgh Police and paramedics arrived on the scene shortly 
after the accident. The two men were transported to Presbyterian 
University Hospital in Oakland where they were treated and 
released. Both suffered from bumps, scrapes, bruises and lacera­
tions; in addition, Vander Ven also suffered a broken leg.
Both Friedberg and Vander Ven have returned to their offices 
in the Physics Department since the accident.

A cancelled room reservation has led to a dispute between 
WRCT and the Activities Board as well as a Student Senate in­
vestigation of claims made by WRCT that AB is not adequately 
responding to the needs of CMU students.
According to WRCT General Manager Brian Welker, a room 
reservation secured by WRCT for a dance was cancelled without 
the group’s knowledge. WRCT could not reschedule the dance.
Welker said that this situation arose because AB is difficult to 
communicate with for the coordination of events, and is unre­
sponsive to student needs.
Rob Bethge, AB chair, said that his organization was not re­
sponsible for cancelling the reservation. The room, reserved by 
both AB and WRCT, was released when AB told Student Activi­
ties that they had no plans for the room. Bethge didn’t know 
whether WRCT was contacted.

Bush proposes 
$1 billion aid to 
Panama
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi­
dent Bush proposed Friday to 
provide more than $1 billion to 
help Panama recover from the 
U.S. military invasion and years 
of corrupt government, U.S. offi­
cials say.
The aid program, announced 
Friday, will include development 
aid, loan guarantees and pro­
grams to encourage investment, 
said one anonymous official.
About half of the program will 
be in cash and the remainder in 
credits, the official said.
Yesterday, Bush told a news 
conference he was determined to 
“try to help — repair the wounds, 
repair the damage.”
“I mourn the loss of innocent 
civilians in Panama or anywhere 
else,” Bush said. “But you have to 
look at the broad picture ... and
then you’ve got to do what’s right.”
The official said the admini­
stration hopes other countries, in­
cluding Japan and western Euro­
pean nations, will follow the U.S. 
lead and make contributions of 
their own.
The administration is still talk­
ing behind the scenes with lead­
ers of Congress about the Pan­
ama aid package.
Parties agree 
to cease fire in 
Soviet province
MOSCOW (DJ) — The Tass 
news agency reported that in 
negotiations, the Armenian All- 
National Movement and the 
People’s Front of Nakhichevan 
had agreed to stop fighting.
“According to the agreement... 
along the entire border between 
Armenia and the Nakhichevan 
Autonomous region all exchanges 
of fire between opposing informal
groups must stop.”
Tass said the cease-fire was to 
start at 4 pm Moscow time Fri­
day, but did not say whether 
shooting actually had stopped.
U.S. unsure of 
substance found 
in Noriega home
WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
Pentagon Tuesday retracted 
claims that American soldiers had. 
found a large cache of cocaine in a 
guest house used by General 
Manuel Noriega.
“It was not cocaine,” said Pen­
tagon spokesman Bob Hall. 
However, he could not identify 
with any certainty what the sub­
stance was.
An anonymous Pentagon offi­
cial said the substance had been 
found wrapped in banana peels 
and “has something to do with 
voodoo.” The Washington Post 
reported that the find amounted 
to tamales used in voodoo.
Havel expresses 
hopes during 
trip to Hungary
BUDAPEST (AP) — President 
Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia 
told the Hungarian Parliament 
that the purpose of his visit to 
Hungary was “to coordinate out 
steps for our return to Europe.’
Havel’s trip followed a visit last 
Thursday to Warsaw during 
which he proposed that Czecho. 
Slovakia, Poland and Hungarj 
work in unison to reintegrate 
themselves in Europe as politi. 
cally independent states.
During a brief address to par­
liament, Havel expressed the hopi 
that “the Prague Parliament, too 
will soon be a real parliament, 
with a strong and intelligent 
opposition sitting across from me 
in the chamber.”
Czechoslovakia’s first fully 
democratic postwar elections are 
scheduled for June.

In last week’s issue [“ ‘Favored candidate’ may stay at Stan­
ford”], Faculty Search Committee Chair John Fetkovich was 
quoted as speaking to The Tartan about the “favored candidate,” 
but never referred to any candidate by name, as the story may 
have implied. The Tartan identified Stanford’s Jim Gibbons as 
that candidate through other sources.
Colombian 
jetliner crashes 
near JFK
COVE NECK, N.Y. (AP) — 
Investigators said preliminary 
indications suggest that a Colom­
bian jetliner that crashed Thurs­
day night,- killing at least 67 of 
158 people aboard, had run out of 
fuel, a source close to the probe 
told the Associated Press.
Avianca Flight 52 was carrying 
149 passengers and nine crew 
members when it crashed in heavy 
fog and rain on its second ap­
proach to John F. Kennedy Inter­
national Airport, the airline said 
in a statement from Bogota.
The source close to the investi­
gation, who spoke on the condi­
tion of anonymity, reported the 
probers had said the pilot notified 
the Kennedy tower that he was 
low on fuel before he tried to land 
the first time.
But he aborted the landing, 
telling the tower that he was 
having trouble with his number 
two engine and that the cloud 
ceiling was too low — 200 feet.
The source said that besides
the lack of fire or fuel odor, addi­
tional evidence that the plane ran 
out of fuel was seen in the low- 
impact, low-speed crash, “mean­
ing the plane glided in, did not 
come in nose first and shatter 
into a million pieces.” Also there 
was the fact that the nose, wings, 
and body came down level instead 
of thrusting forward, as it would 
have if the engines were running.
Aviation sources who visited the 
scene and spoke on condition that 
they not be identified said the 
Boeing 707 should have been able 
to make its landing even if just 
one engine retained fuel.
Boeing spokesman Tom Cole 
said the 707 model is capable of 
carrying about 24,000 gallons of 
fuel, which gives it range of 6,000 
miles. “It has plenty of capability 
tofly from Colombia to New York.”
Bush raises 
ante in war 
against drugs
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi­
dent Bush Friday proposed a 
national drug control strategy for
1991 that includes a budget of
$10.6billion, al2percentincrease 
over current spending of $9.5 bil­
lion.
The strategy also designates 
five regions: New York; Los Ange­
les; Miami; Houston; and the 
Southwest border of California, 
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas 
—as high-intensity drug traffick­
ing areas eligible for millions of 
dollars in additional help this year 
and in 1991.
The document, released by the 
White House in advance of a 
speech by Bush, is an updated 
version of the strategy he pre­
sented last September.
Bush’s updated strategy does 
not represent a change in goals.
It says the fundamental prin­
ciple remains unchanged: “To 
make drugs undesirable and hard 
to get through a mix of supply and 
demand policies.”
The strategy emphasizes “the 
crucial role that state and local 
governments play — and must 
play—if a national drug strategy 
is to work.” To that end, it calls for 
$2.6 billion in 1991 to be sent to 
the states for law enforcement, 
treatment and drug prevention 
efforts, a 108 percent increase over 
the past two years.
EPA may be raised 
to cabinet status
WASHINGTON (DJ)—Several 
White House officials wantto raise 
the EPA to cabinet status.
Presidential spokesmanMarlin 
Fitzwater told, reporters that, the 
matter was discussed, but that 
the president hadn’t made a final 
decision.
The spokesman said that mak­
ing the EPA part of the cabinet 
could have “managerial advan­
tages.”
Bush has said he doesn’t want 
to add to the size of the cabinet. 
But Fitzwater said, “Occasionally 
there may come up reasons why 
we’d want to change our mind."

Starting this month, Carnegie Mellon 
will offer its first undergraduate pro­
gram in computer science, a three-year 
mathematics/computer science course, 
created jointly by the School of Com­
puter Science (SCS) and the Mellon 
College of Science (MCS).
Designed for entry in the sophomore 
year, the program is intended to prepare 
students for graduate study or careers in 
fields in which computer science is im­
portant.
The program consists of four compo­
nents —mathematics, computer science, 
science, and technology and humanities. 
It’s built around a moderate-sized core of
required courses on which students can 
tailor their own specialized curriculum.
According to SCS Dean Nico Haber- 
mann, several course selections are de­
signed so students can emphasize a 
particular area like computer architec­
ture, software engineering, theory, or 
mathematical computation. One track is 
specifically designed for people who want 
to go to graduate school. “We hope to see 
everyone who is interested and offer all 
courses each semester,” Habermann said.
Although MCS has offered computer 
science tracks in chemistry, physics, 
mathematics, and biological sciences for 
as long as four years, the computer sci­
ence school taught the courses primarily 
as a service.
“Now,” says Habermann, “we are fully

involved in developing curriculum, ad­
vising students and offering a much 
broader array of subjects, including arti­
ficial intelligence, language design, and 
verification of logic.”
The school of computer science will 
establish an office for student advising
and record keeping. Revisions of curricu­
lum and academic policies will be handled 
jointly by SCS and the science college.
“While we have excelled at computer 
science on the graduate level, we felt it as 
a lack in our organization not to have an 
undergraduate program to match,”
Habermann said.
About 100 students presently enrolled 
in the Mellon College’s computer sci­
ence/math track will feed into the new 
program. In the future, students may 
enter through MCS or Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology. After taking a gen­
eral first year, they will declare the CS/ 
mathematics major. Students will be 
required to take core courses identical to 
those for existing MCS programs
“This is a first-class undergraduate 
program that will give students who qire 
really interested the mathematics ajid 
logic end of computer science,” s&id 
Mellon College of Science Dean Robfert 
F. Sekerka. “It shows how the units at 
Carnegie Mellon cooperate to develop 
strong interdisciplinary programs.”

Conviction in computer 
virus case fails to sway 
CMU policy or officials
By NATE LOOFBOURROW
Tartan Staffwriter
Robert Tappan Morris, a Cor­
nell graduate student, was con­
victed last Monday of federal 
computer tampering charges 
under the Federal Computer 
Fraud Act ofl 986. Morris released 
a computer program known as 
the “Internet Worm” November 
2, 1988, which infected and dis­
rupted computer systems all over 
the country. Under that act, he 
may receive up to five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. His 
sentencing will be held in Febru­
ary.
Carnegie Mellon students were 
unlikely to notice the worm’s re­
lease. CMU machines were 
“barely affected” by the virus,, 
according to Director of Comput­
ing Systems Bob Cosgrove. “The 
Andrew system was unaffected,” 
says Cosgrove. The “trap door” 
through which the rogue program 
entered most systems was known 
about four years ago. “Before 
anyone tried, we had closed off 
the trapdoor,” said Cosgrove. As a 
result of this “most careful” ac­
tion on the part of members of the 
Information Technology Center,

there was no break in, merely a 
slowdown in performance, accord­
ing to Cosgrove.
Although the worm itself “dis­
rupted CMU computers for less 
than a day”, Cosgrove called the

Quality concerns quash purchase of Centre Plaza
gHuM8uCIa 3AH4 irsI f
Mayer agreed, adding, “If what I see as 
an untrained layman is consistent 
throughout the building, then it leads 
you to say “let’s get a professional to look 
at it.’ ”
Architect Louis Gilberti, who worked 
on the renovations to Boss and McGill 
Halls, examined the building for CMU. 
Gilberti himself refused to comment on 
the building.
Though the architect’s final report on 
the building is pending completion, 
Martin said that his findings indicated 
that the entire exterior surface of the 
building may have to be replaced within 
10 years. More immediately, a retaining 
wall is being replaced which collapsed in 
the foundation of the building.
There were also some fundamental 
questions as to whether the structure 
was suitable for use as a residence hall. 
'The standards to which the building 
was constructed are not dormitory stan­
dards,” said Mayer.
If purchased, Centre Plaza could house 
as many as 200 students. Martin says 
such a purchase, along with the space 
created by the new dorm, could enable 
the University to eliminate off-campus 
apartment rentals.
“We still want the opportunity for 
upperclass students to be able to select 
off-campus housing,” Mayer adds.
Since the new dorm will satisfy much 
of the need for additional housing, plans 
for next year include a reduction in the 
off-campus apartment rentals. In addi­
tion to the University-owned Shirley 
Apartments on North Dithridge Street, 
the University will continue to rent 
Hampshire and Tudor Halls, as well as 
the Carol, Shirley, Marybelle, and Fairfax 
Apartments.
Gone for next semester, however, will 
be the other Fifth Avenue Apartments, 
as well as the 630 Clyde Street and 
Centre Plaza Apartments — overall, 
about half of the Oakland-Shadyside 
apartments. Those students currently 
living in these areas will be given prior­
ity in the housing selection procedures
over all othermembers oftheir class. For 
example, currentfreshmenlivinginthese 
areas will be given priority over other 
members of the current freshman class 
and next year’s incoming freshmen.
Because the new dorm, which should 
become operational in September after a 
year of delays, has a capacity of 300 
students, the loss of 150 off-campus 
spaces is not expected to be a problem.
“The aim,” says Martin, “is to have all 
freshmen and as many upperclassmen 
as possible on campus, and to provide 
adequate space for those who choose to 
live off campus.” In an effort to make the 
Tudor and Shirley Apartments more 
appealing to upperclass students, the 
one bedroom apartments in those facili­
ties are being reclassified for 2 students, 
rather than three.
Martin hopes that the new dorm will 
solve many of the problems the Housing 
Office now faces. Each semester, many 
students are unsuccessful in seeking on- 
campus housing. “It’s difficult to assess 
what our total demand is,” he said. “I 
suspect that we might have had more 
upperclassmen apply for housing if they 
knew they’d get it. We put their names 
on a waiting list, and the waiting list 
didn’t move — I think a good number of 
students didn’t even bother. This will be 
the first time we can at least look to 
offering housing to all the students who 
want it.”
Currently, Centre Plaza is being 
managed by Prudential Realty, and is 
owned by Kolton Enterprises Inc., the 
real estate subsidiary of Dollar Bank. 
The bank took possession via a deed in 
leu of foreclosure from the original owner, 
which was a mutual agreement with the 
original developer of the building in order 
to avoid foreclosure for failure to make 
payments on the construction loan.
Although the University is not the only 
party interested in the building, it has 
nevertheless been given priority. “We 
have received requests for information 
on the building by other entities,” says 
Paul Witkovitz, vice president of Kolton. 
“We have not followed up on those enti­

ties because of our involvement with 
Carnegie Mellon.”
Since its acquisition of the building, 
the bank has begun remedying specific 
problems and making improvements, 
such as adding extra sound-deadening 
material in the corridors and rebuilding 
the sprinkler system. The bank is cur­
rently working on rebuilding the retain­
ing wall.
Although he would not give a specific 
figure on Dollar Bank’s investment in 
the building, Witkovitz did say that it 
was “well into six figures.”
“The bank has been very diligent in its 
attempt to identify and correct all the 
problems,” says Mayer.
Aside from financial concerns and 
questions about the building itself, 
however, Martin said that the More- 
wood Shadyside Civic Association — a 
local neighborhood group — suggested 
they might oppose the rezoning of the 
apartments to accommodate 4 people, 
when they were originally designed for 
3. In an informal meeting with then-Vice 
President for Business Affairs Fred 
Rogers, local residents expressed their 
belief that allowing such a zoning change 
would be “setting a bad precedent,” ac­
cording to Martin.
The association is the same group that 
voiced opposition 4 years ago when CMU 
began renting the 3 Clyde Street apart­
ment buildings. After approximately 8 
months of deliberations, the University 
finally reached an agreement with the 
group. Under the terms ofthe agreement 
reached with the group 3 years ago, the 
University agreed to phase-out the Clyde 
Street Apartments, conduct regular 
meetings with community representa­
tives to discuss problems and concerns, 
and investigate the possibility of con­
structing a new dormitory.
Martin said that the agreement was a 
factor in the decision to build the new 
dorm. The group later reconsidered the 
issue of 618 Clyde Street Apartments, 
however, saying it believed the Univer­
sity had been a positive influence.

Special Business: Last year, 
WRCT organized a concert called 
Winter Blast. Over 200 CM. stu­
dents attended, as well as other
non-university people. WRCT 
wanted to work with AB to organ­
ize a similar event this year, and 
needed approxiamately $1000 
funding. Arrangements were 
made for WRCT to have the Ball­
room on Feb. 24. AB decided not 
to give them the Ballroom, as some 
AB members would be in Chicago 
that weekend. WRCT could have 
held its annual dance instead 
without the help of AB. Without 
notifying WRCT, AB cancelled the 
concert and gave the Ballroom to 
another group. WRCT wants to 
know why it is having such diffi­
culty communicating with AB, 
and what can be done to rectify 
the situation.
AB responded that the room 
was reserved, and that there was 
miscommunication between the 
two groups.
Floor questions:
What should Senate do about 
this?
What are a groups options when 
a reserved date is cancelled?
There is no waiting list proce­
dure. Mr. Murphy called the whole 
incident a mistake, and said that 
WRCT will be put in a priority 
situation for cancellations.
There was also discussion about 
the damage done to Grey Matter 
by cigarettes, as well as alleged 
syringes found in the bathroom.
MOTION to postpone discus­
sion until AB and WRCT can get 
together to work through their 
problems.
This motion yielded to the pro­
posal to appoint a student task 
force to look into the Activities 
Board as it is an external commit­
tee of Senate.
MOTION to call the question.

DISPUTE, 5:10 pm. A female student 
living in Morewood Gardens D-Tower 
complained to Campus Police of a vio­

to the student and her roommate and 
learned that the man had leftthe room. 
According to the two women, an Asian 
man that had been using her bathroom 
became very upset when she opened 
the bathroom door after she had 
knocked and received no response. 
They said that he then came into their 
room and was extremely upset and 
vocally abusive. The man then alleg­
edly spat in the face of one of the room­
mates. The suite-mate of the two 
women stated that she had heard the

1/25 OFFENSIVE MATERIALS,
8:37 am. A CMU graduate student said 
that he was upset and offended by porno­
graphic pictures taped on to and around 
a door frame in Doherty Hall. A respond­
ing officer found the photographs and, 
judgingthey were easily viewed by pas- 
sersby, removed them. A professor later 
stated to the officer that the pictures 
were part of a graduate student art proj­
ect and they should’t have been removed.
The pictures and student were to be 
filmed in a video about prostitution. A 
Carnegie Mellon Police sergeant and 
an investigator responded to the scene 
. Acting Dean of Student Affairs Mi­
chael Murphy said the project could 
continue. The original officer apolo­
gized to the student who owned the 
pornographic materials for removing 
them.

outside buildings will be permitted but 
must be removed within 48 hours of the 
event they advertise.
Organizations which violate the new 
policy will be fined $5 per offending poster 
or banner. They will also be charged for 
the cost of banner removal if necessary. 
Organizations which fail to pay their 
fines will not be allowed to use the bulle­
tin boards the following semester.
The policy “was primarily a [Student] 
Senate resolution and then modifications 
by [Assistant Director of Student Activi­
ties] Bonnie Gorman,” according to Stu­
dent Government President Mark Mit- 
telhauser. Gorman said that Senate had 
been bothered by the fact that overpos­
tering by organizations was making it 
impossible for students to read any but
the most recent posters on bulletin 
boards.
Gorman said that the limit on poster­
ing will also save money since organiza­
tions will not have to print as many 
posters to compete for student attention. 
“I think it’s an effort to try and help 
organizations communicate their events 
more effectively,” she said.
Mittelhauser is satisfied with the pol­
icy. “I think that it accomplishes what 
we set out to do,” he said. ‘The fine seems 
a bit excessive but I guess for the pur­
poses of compliance ... it’s necessary.”
Organizations who want to have their 
posters placed on the boards in Grey 
Matter will be required to submit two 
posters for each event to the Information 
Desk. The posters will be placed on the 
boards by Student Activities employees.

that kind of situation.
“Most of us feel that we can take 
advantage of any opportunity,” 
says Hood: “The Center is aimed 
at people who would have a diffi­
cult time and who are seeking a 
supportive and comfortable envi­
ronment.”
Rennella explains that the 
Centerwillbe different from other 
places in the University where 
women might go for help in deal­
ing with their problems. “Coun­
seling and student affairs are open 
to everyone for everything,” she 
explains. “Women aren’t neces­
sarily comfortable to talk about 
their issues there."
Hood notes that talking to 
people in the Women’s Center 
doesn’t bear the stigma that 
sometimes accompanies counsel­
ing. No actual counseling will be 
done at the center, btit the staff of 
the center is prepared to make re­
ferrals for professional assistance 
when necessary.
The Center, locateij in Marga­
ret Morrison Plaza, will operate 
daily as the Center andnightly as 
Morrison’s Lounge.
The Women’s Center was the 
result of a proposal drafted last 
April by Debbie Barkunand Anne 
Marie Harvey, both numbers of 
the Women’s Issues Collective. 
Those who have worked to make 
the Center a reality hope that it 
will provide an informal atmos­

phere in which women can learn 
how to cope in a traditionally 
male-dominated society.
“The English Department is 
very interested in gender-related 
issues,” says Rennella, “but you 
have to take a class to take advan­
tage of what they do. We’re hop­
ing to provide that information 
out of the academic setting.”
While some of the problems that 
women face on CMU’s campus 
are related to the environment 
itself, others are not. Rennella 
attributes the low number of 
women in engineering and sci­
ence to home experiences in which 
women are not given support.
In addition to providing an 
environment in which women can 
come together and support each 
other by sharing their experi­
ences, the CMU Women’s Center 
will serve as a meeting place for 
several groups that either help to 
provide women with support or 
that work to organize women’s
events. Among these are the Soci­
ety of Women Engineers, Women 
in the Arts, the Campus Associa­
tion for Abortion Rights, CMU 
OUT, Women’s Alcoholics Anony­
mous, and the group that the 
Center grew out of, the Women’s 
Issues Collective.
Workshops and self-defense 
classes are also planned for the 
Center.
The organizers of the Center 
feel it’s important to dispell the 
illusion that the center will be 
exclusive. “Everybody’s welcome 
to come and learn,” says Ren­
nella. “It’s not going to be a 
women’s secret club.”
Initial response to the Center 
has been favorable. Over 100 
people attended Friday’s open­
ing, and many expressed interest 
in the activities of the center.
Juniors Anne Whidden and 
Tara Noone both expressed hope 
that the opening of the center 
would help to foster an environ­
ment in which women feel more 
as if they belong.
“I think the problem is that 
there is not that much unity on 
this campus,” said Whidden. 
“Women who are from different 
colleges or different departments 
don’t have the chance to get to­
gether and to get to know each 
other. I think that women have a 
lot in common just because 
they’re here, but they normally 
don’t have a chance to talk about 
it.”
Noone agreed. “If it serves it’s 
purpose,” she says, “it’ll get a lot 
of support from women on this 
campus who want to seek it or at 
least see that we ought to have 
some sort of unity. We are a 
minority, and it’s ego-battering to 
be the only woman in some of 
your classes. There’s some kind of 
unspoken solidarity of which you 
just don’t feel a part.”
Acting Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy feels the center 
will help to address needs that 
have existed on CMU’s campus 
for a long time. He praised the 
students involved for their work 
in the Center. “The vitality of a 
college campus — of Carnegie 
Mellon — is in efforts like these.” 
Among those other individuals 
making highly involved in organ­
izing the Center were Mary 
Bowman, Lina Hoshino, Jodi 
Isaacs, Harriet Protos, and Julie 
Tomljenovic.
Censorship and the arts: Who draws the line?

addressed the near 200people in attendance 
on a variety of differenl issues. The common 
thread connecting these speakers were, as 
Master of CeremoniesMoe Seager put it, “a 
.sense that somethin; has gone foul, that 
.something undemocntic is going on in cen­
sorship of the arts.”
Notable speakers ii the program included 
.Barbara Wolvovitz, executive director of the 
American Civil Liberies Union; Tom Murphy, 
Pennsylvania stat^ representative; Elaine 
King, associate professor of art at Carnegie 
;Mellon; and Jessies Caplan, a junior art stu­
dent at CMU, knovn for her controversial 
performance piece )f flag burning on the Cut 
¡in November.
Craig Hosay, president of the National 
Lawyers Guild ai the University of Pitts- 
'burgh, spoke of dgression of America in the 
face of eastern prigression. “Here in the U.S. 
we’ve seen a risiig tide of censorship while 
Stalinist regimes are falling like dominoes,” 
ihe said.

in front of a slide projection of a photograph 
titled A Man in a Polyester Suit. The photo­
graph depicts the midsection of a man in a 
suit with his penis in full view. It was this 
picture that Helms claimed was “homoerotic.”
Austill, who is gay, described the picture as 
one representing beauty and power, and com­
pared it with the Michaelangelo’s David. He 
questioned the difference between the two, as 
the statue is a nude, and Michaelangelo is 
widely considered to have been gay.
Jessica Caplan spoke about the reaction to 
her performance piece, Humbling the Flag. 
Caplan was kept from burning flags from
several different countries on the Cutlastfall.
She identified herself as “a victim of censor­
ship,” describing her piece as a form of “sym­
bolic expression” designed to stimulate the 
“exchange of ideas.”
Representative Tom Murphy usedthe movie 
Dead Poet’s Society as an example of encour­
agement to further “the romance of ideas and 
imagination,” as well as to combat apathy. It 
is important, Murphy said, “to challenge 
professors, ask them why we have to do it that 
way, have them explain themselves.” He 
warned, “If you eliminate romance, we’ll all 
have McDonald’s as art.”

dealt with.” Tie code of ethics, 
which may be found in the Stu­
dent Handbook, describes CMU 
students’ “two basic rights: pri­
vacy and afair share of resources.” 
“CMU is no. going to... fix the 
i problem of conputer mischief in 
¡law or policy,”says Director of the 
.Center for Deiign of Educational 
Computing Preston K Covey adds 
that CMU camot fix the problem

puter abuse?”
Covey maintains that “We need 
our code of ethics, but more than 
that we need education... to help 
people make judgements in hard- 
choice situations.”
But, Covey streeese the harder 
question, “How do we educate 
people to use good judgement... 
before they cause harm?”
Covey has organized a confer­
ence in cooperation with the
National Science Foundation to 
discuss codes of ethics governing 
computer resources. “The point 
of the conference is to bring to­
gether policymakers, computer 
scientists ... philosophers and 
social scientists.”
Covey feels “partly happy that 
Morris was successfully prose­
cuted,” in the sense that the courts 
did not view Morris’ program as 
“a kid’s prank.” On the other hand, 
he expressed concern that Morris 
might receive a greater punish­
ment than the case really merits.

VP Rogers resigns
gHuM8uCIa 3AH4 irsI f
Richard Cyert praised Rogers’ 
ability to “take an extremely 
heavy workload... and perform 
amazingly well with it.”
James Morley, Jr., Cornell’s 
senior vice president, calls Ro­
gers a “nationally recognized 
leader in university financial 
management.”
AssistantDean of Student Af­
fairs Ron Campana observes 
that Rogers “never forgot this is 
a community of all different 
types of people.”
University administrators 
inevitably see his replacement 
as a challenge. “There will be a 
major position to fill, with an 
impressive level of vigor and 
dedication to the job, the va­
cancy resulting from someone 
with those qualities,” says Os­
car Mayer, Rogers’ administra­
tive assistant. “Issues of conti­
nuity and consistency for the 
university will become impor­
tant. It will probably lead to or­
ganizational reconsiderations.” 
Mayer denies that “issues of 
continuity and consistency” will 
mandate that Rogers’ replace­
ment come from within CMU, 
but he added that “Fred has as­
sembled responsibilities and 
made a great number of com­
mitments from the University 
that he understands, but inevi­
tably anythingthat has his per­
sonal imprimatur on it will not 
look the same to his successor.” 
Campana says Rogers will be 
“hard to replace,” and adds, “I 
think it speaks well of him that " 
at such a young age [40] he 1 
could get such a hot position.” 
Campana feels Rogers’ ap­
pointment “speaks well of CMU 
—that Cornell would come here 
as part of a national search.” 
What Rogers departure 
means to Carnegie Mellon in ’ 
light of the impending end of 
Richard Cyert’s presidency,’' 
however, remains unclear.
“I don’t know what it means,” 
says Campana. “It’s one ofthose 
personal things, that most ex­
ecutives always have their ear 
to the ground, and this oppor­
tunity came up. Personally I 
don’t think it had anything to 
do with the change in leader­
ship. Fred doesn’t have to run 
away from anything.”
After receiving his bachelor’s 
degree in mathematics from 
Carleton College, Rogers 
earned a master’s degree from 
Carnegie Mellon's School of * 
Urban and Public Affairs in 
1974.
Subsequently he became a 
planning analyst for the uni­
versity, director of planning and 
administrative systems, and 
finally Vice President for Busi­
ness Affairs.

WcENTÌRÌ
YOU ARE 
HERE
qH4IupE QIuMIA
Here’s an experiment you can 
try — no lab certification needed. 
When you walk around campus, 
stop for a minute and count the 
people passing you.
At least two thirds will be male.
Women are a minority at CMU. 
In last year’s statistics from the 
Admissions Office, the numbers 
are cold and clear: the freshman 
class of 1248 students has only 
374 women, less than 30 percent 
of the total. Freshman men out­
number women more than two to 
one overall, with the ratio ranging 
from near-even in CFA’s fresh­
man class to almost 6-to-l in CIT’s.
Keeping these numbers in mind, 
it’s probable that women at CMU 
face pressures and problems that 
might not be apparent to the 
“typical” (read: male) student.
The CMU Women’s Center may 
be able to help change that. By 
providing a haven for discussion 
of women’s issues without the 
pressure of minority status, the 
Center can help women confront 
the problems of being women in a 
male-dominated university. In the 
Center, women don’t have to worry 
about feeling like an object. They
r iHE8M8.I EMIi
don’t have to feel intimidated by 
being the only female in the room.
The Center is more than just a 
place to feel comfortable and less 
alienated from a male majority 
attitude. There will be workshops, 
self-defense classes, and other 
services for women.
The Center will provide a meet­
ing place for women’s groups, for 
women’s events, and for the 
women who need them. There’s 
now a place on campus where 
women can find help with gender 
specific problems — as opposed to 
somewhere in the phone book.
The Center shares its space with 
Morrison’s Rec Room, which takes 
over operations when the Center 
closes at 8 pm. This arrangement 
will allow the space to be used as 
a lounge while keeping the Cen­
ter accessible during the day.
With the addition of the Women’s 
Center, Carnegie Mellon is ad­
dressing the needs of a minority 
that has gone relatively unrecog­
nized for years. It is a sensitive 
and considerate action, and one 
that we applaud as an appropri­
ate step towards a University that 
treats all its students like people.

Students need University Free Time
Some student problems at Car­
negie Mellon never go away. In­
stead, the students do •— eventu­
ally.
Case in point: University Free 
Time. No undergraduate classes 
are to be scheduled between 4:30 
and 6:30 pm on weekdays. Ever.
That rule was intended to be a 
big step towards a better quality 
of student life when it was created 
during the 1987-88 school year.
Students should have a time 
each day for other forms of educa­
tion — non-academic ones, like 
athletics, club meetings, and 
Greek dinners.
President Cyert and Vice Presi­
dent for Enrollment Elliott have 
proven their commitment to Free 
Time. When they have received 
reports of infractions, they have 
moved to eliminate the problems 
as best they could.
We contend that they shouldn’t 
have to be the enforcers.
For example, The Tartan’s edi­
torial board meets onWednesdays 
at 4:45 pm. It’s not a new meeting 
time; we’ve had it for a year.
But this semester, one of our
board members has a class from 
4:30 to 5:30 pm. Trying to sched­
ule the meeting any other time is 
impossible—between production 
constraints and other board mem­
bers’ legitimately-scheduled 
classes, we’re unable to come up 
with a better time.
That’s why we scheduled the 
meetings during Free Time in the 
first place.
When they find themselves with 
classes in Free Time, individual 
students are unlikely to complain. 
They risk being labelled “trouble­
makers” — and no grade is ever 
completely objective.
If part of our education is to 
come from outside the classroom 
—say, putting out a student news­
paper — then faculty who sched­
ule classes during Free Time are 
advancing our academic educa­
tion at the expense of the rest ofit.
It’s like putting one foot on the 
gas and the other one on the brake.
We’re calling for faculty mem­
bers to get a handle on the bigger 
picture of the University’s educa­
tional mission — and pull our 
classes out of free time.
Editor:
I am writing in rc 
sponse to the article “
‘Losing touch with re­
ality’: Trippin’onLSD 
at CMU,” [12/5/89].
The article was unfortunately skewed 
in presenting only negative aspects of 
LSD use on campus; moreover, it also 
contained some gross inaccuracies re­
garding the physiological and psycho­
logical effects of LSD.
Most astonishing of all were the state­
ments of Sergeant William Ricci of the 
CMU police. He stated the “[LSD] stays 
with your neurological system, makes 
genetic alterations, and causes birth 
defects.” While it is true that LSD, if 
taken by women in the first trimester of 
pregnancy, can cause an increased inci­
dence of miscarriages or congenital 
defects in the newborn, it has not been 
shown to cause genetic damage under 
any circumstance, nor does it stay in the 
body for longer than 24 hours. I quote 
the following from the current Encyclo­
pedia Britannica (from articles entitled 
“Drugs and Drug Action” and “Alcohol 
and Drug Consumption”):
All the hallucinogens are relatively 
nontoxic ... No deaths in humans 
have yet been attributed to mesca­
line (or any of the hallucinogens)...
A new dimension was added to the 
LSD controversy when laboratory 
studies began to appear in the scien­
tific literature that linked LSD to 
chromosomal and genetic damage.... 
Unfortunately there remains only 
the poorest understanding of exactly 
what has been found, to date, in 
such studies. The findings are nei­
ther clear nor conclusive, and more­
over they involve not only LSD but 
also several classes of drugs in rather 
common use, such as aspirin, caf­
feine, tranquilizers, and antibiotics 
... If the gene pool of the LSD user is in 
jeopardy, as these studies suggest, 
then, the gene pool of the whole popu­
lation is also in jeopardy, as these 
studies also i
The Britannica also states that “with 
LSD most of the drug is degraded and 
excreted within several hours, although 
small quantities may be present for as 
long as 12 hours.” Thus, LSD does not 
“stay with your neurological system.” 
While it is true that occasional prolonged 
psychotic reactions have been associated 
with the drug, there is evidence that 
these reactions occur mainly in subjects 
who are already ill before they take hal­
lucinogens, and these unusual reactions 
last at most several months, not the “ten 
years” that Sergeant Ricci stated.
Another misconception that the article 
furthered is that LSD is a much more 
dangerous drug than pot (THC) and 
mushrooms (psilocybin). The freshman 
interviewed, “Frank Martin,” had decided 
to stop taking LSD and stick to pot and 
mushrooms, presumably because he be­
lieved LSD to be the most dangerous. In 
fact, LSD is physically the least toxic of 
the three; marijuana in particular in­
creases the risk of lung cancer when 
smoked. As to the psychological effects, 
once again quoting the Britannica, “sub­
jects are unable to distinguish among 
LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin when they 
have no prior knowledge of the identity of 
the drug ingested.”
The Tartan has a responsibility as a 
student newspaper to present objective 
and factual information about drugs, not
propaganda that is designed to scare 
people into abstinence. One particular 
danger of such propaganda is that people, 
having been told that a drug such as LSD 
is extremely dangerous, may discover 
through either their own experience or 
that of a friend' that there are actually 
few deleterious effects; they may then be 
disinclined to Relieve factual informa­
tion about drugs that are truly quite 
harmful, such is crack or PCP.
If the Tartan wishes to write an objec­
tive article aboi^t LSD use on campus, I 
suggest more careful research of the topic; 
from what I haveseen, the average LSD 
user at CMU is creative, open-minded, 
and far more likely to be sitting in front 
of a computer screen watching scintillat­
ing fractals and thinking about philoso­
phy and four-dimensional geometry than 
having anything resembling a “bad trip."

Editor’s note — j 
sionals agree that j 
more serious than these of marijuana or 
mushrooms.
According to Anita iarkin, director of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Student Health Serv­
ice, LSD is by far the most potent and 
dangerous of marijuaia, mushrooms, 
and LSD. LSD stays in'.he system longer 
than any other halludnogen and can 
produce panic, psychotc reactions, and 
visual hallucinations, awording to Craig 
and Stitzel’s Modem Plarmacology.
Spontaneous reoccu.rn.nces, known as 
“flashbacks,” of sensations experienced 
while under influence of LSD, including 
periods of psychotic behavior, can occur 
for a lengthy period oftin\e following the 
actual intake of the drug.

Editor:
Spring is a great 
time of the year, espe­
cially in Florida. Our 
weather is beautiful, 
and it’s the perfect 
time to visit our beaches and other 
pleasant attractions. Our cities and resi­
dents are ready to welcome you with 
open arms.
At this time we want to remind you, 
that while we hope you enjoy your spring
vacation, you must be aware of laws in 
Florida that may directly affect you.
We ask that you respect our “21” age 
drinking law. It is illegal for anyone under 
age 21 to possess, purchase, or in any way 
obtain alcoholic beverages.
It is against the law in our state for the 
driver or passengers of a motor vehicle to 
possess an open container of alcohol. 
Thousands of people die each year in 
alcohol-related crashes. We do not want 
you to become another statistic.
Spring break can be a jiyous vacation 
filled with sun, sandy beaches, and ; 
friends. Too many times, instead, ittums i 
tragic. Only you can conirol how your i 
vacation will end. We wan; you to return 
to your schools and families safe and 
healthy. So please, drive sober, and don’t; 
ride with anyone who has been drinking, j

The Faculty Senate and the admini­
stration have been working to develop a 
university policy on harassment. On the 
surface, this seems like a good thing. 
Obviously, whatever the policy is, it will 
be designed to protect students, defend 
their rights, and clear up the ambiguity 
about what is and what is not allowed on 
campus.
But there is a grave danger hidden 
here. Under the seemingly benevolent 
guise of protecting the individual 
members of the university community, 
a wide-ranging harassment policy could 
become a powerful tool of those who 
would legislate morality and could be 
used to stifle freedom of speech.
The well-meaning people in the Fac­
ulty Senate and Student Affairs don’t see 
things this way. They want to make the 
University a comfortable place for all. 
“We want no group to feel excluded,” they 
say. “We want no student to be marginal­
ized.” Noble ideas. But there is a terrible 
danger in legislated morality. Where does 
one draw the line? “Racism and sexism,” 
they will say. “Intimidation based on 
sexual preference or religion.” Something 
along the lines of the university anti-dis­
crimination statement.
While these seem like rational bounda­
ries, they are too grey, too vague, and too 
open to interpretation. An angry epithet, 
we can agree, would be harassment. But 
what about a well-argued thesis that can 
be interpreted as racism? Would a profes­
sor who believed and taught aspects of 
Nietzsche’s theories be guilty of harass­
ing his or her students? Would a student 
who argued against feminism in class be
harassing his or her classmates? What 
about the student who believes in apart- • 
heid? Or the professor who is religiously 
opposed to gay-rights legislation? Are 
their arguments harassment?
As a university community, we must 
take a stand against anything but a very 
limited harassment policy, for moral as 
well as practical reasons. A catch-phrase 
around all universities is “academic free­
dom,” not freedom of speech, freedom of 
opinion, freedom to attempt to influence 
others to agree, or freedom to disag 
with the majority. Academic freedom is 
what American universities are founded 
on.
Sometimes we may not like this. We 
want to tell those we see as bigots to shut

Axe falls hard on sexual offender
Irtnnfhan I <q64gAuHAg KEvQ
Some readers may remember 
that last semester I compared the 
Pittsburgh City Council to a cir­
cus. At the time, I thought having 
circus act running the city was 
bad thing, but I have since come 
to realize that the situation could 
be worse.
Circuses are fun and usually 
harmless. You see the clowns 
squirt seltzer at each other, a few 
stunts, some animals, and every­
body goes home entertained. It’s 
essentially City Council with a 
tent.Recently, however, at least one 
government agent in this state 
has taken the fun out of incompe­
tence.
When you were young, your 
mother probably told you many 
times “It’s fun until someone gets 
¡hurt.” Some people in this state 
ineed to learn that reactionary, 
attention-grabbing solutions to 
complex problems are ceasing to 
be funny and are becoming dan­
gerous.
Last week Gilfert Mihalich, a 
Westmoreland County judge sen­
tenced a convicted rapist to prison
with the recommendation that the 
man should be paroled only if he 
was castrated, either surgically 
or by chemical means.
Mihalich claimed he wanted to 
send out a tough message to po­
tential criminals and to the state 
legislature about how rapists 
shouldbe punished. I suspect that 
what Mihalich really would have 
liked to send out was a press 
packet.
Mihalich has gotten a tremen­
dous amount of publicity, some of 
it bad, but next time he runs for 
re-election, or election to a higher 
office, people will recognize his 
name.
Injudicial elections where most 
people do not know the candi­
dates, any name recognition will 
go a long way. Some people will 
vote for Mihalich simply because 
they have heard of him. Others 
may actually agree with what he 
did.
What he did, though, is very 
irresponsible and dangerous for 
at least two reasons.
The first is that castration as a 
penalty for a crime or a condition 
for release is barbaric and proba­
bly unconstitutional. Cutting off 
the testes of a sex offender is on 
the same level as cutting off a 
thief s hand.
This and similar penalties have

beenusedthroughout history and 
are still used in some countries, 
most or all of which we tend to 
look down upon as being uncivi­
lized.
The United States has a consti­
tutional prohibition on cruel and 
unusual punishment for a good 
reason. It is supposed to prevent 
the government and its agents 
from imposing excessive or inap­
propriate penalties for crimes or 
singling out individual criminals 
for extreme punishments. The 
penalty suggested by Mihalich 
was cruel, unusual, and shouldbe 
struck down on appeal.
Another reason why this sen­
tence is dangerous and irrespon­
sible is that it is based on the 
assumption that rape is a sexu­
ally motivated crime. However,

there is a large body of evidence 
suggesting that it is a crime moti­
vated by a desire to commit vio­
lence or exercise dominance over 
another person.
If this is the case, castration 
serves no purpose. Jf the rapist is 
cured of his anti-social inclina­
tions, the state of his testes should 
have no influence on whether or 
not he gets parole. If he is not 
cured, parole would be a mistake 
even if he were castrated. He 
attacked his previous victim sexu­
ally but if he is deprived of the 
ability to commit sexual assault 
he may just use a baseball bat 
next time.

Stress can cause problems for everyone
The weather in Pittsburgh is 
strange. Any place that can 
manage a 30 degree temperature 
difference on a January day can 
have effects on people. They get 
sick, they get depressed, they get 
stir-crazy.
I guess some people here can’t 
stand the climate. Walking back 
from Morewood late Saturday, I 
passed a crowd. I didn’t like it — 
it had*too many official people in 
it, had the swarming look of ants 
on a dead bug. The whole place 
felt of tension, as if someone had 
crossed a carefully guarded line. I 
squelched my curiosity and 
walked on — sometimes it is bet­
ter not to know.
I got the story later, though. My 
friend Skinner burst into my room 
early in the morning, acting like 
some animal way past the break­
ing point, something headed full- 
bore towards oblivion. He popped 
in gaunt, wild-eyed, and scream­
ing. He was unshaven, wild-eyed, 
and jabbering at 110 mph about 
rules, conformity, and the tyr­
anny of the majority. I knocked 
him down, had him sit, and forced 
a beer into him. I needed to slow 
him down before I could figure 
out what happened. I readied 
myself for a long night of babysit­
ting.
His story came out quickly, 
savagely.
“Skinner, you were responsible
z4g 9rnhEuu
for that crowd last night, weren’t 
you?”
He had a hunted look, like a 
deer staring into oncoming lights. 
“Yeah, yeah. But I had to, man, I 
just couldn’t take it anymore, this 
place, these people. I mean, man, 
he just couldn’t relax, couldn’t 
stop....”
“Calm down! Now, what hap­
pened? Where’s your roommate?”
Silence. Then, slowly, some 
calm returns, and he fills me in on 
a story that would make an iron- 
hearted man weep.
“It happened Saturday night, 
about 9:45.1 asked my roommate 
if he wanted to go see the 10:00 
movie. He said no, that he should 
work instead. Grades, you know. 
Then, as there wasn’t a whole 
bunch going on that night, I asked 
him if he wanted to try the 12:00 
showing — I mean, it was a good 
movie.
“But he told me that was too 
late — he had to get up early to 
make it to Hunt to study before 
the crowds arrived. He doesn’t 
like studying with all those people 
around — makes him nervous. 
Doesn’t really like people around 
at all.
“So, I sat there and thought, 
and I realized that every time, I 
mean every time, I had asked him 
to do something, every time, eve­
rything, he had been busy. He 
was always working. He had been 
out socially maybe once or twice. 
Other than that, all he did was 
study and work. I don’t even know 
if he slept. Just work.”
Skinner’s voice kept going up 
the scale, getting higher, more 
stressed. He had a nasty aura 
about him.
“I mean, he got mad at the idea 
that I would go out instead of 
studying, that I saw college as a 
place to have some fun, instead of 
as a factory for producing effi­
cient workers. He really got mad. 
I backed off — no need pissing 
him off. I grabbed my coat, and 
told him to relax, calm down a 
little.
“That was a mistake. It seemed 
the word ‘relax’ really pissed him 
off, that the idea he might spend 
time not working was antitheti­
cal to his definition of himself. I 
backed off — I’d never seen him 
this mad. ‘Relax,’ he screamed, 
‘Fall behind? You want me to sac­
rifice grades, just to go out and 
have some fun? I’ll have fun later
— college is for work! Remember, 
Andrew Carnegie said *My heart 
is in the work!’ Well, yours should 
be!’
“I turned and tried to get out
the door, but he got me, started 
beating me, yelling about QPAs, 
15-127, about always being the 
best. He really came at me, and 
attacked me with a Physics book. 
1300 pages. Damn. I hit back with 
the first thing I could find, a refer­
ence guide to Indian Metaphys­
ics. He didn’t stand a chance. 
Knocked him through the win­
dow, and onto the ground, five 
stories below. I’ve been on the run 
since.”
Skinner stopped, looking physi­
cally hurt with the remembrance. 
“I didn’t mean to kill him — we 
got along great. I just wanted him 
to go to a movie, relax a little, not 
place so much importance on 
grades and work. They’re after 
me now. They’re mad at me. I’ve 
killed one of their best students, 
and they’re raving about how 
much money they put into him, 
about how much he would have 
brought on the job market, about 
how much prestige he could have 
brought to CMU. I don’t think I’m 
safe here.”
I let him sleep in my room that 
night, then gave him what I could, 
and watched him go into the morn­
ing mist. He said that all he 
needed was time to relax, a sched­
ule that wasn’t quite so stressful, 
and he’d be fine. I believe him.

Cellular phones give their owners a new (but not necessarily good) image
Like so many people, Robert 
Shoun acquired a cellular phone 
in 1990. This came as a surprise 
to his friends because Shoun hates 
phones and never answered his 
calls in the past. There is no doubt 
that Bob is enjoying his new toy. 
I know this because he called me 
four times in one day.
“How is everything with you?” 
he wanted to know.
“That’s a stupid question, Bob. 
Why are you calling?”
“I got this new car phone and I 
have to ring somebody.”
“You never telephoned when I 
needed you,” I told him. “Now I 
hear from you all the time.”
Bob sounded defensive. “Can I 
help it if I prefer to call from my 
car? I just don’t like doing it from 
the office.”
“If you have to talk to someone, 
why don’t you try calling your 
wife?”
“She isn’t taking my calls any­
more. She took her telephone off 
the hook two weeks ago.”
“Surely you have some busi­
ness buddies you can get in touch 
with,” I said.
“I do,” he answered. “But most 
of them are putting me on hold. 
They figure anyone who calls from 
a car phone doesn’t have much to 
do. Give me a break — talk to me
eMu DonHIAaN
for the next three blocks.”
“I ran out of things to say after 
you went through a red light on K 
Street last week. Bob, you should 
have thought of how many people 
would answer your calls before 
you bought the telephone.”
“I did, but the ones I counted on 
let me down. You would think 
they’d be eager to converse with 
someone who was gridlocked in 
front of the White House.”
“They are, but sometimes your
phone fades out on them, Bob, 
and that can be very annoying.” 
“Who told you that my phone 
faded out?” Bob asked.
“Michael Kahme. He said that 
every time you ring him up, you 
pass a dead spot and he can’t hear 
a word you’re saying.”
“He’s just making it up. I am 
known to everyone because of the 
clarity of my calls.”
“Bob, I have to go. Joe Califano 
is calling me from his car and he 
gets nervous when I leave him 
hanging.”
“It’s okay with me. I’m going to 
be busy. I have to dial the weather 
service and then 911 and after
that the 800 number to order cut- 
rate Pavarotti records.”
“You’d be better off forgetting 
the phone and listening to your 
radio.”
“You don’t understand, a cellu­
lar phone has to be used. I keep 
looking at it and I know that there 
is someone out there waiting to 
hear from me. Maybe I’ll call in­
formation in San Antonio.”
“Do you know anyone in San 
Antonio?”
“No, but it would be nice to find 
out how many Shouns live in 
Texas.”
“Tell me, Bob. Have you ever 
made a call that couldn’t wait until
you reached the office?”
“I don’t think so, but I’ve made 
many to people who were terribly 
impressed when they found out 
that I was calling from my car. 
Once you have a phone in your 
automobile, others respect you 
for who you really are.”
“That’s probably true. Can I go 
now?”
Okay, but you better take my 
car number if you get the urge to 
talk to me.”
“Why would I want to do that?” 
“To thank me for using AT&T.

Just when you thought it was 
safe and you would finally be able 
to face a Monday with your head 
screwed on right, you didn’t wake 
up to your alarm. And then when 
you went to eat at the Tartan 
Grill, you shoved a lid on your cup 
of soda (or, if you prefer, pop), 
only to have it fall off when you 
picked it up for a little sip, thereby 
emptying the soda onto your lap. 
On top of all that, a mischievous 
little man decides that it is high 
time he pays you a visit, since you 
refused to meet with him when he 
initially wanted to.
You could have had the upper 
hand if you went to the original 
meeting, since you knew he was 
coming to see you. But now that 
you haven’t, and have made him 
angry, he has the advantage.
This time, he has secretly 
employed millions of tiny clones 
that look just like him, and do 
exactly the same thing he loves to 
do: aggravate the hell out of you. 
And, to make matters worse, they 
take you by surprise when you 
least expect it (or at least that’s 
the way it was in my case).
Oh, how I despise this man! He 
makes my life so difficult. There I 
was, an innocent, harmless crea­
ture, when, all of a sudden, he
chose me to be his next vict... er, 
client. If I do not obey him, I risk 
being taken from the school. If I 
do follow his instructions, how­
ever, I will be bedridden forever, 
trying to ease the pain of lus tor­
rid touch.
I always feared the day that I 
would have to meet with him, 
even though he makes pretty fair 
deals with just about everybody. 
But I was not ready for him, and 
he knew it. He decided to knock 
on my door for a personal visit 
just as I was about to fall asleep 
after my last class of the day.
“Are you the one I have been 
looking for?” he asked me (he 
didn’t know what I looked like 
since I had eluded him the first 
time). There was no way I was 
going to win, no matter what 
answer I gave him. Thus, “Yes,” 
was all I could manage to croak.
Oh, if only it could have been 
someone else at the door!
For a while now, officials at the 
school have been trying to find a 
replacement for him. Thing is, 
the would-be replacement may 
stay with his current job at Stan­
ford University. I hear that the 
people out there don’t get sick of 
things as easily as we do here, so 
a replacement from California, 
the land of tan bodies, low humid­
ity, and fewer colds, would be nice 
for a change.
And no, the man I hold in con­
tempt doesn’t even almost refer 
to President Cyert.

I am referring to the flu bug.
Within minutes of meeting him, 
I was caught up in a spell of snif­
fling, sneezing, coughing, and 
aching — not to mention a stuffy 
head and fever.
It was horrible. I couldn’t even 
get sympathy from my friends 
because they had all received 
house calls from one of his many 
clones and were just as miserable 
as I was, if not more (and I know 
that some of them really were). 
Thus, I had to suffer by myself.
Could I call Mom at home and 
ask her what to do? Certainly not. 
She would have given me hell if 
she found out that someone (even 
if it wasn’t really a person) had 
taken advantage of me. It was a 
problem I had to handle on my 
own. After all, that’s one thing I 
am supposed to do in college, right?
So, I took a bit of wicked medi­
cine which, to this day, has not 
really helped relieve my agony. 
Little did I know just how wicked 
it was: it did not let me stay awake 
at all. Being in a situation where 
I can’t afford to miss a class, I fell 
asleep in half of them. Those that 
I managed to be partially con-
scious in consisted almost entirely 
of the continuous use of tissues 
until my supply ran out. I would 
have then resorted to using my 
sleeve, but that last sneeze 
cleared me up quite a bit.
I know that sleep is the single 
most important way to take care 
of yourself, but 30 minutes after 
putting my head to the pillow on 
the day I was starting to feel a bit 
better, the fire alarm went off. 
Needless to say, the weatherwas, 
a nasty bit cold, and I stood out­
side shiveringin a mere sweatsuit 
for 15 minutes until I couldn’t 
feel my toes anymore. To quote, 
the philosophy of one of my favor­
ite teachers, “Life’s a bitch.”
So in order to keep yourself 
well, when you see your fellow 
classmates with red noses walk­
ing around saying things like., 
“Ha, wud’s ub wizh yo?” don’t 
stop to answer them or ask what 
happened to their voice.
Run for your life — you never 
know when that little man will 
come and get you.

Of course there are areas where 
there can be a clear-cut harass­
ment policy. Physical attack 
should be prohibited, and one can 
make a good case for not allowing 
people to advocate violence to­
wards other people or groups. But 
that should be the extent of the
policy. No other speech should be 
prohibited. Let existent libel and 
slander laws cover problems aris­
ing between individuals, and let 
the university stand behind free­

If people espouse an opinion

argue against them, prove them
wrong if possible, make them look 
ridiculous if we can; but we have a 
self-same duty not to ask for rules 
that would prohibit them from ex­

It is easy to label someone as ig­

The flag is more 
than just a symbol
zAvrN bnHIAMuW
Let’s talk about symbols. It 
seems that the latter half of the 
1980s were endowed with great 
^ controversy regarding symbols.
' This controversy was sparked by 
the burning of a stolen United 
States flag by a militant commu­
nist group in Texas. This brought 
about a great deal of debate, to 
^ say the least.
Toward the end of 1989, there 
was an emergence of several other 
flag burning incidents and at­
tempted flag burnings, even at 
CMU. But I am not going to 
I discuss whether or not an indi­
vidual has the “right” to bum the 
U.S. flag, which would be a never- 
ending debate. I am going to dis­
cuss WHY someone would want 
to desecrate the flag.
I First of all, is our flag merely a 
symbol? I seriously believe it rep­
resents much, much more. Thou­
sands upon thousands of men and 
women have given their lives for 
the flag. Soldiers, from the War of 
Independence and even more re­
cently, the invasion of Panama, 
have sacrificed their lives so that 
—the flag — representing liberty, 
justice, and democracy — would 
continue to wave. Those individu­
als gave their lives to protect other 
citizens and the liberties that a 
great many of us Americans hold 
so dear. This is much to the dis­
dain of the left-wing in the U.S., 
who strongly believe our flag is 
nothing more than a piece of cloth. 
But this so-called “cloth” repre­
sents a nation which allows them 
to speak and protest as.much as 
they want.
When certain individuals bum 
^ the flag in the name of “art” or 
their so called “right” to do so, 
•" 4hey are not desecrating a mere 
"/flag, but rather, over two hundred 
years worth of hard-earned free-
dom and democracy. A democ­
racy which cost the lives of thou­
sands of people of all races, relig­
ions and creeds.
You would not find a newly- 
arrived immigrant, who has seen 
and experienced oppression and 
tyranny, burning the flag if he or 
she happens to disagree with a 
particular policy or administra­
tion, because his or her animosity 
toward a policy isn’t aimed at a 
flag representing a nation which 
has given them freedom, but 
rather the administration that did 
create that policy. The supposed 
justification for burning the flag 
is that it represents a certain 
group, which it does not.
Newly-arrived people feel deep 
compassion, respect, and love for 
the flag that has allowed them to 
share in the scarce privileges of a 
free and democratic nation. Yet if 
an individual wishes to condemn 
or condone any public official, ad­
ministration, or what-have-you, 
that person is and should be able 
. to express himself. But burning 
the flag is not the answer.
Now, what of thè people who 
oppose the flag burning? As usual, 
people against it are instantly 
subject to condemnation. The sup­
porters of flag burning are quick 
to castigate people opposed to it, 
people who become extremely up­
set and angered by the callow and 
malicious act of burning a flag, 
and thus resort to more cliche 
left-wing name-calling and ex­
pand their pathetic tirade.
I only wish the flag-burners 
would realize that their actions 
are inimical and unfounded, be­
cause every single one of us con­
tributes in many ways to the soci­
ety that makes up the United 
States and is represented by our 
flag: the flag ofthe United States.
So, what is the answer to the 
question as to why certain indi­
viduals bum the flag? Stupidity.

<u The plant trip lets someone have 
dozens of tedious interviews in 
one day in the poorly-lit offices of 
"a'company.
' - The trip provides the one iron-
- ¦dad excuse for missing a class — 
I :si was trying to get a job and this
¦ was the only day they could have 
me.” Unfortunately, this comes 
at the time in our academic ca­
reers where goingto class is about 
as important as your SAT scores. 
f. Senioritis college-style makes the 
high school version look as dull as 
high school itself.
More important than getting 
you out of class, the plant trip 
gets you out of Pittsburgh for free 
for at least one day. FlyingUSAir, 
United, American, and other air­
lines allows you to see all of 
America’s great airports: Pitts­
burgh, Chicago, Dallas, and oth­
ers.
At each airport you’ll find shops 
‘'selling cheap T-shirts with the 
city's name on it so you can bring 
“back souvenirs for all your friends. 
“It seems that some people think 
that an hour layover in an airport 
twenty miles from downtown
1 counts as visiting the city. After 
all, you did get to see it if the 
weather was good and you sat on
the lucky side of the plane while 
landing.
Prices at the airport seem to 
follow the same rules as prices at 
rock concerts, baseball games, and 
New York City. You’ll pay three 
dollars for a hot dog, four dollars 
for nachos or an imported beer. 
The only thing free at an airport 
is the hundreds of copies of USA 
Today which you’ll find at each 
gate.
People still hang out at the air­
ports asking for money. However, 
you won’t find any Hare Krishnas 
anymore. Today’s airport fun­
draisers dress normally, speak 
English, and do not carry tam­
bourines. They will rush towards 
you, as you’re dressed in your 
interview suit, unaware that you, 
the college student, have less 
money than they do.
Compared to the travel, the 
interview itself is often a let­
down. You arrive at the person­
nel office bleary-eyed from the 
night before’s flight or night out, 
guzzle down three cups of coffee, 
and smile weakly as you meet 
your first interviewer. The day 
goes by quickly as you meet per­
son after person whose names you 
can’t remember. Each asks you 
the same questions about Carne­
gie Mellon and tells you the same 
story about how much they enjoy 
working for their company.
Once the day is over, it’s back to 
the airport and the flight which 
will bring you back to Pittsburgh. 
You then get to wait for the check 
to pay for the tickets which put 
you over your credit limit, the 
frequent flier miles which never 
add up to a free trip, and the offer 
which may never come. And of 
course, you do the whole thing all 
over again the following week.

student in GSIA. He is still await­
ing that elusive trip to Cleveland.

Swimmers kick off year with 3 straight wins
SPORTSPEAK
by Josh Ruben
Man turns to 
best friend
; With the football season over 
ind baseball barely a glimmer 
jjion the horizon, we sports- 
type people can only find 
folitude in the annual swimsuit 
SSues. Dealing with this time of 
tear is even harder in Pitts- 
lurgh since we don’t have a 
iasketball team and are still 
lealing with the post-NHL All- 
¡tar Game blues.
What is one to do? The tractor 
mils won’t be in town for a 
while and pro wrestling just is 
lot the same since it went 
prime-time.
In a way, I’m glad we don’t 
;et ESPN here on campus, I’m 
l0t to sure how much Austra- 
ian football and kick-boxing I 
¡ould take.
It’s times like these that a guy 
really lucky to have a friend 
ivith whom he can spend this 
:ompetitive “down-time.” A guy 
s lucky he has a dog.
My dog is probably one of the 
greatest athletes I have ever 
known. He can do it all, even 
)etter than Bo Jackson. His 
name is Frazier. He did not get 
his name from Smokin’ Joe, but 
•ather from a more obscure yet 
:lassier source — Frazier Field 
lere in Oakland. It was and 
¡till is one of the best baseball 
¡fields in the city and is a place 
of great historical significance.
Since he was named after an 
athletic field, he was destined to 
spend most of his life running 
and playing catch. I say “catch” 
rather than “fetch” because any 
dog can watch a stick fly 
through the air and then go and 
“fetch” it once it lands. But, a 
dog that can stand out at 
shortstop or left field and 
‘catch” line drives and fly balls 
is rare.
Frazier is a Chesapeake Bay 
Retriever, an uncommon breed 
aut buy by no means rare. Like 
all retrievers, he loves to swim, 
especially in a river with a good 
current. Unlike any retriever 
I’ve ever seen, he likes to swim 
against the current.
He’s a beast. A big, muscular 
mountain of a dog with a four 
foot tongue and a jaw made of 
cast iron is my dog Frazier.
Grab a hockey stick and stand 
Frazier between a couple of 
trees four feet apart and just try 
'0 shoot some pine cones past 
aim. Mario Lemieux would be 
lucky to score three out of ten 
with Frazier in goal.
In basketball, he can make a 
¡lean steal faster and cleaner 
:han Michael Jordan or Doc 
Rivers.
Of course, Frazier can’t 
Iribble, but it’s great to watch 
aim pick up a regulation sized 
basketball in his mouth.
Just be sure to wipe that ball 
off real good before you try to 
Jlay with it again, otherwise 
you could put a whole new 
meaning into the term “double­
dribble.”
Frazier, however, does have a 
•ough time catching a football, 
he is not a great wide- 
’eceiver. But he would make an 
’Xcellent defensive back. With a 
hree-foot vertical leap, he 
w°uld be good enough to give 
Joe Montana nightmares.
Frazier would be a great for 
sporting goods companies. I 
bonder if Nike is looking for 
pother ad campaign now that 
'his “Bo Knows...” thing is old? 
Nah, Frazier wears Adidas 
anyway.

Bethany fell prey Saturday to 
the Carnegie Mellon swim teams; 
the men won 104-62, and the 
women won 108-66.
The Tartans are on a roll after 
returning from the break with a 
3-0 record, having beaten Wash­
ington and Jefferson, Hiram, and 
Bethany.
The victory Saturday over Be­
thany came on the heels of last 
week’s important double win over 
Hiram, which featured record- 
breakingby several Tartan swim­
mers.
In the Hiram match-up,Coach 
Bruce Brondson was worried that 
the illness that plagued so many 
of his swimmers would affect 
CMU’s performance, as several 
of the swimmers were too ill to 
compete.
But Brondson’s worries were 
soon overcome by relief. Taking 
into account all the “sickies” on 
the teams, he was pleased with 
the outcome of the meet. “They 
did what I wanted them to do,” he 
said.
CMU still had outstanding in­
dividual efforts despite the teams’ 
poor health. On the men’s side, 
freshmen Mike Muller and Todd 
Swanson had their best times ever 
in the 200 backstroke and 50 frees­
tyle, respectively.
Freshman Pete Dautermann 
swam the 200 butterfly for his 
first time and won, while senior 
Pat Hensler and sophomore Norm 
Murray had solid days all around.
The women did their part with 
Grad student Francesca Crannell, 
who had two excellent times in 
the 100 and 200 freestyle. Sopho­
more Debbie Madsen also had an 
exceptional day with good times 
in the 1000 freestyle and the 200 
butterfly.
As for the future of the Tartan 
swimmers, Brondson is a little 
uncertain of what the rest of the 
season may bring. But he is sure 
that much of it depends on how 
the teams “get this [sickness] 
behind us and get on with the rest 
of the year.”
Brondson is reassured by the 
teams’ solid background that they 
have built this far into the sea­
son. Looking beyond the present

The women and men turned in their third victory of the semester as they defeated Bethany Saturday.
sickness, he said the teams are 
“set up to do well” because of the 
hard work they have done so far.
The Tartans have two champi­
onship meets at the end of the 
season—one with the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) and 
the other with the Presidents Ath-
letic Conference (PAC). The com­
petitions are different in their size 
and nature, but Brondson is con­
fident that his teams will do well 
in both. The UAA Championships 
is a larger meet than the PAC, 
with eight teams in the UAA and 
only four in the PAC.
The UAA Championships are 
scheduled for the week of Febru­
ary 14—17 and the PAC Champi­
onships are scheduled for Febru­
ary 22-24.
The Tartans will begin to wind 
down their season today with 
Slippery Rock at 6 pm.
Tartans split competition against Thiel in basketball action
Men can’t pull through in final seconds
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
The closest losses hurt the most, 
when giving what you can is not 
enough.
“When it comes to the clutch 
times, we’re going to have to give 
a little more,” said sophomore 
Robert Sechan.
Carnegie Mellon’s men’s bas­
ketball team had the ball, down 
by two, with 15 seconds remain­
ing against Thiel. The team called 
time out and Coach Larry Ander­
son diagrammed the play — an 
attempt to work the ball inside to 
center Chris Luckett.
The ball never made it into 
Luckett’s hands. The inbound 
pass went to freshman point guard 
Todd Jenkins, but Jenkins was in 
the back court when he caught 
the ball. It was a back court viola­
tion and the ball returned to the 
Tomcats. Carnegie Mellon went 
on to lose 76—70.
“Sometimes you wonder
whether you should call the time 
out or go with the flow,” said Coach 
Anderson. “I should’ve told them, 
‘Make sure you get it in.’ ”
Lapses like that have cost Car­
negie Mellon’s young men’s bas­
ketball team dearly. Losses to 
Thiel and early in the week to 
Washington and Jefferson 
dropped the team’s record to 2-13, 
0-3 in the President’s Athletic 
Conference.
“You can blame inexperience, 
but that gets kind of old,” said 
Luckett.
However, the Tartans are very 
inexperienced. They did receive a 
boost when senior Keith Morgan 
returned to the squad, but suf­
fered another blow when sopho­
more point guard Philip Bronner 
was sidelined with a knee injury. 
Bronner was scheduled to go 
under a magnetic resonance scan 
yesterday and is considered day- 
to-day.
With Bronner out, the team has 
been starting two freshmen, Jen-
&
kins at point guard and Charlie 
Connors at power forward. Addi­
tionally, Anderson has found 
himself tapping the bench ear­
lier, giving Sechan, sophomore 
Jeff Bleacher, and freshman 
Brian Lyscik more minutes.
The team has also pushed the 
ball outside. Carnegie Mellon has 
its smallest front line in years 
and has adjusted with an attack 
that for the first time features the 
three-point shot. Led by Jenkins, 
Sechan, and Chris Dobbs, the 
Tartans attempted 24 long-range 
bombs against W&J. Last season 
they averaged less than nine at­
tempts a game.
“We’ve been experimenting,” 
admitted Anderson.
The experiments seemed to pay 
off early against the Tomcats. The 
Tartans jumped out to an early 
13-6 lead behind the hot shooting 
of Jenkins and Connors. Although 
they could not maintain the seven- 
point lead, they never trailed by 
more than one and led at the half, 
35-33.
However, once again the Tar­
tans came out flat at the start of 
the second half. Thiel’s Jesse Bone 
nailed four three-pointers early 
in the half to help the Tomcats 
build a nine point lead. Carnegie 
Mellon was able to close within 
one with a three-point play by 
Beckham with 3:26 to go, but Thiel 
held on to win, 76-70.

The Tartans took an important 
step toward repeating as Presi­
dents’ Athletic Conference cham­
pions this weekend, beating the 
Thiel Tomcats 55-49. The vic­
tory, which improved the Tartans’ 
conference record to 3—0, gave 
them sole possession of first place 
as th e Tomcats fell from the ranks 
of the unbeaten.
The first half featured a defen­
sive battle, both teams struggling 
on offense. The teams’ offensive 
troubles were highlighted by a 
five minute scoreless stretch and 
a total of 28 turnovers. Poor shoot­
ing was also a key; the Tartans’ 
seven for 23 (.304) shooting be­
came almost respectable when 
compared to Thiel’s pathetic seven 
for 36 (.194) performance.
The only noteworthy perform­
ance was turned in by sophomore 
Amy Buxbaum, who had 12 of her 
17 rebounds before the break. 
When the half finally ended, the 
teams were tied, 18-18.
“We were really sluggish in the 
first half, “ said senior co-captain 
Donna Spicuzza. “We didn’t get to 
run the ball as much as we wanted 
to.”
“We played good defense, but 
we just couldn’t get it together on 
offense,” added sophomore 
Heather O’Donnell.
The second half of the game 
turned out to be much better for 
both teams. Thiel dominated the 
first four minutes with a 10-3 
run, as Thiel senior Julie Sierota 
scored seven of her game-high 23 
points to give the Tomcats a 28-21 
lead. CMU held tough and trailed 
35-30 when senior co-captain Lisa 
Smith and Buxbaum, who had 20 
and 16 points, respectively, led 
the Tartans on a 13—2 run that 
vaulted them back into the lead 
for the first time since the closing 
minutes of the first half.
The Tartans then took control 
of the game, holding Thiel to only 
12 points in the last eight min­
utes while adding to their lead. A 
basket by Buxbaum and a pair of 
free throws by O’Donnell gave
CMU a 55-45 lead with less than 
two minutes to play, allowing 
them to run out the rest of the 
clock for a 55-49 final.
Earlier in the week, the Tar­
tans turned in a much better 
performance as they traveled to 
Washington & Jefferson and de- 
featedthe Presidents, 78—73. Five 
Tartans reached double digits in 
scoring as CMU came from be­
hind for its tenth win of the sea­
son.
The Tartans got out of the gate 
quickly against the Presidents as 
a three-pointer by Smith high­
lighted an 11-4 Tartan run. The 
Presidents proceeded to chip away 
at the Tartan lead until W&J’s 
Marybeth Armstrong tied the 
score at 17 with 12 minutes left in 
the half. The teams traded points 
for the next several minutes, but 
a pair of baskets by Spicuzza al­
lowed CMU to maintain a slim 
31-30 margin with only 3:09 left 
in the half.
The Tartans could not main­
tain their lead as foul trouble

Being aAsEa 81AMutttFood labels can be deceptive, confusing to busy CMU students
Did you know...
•A can of peaches in “light” syrup 
is different from a can in “lite” 
syrup?
•A Prime cut of steak has a sig­
nificantly higher percentage of fat 
than a Select cut?
•About 300 food products don’t 
require an ingredients list?
Reading between the lines is an 
essential component of food shop­
ping, especially for those who need 
to monitor what they eat for one 
reason or another. Because Car­
negie Mellon students rarely find 
the time to cook meals from 
scratch, quick, easy processed 
foods are always a part of campus 
living. Learning to understand 
labels is important.
The most basic part of under­
standing food labels comes in 
knowing the vocabulary. For 
whole cuts of meat and poultry, 
the USDA has established spe­
cific labeling guidelines:
° Lite, Light, Leaner — Signifi­
cantly fewer calories, less fat, and 
at least 25 percent less salt than 
the original product.
•Lean, Low-fat — No more than 
10 percent fat by weight.
•Extra Lean — No more than 5 
percent fat by weight.
•Natural—Minimally processed 
and containing no artificial 
flavors, colors, or preservatives.
•Imitation — Does not contain 
the specific ingredients set forth 
by USDA product standards 
(mandatory label).
Basically, nutrition information 
can be found on about half of all 
packaged foods. When reading 
labels, it is important to keep in 
mind such things as portion size, 
which means one serving as listed, 
not necessarily the entire con­
tainer. Also realize that, when it 
comes to calories, the number
THE STUDENT BODY
by Sheila Skaff
indicated only has to be within 20 
percent of the actual amount, so 
there may be more than antici­
pated. More vocabulary terms: 
•Low Calorie — Must contain no 
more than 40 calories per serv­
ing; foods naturally low in calo­
ries cannot carry this label. 
•Reduced Calorie — Calorie con­
tent must be at least one-third 
lower than that of the food to 
which it is being compared.
•Diet, Dietetic—Must meet same 
requirements as for “low” or “re­
duced” calories, or must be clearly 
described as useful for something 
other than weight reduction. 
•Lite — Must meet the same re­
quirements as for “low” or “re­
duced” calories, and the label must 
carry full nutritional information. 
•Light — This term has yet to be 
defined by the FDA and is used to 
describe everything from taste, 
pale color, and low sodium to 
reduced alcohol or fluffy texture.
When it comes to fats and 
chloresterol, the American Heart 
Association recommends limiting 
fat intake to no more than 30 
percent of daily caloric intake. To 
calculate percentages of fat, take 
the grams of fat indicated and 
multiply by nine, then divide by 
the total number of calories listed 
on the label. Move the decimal 
two places for the answer.
It is also advised, when trying 
to lower fat intake, to stick with
highly polyunsaturated vegetable 
oils such as com, safflower, sun­
flower, sesame, and soybean oil 
or highly monosaturated oils such 
as olive or peanut oil. Try to avoid 
the so-called tropical oils and 
hydrogenated oils.
While reduced sodium refers to 
products which contain at least 
75 percent less sodium than found 
in the original food, foods stated 
to be unsalted, salt-free, or with­
out salt added may still contain 
one of several other sodium com­
pounds.
Ingredients, when listed, are in 
descending order according to 
weight, with no indication of how 
much of any ingredient has been 
used.
Sugar uses several aliases when 
on labels, and therefore can be 
deceptive. It is often called brown 
sugar, corn syrup, honey, dehy­
drated cane juice, glucose, mal­
tose, dextrose, and lactose.
Finally, there are standard-of.' 
identity items to remember about! 
These include margarine, peanut-' 
butter, cheddar cheese, catsup;' 
and mayonaise. Mayonnaise,; for; 
example, must contain vegetable' 
oil, vinegar or lemon juice, 
egg yolk. Any optional ingredi.; 
ents, such as spices, salt, or pre-. 
servatives, must be listed. These; 
foods are made according to reci-! 
pes composed of specific amounts’ 
of various ingredients, and need! 
not list those.
Reading labels gets easier with! 
practice and a little know-how. i

Amidst all the hype that sur­
rounds the conspicuous world of 
varsity sports exists a humbler,
more obscure ----------------------
side of college 
athletics: jun­
ior varsity.
Although the 
reserve teams 
do not receive 
the attention 
that their var­
sity counter­
parts do, they 
are an essential 
element of any 
athletic pro­
gram.
In the case of _______________
Carnegie Mel- ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ 
Ion, the men’s junior varsity team 
serves as a training ground for 
future varsity players, and the 
experience acquired is invaluable 
as upperclassmen leave open 
spaces in the roster.
“Since there will be no seniors, 
the experience will be helpful next 
year,” said freshman Brian Mo­
yer, who sees quite a bit of play­
ing time in varsity games.
Moyer and six other freshman 
and sophomores play on the Tar­
tans’ reserve squad, while at times 
playing at the varsity level. Chris 
Benec is a 6’1” freshman from 
Central Catholic High School in 
Pittsburgh and six-foot freshman 
Matt Onaitis is from Thomas 
Jefferson High School. Other 
freshmen include 6’6” Moyer of
Johnstown, Penn., 6’5” Bryan 
Lyscik, 6’6” Eric Royster of Ran- 
dallstown, Md., and Troy Simms 
is a 5’6” rookie.
Rounding out the squad is 6’4” 
sophomore JefFBleacher. Accord-

Larry Ander­
son, Moyer, 
Lyscik, and 
Bleacher re­
ceive the most

varsity games.
Anderson 
tries to give the 
reserve players 
as many oppor­
tunities as pos­
sible, because, 
“it’s hard to go 
to practice and 
then not get in 
games as freshman.”
The junior varsity players are 
an integral part of the team, said 
Anderson. The entire team con­
sists of 15 players, seven of which 
play for the reserve squad.
Scheduling for junior varsity 
games for the most part includes 
community colleges and junior 
colleges, such as Penn State 
Fayette and Penn State McKeese- 
port.
“This gives them the opportu­
nity to play against some pretty 
decent competition,” said Ander­
son.
Moyer recognizes the value of 
the experience he has gained in 
his first season as a CMU Tartan. 
“It’s a good chance to play to­
gether.”
SRU Invitational readies Indoor Track Tartans
By KELLY STERLING
Tartan Staffwriter
Although competing in a non­
scoring event, the men’s and 
women’s indoor track teams per­
formed very well Friday at the 
Slippery Rock Invitational.
The tournament consisted of 
about 15 teams, including such 
schools as the University of 
Pittsburgh, Robert Morris, 
Geneva, and the host school, 
Slippery Rock. It was a non­
scoring event because each 
team’s individual scores were 
not tabulated. An invitational 
mainly highlights individual 
events.
Some highlights for the Tar­
tans were in the mile, half-mile, 
and 200 meter events. Glen 
O’Neill took second in the mile 
with a time of 27.3. Brad 
Shapiro also took second in the
-V
....
half-mile with 2.04. Jeff Dilian 
won the 200 meter event with a 
time of 24.1. Head Coach Gary 
Meckley felt that Jason Lange 
and Frank Desiderio also did well.
“We did very well,” said Meck­
ley. “I feel we were probably one 
of the top two or three teams
- X S~\î
there.”
The women did almost as well 
against the tough competition, 
although they were a bit over­
whelmed by it. Head Coach Dario 
Donatelli said that “there were a 
lot more schools than we (the 
team) expected.”
Highlights for the Lady Tar­
tans included performances in 
the quarter-mile, 200 meter, 
and the mile. Junior Lisa 
Schmidt took second in the 
quarter-mile and the 200 meter 
with times of 65:0 and 28:5, 
respectively. Carolyn Lowe took 
third in the mile with a time of 
5:39. Teammate Kristin Bur- 
gard took fifth in the same 
event, with a time of 5:43.
Looking toward the season? 
Donatelli feels that, in the UAA^1 
“individuals will do well ancT 
score a lot of points.” Howeverj 
he also said that the limited 
number of players (12) would

The CMUhockey team suffered 
its second straight home defeat, 
losing Sunday to West Virginia, 
5-3. The key to the Tartans’ loss, 
which evened their record at 3-3, 
was inefficient penalty-killing 
that allowed three Mountaineer 
goals.
“We took a lot of bad penalties, 
and it really cost us,”said Dave 
Collins. “We played a good game, 
but we just didn’t put the puck in 
the net enough.”
The Mountaineers, fresh off of 
an upset of top-ranked Pitt, en­
tered the game in second place in 
the West Penn College Hockey 
Association. The Tartans, on the 
other hand, came into the game 
looking to break a three-way tie 
with IUP and Slippery Rock.
The Tartans fell behind early, 
but knotted the game a few min­
utes later on a goal by grad stu­
dent Ed Pike. Pike, playing de­
fense for the Tartans, blasted a 
slapshot by the Mountaineer 
goalie to tie the game, 1-1.
Then, the Tartans’ luck turned

sour. An even strength goal was 
followed quickly by the first West 
Virginia power play goal, and the 
first period ended with the Tar­
tans trailing 3-1.
The Mountaineers proceeded to 
break the game open in the sec­
ond period. A lone Tartan goal by 
Collins was offset by a pair of
West Virginia power play goals.
“Two of their goals came in fivei 
on three situations,” explained- 
Collins.

make the score closer, but thea 
Tartans went quietly in the third 
period to seal the 5-3 loss.

continued from page 13
breed head coach Gerri Seidl to 
bench Buxbaum and senior 
IVicia Chorgo. The resulting 
joss of rebounding advantage 
proved costly as the Presidents 
went on a 9-2 run and took a 
89-33 lead to halftime.
! At half time, Seidl switched to 
the four-guard offense that had 
¡rorked against the University 
of Chicago, and the effects were 
immediately noticeable. After 
an opening basket by W&J, the 
Tartans went on a 10-point run 
that gave them a 43-42 lead.
The Presidents briefly recap­
tured the lead only to watch 
CMU score seven more unan­
swered points to take a 50-46 
lead with 13:16 left.
“The four-guard offense al- 
ows us to run more and get 
more layups off of the break,’ 
explained Spicuzza.
Less than a minute later, the 
Presidents had evened the game 
at 50, but CMU now had momen­
tum on their side. The Tartans 
once again took the lead, but suf­
fered a seemingly crucial loss 
when Buxbaum, who led CMU 
with 10 rebounds, fouled out with 
8:17 left. However, the Tartans 
didn’t have to worry too much, as 
Chorgo, replacing Buxbaum as 
the lone forward, played solid 
defense down the stretch.
“If they hadn’t played as well as 
they did, we would have been in 
trouble,” said Seidl.
The next six minutes passed 
with W&J threatening numerous
times, but never evening the 
score as the Tartans’ 65 percent 
second-half shooting made the 
difference. CMU broke away 
down the stretch when the 
Presidents were forced to foul, 
but an Armstrongthree-pointer 
made the score look closer as 
the Tartans iced the 78-73 win.
With the victories, the Tar­
tans move to an 11—6 overall 
record as they travel to Bethany 
today. After playing the Bisons, 
the team takes a week off in 
preparation for a crucial road 
trip against Chicago and Wash­
ington University, the current 
UAA leaders.

vhere it was bombed by the 
'residents, 91-72. The game 
ollowed a familiar script; the 
’artans hung tough in the early 
roing, trailing by five at 
ime.
The start of the second half 
as a replay of the games 
¡ainst Thiel and Washington 
7. W&J outscored Carnegie 
ellon 17—4 over the first five
minutes to build an 18-point lead 
which wouldneverbe threatened. 
The Presidents coasted to an easy 
91-72 win.
This Week: Tomorrow night 
the team travels to Bethany to 
take on the Bisons (5-11, 0-2). 
Bethany is led by Chris 
Geruschat, averagingl2.2 points 
per game, and Don McFarland, 
averaging 4.6 assists per game. 
Last season the two teams split 
their games, CMU winning at
home, 92-77, and Bethany 
winning on its home court, 
84-79.
Saturday, the Tartans res­
ume UAA play and get their 
second chance against NYU 
(11—6, 3-5). Earlier in the sea­
son, the Violets, led by Eric 
Hutcherson’s 15 points, 
pounded CMU in New York, 
100-78. The game begins at 2 
pm in the SMbo Gymnasium

Trades and All-Star game 
are hot topics in hockey
By MICHAEL D. C. DROUT
Tartan Staffwriter
The big story in the NHL last 
week was the Bernie Nicholls 
trade. Nicholls, the league’s fourth 
leading scorer overall last year 
and consistently in the top five 
this year, was traded to the New 
York Rangers for Tomas Sand- 
strom and Tony Granato.
Dumping a high-scoring player 
into the midst of the excruciat­
ingly tight Patrick Division race, 
the trade has provoked both con­
troversy and speculation. If 
Nicholls can continue to score at 
the same rate, he may be able to 
pull the Rangers out of the Pat­
rick cellar.
There are many, however, who 
feel that Bruce McNall and the 
LA Kings got the better of the 
deal. Despite his 150-plus point 
season last year, Nicholls has 
never gotten much respect around 
the league. He has a reputation of 
hanging on the blue line, not 
dropping back on defense, and 
picking up a lot of cheap goals.
Also, with Gretzky on the first 
line pickingupthetop checkers of 
each team, Nicholls has not had 
to go up against the best defen­
sive forwards in the game. Many 
feel that Nicholls will not con­
tinue his scoring in the tougher 
checking Patrick Division.
Sandstrom, on the other hand, 
could blossom into his full poten­
tial with the Kings. With the more 
wide-open, high scoring game 
played in the Smythe division, 
Sandstrom’s weak physical game 
will not be as noticeable and his 
excellent puck handling and skat­
ing skills should come into their 
own. Sandstrom has the capabil­
ity to become another Esa

HAvE IAguENt
Tikkanen, and probably will be a 
winger for Gretzky in the next 
year or two.
Granato is more questionable. 
Following a great start, Granato 
stopped scoring goals after being 
knocked unconscious in a game 
against Toronto last year. It will 
be interesting to see if he will pick 
up his game now that he has been 
traded. There is speculation that 
Granato, famed in his rookie year 
for his diving and poor checking, 
will improve his work ethic and 
his physical play in the presence 
of the Great One.
All Star Game. The forty-first 
All Star Game, played in Pitts­
burgh last Saturday, was every­
thing John Ziegler andNBC could 
have wanted. Though the score 
was ridiculously high, there was 
a nice exhibition of skills. Even 
more impressive than MVP Mario 
Lemieux’s four goals was the per­
formance by Buffalo Sabres goalie 
Darren Puppa.
The game would have been 
12—12 or worse if he had not come 
up with some superlative saves in 
the third period, including three 
point-blank shots by Jari Kurri. 
Kirk Muller of the Devils, Luc 
Robitaille of the Kings, and Pi­
erre Turgeon of the Sabres all had 
excellent games.
At the skills competition on the 
day before the All-Star game, A1
Iafrate of the Maple Leafs sur­
prised everyone by defeating 
Calgary’s Al Maclnnis in the slap­
shot competition, 96 to 92 mph. 
Mike Gartner of Minnesota won a 
speed skating race marred by the 
absence of Pittsburgh’s Paul Cof­
fey, and goalie Kirk MacLean of 
the Vancouver Canucks won 
honors as top goaltender in the 
breakaway competition.
Around the NHL. Maple 
Leafs coach Doug Carpenter had 
a sweet homecoming when the 
Leafs defeated the New Jersey 
Devils on the two year anniver­
sary of Carpenter’s firing. De- 
fenseman Alexi Kasatonov 
scored his first NHL for the 
Devil’s only goal of the evening. 
The Devils will be missing Left 
Wing Brendan Shannahan for 
five games as he serves a sus­
pension for cutting Quebec’s 
Michel Petit with his stick.
More talk from the owners 
about instituting an instant 
replay for goal / no-goal deci­
sions: new word is that the re­
play will be tested during the 
final two rounds of the playoffs, 
when an incorrect decision could 
theoretically cost a franchise 
millions of dollars. Only the 
referee will be able to call for a 
replay, and the NHL plans to 
use Sportschannel’s cameras if 
needed.

Russia!
Eight CMU professors visit the Soviet Union
By ERIC J. MCANALLEN
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
“In some sense, the exhibit and 
I our presentations were telling the 
¡ Soviets what our design was like 
land what the life of [an Ameri- 
I can] designer was like.... We spent 
I the time out of the exhibit trying 
I to find out what it was like to be a 
I designer in the Soviet Union,” said 
(Assistant Professor of Graphic 
I Design Roy McKelvey about his 
I recent trip to the USSR.
; McKelvey spent six weeks in 
I Leningrad as a resident special- 
11st in graphic design for “Design 
tJSA.” The program is touring the 
pountry with the purpose of intro­
ducing American products and 
design concepts to over two mil­
lion Soviet citizens.
As the resident specialist, 
McKelvey was expected to be at 
the exhibit day in and day out. 
The exhibits, manned by three 
other resident specialists and 
Russian-English speaking inter­
preters, consisted of multi-media 
displays of U.S. housing furni­
ture, toys, publications, and sports 
and electronic equipment.
“There was an exhibit of Ameri­
can kitchen design,” related 
McKelvey. “ The Soviets loved it.”
The program, which is spon­
sored by the U.S. Information 
Agency, features a welcome from 
President Bush, a look at Thomas 
Jefferson as the first American 
designer, and a 1989 Chevrolet 
Corvette.
Along with McKelvey, four other 
CMU faculty members travelled 
to Leningrad for a week-long semi­
nar entitled “Directions in De­
sign and Innovation.” They were 
Todd Cavalier, assistant profes­
sor of design; Paul Rosenblatt, 
assistant professor of architec­
ture; Richard Cleary, associate 
professor of architecture; and 
Stephen Stadelmeier, associate 
professor of industrial design. 
Arnold Wasserman of the 
UNISYS corporation, co-sponsor 
of the Leningrad trip, moderated 
the seminar.
McKelvey explained that design 
in the Soviet Union is different 
because of economic and political 
pressures. There is little competi­
tion because everything is run by 
the state.
“The idea of entrepreneurial 
product development is counter 
to their system. Everything is 
planned and decided by a com-
Carnegie Mellon Professor Paul Rosenblatt speaks about “Directions in Design Innovations” to Soviet designers at a seminar in Leningrad.
mittee,” said McKelvey. “What 
you see is all kinds of design being 
done for no purpose.”
Because there is very little ac­
cess to printers, most designers 
use painting or photography to 
produce their works, creating a 
different type of design based less 
on sophisticated technology and 
more on manual skills. “They have 
a level of skill in drawing which 
has been lost in this country. They 
are extremely capable craftsmen,” 
said Cavalier.
Rosenblatt, who lectured the 
Soviets on the use of computers in 
design, said, “When I planned this, 
I had an image in my mind of the 
Soviet Union which was very 
depressed, but it was worse than

AgN IE 1Eu I4gNEM,oa CE4CaE3 AgN 
1ANE UMEAu ,MrEgN8t yT4NN JAvAarEM
any expectations I had.”
The design and architectural 
institutions of the Soviet Union 
do not have the resources for tools 
found in the United States. Pen­
cils, paper, and knives are scarce, 
and a computer, which may cost a 
studentninehundreddollars here 
in the United States, is out of the 
reach of the Soviet students and 
schools alike.
“There were significant prob­
lems in talking about what we 
were doing,” said Rosenblatt. 
“Problems not in the sense that 
they couldn’t understand what 
we were talking about, but prob­
lems of frustration on their part, 
because they are far away from 
being able to have the resources 
we have.”
However, the trip was not all 
work. The members of the team 
got a chance to experience first­
hand the attitudes and lives of 
the people in the Soviet Union. “It 
was a very amazing experience, 
and we met wonderful people, and 
made great friends,” said Cava­
lier.
According to McKelvey, when 
talkingto the Soviet citizens about 
perestroika and Soviet Premier
Gorbechev, “They were very cyni­
cal. They didn’t seem to have any 
faith at all that their lives were 
going to getbetter. The only bene­
fit I think they saw in glasnost 
was that they could bitch openly.” 
While speaking about the trip, 
Cavalier enthusiastically told the 
story of their train ride from 
Moscow to Leningrad. “Going 
across this frozen expanse in the 
middle of the night and waking 
up because the train had stopped 
by this frozen lake was like some­
thing out of Doctor Zhivago. And 
we were being taken care of by 
this old Russian woman who was 
serving us tea out of this old 
samovar. It was really quite an 
experience, really exciting.” 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mel­
lon were represented at the kick- 
off seminar in Moscow last Sep­
tember by faculty members Dan 
Droz and Joseph Balay, Georgette 
Demes of the University’s Engi­
neering Design Research Center, 
and Pittsburgh designer Gerald 
Proctor.
Tim Cunningham will be par­
ticipating in the upcoming Don­
etsk leg of the tour, entitled 
“Design in a Mid-sized American 
City.” “Our seminar is going to 
deal with how design has changed 
in Pittsburgh. We are working 
real hard to present an accurate 
picture of our design.... Itis going 
to be interesting to compare the 
operations of the [Soviet] design­
ers to our own,” related Cunning­
ham.
JoiningCunningham on the trip 
to Donetsk (which is said to be the 
Soviet counterpart to Pittsburgh) 
will be: Rick Landesberg, Dan 
Boyarski, and John Martin.
Cavalier will be returning to 
the USSR for six weeks next 
February to serve as a resident 
graphic design specialist. Also, 
Carroll Gantz, the head of Carne­
gie Mellon’s design department, 
will be making a trip in 1991 to 
. serve as the specialist in indus­
trial design.
Paul Rosenblatt and Richard 
Cleary will give a lecture on their 
visit to the Soviet Union next 
Tuesday at 7:30 pm in Wean Hall 
7500.
One of the many 
exhibits of 
American design 
that Soviet 
citizens saw 
during “Design

visit to Leningrad.

good dancing, and good fun.
Sponsored by the Society of Women Engineers, the 
Ball was held last Saturday night at the Saint Nicholas 
Greek Orthodox Church on Forbes. Dinner, consisting of 
chicken, ham, beef, and pasta shells, was followed by 
dancing and a open bar.
The music was standard dance music provided by a DJ, 
and the dance floor was enlivened by colored, flashing 
lights and a fog machine.

Last Thursday, there was an 
art exhibition in Doherty Hall. 
Some members of the campus 
community thought that the 
exhibition was in some ways 
pornographic.
This past summer, Robert 
Mapplethorpe, a photographer 
was not allowed to show his 
work in a gallery because cer­
tain people thought his work 
was offensive.
The National Endowment of 
the Arts stated that if the gallery 
showed Mapplethorpe’s pic­
tures, that gallery would lose 
some federal funding.
His work was eventually 
shown at another gallery in 
Washington.
U.S. Senator Jesse Helms was 
behind the movement to remove 
federal funding for art that is 
deemed “obscene or indecent 
art.”
So, we went out and asked the 
campus community; is there a 
distinction between artandpor- 
nography?
Jonathan Barnes 
Senior, H&SS
“Art I think is something that 
stimulates the cerebral and has 
overall positive qualities. Pornog­
raphy debases the human being 
to a certain extent. Art can be 
somewhat pornographic but I 
don’t think pornography is art. 
Whereas I don’t think Henry 
Miller is pornography but I think 
Hustler is, whereas some of the 
people might say Henry Miller 
is.”
Jim Campo 
Freshman, H&SS
“I guess there is a distinction 
between art and pornography. 
You can have tasteful art but I 
guess if it’s vulgar, sick or degrad­
ing it’s pornography.”
Kiran Rao 
Sophomore, CIT
“It all depends on the person’s 
opinion of what he feels is offen­
sive and whathefeels art is. There 
is a line between art and pornog­
raphy. Art is something that 
arouses whatever curious emo­
tions or whatever good emotions 
but pornography is something 
that is just disgusting.”
Julie Winieski 
Freshman, CFA
“There is a definite, definite dis­
tinction between pornography 
and art. It’s the difference be­
tween being nude and being naked 
and there are many people who 
don’t understand that. But I would 
say there is a definite difference 
between art and pornography.”
Jonathan Elderfleld/Tartan photographer
Bob Saulnier 
Senior, CIT
“It depends on the person who 
is viewing it. If that person is 
looking at it for art purposes 
and is finding some aesthetic 
meaning behind it then it’s art, 
otherwise it’s pornography.”
Zelda’s special shrimp, chicken, 
broccoli and basil pizza is unique
By JON SLENK, BARRY

Tartan Staffwriters
During the course of this school 
year, we have sampled several 
different companies’ pizzas. Most 
of them were, if not wonderful, at 
least somewhat desirable. None 
of the pizzas were really terrible. 
None, that is, until Zelda’s pep­
peroni came along.
Giving a company a bad review 
could make one feel guilty, were it 
; notforthefactthatthepurposeof 
a review is to save the consuming 
: public from wasting their time 
and money on something they 
would really rather have not 
experienced. Thus, in our review 
we will be perhaps painfully 
honest: Zelda’s pepperoni pizza is 
bad.
The box opened to reveal a pizza 
only slightly covered with pep­
peroni, with crust which, if forced 
to describe, could only be described 
as boring, only while noting that 
this is indeed overstating the case. 
The cheese was, in fact, level with 
the crust. Which is not to say that 
there was a great deal of cheese, 
but rather that there was not 
much crust! In addition, on most 
pizzas you can see sauce here and 
there, especially around the crust. 
Could we expect this from Zeldas? 
Noooooo! To be fair, there were 
spices scattered about the edges, 
but usually, they are found in a 
tomato medium.
We sat down with less than 
enthusiasm, and didn’t even 
finish the pizza. It was a bit cool. 
The lack of flavor was appalling! 
The cheese was, by far, the least 
flavorful of that which we have 
sampled. Admittedly, there was 
an acceptable quantity, but who 
wants an acceptable quantity of 
rubber? As far as the pepperoni is 
concerned, it was satisfactory, but 
there wasn’t enough of it! The 
sauce? What sauce? We could not 
taste tomatoes at all! Further­
more, the dough was virtually 
white once the cheese was re­
moved. We agreed that more 
sauce, nay, any noticeable sauce 
would be preferable. It came with 
two cokes (they were good!), which 
is their standard procedure. To 
sum up: don’t order a pepperoni 
pizza from Zelda’s. The only thing 
worse we’ve ever had comes fro­
zen.
“Oh my God! It has fish!”
Laughter erupted across the 
room. This was the first pizza to
have any form of seafood on it. 
The manager’s choice was a 
shrimp-chicken- broccoli-basil 
special. No sauce. No, really! It 
was a true sauceless pizza. After 
we quieted down, we discussed 
the situation, and realized that 
Zelda’s was the first to try a truly 
different and unique pizza. It was 
good! If you want to try some­
thing different and tasty, this is 
worth it. The flavors go together 
well, and the shrimp were large 
and cooked nicely. The chicken 
was tender and appetizing. The 
basil scattered liberally across the 
cheese was a perfect addition. One 
improvement would have been 
less stalk, and more flower on the 
broccoli. Although this is some­
thing we would never have 
thought to order, it was light, 
pleasant, and satisfying.
Zelda’s pepperoni costs $7.25, 
including two cokes. Their phone 
number (should you find reason 
to use it) is 681-3971.

Pennsylvania Bill finds Dos Equis to his taste
editor’s Note: Pennsylvania Bill 
¡¡¡¡fictional beer connoisseur trav­
elling around the world review­
ing beers from various countries.
I entered the dust-covered bar 
and sat down on the stool furthest 
from the door, still trying to avoid 
jfjm. I asked the bartender for a 
cold brew. He gave me a Dos 
Equis and he asked me where I 
was fr°m- “Where you from?”
So I told him my story. I started 
at the beginning. I was eight and 
my grandfathertookme aside and 
told me the legend of the White 
Burger.
“Grandson,” he said, “at the Last 
Supper, they had hamburgers. 
One of the burgers was not eaten. 
This burger is now known as the 
White Burger. Go out and find it, 
my son.”
I tried to correct him, because I 
was not his son, but he kicked the 
bucket before I could.
The bucket landed on my aq­
uarium, killing my pet hermit 
crab, Pennsylvania. I took his 
name — the crab, not my grand­
father — and that is how my ad­
venture started. Pennsylvania 
Bill, in search of the infamous 
White Burger.
AROUND THE WORLD 
IN EIGHTY BEERS
by William Burky
My quest brought me to this 
desolate bar, located on the 
Yucatan Peninsula. Back in my 
hometown of Pittsburgh, I read 
in a newspaper that an old pickle 
had been found in the Aztec ruins 
down here. According to the pa­
per, the old pickle was an ancient 
religious relic that Cortez had 
brought over from Spain.
My first thought was that the 
pickle was somehow related to 
the White Burger.
I came down here and dug and 
archaeolized until my hands were 
bloody (forgot my shovel) and what 
did I find? Nothing, absolutely 
nothing. Then Miguel Hernadez, 
the man who found the old pickle, 
came to me and asked me what I 
was doing in the dirt. I told him.
“I’m looking for the old pickle 
that was found here.”
He replied, “I found the pickle, 
but I didn’t put it back into the 
dirt. It’s at my house, would you 
like to see it?”
‘Yes.” We went to his house and 
looked at the pickle. It was old, 
very old. My God, it was old.
“Do you know what this pickle 
could mean to the world?” I asked. 
He looked at me strangely.
“No, I don’t,” he said.
Damn, neither did I.
“Could I talk to you outside?” 
We went outside and he told me 
about finding the old pickle. Half­
way through his story, his kid 
came out of the house, eating.
“Hi, Dad. Thiscucumbertastes 
funny.”
My gut committed hara-kiri. It 
was true; the kid had eaten the 
pickle and I was back at square 
one.
At least I have a cool name.
The bartenderhadlookedatme 
throughout my story.
“Bummer of a story,” he said 
when I finished. “I love hermit 
crabs, have two of them back 
home.”
I finished off the beer and asked 
for another. “What kind of beer is 
this?”
“Dos Equis. Brewed right here 
in Montezuma. Not a bad beer.”
William Burky is a junior computer engineering major who travels the 
world in search of the perfect beer.
“No, actually it’s pretty good. 
There is a slight aftertaste to it. 
Sort of an applely-type of after­
taste.”
He replied, “That’s only when 
it’s cold. Once this beer hits room 
temperature, it starts to get 
nasty.”
“It’s a dark beer, but it doesn’t 
taste like one.”
“Yeah, it’s not very bitter for a 
dark beer. Here, look at the color
of it.” He pulled out a mug and 
poured some of the beer into the 
mug. “See, it looks like watered- 
down Coke or iced tea. Doesn’t 
look like your typical beer.”
He was right. Even the foam 
was darker than a normal beer. 
The foam was actually brown.
That’s , when the door swung 
open to the bar. It was Him. He 
had found me, again.
“Is there a back way out of
here?” I asked the bartender. He 
pointed me in the direction and I 
started to run for it. He saw me ; 
and started to run after me.
I bolted down to the docks, 
knocking over a vegetable stand ;
and three old ladies. There was i__
steamer preparing to depart. 
pushed myself harder and jumped;™* 
at the last second. I landed on th3»S 
deck shortly before the crev 
boarded. He was left behind; the 
three old ladies were beating him • 
with asparagus.
The boat left the dock and I 
settled into my cabin to finish 
writing. I guess I should explain;-^ 
who He is. He is Johann River-it 
dam, a complete jerk, who followSta 
me around lecturing me about Si 
the evils of drinking. I don’t like -.» 
him; I like drinking. But he in-jji

Carnegie Mellon’s leaders come together to learn
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Features Asst. Editor
Nearly 80 of Carnegie Mellon’s 
student leaders came together 
Saturday for an intensive all day 
conference dedicated to develop­
ing their leadership skills. The 
seminar was sponsered by the 
Student Activities Board and gave 
the student leaders a chance to 
learn from the experiences of the 
people in Carnegie Mellon’s 
administration.

Among the members of CMU’s Student Affairs, Anne 
administration present were Witchner,Director of Student 
Michael Murphy, acting Dean of Activities, and Lois Cox, Associ­
ate Dean of Student Affairs.
Roy Fox, a local radio personal­
ity, was the keynote luncheon 
speaker. In his speech, he stressed 
the value of thinking about what 
is important instead of worrying 
about pointless details. He said 
that we too often fill the void in 
our minds with loud music and 
pointless political issues instead 
of substantial thought.
The all day seminar was split 
up into four sessions starting at 
9:00 am and ending at 4:00 pm.
There was an hour and a half 
break for lunch in the Faculty 
Dining Room.
During each session partici­
pants were given the choice of 
four or five topics. Topics covered 
included: membership motiva­
tion, communication goal setting 
and goal getting, and student or­
ganization budgets.
Fox asked the audience how 
many of them would be able to 
answer the question, “What do 
you think?” He was addressing
the leaders of this community, ; • 
but the question applies to every- 
one.
What do you think about life? 3 
about death? about the future?
As a leader, do you have a spe- 
cific plan or goal for your group to ;1; 
work together to achieve?
As a person, do you have a spe-/ ; 
cific, worthwhile goal to strive ‘ 
for?
Leadership is not important so ! 
much for its own sake, but for the" j 
goal that it hopes to achieve. ; ¦=;
‘There really is no reason 
why I am a vegetarian’
The state of humanity has al­
ways been one of incessant ques­
tioning. Mostly, our questions 
are greeted with even more ques­
tions.
This state of affairs has led 
many inquisitive, with-it sort of
• individuals to forget all about the 
demons which populate their 
psyche and pay five dollars to go 
see Tango & Cash.
Although the current wisdom 
tells us that there really is no 
truth, no past, no present, no 
reality and no way to tell why it is 
that a movie like Tango & Cash 
can actually go on to make fifty 
million dollars at the box office, I 
happen to think that concrete 
answers do exist, but only to the 
most basic of questions.
Unfortunately, the most basic 
questions are seldom the ones we 
really want answered anyway. 
Anybody who has ever asked for 
the price of a piece of Bazooka 
bubble gum only to be confronted 
with the glaring non-sequitur 
“The three- or the two-cent kind?” 
probably knows what I am talk­
ing about.
The big kahuna as far as prime­
val riddles go has got to be that 
time worn chestnut “Why?” 
Personally, I think that “Why” is 
overrated.
Perhaps I have gotten to that 
point where I am more aware of 
being asked “Why” than of asking 
the question “Why.”
Consider this; recently I became 
a vegetarian. As my friends found 
out about this the inevitable fol­
lowed, “Why?”
The truth is, there really is no 
reason why I am a vegetarian, at 
least I have been unable thus far 
to find a coherent reason for this 
sudden onslaught of vegetarian­
ism.
I certainly am not self-right- 
eous enough to believe that world­
wide slaughterhouse activity will 
come to a standstill if I stop eat­
ing meat.
I have no religious reason for 
which to become a vegetarian; I 
even like the taste of red meat,
CO0 ?n?E

SOME LIKE IT JAVIby Javier Grillo-Marxuach
and there certainly is no higher, 
predetermining force manipulat­
ing me toward a life of greenery.
At least I would like to think 
that if there is some extraterres­
trial force manipulating me, that 
it would choose something a little 
bit more significant to do with me 
than eternally barring me from 
the meat counter at the Big Bird 
(the Giant Eagle, to some).
Besides, the thought that the 
most significant task that a 
higher, extraterrestrial intelli­
gence can compel me to perform is 
to eat a lot of garbanzo beans is 
one I find patently depressing.
If there is one question I would 
like answered it would have to be, 
“Why does there have to be a rea­
son for everything?”
If there is one foible I would 
like to eradicate in society, next to 
violent crime, bureaucracy, nepo­
tism, governmental corruption, 
misogyny, the deficit, prejudice, 
the misuse of nuclear technology, 
the destruction of the environ­
ment, people not wanting to 
understand each other and Tango 
& Cash, it would have to be hy­
peranalysis.
Somehow, somewhere, we seem 
to be losing touch with the idea 
that you can kill an experience by 
looking too close at it. Any one of 
my fellow near-sighted people will 
know exactly what I am talking 
about.
To be perfectly honest, after 
fifteen years in an educational 
system which places absolute 
importance upon understanding 
the reason why (well, unless you 
count those patches of our educa­
tional system where being able to 
read the word “Why” is an accom­
plishment), I must say that I no
longer really feel the desire to 
understand the “Why” behind 
anything.
If it is so important to under­
stand why, why is it that the end 
product of all understanding is 
that there really is nothing to 
understand, and most impor­
tantly, why couldn’t they have 
told us this in the first place?
Personally, I think I would have 
probably grown up much more 
well adjusted, contented and 
happy if that kindly, slightly 
tubby woman who ran my first 
grade homeroom had ambled into 
the classroom one morning and, 
in that adorable, high pitched 
squeal which had a comforting 
timbre similar to that of the acci­
dental meeting of a French horn 
and a fusion reactor in a Robo- 
Coupe food processor made it quite 
clear that:
“Kiddies,there really is nothing 
to know. Your life is a meaning­
less, random metabolic process 
impressed upon an otherwise 
eternal state of nothingness, and 
the sooner you are all dead you 
will come to embrace the truth 
that is your own insignificance.
“You will never understand the 
reason for anything, and for all of 
the inquiries which you will make 
into anything you will find that 
your own stone-headed inability 
to accept the simple fact that the 
relationship between event and 
causality is not necessarily clear 
cut and not necessarily a rela­
tionship at all, will doom you into 
an eternal paralysis from which 
you will never emerge.
“Your life will therefore be 
fraught with anxiety and contra­
diction which you will never be 
truly able to bring into a coherent 
light and Sylvester Stallone will 
always make lots of money. Nap 
time!”

gent extraterestrials from Mars to

ing and vegetarianism.

Cats are fine creatures, even if they don’t taste good broiled

Funded by the Activities Fee
in these games, Christians were 
thrown to Lions. During the in­
termissions, house-cats would 
feed on a few, fairly religious 
townfolks.
During the Middle Ages, the vi­
cious warrior cats of the Romans 
were used in monasteries to guard 
valuable manuscripts and reli­
gious artifacts, and gained high 
regard in religious circles. In fact, 
during the time of Pope Pious III, 
the act of grabbing a cat by its tail 
and spinning it around above your 
head (a common activity, prac­
ticed widely by the serfs), was 
punishable by excommunication.
This edict was later rescinded 
when the papacy was moved to 
France. In the age of Enlighten­
ment, cats, who by this time had 
progressed into their current 
docile form, were widely used by 
the scientific community. Indeed, 
Sir Isaac Newton conducted many 
experiments on the thermody­
namic properties of cats (see In 
ConflagribusFelis, “On theFlam- 
mability of Cats,” pub. Crock &
Sham 1984).
Of course, one should never 
forget the important role cats 
played in the world of art. It is a 
well documented fact that cats 
have possessed the soul of some of 
the world’s most talented artists. 
Cezanne was possessed by the 
spirit of a large tabby, while 
Toulouse Lautrec’s personality, 
for a time, was taken over en­
tirely by a Persian cat named 
Mittens. Van Gough was pos­
sessed not only by a Siamese cat, 
but by a pit-bull, as well. Hence, 
his violent mood swings, in which 
he would frequently chase him­
self around the house and yard, 
eventually cornering himself in a 
tree.
Although, in recent years, the 
incidences of cat-possession have 
significantly dropped, it is not 
unheard of for an art student to 
suddenly find his or her conscious­
ness taken over by a feline spirit. 
Research into this is being con­
ducted, and the results will be 
published here if they’re not too
silly.
The modem cat has a number 
of remarkable characteristics, not 
the least of which is its intelli­
gence. With patience, using the 
same techniques which are used 
to train dogs, a cat can train its 
owner to perform any number of 
clever tricks, from getting out of a 
comfortable chair to feed it, to 
letting it into the house in the 
middle of the night, merely by 
howling outside the front door for
ten or twenty minutes.
The diet of the cat is remarka­
bly varied. In the wild, it exists on 
nothing but birds, rodents, and 
whatever it can forage from gar­
bage cans. When housebroken, 
though, it will consent to eat such 
diverse items as lobster, salmon, 
steak, patee, tuna, and, occasion­
ally, cat food. (Cats, on the whole, 
are reluctant to eat this last item, 
and will, more often than not, 
have to be coaxed into eating it.
The author recommends putting 
it on a decorative piece of china 
and feeding it to the feline with a 
spoon, or fork.)
In conclusion, if you own a cat 
you should be certain to care for it 
properly. Many vets recommend 
special foods and vitamin injec- 
tions to prolong the life of your 
feline.
Freeze-dryingis another highly 
regarded method of improving 
longevity. In studies done by 
people at universities, cats which 
are freeze-dried have been shown 
to last ten to twenty times longer 
than those which haven’t been.
If, however, you are the kind of 
owner who likes to skimp on your 
pet’s welfare, at least take him for 
regular visits to the vet’s. Moat 
authorities feel that once every 
six months is sufficient; after your 
pet has died, once every year; af­
ter your vet has died, every two 
years.

Did you know that before you 
die, you will spend seven years in 
the bathroom? Three years sit­
ting in meetings? Two years play­
ing phone tag? One year search­
ing through the piles of garbage 
sitting on your desk and six 
months waiting for the light to 
turn from red to green?
Fortino, president of Fortino & 
Associates, and Lynn Cassella, 
public relations director of Fortino 
;& Associates, co-wrote a book 
entitled Time Flies When You’re 
Not Having Fun that deals with 
statistics of this type.
Now, Fortino & Associates is
looking for students to fill several 
internship positions. The good 
news is that the positions will be 
filled by Carnegie Mellon students 
exclusively. The exact number of 
positions available is not known, 
but Cassella says, “We are look­
ing for about 15 students. A 
maximum of 20.”
Last Friday, a meeting was held 
for interested applicants and
appproxiamately ten students 
showed up. However, Cassella 
stated that positions are still 
available.
Cassella is anxious to work with 
the students. “I’m hoping [the 
internship] will be very positive 
and we will be able to work our 
schedule around [the students] to 
have the most possible students 
involved.”
Fortino & Associates, a local 
company, is a consulting firm that 
specializes in Lifestyle Manage­
ment.
Described by Cassella, Lifestyle 
Management is essentially time 
management applied to everyday 
activities.
“A lot of time we waste in doing 
everyday things such as getting 
the car repaired, or working in
internship
the kitchen [can be used construc­
tively],” she said.
The internship program will be 
open to all graduate and under­
graduate students with prefer­
ences given to those with skills in 
marketing, computer applica­
tions, statistics, and Italian or 
French.
The results of the data compila­
tion will be used in an upcoming 
book that Fortino says is a “pro­
jected best seller.”
There are approxiamately 15 
positions for students on the re­
search team and the program will 
last approximately six months: 
late January to late July. Cas­
sella is still talking to the statis­
tics department about credit for
program
the internship.
In addition to the internship 
program, Fortino & Associates 
will be holding a discussion and 
brainstorming session on time 
saving techniques.
This panel of students will go 
on a nationwide tour, appearing 
on television and radio talkshows. 
The decision to travel outside 
Pittsburgh will be left up to the 
individual students. The tour will 
begin in mid-February.
If you are interested in the in­
ternship, forward a resume to 
Fortino & Associates, located at 
2889 Glenmore Ave, Suite 1000, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15216 
or contact Lynn Cassella at 344- 
8805 or at her home at 682-3955.
JASON SPEAKS
by Jason Lee Smith
Cats are-small furry reptiles 
closely related to snakes and vi­
pers. They have coexisted harmo­
niously with mankind for centu­
ries, primarily because of their 
soft fur, their loyalty, and the fact 
; that they are very unappetizing 
when broiled.
Cats were first domesticated in 
;the tenth century B.C. by the 
Egyptians, who revered them as 
gods. This is true today only in 
certain households. Domesticated 
cats next surfaced in the Roman 
Empire, where they were bred for 
their ferocity, trained, and then 
used in the Gladiatorial Games. 
The reader is no doubt aware how,

Cat On A Hot Tin Roof sizzles into Pittsburgh

Cat On A Hot Tin Roof runs the 
risk of falling victim to its own 
success and reputation. If you 
have not yet seen the hit movie 
starring Elizabeth Taylor and 
iPaul Newman, then maybe you 
caught the more recent produc­
tion with Jessica Lange and 
Tommy Lee Jones.
Even if you have not read or 
seen the play, chances are you 
(have heard some of the hype about 
this Pulitzer Prize winner. At any 
rate, a professional production of 
Cat has lots of history and pres­
tige to live up to.
Considered one of the three best 
¡plays written by one of America’s 
greatest playwrights, Tennesse 
Williams, Cat lies at the pinnacle
of modem theater. Which means 
that it is perpetually in danger of 
taking a tremendous fall. One 
factor helps new productions from 
disappointing discemingtheater- 
goers: This play is never the same 
from production to production. 
Yes, in a sense that is true of all 
plays, but the differences in Cat 
go beyond changes in the cast or 
set.
According to the late Williams, 
when the play was first produced 
in 1955 the director Elia Kazan 
had three major criticisms. “One, 
he felt that Big Daddy was too 
vivid and important a character 
to disappear from the play except 
as an offstage cry after the second 
act curtain; two, he felt that the 
character of Brick should undergo 
some apparent mutation as a 
result of the virtual vivisection
iTiikiioci 11511c/ luui icay uencuum V/Biuci
Kathleen Turner seen here in a more relaxed state as Maggie, the cat, in Williams’s Cat On A Hot Tin Roof.
that he undergoes in his inter­
view with his father in Act Two. 
Three, he felt that the character 
of Margaret, while he understood 
that I sympathized with her and 
liked her myself, should be, if 
possible, more clearly sympa­
thetic to an audience,” said Wil­
liams.
With these suggestions in mind, 
Williams completely rewrote the 
third act, creating the Broadway 
version of the play. Wisely, he 
held on to the original version of 
the play, also. Later, under pres­
sure from Hollywood big shots,
Williams once again rewrote his 
masterpiece to fit the tamer style 
of typical films in the late fifties.
The current cast would like 
audiences to know that they have 
resurrected the original version 
of this drama. This is Cat On A 
Hot Tin Roof the way Williams
intended it.
When the lights go down the 
audience is instantly transported 
to the rich, steamy south. A tre­
mendous bedroom takes up most 
of the stage complete with a can­
opy bed decked with satiny, 
salmon colored sheets and a glit­
tery chandelier. A pair of shut­
ters open to a spacious terrace 
and on this night at the Pollit 
residence an oversized moon 
sends dramatic beams of silver- 
white light through the branches 
of a pair of willow trees.
Kathleen Turner as Maggie 
bursts through a set of doors and 
is greeted by enthusiastic ap­
plause. In the next few hours she 
will prove herself worthy of this 
appreciation. Turner admitted 
that she has wanted this role for 
a long time. She seems a natural 
for the part. The beautiful actress 
has a deep, sensual voice that 
audiences may associate with her 
work as Jessica Rabbit in Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit ? Add some 
southern charm and she becomes 
the quintessential Maggie.
Still, Turner could not have 
delivered such an outstanding

How to escape 
from February hell
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Managing Editor
February’s bitter days are 
nearly here. The shortest, dark­
est, most all-around lousy month 
of the year has come back again, 
teasing us with the all-too-rare 
bright spots of the Beaux Arts 
Ball and Valentine’s Day — ac­
tually, if you’ve got no Ball ticket 
and no Valentine, February can 
be 28 days of unabridged hell.
Hell, that is, unless you’re a 
film fan. The Pittsburgh 
Playhouse’s Film Repertory has 
got a February schedule that 
will help kick those midwinter 
.blues, and it’s only a bus ride (or 
half-hour walk) away from 
campus. Most films show twice 
a night at 7:30 and 9:30 pm.
The league of fine February 
films marches in on Thursday, 
when the Playhouse presents 
Jean-Jacques Annaud’s interna­
tional hit The Bear. This film, 
which garnered awards and ac­
claim in its European showings, 
is the French version of Gentle 
Ben meets My Bodyguard. A 
young bear, having lost his 
mother to human killers, is be­
friended by another bear, this 
one a humongous 8-foot behe­
moth. Although it may sound a 
bit simple-minded, The Bear has 
charmed audiences the world
over with its spectacular cinema­
tography and touching story. 
(Rated PG.)
Starting Friday, director Ste­
ven Soderbergh’s debut feature 
sex, lies, and videotape settles in 
for a week-long run. (Incidentally, 
it’s also playing in DH2210 this 
Friday — a coincidence?) This 
sensual, postmodern drama stars 
CMU drama alumna Laura San 
Giacomo, model-tumed-actress 
Andie MacDowell, Peter Gal­
lagher, and James Spader as the 
players in a highly charged game 
of, “Who’s seducing who, and 
why?” Soderbergh won big at 
Cannes and the film is headed for 
art-house legend status—you’ve 
got at least 18 chances to see it, so 
there’s no excuse. (Rated R, runs 
through February 8.)
Another interesting scheduling 
“coincidence” comes along on 
Friday, February 9 — both the 
Playhouse and DH2210 will be 
airing Robin Williams’ dramatic 
tour de force of1989, Peter Weir’s 
Dead Poets Society. With a cast of 
fresh young faces (including erst- 
while CMU student Ethan 
Hawke) as the students of a New 
England prep school circa 1959, 
and Williams as the weird Eng­
lish teacher, the combination is 
devastatingly good cinema. 
(Rated PG, showing at 7:30 and 
9:40 pm.)

CMU alumna Laura San Giacomo (left), seen here in the 1984 CMU 
Drama production of The Greeks, stars in the award-winning sex,

Beaux Arts-goers will miss one 
of the month’s best on February 
10, as Spike (She’s Gotta Have It, 
School Daze) Lee’s Do The Right 
Thing storms into Oakland. (Don’t 
panic — it’s also coming to 
DH2210, on February 24.) Lee’s 
trademark style explodes onto the 
screen in a morality play of racial 
tensions in the Bedford- 
Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. 
Starring Lee as pizza delivery 
man Mookie and Danny Aiello as 
his white boss Sal, Do The Right 
Thing is featured prominently on 
every critic’s “Ten Best” and “Ten 
Most Controversial”lists forl989.
(Rated R, showing at 7:30 and 
9:45 pm.)
“Hold it!” I hear you cry. “If 
these films are coming to 
campus, where admission is a 
buck, why go all the way down 
to the Playhouse and pay $3 
for the same movie?” Good 
question, and there’s a good 
answer — quality. The differ­
ence between seeing a film in 
DH2210 and seeing the same 
film in the Playhouse is like 
the difference between mas­
turbation and sex. Once you’ve

A Walk in the Woods 
is no stroll in the park
By A.S. GOLDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
One of the privileges of being a 
revered and powerful theatre 
critic is the ability to damage a 
production’s ticket sales irrepa­
rably with one vitriolic turn of a 
phrase. “It sucked” will do the 
trick.
On the flipside, there’s the 
narcissistic allure of writing syco­
phantic blather with the reward 
of being immortalized in the 
annals of local theatre blurbdom: 
“ ‘The Pittsburgh Playhouse’s 
production of A Walk in the Woods 
is a frivolous celebration of life — 
Run, don’t Walk, to the box office’ 
says The Tartan’s A. S. Goldman.”
Ah, but the thrill is cheap, and 
there’s no cash involved. All too 
often the production in question 
is too mediocre to inspire in the 
critic the lust to crush or fondle. 
The instinct is to tap out “It was 
decent” and pack up the word 
processor for the night. When this 
is the case, the mighty critic must 
humble himself by reporting on 
lighting, or the set (or the perils of 
being a revered and powerful 
theatre critic), if only to fulfill his 
1,000 word copy minimum.
First we will address the set. As 
the trees indicate, there is a for­
est on stage, and as the text im­
plies, this forest resides some­
where outside of Geneva. In this 
Genevan forest there is a bench;
!THEAuME .EvrEI—
A WALK IN THE WOODS. Two diplo­
mats, a Soviet and an American, 
escape tension and protocol of the 
formal talks by taking walks in the 
woods. A play by Lee Blessing, di­
rected by Lee Sankowich, with Tom 
Atkins and Jeff Howell. At the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse Theatre Center, 
222 Craft Avenue, Oakland. Per­
formances until February 11. Call 
621-4445 for reservations and in­
formation.
this is the bench that American 
diplomat JohnHoneyman and his 
Soviet counterpart Andrey 
Botvinnik will sit on as they dis­
cuss nuclear proliferation and say 
things like, “Work without hope 
is a dry thing.” The forest and the 
bench are present throughout the 
year of walking in the woods that 
the play chronicles. They are also 
a good indication of the scope of 
this production.
As an archetype, the forest 
suggests something big — bigger 
than man and bigger than the 
world man has built for himself. 
The forest is where the secret of 
human evil is revealed to Young 
Goodman Brown, and it is where 
Hester Prynne and Reverend 
Dimmesdale find refuge from the 
harshness and hypocrisy of Puri­
tan culture. In Lee Blessing’s A

Part adventure, part humor, but all fun: Tremors rocks
By KEVIN BARNEY  -------------------------------------------~“—  Tartan Features Editor !04vrE .EvrEI!
??? TREMORS. (PG-13) A small town in the middle of Nevada is suddenly attacked 
by several large intelligent underground creatures. Starring Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, and 
Michael Gross. Directed by Ron Underwood. At Kings Court, and Showcase East in 
Monroeville.
Tremors will probably not win an 
Academy award. It will probably not be 
a big box office success, either; nor will it 
be regarded as a movie that will outlast 
generations.
Even so, Tremors is worth seeing. It’s 
a movie that is part adventure and part 
humor. Some people might say that it is 
a horror movie or a science fiction movie, 
but neither category really fits.
The movie starts out when the small 
town of Perfection, Nevada (population 
. 14) is suddenly and inexplicably attacked 
by several large underground creatures.
The creatures are intelligent (almost 
as smart as the characters, which doesn’t 
say much for the creatures), carnivorous 
; (eating any character who doesn’t really 
belong in the movie anymore), and very 
fast (they cruise). They can sense vibra­
tions, such as footsteps, and they use 
this method to find their dinner — the 
inhabitants of the town.
The town of Perfection is soon cut off 
from the rest of the world and the re­
gaining inhabitants realize they have
to get out before they all die of starvation 
or get eaten by the “snakeoids” or “gra- 
boids”; two names given to the creatures 
by the town populace.
One of the aspects of the movie that 
makes it enjoyable is the characters of 
the town. The main characters, Val 
McKee (Kevin Bacon from Footloose, 
She’s Having a Baby, and Diner) and 
Earl Basset (Fred Ward from Remo Wil­
liams and Silkwood) are two handymen 
that are not the smartest guys in the 
world. The rest of the town would also 
never be candidates for a Nobel Prize.
Two other characters who add a lot to 
the movie are the survivalists, Burt and 
Heather Gummer, played by Michael 
Gross and Reba McEntire, who are gung 
ho about actually meeting something 
that they can use their vast collection of 
guns against.
Tremors is reminiscent of the old 
movies in the fifties and sixties where a 
certain type of creature attacked a small 
town. In these types of films, there was 
always a scientist of some kind with 
some type of female companion who ran 
around the town keeping themselves 
alive until they finally dispatched the 
creature(s).
In Tremors some flavoring from those 
movies is still present; for example Val 
(not a scientist, but a main character) 
gets the girl, played by Finn Carter, a 
student studying seismology in the des­
ert. Apologies for revealing part of the 
ending, but if you go to see this movie for 
the “romance” in it, you are going to be 
disappointed.

sist of what was not resurrected from the

On A Hot Roof.

performance without the under­
standing and respect she holds 
for Maggie. “Maggie is so brave. 
She doesn’t ever seem to quite 
lose spirits at any point ... It’s 
quite delightful to be playing her. 
She’s so alive! She changes so fast 
and thinks so fast.”
Turner may attract the audi­
ences, but her role is really a 
supporting one. The bulk of the 
action centers around Brick, who 
remains in view of the audience 
for all but about two minutes of 
the entire show. Brick causes most 
of the controversy in the house, 
whether it’s by drinking all day, 
trying to jump hurdles at two in 
the morning, or refusing to sleep 
with his wife. When family 
members are in pain, they yell for 
Brick.
Daniel Hugh Kelly shines as 
the emotionally drained former 
athlete. Brick becomes increas­
ingly drunk as the show pro­
gresses, but Kelly plays this with 
restraint. Brick is never obviously 
intoxicated, with slurred speech 
and exaggerated movements. 
Rather, he sings bits of songs to 
himself. He moves with more 
deliberation and does not hear or 
respond to everything that goes 
on around him. Although Brick 
has grown numb to the world, 
Kelly manages to give him dig­
nity and to reveal some of those 
feelings that Brick has repressed 
for so long.
Kelly is no stranger to Pitts­
burgh. He went to school here 
back in the early seventies and 
while the trip back has been hec­
tic, he is glad to see the positive 
changes that have occurred 
throughout Pittsburgh. “The fact 
that the steel industry suffered 
the damage that it did and that 
this city was able to not just sur­
vive that but to really grow .„I 
think you guys should be proud,” 
he said.
The slim Polly Holiday had to 
put on a lot of padding to play 
hefty Big Mama, but she did not 
have to put on an accent like her 
fellow cast members. She recalls 
that “The southern accent gave 
me my big break when I played 
Flo [on the series Alice] on televi­
sion, so I’m very thankful for it.”
Director Howard Davies envi­
sioned Holiday in the role and 
contacted her via her agent. Al­
though Holiday doubted that she 
would get the part, she travelled 
from Alabama to New York for 
the audition. When she learned 
the next day that she had been 
cast in the play, “It was like a 
Christmas gift for me.”
It takes more than a believable 
accent to give a convincing per­
formance as Big Mama, the most 
unselfish character in the play. 
She tends to be happy when those 
around her are happy. While her 
easy-going nature may make her 
seem naive, she does notice the 
troubles around her; at one point 
she says to Maggie, “Something’s 
not right. You’re childless and my
son drinks.” Holiday expertly 
manages a convincing blend of 
cheerfulness, concern, and trag­
edy.
Actor Charles Durning claims 
that he attempts to diet “every 
twenty minutes.” At one point in 
his career he lost over one hundred 
pounds and a few jobs along with 
that. Once again his weight has 
helped to bring him an important 
role.
Durning plays the ornery, vul­
gar, angry Big Daddy, trapped in 
a difficult situation. With twenty- 
eight thousand acres of land, he 
either has to decide to give it to 
his favorite son, Brick, an alco­
holic caught in a downward spi­
ral, or his responsible but irritat­
ing son Gooper.
Durning does superbly in this 
critical part. Like his son Brick, 
Big Daddy does not show emotion 
easily. When he finally does open 
himself up to Brick, the audience 
sees moments of self-doubt, dis­
gust with the world, and most of 
all, fear of death. Durning shows 
this side of Big Daddy but forces 
the audience to respect him even 
more for his perseverance.
Acting along side these four cast 
members could be intimidating, 
to say the least. Still, none'of the 
other cast members are ever in 
the shadow of their famous col­
leagues. Debra Jo Rupp provides 
comic tension with a shrill south­
ern twang and a holier-than thou 
attitude as Brick’s sister-in-law, 
Mae.
As Gooper, Ray Gill actuallj 
lets the audience see the full ex­
tent of Big Daddy’s dilemma 
While sympathies always seem 
to lie with Brick, Gill subtly djs. 
plays Gooper’s frustration and 
pain. By using something a| 
simple as a facial expression ora 
stance, Gill brings out a side of 
Gooper that his lines only hint at 
At one point Big Mama screams 
“I want Brick! Where’s Brick? 
Where is my only son?” •
In response to this, Gooper 
stands with his hands in his pock- 
ets, his head slightly bent do\vi£ 
and cries out, “What does that- 
make me?”
The special effects in this profl 
duction are magnificent. During 
the course of the evening, the giant 
moon moves slowly down the sky 
and goes from a bright white to a 
muted yellow. Fireworks light up,_ 
the stage and the audience seel 
the actual sparks in the sky. The 
most spectacular point is when a 
giant burst of thunder resounds 
through the theater and the 
massive willow trees sway vio­
lently in the background.
Everything in this play is flaw­
less, down to the very last detail. 
Go to see Kathleen Turner, or 
Daniel Hugh Kelly, or a beautiful 
set, or some breathtaking special", 
effects. The reason is not impor­
tant, just go. True to its heritage] 
this production of Cat On A Hoi 
Tin Roof sets a new standard for 
any people who may choose to put 
on this play in the future.
NBC’s Grand is far from living up to its title
By ANDREW WHEELER
Tartan Staffwriter
Remember Soap, the funny and 
biting satire of soap operas that 
introduced us to such stars as 
Katherine Helmond and Robert 
Guillaume? The writing was top- 
rate, the characters were weird, 
and the show went a long way in 
stretching the barriers of what 
was acceptable on network televi­
sion. Many loyal viewers were 
upset when it was canceled in 
1981.
Now, in 1990, it’s back. Well, 
sort of. No matter what the crea­
tors of Grand say about how ex­
citing, new, and different their 
show is, the truth is they’re trying 
to do Soap in a different setting. 
Unfortunately, they have a long 
way to go before they can match 
the quality and humor of that 
program.
Grand is the story of three 
families living in Grand, Penn-
!TEaEvr8r4g .EvrEI—
??72GRAND. Thursday, 9:30 pm, channel 11 (NBC). Comedy set in the 
fictional town of Grand, Pennsylvania. The story focuses on three different 
households: house cleaner Janice Pasetti and her daughter Edda; 
newlyweds Tom and Carol Anne; and Harris Weldon and his son Norris. 
Starring Pamela Reed (Janice), Sara Rue (Edda), Michael McKean (Tom), 
Bonnie Hunt (Carol Anne), John Randolph (Harris Weldon), John Neville 
(Desmond), and Joel Murray (Norris).
sylvania, a town depending on 
one company — Weldon Piano 
Works—for its livelihood. Pamela 
Reed stars as Janice Pasetti, who 
lives with her daughter Edda in a 
small trailer home. Janice cleans 
house for two families: recently 
married Tom and Carol Anne, 
and Harris Weldon, Carol Anne’s 
uncle and owner of the Piano 
Works.
Reed does well as Janice, a 
woman whose husband walked 
out on her three years earlier, 
leaving her to raise a daughter by 
herself. The best scenes so far are
those that take place in her tiny 
trailer. Sara Rue does a pretty 
good job as Janice’s sarcastic, 
overweight daughter.
On to the newlyweds: Carol 
Anne (Bonnie Hunt) manages to 
line up a job for Tom (Michael 
McKean) at her uncle’s factory, 
and, in the first episode, Tom 
manages to lose it. Since then, all 
of Tom’s time seems to be taken 
up with getting his job back. I 
mean all of his time. So much so 
that Carol Anne, sex-starved to 
start with, becomes suspicious 
thatthere’s another woman. Both
McKean (well remembered as 
Lenny on Laverne and Shirley) 
and Hunt do the best they can 
with the so-so material they’re 
given.
The most boring and predict­
able scenes occur at the Weldon 
mansion. Harris Weldon himself 
is the stereotypical old, rich man 
who salivates over young girls. 
Desmond is the stereotypical wise­
cracking British butler (sorry, 
Desmond, you’re no Benson). 
Apparently, the two really care 
about each other, but a scene that 
tries to show this close relation­
ship seems forced.
The only possible bright spot in 
the Weldon household is Weldon’s 
spoiled-rotten son, Norris. In the 
premiere, Norris announces that 
he’s finally decided what to do 
with his life: stop thinking. He 
proceeds to sit down and stare 
straight ahead with a blank look 
on his face for the rest of the 
episode. In subsequent weeks, he’s
had some of the funniest lines on 
the show.
A show like this depends on 
writing more than anything else, 
and at present, the writing is not 
up to par. There are some funny 
moments, but they occur sporadi­
cally. Except for Janice, the char­
acters are one-dimensional and 
their actions are predictable.
Actually, that’s not all bad. It’s 
important to remember that this 
show isn’t (or at least shouldn’t 
be) striving for stark realism. It’s 
not attempting to become China 
Beach or The Wonder Years. To be 
successful, it simply has to be 
funny.
And here is one of the traps the 
producers might be.setting up for 
themselves: it seems as though 
they believe that the characters 
actually should be realistic. That’s 
a big mistake. Much of Soap’s 
success was due to its broad char­
acterizations and its willingness 
to get involved in incredibly
farfetched adventures (for ex­
ample, the set of episodes where,, 
Burt Campbell is abducted by 
aliens, and his clone is sent back 
to Earth). Grand needs to be 
outrageous. Right now, the char­
acters are just too sane.
Grand has a real chance to be aj 
success. If the writing becomes 
consistently funnier and the situ­
ations a little wilder, this show 
could find a healthy audience (of 
course, it doesn’t hurt that it 
follows Cheers, one of the hottest^] 
shows on television).
But, for now, it needs work. 
Grand was #5 for the week of its 
premiere. If the quality doesn't 
improve soon, viewers might just 
find something better to do 
Thursday nights.

able and uncrowded seating, and 
wonderfully audible stereo sound 
(hint, hint, AB and SDC), you’ll 
be convinced that $3 for quality is 
better than $1 for a snowjob.
Enough polemics—on with the 
previews. On Monday, February 
12, Jean-Jacques Beineix’ Betty 
Blue comes in for one night; far 
too short a stay for such a power­
ful film. Beatrice Dalle stars as 
the adorable butunbalancedlover 
of the title, which is not particu­
larly accurate to the original 
French title of 37.5, or body tem­
perature on the Celsius scale. It 
sounds confusing, but see it any­
way. (Not rated, but includes 
nudity and adult themes. Show­
ing at 7:30 and 9:40. In French 
with subtitles.)
On Valentine’s Day, February 
14, the film adaptation of the hit 
play Shirley Valentine comes, 
rather appropriately, to the Play­
house. Directed by Lewis Gilbert 
and starring Tony award-winner 
Pauline Collins, this film provides 
an intensely funny look inside the 
life of a British housewife. (Rated

A unique photo exhibition opens 
at Blatent Image • Silver Eye

A pin-up show? An exhibition of 
bathing beauties and surfer 
hunks, right? Cheesecake photo­
graphs of Marilyn Monroe, the 
Chippendales, and Sports Illus­
trated swimsuit models, right? 
Wrong.
Sponsored by Blatent Image • 
Silver Eye, Pin-Up Show is liter­
ally just that, one in which any­
one is invited to to stop by, stick 
up their photographs, and bask 
in the glory of a gallery show. The 
show is a completely relaxed 
event; participants don’t have to 
be students or members of any 
particular organization. However, 
there are a few of rules, after all, 
this is real life.
Works must be hung with push­
pins available from thé gallery 
for 250 each. Nails are also avail­
able for framed works, at a fee of 
500 each. And while there are no 
stipulations governing the size 
and number of prints, it is sug­
gested that room be left for other

participants. In other words, this 
is not to be a one-person show.
Pin-Up Show differs from most 
photo exhibitions in a number of 
ways. For example, the opening, 
held Saturday, was more than a 
celebration of a new show. It was 
also the construction of the show, 
as participants hung their photo­
graphs while spectators began 
meandering about, contemplat­
ing their efforts.
Another exciting difference is 
that nothing is permanent; par­
ticipants have the option of add­
ing or removing photographs as 
the show progresses. Not only does 
this prevent the public from be­
coming bored, it also offers people 
the chance to get involved at any 
point. That is, if space remains 
anyone can become a participant.
The show is stress-free as there

MUSIC IN REVIEW
by Dan Bidwa
The King Missile show is off. 
Stay home instead.
;0r maybe not, since you can 
clieck out the new exhibit at 
Forbes Gallery instead. Marcela 
Silva and Hannah Welsh are a 
whole batch of rock-type art stuff 
portraits of rock stars and the 
like. Axl Rose, Jerry Garcia, the 
whole bunch. Definitely the most 
unique show of the year. They’re 
installing themselves as well, for 
the whole week (that means 
they’re living there, dummy). So 
stop by, give them a cookie and 
8ay hi. You might want to look at 
tho.pictures too, since they’re quite nice.
Public Enemy is coming to Pitts­
burgh for the first time ever on
February 1 (that’s Thursday). 
After all the Professor Griff flap 
of the summer (Griff will have his 
own solo vinyl coming out some­
time this summer), Public Enemy 
has broken up, reformed, and 
somehow made it into a city that 
managed to turn the Grateful 
Dead show into a battle zone. 
Expect to see a LOT of cop cars 
around the Mosque Thursday 
night, and, while you’re looking 
at all of them, think about just 
how much pull DiCaesar-Engler 
must have in this town (they own 
the Syria Mosque, and do most of 
the shows there and at the Civic 
Arena). Public Enemy will be 
playing with Biz Markie and some 
other groups I can’t remember 
right now. Expect tickets to be 
astronomically priced.
Battered Citizens have their 
debut album to add to the grow­
ing pile of recent Pittsburgh vi­

On February 16 and 17, The 
Second Animation Celebration — 
The Movie makes its return to the 
Playhouse. Back by popular 
demand after a long run in No­
vember of last year, the Celebra­
tion features clips of “The 
Simpsons,” Matt (Life In Hell) 
Greening’s post-nuclear family, 
and Tin Toy and Knickknack, a 
pair of computer-animated shorts 
from John Lassiter’s Pixar com­
pany. In 1989, Tin Toy was the 
first computer-animated film to 
win an Academy award. (Not 
rated.)
On Monday, February 19, Terry 
CMonty Python's Flying Circus, 
Time Bandits) Gilliam’s bizarre
futurist fantasy Brazil plays two 
shows. Gilliam creates a magnifi­
cently ridiculous world of terror­
ist repairmen, Orwellian bureauc­
racy, and ductwork. As the film 
careens from drop-dead funny to 
surreal and terrifying, it’s easy to 
see why many consider it one of 
the best films of the ’80s. (Rated 
PG—13, showing at 7:30 and 9:45.)
On February 23, there will be 
one (crowded) showing of Philip 
Kaufman’s brilliant adaptation of 
Milan Kundera’s 77*e Unbearable 
Lightness Of Being. Kundera’s 
novel, chronicling the sexual and 
political adventures of a 
Czechloslovakian surgeon (played 
by Daniel Day-Lewis, star of My
Left Foot and My Beautiful Laun­
derette) in the midst of the Prague 
Spring of1968, becomes especially 
poignant in light of recent events 
in Eastern Europe. The film, also 
starring Juliette Binoche and 
Lena Olin, captures the tone and 
the flavor of the novel in a well­
paced and entrancing cinematic 
narrative. Although the film is 
long (173 minutes), it goes by all 
too fast. Mark your calendars now.

and then I grab hold of an

orange plasticene divider tab and 
I flip back over to the back where 
it says “Objectives.” Now. At the 
top of the first page, it says “Ob­
jectives This Month,” and then 
it’s divided into “Area of Interest: 
Career, Future, Self.” So, for 
example, if I’m gonna state an 
objective, I just use one of the 
stickers — I’ll choose “Wines.” 
And then you’ve got to fill in 
underneath “Wines” what you’re 
gonna do in the area of wines, or 
else you’ll never get anything done 
in life. So I wrote “Drink Them.” 
But then you move on down the 
column under “Wines” to where it 
says “Benefits/Obstacles.” That’s 
where I wrote “Getting Drunk”— 
actually, that could be a benefit or 
an obstacle, so it doesn’t exactly 
work—but over on the other side 
of that same page it says “Steps.” 
So I wrote in there “Go to liquor 
store.” You see how this is simpli­
fying my life? And then over next 
to that it says “When?” And so I 
wrote in “Get your hiney over 
there right now.” And then it say s 
“Priority?” with a check mark. So 
I put down “Pretty damn impor­
tant.” And so there is an example 
of one completed task in the Day 
Runner. Iwon’tforget to get drunk 
on wine on February 4.
But that’s not all you can do 
with this mother. If you flip back 
to the front, it says “Projects,” and 
this is for your long-term career 
planning. You just write in there
some goal like “Win the Battle of 
the Monster Trucks,” and then 
underneath it you describe “Plan 
of action”:
“1. Get somebody to give me a 
big pile of money.
“2. Pay somebody to build me a 
truck.
“3. Buy one ofthose orange crash 
helmets with a chin strap.”
But then you’re probly think­
ing, “Okay, Joe Bob, but what 
happens after I get the master 
plan done, but then I can’t re­
member what it is I’m trying to 
accomplish?” Easy! You cross- 
reference “Projects” with the sec- 
tioninthemiddlecalled “MEMO­
RY,” where you write in stuff like, 
“Your wife’s name is Susan, not 
Shirley.” Then it has about 50 
boxes to fill in under “MEMO­
RY,” and each box is... actually, I 
can’t remember exactly what the 
“MEMO-RY” section is for. I sug­
gest you just rip that sucker out.
Now what have we learned 
today? We can find out the an­
swer to that by turning to our tab 
index and flipping up the letter 
“L” for “Learn.” And, that’s inter­
esting, it’s blank! So, see, we’ve 
leamednothingtoday, but I think 
you know and I know that now, 
today, in this new year in a new 
decade, it’s time to get organized, 
get your life together, start some 
advance planning, get some ob­
jectives and some action agendas, 
spend all night doing your check­
book, so we can have some fun in 
the nineties.
Remember to write down all 
the fun before youhave it, though.
And speaking of the letter “L,” 
the luscious love melons of Lin­
nea Quigley areback on the screen 
in Sexbomb, except that she’s no 
longer Linnea Quigley. She’s 
billed simply as “Linnea.” I knew 
this would happen. It happened 
to Betsy Russell. It happened to 
Sybil Panning. It happened to
Jamie Lee Curtis. Right at the 
moment when they achieve drive- 
in superstardom, when they be­
come true Queens of the B’s, they 
suddenly decide to “get serious 
about my career.” They change 
their name. They demand script 
approval. They only take “star 
vehicles.” And the next thing 
that’ll happen — mark my words
— as Linnea will say, “I will no 
longer pop my top on camera.”
Fortunately, she pretty much 
lets her breasts do the talking in 
Sexbomb, which is the drive-in 
version of Body Heat, only in­
stead of Kathleen Turner trying 
to kill Richard Crenna with Wil­
liam Hurt’s help, we’ve got Delia 
Sheppard trying to kill Robert 
Quarry with Stuart Benton’s help. 
Actually, I think you could of just 
cast these people in Body Heat 
and had just as good a movie.
Sexbomb is another one ofthose 
behind-the-scenes B-movie- 
within-a-B-movie movies that 
started with the original Holly­
wood Boulevard in the seventies. 
We’ve only had about 57 of these 
since then, so there’s still a whole 
lot we learn. Lou Lurrod is the 
“technical advisor” on the movie 
“I Rip Your Flesh With Pliers, 
Part 2: The Return of Ethan.” He 
gets fired by evil money-grubbing 
B-movie producer King Faraday
— until Faraday loses his script­
writer on his next movie, “Were­
wolves in Heat,” and hires Lou to 
do the job.
So much for plot. Most of the 
movie is Lou making the sign of 
the triplewinged flying gopher 
with Faraday’s wife, Candy, 
played by the platinum-blonde, 
twin-blimped Delia Sheppard.
So where, you might be won­
dering, is Linnea Qui... I mean, 
Linnea? She’s exactly where we 
would expect, wandering around 
through the background with her 
breasts hanging out. She’s got

Counseling and Student Development Center, a Division of Student Affairs
By STEPHEN TOROK
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Wednesday night at the 
A.J. Palumbo center, Richard 
Marx debuted the American por­
tion of his world tour. Though just 
finishing a six month tour of 
Japan, Australia, Canada, and 
Europe, plus a Monday night 
performance at the American 
Music Awards in Los Angeles, 
Marx sounded far from burned 
out.
In fact, he sounded inspired.
The near-capacity crowd was 
on its feet from the first guitar riff 
of his chart climbing “Too Late to 
Say Goodbye,” and Marx never 
let them sit back down.
After ripping through a funky 
version of his number-one hit 
“Satisfied,” Marx quietly said 
hello to the audience. Through­
out the night, he spoke only to in­
troduce songs, band members, or 
to deliver tiresome well rehearsed 
lines.
The problem with Marx is that 
he tries too hard to be the bad boy 
rocker. It doesn’t suit him. There 
is an innocence and honesty that 
seems to exude from Marx. When

Canada, and Euope. Last Wednes­
day night in the A.J. Palumbo Cen­
ter.
he plays bad boy, it only makes 
him seem inaccessible to the 
audience.
Though his lush, clear voice 
carried him beautifully through 
all of his popular ballads such as 
“Right Here Waiting” and my 
personal favorite “Endless Sum­
mer Nights,” he really shined 
during the rock ‘n’ roll tunes.
His voice, turning gritty when 
he wanted it to, screamed above 
the band on his self-admitted fa­
vorite tune, “Nothing You CanDo 
About It.”
When originally recording his 
second album, Repeat Offender, 
Marx assembled an assortment 
of the hottest studio musicians in 
Los Angeles. It stands to reason 
that the quality of musicianship 
would slip with a road band. Not 
so with this road band. These
guys were among the best back­
ing musicians I have ever heard 
in a pop concert.
While his bass, drums, and 
keyboard players laid down a 
strong, steady groove, his saxo­
phonist and two guitarists, using 
wireless microphones, roamed the 
stage and ripped through solos 
that would rival anyone in the 
business.
His lead guitarist took ex­
tended solos during “Have Mercy” 
and “Nothing You Can Do About 
It” while his rhythm guitarist 
bluesed it up during “Real World” 
and took an inspired glass slide 
solo in “Don’t Mean Nothing.”
The unsung hero of the night, 
however, was saxophonist Steve 
Grove. His sharp, concentrated 
sound easily cut through the band 
in Marx saxophone tunes “End­
less Summer Nights” and “Real 
World,” as well as “Remember 
Manhattan,” “Heart on the Line,” 
and “Don’t Mean Nothing,” in 
which he took extended solos.
When Marx announced that 
Grove was a new band member 
and this was his first perform­
ance, he received a five minute 
ovation. Marx joked with him
about this and it lightened up the 
rebellious tone that Marx at­
tempted to set earlier. In the fu­
ture, I expect that he will com­
pletely shed his self-proclaimed 
bad boy image.
Chicago bom Marx, professing 
his soul and blues roots, tradi­
tionally performs at least one 
cover tune. His performance of 
Bill Withers’ “Ain’t No Sunshine” 
was excellent. No one who heard 
this performance could deny 
Marx’s soul singing ability.
He took a long vocal solo where 
his voice moved with ease and 
precision between falsetto and the 
natural register. Marx took a 
second solo of this type during the 
last song of the regular concert 
“Don’t Mean Nothing.”
In general, pop music is widely 
criticized in college. I’ve never 
really understood this phenome­
non, but if you can stop yourself 
from condemning Marx simply 
because he’s popular and really 
listen to his music, you will begin 
to appreciate his exceptional tal­
ent.
Iflast Wednesday is any indica­
tion, Richard Marx is going to be 
around for a long time.

After putting on such a dynamite performance you would think RichaJ 
Marx might take some time out to shave.

Dhi/hnuco'c a waife ¡n the Woods trips over its own feet
Discussing everything under the weather, Jeffery Howell and Tom 
Atkins stop to gather flowers in A Walk in the Woods.
contiuned from page L11.
Walk in the Woods, Honeyman 
and Botvinnik too, seek refuge, 
only not from the stem social 
constraints of colonial New Eng­
land, but from the pressured pro­
ceedings of the Geneva arms talks. 
They relocate their negotiations 
from the lifeless conference room 
to the center of life itself.
Director Lee Sankowitz and set 
designer Dick Block choose not to 
view the forest in this Hawthor- 
nean light — Bambi is more ap­
propriate. Like the telephone 
poles they disguise as trees, their 
vision is thin and unconvincing. 
In the same manner that the 
bucketful of dead leaves dropped 
to the stage implies autumn in 
the vaguest way, the men before 
us rarely transcend the most 
general characterization.
We get the husky voice of the 
Russian and the buttoned-down 
attitude of the American, and 
usually nothing more. When 
Blessing’s script demands sharper 
focus, as is the case with 
Botvinnik’s scathing tirade on 
political game playing, the actors 
rise to the occasion, but at the cost 
of disorientation — we feel as if a 
cartoon character has for the 
moment become flesh and blood. 
The sudden addition of third 
dimension in character has the 
same awkward effect that a real 
tree spontaneously appearing in 
the forest of telephone poles would 
have.

The Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh Women’s Clan Scholarship 
Awards Committee will soon be interviewing women in order to select 
recipients for its 1990-91 awards
The Pittsburgh Women ’s Clan annually awards scholarships to deserving and qualified
Carnegie Mellon undergraduate women.
The following selection criteria will be used:
1. Student must currently be a junior, the award will be 
applied to the Fall tuition at Carnegie Mellon during 
her senior year.
2. Student must have a QPA of 2.80 or above.
3. Student should be active in school activities.
4. Student’s financial need and aid will also be taken 
into consideration.
Scholarship applications are now available in the Financial Aid Office.
Two scholarships will be awarded; a minimum of $1000 each 
The deadline for submission of the application is Wednesday, February 28, 1990
Applications should be returned to the Financial Aid Office, 2nd floor, Warner Hall.
The Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh Women’s Clan is comprised of Carnegie Mellon University alumni. 
They have maintained an active interest in Carnegie Mellon Activities and have been very 
generous in their support of time and money.
Jeffrey Howell as Honeyman 
and Tom Atkins as Botvinnik are, 
unfortunately, cute. Their mug­
ging and gesticulating make for a 
nice chuckle or two, but when the 
giggles subside so does the effec­
tiveness of Blessing’s lauded 
script. The production relies on 
the one-liners as substance in­
stead of using them, as Blessing 
intended, to drive an unsavory 
point home — as Honeyman puts 
it, “Idealism is no longer a choice 
for mankind, it is a necessity.” 
This line and the play’s message 
eventually get lost in the pleas­
ant but distractingvaudeville, and 
the audience goes home thinking 
“I hate brown suits” is the theme 
of the play.
Thematic emasculation aside, 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse’s A 
Walk in the Woods is fun theatre. 
More than a few laughs and a tug 
or two at the heartstrings are 
guaranteed.
Watching the worldly old Rus­
sian ruffle the feathers of the 
uptight American greenhorn is 
good for a smile, as is Honeyman’s 
recounting of his run-in with the 
Swiss police.
But, to return to the original 
dilemma, this leaves the revered 
and powerful critic with almost 
nothing. Faced with a blank page, 
desperation sets in and the ques­
tion is raised: How can you stretch 
“It was decent” out to fill two 
pages of copy? You have read the 
answer.

Houlihan’s offers the supreme dining experience
By arUu ,AHEHuEL8
tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
¦It is always a pleasure to go to 
{Joulihan’s. For all the times I 
have dined there, I do not believe 
t have ever found any reason to 
voice a complaint, and in all hon­
esty, that is the only restaurant I 
can confidently say that about.
Houlihan’s provides a relaxed, 
cozy atmosphere. The dim, soft 
lighting and the warm greens and 
browns that dominate the decor 
combine in such a way that makes 
you forget you are in a large, 
crowded restaurant. You can let 
ffiurselffeel thatyours is the only 
able there because it is so easy to 
Selieve. The tables and booths of 
loulihan’s are arranged on dif­
ferent levels and in no particular 
direction, so itis not so noticeable 
that they are attempting to fit as 
many people as possible in the 
space they have. More impor­
tantly, it adds to that feeling of 
separation andmdividuality, rare 
in restaurants today.
When you enter Houlihan’s, you 
can sit in the main dining area;
—Restaurant Review—
HOULIHAN'S. In the shops at Station Square. Appetizers range from $3.50 to $6.95; soups/salads 
$3.50 to $6.95; a la carte $7.50 to $11.25; premier dinners $10.75 to $15.75. Reservations are not 
necessary, but on busy nights there may be a long wait; call 232-0302. Visa, Mastercard, and American Express 
accepted. Hours: Monday through Thursday 11 am to 11 pm, Friday and Saturday 11am to 12:30 am, Sunday 
10:30 am to 10:30 pm; Sunday Brunch 10:30 am to 3 pm; Bar Monday through Sunday 11 am to 2 am.
Also notable are the Stuffed Po­
tato Skins.
For those who like to eat on the 
lighter, healthier side, Houlihan’s 
offers soups, salads, quiche, and 
combos of soups, salads, and 
sandwiches. Try the scrumptious 
French Onion Soup, always avail­
able. Or find a new favorite in the 
Chinese Chicken Salad; char­
grilled chicken combined with bell 
peppers, snow peas, red cabbage, 
mandarin oranges, fried rice 
noodles, and peanuts, all blended 
in a Chinese peanut dressing.
For lunch or dinner Houlihan’s 
serves specialties a la carte, or 
premier dinners, which come with 
your choice of soup or salad and 
any dessert. The menu boasts a 
tempting variety of chicken, 
shrimp, ribs, and steak, to men­
the stained glass windows keep 
you at a subtle distance from the 
shoppers outside. Or you may 
choose to dine a bit closer to the 
action. There is an area of tables 
sectioned off outside the main 
room where the visitors of Sta­
tion Square pass right by you.
You can easily spend half your 
meal discussing the eclectic de­
cor; the dining area itself is a 
conversation piece. The odds and 
ends that completely cover the 
walls and ledges of the restau­
rant appear to suggest that a 
collector lives somewhere within; 
gazing at these objects is like 
taking a walk through time. Mir­
rors, jugs, license plates, walk/ 
don’t walk signs, and street signs 
are examples of some ofthe treas­
ures. You can see a picture of a
ballerina on one wall and a bold 
color photo of Susan Anton on the 
next. Old time signs that adver­
tise Cadbury Chocolate and Texas 
Wills’s “Wild Woodbine” ciga­
rettes add to the charm. Even 
some ofthe tables and chairs vary 
in design.
Trust me, it all fits together 
quite harmoniously.
Houlihan’s updates its menu 
twice during the year, classifying 
it under the titles Spring/Sum­
mer and Fall/Winter. Right now, 
the Fall/Winter selectionis await­
ing you. Count on the friendly 
waiters and waitresses to start 
your meal off splendidly with one 
of the famous appetizers. One of 
the best is the Fried Provolone 
Cheese, better than any mozza­
rella stick you can buy anywhere.
tion a few. Without a doubt, 
Houlihan’s specialty is the Siz­
zling Fajitas; your choice of char­
grilled beef or chicken, or a combi­
nation of both, with bell peppers, 
red onion, pico de gallo, guaca­
mole, sour cream, cheddar cheese, 
and mild salsa served on ‘sizzhng’ 
hot skillets. When this dinner 
comes out of the kitchen, you can 
hear it sizzle all the way to its 
table from no matter where you 
are dining. It is something to 
watch as almost every head in the 
restauranttum to watch this dish 
make its journey. In addition to 
the dinners, Houlihan’s serves six 
kinds of burgers and various 
sandwiches, ranging from the 
Ultimate BLTto a California Club 
Croissant.
Complete the evening with a 
Houlihan’s dessert, if you have 
any room left. Choose the tradi­
tional New York Style Cheese­
cake, or if you are feeling bold, 
ask someone to share the Carmel 
Nut Crunch Pie with you. This is 
the ultimate in desserts: crushed 
snickers and vanilla ice cream in 
an Oreo cookie and peanut crumb
crust, served with caramel and 
hotfudge sauces. Close to Heaven 
on Earth.
Houlihan’s also offers a special 
Sunday Brunch. For $9.95 per 
person, you are entitled to your 
choice of entree as well as a choice 
of juice and unlimited trips to the 
Emporium Table. You can choose 
a specialty like Eggs Houlihan; 
toasted english muffin halves 
topped with grilled tomatoes, 
poached eggs, momay sauce and 
bacon, served with cheese pota­
toes. Or you may decide to try an 
omelette, like Joe’s Omelette; 
filled with cheese, tomatoes, scal­
lions, bell peppers, and mush­
rooms. There are also more com­
mon favorites like steak and eggs 
and various types of french toast.
Count on a warm reception upon 
your arrival at Houlihan’s and a 
fond farewell. These people know 
how to make you feel at home and 
are more than happy to serve you. 
After my dinner today I left feel­
ing I just had the best meal I have 
ever had. I know that upon my 
next visit the feeling will yet again 
return.

Reefer Madness and 
Sex Madness
Reefer Madness — Originally titled The Burning 
Question, and later, Tell Your Children, this film has 
been dubbed by some as the “granddaddy of bad 
films.” The basic plot is that one puff of marijuana can 
lead a fine, upstanding person to a life of doom (a 
typical view for the 1930s). The one and only redeem­
ing feature of this movie is the fact that the acting is 
so bad and the information about the use of mari­
juana is so erroneous that some people find this movie 
hysterical. However, treat this movie as you would 
any drug — use extreme caution.
Sex Madness—An “educational film” of the ’30s— 
that should say it all. The only thing the ’30s and sex 
have in common is the rumble seat. In the ’90s, we’re 
practicing “safe sex” as well as “safe movie viewing,” 
so you can probably miss this melodrama of morality 
and youth who have gone sex-wild. Once again, this 
movie was made with such seriousness that today it 
is often considered a comedy.
Both Reefer Madness and Sex Madness will be 
played at each showing.
At 6, 8:30,11 — No rating for either film

sex, lies, and videotape
This film throws a lawyer, his frigid wife, his 
gorgeous sister-in-law (Carnegie Mellon alumna 
Laura San Giacomo), and his ol’ college pal (who was 
once a compulsive liar), together with a VCR, conver­
sations, and, of course, sex. sex, lies, and videotape is 
a wonderful film that keeps you glued to the screen. 
It was a Cannes Film Festival prize winner because 
of its intrigue and exceptionally good acting. How­
ever, its deliberate pace and talky nature may not be 
for everyone, but for most folks, it’s well worth the 
dollar.
At 6, 8,10,12 — Rated R
Saturday, February 3
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
The story of a man and his close personal relation 
with a Black and Decker, you say? No. This extremely 
low-budget flick raised gore to new heights or lowered 
it to new depths, depending on your life philosophy. It 
went largely unnoticed in its first release, but has 
since become a cult classic (and inspired two sequels). 
Surpringly, it was critically acclaimed by movie buffs 
and critics alike; Consumer Reports gives the chain­
saw high marks as well. If you like blood, skin, gore, 
and logging (and who doesn’t?), see this movie. You’ll 
never view cannibalism the same way again.
At 6, 8,10,12 — Rated R
Sunday, February 4
The Return of the Pink 
Panther
The Pink Panther diamond is stolen, yet again. 
Who’s on the case? The bumbling Inspector Jacques 
Clouseau, of course. As he drives Chief Inspector 
Dreyfus to the brink of insanity, he will drive you to 
new heights of humor. Clouseau (Peter Sellers) pur­
sues the elusive phantom (Christopher Plummer) 
with many extremely funny scenes and slapstick 
aplenty. The Return of the Pink Panther is as good a 
reason as there is to return to DH 2210.
