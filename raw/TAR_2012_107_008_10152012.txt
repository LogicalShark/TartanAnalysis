Former General Counsel 
and Ambassador for the Clin-
ton administration Ira Sha-
piro delivered a lecture last 
Wednesday that compared the 
Senates of the past 30 years to 
the current Senate.
The lecture was hosted by 
Carnegie Mellon’s Center for 
International Relations and 
Politics (CIRP) and is part 
of an ongoing series of talks 
sponsored by the CIRP leading 
up to and following this year’s 
presidential election.
Kiron Skinner, director of 
the CIRP, said, “We think it’s 
important to bring in speakers 
that offer views from both per-
spectives [on political issues] 
before and after the election. 
Last week we had General 
Stanley McChrystal, and this 
week we are fortunate to have 
Mr. Shapiro.”
Shapiro, a Democrat, has 
completed numerous inter-
national trade deals while 
working in politics and gov-
ernment, most notably the 
North American Free Trade 
Agreement. He also helped 
establish the World Trade Or-
ganization. 
Shapiro, who has worked 
with the U.S. Senate and sena-
tors for the past three decades, 
began by talking about what 
he called “the last great Sen-
ate” — the Senate from the 
’60s to the ’80s.
“I was at ?rst worried that 
my nostalgia was making me 
see past Senates too favorably, 
and in?uencing my views on 
the present [Senate],” he said.
But after three years of re-
search coupled with extensive 
personal experience, Shapiro 
published his book, The Last 
Great Senate. The book details 
the ef?ciency and successful 
bipartisan efforts of previous 
Senates.
Shapiro described the Sen-
ate of this past era as one with 
a record of monumental ac-
complishments: passing civil 
rights laws, creating Great 
Society legislation, and clash-
ing with the executive branch 
over the Vietnam War and the 
Watergate scandal.
Shapiro pointed out that 
the senators of this period 
were able to achieve an ex-
traordinary amount and avoid 
the gridlock of today’s sena-
tors thanks to their willingness 
to work in a bipartisan way to-
ward the common good.
What made the “last great 
Senate” so great? Shapiro of-
fered an answer in three parts.
First, he explained that 
many of the senators between 
the ’60s and ’80s had either 
fought in World War II or had 
been affected by it in some 
large way. He described the 
generation that went through 
and emerged from the war as 
one that had great faith in the 
government and what it could 
do for the people.
Second, Shapiro said, this 
generation of senators did 
not have the vitriol and po-
larization of parties that the 
current Senate suffers from. 
He described the relationship 
among the past senators as a 
“healthy ecosystem.” 
“They would have ?erce 
debates and then go out to 
dinner as friends,” Shapiro 
said.
Finally, as a result of the 
previous two points, the “last 
great Senate” was made up of 
a group of individuals that re-
alized the Senate was a vehi-
cle for national action, and not 
a vehicle for personal interest.
“They were in parties and 
represented states, but the na-
tional interest was ?rst in their 
minds,” Shapiro said. “They 
were willing to take political 
risks, to be bipartisan, if they 
believed it was best for the 
country.”
He pointed to a series of 
events that led to the gradual 
change from the great Senate 
to the “miniaturized institu-
tion” of today. The ?rst was 
the landslide victory of Ron-
ald Reagan and Republican 
senators in 1980. “There was 
a great exodus of experienced 
senators, and there was an en-
trance of many neophyte con-
servatives,” Shapiro said.
Then, in the ’90s, things 
shifted for the worse when the 
resentment and polarization 
between the two parties in the 
House of Representatives be-
gan moving into Senate.
Since then, Shapiro said, 
it has gradually turned into 
more of a competition be-
tween two parties than an 
institution acting in the na-
tion’s interest. “In the past, 
once an election was over, 
governing started. Somehow, 
we’ve entered the ‘permanent 
campaign’ and never a time 
for governing. There’s always 
jostling for a political advan-
tage,” he said.
Shapiro said that much of 
today’s gridlock stems from 
the Republican Party. He 
pointed to the aftermath of 
the 2008 presidential election, 
when newly elected President 
Barack Obama faced the worst 
?nancial crisis since the Great 
Depression and the prospect 
of ending two wars.
“The Senate’s priority was 
to make sure Obama wasn’t

Rehana Mohammed, a 
graduate student in Heinz 
College, stood up on the Cut 
Thursday and told the campus 
the story of how she discov-
ered she was gay and came 
out on the same night. Her fa-
ther walked in on her kissing a 
friend at a sleepover.
“The next day he sent an 
ambassador, a.k.a. my mom, 
to come uncover the truth 
behind the situation. Had 
they been wrestling? Had I 
dropped the remote behind 
her and had to get it and it 
took a long time? Had my lips 
fallen on hers? Had there been 
some sort of situation that 
transpired? And this was the 
opportunity, right? This was 
the opportunity to lie. He laid 
it out for me. Tons of possible 
lies that I could just take, just 
use. But I was feeling tired. 
Didn’t get much sleep. Wink 
wink. And so, I just told the 
truth.”
Every year on National 
Coming Out Day, Carnegie 
Mellon’s ALLIES, an LGBT 
support group, hosts “Com-
ing Out at the Fence.” For this 
event, ALLIES attempts to 
paint the Fence. However, in 
the past three years that Colin 
Meret, president of ALLIES, 
has been here, the group has 
been unable to take the Fence. 
This year was the same — 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon took the 
Fence to advertise its charity 
event, Donut Dash — so AL-
LIES hosted its event next to 
the Fence.
Members set up speakers 
and a microphone and al-
lowed students, faculty, and 
staff the chance to share their 
coming out experiences with 
the Carnegie Mellon campus.
“I think it’s really helpful,” 
Meret said of National Coming 
Out Day. “I think it’s good for 
people who aren’t out to know 
that, well, there’s a whole day 
dedicated to this. Even if they 
don’t come out on that day, 
they still know that it means 
that there are people out there 
who are supporting, despite 
what might be their current 
vocal position.”
During the event, Gina Ca-
salegno, dean of student af-
fairs, shared her experience 
of her three-year-old son re-
vealing that he wanted to be 
a ballerina “with a pink skirt 
and a cool pair of tights” for 
Halloween. 
When her husband turned 
to her and asked, “Are we in 
on this together? Do we want 
to do this together?” Casaleg-
no replied, “Of course we’re 
gonna do this together. We’re 
gonna let our son be a balle-
rina.”

NOËL UM
Assistant News Editor
Journalist and author 
Brooke Gladstone, the man-
aging editor of National 
Public Radio’s On The Me-
dia, discussed the subcon-
scious in?uence that media 
have on human decision-
making processes last Mon-
day. She spoke to an audi-
ence of around 75 students 
and faculty in Giant Eagle 
Auditorium in Baker Hall.
She focused her presen-
tation on her recently pub-
lished book, The In?uencing 
Machine. The book uncov-
ers the changing relation-
ship between humans and 
new media.
While Gladstone does 
not believe that media por-
tray an accurate represen-
tation of our nation, she-
believes they run on what 
they can sell, and therefore 
generate manifestations of 
our desires.
“Media are largely a re-
?ection of who we are. Right 
now [we live in] a fractious 
and furious nation. You all 
are facing a media catastro-
phe: an apocalypse of dubi-
ous information,” she said.
According to Gladstone, 
conscious choice is an illu-
sion, and consumers sub-
consciously change the in-
formation they consume to 
?t what they believe. She 
said this problem can be 
?xed if consumers ?rst add 
their own thoughts to the 
“creative aggregation” of 
opinions in media.
Citing the Oracle of Del-
phi, Gladstone said to es-
cape from the “nauseating 
experience of constantly 
questioning our beliefs,” 
we can focus on the phrase 
“know thyself” as the foun-
dation for approaching me-
dia. “In an era when every-
thing can be asserted and 
anything denied, the re-
sponsibility falls very heav-
ily on each of us to know 
ourselves,” Gladstone said.
“We have a trusty stock 
of old opinions, and when 
someone contradicts them, 
or facts contradict them, or 
they contradict each other, 
we are thrown into tur-
moil,” she continued.
Gladstone said our re-
actions are driven more by 
impulse than by irrational-
ity. She referenced statistics 
gleaned from studies con-
ducted for her book to show 
the audience how the brain 
reacts to the mind’s stream 
of decisions.
“Everything that we 
know about cognition says 
that when faced with a con-
tradiction, we use our ratio-
nal brains to think about it, 
but that simply wasn’t the 
case,” she said.
Citing a study conduct-
ed in the ’60s on college 
student smokers and non-
smokers, Gladstone said the 
study found smokers were 
more likely to focus on in-
formation given contesting 
the relationship between 
smoking and cancer and 
the nonsmokers were more 
likely to focus on the infor-
mation given af?rming that 
link.
“There you can see very 
clearly that the ?ltering 
happens an awful lot in our 
own mind,” she said, add-
ing that it is dif?cult to ?ght

Campus farmer’s market venture proves fruitful

Ambassador laments loss of ‘last great Senate’
DEEPAK GOPALAKRISHNAN
Junior Staffwriter
CMU Garden and CulinArt, 
two organizations that focus 
on food and marketing, have 
teamed up to host a farmer’s 
market on campus.
The farmer’s market, ac-
cording to CulinArt Director 
Shelby Cole, is meant “for Cu-
linArt to extend even more ef-
forts towards sustainability on 
campus.”
Cole believes that by hold-
ing events such as the farmer’s 
market, which is located in 
Resnik Cafe, students will be 
able to spend their DineX dol-
lars on fresh groceries and 
other food staples that they 
would otherwise have to buy 
off campus.
First-year chemical engi-
neering major Ben Lam en-
joyed having more fresh pro-
duce on campus.
“My Interpretation and Ar-
gument class decided to take 
a ?eld trip to the market,” he 
said. “And I de?nitely think I’ll 
go again if they have it in the 
future.”
The wide variety of pro-
duce in the farmer’s market is 
supplied by the CMU Garden, 
a student-run organization on 
campus that owns and tends a 
garden near the Solar Decath-
lon House in Donner Ditch.
Junior biology major Molly 
Berntsen, the president of 
the CMU Garden, said that 
the purpose of the garden is 
for students to get “together 
to learn sustainable ways of 
growing food.”
Berntsen was pleased with 
the way CulinArt has worked 
with and provided aid to the 
CMU Garden.
“The CulinArt farmer’s 
markets are the perfect size for 
us,” Berntsen said. “Because 
they occur monthly, we can 
just bring as much produce 
as we have available at that 
time.”
In total, four farmer’s mar-
kets are scheduled for this 
semester. The dates are de-
termined by seasonal changes 
and harvesting times. 
The ?rst two farmer’s mar-
kets have already occurred, 
but the next two are sched-
uled for Oct. 23 and Nov. 27.

Lecture Preview
In addition to the under-
graduate courses it already 
offers, the Carnegie Mellon 
Robotics Institute is now of-
fering an additional major 
in robotics. The additional 
major is available for all stu-
dents, particularly those with 
technical majors such as com-
puter science or electrical 
and computer engineering.
Matt Mason, the direc-
tor of the Robotics Institute, 
said in a university press 
release, “The Robotics Insti-
tute always has been at the 
forefront, not only of robotic 
technology, but of the educa-
tion of roboticists.”
“We created the ?rst Ph.D. 
and master’s degree pro-
grams and the ?rst under-
graduate minor in robotics. 
Undergraduates already are 
an important part of the in-
stitute, working side by side 
with our researchers on some 
of our most exciting projects. 
Providing the option of robot-
ics as an additional major just 
seems like the natural next 
step,” he said.
The program will focus 
on robotic control systems, 
movement, machine percep-
tion, systems engineering, 
and cognition and reasoning, 
with hands-on courses on 
designing, building, and pro-
gramming robots.
It is suggested that current 
students who wish to pursue 
the additional major apply to 
the program by Feb. 1 of their 
?rst year, although it is pos-
sible for sophomores to apply 
as well.

A team of Carnegie Mel-
lon undergraduates have de-
veloped a biosensor that can 
be used to monitor cell activi-
ties.
The team developed its 
sensor for the International 
Genetically Engineered Ma-
chine (iGEM) Competition, 
which focuses on synthetic 
biology. Competing teams 
were given a toolkit of bio-
logical building blocks and 
were then asked to design 
and build a synthetic biologi-
cal system using their knowl-
edge of fundamental biology.
Carnegie Mellon’s team 
developed a biosensor using 
a ?uorogen-activating RNA 
sequence and a ?uorogen-
activating protein that glows 
brighter in response to cel-
lular activities like transcrip-
tion and translation. Then, 
using a mathematical model, 
the students were able to 
analyze the results and deter-
mine the ef?ciency of several 
promoters in bacteria.
The Carnegie Mellon team 
consists of junior chemical 
engineering and biomedical 
engineering double major 
Yang Choo; sophomore and 
senior electrical and com-
puter engineering and bio-
medical engineering majors 
Peter Wei and Jesse Salazar, 
respectively; and sophomore 
biological sciences major Eric 
Pederson. The instructors 
are Cheemeng Tan, a post-
doctoral fellow in the Ray 
and Stephanie Lane Center 
for Computational Biology, 
and Natasa Miskov-Zivanov, 
an adjunct professor in the 
department of electrical and 
computer engineering.

something that is so built into 
our brains.
Citing the implicit asso-
ciation test conducted by Har-
vard University, Gladstone ex-
plained that consumers could 
check their subconscious bi-
ases and discover the ?ltering 
that occurs constantly in their 
brains.
Gladstone believes that the 
only solution to ?x the prob-
lem of media’s in?ltration of 
our subconscious is “to bring 
the unconscious forward.”
“Our only choice is to bring 
those impulses and biases 
where we can see them,” she 
said. “Talk back to the media 
outlets that you consume, and 
produce and distribute your 
own information and com-
mentary when you know it’s 
good.”
Students who attended 
Gladstone’s lecture said they 
got a lot out of it.
Elizabeth Lee, a master’s 
student in English, said, “I 
think that media can [start 
to affect us] if we don’t think 
critically about what it’s tell-
ing us every day. I think if we 
just absorb it, then it would be 
dangerous. Talks like [Glad-
stone’s] are good because it is 
good to be aware of keeping 
your ?lters on.”
Some students, however, 
disagreed with aspects of the 
talk. Kurt Sampsel, a Ph.D. 
student in English, said that 
he disagreed with Gladstone’s 
assertion that media is a re-
?ection of what we desire. 
“I think it’s an interesting 
model of understanding or 
critiquing media to start with 
how it does things that we 
like, but it also ends up doing 
things that we don’t like. For 
instance, advertising ends up 
selling a lot of products that 
I’m not interested in, so it 
doesn’t necessarily mirror my 
interests,” he said.
Gladstone’s lecture was 
sponsored by the Humanities 
Center for its lecture series on 
media and social change, as 
well as by the Center for Arts 
in Society.
Kathleen Newman, an as-
sociate professor of English, 
was responsible for bringing 
Gladstone to campus. 
“I think of Brooke Glad-
stone as somebody who tries 
to take a pretty fair look at 
media and social change,” 
Newman said. “She is some-
times dubious about the pow-
er of media to make a positive 
change, so I thought she was 
an interesting person to play 
both sides of the argument.”
Gladstone has received 
two Peabody Awards, which 
are awarded yearly in recog-
nition of distinguished public 
service by radio and television 
stations.
reelected. That shouldn’t have 
been their priority. Their pri-
ority should have been the na-
tional interest,” Shapiro said.
“If you look back at what 
happened, the Senate Repub-
licans didn’t allow the stimu-
lus to be big enough.... They 
tried to block the healthcare 
bill even though it contained 
ideas from both parties.... We 
got close to the brink of de-
fault in 2011. In the past, [the 
debt ceiling] would have got-
ten raised automatically,” he 
said.
Even so, Shapiro has some 
optimism for change.
“The hope that I see comes 
from the senators themselves. 
They are as frustrated with 
the hyper-partisan system as 
the public is. There is a chance 
for change now, but they must 
decide themselves to go back 
to being senators,” he said.
Those who attended the 
lecture responded positively 
to Shapiro’s talk, saying that 
his explanation of what made 
past Senates so effective was 
clear and insightful.
“What he said made 
sense,” said sophomore inter-
national relations and politics 
major Razghiem Golden. “A 
lot of times, politicians worry 
about staying in of?ce more 
than getting stuff done. The 
change needs to start from 
the top down.”
“I’m Republican, but I think 
Obama is the best choice for 
the next election. He has the 
chance to do something more 
radical [if elected] because he 
doesn’t have to worry about 
running for another term,” 
Golden continued.
As Shapiro closed his talk, 
he reminded the audience 
both of the past Senates’ tri-
umphs, and of the problems 
that face the current and next 
Senates. 
“The next Senate elected

Lenore Blum, a computer 
science professor at Carnegie 
Mellon, recently presented a 
School of Computer Science 
Special Talk Lecture. The lec-
ture, which took place Tues-
day in Rashid Auditorium, 
was titled “Alan Turing and 
the Other Theory of Compu-
tation.” Alan Turing is a fa-
mous ?gure in computer sci-
ence, and is well known for 
inventing the Turing machine 
and for his work with the the-
ory of computation.
The lecture was an encore 
performance of one Blum de-
livered earlier this year to cel-
ebrate Turing’s 100th birth-
day.
Turing is known for his 
role in the development of 
the theory of computation, 
but Blum’s lecture focused 
on his work in what she calls 
the “other theory of compu-
tation,” based on “numeri-
cal analysis and continuous 
mathematics” in scienti?c 
computing, rather than “logic 
and discrete mathematics in 
computer science.”
She noted the differences 
between the two areas. Com-
puter science uses “0s and 
1s,” discrete mathematics, 
and the Turing machine; it 
solves problems exactly and is 
a function of input word size. 
Meanwhile, scienti?c com-
puting employs real and com-
plex numbers and uses alge-
braic analysis and continuous 
mathematics; it “solves prob-
lems to a certain accuracy” 
and is a function of “intrinsic 
word size.”
“They really are two cul-
tures,” Blum said.
First, Blum spoke about 
“where Turing meets Newton 
and bridges the two tradi-
tions” of computer science. 
Blum described how, in 
1936, Turing demonstrated 
his interaction with real num-
bers in his ?rst paper. He 
“used real numbers as a moti-
vation to de?ne his machine.” 
Additionally, in a paper 
written afterwards, Turing re-
turned to computing with real 
numbers. 
Blum said Turing’s experi-
ence was positive, as it was 
“fashionable to talk about 
computing as a lens on the 
sciences.”
First-year English major 
Andy Hutner had a positive 
opinion of the lecture. “Well, 
I’m actually familiar with Alan 
Turing, even though I’m not 
in the mathematical ?eld, be-
cause his theories on discrete 
mathematics play a big part 
in the study of linguistics,” 
he said. “I think Blum did a 
great job of showing Turing’s 
contributions to mathematics 
in a different way than most 
people would think of.”
Blum has been on Carn-
egie Mellon’s faculty since 
1999. She has dedicated a 
large portion of her career to 
the advancement of women 
in mathematics and science. 
Blum is a founder of Wom-
en@SCS, as well as the found-
ing director of Project Olym-
pus, which supports Carnegie 
Mellon-based tech start-ups.
her children about various 
families and how, no matter 
how different each family is 
or how far apart they are, the 
family is still a family and still 
cares about each other.
“We’re on the verge of 
such potential change, and we 
have seen it coming slowly in 
my lifetime, and when I think 
of my kids and their future, I 
am very hopeful,” Casalegno 
said.
When stories weren’t be-
ing shared, ALLIES played 
recordings such as “25 Celeb-
rity Coming Out Stories That 
Shocked The World” by The 
Huf?ngton Post.
“It’s in your face in a good 
way,” Vivek Nair, sophomore 
electrical and computer en-
gineering major, said of the 
event. “It’s actually effective 
at those half-hour marks, 
where a cluster of people wait 
to read. It gets the message 
across without being a pa-
rade. It tells a story, instead of 
spectacle.”
Meg Evans, housefellow 
for Stever House and coor-
dinator of LGBTQ resources, 
said that ALLIES’s main goal 
is “a cross between advocacy, 
awareness, activism and com-
munity.” 
Evans also said that the 
number one way that LGBTs 
support people coming out is 
by “just having a community 
of people that is safe and is 
going to fully accept them for 
them.”
October is LGBT History 
Month. According to Evans, 
ALLIES has multiple events 
going on this month to pro-
mote awareness.
“Something about being 
gay that a lot of people think 
is awful is that you have to 
come out to everyone you 
meet. You know, you’re not 
just [gay] like straight people 
are just straight. And you’re 
straight until proven gay. And 
that does kinda suck, but I like 
to see it as an opportunity to 
come out in different ways 
every time,” Mohammed 
said. “I encourage people to 
think of coming out not only 
as this awful thing they build 
up to — which the ?rst time it 
is — but the continual coming 
out.... Make it fun. Why not?”
Future bright, says ALLIES

Two big data research 
projects here at Carnegie Mel-
lon received a combined total 
of over $1.7 million from the 
National Science Foundation 
(NSF) and the National In-
stitutes of Health (NIH) last 
week.
Aarti Singh and Christos 
Faloutsos, the principal inves-
tigators of the two big data 
projects at Carnegie Mellon, 
received these grants as a 
result of the NSF-NIH 2012 
Big Data Research and De-
velopment Initiative Launch. 
Grants, totaling $15 million, 
were awarded to eight big 
data projects throughout the 
country that focus on unique 
aspects of the problems pres-
ent in big data.
But what is big data, and 
why is it important?
As society and technolo-
gy’s relationship matures and 
becomes increasingly com-
plex, scientists and engineers 
?nd themselves faced with 
a rapidly growing phenom-
enon: big data. As it implies, 
the phrase describes any data 
set that is very, very large. But 
as Suzi Iacono, senior science 
adviser at the NSF, described 
in the grants’ press release, 
“Big data is characterized not 
only by the enormous volume 
or the velocity of its genera-
tion, but also by the heteroge-
neity, diversity, and complex-
ity of the data.”
That is to say, all of our 
twitter posts, satellite data, 
purchases, and medical re-
cords generate a lot of data: 
2.5 quintillion — that’s a 1 
followed by 18 zeros — bytes 
of data a day. There is a cur-
rent need for innovative ways 
to process it all.
One aspect of big data that 
makes it so complex is its high 
dimensional nature. In a 2D 
system, x causes y and the 
relationship can be described 
by a function. But when more 
variables are added to the sys-
tem, there are not only more 
data and data types that the 
variables represent, but the 
relationship that describes 
the data set is also harder to 
determine.
One way to sort through 
this data is by data mining, a 
technique that combines com-
puter science and statistics. 
Both Singh’s and Faloutsos’ 
research focus on improving 
current data mining methods 
and applications.
Singh, an assistant profes-
sor in machine learning, re-
ceived $820,000. She works 
with Timothy Verstynen, an 
assistant professor of psychol-
ogy, and Barnabás Póczos, 
a postdoctoral fellow in ma-
chine learning. Together, they 
are the principal investigators 
for research that runs out of 
the Auton Lab, part of Carne-
gie Mellon’s computer science 
department.
According to its website, 
the lab wants to study “how 
to ef?ciently estimate cer-
tain important functionals of 
high-dimensional distribu-
tions ... and use these esti-
mators in machine learning 
algorithms.” By doing so, the 
researchers can further the 
high-dimensional challenge 
of mapping the brain’s billions 
and trillions of neurons and 
neural networks. If their re-
search is successful, not only 
can it be applied to just neu-
roimaging data analysis, but 
also to “other scienti?c ?elds 
where collective behavior of a 
population is important.”
Faloutsos’ research focuses 
on the big data associated 
with language processing. 
Faloutsos teaches in the ma-
chine learning department 
and works with Tom Mitchell, 
also in the department, and 
Nikolaos Sidiropoulos of the 
University of Minnesota. They 
work on graph mining groups 
of words, or “strings,” in a ma-
trix to better understand lan-
guage processing.
Their data contains mil-
lions of triplets that house 
three strings with a subject-
verb-object relationship, such 
as the relationship between 
the strings “Obama,” “is the 
President,” and “of the Unit-
ed States of America.” With 
enough similar data, Falout-
sos explained, the computer 
can extrapolate from “David 
Cameron,” “prime minister,” 
and “U.K.” that Cameron is 
probably a politician. And 
when it’s extended to “Ben Ro-
ethlisberger,” “quarterback,” 
and “Steelers,” the computer 
automatically builds another 
layer and groups Roethlis-
berger with other people of 
leadership. Mitchell calls this 
research project the Never 
Ending Language Learner 
(NELL).
Related to NELL and in-
cluded in the NSF grant is a 
project in neurolinguistics 
that attempts to understand 
how human brains process 
language. The researchers 
use a functional MRI to view 
how the brain responds to a 
word, then try to predict how 
the brain will process other 
words, studying how those 
words relate to one another. 
The data associated with this 
research “will force us to de-
velop new algorithms or to 
rethink algorithms and new 
theories that help us analyze 
new data sets that were al-
most impossible to analyze 
before,” Faloutsos said.
Researchers awarded funds to work on big data
Nobel Prize goes to two American chemists
Scientists Robert Lefkow-
itz and Brian Kobilka received 
the Nobel Prize in chemis-
try for interpreting how the 
human body senses and re-
sponds to signals from the 
outside world. Their discov-
ery, including the detection of 
receptor molecules between 
adrenaline and cells, has 
provided an intricate under-
standing of the human body 
and has aided greatly in drug 
development. 
According to Sven Lidin 
of the Royal Swedish Acad-
emy, the receptors discovered 
by Lefkowitz and Kobilka 
“are the target of half of all 
drugs.” Lefkowitz, a medical 
professor at Duke University 
and a Howard Hughes Medi-
cal Institute researcher, and 
Kobilka, a medical professor 
at Stanford University, will 
share the $1.2 million.

Researchers explore black hole energy blasts
A team of astrophysicists 
may have unlocked the mys-
tery of what makes black 
holes spew energy back out. 
Black holes have a gravita-
tional pull so strong that they 
will consume anything near 
them, and they have been ob-
served to spew out energy jets 
from previously-consumed 
matter.
Astrophysicists at the Hay-
stack Observatory and the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology used radio tele-
scopes to observe a jet spew-
ing from a black hole in a 
galaxy about 54 million light- 
years away. The energy jet 
came from near the innermost 
edge of the accretion disk, the 
last point at which the matter 
can move in a constant orbit. 
The team has speculated that 
the blasts occur because mag-
netic ?elds within the orbiting 
material in the hole become 
twisted and carry energy 
away through an electromag-
netic blast.

Massive galaxies often collide with each other
Astronomers at the Uni-
versity of Utah found evi-
dence of repeated collisions 
between massive galaxies. 
The galaxies, which contain 
close to a trillion stars, are 
the end result of the merg-
ing of many smaller galaxies. 
Astronomers have observed 
that they have become dens-
er at the center over time, 
which can only occur when 
two galaxies of similar size 
collide.
“If you have two roughly 
comparable galaxies and 
they are on a collision course, 
each one penetrates more to-
ward the center of the other, 
so more mass ends up in the 
center,” explained Adam 
Bolton, the principal author 
of the study. The study is a 
joint effort between the Uni-
versity of Utah, The Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey, and 20 
other research institutes 
worldwide.

New iPhone app able to monitor ear infections
Researchers at Georgia 
Tech and Emory University 
have developed the “Remo-
toscope.” It makes the iPhone 
function as an otoscope, the 
instrument doctors use to 
check their patients’ ears. The 
idea behind the app is to en-
able parents to regularly take 
pictures of their child’s ear 
and send the images to pedia-
tricians so they can supervise 
infections. 
It functions by putting a 
scope over the phone’s cam-
era lens, facilitating capturing 
images of the ear canal, and 
magnifying the images. The 
app is currently undergoing 
clinical trials, with the hope 
that the results may be pub-
lished by the end of the year.

Eyeball of unknown species found on Florida shore 
While walking on Pom-
pano Beach, Fla., Gino Co-
vacci stumbled across what 
he claimed was “the biggest 
eyeball he had ever seen.” Ac-
cording to Covacci, the eye-
ball seemed to have recently 
been separated from the crea-
ture it belonged to, as it was 
bleeding when discovered.
He turned the eyeball over 
to the Florida Fish and Wild-
life Conservation Commis-
sion, which has preserved it 
in formaldehyde to observe it 
further. So far, the most likely 
source of the eyeball seems 
to be a large ?sh, such as a 
sword?sh. However, there is 
not yet certainty as to what 
creature it belonged to.

Jeremy Zerechak, an 
award-winning ?lmmaker 
from Pittsburgh, stopped by 
Carnegie Mellon CyLab last 
Friday to talk about his new 
documentary Code 2600. As 
part of a panel discussion led 
by Lorrie Cranor, associate 
professor of computer science 
and engineering and public 
policy, Zerechak talked about 
the major themes of the ?lm, 
which mostly revolve around 
hacking, cybersecurity, and 
privacy. Two screenings of 
Code 2600, also sponsored by 
CyLab, were shown at McCo-
nomy Auditorium later that 
day.
After garnering success 
with his critically acclaimed 
2008 war documentary Land 
of Confusion, Zerechak ex-
plained how a later encounter 
with an intrusion detection 
specialist sparked his interest 
about hacking and cybersecu-
rity.
“I decided to go ahead and 
do extensive research into that 
story,” Zerechak said. “What I 
found was a history that was 
rich and untold, and a story of 
an expansive world that I felt 
was very underrepresented.”
Zerechak’s documentary 
begins by touching on the 
“phone phreaks” of the ’60s 
and ’70s, who would employ 
various techniques to lever-
age the telecommunications 
systems in place at the time. 
Among the most popular of 
these techniques was one 
that involved using a hobby-
ist contraption called a blue 
box to make free long-distance 
phone calls.
A phone phreak would 
place the blue box next to the 
mouthpiece of a telephone 
and dial a long-distance tele-
phone number on the blue 
box’s keypad. The blue box 
would then generate corre-
sponding 2600 Hertz tones — 
hence the ?lm’s name — and 
trick the long-distance dialing 
systems into routing the call. 
With a 10-minute phone call 
from San Francisco to New 
York costing the equivalent of 
$55 today, these widespread 
“phreaking” techniques cost 
telecommunications compa-
nies fortunes at the time.
As this was one of the ear-
liest struggles between tech 
corporations and hackers, 
panel member Nicolas Chris-
tin, associate director of the 
Information Networking Insti-
tute and CyLab senior systems 
scientist, drew some compari-
sons between that scenario 
and the piracy issues plaguing 
the digital entertainment in-
dustry today.
“In the ’60s, phone calls 
were expensive and people 
didn’t want to spend money, 
[so] they developed early in-
genious technology to circum-
vent that,” he said. “Now if 
you fast-forward to, say, today, 
movies, movie rentals are very 
expensive, and people don’t 
want to spend that money.... 
The root of the problem is still 
the same today. The technolo-
gy has changed, but ultimately 
it’s about economics.”
The ?lm also described 
many current cybersecurity is-
sues. It featured a few “white 
hats” — hackers who exploit 
systems for benign purposes, 
such as revealing security 
?aws to a company — explain-
ing various methods they’ve 
used to obtain con?dential in-
formation.
Some were able to extract 
account passwords, credit 
card numbers, social secu-
rity numbers, and other types 
of sensitive data by crack-
ing poor wireless encryption 
schemes or by inconspicuously 
acquiring such data at public 
wireless access points. Oth-
ers tricked unsuspecting users 
into plugging ?ash drives full 
of hidden, harmful programs 
into their computers.
Jeff Moss, founder of the 
hacking conferences Black 
Hat and DEFCON, demon-
strated a terminal program 
called Metasploit that he was 
able to use to gain access to 
the core system ?les on a Win-
dows machine. The punch line 
this time? He was doing it all 
wirelessly from his jailbroken 
iPhone. 
Obviously, tools like these 
falling into the hands of “black 
hats” — those who exploit sys-
tems for malicious purposes 
— make them powerful oppo-
nents to the ?nancial security 
of the typically unprepared 
consumer engaging in online 
transactions.
“Cyber crime is really tak-
ing over,” said panel member 
Norman Sadeh, professor of 
computer science at Carnegie 
Mellon. “From people iden-
tifying exploits, to people 
enabling these exploits, to 
people controlling botnets 
and making these botnets 
available, there’s an entire 
black economy that has devel-
oped.... It has made it easier 
for people to launch attacks on 
a much larger scale than what 
was previously possible.”
Yet another dimension that 
Code 2600 ambitiously tries 
to address is the question, 
“Is privacy dead?” In an age 
where people seem willing to 
publicize more of their private 
information to social networks 
like Twitter and Facebook to 
promote their social status, 
some like world-class cryp-
tographer and security com-
mentator Bruce Schneier are 
questioning whether this re-
ally is the best course of action 
for our society.
“There’s a common myth 
that privacy is about some-
thing to hide,” Schneier says 
in the documentary. “ ‘I don’t 
have anything to hide, so I 
don’t need privacy.’ But you 
know that’s not true. You don’t 
have any[thing] to hide when 
you sing in the shower or write 
a love letter and then tear it 
up. Privacy is about us as in-
dividuals; it’s about our ability 
to be who we are, without nec-
essarily telling everybody.... 
It’s not about hiding, it’s about 
personal dignity.”
“When you use a bookseller 
like Amazon.com,” adds Jen-
nifer Granick, director of civil 
liberties at Stanford Univer-
sity, in the ?lm, “they’re keep-
ing information about not only 
books you buy and where your 
house is that they have to ship 
the books to, but about what 
books you brag [about]. All of 
that information gets collected 
and stored.... This is some of 
the most private kinds of in-
formation: what books you’re 
interested in [and] what you 
search on Google.... Think 
about how you would feel 
if someone could get access 
to what you were searching 
for. It’s basically what you’re 
thinking ... some of the most 
intimate, personal informa-
tion that’s out there.”

BROOKE KUEI

In recent decades, signi?-
cant advances in particle phys-
ics have been made through 
experiments conducted by 
particle accelerators. While 
the most well-known and 
talked about accelerator is the 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), 
there are many other accelera-
tors around the world, includ-
ing the Beijing Electron-Posi-
tron Collider (BEPC) and the 
Thomas Jefferson National Ac-
celerator Facility in Virginia — 
all of which Carnegie Mellon 
professors have worked with. 
The LHC is a gigantic par-
ticle accelerator that lies 100 
meters underground between 
the borders of Switzerland 
and France. It accelerates pro-
tons or lead ions inside its cir-
cular track, which then collide 
head-on at high energy levels. 
The particles created by these 
collisions are then analyzed in 
detectors.
“Carnegie Mellon has been 
involved in the design and 
construction of the CMS,” 
said physics professor Helmut 
Vogel, one of several fac-
ulty members working with 
the LHC, in reference to the 
Compact Muon Solenoid de-
tector. “We also helped write 
the software and build part of 
the hardware. We are now in-
volved in data analysis.”
One of the main goals of 
the LHC is to detect the elusive 
Higgs boson, a particle theo-
rized to give other particles 
mass. However, many of the 
particles that the LHC seeks to 
discover, including the Higgs, 
have lifespans that are much 
too short to leave tracks in the 
detectors. Instead, scientists 
use simulations to predict the 
decay products of such par-
ticles, and look for these in the 
detectors.
“We have found something 
that in some ways behaves like 
the predictions for the Higgs, 
although we don’t have the 
amount of data yet to tell with 
high precision,” Vogel said. 
Further research supporting 
this newly discovered Higgs-
like particle would prove that 
the current model of how the 
world works is correct. 
Meanwhile, a different type 
of particle physics experiment 
is going on at the BEPC in Chi-
na. While the work being done 
at the LHC is referred to as the 
“energy frontier,” the BEPC 
focuses more on the “intensity 
frontier.” Instead of searching 
for the existence of undetected 
particles, precision measure-
ments of particular known 
particles are studied to test 
how well their behavior agrees 
with theoretical models.
“Electron-positron col-
lisions are used to produce 
various bound states of charm 
quarks,” wrote Carnegie Mel-
lon physics professor Roy Bri-
ere, who collaborates with the 
BEPC, in his research state-
ment. Data from this collider 
will answer important ques-
tions, such as the dominance 
of matter over antimatter in 
the universe. 
In Virginia, the Jefferson 
Lab is probing the behavior 
of quarks. Michael Darcy, a 
junior physics major who in-
terned with the lab over the 
summer, described the Con-
tinuous Electron Beam Accel-
erator Facility, the lab’s parti-
cle accelerator: “It accelerates 
electrons with superconduct-
ing radio-frequency cavities 
around a racetrack-shaped 
tunnel.”
“Jefferson Labs currently 
has three running experi-
mental stations called Hall 
A, B, and C,” he said, describ-
ing the lab. “Electrons from 
the beamline can be split into 
these three different rooms 
and each room has a differ-
ent kind of particle detector 
in it.” A fourth hall is currently 
under construction and will 
be used to perform the GlueX 
experiment, for which phys-
ics professor Curtis Meyer 
is the spokesperson. GlueX 
aims to discover exotic me-
sons — a postulated but yet-
undiscovered type of meson 
made of two quarks and two 
anti-quarks. 
So why is it important to 
spend time and money on 
these immense projects? Vogel 
gave two reasons.
The ?rst is cultural: “What 
is the bene?t of knowing the 
Earth revolves around the 
sun and not the other way 
around? It is knowledge that 
contributes to the culture of 
society. Even if it has no direct 
impact on building a better mi-
crowave, or better cars.... It is 
valuable knowledge.” 
His second reason is more 
practical for those seeking a 
career: “Particle accelerators 
are immensely complicated 
apparatuses that take people 
with very sophisticated skills 
to build. These experiments 
are training a new generation 
of people with enormous skills 
that are very marketable, and 
very sought after, in many 
?elds.”
CMU physicists explore the foundations of the universe
MICHAEL SETZER
Acting SciTech Editor   
 “Science is best learned 
when presented in story form.”
Such is Sam Kean’s point of 
view on the explanation of sci-
enti?c knowledge. The science 
writer gave a lecture, titled 
“The Disappearing Spoon,” to 
a crowd of about 100 in Gregg 
Hall last Thursday.
Kean, an author of two na-
tional best-selling books, The 
Disappearing Spoon and The 
Violinist’s Thumb, focused his 
talk on the little-known back-
stories of some of the elements 
on the periodic table. He be-
gan the lecture by tying his 
early interest in science to his 
mother’s mercury thermome-
ter. Calling mercury the “most 
fascinating substance I’ve ever 
seen,” Kean explained how 
his curiosity while watching 
his mother clean up a broken 
thermometer turned into a 
full-?edged obsession with 
chemistry and the people be-
hind the discoveries.
He delved into the story of 
Dr. Benjamin Rush, a physi-
cian who created tablets full of 
mercury as a way (he thought) 
to cure illness. Kean explained 
that the doctor gave Lewis and 
Clark over 600 of these tab-
lets — known for their intense 
laxative effect — and that re-
searchers can even determine 
some locations the explorers 
visited due to the high levels 
of mercury in the soil.
For Kean, these obscure 
tidbits of information are the 
most interesting ways to learn 
about science. He even noted 
that aluminum had the “clas-
sic narrative of a story,” fol-
lowing the element’s history 
from obscure beginnings as 
an unusable metal, its rising 
action to acclaim among roy-
alty, its climax at the peak of 
manufacturing, and its even-
tual crash to relative worth-
lessness.
Kean read two excerpts 
from The Disappearing Spoon, 
one focusing on the political 
tensions surrounding the ele-
ment molybdenum and the 
other on the work of scientist 
George de Hevesy. Kean said 
that he wanted his book to not 
only talk about the history of 
the elements, but to also talk 
about “some of the scientists 
with really big personalities.”
Kean utilized his story-tell-
ing skills throughout the lec-
ture to interweave well-known 
historical events with the nar-
ratives of scientists such as 
Hevesy and James Seaborg. 
He gave an account of how 
Hevesy deceived Nazi soldiers 
looking for a colleague’s il-
legally exported Nobel Prize 
by melting the gold medal 
into an unassuming ?ask; the 
Germans never found it and 
the Nobel committee recast it 
afterward.
The students, professors, 
and other members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
in attendance were receptive 
to Kean’s humor and captivat-
ing presentation. 
For some, his lecture spoke 
of the importance of effective 
and interesting communica-
tion of science.
“As a society we certainly 
would bene?t from a more 
scienti?cally-educated and 
engaged citizenry, and books 
like this are a terri?c mecha-
nism towards that end,” Karen 
Stump, director of the depart-
ment of chemistry’s under-
graduate Studies and labora-
tories, said via email.
Kean’s “science history 
romp” exposes the faces be-
hind the periodic table, which 
he calls “the most precious 
real estate in all of science.” 
It’s these stories, people, and 
ideas that make science so fas-
cinating to him.
“We all know about the sci-
ence of the periodic table... it’s 
fundamental. But the periodic 
table means more to that; it’s 
a story book, it’s a trove, with 
our passions stored within it,” 
he said.

Every American citizen should be 
generally aware of the happenings 
in the Supreme Court; the rulings it 
makes affect our entire nation, after 
all. But one of the court’s most recent 
cases could have a monumental im-
pact on Carnegie Mellon and its stu-
dent body.
The case, Fisher v. University of 
Texas, concerns the use of af?rmative 
action in admissions at the University 
of Texas at Austin. 
Abigail Fisher and Rachel 
Maichaelwicz, both white women, 
applied to UT Austin in 2008. When 
they were both denied admission, 
they ?led suit, arguing that racial 
discrimination was at play. The case 
has made its way up the ladder of our 
district court system since 2009, and 
in both the lower court cases, the uni-
versity’s af?rmative action policy was 
upheld.
The Supreme Court, however, is 
split on this issue. With Justice Elena 
Kagan, who was involved as Solicitar 
General, sitting out this case, Justice 
Anthony Kennedy probably stands as 
the decisive vote.
If, through this case, the Supreme 
Court rules to revise or entirely scrap 
2003’s Grutter v. Bollinger, which al-
lowed colleges to use race in their ad-
missions processes, Carnegie Mellon 
will have to rethink its admissions 
and scholarship processes.
According to a Carnegie Mellon 
research study conducted in 2009, 
minority enrollment in top-tier 
schools could decrease by 35 per-
cent if af?rmative action were to be 
banned. 
Carnegie Mellon, known for engi-
neering a diverse campus, would be 
drastically affected.
In a 2003 memo from Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared Cohon, he 
made very clear that the university 
is “committed to equal opportunity 
for all, and to af?rmative action.” A 
signi?cant part of Carnegie Mellon’s 
culture and values stem from the 
idea that diversity stimulates intel-
lectual and personal growth, that 
surrounding students and faculty 
members with people unlike them 
not only “makes them better” — as 
stated in the memo — but also makes 
Carnegie Mellon a way station for 
almost every valid opinion and per-
spective.
We at The Tartan advise all Carn-
egie Mellon students to pay particu-
lar attention to the Fisher v. University 
of Texas case, so they can be well-in-
formed about what could be an im-
mense change to campus life and uni-
versity policy.

Petting zoo provides healthy dose of relaxation, nostalgia on campus 
Although college is supposed to 
be the transition from childhood to 
adulthood, the nostalgia that comes 
from reliving childhood pastimes can 
relieve stress and raise spirits. How-
ever, that transition to adulthood is 
often fast and jarring. It will be hard 
to escape the mundane activities and 
repetitiveness of adult life, and all of 
us will surely yearn for our youth at 
some point during our adulthood.
Luckily, we’re in college, and we 
still have full reign to bask in the nos-
talgia of simpler times. Therefore, we 
commend AB Special Events for help-
ing us make the most of this time by 
hosting a petting zoo Tuesday on the 
College of Fine Arts lawn.
AB Special Events “exists to pro-
vide the campus community with 
various novelty events throughout 
the year,” according to its website. 
While no other upcoming events are 
currently listed, we hope the organi-
zation continues to provide fun and 
unexpected activities in the future, 
especially events similar to the im-
promptu petting zoo.
While such things may seem im-
mature to some, the student body 
revels in the euphoria that ?uffy ani-
mals can bring to campus. Harken-
ing back to our childhoods — be it 
through proximity to farm animals, 
obscure references to childhood TV 
shows, or playing with Nerf guns — 
is an excellent way to deal with the 
stress of academia and our imminent 
dive into maturity.
The largest event of the year for 
Carnegie Mellon, Spring Carnival, 
is entirely devoted to this concept. 
Funnel cakes, carnival rides, and fun 
houses not only ?ll our time during 
the festivities: They bring us back to 
a mindset when we were less cynical 
and everything was magical. 
Petting a goat on campus on a 
Tuesday afternoon may seem trivial, 
but it’s the little things that matter. 
It’s those special moments in the day 
when we can forget about midterms, 
deadlines, that roommate of yours 
who doesn’t empty the sink, and re-
lax, if ever so brie?y. 
We applaud AB Special Events for 
making this feeling accessible to the 
student body, as a petting zoo does as 
much for the soul as a life lesson from 
Mr. Feeny.

Pokémon played a prominent role 
in our generation’s childhood. From 
the video games to the trading cards 
to the television show, Pokémon is a 
fun and exciting franchise, remem-
bered fondly by almost all who grew 
up with it.
However, the release of the new-
est Pokémon video game has brought 
on some substantial criticism from 
animal rights group People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals, better 
known as PETA.
PETA, well known for its outland-
ish publicity stunts to draw attention 
to their causes, has started protesting 
the Pokémon franchise as promoting 
animal abuse.
In opposition to the new game, 
PETA released an online parody titled 
Pokémon Black & Blue: Gotta Free ’em 
All. The game and its artwork feature 
a bandaged, bloodied Pikachu that 
escaped to ?ght for freedom against 
its former, bloodstained masters.
Pikachu can ?ght back using stan-
dard attacks such as “Thundershock” 
and “Quick Attack,” but can also 
“Protest” or try to engage in a “Group 
Hug.”
On top of that, once you success-
fully beat your trainer, your reward is 
the ability to watch videos of animal 
cruelty.
The choice to protest Pokémon, 
out of all the possible causes to 
choose from, seems absurd. 
PETA’s decision to attack a game 
series that has passed its peak, one 
whose anime and related products 
emphasize values like friendship and 
companionship, seems inexplicable.
Below the parody game, PETA 
wrote, “The amount of time that 
Pokémon spend stuffed in pokéballs 
is akin to how elephants are chained 
up in train carts, waiting to be let out 
to ‘perform’ in circuses.” It added, “If 
PETA existed in Unova, our motto 
would be: Pokémon are not ours to 
use or abuse. They exist for their own 
reasons. We believe that this is the 
message that should be sent to chil-
dren.”
It is worth noting that, despite 
their role as ?ghting pets in the vid-
eogames, the Pokémon cartoons and 
movies have always emphasized 
that Pokémon should be treated hu-
manely and with respect as friends. 
Nintendo also went to lengths to em-
phasize that Pokémon only “faint” 
after their battles, and do not die as 
a result of ?ghting in battles during 
the game.
This isn’t the ?rst time PETA has 
distorted popular games for its cause, 
having released a Mario parody in 
the past and Super Tofu Boy in re-
sponse to the popular indie game Su-
per Meat Boy.
Despite the absurdity of this pro-
test, the game has been successful at 
one thing: gaining attention. 
What better way to get your 
name in the news than by attacking 
people’s fond childhood memories? 
PETA has always been an organiza-
tion concerned about gaining pub-
licity, and doesn’t care if it’s good or 
bad.
If PETA wants to raise awareness 
for animal rights, that is its own pre-
rogative. 
However, attacking our childhood 
memories and a perfectly innocent 
game franchise is not the best way to 
do this.
Plan B in schools sends bad message
AUBREY MORAIF

New York City mayor Michael 
Bloomberg and the city’s Depart-
ment of Education implemented 
the program Connecting Adoles-
cents To Comprehensive Health-
care (CATCH) last year to prevent 
teenage pregnancy in students of 
city schools.
This pilot program for sexual 
education and contraceptives has 
been in place for almost two years, 
but it recently gained the spotlight 
for its expansion from ?ve to 13 
schools, and for teens’ increased 
access to the morning-after pill, 
also known as Plan B.
New York City’s plan to reduce 
teen pregnancy by increasing sex-
ual education and availability of 
various contraceptives is a step in 
the right direction. The U.S. has 
one of the highest teen pregnancy 
rates when compared to equally 
developed countries. 
But allowing Plan B to be easily 
accessible will perpetuate the idea 
that unprotected sex is okay.
Plan B is not a substitute for 
traditional contraception, such as 
condoms or the pill; it is supposed 
to be true to its name: A “plan B” 
for if your plan A fails. Making Plan 
B so accessible will make it too 
easy for teens to count on Plan B in 
a way they shouldn’t.
An increase in unprotected sex 
will result in an increase in preg-
nancies, because while Plan B is 
effective, it is not as effective as 
traditional contraceptives. Unpro-
tected sex also results in a higher 
chance of contracting STIs. 
If Plan B is to be available, stu-
dents should learn its risks and 
dangers of overuse. However, Plan 
B is better than no plan at all, so 
schools should have information 
for students on how to access it, 
especially for victims of sexual 
assault.
Those behind CATCH also 
hoped that the plan would result 
in an increase in communication 
between parents and their teens 
about sex. 
But making contraception 
available at student health centers 
means that teens don’t need to 
communicate with their parents at 
all — they just need to speak to the 
school nurse. In this way, schools 
are going over the parents’ heads. 
While the schools asked par-
ents for their consent, some 
didn’t feel comfortable or sure of 
their opinions; these and other 
parents simply didn’t answer. 
Many never received any kind of 
noti?cation about the program.
There are parts of New York 
City’s plan that do make sense, 
though. Condoms should be avail-
able to students, as should sexual 
education.
Sex is a part of life for many 
teens; pregnancy shouldn’t be. 
And since teens are inevitably go-
ing to be making choices about 
sex, they should be educated on 
the potential consequences of their 
actions and how to take precau-
tions to avoid them. 
Plan B is an effective form of 
birth control as a second or third 
option, but should remain behind 
the counter in a pharmacy, not 
with the school nurse.

No way President cooked job numbersLeave science to those who actually believe it
Propagating sexism has consequences
LUKE MASA

Speaking at a recent dinner event 
at a Baptist Church in Georgia, Con-
gressman Paul Broun (R.-Ga.) de-
clared, “All that stuff I was taught 
about — evolution, embryology, Big 
Bang theory — all that is lies straight 
from the pit of hell. It’s lies to try to 
keep me and all the folks who are 
taught that from understanding that 
they need a savior.” Unfortunately, 
this statement might not be surpris-
ing to those attuned to American po-
litical discourse.
What did surprise me is that 
Broun is on the U.S. House Science, 
Space, and Technology Commit-
tee, whose jurisdiction includes en-
ergy policy, research, and science 
education. 
Yes, someone who legislates pol-
icy related to educating youth about 
proper science would presumably 
be unable to pass a grade school 
class that taught it. Marking “It’s a 
lie from hell” on a bio test would be 
a sure?re way to fail. Our country, 
which has led the world in science 
research in countless ?elds for years, 
appears to be run by those who, be-
cause of their fundamentalist views, 
lack a fundamental understanding 
of reality.
What’s even more shocking is 
that not only is Broun a medical doc-
tor, but he also holds a B.S. in chem-
istry from the University of Georgia. 
It would now appear that he holds 
science as B.S.
Further complicating matters is 
the fact that none other than U.S. 
representative Todd Akin of Mis-
souri, best known for his comments 
regarding “legitimate rape,” is on 
the same committee. Wired maga-
zine complied a list of things other 
members have said regarding cli-
mate change and related issues. 
Suf?ce it to say, not everyone on the 
committee accepts the truth of glob-
al warming, and it’s only the Repub-
lican members who have made such 
statements.
How can this be? Do these Con-
gressmen really not believe in some-
thing for which there is mountains 
of evidence? I’m not so sure. But I 
do know that according to a Gallup 
poll, 46 percent of their constituents 
think God made the human race less 
than 10,000 years ago. It could very 
well be that they’re saying whatever 
people want to hear to get elected, 
but considering Broun is running 
unopposed this year, this might not 
hold true in every case.
Regardless of why such anti-sci-
ence rhetoric exists in our political 
system, the question remains: What 
can we do about it? Science advo-
cates such as Neil deGrasse Tyson 
and Bill Nye attempt to reach out 
to young people, but as I previously 
wrote in The Tartan, this has gar-
nered a rather negative response 
from the kinds of people who vote in 
anti-science legislatures. Clearly we 
need to improve education, but how 
are we supposed to get an educated 
electorate with these anti-science 
people in charge?
Luckily, though, there is hope. 
Just this past week, a Pew report 
showed that those with no religion 
are on the rise and Protestants — 
the religious group that most Cre-
ationists call home — are no longer 
the majority, with about a third of 
those under 30 years old claiming 
no organized faith.
Why is this good? It means that 
presumably public favor with certain 
?avors of fundamentalist dogma are 
on a downslide. People are less like-
ly to accept arguments for or against 
certain laws based on faith alone. 
More progressive views might have 
a chance to be heard without fear 
of being labeled as “against family 
values.” 
There will still be opposition, no 
doubt; the anti-intellectual strain 
in this country is too deep seated to 
disappear overnight. Yet we can be 
reasonably certain that future politi-
cians will have all the more reason 
to study up if they want to stay in 
of?ce.

It’s no secret that students in the 
humanities often struggle to ?nd 
relevant resources in their ?elds at 
Carnegie Mellon. Recently, though, I 
?nally gave Carnegie Mellon’s online 
recruiting system, TartanTrak, a try. 
Speci?cally, I tried using ProNet, a 
tool for current students to connect 
with relevant alumni from a stu-
dent’s major, career interests, indus-
try, and geographic area, in addition 
to other search criteria. The results 
I received were frustrating and dis-
heartening.
As a professional writing major, I 
began my search with a few param-
eters like “professional writing ma-
jor,” “interested in publishing and 
printing,” and “in Pittsburgh, Pa.” 
My search brought zero results. 
Broadening my search to one param-
eter, “professional writing major,” 
yielded six results. Carnegie Mellon 
has thousands of alumni from all 
over the world, and the Department 
of English website boasts “almost 30 
years of experience educating pro-
fessional and technical writers,” and 
only six of these alumni are willing to 
receive an email from me regarding 
my future? I ?nd the notion either 
very sad or very unlikely. In the case 
that only six alumni of my major are 
willing to give back to campus by 
helping current students, some seri-
ous work needs to be done in build-
ing morale and pride in the program.
What about my friends who are 
here studying other majors, such as 
global studies or linguistics? Thor-
oughly intrigued by the lack of re-
sults I received for professional writ-
ing, I also ran searches for “global 
studies major” and “linguistics ma-
jor,” which each yielded zero results. 
If the answer to the lack of support in 
these areas of the humanities is the 
newness of the programs, I ?nd that 
a legitimate argument. But I also feel 
the university and speci?cally Diet-
rich College should have suggestions 
for ?nding resources for students in 
these departments.
The problem I ?nd more likely, 
though, is a lack of communication 
and outreach to alumni in the many 
departments and programs Carnegie 
Mellon has. If TartanTrak is going to 
be marketed by the Career Center as 
a place to explore your options, then 
the claim needs to be true. The uni-
versity has an obligation to reach out 
to alumni in all majors, especially if 
they are going to suggest ProNet as 
a resource to connect with relevant 
alumni.
Other big issues with ProNet also 
need to be addressed before it can 
be seen as a helpful resource for stu-
dents of any major. In my attempts to 
navigate TartanTrak’s ProNet search, 
I ran into a lot of confusion. 
There is a section for specifying 
“College/University” on the search 
page with no explanation for what 
that means. Is the list of schools pre-
sented places that Carnegie Mellon 
alumni also attended? Is it a list of 
schools where a students might want 
to attend after their time at Carnegie 
Mellon?
Along the same train of thought, 
when specifying my state in the 
search box, I could choose between 
“PA” and “Pennsylvania.” Cleaning 
up the search page and adding bet-
ter descriptions and directions are all 
overlooked issues that should be tak-
en care of if the Career Center ever 
expects students to make regular use 
of the website.
ProNet is a great idea in theory. 
Providing undergraduate students 
the opportunity to connect and net-
work with alumni in their ?eld or 
major is an admirable goal. But in or-
der for these connections to happen, 
Carnegie Mellon, and especially Di-
etrich College, needs to reach out to 
more alumni, and the website must 
be made more user friendly.

Ms. CMU, a new organization on 
campus, held a “Who Needs Femi-
nism?” campaign at the Fence last 
week. Its efforts are part of a larger 
campaign that ?rst started at Duke 
University in April and spread like 
wild?re thanks to Facebook and 
Tumblr.
The campaign consists of indi-
viduals holding up signs outlining 
the basic reasons why they are femi-
nists; it’s a “PR” campaign for femi-
nism, to show people all the reasons 
why feminism is still necessary. Ms. 
CMU’s members were trying to get 
Carnegie Mellon students to do the 
same. The one time I walked past 
them at the Fence last week, they 
were clutching a small whiteboard, 
calling out, “Come tell us why you 
need feminism!” Alas, even though 
there were plenty of people walking 
past them, I didn’t see anyone stop.
It’s unfortunate, because Carn-
egie Mellon could use more femi-
nism. There’s still plenty of sexism 
pervasive on campus, a prime ex-
ample being an incident with the 
Fence a few weeks ago. Some Ham-
erschlag residents decided to paint, 
“McGill, I could use a sandwich...” 
on the Fence. On an ensuing con-
versation on The Tartan’s Facebook 
page, many students defended it as 
“just a joke,” dismissing those who 
found it offensive as being overly 
sensitive and humorless.
Consider this: Sandwich jokes 
and other similarly sexist jokes re-
inforce the stereotypes within our 
culture that women are inferior and 
subservient to men.
You may say “So what?” but those 
stereotypes have quantitative conse-
quences. Studies have shown that, 
when members of groups believed 
to be academically inferior — Afri-
can-American or Latino students, or 
women in math and sciences — are 
reminded of their race or gender 
right before taking a test, they will 
get lower scores than they would if 
they weren’t reminded of such ste-
reotyped qualities. It’s a phenome-
non dubbed “stereotype threat,” and 
considering the size of the math and 
science programs here, reinforcing 
these stereotypes is detrimental for 
women in those majors.
Even the administration could 
use a strong dose of feminism. All 
of the deans of our university’s sev-
en different colleges are male, and 
women only make up a little under 
30 percent of the top administrators 
at Carnegie Mellon.
But gender issues aren’t limited 
to underperformance or under-
representation in leadership roles. 
They expand into far more danger-
ous territory. A 2009 report from the 
Center for Public Integrity indicated 
that more than 20 percent of college 
women will be a victim of rape or at-
tempted rape by the time they leave 
college, but a later investigation that 
the Center conducted found that “on 
many campuses, abusive students 
face little more than slaps on the 
wrist.”
Only 12 percent of students 
found “responsible” for rape are ex-
pelled, while the rest merely receive 
practically negligible punishments 
— one student accused of rape was 
found guilty of “sexual contact” and 
was suspended for the following se-
mester, which was a summer semes-
ter during which he would not have 
been taking classes anyway. And 
considering that over half of assaults 
nationwide go unreported, there are 
probably many unreported assaults 
that allow the attackers to go with-
out punishment.
You might think Carnegie Mellon 
is an “elite” school, and thus would 
be immune to such issues. But just 
because we don’t have public con-
versations about assault on this 
campus, that doesn’t mean assault 
doesn’t happen. I know women who 
have been stalked and harassed by 
Carnegie Mellon men. I’ve person-
ally been assaulted by another Carn-
egie Mellon student.
Feminism gives us the space, the 
vocabulary, and the strength to ad-
dress each of these issues head-on. 
It’s personally given me the con?-
dence and ability to overcome the 
issues I’ve faced.
I think Carnegie Mellon needs 
feminism. Do you?

This month, for the ?rst time 
since the start of 2009, the unem-
ployment rate has been below 8 per-
cent. Although many pundits and 
commentators are celebrating this 
milestone in the gradual economic 
recovery we’ve been having, there 
are certain individuals who have 
eyed the 7.8 percent unemployment 
rate with skepticism.
Last week, Jack Welch, a former 
CEO of General Electric, came out 
with the theory that the Obama 
administration ?xed the unemploy-
ment numbers for political advan-
tage in the month before the elec-
tion. In an op-ed for The Wall Street 
Journal, Welch stated that it was 
highly suspect that the unemploy-
ment rate would have dropped from 
8.3 percent to 7.8 percent in the span 
of two months. He did not, however, 
offer any concrete evidence of any al-
leged numbers-?xing.
Noted economists, such as Nobel 
Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz of Co-
lumbia University and Paul Krugman 
of Princeton University, sharply criti-
cized the “jobs-number conspiracy,” 
and for good reason. Welch’s state-
ments display a deep ignorance of 
the economic and political realities 
in the U.S.
Fixing the jobs numbers would 
be an act of political stupidity on 
behalf of the Obama administra-
tion. The Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS), which collects economic data 
on the state of employment, has civil 
servants with various political af?li-
ations that have worked over many 
administrations. Its data is avail-
able to the public and can be easily 
veri?ed. 
Someone would have blown the 
whistle if the jobs number had been 
falsi?ed. It is highly unlikely that 
President Barack Obama would en-
gage in such an easily discoverable 
fraud a month before the election. If 
it did not entirely sabotage his chanc-
es for re-election, it would certainly 
risk a Watergate-esque investigation 
after Nov. 11.
Secondly, the jobs numbers are 
not out of line with the data collected 
in the past year. While the BLS’s es-
timates of unemployment vary with-
in 0.1-0.2 percentage points each 
month, they do show a general trend 
of real — albeit slow — job growth 
over the last few years. Furthermore, 
the BLS tends to undercount jobs 
during recoveries because the survey 
of employers that they use to deter-
mine the rate often does not take 
into account newly established busi-
nesses. This is what happened over 
the months of July and August, and 
subsequent BLS revisions to those 
numbers show that there have been 
50,000 more jobs created than previ-
ously thought.
For students, the improvement 
in the unemployment rate suggests 
real cause for celebration. For once, 
the rate this month has dropped not 
because people have stopped looking 
for jobs, but because there is an ac-
tual increase in the number of jobs. 
Furthermore, there has been an in-
crease in the number of full-time jobs 
for Americans age 16–24. Although 
the future of the economy is still un-
certain, these past few weeks have 
given us something to be optimistic 
about.

A PERSON’S OPINION

Why social issues still matter in this presidential election
JOSH SMITH
Kyle Henson wrote an article for 
The Tartan last week, “Economy 
must be top issue for young voters,” 
that emphasized that it takes no lead-
ership or skill for politicians to take 
a stance on social issues. The article 
also made the case for young voters to 
vote based solely on the economic is-
sues of the nation, since social issues 
will remain stagnant due to the in-
eptitude of our country’s politicians.
Henson asks if we are naive 
enough to make any issue more im-
portant than the economy and our 
future job prospects. While I agree 
that the economy is one of the most 
important problems facing the coun-
try today, to disregard social issues 
and other obstacles plaguing the 
nation as secondary to and entirely 
dependent on our ?nancial future is 
equally naive. 
Additionally, while it is easy to 
criticize politicians on both sides of 
the aisle for their lack of action, it is 
by no means reason to disregard the 
personal or public stances of all poli-
ticians on social issues as irrelevant 
or inconsequential.
First, I’ll address the current po-
litical landscape. I share Henson’s 
discontent for politicians who don’t 
follow through with promises on 
which they run their campaigns, and 
for a Congress that is entrenched in 
partisanship, endless repeals, and 
little compromise. But to shrug off 
President Barack Obama, presiden-
tial candidate Mitt Romney, and the 
entirety of Congress as completely 
passive and unable to take a stance 
on social issues is ignorant.
It is a far cry to say that Obama 
and Romney share the same view 
on marriage equality. Henson claims 
that, “Both want to leave it to the 
states to decide if same-sex couples 
can get married,” yet Romney’s cam-
paign website states that the Repub-
lican candidate will “champion a 
Federal Marriage Amendment to the 
Constitution de?ning marriage as be-
tween one man and one woman.”
But this might all be hot air, since 
how often does legislation on social 
issues come to fruition? Henson can 
only recall Congress’ measure to “de-
clare pizza a vegetable” (which wasn’t 
what happened, but that’s beside the 
point) as an example of our legisla-
tive branch’s recent achievements.
I’d like to jog his memory with the 
Congressional repeal of “Don’t ask, 
don’t tell” (DADT) in 2010, a land-
mark for gay rights in the U.S. The 
repeal of this unconstitutional segre-
gation is only the start of a movement 
for equal rights for all Americans. To 
say the status quo on social issues 
isn’t changing is utterly false.
If DADT or marriage equal-
ity doesn’t personally affect you, this 
past summer Congress passed a bill 
that prevented subsidized Stafford 
loan interest rates for students from 
doubling to 6.8 percent for this aca-
demic year. 
Some may see this as an economic 
issue, but I see it as a social issue. The 
country has an ethical imperative to 
help students gain access to afford-
able, high-quality education, which 
more than anything else will help 
bring the nation out of any turmoil 
or crisis.
Social issues are far from a stag-
nant arena. Many baby boomers in 
politics on both sides of the aisle are 
stubbornly entrenched in their be-
liefs and viewpoints. 
But soon they will have to make 
way for our generation. I believe our 
generation of political leaders will be 
more open-minded, more willing to 
listen to and consider the opposition, 
and less shackled by an aging, two-
party, black-and-white view of the 
political system.
Secondly, I’ll address the prioriti-
zation of economic issues for young 
voters. Henson cites an article from 
the Associated Press that says 53.6 
percent of college graduates under 
the age of 25 are jobless or underem-
ployed. However, that same article 
states that in 2000, well before the 
Great Recession and Obama, that 
percentage was at a low of 41 percent. 
An increase of 12.6 percent is 
nothing to scoff at, but it provides 
more context to the situation.
Regardless, Henson’s argument 
hinges on this claim that, “If you can’t 
pay for an abortion or your same-sex 
wedding, it’s not going to happen 
whether it’s legal or not.” It’s overly 
simplistic to think that every aspect 
of our society must take a backseat to 
revenue and expenditures.
Henson fails to realize a crucial 
aspect of this nation and its citizens. 
It’s not the economy that drives and 
sustains America: It’s people. It’s the 
values and passions that get us out 
of bed every morning to follow our 
vocations. Through our virtues and 
actions, we will leave behind a legacy 
to our children — hopefully a legacy 
that we’re proud to stand by. 
The true cost of modern times on 
future generations won’t only be the 
burdens of our economy: It will also 
be how we faced injustice, ignorance, 
and oppression.
On Nov. 6, my vote will be for the 
candidate who is best aligned to act 
in accordance with my beliefs on all 
issues. Young voters: I have the ut-
most con?dence in you. I implore you 
to vote likewise, whether I agree with 
you or not. Don’t let others dictate 
whom you should vote for or what 
you should base your vote on.

After the ?rst presidential debate 
on Oct. 3, many people wondered 
why President Barack Obama per-
formed so poorly. Was it the high al-
titude? Was it the fact that his 20th 
wedding anniversary fell on the same 
date? These theories only distract 
from the main reason that — in ad-
dition to the demands of a reelection 
— Obama has a pretty stressful job.
The thing about being the Presi-
dent of the United States is that ev-
eryone else knows how to do the job, 
but no one else actually wants to do it, 
because to do so requires running for 
president. And running for president 
in the 21st century is, quite frankly, 
awful. Everything you’ve ever done 
in your life is up for grabs and blown 
out of proportion.
Obama is learning this the hard 
way. In 2008, his assurances of hope 
and change left him unscathed by the 
cynical media. Huge expectations 
were placed on him. He was going 
to be this; he was going to do that. 
Granted, Obama only fed America’s 
infatuation with his blind optimism.
After four years, the sobering re-
alization that hope and change have 
little swaying power over partisan 
discord has left many Americans 
frustrated with our political system 
and its leaders. The pervading nega-
tivity of the current presidential cam-
paign only reinforces the cynicism of 
those political leaders. One can only 
wonder how the man at the top has 
handled this blistering campaign and 
his fall from invincibility.
He seems to be, by most accounts, 
an introvert. The same man who 
electri?es crowds of thousands has 
trouble cozying up to donors with fat 
wallets. While this trait can be a great 
quality in a leader, it can sometimes 
be self-defeating. He is not Repub-
lican candidate Mitt Romney, who 
can easily shake his Etch-a-Sketch 
—  erasing a history of mudslinging 
through the Republican primaries — 
to win some votes. Obama is his own 
biggest critic, and with that comes a 
lot of unnecessary stress.
On Oct. 3, Obama stood at the 
University of Denver stressed with 
the challenges of a recession and the 
hectic schedule of a reelection. How-
ever, it wasn’t the external pressures 
that caused his listless performance. 
It was the stress he puts on himself. 
He has a mountain of troubles, but 
doesn’t seem to ask for anyone’s 
sympathies. His fatherless childhood 
shaped him into the untrusting, do-it-
yourself man he is. It’s what’s gotten 
him here, but it’s also hurting him.
In a CNN/ORC International poll 
released on Aug. 26, 53 percent of 
likely voters felt that Obama cares 
about the needs of people compared 
to 39 percent for Romney. But how 
many of us truly care about our Presi-
dent and his well-being?
I feel sorry for him. He’s got it 
tough and it will probably get worse. 
In the meantime, the man could use 
a hug.

No lack of parties for voters to choose from in November
KYLE HENSON
Currently on the ballot in the state 
of Pennsylvania are four presidential 
candidates representing four differ-
ent parties. They are Democratic Par-
ty nominee President Barack Obama, 
Republican Party nominee Mitt Rom-
ney, Green Party nominee Jill Stein, 
and Libertarian Party nominee Gary 
Johnson.
But there are even more political 
parties out there than you or I have 
ever heard of, one being the Socialist 
Equality Party that has been putting 
up ?yers around campus. There’s also 
the Constitution Party, the Justice 
Party, the Peace and Freedom Party, 
and the Reform Party, started in 1995 
by Ross Perot, who gained 20 percent 
of vote in the 1992 presidential elec-
tion as an Independent candidate.
Yet despite all this, people com-
plain daily about the injustices of the 
two party system, and how they’d 
vote for Johnson if he just had a 
chance of winning. 
If we have a two-party system, 
then it’s entirely self-in?icted. Politi-
cal parties aren’t even mentioned in 
the Constitution, and there’s abso-
lutely nothing systemic about two-
party dominance.
Perot polled strongly enough in 
1992 to be included in the presiden-
tial debates, and people speculate 
that he would’ve have a much better 
shot at winning had he not dropped 
out and re-entered the race only a 
month before the election. It’s en-
tirely possible for a challenger to be 
taken seriously and take the White 
House.
If everyone who wanted a third 
party to enter the fray and really 
change the trajectory of the nation 
went out and voted for that candidate 
rather than for either the Republican 
and Democratic nominee, that can-
didate would begin to be taken seri-
ously and maybe even win a race. At 
the very least, that candidate’s plat-
form would be absorbed into the cur-
rent two parties, which has happened 
consistently to almost every third 
party in our nation’s history.
The Republicans started as a con-
glomerate of the Free-Soilers, Green-
backs, Anti-Masons, Whigs, and 
Know-Nothings. The Populists of the 
1890s were absorbed into the Pro-
gressives, which were then absorbed 
by the Democratic Party. Finally, Pe-
rot’s platform of ?scal solvency was 
absorbed into the Republican Party 
in 1994, when the U.S. ran a bal-
anced budget for four years.
On an interesting note, Johnson 
and the Libertarian Party have ?led 
an anti-trust lawsuit against the Re-
publican and Democratic parties for 
not allowing him to enter the debates. 
This is entirely unprecedented 
and certainly won’t have any dis-
cernible outcome until well after the 
election, but it’ll be interesting to see 
where it goes. Current policy on the 
debates is that 15 percent support 
in the polls gets you a podium. This 
further reinforces the need for peo-
ple disheartened with our current 
two parties to support an alternative. 
We’re not lacking for options, just for 
people willing to stand up for what 
they truly believe in.
If you don’t like Obama or Rom-
ney, please vote for someone else. 
Give your support to Johnson or 
Stein. 
You’ll be giving that candidate a 
much-needed bump, and, if enough 
people follow your trajectory, you’ll 
contribute to our democracy. Hope-
fully, you’ll see your will enacted 
either through that third party, or 
through an existing party that des-
perately needs your vote.

Tartans defeat Rochester 1–0
ABBY SMITH
Junior Staffwriter
The women’s soccer team 
continued to boost its confer-
ence success with a 1–0 win 
over the University of Roches-
ter last Friday and a 3–1 victo-
ry over Case Western Reserve 
University yesterday.
The 24th ranked Tartans’ 
record improved to 9–1–2 
overall and 3–1–0 in the Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) conference as the Uni-
versity of Rochester Yellow-
jackets fell to a 0–3–0 UAA 
record.
The Tartans exhibited a 
strong offense, putting plenty 
of pressure on Rochester dur-
ing the ?rst half. The pressure 
culminated at the 33-minute 
mark when junior defender 
Rachel Contopoulos kicked 
the ball to ?rst-year mid?eld-
er Carson Quiros, who head-
ed the ball to senior forward 
Brianna Magill for a goal. The 
goal marked Magill’s third of 
the season, giving the Tartans 
a one-point advantage.
The second half was 
marked by impressive de-
fense on both sides and strong 
offensive attempts by the 
Tartans. Senior Mitra Ebra-
himi shot just too wide at the 
51-minute mark, while junior 
forward Cecilia Zischkau shot 
a header that went just above 
the goalbox at the 68-minute 
mark. Contopoulos continued 
her efforts with numerous 
goal attempts as well.
The Tartans were able 
to maintain its advantage 
throughout the game with an 
all-around team effort.
“I am really proud of our 
team for stepping up each 
game to the challenge. We 
play each game as the most 
important one of the season 
and it is de?nitely paying off. 
With only four more UAA 
games, we have the motiva-
tion to keep outplaying our 
opponents and getting victo-
ries,” senior mid?elder Steph-
anie Hare said.
The Tartans will travel to 
face Grove City College this 
Thursday in hopes of main-
taining their national ranking 
and strong record.

Men’s soccer suffers ?rst loss
GABRIELLE WEST
Junior Staffwriter
The Tartan men’s soccer 
team experienced its ?rst con-
ference loss, 3–2, in double 
overtime to the University of 
Rochester on Friday night, 
and defeated Case Western 
Reserve University yesterday 
4–0.
Carnegie Mellon is now 
9–2–1 overall and 2–1–1 in 
the University Athletic Asso-
ciation conference.
The University of Roches-
ter Yellowjackets started the 
game aggressively and scored 
a goal within the ?rst four 
minutes of play. 
The Tartans answered 
with a shot by junior mid-
?elder Chris Wysocki that 
?nished just above the goal in 
the 14th minute. Soon after, 
Rochester came back with an-
other goal in the 21st minute 
to pull up to a 2–0 lead. The 
remainder of the ?rst half in-
cluded two unsuccessful shots 
by both teams.
Within the ?rst 44 seconds 
of the second half, Tartans, 
junior mid?elder Mike Fer-
raco scored his second goal of 
the season, bringing his team 
within one point of the lead.
For the following 15 min-
utes, the Tartans continued 
to get openings at the goal, 
but were just short of scoring 
until a second penalty kick 
by junior forward Max Tas-
sano put the team back on the 
scoreboard.
The rest of regular play 
resulted in two unsuccessful 
shots by the Tartans and Yel-
lowjackets.
Overtime began with a 
score of 2–2 and resulted in 
two shots from the Tartans, 
consisting of one shot from 
Wysocki that was saved by the 
Yellowjackets goalkeeper and 
a header from senior defender 
Alex Abedian that landed just 
wide of the goal.
In the second overtime 
period, the Tartans got an-
other two shots, but neither 
connected with the net. With 
2:19 remaining, the Yellow-
jackets scored the ?nal goal, 
leaving the score 3–2.
“An unfortunate way to 
end an incredible comeback. 
We had them on their heels 
all second half and in [over-
time], but couldn’t get that 
third goal. This game proved 
that even with a great group 
of guys like we have that there 
is still room for improvement. 
An early 2–0 de?cit makes the 
game unnecessarily dif?cult,” 
Abedian said.
The Tartans will travel to 
Grove City to play the Grove 
City College Wolverines this 
Wednesday at 4 p.m.

Men’s tennis defeats nationally ranked Amherst 5–4
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
After the men’s tennis 
team’s slow start to the fall 
season, the Tartans ?nished 
in strong fashion. On Oct. 6, 
the Tartans took on Robert 
Morris University, defeating 
the Division-I school 9–0. The 
match was the perfect warm-
up for the team’s match on 
Oct. 7 against No. 2 nationally 
ranked Amherst College. The 
Tartans defeated the Amherst 
Lord Jeffs in a close 5–4 match 
after coming back from a 3–0 
de?cit in doubles.
“Especially given the qual-
ity of the team we were com-
peting against, it was hands 
down the most impressive 
comeback I’ve seen in my 10 
years at Carnegie Mellon,” 
head coach Andrew Girard 
said. “To win ?ve straight set 
singles matches against an 
opponent like Amherst shows 
that our team is capable of 
beating anyone this year. This 
very well may be the strongest 
and deepest team we’ve ever 
had. An outstanding way to 
wrap up our fall season.”
Despite rain in the fore-
cast, the Tartans managed to 
?t in the match against Robert 
Morris University.
The Tartans started with 
doubles, and ?rst off the court 
was No. 3 duo of sophomores 
Bryce Beisswanger and Chris-
tian Heaney-Secord, with a 
score of 8–3. Next off the court 
with a closer match was No. 1 
doubles team of senior Duke 
Miller and sophomore Wil-
liam Duncan. Rounding out 
the 3–0 doubles sweep came 
from No. 2 doubles, the newly 
formed team of sophomore 
Thomas Cooper and ?rst-year 
Kosuke Hasegawa, 9–8.
The Tartans took the court 
for singles and won every 
match. The ?rst off the court 
was Heaney-Secord at No. 1 
singles with a 6–2, 6–3 victo-
ry. Miller at No. 2 singles fol-
lowed suit, winning 6–4, 6–4. 
Hasegawa won without drop-
ping a single game at No. 3 
singles. Duncan ?nished next, 
only dropping three games 
with a 6–2, 6–1 victory at No. 
5 singles.
Senior Harsha Rao, No. 6 
singles, took out his opponent 
6–1, 6–0. No. 4 singles player 
senior Jooho Yu battled to a 
three-set tie-breaker, winning 
7–6, 6–2, 10–6 to conclude 
the match.
The next day, the Tartans’ 
match was moved to an earlier 
time in an effort to avoid rain. 
They took the court against 
the Lord Jeffs starting with 
doubles. Despite the tough 
?ght, the team lost all three 
doubles matches. The Lord 
Jeffs defeated No. 1 team of 
Miller and Duncan 8–5, and 
then took out No. 3 team of 
Beisswanger and Heaney-Se-
cord 8–4. The Tartans’ No. 2 
doubles team of Cooper and 
Hasegawa resisted the lon-
gest, but eventually fell 9–7.
The Tartans started singles 
play with a 3–0 de?cit, but 
this did not stop them from 
winning the match. First-year 
Yuvraj Kumar led the Tartans 
with the team’s ?rst victory of 
the day at No. 4 singles, win-
ning 6–0, 6–4. Duncan fol-
lowed suit, winning his match 
at No. 6 singles 6–1, 6–4. 
First-year Abhishek Alla kept 
the ball rolling with his match 
at No. 3 singles, winning 6–4, 
6–4.
After a rain delay and a 
move indoors, the Tartans 
maintained the momentum. 
Heaney-Secord won at No. 
1 singles 6–2, 6–3, increas-
ing the lead to 4–3 and set up 
the team for a win. Miller lost 
at No. 2 singles bringing the 
match at 4–4. Hasegawa was 
the last Tartan on the court, 
and after a well-fought battle, 
won his match 7–5, 7–5, seal-
ing the Tartan victory.
Assistant coach Mike Bel-
monte was proud of the team’s 
comeback.
“We certainly didn’t go 
into the match thinking we 
would lose all three doubles 
points, but we knew that we 
had the talent at every other 
spot to compete with Am-
herst, and our guys proved 
us right,” he said. “It was a 
very hard-fought and well-
deserved comeback victory 
for us, and we are going to use 
it to launch ourselves into the 
spring season.”
The team will begin its 
spring season in February 
with its ?rst match against 
the West Virginia Wesleyan 
College Bobcats. This match 
will be hosted by the Tartans 
at one of the team’s indoor fa-
cilities.

SPORTS COMMENTARYPressure is on for players of the Big Apple
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
Senior running back and captain of the Carnegie Mellon 
football team Jake Nardone injured his right knee earlier this 
season. He has been contemplating whether to redshirt the rest 
of the football season and come back next year to play one more 
season, or to pursue a career. Prior to his injury, Nardone re-
ceived All-UAA honors twice, achieving First Team All-UAA as a 
sophomore and Second Team All-UAA as a junior. 
Nardone is majoring in business administration, with a track 
in ?nance. If he decides to graduate this year, he is interested in 
pursing a career in sales and trading. “The most rewarding part 
of being a CMU athlete is that you know you are one of the few 
people who can succeed both athletically and academically at 
one of the most challenging private universities in the country,” 
Nardone said.
Nardone’s injury occurred this season in the game against 
Catholic University. “I was playing with a sore hamstring. I was 
playing well, but right before halftime, I made a sharp cut to 
break away from a safety and I heard a sharp pop in my knee. 
I think that I was relying too much on my knee because of the 
hamstring injury,” he said.
The timetable for this type of injury is anywhere from seven 
to 12 months. “If I choose to play a redshirt senior year, I would 
be ready to play next season,” Nardone said.
Meanwhile, Nardone has limited mobility and is currently 
undergoing treatment on campus. “Every day I go to treatment 
in the athletic training room. Adam Hindes has been a tremen-
dous help working me through the pain to get my knee back into 
playing condition. Also, two days a week, [physical therapists] 
from UPMC stop by to check my recovery status. It has been dif-
?cult so far, but I know that it is well worth it,” he said.
Nardone doesn’t want to miss out on spending time with the 
team. “The aspect of football that I love the most is the camara-
derie within the locker room. No matter what, I know that being 
with the guys is going to lift my spirits,” he said.
Despite being injured, Nardone has been remained active on 
the team. “I just show up with the same positive attitude that I 
always have,” he said. “The challenges you face in life are never 
the same, but the mindset you take to conquer them should nev-
er falter. That is why I am able to stay positive.”
“When thinking about Jake, not just one aspect stands out 
from the rest of who he is as a person,” senior outside linebacker 
Owen Parker said. “It is quite perplexing because as a player, 
captain, leader, and teammate, he is what I consider to be the 
cream of the crop. When I look back on my college experience, 
I without hesitation believe he is the most genuine and caring 
person I have met both on and off the ?eld.”
One way Nardone stays active within the team is by setting 
goals for himself and his teammates. “The goal for myself is to 
continue to be a strong leader through the injury process,” Nar-
done said. “It is so dif?cult as a captain to not be out there every 
day on the ?eld, but I can still show the guys that my heart is still 
with the team and that we have come this far together, that we 
have so much more to work for.” 
“My goal for the team is for each member to remember that 
they are a part of something bigger than themselves and to con-
tinue to work hard and improve everyday,” he added. “I know 
that if this team is able to do that the amount of success we will 
have in wins will speak for itself.”
Whether Nardone decides to redshirt and stay for another 
year or not, he feels that “football has been a huge part of my ex-
perience at CMU. The sport has helped me stay focused through 
the academic rigors, and it has also led to countless great friend-
ships that I will take with me for the rest of my life.”
“I just want to thank everyone that has reached out to me and 
encouraged me through the injury and rehab process, because 
it has made such a difference to see that people care about your 
well-being,” he said.

The media in New York 
is unlike any other. It’s more 
aggressive than most, and is 
easily the most critical with 
failures and shortcomings put 
under a microscope.
Just ask New York Jets 
quarterback Mark Sanchez 
and New York Yankees third 
baseman Alex Rodriguez.
Last week, both athletes 
were reviled in the Big Ap-
ple. While their inability to 
perform anywhere close to 
professional level is cause for 
grievance, the New York me-
dia has had a momentous ef-
fect on the national opinion of 
these two athletes.
In the midst of a tightly 
contested American League 
Divisional Series against the 
Baltimore Orioles, Rodriguez 
is batting an appalling two for 
15, with nine strikeouts. He 
has struck out at least twice 
in every playoff game this 
season. For a guy who is paid 
about $27.5 million a year for 
his offense, any criticism is 
credible.
Sanchez has been consis-
tently one of the worst play-
ers, playing one of the most 
important positions on what 
should be one of the better 
teams in the National Football 
League. His 66.6 passer rat-
ing and six interceptions are 
hellish statistics, to say the 
least, and he’s led his team to 
a subpar 2–3 start. As if play-
ing poorly in New York wasn’t 
enough, the polarizing and 
enigmatic quarterback, Tim 
Tebow, remains his backup 
and the favored choice of New 
York fans.
Playing in New York is a 
much bigger beast than play-
ing anywhere else. We have 
seen good athletes come to 
New York and choke under 
the heavy weight of the big 
media market. Pitcher A.J. 
Burnett was pretty good as a 
Florida Marlin and a Toronto 
Blue Jay before coming to the 
Yankees.
But, in New York, he was 
34–35 and never had an 
earned run average (ERA) be-
low four; in two of his three 
seasons in New York, he had 
an ERA over ?ve.
New York Knicks forward 
Carmelo Anthony continues 
to be criticized for being un-
able to lift his team to the level 
of championship contention, 
despite putting up similar 
numbers to what he was able 
to do as a Denver Nugget. The 
cases of Burnett and Anthony 
illustrate two different sce-
narios: simply being unable 
to perform with the New York-
sized weight on your shoul-
ders and being unable to live 
up to unrealistic expectations.
During Rodriguez’s hor-
rible playoff performance — 
something that has happened 
consistently in his time as a 
Yankee — the columnists and 
journalists have fed like vul-
tures on his failures. Articles 
condemning Rodriguez for 
not being completely commit-
ted to the team’s success or or-
dering manager Joe Girardi to 
bump Rodriguez down in the 
batting order are in vast sup-
ply.
For Sanchez, it has been 
no better. Articles bombarded 
the news questioning when 
Tebow would unseat Sanchez 
as the Jets’ starting quarter-
back. As head coach Rex Ryan 
continues to make Sanchez 
his starter, the media has con-
tinued to balloon the attacks 
to start the less skilled Tebow 
over the struggling quarter-
back.
But Sanchez’s performance 
hasn’t been signi?cantly worse 
than his career numbers.
When you look at football 
teams in New York, it is hard 
to believe — based on the me-
dia coverage — that the New 
York Giants had just won the 
Superbowl.
Quarterback Eli Manning, 
fresh off winning the Super-
bowl MVP, is the third most 
talked about quarterback in 
New York behind Sanchez and 
Tebow.
For some, the pressure of 
New York is too much to han-
dle. Maybe Sanchez would be 
better suited in a smaller mar-
ket. Perhaps the expectations 
for him are just too high, and 
the numbers he puts up will 
attract less criticism in a dif-
ferent city. 
We know Rodriguez can 
bring it: His offensive num-
bers are some of the best the 
MLB has ever seen. But is the 
weight of 27 World Series 
victories too much pressure? 
He has consistently under-
performed in the playoffs as a 
Yankee.
The media is a vicious 
monster, and there is none 
more vicious than a writer in 
New York. But the media is a 
public service, and its aggres-
siveness parallels its fans.
There is no escaping that 
monster in New York because 
all they expect in the Big Ap-
ple is championship success.
Athletic website gets  new interactive page
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Ath-
letics website recently under-
went a major overhaul. The 
site was given a complete 
facelift with larger photos 
and a greater emphasis on 
fan interaction. The site was 
introduced to Carnegie Mel-
lon on Sept. 28.
The athletics depart-
ment is thrilled by the new  
website. Director of Athlet-
ics Susan Bassett said, “Our 
Athletics Communication 
staff conducted an excellent 
process including athletics 
department staff and col-
leagues from across campus 
to produce a website that re-
?ects the department vision 
and mission.”
According to Associate Di-
rector of Athletics Josh Cen-
tor, the site has been rede-
signed to showcase Carnegie 
Mellon athletes “on and off 
the ?eld of play.” 
The new Fan Zone button 
links users to a page contain-
ing stories about athlete and 
alumni activities outside 
their sport in addition to 
the Captain’s Chair section, 
which showcases a team cap-
tain’s experiences with Tar-
tan athletics and their leader-
ship experiences.
Fans can now easily ?nd 
multiple sports calendars, re-
sults, and live webcasting sta-
tistics to better follow sport-
ing events and games, even 
if they cannot be there in 
person. The new website has 
the opportunity for more “dy-
namic content,” Centor said.
While the website has un-
dergone stylistic and organi-
zational redesign, much of 
the content is the same. The 
human interest stories about 
the athletes and alumni and 
the Captain’s Chair were on 
the previous site, but were 
harder to locate. Junior bio-
logical studies and Russian 
histories double major and 
Science and Humanities 
Scholar Brendan MacNabb 
plays on the baseball team 
and writes the recaps of the 
games, so he often uses the 
athletics website. “While the 
site looks much better stylis-
tically, some of the content is 
still lacking,” he said.
This website is “a great ve-
hicle to tell the story of some 
fantastic men and women,” 
Centor said. “We are thrilled 
with the redesign.”

Phipps exhibit transports viewers 
Tropical Forest India highlights Indian culture, horticulture
The perfect exotic escape from midterm stress lies 
not across the ocean, but simply across campus 
in the Tropical Forest India exhibit at Phipps 
Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.
According to the exhibition website, Tropical Forest 
India was exhaustively researched and planned for 
over a year by Assistant Curator of Horticulture Ben 
Dunigan and interpretive specialist Jordyn Melino, 
and this extensive research shows in the final 
product. The exhibit is more than just a collection of 
plants: It’s a green teleporter of flora and fauna that 
whisks you away to the forests of India.
Cheery impatiens are dotted throughout, 
accompanied by tea plants. Palms with gigantic 
leaves stand over hundreds of plant varieties. The 
impossibly thick vegetation is swathed in fog from a 
fog machine. A “river” flows through the room that 
houses the exhibit, lined with dainty purple blooms 
and vibrant green leaves.
The exhibit goes beyond just displaying tropical 
plants and some dirt, incorporating interesting 
cultural tidbits and extra displays throughout. 
Among these are waterfalls, the river, and a quaint 
Indian bazaar that displays different varieties of 
teas and spices native to the country. Also featured 
is a collection of field research that highlights the 
work of botanists around the world, an outpost that 
features the medicinal uses of the plants and, of 
course, as much tropical forest as can be packed 
into one room in Pittsburgh.
The vast array of species spills over from the 
carefully designed beds onto the winding pathway, 
truly transforming the room into a little slice of 
paradise. Immediately upon walking through the 
doorway — which is decorated with an Indian 
temple façade — visitors experience a sense of 
peace and tranquility mixed with a dose of ancient 
wisdom. Plants labeled with tags that beg, “Smell 
me, I’m fragrant!” are the first to welcome visitors 
with their powerful and sweet scent, setting the 
vibe for the entire exhibit. At the charming Indian 
bazaar just down the path from the waterfall, 
samples of tea and spices create an aromatic 
bouquet.
Besides the pleasant scents and the explosion of 
exotic flora, the exhibit is packed with signposts 
that feature interesting facts about the country, 
its culture, and its native plants. The Ayurvedic 
healing garden and outpost highlight the interwoven 
histories of the religious culture and medicinal uses 
of the plants growing in the exhibit. It’s interesting 
and educational to browse the easy-to-ingest 
information presented in a fun, original way, and to 
find out how many uses the Indian culture has for 
the plants that surround it.
A unique Pittsburgh gem, Phipps is a wonderful 
escape that mesmerizes and immediately calms. 
There’s something about being surrounded by lush 
greenery that feels cleansing and healthy. Take 
advantage of this amazing place: It’s just across 
Flagstaff Hill, it’s free for Carnegie Mellon students, 
and it’s open until 10 p.m. on Friday nights.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I am so busy with school 
and sleeping that I don’t 
have time to catch up on 
True Blood. I need my 
erotic vampire fix! How 
can I fix this?
Thanks,
Tense Vampire Fun-time 
Action Needed
Dear TV FAN,
Well, there’s your problem 
right there: You like True 
Blood. This may get me 
in trouble with my female 
readers, but it’s just not a 
good show. However, until 
the Men in Black (they’re 
real) commercialize their 
memory erasing technology, 
you can’t unwatch the show. 
In that case, you might as 
well finish it, since the series 
is already over. Luckily, now 
you can fast-forward through 
all the boring exposition and 
stick to the sex scenes.
Your problem here is simply 
one of time management. 
Luckily, since you’ve decided 
to go ahead and skip all 
the boring bits, watching a 
whole season should only 
take half an hour or so. If 
you’re actually in it for the 
story and the characters, 
then you’re watching the 
wrong show. Since you 
seem to be an HBO fan, 
watch The Wire. It’s not as 
dirty, but has a great plot 
and characters. If you still 
want some juicy scenes, try 
Deadwood.
As a Carnegie Mellon 
student, you shouldn’t be 
sleeping anyway,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
A lot of people say I’m 
narcissistic because I 
often talk about how 
handsome I am. But I 
can’t help being so good-
looking! Is there anything 
I can do to change 
people’s opinions of me?
Thanks,
Desirable, Attractive 
Person Penalized 
Erroneously, Regardless 
Desire Advice Now
Dear DAPPER DAN,
It’s hard for us handsome 
folk sometimes, but don’t 
let the regular people get 
you down. They can’t help 
but be jealous of those 
cheekbones. You need to 
keep that in mind when 
you’re dealing with them. 
They don’t need constant 
reminders about how good-
looking you are; they get that 
whenever they look at you. 
You don’t need to rub in the 
fact that they were beaten 
with an ugly stick.
However, maybe you 
still need that constant 
affirmation that you are 
attractive. You could do 
what girls do and say you 
look ugly or fat so your 
friends have to compliment 
you. Note that this doesn’t 
work if your friends are jerks; 
they’ll just wind up agreeing 
with you. Nothing wrong 
with being a tad narcissistic; 
just don’t stare into a river 
too long.
Mythological jokes are 
funny,
Patrick Hoskins

Halcyon, Ellie Goulding’s second album, is not bad. But 
it isn’t particularly great, either.
Goulding’s debut, Lights, came out in 2010 to critical 
acclaim and widespread popularity in both the United 
Kingdom and the U.S. Lights was extremely successful 
and featured songs such as the titular track “Lights,” 
“Starry Eyed,” and “Your Song.” Her debut was a little 
indie and a little electropop, and those two elements 
blended seamlessly, along with Goulding’s vocals, to 
create a good collection of songs.
Halcyon tries to mix up that old formula a little bit, and 
Goulding should be commended for that. Too often, 
musicians lean on their old successes for fear of trying 
something new. Goulding moved away from the indie 
?avor of her ?rst album, and Halcyon is much more 
deeply rooted in a pop and synthetic sound.
Unfortunately, Goulding’s voice is perhaps better suited 
to the ?rst genre. Too many wordless vocals clash with 
electronic upbeat instrumentals, which creates a jarring 
juxtaposition in several of the album’s songs. “Don’t Say 
A Word,” the ?rst track of the album, tries just a little 
too hard to be ethereal and consequently falls short. 
In the track “Atlantis,” Goulding’s voice is too high 
and too slow, and “Dead in the Water” is too sparse 
on the instrumentals. Goulding tries to use the lack of 
instruments to complement her vocals, but the attempt 
?ops somewhat awkwardly.
This album repeatedly relies too much on her voice, 
perhaps copying the style of the hugely successful 
Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine. When 
Florence + the Machine chooses to fall back on vocals, 
the technique works, because Welch has an incredibly 
strong voice. Goulding has an absolutely lovely voice, 
but it’s not strong enough to carry this particular 
album, especially because she competes with her own 
instrumentals at times.
That being said, Halcyon is not all bad. Both “Only You” 
and “I Need Your Love” have the catchy strangeness 
that Goulding was going for in the whole album. 
“Figure 8” blends Goulding’s voice with the electropop 
accompaniment effectively. She is still a talented artist 
with a beautiful voice; the songs on her second album 
just do not showcase those talents as effectively as her 
?rst album did. Her songs might also exhibit her talents 
better if she were to choose more diverse subject matter; 
most of her songs detail the trials and tribulations of her 
love life.
The problem in Halcyon is that none of its songs has the 
same simple beauty as “Lights” or “Starry Eyed.” Part 
of what made Goulding so popular was the simplicity of 
her early works: The songs were not complex, but they 
were alluring. While not all of the songs in her debut 
album were perfect, they all smoothly maintained that 
simplicity; none of them sounded overworked. Halcyon, 
with its heavy use of electronic sound, has somehow 
lost that simple elegance. It’s worth a listen, but it’s not 
Lights.

Ellie Goulding’s second album falls ?at
Halcyon attempts different genre than Lights, but ends up more jarring than enjoyable
Transcendental Youth is no sonic revolution for the 
Mountain Goats. But then, who was really looking for 
one? After 20 years of being led by vocalist, lyricist, 
guitarist, and keyboardist John Darnielle, the Mountain 
Goats have established a predictable but strongly 
effective sound.
Every song in the new album sounds familiar without 
sounding rehashed, much like an old friend’s new 
escapades showing up on your Facebook feed. But 
sonic atmosphere is not the soul of the Mountain Goats’ 
music; it is the lyrics that truly de?ne the band’s musical 
accomplishments. The Mountain Goats’ musical output 
is much like the bibliography of a well-established, 
prodigious author: linguistic magic delivered in crisp 
packaging.
While Transcendental Youth won’t sway any of the 
band’s detractors, it is an excellent listen for both 
veteran fans and for those who have never heard of the 
band. Continuing in the trend of more recent Mountain 
Goats albums, Darnielle is supported by bassist Peter 
Hughes and drummer John Wurster (better known for his 
work with Superchunk). The band creates sounds that 
complement Darnielle’s lyrics perfectly, whether it is the 
almost low-?delity crunch that recalls the more visceral 
work of early Mountain Goats on “Amy aka Spent 
Gladiator 1,” or the propulsive upbeat bassline and horn 
lines of the album’s ?rst single “Cry for Judas,” which 
belies the hopelessness of the lyrics.
But the instrumentation’s function is really just as a 
complement to the voice. In this case, that’s totally 
?ne, because if you’re listening to an album made by 
the Mountain Goats, you’re listening in order to hear 
Darnielle’s singing.
And, boy, does Darnielle deliver. The singing is drenched 
in urgency, toeing the line between control and chaos 
that Darnielle has perfected. Without even taking the 
lyrics into consideration, Transcendental Youth is 
enjoyable to listen to, ?lled with both upbeat anthems 
seemingly crafted for long road trips and introspective, 
emotionally devastating monologues.
What makes this album so beautifully devastating, 
however, is the songwriting. Darnielle is an incredibly 
gifted lyricist who is capable of both vivid imagery 
(“When the men emerge with ri?es from the haystack 
/ Everybody looks surprised / Like the mice in the 
forgotten grain / Way up on the top shelf” on “Spent 
Gladiator 2”) and smart poetic wordplay (“Dream of 
maybe waking up someday / And wanting you less than 
I do / This is a dream though / It’s never gonna come 
true” on “Night Light”).
The album is loosely themed on self-destruction and the 
constant struggle for salvation and hope. While an album 
from a more self-conscious band may have been overly 
trite, the pure ferocity with which the band delivers 
its sound makes empathizing with the characters in 
Transcendental Youth a near inevitability. It is the band’s 
ability to provoke empathy that allows the Mountain 
Goats to continue creating such brilliance release after 
release. For listeners who have become jaded by a music 
industry consumed with irony and self-awareness, 
Transcendental Youth is a welcome beacon of raw, 
controlled power.

PSO gets creative with stunning Mozart rendition
Orchestra reinterprets familiar classic, showcases own concertmaster as soloist
It’s fair to say that people have come to expect 
excellence from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
(PSO). Between the orchestra’s international renown 
and its ability to consistently snatch world-class guest 
soloists for its performances, impressive concerts have 
become the norm for this musical gem in the heart of the 
Cultural District. But the PSO’s performance on Friday 
night featured the typically extraordinary orchestra at its 
very best.
While the PSO has no trouble bringing high-pro?le guest 
soloists to Heinz Hall, this time the orchestra chose to 
showcase its own talent: Concertmaster Noah Bendix-
Balgley took the stage as solo violinist with a sweetly 
passionate rendition of Beethoven’s Concerto in D minor 
for Violin and Orchestra.
With its rapid, sweeping pace and almost unintelligibly 
fast successions of notes, the concerto is clearly not 
designed for the technically faint at heart. Bendix-
Balgley not only gave an impeccable performance but 
supplemented it with his clean, pure stylistic voice.
After a warm introduction by the orchestra, Bendix-
Balgley made his entrance with a series of sweet, 
climbing octaves. The high ethereal notes tumbled off 
the strings; the soloist’s ?ngers barely seemed to graze 
the ?ngerboard as they moved. Bendix-Balgley displayed 
exceptional grace and precision, even for a musician of 
his caliber.
As well as a sensitive and accomplished soloist, Bendix-
Balgley proved himself a capable and daring composer. 
He wrote original cadenzas (guitar solos of sorts for the 
classical musician) and played them passionately — 
maintaining the sweet, sweeping melody of the piece 
while incorporating his own musical signature. Bendix-
Balgley’s efforts earned him a wild standing ovation at 
the end of his performance. 
While it seemed unbelievable that the second part of 
the program could live up to the ?rst, the orchestra’s 
performance of a reworked Mozart Requiem was equally 
impressive. 
The PSO’s rendition of the Requiem was all about 
ambience. Before the performance even began, the 
lights dimmed, and to the soft, chilling sound of a death 
bell, the audience read about the piece’s background on 
screens at the front of both sides of the hall.
Even when the musicians raised their instruments, 
and the members of the accompanying Mendelssohn 
Choir of Pittsburgh rose from their seats, the Requiem 
was not played straight through. Interspersed between 
movements were other death-related works by Mozart 
and a few haunting Gregorian chants that offset 
the majestic piece with a quiet, chilling hum. The 
performance also featured readings by award-winning 
actor F. Murray Abraham, famed for his role as Salieri in 
Amadeus.
This collection of works, though somewhat eclectic, 
had the beautiful effect of drawing new meaning from 
centuries-old classics. The program emphasized how 
death, while a common and ubiquitous occurrence in 
Mozart’s time, is today a source of fear and uncertainty. 
This context lent a grave air to the performance and 
allowed the audience to absorb familiar music with a 
new perspective.
This kind of creative programming — reworking a 
familiar classic in an engaging and thought-provoking 
way — is something that the orchestra frequently 
pulls off with huge success. With this combination of 
creativity, a talented soloist, and a fantastic orchestra, 
the evening was among the best in the PSO’s recent 
history.

A lot of people are going to hate The Casual Vacancy. 
J.K. Rowling’s ?rst novel for adults is bleak, dry, and 
decidedly without magic. But it’s also powerful, and 
to anyone with a stomach for sordidness, it has the 
potential to be a rewarding read.
The Casual Vacancy tells the story of Pagford — a small, 
well-to-do British town that has been saddled with an 
impoverished housing development called the Fields 
for 60 years. Many Pagford residents would like nothing 
more than to hand the Fields over to the neighboring city 
of Yarvil, and when parish councilor and Fields advocate 
Barry Fairbrother dies suddenly, leaving council 
members with the titular “casual vacancy,” they see their 
chance. A decades-old game of tug-of-war comes to a 
head, with 16-year-old Fields resident Krystal Weedon as 
the rope.
Rowling’s prose is workman-like. She has always over-
relied on adjectives and adverbs, and her attempts at 
?gurative language are generally awkward. For example, 
the aneurysm that kills Fairbrother “sliced through his 
brain like a demolition ball,” which isn’t very evocative 
and doesn’t make much sense — do demolition balls 
really slice? But her attention to detail and her intricate 
characters make up for that.
Rowling’s characters, be they heroes or villains, shine. 
They are detailed and recognizable: Narrow-minded, 
doting housewife Shirley Mollison regularly checks her 
“favorite medical website” to diagnose her neighbors. 
Apathetic, uptight Gavin Hughes, one of Fairbrother’s 
pallbearers, can’t stand that the wicker cof?n puts him 
so close to the dead body. Council candidate Miles 
Mollison, who witnessed Fairbrother’s death, just wants 
people to recognize that he’s an important player, too.
But Weedon, with her multiple piercings and exposed 
thong, is the real thematic heart of the book. Weedon is 
tough, vulnerable, and entirely alone in the world. She 
curses like a sailor and outwardly scoffs at society, but 
she secretly dreams that her older half-sister Anne-
Marie, whom she’s never met, will be her friend. She 
carries her little brother Robbie’s picture in a red, plastic 
heart keychain in her pocket. She stows her rowing 
medal — one of the few awards she’s ever gotten from 
Pagford — in the only safe, treasured place she has: 
a plastic jewelry box in her otherwise barren room. 
Weedon is a girl half-in and half-out of her community; 
she’s not wanted and knows it, but she can’t help but 
want to be part of it anyway.
The places where the book suffers are those where 
Rowling has tried the hardest to get away from her 
reputation as the author of the Harry Potter series. 
There’s a lot of sex and a lot of swearing, and while those 
aren’t bad in and of themselves, the book sometimes 
reads like South Park. That doesn’t seem to be what 
Rowling was going for.
But when she gets it right, Rowling’s new adult material 
injects a level of realism that wasn’t possible in Harry 
Potter. For example, social worker Kay Bawden recalls 
the many horrors she’s seen during her time working for 
Child Protective Services: “... and once (she dreamed of 
it, still), a child who had been locked in a cupboard for 
?ve days by his psychotic stepfather. That one had made 
the national news.” That’s a pretty bold step away from 
Harry Potter — in a dark direction.
Although Rowling’s book is bleak, there’s humor for 
those who are willing to look for it. Rowling has always 
been better at building worlds and observing people 
than she has been at constructing plots; she’s in her 
wheelhouse here, writing about a huge cast of sharply 
observed characters in a well-de?ned world. Instead 
of choosing one point of view, she narrates her story 
in a broad, omniscient voice, and it suits her — letting 
her play all her characters’ thoughts off each other and 
explore the little ironies, tragedies, and pettinesses of 
her cast. It is dif?cult not to laugh when sex-starved 
housewife Mollison breathes a sigh of relief when 
she discovers that, although she and her 14-year-old 
daughter both have crushes on members of an American 
boy band, they’re at least on different members. Never 
let it be said that Rowling doesn’t know the power of a 
good detail.
Mostly, though, The Casual Vacancy is a depressing 
book. The characters are, by and large, both unhappy 
and unlikeable. Their spots of hope are small and 
fragile; they are preoccupied with themselves and with 
their own troubles. The majority of what was good in 
their lives seems to have come from Fairbrother, who, 
as it gradually becomes clear, was the best person in 
Pagford. Rowling’s details work the other way as well, 
highlighting tragedies large and small in her characters’ 
lives, making gut-wrenching scenes of moments that 
otherwise might have been merely sad.
But there is a purpose to Rowling’s bleakness, and a 
strategy behind the unlikeability of her characters. 
Rowling’s book has one central theme that she hammers 
home: the desire of those comfortable with their lives to 
turn their backs on those who are af?icted. The heroes 
of the book — and there are very few of them — are 
the people who eventually manage to look away from 
their own lives and troubles and see value in the people 
around them. Meanwhile, the real villains of the story are 
not the people trying to oust the Fields; they are the ones 
who see what’s happening, and think, “I just can’t be 
bothered with local politics.”
The Casual Vacancy is a dif?cult book. It’s long, it’s sad, 
and there are precious few likeable characters. It’s a 
tragedy. But if you like tragedies, if your sense of humor 
runs to the dry, and if you are, like Rowling, constantly 
amazed by people’s willingness to avert their eyes — 
read it.

The National Endowment for the Arts’ 2009 report 
“Reading on the Rise” said that 47 percent of adults 
read at least one work of ?ction in 2008. Not even half of 
America made it through a single short story that year, 
and that statistic is considered an improvement.
But we do read. We spend our time online: watching 
videos, browsing photos, and reading text online. From 
Facebook statuses to online news to our favorite nearly 
pornographic e-book, we are probably reading more 
words than ever; they simply aren’t coming from literary 
classics or the nation’s poet laureate. And if anything, 
the last decade has shown that we can collectively come 
together and read, from community-based big reads 
and one-book projects to the thermonuclear success of a 
single boy wizard.
None of this is wrong: Reading and writing — online or 
not — and developing tastes are important, even if these 
tastes are shared with our 450 million closest friends. But 
for voracious readers, there is a constant goal to expand 
one’s oeuvre, to ?nd something new. So it’s worth a 
look when, each year in autumn, the Swedish Academy 
places the Nobel crown on the head of their most 
recently glori?ed author.
This year, the prize went to Mo Yan, a Chinese ?ction 
writer who is probably utterly unknown to most 
American readers. His work, unlike much contemporary 
Chinese ?ction, has been translated into English, largely 
because of Howard Goldblatt’s more than two decades 
of translating Chinese writers. Because of this, you could 
start reading one of Mo’s books now. Seriously, don’t let 
the rest of this article get in your way. Start with Red 
Sorghum or Life and Death are Wearing Me Out. You can 
even get the latter on your Kindle or e-reader of choice.
Many people have had their views of the Nobel Prize 
handed to them wholesale by the media, and think that 
these prizes are simply political gestures. Particularly 
resentful Americans believe that the Swedish 
Academy’s stubbornness to reward the best of our own 
country’s writers means it should be ignored. Politics 
are certainly at work in these awards, but the Academy 
still manages to select writers of ?ction that is absolutely 
worth reading. The 2008 laureate Jean-Marie Gustave Le 
Clézio’s stories are terrifyingly depressing. Doris Lessing, 
winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, de?ned 
whole genres. John M. Coetzee, the 2003 laureate, is one 
of our best living writers.
Politics are obviously involved. China can now proudly 
claim a Nobel Prize and at the same time happily 
continue pretending that the prizes its nationals won in 
2000 and 2010 never happened. Arguably, Mo deserves 
the award for that alone: He has managed to successfully 
write oft-satirical novels, which are widely banned; has 
gained global acclaim; and yet remains in good standing 
with the Chinese government.
For example, take The Republic of Wine — an 
engrossing novel that rotates between detective Ding 
Gou’er and the short stories of Li Yidou. Between the 
fantastical elements of investigating baby cannibalism, 
audacious displays of government corruption and 
debauchery, and the uneven talents of a young writer, 
Mo is able to guide us through a tour of food and drink in 
China. Right from the lady trucker opening, Mo proves 
that he can spin a tale that delights, while providing a 
greater social commentary.
But consider these literary awards as recommendations 
from some very well-read friends. You may now go read 
Mo’s work, or, if you are a holdout, peruse the National 
Book Award ?nalists or wait until the Man Booker Prize 
is announced tomorrow. Awards will keep coming, the 
books will keep piling up: Read one.

Reel Q Film Festival kicks off this week
The Pittsburgh Lesbian and Gay Film Society presents a week-long series of LGBT cinema
Pittsburgh’s vibrant ?lm community blossoms in the fall 
as the city plays host to a series of unique opportunities 
for cinephiles. This week marks the beginning of a great 
season for ?lm as the Pittsburgh Lesbian and Gay Film 
Society presents the Reel Q LGBT Film Festival. Just 
on the heels of National Coming Out Day, Downtown’s 
Harris Theater will be showing exclusive programs of the 
latest and most vital work in LGBT cinema this week. 
There are a number of ?lms to choose from, and this 
might be your only chance to see them.
Monday and Tuesday
Monday and Tuesday evening’s programs are made up 
of collected short ?lms, with women’s pictures showing 
on Monday and men’s on Tuesday. The women’s 
program features six different ?lms, including a musical, 
a period piece, and a celebrated work from Japan. During 
the men’s program, ?lmmakers from Canada, Australia, 
Germany, Spain, France, and the U.S. will be represented 
in nine different shorts.
Wednesday
Wednesday night will be the Pittsburgh premiere of 
Mary Lou, a ?lm that has been described as an Israeli 
spin on Glee. A young gay man sets out for Tel Aviv to 
?nd his mother, whom he claims left him to become a 
backup singer for the famous Svika Pick. Mary Lou will 
be presented with English subtitles.
Friday
Following another evening of short ?lms on Thursday, 
Friday’s program is dynamite. The celebrated British 
work Stud Life will play at 7 p.m. It features one of the 
most applauded performances in recent LGBT cinema 
from T’nia Miller. Stud Life will be followed by the new 
biographical movie Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of 
James Dean at 9:30 p.m. James Dean, one of the most 
legendary ?gures in American culture, has always 
seemed elusive, but in focusing on the period just before 
his launch to fame, actor James Preston illuminates his 
con?icted, closeted youth.
The true beauty of Reel Q is the opportunity it affords. 
LGBT cinema is, unfortunately, still well outside the 
mainstream. However, these ?lms don’t aspire to play 
in multiplexes, and they use that to their advantage. 
They’re ?lms you won’t be able to see anywhere else, 
and they deal passionately and ?rmly with the most 
contested social issue in America. Reel Q gives us the 
chance to see these pictures the way they’re meant to 
be seen — as a social event. Many of these ?lms may 
never ?nd distribution outside the internet, so take some 
time this week to support a vibrant community and a 
growing slice of ?lm culture.

While I was watching the Cooking Channel a few weeks 
ago, an advertisement came on for Maruchan Ramen 
Noodles that showed a white, suburban, middle-
class family happily enjoying prepackaged noodle 
products together. I rolled my eyes; with the family’s 
over-enthusiastic responses to ramen aside, it seemed 
unlikely that that family represented Maruchan’s 
main customer base. At a mere 40 cents a package at 
Giant Eagle, ramen noodles are best known for being a 
standard staple of any broke (or kitchen-fearing) college 
student’s diet, eaten more out of necessity than out of 
genuine enjoyment.
The commercial got me thinking, though, about ramen 
noodles’ culinary potential. While the noodles and 
accompanying ?avor packets may be unexciting on 
their own, they are straightforward enough to serve as 
excellent building blocks for other recipes that are more 
nutritious and interesting.
My culinary accomplice, Xuexia Jiang, and I thus set out 
to use ramen in as wide of a variety of meals as possible, 
and we found that ramen noodles can be incorporated 
into plenty of different recipes for every meal. There are 
literally hundreds of recipes on the internet involving 
ramen noodles, but our sampling of ramen-related 
culinary experiments proves that the noodles can 
be consumed for any meal and taste delicious in the 
process.
Ramen Egg Scramble
Ramen for breakfast sounds suspect, but the noodles 
work surprisingly well in this dish. Since ramen noodles 
are fairly ?avorless on their own and have a nondescript 
texture, they make for a good, ?lling ingredient. In this 
recipe, for instance, one can turn three eggs and a 
handful of vegetables and cheese into a ?lling dish that 
can easily satisfy two people.
Recipe
Adapted from indochinekitchen.com
1/2 pack chicken-?avored instant ramen noodles
1 tbsp butter
2 tbsp onion, ?nely chopped
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (or any other vegetables 
of your choice)
3 eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons of water and a pinch 
of salt
1/4 cup cheese
Salsa
Drop half of the package of ramen noodles into boiling 
water. Cook for four minutes, or according to package 
instructions.
Drain water and toss in instant powdered stock included 
in the package. Mix well with a fork.
Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Quickly cook 
chopped onions for two minutes, or until they are 
translucent. Add cherry tomatoes (or other vegetables) 
and cook for another minute.
Add noodles into the pan and mix well with the other 
ingredients. Cook for another two minutes.
Spread noodles and tomatoes evenly across the pan. Add 
egg mixture and cook for one minute.
Add cheese on top, turn down heat slightly, and cook for 
approximately three more minutes, stirring occasionally.
Top with salsa and serve.
Ramen Skillet Pizza
This recipe is not a perfect replica of pizza. If you have a 
craving and the only cure is pizza, this dish probably will 
not suf?ce, as it still tastes like noodles rather than pizza 
crust.
However, if you’re just in need of some carbs drowned in 
sauce and cheese, ramen pizza can get the job done. The 
noodles take on a nice grilled ?avor when cooked in the 
pan, and the more toppings you add, the easier it is to 
forget that the “crust” is actually just 80 cents’ worth of 
Japanese noodles.

                  Anna Walsh | Personnel Manager
by Anna Walsh | Personnel Manager[]
Recipe
Adapted from womansday.com
2 packages ramen, any ?avor
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup spaghetti sauce (adjust as desired)
4 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 tsp dried oregano, crumbled
Other pizza toppings, as desired
Heat broiler. Bring water to boil in a large pot.
Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, for three 
minutes or until tender. Drain in a colander.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. When hot, add noodles 
and press evenly to cover bottom of pan. Cook on 
medium-high heat for four minutes or until browned 
underneath.
Spread sauce over noodles, then sprinkle with cheese, 
oregano, and other toppings.
If the skillet handle is plastic or wood, wrap it in a double 
layer of foil to protect it from scorching. Broil four to ?ve 
inches from heat source for two minutes, or until top is 
bubbly and cheese starts to brown.
Let cool about ?ve minutes before cutting to serve.
Ramen Stir Fry
Stir fry is a very ?exible and easy dish. You can buy 
frozen packages of premixed stir fry vegetables, or you 
can just use whatever combination of vegetables and 
meat you happen to have on hand.
Recipe
1 package of Oriental-?avored ramen noodles
Cooking oil (olive, vegetable, or canola all work)
Soy sauce
Assorted vegetables for stir fry
Pour a small amount of oil onto the bottom of a frying pan 
or wok and heat pan.
Add vegetables and fry; cook off most of the water.
At the same time, boil a pot of water. Add ramen and 
boil until noodles are pliable.
Place ramen noodles into the same pan as vegetables 
and add a dash of soy sauce, the package of Oriental 
seasoning, and a little more oil.
Stir brie?y, then take off heat. Add salt and pepper.
Chocolate Peanut Butter Munchies
Ramen noodles for dessert sounds even more doubtful 
than ramen for breakfast does. However, the uncooked 
noodles in this recipe work as a crunchy complement 
to peanut butter and chocolate. If you’re craving some 
peanut butter and chocolate and don’t want to just eat 
peanut butter and chocolate syrup straight off a spoon, 
this is a surprisingly tasty way to satisfy your craving.
Recipe
Adapted from budget101.com
1 pack instant ramen noodles, any ?avor
1 1/2 cups chocolate (chocolate chips, Hershey’s bars, 
etc.)
1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate in 
30-second intervals until melted, stirring in between.
Stir in peanut butter with melted chocolate.
Carefully break uncooked ramen into bite-sized chunks. 
Be careful not to crumble noodles.
Spread chocolate peanut butter mix over each of the 
noodle chunks, covering each well.
Refrigerate for 10 minutes, or until chocolate mix has 
completely hardened.
Editor’s Note: Junior staffwriter Xuexia Jiang contributed 
to this article.

As part of the Carol Brown Lecture Series, Gordon 
Hutner spoke last Thursday in Rangos Hall on 
“Writing the Literary History of the 21st Century: A 
Brief Introduction.” Hutner, a professor of American 
literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, has been widely published in the ?eld 
of literary history and is the founding editor of the 
journal American Literary History.
Hutner’s most recent book, titled What America 
Read: Taste, Class and the Novel 1920 – 1960, 
examines how the literary works remembered by 
academia may not be the ones that were most 
pertinent to the general reading public. The novels 
that were forgotten were those that pertained mostly 
to middle-class values — novels that he described as 
“literature not of the great, but of the pretty good.” 
Hutner said the “critical memory” of academia is 
assigning less value to “middle-brow” works, and 
instead favoring bourgeois values. This work led 
Hutner to consider the current literary climate.
Hutner means to create a system of reviewing novels 
that avoids the mistakes of previous generations of 
academics. It was intimidating for him to decide 
how to start. Initially, he considered doing close 
readings of a handful of key novels, but decided that 
this method would not be representative enough of 
the century as a whole.
Instead, he gathered prize-winning novels — 
works that had already earned accolades and had 
value according to the prize panels. The idea of 
this method provoked murmurs of assent from 
the audience. However, he discovered that the 
panels were almost exclusively comprised of other 
novelists. He wittily described it as “pigs giving 
reviews about bacon.” But this realization led him to 
wonder why there aren’t more academics involved 
in evaluating literature.
The most interesting part of Hutner’s lecture was his 
response to the problem, “Who is paying attention?” 
He argued that there is a lack of literary criticism, 
which is replaced by reviews in newspapers and 
magazines. Hutner speculates that this lack of 
criticism results from the shrinking of print culture, 
the close relationships between book publishers and 
reviewers, and the fact that the spirit of argument 
has been replaced with the habit of praising the 
strong and ignoring the weak. His focus on the 
evolution of literary reviews gave context and lent 
interest to his topic.
Hutner recommended that academics get back 
into the criticism game to alleviate this issue. 
English professors need to read modern works 
and evaluate them seriously in order to create a 
true history of the 21st-century novel — one that 
is more representative of the works being written 
as a whole and those that are more relevant to the 
readers of the time period. During the Q & A after 
the lecture, there was some debate as to whether 
or not professors can be expected to do this. Hutner 
said that it should be included in the job description, 
and while this answer may not have convinced the 
questioner, it reinforced Hutner’s position.
Hutner realizes that his solution is not foolproof, 
and acknowledged that the books that stand up to 
the test of time may be the ones by “less heralded” 
authors, or even “books I haven’t heard of yet.” The 
goal of Hutner’s project is a noble one, and addresses 
the need for a more complete literary history of the 
novels that address the problems of the time, be they 
middle-class ethics, race and gender issues, or other 
everyday topics. He presented his ideas in a fashion 
that was both engaging and informative, bringing 
life to the subject. There are many works worth 
preserving, and the consensus in the room was that 
there needs to be action to make that happen.
