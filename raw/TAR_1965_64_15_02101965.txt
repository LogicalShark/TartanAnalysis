Committee To Review President Stever To Deliver 
Changes In Calendar First Speech To Student Body
(1c
by Candy Etkin
An ad hoc calendar committee, headed by Mr. Robert J. 
ibbee, vice-president for academic affairs, will begin inves­
tigating the possibility of a change in Carnegie Tech’s calen­
dar on February 18. ?------------------------------------------------
Originally suggested by former 
President John C. Warner, t h e 
committee will examine various 
calendars. This study is a result 
of diverse opinion expressed in 
the recent calendar survey by 
faculty and students at the mo­
tion by Student Congress to adopt 
|£he Penn B calendar.
Among the possibilities which 
will be discussed are the tri­
mester system, the term system, 
the quarter system, and the Penn 
B calendar.
“The thing is to find out ex­
actly what is desirable and what 
is not desirable,” stated Mr. Kib- 
bee. “The committee will be con­
cerned with such things as the 
kinds of breaks and vacation, the 
.,questions of a reading period be­
fore examinations, and the eco­
nomic effect of each calendar.”
The committee proposes to seek 
the opinions of any deans, fac­
ulty members, and students. They 
will also request opinions from 
representatives of large groups 
such as Student Congress. In ad­
dition, the committee will consult 
pertinant educational literature 
and make inquiries to schools 
using the various calendars.
Cf Assisted by George K. Brown, 
dean of student affairs, Mr. Kib- 
bees committee will consist ' of 
eight deans and faculty members.
Following the suggestion of Pres­
ident Horton Guyford Stever, a 
student, Vernon Leicht, junior,
Chemical Engineering, will also 
serve the committee.
The findings of the ad hoc com­
mittee will be reported to the 
Faculty Administration Commit­
tee who will make the final de­
cision.
Rush To Last 
Thru Saturday
Formal fraternity rush will 
continue through this Saturday.
Dinners will be served for the 
^rushees at the fraternity houses 
tonight and tomorrow evening, 
from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m.
The fraternities will sponsor 
open parties Saturday night, from 
8:30 p.m. until 1 a.m.
Bids will first be accepted on 
Monday at 5 p.m. Open rush will 
prevail after 7:30 p.m. Monday.
Tech Sponsors 
History Project
A new project, instituted by 
Carnegie Tech, will be aimed at 
helping predominantly Negro col­
leges improve their teaching of 
American history.
The project will be supported 
by a grant of $36,600 from the 
Carnegie Corporation of New 
York. It will be directed by Da­
vid H. Fowler, assistant profes­
sor of history in the Division of 
Humanities and Social Sciences. 
He will be assisted by Seymour 
J. Mandelbaum, assistant profes­
sor of history at Carnegie Tech, 
and two teachers who attended 
a seven-week seminar conducted 
on the campus last summer.
Work on the project begins 
in February and will be com­
pleted next summer. The pro­
grams formulated in the project 
will be tested by cooperating col­
lege teachers in the year 1965- 
1966.
First TGIF
The Student Union Committee 
announced that the semester’s first 
TGIF will be held this Friday in 
the Skibo snack bar from 4:30 to 
6:00.
The Sounds, a five piece combo, 
will provide the music.

duce provocative questions which 
stimulate thinking on a more 
sophisticated level than that one to 
which a high school senior is ac­
customed, and, second, it should 
provide a casual atmosphere in 
which the freshmen can meet peo­

A notice concerning Freshman 
Camp counselor positions will ap­
pear in the Tartan in three to four

The program will include 
“Quick March-Sea Songs” by 
Ralph Vaugham Williams; “Sym­
phony No. 6 Band” by Vincent 
Persichetti; “Introduction, Theme, 
and Variations rt>r Euphonium 
Solo” by Philip Cotalinet (played 
by Barry Oatelinet, Euphonium, 
and conducted by Philip Cateli- 
net); “Dionysioques” by Florent 
Schmitt; “Suiee Française” by 
Darius Milhaud (Dr. Maurice I. 
Laney, conducting); and “Three 
Chorale Preludes” by William 
Latham.
Last weekend the band com­
pleted a 3 day tour, the highlight 
of which was a concert in Buf­
falo before 1200 members of the 
Music Educators National Confer­
ence. That program was opened 
by the New England Conservatory 
Orchestra. The Kiltie Band com­
pleted the concert with the first 
four works on Saturdany’s pro­
gram. Both the orchestra and the 
band received standing ovations.
After the Buffalo concert a Po­
lish composer, who has twice 
heard the Dionysiaques played by 
the famed Garde Républicaine 
Band of Paris, commented to Dr. 
Strange that the Kiltie Band per­
formance was outstanding, and 
that the Kiltie brass section 
sounded better than that of the 
Garde Républicaine Band.

Dr. Horton Guyford Stever, 
who assumed the presidency 
of Carnegie Tech on February 
1, will deliver his first major 
speech to the student body in 
the gym on February 16 at 
11:30 a.m.
Joe Sandulli, chairman of Stu­
dent Congress, will introduce the 
president.
See Editorial, Page 4
In discussing the content of his 
speech, Dr. Stever explained that 
it will include topics suggested by 
faculty, administration, interested 
trustees, alumni, and community 
leaders. He will also include topics 
from letters by students expres­
sing their interests.
Dr. Stever will also use informa­
tion from a booklet on the goals of 
education, published by the Car­
negie Corporation of New York.

talk, Dr. Stever said. “Carnegie 
Tech is much too important for 
me to determine its future in six­
teen days.”

Editorials
Welcome, Dr. Stever
The Tartan extends its welcome to Dr. Horton Guyford 
Stever, succeeding Dr. Warner, as fifth president of Carnegie 
Tech.
Dr. Stever enters the presidency with an unusual back­
ground in educational, administrative and governmental af­
fairs. He holds a B.A. degree from Colgate University, a pre­
dominantly liberal arts school, and a Ph.D. in physics from 
California Institute of Technology.
Before assuming the presidency of Carnegie Tech, he 
was simultaneously head of three department at Massachu­
setts Institute of Technology.
We feel that Dr. Stever’s diverse background and wide 
range of experience make him ideally suited to cope with 
the problems existing today on the Carnegie Tech campus.
Former President Warner, in his final address before the 
students, which he delivered on December 7, outlined what 
he felt to be four major problems at Carnegie Tech.
(1) The school has increased the drudgery of learning 
without significantly adding to the excitement of learning.
(2) The interests of the students and faculty at Carnegie 
Tech are circumscribed too narrowly by their professional 
concerns.
(3) The faculty and administration “have not worked 
very assiduously at trying to understand the attitudes, values 
and expectations of the students,” as well as not fully and 
frankly explaining their own.
(4) More though must be given to the recreational activi­
ties on campus.
These present a strong challenge to the new president. 
But Dr. Stever’s idea on education, which he expressed in an 
interview conducted by the Tartan on December 10, make us 
believe that he can effectively deal with these problems.
Dr. Stever believes “strongly in the liberal-professional 
education Tech gives.” He feels that the only thing one has 
to spend as a student is time, and that one achieves a success­
ful education through the proper investment of time.
Apropos of the second problem outlined by former Pres­
ident Warner, Dr. Stever said, “the education process is not 
complete unless part of it is broad, and part of it is sufficient­
ly narrow.”
Dr. Stever is well aware of the need, which was pointed 
out by Dr. Warner, to understand the students, for he stated. 
“I like to see interaction at the student level.”
Finally, the new president has seen great value in extra­
curricular activities and athletics. He believes that extra-cur­
ricular activities help to achieve an interchange between stu­
dents; and athletics provide a means of relaxation. “Intra­
murals are fun because of their spontaneity; inter-collegiate 
sports are fun too because they have a little bit of polish 
about them.”
President Stever claimed that Carnegie Tech has “an 
excellent past and a bright future.”
We welcome Dr. Stever and offer our cooperation in 
helping to achieve higher goals for Carnegie Tech.
How Long Lucky?
During finals’ week there was an accident at the corner 
of Forbes and Morewood Avenues. As she crossed the street, 
a Carnegie Tech student was struck by an oncoming auto­
mobile. She was rushed to Shadyside Hospital with a con­
cussion and other serious injuries.
Most of us have been lucky. There have been few acci­
dents at the Forbes-Morewood crossing but the crossing is 
dangerous.
Of course, the pedestrians do not always cross with the 
lights. But even when they do, there is danger.
Action should be taken to minimize this danger.
Cars traveling along Forbes do not slow down as they do 
in other conjested areas. They turn the corners quickly as 
pedestrians cross the street.
About five years ago, the Pittsburgh Police had a patrol­
man stationed at the crossing during rush hours to regulate 
traffic. The cars did slow down, but after the 1960 student 
riots, this regular police coverage was discontinued. And the 
administration did nothing to restore it.
The administration casually considered the construction 
of a tunnel or overpass at the Forbes-Morewood site. The 
tunnel idea was discarded after a study of the dangers and 
engineering problems involved. Though final recommenda­
tions were made for an overpass, no further action was taken.
Now, in conjunction with the planning of the new admin­
istration building, the administration is studying the Forbes- 
Morewood traffic pattern. They plan to revise it.
The danger for pedestrians at the Forbes-Morewood 
crossing continues to exist. If immediate action is not taken, 
fewer of us will be lucky.

‘Tartan’ Receives Letters
The Carnegie Tech Tartan received the following letters
concerning Dr. Warner’s retirement:
“Dr. John Warner has my best wishes for the future 
and my congratulations in behalf of all Pennsylvanians, for 
his major contributions to education in the commonwealth. I 
join wholeheartedly in honoring him upon his retirement.”
Governor William W. Scranton
Professor Criticizes 
Discussions of Critique
Miss Verna Voltz and 
Mr. Dick Batchelder,
Campus YMCA and YWCA:
This letter is to tell you some of 
my impressions on the “Critique of 
the University” meetings which I 
attended this semester and to let . 
you know the reason why I decid- ** 
[ ed to discontinue my participation. 
First of all, I want to make 
clear that I believe that the con­
tacts between students and fac­
ulty at Carnegie Tech are not 
sufficiently frequent nor suffi­
ciently warm. They are un­
fortunately limited almost ex­
clusively to classroom contacts.
For my part, I have made an 
honest effort to increase contacts, 
with the students and have never 
refused to speak before any group 
or participate in any meeting to 
which I have been invited by 
them. However, I have often been 
disappointed by the attitude of the 
students and my experience with 
the “Critique of the University” 
has only added to this feeling.
Let me say a few words which 
could be entitled “Critique of the 
Student Body.” ^
It is my impression that the 
students are very little interest­
ed in extra-curricular intelectu- 
al activities.
Their attendance at meetings, 
lectures and discussions is always 
extremely scarce. We have had 
outstanding lecturers speaking to 
the regular Assembly, and others 
invited through the Falk lecture­
ships, Benjamin Fairless Memorial 
Lecture Series, etc.; there have gj 
been the Colloquia of Arts and 
Sciences and other meetings of 
general cultural interest.
At these events the greatest part 
of the audience has been formed 
by the faculty, their families, 
friends and professional people 
from around town, but the parti­
cipation of the students has al­
ways been small. The few times I

about non-scientific subjects, the 
attendance has also been very 
; limited.
At the “Critique of the Universi- 
| ty” most of the questions discuss­
ed had nothing to do with cultural 
I or intellectual life. The students 
I were naturally interested in their 
courses and were ready to criticize 
the way they are run. This, how­
ever, I believe, is not a subject 
which should be open to discus­
sion, since it is assumed that the 
students are here to learn and not 
to teach us the way to run our 
! courses.
Concerning extra-curricular ac­
tivities, the students expressed 
their opinion about practical mat­
ters which may be of interest to 
deans and other administrative 
| officials in charge of dormitories 
and of recreational facilities, but 
which are of no concern to the 
academic staff .Recently President Johnson gave his annual economic re- some students complained about1®'

“I should like to acknowledge the great esteem in which 
Dr. Warner is held throughout the communities of science, 
technology, education, and industry in this country. Forty 
years of teaching, of which nearly fifteen have been spent at 
the head of one of the nation’s finest engineering institutes, 
is a remarkable career by any standards.
On top of this, Dr. Warner has made notable direct con­
tributions to science and has served his several professions 
and his country in many capacities. His association with the 
national atomic energy program has been especially close, 
embracing his wartime efforts for the Manhattan District and 
his service on the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic 
Energy Commission.
Carnegie Tech has expanded and flowered under his 
wise leadership, and it seems to me that both the Institute 
and Dr. Warner can justly take great pride in each other.
I mave been delighted to learn that Dr. Warner will 
continue to use his great energy and experience on behalf of 
industry, and would wish for him the continuing rewards that 
go with challenge and opportunity.

American people three recessions 
in eight years.
Ike's passion to balance the 
budget at all costs and his be­
lief that deficits necessarily lead 
to inflation were the major 
causes of the recessions. 
Keynesian economies shows us 
that the federal deficits are not 
real deficits, if there is slack in the 
economy and if there are idle 
plants and workers. With unem­
ployment in the economy, the de­
ficits stimulate the economy and 
have a favorable effect upon it. 
This is the position our ecenomy 
is in today.
President Johnson seems to be 
neglecting a most important fac­
tor—the level of unemployment 
in the United States today. He 
points out that over 1,500,000 jobs 
were created in the past year. 
However, he fails to give any evi­
dence of this satement in his econ-
sion took place.
President Johnson also neglects 
the expansion of the labor force 
in his argument. Some observers 
think that the labor force ex­
pended by over a million persons 
in the past year, and predict that 
expansion in 1965 will be sub­
stantially greater. President John­
son’s statement about the state 
of the ecenomy are not too im­
pressive in light of this fact.
It seems as though President 
Johnson is neglecting the unem-
noise at late hours and to have 
uncontrolled fun.
I know, from personal experi­
ence, that the students have some 
very good reasons-for complain­
ing about the lack of political, 
freedom on the campus: a few4 
years ago, for instance, it was not 
possible to organize a student 
group of the Committee for a Sane 
Nuclear Policy because the Stu­
dent Council and some administra­
tive officer regarded it as con­
troversial. But this and similar 
questions were not raised at the 
“Critique of the University” meet­
ing.

English Instructor 
Proposes Traffic Change
Editor, the Tartan:
During the past month two Car­
negie Tech girls have been struck 
by cars while crossing the inter­
section at Forbes and Morewood. 
One girl was taken by ambulance 
to a local hospital; the other went 
by private car. Although I do not 
know the extent of their injuries, 
both girls could have been severe­
ly hurt.
Unless some corrective measures 
are put into effect, a tragedy may i 
occur some day at this location.
Several possibilities suggest 
themselves. A campus policeman 
could regulate the traffic at rush 
hours. Student volunteers could j 
take on this responsibility. Some 
form of overpass or underpass; 
might be arranged.
I propose that the Student Con­
gress consider this question and i 
come up with specific recommen­
dations in the near future.
Sincerely yours, 
William W. Cobau 
Instructor in English 
(See editorial, page 4,
How Long Lucky? and photo, 
page 2, ed.)
may very well become a dangerous 
one. Before long, piofessors would 
be walking around campus in­
cased in bandages, which in turn ; 
incase pencil stab w’ounds. This 
too, is unhealthy.
But aside from the health 
hazard, a dull pencil makes 
most homework problems un- j 
readable. This is a fine way to 
fool homework checkers and 
w’ould be impossible with a good 
point.
Of course, there are also 
those who would love to possess a 
sharpened pencil. Some, in their 
great desire, wearily walk all the j 
way to Hunt Library, pencils in 
hand. But what happens after 
they have finally reached their! 
destination and begin to turn the 
crank? Fifty people look up 
angrily and menacingly from their 
work, ready to stab the poor soul 
at the sharpener, if only they had 
a sharp pencil.
We, the students of Carnegie 
Tech, must unite, as did our col- 
leages in California, and make 
known to the administration our 
great need. We want a sharpener 
in every classroom and a sharp 
pencil in every pocket and purse.

2 Pharmacies 
Just Reopened
Woodlawn and Morrowfield 
Pharmacies, both owned by Fred 
Miller, of Bartlett Street, Squirrel j 
Hill, have reopened this se­

The Morrowfield Pharmacy, 
Forward Avenue, Squirrel Hill, 
suffered an estimated $30,000 
damage during a Christmas week 
fire. The November Woodlawn 
blaze was reported in the Tartan 
on November 18.
According to Mr. Miller, who 
recently returned from a two-

lawn has been re-modeled into 
a double horseshoe, and extra 
cooking facilities have been add­
ed.
Morrowfield will be completely

An Important Point
Editor, the Tartan:
Carnegie Tech is known 
throughout the country as a good 
school, but it has one major failure 
to its credit. It lacks pencil sharp­
eners. A student just cannot go 
through four years of Tech with a 
dull pencil in his pocket.
Ah, but there will be those who 
say that a dull point is a good 
thing. If one carries around a 
sharp pencil he has a tendency to 
stab himself, and this is un­
healthy. Also, a Tech student is 
often a frustrated one, and with 
a pointed pencil in his pocket he

PUNmHED &APE IS &OO SLOW FOR US
Punched tape used to be considered 
“speedy”—and fast enough to collect 
and store business data sent over com­
munications lines.
No more. Because a new “duobinary 
coding system" developed by our sub­
sidiary, Lenkurt Electric, doubles the 
rate (or halves the time) at which data
can be transmitted ... up to 2400 "bits" 
per second. So fast that magnetic com­
puter tape must be used to keep pace 
with the new system.
Progress in data transmission is but 
one of many advances that GT&E has 
contributed to the fields of communica­
tions, electronics, automation, lighting
and national defense. It serves to explain 
why GT&E is one of America’s foremost 
companies in terms of dollar sales, rev­
enues, and diversity of products.
As a young, aggressive company with 
no limit to its growth, GT&E is an enter­
prise you may wish to think of in terms of your own future.GEEGENERALTELEPHONE & ELECTRONICS

transformers, Pennsylvania now has over thirty 
500-kv units in operation or on order.
As a member of the McGraw-Edison group, 
Pennsylvania Transformer has behind it the 
financial strength and stability of a major, 
diversified corporation. Among the well-known 
trademarks of McGraw-Edison are Toast­
master, Edison, Lectromelt, Manning-Bow- 
man, Buss fuses and Speed Queen.
But, along with this, Pennsylvania Trans­
former is an autonomous operation, where 
decisions are made locally by aggressive young 
management. This means that, while you have 
the profit-sharing plan of a major corporation, 
you work, gain recognition, and advance as an 
individual.
We’re not big enough to smother each project 
in depth with engineers—that’s why we want 
the best.
If you can appreciate the opportunity this 
environment offers—not only now but ten 
years from now—we’d like to talk with you. 
Specifically, we’d like to talk about design, 
development, application and manufacturing 
engineering; and technical sales. We’ll be on

electrical or mechanical engineering or other 
technical majors—men with both confidence 
and ability—will read this message through, 
and then act. We’re looking for those men.
Pennsylvania Transformer is a division of 
McGraw-Edison Company, located in Canons-

is an autonomous member of the more than 
forty divisions which comprise the diversified 
McGraw-Edison family.
Pennsylvania Transformer was a highly suc­

the electric utility industry prior to its acquisi­
tion by McGraw-Edison in 1952. Its success 
was based on solid product leadership.
In the past several years, PT has expanded 
into a major producer of electrical equipment. 
Entry into new markets, including extra-high 
voltage transmission, assures a sound base for 
this expansion.
Pennsylvania produces a complete line of dis­
tribution transformers and regulators, medium- 
and high-voltage switchgear, and power trans­
formers. One of the earliest producers of EHV

On many a Friday night, the Wherrett Room of Skibo

Ceilidh holds its meetings from*'
9 to 12 p.m. here at Carnegie Tech 
or at Pitt or Duquesne. Schedules

.Organized four years ago by Dr. 
Howard Glasser, assistant profes­
sor of Graphic Arts, Ceilidh has 
no formal membership. In Dr. 
Glasser’s words, students, “are 
members when they cross the 
threshhold. If they have the cour­
age, they are welcome to sing or 
play anything they wish — Blue- 
grass, mountain music, Scottish 
ballads, etc.”
It is estimated that there is an 
average of seventy-five people at

need to express themselves 
through music.” He felt that this 
need should be encouraged in an 
era when people have lost the 
knack of entertaining themselves.
Sundays on WRCT from 4 to 6 
p.m., Dr. Glasser maintains his 
interest in folk music with Jane 
Snyder, freshman P&D, on a 
radio program which, “concen­
trates on the mere traditional 
music.”

The word, Ceilidh, is Scottish

In an era where the frontiers of intellectual endeavor demand constant investigation, imagination must be the crux of 
motivation.
The research laboratories at the National Security Agency exemplify that rare activity where imagination and a 
look at the possibilities of tomorrow are the accepted philosophy. A glance inside these modern, well equipped labora­
tories would reveal project teams engaged in a broad spectrum of scientific investigations.
Among them . . .
MAJOR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS DEVELOP- 
MENT—Design of new antennas, transmitters, receivers 
and terminal equipment. Constructing preliminary and 
basic engineering models to demonstrate the feasibility of 
using new communications concepts, techniques and cir­
cuits. Adapting and perfecting these through the design 
of a working prototype or field test model.
COMPONENT MINIATURIZATION STUDIES —
Practical attempts, through basic design and analysis, to 
reduce the size yet improve the capability of communica­
tions and electronic data processing systems.
SYSTEMS SIMULATION STUDIES—Utilization of 
modern digital and analog computers to predict the feasi­
bility of engineering ideas and innovations.
MATHEMATICAL INVESTIGATIONS—Exploring the 
phenomena of the intermarriage of mathematics and elec­
tronics in the design of secure communications systems; 
an essential element of the complex science of cryptology. 
ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING—Proving the capabili­
ties of components and systems by simulating atmospheric
extremes. These tests are conducted with the latest equip­
ment capable of simulating a wide variety of environmen­
tal conditions.
For the ENGINEER and the MATHEMATICIAN, NSA 
provides a unique variety of opportunities in a NEW di­
mension in science and technology ... To assure the suc­
cess of this venture, scientific employees are encouraged

BY 0. L SmHOEFFLER, ESQUIRE’S Fashion Director
&HE FABRIm S&ORY for 1965 is only slightly less engrossing than 
the heroic exploits of Secret Agent 007. And chances are, its impact 
will be felt long after James Bond takes his place beside Tarzan 
as one of the great folk heroes of our time. As s-t-r-e-t-c-h fabrics 
begin to spread to the limits of the fashion horizon, it’s high time 
we filled you in on the significance—particularly on the campus 
scene—of this exciting fashion innovation.
INS&AN& Am&ION is what daredevil ski slopes
call for. And the demand for instant action ski 
pants a few years ago spurred on the quest for 
a lightweight, flexible fabric. The outcome was 
the discovery of stretch fabrics. In keeping with 
the spirit of the modern approach, manufac­
turers used expandable fibers to create trim, 
lightweight slacks in wool and cotton polyester 
blends. The wind-resistant comfort and ease of 
the resultant ski wear was bound to carry over 
into other items of men’s apparel. Thus, the 
fashion industry moved in to adopt and adapt 
stretch fabrics from their primary, functional 
uses in ski jackets, parkas and pants. And thus 
occurred the exciting breakthrough that is just 
beginning to permeate the fashion industry.
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY let’s take a sneak preview of the up-coming
infiltration of stretch fabrics on the campus scene. This trend is 
very much at its inception on campus; many college men know 
nothing about it. However, for you forward-thinking, fashion­
conscious men, here’s the scoop. The Natural Shoulder silhouette, 
which continues to be the outstanding favorite, is about to be hit by 
the stretch invasion. The all-over ease and casual elegance of the 
Natural Shoulder blends perfectly with the easy-fitting flexibility 
of stretch fibers. Jackets continue to be cut on straight-hanging 
lines with center vents, flapped pockets, and narrow, medium length 
lapels. Trousers are trim, pleatless and tapered.
&HE NEW DIMENSION ¡„ stretch couples with
the popular button-down collar shirt—still the 
campus frontrunner—to create a new trim look. 
The introduction of the slightly elastic, non­
binding collar, and the body-shaped styling 
effectively eliminates old-fashioned puffy sags 
and the inherent sloppiness of crinkled collars. 
The advantage of stretch fibers in rainwear is 
a largely functional one. Moisture in the air 
tends to be absorbed by fabrics and cause them 
to cling. Thus, a raincoat blended with expandable fibers creates a 
Hew dimension in flexible comfort for the wearer.

&HE SWEA&ER SmENE has yet to feel the im-
pact of the stretch explosion. Yet the picture 
here has become more interesting as attention 
is focused on the popular loop stitch which has 
had so much prominence in recent years among 
golfers and other sportsmen. The loop stitch 
complements the Cardigan especially well, cre­
ating a three-dimensional effect that’s most 
pleasing to the eye. Colors are bolder and more 
positive than formerly. Vibrant reds and con­
trasting grays will be common. Strong blues 
with border treatments in yellow will be outstanding. Orange casts, 
rich golden tones, and bright greens make new additions. Of course, 
a fashion must in any wardrobe is a sweater in the light natural tan 
shades. Its versatility complements all the items of casualwear, and 
makes it a constant favorite.
Next month, as winter’s grip is loosened by the blustery March 
Winds, we’ll herald spring with a run-down of the new trends and 
innovations in dress-up suits for spring and summer. See you then.

City had an average factor of 3.29.
It would have been higher, but 
George McGeary had only a 2.41.
This is understandable, however, 
for McGeary had the audacity to 
score on seven of eight field goal 
attempts and grab eighteen re­
bounds. Not only that, but he is j jumped off to an early command-

throughout the rest of the contest, 
but the clutch shooting of Jack 
Lockwood and Bob Oravetz denied 
Tech a victory. The 74-63 loss was 
Tech’s fourth straight defeat.
The Tartans played one of their 
better ball games against Alle­

Tech’s last slight hopes for a 
winning season were dashed in 
the Grove City game, which saw 
the Wolverines victorious, 86-74. 
The Tartans had previously lost 
to Geneva, 67-55, in a pre­
finals week clash, and to West­
minster, 74-63. Giving some 
slight comfort was a win over 
Allegheny, 76-62.
Against Geneva, Tech played a 
slow-down game in the early 
minutes, and possessed a 15-13
lead with 9:51 remaining in the , , , , .
first half. The next five minutes onds.la.t?r- tl°„'vlv0.r’ ‘he "olver’

prosperity, the Tartans promptly 
threw away the ball six straight 
times, alowing the Gators to pull 
within, 8, 61-53, with five minutes 
remaining. Tech managed to re­
group its forces, however, and 
went on to a 76-62 win. Kalin 
had 29 points, Keefer had 15, and 
a vastly improved Ray Burdette 
collected 11, with 10 rebounds.
The Grove City game was 
close until the middle of the first 
half. With 8:04 remaining, the 
contest was tied 23-23. Fifty see­

Tech went scoreless, and the |
Golden Tornados took a 31-22; 
lead at half-time. Tech, behind 60-

game, staged a late rally to come , _ ,, . . , _ . .within five, 60-55, but Geneva!s wf^ fin.sh-

fantastic playing of George Mc­
Geary, the Tartans did manage to 
come within five, 63-58, midway 
in the second half, but Grove
managed to hold off the Tartans 
and walk away with a 67-55 win.
In the rematch of the West­
