Playpower offers video games, 
skills to youth internationally
JENNIFER THARP
Staffwriter
Oregon Trail and Lem­
onade Stand games on an 
Apple II computer probably 
raise a sense of nostalgia 
among many who played 
these games as children. 
Although obsolete in the 
United States now, eight-bit 
games are making a come­
back for educational pur­
poses in developing coun­
tries through the work 
of Ph.D. student Derek 
Lomas at the Human- 
Computer Interaction 
Institute (HCII) and his 
organization, Playpower.
The original inspira­
tion came from a 2007 
internship with Qual­
comm in India, where Lo­
mas noticed inexpensive 
computers, about $12 in 
U.S. dollars, being sold 
in Indian markets. While 
experimenting to see 
how well the computers, 
based off only an eight- 
bit processor, worked, he 
discovered that they had 
the ability to play video 
games similar to Nin­
tendo Entertainment Sys­
tem (NES).
With
most of the NES patents 
expired and a wealth of in­
formation left by hackers 
of the system, this seemed 
to be a perfect opportunity 
for Lomas to begin creat­
ing free educational video 
games for a new generation 
of learners.
“It is exciting to see games 
like these being made avail­
able at little or no cost to 
students around the world
and re-creating the cycle of 
educational impact,” said 
Daniel Siewiorek, director 
of the HCII.
An idea that generated 
interest among volunteers 
was of incorporating Hindu 
mythology into the games, 
creating a cultural compo­
nent to attract young us­
ers. “One of the goals of the

Carnegie Mellon’s 14th 
annual community-wide 
gender conference, MOSAIC, 
will be held on Sunday, Feb. 
28 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in 
the University Center. The 
conference is free and open 
to the public, and it offers 
11 sessions on topics ranging 
from the history of feminism 
to the biological and social 
basis for gender.
“More than awareness, 
we want to create a space 
where people can have con­
versations they may not be 
able to have otherwise,” said 
Rowshan Palmer, the advisor
for MOSAIC. Echoing that, 
MOSAIC 2010 offers sessions 
on often-controversial issues, 
from “What Feminists say 
about Pornography” to “The 
(In) visibility of Transmen.” 
Ashley Brown, the MOSA­
IC Committee chair and the 
Student Life gender/GLBT 
intern, agreed that “the MO­
SAIC gender conference pulls 
in interest from every part of 
the gender/GLBT spectrum, 
allowing everyone to find his

choice.”

Carnegie Mellon has re­
cently announced one of its 
lowest tuition increases in 
decades. This year’s increase 
of 2.98 percent for all under­
graduates follows on the heels 
of last year’s even smaller in­
crease of 2.94 percent.
Although the tuition in­
crease is the same for under­
graduates, students will still 
pay different amounts, rang­
ing from $39,222 to $41,500, 
depending on their class 
level.
“Carnegie Mellon has had 
a system of tiered increases in 
the past that helped to hold 
the line on costs for enrolled 
students,” said Ken Walters, 
Carnegie Mellon’s senior me­
dia relations director. “For 
students who entered Carn­
egie Mellon in 2006, tuition 
will be $39,222. Tuition for 
students who came to Carn­
egie Mellon in 2007 will be 
$40,740. For students who 
entered the university in 
2008 or 2009, tuition will be 
$41,500.”
Room and board costs for 
undergraduates staying on 
campus have also increased 
by 4 to 6 percent, depending 
on the particular living ac­
commodations. On average, 
housing will now cost $6500 
(including the $300 reserva­
tion fee) per year, while board 
will cost $4500. In total, the 
Carnegie Mellon admissions 
department estimates that 
the 2010-11 academic year 
will cost upperclassmen up­
wards of $50,000, while in­
coming first-years will pay 
upwards of $52,000.
According to The Chronicle 
of Higher Education, Carnegie 
Mellon is the most expensive
Celia Ludwinski/Photo Editor
educational institution in 
Pennsylvania and the seventh 
most expensive in the coun­
try this academic year.
“It is worth noting that 
Carnegie Mellon has always 
delivered exceptional educa­
tional programs at a compar­
atively low cost, as compared 
to many of our peer institu­
tions,” said Michael Murphy, 
the vice president for campus 
affairs. “In fact, U.S. News 
and World Report rated the 
university as a Great School, 
Great Price in its rankings 
this year.”
The new tuition increase 
is, by a significant margin, 
one of Carnegie Mellon’s 
smallest increases in 35 
years, slightly larger than last 
year’s record-breaking lowest 
increase of 2.94 percent. Pri­
or to 2009, Carnegie Mellon’s 
tuition increased between 5 
and 8 percent each year, but 
the university quickly re-eval- 
uated this practice after the 
economic recession hit.
“Carnegie Mellon uses tu­
ition to sustain educational 
and student life programs 
and initiatives of all types, 
as well as to support finan­
cial aid, which is especially 
critical at this time,” Murphy 
said. “These economic times 
present a challenge for the 
university, but also for our 
students and their families, 
so a relatively low increase is 
the right thing to do.”
Of course, tuition increas­
es, no matter how small, are 
never welcomed by anyone, 
particularly during tough 
economic times. This conflict 
is heightened by the commu­
nity’s and the city’s recent de­
bate over a proposed tuition 
tax. However, there seems to

Pittsburgh seeks new Google broadband
CNN’s Steve Perry to speak at Carnegie 
Mellon's Black History Month celebration

On Feb. 10, web giant 
Google outlined its plans to 
offer ultra-high-speed broad­
band Internet services to a 
select few locations across 
the nation. The communities 
Google selects will be “test­
bed” communities that serve 
to demonstrate the benefits 
of faster broadband access.
The Internet service is pre­
dicted to operate at speeds of 
1 gigabit per second. Google’s 
fiber-optic initiative is said to 
be more than 100 times faster 
than the speeds available to 
consumers today. The com­
pany has confirmed that it 
will pay for the construction 
and operation of the services 
and will charge customers 
prices competitive to current 
services.
Two days later, on Feb. 12, 
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl an­
nounced his ambition for the 
city of Pittsburgh to be select­
ed as one of these “testbed” 
communities.
Soon after, Carnegie Mel­
lon also declared its intent to 
assist the city in its endeavor.
Last week, President Jared 
L. Cohon stated in a press re­
lease that “[Carnegie Mellon 
and the city of Pittsburgh] 
are excited that Google plans 
to deploy ultra-high-speed 
networks in locations around 
the country.... As a leader in 
innovative broadband net­
working, Carnegie Mellon 
is pleased to partner with 
Mayor Ravenstahl, the City 
of Pittsburgh, UPMC, the 
University of Pittsburgh, and 
other community institutions 
and businesses to bring one 
of these networks to our com­
munity.”
Support from important 
businesses and institutions 
will also go a long way in 
contributing to the city’s bid. 
The University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center, a recognized 
leader in advanced health 
care technology, has recently 
identified itself as one such 
supporter. The University of 
Pittsburgh has also declared

dent body are buzzing with 
excitement about this year’s 
Black History Month keynote 
speaker at Carnegie Mellon: 
CNN Education Contributor 
Steve Perry. Perry has been 
revolutionizing education in 
America and is particularly in­
fluential in the African Ameri­
can community.
Born on his mother’s 16th 
birthday, into his family’s 
third generation of poverty, 
Perry personifies his belief 
that the success of a life is de­
termined by where one ends, 
not where one starts. The 
first in his family to receive 
a high school diploma, Perry 
also went on to graduate from 
college, obtain a master’s de­
gree in social work from the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
and later recieved a Ph.D. in 
education.
Perry is on a mission to 
close the achievement gap
and transform the lives of un­
derprivileged and minority 
children by providing tools to 
gain access to a college educa­
tion.
Perry’s visit is sure to at-
tract a diverse crowd of stu­
dents and faculty. M. Shernell

fice of Student Affairs, has 
been instrumental in bringing
Perry to campus.

Skloot to discuss new book STUDIO holds symposium
Carnegie Mellon’s English 
department and the Victor E. 
Bearg Scholars in Humanities 
and Sciences Speaker Series 
will host award-winning non­
fiction and science writer Re­
becca Skloot. Skloot will dis­
cuss her newly released book, 
The Immortal Life of Henrietta 
Lacks.
This nonfiction piece dis­
cusses an individual whose 
cancerous cells were re­
moved, without her knowl­
edge, in the 1950s by doctors 
at Johns Hopkins University. 
These cells were to become 
the first “immortal” human 
cells grown. Called “HeLa” 
cells, they have played impor­
tant roles in medical research 
from the development of the 
polio vaccine to current work 
on in vitro fertilization and
gene mapping.
Skloot’s feature stories, 
essays, and reviews have 
appeared in a vast array of 
publications, including The 
New York Times Magazine, 
Discover, the Columbia Jour­
nalism Review, and O, The 
Oprah Magazine. Skloot is 
also a CQntributing editor for 
Popular Science and has been 
a correspondent for multime­
dia programs including NPR 
and PBS.
Skloot currently teaches 
creative nonfiction in the 
MFA program at the Univer­
sity of Memphis. She is also 
is a faculty member at the 
yearly Mid-Atlantic Summer 
Creative Nonfiction Writ­
ers Conference and a former 
University of Pittsburgh non­
fiction faculty member.
Carnegie Mellon’s STU­
DIO for Creative Inquiry 
will host media-based per­
formers Sandra Gibson and 
Luis Recoder as a part of the 
center’s symposium on new 
approaches to media perfor­
mance. Gibson and Recoder 
will lecture on the concept 
and process of media-based 
performance. After the lec­
ture, the artists will present 
a performance centered on 
multiple 16-millimeter pro­
jectors with live audio.
The live piece employs a 
variety of non-art objects in­
cluding 16-millimeter loops, 
spray bottles, colored gels, 
unfocused lenses, and hand 
shadows. These objects will 
combine to create slowly 
transforming light sculp­
tures.
Gibson and Recoder have 
shown their collaborative 
film installations and perfor­
mances at film festivals, mu­
seums, galleries, and alterna­
tive venues since 2001. They 
have exhibited their work at 
prestigious institutions in­
cluding the Whitney Museum 
of American Art, The Kitch­
en, Robert Beck Memorial 
Cinema, and Mighty Robot 
in New York City; Hallwalls 
Contemporary Arts in Buf­
falo, N.Y.; and the Images

Toward the Bionic 
Human: Medical Devices 
and How They Are 
Powered
Today at 4:30 p.m. 
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
The first human implant 
of a lithium battery took 
place over 35 years ago, and 
undoubtedly times have 
changed and technologies 
have improved. Back then, 
the battery was a lithium-io- 
dine cell used for powering a 
cardiac pacemaker. Recently, 
a number of other battery sys­
tems — including pacemak­
ers, neurostimulators, drug 
pumps, implantable cardiac 
defibrillators, and heart assis­
tance or replacement devices 
— have been developed and 
successfully implemented in 
the medical world.
Although the power cells 
used in these apparatuses 
vary, there are requirements 
that all cells must meet, in­
cluding safety, reliability, low 
weight, small size, predict­
ability of performance, low 
self-discharge, and an end- 
of-life indication.
In her talk, Esther S. 
Takeuchi (SUNY distin­
guished professor at the Uni­
versity of Buffalo for chemical 
and biological engineering, 
electrical engineering, and 
chemistry) will also discuss 
cell parameters and device 
performance factors.
A Self-Determination 
Theory View of Close 
Relationships: Does 
Autonomy Help or Hurt?
Today at 4:30 p.m.
Erwin Steinberg Auditorium 
/ (Baker Hall A53)
Research has proven that 
autonomous motivation has 
positive consequences for 
heuristic performance as 
well as psychological well­
being. Evidence also shows 
that when authority figures 
support the people they are 
responsible for, those people 
become more autonomous 
and display positive out­
comes.
However, it is often de­
bated that in close relation­
ships it is necessary to forego
autonomy in order to have a 
successful relationship.
In his lecture, Edward L. 
Deci (Helen F. and Fred H. 
Gowen Professor in the de­
partment of clinical and so­
cial sciences in psychology at 
the University of Rochester) 
will review several studies 
that have found positive re: 
suits for autonomy in close 
friendships, romantic part­
nerships, and developing re­
lationships.

an interest in partnering in 
this effort.
In order for the city to be 
chosen, it is crucial that it 
garner community support 
for the project. First-year CIT 
student Benjamin Wasserman 
is one of a growing number of 
individuals who support the 
city’s pursuit of Google’s new 
service.
“The city is in a state of 
growth. Pittsburgh is sym­
bolic of development and 
modernization, and the fact 
that the G-20 was here last 
year shows that... super-high- 
speed broadband would only 
develop the city even more,” 
Wasserman said.
David Sandor, a first-year 
economics major, shares Was- 
serman’s excitement for faster 
web services.
“I say go for it. If [Carn­
egie Mellon] can help the city 
bring Google’s services here 
and it turns out to be success­
ful, I am sure it will strength­
en the university’s reputation 
as a technological center,” 
said Wasserman.
Tim Hoffman, a profes­
sor in the school of computer 
science believes that Pitts­
burgh’s prusuit .of the new 
broadband service will pro­
vide benefits to the city as a 
whole, echoing the thoughts 
of both president Cohon and 
Wasserman. “It can only be 
good for the city,” he said.
“It provides more jobs and 
creates an incentive for 
Google to stay in Pitts­
burgh.”
Hoffman was, how­
ever, also quick to ques­
tion the proposal. “On the 
other hand, I don’t know if 
Google is asking anything in 
return. The company may ask 
for a tax break or rebate.” 
Despite doubts, Hoffman 
hopes that Carnegie Mellon 
students could contribute to 
the designation process be­
cause of their “willingness to 
participate.”
If Google were to select 
Pittsburgh for their project, 
Hoffman did not doubt- 
that the company could find 
helpful “CMU students who 
[would] volunteer to use the 
service.”
Whether Google ultimate­
ly selects Pittsburgh is yet to 
be seen, but if Google’s deci­
sion process is purely based 
on enthusiasm, it does not 
need to look past this city.

cus it less on race and more 
on empowering our students 
to act and make a positive im­
pact in their community. I be­
lieve Perry will be the catalyst 
for positive discussion and ac­
tion on campus,” she said.
Perry was featured on the
2009 CNN special Black in 
America, which showcased 
Capital Preparatory Magnet 
School in Hartford, Conn., 
which Perry founded and 
where he now acts as prin­
cipal. U.S. News and World 
Report cited Capital Prepara­
tory as one of the best high 
schools in the nation. Perry’s
school has sent 100 percent 
of its low-income, minority, 
first-generation high school 
graduates to four-year col­
leges every year since its es­
tablishment in 2004.
His segment on CNN dur­
ing “Black in America” was so 
well received that Perry was 
asked by CNN to become the 
education contributor and 
is frequently on AC360 with 
Anderson Cooper and other 
CNN programs discussing 
national education-focused 
initiatives.
Stephanie Schneider, a 
sophomore business admin­
istration major and Student 
Senator, said that she is look­
ing forward to the event.
“Coming from a school 
with people from so many 
backgrounds, I hope Dr. 
Perry can share with us how 
he encouraged people to 
live against stereotypes and 
understand they can be any­
thing they want to be. It’s 
something we will be able to 
carry on wherever we go in 
life,” Schneider said.
“My hometown has a huge 
achievement gap and the ad­
ministration have [sic] not
been able to encourage its clo­
sure. I am excited to see how 
he motivated his students, 
since it is something so many 
people have been trying to do 
for years,” Schneider said. “I 
wish I could bring my home­
town administration to come, 
and see what he has to say. It’s 
a serious issue where I come 
from that nobody knows how 
to fix.”
Carnegie Mellon Student 
Body President Rotimi Abim- 
bola is also very enthusiastic 
about Perry’s lecture. “I think 
it’s important for people like 
Dr. Perry to come to speak at 
Carnegie Mellon during Black 
History Month so people can 
understand how far the black 
community has progressed,” 
Abimbola said.
“He’s not just coming to 
talk about education for in­
ner-city black kids; he’s com­
ing to talk about education in 
America.... What’s really im­
portant to understand is that 
Dr. Perry’s impact on educa­
tion is impacting the future of

be a general sentiment among 
the campus community that 
such increases are necessary 
to maintain the quality that is 
unique to Carnegie Mellon.
“I find it hard to hold it 
against the university because 
they hire top-tier teachers 
and researchers, and that is 
expensive,” said sophomore 
business administration ma­
jor Jie Zhao.
“Many of us probably came
here to learn from these peo­
ple, so it makes sense that we 
should have to pay for them 
and to keep them.”
Murphy agrees that tu­
ition increases are neccesary 
to maintain the quality of the 
university.
“We continually hear the 
same refrain from both par­
ents and students — that 
maintaining the extraordi­
nary quality of our education­
al programs is of paramount 
importance to them.”
Even with one of the high­
est tuitions in the country, 
Carnegie Mellon still must 
rely on the charity of donors 
and alumni, as well as on 
other various student fees, to 
break even.
“Tuition does not cover the 
total cost of educating a full­
time student.” Murphy said. 
“We work very hard, just as 
our students do, to continu­
ously enhance our standing as 
one of the world’s great uni­
versities.”

Secretary Hillary Clinton visits Qatar campus
COURTNEY WITTEKIND
News Editor
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham 
Clinton visited Carnegie Mellon’s campus in 
Qatar’s Education City last week.
Clinton visited the campus to participate in 
a question-and-answer session with members 
of Education City’s community. Students, fac­
ulty, and staff chosen to represent each uni­
versity in Education City made up the audi­
ence of 600.

The event was organized and moderated 
by Al-Jazeera International, a news and cur­
rent affairs TV channel headquartered in 
Doha, Qatar. Al-Jazeera collaborated with the 
Qatar Foundation and Carnegie Mellon Qatar 
to bring the event to campus.
The event was titled “Townterview” and fit 
into a series of events that cover international 
issues centered in Washington, D.C. The ses­
sion was moderated by Abderrahim Foukara, 
the Washington bureau chief of Al-Jazeera In­
ternational.
According to a recent Carnegie Mellon 
press release, Clinton spoke highly of Educa­
tion City’s commitment to internationally fo­
cused education.
“I have been following the progress of Ed­
ucation City from the United States, and I am 
delighted to be able to see with my own eyes 
the extraordinary commitment of the Qatar 
Foundation, his highness the emir, and of the 
people of Qatar to the importance of educa­
tion,” Clinton said.
Clinton discussed a variety of current af-

fairs and relevant issues with those who at­
tended the event, accepting questions from 
students studying in Education City as well 
as members of the local community. Issues 
spanned a wide range of topics including nu­
clear weapons in Iran, the Israeli/Palestinian 
situation, and Clinton’s own role in President 
Obama’s administration.

involved with issues of gender 
relations and construction.
One in Four, a national 
organization whose name 
comes from the statistic that 
one in four college women 
has survived rape or attempt­
ed rape since her 14th birth­
day, will host “How to Help 
a Sexual Assault Survivor: 
What Men Can Do.” This ses­
sion will offer men advice on 
what to do if a sexual assault 
victim approaches them for 
help, with the goal of empow­
ering men to help eliminate 
sexual assault on campuses 
nationwide.
In a session titled “Making 
a Difference — Locally!” stu­
dents will also be invited to 
volunteer with a variety of lo­
cal community groups includ­
ing 100 Black Men, Big Broth­
ers Big Sisters, and Strong 
Women, Strong Girls.
Lisa Tetrault is leading a 
session titled “F-Word: Femi­
nism 101.” The presentation 
will provide a brief history of 
feminism and facilitate a dis­
cussion on the modern con­
notations of the word “femi­
nism.”
“I think it is useful to dis­
cuss why it is young women 
feel it is so dangerous to iden­
tify as a feminist and to under­
stand that this identification 
does have real costs,” Tetrault 
said.
MOSAIC is seen as espe­
cially important to H&SS’s rel­
atively unknown gender stud­
ies minor. Kristina Straub, the 
faculty advisor for the minor, 
described the gender studies 
courses as popular with stu­
dents in a variety of majors, 
despite low enrollment in the 
minor. She explained that 
“having that mix of majors 
contributes to an- interdisci­
plinary discussion. Gender 
studies, in some of its best in­
stantiations, is interdisciplin­
ary.”
The conference will end 
with a live student perfor­
mance of The Vagina Mono­
logues, directed by first-year 
drama major Lio Sigerson. 
MOSAIC’S closing will also 
include the screening of clips 
from a filmed performance of 
The Men’s Story Project. Ac-
cording to the official websjte 
www.mensstoryproject. org, 
The Men’s Story is a “public 
performance and community 
dialogue project that explores 
social ideas about masculin­
ity, using the arts as a medium 
for community-building and 
social change.”
Carnegie Mellon also hosts 
other events throughout the 
year focused on women and 
gender studies. These include 
upcoming events in March, 
for Women’s History Month, 
and Speak Your Mind, a se­
ries of monthly discussions on 
current events.
MOSAIC is sponsored by 
Student Life, Student Dor­
mitory Council, Women’s 
Leadership Institute, Student 
Senate, Multicultural and Di­
versity Initiatives, the Activi­
ties Board, and a number of 
other groups.

project has to do with the fact 
that video games are a cul­
tural expression that is only 
really expressed in countries 
that are rich enough to afford 
PS3. The idea that you could 
have games reflective of these 
cultures where it could be 
bought by a common person 
... is pretty cool,” Lomas said.
For example, Hanuman, 
an ape-like god of immense 
power and a reincarnation of 
Shiva, is the hero in the first 
game. This game teaches typ­
ing not only as a skill, but also 
as a pathway to job opportu­
nities. “Being comfortable 
typing on a computer might 
help not just to teach [users] 
to type quickly, but to give 
them a culture with comput­
ers. That is important,” Lomas 
said.
With the success of the 
movie Slumdog Millionaire in 
2008, the second game will 
appeal to families in India. It 
is hoped that this quiz show 
game will encourage families
to discuss topics together as 
they play it on their television 
screen. A third video game 
addresses the public health 
issue of malaria in India, as 
children kill mosquitoes and 
buy nets and kerosene for pro­
tection.
Awarded $180,000 in 
grants last year from the Mac­
Arthur Foundation, Playpow­
er hopes to have the video 
games prepared for June to 
present to the foundation. Af­
ter that, the games would be 
introduced into manufactur­
ing and everyday households, 
rewarding the work of over 
100 global volunteers. The 
collaborative effort also held 
a two-week workshop in India 
in December in which three 
Carnegie Mellon professors 
participated.
“I see Playpower as an ini­
tiative to develop a broader 
community who will work on 
e-learning games for under­
privileged children in devel­
oping countries,” said Mat­
thew Kam, Lomas’s adviser. 
“As such, Playpower is one
mechanism for us to get our 
research results into the hands 
of real-world designers.”
Although Playpower has 
numerous volunteers, there 
are few in Pittsburgh. Lomas 
sees students as potential vol­
unteers, as he suggests that 
volunteer work for Playpower 
could be incorporated into the 
classroom — especially with 
computer science and electri­
cal and computer engineering 
students at Carnegie Mellon.
“Hardware hacking, as­
sembly programming, music 
... there are many ways stu­
dents can help, even helping 
finish the designs of the games 
if they don’t program,” Lomas 
said. Lomas encouraged inter­
ested persons to visit volun­
teer s.playpower. org.
Lomas explained that he 
feels his project has found a 
home at Carnegie Mellon. 
“Maybe the best thing is that I 
was able to come to Carnegie 
Mellon with this project be­
cause there is an acceptance 
here for doing research that 
has an impact,” he said.

Fischbeck’s model predicts odds of deathHEALTH TALK

For many people, death 
is high up on the list of big­
gest fears in life. With a Car­
negie Mellon-based website, 
DeathRiskRankings.com, 
people can now find statistical 
evidence that will tell them 
their odds of dying within a 
certain period of time.
Professor Paul Fischbeck, 
who is part of both the social 
and decision science dhd en­

from engineering risks to in­

The website began as an 
undergraduate research proj­

systems department as early 
as the fall of 2008.
The project began primari­

major issue facing the govern­

In arguments concerning 
different healthcare issues, 
the two major metrics that are

and genders.
Using these criteria, one

Aquagenic pruritis: 
An allergy to water
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Contributing Editor
A 1981 article in the Brit­
ish Medical Journal describes 
three cases that had doctors 
perplexed. In all the cases, 
patients complained of severe 
irritation and itching after 
coming into contact of one 
the most ordinary substances 
on earth — water.
Furthermore, there were 
no visible symptoms on the 
skin that could point toward 
the cause of the patients’ dis­
comfort.
With no outward signs 
of an allergy, doctors were
unsure as to what the exact 
cause of this strange condi­
tion was.
In most cases, the itching 
was felt in the lower parts of 
the body, most notably the 
legs and thighs.
Patients usually start no­
ticing the symptoms after 
taking a bath. In one case 
that was reported in the Brit­
ish Medical Journal article, 
the patient was immersed in 
water at around 37°C for 15 
minutes and started feeling 
itchy in the thighs about four 
minutes into the study.

HOW THINGS WORKUnexplained natural phenomena: Ball lig l-o’-the-wisps
BRIAN LEE
SciTech Editor
Humans have inhabited the 
world for over 10,000 years, 
but a complete understand­
ing of nature has proven to be 
elusive. In fact, there is much 
about natural phenomena we 
still do not know. Ball light­
ning and will-o’-the-wisp are 
two such phenomena that sci­
ence cannot fully explain.
Ball lightning
In 1809, witnesses on the 
British ship HMS Warren Hast­
ings reported three flaming 
balls attacking the crewmen 
during a storm. One orb set 
the deck on fire, while another 
orb struck and killed two oth­
er crewmen by burning them. 
This story, as told by Times On­
line, can now be explained by 
ball lightning.
Although more widely ac­
cepted to be folklore than sci­
ence, ball lightning observa­
tions have been reported for 
many centuries. According 
to howstuffworks.com, even 
Czar Nicholas II saw such an 
orb at church as a child. While 
research has attempted to rec­
reate ball lightning in labo­
ratories, there is no widely 
accepted or complete theory 
explaining its existence.
Ball lightning is character­
ized by its round shape, which 
varies from the size of a golf 
ball to the size of a beach ball. 
Its motion is erratic, unpre­
dictable, and seemingly unaf­
fected by wind.
Many eyewitness accounts 
explain that ball lightning can 
enter and exit rooms through 
openings or by passing through 
solid objects. Although it lasts 
longer than normal lightning, 
it eventually dissipates, some­
times gradually and some­
times with a loud, explosive 
popping noise.
One possible explanation 
of ball lightning includes sili­
con, as reported by New Scien­
tist. During storms, lightning 
can strike the ground, vapor­
ising silicon present in soil. 
This vaporized silicon in the 
air then condenses as it cools, 
but because it is charged it 
forms a ball shape. The glow­
ing of the lightning ball is due 
to extremely hot silicon re­
acting with oxygen in the air. 
This claim has been backed 
by researchers at the Federal 
University of Pernambuco in 
Brazil, who managed to cre­
ate “luminous orbs the size of 
ping-pong balls that persisted 
for up to eight seconds,” ac­
cording to New Scientist.
The high heat of over 
3000°F melted plastic. An­
other explanation is that ball 
lightning is an aerogel, which 
has an extremely low density 
for a solid. The aerogel has a 
current that passes through it, 
which forms a ball shape.
Another unsurprising ex­
planation for ball lightning is 
that its appearances are mere 
hallucinations.
Will-o’-the-wisps
In The Lord of the Rings, Gol- 
lum leads Frodo through the 
Dead Marshes, a swamp maze 
littered with the incorporeal 
bodies of the dead. Each body 
holds a candle, which appears 
as a flame floating over the 
water.
While we do not live in 
Middle Earth, will-o’-the- 
wisps are unexpectedly simi­
lar to the candles of the dead. 
They are lights that appear to 
flicker, seen at night over bod­
ies of water such as swamps 
and bogs. When they are ap­
proached, it is often said they 
burn out.

Ball lightning is a natural phenomena that appears as a spherical, luminous object moving erratically. Many 
eyewitness accounts claim the ball lightning entered rooms through doors or open windows;, breaking objects in 
its path.
While not exactly candles 
of the dead, will-o’-the-wisps 
can be explained by decaying 
organic matter. This decay re­
leases the gases methane and 
phosphine. Both are highly 
flammable and will ignite un­
der normal atmospheric con­
ditions.
This explanation may show 
how the flame is created, 
but does not explain why the 
light fades as the observer 
approaches, or why the light
seems to move along with the 
observer at times. Another ex­
planation is bioluminescence
— for example, barn owls have 
luminescent feathers — which 
may explain how the lights 
seem to move.

Flower fragrance genes isolatedCompanies profit from censorshipMalaria may have killed Tutankhamen
The past 50 years have seen flower breeders selectively culti­
vating only those flowers that are large and considered pretty, in 
an effort to improve quality. While they succeeded in this goal, 
these “better” flowers lost much of their scent because they lost 
the appropriate fragrance genes. Scientists at the University of 
Florida have found these missing genes and believe that they 
will be able to do more than just restore scent to flowers; they 
will be able to change their scent at will.
The researchers were studying the genome of petunias when 
they noticed that a certain block of 12 or 13 genes was miss­
ing. After re-inserting the genes one at a time to figure out their 
function, the scientists found that they regulated the release of 
chemicals that give petunias their-scent. They hope that this dis­
covery will extend to other flowers and fruits and bring about 
major improvements in their taste and smell.
As some countries continue to restrict access to the Internet, 
more and more people are finding ways around these restrictions 
so they can access the sites they want to. Companies that sell 
products allowing them to do this are seeing significant growth. 
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are one of the most effective 
ways to avoid restrictions by allowing users to access the Internet 
through servers in other countries while preventing their own 
country’s censors from tracking them.
Companies such as AnchorFree provide free help in finding a 
way through firewalls. Others, such as the creators of the appli­
cation Puff, provide a free basic program, or one with more fea­
tures for a fee. Over the last year, AnchorFree has seen 500 per­
cent growth. While providing and selling such methods is often 
illegal in the countries where they are used, most of the sellers 
live in other countries and are thus immune from prosecution.
A study on Tuesday reported that radiation and genetic test­
ing of several Egyptian mummies, including that of King Tut­
ankhamen, has revealed new information about a segment of 
the ancient Egyptian royal family.
Most notably, researchers have found that Tutankhamen, the 
well-known boy king, is likely to have died of a particularly viru­
lent and harmful strain of malaria called malaria tropica. This 
marks the oldest confirmed case of malaria ever discovered.
The study also notes that he suffered from a disorder of the 
bones that may have caused a fracture that he is seen to have, 
and a condition where blood supply is decreased to tissues in the 
body, weakening them. The genetic testing reveals the relation­
ships between five generations of pharaohs and their immediate 
families, many of which had previously been based upon specu­
lation alone.

Laser revolutionizes mosquito repellants
DIPIKA SHRIHARI
Junior Staffwriter
It is something right out of 
a Star Trek episode: Out of a 
showy weapon flashes a laser 
beam and — a bug drops to 
the floor? Nathan Myhrvold, 
Microsoft’s former chief tech­
nology officer, presented a 
laser that shoots down bugs at 
the annual TEDTalks confer­
ence in Long Beach, Calif, this 
month.
The idea for such a laser 
was envisioned in 2008 by Bill 
Gates, a malaria-prevention 
advocate. He brought up the 
idea in a conference. Later, 
during the 2009 TED con­
ference, he said, “Malaria 
is spread by mosquitoes. I 
brought some. There is no rea­
son only poor people should 
be infected.” And with that, 
he unleashed mosquitoes into 
the crowd.
Initially, many people 
had discarded Gates’ idea of
a gun to kill mosquitoes as a 
joke. However, Myhrvold ana­
lyzed the requirements, and, 
against skepticism, he created 
the gun.
What makes this laser in­
teresting, however, is how it 
is made. Although it was de­
signed by Myhrvold’s Intellec­
tual Ventures Laboratory, the 
laser gun is made using every­
day household items, such as 
parts of printers, cameras, and 
projectors.
The precision of laser print­
ers, the imaging technology of 
certain cameras, and the pow­
er of Blu-ray made the laser 
relatively easy to create. The 
laser from the TEDTalk dem­
onstration was made using 
only parts bought on eBay.
This gun was demonstrated 
at the conference by releasing 
mosquitoes into a glass tank, 
where the laser would strike 
the mosquitoes. This event 
was recorded and replayed in 
slow motion so the details of
the bug’s obliteration could be 
observed. The mosquito’s body 
would become wisps of smoke 
curls with wings still beating. 
What is special about this laser 
gun are its additional options. 
It detects the size and speed of 
objects so that it will not harm 
something other than mosqui­
toes. One can press buttons 
and choose to increase the 
intensity for larger mosquito 
concentrations. The lasers can 
shoot between 50 to 100 mos­
quitoes per second, according 
to The New York Times.
Myhrvold’s vision for this 
new technology is for it to 
become commonplace. He 
estimates that the price of the 
laser gun in market could be 
as low as $50.
With an instrument so 
cheap, some may raise con­
cerns about how this would 
affect the delicate balance 
of life. The laser is so precise 
that it can not only target mos­
quitoes, but it can also deter­
mine its gender. Since female 
mosquitoes are the only ones 
that sting, the laser will let the 
males go.
But why combat mosqui­
toes in the first place? The idea 
is not to battle just any pesky 
insect that will sting you.
This laser gun is hoped 
to help in the prevention of 
deadly diseases like malaria, 
which are transmitted pri­
marily through mosquitoes. 
A child dies every 30 seconds 
from malaria, according to the 
World Health Organization.
Although there have been 
earlier versions of such a 
malaria-combating laser, this 
is the first one to be made so 
cheaply that it can actually be 
mass produced and be used by 
just about anyone.
Currently, Myhrvold is 
looking into how feasible it is 
to ship such equipment out to 
those in third-world countries 
where malaria is more preva­
lent.

Obscure water allergy perplexes physicians
WATER, from A5
After 15 minutes, the itch 
had spread to the patient’s 
back. In spite of the itches, 
there were no outward signs 
of allergy on the skin.
The article goes on to de­
scribe that such symptoms 
were initially attributed to 
psychological disorders. Pa­
tients presenting such symp­
toms were considered “neu­
rotic,” or these symptoms 
were attributed to individual 
personality disorders.
It wasn’t until the 1980s 
that this disorder—now given 
the name of aquagenic pruri­
tus — was considered a legiti­
mate concern and discussed 
widely in medical literature.
Although the main cause 
of this condition still remains 
unknown, it does show simi­
larities with common allergic 
reactions. Allergies are pro-
duced by abnormal reactions 
of the body’s immune system. 
Cells known as mast cells are 
the major players in an aller­
gic reaction.
Mast cells are located 
around blood vessels in most 
tissues. These cells have a 
number of granules inside 
them, which are small vesicles 
that contain a host of chemi­
cals.
Upon coming in contact 
with allergens, these gran­
ules release their chemicals 
into the bloodstream. This 
process is termed degranula­
tion of the mast cells. One of 
the many chemicals released 
is histamine, which induces a 
number of reactions into the 
surrounding tissues that cause 
the symptoms of an allergy.
Skin biopsies of patients 
with aquagenic pruritus show 
that they have elevated levels 
of degranulated mast cells. In
addition, blood tests in such 
patients revealed that the 
blood also had increased lev­
els of histamine.
What still intrigues physi­
cians about this disorder is 
the aberrant physiology of pa­
tients with this allergy. High 
levels of histamine and de­
granulated cells are present in 
the skin even before the skin is 
immersed in water.
Some have correlated this 
increase with an increase in 
sweating in the patients. An­
other puzzling factor about 
the disease is that there are no 
visible symptoms on the skin 
in spite of the involvement of 
histamine and the typical al­
lergic reactions.
Researchers believe that 
may be because histamine is 
released slowly from the cells. 
Also, it has been hypothesized 
that water on the outer layer 
of the skin, called the stratum
corneum, may cause the ab­
sorption of molecules within 
the skin that leads to allergic 
reactions.
Since the exact cause of the 
disorder is not known, specific 
treatments for the disorder 
are also not known. Research 
is being conducted to find a 
method that may reduce or 
elminate symptoms of the al­
lergy.
Antihistamines have been 
known to provide relief to 
patients for many kinds of al­
lergies. As stated in an article 
in the journal Hospital Physi­
cian, addition of alkaline com­
pounds such as sodium bicar­
bonate to the water can also 
ease symptoms.
Ultraviolet light therapy 
has also been known to help 
patients. Ultimately, only a 
combination of different ther­
apies has been known to be 
effective.
DEATH, from A5
chbeck had expected.
“The ultimate risk is life 
and death,” Fischbeck said 
from his office in Porter Hall. 
“There’s always been an in­
terest in quantifying how 
risky various things are.”
The website was released 
in August 2009, and during 
the first few weeks, the web­
site received about a million 
hits an hour. Now, accord­
ing to Fischbeck, “it’s gone 
way down in traffic ... and I 
get e-mails almost daily from 
people wanting to use it for 
policy discussion.”
The variables themselves 
were based on death certifi­
cate data held by the Centers 
for Disease Control in the 
United States and data held 
by various organizations 
around Europe.
Due to several differences 
in the variables and the time 
increments in which the data 
was collected, the Carnegie 
Mellon group had to make 
simplifications and compro­
mises.
The Internet is no stranger 
to sites predicting dates of 
death: Death Clock has sati­
ated people’s fear of dying 
for many years. Fischbeck is 
quick to point out differenc­
es. “What we do is we allow 
this direct comparison be­
tween all 50 states and about 
20 European countries. And 
we have 66 causes of death. 
No other site does that.” Side- 
by-side analysis between, for 
example, a white American 
55-year-old man and a white 
French 40-year-old man can 
yield some comparative re­
sults.
The overall message of the 
website was to establish the 
numbers. “The risks are often 
overestimated,” Fischbeck as­
serted. “Pepple think that the 
risks of dying in the next year 
are much higher than they re­
ally are.”
Statistics on the Kentucky 
Post website support his 
claim: 19-year-olds, for ex­
ample, only have a one- or 
two-in-a-thousand chance of 
dying this year depending on 
their race, which is a small 
probability.
With these newfound, re­
assuring numbers in mind, 
though, Fischbeck remains 
aware of the fact that people 
might take these numbers for 
granted and engage in more 
risky behavior.
However, Fischbeck found 
economic trends in health 
care around the world. Amer­
icans spend much more mon­
ey on health care every year 
for people over 80 years old 
than Europeans, even though 
the chance of dying is lower 
for these Americans than Eu­
ropeans.
Next up on Fischbeck’s 
plans is the inclusion of sev­
eral other countries into the 
DeathRiskRankings data­
base.
Canada (which could not 
provide data at the time of 
the website’s creation), Ja­
pan, and South Korea were 
definite interests. “[Asian 
countries] have much better 
life expectancies,” Fischbeck 
said, which would make for 
useful comparisons. Other 
countries, like Qatar, have al­
ready given data to be used in 
the future.
Other plans include cre­
ating other risk-assessment 
websites.
One of these websites will 
include the odds of going to 
the hospital in the next year, 
and it will give the reasons 
for going, how long the stay 
will be, and what the cost will 
be.
Fischbeck cited better 
decision-making as what he 
hopes visitors get out of his 
website. “People are now 
more informed, and I hope 
are making better decisions 
because of it,” he said.

Maria Raffaele/Art EditorJournalists risk lives for responsibility, integrity
According to the Committee to 
Protect Journalists’ (CPJ) 2009 At­
tacks on the Press Report, 71 jour­
nalists were killed in 2009 — making 
last year the worst on CPJ’s 30-year 
record. In addition to the large num­
ber of deaths, the committee said it 
also identified 136 imprisoned re­
porters, editors, and photojournal­
ists, an increase of 11 from 2008.
Here at The Tartan, we simul­
taneously mourn the loss of these
individuals while applauding the 
creed that they upheld. The history 
of journalism is one of the most no­
ble; a journalist’s first obligation has 
always been to the truth.
That obligation is followed by a 
responsibility to the public: a duty 
to be an unbiased measure of those 
in power for the sake of the people. 
Historically, these ideals have been 
defended in bitter battles, leaving 
the history of journalism laced with
violence and bloodshed.
Today, these same ideals have 
been confronted across the world 
with a violence that is unfortunately 
familiar. While the death tolls con­
tinue to rise, we can celebrate in the 
fact that these deaths, while horrific, 
represent a continued, unshakable 
commitment to the truth.
The Tartan remembers those 
journalists killed in 2009:

NBC must respect both subjects and viewers
The opening ceremony of the 
Olympics is typically met with fanfare 
and excitement, both on the part of 
the athletes and the millions around 
the world who watch the games. This 
year, however, misfortune and media 
irresponsibility have marred an oth­
erwise joyful event. On the day of the 
opening ceremonies, tragedy struck. 
Nodar Kumaritashvili, a 21-year-old 
Georgian luger, died in an accident 
during a preliminary run on the con­
troversial Whistler track — one that 
had already been criticized for its 
high speeds.
News of the Georgian’s death 
reached televisions and computers 
around the world less than an hour af­
ter the accident. A video of the shock­
ing crash was added to NBC’s videos 
online and was broadcast many times 
on live TV as well, evidently without 
consideration of ethical implications.
Since the incident, NBC has come 
under well-deserved and harsh criti­
cism. NBC’s actions in this situation 
were brash and insensitive. While 
the network has a responsibility to 
provide the news, it should also have 
respect for the people involved in the 
stories. Consultation with the fam­
ily should have occurred before the 
choice to air the video was made. 
Instead, the network ceased to show 
the video onjy with the insistence 
of the athlete’s family, who did not
want to see it.
We all know the effect that “shock 
value” has on ratings, but tragedy 
should not be abused in an effort 
to garner viewers. With the qual­
ity of NBC’s coverage of the Olympic 
Games already in question, we are 
concerned as to whether the network 
deserves its exclusive coverage of the 
games. We hope in the future that 
NBC, and media sources in general, 
will give more consideration to the 
consequences of their actions before 
proceeding with their coverage. As 
journalists, NBC editors and produc­
ers must have an ethical standard 
outside their responsibility to their 
stockholders.
University of Pittsburgh prioritizes academic study
We at Carnegie Mellon are great 
at complaining. We complain about 
stressful workloads, sleepless nights, 
and high tuition, to name a few. Most 
of us have, at least once, compared 
ourselves with those neighbors down 
in Oakland and wondered why we 
couldn’t have easier classes, earlier 
summers, and an actual life in gen­
eral. However, for once, we are not 
the ones who need to complain.
For a change, University of Pitts­
burgh students will be wishing their 
university made decisions like ours. 
That institution has decided to make
up the classes that were missed dur­
ing the three snow days two weeks 
ago by holding classes on two Satur­
days — March 27 and April 17.
Although the three snow days 
did result in a lot of economic and 
academic losses for the university, 
we are glad that Carnegie Mellon 
has not followed the University of 
Pittsburgh and decided to make up 
for the lost time. It is ironic that Car­
negie Mellon — which is usually so 
reluctant to give its students days off
— is not trying to schedule make-up 
classes, but we’re not complaining.
The worst that students at Carnegie 
Mellon may have to endure because 
of the snow days is a slightly heavier 
workload, but at least we don’t have 
to shorten our weekends.
Many students, being from Car­
negie Mellon, will probably just sit 
and study on these two Saturdays 
anyway, but at least we don’t offi­
cially have to. This might be one of 
those rare times when we could say 
that Carnegie Mellon students are 
entitled to have more of a social life 
than the students at the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Paramedics deserve blame for man’s death
An ambulance speeds down the 
street, lights flashing and siren blar­
ing. Then it stops, stuck in the two 
feet of Pittsburgh snow that has 
blanketed the ground. Paramedics, 
sworn to the Hippocratic Oath and 
trained to save lives, sit and discuss 
their next step. They can walk a 
few hundred feet through the snow 
rolling a gurney, or they can give 
up. To most of us, the choice seems 
obvious. To the paramedics answer­
ing Curtis Mitchell’s 911 call on the 
weekend of Feb. 5, the choice was 
also obvious. “If he wants a ride to 
the hospital, he is just going to have 
to come down to the truck,” one of 
them told the dispatcher.
Somehow the first responders we 
trust to help us in a crisis have con­
fused themselves with chauffeurs. 
Instead of putting forth effort to 
save a dying man, these individuals 
chose to stay in their heated ambu­
lance. Had this happened only once, 
it still would have been a travesty. 
But it did not. Mitchell and his girl­
friend made 10 calls over two days. 
By the time help finally arrived, 
Mitchell was dead.
How, in a city renowned for its 
excellent medical care, can a man 
spend over two days waiting for 
an emergency response? How can 
what appears to have been an early- 
recognized case of appendicitis kill 
a man while his girlfriend watches 
and Pittsburgh’s emergency services 
drive back and forth in the snow?
Whatever answers emerge to 
these questions, they will not be 
enough to satisfy Mitchell’s family, 
nor will they satisfy the rest of Pitts­
burgh’s residents. When we are most 
vulnerable, we trust police, firemen, 
and paramedics to put us at ease. 
The men and women who perform 
these jobs do heroic deeds every day. 
And yet, Curtis Mitchell is dead.
In the days since this tragedy, 
a few facts have come to light. The 
911 calls Mitchell made were treat­
ed as independent by dispatchers, 
meaning each ambulance did not 
know that the previous attempts 
had failed. As the priority level of 
the calls increased, they remained 
unassociated, and so mistakes were 
repeated time after time. All of this 
was happening while call centers 
were being subjected to high call 
volumes due to snow-related prob­
lems.
What we learn from the avail­
able data is that the fault for Mitch­
ell’s death lies across many areas of 
the Pittsburgh emergency medical 
response system. It lies with the 
dispatchers who failed to coordi­
nate and the planners who failed 
to predict the consequences of the 
snowstorm. It lies with whichever 
bureaucrat established the policy 
that paramedics should not walk 
through the snow to save a life. And 
it lies with the responders them­
selves who were mere blocks away 
from a dying man but turned back, 
leaving him to suffer.

Barbie battles stereotype as computer engineer
We’ve all heard — and spread
— the Carnegie Mellon stereotype: 
There aren’t that many women who 
go to school here, and those who do 
aren’t necessarily the most attrac­
tive, especially those in the techni­
cal fields. But that could be chang­
ing soon, because girls who aspire to 
be engineers or computer scientists 
have a new role model: Barbie.
Starting Jan. 11, a month-long 
poll on www.barbie.com allowed 
people to vote for their favorite 
choice of career for Barbie to under­
take next. And the result of that vot­
ing — computer engineer — is a far 
cry from the talking Barbie dolls of 
days past that used to complain that 
“math class is tough.”
The public’s choice of computer 
engineer as Barbie’s next career is 
probably the result of a few different 
things. The first is a number of Fa- 
cebook groups, a few of which I was 
invited to join (and felt obligated 
to belong to, as a fellow engineer), 
urging me to vote for Barbie to be a 
computer engineer.
But since it’s not possible that all 
of the computer engineer votes were 
garnered from Facebook groups, this 
means that people who are not engi­
neering students in college actually 
wanted to see Barbie in this career. 
And this shows a genuine shift in 
the interest of Barbie’s audience, 
especially for a doll that used to be 
mainly concerned with matching 
her shoes and purse. Now, instead, 
she can be seen checking her e-mail
from her smartphone and chatting 
on her Bluetooth headpiece (and, of 
course, wearing a fashionably cool 
binary-decorated T-shirt while do­
ing so).
Even here at Carnegie Mellon, 
a school that has a strong technical 
background, there isn’t a huge num­
ber of female engineers. While I was 
taking Introduction to Electrical and 
Computer Engineering my first year 
here, I could count the number of 
girls in my class using only my fin­
gers, and the total enrollment in this 
class was probably close to 100 stu­
dents. It is clear that even at a school 
where being an engineer isn’t really 
nerdy, a deficit of females in techni­
cal fields exists.
It is my hope that Barbie being an 
engineer will help to get rid of this 
deficit, that it gets girls interested 
in a career to which they might not 
otherwise give a second thought. 
Barbie dolls will always be one of a 
young girl’s first toys, and no matter 
how young they are, girls notice the 
different kinds of Barbies that exist
— veterinarian Barbie, teacher Bar­
bie, astronaut Barbie.
And having a computer engi­
neer Barbie will give young girls an 
introduction to a career decidedly 
lacking in female participation, an 
introduction that they might not 
have otherwise. Hopefully, Barbie 
will help, even if only in a small way, 
to remove the “geek” or “nerd” con­
notation from girls interested in en­
gineering.
Heather Tomko (Titomko@J is happy 
to call Barbie a fellow engineer, even 
if she’d never, ever wear the binary T- 
shirt.

Meat-packing industry has responsibility to reform
Since we were young, we were 
taught to recognize the common 
barnyard animals: A cow says “moo” 
and a pig says “oink,” and the two are 
by no means related to our hamburg­
er dinner or our BLT sandwich. But at 
what point did these animals stop be­
ing animals and start being food?
We are in the midst of what many 
consider to be a green revolution; 
however, few seem to realize the true 
impact that meat production has on 
our environment and our bodies. If 
this nation were to realize these so­
cial, economic, and environmental 
impacts, we could consider possible 
industry and social reforms to im­
prove the efficiency of meat produc­
tion and, with this knowledge, stimu­
late change.
Very few individuals recognize the 
consequences that the meat-packing 
industry has had on our economy, 
environment, and society. As CNN 
correspondent Jonathan Sanfran Foe 
says in his article on All-creatures.org, 
“If the way we raise animals for food 
isn’t the most important problem in 
the world right now, it’s arguably the 
No. 1 cause of global warming: The 
United Nations reports the livestock 
business generates more greenhouse 
gas emissions than all forms of trans­
portation combined.”
The meat industry is one of the 
largest in the world and, according 
to www.earthtrends.com, over 280 
million metric tons of meat were pro­
duced in 2009 alone. Though it is 
one of the largest modern industries, 
the meat production process has also 
proven to be one of the most ineffi­
cient industries today.
According to one estimate done by 
the United Nations Food and Agricul­
tural Organization (FAO), the ratio 
of fossil-fuel energy needed to pro­
duce one unit of food energy is 35:1 
for beef production, compared to 3:1 
for all U.S. agricultural products com­
bined.
As an economic industry, the meat 
industry is extremely inefficient. An 
Iowa State study estimated that the 
“external costs” of agricultural pro­
duction in the United States — in 
terms of natural resources, wildlife 
and ecosystem biodiversity, and hu­
man health — amount to between 
$5.7 billion and $16.9 billion annu­
ally. Livestock production alone is 
estimated to contribute $714 million 
to $739 million in damages. The meat 
industry, when considered economi­
cally, is not only extremely expensive, 
but the majority of the money being 
spent is on waste and methods of pro­
duction that have not been updated in 
years.
The production of livestock for 
meat harvest can be linked to almost 
every environmental catastrophe 
confronting our planet. Rainforest 
destruction, the spreading of deserts, 
the loss of fresh water, increasing air 
and water pollution, destructive acid 
rain, and soil erosion are all linked 
to the industrialized production of 
meat.
Possibly the most commonly un­
derstood side effect of the meat pack­
ing industry is the intense amounts 
of carbon dioxide released from the 
production of meat. The FAO has es­
timated that direct emissions from 
meat production account for about 
18 percent of the world’s total green­
house gas emissions.
But what can be done to pre­
vent these terrifying statistics from 
growing? While it is true that global 
industry contributors could create 
more sustainable methods of live­
stock feeding and crop production, 
develop proper methods of manure 
and methane management, or enlist 
better grazing methods to prevent 
erosion, these improvements can only 
be implemented by industry heads. 
These leaders, more likely than not, 
are unwilling to act due to economic 
factors, and as a population we can­
not rely on them.
The ball is in our court — it is up 
to the people to take control of this 
situation. With no higher powers to 
take on the responsibility, the typical
Michelle Liu/Photo Staff
The meat-packing industry is known for its waste and inefficiency. Campus dining locations should encourage vegetarian and vegan 
eating options.
Carnegie Mellon student is the one 
who needs to make a difference. The 
solution is easy: Cut down on meat 
consumption.
By eating lower on the food chain, 
individuals can reduce the amount 
of land needed to support their exis­
tence, thus minimizing their ecologi­
cal footprint. If less land is cultivated 
for the production of crops or the 
grazing of livestock, that much more 
wilderness is left untouched. As a re­
sult there will be less soil erosion, less 
water pollution, less pesticide use, 
less carbon emission, and less energy 
use.
Even just cutting one’s meat con­
sumption in half can be a personally
healthy and seemingly effective way 
to minimize the impact of meat pro­
duction.
Predictably enough, however, ' a 
plant-based diet is the best alterna­
tive. Plants are healthy for the body, 
,and a proper vegetarian diet has 
proven effective in reducing heart 
disease, cancer, and other diet-relat­
ed diseases. However, while it may be 
the best solution, a society of vegetar­
ians is largely unrealistic.
Keeping reality in mind, this is a 
plea from me to the students of Car­
negie Mellon and the campus admin­
istration: Limit your meat consump­
tion. As an individual you can cut out 
that burger for an Evgefstos! alterna­
tive maybe once or twice a week; even 
this small initiative will make a differ­
ence. Meanwhile, Carnegie Mellon 
may consider instituting a day of the 
week where Resnik only serves ani­
mal-friendly products. You may even 
choose to do more to cut meat out for 
some period of time. Whatever you 
choose, get educated. Research the 
subject, discuss it with friends, browse 
the Internet — when considering 
your next eco-alternative, remember 
this article. Change is before us but no 
one is going to hand it over; it’s up to 
us to reach out and grab it.

Student government elections deserve campus participation
Welcome to not just the season 
for flooding from melting snow, 
but for a flooding of campus with a 
variety of flyers, posters, and post­
cards; campaigning friends clad in 
vibrantly colored shirts; and a bar­
rage of solutions to problems you 
probably didn’t know you had. Yes, it 
is student government election time, 
and I am here to remind you that you 
might actually care. Let’s start with 
four reasons why.
The administration listens.
Having been a ranking actor in 
student government for the past two 
years, I can confirm that Carnegie 
Mellon’s administration really does 
listen to students. And, as expected, 
when they have a question for which 
they want student input, student 
government is the first group they 
ask. The people you elect for the 
next year will truly be your voice in 
Warner Hall. Student representa­
tion and the way it factors into the 
administration’s decisions is almost 
impossible to quantify, but it is likely 
this same inexactitude that makes 
it so valuable. These four students
— student body president and vice 
president, vice president for finance, 
and vice president for organizations
— must be able to speak honestly 
and openly about the overall student 
experience.
These people control your money.
If intangible benefits are uncon­
vincing, let me provide an entirely 
quantifiable reason to vote. The $90 
student activities fee that you pay 
each semester is allocated through 
student government. It pays for 
most of the budget of nearly every 
student-run organization and event 
on this campus. The vice president 
of finance is responsible for chairing 
a committee whose task is to fairly 
distribute about $1.15 million to just 
under 200 recognized student orga­
nizations.
A new position is a new challenge.
For the first time we will elect a
student body vice president for orga­
nizations (VPO) — a person whose 
duties involve overseeing CoSO, the 
committee that decides which clubs 
are officially recognized by the uni­
versity, and acting as a voice and a re­
source for those organizations. While 
the intent is clear, the exact role is 
open to interpretation. The person 
who is elected to this position will 
likely set the tone for future VPOs, 
a significant responsibility. How we 
decide as a student body who is the 
best person for this position is, in my 
opinion, an open question.
This year you can vote.
Based on the student body con­
stitution changes that occurred ear­
lier this month, every student has 
the right to vote. If you are study­
ing abroad, you can vote. If you are 
a graduate student, no matter what 
point in your program you are at, you 
can vote. The days of Carnegie Mel­
lon poll taxes are over — every stu­
dent can vote.
We are just now at the beginning 
of the election cycle. Over the com­
ing weeks we will watch as students 
declare their candidacy; we will read 
their advertisements and learn their 
platforms. Shortly before the elec­
tion, The Tartan will host a debate to 
help everyone better understand and 
compare the competing platforms. 
And then on April 3, voting will be­
gin.
Last year less than 25 percent of 
the student body voted. This is not 
due to a lack of advertising on behalf 
of the Elections Board or the candi­
dates. It can’t be attributed to student 
government not being important 
enough to take the two minutes it 
takes to vote — I hope my arguments 
above show it is.
Yet, many might not yet realize 
the role student government serves. 
This has hopefully been somewhat 
remedied this year, with continuing 
programs like the Loop Bus and the 
new Tartan Rewards Program and 
Textbook Flea Market, not to men­
tion student government’s active 
leadership in rallying against the 
mayor’s tuition tax.
To potential candidates, I encour­
age you to talk to current leaders
and involved students, and find out^, - 
which issues are important to cam^M 
pus and present solutions to them.;'
I encourage you to be specific and - 
realistic. Don’t tell me there are “im­
portant issues” — tell me what the is­
sues are and suggest ways you might 
fix them. Student government is not 
all-powerful, not even close.
Candidates that can focus on a 
small number of actually achievable 
goals which are relevant to the com­
munity will draw attention to their 
platform and their campaign, and 
will get votes.
Elections are an enjoyable and ex­
citing time for me, not just because 
this snow is going to melt and it will 
begin to feel like spring, but because 
new motivated and passionate stu*„- 
dents will step up with plans to make; * 
this university a better place. That; ! 
competitive, optimistic spirit embod-*"*

Good luck, and I will see you at

Tartans battled top teams at 
ITA National Championships
TENNIS, from A10
win by first-year Duke Miller 
and sophomore Jeremy King 
at number three, the Tartans 
continued to play strong to 
take five of the six singles 
matches.
Notable wins came from 
Muliawan at number three, 
who won 6-0, 6-4, and Rao, 
who won in straight sets, 6-4, 
6-4.
Despite the win in the con­
solation semifinals, the day 
wasn’t over just yet for the
Tartans, who went head-to- 
head against Johns Hopkins 
for fifth place. After a close 
loss by King and Miller, 7-9, 
and a win by Nemerov and 
MacTaggart at second dou­
bles, 8-2, the Tartans found 
themselves down 1-2. Senior 
Jonathan Spero brought in 
the first singles point at fifth 
singles, 6-1, 6-4, followed 
by Rao, winning 6-3, 6-3, 
and Muliawan, 4-6, 6-4,1-0. 
Carnegie Mellon fell short, 
though, and was unable to se­
cure a fifth point for the win.
The Tartans took sixth overall 
in the tournament.
“This was the first time we 
were ever invited to the tour­
nament, so we did okay for 
a first-time run,” Muliawan 
noted. “Obviously we wanted 
to do better, but there’s noth­
ing we can do now except 
work harder and prepare 
for our spring break trip and 
NCAAs.”
The Tartans will gear up 
again against Christopher 
Newport College on Tuesday, 
March 2 at home.

On Saturday, Feb. 20, 
Carnegie Mellon’s track and 
field team journeyed to Alli­
ance, Ohio to participate in 
the Raider Open hosted by 
Mount Union College. Both 
the men’s and women’s teams 
dominated the invitational, 
with Tartans taking top places 
in many events.
For the men’s team, the 
Tartans met with success on 
the field, with senior Chris 
Bridgman taking third in the 
pole vault, clearing a Season 
best height of 4.40 meters. 
In the high jump, sophomore 
Ryan Kissell earned fourth 
with a height of 1.78 meters. 
Kissell also scored sixth in the 
long jump with a season re­
cord of 6.46 meters.
Senior James Hulley won 
the shot put, clearing 15.88 
meters, and earned second 
in the weight throw, reach­
ing 15.54 meters. Teammate 
senior Chris Fornataro was 
not far behind in the weight 
throw, clearing 14.54 me­
ters, which earned him fourth 
place.
On the track, the men im­
pressed the competition. In 
the 3000-meter run, junior 
J.R Allera won and set a meet 
record of 8:51.70. Allera was 
closely followed by sopho­
more Rob Morhard, who took 
third in the event in 8:57.91. 
Junior Nate Bussiere grabbed 
second in the mile, finishing 
in 4:19.37.
When it came down to 
the relays, the Tartan’s talent 
shined through. The men took 
first in the 4x200-meter relay, 
with a team of first-year John 
Caverhill, sophomore Michael 
Moore, junior Dustin Mussel- 
man, and first-year Noel Ti­
tus, finishing in 1:34.85. In 
addition, Bussiere, Caverhill, 
first-year Ben Nealy, and ju­
nior Pat O’Brien joined forces 
to win the 4x400-meter relay, 
in a time of 3:29.91.
The women’s team put on 
an equally impressive perfor­
mance. On the field, sopho­
more Ivana Moses placed fifth 
in the long jump, clearing a 
distance of 4.70 meters. She
also finished fourth in the 
triple jump, leaping 10.71 
meters. Sophomore Luci Laf- 
fitte finished fifth in the high 
jump, clearing 1.55 meters.
The women continued to 
dominate on the track. Laf- 
fitte also finished third in the 
55-meter hurdles with a per­
sonal record of 8.98 seconds. 
First-year Emily Wobb won 
the mile in 5:33.84, while ju­
nior Courtney Baker took first 
in the 800-meter run, finish­
ing in 2:27.57. Not far behind 
were teammates senior Diane 
Mattingly and junior Laura 
McKee, who earned third and 
fourth with times of 2:27.57 
and 2:28.04, respectively.
Like the men’s team, the 
ladies found success in their 
relay. Baker, Laffitte, McKee, 
and senior Sami Simmons 
teamed up to finish second in 
the 4x400-meter relay, with a 
time of 4:14.57.
Look for the Tartans on 
March 5-6, as they partici­
pate in the 2010 University 
Athletic Association Indoor 
Championships at Brandeis 
University.

third-place finish in the 200- 
yard butterfly with a time 
of 1:52.43 en route to being 
crowned UAA Male Rookie of

“Honestly, winning Rookie 
of the Year was the last thing 
on my mind,” said Glaser-Gar­
brick. “I just went in there do­
ing what I do, showing what
I’m made of, and I’m glad I 
was able to turn some heads.”
Also in the 1650, Winkler

Moorby and Dahlen finished 
first and second in the con­

1:52.39 and 1:52.88.
Moorby’s time would have 
made him the UAA champion 
had he made the champion­
ship final during preliminar­
ies. Mathews placed first in 
the consolation final with a 
time of 46.90 in the 100-yard 
freestyle. Huber also placed

of the 200-yard breaststroke 
touching in with a time of
2:09.44.

Alexovich placed third in the 
one-meter board and Kuhn

the event in 3:06.20.
“It was definitely a great

“Though We didn’t get as close 
to Emory as last year, we still 
had a lot of great individual 
performances and I think we 
really set the stage to do some­
thing amazing next year.”

Men’s tennis takes 6th at ITA Indoor National Championships, tops #25 Gustavus Adolphus
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports Editor
For the first time in Car­
negie Mellon’s history, the 
men’s tennis team was in­
vited to participate at the ITA 
National Team Indoor Cham­
pionship, held at Gustavus 
Adolphus College. After fall­
ing to number-one Santa 
Cruz in the first round, the 
Tartans rebounded to defeat 
number-25 Gustavus Adol­
phus 8-1, but were unable to 
repeat and fell to number-six 
Johns Hopkins 4-5 later that 
evening to finally take sixth. 
The ninth-ranked Tartans 
move to 6-3 for the season.
In the opening round, the 
Tartans faced top-ranked 
Santa Cruz, but fell 4-5 af­
ter many close matches. The 
Banana Slugs proved to be 
tough in the doubles round 
of play and took a 2-1 lead 
heading into singles. The duo 
of juniors Alex Nemerov and 
Bobby MacTaggart took the 
lone point at second doubles, 
winning 9-8 (6).
In singles play, the remain­
ing three points came from 
MacTaggart, who won play­
ing the second singles spot,
3-6, 6-2, 1-0 (4), followed 
by senior James Muliawan 
playing number three, 7-5,
4-6, 1-0 (3), and first-year 
Harsha Rao, 7-5, 7-5.
“This was disappointing, 
because we’ve been working 
very hard and we thought 
we might have been able to 
pull off an upset,” Nemerov 
said. “But Santa Cruz played 
well, and we just want to fo­
cus on winning the next two 
matches.”
“We lost 4-5 to the num- 
ber-one team, so it’s not like 
we were overwhelmed,” 
MacTaggart added. “We defi­
nitely have a couple things to 
work on, but this only shows 
that we can play at the top 
level too.”
The Tartans found better 
luck against the host team 
Gustavus Adolphus and deci­
sively won 8-1. After sweep­
ing the doubles to take a 3-0 
lead, including a brutal 8-0

This week, Carnegie Mel­
lon’s men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving team 
traveled to Atlanta for the 2010 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) Championships, hosted 
by Emory University. Overall, 
the men’s team finished the 
weekend in second place, and 
the women finished fourth.
The women’s swimming 
and diving team opened the 
meet on Thursday by setting 
a school record in the 200- 
yard freestyle relay. Sopho­
more Hannah Gonzalez led 
off the relay with teammates 
first-year Breanna Stillo, se­
nior Sara Andrews, and junior 
Brianne Burton finishing the 
race with a school record and 
NCAA provisional qualifying 
time of 1:37.70.
Burton, Stillo, and An­
drews also swam the 50-yard 
freestyle, with Burton swim­
ming a provisional qualifying 
mark placing fifth with a time
of 24.28. Stillo won the con­
solation final in 24.52, and 
Andrews finished fourth in the 
consolation final with a time 
of 24.99. Junior Molly Evans 
earned a season-best time in 
the 500-yard freestyle, finish­
ing in second place with a time 
of 5:00.31. Sophomore diver 
Olivia DeFazio placed fourth 
on the one-meter board. The 
women’s team was ranked 
fourth after day one at the 
UAA Championships.
The men started off the 
meet well, finishing the day in 
second place behind Emory. 
Senior Gates Winkler became 
the UAA champion in the 500- 
yard freestyle with a time of 
4:34.20, finishing almost two 
full seconds ahead of junior 
teammate and silver medalist 
Frank Olechnowicz. The Tar­
tans showed even more depth 
in the 500, as first-years Kevin 
Kuntz and Brandon Yee took 
fourth and fifth, respectively, 
and all four Tartans achieved 
NCAA provisional cuts. Senior 
Jonas Altman-Kurosaki won
the consolation heat in the 
500, while teammate senior 
Jon Spring touched in fifth in 
the same event with a time of 
4:44.68.
The men’s A’ 200-yard free­
style relay, consisting of junior 
Josh Mathews, senior Scott 
Moorby, junior Travis Piper, 
and sophomore Matt Stanton 
placed fifth with a time of 
1:25.63. Junior Alex Hanson 
took fourth in the 200-yard IM 
with a provisional mark and 
a career-best time of 1:54.84. 
First-year Daniel Glaser-Gar- 
brick also swam the 200-yard 
IM, finishing third in the con­
solation final in 1:55.91. Se­
nior Jeff Dahlen finished third 
in the 50-yard freestyle with 
a career mark with a time of 
21.29. The 400-yard medley 
relay of Dahlen, senior Jeff 
Huber, Glaser-Garbrick, and 
Mathews finished second, 
and Dahlen’s lead-off 100- 
yard backstroke time of 50.93 
will most likely send him to 
NCAAs.
For the men’s diving team,
sophomore Mike Alexovich 
earned All-UAA honors with a 
third-place finish in the three- 
meter board while senior Matt 
Kuhn finished fifth.
“It was great to start off the 
meet strong,” Huber said. “We 
had to get the bugs out a bit in 
the morning but really came 
together at night and got in 
the right mindset.”
On day two, the women’s 
team racked up four different 
"NCAA provisional times. The 
200-yard medley relay team 
of first-year Dorothy Yu, Stillo, 
Evans, and Burton set a school 
record by almost two seconds 
with its second-place time 
of 1:47.62, and Evans placed 
third in the 200-yard freestyle 
with a time of 1:53.10. Stillo 
and Andfews also each provi­
sionally qualified for the NCAA 
meet in the 100-yard breast­
stroke, with Stillo placing third 
with a 1:06.80 and Andrews 
finishing fourth with a time 
of 1:07.34. The 800-yard free­
style relay team of Andrews, 
first-year Sarah Musial, Evans,
and sophomore Victoria Ad­
ams placed third with a time 
of 7:47.04 and earned All-UAA 
honors. Gonzalez placed sixth 
in the 100-yard butterfly with 
a time of 59.47 as the women 
Tartans held their fourth place 
at the end of Friday’s competi­
tion.
“I thought we had a lot of 
inspiring races,” said Gonza­
lez. “Nothing gets people more 
pumped up than watching 
their teammates do something 
amazing.”
The Tartan men won two 
more events and remained in 
second place on the second 
day of swimming. Hanson 
won the 400-yard individual 
medley with a personal best 
of 4:02.60, a provisional mark 
that will likely send him to 
the NCAA Championships. 
Moorby won his event in the 
100-yard backstroke and so­
lidified his first trip to the 
NCAA Championships with an 
automatic qualifying time of 
50.69 before leading off the 
200-yard medley relay with an
outstanding split of 23.66.
Other top performers 1 for 
day two were Glaser-Garbrick, 
whose time of 4:06.75 in the 
400-yard IM garnered him 
seventh place, and Mathews, 
who earned All-UAA honors 
in the 200-yard freestyle with 
a third place time of 1:42:73. 
Both the 200-yard medley re­
lay consisting of Moorby, Hu­
ber, Piper, and Dahlen and the 
800-yard freestyle relay with 
the team of Dahlen, Kuntz, 
Mathews, and Olechnowicz 
placed second in their events, 
with times of 1:33.86 and 
6:05.27, respectively. The lat­
ter was out-touched by 0.01 
seconds by Emory.
The women ended the 
meet strongly on Saturday, as 
Evans became the two-time 
champion in the 200-yard 
backstroke with a season-best 
time of 2:04.29. Adams swam 
a season-best with a time of 
17:45.59 in the 1650-yard free­
style, finishing 12th but provi-

Women’s basketball falls short to the University of Chicago, 47-76

The Tartans traveled to 
play the University of Chicago 
on Friday and were unable 
to top the number-25-ranked 
Maroons, losing 47-76. The 
loss puts Carnegie Mellon at 
9-14 overall and 2-10 in the 
University Athletic Associa­
tion.
Carnegie Mellon kept the 
game close for the first three 
minutes of play, only trailing 
by one. However, over the 
next six minutes, Chicago’s
defense shut the Tartans 
down and extended their lead 
to 25-15 with 8:08 left in the 
half. Carnegie Mellon did 
not go down without a fight, 
however, and went on an 8-2 
run, which cut the deficit to 
27-23. A banked-in three- 
pointer from a Chicago guard 
ended the half, pushing the 
Maroons’ lead to 32-25.
Chicago started the second 
half full steam ahead, pushing 
its lead to 44-26 with 14:52 
left in the game.
The Maroons expanded 
the Tartans’ deficit even fur­
ther, to 52-27, before the 
Tartans scored their first field 
goal: sophomore guard Alison 
Aunkst’s trey from the top of 
the key.
Carnegie Mellon’s 21.4 
percent shooting from three- 
point range and 31.5 percent 
from the floor was not enough 
to top Chicago’s 46.4 percent 
from the floor. Chicago took 
the 76-47 victory.

ily Peel scored a career-high 
16 points. Aunkst added 10,

The men’s basketball team 
hit the road on Friday to play 
at the University of Chicago 
for the second time in its Uni­
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) season. The Tartans 
were unable to top the Ma­
roons, losing 63-74. Carnegie 
Mellon is now 5-15 overall 
and 1-11 in the UAA.
Chicago took the early 
lead, 8-2, within the first two 
minutes of the game, but the
Tartans stepped up their de­
fense to hold Chicago to one 
field goal over the next 11:30. 
The Tartans tied the score at 
14-14.
Carnegie Mellon took a 
26-21 lead after sophomore 
guard John Duhring scored a 
transition basket off an assist 
from junior forward Shane 
Rife. The Tartans then took 
their largest lead, 29-23, 
when Rife hit a three-pointer 
from the top of the key. Chi­
cago answered back with a 
halftime buzzer-beater, end­
ing the half with only a one- 
point Tartan lead, 29-28.
Chicago stole Carnegie 
Mellon’s lead with 16:32 left 
to play, but the Tartans sank 
10 straight points to take 
back the lead, 44-36, with 
14:35 left. Senior forward Jon 
Wolleben added six points 
during the run. Carnegie Mel­
lon then extended its lead to 
52-40, but could not hold off 
a 13-0 run by the Maroons. 
Chicago took the lead, 53-52.

Kurp goes the distance
SARA WINGEN
Staffwriter
While it may seem 
impossible to even think 
about track and field with 
the stadium covered in 
a thick blanket of snow, 
the men’s and women’s 
teams have been making 
moves indoors. Notably, 
unior middle-distance 
ner Justin Kurp fin- 
hed third at his last 
eet in the 1000-meter 
a great feat in the 
äst of the indoor sea­
son and in preparation 
for indoor champion­
ships and the upcoming 
outdoor season.
While in high school, 
Kurp qualified for com­
petition at the state 
level in both track and 
cross country, break­
ing a few school records 
and maintaining straight 
A’s throughout his high 
school career. Although 
he was also involved 
with baseball, Kurp rec­
ognized his strength in 
running and decided- to 
stick with it as his prima­
ry sport and passion.
Being from Pitts­
burgh, Kurp notes piero- 
gies, the Steelers, the
Penguins, and — jok­
ingly — the city’s street- 
plowing abilities as some 
of his favorite aspects of 
the city. Kurp regards 
the “Walking to the Sky” 
statue as being a unique 
and interesting part of 
Carnegie Mellon’s cam­
pus, and admits that he 
tends to like it more since 
some students expressed 
their dislike toward the 
structure.
Kurp is majoring in 
mechanical engineer­
ing and intends to go to 
graduate school after 
graduating next year. Be­
ing an engineer and mak­
ing a positive impact on 
society is one of Kurp’s 
goals for the future. For 
now, Kurp hopes to have 
a positive impact dur­
ing the track season and 
that his teammates will 
be on board. “It’s great 
when everyone’s heart is 
in the game, and I’d like 
to see that happen,” he 
said. With the end of the 
indoor season approach­
ing, and the anticipation 
of the outdoor season 
building up, the Tartans 
have some time to team 
up and make Kurp’s no­
tions a reality.

Audiences get a Closer look at love Everything you need to know
Scotch’n'Soda’S latest show explores the complications of romance About drama girls and deep-rooted crushes
Last weekend, Scotch’n'Soda put on three 
performances of Closer, a play by Patrick Marber that 
premiered in London in 1997 and was later adapted 
into a screenplay for the 2004 film of the same 
name. The play follows two men and two women 
who engage in a constant, yet believable, swapping 
of partners as they dance along the tightrope that 
is the truth. Each character adds his or her own 
level of deceit, in both playful and ugly ways, until 
relationships simply become a complicated mess 
where no one is able to leave emotionally unscathed.
The, film version of Closer consisted of a star- 
studded cast of some of Hollywood’s finest actors. 
Julia Roberts (Anna), Natalie Portman (Alice),
Jude Law (Dan), and Clive Owen (Larry) — who 
actually starred in the original stage production as 
Dan —* received much praise for their work in the 
vulgar yet articulate adaptation of stage to the big 
screen. Portman and Owen even won Golden Globes 
for their roles in the movie.
The Scotch’n’Soda production of Closer stood up 
nicely against the film adaptation. Senior biology 
major Michelle Stewart (Alice), senior BHA student 
Shannon Deep (Anna), senior music major Scott 
Wasserman (Dan), and senior computer science 
major Matt Goldfarb (Larry) gave wonderful and 
distinctively different performances as the four leads 
whose intricate relationships bring them closer 
together than they ever intended to be.
Stewart’s performance as Alice was unique. Alice 
was by far the most lovable character due to her 
quirky and simplistic nature. Stewart brought 
out each and every trait in a believable way, even 
managing to do so when she was half naked on 
stage. Our other leading lady, Shannon Deep, did 
a fantastic job of playing the more mature and 
seemingly in-control Anna. When she was in a 
scene, the dialogue just seemed to flow much 
better and it felt like the cast was having realistic 
conversations on stage rather than merely delivering 
lines.
The most important part of the show was the 
dynamic in each of the one-on-one relationships that 
take place throughout the course of the play. The 
actors brought out some of the best parts of each 
other, be it the puppy love shown between Alice 
and Dan, the maturity between Larry and Anna who 
know what they want, or even the links connecting 
the couples. The most interesting plot point was the 
spiteful way in which each character treated the 
others at different parts of the show.
Such a well-known and well-respected film obviously 
brings challenges to those who attempt to replicate 
it. Director Caity Pitts spoke briefly about some of
what she faced after choosing this project. "I told 
them to let the material speak for itself and I didn't 
want them to just go out and mimic the famous Jude 
Law or Natalie Portman,” she said. “I really wanted 
them to make it their own and make it more realistic 
for the audience."

Scotch 'n 'Soda's next show will be its annual Carnival 
show, with Alex DiClaudio directing Dirty Rotten 
Scoundrels, a comedy.

Closer explored the complications of the modern 
day webbed romance, as all of the characters are 
romantically involved with one another.
I’m looking for a new 
girlfriend. I’ve noticed 
that all the drama girls 
are much more attractive 
than the girls in my major; 
however, talking to them 
makes me want to vomit. 
What should I do? Is it 
okay to date someone for 
strictly physical reasons?
Sincerely,
—Looking for Own Leading 
Lady
Dear LOLL,
First of all, there are many 
attractive girls in every major 
at Carnegie Mellon. But you 
shouldn’t pursue girls just 
because they’re attractive. 
You need to find a girl you 
enjoy talking to, one you’re 
genuinely interested in. 
You can’t have any real 
connection or happiness 
with another person based 
on looks alone.
Okay, that should satisfy 
the womenfolk. They’ve 
probably stopped reading by 
now. Here’s what you gotta 
do: The next time you’re in 
a conversation with a drama 
major, just nod, smile, and 
repeat her name often. They 
only listen for their name and 
to the tone of your voice. 
While she’s talking, amuse 
yourself by doing some math 
problems in your head. Show 
her who the real actor is by 
looking interested.
Or if this doesn’t work, just 
break out the good old 
binoculars and find a good 
vantage point.
Sincerely,
—Brian Hoskins
Help me please! I have a 
crush on a friend of mine, 
but he’s totally oblivious. 
I’ve been after this guy for 
months now and nothing 
has seemed to work. 
Granted, I have yet to 
outright tell him that I’m 
interested, but I’m afraid 
of making the first move. 
What should I do?
Sincerely,
—Fear Really Approaching 
Interest for Date
Dear FRAID,
Why exactly are you talking 
to me? Of all the guys there 
are, there’s really only one 
you should be having this 
conversation with — your 
crush. I know you may 
be worried that if he turns 
you down you’ll ruin your 
friendship, but if you put in 
the effort that won’t happen.
It will be awkward at first, 
but over time it’il get back to 
normal. That may sound bad, 
but it’s better than spending 
your time pining away for 
some guy that doesn’t know 
any better. Maybe he feels the 
same about you, but like you, 
is too afraid to say anything.
This is the 21st century — 
don’t be afraid to be the one 
to start something. Guys 
like a little initiative. Or you 
could just start collecting his 
toenails.
Sincerely,
—Patrick Hoskins

Tales from abroad: Shanghai
One student finds her voice and the value of her heritage while studying overseas
Of course, touring China was not my main objective 
when I decided to study abroad this summer. My 
main motive was to improve my Chinese reading, 
writing, and speaking skills. By taking Chinese 
class every day of the week for hours at a time, I 
think I definitely improved my reading and writing 
skills. What helped my speaking the most was 
interacting with people in the streets, bargaining 
with salespeople, and in general, just being in 
China. I agree with the thought that if you really 
want to leam a language well, you should go to 
the country and live there for a couple months 
and immerse yourself in the language. I am glad 
that I went to China because I did what I went 
there to do: improve my Chinese.
Before my trip, I would rarely speak out in 
Chinese, because even though I understood 
the language pretty fluently, I was not able 
to fogm the sentences in my head quickly 
enough. I always had to think of a response 
in English, translate it in my head to Chinese, 
and then finally attempt to say it out loud. To
Last summer, I studied abroad in Shanghai, China for 
approximately two months. Other than suffering from 
Facebook withdrawal, all in all, China was definitely a 
good study abroad experience for me.
Even though I am an American, I was able to explore 
China much more discreetly as a tourist than most 
Americans would have. I am a Chinese heritage 
student, so physically, I look just like a typical Chinese 
citizen. This made touring the country much easier. 
Caucasian students fascinated the Chinese and most 
heads would turn at the sight of them. This part I was 
happy to miss out on, since I am not keen on extra 
attention from strangers. Some locals would even take 
pictures of them, some with their permission, others 
without. For my personal preference, I was glad that
I was able to tour different parts of China without 
drawing too much attention.
Even Asians that were not Chinese were drawn out. 
Most American people cannot tell a Chinese person 
apart from a Korean person or a Japanese person. 
However, most Asians can tell different ethnicities 
apart. One of my Korean classmates was just walking 
along a shopping street when one of the salesmen 
started talking to her in Korean to try to get her to 
buy his products. In general, because I am ethnically 
Chinese, it made bargaining a lot easier since 
salespeople did not assume that I was foreign. Once 
bargainers know that their customer is foreign, they will 
automatically bump up the price unnecessarily high. 
This makes bargaining a hard-earned skill, which can 
end in feeling very satisfied if you are able to get a good 
deal.
be honest, I was a little ashamed that my speaking 
was so broken, since I grew up in a Chinese-speaking 
family. One of my experiences in China exemplified 
these feelings completely. I was in a taxi, on my way to 
some tourist spot, when the taxi driver tried to make 
conversation with my classmates and me. He could tell 
that I was ethnically Chinese, and he questioned why I 
still had to learn Chinese. He told us a story about how 
his nephew, who grew up in Kentucky, was able to 
speak Chinese fluently and asked why I could not do the 
same. I was not sure how to answer this question. After 
that encounter, it made me even more motivated to 
learn to speak, read, and write fluently in Chinese.
This trip was a mixture of realizing my shortcomings , 
as a non-fluent Chinese heritage student and 
experiencing what it feels like to live in China on 
my own. I was pushed to improve my Chinese
by myself and by a simple conversation with a taxi 
driver. At the same time, I was also able to explore my 
Asian roots, through lessons of history and touring the 
country. Overall, my experiences in China proved to be 
extremely beneficial; I was able to truly unveil a whole 
new part of myself.

Bryce Avary uplifts listeners with his band’s newest release
Nick Guesto I Photo Staff
The Rocket Summer debuts its newest album, Of Men and Angels, repeating popular cheerful themes
It takes a lot to put an album together. From writing 
lyrics to orchestrating all the music to producing songs 
in full, it’s undoubtedly a big task for anyone involved. 
Now imagine that you — and you alone — are in charge 
of all three of these jobs. For Bryce Avary, it’s just another 
day at the office.
Avary is the brains and the brawn behind The Rocket 
Summer, a piano- and guitar-driven pop-rock solo project 
that’s been flying under the radar for the past couple of 
years. After releasing three full-length albums and four 
EPs, The Rocket Summer unveils its latest release, Of 
Men. and Angels, this Tuesday.
The album’s opening track, “Roses,” wastes no time 
easing you into the musical and lyrical themes of the 
remaining songs. Starting off energetically and singing 
lyrics like “And I believe I'll move the mountains,” Avary 
proves to listeners that he is not afraid to make bold 
statements.
The Rocket Summer’s first single off the new album is 
entitled "Walls.” To no surprise, the song is uplifting and 
hopeful, declaring, "I’ll help you break the walls down; 
and bust you out and take you home; believe in me, you 
are not alone.”
Sometimes, Avary intentionally presents an ambiguity in 
his songs as to whether they have Christian meanings. 
However, there is no doubt that the title track of this new 
album was written about God. The song starts off with 
a soft piano, then builds up to a powerful chorus with 
Avary proclaiming, “Here I am dear Lord, tasting hints 
of fame, and I don’t want it anymore if it's not you that 
I gain.” This song is an example of Avary clandestinely 
criticizing many artists in today’s music business. Citing 
an earlier song, "A Song Is Not a Business Plan” off The 
Rocket Summers’s 2007 release Do You Feel, Avary often 
writes about modern popular musicians: “This is me 
saying words I actually mean; I won’t compromise this 
thing just to make it.”
“Hills and Valleys” is a strongly piano-driven song, 
recounting the early days when the band traveled 
cross-country while living out their dream, a lyrical 
theme similar to The Rocket Summer’s previous tune 
also off Do You Feel titled “Colors."
The interestingly named “Japanese Exchange Student" 
shows Avary’s ability to use light-hearted lyrics to 
explain a serious issue. At one time, he sings "The thrill 
wears off, and then I’m alone," while later he urges “So 
be nice to the Japanese exchange student.” Upon first 
listen, the song might seem a bit depressing, talking 
about loneliness and not fitting in, but Avary isn’t a fan 
of negative vibes and by the song’s finish, listeners are 
left with a feel-good story.
"Tara, I'm Terrible" is a stripped-down song, with only 
vocals and an acoustic guitar. Lyrically, it goes off the 
road that Avary usually walks. Musically, it’s produced 
very differently from the other tracks on Of Men and 
Angels, as well as from his previous releases.
“Let You Go” is another piano-driven song with 
optimistic lyrics that affirm the relationship that 
Avary has with someone special. Unlike what the title 
suggests, Avary claims that he will not let that special 
someone go, and he provides more optimism and cheery 
words to his friend, saying, “I hope the new grass you 
seek is greener than the greenest green.”
At about two and a half minutes into the closing song, 
“Light,” the music really picks up and assumes the role 
of a grand finale; then, after the energetic moments, 
it gradually fades into a softer melody. With this 
conclusion, Avary has lifted us up, brought us along an 
inspirational journey, and slowly brought us back home.
One of the most important parts of the album isn't even 
contained on the disc: It’s the cover. Avary explained 
how the cover art reflects the overall theme of his latest 
release in an interview with www.altpress.com, saying,
"I wanted to illustrate a moment that showed someone 
leaning up against a wall pondering, perhaps focusing 
on the problems of life, but unbeknownst to this person, 
on the other side of the wall is an angel blocking so 
much trouble from him." It deals with the times when 
life isn't so kind to us, but there might be more to the 
problems that we can’t even see. He added, "You have to 
remain hopeful and faithful throughout trials even when 
it can be hard to.”
If you’ve been a fan of The Rocket Summer in the past, 
then you most definitely will not be disappointed with 
Of Men and Angels, as Avary uses a musical formula 
that has proven successful in the past. .Sure, the new

album may seem repetitive if you allow it to be, as the 
amount of instrumentation in each song is limited and 
there are frequent familiar lyrical themes; however, if you 
choose to look at each song as a piece of art, by itself, 
you’ll see that each uplifting story is a gem. These songs 
have their own independent value that, as is most likely 
Avary’s intent with his music, will make you smile.

One student talks about the benefits of her semester spent exploring Washington, D.C.
and upon completion of 640 hours I will be eligible for 
noncompetitive conversion to a full-time employee when 
I graduate. This alone justified my going to D.C. for the 
semester because I gained connections, and even a 
potential career, that I would not have otherwise.
My internship, though, did not make up my entire 
experience in D.C. The city itself was a great experience: 
seeing the sights, going to sporting events and 
museums, and realizing more and more every day 
that I wanted to work for the federal government in 
some way. I lived in an apartment on Capitol Hill, run 
by Washington Intern Student Housing (WISH). The 
location and ability to become more independent gave 
me an even greater experience.
The public law program through American gave me 
both professional preparation and memories that I could 
never forget. The setting of the program was different 
from that of a traditional class. We were required to dress 
professionally every day, and we were encouraged to 
write and speak more professionally. We were hardly 
even in a classroom, instead constantly traveling 
throughout the city to see sights and meet professionals 
or observe the proceedings within the sites. Each day 
provided a novel learning experience that could not be 
provided anywhere but in our nation's capital.
My class met a representative from the National Rifle 
Association and a representative from the Brady Center 
for Gun Control. They provided two very different 
perspectives on the Second Amendment. They gave me 
a greater understanding of both sides of the gun control 
issue, and also made me better able to develop my own 
opinion on this controversial issue.
We also met Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm 
Stewart, Clerk of Supreme Court William Suter, 
Congressman James McGovern, attorneys in the DC.
Office of the Attorney General, and the chief judge of 
both the D.C. District Court and the Federal Appellate 
Court.
We also met with additional members of Congress:
Jim McDermott, Pete Sessions, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 
Betsy Mar key, Anthony Weiner, Bill Delahunt, Mary 
Bono Mack, and Bobby Scott. We also met Senator 
Richard Burr and Congressman John Conyers, who 
is also chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
We got to watch the closing arguments of the Kevin 
Ring trial, (He was an actor in the Abramoff scandal.)
We met several more judges and attorneys, and the 
executives of the Boeing Company, the Recording 
Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture 
Association of America, Pepsico International, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Food 
and Drug Administration. Of course meeting the people 
mentioned was great, but learning about the different 
positions and administrations was an even greater 
experience. From of all of my experiences, the most vivid 
in my mind is meeting Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia and watching a Supreme Court argument.
Words cannot describe how amazing my time in D.C. 
really was. My experiences, though, aren't the only thing 
I took away from the Washington Semester Program.
I now know what direction I want my life to go in. I 
recently applied to the Heinz School for an accelerated 
master’s in public policy and management and am 
going back to D.C. this summer to continue working 
for the EPA to fulfill my SCEP hours requirement. Upon 
graduation I hope to return to the EPA full-time and 
move throughout the government. My decision to study 
in Washington, D.C. turned out to be one of the best and 
most influential decisions of my life.
Jessica Buranovsky | Special to The Tartan
During the past fall semester I decided to study in our 
nation’s capital, Washington, D.C., through American 
University and the Washington Semester Program 
here at Carnegie Mellon. As a Pittsburgh native and a 
Carnegie Mellon student, I had never been far away for a 
long period of time. Being away from home and leaving 
my teammates on the women’s basketball team were 
two of the hardest setbacks I had to consider before 
making my final decision to go.
This time a year ago, I began hearing information about 
the Washington Semester Program, and I decided to look 
into it a little more. As a public policy and management 
major, I figured there was no better place to go to see 
how I could put my major to use. I applied, got accepted, 
and was able to go with the help of a Friedman 
Fellowship that I had applied for and received.
The Washington Semester Program has an internship 
component you must complete during your time in D.C. 
The program I was in — public law — required two 
full days of internship experience a week. Though the 
Washington Semester Program guarantees placement 
in an internship, I wanted to gain some job searching 
experience. Over the summer, I began looking for an 
internship for my arrival in D.C. I applied with several 
members of Congress and governmental agencies. I have 
some interest in environmental policy, and I landed an 
internship with the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) in the Office of Pesticides, Prevention, and Toxic 
Substances.
My internship choice turned out to be a great one. 
The people I worked with were knowledgeable, and 
the experience was relevant to what I wanted as my 
career. At the end of my semester, my supervisor 
offered me a continuation of my internship during the 
summer. By doing this, I will be considered a member 
of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP),

Dear John translates a notable romance novel
Movie adaptation of Nicholas Sparks’ novel fails to convey the emotions of written word
For anyone familiar with the plotline, Dear John evokes 
from audiences exactly what’s expected: tears. Every 
movie based on a book by Nicholas Sparks seems 
to have this effect on viewers. Dear John is a movie 
adaptation of an extremely moving novel of the same 
name about young love beleaguered by complications. 
The relationship between the two lead characters is 
focused on bittersweet loss, but is softened by the 
sweet manifestation of the actors in a way that feels 
like triumph to the audiences. "Dear John" traditionally 
refers to the kind of letter written by a girl to a boy when 
she wants to break up and, therefore, the plotline of the 
movie is not all surprising.
The film, directed by Lasse Hallstrom, is based on the 
literary relationship between Special Forces soldier 
John (Channing Tatum) and college student Savannah 
(Amanda Seyfried), who meet in 2001 during his leave 
and her spring break on the coast of South Carolina.
The two characters, from extremely different parts of 
society, fall in love. While John is staying with his father,
Savannah is working on a project to build houses for the 
underprivileged over spring break. Soon enough, the 
break ends and John has to part ways with his lover. 
However, he plans to leave the service when his tour 
ends to be with Savannah, and this keeps their love 
and drive alive. They vow to keep in touch, write old- 
fashioned letters to each other, and gaze at the moon 
with the hope to meet again soon.
After the attacks on the World Trade Center, John feels 
it is his duty to re-enlist. The two exchange letters over 
the years as additional hurdles arise. Other characters 
include John's emotionally withdrawn, obsessive, coin­
collecting father (Richard Jenkins) and Savannah's best 
friend (Henry Thomas), whose son is autistic. However, 
the plot of the movie revolves around the relationship of 
Savannah and John. This relationship blooms through 
war and family issues.
This movie falls within the mediocre range of Sparks' 
various film adaptations. The attempt to bring a warm
feeling to the audience matches that of the book to 
an extent; however, it doesn’t do the book justice. 
Furthermore, these movies cannot be compared to the 
ability of movies such as The Notebook and A Walk to 
Remember to stir up emotions.
The relationship between Savannah and John and 
their likability is definitely one of the strengths of this 
movie. It would be hard for audiences not to wish that 
Savannah and John be together forever. If you enjoy 
movies based on novels by Sparks — with emotion and 
drama abounding — then this is a must-see. However, if 
not, this movie is sadly not worth watching — just read 
the book instead.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is the first animated 
feature directed by Wes Anderson, 
well-known for his detailed work 
in producing every aspect of his 
cinematic adventures. Based on the 
widely read children’s book of the same 
name by Roald Dahl, this flick stars the 
voices of George Clooney and Meryl 
Streep as foxes who steal food from 
neighboring farms and depicts the 
rough lives they live. The movie was 
well-received by critics and nominated 
for the Golden Globe for Best 
Animated Film, but lost to Up. Fun fact: 
The word “cuss” is used in the script 
as a replacement for actual swearing, 
which is pretty cute.
Airplane!
Saturday, Feb. 27

The Carnegie Aeronautical Association 
combines with AB to bring us Airplane!, 
one of the best comedies ever made.
In the film, we follow the leading 
characters’ hilarious antics aboard a 
flight from Los Angeles to Chicago, as 
passengers and crew fall ill after they 
eat a certain food item mid-flight. This 
masterpiece of comedic satire focuses 
on Ted Striker, an ex-fighter pilot, as he 
attempts to regain the love of his life 
via landing a plane he has no business 
flying, for countless hysterical reasons.
To borrow from one of the film’s best 
lines, surely you cannot be serious about 
not seeing this movie. Well, I am serious, 
and don’t call me Shirley.

If ‘The Man” killed your brother, used

and pushed bad malt liquor on

Nothing? Well, that doesn’t sit well 
with Black Dynamite, who serves 
justice the only way an ex-CIA agent 
knows how, with plenty of violence 
and amazing one-liners. Dubbed one 
of the best spoofs since Airplane!, 
Black Dynamite features several 
well-known black actors who perform 
comedic gold under their ridiculous 
aliases. Fun fact: “Because donuts 
don’t wear alligator shoes” is an 
actual line from the movie. Do you 
need any more reason to see it?

and crowd at Nakama. The bar is constantly bustling 
with people, most of them members of the young and 
trendy Pittsburgh culture. When dining with a date, I 
would definitely recommend sitting around the bar area. 
It is the perfect intimate place to get to know someone * 
over tasty food and great conversation. If dining with a 
big group and ordering wine, try the clean slate Riesling 
white wine. Being a Japanese restaurant, sake is also 
a good option. Nothing goes better with a heavenly 
Japanese meal than a shot of sake with your friends. 
Among the sushi, the spicy California roll, shrimp 
tempura roll, seared ahi tuna, yakitori, and the spicy tuna 
roll are definitely notable choices. Even the vegetarian 
sushi is mouth-watering with its fresh avocado and
crunchy asparagus. Excellent starter choices include 
the squid salad, seared tuna, cold noodles, and steak 
skewers. The steak skewers are especially good when 
dining with a large party; they are tender beef sticks 
marinated in spices and are perfect for finger picking.
For the main course, if sitting in the hibachi section, it 
is expected that one orders hibachi, and diners will not 
regret it. Sitting in a dimly lit room with total strangers 
may sound awkward, but nothing brings folks together 
better than the collective misuse of chopsticks. Whether 
it is the veggie delight, the sesame chicken, or the steak, 
watching one’s food being prepared, interacting with the 
chef, and enjoying the company of other diners makes 
for a unique experience.
The chefs first come out and introduce themselves.
They follow this introduction by demonstrating tricks 
with ingredients and fire from the hibachi grill. These 
specially trained chefs prepare all of the food right in 
front of their diners. They slice, dice, and julienne with 
lightning speed. All entrees, from sesame chicken to 
hibachi scallops, are served with a flambe, soup, and 
assorted sides. The hibachi.portions are huge; however, 
the drawback of the hibachi section is that diners have 
to pay $10 to share their food with their friends. The 
beginning price of a hibachi dish is around $16, but it 
can go up to about $55. However, the food and service at 
Nakama are definitely worth the price.
If celebrating a friend's birthday, this is definitely a great 
place for the occasion. At the end of a birthday dinner,
the Nakama staff comes out with a gong, sparklers, cake, 
and ice cream, making your celebration truly special.
The service at Nakama is extremely good and the staff 
is very attentive. The one drawback of this restaurant is 
the high price. Each person ends up paying $40 each if 
they order a couple of drinks, an appetizer, and a Hibachi 
dinner dish.
Despite the high price, this restaurant is definitely 
worth going to. After a meal, there are many bars and 
other great places located on East Carson Street to visit. 
Definitely make a reservation for the hibachi section 
beforehand because you may not be able to get a table 
by just walking in, especially on a weekend. Also, if you 
choose to dine late, you can definitely get a table after 
9:30 p.m. when the place slows down a notch, making 
it possible to move around. If you do get a reservation 
before 9:30 p.m., try to be on time, if not early.
Nakama is one of the best teppanyaki places in 
Pittsburgh-. It is simply not possible to go hungry and 
unsatisfied with a meal from Nakama. By the end of the 
meal, you and your friends will be clinking Buddha mugs 
and ordering another round of sake, having thoroughly 
enjoyed the meal.

Nakama is located at 1611 East Carson Street. You can

Student designers dazzle at Lunar Gala
The campus celebrated the Chinese New Year with a student-run fashion show
There is, in fact, no fashion design major here at Carnegie 
Mellon, but if you were around Wiegand Gym this 
Saturday you might have thought otherwise.
Saturday marked the 13th annual Lunar Gala, a 
celebration of the Chinese New Year. Students gathered 
to Watch a full-blown runway show featuring student 
models flaunting wearable student designs. The show 
was also accompanied by three dances and a musical 
interlude.
The theme chosen to celebrate the Year of the Tiger was 
“Tension.” Three traditional Chinese dances, performed 
by girls from the Oriental Star Dance School, kicked off 
the show. Act One consisted of eight student-designed 
lines, two professional boutique lines, a performance by 
the Dancers’ Symposium Company, and an original song 
performed by The Wrong Airport. Act Two also started 
with a dance, performed by Carnegie Mellon students.
Following the dance were seven student-designed lines, 
four professional boutique lines, and a second dance. 
Wiegand Gym was transformed into a fashion venue with 
the help of a long runway and black curtains to create a 
backdrop for the work. Lanterns, which changed colors 
throughout the show, added to the ambience and brought 
a touch of Chinese culture to the setting.
In the past, Lunar Gala has received criticism concerning 
the content of the show. This year’s show, however, was 
less risqué and more diverse in content. Although the 
only obvious links to Chinese culture were the initial 
dances, decorative lanterns, and dumplings that were 
served during intermission, the quality of the showcased 
work was impressive. The lines featured women’s and 
men’s clothing; there were casual pieces such as black 
pants and screen-print tees and formal pieces such as
evening gowns. Many of the outfits could be worn in 
everyday life, while other conceptual couture pieces 
made you wonder how long it would be until the model 
fell down. This year's show even featured a jewelry line, 
adding even more variety to the content.
The inspiration for the designs also brought diversity 
to the show. Music videos, military uniforms, and the 
Oakland streets during the G-20 had an influence on first- 
year design major Chris Ioffreda’s line, “Black." Bernard 
James’ self-titled line’s vision came from other sources. 
"My line was inspired by European royalty,” he said.
“I’m from New York City, so I went to the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art and did some research on French royalty.
I was inspired by the artists Piene-Paul Prud’hon 
and the way he draped and colored the subject’s 
clothing in his paintings."
The logistics of the show were also impressive.
Despite a few false starts, the opening was much 
improved over last year’s 40-minute delay, and 
there were no notable sound system problems. The 
crowded audience was assured a good view thanks 
to cmuTV and two large projectors showing the 
models walking the runway. Transitions between acts 
ran seamlessly. As James explained, “It was all very 
hectic but it all came together well. After a couple dress 
rehearsals the designers had all learned to work together
— to mesh." Although the show ran long, it focused 
largely on student designs.
Lunar Gala brings many parts of the campus 
community together in celebration of the-new year 
and student work. By virtue of the long lists of 
necessary thank yous, the collaboration that made 
the event possible was evident. “It was hectic 
but it was a lot of fun," said Marchelle Ecung, a 
sophomore business administration major and 
model for the show. “It’s a different experience 
than the norm here at CMU." In a school that 
is often thought of for its technical expertise,
Lunar Gala’s show of fashion and culture was 
a refreshing reminder of how diverse Carnegie 
Mellon's campus really is.

Midi music is on the rise
Get an early glimpse at this year’s upcoming indie music sensations
Expect big waves to be made this year in the indie 
music scene. 2009 was a year of creationism — 
genres were mixed, new synthetic sounds were 
discovered, and artists were as audacious and dicey 
as ever. From this spectacular year in music, we can 
only expect to see more benefits in 2010. Here is a 
list of some fresh contemporary artists who can be 
expected to rise to popularity and rule the 2010 indie 
music scene with an iron guitar.
Real Estate
This psychedelic midi-pop quartet hailing from 
Ridgewood, N.J. released their self-titled debut 
album, Real Estate, in November 2009. Popular 
songs from this first album like "Suburban Beverage” 
and “Snow Days” mix muted vocals with clean 
guitar to create an addictive summer sound similar 
to that of Girls and Beach House.
Often described as a component in the creation of 
the new sub-genre of lo-fi, Real Estate is actually 
considered to be a side project by its band members. 
Guitarist Mathew Mondanile previously recorded 
under the successful synth-pop alias Ducktails, while 
drummer Etienne Duguay was a member of a group 
known as Predator Vision. The band has recently 
been recording together in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Local Natives
Local Natives, a band formerly known as Cavil at 
Rest, released their debut album, Gorilla Manor, in 
the United States just last week to rave reviews.
The band first started to attract attention when they 
played at the South by Southwest music festival in 
Austin, Texas last year.
Popular songs like "Sun Hands” and “Camera 
Talk” feature intricate drums and hypnotic vocal 
harmonies that are often compared in quality to 
those of Fleet Foxes, a band that truly saw success 
in 2009. The five band members, who all share a 
home in Orange County, Calif., will soon embark on a 
worldwide tour playing small venues through Europe 
and the United States and hitting all the major indie 
music festivals. See www.thelocalnatives.com for 
show dates and news about the band. Let’s keep our 
fingers crossed for Pittsburgh!
Crystal Castles
After the 2008 debut of their self-titled album,
Crystal Castles became the obsession of open- 
minded indie bloggers everywhere, and fans have 
been eagerly awaiting the group's sophomore 
release. The electro duo, made up of vocalist Alice 
Glass and instrumentalist Ethan Kath, formed the 
band in 2003 in Ontario, Canada.
While this group has akeady seen a significant 
amount of success with their popular experimental 
electric tracks from their first album, fans have been 
raving about the group’s newest songs ever since 
they began playing them live. While no release date 
has been set and the album has yet to be named, 
some song names have been confirmed, including 
"Violent Dreams” and "Pap Smear.” Look for shows 
so that you too can hear a glimpse of this anticipated 
album, and keep your eyes peeled for any up and 
coming release news.
