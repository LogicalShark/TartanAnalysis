Election of Freshman Officers Will 
Be Held Today in AH Colleges
Plurality System Will Be 
Used To Select New 
Vice Presidents
PETITIONS ARE LISTED 
ON PAGE 4
Freshman elections, which are 
held in the fall within five weeks 
after registration, will be held in 
the colleges today from 11:30 to 
1:30. At the same time special re- 
elections will be held in the Col­
lege of Fine Arts and Margaret 
Morrison, to fill several vacancies 
created either by ineligibilities' or 
the failure of the officer-elect to 
register this fall.
Freshman ballots include nomin­
ations for president, secretary, and 
treasurer of the class in Margaret 
Morrison, Fine Arts, and Engineer­
ing and Industries. According to 
the plurality system of voting, the 
nominee for president who re­
ceives the second highest number 
of votes will be elected vice presi­
dent.
There will be one table in the 
College of Fine Arts, in Margaret 
Morrison, and in Engineering Hall. 
Students registered in the colleges 
of Engineering and Industries are 
reminded to vote in Engineering 
Hall, as only one set of officers 
will be elected for both colleges.
In the College of Fine Arts, a 
special e’ection will be held to fill 
the positions of president of the 
Senate, for which the entire school 
will vote; president of the junior 
class, and treasurer of the sopho­
more class.
Only the junior and senior 
classes of Margaret Morrison will 
vote in the re-election in that 
school. The vacancies to be filled 
are treasurer of the senior class, 
junior class Senate representative, 
and one assistant secretary of Stu­
dent Council ' (from the junior 
class).
The great amount of interest in 
today’s election is shown by the 
large number of candidates, and 
by the quantity of publicity mate­
rial the various candidates have 
had distributed among their re­
spective classmates. In Margaret 
Morrison three of the freshman 
candidates have pooled their efforts 
in an attempt to insure the elec­
tion of one another. One candidate 
in the same school has adopted a 
specific platform of her own which 
she advertises on a poster which 
bears an NRA sticker.
The politica’ly minded are also 
active in the other colleges. Many 
of the candidates have been cam­
paigning among their classmates, 
while others have had circulars 
and handbills printed for distribu­
tion.
Carnegie Women 
Meet to Discuss 
Social Questions
A Women’s Assembly will be 
held Tuesday at 11:30 in Margaret 
Morrison Recreation Hall to bring 
all the women of Carnegie togeth­
er to dicuss any questions of social 
convention that seem vague to 
them. Dean Green and Jean Rit- 
zel ’34 will be in charge of the as­
sembly.
Question boxes will be placed in 
the main halls of Margaret Morri­
son and Fine Arts Colleges, and 
all women having questions that 
they wish to be answered are re­
quested to place them in these 
boxes. The day before the assem- 
b'y is to be held these questions 
will be collected, assorted, and the 
most important ones given to some 
of the upperclass women. These 
women will find the proper an­
swers for the questions and pre­
sent both question and answer at 
the assembly. Miss Green will add 
any important information she may 
have on each answer and ask for 
responses from the audience.
It has been the custom to hold 
an assembly of this kind every 
four years, in order that each wo­
man attending Carnegie may have 
an opportunity of attending one 
during her four years at college.
irst Football Captain Recalls Early 
Days of Gridiron Sport at Carnegie
By HERBERT SCHWARZ
Carnegie football teams may be 
uiger and more widely known 
y than they were twenty-five 
s ago, but they don’t have 
ly as much fun as we used to 
said Fred Foster, captain 
the first Tech team, who re- 
ned to Carnegie last Friday to 
part in the Alumni Home-com-
The 1908 football team wasn’t 
jjy too successful, losing to Pitt, 
: to 0, and to West Virginia, 51 
0. The West Virginia game, 
ayed at Morgantown, W. Va., is
of the ones which Foster re-
-inbers most vividly. West Vir- 
¦ia had one of the best teams in 
east and all indications pointed 
an overwhelming victory.
Foster tried to get the home 
lIn to agree to a 15-minute in- 
ad of the regulation one-hour 
ne. But failing to do so, he
ght two quarts of something
h stronger than pink tea (he 
Idn’t say exactly what it was—
use your own judgement) and 
added it to the water in the water 
bucket without telling the rest of 
the team. Naturally the bucket 
was in great demand during the 
game, and it inspired the team so 
much that they held West Vir­
ginia to 51 points.
Don’t get the idea that the 1908 
players weren’t tough and ready 
to stand punishment. They were. 
The West Virginia and Pitt games 
were two of the three played in 
one week. One player was tough 
enough to come to a game, ready to 
play, holding his recently removed 
tonsils in his hand.
College teams played much 
rougher football twenty-five years 
ago than they do today, Foster re­
calls. During the West Virginia 
game one player, about to be sent 
in the game, astonished his team­
mates by saying, "Here, hold my 
teeth, I’m going in.”
In addition to being Carnegie’s 
first football captain, Foster was

Carnegie students defied the.

daring a school holiday in honor, 
of the Notre Dame victory.
At 8 o’clock Monday morning, 
students picketed the entranced to | 
the campus trying to persuade 
book-laden students that tligy 
should cut school and join a dem­
onstration to honor their football 
team. At 9:00 a crowd of five 
hundred students had gathered In 
front of the Administration Hall 
where Arthur Tarbell, Dean of 
Men, advlBed the group to return 
to classes.
Members of Student Council who 
were on the scene, aware by this 
time that the demonstration could 
not bo stopped, tried with some j 
success to form the group into an! 
orderly parade. The students start-! 
ed a march toward the bowl but 
changed their destination and con-j 
tinued past the men’s dormitories) 
and down Forbes street as far as 
the car shelter on the Carnegie 
Campds.
Student Council members at thi3
point convinced the ' group that 
they should return to the campus 
and they formed in front of the 
Senior Fence, cheering and sing­
ing.
Sis motorcycle policemen from 
the Pittsburgh police force were 
sent to escort the students in a pa­
rade down Forbes street as far as 
the boulevard overpass and back 
to the campus across the Panther 
Hollow Bridge.
The organized parade terminated, 
at 10:30 In front of the Gymna­
sium.

Council, and tho Interfraternity

Grads Celebrate 
Seventh Annual 
Home-Coming
Eighty Carnoglo alumni, mostly 
from tho 1908, 1913, 1018, 1028, 
and 1928 classos, registered with 
tho Alumni Olllco, and they, with 
many graduates who did not reg­
ister, enjoyed tho events which 
wore arranged for them during tho 
seventh annual Alumni Home-com­
ing, last Friday and Saturday.
Tho largest percentage of any 
class to return was tho 25 out of 
a total of 85 graduates of tho class 
of 1908. The members of this 
class and their wives or husbands 
were guests of President Baker at 
a luncheon given In Ills ofllco Fri­
day.
The 1908 graduates who were 
present included: W. II. Rieger,
F. E. Foster, D. F. Boyd, Charles 
A. Colmery, A. M. Cunnings, I-I. W. 
Gittens, Guy Halferty, Charles W. 
Hatch, J. I-I. Ilezlip, Harry L. Mc­
Kee, P. B. Martin, Bill Pfouts, 
Walter H. Pfril, L. D. Rigdon, W. 
M. Rinehart, Ida R. Sivitz, William 
i. Sivitz, Winthrop Slocum, J. C. 
Snyder, M. M. Steen, and Tracy 
W. TIngley.
The class of 1933, represented by 
Melvin Jones, added its plaque on 
Friday afternoon to those already 
placed in the main corridor of Ad­
ministration Hall. The Glee Club 
and members of M.ortar Board and 
Dragons, senior honorarles, repre­
sented the undergraduate body.
Stubborn Clansmen Are 
Masters of Irish; 
Score is 7 to 0
SKIBOS CLINCH GAME 
IN OPENING MINUTE
Lewis Catches Pass From 
Bevcvino After Green 
Fumble ICickoff
"All I iisk Is tliut I got inr 
dulios on tliut bull just once!" 
said Mr. Libbus Lewis of Little 
Washington last Thursday. Mr. 
Lewis did gel. his hands on the old 
apple just once, but that once was 
enough to send the haughty Green 
Ramblers of Notre Dame back to 
tlioir, lair In defeat. Lewis twisted 
a tendon in his leg on the play, but 
tho damage was done.
This 7-0 triumph for tho stubborn 
dofendors of tho Plaid was tho 
first since 1928 when Howard 
Ilarpstor routed the Fighting Irish 
In their own back yard to the tune 
of '27-7. This ono touchdown vic­
tory, howovor, looked far sweeter 
to l ho Tartan supporters than any 
7 touchdown massacre. As far 
as they were concerned, 7 to 0 
looked every bit. as good as 70 to 0.
Carnoglo Scores Early
In a word tho Irish wore boaton 
all tho way. From the moment 
Bunny Bur/.lo rocovorod a Nol.ro 
Dame fumble on tho opening Ulok- 
off, tho gamo was all Carnoglo 
Toeh. On tho third play of I ho 
gamo Bovovlno passed to LoWla 
for tho only score, and from then' 
on the gamo was a ding-dong bat­
tle featuring nothing else than 
sheer power. Tho Tartans got 
their tally and then defied their 
Illustrious rivals to take tholr load 
away from thorn.
At no time did tho Notre Damo 
attack function elToetlvoly. Tho 
great Carnoglo lino smeared their 
best backs bot'oro tholr Interfer­
ence could got under way, and 
whonovor the Irish did got In I Maid 
territory tho Scots’ dofonso tight­
ened with astounding swiftness. 
Only Don Elsor, 215-pound sopho- 
moro EilllbuoU from Gary, Indium», 
carried a really sorlous threat. 
Lightening fast for his groat hulk, 
tho Irish behemoth for a whllo 
looltod as If ho might bo able to 
beat down the Pittsburghers’ do* 
I'nuses, Inil. ho too faded out as tho

nity.
Only poor punting by tho Tar- 
tan hooters kept Notre Damo lu 
the running at all. Time and again 
mediocre kicks placed the Ilarpstor 
machine In the hole, but each time 
that great forward wall stiffened, 
forcing the Groori to take futllely

Council Approves 
Debating Union
At tho last meeting of Student 
Council, the Carnegie Dobatlng 
Union, an undergraduate society, 
was recognized as an active cam­
pus organization. At this same 
meeting, the Council approved tho 
executive committee of tho Bac­
chanalian Society, campus dra­
matic organization. This commit­
tee consists of Mary Rowlos, Au­
drey Kelly, and Regis Joyce.
Permission was granted by 
Council to the B'ackman Company, 
advertising agency, to use tho 
songs, "Fight for the Glory of Car­
negie” and the Alma Mater, in radio 
programs sponsored by the Hud­
son Motor Company.
Council also granted permission 
to Pi Delta Epsilon, men’s national 
journalistic honorary, to use This­
tle Hall for a tea dance on Wed­
nesday, • October 25, from- 4 to 6 
o’clock.
The proposed budget . of Scab­

Carnegie’s Underworld Is Explored 
By Tartan’s Snooping Reporters
By MARGARET GRIFFIN and 
VERONICA KLOOS
Carnegie has an underworld. Un 
suspecting students liavo for year.- 
gone their knowledge - seeking 
ways, never guessing that their 
scurrying feet tread upon echoing 
and re-echoing subterranean pas­
sages. Their leisure hours have 
seldom boon spoilt Investigating 
the Wheels that make the lllf'e 
world of Carnoglo go round and 
round
But tho wheels are thoro. As 
far ns the students know, ono cel­
lar I'urnaco heats the nine campus 
buildings. Wator comes from llttlo 
pipes bore and there. The cam­
pus’ Monday washing Is done In 
tho Homo “Ec” Department and 
strung along the Cut to dry. You 
haven’t noticed It? Then perhaps 
there Is more work to carrying on 
a college than you suspect.
Life in our underworld might 
never have been made public had 
not two of Tartan’s snooping re­
porters decided to bring all to 
light. Witness, then, their prowl­
ing tour through Carnegie tombs, 
guided by .that famous king of the 
lnderground world, Mr. Frank Or- 
bln.
Tho trail Is picked up In Admin­
istration Hall by the unlocking of 
a hoavy door. Scene Ono presents 
a confused picture of three people 
groping through Inky darkness In 
the first tunnel, which runs tho 
'onglh of the main corridor of tho 
College of industries. They thread 
tholr proearlotls way among greatt. 
expansion pipes. Suddenly tho daz> 
zllng Illumination from a ton can- 
dlo-power bulb reveals thoso pipes 
to be sovoral rod, white, under­
sized and oversized heating units,, 
which wander continuously to all 
the biddings. Again utter black­
ness.
Low bridge ahead! Apparently a 
few hundred water pipes, with fil­
tration and cooling channels, are 
playmates of the heating systems, 
and go scooting across the tunnel! 
at unexpected places. The report­
ers almost regret their snoopinessi

BUNNY B'URSSIO PLACED HIS NAME ALONG.SIDE OF CARNEGIE'S
IMMORTALS by MeMn groat play Saturday. I-Ie now rank« with riuch
croal. linemen a» Dreshur, Sample, and Hlglibergor, and bow the all-
American board can overlook him this year in boyond mo. Ho Memn
now played before the eye» of two of Aqioricu'» leading footbull
cpacheH, and before tho souson in over bo will have played before two
more of them.
Burzio proved eonelmrively that his ability 1« not all physical. In 
tlio cloning minutes of the game IiIh stulllng tactic« »lowly but surely 
Bank whatever hopes remalnod with tho Irish. He capitalized on the 
etupldlty of lbo Irish captain In tho closing minutes by deliberately 
stepping offside. This cost the Scotch five yards each time, but It 
gave tliem tho bull for another down when tho Ramblers Insisted on 
accepting the penalty.******
COACH HARPSTER CAN WELL BE PROUD OF HIS THREE GREAT 
ENDS. When Lib Lewis was injured in making the winning touch­
down, tho Tartan chief called upon George Goodrldgo to go in and 
qarry on. The marvelour. game Goodrldge played wa3 one of the high 
points of tho struggle. Pitted against the highly publicized and noto­
rious DCLLTES Krause, the Washington, Pa., product, gave the Green 
tackle more than ho had bargained for. The great work by the Car­
negie ends was one of the reasons that Notre Dame looked so bad on 
the outside plays.******
IT SEEMS TOO BAD THAT EVEN THE PITTSBURGH PAPERS re­
fuse to take the Tartan machine seriously. Every time Carnegie bumps 
off some highly touted team tho scribes Immediately put up the cry 
that tho opposition looked terrible, they were off their game, and In 
general It was all a fluke anyway. Some papers, especially those In 
Philadelphia, considered that the 25-0 drubbing tho Slclbos gave Tem­
ple was just so much boloney.
No team looks good when It Is getting tho tar kicked out of Jt. 
Perhaps Notre Dame Is not anywhoro near as good as they were Jn 
tho days of Rocltno, but anyone who saw the game Saturday knows 
that they have no mediocre club this year.******
THE PAPERS ALSO REFUSED TO GIVE DON ELSER, tho Irish's 
collosal fullback, his due. The 215-pound giant was the whole Notre 
Damo team while he was in there. He had more drive and speed 
than all the rest of the backflcld put together. He starts fast and 
hits hard, and he promises to develop Into a truly great back. Some 
of the Carnegie team claim that he Is tho greatest fullback they have 
ceen perform in a number of years.******
AGAIN CARNEGIE’S PROMISING ELEVEN SHOULD BE WARNED 
AGAINST becoming ovorconfldont. They are now working under tho 
distinct disadvantage of being tho favorite for a change, and conse­
quently ovory team they play from now on will bo pointing for them. 
Teams that look awfully good early In tho season are frequently tho 
ones that fold up tho worst lator on. Wash*Jett 1ms a very stroUg 
toam t his season, and If tho Tartans Insist on taking thorn lightly they 
nro liable to walco up with a sovoro headache noxt Sunday morning. 
Tho Xavier game should bo a good object lesson to tho Plaid war­
riors. Tho Pltt-W. & J. game was another caso In point; tho Pan- 
thors tioolc tho gamo far too lightly, and only good broaks gave thorn a 
ftknrd-oarnod victory.
In splto of tho good crowd that attondod tho Notre Damo gamo, tho 
A. A. in still In no position to purchase a now sot of helmets to lit 
Inflated hat-fllzoB.******
ATTENDING THE HOME-COMING GAME WERE MANY FORMER 
CARNEGIE luminaries. Among those showing up to watch and play 
for tholr alma mater were George Kavol, one of the greatest half­
back» In Carnegie history; Pal Miller, a truly great swimmer; Wayne 
High, former basketballer; Joe Bronson, former editor of this column; 
Murray Armentrout, another great halfbhck, and former captain, Emil 
Stankey, track star of tho past three years; and “Red" Jones, last i 
year’s varsity oenter.
Mr. Kovel, on being questioned by Mr. Leonard, let It be known 
that ho was very well satisfied with his new berth. He stated that he 
Jind a great bunoh of boys performing for him, eto.
“Have you won any games, George?" inquired Mr. Lenoard.
“Well," bluahod the former Tartan great;, “we’ve won one gamo 
outright and have won three moral victories."
At this point Mr. Kavol took rofugo in the field house. ******

CARNEGIE FAVORED 
TO STOP PRESIDENTS
lied and Black Arc Pointing 
for Plaid; Expect to 
Upset Scotchmen
With the record of having 
beaten Notre Dume to Its credit, 
the Plaid machine now has W. & 
J. to look forward to as its next 
opponent. Tho fact that the Irish 
are now out of the way should bo 
an Indication that tho Presidents 
should be a comparatively easy 
gamo, but such is not the case.
Comparing tho scores or tho 
Tech-Xavler and the W. & J.-Xavier 
games, the Tartans have proof that 
they will not have a pushover on 
their hands for next Saturday. 
The fact that the Presidents beat 
the Musketeers by five more points 
than Harpster’s boys shows that 
the Little Washington team will 
make the Plaid light to add another 
victory to its growing list.
Day Points for Plaid 
“Hank" Day, head coach of the 
Red and Black, will have Ills ma­
chine ready to go, full force, and 
that will be with plenty of speed 
and power. Howard I-Iarpster is 
not going to go into this game 
with his eyes closed, and conse­
quently will put his players 
through just as hard paces this 
week, In preparation for the 
Prexies, as he did for the Ander­
son-coached mob.

I
Coach William E. “Hooks” Sam­
ple’s freshman team got off to an 
impressive start last Friday after­
noon when they defeated the per­
ennially strong Kisld team at Salts- 
burg, 7-0. This is the first time a 
Carnegie freshman team has beat­
en tho prep schoolers since 1030, 
when the Plebes won 2 0.
It was a punting and plunging 
duel all the way with the year 
lings getting their winning ad­
vantage early. Two long runs by 
Lehman and a pass to Kopczak 
gave the Plebes a touchdown in 
tho first quarter, and from then 
on it Was a pretty even battle.
The fine showing being made by 
the Plebes lately is quite encourag­
ing to the coaching staff, for they 
realize that they have some valua­
ble material coming up to the var­
sity next year. At first it was feared 
that the frosh were a washout this 
year, for early in the season they 
proved totally unable to cope with 
the varsity, but lately they have 
been giving Coach Harpster’s men 
plenty to worry about.
Originally it was planned that the 
freshmen were not to p.ay any of­
ficial contests tills season, but it 
was found practical to find out just 
what they had to offer in real com­
petition. The Sample proteges 
are scheduled to take on the Cali­

Skibo Guard Was 
Formerly Fullback
Clyde Heinzer has been a stellar 
guard on- the Carnegie team ever 
since his sophomore year. 1-Ie 
started on the Butler Tllgh squad 
as a backlleld man and played in 
that pna'Mnn for four venrs. cap­
taining the team In his final season. 
At the same time he was chosen as 
the all Western Pennsylvania 
scholastic fullback, starring against 
the stronger high schools in tills 
district. 1-Ie started on the fresh­
man squad as a backfield man, but 
shifted in bis sophomore year to 
his present guard position.
He is a conscientious work­
er, and distinctly reliable seldom 
leaving the field for injuries. His 
optimism is best shown by a little 
incident that followed the game 
last Saturday. Clyde was being 
half carried up the Held house 
steps, badly bruised, with a black 
eye and several cuts. Up dashes a 
hearty well-wisher who slaps the 
Butler lad on the back, rattling bis 
molars, then breaks out with: 
“Nice game, son, bow’d ya feel?’’ 
Being a true gentleman, Heinzer 
smiles as sweetly as his shaken 
features would allow and answers 
coyly, “Never better, how are you?”

Over Past in Meet 
Against Irish
In the opener against Notre 
Dame last Saturday the Tartan 
harriers gave the Irish a lot more 
competition than they have shown 
for some years, the score being 
24-31 in favor of the visiting op­
ponents. For many years Notre 
Dame has had a very strong cross­
country team, and scores for meets 
which the Tartans have had with 
the Irish in past years have been 
quite decisive and one-sided. In 
last year’s meet the Notre Darners 
placed five men in the first six 
places, making a score of 18 to 
Carnegie’s 37.
McFarlane, of Notre Dame, 
crossed the finishing line in first 
position after running a four and 
one-quarter mile course through 
the park in 24:10. Not far behind 
McFarlane ran Giolma, Tech, to 
take second. Giolma was clo’se 
enough to make us believe that at 
another time perhaps the outcome 
of the race would be somewhat 
altered, although it was obvious 
that the Tartan runner was putting 
everything he had into Saturday’s 
meet. Young, of Notre Dame, 
showed a well executed expendi­
ture of conserved energy when he 
sprinted past Allen, of Tech, to 
take third place. Allen had passed 
the Notre Dame runner just over 
the crest of Flagstaff Hill towards 
the finishing line, but he was un­
able to maintain the lead and took 
fourth place. Duke and Roberts, 
of Notre Dame, finished fifth and 
sixth respectively, and Schell and 
Ramsey, of Tech, crossed seventh 
and eighth. Morgan, of Notre 
Dame, took ninth, and Burke, Tech, 
finishing tenth.
This coming week-end the Car­
negie cross-country team will visit 
Geneva to repeat the decisive vic­
tory the Tartans administered 
over the Beaver Falls running 
team last year, when they downed 
tho Geneva harriers 16-30, coming 
within one point of getting a per­
fect score.

YOU often hear the word balance —

What you read, "Chesterfield Cigarettes | F

welded together; that is, home-grown to- ^ 
baccos, the right kind, the right quantity—®

When these tobaccos, are balanced one

When they are in balance, then you have

A Balanced Blent

Future opponents of Carnegie’s 
grid machine ran true to expecta­
tions in some cases, and ran into 
upsets in others. The victory of 
W. &. J. over Xavier by the score 
of 8-0 only goes to show that the 
Tartans will have their hands full 
next Saturday, since W. & J.’s 
score was five points better than 
the score by which the Plaid eked 
out a narrow victory over Xavier 
a week ago.
Purdue came through with a 14-0 
win over Chicago at Lafayette, 
Ind., to keep them well up and in 
there in the Big Ten. Pitt ran 
onto a big surprise when they went 
to Minneapolis to meet Minnesota. 
Expecting something of a pushover, 
the Panthers were brought down 
to earth by the Gophers to the 
tune of 7-3.
Although Colgate took over N. 
Y. U., the score of 7-0 was much 
less than was expected by those 
who think they know. Colgate 
was by far the favorite to win, due 
to the fact that N. Y. U. had not 
shown much promise so far this 
year.
Michigan State, without an 
especially strong team, beat Mar­
quette by one touchdown, winning 
6-0. Western Maryland thrashed 
Georgetown, Saturday when they 
piled up 20 counters to George­
town’s nothing.
Other important scores of last 
week included Duquesne’s win over 
Detroit, 14-0. In the presence of 
03,000 fans, according to the news­
papers, Michigan beat Ohio State

"In painting this picture," lie 
said, “I did not try to express a 
local situation, but a generalized 
one, and while the landsoupe indi­
cates mills, they can bo most any­
where. 1 took an ago-old theme of 
Mother and Child and have tried 
to produce not a sentimental story, 
but one of color and form to which 
1 believe the art of pictures 
should confine itself. Above all, 1 
am too keenly conscious of the 
faults of the picture to discuss 
it, and I prefer that the student 
see it in the gallery and mako up 
his mind whether or hot he likes 
it, because after all, if a picture 
needs too much explanation, it be­
comes a diagram to conversation 
and not an artistic statement which 
is supposed to carry its own 
story.”

Tartan. Was it a knockout? 
Needless to ask; reports every­
where say it was so there you 
are. The editors could close up 
shop for the balance of the year' 
and still satisfy me, because they 
did a good job. I don’t know when 
I enjoyed reading the Tartan so 
much. A little bit of news on all 
the campus questions. Who said 
the Tartan wasn’t going right 
along. So let’s have more issues, 
six pages if you wish, like the 
last one. I don’t mind if I take a 
week oil to read - it, it’s worth 
while.

DIDJA NOTICE
Two of the worst enemi.es of the 
steel industry have at last been 
conquered. Since steel was first 
poured, the control of the oxygen 
and phosphorus contents of the fin­
ished products has been a major 
problem of the metallurgist. The 
steel companies have spent large 
sums of money in an effort to de­
vise a finishing treatment which 
would enable them to accurately 
control these elements. Dr. C. H. 
Herty, Jr., of the Metallurgical Ad­
visory Board of the Carnegie Insti­
tute became interested in this prob­
lem and devoted several years to 
research and experimentation, the 
results of which have proved em­
inently satisfactory.
Dr. Herty’s experiments led him 
to believe that the common prac­
tice of adding ferro-manganese in 
the furnace and silicon and alumi­
num in the ladle for deoxidizing 
purposes was at fault. He decid­
ed to try the oxides of these ele­
ments and found that the results 
obtained Avere superior to those ob­
tained with any other type of de­
oxidizer previously known. Dr. 
Herty as a result of these experi­
ments produced “silico-mangan- 
ese,” the most successful deoxi­
dizer yet discovered for open 
hearth steel. This one victory was 
not sufficient for Dr. Herty, how­
ever, for he next turned his atten­
tion to the phosphorus factor of 
the problem.
For years, it has been considered 
a fact that the character of the 
metal could be controlled by the 
type of flame used to melt the slag 
and metal in the furnace. Dr. I-Ier- 
ty started to devise a method of 
controlling the properties of this 
flame, but soon became convinced 
that the slag itself played a more 
important role than -the flame. 
With this thought in mind, Dr. 
Herty set about controlling the 
slag composition as the slag was 
charged into the fui’nace and dem­
onstrated that by this means the 
characteristics of the finished met­
al could be accui’ately predicted, 
j before the heat was charged.
These two discoveries made in 
collaboration with the scientists of 
che Bureau of Mines Experiment 
Station reveal only one phase of 
the host of services being rendered 
to, the industrial world by Carne­
gie. The close relations between 
the industries of this vicinity and 
Carnegie make this school an ideal 
vehicle for the dissemination of 
scientific knowledge.
Well, the home-coming is over 
and the home-coming became an
afterthought, because you know
all those who came had to go
home again. Anyway, I am sure 
that the grads, both old and new, 
recent If you wish, had a grand 
and glorious time during their 
week-end sojourn hereabouts. I 
wonder. If there were any long- 
distant visitors. It would be a bit 
interesting to find out who the 
longest traveler for the home-com- 
ing was. They had a real pro­
gram mapped out for them and 
their stay should prove of Interest, 
•especially so for the older ones, be­
cause. as I mentioned before, there 
are a great number of changes in 
and about the campus.
The ambitious student, look­
ing ahead to a successful ca­
reer in business or profes­
sion, will find that a connec­
tion with a reputable bank­
ing institution is a real step 
forward. Plan to make such 
a connection while you are 
in college — the Mellon Na­
tional Bank welcomes ac­
counts of any size and our 
officers are always ready to 
Interest themselves in your 
problems.

sound, at least the first part of 
the word does. What I am think­
ing of is that they have changed 
their tune and have put the ball

steeds. I was a bit encouraged 
when I returned to see that the old 
:gray horses had departed and in 
their place iron horses had been 
installed. I am not sure whether 
both the ends of the drive have 
been so treated, but at least one 
end has been "re-horsed” and we 
rare gradually approaching the 
semblance of a dignified barrier. I 
better hold up a bit, though, be­
cause it may be possible that some­
one might walk off with the ball

we do?

We are now entering upon an­
other week of school, two or three 
have passed by, and I am wonder­
ing how all the old men like the 
»routine after their vacation?. As 
regards the new men, I hardly 
know what to offer. I suppose 
they are all wondering what it is 
all about (class assignments). I 
can sympathize with them be­
cause only a couple of years ago 
I was in the same boat, floundering 
about hoping for some oasis to 
appear on the horizon.
I noticed that the night activi­
ties have gotten into the swim and 
by the time this is read some or 
the affairs will have taken place. 
Upon referring to the handbook, 
that little compendium, issued by 
the Night Student Council, lists 
three affairs for the two week­
-ends. Two just past and one for 
this Saturday; Arts and Engineer­
ing were the two which have al­
ready taken place and Industries 
is scheduled for this week-end. 
They always do have good times 
at the affairs and all I can say is 
that any student missing his col­
lege affair is overlooking a pleas­
ant time. I can’t tell the Arts and 
Engineering students to attend 
their affair, because they are over, 
but those Industries men who hap­
pen to read this jumble would 
send a pleasant evening if they 
attended the affair on this Satur­
day which is scheduled for them, 
in the Gymnasium I believe.

I am in sympathy with the desire of the student body to 
show its appreciation oJ: the marvelous playing of the football 
team last Saturday and its appreciation of its coach, Mr. Harp- 
ster. No one who was present enjoyed the game more than I. 
The officers and faculty arc all proud of the fine sportsmanship, 
the intelligence and the resourcefulness which the team 
displayed.
The President of the Student Council presented a petition 
to the Executive Board on Sunday requesting that Monday be 
declared a holiday. We did not feel that we could accede to 
this request. The students can not afford the time. Many of 
them are in debt. Their parents are making great sacrifices to 
send them to college and are expecting that their work will be 
interrupted as little as possible. The courses in a technical 
school are difficult and wc arc concerned because a good many 
students are dropped every year for failure to meet the re- 
qtiirod scholarship standards.
The Executive Board hoped that some other means might 
be found of showing appreciation of the football team besides 
giving up classes.
The Student Council made a strong plea for the holiday 
and wo have always tried to accede to the requests of the Stu­
dent Council but T do not believe, in declaring a holiday, we 
would have had the support of the majority of the parents who 
arc sending their sons and daughters to this institution.
THOMAS S. BAKER, 
President, Carnegie Institute of 
Technology.
An International Mention
Mr. Alexander Kostcllow in winning honorable mention for 
his painting, “After Dinner,” entered in the thirty-first Inter­
national Exhibition of Modern Painting at Carnegie Institute, 
has done much to advance tho reputation of Carnegie’s College 
of Fine Arts. Falling in line with Carnegie’s steady upward 
climb among educational institutions, this incident is significant 
of the fine reputation Carnegio’s faculty and alumni are build­
ing for thoir Alma Mator.
In architectural competition our school asks no quarter; 
in drama wo need merely point to tho success of our graduates 
and to the opinion of the critics who view tho Little Theater 
productions; and equally important standings are being estab­
lished by other departments in our school.
Every effort and success such as Mr. Kostellow’s should 
be recognized and complimented by the students as woll as the 
faculty.

as they stumble down a lone tooth­
pick ladder, guided by a faint ray 
of light in the distance. Here the 
trio finds a class in Building Con­
struction. Slight pause ensues 
while explanations are made to the 
instructor that the suspicious-look- 
ing young ladies are merely «think­
ing of buying Carnegie.
From the back of Machinery 
Hall the path leads through the in­
tensely hot boiler and furnace 
rooms, the heart of the boating 
plant. Then up a long spiral stair­
way, at the top of which two dizzy 
reporters stand, gasping after 
their winding ascent. In the next 
dark tunnel are many overhead 
cables, running lengthwise for 
several hundred feet. This tunnel 
terminates beneath Engineering 
Hall in a pair of stone steps lead­
ing to a cool, rock-lined storeroom, 
a typical catacomb, hollowed from 
tho earth.
Back to the inferno. A tunnel, 
in which tho heat seems to pass 
tho one hundred and fifty degree 
mark, continues 011 its narrow way 
Into the lower rogions or the Col­
lege of Fine Arts, interrupted only 
twice by overhead grates from 
which passorsby in tho quadrangle 
often feel unwelcome draughts of 
hot air. Skirting tho Arts School 
tho explorers stumble onward, 
pausing for a moment at the fork 
In tho tunnel which marks the 
Junction of tho tunnels from tho 
gymnasium and Margaret Morri- 
son. It is di in cult to realize that 
just above thoir heads, four- 
whooled "dovll-machlnos” scroam 
by on two wheels all during the 
day.
A jog to tho right, and tho 
weary tourists tiro 011 tho last lap 
of their journey. A glimpso is had 
of tho busy laundry. Thon terri­
tory, familiar as tho scone of a dis- 
»..».1 Pwnn Initiation, looms to tho
left and right as the subterranean 
haunts of the gym are reached. A 
sharp turn to the right—through 
an auspicious-loolting door—up a 
short flight of stairs—and the three 
catacombers burst in upon a con­
ference between Don Lovewell and 
1 Max I-Iannum.
The end of the trail has been 
been reached at last, but one treas­
ure has not yet been disclosed to 
his chattering companions by Mr. 
Orbin. On the basement of the 
Arts School a heavy iron gate is 
unlocked, a fireproof door is open­
ed, and the three enter the sacred 
and well-protected portals of the 
room in which the records of Car­
negie students of all time, past and 
present, are kept. An Arts student 
from ’0G; a Maggie Murpli who 
left in ’15; records of the grades 
of the graduates of 1932. But the 
most important feature of the 
room to two dusty, hot feature 
writers is that the room is cool!

the founder and first editor of the 
Tartan and the Thistle. He recalls 
that the Tartan was started in tho 
fall of 190G as a private venture. 
A charge of five cents was made 
for the first issues, and they were 
stacked In the halls with the no­
tice that each student should take 
one and deposit five cents in a box. 
This system was soon abandoned 
because some students not only 
forgot to pay but accidently re­
moved other peoples money from 
tho box.
Also returning to Carnegie last 
wock-ond was John S. Charles, first 
sports editor of the Tartan and 
captain of the first track team and 
of tho first hoclcoy team—Lho loam

scoreless during tho rogulation 
gamo but was beaten out in tho 
overtime period.___________
THE BIG WEEK-END
Our alumni who visited us during Homecoming, 
carried away with them the very definite impres­
sion that Carnegie’s greatest tradition—school 
spirit—was never better . . . every student was 
in every play up there in-the Stadium . . . 
That’s why Carnegie deserved to win . . . and no 
Tartan team ever fought harder . . . which is 
the biggest tribute one can offer.
We’ve waited five long years for that game 
. . . but it sure was worth waiting for . . . 
The Bun may not make All American . . . but 
as a matter of idle curiosity, we’d like to see the 
guard player who beats him out . . . however, 
it’s not fair to single out any one player . . . 
Harp said it was a team victory ... it was . . . 
but .iust the same, Joe Cronin isn’t the only boy 
wonder who can turn out championship teams 
... it was a great day for the Scotch . . . 
Burzio, Bevevino and Lewis . . . Viva Scot- 
landa.
Since we’re all overstocked with superlatives 
. . . how about our Kiltie Band? . . . maybe 
we’re prejudiced . . . but we don’t see how tfiey 
could be beaten for originality, color and genuine 
entertainment ... on the other hand no one 
seems to think a whole lot of the subtle way that 
they announce a Pep Rally around this yere 
school . . . the response to last Friday’s secret 
meeting was a wonderful comp’iment to the stu­

one a little ahead of time just for luck.
Armistice Day comes on a Saturday this year 
... so we all felt that if we did beat Notre 
Dame, the administration would give us that hol­
iday which we would otherwise miss ... up to 
the present time (late Sunday night) we’re not 
planning to sleep in tomorrow . . . they said no. *****
YE CHARITY BALL
It was unfortunate that the Charity Ball was 
held last Friday night. Homecoming eve is al­
ways a dead date but of course the committee 
had no way of knowing that when the calendar 
was drawn up last fall. Even so, a goodly crowd 
turned out and bore up well under the high col­
lar and stiff shirt.
The music was by far the best that has been 
heard in the Hall this season. Charley McCor­
mick, originally scheduled for the ball, got into 
some difficulties with the musicians’ union and 
was forced to retire in favor of the Paridise Har­
bour unit. It will take McCormick about 20 
dances to collect enough of the coin of the realm 
to pay off his fine.
Among the notables were Sam Wicks and Mary 
Jane Addy. Stew Murray and Harriet Butler, and
Jimmy Hughes with Ev Leighou. Bob Fish re­
turned to the old tramping ground with Marie 
Interthal. Bill Smith (with Mary Jane Grey), 
Norm Franke, Emil Stankey and Harry Madsen 
were other Homecomers who dropped in on the 
festivities. The list of shining faces a’so in­
cludes Gischel, Alice Philpott, Helen Deike and 
Ann Ferguson.*****
ALUMNI NEWS
The celebration dinner dance at the Hotel 
Schenley was what might mildly be called a howl­
ing success. Congratulations are in order for 
John Rieger and Doc Daugherty on their very 
fine party which topped an eventful week-end. 
There were 247 guests and no speakers at the 
banquet. We only wish that we had the space 
to list all of the alumni who were back. Those 
whose names do come to mind might be of inter­
est to classmates in distant localities who were 
unable to attend.
Fred Foster, captain of Carnegie’s first foot­
ball team and founder of many of our traditions, 
came all the way from Los Angeles to see the 
old crowd. Of course Butdy and Harpy were 
there. The class of ’08 were justly proud oC 
Ross Hammond and Sidney Siesel who were re­
cently appointed on the NRA committee to help 
the President in formulating a building construc­
tion code.
Tracy Tingley and Walt Flanagan postponed 
their executive duties at the Clairton Steel works 
over the week-end. Luge Spraglie was equally 
negligent about his position at J. & L. John S. 
Charles, ’08, ’09, ’10, kept his record for consecu­
tive Homecomings intact. P. B. Martin cruised 
down from Williamsport and Dwight Waite quit 
the A. T. & T. for the day.
“Shorty” Hollingsworth, Carnegie’s biggest 
graduate (6 feet G, etc.), and Bill Sivitz were 
present. Gus Kahn, steel magnate, and Bob 
Klein of ’09 football fame also came down. Dean 
Connelley forsook his councilmanic duties to be 
with the old grads. The Carnegie Athletic Board 
was represented by President John Labo'on, Lefty- 
Lee and Dennis Casey.
The old athletes were cheered by the presence 
of Mrs. Joseph Thompson, wife of the late Col. 
Joe, who was the first Director of Athletics way 
back when. Jimmy Robertson, who scored the 
touchdown, and Cy Comfort, who kicked the ex­
tra point when we beat Pitt for the first time 
back in ’23,; naturally were at the gathering. 
Howdy Dykeman, holder of many Skibo track rec­
ords, was seen talking to fellow trackers of 
yore such as Jack Bright, Clarence Peck, Walt 
Bates and George Dyke. ^

CURRENT OPINION
WHY FRATERNITIES?
To oatlufy tho Krogarlouu In- 
stlnct In man, fratornltloi) woro 
rounded at (lotlyaburg College. 
This, tho Initial reason, lutu devel­
oped, and, today Includes many 
minor purpose« which aro of vital 
Importance not only to thin Insti­
tution hut also to ovory individual 
within it.
Prominent among those many 
roasons for fraternities is tho bone- 
fit of homo life. Most Froslnnen, 
upon coming to school, find avail­
able some time during which they 
have nothing to do, and nowhero to 
go. For these fellows the frater­
nity is supposed to create a proper 
atmosphere in which surplus time 
can be advantageously employed. 
Good books, magazines, and music 
should be found in every fraternal 
reading room.
It is further important in help­
ing the Freshmen to overcome any 
obstacles which might be presented 
to him. In most fraternities the 
"Senior Sponsor’’ plan is used. In 
this tne Freshmen or both groups1 
of underclassmen are placed under 
the guidance of upperclassmen in 
their particular fields. To these 
men the Freshman comes with his 
problems, whether they refer to 
studies, social relations, or finances.
Another important phase of life 
for which tho fraternity providos 
is man's association with his fel­
low beings. Social fenctions at 
Gettysburg Coilogo aro usually 
sponsored by these groups of men. 
Freshmen who associate them­
selves find it very difficult to be 
selves with rraternltlos find It very 
difficult to become secludod from 
tho rest of tho coilogo campus. 
Recent articles written in popular 
magazines have stressed the po'nt 
that mothers and fathers should 
not worry about sons who spond 
much hf their time with female 
companions, but rather that they 
should worry about their sons who 
Tall to enter into college social 
functions, and about those espe­
cially who seclude thomselvos 
from both boys and girls. Tho 
fraternity guards against any such 
occurrence, and builds up this par­
ticular phase, of a fellow's lifo.
Many other reasons can bo 
given, but the Important thing to 
remember is that a fraternity Is 
good for more than one or two 
reasops; there are many angles 
and sides to its construction. To 
all Freshmen who have joined a 
group, and to all upperclassmen 
who have to become so educated: 
don’t omit any of these important 
fraternal purposes which have 
been mentioned. Enter into all of 
them, and build up not only from 
one angle but from all angles.

Dear Sirs:
We regret very much that

Wo understand that several 
automobiles full of students 
from Carnegie drove through 
the Pittsburgh campus and 
caused a disturbance for sever­
al minutes. We had posted 
notice of our agreement and 
had taken precaution to keep 
our organized parade from the 
Pittsburgh campus.
Any damages incurred will be 
settled by Student Council and 
wo apologize for any disorder.
Yours truly,

It means that it’s made right . . .

how to make Granger, knew how. It 
means that it’s cut right.
Just pack Granger good and

THIRTY-FIVE CENTS* 
Ism9t Miacli/
Most college allowances go only so far. But 
even at that you can probably spare 35 cents, 
once a week.
It isn’t much—35 cents—hardly the price 
of a movie or hair cut. Yet for 35 cents, if 
you know the ropes, you can telephone as far 
as 100 miles.
That probably means you can telephone 
home! Can 35 cents buy more pleasure than 
that? You can pick up a budget of family 
news . , . talk over your problems . . . share 
your interests. There’s nothing like a “voice 
visit” with the folks back home to brighten, 
your whole week—and theirs.

That means, ask the Operator for your

If you’ve fixed a date in advance, the family
