CMU clari?es thereal meaning of “free” bus rides
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
Earlier in the semester, 
the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity was noti?ed that 
there would be a 3.2 percent 
tuition increase for students, 
which would take effect for 
the 2016-2017 academic 
year. Upon further inspec-
tion, many noticed that the 
separate fees that contribute 
to the total cost of tuition var-
ied in how much their prices 
increased. The most notable 
disparity was the drastic in-
crease in the transportation 
fee, which will spike from 
its current standing at $150 
to $180, totaling to a 20 
percent jump. In response 
to concerns and questions 
posed by the Carnegie Mel-
lon community, The Tartan 
sat down with Gregory Billy, 
director of campus services 
and director of risk services, 
and Michelle Porter, director 
of parking and transportation 
services, to understand the 
cause of the transportation 
fee increase.
In order to understand 
the factors that resulted in 
the 2016-2017 transportation 
fee increase, it is important 
to understand exactly what 
this fee covers. Billy broke 
down the factors contribut-
ing to this fee by noting that 
2.4 percent of the fee is di-
rected towards all the campus 
shuttles, with the exceptions 
of Bakery Square, while an-
other 0.6 percent is directed 
towards the administrative 
cost of managing transpor-
tation. Unsurprisingly, the 
remaining 97 percent of this 
money is directed towards 
the Port Authority of Allegh-
eny County bus services that 
carry students all around the 
Pittsburgh area.
What many current stu-
dents aren’t aware of is the 
relative newness of the card 
tapping system that is used in 
Port Authority transit today. 
From 2002-2012, Carnegie 
Mellon University was en-
gaged in a contract with Port 
Authority which allowed stu-
dents to engage in this mode 
of transportation for a ?at 
rate which was paid by the 
university. “The university 
paid a ?at rate, students got 
on the bus, and the bus driver 
had a little clicker that count-
ed how many students from 
Carnegie Mellon rode the 
bus,” Billy said. As the Port 
Authority prices increased, 
so did the ?at rate paid by the 
university.
In 2012, however, Carne-
gie Mellon University entered 
into a new contract with the 
Port Authority of Allegheny 
County, with the awareness 
that there would be two ma-
jor changes. “At that time, it 
was known that Port Author-
ity would increase rates and 
also switch to this new tech-
nology,” Billy said. This “new 
technology” referred to the 
card tapping system that al-
lows students to tap their ID 
card to ride the bus, a major 
change from the clickers that 
were previously used by the 
bus drivers. The ef?ciency of 
this new technology led to 
more precision when taking 
into account just how many 
Carnegie Mellon students 
were taking advantage of the 
bus services. As it turned out, 
the previous method used by 
Port Authority bus drivers 
actually under-counted the 
number of Carnegie Mellon 
students that rode the bus 
Jelani Cobb compares race relations of the past to those faced in society today  
JAMES WHEATON
Junior Staffwriter
This Thursday, Feb. 11, 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity hosted author, historian, 
and educator William Jelani 
Cobb as the featured speaker 
for its Martin Luther King 
Day Celebration. Cobb, an 
award - winning writer and 
Fulbright fellow, delivered his 
lecture entitled “The Half Life 
of Freedom: Race and Justice 
in America Today” as part of 
a series of lectures addressing 
the issue of race in America.
Cobb grew up in Queens, 
but both his parents have a 
southern background. After 
attending Howard University 
for his undergraduate degree, 
Cobb is now a writer for The 
New Yorker and an associate 
professor of history and direc-
tor of the Institute for African 
American Studies at the Uni-
versity of Connecticut. “These 
are interesting times we live 
in,” Cobb said. “Because I’m 
a historian, I recognize the 
grasp that the past has on 
the present.” Throughout 
his speech, Cobb connected 
events in the past to events in 
the present, and used his ex-
pertise as a historian to com-
pare past themes and current 
headlines. His lecture touched 
upon events ranging from the 
Missouri Compromise to more 
recent con?icts, such as those 
in Ferguson, Missouri.
While the physical insights 
of Isaac Newton and Albert 
Einstein may not seem related 
to the struggles of African-
Americans, Cobb showed how 
they mimic the way human 
rights has evolved in the U.S. 
Newton created the theory of 
gravity, and used that to pre-
dict the motion of celestial 
bodies. However, Cobb notes 
that his predictions were 
never quite right, always just 
slightly off the center of what 
was factually recorded. Then 
came Einstein, whose theories 
gave us the ?nal information 
we needed to fully understand 
how bodies of mass react with 
one another. Cobb states that 
these discoveries follow the 
same path as the foundation 
of civil liberties in that there 
is a slight difference between 
the theory and reality. “If we 
look at these principles as 
they are enshrined within the 
Constitution, we can predict 
how the society will look,” 
Cobb said. “Yet our society is 
not quite where we want it 
Chinese Lunar New Year ushers in the Year of the Monkey
DEBORAH CHU
Asst. News Editor
Last week, various events 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity and around the Pittsburgh 
area were held to honor the 
Chinese Lunar New Year, 
which fell on Monday, Feb. 8 
this year. Major celebrations 
at Carnegie Mellon included 
a Chinese New Year Extrava-
ganza, which was featured on 
Friday, Feb. 5, for Carnegie 
Mellon’s weekly Late Night 
series, and Lunar Gala, an an-
nual student-led fashion show 
that consistently boasts one of 
the largest attendance rates 
for a university event, which 
took place Saturday, Feb. 13. 
Additionally, in Pittsburgh, 
Squirrel Hill and the Chinese 
community of the city of Pitts-
burgh teamed up to host a two 
week celebration, which fea-
tured a Lunar New Year Kick-
Off Festival on Feb. 6, as well 
as an upcoming Year of the 
Monkey Lunar New Year Pa-
rade on Feb. 21, both of which 
are open to the public.
On Friday, Feb. 5, over 
400 people gathered on the 
?rst ?oor of the University 
Center to attend the festivi-
ties at the Chinese New Year 
Extravaganza. The event was 
co-hosted by the Chinese Stu-
dents Association and Late 
Night at CMU, but included 
participation from numerous 
other campus organizations. 
Various Asian organizations 
— including AKDPhi, JSA, 
TSA, HKSA, and SIAM — sold 
food from their respective cui-
sines, in addition to providing 
free dim sum, a type of Asian 
cuisine. Dance performances 
were provided by the Carn-
egie Mellon group Sahara, 
a Bollywood fusion dance 
group, and Carnegie Mellon’s 
K-Pop Dance Club, as well as 
the University of Pittsburgh’s 
FRESA. Additionally, there 
were musical instrument per-
formances and a magic show. 
The extravaganza also fea-
tured various cultural games 
and activities, which included 
writing calligraphy, playing 
Ping Pong, and a pre-extrav-
aganza dumpling-making 
event.
Cultural elements were 
weaved throughout the fes-
tivities by the presence of 
lanterns, the use of the Chi-
nese character “Fu,” meaning 
happiness, and other tradi-
tional Chinese decorations, 
many of which were brought 
back from China by students 
over winter break. In terms of 
Lunar New Year celebrations, 
the annual extravaganza is 
the major cultural event open 
to the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity. Although the Lunar 
Gala fashion show, covered in 
this week’s Pillbox section, is a 
prominent campus event that 
also honors the Chinese New 
Year, the actual show is not 
Chinese New Year themed in 
any way and is instead a fash-
ion show that relies on the cre-
ativity of students interested 
in fashion, design and dance.
“I de?nitely believe that 
Chinese New Year Extrava-
ganza is the most important 
event during the year in terms 
of really bringing together 
the Asian and the non-Asian 
cultures,” said Ximin “Teddy” 
Ding, a sophomore math ma-
jor and member of CSA. “Stu-
dents from all races, coun-
tries and backgrounds were 
writing calligraphy, practic-
ing chopstick and Ping Pong 
skills, and having a fun time 
together,” Ding said. “Scenes 
like this are de?nitely a big 
part of our motivation to keep 
doing the New Year Extrava-
ganza every year.”
Apart from the festivi-
ties held at Carnegie Mellon, 
Pittsburgh residents trav-
eled to Squirrel Hill where 
they enjoyed an afternoon 
of live dance and music per-
formances at the Lunar New 
Year Kick-Off Festival, which 
featured the Pittsburgh Steel 
Dragon acrobatic lion dance 
team, the Pittsburgh Taiko 
Drummers, the Organization 
of Chinese Americans Cultur-
al Youth Dance Ensemble and 
Tzu Chi Academy, Pittsburgh 
Chinese School, Silk Elephant 
Thai dancers, Oom Yung Doe 
Martial Arts, U.S.A. Pro Ka-
rate, and the Yanlai Dance 
Academy, as well as perfor-
mances on the guzheng and 
hulusi, two types of Chinese 
instruments. The festival also 
featured arts and crafts such 
as origami, Chinese astrology 
coloring, dumpling making, 
paper lanterns, calligraphy, 
and painting.
The upcoming Year of the 
Monkey Lunar New Year Pa-
rade will take place on Murray 
Avenue from 11 a.m. to noon 
on Feb. 21, and will feature 
costumes, music, a marching 
band, and traditional Chinese 
and Thai dragons. From Feb. 6 
to Feb. 21, participating Squir-
rel Hill restaurants and cafés 
will also offer a 10 percent 
discount via the “Passport to 
Asian Eats” program, as part 
of the celebration.

On April 15, Kevin 
Zollman, an associate pro-
fessor of philosophy at Carn-
egie Mellon, along with co-
author Paul Raeburn, author 
of Psychology Today’s blog 
“About Fathers,” will release 
their novel The Game Theo-
rist’s Guide to Parenting: How 
the Science of Strategic Think-
ing Can Help You Deal with 
the Toughest Negotiators You 
Know — Your Kids.
Zollman’s ?rst presenta-
tion of game theory was in an 
advice column he wrote for 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
in 2013. In response to this, 
Jennifer Breheny Wallace, a 
former journalist currently 
working as a freelance writer 
and television commenta-
tor, used Zollman’s article to 
examine the struggles that 
parents and their children 
face. This ignited an interest 
in the idea of game theory in 
parenting, and soon enough 
Zollman was approached 
with the opportunity to cre-
ate a book based on this idea.
Part of the knowledge 
that goes in to writing a book 
such as this one involves 
some history with parenting, 
something that the childless 
Zollman did not have. Rae-
burn, who has written many 
times on the combination 
of science and parenting, 
and who is the father of ?ve 
children, entered the project 
by helping Zollman devise 
realistic scenarios of how 
game theory and parenting 
intersect.
When discussing the im-
pact of the ideas in the book, 
Zollman said, “Game theory 
is exciting because it applies 
to almost all of our social 
lives...It’s only natural that 
game theory should work for 
one of the toughest aspects 
of our lives — dealing with 
children.”
Game theorist publishes parenting advice
Patrick Wilson makes his directorial debut
Patrick Wilson, a 1995 
graduate of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s School of Drama and 
proli?c actor of the stage and 
screen, has returned to his 
alma mater to direct The Full 
Monty. He will be making his 
directorial debut as a direc-
tor-in-residence in the John 
Wells Directing Program.
The Broadway production 
of The Full Monty, adapted 
from the 1997 movie of the 
same name, made its debut 
in 2000 and was directed by 
Terrence McNally with music 
and lyrics by David Yazbek. 
Wilson earned a Tony Award 
nomination for best leading 
actor for his performance 
as Jerry. It’s safe to say that 
Wilson is very quali?ed to 
take on Carnegie Mellon’s 
production of the musical, 
which will run Feb. 18-27 in 
the Philip Chosky Theatre in 
the Purnell Center for the 
Arts.
“I’ve been talking with 
[professors] Gary Kline and 
Don Wadsworth about ?nd-
ing or making time to di-
rect for years,” Wilson said. 
“Gary suggested this was the 
perfect ?t because I know 
the show and we had the 
right class for it.”
Some of Wilson’s other 
acting credits include the 
characters of Raoul in The 
Phantom of the Opera movie, 
Josh Feldman in the movie 
Insidious, and, more recent-
ly, Lou Solverson on the sec-
ond season of FX’s television 
series Fargo, for which he 
was nominated for a Golden 
Globe Award.

Students “Give from the Heart” at university blood drive
RAHEELA AHSAN
Staffwriter
Blood drives on college 
campuses have soared in pop-
ularity in recent years. Over 
the past few years, posters 
are often seen around campus 
that advertise blood donations 
and there have been multiple 
occasions where students 
could walk by Rangos Hall in 
the University Center and see 
donors reclining on gurneys. 
In fact, Carnegie Mellon is one 
of the leading universities in 
blood donations, a fact that is 
especially relevant in a city as 
medically advanced as Pitts-
burgh. This past Thursday, 
Feb.  was the University’s most 
recent blood drive, which was 
held in the Connan Room in 
the Cohon Center from 8 a.m. 
to 1 p.m.
Debra James Bailey, a 
scheduling services special-
ist in the university registrar’s 
of?ce and Carnegie Mellon’s 
blood drive coordinator, has 
been involved with the Central 
Blood Bank (CBB) since 1988. 
As a survivor and recipient of 
blood transfusions, Bailey has 
since coordinated the campus 
blood drives as a means of 
giving back. She believes that 
though Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents are highly involved, they 
stand to gain a lot by donating 
blood. “By taking an hour of 
their busy schedules and fo-
cusing on another individual’s 
needs, [the act of donating] 
should have [students] totally 
experiencing a high like no 
other,” Bailey said.
While many people may re-
gard giving blood as a tedious 
charity, it only takes one hour 
and is a fairly simple process. 
In order to give blood, blood 
drive coordinators advise do-
nors to eat before and after do-
nating blood and to be in good 
health, all of which lends do-
nors to being in the best state 
possible so they can lie down 
and allow a nurse to pump a 
healthy amount of blood from 
their body.
While the process is far 
from fun, the importance of 
giving blood is unparalleled 
when considering the impact 
just one donation makes. For 
every bag of blood donated, 
three hospital patients are 
helped. “A person can have 
a dramatic impact on oth-
ers who they most likely will 
never have the opportunity 
to meet,” Bailey said. The city 
of Pittsburgh, recognized in-
ternationally for its advanced 
medical facilities, has a high 
demand for such donations, 
given that patients from across 
the country come to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center for its advanced health 
care and facilities that other 
hospitals often do not provide.
The CBB is one of four 
centers overseen by the Insti-
tute of Transfusion Medicine 
throughout the country. Lo-
cally, CBB is the sole provider 
for over 40 medical facilities in 
the region. They are also in a 
partnership with the National 
Bone Marrow Registry to as-
sist in research and provide 
components for patients that 
may need transplants. For 
instance, the “Be the Match” 
registry is a program that 
matches donors with patients. 
Additionally, CBB is a member 
of the Western Pennsylvania 
Hemophilia Center to provide 
care for those with bleeding 
disorders. CBB is a vital con-
tributor to the medical profes-
sion, and is thus appropriately 
reliant on Carnegie Mellon’s 
donations.
Both Bailey and John R. 
Papinchak, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s university registrar, have 
been engaged in this program 
for nearly thirty years. While 
Bailey can no longer donate 
blood due to an autoimmune 
disorder, her efforts with Pap-
inchak have not gone unno-
ticed. The University is widely 
recognized and lauded for its 
ability to give back to the com-
munity, and Carnegie Mellon 
University received an award 
for “The Top Twenty Corpo-
rate Donor Program with The 
Central Blood Bank” in 2015, 
along with an additional ?f-
teen awards.
Blood drives take place at 
Carnegie Mellon University 
every semester. Information is 
posted around campus prior to 
the event. For more informa-
tion about upcoming blood 
drives at Carnegie Mellon and 
how to get involved, students

to be. There is a nagging dis-
crepancy in America today 
that does not follow accord-
ing to our founding fathers’ 
beliefs, and that is the history 
of African-Americans in this 
country.”
According to Cobb, the 
present mimics history in 
what he calls “mini EKG’s,” 
with “racial ?ash points” that 
spark up. Ferguson is one of 
these ?ash points. So was the 
Missouri Compromise. These 
events are not new, nor have 
they ceased occurring. In 
fact, upon taking trips to Bal-
timore, Washington D.C., and 
St. Louis, Cobb noted that 
“[his] syllabus had jumped 
right off the page.”
Later on in the lecture, 
Cobb talked about the denial 
of segregation in America. He 
accused the U.S. of being a 
“nation of innocents,” unwill-
ing to talk about the proli?c 
and prominent racial issues 
of today. Cobb shared an an-
ecdote of an area where the 
hypocrisy of the people be-
comes clear.
“When we take about slav-
ery, we get the reaction of 
saying, ‘Well that was a long 
time ago, that had nothing to 
do with me, that was decades 
ago,’ but you know what’s in-
teresting is that people never 
say that about the Revolu-
tionary War.”
Perhaps the lack of culpa-
bility for things done in the 
past is preventing the nation 
from moving forward. Cobb 
is optimistic about the future 
of this country, as he believes 
“history favors those on the 
side of right.”
Overall, Cobb stressed 
the fact that ignorance of the 
past would leave the country 
ignorant of the future, and 
prevent any possible change 
that is needed in the pres-
ent. He ended with powerful 
messages from Martin Luther 
King Jr., who was the reason 
for Cobb’s presence on Carne-
gie Mellon’s campus. He men-
tions that King’s message was 
one of progress, the mantra 
of the civil rights movement 
“we shall overcome” meaning 
that the people would keep 
moving forward, would keep 
addressing these issues until 
there was an objective, just

and exactly how much the 
average student would use 
the bus services per year. Ac-
cording to Billy, information 
gathered from this new sys-
tem concluded that “the aver-
age student rides the bus 135 
times a year,” which showed 
“40 percent more ridership 
than had been projected” 
when compared to the old 
system.
The precision of the new 
card-tapping technology 
also led to more precision in 
the amount of money that 
Carnegie Mellon would pay 
to allow students to use the 
Port Authority bus services. 
Instead of paying a ?at rate 
to Port Authority, which had 
been implemented in the old 
contract, the 2012 agreement 
between the university and 
Port Authority stated that the 
university would pay half of 
the normal bus fare for stu-
dents. The regular bus fare 
for Port Authority is $2.50, 
but with the aid of the univer-
sity, students would only have 
to pay $1.25 per ride. Taking 
into account that the average 
student rides the bus about 
135 times a year, this number 
times $1.25 resulted in the 
?nal transportation fee price 
of $180 that was announced 
earlier in the semester. It 
should be noted that the price 
of $180 should be compared 
to the $338 that students 
would have to pay without 
aid from the university.
So what can students take 
away from this information? 
It is important for students 
to be aware that taking ad-
vantage of the Port Author-
ity bus services is not free, 
as we usually like to think of 
it. Despite the ease of access 
that comes with simply tap-
ping your card to ride the bus, 
there is actually a fee associ-
ated with the number of rides 
students take, and this price 
does eventually make its way 
back to students through the 
university’s transportation fee 
based on the data collected 
from the previous year.
As a potential solution 
to this issue, Billy suggested 
that students only use the 
bus when necessary, if they’re 
concerned about the jump in 
price. “If you’re just taking a 
short ride, like down Beeler 
Street, and it’s safe to walk 
and a nice day, you’re helping 
everyone to walk a block or 
two,” Billy said. As another ex-
ample, Michelle Porter noted 
that the distance from Ham-
burg Hall to Morewood Ave-
nue is a short enough distance 
for students to choose walk-
ing over the bus. This advice, 
however, should be taken 
with students’ safety in mind. 
“Sometimes it’s a safety issue. 
If it’s 2 o’clock In the morning 
and you’re walking up Beeler, 
for example, take the bus if it 
seems like the thing to do,” 
Billy said.
For those that were 
shocked by the drastic in-
crease in the transportation 
fee for the upcoming academ-
ic year, maybe this newly ac-
quired information will allow 
students to be more re?ective 
in just how much their actions 
make their way back to their 
tuition costs.

On the Issues: immigration differentiates 2016 hopefuls
During this presidential 
election, one of the key dif-
ferences between the candi-
dates — within and between 
parties — has been the ways 
in which each wants to reform 
immigration. While many of 
the proposals are similar, the 
details of immigration poli-
cies can be the difference be-
tween families being ripped 
apart, jobs for millions of citi-
zens, and even life or death. 
Long story short, this is an 
extremely important issue to 
keep track of throughout this 
election. To that end, here 
are some brief summaries on 
each candidate’s immigration 
policy:
Former Florida governor 
Jeb Bush
Bush believes in further se-
curing the southern border;.
However, he believes fencing 
is useless and creates a barrier 
to legal commerce. Instead, 
he wants to expand border 
patrol’s powers, particularly 
their access to waterways 
along the border, and imple-
ment an e-verify system that 
would force employers to im-
mediately check the work eli-
gibility of their workers upon 
hiring or expanding H1-B 
visas for highly skilled work-
ers. Bush also believes people 
in the country illegally ought 
to be able to work towards le-
gal status but not necessarily 
citizenship.
Retired Neurosurgeon 
Ben Carson
Carson feels that through 
a double fence, prosecution 
of all ?rst time offenders, and 
certain technologies, the bor-
der could be secured within 
one year. He also wants to tie 
all bene?ts of United States 
residency to legal citizen-
ship. People without criminal 
records would be allowed to 
remain as guest workers but 
forced to pay a tax penalty.
Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX)
Cruz vows to build a wall 
along all of the southern bor-
der and to replace all single 
fencing, saying he will get cor-
porate bankruptcy enthusiast 
Donald Trump to pay for it. 
He also wants this wall to be 
law enforcement-accessible 
and reinforced by technology 
including cameras, sensors, 
and monitors. He also wants 
to equip the southern border 
with biometric tracking sys-
tems. Cruz has also pledged 
to triple border patrol num-
bers with a particular focus on 
aerial surveillance.
In addition, Cruz has said 
he will reverse Obama’s “ex-
ecutive amnesty” and rescind 
permissions to stay for cur-
rent immigrants in the United 
States illegally. He also will 
cut down on H1-B visas until 
unemployment is lowered (at 
less than 5 percent, the Unit-
ed States is currently close 
to what economists call full 
employment, so it is safe to 
assume Cruz is talking about 
a permanent freeze on H1-B 
visas).
Cruz will also cut off all 
federal funds to “sanctuary 
cities,” cities that do not co-
operate with the federal gov-
ernment in deporting illegal 
immigrants who have interac-
tions with the criminal justice 
system.
Ohio Governor John 
Kasich
Kasich has said Trump’s 
plan to deport 11 million citi-
zens is unrealistic and backs a 
path to legal status for illegal 
immigrants currently in the 
United States. In both public 
appearances and at debates 
he has said illegal immigrants 
contribute a lot to America 
and has seemed disturbed by 
the idea of breaking up fami-
lies to enforce immigration 
laws.
Kasich has backed away 
from the idea that birthright 
citizenship should be ended 
and has claimed that guest 
worker programs should be 
expanded to meet the needs 
of American businesses. Ka-
sich has not ruled out a path to 
citizenship, but a path to legal 
status is central to his stance 
on immigration.
Senator Marco Rubio 
(R–FL)
Rubio once was a mem-
ber of the “Gang of Eight,” a 
group that attempted to pass a 
sweeping immigration reform 
bill that included a provision 
for a path to citizenship for 
illegal immigrants. Rubio has 
since backed away from that 
idea, claiming that it is too 
divisive in the current Ameri-
can political climate. Instead, 
he now prefers programs like 
e-verify to lower the popula-
tion of illegal immigrants in 
America. Rubio has said that 
after ten years (twice the 
length of residency required 
for citizenship), illegal immi-
grants would need to learn 
English (rather than the of-
?cial language of America, 
nothing) and undergo a back-
ground check. After passing 
those two hurdles, they would 
pay a ?ne for legal status.
The Trump Organization 
Chairman and President 
Donald Trump
Trump famously claimed 
that Mexico was sending its 
criminals across the border to 
commit crimes in the United 
States. He wants to build a 
wall along the southern bor-
der to prevent people from 
entering the country unless 
they have been outstanding, 
in which case he will allow 
them in through a “big, beau-
tiful door.” He has claimed he 
will get Mexico to pay for this 
wall despite Mexican of?cials 
claiming that such a proposi-
tion is a nonstarter. Trump has 
implied that he will impound 
remittances from illegal im-
migrants to their families in 
their home countries to force 
the hand of the Mexican gov-
ernment.
Trump has said he will 
triple the number of Immi-
gration and Customs Enforce-
ment of?cers, and mandate 
e-verify.
He will also force cities to 
detain illegal immigrants and 
return illegal immigrants with 
even misdemeanor charges to 
their countries of citizenship 
while defunding cities that do 
not comply. Trump also wants 
to commit ICE members to 
gang task forces in cities.
Trump also wants to make 
it more costly to overstay a 
visa, claiming it is a threat to 
national security as well as 
birthright citizenship, the ba-
sis of the 14th Amendment to 
the Constitution.
In order to keep more work 
with native workers, Trump 
wants to increase the prevail-
ing wage for H1-B visas to pre-
vent companies from ?lling 
positions with foreign born 
workers over Americans in 
addition to simply regulating 
that employers look for Amer-
ican citizens ?rst before hiring 
workers on visas. Trump also 
wants to freeze immigration 
and green cards temporarily 
to force employers to look at 
Americans.
Former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton
Secretary Clinton has long 
been a proponent of immi-
gration reform, backing the 
DREAM act when she was a 
Senator. She has proposed a 
path to citizenship for people 
in the country illegally and 
has backed President Obama’s 
executive action to protect 
DREAMers from deportation. 
In addition to protection from 
deportation, Secretary Clin-
ton has also proposed end-
ing private detention centers 
which she believes contrib-
utes to over-incarceration of 
immigrant families.
Clinton has also vowed to 
protect access to health care 
for all immigrants, particular-
ly children. She has also pro-
posed expanding access to fee 
waivers and English programs 
to help more people become 
naturalized.
Senator Bernie Sanders 
(I–VT)
Sanders has long been 
an advocate of border secu-
rity and contraction of the 
H2-B guest worker program 
for unskilled labor calling it 
a “Koch Brothers proposal,” 
but his focus on immigration 
has shifted from the source 
to the result. Sanders ?nds 
deportations and detention 
centers to be cruel and vows 
to end them and has occasion-
ally had a particularly sharp 
focus on LGBT immigrants. 
He has also voiced support 
for comprehensive immigra-
tion reform, though it is not 
clear exactly what form of 
immigration reform he sup-
ports beyond a “roadmap to 
citizenship.” Senator Sanders 
has also vowed to use execu-
tive action if Congress will not 
work with him.
To make things more con-
crete, in Thursday’s debate, 
Sanders threw out his past 
uneasiness with immigration 
and said there will be a path 
to citizenship for all people in 
the United States illegally if he 
is elected president.

Raise a Glass: Christie, Fiorina, Gilmore end campaigns 
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
New Hampshire has had 
its say in the presidential pri-
maries, and a few more can-
didates have decided to call it 
quits.
On Wednesday, New Jer-
sey Governor Chris Christie 
?nally decided to exit the race 
following his sixth-place ?n-
ish in New Hampshire. Once a 
highly sought-after candidate 
in 2012, and a meteoric star 
after his reelection in 2013, 
Christie has undergone more 
scrutiny for his record since 
the 2014 Bridgegate Scan-
dal saw some of his top aides 
dismissed. His reputation for 
straight talk completely van-
ished the moment business-
man Donald Trump stepped 
into the presidential spotlight. 
Perhaps the most signi?-
cant contribution Christie 
made in his campaign was 
derailing Senator Marco Ru-
bio (R–FL) during the Re-
publican debate on Feb. 6. 
Christie’s critique that Rubio 
is scripted was highlighted by 
the senator’s overly repetitive 
criticism of President Obama, 
contributing to Rubio’s ?fth-
place ?nish.
Former Hewlett Packard 
CEO Carly Fiorina also sus-
pended her campaign on 
Wednesday. Initially placed 
among the bottom tier of 
the Republican contenders, 
Fiorina stole the spotlight 
in the ?rst Republican de-
bate on Aug. 6. Though she 
was placed among the lower 
performing candidates, she 
emerged as an option for 
those looking for a politi-
cal outsider with moderate 
views. Later debate perfor-
mances failed to capture her 
initial spark, and she failed to 
pick up enough endorsements 
and donations to remain a vi-
able candidate.
On Friday, former Virginia 
governor Jim Gilmore end-
ed his long-shot bid for the 
presidency. Gilmore received 
133 votes in New Hampshire, 
more than 10 times his vote 
count in Iowa. Gilmore was 
still eclipsed by candidates 
who had already dropped out 
of the race like former Arkan-
sas governor Mike Huckabee, 
former Pennsylvania senator 
Rick Santorum, and Senator 
Rand Paul (R–KY). Gilmore 
even lost to a man named 
Andy Martin, whose claim to 
fame was alleging that Presi-
dent Obama is both a Muslim 
and the son of political activist 
Frank Marshall Davis.
Despite a few more can-
didates dropping out of the 
picture, the race for the 
Republican nomination re-
mains murky. Although the 
establishment had begun to 
coalesce around Rubio fol-
lowing his third-place ?nish 
in Iowa, his ?fth-place ?nish 
coupled with Ohio Governor 
John Kasich’s second place 
and former Florida governor 
Jeb Bush’s fourth-place ?n-
ish in New Hampshire have 
sewn confusion over who 
exactly can be the moderate 
candidate in the race, much 
like how there was a large 
debate over who the con-
servative challenger to Mitt 
Romney would be in the last 
election cycle. Rubio, Kasich, 
and Bush all have reason to 
believe they should remain 
in the race, but the political 
reality is that the Republican 
nominee will be either Sena-
tor Ted Cruz (R–TX) or Trump 
unless two of them suspend 
their campaigns soon.
For Cruz, his third-place 
?nish despite a lack of cam-
paigning in New Hampshire 
solidi?ed his position as the 
conservative choice for the 
Republican nomination.
The clock is ticking for 
neurosurgeon Ben Carson, 
the last voice trying to appeal 
to Republican voters as the 
true conservative of this elec-
tion cycle.
Trump stands in a cat-
egory all to himself, and his 
power in the race has com-
pletely turned the Republican 
nomination process upside 
down. Should moderate Re-
publicans continue to remain 
divided among Rubio, Ka-
sich, and Bush, the chances 
of a brokered convention will 
continue to increase, a pros-
pect that should delight the 
Democrats.Top: Courtesy of Mike Vadon via Wikimedia Commons. Bottom: Courtesy of Bob Jagendorf via Wikimedia Commons

New Hampshire voters call for upheaval in Washington
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staffwriter
The New Hampshire pri-
mary exposed a very deep un-
dercurrent of anger running 
through the American popu-
lace. On the GOP side, busi-
nessman Donald Trump pulled 
out a victory in which he drew 
more than twice as many votes 
as his nearest competition, 
Ohio Governor John Kasich. 
On the Democratic side, Sena-
tor Bernie Sanders (I–VT) beat 
former Secretary of State Hill-
ary Clinton by over 20 points. 
While both candidates had 
been leading the polls for quite 
some time, both managed to 
beat lofty expectations and, 
with one of the longest lulls 
in the primary schedule upon 
us, create a feeling of disarray 
in the election. In the GOP, 
Trump started out as a seem-
ingly factional candidate with 
little hope of sustaining his 
momentum. The Huf?ngton 
Post put him in the entertain-
ment section, and party elites 
never took him very seriously, 
and still don’t. There were 
very few attack ads run in ei-
ther Iowa or New Hampshire 
leading up to the contests in 
those two states. However, an 
overloaded GOP ?eld allows 
Trump’s loyal followers — a 
relatively small faction of the 
GOP — to override the over-
whelming negative sentiment 
surrounding Trump within the 
Republican Party.
The Republicans would do 
much better to take Trump 
seriously. After the Republi-
cans were surprised by their 
loss in the 2012 election, they 
found that social conservatism 
— and immigration policy 
in particular — were keep-
ing “natural conservatives” 
away from their party. They 
hoped to leave social conser-
vatism behind, but this caused 
a revolt within the party and 
caused very few people to shift 
toward the Republicans. Re-
publicans may have learned a 
lot about the opposition, but 
failed to realize that there are 
few people within their party 
who actually agree with their 
policy platform. Rather, these 
are people who culturally 
identify with the conservative 
cause. They felt completely be-
trayed when the Republicans 
abandoned them on many 
social issues, immigration in 
particular. This anger has led 
to Trump basically control-
ling the narrative of the GOP, 
which he has been doing for 
months now.
However, Trump only 
pulled in 34 percent of the 
vote, a number generally insuf-
?cient to win primaries. The 
candidate closest to Trump 
was Kasich, who pulled out a 
surprising second. Kasich has 
been running far to the left of 
both the Republican Party and 
his own record, but Kasich’s 
positive campaign has struck a 
chord with many voters. While 
this is bizarre — Kasich built 
up a reputation in the House 
of Representatives as being an 
arrogant hothead who would 
?ght anyone — with Trump 
representing little of conser-
vative orthodoxy and Sena-
tor Ted Cruz (R–TX) taking 
the “true conservative” role 
for himself, the cheerful tone 
of Kasich’s campaign could 
put him in a strong position if 
former Florida governor Jeb 
Bush joins New Jersey Gover-
nor Chris Christie in exiting 
the race. One person in the 
Republican Party who disap-
pointed on primary night was 
Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL). 
After a terrible debate perfor-
mance, Rubio managed only 
?fth place in New Hampshire, 
annihilating his stated “3-2-
1” strategy of coming third in 
Iowa, second in New Hamp-
shire, and ?rst in South Caro-
lina. Rubio has to pick up the 
pieces fast, or the support he 
has been gaining will dissipate 
quickly. On the Democratic 
side, Sanders demolished 
Clinton in a state that has been 
home to some of the most 
memorable moments in the ca-
reers of both the secretary and 
her husband, former President 
Bill Clinton. The defeat was 
not surprising. While much is 
made of the fact that Sanders 
won across all demographics, 
winning all demographics in 
New Hampshire is like count-
ing to one. Sanders has been 
leading Clinton among white, 
liberal voters for a long time. 
Those demographics match up 
with New Hampshire, which 
has one of the whitest and 
most liberal Democratic elec-
torates in the nation. Sanders’s 
ability to appeal to minority 
voters — particularly minority 
voters over age thirty — is yet 
to be seen. It is impossible to 
win the Democratic nomina-
tion with such a heavily white 
coalition, so Sanders has his 
work cut out for him, despite 
the impressive win. However, 
President Obama had a similar 
problem before his stunning 
win in Iowa, so it’s possible the 
momentum from this big of a 
win could bring many people 
to Sanders’ side.
Both parties appear to be in 
disarray after New Hampshire. 
With such a long, lazy stretch 
in primary season, this feeling 
of panic is likely to last long 
enough to create major shock-
waves in the election. With 
all of its resources, the GOP 
has been heavily in?uential in 
deciding nominees over the 
past several decades, but the 
Granite State ?exed its ?rst-in-
the-nation primary muscle on 
Tuesday and now things start 
to get interesting.

Rubio struggles with attacks on authenticity from Christie
BARBARA SAMANIEGO
Staffwriter
Chris Christie renounced 
his candidacy for president 
following a disappointing ?n-
ish in New Hampshire. He an-
nounced his decision on Face-
book saying, “I leave the race 
without an ounce of regret. 
I’m so proud of the campaign 
we ran, the people that ran 
it with me and all those who 
gave us their support and con-
?dence along the way.”
A conservative governor in 
a largely blue state, Christie 
struggled both with getting 
funds and gathering enough 
support to win the Republican 
nomination. He was attacked 
by Bush, Rubio, and Kasich on 
his state’s usage of the Com-
mon Core, the Bridgegate 
scandal, and his past stances 
on gun control and abortion. 
According to CNN, Christie’s 
campaign strategy centered 
on his survival in the primary 
rounds, rather than on acquir-
ing the numbers he needed to 
win.
Tensions between Rubio 
and Christie began to rise 
long before the New Hamp-
shire debate. According to in-
side sources, Christie planned 
to issue systematic attacks on 
Rubio during the debates.
Before the New Hampshire 
primaries, Rubio himself di-
rectly attacked Christie by 
reading a direct quote from 
Christie’s press release that 
implied Christie’s support 
of Barack Obama’s Supreme 
Court nomination of Sonia 
Sotomayor.
During the ABC debate 
in New Hampshire, Chris-
tie targeted Rubio’s lack of 
experience as a ?rst term 
senator saying, “When you’re 
president of the United 
States, when you’re a gover-
nor of a state, the memorized 
30-second speech where you 
talk about how great America 
is at the end of it doesn’t solve 
one problem for one person.”
Christie’s attack took Ru-
bio by surprise. He struggled 
to formulate an adequate re-
sponse and thus repeated the 
same speech he made a few 
minutes earlier verbatim.
Christie called him out on 
repeating memorized lines 
and highlighted again his lack 
of experience. Rubio respond-
ed by regurgitating the mem-
orized lines for a third time.
Christie was forced to 
withdraw from the race, but 
he impacted the results of the 
New Hampshire primary with 
his attack on Rubio. Rubio, 
who also encountered dif-
?culties in the latest debate, 
is working on a strategy to 
bounce back from both the 
attacks and a disappoint-
ing ?fth place ?nish in New 
Hampshire.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
On Feb. 2, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
published their recommendation 
that sexually active women who are 
not using birth control should avoid 
all alcohol consumption in order to 
reduce the prevalence of fetal alco-
hol spectrum disorders (FASDs).
The announcement, titled “Al-
cohol and Pregnancy: Why take the 
risk?” explains that individuals with 
FASDs can have lifelong physical, 
behavioral, and intellectual issues 
that severely affect their quality of 
life, and notes that 100 percent of 
FASDs are completely preventable. 
The announcement goes on to ex-
plain that over three million women 
in the U.S., despite being sexually 
active, drink alcohol without the 
safety of birth control. 
The report notes that approxi-
mately half of all pregnancies in the 
U.S. are unplanned, and that most 
planned pregnancies are not noticed 
until four to six weeks after concep-
tion, which means that if a sexually 
active woman is drinking and not on 
birth control, she could be uninten-
tionally exposing an unborn child 
to alcohol. In order to prevent this 
from happening, the CDC recom-
mends that women in this situation 
avoid alcohol altogether.
The CDC’s announcement was 
met with mixed reactions, with 
many people saying the CDC’s rec-
ommendation was impractical, sex-
ist, and condescending. Of interest 
to The Tartan, however, is the impli-
cation that the announcement has 
for the prescription of birth control 
and other pharmaceuticals in gen-
eral.
While the CDC’s announcement 
can be viewed as a call for women to 
abstain from alcohol consumption 
out of concern for their potential 
unborn child, it can also be viewed 
as a promotion for the prescription 
of birth control. The CDC notes 
that abstaining from alcohol is only 
necessary if a woman is sexually ac-
tive and not on birth control, and 
suggests that healthcare providers 
recommend birth control to women 
who are sexually active, not plan-
ning to get pregnant, and wish to 
drink alcohol. This push for all sex-
ually active women to be on birth 
control poses problems, however, 
with regard to the over-prescription 
of pharmaceuticals.
The pill, which is currently the 
most common form of contracep-
tive, was approved for use by the 
FDA in 1960, and has been the 
most commonly used contraceptive 
since 1982. Since then, the pill has 
become a widely prescribed cure-
all for a variety of issues beyond 
contraception including menstrual 
pain, acne, and endometriosis, a 
chronic disease of the uterine lining 
that causes severe pain and can lead 
to ovarian cysts, lesions, and infer-
tility. As of 2011, 58 percent of all 
pill users said they used the pill for 
noncontraceptive reasons, with 14 
percent saying they used the pill for 
only noncontraceptive reasons.
While it is undeniable that con-
traceptives like the pill provide a 
variety of bene?ts to many women, 
these types of contraceptives are 
also linked to an assortment of side 
effects. Common side effects in-
clude nausea, weight gain, and loss 
of libido. 
However, contraceptives have 
also been linked to more serious is-
sues such as strokes, heart disease, 
and mental illness. A 2007 study 
from the Alfred Psychiatry Research 
Centre in Australia, for example, 
suggests a link between contracep-
tives and depression, although the 
study itself notes that more research 
is needed to reach a de?nitive 
conclusion.
The hazards of contraceptive 
pills were brought to the forefront 
in the early 2000s when a contro-
versy exploded around Yaz, a new 
contraceptive released in 2001 by 
Bayer. The contraceptive was heav-
ily advertised, and by 2006 it was 
the number one contraceptive. 
The overnight success of Yaz was 
short-lived, however, as reports of 
the drug causing an increased risk 
of blood clots began to surface. 
While all contraceptives can cause 
blood clots — approximately two in 
every 10,000 women taking contra-
ceptives will experience a blood clot 
— studies reported to the FDA in 
2009 suggested that Yaz put women 
at increased risk. 
Once again, research on the topic 
proved frustrating, and de?nite con-
clusions were elusive. Some stud-
ies suggested that Yaz increased a 
woman’s risk of acquiring a blood 
clot by two to ?ve times, while oth-
ers suggested that there was no ex-
tra risk associated with Yaz. Various 
reports associated Yaz with approxi-
mately 100 deaths and thousands of 
injuries, although Yaz could not be 
de?nitively named as the cause.
 Bayer denied knowing anything 
about this increased risk, and was 
involved in a $20 million settle-
ment that attempted to determine 
the risk associated with the drug, 
but no de?nite conclusions were 
ever made. Today, Yaz is still on 
the market, although the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
altered the Yaz warning label to in-
clude a warning about the potential 
increased risk of blood clots.
The idea that contraceptives like 
the pill are widely accepted and 
heavily prescribed by health-care 
providers, despite the colossal un-
certainty that exists in the scienti?c 
community, raises questions about 
the safety of their prescription. 
Certainly they can provide many 
bene?ts, and could be preferable to 
unplanned pregnancy or severe dis-
orders such as endometriosis, but 
do we really know enough about 
the side effects of these drugs to 
prescribe them to teens struggling 
with acne or women with any sort 
of menstrual discomfort?
Unfortunately, the story behind 
Yaz, and contraceptives in general, 
is far from unusual. There have been 
countless instances of other phar-
maceuticals initially marketed for 
their remarkable effects that were 
later discovered to have calamitous 
side effects. Take Vioxx, for exam-
ple, a drug ?rst released in 1999 as 
a pain reliever for arthritis that was 
recalled ?ve years later after being 
linked to a signi?cant increased risk 
of heart attack and stroke. 
With an increase in pharma-
ceutical advertisements, consum-
ers are now exposed to more syn-
thetic drugs than ever before. In 
2002, pharmaceutical companies 
spent approximately $4 billion on 
pharmaceutical advertisements. 
A third of all consumers who saw 
a pharmaceutical advertisement 
asked their doctor about the drug, 
and two thirds of these individuals 
eventually asked for a prescription. 
Since then, pharmaceutical adver-
tisements have only increased, with 
many consumers gaining most or all 
of their information about pharma-
ceutical drugs from advertisements.
This is not to say that prescrip-
tion drugs shouldn’t exist. The phar-
maceutical industry helps billions of 
people deal with illnesses that could 
be crippling or life threatening with-
out the aid of synthetic medication, 
but consumers need to be educated 
about all the risks and bene?ts as-
sociated with these drugs. Phar-
maceutical drugs can have serious 
side effects; these drugs should be 
viewed with caution and used only

Mental illness is a hard thing to 
talk about. It’s dif?cult because a 
person’s mental health is so incred-
ibly personal and often a source of 
shame. What we’ve seen recently 
is that people are trying to be more 
open about having mental health 
conversations and discussing men-
tal health care options. While this 
is really important, it’s also quite 
obvious that we’re far from where 
we need to be, and cultural per-
ceptions and popular psychology 
assumptions around self care can 
add obstacles to improving the so-
cial support for people with mental 
illnesses
In my experience, one of the 
most prominent points of frustra-
tion for people with mental illnesses 
is the umbrella prescription of med-
itation and yoga for every disorder. 
This tends to be a well-intentioned 
recommendation, but it also tends 
to be invalidating. It is worth un-
packing the application of yoga and 
mindfulness in a clinical setting to 
explain why this can come across as 
insensitive.
Yoga and meditation interven-
tions are increasingly becoming 
topics of interests in clinical and 
health psychology. Several studies 
have suggested that mindfulness 
based therapies for depression and 
anxiety are as effective as medica-
tion in both the short and long term. 
Mindfulness interventions have also 
been shown to lower cortisol levels 
and decrease blood pressure. It is 
connected with improved self-reg-
ulation, and researchers are cur-
rently investigating its potential for 
reducing high risk behavior in chil-
dren and adolescents. Research has 
also found that mindfulness tends 
to be most effective in high stress 
populations, which makes it prom-
ising for clinical social work.
This is just a broad overview of 
the body of mindfulness research, 
and scientists are working on iden-
tifying the speci?c mechanisms at 
play in mindfulness meditation, as 
well as its limitations. Mindfulness 
is de?ned by an observation and 
an acceptance of experiences, so it 
can really be taught and practiced 
in a wide variety of situations. The 
wide range of practices is signi?-
cant because in a clinical setting, 
meditation and yoga interventions 
are going to be very different from 
the classes at a generic yoga studio. 
Consider the dif?culty a person suf-
fering with a mental illness faces 
entering a space of slim, upper-
middle class, Lululemon-wearing 
women to deal with their most per-
sonal problems. While all practices 
of yoga should include the cogni-
tive portion of mindfulness, this 
component looks very different in a 
clinical setting, both in content and 
culture.
Part of this difference is a modi-
?cation of language that could be 
triggering to people with mental ill-
nesses. There are also certain parts 
of mediation are going to actually 
be more harmful than helpful. For 
example, a traditional mindful 
practice might include sitting with 
an emotion with your eyes closed in 
silence for long periods of time. This 
means that you take time to be pres-
ent and allow yourself to experience 
your emotions fully, without judge-
ment or trying to change it. This 
would not work for everyone, and 
certainly not for someone dealing 
with severe mental illnesses where 
certain emotions can be damaging 
or scary. This means that included 
in the diverse practices of mindful-
ness are therapies designed for spe-
ci?c disorders. Furthermore, these 
therapies often use mindfulness as 
a component of the treatment plan 
rather than the sole focus.
Because mental illnesses are so 
complicated, with a multitude of 
in?uences from environmental, to 
genetic, to hormonal, treatment 
plans usually require a diverse ap-
proach. Medication can be a part of 
someone’s treatment — sometimes 
it is a necessary step — but gener-
ally doctors also work with lifestyle 
and cognitive changes. A therapist 
and psychiatrist works with their 
clients to ?gure out what strategies 
work best, and this may not include 
yoga or meditation in the tradition-
al sense. In therapies such as dia-
lectical behavioral therapy, the idea 
behind mindfulness is incorporated 
in more subtle ways than breathing 
exercises and downward dog. What 
that boils down to is the idea that 
mindful meditation is just a tool in 
a toolbox of strategies to deal with 
psychological distress, and it may 
not be useful for everyone.
The “Well, have you tried yoga?” 
question comes across as thought-
less when it doesn’t take into consid-
eration how recovery is complicated 
and sometimes not the current goal. 
Mindfulness, yoga, exercise, diet, 
and sleep are all important for stress 
management and mood, but they 
are not cure-all remedies for every 
disease. Suggesting lifestyle chang-
es like taking up yoga or getting a 
full night’s sleep to someone with 
severe mental disorders is insensi-
tive not only because problematic 
sleep patterns or discomfort in your 
body that can make yoga triggering 
are part of the disorder, but it also 
implies that disorders can be cured 
by trying harder.
People often see those with 
mental illness as weak, lazy, or 
attention-seeking, and that has a 
serious impact on how they seek 
out treatment. Because of this, it’s 
important to be careful about pro-
viding support in a way that doesn’t 
blame people for their mental ill-
ness. There is not a one size ?ts all 
approach to being supportive and 
discussing mental health care. What 
is relatable and relevant will change 
from person to person. It it is im-
portant to have conversations about 
ways you can take care of your men-
tal health, especially considering 
that 20 percent of Americans have 
never even tried stress reducing ac-
tivities. But a good place to start is 
listening ?rst to what someone is 
actually going through and working 
with them, based on their resources 
and needs, to ?nd the best next step 
whether that is treatment, a consul-
tation, a lifestyle change, or a mind-
fulness based intervention.

Cultural appropriation is a very 
complicated topic, despite what 
many seem to think. There is no 
clear black and white distinction 
between right and wrong here — it 
is all a gray area. The gray is some-
thing that I think gets lost in a lot of 
the debates surrounding the issue. 
You cannot clearly de?ne lines be-
tween what is correct and what is 
not when it comes to taking things 
from another culture. When is it ap-
propriative, and when is it just ex-
change?
One of the most recent contro-
versies about this issue was the new 
Coldplay and Beyoncé video: For 
some reason, Beyoncé got all of the 
?ak for something that was mostly 
Coldplay’s doing.
The video for their new song, 
“Hymn for the Weekend,” is set in 
India, with all of the stereotypes of 
India and Indians that the Western 
world likes to place on us. Chris 
Martin and his band run through 
colored powder in a ready-made 
Holi festival, past Hindu gurus in 
their orange attire, and past chil-
dren dressed up as Hindu gods. It 
features Beyoncé as a Bollywood 
heroine, singing on the big screen 
in front of throngs of Indian people, 
covered with more Western ideas of 
what Indian fashion and headwear 
look like. 
As soon as the video came out, 
hordes of people, both Indian and 
non-Indian, condemned Beyoncé 
for her culturally appropriative 
fashion choices, but there was much 
less of a backlash against the video 
itself.
The thing to consider, however, is 
that cultural appropriation is about 
power — it’s not just people wear-
ing things from other cultures. Cul-
tural appropriation is what happens 
when people are lionized and pro?t-
ing from donning a part of another 
race’s culture, while members of the 
race or culture are ostracized and 
othered for doing the same things. 
This is especially evident in Iggy 
Azalea’s video “Bounce” and Selena 
Gomez’s “Come and Get It.” There 
are also everyday examples of white 
girls wearing henna and bindis who 
get praised for being hip and trendy 
while Indian girls and woman wear-
ing henna and bindi’s are not.
This power dynamic does not ex-
ist here — Beyoncé, as a black per-
son, has no structural power over 
South Asians in America. She was 
invited to participate in the video, 
she made none of the artistic design 
choices, and had none of the power 
there either. The issue with this vid-
eo is more Chris Martin and his band 
white-girling their way through In-
dia and upholding all of the tired, 
old stereotypes of my country, than 
it is Beyoncé in the vaguely Indian 
headgear and fashion.
South Asians are very frequently 
extremely anti-black as a culture as 
well, and this is incredibly evident 
in the way that I’ve seen the back-
lash against Beyoncé go so far be-
yond the backlash for the video in 
its entirety, which was much more 
harmful than Beyoncé’s attire.
The way that Chris Martin and 
Coldplay aestheticized hundreds of 
years of Indian culture and history 
is signi?cantly more damaging to 
the way that South Asians are por-
trayed in the Western mind than 
Beyoncé participating in this video 
while wearing vaguely Indian at-
tire. The only things that the West-
ern world knows about India or its 
culture are fun colors, dark-skinned 
orphans, and caricatures of Hindu 
gods and goddesses, and this video 
does nothing to subvert that. In fact, 
it encouraged those ideas. The salt 
in the wound is that the song itself 
had absolutely nothing to do with 
India — there was absolutely no 
reason for this video to be set in that 
country or have any of the scenes of 
India that it did.
The controversy surrounding 
the cultural appropriation of this 
video is not taking into account the 
real issue of cultural appropriation, 
which is the question of who has the 
power in this situation. It’s not Be-
yoncé, and it’s not South Asians. It’s 
Coldplay. That’s the conversation 
we should be having, not discussing 
whether or not Beyoncé’s attire — 
that, again, she didn’t choose her-
self — was or wasn’t appropriative.

My mom can ?y an airplane. This 
is a fact that I gleefully share with 
anyone who is willing to listen, not 
only because I think it’s a very excit-
ing skill to hone, but also because 
I love the story behind it. When 
my mom had just ?nished her un-
dergraduate studies, she planned 
to enlist in the Air Force to pay for 
medical school. The United States 
Military would pay for her schooling 
and then she would serve as a doctor 
and pilot for four years to pay back 
her dues. It was a plan she had all 
ready to go until her boyfriend at the 
time, soon to be her ?ancé, and later 
my father, talked her out of it. He 
was worried about her, and he did 
not want anything bad to happen to 
the woman he loved. It is a sweet and 
romantic story, but one that is com-
plex and intriguing, especially given 
the new developments with regards 
to women in the military.
My mother had a choice in decid-
ing if she wanted to pursue a military 
career. She ended up not doing so, 
but what if my mother didn’t had the 
option to say no and was drafted? 
It is strange to imagine how my life 
would have been different if this oc-
curred, or even if this was possibility 
back then. But what was once only 
speculative is now an emerging pos-
sibility for young women today, and 
is a topic that should not be ignored.
Women have long played an im-
portant role during wartime, from 
taking charge on the homefront by 
?lling men’s jobs left vacant from 
the draft, to serving in war zones 
as cooks and nurses, to, more re-
cently, serving in combat roles on 
the front lines. However, women 
and men have been unequal in 
military service up until this past 
December when the United States 
Secretary of Defense, Ashton B. 
Carter, announced that all combat 
roles will now be open to women. 
This includes all ?ve branches of the 
United States military and all of their 
special forces. Men and women are 
now equal on the battle?eld. This is 
an enormous step in gender equality 
and a huge win for feminists; there 
is one little thing that many people 
have forgotten about, however, and 
that is Selective Service, more com-
monly known as the draft.
It is a topic we all have a tendency 
to ignore as there has not been a draft 
since the early 1970s, but it is a valid 
and important topic. It is astound-
ing how ?ustered Republican candi-
dates were at last week’s GOP debate 
when asked “Should young women 
be required to sign up for selective 
service?” Candidates were at a loss 
for words. This was not a question 
they had been expecting. But really, 
why not? It is an extremely relevant 
subject given the fact that women 
have now been fully integrated into 
the United States military service. If 
women are now fully equal to men 
in the military, why should this not 
extend to conscription?
The responses of the candidates 
were appalling. Skewed logic, eva-
sion of the question at hand, and 
blatant dismissal of the question 
abounded. In fact, Jeb Bush ?atly 
stated “the draft is not going to be 
reinstated.” Without omniscient 
knowledge of the future, he cannot 
make that claim. Many argue that 
the draft should be reinstated for 
the con?icts our country is dealing 
with today. This clear and utter dis-
regard of the topic is the true issue 
at hand here. A GOP debate is the 
place where these dif?cult questions 
are supposed to be discussed, yet the 
issue was dismissed.
All things being equal, it is not 
fair if women are not required to reg-
ister for Selective Service when their 
male counterparts are. Yes, maybe 
Jeb Bush is right and there will never 
be another draft and this whole con-
versation will prove irrelevant in a 
literal sense, but on an ideological 
level it is an important discussion to 
have, and let us not forget it is possi-
ble that we may have another draft.
We cannot live in a world of fan-
tastical hypotheticals. To state that 
men and women are equal in military 
service, they must be equal in every 
sense, which includes the draft.

Women joining draft next front in war on military sexism 
Alabama: a vital yet forgotten U.S. history
ZEKE ROSENBERG
This past Tuesday, Feb. 9, people 
?ocked from far and wide to New 
Orleans in search of plastic beads 
among other, more decadent indul-
gences to celebrate the beginning of 
the Lenten season. But did you know 
the ?rst American Mardi Gras was 
celebrated in Mobile, Alabama?
No. Of course you didn’t. Ala-
bama lives mostly in a Lynyrd Sky-
nyrd song. In FX’s You’re the Worst, 
Lindsay even refers to Jimmy’s less 
than pleasant family as “Alabama 
English people.” In our cultural con-
sciousness, Alabama is basically a 
stand in for gun-toting hicks.
It’s time for that to change.
The state of Alabama has been 
the centerpiece of many societies 
throughout its history. Mobile was 
the home of the ?rst Mardi Gras 
because it was the capital of French 
Louisiana from 1702 to 1720 due 
to its strategic positioning as a salt-
water port on the Gulf Coast. While 
Alabama has not always housed the 
capital of the societies it was part of, 
it has always stood out in the Ameri-
can south as a vital home to many 
social movements, becoming a capi-
tal to all of them in its own way.
Alabama was ceded from France 
to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, 
at which point Britain allowed Jew-
ish people to enter the territory for 
the ?rst time since it was colonized 
by France. Communities of Sephard-
ic Jews were able to establish trad-
ing posts and the largest antebel-
lum Jewish settlement in America 
was located in Mobile, Alabama. 
The most famous settler is Abraham 
Mordecai, who came in 1785. Mor-
decai believed the Native Americans 
were members of the lost tribe of Is-
rael, so he felt a connection to them 
and preferred to negotiate on their 
terms rather than trying to forcibly 
expand Alabaman territory. During 
the Civil War, Jews largely migrat-
ed north — an order from General 
Ulysses S. Grant for all Jewish peo-
ple to evacuate his military district 
was a large reason for the mass mi-
gration. However, that settlement in 
Mobile was one of the ?rst instances 
of America’s Jewish community, one 
that continues to thrive.
Nearly one hundred years after 
the Civil War and only 61 years ago, 
Alabama became one of the most 
prominent battlegrounds in the Civ-
il Rights Movement. These events 
are all well-known and incredibly 
important historical moments, but 
don’t seem to resonate when people 
talk about Alabama. Rosa Parks’ re-
fusal to give up her seat to a white 
passenger occurred in Montgom-
ery, Alabama in 1955 along with 
the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. wrote the Let-
ter from Birmingham Jail in 1963 
and led the Selma to Montgomery 
marches with James Bevel, Hosea 
Williams, and John Lewis.
Even before the Civil Rights 
Movement hit its peak, Alabama was 
home to large-scale racial activism. 
Julius Rosenwald’s schools, which 
were funded in part by donations 
from Andrew Carnegie, attempted 
to remedy the stark disparities be-
tween opportunities of black and 
white students in the early 1900s.
All of this is without even men-
tioning the Native American tribes 
who occupied the land before 
France and have reason to call the 
state home, even if their families 
have been separated from the land 
for generations.
Of course, Alabama has had its 
demons in the past. Montgomery 
was the ?rst Confederate capital; ra-
cial terrorism ran rampant for much 
of the state’s history; former gov-
ernor George Wallace campaigned 
for president based on expanding 
segregation as recently as 1968; 
and President Andrew Jackson’s In-
dian Removal Act devastated Native 
American tribes living in the state. 
The centuries of violence and strife 
are important to a meaningful ex-
amination of the state’s history. This 
article is not a meaningful examina-
tion of anything, just a call to atten-
tion for a state that provided some 
of the most visible front lines for this 
nation’s deepest and most violent 
existential crises since the Civil War.
Given its past, it is frustrating 
that the history of the Yellowham-
mer State often gets condensed into 
being a breeding ground for stereo-
types of bible-belt rednecks (Then 
again I said New Hampshire only 
had one demographic in this same 
issue, so I’m a hypocrite). The ties 
Mardi Gras has to Alabama offers 
an opportunity to examine the state 
with one of the most complicated 
legacies in a nation that is itself 
wrapped in a complicated legacy.

As humans, we have in-
vested in the development 
of computers to automate 
the world around us in order 
to increase ef?ciency and 
the reach of human under-
standing. While computers 
can seamlessly make a large 
number of computations 
very quickly, the machines 
are little competition for the 
the biological machines we 
?nd in nature, like the brain. 
A developing research area 
in computer science is fo-
cused on better understand-
ing biology and using the 
insights for algorithm devel-
opment. Following this path, 
Carnegie Mellon researcher 
Tai-Sing Lee, a professor in 
the Computer Science De-
partment and the Center for 
the Neural Basis of Cogni-
tion (CNBC), will attempt to 
reverse-engineer the brain 
in order to try and reveal its 
learning methods and apply 
them to advancing machine 
learning algorithms. The 
project will span ?ve years 
and will cost roughly $12 
million.
The human brain is made 
up of many small units called 
neurons that send messages 
to each other through a 
massive network of electri-
cal impulses. These mes-
sages mediate all the func-
tions the brain conveys to 
the rest of the body, which 
range from actions such as 
interpreting the scenes in a 
video to moving your hand. 
While scientists don’t fully 
understand all the intrica-
cies in a neurons’ function-
ing, biologists have gained 
a breadth of understanding 
in recent decades. Recent 
data has been starting to 
uncover that these neurons 
are highly interconnected 
and may even participate in 
feedback loops, leading to a 
very complex system. While 
biologists have been hard at 
work uncovering the secrets 
of the brain, computer sci-
entists have been busy with 
the advancement of machine 
learning, which has seen a 
remarkable growth within 
the past decade. The main 
goal behind machine learn-
ing is to use a computer to 
interpret patterns with the 
data it receives to generate 
a computational model and 
use the model to make fur-
ther predictions given new 
data. The models can also 
evolve with new data and be-
come more robust. Machine 
learning algorithms have 
been responsible for many 
recent advancements such as 
genomic analysis, the power 
behind large-scale big data, 
and even self-driving cars.
Recent development of 
new technologies has made 
it possible to collect large 
amounts of data regarding 
the brain’s activity, and more 
importantly, to be able to 
analyze that data and make 
important conclusions. One 
of the main goals of Lee’s 
project is to create a large 
data repository which rep-
resents neural circuitry. In 
order to do this, Lee is col-
laborating with investigators 
at Cold Spring Harbor Labo-
ratory, MIT, and Columbia 
University. This repository 
will then be available for 
other researchers around to 
world to conduct their own 
analysis. In addition, Lee 
will collaborate with Sandra 
Kuhlman, assistant profes-
sor of biological sciences at 
Carnegie Mellon and the 
CNBC, and Alan Yuille, the 
Bloomberg Distinguished 
Professor of Cognitive Sci-
ence and Computer Science 
at Johns Hopkins University, 
to analyze their data.
A technique already used 
in machine learning is one 
of neural nets: algorithms 
based on simple units like 
neurons that share informa-
tion, or in this case data, 
with each other and make 
Nitrous engines are hot, fast, & furious
NAVIYA SINGLA
Staffwriter
From The Fast and the Fu-
rious to the myriad racing 
games presently available, 
hyper-fast cars are a common 
sight in today’s media. While 
the portrayal of such technol-
ogy may be a bit unrealistic in 
popular media, the technolo-
gy isn’t ?ctional and has quite 
a few real-world applications. 
One of the most common ap-
plications of a nitrous engine 
is to improve a car’s perfor-
mance by ?tting it with a ni-
trous system. This drastically 
increases a vehicle’s potential 
speed by using nitrous oxide 
to supplement the combus-
tion of fuel in a car’s engine. 
Nitrous systems are used in 
both competitive racing and 
modulated personal driving.
To understand how exactly 
nitrous systems work, it helps 
to be familiar with the work-
ings of an internal combustion 
engine. The internal combus-
tion engine uses the energy re-
leased from the combustion of 
fuel to do physical work, like 
make the car’s wheel turn. 
At a very basic level, think 
of an internal combustion 
engine as a syringe whose 
plunger rhythmically moves 
up and down.
The system consists of an 
ignition chamber or cylinder 
where the fuel burns, an in-
let valve that releases a fuel-
air mixture into the chamber, 
a piston that moves up and 
down, a sparking plug that ig-
nites the ?ammable mixture, 
and an exit valve that expels 
the products of combustion 
from the chamber.
First, the piston is drawn 
out and the inlet valve opens, 
causing a mixture of fuel and 
air to ?ll the chamber. The ra-
tio of fuel to air is especially 
important for ef?cient com-
bustion and is maintained by 
a device called the carbure-
tor. Then, the piston pushes 
back up, which compresses 
the mixture and increases 
its ?ammability. The spark 
plug then sharply “sets ?re” 
(exponentially raises the tem-
perature in a very short time) 
to the mixture, allowing it to 
combust, and therefore push 
the piston back down again. 
Finally, the exit valve opens, 
releasing all the products of 
combustion, which causes 
the piston to go back up once 
again. This process repeats 
over and over again to “pow-
er” the car.
Combustion is the primary 
driving force of a car, so an 
increase in the ef?ciency or 
amount of this combustion 
would cause more energy to 
be released.There are two 
types of nitrous systems: wet 
and dry. In both systems, ni-
trous oxide and fuel are fed 
into the combustion cham-
ber. The difference lies in how 
these substances are fed: A 
wet system injects a vaporous 
mixture of fuel and nitrous 
oxide into the chamber, while 
a dry system injects the two 
separately. Nitrous oxide, also 
known as “laughing gas,” is 
an excellent producer of oxy-
gen gas, which is essential for 
combustion. In the chamber, 
since there is an increase in 
the amount of oxygen as com-
pared to a regular air-fuel mix-
ture, there is also more space 
for fuel. Thus, additional 
fuel and oxygen increase the 
amount of combustion that 
takes place, thereby increas-
ing the power delivered by the 
engine by half a horsepower 
on average. In this sense, 
power is the amount of work 
done in unit time. Essentially, 
the faster a car is going, the 
more power, or horsepower, 
it needs to keep its wheels 
spinning at that speed. How-
ever, this technology is not 
all fun and games — there 
can be quite a few repercus-
sions. First, internal combus-
tion engines heat up due to 
the high temperature gases 
inside them, so using a nitrous 
system simply increases the 
temperatures even more. This 
increases the probability that 
your engine will overheat.
Drivers must only ?t their 
cars with nitrous systems 
after understanding the me-
chanical boundaries of their 
engines. The high tempera-
tures in the engine also in-
crease the possibility of early 
ignition (i.e., ignition of the 
mixtures before the sparking 
plug ignites it). This can do 
severe damage to the internal 
systems of a car. Furthermore, 
insurance companies are more 
likely to object to the idea of 
insuring a car with a nitrous 
system attached to it.
Therefore, while nitrous 
engines certainly improve 
a car’s performance, the 
technology comes with its 
own risks and bene?ts that 
need to be carefully weighed 
before use.

Wintering warblers sing during winter, practice for spring
Great reed warblers ?ee 
their European homelands 
during the colder months to 
winter in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
While there, the birds are re-
ported to spend much of their 
time singing. 
For many bird species, 
singing is the method by 
which mates are selected. 
However, birds do not tend to 
mate during migratory sea-
sons, so this frequent singing 
has perplexed researchers for 
some time. 
Singing creates a 50 per-
cent increase in energy con-
sumption for the reed warbler 
compared to the birds’ rest-
ing state. In addition, it risks 
catching predator attention 
and cuts down on time that 
could be spent foraging. The 
dedication these birds give 
to their musical endeavors  
serves to show how important 
and vital the mating process 
is. They will go against ef?-
cient biological imperatives, 
such as preserving their en-
ergy and staying out of poten-
tial predators’ sights just to 
practice singing.
The warbler’s song con-
sists of a composition made 
up of 40–60 possible sounds 
and has been described as 
“very harsh-sounding and 
creaking.” While initially ex-
pected to constitute a terri-
tory defense, the warblers’ 
winter song is now thought to 
be a rehearsal for the spring-
time, so that once mating sea-
son comes around, the war-
bler will be better prepared to 
woo potential mates.

Babylonians utilized advanced math to chart moon, Jupiter
Ancient tablets recov-
ered from Babylonian dig 
sites show that Babylonians 
using geometric methods 
to chart astronomical in-
formation more than 1,000 
years before these methods 
were previously thought to 
be developed. Many Baby-
lonian tablets are inscribed 
with calculations relating to 
the moon or the planets, but 
these are mostly based off of 
addition and other simple 
arithmetic. Out of the hun-
dreds of tablets, there were 
?ve which researchers took 
a more in-depth interest in. 
These tablets recorded what 
researchers call “trapezoid 
procedures,” named so be-
cause of the references to 
four-sided shapes with two 
parallel lines of differing 
sizes. The tablets were trans-
lated by Mathieu Ossendri-
jver, a historian of ancient 
science at the Humboldt 
University of Berlin, who de-
termined that the ?fth tablet 
contained nearly complete 
instructions for carrying out 
these trapezoid procedures. 
The Babylonian astrono-
mers were able to chart the 
change in Jupiter’s velocity 
over a 120-day interval using 
trapezoidal graphs. Similar 
methods were used in the 14th 
century by British and French 
scholars, but Ossendrijver 
says that the Babylonians pio-
neered those methods. These 
?ndings are just one of many 
mathematical histories which 
rede?ne our idea of past-era 
human intelligence.

Different howling dialects between different species
The largest quantitative 
study of wolves’ howling 
patterns was able to de?ne 
the ways in which wolf spe-
cies howl. Some wolf species 
howl more than others, and 
researchers believe that this 
could represent an evolution-
ary thread in the development 
of our own speech patterns 
and use of language. This 
study was also the ?rst of its 
kind to utilize machine learn-
ing techniques. Researchers 
used computer algorithms to 
create an index of 21 different 
howl types, based on a sample 
of 2000 different howls. The 
large sample was analyzed 
based on factors such as pitch 
and ?uctuation. Researchers 
found that the types of howls 
being uttered by different 
species, across a range from 
?at to highly modulated, were 
largely correlated to the spe-
cies of wolf. 
Wolf packs are a close 
social analogue for human 
social structures, and by un-
derstanding the communica-
tion patterns of these similar 
social structures, research-
ers will be able to “uncover 
evolutionary trajectories that 
led to more complex commu-
nications in the past, even-
tually leading to our own 
linguistic ability,” said Arik 
Kershenbaum, a research fel-
low in the Cambridge’s De-
partment of Zoology and the 
study’s lead researcher. 
The evolution of com-
munication is a burgeoning 
research ?eld, bright with

Less apprehension, more reward shown in cocaine users
A novel study, published 
in Addiction Biology, contains 
evidence that cocaine us-
ers show signs of alternative 
brain functioning; compared 
to average people, cocaine 
users have lower-function-
ing inhibition pathways and 
higher functioning reward re-
sponses. In the study, cocaine 
users engaged in a gambling 
activity while brain measure-
ments were simultaneously 
taken. Cocaine users showed 
hyperactivity in the ventral 
striatum, the brain’s “reward 
system,” whether they won or 
lost money. 
This hypersensitivity was 
accompanied by a strange 
activation of the prefron-
tal cortex, a brain region 
heavily involved in higher-
level decision-making and 
regulating behavior. 
One of the biggest roles of 
the prefrontal cortex is to in-
hibit impulsive behaviors, to 
which the reward pathway, 
the ventral striatum, responds 
well. The results showed 
that cocaine users have a 
hyperactive reward pathway 
and a largely indifferent regu-
latory pathway, which means 
that cocaine users’ brains do 
not respond to the adverse 
effects of their behavior (e.g. 
losing money). This does not 
mean, however, that cocaine 
users are completely driven 
by reward stimulation and 
cannot make rational deci-
sions; it simply means that 
they have higher susceptibil-
ity to addictive or pleasurable 
actions.

Scientists stumped over the origin of unique human trait
Evolutionary arguments 
can explain many things, but 
chins are not among them. 
This question may seem 
strange or even irrelevant, but 
if you consider that humans 
are the only animals with 
chins, a great many questions 
begin to arise. 
“In some way, it seems 
trivial, but a reason why chins 
are so interesting is we’re the 
only ones who have them,”
Nathan Holton, who stud-
ies craniofacial features and 
mechanics at the University 
of Iowa, said. “It’s unique to 
us.” In fact, one of the ways 
by which archaeologists dif-
ferentiate neanderthal skulls 
from those of modern hu-
mans is whether or not the 
skull has a chin. The “chin,” is 
a bony protrusion of the man-
dible, or the jawbone. One 
of the reasons chin-origin is 
interesting is that it “implies 
that there was some sort of 
behavioral or dietary shift 
between Neanderthals and 
anatomically modern humans 
that caused the chin to form,” 
said Zaneta Thayer, an an-
thropologist and biologist re-
searcher from the University 
of Colorado, Denver. 
One theory for why chins 
became necessary is that they 
help us chew food by dealing 
with the stresses of chewing. 
This explanation, however, is 
not robust, considering most 
of what we eat is cooked — 
not dif?cult to consume. No-
body can form a truly robust 
theory for the ori-chin of this 
uniquely human trait.

Unnatural selection causes man-made changes in species
Human activity may be 
affecting animal popula-
tions more than previously 
thought. 
Rather than simply eat-
ing our fellow creatures, re-
searchers at the University of 
California Santa Cruz, led by 
Dr. Eric Palkovacs, are ?nding 
that “unnatural selection,” 
or the idea that human be-
havior rather than nature 
itself is causing adaptation 
within organisms, is becom-
ing an increasingly prevalent 
phenomenon. 
This new development 
in evolution is beginning to 
shape much of the wildlife 
we encounter on a daily basis. 
His research focuses on large 
?sh and the ocean ecosystem: 
since larger ?sh are removed 
during ?shing practices, the 
natural population has be-
come smaller because the 
genes for largeness have been 
unnaturally “bred out.” 
General examples of 
unnatural selection are com-
mercial agricultural and 
hunting practices, which tend 
to favor the fatter, bigger, 
better specimens. 
Another example is anti-
biotic treatments which im-
pose an immense selection 
pressure on certain bacteria, 
providing massive bene?ts 
to those who can resist. Ur-
banization is also a massive 
environmental constraint we 
are placing on wildlife. Urban 
environments breed animals 
able to survive them.

Everyone gets stressed, and 
we all deal with our stress in 
different ways — meditation, 
exercise, or eating chocolate, 
to name a few examples. But 
new research out of Carnegie 
Mellon’s psychology depart-
ment shows that mindful-
ness meditation, a state of 
focusing on the present and 
interacting nonjudgementally 
with thoughts, may physically 
change your brain and help 
you feel better.
Mindfulness meditation is 
a form of focus exercise that 
can take many forms, but a 
common one involves sitting 
upright with closed eyes and 
focusing on breathing. When 
the mind wanders, one pas-
sively acknowledges thoughts 
and returns to focus on breath-
ing. The idea is to focus on 
the present moment instead 
of thinking about the past 
or the future. Over the past 
few decades, research into 
mindfulness meditation has 
shown that it helps improve a 
broad range of stress-related 
physical health, disease, and 
psychiatric outcomes, such 
as depression and anxiety, 
but little is known about the 
neurobiological mechanisms 
behind these positive health 
outcomes. A new study pub-
lished in Biological Psychiatry 
and led by David Creswell, an 
associate professor of psychol-
ogy in the Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social Sci-
ences, shows that mindfulness 
meditation reduces interleu-
kin-6, a biomarker of systemic 
in?ammation, in high-stress, 
unemployed adults more so 
than simple relaxation tech-
niques. “Not only did we show 
that mindfulness meditation 
training could reduce a health 
biomarker of in?ammation, 
but we also showed what 
mindfulness training-related 
brain changes drove these 
bene?cial health effects,” Cre-
swell said.For the study, the 
research team randomly se-
lected 35 stressed adults who 
were seeking employment. 
Half of the subjects under-
went an intensive three-day 
mindfulness meditation re-
treat program, while the other 
half underwent a relaxation 
retreat program. Both before 
and after the retreat programs, 
?ve-minute resting brain scans 
of the subjects were taken. 
Blood samples were taken be-
fore the retreat program and 
at a four-month follow-up 
appointment. At this four-
month follow up, it was noted 
by the researchers that those 
who underwent mindfulness 
meditation training showed 
reduced circulating levels of 
interleukin-6 as compared to 
those who experienced relax-
ation training.
“This ?nding suggests that 
mindfulness meditation train-
ing may decrease biomarkers 
of in?ammatory disease risk 
in populations who have el-
evated in?ammation (such as 
stressed unemployed adults),” 
the study concludes. “Little 
is known about how behav-
ioral interventions, such as 
mindfulness meditation train-
ing, can impact the brain 
and physical health. We pro-
vide the ?rst well-controlled 
evidence that three days of 
mindfulness meditation train-
ing increases resting state 
functional connectivity of the 
default mode network with 
neural regions important in 
executive control (left dorso-
lateral prefrontal cortex), and 
that these resting state func-
tional connectivity changes 
statistically mediate improve-
ments in circulating levels of 
IL-6 at follow-up.” Ultimately, 
Gun violence & accidents preventable with smart technology?
THATCHER MONTGOMERY 
Contributing Editor
Last week’s Pugwash meet-
ing focused on what technol-
ogy can add to weapons in the 
realm of smart guns. The topic 
was not gun rights, but instead 
how technology could be used 
to overcome ethical issues sur-
rounding gun rights.
You may have heard of 
the Internet of Things, the 
idea that we can connect ob-
jects, even mundane ones, to 
technology in order to make 
them function more effectively. 
When applied to ?rearms, this 
can lead to safety features like 
thumbprint scanners or other 
locking mechanisms; other po-
tential features are increased 
capabilities like advanced aim-
ing features or being able to ad-
just bullet velocity.
At ?rst glance, some of 
the safety features seem like 
no-brainers. Adding a ?nger-
print scanner to a gun would 
make it so only the authorized 
user could shoot it, making it 
impossible for stolen or ill-got-
ten guns to be used. 
Similarly, adding a safety 
that could only be unlocked 
with a Radio Frequency Iden-
ti?cation (RFID) chip, which 
uses electromagnetic ?elds 
to identify people or objects, 
would make it harder for unin-
tended users to ?re guns. In ad-
dition to just preventing illegal 
guns from shooting, these 
features would make it harder 
for accidents to happen in the 
home, as children wouldn’t be 
able to ?re guns even if they 
were able to access them.
Another possible smart gun 
technology would provide a 
GPS tracker and a log of all 
shots ?red by a gun, with the 
opportunity to have an alert 
sent to the owner of the gun. 
This would help keep track of 
where guns are and make it 
easier to respond to shootings, 
accidental or not.
However, all of these high-
tech solutions come with their 
own problems. To start with, 
there is absolutely no chance 
any of this would become man-
datory. All of the older guns 
without smart tech will remain 
out in the world, and even if 
the technology comes to the 
market, there is no political 
will to make the smart guns the 
only gun. Smart guns also cost 
more, and those with safety 
features have faced heavy op-
position from the National Ri-
?e Association and private gun 
owners. While the NRA isn’t 
explicitly against smart guns, 
they are against many of the 
safety features that take away 
the very thing that attracts 
people to guns. Many gun own-
ers see guns as an ultimate de-
fense, as something that they 
can rely on to stop an intruder 
or protect themselves. By mak-
ing it more dif?cult to use the 
gun, the technology takes 
away the certainty a gun offers.
Thumbprint scanners re-
quire clean hands and no 
gloves, neither of which are 
guaranteed. If a gun owner for-
gets their RFID chip, then they 
won’t be able to unlock their 
gun to use it. Also, if the RFID 
chips have a large-enough 
range, they don’t function for 
their very purpose: a chip in 
a homeowner’s pocket could 
allow an intruder to turn the 
homeowner’s gun against 
them, or keeping the chip in 
the same room or same area 
could still allow children to ac-
cidentally ?re guns.
Any extra level of complex-
ity in ?ring a gun takes away 
from its purpose of being a re-
sponse to a life-or-death situa-
tion. While purely mechanical 
guns can jam, adding layers of 
technology on top only makes 
it more likely something will go 
wrong. As one Pugwash mem-
ber put it, gun owners don’t 
want their guns crashing as of-
ten as their phones.
Even if they aren’t feasible 
among private owners, could 
these technologies be used for 
the police? It seems like the 
answer to that question is no, 
for the same reasons civilian 
gun owners don’t want smart 
guns. If a smart gun were to 
lock up or glitch and endan-
ger someone’s life because a 
police of?cer couldn’t ?re it, 
that would be a tremendous 
amount of liability on the po-
lice department.
There are already safety 
mechanisms in guns — for 
example the “safety” — and 
smart guns often seem to be 
a complicated, ?ashy, and un-
necessary solution. If some-
one already doesn’t lock their 
guns at home, or keep their 
magazines separate from their 
weapons, or take any number 
of simple precautions, then 
adding something even more 
complex and expensive won’t 
help.
One Pugwash member 
wondered how far society has 
to go to protect people who 
seem to refuse to protect them-
selves. For example, if a pedes-
trian refuses to look both ways 
before crossing a street, do we 
need smarter cars, or do we 
need to teach people to look 
both ways? There are responsi-
ble gun owners, and they don’t 
need the safety features of the 
smart technology, but the irre-
sponsible owners aren’t going 
to use the smart guns anyway.
The sorts of smart technolo-
gy that are catching on among 
gun owners are those that 
don’t hinder the basic func-
tion of a ?rearm, but only add 
to it, such as advanced aiming 
systems, or the ability to adjust 
bullet velocity from lethal to 
merely very painful. When try-
ing to make guns safer, techies 
have to work together with gun 
owners and understand their 
reasoning behind owning a 
?rearm. Otherwise, solutions 
that might seem ideal, end up 
on the wayside, unhelpful, un-
trusted, and unadopted.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This ar-
ticle is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on smart guns.

Brain’s mistakes provide insight for human & machine learning
NAVIYA SINGLA
Staffwriter
Brain-machine interfaces 
are devices that allow their 
subjects to control exter-
nal devices using only their 
thoughts. Using these inter-
faces, a team of researchers 
at Carnegie Mellon has found 
that the brain makes mistakes 
because its conception of the 
world isn’t always an accurate 
depiction of how the world re-
ally works.
The project primarily 
focuses on the process of 
learning while using a brain-
machine interface. Learning 
can be de?ned as an organ-
ism becoming increasingly 
able to adapt to its environ-
ment. This type of learning 
is nondeclarative, meaning 
that it cannot be expressed in 
words. Nondeclarative infor-
mation can be skills or certain 
motor abilities, in contrast to 
declarative memory, which is 
comprised of facts and infor-
mation. Nondeclarative mem-
ory can easily be understood 
as “knowing how,” where de-
clarative memory is “knowing 
that.”
In this experiment, the 
brain-machine interface used 
data received from the activ-
ity of the primary motor cor-
tex — the area of the brain 
that controls the execution of 
movement — to drive cursors 
on a monitor. The project in-
volved looking at the move-
ments made by the subject, 
especially the mistakes that 
they made. 
Those movements 
required the subject’s brain 
to issue motor commands, 
which generated a pattern of 
neural activity that drove the 
cursor. The subject’s brain, in 
this way, was learning how 
to perform these tasks and 
perform them accurately. In 
this way, learning can also be 
de?ned as becoming increas-
ingly able to perform a task 
without making mistakes.
Researchers found that the 
observed patterns of neural 
activity match the subject’s 
expectation of the working of 
the brain-computer interface. 
In order to come across these 
results, they used techniques 
developed by Matt Golub, 
a postdoctoral fellow in the 
Department of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering, over 
the course of his thesis. 
“We were able to ?g-
ure that those neural activ-
ity patterns are appropriate 
to drive what the subject 
thought the brain-computer 
interface was,” Steve Chase, 
assistant professor in the 
Department of Biomedical 
Engineering and the Center 
for the Neural Basis of Cog-
nition, said. “It suggests that 
one of the limiting factors in 
brain-machine interfaces is 
the learning itself. 
To make the devices work 
better, should we record more 
neurons or is there a de?cit of 
learning that we need to get 
around?”
The brain-machine inter-
faces work by relating the 
neuron ?red to a particular 
direction. When recording 
neural activity, it can be ob-
served that neurons tend to 
be “directionally tuned”, e.g. 
they ?re more if the subject 
intends to “go” in a particular 
direction and less if they want 
to go in a different direction. 
When one looks at the ac-
tion potential (an electrical 
pulse that travels through the 
neuron to facilitate commu-
nication) ?red to go in a par-
ticular direction and plot the 
action potential as a function 
of direction that the neurons 
are ?ring in, one can observe 
a smooth curve. That curve 
has a peak, which is repre-
sentative of the neurons’ pre-
ferred direction. These devic-
es work to ?gure out the peak 
of these graphs and under-
stand that when a particular 
neuron ?res, the cursor has 
to be moved in that direction. 
As the subject receives visual 
feedback from her actions, 
she can get better at control-
ling the cursor. While there 
are some broad similarities 
across different subjects, the 
particular patterns of activity 
and the relationship between 
neurons differs signi?cantly 
from subject to subject. In 
fact, there is no way to cor-
relate neurons from one sub-
ject to another subject. The 
?rst step to building a brain-
computer interface, is ?nding 
the relationship between neu-
ral activity and cursor move-
ments, then creating a “map-
ping” of sorts and connecting 
that to the device. Based on 
the data received from the ex-
periment, the team conclud-
ed that the subjects would 
misinterpret the working of 
the interface and “expect” it 
to work a certain way. 
Their internal model in-
?uenced their learning pro-
cesses, as they continued to 
make fewer mistakes as time 
went on. This project has a 
myriad of applications; just 
like humans learn from our 
mistakes, we may soon be 
able to observe robots doing 
the same.  
Rather than having a robot 
intent of performing its duty 
and not realizing whether or 
not it’s performing it well, 
we may soon see robots who 
can better adapt and learn to 
better perform their tasks. 
“By understanding how to 
improve the brain-machine 
interface, we could imme-
diately apply this to telesur-
gery,” Chase said. A trained 
surgeon operating in a re-
mote location would have to 
have a very good model of 
the device to practice surgical 
maneuvers. 
One could study the mis-
matches between the internal 
models and the machine’s re-
sponse to train the surgeons 
to perform that action. 
“[The research team and I] 
want to understand the rela-
tionship between the training 
that we give and how quickly 
you would develop accurate 
internal models,” Chase said.

mindfulness meditation pro-
vides physical bene?ts along 
with the psychological ones. 
“Mindfulness meditation is 
about paying attention to 
your experience, and I think 
it helped these stressed out 
unemployed folks in our 
study by helping them notice 
how they were reacting to 
stresses,” Creswell said. “With 
mindfulness training, they 
could take a step back and 
begin to change ineffective 
reactivity patterns to more 
effective responses to life 
stressors.” So next time you’re 
feeling stressed, take a few 
minutes and focus on breath-
ing, on nothing else but the 
present. It’s easier said than 
done, but practicing mindful-
ness meditation may change 
your outlook on how to ap-
proach stressful situations.

time is a scienti?c achieve-
ment that wasn’t possible a 
few years ago as only a few 
neurons together would be 
monitored at once. 
“AI has gone from failure 
to failure with bits of prog-
ress,” Yann LeCun, director 
of the Center for Data Sci-
ence at New York University, 
said in a Carnegie Mellon 
press release. “This could be 
another leapfrog.” 
Using this massive data-
set, the researchers hope to 
unveil intricacies in neural 
nets. Their goal is to then 
apply their new knowledge to 
machine learning algorithms 
that would enable them to 
develop a model given a 
fewer number of examples. 
This holds great signi?-
cance for the future, since 
machine learning is a bur-
geoning research area within 
many lab communities. 
The idea being that if we 
can somehow understand 
the brain, we can under-
stand how to replicate it, and 
our machines will become 
capable of learning on their 
own. The dual goals of this 
research project are very in 
tune with Carnegie Mellon’s 
interdisciplinary culture. 
This research is made 
possible through funding 
from the Intelligence Ad-
vanced Research Projects 
Activity (IARPA) through 
its Machine Intelligence 
from Cortical Networks 
(MICrONS) research plan.

The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team traveled 
to the University of Chicago 
for a rematch on Friday. In a 
tough-fought battle that went 
into overtime, the Tartans 
emerged victorious with a 
93–90 score.
An early Tartan lead dis-
solved as Chicago mounted a 
comeback, prompting a series 
of lead changes throughout 
the rest of the game. Sopho-
more guard Anna Novak’s two 
foul shots gave the Tartans a 
42–40 lead at halftime, but 
the game continued to be a 
battle between the Tartans 
and the Maroons. Though 
the Tartans held onto the 
lead at the end of the third 
quarter, Chicago made a run 
that brought a 52–44 Tartan 
lead down to a 62–61 Carn-
egie Mellon advantage. Chi-
cago took a 70–69 lead in the 
fourth quarter and threatened 
to keep the Tartans down. 
With 6.1 seconds left and 
down 79–77, junior guard 
Jackie Hudepohl broke free 
and earned the tying basket 
with 1.5 seconds left. 
Senior guard Lindsay Poss 
made the ?rst shot for the 
Tartans, and they never re-
linquished the lead. Hude-
pohl led the team in scoring, 
amassing 23 points along 
with 11 rebounds for her ?fth 
double-double of the season. 
Poss contributed 21 points, 
junior center and forward Lisa 
Murphy gave 17, and senior 
forward Liza Otto added 10. 
First-year guard Jenn May-
berger became Carnegie Mel-
lon’s single season assist lead-
er. Her current total of 119 
eclipsed the mark of 117 set by 
Jeanine Megahan in 1992-93.
On Sunday, the Tartans lost 
to the No. 10 ranked Washing-
ton University in St. Louis by 
a score of 57–54. After a tight 
?rst quarter that the Bears led 
11–8, the Tartans started to 
pull away in the second and 
third quarters. Though they 
held a 14 point lead with 8:50 
left in the game, Washington 
University managed to mount 
a comeback. The Bears took 
advantage of the Tartans’ 28 
turnovers in the game, and 
overtook the Tartans as time 
ticked away.
 Down by one with 11 sec-
onds left in the game, Otto 
made the risky decision to 
foul against the Bears, put-
ting the Tartans behind by 
three but giving them one 
last chance with the ball. Poss 
tried her best on a three-point 
?eld goal, but the shot missed 
and ended the Tartans’ hopes.
Otto led the team in scor-
ing, making a career-high 25 
points for the Tartans. Mur-
phy and Hudepohl contrib-
uted 11 and 10 rebounds, re-
spectively.
The Tartans are now 16–6 
overall and 5–6 in the UAA. 
The Tartans will next face off 
against Emory University on 
Friday, Feb. 19.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team faced 
off against the University of 
Chicago for the second time 
this season. The Tartans fell to 
the Maroons 94–59.
Though the ?rst 17 min-
utes of play saw neither team 
gain a lead of more than three 
points, Chicago closed the half 
with 11 unanswered points, 
and the Tartans were never 
able to recover. Junior center 
Chris Shkil led the team with 
13 points and seven rebounds.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
took on Washington Univer-
sity in St. Louis, falling 80–75. 
After the Bears built a 15–10 
lead in the ?rst four minutes 
of play, the Tartans went on 
a 9–2 run, earning their only 
lead of the game. The Bears 
went on a run of their own, 
leading to a 44–35 advan-
tage for the home team. The 
Tartans fought to the very 
end, coming as close as 70–69 
with 2:03 to play before the 
Bears ?nished off the Tartans 
with ?ve consecutive points. 
Junior forward Jack Serbin 
became the 19th Tartan to 
reach 1,000 points in his ca-
reer. Serbin etched 21 points 
and 12 rebounds to record 
his 13th double-double of the 
season. Shkil had 21 points 
and nine rebounds.
The Tartans are now 9–13 
overall and 2–9 in the UAA. 
The Tartans will face Emory 
University at home on Friday, 
Feb. 19.

Losing the Super Bowl is 
never a good feeling, and be-
ing the immediate reason why 
your team lost the Super Bowl 
is even worse. For Carolina 
Panthers quarterback Cam 
Newton, the postgame press 
conference proved to be too 
much, especially with Broncos 
cornerback Chris Harris cel-
ebrating at his own conference 
right behind Newton. After 
three minutes giving mostly 
short answers to media ques-
tions, Newton abruptly left 
the press conference as Harris 
boasted how the Broncos shut 
down the Panthers’ offense. 
On Tuesday, Newton held a 
press conference that lasted 
over seven minutes, address-
ing his behavior after the Su-
per Bowl among other topics. 
“I’ve had a lot of time to think 
about it. I’ve seen so much 
blown out of proportion. At 
the end of the day when you 
invest so much time, when you 
sacri?ce so much and things 
don’t go as planned, I think 
emotions take over. I think 
that’s what happens,” Newton 
said.
To be fair to Newton, post-
game interviews never feel 
good after a loss, especially 
when it’s the Super Bowl. Pan-
thers head coach Ron Rivera 
was sympathetic to Newton. 
“What we’re asking people to 
do in a stressful situation af-
ter a very dif?cult situation is 
to gather our composure and 
step up right away,” Rivera 
said. “I’m not sure how fair 
that is. I’m really not. And he’s 
not the only player that’s ever 
been through a situation like 
that and handled it like that.” 
He had handled himself with 
composure after the game, 
and offered congratulations to 
the Broncos in a show of good 
sportsmanship. Broncos quar-
terback Peyton Manning spoke 
glowingly about Newton 
in a Monday interview on 
The Today Show. “He was very 
nice to me, and I really appre-
ciated that,” Manning said. 
“He’ll be back in that game, I 
can promise you. I’ve been on 
that side of it. It is tough, it is 
not an easy pill to swallow. But 
he was very nice to me and I 
really appreciated that.”
Still, Newton’s stoicism on 
the ?eld, which some have 
noted was more than Manning 
showed following his own loss 
in Super Bowl XLIV against the 
New Orleans Saints, does not 
excuse his actions at the press 
conference. Newton’s position 
as the face of the Carolina Pan-
thers demands that he sit there 
and take what the media gives 
him. Scott Fowler, a writer for 
The Charlotte Observer noted 
that Buffalo Bills kicker Scott 
Norwood had taken a full half 
hour of questioning after his 
missed ?eld goal gave the New 
York Giants a 20–19 victory 
over the Bills. “That’s the way 
a pro does it,” Fowler wrote. 
“No one wants to answer ques-
tions after you just lost the 
biggest game of your life, but 
that’s part of why you are paid 
millions to play a kids’ game.”
Hall of Fame cornerback 
Deion Sanders was not a fan 
of how Newton handled him-
self in the press conference. 
“You’re opening yourself for 
more criticism, because ev-
erybody is going to say you’re 
dabbing and smiling and 
smiling and styling,” Sanders 
said. “So this is how you go out 
when you lose?” Hall of Fame 
quarterback and ESPN analyst 
Steve Young had similar re-
marks about Newton. “ You’re 
the guy that’s going to be the 
face of the franchise, you’re 
the face of the NFL going for-
ward, you were the dabber,” 
Young said. “This is the mo-
ment to actually show that re-
silience on the other side.”
It’s not as if Newton is in-
capable of giving positive re-
sponses to the media after a 
loss. Following the 20–13 loss 
to the Atlanta Falcons on Dec. 
27 that ended their strong 
hopes of a perfect season, 
Newton gave stoic and com-
posed responses of how he was 
responsible for the loss, how 
his teammates played their 
hearts out, and how the Pan-
thers would continue to win. 
Though the scale of the Su-
per Bowl is much larger than 
one game against the Falcons, 
Newton still needs to compose 
himself with the patience ex-
pected from a quarterback 
who took his team from a los-
ing season the year before to 
the Super Bowl. Newton needs 
time to recover from the big-
gest defeat of his career. If he 
truly learns from the whole 
experience, he will come back 
next season in full force as the 
leader his team needs.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
tennis team took the court on 
Saturday to face off against 
the Saint Francis University 
Red Flash, an NCAA Division 
I opponent. The discrepancy 
in division might bring one to 
think that the Division III Tar-
tans took the fall in this seem-
ingly David vs. Goliath match-
up, but the Tartans ended up 
emerging victorious in a land-
slide 6–1 victory, improving 
their record to 4–1, and bump-
ing the Red Flash down to 5–2.
Carnegie Mellon com-
pletely dominated doubles 
play as the duo of seniors 
Yuvraj Kumar and Abhishek 
Alla were the ?rst to taste vic-
tory in third doubles, winning 
the ?rst slot 6–4. The ?rst-year 
tandem of Vayum Arora and 
Daniel Levine took control of 
first doubles to win 7–6 (7–2), 
while the Tartan’s third pair of 
sophomore Jeffrey Chen and 
junior Kenny Zheng won 6–3 
in second doubles. The Tartans 
moved into singles play feeling 
very con?dent that they could 
continue the sweep.
Levine was the ?rst to ?n-
ish singles play, and took 
the set 6–1, 7–5 in the sec-
ond position to maintain the 
Tartans’ healthy lead over the 
Red Flash. Junior Kunal Wad-
wani won in ?fth singles with 
a 6–1, 7–6 (7–5) score to bring 
the Tartans to a strong 3–0 ad-
vantage. Zheng clinched the 
match in third singles with 
a hard-fought 6–4, 5–7, 7–6 
(7–3) victory. Arora took the 
victory in fourth singles with 
a score of 6–4, 5–7, 6–3, and 
sophomore Tommy Cheng 
won in sixth singles, 6–2, 6–3.
This dominating perfor-
mance against a team placed 
two divisions higher than the 
Tartans shows that the men’s 
tennis team is a real contender 
for national ranking, and they 
are going to continue to im-
prove on their current No. 11 
rank through consistent hard 
work and practice.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
suffered a tough loss to Divi-
sion I opponent Youngstown 
State, 4–3. Their next compe-
tition will be against Pomona-
Pitzer at Case Western Re-
serve University in Cleveland, 
Ohio on Friday, Feb. 19 as they 
look to come back from this 
week’s loss.
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s tennis team improved 
its record to a perfect 6–0 on 
Saturday in a match against 
NCAA Division I opponent 
Saint Francis University. The 
Tartans emerged victorious 
with a score line of 5–2, earn-
ing the doubles point and then 
going on to win the ?rst four 
singles match in a show of in-
credible athletic prowess.
First-year Minami Makino 
and sophomore Cori Sidell 
worked together in ?rst dou-
bled to take the victory 6–1, 
while junior Nicholle Torres 
and senior Abbey Hamstra 
similarly dominated their 
match in third doubles with a 
score of 6–2.
The ?rst to ?nish singles 
play for the Tartans was Sidell, 
who took the match in the sec-
ond slot by a core of 6–4, 6–2. 
Torres followed her to win by 
the same score, improving 
the team’s lead to 3–0. Senior 
Brooke Tsu took the match 
point at ?rst singles in a nail-
biting come from behind win 
in the third set, winning with 
a score of 6-2, 3–6, 6–4.
The next challenge for the 
Tartans comes on Friday, Feb. 
19, as they take on another Di-
vision I opponent, Duquesne 
University. The Tartans will 
look to continue to improve 
their rank against Duquesne 
before playing in the ITA Di-
vision III National Indoor 
Championship the following 
week. If the Tartans keep this 
up, they’re on track to run 
the gauntlet and become a 
force to be reckoned with on a 
national level.
Zika virus raising concerns for 2016 Olympics in Brazil
JORDAN SAFER
Staffwriter
The fallout of the Zika virus 
as Brazil hosts the 2016 Sum-
mer Olympics depends on a lot 
of factors, but based on historic 
results, there a few ways Olym-
pic crises usually work them-
selves out. Of course, this all 
depends on what scale the Zika 
virus continues to spread, and 
how severe its impact turns out 
to be. 
According to the Center for 
Disease Control (CDC), com-
mon symptoms of the virus are 
a fever, rashes, joint pain, and 
conjunctivitis. While a com-
bination of these symptoms 
sounds unpleasant, the ail-
ments are hardly deadly.
The real issues stem from 
how easily Zika spreads unde-
tected, and whether or not it 
causes birth defects. It seems 
more and more likely that 
women who get Zika while 
pregnant are likely to have chil-
dren with birth defects, most 
notably a brain defect called 
microcephaly, which can cause 
lifelong problems for the in-
fants, and frequently results in 
death.
Brazil, the most heavily im-
pacted country, has reported 
over 4,000 cases of microceph-
aly with potential ties to Zika. 
While the link between Zika 
and microcephaly hasn’t been 
con?rmed, the jump in cases in 
countries with the virus points 
to a connection.
So what will Brazil do? In 
the past, there has been a gen-
eral ‘the show must go on’ men-
tality with the Olympic games. 
With the exception of the 1916, 
1940, and 1944 games, which 
were cancelled because of the 
World Wars, every games has 
been run as planned indepen-
dent of external forces.
So if the show goes on, how 
will it go? Looking back to 
the cost overruns of the 2014 
World Cup hosted by Brazil 
(FIFA admits a cost of upwards 
of 15 billion USD), there is al-
ready cause for concern. Even 
without the complications of a 
birth defect causing virus, cost 
overruns have been a consis-
tent problem for ?rst time hosts 
of the Olympics, with the Sochi 
games having an estimated 
cost upward of 50 billion USD.
While cost overruns and 
runaway price tags are cer-
tainly an issue, the games have 
always run as planned through 
?nancial issues. With steep 
costs at the Beijing Olympics 
in 2008 and at the Montreal 
Olympics in 1976, events ran 
as planned and only after were 
the hosts left trying to recoup 
their losses.
Besides high costs, the de-
fault problem for an Olympic 
games is boycotting countries. 
Past historic boycotts have 
come from border disputes, 
apartheid protests, Cold War 
political statements, and even 
smaller regional disputes. 
While the last boycott was by 
North Korea in 1988, this op-
tion has often been taken ad-
vantage of, with seven boycotts 
held in the last 16 games.
This leaves the question of 
what it would take for the Zika 
virus to cause any form of boy-
cott. To date, there are about 
35,000 estimated cases of the 
virus in Brazil, many of which 
are not con?rmed. In contrast, 
the CDC estimates that there 
were 60.8 million cases of the 
H1N1 ?u virus in the United 
States during the 2009-2010 
outbreak. For Brazil to have a 
proportionally large outbreak, 
there would need to be about 
40 million cases of the Zika vi-
rus. However, if the correlation 
between the Zika virus and 
birth defects is con?rmed, the 
picture would be different for 
the Zika virus. But which coun-
tries would boycott the games?
Since Zika is very dif?cult 
to contain in areas with mos-
quito populations and subpar 
medical systems, African and 
Southeast Asian countries 
where the disease could quick-
ly spread have reason to con-
sider caution. The island coun-
tries around the South China 
Sea are especially vulnerable, 
given past problems in these 
areas containing yellow fever, 
a disease spread by the same 
mosquito breed as Zika.
In addition to facing the 
prospect of intercontinental 
boycotts, Brazil may see coun-
tries close to home choose 
not participate. El Salvador, a 
small country south of Guate-
mala in central America, has 
asked its population to avoid 
having children until progress 
is made battling Zika. Could 
they go the next step, and ask 
people not to go to Brazil?
Even if a country isn’t wor-
ried about bringing Zika back 
from Brazil, they may prefer to 
keep the focus on combating 
the disease, instead of turning 
to the Olympic games. Take 
Columbia, which estimates 
30,000 cases of its own. While 
an of?cial boycott of the Olym-
pic games may not be neces-
sary, another Zika-hit coun-
try could easily choose not to 
participate in order to focus 
national efforts on the problem 
at hand.
With Zika becoming a big-
ger issue each day in Latin 
America, there are still a lot 
of options on the table for the 
2016 Summer Olympics. But 
odds are good that most coun-
tries will still participate as 
planned.

Monologues will be performed at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. 
on Feb. 15, in the Cohon Center’s Peter/Wright/
McKenna rooms. Tickets are $5 and all proceeds 
will be donated to New Voices Pittsburgh, a 
charity representing the rights and health of local 
women of color.
The Vagina Monologues, rather than being a 
typical piece of illusory theater, sets out to create a 
conversation between its actors and the audience 
about the female experience. In line with this goal, 
MORF’s production will take place in the close-
knit space of Peter/Wright/McKenna as opposed 
to the distanced McConomy and audience 
members will be seated in a semi-circle. Rather 
than passive entertainment and a traditional story 
arc, The Vagina Monologues is much more about 
engagement with the themes of each stand-alone 
narrative.
Premiering in 1996, The Vagina Monologues has 
garnered a reputation as both a feminist statement 
and a celebrated piece of theater. The play is 
structured around a series of one-off scenes, 
some of which are individual monologues and 
others are in groups, all concerning the female 
experience. Ensler interviewed over 200 women to 
collect material for the episodes. The monologues 
cover a range of topics stemming from the trans 
experience and survivors of rape to concerns over 
pubic hair.
Zucker, who also sits on the MORF executive 
board, says that while the play is focused on 
women, one hardly needs a vagina to enjoy it. 
“Even though it’s typically branded as a feminist 
piece of theater, it’s really more universal than 
that. It’s not really about the vagina, but about 
women’s experiences and how women are defined 
by their bodies, and that takes on different forms 
throughout the piece... you don’t need to be a 
woman or identify as a feminist to learn something 
from it, and it’s a really interesting piece of theater 
no matter where you’re coming from,” she said.
The 21-person cast is an eclectic mix of ages, 
backgrounds, and acting experience. Rather than 
source from a single pool — such as Scotch’n’Soda 
— MORF wanted to ensure that they had a 
diverse cast, so they put out a general casting call 
throughout campus as well as approached like-
minded organizations such as ALLIES. The result 
is a cast of players committed to the project itself 
and its ideas.
While it may seem coincidence that this 
production is occurring around Valentine’s Day, 
it’s actually quite a common date for productions 
of The Vagina Monologues. The reason for this 
is that Ensler doesn’t require that community 
productions of her play pay for the rights during 
the month of February as part of the V-Day 
Movement, a global effort to end violence against 
women inspired by The Vagina Monologues. An 
additional requirement of the deal is that the 
production benefit a women’s charity, which is 
why MORF will be donating all proceeds to New 
Voices Pittsburgh. According to their website, 
New Voices “promotes the compete health and 
well-being of Black women and girls in the Greater 
Pittsburgh Region [and] amplifies the voices 
of Black women and girls to advance Sexual & 
Reproductive Health, LGBTQ Rights, Health Care 
Access, Ending Gender-Based Violence, Ending 
Mass Incarceration, and Environmental Justice.”

Advice for Awkward People
Hey Joshua!
I’ve got a little bit of a 
medical issue, and I’m 
not quite sure where to 
turn. I’ve talked to Health 
Services and even CaPS, 
but nobody can really 
understand me like you, 
you beautiful, faceless 
man.
I’ve got a recurring 
sickness issue. It’s 
nothing life-threatening 
or anything, but it’s like 
super annoying. I’ve had 
a cold for like seventeen 
years now, and every 
time I get better, one of 
my friends or relatives or 
coworkers or a random 
woman on the subway 
and her snot-nosed 
children will get me sick 
again. I don’t know if I 
just have a weak immune 
system or I’m cursed by 
the Dark Lord Himself, 
but I feel like I’m getting 
really old really fast. 
Since I can’t get any 
help from medical 
professionals, I’ve 
decided to sequester 
myself and become a 
monk in the Himalayas 
where I’ll never have to 
deal with sick people 
again, and I can live a 
long, happy life while 
trying to find inner peace, 
nothingness, death, a 
plant to take care of, or 
whatever monks like to 
find. Do you think that’s a 
good idea? I’d love your 
opinion, O’ wise one.

Dear MONK-Y BUSINESS,
That doesn’t sound healthy 
at all! The first thing to do 
is make sure that you’re 
eating and sleeping and 
hydrating enough so your 
body is healthy and strong. 
Then, you can start really 
considering why your 
immune system seems to 
be so weak. It’s a very valid 
concern, but becoming a 
monk and running away 
from the world of modern 
medicine isn’t quite the 
solution I would have hoped 
you’d turn to. I suggest really 
taking an inventory of your 
own habits and making sure 
that you have all your bases 
covered in terms of your own 
health. If all else fails, drink 
some orange juice!
Peace, Love, and Puppy 
Dog Tails,
Joshua Brown

Last Friday and Saturday, Scotch’n’Soda’s production of 
The Outsiders played at McConomy Auditorium in the 
Cohon Center. Based on a book by classic American author 
S.E. Hinton, the story explores themes of gang violence, 
youth, and social status.
The protagonist is the young Ponyboy growing up in 
the streets of 1960s Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is a member of 
the Greasers, one of two gangs in the area; the “Socs,” 
or Socials, are their rivals. The Socials are better off than 
the Greasers, and Ponyboy laments the condition of his 
friends compared to the Socs. His opinion changes after 
he meets a friendly Soc, Cherry Valence, the girlfriend of 
Bob Sheldon. Sheldon is a Soc who has previously jumped 
Ponyboy and his friend Johnny. The action is set in motion 
when Johnny kills Sheldon when he tries to drown Ponyboy 
in a confrontation. Dallas, another Greaser, gives Ponyboy 
and Johnny money and instructs them to ?ee the city. 
The rest of the story centers on the perils and heartbreak 
Ponyboy faces following this life changing moment.
The Scotch’n’Soda production is different from the original 
in several notable ways. The directors have “reimagined 
the 1960s as a place where one’s gender, sexuality and race 
are not aspects that hold one back.” The directors note that 
although the story has many universal themes, the cast is 
very heterogenous. There are more people than “straight 
white boys” who felt pain while growing up. The cast was 
is diverse, with every group playing a signi?cant role.
Two of the leading characters are played by women, rather 
than the men in the original; ?rst-year humanities major 
Anna Beck is cast as Ponyboy and junior music major Bryn 
Scharenberg is cast as Johnny. Senior humanities and arts 
major Sam Riordan takes the role of Dallas, now a lesbian 
who is attracted to Cherry Valence. Sodapop, who in the 
story is Ponyboy’s protective older brother, is played by 
Sophomore electrical and computer engineering major 
Russell Hawkins, an African American; all the while Beck, 
who plays Ponyboy, is Caucasian. This is made light of in 
one of the scenes when Cherry comments that she should 
have known that the two were siblings because they “look 
alike,” which prompted laughter from the audience.
The set consists of a platform on the left hand side that 
depicts a drawing room, presumably in Ponyboy’s house. 
This is the focal point of the play. To the right end of the 
stage, there is a wall with graf?ti and a chain-link fence, 
which indicates the concrete jungle outdoors. The props 
work well with the story, even though they are fairly 
standard. One creative prop used is the fountain in which 
Ponyboy is nearly drowned by Bob. The fountain, which 
was rolled out onto stage, had a basin ?lled with water 
and a functional spout. While the set does not change 
drastically over the course of the play, the lighting and 
sound effects serve to transport the audience to each one of 
the scenes, from a burning building to a hospital room.
The execution of the play is impeccable; all of the actors are 
beyond professional and well rehearsed. I can imagine that 
the props crew is especially meticulous in not dropping 
any parts on stage during the production, and the lighting 
is very good at casting a spotlight or obscuring parts of 
the stage. The vocal performance was loud, clear, and 
consistent. The movements of the actors are well timed 
and coordinated, and the overall ?ow from one scene to the 
other was consistent.
The story focuses on the theme of coming of age. An 
emphasis is placed on the importance of shaping the 
future, as Ponyboy’s brothers encourage him to stay in 
school and get good grades. Ponyboy and his gang are 
met with the reality of an unfair and class-based society, 
and the feeling that they are not treated the same because 
of their social status. In the middle of his ordeal, Ponyboy 
learns not to think of his relationship with the Socs as “us 
versus them” when he eventually gets to know Cherry and 
the other sons.
The audience had an overall positive reaction to the 
play. Many of the scenes were met with laughter, cheers, 
and applause. The more serious scenes were quiet and 
somber. First-year Shubhangi Bhotika said that the play 
was “extremely relevant, making me think more deeply 
about politics, and societal structures in general.” First-year 
Sanjna Bhartiya called the play “emotional, entertaining, 
and really well done.”

Eastend Mile brings back the Jazz at Cattivo
The seasoned quartet performs a mix of originals and covers with charisma and swagger
Sometimes I feel like there is just so much happening 
at and around Carnegie Mellon, featuring our students 
and alumni, that it is impossible to actually soak it all 
in. If we wanted to have the fullest college experience 
possible, doing and seeing all of the coolest stuff, we 
would probably have to stop going to class and doing 
our homework. But we can’t so we prioritize what we 
like and what we can afford, letting so much fall by 
the wayside. For me, Eastend Mile was one of those 
things.
I’ve heard of the band. Two of its members are current 
students, and one is an alumni. I’ve been invited 
to their shows on Facebook quite a few times, but, 
because there are only so many hours in the day, I 
usually ignore the invite (sorry, guys!). But let me 
tell you here and now: Go see these guys. Make it a 
priority to see an Eastend Mile show.
I have to admit, reading “contemporary jazz sound for 
a new generation” on their website did sort of concern 
me. It gave me ?ashbacks to the hours I’ve spent 
trapped in the car with my dad listening to NPR. I’ve 
always found jazz, or at least my dad’s jazz, to be so 
irritatingly dissonant. Perhaps I’ve been ruined by Top 
40, or I’m not as intelligent of a music-consumer as he 
would have liked, but something about jazz has just 
always gotten under my skin. What really bothers me 
is that there are upwards of six instruments that don’t 
always feel like they’re working towards the same 
goal. It’s like One Direction, several units all going 
different directions, not really on the same page.
But what was great about Eastend Mile, and what has 
made me a contemporary jazz convert, is that we have 
all classic jazzy instruments — saxophone, keyboards, 
bass, and drums — but they’re all on the same team 
here. The instrumentalists were all working toward 
the same goal, and that goal was making me dance.
Holding down the beat on drums was junior ethics, 
history, and public policy and professional writing 
double major Dhruva Krishna. To his right was the 
unsung hero and groove keeper, senior mathematical 
sciences major Christoffer Thygesen, or Tiggy. When 
the band originally formed back in 2013, these two 
hadn’t joined yet. Eastend Mile consisted only of Caleb 
Lombardi and Roger Romero (COE ‘14). With Lombardi 
on the keys and Romero on the saxophone, the duo 
recorded their debut album City Limits, shortly after 
adding in the beat and groove characteristic of good 
jazz music.
Because there was no vocalist to hide behind, you 
really got to hear and appreciate the skill of these four 
musicians. As someone who cannot keep an actual 
beat, I’ve always just been impressed by middle 
school snare drum players. Krishna and Thygesen 
really did more than keep a beat for the group; they 
weren’t playing back-up, which I feel tends to happen 
to rhythm instruments. The drums and bass really 
did carry as much musical weight as the keys or 
saxophone. I was very impressed by their presence 
within the band dynamic on stage.
And since they don’t have a lead vocalist, Romero and 
Lombardi split the duty. Lombardi took over the emcee 
duties, communicating with the audience, introducing 
songs, and giving shout-outs to the other musicians. I 
must admit, he and his tiny man-bun really were quite 
charming. But charm isn’t all you expect from the lead 
of your favorite band — there has to be some kind of 
swoon-factor. Enter Roger Romero. I can’t remember 
him saying anything, but he didn’t have to. All he had 
to do was ?nger out a melody and we as the audience 
knew we were under his loving care. Not only is 
Romero a technically skilled musician, he is basically 
a modern crooner. During the song “I’m the Realest” 
Romero descended into the crowd, playing as he 
walked, and stopping to make some very intense eye 
contact with women along the way. Not to brag, but I 
got a slice of this.
What was also really fun about their set was how 
they used covers. It’s smart to acknowledge that not 
everyone in the crowd will know original songs, but 
they will know, and get down to, dance jams like The 
Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My Face” and a mashup of Justin 
Bieber’s “What Do You Mean” and “Sorry.” Not only 
did I have a great time dancing to these, I felt like it 
also showed the group’s sense of humor. While some 
consider these songs pop trash, Eastend Mile saw a 
good beat and an opportunity to please crowds. And 
Romero did these tunes great justice, ?ring out the 
recognizable melodies.
While Eastend Mile does deserve a lot of credit for a 
great show, I must tip my hat as well to openers, Sea 
Rights and Wreck Loose, both local groups, as well as 
booking group Found Sound Music, founded by another 
Carnegie Mellon alumni and former Tartan staffwriter, 
Kyle Henson (TSB ‘14). Henson pulled together a great 
crew and picked a great venue. I highly recommend 
Cattivo’s beef and cheese fries and four dollar whiskey 
sours, which both warmed me up on a chilly night.
As much as I was dreading bearing the elements on 
Friday night to trek to Lawrenceville, the night was all-
around worth the 4.9x Uber surge pricing.

I have always dreamt that one day I would have a 
local eatery where I would be able to greet the staff 
with an air of familiarity. I hoped to know the menu 
by heart and to be in a position where I could make 
recommendations with a sense of experience to back 
me up. I still haven’t reached the epitome of this 
aspiration, but if I had to pick a place that brings 
me the closest to it, that place would be Crepes 
Parisiennes.
During orientation 2014, like many freshmen, I found 
myself strolling along the lengths of South Craig Street 
day in and day out. Given its proximity to campus, 
I felt a need to familiarize myself with the various 
establishments positioned along the road, and before 
long I started planning out which restaurants to eat at 
on those weekends when I ran out of blocks. Crepes 
Parisiennes stood out to me mostly because I walked 
down to Craig from Fifth Avenue more often than not, 
and because of its simple facade with charming black 
tables positioned outside and a large glass window up 
front allowing passersby a glance within.
My roommate and I quickly set a date to try the place 
out, and it has since become our favorite brunch place, 
so, as you can imagine, I’ve tried my fair share of their 
dishes. Here are some that I ?nd myself going back for:
Crepes:
The Smoked Icelandic Salmon: This is the ?rst crepe 
I ever had there and it will always be my favorite. 
Perhaps it was the sense of entitlement I felt when 
asking for “Icelandic Salmon” (which I assume is 
superior to your everyday salmon) that lured me to this 
menu item, or perhaps the intrigue that arose with 
putting salmon in a crepe. Either way, I’ve never looked 
back. The crepe comes topped with creme fraiche and 
a salmon and chives ?lling. What’s beautiful about this 
crepe is the delicate nature of the crepe itself, and the 
simplicity of the dish as a whole. Like every crepe, the 
Smoked Icelandic Salmon crepe comes with a light 
salad (with some lovely mandarin orange wedges and 
a light garlic-infused olive oil dressing), and not much 
more. Because the ?lling is kept so simple, the strong 
?avor of the salmon really speaks for itself without 
being overwhelmed by accessory elements. It’s a 
classic.
The Breakfast Crepe: with sausage, egg, and cheese 
tastes just like it sounds. It’s a match made in heaven 
and is very ?lling, making it great for the meal its name 
alludes to. The ?avor of the cheese was just sharp 
enough not to challenge the spice of the sausage, and 
the egg brings a nice volume to the dish.
The Mushroom and Cheese Crepe: is a great 
vegetarian option. It’s a classic savory crepe that stays 
true to the quality that the restaurant promises. Don’t 
be fooled by the name. Yes, it’s a very simple dish, but 
it’s a very simple dish done well.
On Sweet Crepes: I like to go with simple ones, just 
because a whole plate of sugar really overwhelms 
my palette. The White Forest Crepe with raspberries 
is light and comprised of well-balanced ?avors. The 
intensity of the sweetness from the white chocolate 
?lling is already brought down by the crepe itself, and 
the raspberries provide a nice level of acidity that 
cleanses the palette in between bites. I love this with 
walnuts and the fresh whipped cream that Crepes 
Parisiennes has to offer with their sweet crepes, and 
highly appreciate the fresh berries, and other berry 
items on the menu, that come with each dish. It’s nice 
to get a break from the canned berries doused in syrup 
that I’ve come in contact with around campus and at 
fast food establishments.
Some Non-Crepes:
Tuna, Olive Tapenade, and Tomato Panini: Crepes 
Parisiennes has four paninis on their menu, but this one 
is by far my favorite, mostly because of the complexity 
of the ?avor interaction between the tuna and the olive 
tapenade. All in all, the panini has a rich Mediterranean 
feel to it, which I really appreciated.
Belgian Liege Waf?es: The waf?es here are unlike 
your typical waf?es. The waf?es themselves taste fresh, 
not just in terms of how warm and soft they are, but 
in terms of the batter used to make them. Instead of 
your typical blended-brand-frozen waf?e ?avor, I found 
that I could really taste the different components that 
went into the batter and feel the synergy that resulted 
from tasting all of them at once. It was a unique and 
rather enlightening experience. There are a few options 
to choose from, but I stay true to my love for white 
chocolate, so that’s the only one I’ve tried and tested.
Tea Babble:
Tea is one of my favorite things on this planet, and 
Crepes Parisiennes really helped me embrace my 
inner tea enthusiast. The restaurant offers a selection 
Le Melon: Crepes Parisiennes is warm and inviting

of 23 Mariage Fréres tea ?avors, all of which I have 
had the pleasure to enjoy — during separate sittings, 
of course. There are ?ve types of tea available, so 
I’ll go ahead and state my favorites and those that I 
thought stood out for each category:
Black Tea:  Favorite: Ceylon — Orange Pekoe. Stand 
out: Emperor Chen-Nung — Smoky Blend. This last 
one is the most interesting tea that I’ve tried from 
those available at Crepes Parisiennes. The taste is 
as the name suggests: SMOKY, which is hard to 
describe. You really need to taste this to appreciate it.
Green Tea: Favorite: Casablanca. Stand out: Thé Sur 
le nil — perfumed with fruits. The accents of fruit play 
in this are lovely; it’s a really unique ?avor for a green 
tea.
White Tea: There’s only one White Tea, the Blanc 
and Rose, and it’s very light and great for people who 
like the scent of tea, but not necessarily the intensity. 
Great with sweet or savory crepes. It’s lovely. The 
word lovely is lovely. Tea is lovely. Lovely.
Red Tea: Favorite: Rouge Bourbon. This is my favorite 
tea from this restaurant. Red tea has a beautiful rich 
?avor and aroma about it that goes perfectly with very 
meal I’ve had at Crepes Parisiennes. They also have a 
christmas version of this tea called “Noel” which has 
some classic holiday spices mixed in, and it’s divine.
 
Herbal Tea: Favorite: The Chamomille is organic, 
and my go-to calming tea. Stand out: The Dream Tea 
is a layered Herbal tea in terms of ?avor. The ?avor is 
unusual, but pleasant.
Heads Up:
Cha-ching: Until recently, Crepes Parisiennes only 
took cash, but now they take cards and that has made 
the lives of so many people better. You pay at the 
counter before you get your food and your order is 
served at your table.
Herbivores, Omnivores and Carnivores: This 
place is vegetarian friendly, carnivore friendly, and 
had lots of options on both ends of the spectrum. 
Because everything is made fresh, if you ask for a little 
modi?cation with your order, the staff is usually happy 
to do it for you, so don’t be afraid to ask.
Are we there yet?: It’s right on South Craig Street, 
walking distance from campus. Take any of the 
inbound buses running down Fifth or Forbes if you’re 
near campus.
Click, click: Currently, there is no of?cial website, 
but there are Yelp and Zomato pages that have been 
set up with reviews, critiques, menu items, and other 
information. Here they are:

https://www.zomato.com/pittsburgh/crepes-
parisiennes-pittsburgh
For those stay-at-home days: There is no home 
delivery option, but the restaurant does offer take out.
Hours: Closed on Mondays
Tuesday to Friday: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Closed on major holidays
21+: Crepes Parisiennes now offers a range of hard 
ciders that you can pick up for a meal or to go.
Rash Alert: Gluten, nuts, dairy, eggs, are the things I 
can think of off the top of my head. There are of course 
walnut-free options for the sweet crepes, and you can 
ask for some without creme fraiche or whipped cream. 
The staff is very accommodating, so be sure to ask 
when substitutes are available and to make sure what 
you’re order is clear of any allergic triggers.
Ambience: In a word: warm. The interior boasts some 
lovely aesthetic pieces such as brick walls, framed 
vintage photographs, some magazines, and a small 
eiffel tower by the windowsill. There are high tables 
and low tables, and the staff makes sure that tables 
are available for customers before they take their 
order. The kitchen is sectioned off from the rest of the 
restaurant by a thick counter with glass panes lining 
the top, so you can see into the kitchen and observe 
how they make the crepes.
College student friendly?: Of course, but I’ve seen 
pretty much every age group seated here at some time 
or another, so it’s a nice mixed bag of customers.
Shoutout: I’d like to insert a quick shout out to David, 
one of the wonderful people that works at Crepes 
Parisienne and makes this restaurant what it is. David 
has seen me maneuver my way through the list of 
teas, and made some of the most delicious crepes 
I’ve ever tasted. He’s the familiar face that I see every 
time I stop by and he’s always kind enough to give me 
a quick wave and ask me about my day. Thank you 
David for being so warm over the past two years, and 
to anyone who gets the chance to see him, tell him I 
said hey.
Overall rating:
The Smoked Icelandic Salmon crepe with Creme Fraiche and a light sweet and savory salad — a longtime classic.

This past Friday, Feb. 13, Carnegie Mellon’s annual 
Lunar Gala was held in Wiegand Gymnasium. This year 
was the show’s 20th anniversary, so the hype was pretty 
grand. With separate teams for producing, modeling, 
designing, dancing, tech, and others, this event really 
showcases the incredible passion of Carnegie Mellon 
students who have spent much of last semester and 
January preparing for it. But I know that’s not why you’re 
reading this article. So without further adieu, let’s review 
the good, the bad, and the downright strange looks that 
graced LG’s 20th anniversary stage.
The ?rst line, Polymorphism, by senior architecture major 
Richard Chou and junior art major Katherine Zhao, was 
described by the viewer’s pamphlet as a collection of 
pieces that represent “a structural form of data.” This 
collection featured a good amount of leather, blacks, 
grays, and metallics alongside hard, metal accents such 
as a giant, jauntily angled wire cube surrounding one 
of the models’ heads, and two wing-like forearm wraps, 
which seemed to hold the model’s arms in place. In all, 
this was a very solid collection. The geometries were 
unexpected and intricate, and the overall effect was 
interesting to watch.
Next, we had Cymatics by ?rst-year design major 
Anna Gusman and ?rst-year art major Ariana Nathani. 
Described as “an exploration of the way sound interacts 
with its environment on a molecular level,” Cymatics 
displayed quite an intriguing set of patterned pieces. My 
personal favorite was the ?rst look — an overlarge, short-
sleeved top whose entire front was cut into a gorgeously 
intricate and ?uid pattern that struck the right balance 
between sexy and tasteful. The only glaring negative I 
saw in this collection were the clear plastic visors some 
models wore over their faces; they looked a bit like 
cut-up Coke bottles to me.
Up next was The Barracks by junior industrial design 
major Linny Tan. Tan’s line was described as “a series 
of military-style lingerie that investigates the clash of 
hyper masculine and feminine in a quest for androgyny.” 
This collection played a lot with hints of color, using 
a primarily black base fabric and adding accents of a 
not-quite-?oral pattern. There were many interesting 
pieces here, particularly a mesh top with a folded lapel-
like chest covering which looked very luxurious. Also, 
many of the bottom pieces were beautifully executed. 
Most times with ?tted undergarments, they can end up 
looking bunchy or awkward, but these ?t each model’s 
curves perfectly. This collection was an overall success.
Moving on, we had Dauntless by junior chemistry 
major Eunice Oh, and senior electrical and computer 
engineering majors Katherine Wang and Yiru Yao. This 
collection “incorporate[d] elements which highlight the 
elegance of a woman and the ?erce nature of a warrior.” 
Dauntless featured a primarily black base garment 
embellished with some large, structured, gold armor 
pieces. This collection seemed to be an immediate 
crowd favorite, with the ?rst look — a ?tted leather 
and fabric cocktail dress with gold, wing-like shoulder 
pads — earning several hoots and hollers. Overall, this 
collection had a toe in dynastic style, with bright reds, 
golds, and blacks, and a toe in Alice and Wonderland, 
with the rose accents and the regality of many of the 
pieces.
Next was Abraxas by junior mechanical engineering 
major Melissa Zucker, junior humanities and arts major 
Catherine Zheng, and senior architecture major Shanna 
Chan. Described as “an exploration of the classic female 
silhouette through abstract mathematical concepts,” 
Abraxas had a few striking pieces — namely the cut-up 
black leather dress with huge shoulders and a slight 
accentuation of the hips, which looked like something 
straight out of this world. Overall, this collection was a 
nice sight.
Imperatrice, by sophomore business major Angela 
Liang, ?rst-year design major Shannon Lin, and ?rst-year 
humanities and arts major Hilary Lai, was inspired by 
Wu Zetian, “the only woman ever to rule China.” This 
collection played with cute, girly silhouettes, but each 
piece had a little bit of an edge to it. My favorite of the 
harder accents were the pyramid accents, placed on 
the models’ tops in the center of their chests. It was 
just enough point to say “I’m coming for you,” but not 
enough for you to be super nervous about that fact.
Next was Filigree by junior neuroscience major Noa 
Fineout. Fineout’s collection was a journey for me. At 
?rst, I absolutely hated all six of the garments. But when 
Fineout herself came out to receive her ?owers, she was 
wearing a piece as well, and it all kind of made sense. 
What I hated about the collection was that it seemed 
very un?nished and sloppy, but when Fineout came out, 
with her unsewn sleeves and busting seams, I ?gured 
that it was all part of the concept — a deconstruction of 
these multi-layered, Victorian undergarments. I believe 
that Fineout’s own garment was the highlight of her 
collection.
Lunar Gala 2016 is absolutely stunning
For its 20th anniversary, Carnegie Mellon’s fashion extravaganza pulls out all the stops
Exuviae, a line built around the idea of exoskeletons, 
featured beautifully crafted plastic accessories, which 
made the relatively simply blue pieces come alive.

Up next, we had XOAIX, pronounced just like it looks, by 
senior drama major Becki Liu. This collection, described 
as a “daydream inspired by the romantic colors of the 
south of France,” had its good points and its not-so-good 
points. With the exception of the very ?rst garment — a 
short dress with a lace neck accent — many of the pieces 
just didn’t do it for me. They hung a little strangely and 
didn’t ?atter the models’ ?gures enough to look good, but 
didn’t break away enough to look very conceptual. This 
was a miss, in my opinion.
One of the most exciting and innovative lines was Pom 
by sophomore design majors Emily Mongilio and Lily 
Fulop. This collection was all “crochet lingerie.” I’ll let 
that sink in. Blending the “soft, and fun” aspects of yarn 
work with the “risque and provocative,” Pom was one of 
the standout collections and took the idea of hooking to 
a whole new level. This was one of the few collections 
where the models actually had some fun. Adorned in a 
rain of pom-pom puffs, two of the models spun around 
their poms, and this brought a slightly sexy aspect to 
this already out-there line. Plus, the ?ts on these bottoms 
were impressive; as a crocheter myself, I was super 
impressed with how well the booties were cradled. It was 
one of the night’s highlight lines.
Next was Decay by ?rst-year drama major Michelle 
Li. In her description, Li characterizes her collection 
through the phases of decay the moon experiences. Her 
collection was earthy and exciting — the ?rst piece was 
accompanied by antlers. It was a very cool collection, 
incorporating a lot of late-fall colors and a bomb 
soundtrack. There were many notable pieces, but the 
one that I remember best was a huge, ?uffy, folded leaf-
looking garment which looked at once soft and brittle. 
Li’s was a very interesting concept, which was executed 
?awlessly.
Crest, by senior industrial design major Sophie Parrinello, 
was described as “free-spirited and easy going.” I think 
that’s a pretty apt description. The fabrics incorporated 
“traditional Japanese shibori indigo dy[e]ing” techniques, 
which resulted in a very interesting set of fabrics, which 
was used all throughout the line. This was the most 
cohesive line in terms of fabric choices — the indigo 
fabric and yellow undertones made up each garment — 
and I’m not sure if that was detrimental or bene?cial to 
this collection as a whole.
Up next was Corpus by junior design major Rachel 
Chang and junior science and arts major Christine Shen, 
described as an exploration of “the con?ict between 
vulnerability and protection in human relationships.” 
Personally, this was one of my least favorite lines. It tried 
to incorporate some fringy accents and some plastics 
and whites and beiges, but the overall effect gave me 
baby’s-?rst-Halloween-cowboy-costume. It wasn’t quite 
a success, but I did appreciate some of what they tried to 
do — the diagonal slit up one of the skirts, for one.
Next was Fukkatsu by sophomore art major Cindy Hsu 
and sophomore communication design major Sharon Yu. 
Fukkatsu “means revival in Japanese,” and this collection 
was pretty lively. With some stunning patterns, the 
pieces seemed to ?ow and swim together alongside the 
Koi ?sh pictured on nearly each garment. This collection 
played with geometries and strictness — ranging from 
sharp shoulder pad wings to slouchy hoods — and I quite 
enjoyed it.
Exuviae, by senior architecture majors Noopur 
Suckhlecha, Jenny Wong, and Marnfah Kanjanavanit 
was an experience. This was hands-down tied for my 
favorite collection, and let me tell you why: exoskeletons. 
“Exuviae are the empty exoskeleton remains...after 
a skin-shedding process.” This collection featured 
beautifully crafted plastic accessories which made the 
relatively simply blue pieces come alive. From a beautiful 
and realistic spinal cord to some clipped wings, this 
collection stood out as not only one of the best concepts, 
but also a great experience. The spinal cord, modeled by 
model coordinator and ?ne arts senior, Alex Walker, was 
the only real reveal of the show; he strutted down the 
runway and turned around, and I swear, the front row just 
gasped.
Up next was Erode by sophomore mechanical 
engineering major Jonathan Lopez, junior design major 
Zai Aliyu, and sophomore art major Kate Werth. This 
collection “explores continually changing environments 
... through the use of black, white, and an organically 
manipulated grid structure.” For me, this is a collection 
that could have bene?ted from a different order. I think 
that there was some potential here for a clearer narrative 
to be told, but I didn’t quite see it in action. Most of 
the pieces had some bits cut out, in varying depths 
and revealing various shades of black/gray, and a more 
coherent sequence might have made this collection 
stand out more.
Last, but certainly not least, was Sanctum by senior 
decision science major Sasha Kerbel and senior 
humanities and arts major Madalyn Gryger. This 
collection “explores the experience of living with 
mental illness.” It. was. amazing. Absolutely grand. The 
soundtrack was completely mood-setting and terrifying, 
and the second this collection hit the runway, all eyes 
were glued. This collection featured some intricate 
beadwork, and nearly all of the models were wearing 
masks, some more aggressive than others. The ?rst 
model wore a ripped leather bodysuit and a leather head 
covering with a ripped cut-out a la Hannibal Lecter. 
Another model wore a pretty masquerade mask, which I 
thought was very ?tting for the concept, and still another 
wore a wire mesh face covering, which looked horribly 
painful. This collection was tied with Exuviae, in my 
opinion, for overall best collection.
And there you have it! The 20th anniversary of Lunar 
Gala was quite an experience, and it serves as a stylish 
reminder of the power of our student community here at 
Carnegie Mellon.

10beyoncé
pillbox 02.15.16
I love Beyoncé probably more than the average 
person. I feel connected to her on such a deep level 
that sometimes I think we are the same person. Think 
about it, have you ever seen both of us in the same 
room at the same time? I didn’t think so. When she 
released her video for “Formation” the day before the 
Super Bowl, I literally lost it. 
As someone who grew up in Houston, whose parents 
are from New Orleans, and whose grandfather is 
from Alabama, I felt a personal connection when 
she says in the song “My daddy Alabama, Momma 
Louisiana. You mix that negro with that Creole make 
a Texas bamma.” Beyoncé channeled her southern, 
black roots in this song and video inspired by New 
Orleans. You can call me biased because I am a black, 
southern girl, but I loved every minute of it.
New Orleans has a special spot in my heart. Not only 
are my parents from there, but I grew up spending 
a month there every summer and I consider it my 
second home. The music video opens with a female 
voice asking in a New Orleans accent, “What 
happened after New Orleans?” As she says this, 
houses are shown submerged in water to recreate 
scenes from Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst 
storms that the city has ever had to try and bounce 
back from. 
Beyoncé, in all her glory, is perched on top of a 
submerged police car dismissing her haters for 
accusing her of being in the Illuminati. While Beyoncé 
is singing, the music builds up as various scenes 
of New Orleans are shown. Finally, the beat drops 
as Beyoncé and her backup dancers begin to dance 
inside a beautiful house modeled to look like one of 
the many plantation homes in New Orleans.
Beyoncé then goes on to acknowledge that she loves 
the very things about Blue Ivy and Jay Z that they 
have been criticized for their black features such as 
afro hair, big lips, and noses. She compares Jay Z’s 
nose to those of the Jackson 5, and shows Blue Ivy 
dancing in a group with two younger girls which is 
probably the cutest thing I’ve seen all year.
Beyoncé has always received criticism from the 
black community for being a “sell out” because 
she presents herself with blond, unnatural hair and 
because she has lighter skin. This was simultaneously 
a testament to mainstream media that she loves 
features that have historically not been seen as 
beautiful, and to the black community that she 
appreciates our natural beauty despite how she 
presents herself.
She also acknowledges that despite her success, 
she’s still a country girl that carries hot sauce with 
her everywhere. While hot sauce is not my preferred 
method of spicing food, I do understand where she’s 
coming from. Spicy food is the best thing to ever 
grace the face of the Earth, and I always keep a jar of 
jalapeños in my fridge that I have been known to put 
on everything.
Then there is another break in the music as local New 
Orleans celebrity and Bounce music artist Big Freedia 
asserts that she is not here to play around. Through 
the line “I like cornbreads and collard greens,” Big 
Freedia sends a message that you can still love soul 
food and be “hood” even if you’re successful.
Beyonce’s success has not changed her personality. 
While this is being said, Beyoncé shows several 
scenes of different New Orleans neighborhoods. 
What I love about this part of the music video is 
that she doesn’t show the parts of New Orleans 
that everyone always sees such as St. Charles Ave, 
the French Quarter, and the Natchez ferry on the 
Mississippi River. Instead, she shows scenes that 
aren’t typically seen, scenes meant to represent the 
poorer neighborhoods of New Orleans such as the 
ninth and seventh wards. She shows a different side 
of the city — the side that didn’t bounce back from 
Katrina despite being home to a majority of the city’s 
population.
Following this are several scenes of Beyoncé dancing 
with all-black backup dancers, which only adds to her 
message of how much she loves her people. The song 
then switches gears as Beyoncé goes on a cocky, 
but well-earned rant about how much she slays. She 
asserts her dominance by saying things like she’s 
going to take Jay-Z to Red Lobster and she’s going 
to take him to the mall and let him buy shoes and 
ride in her helicopter. Typically in songs, men are 
talking about how they’re going to do these things 
for women, but I love the way Beyoncé lets everyone 
know that she is in charge and Jay-Z is just along for 
the ride.
Beyoncé is then shown riding in an old school style 
car with her hair hanging out looking like a beautiful, 
black Rapunzel. The music video then ends with 
more scenes of submerged houses being shown as 
the police car that Beyoncé is sitting on sinks with 
her on top of it. Voices can be heard saying “Look at 
that water,” which is another allusion to Hurricane 
Katrina.
Personally, I love this music video. I love the imagery, 
the bragging, the pride, and the representation 
of Beyoncé as someone who got taken out of the 
country, but didn’t get the country taken out of her.
However, there has been a lot of backlash to this 
music video from white people because only black 
people are shown in the video, to which I would 
respond: pro-black is not anti-white. Beyoncé is 
making a testament about how proud she is to be 
what she is and to be where she’s from. She does not 
once even mention white people. Beyoncé is black, 
let her be black. This song is to remind everyone 
that despite the glitz and glamour and how much 
everyone seems to love her, she’s still black and she is 
still with us during racial injustice. 
I loved every minute of this video and definitely think 
it is worth the watch. Hopefully it will make some 
people think that us loving ourselves does not mean 
we hate white people; it just means we want you 
to also accept us as we are without conforming to 
societal, white beauty standards.
