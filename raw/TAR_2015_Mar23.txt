Peduto talks plan for city with Senate
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
After a last minute cancel-
lation the week before spring 
break, the mayor of Pittsburgh 
Bill Peduto visited Carnegie 
Mellon’s Student Senate last 
Thursday. Mayor Peduto, who 
gave only a few days notice 
for his visit to Margaret Mor-
rison Hall’s Breed Hall for 
Senate’s weekly general body 
meeting, spoke about a range 
of topics relevant to students. 
He also took questions from 
senators and other students in 
attendance.
Evan Wineland, junior in-
formation systems major and 
chair of Student Senate, said 
that he had been in touch 
with a member of Peduto’s 
staff before the meeting, and 
had a long-running relation-
ship with Dan Gilman (HSS 
’04), a Carnegie Mellon alum-
nus and city councilman for 
Pittsburgh’s eighth district, 
who spoke to Senate with the 
mayor.
Mayor Peduto began by 
talking about public transpor-
tation in Pittsburgh, which is 
currently limited to buses and 
a light rail system, commonly 
known as “The T.” Earlier 
that day at the annual meet-
ing of the Pittsburgh Down-
town Partnership, Peduto an-
nounced a plan for reworking 
the streets in Downtown. The 
$32 million plan, Envision 
Downtown, aims to make 
streets downtown more aes-
thetically pleasing, less con-
gested, and safer. Peduto said 
to Senate that he wants a sys-
tem of “complete streets” — 
streets that are safe and ef?-
cient for pedestrians, drivers, 
bicyclists, and those taking 
public transportation.
“Today we announced a 
bold step,” Peduto said. “To-
day we announced a plan 
about what the next city is 
going to be. It’s not the city 
that David Lawrence saw, and 
we’re not going to demolish a 
thing — in fact, we’re going to 
preserve parts of it. And we’re 
going to create a complete 
streets model for all of Down-
town, and then take it into 
Oakland.”
Penelope Ackerman, a 
sophomore materials sci-
ence and engineering major, 
was particularly interested 
in what the mayor had to say 
about Pittsburgh’s roads: “I re-
ally liked what he said about 
transportation,” Ackerman 
said. “Probably because I’m 
doing research this summer 
on transportation, so that’s 
something I’m really inter-
ested in. So when he was 
mentioning the rail coming 
throughout the city and run-
ning southwest, I think that’s 
a major key in promoting 
people to go Downtown and 
travel through Pittsburgh. I 
think eventually that would 
allow students to get more en-
gaged.”
When asked if the city had 
plans to signi?cantly expand 
the T, Peduto said that it was 
unlikely. “No — that’s the an-
swer,” Peduto said, noting that 
such infrastructure reform in 
other, similar cities took mil-
lions of dollars and spanned 
years. “We’ve had all this op-
portunity to do it. Someone 
somewhere in the ‘70s tried 
to. They called it the ‘spine 
line’ and then they just killed 
it, and no one’s done it again.”
Peduto echoed many of 
the points he made last time 
he visited Carnegie Mellon, 
when he spoke to the Pitts-
burgh Student Government 
Council about the future of 
the city. Peduto cited Carn-
egie Mellon president Richard 
Cyert for envisioning a future 
of Pittsburgh based on educa-
tion and innovation, outside 
of its traditional steel mills 
and manufacturing core.
Gilman emphasized the 
importance of keeping young 
college graduates in Pitts-
burgh, saying, “we need to 
do more to let students know 
A) what’s happening in the 
city and B) how to affordably 
and easily experience it and 
achieve it. So they’ll be like 
‘Wow, I’d love to live in Law-
renceville when I graduate, 
that’s a pretty sweet neighbor-
hood,’ rather than like ‘Well, 
the only Lawrenceville I know 
is in New Jersey.’ ”
The mayor also mentioned 
the city’s nascent internship 
program; beginning this sum-
mer, the city will be taking 
100 interns across its depart-
ments, including “the police, 
municipal investigations, 
planning, the Mayor’s of?ce, 
engineering, [and] City Coun-
cil,” Peduto said.
Gilman and Peduto ended 
their visit on a bright note for 
the city’s future. “My entire 
life, and I’m 50, I’ve never seen 
the city grow,” Peduto said. 
“And in the next 20 years, I 
want to see it grow by 20,000 
[people].”

Since arriving at Carnegie 
Mellon, Nkindé Ambalo took 
the political fast track in stu-
dent government. Just a year 
after joining, the sophomore 
mechanical engineering ma-
jor has found himself the 
Academic Affairs Committee 
chair for Student Senate.
He has ?lled the shoes of 
last year’s chair, junior deci-
sion science major Julia Eddy, 
inheriting the responsibility 
of the Academic Relationship 
Code (ARC).
The ARC is a proposed 
guideline for students and 
teachers, intended to im-
prove student-faculty rela-
tionships. Ambalo has been 
pushing the ARC within the 
Academic Affairs Committee 
since he assumed of?ce in 
late August last year.
There are two reasons that 
the committee has pushed to 
complete the ARC, according 
to Ambalo. “Firstly, there are 
a lot of issues teachers have 
with students not being up-
front with their coursework,” 
he said. “And secondly, in stu-
dent opinion, there is an am-
biguity about teachers’ policy 
on late work, excusable work 
that should be clearly laid out 
in the syllabus.”
Within the document, the 
committee focused primarily 
on the academic handling of 
what they call “exceptional 
circumstances.” Exceptional 
circumstances could include 
family emergencies, inter-
views for the professional 
world, or school sporting 
events that con?ict with 
coursework. The committee 
seeks to make professors and 
students more open to com-
municating things like dead-
line issues or makeup dates. 
There has been very little 
legislation in the past that 
clearly de?ned what excep-
tional circumstances teach-
ers should allow as a bare 
minimum.
To move the code from 
being merely a written docu-
ment to a breathing policy, 
Ambalo enlisted the help of 
high-ranking administrators, 
like Vice Provost for Educa-
tion Amy Burkert.
“I asked Dr. Burkert and 
faculty about the Academic 
Relationship Code,” Ambalo 
said on working with fac-
ulty. “And they said that they 
wanted this to happen be-
cause faculty can ?nd it hard 
to trust students.”
Ambalo stressed the im-
portance of these leaders’ 
support to institute wide-
spread changes to faculty 
approaches. He cited the 
growing impatience fac-
ulty members have toward 
the way students approach 
conversation: “Some fac-
ulty members have had very 
bad experiences in the past. 
These are the things that 
?y around the water cooler. 
They talk about students ly-
ing to get off work or make 
up a test.”
In fact, these communica-
tion issues within the student 
body are the very reason Am-
balo chose to put the ARC at 
the forefront of his agenda as 
chair.
Ambalo is most concerned 
about the culture of silence 
that he sees affecting the 
overall student body at Carn-
egie Mellon. Students are of-
ten not comfortable enough 
to speak up, Ambalo said. 
From discussing possible im-
provements to the student 
body stress culture to mobi-
lizing city exploration with 
the Strip District crawl, and 
now with the ARC, Student 
Senate is moving forward 
with its goals to improve stu-
dent life.

A device developed at 
the Robotics Institute made 
its ?rst appearance at the 
SXSW Interactive Festival in 
Austin,Texas.
The device, Speck, will 
track the quality of air within 
a person’s home by identify-
ing the “level of ?ne particu-
late matter suspended in the 
air,” according to a Carnegie 
Mellon news release.
It will identify exposure 
to PM2.5, particles that can 
negatively affect the heart 
and lungs.
“Sometimes you can see 
air pollution as a haze in the 
distance, but in and around 
your home, it’s invisible,” 
said Illah Nourbakhsh, pro-
fessor of robotics, in the 
news release. The device 
was created in Nourbakhsh’s 
CREATE lab and is now mar-
keted by spinoff Airviz, Inc.
The release states that 
about 300 Specks are in use 
in the Pittsburgh area.
The device has a screen 
that shows the quality of air 
in the home, and records 
data about the air over time 
that can be uploaded to a 
database. The Heinz Endow-
ment and Pittsburgh Foun-
dation paid for 1,000 Specks 
to be used in public libraries, 
schools, and other groups in 
the Pittsburgh area, accord-
ing to the release.

Junior information sys-
tems major Evan Wineland 
is running for Student Body 
President with sophomore 
math major Connie Yang as 
his Student Body Vice Presi-
dent running mate.
The pair is running on a 
platform of raising student 
wages, improving student-
faculty connections, and pro-
viding more opportunities to 
experience Pittsburgh.
Wineland and Yang pro-
pose to increase the current 
campus minimum wage from 
$7.25 per hour to $11 per hour 
by 2020, citing current hourly 
rates of $12 at Yale University, 
$13.25 at Stanford Univer-
sity, and $10 at Harvard Uni-
versity, among others. They 
argue that raising the wage 
will allow students to work 
fewer hours to become more 
involved elsewhere.
They also propose institut-
ing student-faculty lunch pro-
grams, in which students can 
engage with faculty outside 
of the classroom. They hope 
to connect students better to 
the faculty who teach them 
by following models similar 
to those offered at Dartmouth 
College and Duke University.
Finally, they are pushing 
to give students more access 
to Pittsburgh with proposed 
events like a Craig Street 
Crawl, similar to the ?rst Sen-
ate Strip District Crawl at the 
start of the school year, as 
well as routine discounts at 
various businesses for Carn-
egie Mellon Students.
“We are the only ticket that 
can claim that it has made tan-
gible progress on every single 
item in our platform,” Wine-
land said via email. “Connie 
and I have been meeting with 
students, Warner Hall admin-
istrators, and city of?cials 
about our ideas since Janu-
ary.... We were pleased that 
in the debates last Friday, our 
platform stood out as the only 
one with clear ideas and con-
crete plans for execution.”
Wineland is currently the 
chair of Student Senate and 
a resident assistant in West 
Wing. He is involved with 
the Student Government 
Executive Committee, the 
President’s Student Advisory 
Council, and Highland Am-
bassadors. He is also a mem-
ber of the Survivor Support 
Network and a brother of 
Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Yang is involved in the 
current SBP’s cabinet, the 
CMU math team, Women in 
Science, the William Low-
ell Putnam Mathematical 
Competition, CMU in Haiti, 
and Kappa Alpha Theta. She 
is also a GroupX instructor, 
chair of the university’s Proud 
to be Plaid committee, and 
a webpage designer for the 
Econobite project.
“My experience in Senate 
and in [Student Government] 
was perfectly complemented 
by [Connie’s] background 
working in the current Stu-
dent Body President’s cabi-
net,” Wineland said in the 
email. “Having very different 
extra-curricular backgrounds 
means we’ve connected with 
a wide diversity of students 
on campus.”

Senior statistics and eco-
nomics double major Saif 
Jedidi is running for Student 
Body President (SBP) with 
sophomore computer science 
major Ben Debebe as the tick-
et’s Student Body Vice Presi-
dent (SBVP) candidate. They 
are running on a platform of 
“Decimating Opposition,” 
which parodies Evan Wine-
land and Connie Yang’s cam-
paign. Wineland and Yang’s 
slogan is “Breaking Barriers.”
According to the pair’s 
website, which is stylistically 
almost identical to Wineland 
and Yang’s, the opposition 
that Jedidi and Debebe in-
tend to decimate comes from 
wild life, student-faculty con-
nections, and corruption. Ac-
cording to their website, they 
hope to hire 38 poachers to 
protect students from campus 
wildlife, create a program for 
students and faculty to have 
lunch, and make it easier for 
students to bribe professors 
and administrators.
When asked what sets 
them apart, Jedidi said via 
email, “I am by far the most 
quali?ed candidate for this 
position. For one, I am a 
graduating senior, whereas 
the other candidates are all 
juniors or younger. Vis-à-vis, 
furthermore, concordantly, I 
am older than them.”
“I think we care about how 
students feel,” Debebe said. 
“We’re not looking to make 
monumental changes in the 
Student Government. We’re 
looking to look out for our fel-
low students.”
Debebe made an earnest 
case for the platform, saying 
that one of the largest barriers 
on campus is the connection 
between students and faculty: 
“At the moment, it’s very dif?-
cult to reach out on a personal 
level. If we could give stu-
dents a means of meeting up 
with teachers in a social set-
ting — getting lunches, meet-
ing at events — I think that 
would contribute to breaking 
down some of those barriers.”
Debebe indicated that stu-
dent safety — and not just 
from bears — is at the mo-
ment a major issue: “I don’t 
think a lot of students feel 
safe on campus. You hear a lot 
of things about sexual assault 
and suicide, and I think in 
general people in Pittsburgh 
don’t feel safe. Saif and I are 
people who can really make 
students feel safe.”
He also believes that one of 
the largest issues with the cur-
rent Student Government is a 
lack of transparency and ac-
cessibility for students: “I for 
one don’t really know about 
what happens on a case-by-
case basis. If I got into of?ce, 
addressing that would be 
something at the forefront of 
my agenda.”
While it is unclear what 
will happen if a graduating 
senior is elected, the cur-
rent election rules allow any 
graduate or undergraduate 
student currently enrolled at 
Carnegie Mellon to run for 
elected positions. Jedidi’s 
senior status, as well as the 
campaign website, have led 
to speculation that their cam-
paign is not a serious one. 
Their platform promotes 
poaching and bribery, and 
their campaign staff includes 
such members as Helga G. 
Pataki from the cartoon Hey 
Arnold!, Al Gore, and “All Sea 
Creatures.”
Jedidi emphasized being a 
senior in an email when asked 
what sets him apart from oth-
er candidates: “I would just 
like to emphasize again that 
my experience extends all the 
way to my senior year of col-
lege,” he wrote. “I am essen-
tially done with my degree at 
this point, and will be leaving 
CMU in just a few months to 
become a real person, where-
as all the other candidates 
will still be students next year. 
Does CMU really want some-
one who is still a student to be 
the Student Body President?”

Junior electrical and com-
puter engineering major Di-
vya Kothandapani is running 
for Student Body President 
with third year Ph.D. can-
didate in mechanical engi-
neering Mark Whiting as her 
Student Body Vice President 
running mate.
Kothandapani and Whit-
ing are running on a platform 
of creating more transparency 
between administration and 
the student body, connecting 
students across majors, years, 
and clubs, and improving the 
student experience.
The pair proposes to in-
crease transparency between 
administrators and the stu-
dent body by instituting 
newsletters from Carnegie 
Mellon governing bodies il-
lustrating such things as ren-
ovations, tuition increases, 
and transportation options. 
They also plan to publicize 
initiatives frequently and 
provide listening opportuni-
ties through resources like 
surveys, town halls, and indi-
vidual conversations.
To increase connections 
between students and im-
prove school spirit, the pair 
proposes improved phone 
apps and digital calendars for 
campus events. They also sug-
gest more activities to bring 
together the entire campus 
community and more ways 
for graduate students and 
undergraduates to have the 
same opportunities for cam-
pus activities.
To improve the student 
experience and make cam-
pus safer, Kothandapani and 
Whiting, among a number 
of initiatives, want to begin 
recognizing non-academic 
achievements, streamlining 
student organization and 
activities processes, and pro-
viding more ways for college 
spirit to permeate across the 
student body. 
They also want all major 
committees to be focused on 
both the undergraduate and 
graduate experience.
“We represent the two 
largest groups on campus: un-
dergraduates and graduates,” 
Kothandapani said. “With the 
varying range of needs and 
concerns from the graduate 
population, it is dif?cult to 
truly understand the gradu-
ate perspective unless you are 
a graduate student yourself. 
As a [graduate student], Mark 
will properly advocate on be-
half of this group.”
Kothandapani is cur-
rently the student body vice 
president for ?nance and 
contributes to the current 
student body president’s ad-
visory council and board of 
directors. 
She was previously chair of 
Senate’s business affairs com-
mittee, and is a Mudge House 
mentor. She is a member of 
the CIT Community Building 
Committee.
Whiting is the Gradu-
ate Student Assembly’s vice 
president for ?nance and the 
chief ?nancial of?cer for the 
National Association of Grad-
uate and Professional Stu-
dents. He was previously an 
of?cer in the Explorers Club 
and an executive consultant 
for Public Communication for 
Researchers.
“We also both have exten-
sive background and knowl-
edge about campus ?nances 
and operations at both the 
undergrad and grad levels,” 
Kothandapani said. “Under-
standing how CMU’s ?nances 
work, where money can be 
pulled from, and how to best 
request funding resources 
puts us at an incredible 
advantage.”

Junior policy and man-
agement and Chinese stud-
ies double major JR Marshall 
is running for Student Body 
President (SBP) with run-
ning mate Jibby Ayo-Ani, a 
junior information systems 
major who hopes to become 
the Student Body Vice Presi-
dent. They are running on a 
platform focused on creating 
a more inclusive campus cul-
ture to represent all 13,000 
students on campus, and help 
set the school on the path 
to being widely considered 
equal to other large name uni-
versities both inside and out-
side of the Ivy League.
“Our platform is also long 
term and short term. We be-
lieve the university is at ... a 
turning point in its history,” 
Marshall said. “It could be-
come a household name. This 
is a focal year — this is a year 
where Student Government 
and the student body are go-
ing to determine if we get on 
that path.”
“We really centered our 
platform around where we 
believe this campus can go,” 
Ayo-Ani said of their goals. 
“We really want to provide a 
very deliverable platform.”
Based on the phrase “Re-
orient, Empower, Serve,” 
their goals include creating 
a “Reorientation Day” where 
students would take a day 
off from classes toward the 
middle of the semester. The 
day would be used to pro-
mote mindfulness and allow 
students to re?ect on their 
time at the school. Other key 
planks of their platform in-
clude an increase in the fre-
quency of the school’s shut-
tles and more routes taking 
students to more regions of 
the city. 
They also want to expand 
the number of businesses that 
accept DineX, and emphasize 
the need for more collabora-
tion and student representa-
tion, as well as mental health 
awareness and measures to 
combat sexual assault and re-
lationship violence.
Marshall led the founding 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Phi Delta 
Theta fraternity and served as 
president, which he says has 
given him leadership experi-
ence: “I worked with a bevy 
of people, students, advisors,

When asked why they felt 
they should run, Marshall 
said, “For me, it was a culmi-

invested in this community 
and it would be a great omis-
sion to not put myself forward 
to make this happen.”
“This university has given 
us the world and we intend to 
do nothing less than give back 
to this community,” Ayo-Ani 
added.

Ryan LaPré, a sophomore 
math and economics double 
major, is running for Student 
Body Vice President for Orga-
nizations (SBVPO).
In his platform, he focuses 
on increasing the SBVPO’s 
contact and support for or-
ganizations, as well as im-
proving the culture within 
student organizations at the 
university.
LaPré said that, if elected, 
he would ?rst build a strong 
relationship with the Com-
mittee on Student Organiza-
tions (CoSo) and focus on the 
recognition process for young 
organizations.
“I would look at increas-
ing communication and a 
strong communication between 
organizations,” LaPré said. 
“Usually, members will go 
through committee meetings 
and go to organization meet-
ings and check in with ... ad-
ministrators, but the contact 
tapers off. I would like to have 
increased communication 
throughout the year — keep 
open minds of communica-
tion so that if groups run into 
trouble at any point of the 
year, we can help them out 
[with] the support of Student 
Government.”
According to LaPré, an-
other problem is the lack of 
record keeping for different 
organizations. In the CoSo 
process, there are not a lot of 
organization records being 
kept. 
If elected, LaPré plans 
to “increase the amount of 
knowledge the [SBVPO] 
keeps.”
“I would like to create a 
system where [the SBVPO] 
can keep the information 
of what groups are recog-
nized as, and when and what 
kinds of questions do we ask 
throughout the year in the 
young recognition process,” 
LaPré said. “Every year we are 
not coming back to the same 
questions, which makes it a 
little unfair for them.”
Young organizations must 
go through a process with 
Student Government to be-
come recognized by the body 
and receive Joint Funding 
Committee money.
LaPré said that being on 
CoSo has prepared him for be-
ing SBVPO: “Having someone 
[from CoSo] in the VPO posi-
tion can keep the strong bond 
between members while also 
making them very effective 
for student organizations as 
much as we can.”
LaPré is also Chair of the 
Internal Development Com-
mittee of Student Senate, a 
member of Scotch ‘n’ Soda 
Theatre, and a member of the 
Spring Carnival Committee. 
He has also fenced with the 
Club Fencing team.

Trevor Hadick, a sopho-
more chemical engineering 
and engineering and public 
policy double major, is run-
ning for Student Body Vice 
President for Organizations 
(SBVPO) on a platform of in-
creasing student involvement 
through open communica-
tion. Hadick ran for the posi-
tion last year as well.
“Some of the things I want-
ed to ?x last year still haven’t 
been ?xed, so those things go 
on to my agenda ?rst,” Hadick 
said. “The number of students 
who are involved is very low. 
It was my [agenda] last year 
and will continue to be on 
[it].”
Hadick also plans to 
change the way organizations 
reserve rooms. Currently, 
organizations book rooms 
through a website called 
25Live. He thinks “it is a hor-
rible system that makes plan-
ning events harder.”
He also said that he will fo-
cus on allocating student or-
ganization space through the 
University Center Allocation 
Board (UCAB), noting that is 
is important for the space to 
be divided fairly in the best 
interest of all organizations. 
UCAB makes decisions every 
other year as to which student 
organizations will gain access 
to student space, primarily on 
the third ?oor of the Jared L. 
Cohon University Center.
Hadick said he under-
stands the dif?culty of becom-
ing recognized as a student 
organization as well, saying in 
his platform that the current 
process keeps “many great 
organizations on campus 
from ?nishing the application 
process.”
“I know how dif?cult it 
is and I think having gone 
through [organization pro-
cesses] makes that much of 
a difference,” Hadick said of 
himself.
He is currently part of the 
student body president’s cabi-
net, as well as the treasurer for 
the men’s club soccer team. 
He is also part of the College 
of Engineering Community 
Building Committee (CBC).
He noted that a success-
ful SBVPO would need to be 
openly communicative with 
others and willing to take 
criticism. 
He said it is important 
to have “the ability to make 
tough decisions for the best 
of this school. Since it is [a 
UCAB] year, as a group we 
will make tough decisions.” 
Hadick stressed the need 
to talk to organizations dur-
ing the UCAB process to make 
sure they understand the de-
cisions that the body makes 
regarding space access.

Junior math major Benja-
min Zhang is running unop-
posed for Student Body Vice 
President for Finance (SBVPF). 
Zhang’s platform empha-
sizes ?scal transparency and 
an improved Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) allocation 
process.
Zhang has experience in 
student government; he cur-
rently serves in Student Sen-
ate for the Mellon College of 
Science and sits on the body’s 
Finance Committee, which 
metes out Senate’s special al-
location fund. Zhang is also 
a member of the JFC, which 
is overseen by the SBVPF 
and allocates funding gener-
ated by the Student Activi-
ties Fee to over 200 campus 
organizations.
“One of my initiatives as 
SBVPF would be to increase 
?scal transparency at all lev-
els, including working with 
the university to release more 
?nancial information pertain-
ing to how money is spent,” 
Zhang wrote in his platform. 
“Students should be informed 
about where their money goes 
to, whether it’s the student ac-
tivities fee or tuition dollars.”
Zhang said during last 
Wednesday’s debate that ?scal 
transparency should not apply 
to just student government.
He promises to work with 
the university, as well as other 
organizations that parcel out 
money, such as the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC), to 
make ?scal information more 
readily accessible for campus 
members.
Zhang is also placing a fo-
cus on making the JFC funding 
system more clear and giving 
student organization leaders 
a more prominent voice in the 
process.
“A lot of organizations are 
confused by how JFC allocates 
money, and how we come up 
with our metrics,” Zhang said 
on Wednesday. “One of my 
goals is to host an open met-
rics meeting, in which stu-
dents can propose their own 
metrics.”
This metric, Zhang wrote 
in his platform, “will allow the 
JFC to make more informed 
decisions to create allocations 
that better serve the needs of 
student organizations.”
Zhang, according to his 
platform, is currently work-
ing on an initiative in Senate 
to index all funding sources at 
Carnegie Mellon that students 
and organizations can access.
Outside of Student Senate, 
Zhang does research for the 
Statistics Department and is a 
brother of Delta Tau Delta, as 
well as a member of the Spring 
Carnival Committee.Abhinav Gautam/Photo Editor

New Alzheimer’s drug slows cognitive decline
A new, experimental drug 
developed by Biogen Indec 
sharply slowed decline in 
cognitive function in a small, 
clinical trial of Alzheimer’s 
patients. The drug, called 
aducanumab or BIIB037, is de-
signed to rid the brain of amy-
loid plaque, which is widely 
believed to be the cause of 
dementia in Alzheimer’s pa-
tients.
The trial consisted of 166 
patients randomly assigned 
to get either the drug or a pla-
cebo; the drug not only slowed 
cognitive decline but also sub-
stantially reduced plaque in 
the brain. Higher doses were 
more effective than lower 
doses. 
The results were presented 
in Nice, France, at the Interna-
tional Conference on Alzheim-
er’s and Parkinson’s Diseases 
and Related Neurological Dis-
orders. Biogen hopes to begin 
larger trials sometime this 
year.

Crocodile ancestor was top predator before dinosaurs
A newly discovered croco-
dilian ancestor, Carnufex caro-
linensis, is believed to have 
been North America’s top 
predator before dinosaurs ar-
rived on the continent. 
Carnufex was a 9-foot long, 
land-dwelling crocodylo-
morph that walked on its hind 
legs, preying upon armored 
reptiles and early mammal 
relatives.
Paleontologists from North 
Carolina State University and 
the North Carolina Museum 
of Natural Sciences recov-
ered parts of Carnufex’s skull, 
spine, and upper forelimb 
from the Pekin Formation in 
Chatham County, North Caro-

Stars forming in dust cloud in nearby galaxy
An international team of 
researchers have discovered 
that over one million stars are 
forming in a dust cloud bur-
ied within a supernebula in a 
dwarf galaxy known as NGC 
5253, in the constellation Cen-
taurus. The dust surrounding 
these stars is approximately 
15,000 times larger than the 
mass of our sun, and is around 
3 million years old — rela-
tively young in astronomical 
terms.
“I’ve been searching for 
the gas cloud that is forming 
the supernebula and its star 
cluster for years. Now we have 
detected it,” said Jean Turner, 
a professor of physics and as-
tronomy in the University of 
California, Los Angeles Col-
lege and lead author of the 
research.

New 3-D printer inspired by Terminator 2
A new 3-D printing tech-
nique works 100 times faster 
than conventional 3-D print-
ers by lifting objects out of a 
pool of resin. 
The technique was derived 
from a scene in Terminator 
2, in which the T-1000 ro-
bot rises from a pot of mol-
ten metal. The idea was to 
have “an object rise out of a 
puddle in real time with es-
sentially no waste,” explained 
Joseph DeSimone, a professor 
of chemistry at University of 
North Carolina and a founder 
of the company Carbon3D.
The technique, called Con-
tinuous Liquid Interface Pro-
duction (CLIP), uses a moving 
platform to lift printed objects 
out of a reservoir of liquid 
resin. 
The technique combines 
pulses of light, solidifying the 
resin, and oxygen, which pre-
vents parts of the resin from 
solidifying, to craft intricate 
three-dimensional objects.

Mushrooms found to glow in order to attract insects
The luminous fungus Neo-
nothopanus gardneri, which 
grows at the base of palm 
trees in Brazilian forests, lights 
up to attract insects that will 
spread its spores, according to 
a recent study. 
To ?nd the reason for the 
glow, scientists placed mush-
room decoys at tree bases and 
lit some of the decoys with 
green LEDs to mimic the real 
mushroom’s bioluminescence-
while leaving the others with-
out LEDs.
After ?ve nights, the sci-
entists found the luminescent 
decoys had more insects. They 
collected 12 insects from the 
dark mushrooms and 42 in-
sects from the glowing ones, 
concluding that the purpose of 
the glow was to attract insects. 
It was also determined 
that the mushrooms follow a 
rhythm, which allows them to 
only light up at night.
The study was published 
online in Current Biology.

Solar eclipse witnessed by millions in the UK
This past Friday, millions 
of people across the United 
Kingdom and Northern Eu-
rope witnessed a solar eclipse, 
which occurs when the moon 
comes between the Earth and 
the sun. BBC footage revealed 
interesting features regard-
ing the eclipse, namely a clear 
view of “Baily’s beads,” the 
light at the edge of the Moon.
In all parts of the UK, the 
eclipse reached 83 percent, 
with the darkness peaking at 
about 09:35 GMT. The period 
of greatest darkness lasted 
nearly three minutes and oc-
curred over a spot in the Nor-
wegian Sea at 09:46 GMT.
Researchers at the National 
Eclipse Weather Experiment 
asked the public to record 
weather conditions during the 
eclipse in order to improve fu-
ture weather forecasting. The 
UK will not experience a so-
lar eclipse of this magnitude 
again until 2026.

Recent research by Matt 
Walker, a professor of physics 
at Carnegie Mellon, and Alex 
Geringer-Sameth, a post-doc-
torate physics student at Carn-
egie Mellon, in collaboration 
with Savvas Koushiappas, an 
assistant professor of phys-
ics at Brown University, and 
a team of cosmologists from 
the University of Cambridge, 
may lay down the groundwork 
for understanding one of the 
universe’s greatest mysteries: 
dark matter.
Not much is known about 
dark matter. It is said to com-
prise about 80 percent of the 
matter in the universe and 
cannot be seen using any cur-
rent technology. All of dark 
matter’s properties have been 
inferred based on its gravi-
tational interactions, such as 
causing the rotation of galax-
ies and the expansion of the 
universe. In short, dark matter 
is a hypothetical type of mat-
ter that is thought to explain 
some of the universe’s un-
explained phenomena. Dark 
matter is thought to exist out-
side the realm of conventional 
physics, meaning it is thought 
to be something other than 
standard matter. The team’s 
research suggests that dark 
matter may have a “particle 
nature,” which would make 
dark matter researchable be-
yond its gravitational proper-
ties. The implications of this 
are widespread for cosmolo-
gists and may open new doors 
in the search for dark matter.
Current theories suggest 
that when two particles of 
dark matter collide, they pro-
duce normal particles and 
gamma radiation, or high 
energy electromagnetic parti-
cles. While these gamma rays 
are consistent with theories 
explaining dark matter’s par-
ticle interactions, it is a large 
assumption to say that this is 
the most likely scenario. In 
fact, both NASA and the Cam-
bridge group performed their 
own analyses of the data and 
found nothing of any signi?-
cance. There is a very large 
margin of error in analysis of 
deep space phenomena, but 
even the possibility of dark 
matter displaying particle in-
teractions is enough to keep 
research teams invested.
“Dwarf galaxies are like big 
clumps of dark matter,” says 
Geringer-Sameth, “they’re 
very clean systems.” Dwarf 
galaxies are the best systems 
for examining dark matter, 
so when researchers at Cam-
bridge University discovered 
nine new dwarf galaxies, the 
research team pounced on the 
data. “For the past few years, 
I’ve been working on ways to 
do this kind of dark matter 
search … it’s just that there’s 
a limited number of dwarf 
galaxies.” Using publicly avail-
able data from NASA’s Fermi 
telescope, which detects gam-
ma rays, the team explored 
the gamma ray emission from 
the coordinates of the newly 
discovered dwarves.
The possibility of gamma 
radiation caused by dark 
matter interactions is of great 
importance in the realm of 
physics because it reinforces 
the theory that dark matter 
has a particle nature. This the-
ory suggests that dark matter 
may behave at least vaguely 
like normal matter, and there-
fore may be more readily re-
searchable. “Over the past 
few decades,” says Geringer-
Sameth, “people have come to 
realize that the vast majority 
of matter in the universe — 
[dark matter] — exists outside 
the standard model for par-
ticle physics. There is a huge 
quest to ?gure out the particle 
nature of dark matter.”
The fundamental goals of 
physics are to explain mat-
ter and its interactions at the 
most basic level. “There is 
only so much about the micro-
scopic nature of dark matter 
that can be observed through 
gravitational interactions,” 
says Geringer-Sameth. “The 
standard model of physics 
explains everything with re-
markable precision, with the 
notable exception of most of 
the matter in the universe.” 
The mystery of dark matter is 
one that stands as a holy grail, 
of sorts — it seems to be the 
only substance that de?es the 
laws of conventional physics. 
By making discoveries such 
as this, physicists come incre-
mentally closer to understand-
ing the entirety of the known 
universe.

Email: it is something 
you use everyday. Marked by 
the well-known “@” symbol 
and sent and received in-
stantaneously, it costs virtu-
ally nothing for a person in 
an apartment in Hong Kong 
to send his best wishes to his 
friend in New York. Email 
may not seem cool in the 
modern world, where it has 
become second nature, but it 
has changed how the world 
communicates since its cre-
ation in 1971. Email is some-
thing that is often misunder-
stood. Behind the scenes, it is 
certainly not as simple as the 
“write, save, send, receive” 
process we know.
Electronic mail, termed 
email, was at ?rst only a mes-
sage that one user sent to 
another on a single machine; 
in the past, a computer used 
to be a giant machine that 
people used dial-up terminals 
to access. It wasn’t until 1971 
that the ?rst modern email 
was sent by a man named Ray 
Tomlinson on the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency 
Network (ARPANET). Tom-
linson’s breakthrough lead to 
the ability to send messages 
to other machine users via 
the Internet by addressing 
the destination using the @ 
symbol, a convention we still 
follow today. Over the past 40 
years, email has evolved just 
like other computer systems: 
It now has sender and receiv-
er information, a subject line, 
a message body, attachments, 
and it enables users to save a 
draft at any time.
To read and write email, of 
course, we need an email cli-
ent, or what we call an email 
“service provider.” Some 
clients are stand-alone, like 
Microsoft Outlook, which is 
offered in Windows OS; other 
common ones, like Hotmail 
and Gmail, are based on web-
pages. But whichever you use, 
the client is the “interface” 
that displays directly to the 
users and allows them to read 
messages in their inbox.
Next, we need a email 
server that the client is con-
nected to. Servers are soft-
ware applications run on 
the Internet, and they listen 
to speci?c ports that people 
and programs will attach to. 
These Internet servers usually 
have a long list of user email 
accounts; for instance, our 
Andrew IDs, which are reg-
istered at domain “andrew.
cmu.edu”. Then, if a person 
wants to send a second per-
son a message, the ?rst per-
son’s email client essentially 
passes to the server the name

of the second person’s ac-
count (name before @), and 
the server will then append 
the message to the text ?le re-
lated to the second user.
That is just a very brief 
introduction to a much more 
complex system. For most 
email users today, the system 
we face is actually made up 
of two different servers run-
ning on a server machine: 
Simple Mail Transfer Proto-
col (SMTP) and Post Of?ce 
Protocol version 3 (POP3). In 
general, the SMTP is like a lo-
cal postal of?ce, which checks 
your postage and address and 
?nally ?nds out where to send 
your mail. 
However, the SMTP can-
not parse a domain name, 
such as cmu.edu, so instead it 
has to contact a Domain Name 
System server (DNS). For in-
stance, the DNS would trans-
late a domain like “cmu.edu” 
to “128.2.42.10”. After the 
SMTP collects all the required 
info, the message from the 
sender will be sent from that 
server to the target domain’s 
mail exchange server, an MTA 
(Mail Transfer Agent). This is 
like the post of?ce of the des-
tination, which will ?gure out 
where exactly to deliver the 
message.
Finally, for the person at 
the other end — the target 
or destination — in order for 
him to fetch the email, he 
must work with a client via 
Post Of?ce Protocol (POP) or 
Internet Mail Access Protocol 
(IMAP). If you actually look 
at your email client settings, 
POP and IMAP are de?nitely 
two popular acronyms. POP, 
just as its name suggests, is 
a server from which you can 
collect the mail others have 
sent to you. In short, POP is 
something that your client 
will reach out to and down-
load the message from to put 
it on your screen. 
But many users demand 
more than that with their 
email. One disadvantage of 
POP is that it is unidirection-
al: Once you download the 
message from the server to 
your computer, it will be stuck 
there. In other words, POP 
makes it quite dif?cult if you 
want to access the same mes-
sage from another machine, 
say your laptop. That is where 
IMAP comes in as a remedy. 
This protocol ensures that 
even after your download, 
your mail stays on the email 
server. 
For example, when you 
check an email from Apple 
on your iPhone, the message 
will be marked as “read” and 
updated on the server. Sub-
sequently, that status will be 
sent back so that all other 
clients are updated, no mat-
ter if you are later accessing 
the email with a laptop or an 
iPad.
Today, different communi-
cation protocols have been de-
signed. While we have talked 
about the most popular and 
widely-used ones, there’s a lot 
more to the email system than 
it seems. For example, some 
users want to send encrypted 
messages. Another example is 
SMTP — although it’s a pow-
erful tool, it has many strict 
requirements and limitations. 
Still, the emergence of 
email has completely revolu-
tionized the way people com-
municate, transcending tradi-
tional physical mail systems. 
As it keeps improving, we will 
inevitably see a better, stron-
ger, and more versatile email 
technology in the future.

Vanuatu deaths raise questions about moral responsibility
KATHRYN MCKEOUGH
Staffwriter
Last week Pam, a category 
?ve cyclone, hit the Paci?c 
islands of Vanuatu. The dev-
astating storm has been re-
ported to have killed at least 
24 people and has left over 
70 percent of the population 
homeless. The Vanuatu presi-
dent and Australia’s Climate 
Council are convinced this was 
not simply a freak storm. Due 
to climate change, the sea lev-
els around Vanuatu have in-
creased by 20 centimeters and 
the temperatures have risen 
slightly. Warmer temperatures 
cause bigger cyclones, and 
higher sea levels mean more 
water can be tossed around by 
the storm. Many attribute this 
storm to the increased carbon 
emissions that caused global 
climate change.
Vanuatu is a tiny, undevel-
oped country. They contribute 
little to carbon emissions and 
other pollution, especially 
compared to countries like 
the United States and China. 
Despite this, the islands of 
Vanuatu and countries like 
them suffer more from climate 
change than large, ?rst world 
power houses do. Should 
more developed countries, 
who contribute the most to 
environmental changes, take 
responsibility for the damage 
they cause to our planet?
The ?rst step is to decide 
who exactly should be held re-
sponsible for climate change. 
The immediate reaction is to 
charge entire countries, yet 
this might not be totally fair. 
There are many groups and 
companies within these large 
countries that make an effort 
to reduce their detrimental 
effects on the environment. 
On the other hand, certain in-
dustrial and government proj-
ects produce a lot of pollution. 
Toyota, for example, admits 
that its hybrid cars require a 
lot of energy and produce a 
lot of carbon emissions dur-
ing production and that the 
lithium ion batteries produce 
an excessive amount of sulfur 
dioxide emissions. Individuals 
can also be responsible for car-
bon emissions. For example, 
air travel uses hundreds of gal-
lons of fossil fuel per person 
per ?ight. Individuals can cer-
tainly be penalized for excess 
pollution or else be required to 
cut back on their carbon foot-
print. This suggests that blam-
ing an entire country might 
not be the most effective way 
to distribute the blame.
Even if we can restrict the 
blame to a speci?c group of 
people today, should they be 
held responsible for the past? 
Two years ago China sur-
passed the United States for 
the ?rst time in the amount 
of carbon emissions they pro-
duce. However, the United 
States has produced more 
total carbon emissions in the 
long run. It is easy to say that 
the United States contributed 
more to climate change, but it 
is dif?cult to make the people 
today pay for what has been 
done in the past.
Some Pugwash members 
stated that the U.S. does hold 
responsibility for its actions 
in the past. The U.S., for ex-
ample, paid reparations to 
Native Americans, a group of 
people severely persecuted in 
the past. Others believed that 
placing the responsibility of 
the past on those today would 
be counterproductive to solv-
ing the problem. Just because 
other countries haven’t had as 
much time to develop as the 
U.S. does not mean that they 
should be excused.
One Pugwash member 
proposed the creation of an 
international committee of 
governments and companies 
to regulate the effect humans 
have on the environment. 
Regulation could include 
taxation on any production 
or shipments that have harm-
ful effects to the environment, 
regulating the amount of car-
bon emissions companies can 
produce and restricting the 
thermostat use of households 
and buildings on a global 
scale. The problem with this 
solution is deciding who will 
be part of this community and 
how they can enforce the legis-
lation. It is extremely dif?cult 
to create an effective interna-
tional society that includes 
members representative of the 
world population, and ensure 
that all people participate and 
abide by the rules it sets.
Finally, Pugwash discussed 
whether every individual felt a 
moral obligation to aid in cli-
mate change. It is dif?cult for 
an individual to hold respon-
sibility for climate change, 
because any positive or nega-
tive action they make will not 
create a tangible impact on 
the environment. However, 
if hundreds or thousands of 
people make the same deci-
sion, the effects will begin to 
become noticeable. Pugwash 
believes that individuals could 
choose to help the environ-
ment if they are educated and 
feel a moral obligation. Unfor-
tunately, only one or neither 
of these conditions is met for 
most people. It appears the 
only solution is to ?nd a way to 
incentivize people to cut back 
on their pollution.
If we continue behaving as 
we do now, life on Earth will 
rapidly become unsustainable. 
Even if we feel no moral obli-
gation to it, changing how hu-
mans live is necessary for our 
own survival. 
Regardless of whether 
or not we are able to decide 
who is responsible, everyone 
should be aware of how their 
actions affect the world.

HOW THINGS WORK
Email aids communication through elaborate system
Pittsburgh Health Data Alliance merges technology and health
Eunice Mok/Junior Artist
development centers funded 
by UPMC with $10 million to 
$20 million per year over the 
next six years. The Center for 
Commercial Applications of 
Healthcare Data (CCA) will 
be based at the University of 
Pittsburgh and lead by Mi-
chael Becich M.D., Ph.D from 
the Department of Biomedi-
cal Informatics. Carnegie 
Mellon will be home to the 
Center for Machine Learning 
and Health led by founding 
director Eric Xing Ph.D, a pro-
fessor of the Machine Learn-
ing Department. Researchers 
from all three institutions will 
collaborate in the two new 
centers forming an ecosystem 
of knowledge and innovation.
Xing envisions the center 
developing technologies that 
will enhance a doctor’s abil-
ity to provide a high quality of 
healthcare. 
“Currently, doctors act as 
the bridge between the pa-
tient and the body of knowl-
edge. The Center wants to 
expand this bridge to become 
more data driven and com-
munity dependent.” Doctors 
will help gather the necessary 
information by asking the 
right questions and can use 
the new tools to aid in their 
decision making.
Innovators like Xing hope 
to ride the wave of wearable 
technologies as a means to 
gather rich and highly dimen-
sional data. He hopes that 
one day we will have a device 
that instantly links patients 
to an ecosystem of doctors; 
a drastic change from the ap-
pointment-based system used 
today.
Carnegie Mellon’s focus 
will largely be in the informa-
tion technology sector, devel-
oping ways to utilize data.  
Xing explained that currently, 
“Medical data has a very short 
life cycle; it is just stored and 
retrieved when necessary. 
The shift towards personal-
ized medicine aims to use the 
data all the time. Your data 
will be used to enhance your 
experience as well provide 
clues about other people’s 
conditions. 
A large patient network 
can be used to make infer-
ences doctors already do, 
but even faster and for larger 
groups of people. The future 
will be to use machine learn-
ing and arti?cial intelligence 
to make decisions. This center 
aims to lay the groundwork to 
develop these new technolo-
gies.”
As professor of machine 
learning, Xing has seen ?rst-
hand the advancements in the 
past decade that now enable 
computers to make inferences 
based on available data. Pre-
viously, computer science has 
primarily been used to de-
velop operating systems and 
store data. “The maturity of 
the discipline has led to suc-
cess in automation such as 
automatic speech translation 
and self-driving cars. Health-
care is ripe to be one of the 
next frontiers of innovation 
because it is high stakes and 
high risk,” Xing said.
Compared with other dis-
ciplines, making the correct 
decisions is extremely impor-
tant because it directly affects 
people’s lives. A decade ago, 
the technology would not 
have been robust enough to 
be trusted to make these criti-
cal decisions.
Xing’s past research in-
volved using machine learn-
ing in a variety of ?elds relat-
ed to medicine. One project 
focused on human genomic 
data by identifying variations 
in DNA that place individuals 
at a high risk for a given dis-
ease. 
So far this approach has 
been done in a weak statisti-
cal fashion unable to accu-
rately identify the interac-
tions between variations. In 
reality it is the combination 
of these variations that is ire-
sponsible for some complex 
diseases. “Using machine 
learning we can build mod-
els using big genome data 
from patient populations and 
moving forward the goal is 
to create a personal model 
for each individual based on 
their genomic artifacts,” Xing 
explained. By using person-
alized genomic data, doc-
tors and researchers can en-
hance and drastically change 
healthcare.
Another relevant project 
in Xing’s repertoire began 
as a computer vision project 
where the goal was to devel-
op an algorithm to automati-
cally detect an interesting 
event in a long video such as 
a surveillance tape. 
After this technology was 
developed, a doctor reached 
out to Xing and explained 
that in the ICU there is a criti-
cal need to monitor patients 
and also hold caregivers ac-
countable. “For example, the 
technology could help ensure 
that the caregiver washes 
their hands thoroughly and 
frequently and can be used to 
protect against malpractice,” 
Xing said.
This center will allow in-
novators to provide doctors 
with their prototypes and 
doctors, in turn, will provide 
feedback to improve the tech-
nology. Both scientists and 
doctors will work to design 
the new technologies. 
Xing praised that the cen-
ter enables interactions and 
collaborations with doctors 
that makes the partnership 
very unique. He noted that 
“the goal of the center is not 
to simply publish a paper or 
make headlines, but to make 
practical products that can 
be adopted by doctors and 
patients for a modernized 
healthcare.”
“Currently, 
doctors act 
as the bridge 
between the 
patient and 
the body of 
knowledge. The 
Center wants 
to expand 
this bridge to 
become more 
data driven 
and community 
dependent.”

On Sunday, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted MOSAIC, its annual confer-
ence on gender. This year, the con-
ference’s theme was Deconstructing 
Gender: Beyond the Binary.
Although the conference focused 
on traditional women’s issues when 
it began in the 1990s, it has rightfully 
grown to address the larger issue of 
gender in response to the campus’s 
growing needs as well as the many 
changes happening in terms of gen-
der and moving past the binary. 
The entire event took place in the 
Jared L. Cohen University Center 
(CUC) with over 150 registered stu-
dents. The program included open 
discussions and presentations led by 
members of the campus community 
as well as guests from all over the 
Pittsburgh community. 
To list just a few, senior drama-
turgy major and dramaturg of Stue-
benville Rachel Abrams discussed 
society’s effects on how we perceive 
sex and sexuality, senior English 
and linguistics major Jasmine Xie 
talked about non-binary individuals 
and their search for inclusion, Carn-
egie Mellon alumnus Harrison Apple 
talked about the Pittsburgh Queer 
History Project, and visiting scholar 
at the University of Pittsburgh Kerry 
J. Kauer talked about heterosexism 
and heteronormativity in women’s 
sports.
In addition to the talks and work-
shops, two exhibits titled A Step: In-
ternational Women Empowerment 
through Digital Photography and New 
Imaginings: Photographic Self-Rep-
resentations of Female Athletes were 
open to conference attendees all day.
In the opening remarks, Coordi-
nator of Gender Programs and Sex-
ual Violence Prevention Jess Klein 
asked attendees to imagine a world 
with no gender. Some proposed that 
there would be no homophobia or 
transphobia, no pink and blue aisles 
in children’s stores, and no wage gap. 
However, others pointed out that 
there would be other issues of inter-
secting identities. Klein agreed, add-
ing that one cultural problem can-
not be eradicated without looking 
others.
It is fantastic to see Carnegie Mel-
lon Student Life taking initiative 
and sponsoring this comprehensive 
event. As Jess Klein pointed out in 
her opening remarks, there is still 
much to do about the issue of gender 
as well as the many other issues as-
sociated with it. 
It will be exciting to see how MO-
SAIC affects the campus community 
and what directions it will take in the 
future. The Tartan hopes that Carne-
gie Mellon will host similar events in 
the future centered on diversity and 
social change.
It is (kind of) spring in Pitts-
burgh, and with the start of a new 
season comes the student govern-
ment elections. The candidates have 
announced themselves and their 
teams, the platforms are in, and as of 
Friday, the debating has been done. 
As exciting as it has been to watch 
democracy in action on our own 
campus, the most thrilling part of the 
process hasn’t started yet.
From Thursday, March 26 at noon 
to Tuesday, March 31 at 6 p.m., both 
graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents will have the chance to cast 
their vote and determine the next 
student body president, vice presi-
dent, vice president for ?nance, vice 
president for organizations, and 
senators.
While some students scoff at the 
idea of spending even a minute of 
their time making their voice heard, 
it is imperative that everyone who is 
eligible to vote do so in this election. 
There are a number of issues at 
stake, and no matter who wins, there 
is much to be done within the next 
year. The university is at an integral 
part of its existence, and the changes 
it undergoes within the next decade 
could very well determine the Carn-
egie Mellon reputation for years to 
come. Students have the potential to 
spark real change at Carnegie Mel-
lon, both on campus and beyond. 
One of the many responsibilities 
that comes with this potential is an 
obligation to vote, and voting when-
ever the opportunity is afforded will 
enable students to better recognize 
the right to vote as a privilege and an 
honor.
The upcoming elections may not 
be of the utmost importance to every-
one this year, but laying the ground-
work for a sustainable democracy 
should be. Last year, the percent-
age of students that voted was 17.9, 
higher than previous years. Turnouts 
this year  again have the potential 
to be much higher, and they should 
be. The Tartan urges students to cast 
their vote this week.

MOSAIC creates colorful, important gender discussion
Voting is right and responsibility for every student
Democratic process should decide shell space use
Last semester, the university be-
gan expanding and improving the 
Jared L. Cohon University Center 
(CUC). The construction will create 
4,559 sq. ft. of empty, unfurnished 
space — “shell space” — on the third 
?oor of the CUC.
The Undergraduate Student Sen-
ate bought 3025 sq. ft. of this shell 
space for $50,000, and the Gradu-
ate Student Assembly (GSA) bought 
1534 sq. ft. Senate plans to use the 
space as a collaborative lounge and 
study place for students, according 
to Senate Chair and junior informa-
tion systems major Evan Wineland.
Senate provided the money par-
tially with their operating budget for 
this ?scal year and partly with the re-
serve account, an account that holds 
rollover money left over after each 
semester.
Senate polled students about the 
shell space as part of their annual 
Senate Week initiative. The survey 
received over a hundred responses 
and asked the question “Which of 
the following aspects of the Carn-
egie Mellon experience are most 
underserved by existing campus fa-
cilities?” The most popular answer 
was “collaborative study,” followed 
closely by “dining.”
Senate took the results of the 
poll and decided to move forward 
with the idea of a lounge and study 
space. Recently, Senate established a 
Shell Space Committee that will de-
termine the speci?c furnishings and 
interior of the yet-unbuilt space.
Although Senate plans to use the 
shell space in way that bene?ts the 
student body at large, the process 
by which they acquired the space is 
questionable. 
The of?ce of the Dean of Student 
Affairs Gina Casalegno and the of?ce 
of the Vice President of Campus Af-
fairs Michael Murphy gave Senate 
and the GSA ?rst priority on bidding 
for the shell space; no other student 
organizations had a chance to bid on 
the space. This method of allocating 
the space, combined with Senate’s 
generous JFC funding, gave student 
government an undue amount of 
in?uence on the construction of the 
expanded CUC.
Senate also spent $50,000 that 
could have been allocated to improve 
the Carnegie Mellon student experi-
ence in other ways. Although they 
polled students on what they would 
like to see the shell space used for, 
Senate did not consider their con-
stituents — undergraduate students 
— when they purchased the space.
The university’s administration, 
rather than furnishing the shell 
space themselves, farmed the task 
out to Student Government in a way 
that neglected the student body’s 
needs and the properly democratic 
process that should be part of the 
university’s dealings.Eunice Oh/Art Editor

I’m never comfortable when I tell 
people that I’m going on a service 
trip. 
There’s no casual way to say that 
I’m spending a week of my time in 
a third-world country, blindly and 
boldly trying to help — whatever 
that means. Some people are bub-
bling with praise, anxious to reas-
sure me that I’m doing good and 
saving the world. Others are not so 
sure. I know why they think this, 
and, in fact, I can’t help but agree 
with them.
Service learning trips, especially 
those associated with churches or 
colleges, are inherently ?awed, and 
it’s hard not to feel like I’m feeding 
into that when I spend a week in 
Haiti. 
From the inside, a trip like that is 
life-changing, impactful, and truly 
invaluable. Visiting overcrowded, 
underfunded schools makes you re-
alize just how lucky you are. Hear-
ing how much people do with so 
little motivates you to try harder to 
make the best of your situation. And 
the connections that you make, both 
with those that you meet and those 
with whom you travel, prove to be 
strong, lasting bonds.
But from the outside, society is 
sometimes skeptical of the true ben-
e?t of these trips. I’ve been asked if 
these trips make me feel superior, if 
I’m giving money to corrupt organi-
zations, and perhaps most insulting 
of all, if I’m just participating in this 
trip for the résumé line.
 Is it really worth it, they won-
der, to send ?fteen students to Haiti 
when instead you could send all the 
money down by itself instead?
In moments of weakness, I ?nd 
myself wondering the same thing. 
It is not, after all, easy to meet with 
people who have millions of dollars 
worth of need, and explain to them 
that we’re here for a week to hand 
out money, or at least as much as 
we have. Here’s $500, hope you can 
make that work, see you next year. It 
makes me feel guilty.
It’s not easy to ride around in 
vans for a week, feeling like every-
one who sees you drive past is won-
dering why you’re here and what 
you’re doing. It makes me feel like I 
am propagating a stereotypical im-
age: idealistic college student who 
thinks that she can change the world 
but only ends up changing her pro-
?le picture, as The Onion cheekily 
wrote.
It’s not easy to return to school 
and be swept up in life here, forget-
ting faces and stories and small trag-
edies that you encountered. It makes 
me feel ungrateful for the experienc-
es and the impacts they made on me.
Service trips are wrought with 
complications. These things aren’t 
easy to do and many of the things 
we see are not easy to witness. But 
no matter how uncomfortable and 
ungrateful I may feel, I will return.
Because along with all of that 
discomfort, there’s a deep feeling 
of ful?llment that lays at the root of 
these trips. Part of the week is ?nd-
ing and recognizing your awkward 
moments, thinking about what 
truth lies within them and how to be 
a different kind of traveler.
You should try to be the kind 
of person that does not advertise 
privilege, the kind that seeks to lis-
ten more than preach, the kind that 
gives respect and attention yet de-
mands nothing in return, the kind 
that spreads a message of hope, 
not help. The kind that only makes 
promises that they can keep. The 
kind that does not trivialize anyone 
or anything. The kind that people 
would want to have come back.
Service trips have the ability to 
change lives, both on the ground 
and in the group. But without hu-
mility, acceptance, and most impor-
tantly of all, respect, the lessons of 
these trips will fall upon deaf ears, 
and the world will continue to ques-
tion the merits of service trips.
Good service trips need 
humility, respectfulness 
“You should try to be the kind of person 
that does not advertise privilege, the 
kind that seeks to listen more than 
preach, the kind that gives respect and 
attention yet demands nothing in return, 
the kind that does not trivialize anyone 
or anything.”

BRANDON SCHMUCK 
Despite the fact that our nation 
continues to move closer to marriage 
equality and increased personal 
freedom, Oklahoma’s House voted 
to pass one of the largest attacks yet 
on the LGBTQ community and non-
religious citizens.
Moving on to the state Senate 
for approval, this bill would restrict 
the performance of marriage cer-
emonies to judges, retired judges, 
and clergy. This would put county 
clerks out of business and make citi-
zens dependent on clergy to perform 
most marriages. Not only is this law 
against the very ideals our nation 
was founded on, but it is a direct at-
tack on individual groups of citizens.
This bill was a last attempt from 
Oklahoma conservatives to keep 
same-sex marriage out of their state. 
The sponsor of the bill, Representa-
tive Todd Russ, even stated that it 
was in response to marriage equality 
laws “stuck down [their] throats” by 
Congress. There is no logical reason 
to restrict marriage to being per-
formed by clergy, and if passed by 
the Senate, the bill is bound to make 
its way to the Supreme Court in no 
time, after the state was already 
forced to allow same-sex marriage 
by the federal government.
The United States was founded 
on the idea of separation of church 
and state. A backer of the bill, Rep-
resentative Dennis Johnson, states 
that, “Marriage was not instituted by 
government.” He is entirely correct. 
However, inheritance laws, tax ben-
e?ts, and other laws dictated by mar-
riage were instituted by the govern-
ment. Giving these bene?ts to only 
those with marriages recognized by 
clergy directly integrates religion 
into the government.
Ideally, no such federal marriage 
regulations would exist. People 
would be free to perform their own 
marriage ceremonies and share 
property and bene?ts with whom-
ever they pleased. However, we do 
not live in this ideal world, and thou-
sands upon thousands of pages of 
laws are dependent on marriage as 
a system of classi?cation. Therefore, 
when clergy give a marriage license, 
they are also giving a voucher to all 
of these government bene?ts.
Despite the fact that this law is 
just utterly ridiculous, it does have 
one pretty great side effect. Ironi-
cally, by passing this law, the conser-
vatives of Oklahoma are indirectly 
legalizing marriage equality in their 
state. In no part does their law men-
tion that same-sex marriage cer-
emonies cannot also be performed 
by clergy. This has caused people to 
jump into becoming registered as 
clergy, which will most likely cause a 
spike in same-sex marriages carried 
out in the state.
It is hard to believe that in 2015 
states are still passing laws that in-
tegrate religion and government 
in ways that our Founding Fathers 
feared greatly. Yes, religion is a very 
important part of our society and, for 
many of us, who we are as people. 
However, when religion is mixed 
with government in a way as hate-
ful as this bill proposes, it defeats the 
reasoning behind religion: to bring 
people together and bring meaning 
to their lives. Government and reli-
gion must remain two distinct and 
separate entities, as beliefs vary by 
person and dictating others based 
on one group’s views is destructive 
to society.
Citizens should be free to hold 
private marriage ceremonies, free of 
government regulation, but should 
not be forced to be a member of a re-
ligious community to get their mar-
riage identi?ed by the state. While in 
the end the ?aws of this bill will sig-
nal a win for marriage equality, the 
ideas from which this bill stemmed 
are backward thinking in nature and 
destructive to the progress of social 
freedom.

Oklahoma marriage law is absurd

I’ll admit it: I stopped watching 
Glee two seasons ago. Granted, I 
stuck around longer than most. The 
show was a revelation at ?rst for an 
awkward teenage musical theatre 
enthusiast, and my initial invest-
ment kept me semi-masochistically 
enduring even as it descended into 
really, truly bad writing. Incidental-
ly, my breaking point was Kurt and 
Blaine’s ?rst breakup (the only char-
acters worth watching by then). I es-
sentially said “screw this bull****” 
and never looked back.
But that’s not exactly true. I ?rst 
looked back when Cory Monteith 
died two summers ago, because he 
was far too young — a celebrity of 
my generation’s invention. I’m also 
looking back now, because Glee 
ended last Friday and I can’t help 
feeling a residual, nostalgic wave of 
sadness.
Glee  was a bad show for a most of 
its run. God knows its creators like 
to think it will go down in television 
history as “The Greatest Show Ever,” 
despite the awful writing, utter ne-
glect for continuity, and self-righ-
teous “issue”-centrism. However, 
now that’s all over, credit should 
be given where credit is due. More 
— and earlier — than any other 
show, Glee demonstrated that diver-
sity in television is both feasible and 
practical.
Justi?ably, Glee took pride in 
playing the diversity card. It ran 
down the checklist of minorities: 
Black, gay, Latino, physically dis-
abled, trans, mixed-race, mentally 
disabled, Asian, bisexual, Jewish, 
and so on. Problematic aspects of 
these characters aside (and there 
were plenty), no other show has 
yet represented minority groups to 
Glee’s extent or prominence.
Anybody who holds a minority 
identity knows that media represen-
tation is an invaluable resource. 
Good, accurate, positive televi-
sion portrayals of minorities are of 
course the ideal, but for the most 
part those are as rare and precious 
as diamonds. Glee may not have of-
fered many diamonds, but it certain-
ly tossed out a whole bunch of cubic 
zirconia. 
For individuals starved for any 
character that validated their iden-
tity, Glee may not have been shiny 
or durable enough, but it was some-
thing. If Glee will be remembered for 
anything, it will be for its diversity.
In this, if nothing else, other 
shows should take Glee as an ex-
ample. Broad media representation 
is doable (Glee did it), and even if it 
by no means signals quality writing, 
good acting, or longevity in a show, 
at least it gives the critics something 
to remember favorably post-cancel-
lation.

Carnegie Mellon’s Diversity Town 
Hall meeting left me disillusioned 
and disheartened.
I love Carnegie Mellon, and over 
the years I have been — and continue 
to be — an ambassador for many of 
its programs, including IMPAQT, Pre-
College, Under Construction, and 
the Washington Semester Program. 
I am grateful and humbled by the 
meaningful relationships and op-
portunities Carnegie Mellon has af-
forded me. They have undoubtedly 
shaped my professional trajectory. 
However, my love for this institution 
is slowly eroding and I am skepti-
cal as to whether Carnegie Mellon’s 
leadership can steer our university 
toward becoming a more inclusive 
institution.
On March 16, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted a Diversity Town Hall as a part 
of the Strategic Plan 2015 initiative. 
Carnegie Mellon’s Strategic Plan is a 
multi-pillar set of goals that creates 
the agenda for both campus initia-
tives and ?nancial support. It was 
painful to sit in a replete, upscale 
Posner Center conference room and 
listen to the dearth of any speci?c 
vision for how to address Carnegie 
Mellon’s lack of diversity in its stu-
dents, faculty, and staff.
At the beginning of the Town Hall, 
administrators made it clear that the 
term “diversity” for their purposes 
is reduced to two categories: ethnic-
ity/race (Black, Hispanic, and Native 
American) and gender. These cat-
egories are areas where institutional 
data is available (they recognized 
that diversity is much more than 
those two categories), but I hope ad-
ministrators will look at other catego-
ries, such as ?rst-generation status, 
moving forward.
Though I appreciate the research 
put into the presentation, as many 
studies of our peer universities such 
as Cornell and the University of 
Michigan were cited, the lack of orig-
inal, innovative solutions to recruit-
ing and retaining diverse students, 
faculty, and staff communicated to 
me that this is only a priority for the 
university on paper. Between 2010 
and 2014, the university increased its 
minority student enrollment by 1.1 
percent. After this Town Hall, I have 
no hope that this ?gure will improve 
much, unless administrators include 
students, faculty, staff, and alumni in 
the conversation.
Throughout the presentation 
there were constant references to 
models our peer institutions have im-
plemented. This approach is perfectly 
valid — why reinvent the wheel, after 
all? However, competitively bench-
marking our practices with those of 
our peer institutions should inspire 
Carnegie Mellon administrators to 
innovate original solutions from an 
informed perspective. Our leaders 
should feel intrinsically motivated 
to re?ect and assess our instition’s 
societal impact. A mind-frame of in-
cessant institutional comparisons is 
detrimental and unproductive for 
Carnegie Mellon leaders to work in.
It begs the question: Why does 
Carnegie Mellon have such an inferi-
ority complex?
Recruitment was one of the topics 
touched upon at the Town Hall. The 
presenter of this topic mentioned 
the best practice is to nurture pipe-
lines for minority students, includ-
ing Carnegie Mellon’s The Summer 
Academy for Mathematics and Sci-
ence (SAMS) and Fusion Forum. 
However, to create robust, non-leaky 
pipelines means they must be well 
funded and well staffed. Our insti-
tution must expand funding for 
such programs and develop new 
ones that enable minority students 
to also explore aspects of Carn-
egie Mellon’s exceptional arts, 
humanities, and social science 
programs.
I would not be on campus 
today if it were not for a Cel-
ebration of Diversity (COD) 
weekend. I was able to connect 
with another ?rst-generation 
Latino student and it made me 
believe I was worthy of enroll-
ing at Carnegie Mellon as well. 
It made me believe this institu-
tion cared about students like 
me.
Yet, funding for initiatives such as 
SAMS has been cut over the last few 
years. There was no mention of this 
in the Town Hall meeting. How can 
Carnegie Mellon brand itself as an 
institution that values diversity when 
it cuts funding to one of its most well-
known diversity programs?
Also, how can this institution de-
cide to move forward in the next ten 
years when there was not a proper 
conversation about how to exactly 
move forward with recruitment? 
Rather than telling the community 
that our diversity programs will be 
evaluated, qualitative and quantita-
tive data should have been presented 
to elicit speci?c feedback from the 
community. Offering this data would 
have made our conversation more 
fruitful as community members 
could also tackle the question: How 
do we matriculate and graduate mi-
nority students on time?
Another disappointing aspect of 
the Town Hall was that ?rst-genera-
tion students — like myself — were 
never mentioned. If Warner Hall does 
not have data on ?rst-generation stu-
dents (which would be surprising), 
then they must begin to collect it so 
they can better talk about socioeco-
nomic diversity and create a support-
ive infrastructure for students. There 
is often an intersectionality between 
being a minority and a ?rst-genera-
tion student that the administration 
must consider when thinking 
about creating 
support 
networks.
Carnegie Mellon’s 
vi-
sion 
is 
to “meet the 
chang-
ing 
needs 
of so-
ciety by 
build-ing on 
its tra-dition 
of inno-vation, 
problem solving, and interdisciplin-
arity.” Carnegie Mellon cannot meet 
the changing needs of our society if 
our institution is not representative 
of the world it wants to mold. First-
generation students are integral to 
this goal because their education 
will potentially have a ripple effect 
not only within their family, but also 
their community.
Administrators should also think 
about creating programs for these 
students to connect with each other, 
as many other universities do. It sad-
dens me that a conversation with 
any member of the administration 
about ?rst-generation students has 
never come up in my time here. This 
is something Carnegie Mellon can 
do better. Looking back, much of the 
anxiety and self-consciousness I felt 
during my time at Carnegie Mellon 
was related to my ?rst-generation 
status.
Throughout the Town Hall there 
was mention 
of “uncon-
scious 
bias” in 
the hir-
ing and 
re-
cruit-
ment pro-
cess. They 
pro-
posed 
sen-
si-
tivity 
training as a 
way to mitigate 
this. When profes-
sors and staff have 
to undergo cultural 
professional develop-
ment, however, it is some-
thing they tend to not take se-
riously. Being sensitive to cultural 
difference and aware of your cultural 
biases can only stem from years of 
conversation and critical thinking. 
Rather than use sensitivity training 
to make administrators feel like they 
are making our institution a more 
global place, what if we recruited 
staff and faculty who value, respect, 
and embody what we want our insti-
tution to become?
Perhaps even more importantly, 
what if minorities occupied decision-

certainly tossed out 
a whole bunch of

individuals starved 
for any character 
that validated 
their identity, Glee 
may not have been 
shiny or durable 
enough, but it was 
something. If it will 
be remembered for 
anything, it will be 
for its diversity.”

Borland retirement highlights dangers, culture shift in NFL
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
Safety concerns have been 
plaguing the National Football 
League (NFL) in recent years, 
but it seems like more play-
ers than ever are voicing their 
concerns in the form of early 
retirements.
The average length of an 
NFL career, currently 3.3 
years, has always been fairly 
low. For every superstar we 
get to see on the ?eld, dozens 
of players cannot get playing 
time, resulting in early retire-
ments. On the other hand, 
those players that do make it 
onto starting rosters and be-
come important contributors 
to their teams often enjoy ca-
reers lasting into their thirties 
and sometimes even forties, 
barring any career-ending 
injuries.
Over the past few weeks, 
however, there have been 
many prominent names in 
the NFL retiring early. Jason 
Worilds, a top linebacker for 
the Pittsburgh Steelers, re-
tired last week, calling it quits 
at 27. Jake Locker, the former 
starting quarterback for the 
Tennessee Titans, retired ear-
lier this month at 26. The San 
Francisco 49ers lost 30-year-
old linebacker Patrick Willis, 
who many thought would still 
be contributing to the team for 
years to come.
The most jarring of these 
early retirements, however, is 
former 49ers linebacker Chris 
Borland. Borland had only just 
completed a great rookie sea-
son for the team, impressing 
the 49ers enough to consider 
him the future for the fran-
chise, especially after Willis 
decided to hang up the cleats. 
Borland speci?cally cited con-
cerns about the risk of brain 
injuries, having nursed a con-
cussion he sustained during 
training camp. “I just thought 
to myself, ‘What am I doing? 
Is this how I’m going to live 
my adult life, banging my 
head, especially with what I’ve 
learned and knew about the 
dangers?’” Borland said Mon-
day on ESPN’s “Outside the 
Lines.”
Injury concerns in the NFL 
are nothing new. The NFL has 
been saying that “football has 
never been safer,” and to a 
large extent, that is true. Bet-
ter protective equipment has 
made an impact on reducing 
the occurrence and severity of 
injuries. Better medical prac-
tices have limited the duration 
and long-term damage of in-
dividual injuries. In addition, 
the league has been employ-
ing many different initiatives 
over the past years to attempt 
to make the game safer, in-
cluding an onslaught of new 
penalties for “unnecessary 
roughness,” limiting the 
amount of contact practices 
teams hold during the course 
of the year, and a concussion 
protocol instituted in 2013 
intended to minimize the ef-
fects of concussions through a 
variety of steps taken before a 
concussed player can return to 
play.
What separates these con-
cerns over player safety from 
past challenges to the NFL 
is the new culture emerging 
from both NFL players and 
NFL fans. On comment boards 
surrounding Borland’s deci-
sion, many have applauded 
him for making a move that 
sacri?ces the fame and glory 
he could have gotten in the 
NFL in order to preserve his 
quality of life. Many current 
players like St. Louis Rams 
guard Chris Long and former 
players like former New Or-
leans Saints and Cleveland 
Browns linebacker Scott Fujita 
are also lauding him, rather 
than the traditional response 
to injury concerns, which is 
questioning his toughness.
Chris Nowinski, an expert 
on sports-related concussions, 
suggested that a signi?cant 
culture change is taking place 
in the NFL right now. On Bor-
land’s decision to walk away 
from football, Nowinski said, 
“It shows the macho culture 
of ‘destroy yourself for the 
game’ is losing its grip, that 
it’s no longer cool to question 
people’s toughness. That rep-
resents a big shift in thinking 
from just a few years ago.”
More players are making 
the choice to value their long-
term health over the millions 
of dollars they can get play-
ing in the NFL. This is not to 
say that football is becoming 
more dangerous than it ever 
has been. Quite the contrary: 
Safety has de?nitely become 
concerning to the NFL, and 
their efforts to improve the 
game and spread awareness 
about the risks of football are 
leading those who are wary on 
the risks of playing the game 
to exit the spotlight with con-
siderable dignity. The changes 
in the NFL also do not com-
pletely ensure a safe game.
Barring any rule changes 
that will forbid tackling, there 
will always be some risk of in-
jury playing football, but the 
safety measures in play now 
and in development will mini-
mize the frequency and seri-
ousness of these risks.
The NFL will not run itself 
out of business through con-
tinuing to improve safety mea-
sures; instead, it will be able 
to maintain the entertainment 
value football has and ensure 
that its key contributors do not 
suffer long-term consequenc-
es as a result of playing in the 
NFL.
SPORTS BRIEFS
Swimming and Diving
Starting on Wednesday, se-
lect members of the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving team 
competed in the NCAA Divi-
sion III Championships in 
Shenandoah, Texas. On the 
opening day, the women’s 
200-yard medley relay team, 
comprised of junior Kira 
Singhaus, ?rst year Kimberly 
Hochstedler, and sophomores 
Gillian Crews and Allison Kirk-
by, placed 14th during prelims 
with a time of 1:45.51, but 
DQ’d during the ?nals.
The men’s 200-yard relay 
team, with senior Josh Lu-
cheon, sophomore Sivan Meh-
ta, and ?rst-years Matthew 
Chu and Kevin Steinhouse, 
also competed and ?nished 
13th overall by setting a new 
school record with a time of 
1:30.64, earning them All-
American honorable mention.
Steinhouse and Crews each 
competed individually in the 
50-yard freestyle, with Crews 
?nishing 40th with a time of 
24.50 and Steinhouse ending 
up in 48th in the men’s with a 
time of 21.29.
On Thursday, the women’s 
relay team competed again, 
this time ?nishing 13th overall 
in the 400-yard medley with a

All-American Honorable Men-
tion. Crews competed in her 
second of 3 individual events, 
with the 100-yard butter?y, 
?nishing 18th with a time of 
56.57.
Friday saw strong individ-
ual performances by several 
Tartans with Chu competing 
in the 100-yard breaststroke, 
touching the wall with a time 
of 56.77 for 27th, Crew in the 
200-yard butter?y, ?nishing in 
a time of 2:07.47 for 27th and 
Hochstedler competing in the 
100-yard breaststroke and ?n-
ishing with a time of 1:07.12, 
good for 32nd. Sophomore

The championships mark 
the end of the swimming and 
diving season.
Track and Field
On Friday and Saturday, 
both Carnegie Mellon track 
and ?eld teams competed in 
the Washington and Lee Track 
and Field Carnival.
The women started with 
senior Sasha Spalding setting 
a new school record in the 
200-meter dash with a time of 
25.73, good for a second place 
?nish. In the 10000-meter run, 
a pair of Tartans took 2nd and 
3rd place as juniors Zo?a Till-
man and Sophie Lohmann ?n-
ished with times of 38:42.36 
and 39:12.51 respectively.
In the ?eld events, sopho-
more Rebecca Fortner took 
?rst place in the high jump 
by clearing the 1.51-meter 
bar on her ?rst attempt, while 
fellow sophomore Grace Yee 
took fourth in the pole vault 
by clearing the 2.86 mark. 
Junior Lauren Mature placed 
fourth in the shot put with a 
10.07-meter heave, her high-
est ?nish of her three throw-
ing events.
For the men, the top per-
former was senior George 
Degen, who set the event 
record in the 10,000-meter 
run with a time of 30:51.98. 
He ?nished ?rst with fellow 
senior Joe Pane ?nishing in 
third with a time of 32:07.86. 
In the 800-meter run, sopho-
more Owen Norley took the 
top spot with his career best 
time of 1:53.62. To round out 
the track success, sophomore 
Curtis Watro placed second in 
the 3000-meter steeplechase 
with a time of 9:49.24.
In the ?eld events, the only 
success came from ?rst-year 
Kevin Wainczak, who tied for 
fourth in the pole vault by 
clearing the 3.96-meter bar, 
and ?rst-year Jacob Schofel, 
who placed 5th in the ham-
mer and 6th in the discus with 
tosses of 41.58m and 36.46m, 
respectively.
Both squads will next com-
pete in the Carnegie Mellon 
Mini-Invite on Saturday.

March Madness de?es 
prediction. Every year, mil-
lions of Americans, from of-
?ce pools across the country 
to President Obama ?ll out 
brackets and within a few 
hours most are so laughably 
wrong that Warren Buffett 
was willing to wager a billion 
dollars of his own money that 
no one would be unscathed at 
the end of the tournament in 
April.
Needless to say Buffet is 
still very much a billionaire 
and in hundreds of of?ce 
pools the die-hard college 
basketball fans are bemoan-
ing how the person who 
picked based on uniform col-
ors beat them.
This year was no differ-
ent with the ?rst three games 
showing three of the 3 seeds 
taken to the buzzer by their 
mid major 14 seed counter-
parts. Notre Dame barely 
made it out alive by forcing a 
last second turnover against 
Northeastern, but Baylor and 
Iowa State were not as lucky, 
losing to Georgia State and 
UAB respectively.
The Georgia State squad 
barely won its conference 
tournament and had a coach 
celebrating so hard he tore his 
Achilles, leading to the comi-
cal moment of him falling 
off his stool when his son hit 
the game winning shot. UAB 
athletics has been struggling 
so badly they just disbanded 
the football team due to lack 
of funds. These are the stories 
of the giant killers who felled 
two of the top teams from 
a Big 12 Conference so tal-
ented that 70 percent of the 
conference made it in to the 
tournament.
The ?rst day had ?ve 
games decided by a single 
point and two go into over-
time, but the second day was 
nearly as bizarre because of 
the lack of upsets and close 
games. The iconic 5–12 up-
set never happened and the 
tournament shockingly went 
almost as predicted with only 
11 seed Dayton’s win over 6 
seed Providence to close out 
the day not going as expected.
No one expects “chalk” 
or all of the favorites to win, 
but to have two days so dia-
metrically opposed was 
strange even by tournament 
standard. This weekend, the 
tournament still couldn’t de-
cide what its identity should 
be with 1 seed Villanova los-
ing to 8 seed North Carolina 
St. and 7 seed Michigan St. 
knocking off 2 seed Virginia 
to leave the Eastern Regional 
without its top two seeds, but 
everything else was shock-
ingly expected with Kentucky 
continuing its dominating un-
defeated season by blowing 
out Cincinnati and Arizona 
crushing Ohio State.
In a year where almost ev-
eryone has Kentucky winning 
it all, and anyone picking oth-
erwise just praying for an up-
set to win some money, March 
Madness is still struggling 
to ?nd its identity. It could 
be the year of the Cinderella 
story or that of the dominant 
top seeds imposing their will 
on the competition.
There are still two more 
weekends to go, and really all 
anyone knows is that there is 
bound to be some entertain-
ing basketball. That and the 
fact that everyone’s brackets 
are likely more valuable as 
?re kindling than any chance 
at making money in your 
pool.

Carnegie Mellon teams continue seasons through break
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
Men’s Tennis
Over the break, the Carn-
egie Mellon men’s tennis team 
traveled to Claremont, Califor-
nia for its annual spring break 
tour. The Tartans faced off 
against some of the best teams 
in the country, including top-
ranked Trinity University, 15th 
ranked Pomona-Pitzer Colleg-
es, and 18th ranked Bowdoin 
College.
The ?rst day for the Carn-
egie Mellon was a double–
header with Pomona-Pitzer 
in the morning and University 
Athletic Association (UAA) ri-
val the University of Rochester 
in the evening.
The Tartans fell behind 
quickly against Pomona-Pitzer 
after going 1–2 in the doubles 
matches with only seniors 
Will Duncan and Christian 
Heaney-Secord pulling out a 
close victory, 9–8. In singles 
play, Carnegie Mellon played 
close with all but two matches 
requiring a tiebreaker either 
for a game or the set. Junior 
Abhishek Alla won 7–6 (7–4), 
6–4, while sophomores Kunal 
Wadwani and Kiril Kirkov won 
their respective matches 7–5, 
6–0 and 6–4, 7–6 (10–8). The 
split in singles play was not 
enough to overcome the early 
hole from doubles and left 
Carnegie Mellon losing 5–4.
In the next game against 
Rochester, the Tartans took 
out their frustration from the 
morning with a 9–0 victory. 
While every player won their 
matches, senior Bryce Beiss-
wanger and junior Yuvraj Ku-
mar were dominant in dou-
bles play with a 8–2 victory 
and Alla, Heaney-Secord and 
Wadwani were outstanding in 
singles play with all three win-
ning in straight blow out sets.
Next up for the Tartans was 
Bowdoin College, where Carn-
egie Mellon started off slow 
by dropping all three close 
doubles matches. The Tartans 
rebounded in singles play 
with Heaney-Secord and Wad-
wani each winning in straight 
sets, 7–5, 6–0 and 7–5, 6–4 
and Kirkov pulling out a tight 
match 7–6 (7–3), 1–6, 1–0 
(10–3). The singles split was 
again unable to pull Carnegie 
Mellon out of their early dou-
bles hole as they fell 6–3.
After the disheartening 
defeat, the Tartans had to 
pull it together as they faced 
off against the top ranked 
team in the country in Trinity 
University. Carnegie Mellon 
trailed again after doubles 
play with only Duncan and He-
aney-Secord winning, 8–2, but 
this time the Tartans singles 
play was enough to overcome 
the de?cit. Alla and Kirkov 
won in straight sets, 6–3, 6–1 
and 6–3, 6–0 respectively, 
while Heaney–Secord and 
Duncan both earned their sec-
ond wins that day, 6–3, 3–6, 
7–5 and 6–7 (1–7), 6–0, 7–5 
respectively.
To ?nish off the trip, Carn-
egie Mellon faced off against 
Sewanee and blew them out 
9–0. All three doubles teams 
won by at least 5 while all 6 
singles matches for the Tar-
tans were straight set victories 
as the Tartans ?nished the trip 
with a vengeance.
Women’s Tennis
During their annual spring 
break trip to California, the 
7th ranked Carnegie Mellon 
women’s tennis team com-
peted against the top teams in 
Division III.
First up for the Tartans was 
UAA rival Rochester. Carn-
egie Mellon disposed of them 
quickly in a 9–0 victory. Senior 
Bryn Rachke and ?rst-year 
Cori Sidell won their doubles 
match 8–0 while all six singles 
matches were won in blow out 
straight set victories.
The next match was a bit 
tougher when Carnegie Mel-
lon faced off against 5th-
ranked Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps. The Tartans dropped 
all three doubles matches to 
fall behind quickly before con-
tinuing to struggle in singles 
play with only junior Brooke 
Tsu and Raschke pulling out 
victories, 6–2, 6–1, and 6–4, 
2–6, 1–0 (10–5).
Trying to rebound, the Tar-
tans next faced 8th-ranked Po-
mona-Pitzer. Carnegie Mellon 
fell behind earlier with only 
sophomores Vanessa Pavia 
and Stacy Chang pulling out 
a win, 8–3. The Tartans ral-
lied back in singles play with 
Pavia, sophomore Nicholle 
Torres, Tsu, and Raschke all 
pulling out victories to give 
the Tartans the win, 5–4.
Rounding out the trip, 
Carnegie Mellon faced off 
against 14th-ranked Sewanee. 
Two doubles wins by Pavia and 
Chang along with Tsu and Tor-
res put the Tartans in the early 
lead before Pavia, Torres, and 
Raschke all won in straight 
sets, 6–3, 6–2; 6–3, 7–5; and 
6–1, 6–1; respectively, and Tsu 
won with a come-from-behind 
victory 4–6, 6–1, 6–4.
Men’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon Men’s 
golf team competed in two 
tournaments over the break, 
the UAA Championships and 
the Jekyll Island Invitational.
In the UAA Champion-
ships, the Tartans kept it close 
all weekend. After the ?rst 
day, Carnegie Mellon shot a 
313 and was only down two 
strokes from leader Rochester 
and sophomore George Qian 
was ?rst among individuals 
while senior Cameron Low 
was tied for 6th. On day two, 
the Tartans shot much bet-
ter and posted a 303, which 
jumped them into second 
place with a 616 for the tour-
nament. Qian was tied for ?rst 
with his second 74-shot round 
and won the ?rst playoff hole 
to claim sole posession of ?rst 
place. Sophomore Alexander 
Pomerantz played as an indi-
vidual and was third overall 
and claimed ?rst team all-UAA 
honors with Qian.
In the Jekyll Island Colle-
giate tournament, the Tartans 
faced off against 30 teams 
in the 54-hole tournament. 
On the ?rst day, the Tartans 
shot a 302 and Qian led Carn-
egie Mellon with a 73, good 
enough for 22nd out of 150. 
Senior Justin Fischler and Low 
both shot 76s on the day. Day 
two was a bit tougher for the 
Tartans; they shot a 311 while 
Low and Qian both shot 75s.
The ?nal day for the Tar-
tans was led by sophomore 
Jordan Klodowski, who shot 
6 birdies as Carnegie Mellon 
shot a 300. Qian and Low each 
shot a 75 again with Qian ?n-
ishing tied for 37th overall. 
The Tartans ?nished the tour-
nament tied for 21st.
Women’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s golf team competed in the 
?rst ever UAA women’s golf 
championships. 
This is one of many ?rsts 
for the Tartans, who are still 
in the midst of their ?rst year 
of varsity competition. On the 
?rst day, the Tartans shot a 
388 to place them in a distant 
third.
The brightest spot was 
?rst-year Summer Kitahara, 
who was tied for 5th with her 
80 for the round. Day two was 
much better with Carnegie 
Mellon improving by over 25 
strokes to shoot a 362. Kitaha-
ra earned all-UAA ?rst team 
honors with her 161 shot tour-
nament, good enough for 5th 
overall.
The Tartans also competed 
in the Jekyll Island Invitation-
al over the long break, ?nish-
ing tied for 13th with a 1032 
round total (346–354–332). 
Kitahara had the best overall 
?nish for the Tartans with a 
three day total of 242, which 
placed her 24th overall. Fel-
low ?rst-year Robin Tan place 
27th overall with her 54 hole 
total of 244, which was bol-
stered by her career-low 76 on 
the ?nal day.
Track & Field
Select members of the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s track and ?eld teams 
traveled to compete in the 
NCAA Indoor Championships 
over break. For the women, 
senior Erin Kiekhaefer com-
peted in mile run. She posted a 
5:03.96 in prelims to move on 
to the ?nals before her 5:09.32 
time placed her ninth overall.
For the men, seniors Thom-
as Vandenberg and George 
Degen both competed. Van-
denberg competed in the 400 
and 800 meters. Times of 
49.05 in the 400 and 1:53.43 
in the 800 pushed him to the 
?nals in both events. In the ?-
nals, Vandenberg ?nshed 5th 
in both events with a time of 
49.13 in the 400 and 1:54.98 
in the 800, giving him two All-
American honors. Degen ran 
the ?nals of the 3000 meter 
and ?nished 10th with a time 
of 8:28.49.

Club lacrosse puts NCLL on notice with big win in ?rst-ever game
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
The ?rst day of spring may 
have brought yet another 
batch of snow to Pittsburgh, 
but it also signaled the start 
of the season for the Carnegie 
Mellon Club Lacrosse team. 
Opening against the Waynes-
burg Yellow Jackets, the Tar-
tans turned a chilly night into 
a red-hot rally of scores, domi-
nating Waynesburg 9–5.
Carnegie Mellon got off to 
an early lead when senior mid-
?elder Esteban Pacheco scored 
the ?rst goal for the Tartans, 
sneaking it through a narrow 
gap on the left side of the goal. 
Waynesburg answered with a 
strike of its own, and the game 
began to settle into a defensive 
battle with a lengthy succes-
sion of saves by both goalies. 
Towards the end of the ?rst 
quarter, the Tartans were able 
to earn another score, making 
it 2–1.
The next quarter brought 
more offensive action to the 
game, starting with an early 
score by Pacheco. The Yellow 
Jackets scored again shortly 
afterwards, but sophomore 
attacker William Tyler Reid 
answered with a score of his 
own. Tensions rose among 
the visiting players, as evi-
denced by one member of the 
team slamming his helmet to 
the ground after the referees 
pulled him out for commit-
ting a penalty. Waynesburg 
took a more aggressive ap-
proach toward the end of the 
second quarter, sending shot 
after shot at junior goalie Brad 
Hodge until ?nally manag-
ing to score. Their elation was 
short lived, as the Tartans led 
by Reid quickly answered, tak-
ing a 5–3 lead into halftime.
From that point on, the 
Tartans began to overwhelm 
the Yellow Jackets. After a suc-
cession of blocks by Hodge, 
the Tartans quickly turned to 
the offensive, leading to an-
other Pacheco score. While 
Waynesburg tried to muster 
a response, the Tartans coun-
teracted each Waynesburg 
attempt to advance the ball, 
eventually turning the tables 
with another score, this time 
courtesy of graduate student 
mid?elder Travis Armiger. Be-
fore they realized it, the Yel-
low Jackets found themselves 
surrendering another score to 
Reid, bringing the game to a 
lopsided 8–3 score. Although 
Waynesburg would manage 
to add two more goals to their 
total in the fourth quarter, 
the Tartans’ lead was just too 
much, especially with yet an-
other score from Reid by the 
time the game ?nally ended.
Sophomore long stick mid-
?elder, defender, and captain 
Kincaid Murray was elated 
with the team’s performance, 
especially considering the lim-
ited time the team has actually 
been able to meet for practices. 
“We’ve only been able to really 
have two practices due to the 
snow,” Murray said, citing the 
large amount of snowfall that 
has blanketed Pittsburgh often 
this year. “As a result, we were 
a little sloppy.”
Nevertheless, the team’s 
dominating performance 
was very satisfying. “It was a 
great start to our season,” he 
said. “We will be very good 
going forward.” The club 
team switched over this year 
from the MCLA (Men’s Col-
lege Lacrosse Association) to 
the NCLL (National College 
Lacrosse League), which has 
most of their opponents locat-
ed nearby and a better chance 
for the team to compete.
Murray believes that the 
team chemistry is very strong 
among both the coaching staff 
and the players. “We’re all out 
here for the love of the game,” 
he said. “It’s a fast paced and 
physical sport that really 
draws people in and has a tight 
knit community.” Making the 
time to come together for the 
sport, especially with the rig-
ors of Carnegie Mellon, makes 
the feats they achieve on the 
?eld even more impressive, al-
though Murrary contends that 
their love of the game makes 
balance easier to achieve. As 
the team goes though more 
games together, their chem-
istry will almost certainly im-
prove. Judging by the strength 
of their start, it will certainly 
be exciting to follow the team 
going forward.
George Qian shakes pressure, takes UAA championship
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
With a day remaining in 
the two-day University Ath-
letic Association (UAA) Men’s 
Golf Championship, sopho-
more George Qian led by a 
single stroke. The thinnest of 
margins separated him and 
the competition, but Qian had 
been in this position before, 
and was able to fend off the 
mounting pressure. Despite 
letting the lead slip by the elev-
enth hole, Qian was able to 
recover and tie the clubhouse 
lead going into the ?nal hole. 
Qian needed a par or a birdy to 
keep his chances alive. Despite 
missing the green with his 
second shot, an excellent chip 
shot set up an eight foot putt 
to tie up the competition. Qian 
sunk it, setting up a playoff.
The playoff was over 
quickly. After Qian’s opponent 
missed the green on his sec-
ond shot Qian “just aimed for 
the middle of the green.” He 
hit his mark, setting up a two-
putt, which Qian described as 
his favorite situation.
Qian was able to draw on 
recent experience to help him 
through the nail biter of a ?n-
ish. He said sinking the putt 
to force the playoff was “like 
a ?ashback” to the end of his 
competition at the amateur 
tournament in his native Iowa, 
where he dropped a playoff 
after two holes and ended up 
runner up. The familiarity of 
the situation helped the Bet-
tendorf native ease his nerves. 
Qian, self-described as com-
petitive and calm, backed up 
his claim and sank the sec-
ond putt to lock down a UAA 
title, the ?rst for a Tartan since 
2009. 
His triumph at the confer-
ence tournament added to his 
growing trophy case, which 
already included a spot on the 
Golf Coaches Association Na-
tional All Freshman team last 
year.
Qian’s dedication to golf 
has been a lifelong endeavor. 
He started at the age of nine, 
around the same time his par-
ents — his father is his caddy 
at amateur tournaments 
— and some of his friends 
started playing. He started to 
play competitively in middle 
school. He says the challenge 
and the impossibility of per-
fection draw him to the game; 
there’s always room to im-
prove. Spending two to three 
days a week on the golf course 
and spending plenty of time in 
the offseason in the simulator 
in Skibo Gym helps him do just 
that on a regular basis.
It should come as no shock, 
then, that Qian has little inter-
est in benchmarks and puts a 
lot of emphasis on improving 
his best performance. While 
he said many people talked 
about 77 as a bad day, he ?nds 
it to be an arbitrary tick mark. 
He said the number did not 
matter so much as how well 
someone played. He prefers 
more concrete numbers such 
as 67, his personal low score 
for a tournament.
In addition to the limit-
less potential to for a golfer to 
grow, Qian also touted the in-
dividuality of the sport. While 
he admires the work ethic 
of extraordinarily successful 
golfers such as Tiger Woods 
and currently top ranked Rory 
McIlroy, there is no one he 
tries to emulate, preferring to 
forge his own style. He says 
golf is about creating your own 
game and “sticking with what 
works.” A conference title as a 
sophomore seems to indicate 
that he’s on the right track. He 
attended a golf academy in his 
?nal two years of high school 
and even has his sights set on 
going pro. Qian wants to start 
out in Asia and play some mini 
tours in pursuit of breaking 
into professional golf after 
he graduates from Carnegie 
Mellon.
Despite his future plans, 
academics come ?rst for the 
?nance major. He followed 
his brother’s lead into ?nance, 
thinking he would prefer it to 
his parents’ profession, engi-
neering. After starting out in 
the Tepper School of Business, 
Qian found that he particular-
ly enjoys quantitative classes, 
such as multivariate analysis. 
He is also pursuing a com-
puter science minor — 15-110 
and 15-112 were his favorite 
classes in the semesters that 
he took them. Balancing the 
combined workload, however, 
is not a problem. His years at 
the golf academy taught him 
to balance golf and academic 
work, giving him the ability to 
excel at both.
Including a cascade of top-
10 ?nishes and a conference 
championship, Qian’s success 
on the golf course is indisput-
able. Even so, with a third of 
this season left, Qian is not 
even close to done with the 
front nine of his already illus-
trious Carnegie Mellon career. 
The best is almost certainly yet 
to come.

Haiti trip refreshes, inspires
Stepping away from CMU highlights what truly matters
From the moment I stepped out of the airport into the 
breathtaking heat and oppressive smells of Haiti, I 
realized that it had been exactly one year since I had 
been truly uncomfortable — and I had missed that 
feeling. This year was the second time I had been to 
Haiti, and the country had just as much of an impact on 
me as it did the first time that I laid eyes upon its crystal 
blue waters, far-reaching dust, and stacks of houses.
Living in the Carnegie Mellon bubble isn’t fulfilling, I 
remembered. Traveling to a foreign country, another 
world, so close yet so distanced, is. Seeing how 
determined the citizens of Haiti are to realize their 
dreams of living in a better world reminds you that you 
can make an impact.
If a woman who is married to an abusive, unemployed 
man and has three children and one on the way can get 
a loan of $64 and change her life, what’s your excuse?
It’s hard to find the words to sum up all that I witnessed 
and experienced in the packed, weeklong adventure, but 
it all boils down to a lesson about culture.
For a country that has somehow sustained itself through 
natural disasters, human disasters, deadly diseases, and 
abuse from neighboring empires, Haiti and the people 
who live there remain mysteriously optimistic.
They refuse, proudly, any help or the slightest suggestion 
of giving up. When we visited the internally displaced 
persons camp and asked how we could help, we were 
met with proud, blank stares.
“We don’t want your money. We want your support. 
We want you to use your influence and your position to 
spread our story and make people remember us,” the 
director of the camp said.
They don’t want visitors to walk around and only see 
the remnants of buildings that crumbled in 2010, when 
the earthquake struck. They want you to walk around 
and notice the people who quietly go about every day, 
making small but powerful strides toward a better life for 
themselves and their children.
They want you to notice the small urban garden 
experiment on top of the hill and the cramped, hot tent 
next to it where hundreds of people stop by to pick up 
plastic baggies filled with pills, hopefully enough to 
sustain them until the next clinic opens.
They want you to see the children dancing and realize 
that they live in Cité Soleil, where gangs once ruled and 
thousands live in poverty.
They want you to walk into the orphanage that they run 
and be touched by the fact that it’s run not as a corrupt 
business, but as a family household where everyone is 
sister and brother.
They want you to hear the history of the country and 
realize that not only were they the first independent 
black nation to revolt, but that they’ve been suffering 
from the remnants of imperialism ever since.
They want you to look past the homes made of wooden 
stakes and tarps that have a faded USAID logo on it and 
see the people that live in them; the people who, if they 
had the same opportunities as you and I, would be the 
world’s next star soccer player, the next Monet, the next 
Einstein.
It’s hard, though. For years, we’ve been bombarded with 
photos and stories from on-the-ground reporters who see 
only the evil and the hopelessness. Our hostess, Rea Dol, 
who is so incredible she deserves an article of her own, 
aptly summed Haiti up: “If you just listened to what you 
heard on TV and the radio, why would you ever come 
to Haiti? You must see it yourself to know that Haiti has 
hope.”
Not everyone will go to Haiti. Not everyone will see what 
we saw in these past two years and be moved to action. 
But everyone should know of the hope that exists there 
and feel it themselves. Because the most important thing 
that I learned in Haiti is that no matter what nature, 
dictators, doctors, or police throw at you, if you’re 
breathing at the end of the day, you’re lucky to be where 
you are. And from there, it’s your duty to put yourself 
into making life better for yourself and those around you.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I don’t get out much, but when I do, I’m always 
way too concerned with being the first person 
there. Especially when we go out to bars! 
I went and saw this show for which my 
dramaturgy friend did whatever it is they do, and 
the plan for afterward was to go to The Yard with 
a bunch of people to celebrate. I waited until my 
friend left to walk over to Walnut Street, but when 
I got there, no one was there yet, and I panicked. 
I ended up hiding in some bushes across the 
street until everyone else showed up, rather than 
wait alone at the bar. 
What can I do to start being ok with being first to 
a party?
Best,
Failing Incessantly to Reach Seat at The Inn 
Subsequent To Huddle of Ever-Weary Others, 
Really Starting to get Ticked
Dear FIRST IS THE WORST,
I don’t know if hiding in bushes across from a bar 
(and next to a shadier bar) late at night is the best 
thing you could have done. I’m not worried about 
you getting robbed — I’m worried about you scaring 
the crap out of some drunk guys that see a pair of 
eyes staring out of the bushes. Plus, if someone had 
to throw up, I’d imagine those bushes would be at 
the top of a short list of places to do that.
I recommend you consult your home copy of 
Magical Drafts and Potions for a concoction that 
might fit the bill, maybe one that can help boost self-
confidence in uncomfortable settings. If you don’t 
happen to have the book, you can borrow it from 
m… my roommate. Yeah.
If you’d rather not go through the trouble — making 
potions is difficult, not to mention demoralizing — 
then I would pregame so heavily that you’ll only care 
about showing up early if you remember the night at 
all. This is assuming, of course, that you won’t just 
decide to get drunk at home and watch Parks and 
Recreation, which is certainly a viable option.
If you don’t want to go changin’, then I suggest 
incessantly texting your friends once you get to the 
venue, urging them to hurry up. Let’s face it: You’re 
not early — they’re always late.
But really, those bushes must be disgusting,
Evan Kahn

I do not exaggerate when I say that everyone needs to see 
Steubenville. Even though the School of Drama’s debut 
production of this play — conceived, directed, and written by 
drama masters students — closed this weekend, I have high 
hopes that Steubenville won’t end here. Not only is it a good 
show, but, more than that, it’s an important one.
The show dramatizes events surrounding the real-life 2012 
sexual assault of a high school girl (referred to throughout 
as “Jane Doe” or “redacted”) in the small, sports-heavy Ohio 
town of Steubenville. Jane Doe was blackout drunk at a party 
when 16-year-old football players Ma’lik Richmond and Trent 
Mays repeatedly raped her. They proceeded to share texts, 
videos, and photos of the incident on various social media 
before Jane Doe herself was aware of what had happened.
The Steubenville case made headlines nationally for months. 
So, many of you may be familiar with it and as skeptical as I 
was that a show centered on such a sensitive subject could 
be at once tasteful and effective. My nervousness abated 
a good deal when I started worrying about actually being 
able to snag a ticket, considering all performances sold out 
within an hour of the box of?ce opening. Little did I know, 
Steubenville would completely obliterate all of my half-formed 
expectations.
On a technical level, the show was among the most 
complicated I have seen. My gaze was immediately drawn to 
the several television screens directed toward the audience, 
the onstage camera on its tripod, and the three microphone 
stands in a line — each of which would play an integral 
part in the narrative. The multimedia integrated seamlessly 
throughout is all too appropriate, considering the extent to 
which the Steubenville case was de?ned by news coverage 
and social media.
To this end, heartbreaking text messages between Jane Doe 
and the perpetrators are displayed in real-time, and the actors 
assume the roles of television news reporters, re-enacting 
real commentary on the case. The audience is caught up in 
a ?urry of victim-blaming, misogyny, and ridiculousness; it 
comes to a head when two male Fox News reporters gang 
up on a female correspondent, insisting that rapists are a 
distant, irreformable subcategory of men that women should 
defend themselves against with ?rearms. The choice to 
have technicians operate onstage heighten the intimacy 
and immediacy that the script already impresses upon the 
audience.
In its execution, Steubenville is no less than groundbreaking 
— a feat for which master’s student in directing Eleanor 
Bishop should take due credit. The “meat” of the show is the 
trial transcript, read in segments into the microphones with 
minimal vocal in?ection. The clinical text is colored, however, 
by the actors tossing, crumbling, and otherwise letting each 
page fall from their hands after it is read. At particularly 
meaningful lines, they look straight ahead — giving the 
audience a moment to judge for themselves — and they 
take a synchronized deep breath. Before long, the audience 
appears to fall into rhythm and begins breathing along 
with them. Where the transcript was especially painful, the 
communal breathing was a comfort.
Equally fascinating is the play’s “Sleeping Beauty” element, 
which serves as an allegory for the Steubenville case and 
rape culture in general. The show opens with a lighthearted 
parody of the classic Disney love song (“One day soon, I’ll 
?nd my true love,” etc.). But what starts out as comic relief 
steadily descends into eeriness as it becomes clear the 
extent to which toxic ideas about love and sex are deeply 
entrenched in our society. Even our hallmarks of childhood 
have been marked with the belief that when the maiden says 
“no,” she must be chased, and when the maiden is sleeping, 
she can still be kissed.
Also contributing to Steubenville’s uniqueness are 
interwoven interviews with a diverse group of female 
students on love, sex, and feminism. As silent videos of the 
interviews play for the audience, the actors serve as the 
women’s voices — mimicking everything from their accents 
to their facial expressions. Questions such as “Did you have 
a sexual awakening?” add a fun voyeuristic element to the 
show; “Do you ever feel objecti?ed?” had every woman in the 
audience nodding along; and “What would you say to Jane 
Doe?” gave me goose bumps.
While junior acting majors Zach Fifer and Colin Whitney 
make vital contributions to a brilliant ensemble performance, 
junior acting major Molly Griggs should especially be 
applauded. Griggs’s solo Beyoncé dance number could have 
been comical or just bizarre, but her barefaced commitment 
to it really made me believe it was her own personal source 
of empowerment. I couldn’t help but feel empowered along 
with her. At one point, Griggs breaks out of the dispassionate 
trial readings and assumes the role of Jane Doe. Voice 
breaking, she asks a witness to the crime — someone she 
once trusted — why he did nothing to stop it. The distinctive 
sounds of snif?ing sounded throughout the audience.
One of the most admirable things about Steubenville is the 
obvious respect its creators have for Jane Doe. Her rape is 
never depicted on stage, and the more explicit and gratuitous 
parts of the trial are purposefully excluded. Trigger warnings 
adorn every piece of the play’s marketing campaign. Its 
brochure is thoroughly educational, featuring information 
and insight on Carnegie Mellon’s own “battle against sexual 
assault.” Far from exploiting Jane Doe’s trauma, Steubenville 
alone among heaps of media coverage seems to listen to 
Jane Doe’s voice, not to mention the millions of women like 
her.
“I want people to walk away with a more open mind,” 
said Fifer, adding that plenty of people who think they’re 
supporting women contribute to a toxic culture without 
knowing it. “I am part of the culture.... I can help with this, 
but I can also make it worse.” Fifer wants every woman 
watching Steubenville to feel “supported and not alone.”
The reason why I wish everyone could see Steubenville is 
that there is so much to learn from it, especially in a society 
where feminism is often a bad word and convicted rapists 
can be back on their football teams within two years. 
Steubenville’s message — beautifully and innovatively 
expressed — is more potent now than ever.

A television program is only as good as its series ?nale.

where the show is going and what is driving it. Season 
?nales are meant to be incomplete, with little character 
development and a whole lot of buildup; the central idea 
of these episodes is to leave the viewers wanting for more. 
However, the ?nal episode of a series is ?nal — it should 
leave viewers ful?lled and characters suf?ciently developed 
so as to have some form of closure.
A very small amount of TV shows have been able to 
pull off seamless series ?nales that have truly delivered 
everything they needed to. Scrubs, Friends, How I Met Your 
Mother, Desperate Housewives, and Parks & Recreation all 
understood that in order to truly deliver a series ?nale, there 
must be some dwelling on the past and some looking into 
the future, and   , most important of all, closing complicated 
plot points. 
This week a show both beloved and hated by many ended 
on Friday night. Glee has had a lot of ups and downs these 
past six years. The ?nale was divided into two parts, both 
of which were well executed. The show’s creators decided 
to format the ?rst episode of the ?nale like they did the ?rst 
season: with grit, passion, and extremely ?awed characters. 
The second part was truer to the current development of 
the program and had everything we have come to expect 
from the show: big numbers, big characters, and big 
emotionally driven moments.
The ?rst episode of the series ?nale provided a very 
important feature for the entire series: It gave background 
for the characters, ensuring that viewers developed a 
sense of just how far the characters have come. The most 
important part of the episode was the one that focused on 
Finn Hudson, the character played by Cory Monteith, who 
died in 2013. This episode was not about new songs, new 
characters, new problems, or what will happen, rather, it 
was made to redirect our attention to the beginning, to the 
times when the characters were driven by very different 
objectives and when the future seemed most bleak. The 
second episode of the two-hour ?nale, titled “Dreams Come 
True,” gave every character his or her happy ending. While 
that may seem like naïve writing, it holds true to the show’s 
history. Viewers have to remember that the show is called 
Glee; it is about joy, about ?nding your way in life. Each 
character was given enough time to say their goodbyes 
and take their ?nal bows. Some of these happy endings 
seemed far-fetched — especially Sue Sylvester’s (Jane 
Lynch) — however, others were extremely appropriate and 
showcased the importance of this show in pop culture.
Glee has impacted pop culture in many ways. It currently 
holds the record for most charted songs by an artist in the 
Billboard Hot 100 as of 2013. The show’s focus on music 
has helped bring musical theater to younger audiences that 
might not have the chance to experience it. It also made 
an effort to promote the arts in school. During its run, the 
show covered almost every single musical style and most of 
the biggest names in music, as well as some more obscure 
songs. 
The ?nale’s music had some high notes and some off-
key moments. Certain songs did not ?t the characters or 
the moment they were living, such as “Someday We’ll 
Be Together” by Diana Ross and The Supremes, and 
could have been replaced with more tender ballads that 
enhanced the sweet moments shared by the cast. That 
being said, the ?nal song, “I Lived” by One Republic, 
perfectly encompassed the meaning of the show and the 
show’s purpose while showcasing the cast’s immense 
talent.
Finally, the show remained true to its origins by going to 
four of Mr. Schuester’s (Matthew Morrison), the original 
club director, lessons. In a ?ashback, we see Lillian Adler 
(the coach that inspired Mr. Schuester) telling her students 
that “Glee is about opening yourself up to joy”; in another 
?ashback Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) says that “when we 
look back on our time here, we should be proud for what 
we did and who we included.” In the scenes set in the 
future, Rachel shows growth; she used to say that being 
a part of something special makes you special. Now, she 
said, “being a part of something special does not make 
you special. Something is special because you are a part of 
it.” Finally, in one of the closing scenes, Sue Sylvester said 
that she is proud of what the Glee club taught everyone 
that passed through it and that her experiences with them 
changed her for the better. She goes on to say that the club 
“sees the world not as it is, but as it should be,” and that it 
is one of the bravest things people can do. After her speech, 
the club performed for the last time, reuniting all of the 
voices that had gone through the club for one last moment 
gave one of the most tender moments in the entire tenure 
of the show. This ?nale was not perfect, and the middle 
was somewhat off, but it showcased how the show lived: 
starting strong, struggling through, and ending somehow 
stronger.

Before starting Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, I was 
ready to jump on another comedy show. Each time I 
opened Net?ix over break, the front page screamed at 
me with the show’s aggressively bright promo, tagged 
with the line “Created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock.” 
I suppose that’s what got me to watch the show in the 
?rst place — Tina freaking Fey, star of 30 Rock and 
cast member and writer for Saturday Night Live. It was 
going to be amazing.
But then I actually watched it. For background, the 
show follows Kimmy Schmidt, one of the “Indiana Mole 
Women,” a group of women who were kept locked 
in a bunker by a cult leader. The women are rescued 
one day, a bystander’s testimony gets auto-tuned 
and goes viral, and the women become celebrities 
in their hometown and across America. Deprived of 
her formative teen years, Kimmy decides to stay in 
New York on a whim, fending for herself with little 
knowledge of current culture.
Only one season is available on Net?ix right now with 
a total of 13 episodes less than half an hour each. I 
breezed through it within a day (which says a lot about 
my binge-watching habits, I guess), and while there 
were some laughs here and there, my reaction for most 
of the season was basically, “Haha! ... what?”
While the show has numerous funny moments and 
one-liners, there are other situations and setups that 
are borderline insensitive. I say borderline because, 
to be honest, I’m not sure whether they cross the line 
into offensive territory, even if the show’s writers tried 
to make light of murkier topics. The fact that the show 
pokes fun at women who were kidnapped and detained 
for 15 years and forced to believe that the world had 
ended by a charismatic cult leader is pretty dark (the 
situation is vaguely reminiscent of the Ariel Castro 
kidnappings that made national headlines back in 
2013).
The show also sometimes successfully and comedically 
addresses race issues, but other times doesn’t. 
Kimmy’s best friend Titus, a gay black man who’s 
trying to make it in New York’s show business, gets 
harassed by a construction worker and notes, “Oh, I’m 
not even gonna know which box to check on the hate 
crime form.” I laughed a lot at Titus’s remarks, and 
his weird, random music video “Pinot Noir.” Titus is 
unapologetically funny, and is quick to call out others 
on wrongdoing. When the women who were kidnapped 
are discovered, a news screen can be seen with large, 
bold words “white women found” at the bottom of the 
screen, followed by a much smaller line of text reading 
“Hispanic woman also found,” referring to Donna Marie 
Nuñez (played by Sol Miranda). On the other hand, 
another character, Jacqueline Voorhees (played by 
Jane Krakowski) hides her Native American heritage 
by dying her hair blond and wearing blue contacts. 
While this pokes some fun at white privilege, since 
Jacqueline actively seeks to live a wealthy lifestyle in 
New York, the fact that the actress who plays her is 
blatantly white doesn’t make each scene with her any 
less awkward. In the season ?nale, Jacqueline attacks 
a marching band mascot after realizing she can’t hide 
from her past. She crushes the head of the costume — 
a Native American head — and proceeds to howl to 
the sky. It’s a bizarre situation, and ultimately a bizarre, 
distastefully done subplot.
That being said, the cast actors embody each character 
so well that I couldn’t imagine anyone else playing 
their parts. Ellie Kemper (from The Of?ce) plays the 
naive and overly excited Kimmy Schmidt effortlessly. 
Tituss Burgess (Titus) and Jane Krakowski (Jacqueline) 
depict a level of shallowness and self-absorption that 
only they could pull off. And of course, Jon Hamm plays 
the gorgeous and frustratingly charismatic cult leader 
Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has received an 
overwhelmingly positive response from critics and 
audience members alike, but it has some unforgivable 
shortcomings. The show still has a lot of potential, and 
I hope that it improves in its second season so that 
viewers don’t have to think, “Is it okay to laugh at this?” 
throughout each episode.

Gender roles often have disastrous consequences for 
people who struggle to ?ll their assigned stereotype. Last 
Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon had a special showing of a new 
?lm, The Mask You Live In, that focuses on how society’s 
narrow de?nition of masculinity can cause more harm than 
good.
The documentary was written, directed,  and produced by 
Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who performed the same roles in 
the creation of the popular ?lm Miss Representation. Where 
Miss Representation examines the feminine stereotype, The 
Mask You Live In takes a similar look at how masculinity is 
constructed. Newsom partially funded the ?lm on Kickstarter, 
where she raised over $100,000.
The movie surveyed a wide array of the troubles faced 
by boys and men as they try to navigate the realm of 
masculinity. A common theme was the command “be a 
man” and the cultural baggage that comes with living up 
to that ideal. To “be a man” means to not cry, to not be 
sensitive, to not let people mess with you, to respond with 
violence, to be angry, to drink, to womanize.
The ?lm included interviews with a wide variety of 
individuals, both male and female, as well as clips of 
conversations men have with each other about masculinity. 
One of the more jarring and interesting clips included in 
the ?lm was the conversation between a discussion leader 
and a group of inmates. Each of the incarcerated men 
ruminated on how their perceptions of being male or feelings 
of emasculation may have contributed to their criminal 
activity. One man confessed that he thought what had 
brought him to kill another human was partially the feeling of 
powerlessness and feeling beholden to another person.
There was also a strong emphasis throughout the movie on 
the relationship between fathers and sons, and the kind of 
parenting behavior that might exacerbate negative societal 
expectations for men and boys. Numerous men throughout 
the ?lm discussed how their relationship with their fathers or 
the absence of their fathers, has affected their feelings of self-
worth. In one heartwarming scene, a man talked about how 
his son had explained to his father that he was a sensitive 
boy, and that raising him as a single father since then has 
caused him to get him more into contact with his own 
feelings. Every week they put notes or letters to each other 
in a box and then read them on Sundays. The notes often 
contain feelings, thoughts, and demonstrations of affection.
Filmmakers punctuated moving interviews and powerful 
footage with statistics, and the statistics were frightening. 
Adolescent boys are more likely to drop out of school, be 
expelled, or even commit suicide than their female peers. 
Experts in psychology and sociology used these statistics 
as a jumping off point to discuss substance abuse and 
depression among teenage boys, and how acting out is 
often not taken seriously. Instead of delving into the reasons, 
thoughts, and feelings behind a young man’s actions, often 
parents and community members simply write them off as 
“a bad kid.” The ?lm emphasized the need to look beyond 
bad behavior for root causes and ways of solving a national 
epidemic of underachieving boys.
Toward the middle of the movie, they showed a group of 
middle school boys working with a mentor to help break out 
of the “masculine” mask. They each had sheets of paper, 
and they were supposed to represent the inside and the 
outside of themselves. On one side they wrote the faces they 
present each day: happy, silly, fun, tough. When coming in 
and sitting down, and writing on the paper, the kids were all 
joking around and messing with each other and laughing.
It wasn’t until they threw their papers into the middle and 
picked up someone else’s, and read the opposite side: angry, 
sad, hurt. Then it grew quiet. They started leaning back 
in the chairs, or folding up inward on themselves. Some of 
them put arms around each other. “That’s not a coincidence 
that all of you wrote something like pain or sadness on that 
paper,” the teacher said.
This moment really struck me, because it just ?t with 
my middle school — and onward — experience. It’s not 
ordinarily okay for guys to open up and have “weak” 
emotions or to be vulnerable. They have to ?t into either the 
“strong and silent” stereotype or the “man-child” who never 
grows up. Neither one has room for close bonds and shared 
emotion. I felt tears, and wondered if this was the time for me 
to leave the room, as we were told in the beginning that it 
was okay to do. Then I realized that I shouldn’t be ashamed 
of crying.

I never knew how much I liked traveling on my own until 
I did it for the first time. It’s like the opposite of losing my 
virginity; before I went to Dublin I had all these fears that 
it was going to be horrible and I’d have a miserable, boring 
time. But then it happened, and it was actually a wonder-
fully stimulating experience that I didn’t want to end. It 
was a bit messy, though, thanks to Arthur Guinness.
There’s nothing quite like the sense of adventure that 
comes from slinging a backpack over your shoulder and 
boarding a budget airline flight to an unknown city. No real 
plan, no concrete idea of how I’m going to make it to the 
hostel, just trust in myself that I’m capable of making it all 
up as I go along.
Without having another set of tastes and interests to 
entertain, I can treat a city as my personal playground. I 
can wander the streets, peeping in to various stores and 
attractions, staying at each as long as I want. It was this 
aimlessness that led me to such treasures as the Irish 
National Gallery, the Musee de l’Orangerie and its fantas-
tic room of Monet’s massive water lilies canvases, and an 
absinthe shop. I never thought it was possible for such a 
small amount of liquid to get me that buzzed for that long; 
I wasn’t fully right until three metro rides and a twenty 
minute walk back to the hostel.
This “rule of one,” that is when you travel by yourself, can 
only be fully proved by its opposite. I have taken trips with 
other people, and it was an enjoyable experience. It was 
nice to have company; people to share jokes, meals, and 
experiences with. I can assure you that the days definitely 
went by faster with others, and there were certainly more 
pictures (I loathe the idea of selfies, and the more people 
I meet the more alone I feel in this destination). But there 
were sacrifices, like being shaken out of a sleep and into 
a dreadful hangover at 9 a.m. to go tour the Edinburgh 
Castle. How anyone can drift into a peaceful sleep at a 
hostel is beyond me; the bunk beds are rocks that squeak 
with each breath you take, there’s always at least one 
person snoring like a freight train, and countless other 
unexplained noises that last all night. Somehow, though, 
this guy could do it, and I resented him the whole day for 
it. Democratic processes meant every decision needed to 
be debated endlessly until two members of the group sur-
rendered that “they didn’t care, whatever you want to do.” 
There was an extended period of time spent searching for 
little bells in gift shops.
Traveling with others also means you meet fewer people. In 
the traveler’s bar in Paris I would spend every night with a 
great group of people, like Clinton the hilarious Australian 
and the ever-smiling Rodrigo, the Brazilian who kept me 
stocked with cigarettes the entire stay. There was also the 
kind group of Italians who passed around free shots like 
they were sticks of gum at a rave. Granted, traveling with 
others is just generally a safer experience; there was noth-
ing resembling wandering around unfamiliar Manchester 
streets choked thick with fog at 1 a.m., searching for a 
place to sleep and having a group of drunk men in track 
suits standing outside a shady strip club start screaming at 
you in Polish and following you down the street. That kind 
of stuff only happens when you’re by yourself, and I’ll likely 
remember that moment until dementia snatches it up.
In a few days I’ll be boarding a flight to spend two weeks in 
other places I’ve never been where they speak languages 
I haven’t the faintest knowledge of. I will get lost. I will 
struggle to understand what exactly is being offered on 
a menu. People on the street will harass me for money 
because my dress and wide-eyes are a dead giveaway that 
I’m American. I will love every minute of it.

Tales from Abroad: traveling by yourself
Experiencing foreign cities and people on your own leads to unique and varied talesTales from Abroad: the charm of Granada
Studying overseas in smaller cities gives students an opportunity for understanding
Odds are, you haven’t heard of the city I’m studying abroad 
in this semester. It’s called Granada, and it is in the south of 
Spain. It’s a city, but a small one, with a population of around 
240,000 people. (Pittsburgh, for context, has a population 
of around 300,000.) Despite Granada’s lack of international 
prominence, it’s an absolutely fantastic place to spend a 
semester.
To start with, I should probably explain how I chose to spend 
five months living here. I’m not gonna lie, I kind of picked it 
at random. I’d heard of the city, through a class I took on pre-
modern Spanish history in my freshman year. Most of what I 
remembered about it predated 1492, which was shockingly 
not that relevant to life in Granada today. But when I was 
looking over lists of cities in Spain that I could study in, I 
remembered the name and said, “Hey, that looks cool.”
Lucky for me, Granada is a really awesome place to spend 
five months of your life. One of the things I love most about 
the city is how small it is. I feel like I can experience and 
engage with the city’s character in a way that wouldn’t 
be possible in a larger city. I’ve visited both Madrid and 
Barcelona since coming here. I liked Madrid well enough, 
but didn’t really have a good sense of the city’s unique 
style. Spending time there just felt like being in any other 
enormous international city. I adored Barcelona, and I felt 
that it definitely had a much more unique culture, what 
with the city’s clear division between Gothic and Modernist 
architecture and its fascinating history. But even loving 
Barcelona as I did, I was a little overwhelmed by the sheer 
size of the city. Over 1.6 million people live within 40 square 
miles. I was only there for a few days, it’s true, but I think 
that the city is so massive that engaging with it in a mean-
ingful way would be proved difficult for me, even with five 
months to explore. (Plus, Barcelona is far more expensive 
than a city like Granada, so even if I was there for five 
months, I would most definitely be broke by the end of it.)
Speaking of ways that Granada is particularly wallet-friend-
ly, the city is one of the few places left in Spain that still 
offers free tapas with every round of drinks you order. Tapas, 
which are basically small snacks served in bars, can range 
from delicious to disappointing, given that in most places, 
you can’t actually pick what they give you. But given that 
the vast majority of tapas that I’ve had here have been some 
variant on bread and cheese and some kind of pork product, 
it’s hard to go wrong.
But the thing I’ve been enjoying most here is meeting and 
getting to know new people. Granada is a college town. 
The Universidad de Granada, which was founded in 1531, 
is one of the largest universities in Spain, with 60,000 stu-
dents. There’s also a large international student program. To 
receive a degree from the university, students have to pass a 
foreign language test, and many of them pick English. This 
all amounts to there being a large population of people who 
are friendly and eager to practice their language skills. The 
Centro de Lenguas Modernas hosts intercambio events (lit-
erally, “exchange”) in which students can get together and 
practice, usually their English or their Spanish, respectively, 
but German and French come up, too.
The people at the intercambios tend to be really interest-
ing; I’ve had some of the most striking conversations from 
my time here in Spain at those types of events. Just last 
week, I spent over an hour talking with a physics major from 
outside of Granada about what it was like for him to grow 
up in a country that was a dictatorship until the late 1970s. 
Talking to him made me feel how much I take for granted, 
having grown up in a system that’s been a representative 
democracy for so long. While United States politics are far 
from perfect, we don’t have the widespread cultural distrust 
of government that exists here in Spain.
Granada isn’t a big metropolitan center, and it’s not exactly 
a player on the international stage. But for the last three 
months, I’ve really been enjoying my time here, and am 
looking forward to the next two months before I head back 
to the U.S.

10greek sing
pillbox 03.23.15
As a non-Greek af?liated student who had never seen 
Greek Sing before, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect 
Saturday night. As I walked up to the Soldiers and Sailors 
Memorial Hall, I was surprised to see the performers outside 
taking photos in costume. The excitement was already 
high. The performers themselves ?lled up most of the ?rst-
level seating in their elaborate costumes and makeup.
The show began with an impressive, fast-paced step 
performance by Lambda Phi Epsilon. The remaining 
numbers were split into doubles (a fraternity-sorority 
pair) and singles (one fraternity or sorority). Some groups 
chose to parse together songs and dialogue from a movie 
or musical, while others rewrote the story into a college 
setting. One group wrote an original musical. Almost all 
the groups used a live band, which I found particularly 
impressive.
In the singles category, Alpha Epsilon Pi took ?rst place 
with their hilarious Spamalot, put in the context of 
fraternity brothers on a Monty Python-style adventure to 
White Castle. The original musical’s “You won’t succeed on 
Broadway [if you don’t have any Jews]” was a particular hit. 
The production was also littered with kosher jokes and jabs 
at other fraternities, like Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s cardboard 
cutout costumes. The win was thoroughly deserved — it 
was the wittiest originally rewritten piece of the night.
The second place prize in singles went to Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon for their original musical, Grocery Story. The 
fraternity used its signature painted cardboard costumes 
with short jean shorts. It opened with a Romeo and Juliet-
inspired monologue and progressed to a feud between 
health foods and junk food at a local Giant Eagle. The hero, 
a Hot Pocket, had one of the best voices of the night. The 
show included an impressive selection of foods in costume, 
and small details like health food yoga sessions were 
especially funny. The foods resolved their differences when 
they discovered that healthy items taste better combined 
with junk food, like Twinkies and tofu. Both bizarre and 
funny, SAE deserved its second-place win with this piece.
Alpha Phi received third place for their rendition of Mean 
Girls, which also included a song from Legally Blonde and a 
plot referencing The Hunger Games, closing with a Taylor 
Swift song. The story was more far-reaching across genres 
and source material, so Alpha Phi was able to vary the 
dialogue and make the piece more original. I appreciated 
that Trang Pak was the only girl to emerge from the arena 
alive.
Though they did not place, Sigma Tau Gamma’s Avenue 
Q was funny and relevant to Carnegie Mellon, with songs 
about pining for college days and overcoming everyday 
stress. It was endearing, but fewer audience members 
were familiar with this musical and may have found it 
jarring (one song is titled “Everyone’s a little bit racist,” and 
Gary Coleman makes regular appearances). The rewritten 
sections were witty and the song selection was well done. 
They deserved more laughs than they got.
The other singles performances were School of Rock by 
Sigma Nu, about an underdog team competing for glory, 
and Star Trek by Delta Upsilon, about the crew of the 
Starship Enterprise. Both of these included impressive 
dance breaks and had quite a bit of original dialogue.
The doubles performances tended to stick to source 
material more closely, but the performances were just as 
impressive. The Lion King by Kappa Kappa Gamma and 
Phi Delta Theta included very impressive giraffe costumes, 
beautiful group dance choreography, and a clever transition 
from young Simba to his adult form (switching the actor’s 
race and gender).
Aladdin by alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Sigma Chi was a 
whirlwind of colorful, beautiful costumes and impressive 
group dancing. The set was particularly impressive, and 
the writing included a nice balance of Carnegie Mellon 
jokes. I would have liked to see this piece place in the ?nal 
judging.
Pitch Perfect by Delta Gamma and Pi Kappa Alpha had 
the most original writing of the doubles shows, including 
fun jokes about “the other CMU” (it took place at Central 
Michigan University). I wish they had used more a cappella 
singing, but their live band was especially enthusiastic.
The winners in the doubles category were Thoroughly 
Modern Millie, Wicked, and Seussical the Musical, taking 
third, second, and ?rst place respectively. All three shows 
were impressive.
Thoroughly Modern Millie was charming, as done by Alpha 
Chi Omega and Kappa Sigma. The soloist as Millie stood out 
especially. The group tap number was dazzling. This group 
may have had the highest all-around production value of the 
night, with their 1920s costumes and sparkling set.
Delta Delta Delta and Delta Tau Delta teamed up for 
Wicked, which showed incredible vocal power. The soloist 
on “defying gravity” won over the crowd, but I was also 
impressed by their use of ensemble voices to elevate the 
group songs.
The doubles winners, Kappa Alpha Theta and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, deserved their victory with Seussical the Musical. 
The group pieces were stunning and the solo voices were 
perfectly suited to their roles. The costumes and set were 
fanciful. Some of my favorite touches included Horton 
the Elephant in an argyle sweater and the Cat in the Hat 
making faces and strange reactions in the background of 
each scene.
At the end of the evening, everyone was reminded why 
Greek Sing happens at all. As a philanthropy event, Greek 
Sing raised over $86,000 this year. A representative from 
Our Clubhouse, a cancer support organization, gave a 
volunteering award to Delta Gamma sorority. Shraddha 
Joshi, a postdoctoral fellow in Mechanical Engineering, 
spoke about her experience surviving leukemia and how 
Our Clubhouse helped her. She brought the audience to a 
standing ovation. It was satisfying to know that the people 
around me, still in makeup and costumes, were just as 
enthusiastic about supporting Our Clubhouse as they were 
about the competition.
