Locks replaced in Mudge
Thief gets away with master key, cash
By TONY BRUSSEAU
Tartan Staffwriter
A master key to Mudge House, 
left unattended at the dormitory’s 
front desk, was stolen Thursday. 
The theft resulted in the loss of 
cash and laundry tokens valued 
at $232.25, and the Housing Of­
fice was forced to replace every 
lock in the building.
Junior Darlene Fozard said she 
had to leave her Thursday desk 
shift early. She asked the desk at­
tendant from the previous shift, 
who would return the cash box to 
the Housing Office, to return the 
key ring along with the box.
Fozard left the keys in the 
Mudge Service Desk for the at­
tendant. The attendant forgot to 
pickup the key s,which were taken 
while the desk was unattended 
between 1:30 and 4:30 pm.
At 11 pm Thursday, Amy 
Ginther, assistant director of
"Since the theft seems not to be a 
‘prank,' I have no other choice but to 
replace all locks in Mudge.”
— Housing Director Anthony Martin
housing for residence life, called 
security to open the storage closet 
to retrieve the cash box. The con­
tents of the box were missing.
Ginther immediately notified 
Mudge RAs that an unauthorized 
person had a master key.
On Friday afternoon, theHous- 
ing Office and Campus Police 
posted notices around the build­
ing informing residents that a 
master key had been stolen. Se­
curity was increased in Mudge 
until all locks were replaced.
“Since the theft of the key ring 
seems not to be a ‘prank’ by a 
resident who doesn’t mean to
cause any harm, I have no other 
choice but to replace all locks in 
Mudge House as quickly as pos­
sible. This will involve not only a 
very large expense on the part of 
the Housing Office but also a 
certain amount of inconvenience 
on the part of Mudge residents,” 
wrote Director of Housing An­
thony Martin in a memo posted to 
residents.
Friday the locksmith began 
devising a new key system for 
Mudge. Saturday morning he 
began rekeying doors one floor at 
atime. The process was completed 
Sunday.

CRY OUT! protests 
alleged police 
harassment of 
gays on Dithridge
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan Assistant News Editor 
& JONATHAN LEVY 
Tartan Contributing Editor
Members of CRY OUT!, a local 
gay andlesbian rights activist group, 
claim that gays and lesbians are 
being harassed by Pittsburgh Po­
lice.
The accusation is underscored by 
CRY OUT!’s charges that the Sep­
tember 10 murder of David Piergal- 
ski in Schenely Park was an inci­
dent of gay-bashing directly related 
to this alleged harassment. CRY 
OUT! members have charged that 
Pierglaski was forced to leave 
Dithridge Street by Pittsburgh Po­
lice on the evening he was killed.
The group staged a candlelight 
protest in the Dithridge Street area 
last Saturday. The area between 
South Dithridge Street and South 
Craig Street is known as a gay cruis­
ing area.
In a statement released at the 
protest, David Stewart, a CRY OUT!
member, said that 
“homophobia killed 
David Piergalski.
He was killed be­
cause he was gay.
Homophobia is thé 
reasonpolice harass 
us here.”
Police claim that 
they are responding 
to residents’ com­
plaints of illicit ac­
tivity in the area.
Last Wednesday, The Pittsburgh 
Press reported that Pittsburgh Police 
Assistant Chief of Operations Donald 
Aubrecht said local residents and 
businesses complain of people com­
mitting acts of lewdness in the area. 
Those residents feel that they are 
harassed by gays cruising there.
Marshall Goodwin, a resident of 
the area, wants the area restricted to

Space Allocation 
Board to review 
Hamerschlag 20 
cluster closing
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Administration officials feel it is “unlikely” that Carne­
gie Mellon’s Space Allocation Board will reverse a recent 
decision to close a computer cluster located in Hamersch­
lag Hall and turn the space over to the Department of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering.
However, President Richard Cyert has agreed to reo­
pen the issue at the next meeting of the Space Allocation 
Board, allowing Academic Computing officials time to 
prepare a brief on the cluster’s use.
Located in room 20 of Hamerschlag Hall, the cluster: is 
at the center of a controversy begun last week after 
Academic Computing officials said they were not con­
sulted in the SAB decision to close it.
“What we’re going to do is take another look at that 
whole decision,” said Cyert. “We’ll get some more infor­
mation. We were told that the cluster was not being used 
very intensively, and I think that’s true.
“I think the Board was taking the word of some faculty 
members and department heads on the usage, and I’ve 
since had it verified by one of the [student] consultants.”
Officials on both sides of the issue said they didn’t 
believe the reexamination would change the Board's 
decision.
“I think they’ll end up with the same conclusion,” said 
Vice President for Academic Services William Arms. 
“They said they were going to find another space [for;the

CMU Design team travels to USSR for Design USA exhibition
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Staffwriter
A group from the CMU design 
faculty have traveled to the So­
viet Union to lead Design USA, a 
program sponsored by the U.S. 
Information Agency (USIA).
This first group of four faculty 
members left for Moscow last 
Friday. They will return next 
Friday, with the promise of an­
other group being sent in Novem- 
ber, and possibly one more in 
February.
The faculty currently in the 
Soviet Union include Dan Droz,
“It’s exciting to think that the fences 
can come down ... sharing resources, 
ideas, and opportunities."
— Design Department Head 
Carroll Gantz
an adjunct faculty member in 
design; Joe Ballay, professor in 
the CMU design department; 
Georgette Demes, associate di­
rector in engineering design; and 
Gerald Proctor, vice president of
a local design firm.
The Design USA exhibition will 
travel to nine Soviet cities over a 
period of 19 months. An expected 
two million Soviet citizens will 
visit the exhibition. This is the
second major cultural exchange 
between the U.S. and Soviet 
Union produced by the USIA.
According to Richard Cleary, 
an architectural historian in­
volved in the program, the impor­
tance of this program can be 
measured by its timing as well as 
its content. “In the midst of 
glasnost and perestroika, the U. S. 
faces the possibility of opening an 
entirely new trade frontier. De­
sign USA is a demonstration of 
what American technology in 
design has produced in terms of 
goods and services for its people.”
The CMU faculty members will
spend one week in Moscow. The 
team will lead a three-day semi­
nar and spend the rest of the time 
meeting with its Soviet counter­
parts. The seminar will highlight 
the leading edge in design meth­
ods of architecture, desktop pub­
lishing, and industrial and 
graphic design.
Todd Cavalier, a teacher in the 
CMU design department, will be 
one of the four who will attend the 
November seminar in Leningrad. 
Beyond taking the opportunity to 
visit the country of his ancestors, 
Cavalier feels that as a scholar,

H&SS may offer monitor trade-in to encourage Mac II systems
By DANIEL DEGRANDPRE
Tartan Staffwriter
H&SS is encouraging the purchase of 
Macintosh II systems over Macintosh SE 
systems, and may soon implement a trade- 
in policy for a small number of its students 
to upgrade monitors.
The proposed plan comes as a large edu­
cational software development program 
nears completion in December.
According to Assistant Dean of H&SS 
Joseph Devine, the Macintosh II family of 
computers “possesses the capabilities our 
students need.” While university policy
does not allow H&SS to require students to 
purchase a computer, the college is push­
ing the Mac as its unofficial computer of 
choice, mainly becauseof Apple grants and 
students’ affinity for the Macintosh over 
the IBM.
As an attempt to facilitate the purchase 
of Macintosh II systems, H&SS may soon 
be implementing a trade-in policy allowing 
its students to purchase a Mac II with a 
normal monochrome monitor, and then 
trade the monitor for a more expensive 
portrait (full-page) monitor at no cost to 
the student.
The policy has not yet been certified
pending Apple’s new product releases that 
will occur this week.
H&SS Dean Stephen Fienberg says that 
the college has not announced its stand on 
the Macintosh II family officially because 
it has been busy developing the software to 
fit its educational needs.
However, both Fienberg and Tracy 
Futhey, director of computing for H&SS 
and director of the Computing Skills W ork- 
shop, believe a Macintosh II is an excellent 
purchase for anyone, regardless of major.
According to Futhey, a student should 
decide on purchasing a Mac “depending on 
how much you would use it... a Mac [lets
you] use your time more efficiently.” 
However, Futhey does not consider the 
purchase of a Macintosh II system (which 
costs about $4500) a necessity because 
she believes the current resources of Aca­
demic Computing’s clusters are sufficient. 
Futhey also does not believe that obsoles­
cence of a Macintosh II system should be 
a concern for today’s freshman. Says 
Futhey, “Students won’t be in trouble for 
the next four years.”
As for the actual academic need for a 
Macintosh II, Futhey has been involved 
in several major projects within the col- 
contlnued on page 3

Protesters march 
on Pretoria and 
Johannesburg
JOHANNESBURG (AP) — 
About 10,000 protesters, jogging, 
chanting, and waving banners, 
marched Friday through the heart 
of Johannesburg to a police head­
quarters where countless activ­
ists have been detained and inter­
rogated.
Another anti-government pro­
test, involving nearly 2,000 
people, took place at the central 
square in Pretoria, the capital.
Both protests were among the 
largest ever staged in the two 
cities, and dramatized the impact 
of President-elect F.W. de Klerk’s 
declaration this week that his 
white-led government would not 
block peaceful protests.
In Johannesburg, the march­
ers included black youths, dark-
suited white professionals, nuns 
and prominent activists, among 
them Winnie Mandela, wife of 
jailed black nationalist Nelson 
Mandela. Many youths carried 
posters demanding his release.
Organizers said the march was 
intended to demand an end to dis­
criminatory and restrictive laws 
so negotiations could begin on dis­
mantling apartheid.
Saudi King Fahd

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — 
King Fahd said in an interview 
published Wednesday that he was 
optimistic about the chances of a 
cease-fire and a settlement to 
Lebanon’s 14-year-old civil war.
In an interview with the news­

on the eve of the resumption of a 
Saudi-Moroccan-Algerian peace
mission, Fahd said “all parties to 
the conflict are more convinced 
that efforts must be continued to 
search for the suitable solutions. ”
He also said “all the new ele­

tite committee will find fertile 
ground to move for peace” in 
Lebanon.
The Lebanese factions without 
exception wanted peace and sta­
bility and were ready to sit at the 
negotiating table to save Leba­

The Arab committee, compris­
ing officials of Saudi Arabia, Al­
geria and Morocco, is to meet

Brazilian jetliner 
ditches into jungle
BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — A 
Boeing 737 jetliner made an 
emergency landing at an airport
in the Amazon jungle Tuesday, 
one week after a similar plane got 
lost and crashed in the rain for­
est, the Brazilian airline Varig 
said.
The plane was on a regular flight 
from Rio Branco to Cuba in the 
western Amazon region Sunday 
when it developed trouble in an
oil filter of the right engine, the 
company said in an official com­
munique.
The pilot was forced to make an 
emergency landing in the city of 
Vilhena, Varig said.
The 56 passengers and six crew 
members were unhurt and spent 
the night in the city while the 
engine was repaired, the airline 
said.
On Sept. 3, another Boeing 737 
belonging to Varigwent off course 
and crashed in the Amazon jungle 
near Sao Jose do Xingu, about
1,100 miles from its intended 
destination of Belem at the mouth

Alaska officials 
dissatisfied with 
Exxon cleanup
VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) — 
Alaska officials dispute claims 
from Exxon Corp. that its 25-week 
cleanup after the Prince William 
Sound oil spill left shorelines 
“environmentally stable.”
State officials agreed some 
shorelines were cleaner because 
$f Exxon’s efforts. But they dis­
puted the company’s rosy por­
trayal of an environmental re­
bound from nearly 11 million 
gallons of spilled crude.
Dennis Kelso, the state’s envi­
ronmental commissioner, toured 
shorelines on two islands south of 
Valdez yesterday and said he was 
not pleased with what he saw.
“This beach is not environmen­
tally stable,” he said as he poked 
a stick into thickly oiled rocks on 
Knight Island.
Kelso said the process has 
shown signs of success in some 
areas. In others, he said, it ap­
peared Exxon rushed to meet its 
self-imposed cleanup deadline.
The commissioner asked Exxon 
to continue to research effects of 
the spill. Exxon officials said the 
summer cleanup is over and the
company will continue to monitor 
the spill and respond to major 
problems.
Dinkins defeats 
Koch in New York 
mayoral primary
NEW YORK (AP) — David 
Dinkins pledged to become New 
York’s first black mayor after 
ending the colorful, combative 
Edward I. Koch’s 12-year reign 
over the nation’s biggest city in a 
"Democratic primary Thursday.
The Manhattan borough presi­
dent will face former U.S. attor­
ney Rudolph Giuliani, who 
thrashed cosmetics heir Ronald 
Lauder in the Republican primary 
yesterday.
Dinkins received 51 percent of 
the Democratic vote, compared to 
42 percent for Koch, with two 
other candidates splitting the 
remainder. Dinkins took more 
than 90 percent of the black vote, 
half the Hispanic vote and about 
30 percent of the white vote.
Giuliani, seeking to become the 
first Republican elected mayor 
since 1965, received 67 percent to 
33 percent for Lauder, whose 
record $12 million in campaign 
spending went mostly for nega­
tive television commercials.
Lauder, a former ambassador to 
Austria, will remain on the Nov. 7 
ballot as the Conservative Party’s 
nominee.
Koch, the vociferous symbol of 
New York to much of America, 
was first elected as a long shot in 
1977 while the city was in the 
throes of a fiscal crisis. He was re­
elected twice by huge margins.
Los Angeles Mayor 
Bradley may face 
civil charges
LOS ANGELES (AP) — An 
ethics probe of Mayor Tom Bra­
dley Wednesday found insuffi­
cient evidence he broke any crimi­
nal laws. But the probe cited fi- 
nancial-disclosure violations that 
could result in a reported $2.2 
million in civil fines.
City Attorney James Hahn filed 
a lawsuit containing the finan- 
cial-disclosure allegations at the 
same time he released a 1,600- 
page report on his five-month 
probe.
The investigation was prompted 
by conflict-of-interest questions 
about the mayor’s role as a paid 
adviser to two banks that did 
business with the city, Far East 
National Bank and Valley Fed­
eral Savings and Loan Associa-
tion.
“Either no evidence exists, or 
insufficient evidence exists, de­
pending on the particular trans­
action or interest involved, to 
prove actual violations of law by 
the mayor,” the city attorney 
concluded.
Nevertheless, Hahn was criti­
cal of the five-term mayor’s ethi­
cal conduct and his handling of 
his personal finances.
Bradley scheduled a news con­
ference later in the day to re­
spond to the report.
Hahn’s suit alleges Bradley 
intentionally or negligently failed 
to report six investments involv­
ing hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in such companies as L.A. 
Gear, Metromedia Inc. and Trans 
World Airlines.
Violations of state financial- 
disclosure laws don’t carry any 
criminal penalties but can result 
in fines.

Modern Language program splits from History; 
faculty committee considers a new department
By RHONDA S. STRUMINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
After ten years of being part of the 
History Department, the Modem Lan­
guages program is being given the op­
portunity to once again stand on its own.
According to H&SS Dean Stephen E. 
Fienberg, the question of what to do with 
the language department has been quite 
popular since he became dean in 1987. 
The issue was resolved by a faculty 
committee which decided it was best to 
re-create a hew program for the lan- 
..guages.
Says Fienberg, ‘The realization that 
English can not stand alone world wide 
has brought about the understanding 
that any college would be remiss if it did 
not offer a substantial language depart- 
“ment.” Since most of the old faculty from 
the Modern Language department of ten 
years ago has retired, the process of “re­
addressing what the language depart­
ment should be, will be easier,” said 
Fienberg.
A visiting associate professor from the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Cham- 
paign, Dr. Nina Garrett, is spending one 
year at CMU to help with the proposed 
transition from program status to full 
department status. Her task is to give 
seminars to faculty on the use of comput­
ers in a second language, language-ac- 
quisition theory, and language learning.
Garrett describes her purpose here as 
a way “to get computers integrated in the 
development of a uniquely-CMU pro­
gram.” The computers would then allow 
Modem Languages to begin work with 
other areas of interest such as cognitive 
psychology, computational linguistics, 
and the revitalization of English as a 
secondlanguage, according to Dean Fien­
berg.
Professor Juris Silenieks, the only 
remaining tenured faculty member of 
the old Language Department, is cur­
rently the director of the new Program in 
Modem Languages. While under the 
History Department, Silenieks says that 
the language program was “treated very 
fairly” and that it had jurisdiction over 
its own programs. Now the program is 
“academically and administratively 
separate from the History Department 
and has direct control over its budget.”
The program still maintains some 
connection with History, though, as 
students are only allowed to major in 
languages as half of a double major.
Peter Steams, head of the History 
Department, said that having Modem 
Languages in Ms department was 
“awkward.” Steams also said that “even 
though there is overlapping between
culture and language education, the 
primary purpose of a History Depart­
ment is history, not language.”
Steams said that Modem Languages 
was put into the History Department 
under Dean Pat Crecine in 1978 because 
Crecine was “hostile towards Modem 
Languages.” According to Steams, the 
program was at a low point then and 
Crecine would have gotten rid of it alto­
gether if it hadn’t been for Professor 
Schaefer, then head of the History De­
partment. With the danger of losing the 
department, Schaefer offered to incorpo­
rate it into History. The associate direc­
tor of the new Modem Language pro­
gram, Christopher Hallstein, agreed that 
“without Schaefer’s support, CMU would 
have been completely devoid of a lan­
guage department.”
Hallstein said that when the Modem 
Language Department was merged with 
History, the faculty was very disap­
pointed. Now he says that he “looks for­
ward to the new flexibility in the depart­
ment as well as the new opportunities 
ahead.”
With eleven faculty members teaching 
five languages, the department is still 
small but growing. The enrollment has 
continued to increase every year in 
number, with 500 students taking lan­
guage courses and 60 double majoring.

color; an Andrew utility package; 
a logic tutor program for the Phi­
losophy Department; and an eth­
ics program.
A true Andrew environment on 
the Mac, which is still in beta, or 
test, version, is forthcoming from 
Academic Computing, and will 
probably be available by the 
spring semester. Says Fienberg, 
“The college is committed to use 
the Macintosh as more than a
word processor.”
With the implementation of 
Macintosh throughout class­
rooms, Fienberg is promotingthe 
Macintosh as the unofficial com­
puter of H&SS. Fienberg ex­
pressed hope that “the Mac will 
become an integral part of not 
only what teachers teach but also 
how they teach it.”
The college is currently search­
ing for ways to defray some of the 
costs a student would have to pay 
for a Mac II system, especially 
through Apple grants. However, 
financial aid will still not pay 
directly for the purchase of a
computer.
According to Futhey, it is “highly 
probable” that H&SS may use an 
Apple grant to encourage the pur­
chase of Macintosh systems 
through the availability of moni­
tor upgrades.
Under this program, the col­
lege would be willing to make a 
trade of a portrait-size (15 inch) 
monochrome monitor for a 
student’s normal-size (12 inch) 
monochrome monitor, which 
would represent a savings of$463, 
not including tax and extra war­
ranties.
This aid program could be al­
tered as Apple announces its fall 
lineup of new products next week- 
Says Futhey, “If Apple comesout 
with new stuff, we’ll adjust.” 
Futhey says she is not concerned 
with people transferringto H&SS 
to get the free monitor and trans­
ferring back. “We just look at our 
student’s needs. If others [nori- 
H&SS students] are jealous, then 
maybe the other colleges should 
look at this too.”
Full details of the aid program 
may be announced at Parents’ 
Day in October, and an informa­
tion pamphlet will be sent out to 
prospective H&SS students.

Approximately fifty students, 
faculty, and others gathered in 
the Wherrett Room Tuesday to 
pay their respects to those who 
died in the uprising in Tien- 
nanmen Square on June 4.
September 12 was the 100 day 
anniversary of the invasion of 
Tiennanmen Square. “Memory 
Day” was hosted by the Chinese 
Graduate Student Organizations 
of Carnegie Mellon and the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh.
Michael Murphy, acting dean 
of Student Affairs, introduced 
“China ... The Crisis Continues” 
as the first of a series of Student 
Affairs-sponsored discussions 
collectively called The Forum. The
purpose of the The Forum is to 
increase campus understanding 
of cultural and religious diversity 
and of social developments.
HongYan, presidentofthe CMU 
organization and a graduate stu­
dent in industrial administration, 
introduced the two scheduled 
speakers.
Dr. Glasco, professor of Ameri­
can history at the University of 
Pittsburgh, spoke first. Having 
spent a month in Beijing from 
May 4 to June 7, he gave his 
perspective of culture and democ­
racy in China. Speaking of the 
student movements for democ­
racy, Glasco said that he was 
struck by “the simple power of the 
idea,” and by the completely posi­
tive and hopeful atmosphere 
conveyed by the demonstrators.
Glasco said he was impressed 
by the bravery of citizens from all 
age groups and occupations. “They 
were not afraid of dying,” he said. 
Added Glasco, “The saddest thing 
was that there were no memorial 
services for the dead students.” 
Larry Young, a PhD candidate 
in chemistry at Pitt, reported on 
the efforts of Chinese students 
within the United States to help 
their struggling countrymen.
Young told how the Confedera­
tion of Chinese Students of North 
America convened in Chicago at 
the University of Illinois over the 
summer to discuss a course of 
action given the tumultuous situ­
ation in Beijing.
Representatives from 182 uni­
versities across the country at­
tended the conference, in addi­
tion to three hundred other stu­
dents. The objective of the confer­
ence was to promote democracy 
in China through nonviolent 
means, focusing on such key prin­
ciples as freedom of the press and 
freedom of assembly.
As a result, the Independent' 
Federation of Chinese Students 
and Scholars in the U.S.A. was 
formed to mediate student rela­
tions with China and to organize 
memorials all over the United 
States.
The Federation’s founders be­
lieved that it would play a signifi­
cant role in China’s fight for 
democracy. One planned activity 
is a student march in Washing­
ton, D.C. on October 1, marking 
the anniversary of the official 
existence ofthe Republic of China.
GSIA and Apple Computer enter hardware-for-software trade partnership
By TIMOTHY K. SCOFF
Tattan Staffvuriter
'Following a nationwide search, Apple 
Computer has granted several software 
projects to GSIA. In return for the devel­
opment of software, Apple is giving GSIA 
$49,000 worth of Macintosh equipment, 
including ten Mac Ilex machines.
“GSIA has formed a partnership with 
Apple Computer,” said Meena Lakhvani, 
head of GSIA computing. “Apple sent out 
inquiries to business schools, and we 
'sènt in a proposal for twelve projects 
that we would work on with the comput­
ers provided,by Apple. We were compet­
ing with other business schools [for the 
computers].”
Apple has provided computers for four 
of the projects. The projects include an 
information management system, a triple 
en^ry accounting system, a multi-media 
simulation tracking congressional roll 
call voting, and a tutorial system for 
using financial planning software.
“Apple is giving us the computers and 
hardware. We are using them to develop
software for use in GSIA and we are 
giving the software to Apple,” saidLakha- 
vani. “Apple will be receiving quarterly 
reports from us on how the project is 
going, and hopefully Apple will be updat­
ing the hardware periodically. This is 
not a one-time grant; it is a continuing 
process.”
“The main purpose ofthe computers is 
to do research,” said Javiar Lerch, an 
instructor at GSIA. “We are just building 
prototypes, not a finished product. Apple 
is not going to receive software ready for 
sale on the open market.”
“We are publishing all the results of 
our research in scientific journals and 
magazines, and anyone who wanted to 
use it to build commercial software would 
have equal access to our work,” said 
Lerch.
The information management system 
is being developed by Lakhavani. “This 
will be a database system that will inte­
grate all of the administrative functions 
of GSIA.”
Says Lakhavani,“Functions unique to 
a department will be accessible only by
“Apple Is giving us the computers and hard­
ware. We are using them to develop software 
for use in GSIA and we are giving the soft­
ware to Apple.”

Meena Lakhvani
that department. At higher levels infor­
mation can be pulled and distributed to 
different departments as needed.” 
Lakhavani’s project will take at least 
two to three years to be completed.
The accounting system is being di­
rected by economics professor Yuji Ijiri, 
who will develop a system in which “eco­
nomic momentum” will be added to the 
more conventional and static factors of 
wealth and income in predicting changes 
in the economy.
Professors Keith Poole and Howard 
Rosenthal will develop the multi-media 
simulation. “We have already put some 
of the data in, and we are two or three 
months away from having all of the data 
in the computer,” says Lerch.
Accoring to Lerch, the project is nearly 
completed. “We currently have records 
up to 1985 in the system, and we expect 
it to take six to nine months after that is 
completed to expand the system to show 
maps of the United States in full color.”
“The system will have every roll call 
vote in Congress from the first Congress 
to the current Congress, and can be 
updated continuously,” Lerch added.
“This will be an educational tool,” says 
Lerch. “Anyone will be able to sit down 
and look at, for example, a vote on abol­
ishing slavery right before the civil war 
and see on a map who voted how, and 
where they lived. This would show the 
division of the North and the South very 
clearly, demonstrating block voting in 
American politics.”
Lerch is developing the tutorial sys­
tem. “We want to build a tutorial system 
to teach students to interact with data 
base management systems, and retrieve 
valuable data from them.”
“We also want to learn where people 
have problems when they interact with 
computers trying to retrieve informa­
tion,” said Lerch. “If we understand the > 
problems, we can build aids to circum­
vent these problems.”
After the software has been developed, 
the project directors will keep the equip­
ment.

Cyert earns less than CMU’s top five, Pitt’s Posvar, other CEOs
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Software Engineering Institute Direc­
tor Larry Druffel earned $151,475 in 
fiscal year 1987-88, over $45,000 more 
than President Richard Cyert, according 
to data reported in last week’s Chronicle 
of Higher Education.
Cyert’s salary was also eclipsed by 
those of professors Herbert Simon, Allan 
Meltzer, Allen Newell, Yuji Ijiri, and 
Vice President for Business Affairs 
Frederick Rogers, the Chronicle reported.
However, Cyert’s base salary of 
$105,300 did not include an estimated 
$85,000 the University contributed to 
his deferred-compensation plan.
Cyert’s reported salary was also less 
than the salaries of the chief executives

of Case Western Reserve, Columbia, 
Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, 
Princeton, Stanford, University of Chi­
cago, and Yale, according to the Chron­
icle.
Cyert’s base salary was more than that 
of Washington University President
William Danforth, who had the lowest 
salary of any chief executive of one of the 
country’s top 25 private research univer­
sities, the Chronicle said. Danforth is a 
member of the family that earned its 
money through the food-processing 
company Ralston Purina; he is thought
to be independently wealthy.
An article in Friday’s Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette confirmed that Cyert also earned 
less than Pitt President Wesley Posvar 
and Duquesne’s then-acting President 
Rolando Bonachea in 1987-88.
However, the Chronicle cautioned that 
the salaries of chief executives were not 
directly comparable because of the dif­
ferent benefits packages each receives. 
Cyert’s deferred compensation of 
$85,000, which was not included in his 
base salary, is considered to be high for a 
university president, the Chronicle re­
ported.

Marriott takes over campus vending management

Tartan Staffwriter
As of August 28, Marriott has 
officially taken over the vending 
program at Carnegie Mellon. The 
decision to switch was made be­
cause both parties saw the change 
as a mutual benefit.
One change in the vending 
program is the increased price of 
juice products at the beginning of 
this year from 60 to 65 cents. “The 
increase in the price was very 
necessary,” said Vending Super­
intendent Jim Gurley. “The juices 
were underpriced before. Even at
the present price, they are more 
than a fair price. Sometimes these 
juices were sold for 70 cents 
somewhere else.”
According to Gurley, Marriott 
has been the food services con­
tractor on campus for eight years. 
“They were looking for a way to 
increase their presence on cam­
pus,” said Gurley, “and they saw 
the vending services as a very 
good way to do so.”
Oscar Mayer, director of auxil­
iary services, added that Marri­
ott had approached CMU as early 
as a year ago to look for a way to 
increase investment in the Uni­
versity.
“The switch was made not be­
cause the vending program at 
CMU has any deficiency,” said 
Roger Heydt, the Marriott man­
ager on campus. “CMU has al­
ways had a strong and sound 
vending program. However, 
Marriott has more experience in 
running a vending program.”
According to Heydt, Marriott 
hopes to build on the old program. 
Gurley and Heydt both believe 
that with Marriott leading the 
business, they can better serve 
the students and the faculty.
Another change Marriott will
bring to campus is the introduc­
tion of VeryFine Juice products. 
This program will feature five 
100% juice products: orange, 
apple, grapefruit, pineapple, and 
fruit punch; and two blended juice 
products, apple raspberry and 
apple cranberry. Lemonade will 
also be introduced. Each will be 
sold for 65 cents.
Gurley expects these products 
will be on campus by Thursday at 
the latest. Heydt expects students 
to respond favorably, because the 
products taste better, they give 
two ounces more juice per serv­
ing, and there is more selection
Freshman Pilot Program provides forum for discussion
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Freshman year.
For some it is a time of joyful anticipa­
tion; for others, a time of strange and 
foreboding new experiences.
Formost, however, itis atimeof change 
and uncertainty, and it was with these 
considerations in mind that the Housing 
Office created the Freshman Pilot Pro­
gram.
Currently in its third year of opera­
tion, the program is the indirect result of 
a conversation between housing Area 
Coordinator Teresa Campbell and act­
ing Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy.
“There was a belief thatalthough we’re 
a very small university, we treat people 
as a number ... that we as a university 
didn’t do enough to recognize the indi­
vidual worth of people,” said Campbell. 
“There was also a belief that all this 
university does very well is academics— 
that we just didn’t deal with students’ 
issues. The outgrowth of those concerns 
was the Freshman Pilot Program.”
The program itself consists of five to 
six discussion groups per semester, with
“There was a belief that we treat people as a 
number, that we just didn't deal with stu­
dents' issues. The outgrowth of those con­
cerns was the Freshman Pilot Program.”
— Program director Teresa Campbell
ten to fifteen students in each group. The 
students meet for one and a half- to two- 
hour sessions dealing with a variety of 
student issues.
Campbell said that the program’s co­
ordinators introduce topics for discus­
sion in the first sessions, but as the 
program progresses, the students them­
selves are encouraged to submit their 
own topics, questions, and problems.
Among topics discussed in the past 
were such issues as adjustment to cam­
pus life, survival skills, stress manage­
ment, alcohol and drugs, sex, time man­
agement, interpersonal relations, com­
munication skills, and dealing with com­
petition.
The program is led by Campbell, along
with Director of Housing Tony Martin, 
Assistant Director of Housing Amy 
Ginther, and Area Coordinators Susanne 
Ferrin, Cindy Sammons, and Kent Fer­
ris. In àddition to the program’s staff, the 
meetings are also alternately attended 
by several resident assistants, many of 
whom were themselves former partici­
pants in the program.
So far 200 people have registered for 
this semester’s program, which is more 
than double the average registration in 
the past. “The more we do it, the more it 
gets recognized,” said Campbell.
Space is not limited, and interested 
freshmen may still enroll. Anyone inter­
ested should contact Teresa Campbell in 
the Housing Office at x2139.
GSIA, SOS, and CIT combine 
efforts to form new information 
networking master’s program
By RICHARD KWIATKOWSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
Today’s business world has put in a 
pleafor highly-trained individuals who 
can handle information networking, 
the vast applications of computers and 
telecommunications. Carnegie Mellon 
has answered the call by establishing 
the InformationNetworking Institute, 
or INI.
INI is a partnership between CIT, 
the School of Computer Science, and 
GSIA, which offers a master’s degree 
in information networking. According 
to Alex Hills, director of INI, “It took 
the support of all three to get the 
program off the ground.”
The INI program will give students 
the opportunity to he educated in all 
aspects ofinformation networking, not 
just the engineering or business as­
pect of the technology. “There is an
incredible job market open to those 
who understand information network­
ing. There are very few .people who 
can function in all three aspects of in­
formation networking; those who can 
are worth their weight in gold,” said 
Hills. Faculty members from CIT, 
SCS, and GSIA will teach the various 
courses of the program.
To be admitted in the program, stu­
dents must have a BS in ECE or com­
puter science and must go through 
the normal graduate school admis­
sions process. Twenty-four students 
are in the first class, which began this 
fall. Most of the students are employ­
ees of Bellcore, formerly Bell Labs, 
which is funding the new program.
Students in the new program face a 
very demanding schedule. It is com­
prised of five courses per semester, fo­
cusing on ECE courses the first se-

“the opportunity to share ideas 
with people in a place where ideas 
have been modified or suppressed 
is a marvelous concept.... Teach­
ing is about sharing.” Cavalier 
expects to see future contribu­
tions to the field of design from 
the SovietB. “They were really 
pioneers in the visual fields until 
suppressed under Stalin.”
The search for people to con­
duct the seminars in the USSR 
was a result of a nationwide so­
licitation by USXA, according to 
Cleary. “They invited proposals
from across the country.... We 
basically had the righv, ideas and 
the right combination of people to 
act on them.”
Paul Rosenblatt will be part of 
the November group involving 
Cavalier, Cleary, and visiting 
associate professor in design Steve 
Stadelmeier. Says Rosenblatt, 
“resumes and proposals had to be 
submitted to the United States

“I think what should happen is 
what did happen, and that we 
should find some other space for 
the cluster,” said CIT Dean Paul 
Christiano. “I worry about a state­
ment like that, though, because 
it's a lot easier to say than to do.”
Cyert told The Tartan that three 
new clusters are in the works: 
one to be located on campus and 
run by the Department of Me­
chanical Engineering; one in 
Mellon Institute to be run by 
Academic Computing; and a third 
to be located in the dorm cur­
rently under construction, also to 
be run by Academic Computing.
According to Cyert, the first two 
clusters should open sometime 
this year, while the third will not 
open until the new dorm becomes 
operational next fall.
“The idea has never been that

CMLFs role in the exhibitions is 
not limited to the seminars. The 
24 Russian-speaking guides who 
will act as translators during the 
entire 19 month exhibition were 
trained at CMU.
They completed an intensive 
seven-day training program in 
architecture, design, and desktop 
publishing here while gaining fa­
miliarity with the use of IBM PCs 
and Macintoshes.

It’s a sexually motivated thing.” 
Stewart maintains that gays have a 
right to be in the Dithridge Street area if 
they’re not breakingthe law. “Whatwe’re 
saying is that most of the people who are 
in this area aren’t doing anything illegal.
' Therefore, they do not deserve to be 
stopped by the police and given the kind 
of harassment they’re getting. It’s legal

a safe and legal manner.”
Michael Franzini, a research program­

which may be legitimate at times, as a 
pretext for harassment.” Stewart said 
that “they do this because of their own 
homophobia, and their lack of sensitivity 
in dealing with gay and lesbian people.” 
Franzini related an incident that oc­
curred recently to him and a few other 
members of CRY OUT! in the Dithridge 
Street area. “We were walking around 
the sidewalk, and this police officer drove 
up to us, drove along side us, rolled down 
his window, and just stared at us, driv­
ing alongside us as we walked. Wecircled 
the block.
“His intent was clearly to intimidate 
us because we weren’t breaking the law 
and he had nothing to say to us. He 
persisted for about twenty minutes after 
which he said You guys had better get 
into your cars and drive away right now.’
“I commend the police officers here tonight. 
The woman from Zone Six behaved exactly as 
I I would expect and would want a police offi-

loud on the street, but it’s much less 
serious of a situation than it is near the 
fraternities.”
Franzini said that he felt that “the 
most serious problem that gays in Pitts­
burgh have is the fact that [Pittsburgh] 
police are harassing people who have a
I got in my car and drove away, but the 
others stayed, and, in fact, the cop didn’t 
arrest them. He just continued to follow 
them.”
Stewart complimented the behavior of 
Pittsburgh Police at Saturday’s protest. 
“I commend the police officers here to­
night. The woman 
from [Pittsburgh 
Police Zone] Six 
behaved exactly as I 
would expect and 
would want a police 
officer to behave. I 
am not saying this 
problem is with 
every police officer.
There are obviously 
good police officers.
It’s just something 
the police force has 
to deal with. There 
is a problem in the 
department because 
they don’t address 
these issues.”
Franzini, Ste­
wart, and CRY 
OUT! activist Bill 
Hileman described 
various incidents 
that they knew of in 
which they claim 
Pittsburgh Police harassed them and 
others in the area using offensive lan­
guage and intimidation.
Stewart said that it is reasonable to 
warn individuals who are disturbing the 
peace, but he feels that “you don’t walk 
up to someone and say, You fucking 
faggots, get the hell out of here, or you’re 
under arrest.’ ” Says Stewart, “the ‘fuck­
ing faggot’thingis somethingthatis said 
on a regular basis.”
Hileman claimed that Pittsburgh Po­
lice once blocked offboth ends ofWinthrop 
Street with police vehicles and issued 
the drivers of the trapped vehicles $300 
citations for obstructing traffic. He said

man said, “people who were very afraid 
[for] their jobs or of their wives or what­

reluctant [to go to court], and then just

Hileman also related an incident in 
which he saw a Pittsburgh Police officer 
accost two people near Dithridge Street. 
One of the officers turned to Hileman, 
who was a bystander, and said “You had 
better get the fuck out of this area, or 
you’re going to have a boot up your ass 
instead of a dick.”

According to Hills, the program 
lackedpublicityforits initial year,
which accounts for the high 
number students from Bellcore. 
He says that next year the plan is 
to have forty students from 
Bellcore and twenty students from 
other areas. Hills stressed that 
the program is open to anyone, 
provided he or she has a BS in 
ECE or computer science, and that 
there will be more publicity for 
the second year of INI.
The INI program will offer more 
than a masters degree. Plans are
in the works for a fourteen week,

program for Bellcore employees. 
In addition, interested faculty 
members will soon be able to do 
research in information network­

Hills said that CMU “is the 
perfect place to have the INI pro­

make a success out of this new 
program.”

What exactly is being protected?
The United States has no Queen 
Elizabeth, or Mecca, or Wailing 
Wall; our most sacred national 
symbol is the flag. To many Ameri­
cans, the flag symbolizes our na­
tion, our people, and our belief in 
fundamental individual freedom.
But we at The Tartan feel that 
the flag’s special status as the 
symbol of our country shouldn’t 
allow Congress to limit our free­
dom of expression.
People cannot be forced to re­
spect the flag, or to accept it as a 
symbol for only the good deeds of 
our nation, just as they cannot be 
forced to vote or pray. To some 
citizens, the flag represents the 
atrocities and misdeeds the United 
States commits, ostensibly in the 
name of the freedoms we wish to 
advance — atrocities such as ra­
cism, the support of dictatorships, 
and poverty.
And until this country is a dicta­
torship, we’d like to remind Con­
gress and President Bush that 
;jfetriotism is voluntary.
Last week the House of Repre­
sentatives approved a bill which 
¦would “protect” the physical in­
tegrity of the flag, prohibiting a 
host of actions such as burning it 
or displaying it on the ground. To
make sure that the proposed law 
is constitutional, the Senate will 
soon vote on a constitutional 
amendment to prohibit flag dese­
cration.
What’s wrong with this plan? 
Our founding fathers passed the 
First Amendment, guaranteeing 
the freedom of expression, primar­
ily to allow us to protest against 
our government with impunity. 
Other rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution are essentially sec­
ondary to our ability to exercise 
this ultimate check on the actions 
of our government.
As a symbol of our country, the 
flag is paradoxically a symbol of 
those same rights Congress seems 
poised to restrict.
Today, the freedom of expres­
sion represented by the flag is 
constantly being tested. We are 
faced with proposed limits on what 
canbe advertised, what words can 
be spoken on TV, what art can be 
publicly funded, what magazines 
can be provided for the blind, and 
what music can be broadcast.
Fortunately, we still have the 
right to tell our government that 
we think it’s wrong. We all should 
exercise that right while we still 
have it.
Sexual harassment takes many forms
Dithridge Street — which has 
been in the news over the past five 
years because of Carnegie Mellon’s 
controversial Software Engineer­
ing Institute — is back at the 
center of attention this week. This 
time around, the street is involved 
in a controversy with a more per­
sonal flair.
According to gays both on and 
off campus, Dithridge Street, a 
well-known gay “cruising ground, ” 
is the site of recent harassment of 
gays by the Pittsburgh Police. 
Some gays even charge that police 
harassment along Dithridge is the 
cause of the recent murder of 
David Piergalski in Schenley 
Park.
The new Dithridge Street con­
troversy is symptomatic of a big­
ger, more serious problem. It’s 
something we, at Carnegie Mel­
lon, tend to think doesn’t happen 
around us or to people we know.
The problem is sexual harass­
ment, and we are very much mis­
taken to think that we are “im­
mune.”
Harassment takes many differ­
ent forms. It may, include bodily 
harm, verbal abuse, sexist com-

Master Plan turns the Cut into a prison yard
ments, and discrimination. It can 
be inflicted, intentionally or unin­
tentionally, by anyone, on any­
one, at any time. It affects us and 
those around us, and it is very 
real.
Unfortunately, this space is far 
too short to go into all the details 
of sexual harassment. The idea, 
however, is that there’s a fine line 
between just joking, or flirting, or 
trying to pick someone up, and 
harassment. Every time one per­
son starts to get close to another’s 
“sexual space,” there’s a risk of 
overstepping the boundaries of 
acceptable conduct.
There’s a simple solution to this 
problem, a solution so elegant 
we’re surprised it wasn’t learned 
in kindergarten where it was first 
taught. We — all of us — need to 
develop a healthy respect for the 
rights of others, whether they’re 
gay or straight, male or female, 
old or young.
Hopefully, we’ll all get our acts 
together soon — and we’ll let 
Dithridge Street return to a sleepy 
little place that nobody can quite 
remember enough to be able to 
point out on a map.
Editor:
One of the best things about the Car­
negie Mellon campus is its balance be­
tween spaces that are enclosed by walls 
and spaces that are enclosed by nothing 
at all.
I am writing this letter because I value 
these open spaces, the most prominent of 
which happens to be the Cut. The Cut is 
large and green and empty; it is the 
center of our campus. If you stand in the 
middle of it, you can see just about every­
thing that is going on.
Anyone who has ever seen the Cut can 
understand that it does more for those of 
us who live and work on this campus
Letters to the Editor
than could any space surrounded by 
walls. Yet what do you suppose is in store 
for the Cut with the construction of the 
new University Center? Yes, I’m afraid 
you’re right; they plan to surround it by 
walls.
If you are unfamiliar with Master Plans 
for Carnegie Mellon, I urge you to take a 
look; they’re on display in Skibo (if it was 
my idea, I sure wouldn’t want anyone to 
see it). Imagine, however, standing in 
the middle of a Cut surrounded by walls.
You’d look around and all you would see 
is somebody’s window. If you like sun-1 
bathing, forget it, you’d be forever in the 
shadow of the new buildings.
The Cut just wouldn’t be the same with 
walls around it. It would becomesome- 
thing like a prison yard. This new plan 
would not only ruin the Cut, it would 
ruin the entire campus.
I realize, however, that Carnegie Mel­
lon is in dire need of new student facili­
ties, but filling up every nook and cranny 
with a building is not the way to do it.

Students should be informed about what they’re hearing
Editor:
I was distressed to learn today that the 
Student Affairs Office was sponsoring a 
seminar by a group called “The Forum” 
that will:
focus on risks and rewards of reli­
gious difference and offer a chance 
for members of the campus commu­
nity to explore how the barriers cre­
ated by religious difference can be 
overcome.
My distress comes from the fact that 
“The Forum” is itself a pseudo-religious 
organization although its members would
deny this. Many people will probably be 
familiar with the former name of “The 
Forum”—“est.” The library’s online ver­
sion of the Academic American Encyclo­
pedia has the following entry on “est”:
Erhard Seminars Training, or est, 
developed in 1971 by Werner Erhard, 
purports to transform personality. 
People are trained, by means of ver­
bal interaction and physical stress, 
in groups of about 250. Although 
many have found it worthwhile, est 
remains controversial because of the 
authoritarian aspects of the train­
ing, because of the stress and verbal
abuse involved, and because of the 
lack of scientific validation.
While the University should encour­
age the free exchange of ideas and phi­
losophies I believe that it is important 
that these ideas not be veiled or ob­
scured. My purpose therefore is not tot 
discourage this free exchange but rather 
to inform those people who would take 
part in it.

Remember when cutting classes was 
the “cool” thing to do? Well now you are 
in college, where you are away from your 
parents and get to make your own deci­
sions. Here, not only can you cut class 
and get away with it, cutting is practi­
cally encouraged.
Think back to the first week of lectures 
and how crowded the classrooms were. 
There probably weren’t enough seats for 
everyone and some people had to sit on 
the stairs.
Envision what that same class looks 
like today. There’s plenty of room for 
eveiyone, seats are empty here and there, 
and the last few rows most likely don’t 
have a soul in them.
You see, the administration knows that 
a good percentage of students are going 
to cut class, so, in turn, they “over-en- 
roll.”
The only problem comes at test time, 
because everyone shows up for a test.
Stephen Glicker
Most professors are experienced and 
know to handle this crisis. They split the 
class up into several rooms. Doing so not 
only makes more space in between stu­
dents, preventing them from cheating, 
but it covers up the administration’s 
over-enrollment error. Everyone is happy 
in the end.
Now comes the question of whether or 
not to attend a lecture. To answer this 
question, try some simple arithmetic. 
When you went to high school, it cost you 
nothing (unless you went to private 
school, but that’s your fault). Your par­
ents paid for your schooling out of local 
taxes.
Now that you go to college, however, 
it’s costing you a minimum of thirteen 
grand (not including room and board,
meal plan, books, probably a computer,», 
etc.) for just one single year. That comes 
out to $6500 per semester.
Now figure that you probably have five 
classes per week (costing you $1300 per 
class per semester) for fifteen weeks ($87 
per week) that probably meet twice or: 
three times a week (around $35 per class). 
What that means in the long run is that 
each class you miss could have bought 
you three CDs. Not a very pleasant 
thought, is it?
Well, while you’re out there cutting a 
class because you are sleeping late, play­
ing games, or recovering from that hang­
over from the night before, look on the 
bright side — at least you’re getting the 
most out of your room and board.

People go to parties and drink for solid reasons
The next time you’re at a party, stop 
what you’re doing, standback, and watch. 
With that weird concentration that the 
combination of adrenaline/beer gives you, 
look around and try to see what people 
are doing.
It may be blatantly obvious, but they’re 
trying to adjust. Suffering from home­
sickness — and I don’t care what any­
body says, everyone here is homesick — 
a large group of newly strange people try 
to arrange the world so that it makes 
sense to them, so they can get their 
bearings and stop bouncing around from 
reaction to reaction.
Defining homesickness is hard. I don’t 
mean the cliché of crying on the first 
night of overnight camp, but something 
more subtle, more disturbing. What 
people are missing is a support network
— people to keep them sane. Be it your 
parents, close friends, brothers, whom-

ever, they’re no longer next to you. Gone 
are the people whom you could call at all 
hours of the night, who somehow always 
understood you. They never made fun of 
you, and always accepted you for who 
you were.
Removing that net, along with the 
shock of a complete change of environ­
ment, sucks. Here we are, in a strange 
new place, with new people, new experi­
ences, homework forever, and when the 
need to talk suddenly comes, you can’t 
always satisfy it. Late at night, the buzz 
wearing off, dancing high in the wall, it 
suddenly hits you—you don’t want to be 
here. Tonight, instead of getting stupid, 
you would have preferred to sit down 
with your old friends and talk, figure
things out. Find the people who under­
stood you, and let them talk to you—just 
sit, listen, and think.
That’s when it’s hard. That’s when the 
realization hits you that, in a weird way, 
you are alone in a room full of people. 
You’ve only known them for three weeks- 
You need people that you’ve known 
years.
Lacking really close friends, you’d 
better keep your mind occupied. And 
where is the best place to blot out every­
thing with sensory overload?
That’s right — let’s go drinking, guys- 
That’s a weird reaction, when you think 
about it. Why do the one thing guaran­
teed to lower your inhibitions and brinS 
otherwise unwanted thoughts to the 
surface? Why do the one thing that wfr 
force you to either squat down and stare 
the problem in the face, or run away in*0

(Herblock is on vacation)
Becoming a killer shouldn’t be so easy in America
LOUISVILLE, Ky.} September 
15 (AP) —A man with an assault 
rifle mowed down co-workers as 
he went from floor to floor “look­
ing for bosses¦" at a printing plant 
yesterday, killing seven people and 
wounding 13 before taking his own 
life.
This sentence appeared as the 
lead paragraph of a front page 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette story last 
Friday, although I am not sure 
why. The front page of a newspa­
per is usually reserved for un­
usual or important stories and 
this story is neither.
Incidents like this have occurred 
in a number of places around the 
country in the last year and can 
hardly be called unusual. The 
most memorable have been two 
attacks on schools in Winnetka, 
Illinois and Stockton, California, 
in which a total of six children 
were killed and many others were
jHopwspo Tabu
wounded.
This incident is also not impor­
tant, at least not to people in 
policy setting positions who could 
act to restrict access to deadly 
weapons. Apparently, such people 
do not have the time or interest to 
do so.
It should be obvious by now 
that the current gun laws are not 
sufficient to keep weapons out of 
the hands of criminally insane 
people. Both of the school yard 
shooters mentioned above had 
previous records of mental illness 
and/or criminal activity but still 
managed to obtain weapons.
The same is true of Edith An­
derson, the mental patient who 
killed a social worker at St. 
Francis Medical Center in Febru­
ary 1988. She did not own the
handgun she used, but stole it 
from the owner, her mother.
I would not be surprised if, by 
the time this column is printed, 
the authorities discover that last 
week’s Kentucky shooter had a 
record which should have pre­
vented him from owning an as­
sault rifle.
It is clear what must be done. 
Federal and state laws must be 
passed to severely limit gun 
ownership and keep firearms out 
of the hands of likely killers.
I know that there are people 
who enjoy using guns for recrea­
tional purposes and many of them 
would undoubtedly be denied 
guns under toughened laws. 
However, the recreational desires 
of a few people can not justify the 
sort of carnage taking place in 
this country. I am sure there are 
people who would like to race cars 
recreationally on highways and 
city streets, but they are not al­
lowed to do so because of the 
danger to innocent people. Why 
shouldn’t this attitude apply "to 
guns which, unlike cars, are de­
signed for the specific purpose of 
killing?
Past history indicates that there 
will be a few “copycat” shootings 
around the country based on last 
week’s murders. It is too late to do 
anything about such tragedies, 
except hope that they take as few 
lives as possible.
However, something can be 
done about the killings which are 
destined to be committed beyond 
that time. If this country takes 
action to keep guns out of the 
hands of dangerous people, lives 
will be saved. It doesn’t get much 
clearer than that.

Kill the babies?! What happened

I Just when you thought Jeff 
Fartro (former conservative col­
umnist forThe Tartan) had gradu­
ated ... I will be a conservative 
thom-in-the-side of you liberal 
activists out there during the 
\ course of the year. I am going to 
make you think about your posi­
tion. Let me also say that I’m a 
radical Christian (but do not dare 
call me a “fundamentalist,” be­
cause no one, including myself,

attach to suitable people).
In this column, I will be dis­
cussing various Christian related 
politics and the like. I do not want 
, ..to get nitty-gritty political. We’ll
discuss some fun topics.
Now to the hot potato/issue at 
hand. Many of the concerns activ­
ists bring up are perfectly agree­
able. But I have trouble under­
standing how the same person 
will risk arrest to save the life of 
some animal while approving the 
killing of equally innocent unborn 
babies. Are animals worth more 
than human lives?
Ah, but saving animals is OK 
because it doesn’t interfere with 
our sex lives. We’ll abstain from 
meat to save an animal, but God 
forbid that we should abstain from 
pre-marital sex to prevent an 
unnecessary human death.
Get it right, people. Be consis­
tent. And you scream “Hypocrisy!” 
to us. But that’s another topic.
Write to me, Box 1910.1 won’t 
necessarily address every issue 
that comes up, but I enjoy feed­

of the students here, you had no 
problems adjusting to college life.
Basically, I had no problems

along the way did dampen my

determined not to let it happen 
here.
OK, so I set a goal for myself. 
Now came the hard part: accom­
plishing the goal. Let me tell you, 
it was not easy, especially when 
you have the kind of mother I do, 
one who makes sure the entire 
community is aware of my “spe­
cial needs,” as she loves to call 
them (lip-reading, note-takers, 
etc.).
I was bent on taking care of the 
situation by myself, so I could tell 
my mom what I did all by myself, 
hoping she would start to let go 
and not nag as much. I was scared 
to death. Fortunately, none of the 
professors gave me a hard time, 
but one of them just didn’t seem 
to care, and I was having a lot of 
trouble understanding him. I 
knew that this would continue 
until I did something about it, but 
I was too chicken to go up to him 
a second time. Finally, when I 
couldn’t take it anymore, I ap­
proached him and firmly told him 
he was not helping me out at all. 
How many of you have actually 
told your teachers off? I can’t say 
I had the best time doing it, but 
I’ll do it again if I have to. After 
all, it’s the nagging that keeps 
them going. I think I’m starting 
to act more like my mother these 
days.
I suppose the hardest part about 
my being here is that I cannot use 
the phone too well, and therefore 
must make most of my contacts in 
person. I never knew my legs could 
carry me so far in just one day. I 
also never knew I could force 
myself to remain calm after I made 
unnecessary trips to goodness 
knows where. I must have about 
seven blisters right now, and this
is just the beginning. But I don’t letting me grow up. 
mind them all that much. After
all, I’m the one who’s in charge of Sue Abrams is a freshman in 
my life now, and enjoying it. I H&SS. This is her first column

Oh, what to do with a law that no one is breaking
«Congress has been hard at work 
trying to come up with a constitu­
tional amendment that makes it 
illegal to burn the American flag. 
It is a hot topic for legislation 
because it could be the only issue 
in the upcoming elections. This is 
particularly true since there has 
been no movement in Congress 
on any other issues.
Campaign managers are now 
hard at work thinking of ways to 
make their candidate’s opponents 
look like flag abusers. The obvi­
ous television commercial is a 
burning flag in the street with a 
voice-over saying, “Walt Walle- 
meer couldn’t care less that some­
one set fire to your flag. It’s no 
surprise since flag burning is 
something he has practiced since 
he got into politics.”
Make no mistake about it. The 
campaign is going to get dirty and 
Old Glory is going to be the issue.
There is one problem with all 
this. There has been no reported
F'w )vEsPpSr
flag-burning incident in the 
United States for two years.
When Jackal, who runs 
Cumbersome’s campaign, went to 
the TV station to buy some flag- 
burning film for a commercial, he 
was told no new footage existed.
Rothermere, the head of the 
station, told him, “Nobody seems 
to be burning flags these days. 
They are shooting people, stick­
ing them up, throwing rocks at 
each other, and setting fire to cars 
— but not to the flag. Our field 
producers have assured demon­
strators that if they burn the flag 
we’ll guarantee that their demon­
stration will get on the evening 
news, but we have yet to find 
anyone who will go to the trouble.”
Jackal said, “I can’t believe it. 
How can we pass a constitutional 
amendment against desecrating
the flag when no one will do it?” 
“You have a problem,” the sta­
tion manager admitted. “We have 
some footage of flag burning from 
the anti-VietNam War demon­
strations. But the color is faded 
and it looks dated.”
Jackal agreed. “That wouldn’t 
work because we want to show 
that flag burning is a clear and 
present danger.”
“We have shots of people into 
dope and arson and white-collar 
crime coming out of our ears. We 
even have groups hanging the vice 
president in effigy. We have pic­
tures of street gangs shooting 
automatic submachine guns, but 
for some reason we have no flag 
abusers on tape. This is a real 
surprise because you hear noth­
ing but speeches from politicians 
on flag burning.”
Jackal said, “We had the same 
problem during the Communist 
witch hunts. Everyone was 
against Communists but, we
There are consequences to being prosperous...

,.Problems at the school named

than figuring out what to give out

Because, in a room so full of

the struggle for perspective, the

those freshmen living in Centre 
Plaza. It doesn’t seem fair; be­
cause there’s no space for them on 
campus, they get plenty of space 
in their off-campus apartment. 
When I was a freshman, they 
found a space for me in my “closet” 
in Hamerschlag House.
When faced with these prob­
lems, other schools did the Ameri­
can thing — they moved to the 
suburbs. However, I don’t think 
any of us really want to go to 
school in Monroeville or Bethel 
Park. We simply need a place to 
put our stuff.
Maybe we should rent out one

When you lack perspective, why 
not go to a place that lacks any­

the environment mirrors your own

means, make a bee line for the 
door, and for a few hours forget 
about being screwed.

Art Buchwald writes for the L.A. 
Times Syndicate.
We could take all of the useless 
things we’ve accumulated around 
campus—Andrew workstations, 
the orange thing in front of Wean, 
and the trailers behind the Col­
lege of Fine Arts — and store 
them all there.
The other solution is to get more 
land, like acquiring Chatham 
College. After all, Chatham re­
ally is not much of a school. Hon­
estly, have you ever seen a self- 
proclaimed student from 
Chatham anytime other than a 
Friday or Saturday night? The 
field hockey team already prac­
tices up there, we could leave the 
team there and send H&SS and 
SUPA to join them.
I can hear the guys snickering 
—yes, absorbing Chatham would 
help with the male/female ratio 
problem, but I don’t really think 
that is a factor. Chatham is an all­
women’s school, which means that 
if the ladies are dating, they’re 
already seeing guys from Pitt or 
Carnegie Mellon; so nothing has 
really changed. Besides, the lack 
of space at CMU, not the lack of 
dates, is the problem I’m tackling 
today.
So, President Cyert, I ask you 
to extend the Capital Campaign. 
Raise funds for a leveraged buyout 
of Chatham College. I don’t want 
it for its women—I want it for its 
huge tracts of land.

Field Hockey wins one and loses one in first week of season
By MERRY WILSON
Tartan Staffwriter
The first week of play for the CMU 
Women’s Field Hockey team had its ups 
and downs. The Lady Tartans won one 
game and lost another this week, taking 
their win in the conference opener against 
Washington and Jefferson on Thursday, 
2-0. However, they lost to Hiram 7—3 on 
Saturday.
In the match against Washington and 
Jefferson, Carnegie Mellon dominated the 
game from the beginning, with a goal in 
the first half by Becky Powers on an assist 
by Lisa VanDermeer. The next goal was
scored in the second half by VanDermeer 
on an assist by Sue Moll.
A rain delay 10 minutes into the game 
forced both teams off the field. After a 
slight delay, the game was resumed. The 
poor conditions caused some visibility 
problems, but that didn’t stop the Lady 
Tartans. "We kept the ball at our end of the 
field pretty well," said Coach Laurie 
Parker.
Beating Hiram, however, was not in the. 
cards, despite Carnegie Mellon’s three 
goals against the Hiram defense. 
VanDemeer, DeniseViscontiandMollgave 
Carnegie Mellon its three, with an assist 
by Christy Shea.
Thanks to some saves on the part of 
goalie Maureen Shea, the Lady Tartans 
were spared more goals scored on them.
According to Moll, the loss on Saturday 
was not enough to dampen the team’s 
spirits. “Even though we lost one game, 
we’re still excited about the way we played,” 
said Moll. “We have a lot of team spirit.” 
Parker was pleased with the game on 
Saturday, but sees room for improvement. 
“We did a lot of things right, but there’s 
still a lot we need to work on,” she said. 
“Overall the team did well.”
According to Parker, the team has been 
playing well, and she sees some definite 
improvement in her team.
Moll believes the team is in for a 
more successful year this season. 
“We’re much better than last year,” 
she said. Moll cited two reasons for 
this improvement. Experience is a 
major factor, as well as the 17 players 
on the roster this year, several more 
than last year. “This is the biggest 
team we’ve had in a while,” said Moll.
Parker is pleased with the way the 
players relate to one another. Moll 
also said the team is blessed with a 
lot of unity this year.
Today at 4:30 pm Carnegie Mellon 
will host its second conference game 
against Bethany at Chatham College.

When the first baseball cards 
? were made almost one hundred 
years ago, they were premiums 
one got with a pack of ciga­
rettes.
Just like the game of baseball 
itself, baseball cards evolved 
^liover time into an important 
piece of America’s cultural pie.
What was once a painting on 
the back of a pack of Lucky 
Strikes is now a tiny encapsula­
tion of a ballplayer’s entire 
I career.
The best thing about having a 
card collection is that you are 
! able to compare your collection 
¦to those of your friends. What a 
! triumph it is to pull out a card 
J with the 1975 World Series 
i Champion Reds, while the rest 
i of your friends scramble to see if 
j they even have a Rose or a 
| Bench.
Then, test your skill by flip­
ping the cards into a hat from 
across the room. The best one to 
do this might walk away with 
half of another guy’s collection. 
But that was all right, all the 
loser had to do was go and bum 
a quarter off of dad and go buy 
another pack of cards.
| Before the days of the great 
I Sports Illustrated Baseball En- 
; cyclopedia, all we had were the 
cards for players stats. Collect­
ing was always cheap, easy, and 
above all, fun.
However, baseball cards are 
no longer cheap, collecting is 
anything but easy, and the 
prime motivator is no longer 
fun. Cards are now invest- 
j ments; they are regarded as 
jj coldly and as blandly as stocks 
and bonds.
My friend Nikki recently men- 
i tioned that she had some cards 
| that she had collected when she 
• was younger. We decided to get 
f them apprised.I
We found a small shop in the 
city. Inside were large cases 
with cards encased in solid 
glass. There were chandeliers 
un the ceiling and plush carpet 
on the floor.
Now we both knew that we 
had some pretty “hot” cards — 
Pete Rose’s rookie year, Nolan 
Ryan and Tom Seaver on the 
same card, and even a Thurmon 
Munson.
A man wearing an Armani 
suit stood behind the counter. I 
warily went up to him and 
asked if he would look at some 
cards for us.
i Nikki produced the cards out 
of her purse. The guy recoiled in 
terror.
“You’re carrying them around 
like that!” he cried. “Why don’t 
you have a case like one of 
these?” He indicated a display 
of leather cases with special 
holding slots for the cards.
I picked out a few of the 
cards.
“These just aren’t up to par,” 
he said. “They just aren’t worth 
f much at all.”
Shocked, I asked why.
“Well for one thing, they 
aren’t old enough. And even 
i then, only the stars like Mantle 
or DiMaggio. Second of all,
) these cards are in horrible 
! condition.”
I looked at those on the 
I counter. They were all free of 
wrinkles and cracks.
We left. I told her to hang on 
(to those cards. They will be 
worth more to fans like us in an 
old shoe box than to some clown 
who would put them in a glass 
case.

The men’s cross country team 
was the top Division III team at 
the Indiana University of Penn­
sylvania Invitational Saturday. 
The Tartans placed fourth over­
all behind only Division I teams.
The University ofVirginia won 
the meet with 27 points, followed 
by Slippery Rock with 99, and 
Indiana University of Pennsyl­
vania with 112. Carnegie Mel­
lon finished close behind IUP 
with 115.
It was basically a four team 
race, said Head Coach Gary 
Meckley; the fifth place team 
was almost 80 points behind Car­
negie Mellon.
The Tartans ran an excep­
tional race through IUP’s wet 
and muddy course.
Leading the Tartans was their 
co-captain, senior Dave Supp, 
finishing a remarkable fourth 
place overall, behind only Divi­
sion I runners. Supp has been 
running consistently well this 
season, winning the first two 
dual meets of the year and keep­
ing up with Division I runners. 
He said he was pleased with his 
race on Saturday, stating that
Most of the team prefers running in 
the rain than with the humidity. The

times> but they are still considerably 
fast for this time of the season.
his times are much faster than last 
year at this time.
Also helping the Tartans defeat 
all of theDivision III teams was 
junior Gary Harrison placing 22nd 
overall in 27:34, which is much 
higher than he placed last year at 
the Invitational. For most of the 
race, Harrison ran with teammate 
Len O’ Neal. O’Neal placed 23rd, 
only four seconds behind Harrison.
The next runners for Carnegie 
Mellon were sophomore Russ 
Shorkey placing 25th in 27:46, 
sophomore Jon Frieder in 28:05, 
senior Gary Meeker in 28:06 and 
sophomore John Byrnes in 28:09.
Last year the Tartans placed 6th 
overall at the Invitational and were 
very pleased with their perform­
ance on Saturday. Coach Meckley 
said that it was the best that they 
had ever run against Indiana Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania.
The course consisted of grass, 
pavement and finally ended on a 
clay horse track. It was slippery 
and muddy since it rained most of 
the day—quite a contrast to last 
week’s unusually hot day on their 
home course at Schenley Park.
Most of the team prefers run­
ning in the rain than with the hu­
midity. The rainy weather always 
slows down the times, but they 
are still considerably fast for this 
time of the season.
This week’s meet was encour­
aging for what can be accom­
plished in the rest of the season, 
as the Tartan’s began to show 
their true potential. H‘
Next week, Carnegie Mellbn 
will be competing against Slip­

Women’s cross country places second at Allegheny
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
For the women’s cross country 
team, a trip to Allegheny College 
turned out to be a pleasant sur­
prise.
Heading into the Allegheny 
tournament, the Lady Tartans 
had their hopes placed on a lower 
finish. However, they underesti­
mated themselves, turning in a 
second place finish out ofl 1 teams, 
behind the host Allegheny in first.
“We were really happy and 
surprised; we only expected third 
or fourth,” said runner Tracy 
Howard.
However, the team just edged 
into second place, beating the 
third place team by three points 
and the fourth place team by six 
points. Despite the close call, Head 
Coach Dario Donatelli was still 
happy with the team’s perform­
ance.
“Overall, the team did really 
well,” said Donatelli. Although 
some of the individual runners 
did not have their best day, he 
said, “the others picked up the 
slack so we we able to get second.”
Out of 85 individual runners, 
CMU’s Carolyn Lowe finished 
sixth, followed by Sue Johnson in 
10th, Kristen Burgard in 12th
and Howard in 21st.
According to Donatelli, the 
Tartans’ fourth through 10th 
runners provide a good back­
ground to the top three runners, 
Lowe, Johnson and Burgard. “The 
depth pulled us through,” said 
Donatelli. “The freshmen helped 
out a lot too.”
Burgard believes the team’s 
surprise performance in the Al­
legheny tournament is indicative 
of better things to come this sea­
son. She also cited notable im­
provement since last year. “This 
time last year we probably would 
have gotten fourth place,” said 
Burgard.

CMU trounces Chicago, 35-8
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Copy Manager
CHICAGO — Different week, 
same game. One week after 
roughing up one University 
Athletic Association opponent, 
the Tartans turned around and 
did it again. This week’s victim 
was the University of Chicago in 
a 35-8 rout.
“We’re playing more up to our 
capabilities and we cut our mis­
takes down,” said Head Coach 
Rich Lackner. The win raised 
Carnegie Mellon’s record to 2-1, 
2-0 UAA; Chicago fell to 0-2, 
0-2 UAA.
It was yet another big week 
for the Tartan backfield, once 
again led by senior Scott Bam- 
yak. Bamyak had his second 
straight 100-yard game, and 
became the sixth Carnegie Mel­
lon running back to rush for more 
than 1000 career yards. All told,
the Tartans chewed out 269 yards 
against a porous Maroon defense.
However, unlike previous weeks, 
Carnegie Mellon did most of its 
scoring through the air. Quarter­
backs Billy Snyder and Steve 
Paterno hit three different receiv­
ers for touchdown strikes, while 
linebacker Robert O’Toole added 
another score by returning an inter­
ception for a touchdown.
“When the ground game works, 
the passing game will work,” said 
Lackner. The passing game had its 
best showing of the young season 
with 151 yards coming from the 
two quarterbacks.
The game started like the Tar­
tans’ first two games, with a touch­
down on the team’s first posses­
sion. The rushing attack steadily 
brought the ball upfield, with an 
18-yard scamper by Barnyak up 
the left side of the field putting the 
Tartans in scoring position.
Four plays later, Snyder found
tight end Marty Stovar for an 18- 
yard touchdown pass.
The Tartan defense held Chi­
cago in its first possession, but 
the special teams unit quickjly 
gave the Maroons another chance. 
Against Washington, CMU had 
had problems catching punts and 
kickoffs, these woes continued 
against Chicago.
Mike Beresford bobbled Joe 
Schein’s punt at midfield, giving 
the Maroons another chance. 
Chicago drove the ball down to 
the Tartan 25 on the legs of their 
halfbacks Brian Blitz and Matt 
Ficenic. However, the drive stalled 
when quarterback Joe Talanges 
could not find any open receivers 
on second or third downs. On 
fourth down, Talanges was sacked 
for a seven-yard loss, ending the 
threat.
The teams then traded drives, 
both looking tentative until mid­
continued on page 12

way through the second quarter 
when Barnyak busted the game 
open. The senior halfback found a 
huge hole on the right side of the 
Tartan line and exploded through 
it, racing down the side line for a 
43-yard touchdown run, and a 
14—0 Tartan lead.
O’Toole made it 21 -0 by picking 
off a Schein pass at the Maroon 39 
yard line and bringing the ball all 
the way into the end zone for the 
first defensive touchdown of the 
year.
The defense put in another fine 
performance, holding its third 
straight opponent to a single 
touchdown, sacking Chicago
quarterbacks Schein and Talen- 
gas six times, and intercepting 
three Maroon passes.
The only defensive breakdown 
came early in the third quarter. 
Chicago’s Darren Heil picked off 
a Paterno pass giving Chicago 
the ball near midfield. Blitz then 
took over for the Maroons, with 
carries of seven and 14 yards to 
get Chicago in scoring range. 
Schein then found Pete McGrath 
in the end zone for the touch­
down. The two reconnected on 
the conversion attempt, closing 
the game to 21-8.
Onepossessionlater, CMU put 
the game out of reach. Barnyak, 
Greg Marmol, and Drew Pizzurro
brought the ball into Maroon ter­
ritory. Patemo then hit a streak­
ing Josh Hvizdos for a 30-yard 
touchdown strike.
Later, Snyder threw another 
touchdown pass to Pizzurro to 
close out the scoring.
This week: The Tartans return 
to Mt. Lebanon to open their final 
President’s Athletic Conference 
season against the Bisons of Be­
thany College (O-^). Saturday, the 
Bisons lost to Duquesne Univer­
sity 21-17.
Last season, the Tartans beat 
the Bisons atBethany, 42-16. The 
rushing team of former Tartan 
fullback Chris Hansen and half­
back Scott Barnyak combined for
258 yards and four touchdowns in 
the rout.
This year’s Bethany team will 
depend on their all-PAC air at­
tack of honorable-mention QB 
Jamie Hamm, second-team WR 
Dan Reilly and honorable-men­
tion TE Cole Vulgamore to put 
points on the board. Last season, 
the Bisons led the PAC in passing 
yardage.
On the defensive side, the PAC’s 
second worst defense hopes to 
improve itself with all eleven 
starters returning.
Game time is at 2 pm. Buses 
will leave from Skibo starting at 
noon. The game will be broadcast 
on WRCT-FM (88.3) at 1:55 pm.

An away game is not just an­
other game. Saturday, the Tar­
tans were pitted against the 
Maroons in Chicago, in what 
turned out to be a major victory 
for Carnegie Mellon. But the ac­
tual play was only the final step 
in preparations that have been 
going on for the last four months.
As early as May, chief organ­
izer Joan Maser, the assistant 
cfirector of athletics, arranged the 
^scheduling of the flight through a 
travel agent at American Express, 
'the preparations continued until 
last week, when funds from the 
Cashier’s Office were allocated 
for snack money. Everyone re­
ceived $10 per person.
Departure from CMU took place 
from Donner Hall on Friday af­
ternoon. Two 46 passenger buses 
from Lincoln Coach Lines arrived 
to take the Tartans to the airport. 
A total of 77 people, including 55 
players, coaches, trainers, sup­
port people, and staff from WRCT 
and The Tartan went on the trip.
Besides the people, there was a 
considerable amount of equip­
ment to be taken care of. Physical 
Plant was given this responsibil­
ity, and on Friday, Physical Plant 
employees tugged 67 total pieces 
weighing a hefty 1222 pounds 
planeside, where they were im­
mediately loaded in yet another 
prior arrangement, this time with 
USAir.
Judging from reactions to last 
year’s travel to St. Louis, the 
players were excited about the 
Chicago trip. Steve Patemo, the 
Tartan quarterback, said CMU 
was “not sparing any expenses.”
Carnegie Mellonfs away games this year...
Having 60 hungry two hundred 
pound football players in the main 
restaurant of the Hilton would be 
quite a spectacle to the other 
guests. So through arrangements by 
the catering department, a separate 
room was set aside for dining.
Coach Rich Lackner agreed with 
him, enthusiastically stating that 
“everythingis first class, from the 
accommodation to the food.”
The Chicago expedition was no 
exception. Ground transporta­
tion in Chicago consisted of one 
41-passenger and one 47-passen- 
ger buses provided by CW Limou­
sine Service. From there, the 
group settled in at the grandiose 
Hilton at Hyde Park, about five to 
ten minutes away from the Uni­
versity of Chicago. A total of 39 
rooms were booked, two people 
per room (except for Coach 
Lackner’s private room). With 
paid TV, but with the phones off 
as well as the disallowance of room 
service. There was little chance 
for goofing off.
The last, but by no means least, 
aspect of the trip was feeding the 
Tartans. Having 60 hungry, two 
hundred pound football players 
in the main restaurant of the Hil­
ton would be quite a spectacle to 
the other guests. So through ar­
rangements by the catering de­
partment, a separate room was 
set aside for dining. A total of four 
meals were served: two break­
fasts, a dinner, and an evening 
snack.
The whole trip was not an all- 
work-and-no-play situation. Af­
ter the game on Saturday, the 
team ate at Ditka’s Restaurant, 
owned by Mike Ditka, coach of 
the Chicago Bears. Afterwards, 
players were given a chance "to 
explore the Windy City for two 
hours, before returning to the Hil­
ton.
Finally, back it was to the be­
loved campus of CMU on Sun­
day.
What did all this cost ? Round- 
trip fare was $208 per person. With 
the number of people involved, 
the mathematical mind calculates 
approximately $16,000 for the 
flight; the inclusion of food, lodg­
ing, and ground transportation 
brings the total to a healthy 
$30,000.

not just another game.

Football frats battle it out in IM play; rain cuts game short
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
The majors IM touch foot­
ball games started the year 
with the two football fraterni­
ties battling each other. Thurs­
day, Alpha Tau Omega met 
Beta Theta Pi on Flagstaff Hill 
to determine who has the bet­
ter team.
The game started as Beta re­
ceived the kickoff and gained 
a few yards on the return. The 
Beta quarterback, J.D. 
Heskamp, completed one of two 
passes and in the process got 
another first down. On the next 
play, Dan Mancini intercepted 
a Heskamp pass near the
Thursday, ATO met Beta on Flagstaff 
Hill to determine who has the better 
team.
endzone. On ATO’s first play of 
the day, the quarterback was 
sacked in the endzone to give 
Beta the early lead of 2-0.
Beta received another kick- 
off and three plays later had six 
more points on their side of the 
scoreboard. The point gaining 
play was made by Heskamp 
who ran the ball inforthe touch­
down. The extra point attempt 
was no good, so Beta led 8-0.
ATO started its second drive of the 
game with two consecutive comple­
tions, which led to the end of the first 
quarter. The second quarter com­
menced with the end of the ATO 
drive, which culminated in a touch­
down. A pass from the ATO quarter­
back to Scott Baciak was good for the 
six. The extra point attempt was good, 
with Mancini receiving the short pass.
The rain started to come down hard 
as Beta started its third drive of the
game. With the unwanted wa-; 
ter, the ball ended up getting 
slippery and several touchdown: 
passes, which would have been, 
caught in good weather, were 
dropped. Both ATO and Beta 
had trouble tryingto score addi­
tional points and the second 
quarter ended with Beta lead­
ing by 8-7.
The rain continued in a down­
pour and Assistant Intramural 
Director Mike Mastroianni de­
cided to postpone the games to 
prevent damage to the field. The 
rest of the ATO-Beta game will 
be rescheduled.

Two weeks ago, Carnegie 
Mellon had two Tartans cho­
sen: Dave Supp in men’s cross 
country and Carolyn Lowe in 
women’s cross country. Supp 
led the Tartans to a sweep of 
the first 11 places to give CMU 
its 100th consecutive win. Supp 
is one of the top distance run­
ners in the UAA. Lowe is also 
credited with leading the Tar-

ing the course in a time of 19:35.
This week, Rob Schaeffer was se­
lected for the men’s soccer offense

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
volleyball team came up on the 
losing side in five of six games 
this week in the Allegheny Col­
lege tournament. But the team 
believes that there is more to tell 
than what the scores show.
“We’ve made so much progress, 
considering that we had never 
played together before this sea­
son,” remarked freshman Heather 
Thompson. “It's tough to accept 
losing at first, but we pick each 
other up.”
The team remains confident on 
the heels of a 1-3 performance at 
the tournament held in Mead- 
ville this past weekend. Friday, 
the Tartans played Allegheny 
College, who took second in the 
Carnegie Mellon tournament last 
week.
Senior co-captain Laurie Shu­
maker said, “We expected a tough 
match from Allegheny because 
they’re really good and have a lot 
of people returning from last 
year.” However, the Lady Tar­
tans finished the first day at 0-2.
Saturday proved to be a better
day as the team matched up 
against Aurora and Shenandoah, 
the two remaining teams in Car­
negie Mellon’s five-team bracket.
The Aurora loss was followed 
by a two-game victory over Sh­
enandoah, as the Lady Tartans’ 
continuing improvement through­
out the tournament finally paid 
off.
In the other action of the week, 
the Lady Tartans lost matches 
against University of Pittsburgh 
at Johnstown and St. FranciB 
College.
In the other action of the week, 
the Lady Tartans lost matcheB 
against Pitt at Johnstown and St. 
Francis College.
The next challenge comes to­
day, as Carnegie Mellon travels 
to Bethany Collegein a game that 
some pi ay ers feeltobeakey point 
in the team’s development.
“It’s hard to say how well we’re 
going to do, but winning or losing 
is not the main issue. We’d like to 
win, but the main challenge will 
be to play well. If we can just keep 
on working hard and improving 
at our current pace, the rest of 
this season should just get better 
and better,” said Thompson.

Soccer splits games in Baltimore, beats Hiram

feBH .
feS The Tartan soccer team began 
;¦gan University Athletic Associa- 
Jlion play this week with a pair of 
“1 _ strong performances, but closed 
the week with a bitter loss due to 
a fluke goal.
“We were playing on turf and 
the ball had a lot of spin,” said 
Coach Nick Gaudioso. The goal 
went into CMU’s net off of a Tar­
tan defender to give rival Johns 
Hopkins a 1-0 win Sunday. The 
goal came with eight minutes left.
Saturday saw a better perform­
ance. J.R. Yakubisin scored two
second-half goals and the Tartan 
defense held Washington andLee 
scoreless until the game was 
almost over. The Tartans won,
2—1.
Wednesday, the Tartans out- 
shot Hiram 30-8 as Steve Gard­
ner and John Stivorivic scored to 
give the Tartans a 2-1 win.

.tory
By ERIKA L. PETERSON
Tartan Darkroom Manager
Just five minutes from 
campus you can bake in 
steamy tropical heat, take in 
the sweet fragrance of or­
chids, or escape the Pitts­
burgh rain by surrounding 
yourself with cacti in the 
desert.
Phipps Conservatory, our 
neighbor in Schenley Park, 
offers diverse habitats for 
plants from around the 
world, and for weather- 
weary Pittsburghers. It pro­
vides a wonderful opportu­
nity to wander through 
glades of rare and unusual 
plants interspersed with 
familiar flowers and tradi­
tional sculptures and a re­
laxing environment.
Designed by Lord & 
Burnham of Irvington-on- 
the-Hudson, the Conserva­
tory was built with a 
$110,000 gift from Henry 
Phipps. Uponits completion 
in 1893, it was the largest 
conservatory in the United 
States, with nine display 
rooms and a traditional Vic­
torian central palm court. 
The original plants in the 
conservatory were pur­
chased through public sub­
scriptions and donations. Af­
ter the 1894 Columbian Ex­
position in Chicago, the Con­
servatory purchased most of 
the rare plants displayed 
there. In 1896, Henry Phipps

donated an additional 
$30,000 to add three more 
display rooms. Finally, in 
1900, the City of Pittsburgh 
invested $35,000 in the nine 
growing houses located be­
hind the Conservatory.
The conservatory cur­
rently housesthirteen rooms 
coveringtwoandahalf acres, 
including the central palm 
court and twelve other rooms 
located in the east, south, 
and west wings. The palm 
court, a traditional feature 
of Victorian conservatories, 
contains mostly palms and 
cycads, some of which date 
from the 1894 Columbian 
Exposition purchases. Topi­
ary animals, including a 
llama and a lion, hide among
the huge trees.
Just off the central court 
to the west is Exhibition 
Room B, which houses a 
changing series of theme 
shows featuring various 
families of plants, different 
gardening techniques, or 
local arts integrated with the 
foliage. Following the path 
west, we reach the Fern 
Room, home to tree ferns, 
cycads, andgroundfems;the 
Orchid Room, a steamy col­
lection of bromeliads, bloom­
ing orchids and fish ponds; 
and the Stove Room, so called 
because it was built to house 
plants which required a 
higher temperature, and 
which now contains tropical 
and subtropical trees and
photo by Thomas Niphols 
other plants.
South of the central court 
we encounter first the Eco­
nomic Room, which displays 
plants important to 'the 
economies of tropical and 
subtropical regions; to the 
right of the Economic Room* 
we find the Cottage Room, 
which houses a cobblestone 
path, stream, and windmill 
surrounded by traditiona' 
mixed flowers and topiary; 
and to the leftof the Eco­
nomic Room, we find the 
Modern Room, which con: 
tains a changing display of 
contemporary gardening 
techniques and styles, as 
well as several permanent 
vines and large plants.

Happy lOOth anniversary; Schenley Park!

Right in our backyard, 
456 acres of forests, rec­
reational areas, picnic 
grounds, a swimming pool, 
a golf course, and an ice 
skating rink are virtually 
hiding. Schenley Park, 
Pittsburgh’s largest park, 
celebrates its 100th anni­
versary this year. And 
although official com­
memorative festivities 
took place earlier this sum­
mer, there are still plenty 
of way s to experience more 
of the park.
Schenley Park was ac­
quired by the city in 1889 
from Mary Schenley, an 
extremely wealthy society 
heiress. The city had
wanted to obtain the land to 
use as a park for some time 
in keeping with the civic 
parks movement which 
swept the nation during the 
1870s. In 1869, the Schen- 
leys offered to sell the lands 
to the city, but the proposal 
to buy the land was defeated 
bythe voters. Later,inl872, 
the city tried to obtain the 
lands by initiating con­
demnation procedures on the 
property, but this tactic was 
also defeated.
In 1889, Pittsburgh’s first 
director of public works 
Edward Manning Bigelow, 
learned that the Schenley’s 
real estate agent was eager 
to sell the property to devel­
opers. Eager himself to claim 
the land as a park, he jumped 
a steamer to London (where
Schenley was living), beat­
ing the real estate agent 
there by two days, and con­
vinced Schenley to donate 
the land to the city. The origi­
nal donation was of 300 
acres, with an option to buy 
120 more; the city took the 
option up immediately.
Various improvements 
have been made to the park 
over the years, includingthe 
building of Panther Hollow 
Drive in 1892, Phipps Con­
servatory in 1893, The Car­
negie in 1895, the excava­
tion of Flagstaff Hill and the 
construction of Panther 
Hollow Bridge in 1896, the 
construction of roads, trails, 
steps, and walks in 1908, 
Forbes Field and Panther 
Hollow Lake in 1909, horse 
stables in 1911 (destroyed
by fire in 1971), the carousel 
in 1913 (removed in the 
1940s), the tennis courts in 
1914, the swimming pool in 
1921, and the ice rink in 
1978. Many monuments and 
sculptures were also added 
over the years.
Schenley Park offers many 
recreational opportunities 
for students, from free ac­
tivities such as frisbee on 
Flagstaff Hill, long walks on 
the fairly well-maintained 
paths winding throughout 
the hilly park, more adven­
turous hikes along the 
streams runningthrough the 
extensive undeveloped sec­
tions of the park, to the inex­
pensive ice rink, swimming 
pool, Conservatory, mu­
seum, and golf course pro­
vided by the city.

Finally, in the east wing we 
find a second Exhibition Room, A; 
the Cactus Room, which houses a 
variety of succulents and other 
desert plants; the Broderie (mean­
ing embroidery) Room, which con­
tains a traditional 17th Century 
French garden of boxwood hedges 
and bedding flowers; the Japa­
nese Room, which holds a pond 
and a Japanese style garden; and 
the Victoria Room, home to huge 
tropical plants such as bananas, 
papayas, and waterilies floating 
on the central pond. This wing, 
however, is closed until Novem­
ber because of a $1 million reno­
vation project.
The foundation of the wing is 
being cleaned, and the structural 
bows of the structure are being 
completely rebuilt in aluminum 
and redwood, and will be laquered 
to match the original structure.
After renovation, four of the five 
rooms will be restored to their 
previous arrangements, while the 
Japanese garden is undergoing a 
complete restructuring. It will fea­
ture a design by a Japanese archi­
tect, and plants native to Japan.
The plants usually housed in 
the rooms under renovation have 
remained in place, and every ef­
fort possible is being made to 
maintain them during the con-

struction. Construction should 
be completed in time for the Fatj 
Flower Show on November 5th.
Adjacent to the conservatory on 
the west side is a large outdoor 
garden made up of six smaller 
garden areas: the Perennial Gar­
den, a collection of dwarf ever 
greens, the border gardens, theP. 
beds of annuals, a shade garden 
featuring local native plants, and 
the Medieval Herb Garden. In 
addition, tropical water lilies are 
displayed in a water garden dur. 
ing the summer months.
The Phipps staff of thirty full, 
time employees and fifty volun­
teers is responsible for maintain- 
ing the Conservatory, the out­
door gardens, the greenhouses 
and the beds in public parks ani 
around public buildings. Staff 
members are also on hand at the 
Conservatory and on the tele­
phone to answer questions about 
gardening and plants. Volunteers 
are coordinated by Phipps 
Friends, and information about 
volunteering at the Conservatory 
is available at 622-6958.
The Conservatory is open every 
day from 9 am-5 pm, and admis­
sion is $1 for city residents, e\U 
cept during the annual Fall, Holi­
day, and Spring Flower shows, 
when it is $2. The year’s Fall 
Flower show, which features 
thousands of chrysanthemums in 
400 varieties, will be held Nc 
vember 5—26, and should coincide 
with the re-opening of the east 
wing. Guided tours are available 
atl pm and 2 pm, Monday through 
Saturday, September to June,and 
special tours for groups of mor,* 
than eight, the blind, and the 
handicapped are available by

Children of alcoholics 
to have a support
group on campus
)u AUSON GREEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Increased awareness of sub­
stance abusein this country and 
how it affects friends and fam­
ily of an abuser have prompted 
the formation of many victim- 
help groups. As a result of an 
assembly last Monday in 
Doherty Hall dealing with the 
problems of life as an adult 
child of an alcoholic (ACOA), 
the Counseling Center is hop- 
ingtoform a new support group 
on the Carnegie Mellon cam­
pus for ACOAs.
The presentation, given by 
Susan Huckstein from St. 
Francis Medical Center, ad­
dressed the problems experi­
enced by ACOAs and how they 
can begin to find solutions for 
them. The group about to start 
on campus is being formed by 
two counselors from the Coun­
seling Center, Glen Sherman 
and Roseanne Hickey.
“Statistics show many fami­
lies experiencing difficulties 
related to chemical abuse, es­
pecially alcohol,” Hickey ex­
plained. Sherman and Hickey 
cited a figure in the book Let 
Go And Grow, stating that 
there are 28 million ACOAs in 
this country. The group is a 
response to a need that may 
exist on campus, and has as its 
main concern helping to allevi­
ate the personal and academic 
difficulties that ACOAs expe­
rience.
The group will officially be­
gin in mid-October. It will meet
for nine sessions, during which 
some films and books, includ­
ing Let Go And Grow, will be 
used to motivate discussion. 
Sherman and Hickey stress 
that the group will be com­
pletely confidential, and could 
provide an atmosphere in 
which students may feel a 
greater sense of trust.
ACOAs sometimes have dif­
ficulty in expressing their feel­
ings, especially when they are 
under a lot of pressure. They 
are overachievers, trying to 
live up to unrealistic expecta­
tions with regard to both aca­
demics and interpersonal re­
lationships. The members of 
the ACOA group will be en­
couraged to express them­
selves creatively, possibly 
through artwork or daily jour­
nal-keeping, as an outlet for 
the kinds of feelings they might 
not be willing to share.
According to Sherman and 
Hickey, none of the group’s 
members will be under any ob­
ligation to participate in all 
discussions; people should 
remember that the program 
is designed to help them to 
relax. “People need to know,” 
says Sherman, “thatthe group 
will provide an opportunity for 
all members to work at their 
own pace on the problems that 
they have encountered as adult 
children of alcoholics.”
Anyone interested in join­
ing ACOA should contact ei­
ther Glen Sherman or Rose­
anne Hickey at the Counsel­
ing Center, x2922.

Tune in, turn on, and drop out’ with Timothy Leary
By TERENCE SPIES
Tartan Staffwriter
In keeping with the tradition of 
previous campus speakers Hunter 
Thompson and Tom Wolfe, 60s 
icon Timothy Leary will be speak­
ing on campus Thursday. Leary, 
coiner of the famous phrase “Tune 
in, turn on, drop out,” will be 
speaking on “A Walk Through the 
20th Century.”
Leary’s primary claim to fame 
is his popularization of psyche­
delic drugs as a method of self- 
discovery. Before his discovery of 
psychedelic drugs in 1960, Leary 
was a successful behavioral psy­
chologist, holding positions at the
Kaiser Foundation Hospital in 
California and Harvard Univer­
sity. On a trip to Mexico, Leary 
ingested “magic mushrooms.” He 
says the experience changed his 
life.
According to Leary, “It was, 
above all and without question, 
the deepest religious experience 
of my life. I discoveredthat beauty, 
revelation, sensuality, the cellu­
lar history of the past, God, the 
Devil — all he inside my body, 
outside my mind.”
Leary then started conducting 
formal experiments at Harvard 
on the effects of the psychedelic 
mushrooms and their active in­
gredient, psilocybin. Experiments
includedadministeringpsilocybin 
to prison inmates to prevent re­
cidivism and the relationship 
between drug-induced states and 
religious experience. Naturally, 
some of his colleagues at Harvard 
were not impressed with his sub­
ject of research.
Next, Leary consulted with Al­
lan Ginsberg and other “Beats.” 
None of the Beats had experi­
enced the drug, and their experi­
ence convinced Leary that psy­
chedelic drugs were a force for 
personal and social change. To 
quote Leary in his 1968 book High 
Priest: “Politics, religion, econom­
ics, social structure, are shared 
states of consciousness. The cause
of social conflict is neurological. 
The cause is biochemical.”
By this time, Leary had been 
introduced to LSD, a psychedelic 
drug ahundred times as powerful 
as psilocybin. He started to popu­
larize the drug in the media, link­
ing it to sex and transcendental 
experience.
Eventually, Leary was arrested 
and sentenced to 20 years in 
prison for smuggling marijuana 
across the Mexican border. After 
leaving prison, Leary started lec­
turing on futuristic topics such as 
space exploration and human 
evolution.
In 1986, Leary founded a com­
puter software company, Futique
(a merging of the words “Future” 
and “Antique”), that produced a 
hit piece of personal computer 
software, Mind Mirror, a program 
which compiles psychological 
profiles. Other products of his 
company include Neuromancer, 
an interactive adventure game, 
and Mind Movies, a game cen­
tered around movie production.
Leary is the author of such 
tomes as the staid-sounding 
Multilevel Measurement of Inter­
personal Behavior and Start Your 
Own Religion to Starseed; Trans­
mitted from Folsom Prison. His 
latest book, an autobiography, is 
entitledFlashbacks. The subjects 
of his works range from straight­
ahead psychology to the future of 
man’s colonization of outer space.
Of course, a great deal of'his 
work centers on the subject of 
LSD, including the The Psyche- 
delic Experience:A Manual Based 
on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. 
Regrettably, only Flashbacks is 
available at Hunt Library, so 
those seeking Leary’s more out­
side creeds will have to search 
elsewhere.
Leary’s talk, entitled “A Walk 
Through the Twentieth Century,” 
is sponsored by Carnegie Mellon’s 
Political Speakers Forum Board. 
It will begin at 8 pm Thursday in 
the Skibo Ballroom. Admission is 
free.
PARSEC and S2F2A co-host second annual sci-fi conference
By SCOTT PAKIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Where do art, science, business, 
and literature converge? The 
answeris the second Annual Pitts­
burgh Science Fiction Conference, 
held in the University of 
Pittsburgh’s William Pitt Union 
on Saturday and Sunday. There 
were workshops, panels, poetry, 
speeches, music, art, and book 
sales, all centering around the 
themes of science fiction and fan­
tasy.
While at the conference, I first
walked through the dealers’room. 
There were a number of people 
selling science fiction and fantasy 
(SF&F) books, comics, posters, 
magazines and fanzines, T-shirts, 
stationary, and little buttons that, 
when pressed, blink little red 
lights. A sizable quantity of the 
material pertained to Star Trek, 
Dr. Who, and The Lord of the 
Rings.
SF&F literature, however, was 
not the only focus of the confer­
ence; one room was dedicated ex­
clusively to SF&F art. Side by 
side with works by such well-
known fantasy artists as Robin 
Wood (The People of Pern, cover of 
Dragon Magazine), were pieces 
by local artists such as CMU’s 
own Danny Fahs (Warped Imagi­
nation).
And if you’ve seen Star Wars, 
Close Encounters of the Third 
Kind, Blade Runner, or any other 
science fiction film, but possibly 
never read a single science fiction 
book, you could still have had a 
fun time at the conference. There 
was even a panel discussion called 
“Science Fiction & Fantasy 
Films.” The panel and the audi­
ence argued back and forth about 
the best and the worst SF&F films, 
how SF&F films have changed 
over the years, and how Holly­
wood has always made changes 
in the story line—usually for the 
worse — in hopes of selling more 
tickets.
Keeping with the lighthearted 
atmosphere of the conference, a 
panelist joked, “Hollywood said, 
‘Well, we need a girl here and a 
monkey here for fun, and we can’t 
do that zero-G stuff, so we’ll give 
them magnetic boots. Yeah.’ ”

The travelling Javi: Don’t forget the Q-tips and all-weather, tough-guy boots
By J. GRILLO-MARXUACH
Tartan Staffwriter
Author's note: This is the first in 
a series of weekly reports (depend­
ing on the mood of the British 
postal service) on the study abroad 
experience.
Packing is perhaps the most 
ego-shattering experience to 
whichlhave subjected myself this 
week.
After two years of packing 
everything I need for school into 
the back of my father’s car, I have
cultivated a pretty zen-untied-to- 
my-possesions-travel-light-go- 
anywhere-kind-of-guy self-image. 
This misconception was com­
pletely shattered when I discov­
ered that I had to pack my entire 
life into two duffel bags and a 
tape case.
Needless to say, the drum kit 
stays home this time around.
Now, don’t get me wrong. It’s 
not as if I have been sitting around 
chewing my fingers to the bone 
fretting about how many sweat­
ers I can pack into a “family 
pouch.” The problem I see is not 
packing what you need, but pack­
ing what other people believe you 
need.
The funny thing about visiting 
England is being subjected to the 
constellation of myths concern­
ing the English rain. When it 
comes to English rain, the fact 
that I weathered six Michigan 
winters in only sweaters and a 
pea coat seems to carry no weight. 
The usual speech sounds some­
thing like this:
“Well, my friend visited Eng­
land (I have become convinced 
that nobody really gets abroad, 
it’s always somebody’s friend,
which leads me to the conclusion 
that maybe only one person has 
ever gone abroad, but that one 
person has a lot of friends) and 
she says you need not just one 
umbrella, but two umbrellas! Yes, 
two umbrellas! In fact, she took 
three umbrellas — one of them 
was a supplemental umbrella and 
the other a spare supplemental 
umbrella — Take three umbrel­
las —YOU’LL NEED AT LEAST 
THAT MANY!!”
The other item that everybody 
is convinced I’m going to need is 
boots. All weather insulated boots
— tough boots, the kind of boots 
that can take the unspeakably 
rough punishment of the torren­
tial English rain! At- any rate, I 
finally bowed down to the peer 
pressure and found a pair of all- 
weather boots.
However, I will not go down 
quietly; let it be hereby known 
that it is my belief that all-weather 
boots are the most unspeakably 
hideous garment ever created by 
man. Not only does the sole look 
like chewed gum, but, most im­
portantly, the brand names of­
fend me.
To me, “Sporto” has always
been a derogatory term for high 
school jocks, and no one with an 
IQ higher than room tempera­
ture is going to believe that I am 
a seasoned woodsman just be­
cause the label on my boots reads 
“Northwoods” or “Timberland.” 
The second problem with pack­
ing is the fact that, as Americans, 
we are unable to believe that any 
other country has achieved the 
high level of sophistication in 
hygienic products that we enjoy 
every day.
Consider the case of a good 
friend (didn’t I tell you?) of mine 
who is currently, studying in 
Spain. After packing several bulk 
tons of Ivory soap into her suit­
case (the procedure involved the 
distortion of time and space 
worked on the inside of the suit­
case, I think; I wasn’t paying close 
attention at the time.), she was 
struck with the gravest pause. 
Slowly she turned her head to­
ward me, as if a revelation from 
the Almighty had become known 
to her. With the greatest concern, 
the following eight words escaped 
her lips:
“What if there are no Q-tips in 
Spain?”
Within minutes, we had ac­
quired enough Q-tips to cleanse 
every earlobe in Iberia for the 
next decade.
Personally, I’m not packing Q- 
tips. I’m confident that the Brit­
ish have caught up with us in 
cotton swab technology.
The third and most important 
consideration in packing is actu­
ally deciding how much empty 
space to leave for all of the souve­
nirs people have asked me to bring 
back for them.
Thus far, friends and relatives 
have asked me to bring back: five 
Savile Row suits, every British 
single Duran Duran has ever put 
out, a lock of hair from every actor 
and actress ever to have played 
on Dr. Who, an autographed pic­
ture of Dennis Thatcher, a Shet­
land pony, two wool sweaters, 
genuine highlander all-weather 
boots, five golden rings, the 
Beatles white album, Robert 
Plant, pictures from the Profumo 
sex scandal, hats with the word 
“BOY” printed in big block letters 
across the front, that little bag 
that Scottish men wear in front of 
their kilts, the BBC news at ten, 
and three dozen packets of, and I
quote, “Those delightful little 
biscuits I once had; I don’t re­
member what they were called or 
what they looked like, but you’ll 
know when you taste them.”
I’m just glad I’m not packing 
those Q-tips.
I suppose that, in the end, pack­
ing should be the least of , my 
worries. After all, I did hear that 
London is currently in the middle 
of a dry spell, one which has lasted 
for over a month now. Maybe now 
I can leave those hideous boots 
behind.
In any case, this is only !the 
beginning, and I will continue to 
report on the vicissitudes of an 
American Javi in London.
By the way, for those two of you 
who were wondering, the name of 
this column is now ... officially ... 
“Sex, Lies and Javi.”
The “name the column” contest 
we ran at the end of last semester 
turned out to be, indeed, a com­
plete resounding dud. The only 
entry we received was “Javi 
Trails,” which makes me sound 
like a hamster dwelling — so, 
“Sex, Lies and Javi” it is — after 
all... one out of three can’t be that 
bad.

Laurel Steinhice channels The Crystal Circle
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
“One of the fringe benefits of 
being dead is that you are every­
where,” Edgar Cayce, a psychic 
who has been dead for forty-four 
years, said last Saturday night as 
his spirit spoke through Laurel 
Steinhice, a channeler from Nash­
ville.
Steinhice says she became in­
terested in channeling at the age 
of twelve, when some of her friends 
got together and decided to have 
a seance. According to Steinhice, 
one of them was smart enough to 
fay a prayer before the seance, 
{hereby preventing negative en­
ergy from becoming part of the 
group. Several things, which she 
is unwilling to discuss, happened 
which dispelled her skepticism, 
j Her husband, who died several 
years ago, is her spirit guide. A 
Spirit guide protects the living in 
the spirit world; according to 
Steinhice, everyone has one: 
“Don’t ever say, ‘Is there anyone 
out there?’ You should say ‘Can I 
find my spirit guide?’ Everyone 
has one and yours will always be 
at leaston your level ofmaturity.”
According to Steinhice, her 
Jiusband Bill finds other spirits 
jso channel through her, spirits 
¡collectively known as The Crystal 
Circle. One member of the Circle 
5s Arthur Ford, a gifted channeler 
known internationally for his 
iwork until his death in 1971. The 
second spirit that communicated 
:to Steinhice was Edgar Cayce, 
;‘The Sleeping Prophet.” He died 
"in 1945, leaving behind volumes 
iof information on the study of the 
¦psychic. Other beings that com­
plete the circle include: Azrael, a 
light-being from the planet Yra-1 
'(in the Pleiades), Jhanan, a 
‘thoughtform manifestation ofthe 
IRA energies complex and Jung
Lao/Tsu Hsi, twin souls from the 
China of several centuries ago.
As Steinhice summoned the 
various Circle members, she 
closed her eyes and took several 
deep breaths. In a matter of sec­
onds, her eyes opened and her 
facial expressions and voice al­
tered considerably.
One spirit she summoned was 
Jhanan, the thoughtform mani­
festation of the RA energies com­
plex, who was the leader of the 
expedition that founded the col­
ony of Atlantis on this planet. 
Though Steinhice started speak­
ing in a foreign language, she 
then switched to English and 
greeted the audience: “Greetings. 
Good is Earth planet, like this 
one very much. Help this Earth 
place. Another friend come to talk 
to you.”
Steinhice became silent as the 
next spirit entered her—Azrael, 
the light-being from the planet 
Yra-1. Azrael spoke in a very high- 
pitched voice that sounded like a 
cartoon character. The being 
talked about crystals for a minute 
and then said “see you again, 
sometime, pretty soon.”
The last spirits to greet the 
audience were the twin souls of 
Jung Lao/Tsu Hsi. They explained 
that they were from the China of 
several centuries ago, “a time of 
great trouble and turmoil. Many 
people here with concern for 
China. To you, we say thanks on 
behalf of the China people. Free­
dom will not die in China or any­
where. We greet you warmly, 
perhaps speak again.”
The lecture was entitled “If we 
are all one, then who am I?” and 
Cayce went on to explain that 
everything is one. “In our one­
ness, there is great diversity. 
There is consciousness in the 
smallest particle.” Speaking with 
Steinhice’s voice, Cayce used the
analogy of a cell in a fingernail. 
“The cell is conscious and it un­
derstands that it is part of the 
larger being, or the person. We 
are the fingernail cell and the 
universe is our body.”
A CMU student asked the next 
few questions about truth and 
the validity of the New Age way of 
thinking. Through Steinhice, 
Cayce answered, “We look for­
ward to understanding.” He also 
felt responsible for those who 
believed in him.
The student then asked, if 
someone rejected what Cayce calls 
the truth, would they be living in 
falsehood? Through Steinhice, 
Cayce replied, “Perhaps. Butthey 
might come back to the truth. 
They might not be living in false­
hood, it might be misunderstand­
ing. What we have said tonight, 
we know to be the truth. People 
must feel the truth. In future,
people will come forward and say 
Edgar Cayce speaks through me. 
Some will be lying, some will be 
mistaken and some will be right. 
Why should you take our word for 
what we say?”
The student replied that he 
didn’t have the tools to find the 
truth. Cayce quickly answered 
“Oh, yes, you do. You must make 
value judgements all the time. 
Choose between good and evil. 
Try to find the light within your­
self.”
The discussion turned to recent 
investigations and books. 
Through Steinhice, Cayce gave 
steps on how to perform such 
activities as telepathy and look­
ing into your past lives. Accord­
ing to Cayce, computers will even­
tually be operated telepathically. 
To do this, “just place your fingers 
above the keyboard and direct 
energy to hit the keys. When you

get real adventurous, pull the 
plug.” As for looking into your 
past life, “close your eyes and take 
a deep breath. Pull yourself into 
yourself. Open your eyes and 
make observations.”
The evening ended with all but
one occupant of the room forming 
a circle and meditating. Steinhice 
opened her eyes and through her, 
Cayce said, “The force is with us.” 
Steinhice returned to full control 
ofher body and the evening's chan-, 
neling was over.
Science fiction finds large Pittsburgh following
EHoweovar —'HN Tz
Fun is what SF&F conferences 
are all about, says John Fiala, a 
sophomore math major at CMU 
and a member of SOLAR (an 
SF&F club loo sly affiliated with 
CMU), “I like to go to these [con­
ferences]; they’re fun.... I like get­
ting in touch with other people 
who think the way I do.”
And how does Fiala think? He 
likes to think optimistically about 
the future and to wonder “what 
if?” about the world around him. 
And thinking that way seems to 
be a motivating factor in getting 
into science fiction and maybe 
going to a few conferences.
People who enjoy SF&F some­
times travel long distances to go 
to conferences and conventions. 
At this conference, there were 
people who travelled from Ohio, 
West Virginia, Michigan, Phila-
delphia, Washington, and a 
number of other places to attend. 
According to Riley, who was one 
of the organizers for the confer­
ence, about a third of the conven­
tion crowd attend the University 
of Pittsburgh. The other two thirds 
of the people fit into the category 
of “miscellaneous,” including Car­
negie Mellon students. The ma­
jority of the people who showed 
up for the conference ranged in 
age from about seventeen to thirty 
years of age.
I did, however, meet one sixty- 
eight year old. Irene Tjerlund, 
who says that she used to wait all 
week to go to the movie theater to 
see the latest episode of Flash 
Gordon or Buck Rogers, told me 
that, “in the last twenty-five years, 
the outburst of science fiction has 
been tremendous.” She went on 
to say that science fiction has
changed a lot since her youth.
According to Tjerlund, contem­
porary science fiction writers use 
more imagination than their 
predecessors, and have been writ­
ing about newer, better, and more 
interesting technology. And Tjer­
lund would be the one to know 
about how science fiction has 
changed, as over the years she 
has accumulated a library of over 
three thousand science fiction 
books, representing all types and 
genres (but she doesn’t like read­
ing anything “with too much sex 
in it”).
Many science fiction readers se­
cretly or openly want to become 
science fiction writers. The con­
ference certainly didn’t leave out 
science fiction writer want-to-bes. 
During most of the day on Satur­
day, the convention organizers 
offered a writer’s workshop, in
which new writers got to read 
selections from their works, and 
authors and experts would cri­
tique the stories.
While I was there (reporting, 
not showing off a story), Phil Klass 
(aka William Tenn), the author of 
the famous short stories “Child’s 
Play” and “Alexander the Bait,” 
as well as many others, stopped 
by for awhile to see what was hap­
pening.
As the conference came to a 
close, I asked Riley if he had any 
special message for Carnegie 
Mellon science fiction enthusiasts. 
He replied, with a big grin on his 
face, “Think about us next Sep­
tember 15th and 16th.... We will 
be here next year.”
Erin Kelly, a conference atten­
dee who was listening nearby, 
interjected with the reminder, 
“You can walk here.”

Why are there so many CMU students 
who have yet to explore the Carnegie?
The many hours of homework could be 
a deterrent. Maybe the movies in Doherty 
2210 are unbelievably engaging. Or is it 
possible the myth is true — CMU stu­
dents have no social lives (gasp)? All 
kidding aside, it’s too bad more students 
don’t realize that one of the most enter­
taining and informative attractions in 
Pittsburgh is a mere five minute walk 
from campus.
The Carnegie Institute, located on 
Forbes Avenue, is composed of the Car­
negie Library of Pittsburgh, the Carne­
gie Museum of Art, the Carnegie Mu­
seum of Natural History, and the Carne­
gie Music Hall. All four are dedicated to 
the teaching and enjoyment of litera­
ture, art, science, and music.
History and Connections
Perhaps students at CMU would be 
more interested if they remembered how 
closely the Carnegie is tied in with Car­
negie Mellon’s past. They share the same 
creator, Andrew Carnegie.
So much to offer, and so close by, and 
yet many students have never visited 
the Carnegie, or are not even aware of 
Andrew Carnegie and his contributions.
“It is interesting how little some Car­
negie Mellon students know or care about 
Andrew Carnegie,” said CMU English 
Professor R. Jay Gangewere. “I once 
asked a CMU class what they knew about 
him and they said, “We know he liked to 
kill steel workers.’ [laughs] There’s an 
educational job to be done.”
Of course this does not only apply to 
CMU. There are students from Pitt and’ 
the area’s other colleges, andindeedmany 
members of the Pittsburgh community, 
who have never been to the Carnegie and 
know nothing of its history.
Gangewere talked about the history of 
the Carnegie. He is also the editor of 
Carnegie magazine, published bimonthly 
for members and friends of the Carnegie.
“Carnegie didn’t want a four-year 
school,” said Gangewere of Carnegie 
Tech. “He wanted a two-year technical
school... years later, the Board of Trus­
tees turned [the school] into a four-year 
college.” Hence, Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity.
The school that Carnegie founded 
became Carnegie Tech, and the first 
stages of the Caniegie we know today 
began with the creation of the Carnegie 
Library in 1895. In the early phases of 
construction, the library also served as 
the school library of “the Tech.”
The Carnegie Music Hall was also 
erected in 1895, and by 1896 the Pitts­
burgh Orchestra was performing regu­
lar concerts there. Visitors could take 
the trolley to the building and stay at the 
Hotel Schenley across the street.
In 1904 an enlargement of the building 
began. A temporary building was used to 
house the artwork meant for the art 
museum. A marvelous feature from the 
building’s creation was a set of towers, 
which were taken down when the front of 
the current structure was built.
“When I first got here,” said junior 
Chrissie Klocek, “I was impressed with 
the building itself, and the architecture, 
and especially the way the works of art 
were organized. When I found out [Im­
pressionist painter Claude] Monet was 
[included] there, it was my favorite mu­
seum from then on.”
According to Gangewere, the Carnegie 
is different from other museums in that 
it assembles everything together in one 
building; he said, “In the old days, put­
ting everything under one roof seemed 
logical.” While a larger city like New 
York separates its museums, the Carne­
gie has the benefit of existingin a smaller 
city with a central cultural ba3e.
The Carnegie Today
Today’s Carnegie is a vibrant and 
energetic institution, providing a cul­
tural landmark that holds its own against 
museums all over America. Its current 
projects and exhibits continue the tradi­
tion of excellence that is the hallmark of 
the Carnegie name.
The Carnegie Museum of Art eagerly 
awaits the arrival of Impressionism: 
Selections from Five American Museums, 
opening November 4 and showing until 
December 31. The exhibition will feature
85 paintings and sculptures by 21 Im­
pressionists and Post-Impressionists. It 
is being shown only at five participating 
museums.
The exhibition will include portraits 
by Manet, Degas, and Cassatt, and 
numerous classics, including Manet’s 
Portrait of Antonin Proust and Pissarro’s 
The Garden of Les Mathurins, Pontoise. 
A series of canvases by Cezanne, Seurat, 
Signac, Gauguin, and Van Gogh will also 
be presented.
From Dinosaurs to Minerals
From the Dinosaur Hall to the Hall; of 
Mammals, the Museum of Natural His­
tory seems to be the favorite of many 
visitors. Itfeatures approximately 10,000 
objects on display from all fields of natu­
ral history and anthropology. A special 
exhibition currently at the Museum of 
Natural History is Coins of the Carnegie, 
sponsored by the American Numismatic 
Association. The exhibition runs through 
October 15.
The latest addition to the Museum of; 
Natural History, the Benedum Hall of 
Geology, is possibly the most active area 
of the Museum. It encourages participa­
tion — one can touch screens and learn 
about the land in Pennsylvania, prèss 
buttons and learn about the composition 
of rocks and minerals, and lift flaps to 
identity fossils. At the center of the Hall 
is the Stratavator, a unique, simulated 
journey many miles underground, com­
plete with a tour guide.
One of the most beautiful areas of the 
Museum of Natural History is the Hill­
man Hall of Minerals and Gems, which 
will celebrate its tenth anniversary in 
1990. There are more than 2,000 min­
eral specimens on view, including rare or 
priceless gems and precious metals. “I 
really liked the Dinosaur Hall and the 
Hall of Minerals and Gems,” said junior 
Marvin Germany. “It was nice — a great 
break from school for a while. It really 
piqued my interest in different subjects."

Hackman can’t 
carry The Package
CHNNu Taa jHoaR !Sa—wI por Uaoa YpEANpo Rsp'a p Evg H— EH——aa Do wsa sHSr H— p Ep'tH gSpoa Do p REaoa —'HN The Package.
By TERRI KASCH
Tartan Staffwriter
The Package is advertised as a 
suspense thriller starring Gene 
Hackman, Joanna Cassidy, and 
Tommy Lee Jones. Not true! Yes, 
if you go to watch this film you 
will see quite a bit of Hackman 
and Cassidy, but be warned that 
Tommy Lee Jones graces the 
screen for only about fifteen 
minutes. This is tragic. Screen­
writer John Bishop, a Carnegie 
Mellon theater arts graduate, 
chooses to devote minimal time to 
his strongest character, played 
by Jones.
In the title role of the “package” 
that Sergeant Johnny Gallagher 
(Hackman) must transport from 
East Berlin to the states, Jones is 
the life-blood of this picture. When 
he appears, the movie sparkles. 
Jones steals the show with his 
brash cynicism and a disconcert­
ing smile that hasn’t been on 
screen since Bruce Dem’s turn as 
Norman Bates.
In his first scene, Jones spits 
insults and throws punches at 
fellow officers, who gladly turn 
him over to Gallagher. As far as 
Gallagher knows, his prisoner is 
Walter Henke, a man court-mar­
tialed for assaulting another offi­
cer in a bar. Yet, when Gallagher 
follows Henke into a bathroom at 
the Washington D.C. airport, two
thugs pummel him. When he re­
gains consciousness, his package 
haB given him the slip.
Gallagher quickly finds out that 
hiB package was not who he 
thought he was. The audience 
knows who the real Walter Henke 
is, because he appears in the 
movie. The U.S. Army sends the 
real officer Henke to Chicago to 
infiltrate a gang of Neo-Nazis. 
American intelligence believes 
that the Soviets are working 
through these skinheads in a plan 
to assassinate the President.
While Hackman could never 
deliver a bad performance, he can 
recreate the same role only so 
many times before the audience 
loses interest. Did you see Hack­
man in Hoosierst How about 
Uncommon Valor! Then you know 
what to expect from him in this 
picture.
The rest of the plot is so compli­
cated and confused that it hardly 
seems worth the effort of summa­
rizing, but here goes: The United 
States President and the Secre­
tary General of the Soviet Union 
have coordinated a visit to Chi­
cago where they will publicize the 
end of the Cold War and pose for 
pictures. However, this agree­
ment between the East and West 
does not send everyone dancing 
for joy. As Package director An­
drew Davis explains, “There are 
powerful people on both sides who
... have a vested interest in main­
taining a climate of fear, keeping 
their weapons, protecting their 
jobs. They are, presumably, not 
above conspiring with their ene­
mies.”
Meanwhile, Gallagher has to 
find out who his package is and 
where he has gone. In order to do 
this, he turns to his ex-wife Ei­
leen (Cassidy) for help. One of the 
bigger mysteries in this film is 
why these two ever got a divorce. 
Still-married couples should get 
along so well. Eileennot only helps
him, but she risks her life on sev­
eral occasions to do so.
The pair travels to Chicago to 
investigate a few leads and some­
how Eileen finds out that the 
package is really Thomas Boyette. 
Gallagher only manages to get 
himself framed for murder.
As if the plot is not confusing 
enough, the filmmakers felt com­
pelled to further disorient view­
ers with the scenery. When Gal­
lagher and Boyette supposedly 
land in Washington, Illinois resi­
dents and frequent flyers will
undoubtedly recognize Chicago’s 
distinctive O’Hare airport. Later 
on, when Gallagher moans about 
having to travel to Chicago, mur­
murs of “Isn’t he already in Chi­
cago?” buzzed through the thea­
ter.
So, the real question is: Who is 
Thomas Boyette? If you still care, 
then go ahead and see the film. 
The rest of you can be satisfied 
knowing that he, along with ev­
eryone else, is mixed-up in the 
conflict between those who want 
disarmament and those who pre­
fer the Cold War.
Co-producer Dennis Haggerty 
thoughtoftheideaforthisscreen- - 
play. Haggerty knew a Marine 
who, like Gallagher, acted as an 
escort for prisoners. The Marine 
mentioned that sometimes' a 
friendship would result from such 
a trip. Still, writer Bishop never, 
explores the relationship between 
Gallagher and Boyette. Everyone 
else in the film is either a comic 
book hero or an evil-to-the-core 
militaiy pawn. Don’t waste your 
time looking inside this package.
Explore museums, a library, and a music hall at the Carnegie
EHoweovar —'HN gpta TK
ful Music Hall. Even the foyer is 
elegant and breathtaking. The 
Hall provides seating for almost 
2,000 people. Today it plans its 
schedule around two sources: 
outside organizations that rent 
the Hall and the programming 
the Carnegie sets up itself.
Past tenants of the Hall have 
included Carnegie Mellon’s Greek 
Sing and the International Po­
etry Forum.
The new Performing Arts Of­
fice arranges for groups in the 
hall, as well as for events in the 
Lecture Hall and the Museum of 
Art Theatre. Local groups such as 
the Mendelssohn Choir and the 
River City Brass Band are regu­
lar attractions.
The latest addition to the Music 
Hall calendar is the arrival of the 
Y Music Series, with renowned 
cellist Yo-Yo Ma on the bill for the 
first concert, scheduled for last 
night. There will be a number of 
performances in the Y Music 
Series at the Music Hall through­
out the concert season.
Even the massive building on 
Forbes cannot hold everything. 
The Buhl Science Center, only a 
bus ride away at Allegheny 
Square, is a component of the 
Carnegie. It offers an exciting, 
challenging look into our world 
and the worlds around us through 
informative exhibits and sky 
shows. The Center also holds 
classes for children and adults, 
and features musical laser shows 
most weekends.
Educational Opportunities
A little-known feature of the 
multifaceted institution is the 
School of the Carnegie, which
—;Sh;D-FTn
HOMAMnAWAlJ rwweFîS6FCShi
N TIlE3aEGC *t\TH
(tfßöM $oaeiV
offers courses and lectures for 
adults in the arts, humanities, 
and natural history; classes for 
children and young adults in art 
and science; family workshops; 
and the Museum Studio, a pro­
gram of classeB and workshops 
for adults in art and art apprecia­
tion. Gangewere is quite proud of 
the expansion of classes at the 
School of the Carnegie. He said, 
“We are taking a more aggressive 
posture as an educational insti­
tution.”
A very important part of the 
School of the Carnegie is the 
Dance Alloy, Pittsburgh’s highly 
acclaimed professional modem 
dance company. The members of 
the company, as well as talented 
local dance professionals, teach a 
variety of dance classes for chil­
dren and adults.
The Carnegie also offers a wide 
variety of film and video pro­
grams, as well as tours of the 
museums and trips around the 
world. The 1990 foreign travel 
schedule includes trips to such 
places as Antarctica, Ireland, and 
Egypt.
Today the Carnegie is once 
again undergoing change. The 
entire exterior of the building will 
soon be cleaned. There may also 
be an effort to restore to the top of 
the building decorative elements 
such as heads, eagles, and lions 
that were taken down when the 
new roof was put on. Gangewere 
explained that “people will really 
be surprised as an old, black build­
ing becomes a very light color.”
The Carnegie is a living, breath­
ing cultural experience. Many 
students return to see an -area 
they missed the last time, or just 
to relive their favorite exhibits. 
Perhaps these students should 
encourage others to visit the 
museums, to browse through the 
library, or to hear some beautiful 
music.
One thing is certain. No new­
comer will walk away disap­
pointed; just a brief visit will leave 
you hungry for more.
Take the motto of the Carnegie 
to heart: “Explore all Four.” Then 
explore them again. And again. 
Call the Carnegie at 622-3131 for 
information.

Zombie puppets from Hell invade local drive-ins
As soon as you start writing in 
I the newspaper about people you 
know, you’re suddenly in deep 
dog doo-doo. Two weeks ago I 
I revealed publicly, for the first 
time, that Ugly-on-a-Stick was
* pregnant, and I haven’t had a 
good night’s rest since then. Two 
in the morning, I get phone calls. 
“Joe Bob, I want you to know 
that I am not the daddy of that 
ugly little fetus, and if you say 
5 I’m the father, I’ll sue you. In 
j fact, if you just think I’m the fa­
ther, I’ll sue you. In fact, if you’re 
thinking right now to yourself,
' ‘Maybe this guy’s the father,’ then 
I’ll sue your hiney from here to 
% Nairobi, Kenya.”
And then I’ll explain to em how 
it doesn’t matter who the daddy 
is, because Ugly-on-a-Stick 
I doesn’t care who it is, and even if 
she did care, they have these 
\ Genetic DNA Magic Mucus tests 
where they scrape some drool off 
the baby and they can tell exactly 
who spermatized the baby.
But that doesn’t satisfy em. 
“I’ll pay any amount of money 
I for the child’s support — baby 
facelift, whatever it might need
— but I do not want anything in 
the paper about it.”
At first, I thought they were all 
i embarrassed at the idea of hav- 
L mg a baby out of wedlock, then it 
f hit me what it was: these men had 
i all had actual sex with Ugly-on-a- 
Stick. Excuse me for a moment: 
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyaaa- 
aaaaaaaahhhhh!
All right, I can continue now. 
“It IS a pretty disgusting idea,” 
Ugly-on-a-Stick said when I told 
her about the phone calls. “I sure 
wouldn’t wanna have sex with 
me. And actually, that’s one of the 
best things about being me. It 
would be impossible for me to 
ever have sex with anything that
ugly-”
“Chloris,” I said ...
“Call me Ugly, Joe Bob.”
“Ugly, I’ve noticed you’re put­
ting on a few ounces around the 
ribs there. Might be time to go in 
and get a ...”
Fifteen minutes later, after I 
got really disgustingly sick from 
the thought of it, I finished the 
sentence.

“I hope we can find a boy doctor 
this time.” 
“Youknowbetterthanthat, Ug. 
All the male doctors refuse to 
examine you. There’s that one 
that worked in a Bolivian war 
zone, but he’s 94 now and I’m not 
sure it’s safe.”
“He was soooo sexy.”
“Listen, Ug, I think you’re gonna 
need one of those amnio-alphabet 
baby-scan radar videos. The deals 
where they take a picture of your 
baby while it’s still inside. That 
way they can tell whether it’s a 
normal baby or well, you know.” 
“You mean they’re still worried 
about a baby so ugly that he’ll kill 
me?”
“It’s not so much the ugliness 
that’ll kill you. It’s the idea of a 
normal eight-pound baby in your 
42-pound mother’s body. If you’re 
lucky, maybe the baby will be, 
like, three ounces. Then you’ll be 
very safe. Otherwise, Ugly-on-a-
Stick is gonna look like Soap-on- 
a-Rope. It’d also be a surefire way 
to tell whether you’re actually 
pregnant or whether this is what 
you call your hysterical preg­
nancy.”
“What’s a hysterical preg­
nancy?”
“That’s when you have sex with 
one of the Gonzalez brothers and 
you start thinking about what 
would happen if you were to give 
birth, and you get real hysteri- 
cal
“It’s probly not that,” said Ugly. 
“Why not?”
“Cause I’m uglier than all the 
Gonzalez brothers.”
“I hadn’t thought of it that way.” 
"They’re the ones that’d get 
hysterical.”
“They already have.”
“Let’s make a video of my amnio- 
alphabet,” Ugly told me. “I might 
want to release it in the theaters.” 
“Okay, but Jack Valenti isn’t 
gonna like it.”
Speaking of creatures almost 
as grotesque as Ugly-on-a-Stick, 
Puppet Master is the first zombie-

footsteps of Child’s Play, last

oooooooold,” learns how to do 
Egyptian voodoo on some pup­
pets and make them come alive. 
But then the Mafia comes to waste 
him and he has to hole em up in 
the wall of a hotel so nobody will 
find em after he’s dead.
Fifty years later and—whoops!
— a crazed psychic finds the 
puppets and discovers the Egyp­
tian voodoo secret and kills him­
self so he can come back as a 
zombie. This is what distinguishes 
Puppet Master from your run-of- 
the-mill zombie flick. Most zom­
bie movies, people are trying to 
explode the heads of the zombies. 
This one, everybody comes to the 
hotel to study the zombies, like 
scientists. There’s a whole pack of 
New Age channel-changers check­
ing in, hoping they’ll find out how 
to jump-start old pieces of furni­
ture, tumit into zombie material. 
But meanwhile, the puppets are 
starting to turn mean, specially 
this one that looks like a pinhead 
bodybuilder with arms like Swift’s 
Premium hamhocks. The best
thing about the Puppet Fu that’s 
about to befall every visitor to the 
hotel is that David Schmoeller, 
the drive-in director who also 
made The Seduction and 
Crawlspace, has created a special 
Zombie Puppet Cam that lets you 
see all the people die at Puppet 
Level! You see the beauty here? 
It’s one thing to say, “I wonder 
what it would look like if a puppet 
with a dentist’s drill in his head 
ran straight at your brain and 
just drilled his way right through.” 
But it’s another, entirely different 
thing when you say “What would 
the same thing look like if you 
were eight inches high and so all 
you could see was this enormous 
blood-spurting brain?”
Yeah, it’s that sick—one of the 
best of 89.

Pittsburgh’s jazz scene is bigger and better than ever
By JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Here’s your chance to get in on 
one of the hottest scenes in Pitts­
burgh. What is it, you ask? Why, 
it’s jazz, of course! Now don’t get 
me wrong; this isn’t New York 
City. The big names don’t play 
here every night of the week, but 
they do come around. Besides, 
the local players are definitely 
worth checking out.
Jazz isn’t just a Dixieland band 
playing “When the Saints Go 
Marching In,” or some real mel­
low sax being blown over a walk­
ing bass line. Jazz today can range 
from blazing bebop to modem go- 
go beats. There’s big band jazz 
(swing and otherwise — if you 
like George Gee, then this is your 
bag), bebop, hard bop, Dixieland, 
cool, jazz-rock fusion, jazz-pop 
fusion, etc.... the list is virtually 
endless.
Distinguishing Marks
So what distinguishes jazz from 
everything else, you ask? Simply 
put, improvisation is the heart of 
jazz. Through improvising on the 
song, the player is able to express 
himself and make the song some­
thing new. This is the excitement 
ofjazz.
If you are still hesitant about 
listening to jazz, then look at it 
this way; you probably have al­
ready heard some in the music 
that you listen to now. Sting’s last 
two albums, Dream of the Blue 
Turtles zndNothingLike the Sun, 
featured his renditions of a few 
.jazz tunes. In addition, his bands 
on both discs were primarily 
comprised of jazz musicians 
(Branford Marsalis and Kenny 
Kirkland in particular).
-Steely Dan is a rock oriented
Both Max 
Leake and 
Frank Cuni- 
mondo are ex­
cellent pianists, 
and Curtis 
Lundy is the 
city’s most excit­
ing bassist. For
band that is immersed in jazz; you fusion freaks, Tight Pockets, 
jazz players have appeared on RH Factor and Modem Times are 
almost every Steely Dan album, all excellent bands to see. For 
and the sound that makes this those that like it a little bluesier, 
band unique involves the use of check out Chismo Charles and
jazz chords and rhythms.
Jeff Beck, the respected rock 
guitarist, fused elements of jazz 
into his playing in the late seven­
ties and early eighties in his asso­
ciations withjazz keyboardist Jan 
Hammer and j azz bassist Stanley 
Clarke. Popular recording artist 
George Benson was and still is 
one of the best jazz guitarists in 
the world.
People to See
Now that I’ve got you inter­
ested, here’s the lowdown on jazz 
in the city. Joe Negri, veteran of 
Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood, is 
probably the best straight ahead 
jazz guitarist in Pittsburgh, 
though Ken Karsh can also work 
wonders on the fretboard. Randy 
Purcell, who happens to be CMU’s 
jazz ensemble leader and jazz 
improv teacher, is the best trom­
bone player in the city, though 
CMU graduate Mark Snyder is 
catching up. Mark plays in the 
Balcony Big Band and a few other 
groups, while Randy can usually 
be found heading his own group.
Eric Kloss, who teaches jazz or­
chestration here at CMU, has 19 
albums to his name. He is cer­
tainly the best saxophone player 
in the city, perhaps one of the best 
in the world.
the Blues Burners.
Places to Go
The Balcony, at 5520 Walnut 
Street in Shadyside (687-0110), 
has good jazz bands playing start­
ing around 9 every night of the 
week, and it occasionally gets a 
national act (recent performers 
were Phil Upchurch and Tommy 
Tedesco, both well known guitar­
ists). There’s no cover and you 
have your choice of sitting in the 
bar area or sitting down to din­
ner. (By the way, the Balcony’s 
shrimp pizza and blackened 
redfish are both very good.)
Clearwater has just opened up 
in Shadyside, located on the third 
floor of the Hartwell building, on 
the comer of Walnut and Aiken 
(621-8881). Brother Olive’s 
Lounge offers jazz to the Strip 
District, at the comer of 21st and 
Smallman (281-7670), while 
Cardillo’s Club Cafeis a good place 
to go on the South Side, located at 
56-58 South 12th Street (381- 
3777). The James Street Tavern 
offers jazz and excellent cuisine 
to the North Side, at 422 Fore­
land Street (323-2222), near the 
Allegheny General Hospital.
The Syria Mosque also has held 
some excellent jazz shows, the 
most recent of which was John
Scofield with Tania Maria. The 
Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild 
has a yearly series which brings 
in some of the best national art­
ists. Last year’s series included 
guitarists Joe Pass and Emily 
Remler, jazz dramming legend 
Max Roach, and trumpeter Dizzy 
Gillespie (one of the last of the 
great bebop players).
Though it usually showcases 
rock acts, Graffiti, located at 4615 
Baum Blvd (682-4210), has 
brought some excellent national 
jazz acts to Pittsburgh, such as 
John Scofield and Hiroshima. On 
September 28 the club welcomes
Taj Mahal, who happens to be one 
of the best blues traditionalists in 
the world today. Mahal is a virtu­
oso acoustic guitarist, pianist, bas­
sist, vocalist and general musi­
cian. Primarily a blues player, his 
musical scope also encompasses 
traditional African music, Car- 
ribean musical styles, and early 
jazz.
Finally, keep your ears tuned to 
WDUQ (90.5 FM) for great jazz 
plus information on the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh’s annual Jazz 
Seminar and concert. This event 
allows the public to hear a num­
ber of amazing jazz musicians
lecture and teach, plus those with 
tickets (which are about $9 if you V 
can get a Pitt student to buy them 
for you) can see the concert of a 
lifetime.
Well, I hope I’ve inspired you to 
go out and check out jazz in Pitts­
burgh. If you have any questions: 
you can call me at 422-3455. So 
for now, goodbye and remember: 
“Hot can be cool and cool can be 
hot and each can be both but hot 
or cool man, jazz is jazz” — Louis 
Armstrong.

Scotch ‘n’ Soda presents play
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon’s student the­
atrical group, Scotch ‘n’ Soda (S 
‘n’ S), will present Two Liberal 
Guys , starring Josh Ruben and 
Christian Matyi, Friday at 8 and 
9 pm in the Wherrett Room. Ad­
mission is free.
S‘n’ S is a theatrical organiza­
tion that is open to all members of 
the CMU community. Nancy 
Gleason, director of Two Liberal 
Guys, sees the organization as 
very important to the campus 
because, unlike the drama de­
partment, you don’t have to be a 
drama major to get involved. The 
more people who get involved the 
better because it’s all the more 
fun. Russell Lehrer, the assistant 
director of Two Liberal Guys, adds 
that S ‘n’ S is entirely ran by 
students.
Two Liberal Guys is a short, 
one act play starring Josh Ruben

Television season premieres offer little to excite the viewer
By ANDREW WHEELER
.Tartan Staffwriter
Yes, it’s that time of year again. 
The sky is filled with clouds, the 
temperature is dropping, leaves 
are falling, and another televi­
sion season is beginning.
So what’s the big deal? The 
networks are hoping to cover up 
the fact that this season’s crop of 
newcomers is one of the saddest 
in years. Most of the shows seem 
to be carbon copies of programs 
that were popular decades ago.
Fortunately, there are a few 
' bright spots among the fall pre­
mieres. Hopefully, this article will 
help you decide which shows 
might be worth a few minutes of 
your valuable time, and which 
shows you should seriously try to 
avoid. Unless noted, all times are 
in. the evening.
Comedy: Too Little, Too Late
There are twelve “new” come­
dies on the networks this year. 
“New” is in quotes because al­
though they claim to be new, most 
of them bear a frighteningly close 
resemblance to countless idiot 
sitcoms we’ve seen come and go.
Despite this, there are a few that 
catch the eye.
The Famous Teddy Z (Monday 
at 9:30, Ch. 2) shows the most 
promise. Jon Cryer stars as a 23- 
year-old who becomes a famous 
talent agent literally overnight
— by punching a famous (and 
stubborn) actor in the stomach. 
Alex Rocco co-stars as slimy tal­
ent agent A1 Floss. This show has 
the advantage of a nice time slot
— right after the hit Murphy 
Brown.
Doogie Howser, M.D. (Wednes­
day at 9:30, Ch. 4) looks like a 
winner. Stephen Bochco of LA.
Law and St. Elsewhere fame 
brings us this show about the 
trials and tribulations of a six- 
teen-year-old doctor. Dr. “Doogie” 
graduated from Princeton and is 
now a resident at a major hospi­
tal. As farfetched as the premise 
may sound, I’m still looking for­
ward to the show.
Jackie Mason and Lynn 
Redgrave star in Chicken Soup 
(Tuesday at 9:30, Ch. 4), 
everyone’s pick to be the highest- 
rated new show (it has to be — it 
follows TV’s hottest show, Rose- 
anne). The plot looks pretty aver­
age: a romance between a Catho-
AB Concerts lacks musical sense
ByDANBEDWA
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Why is AB Concerts so far be­
hind the rest of the music world?
When you think about college 
i concerts, doesn’t something a bit 
! more adventurous than Southside 
Johnny come to mind? Theoreti­
cally, a college is supposed to teach 
something to the people wander­
ing around its campus, and while 
à concert is obviously not in the
¦ same instructive category as 
I Economics or Discursive Prac­
tices, why can’t AB Concerts fea-
: ture anything from the last few
¦ years that doesn’t have the public 
stamp of Top 40 approval?
Actually, that’s not completely 
true. AB doesn’t follow the charts 
that closely — could you name a 
' single Southside Johnny song 
before you went to the concert?
- Can you now? Did you go to the 
¦concert? Did anyone besides a 
handful of AB personnel really 
want to see Southside Johnny? 
Has anyone besides a handful of 
AB personnel ever heard of
Southside Johnny?
Now, some fratboy wiseacre is 
going to say that I’m contradict­
ing myself, that if nobody has 
ever heard of Southside Johnny, 
then it makes sense to expose the 
campus to a new artist. This 
sounds reasonable, until you visit 
any used record store in the city 
and find a batch of dusty old 
Southside Johnny albums. I re­
member a Southside Johnny song 
called “New Romeo” that came 
out some time during my sopho­
more year in high school, and 
that’s it. I guess I should be happy 
that AB has allowed me to relive 
that memorable year, but I can’t 
help thinking that the money that 
was spent to bring Southside
Johnny to campus 
could have been 
better spent on a 
better band, or at 
least on Joe 
Grushecky, Pitts­
burgh’s own ver­
sion of Southside 
Johnny, who is on 
a certifiable come­
back. (Hey, Rolling Stone said so, 
and who am I to argue with such 
an esteemed publication?)Atleast 
students could go see Grushecky 
some time in the future.
So, who should AB bringto cam­
pus?
(This is really doing AB’s job for 
them, but somebody is bound to 
gripe, so I’m saving them the 
trouble of thinking of all those 
multisyllabic words so that they 
can appear intelligent when they 
peck out their letter to the editor.)
Well, the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
have a new album out, so they’d 
probably be willing to make the 
trek from California to Pittsburgh. 
The B52s do too, and they live a 
lot closer. The The has a new
album, and an upcoming tour 
(theirfirstever, with Johnny Marr 
on guitar); Nirvana is still low- 
key enough to play for cheap; Tar 
Babies have a great ’70s funky 
sort of LP, and they live in Wis­
consin. There are scads of good 
bands that AB could bring to 
campus for cheap. Maybe AB 
Concerts should go look for them 
instead of dragging out the de­
crepit Classic Tracks bands that 
they seem to be most familiar 
with. Last year’s Fishbone con­
cert was a good, if unpublicized 
step forward, but Southside 
Johnny is a big step back.
Some shows you might check 
out, if you have energy left after 
that exciting AB Concert: The 
Flow Band will be at the Decade 
on Wednesday, the UK Subs and 
Half Life will be at the Electric 
Banana on Thursday, and Yel- 
lowman will be at Graffiti on 
Friday.

sional writing major and the

lie and a Jew, and the problems 
the relationship causes.
Now on to the not-so-good: Nutt 
House (Wednesday at 9:30, Ch. 
11) is basically an attempt to use 
Mel Brooks’ name in order to pass 
off a really dumb program. Har­
vey Kormann and Cloris Leach- 
man star in this comedy from 
Brooks and Alan Spencer (Sledge 
Hammer!). Like Spencer’s last 
show, this one looks more stupid 
than funny.
Free Spirit (Sunday at 8, Ch. 4) 
gets the Most Original Concept 
award: Corinne Bohrer stars as a 
housekeeper who’s also a witch. 
Gee, I wonder if she twitches her 
nose to use her magic powers.
Detective/Drama— Deja Vu
Two detective shows look fun, if 
not original. In Snoops (Friday at
8, Ch. 2), Tim Reid and Daphne 
Maxwell Reid play a rich hus- 
band-and-wife detective team. 
Sound familiar? Booker (Sunday 
at 7, Ch. 53), a spinoff of 21 Jump 
Street, focuses on the title charac­
ter (Richard Grieco) as he leaves 
the police force to become an in­
vestigator for a giant Japanese- 
owned corporation. Should be a 
hit with Jump Street fans.
ABC is hoping that the success 
of Lonesome Dove last year will 
translate into big ratings for its 
new western, The Young Riders 
(Thursday at 9, Ch. 4). It centers 
on the people who rode the Pony 
Express, includingyoungversions 
of Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill 
Hickok. This show has a tough 
fight, though, going against per­
ennial ratings winner Cheers on 
NBC and CBS’ contender (see 
below).
Top of the Hill (Thursday at 9, 
Ch. 2) is a political drama that 
looks at new Congressman Tho­
mas Bell (William Katt). He’s a
former beach bum who was 
pushed into office unexpectedly; 
in other words, on the outside he 
appears to be just a "pretty face.” 
Will the press and public take 
him seriously? Sounds a lot like 
the controversy surrounding a 
certain vice-president we ¿11 
know, doesn’t it?
Life Goes On (Sunday at 7, Ch. 
4) may very well turn out to be 
Tear-Jerker ofthe Year. The shbw 
focuses on a family with an eight­
een-year-old son who has Down’s 
syndrome. “Corky” (played by 
Chris Burke, a 23-year-old with 
the disease) is being main­
streamed into public school. The 
show promises to be honest and 
open about the problems and joys 
the family experiences.
Science Fiction
There’s not too much “out there” 
for sci-fi fans this year. The only 
new show is Alien Nation (Mon­
day at 9, Ch. 53), based on the film 
ofthe same name. Alien refugees 
try to assimilate themselves into 
human society. Gary Graham 
plays a human police detective 
who sticks up for the Newcomers 
against numerous hate groups.
Trekkies, take note: Repeats of 
Star Trek: The Next Generation 
will be shown Monday through 
Friday at 6 onCh. 22. The origiiial 
Star Trek, which was playing in 
that time slot, will probably be 
moved to the weekends. '' 1

Yes, Asians are by far the largest minority group on campus. But there are far too many 
stereotypes and too little understanding about Asians. It’s about time that there's a place you 
can turn to with all your questions.

FOCAL 
POINT
September 22, 1989 
This Friday 5 pm 
Adamson Wing, 
Baker Hall
What is FOCAL POINT?
It’s a group that wants to bring understanding 
for Asians on campus. We just got recognized by 
Senate, but we have exciting plans to host 
discussions, lectures, and social events that 
would help Asians get together as a whole, as 
well as act as a communication channel towards 
non-Asians.
For more details: send E-mail to @ha0a.
Forget the Polish 
jokes, it’s time to 
make fun of the 
Japanese
Why do you see 
Asian girls going out 
with non-Asian guys 
more than the other 
way around?
Is it Asian or 
Oriental?
Your parents prefer 
Chinese papers, but 
you’d prefer 
reading USA TODAY
Who said that all Asian girls are subservient and Asian guys 
are skinny wimps? Media has a lot to do with what you think 
of minorities, and Asians aren’t an exception. Everything 
from Bruce Lee to your local Chinese Cooking Show gives 
you an idea that all Asians are Kung-Fu experts and talk with 
a heavy accent. You can’t help thinking that way, but the fact 
is that this is not always true.
O.K., so you can’t help stereotyping everyone by their ethnic 
origin. But may be it’s a good idea to learn about how they 
really are. Whether you like making fun of certain ethnic 
cultures, or you simply don’t know about it all, opening up 
your mind can be the best thing you could do to yourself.
Are Asian guys unattractive to non-Asian girls? Or is that 
Asian girls don’t find Asian men attractive enough that they 
look for others.... Maybe the issue might be more compli­
cated than sexual attraction. Research said that Asian females 
rank themselves lowest in social status among Caucasians and 
Asians. Is this statistic true?
What’s the difference you might ask... Is it important that 
Asians are not to be called Oriental? How has the Western 
perception of Asian culture changed since many Asians have 
immigrated to the West?
Asians seem to suffer the most when it comes to generational 
and cultural gaps. The significant contrast betweeen the inter­
national student from China and the 3rd generation Chinese 
American is a chasm almost too far to cross.
Some of the things FOCAL POINT will 
be doing when you join.
Hold frequent discussions that will bring up 
issues that are specific to Asians as well as 
bringing a better understanding of Asians to 
non-Asians.
Help international students from Asian 
countries that might not be familiar with 
American cultures through academic and social 
support.
Promote Asian involvement on campus.
Take action on racial insensitivity before it 
becomes an evident problem.
Act as an overall coalition for all individual 
Asians and specific Asian organization.
Work with Asian communities in Pittsburgh.
Establish firm relationships with other ethnic 
and minority groups.

The Fountainhead
This 1949 release stars Gary Cooper (High Noon, 
Sergeant York) and Patricia Neal (Breakfast at Tiffany’s) 
in the movie version of Ayn Rand’s novel of the same 
name. Cooper plays Howard Roark, an architect so far 
ahead of his time that he is rejected by the general public. 
He must overcome ridicule from all sides in order to 
achieve the greatness that is his destiny. He also must 
struggle with his personal life in the romance with 
Dominique Francon (Neal). Many say the movie is not as 
good as the book, but how many are?

Heathers
This black comedy, the brainchild of first-time director 
and screenwriter Michael Lehmann, stars Winona Ryder 
(Beetlejuice, Great Balls of Fire!) and Christian Slater 
(The Legend of Billie Jean) as high school students in 
Ohio. Perhaps it doesn’t sound very original, but this 
movie goes beyond the norm in many ways. Despite the 
fact that it focuses on very serious issues such as murder 
and teenage suicide, it is hilariously funny. It provides a 
refreshingly original and slightly offbeat version of high 
school in the 1980s. The film is so unusual in its approach 
to teenage issues that it was shunned by the big studios 
and had to wait for independent release. At $1, it’s not to 
be missed.

Dead Ringers
Haute schlock director David Cronenberg takes 
liberties with film-goers’ thresholds of disgust and fear in 
this dark psycho-horror flick. The film focuses on the 
professional and private lives of twin gynecologists (both 
portrayed by J eremy Irons) who enjoy the fruits of popular 
practices and woman-swapping. The problems start when 
the brothers surreptitiously share the affections of a 
buxom actress, inevitably leading to blood, pain and 
creative use of gynecological instruments. The reviewer 
would not recommend the film to those who can’t bear the 
sight of blood and organs. However, if that sounds 
appealing, you will not be disappointed.

What’s Up Tiger Lily?
As Woody Allen himself explains it, Hollywood wanted 
him to make this “definitive spy picture” because of his 
reputation in the genre. “Death is my bread and danger 
my butter. No, no, danger is my bread...no, no, death and 
danger are my various breads and butters.” This he says 
after an introduction featuring Orientals wielding flame­
throwers and radial arm saws.
What Allen did was to film a traditional Japanese 
thriller featuring a cast of unknowns, then subsequently 
overdub a new plot — one involving a desperate search 
for the secret recipe for egg salad. As the villainous Wing 
Fat puts it, the recipe will produce “a salad so delicious 
you could plotz.” The protagonist, a libidinous spy named 
(Oy!) Phil Moskowitz, has a talent for pick up lines — 
“Would you like to see my collection of off-color Italian 
hand gestures?” — as well as a talent for fending off 
assailants with toilet paper.
Obviously this movie isn’t for the masses. The reviewer 
watched it after reading two chapters of psychology and 
an exhausting set of beer pong, which may give you a clue 
why it seemed so hilarious. His advice to you? Watch it in 
the same state.

CMU students will be offered a week-long oppor­
tunity to enjoy Driving Miss Daisy, Alfred Uhry’s 
Pulitzer prize-winning comedy, when it arrives in 
Pittsburgh next month. Playing, as the press re­
lease would have it, at “the beautiful Heinz Hair 
(presumably to distinguish it from a squalid Heinz j 
Hall down the street),Daisy will run from Tuesday, 
October 3, through Sunday, October 8.
The storyline of Daisy revolves around the comi­
cal yet poignantly touching 25-year relationship of 
an elderly, debilitated, wealthy Jewish widow, and 
Hoke Colebum, her personable black chauffeur, 
who is only slightly younger than she. Much of the 
play pertains to the asynchronous and often fren­
zied interactions between these two distinctly 
contrasting personalities.

Miss Daisy plays Heinz
EHoweovar —'HN gpta TJ”
Hoke spends his time carting 
the septuagenarian Miss Daisy 
around, enduring her eccen­
tricities and histrionics as she 
attempts to singlehandedly pro­
mote the stereotype of the petu­
lant backseat driver. Miss 
Daisy, on the other hand, is 
indignant and resentful of 
Hoke, identifying him with the 
state of helplessness she into 
which she was forced after an 
apocalyptic auto accident that 
robbedher of her ability to drive. 
As a result, Hoke becomes the 
dumpsite for her hostilities and 
spurts of anger.
As time trundles on, however, 
the two seemingly dichotomous 
characters find solace and 
friendship through the bonds 
of shared experience and inte­
gral similarities that leap across 
the rift of racial and class dif­
ferences (the tried-and-true I’m 
NotRappaport formula), result­
ing in a lasting and compas­
sionate love between the two.
Driving Miss Daisy features 
as the title character five-time 
Tony Award winner Julie An­
drews, whose roles in many 
diverse Broadway and Holly­
wood productions have earned 
her gobs of deserved renown 
and critical acclaim. Co-star­
ring as the tactful and deter­
mined chauffeur is the versa­
tile Brock Peters, whose list of 
achievements includes suc­
cesses as a writer, singer, and 
producer as well as an actor, 
both on stage and television; 
Also featured in the supporting 
role of Miss Daisy’s dutiful son 
is Stephen Root, who boasts an 
impressive Broadway career.
Tickets for Driving Miss 
Daisy are available through 
several major ticket outlets, as 
well as the Heinz Hall box of­
fice. Call 456-2670 for ticket 
information.
Forbes Gallery begins new shows
By JESSICA BEEVES
Special to The Tartan
After its annual period of sum­
mer hibernation, the Forbes Gal­
lery awoke and opened its doors 
to the public and the campus 
community Wednesday, Septem­
ber 6. The open show, which ran 
through the 11th of September, 
started off a season which is sure 
to bring many changes to the 
gallery.
The year began with some 
physicalissues in the gallery. The 
summer left the facilities with 
some substantial damage. The 
ceiling caved in due to water
New TV season has 
few stars, some duds
J EHoweovar —'HN gpta TJz
who used to co-host Real People 
(remember?) stars in his own show 
called (you guessed it) The Byron 
Allen Show (Saturday at 1 am, 
Ch. 11).
If you have cable, you’ve proba­
bly seen Remote Control. Now the 
weirdest game show ever is com­
ing to commercial TV (Sunday at 
7 am, Ch. 53). The contestants on 
this show know everything there 
^ is to know about Gilligan’s Is­
land, but they might have prob­
lems finding the U.S. on a map. 
At any rate, it’s fun to watch.
Television hits a new low with 
American Gladiators (Saturday 
at 5, Ch. 22). Muscle-bound men 
and women with names like 
Gemini, Zap, and Lace compete 
in events such the Human Can­
nonball, ending in a grueling fi­
nal round called the Eliminator. I 
wouldn’t be surprised to see 
9 screaming crowds and yelling 
matches between competitors.
Etcetera
“Reality” shows are in. With
* the success of such shows as A 
Current Affair andAmerica’s Most 
Wanted, several competitors are 
entering the field (six at last 
count). Featured in Pittsburgh 
will be Rescue: 911 (Tuesday at 8,
I Ch. 2) with William Shatner, and 
Crimewatch Tonight (Monday 
through Friday, 7:30, Ch. 22), 
starring former CBS newsman
Ike Pappas.
New family members are pop­
ping out all over. Characters are 
either pregnant or have a new 
baby on Newhart, Designing 
Women, Mr. Belvedere, ALF and 
The Cosby Show.
Repeats of popular prime-time 
shows are now shown weekday 
afternoons in Pittsburgh. In­
cluded are Who’s the Boss and 
Growing Pains (4—5, Ch. 4), High­
way to Heaven (5-6, Ch. 22), and 
Mr. Belvedere and Charles in 
Charge (6-7, Ch. 53). Brothers, a 
comedy from the creators of 
Cheers that has run on Showtime 
for several years, comes to Ch. 22 
weeknights at 7. And in its wis­
dom, Ch. 53 is pulling Family 
Ties to show that all-time classic, 
Mama’s Family (Monday through 
Friday at 7).
So there you have it: the new 
season at a glance. Kind of scary, 
isn’t it? Seriously, though, any 
one of the new shows could turn 
out to be a fantastic program (with 
the possible exceptions of Remote 
Control and American Gladi­
ators). And until that happens, 
we can always rely on the great 
shows that are already on: The 
Wonder Years, Murphy Brown, 
L.A. Law, Night Court. Remem­
ber that there is television worth 
watching: you just have to know 
where to look.

damage and the floor buckled to 
the point of being a safety hazard. 
After the initial shock wore off, 
work was done to repair the 
damage and get on with the busi­
ness of scheduling shows. A couple 
of coats of paint and a few work 
orders brought us to the point of 
being ready for our first student 
show reception. The reception 
took place Friday evening for the 
work of Sally Gehl and Sandra 
McRae.
Though we do not pretend to be 
able to please everyone, the Gal­
lery does have a lot to offer be­
sides art. For those who enjoy 
literature, the Champagne
Flights to the Dog Races take 
place on Wednesday evenings 
beginning September 27. These 
events bring poetry, short stories, 
fiction, and lots of interesting 
people together for evenings of 
reading and listening. Also in the 
near future is a show that has 
never been done before at the 
gallery — works from the design 
and architecture departments will 
be on display the week of October
4. This is an important step in in­
volving different groups, as in the 
past only art department students 
have shown at the gallery.
Other special events this year 
include our annual poster sale;
an arts and crafts fair, openlto 
anyone with crafts to sell, which 
will take place November^ 8 
through 14; and a performance 
art/happening to take place dur­
ing the week of December 13. 
There is much more in the works 
so look for advertisement on bul­
letin boards, in the school news­
papers and even on Andrew.; -
For information on upcoming 
shows, call the Forbes Gallery at 
268-2081. Gallery hours: 11 am-8 
pm Wednesday to Friday, 12 —7 
pm Saturday, 12-5 pm Sunday.

Pittsburgh Symphony features pianist Frager
By MICHAEL COLAIANNE & 
SCARLETT TOWNSEND
Tartan Staffwriters
Believe it or not, Pittsburgh is 
home to one of the world’s finest 
symphony orchestras. The Pitts­
burgh Symphony Orchestra, cur­
rently under the direction of 
maestro Lorin Maazel, is soon to 
embark upon a month-long tour 
of the Soviet Union. This week, 
Resident Conductor Andreas 
Delfs will lead the orchestra and 
guest pianist Malcolm Frager in 
the performance of Weber’s Pi­
ano Concerto No. 1 in C Major, 
Hindemith’s Symphonic Vari­
ations on Themes of Carl Maria 
von Weber, and the popular 
Enigma Variations, Opus 36, by 
Elgar.
In the Weber piano concerto, 
the composer has once again pre­
sented the pianist with a chal­
lenge. The opening movement 
alludes to a vocal melody with 
singing piano tones accompanied 
by strummed chords from the 
orchestra, while the finale de­
mands the dexterity of a virtuoso. 
This will be the Pittsburgh Sym­
phony Orchestra’s first perform­
ance of the piano concerto; the 
performance of the Hindemith 
Symphonic Metamorphosis will 
mark the Orchestra’s fifth since 
the work was composed in 1943.
Malcolm Frager is a world- 
famous pianist acclaimed for his 
sensitivity and technical finesse. 
He is one of the few pianists in the 
world to have performed the origi­
nal version of Tchaikovsky’s First 
Piano Concerto and Schuman’s 
A-minor Piano Concerto. He feels 
that these original versions “cap­
ture the Romantic Composers at
their most inspired.”
Beginninghis piano study when 
he was four years old, his first 
recital was given at age six, fol­
lowed four years later by his or­
chestral debut. He is the only 
pianist ever to win both the Edgar 
M. Leventritt Competition in New 
York and the Queen Elizabeth of 
Belgium International Piano 
Competition in Brussels. He is 
also a magna cum laude graduate 
of Columbia University with a 
major in Russian.
The Pittsburgh Symphony’s 
1989-90 season will also feature 
28 pre-concert conversations. 
These informal discussions, held 
one hour prior to selected per­
formances will feature leading 
composers, musicians, concert 
artists, conductors, and musical 
experts. Stephen Berwind of the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Society
said the purpose of the conversa­
tions is “to enhance the total 
Concert-going experience. The 
audience will enjoy the concert 
more because they know what to 
listen for.”
Before pianist Malcolm Frager’s 
performance, there will be a pre­
concert conversation. Jim Cun­
ningham, assistant station man­
ager of WQED-FM, will interview 
Frager. If you’re going to the 
Symphony, be sure to attend ;the 
pre-concert conversation. The 
discussion is open to all ticket 
holders and begins one hour p^ior 
to the performance.
Tickets are currently on sale at 
the Heinz Hall Box office or ,’can 
be charged by calling Tick- 
etCharge at (412)392-4900. The 
concerts are this Friday and Sat­
urday at 8:30 pm and Sunday at 
2:30 pm.
