iiv George 0. Myers
Carnegie annexed its fourth win 
of the season with a 40-8 victory 
over the Western Res'crve Red 
Cats of Cleveland. Literally shov­
ed about the field the first half, the 
Clevelanders were unable to do a 
thing, while thef Skibos raced up 
and down, scoring five touchdowns 
and making things in general look 
rather downheartening for the 
Cleveland crowd.
At the beginning of the second 
half, things brightened up a bit for 
them as Wally jerked the wiTifflc 
first team from the field of action 
and put in the second-string men. 
The rest of the game saw the ^for­
mer in the stands watching their 
teammates play, while they rested 
contentedly for the coming week­
end. The Red Cats saw their 
chance here and put up a game 
battle against the subs, which 
brought them a touchdown and a 
s.afety. It all came when Saxe 
threw a nice 35 yard pass to Fin­
negan, who in turn romp.cd over 
the goal line for Reserves’ only 
touchdown of the season. They 
annexed their other two points in 
the third period, when Goldberg 
stepped out of the end zone on a 
fake punt from his own goal line.
Graveno Stars
Johnny Graveno, former star of 
Cleveland East High, was the out­
standing star of the game,- and led 
the Tcch attack by scoring three of 
the five touchdowns in the first 
half. Johnny proved himself a 
true Carnegian, with his wide end 
runs and passes, as well as off 
tackle plunges.
The Skibos started the game off 
• with a bang. A nice pAss from 
Goldberg to “Slats” Flanagan net­
ted thirty yards, and then “Army" 
on the next play skirted left end 
for a touchdown. The next touch­
down came after Pete Flanagan 
made two long runs on triple 
passes and then dashed 25 yards to, 
cross the line. Drcshar’s kick was 
again wide, but Tcch was given 
the point bccausc Reserve was; off­
side.
^...£’ravcno was then injected intd 
the game in place of Anncntrout, 
who was hurt on a tackle. John­
ny proceeded to treat his home­
town folks to a bit of flashy foot­
work. -After a steady push down 
the field he romped around right 
end for a touchdown. Then after 
another steady march lie dove over 
tackle for his second score. His 
•hird came a few moments later 
cfore the first half ended, when, 
a long pass from Goldberg, lie 
in crossed the line.
Reserves Donation 
ftcr the first kickoff in tlye sec- 
half, Tech lost five yards in 
tries, and on the fourth play 
berg’s punt was blocked, a 
Cat recovering it on the Tcch 
•yard line. A change to score 
.i when Reserve was penalized 
ards for holding. However^ on 
next play, a pass from Berko- 
to Malone took the ball back 
a again to the Tcch two-yard

Football Dance
A new and peppy orchestra 
will add spice to the weekly 
football dance on Saturday, No­
vember 1, in the Union. The’ 
Six Krushinski Brothers’ Or­
chestra has been engaged. They 
have been heard over the radio^

New Use For Old Ketchup Bottles
Is Help To Mischievous Children
Parents-to-be! spare.the child and 
let the rod rot; that is, spare the 
child but give him something in­
teresting to do.
Miss Knight, trained in child 
psychology, might sliggcst picking 
labels off bottles (ketchup bottles 
preferred), or washing pots, giving 
the child constructive and instruc­
tive activity to keep it out of mis­
chief. Miss Knight did not specify 
as to age—perhaps some collcgc 
students might profit too—take this 
home and let your mother read it.
Each .child is an individual' prob­
lem, and Miss Knight counsels cer7 
tain activity that will fit in with 
the personality of the child. For 
instance she would not take a back­
ward “yes tti’am" girl, spank her 
and then give her some dishes to 
wash to teach her a moral lesson. 
And yet, (this is where MissJCnight 
uses all her training and wisdom) 
neither docs she drag a screaming
and kicking boy from under a table, 
and beat him; instead she wins his 
friendship—afterwards he forgets 
his stubborncss and becomes mal­
leable to discipline and good be­
havior.
Miss Knight made a statement 
that ought to make every one sit 
up and take notice: “No child is 
naturally or inherently mean; par­
ents make children what they arc.” 
(Bcfor.c this you never could blame 
anyone for being selfish about lend­
ing ties).
If the modern generation under­
stands and makes use of child 
psychology the succccding genera­
tion will riot be spoken of as "go­
ing to the dogs.” ' You recognize 
the appellate? And this supposed 
jazzy, mad, hurrying age is going 
to rear children for better health 
and happiness than ever before— 
this age can profit by the mistakes 
of parents as shown in their own 
persons.

MAGAZINE TO PUBLISH 
PROFESSORS’ REPORT
Four-Year Research Gives 
Varied Information 
on Chains
.. -----------------
/•vProfcssors Harold Thomas and 
J. M. Daniels of the Civil En­
gineering Department have recent­
ly completed their “Report on the 
Investigation on Annealing of 
Chains,” which will be published 
in the next issue of the National 
Safety Magazine. For the past four 
years they have been conducting 
research on this subject of im­
portance to every car owner, and 
have submitted their report to the 
National Safety Council, which 
recently met in Pittsburgh.
Since human life and property 
arc endangered by the use of fault}' 
chains, the recommendations sug­
gested in the report as results of 
the investigation may prove to be 
very valuable. These recommenda­
tions, describing simple tests for 
improperly annealed chains and sug- 
esting suitable, methods of anneal­
ing wrought iron and steel chains.
[ be submitted ’ to a special 
committee of the National Safety 
Council, and, if approved, they will 
become official recommendations 
and open to adoption by manufac­
turers.
In the coursc of the investiga­
tion various types of chains were 
subjected to fatigue, impact, tensite, 
hammering, tension, repeated load, 
and 'surfacing wearing tests, for 
which it was necessary to design 
and construct three special ma­
chines in the laboratories. An im­
portant conclusion reached is that

WESTINGHOUSE HEAD 
SUGGESTS BROADER 
ENGINEERING EDUCATION
Industry Demands High 
Qualification From 
Engineers
As one of the foremost technical 
schools in the country, Carnegie 
Tcch falls within the scope' of an 
address made by F. A. Merrick, 
President of the Wcstinghousc Elec­
tric'and“ Manufacturing Company, on 
“What the Electrical Manufacturing 
Industries Expect of the Technical 
Schools.”, Although this address was 
aimed at Elcctrical Engineering, it 
louchos the qualifications that all in­
dustries, demand of the technical 
school, graduates that enter them.
, The primary requirement of a 
graduate in any field is that he be 
thoroughly trained in fundamentals 
and analysis so that lie can success­
fully apply himself to practical prob­
lems. Most of the highly specialized 
training is gained in an apprentice­
ship that the engineer serves when 
lie is first employed as it would be 
impractical for the “schools to hav<J- 
courscs for each of the highly 
specialized phases of the industry. A 
basic training that wo*iild give a 
sufficient background (for any phase 
is highly essential.
Engineer Not Broad Enough
Mr. Merrick’s greatest criticism of 
the technical man is that he is 
lacking-in' human understanding and 
acquaintance with the world of af­
fairs. As a man taking a technical 
course has so little time .to seek such 
qualities,i the only remedy is to bring 
the opportunity to him. The best sug­
gestion seems to be that of providing 
a coursc of lectures requiring no 
work on the part of the student, be­
yond attendance. The speakers would 
be selected for their knowledge of 
the subjects and their ability to 
present them in an attractive manner. 
Such discussion of human affairs of 
the past and ¦ present,- with a view 
towards future trends would certainly 
be beneficial to the technical stu­
dents. .
Most of the technical departments 
have organized clubs which have 
speakers from representative indus­
tries give light on the industry and 
its problems. This is of great value 
in acquainting the student with what

WILL ELECT SECRETARY
‘Y’ Completes Tenth Year 
of^ Successful Work 
on Campus
The membership . drive of the Y. 
M. and Y. W. C. A. will elose the 
last of this week, ending two weeks 
of systematic campaigning under 
David Gcntcr and the solicitors in 
the four schools. The Y. M. C A. 
cabinet will hold a meeting tomorrow 
at 1:00 o’clock in the “Y” office to 
discuss the campaign, and to elect 
a cabinct secretary; Robert Klein, 
secretary last year, did not return 
to school this year. Solicitors are 
urged to finish their subscriptions and 
to turn the money in so that the 
campaign results may be quickly 
settled.
The “Y" stands for "A Conscious­
ness of Right Living" and for-de­
velopment of character. Ten years 
ago the “Y” was brought to Carnegie 
at the request 'of the students. Stu­
dent Council passed it and Admin­
istration approved. Although the 
campus' was already crowded with 
activities the “Y," by doing little 
tilings, left undone by other' organ­
izations, has risen to a leading place 
in activities. •
Some of the services fostered by 
the Y. W. C. A. and Y. M. C. A. 
which should involve the wholehearted 
backing, of the student body arc: 
(I) Cash checks on the campus, (2) 
•visit the sick, (3) supply radio out­
fits to the sick and injured, (4) give 
helpful Service to plcbcs in the form 
of a Big and Little Sister movement, 
by providing guides to locate rooms, 
by a Freshman Dinner, and by spon­
soring a Frcshrivan Corn Roast, (5) 
co-operates in the Institute Chapcl 
Service, (6) run stag3 and entertain­
ments, (7) assist students from 
foreign lands, (8) assume respopsi» 
bility for caps and gowns', (0) pro- 
vide blankets for Kiltie Band on colt! 
days, (10) introduce students to the 
churches of their choice regardless of 
crecd, (11) co-operate with the city 
Y. M. C. A. branches, (12) give 
Carnegie world-wide publicity by con­
tributing news to Y. M. C. A. pub­
lication, (13) have representatives in 
local, state and national Y. M. C. A.

Bovine Anatomy Vexes Curious
Plebe Applying Technical Knowledge
The four-cylindcr auto came into 
its own on \the Carnegie campus 
for one brief hour this week. Of 
that/¡same indefinite type which 
breeds prolifically on college cam­
puses, its nondescript Duco finish 
was enigmatically scarred with the 
symbols of the ancient, providing 
the uninitiated plebe with a puzzle 
at the outset.
Seeing the vehicle in its favorite 
haunt near Skibo, the plebe became 
curious about its viscera. He be­
gan to experiment. First he turned 
a lc\;cr, with no result. It must 
have been the. wrong one. He 
fiddled with another. Again noth­
ing happened. Nervously he tried 
several others. Since none of them 
responded, he became suspicious. 
Perhaps there was internal con­
fusion, rebellion within the ranks, 
but there was certainly nothing he 
could do abou.'. it.
He sat and looked—what were 
those four innocent-looking han­
dles? Perhaps the trouble lay there. 
He couldn’t lift the hood, and 
there seemed to be no way of 
cranking it. All lie could do was. 
to »wait patiently until the engine 
warmed up.
So wait he 'did—this plebe of the 
inquiring but un-mechanical species. 
He gave it a kick, and lo, the “it” 
was a “she," and the "¿lie” was a 
cow! “Bossic" turned reproachful 
brown eyes on the astonished boy, 
and emitted a mournful “moo.” 
Realizing his mistake, and dismayed 
by the indignant sounds from -Her 
Majesty, he fled precipitately, know­
ing that what was needed was a 
chauffer with a gallon or two of 
gas. Happily, a jpilkmaid with the. 
proverbial three legged stool and 
enough perception to right the 
status quo appeared.
Dr. Lowry Names 
Four Assistants 
For Coal Study
Dr. H. H. Lowry, director of the 
Coal Research Laboratory of Car­
negie Institute of Technology, has 
chosen four assistants in coal re­
search work. Each of these men 
will study a particular phase of 
coal and its use.. Dr. D. Roberts 
Harper, III, former associate pro­
fessor Of Physics at Union College, 
Schenectady, is especially interested 
in the energy relationships involved 
in the thermal decomposition of. 
coal.
Dr. J. F. Weiler, a graduate of 
John Hopkins' University and form­
erly of the research department 
of the Eagle Picker Lead Com­
pany, Joplin, Mo., will study the 
composition of coal. William B. 
Warren, who studied at the Uni­
versity of Wisconsin, and who 
holds degrees-from the University 
of 'California and «Columbia Uni­
versity, is specializing in the study 
of the mechanism of coking. The 
fourth scientist who 'will aid Dr. 
Lowry is Bernard Juetiner, a 
former research fellow in mining 
at Carnegie and graduate of the 
University of Bonn and the Col­
lege of Agriculture, Berlin, Ger­
many. He is interested in the 
study of high vacuum distillation- 
of coal.
Dean Green Will
Attend Conference
Dean Green will attdnd the tenth 
anniversary meeting of the Penn­
sylvania Association of Deans of 
Women which is being held at the 
Pcnn-Harris Hotel in Harrisburg 
from Octobcr 30 to 31.
The program will include a lunch­
eon, an address by Dr. Robert 
Bruerc of the J. C. Penny Founda­
tion, an afternoon business session, 
and a banquet at which Dr. Ralph 
Hetzcl and Dean Amos will speak. 
At the joint conference the fol­
lowing day Dr. Mary McConaughy

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN*TUESDAY. OCTOBER 28, 1930.
East Pittsburgh transmitting station, 
the water must be tested frequently 
to protect the tubes 'and the cooling 
system. Ordinary - city water cannot 
be used because it contains lime and 
other minerals which form harmful 
scale in the coils.
At the KDKA station this ultra- 
soft water is pumped to an outdoor 
cooling pool before going to the 
cooling coils and the tubes. Hot 
water coming from the station cir­
culatory system enters the pool 
through a fountain-like spray. After 
cooling in the pool, it is pumped 
through the same circuit again.
An idea of the cooling problem 
which was overcome may be., ob­
tained from the statement that ap­
proximately five tons of cooling 
water must be passed through the 
water jacket of the tube each' hour 
it is in' operation. This water cools 
the tube in the same maniicr as 
water in an automobile cools the 
motor. One hour's operation of the 
tube would heat enough water • to 
supply the domestic requirements of 
the average home for several weeks.
While of course AW-220 tubes 
will only be used to generate high 
.frequency power for radio stations, 
an appreciation of the power capacity 
of one of these tubes can perhaps 
best . be gained by a comparison 
with familiar household devices. For 
example, a similar amount of „power 
of the. kind distributed commercially 
would operate simultaneously four 
hundred toasters or flat irons. This, 
would also be the equivalent of- 
power required to light one thousand 
average'homes of five to six rooms' 
or the energy to operate two modern 
str,cet cars.
ADVISORY COACHYou Are Cordiayÿ ~ Invited 
to Make theDirectory Of 
Carnegie Clans
A new transmitting station of 
KDKA has been opened at Saxon- 
burg, the success of which will de­
pend upon innovation'in broadcast set 
design which has been developed by 
the radio and research, departments 
of1 the Westinghouse Electric ‘ Manu­
facturing Company.
Of these innovations, one of the 
most important is the new 200-kilo­
watt tube. This tube is not merely 
an enlarged edition of • a smaller 
tube, but is thoroughly engineered 
as a tube of larger size and of a 
distinctly novel design. The mere 
building of a larger tube following 
the style of the smaller type would 
not produce the results desired. The 
quality of output and the life of 
such- a tube would not be up to 
the desired standard.
The new tube, called the AW-220, 
is 72 inches in height,, has a dia­
meter of eight ; inches\and weighs 
60 pounds.
In its design engineers found one 
of their greatest -problems to be 
that of cooling the grid. This diffi­
culty has been overcome by 1. E. 
Mourmomtseff, Westinghouse research 
engineer, who has produced a tube 
of mechanical strength and 'sturdy- 
ness through a double end construc­
tion.
A modern water softening, system 
has , been installed for use in con­
nection with the cooling system for 
these gigantic vacuum tubes.
There is a , practical reason for 
¿this installation because these giant 
tubes are expensive and unless prop­
erly protected their useful life period 
is limited. Therefore, anything that 
can be done to increase their life 
constitutes a saving in costly re­
placements.

chief operator of the Westinghouse

Police reserves armed with tear 
gas bombs were necessary to quell 
a recent riot of Columbia students 
preceding tjic Dartmouth gtirrie. 
Windows in subway cars were 
broken, advertising cards torn 
down, and two hundred feet of 
fence surrounding the campus was 
destroyed. Automobiles were tip­
ped over, and an attempt to set 
one of them on fire was halted by 
the arrival of the police.;The Pen

A paradoxical argument is the re­
sult of trying to associate enroll­
ment figures witli facts on the 
business depression. Glenn Frank, 
president-of the'University of Wis­
consin, stated that studies, of en­
rollments show tliat periods of 
prosperity and depression -just 
about cancel each other. Prosperity, 
he claims, slows up registration, 
while depression increases the num­
ber of students. I-Ie cites the cases 
of the Universities of Virginia, 
Nebraska, Purdue, Miami and oth­
ers to back up his statement. His 
own school, Wisconsin, however, 
has suffered a decreased freshman 
class, and Registrar Holt gives 
many pathetic stories of students 
unable to attend or forced to re­
turn home'1 because of financial 
difficulties. He says that the Uni­
versities of Mississippi, Indiana and

The October skies are smiling—
The denuded trees arc bent and 
bowed,
The brown and golden open fields 
Smell of sweet scented hay, new 
mowed.
A blank what-hayc-you look on, 
the Freshman.
That P. & D. dcawing equipment

Old friends chatting in the halls.
Sweethearts waiting on the stone

The ever present boy-friend and

Necessity for an elevator to the

Bulletins of interest to Night 
Students in the halls.
Puppet salesmen at all doors, 
corners and nooks.
Fellowship between all four col­
leges.
The Plaid lias been receiving a 
large number of column article* 
which arc very good, but' because 
of the limited space available, it is 
impossible to publish these-articles 
in the form sent in, if at all.
Flic only official publication 
which the Night Student Council 
lias is its handbook. This hand­
book is published each year and 
its first official appearance is made
I he first regular registration night 
when it is distributed to the night 
students as they register. The 
editor of this handbook tries to 
serve the best interests of the 
night students and incorporates al! 
the material and information pos­
sible up to the time it goes to 
press.
If wc had a whole paper at our 
disposal, we would be more than 
pleased to run a number of col- 
iumns and publish all the informa­
tion concerning the night students, 
but since wc do not have an offi­
cial paper, and arc limited in space 
each week, wc arc forced to curtail 
in every way and make use of the 
official handbook wherever possi­
ble. Thq handbook is compiled 
during the summer and in this way 
it contains information which is 
impossible tp publish in the Plaid 
since the latter is not issued during 
the whole* year. 'Consequently, 
where any material appears in the. 
handbook and it does not appear 
in the Plaid, the publishing of this 
material in the' handbook suffices 
and it is interpreted as having been 
published, as. the night students 
are expected to read this hand­
book.
There is another feature which 
enters into the publishing of col­
umn articles and that is regularity. 
If a column is started, it must 
be consistently continued to be of 
any interest. Another thing which 
precludes the using of column ar­
ticles is that a page which con­
tained only this type of articles 
would become, uninteresting.
While, wc are on tlic subject we 
wish to call your attention to the 
fact that the Plaid has to be made 
up each week', and' that the. limit 
or dead line for making up the 
page is Friday evening of each 
week. Contributors will please 
bear this in mind when sending in 
articles and see that I hey! are 
mailed so that they reach the Plaid 
not later than Friday evening. 
T hey .. should . endeavor., to, ¡j; let ,115 
have them as early in the week as 
possible. |
We do not wish to curtail the 
receipt of contributions, will en­
courage you' all wc can, but we 
are interested most in receiving 
news articles rather than column 
articles.
November 1
On Monday evening, October 20, 
the Night College of Fine Arts held 
its annual meeting for the election 
of officers, and what a meeting 
it was.
Mr> Hoover, President of the Col­
lege introduced the President of the 
Night Student Council, Mr. James 
'H. Sansonetti, who took charge of 
the election for the evening. After 
a short speech outlining the import­
ance of the affair Mr. Sansonetti ex­
plained the qualifications a nominee 
must have to be a candidate for 
office. This brought a general dis­
cussion that reminded one of a good 
old fashioned political rail}'. Those 
good actors from the drama de­
partment furnished most of the fire­
works.' Charges' and counter-charges 
filled the air. Shouting added to the 
general din and in the midst of all 
stood President Sansonetti, perched 
on a table answering all questions. 
He reminded one of Horatus at the 
bridge. He succeeded finally in re­
gaining a semblance of order and 
started the election by asking for 
nominations for 'the various offices. 
This started another din, but the 
election went on. ’
Out of chaos emerged peace, out 
of confusion came order, and the 
Night College o!f Fine Arts had 
clcctcd four new officers, four men 
who arc 'to guide its destinies for 
the remainder of the school year, and 
we certainly wish them luck, they’ll 
need it. The four successful men 
were: Mr. Henry E. Mauro, presi­
dent; Mr. James J. Lcihdecker, vice 
president; Mr. Martin B. Hudalc, 
secretary, and Mr. Wilbur J. Fitz­
gerald, treasurer. Best of luck boys.
At the annual dinner of the 
metallurgical advisory board to the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
and the United States Bureau of 
Mines held recently, the needs of 
the automotive industry, for new 
and better types of steel for spe­
cific purposes was made clear.
Charles E. Wilson (Carnegie’09), 
gave several instances of the hand- 
in-hand growth of new metallur­
gical processes with the simultane­
ous growth of the automobile. He 
said: "Research work has brought 
vast improvement in steel making, 
the greater uniformity of steels for 
ball bearings and of alloyed steels 
for gears being important contribu­
tions.”
"Stainless steel and chromium 
plating developments also have 
helped greatly. .One thing wc need 
now is further advance in preven­
tion of rust and corrosion. An­
other special need is for develop­
ment of a satisfactory material for 
brake drums.” 1
Mr. Wilson is the vicc • presi­
dent of the G. M. C., and conse­
quently his words arc to be taken 
seriously, coming as they do, 
from a man who knows. Thi,s 
statement of specific needs will 
probably result in intensive re­
search on the part of many metal­
lurgists. some of whom arc Un­
doubtedly Night students at Car­
negie. Left’s give the boys a 
hand, and hope that it is a Car­
negie man who has a .part in the 
discovery of these new materials.

Saturday night is the time set 
for the Night Engineering Smoker. 
The men’i gymnasium has been se­
cured for this affair. The post­
ponement, was occasioned by the fact 
that the Union was not sccured for 
the date originally scheduled.
While the Plaid. does not have 
any specific particulars oh the af­
fair, it is presumed that all ar­
rangements have been made for a 
successful smoker, \vhich will in­
clude the usual entertainment and 
lunch.
At this time an election of the 
College of Engineering officers will 
be held and all night Engineering 
men arc urged to turn out to elect 
those men who will represent their 
college in the council, and prop­
erly look after their interests. This 
is the first time that the Engineer­
ing college has held its election on 
Saturday night and a large turn­
out it expected.
This smoker will give the new 
men an opportunity to relax a lit­
tle from the hard schedules which 
they are carrying and will also be 
the means of meeting some of 
their fellow students.
Be sure to mark this date now 
and be present at the Smoker on 
Saturday night, November 1, in the 
men’s gymnasium at 8:30.
As he returns homeward from hisI wonder who Gazzin A. Round 
is, I suppose he is one of those— 
(I say lie, because I don’t think 
it is a she) who wants to force 
ine to do something, and you know 
how I hate, to get busy.
Speaking of getting busy, I won­
der what has become of that school 
,strike, or, strikes, because there 
were several of them when the 
jiubli.c school system started work­
ing in the fall. Those youngsters 
certainly- had a lot of pluck, learn- 
ipg from others. Suppose they 
knew that a two-mile walk wa» 
farther than a one-mile walk, even
though one of the -------- said they
enjoyed the walk. T don’t sup­
pose, however, that these ------- peo­
ple would like to take ‘the walk 
day in and day out; I wouldn’t, 
I know. Guess that it is all set­
tled because I haven’t seen any no­
tice of it in the Pittsburgh dailies 
lately, at least not for three weeks. 
Here’s hoping the-youngsters won.

1 noticed from the papers that a 
mid-western college had to disband 
a local fraternity which was or­
ganized on their campus which 
consisted of bald-headed members.
I suppose they called it a bald fra­
ternity or something of that kind 
Membership in the organization 
more than likely was limited t<> 
men -with bald heads, because no 
tvoihen have reached that, stage, 
rite reason given was that the cn- 
•ollmcnt this year did not include 
t single bald head. Now that con- 
lition docs not exist at Carnegie 
L’cch, bccausc I notice a number 
.if bald-headed students from time 
;o time on our campus. I wonder 
,vhat this would signify. Maybe it 
,s that only the youngsters go to 
•.lie mid-western college, and that 
)ur night campus is made up of 
older men. At all events, if they 
,vant to start some such organiza­
tion here, I am open for Chartci 
membership, so that there will be 
no hair pulling contest.
Did you notice (apologies) how 
(oggy it was the last week in 
Pittsburgh. It is getting around to 
our usual time when a vsitor would 
be temple^ to sny "Smoky City." 
But he would be mistaken, bccausc 
we do have the sun some time. 
Speaking of fog and smoke, some­
time "ago 'I saw where the Depart­
ment of Agriculture in California 
declared the use of smudge, pots to 
prevent frost in orange and''.lemon 
groves a public nuisance, and that 
7n per cent of them were ineffi­
cient. These contraptions emit 
dense clouds of smoke and soot 
which endanger the health of the 
inhabitants as well as dirty tlieir 
clothing and households. Well, all
I can say is that J would like to 
have an orange and lemon, grove 
right here so that a ban could be 
nut on^moke emitting devices. 1

Too much cannot be said about 
the parking of autos on the cam­
pus. Two weeks ago we published 
the parking regulations that are in 
force on the campus at night. The 
streets and roadways., around the 
school 1 wl\ere parking is permitted 
are city streets and are subject 
to the same conditions as other 
city streets. This fact has been 
brought home to some who disre­
garded our warning and parked 
their cars where they had been 
told not to.
The fact that so many of tli- 
night students drive cars to school 
speaks well of the prosperity oi 
the average night student. Of 
course many of the men come, 
from great distances and to relv 
on the ordinary transportation sys­
tems, street cars and trains, would 
probably not get them home be­
fore breakfast. The parking regu­
lations and no parking signs that 
are in evidence about the campus 
have been placed there for the 
mutual good of all concerned and 
wc hope that the night students 
will abide by them.
The police officers that patrol 
the section around the campus are 
very considerate fellows, - but re­
member that they have their- work 
to do also and, that work consists 
of seeing that parking in restricted 
area's is not done: If you find a tag 
on your car it has been placed 
there because you parked beside a 
fire hydrant or a driveway or over 
a yellow curb line. Cars have even 
been parked on the lawn of Schen- 
le Park. It is not known whether 
this has been noticed by the pa­
trolmen or not, but you can bet 
that if some one ;drove a car on 
their lawn, these offenders wrould 
be the first to set up a howl.
Let us be careful to park as wc 
should, with full consideration of 
the other fellow’s rights and prop­
erty. G.

GOOD FOOD 
Open Friday, Saturday and 
Dance Nites Till 2 A. M.
While wine is generally not rc- 
gar/led as quite so potent a drink as 
“panther sweat,” “wild moose milk,” 
and the other varieties of hard stuff, 
considerable interest. is being shown 
in the new .ruling that there is ho 
law against the production and sale 
of unfcrmcntcd grape juicc. The 
ruling was a result of _,a burst of 
Volsteadism which followed an an­
nouncement of the California Grape 
Control. The Control has been con­
sidering the mass production of the 
juicc for quite a while, to relieve 
the tension in the market caused by 
the prospect of a three hundred and 
seventy-five thousand ton surplus 
crop during • lfinctccn hundred and 
thirty.
A good deal of the surplus was 
created by the opening of foreign 
competitive battles that resulted in 
the trade being swung to the vine­
yards of Australia, Grcccc and 
Smyrna. The Control realized that 
the smaller market, coupled with the 
bumper crop would result in large 
losses, and possibly ruin, for many 
of’ the growers, hence, they formulat­
ed the plan of stimulating the manu­
facture and sale of unfcrmcntcd juice.
No attempt is being made by the 
Control to enter into the production 
of the juice, but it is doing every­
thing possible to edge other con­
cerns into the game. The announce­
ment of the Federal Bureau that 
there would not be any authorized 
attempt to stop the execution of the 
plan has already resulted in the con­
sumption'of large quantities of sur­
plus grapes, and at the present rate,, 
it is hoped that danger of a crowdcd 
market will be averted.
•The plan has its advantages for 
the poor working man, and, consider- , 
ing that it is still quite a while 
until the holidays, if the stuff ages 
properly, a good many of the bone- 
dry American citizens will have some 
perfectly legal "grape juice” to 
drink for the purpose of making the 
season “A very merry Christmas, and 
a happy New Year.”

The Night Student Council, upon 
recommendation of President San- 
sonetti, adopted a new method of 
awarding insignia to night students 
at their meeting of October 19. The 
council agreed that this system which 
is known • as "The Point System” 
would prove of greater value than 
any previous method used.
How this system operates is of 
great importance to the student body 
and a short resume of it may be of 
interest. The key to the entire sys­
tem is that each function held on 
the campus has been evaluated by a 
definite number of points. The func­
tions held, by the Council, being of 
greater importance, ' were placed at 
the head of the list aiid were given 
the greater number of points. These 
were followed b}r equal evaluation 
for work done for each of the three 
individual colleges. Articles written 
for “Plaid” (publication were given 
a prominent place, and then followed 
ticket sales for Night Student Coun­
cil Dances and several other minor 
headings. A definite. figure was set 
as to how many points were neccs- j 
sary- to earn an insignia, with pro-, 
vision that tcii percent, of the total 
number of points required for an 
award must be earned by work done 
in the college in which the student 
is enrolled. By doing this, the sys­
tem assures a complete diversification 
of activities and makes it impossible 
for a student to earn an insignia by 
conccntrating his efforts on one par­
ticular branch of work. If the stu­
dent should fall short of the number 
of points required for an award the 
Council decided to carry two-thirds 
of the total, earned points over and 
apply them to any credit earned the 
following year.
That this system places a “yard 
Stick” on the work done by a stu­
dent there is no doubt, but that it is 
a very fair means of making an 
award must he admitted. The pos­
sibility of awarding insignia on a 
friendship basis is entirely eliminated. 
Partiality cannot be shown any one 
as this system will be a true chart 
of the student’s work.
President Sansonetti and the com­
mittee who worked with him are to 
rw congratulated for the thorough­
ness with which they solved a prob­
lem which offered so-many difficul­
ties.- The Night Student Council is 
also deserving in praise for it was 
through their co-opcration that a 
satisfactory solution was reached.
EDUCATION
What Is It?
The first dinner meeting of the 
Citmas Club for the current college 
year will be held Wednesday cvp- 
II-ng. November. 5 at 5:30 p. m. in 
•lie Arts annex (rear of ..Commons 
;A;il Master Masons on the

The individual questioning of ten 
students would likely result in the 
reception of ten different and varied 
definitions. Of all the greatly 
abided words, the word “education” 
is one that receives more abuse 
than is compatible with -'the' signifi­
cance attached to it.
To define the magnificent, almost 
incomparable, and much misinterpret­
ed word “education,” with any de­
gree of accuracy or satisfaction, 
would be, without doubt, a difficult 
task. Even a dictionary, with all it’s 
excellent qualifications for definition, 
cannot-do full justice to -the word.
In a manuscript on evolution, 
Vernon Kellog, the biologist, writes, 
“Evolution is defined in a scorc of 
ways, but not clearly in anyway. 
Each one defines it for himself, and 
no two define it alike.” This identi­
cal statement can be similarly ap­
plied to the word “education.”
Plato, the philosopher, gives as 
the aim of’'education “the develop­
ment of the body and soul to all 
the beauty and perfection of which 
they are capable.”-. When one ac­
complishes this aim,1 after intcrprc- 
:ng it accurately, he can justifiably 
be called educated.
There is a grave tendency to re­
gard a person as educated if lie has 
acquired the fundamental pririciplcs 
of language, mathematics, chemistry 
and musical composition, when in 
reality such knowledge constitutes a 
very miiior part of true education.
To possess knowledge is very com­
mendable, but to possess a soul 
that has been developed to the heights 
of beauty and perfection to which 
it is capable of attaining, is more 
commendable. The word soul is not 
used in the foregoing sentence in a

strictly religious sense, but in a 
sense denoting a mysterious, indefin­
able something that man possess, by 
which he can develop higher and. 
more lofty sentiments by taking the 
proper cultural steps. The soul is a 
potential natural resource of man 
which is capable of the highest culti­
vation.
When a person has developed his 
mind and body to the extent sug­
gested by Plato’s philosophy, lie may 
be called truly educated, for he has 
acquired the art of thinking; vhc 
possesses knowledge sufficient for the 
better TTnderstanding of his own and 
his fcllowman’s problems; he has 
a deep appreciation for the fine arts; 
lie is sincere and considerate; and 
lie possesses a nature that is benevo­
lent, agreeable and capable of .form­
ing unbiased opinions, as well as 
having the requirements necessary 
for performing the oft-times strenu­
ous physical and mental labor at­
tendant to having courage in one’s 
convictions. In short, he is a man j 
who, if all other men were akin 
to him, would be the leader of a 
world undisturbed by petty grievances 
leading to wars, enmity, and similar 
nuisances that distract ^anyone who

casion to congratulate The Tech Owl, 
the official publication of the West- 
inghousc Technical Night School 
Student's’ Association on their de­
cision to publish their school journal 
in tin' form of a newspaper. In 
this form the school news can he 
bettor expressed, but it must be ad­
mitted that considerable more work 
is necessary to the staff to supply 
lews and it also necessitate^ more 
.•()-opcratiou from the student body.
The transition from a semi-monthly 
publication of news in “The Skibo” 
by Carnegie Institute of Technology 
to a page in the weekly college paper 
“The Tartan” by the night students 
was effected three years ago, and 
this news is now published on the 
“IMaid." The venture was successful 
from the start.
The Plaid urges the student body 
of the VVcstinghousc Technical Night 
School to support the staff of "The 
Tech Owl" for they have a tre­
mendous^ task to perform. They have 
served you faithfully in the years

Former Conferences Successful
The first coal conference was 
held at Carnegie in 1926. Under 
the sponsorship of tliei institution 
leaders in the field of scientific in­
vestigation came to Pittsburgh to 
make reports of .their studies. This 
confcrcnce was followed- by a sec­
ond in 1928 which was an even 
greater success than was the first. 
These two meetings attracted world 
wide attention, and established the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
as a leader in this field.
The meetings were organized by 
President Baker and his staff with 
the feeling that research could 
answer many of the problems of 
the coal industry. At these meet­
ings the newest methods in utiliza­
tion of coal were presented, and 
the published proceedings of the 
conference have become a standard 
reference on new developments in 
the industry.
The recently established Coal 
Research Laboratory at Carnegie 
has come as a natural sequel to the 
cqngresses on coal. At both of 
these previous meetings the neces­
sity of a laboratory in America to 
undertake fundamental” research in 
coal was clearl3r demonstrated. With 
the help of the Buhl Foundation of 
Pittsburgh and five large American 
industrial concerns the establish- 
mont of a laboratory became possi­
ble. A total of $425,000 to be dis­
tributed over a five-year period has 
been contributed. Up to the pres­
ent time Dr. Lowry, the director, 
has been busy with the difficult 
task of equipping the laboratory 
and securing a staff of research 
engineers. Four scientists have been 
secured, and according to Dr. 
Lowry, actual work on coal will 
begin next month.
On Thursday, October 23, Pro­
fessor J. W. Trimmer, of the 
Works Management Department, 
spoke to the Automotive Engineers, 
who held a three-day meeting here in 
Pittsburgh last week. The society 
discussed at their convention the 
question of national transportation 
with a view particularly toward 
government regulation of the. mo­
tor bus and interstate automotive 
service. Judging from preliminary 
meetings and discussion of engi­
neers, it was indicated that “Auto- 
tive men are in for a hot time,’ 
and .they must have co-operation 
now in preparation for anticipated 
difficulties. /
The vice president, Frederick C. 
Horner, of New York declared 
that these precautions were ne’ces- 
sary due to automotive transporta­
tion still being in a comparatively 
early state and needing much in 
the way of refinement before it can 
be put in the class with railroads 
and hence be regulated by the In 
ierslatc Commerce Commission.
C. F. Kills of the West Penn 
Electric Company, Pittsburgh, pre­
sided at the meeting," on last 
Thursclay, and J. S. Lowe of the 
Akron Transportation Company 
spoke as well as Professor Trim­
mer.

in numerous instances failure of a 
chain has occurred under ,a load 
or shock much smaller than that 
which the“ chain had carried on 
previous occasions. The investiga­
tion further showed . that surface 
embrittlement has been the most 
serious cause of the failures which 
occur in high grade chains, such 
as those used lor cranes or slings.
With respect to wrought iron 
chains, the results of,the research 
of Professors Thomas and Daniels 
arc very similar to those of the 
investigation done by two English 
men, Gough and Murphy, in 192S.

They shut the door on hybrid styles
Quantity production of equipment has long 
been practiced by the telephone industry. 
Telephone designers years ago shut the door 
on many hybrid styles—seeking first to work 
out instruments which could best transmit the 
voice, then making these few types in great 
quantities.
This standardization made possible concen­
trated study of manufacturing processes, and
steady improvement of them. For example, the 
production of 15,000,000 switchboard lamps a 
year, all of one type, led to the development 
of a highly special machine which does in a 
few minutes what oncc took an hour.
Manufacturing engineers, with their early 
start in applying these ideas, have been able to 
develop methods which in many cases have be­
come industrial models. The opportunity is ¡here!

JOHN ALMS
ROCKNE’S PREDICTION that Pitt should take all her 
remaining opponents except Carnegie is founded on the best of 
experience. Having matched his Irishers against the two rivals 
in successive games, he is able to take an accurate measure 
of each. Then too, the Tartans had a let up in the Western 
Reserve game Saturday, while the Panthers had the hardest of 
opponents in the South Benders. Next Saturday will find Pitt 
jut in Lincoln for ,her annual-tussle with the Nebraska Corn- 
... huskers while Carnegie will buck “Chick” Meehan’s N. Y. U.
. machine at the Stadium. Although both local teams should win, 
time alone will tell which will emerge in the better condition 
:fcifor the city championship game. ,.
*****
PITT’S AERIAL ATTACK AGAINST NOTRE DAME 
proved futile until the fourth quarter, when three attempts were 
successful in netting a total of 56 yards. Of the seven attempts 
made in the first three periods, five were incomplete and two 
intercepted. Notre Dame, on the other hand, attempted' one in 
the last period which was grounded. Pitt’s aerial weakness 
against the Irish does not, however, say that it.won’t be a dan­
gerous means of offense against the Tartans.
* ' ¦ * *• * f v. * •>
JUST BECAUSE N. Y. U.’s BACKFIELD IS MADE UP
OF SOPHOMORES does not say it isn’t a clever and hard- 
* hitting quartette. Coach Meehan said at the beginning of the 
season that this year’s crop of Violets was the brainiest he had 
ever coached, but was lacking in experience. ...To back up their 
V mentor, the New Yorkers took every game until last Saturday, 
when a fumble, recovered on the three-yard line by Fordham, 
turned the tide for.a 7-0 defeat.
CAPTAIN JESS PRICE:of-the cross-country team surely 
knows the highways and byways of Schenley Park. Tie lead 
his team to a 21-34 victory over Westminister Saturday on 
the local course, turning in the: fine time of 21:10 to take the 
day’s honors. The next' Carnegie man to finish was Ramsey, 
•„ sophomore star, who captured fourth place. Coach Halferty 
' wears a big smile nowadays when the future is riientioned, for 
both of these men will be on hand again next season. But 
that’s not all—those Plebe harriers looked mighty good last 
rtf.-. [Friday when they took the Schenley High outfit, 15-40.

COACH HOGAN’S BASKETEERS have been practicing 
daily in the gym. Last Thursday, however, some of the boys, 
lead by““Red” Fergus and “Pee-Wee” Leonard, transferred the 
workout to the Union where the practice featured the music of 
"Jerry” McGeorge and his band. Fergus! pivoting was the 
feature of the afternoon. Leonard and" "Joe’’ Bronson gave a 
clever exhibition of footwork and ’tis said that “Ed” Stentz 
ghowed more speed than in previous workouts.
Coach Hogan Predicts 
», Successful Season For 
Carnegie Basketeers
"\Vc aren’t going; to be easy pick- 
{ ¡rig ¡-for our opponents this year,"1 Said' Coach Ralph Hogan, as lie
¦watchcd the first scrimmage of the
year between two of his. basketball 
squads.
"Boy!' We are going to win some 
hall games this year," echoed Cap­
tain George, Ncasc; as soon as the
Coach had finished'‘talking.
The attitude seems 1o be con- 
tagcous around the basketball, floor 
this year. The team, is not thinking 
about winning one or two games, 
but has its heart set upon winning 
the majority of their contests. And 
to prove their intentions, the players 
have seemingly developed, to a bet­
ter^ standard gf playing than they did 
at any time last year. This state­
ment sounds absurd but it is true. 
Coach Hogan says, “The boys arc
talcing their basketball seriously this
A: year. Already they arc much more
accurate than, they were at any time
last year, and the whole squad is 
handling the ball cleaner than they 
>V did last year. The boys have con­
fidence. Yes, they will win some
games this year.”
Last Tuesday the Coach enjoyed 
the candidates’ first scrimmage .of 
the year. On-the first squad lie had 
about six boys : who alternated at 
various positions,, they were: Captain 
Ncasc, Smith, Fergus, Leonard, 
Webster, Stentz. In fifteen minutes,. 
' the first five had run up an, amazing- 
i ly, large score. Every . one seemed 
¦» won.” Captain-Nease was his usual
J "sure, self." Bob Smith's accuracy,
was almost uncanny,' making seven 
baskets 'out of eight attempts. "Jim- 
"l my” Leonard was not far' behind.
So effectively did the guards work
that their forwards rarely ever got 
so much as a shot at the basket. 
"Red” Fergus played his usual good 
game at guard. “Legs” Webster,- after 
only a mediocre season last year, is 
evidently due for a reversal of form. 
Already his playing has been re­
markably good and is serving notice 
that he will bring a lot of grief to 
his opponents. Stentz and Merton 
arc leading each other a lively chase 
. for the center position., Coach Hogan 
predicts that Captain George Nease 
. will lead the Tri-State district in
P »coring.
The Varsity, however, has .not rob- 
< bed all of the sport light. The 
.jPlojJcs, tmder the guidance of Coach 
Kogan and some of the Varsity 
players arc rapidly gaining mo­
mentum. Friday afternoon .the Coach 
made the first cut of the squad; he 
cut it from over thirty to about 
eighteen. Out of these eighteen the 
Coach has gathered one combina­
tion that seems to work very well 
together. Louis Jagnow, picked last 
year at Chicago in the National 
scholastic tournament as all-tourna­
ment center, has been converted to 
a forward and is going very well. 
Bradly Edelblut has been working at 
center. Several, of the other boys 
who look good are. Rodabaugh, 
Frecdel, Leonard, and Silverman. No 
doubt after a few more weeks of 
> practice other aspirants will begin to
found, into form.
Chick Meehan’s Violets 
Next to Face Strong 
Steffenite Troupe
Next Saturday Pittsburgh grid 
fans.will be treated to1 a game be­
tween two teams, which are gener­
ally regarded as among the flash­
iest in the country, our own Car­
negie, team and that of New. York 
U. "thick”'’ Meehan, master of 
showmanship and coach of the 
Violets, will bring a strong but 
comparatively inexperienced team 
•‘.here for' 'the game which will be 
the fifth annual classic between the 
tWo schools.
As the series; stands now the 
Violets hold a three to one ad­
vantage, in . games one, , Carnegie’s 
lone' victory' having been scored 
last/year. : This will be the second 
time tiie-’ New York boys have 
played, in .Pittsburgh, In 1928 they 
adminsitctVcd the only defeat of the 
season to * strong Tartan eleven 
in the closing game of the cam­
paign. Saturday's game however 
will be the first for the Violets, in 
the new ;Stadium, their previous 
Pittsburgh engagement h av i n g 
marked the passing of Forbes 
Field as 'the home field of the 
Skibos.
The starting eleven of the visit­
ors will present the unusual sight 
of a baclcfield composed of four 
sophomores. One of these boys. 
Jim Tanguay, is at present en­
gaged in; a battle” for the high 
scoring honors of the East in.which 
our own "Dutch” Eyth is also play­
ing an important part. The New 
Yorkers present another All-Amer­
ican bid in .Terry Nemecek, captain 
and left-end of this j-ear’s eleven. 
.Jerry went to‘ N.Y.U.- from that 
well known football academy, Bellc- 
forite, and lias been starring for the 
Violets for three seasons. H'c will 
find tsome other Bellefonte bids for 
fame on the field with him Satur­
day, no less than six of - the Car­
negie squad including Captain 
Dreshar.. having preped a'i; the up­
state school. . .
Both teams have suffered a de­
feat this season, but .the game ii 
expected to have a decided influence 
on the selection of the Eastern 
champions. ..Coaches Waddell and 
Steffen have Bfcen pointing toward 
this game for the past two weeks 
and expect to have the squad at 
the peak for the opening whistle. 
George Ivavel and Alex Ducanis, 
regulars who were injured in tin 
Notre Dame, .contest will in all 
probability be in the starting line­
up as will Eyth, lCarcis, and Mc­
Curdy who were given a rest last 
Saturday at Cleveland. The game 
brings together two equally power­
ful elevens with the Tartans slight 
favorites because of superior ex­
perience.
Cross-CountryTeam Scores Decisive Win 
Over Westminster
Westminister College fell before 
Coach ’ Hatfcrty’s determined varsity 
cross-country team last Saturday 
afternoon- on the Schcnlcy Park 
-course to the decisive tune of 34 to 
21. The Plaid team, determined to 
avenge the defeat the week before 
in the hands of-thc Geneva runners, 
placed seven men in the first ten 
men to cross the. finish'. line. At no 
time during the last few miles did 
the Westminister representatives 
threaten Captain Jesse Price who 
pranccd down Flag-Staff Hill in the 
lead to finish in the 'good tymc of 
29.10 for the full six-mile gruelling 
course. Two Westminister men, 
Smally. and McNally, finished second 
and third respectively. Ramsey, who 
is running his first year on the 
varsity, finished close to McNally’s 
heels for fourth place, while Lord, 
coming down the hill in a beautiful 
stride, garnered fifth place. Ralph 
Frank, wearing the Plaid, finished 
sixth, while a Westminister runner 
came in seventh. Silvers, Page Wor­
ley, and Krebs finished eight, ninth 
and tenth in the tallied positions.
The victory over Westminister is 
a gratifying one for Coach Halfcrty 
and his- team after the surprise de­
feat that Geneva handed the Tech 
harriers. The victory of Geneva did 
not make the outlook for the rest of 
the season look so good, but ’the 
varsity men are more optimistic 
about the rest of the meets.
Saturday' New York University 
will send a delegation to compeTt 
with the .varsity on the ’Schenley 
course. Last year the New Yorkers 
presented a strong team which had 
quite a successful season, and this 
year they are said to have an equal­
ly good team which will extend the 
Scotch vrunners to the limit to win. 
iCoach Halfcrty states that by next 
, Saturday . the varsity runners will be 
in tip-top shape for the contest and 
that a good race may be expectcd 
by the Tech supporters.
The last scheduled meet of the 
season Will be staged the following 
Saturday, November 1, with Pitt. 
The Pitt-Tech meet will be one of 
the-hardest meets of the season, for 
the Pitt aggregation has had a very 
successful season to date:’Both teams 
arc usually on high pitch for this 
annual contcst, and the fact that the 
Schenley Park -course is the home 
route, for both teams, makes the 
meet one of thc-best tests,of the sea­
son.
Coach Halfcrty’s yearlings won 
theiryfirst riieet of the season last 
Friday, afternoon by trouncing the 
Schenley High School Harriers by the 
large score of 40 to 15. The time 
for the winners was exceptionally 
good for- the three mile coursc, 
Wilson and Allan of Tech finishing 
in a dead heat in 16' 20". Only one 
Schenley High man succeeded in plac­
ing in the first nine finishers. Neun 
of the city high school crossed the 
finish line in eighth place* Following 
Wilson and Allan were Mitchell, 
Mattingly, Szymorsky, Pryce-Joncs, 
and Timblc 'wearing the Plebe in­
signia, while Gchr finished ninth.
The Plcbcs- have a well balanced 
aggregation, and' Coach Halfcrty pre­
dicts that several members of the 
team will make, a name for them- 
iselves before . the season is over. 
Wilson and Allah are consistent run­
ners and had little trouble in setting 
a speedy pace. ;
The first class harriers will run ii 
the A. A. U. meet to be staged over 
tlic six mile coursc n,cxt Saturday 
This meet will bring together some 
of best runners of the district,, and 
although the freshmen have been ac- 
customcd to running only three miles 
in their raccs, .they should make a 
good showing in the big annual meet.

HARPSTER OF CARNEGIE
Though the Tartans have another fine team this , year the ¡football 
fans in Pittsburgh still remember that brilliant quarterback, Captain 
Howard T-Iacpster, whose masterful handling of the big Plaid team 
brought victories over Washington and Jefferson, Georgetown and Notre 
Dame on successive Saturdays.
Harpster’s playing was so brilliant that he was almost unanimously 
chosen by the thousands of football fans participating in the national 
football poll of 1928 conducted by Central Press as the outstanding 
All-American quarterback of the year. M<?st of the experts gave 
Harpster the same rating.
Though. Carnegie has another, team of the caliber of that 1928 out­
fit the Tartans \ could not defeat the Irish this year. One reason . is 
that they1 did not hav,c a Howard Harpster in their lineup.
Harpster this season is coaching Geneva college at Beaver Falls, 
Pa. ' It is his first post as head coach and this is his first year. How­
ever, if lie proves as capable a football mentor as lie was a player he is 
going to bring Geneva into the grid limelight.
TARTANS GIVEN
EDGE OVER PITT
Knute’s invinciblc Noted Danies 
of the gridiron continued to iron 
out any differences on the question 
to. who’s who among the best 
pigskinncrs. Their. 35-19' victory 
over Pitt in last Saturday's on­
slaught is one reason for slight 
comfort in the minds of Carnegie 
followers, and ' incidentally a bit 
tough on Pitt. We can rest as­
sured that the Tartan team was de­
feated at South Bend this year by 
an Irish team, of exceptional abili­
ty.
In the first half of the Pitt- 
Notrc Dame'game, the Irish first 
stringers were in full bloom, and 
littered up their half of the score 
with some 35 points. Schwartz, 
on the first play, toted the oval 
in a zig-zag coursc for 65 yards 
through the erstwhile Pitt athletes 
for the initial half dozen points, 
The rest of the first half was typi­
fied by a series of line plays and 
spectacular runs with beautiful in­
terference on the part of the South 
Benders. It is said that Notre 
Dame got all the breaks in the first 
halfr This is true enough, and 
furthermore those geniuses arc the 
ones who made them and took ad­
vantage of the same. This first 
half hour was a close proximity to 
pcrfcct football, as Coath Rockrie 
would have it. I,.
The1 visitors brought with them a 
hard hitting squad of ¿lean tack- 
lqrs who worked on the offense 
with the co-ordination , of a clock.

Tartan-West Va. Yearlings Engage In Scoreless Game
If things don’t get better pretty 
quick, the plcbcs will have gotten 
out o£ the habit of scoring. It’s 
been three full games now sincc the 
Carnegie Yearlings have crosscd their 
opponent’s goal line, but things arc 
bound . to improve sooner or later, 
so let us hope for the best.
At Morgantown last Saturday, a 
powerful Plcbe.v team was held to _a 
scorelcss tic by a light but fast 
Mountaineer outfit. Carnegie had 
numerous opportunities to score, but 
muffed them all either by fumbles or 
by^ penalties. That the Plcbcs were 
the better offensive team may be 
illustrated in that the Plaid , boys 
scored eight first downs to the Moun­
taineer’s four, but it is touchdowns, 
not first . downs, that win football 
;amcs.
Early- in the first period, the Tar­
tans carricd the ball deep into the 
enemy’s tcrritorj', but here Stewart 
fumbled on an end-around play and 
West Virginia recovered on the 29 
yard line. An exchange of punts fol­
lowed with a slight advantage for the 
Plcbcs. At this point Carnegie inter­
cepted a Mountaineer pass on the 
lattcr’s 47 marker,f and advanced to 
the 23 before the Pittsburghers were 
held for downs.
Near the end of the'half, Stone in­
tercepted O'Toole's pass on the Tcch 
45 and returned it to the 41 before 
lie was downed. After three plays 
Stone punted to the Scotch two yard 
stripe where Saylcs was run out of 
bound's. ¦ Stewart punted from behind 
hi\ goal line to the 50 yard marker 
where Harison fumbled, recovering 
it himself on the West Virginia 
twenty-five yard marker. Here the 
home team attempted a forward pas­
sing attack but it was ended by the 
whistle on the Tcch 26 yard line. ,
In the sccond half the Mountain­
eers carried the ball to the Plaid 
four yard line, but here the Carnegie 
line proved too much, and the Plebcs 
took the ball on downs. Just, before 
the final whistle blew, West Virginia 
again had the oval within xhe Tartan 
twenty yard line but could not make 
their advantage count.
Penalties handicapped the Plcbcs at 
times when yardage .counted, the 
engineers losing 160 yards by this 
route. Ovcranxiousncss has pre­
dominated in all of their games this 
season, arid that may be why their 
offensive has had such a hard time 
getting going.
Next week the Scotch youngsters 
play their season’s finale against
iTHtETia
Tennis
The tennis tournament should be 
completed by the end of this week. 
If the tennis courts arc not’ able to 
be used the matches may be played 
in the women’s gym. Eleanor 
Lemon, AV. A. A. tennis manager 
wishes to concludc the tournament 
as soon as possible as1 the gym­
nasium will not be available for use 
after the middle of November.
Hockey
There are just three more sched­
ule hockey practices before the final 
games will be played. On Thurs- 
dajr, team captains will be chosen 
by the women who arc out for this 
sport. The final concluding games 
will be played on Wednesday, Nov­
ember 5, and Thursday, November 
6. An Arts School P and D team 
will play the Freshman team on 
Wednesday while on Thursday the

'ATHLETE’S FOOT
YOU don’t have to be an ath­
lete to get "Athlete’s Foot.” 
Men who do their daily dozen in 
the library giving the old bean a 
big workout; and the boys who 
do a. mental marathon in class 
but never try for the track—as 
well as those who really do give 
their muscles to Alma Mater— 
any arid all are just so much good 
red meat to the tiny germ which 
has spread this ringworm infec­
tion everywhere. Tinea tricho­
phyton is its name and it’s the 
cause of "Athlete’s -Foot.”
in universities from Pennsyl­
vania to California^, it has been 
found that 50% of the men have 
it. The U. S. Health Service has 
reported that <fat least half of 
all adults suffer from it at some 
time.” Co-eds are not immune 
from this trouble, either.
It lurks in the very places 
where we all go for cleanliness 
and health—on the edges of 
swimming pools and sho wers— 
in gymnasiums—-on locker- and
dressing-room floors. In spite of 
modern sanitation (you have to 
boil socks, 15 minutes to kill it) 
this fungus parasite infects and 
re-infects bare feet almost any 
time they come in contact with 
damp floors.
Absorbine Jr. kills the 
germ of
''ATHLETE’S FOOT”
Tests in a famous New York 
*'lab” have revealed that Absor­
bine Jr. penetrates flesh-like 
tissues deeply and that wher­
ever it penetrates, it KILLS the 
ringworm germ. •
It might not be a bad idea to 
examine your feet tonight. At 
the first sign of redness between 
toes, itching, peeling or blisters, 
douse on Absorbine Jr., and 
keep a bottle handy in your 
locker as a preventive. Use it 
after every exposure of bare 
feet on damp floors. At all

Archery
Dorothy Shults, W. A. A. archery 
manager reports' that much prog­
ress has been made in this sport 
during the fall season. The archery 
tournament began Monday and con­
tinues on Thursday from 4:30 ,to 
5.:30 P. M. and on Friday from 
2:30 to 4:30 P. M. The six highest 
scorers will compose the team. 
Fifty ,W. A. points will be award­
ed these women while thirty-eight 
practice points will be given to 
those girls who do not make the 
team but have reported to a suffi­
cient number of sctiedulcd practiccs.
Bowling
This is the sccond week of bowl­
ing in the Murray Hill Alleys. These 
alleys arc much nidrc convenient 
arid enjoyable than the ones used 
in previous seasons. All final score 
sheets should be left at the alleys 
so that Bernice Converse may 
crcdit the games. Only two lines 
of pin, boys may be used daily. 
When the alleys are crowded aixl 
there are not enough pin boys it 
will be ncccssary for the freshmen 
to set up their own pins. There 
remains four weeks of bowling 
practiccs so that ¡any girl who has 
not as yet reported for practice 
and wishes to go out for this sport 
may do so and still be able to 
make her class team.
The Senior Tea for M. M. C. C, 
Freshmen will be held in the M. M. 
C. C. Recreation Hall on Friday, 
October -31, from four until siN 
o’clock. This is an annual party 
which begins the social functions 
given in honor of the M. M. C. C. 
Freshman Class. Tea will be 
served between four-thirty and. five 
o’clock P. M. A short musical

Football Holiday
We hear much talk of the rapidly dying Carnegie traditions, 
and it strikes us that this is indeed a strange comment to make 
about a school which is, comparatively speaking, still in its 
infancy. Twenty-five years is but a brief interlude in the life­
cycle of other slightly more famous institutions that date back 
.. to colonial days. How can,a tradition die in twenty-five years? 
This fouhh part of a century seems to us to be small enough 
time in which to create one.
And the talk we hear is not rumor. Our traditions, if 
such they can be called, are dying in their infancy, some per­
haps in their embryonic stage. Carnegie has no age-old ivies 
of which to boast, no walks that have been trodden by genera­
tions of American aristocracy. She glories in her modernity, 
in her spirit of democracy, in her lack of Gold Coasts, and in 
her serious technically-minded students whom she places on an 
entirely different plane from those who basic for four years in 
an atmosphere of classical nonentities.
Should/there not then be traditions among these moderns? 
Should the few rapidly disintegrating ties, that hold together 
four colleges, already too weakly bound, be allowed to continue 
their disintegration into nothingness?
Concerning what was formerly known as our football holi­
day we hear much agitation. Many students ¦wonder whether 
this, too, is going the way of1 their other children whom they 
had scarcely begun to nourish. This day, set apart from all 
others, on which tribute was paid to the football team, .was 
more than a holiday in the true sense of the word, a day of 
exemption from work.
We feel safe in saying that the exemption from work is 
not the reason for the popular demand for a holiday. On that 
day students are exempt, but they realize that on following 
days they are required to fulfill more than the usual assignments. 
In asking for their holiday, they feel that it is worth the sub­
sequent effort that will be asked of them.
A tradition is, correctly, a custom which posterity receives 
from its ancestors. Are future Carnegie generations to be 
deprived of their birthright? Let this one day of.special festiv­
ity, together with those in the spring, be established for those to 
come, so that the next twenty-five years.will not find that which 
the present generation is struggling to maintain buried in 
obscurity. ^
Think It Over
Your Opinion
It is quite probable that the several changes that have been 
inade in the Tartan this year, changes in make-up, features, and 
editorial material have provoked some comments from our read-, 
ers. Why not let us hear them too? We assure you that they 
will be given our serious consideration and will, whenever possi­
ble be printed in our columns-for others to read.
We are interested in having your opinions. It is difficult 
to continue making changes without knowing how they are 
being received. It is up to you to tell us.
Thursday the annual election of 
honorary cadet officers from among 
tlic Unfair sex will be held by 
Scabbard and Blade. Once more 
the unsuspecting plcbcs will be told 
by their superior officers, "Vote 
for Mary -Blah. She’s the prettiest 
girl ¡ii school.” ' Two’ or three' 
minutes later, the story will bci 
"Vote for Betty Co-Ed, her per­
sonality can’t be beat.” And so 
on, until they close their eyes and 
vote by the well-known system 
of "Eenic Mecnie—,” etc.
But, seriously speaking, the nom 
inecs for the positions, . whose 
names, boys, 'can be found, on page 1, column 6, arc very, very fair, and 
should provide nice pickings for 
some ne plus ultra honorary offi­
cers.
Last Friday night, Kay Kaiser, 
"The Man From the Soytli,” whose 
orchestra is playing at the Nixon, 
devoted a half-hour to the Pitt 
Panthers, who entertained _Notre 
Dame Saturday. Carnegie plays 
New York University Saturday. 
How about it, Kay?
Speaking of orchestras, Guy Lom­
bardo, who also is pretty fair, sent 
a telegram to "Cap” Dreshar before 
the Notre Dame game, wishing 
luck. We’ll just have to get Gu;y 
for the Junior Prom after that.
Carnegie .is to have some new 
songs! Phi Mu Alpha Euphonii 
and “Doc” Baker have inaugurated 
a contest for new school songs, 
open to all students, past students, 
and others who go to Carnegie. It 
it.promised that the new songs wi.l 
be made prominent by the Kilti 
Band, and not by Rudy.Vallee.

Probably the most pressing prob­
lem facing the country as a whole 
at the present time is the disastrous 
downward' swing which the curve 
of the business cycle’has been tak­
ing. The suffering from unemploy­
ment has been so great that the 
government has decided- to take 
action to'relieve the situation. The 
first steps, have already been taken 
in the-nature 'of a thorough study 
of unemployment and its causes, to 
be made by a specially appointed 
committee.
One df the important things. :o 
be considered in this study: will be 
the technological causes of uuer.v 
ploynicnt. Quoting Secretary, of 
Labor Davis,, “By technological un­
employment is meant the displac­
ing of men by new ’machinery, new 
processes, new methods, of produc­
tion and ..transportation and hand­
ling; of .material. There is no use 
for anyone to undertake to mini­
mize the extent to which the dis­
placement of', labor is going on 
from these causes.
“True displacement of labor may 
not mean the protracted unemploy­
ment of labor. It is a question, 
however, as to how far we can 
gain valuable information from a 
study of the past. The great in­
ventions of the past have been 
confined to single industries. To­
day, these ... inventions are . closing 
in upon every side.”
Past records show that every 
improvement in the machines used 
in industry has been a main con­
tributing factor to unemployment. 
And in each case depression oc- 
cured because of the inability to 
adjust to the new situation. The 
employers, rather than the workers 
have always* received most of the 
be'nafit from the labor-saving de­
vices./ How may the invention of 
one of these devices be made to 
benefit the worker? This is a 
point to be considered, not when

the economic’ crisis occurs, but be­
fore the problem' arises.
The employers attitucle, as might 
be expected, is usually a selfish 
one. What he secs in the new 
time-saver is a means wher'eby lie 
may lay off men and\ decrfcasc the 
amount of money, laid out for 
wages. He is sur.c that some new 
invention’'.will come .along ta ab­
sorb the men whom he has dis­
charged. : But perhaps the hoped- 
for invention fails to appear, and 
improvements in, present prbccsses 
daily.. increase unemployment. The 
employer» becomes provoked at the 
constant demands made Upon him 
by. charities, yet' fails to realize 
that he himself is one of the causal 
factors' and .could/ -remedy the sit­
uation..
Instead »of discharging workers, 
the time saved by new inventions 
should be converted into more 
leisure for the . employees. The 
processes required .of each worker 
should be made more simple. -The 
six-hour day and five-day week 
should become realities instead of 
seemingly unachievable dreams. The 
worker slhould have more timfe for 
educational, cultural, and healthful 
pursuits. In this last r.e.spcct in 
particular it can bfc said ' that the 
program'Of- lightened work^has a 
definite beneficial effect on the com-' 
munity.
Theorizing has always been , met 
with the remark that “It sounds 
good, but it won’t’vwork out.’.’ A 
theory should not be condemned 
until it has been tried out, and 
then it is usually found that there 
is something useful in every theory 
—a basic principle which may be 
improved tipon by experionce. It 
«is (not to be expected that by 
shortening hours and simplifying, 
processes wev can • do .away with 
unemployment, but a little fore­
sight and planning on the part of 
the employers will do much to 
remedy the situation.

Tests made by students in the

to a law prohibiting tne entire

state.
MORE CONTRIBS
To the Public Nuisance 
%Thc Carnegie Tartan.
Your article on the Social Service 
menace that was published in the 
Carnegie Tartan about two weeks 
ago is our idea of a cheap way of 
getting publicity!
No one who has any knowledge 
of thfi subject, as you must have- 
to discuss it so glibly as, you did, 
could possibly, write, sincerely, 
the manner that you employed.
It was obviously an attempt to 
create, gossip and comment about 
your column.
Good writing ‘ can be done 
sincerely .but it is in . very ,poor. 
taste to use thgsc methods when 
conducting a column like yours,
We would recommend that—you 
wait for publicity to come to you 
naturally and not force it from 
the pens of your readers as you 
have from mine.

TO THE TARTAN STAFF
Along with those, who find -fault 
with different features or specific 
oversights as • presented , in thii 
newspaper, an.«.opinion oh ..the'*- gen 
cral qualities of the paper should 
be included.
The Tartan, when compared with 
the ordinary, college newspaper; re­
veals, an enviable distinction in re­
gard, to. its well-balanced make-up, 
its sane journalistic qualities- and 
the numerous entertaining feature: 
it presents.' As such it is to be 
congratulated.
IC. A. M.
Speaking vof public nuisances 
there is always the columnist who 
insists on writing at great length 
on subjects of which he has only 
a superficial knowledge. We refer 
to the article on “The Social Serv­
ice Menace” in the last issue of 
The Tartan, an outstanding exam­
ple of such yellow-sheet1 journal­
ism.
. The writer of said article gives 
one the impression that he has re­
cently spent an illuminating- hour 
poring over-the family album con­
taining dagucrrotypcs of ' sweet 
urchins, and another talking things 
over with a disillusioned Pitt in­
terne. Times', have' changed. .No 
longer do we. find; the sw6et debu­
tante taking- up social work in. or­
der to „hear the risque experiences, 
of -the woman of : the streets, but' 
sensible, . far-seei,ng‘ young women 
who realize the possibilities - of 
trained workers in helping them 
out of trouble.
We realize that social work is 
one of the most misunderstood df 
professions. Most people, we arc 
certain, think of social wbrk as a 
number of Lady Bountifuls hand 
ng out baskets of food with sun­
shine in their smiles. The author 
of “The Social Service Menace” 
has somewhere picked up the ad­
ditional idea that. . hospital social 
work completes the picture of the 
entire profession. Does he realize 
that social work includes also rec­
reational leadership . as found in 
-stfttlemonts, community centers, 
playgrounds, Y. M. C. A., Y. W. 
,C. A., the Scout movement; Trav­
elers’ 'Aid; vital social statistics, 
orphan and old peoples’ homes, 
a^jd straight case work in relief ot 
families in distress? These arc- 
just a few of. the divisions of so­
cial work.
When the Public Nuisance con­
demns the whole profession of so­
cial workers, he is guilty of the 
same mistake we would make if 
we condemned all. engineers as bad 
from the standpoint of a criticism 
-of only “commercial” . engineers, 
for instance.
Another point on which we dis­
agree with the Public Nuisance is 
his remark assuming that our 
clothing is scaled on the $20 foun­
tain pen basis when we arc inter­
viewing clients. One of the'first 
things a social work student learns 
is to dress inconspicuously when 
on the job. And, > furthermore, if 
carry $20 fountain pens, . they 
are most likely gifts • from such 
self-asshred persons, as the Public 
Nuisance in one of his weaker 
moments.
With ^reference to the “lost art 
of feminity” bewailed by, this cru­
sading' Public Nuisance, far be it 
from us to claim that we arc un­
suspecting, innocent young thing! 
trusting blindly, implicitly, in the 
saintly integrity^ of those with 
whom we come in contact. Rath­
er, we are attempting to look 
clearly and objectively at life as it 
is fd'iind, with no pretension of be­
ing shocked or. horror-stricken. 
We do not glory in its sordid de­
tails, but we face them frankly. 
And yet the Public Nuisance says 
we arc a hard lot! That may be, 
but we who write this reply stil. 
wear frilled underwear.

THE PUBLIC NUISANCE
OUR GLORIOUS FRATERNITY 
PRESS
"We have fowid a new extreme 
in collegiana—1new apex, if it be 
possible, of undergraduate, ego­
centric, self-aggrandizement. The 
general locale is the average fra­
ternity quarterly. More specifically, 
we refer to that portion of the 
brethren’s magazine which lists the 
achievements of the .chapters.
Compared to the slush of the 
chapter bulletins, the mild out­
bursts of the California Rotary 
Boosters as Schopenhaurish in its 
pessimism. Compared tb the exag­
geration technique of the fratcr 
press, the lurid squeal' of the Daily 
Mirror is as sweetly conservative 
as the Atlantic Monthly. ‘Compar­
ed to—but comparisons are odious, 
and there is really nothing to 
compare it to.
We read, for example, in a 
blaze of blah that. Brother ’Snirk 
is end on the football' ..team at 
Winchester U. And by dint of 
much sophistry (we oncc ran such 
fraternity column ourselves) 
translate it to. mean' that had the 
coach pulled another man off—lie 
would have been Bro Snirk, for
end” and “last man on the squad" 
arc strangely synonymous.
We learn that • Squill'* is on the 
varsity tennis team. And recall 
a faint day early in the fall when 
we were introduced to Bro Squill 
from Gawgia on the courts, and 
out of the , courtesy to the visitor 
permitted him to get one game out 
of six. And our tennis is notori­
ously rank.
We discover that Bro Flickirigcr, 
who was too poor to make the 
show at camp is leading:-man in 
the Masque. And we dimly won: 
der if the typesetter hasn’t''left-'out 
"candidate for” between “is” and 
“leading.”
We view with just pride the 
statement that Eta chapter has 
risen six points in the inlcrfra- 
tcrnity scholastic competition, un­
til we recall an Etan telling us 
that of a freshman class of ten, 
four men busted out.
We evcji discover' that we our­
selves have been elected to the 
editorial, staff of the monthly Blow, 
a publiciition. with AvhlciWwc-haVe 
never had the slightest ' contact, 
save for a letter of scorn which 
promptly went in the managerial 
waste basket.
Our point then is that there is 
an occasional hypertrophy of state­
ment in the average fraternity pub­
lication; that mild brotherly an­
nouncements instead of Ibeijig 
taken with only a grain of salt, 
should be taken with an entire bag- 
full.
Now who really believes these 
communications of fratcr prowess 
Surely not the undergraduate, for
lie is too near to the truth, and 
readily recognizes the similarity 
between his chapter’s little white 
lies and those of all the brother 
chapters.
How then about the innocent 
alumnus, five, ten, even more
years removed from the stark
realism of the fraternity house?
He’s in business now where he ex-, 
pects lies; where overstatement is 
the natural accompaniment of 
every successful sale; where lie 
must be on guard every blessed,
moment. Oh, if he could only be 
back in the good old days at
school — where friendships were
true, and sincerity was the key­
note of brotherly relationship! So 
he swallows the dope, book,' line 
and sinker.
And the result. Well, when 
Moo Chapter wants to build a new 
dining room, and lie gets his let­
ter to contribute, he figures—oh, 
well, no class was ever as good as
old ’16, but still the. boys aren’t
doing so badly. Lookl Snirk’s 
end on the football team, and 
Squill’s, playing tennis, and Flick­
ingcr has the lead in the Masque.
Whereupon lie happily reaches 
for his checkbook .... ,
TARTANS GIVEN EDGE
. (Continuel from Page Five)
The second half opened with the 
Notre Dame second team fighting 
a determined Pitt eleven. Our 
friends from across the creek p- 
over a glaring attack, which wav 
led by Clarke and Baker. Irish 
fumbles and a few long passes pav­
ed the way for the. Panthers’ score 
of 19 points.
The-capacity crowd was held.in 
suspense by the continued drives of 
the Blue -and' Gold. ICnute’s sec* 
ond team was plugging a Way with 
no.*.good results. Barring the first 
half, this situation was assuming 
the attitude of-^a genuine rally. Bui 
the Irish mentor must have been 
a bit peeved at this, and as a re­
sult' sent forth the majority of his 
first team. However, the final 
whistle was close on tligir h.cclsi 
and thus prevented any further 
scoring.
The immense crowd that over­
flowed the' stadium for «.Ilie first 
time in the history serves as an­
other indication of Notre Dame’s 
tremendous drawing power. No 
matter where they are scheduled 
the crowd always turns out to wit­
ness the thrills the. Irish never fail 
to provide.
By comparative scores we find 
Carnegie the slight favorite in the 
coming Pitt fracas.' As far-as foot­
ball goes, any writer is safe in 
saying that this, game will be 
crowded with one full hour of 
thrilling, football.
