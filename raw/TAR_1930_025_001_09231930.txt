The annual Y. M. C. A. banquet 
in honor of the incopiing freshman 
class was held last * night at the 
Carnegie Commons. It was the first 
affair given exclusively for the men 
students, and came as a fitting 
climax to the events of Freshman 
Week.
Prof. H. K. Kirk-Patrick, of the 
English department, introduced the 
Rev. Carl Wallace Petty of the 
First Baptist N church as the speaker 
for the evening. Dr. Petty gave a

as a surprise to have Bill Davis of 
the downtown "Y” lead in the sing­
ing of old and new popular songs. 
Bill is well-liked at Y dinners, and 
he freshman enjoyed the opportunity 
of meeting him.
The Y. W. C. A. banquet given 
for all freshman women was held 
last night at the Carnegie Inn. It 
wa- a rather colprful affair, and tlic

many of the girls to become ac­
quainted with them. The Rev. Al­

church was the speaker for the eve-1 
ning. Among the other guests of |

Tartan Staff Desires
Freshmen Reporters
The Tartan office will be open 
to all freshme t and transfer 
students who are interested in 
newspaper writing on Thursday 
between 11:30 and 1:30. Several 
secretarial assistants arc need­
ed. Anyone who would like to 
apply for the position is also 
asked to corne at this time. • 
Nancy Newman, managing 
editor, and Isabel Levin, news 
editor, of the Tartan will lie 
present to explain some of the 
methods used in the publication 
of the Tartan.
No previous cxpcricncc is 
ncccssary as a course lasting 
four weeks will be conductcd 
for the instruction of the new 
candidates.
Assignments will be given out 
to all Tartan reporters on 
Monday between 11:30 and 
1:30.
An extremely unusual reaction, o 
which there arc only seven of its 
kind in existence, has been dis­
covered by Dr. Warner of the Chem­
istry Department while researching 
at Carnegie during the summer. By 
virtue of this remarkable discovery 
Dr. Warner is now ranked among 
the leading chemical investigators of 
the United States.
A report, written by Dr. Warner, 
has been submitted for publication in 
the Journal of the American Chcmi 
cal Society and will be found in an 
autumn issue.
This nnimolecular reaction—callcd 
the "racimization of dcxtro-liinonemc," 
a terpcnic hydrocarbon—is much like 
radioactive reactions, cxccpt that the 
latter cannot be controlled. It has 
110 immediate practical use but it is 
important in developing the theory 
of rate ot reaction. Thus far only 
eight unimolecular reactions have 
been, discovered.
Dr. Warner attributes his dis­
covery and success of the experiment 
to the exceptionally efficient polari 
meter he used in the laboratory work 
which employs polarized light in de­
tecting ‘the rate of reaation. By 
measuring the amount of rotation of 
the polarized light passed through 
the solution before and after the 
reaction began, the rate of reaction 
was thus determined. Other apparatus 
used in the research was an auto­
matically controlled high temperature 
thermostat constructed in the labor­
atory to regulate the temperature to 
one-tenth of a deg—e between 200 
and 250 degrees centigrade. A 
unimolecular reaction can be com­
pared to compound interest, the 
change being directly proportional to 
the original amount. The half life—

Song Assembly to Be in
Union on September 30
The first sang assembly will be 
held in the Carnegie Union, Septem­
ber 30. Mr. Davis, fccrctary of the 
Y. M. C. A., will lead the singing. 
The assembly is open to all Car­
negie students, and the freshmen arc 
especially urged to attend.
It has been the special desire of 
the Dean of Women and the Dean of 
Men to have the students of Carnegie 
Tech become more familiar with the 
college song3, and they have planned 
this affair with that in mind.
Chapel services and assemblies arc 
held each week throughout the col­
lcgc year and the freshmen arc re­
quired to be present. General As­
semblies arc held in the Carnegie

Drama Department
Plans 1930-31 Season
Plans for the 1930-31 season of( 
the drama department are already 
being formed according to a state­
ment made recently by Professor 
Chester M. Wallace who is head of 
that department.
The first play of the season will 
probably be a drama, which is as 
yet unnamed, dealing with life in 
the Homestead steel mills. It has 
been written by Rev, Barnabas 
Diencs who is a resident of Home­
stead. Mr, Diencs has been an- 
active member of Professor Wal­
lace's dramatic composition class 
for some time and this play was 
rittcn as part of his class work, 
Two other plays that arc being 
considered for production are Syd­
ney Howard’s "Swords" and "Pjl- 
lars of Society" by Hendrik Ibsen.
Professor Wallace was a guest 
director ta the University of Mich 
igan at Ann Arbor for three week 
last summer. He produced, 
well as took part in the “Crimir 
Code" which was presented 
part of the summer school progr

these rooms. The open space will 
be used in the larger experiments.
The establishment of the labora­
tory comes as a natural sequel to 
the work which has been done in 
coal by the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. Under the direction 
of Dr. Baker the Institute has 
organized two international con­
gresses on coal that have attracted 
scientists from over the world to 
Pittsburgh. A third conference will 
held in November, 1931.
Committees Selected 
Two committees will assist Dr, 
Baker in tlitj administration of the 
work. An advisory board, consist­
ing of orpminent men of affairs 
interested in ' coal research has been 
appointed by President Baker to 
assist in deciding the general poli­
cies ofi the laboratory. A technical 
committee, including representatives 
from the research laboratories of 
the companies that have contributed 
toward the support of the project, 
has been named to assist ill select­
ing the, staff and arranging a pro­
gram oi study.Fundamental research in coal and 
its by-products will be undertaken. 
Attempts'’will b'e made lo find new 
uses for coal, and further ways of 
utilizing the numerous products that 
may be derived from it. No at­
tempt will be made to duplicate the 
studies that have been made by in­
dustrial concerns interested in coal, 
and the work outlined will not 
overlap I hat being clone by the 
U. S. Bureau of Mines,Emphasis in I his research will be 
placed on scientific, rather than the 
practical aspect. It has been seen 
that most of the practical improve* nls have resulted from previous 
scientific research. The first prob­
lem lo bo confronted will be that 
of the coking of coal. Some bitum­
inous coals can be coked and others 
cannot, and the reasons for this 
peculiar behavior will be studied.
Graduate Courses 
An important part of the work 
will be the training of expert fuel 
technologists. Graduate courses will 
be given by the research staff to 
a limited number of advanced stu­
dents, with the view of meeting the 
great demand for this type of re­
search engineer.Dr. Baker has long been inter­
ested in the study of coal and the 
use of its products. He was the 
organizer of the First and Second 
International Conferences on Bitum­
inous Coal that attracted famous 
scientists from abroad, and drew 
the attention of the world to Pitts-
William H. Douglas
William I-I. Douglas, Industries '23, 
who, with his wife and small son, 
has been in Cartagcnia and Barronca- 
Bernieja, Colombia, for the past two 
yeays has been visiting recently in 
Topeka,* Kansas. Mr. Douglas was 
employed by an oil company in 
civil engineering work, constructing 
hospitals.
Previous to going to South Amer­
ica he was employed in a similar 
way for eight months in Liberia on 
the "Gold Coast.” His first experi­
ence in foreign lands was in 1923, 
when lie spent two years at Addis 
Abcba in Abyssinia, constructing hos­
pitals. While in that country the 
Douglas family was entertained by 
the King of Abyssinia.
Due to their experiences in foreign 
countries, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas 
have acquired a practical use of 
several languages, and have /many 
interesting incidents to relate. They 
found conditions in Abyssinia very 
primitive, but in South America they 
had every modern convenience. While 
there they enjoyed swimming, ten­
nis, boating, golf and bowling. Tank­
ers came right to their front door 
and were an interesting sight. Part 
of the time they were in a camp 
where there were 50 other Americans.

under the auspices ‘of Dragons, men’s 
senior honor- society.
This is the first of- a series of 
dances held by this society. One

fter a game. The price of admis­
sion is $1.25.
The orchestra is as yet unan­
nounced, but will in all probability 
be one which is popular among Car­

Football players, both varsity and 
freshmen, will be admitted free. All 
freshmen arc cordially invited to at­

held in Pittsburgh at the Carncgii 
Institute of Technology in Novem ber, 1931.
Dr Baker in speaking of the re­
search laboratory for which he has 
worked for several years, said:
"Pittsburgh is the appropriate 
place in •which to study coal. Its 
industrial greatness is based largely 
oil the rich supply of fuel in this 
district. Its future is somewhat en­
dangered by the unsatisfactory coir 
dition of the coal industry. It 
would be too much to say that 
science can cure all the ills of this 
phase of our business life, but re­
search offers the best opportunity 
for solving many of its baffling 
problems. We are in the center of 
the greatest coal field and the 
greatest coal market in the world. 
It is important that the people of 
this district should have near at 
hand the best scientific resources 
that can be secured in the world 
to aid them in dealing with what is 
most vital to the wcllnrc and pro­
gress of our community.1*
Report of Summer
Work Wanted Now
The Bureau of Recommendations 
wishes to compile its summer re­
ports in the near future and for 
this purpose needs the information 
concerning work done by students 
during the summer. All those who 
were employed during the summer 
arc therefore requested to report 
as soon as possible to Miss Merrill, 
so that she may record the amount 
of their earnings and the company 
for which they worked. As these 
statistics arc quite necessary to the 
proper functioning of the bureau, 
prompt co-opcration of the students 
will be appreciated.
"Coal touches almost every phase 
of modern life. As far as we can 
see it will always be the chief 
source of power, and cheap power 
is an essential to human welfare in 
our present civilization. It is the 
source of many of the necessities 
of life.

PROF. TRINKS WILL 
PRESENT “ROLL PASS 
DESIGN” ON OCT. 30
Prof. W. T rinks, head of the 
Mechanical Engineering depart­
ment, is adding the final touches 
to his new book, “Roll Pass De­
sign,” which will appear October 
30. This book is "intended, to 
serve not only experienced men 
with a good knowledge of rolling 
mill operation, but .also;: those to 
whom rolling mill practice is com­
paratively new."
Prof. Trinks began working on 
this book in 1918, with a series of 
articles published in "Rolling Mill 
Journal” and, after much revision 
and expansion, necessitated by re­
search, he will combine these to 
form the text.' Containing 144 
illustrations and designs, many of 
which are full page, and also pro­
fuse details among the 175 pages, 
the book will be a valuable contri­
bution to rolling . mill literature. 
After Octobcr 30, copics may be 
secured in Professor Trinks’ office 
in Machinery hall.
The new offset, or photo lytho- 
graphic process, will be used in 
composing and printing “Roll Pass 
Design,” much of which will be 
done in the shops of the Mechani­
cal Engineering department.
Prof. Trinks lias written 
striking preface for his new book 
"Nobody can become a violin vir­
tuoso or a pianist solely by read­
ing books on how to play the 
violin or piano. . For the same 
reason nobody can become an ex­
pert roll designer solely by read­
ing this or any other book on roll 
pass design. This book taken by 
itself will never make a good roll 
designer' of a stenographer or 
store room clerk. What this book 
is intended to do and can do is 
to help a roll designer to dp his
ing about October 22; dinner 
meeting on November 21 or 22 
and,‘of course, the Christmas par­
ty. Notices of these affairs will 
be sent out later.
Faculty Members Will Be
Received By Dr. Baker
Dr.- Baker will receive the mem­
bers of the faculty at a tea in Ex­
hibition Hall Tuesday, September 23 
at 4:30 o’clock. The president's re­
ception is held every ycr.r and af­
fords an opportunity for the old 
faculty members to bccomc acquaint­
ed with the new ones..
Cwcns, girls’ sophomore honorary, 
have been invited to be present at 
the tea, and will serve the refresh­
ments to the guests.
work better and more intelli 
gently.”
Roll Pass Design” is comprc 
hensive, as will be seen by the 
contents which include tjie classi­
fication and strength of •'rolls, fac­
tors influencing roll pressure, ba­
sic principles governing entrance 
and deformation, and various prin­
ciples underlying the proccss of 
rolling.
The appearance of “Roll Pass 
Design” will mark Prof. Trinks’ 
fifth book. The other books which 
lie has written arc "Shaft Gover­
nors,” 1905; "Governors and the 
Governing of Prime Movers,” 
1918; "Industrial Furnaces,’; Vol. I,

Standing well over the six foot

and that involved directing the 
play of the team, and doing the 
bulk of the passing and the punt'

start, McCurdy blossomed into 
great young player in his last two 
games. He generaled his club to 
its first victory over New York 
University, and was great against 
Southern California, when lie was 
the only Plaid player to last the

"Dutch” Eyth is one of the fast­
est backfield men on the Carnegie 
roster. At Mars High School he 
was considered one of the great­
est young backs produced in many 
seasons. He continued his splen­
did, work as a Carnegie yearling, 
but ran into misfortune as soon 
as lie joined the varsity squad. 
He suffered a shoulder injury in 
1928, but continued to play, con­
cealing his true condition. H 
had not fully recovered during the 
1929 season, but is set for a good 
year in 1930. This is his final year. 
He is studying Industrial Educa­tion.

Claridge, Pa.
End. Weight—ISO pounds.
Height—5 ft. 11 in.
Prep School—Bellcfonte Academy.
Although he did not take up 
football until long after most of 
his teammates, , Rosenzwcig ha? 
been one of Carnegie’s best-known 
players for the last two years be 
cause of his outstanding ability to 
snare forward passes.. He handles 
a football as easily as most people 
do a baseball or a basketball. He 
also carries the ball well- on 
Steffen's pet end-around play, and 
his brilliant play against Notre 
Dame in 1928 earned him mention 
on many All-American selection's. 
Injured ribs kept him idle much of 
the 1929 season, but he reported 
this fall in prime physical Condi­
tion. He is a senior in Industrial 
Education.
Alexander Ducanis,
Binghampton, N. Y.,
Center. Weight—184 potinds.
Height—5 ft. 11 in.
Prcc School—Bellcfonte Academy.
Ducanis became varsity center in 
his sophomore 3'car, and held his 
job against all opposition. He is 
exceptionally accurate passer, 
and an extremely rugged defensive 
player. Not flashy, but always 
steady. He is a junior in Indus­
trial Education.
Joseph Morbito,
Leetonia, Ohio.
Fullback. Weight—175 pounds.
Height—5 ft. 9 in.
Prep School—Leetonia High 
School
In Morbito’s sophomore year, he 
was regarded merely as an under­
study to Karcis, but when the big 
fellow was hurt last year, little 
Joe stepped into the breach and 
played splendidly in all depart­
ments. Short in stature, but stur­
dily built, he has a powerful driv­
ing force, and plays well defens­
ively. So much has he improved, 
that there is * real battle on be­
tween him and Karcis for the reg­
ular fullback job. He closes his 
competition this 3rcar, but has an­
other to put in at his course in 
the Architectural School.
Leonard Schnupp,
Jeannette, Pa.,
Tackle. Weight—214 pounds.
Height—6 ft. 2 in.
Prep School—Bellefonte Academy.
Schnupp is one of the most 
powerful men on Carnegie’s foot­
ball squad. He has a mammoth 
pair of hands that hang almost to 
his knees, and remarkable all- 
around strength. Schnupp is a 
great defensive player. Though 
not always a starting player, Car­
negie plays few games without his 
services at some stage. Len is a 
fine student, popular throughout 
the school, and is a senior in the 
Building Construction course.
James Baushkc,
Benton Harbor, Mich.,
Tacklc. Weight—186 pounds.
Height—6 ft. 1 in.
Prep School—Benton Harbor High 
School
Bauschke was a back in his high 
school days and continued to seek 
ball-carrier’s job when he came 
to Carnegie. However, coming up 
to the varsity, the coaches decided 
that his ‘speed and strength could 
be better used in the line, and he 
now regarded as one of Car­
negie’s first string tackle reserves.

Graveno is one of Carnegie’s 
most promising sophomore backs, 
He helped the 1929 Plcbes to 
win the College Freshmen chanr 
pionship of the tri-state district 
with his broken-field running, his 
punting and his passing. Carnegie 
has usually had a fine running 
back, and Graveno is rated the 
successor to some of .the good 
ones of the past. He is a -sopho­
more in Commercial Engineering.

derstudy McCurdy, in 1930, with 
the probability that lie will break

most actively participated in were 
volleyball, baseball, tennis, Yo Yo 
tournaments, jacks, roller skating, 
relays, rope jumping, baseball and 
basketball throws, and archcry. Be­
fore the* afternoon was half over, 
milk was served to the partici­
pants. This was followed by a 
welcoming to the freshmen from 
the W. A. A. president and the 
introduction of the 1930-31 board 
members. This year’s athletic 
board consists of Ruth Buckwaltcr,

Mellon Hall. Songs were sung 
until 8 o’cdock.
The purpose of such a play day 
is to encouragc athletics among
the freshmen women of Carnegie. 
By supporting Women’s Athcltics 
all Carnegie women derive much 
in the way of better health and 
stronger character. Freshmen wom­
en are especially urged to support 
this organization, as it offers a 
splendid opportunity for them to 
acquirc and to show the Carnegie 
spirit.
Archcry and Hockey 
The W. A. A. board has not 
met as yet this year, so although 
archery and hockey begin at the 
opening of school, no definite 
plans have been made. Dorothy.
Shultz, Archery manager, » and 
Catherine Mong, Hockey manager* 
will post detailed notices at the 
beginning of school. Those who 
wish further information concern­
ing these sports should interview 
the managers.
Tennis
Eleanor Lemon, tennis manager, 
announces that a double tourna­
ment will begin as soon as school 
reopens. Tennis permits must be 
sccurcd from the graduate man­

Coach Iialfrety while anticipating 
a most interesting scdson announces 
that there is plenty of ipporliinily to

team, scorcd high among the world’s 
best shots at the National Rifle 
Matches last week at Camp Perry,' 
Ohio. Ranking twenty-second in the 
President’s match, among over six­

Congratulations
The much needed traffic lights at Forbes and Morewood, 
while a long time in arriving, have finally become a reality. They 
have been talked about and their necessity known for several 
years but not until laàt year, when Student Council passed a 
resolution requesting the administration to take the matter up 
with the city authorities, has anything been .done about them.
When school closed in June the signals were still missing, 
and it was not until the middle pi summer that they were 
finally erected.
The Tartan congratulates the member or members of the 
administration who were responsible for this adequate protection 
to the students.
Freshmen
' The Tartan wishes to take this Opportunity to welcome the 
freshmen and transfer students to Carnegie. We have a good 
school and we hope you will enjoy your four years here, but 
there are several things freshmen should know before they 
progress too far into the first semester.
Plebe regulations will probably be boring and humiliating 
and it will take you awhile to realize that they are necessary 
for the promotion of school ¦ spirit and interest in the activities 
of school life. Accept them with good grace and willingness 
and they will be much easier than if you attempt to buck them.
Activities are an important part of school life at Carnegie 
and the time to enter them is early, in the freshman year. 
Steady work and application is usually awarded by good posi­
tions in the Junior and Senior years. Do not, however, allow 
activities to occupy too much of your time and attention. 
Remember that an education is the primary reason for attend­
ance at college and put your studies ahead of everything else.
For those who arc not athletes there* are. several other 
activities that will prove beneficial and interesting. The campus 
has four major publications which offer excellent opportunities 
for ambitious freshmen. There are also class offices and par­
ticipation in the functions of the Y. M. and Y. W. C. A.
Give Carnegie the benefit of your spirit and intelligence but 
budget your time correctly and don’t attempt too much.
Unique Debut of Tartan Columnist
Is Marked By Estimable Humility
There are many ways of being -a 
public nuisance,
But .1 think the best is to be a 
newspaper columnist. No one is more 
hated, feared, cajoled, generally held 
in disgust, or avoided than these 
highly successful scavengers of ,the 
editorial page. They are the rats of 
journalism, the ghouls who pry apart' 
the even lines of1 type and all too 
frequently disclose the skeletons 
buried between them. Some arc 
clever, some are brilliant, a few arc 
sincere, most arc wealthy.
1 shall be minus two things dear 
lo the heart of the columnist. First; 
1 shall not become wealthy, for the 
Tartan with an adequate an"
ccstry point-blank refuse., to pay me. 
And secondly, I shall miss that 
stimulating shower ot . notoriety, for 
I ’ am lo be as anonymous as the 
doorknob on the door of the edi­
torial offices. One . thing, at least, 
you shall never be able to accuse 
me of doing—and that is of saying 
things to show of; or to acquire 
personal aggrandizement, for I shall 
lie a man of mystery, a voice as 
vague and yet as persistent as those
which whispered in the cars of loan 
of Arc.
This column• will endeavor to say 
something sometimes. Jt will try to 
attack what the writer calls vital 
issues upon this campus, and shine 
if not the correct at least a pene­
trating spotlight upon matters which 
administrations show tendencies to 
hide in darkened corners. It eagerly 
welcomes all criticism upon anything 
•pertinent, especially that directed to 
wards itself, and will readily pub­
lish any comments or letters anony­
mous or otherwise which it .feels 
will be at all interesting to its read­
ers.
In addition, it will Conduct a 
sort of collcgiana concerning the 
quaint doings on other college cam­
puses. It will attempt to combine 
the lucidity and other point of view 
of Heywood Broun with the scandal 
schmutterings of Walter Winchell 
localized to the university world. It 
will attempt many things and will 
fail in most, but if it merely amuses 
you it will be satisfied.
One thing is certain, and that is 
on occasion, it will be

as such. Campaigning -in moderation 
is permissible. The votes are then 
counted by those in charge. These 
elections include class and school 
oltices, and do not pertain to de­
partmental clubs.
Committee Plans Prom
Plebe Regulations committee is in 
charge of the Plebe Prom held in 
the spring, at which the freshmen 
of the four schools appear in costume 
before the remaining student body. 
Popular applause is the basis for 
selecting the five best costumes and 
the winners are automatically released 
from regulations for the remainder 
of the term. At the close of the 
separate assemblies, the entire fresh­
man class convenes to the gym to 
have the best of their number select­
ed. This committee also supervises 
the tcgulation committees of the 
four schools.
The Special committee has as its 
function the supervision of an;- 
problems not coming dircctly under 
the jurisdiction of the other com­
mittees.
ART EXHIBITION
(Continued from Page One)
The Jury of Awards will be made 
up of Henri Matisse of France, 
Glyn Philpot of London, Karl Sterrer 
of Vienna, and the three American 
artists* Bernard Karfiol, Horatio
Walker, and Ross Moffett. They 
will meet in Pittsburgh on Septem­
ber 23 to award the following prizes: 
First prize, $1,500; second prize, 
$1,000; third prize, $500; first honor­
able mention, $300, and a prize of 
$300 offered . by the Garden Club of 
Allegheny Countjr for the best paint­
ing of a garden or flowers. In addi­
tion to these prizes, the Albert C. 
Lehman prize and purchase fund will 
be offered this year for the second 
time. The prize is a cash award of 
$2,000 to the artist of the best paint­
ing in the exhibition available for 
purchase. The ward also carries with 
it ntt guarantee to purchase for Al­
bert C. Lehman, a Pittsburgh indus­
trialist, the painting at its list price 
up to $10,000. The prizes will- be 
announced on Thursday, October 16.
During the time of the exhibition, 
the galleries will be open daily from 
10 a. in. lo 10 p. in. and on Sun 
days from 1 p. m. to 6 p. m. Ad­
mission is always free under the 
terms of Andrew Carnegie’s gift of 
tin Institute to the City of Pitts­
burgh.
Hcllow folks!—
Now that we’ve done our work 
for the year and are back on vaca­
tion, the old campus looks pretty 
good, especially with these fresh­
man girls decorating it in various 
parts. Bill Gcsing, Harry Kolb, 
Moc Talbert, Bill Reed, Harold 
Weitzel, and the rest of the boys 
working in Registration line don’t 
realize what a break they’re getting 
by having first choice of the ncwly- 
llusioned, "sweet and innocent,” 
fres-hwomcn. (Do I hear a voice 
from the Editor saying that they 
may be sweet, but—?).
Sidewalks arc going in by the 
wholesale. Carnegie may yet sec 
the Wellesley custom of roller- 
skating to classes, or the Vassar 
pastime of bicycling, but she will 
never see the Dartmouth pant- 
above-the knee hobby. An engineer 
in shorts is like Goeckler without 
frown.
As usual, the summer survey­
ors and the Tartan staff opened up 
the school. The surveyors had to 
use their transits for surveying only 
this summer."
Your paper got off to a good 
start. Nan Sloan celebrated by driv­
ing right through .Pittsburgh with­
out scratching a fender.
Things I Learned This Summer 
That returning to school can be
really a pleasure..................................
Thai the questionnaires sent out 
by A. Bright and his underlings are
a nuisance ............................................
That summer cottages on Lake 
Erie are no places for ministers or
prohibition agents..............................'
That Walter Winchell and I have at 
least one thing in common,—neither 
of us likes Rudee Vallec. (But we 
don’t hold his membership in S. A.
E. against him) ............................. .
That Eleanor Lemon was an in­
mate of a cottage on. Lake Erie 
for a week this summer ... .
That freshmen always say, “I’m 
going to College this fall” ....
That sophomores always say, ‘Tm 
going back to school soon.” . . .
That juniors always saj', ‘Tm go­
ing back to the grind next week” .
That seniors (ahem) always say 
I’m goipg back to work tomorrow” 
That they all like it, anyway . . . 
Thai! “K” Palcn frequented "Roxy’s 
Fountain, in the toughest part of 
Newburgh, during the summer . . .
That some of the boys with cast 
iron linings can drink gin with 
cherry pop and really enjoy is.
(Not an advt.).............................. .
Thhl the job of carrying trunks 
into Mellon Iiall rooms is my 
greatest ambition . ..... .
That Carnegie has SO (eighty) 
newt, transfer students, p roving 
something or other ... . .
Thai half of the students at Car­
negie take re-exams, judging from 
the number of cars parked during
re-exam period..................................
That you don’t have lo be loquaci­
ous to write a column,—look at
Coolidgel ' . . ................................
Splinters 
Jerry Wise went- in for antiques 
this summer, and is now offering 
the Model "T" to anyone with $25 
(dollars) on hand—Scobell Hall is 
the Beta Sigma Rho chapter house 
until the new one on Bartlett street 
opens—Carnegie has an abundance 
of "little brothers" this fall, with 
newcomers named Flanagan, (yes, 
the third brother now), McNaugh- 
ton, McClincy, Dres1 ar (also a good 
football player), Irwin (better look­
ing that All), Stepaniak, and Rivet, 
besides others we probably missed. 
Jimmy Corrigan, the social flash of 
the junior class, is another "little 
brother” of a Carnegie graduate— 
The plcbcs can waylay Frank Muel­
ler if they don’t like the way they 
are treated, as he’s Chairman of
Plebe Regulations...............He’s at
home to those who want to’rcgister 
protest at the Kappa Delta Rho 
house, and can also be interviewed 
at the “overall store,” where he is 
manager and chief clerk.

Think It Over
"Pittsburgh’s civic decency was . on 
a low plane even before Prohibition, 
that in all fairness must be conceded, 
but ten years of the ‘noble experi­
ment’"have opened new avenues of 
graft and forced a hothouse growth 
of crime and corrUi ‘on, so that to­
day the city can best be described 
as politically putrid. It is very doubt­
ful whether anywhere else in Amer­
ica there exist such debauched, dis­
honest or utterly incompetent public 
officials as those comprising the 
political machine which mismanages 
the affairs and systematically loots 
the treasuries of Pittsburgh and Alle­
gheny County.” Thus writes Walter 
W. Liggett in his article entitled 
“Pittsburgh—Metropolis of Corrup­
tion,” in the August issue of Plain 
Talk. Briefly he describes the blind 
pigs, bawdy houses, gambling dens, 
number racket and slot machines. 
All of these flourish, usually with 
police protection. On the subject of 
prohibition enforcement, or rather the 
lack of it, Mr. Liggett goes into 
great detail. No one in the whole 
political set-up is spared as the ex­
pose describes the successive reigns 
of Frederick C. Baird, Edgar R. Raj' 
and John D. Pennington as dry ad­
ministrators. Each surpassed the pre­
ceding one in the number of raids 
conducted, but their failure to make 
Pittsburgh any dryer proved that the 
sale of liquor cannot be regulated by 
law.
Pittsburgh’s Feudal Structure 
'Pittsburgh—which sometimes. seri­
ously styles itself ‘The City of 
Churches’—presents a situation that 
is positively picturesque,” says Mr. 
Liggett. "Politically as well as in­
dustrially the community is a perfect 
feudalism, with such esteemed' pil­
lars of society as Andrew W. Mel­
lon and Charles M.. Schwab admitted­
ly in control. But while Mr. Mellon 
and. Mr. Schwab devote their un­
doubted abilities to the conduct of 
national and international affairs, 
their local underlings at Pittsburgh 
literally run riot and put on an 
obscene political burlesque show—no 
other term is adequate—which is 
paralleled in but few places and sur­
passed in none.” Graphically Mr. Lig­
gett describes the hypocrisy of the 
public officials who while making a 
show of enforcing the laws were 
constantly breaking them themselves. 
They were commonly present at 
liquor parties and arc known to 
have sponsored and attended special 
performances of shows which never 
would have -passed the Pittsburgh 
censors were they to be presented 
before the public.
Blames Business Men 
Perhaps Mr. Liggett lias been a 
bit severe in placing Pittsburgh at 
the head of /the list of cities in 
which civic indecency flourishes. But

Mellon Hall Sidewalk Exercises Important
Influence Upon Social Life of Co-Eds
Mellon Hall’s sidewalk is about 
to make its debut. And when the 
fledgling’s abutment is completed, 
its present asphalt cow-path will 
have developed quite an urban 
teiiilency.‘ Some argue that thii 
points to the return of the bicycle 
built for two, but we moderns 
know better. We know that 
the youth-sympathizing authorities 
yearned to better existing condi­
tions to the extent of making it 
possible for a couple to walk sidc- 
by-each up the walk in compara­
tive comfort, and with enough 
space to allow for subterfuge. Now 
that femininity/ is definitely estab­
lished, and with skirts what they 
arc, no male—however devoted— 
hankers to trip over the flowing' 
bit of gauze going by that name. 
And no male—however ’umble of 
heart—wishes to bring up the rear 
of any parade when lie could, be 
Big. Chief and Drum-Major com­
bined. And the modern girl,
though discreetly coy, much prer 
fers her swain by her side—for
otherwise she might just as well 
be trailed by a trained robot . . . 
All of which is but saying in our 
old-fashioned way that the wal|< is 
too narrow in the face of traffic
conditions to and from the en­
trance-way. We don’t know its 
dimensions offhand, but we - have 
definite proof that things arc not
what they should be.
Tentative Site For Spring 
Hopscotch 
In its present condition, the—we 
shall call it the grown-up name of 
‘.'sidewalk” as a mark of respect— 
may be viewed only through a 
utilitarian eye as something to
rest . one foot on while stepping 
out with the other, but once wid­
ened there are many potentialities. 
One might, under the balmy urge 
of spring, play hopscotch there. 
And, once remodeled, the walk 
will offer excellent opportunities 
for practical lessons in roadman- 
sliip. A traffic committee might 
even be appointed—to maintain 
constant vigilance after sundown, 
and to 'check up on the number of 
"through traffic;” as compared with 
the local-itcs.
If the goofy spell continues to 
overwhelm the nations strong and 
sensible, we predict a crack jump­
ing contest. It’s been done in a 
quiet way for years by supersti­
tious people, but oncc the roman­
tic allure of a contest made itself 
felt, the drab and foolish habit 
may easily become America’s Lat­
est Outrage. Of course, one-way 
conditions must needs prevail, for 
anyone with the normal number 
of joints can jump cracks down­
hill, while it takes a Paddock-ly 
inclined individual to tackle the 
up-grade with no greater reward 
in view than campus renown!
But only time can tell, and until 
the old gent deigns to disclose 
his secrets we must wait -with 
some degree of patience. Who 
knows, maybe there will be the 
millenium—with no cracks to trip 
over, no yellow traffic light to 
slow up pedestrians, and no mid­
night vigil to urge us on to deco­
rum. In that case we’ll go to the 
movies and sec reel college life, 
with all its roiigh and tumble 
stuff. And until then—practise 
any gymnastics on the Cut.

Carnegie Chapter
Will Edit AL-CRI
The first issue of the Al-Cri 
which is the publication of Alpha 
Chi Alpha, national: journalistic honor 
socicty for women will be published 
next month by Tlicta, the Carnegie 
chapter of this organization. •—
This issue will contain articles 
pertaining particularly to journalistic 
activities at Carnegie. According to 
a new ruling made some time ago 
at the national convention of Alpha 
Chi Alpha each chapter is being 
given the opportunity to edit' one 
issue of the publication. By this 
system the chapters arc able to be­
come acquainted with the work done 
by their sister organizations.

making money the admission ticket 
lo the political ring and drag the 
anchor which keeps the men in. 
Quoting again fron: Mr. Liggett,
“The plain but unpalatable truth is 
that the whole city is now paying 
the penalty for the selfish stupid 
and short-sighted. ‘Pittsburgh plan,’ 
fostered by its industrial overlords. 
Long hours and low. wages mav 
mean large immediate profits to the 
Garys, Schwabs and Mcllons, but such 
a policy inevitably breeds mass 
bullishness and eventuallj' results in 
low civic decency and economic dis­
aster.” Mr. Liggett believes that the 
solution to the whole problem lies 
with the business» leaders. “There is 
a direct and inescapable connection 
between the exploitative and brutally 
repressive policy of Pittsburgh busi­
ness leaders and its amazing political 
corruption. Workers who are kept 
from any expression of industrial 
democracy will not bring any very 
lofty standards of patriotism into 
civic affairs; and in nine cases out 
of ten the same police and magis­
trates who show the greatest zeal in 
beating up strikers and throwing 
tlieir wives and children in the 
street are the greediest. ... The 
overlords of ’ Pittsburgh have never 
wanted well-paid, sclf-rcspecting, in­
dependent workers of the type that 
we should consider typically Ameri­
can. Instead, they deliberately import­
ed foreigners, exploited them ruth­
lessly, and maintained a virtual 
feudalism. The result is a festering 
sore spot' that is a stench in the 
nostrils of the nation.”
REMODELED SKIBO 
GREETS STUDENTS
A fire of unknown origin destroyed 
Skibo Inn last month to the extent 
of about ,$1,500 damage, necessitat­
ing complete reinstallment of fixtures 
and redecorating the interior.
The fire broke out about dusk and 
the interior was enveloped in flames 
before the local fire department suc­
ceeded in extinguishing .the blaze. 
All the damage done by the fire has 
been removed and Skibo opened as 
usual for the inauguration pf the 
School year. New tables, repainted 
furniture and new decorations com­
bine in making this inn as delight­
ful as ever.
Collegiate Contemporaries
Department . store clerks who 
punch time clocks have nothing on 
the engineers at the University of 
Wisconsin, where a time card sys­
tem is being installed. ..Professors, 
having tired of the Complaints of 
students who consider themselves 
overworked, are determined' to ar­
rive at "the truth, the whole truth, 
and nothing but the truth.” The 
probability is that they’ll get it, 
too, because .they aren't asking for 
names. Reports for two weeks 
which have come in show varied 
results. One engineer spent 14 out 
of 33 hours on his thesis. • An­
other less studious-minded man 
spent but 15 hours on seven 
courses, four of which were spent 
on his thesis.* * *
Carnegie students who work on 
publications ana, sometimes consid­
er themselves surrounded by insur­
mountable difficulties, might give a 
thought to .William Adsit Notting­
ham, who is one of three blind 
freshman enrolled at Ball State 
T calchers’ College. He. expects ; to 
follow a journalistic career and has 
already refceived a reporter's posi­
tion on The' Easterner, which is. 
the school student publication.* -1: *
All unusual tradition .at the Uni­
versity of . Arkansas is the Senior 
Walk. It is believed to be the 
only one of its kind, in this coun­
try. Th;e walk originated with the 
class, of 1905, and a new slab’ is 
laid by the senior class' each j'ear.. 
The laying of the walk and the 
engraving of names, this yeafr 192 
in number, is in charge of the 
senior engineers, who also cast 
the bronze class numerals which 
arc inlaid in each slab. According 
to Razorback -tradition, no fresh­
man may tread on the Senior 
Walk before Thanksgiving day. A 
vigilance 'committee, appointed by 
tlie student body,••-punishes fresh­
men who violate the'rule.* * *
Freshmen who wish to bring 
glory to their high school alma 
mater have an opportunity of do­
ing so at the University of .Ak­
ron. An award known as the J. 
P. Loomis cup is presented every 
year to the- preparatory school 
whose graduates have attained, the 
highest scholastic .standing at the 
university during their freshman 
year. The present Loomis cup 
has been- awarded five times and 
is the third cup to be given, any 
school winning it three times be­
coming. lie permanent owner.* '* *
The futility of!;, student ballots 
was remarkably demonstrated at 
Drexcl Institute by the publication 
in the Triangle of a ballot asking 
students whether this, newspaper 
should be published weekly or 
semi-monthly. To quote. "The ac­
tive students of Drexcl have voted, 
the majority being , in favor of a
weekly Triangle. The results 
were: For, 3; against, 1.”' * *
