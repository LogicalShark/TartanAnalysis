Professor accepts Asian post
By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
After living in the United States for 
more than 20 years, the chance to go 
home to his native Hong Kong proved 
too much to resist for Dr. Ed Ko.
Ko, vice provost for education and pro­
fessor of chemical engineering, recently 
announced that he will accept the posi­
tion of vice-president for education and 
chair professor of chemistry at the City
University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
Ko was not just swayed by the offered 
positions, however. “With the change of 
sovereignty, Hong Kong is going to play 
an important role in the development of 
China, so higher education is going to be 
critical in terms of turning out the next 
generation of educated young people,” 
said Ko. “I see that as an opportunity 
and a challenge.”
Even so, Ko said his decision to leave 
Carnegie Mellon was not easy. “It’s al-
Dr. Ed Ko, professor of chemical engineering and vice provost of education, will be 
leaving Carnegie Mellon for the City University of Hong Kong.
ways difficult to leave a place that you 
have spent your entire professional ca­
reer. I don’t leave Carnegie Mellon be­
cause of any negative issues here. I will 
miss the students here very much.” 
“Professor Ko has served Carnegie 
Mellon for 18 years with great distinc­
tion,” said provost Paul Christiano. “He 
led efforts for many years to design and 
implement curricular changes in Chemi­
cal Engineering and in CIT generally.” 
His students have expressed similar 
sentiments. Steve Diamanti, a sopho­
more chemistry major, says Ko is one of 
the best professors he has had during his 
experience at CMU. On a personal level, 
Diamanti said that Ko is “outstanding.” 
“During the first week of classes,” said 
Jason Katcoff, a sophomore Chemical 
Engineering major. “[Ko] took pictures 
of everyone in the class and got their 
names so that when we all came back 
the next week, he would know us better. 
Sure enough, the next Monday, when I 
saw Dr. Ko outside of Doherty Hall, he 
called me over to him by first name. He 
really had made a huge effort to get to 
know just me individually.”
For Ko, the desire to know his stu­
dents has always come naturally. “Teach­
ing is really a personal endeavor,” he 
said. “Ever since I have taught, [I’ve 
tried to get to know my students]. I think 
that the most enjoyable part of being an 
educator is to work with a student one-

CMU adopts new 
MLK Day policy
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
After almost two years of debate, the 
Carnegie Mellon administration has 
decided to cancel afternoon classes in 
observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day beginning in 1999.
In a December 16 announcement, 
University President Jared Cohon no­
tified the University that he had de­
cided to cancel afternoon classes at the 
recommendation of the University Cal­
endar Committee, Student Senate, 
Graduate Student Assembly, and 
Faculty Senate.
“We have historically avoided can­
celling classes on national or other 
holidays during the school year,” 
Cohon said. “This policy was never 
intended as a denial of the importance 
of those many holidays; rather, it is a 
recognition of the personal choices to 
be made by individual members of 
this community.”
Despite the fact that CMU only rec­
ognizes Memorial Day, Independence 
Day, and Labor Day — in addition to 
having Thanksgiving, winter, and 
spring recesses — many people still 
believe that the University should still
cancel the full day of classes on Martin 
Luther King Day.
“We did a mass email survey of un­
dergraduate students on campus,” said 
Student Body President Bryon Krug, 
a senior ECE major, who was chair­
man of Student Senate’s Academic 
Advisory committee at the time of the 
survey. “About 80 percent of students 
responding thought we should not have 
classes on Martin Luther King Day.”
Krug, who has been working on the 
Student Senate’s efforts to get classes 
cancelled for two years, noted that not 
cancelling classes — as all other area 
colleges d9, except for Robert Morris 
College — sends a negative message to 
the Pittsburgh community.
“It’s unfortunate that we don’t have 
a time machine where we could go 
back to when hundreds and hundreds 
of people during the Civil Rights move­
ment were getting arrested for trying 
to get basic rights like voting, trying to 
eat at the same lunch counter — for 
some type of economic equality,” said 
Vincent Eirene, a member of the Pitts­
burgh Demilitarized Zone, a group 
which has continuously protested 
Carnegie Mellon’s stance on Martin

Robotics Institute’s Nomad 
braves Antarctican summer
By JEFF THTBERT
Tartan Staffwriter
This winter break, three CMU 
graduate students in robotics and 
two NASA researchers traveled 
to Patriot Hills, Antarctica to kick 
off a project that could help in 
later explorations of Mars. Trav­
eling with them was Nomad, a 
robot developed at CMU designed 
to search over rough terrain for 
objects underground.
The robot’s ultimate mission 
on what will be a series of expedi­
tions to Antarctica will be to 
explore the environment for me­
teorites (with human supervision) 
in 1999.
The main purpose of this pre­
liminary trip — made by CMU 
students Matthew Deans, Liam
Pederson, and Alex Foessel along 
with Pitt geologist William 
Cassidy and a glaciologist from 
the Chilean Museum of Natural 
History — is to test the on-board 
and off-board mechanisms which 
will be used in the 1999 run.
Most of these mechanisms have 
not been tested in such a unique 
environment as that of the Ant­
arctic — the climate on Earth 
perhaps most similar to that of 
Mars — and how they perform in 
these tests will help scientists 
plan future explorations of the 
Red Planet.
On-board systems to be tested 
primarily include cameras and 
sensors, which will be used both 
in Nomad’s general navigation 
and in the search itself. One of 
Nomad’s more interesting com­
ponents is its unique panospheric 
camera which allows for full 360- 
degree visualization. This visu­
alization is helpful, in that it en­
ables researchers to view what is 
taking place at any location 
around Nomad using only one 
camera, allowing for easier navi­
gation. A radar sensor will also 
be tested at Patriot Hills that 
should allow Nomad to map 
the Antarctic ice fields it encoun­
ters, giving it the ability to 
foresee potentially dangerous 
areas and to detect objects buried 
under the ice.
Researchers will also be exam­
ining the Global Positioning Sys­
tem (GPS), a system developed 
by the Department of Defense in 
1995 which uses a network of 24

The Intelligent Workplace, on the top floor of Margaret Morrison, was designed to have an open-air feel.

CMU faculty and staff re­
searchers began changing the 
way we work on 
December 9 when 
the University of- 
ficially opened 
the Robert L.
Preger Intelli­
gent Workplace 
(IW), a 7,000 
square foot labo­
ratory geared to­
ward improving ^¦ 
productivity in 
the workforce.
The $4 million facility, found 
on the roof of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall, fea­
tures state-of-the-art auto­
mated systems for lighting, 
heating, and ventilation and is 
designed to create a pleasing 
office environment by provid­
ing an open-air feel and com­
fortable furniture.
“It’s absolutely gorgeous.... You 
really feel fresh all the day 
through because you’re in con­
tact with the outside environ­
ment,” said Paul Matthew, one 
of eight research staffers and 
faculty members from the Archi-
occupants of the IW have ulti­
mate control over their immedi­
ate environment, said Volker 
Hartkopf, director of the CBPD. 
Workers are able to change the 
temperature, adjust lighting 
to their comfort level, and 
--------- regulate sunlight com­
ing through skylights 
and windows.
The workspace furni­
ture and walls have 
“modular components” 
so office rooms can 
change in size depend­
ing on the needs of 
the organization.

Tobacco industry settles 
suit with state of Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas an­
nounced Friday it will get $15.32 billion 
over 25 years from the tobacco industry 
to settle its lawsuit over smoking-related 
health care costs, with most of this year’s 
money set aside to benefit children.
The largest settlement in the his­
tory of U.S. litigation, the settlement 
tops the combined amount Big To­
bacco has paid to settle two other state 
cases. Florida and Mississippi received 
a total of $14.4 billion last year.
“Our lawsuit asserts that the history 
of this industry has been rooted in a 
concerted, decades-long conspiracy to 
conceal the truth about tobacco,” Texas 
Attorney General Dan Morales said.
“As a direct result, millions of Ameri­
cans — fathers, sons, daughters, moth­
ers — have died horrible, preventable, 
premature deaths. This must stop,” he 
said. “Nothing less than the promise 
and the potential of America hangs in 
the balance.”
Texas will receive $725 million up 
front and more than $1.2 billion this 
year. The 1998 money will go toward a 
variety of health care services for all 
Texans, children’s health care, anti­
smoking education and enforcement.
The deal pays Texas more than $1 
billion more than the state would
have received as part of a proposed 
national settlement negotiated with 
a coalition of states last June. By 
breaking out on its own, Texas is 
guaranteed to be paid; there are no 
guarantees with the national deal 
because it is pending in Washington.
Aside from the money, the settle­
ment also requires the tobacco indus­
try to remove all billboards in Texas — 
including those in sports stadiums — 
within four months. Advertising also 
must be removed from buses, taxis, 
airports and trains.
One issue apparently still to be re­
solved is how to pay the five private 
lawyers who worked with the state. 
On Friday, the state filed four motions 
asking U.S. District Judge David 
Folsom to arbitrate the attorney fees. 
They would’ve received 15 percent of a 
jury award; if they get the same chunk 
, of this deal, that would be nearly $2.3 
billion, or $460 million each.
Such a move could have dramatic 
impact on the 37 other state lawsuits 
pending against Big Tobacco. A trial is 
to start Tuesday in Minnesota, where 
the state and Blue Cross Blue Shield 
of Minnesota are seeking unspecified 
punitive damages on top of actual dam­
ages estimated at $1.75 billion.

Networks up ante 
for NFL football
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - For the 
television networks that went deep for 
the rights to broadcast games of the U.S. 
National Football League, the prospect 
of losing viewers proved far scarier than 
the prospect of losing money. .
The NFL this week struck an aston­
ishing $17 billion deal with the U.S. 
television networks Fox, CBS, ABC and 
ESPN to carry American football for the 
next eight years.
NBC, left on the outside after being 
outbid by CBS for American Football 
Conference rights, stemmed the bleed­
ing Wednesday by negotiating the re­
turn of its top-rated hospital drama, 
“ER,” for* three more years — at $13 
million per episode.
CBS knew all too well the consequences 
of losing out on football. When Fox took 
away the National Football Conference 
rights from CBS four years ago, the 
network lost affiliates to Fox and saw its 
ratings slump.
And although football ratings have 
declined, they are slipping at a rate 
much slower than prime-time network 
programming.
CBS and ABC expect to immediately 
jack up the prices for advertising on 
football telecasts. Even so, the price for 
broadcastingfootball rose so steeply that 
there’s some question about whether 
the networks can possibly make money.
“It certainly sounds to all of us like it 
would be very difficult for them to make 
a profit on it,” said Robert Gutkowski, 
former head of the MSG local sports 
network in New York.
Unabomber trial 
faces new delay
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - In yet 
another delay in the Unabomber trial, a 
federal prison psychiatrist has been given 
an’ extra day to decide whether Theodore 
Kaczynski is competent to stand trial.
Dr. Sally Johnson spent 19 hours talk­
ing to Kaczynski this week and was 
expected to submit her report to the 
judge and attorneys late Friday.
But U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell 
Jr. gave her until Saturday to make her
recommendation, which will remain 
sealed to the public. Johnson had not 
filed her report as of 10:30 am, and it was 
not known precisely when she would.
Burrell ordered the examination 
January 8 after Kaczynski demanded 
to drop his attorneys and take over 
his defense, then tried to hang him­
self in jail.
Kaczynski, 55, has strongly opposed 
his lawyers’ plan to portray him as 
mentally ill. He is being tried for four 
attacks on four men.
After reviewing Johnson’s report over 
the holiday weekend, the judge and at­
torneys will decide Tuesday whether to 
have a full competency hearing. That 
hearing will take place Thursday at 8 
am, with the trial to begin two hours 
later if Kaczynski is found competent.
If he's ruled incompetent, the process 
comes to an abrupt halt, said Rory Little, 
a Hastings Law School professor and 
former federal prosecutor.
Even if Kaczynski is ruled compe­
tent, demands made by the defense — 
retaining some appeal rights and con­
trol over where Kaczynski would serve 
his sentence — could well undermine 
an agreement.Police utilize tear 
gas at KKK rally
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - A Ku Klux 
Klan (KKK) rally Saturday set off 
a scuffle between rock-throwing anti- 
Klan protesters and police, who fired 
tear gas into the crowd and arrested 
about 20 people.
No serious injuries were reported but 
ambulances picked up several people 
overcome by tear gas. Police hustled away 
the 50 Klansmen, who were unharmed.
Witnesses said the trouble began when 
a young white man wearing a Confeder- 
ate-flag T-shirt walked into a mostly 
black crowd of 500 to 600 protesters 
packed behind police lines.
Pushing and shoving ensued and po­
lice moved in to break it up. The tear gas 
soon followed.
“There was this big fight in the middle 
of the crowd (that police) were trying 
to stop,” said witness Chris Hadley. He 
said many in the crowd were unaware 
of the fight and thought the police 
action was unprovoked. Police fired nu: 
merous volleys of tear gas over a
45-minute span and used a large spray 
gun spewing pepper gas.
Hadley said the crowd turned and ran 
en masse once tear gas started popping. 
“There was just this wall of people run­
ning at me,” he said.
The protesters broke up and reformed 
several times into smaller groups, occa­
sionally throwing tear gas canisters back 
at police and hurling rocks and bottles.
The Klan rally, organized by a KKK 
group from Indiana, was confined to the 
front steps at one end of the Shelby 
County Courthouse.
The anti-Klan protesters were 
kept at the opposite end of the court­
house, separated from the robed and 
hooded Klansmen by police and 
sheriffs deputies.
The Klansmen, led by Jeff Berry, Impe­
rial Wizard of the KKK, rallied against 
interracial marriage, homosexuality, and 
the national holiday Monday honoring 
Martin Luther King Jr.Iraq threatens to 
end cooperation
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Adding a 
threat to the standoff in Iraq, President 
Saddam Hussein vowed Saturday to sus­
pend cooperation with U.N. weapons in­
spectors if the United Nations doesn’t end 
the searches within the next four months.
The chief U.N. inspector, en route to 
Baghdad to persuade Iraq to grant in­
spectors entry to all sites, responded 
with a warning of his own.
“We must have the access we require. 
Otherwise, there is going to be nothing 
but further sanctions,” Richard Butler 
said during a stop in the Persian Gulf 
nation of Bahrain.
The U.N. Security Council ordered 
Iraq to dismantle its nuclear, chemical 
and biological weapons programs as i 
condition for ending the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War. U.N. officials have reported 
progress in the nuclear and chemical 
areas, but suspect Iraq is holding back 
information on biological weapons!
In November, Iraq’s National Assem­
bly recommended suspending ties if the 
inspectors don’t finish their disarma­
ment activities before May 20.
In a televised speech, Saddam 
said that if the inspections are not 
over by that time, he will follow the 
lawmakers’ recommendation.Old Man Winter refuses to give up hold on Northeast as cold persists
AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - 
Clouds gave way to sunshine Sat­
urday as utility crews labored in 
frigid cold to restore service to 
thousands of people in their tenth 
day without electricity.
Maine’s two largest electricity 
providers said Saturday that a 
few areas blacked out by a major 
ice storm were fully back on line 
or close to it, although some sum­
mer homes might not see elec­
tricity until spring.
“It’s quiet for the first time in 
days. We’re all enjoying that,” 
said National Guard Master 
Sgt. Allyson Cox at the state’s 
Emergency Management Agency 
headquarters.
However, the National Weather 
Service warned of dangerously
low wind chills in southern and 
central Maine. Northerly wind 
gusting to 30 mph combined 
with temperatures in the teens 
to produce wind chills down to 
20 below zero.
“But cold isn’t that big a deal, 
because crews are pretty 
well-equipped, clothing-wise,” 
Cox said.
Maine’s biggest utilities said 
Saturday that they still had more 
than 48,000 home and business 
customers without power, down 
from a peak of nearly 400,000 a 
week ago.
In northern New York state, 
where six counties had been de­
clared a federal disaster area, 
about 61,000 customers were still 
waiting for power.
Crews in New York were ham­
pered by a storm that piled as 
much as 18 inches of snow in their 
way on Thursday and Friday.
“The snow means we have to 
have roads plowed across fields 
so that our crews and trucks can 
gain access to lines and install 
new poles,” said Robert Perkins 
of New York State Electric & Gas.
Central Maine Power Co. said 
it had fully restored service to all 
but a few year-round residents in 
some areas.
“However, there are hundreds 
of unoccupied seasonal residences 
which will still need repair and 
that effort could easily stretch 
into the spring, given the remote 
locations involved,” said CMP 
spokesman Mark Ishkanian.
A new ice storm Friday coated 
much of Connecticut, which had 
escaped the brunt of the earlier 
storm that hammered northern 
New England and New York.
About 16,200 Connecticut 
homes remained blacked out 
Saturday, but most were expected 
to have service restored 
during the weekend, utility 
officials said.
Ice collected in a thick coat on 
everything from power lines to 
airliners and parked cars.
“My car was covered with a 
sheet of ice, like a quarter-inch 
thick,” said David Greene, a cou­
rier in Connecticuit who suffered 
bloody knuckles from chipping 
the ice off the windshield and 
hood of his car.

50 YEARS AGO, January 27, 
1948 — The Student Council’s 
meeting came to an uproar when 
the food servings at Skibo were 
described as being “GI Style.” The 
representatives’ plans for the caf­
eteria contained suggestions like. 
serving food directly on dishes or 
trays in order to initiate “certain 
economies.” Many other issues 
were brought up at the meeting, 
including a revision to the method 
of voting in Student Council elec­
tions, a motion to obligate The 
Tartan to print Council minutes, 
and a request that the Council 
resume the budgetary control 
which it had held previous to 
World War II.
25 YEARS AGO, December 12,
1972 — The Allegheny County 
Health Department reduced Car­
negie Mellon University’s status 
as a non-polluter to that of non-
complier. That meant CMU was 
guilty of producing twice the 
amount of pollutants by law. The 
source of heat at the time was 
coal. For it to be possible for CMU 
to again be in compliance with 
the law, the school would have to 
convert to oil. However, the con­
version would have to wait until 
the summer, when only one of the 
three boilers were lit. The Univer­
sity estimated the cost of convert­
ing the boilers to oil firing at ap­
proximately $500,000.
TEN YEARS AGO, January 
19, 1988 — The raid on several 
fraternities in November of 1987 
triggered several major changes 
in how fraternity parties were to 
be run in the future. The fraterni­
ties were asked to make their 
parties less overt and were no 
longer able to post advertise­
ments for their parties. The alco­
hol policy was changed, as well. 
The new rule prohibited drink­
ing outside of the fraternity, in­
cluding on the porches. If indi­
viduals were caught outside with 
alcohol, they would be fined.
FIVE YEARS AGO, January
18,1993 — A student was found 
dead in his Morewood Gardens 
dormitory on January 6. The 
police report described the man­
ner of death as apparent sui­
cide. The student, Ian Gardner, 
was also a part-time paramedic. 
Suspicions were first aroused 
when he didn’t show up for work 
and didn’t return any calls. 
Later in the week, his mother 
called Campus Police saying 
that she hadn’t heard from her 
son in over a week. She gave the 
police authorization to enter the 
room, and that is when they 
found the body.
ONE YEAR AGO, January 
27, 1997 — CMU students went 
to Washington D.C. on a Stu­
dent Life Office sponsored trip 
to see President Clinton’s inau­
guration. Thé visit also provided 
the 48 students with a chance for 
students to tour various histori­
cal sights. Another highlight of 
the trip was the American Gala, 
a dress rehersal for the Inaugu­
ration Gala held the next night. 
They saw many celebrities such 
as Candice Bergen, Jimmy 
Smits, Stevie Wonder, and Dave 
Matthews Band. Some of the stu­
dents who were willing to miss 
more classes and pay higher 
prices for the tickets went to one 
of the Inaugural Balls held on 
the Monday following Clinton’s 
inauguration.

“By having an interruption in

likelihood that people are going 
to stop and really think about 
what Martin Luther King really 
stood for — about the values that 
he represented, such as diver­
sity, equality, civil rights, peace­
ful protest — the ideals that Mar­
tin Luther King’s life was lived 
for,” said Krug.
Despite this broad student sup­
port, however, the administra­
tion was cautious in embracing a 
full cancellation of classes. In­
deed, the Faculty Senate passed 
a resolution at its January 14 
meeting which encourages the 
University community to further 
reflect on the issue. The resolu­
tion also suggested that students 
and staff consider the possibilty 
of honoring King on his
to 150 students actually attended 
University-sponsored Martin 
Luther King Day events in 1997.
“There’s a possiblity that some 
students will not take the day 
seriously — that some students 
might sleep in and might not 
really think about what Martin 
Luther King stood for,” said 
Krug. “I’d like to believe that 
those students are in the minor­
ity, that most of us do think about 
these things.”
The Student Senate first raised 
the issue of recognition for Dr. 
King’s birthday in the spring of 
1996, when the Academic Affairs 
committee decided to examine 
the school’s policy. That resolu­
tion had little effect on policy, 
and last fall the Student Senate 
passed another resolution with

satellites positioned in particu­
lar orbits around the Earth, in 
order to allow properly-equipped 
users to determine their location 
at any point on the planet. This 
system has never undergone ex­
tensive testing in Antarctica, and 
because satellites cannot orbit the 
south pole, the accuracy of GPS 
there is questionable. If it does 
work, it would be quite helpful to 
the Nomad project, as the robot 
could then be located at any time
during its search.
However, not all the experi­
ments are being performed with 
Nomad’s 1999 trip in mind. The 
current plan calls for Nomad to 
visit Antarctica again in the year 
2000, where it will work with a 
solar-powered robot that has yet 
to be developed in order to per­
form autonomous searches for 
meteorites not requiring direct 
human supervision. The re­
searchers will be testing the so­
lar cells that they intend to use to
power the project. The primary 
question is how much sunlight 
the cells will actually be able to 
collect, and hence how much the 
power the robot will have with 
which to function.
Nomad, already went through a 
testing run this past summer 
when it made a 133-mile trek 
across the Atacama Desert. Dur­
ing this mission, it displayed ca­
pabilities that included autono­
mous obstacle avoidance and ef­

course without knowing who 
they are.”
To fill the role, the CUHK 
used a search committee simi­
lar to the one that Carnegie 
Mellon used when replacing 
former President Robert 
Mehrabian. Ko said lie was 
interviewed in October and 
that later they made him an 
offer. He decided to accept the 
offer last November.
“In my new role, even though 
I do carry an academic appoint­
ment, I’m expected to be a full­
time administrator. Inciden­
tally, City University has 17,000 
full-time students, so it’s a very 
large institution. It’s going to 
demand a lot of my attention as 
an administrator.”
And despite recent economic 
turmoil in Eastern Asia, includ­
ing that in the Chinese province of 
Hong Kong, Ko said that he re­
mains optimstic and he wouldn’t 
be going there if he wasn’t.
“[Ko’s] organizational skills, 
combined with his experience 
as a teacher and passion for im­
proving the educational experi­
ence of our students, have 
yielded remarkable results,” 
said Christiano. “We shall miss 
his insight and leadership.” 
“Dr. Ko was more than a pro­
fessor,” said Katcoff. “He was a 
friend, as well — and he never 
tried to be ohe and not the other. 
[He] has made a great impact on 
my life for the better, and I’m 
sorry to see him go.”

NESS, 12:10 am and 12:00 am — 
Twice over winter break, fumes 
from Rentokil gas, a chemical 
used as a pesticide, made custo­
dians sick.
The first incident occurred in 
the University food service area. 
The workers experienced nausea, 
headaches, scratchy throats, 
and burning sensations on their 
skin. The decision was then made 
to close the UC for the remainder 
of the night while the fumes 
dissipated.
The second incident occurred 
in Highlander Cafe. The workers 
had been in the café for an hour 
before they began to experience 
symptoms. The woman who called 
in the complaint was affected the 
worst. When the police arrived, 
she was sitting in a chair cough­
ing and vomiting.
The police then went into the 
cafe, where they smelled an unfa­
miliar odor and experienced tin­
gling in their throats after being 
in the area for only 10 minutes. 
The woman was transported to 
Shadyside Hospital.
12/24 SUSPICIOUS PER­
SON, 2:25 am — A Central Prop­
erty Services supervisor called 
Campus Police to report a suspi­
cious person in Wean Hall.
On the third floor near the el­
evators, the officers found the 
man wearing a tan trench coat, 
sitting on a bench, taking off his 
shoes. The actor was identified 
via an expired passport.
The man said that he often vis­
its Hunt Library and also uses 
the vending machines on the sec­
ond floor of Wean Hall. He was 
warned that Carnegie Mellon is 
private property and that if he 
returned he would be subject to 
arrest for defiant trespass. The 
man stated several times that he 
thought CMU was public prop­
erty because of the federal dona­
tions and monies allocated to it. 
Since he claimed to pay federal 
taxes, he believed it should be 
open to the rest of the general 
public. The man was again 
warned and escorted off of Uni­
versity property.

Carnegie Mellon University19 January 1998
Half-day holiday fails to honor MLK
In order to solve CMU’s struggle 
to appropriately celebrate the 
birthday of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., President Cohon has 
decided to cancel afternoon classes 
onMLKDayeffective 1999. Those 
administrators in favor of the half­
day decision most likely fear that 
if they cancel school for an entire 
day, students will fail to use the 
free time to celebrate King’s ide­
als and instead use the break to 
get off campus rather than attend 
MLK Day events. But the deci­
sion to have a half-day off is clearly 
a compromise and a half-hearted 
effort. Ahalf day sends out a mixed 
message to the campus commu­
nity and inadequately provides 
students with an opportunity to 
celebrate King and his ideals.
A half day might meet the in­
tention of giving some students 
more free time to attend on-cam- 
pus activities, but it sends out the 
message that CMU’s observation 
of MLK Day is just a formality 
intended to impress the public 
instead of serve the needs of the 
campus community.
While groups such as Student 
Activities and the Student Life 
Office offer varied programs on 
MLK Day, many students might 
choose to honor the day in other 
ways — for example, by attend­
ing off-campus events that re­
quire more than a few hours. 
Although there will be students 
who opt not to observe MLK Day,
the University must acknowledge 
that this is subordinate to the 
interests of campus members 
wishing to recognize the day. 
They deserve ample opportunity 
to choose how to remember King’s 
work — to consider what mean­
ing King’s actions carried. This 
varies with each individual as 
does the manner in which they 
choose to remember.
Although classes will be can­
celled after 12:30 pm, MLK Day 
will not be a staff holiday. All 
staff members will be compen­
sated if they choose to take the 
afternoon off, but the formal sig­
nificance of MLK Day is reduced 
to that of a staff picnic. Cohon 
stated that he expects the cam­
pus to use the afternoon to cel­
ebrate together rather than just 
take time off from work. But for 
many, setting aside their work 
is a sign of respect for the 
memory of an important Ameri­
can figure.
Half a day of rememberance is 
a good start. But on a campus 
such as CMU, it is vital to send 
out the message that work should 
not take precedence over every 
other aspect of our lives. The fail­
ure to embrace MLK Day with a 
full day off contradicts this. It 
also dampens the spirit with 
which anyone can celebrate the 
entirety of Dr. King’s birthday, 
since we are being told to ignore it 
for the first half of the day.
Students need real-world training
An interdisciplinary mode of 
education gives students the op­
portunity to learn material out­
side of their primary concentra­
tion and the chance to work with 
people who have different prob­
lem-solving mindsets. While the 
effort to increase the number of 
interdisciplinary classes and 
projects at CMU has been sub­
stantial in recent years, more 
effort must be given to this 
worthwhile area of education. 
Taking part in this kind of hybrid 
environment, especially at CMU, 
would better prepare stud­
ents for the interdisciplinary 
working world.
By offering more cross-depart- 
mental classes and ensuring that 
these classes are respected in the 
University community, CMU will 
live up to its status as an innova­
tive university able to combine 
intense concentration on indi­
vidual majors while maintaing 
room for exploration. An institu­
tion that doesn’t offer the oppor­
tunity for a multi-faceted educa­
tion may produce students whose 
knowledge is so focused they are 
only qualified to perform a nar­
row beam of tasks and work with 
few types of people.
Of the several interdisciplinary 
classes and projects offered now, 
very few combine truly distinct 
sectors of academia. The major in 
Human Computer Interaction 
(HCI) brings together computer 
science, psychology, and design 
students, provingthatwhatsome

James Mojonnier/Tartan Art Co-EditorGOP idiots shouldn't call names
Lorelei Laird
Children quickly learn that the adults 
around them don’t have much patience 
for name-calling. Mommy and Daddy 
were a lot less impressed when we yelled 
that Jimmy was a stupid-head than when 
we told them why. Not long after, we 
(mostly) learned that using a person’s 
group identification as an insult was a 
no-no in public life as well — indeed, 
anyone using the words “nigger,” “wet­
back,” or “fag” in public is likely to draw 
more disdainful looks than respect for his 
or her opinion. Yet this s ame rather child­
ish and ignorant custom of name-calling 
seems to be not only the accepted practice 
of the more vocal rank-and-file conserva­
tives of this nation, but also the 
campaigning strategy of some of our 
nation’s leaders.
Don’t get me wrong. I don’t consider 
' myself a Democrat any more than I do a 
Republican. Sometimes I can barely tell 
the difference. One does not have to be a 
liberal to be put off when supposedly 
thinking adults treat politics as an ex­
cuse to spew irrational hatred and call it 
debate. Nor am I under any illusions that 
conservatives are alone in this affliction;
given the chance, Democrats can be just 
as hateful to Republicans, and if either 
one thinks there’s a chance of a third 
party coming into power, they team up 
and turn on that party like starving 
mutts. But the conservative name-call- 
ers far outweigh the liberal ones in mag­
nitude and viciousness, and despite all 
the talk of the biased ‘liberal media,” it is 
always they who seem to write the edito­
rial columns and letters to the editor full 
of scathing diatribes. And as far as I can 
remember, I’ve never heard a liberal 
politicianrefer scornfully to an opponent’s 
idea as “conservative idiocy” or any such 
thing. The most disturbing thing about 
the trend of name-calling is not that it’s 
so ridiculous but that it’s becoming 
so widespread.
The election of President Clinton in 
1992 signaled the end of a 12-year con­
servative reign, in popular ideology as 
well as in the White House. Not surpris­
ingly, this put the Republicans off a little. 
However, since then, some regular Re­
publican party members have made it 
their mission to bad-mouth all things 
liberal, making a big deal of every little 
misstep of the Clinton administration 
(not to say the man’s without fault) and 
even going so far as to mock Hillary and 
Chelsea Clinton for the simple crime of 
being related to the President.
Worse, and more disturbing, some 
Republican politicians have been follow­
ing suit, more likely to impress their 
hardline constituents than out of any 
real belief in the evil of all things Demo­
cratic. Read the letters to the editor 
section of a fairly large newspaper and 
you will probably come upon a letter 
that smolders with righteous indigna­
tion about something being an example : 
of “asinine liberal wrong-headedness.” 
Visit a conservative Web page and you 
may see a picture of Hillary Clinton, 
captioned “It Takes A Village Idiot.” 
This is politics — a contest between two 
people of (ostensibly) different philoso­
phies for a public office. You’re not sup­
posed to take it personally. “Liberalism” I 
is not a dirty word just because you don’t 
agree with it. It’s a political philosophy, 
not an invective.
But this sort of immaturity is not just 
stupid-sounding, it’s downright insulting 
to anyone who values the political pro­
cess. One would think that playground 
group dynamics would be beneath the 
dignity of the top legislators of the nation, 
if not the ordinary conservative hardliners. 
By stoopingto taunts and slurs, the elected 
officials of whom I speak lower the dignity 
of the entire process. By using narrow­
minded mocking to make his point, Joe

fields can merge to provide a 
stimulating working environment 
as well as training in a profitable 
cutting-edge career. Increasing 
thenumber of classes and projects 
that combine areas of learning 
which are distinctly separate will 
help students gain knowledge 
through means other than aca­
demic texts.
Student and higher administra­
tive initiative in increasing these 
opportunities is not enough. Indi­
vidual college administrators 
need to be more flexible and open 
to working with other colleges. 
The segregation that exists be­
tween colleges and even depart­
ments at CMU is a major stum­
bling block on the road to inter­
disciplinary learning.
If lack of fiscal resources should 
become a problem, maybe the com­
panies that have been supplying 
the University with grants re­
cently (and others like them) could 
be solicited to help fund inter­
college learning projects. With the 
practical application and ouside 
interest in programs such as HCI, 
we certainly have proof that in­
terdisciplinary education can be 
a lucrative investment.
In order to prepare CMU 
undergrads for real-world 
working situations, we need to 
have more interdisciplinary pro­
grams and projects. If there is 
any place where innovative 
changes in undergraduate course 
selection can occur, surely it is at 
a university as qualified and well- 
rounded as CMU.
Columnist decries retro pop culture
ditor’s Notebook
Perhaps it started with 
Dick Clark. There we were, 
ringing in 1998 by watching 
a well-preserved relic of the 
1950s. I drove home, hum­
ming along to the cheesy 
1980s nostalgia pop playing 
on my car radio, and went 
upstairs, promptly 
ripping over my 
sister’s charming 
disco-era orange plat­
form shoes.
So much of contem­
porary popular culture 
consists of plundering 
the trends of other de­
cades. The fashion, 
music, and catch- 
phrases of the mid- and 
late 1990s resemble 
some kind of retro time 
warp, where we’re end­
lessly revisiting all of 
the trends of the last 
half of the century.
As bright-eyed Ameri­
can youth, it’s our 
right, and even our sa­
cred duty, to develop 
brand spanking new 
trends and force them 
on everyone else.

scholarship, not old togas from 
thrift shops. But that’s a mi­
nor detail. Borrowing cultural 
motifs that past eras thought

sides, it gives you that warm, 
fuzzy nostalgic feeling if ap­
plied correctly.

Renaissance was a mass de­
cision that ancient Greek and 
Roman retro were suddenly 
cool again. Of course, people 
of the Renaissance were 
clothing themselves in long-
accumulated by other 
recent decades.
By now, We’re looking back­
wards to things we actually 
remember when they were 
new. Someone must be 
buying the Schoolhouse 
Rock tapes they’re selling 
on TV and wearing the plastic 
jelly shoes that look as if 
they ought to be lounging 
poolside circa 1985. Any day 
now, I expect a New 
Kids on the Block reunion 
tour to be announced. So 
help us, there’s even a 
grunge music revival.
That we’re looking 
backwards to trends that 
first came to prominence 
during our own puny 
lifetimes shows our pa­
thetic failure of imagi­
nation. We ought to be 
ashamed of ourselves.
In 30 years, when stu­
dents look back towards 
the 1990s for inspira­
tion, they’re going to be 
facing a bewildering ar­
ray of options.
Without much in the 
way of authentically 
1990s trends to steal, 
they’ll have to decide
¦ whether they want to 
resurrect 1950s re­
vival, 1960s revival, 1970s re­
vival, or 1980s revival. How 
will they ever decide? And 
when they do, how will they 
show that their blindingly 
bright polyester outfits pay
being able to delve into the 
back of our parents’ closets 
and pull out clothes as non- 
conformingly retro as those 
of our peers? If this keeps 
up, our children will have 
nothing to copy that hasn’t 
been copied before. If we don’t 
create a new past for them 
to steal, they’ll be stuck 
stealing other things from 
the past or, even more confus­
ingly, stealing what we 
stole from our past.
Maybe, if it’s too much of a 
challenge for us to make up 
our own culture, we should 
try and shoot for ripping c

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 19 January 19987Unabomber trial raises key legal issues
Lawyers, public question mental health
Vy Ty Mai
For 18 years, the man called the 
Unabomber maintained a one-man cru­
sade, bomb by bomb, against the advance 
ofthe “industrial technological system” in 
the interest of reverting the world to a 
more natural state. The motives behind 
the actions indicate amadman at work or, 
even worse, a clinical strategist.
On April 3,1996, Theodore Kaczynsld 
was arrested at his Montana cabin and 
soon charged with possession of bomb 
components. The FBI believed him to be 
the Unabomber,responsibleforthreemur- 
ders and at least 16 bombing attacks.
The terror and the search may have 
ended. But soon, the questions would 
begin. The day after his arrest, when 
asked by a federal court judge if he was 
mentally impaired, Kaczynski answered 
with a concise “no.” Thus began a whirl­
wind of controversial speculation by ex­
perts and non-experts in various fields 
and persistent denial by the defendant.
The question of Kaczynski’s sanity 
is a heated debate. His family main­
tains that Kaczynski had merely had 
a disturbed childhood — he was a 
lonely, highly intelligent child more 
comfortable with his books than with 
his own family. His defense team as­
serts that Kaczynski suffers from 
paranoid schizophrenia and hopes to 
use this mental disorder defense to 
gain an innocent-due-to-insanity ver­
dict from the jury.
Is Kaczynski accountable for the 
crimes he allegedly committed? The 
answer may lie in the crimes them­
selves. Most of the package bombs sent 
to the victims were meticulously 
planned. Some were booby traps, dis­
guised as innocuous notebooks or signs,
as was the case with HughScranton, 
the Unabomber’s first fatality. Found in 
Kaczynski’s Montana cabin were explicit 
joumalsof his activities, a live bomb, and sche­
matic designs and logs of his experiments with 
bombs. So obvious and exacting are his attacks 
that, if convicted, one cannot deny Kaczynski’s 
accountability. Yet despite the seemingcertainty 
of his guilt, the central question of the 
trial remains: Is he insane?
What drives a 
man to quit a 
prestigious 
teaching post to 
live alone in 
Montana’s se­
cluded forests?
Does being 
so close to na­
ture explain 
an interest inpro- 
tecting the envi­
ronment to the 
point of violence?
In Kaczynski's Industrial Society and Its Fu­
ture, which many are now referring to as the 
Unabomber’s Manifesto, he states: “The Indus­
trial Revolution and its consequences have been 
disastrous for the human race and [will] inflict 
greater damage on the natural world.” One 
major news source says that his journal "often 
meander[s] from logical, considered ideas into 
irrational babble."
Obviously, the case of Theodore Kaczynski 
isn’t black and white. They are no definites. 
The question of his sanity will have ramifica­
tions throughout his entire trial, from his 
ability to stand trial — to be determined by 
the judge — to why he might have committed 
the bombing attacks. A court-appointed psy­
chiatrist is expected to wrap up her evalua­
tion of Kaczynski’s mental stability this week. 
Until then, the questions remain.

neering major. She welcomes any responsible

Brother’s aid in capture sets precedent
Thibert
Almost two years ago, DavidKaczynski faced 
a difficult situation. He had a hunch that his 
brother Theodore might be the Unabomber, 
who had killed three people and injured an­
other 23 during an 18-year series of letter- 
bombings. In reality, it 
was more than a hunch 
— he had received some 
letters from his brother 
that closely resembled 
the technology-bashing 
manifesto that the 
Unabomber had forced 
The Washington Postto 
publish in 1995.
David was afraid to 
go to the authorities 
with his information — 
Tenaya Sims/Tartan Art Staff he realized that Ted 
would almost certainly be punished for his 
crimes, and while this he could handle, what if 
the justice system went so far as to pursue 
capital punishment? Imagine the guilt he would 
feel if he were responsible for his own brother’s 
death. He did, however, realize the importance 
of keeping Ted out of society, so that he would 
not be able to hurt or kill any others. So, after 
weighing the options, he decided to give the 
Feds the information—butonly afteritseemed 
clear thatTedwouldnotfacethedeathpenalty.
BasedonDavid’sinformation,TedKaczynski 
was captured and held for trial. However, 
David’s conditions were ignored. The Justice 
Department and Attorney General Reno de­
cided to pursue the death penalty.
Now although the Justice Department is 
currently considering accepting a plea bar­
gain from Ted Kaczynski, David’s original 
conditions are playing no part in the matter, 
and Ted may in fact end up facing, the death 
penalty if his plea is not accepted. In short, 
the FBI is blatantly disregarding the condi­
tions that David believed were in effect. 
This disregard will only discourage people 
from turning in criminal loved ones in the 
future for fear that they might, if capital 
punishment is pursued, be responsible for 
their loved ones’ eventual deaths.
If they could receive some sort of guaran­
tee that capital punishment wouldn’t be 
pursued, then they would be far more will­
ing to implicate their murderous loved ones 
(who could quite reasonably kill again) for 
society’s benefit.
However, does the FBI (or any police 
agency) have the right to make this sort of 
promise and ensure that the court adheres 
to it? If an agency did so, it would effectively 
be removing a sentencing option from the 
court without any consent from the court 
itself. This seems like a direct interference 
ofanexecutive agency with ajudicial agency, 
but these concerns need to be overlooked in 
these instances.
It’s clear that dangerous criminals have 
to be captured by whatever means neces­
sary, and if this means that a promise 
against capital punishment has to be 
made, then so be it. The benefit of having 
the criminals off the streets far outweighs 
the need to execute them — and the court 
would still be able to sentence the offend­
ers to life in prison without infringing on 
the promise. All we’d lose is the ability to 
put criminals to death in certain cases. In 
exchange, we could save countless lives 
by encouraging relatives or friends of 
killers to turn their loved ones in.
Without promises, we might kill one per­
son, whom we could just as easily put away 
for life; with promises, we could save count­
less innocent lives. It’s clear that the latter 
option is far preferable, and we can only 
hope that the FBI is not setting a precedent 
by ignoring David Kaczynski’s conditions.

hWÊÊm*Dave Liber
The recent decision of Presi­
dent Cohon to cancel afternoon 
classes beginning next year in 
observance ofMartin Luther King 
Day represents a compromise on 
his part to' the University.
Student Senate has tried to 
convince the University that can­
celing all classes on this day is 
the only fair and respectful way 
in which to provide students the 
time and energy to take, part in 
the observance of MLK Day.
However, even though Student 
Senate is completely correct on 
this account, Faculty Senate has 
voiced their loud concern over 
giving the students a three-day 
weekend out of fear that students 
will, as President Cohon sug-. 
gested, “simply have an excuse to 
go home,” or wake up hung over 
on Monday morning from an all- 
night kegger.
I freely admit that, given the 
opportunity, there are some stu­
dents who might go home for the 
weekend. There also might be 
some students who will use the 
day off as an excuse to party. 
However, these two facts do not 
provide ample argument against
what can only be described as the 
proper observance of MLK Day
— a full day off.
President Cohon suggests that 
there are still more reasons against 
the full-day observance ofMLKDay
— onebeingthatin a survey of other 
“Research One schools” (top research 
universities) President Cohon did 
not find a “large enough majority” of 
schools that granted their students 
the day off. Heaven forbid CMU do 
anything revolutionary or not in 
the majority.
Granting students a half day is 
a fitting compromise between the 
Student Senate .request for the 
day off and the status quo of non- 
observance. However, itisinmany 
ways a trivialization of what this 
day means. The message the Uni­
versity now sends is that MLK 
Day is important to them, but not 
enough that they should cancel 
classes for the entire day. It also 
says that the University, and in 
particular, the Faculty Senate, 
does not have enough trust or faith 
in students to grant us the entire 
day off without the threat of see­
ing a mass exodus of students leav­
ing CMU like the Jews from Egypt 
or having the Cut littered with 
passed-out drunkards Mon­
day morning.
While I would most assuredly 
like to see the latter happen, I can
guarantee the Faculty Senate that 
my dream of mass public intoxica­
tion at CMU will never be fulfilled. 
I would think.the real question here 
is not whether CMU students are 
mature enough to celebrate MLK 
Day in an appropriate way, but 
rather how the Faculty Senate could 
be so untrusting and doubtful.
I would suggest that CMU give 
all students the day off and see 
what happens. If the Faculty Sen­
ate is correct and CMU turns into a 
deserted Gommorah dining that 
weekend, I will be the first to sug­
gest we have classes on MLK Day. 
However, if instead, we see stu­
dents stay on campus and celebrate 
this great day by participation and 
discussion, I would think we would 
have proven ourselves mature 
enough to have every MLK Day off.
Perhaps there should be a test cel­
ebration, in order for us students to 
prove ourselves, ratherthan a cancel­
lation of afternoon classes for a trivial 
celebration. Even though having to 
prove ourselves to Faculty Senate 
and the University administration 
would be offensive in the extreme, it 
might be the only way.
Now, about CMlTs refusal to cel­
ebrate Groundhog Day....

Columnist catches flight to hockey heaven
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
I just had what I’d call a dream 
vacation. I went home and saw 
my high school play. High school 
hockey in New England — my old 
coach still smokes between peri­
ods whenever the team isn’t do­
ing well. But even with a 3-2 loss 
to a much stronger Class A school, 
the young players on the team 
were ushered off the ice by loud, 
supportive cheers from their fam­
ily and friends.
An old teammate asked me to 
come to New Hampshire to help 
out with his Midget team. He was 
coaching three girls and needed 
my help on getting them to hit. I 
went to practice in the middle of 
a snowstorm. One girl showed 
up, and we spent the hour talking 
about how she was following the 
puck too much with her eyes. We 
didn’t even talk about hitting. 
Male coaches pinpoint different 
holes in their players’ skills than 
female coaches. The girl wasn’t 
afraid of the other guys, she was 
too busy watching the puck — 
but that’s beside the point.
I also went to Colorado to visit 
my family. I went to the Denver 
Cup and saw University of New 
Hampshire beat up on Colorado 
College. I saw the Air Force Acad­
emy, with 2,000 fans cheering 
the fight song, beat St. Olaf Col­
lege 8-1.1 watched Colorado Col­
lege, then ranked fifth in the coun­
try, workout on a Friday after­
noon. I watched the women’s 
Olympic team, which was in Colo­
rado Springs training at the ex­
treme altitude of over 6,000 feet, 
work out the next night. I was in
ecstasy, or as one friend would 
later comment, “hockey heaven.”
But if those days were foreplay, 
I lost it on the plane ride home. I 
got a seat in the back of the plane, 
stowed my skates in the over­
head compartment and settled 
into my lonely seat. In five min­
utes, the back of the plane was 
full of blonde, teenage boys, jab­
bering to each other in what 
sounded like a combi­
nation of Russian,
French, and Ger­
man. It was 
Finnish. It was, 
in fact, the 
Finnish na­
tional hockey 
team (17 
and under) 
returning 
from a tour­
nament in 
Canada.
The head 
coach sat 
right down 
next to me, 
almost killing him­
self with my skates 
when he went to open ' 
the overhead to store 
his briefcase.
“You play hockey?” he 
asked me as he sat down. I smiled.
There are 40,000 hockey play­
ers in Finland and about 100 
rinks. There are 600,000 hockey 
players in the United States and 
more than 100 rinks in the state 
of Maine alone. One of the big­
gest hockey pressures in Finland 
is the fight for the premier teams 
to get ice time. I agreed. In high 
school, we played at 5 am. The 
college team has a great game 
spot at 8 pm on Saturdays, but 
last semester we did play at Penn 
State (a three-hour drive) at 11:30 
pm on a Friday night — and we 
had to come home at 6 am and 
play a game the next evening. 
No, it’s not easy to get ice any­
where, unless you’re in the NHL.
There is just never enough.
I asked if any parents of play­
ers had made the trip overseas. 
He said no, and explained that in 
Europe, parents do not make up 
the fan base. Hockey fans do. 
Parents let their children do it on 
their own — their separate thing, 
their realm. That there is little
system supports athletics as a 
part of the whole program in 
learning — not as the paramount 
element. You can be an athlete 
and a scholar in the U.S. and 
Canada. You can’t in Finland. 
And, if you don’t make it profes­
sionally, you get really screwed 
when you have nothing to fall
involvement on their part was 
disturbing to him.
Another upsetting thing was 
the way that European players, 
when they are 14 and 15, will 
start to practice and play 20 or 
more hours a week. Now, I know 
guys who say that they’d like 
more ice time, but when you’re 
that young, too much creates a 
strange dependency. When it 
comes to school, if the boys are 
tired after an early workout, they 
just don’t go. He acknowledged 
that this would never happen in 
North America, and he was envi­
ous of the way that our education

back on later down the line.
We discussed the idea of break­
ing down offensive drills into units 
of three players instead of five, 
because when three play together, 
they play as a team and have to 
scramble to cover open positions 
more. When five play together, 
someone gets lazy and everyone 
lapses into zone defense. He drew 
diagrams on a cocktail napkin on 
the back of the seat in front of him 
to show me. Bliss.
“Coaches in the U.S., they tell 
the player when he is doing some­
thing right, before they tell him 
when he is doing something wrong.
In Finland, we spend so much 
time yelling at them for the wrong 
things that sometimes players 
think that they are never doing 
anything right,” he confessed.
He was shocked when I told 
him that most of us think that 
Europeans are beautiful, fast 
skaters. He protested, “We’re no 
faster, just use the ice better.” 
The Finns start playing 
seriously at 13. Some 
have signed provi­
sional contracts by 
15. The national 
squad practices 
and plays to­
gether only 26 
days a year, 
but for the 
other 11- 
and-a-half 
months, 
they are 
with their 
regional 
teams in 
Finland. 
There are 
90 players 
in the pro­
gram and 
this squad 
was their 
elite force. 
This is a tight 
contrast to the over 
100 players that live, 
eat, go to school and train to­
gether in Ann Arbor for the U.S. 
national squad.
He liked that idea more. I liked 
his idea more.
Some referees’ calls in the Ca­
nadian tournament, to him, were 
somewhat suspect. “Is it not in­
terference when you have not had 
the puck for five seconds and 
someone comes up and hits you?” 
I tried not to chuckle as I thought 
of all the comments that Ameri­
cans and Canadians make about 
dirty Europeans. “How about 
checking from behind,” he asked. 
I cringed.
I told him that the Canadian- 
U.S. rivalry was heating up. We 
both trashed on the new Olym­
pic system, playing with profes­
sionals and interrupting the 
NHL regular season.
“Who are your rivals?” I asked.
He looked stern. “Swedes. 
There is a saying: It is all right to 
lose, until you lose to Sweden.” I 
thought about Ulf Samuellson. I 
cringed again.
We talked on about mental ver­
sus physical training, playbooks, 
and athletic diaries. Then, sud­
denly, the plane had landed. We 
had spent three hours talking 
shop. As we stood up together, I 
noticed that the group of play­
ers, coaches, trainers, and man­
agers were all looking at us. He 
said something to them in Finn­
ish, and they began a heated 
discussion.
“They’re talking about me, 
aren’t they?”
“Yes. They don’t believe me 
when I tell them that you are 
involved in hockey. It is just 
unheard of in Finland for a 
woman to get involved in a man’s 
sport, especially ice hockey,” his 
voice lilts. I decided not to tell 
him just how taboo it was in the 
U.S. too.
I lifted my skates up for them 
to see. More animated chatter.
“They say,” he said, breaking 
into a wide smile and turning 
back towards me to translate, 
“they say that they’d like very 
much for you to switch cultures, 
for a little while.”

Guru predicts Broncos’ triumph in XXXII
The Pigskin Pundit
by Chris Cannon
There are a lot of jokes about the 
Super Bowl. What’s the difference be­
tween (fill in AFC champion) and 
Wheaties? Punchline: Wheaties belong 
in a bowl. Why was (AFC team’s) flight 
back to (AFC city) delayed? Punchline: 
Someone painted the landing strip like
losing to Oakland 25-28, Kansas City 
22-24, and Pittsburgh 24-35 on the road 
the past three months, Denver avenged 
each of their conference losses this sea­
son by whipping the Raiders 31-3 in 
week 13 and then by winning their last 
two playoff games by a total of just seven 
points. As a bonus the Broncos enacted 
reciprocity on Jacksonville for their 27- 
30 playoff loss last year, teeing off on the 
three-year club 42-17 in their wild-card 
playoff game.
For the fifth and final stop, Denver 
was all set to pay back San Francisco for 
serving them their last defeat on De­
cember 15. Denver led 10-0 late in the 
first half before Jerry Rice, resurrected 
from injury, sacrificed his knee cap to 
score the Niners’ first touchdown and 
help pull them back to a 34-17 blowout
an endzone, and it took the (AFC nick­
name) three hours to find it. One man in 
Green Bay has a dog that barks the 
national anthem whenever the NFC wins 
the Super Bowl. What does the dog bark 
when the AFC wins? Punchline: Who 
knows, the dog is only 13 years old. But 
this year, the AFC has an advantage: 
anger. The Denver Broncos are pissed, 
and it’s all the Packers’ fault.
You see, the Broncos finished the 
fourth stop on their revenge tour with 
last week’s win over the Steelers. After
Mark Adato/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
win. But Green Bay ruined all that when 
they marched into 3Com park and won 
the NFC Championship and, in most 
minds, the real Super Bowl. Not so fast 
says this pundit.
Despite popular delight that quarter­
back John Elway doesn’t perform well in 
the big game and the fact that his comple­
tion percentage, yardage, and touch- 
down-to-interception ratio has worsened 
in each Super Bowl — the problem hasn’t 
been Elway. It’s the Bronco secondary. 
The team knew Joe Montana would
shred the secondary in Super Bowl XXTV 
because Elway did it all week in prac­
tice. In three Super Bowls, the opposing 
quarterback has averaged a 74 comple­
tion percentage, 306 yards, and four 
touchdowns per game. But this year, the 
Broncos’ pass defense only gave up 
179 yards per game, making them 
fourth in the league.
Denver has other factors in their fa­
vor. Green Bay’s last two victories last 
year came mostly on the legs of Super 
Bowl XXXI MVP Desmond Howard. 
Howard ran for most of the yards on the 
first two touchdowns in the NFC title 
game and broke the Super Bowl open 
with a third-quarter kick return. This 
year’s deadly return man is the Broncos’ 
Darrien Gordon. Gordon has scored four 
TDs this year, three on punt returns.
The past two seasons the Packers have 
largely been a paper champion. Much 
like the Houston Rockets’ NBA champi­
onships during Michael Jordan’s semi- 
retirement, the Packers never beat the 
incredibly collapsing Cowboys in the 
playoffs. After beating up on the 49ers 
(no running game), Panthers, Bucca­
neers, and Patriots (three inexperienced 
clubs) the past two years, the Broncos 
will be the first complete team the Pack­
ers have played in the playoffs.
But most importantly, the Broncos 
have TD: Terrell Davis. Despite the 
great quarterbacks (Elway, Boomer 
Esiason, Jim Kelly, Dan Marino) the 
AFC has fielded in the past decade, the 
conference has always been about run­
ning backs. Runners like Jim Brown,
O.J. Simpson, Earl Campbell, Franco 
Harris, Thurman Thomas, and the last 
AFC Super Bowl MVP, Marcus Allen, 
have been what the AFC is all about. 
Davis was on pace for 2,000 yards for 
most of the season before sitting out 
most of the last two games and finish­
ing with 1,750 yards.
When Davis lives up to his initials 
next Sunday, the joke will be on the NFC 
and anyone who bets on the Packers and 
their 13.5 point spread.

science major who spends an awful lot of

from Shaunnessey, and an offensive 
rebound and put-back shot from 
Praesel. With 11:47 left, Shaunnessey 
received a cut to the bridge of his nose 
while trying to save the ball from going 
out of bounds and had to leave the game 
for a short time.
CMU continued to get points on the 
offensive end, but Kenyon stayed close by 
consistently scoring from inside the paint. 
At one point the Tartan lead was reduced 
to two points, but baskets from junior 
center Dan Bowersox, three more three- 
pointers from Sofish, and a three-pointer 
from Praesel helped CMU to a 37-31 lead 
with four minutes left. Kenyon called a 
time-out to regroup for the remainder of
the half, and despite an additional three- 
pointer from senior guard LaDale- 
Widmeyer, Kenyon was able to close the 
gap between the teams for a halftime; 
score of 42-39 with CMU winning. |
The second half started well for the?. 
Tartans as Sofish dropped anothei: 
bomb from three-point land. Five min‘| 
utes into the second half, CMU had a 
six-point lead at 53-47. Two minutes 
later, CMU got a nine-point lead when 
Widmeyer hit his second three-point 
shot of the game and the team’s eighth 
of the night. For five minutes, CMU. 
held its lead with good rebounding and 
solid defense. n
Only eight-and-a-half minutes re-, 
mained in the game when Kenyon be© 
gan to climb back. In the next four 
minutes of play, Kenyon reduced the 
CMU lead from 10 points to four. Feel* 
ing no pressure, McNutt scored twice 
in a row to push the Tartans to a 74^6& 
lead when Kenyon called a time-out. ¡% 
Kenyon was able to draw a few fouls 
from CMU though, and with 45 sec-, 
onds left, the score was 75-73. The. 
Tartans began to run the clock down,, 
but a nine-second difference between 
the shot clock and the game clock meant 
that they would have to shoot and posr 
sibly give Kenyon a chance to tie. They, 
did that with just 14 seconds left in the 
game,hut Kenyon turned the ball over.,:

Widmeyer hit the first shot, ensuring 
that even if Kenyon made a three$!

the game, and when Widmeyer missed; 
the second shot, Kenyon had one more 
chance. A running three-pointer from, 
nearly half-court missed, and CMU held,

Majernik had 12 and 10 points, 
respectively. Again, O’Leary led 
the team with nine rebounds. The 
team also excelled at the free- 
throw line, going 12 of 15.
“We were ecstatic about that,” 
said Seidl. “[It was] the most team 
effort in any game played to date.”
CMU has faced a wide array of 
opponents in the past month and 
a half. The team beat Waynesburg
College 55-43 on the _________
road on January 6.
Senior guard Marcelle 
Steele led the Tartans 
with 13 total points 
and three three-point- 
ers, and Perretta had 
12 points. The Tar­
tans placed second in zzz=====z 
the Pitt-Bradford 
KOA Speer Classic on January 
2-3. In the opening match, CMU 
trashed the Goucher College Go­
phers 62-28. Majernik hit the 
hoop hard and often with 14 
points, and freshman guard Sara 
Eicher contributed 11 points of 
her own. The team brought their 
game against Goucher, shooting 
45 percent overall and 71 percent 
from the free-throw line. The 
Tartans tackled the hosting Pitt-
Bradford Panthers in the cham­
pionship match of the tourney, 
but the Panthers made short work 
of CMU, crushing them 46-67. 
The CMU team continued their 
excellence at the free-throw line, 
sinking 14 of 20 shots. However, 
Pitt shut down the CMU attack, 
leaving the Tartans shooting 25 
percent overall and an anemic 10 
percent from the perimeter. 
Majernik again led the team with

ment MVP status. Way back in 
December, Allegheny College 
edged out the Tartans at home 
(66-62), CMU lost to UAA oppo­
nent Emory on the road (75-62), 
and split a pair of home match­
ups, beating Grove City (53-33) 
and losing to UAA adversary Case 
Western (50-69).
In the beginning of the season, 
the women’s team established a
strong running game, rotating, 
players quickly in and out of the ; 
action so that they could main- ! 
tain a fast pace.
Lately, the team has been slow- ! 
ing that game down to develop a i 
strong half-court attack as well.} 
“We’d like to maintain our run-1 
ning game, but it’s best to have à 
combination,” said Seidl. One of - 
the most, defining aspects of this; 
season’s team is the fact that thè •
__________ talent is distributed {
throughout the rosV \ 
ter. “We definitely { 
don’t have a star?”! 
said Seidl. “I likèi; 
that. It’s nice to}

ries of UAA match-ups. In the ! 
University Athletic Association : 
conference, Washington Univerr I

Johns Hopkins University, and :

Seidl. “That doesn’t mean that!;

it doesn’t mean that you can overi- j

Over the past month, CMU men’s bas­
ketball played eight games with a record 
of 3-5 to bring their season record to 5- 
8. The team’s month began poorly on 
December 6 against UAA opponent
as close in front of the home crowd, and 
they lost their eighth game of the season.
The game started with Thiel jumping 
out to a 19-35 lead. An eight-point run 
in the last four minutes of the half al­
lowed Thiel to build the comfortable 16- 
point margin. The half was punctuated 
by CMU’s poor rebounding, inability to

Emory University when they lost 68-41. 
The team only shot 23 percent in the 
first half and was not able to produce a 
second half that could bring them back 
into it. The next day, the team played 
Division I opponent Davidson College, 
who beat the Tartans 91-46.
Point Loma Nazarene College proved 
to be a better match for CMU on January 
2 when CMU won 70-64. The team had a 
35-32 halftime lead and was able to hang 
on for the win. Thé next day CMU won its 
second straight against Cal Tech: The 
Tartans thrashed them 61-46. Senior 
forward and co-captain Colin 
Shaunnessey and junior guard Tommy 
Praesel each had 12 points, freshman 
guard David Burns had 11, and fresh­
man forward Geoff Barbanell had 10.
The University of Rochester drew an­
other notch in CMU’s loss column as the 
Tartans fell 66-55 despite senior for­
ward and co-captain Andy Sofish’s 19 
points. LaRoche was CMU’s last oppo­
nent before the beginning of the new 
semester. CMU lost 67-66 on a last- 
second shot despite leading at halftime 
and getting a 14 point night from Sofish.
Last Tuesday night the men’s basket­
ball team played at home against Thiel 
College for the first game of this semes­
ter. Last year the Tartans were able to 
split a pair of games against Thiel with 
each team winning on the road. This 
year the Tartans were not able to keep it

first three minutes. They closed a 12-2 
run with an alley-oop dunk that forced 
Carnegie Mellon to call a time-out.
With a commanding 47-21 lead, Thiel 
substituted four of their players and 
began trying to waste time by using a 
methodical, slow paced offense. CMU, 
on the other hand, had not given up, and 
junior center Dan Bowersox earned a 
trip to the free throw line and hit two of 
two shots to begin what would be CMU’s 
only substantial run of the night. CMU 
successfully used a half-court trap to 
force a turnover from Thiel and switched 
its defense to a 3-2 zone. The changes 
allowed CMU to recapture some of the 
momentum which had been so decid­
edly not in their favor up to this point. 
Over the next six minutes of play, CMU 
closed the gap to 47-32. Unfortunately, 
when Thiel scored at 10:45 to break its 
drought, it also marked the end of CMU’s 
comeback. For the remainder of the game 
the Tartans only managed one more 
point while Thiel added 14 to the 
scoreboard for a final score of 63-33.
Last Friday, the basketball team 
played another home game against 
Kenyon College. The team needed to 
perform better than they had the pre­
ceding game to hope for a win. Rebound­
ing and offensive penetration were two 
areas which needed desperate improve­
ment for the Tartans to beat Kenyon.
Four minutes into the half, Sofish hit 
two three-point shots in a row. At the 
15-minute mark, Praesel hit another 
three for CMU. Kenyon was able to keep

The women’s basketball season 
stands at the midpoint this weekend, 
as the team has played nine match­
ups since the CMU Tip-off Tourney 
which kicked off the season back at the 
end of November. The team’s record 
has advanced to 6-6 overall and 1-2 in 
the UAA. The Tartan bench is particu­
larly deep this season, and the team 
has used that to its advantage. “We 
have a pretty well-rounded team in 
that we don’t have any stars,” said 
coach Geri Seidl. “Any given day, it 
could be any player.”
Most recently, the team lost on the 
road to .Grove City College on 
Thursday, 50-36. “We didn’t bring our
was bad,” said Seidl. “It was ugly.” 
The loss to Grove City came after a 
strong win against Thiel. College on 
Tuesday. The Tartans held the 
LadyCats to only eleven points in the 
first half, and just fended off a second- 
half Thiel surge to claim the win, 46- 
40. “It was a nice victory for us,” said 
Seidl. Sophomore guard Lacey Perretta 
led the Tartan drive with nine points, 
assisted by Majernik’s eight points and 
senior forward Katie O’Leary’s five 
points. O’Leary also fueled the Tartan 
defense, leading the team with 10 re­
bounds. Despite a strong defensive 
game, the Tartans still struggled offen­
sively. The team finished the game 
shooting 26 percent — a significant 
downturn from the 36 percent that the 
team had been averaging.
game,” said Seidl. “We were having a 
bad shooting night.”
The Tartans suffered all night, shoot­
ing only 21 percent in the first half, and 
28 percent for the game. The team was 
also unable to convert from outside, as 
the perimeter players ended the evening 
sinking only 13 percent of their shots. 
The team’s weak outside game allowed 
the Grove City defense to clamp down 
under the hoop and focus on shutting 
down Tartan drives to the inside. De­
spite the increased pressure, sopho­
more forward Samantha Majernik 
managed to penetrate to the hoop to 
lead the Tartan scoring drive.
“If you’re having a bad shooting night, 
you have to step your defense up*” said 
Seidl. However, the Tartans were also 
not able to stop the Wolverine offen­
sive. Grove City beat the Tartans on 
rebounds, and CMU was weak at the 
free-throw line, going five for 13. “It

Thus far, the highlight of the season 
has been the January 8 home game 
against UAA foe University of Roches­
ter. The Tartans rolled over the 
Yellowjackets, running the scoreboard 
to a 58-41 victory.
“The Rochester game had everything 
going,” said Seidl. “We ran a little, we 
had a nice half-court game.... We scored 
off lots of different options.”
The Tartans were able to constantly 
keep the Rochester team off-balance, 
switching the game style to keep their 
opponents’ heads spinning. “[That style] 
is hard for a defense to play against 
because they can’t pack it in or spread 
out,” said Seidl. The Rochester game 
was certainly one for the record books, 
as three CMU players were able to 
score in double digits. Sophomore guard 
Sherry Cribbins had a career-high 18 
points for the game, and O’Leary and

Returning home leads some students abroadWriter loses bag, finds 
new culture in Ghana
By DANIEL ARP
Tartan Contributing Editor
For most students, winter 
break is a time to go home or 
visit relatives, not a time to take 
vacations. But for students like 
Claudio Neves, who live or have 
relatives out­
side the United 
States, it may ap­
pear to be a time 
for both.
Neves, a sopho­
more mechanical 
engineering major, 
spent much of his 
winter break bask­
ing on the beach 
two blocks from his 
house in San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
“It’s like in the 
high eighties,”
Neves said. “The 
lowest it might get 
is 76. And [the 
Puerto Ricans] are ... complain­
ing that it’s cold. And it is winter 
down there.”
“My friends up here say, ‘Oh, I 
: should have gone to Puerto Rico,’ ” 
said Neves. “They’re kind of jeal­
ous that I get to get away like
[be]come closer. It’s probably 
most similar to Thanksgiving [in 
the US].... You don’t usually 
stay closed up [with] your imme­
diate family.”
Neves spent Christmas day at 
his aunt’s house along with his 
cousin’s family. For New Year’s

Did you know that there is a place 
where you can do anything from lying on 
a warm, sunny beach, snorkeling, and 
scuba diving to going mountain climb­
ing and skiing? Sandra Slaughter, a 
professor of information systems in the 
Graduate School of Industrial Adminis­

verse paradise in Hawaii.
Remarkably, Hawaii not only has the 
mviting blue water, swaying palm trees, 
and beautiful Hula dancers that we pic­

but it also has snow-covered mountains 
and active volcanoes.

Christmas morning I woke up 
in my boxer shorts. Soaking wet.
On a beach. In Africa. There were 
no gifts under the palm tree. I 
didn’t mind a bit.
A friend of mine from high 
school whom I hadn’t laid 
eyes on in two and a half 
years sent me email one day 
asking if I would be inter­
ested in going to Ghana. Well, 
duh. The only catch was that 
the plane fare alone would 
cost $1400. So, in an attempt 
to reduce my expenses by 
more than a third, last se­

But I went anyway. The toi­
lets were great.
On the way there, I learned 
about Ghana. Located on the west 
“Gold Coast,” it was the first Afri- 
•< can nation to gaiinindependehce 
from Great Britain in 1954. About 
48 languages are in use, but the 
primary ones are English and

Professor finds paradise in extreme diversity of Big Island
One of the highlights of

visit to Mauna Loa, a 
mountain located on the 
Big Island
“I actually climbed 
13,000 i^eetL. to the top of 
the mountainwhere there 
is snow,” she said. Slaugh­
ter explained that a foot 
of snow fell on Mauna Loa 
the day she arrived in Ha­
waii. However, this snow­
fall didn’t deter Slaugh­
ter, who describes herself 
as an “active and adven- 
turous’ traveler,” from 
making the j ourney to the • 
top of the mountain.

boat and first we just 
saw a couple of 
whales and we fol­
lowed them and 
ended up in a pod of 
whales,” she said. Al­
though Slaughter 
was excited to see 
the whales, the boat 
had to turn back be­
cause it was not a 
designated whale- 
watching boat.
Slaughter said 
that the best way 
to enjoy the Big Is­
land itself was just 
to get in thé car 
and drive around. 
“We went to Volcano 
National Park on 
the Big Island.... 
You can watch the 
lava fill in on the volcanoes, and that’s 
kind of cool,” she said.
The exceptional preservation of the 
Big Island also caught Slaughter’s at­
tention. “It’s very unspoiled and
untouristed, and that’s what I like about 
it,” she said. “You can driye around the 
island, and you can see small villages.... 
It’s not all freeways.”
This respect for nature was also evi­
dent.’in some of the signs . Slaughter 
observed while she traveled around the 
island. For example, a sign directly out­
side the airport warned drivers to yield 
to donkeys crossing the road.
“We didn’t see any donkeys.... You also 
have to be careful when you’re driving 
because geese also cross the street,” said 
Slaughter. Although Slaughter was de­
layed by some geese in the middle of the 
road, she simply used the time to take 
some pictures.
Although Slaughter has no specific 
plans for any adventures in the near 
future, she would like to spend some 
time in San Diego.
“I’m also contemplating a conference in 
Helsinki, but it may be too cold,” she said.
While the climate of Helsinki may be 
too cold for most people to bear, Slaugh­
ter recommends a trip to Hawaii to ev­
eryone. “If you like a variety of outdoor 
activities, it’s wonderful,” she said.

Service opportunities, speeches honor King’s birthday
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Personnel Manager
It is a day to reflect on where we have 
been, to celebrate where we are, and to 
remember where we must go. Today, 
Martin Luther King Day will be ob­
served around the nation to honor and 
commemorate the sacrifices made by a 
man who dedicated his life to making 
the world a better place. Although classes 
will not be canceled, Student Life and a 
few dedicated faculty and students have 
made an effort to provide a way for 
members of the campus community to 
observe this day together.
On Monday afternoon, faculty, staff, 
and students will be given the opportu­
nity to participate in a variety of com­
munity service activities, including 
projects at Light of Life Ministries, the 
Jewish Community Center, Indepen­
dence Court, East End Cooperative Min­
istry, and Children’s Hospital. While 
some of these activities will involve di­
rect and personal interactions with those
in need, others will consist of a more 
indirect contribution.
According to Kevin Hughes, coordina­
tor of Student Life for leadership devel­
opment and organizer of these events, a 
wide range of projects is being offered so 
that people can contribute to the com­
munity in the way in which they feel 
most comfortable. The main objective of 
offering these service opportunities is to 
remind us of King’s message of bringing 
people together for a common goal.
“I hope students gain a renewed inter­
est in serving others, think about their 
role in their communities, and stop and 
think about what they can do to better 
other people’s lives,” said Hughes. “In 
addition, I hope they have fun, get a 
break from the rigors of campus, and 
interact with other members of the com­
munity on a different level.”
After the service opportunities, the 
celebration will continue with a candle­
light vigil led by Kathleen Minadeo 
Johnson, associate provost for academic 
projects, at 4:30 pm by the Fence. Dr.
Kenya Dworkin, assistant professor of 
Spanish and the emcee for the day’s 
events, points out that by having the 
festivities begin at such a public place 
like the Fence, the University is sending 
out a message that this is an important 
event that should be celebrated publicly 
and collectively.
“It is my hope that the positive spirit 
and energy that has been kindled around 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday 
and its celebration carries over into the 
rest of the year. His own fearless dedica­
tion to both an ideal and a way of life for 
all of us should be an inspiration for us 
to commit ourselves to contribute, give 
of ourselves to our families, communi­
ties, and society at large,” said Dworkin.
Following this ceremony, a program 
entitled “Remember! Celebrate! Act! A 
day on, not a day off!” will take place in 
Rangos Hall. The program will include 
speeches by Provost Dr. Paul Christiano, 
graduate industrial administration stu­
dent Vanessa Hill, and freshman math 
major Zalenda Cyrille, as well as a key­
note address by Dr. Susan K. McElroy,. 
assistant professor of education and eco­
nomic policy. These events are intended 
not only to- recall the contributions of 
King, but also to suggest to the commu­
nity that now is a time to follow in his 
footsteps and make a change.
“We are not necessarily honoring a 
man who fought for civil rights; we are 
honoring the spirit of equality, dignity, 
and freedom,” said Cyrille.
As a sign of the significance of these 
events, President Cohon has asked that 
students who wish to participate in com­
munity service be excused from class 
and suggested that staff members who 
wish to take time off to participate in the 
celebration be allowed to do so.
“I think it is a very good idea to com­
memorate Martin Luther King [Jr.] s 
life and what beliefs he represented, 
said Meredith Veysey, a freshman mu- 
sic major. “It is a good way for members 
of the campus community to take time 
apart from our lives to reflect on a part 
of history that still affects us today-

ON CAMPUS
------------------------------------------—Music professor reflects on dual career
When visiting Andres Cardenes, 
professor of violin, at his home, 
you are likely to be greeted by 
Aceituna, his two-year-old, ener­
getic Rottweiler. Cardenes says 
that when he first got her, the dog 
looked like a black olive and that 
was what inspired the name: it’s 
Spanish for black olive. Both 
share a love of music and possess 
a friendly, approachable nature, 
although some may find the dog a 
little friendlier than they expect.
This past weekend, Cardenes 
conducted the Pittsburgh Sym­
phony Orchestra, in which he 
holds the Rachel Mellon Walton 
endowed chair. Last semester, he 
was also named to the Dorothy 
Richard Starling and Alexander 
C. Speyer Jr. chair in the School 
of Music, making him the first 
musician in Pittsburgh to hold 
two endowed chairs.
He has appeared with more than 
50 major orchestras worldwide 
and performed in nearly every 
cultural center in the world. The Tartan 
caught up to him to ask him to share 
some reflections on his career as a musi­
cian and as a teacher.
The Tartan: How does it feel to be the 
first musician in Pittsburgh to hold two 
endowed chairs?
Andres Cardenes: It’s a great honor to 
be held in that high esteem by two differ­
ent organizations. I’m very happy about 
it, obviously, but it doesn’t change any­
thing for me, because I’m still going to 
work hard to do the best I can do. It’s a 
nice recognition of my accomplishments.
TT: Looking back on your career as a 
musician, what was your most memo­
rable performance and why?
AC: That’s a hard one. I’ve had a lot of 
memorable performances on a lot of 
memorable occasions.
Liserce ivimer-uixon/ larcan uarKroom manager
Cardenes has been teaching violin at the university level for over 20 years, starting when he was 19.
The finals of the Tchaikovsky compe­
tition in Moscow in 1982 come to mind. 
At the time, Moscow was a major music 
mecca for violinists, and the Tchaikovsky 
competition was the most prestigious 
competition in the world. The Russian 
public was renowned as the most edu­
cated and most receptive audience in 
the world. So, I was happy to be in the 
finals, and to perform with the Moscow 
Philharmonic, and winning second prize 
was a big thrill. This competition has 
been going on for 40 to 50 years, and 
many of the world’s greatest violinists 
have won prizes in it.
TT: How about your career as a profes­
sor? Did you have any memorable expe­
riences teaching in general, or with par­
ticular students?
AC: Every day, with every student, 
there is a memorable experience or a
memorable lesson. Nothing stands out 
about a particular student because the 
science of teaching doesn’t just work; it 
needs to be built up over time. Usually, 
it’s very difficult to assess your work or 
a student’s work until a good deal of time 
has passed — around two to four years 
— and you just keep going until the 
result you have is extremely positive.
TT: Tell me about working with Josef 
Gingold [a well-known violinist whom 
Cardenes studied under and later 
taught with].
AC: You’d need about 12 hours for me 
to do that.
TT: The highlights?
AC: It was an honor and a privilege to 
study with a legend in his own time. I 
can honestly say that just about every 
aspect of my musical life, and much of 
my personal life, was modeled after his
examples. Every day, he in. 
spired and drove me to ac- 
complish my best, and he was 
a great humanitarian.
I was lucky because I lived 
next door to him and saw him 
almost every night, had j 
drink, and talked about the 
violin until the wee hours of 
the morning.
When I was learning with 
him, we became very clo 
friends, and afterwards, \ 
were like father and son. The 
greatest use of a life is to 
spend it on something that 
outlasts it, and that’s some­
thing that he did.
TT: In 1996, you donatedla 
Stradivarius violin to the 
School of Music. Describe how 
it felt to help students in such 
a profound way.
AC: The reason I did it v 
to put the school on an inter­
national musical map. You 
need to have these kinds of 
donations made for students to succeed. 
Since CMU has provided me with i 
environment in which to pursue my goals 
and teaching, when I was presented with 
the opportunity to make such a donation, 
I had several institutions in mind, butl 
kept coming back to CMU since it’s where 
I’ve spent most of my time teaching.
TT: Do you have advice for budding 
musicians, people who just wantto play?
AC: You have to keep in mind that 
music is a discipline and an art; without 
the discipline, you don’t have the art. 
You should always love the discipline 
part and the commitment part, because 
without it, it’s hard to even play poorly. 
It’s a form of expression that few people 
have the opportunity to pursue, espe­
cially at a high level.

HOME, from page LI
ize with in China over winter 
break. Chang went to her native 
town of Pingyao 
ShanXi for the first 
time in five-and-a- 
half years to visit her 
sick grandfather.
“People are very hos­
pitable — almost too 
nice,” she said. “They 
invite you to their 
houses for dinner, 
and when you say no, 
they drag you there.”
In the villages, un­
expected guests are al­
most expected. When 
Chang went to her old­
est uncle’s house, for 
example, the family 
had to prepare extra 
food. “They didn’t even 
know we were in 
China,” she said.
“Especially in the vil­
lages, people can walk 
into other people’s 
homes and start chat­
ting,” she said. “People 
clean up their houses 
because unexpected 
guests might show up 
at anytime.. .. They fold 
the blankets so they 
look nice and neat. If 
[the guest is] male, 
they usually give cigarettes, but 
for people in general they give ... 
dates immersed in wine.”
Chang said that the town was 
more technologically advanced 
than when she had left, with the 
addition of VCD machines — 
similar to Karaoke — and color 
TV. But at the same time the 
town continues to have a water 
problem. Water is released in 
the villages once a day, between
noon and 12:30. Families must 
stock up between these times, 
filling large pails.
Cathy Chang spent winter break in China visiting family and 
friends for the first time in five-and-a-half years.
“Many families have facilities 
for bathing, but they can’t use 
them,” said Chang. “They have to 
use public ones.”
When asked what she missed 
most about America when she was 
in China, Chang didn’t hesitate. 
“Water,” she said, and laughed. 
But, she added, there were also 
things to miss about China.
“Stars are clearly seen in the 
sky. Back in China in the village
there were no lights, so it gives 
you a peaceful feeling, I guess,” 
said Chang. “It’s not like the city 
where skies are 
almost red- 
purple in the 
nights, reflect­
ing all the lights 
of the city.”
For students 
like Chang, the 
break provided 
an opportunity 
to return to the 
lands of their 
familial roots 
and discover 
how they re­
lated to these 
places now that 
they’ve spent 
some time away 
from them.
“Before my 
trip, I was think­
ing, ‘I’m going 
home.’But when 
I got there, many 
things had 
changed,” said 
Chang. “Maybe 
it’s because they 
have stayed the 
same, but I have 
changed so much 
living in a differ­
ent country.”

“Rather than the more traditional 
things like gods, politicians, soup, beer, 
cars, sex appeal, or even shoes — I would 
like to sell us the art of communication,” 
said Tom Ripey, a local artist currently 
featured at the UC Art Galleiy.
His presentation, containing sculp­
tures and paintings, is titled “Purity 
Sells” and is meant to be both enter­
taining and accessible to what he calls 
the “traditional victims” (the public) of 
the advertising community. It is a col­
lection of a dated billboard ad cam­
paign for a fictitious shoe company.
“This group of work is intended as a 
socio-political metaphor.... The whole 
‘Purity Sells’ thing is ironic because 
purity doesn’t sell 
shoes because £t 
shoes aren’t pure,” 
said Ripey.
His choice of shoes 
is also related to 
Andy Warhol and his 
career as a graphic 
artist. During this 
time, Warhol some­
times portrayed shoes as popular cul­
ture icons. Ripey found it interesting 
that a steel town like Pittsburgh could 
produce an artist like Warhol.
“I tried to produce something that 
people could relate to, or at least I 
could relate to,” said Ripey, “My hope 
is that it will communicate three or 
four basic concepts very directly and 
that with some small effort on the 
viewer’s part, many other optional in­
terpretations will surface.”
“I found [Ripey’s] work funny in con­
tent, concept, and illustration,” said 
Seldon Yuan, a senior BHA major. 
“The message and concept was very 
clear and uncluttered. It matched the 
intent of the painter.”
One of Ripey’s goals was to show 
people that one can make art that is 
capable of transcending all social 
boundaries. “I don’t intend to condemn
advertising. In fact, I see all art as 
advertising, and what I want to sell is 
art, art as a means of communica­
tion,” said Ripey.
Ripey was glad to show his art at 
CMU because of the reputation of the 
College of Fine Arts, but at the same 
time felt that his particular style of 
work is different from what is taught 
in academia. He feels that his work is 
almost the antithesis to the forms of 
art taught at CMU.
“CMU’s fine arts program is push­
ing media and technological bound­
aries, while my art is primitive and 
simplistic,” he said. “My work is more 
colorful than what a student may be 
used to — almost eye-candy.”
He hopes that his work shows stu­
dents that art is made to communi-
cate and that this communication is 
important. “So if something is color­
ful, people will stop and get a chance 
to get the message,” said Ripey.
He also believes that art should be 
made more accessible for everyone 
and that bringing his art to CMU is 
helping to accomplish that.
“Basically, I hope that [people] en­
joy [the art],” said Ripey. “If there is a 
message in my art — if it has anything 
to teach to an art student — it is that 
they should have fun.”
The UC Art Gallery is located left of 
the entry to the University Center from 
the Emerson Courtyard. Ripey’s exhibit 
will beondisplay until January 31. The 
next feature, “One Woman’s Search for 
Humanity” — an exhibition about 
Black History Month by Lily Chang — 
will start February 2.
My work is more colorful than 
what a student may be used to 
— almost eye-candy.”

Conference helps students ‘fly’
Students go home to foreign landsVisitor finds fun, debt in Africa
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
“The only place where success comes 
before work is in the dictionary,” said Dr. 
Eric Grotzinger, associate dean of the 
Mellon College of Science, who was one of 
the speakers at Carnegie Mellon’s sixth 
annual Winter Conference last Sunday.
Coming from the phrase “to 
with flying colors,” this 
year’s Conference theme 
“Flying Colors” reflected 
the program’s aim of help­
ing students gain the nec­
essary skills to reach their 
highest goals. Through­
out the half-day confer­
ence, approximately 325 
student participants de­
veloped their skills to­
ward academic and per­
sonal success by interact­
ing with their peers, fac­
ulty, and administrators 
in four sessions of their 
own interest.
According to Andrew 
Snyder, a junior computer 
science major and the 
coordinator’s assistant for 
first-year programs, the 
Conference was initially designed for first- 
year students as a continuation of fall 
orientation, but this year the content of 
the program was refocused and the tar­
get audience widened.
“This year’s schedule takes into ac­
count students at all levels of develop­
ment and learning. Even seniors and 
juniors will find programs applicable to 
their experiences,” said Lisa Dingman, 
coordinator of Student Life for first-year 
programs and orientation.
The program began with keynote 
speaker Dr. Joel Greenhouse, associate 
dean of the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences (H&SS), who addressed 
the conference participants with the 
topic, “Things I’ve Learned Since Kin­
dergarten.” Through personal anecdotes 
and formal observations of university 
teaching and learning, Greenhouse
stressed the importance of communica­
tion and the personal responsibility for 
one’s learning.
According to Snyder, the Conference 
offers an attempt for students at the 
beginning of the second semester to look 
back at the fall semester and realize 
areas upon which they can improve. 
Twelve different workshops covering 
topics from studying abroad and learn-

“Get Out of Town!” at Sunday’s Winter Conference.
ing a second language to managing time 
and attracting employers were offered 
to the participants.
“We have also balanced the program 
so that if a student wants to focus in one 
area, such as academic skills, there are 
workshops available during each ses­
sion to address that topic,” said Dingman.
“The Competitive Edge,” presented 
by Evelyn Pierce, lecturer in business 
communications in the Graduate 
School of Industrial Administration 
(GSIA), was conducted in a workshop 
setting. Students shared stories of in­
stances where they have encountered 
competition at the individual level or 
within systems on campus. According 
to Pierce, one example is that some 
students on campus tend to talk about 
how one major is better than the other 
or how one school within CMU is bet-
ter than another, when actually they 
cannot be compared.
“[The session helped] students exam­
ine in what ways competition can hurt 
us, and in what ways it can be profitable 
and healthy,” said Pierce.
Many upperclassmen found several ses­
sions of interest, such as “Get Out of the 
Classroom,” in which a panel of employ­
ers presented what has been helpful to 
them as professionals and 
what attracts them as em­
ployers, based on personal 
experiences both as stu­
dents and as recruiters.
“They stressed to get in­
volved in what you are in­
terested in, even if it is not 
directly related to your 
major,” said Ann Bradley, 
a sophomore biology ma­
jor. ‘You always hear from 
other students and from 
professors that it is okay 
to not get a 4.0, but it was 
reassuring to hear it di­
rectly from employers.” 
According to Maria 
Muti, a junior psychology 
major, “Fellowships and 
Scholarships: Getting in 
the Loop” also offered good 
advice for upperclassmen, because it 
discussed ways to find funding in junior 
and senior years and for graduate school. 
This is the second year Muti partici­
pated in the Conference. “I really en­
joyed it last year and thought I could 
come again and again get something out 
of it,” she said.
Snyder said that the number of stu­
dent participants has steadily increased 
since the program began and it has been 
very successful overall.
“Programs like these are another ex­
ample of the University’s commitment 
to both academic excellence and creat­
ing an environment that is thriving in 
all areas of life,” said Bruce Lindsey, the 
associate head of the School of Architec­
ture and one of the presenters at this 
year’s Conference. “School is not just 
preparation for life, but life itself.”

to explain racism in America. I 
found that speaking with people 
from another culture is the best 
way to examine values on your 
own that may not always be ap­
parent when you are immersed 
in them. I doubt I learned any­
thing entirely new about myself 
or about America, but I con­
firmed some lingering suspi­
cions. There is a lot that the 
West can learn from African cul­
ture, most notably in the area of 
personal relations. Ghanaians 
have imported our T-shirts and 
our bottles of Coca-Cola; I hope 
we will copy their advances in 
generosity and kindness.
My return flight departed at 1 
am on January 1, 1998, Green­
wich Mean Time. Passengers in 
the departure terminal sponta­
neously counted down to mid­
night before singing a rousing 
rendition of Auld Lang Syne. 
Then I boarded the plane (firmly 
clutching my bag) and turned my 
watch back five hours to Eastern 
Standard Time. I nodded off but 
woke up in time to celebrate the 
new year again in mid-flight.
Incidentally, I encountered no 
one in Ghana who celebrates 
Kwanzaa. With the exception of 
Muslims, everyone celebrated 
Christmas and listened to winter- 
wonderland Christmas carols amid
85-degree temperatures and op­
pressive humidity. There is far less 
emphasis on the exchange of gifts, 
although a small Christmas tree 
was set up in the home I stayed in. 
So Christmas in Ghana was more 
like Thanksgiving, and Christmas 
Eve was more like New Year’s Eve, 
which is why, after running naked 
and free through the surf at mid­
night (I mean, really, when am I 
ever going to get the chance to do 
that again?), I slept on the sand 
until early the next morning.
I liked Ghana very much. (Me 
pe Ghana paa.) Anyone wishing 
to help me get out of debt can 
send cash or a check to me in 
care of The Tartan.

Remedies fix winter blues
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Staffwriter
Do you find yourself becoming more tired during the winter 
months? Does everything seem a little more1 bleak? Fear not, 
there are a lot of easy ways to spark up these long cold months 
if you are suffering from a case of the “winter blues.” One way to 
pass the time is by participating in a number of indoor and 
outdoor winter sports. (See related articles.) But there are other 
options to help relieve ¿the monotony of winter, and there are 
reasons why you, may feel pressure from this season.

Get out and get going
Outdoor sports relieve 
coldweather boredom
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
Around this time of year, it 
seems like everybody spends their 
time avoiding the cold. Pittsburgh 
is famous for those 33-degrees- 
and-raining weather reports. So 
we stay inside, depriving our­
selves of sunlight and falling vic­
tim to cabin fever. Ho hum.
Believe it or not, even in 
this kind of weather, 
there are ways to 
relieve winter 
boredom. 
Within
manageable distances, there are 
a variety of accessible activities 
that students can take advan­
tage of. And guaranteed, the air 
is fresher outside.
In Schenley Park, the Pitts­
burgh Department of Parks and 
Recreation runs an ice skating 
rink, which is one common win­
ter pastime among students. The 
rink sponsors college sessions on 
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sun­
day, with discounted ticket prices.
Sophomore J oanna Peters, who 
went ice skating several times 
last semester, said that the rink 
provides a diversion from the typi­
cal activities on campus during 
the winter.
“[Ice skating] is really relax­
ing,” said Peters, an ethics, his­
tory, and public policy major.
“Just to get out and get exer­
cise. It’s not sitting around 
watching TV or going over to 
McConomy every weekend.
There doesn’t seem to be 
much to do outside on 
campus. And when I
usually see all my friends, we’re 
just hanging out in the dorms.” 
Besides getting exercise, ice 
skating is a social function, where 
friends can congregate, even if 
skating itself isn’t their strong 
suit. Eric Van, rink manager, said 
that the basics of ice skating 
can be learned without 
too much diffi­
culty.
“You’ve got to be willing to fall 
down,” said Van. “And there’s a 
social stigma to falling, but if you 
can get over that, you can have 
great fun. I’ve seen college age 
kids pick it up rather quickly.” 
Van said that at any college ses­
sion, there are around 35-65 col­
lege students attending.
But one of the most popular 
ways to shed a winter funk is to 
leave campus altogether. The 
Campus Ski Connection sponsors 
trips to Seven Springs ski resort 
(under one-and-a-half hours
discount rentals, lift 
tickets, and trans­
portation. The 
trips run as

So you’ve realized that all the 
50-some odd channels have to 
offer is Anthony Robbins and his 
hypnotizing teeth. Fortunately, 
several clever people have 
planned for this societal break­
down by building glorious houses 
of fun for your frolicking plea­
sure, full of various sports to ease 
you troubled souls. The best part: 
their houses are better than your
house.
The Climbing 
Wall, Inc, located at 
7501 Penn Avenue, offers the next 
best thing when the real rocks rope climb- 
are either too far away or under ing, and lead

ing, and they

have this type in 
abundance. Top 
rope climbing involves being 
strapped to a rope, which 
goes to the top of the wall 
and back down, so someone 
at the bottom can control 
your slack and prevent you 
from falling on your head. 
Lead rope climbing is a little 
tougher. The climber has to 
fasten their own rope to vari­
ous points on the wall as they 
go along.
But don’t worry, The 
Climbing Wall Inc. caters to 
all skill levels. They offer an 
introductory class for begin­
ners at a cost of $15 which, 
as Manager Brian Janasziek 
said, “teaches you how not to 
kill yourself.” The cost of a 
day on the wall for students 
is $8 or $6 if you’re in the 
Explorers Club. Member­
ships to the Climbing Wall 
Inc. are available at a rea­
sonable cost. It’s a great way 
to practice your climbing 
skills, or just try your hand 
at the sport and blow off 
some stress.
Speaking of blowing off 
stress, or maybe blowing 
away stress, Laser Storm, 
located at 7715 McKnight 
Road gives players the

A really simple, and of­
ten overlooked, way to add 
some needed energy, is a 
change in diet. “Over the 
winter, I began to eat more, 
andbecause ofthe weather 
conditions I exercised less,” 
said Erin Medlin, a fresh­
man economics and infor­
mation decision systems 
major. She is not alone. 
Many people become more 
lethargic in the winter, and (because winter clothing tends not 
to be form fitting,) winter is the most likely time that extra 
pounds can sneak up on us. Eating less red meat, and more 
vegetables and grains, as well as high protein/low fat foods like 
chicken and fish, is a healthful way to get rid of those extra 
pounds and gain more energy.
There are also some foods whose mere presence makes the 
winter season more festive. They are fairly easy to make, as 
many students have found that a little radiation goes a long way. 
“Hot apple juice is very seasonal,” said Susan Demyar, a fresh­
man in the Carnegie Institute of Technology. “And very easy to 
make. All you do is put apple juice in the microwave for a few 
minutes, or until it steams.” Using a microwave is also an easy 
way to make that seasonal campfire favorite — S’mores. “Just 
take a piece of chocolate, put it on a graham cracker, put a 
marshmallow on top, and stick it in the microwave. In about 30 
seconds, it’s ready to go,” said Anika Amin, a sophomore infor­
mation decision systems major.

The local video store can also be a good source of entertainment 
during the wait for spring. It’s cheaper than going out to the 
movies, there is a larger selection than going out to the movies, 
and most importantly, there is no need to actually go out to the 
movies, you can watch in the comfort of your own home.
Sometimes an exciting action movie can liven up the winter. 
Two ofl&st summer’s blockbuster’s Face/Off and Men in Black 
are currently out on video. These films are not the typical macho 
action movies, but are instead surprisingly appealing to women, 
as they both feature not only mind-blowing special effects and 
explosions but also fast comedic dialogue and attractive 
leading men.
A good Brat Pack movie can also be fun. Of course, the classic 
Brat Pack movie is The Breakfast Club, a film about what 
happens when different types of teenagers are forced into friend­
ship. It is both humorous and endearing; one of those rare movies 
that’s still great whether it’s the first time or the hundred and 
first time it’s seen. Another excellent Brat Pack film is St. Elmo’s 
Fire, which some consider to be the sequel to The Breakfast Club. 
It follows a group of young adults as they try to make their way 
in the “real world.”
Surprisingly enough, the catharsis that comes from a good 
tearjerker can also be revitalizing. Stella and Beaches, both 
staring Bette Midler, bring tears to our eyes by dissecting the 
relationships between mothers and daughters, and lifelong 
girlfriends, respectively.
Most people find that a 
change of diet or an enter­
taining movie is an effec­
tive way to ward off the 
winter “blahs.” However, 
some people try anything 
and everything to escape 
the bleakness of winter
win- 
to a
detachment from social 
activities, an inexplicable 
craving for sugar and car­
bohydrates, and overwhelming drowsiness. Fear not, if you 
suffer from any or all of these symptoms you may be one of the 
many Americans that suffers from Seasonal Affective Disorder 
(SAD). But, luckily, there is a cure.
SAD seems to be the result of shorter days during the winter. 
Light has a biological effect on brain hormones and function. 
Therefore, it could be a disturbance in the “biological clock” in the

Conductor orchestrates soloists’ performances
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Contributing Editor
“The definition of a concerto is: a work 
that is used as a vehicle to show off a 
soloist or soloists,” conductor/violinist 
Andres Cardenes said from the Heinz 
Hall stage Saturday evening. With the 
performance of Bach’s Six Brandenburg 
Concertos, the Pittsburgh Symphony Or­
chestra did not need to show off.
They played the first movement of the 
Concerto No. 1 in FMajor with a delight­
ful juxtaposition of instruments. There 
; were horns blaring, winds blowing, and 
strings singing. The only thing that told 
my amateur ear that this was Bach and 
not Brahms or Beethoven was the 
harpsichord, constantly plucking away 
in the background.
. . It was the sort of performance you feel 
like clapping for and, as they paused, I 
separated my hands to applaud. But 
nobody else in the audience saw the 
need for applause, so I kept my hands 
.quiet, and it seemed an awkward thingOff-campus games 
remedy winter woes
to have to keep silent when I wanted to 
show my appreciation for something. 
The orchestra didn’t seem to mind 
though, as they quickly progressed to 
the second movement.
This was a weepy sort of movement. 
There was more for the bassoon and the 
oboe this time, and soon the 
latter was playing a solo 
with Cardenes on violin. It 
seemed odd to me that the 
conductor, Cardenes, would 
be playing so many solos, 
but he was enthusiastic and 
very good. Cardenes is a 
short, well-proportioned 
man with pepper-colored and well- 
gelled hair who may well have been 
born with a violin in his hand. [Ed. note: 
please see related story, L2]
After this slow movement finished, 
Cardenes led the orchestra in a lively 
Allegro. This movement seemed de­
signed to show off the violin, and 
Cardenes was doing much more playing 
than conducting, which isn’t a complaint.
It hardly seemed possible for a violin to 
be played that quickly without it sound­
ing like a fiddle, but Bach and Cardenes 
pulled it off.
When the PSO launched into a fourth 
movement without applause, I figured 
that this was one of those “no clapping”
It hardly seemed possible for a violin 
to be played that quickly without it 
sounding like a fiddle, but Bach and 
Cardenes pulled it off.
concerts. While in the first three move­
ments the instruments complimented 
each other, this one was about contrast. 
Cardenes directed the oboes and bas­
soons through the soft opening, motion­
ing as if he were petting a large cat. Next 
the strings seemed to separate, with 
Cardenes instructing the violins to play 
to a greater perfection than I could judge 
and the violas, harpsichord, and bass
answering. Lastly, the horns had their 
turn and the oboes came back, which 
gave the movement a sort of closure. 
Here, the conductor motioned more hesi­
tantly and with greater precision, like 
he was pulling out porcupine quills.
Finally there was applause, which 
Cardenes allowed to be 
allotted to each of the sec­
tions. The oboes were 
cheered the loudest, 
which seemed fitting. The 
rest of the concertos were 
played out of order. Con- 
certo No. 6 in B-flat Ma­
jor featured the two vio­
las, accompanied by three cellos, bass, 
and as always, harpsichord. The lead 
viola played a fantastically fast theme 
which was echoed by the second.
This small ensemble played the most 
exciting music and would have seemed 
a fitting finale. The program revealed 
that Bach himself would have played the 
first viola.
Concertos No. 4inG Major, No. 2inF
Major, and No. 3 in G Major highlighted 
flute, trumpet, and violin respectively, 
but it was the last concerto, No. 5 in D 
Major — that was most remarkable.
The first movement of No. 5 contains a 
65-bar harpsichord solo with no accompa­
niment. In his youth, Kipnis said he was 
once challenged to play a rare, 17-bar solo 
that Bach once wrote that is atypical to the 
composer’s style. But Kipnis has found 
that the beginning and ends of the shorter 
solo coincides with sections in the longer 
one. After this revelation, Kipnis started 
playing the shorter solo encapsulated in 
the longer one.
“I’ve been accused by people who didn’t 
know what I was doing of making it up 
on the spot,” said Kipnis. “[But] Bach 
was a bit of a wildman. After all, think of 
the number of children that he had.”
Much like Bach, the PSO showed that 
their talents are complex. From their large 
ensemble pieces, with complimenting 
performances, to their superb solos, the 
orchestra showed that it can strut its stuff 
with Six Brandenburg Concertos.

For those who may want to 
go slightly more hardcore, 
there’s Urban Assault, an in­
door paintball facility, located 
at 447 Washington Avenue 
in Bridgeville.
The complex covers 
30,000 square feet, with 
catwalks, buildings, 
and barricades to 
make things interest­
ing. Paintball, espe­
cially indoors, can hurt 
a little more than other 
activities, but the pay­
off is often worth it.
Some of the fraterni­
ties often sponsor trips 
to the paintball arena 
during Rush. According 
to James Scull, a junior 
electrical and computer 
engineering major, this 
is a great way to 
meet people.
“You connect with the 
players on your team. 
And the other team,” he 
said.
And what better way to 
meet people than by crawl­
ing around like an Army 
guy, the way you did when 
you were a kid. “You can 
almost hear the Rambo 
theme in the background.” 
Sessions of paintball last 
four hours, and costs range 
between $12 and $50, de­
pending on how much extra 
gear you want to use, plus 
about $15 for paint. The ses­
sion fee includes safety 
gear and instruction so 
pain can be kept at a 
minimum. Unless, of

Lee Rider, coordinator of the trips and 
a junior business administration major, 
said that the biggest trip last year took 
250 students to Seven Springs. Skiing 
at a large-scale resort such as Seven 
Springs is a viable option for a lot of 
students.
“For most students who don’t have 
cars it’s kind of hard to get around,” said 
Rider. “From my experience, you don’t 
really feel like driving back after a long 
night of skiing, and the fact that trans­
portation is provided is a benefit.”
Nalini Garg, a sophomore business 
administration major, planned a skiing 
trip with several friends for this past 
weekend. She was enthusiastic, despite 
never having skied before. Garg said 
that the trip provided a welcome diver­
sion after classes, and a chance to spend 
time with friends before classwork built 
up too much.
“It is going to be my first time [skiing], 
so I don’t know how it will go,” said

CRITICAL EYE
______________by Alex Lewin
1997 had its share of really bad 
movies: Starship Troopers, Devil’s 
Advocate and Alien Resurrection. 
Then there were a handful of over­
rated movies: The Ice Storm, 
Amistad, and As Good as It Gets. 
Then there were movies that I 
wanted to like but just couldn’t: 
The Game, Kundun, and Titanic. 
But out of the big mess that was 
’97, a handful of flicks stood out, 
including two very smart sci-fi 
films, the story of a college-age 
genius who doesn’t know how to 
make something of himself, and 
one of the best comedies of the 
last ten years.
10. Gattaca Like a few of the 
movies on this list, Gattaca runs 
into problems near the end. But 
before it becomes a little too corn- 
ball, it’s a surprisingly smart and 
visually sleek film that never
fawns over the details of the fu­
turistic world it creates the way a 
lot of science fiction movies do. 
Jude Law gives one of the year’s 
best performances.
9. Donnie Brasco. While one 
must give credit to the cast 
and director Mike Newell, the 
strengths (and weaknesses) of 
this Mafia-goon-does-good story 
are really the result of screen­
writer Paul Attanasio (Quiz 
Show), who has proven himself 
to be one of the best in 
the business.
8. In the Company of Men. 
It’s a real pleasure to see a movie 
that convinces you that you’re 
actually watching real people. In 
fact, the power of this story, about 
a cruel sexual game played out in 
the corporate world, lies in that 
very realism — it’s frightening to 
think that something like this 
could actually happen, but writer- 
director Neil LaBute convinces 
us it could.
7. Cop Land. I was stunned to 
see Sylvester Stallone actually 
acting. And you know what? He’s 
not half-bad. In fact, the entire 
cast is excellent under the smart
and calculated direction of James 
Mangold, writer and director of 
my pick as the best film 
of 1996, Heavy.
6. Boogie Nights. Though it 
gets a little sloppy at the end, this 
film is otherwise an unpredict­
able and unrelenting look at the 
porn industry of the ’70s.

mances from Mark

and Burt Reynolds. Watch out 
for the last scene if you easily 
suffer from penis envy.
5. Contact. I admit it takes a 
little while to get into this movie, 
which starts out slow. But the 
pace picks up, and by the half­
way point, Contact grabs you and 
doesn’t let you go. The story ex­
amines the God-versus-science 
conflict in a fresh way, skillfully 
weaving it in as a subtext be­
neath the search for extra­
terrestrial life.
4. The Full Monty. What’s 
difficult about making a comedy 
is that you have to keep topping 
yourself. It is in this respect that 
films like Wag the Dog and As 
Good as It Gets ultimately fail — 
they run out of steam. But The 
Full Monty is always surprising 
and consistently funny, and even 
a little touching.
3. Good Will Hunting. This 
would be my number one choice 
were it not for one key scene 
between Matt Damon and Robin 
Williams that simply doesn’t 
work. Had it been written dif­
ferently, by otherwise tremen­
dously talented screenwriters 
Damon and Ben Affleck, Good 
Will'Hunting might have been a 
perfect movie.
2. Night Falls on Manhat­
tan. Nobody remembers it, and 
those who do don’t like it. But 
in this story of a young district 
attorney exposing police cor­
ruption, every scene is a story 
unto itself. Writer-director 
Sidney Lumet (Dog Day After­
noon, Network) is truly at the 
top of his form.
1. LA Confidential I hate to 
jump on the bandwagon {LA. 
Confidential has been almost ev­
ery critic’s number one pick), but 
this movie is possibly the best 
film noir since Chinatown. And it 
isn’t just a rehash of noir ele­
ments. Rather, it makes a strong 
statement about the history 
of Los Angeles while reminding 
us just how thrilling a good 
thriller can be.

Before I saw Kundun, I was 
told that “it was like watching 
paint dry.” When the film was 
over, I was inclined to agree. 
Kundun is slow, too slow. “Bor­
ing” doesn’t really fit because 
the movie shows us a world and 
a person (the 14th Dalai Lama) 
we know nothing about, and 
that’s all very interesting. Nev­
ertheless, it takes a lot of energy 
to stick with this film.
i
What: Kundun 
Director: Martin Scorsese 
Company: Touchstone
For example, in one key scene a 
group of monks sets many obj ects 
on a table, some of which be­
longed to the 13th Dalai Lama. 
They ask a boy, who they suspect 
is the reincarnation of the Dalai 
Lama, to identify which ones be­
longed to him in his previous life. 
It’s a fascinating scene — the boy 
identifies his possessions, and the 
holy men understand quickly that 
they have found Kundun, the 14th 
Dalai Lama. But the scene keeps 
going. The kid keeps picking stuff 
out, the monks keep bowing their 
heads, and we get the point long 
before the scene ends.
I felt bad about not liking 
Kundun, as though I were vio­
lating some code of political cor­
rectness, or I was wrong to dis­

Kinetic exhibit provokes thought
By SUSAN MURRAY
Tartan Staffwriter
The first sculpture that caught one’s eye in 
the Hewlett Gallery was Paysage. A tiny 
golden circle of light traced its way across a 
hatch-marked landscape on a tiny white 
card. When I least expected it, the dot moved 
off of the card and onto the gallery wall. The 
sort of surprise and transformation present 
in this piece are important elements in “Fic­
tion,” Myron Helfgott’s new show. It fea­
tures kinetic sculptures, projections, and 
relief works.
“Every few years I’m forced into drawing 
because of space restraints,” Helfgott said. 
His drawings have a hard time competing 
for attention with the buzzing and wiring 
kinetic sculptures, which have been his pri­
mary work in the past few years, but they 
still merit equal examination. By using a 
pentagraph, a sort of extending arm that can
enlarge or shrink drawings, he creates a 
series of overlapping, distorted images.
Not only does Helfgott build fascinating 
sculptures, he also deals with complex 
ideas. Frequently, in kinetic mixed me­
dium sculptures, the artist tends to be­
come so caught up in the technical “wow” of 
new devices, such as tiny video cameras, 
that the art becomes more an amusement 
park attraction than a stimulating object 
urging the viewer to think. Helfgott has 
avoided this trap by creating objects that 
use some of the newest technologies both 
to fascinate the viewer and to speak to him 
on a higher level.
One of the most exciting pieces is Restless 
Passage. This sculpture consists of an enor­
mous arc constructed of scenic photographs 
and a mechanical compass. When the arc of 
photographs ends, the compass extends the 
arc with a thick black line it draws on the 
gallery wall. The machine holds a photo­
graph as if poised to place it next in line. 
Further examination reveals that there is a 
tiny camera near the next photograph. The 
camera captures people moving around in 
the gallery. In this way the arc becomes 
infinite. It not only encompasses an entire 
horizon but also everything that will ent^r 
that horizon as time passes.
Helfgott remarked that he was greatly in­
fluenced by the work of Duchamp, an artist 
who frequently sought to examine how gen­
der transformation can be used in art. Rest­
less, one of Helfgott’s stronger works, is.a 
wooden head on a turntable simultaneously 
wrapped with projections of human facqs 
from two cameras. As the head moves, it 
oscillates between distorted female and ma|e 
features, and finally, a perfectly “normal” 
face emerges. J
“Fiction” will be at the Hewlett through 
January 31.

We therefore advocate a revolution against the

make use of violence, it may be sudden, or it may be 
a relatively gradual process spanning a few de­
cades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do 
outline in a very general way the measures that 
those who hate the industrial system should take in 
order to prepare the way for a revolution against 
that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL

admiration for Martin Scorsese 
that many critics and students 
do. Certainly the man has a con­
trol over the medium that only .a

he consistently goes over the top 
— there’s too much violence or 
too much blood or so many hor­

In its own way,Kundun goes too 
far as well. It’s not a violent or 
gruesome movie, but it does get so 
wrapped up in its own story that it 
seems to forget its audience.
Kundun follows the 14th Dalai

early manhood, until he is fi­

loving country.
The Chinese are portrayed as

Purity Sells is an exhibition of imagery

by acclaimed Virginian artist Myron 
Helfgott, is on display at the Hewlett Gal­

surfaces. Each sculpture gives viewers in­
sights into their points of perspective and 
ways of perceiving. The projections often 
add an identity to the sculptures, breath­
ing life into their inanimate structures. Ad­
mission is free. For more information, con­

Editorial Reflections
We have to admit that there was some trepida­
tion on our part, when we chose “Reflections” for this 
issue’s theme. We were worried that our andrew 
accounts would be flooded with really overly-emotion- 
al poems about lost loves or childhood playgrounds, 
but we were pleasantly proven wrong.
Many fine submissions graced our accounts, 
and in the end we feel this issue of Dossier might hold 
the best work so far.
The reason why we chose “Reflections” was 
because November brings thoughts of politics, and 
elections, family, and food. Once we realized that, we 
thought it only natural to make this issue’s theme 
“Reflections.”
From Yavorsky’s nostalgic reflections on cam­
pus construction, to Spear’s soothing reflections on the 
night landscape, the work manages to cover a wide 
range of subjects and emotions. We hope you find it as 
enjoyable to read as we did.
Happy Holidays. You, our readers and submit­
ters, made this first semester a great success! See you in 
January!

OUR LATEST CYCLING CORSET.
We hare produced this new and beautiful model with special reference to tbowunteof lady cyclists. Whilo enjoying the freedom of this exhilirating ex­orcise the regular corBet will be found too severe, and consequently wearisome.A shorter garment, allowing more opportunity for chest expansion and freedom of motion to arms and shoulders, is a necessity, and all will appreciate the 
ready adaptation of this spccial design of corset to this need.It iB so constructed that the top line will fall just below the busts, and being short over the hips will not Interfere with easy propulsion of the wheel.Do not make the mistake of supposing the garment short waiated because it looks short. It iB simply shortened at top and bottom to allow of a greater freedom of motion. Long, graceful waist effects are produced, the same as by the regular corset.It iB made of strongest English coutils, in White, Drab and Black, and is WARRANTED In every particular to meet the requirements of the most exacting.Price, 924.00 per dozen.

i felt some sort of weird identity with that, probably like the way the hippies felt with their generation, a genera­
tion identity that we of this day and age just lack, it was nice experiencing that feeling, but the novelty faded fast.
class of 1999, you're right there with us.
the generation who never saw the campus as a campus, the ones who never saw the campus like it was in all those 
glossy folders they sent us. the ones who could never walk across the cut barefoot with full peace of mind (not that that 
stopped anybody).
love it anyway, christina taught us oc's well.
but there was one day... they took down all the construction fences for a photo shoot.
[oh, the irony]
i was walking down forbes and i noticed something.
nothing, nothing clogging up the middle of campus, that made my goddamn day, let me tell you. it was beauti­
ful. i wanted to take a picture, but i convinced myself that the condition the campus was in at the time was permanent.
that was mistake number one. fences up within 24 hours.
all summer's in a day? hope you weren't locked in closet.
i know that all this is 'investment for the future' and all that jazz that would be used as justification for anything 
your parents would make you do that you would rather not... it just caught my eye.

CHAINMAIL
by Richard Alan Yavorsky
for the time that i've spent here, i've come across many interesting faces; many being writers, they would always tell me about 
how sometimes you would get this itching to write and have to write at that moment before you would lose the effect.
i now appreciate that, anyhoo...
as i walked back to my humble casa in doherty apartments from hunt library, i was feeling pretty good for whatever reason, i 
just got done with a big assignment, an assignment where my partner showed up 2 hours late, i didn’t even care about that petty detail, 
little homework, nice night, things are good, it was just one of them content feelings, you know? words lack the justification... so i'm 
not going to try too hard.
then i saw this little yellow sign in the distance.
'keep out.'
and then i saw what they were attached to.
fences, and not the 'long standing tradition of emu' variety, either.
even though they might as well be.
trees were down, dirt everywhere, i walked up to that fence and realized that the last time i walked up the morewood side­
walk to doherty was
my last.
you could still see the chalking that spirit of skibo did that past weekend for the football game amidst the rubble, it hasn't 
rained since that weekend, bunch of crazy undergrads running around at midnight cutting open their knuckles writing on sidewalks 
with chalk pieces that were too small to use. •
all surrounded by a chain-link fence. H>-
the pipe and drum corps were practicing as i was there... i could hear them in the distance, i heard the distinctive whine of 
them playing taps.
even though they weren't playing taps.
the construction people built a little sidewalk around their stuff so we would have something to walk on.
how convenient.
and there i stood, member of the class of 1998.

To tell of experience in my defense 
So I get the benefits and perks and dollars

Night Listening 
by Amanda Spear
I sit at the crumb scattered table, cradling my steaming white mug, late night stillness rushing 
through my head. I wonder if it is as quiet in the convenience store on the corner or if the flow 
of gum, cigarettes and money is constant. Two mice rustle in the wall, getting ready to bed 
down in cigar boxes lined with fuzz. I want to lie compactly in a soft bed, nuzzle up to a warm 
body and curl a tail to my back. Instead I am sitting in the kitchen at four am, smoking, 
drinking chamomile tea and rubbing burning eyes, listening to night noises. 
Plink...plonk...plink—the faucet dripping against dirty pots piled high, hollow counterpoint to 
the s-w-i-s-h of radiators, punctuated by an occasional clang from deep in the furnace's 
throat. Sirens sound their call, made mournful by distance and I hear, faintly, the yawn of a 
nightshift worker as she starts her car. Noises in my head clamor louder, they are what woke 
me , kept me stiff limbed, popped my lids open, knotted my hair. I hear noises of others unable 
to lie quietly. This unease is as quiet as the 
flipping
of pages or the 
tapping
of nails. It can be loud, exhibitionist, causing us to stomp our feet and sway restlessly, stare 
blankly and kiss strangers. Soon alarms will ring, cars will rumble, register will clang, the 
day will start, allowing us to forget our night noises. I became a night listener in hopes of 
finding a sound larger than me, a sound to wrap me in tendrils tender and fierce, a sound that 
will rock me and slap me until the other noises fade, softer, further away, until they just waft 
up into the sky, join the cawing crows.

The wind flew in ballots,
Trenching wildflowers 
It Itself engendered,
Basqulng and clasping 
The dregs of fatigue 
To simply wander 
A petal further from stem.
The shining sun 
Is not so brilliant 
If the mind is peaceful,
And only sees pleasant Images.
On an outrage of rock,
Bathed in yellow segments 
Of flower and scent,
The glare of sun 
Injures only quietly,
Only like a far away vision 
In the sea,
Beside the boat's limb.
Tranquilly, the soul 
Smooths and spreads itself 
Over what the eyes 
see.
it quivers gently 
That everything is so perfect,
So without appeal.
Thre is nothing to ask for.
Only that this will not last a little time.
Not forever,
But for a little time.
It's been a long time 
Since Roberto was alive.
His long, frayed hair,
And coarse, swarthy skin,
His pitch-black frown,
Which swayed 
The hearts
I could never capture.
When he left,
A haze of suffocated ideals,
And emulation 
Swarmed over the town.
Within the greyed bricks,
Which housed his limbs,
People saw 
The smile
Which was never his,
Which he never delivered.
And everyone believed his honor genuine. 
We thought he had died perfectly, 
Because any one of us 
Would have died just like him,
If we could have 
Mustered the agony.
Some said even the atheists 
Divined a god 
In order to comprehend 
His will.
I knew Roberto.
I had known him 
All my life.
He died for the country, yes,
But he never 
Meant to stay dead.
He wanted to see us 
Without him,
To cherish 
His power unflalled 
It was not his honour,
But our dishonor,
He starved for.
If he smiled,
Another's weakness 
Purported it.
That's how 
He always was.
As I said,
Roberto's been dead 
A long time.
But his
Power was felt 
By everyone, 
except him.
