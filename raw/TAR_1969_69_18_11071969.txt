African Ambassador Speaks
by Pamela Horner
His Excellency Davidson Nicol. 
permanent representative of Sier­
ra Leone to the UN. and one of the 
guest speakers for the African 
Symposium, spoke at 11:30 a.m. 
on Tuesday about "Black Ameri­
cans Contributions to Africa in the 
19th Century." His Excellency was 
educated at Cambridge and has 
degrees in several fields, includ­
ing medicine, science, and law. 
In the past he was president of 
the University of Sierra Leone, a 
fellow of Christ College, and help­
ed in the original research which 
led to the development of penicil­
lin. He is also a writer of poetry 
and fiction. Incidentally, the first 
two science teachers His Excllen- 
cy studied under were graduates 
of CIT.
Dr. Nicol started by giving 
some background information 
about the two African countries 
with close ties to America. Sierra
Leone and Liberia, neighboring 
countries on the west coast of Af­
rica. were intimately related to 
the back-to-Africa movement that 
gained momentum in America 
during the 19th century.
Sierra Leone's first settlement 
was made by black men from 
America who had fought on the 
losing side in the Revolutionary 
War and then followed the British 
soldiers to Nova Scotia. Failing 
to receive the land that they had 
been promised, they set sail for 
Africa. Through the years they 
were followed by freedom and 
runaways. Sierra Leone was a 
colony under the British Empire, 
became a full-fledged member of 
the British Commonwealth, and 
has now. for 80 years had self- 
governing freedom under a dem­
ocratic two-party system.
Liberia was established with 
the help of the American govern­
ment and Sierra Leone. In 1847.
the settlement announced itself 
free, but had to wait for official 
U.S. recognition until the Civil 
War since the Southerners refused 
to acknowledge Negro diplomats.
For manv vears Liberia and Ethi-/opia were the only independent 
African countries.
Dr. Nicol then traced the be­
ginning of a back-to-Africa move­
ment in the United States. "The 
19th century unhopefully for most 
black Americans. There was the 
inevitable dissillusionment after 
the crushing of the hope that had 
been stirred by the Civil War and 
its ideology.'- The worsening sit­
uation was reflected in the minds 
of the free and the intelligent Ne­
groes. and because a percentage 
had some memory of Africa (even 
though they did not know directly 
about hen they began to look in 
her direction for a possible an­

Election Law Violation?
New Injunction Secured
The University obtained an injunction Oct. 29 against David Caney. 
David Schwartz and Frank Morra and participants in the demonstra­
tion in support of the Black Construction Coalition last month. The in­
junction now held differs in two respects from the one sought at the 
time of the demonstration.
First, the first injuction did not limit the site of future demonstra­
tions that could be interrupted by a sheriff's deputy to the construction 
site. In other words, under that injuction any future demonstration on 
campus could be handled by local enforcement agencies.
Second, the new injunction does not limit the number of people 
who may participate in future demonstrations. The previous injuction 
limited the participants to five.
The injunction now in the possession of the University states: that 
"in connection with the construction of buildings or other facilities on 
the campus of Carnegie-Mellon University, the detendents and those 
acting in concern with them, are restrained from:
"<11 Preventing or attempting to prevent by any species of 
threats, force, obstruction or turning aside against his will, any of the 
plaintiff's students, agents, employees, representatives, or any agents, 
employees, or representatives of independent contractors, or others 
having business with said plaintiff, from entering, leaving and trans­
acting business on plaintiff s property:
"<2> Demonstrating, other than peacefully, and from commiting 
any acts of force or violence.
In addition, the injunction ordered that participants in a picket 
must remain in single file and in motion at least ten feet apart.
The injunction is a double injunction, imposing restraints upon the 
construction workers as well as students. "Construction employees 
and all persons acting in concert with them shall be restrained and en­
joined from in any way physically harming or preventing any students, 
including student defendants and others acting in concert with them, 
from exercising their rights of tree assembly ."
Election Laws Violated 
Claims Jailed Student

At the polls in Donner Hall Tuesday. Gary Magil. 
a junior C-Ml student, was arrested for creating a 
disturbance. Here's what happened:
Gary was passing by the polling area at about 
10:45 a.m. when he and another student noticed that 
a third youth was standing outside distributing par­
tisan literature to the voters. The two students also 
noted that the other had in his possession a copy of 
the Regulations of the Board of Elections of Alle­
gheny County. They asked him about the many elec­
tioneering signs evident about the voting area, and 
if their distance from the actual booths was in com­
pliance with board rules. They also inquired if he 
were himself an appropriate distance from the polls 
and were told that he was.
The signs, however, did seem to be in violation 
of the rule that no electioneering may be conducted 
within a ten-foot radius of the booths and official 
voting area. When Magil went inside the area he 
found that although literature for various candi­
dates was distributed freely near the polls, there 
were no copies of the penalties for violations in evi­
dence. According to Election Board regualations. 
one copy of the violations and penalties must be 
posted in each booth, and at least three more copies 
must be available within the immediate vicinity of 
the booths.
Magil realized that a clear definition of the "poll­
ing area had not been drawn, -since the partition 
formerly used in Donner Hall for elections was now 
in use. A constable told Gary to call the Board of 
Elections if he felt an infraction the rules existed. 
The board, however, referred Gary to the Court of 
Common Pleas, which in turn declared that the 
Sheriff's Office woi^d have to send someone out to 
investigate. After unraveling several miles of red 
tape. Gary arrived back at Donner to talk to the
THREE STUDENTS were arrested Tues­
day night in Scobell Hall by City Nar­
cotics Agents possessing a warrant. At 
an arraignment Wednesday morning 
they were charged with violation of 
narcotics laws. A hearing has been 
scheduled for November 12 at which 
time it will be decided whether charg­
es will be dropped or the defendents 
will be held for court.
judge of elections. The judge, whose job it is to of­
ficiate at the polls all day long, began to discuss the 
problem calmly with Gary. However, communica­
tions soon deteriorated to the point of shouting, 
whereupon the judge ordered Gary off the premesis. 
As he began to comply. Magil was insulted by an­
other election worker. Compelled to reply, he turned 
back. The judge immediately declared that he had 
refused to leave upon request. The judge thus felt 
justified in calling the police to the scene.
"What's your beef?'' the officer asked Magil.
"Sir." replied Gary. "Are you familiar with the 
Election Laws of this district.
The man signed in the affirmative.
Magil then explained that he had reason to be­
lieve the rules to be in violation. »Voters began to 
take notice of the commotion. A crowd of students 
congregated.>
"Do you want to be arrested?"
If I can see a magistrate, yes."
"You are under arrest."
Gary was taken to Station House No. 5. booked 
on disorderly conduct, searched and celled. He had 
his books along, so he studied for a while. Then he 
began to pester the turn key to be allowed to phone 
the Court of Common Pleas. He said he was calling 
from jail, and they promised to call Dean Swank.
Meanwhile, however. Dean Kochman had arriv­
ed to bail Gary out and drive him back to campus. 
He went back to afternoon classes. Before leaving 
the Station House, however, he was informed that 
he must appear before night court that evening to 
answer the charges. Later Gary learned that no 
night court would be held that evening. His hearing 
was deferred until Wednesday morning.
The deferrment gave Dean Swank an opportun­
ity to investigate the case He talked to several wit­
nesses. attorneys, and the judge of elections at the 
Donner Hall Polls. The judge agreed to drop charges 
if Gary would promise not to make counter charges. 
He did. so that the judge would, and the case was 
subsequently dimissed Wednesday morning.
Gary commented that police brutality did not 
figure at all in his arrest. Except for the delay in 
getting to a phone at the police station, and.the fact 
that violation of the rules was never clarified, the 
whole procedure was handled fairly well.
Dean Swank said Tuesday evening that Donner 
Hall is not generally an ideal location for the holding 
of elections. Come May, he hopes to exert enough in­
fluence to move the polling place to Skibo. where 
living areas will not be disrupted, and where legal 
procedures can be more easily defined

Symposium Attcndflncc. Forbes Ave. Sail Boats Sell Unclean Needles
A Dismal Testimonial
We are appalled and embarrassed by the many members of 
this University who have not participated in the African Sym­
posium, “Cultures in Contact.”
Last week (Oct. 32) in an editorial we stated that “it would 
be a sad testimonial of the University’s concern with the society 
outside if a capacity crowd were not attracted to all the sched­
uled programs.” That testimonial, unfortunately, has been 
made.
Monday night, a student drama production’ “Black without 
Blackness,” was played to a capacity crowd in the Skibo ball­
room-composed almost entirely of blacks from the commun­
ity. Certainly, those who attended enjoyed and benefited from 
the show. Yet those who it should have reached—the students 
here—were not present.
Tuesday morning, during the 11:30 assembly hour when 
most classes are not scheduled, Dr. Davidson Nicol, Ambassa­
dor from Sierra Leone to the United Nations, spoke to a small 
audience in the Ballroom. His lecture concerning the “back-to- 
Africa” movement was brilliant, enlightening and well-present­
ed. No one who attended the speech could have failed to have 
gained from it.
What does this lack of participation indicate? First, it dem­
onstrates the phenomena that most people would prefer to act 
and respond on the basis of already formulated convictions ra­
ther than take the time to test their beliefs and increase their 
information.
Second, the small attendance reflects the hypocrisy of the 
many who claim that understanding the black/white crisis is 
one of their foremost priorities and responsibilities. It is easy to 
espouse support of positive social values. It is more difficult, 
it takes more time and effort, to come to an understanding of the 
problem.
It is sad and unfortunate that the intellectual community is 
committing the same crime that we “effet snobs” accuse others 
of committing—that of misinformed and uneducated opinions. 
Perhaps we are even more at fault than those in America who 
have not had the opportunity for higher education. For we have 
had that opportunity—and failed to take full advantage of it.
Saturday night, the last event of this week’s symposium, 
Olatunji’s “Drums of Passion Revue” will take place in the
gymnasium. From all reports, the performance should be one
of the most electrifying and exciting this campus has ever wit­
nessed. We strongly urge everyone to attend.

Editor, The Tartan:
I refer to the letter appearing 
in your issue of Oct. 28, 1969. and 
captioned “Blood Drive.”
The writer there asserts that 
the form provided by the Central 
Blood Bank of Pittsburgh, by ex­
ecution of which parents of min­
ors waive liability, requires too 
broad a waiver. He is specifically 
concerned that it requires the 
minor to bear the risk of injury 
arising from the use of an un­
clean needle.
In the first place, may I point 
out that the hcnces of encounter­
ing an unclean needle in the Cen­
tral Blood Bank’s program are 
about equal to the chances that the 
writer will be run down by a sail 
boat on Forbes Ave. This, how­
ever, does not respond to his ex­
pressed concern that the waiver 
is too broad.
I suggest that his concern is un­
founded. What the forms says, 
with the redundance which if of­
ten and unfortunately found in 
legal forms (it also includes a 
glaring typographical error) is 
that the signer waives “all 
claims, demands, suits, or liabil­
ity resulting in any manner from 
the donation of blood.”
It does not mention any liability 
resulting from the use of unclean 
needles or from any other negli­
gent act by which the minor might 
be injured.
Central Blood Bank does not 
believe itself protected against 
claims resulting from injuries 
caused by the negligence of its 
employees, as is witnessed by the 
fact that it carries extensive in­
surance to cover any such claims 
which might arise. As I indicated 
at the outset, the insurer has not 
been and is not likely to be called 
on to pay any such claims because
the Blood Bank is scrupulous to 
see that none is justified.
But should one arise, it is my 
opinion that the waiver form com­
plained of does not release the 
Blood Bank from the liability so 
incurred.

Dissatisfied with Skibo's Policy
Editor, The Tartan:
I feel it necessary to gripe about 
the fact that the Homecoming 
committee took over Skibo for tw 
consecutive nights. It is totally un­
fair that C-MU students be denied 
the right to enter their own stu­
dent union building, intended for 
the use of 100 per cent of the stu­
dent body, without paying $3 per 
night. For students not wishing to 
shell out several bucks, not only 
was their contribution from the 
Homecoming committee zero, ra­
ther it was negative because a 
“keep out sign” was placed be­
tween them and Skibo. As a stu­
dent in a $2,200 per year tuition 
university, I feel I am entitled to 
enter my own student union build- 
inithout paying a fee.
When the Homecoming commit-
tee boasted about operating with­
out help from the administration 
and attracting several hundred 
people, it neglected to mention 
that several hundred people with­
out Homecoming tickets who were 
prohibited the right to enter Ski­
bo to obtain a snack. Do you real­
ize that the nearest snack bar 
from campus is two-thirds of a 
mile away?
Because the Homecoming com­
mittee’s planning was not benefi­
cial to the entire student body, but 
beneficial to some and detrimen­
tal to others, it was a hit alright— 
right into a triple play which blew 
the ball game. I certainly hope 
that a similar situation does not 
reoccur at spring carnival.
Dissatisfied
Von Braun Carried No Bag Full Of Tricks
Editor, The Tartan:
It seems odd that the Tartan has 
deemed it necessary to move edi­
torial opinions from page two to 
page one. We are, of course, re­
ferring to Chuck Daly’s shallow 
analysis of Dr. Werner von 
Braun’s talk which appeared in 
Tuesday’s Tartan.
It must be obvious to everyone 
who read his article that Daley is 
nohexactly a fact-oriented news- 
writer. He managed to get the 
time and place of the event report­
ed in an unbiased fashion, but the 
rest of his editorial was compris­
ed of “clever” phrases which tried 
to portray von Braun as a cheap 
shyster with flag in hand.
To quote Daly, “von Braun’s 
bag of tricks . . .,” “. . . more 
tricks, more drama (sic), more 
flag waving, etc.” It is difficult to 
believe that Daly could actually 
have written such a drivel after 
having witnessed von Braun’s 
talk.
The scientist’s limited time and 
the technical complexity of the 
subject prevent him from giving 
further uses of the metal foams or 
a timetable for implementation of 
the infra-red techniques for crop 
surveying.

neys” (sic). We believe that the 
article should have objectively re­
ported the highpoints of the talk 
rather than these personal views 
of the reporter.
We hope that in the future the 
author of the article will confine 
himself to expressing his opin­
ions in the editorial column rather 
than in front page news reports.

Editor. The Tartan:
We would like to make some 
comments on the Werner von 
Braun article which appeared in 
the Tartan on Tuesday, Nov. 4. In 
the first place the article more 
closely resembled an editorial 
than a news report. The descrip­
tion of the future space programs 
outlined by Dr. von Braun as. 
"more tricks, more drama, more 
flag waving, etc.,” is simply 'a 
personal viewpoint.
There are many other examples 
of personal bias in the article, in­
cluding the comment on metal 
loams in which the author states. 
"Its use jet propellors hardly 
justifies the great cost of a pro­
gram such as our space jour-
Editor, The Tartan:
I am writing to inquire about 
one peculiarity in your issue of 
Nov. 4, 1969, that is, the absence 
of any article about the speech 
given by Dr. Werhner von Braun, 
while an editorial on the subject 
appeared, of all places, on the 
front page. I am surprised that no 
reporter was sent, for it is quite 
evident that poor Mr. Daly was 
sadly unable to act as one. His lit­
tle polemic contained numerous 
faults, even for a Tartan effort;
i.e.. the statement that there were 
only a few students there? I agree, 
there should have been more, but 
that was a damn big "few.”
In addition. I suggest aht some­
one Xerox and pass around to the 
Tartan staff a dictionary page con­
taining the word “objectivity.” 
Dr. von Braun carried no “bag of 
tricks.” and waved no flags that I 
could see. at least from the third 
row.
I also fail to see why he should 
be taken to task for not providing 
a 40 page monograph on the uses 
of metal foams: the material has 
yet even to be made. I am sure 
that a discussion with the Mech.
E. department would come up 
with a number of suggestions be­
sides jet turbine blades or "jet 
propellers'« ?).
It is also unfortunate that Mr. 
Daly feels that NASA is cruelly 
surpressing the agricultural ap­
plications of space flight in favor 
of a monomaniac devotion to Apol­
lo. There are numerous projects 
being carried out, in many fields, 
not just the moon mission.
All in all, it seems a shame to 
avoid covering an event such as 
this, and instead give the space 
over to a piece of tract writing. 
Certainly not unexpected, but a 
shame, nevertheless.

Flag Removal 
Investigation
Editor. The Tartan:
I have read with great interest 
the recent letters concerning the
racist" incident at the fraternity 
house. If one closely examines 
Mr. Principle's letter, he cannot 
help but come to the conclusion 
that something was omitted from 
the letter when it was published. 
Unlike Bro. Scott. I have taken the 
time and troulbe to find out just 
exactly what was left our of the 
letter. Let me set it forth here:
in no way do I espouse the 
cause or beliefs of the Confeder­
acy. I firmly believe that all peo­
ple should have equal rights and 
that discrimination because of race 
or color is wrong. I think that big­
otry and racism is deplorable. 
But I also believe that a person is 
entitled to think what he wants. 
This is guaranteed in the Bill of 
Rights. I may think a person's 
opinion is wrong and that his be­
liefs are deplorable, but I will de­
fend his right to think as he will. 
Such regimes as Hitler's Ger­
many and present day Russia il­
lustrate the consequences of the 
loss of this right.
"For this reason. I believe that 
the group who insisted on the re­
moval of the flag were in the 
wrong."
In one inserts this paragraph in 
the original letter, it is clear that 
Mr. Principle is not defending a 
racist attitude, rather, he is con­
cerned with "creating an atmos­
phere of free discussion and ac­
ceptance" as he so states.
Exactly who is displaying ra­
cist attitudes? Bro. Scott is con­
cerned with "cold facts." let us 
examine his facts with the differ­
ence of puting them in context. 
First, the incident outside the fra­
ternity house:
Negroes: "Whose flag is that?"
Whites: * I'm not sure, it be­
longs to a brother in the house. "
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Negroes: "We know 
want to know his name.'
Whites: "I couldn't say. sever­
al people live in that room."
Negroes: "Well, we think it 
would be a nice gesture if you'd re­
move it."
Whites: "Why?"
Negroes: "If you don't know 
why then let it stay up there."
The incident later that night oc­
curred substantially as was set 
forth, with one exception. True, 
no Negro student threatened any 
brother, but one Afro voice was 
heard tmremark: "And if you 
don't remove it. we ll go up there 
and remove it!"
So much for that actually tran­
spired. Bro. Scott wants to know 
how many white students saw the 
flag and just kept walking? For 
that matter. Bro. Scott, how many 
black students saw the flag and 
just kept on walking? There are 
about 100 Negro students on cam­
pus. why did only 12 or so actually 
object? Could it possibly be that 
most of them did not see the flag 
as a symbol of oppression and 
slavery, but rather looked at it as 
a reflection of typical Southern 
pride for the land of his birth? 
Yes. Bro. Scott. I checked on that 
too. The man who flew the flag
does hail from the South. Why do 
that, we you object so violently to the
man's right to express his own
personal feelings? Surely he has 
as much right to show his cultural 
heritage as black people do by 
wearing Afros and beating on
drums bv Morewood Gardens.
"It is the mentality of some 
people to believe that because 
black people unite against a def­
initely racist act that they are
also racists." Definitely racist 
act. Bro. Scott? Can you honestly 
believe, now that all the facts are 
clear, that this was a definitely 
racist act?
I seriously doubt it. Rather I 
believe that you. along with 
others, are so blinded by the con­
cept of racism that you cannot see 
any act without tainting it with the 
concept. Where there is no racism 
to be found, you slant things until 
you find it.
Let me point out that you are 
now attending a highly technical­
ly oriented school. Students here 
are not emotionally involved, thus 
leading some people to the conclu­
sion that they don't give a damn. 
They do give a damn. Bro. Scott, 
but they respond to facts. If you 
sincerely want to face reality and 
end "conflicts." I would advise 
you to make sure of your facts 
and to stop reacting emotionally. 
Otherwise you will continue to 
joust with windmills "til etern­
ity and further race relations 
naught."

Architect Offers House Plan
(Editor's Note: The following is a 
copy of a letter sent to Norman L. 
Rice, Dean of the College of Fine 
Arts. A copy was also sent to the 
Tartan. It is written by a former 
architecture student who attended 
Carnegie Tech in the late fifties. In 
an introductor note, Mr. Spencer 
said that he "dropped out when I 
became contused and angry by the 
conflicts Ibegan to perceive.")
Dear Sir:
Where is your sense of propor­
tion?
You are handling and getting 
paid a lot of money to educate 
young people to become archi­
tects. And why? Only one in a mil­
lion or so actually designs to a 
large extent the buildings of the 
cities. A few more help draw up 
the plans. What are you doing 
with all that monev?
U.S. Wins Battles--Why Does War Go On?
Editor. The Tartan:
Tuesday's FY Liberal must be 
responded to on several points.
First the author's misconcep­
tions: there is not direct threat in 
the Vietnam situation to home, 
friends, or loved ones (save those 
in Vietnam). The fact that we may 
have excellent soldiers is no argu­
ment to use them. If the U.S. loses 
prestige by leaving Vietnam, it 
will be mainly with the wealthy 
and ruling classes, and with the 
militarys. Ask the peasants of Vi­
etnam. Thailand. India. Bolivia, 
or any other third world nation 
how they feel. If we are militaril 
victorious on thsbattlefield. why 
haven't we won the war? And as 
to the right of free government: 
the Saigon regime was elected in 
an election in which only pro­
government parties could be rep­
resented: it does not represent 
the majority of the population: it 
survives only with the military 
backing of the U.S.: it imprisoned 
the leading opposition party can­
didate. Free? Ad absurdum.
Secondly, the author displays 
in his "us-them' approach, to 
constant use of the word "ene­
my." an appalling ignorance of 
he real issues in the world today. 
He typifies the mode of thought 
that keeps the merry-go-round of 
arms escalation spiralling on 
while millions suffer, that has at 
least once brought the world to 
the bunk of nuclear holocaust, 
and that mav well obliterate us all
if we don't rise up to stop it.
Lastly, the author states that 
the realization of defeat will de­
mand a scapegoat—a government 
or social system. Well one gov­
ernment has already been brought 
down. If the war does not end an­
other government will fall. And if 
the body of thought, the policy, 
typified by the author continues 
on. an entire social system will 
.fall.
1 hope that reason may yet 
reach this man. and that our lead­
ers will see the inevitable end to 
the course they pursue.
Steve Jurman
Editor. The Tartan:

I read Col. Jacks defense of our 
continued involvement in Viet­
nam (Tartan, Nov. 4>. The sad­
ness came with the realization 
that the colonel must believe his 
own frail arguments. The anger 
arose as I realized that his is the 
ype of thinking which will prolong 
the senseless loss of both Ameri­
can and Vietnamese lives.
His entire argument was based 
on the repercussions, both here 
and abroad, of an American "de­
feat." No questions were asked 
about the morality of our position. 
It seems that there are some peo­
ple who believe that the question
of morality should be left to a se­
lect few in government or to fu­
ture generations of historians. 
Each individual must decide for 
himself if he can support a politi­
cal policy is indefensible. Is it an
* American defeat" if we find the 
courage to admit to a mistake? 
There are few people left in this 
country who will not agree that 
the war has been a huge blunder, 
but there are those who refuse to 
admit this to the world because of 
a host of reasons involving sav­
ing face." The time has come to 
put living with our own consci­
ences above saving face. In the 
end people the world over will re­
spect us more for this.
It is encouraging to see the 
number of people who have de­
cided that the war must end and 
who have given tacit support to 
the March on Washington by shell­
ing out a quarter and wearing 
their button I can only hope that 
these people and a lot more like 
them will decide to do a little 
more. Take a but. get a ride, or 
even hitch to D C. Make your opin­
ion felt by being counted among 
those who are peaceably demon­
strating for peace. It is the only 
way to let our government know 
the number and determination of 
those citizens who oppose this war 
and want it ended now.

Why don’t you educate young 
people to become architects to de­
sign to a large extent the houses 
ordinary people live in? Is the
problem of limited space and in­
come too much for you to solve in­
terestingly?
People need to be employed for 
at least another generation. Better 
it be at construction and peaceful 
production than most other things, 
things. The world certainly can't 
.survive the kinds of warfare and 
destruction possible now. And 
there are many people with a good 
sense of design who with train­
ing and impetus could help their 
communities evolve indigenous 
architecture.
Whether politically left or right 
architecture as a cultural influ­
ence will die completely when 
houses are produced in chemical 
factories. Subdivisions are a half­
measure.
As a matter of fact I thin the 
public has a right to know where 
your private investments are.
Most of your rhetoric that I've 
heard sounds to me like petty 
squabling children or half-sinis­
ter. power monev-mad pedago­
gues leading the naive into stupid­
ities. Surely now with the obvious 
threat of factory-produced houses 
you can get together and lood the 
field with truly human scale ar­
chitects!
A valuable ally might be the 
lumber companies—or. tree farm­
ers. Why don't you talk realistic­
ally with them? You could talk 
with the mining and metals people 
too since they need a substitute 
for war.
Have you thought of advertis­
ing'.1' It really works to educate 
large audiences, they say.
Door die. as I see it.

Mother Pleads 
To All Youths
(Editor’s Note: The following let­
ter and poem were forwarded to 
us by Scott Gatin, a student here. 
Both were written by the mother 
of one of Scott's close friends. Her 
son died recently due to an over­
dose of drugs. The mother's elo­
quent response speaks for itself.)
"Dear Scott,
"Thank you for your letter. I al­
ways knew you and Neal were dif­
ferent, and believe me. I don t 
mean square. You were smart. 
N. he wasn't stupid, just wild and 
immature. And although his name 
meant "Long Life"—he did not ap­
preciate the proverb: Work
makes life that much sweeter.’
"Perhaps we gave too much. We 
loved him and so we always felt 
that if he straightened out and 
flew right we had so much more 
we would give him. The nights are 
long and sleepless and I so ex­
pressed by thoughts two nights af­
ter the funeral. I hope you can get 
it published either by your school 
paper or city newspaper. And they 
can use my name and call it A 
Heart-Broken Mother’s Lament.’ 
If it will do any good. I don't know, 
but I must try to save some of 
those foolish young people who are 
following the same course he took. 
Eveyone thinks it won't happen to 
him.
"Oh no?

in my home. I cannot say that for 
all of the young men of Niel s 
acquaintance.'

THE LAMENT
Dear, dear friends, and people 
whom we have not ever met.
Who have by word or deed tried to 
comfort us in our sorrow;
Sorrow that has enveloped the 
whole community as though a
Pied Piper was luring our youngsters.
To what Utopia is he taking them?
What rainbow—what dazzle can 
he promise?
Why should evil triumph over all 
that was so sweet in life?
Where has the warmth and under­
standing that existed between 
parent and child gone,
Have the polluted air and water so 
demented our reason for living?
This plague has reached epidemic 
proportions!
Anguished and yearning for retri­
bution to the guilty—
Trying hopelessly my anger to 
contain—
My only solace, precious young 
people, I beg you—
RESTRAIN, ABSTAIN, and 
REMAIN.

can Societies sprang up. the Free 
African Society in Newport. R. I., 
as early as 1797: some formed in 
sympathy, some formed in de­
fense. or because of fear. There 
was also a great agitation among 
private black citizens, and it was 
surprising to see how many able 
and wealthy but unknown black 
merchants were in America. " 
Many of these men were not in 
favor of moving back to Africa.
This is understandable in light 
of the fact they they had worked 
and lived in America for nearly 
300 years and there was a consid­
erable feeling that America was 
the home for black Americans."
Several leaders emerged from 
the back-to-Africa movement. 
Marcus Garvey never made it to 
Africa, but he is immensely im­
portant in black America's his­
tory. He was one of the first to 
unite the black workers and give 
them something to hope and work 
for. Dr. DuBois. who died several 
years ago in Ghana, was instru­
mental in the founding of the 
NAACP. He left America, partly 
because of the McCarthy era the 
had been a member of the Com­
munist Party. He was a scholar 
with a brilliant intellect: a man
who felt and worked for his own 
section of the population. "

Many black Americans went to 
Africa, while more and more Af­
ricans were coming to America to 
study. And from these Africans — 
the new and the young—"came 
many who formed the nucleus of 
the modern-day African emer­
gence." as a continent and as in­
dependent nations.
Dr. Nicol reminded us that to 
Africans. America is a foreign 
country. The young Africans, 
while they sympathize with the 
cause of Black Americans, are 
here to study and learn—they are 
also libel to deportation. Remem­
ber these facts when the question
is asked of why they are not more 
deeply involved in your problems.
His Excellency concluded with 
these thoughts: ’ The decision to 
return to Africa is an individual 
choice." It is based on many mo­
tives. Some return because they 
feel strongly about their ancestry 
—is is a return to the motherland. 
Others have gone out of a mission­
ary zeal. But for all. Africa 
weaves a spell; it casts an en-’ 
chantment. It is the fulfillment of 
an emotional dream. ' Africa calls 
to those who can give back. It is a 
world offering an open challenge, 
an invitation.''

In the past, guest lecturers 
sponsored by the Activities Board 
have been honored with luncheons 
on the day of their presentation. 
These luncheons have been open 
to members of the University 
community at the cost of $1.75.
In an effort to attract more stu­
dents to the opportunity of infor­
mal discussion with many dynam­
ic lecturers, the following new po­
licy will be in effect beginning 
with the presentation of the co­
author of 2001: A Space Odessy, 
Arthur C. Clarke on Nov. 11.
Students and faculty may still 
purchase the prepared luncheon 
for $1.75 or they may purchase 
their lunch elsewhere and bring 
it to the designated room.
Due to a limited amount of 
space, we must ask that reserva 
tions be made at Skibo 103 before 
noon on the day preceeding the lec­
ture and luncheon.

Olatunji is one of the most vi­

formances are overpowering and 
dynamic: their impact on the au­
diences is devastating as well as 
provocative. The sound is African
—a powerful blend of percussion, 
rhythm and movement.
Olatunji has been quoted as say­
ing he is ’spreading th^ gospel": 
when he and his ensemble travel 
around the world they give people 
the total experience of African 
music.

Concert, Play Open “Cultures in Contact”
by Patricia McDonald
Music, rhythm, drums, synco­
pation. dancing, history, and her­
itage are but a few of the exciting 
elements tossed at the predomin- 
ently black audience in the open­
ing program of C-MU's African 
Symposium ‘Cultures in Con­
tact."
A 30 minute reception in the lob- 
bv of Skibo was followed by a con­
cert concerned with the many 
moods of “The Spiritual." Pre­
sented by the Westinghous High 
School Concert Choir, directed by 
Mrs. Birdie Nichols, the concert 
muscially examined four aspects 
of the spiritual» 1 > How the spirit­
ual represents the black man s 
emotions and experiences: 2» The 
spiritual's rhythmic out-growth— 
the gospel song: 3> Folk hymns 
and melodies upon which some 
spirituals are based, and 4t The 
spiritual as based upon Biblical 
texts.
The choir's natural ability to 
pick up and sustain syncopated 
rhythms, to convey the exhuber- 
ent as well as somber emotions 
of certain lyrics, and to follow’ the 
intricate musical conversations 
in many of their selections won 
for them the audience's most en­
thusiastic approval. An especial­
ly moving rendition of "0 Happy 
Days" merited a standing ovation.
Black without Blackness." 
written and diredted by Leon Pink­
ney. was a two hour play capsuliz- 
ing the black man s history in 
America. The all-black cast dis­
played varying degrees of disci­
plined agility and choreographic 
skill in the many dances perform­
ed throughout the play—all to the 
rhythm of African drums. The 
drums beat nearly continuously 
during the performance, provid­
ing a unifying element from be­
ginning to end.
The production proceeded from 
the "birth" of the black man. to 
an elaborate tribal dance scene, 
supposedly set in an African vil­
lage. Violently interrupted by the 
white slave traders, the men and 
women are transported to the 
slave ships bound for the "New 
World." The cruelty of the slave 
traders was portrayed quite real­
istically through kickings and 
whippings administered to the 
people and their consequent 
shreiks and screams. An impor­
tant theme evoked here and car­
ried through succeeding scenes 
was that of the rape of the black 
woman by the white man.
The plantation scene portrayed 
the hardships of the black man 
while toiling for his white master. 
After a long day's work one of the 
people relates a long interpreta­
tion of the story of Moses and how 
he freed his people. White enjoy­
ing the exciting story the people 
are interrupted by the master who 
demands to know who among them 
can read, claiming "next you 
know, you'll think you can think!" 
He threatens to whip the entire 
group if he doesn't have an answer 
by morning. Then he leaves, drag­
ging one of the black girls with 
him. One of the women of the 
group despairs and even the com­
bined efforts of her "brothers and 
sisters" cannot keep her from 
carrying out her threat to kill 
herself.
Following intermisstion. two 
well executed dances (the first 
harking back to the African vil­
lage. the second a more modern­
istic exhibition), were performed. 
With this as a bridge, the audi­
ence found itself faced with the 
black man in America today. The 
portrayal of the problems of 
drinking, dope addiction, and 
gambling, ended abruptly with a 
murder. The black man who won 
the dice game was shot by his 
black brother, his scene was im­
mediately followed by a soliloqy 
(a la black), treating the topics 
of thek man's history, the 
black woman's rape, and the prob-

lems of gaining respect in today's 
society. Moving, but difficult to 
hear, the speech 4nded on the idea 
that the black woman respresents 
"nationhood" as well as "moth­
erhood." This scene quickly faded 
into a dance scene, a la TGIF.

Sailors Hold 'Name The Boat’ Contest
The C-MU Sailing Club is currently sponsoring a
• Name the Boat” contest in search of names for its two 
new boats. The winners will receive a free day of sailing 
with a club instructor. All entries should be sent to Box 
215. C-MU. by Nov. 11.
The club is also currently practicing for the Fall 
Frostbite Regatta which is scheduled for Nov. 15. The 
event is bung sponsored by the Sylvan Canoe Club at Ve­
rona. Both boats will be entered in the competition.
Members of the club sail almost every weekend in 
the local waterways. Recent trips have been made to such 
excellent sailing waters as Lake Arthur. Allegheny Res- 
ervoier in New York, and the Allegheny at Verona. Sail­
ing will continue intmthe winter months.
A session was held to teach novices how to sail. Ini­
tially, indoor classes were held to familiarize the neophyte 
with the jargon and theory of sailing, then on-the-water 
lessons were given. This program will also be offered
next semester.
Club activities, in addition to local trips, include 
weekend trips, monthly films, and a scheduled Bahamas 
trip. Ice boating in this area is being investigated.
The members of the club are all avid sailors, and 
many are experienced. The club claims people who have 
sailed both coasts, the Great Lakes, and the Gulf of Mexi­
co, as well as those who have handled ocean racing vessels.

Suggestions for Food Service
Here are some suggestions:
1. I would like to see a greater 
assorment of breakfast rolls 
which were available in previous 
years in which they supply would 
not be depleted before closing 
time.
^ 2. Since very few students arise
early on Sunday, serve at least 
some form of breakfast until 11 or 
11:30 a.m. so that contract stu­
dents wouldn’t be torn between 
two evils, on the seven day plan: 
Either arise earlier than you wish 
or forfeit your breakfast. Fur­
thermore, lunch should be served 
until 2 or 2:30 p.m. on Sundays.
3. I would like to see some pic- 
* kies, olives, radishes, carrots, ce­
lery, etc. served as has been in 
previous years.
4. I agree that students should 
be nice and clear their trays — 
however,
a. Place some auxilary tray 
wagons in the dining area since 
carrying several books and a load­
ed tray for 200 feet or so is awk-
I ward.
b. Often, when students finally 
arrive at the tray conveyor belt, 
a worker there orders them to fit

it onto a tray near the belt which 
itself is near full. After all, whose 
paying and whose getting paid?
5. Special functions should be 
held in the Skibo dining room or 
one of the rarely used 12 faculty 
dining rooms so that all students 
may have access to the Tartan 
Grill every day without having to 
pay a special entrance fee. After 
all, the Tartan Grill is supposed 
to be a facility for the benefit of 
100 per cent of the student body 
and not a proper subset.
Item five applies to Sept. 2. Oct. 
24. and Oct. 25.
6. Please place item one thru 
five in the Tartan and give them 
due consideration.
Thank you, 
6789
Dear 6789:
Thank you for your suggestions 
of Oct. 29. 1969, directed to our at­
tention, through the Food Service 
Committee. We are pleased to 
have received these constructive 
suggestions and have taken the 
following actions:
(1) Several varieties of break­
fast rolls and pastries will be add­
ed to our present menu, and am­
ple supplies will be baked to serve 
our customers until the closing of 
the breakfast line.
(2) A continental breakfast will 
be served fro 10-11 a.m. on Sun­
day mornings. Our patrons may 
select from an assortment of pas­
tries, doughnuts, juices and cof­
fee during this period.
(3) Relish trays will be placed 
on our salad counters for lunch on 
Mondays and Thursdays. This will 
be in addition to our usual salad 
offerings.
(4) An inventory of the present
number of crescents in food serv­
ice is being taken to determine the 
needs of each area. If this proves 
to be inadequate to keep crescents 
in the main cafeteria, we plan to 
order an additional number to keep 
a minimum of four in the cafeteria 
area.

of aiding and abetting the enemy. 
Finally, although he “respects” 
the “idealism” of American 
youth, he apparently picks up the 
vibrations of an even greater 
idealism in the ear-shattering si­
lence of an unidentified majority.
So much for the perversion and 
distortion of the language of 
American democracy. What did 
the President tell us of his inten­
tions? Apparently, based on his 
unannounced plan during the last 
election, he would like to with­
draw an unannounced number of 
American ground troops, in an un­
announced time period, leaving an 
unannounced number of Ameri­
can “support” forces so that 
those unfortunate souls who con­
tribute their flesh and blood to the 
“bloody count” will be predom­
inantly yellow rather than white. 
This policy, mysteriously refer­
red to as “Vietnaminzation,” by 
the most optimistic reading of its 
intent and efficiency could only re­
turn us to the disastrous policy 
pursude by President Kennedy—
having large numbers of Ameri­
can “advisors” maintaining 
with American force another ar­
tificial and unpopular government 
in South Vietnam. Is he kidding? 
We've been there and we know 
where that’s at.
The one aspect of the Presi­
dent’s policy statement that is 
neither sectet nor ambigous is his 
attitude toward legitimate dis­
sent. He considers it an embar­
rassment and humiliation on a 
par with the humiliation of mili­
tary defeat itself. This is surely 
an unhealth attitude but apparent­
ly why he said earlier: “. . . under 
no circumstances will I be af­
fected by it (opposition to the 
war).”
If you happen to be one of those 
“impudent snobs” or “effete in­
tellectuals” who still oppose the 
war, the appropriate response is 
to march on Washington Nov. 15.

Lets Have Peace Now; 
A Reply To Col. Jacks
Sidney Lens To Speak
by Edward Deci
When many millions of people 
stand opposed to something as the 
Vietnam war. where is bound to 
be considerable variance in the 
reasons for their opposition. 
Therefore. I shall not be so pre­
sumptuous as to speak for anyone 
other than myself in responding 
to the Tartan article by the pa­
tronizing Col. Jacks (Nov. 41.
First. I should point out that I 
am not laced with the threat of in­
duction. so my reasons for oppos­
ing the war are not ones of frus­
tration from the fear of being 
drafted.
I would like to outline briefly a 
few of the reasons why I do op­
pose the war and why I think Col. 
Jacks' reasoning is. at best, faulty.
if one looks back through his­
tory he will no doubt be struck by 
the fact that almost as soon as one 
war ended, another was begun. 
Many people feel content to let 
this pattern continue indefinitely. 
Yet in our age of nuclear weapons, 
how can one be this content when 
a slightly maladusted person (or 
would it require three? i could 
take it upon himself (themselves i 
to push the right button* st and an­
nihilate the human race.
Even if that's not possible, there 
there is ample psychological evi­
dence which indicates that when 
confrontation occurs, reason tends 
to be replaced by emotion, and I 
suspect that in one of these wars 
the emotional level might rise to 
the point that a few million peo­
ple would favor pushing the anni­
hilation button.
So much for the people who are 
content with wars forever: now 
about those who do want peace and 
think that their perceptions are 
cateogorically incorrect. Fight­
ing can not be a means to the end 
peace: fighting is an end in itself. 
It cannot lead to anything but 
more fighting (except as I said, 
annihilation t.
I strongly believe that the only 
way we can have peace is to live 
peace. That means, don’t fight. 
Can we not have enough faith in 
humanity to believe that if we live 
peace, so will others? Perhaps 
there would be short run skirmish­
es. but in the long run. I see it as 
the only hope.
Let me now be a bit more prag­
matic. I wonder how Col. Jacks 
and others would feel if France. 
England or some other world pow­
er had substantially intervened in 
our own Civil War to lead the 
South (with its ideals of slavery 
and racism i to victory? I imagine 
they would have been damn mad. 
A country should be allowed to 
settle its own internal difficulties. 
I don't think war should be the way 
of settlement of any disagreement 
(but I shall not get philosophical, 
this is my pragmatic paragraph *.
Further, if one looks around 
him (here in Pittsburgh or where- 
ever he be in the U.S. i. he will see 
enormous problems which I feel 
are more worthy of our attention 
than is the war. The lives of thou­
sands of young men and the count­
less billions of dollars that are be­
ing wasted could far better be 
spent here at home.
The way Col. Jacks views the 
lives of young Americans — as one 
more commodity to be expended 
—makes me ill. How can be trade 
off lives for prestige? I could not 
care less about our saving pres­
tige.” And furthermore. I think 
we'd gain considerable more pres­
tige than we'd lose if we pulled 
out of Vietnam.
And I for one would not consider 
withdrawal a defeat. Rather than 
being a defeated person looking 
for a “scapegoat." I'd be an elat­
ed person looking for self-actual­
ization. I fear that the continued 
fighting is what will lead millions 
of Americans to feel defeated.
As for the point about having 
other countries “offer us bases. " 
I can think of few things that I'd 
like better than for each country 
not to allow the bases of other 
countries' into its country.
Perhaps if we stopped talking so 
much about “our enemy” and 
“showing them that we mean busi­
ness,” we could begin to talk 
about our fellow humans and show­
ing them we want to co-exist in 
peace.
On Nov. 13. I shall go to Wash­
ington to take part in the “March 
Against Death " and the Moratori­
um rally. I urge all of you to go. It 
is hard for me to see how you 
could fail to support this effort for 
peace. We must make the Presi­
dent see that the people want 
peace now and will not settle for 
anything short of that.
