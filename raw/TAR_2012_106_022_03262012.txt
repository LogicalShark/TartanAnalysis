Motion to impeach SBP Flittner failsCandidates vow 
policy reforms
OMx asks how to achieve happiness
EMILY DOBLER
Editor-in-Chief
Jake Flittner remains stu-
dent body president after 
Thursday evening’s joint Un-
dergraduate Student Senate 
and Graduate Student As-
sembly (GSA) meeting. The 
vote for impeachment did not 
of?cially occur, as GSA did not 
have enough members attend-
ing to meet its 3/4 quorum.
Flittner, a senior mechani-
cal engineering and engineer-
ing and public policy double 
major, faced impeachment 
hearings after Senate unani-
mously requested on March 
1 that he be removed from of-
?ce. At Thursday’s meeting, 
the impeachment motion was 
presented to the joint session, 
and Flittner presented argu-
ments in defense of his role. 
GSA donates to CMU endowment
BRENT HEARD
Assistant News Editor
The Graduate Student As-
sembly (GSA) recently voted 
to contribute $175,000 from 
its capital reserve funds to 
the of?cial Carnegie Mellon 
endowment.
As GSA president and 
economics Ph.D. student 
Jason Imbrogno wrote in the 
of?cial announcement of this 
decision, “This is a testament 
to both the strength of our 
graduate student body and 
its leadership. I venture to 
say that nowhere else in the 
world is another student 
government wrestling with 
such signi?cant decisions 
that can impact their 
university communities to 
such a high degree.”
Imbrogno thanked GSA 
Vice President for Finance 
Will Boney, Vice President for 
Campus Affairs Michael Mur-
phy, and GSA Vice President 
for Finance Grace Heckmann 
for their assistance in this 
process.
Andy Schultz, materials 
science Ph.D. student and 
Vice President for Campus 
Affairs for the GSA, preferred 
to frame the contribution in 
terms of an investment rather 
than a donation. 
“The GSA will get income 
from interest on that money, 
which can be used to fund ac-
tivities,” Schultz explained. 
“This money directly bene?ts 
graduate students immedi-
ately.”
Electrical and computer 
engineering Ph.D. student 
Peter Klemperer said that he 
was “a little surprised that 
GSA had that much money 
left over” for such a donation.
The GSA capital reserve 
has increased in size over the 
past few years due to unspent 
student activities fees and 
budget surpluses, and Im-
brogno has stated that spend-
ing down the surplus in this 
account would be a main goal 
of his presidency. 
Heckmann said in an 
email that prior to the dona-
tion, there had been about 
$220,000 in the GSA capital 
reserve.
Klemperer had greater 
support for the idea of col-
lecting interest on the money, 
which he said he had not 
previously been aware of. 
“That wasn’t explained at all 
that way in the email from 
the GSA president,” he said. 
Klemperer still expressed 
concern over the quantity of 
funds the GSA had sitting in 
the capital reserve account.
Imbrogno stated in the 
same announcement that the 
GSA would also appropriate 
$35,000 from the capital re-
serve account for a new cam-
pus bike rack project. Schultz 
explained that the choice to 
fund the new bike rack proj-
ect resulted from a survey 
sent around last year asking 
for input on what the GSA 
should fund.
“The resounding answer 
was bike racks,” Schultz said.
The project is currently 
being overseen by a commit-
tee consisting of GSA mem-
bers, Undergraduate Student 
Senate representatives, and 
faculty members. It includes 
the plans to create a bike sta-
tion in currently available 
space in the Gates Center ga-
rage.
Schultz concluded that 
the funds and interest gained 
from this contribution would 
“go toward projects that 
would bene?t graduate stu-
dents for a long time.”

The OM organization 
brought ?ve speakers and a 
dance group to the Carnegie 
Music Hall on Saturday to 
share their views on happi-
ness in an event called OMx.
The ?ve speakers were Tim 
Bono, a professor of psychol-
ogy at Washington University 
in St. Louis; Hari Chandan, a 
post-doctoral fellow at Carn-
egie Mellon’s department of 
engineering and public policy; 
Indira Nair, Carnegie Mellon’s 
former vice provost for educa-
tion; Patty Eppley, a medita-
tion expert; and Helen Wang, 
a Carnegie Mellon housefel-
low. They were joined by the 
Pitt Nrityamala, an Indian 
classical dance team.
Bono discussed the ways 
the focus of one’s attention 
determines one’s happiness. 
He described studies which 
showed that people randomly 
assigned to think about good 
things that had happened to 
them in the previous week 
became happier than people 
randomly assigned to think 
about bad things. “One of the 
easiest ways to increase hap-
piness is to regularly practice 
gratitude,” Bono said.
Chandan explained the 
Hindu spiritual approach to 
happiness. He told a parable 
of two birds sitting in a tree. 
One eats fruit, some sweet 
and some sour, and is happy 
and sad accordingly. The oth-
er eats nothing, and is ful?lled 
of its own glory. Occasionally, 
the fruit-eating bird glimpses 
the ful?lled bird. Chandan 
said that our true nature is 
that of the ful?lled bird.
“If our real nature is that 
in?nite happiness, why don’t 
we see it? Because we are 
too distracted all the time,” 
Chandan said. He described 
the four Hindu paths to hap-
piness: knowledge, devotion, 
action, and meditation.
Nair said that she be-
lieves happiness can be found 
through authenticity, integri-
ty, and mindfulness. When she 
took her children to campus in 
the ’80s, they asked her, “Why 
does nobody smile at Carnegie 
Mellon?” By the ’90s, she said, 
the campus was happier. Nair 
said that one of the reasons 
for the change is that there is 
more love at Carnegie Mellon 
now. According to Nair, love, 
connection, and kindness are 
the keys to happiness, and 
they can be achieved by prac-
ticing authenticity, integrity, 
and mindfulness.
Junior information systems 
major Christian Reyes said 
that he connected to Nair’s 
presentation. “She spoke right 
to me, with the idea that you 
don’t have to worry about 
what others think,” he said. 
“That really resonated.”
Eppley focused on medi-
tation. She said that regular 
meditation had made her a 
happy person. Eppley said 
that in her adult life, she had 
once been a “crisis meditator” 
who only meditated when 
things went wrong. Then, she 
said, her life fell apart. She 
went to study meditation with 
Deepak Chopra, a physician 
who specializes mind-body 
medicine. Later, Eppley was 
going to travel to India to ?nd 
a guru, but found she did not 
need to. “The guru is within,” 
Eppley said.
Wang discussed her per-
sonal journey to happiness, 
speaking about pain. She said 
that discussing and acknowl-
edging our pain is not detri-
mental to happiness, nor is it 
necessarily sel?sh. “When we 
give our story to the world, 
we celebrate our common hu-
manity. We create safe spaces 
for others to have their pain 
lifted off of them. And when 
we do that, we create happi-
ness.”
Wang told a story about 
her ?rst years in America. She 
would bring lunches full of her 
mother’s cooking to school, 
and other students made fun 
of it because it looked and 
smelled strange to them. 
Eventually, Wang traded her 
beloved curry for turkey sand-
wiches and juice boxes.
After she grew up, though, 
Wang said that she learned 
that she was denying a huge 
part of who she is. She said 
that she stopped doing that, 
started being who she really 
was, and became happier. 
Wang stressed that, in order 
to be happy, we need to be our 
effortless, authentic selves. 
“We walk in the world as if we 
were broken, but really, ev-
erything that we have is more 
than enough.”
Attendees liked Wang’s 
section of the presentation. “I 
thought she had a good per-
spective on Carnegie Mellon 
students,” said Vicente Estra-
da, a ?rst-year in CIT.
“She seemed to really be-
lieve what she was saying,” 
said junior cognitive science 
major Susan Dou. “If she 
didn’t have her notes, I bet she 
would have made the same 
speech.”
The six presentations were 
structured around a narra-
tive, delivered by junior in-
formation systems and deci-
sion science double major 
Archit Kumar, the president 
of OM. Kumar played a Carn-
egie Mellon student named 
Arjun Patel, a senior chemi-
cal engineering major, who 
was searching for happiness. 
Each of the presentations was 
meant to be a person or ex-
perience Arjun engaged with 
along his journey.
First-year CIT student Vi-
jay Iyengar, one of OMx’s co-
chairs, said that the point of 
OMx was not to teach happi-
ness, but to make attendees 
think about the way they prac-
tice happiness in their own 
lives. Every speaker touched 
on that idea. “The shortest 
distance between point A and 
point B is a straight line. And 
each of our speakers converg-
es into one straight line,” Iyen-
gar said.
He said that he has already 
started putting some of the 
speakers’ ideas into practice 
in his own life. In particular, 
he said, he has taken Eppley’s 
advice to heart. “I have start-
ed taking ?ve minutes out of 
each day to just step back and 
distance myself.”
Proceeds from OMx were 
donated to the Ekal Vidyalaya 
Foundation, which sets up sin-
gle-teacher schools in small 
villages.

Three ?rst-year Mellon 
College of Science students 
placed second in the William 
Lowell Putnam Mathematical 
Competition. The students — 
math majors Michael Drug-
gan, Albert Gu, and Archit 
Kulkarni — are members 
of the Knaster-McWilliams 
Scholars program, which is 
funded by two alumni and 
provides students with in-
creased access to faculty and 
early research opportunities.
To win second place, 
Druggan, Gu, and Kulkarni 
answered 12 math problems 
in six hours. Over 4,000 
American and Canadian un-
dergraduates participated in 
the tournament, which was 
held in December. The results 
were released this month.
“This remarkable success 
is a re?ection of the high 
caliber of students in Carn-
egie Mellon’s Department 
of Mathematical Sciences, 
as well as a re?ection on the 
students’ hard work and ded-
ication,” said mathematics 
professor Po-Shen Loh, the 
team’s coach, in a university 
press release. “At Carnegie 
Mellon we have developed 
an innovative undergradu-
ate program, which leads 
the brightest undergraduate 
mathematicians to achieve 
their full potential.”
Druggan, Gu, and Kulkar-
ni’s second-place ?nish is the 
highest a Carnegie Mellon 
team has ever placed in the 
competition. The Depart-
ment of Mathematical Sci-
ences will receive $20,000 
as a result, and Druggan, Gu, 
and Kulkarni will each re-
ceive $800.

False Alarms/Criminal 
Mischief/Assault
March 14, 2012
University Police and se-
curity of?cers responded to 
?re alarms in seven academic 
building and residence halls. 
All were false alarms and had 
been set off via pull stations. 
Shortly after the alarms, Uni-
versity Police were alerted to 
a male acting erratically at the 
intersection of Forbes Avenue 
and Margaret Morrison. 
The male was found to be 
in possession of illegal drugs 
and drug paraphernalia. He 
was placed under arrest and 
bragged about pulling the 
alarms. He assaulted a Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh police of-
?cer and an Allegheny County 
jail guard following his arrest. 
Charges have been ?led.
De?ant Trespass
March 17, 2012
University Police respond-
ed to the Fence for a report 
of a suspicious female who 
was intoxicated and making 
inappropriate comments to 
students. Upon arrival, the 
female was identi?ed and 
checked for warrants with 
negative results. She was giv-
en a de?ant trespass warning 
and escorted off campus.
Vandalism
March 19, 2012
University Police received 
a report that there had been 
an act of vandalism and 
graf?ti in the restroom of the 
Quizno’s restaurant located 
at 300 South Craig St. The 
owner wanted University 
Police to be aware and be 
familiar with the graf?ti in 
case there were similar cases 
on campus. This case is still 
under investigation.
Suspicious Activity
March 19, 2012
A Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent, who resides in Shady 
Oak Apartments, reported 
getting a suspicious phone 
call from a male alleging that 
he was a maintenance man for 
Ascension Church and that he 
wanted to meet her there to 
give her a package that was 
addressed to her. University 
Police investigated and iden-
ti?ed the male. The male has 
denied wrongdoing, and no 
criminal charges have been 
?led. He has been barred from 
the Shady Oaks property.

that person was refusing to 
return the phone unless the 
owner paid a $200 “reward.” 
University Police contacted 
Pittsburgh Police and Port Au-
thority Police and assisted in 
the arrest of the suspect.
Campus Crime & Incident Reports

Statistically Speaking
The Fence tradition began in 1923 when the senior 
class painted a soon-to-be-demolished wooden fence 
to advertise a party. Destruction was postponed, and 
the Fence is now perhaps the most recognizable and 
beloved part of Tartan school spirit. With an 89-year 
history that includes such events as reconstruction af-
ter collapse, wedding proposals, and vandalization, the 
Fence has been through a lot. Here are a few facts about 
the Fence that you may not have known:

Junior economics and sta-
tistics and decision science 
double major Will Weiner 
has been involved with stu-
dent government since his 
?rst year at Carnegie Mellon. 
Weiner says that there are 
a lot of changes that need to 
be made. “Problems have not 
been addressed well, and I’m 
going to attack them from dif-
ferent angles,” Weiner said. 
Weiner is the Student Sen-
ate Chair, on the Pittsburgh 
Student Government Council, 
is heading a lobby trip, has 
helped with musical produc-
tions, and is a head orienta-
tion counselor. While Weiner 
has a lot of management po-
sitions, he said that “it’s not 
about [those positions] but 
about seeing people happy.”
Weiner’s running mate, 
junior creative writing and 
professional writing double 
major Meela Dudley, said, 
“Without reading our resume, 
we’re basically the same per-
son. We’re both very busy — 
but we’ve cleared our sched-
ules for this. We’ve sealed up 
our different positions and we 
have three main objectives: 
recruitment, communication, 
and presentation.”
Their initiatives focus 
on communication and fun. 
Weiner aims to make a logo 
for the student body presi-
dent. Student Senate has a 
logo already, but the president 
doesn’t. In order to maintain 
communication with the gen-
eral public, Weiner said that 
they would maintain their 
website after elections.
“We’d post mad minutes 
every two weeks,” Weiner 
said. Mad minutes would be 
a summary of things they’ve 
covered in meetings. “And if 
we don’t do something [or] 
get something that we said we 
would done, we want you to 
hold us accountable to it.”

Senior materials science 
and engineering and biomedi-
cal engineering double major 
Matthew Biegler is running an 
unorthodox presidential cam-
paign. 
With his slogan, “Cat-Hat 
Party. Cats cannot walk, cats 
cannot talk,” a platform of 
seemingly unlikely ideas, and 
a colorful campaign website, 
Biegler is turning heads.
Biegler has a 13-step plan if 
he is elected into of?ce. One of 
the steps involves implement-
ing a balloon room on campus. 
Another step is to have a limo 
shuttle going from the Skibo 
Gym to Morewood Gardens. 
Only students living in More-
wood would be allowed to 
take the limo shuttle.
“This is awful,” said Ninar 
Nuemah, senior electrical and 
computer engineering major. 
“It seems like he’s not taking it 
very seriously, and he’s most-
ly doing it as a joke, which is 
amusing but stupid.”
When asked if Biegler and 
his running mate, second-
year architecture student 
Amy Friedman, were taking 
this election seriously, Biegler 
said, “We’re on the ballot.”
“I think they’re funny, but 
it’s kind of obnoxious also that 
he’s up there stealing votes. 
Those votes can be going to 
people [who need it],” said 
?rst-year physics major Sonal 
Nanda.
As testimony to his creden-
tials, Biegler said that he went 
to a student government meet-
ing last year and that he has 
good ideas. 
“[Our ideas] are actually 
outlined in our platform and 
it’s on our website. We are the 
?rst candidates to have a plat-
form and a website,” Biegler 
said. 
Biegler also said he was a 
cabinet member under former 
student body president Jarett 
Adams two years ago and was 
on an election campaign com-
mittee last year. Due to these 
experiences, Biegler said he 
knew that a lot of money  went 
into the Executive Board and 
that there was a large working 
budget.
“I’m hoping to utilize that 
[budget],” Biegler said. “I’ve 
felt that it may’ve been under-
utilized in the past. I’m not 
sure. I really don’t know any-
thing about student govern-
ment.”
Biegler’s campaign website 
is mattyb4prez.angel?re.com.

“We’re not a joke cam-
paign. We’re a serious can-
didate,” said Amy Quispe, a 
junior computer science and 
math double major.
Quispe and junior eco-
nomics and computer science 
double major Bryan Wade 
decided to run because they 
wanted to make it easier for 
students to get things done, 
to form student organiza-
tions, and to get funding. “We 
thought there was a lot of red 
tape in student government; 
it is hard to start student orga-
nizations and get funding as 
well,” Wade said.
Quispe and Wade are both 
Student Senators this year. 
They said that, as Senators, 
they have realized that a lot of 
problems exist within student 
government. As student body 
president and vice president, 
Quispe and Wade say they 
could ?x those problems.
One of the problems they 
wish to address is with the 
Committee on Student Or-
ganization’s (CoSO) student 
group policy. Quispe and 
Wade said that the current 
policy is very strict as to how 
a student group may be-
come recognized, because 
once they are recognized as 
a group, they immediately 
get funding. As such, CoSO 
doesn’t accept student groups 
very easily.
“We want to make it so 
there is another group type 
that it’s very easy to become 
recognized but it’s ineligible 
for funding, so that CoSO 
doesn’t have to worry about 
this funding issue,” Wade 
said. “People can become of-
?cial groups, and can use 
SpaceQuest, and go to the 
activities fair and poster — do 
all these things that they don’t 
need funding for.”
“We really feel that what 
students can make and what 
students can do is most im-
portant,” Quispe said. “And 
removing red tape, whether 
that’s improving the CoSO 
process, opening up data, 
making it easier for student 
projects to become of?cial.... 
It’s all about making this cam-
pus more alive.”

Neither junior information 
systems and human-computer 
interaction double major Bri-
an Groudan nor decision sci-
ence and psychology double 
major Amanda Ho Sang have 
held any student government 
positions. However, Groudan 
was on the TedxCMU team, 
was an orientation counselor 
for Mudge for two years, is a 
teaching assistant, and will 
be an RA in West Wing next 
year. He said he is running 
for of?ce because he wants to 
give back to the student body 
and to “a campus that’s given 
[him] so much.”
“I think that through the 
things I’ve been involved 
with, I have a really good per-
spective and reach on cam-
pus,” Groudan said.
Ho Sang said she has been 
part of Dancers’ Symposium, 
has served on the Dance Mar-
athon Executive Committee, 
and was a teaching assistant.
“I think that Brian and I, 
collectively, have had a lot of 
different experiences here at 
CMU, and we’ve really tried 
to take advantage of all the 
things we are a part of,” Ho 
Sang said.
Groudan and Ho Sang said 
they have four main areas 
they intend to focus on. Two 
of the areas are balance and 
ef?ciency. By balance, they 
mean using recreational plac-
es to create a stress-free work-
ing environment for students 
and having convenient trans-
portation for students to use. 
By ef?ciency, they mean 
streamlining certain pro-
cesses to make students’ lives 
easier, making it more con-
venient for students to access 
information, and creating a 
digital and physical calendar.
“The core aspect of student 
body president and vice presi-
dent,” Groudan said, “is to be 
the voice of the students, and 
that’s the approach we’ve tak-
en in our campaign.”

Junior economics major 
Seth Vargo and junior infor-
mation systems major Joe 
Frick decided to run because 
they want to keep moving 
student government forward. 
Some of the initiatives they 
would like to accomplish are: 
improving dining, getting the 
university to give back to stu-
dents, and empowering stu-
dents to accomplish their own 
ideas.
“I have really good re-
lationships with CulinArt. 
Through my experience and 
conversations with them, it’s 
actually not CulinArt’s fault 
[that food is subpar], but the 
university’s because the uni-
versity forces them to serve 
certain food,” Vargo said. “So 
instead of trying to get bet-
ter food on campus, we want 
to extend dining and bring 
DineX or at least PlaidCash to 
start down Craig Street and 
into Oakland.”
The university taxes alum-
ni donations by 5 percent, so 
an organization only actually  
receives $95 of a $100 dona-
tion. This tax was enacted last 
year and will increase to 6.9 
percent, and then 9.6 percent 
in the following years. “We’d 
really like to see the universi-
ty give back to the students,” 
Vargo said.
Vargo and Frick say that 
they also intend to empower 
students by helping them ac-
complish their own ideas. 
“Instead of saying ‘we’ll take 
care of it,’ we’ll say, ‘what do 
you need to get it done?’ So 
if someone has an idea, we’re 
going to give them the oppor-
tunity to run with it on their 
own before we say we’ll do it 
for you,” Vargo said. “A single 
individual can make a differ-
ence, and we want to make 
sure they know that.”
Campaign
“Empowering You.”
Amy Quispe
She took a gap year to 
go to Germany to work 
for a volunteer organi-
zation, lobbied to sell 
cacti in Dutch despite 
not speaking Dutch, has 
programmed since she 
was a kid, and has a full 
tuition scholarship.
Bryan Wade
He went to the same 
high school as Bill 
Gates.
Campaign
“Your Voice, Your 
Choice.”
Brian Groudan
He is half Chinese and 
half European, and  is 
from New York. He’s 
also taken a class in ev-
ery college except for 
CIT.
Amanda Ho Sang
She lived in Singapore 
for 10 years, her par-
ents are from Jamaica, 
she studied in Oxford, 
and she once saw 
Emma Watson on the 
street.
Campaign
“In Plaid We Trust.”
Seth Vargo
He owns three compa-
nies, works 60 hours a 
week for the university, 
was offered $250,000 
to drop out of school at 
a conference, and once 
worked for a site that 
was hacked by a foreign 
country.
Joe Frick
He had a year-and-a-half 
modeling stint that he 
didn’t think he would 
do, got three of his ?n-
gers crushed by Vargo 
karate kicking a door, 
played baseball twice in 
the PNC Park, and has 
kissed the Stanley Cup.

VPO candidates run on platforms of reforms
Rishi PatelAlyssa Danesh
MADELYN GLYMOUR
News Editor
Sophomore business ad-
ministration and decision sci-
ence double major Rishi Patel 
is running on a platform of 
funding improvements. Patel, 
who is currently a member of 
the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC), believes that funding is 
one of the most pressing prob-
lems Carnegie Mellon student 
organizations are facing.
“Funding is de?nitely an 
issue right now,” Patel said. 
“Right now JFC has cut a lot 
of budgets because we don’t 
have enough money to allo-
cate to all the organizations.”
To relieve student organi-
zations of some of their ?nan-
cial burdens, Patel says that 
he would work to improve 
organizations’ relationships 
with their alumni and foster 
communication between JFC 
and the Committee on Stu-
dent Organizations (CoSO).
“Alumni relations is a great 
way to tap into an untapped 
resource and get money for 
organizations,” Patel said. As 
vice president for organiza-
tions, Patel said that he would 
try to show student organi-
zations how to connect to 
alumni. Patel said that his fra-
ternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 
has the best alumni relations 
program on campus, and that 
he would use the knowledge 
he has gained there to help 
other organizations.
Patel said that he would 
also work to institute meet-
ings between JFC and CoSO 
once a semester. “I want to 
make sure that people on JFC 
know the CoSO process, be-
cause right now they really 
don’t know that much about 
it. I feel like you have to have 
knowledge of both JFC and 
CoSO to be on either organi-
zation,” Patel said.
Patel also said that he 
would like to create a booklet 
of best practices for organi-
zations. The booklet would 
contain information on how 
to get space on campus, how 
to fundraise, and other strate-
gies that Patel feels organiza-
tions should understand. The 
Of?ce of Student Activities 
currently publishes an annual 
handbook for student organi-
zations that explains the rec-
ognition and funding process-
es, space and event planning, 
and university policies.
Patel’s platform also in-
cludes plans to revamp the 
current CoSO organization 
categories, promote an in-
crease of the Student Activi-
ties Fee, and establish awards 
for well-run student organiza-
tions.
Patel hopes to advocate for 
student organizations. “Right 
now, if you’re a member of an 
organization, it’s hard for you 
to get your voice out there to 
representatives in the admin-
istration. I feel like the VPO’s 
the person who represents 
the organizations, and bridg-
es the gap between them and 
the administration.”

Alyssa Danesh, a sopho-
more electrical and computer 
engineering major, is running 
on a platform of strengthen-
ing the Committee on Student 
Organizations (CoSO) and 
improving communications 
with student organizations.
As vice president for orga-
nizations, Danesh said that 
she would improve the trans-
parency of the organization 
recognition process; make 
CoSO stronger and more ef-
?cient; educate organizations 
about CollegiateLink, the pro-
posed new platform that will 
replace BudgetTracker and 
OrgTracker; and act as an ad-
vocate for student organiza-
tions.
Danesh, who is serving her 
second year on CoSO, said 
that she would set clear dead-
lines for the organization rec-
ognition process.
She also wants to ensure 
that people take CoSo seri-
ously by making members 
reapply each year. “This year, 
the Committee on Student 
Organizations is made up 
of about 15 people, and we 
have a big problem with at-
tendance,” Danesh said. “We 
have a big problem with tak-
ing things seriously, and it is 
a pretty serious thing. Being 
recognized means a lot to an 
organization. It means we’re 
giving them the Student Ac-
tivities Fee. It’s a lot of money. 
I think that it’s important that 
the people in CoSO are taking 
it seriously.”
Danesh said that she also 
wishes to establish of?ce 
hours to educate student or-
ganizations on CollegiateLink 
in the hope that they will use 
the platform more heavily 
than they currently use Org-
Tracker. 
She also plans to speak 
to the leaders of established 
organizations to compile a 
database of advice for new or-
ganizations on how to run an 
organization effectively.
Danesh is also the current 
chair of the Senate Communi-
cations Committee. 
Danesh said that during 
her time on Communications 
Committee, she worked to 
rebrand Student Senate. She 
said that the experience has 
taught her how to communi-
cate with the student body, an 
ability which she feels is key 
to the role of VPO.
“As it stands right now, 
organizations look at the 
VPO and say, ‘Oh, okay, so it’s 
this person who I have to go 
through for recognition. So 
I’m going to get recognized, 
and once a year I’ve got to 
do this,’ ” Danesh said. “And 
that’s part of the role of VPO. 
But the big part of it is acting 
as that advocate. You’re the 
vice president of organiza-
tions, so the organizations are 
what you’re representing. I 
think that it’s very important 
that the VPO act more as that 
kind of advocate.”

He emphasized that Senate 
and GSA members should 
“stick to the constitution” 
when deciding their vote, 
arguing that he has ful?lled 
nearly every duty that is out-
lined for his position in the 
Student Body Constitution.
During his defense, 
Flittner admitted to missing 
a few meetings and to a lack 
of concrete progress toward 
achieving his campaign goals. 
Speci?cally, he addressed the 
issue of transparency between 
himself and Student Senate, 
saying that it was the “biggest 
one that we failed at.” How-
ever, Flittner made sure to 
emphasize that, despite what 
he felt to be small failures, he 
accurately “represented the 
voice of the student body to 
the administration” through-
out his term.
Flittner made comparisons 
to the previous student body 
president, Jarrett Adams. He 
said, “Stepping into this of?ce, 
I didn’t have a single docu-
ment from my predecessor.... 
I came into this with a clean 
slate.” He also criticized the 
vague wording of the Student 
Body Constitution, especially 
in the representation section 
of his duties.
Senate, GSA, and others 
present then discussed the im-
peachment motion for almost 
an hour. A common theme of 
the discussion was a debate 
whether the motion for im-
peachment should be based 
on the president’s constitu-
tional duties or on Student 
Senate’s satisfaction with 
Flittner’s progress.
Senator Seth Vargo, a se-
nior information systems 
major and a candidate in this 
year’s student body presiden-
tial race, did not seem im-
pressed by Flittner’s defense. 
He especially disagreed with 
Flittner’s critique of the Stu-
dent Body Constitution. “The 
purpose of this meeting isn’t 
to decide the bylaws and con-
stitution, but whether he’s ful-
?lled them,” he said. “Even if 
it wasn’t part of his platform, 
I would have expected that he 
would have moved to change 
them during his term.”
Student Body Vice Presi-
dent for Organizations Will 
Zhang, a senior computer 
science major, sided with 
Flittner. “I agree with a lot of 
Jake’s points. Honestly, I re-
ally don’t think it’s a big deal 
anyway,” he said. “I think [the 
Executive Committee] is well 
run. I think the only part of 
what he hasn’t really ful?lled 
is his discretionary objectives. 
Speaking as a second semester 
senior, it’s really easy to check 
out.”
Zhang continued, touch-
ing on Flittner’s ful?llment 
of his constitutional duties. 
“They’re guidelines. You can’t 
follow them 100 percent,” he 
said. “If you want to impeach 
him because you haven’t seen 
tangible results, then that’s a 
valid reason.”
Andrew Ramey, a doc-
toral student in history who 
was present at the hearing, 
summarized his feelings on 
Flittner’s performance suc-
cinctly. “He admitted to not 
ful?lling his duties,” he said. 
“This is a cut and dry case. You 
can’t pick and choose.”
Senator Jon Mark, a ju-
nior lighting design major 
and current candidate for 
student body vice president 
for ?nance, initially called 
for Flittner’s impeachment 
and made the ?nal comment 
before the discussion period 
closed. “I think it comes back 
a lot to perception issues,” he 
said. “The things that were 
moving along, that were 
happening, were a result of 
[Student Body Vice President 
Sangita Sharma]. I know she 
wants to say they’re a team, 
but when it comes to student 
government, she would do 
a better job.... Senate really 
does believe that doing this is 
the right thing to be doing for 
the student body.”
After discussion, Senate 
Chair Will Weiner, a junior 
social and decision science 
and economics and statistics 
double major, called for a 
vote from both bodies. Due to 
GSA’s lack of quorum, the vote 
was unof?cial, but the votes 
were still tallied. Undergradu-
ate Student Senate voted 19–8 
in favor of impeachment, and 
GSA voted 22–23. 
Flittner would not have 
been impeached even had the 
votes been of?cial, as neither 
body achieved the required 
3/4 super majority of votes in 
favor of the motion. Because 
the request for impeachment 
was only valid for three weeks 
and the vote did not occur, the 
motion expired.
Re?ecting on the event, 
Sharma felt good about the 
discussion at the hearing. 
“It provided great feedback. 
I was genuinely happy with 
both sides of the argument. 
Nothing was a personal at-
tack, nothing was too one-
sided,” she said. “I think it was 
really well discussed. I think 
that people responded well to 
Jake’s defense.... People un-
derstood that a lot of this was 
a miscommunication on both 
ends. People came in with an 
open mind, which is great.”
Moving forward, she hopes 
that she and Flittner can work 
to improve transparency and 
communication for the re-
mainder of their terms, as well 
as improve the transition to 
new leadership. “I think that 
Jake and I will work really 
hard to make sure that whoev-
er comes in next year has that 
message,” she said. “We’re go-
ing to work towards constitu-
tion changes and make things 
more clear.”
“We don’t want them to 
come in unprepared,” Sharma 
said, speaking about the cur-
rent student body president 
candidates. “A lot of people 
are running this year, and 
no matter who comes in, this 
job is a lot different than they 
think.”

Junior lighting design 
major Jon Mark is the only 
candidate running for stu-
dent body vice president for 
?nance, but he is still cam-
paigning.
“The VPF role is organized 
around the student organi-
zations: managing student 
accounts, making sure every-
one plays by the rules, and di-
viding up the student activi-
ties fee,” Mark said.
As vice president of ?-
nance, Mark said he wants 
to “bring back knowledge to 
everyone” about the ?nancial 
process of hosting events by 
holding of?ce hours.
“They’d be laid back, fun, 
and we’d work to get an event 
down to the correct budget,” 
he said.
As for experience, Mark 
has served in the Undergrad-
uate Student Senate for every 
possible semester of his Carn-
egie Mellon education, and 
has served on the Joint Fund-
ing Committee (JFC).
Speaking about his expe-
rience serving on the JFC, 
Mark said, “Looking at the 
process, I don’t see it as ef?-
cient.”
As part of his plans to im-
prove the process by which 
the JFC operates, Mark said 
that he wants “to put more 
power into the hands of the 
representatives to make a 
recommendation” regarding 
an activities budget.
In terms of the student 
activities fee, Mark is in sup-
port of a 20 percent increase. 
He said that the budgets cur-
rently being requested by 
student organizations would 
require a 40 percent increase 
in funding, and he wants to 
meet that number halfway, 
“invest[ing] that 20 percent 
back into CMU.”
“I’m a pretty intimidating 
character; I wouldn’t want to 
run against me either,” Mark 
said, joking about his status 
as the only vice president for 
?nance candidate.
Switching to a more seri-
ous tone, Mark added that he 
was surprised that, for two 
consecutive years, no one 
has run for what he considers 
“the most powerful position” 
up for election.

Catapulting mechanism behind fern reproduction
Instead of using seeds or 
?owers to reproduce, ferns 
replicate by dispersing spores 
into the air. Using a high 
speed camera, scientists from 
the University of Nice-Sophia 
Antipolis and the National 
Center for Scienti?c Research 
in France were able to study 
the catapulting mechanism 
that ferns use to scatter their 
spores.
Spores are released from 
an initially curled structure 
located under the leaf called 
the annulus. The scientists 
observed that the annulus un-
furled itself and released the 
spores in a snapping motion 
that occurred at two different 
speeds. The initial part of the 
snap proceeded very quickly, 
in microseconds, and then 
proceeded to slow down by 
1,000 times to ?ing the spore 
out of the fern.

New iPad sales exceed 3 million units
Within days of the latest 
iPad release, Apple announced 
that 3 million units have al-
ready been sold, in what Philip 
Schiller, senior vice president 
for worldwide marketing, 
called “the strongest iPad 
launch yet.” Apple has sold 10 
times as many iPad 3s on the 
?rst day of sale as those sold at 
the original iPad’s launch. 
The latest version of the 
device has improvements in 
display, wireless connectiv-
ity, and processing power. The 
company has enjoyed similar 
success with other products, 
such as the iPhone 4S, which 
had 1 million units sold within 
24 hours of opening weekend

Many Facebook friends correlates with narcissism   
A new study from West-
ern Illinois University found 
a direct relationship between 
Facebook usage and socially 
disruptive forms of narcissism. 
In the study, researchers ex-
amined the Facebook activi-
ties of 294 users between the 
ages of 18 and 65, who were 
rated for displays of grandi-
ose exhibitionism (GE) and 
entitlement/exploitativeness 
(EE). 
Results found that the 
higher people scored for GE, 
the more friends they had 
on Facebook. The study also 
found that those who scored 
high for both EE and GE were 
more likely to accept friend re-
quests from strangers.

Compounds in sunscreen linked to possible infertility
Researchers from the Na-
tional Institutes of Health 
found that women whose 
bodies had high concentra-
tions of a benzophenone com-
pound were more likely to be 
diagnosed with endometriosis 
than those who had lower con-
centrations. 
Benzophenones are a com-
mon compound in sunscreens 
that have recently been con-
nected to endometriosis, a 
condition where the uterus 
lining grows into other types 
of tissues. This condition often 
results in pain and infertility 
in women, and has long been 
linked to estrogen levels in the 
body. While benzophenones 
have been known to mimic es-
trogen signaling, their connec-
tion to endometriosis was not 
discovered until recently.

Micro?uidic device able to separate unlabeled cells
A recent paper from the 
Korea Advanced Institute of 
Science and Technology re-
vealed the ability to separate 
cell types without additional 
processing of the cells. In typi-
cal magnetic sorting devices, 
cell surfaces must be attached 
with magnetic particles be-
forehand, a process that costs 
both time and money.
In the new micro?uidic 
technique, the labeling pro-
cess was eliminated by incor-
porating cells directly into a 
nontoxic magnetic salt solu-
tion. As the cells ?owed by a 
magnet placed in the device, 
they experienced different 
magnetic forces based on their 
size, and became separated 
based on their mass.

James Cameron to ?lm journey to Mariana Trench
James Cameron, known for 
directing Hollywood block-
busters such as Titanic and 
Avatar, announced a plan to 
?lm his descent to the Mari-
ana Trench. At 10,994 meters 
below the Paci?c, the Mari-
ana Trench is the deepest area 
known on Earth and has not 
been explored in a manned ve-
hicle since a 1960 expedition 
by Jacques Piccard and Don

According to the Pennsyl-
vania law ?rm Edgar Snyder 
and Associates, around 37 
percent of people have sent 
or read a text while driving. 
There were over 5,474 deaths 
attributed to distracted driv-
ing in 2009, and young driv-
ers are the most likely to be 
texting behind the wheel.
On March 8, a Pennsylvania 
law went into effect that pro-
hibits texting of any sort while  
driving.
Before the law was even 
passed, however, research-
ers at Carnegie Mellon had 
probed the effects distracted 
driving has on the brain.
Marcel Just, a senior re-
searcher and professor with 
the Center for Cognitive Brain 
Imaging at Carnegie Mel-
lon, looked at people's brain 
activities while talking and 
driving. Just, along with col-
leagues Timothy Keller and 
Jacquelyn Cynkar, published 
their research in the report “A 
decrease in brain activation 
associated with driving when 
listening to someone speak” 
in the journal Brain Research 
in 2008.
The brain has many differ-
ent parts that work simultane-
ously. “When you’re listening 
to me talk, for instance,” Just 
said, “there are 15 to 20 ar-
eas of your brain being lit up 
that are activated. It’s not one 
place. People say they ‘use 
frontal lobe’ for this. That’s 
really a distortion. There is no 
task that is done by only one 
part, ever.”
While these processing 
regions may seem like the 
most important parts of the 
brain, they only make up a 
relatively small part. Accord-
ing to Just, most of our brain 
is “white matter,” in which a 
fatty material covers a series 
of connectors that act as com-
munication wires among the 
separate regions.
With a viewing screen 
directly above their eyes, 
the subjects in Just's study 
went through a simulation in 
which they “drove” a vehicle 
by moving a hand-held mouse 
that was situated at their 
side. While participants were 
going through their driving 
course, the researchers oc-
casionally asked them true 
or false questions, which the  
subjects would answer by 
pressing a button in their 
other hand. A brain scan de-
termined their brain activity 
by measuring the amount of 
blood ?ow to certain regions 
in the brain.
The results pointed to a 
clear debilitation of driving 
while listening; the brain 
functions that controlled 
driving decreased by 37 per-
cent. The studies showed that 
while people were driving, 
four main regions of the brain 
were active, primarily those 
for vision and spatial relation-
ships. 
When the drivers had to 
respond to questions, how-
ever, new areas of the brain 
associated with language pro-
cessing became active at the 
same time.
Despite the fact that the 
regions are largely separate, 
answering the questions im-
paired the ability to drive, 
and Just thinks it is because 
the white matter — the tissue 
that connects brain areas — 
was heavily taxed.
“I think it’s like plugging in 
an iron and a hairdryer at the 
same time, causing brown-
out,” he said. “There are only 
certain amounts of resources 
to go around, and if you’re try-
ing to draw on too much, each 
demand gets a budget cut. In 
the case of driving, that’s not 
a good thing to be happening 
in some situations.”
To combat distracted driv-
ing, Just and others believe 
that policies regulating cell 
phone use behind the wheel 
are important. The researcher 
himself has created a list of 
ideas, ranging from legisla-
tive mandates to applications 
that shut off one’s phone once 
it reaches a certain velocity. 
But he mainly stresses educa-
tion.
“Nobody really wants to 
get into an accident and no-
body wants to kill an innocent 
pedestrian,” Just said. “I think 
we horribly overestimate our 
cognitive abilities with re-
spect to attention.”
“I think it’s bad,” Just con-
tinued. “I don’t think society 
realizes that it’s bad. It’s not 
muggers doing this; it’s just 
people like you and me and 
our relatives and friends that 
are talking on the cell phone.”
Some Carnegie Mellon 
students, like sophomore art 
major Marie Barcic, agree 
with the new cell phone law. 
“You can’t really afford to be 
distracted while driving,” she 
said. “You can just pull over if 
you need to talk to someone.” 
Others, like sophomore 
chemistry major Abigail Bur-
ton, think more needs to be 
done. “I think it’s a step in 
the right direction, but I think 
there is a long way to go to 
make our roads safe from dis-
tracted driving,” she said.
Education, Just says, will 
make the difference. “If peo-
ple were more aware of how 
detrimental to their driving 
performance cell phone usage 
is, I think many people, just 
out of a sense of responsibil-
ity, would just stop,” he said.

People often complain 
about the inevitable wrinkles, 
body aches, and memory 
loss that accompany old age. 
Many scientists believe that 
DNA and proteins play im-
portant roles in the aging 
process. That’s no exception 
at Carnegie Mellon, where 
researchers are exploring the 
Sirtuin family of proteins, 
hoping to understand how 
this protein could impact ag-
ing. The research has pro-
vided signi?cant insight into 
ways of possibly increasing  
mammalian and human life 
expectancy.
In the past century, life ex-
pectancy has increased signi?-
cantly due to improvements in 
hygiene, drugs, and medical 
technologies. These improve-
ments help the elderly better 
cope with the complications 
that come from old age, many 
of which could be the result of 
one’s DNA and proteins. DNA 
is comprised of genes, which 
act as instructions to make the 
proteins that our bodies use to 
carry out daily functions. As 
humans age, gene expression 
may drop.
Biology graduate student 
Guy Zinman and associate 
professor Ziv Bar-Joseph have 
been working with molecu-
lar biologist Haim Cohen of 
Bar-Ilan University in Israel 
to study genes that code for 
a particular class of proteins 
known as Sirtuin.
Sirtuin proteins have inter-
ested researchers in the past 
decade because of their pos-
sible ties to longevity. Over 
the past few years, projects 
considering Sirutin proteins 
have gained popularity. In Au-
gust 2011, The New York Times 
reported the development of 
a drug involving Sirutin by 
the National Institute of Ag-
ing that helped obese mice 
live longer.
This past month in the 
journal Nature, Cohen and 
his team published their work 
exploring a speci?c Sirtuin 
known as SIRT6 and its im-
pact on longevity in mice.
Back in 2006, Cohen and 
his team were the ?rst to be-
gin their research on SIRT6 
by removing it from the DNA 
in the mice they tested. These 
experimental mice became 
very sick due to various health 
problems and died at very 
young ages. This increased 
the interest in SIRT6, so Co-
hen and his team in Israel 
wondered what would hap-
pen if they increased the con-
centration of SIRT6 in mice.
Zinman explained that “on 
average, the life expectancy 
of these mice increased by al-
most 15 percent.” With these 
results, Cohen and Zinman’s 
group tried to understand 
why these mice were living 
longer than normal mice.
In cells, proteins can in-
duce a chain reaction — the 
production of one protein can 
make the cell produce another 
protein, which then activates 
the production of another 
protein. The group’s research 
concluded that SIRT6 acts in a 
similar manner by activating 
the production of another set 
of proteins. Sirtuin activates 
the production of many other 
proteins that can reduce the 
creation of cholesterol, a fatty 
substance that clogs arteries 
and restricts blood circula-
tion, thus preventing heart 
problems.
It would be a daunting 
task for researchers to exam-
ine the hundred or so proteins 
that are affected by Sirtuin’s 
in?uence. To get around this 
obstacle, Zinman and Bar-
Joseph worked with Cohen’s 
team in Israel using compu-
tational techniques that com-
bined their results with data 
from other projects. From 
this, they produced maps that 
allowed the researchers to un-
derstand the activity of pro-
teins in the cell.
However, Zinman found 
it very dif?cult to navigate 
the 30,000 different projects 
to obtain the information his 
team needed. “It was very un-
clear what types of projects 
developed that data,” he said. 
“Almost half a billion dollars 
worth of data stored online 
was practically unusable.” For 
researchers to successfully an-
alyze a protein’s effects, they 
need to be able to compare 
their data to other data col-
lected around the world.
Faced with this challenge, 
Zinman, Bar-Joseph, and a 
team of computational bi-
ologists at Carnegie Mellon 
attempted to ?nd a way for 
researchers to utilize all this 
information. Together, they 
developed a tool called Ex-
pression Blast that acts as a 
protein data search engine 
for researchers. It allows sci-
entists to input search que-
ries about a protein or gene, 
and retrieve more informa-
tion about it from various  
prior experiments.
“The most impressive as-
pect of Expression Blast is 
that it can compare results 
cross-species, a feature that 
similar tools in the past have 
not been able to do,” Zinman 
explained. This allows the 
tool to play an integral role in 
drug development, since most 
drugs are ?rst developed and 
tested on mice even though 
the eventual target is humans. 
By using Expression Blast, 
“researchers will be able to 
predict if it’s going to work on 
humans,” Zinman said.
With the emergence of 
data on Sirtuin proteins prov-
ing their ties to aging and to 
the development of tools such 
as Expression Blast, scientists 
are now one step closer to de-
termining a concrete way to 
prolong longevity.
“One day we will be able to 
develop drugs that could al-
low humans to live healthier 
lives and possibly enjoy a lon-
ger lifespan,” Zinman said.

The good news is that the 
“Freshman 15” is an exag-
geration; the average weight 
gain among ?rst-years is only 
about 4 1/2 pounds, accord-
ing to a study by Brown Uni-
versity researcher Elizabeth 
Lloyd-Richardson. 
The bad news is that grad-
ual weight gain throughout 
college is becoming a prob-
lem, according to an article 
on CBS.com.
However, a recent study 
shows that a form of therapy 
currently used on diabetes 
patients may be able to pro-
mote weight loss by reducing 
a person’s food intake. The 
study was led by Jenny Tong, 
an assistant professor at the 
University of Cincinnati, and 
Darleen Sandoval, Tong’s re-
search assistant. This therapy 
is used to reduce glucose in 
the bloodstream of diabe-
tes patients and has been 
found to be as effective as 
FDA-approved treatments for 
obesity.
The secret is in the release 
of a hormone known as gluca-
gon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in 
a person’s body whenever he 
or she eats. According to Dr. 
James Norman, parathyroid 
surgeon and founder of the 
medical information website 
EndocrineWeb, GLP-1 is a 
special type of hormone — an 
incretin — that increases the 
amount of insulin in a per-
son’s body. Norman describes 
insulin as a referee for how 
the body uses fat: The insulin 
slows down the burning of fat 
into energy, thereby prolong-
ing the time a person can last 
without eating again.
Tong and Sandoval’s study 
found that by increasing 
the amount of GLP-1 in the 
body, a person’s food intake 
decreases. In a study among 
males of healthy weight, GLP-
1 caused them to reduce their 
food intake by 12 percent 
and feel more satiated than a 
separate group of males who 
were given a placebo.
When asked about the 
possibility of GLP-1 therapy 
being used by Carnegie Mel-
lon students, senior chemical 
engineering and biomedical 
engineering double major 
Jia Jia Zhang said, “I person-
ally wouldn’t do it. Although 
the idea of eating less is ap-
pealing, I don’t think most 
CMU kids eat for the sake 
of eating, but rather to de-
stress.” Zhang added that 
Carnegie Mellon students 
are also smart enough to turn 
down the guinea pig position 
of testing out an experimen-
tal therapy.
Scientists still have much 
to learn about the success of 
GLP-1 in combating obesity 
before it becomes available to 
the public. The weight loss ef-
fects of GLP-1 have only been 
observed in a six-week study 
on patients with Type 2 dia-
betes. Therefore, the results 
cannot be generalized across 
a population of people with-
out diabetes.
The GLP-1 therapy does 
have some known negative 
side effects, the most fre-
quently reported being nau-
sea. Furthermore, the results 
of an internal application of 
GLP-1 via injection have yet 
to be thoroughly analyzed.
If the increase of GLP-1 
content in the body is actu-
ally capable of decreasing 
food intake in patients with-
out diabetes, then the health 
and cosmetic industries may 
have found a gem. With addi-
tional research, the discovery 
of GLP-1 therapy as a weight 
loss method has the potential 
to put over-the-counter diet 
pills out of business. How-
ever, the therapy will not be 
aiding college students any 
time soon.

The spring season brings 
blooming ?owers, pleasant 
breezes, clear skies, and, un-
fortunately, allergies. Just 
thinking of allergies might 
induce mental pictures of 
stuffy noses, watery eyes, and 
sneezing. Usually, people will 
take a variety of medications 
for treating allergies, includ-
ing steroids and allergy shots. 
One of the ?rst medications 
typically given is an antihista-
mine, which works by block-
ing the effects of an immune 
system chemical in our bod-
ies, ?ttingly called histamine.
Histamine is a molecule re-
leased in the immune system 
that leads to symptoms such 
as itching and runny nose. 
In general, when a person’s 
body comes in contact with 
an allergy trigger like pollen 
or ragweed, immune system 
cells called mast cells produce 
histamines. These molecules 
interact with receptors within 
the nose and throat, causing 
common allergy symptoms. 
They can also cause hives to 
form on the skin.
When any part of the body 
comes in contact with an al-
lergy trigger, the body pro-
duces antibodies, which then 
interact with the histamine-
producing mast cells. As a re-
sult, histamines are released 
and bind to special sites called 
receptors on cells in the nose 
and throat. 
This interaction causes 
blood vessels to widen, which 
allows more blood to ?ow to 
the area where the interac-
tion is taking place. It can also 
cause swelling, ?uid leakage, 
and itching in the nose and 
eyes.
Antihistamines block the 
interaction of histamines with 
their receptors in the nose and 
throat, thus suppressing both 
the swelling and the widening 
of blood vessels. 
The medications common-
ly achieve this by coating the 
receptors, preventing them 
from recognizing the hista-
mines.
There are two general 
types of antihistamines. Se-
dating antihistamines can 
enter the brain and cause 
drowsiness. The most recently 
developed antihistamines, 
called non-sedating antihis-
tamines, cannot enter the 
brain and therefore do not 
cause drowsiness. The sedat-
ing antihistamines are more 
commonly used since itching 
tends to worsen in the evening 
and the medicine can help the 
user fall asleep.
Once released by the im-
mune system, histamines 
work very quickly. In fact, ac-
cording to Discovery Health, 
“By the time your symptoms 
appear, the histamine has al-
ready attached to cell recep-
tors, and the allergic reaction 
is well under way. That’s why 
you need to take antihista-
mines two to ?ve hours before 
exposure to allergens.” This is 
because antihistamines gen-
erally work well only 15 to 30 
minutes after they are taken 
and are most effective one to 
two hours after they are con-
sumed.
Although antihistamines 
can be effective in prevent-
ing allergy symptoms, they 
also have a wide array of side 
effects such as drowsiness, 
headaches, blurred vision, 
and constipation. Moreover, 
antihistamines can interact 
with other medications and 
cause further problems, and 
therefore need to be taken 
with caution. 
According to the health 
website NetDoctor.co.uk, 
“Drinking alcohol with a se-
dating antihistamine can 
increase the drowsiness it 
causes and should be avoided. 
Also beware of a ‘hangover’ 
effect in the morning if the 
tablets are taken too late at 
night.”

CMU emergency noti?cations don’t reach everyone
Josh Smith/Forum Editor
A great deal of attention has 
turned to college campus security in 
Pittsburgh over the past month. 
On March 8, tragedy struck the 
University of Pittsburgh’s campus 
when a man opened ?re in the West-
ern Psychiatric Institute and Clinic of 
UPMC, killing one and injuring sev-
en before being killed by University 
of Pittsburgh police. 
Between March 14 and March 
22, three bomb threats occurred 
at the Cathedral of Learning, with 
mandatory evacuations and search-
es concluding each one was a false 
threat. Almost one month ago, Carn-
egie Mellon had a bomb scare, with 
Warner Hall and Smith Hall being 
evacuated.
Our deepest gratitude goes to the 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the 
campus police of Carnegie Mellon 
and Pitt. However, there were prob-
lems with the CMU ALERT Emer-
gency Noti?cation Service (ENS) 
that led to some students not receiv-
ing warnings for some emergencies. 
This problem needs to be ?xed so 
that students are aware of these situ-
ations, especially since many live in 
Oakland.
While some students and faculty 
received an alert by text or voice re-
cording from the CMU ALERT ENS 
after the March 8 shooting, for oth-
ers the only of?cial noti?cation they 
received was an email from President 
Jared Cohon a day later expressing 
his condolences for the victims of the 
shooting and thanking the city and 
campus police. 
For a period of time on March 8, 
the whereabouts and location of the 
shooter were unknown, which led 
the city police to block portions of 
the campus. Central Catholic High 
School on Fifth Avenue was put on a 
lockdown. 
It is a serious issue when students 
who are signed up to receive these 
alerts have no indication that an 
emergency is occurring near where 
they live.
When there are students living 
in Carnegie Mellon housing mere 
blocks away from a potential shooter 
on the run, they should be noti?ed 
of the risks. While a message was 
sent, it was not received by everyone 
signed up for the service. The num-
ber of Carnegie Mellon students who 
reside in Oakland warrants more 
noti?cations for emergencies at Pitt, 
and the technical issues that occur-
ring with the CMU ALERT ENS need 
to be resolved.
Student Senate does not commit to reforming itself
The impeachment process of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Student Body 
President, Jake Flittner, was a failure 
on several levels.
The Undergraduate Student Sen-
ate unanimously called for Flittner’s 
impeachment on March 1. Senate 
Chair Will Weiner and Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA) president 
Jason Imbrogno proceeded to sched-
ule the hearing March 22, on the last 
possible day to impeach Flittner. GSA 
then failed to reach quorum, without 
the 53 members required to vote — 
46 of the 70 members showed — and 
the impeachment hearing was null.
This hearing was meant to be the 
turning point, at which Carnegie 
Mellon’s student government would 
get its act together and start follow-
ing its own rules. Its purpose was to 
show that members of Senate and 
GSA would not stand for those who 
shirk their constitutional duties and 
would set a precedent for the future.
While failing to achieve quorum 
for an impeachment hearing of a stu-
dent government known for his ab-
senteeism is embarrassing, it is not 
the reason why the motion failed. 
The sentiments of the impeachment 
hearing did not match those of the 
movement to impeach, where Stu-
dent Senate unanimously voted to 
proceed with the impeachment hear-
ing against Flittner.
Instead of recognizing that 
Flittner had blatantly left his duties 
unful?lled, excuses were made that 
portrayed the Student Body Consti-
tution as a mere guideline. 
Student Senate did not hold 
Flittner to his constitutional stan-
dards.
The situation shows how Student 
Senate has been unable to follow 
through on initiatives that would 
bene?t the student body. 
Impeaching Flittner would have 
been a signi?cant step toward reach-
ing that goal, simply because student 
government would have followed 
through with an attempt to reform 
itself.
Hopefully in the future, Senate 
will take the necessary measures to 
put student interest ?rst by following 
through with initiatives to remedy 
problems, especially those within 
Senate.
Orange shirt ?rings exhibit unjust Florida legislation
In Florida, you can be legally ?red 
for wearing an orange shirt. Under 
the doctrine of at-will employment, 
it’s possible to be ?red for something 
as arbitrary as wearing a sherbet col-
ored top if your employer deems it a 
worthy reason.
Executives at the Deer?eld Beach 
law ?rm of Elizabeth R. Wellborn, 
P.A., utilized this law when they ?red 
14 employees two weeks ago simply 
for wearing orange shirts. A group 
of employees had been wearing the 
shirts for several Fridays “so they’d 
look like a group when they went 
out for happy hour,” according to the 
Sun Sentinel.
Executives said there had been 
a previous protest involving orange 
shirts. Furthermore, they believed 
that because the employees were all 
wearing orange, the workers must 
have been involved in this vague 
and unde?ned protest and should, of 
course, be ?red. 
This incident demonstrates the 
unnecessary extremity of the law. 
Legislators in Florida, and in every 
state, should reevaluate laws, espe-
cially those along the lines of the at-
will employment laws.
There was no of?ce policy against 
wearing orange shirts. Perhaps the 
executives of the law ?rm were sim-
ply trying to keep a diversity of cloth-
ing from entering the workplace. 
Maybe they saw the orange shirts 
spreading like a plague and decided 
to root it out, before the last boring 
striped tie and sullen face disap-
peared. Possibly, they just don’t like 
happy hour.
We at the Tartan are inclined to 
think they saw this orange-shirted 
trend and decided to grab an op-
portunity to cut a little fat from the 
company. Florida is one of the few 
states that still practices a very ru-
dimentary at-will employment doc-
trine: The state allows an employer 
to discharge his employees “for a 
good reason, for a bad reason or even 
for the wrong reason, as long as it’s 
not an unlawful reason,” according 
to Eric Gabrielle, a Florida labor and 
employment lawyer.
Other states have moved past this 
archaic doctrine by adding various 
exceptions and implied contracts 
that help level the employer-employ-
ee playing ?eld. These exceptions 
protect employees from employer 
retaliation if they were to report 
on illegal company activity or if an 
implied contract’s existence can be 
proven.
Florida has no such protections 
for its employees, and instances such 
as the mystifying mass ?ring of 14 
law ?rm employees are a strong in-
dicator that the state might want to 
rethink things.
Smith illuminates Wall Street’s ?awed culture
JACKSON LANE
If you’re interested at all in the 
affairs of Wall Street, then you’ve 
probably heard about Greg Smith. 
After resigning as vice president for 
Goldman Sachs, Smith published an 
opinion piece in The New York Times 
titled “Why I Am Leaving Goldman 
Sachs,” criticizing the company’s 
culture. Smith’s article points out 
two main ?aws at Goldman Sachs: 
First, that the company is not work-
ing to help its clients but rather to 
make the most money off them; 
second, that it suffers from a culture 
of arrogance and disrespect toward 
clients.
Smith writes that Goldman Sachs 
wasn’t always like this, and, indeed, 
when he joined the ?rm 12 years 
ago, Goldman Sachs had just gone 
through a very momentous change. 
After more than 100 of years as a 
partnership, Goldman Sachs went 
public in 1999. That is when many 
like Smith think the company start-
ed to lose its moral compass.
The initial public offering only 
gave up a small ownership stake to 
traders, but after several more stock 
offerings in the following years, 
the company’s ownership became 
increasingly diluted with pension 
funds, investment management 
companies, and banks. With a few 
exceptions, shareholders like these 
manage many investments and only 
have the time and energy to worry 
about a company’s bottom line. 
In contrast, a private partnership 
might care about more than just 
revenues and may value intangibles 
like preserving a certain company 
culture or staying true to a certain 
ethical or moral code.
Any ?rst-year business student 
can tell you that in a publicly owned 
?rm, an employee’s primary respon-
sibility is to the shareholders — not 
to the customers, not to a boss, and 
not necessarily to any code of ethics. 
In executive positions, employees act 
on the shareholders’ behalf. Since 
shareholders want a better return 
on investment, employees arguably 
have an obligation to do whatever 
it takes to achieve a better bottom 
line, even if that means exploiting 
clients for pro?ts by recommend-
ing that they buy mortgage-backed 
securities while the company itself is 
shorting them.
Obviously, not all publicly traded 
companies are like Goldman Sachs, 
assuming Smith described the bank 
accurately. Southwest, for instance, 
comes to mind as a company with 
a widely admired culture. More-
over, not all private partnerships 
are beacons of morality. But you can 
imagine how in a company as driv-
en, competitive, prestigious, and 
ruthless in bringing home pro?ts as 
Goldman Sachs is, secondary con-
cerns like caring about customers 
could get lost.
The culture of arrogance, how-
ever, may also be an indirect result 
of Goldman Sachs’ going public. 
Although shareholders’ pressure 
did not dictate that clients be re-
ferred to as “muppets,” it’s likely 
that it created an extremely vicious 
and competitive environment. Even 
in his article in Forbes criticizing 
Smith, former Goldman Sachs em-
ployee John Tamny con?rmed this 
up-or-out, eat-what-you-kill culture: 
“Those who don’t produce are let go, 
and to produce they must beat their 
contemporaries at competing invest-
ment banks; many of those competi-
tors eager to beat a Goldman Sachs 
that once neglected to hire them, or 
that once ?red them.”
So, being employed and moving 
up the corporate ladder at Goldman 
Sachs is not just a source of income, 
but also implies that you are the best 
at what you do and “beat” the other 
people in your ?eld, as you would 
in a sport. It’s human nature to feel 
just a little bit arrogant in this type 
of culture. Since clients are merely 
sources of revenue, it’s not hard to 
imagine how you could feel disre-
spectful toward them.
None of this, though, necessar-
ily makes putting pro?ts over cus-
tomers or treating customers with 
disrespect right or even acceptable. 
These are exactly the type of atti-
tudes that sparked movements like 
Occupy Wall Street. 
However, given the fact that lit-
tle has gotten better after the 2008 
?nancial crisis, arguably a conse-
quence of the culture on Wall Street, 
it’s hard to say if and how things 
might change.

Rarely does The Tartan include 
articles about itself. After all, the in-
ternal workings of a newspaper are 
not usually important to the public 
interest. With Meela Dudley’s can-
didacy in this year’s student body 
elections, though, we have a duty to 
inform the public of her actions as 
publisher of The Tartan last year. The 
student body deserves a better vice 
president than someone who failed 
in a senior leadership position.
In December 2010, Meela was 
elected publisher of The Tartan in 
its annual elections. The publisher is 
the chief executive of our organiza-
tion and has duties similar to those of 
a president in other groups. She was 
responsible for keeping ?nances in 
order, supervising our business staff, 
making purchases, interfacing with 
student government and the univer-
sity administration, and exercising 
high-level control over the entire 
organization.
Last October, Meela was im-
peached as publisher, and a majority 
vote of our editorial staff removed 
her from of?ce. The staff took this 
action after several months during 
which Meela’s failure to perform 
her duties had a negative impact 
on both The Tartan’s operation and 
its perception within the university. 
She attended only a handful of the 
weekly business meetings and dis-
played a complete misunderstand-
ing of our ?nancial and advertis-
ing processes even several months 
into her term. Working closely with 
Meela, we found ourselves unable to 
rely on her to pursue her own initia-
tives. Even tasks as routine as pur-
chasing T-shirts or of?ce supplies 
required constant follow-ups and 
postponements.
It is because of our experience 
with Meela that we caution the stu-
dent body against putting her into 
an executive position — in this case 
student body vice president. Her 
tenure at The Tartan was ?lled with 
ideas that were never developed and 
promises that were never ful?lled. 
She did not perform several of her 
constitutional duties. Meela’s tenure 
was, in fact, disappointingly similar 
to the situation that led to the cur-
rent student body president’s im-
peachment proceedings.
Overall, we do not believe that 
Meela is quali?ed to be an effective 
leader of the student body. Although 
The Tartan has moved on from last 
year’s mismanagement, we cannot 
stand by and let Carnegie Mellon’s 
students elect a leader without un-
derstanding her past errors.

Whether you’re a self-proclaimed 
“gleek,” an occasional watcher, or 
only know about it through Face-
book status updates, it’s undeniable 
that the television show Glee has be-
come an important part of modern 
pop culture. As of late, the show has 
been addressing some pretty seri-
ous topics — a big change from the 
campy, all-smiles episodes in the 
earlier seasons. 
The only scandal back then was 
which glee club members were 
cheating on their super?cial rela-
tionship partners. 
But now, for every absurd and 
hilarious insult said by Sue Sylves-
ter, the show’s antagonist whose 
mission is to disband the glee club, 
there’s another scene that leaves 
you shocked at the seriousness of 
the situation.
The show recently documented 
anti-homosexuality bullying, a sui-
cide attempt, a confession of a char-
acter’s previous thoughts of suicide, 
teen marriage, and a car crash in-
volving texting while driving — all 
in one episode. 
Among all these grave issues, 
the singing troupe still managed to 
compete at the always-occurring 
sectionals, which left viewers with a 
confusing mix of emotions through-
out the episode. Glee is becoming 
more of a social commentary than it 
ever has been, but are they overload-
ing? Is this seriousness too much, 
too abruptly?
It seems that the show’s writ-
ers have ?nally realized the power 
they hold in their creation. While I 
respect the show for ?nally address-
ing serious topics, it seems they’re 
throwing in these plot elements just 
to create a stir. 
The characters (and the show) 
become a bit ridiculous if every 
situation ?nds a character having a 
deep-seated emotional experience. 
If the writers were going for realism, 
they’re starting to lose it.
One character, Santana — who’s 
known as a ?irtatious and sexual 
temptress — has come to display 
the powerful emotions of a secret 
same-sex relationship, while keep-
ing her sexual orientation private. 
In a recent episode, she decided to 
come out to her grandmother, who 
disapproved and told her, “Everyone 
has secrets ... they’re called secrets 
for a reason.” 
This tearful interaction came af-
ter the rumor spread through school 
and a guy came up to her claiming 
that he can “straighten her out.” We 
empathize with this character who 
can’t catch a break, but we’re quickly 
encouraged to sympathize with an-
other depressing situation only 10 
minutes later.
However, Glee gets it right with a 
scene where three of the main char-
acters discuss their senior year. With 
the impending approach of gradu-
ation for the main characters, the 
future of the show is constantly up 
for debate. 
When discussing college rejec-
tion letters, the trio talk about how 
college was always just a distant 
event. The effervescent Kurt says 
dramatically, “The future used to 
be such an abstract idea. The dream 
was enough.” 
The show has rarely seen such 
resounding simplicity that is so ef-
fective. Moments like this are when 
Glee shines brightest.
The upcoming graduation may 
have writers trying to cram in as 
many storylines as they can, and un-
intentionally overdoing it. The army 
of outcasts are facing mature and re-
alistic situations, but the overload-
ing is becoming quite a distraction. 
Glee should adopt the notion of less 
is more because when it’s good, it’s 
great.

In response to the article regard-
ing the Armenian Genocide denial 
law, there are a few comments that 
should be made.
First off, there already exists in 
France a law against the Holocaust 
Denial which serves as a direct pre-
cedence for this genocide denial bill 
as France accepts both genocides. 
So the author should argue against 
both the Holocaust denial law and 
Armenian Genocide denial law.
Second, an EU framework was 
established in 2007, in combating 
racism and xenophobia, which said 
as part of that framework, geno-
cide denial should be punished in 
EU member states. So not only was 
France following up on the Holo-
caust denial precedence, but also, 
as an EU member, carrying out this 
framework that applies to it.
Hence, it is uncalled for the writ-
er to characterize France’s passing of 
this law as “overstepping its bound-
aries.” So in reality, no boundary 
was overstepped as the law re?ected 
precedence from a previous geno-
cide denial law and adherence to a 
legal EU framework.

‘Kony’ a milestone in social media
MATT MASTRICOVA
On March 5, the non-pro?t group 
Invisible Children released the video 
“Kony 2012,” which details the bru-
tal war crimes of Joseph Kony, head 
of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), 
including coercing children to be-
come soldiers. Invisible Children 
activists not only raise awareness of 
Kony’s inhumane actions, but also di-
rect military intervention and giving 
aid to the the Ugandan military.
The “Kony 2012” campaign has 
done more than just raise awareness 
about the war criminal Kony. It has 
harkened a new era for social activ-
ism and political awareness — one 
that utilizes the recent surge in social 
media usage. 
In less than a month, it has 
amassed over 84 million views 
thanks to its viral marketing cam-
paign, which gained massive atten-
tion through social media platform 
giants such as Facebook and Tumblr.
This is not the ?rst time that social 
media has helped raise awareness 
of political issues. However, “Kony 
2012” is singular in its widespread 
circulation. It made the rounds on 
sites such as Tumblr, which has a rep-
utation for circulating political inter-
est stories from varying perspectives 
such as the corruption of Hosni 
Mubarak, police brutality during the 
peak of the Occupy movements, and 
the death of Trayvon Martin.
While professional media sources 
presented information on the “Kony 
2012” movement, its exposure was 
greatly assisted by people posting 
links on their pro?les and blogs. One 
of the most notable examples I saw 
was a video by a Ugandan citizen 
giving her opinion on “Kony 2012” 
reblogged thousands of times on 
Tumblr. This unique viewpoint could 
never have been seen so widely be-
fore social media became popular.
In the days after the “Kony 2012” 
video was released, it was impossible 
to look on your Facebook newsfeed 
and not see references to the video. 
While Tumblr is based on the idea 
that you can follow any person or 
organization without personally 
knowing the individual or group, 
Facebook is geared almost exclu-
sively toward social networking with 
people you know.
As such, most posts on Facebook 
are aimed toward disseminating per-
sonal information. While there are 
occasional political debates, they are 
often isolated to one conversation or 
one picture. 
Invisible Children’s campaign 
shattered that notion and has 
opened up an entirely new venue for 
viral, grassroots campaigning.
However, it is dangerous to ig-
nore the pitfalls of a campaign such 
as “Kony 2012.” As benign a cause 
“Kony 2012” may appear to be, it is 
also biased, and some aspects of the 
video are misleading. For example, 
Kony and the LRA have not been 
active in Uganda since 2006, mak-
ing the idea of sending aid to the 
Ugandan government questionable, 
especially given the Ugandan gov-
ernment’s own history of using child 
soldiers.
Regardless of how accurate “Kony 
2012” is, the video’s immediate 
dispersion through Facebook and 
Tumblr has opened a new realm of 
possibilities for grassroots activism. 
It would not be surprising if other 
campaigns in the near future mimic 
the marketing strategy that Invisible 
Children used. 
While this is wonderful in terms 
of spreading information, we cannot 
be content to merely reblog a video 
or buy action kits. 
It is too easy for sincere activism 
to degenerate into something trendy. 
We have to thoroughly research or-
ganizations and the causes that they 
support and remain persistent above 
all.

SPORTS COMMENTARYNL Central Preview: Pirates fourth
CARL GLAZER
Junior Staffwriter
With the 2012 season 
about to begin, it’s time to 
evaluate the MLB’s largest di-
vision: the National League 
Central. Last year, the Mil-
waukee Brewers won the divi-
sion and the St. Louis Cardi-
nals were the National League 
wild card, eventually going on 
to defeat the Texas Rangers in 
the World Series. With both 
teams losing their all-star ?rst 
basemen — Prince Fielder for 
the Brewers and Albert Pujols 
for the Cardinals — the divi-
sion is up for grabs. Let’s look 
at the NL Central in 2012 with 
my predictions for how it will 
?nish.
First place, the St. Louis 
Cardinals
Following their World Se-
ries victory, the Cardinals 
have to cope with the loss of 
their star slugger, Pujols, and 
longtime manager, Tony La 
Russa. However, the Cardinals 
are getting their superstar 
starting pitcher Adam Wain-
wright back — he missed all 
of last season for Tommy John 
elbow surgery — and have 
signed all-star out?elder Car-
los Beltran. 
The Cardinals are also a 
veteran team, so adapting to a 
new manager should not be a 
challenge. The Cardinals have 
a strong lineup now, anchored 
by Matt Holliday, Lance Berk-
man, and great front-end 
starters Chris Carpenter and 
Wainwright. The question is 
how well the Cardinals’ bull-
pen can hold up and how this 
aging team plays in the ?eld.
Second place, 
the Cincinnati Reds
While they were a pick to 
win the division last year, the 
Reds underperformed with 
many of their younger players 
failing to meet expectations. 
This year, they look to pick up 
where they left off in 2010 and 
make a strong playoff push. 
They did not make any big 
splashes in free agency, but 
do have several young pros-
pects — such as catcher Devin 
Mesoraco — that are expected 
to make their major league 
debut sometime in the 2012 
season. 
Their addition of starting 
pitcher Mat Latos by trade 
from the San Diego Padres is 
a nice move as well. The Reds’ 
biggest strengths are their 
pitching rotation, power bats, 
and honorable manager Dusty 
Baker. However, their youth 
and inexperience makes con-
sistency a challenge. 
Third place, the Milwaukee 
Brewers
After winning their divi-
sion last season, the Brew-
ers had a hard off-season, 
losing Fielder to free agency 
and dealing with NL MVP 
Ryan Braun’s performance-
enhancing drug scandal and 
the threat of losing him for 
50 games. Thankfully for the 
Brewers, Braun won his sus-
pension appeal and does not 
have to miss any games, but 
they are still going to struggle 
to replace Fielder both in the 
lineup and on the ?eld. 
They signed third baseman 
Aramis Ramirez to improve 
their defense and to ?ll the 
hole in their lineup. They still 
have a good lineup anchored 
by Braun and shortstop Corey 
Hart, as well as great pitching 
in starter Zack Greinke and 
closer John Axford, but the 
back end of the pitching rota-
tion is very weak, and has had 
trouble staying healthy in the 
past. 
Fourth place, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates
Although they were 
in contention at the all-
star break last year, the 
Pirates ?nished the 
2011 season with their 
19th straight losing 
season. They have a 
lot of young talent and 
have tried to add some vet-
eran help. But bad luck was 
bound to ?nd the Pirates, as 
their newly acquired starting 
pitcher A.J. Burnett will now 
miss serious gametime, hav-
ing broken an orbital bone 
after taking a bunted ball to 
his face. 
Regardless, their success 
will ride on the ability of their 
young talent to reach their 
full potential. If center?elder 
Andrew McCutchen and out-
?elder Garrett Jones can take 
a big step and produce at a 
higher offensive level next 
season, the sky is the limit 
for this young team. Their 
top prospects, catcher Ramon 
Cabrera and pitcher Jameson 
Taillon, could be potentially 
good pieces for the future.
Fifth place, the Chicago 
Cubs
The Cubs have the most 
embarrassing streak in the 
major leagues — no World 
Series wins in 103 years — 
and this year looks to be no 
different. As they add a new 
manager and general man-
ager, this season is de?nitely 
more about rebuilding than 
winning. Shortstop Starlin 
Castro is expected to build on 
the great rookie season he had 
last year, and hopefully turn 
into a legitimate star. 
The Cubs do not have many 
strengths, but the team has a 
few good prospects that may 
make debuts this year, such as 
?rst baseman Anthony Rizzo, 
who has shown a lot of power 
in the minors.  Regardless, the 
Cubs are in for a very long sea-
son with little promise of suc-
cess now or in the near future. 
Sixth place, Houston Astros
As bad as the Cubs may be, 
the Astros are worse. They are 
returning just two starting po-
sition players from their open-
ing day roster last year: Carlos 
Lee, who is moving from left 
?eld to ?rst base, and cen-
ter?elder Jason Bourgeois. 
The Astros do not have 
much in the way of young, 
promising prospects. 
They are moving to the 
American League West after 
this upcoming season to bal-
ance out the two leagues, so 
this is the last season the rest 
of the NL Central can beat 
up on them. Their biggest 
strength is their recent sale to 
new owner Jim Crane. He will 
hopefully care more about 
winning than did their last 
owner and slowly work to turn 
this team around.

The men’s tennis team 
spent its spring break in sun-
ny southern California. The 
Tartans took on Chapman 
University, Bowdoin College, 
Pomona-Pitzer Colleges, and 
University of the South, ?n-
ishing with a 2–2 record.
The Tartans started strong 
by dominating Chapman Uni-
versity 8–1, even with the 
adjustments the men had to 
make to play outdoors. Next, 
the Tartans took on the Bow-
doin Polar Bears. The No. 14 
ranked Polar Bears defeated 
the Tartans 7–2.
The ?rst win came from 
the Tartans’ No. 2 doubles 
team of senior Jeremy King 
and ?rst-year Thomas Coo-
per, winning the pro set in 
a tiebreaker. The other win 
came from ?rst-year Chris-
tian Heaney-Secord at No. 2 
singles, in which he defeated 
his opponent 7–6 (3), 7–5. 
Junior Harsha Rao and ?rst-
year William Duncan had 
closely fought matches at No. 
3 and No. 4 singles, respec-
tively. They were the last two 
Tartans on the court as they 
battled in their third sets.
The men’s team took the 
court the next day against 
No. 12 ranked Pomona-Pitzer 
Colleges and the Tartans fell 
6–3 to the Sagehens. The ?rst 
win came from No. 3 doubles 
team of Heaney-Secord and 
?rst-year Bryce Beisswanger. 
Duncan and King won their 
singles matches at No. 4 and 
No. 5, respectively, to round 
out the Tartans’ victories. 
Carnegie Mellon ?nished 
the California trip with a 9–0 
sweep of University of the 
South.
The biggest win for the 
Tartans occurred this past 
Saturday, when they took on 
No. 5 ranked North Carolina 
Wesleyan. The men took a 
3–0 lead after doubles; they 
had wins at No. 1 doubles 
from tandem of junior Duke 
Miller and Duncan, at No. 2 
doubles from King and Coo-
per, and at No. 3 doubles 
from duo Beisswanger and 
Heaney-Secord.
“We were down double 
match point but were able 
to come back and pull the 
match out. It was a great 
win,” Heaney-Secord said.
The match came down to 
the wire in singles play, with 
only a win from Duncan at 
No. 4 singles. The match 
was tied at 4–4. After losing 
the ?rst set at No. 2 singles, 
Heaney-Secord took the sec-
ond set, which pushed the 
match to a third set. The third 
set was tightly contested, and 
Heaney-Secord prevailed 6–4, 
securing the win for the Tar-
tans. 
“I knew it was on me, and 
I embraced that opporunity. 
I just trusted my shots and 
went big. I was smiling and 
having fun the whole third 
set,” Heaney-Secord said.
The Tartans took on the 
No. 16 ranked University of 
Mary Washington Eagles on 
Sunday and won 5–4. The 
match was delayed, but the 
men took the lead 2–1 after 
doubles play with wins from 
the No. 1 team of Miller and 
Duncan (8–4) and the No. 3 
tandem of Beisswanger and 
Heaney-Secord (8–5). In sin-
gles play, the Tartans had two 
quick wins from Miller at No. 
1 singles and junior Jooho 
Yu at No. 5 singles. Duncan 
clinched the match for Carn-
egie Mellon with a win at No. 
3 singles.
The men’s team will take 
on Washington and Lee Uni-
versity this Saturday at home.

“This is the nicest ?rst day 
of outdoor season we have 
ever had,” said head coach 
Dario Donatelli when the 
men’s track and ?eld team 
gathered for its ?rst prac-
tice this season. Having just 
?nished Indoor University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
with a tie for second place, 
the Tartans were ready to be-
gin outdoors, with the post-
spring break weather in their 
favor.
The men’s track and ?eld 
team traveled south to Lex-
ington, Va. for its ?rst meet of 
the outdoor season this past 
weekend at the VMI-W&L 
Track and Field Carnival, 
hosted annually by Washing-
ton and Lee University. There, 
they were again greeted by 
warm weather and pleasant 
competition conditions for 
nearly the entire duration of 
the two-day meet. 
Working as a team, sopho-
more Mike Standish, junior 
Benjamin Nealy, ?rst-year 
Thomas Vandenberg, and ju-
nior Noel Titus ran the 4x400 
meter relay race on Friday, 
?nishing strong in fourth 
place with a time of 3:21.85. 
Vandenberg also competed in 
the 800-meter run the next 
day, ?nishing with a time of 
1:58.33. Sophomore Joshua 
Newby came in second over-
all in the 5,000-meter run in 
15:03.89. 
In the ?eld events, many 
Carnegie Mellon athletes 
made strong marks. Sopho-
more Nathan Cheek placed 
seventh in the shot put, 
throwing 13.36 meters. 
Sophomore Zachary Erra-
Hernandez threw the shot put 
a distance of 14.92 meters, 
earning an overall ?rst place 
title in the event. He also 
placed sixth in the discus, as 
well as eighth in the hammer 
throw.
“I’m hoping to build off 
of all the practices, as well 
as from the indoor season, to 
get better each time during 
outdoors,” Erra-Hernandez 
said.
In the pole vault, junior 
Daniel Cardenas Rivero ?n-
ished second after clearing 
a height of 4.10 meters, his 
career best. Competing in 
his ?rst outdoor season, ?rst-
year Michael McDermott 
placed sixth in the pole vault, 
as well as third overall in the 
high jump with a height of 
1.90 meters. Senior Ryan Kis-
sell placed sixth in the long 
jump with a distance of 6.56 
meters. He also came in third 
in the triple jump, clearing 
12.94 meters. 
The men’s track and ?eld 
team will continue to utilize 
the rare good weather for 
practice. They will be com-
peting this Friday and Satur-
day at Washington and Jef-
ferson University.

Two weeks of Carnegie Mellon 
golf have passed and now the Tar-
tans have two tournaments under 
their belt. The University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Champion-
ships were held March 13–14 at 
the 72-par Red Tail Golf Course in 
Sorrento, Fla. 
The Tartans placed third at 
this event, scoring 308 in the ?rst 
round and 310 in the last for a to-
tal score of 618. Emory University 
took ?rst scoring at 581, Univer-
sity of Rochester ?nished second 
with a score of 586, and New York 
University took fourth by scoring 
637.
Sophomore Grant Strimel and 
senior Terence Einhorn tied for 
10th in the tournament with 36-
hole scores of 153. Strimel’s sec-
ond round was seven strokes bet-
ter than his ?rst. 
Both Strimel and Einhorn 
earned All-UAA second team 
honors. This is the third-
straight season Einhorn has 
been honored with All-
UAA: As a sophomore, 
Einhorn achieved ?rst-
team honors.
“I really worked 
hard on my swing 
in the offseason 
and was ready to 
hit shots when I got 
down [to the Red 
Tail Golf Course]. 
I had control over 
the ball, but my putter was just ice 
cold until the ?nal day,” Einhorn 
said.
Senior Michael Cheng ?nished 
at 155 with scores of 77 and 78. 
Sophomore Ian Bangor scored 79 
on both days to ?nish with a score 
of 158.
First-year Justin Fischler ended 
his play with a score of 161.
“We only had a few practice 
rounds to make sure that every-
thing we worked on during the 
winter transferred over to the actu-
al course. With a little more time, 
I think we would have played bet-
ter,” said sophomore Matt Wilson.
The Tartans competed in the 
2012 Jekyll Island Invitational 
from March 16–18. In the three-
day, 54-hole event, the Tartans ?n-
ished 26th out of 30 with a team 
score of 938 (304, 326, 308). 
Einhorn ?nished the tourna-
ment with a score of 226, shoot-
ing his best round on the third day 
with a score of 72. 
Cheng shot 230, and Bangor 
?nished at 240. Strimel had a set-
back with a score of 250 in this 
tournament, and ?rst-year Derek 
Cobb scored the same. 
“We did not play our best in 
both tournaments, but we showed 
signs of potential heading into 
our next couple of tournaments,” 
Cheng said. “We had some good 
rounds shot by our team.”

Over spring break, the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s 
tennis team played in three 
competitions, defeating three 
straight-ranked opponents 
before falling to the defend-
ing Division-III champions 
last week.
The team started its West 
Coast road trip by defeating 
Chapman University 9–0.
The duo of seniors Laura 
Chen and Courtney Chin 
pulled out a victory 9–7, while 
?rst-years Bryn Raschke and 
Angela Pratt, and sophomore 
Katie Cecil and ?rst-year 
Chelsea Motie won 8–3 and 
8–1, respectively.
The Tartans also domi-
nated singles with Chen, 
Motie, Cecil, Pratt, ?rst-year 
Clare DuBrin, and senior Cze-
Ja Tam losing only two sets 
among their six matches. 
The next opponent on 
their trip was Pomona-Pitzer 
Colleges. The Tartans faced 
strong competition from the 
No. 9 team in the nation, 
but pulled out a win of 7–2. 
Chen and Chin, along with 
Cecil and Motie, both pulled 
out doubles victories while 
Pratt and Raschke struggled 
to keep up with the tougher 
competition.
In singles, the women’s 
team again came out strong 
as Chen, Cecil, Chin, Pratt, 
and DuBrin were victorious 
in their matches; Cecil, Chin, 
and Pratt won in straight sets. 
Motie put up a resilient battle 
pulling even after two sets; 
however, she dropped the 
third. The Tartans ended their 
road trip by sweeping the Uni-
versity of the South 9–0. Chen 
and Chin, Raschke and Mo-
tie, and Cecil and Pratt won 
doubles. 
In singles, the team 
stepped up its game with 
Chen only needing more than 
two sets to seal her victory. 
Cecil, Motie, Chin, and Pratt 
all ?nished their matches 
quickly. Tam was particularly 
dominant, defeating her op-
ponent without losing a single 
game.
Returning home, the Tar-
tans took on the four-time Di-
vision-III champions and cur-
rent No. 1 overall, Williams 
College. The Tartans’ winning 
streak ended here with a loss 
of 6–3.
The tandem of Motie and 
Raschke won their match 8–6 
while Cecil and Pratt won 
with 9–8, coming from be-
hind to seal their victory.
The Tartans’ previously 
dominating singles took a 
step back this game, with only 
Cecil pulling out a victory.
After the long, four-game 
stretch, the Tartans took on 
the University of Mary Wash-
ington Eagles on Sunday and 
had an 8–1 win.
The Tartans swept dou-
bles, with wins from the No. 
1 team of Chen and Chin, No. 
2 team of Cecil and Pratt, and 
No. 3 team of DuBrin and Ra-
schke. Carnegie Mellon con-
tinued on to win ?ve out of its 
six singles matches.
“It was fantastic, baby! The 
team spirit was really strong 
today, and everyone was very 
focused starting from the 
warm-up and worked to take 
care of business,” Cecil said.
The women will play 
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty this Saturday at home. The 
match start time is still to be 
announced.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
club lacrosse team played two 
games last week. The ?rst 
was against the John Carroll 
University Blue Streaks in 
University Heights, Ohio. The 
Tartans fell in this game with 
a close score of 9–8.
This game was tightly con-
tested with strong defensive 
efforts from both teams. The 
Tartans’ junior goalie Spencer 
Rice posted an impressive 47.1 
save percentage, but his num-
ber was bested by the Blue 
Streaks’ goalie’s save percent-
age of 61.9 percent. Sopho-
more mid?elder Spencer Lehr 
led the Tartans’ offense with 
four goals.
The team also competed 
against the Walsh Univer-
sity Cavaliers last Saturday at 
Gesling Stadium. The closely 
fought match ended with a 
Tartan defeat, losing with a 
score of 20–15. The Tartans 
are now 1–4 overall, 0–3 in 
conference.
The Tartans’ lacrosse team 
lacked defense in this match, 
giving up 20 goals. Prior to 
the game against Walsh Uni-
versity, their season high for 
goals allowed was 13. The 
game raised their season av-
erage of goals against from 
eight to 10.4.
Carnegie Mellon’s offense 
was strong throughout the 
match. Although they lost, 
the Tartans put 15 past the 
Cavaliers’ goalie, matching 
their season high. This of-
fensive frenzy contrasts the 
strong defensive game earlier 
in the week.
“We played well. We were 
up against a solid team with 
a very strong offense,” said 
junior mid?elder Jimmy Ko-
mianos, who scored one goal 
on Saturday. “For our upcom-
ing road trip, we can improve 
on keeping the game speed up 
throughout the entire game, 
as we got a bit complacent in 
the second quarter and we fell 
behind.”
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s club lacrosse team is 
led by head coach Andrew 
Dickson, who has been in 
the position since 2007. The 
team’s assistant coach is 
Robert Heaps. As part of the 
Central Collegiate Lacrosse 
Association, the club lacrosse 
team plays under the Men’s 
Collegiate Lacrosse Associa-
tion (MCLA) subdivision. All 
the rules of the MCLA are in 
line with those set forth by 
the NCAA. The team practices 
once or twice a week on either 
the soccer ?eld or at Gesling 
Stadium.
The Tartans will be back 
on the ?eld this Friday against 
the U.S. Coast Guard Acade-
my (4–3, 1–1) in Connecticut. 
This game will be the ?rst of 
a ?ve-game road trip before 
the Tartans return home for 
their ?nal game of the season 
against the University of Pitts-
burgh Panthers.

Sex talk entertains students
Attendees give standing O-vation for educational program
“I <3 FEMALE ORGASM” was prominently displayed 
on several students’ T-shirts last week. These 
T-shirts were not solely intended to be provocative or 
racy, but were also a walking advertisement for the 
much anticipated “I <3 Female Orgasm” program. 
Presented by Ms. CMU — a newly formed student 
organization focused on women’s rights — and the 
Peer Health Advocates, the presentation featured 
sex educators Rachel Dart and Marshall Miller, 
who talked about every Carnegie Mellon student’s 
primary concern: the female orgasm.
The lecture in Doherty Hall was completely packed 
last Thursday, with students sitting in the aisles and 
on the floor in front of the first row. The speakers 
started off the program by showing the famous “I’ll 
have what she’s having” scene from When Harry Met 
Sally. Students were roaring with laughter, which 
was exactly Dart and Miller’s intention, as they said 
the topic of female orgasm should be something fun 
to talk about — not something serious or awkward.
The presentation was interactive: The speakers 
invited audience members to share what they 
already knew about the female orgasm. Dart and 
Miller would then address each piece of knowledge 
by either clarifying it as a myth or expanding upon 
it. This flexibility gave the presentation a natural 
flow that was more comfortable than if the speakers 
lectured straight to the audience. Miller was 
particularly hilarious, comparing poor sex education 
in high schools to a driver’s education class that only 
teaches you how to put on your seat belt and not 
actually how to drive the car.
Mainly females attended the presentation, but there 
was a good number of males present. One of the 
male attendees, Nick Zuniga, a sophomore biology 
and psychology double major, said that he attended 
because he “just wanted to find out more about 
how the female body works ... how to better help my 
girlfriend.”
The publicity for the event made sure to stress 
that this was a program for all genders and sexual 
orientations. The speakers did a good job of 
addressing the topic from multiple perspectives; the 
program never seemed like it was focused solely on 
heterosexual relationships and intercourse. Dart and 
Miller also addressed more serious concerns such 
as sexual abuse, providing resources available to 
students who may be affected by such issues.
About halfway through the program, the audience 
was divided up by gender and sexual orientation: 
Females stayed in the hall while males moved to 
another room with Miller, and a small group of those 
who did not want to be sorted by gender went to 
another room. Once isolated from the males, the 
females felt more comfortable openly discussing 
topics such as masturbation and its stigma, first 
orgasms, and how to better achieve orgasm. The 
format was an open forum, with audience members 
raising their hands and sharing their stories in a 
confidential, nonjudgmental environment.
The entire audience then reconvened in the original 
lecture hall, where the speakers finished their 
presentation by further discussing the female body 
and answering questions along the way. At one 
point, audience member Anya Weitzman, a senior 
Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in art 
and anthropology, offered to clarify the answer to a 
question a male student asked regarding the clitoris, 
citing her Body Politics class as the source of her 
knowledge.
The audience was enthusiastic about the 
presentation and discussion. At the end of the 
program, students rose and gave the speakers a 
standing ovation for an entertaining and informative 
session.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
My one friend “Jen” really 
hates my other friend 
“Steve.” However, Steve 
thinks they’re both really 
good friends, and I just 
don’t have the heart to 
tell him. What can I do to 
defuse the situation?
Thanks,
Fraternal Relationship 
Isn’t Exactly Non-
Existent; Malevolence Is 
Entertained Singly
Dear FRIENEMIES,
There are two options here: 
Either Jen legitimately hates 
Steve, or she wants to tutti 
frutti his sweet booty.
If she hates him, then there’s 
not much you can do. 
You should just tell Steve 
what’s going on. Otherwise 
they’ll just keep running into 
each other, and he’ll keep 
ruining her day. If he knows, 
then he’ll at least have the 
decency to avoid her. Or he’ll 
just keep hanging around 
her out of spite. If it were 
me, I’d go the spite route. 
Luckily, everyone loves me. 
Right? RIGHT?
Right. On the other hand, 
she may just find herself 
irresistibly attracted to him 
and not know how to deal 
with it. In that case, you 
should just step aside and let 
nature take its course. And 
by “nature,” I mean alcohol. 
At some point, they’ll both 
get drunk and hash out 
those feelings. And by “hash 
out those feelings,” I mean 
my editor won’t let me say 
what they’d actually do.
Or she’ll just slap him,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
My friend’s throwing a 
birthday party with jello 
wrestling. I feel like it’s 
a terrible idea, but he’s 
insisting on doing it, and 
has already bought a 
kiddy pool, tarp, and a 
few gallons of off-brand 
jello. What can I do to 
keep this from being a 
disaster?
Thanks,
Want Really Entertaining 
Story, Though Leery of 
Existing Revelry
Dear WRESTLER,
Judging by that purchase 
history, your friend is already 
on an FBI watch list for 
creepy serial killers. So as 
long as a bunch of federal 
agents don’t bust the party, 
it’ll be a relative success. 
Really, there’s only one thing 
you can do in this situation. 
At some point, you’re just 
going to have to down a few 
drinks, hop in that tub, and 
take on all comers. Sure, 
your friend probably wants 
girls in bikinis in there, but he 
might just have to settle for 
a drunk guy in a Hawaiian 
T-shirt. 
Or instead of taking that 
terrible advice, go to your 
friend’s house early and 
just eat all of the jello 
beforehand. That’s the only 
way to salvage everything. 
Grab a spoon, and jump on 
that jello grenade.
Or maybe there will 
actually be some slutty 
girls there,
Patrick Hoskins

“Carnegie Mellon University’s largest student-run 
fundraising event,” boasted the program for Greek 
Sing 2012. With over 1,000 participants from the Greek 
community representing 17 different chapters, the 
event managed to raise over $55,000 for The Children’s 
Institute of Pittsburgh. The philanthropy award, given to 
the house that raised the most money on its own, was 
awarded to Delta Gamma for raising over $8,000.
The Greek Sing chairs — Jake Yosafat, a senior business 
administration and ethics, history, and public policy 
double major in Alpha Pi Epsilon, and Harold Kim, 
a senior information systems and human-computer 
interaction double major in Sigma Alpha Epsilon — also 
served as the masters of ceremonies for the evening’s 
festivities. Both have served as the Greek Sing chairs of 
their individual houses, and Yosafat saw the opportunity 
as “one last ?nal way to give back to the Greek 
community,” with Kim echoing his sentiments.
Yosafat and Kim aided in moving the show along with 
witty banter between performances that kept the 
audience laughing. Laughter was a big part of the show 
as a whole: Most groups used slapstick and lowbrow 
humor, which the audience responded well to. The ?rst 
competitive performance, Beta Theta Pi, embodied this 
spirit and took the time to make fun of itself, showcasing 
the good-hearted spirit of the event and reminding 
audience members that the show is about giving back 
to the community. Similar to Beta Theta Pi’s seven-foot 
man in drag, Delta Delta Delta and Lambda Phi Epsilon 
had a cast member don an afro larger than his head that 
covered his entire face. This exaggerated humor was a 
big theme, and helped keep the entire event engaging.
The event had eight judges, all professionals chosen 
from the Carnegie Mellon community, including 
housefellows, professors, and program directors. 
Although the audience had no interaction with the 
judges, a description of each judge was included in the 
program along with fun facts such as computer science 
professor David Kosbie’s “near-perfect lack of pitch.”
The competition was broken into two acts: singles 
performances and doubles performances. After over 
two hours of competition and a video on The Children’s 
Institute of Pittsburgh, the scores were ?nally tallied. 
Kim and Yosafat awarded two Chairmen’s Choice 
Awards, an award for the houses they deemed the 
easiest to work with and that helped the event run 
smoothly. This year’s recipients were Delta Delta Delta 
and Kappa Kappa Gamma.
After much anticipation, awards were presented 
starting with singles third-place winner Alpha Kappa 
Delta Phi. The members of Alpha Kappa Delta Phi 
competed in the event for the ?rst time this year and 
performed their own rendition of Disney’s Tangled. In 
second place for singles competition was Pi Delta Psi 
for its unique twist on Willy Wonka and The Chocolate 
Factory. In the group’s version of the show, Willy Wonka 
turns out to be Michael Jackson in disguise, thus 
explaining why three boys were lured to a land of candy 
and magic without the accompaniment of their parents.
The singles winner was Alpha Epsilon Pi, whose 
members performed Death of a Salesman. Managing 
to keep the plot of their show a secret until the 
performance, their show chronicled the death of a very 
well-known salesman of our day: Billy Mays. Beginning 
with his early days selling lemonade and continuing up 
to a clever scene in which he literally and ?guratively 
“fell off the wagon,” the show was a pleasant surprise for 
audience members expecting a more traditional Death 
of a Salesman.
Doubles winners were some of the the most anticipated 
awards of the night. This year’s third place winners 
were Delta Gamma and Delta Tau Delta with their take 
on Tarzan. Second place went to Kappa Alpha Theta 
and Sigma Phi Epsilon performing Across the Universe. 
Vocal talents reigned in their performance, and the leads 
and soloists blended well once the show was under 
way. Both groups utilized the size of their ensembles 
and performed large group numbers with dif?cult 
choreography.
This year’s doubles winners were Alpha Chi Omega and 
Sigma Chi, whose members performed Footloose. The 
show included innovative rotating set pieces, as well as 
a lot of musical and dancing variety from one number to 
the next. The men of Sigma Chi performed a number in 
the show with no musical accompaniment that seemed 
to wow the audience. Despite the time constraint, the 
group managed to include a variety of set pieces, dance 
moves, and singing styles.
The night began and ended with non-competitive 
performances from sororities Kappa Phi Lambda and 
Alpha Kappa Alpha. Each group of women performed 
routines focused on stepping. Yosafat and Kim explained 
that more than 20 different organizations were involved 
in the night’s performances including the Greek 
houses, media outlets, the alumni association, and staff 
from all over campus. Such widespread involvement 
is indicative of the spirit of the event, and, together, 
everyone’s hard work managed to generate over $50,000 
for a great cause.

On dancing
When simpli?ed to the most basic interpretation, people 
dance for two reasons: for a love of movement and for a 
love of sex. These two motivations dominate any dance 
?oor and are in a constant state of con?ict. Unfortunately, 
it appears that far too many individuals simply see dancing 
as an opportunity to attract one another.
Imagine yourself at a dance party. Do you know what the 
DJ is playing? The thumping sounds emitting from the 
speakers aren’t playing Rihanna and Calvin Harris’ “We 
Found Love” or even the latest Skrillex jam. Despite this, 
some people are dancing the night away without a care in 
world. At the same time, a girl in stiletto heels and wearing 
far too much makeup walks up to the DJ and asks for 
something people can dance to.
Why is only half of the crowd dancing? Perhaps only 
half of the crowd is dancing for the right reason. Those 
who dance out of a love of movement do not care about 
the artist being played, but rather they care about the 
experience and the atmosphere the DJ is creating. As long 
as the DJ can create ?uid transitions, this crowd could 
care less what genre of music they are listening to.
On the other hand, those who dance to attract others 
tend to only dance to music they have heard before. The 
ability to recognize the song is essential, as this dictates 
the “appropriate” style of dance. These types of dancers 
are more interested in who is looking at them. This over-
sexualized form of dancing is ruining the concept of the 
in?nite beat. When a love of movement is removed from 
the equation, the idea of dancing until sunrise or dancing in 
the middle of the day seems absurd.
Next time you ?nd yourself listening to music you are 
unfamiliar with, think about how this music can compel 
your body to move. If you do this, I promise you’ll have a 
better time, and you might even attract something better 
than a one-night stand.

ToonSeum exhibit depicts New York
Will Eisner’s New York reveals humanist portrait of great city
As odd as it may seem, Pittsburghers can ?nd a 
slice of the Big Apple in the heart of downtown 
Pittsburgh until May 27.
This is because the ToonSeum, Pittsburgh’s 
museum of cartoon and comics art, is currently 
presenting Will Eisner’s New York, a rare collection 
of original works by legendary comics pioneer 
Will Eisner. The exhibit chronicles the artist’s 
informal history of the city that shaped many of his 
illustrated masterpieces. Simultaneously personal 
and universal, Eisner’s depiction of New York City 
captures the nuance that the greatest of biographers 
are capable of.
The exhibition is curated by cartoonist and critic 
Denis Kitchen along with comic book writer 
and editor Danny Fingeroth; it is presented in 
partnership with the Museum of Comic and Cartoon 
Art in New York (MoCCA). MoCCA had originally 
organized the exhibit in 2005, soon after Eisner 
passed away at the age of 88. The ToonSeum’s 
display of Will Eisner’s New York is the ?rst time that 
this particular collection of work has been shown 
outside of New York City.
Considered one of the most important contributors 
to the development of the artistic medium of comics, 
Eisner was best known for his leading role in 
establishing the graphic novel as a form of literature 
with his book A Contract with God, and Other 
Tenement Stories. In this work and the subsequent 
works he created during the ’80s and ’90s, Eisner 
explored the communicative depths of the medium 
and laid down a framework for generations of 
aspiring cartoonists.
Will Eisner’s New York allows audiences to explore 
the artist’s most intriguing element, the ever-
changing landscape of New York City. The exhibit 
includes over 50 original works spanning Eisner’s 
70-year career, each capturing a glimpse of the city’s 
beauty and squalor. Dense but not overwhelming, 
the exhibit allows visitors to fully experience the city 
from pre-Depression to modernity. From immigrant 
ghettos to claustrophobic subways, dirty alleyways 
to towering rooftops, ramshackle tenements to 
grandiose bridges, Will Eisner’s New York reveals 
the artist’s powers of observation and empathy and, 
above all, the brilliance of his pen.
An exhibit like this makes it possible for visitors to 
lean forward and peer at the original drawings and, 
in so doing, increase their appreciation of Eisner’s 
art. Getting close to the original drawings, and to 
such a broad array of them, reinforces the notion of 
Eisner as a master of this 20th-century art form.
The ToonSeum’s main gallery houses the exhibition 
and displays it in a concentrated yet uncluttered 
fashion. A lively jazz soundtrack with pieces by the 
likes of Duke Ellington, Cannonball Adderley, and 
Cab Calloway accompanies the exhibit and adds the 
energy of New York to the halls of the ToonSeum.
Small details in the exhibit like a light post, a ?re 
hydrant, and a manhole cover make for nice touches 
that embellish the exhibition. These details invite 
visitors to experience the work viscerally, on their 
own terms, and to develop their own relationship 
with the master’s work and with the city of New 
York.
Juan Fernandez | Staffwriter
Will Eisner’s New York will be on display through 
May 27 in the ToonSeum’s main gallery. The 
ToonSeum is located in downtown Pittsburgh’s 
Cultural District at 945 Liberty Ave.

Find your niche in Pittsburgh’s biking community
Learn about biking safety, security basics, and local organizations from Carnegie Mellon students
Pittsburgh is not known for particularly good weather or 
road conditions, but somehow there is still a large biking 
community. Predominantly among college students, 
biking seems to be a favorite mode of transportation, 
perhaps because of the price of gas, the dif?culty of 
parking on campus, and the impending bus service cuts. 
Biking is an ideal way to get around the city — as long 
as you can deal with intense potholes and a few massive 
hills.
Biking habits vary greatly from person to person, so it’s 
all about knowing your options and ?nding what works 
for you. It’s no secret that biking is great for your health 
and for the environment. It’s good exercise, helps reduce 
stress, allows you freedom to explore, and helps energy 
ef?ciency. For experienced cyclists, biking in Pittsburgh 
may be no big deal, but if you are new to biking in the 
city — or are still just considering it as an option — there 
are some basic things you should be aware of before you 
hit the streets.
17% of survey respondents do not use any type 
of lock on their bikes.
73% of survey respondents have not had 
any security problems, while 11% of survey 
respondents have had their bikes stolen.
Bike Safety
As a cyclist in Pittsburgh, you have to be aware of a 
variety of safety hazards, including poor road conditions, 
lack of bike lanes, other motorists, and pedestrians. In 
a survey of 106 Carnegie Mellon students who bike, 
the majority said they feel moderately safe while biking 
in Pittsburgh, but a signi?cant portion feel moderately 
unsafe. Being aware of your surroundings and ?nding 
a route that works for your comfort level is the most 
important factor for safe biking in and around the city.
Biking on the sidewalk is a good way to gain con?dence 
as a new biker. In fact, 31 percent of survey respondents 
said that they bike primarily on the sidewalk. Riding 
on the road requires you to be more alert to your 
surroundings, since other motorists, like cars and buses, 
are more unpredictable than pedestrians and often don’t 
communicate their actions with appropriate turn signals.
To stay aware of your surroundings, you should pay 
attention not only to what you see around you, but also 
to what you hear. It’s important to know who is behind 
you, and, since constantly turning your head to check 
can be dangerous, listening carefully is a good way to 
keep track of your surroundings.
61% of respondents wear a 
helmet at least sometimes 
while biking (39% wear one 
always).
69% of respondents bike 
primarily on the road.
Pittsburgh Organizations
Pittsburgh is home to a large bicycling community. The 
two most well-known cycling organizations in the city are 
BikePGH and Free Ride.
BikePGH’s mission is “to establish Pittsburgh as a city 
that is increasingly safe, accessible, and friendly to 
bicycle transportation.” Focusing on bike advocacy — 
increasing the number of bike lanes, adding shared-lane 
markings to roads that are too narrow for bike lanes, and 
organizing events like Bike to Work Week and BikeFest 
— and maintaining up-to-date bike maps, BikePGH has 
been working on improving biking conditions in the city 
since 2002.
Free Ride is a DIY recycled bike collective and 
educational facility located at Construction Junction (214 
N. Lexington St.). Free Ride is “dedicated to recycling 
bicycles, offering mechanical education, and promoting 
bicycling.” The facility is open as a repair shop and also 
hosts a number of adult classes, youth programs, and 
volunteer nights. As a shop, all bicycle parts are free of 
charge — all that is required in exchange is volunteer 
hours at the shop.
Bike Trails
Now that the weather is nice, spending an afternoon 
biking around doesn’t sound so bad. Pittsburgh has a lot 
of bike trails along the rivers that are useful for ef?cient 
transportation around Pittsburgh and feature beautiful 
views of the city.
The Eliza Furnace Trail follows the Monongahelia River 
for four miles around Downtown. The trail is ideal for 
beginner bikers. The Panther Hollow Trail runs along the 
west side of Schenley Park, down to the Monongahela 
River. The trail is short — just 1.5 miles — but it connects 
Oakland and the Carnegie Mellon campus to the Eliza 
Furnace Trail, so those looking for a longer ride are in 
luck.
If you’re up for an adventure, the Great Allegheny 
Passage is the trail for you. Connecting Cumberland, 
Md., to Pittsburgh, the Great Allegheny Passage boasts 
beautiful views of western Pennsylvania and is a useful 
connector for serious bikers.
For more information on bike trails in Pittsburgh, 
BikePGH has a comprehensive map of bike trails on its 
website bike-pgh.org.

Bike Security
Carnegie Mellon has lots of bike racks around campus, 
so locking up your bike is convenient no matter where 
you are. The university is striving towards making 
campus even more bike-friendly: The Undergraduate 
Student Senate has formed a committee to address 
campus biking issues and is working to install more bike 
racks around campus.
Using bike racks properly is extremely important. Bike 
parts are valuable and thefts are common. In the survey, 
over 80 percent lock up their bikes using a U-lock, cable 
lock, or chain lock.
Organizations like Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) have been 
working to increase the number of bike racks in the city 
to make Pittsburgh more bike friendly. When parking 
your bike off campus, lock 
it up on one of these bike 
racks or in a highly visible 
and well-lit area to avoid 
security issues.

pillbox 03.26.127
After more than a year of a viral promotional campaign, 
The Hunger Games was released in domestic theaters 
this past weekend. Based on the popular young adult 
book series of the same name, the movie opened with 
rave reviews from critics and set a record for highest 
grossing revenue of any non-sequel ?lm and the ?fth 
highest revenue for opening day.
While recent movie adaptations of a book series aimed 
at a young adult audience have been mostly lackluster 
(The Golden Compass, Twilight, and Percy Jackson and 
the Olympians come to mind), The Hunger Games is 
not only a faithful adaptation, but conveys the story in a 
more ?uid, enjoyable manner than the book does.
The Hunger Games revolves around Katniss — who 
lives in the dystopian country Panem that is divided into 
12 districts and a capitol state — and her experience 
as a competitor in the Hunger Games. The games are 
a sporting event in which one girl and one boy, called 
tributes, are chosen from each district to compete in a 
battle royale to the death.
The biggest change from page to screen was the 
narrative shift. While the book was told from a ?rst-
person perspective, the movie embraces a broader 
narrative, extending beyond Katniss to the minor 
characters. The effect is brilliant. While the huge amount 
of expository dialogue Katniss unloads to the reader 
serves its purpose in the novel, excessive cutaway 
scenes and an overuse of voiceover would have killed 
the pacing of the movie, which remained tense and 
quick throughout.
The broader narrative also allowed the movie to explore 
other characters’ perspectives, which signi?cantly 
added to the experience. Most notable were the scenes 
in which the audience views the Gamemakers, who 
design and control the event, creating changes within 
the game. These changes included coercing tributes 
to move in certain directions and altering the weather. 
The movie also included scenes in which President 
Coriolanus Snow interacts with Head Gamemaker 
Seneca Crane, which lend a deeper understanding of the 
politics of the Hunger Games.
Despite these changes, it was the sound and visuals 
that stood out most in the movie. While the book relied 
completely on Katniss’ narrative to create tension, 
the movie utilized sound. The score was sparse and 
mainly used for expository scenes and during the 
conclusion. The games themselves were largely without 
accompanying background music, as were scenes such 
as Katniss’ of?cial interview. This resulted in an uneasy 
atmosphere that was only compounded by the camera 
work, which utilized quick perspective changes and 
occasional “shaky-cam.”
Of course, the movie was not without fault. To be fair, 
this mostly stemmed from the necessary changes in 
narrative. Much of the information that Katniss reveals 
in the book, such as historical information on Panem 
and her own thoughts, is left out. In some cases — such 
as her relationship with Peeta, the other tribute from 
her district — this ambiguity is a surprisingly welcome 
change. But this largely results in characters feeling 
less ?eshed out, to the point where some characters are 
nameless throughout the ?lm.
While reading The Hunger Games, it is hard not 
to imagine it as a ?lm, considering the archetypal 
characters and the gripping narrative. The movie 
lives up to this expectation and, in some ways, even 
surpasses it.

The Miller Gallery is currently featuring the work of 
seven Carnegie Mellon Master of Fine Arts students in 
the exhibition The You Inside of Me. After three years 
of study at the School of Art, the artists — Jonathan 
Armistead, Agnes Bolt, Sung Rok Choi, Jesse England, 
Riley Harmon, Oscar Peters, and Nina Sarnelle — are 
presenting their ?nal theses in the exhibit, which 
opened last Friday.
The ?rst ?oor of the gallery features work by Sarnelle, 
who “makes fantasies, miracles and lies ... [whose] 
performances explore the physicality of metaphysics 
and the malleability of belief,” as described in her artist’s 
statement. Sarnelle’s featured work tells the story of a 
social experiment in relationships that she conducted 
over the last year.
She mailed 400 letters to people living near her home. 
Each letter began, “Dear Soon to be Old Friend, I am 
interested in inventing the narrative of our relationship. 
This story may not have existed before but will most 
certainly exist from now on.” Sarnelle’s experiment 
resulted in the formation of friendships based on an 
improvised non-reality. “I really enjoy getting lost in 
something and not knowing what’s real anymore,” she 
explained.
Sarnelle’s art is different from what people visiting the 
gallery may initially expect, as her chosen medium for 
this particular project was not painting, drawing, or 
sculpture. Instead, she worked through people, building 
?ctional relationships that have developed into real 
relationships that continue to ?ourish today. In this way, 
her work is among the most interesting of the exhibition.
Choi, Peters, and Bolt’s artwork is featured on the 
second ?oor of the gallery. Stepping out of the elevator, 
visitors are immediately struck by the enormousness 
of Peters’ work, which takes up the central area and 
includes a six-foot, 300-pound model of the moon that 
is situated on a circular wooden track. In the center of 
the track, a large green lion’s head sits atop a spar, and 
three red banshee heads, which appear to be silently 
screaming, hang from the ceiling. If the sheer size and 
aesthetics of Peters’ piece — which he described in 
his artist statement as “halfway between Sisyphus and 
Indiana Jones” — aren’t interesting enough, the piece 
is also mechanized so that the banshee heads move and 
the moon rolls around the track.
“I love Oscar’s piece. I like the physicality of it,” said 
Sarah Keeling, a sophomore art major. “It’s like a lot of 
his other work in that it’s really physical and you don’t 
know if it’s going to be dangerous or not.”
While Peters’ piece was certainly entertaining to 
observe, it lacked cohesion. For the art observer who 
tries to connect the dots between the swaying banshee 
heads, the lion, and the moon in order to derive 
meaning, the piece disappoints.
On the left side of the room is Choi’s project — a 
watercolor animation series titled “Operation Mole.” 
His animations show a capsule-shaped time machine 
and its driver tunneling into the earth amid images of 
human carnage, war, pop culture, and political events. 
The work is loosely based on events from Korean history, 
but also draws inspiration from comics, science ?ction, 
and dark humor to create what Choi called “a kind of 
ridiculous, absurd landscape.” His work in this exhibit is 
aesthetically impressive and thought provoking.
Students who attended the opening expressed an 
appreciation of the balance that Choi and the others 
were able to strike between seriousness and fun.
“I like that everything I’ve seen so far is a little bit silly,” 
said Reese Adams-Romagnoli, a ?rst-year art student. 
“I think that’s really the way to go. I was expecting 
something more serious, but I was pleasantly surprised. 
I can see that a lot of thought has been put into what 
these artists produce, and I appreciate the mental 
stretching that it took to create things that are both fun 
and valid at the same time.”
Bolt’s work occupies the right side of the second-?oor 
space. Her piece “I’m Only Now” centers around what 
appears to be a stripper pole, which spectators can hold 
onto while a platform beneath their feet rotates around 
it.
Bolt explained that when spectators opt to take part, her 
project can be experienced in one of two ways. If the 
pole is perceived as a prop for a stripper, taking part will 
result in a “low experience.” Conversely, whirling around 
the pole can also be something very spiritual. “There 
is a suggestion of time being both present and kind of 
eternal,” she said. “The point [of the experience] is to 
use your body to see what you believe. You make it what 
you want it to be. You can get something more from the 
experience — this feeling that you’ll live forever.”
On the third ?oor of the gallery, England’s work includes 
custom-built gadgets, books, and cameras that are

the dormant sexuality in everyday life. The piece was 
created by Jonathan Armistead, a Master of Fine Arts 
student.

meant to engage viewers in the issues surrounding 
contemporary image consumption. “Technology has 
made it very easy for us to share media, but it is also 
very easy for us to lose that media,” England said. “I take 
impermanent things and make them permanent.”
England constructed a video-sharing mechanism, made 
from a wooden box and mounted on the gallery wall, 
as a parody of YouTube. The piece, complete with a 
view counter and pad of paper for viewer comments, 
is quite amusing, but it also raises a serious question 
about accessibility. Is ease of access more valuable than 
having media and information physically in our hands? 
England’s work feels very relevant to the issues our 
current generation faces.
Also on display is a camcorder that has been 
manipulated to function like its more primitive 
predecessors. Pieces of wood have been screwed to 
the camera’s frame to eliminate higher-tech features. 
Additionally, England has produced a physical back-up 
for his e-book copy of George Orwell’s 1984, as well 
as pamphlets that teach one how to mimic popular 
typefaces.
Armistead’s art — a large, pink, fountain-like structure 
made from of?ce chairs, lotion bottles, and tissue boxes, 
all of which are held together by a metal frame — takes 
up the center space. White liquid ?ows from the lotion 
bottles into bowls that sit on the seats of the of?ce 
chairs, while tissues fan out from the tops of the tissue 
boxes.
Armistead aims to “highlight an often dormant sexuality 
that exists within our everyday,” according to his artist’s 
statement. He said that his sculpture, titled “Reach Out 
and Touch No One,” reveals the importance of the of?ce 
chair as a prop in people’s sexual lives.
“Every time I see an of?ce chair in someone’s house, I 
think about how often they masturbate on it. I see an 
of?ce chair, and I see sex,” Armistead said, pointing 
out that the majority of porn circulation takes place 
through the internet and that people in long-distance 
relationships can now engage in “Skype sex.”
“Also, these chairs represent the body because they are 
ergonomically designed to ?t the body,” he continued. 
Armistead’s fountain of lotion and chairs is comical, 
disturbing, and effective. It successfully approaches 
a socially taboo topic without pushing viewers away, 
and simultaneously maintains the important element of 
visual appeal. “I really like the armchair piece,” said Katie 
O’Conner, a ?rst-year art major. “I like that the aesthetics 
hide the technological parts of it — the pipes and tubes.”
To the right of Armistead’s work, Harmon presents 
a series of three videos. Though created separately, 
the videos share certain elements, including guns, 
performances, and the space inside of a vehicle. The 
videos coincide in a way that blurs the line between past 
and present, fantasy and reality.
Along with the three videos he created, Harmon also 
displays pictures of people imitating a popular scene 
from the movie I Am Legend that he found on the 
internet. The pictures all feature individuals curled up in 
their bathtubs with a gun and something else they value, 
most often a pet.
For the opening of the exhibition, Harmon also had a live 
musician who resembled Ryan Gosling playing guitar. 
This coincided with Harmon’s integration of scenes from 
the movie Drive, which features Gosling, into one of 
his three videos. The discreet way in which the pieces 
of Harmon’s piece come together sets it apart from the 
other projects.
Commenting on Harmon’s piece, Talia Levin, a ?rst-year 
Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in creative 
writing and drama, said, “I like it, because I feel like you 
can draw your own conclusions from it. It’s a lot to take 
in but not so much that it’s unreachable, or that I felt 
detached. The message isn’t shoved down your throat, 
but it’s also not so abstract that you can’t get it.”
Together, the seven artists have put together a 
memorable exhibit that explores a variety of topics — 
from masturbation to technology — through a variety of 
mediums.
The exhibition will remain open to the public through 
April 22. The Miller Gallery is located in the Purnell 
Center for the Arts.

Master of Fine Arts student Oscar Peters created a large-scale installation featuring a rolling 300-pound model 
of the moon. Though visually interesting and overwhelmingly physical, Peters’ piece created some confusion for 
viewers trying to find the connection among the moon, lion’s head, and hanging banshee heads.

Over 3,000 people converged at the Wyndham 
Grand hotel in downtown Pittsburgh when it hosted 
Tekkoshocon X, a Japanese culture convention, last 
Wednesday to Sunday. Many participants, known as 
cosplayers, came in hand-crafted costumes as anti-
zombie commandos, school girls, wizards, aliens, 
knights, monsters, and more. Those not sporting 
guises wore shirts that declared their allegiance to 
superhero teams or their affection for certain video 
game characters.
This is the 10th Tekkoshocon — a portmanteau of 
convention and the Japanese word for steel mill. The 
?rst convention was the brainchild of a University of 
Pittsburgh student, who organized the convention 
in 2002. The event is run wholly by volunteers 
— from the administrators to those holding up 
signs indicating where the snaking lines of people 
clamoring for spots in screenings and panels begin.
One of those volunteers, Barry Marchetto, a junior 
biology major at Allegheny College of Meadville, has 
been coming to Tekkoshocon since its inaugural 
year. “So I ?gured, why not work here?” Marchetto 
said. “It gives me something to do in the downtime 
between panels.”
Having a panel only requires a willingness to do 
paperwork, leading to a highly diverse set of topics. 
Some explained the symbolism of the logos of 
obscure television shows, and others taught the 
dance moves to the latest pop songs from East Asia. 
Some of the nerdier aspects of Western culture 
were also represented, with discussions about the 
nuances of card games, what it means to be Bronie 
(an adult fan of My Little Pony), and the webcomic 
Homestuck.
The convention also featured voice actors who work 
on the English versions of animes, various musical 
and comedy acts, and an area for vendors. The 
vendors were dif?cult to access, however, since 
only a limited number of shoppers were allowed at a 
time. The fourth ?oor was dedicated to playing card 
games, a wide selection of video games, and several 
Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.
Still, cosplayers owned the day. Adventure Time 
heroes crossed swords with Darth Vader, as the 
dancing robot of LMFAO music video fame shuf?ed 
by the titular character of Inyuasha playing songs 
from the Persona 4 soundtrack on the lobby piano. 
The most anticipated events were the Masquerade, 
a group competition in which cosplayers performed 
a small talent-show-type skit, and an individual 
competition where contestants were judged on the 
quality of their costumes’ construction.
Enthusiasm for the costume aspect of the 
convention lead to the development of Carnegie 
Mellon’s own Cosplay Club. Mainly a development 
of the Vermillion Anime Club, the Cosplay Club 
was spearheaded by Angelique Rein, a ?rst-year 
Japanese and linguistics double major. Rein is a 
veteran cosplayer.
“I started going to conventions as a freshman in 
high school, and after seeing everybody else, [me 
and my friends] decided to try it ourselves,” she 
said. Rein believes that accuracy takes dedication 
— her costume for Pokémon Gym Leader Erika for 
Tekkoshocon took over 40 hours of work — but is 
rewarding in the end. “People take pictures with 
you, they’re just happy to see you, and all your hard 
work pays off.”
