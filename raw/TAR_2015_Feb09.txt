Halfway through term, StuGov launches initiatives website
LAURA SCHERB
Publisher
Halfway through any poli-
tician’s term, they can expect 
to be evaluated by their con-
stituents and the media to 
gauge how effective their ef-
forts have been and how much 
of their platforms they have 
achieved. And the university’s 
student body president and 
vice president are no different.
As election season looms 
on campus, it’s time for senior 
electrical and computer engi-
neering and business admin-
istration  double major and 
Student Body President Ian 
Glasner, as well as his cabi-
net, to re?ect on what they’ve 
accomplished and the work 
ahead, both for them and the 
executive body that will follow.
Last March, during the de-
bates, Glasner and his running 
mate, senior biological sci-
ences major and ?rst year ac-
celerated master’s candidate 
Shalini Ray, ran on a platform 
that focused on the student 
experience and how students 
could have a greater hand at 
in?uencing campus affairs.
Part of his ongoing effort 
to gauge student interest is a 
website that allows students 
to both submit new ideas for 
initiatives and to vote on ?ve 
rotating initiatives. “Looking 
at the student body and its 
preferences last year, I found 
it hard to gauge what stu-
dents were interested in and 
what they wanted. I wanted 
a tool to help create a better 
understanding of how student 
government could more ap-
propriately address students’ 
needs,” Glasner said. Accord-
ing to Glasner, the soft launch 
at the end of last semester 
yielded approximately 400 
student votes. “We used the 
last launch to gauge how well 
it would work for the student 
body and plan to advertise it 
further this semester,” he said.
On Thursday, Glasner 
reached out to the campus 
community via email to of-
?cially launch the website, 
asking that students “take 30 
seconds” to login and indicate 
which ideas they supported, 
which include dormitory alco-
hol policy, shuttle and escort 
services, the university’s mor-
atorium policy, cross registra-
tion programs, and a healthy 
campus no-smoking initiative. 
Glasner and his administra-
tion will use the votes to help 
indicate which areas of their 
platform they need to focus on 
in their term’s second half.
According to Glasner, he’s 
focused on the policy behind 
the practice — or why the uni-
versity is run the way that it is 
— and how that can be made 
more ef?cient and consistent 
across campus. One of the 
most important issues, both to 
him and to his constituents, is 
the revision of the dormitory 
alcohol policy that governs 
campus. The initiative cur-
rently has the highest num-
ber of votes on the website, at 
374 at the time of publication, 
compared to the second high-
est number of votes at 368 for 
expanded shuttle services to 
local neighborhoods during 
non-peak hours.
“Last year, when I took of-
?ce, [we] found discrepancies 
in how each dorm executes 
the policies set forth by the 
administration, and are now 
working with the administra-
tion and student life to put 
everyone back on the same 
page. Everyone is governed by 
the same policies and there-
fore should be implementing 
the same practices,” Glasner 
said. Glasner’s administration 
has also been focused on the 
housing and dining prices and 
policies.
“I’m very excited about 
the improvements that hous-
ing and dining have made to 
their facilities, but prices need 
to be lowered,” Glasner said. 
Through student advisory 
counsels and lots of conver-
sations with administration, 
Glasner feels that the dining 
services on campus have seen 
a vast improvement during his 
tenure in of?ce, citing longer 
hours, healthier options, and 
a more open channel of com-
munication with Pascal Pet-
ter, the new director of dining 
services.
Glasner hopes that the 
website will remind students 
that student government is 
working for them, and that the 
future student body presidents 
will continue to use the site.
“This website will increase 
awareness of what student 
government is doing for you. 
I would hope that this will 
change people’s attitudes to-
ward student government. In 
the past, student government 
has targeted issues that stu-
dents don’t necessarily care 
about, so I felt that we needed 
a way to concretely establish 
students’ needs,” Glasner said.
Uber, CMU partner in drive for safer tech

Need a late night ride? 
Soon when you take an Uber, 
your ride may be ?tted with 
technology created by mem-
bers of the Carnegie Mellon 
community.
The university announced 
a partnership on Feb. 
2 with ride-sharing 
service Uber Tech-
nologies, Inc. to 
found the Uber 
Advanced Tech-
nologies Cen-
ter. Members 
of the center, 
which will 
be located 
near cam-
pus, will 
aim to de-
velop safe 
and reliable 
transporta-
tion tech-
nologies.
“The ro-
botics technol-
ogy over the 
past decade has 
really matured to 
a level where it’s 
ready for transfer to 
industry,” said Martial 
Hebert, director of Carn-
egie Mellon’s Robotics Insti-
tute. “Uber is ready to do big 
things with robotics technolo-
gy and the Robotics Institute.”
Uber, a ride-sharing ser-
vice which now operates in 
over 270 cities, allows users to 
request a ride from a partici-
pating driver through an app, 
which also handles the rate 
charged and payment.
Hebert framed the creation 
of the center as part of a 
bigger picture, 
saying, 
“be-
yond this spe-
ci?c partnership, I would 
expect to see a lot more devel-
opment of robotics industry in 
Pittsburgh.”
“This is part of a larger 
trend, and the Robotics In-
stitute is at the center of that 
trend,” he continued.
As part 
of the 
creation 
of the center, a 
number of members from the 
Robotics Institute’s National 
Robotics Engineering Center 
(NREC) will be leaving NREC 
for the new center, according 
to an email sent to members 
of the School of Computer 
Science by the school’s dean, 
Andrew Moore. 
Moore did not note the 
number of members moving 
in the email, but stated that 
more detail will be provided 
“when we’re together for 
the Founder’s Day SCS 
events in March.”
Molly Spaeth, 
a spokesperson 
for Uber, said 
via email that 
those at the 
company 
are “excit-
ed to join 
the com-
munity of 
Pittsburgh 
and part-
ner with 
the experts 
at Carn-
egie Mel-
lon Univer-
sity, whose 
breadth and 
depth of techni-
cal expertise, par-
ticularly in robotics, 
are unmatched.”
Spaeth also noted 
that, as part of the agree-
ment, Uber will provide 
funding for faculty chairs and 
graduate students.

What will Carnegie Mel-
lon be like 20 or 30 years 
from now? A matter of in-
creasing interest and sig-
ni?cance in light of today’s 
rapidly evolving world, this 
question was raised by one 
of the university communi-
ty’s newest members as food 
for thought during a recent 
strategic planning town hall 
meeting.
Dr. K. Jimmy Hsia, the 
new vice provost for interna-
tional programs and strategy 
as of Jan. 1, is a man with a 
vision to increase the uni-
versity’s global footprint. 
Though he’s only been on 
campus for a short period of 
time, Dr. Hsia, who is also a 
professor of biomedical and 
mechanical engineering in 
the College of Engineering, 
seems to be having no trouble 
integrating himself into the 
Carnegie Mellon community.
Hsia received his Bachelor 
of Science from Tsinghua 
University in Beijing, China 
and his Ph.D. from the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology. 
He is a fellow of American 
Association for the Advance-
ment of Science (AAAS) and 
was the W. Grafton and Lil-
lian B. Wilkins Professor of 
Mechanical Science and En-
gineering at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
(UIUC).
During his time at UIUC, 
Dr. Hsia worked to develop 
worldwide opportunities 
in research and education 
for faculty and students in 
a number of countries in 
the Asian continent. He has 
served as chair of the UIUC-
Zhejiang University Joint 
Institute Working Group. In 
addition to playing a role in 
nurturing global partner-
ships, he also aided students 
and faculty members in es-
tablishing dynamic relation-
ships with other educational 
institutions and corporations 
across China.
Additionally, Dr. Hsia 
served as founding director 
of the Nano and Bio Mechan-
ics Program at the National 
Science Foundation from 
“Having an 
international 
strategy is not 
a luxury — it is 
survival.”

vost for international 
programs and strategy

governed by the 
same policies 
and, therefore, 
should be 
implementing 
the same 
practices.”

Professor of history Don-
na Harsch has been selected 
to succeed Caroline Acker as 
head of Carnegie Mellon’s 
history department.
“Professor Harsch will be 
an excellent successor to Car-
oline Acker, who did a terri?c 
job of quite sel?essly leading 
the department for the last 
four years of her career at 
Carnegie Mellon,” said Rich-
ard Scheines, dean of the 
Dietrich College of Humani-
ties and Social Sciences, in a 
university press release.
Harsch is a social and 
political historian of mod-
ern Germany, and “she has 
proved to be a versatile and 
wide-ranging scholar of the 
20th century,” said Scheines 
in the press release, adding 
that he is “excited to work 
with her.” Harsch joined the 
faculty at Carnegie Mellon in 
1990.
Harsch’s goals as depart-
ment head include “to con-
tinue the department’s fo-
cus on social, cultural, and 
policy history, its strongly 
global scholarly orientation, 
and its inclusion of interdis-
ciplinary methodologies, 
especially anthropology,” ac-
cording to the news release. 
She also hopes to encourage 
interdepartmental collabora-
tion among Dietrich faculty 
and to increase the history 
department’s international 
exposure.
“It’s an exciting time for 
the History Department,” 
said Harsch in the release. 
“As we continue to shape our 
research pro?le, there is [an] 
opportunity to revamp our 
policy work and bring the 
department together through 
shared interests such as so-
cial movements, resistance to 
inequalities and resisting the 
powers that be.”
Former head Acker has 
held the position since 2011 
and plans to retire. The tran-
sition will be effective begin-
ning July 1.

Robotics Institute develops new quadrotor
A small quadrotor devel-
oped by Carnegie Mellon’s 
Robotics Institute, in con-
junction with spin-off com-
pany Sensible Machines, 
demonstrated its potential 
to aid ?re?ghting efforts in 
con?ned naval spaces.
The demonstration was 
held aboard a former U.S. 
Navy ship as part of the Of?ce 
of Naval Research (ONR)’s 
Damage Control Technolo-
gies for the 21st Century 
(DC-21) project. In the dem-
onstration, the quadrotor 
“?ew autonomously through 
dark, smoke-?lled compart-
ments to map ?res and locate 
victims,” according to a uni-
versity press release. “With 
the micro-?yer, we wanted 
to show that it could autono-
mously navigate through the 
narrow hallways and doors 
— even in dense ?re smoke 
— and locate ?res,” said 
DC-21 program manager 
Thomas McKenna, accord-
ing to the press release. “It 
succeeded at all those tasks.”
The drone has the capa-
bility of “fast lightweight au-
tonomy,” and it uses a RGB-D 
camera, or depth camera, as 
its primary sensor for use in 
building a map of ?re areas.
In addition to its utility in 
managing shipboard ?res, 
the drone will also assist “in-
vestigation of building ?res 
and inspection of hazardous 
chemical tanks and power 
plant cooling towers,” ac-
cording to Sebastian Scherer, 
systems scientist at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Robotics Institute, 
in the press release.

media sources report that 
researchers at the Uber Ad-
vanced Technologies Center 
will focus speci?cally on self-
driving cars, both Hebert and 
Byron Spice, director of me-
dia relations for the School 
of Computer Science, said 
no speci?c research plans or 
goals have been discussed be-
tween Uber and the Robotics 
Institute.
“A lot of that is part of the 
company plans, and we’re not 
necessarily privy to the detail 
of the projects,” Hebert said.
“What you see a lot in the 
external media is reporters 
taking two and two and com-
ing up with a four or a ?ve,” 
Spice added. “Uber has made 
certain statements about 
their interests, and then there 
have been speculations on 
top of that.”
According to a post on 
Uber’s blog, the partnership 
will allow Uber leadership to 
work with members of Carn-
egie Mellon “to do research 
and development, primarily 
in the areas of mapping and 
vehicle safety and autonomy 
technology.”
Hebert also says that 
while the center will be lo-
cated in Pittsburgh, there are 
no concrete plans for its loca-
tion, nor a timeline for its of-
?cial opening. “Many of the 
particular details have to be 
worked out still,” he said.
Uber will be holding an 
event in Pittsburgh to cel-
ebrate this partnership in the 
coming weeks, according to 
Spaeth. 
The company currently 
holds an experimental license 
to operate in Pittsburgh, one 
it obtained after a series of 
legal hearings involving the 
Pennsylvania Public Utility 
Commission (PUC). 
Concerns regarding insur-
ance and to what extent ride-
sharing services function as 
taxis were cited by the PUC 
when they ?led a cease-and-
desist order against the com-
pany last year. 
The experimental license 
is set to expire after two 
years.
Hebert summarized the 
partnership by saying, “From 
my perspective, the impor-
tant thing ... is that this com-
pany has demonstrated to the 
world just how important ro-
botics skills are.”

the Graduate College at UIUC 
from 2009–10, and associate 
vice chancellor for research 
for new initiatives at UIUC 
from 2011–13.
To Dr. Hsia, “having an 
international strategy is not 
a luxury, it is survival,” as he 
said at the recent town hall, 
adding that, in recent years, 
the university has done well 
in establishing its footprints 
internationally.
Dr. Hsia believes that the 
core of international strat-
egy lies with the students, 
faculty and staff. In his words, 
“These are the people doing 
international things — faculty 
students and staff. Without 
them, there is no internation-
al strategy.”
Moving forward, Dr. Hsia 
intends to work toward main-
taining the university’s high 
quality of education while si-
multaneously preparing stu-
dents for future worldwide 
challenges. He ultimately 
aims for the university to be-
come a global hub of knowl-
edge, culture, and technol-
ogy, all the while upholding a 
position amongst the world’s 
top educational institutions. 
Moreover, he aims to achieve 
results through a collective ef-
fort, with individuals across 
the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity coming together and 
working as one.
So, what will Carnegie 
Mellon be like 20 or 30 years 
from now? 
For Dr. Jimmy Hsia, a 
school with an even larger 
international footprint is in 
reach.

* Denotes executive committee member
Last Monday, Carnegie Mellon 
announced a partnership with Uber 
in building the Uber Advanced Tech-
nologies Center. Most of the media 
focus has surrounded the possibility 
of self-driving cars, which promise to 
increase the safe, reliable transporta-
tion offered by Uber.
While this partnership offers a 
bright view into the future, there are 
also reasons to be wary of the poten-
tial consequences of Carnegie Mel-
lon teaming up with a company con-
stantly in the news for all the wrong 
reasons.
There are always reasons to be 
excited about technological part-
nerships. The ?nal results are often 
enough to make life better for large 
swaths of the population, but inter-
mediary discoveries in both software 
and hardware occasionally have the 
same effect.
Driverless cars in particular offer 
a rosy look to the future. Optimized 
driving routes and signi?cantly bet-
ter reaction times could improve 
highway safety and even minimize 
traf?c. A world with fewer automo-
bile accident deaths would be excel-
lent, and if we reduce smog in the 
process that would be a major plus.
Unfortunately, there is some 
reason to question the prudence in 
partnering with Uber. Several claims 
have been publicly levied against 
Uber in recent months, and it would 
be naïve to simply ignore what has 
been said about the company.
One claim is that Uber under-
cuts taxi workers, specialized union 
workers who provide an important 
service. Undermining their job se-
curity by putting Uber cars on the 
market functionally busts the union, 
since Uber drivers are not unionized.
The partnership between Uber 
and CMU seems to respond to this in 
two ways. 
The ?rst is listed on the Carnegie 
Mellon press release on the partner-
ship, stating that the center could 
create jobs in the innovation sector, 
an increasingly important compo-
nent of Pittsburgh’s economy. Sec-
ond, driverless cars theoretically will 
make cabs much safer, improv-
ing the quality of the service, 
which is good for consumers.
An-other issue with the 
partnership is a moral qualm with 
Uber’s business practices. The most 
signi?cant of Uber’s questionable 
practices was when an executive 
?oated the idea of running smear 
campaigns against critical journal-
ists, in what he believed to be an off-
the-record discussion.
Another common qualm has to do 
with its interaction with competitors. 
Uber has been accused of ordering 
large numbers of cars from Lyft — its 
main competitor — and then cancel-
ing them, wasting the drivers’ time. 
Uber has also falsely told its drivers 
that working for both Uber and Lyft 
is banned by city ordinances in areas 
such as New York City.
It is always exciting to see Carn-
egie Mellon engaging the companies 
we hear about every day in an effort 
to increase the technological capa-
bilities of the average citizen, but it is 
important to be aware of whom the 
university is working with. The po-
tential returns on a partnership with 
Uber are large, but Uber will have 
to change their tune before we will 
be truly comfortable to be af?liated 
with it.
CMU should be careful when hitching ride with Uber

Last week, Apple Inc. reported 
the most pro?table quarter of any 
company in corporate history.
For Q1, going from Oct.–Dec. 
2014, Apple posted quarterly rev-
enue of $74.6 billion and quarterly 
net pro?t of $18 billion at a gross 
margin of 39.9 percent. Numbers 
like these are unheard of for even 
the largest, most successful compa-
nies in the world.
For some perspective, if you com-
bine the revenue of Apple’s three 
biggest competitors — Microsoft, 
Amazon, and Google — over the 
same period, it amounts to $73.9 
billion, less than Apple’s by millions. 
Even more impressive, however, is 
the fact that despite being so much 
bigger than its competitors, Apple is 
growing far more quickly; its sales 
grew 30 percent year over year, as 
opposed to 8 percent for Microsoft 
and 15 percent for both Amazon and 
Google.
Apple seems to be defying the 
laws of what should be possible for 
any business. Perhaps for this rea-
son, despite it being the most suc-
cessful company in the world, the 
dominant 
narrative 
around 
Apple is 
that it is 
barely 
hang-
ing 
on by 
the 
skin 
of its 
teeth.
From the looks of it, outside of 
the now irrelevant mp3 player mar-
ket, Apple doesn’t dominate a single 
market it is in. From smartphones 
and tablets to laptops and desktops, 
Apple routinely ?ghts it out for high 
single-digit to low double-digit mar-
ket shares. It seems paradoxical to 
think of Apple as an industry leader. 
Furthermore, Apple only competes 
for the highest income bracket, ap-
parently going after none but the 
most af?uent consumers. As mar-
kets commodify with time and trend 
toward cheaper goods of lesser 
quality, how does Apple compete?
Juan Pablo Vazquez Sampere of 
the Harvard Business Review writes 
that “we shouldn’t be dazzled by Ap-
ple’s earnings report,” arguing that 
Apple isn’t revolutionizing indus-
tries anymore. Even Larry Ellison, 
Steve Job’s old friend, argues that 
Apple without Steve Jobs is doomed 
to repeat its mistakes from the 90s.
The general public doesn’t seem 
to buy into Apple’s future either. 
Apple has a price-to-earnings Ra-
tio of 16, lower than Google’s at 
27.25, and far lower than Ama-
zon’s obscene 869.51. Furthermore, 
the narrative of doom and gloom 
around Apple has been consistent 
for the past 5–6 years, and Apple 
has consistently proved its naysay-
ers wrong.
Why is the majority so skeptical 
of Apple’s success? I believe this is 
because very few people truly un-
derstand Apple’s business model. 
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were 
roundly criticized, much like the 
previous four models, for not being 
particularly revolutionary. Yet, the 
iPhone sold 74.5 million units this 
past quarter.
The critics are right. The iPhone, 
much like the iPad or the Mac, 
isn’t particularly revolutionary any 
more. To me, however, this just 
makes Apple’s record-shattering 
results all the more remarkable. If 
people aren’t buying these products 
because they’re ahead of the curve, 
they can only be buying them for 
the one differentiator that these 
products have: great design.
In a sense, Apple’s greatest 
achievement isn’t the iPod, iPhone, 
iPad, or any of its hit products. I be-
lieve that, far more importantly, it 
has established beyond all doubt 
that people are willing to pay for 
good design. 
While the majority of the 
market will race toward the 
Apple bathes in money, de?es business wisdom

A PERSON’S OPINION
The Tartan is preparing to spend this Saturday covered in chocolate and novelty teddy bears. So we asked,
How do you feel about Valentine’s Day?
Compiled by Justin McGown
As the ?rst month of 2015 drew 
to a close, one of the most prominent 
news stories of 2014 made its way 
back onto the front pages. When 
the Ukrainian government stabi-
lized itself last summer, with Petro 
Poroshenko taking the presidential 
of?ce, many expected the violence 
in eastern Ukraine, centered around 
Donetsk, to slowly fade away.
However, the con?ict has fes-
tered. The regional Euromaidan 
protests gave way to an even larger 
international con?ict between the 
Ukrainian national government and 
Russian-backed separatist rebels. 
Many analysts point to a return to 
an American-Russian con?ict much 
like the Cold War. Even the man 
who is earmarked to be the next 
Secretary of Defense, Ashton Cart-
er, said that he was very much “in-
clined” to send aid to Ukraine, even 
if the aid could be labeled “lethal” 
in nature. CNN has suggested that 
possible American arming of the 
Ukrainian armed forces against the 
Russian-led rebels would take “the 
worst East-West confrontation since 
the Cold War into a new and unpre-
dictable stage.”
Such a Cold War-reminiscent 
framework of the con?ict is ?awed, 
with the White House keen to clarify 
rumors on American involvement 
in the region. “A decision like this 
will be made by the Commander-
in-Chief,” said White House spokes-
man Josh Earnest. The American 
debate over Ukrainian aid is sparked 
by reports of a heavy Ukrainian de-
feat in the East.
The Ukrainian rebels have often 
been labelled “Russian Proxies.” 
With a return to Cold War tactics, 
a group of hawkish Senators led by 
Senator John McCain have called for 
the shipment of offensive weapons 
and arms to Ukraine in order to de-
ter the rebels. America has supplied 
defensive equipment, such as night 
vision goggles, to the Ukrainian gov-
ernment, but never military equip-
ment to attack the rebel forces. Such 
a move could only provoke Russian 
President Vladimir Putin and Rus-
sian forces as they would see the 
need to further attack Ukraine.
According to the Wall Street Jour-
nal, a silent peace agreement draft-
ed by the Kremlin was sent to Euro-
pean governments calling for peace 
in addition to increased autonomy 
and territory. It was rejected, how-
ever, and German and French lead-
ers Angela Merkel and Francois 
Hollande have traveled to Kiev and 
Moscow in hopes of hashing out a 
peace deal. 
From a Russian point of view, a 
cease?re would be optimal. Putin 
faces disaster as the funds of oli-
garchs and politicians who have 
kept him in power, due to Russia’s 
economic rise a decade ago and the 
boom of Russia’s natural gas and oil 
industry, dry up. The Russian ruble 
lies in tatters, and the annexation of 
Crimea and the con?ict with Ukrai-
nian forces continue to pile pressure 
on the Russian government.
Putin also knows that a further 
push towards Kiev could be di-
sastrous with international pow-
ers watching Russia’s every move. 
Moreover, Ukraine’s economic fate 
is tied to that of Russia. “He has no 
way to erode Ukraine’s economy 
without simultaneously destroying 
Russia’s,” according to Alexander 
Motyl, a Rutgers Univesity political 
science professor, in Foreign Affairs.
These factors must and should 
be played into negotiations, which 
suggest that Ukraine can soon reach 
some sort of cease?re. Ukraine is a 
country that needs to be rebuilt. Its 
government infrastructure lacks sta-
bility and anti-corruption measures, 
and its government is constantly 
edging near default. The next few 
days could be key to determining 
the future of Russia, Ukraine, and 
all of Europe.

In the wake of a spat with al Qaeda 
leadership over a merge with another 
arm in the organization, al Qaeda in 
Iraq (AQI) refused to restrict their op-
erations solely within Iraqi territory. 
AQI broke off and formed the group 
called the Islamic State (IS).
This group is often referred to by 
its former name, the Islamic State of 
Iraq and Syria (ISIS), since the name 
“IS” wrongly associates Islam with 
the group’s despicable actions. The 
change in name, in addition to ISIS’s 
methods of mobilizing against “the 
near enemy” instead of the West, led 
to the belief that al Qaeda broke off 
relations because ISIS was “too ex-
treme.”
While that is a bit of an oversim-
pli?cation, al Qaeda did believe that 
ISIS was unnecessarily brutal, to the 
point of hurting their cause. How-
ever, current events seem to suggest 
that ISIS has been and will continue 
to be successful. Its fairly extensive 
network of captured territories sig-
ni?es what might be one of the most 
well-designed radical groups in his-
tory, and radical is an extremely ac-
curate descriptor. Just this week, 
ISIS released a video of a Jordanian 
pilot burning to death and the last 
American hostage was, according to 
ISIS, killed in a Jordanian airstrike 
(this claim is highly questionable, ac-
cording to The Atlantic). This set off 
another round of debate as to what 
America should do.
ISIS’s ample funding and savvy or-
ganization have produced quick and 
stunning success. Overnight, ISIS 
took control of a strip of land that 
extends from Syria’s northern border 
with Turkey to the northeastern ar-
eas of Iraq. ISIS’s rapid rise to power 
went conspicuously unimpeded by 
Western forces, particularly America.
America has been extraordinarily 
hands-on in the region over the past 
decade, supporting rebellions and 
generally imposing its political will. 
ISIS is based on vicious religious 
oppression and systematic violence 
against those who disagree with its 
views. It is uncontroversial to say 
they pose a threat to the interests of 
both citizen and state, in both Amer-
ica and the northern stretches of the 
Levant. Why was this the moment 
America chose to turn its back?
One reason often cited is that ISIS 
happened to be ?ghting Iran’s stron-
gest allies in the region, Iraq and Syr-
ia. This is a pretty questionable rea-
son for America to leave ISIS alone. 
A destabilized Middle East is bad for 
both American interests and its allies 
in the region, including Israel.
The fact that ISIS was attacking 
Iran’s allies means nothing unless 
America sees ISIS as either an ally 
or neutral. However, the potential of 
ISIS being considered neutral is more 
likely the issue. ISIS’s obsession with 
destroying “the near enemy” before 
they tackle the West is favorable to 
the American government because 
ISIS wants to localize its battles in-
stead of coming here.
While decades of pro-democracy 
and pro-freedom rhetoric certainly 
felt hollow and self-interested, the 
United States’ inaction has strongly 
con?rmed these feelings. America 
initially went into Iraq with the stat-
ed goal of spreading democracy. 
Cut to mid 2014, and an organiza-
tion staunchly opposed to democracy 
rules the land America “liberated.” 
Since ISIS’s target has not been the 
United States, the American govern-
ment dragged its feet, allowing ISIS 
to become a major international 
threat before America did anything 
meaningful. Eventually, public ex-
ecutions of American citizens forced 
the government’s hand, and Ameri-
cans have been launching air strikes 
on ISIS, but that does not cut to the 
heart of the problem. America has a 
publicly stated foreign policy goal of 
intervening when governments be-
come oppressive. It needs to either 
drop this fairly imperialist policy or 
start taking it at face value rather 
than using “oppressive” as code for 
“not an ally”. If America wanted 
to lend legitimacy to its policy of 
spreading democracy, it would not 
have stalled until Americans feared 
for their domestic security.
Countless people have been killed 
or injured both mentally and physi-
cally by ISIS, and even more have 
been displaced from their homes. 
People continue to be brutalized as 
the organization ravages their home-
lands. America’s sudden silence on 
spreading democracy and the no-
table hole in its often philosophi-
cally cosmopolitan rhetoric speaks 
volumes more than empty platitudes 
about Iraq’s ?rst breaths of freedom 
ever did.

U.S.’s democratic rhetoric at odds with inaction on ISIS

Mental disorders deserve cannabis

After never even seeing the ?oor 
in the House last fall, the bill to legal-
ize medical marijuana in Pennsylva-
nia may see a comeback this year.
Since the ultra-conservative Gov-
ernor Tom Corbett has been replaced 
by pro-legalization Governor Tom 
Wolf, the bill de?nitely has much 
more hope of making it further in 
the legislative process and getting 
passed. While its passage would be 
a great step in such a traditionally 
right-leaning state, closer reading 
of the bill should confound support-
ers of legalization. While the idea 
of medical marijuana is progressive 
by its nature, the bill re?ects fairly 
conservative — or at least narrow-
minded — ideals.
The list of conditions that the bill 
covers is shockingly small: cancer, 
epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis (ALS), Parkinson’s, traumatic 
brain injury/post-concussion syn-
drome, multiple sclerosis, spinocer-
ebellar ataxia, cachexia (unintended 
extreme weight loss), post-traumat-
ic stress disorder (PTSD), muscle 
spasms, and severe ?bromyalgia. 
With the exception of PTSD (perhaps 
a political move intended to get the 
veterans’ support), there’s a shock-
ing absence of mental disorders on 
the list. Why should issues like anxi-
ety, depression, bipolar disorder, Al-
zheimer’s, and anorexia be bypassed 
under the legislation, when many of 
these are stigmatized enough with-
out the government’s help?
Researchers have found that mar-
ijuana use is effective in the treat-
ment of mood disorders because it 
helps to restore levels of a chemical in 
our brains called endocannabinoids, 
which can stabilize mood and help 
?ght off the effects of depression, 
anxiety, and others mental disorders. 
The increase in endocannabinoid 
levels also causes the “munchies,” 
or a larger appetite resulting from 
marijuana use, that not only makes 
the user want food, but increases the 
pleasure factor of eating by causing 
a release of dopamine. This helps to 
treat anorexia patients by condition-
ing them to equate eating and hap-
piness. Tellingly, only unintended 
weight loss, not anorexia, is covered 
under the bill.
Pennsylvania doesn’t want to 
provide medical marijuana to those 
with mental disorders, yet the drugs 
currently being prescribed to treat 
many mental disorders — those ap-
proved by the FDA — come with side 
effects that can be worse than the 
disorders they treat. Some common 
ones include weight loss, headaches, 
muscle spasms, nausea, seizures, or 
even the worsening of anxiety and 
depression. Coincidentally, all of 
these side effects are conditions that 
can be treated with marijuana use.
Moreover, many drugs prescribed 
to treat anxiety, depression, pain, 
sleep disorders, and so on have 
been known to be highly addictive, 
even when they aren’t intentionally 
abused. The most common unwant-
ed side effects of marijuana use in-
clude dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, 
dizziness, and fatigue. With much 
milder side effects and no evidence 
of physical dependence, marijuana is 
a much safer solution.
Additionally, marijuana treat-
ment can be personalized more 
easily than prescription drug treat-
ment. There exist hundreds of differ-
ent strains of marijuana, each with 
unique qualities. The two main cat-
egories are sativa and indica. Sativa 
is associated with more energizing 
effects, making the user feel uplift-
ed or euphoric, while indicas (“in 
da couch”) causes a much more re-
laxed, sleepy feeling. There are also 
hybrids in between the two that can 
be modi?ed for speci?c results.
There are several case studies out 
there proving the medical bene?ts 
of marijuana for a wide spectrum of 
disorders, mental as well as physical. 
Although it’s de?nitely encouraging 
that legislators are starting some-
where, I am in favor of a bill that in-
cludes a much more comprehensive 
list of conditions, taking more fac-
tors into account than what may be 
seen as socially appropriate.

Shots of stem cells restore learning ability in rats
Recently, researchers re-
ported that stem cells may be 
able to heal long-term brain 
damage in rats blasted with 
radiation. While radiation 
therapy is very effective in 
lots of areas, such as treating 
cancer, it has also been proven 
to generate many side effects 
such as detriments to one’s 
learning ability. 
Radiation obliterates the 
cells of the myelin sheath, 
which coats the message-car-
rying part of nerve cells with 
protective insulation. With-
out the myelin sheath, nerve 
cells cannot transmit any 
information.
Researchers have attempt-
ed to solve this problem using 
human stem cells. They in-
jected the precursor cells into 
different areas of the brains of 
18 rats, which were exposed to 
radiation prior to the injection. 
The rats given the new cells in 
different areas all improved in 
their ability to learn. But still, 
the researchers say that they 
need to repeat the experiment 
with a larger sample size to 
draw a ?nal conclusion.

Burials thwart efforts to curb spread of Ebola
Efforts to stamp out the se-
rious situation in West Africa 
due to the Ebola epidemic are 
being threatened as local vil-
lagers contract the disease by 
touching the bodies of Ebola 
victims while burying them, 
according to U.N. of?cials. Of-
?cials believe this is the most 
common way Ebola is being 
spread.
The issue is not one-sided; 
for local people in nations like 
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra 
Leone, those rituals are indis-
pensable for the departed’s 
spirit, so it is hard to ask them 
to give up such a practice.The 
World Health Organization 
(WHO) reported recently that 
124 new cases of Ebola were 
recorded the week of February 
1st, which is a 25 percent in-
crease from the previous week 
as well as the ?rst time this 
number has risen in 2015. 
The most effective method, 
according to a WHO represen-
tative, is to isolate individuals 
as soon as they become sick to 
avoid spreading the disease. 
This proves dif?cult since most 
burials occur in secret.

E-cigarettes found to lower immunity to ?u in mice
A new study in mice ?nds 
that electronic cigarette va-
pors can trigger in?ammation 
in the lung, making animals 
more susceptible to bacteria or 
virus-related infections, such 
as ?u. 
Inhaling free radicals, bio-
logically detrimental molecu-
lar fragments, may be the rea-
son for the in?ammation and 
protein damage. According to 
Thomas Sussan, a researcher 
at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg 
School of Public Health, each 
vaping puff contains 700 bil-
lion free radicals, leading to a 
“signi?cant increase in oxida-
tive stress.”
Compared with the mice 
that were not exposed to the 
vaping condition, the mice 
that inhale free radicals from 
vapor were far less able to re-
sist infection, the researchers 
found. The researchers con-
clude that, besides the fac-
tor of nicotine in vapor, even 
nicotine-free vaping may be 
a source of danger, since the 
liquid solvent used to deliver 
nicotine can also be very toxic 
to lungs’ functioning.

Large gap exists between public and scientists
A pair of surveys by the 
Pew Research Center and 
the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science 
(AAAS) released last Thursday 
showed that the general public 
and scientists have very differ-
ent views on science-related 
issues. 
For example, 87 percent of 
scientists believe that humans 
are a main cause of climate 
change, but only 50 percent 
of the public agree with this. 
Also, 88 percent of scientists 
think that genetically modi-
?ed foods are safe to eat, but 
only 37 percent of the public 
think they are safe. 89 percent 
of scientists favor animal re-
search, but only 47 percent of 
the public support it.
Alan Leshner, chief execu-
tive of the AAAS, stated that 
the chasm stems from the fact 
that the public’s views are be-
ing in?uenced by other factors 
such as religion, politics, and 
lack of scienti?c understand-
ing. He also noted that it is the 
responsibility of scientists to 
educate the public about po-
larized scienti?c issues.

Endangered Sierra Nevada red fox spotted
The Sierra Nevada red fox, 
a subspecies of the red fox and 
one of the most endangered 
mammals in North America, 
was recently spotted in Yosem-
ite National Park for the ?rst 
time in almost 100 years.
The animal was seen 
through cameras set up by 
wildlife biologists around the 
park as part of a study funded 
by the Yosemite Conservancy. 
The Sierra Nevada red fox, 
which is genetically different 
from other red foxes, once 
had a natural habitat which 
ranged from Oregon across 
California, but now fewer than 
50 of the animals are believed 
to exist in the wild. 
Researchers belive that the 
population of this particular 
species was always small. The 
reason for the dwindling pop-
ulation of Sierra Nevada red 
foxes is unclear, but scientists 
speculate that the cause could 
be loss of prey, genetic in-
breeding, and loss of habitiat. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service will be announcing 
the fox’s status under the En-
dangered Species Act this year.

Biological clock predicts life spans
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh’s Centre for 
Cognitive Ageing and Cogni-
tive Epidemiology have dis-
covered a biological clock that 
allows them to predict a per-
son’s life span. 
The biological clocks of al-
most 5,000 people in four in-
dependent studies were mea-
sured by studying a chemical 
modi?cation to their DNA. 
After an initial blood test, the 
researchers periodically fol-
lowed up with subjects. 
By tracking the lives of 
these people for up to 14 years 
and comparing their biologi-
cal clock age to their actual 
age, the researchers found 
that people whose biological 
clock indicated an older age 
than their actual age were 
more likely to die sooner. They 
also found that this fact was 
true even after adjusting the 
results to account for other 
conditions such as smoking 
and diabetes.This study was 
recently published in the jour-
nal Genome Biology.

HOW THINGS WORK

Imagine that you are a rock 
star, performing at what may 
be one of the biggest gigs of 
your career. The melodious 
growl of your electric guitar, 
paired with booming speak-
ers, allows your music to stay 
a?oat in the sea of screaming 
voices of your adoring fans. 
Most likely, it is largely thanks 
to this instrument that you 
have managed to reach the 
height of your career.
Interestingly, the excited 
reaction of your hypotheti-
cal, modern day audience is a 
huge contrast to the reaction 
of the skeptical public in the 
1930s when the electric gui-
tar ?rst arrived on the music 
scene. Initially emerging into 
obscurity, it wasn’t until the 
1950s and 1960s that the elec-
tric guitar entered the realm 
of popular American culture.
But how are electric guitars 
different from acoustic ones? 
Like acoustic guitars, electric 
guitars contain six strings that 
can be altered by tuning pegs. 
Embedded along the neck of 
an electric guitar are strips of 
metal called frets, which allow 
you to adjust the amplitude of 
vibration of the strings. It is 
the composition of the body 
that distinguishes an electric 
guitar from an acoustic one; 
while some share the hollow 
or semi-hollowness of acous-
tic guitars, most electric gui-
tars have solid bodies.
Without a resonating cav-
ity, what makes an electric 
guitar produce its strikingly 
eccentric sound? In 1924, 
Lloyd Loar, an engineer at 
the Gibson Guitar company, 
invented an electric magnetic 
pickup. Four years later, the 
design was later applied to the 
creation of the ?rst, commer-
cially advertised electric gui-
tar by the Stromberg-Voisinet 
company.
According to ehow.com, 
the magnetic pickup electron-
ically detects the vibration of 
the guitar strings. It consists 
of a bar magnet wrapped in 
thousands of turns of wire 
that are thinner than human 
hair. This allows it to act as 
both an electromagnet and a 
transducer, which is a device

the technical workforce, as 
well as the bene?ts and ne-
cessities of a gender-diverse 
workplace.
Elberfeld began the pre-
sentation with a story — a 
question from her husband: 
“Does it really matter if there 
are only, say, 25 percent 
women in the tech ?eld?” 
This question prompted her 
to do some research. She be-
gan to search for statistics, 
studies, and real-world data 
which would provide some 
practical answer beyond “the 
obvious social answer.” What 
she stumbled upon were sev-
eral statistics which, though 
exciting for women in gen-
eral, were worrisome for the 
female presence in the tech-
nical industry.
Elberfeld cited a recent 
study performed by the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and Carnegie Mellon 
which focused on overall 
“group intelligence,” a pre-
diction of a given group’s 
performance in any given 
situation. This group intelli-
gence, or synergy, is largely 
correlated to the group’s abil-
ity to cooperate as a whole, 
and the level of cooperation 
is linked to the number of 
women present in the group. 
The study correlates social 
sensitivity to presence of 
women. “Women are bet-
ter able to read between the 
lines and judge the social 
dynamics within the group,” 
said Elberfeld. This sensitiv-
ity is conducive to ?nancial 
success. “Gender-balanced 
companies perform better 
?nancially and demonstrate 
superior team dynamics and 
increased productivity,” El-
berfeld explained.
The problem facing the 
technical industry, however, 
is not a woman’s inability to 
bolster the effectiveness of a 
company — a gender-diverse 
workplace is far more syner-
getic than the alternative. The 
problem is that women are 
not taking up technical vo-
cations at a rate comparable 
to their male counterparts. 
“More girls than boys are tak-
ing AP tests,” said Elberfeld, 
“but only 19 percent of the AP 
Computer Science test-takers 
are girls. 57 percent of all 
undergraduate college stu-
dents are women. 42 percent 
of undergraduate math and 
statistics degrees are women, 
yet only 18 percent of all un-
dergraduate computer and 
information sciences degrees 
are earned by women.”

A multidisciplinary team 
comprising researchers from 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center (UPMC), and 
the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) has de-
veloped a micro?uidic device 
to assess cell-level processes 
in?uencing the pathophysiol-
ogy of sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell disease is a ge-
netic blood disorder that re-
sults in sickle hemoglobin, 
which causes red blood cells 
to mutate from their normal, 
doughnut shape to a rigid, 
crescent shape. According to 
Gregory Kato, MD, director of 
the Adult Sickle Cell Center 
of Excellence and Professor 
of Medicine at the Vascular 
Medicine Institute at UPMC, 
“these rigid sickle red blood 
cells interfere with blood cir-
culation and can cause ago-
nizing pain in these patients.”
For example, these symp-
toms are common in cases of 
vaso-occlusive crises in which 
sickle cells block blood ?ow to 
tissues.
In a paper published in the 
Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences this past 
December, titled, “Kinetics 
of sickle cell biorheology and 
implications for painful va-
soocclusive crisis,” the team 
discussed their in vitro model, 
which enables quantitative in-
vestigations of the kinetics of 
cell sickling, unsickling, and 
cell rheology.

vice “can detect the changes

PUGWASH COLUMN
LAINE HERRON
Special to the Tartan
At last week’s Pugwash 
meeting, the group examined 
the moral and social implica-
tions of practicing genetic engi-
neering in humans.
Last week, the United 
Kingdom approved the ?rst 
procedure involving the ma-
nipulation of human DNA. The 
procedure allows women with 
diseases encoded in their mito-
chondrial DNA to replace that 
DNA in their child’s embryo 
with healthy mitochondrial 
DNA from a third person. The 
procedure would result in the 
?rst children with DNA from 
more than two parents, and 
has highlighted a debate on if, 
and how, genetic modi?cation 
should be applied to humans.
Certain diseases, such as 
Huntington’s, sickle cell ane-
mia, hemophilia, and cystic 
?brosis, are caused by known 
genetic mutations. Is it morally 
responsible to allow children 
to be born with these diseases, 
when it is possible to detect 
and repair the genetic muta-
tions that cause them?
If genetically modifying hu-
mans is acceptable for prevent-
ing diseases, it raises the issue 
of who decides what is to be 
considered a disease. If certain 
genes were correlated with 
being gay, would it be accept-
able to choose whether those 
genes would be a part of your 
child? If preventing disease 
with genetic engineering is ac-
ceptable, is enhancing people 
beyond disease prevention also 
acceptable, and is there a clean 
line between the two? It is 
possible that genes correlated 
with lower rates of ADHD are 
also correlated with a higher 
overall focus. Similarly, genes 
that reduce the risk of mental 
retardation may also be corre-
lated with higher levels of intel-
ligence more generally.
Many members of the group 
expressed concern about the 
safety of modifying human’s 
DNA. 
The workings of DNA and 
gene expression are still not 
fully understood. Illustrative of 
this, the entire phenomenon of 
epigenetics was not discovered 
until recently. 
Before this point, scientists 
were unaware of the impor-
tance of structural details of 
DNA strands, besides their 
nucleotide sequence. Experi-
menting in new ?elds is in-
herently risky, because of the 
potential for unknowns. Ad-
ditionally, the potential nega-
tive rami?cations of geneti-
cally engineering humans are 
huge. Diseases unintentionally 
caused by genetic engineer-
ing would not only hurt the 
generation who received the 
intervention, but potentially 
all of their decedents. It may 
be worth being cautious when 
there is the potential of intro-
ducing new genetic disorders, 
such as Huntington’s disease, 
into our genetic pool.
Being able to choose only 
genes known to be bene?cial 
may also lead to decreased di-
versity in human DNA. Less 
diversity leaves us more open 
to the risk of widespread dis-
ease susceptibility, a potential 
catastrophe that played out 
during the great potato fam-
ine. With the loss of diversity, 
we might also lose out on the 
contributions of outliers in our 
civilization.
On a social level, human ge-
netic modi?cation also has the 
potential to relegate non-mod-
i?ed humans to second-class 
status. 
People without genetic 
modi?cation might be unable 
to compete with their modi?ed 
counterparts and might not be 
given equal consideration by 
schools and employers. This fu-
ture is examined memorably in 
the 1997 ?lm Gattaca.
However, even if the ben-
e?ts from the new technology 
are not equally distributed, the 
effects of a more capable work-
force might bene?t everyone. 
Also, such segregation might be 
short-lived, as genetic modi?ca-
tions become more affordable.
There is an abundance of is-
sues to consider regarding the 
potential bene?ts and dangers 
of human genetic engineer-
ing. As the technology is com-
ing closer to reality, it may be 
time to start discussing these 
questions.

Mankind has come a long 
way from communicating 
through landlines, to using 
smartphones for communica-
tion, information, entertain-
ment — you name it. Now 
imagine your smartphone, 
already capable of so much, 
functioning on a power sup-
ply equivalent to that used by 
a light bulb. Then imagine it 
performing computations at 
a rate equivalent to the hu-
man brain, with comparable 
arti?cial intelligence. This 
technology is en route to 
becoming a reality right this 
minute, in the Litt Lab of Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.
Duygu Kuzum, a postgrad-
uate in electrical engineering 
from Stanford University, is 
conducting groundbreaking 
research in the ?eld of neuro-
engineering, using what we 
know about nanoelectronics 
to simulate the chemical re-
actions that go on inside our 
brains. 
Last Tuesday, Kuzum was 
invited to Carnegie Mellon 
to speak about her current 
research as part of a seminar 
series hosted by the Biomedi-
cal Engineering Department 
of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology (CIT).
Recognized by the MIT 
Technology Review as an in-
novator under 35, Kuzum 
captivated her audience 
when she talked about how 
drastically her research could 
change the world we live in, 
in only a matter of years. 
She began by talking 
about humankind’s fascina-
tion with the human brain 
and by questioning the con-
cepts of perception, curiosity, 
intelligence, and the brain’s 
ability to store and process 
new information. Accord-
ing to her team, the world 
has got it all wrong. “Instead 
of trying to understanding 
the power of the mind, we 
need to understand how the 
neurons work,” Kuzum said. 
Her reasoning is simple: Just 
as a strong building needs a 
strong foundation, the secret 
behind the remarkable oper-
ation of the brain lies in the 
neurons.
Kuzum’s team is currently 
working on two projects, 
including synaptic electron-
ics for brain-inspired smart 
technology, and using the 
material graphene to build 
sustainable devices which 
can better help treat and de-
tect neurological disorders.
Synaptic electronics, ac-
cording to Kuzum, is one of 
the most innovative ways of 
simulating the brain without 
using as much power as a 
nuclear power plant. 
Taking her cue from how 
neurons communicate with-
in the human body (primar-
ily through synapses, which 
are connections between 
neurons through which in-
formation ?ows from one 
neuron to another), Kuzum’s 
team has manufactured syn-
aptic nanoelectronic devices 
which are capable of storing, 
processing, and relating in-
formation at the same speed 
as somatic neurons and at 
about one millionth of the 
power produced by a nuclear 
power plant. However, there 
is still a long way to go. These 
nanochips, consisting of na-
noelectronics representing 
close to a million neurons, 
still need to be trained to cre-
ate new intelligence, instead 
of only acting on learned 
material.
Kuzum’s team is also fo-
cusing on using graphene 
to build and simulate brain 
tissue, which can help scien-
tists better understand and 
determine the cause of vari-
ous neurological disorders 
and provide a solid founda-
tion for future treatments of 
those disorders. 
Graphene is a thin layer 
of pure carbon, the atoms of 
which are tightly bound to-
gether in a honeycomb-like 
lattice. The material’s struc-
ture, according to Kuzum’s 
work in lab, has properties 
which enable scientists to 
observe brain signals and 
patterns with minimal noise, 
helping optimize their re-
sults. In addition, graphene 
is extremely ?exible and re-
sistant to corrosion, proving 
useful in the production of 
surgical electrodes, which 
can be inserted within the 
cranium to simulate dam-
aged brain tissue or even 
to track disorders such as 
seizures.
The use of nanoelec-
tronics in the production of 
synaptic electronic devices 
and the use of graphene to 
simulate brain tissue can 
completely revolutionize 
mankind’s attempt to create 
arti?cial intelligence equiva-
lent to — even surpassing — 
the human brain. So far, the 
use of graphene has helped 
scientists observe patterns 
in neural signaling, but the 
material’s capabilities com-
bined with nanotechnology 
gives us hope that very soon 
we will be able to under-
stand and combat disorders 
like Parkinson’s disease and 
Alzheimer’s.

A panel of women who work at Capital One discussed various issues pertaining to women in technical ?elds. 
Panelists discuss diversity 
Not only are women not 
entering the tech ?eld at a 
comparable rate, but more 
than half are dropping out 
mid-career. “Back when I was 
in school, when we started 
this industry, most computer 
programmers were women. 
Now, 56 percent of women 
that go into tech are drop-
ping out — just when they’re 
trained and seasoned, when 
they’re ready to become fu-
ture leaders, they’re dropping 
out.”
This dropout rate can be 
due to any number of factors, 
the most obvious one being 
parenthood. Elberfeld shared 
her personal experience with 
the subject. “I’ve had to give 
up promotions, tell my bosses 
it just wasn’t the right time.” 
As a working mother of three 
kids, Elberfeld advocated for 
the option to work part-time 
and from home, and when she 
did it successfully, she went to 
the company’s management 
and advocated for other wom-
en in her former position.
“When you’re a coder, you 
can code from anywhere,” she 
said. “Being understanding 
of employees’ needs and ac-
commodating them will make 
them more loyal and hard-
working.” This holds true for 
the women of Capital One; 
four out of the ?ve panelists 
have been in the industry for 
at least ten years.
In addition to mother-
hood, the workplace environ-
ment and culture might have 
some bearing on the number 
of women leaving the tech in-
dustry. The discussion which 
followed Elberfeld’s presen-
tation focused largely on the 
subject of microaggressions: 
Small, unconscious biases 
which come out in our every-
day speech and mannerisms.
Each of the ?ve panelists 
spoke of their own experi-
ences with microaggression. 
“If there’s a note-taking role, 
or it’s time to buy presents 
during the holidays, since I’m 
the woman on the team, it’s 
just assumed that these are 
the kinds of things I’d want to 
do,” said Belinda Ragonese, a 
senior director at Capital One.
“Subtle sexism might 
end up making women feel 
ostracized over time,” said 
Elberfeld. “Eye contact can 
be huge. If we were having a 
meeting, and the subject shift-
ed to a big technical project 
we were working on, I could 
feel the eyes in the room shift 
to the men.” 
Katie Smith, a new addi-
tion to the ?eld of Android 
mobile development, added 
that “[People who are being 
subtly sexist] don’t recognize 
it. Bring it to their attention — 
the best thing is just to have a 
nice conversation.”
Perhaps the biggest piece 
of advice to emerging wom-
en in technology was to pick 
and choose when to envision 
oneself as “the woman in the 
room.” In one sense, being 
the only women on a team 
of technicians is a very im-
portant role. In other ways, it 
can be alienating. When there 
is a job better tackled by the 
female mind, tackle it. It is 
important for women to em-
brace their unique skill sets 
and bring them full-force to 
their workplaces. Gender-di-
versity breeds acceptance and 
breaks down social barriers, 
whether they are conscious 
or not.

Electric Guitars revolutionize music  
that converts physical sig-
nals into electrical signals. 
Surrounding the pickup is a 
stable electromagnetic ?eld, 
which can be disrupted by the 
vibration of a string at a spe-
ci?c frequency. For example, 
if you pluck a string that vi-
brates with a frequency of 400 
Hz, the pickup will receive a 
current of the same frequency. 
The electrical signal is then re-
layed to an ampli?er.
Pickups can come in differ-
ent forms, and are located at 
different parts of the guitar 
body. Some are single long 
magnets under all of the gui-
tar strings, while others have 
a single pole-like piece of 
magnet under each string. A 
guitarist can create a variety 
of different sounds using dif-
ferent pickups.
From the pickup coil, elec-
trical signals are sent through 
a simple circuit, with both 
wire and electric components. 
Circuits regulate the amount 
of ?owing electricity through 
components called resistors. 
One kind of resistor helps to 
?lter out speci?c frequen-
cies. Another kind of resistor 
regulates the amplitude, or 
volume, of the signal that gets 
sent to the jack, which is the 
connection between the gui-
tar and the ampli?er.
Generally, the electric gui-
tar itself does not consume 
any power. Instead, power is 
directed to an ampli?er, which 
is composed of three basic 
parts: a preampli?er, a power 
ampli?er, and a speaker.
Preampli?ers are neces-
sary to ensure that the electri-
cal signal is strong enough to 
be sent to the power ampli-
?ers. The power-ampli?ers 
then boost the signal in order 
for it to be strong enough to 
trigger the speaker. Without 
ampli?ers, an electric guitar 
would only be able to produce 
weak sounds.
Unlike a stereo ampli?er, 
the ampli?er of an electric 
guitar often distorts signals, 
creating the signature growl-
ing, edgy sound. Distortions 
occur when the electrical sig-
nals are too strong for the cir-
cuit. Whether the ampli?ers 
uses vacuum tubes or a tran-
sistor will also in?uence the 
distorting effect.
Also a transducer, the 
speaker will convert the elec-
trical signal into an audible 
sound. Inside a speaker an 
electromagnet is positioned in 
front of the permanent mag-
net. The electromagnet has 
the ability to move around 
while the permanent magnet 
remains in a ?xed position. 
As the electric pulses travel 
through coils of wire, the 
electromagnet vibrates back 
and forth due to rapidly al-
tering directions of the mag-
netic ?eld. The sound waves 
coming from these vibrations 
are further ampli?ed by an at-
tached cone, made of ?exible 
material. In turn, these am-
pli?ed vibrations create ?uc-
tuations in air pressure that 
pound against our eardrums, 
which results in the sensation 
of sound.
With the creation of elec-
tric guitars, you can now play 
the guitar at a signi?cantly 
higher volume. Combine the 
guitar with the intriguing ef-
fects of ampli?ers and speak-
ers, and you are left with 
a unique instrument that 
has helped to develop many 
genres, namely rock ‘n’ roll. 
Through its ability to pluck at 
human emotion, the electric 
guitar has provided limitless 
variations that have changed 
the face of American music.

occurs as the cells ?ow into 
low-oxygen conditions and 
give up oxygen, which allows 
us to study the red blood cell 
under ?ow conditions with 
low oxygen more closely 
than ever before,” said Kato, 
a member of the multidis-
ciplinary team. “With this 
new device, we were able to 
detect exquisitely the anti-
sickling effect of Aes-103, a 
new experimental agent we 
are testing in clinical trials, 
currently known under the 
name Bax-555. This shows 
that we can use this device to 
test new experimental anti-
sickling agents to look for 
drugs that can control sickle 
cell disease at its roots.”
In support of the device 
improving diagnostics of 
sickle cell disease, Ming Dao, 
part of the research team 
and principle research scien-
tist in MIT’s Department of 
Materials Science and Engi-
neering, stated, “Currently 
there is no reliable method 
for doctors to predict when 
vaso-occlusive painful crisis 
will happen, or how severe 
it may be. Our new device 
is capable of mimicking gas 
exchanges in human body 
in a controlled manner and 
quantifying cell sickling and 
impaired cell deformabil-
ity due to sickle cell disease. 
The methods developed and 
parameters measured in this 
study offer new ways for im-
proving diagnostics and for 
ef?ciently evaluating the ef-
fectiveness of anti-sickling 
drugs, such as FDA approved 
hydroxyurea or Aes-103 cur-
rently in phase II clinical 
trial.”
The team also presented 
evidence showing that this 
model could be used as a di-
agnostic indicator of disease 
severity. The team examined 
sickle hemoglobin (levels 
ranged from 64 percent to 
90.1 percent) from blood 
samples of 25 patients with 
sickle cell disease. Using 
these samples, the team in-
vestigated the correlations 
between cell biophysical al-
terations during blood ?ow 
and hematological param-
eters, sickle hemoglobin lev-
el, and hydroxyurea therapy. 
Based on their results, the 
team identi?ed two severe 
cases of sickle cell disease 
that were also independent-
ly identi?ed as severe using 
a genotype-based disease se-
verity classi?cation.
University President 
Subra Suresh was also a key 
member of the interdisci-
plinary team. 
Commenting on the 
importance of this work, 
Suresh said, “By bringing en-
gineering, biology and medi-
cine together with the design 
of micro?uidic devices with 
controlled microenviron-
ments, this work provides 
unique cell-level perspec-
tives of patho-physical pro-
cesses of sickle cell disease. 
It could lead to new diag-
nostic indicators of painful 
vaso-occlusive crisis and 
disease severity in sickle cell 
patients. This work could 
also facilitate supplemental 
pathways to improve clinical 
practices.”
Currently, the team is 
?ling a patent on the work 
presented in their paper. 
Research was funded by 
the National Institutes of 
Health and Carnegie Mellon 
University.

Johnny Manziel’s voluntary stint in rehab shows maturity
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
What would you do if you 
suddenly were given millions 
of dollars? This is the funda-
mental question asked of rook-
ie professional athletes every 
year. The NFL has some of the 
strictest requirements when it 
comes to who is eligible for the 
draft, mandating that players 
be at least three years out of 
high school before entering 
(after their redshirt sopho-
more or true junior seasons), 
but that still means that many 
NFL rookies are the same age 
if not younger than many of 
the students on Carnegie Mel-
lon’s campus. The MLB and 
NHL allow players fresh out 
of high school and the NBA re-
quires just one year of college 
before turning pro, leading to 
odd situations such as New 
Orleans Pelicans MVP candi-
date Anthony Davis being in 
his third year, dominating the 
league and on pace to break 
the record for most ef?cient 
season ever based on the Play-
er Ef?ciency Ranking (PER), 
being only 21.
I am con?dent that if I gave 
many of the undergraduate 
students here at Carnegie 
Mellon millions of dollars to 
go professional in a ?eld they 
have worked hard to be one 
of the best at (their major), 
most of them would instantly 
go wild and party for a while. 
They found their reward for 
years of hard work and ?nally 
get to reap the bene?ts, so why 
not enjoy it?
This behavior creates the 
dichotomy faced by many of 
the young players in profes-
sional sports. Society looks to 
at best, 21- and 22-year-old 
and, at worst, 17- and 18-year-
old role models and shoves 
them into the public spotlight. 
Johnny Manziel is the latest 
example of a star talent who 
society punished for overly 
enjoying the fame his talent 
provided.
Johnny “Football” has 
always had trouble staying 
within the law. Back in high 
school, his parents offered 
him a brand-new car if he 
could avoid drugs and alcohol 
during his junior and senior 
years as being the starting 
quarterback. Even with the 
large added incentive, Man-
ziel fell into the same trap that 
high schoolers from well-to-do 
families do, and quickly suc-
cumbed to the temptations 
and peer pressure of rebellion 
through alcohol. 
His parents took away the 
car, but it barely seemed to 
matter.
The same story was pres-
ent throughout his college ca-
reer at Texas A&M University, 
where Manziel’s star kept ris-
ing and — much to the cha-
grin of his parents — his no-
toriety of a party animal kept 
rising as well.
Leading up to the draft 
after his redshirt sophomore 
year, Manziel faced many 
questions about his immature 
habits, but did all the right 
things to convince teams of his 
newfound maturity. He man-
aged to convince the Cleve-
land Browns, at least, who 
took him with the 22nd overall 
pick in the ?rst round.
Right after the draft, how-
ever, the old Johnny ‘Football” 
emerged as pictures of him 
showing up to Vegas night-
clubs and incriminating pho-
tos implying cocaine usage 
turned up.
Manziel started the season 
on the bench and was demol-
ished in his two starts ending 
the season on injured reserve 
and the poor note of missing 
his injury treatment due to 
oversleeping from his party 
the night before. Last week, at 
the age of 22, Manziel checked 
in to rehab for, at a minimum, 
alcohol use. For most 22 year 
olds, the second semester of 
senior year is the last chance 
of partying and drinking be-
fore accepting responsibility, 
but here is Manziel in rehab 
with gallons of ink spilled 
writing about what a terrible 
role model he is and his lack of 
maturity.
I appreciate that profes-
sional athletes are blessed 
with an opportunity that few 
will ever come close to, and 
certainly have little room to 
complain, but at a certain 
point we need to step back and 
look at them as real humans. 
There are minimal expecta-
tions of a 22-year-old to be so-
ber on a Friday and Saturday 
night, much less lead a team 
of their seniors into battle 
against the top competition in 
the world on a weekly basis. 
The media has been hound-
ing Manziel for years, with 
the spotlight only intensifying 
after his Heisman Trophy win 
after his redshirt freshman 
year. But Manziel is still fun-
damentally a college kid, and 
he deserves a break.
We act as if he is some hor-
ribly irresponsible man, even 
though his largest crime is par-
tying too hard.
Sure he should have prob-
ably taken his job more seri-
ously, but most Americans, 
particularly those most critical 
of Manziel, do not give 100 
percent at their jobs every day. 
Men reach their physical peak 
well before their mental one, 
but society expects its young 
professional athletes to be at 
both before they are really at 
either.
I applaud Manziel for rec-
ognizing his ?aws and their 
increased magnitude in the 
current media spotlight, and 
taking action for trying to 
become the person society 
expects him to be regardless 
of the stigma associated with 
rehab. His decision shows true 
maturity.
Women’s Tennis
This weekend marked the 
beginning of the spring season 
for the seventh-ranked Carn-
egie Mellon women’s tennis 
team. On Friday, the Tartans 
took on Slippery Rock Uni-
versity at their home indoor 
facility in Monroeville and 
won 8–1. The next day, Carn-
egie Mellon faced off against 
Division I opponent Duquesne 
University and fell 6–1.
Against Slippery Rock, the 
Tartans started off strong, tak-
ing all three doubles matches 
with sophomore Vanessa Pa-
via and ?rst-year Stacy Chang 
teaming up for an 8–0 sweep 
in the third seed match. On the 
singles side, all ?ve Carnegie 
Mellon wins came in straight 
sets with ?rst-year Cori Sidell 
and Chang both winning 6–0, 
6-0, meaning Chang did not 
lose a single game during her 
entire match.
The following day, the Tar-
tans faced much stiffer com-
petition in Duquesne, and 
it showed. Pavia and Chang 
again won their doubles match 
but required a tiebreaker to do 
so, leaving the end score at 
9–7, and were the only Carn-
egie Mellon team to win their 
doubles match. In singles, 
most Tartans were able to put 
up a ?ght with three of the ?ve 
losses requiring a third set and 
Sidell defeating her opponent 
for the lone single win, 6–4, 
2–6, 6–3.
The Tartans next face off 
against St. Francis University 
on Friday evening.
Men’s Tennis
The ninth-ranked Carnegie 
Mellon men’s tennis team 
started their spring sea-
son against Duquesne on 
Saturday, ultimately failing to 
their Division I opponent 5–2.
The match started off 
rough with all three doubles 
teams failing quickly. Senior 
Bryce Beisswanger and junior 
Yuvraj Kumar put up the best 
?ght, pulling the score all the 
way to 8-6 in their defeat. 
Singles play went better — 
Two Tartans gained points for 
Carnegie Mellon, with sopho-
more Kenny Zheng winning 
in three sets 6–4, 1–6, 1–0 
(10–3) and fellow sophomore 
Kunal Wadwani putting up a 
dominant performance 6–1, 
6–1.
The men will be the second 
half of a double header with 
the women on Friday in their 
match against St. Francis.
Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s track and ?eld 
teams competed at the Bob 
Shannon Invitational hosted 
by Denison University on Sat-
urday. Both teams ?nished 
second behind Ohio Wesleyan 
in the ten team meet with the 
men losing 129–115 while the 
women lost 193–93.
In the track events, the 
men started off strong with 
junior Jeffrey Chen setting 
a school record with his ?rst 
place ?nish in the 60-meter 
run, ?nishing with a time of 
7.06. Senior Thomas Vanden-
berg continued his strong sea-
son with another win in the 
800-meter run with a time of 
1:54.03, over 8 seconds faster 
than second place.
In the distance events, the 
Tartans kept up the winning 
ways with sophomore Owen 
Norley taking ?rst in the mile 
run, crossing the line in a 
time of 4:26.16, and fellow 
sophomore Curtis Watro win-
ning the 3000-meter run in 
8:56.55. In the 5000-meter 
run, sophomore Gordon Pace 
took second out of team repre-
sented individuals with a time 
of 16:05.70.
On the women’s side, se-
nior Sasha Spalding took 
home a second place ?n-
ish in the 400-meter dash as 
she crossed the line at the 
1:00.06 mark. Fellow senior 
Erin Kiekhaefer set the meet 
record during her win in the 
800-meter run with her time 
of 2:21.20. In the mile run 
junior Priya Patel and sopho-
more Emily Joyce took second 
and third among af?liated 
runners with times of 5:51.95 
and 5:52.70 respectively.
For the ?eld events sopho-
more Rebecca Fortner took 
?rst in the high jump, clearing 
the 1.57 meter bar on her sec-
ond attempt. In the pole vault, 
sophomore Grace Yee lost the 
tiebreaker for second place 
by taking all three attempts 
to clear the 3.05 meter bar 
against her opponent’s two at-
tempts.
The Tartans will next com-
pete on Valentine’s Day at the 
Tif?n Dragon Open at Tif?n 
University.

Tartans’ basketball splits against Washington University
ANDY BIRLA
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon’s 
women’s basketball team had 
a very atypical start, compared 
with their previous home 
games of the season, in their 
game against the Washington 
University in St. Louis Bears. 
The Tartans struggled to ?nd a 
rhythm offensively, and were 
baf?ed defensively by the 
Bears’ ball circulation. This led 
to an early lead for the Bears, 
which they would hold on to 
for the rest of the game. The 
pace of the game was alarm-
ingly high, with some great 
hustle plays from both teams. 
Washington University played 
a full-court man-to-man de-
fense while the Tartans stuck 
to a more conservative zone 
defense. The Tartan’s lack of 
depth in their bench became 
clear as their starters began 
exhibiting signs of fatigue 
midway through the game. 
Carnegie Mellon’s sopho-
more center Lisa Murphy 
started and played the whole 
game alongside senior guard 
and captain, Chandler Cau-
?eld, who only took to the 
bench for a minute during the 
game.
This game was one of the 
rare occasions when Murphy 
was overpowered when re-
bounding, and only managed 
to grab 7 rebounds during the 
whole game. The Tartans were 
struggling to move the ball 
around in the ?rst half which 
led to multiple interceptions 
and forced mid-range shots. 
However it also opened the 
?oor for some brilliant indi-
vidual plays by junior guard 
Lindsay Poss and Cau?eld, 
both of whom were unstoppa-
ble from behind the arc. Poss 
shot an amazing 4–5 from 
three-point land and Cau?eld 
was not far behind, shoot-
ing 4–6. Towards the end of 
the half, the Tartans began to 
?ght back with multiple scor-
ing runs each cut short by the 
Bears’ timeouts, which suc-
cessfully killed the Tartans’ 
momentum.
At the start of the second 
half, the score was 43–24 
with Carnegie Mellon trail-
ing. Washington continued 
their penetrating offense and 
exploited the Tartans’ 2–3 
zone. Their offense was sys-
tematic: make continuous cir-
cular passes until the Tartans’ 
zone is scrambling and then 
get into an open position for a 
mid range jumper or a drive to 
the basket. Unfortunately for 
Carnegie Mellon, the women 
from Washington could not 
miss from mid-range as they 
kept expanding their lead, as 
shown by the night’s shooting 
stats. The Tartans shot a bril-
liant 12–21 from three point 
land but were restricted to 
10–33 on shots inside the arc. 
Washington could not 
match Carnegie Mellon’s 
three-point barrage, and had a 
skimpy 7–20 on three-pointers 
but more than made up for it 
with an average of 21–40 from 
the ?eld. The mid-range jump-
ers were the source of differ-
ence between the two teams in 
this game.
As the second half went 
on, Carnegie Mellon’s women 
were giving everything they 
had to ?nd their offensive 
stride, but kept falling short 
with forced shots and incom-
plete plays. Disheartening as 
those misses were, it seemed 
that the Tartans were begin-
ning to get into a passing 
groove as they ?nally seemed 
to be ?nding the space that 
had been eluding them all 
game long. Recognizing that 
the zone defense was caus-
ing bad double teams and a 
plethora of open spaces, the 
Tartans shifted to a more 
arduous man-to-man. This 
made a huge difference for 
the Tartans as it forced fewer 
double teams and made the 
Bears work for their baskets. 
The Bears could no longer ?nd 
open jumpers by just passing 
the ball around and had to 
move without the ball to get 
into scoring positions. The 
Tartans persistence was start-
ing to pay off as they improved 
their conversion rate late in 
the second half and started 
rallying behind Poss’ prowess. 
Kudos to the Tartans for their 
spirit to ?ght back and not lose 
hope (a quality that is much 
valued and needed at this 
university). They managed to 
close the lead to 10 points and 
ended the game 61–71. Poss 
ended the game with a team 
high 18 points with Murphy 
and Cau?eld both notching 12 
points apiece.
This game may have been 
a hard loss for the Tartans’ 
women, but there were bright 
spots for them that show great 
improvement: They ?nished 
strong (outscoring the Bears 
37–28) — something that has 
been lacking from their previ-
ous home games. They were 
also able to hold con?dence 
in the their shooting and im-
prove it mid-game — some-
thing that even professional 
athletes struggle with. This 
loss drops the Tartans to 11–8 
for the season.
The men’s basketball game 
started off much slower than 
the women’s, with both teams 
struggling to settle offensively, 
resulting in premature shots 
and unwise passes. Senior 
guard and captain Seth Cordts 
would lead the Tartans from 
the front by scoring the ?rst 
basket for the trailing Tartans. 
This was followed swiftly by 
a three pointer from behind 
the arc by junior center Blake 
Chasen, which gave Carnegie 
Mellon its ?rst lead of the 
game. The pace started to pick 
up around seven minutes into 
the game as both teams started 
to spread the ?oor more effec-
tively, getting into open spaces 
and ?nishing with good jump 
shots. The Tartans squandered 
their lead only once when 
the game was tied at 7–7, but 
never let up after that. The 
Tartans played a full court 
man-to-man which they car-
ried through with tremendous 
vigor and stamina. Midway 
through the ?rst half, sopho-
more forward Jack Serbin ex-
ploded, knocking down every-
thing from three pointers to 
baseline jump-shots, even ?n-
ishing at the basket from time 
to time. His teammates exhib-
ited a similar range as well, 
scoring from all parts of the 
court (something their female 
counterparts were unable to 
do). The Tartan’s big men ex-
ploited their size advantage 
and crashed the boards on de-
fense while posting up beauti-
fully on offense.
The Tartans were active 
on both sides of the ?oor and 
played a solid defense, tak-
ing away passes and forcing 
the Bears to work for the bas-
ket or give the ball up. Cordts 
was struggling to ?nd his shot 
from behind the arc but more 
than made up for it on defense 
by staying in front of his man 
through multiple screens on 
every play. There has never 
been a more appropriate use 
of the word suffocating than 
in describing the Tartans’ 
defense. 
They pressured their rivals 
continuously playing a tight 
defense and taking away every 
opportunity the Bears tried to 
create. This helped the Tar-
tans cause multiple turnovers 
but took away their offensive 
prowess as they slowed their 
pace. Cordts may have not 
had the best night from three 
point land, but the Bears made 
up for it by sending him to the 
line multiple times during the 
game — and Cordts doesn’t 
miss from the line. He ended 
the game shooting 14–14 on 
free throws with Carnegie 
Mellon as a whole not far be-
hind with 18–19 — talk about 
focusing on fundamentals. 
The half ended with Wash-
ington getting the ball to their 
post players for some tactful 
lay-ins, shortening the Tar-
tan’s lead to 30–22.
Although the ?rst half end-
ed with Washington threat-
ening to overtake Carnegie 
Mellon, from the very start 
of the second half the Tar-
tans dispelled any chances of 
that happening and were on 
?re with Serbin making three 
after three on back to back 
plays. If that wasn’t enough, 
Cordts ignited the court and 
the crowd when he ran from 
being knocked to the ?oor to 
put back one of Serbin’s rare 
missed threes. The tired Tar-
tans that closed out the ?rst 
half weren’t the same men in 
the second half. These men in 
white were on a mission, and 
they put their heads down 
and went to work. Sophomore 
center Chris Shkil was crucial 
in helping the Tartans run 
away with the game by being 
unstoppable in the paint and 
coming through at crucial 
points in the game.
Washington tried to mount 
a comeback several times dur-
ing the second half, but that 
back?red as it sent Cordts to 
work, scoring and assisting 
on multiple drives from the 
?eld. The Tartans were united 
in arms, played great team 
basketball, and expanded 
their lead to 21 points with 16 
minutes left in the game. The 
Bears’ point guard used his 
speed and court vision to get 
Washington a few open shots, 
but Washington’s conversion 
rate was falling as Carnegie 
Mellon’s rose. In the second 
half, the Tartans shot 14–27 
from the ?eld while Washing-
ton was held to 12–26. Carn-
egie Mellon had a few defen-
sive lapses late in the second 
half that lead to easy buckets 
for the Bears and gave away 
two steals that led to Wash-
ington fast breaks towards the 
end of the game. Normally, 
that would be enough to tip 
the momentum in favor of 
Washington, but it was Carn-
egie Mellon’s consistency and 
levelheadedness on offense  
that made sure that the Bears 
never saw the light of day. The 
game ended with the Tartans 
winning 72–59, and the crowd 
erupted, applauding the men 
as though they were heroes 
returning home from war. 
And indeed, with the excep-
tion of sweat instead of blood, 
they were heroes and they de-
fended the battle?eld of Skibo 
admirably.
Kudos to the three horse-
men — Cordts (22 points, 
a game high), Serbin (21 
points), and Shkil (17 points) 
— that led the Tartans to their 
victory. Free throws, three 
pointers, and post work: These 
men had it all, and were sup-
ported thoroughly by their 
teammates.
For in the end, it was Carn-
egie Mellon’s distribution of 
dependence and unity that 
won the day.

This year’s EOC to limit number of students in gymnasium 
BRADEN KELNER
Contributing Editor
As students prepare to ?ock 
Wiegand Gymnasium this 
week and try to earn a place 
among the employed, the Ca-
reer and Professional Devel-
opment Center (CPDC) has 
announced changes intended 
to improve the Employment 
Opportunities Conference ex-
perience (EOC), including an 
850-person cap on the number 
of students who can be in the 
gym at once.
The 850-person limit for 
the event, starting this year 
on Feb. 10 and 11 from noon 
to 5 p.m., was conceived as a 
result of conversations with 
Fire Safety Manager Rick Ca-
ruso, according to Associate 
Dean of Student Affairs for 
Career and Professional De-
velopment Kevin Monahan. 
Monahan said some members 
of the campus community, 
as well as potential employ-
ers, raised concerns over the 
number of people in the gym 
at once.
“I’ve been here for a year 
and a half and I’ve seen a 
handful of career fairs,” Mo-
nahan said. “And the staff of 
the [Jared L. Cohon University 
Center], myself, students, em-
ployers — we all saw that the 
events were overcrowded.”
Monahan said that, while 
no of?cial ordered the cap, 
those involved with conversa-
tion about the fair suspected 
that fewer people should have 
been in the gym at one time 
during previous career fairs. 
After Caruso conferred with 
the staff of the University Cen-
ter and members of the Career 
and Professional Development 
Center (CPDC) about the 
gym’s capacity, he determined 
the maximum capacity consid-
ering such factors as the num-
ber of exits and the square 
footage of the gym. Monahan 
said that, with an estimate of 
the employers and booths at 
the fair, the manager was able 
to determine the number of 
students allowed inside the fa-
cility at one time.
Speaking of wait times this 
year compared to previous 
years, Monahan said, “Usu-
ally, everybody goes into the 
gymnasium and then the wait 
times are waiting for employ-
ers. Since we’re only allowed 
to have 850 students in the 
gymnasium at any one time, 
naturally the lines for each em-
ployer are going to be shorter. 
Also with the concept that em-
ployers might be meeting with 
[a few] students at a time, that 
should also speed up their 
lines, and we’ve also asked 
employers not to do individual 
product demonstrations.”
Monahan explained that 
employers, in addition to 
not doing time-consuming 
demonstrations, have been 
asked to ?eld common ques-
tions amongst groups of stu-
dents, rather than individuals, 
if their lines become long.
“We also realized that this 
wasn’t a healthy environment 
to be so crowded,” Monahan 
said. “It’s not conducive to 
hold a conversation with a po-
tential employer when you are 
in a very uncomfortable situ-
ation because of crowds and 
heat and noise.”
Those facilitating the ca-
reer fair will ask students 
to move to Rangos 3, where 
CPDC Career Partners will be 
located this year, or wait out-
side the gym to enter once it 
reaches maximum capacity. 
The Career Partners will oc-
cupy 15 booths on the ?rst day 
of the career fair and include 
such companies as Bloomberg 
LP, Dropbox, and Facebook, 
among others.
There are 189 occupied 
booths at this year’s EOC, ac-
cording to lists of attending 
companies provided by the 
Career and Professional De-
velopment Center. The num-
ber of attending companies 
is less than the number of oc-
cupied booths because some 
companies attend both days or 
occupy more than one booth. 
Monahan said that the CPDC 
hopes to expand the physical 
space that the fair occupies 
in subsequent years to reduce 
crowding even further.
“We want to get students 
in there as quickly as possible, 
and we want them to have a 
good experience,” Monahan 
said. 
“But if and when [the gym 
reaches maximum capacity], 
we want to make sure that 
students are aware that this is 
for their safety and that when 
they do enter the fair space, 
it’s a more positive, healthy 
environment than what they 
might have experienced at 
past fairs.”
“It’s not conducive to hold a 
conversation with a potential 
employer when you are in a very 
uncomfortable situation because 
of crowds and heat and noise.”

Make the most of your EOC visit this week with these tips 
BRADEN KELNER
Contributing Editor
University career fairs can 
sometimes seem like mad-
houses, with hundreds of 
employers visiting each day 
and an even greater number 
of students passing through. 
Nevertheless, it’s important to 
remain collected and profes-
sional when presenting your-
self to the people who, hope-
fully, will soon be hiring you 
for a full-time position or sum-
mer internship. Here are ?ve 
things you should be sure to 
bring to the Employment Op-
portunities Conference (EOC) 
to make sure you strike the 
perfect ?rst impression.
The right attire
Looking like you know 
what you’re doing is half the 
battle at a career fair. To make 
your attire re?ect the con?-
dence employers want to see 
in candidates, stick to a formal 
dress code. For men, wear a 
business suit with a solid shirt 
or one that has a clean pattern. 
Tuck in your shirt, and wear a 
belt even if you don’t need 
one. Don’t forget a tie and a 
pair of black or brown shoes to 
?nish off your look.
For women, wear a suit or 
a skirt with a suit jacket. Stick 
to neutral colors like black 
or gray, and wear heels to 
complement the out?t. Both 
men and women should take 
the time to iron out wrinkles 
in your pants and shirt and 
to brush off any smudges that 
may be lingering on your jack-
et. As for hygiene, make sure 
your hair is cleaned up — cut 
and combed — and you look 
as if you got more than your 
fair share of sleep the night be-
fore, even if you haven’t.
Lists of companies to visit
Before attending the fair, 
visit the Career and Profes-
sional Development Center’s 
career fair webpages to view 
the companies coming to cam-
pus. Research companies that 
interest you and make a list of 
the ones that seem to be good 
?ts. 
For the companies you’re 
head over heels for, consider 
spicing up your résumé and 
making unique copies, rather 
than a general résumé, to fo-
cus on the qualities you know 
those companies are looking 
for. 
Hand your general résumé 
out to the companies you’re 
less interested in, but would 
still be happy to work for. By 
researching companies be-
forehand, you’re sure to make 
a better impression with re-
cruiters. Knowing a company’s 
work and how you can spe-
ci?cally help the company will 
de?nitely make you stand out 
from the rest of the pack.
A portfolio for résumés
Have a handful of résumés, 
but don’t know what to do 
with them? Take a trip to the 
University Bookstore to pick 
up a portfolio. These ?rm fold-
ers for your papers will round 
out your professional look.
Not only do they look sleek, 
but they also ensure that you 
won’t suffer any résumé sna-
fus, like dropping all your pa-
pers or accidentally handing a 
recruiter a unique résumé in-
tended for another company. 
These handy folders allow 
you to organize your résumés, 
and a list of references and 
samples of your work if your 
?eld typically requires those 
elements.
Portfolios are easy to tuck 
under your arm and walk 
with, and they also add to your 
air of professionalism while 
giving you something to do 
with your hands.
A water bottle and food
Career fairs can become 
packed and hectic. To give 
yourself some relief in your 
multiple layers of clothing, 
bring a water bottle. Take a 
drink of cool water if you’re 
feeling hot or overwhelmed. 
Staying hydrated will ensure 
that you are focused before 
you visit the companies that 
potentially hold your dream 
jobs. 
Before the fair, also make 
sure to eat. Sometimes, you 
may ?nd yourself waiting 
in unexpectedly long lines, 
which could cut into time al-
lotted for lunch after the fair. 
Even if the fair isn’t crowded, 
it’s always better to be over- 
rather than underprepared.
The right attitude
Remember that you’re at 
the career fair to land a job or 
internship. Act that way. Ap-
proach all recruiters as if you 
want nothing more than to 
work for their company. Greet 
them enthusiastically and 
shake their hand ?rmly.
Show them what quali-
?es you for a position at their 
company through an already 
prepared speech, but be sure 
to be ?exible in what you’ve 
prepared if the recruiter has 
other plans for your conversa-
tion. Be ready to answer some 
tough questions, and don’t 
break a sweat if you’re not able 
to adequately answer one. An-
swer it to the best of your abil-
ity and get ready for the next 
question. 
Ask the recruiter some 
questions yourself to show 
your interest and ensure that 
a position at the business is 
something you truly want to 
pursue. Thank the recruiter at 
the end of your conversation

It’s never too early to search for your dream job at the EOC
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Staffwriter
If you walk into the Uni-
versity Center Tuesday and 
Wednesday while taking the 
warmer route to class, you 
may feel out of place amongst 
an exceptionally well-dressed 
crowd, the likes of which are 
rarely seen on campus out-
side of the Tepper School of 
Business. It’s that time of year 
again: various companies are 
here this week for the Spring 
Employment Opportunities 
Conference (EOC), the semes-
ter’s largest career fair that 
will take place in the Wiegand 
Gymnasium in the Jared L. 
Cohon University Center from 
12–5 p.m.
If you’re a ?rst-year or 
sophomore, chances are that 
you’re not going. Perhaps you 
intended to go, but are now 
having second thoughts given 
the number of jobs that go to 
upperclass students. On the 
other hand, you may be going, 
but mainly for the swag — free 
stuff, for the uninitiated. Here 
are some better reasons to go to 
the EOC as an underclassman.
Nothing to lose
Take a moment to sit back 
and think about your dream 
job. I bet there will be at least 
one company at the EOC 
where you can get that job, or 
do something related that’s 
equally exciting. This semes-
ter’s EOC is one of the few 
events at which you’ll have 
absolutely nothing to lose 
by talking to recruiters. Your 
passion may even impress 
them enough to land you that 
dream summer job! You’ll nev-
er know if you don’t take the 
plunge.
Prep for future fairs
If you’re ?rmly convinced 
that there’s no way that the 
company of your choice will 
hire a freshman or sophomore, 
here’s a more practical reason 
to go to the EOC. 
Going to the EOC this year 
is good preparation for your 
following years at Carnegie 
Mellon. Attending this semes-
ter will allow you to feel what 
it’s like, so that you know what 
to expect as an upperclass 
student.
Simply walk up to the com-
pany that you’re eyeing for 
a job in the future, and chat 
with the recruiter. Ask about 
the company’s required quali-
?cations and interview pro-
cess, so that you know what 
they’re looking for and can be 
better prepared for the follow-
ing year, when you’re in the 
running for a job.
Small booths are hiring, 
too
While you’re at it, check 
out some of the smaller booths 
that none of the upperclass-
men are going to. Chatting 
with the recruiters there is less 
stressful — sometimes even 
fun — and can de?nitely boost 
your con?dence.
And remember, they’re hir-
ing too. So if they offer any op-
portunities you’re interested 
in, go for it! The odds of get-
ting that job are substantially 
higher and the company prob-
ably pays more than tradition-
al summer employers.
So, hunt out your nicest for-
mal clothes and be prepared to 
join the crowd of well-dressed 
students at the EOC. Draft a 
quick résumé — or update an 
existing one you have — and 
print out a few dozen copies. 
Make a name tag, dress nicely, 
and get ready to go.

Seasonally perfect confections
Gooey lava cupcakes warm even the coldest, most desolate soul
As if I had to restate the obvious, it is winter and 
it is miserable — especially around Valentine’s 
Day. I love to fight off the cold first with a warm 
bubble bath and then with something rich, hot, 
smooth, and mouthwatering: chocolate lava 
cakes. Nothing could be more satisfying than 
cutting open the mini cake with the side of a 
fork, then watching the molten middle spill out 
on to your plate. With every mouthful, you can 
feel your body getting warmer, starting in your 
stomach and radiating out to your fingers and 
toes. It’s delicious, it’s warm, and it’s perfect for 
this time of year.
Whether you’re making dinner for your 
sweetheart or celebrating Galentine’s Day (or the 
male equivalent) with your single friends, these 
fantastic little chocolate volcanoes are sure to 
impress, and with minimal effort! The process of 
making these is so simple you’ll be surprised by 
how quickly they’re done. 
Chocolate Lava Cakes
6 ounces of semi-sweet baking chocolate, 
chopped
1 stick plus 2 additional tablespoons of unsalted 
butter, cubed
3 whole eggs
3 egg yolks
1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, plus some extra for 
dusting
1/2 cup of flour
Cocoa powder for dusting
Real-life people with real-life kitchen equipment 
would make these cakes in these fancy things 
called ramekins, but since this is college and the 
standard is slightly lower, as long as you have a 
cupcake tin you’ll be just fine! This recipe makes 
about 9 cakes in the cupcake tin, depending on 
how you distribute the batter (or 6 cakes in 6 oz 
ramekins for real people). These are meant to be 
free-standing, so instead of cupcake liners, butter 
the walls of each cupcake well and sprinkle some 
cocoa powder around so the cake doesn’t stick. 
Also, don’t forget to preheat the oven to 450 
degrees!
Place all the chocolate and butter in a pot over 
fairly low heat. Stir it until it all melts and turns 
into this velvety, shiny chocolate sauce. Then 
pull it off the heat and let it cool for a little 
bit. Meanwhile, whisk together all of the eggs 
and powdered sugar. If you have access to a 
strainer, it would be a really great idea to push 
the powdered sugar through it. Powdered sugar 
tends to be a little lumpy, especially when it’s 
stored in more humid environments, and if you 
put it in the eggs without straining it, the lumps 
may never go away! After the sugar and eggs are 
incorporated, pour in the chocolate mixture and 
flour all at once. Stir this all up, and that’s the 
batter! 
Divide it equally between the 9-ish greased up 
cupcake wells and bake them for 12 minutes. 
After they come out, let them sit for around 3 
minutes, then take them out of the tins. If they’re 
a little bit stuck to the pan, run a knife along the 
sides to loosen them up and flip them out. These 
taste the best when you serve them fresh out 
of the oven, but it’s not the end of the world if 
they hang out over night. Just pop them in the 
microwave for about 30 seconds right before it’s 
time to serve. Garnish them with a sprinkle of 
powdered sugar, or even some caramel sauce or 
ice cream if you’re feeling adventurous! Finally, 
sit down, take a bite, and drift off into warm, 
chocolatey bliss.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I’ve never been bothered 
by cold. I’m from northern 
Vermont, and we’re much 
more worried about 
heroin addiction than 
blizzards. But I’ve never 
experienced such a dry 
climate as I have my first 
winter in Pittsburgh.
I’ve gone through entire 
bottles of moisturizer 
in days, my face has 
shriveled up beyond 
recognition, and I bought 
a different-colored neti 
pot for every day of the 
week. Even when I use 
toilet paper to wipe my 
makeup off my face every 
night, my skin is still as 
dry as… well, no, that’s a 
disgusting analogy.
Do you have any secrets 
on how to survive these 
terrible times?
Shriveledly, 
Lotion Is Keeping 
Everything Almost 
Reasonable, Although 
Inclement Situation Is Not 
Ideal, Need Therapeutic 
Help for Epidermis Soon, 
Until Nonessential
Dear LIKE A RAISIN IN 
THE SUN,
Well, you’ve at least got your 
nose and sinuses covered — 
most singers I know swear 
by the neti pot as devoutly 
as my friends freshman year 
swore by eating at least 
three bagels on a hangover 
morning, except neti pots 
actually work. I personally 
dip two fingers in my water 
bottle and stick them up my 
nostrils every five minutes, 
but if you’re a nut about 
keeping sanitary, then I 
guess that’s not a proper 
way to deal with a dry nose. 
So, good on you.
The bad news is that there’s 
no easy solution here. You 
could lug a bucket of water 
around with you everywhere 
you go and splash yourself 
periodically, but then 
everyone would want 
some, and the rest would 
evaporate before you knew 
it. You could spend every 
spare moment of your day in 
the University Center’s pool 
or sauna, but community 
pools personally turn me 
off — imagine how much 
pee is in there! — and when 
you eventually have to leave, 
you’ll be back to epidermal 
hell, this time with shriveled 
fingertips.
You could also hibernate 
through the winter. I 
personally view this as the 
best option: You get to sleep 
through the most fretful 
months of the school year, 
and I’m pretty sure it’s a 
viable excuse for missing 
class — unless those large, 
hairy, shambling creatures 
you see around campus 
aren’t actually bears.
Or move to Florida,
Evan Kahn

The Andy Warhol Museum opened Time Capsule 524 
in Warhol’s 610-part series last Friday. This “Out of the 
Box” event was led by Warhol Museum chief archivist 
Matt Wrbican and Time Capsules Cataloguer Erin Byrne 
in the Warhol museum’s small theater. The real star, 
however, was special guest Benjamin Liu. Liu worked 
with Warhol for many years as an assistant, and provided 
commentary on the various items as they were pulled 
from the box.
The purpose of the Out of the Box series is not to open 
individual boxes of the Time Capsules series for the ?rst 
time. They have already been cataloged and archived, 
and the documents and photos have been placed in 
Mylar sleeves inside of acid-free folders. Rather, the 
series is intended to show the box’s contents to the 
public, relive portions of Warhol’s life, and re?ect on the 
era. Liu had not seen the contents of the box before the 
event. He was likable and excited to see the things that 
“Andy” had left. It was fun to see him refer to his old 
friend so casually. He reminisced when they pulled out 
a bag with mementos from a tennis tournament they 
had attended together, and Liu told funny stories about 
their group of friends throughout the evening, including 
one story about ?ying across the country on a converted 
toilet seat in a Lear jet.
Time Capsule 524 documents September to November 
1984. Much of the contents were clothing, including 
special prints on t-shirts from Warhol’s contemporaries 
and members of his cohort. There were also letters and 
photos from friends and celebrities. Liu name-dropped so 
often that I lost count, and I only recognized one in every 
ten names or so. I did recognize Yoko Ono and Baron 
Philippe de Rothschild, both of whom had contributed 
items to this box, which is also one of the few with 
Warhol’s own writing on it.
While the subject matter was interesting, I found myself 
wishing the presentation had been more re?ned. The 
contents were gently unpacked by Byrne and handed 
to Liu, but the items were dif?cult to see from the 
audience, and Liu and Wrbican sometimes struggled to 
place them on the document camera. At times, Wrbican 
talked over Liu, and they often seemed to be competing 
in a weird way: Liu often responding from an anecdotal 
perspective, and Wrbican from a scholarly one. Still, 
Liu was entertaining and kept the mood light, and I 
appreciated what he had to say. Liu’s presence made the 
idea of Warhol’s life more believable, as much of the pop 
artist’s stories and experiences are extravagant and over-
the-top. It was reassuring to have them con?rmed by the 
anecdotes of a ?esh-and-blood person.
The Andy Warhol museum was open late, and the 
Time Capsule presentation’s audience was then able to 
venture through the many ?oors of Warhol’s own work, 
photographs, and information from the rest of his life. 
This was helpful for putting the items from the box in the 
context of Warhol’s own work, relationships, and lifestyle. 
It was also helpful because names that had been 
mentioned so frequently in the presentation seemed 
to be recurring in the Warhol narrative, and some were 
even members of his inner circle. For those who haven’t 
taken the trip to Warhol’s museum, I highly recommend 
it. Beside his artwork, the photographs of Warhol in 
studio at Carnegie Tech and hanging out in Schenley 
with his friends are eerie and completely cool.
Part of the charm of the time capsules is that Warhol 
compiled them without including much of his own work; 
they’re a collection of items he liked and thought were 
important. For instance, an album signed by the likes 
of Roseanne Cash and Elvis Costello was placed in the 
time capsule, as was a signed napkin from one of his 
favorite restaurants and a slew of Julio Iglesias Long 
Play records. In Warhol’s legacy, so much emphasis is 
placed on his own work that it was exciting to see his 
inspiration instead.

Warhol’s life illuminated by time capsule reveal
Presentation of artifacts from autumn 1984 gives Warhol enthusiasts further insights
Mementos from Andy Warhol’s journeys, such as this 
bag from a 1984 tennis tournament in Aspen, are the 
kinds of items placed in the time capsule.
Benjamin Liu shares funny stories about his time with 
Warhol as Matt Wrbican positions an artifact under the 
document camera.

My Fair Lady puts everyone in a good mood
Get down to O’Reilly Theatre for an evening of laughter, catchy music, and social commentary
Dear reader: I hate musicals. Their corniness, 
cheesiness, and general pep usually makes me want 
to run screaming from the theater. But the production 
of My Fair Lady currently showing in the O’Reilly 
Theatre, for all its froofy looking posters, is actually 
kick-ass. Do you like witty jokes? Do you like cleverly 
cloaked social commentary? Do you like stupidly 
catchy songs? If you said yes, no, or maybe to any of 
these questions then you should go buy your ticket 
right now. I’ll wait. Go. Right now.
Done? Good. If you had waited till the end of the 
article you may have missed it. Now that all that is 
taken care of we can get down to business. Anyway, 
you’re probably curious what you just signed up for.
As the curtain rises we meet Eliza Doolittle (Kimberly 
Doreen), a homeless flower seller outside Covent 
Gardens in London. As she peddles her sad flowers 
to the exiting opera attendees, we meet Colonel 
Pickering (John Little) and a curious man who seems 
to be an undercover cop watching the homeless. 
In fact this is Professor Henry Higgins, played by 
Benjamin Howes, who is analyzing the speech 
patterns of the London homeless. Colonel Pickering, 
also a professor of phonetics, enters into a bet with 
Higgins on whether the cocky Higgins can turn Eliza 
from a street rat to a duchess (and trick all the British 
aristocrats in the process). The rest of the musical 
consists of the hilarious failures and successes of 
their ambitious plan.
The set is fantastic, especially given the interesting 
arrangement of the O’Reilly Theatre. Because the 
theater lacked a curtain, all scene changes had to 
happen within the view of the audience. But in 
aristocratic England, what could be more fitting 
than butlers changing chairs as the characters move 
from Covent Gardens to Higgins’ home to Ascot 
and beyond? The two story wall of library books, 
which makes the backdrop, highlights the lightly 
intellectual nature of the show. The staging of the 
first scenes outside Covent Gardens seems a bit 
contrived, but as the musical progresses the actors 
develop an excellent rhythm and their movements 
become natural once they leave the first scene.
Little and Howes both shine as the colonel and the 
professor, respectively. Doreen, as Eliza, knocks 
it out of the park. She glides seamlessly between 
the many accents Eliza takes on throughout and 
continues these into the musical numbers. Speaking 
of the musical numbers, Doreen has one of those 
knock ‘em dead voices that shines in the role and 
makes “I Could Have Danced All Night” a smash hit. 
But Eliza’s ne’er-do-well father, played by Bill Nolte, 
almost steals the show. Nolte’s brilliant comedic 
timing and rich, deep vocals make the show go from 
really, really good to really, really, REALLY good. Like, 
really.
The rest of the ensemble is also smashing. Powerful 
vocals and subtle hilarity in their actions make 
you smile throughout, like the staging of “Ascot 
Gavotte,” which highlights the insanity of the British 
aristocrats. Part of what makes the performance so 
wonderful is that no one is safe, be it street rat or 
duchess, as the play makes a bit of a fool of everyone. 
In the process of providing the audience with 
aural and visual entertainment, as well as frequent 
comedy, the production brings up a brilliant social 
commentary just as accurate today as it would have 
been 60 years ago when it first hit the stage.
If you leave the show without a smile on your face I 
would consult a physician — your funny bone might 
be broken. Aren’t you glad you got your tickets 
already? You’re welcome.
My Fair Lady is in the O’Reilly Theatre until February 
22nd.

Before I left the U.S. for Italy I devoured every piece of 
advice about studying abroad. I had a plan for money 
— backup debit cards — and of course travel-sized 
bath items, so I was ready. But as my departure date 
got closer and closer I began to panic. What in the 
world was I doing? I don’t speak Italian! How am I 
supposed to get by, live, and thrive in Rome? It felt 
like freshman year all over again.
The most useful piece of advice I received was this: 
Expect everything to be completely different, and 
you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the similarities.
And that is exactly what I did. I got off the plane 
expecting to have landed in a place that was going to 
be completely unfamiliar — and it is, to an extent. I 
am excited every morning to be able to live and learn 
here in Rome, the birthplace of modern civilization, 
but the moments that have stood out to me so far are 
those that combine the unknown and the foreign with 
the familiar.
The Burger King just down the street from school is 
always packed at lunchtime with hordes of Italian 
high school students. Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” is 
strangely popular, and seems to be playing in every 
shop I walk into.
And then there’s maybe my favorite thing to relay 
back to the states: The street peddlers shoving “sel?e 
sticks” in my face whenever I get within ?fty feet of a 
tourist attraction.
This feeling of familiarity, of home, in a place so 
foreign can be hard to describe. You almost don’t 
realize it’s there until you run back into something 
quintessentially Roman, like the musicality of the 
Italian language surrounding you on the street, street 
markets selling everything from undergarments to 
vegetables, or the Colosseum appearing in front of 
you.
It’s been a month since I started this experience and 
already I still feel like I’m walking the line between 
tourist and resident. I want to take in every inch of the 
city, to get lost in its side streets, drink in its history, 
but I also want to live here — be a resident — and 
begin the process of becoming Roman, no matter how 
short my time as one may be.
These two wishes con?ict with each other. In order 
to be truly Roman, you can’t marvel at the city on 
your walk to school. To them, this city is home, is 
normal. They see no discrepancy in the combination 
of modern and ancient because to them the ancient is 
the modern. It is the backdrop of the bus ride to work, 
the everyday views on the way to the store.
And so I have found myself playing two parts. During 
the week I am the student, the everyday person living 
life in Rome. I take the metro; I take my cappuccino 
standing up at the counter; I grab un panino for lunch 
and eat dinner at 9 p.m.
On the weekends, though, I am the tourist. I walk the 
streets, only vaguely taking note of how to get back; 
I wear the headsets provided by tourist attractions; 
I acknowledge my surroundings as the marvels they 
are.
Little by little, in these four weeks, I have started 
to pick up the language of the everyday, enough to 
at least make an effort when buying groceries or 
paying for a meal. I have started to look past the big 
attractions that draw most people to the city and 
begun to see the smaller details that make it truly 
remarkable.
I think what I have realized most strongly since being 
in Rome is that in order to gain the most authentic 
experience, you have to play the part of visitor for 
a least a little while. The Romans don’t walk past 
ancient wonders because they don’t ?nd them 
interesting. They walk past them because they have 
the appreciation instilled in them, after a lifetime of 
walking past them.
Once you can be instilled with a fraction of that 
appreciation, you can be free to ?nd your own rhythm 
in the life of the city.

Ever since January, when all ten seasons of the classic ’90s 
sitcom were posted on Net?ix, a lot of people have been 
rediscovering Friends. I’m currently halfway through the 
second season, so I’ll include myself in that group.
As opposed to many now watching the show for the ?rst 
time, Friends has long held a special place in my heart. I 
often cite it as the ?rst television show I ever experienced 
featuring real, adult people with real, adult issues. I can’t 
exactly pinpoint when I started watching it with my mom 
on Thursday nights, since the ?rst episode aired in 1994, a 
year before I was born. But I do recall the airing of the ?nale 
ten years later, when I was about nine years old. My mom 
and I were two of 54.2 million American viewers of the 
single most popular television episode of the decade. Mom 
cried, and — even though I didn’t entirely understand what 
was going on — I remember that bittersweet sense of the 
end of an era.
Now, the era is experiencing a revival. College students 
everywhere are intimately acquainted with the joys of 
binge watching, and have capitalized on this opportunity 
Net?ix has provided to either return to an old love or ?gure 
out what the big deal with Friends was to begin with. 
With so many new initiates, the obvious question is this: 
How does Friends hold up, more than 20 years since its 
inception?
From my angle, it holds up pretty well. I was initially 
reluctant to click “play” on the pilot, as we all know the pain 
of a childhood favorite destroyed upon re-watching. To my 
pleasant surprise, Friends is still funny. When Chandler fails 
spectacularly with women or when Phoebe demonstrates 
her unique lyrical talents, I ?nd myself laughing along with 
the laugh track rather than scof?ng at it. I also still care 
about the characters — that core group of codependent 
20-somethings navigating careers, family issues, and 
complicated love lives. The premise sounds cliché in 
retrospect, but Friends was the ?rst sitcom to pull off the 
formula well. Even decades later, Friends remains a funny 
show with a lot of heart.
There are certain things that date Friends, expectedly. 
From brick-like cell phones to the museum-grade laptop 
that Chandler ?aunts, I’m reminded how far technology 
has come in the years since the show aired. The fashion is 
almost as much a blast from the past; I’m afraid my mother 
sported “The Rachel” hairdo through the ?rst half decade of 
the new millennia. This kind of anachronism is a hard thing 
for any show to avoid, since the more “modern” it attempts 
to be, the faster society will leave it behind.
A less forgivable hallmark of time gone by is Friends’ 
occasionally shocking moments of misogyny and 
homophobia, as many news sources have already observed. 
Though the show was progressive for the ’90s, it can 
be hard to stomach Chandler’s desperate attempts to 
manipulate women, Ross’s continuous devaluing of his ex-
wife’s lesbian relationship, or the running joke of Monica’s 
former “fatness.” While Joey and Chandler are equally 
women crazy, Joey maintains a kind of sweetness while 
Chandler’s bitterness often comes across more creepy than 
comical. Also, in what I would not cite as its most valuable 
cultural contribution, Friends is credited with popularizing 
the term “friendzone” in its ?rst season.
Ultimately, Friends is almost as much worth the watch as 
it was twenty years ago. Though some aspects are cringe 
worthy in retrospect, I’m glad to have revitalized my old 
friendship with a show that genuinely is timeless.

ABC’s new comedy series Fresh Off the Boat, an 
adaptation of the book that chef Eddie Huang wrote 
about his own experiences, premiered last Thursday. 
The star of the show is 11-year-old, rap-obsessed 
Eddie who faces difficulties assimilating into a pre-
dominantly Caucasian neighborhood after his family 
moves from Washington, D.C.’s Chinatown to Orlando, 
Florida. The show allows viewers to reminisce on their 
younger days (the show takes place in 1995 — that’s 
20 years ago!) and highlights the struggles that many 
immigrants face when coming into American society. 
Every immigrant faces the dilemma of retaining one’s 
culture, yet assimilating with the people around them, 
and this show really accents that dilemma through the 
tween experiences of the main character, Eddie. 
The parents in the show provide much of the comic 
relief, with the father portraying an extreme optimist 
in pursuit of the American dream and the mom’s car-
ing yet assertive attitude that emulates the average 
overbearing Asian mother.
The show addresses Asian-American struggles in a 
lighthearted manner, to raise the awareness of the dif-
ficulties and perseverance with no intention to offend 
viewers. What impresses me the most is that this show 
manages to share these experiences with the general 
public and add some racial humor into the mix. One 
of the highlights of the pilot episode was when Eddie 
gets into a fight with an African-American boy who 
has a 40-year-old best friend. The boy calls Eddie a 
racial slur in the middle of the cafeteria and Eddie 
decides to start a fight. The next scene shows Eddie 
sitting outside of the principal’s office with both of his 
parents discussing the situation with his principal. 
Eddie braces himself to hear his parents agree with 
the administration’s decision on his behavior, but they 
surprise him by standing up for their son. Yes, Eddie 
started the fight but didn’t the African-American boy 
first call him a slur? Why was Eddie the only kid sitting 
outside the principal’s office and not the both of them? 
In this episode, we learned that family always has your 
back and that you should always stand up for yourself. 
Fresh Off the Boat will be on ABC every Tuesday night 
at 8 p.m.; tune in to witness the fun!

Lunar Gala — the annual student-run, student-designed, 
and student-produced fashion show — pumped Wiegand 
Gymnasium full of fog and thumping beats on Saturday. 
The theme was Vestige, marked by broken-looking, 8-bit 
text and trippy, stuttering images on the screens behind 
the runway. The (admittedly very difficult to read) program 
was a list of the lines’ titles and designers in Vestige’s sig-
nature broken font.
This year’s models were top-notch, reflecting the hours of 
rehearsal dedicated to Lunar Gala since the beginning of 
the fall semester. The producers of the show also outdid 
themselves, with on-point lighting and evocative music.
Many of the lines in Vestige matched Lunar Gala’s tradi-
tionally edgy aesthetic, like one that featured industrial 
metal work inspired by the torture devices in the movie 
Saw, (“Mashinka” by human computer interaction and 
architecture double major Madeline Chen and fourth-year 
architecture major Jean Kim) or another that showed mod-
els with geometric, origami-like garments meant to mimic 
the interiors of geodes (“Lustre,” by third-year architecture 
majors Rehan Butt, Alyssa Hamilton, and Carolina Tamayo).
Other lines were impressively innovative, like sophomore 
costume design major Keith Kelly’s “Morph,” a line of three 
pieces, made of colorful molded plastic. “Menagerie,” by 
senior design major Jane Yoon, had models wearing black 
garments accented with gold and crowned by beautiful, 
animal-inspired headdresses.
Sometimes Vestige got a little too edgy for it’s own good — 
one line (“Uncover,” by math and art major Laurel Michel-
Schottman) was made up of business casual clothing for 
women with puzzling, transparent cutouts. Another line, 
“The Wealthy Slums,” by first-year undeclared Dietrich 
College student Lanre Adetola, took boho-chic perhaps too 
far with patchwork clothing that, according to the event’s 
program, was “the artful amassing of discarded clothing 
and fabric scraps.”
Some designers also trended toward whimsical and 
colorful, like senior design majors Emmy Hacker and 
Chanda Patel’s “Cakery,” which was “inspired by the 
elaborate shapes and decorations of high-end cakes.” 
Models in the line strutted to the beat of Fifth Harmony’s 
“Sledgehammer” — in contrast to the EDM and liquid dub-
step backing the rest of Vestige — and showed off their 
glitter-coated lips and jewel-toned outfits. “Mas-querade,” 
by senior design major Keith Joseph, was inspired by 
Trinidad’s carnival and had models in summery, brightly 
patterned dresses and shorts.
Lunar Gala also had interludes by several of the university’s 
dance troupes, including Soulstylz, Infra, and Bourgeois. 
The dancers did a good job with the unusual stage of the 
right-angle runway, and complemented the show’s theme.
This year’s Lunar Gala was, if possible, bigger and more 
hyped than last year’s show. It continued a long Carnegie 
Mellon tradition that lets students strut their stuff, literally.

Phipps Conservatory opens exhibit featuring the Congo
New exhibit educates visitors about the Congolese’s relationships with their natural environment
If you’re searching for a warm, exotic haven from Pittsburgh 
winter, look no further: This past weekend, Phipps Conservatory 
and Botanical Gardens said goodbye to its exhibit featuring 
Indian ?ora, and welcomed in its place the tropical forests of 
the Congo. Though the plants were truly phenomenal, they 
are not the number one highlight. The true star of the show is 
really the ingenious display of humans’ interactions with nature 
in the Congo. The signs explaining the surroundings that line 
the pathways through the exhibit highlight all the ways that 
the plants of the Congo are necessary for the survival of the 
indigenous people. They emphasize that to these tribes; trees, 
bushes, and ?owers are not just decoration; they are food, shelter, 
medicine, and tools. Educational stations along the way offer 
hands-on demonstrations showing how useful these plants can 
be. A market full of coffee, peanuts, plums, and other goods 
explains how their diets are almost entirely dependent on what 
grows around them. Further down the path, visitors ?nd an 
interactive exhibit showcasing two examples of typical shelters 
built from plants by the indigenous people. There, a volunteer 
points to a vine looped around the plant canopy. She explains that 
the people of the Baka tribe crush up the vine so that when they 
dip it in the water, it releases a chemical then prevents ?sh from 
absorbing any oxygen. They ?oat to the top and dinner is served.
The volunteer also explained that the entire exhibit — the 
product of years of research — came together in just a week. This 
room in Phipps Conservatory rotates exhibits only once every 
four years so that the rest of the time can be spent preparing for 
the next one. Years of studying both people and plants led up to a 
trip to Cameroon where Curator of Horticulture Ben Dunigan and 
Exhibit Coordinator Jordyn Melino spent time learning about the 
area. It was important for the accuracy of the exhibit that both 
Dunigan and Melino developed an intimate understanding of 
the region’s plant life and people. They then amassed seeds and 
plants from nurseries all over the country, and even some from 
Nigeria, to complete the collection of plants to display. Finally, 
teams spent the past week bringing it all together.
Phipps celebrated the opening with an array of activities and 
shows that accommodated visitors of all ages and interests. 
There were children in strollers, older people using walkers, 
and every age group in between. Every hour brought new 
fun including a drum show, a discussion on herbal medicine, 
and dance performances. Some attractions were available all 
throughout the day. There were masks to decorate, plants to pot, 
and food to sample, including some citrus water, coffee, bites of 
pineapple, and — the star — an authentic African Jambalaya. 
But you don’t need all the activities to appreciate the beauty of 
the exhibit. The next time you’re desperate to escape the tundra 
that is Pittsburgh in the winter, take a trip to Phipps — admission 
is free for Carnegie Mellon students — and treat yourself to an 
afternoon in the Congo.

This year’s Academy Award list of Best Actress 
nominees reads like a well worn catalogue of 
Hollywood’s most established talents. Nearly every 
leading lady in the running has been nominated for an 
Oscar before, and some have won as well. There is one 
exception to this trend though — Rosamund Pike. Pike 
was nominated for her stunning portrayal of Amy Elliot 
Dunne in Davd Fincher’s Gone Girl. Amy is a demanding 
character to play — serene, collected, and charming on 
the surface, but a narcissistic sociopath on the inside. 
Rosamund Pike is a stranger not just to the Academy 
Awards, but some would argue to Hollywood itself. As 
the emotional core of an all-lights-?ashing Hollywood 
juggernaut, she takes on a role that one would typically 
expect to go to an Angelina Jolie, or an Emily Blunt, or 
Pike’s co-nominee Reese Witherspoon. This makes it all 
the more remarkable, or perhaps explains why she plays 
Amy with the unique blend of subtlety and hysteria that 
she does.
Pike has had something of an on-off relationship with 
Hollywood for the past two decades. A natural actor right 
from the start, and incredibly bright to boot, she started 
her undergraduate education in English at Oxford, only 
to drop out halfway through and try for drama school. 
She returned to Oxford eventually, chastised by the 
entire experience, since no drama school wanted her.
Her next big brush with Hollywood was a few years 
later, when, out of nowhere, she was cast as Bond Girl 
Miranda Frost in 2002’s Die Another Day. An innocent 
newcomer to the industry, she was cast opposite Pierce 
Brosnan and Halle Berry in a commercial ?lm. This must 
have had a massive psychological impact on her highly 
impressionable recent-college-graduate self at the time.
One would assume she’d use a massive Bond movie 
as a launchpad into Hollywood central. Instead she 
did quite the opposite: She disappeared for nearly two 
years. Even when she returned in 2004, it was for a 
small independent Israeli ?lm called Promised Land. 
And thus Pike proceeded for nearly the next decade, 
taking on a small indie ?lm every once in a while, doing 
a documentary or two every now and then, and very 
occasionally taking on supporting roles in mainstream 
cinema such as 2005’s Pride & Prejudice, or 2012’s Jack 
Reacher. And even though she never entered the big 
leagues of Hollywood, she was always reputed as a 
brilliant actor, if not a star. For example, she received 
rave reviews for her performance as the stunning, if 
adorably silly, Helen in 2009’s An Education.
All of this changed, however, when David Fincher cast 
her in Gone Girl last year. Here she was, being asked by 
one of the greatest directors of the past decade to carry 
the emotional weight of one of his most challenging 
projects to date. To hear her say it, she was more 
surprised than anyone else at being cast. In an interview 
with The Guardian, she openly ponders why she 
deserved the role of “Amazing Amy” over the queue of 
higher pro?le actresses who would have traded a limb to 
be in her place.
Looking at her ?lmography, one can see her pulling off 
“cool and collected” Amy without breaking a sweat. Her 
natural porcelain features, not to mention her voice, can 
easily charm an audience, or her movie husband Nick 
(Ben Af?eck), into a peaceful trance. Where you really 
come to respect Rosamund Pike for her craft is further 
on in the movie, when circumstances force Amy into 
desperation, and into getting her hands dirty in ways 
she wasn’t planning on. Uptight, charming Amy is a 
direct re?ection of Pike’s own aloofness. When the charm 
recedes and is replaced by sociopathic narcissism, Pike 
really shines as she discovers a darker side of herself 
that I’d be inclined to believe she didn’t previously know 
about either.
Gone Girl is undoubtedly one of the coolest, most 
devastating movies of the year. And if box of?ce 
registers are to be believed, it is also one of the most 
successful, having made $368 million worldwide. 
Suddenly, a generation that had no idea who Rosamund 
Pike was is now eagerly watching her every move. After 
nearly two decades in the industry, Rosamund Pike has 
?nally arrived.
