Those close to 
Constant can’t 
reconcile crime
by Christopher Chung
THEHAREA NVRolu
To his students, he is a good- 
natured; enlightening professor. To 
his colleagues in the history depart­
ment he is unassuming, intelligent, 
and influential as a widely respected 
historian of science and technology. 
Edward Constant, an amiable man 
and long-time professor at Carnegie 
Mellon, is one of the more popular 
teachers at the University, and 
worked diligently over the last 25 
years, becoming 
an invaluable 
asset to both the 
History depart­
ment and the 
University.
But today, 
something else 
about Edward 
Constant over­
shadows his 
numerous THEARH Constant 
accomplishments:
he is charged with attempted murder.
It started exactly three months 
ago. On the evening of Sunday, May 
26, less than two weeks after campus 
emptied for the summer, Mt. 
Lebanon police responded to a call 
reporting a domestic disturbance at 
the home of Edward Constant and his 
wife Susan.
When Mt. Lebanon officers Daniel 
Rieg and Jeffrey Kite approached the 
house to investigate, police reports 
say, Constant and his wife were unco­
operative.
Eventually, Constant revealed a 
gun and shot Rieg in the chest — 
Rieg was not critically injured 
because he was wearing a bulletproof 
vest.
Constant was subdued, and both 
he and his wife were jailed after the 
encounter.
Within days of the incident, local 
newspapers published multiple sto­
ries about the Carnegie Mellon pro­
fessor who shot a police officer, and 
students and faculty at Carnegie 
Mellon were shocked: they could not 
understand how Constant •— their 
teacher, colleague, and friend — 
could have committed such a crime.
“He was a wonderful person,” said 
Ashley Campbell, a senior in informa­
tion systems, and a student of 
Constant’s during the spring of 2001. 
“Everyone in the class felt very 
strongly personally towards him. 
Which is why we were so surprised, 
because what we saw in the newspa­
per was so completely unlike the per­
son we saw in class.”
It seemed as if Constant’s personal­
ity and reputation could somehow 
make it all disappear.
“I was completely surprised,” said 
Sean Waters, a junior in information 
systems, who had Constant as a pro­
fessor for the past two semesters. “I 
was sure there had to have been 
some kind of mistake.”
It was the same in the History 
department.
“I was shocked, everyone was,” 
said David Hounshell, professor of 
technology and social change. “He’s 
a valued member of our department. 
His teaching is highly valued. He 
helps attract students to the depart-

Student raped at Gesling Saturday night
by Monica Datta
meeReoHEo 97.e NVRolu
Reluctance from administration to provide 
funding for safety improvements and 
increased vigilance from students in response 
to violent offenses have brought crime on cam­
pus into the limelight.
Several students have expressed concern to 
Campus Police and administration about safe­
ty and violence prevention at the University. In 
addition to campus shuttle and escort services, 
students have pushed for better lighting and 
for walking escorts through Safewalk.
At approximately 1 am Sunday morning, a 
female student was walking alone along the 
track in Gesling Stadium toward Resnik and 
West Wing, when she was grabbed from 
behind and sexually assaulted. The assailant 
was laast seen running across the stadium 
floor toward Beeler Street and was described 
as a 5'9" man wearing a long-sleeved white
turtleneck shirt, jeans, and a black ski mask.
Although the term seems to imply several 
sorts of sexual harassment, aggravated inde­
cent assault refers specifically to penetration, 
however slight, of the genitals or anus of a 
complainant with a part of the person's body 
for any purpose other than good faith medical, 
hygenic or law enforcement procedures.
The incident took place during orientation 
week, during which University police 
employed only standard fraternity coverage 
from 12 to 3 am.
The police were close-mouthed about the 
details surrounding the crime, declining to 
answer whether the victim was transported to 
a hospital and if police had any leads.
In 2000, 17 burglaries took place, opposed 
to 10 in 1999 and one in 1998. In addition to 
last year’s rape and the aggravated indecent 
assault of this past weekend, two incidents of 
sexual assault took place last February.
“It is critical for everyone on the campus to 
take these events seriously, both in keeping
themselves safe and in being supportive to oth­
ers,” says Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy at the time. Murphy and CMU Police 
Chief Creig Doyle stress the danger of walking 
home alone at night.
Students have requested of administration 
the installation of blue lights on emergency 
telephones. A committee, including Doyle, 
Murphy, and vice president of enrollment Bill 
Elliott is working for the installation of blue 
lights. There are thirty emergency telephones 
located throughout campus, several of which 
are marked by blue lights. These blue lights 
make telephones more visible.
Members of administration feels the project 
is expensive. “If the University allowed me to 
spend $100,000,1 would not use it to purchase 
blue lights,” says Elliott.
Last November, police and administration 
investigated implementation costs. Doyle 
reports the project to install blue lights to 
existing emergency telephones and to repaint 
all boxes would cost $42,166 and three weeks.
The cost would have also included a pedestal- 
mounted emergency phone to the rear 
entrance of Porter Hall on Frew Street. The 
second phase of the project will require 
$10,500 will add the same blue lights to interi­
or emergency phones.
The proposal has been submitted to admin­
istration, who cites funding as a major impedi­
ment in the progress. Elliott has cited a priori­
ty list of locations to install blue lights. At high­
est priority are the side of Porter Hall near 
Scaife Hall, the Panther Hollow Bridge near 
Hamburg Hall, and the extreme northwest 
corner of the Morewood parking lot where stu­
dents traverse woods to reach Fifth Avenue.
The University plans to contract Ramtech, a 
Rhode Island company that manufactures 
security devices including telephones.
Student body president Brian Namey 
encouraged the project.

imposed by Vice President for Enrollment Bill Elliott.

Two Carnegie Mellon seniors, 
Jeremy Nearhoof and Christopher 
Pierce, will appear before a judge 
this morning at 9 am in an attempt 
to delay a University sanction that 
bars them from eating, residing, or 
socializing on campus. Nearhoof 
and Pierce will contend that the 
University is unjustly punishing 
them for their role in a March 2 
early morning imbroglio at the cam­
pus quarters of art major William 
Kofmehl. The injunction, filed on 
Friday in the Court of Common
Pleas, also seriously impugns the 
integrity of the University 
Committee on Discipline (UDC), 
CMU’s internal and private judicial 
court. The brief purports that 
Carnegie Mellon’s disciplinary 
process was “unfair, prejudiced, and 
tainted” and blatantly ignored pub­
lished procedures and guidelines.
At the time of the incident, 
Kofmehl was garnering internation­
al attention for residing in a house 
he constructed on the side of 
Doherty Hall as part of a research 
project that involved a vow of 
silence, the donning of a lobster cos­
tume, and the filming of a movie as 
part of his performance art. In May,
the UDC found Nearhoof, Pierce 
and juniors Carmelo Piccione and 
Edward Woroniecki all equally 
guilty of four separate charges stem­
ming from the March incident.
Last Monday, three months after 
the UDC hearing and ten weeks 
after their appeal, Vice President for 
Enrollment William Elliott emailed 
the four a verdict that sustained the 
UDC’s original ruling but permitted 
the students to attend classes at 
CMU in fall 2002 provided they 
signed off on “social probation.” 
According to Piccione, he and 
Woroniecki have agreed to the 
University’s decision.
In the email outlining his judg­
ment, Elliott wrote that “social sus­
pension” meant “you are permitted 
on Carnegie Mellon property only 
for academic/business reasons.” 
Under the terms, none are permit­
ted to reside in their Delta Upsilon 
fraternity house, let alone partici­
pate in the house’s functions. The 
members had to vacate the premises 
by today. The University has agreed 
to provide temporary housing while 
the individuals search for a perma­
nent residence. In fact, prior to the 
suit, Nearhoof said the University 
offered several concessions includ­
ing scheduled dining hours.

GOP hubbub 
leaves little 
trace at CMU
by Cam Crews

In spite of criticism concerning 
research performed at Carnegie 
Mellon on behalf of the Republican 
Party, the University’s research poli­
cies remain unchanged to date.
State House Minority Leader H. 
William DeWeese, although “cha­
grined” about the University’s role in 
planning state redistricting maps, is 
satisfied with the. response from the 
University. DeWeese had been . a 
highly outspoken critic of the 
research since the Allentown 
Morning Call broke the story last 
spring.
“I have talked with CMU President 
Jared Cohon and his emissaries 
about this issue, and I have been 
assured that the university was 
unaware of the partisan nature of the 
project when it accepted the con­
tract,” said DeWeese in a statement 
issued to The Tartan.
Despite the assurance from the 
President, however, Mark Kamlet, 
University provost, who is heading 
the committee in charge of investi­
gating the matter, said that the 
University would likely take the same 
contract if offered it again. Even with 
the internal review process, the 
University's position is that the 
research project for the GOP went 
through due process.
“I would do a few things different­
ly in terms of procedure of character­
izing the work and making sure the 
parties knew what was going on,” 
said Kamlet.
Kamlet added, “We have to be vary 
careful about activities in which 
some of the information is propri­
etary.”
Charges by Democrats of corrupt 
partisan spending with state money 
have prompted an ongoing internal 
review of the process for approving 
research.
With a majority in the state con­
gress, the GOP had the duty to 
reform boundaries and eliminate two

Summit to be 
held in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
(AP) — Government officials, envi­
ronmental activists and business 
leaders promised Sunday the upcom­
ing World Summit on Sustainable 
Development will be about action — 
not just words — to save the environ­
ment and combat poverty. But some 
Activists fear the world’s wealthiest 
nations could sabotage any meaning­
ful attempt to build on agreements 
adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Brazil.
The 10-day summit, which starts 
Monday, hopes to halve the more 
than 1 billion people without access 
To clean water and the more than 2 
'billion without proper sanitation. It 
;aims to develop specific plans for 
'expanding the poor’s access to elec- 
ftricity and health care, to reverse the 
¦degradation of agricultural land and 
to protect the global environment.
But many environmental activists 
were disheartened that President 
Bush was not among the more than 
1100 world leaders scheduled to 
!attend. They also blamed much of the 
; difficulty in reaching agreement on 
the United States’ resistance to set- 
Iting specific targets and its demands 
that poor nations show good gover­
nance before receiving financial aid.
: The EU has also been criticized for 
refusing to drop subsidies that protect 
domestic industries and agriculture, 
an issue that infuriates developing 
nations struggling to get access to 
European markets.
Negotiators met in special pre-sum­
mit sessions Saturday and Sunday to 
try to resolve some of the contentious 
issues. US and European officials said 
they were optimistic a deal could be 
reached.
Many activists have lamented an 
“implementation gap” between the 
qommitments made at the Earth 
Summit in Brazil in 1992 and the gov- 
.ernments’ inaction to achieve those 
environmental and development 
goals.

liaison to the summit. He said that

Farmer’s Almanac 
predicts warmth
LEWISTON, Maine (AP) — If last 
winter’s mild weather kept your snow 
shovel buried beneath beach towels 
and tanning butter, the Farmers’ 
Almanac recommends dusting it off 
this fall. Folks from Maine to 
Colorado can expect heavy snow and 
colder-than-normal temperatures, 
according to ths year’s edition.
“We are predicting a rough winter, 
with severe weather patterns that 
gradually shift eastward as the winter 
progresses,”’ recently wrote Caleb 
Weatherbee, the pseudonym used by 
the almanac’s forecaster. The 186- 
year-old almanac, which goes on sale 
Tuesday, made similar prognostica­
tions last winter. Those predictions 
were mostly wrong.
It forecast several feet of snow last 
year for New England, but the region 
had warmer-than-normal tempera­
tures, the toastiest winter ever 
recorded in Portland, Maine, and 
Burlington, Vt., and a dearth of snow.
Perhaps the editors can be forgiv­
en: Between La Ninas and El Ninos, 
and talk of climatic change, there has 
been some weird weather, including 
droughts in the United States and 
flooding in Europe.
The winter forecasts, which date 
back to Benjamin Franklin’s Poor 
Richard’s Almanac in the mid-1700s, 
have become a signpost of 
Americana.
Fretting about their accuracy 
seems almost beside the point.
Such judgments don’t seem to faze 
the publication’s editor, who says 
long-range predictions fill an impor­
tant niche.
When the Farmers’ Almanac, not to 
be confused with the Old Farmer’s 
Almanac in New Hampshire, began 
publishing in 1818, almanacs provid­
ed the only weather forecasts avail­
able. Back then, the predictions were 
used mostly by farmers. Nowadays, 
they may be used more often to pick 
wedding dates, said editor Peter 
Geiger.
Hatfill complains 
about FBI probe
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) —The 
biowarfare expert under scrutiny in 
the anthrax attacks says the FBI has 
accepted his offer to undergo a blood 
test he says will prove his innocence.
• FBI agents are trying to determine 
whether anyone saw Hatfill last 
September or October near a mailbox 
where authorities believe the anthrax 
letters were mailed.
Hatfill provided reporters with 
copies of what he said were 
timesheets for CIA contractor Science 
Applications International Corp., 
where he was working last year, that 
he said proved he could not have 
mailed the mentioned letters. The 
timesheets show Hatfill worked over­
time on the days the letters would 
have been mailed, September 17 and 
18 and October 8 and 9 which Hatfill 
said would have precluded a 
roundtrip from SAIC offices in subur­
ban McClean, Va., to central New 
Jersey.
SAIC spokesmen were unavailable 
to comment on the authenticity of the 
timesheets, or whether Hatfill could 
have left the building without clock­
ing out.
Hatfill was fired from SAIC last 
year under circumstances neither 
side has been willing to explain, 
although Hatfill says the firing has 
nothing to do with the anthrax inves­
tigation.
Investigators have searched his 
Frederick, Md., apartment twice, 
including testing for anthrax residue, 
as well as his car, a storage unit in 
Florida, and his girlfriend’s home. 
They have seized his computer and 
bags of personal items he had thrown 
away.
toward those goals. South African 
Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini- 
Zuma said Sunday that orderly, 
authorized protests would be wel­
comed, but illegal demonstrations 
would not be tolerated.
Despite the lack of strong action in 
the past decade, the Rio conference 
was vitally important because it 
changed the world’s attitude to the 
environment, said Nitin Desai, secre­
tary-general of the summit. This con­
ference must now turn that into con­
crete commitments to tackle poverty 
and protect the planet, Desai said.
Afghanistan to 
release prisoners
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — 
Afghan authorities are considering 
releasing hundreds of foreign prison­
ers, many of them suspected Al Qaida 
fighters, but those guarding them 
argue the men are still dangerous ter­
rorists who should remain behind 
bars. In the basement of the intelli­
gence ministry building in Kabul, 
some 50 bearded prisoners sit bare­
foot, up to seven to a room, reading 
the Qur’an and praying. Most are 
Pakistanis; a few are from neighbor­
ing Tajikistan.
The government has yet to give an 
exact count of how many foreigners 
have been captured, but Caroline 
Douilliez, a spokeswoman for the 
International Committee of the Red 
Cross, said Afghanistan’s jails house 
at least 2,500 foreign detainees from 
30 different countries. Another 70 
foreigners were also being held at US 
jails in Bagram and Kandahar, she 
said. A US diplomat, speaking on con­
dition of anonymity, said the remain­
ing prisoners were small fry. “They 
may be extremists in their views, but 
no one considers these important 
people,” he said.
During a visit to Kabul in April, 
Pakistan President Gen. Pervez 
Musharraf asked President Hamid 
Karzai to release detained Pakistanis. 
Shortly afterward, several dozen 
Pakistani prisoners were handed over 
to authorities in Pakistan, but hun­
dreds remain in custody.
Foreign Minister Abdullah said the ^ 
fate of the prisoners would be decid­
ed on a case-by-case basis. Those with 
no known links to terrorists and who 
have not been accused of human 
rights violations would likely be 
released at some point on “humani­
tarian” grounds.”
Abdullah said a group of prisoners 
would probably be handed over to 
Pakistani authorities “in a few days.”

Alcohol raises 
attraction factor
(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, T.X. — A 
recent alcohol study by two 
Scottish universities found that 
beauty may be in the eye of the 
drunken beholder. The effect of 
alcohol on the brain’s “pleasure 
path” may explain the so-called 
“beer goggles effect,” or why drink­
ing can make people more attract­
ed to each other.
Barry Jones, of the University of 
Glasgow, and Ben Jones, of St. 
Andrews University, presented 80 
students from the University of 
Glasgow with color photographs of 
120 students from St. Andrews. 
The researchers then asked the stu­
dents to rate the attractiveness of 
the photos on a seven-point scale— 
one being highly unattractive, 
seven being highly attractive.
The researchers found that after 
about one or two drinks, men and 
women were 25 percent more like­
ly to find faces of the opposite sex 
attractive. In the study, to be pre­
sented at the International 
Congress on Behavioral Medicine 
in Finland next week, the 
researchers suggest that alcohol 
stimulates the nucleus accumbens, 
the part of the brain used to mea­
sure facial attractiveness. The stim­
ulation of the nucleus accumbens is 
equal for men and women, even 
though other studies have shown 
that women’s susceptibility to the 
effects of alcohol is greater than
that of men. Whatever the suscepti­
bility, Julie Gerber of the American 
Council for Drug Education said that 
men and women should exercise 
responsibility when they drink. The 
ACDE, which runs a Web site called 
“Facts on Tape,” estimates that 
among students involved in “acquain­
tance rape,” 55 percent of women 
and 75 percent of men were drinking 
or using drugs at the time of the rape. 
As many as 70 percent of college stu­
dents admit to having engaged in sex 
because of alcohol.
Erickson said the research seems to 
add to our understanding about the 
way alcohol inhibits judgment and 
may provide a reason why people 
engage in risk-taking behavior.
Chuck Roper, a coordinator for 
alcohol and drug education at 
University Health Services, said most 
people recognize that alcohol lowers 
inhibitions. Roper said he advises stu­
dents to act responsibly when they 
drink, to plan their evenings before 
they go out by writing plans down 
and taking the list with them.

Michael Munger, chair of the

UNC has a clear right to assign the 
reading and that the state 
Legislature has a right to cut fund­
ing, but that the more important 
question is whether their actions 
are in pursuit of the best interest of 
the University.
“I have some recollection of 
what it was like to be at the mercy 
of the State Legislature,” said 
Munger, who taught at UNC for 
seven years. “UNC’s going through 
difficult budget times, and a lot of 
people don’t really like UNC pro­
fessors, and the idea that they were 
going to subject little Johnny from 
Goldsboro to their twisted version 
of what religion might be was very 
upsetting to some people.”
He said the Legislature, in 
demonstrating that it is willing to 
interfere and micromanage the 
university, is severely harming 
UNC’s reputation. Stanley 
Hauerwas, professor of theological 
ethics, said that if the reading were 
based on the Bible, there would 
have been very little uproar. “They 
say they’re upset because ... the 
book [omits] the allegedly more 
militaristic passages of the 
Qur’an,” he said. “I think people 
might get upset if you read them 
the more militaristic passages of 
the Bible.”
Despite doubts, 
Adams released
James Starr Adams was released 
from the Allegheny County Jail Aug. 
14 although two documents at the 
facility alerted officials to hold him.
While Adams made arrangements 
to be bailed out, paperwork sitting on 
a desk in an adjacent room ordered 
him to be detained on a 1999 parole 
violation even if someone posted his 
bond. That document was not discov­
ered until an hour after Adams 
walked free.
Luckily for police, Adams, 29, of 
Lincoln-Lemington, surrendered a 
few days later. But detectives, togeth­
er with the jail’s internal affairs divi­
sion, are still investigating his mistak­
en release, and changes in jail proce­
dure already have been made.
“Everybody did their job. It was 
just a loophole in the 
system,"’’Executive Deputy Warden 
James Gregg said. “This is the first 
time it happened in seven years with 
the hundreds of thousands of inmates 
who go through there.”
Nevertheless, the loophole that 
Adams exposed was obvious enough 
that a consultant identified it just last 
month in a report to county Manager 
Bob Webb.
“Any circumstance that leads to a 
premature release has to be exten­
sively investigated,” Webb said. “I 
want to make clear the fact that any 
circumstance, including this one, is 
not taken lightly.”
One reason for Adams’ release con­
cerns glitches in the flow of paper­
work from several agencies, an inves­
tigation by the Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette determined.
But another factor was that Adams, 
like thousands of others arrested 
each year, was formally charged in 
front of a magistrate before his identi­
ty had been verified.
Also like many prisoners, Adams 
gave authorities a false name, telling 
them he was William Morris.
Waynesburg train 
engineer sues
Train engineer Melanie Austin 
called them the “Good Old Boys 
Network.” They were her male co­
workers at Conrail and Norfolk 
Southern, including her former lover 
and fellow engineer, Dennis Wagner, 
with whom she said she had a "twist­
ed, volatile relationship."
After it ended in August 1998, the 
sexual harassment she said she had 
endured for years from railroad men 
escalated.
The rough railroaders wrote sexual 
graffiti about her on the walls of loco­
motives, called her “psycho bitch” on 
the train radio and once, she said, 
even hung a pair of her underwear on 
a stick and waved them from a train.
After lodging various complaints 
with management, Austin ultimately 
filed a federal lawsuit against the rail­
roads, and this week a jury awarded 
her $450,000 after a three-day trial 
before U.S. District Judge Robert 
Cindrich.
“It was a nice verdict considering 
that what the railroad offered [as a 
settlement] was laughable,” said 
Austin's lawyer, Zan Ivan Hodzic.
Looking Ahead
Ip President Bush may be coming 
to Pittsburgh on Labor Day to 
speak at a carpenter’s union training 
center on Neville Island, but security 
concerns will deter him from march­
ing in the annual Labor Day Parade, 
downtown.
Jack Brooks, secretary/treasurer of 
the Brotherhood of Carpenters and 
Joiners of America, said the president 
is expected to speak in the early after­
noon at the training site.
China’s Communist Party has 
chosen November 8 as the start­
ing date for the 16th Party Congress 
at which the fate of a critical leader­
ship succession will be decided, state 
media said on Sunday.
Communist Party Chief Jiang 
Zemin and other leaders over the age 
of 70 are due to step down at the con­
gress, although rumors say Jiang 
wants to remain as head of the party 
rather than hand power over to his 
designated heir.
H State Department security offi­
cers will begin providing the 
inner ring of bodyguards for 
President Hamid Karzai in
September, as they take over that job 
from United States Special 
Operations forces, American and 
Afghan officials announced today.
The American military will contin­
ue to assign forces to form what one 
official in Kabul called”the outer ring 
of security” for Mr. Karzai.
Scientists take 
gander at geese
SIX Irish light-bellied brent 
geese, fitted with £3,000 electron­
ic transmitters to chart their 
migration by satellite, are having a 
rough time of it. One of them was 
traced to an Eskimo hunter’s freez­
er. The birds were fitted with 
transponders in Iceland last May 
by the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust, 
but bleeps from Arnthor stopped 
abruptly over Disko Island, off the 
west coast of Greenland, where 
hunting is illegal during spring 
migration but still takes place. 
Then Oscar died in Iceland; his 
body was found on a small island 
there. Researchers think he may 
have fallen victim to a bird of prey.
Now the wildlife experts are 
mourning a third goose, Kerry, 
tracked to a precise site on remote 
Cornwallis Island. Unfortunately, 
the site was an Eskimo hunter’s 
kitchen freezer. Kerry had com­
pleted an arduous 4,500-mile jour­
ney, when the transponder signals 
showed he had come to rest.
A Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust 
senior research officer, Dr James 
Robinson, said yesterday: “We 
have Canadian colleagues in 
Resolute Bay on Cornwallis Island 
who have a small receiver which 
can pick up the birds’ signal. They 
decided to see if they could find 
him. They looked in all the fjords 
and lakes where brent geese go, 
but had no success at all. Then, as 
they were walking back into town, 
their receiver started beeping
more strongly. They tracked the 
beeps to a house, knocked on the 
door, and discovered that the guy 
who lived there had shot Kerry on 
another island called Bathurst 
Island.
“Kerry was in the hunter’s freez­
er. He hadn’t been plucked and the 
transponder was still on him. The 
hunter was somewhat surprised. 
He didn’t know what the device on 
the goose’s back was.”
The three remaining geese are 
still thought to be alive. Austin is 
on Ellesmere Island, Hugh was last 
heard of on Amund Ringnes 
Island, and Major Ruttledge is 
believed to be on Graham Island.
Dr Robinson said Kerry had 
been supported by about 15 
adopters. They will now be invited 
to switch to one of the birds whose 
goose has not already been 
cooked.
Surveyed Britons 
deify Jedi Knight
When asked their religious affil­
iation on the 2001 census forms, 
many Britons are writing in “Jedi 
Knight,” government officials said 
Wednesday.
So many, in fact, that the gov­
ernment has been forced to give 
“Jedi Knight” its own category 
when compiling census results.
Jedi Knight was given its own 
code in processing the census 
forms because a large group of 
people entered it, an Office for 
National Statistics spokesman said 
on condition of anonymity. He 
added that the office was not say­
ing that Jedi Knight is an official 
religion.

CGS premieres 
two certificates
The University of Pittsburgh’s 
College of General Studies (CGS) is 
offering two new health services 
certificate programs beginning in 
Fall 2002 designed to help health 
professionals, with or without a 
bachelor’s degree, to improve their 
skills and advance in their fields.
Each of the two new programs— 
Managing Health Services 
Programs and Projects, and 
Community Health Assessment— 
comprises six courses for 18 credits. 
The two curricula were developed 
by university faculty, with consulta­
tion from advisors within the com­
munity and the health industry, and 
were designed to allow students to 
improve their communication and 
management skills and their knowl­
edge of the health field. Credits 
earned through the certificate pro­
grams can also be applied to the 
Bachelor of Arts degree in health 
services.
“This is a new market for the 
College of General Studies,” says 
CGS Dean Susan R. Kinsey. 
“Research shows that employers are 
increasingly inclined to invest in 
short-term education and will use 
their continuing education dollars 
to send employees to programs such 
as these.”| $Engineers praised 
for “Green Steel”
The Engineers’ Society of Western 
Pennsylvania (ESWP) will honor 
University of Pittsburgh engineering 
Professors Anthony DeArdo and 
Isaac Garcia with the ESWP’s 
“Outstanding Engineering
Achievement Award” for developing 
lead-free steel. They will receive the 
award at the ESWP’s Annual 
Banquet on February 20.
DeArdo, William Kepler 
Whiteford professor of Materials 
Science and Engineering, and 
Garcia, associate research professor 
of materials science and engineer­
ing, developed the “green” steel by 
replacing lead with tin. Lead, a 
toxin, has been added to steel to 
make it easier to cut. Eliminating 
lead made the process more envi­
ronmentally friendly.
Night ceremonies 
take place at Pitt
The University of Pittsburgh held 
its eighty-second annual Lantern 
Night for first-year women and 
Night of the Panther ceremonies for 
first-year men Sunday, August 25. 
This year, parents and grandparents 
of students who previously attended 
the university and participated in 
the ceremonies were invited to par­
ticipate in the ceremonies. The 
women carried unlit lanterns to the 
ceremony in Alumni Hall and left 
with lit lanterns to the Commons 
Room for a reception with Night of 
the Panther participants. Men 
received symbolic Panther pins.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg 
gave the University address at the 
Lantern Night event and Valerie 
McDonald Roberts, a former 
Pittsburgh councilwoman who 
earned both her bachelor’s and mas­
ter’s degrees at the University of 
Pittsburgh gave the Freshman 
Address to women. Keith Schaefer, 
class of 1971, gave the Alumni wel­
come to men, and Velma 
Scantlebury, associate professor of 
surgery at the University’s medical 
school, gave the Freshman Address 
to first-year men. The Alumnae 
Council of the Pitt Alumni 
Association and Pitt’s Office of 
Student Life cosponsor Lantern 
Night, and Pitt’s Division of Student 
Affairs and the Pitt Alumni 
Association cosponsor the Night of 
the Panther ceremony.
University reaches 
fundraising goal
The University of Pittsburgh’s 
“Discover a World of Possibilities” six- 
year fundraising campaign exceeded 
its $500 million dollar goal more than 
a year before its scheduled conclu­
sion. Pitt’s Board of Trustees passed a 
resolution at its June 20 meeting to 
authorize the university to extend the 
campaign by four additional years 
and its goal to $1 billion.
The Board takes this action to reaf­
firm its resolution, a mission state­
ment to fulfill its purposes, which 
declares: “By aggressively supporting 
the advancement of Pitt's academic 
mission, we will clearly establish that 
this is one of the finest and most pro­
ductive universities in the world.” 
Discover a World of Possibilities has 
raised in excess of $510 million.

Medical, 8/20/02, 12:54pm — 
Bees stung a small child in front of 
Doherty Hall. CMU EMS and City 
Medics responded. No transport was 
necessary. The complainant contact­
ed the Carnegie Mellon Police 
Department to report that bees stung 
a young child in front of Doherty 
Hall. The victim was located in front 
of Doherty Hall with his family. The 
bee’s nest was located in front of 
Doherty hall on the southern side 
^about five feet in front of the build­
ing, directly in front of the 1949 
engraving of the building.
Outside Alcohol, 8/22/02, 
1:23am — Police were conducting a 
patrol near Theta Xi’s patio. A white 
male near an outside table suddenly 
turned and entered the house. When 
^police entered the patio they found 
two cups of beer on a tabletop. The 
fraternity president accepted a cita­
tion for the house.
Suspicious activity, 8/22/02, 
4:33 pm — Suspicious activity in the 
bookstore.
Harassment by Communication,
8/23/02, 3:24 am — Campus Police 
was dispatched to Hamerschlag 
House A310 for a Harassment by 
Communication report. A CMU stu­
dent reported that at 11:15 pm he 
received a harassing phone call. The 
male caller asked if he wanted to play 
ultimate Frisbee. The caller did call 
the student by name but said he 
signed up at the service desk and 
asked the student if his extension was 
the number called. The student said it 
was and asked the caller what his 
name was. The caller gave the name 
of the captain of the Frisbee team. 
The caller asked again if the student 
wanted to play ultimate Frisbee. 
When the student said no, the caller 
asked if the student was gay. The stu­
dent stated no. The caller said the stu­
dent must be if he didn’t want to play 
ultimate Frisbee, and then said “I’m 
going to kill you, motherfucker,” and 
hung up. The student is not sure if the 
call originated on or off-campus. The 
student e-mailed Dan Barnett, House 
Fellow, concerning this call. Only one 
call had been received. If the calls 
jcontinue, the student will contact the 
University Police. A check of the 
housing roster and C-Book for the 
name the caller gave the student 
proved fruitless.

inflammatory rhetoric and "flights of

Despite repeated attempts, Lane 
could not be reached for comment.
Mintus' unsolicited statement corf- 
tinued that the police investigation 
into his column "create [s] a troubling 
misuse of University Police resources 
during a time when our campus and 
the surrounding area have been 
plagued by terrible criminal acts that 
demand a strong police presence. I 
find this entire ordeal insulting and 
wasteful and I hope that the situation 
will be resolved as quickly and effi­
ciently as possible at minimal cost to 
the students and employees of this 
University."

Lane charged that Mintus' remarks 
about using "an eight-inch hunting 
knife" to "carve [himself] a few slabs 
of unethical swine" amounted to "ter­
roristic threats." His commentary 
stemmed from his disdain for finan­
cial cuts made to the budget of The 
Tartan.
Shortly after receiving notice that 
Campus Police would conduct an

THE TARTAN • AUGUST 26,2002
Two new fraternities arrive on campus
,, by Andrew Johnson
97.e NVRolu
Sam and Darren are leading mem­
bers of a new fraternity on campus. 
So are Tom and Jon.
You won’t see these two fraterni­
ties on the Quad very soon, though. 
.You won’t see a group of predomi- 
„ nantly white males drinking cheap 
.-beer and playing loud music. These 
guys aren’t the athletes of Beta 
house, the self-proclaimed animals of 
, Sigma Nu, or even the techno reclus- 
w7e of ThetaXi.
If you want to tack a stereotype on 
-.these guys, it’s probably studious 
j> Asians.
tpu Darren Chan and Sam Byun are 
the president and social vice presi- 
r dent of Lambda Phi Epsilon CL Phi E), 
i a Greek organization that sprang 
from the Brotherhood of Asian- 
American Men. Here in America, it’s 
Darren and Sam. In the east, specifi­
cally China and Korea, you’d proba- 
R bly call these guys Wai-loon and 
a Sang-hyup.
The dichotomy of their names is 
^indicative of their drive in forming 
, this new Greek organization from 
, -their Asian-American interest group.
“As an Asian-American you grow 
r-tup in a merger of two very different 
cultures,” said Chan.
Chan said that the group is con­
cerned with addressing this issue 
that can sometimes lead to confusion 
in people caught between two cul­
tures and also that they were inter­
ested in preserving Asian culture.
Yet, all of these things don’t 
require a few Greek letters to make 
them happen. Already on campus 
there is a proliferation of Asian inter­
est groups. What this group of men 
hopes to gain from the Greek system 
is a sense of permanence, said Byun. 
He went on to say that in non-Greek 
student organizations, a person 
couldn’t come back to campus 10 
years later and still have a connection 
with the group.
With the Greek mantle comes all
Admissions in decline, 
enrollment on the rise
the trappings of the system, includ­
ing a motto, rush, and communal liv­
ing. In the next three weeks, the 
group will seek others who want “to 
be leaders among men,” kicking off 
Wednesday with a barbeque and an 
info session, to be followed by events 
such as paintball, basketball, and 
mixers with sororities, financed out 
of the pockets of the 17 brothers, at 
$150 a pop.
Pi Delta Psi (PDPsi), headed by 
Tom Liou, president, and Jon 
Tanwanteng, vice president, has the 
distinction of being the first of the 
two Asian interest fraternities, as 
well as the distinction of being the 
first new fraternity on campus since 
Sigma Phi Epsilon recolonized in 
1995.
PDPsi formed in response to a void 
the brothers felt on campus.
“The group originally formed in 
the spring of 2000,” said Liou. “CMU 
at the time had no cultural Greek 
organizations for minorities such as 
Asians, Latinos, and African 
Americans, while at most other large 
universities such organizations had
been established for decades.”
PDPsi’s plans for rush are similar to 
those of LFE, with dinners, info ses­
sions, and football planned to attract 
community members who seek 
“excellence through brotherhood.” 
Yet, while the two fraternities’ mottos 
differ, they face a similar challenge 
during rush. While both of their 
national orders have brothers from 
diverse ethnic backgrounds, neither 
numbers a single non-Asian brother 
locally.
“We have had some [non-Asians] 
who have been interested. It’s hard. 
People see there are no non-Asian 
brothers,” said Byun. "A new rushee 
would have to feel comfortable with 
the members of the house in order 
for him/her to decide to join."
Neither group discriminates 
against non-Asian rushers.
While it is true that both groups 
are Asian, they have some fundamen­
tal differences at their cores. While 
LFE is dedicated to service and social 
endeavors like existing fraternities 
according to Chan, PDPsi is a cultural 
fraternity, says Liou.
Security measures slow to implement
CRIME, from page A1
project is going, and the answer to that is forward,” said 
Namey.
The committee asked which lights Namey liked. 
“Student government works well with Chief Doyle,” said 
Namey. “We’ve also helped to improve other security mea­
sures like signs and better lighting at shuttle stops, as 
escort often often misses students.”
Installation will also be propelled by the new dormito­
ry project. Two blue lights are to be installed at the new 
dormitory located on Morewood Avenue between Mudge 
House and Morewood Gardens. Another will be installed 
at a cement isle twenty yards from the entrance to 
Devonshire Street.
There are disadvantages to blue light phones. At George 
Mason University in Fairfax, VA, emergency telephones 
were removed last semester due to lack of usage, cost of 
telephone calls and high maintenance costs. GMU’s tele­
phones had a 360 degree camera, which could be activat­
ed by pushing a button. Another button contacted univer­
sity police.
However, all involved with the project agree that it is 
important to give students a sense of security. Doyle says 
the University does not track usage, but he says they are 
used sporadically.
Though criminal instances increase, is not so much the 
increasing number of criminal offences on campus as the 
vigilance of students committed to safety at Carnegie 
Mellon that encourages changes in security. “I think stu­
dents are a bit more vigilant than in years past. This is a 
critical issue-while we don't want students to be unduly 
anxious about security, we are in a big city and we should 
all take the according precautions,” says Murphy.
Last October, a female student was raped in the Peace 
Garden adjacent to the Hunt Library. Doyle said, however, 
that lighting here was not the issue.
“There really is enough light to read a book there,” said 
Doyle. He discourages students from walking alone at 
night, especially through the Devonshire Street path at 
the North side of the Morewood parking lot, popular 
among students who do not want to walk the distance up 
Morewood Avenue to Fifth Avenue.
“Ideally, the University would install key card access in 
all buildings, “ says Elliott. Key card access is currently 
installed at Wean Hall, Doherty Hall, Mellon Institute, 
and Newell-Simon Hall. The University Center, opened in 
1996, built its own internal security system with the orig­
inal instruction, which Doyle dictates is not very reliable. 
It is less expensive to install individual security systems in 
buildings than to allow expansion of the current campus
security network, an option Hamburg Hall has taken. 
“This has the potential to be very dangerous. There is only 
so much encoding available. If you have a Honeywell sys­
tem installed in one building and an SSA system installed 
in another, there will be problems.”
Installing security systems in older buildings will also 
be difficult. Hamerschlag Hall is an old building with 
many levels. “In Hamerschlag Hall, a lot of independent 
research and lectures take place, so security is always dif­
ficult. If a basement laboratory were to install a system, 
and police or the fire department had to enter the lab, 
access would be very difficult. Faculty, staff and students 
call campus police as it is to let them into the building.” 
Enrollment estimates a security system in Baker and 
Porter Halls will cost $160,000 to $200,000.
“Just as you may have a wish list of things you would 
like to purchase for yourself, the university has a list of 
things it would like to purchase. Academics are at a high­
er priority. It is important for us to improve our facilities 
as we did in the departments of chemistry and computer 
science,” says Elliott. “The funds departments get from 
organizations such as the National Science Foundation do 
not cover things like building construction.”
“There are always tough funding issues,” says Murphy. 
“Even within the safety arena, there are issues such as 
expanded shuttle and escort service that compete for 
resources. Most often, the outcome is a strategic shift over 
time, as opposed to a massive expenditure in one area. I 
think it is clear that students would like more attention to 
the issue of emergency phones, and I am confident Chief 
Doyle and others will be moving us in that direction.”
In addition to technical security, the CMU police 
department has increased its patrols, including officers on 
bicycles and working undercover. The University also e- 
mails students when a violent crime occurs. From March 
1, students could take advantage of the Safewalk pro­
gram. After completing a training session, student volun­
teers walk students to local destinations from 11pm to 
3am nightly. CMU also offers Rape Aggression Defense, a 
twelve-hour course sponosored by the campus police to 
those interested in learing self-defense.
“I think students feel generally safe in residence halls — 
the greater concern is in moving between buildings at 
night, as well as walking off-campus. The academic build­
ings are of greatest concern, because the safety in num­
bers can be compromised late at night,” says Murphy.
As it is a central part of the campus and able to ¿Illumi­
nate the Hill dorms and. Resnik/West Wing, many stu­
dents have suggested lighting Gesling Stadium after dark, 
though neither Murphy nor Doyle claimed to know any­
thing about such an endeavor.

Carnegie Mellon’s applicant 
pool this year saw a precipitous 
decline, with international student 
applications seeing the most dra­
matic decrease. While the applica­
tion stacks in Warner Hall shrunk, 
CMU increased the number of stu­
dents it actually accepted.
In April of last year, things 
looked a bit grim for the 
University. Just 14,023 students 
had paid their $55 to be evaluated 
by the admissions board. A few 
more applications trickled in after 
that, but too few to slow a steep 
decline from last year’s record 
16,696. Appliations have dropped 
14.5 percent, and the acceptance 
has risen 7 percent from last year 
to 38 percent.
Last year’s all-time high of 1,861 
intenational applicants plummeted 
24 percent to 1,413.
Vice president for enrollment 
William Elliot attributed the 
decline to two main sources. He 
noted that just as the dot-coms had 
crashed, the demand for comput­
ing-related majors decreased. He 
also said that this year the “mid­
dling” students who had applied in 
previous years decided not to both­
er. With this decline, the average 
SAT scores of incoming students 
remained static.
In contrast, the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology experi­
enced no decrease in its applicant 
pool, though it didn’t have the 
increases it had been experiencing 
in recent years.
MIT and CMU converge on sev­
eral qualities. They both have high­
ly-respected engineering and com­
puter science departments and a 
relatively high number of under­
graduate international students, 
ten and eight percent respectively. 
When it comes financial aid poli­
cies however, the two sharply 
diverge, as CMU does not offer 
financial aid of any sort to interna­
tional students, while MIT does. 
Even in other areas of financial aid, 
the two universities are very differ­
ent, mostly because CMU just does­
n’t have as much money as its 
Boston counterpart. Carnegie 
Mellon ranks 63rd overall with an 
endowment of $757 million, far 
behind sixth-ranked MIT's endow­
ment of $6.13 billion. Fewer stu­
dents at CMU apply for financial 
aid than at MIT. Less Carnegie 
Mellon students are found to have 
financial need by the University, 
and those that are found to have 
need have a lower percentage of 
their financial need met, according 
to the 2001 Lh 97.e HEV ilufV 
D72luo on universities. This means
a bigger bill from CMU to parents 
in the middle of a recession, and 
perhaps a butchering of CMU’s 
international student cash cow.
CMU admissions faces more 
than just a bear market too, with 
September 11 still casting its long 
shadow. Following the attacks, 
CMU was forced to cancel many of 
its plans for recruitment abroad, 
though in an April interview with 
The Tartan, Director of admissions 
Michael Steidel remained confi­
dent.
“We cancelled all international 
travel, but the 
students still 
found us,” 
said Steidel.
“It’s exciting 
that 
[Carnegie 
Mellon] is 
able to attract 
the best in the 
world.” 20@@@0ic %@@0X\
Seemingly, the top students still 
seek out the top universities. That’s 
not to say that there weren’t issues 
that resulted from the attacks. 
Since security measures have tight­
ened, student visas have become 
harder to acquire. On top of the 
normal five to 15 visa denials that 
prevent or delay students from 
coming to CMU each year, this year 
a group of eight Malaysian stu­
dents has not been able to secure 
visas, according to Lisa Krieg, 
director of international educa­
tion.
“The issue of longer visa process­
ing was expected,” said Krieg.
While Krieg could not point to 
the exact nature of the hold-up in 
visa processing for this group of 
students, she did have some con­
jecture.
“The issue with this group is a 
post-September 11 phenomena,” 
said Krieg. “In the post 9-11 envi­
ronment, there was an unofficial 
list of 20 countries. Malaysia was 
on that list.” Citizens of countries 
that made the list, reported by the 
Washington Post but unconfirmed 
by the US government, face 
rougher scrutiny from the govern­
ment. According to Krieg, the five 
to 15 students who normally fail to 
gain visas may not be the only ones 
who have been spurned by the 
State Department.
These are merely the ones that 
contact CMU about their troubles. 
The University doesn’t always 
learn about failed visa bids, says 
Krieg. “We have not kept close 
track of it.”
As to whether the University 
proactively seeks to help students 
having trouble seeking visas, Krieg 
said one admission document sug­
gests students contact the 
University.

Pennsylvanian Congressional dis­
tricts, in accordance with new cen­
sus information. The research done 
at the PSC was intended to aid the 
GOP in analyzing district voter infor­
mation, ostensibly to best determine 
how to draw district lines to favor 
Republicans in coming elections.
Last spring a committee met to 
review the University’s research 
policies and will continue its analy­
sis this fall. The committee included 
Kamlet, Susan Burkett, associate 
provost for research administration, 
John Anderson, Dean of CIT, Chris 
Gabriel, vice provost of corporate 
partnerships and tech develop­
ments, and Steven Cross, director pf 
the Software Engineering Institute. 
Additionally, Mike Levine, co-direc- 
tor of PSC, Clark Glymour, chair of 
the Faculty Senate, and legal coun­
selor Mary Jo Dively may be 
involved with future meetings.
Only faculty attended the first and 
only meeting last spring and Kamlet 
hopes to increase student involve­
ment. Kamlet is communicating 
with Student Body President Brian 
Namey in search of student repre­
sentatives when the committee 
reconvenes in September. “The 
question of the specific contract that 
the PSC made to the unfair benefit 
of the Republican Party should be 
disturbing to everyone,” said 
Quinten Steenhuis, junior 
Philosophy major and member of 
the Student Senate. Steenhuis had 
advocated against the research and 
in favor of student participation in 
the committee on research since last 
semester.
Steenhuis indicates a willingness 
to work with the committee as a stu­
dent representative. He says the aim 
of the committee should be, “to cre­
ate a policy that satisfies questions 
of pragmatism and student concerns 
relating to ethical and human 
dimensions, while fully protecting 
academic freedom and continuing 
our university’s strong record of 
achievement in research.”
Kamlet also said that the commit­
tee’s progress had been postponed, 
waiting for Dively to assume her 
post as general counsel in 
September.
The committee will consider clari­
fications to the process of accepting 
research grants in coming weeks.
“It is my hope that a lesson has 
been learned here, and I will contin­
ue to monitor state spending at CMU 
to make sure of it,” said DeWeese.
The University received $526,000 
over a three-year period to conduct 
research at the Pittsburgh 
Supercomputing Center (PSC) for 
the GOP.

None of this could be forgotten, 
despite the incident. When speaking 
about his colleague, Hounshell 
tellingly referred to him in the pre­
sent tense.
“I still value him as a colleague. He 
has a very fine mind,” said 
Hounshell. “I think it’s a tragedy, 
and I think that’s the only way to 
describe it.”
The charges facing Constant were 
numerous — and serious. He was 
initially charged with two counts of 
attempted criminal homicide, four 
counts of aggravated assault, con­
spiracy to commit criminal homi­
cide, and simple assault.
Later, one attempted homicide 
charge and the conspiracy charge 
were dropped.
The disparity between the profes­
sor and the accused criminal makes 
it hard for anyone to reconcile the 
startling nature of the incident. 
Indeed, there is little anyone can do 
but wonder how this happened.
“I had a few very pleasant person­
al experiences with him ... and there 
was no sign in whatever interaction 
with him that anything like that was 
possible,” said Campbell.
According to his lawyer, Paul 
Boas, Constant pled not guilty to his
charges at his formal arraignment 
on Thursday, August 15. Presently, 
Constant is being held without bail 
in the Allegheny County Jail in 
downtown Pittsburgh, and awaits a 
pre-trial conference on Friday, 
September 13, at which the trial 
date will be set.
Boas would not discuss how he 
was approaching the trial. 
Meanwhile, observers, like 
Campbell, hope for the best possible 
outcome.
“I just wish his family well because 
I know they’re going through a very 
trying time,” he said. “I don't know 
what sort of result will ultimately be 
arrived at, but I hope it’s a just one.”

THE TARTAN • AUGUST 26, 2002
Court injunction cites procedural errors in University Disciplinary Committee
UDC, from page A1
In mid-May, the four students 
appeared before a board comprised 
of two faculty, two students, and one 
staff member to face charges of 
“unauthorized entry, disorderly con­
duct, and vandalism/destruction of 
property” according to a May 20 let­
ter from Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy. The board later 
added a charge of “misrepresentation 
of information presented during the 
hearing.” Carnegie Mellon’s UDC 
board found all four persons guilty, 
ruling that the students should be 
suspended for the entire 2002-03 
school year, pay restitution for dam­
ages and lost wages, and submit a 
“reflective paper on the importance 
of diversity and freedom of expres­
sion to a community.”
Each of the four respondents had 
to pay $807 each, or $1,680 in lost 
wages aggregate for Kofmehl and 
$1,548 to repair the property they 
damaged. The Magistrate asked that 
the four students perform 56 hours of 
community service and pay court 
costs of $91.50 each.
The students promptly appealed 
the decision, only to be misled by 
Elliott according to their brief. They 
also claim the school failed to honor a 
promise to render an appeal verdict 
by the end of June. An email dated
June 7 sent by Elliott as obtained by 
The Tartan reads, “Appeal 
received...I will be out of the office 
for several days next week, but will 
tend to this matter before the end of 
June.” Elliott did qualify that he 
would communicate with Pierce and 
others on an as needed basis.
Attorney Martin Scoratow, who 
represented the four brothers at 
Magistrate’s Court on May 15 says 
the University’s actions not only con­
stituted systemic violations of due 
process, but simple forthrightness 
and fairness.
“I think they [Carnegie Mellon] 
hold themselves to a lower standard. 
I think Dr. Elliott and...university 
administrators could fit in with the 
people at Enron.”
Stephen Jurman will represent 
Pierce and Nearhoof this morning, 
but he may call Scoratow as a wit­
ness.
In an interview with The Tartan, 
Scoratow cited numerous flaws with 
the UDC process. Among them, that 
Director of Student Life Renee 
Camerlengo was approached by a 
fifth actor but refused to make his 
presence known to the UDC board, 
let alone charge him with the other 
four students.
“When you’re a prosecutor...you 
have a duty to bring that person [the 
fifth participant] in and make all the
facts known,” said Scoratow.
He purports that the University 
was embarrassed that they had lost 
control over Kofmehl’s project. He 
says the school was in an unflattering 
position when the City of Pittsburgh 
found Kofmehl to be living in a struc­
ture that did not meet building codes. 
Camerlengo as an employee had an 
interest to protect the University’s 
reputation, Scoratow argues.
The punishment is a particularly 
onerous response for DU, says Pierce, 
who currently serves as the fraterni­
ty’s president. Nearhoof serves as 
treasurer.
“They know that [removing four 
executive members] is screwing the 
house and I really can’t help but think 
that it’s an underhanded way of say­
ing Sve believe the rest of your house 
was involved in this too,” says Pierce.
His remarks touch on one of the 
more nebulous charges: “misrepre­
sentation of information presented 
during the hearing.” Neither Elliott 
nor Murphy would comment on the 
facts of the case. The defendants 
argued at the UDC hearing that con­
trary to the statement of Kofmehl and 
the testimony of his witness, senior 
art major Merritt Johnson, only six 
individuals were present as opposed 
to twelve intruders Kofmehl claimed. 
The UDC board only heard from 
Johnson and the responding police
officer.
The UDC case was based largely on 
the information furnished by Campus 
Police says Camerlengo. But Campus 
Police Detective Martin White says 
there was no investigation into the 
matter since all the actors, with the 
exception of two persons, were 
caught at the scene.
“The investigation was pretty 
much null and void because the 
‘Lobster Boy’ wasn’t talking.”
And the statements provided by 
Johnson and the police officer were 
unflappable in the eyes of the UDC 
board say Pierce, Nearhoof, and 
Piccione.
Nearhoof estimates that of the fif­
teen to twenty questions the four 
defendants asked, only two or three 
were entertained by the UDC board. 
In a UDC hearing, all questions, wit­
nesses, and evidence are suggested 
for consideration by the complainant 
or respondent. UDC board members 
then decide whether to entertain the 
inquiry. Nearhoof estimates that 
approximately 50 percent of 
Kofmehl’s questions were considered.
Additionally, Pierce says impartial­
ity was not one of the UDC board’s 
finer points. Defendants are permit­
ted to have a non-vocal advisor pre­
sent that can provide advice on 
notepaper. During a break in the pro­
ceedings, UDC student member Peter
Schmidt approached Pierce’s advisor 
and said that the board would go eas­
ier on the defendants if they would 
come clean. Schmidt would not com­
ment.
“We came out and said that we 
were willing to take responsibility 
and we could come to some reason­
able conclusion, but it doesn’t seem 
to have worked out that way,” says 
Nearhoof.
If their efforts to refute Kofmehl’s 
testimony would be ignored and the 
case appeared to be an issue of 
Kofmehl’s word against theirs, the 
four students wondered how could 
they prove their case? They noted 
that in the Word, the student hand­
book, a “gross error in procedural 
processes as revealed in a transcript 
of the hearing” was a basis for 
appeal. They immediately appealed 
the UDC decision and in accordance 
with University policy, “request [ed] 
that the tapes of the hearing be tran­
scribed.” However, Elliott said that 
wouldn’t be necessary and refused 
the transcription request says 
Nearhoof. And after receiving 
Elliott’s offer of “social probation,” 
Nearhoof and Pierce have decided to 
sue the University.
“The entire lesson and message has 
been lost throughout this whole 
thing. We were honest, we were 
forthright, we played by the rules,
and we got screwed. So that’s what 
we’re taking from this now,” said 
Nearhoof.
But the lesson is clear as daybreak 
to Kofmehl’s father, Dr. William 
Kofmehl, Sr.
He saw their actions as the destruc­
tion of research, the hard labor of an 
industrious young art student.
When he discusses his son’s three- 
story structure, his voice riles with a 
hint of passion, as he recounts the 
destruction of a building that was 
solely constructed by his son.
“You put two years of your life into 
something and you have to complete 
the destruction that other people 
started. That hurts a great deal.” Dr. 
Kofmehl hopes that the defendants 
realize what they did is wrong and 
they are lucky to be alive.
“I am very glad that no parent is 
mourning the death of one of their 
children. What they were involved in, 
could have got one of the individuals 
very seriously injured or killed.”
As for Kofmehl, Jr., he is still delib­
erating the merits of a civil suit and is 
unsure whether he will continue his 
project. At the end of last school year, 
he submitted a proposal based large­
ly on his original ideas of a movie set 
and a structure that could serve as an 
alternative lecture site.
“I havent received word yet from 
the University.”

Reprising their roles, humans and ores once again duke it out, but something sin­
ister is hiding just beyond the horizon.
by Alexander Meseguer
meeReoHEo haR7Ea7 HEV k7abElflAw NVRolu
A company synonymous with 
addictively innovative computer 
game production has recently 
released their eagerly awaited title, 
Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. A title 
of this magnitude sets the computer 
gaming world ablaze and finds its 
way onto gamers’ hard drives, 
whether it be through means legal or 
otherwise. So in my new review for­
mat (for those of you who are keep­
ing track, and I know there are oh so 
many of you), let’s go over what’s 
good, what’s bad, and what fell vic­
tim to the ugly stick.
The Good:
The stalwart Blizzard game design 
shows and it shows well. Well-bal­
anced races, eye-curdling graphics 
and an immersive single-player story 
make for a game that’s easy to pick 
up and lose yourself in for hours.
Improvements to Battle.Net (the 
Blizzard online gaming network) 
abound; its new automatic player 
matching feature makes it more 
appealing than ever to venture out 
onto the Internet in search of oppo­
nents. The new World Builder pro­
gram that was included with the 
game enables anyone with experi­
ence in Java-like programming to 
create items, units, spells ... the pos­
sibilities are almost endless and 
make the fan-based game feel RPG- 
ish in nature.
Weather, dynamic lighting, and 
time of day all factor into gameplay, 
creating nuances even the novice 
player will take note of. Graphically, 
it’s Blizzard’s first entirely 3-D title 
and although they may be new to the 
task, it doesn’t seem that way. Units 
are amazingly detailed with facial 
expressions. Gestures are rendered 
in real-time within the game’s 
engine and enhance the storyline 
rather than cripple it.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Blizzard 
game without annoyance quotes
from the units themselves. Anyone 
who’s a fan of previous titles will 
laugh anew at the great sayings and 
sounds that multiple pokes will pro­
duce.
The single-player game is exciting 
and acclimates the gamer pretty 
quickly. The start and end of each 
mission are accompanied by in-game 
cutscenes that advance the plot and 
convey a sense that everything in the 
land of Lordaeron is tied together in 
some way. The end of each race’s 
campaign is punctuated by a full- 
motion video of stunning quality and 
dramatic poise; the 
only viable compar­
isons are the cutscenes 
at the end of each act in 
Diablo II, of which Act 
II is arguably one of the 
best ever.
The Bad:
Usually, there is very 
little to complain about 
when it comes to 
Blizzard games, but 
there was one thing in 
Warcraft III which irked 
me. Price. They have 
bucked the trend of 
falling computer game 
prices and jacked the 
cost of admission to the 
world of gaming good­
ness to $60. This may 
seem like a small point 
to some, but there are 
many people Who are 
highly affected by the 
cost of computer soft­
ware, especially with 
the constant upward 
pressure of hardware 
upgrades. It has been 
said that Blizzard has 
raised the prices due to 
their fight over illegal 
usage of the beta ver­
sion and the cost of los­
ing sales to warez and 
pirated versions of the
game. However, selling 4.5 million 
copies of the game seems to obliter­
ate the fly in their ointment. Add this 
to the fact that boxes are getting 
smaller, and you end up feeling a lit­
tle shortchanged when you pay more 
to get something of less physical sub­
stance. This complaint is in no way 
meant to undermine the excellent 
production quality of the game and I 
know many people who would glad­
ly pay upwards of $70 or $80 for a 
game of this class from a company of 
this renown.
The Ugly:
Blizzard has created another fine 
addition to both the world of 
Warcraft and their line of titles. The 
ugly stick need not apply here. A 
must have for any die-hard Blizzard 
gamer or any computer gamer in 
general who considers himself a con­
noisseur of fine electronic entertain­
ment.

CMU builds solar-powered house for Washington, D.C. Decathlon
by John Davin
haR7Ea7 J k7abElflAw NVRolu
In Germany, entire communities 
are made up of solar-powered 
homes. While the US has not as 
rapidly adopted solar houses, steps 
are being taken toward green energy 
use. From September 27 to October 
4, the National Mall in Washington, 
D.C. will become a temporary solar 
village. The inaugural event, the 
Solar Decathlon, is sponsored by the 
US Department of Energy in an 
effort to demonstrate the practical 
uses of solar energy.
A team of Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents is currently building a solar- 
powered house in the Donner Ditch. 
From walls filled with denim jeans to 
a plant-covered roof, the design fea­
tures a number of techniques to 
increase energy efficiency and create 
a comfortable place to live.
The steel frame house has been 
taking shape over the summer, and 
was in the planning stages as early as 
October 2001. It will be able to sup­
port all of the standard amenities of 
a modern house, including a home 
business.
“Part of this competition is to show 
that every luxury of a normal house 
can be accommodated with solar 
energy,” said Andy Lee, a fifth-year 
architecture student and chief archi­
tect of the house.
The Decathlon in Washington, 
D.C. will have about 12 students 
from the CMU house to re-assemble 
it and conduct tasks required for 
judging. Students will be asked to 
demonstrate certain capabilities of 
the house, such as cooking, shower­
ing, use of a home business, and 
powering a small electric vehicle. 
Each team will be using a Ford 
Think, a small electrically powered 
cart.
Entries in the competition are 
expected to be able to independently 
sustain power for a week. The CMU 
house, named Resolution, contains 
an 850 amp-hour battery array, 
which is used to store excess energy 
from the solar panels, and later 
reclaim the energy when it is need­
ed.
“You could pretty much run the 
- entire house off the battery for a 
week,” said Andy Lee.
When complete, Resolution will 
have a front porch with a balcony on 
the second floor. Most of the roof 
will be covered with solar panels, or 
photovoltaic arrays.
Resolution utilizes several techno­
logical innovations from the Robert 
L. Preger Intelligent Workplace (IW). 
The IW is an advanced workplace on 
top of Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Hall that was designed to maximize 
work efficiency and worker comfort.

Ozone hole sees 
growth spurt
While college students worry about 
the start of classes at the end of every 
summer, scientists at the World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) 
are concerned with how big the hole 
in the ozone layer of Antarctica will 
become. The hole, generally blamed 
on chlorofluorocarbons and other 
chemicals, grows in size dramatically 
at this time of year for meteorological 
reasons.
“As expected, the annually occur­
ring ozone hole is again forming over 
Antarctica. The ozone hole is still 
small, but will expand and deepen 
during the next four to six weeks,” 
the WMO said. The agency also said a 
second region of very low ozone lev­
els has appeared near the southern 
tip of South America and spread 
north over much of Argentina.
Measurements over Buenos Aires 
were up to 20 percent lower than the 
“pre-ozone hole norms” based on 
readings from 1964 to 1976. 
Measurements over the southern 
Atlantic Ocean were up to 34 percent 
below the readings from that period.

Life form found in 
schizophrenics
Researchers at Stockholm’s St. 
Goran Hospital have discovered a tiny 
particle, larger than a virus but small­
er than bacteria, in the spinal marrow 
fluid of schizophrenia patients. In the 
fluid of 22 affected patients and 38 
controls, 20 of the schizophrenia 
patients and only two of the controls 
had the mysterious new particle pre­
sent. “They may be involved in the 
development of the disease or may 
result from the disease process in 
brains of schizophrenic patients,” the 
researchers said.

the study published Friday in 
97puleaR7Ea7 n7oo7uec said that “they 
are not any of the usual viruses or 
bacteria that have been found. They 
are more like something like the 
prion which is causing mad cow dis­
ease — but it took 15 years until it 
was found out what that really was.”

FBI’s hacking to be 
contested in court
Seattle defense attorney John 
Lundin is defending two Russians 
being tried in the United States for 
credit card fraud and other electronic 
crimes. He hopes to have key evi­
dence thrown out on the grounds 
that FBI agents broke into Russian 
computer systems to acquire the evi­
dence without a search warrant. 
Since the targeted computers were in 
Russia, the FBI claims that they didn’t 
need a warrant.
Lundin argues that since the 
incriminating data was transferred to 
computers in the US as part of the 
search, a warrant was necessary. This 
issue was already decided in a lower 
court, in the FBI’s favor, but Lundin’s 
clients are appealing. The ultimate 
outcome will establish an important 
precedent for the future of electronic 
law enforcement.

Radio telescope 
planned for VLA
A new radio telescope is on the 
drawing board, one that will achieve 
previously unprecedented resolutions 
of radio signals. What’s unique about 
this endeavor is the fact that it is 
being put together from the ground 
up as an international project. With a 
projected cost of over $1 billion, one 
nation taking on the project would 
incur a massive risk.
The international team includes 
Cornell, Cal Tech, SETI, the Max 
Planck Institute, and the Beijing 
Institute. The name of the new 
instrument is the SKA, or Square 
Kilometer Array. Staffed with a pan­
theon of world-renowned scientists, 
the group is searching for sui.-.jle 
methods of deploying the device.
One proposed idea is to coat a val­
ley with a reflective surface and sus­
pend collectors above using balloons. 
The end result will be a collector with 
100 times the resolution and sensitiv­
ity of even the most modern radio 
telescope facility, the AVLA 
(American Very Large Array) in New 
Mexico.

Warcraft III: addictive, engrossing, and it will drain your pockets
Andy Lee and Ryan Stahlman, both architecture students, work on construction of the solar-powered house for the upcoming Solar Decathlon competition in 
Washington, D.C.
floor system as the IW. The floors 
have panels with space below for 
running wires and utility lines. This 
helps to improve insulation because 
it allows the builders to avoid cutting 
holes in walls. Another technology 
that transferred over is the software 
control system. The house uses 
“Metasys,” the software system used 
to control the environment in the IW.
There are two types of solar power 
systems. A stand-alone system is not 
connected to the city power grid and 
is completely dependent on generat­
ing its own power. An extended peri­
od of cloudy weather could deplete 
the batteries, leaving the house with­
out any power. The other type of sys­
tem is connected to the power grid 
and can buy or sell power.
“The whole concept behind a grid- 
connected photovoltaic system is 
that when you are producing more 
power than the house is consuming, 
you’re selling it to the utility compa­
ny And when you’re not producing 
any power, you’re buying it from the 
utility company,” said Stephen Lee, 
an architecture professor and an 
advisor to the team.
At the Solar Decathlon, the houses 
will be stand-alone systems because 
they cannot connect to the
Washington, D.C. power grid. 
However, after the competition the 
CMU team plans to install the house 
into a Pittsburgh-area community 
such as East Liberty or Garfield. It 
would be connected to the grid so 
that power would not be lost during 
extended periods of cloudy weather. 
The house would be placed on a cor­
ner because it is designed to be situ­
ated at the corner of two intersecting 
streets.
In Germany, where grid connected 
solar-powered homes are common, 
houses fall into a class of low energy, 
zero energy, or plus energy. Low 
energy houses produce less energy 
than they buy, zero energy houses 
produce the same amount as they 
buy, and plus energy houses produce 
more energy than they buy. Plus 
energy houses actually make a profit 
by selling energy back to the utility' 
company.
The German government signed 
an agreement in 2001 to phase out 
19 of the country’s nuclear power 
plants. As a result, Germany strongly 
promotes solar energy and subsi­
dizes construction of solar houses.
The house will feature a bed of 
plants on a flat portion of the roof 
which will not contain solar panels.
The dirt and plantings on the roof 
will help to absorb heat and will also 
soak up rain water instead of letting 
it simply run off into surrounding 
areas. This is in sync with the idea of 
being responsible for the water that 
falls on the footprint of a house. 
Traditional houses simply let water 
run off into surrounding lands which 
can contribute to flooding and ero­
sion.
The green roof also is beneficial 
because it absorbs heat from the sun. 
Many cities have “heat islands” — 
areas that heat up by several degrees 
due to houses with black roofs. The 
green roof can help eliminate this 
heat elevation in cities, explained 
Stephen Lee.
Resolution includes a loft bed­
room, which will make the house 
taller than the contest’s height limit. 
The designers of the project felt that 
it was important to design a house 
that would fit in an urban environ­
ment. “We have a commitment to the 
urban model,” said Andy Lee. 
Though the team may be penalized 
slightly for the extra height, they feel 
they will do very well in the livability 
ratings of the competition.
Construction of the house is run­
ning behind schedule, however.
Several teams, including Virginia 
Tech, have already completed con­
struction and testing of their house. 
Stephen Lee said that it will not be a 
problem completing the house in 
time, but there will be less time for 
testing. He is working to recruit CMU 
alumni in Washington, D.C. to assist 
with the move-in.
For some of the architecture, 
design, and mechanical engineering 
students working on the house, past 
courses have helped prepare for this 
project. A course in the architecture 
department, titled Zero Energy 
House, taught the principles of run­
ning a house that produces as much 
energy as it uses, leaving a net ener­
gy input of zero.
Another course offered in the 
School of Architecture, Powering the 
Campus of the Future, studies power 
generation on college campuses, 
including fuel cell technology.
Students working on the project 
explained that the project is a good 
experience because everything they 
learn in the classroom, they get to 
apply to the house. They also learn 
plenty of new things. “They don’t 
teach how to hang a door in studio,” 
said Ryan Stahlman, a senior archi­
tecture student.

Rethinking priorities: University 
cannot continue to neglect safety
20X0vy iOsH0kobAXt AdaoX
Face the truth that you first-years aren’t special
Lbte rseMac
A semester and a summer have passed 
since the University enacted swifter and 
more drastic crime alert and prevention 
measures. The measures, which only 
began in January despite being in 
response to a rape that occurred in mid- 
October near Hunt Library, were intended 
to heighten students’ awareness of crimi­
nal mischief on campus.
The improved alert system has been uti­
lized several times in the last eight 
months, but none of the concrete security 
measures that have been called for by stu­
dents have been put into effect, most 
notably the installation of more emer­
gency phones across campus and accom­
panying blue lights, and card readers that 
would prevent unauthorized entrance 
into campus buildings.
The University must make concrete 
security measures a reality. In the process, 
administrators and executors of campus 
security should cease the broken record of 
lip service that has misled students and 
deflected attention away from the defi­
ciencies that remain in campus security 
policy.
Since the rape and two February 
attacks, (none of the assailants were ever 
caught) only mere rhetoric has been 
launched to counteract serious crime. 
Kudos to Campus Police for their 
increased patrols, but evidently they have 
done little to spurn rapists, given Sunday 
morning’s aggravated indecent assault.
Despite being the oldest student orga­
nization on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, as 
well as a newspaper that is recognized 
annually by the Associated Collegiate 
Press, The Tartan has always been one of 
a small group of college newspapers that 
remained financially bound to an outside 
party.
In the case of The Tartan, Student 
Government exercised complete bud­
getary control over the organization in 
accordance with the distribution of the 
Student Activities fee. Most recently, the 
Joint Funding Committee offered The 
Tartan $16,000 in funding for 2002-03, a 
precipitous shortchange compared to only 
four years ago when the newspaper was 
provided over $40,000 to supplement 
advertising revenues. Since $16,000 rep­
resented less than 15 percent of our 
expenditures, the Editorial Board made 
the conscious decision to forego the gov­
ernment allotment.
Today, financial independence is not 
just favorable, but feasible as well. The 
Tartan is now being published under self­
fiscal watch.
Beyond the economics of the issue, 
there is a certain moral fabric that is rent 
by a situation in which a newspaper 
reports on th people who supply it with 
money.
One of the primary duties of any news­
paper is to report on events without bias 
and to serve as a buffer against unscrupu­
lous acts within the community.
For the organization to become fully 
independent and to maintain standards, 
we must begin to sever our ties to 
University oversight.
If the organization is to achieve fiscal 
independence, we must be in a position to 
make our own decisions.

We’re getting prevention and aware­
ness, which are invaluable. But we also 
need to fight the fire as it blazes, not just 
figure out how to prevent it in the future. 
By installing emergency phones conspicu­
ously around campus, those who are 
already in danger have a chance. Flyers 
are useless to someone under assault.
It’s been nearly a year and a half since 
card readers were installed at main 
entrances to several academic buildings.
At the time, the University estimated that 
it would cost an additional $1 million to 
outfit remaining academic buildings with 
card readers. Unfortunately, substantive j 
action since that date, such as the card 
reader on GSIA, has been selective. We 
hope to never see the day when a non­
business student should require entrance 
to the building as a safe haven.
And comments by Vice President for 
Enrollment William Elliott that security 
spending would take a back seat to com­
puter cluster initiatives are abhorrent. 
Consider that the University has about a 
computer for every 2.6 persons and one 
blue light for every 10,000 persons. It’s 
pure conjecture to argue that had blue 
lights already been in place on campus 
that these criminals would have been 
quickly apprehended, or the crimes would 
not have taken place. However, it is not 
unreasonable to suggest that Carnegie 
Mellon quit stalling and act upon its 
spring promise of improved security.
The first step for The Tartan is to limit 
fiscal relationships on an as-needed basis 
only. The JFC subsidy represents little 
more than 10 percent of our operating 
expenses.
A deficit can be avoided with spending 
cutbacks and increased advertising rev­
enues because of a new local ad push.
A $16,000 allowance fails to support 
The Tartan’s ambitions even adequately. 
Given that the subsidy comes with com­
plete control of The Tartan’s budget by 
Student Government, we cannot in ethical 
conscience accept the funding.
We do not believe in charging head first 
into any idea without careful thought, 
consideration, and a likelihood of sound 
fiscal health.
We will also seek new sources of fund­
ing concomitantly such as from Tartan 
alumni. Crucial to the success of either of 
these endeavors is the establishment of a 
board of overseers — a collective that will 
guide the paper to financial daylight. To 
have that structure, the paper must first 
be independently-minded.
More immediately noticeable changes 
in The Tartan include the elimination of 
the Business section in favor of a larger 
local Pittsburgh news section.
We’ve also decided to collapse the Arts 
& Living and Entertainment sections into 
one larger magazine, called Pillbox, with 
aims of achieving better coverage and 
more diverse content for the arts and 
entertainment section. This adaptation 
also includes a physical format change to 
tabloid sized paper.
We reason, but more importantly we 
feel that this course of action is not only in 
the best interest of The Tartan, but also in 
the best interest of you, the community 
we serve.

Welcome back, motherfuckers! I hope 
everyone’s summer went reasonably well. 
Much to discuss. But first, a note to the first- 
years:
Hi there. The name’s Mintus. I stir the 
muck around here. Now, you’ve been forced 
to endure more self-gratifying smut over the 
past week than most encounter in their 
entire lives, so this column will hopefully 
constitute a badly-needed deflation of your 
pathetic little egos. I hate to break it to you, 
but you’re not as smart as you’d like to think 
you are, and you’re damned sure not as 
capable as Big Jer [University President 
Jared Cohon] and his happy-happy-joy-joy 
Gestapo have led you to believe. So let us 
dispense with the formalities and get down 
to brass tacks.
I’m not here to BS you. I’m here to inform 
you. And the more time you spend at this 
foul institution, the more you’ll come to 
understand the difference between the two. 
So set your SATs and your class rank aside 
and get ready to become adults. Because, to 
be quite honest, I don’t care about your 
activities list and neither does anyone else. 
It’s time to put on the big boy pants and go to 
town.
Ah, another summer gone by, a few more
While most Carnegie Mellon first-years 
spent last Monday traveling to campus or 
packing for orientation, freshmen and trans­
fer students at the University of North 
Carolina (UNC) met in groups to discuss 
what has become something of a firestorm. 
Was it President Bush’s plans to attack Iraq, 
date rape on campus, or funding for higher 
education? No, it was a book.
Like a few other colleges and universities, 
UNC has implemented a summer reading 
program. Incoming first-years and transfer 
students are all asked to read the same 
book, write a short response paper, and 
attend a small group discussion led by facul­
ty and staff. They've been doing this since 
1999, and previous books have included 
kb7u7 mu7 9l sbRfVu7E x7u7 by Alex Kotlowitz 
and slEy7V7uHo7e RE ob7 mooRa by Tony 
Horwitz.
Given what UNC calls Western civiliza­
tions’ interest in Islam and the September 11 
attacks, the faculty chose m22ulHabREA ob7 
“putHE” kb7 NHufw D7r7fHoRlEe by Michael 
Sells. The book contains 35 suras or short 
passages from the Qur’an that deal with 
“moral accountability” and “the experience 
of the divine in the natural world.”
As the summer progressed and students 
found out about the actual nature of the 
summer reading program, the inevitable 
fireworks erupted. People made claims 
regarding violation of church and state and 
infringement upon the First Amendment. 
People worried about their ldds being forced 
to read the Qur’an and turning into 
America-hating pro-radical-Islamic terror­
ists, all from a translation of a few chapters 
of a religious book.
Some of these claims bring into glaring 
focus the ignorance of some of these people.
I Joe Glover, president of the Family Policy 
Network, filed a lawsuit against UNC. He 
objected to the book because it does not 
include passages such as 5:51 (which tells 
Muslims to not take Jews and Christians as 
friends) or 9:5 (which tells followers to kill 
non-believers). Had Glover done a little dig­
ging, he would have noticed that 5:51 refers 
to Jews and Christians that mock Muslims 
for their faith, and 9:5 specifically mentions 
idolaters. God in the Judeo-Christian reli­
gion also has a big problem with those idol- 
worshipping fools.
My point is not to defend Islam. Those 
who read my final column last semester 
know that I feel modern-day Islam is in dire
brilliant young minds beaten into submis­
sion and sacrificed for a Lh 97.e J ilufV 
D72luo ranking and the neverending pursuit 
of the almighty dollar. Congrats to the 
ingrates sitting up there in Warner. You’ve 
managed to taint some more lives with your 
foul stench of manipulative power monger- 
ing. How you sleep soundly at night is 
beyond even me. Here’s hoping your coffins 
are lined with hundreds, because there 
won’t be a single person at your funerals. 
That is, of course, unless I feel like pissing on 
a tombstone that day. Quite honestly, I can’t 
wait to meet you in Hell and pay Satan twen­
ty bucks to have you simultaneously sodom­
ized with a pine cone and castrated sans 
morphine for a thousand or so years.
Back to the first-years. Don’t ever think 
that you’re anything more than a number. 
You’re all a bunch of grant-fodder, and the 
more you believe I’m wrong, the worse it’ll 
hurt when you find out I’m right. So put in 
your time, do your job, enjoy yourself, and 
get out of Dodge.
At best, you’re a PR stunt encouraged to 
succeed solely to garner attention. At worst, 
you’re a statistic on the attrition rate so well- 
skirted around by the higher-ups. Oh, you 
were valedictorian? So were a hundred 
other people. Wow, you got a 1600 on your 
SATs? So did two hundred other people. 
Holy tapdancing Christ, you were President 
of NHS? Well pin a rose on your f*cking 
nose. Get over yourself and the horribly pre­
sumptuous notion that you mean anything 
more to the people who run this school than
need of a “reformation” to democratize it, 
allow Islamic-influenced cultures to devel­
op, and enable the Shari’ah to once again 
develop as a legal system. Rather, my point 
is to show that many people upset by this 
matter really have no understanding of the 
issue.
Claims of state support of a religion also 
lack substance. The summer reading pro­
gram provides a common academic experi­
ence for incoming students. UNC provided 
students with a list of questions to guide 
them in their papers. These included ques­
tions about how students viewed Muslims 
before reading the book, how metaphors 
and symbols are used, and whether or not 
students themselves would add or remove 
anything. A few questions even touch upon 
comparing the readings to other religious 
texts people may have read. This hardly con­
stitutes state endorsement of a religion.
If you think supporters of this position are 
hypocritical for being opposed to Bible study 
in schools, think again. Usually, people in 
those situations want the Bible used as the 
foundation for principles or they want the 
Ten Commandments posted in the library 
because the “Founding Fathers were reli­
gious men.” (If you believe this, I refer to 
you “Age of Reason” by Thomas Paine, a 
Founding Father.) This activism is very dif­
ferent from studying a religious text as a sec­
ular academic endeavor.
UNC’s option for those opposed to read­
ing the book also offended people. UNC stat­
ed that if students or their families were 
opposed to reading the Qur’an on religious 
grounds, they could write a paper as to why
cattle do to their farmers. You’re walking 
dollar signs.
“Why does he say this?” you ask. “What 
could have possibly made him form these 
opinions?” you wonder. Over the past three 
years, I’ve witnessed no less than four hun­
dred thousand acts of hopeless idiocy and 
shameless greed perpetrated by our fine 
University. Hell, in the last year, I’ve person­
ally seen them botch two clear-cut sexual 
assault cases, reinstate the charter of an 
organization who could not have violated 
more rules if they’d collectively pissed on 
Andrew Carnegie himself, allow for a sordid 
misappropriation of funds by the very stu­
dents they trust to disperse said funds indis­
criminately, and fund any number of ven­
tures simply because they put the University 
an inch closer to GW and his seething Nazi- 
esque breed of “New Americans.”
Until this summer, all of these violations 
had fallen under the umbrella of “CMU and 
its administrators functioning as a bunch of 
rich, white, upper-class males.” But a few 
months ago, they came after me. Two sepa­
rate incidents come to mind. The first 
occurred on May 18. After walking a friend 
home across a campus that has become 
increasingly unsafe in the wake of roughly a 
dozen recent physical assaults, I was 
stopped and accosted by six Carnegie 
Mellon police officers simply because I did­
n’t take kindly to being shouted at while 
walking harmlessly across the football field.
See WELCOME, page A10
they were opposed to it. Some people like 
Glover felt this amounted to religious stig­
ma; non-Muslims would be forced to stand 
before people and declare themselves.
This is of little concern. As UNC has stat­
ed, there is no academic penalty whatsoever 
for refusing to read the book, write a paper, 
or attend a discussion group.
What I find frightening is the fact that 
some people are so insecure in their faith or 
scared of different opinions that they will 
refuse to read ir. Even more ghastly is the 
phrase “or their families.” These are young 
adults going to college. Families need to 
learn that little Johnny or Jane is going to 
see and experience things that may chal­
lenge their beliefs. Burying one’s head in the 
sand does not constitute higher learning.
The only fault I find with the program is 
that they are essentially studying the Qur’an 
in a vacuum. All religion takes place within 
cultural contexts. To study the Qur’an with­
out studying Mohammed’s life, the tribal 
culture of the Middle East, or Islam’s rela­
tionship to Judaism and Christianity (or 
vice-versa) is like studying the mathematics 
of physics without understanding what 
properties like mass mean in the real world.
In the end, I’m sure nothing major will 
come of this. People won’t be brainwashed, 
and many will forget about the issue when 
UNC picks a new controversial book for next 
year. But maybe somebody will learn some­
thing.

Confidence lacking The Muppets take the media and our hearts
in Bush’s presidency
and leadership ability
; Nasser Mohieddin Abukhdeir
“L think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier 
tci answer questions. I can't answer your question.”
— President George Walker Bush, October 4, 2000
President George W. Bush’s first term has seen tragedy and 
controversy. From the events of September 11, countless big 
business scandals, and foreign relations disasters, it’s obvious 
that our country needs strong leadership that can make 
tough decisions for what is best for the country. The 
President’s fluctuating rhetoric, almost daily changes in posi­
tions on key issues, and a lack of solidarity between him and 
his Cabinet send conflicting signals to the American public 
and the world. This behavior is especially relevant regarding 
the many paths President Bush is currently taking with 
American domestic and foreign policy A look into his past 
might reveal some motivations behind his current decisions.
The President himself admits his alcohol addiction earlier 
in his life, and, at the age of 30, he was convicted of drunk 
driving. In another incident in 1972, Bush, without any previ­
ous history of charity work, volunteered for over a year in a 
community service program for troubled youths in a Houston 
ghetto. That year stands as the only charity work he has ever 
done. This year of community service, though, had nothing 
to; do with charity work. Instead, it was part of a subversive 
plan possibly involving string-pulling by Bush’s father, former 
President George Bush Sr., to evade formal charges of 
cocaine use after being arrested for this earlier offense that 
yqar. While Bush has denied this formally, he did openly 
admit to his cocaine abuse prior to 1974.
•Bush’s actions to avoid the Vietnam War draft are also in 
question, but what he is guilty of is indirectly avoiding com­
bat duty by pulling strings to get into the National Guard. In 
1968, shortly before losing his student draft deferment sta­
tus, Bush applied and was accepted into the National Guard. 
There were over 100,000 men ahead of him on the waiting 
list, but Bush was given special treatment. This meant that 
another man was destined to take his place in Vietnam, at a 
time when over 350 Americans were losing their lives every 
wfeek in the war. Bush’s history in the Texas Air Guard is rich 
with privileged treatment too. He took a two- month vacation 
during election season three times during his five year duty. 
Bmsh was also specially appointed to 2nd Lieutenant without 
attending a rigorous Officer Candidate School. This also 
made him eligible for flight school even though his aptitude 
test scores were far below average. While the National Guard 
servicemen could still be called to active duty, Bush was 
assigned to an aircraft being phased out of the Air Force at 
the time, which meant that he was not eligible to see active 
duty. Then, shockingly, from May 1972 to May 1973, he did 
not even bother to show up. This lack of attendance suspi­
ciously began a month after it was announced that drug tests 
would be included in routine physicals. Bush saw no discipli­
nary action and was even honorably discharged, ten months 
before his six year commitment was finished!
Bush's business career is as morally perplexing. After start­
ing a small oil company in the late ‘70s, it was bought out 
while experiencing problems in the early ‘80s. Bush was 
made president of the purchasing company, Spectrum 7 
Energy Corporation, which in turn saw trouble two years 
after Bush took the helm. Similarly, Spectrum 7 was bought 
out by a larger company, Harken Energy Corporation, which 
also added Bush to its Board of Directors, gifted him over 
$200,000 in Harken stock, and allowed him to purchase more 
stock at forty cents on the dollar — all this after he had 
recently driven two companies into the ground. The catch is, 
shortly after, Harken itself underwent suspiciously good 
times. The company received a $25 million stock offering 
from an Arkansas bank (headed by a major contributor to 
Bush’s 2000 presidential campaign), won a contract for off­
shore drilling from Bahrain (beating out Amoco, without hav­
ing any experience in offshore drilling whatsoever), and had 
a board member invited several times to sit in on high-level 
foreign policy meetings in the White House with Bush’s 
father, who was then President. This leads to another shady 
move by Bush, his selling of Harken stocks two months before 
Iraq started the Gulf War. President Bush Sr. received a secret 
State Department memo, a month before his son sold his 
stock, saying that Saddam Hussein, dictator of Iraq, was plan­
ning something and implying that oil prices would be affect­
ed by conflict in the region.
In conclusion, one must wonder if our current president 
adequately represents the American morals and values we 
hold so paramount. Just one of the many unforgivable 
breaches of conduct that our not-so-honorable Commander 
in Chief has committed is enough to wonder how he actually 
was elected into office. It is our duty as American citizens to 
be aware of the character of our leaders, and we should 
undertake this responsibility with vigor.

Terrorists may have attempted other­
wise, but history will remember the 
Muppets as the ones who took 
Manhattan. Therefore, even with 
Muppets creator Jim Henson dead for 
over a decade, it should come as no sur­
prise that Muppets, and indeed many 
varieties of puppets, are still prominent. 
With the Kermit-voiced Shakira’s 
“Underneath Your Clothes” all over the 
airwaves and suHE- gHE-7ue the new hit 
show on Comedy Central, puppets are 
omnipresent in the media. Consequently, 
formerly friendly emo bands are at odds, a 
Muppet with HIV is being treated as a mir­
acle drug, and more so than ever, it ain’t 
easy bein’ green.
The “Emo Puppet Wars,” as dubbed by 
MTV News, caught the attention of many 
music fans. Weezer and Saves The Day 
toured together earlier in the year, but 
this summer the two had Muppetational 
videos so similar that it was difficult for 
both to woo the same target audience. 
Weezer’s video for “Keep Fishin” featured 
Miss Piggy seducing the band’s drummer 
Pat Wilson, Animal filling in behind the 
kit, and Kermit, Gonzo, and Fozzy singing 
back-up vocals. This opportunity fulfilled 
a “childhood dream” for Weezer, who said 
in a press release that “The Muppets can 
really rock!”
The fun of “Keep Fishin” wouldn’t have 
been so challenged if not for Saves The 
Day’s “Freakish,” which also included a 
cast of Muppet-like characters. “I think 
they’re probably both good and unique 
videos that have their own things going 
for them, Muppets or no Muppets,” 
opined STD bassist Eben D’Amico in an 
MTV News article. “I think there’s enough 
puppets to go around for everybody.” As 
the world’s appetite for puppets is infinite, 
Weezer and STD’s battle at least does not 
appear to be a crisis.
When an STD is a deadly illness rather 
than another band in a tired subgenre, 
though, it can generate devastating trou­
bles, as with the AIDS epidemic in South
iocXt0\y o@ gS0 2av H0s\os iovrOsy
Weezer collaborated with The Muppets this summer in their video for “Keep Fishin,” ignit­
ing a battle with former tourmates Saves The Day. Apparently, having multiple 
Muppetational videos is controversial.
Africa. Muppets again made the news this 
summer when Sesame Workshop, the 
parent organization of both h7eHd7 hou77o 
and its South African offshoot kH-HfHER 
h7eHd7c announced that an HIV-positive 
character will be introduced to the show 
this autumn. The Muppet, a five-year-old 
female, will be a monster like Elmo and 
Grover. “She’ll be lively, alert, friendly, 
outgoing, and HIV-positive,” said Sesame 
Workshop vice president Joel Schneider. 
The means of contraction will not be 
taboos like unsafe sex or IV drug use, but 
rather a blood transfusion or childbirth. 
The aim of the character is to teach aware­
ness of the disease, and compassion and 
acceptance for those inflicted by it.
The AIDS epidemic in South Africa is 
one of the most severe in the world. 
According to the United Nations, five mil­
lion South Africans have HIV/AIDS, 20 
percent of the population; more than six 
million will likely be infected by 2005. 
Last year, AIDS was responsible for 
360,000 deaths in the country. Making 
matters even worse, South African 
President Thabo Mbeki thinks that AIDS 
may not even be caused by HIV. Also, 
South Africa won’t see most of the US’s 
upcoming $500 million in aid until 2004. 
In the interim, other means of fighting the 
disease must be present at all levels of 
society, including entertainment and edu­
cation.
The revelation of an HIV-positive 
Muppet was met with mixed reactions
from across the American political spec­
trum. h7eHd7 hou77o has no plans, though, 
to include the character in the American 
show in the near future. The Muppet’s 
role will be confined, at least for now, to 
the South African show. h7eHd7 hou77o 
teaches important values, such as not iso­
lating those who are different and willing­
ness to accept and play with such people. 
Critics claim that h7eHd7 hou77o should 
provide a haven of innocence for children, 
but kH-HfHER h7eHd7 targets an older audi­
ence than its American counterpart. 
While healthy Muppets are arguably 
futile, sickly and socially responsible ones 
should at least not be criticized. 
Recognizing the prominence of AIDS in 
South Africa is commendable, especially 
for h7eHd7 hou77o,
With puppets infiltrating our airwaves 
and hearts, the current Muppetational 
craze will endure for quite a while, unlike 
the short-lived fad of emo. The Jim 
Henson Company and FOX are developing 
a primetime Muppet series, while NBC is 
producing a Muppet movie for the holiday 
season. From emo and epidemics to the 
unforeseen, puppets are clearly the in- 
thing.

WELCOME, from page A9
Evidently, they had nothing better to do 
than send six officers to roll a drunk on his 
way to bed.
I really believe that they get off on this. 
Hell, I guess I would too if I were forced to 
carry around a loaded firearm with little, 
if any, hope of being able to use it. That 
type of frustration just builds up, you 
know. That, coupled with the knowledge 
that you couldn’t find something better to 
do with your life than perpetually ruin a 
good time must really wear on a person. 
In my weaker moments, I almost feel 
sorry for them.
At any rate, after sending me on my 
way, citation in hand, the arresting officer 
saw fit to call my parents’ home and 
divulge the previous evening’s events to 
my fifteen-year-old brother. I can’t hon-

On the other hand, if JFC continues 
to use budget cuts to block Tartan 
efforts at improvement because cer­
tain past stories were less than accu­
rate, I’m going to stroll into one of 
their meetings with an eight-inch 
hunting knife and carve me a few slabs 
of unethical swine. Despite what you 
see floors 4-6 of Warner doing, this 
isn’t a “you scratch my back and I'll 
scratch yours” type of deal.
estly say that I know what standard oper­
ating procedure is in a situation such as 
this, but I’m fairly certain that wasn’t it. 
Then again, what else can you really 
expect from a man who has to mainline 
Viagra just to get out of bed and look in 
the mirror every morning? At least the 
Police Department handled my subse­
quent complaint case in a timely and effi­
cient manner (three and a half months).
Oh, but it doesn’t stop there. A few days 
prior to this mess, I was informed that 
Campus Police were investigating me for a 
separate offense. Apparently, a few stu­
dents — to whom the notion of the First 
Amendment must seem supremely for­
eign — reported to Student Life that I had 
made “terroristic threats” in my last col­
umn of the semester. In short, our Joint 
Funding Committee enjoys doling out 
dollars to the organizations it likes and 
ignoring the pleas of the ones it doesn’t. 
But that’s for another time. Anyway, this 
accusation prompted many fun meetings 
between myself and people with titles like 
“Student Activities Advisor” and 
“Community Standards Supervisor.” (Yes, 
these positions actually exist, and yes, you 
pay their salaries.)
Thus, I had this mess hanging over my 
head for a solid three months before I got 
a phone call from the “Assistant Dean of 
Student Affairs” who let me know that 
this “intense, precise” three-month inves­
tigation had cleared me of any wrongdo­
ing. So that’s that.
And while I must say the idea of walk­
ing into a University Disciplinary 
Committee hearing and dealing on any­
one who remotely entertained the notion 
that this was a legitimate gripe did entice 
me, I was spared much inconvenience 
when they rolled over and apologized.
Oh, and as far as those upstanding stu­
dents who wish to remain anonymous for 
fear of coming across as someone with an 
opinion, I want to thank you for propagat­
ing this insultingly juvenile and ultimate­
ly fruitless crackdown. You’ve wasted an 
inordinate amount of time, money, and 
manpower because you did your jobs 
poorly, I called you on it, and you held a 
grudge. Next time talk to me personally. 
Cowering behind the Police Department 
and Student Life just makes me angrier. 
Better luck next time, you lifeless slugs.
As I sit here contemplating the merits of 
a countersuit for harassment and false 
accusations, I’m forced to wonder how a 
legitimate university — even this one — 
could take seriously such a foolish attack 
on someone who just wanted to speak his 
mind. CMU loves free speech when it’s 
about a Lobster Man or kb7 4HAREH 
TlElflAp7e, Those things don’t rock the 
boat oll much. But when a journalist 
brings to light gross abuses of power by 
elected student officials, he’s sat on and 
beaten. So tread lightly, kids. And hope 
that when you're in trouble, you have a 
long list of smart, capable people to back 
you up like I did. And make damn sure 
that you’re twice the vicious bastard your 
attackers fear you are.
I’m out of space and nearly out of beer, 
so off I go. Best of luck with classes. Don’t 
give the fascists the satisfaction of kicking 
you out because you brought down the 
aggregate GPA they tout so highly above 
their swollen heads.

THE TARTAN • AUGUST 26, 2002
Q&A: Tartans head coach Lackner talks about football at CMU, goals for new season
LACKNER, from page A14
today, and had a great block and a 
I nice post pattern. He just went up
I over someone and caught the ball.
That was really nice to see.
; And Brian Vest, who’s the backup 
tight end, he’s the kind of kid who can 
play tight end or split out and be a 
split end, whereas Scott Jubeck is 
basically a tight end, period. Brian 
C gives us a little flexibility, some more 
C options.
TT: Who stretches the field like for­
mer receiver Mike McLaughlin did in 
i 2000, and Smelko did on occasion?
We think that Kay has the speed to 
jdo it, and sophomore Josh Becker has 
been hurt most of camp with a ham­
string. He made some key catches in 
that Chicago game last year. So we 
think we have some good athletes out 
there, who’re going to cause people to 
take notice. And they’d better take 
notice, because all of them have cer­
tain strengths, and they all have the 
ability to catch the ball and do some­
thing with it.
TT: Placekicker Mike Palmer had 
some trouble last year with accuracy. 
Why not hire a kicking coach? Is that 
ever a consideration?
No, not really. It really wasn’t 
something we had discussed. I don’t 
¡want to blame the kid, and I don’t 
jwant to blame the coach. I think it 
was a situation where as the year 
went on, it got very frustrating for 
Mike. It was nice to see him start the 
^ear out on a positive note with the 
Scrimmage today. I think that having 
a successful kicker is the ability to 
block things out and concentrate on 
what you have to do.
TT: So maybe Mike’s problems last 
year can be attributed to mental 
breakdowns and not kicking flaws?
There may have been some kicking 
flaws now and again, but I think kick­
ing is about fifty percent physical, 
and half mental. You can get on a roll, 
and just have great confidence, and 
there are times when you struggle. 
Mike will be the first one to tell you
that he struggled last year, but I think 
he’s come in with a good attitude this 
year.
TT: I wanted to ask you about the 
Wing-T offense. When did it start at 
Carnegie Mellon?
Chuck put that in in 1983,1 believe. 
We had an abundance of good backs 
at that time and he wanted to get into 
a three-back offense, and was debat­
ing whether to go to a wishbone-type 
thing, or a variation of it. He went to 
the Wing-T, and ran that for a couple 
of years.
Then I was hired as head coach in 
1986, and I think Rich Erdelyi has 
done great things with the Wing-T 
offense. He’s expanded on what was 
originally put in. He’s put in a lot of 
innovations, and I think it’s an excel­
lent offense for the kinds of kids that 
we have.
TT: Could Chris Wong be the first 
Asian to start on CMU’s football 
team?
I don’t know. I don’t look at Chris 
Wong as an Asian, I look at him as a 
player. I think Chris is a great kid, and 
Jonathan Chu [junior defensive back] 
is a nice young man, and also Julian 
Chen [sophomore defensive tackle], 
and we have a freshman this year, Zhi 
Qiao. He’s a very tall kid, and I think 
the day’s going to come where they’ll 
get their opportunities. I don’t look 
on the guy, whether he’s white, black, 
Asian, Christian, Jewish, we just look 
at whether they’re good players.
TT: Do you think it’s difficult for your 
team to block out that they don’t have 
the support from the fans or the col­
lege?
I think our kids would love to come 
out and see the stands filled. And I 
think that the campus community, if 
they don’t come out and support the 
football team, I think they’re missing 
something that’s really special. I 
would hope that they would give the 
team a look on September 7, against 
Bethany. But once you put on the hel­
met and the pads, you kind of block 
out the crowd. I think these kids 
aren’t playing for anything but their
team. So if we have one person in the 
stands, it’s a shame, but I think it 
doesn’t necessarily matter to the kids. 
Of course, I think they’d like to go out 
and see the stadium seats filled.
TT: CMU’s pretty successful in foot­
ball. Why do you think it hasn’t really 
caught fire here?
There are a lot of kids on campus, 
and a lot of things to do, and different 
interests, whether it be in the fine 
arts, or the field of robotics. I’m not so 
sure the kids are just sitting around 
their rooms — I think they’re proba­
bly keeping busy, and I think if they 
came out and saw a game, I think 
they’d come back.
TT: Do you think there needs to be 
more support from the administra­
tion to pull something like that off?
I don’t know. The administration 
can’t force them to come to a game. 
But I think [Dean] Mike Murphy and 
the Student Affairs office do publicize 
our games some. I know they publi­
cized our scrimmage through the 
Orientation program. But CMU’s a 
diverse community, with lots of dif­
ferent interests. I still think that if the 
staff, the faculty, and the students 
came out and saw what a fine product 
we put out, they’d come back.
TT: When the University of Rochester 
leaves the conference, what does that 
mean for the future of UAA football?
Well, I think it’s very discouraging 
to us, to be honest. The UAA is a great 
conference and we as coaches sup­
port the conference. We like the trav­
el we can provide, and the competi­
tion. It’s been great for the soccer, 
basketball, and swim teams. But 
there are only five football-playing 
teams, and it’s going to be down to 
four. That means three conference 
games — and that’s pretty ridiculous.
TT: Can they [University Presidents 
and conference officials] find more 
teams?
I would hope they would, but the 
problem the UAA has put themselves 
in is that the profile of the school they
Marietta’s quarterback just eludes the grasp of defensive end Phil Clingman. The junior played a great Saturday scrimmage. '
jen uuners/rnoio nuiior

want in the conference is so restric­
tive. They’re looking for a major 
research university in a major city 
committed to Division III athletics. 
There are probably only 10 or 12 in 
the United States that have that par­
ticular profile.
Hopldns was in on a part-time basis 
at one point, then pulled out. MIT 
never joined, and Tufts made 
inquiries to the UAA and was denied. 
So what are we supposed to do if they 
don’t change the profile somewhat? A 
four-team conference for football is 
just ridiculous.
You can’t even get an automatic 
bid. You need seven or eight teams in 
a conference to get an automatic bid. 
And scheduling is a nightmare. Six 
out-of-conference games now, and in 
a couple years we’ll be. scheduling 
seven. It becomes very difficult.
TT: If there’s a four-team conference, 
would you suggest that Carnegie 
Mellon withdraw from UAA football?
No, I don’t think we’ll do that. CMU 
is a founding member of the UAA, 
and it’s such a great conference for 
everybody else. It’s meeting the 
needs of many of the sports. We hope 
they could get together and find ways 
to bring people into the UAA just for 
football, or possibly team up with 
another conference to help us with 
scheduling. If we team up with anoth­
er conference, we could have our con­
ference games on certain dates, and 
our other dates we could schedule 
between the two conferences.
TT: No chance, then, on an all-sports 
conference of D-III research universi­
ties?
I wish [Johns] Hopkins and MIT 
were in it, personally. I think that’s 
where they ought to be. I think it’s 
perfect. The other teams in the con­
ference other than Rochester have 
had some real positive experiences 
within the conference. I hope the 
administrators would be able to find 
a solution to the problem for football.
TT: This is the third straight year that 
Washington University in St. Louis is 
the preseason favorite to win the 
UAA, and for quite some time it was 
Carnegie Mellon and only Carnegie 
Mellon. What’s changed that’s given 
Wash U or the University of Chicago a 
competitive edge versus CMU?

I think that one thing that Wash U 
has is that they’re almost an island in 
the middle of the United States. If you 
want a great academic research uni­
versity in the central part of the 
United States, where else are you 
going to go? So they kind of have a 
lock on those kids looking for that 
kind of university. And they have an 
incredible commitment to their ath­
letic program, with their facilities and 
everything that goes along with it.
And Chicago, I think they’re build­
ing some new facilities, and their 
commitment is very strong, and 
they’re in an area with a huge popula­
tion, so they have an area where they 
can really recruit hard.
And when'you look at Carnegie 
Mellon, we’re here in Pittsburgh. Five 
hours from us is Penn, four hours 
from us is Rochester, five hours from 
us is Johns Hopkins, six hours from us 
is Princeton. We’ve got Lehigh, 
Lafayette, Bucknell. We’ve got a lot of 
competition within about a five- or 
six-hour radius of us.
So a kid in Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, New 
York, they’ve got a lot of academic 
options. Whereas out west, Chicago is 
the best school for D-III athletics in 
the Chicago area, and Wash U is the 
only game in town in the whole cen­
tral part of the United States.
Both schools have made a major 
commitment to their athletic pro­
grams, in terms of facilities, staffing.
TT: What about financial aid? Are 
they [Chicago and Wash U] beating 
CMU there?
Well, Wash U has an incredible 
endowment, and let’s just say they’re 
very generous with their aid package. 
They’re very generous, and even
Chicago tends to complain about; 
them. What are you going to do? It 
makes it pretty tough when you go> 
against those folks.jjTT: I don’t think I have any more; 
questions. Is there anything else* 
you’d like to add?IGI just think you asked a lot of ques-| 
tions about the offense. I think that» 
you mentioned a couple of kids on th& 
defensive line, but we’re returning a| 
lot of good linebackers. I know we lost 
[Mike] Hubbert from last year’s team, 
but we’re returning a lot of good line­
backers. We’re returning our sec­
ondary, we’re losing Jay Nichols and 
Jason Morris, who were kind of part- 
time players last year, but we’re! 
returning all our starters. I think we, 
have some very fine athletes back 
there, and I think that we have the1 
nucleus to have a good football team.
I hope our kicking game comes; 
along, and is as good as it was today, 
and I hope it will be for the rest of the' 
year, because I think that’s one of the! 
things we did need to improve upon; 
— hopefully we are doing that.
I think [defensive cooridnator 
Terry] Bodnar’s done a great job too,; 
with the defensive package. The kids! 
believe in him, they believe in thej 
package. I think we have the potential! 
to have a real nice football team thisi 
year.
TT: And beat Wash U?
I hope so. I think Wash U’s coaches, 
do a great job too, and their kids are 
prepared and ready to play every year 
as well. But our kids will be ready to, 
play that day, and we’ll go out and! 
give great effort. I would think we 
have the potential to play with those; 
people this year and beat them.

MLB can’t afford 
another stoppageFootball makes lively start in scrimmage with Marietta
20@@ ic%%0X\bySoto AdatoX
Adam Urbanczyk (34) carries two tacklers on one of the team’s staple rush plays, buck sweep. Last year, Urbanczyk tallied 15 touchdowns. Right, a Tartan lineman snuffs out Marietta wideout Brian Hanes.
Last Saturday the Marietta 
Pioneers came to Gesling Stadium to 
take on The Tartans in the first foot­
ball action of the year. Although they 
only scrimmaged, it was an impor­
tant day for both teams’ regular sea­
son preparations.
The scrimmage began with the 
teams playing two full quarters in a 
game-like situation. After that, each 
team alternated taking a series of 10 
plays from the opposing team’s 10 
yard line.
In the first part of the scrimmage, 
the Tartans looked tough as they 
converted two of their first three dri­
ves into touchdowns. Senior fullback 
Adam Urbanczyk set up the Tartans 
for their first score, bulldozing a 
stunned Marietta player on an 
impressive run. He punched in the 
first touchdown from three yards 
out.
The second touchdown came from 
junior Lane Martin with a short run, 
as he continued to prove that the 
CMU fullbacks aren’t easy to bring 
down.
Who’s next: Bethany College 
(0-0) versus Carnegie Mellon 
(0-0) 1 pm, Saturday, September 7 
on WRCT, 88.3 FM.
Last meeting: In 2000, Bethany 
faced their toughest test of the sea­
son in week three at Gesling 
Stadium. The Tartans came into 
the game ranked 19th in the coun­
try and winners of 12 consecutive 
games against Bethany, but the 
Bison ground game gained 296 
yards as Bethany upset CMU 
27-16. CMU leads the all-time 
series 26-6.
The skinny: When Chris Snyder 
patrols the Bethany sideline, it will 
his first head coaching job. The 
Bison will also switch from a 4-4 to 
a 4-3 defense because of depth in 
the secondary.
Look for: Senior Will Anderson 
(132 yards, two TDs in 2000 con­
test) was a first team All-PAC selec­
tion last year. Junior linebacker
Steve Ochap was a first-team 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
selection last year with 53 tackles.
Result: Playing your first game at 
home is ever so critical, especially 
against a formidable foe like 
Bethany. CMU is waiting for the 
Bison — the message on the locker 
room white board at the Marietta 
game read “Hate Bethany.” It prob­
ably says the same thing in 
Bethany, WV. Enough said. Tartans 
20, Bethany 17.
Team notes: The Kilties were 
picked second in the UAA presea­
son coaches poll. The Tartans still 
hold seven UAA titles, the last com­
ing in 1997. Coach Rich Lackner 
expects starting offensive tackle 
Chad Zimmerman to have recov­
ered from a hamstring pull and be 
ready for the opener. Junior 
Zimmerman and senior Brandon 
Foth are the only two returning 
starters from the offensive line. 
However, center Bob Barton did 
see substantial playing time last 
season.
Q&A: Football head coach Rich Lackner
20@@ ic%%0X\bySoto AdatoX
Rich Lackner, one of The Tartans’ winningest coaches, says his team has what it takes to be the top UAA team this year.
Another September is almost upon 
j us and one of the greatest pennant 
races in the history of baseball may 
be cut short at the end of the week. 
The three-way struggle between 
Oakland, Seattle, and Anaheim 
would not be the only victim of the 
impending players’ strike, but to lose 
such a dramatic race, which would 
be sure to hold baseball fans all over 
the country rapt, is a clear symbol of 
how damaging this strike would be 
to the game. Quite simply, if the 
strike proceeds on the 30th, there 
will be some major changes to Major 
League Baseball as we currently 
know it.
That may sound overdramatic, but 
the truth is that a sport which expe­
riences two work stoppages in an 
eight-year period cannot survive. 
Many fans still have not come back 
since the ’94 strike, which failed to 
accomplish anything but canceling 
the World Series, and another empty 
fall will be too much for all but a few 
die-hard souls.
Both the owners and players real­
ize this, of course, and yet the offer 
presented by the players’ union on 
Saturday was seen as “regressive bar­
gaining” by Rob Manfred, the own­
ers’ chief labor lawyer.
Call me cynical, but that type of 
language doesn’t exactly fill me with 
confidence that an 11th hour deal is 
on the horizon.
The players also want a deal done 
soon because they don’t want to 
appear insensitive by not having 
games on September 11. Sorry, fel­
las, but it’s a little late for that. I, for 
one, find it difficult to believe in the 
sympathies of a union who won’t 
, agree to a strict luxury tax because 
top-end salaries might drop from 
$15 million to $10 million.
Not that the owners are doing any 
better in winning popular support. 
Remember, this is the side headed by 
1 a commissioner who called the All-
¦ Star Game a tie after only two extra 
innings. Quick tangential rant here: I 
haven’t watched an All-Star Game in 
years because I knew that something 
like this would happen eventually. 
The way the game is managed now, 
it’s less like real baseball than a 
spring training game. Absolutely dis­
graceful.
If there’s any sort of silver lining to 
all of this, it’s that a strike might 
finally convince commissioner Selig 
to step in and make some firm 
changes. At least one owner has pro­
posed that if the players strike, a 
firm salary cap should be imple­
mented and the union can either 
take it or leave it for replacement 
players. While nothing so drastic is 
likely to happen, the owners would 
be well-advised to take the opportu­
nity to do something, such as go 
ahead with contraction, while the 
players worry about how long they 
can stay away.
Of course, all of this discussion is 
moot since all we fans can do is sit 
back, wait, and see what happens. 
Yes, there are those trying to orga­
nize “strike back” boycotts in the 
hope that the moneygrubbers will 
learn not to mess with us, but none 
of that can take effect until the strike 
ends, when (if a miracle happens) a 
lasting, working agreement will have 
been made. Here’s hoping.

TT: The question on every Tartan 
football fan’s mind is, who will be 
the starting quarterback?
We have two seniors who’ve done 
a nice job in camp. Sebastian 
Smelko played wideout last year for 
us, and backed up the quarterback. 
He’s had a very good camp, and 
done a nice job. Right now, he’s pro­
jected to be the starter. We have 
Mike Wykosky, who’s a darn good 
football player too, and we’ve got a 
couple of young kids who’ve done
real well.
TT: What kinds of differences can 
fans expect between having Eric 
Zimpfer (2001 Tartan quarterback) 
running the offense and Smelko 
running the offense?
Zimpfer ran the offense and did a 
nice job, but the thing that Eric had 
was that both his junior and senior 
year, he had shoulder problems the 
second half of the season. So hope­
fully, we can keep our quarterbacks 
healthy. Sometimes, you wait and 
see what they can do. They’re going 
to make some mistakes, naturally, 
but hopefully they run the offense 
the way it’s designed to be run. 
Every one of those kids is coach- 
able, so every rep they take is going 
to make them better.
TT: Are there “wrinkles” you’ve put 
into the offense?
Well, our offense is a very multi­
ple type of offense, and contains 
lots of misdirection, lots of different 
motions, lots of different sets. I
think it’s full of wrinkles, to tell you 
the truth. As coach [Rich] Erdelyi 
starts to see how the offense begins 
to gel, I’m sure he’s going to add a 
few things that he thinks they do 
well, and maybe take some things 
out that they don’t do as well. We 
hope to be balanced, to be able to 
run the ball and throw the ball.
TT: If Smelko moves from wideout 
to QB, who is going to play receiv­
er?
We’ve done a few things. We’ve 
moved Chris Kay from running back 
to wideout, and that was very good 
for us. Chris is a very good athlete, 
and has done a nice job catching the 
ball, and was having a nice camp, 
but collided in a pass skeleton drill 
and had a very minor concussion. 
So we took him out for a couple 
days as a precaution.
Chris Wong, who’s only a sopho­
more, had a nice scrimmage today, 
and Kevin Manley, who’s just a 
freshman, had a nice scrimmage
See LACKNER, page A13
The third scoring strike for CMU 
came with a field goal from junior 
Mike Palmer, set up by multiple com­
pletions from senior quarterback 
Sebastian Smelko. Palmer played 
well throughout the contest, kicking 
off three times for touchbacks and 
going 4 for 4 through the uprights.
Other bright moments in the 
scrimmage included a blocked punt 
by senior Nick Cecchini and a deep 
completion from senior quarterback 
Mike Wykosky to first-year Kevin 
Manley.
Of course, there were also the 
flubs that accompany early-year 
scrimmages. CMU fumbled the ball 
twice, there were occasional break­
downs in the secondary and at times 
there was confusion on the field. All 
of which head coach Rich Lackner 
believes will be fixable.
“The guys played hard, and gave 
lots of effort,” said Lackner. “Sure, 
there are some mistakes that we 
need to correct, but we’ll work on 
those.”
Lackner would have liked to get a 
look at more players, but was unable 
to due to weather and injuries.

ing to see the “Big Nasty D” maim the 
overhyped Steve Spurrier Machine in 
the only half that counts for a 
respectable team?
2. Speaking of Steve “It feels really 
to good to win a preseason game” 
Spurrier, I give him until week three 
when he finds out that the NFL is not 
the SEC. Sorry Steve, there are no 
Vanderbilts in this league (well, 
maybe Cincinnati).
3. Two encouraging signs for 
Steeler fans: The Jaw (Bill Cowher) 
and the Mouth (Lee Flowers) are 
both in midseason form. Although his 
tenure with the Steelers is most likely 
over at the end of the year, Flowers 
certainly has a future in prognostica­
tion. He called Tampa Bay “paper 
champs” and saw the Bucs get embar­
rassed in the playoffs. Said the Fun ’n 
Gun won’t run ... it won’t.
4. I like HBO’s series Hard Knocks 
Camp with The Cowboys. If anything, 
it makes you hate Dallas more. They 
actually think they can win? There 
should be some sort of prefix like 
“From the warped mind of Jerry 
Jones, HBO presents.... ”
5. It is nice to see that millionaire 
professional football players have 
worse pick-up moves than a bunch of 
drunken frat boys. Seeing now ex- 
Cowboys receiver Richmond Flowers 
karaoke “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” 
reminds me of the good’ ol days at 
Beta when at 2 am the ’80s music 
would start. The singing was bad. 
The chicks (either too drunk or too 
fat) were worse.
6. Speaking of Beta, CMU’s football 
team will go 8-2 and earn at least a 
share of the UAA title.
7. How long do you think it will 
take for baseball owners and players 
to realize nobody cares? I’ll give to, 
oh, say September 5. What they don’t
before all the teams had a chance to 
rotate in.
“It’s a shame that the weather had 
to cut us short,” said Lackner. “We 
were planning on rotating more 
guys, and that’s too bad. We’re a little 
bit nicked up too, but it’s nothing too 
serious. It’s mostly bruises that 
should heal pretty soon.”
With lots of seniors returning, 
Lackner is optimistic about the direc­
tion that the team is headed.
“We’ve got great senior leadership 
out there,” said Lackner. “We’ve got a 
lot of returning players who have a 
lot of games under their belt. The 
only question is whether they can 
have that special chemistry, and 
that’s starting to develop.”
The Tartans’ first game of the sea­
son is on Saturday, September 7, at 
Gesling Stadium. The Bethany Bison 
will come to town for a 1 pm game.
The Tartans and the Bison last 
faced off in the 2000 season — their 
2001 matchup was cancelled in the 
wake of September 11 — and the 
Bison overcame the 19th-ranked 
Tartans for a 27-16 upset. It was the 
Tartans’ first loss to the Bison in 12 
straight matchups.
realize is that because of their ass- 
backwards way of running the busi­
ness of baseball, baseball season ends 
in June for most cities.
8. You heard it here first. This year 
because of realignment in the NFL an 
8-8 team will make the playoffs 
while a 10-6 or 11-5 team will be left 
at home. And then the parity lovers 
will have won. Parity for all!
9. Parity is a sham. The Dynasty is 
the greatest thing in sports. It is sus­
tained excellence over time, which 
should be the goal for all sports fran­
chises. Nay, you say? I’ve compiled a 
little list to prove my point.
Dynasty: Pete Rozelle 
Parity: Paul Tagliabue
Dynasty: The 1970s Steelers

THE TARTAN’S ART AND CULTURE MAGAZINE
Volume i, Issue i August 26, 2002

---------------------------------------------------

letter from the editor
And so it begins...
In your hands is the first issue of a brand new but long-time-coming magazine section of The Tartan. Inside you’ll find 
the music, film, and art stories that held together the Arts&Living and Entertainment sections in the past. These sections 
no longer exist on their own; after months of discussion, debate, meetings, and procrastination, we’ve finally determined 
that the love child of those sections is called Pillbox.
I suppose we were aiming for a name that connotes something hip and innovative, to represent the total physical for­
mat change as well as the general attitude toward the paper. What we ended 
up with is a bit spontaneous but hopefully still leads readers to some idea of 
vital content.
Our purposes in collapsing the sections are two-fold; the old system left a 
very blurred line between the sections, and so left a lot of stories uncovered.
We hope that clearer divisions of content will help us get the goods and get 
them well, and particularly give us room for some bigger feature stories, too.
The other primary reason for changing the paper so drastically is that it just 
makes more sense to keep the news on the broadsheet pages and to let the 
arts, campus living, and entertainment spread out on tabloid sized pages. I 
hope you agree, and of course look forward to feedback.
A third major change, which is not immediately apparent, is that The 
Tartan’s literary magazine — Dossier — will no longer exist as a separate pub­
lication. Every other issue of Pillbox will have a Dossier section, which means 
more content printed, more frequently, so submissions are encouraged and 
welcomed.
And on that note, one major Pillbox goal is to be able to offer CMU an authoritative, complete events calendar. Keep 
us informed! We’re finding events on our own, but appreciate getting as many events as possible.

Orientation
they felt
2002: 
the rhythm
OCs guided families around campus in addition to “breaking the ice" for 
first-year students.
Every college freshman has a 
unique experience crossing that 
invisible threshold that separates a 
world of comfortable smiles and 
familiar faces from, an intently that 
holds the unknown in the palm of 
its hands. Common questions of 
“Will I fit in?” “Will I like my pro­
fessor” or “Will I like my room­
mate” surface before he or she 
brings in the last box from the fam­
ily minivan. Nevertheless, there is 
hope for the freshman, especially if 
his or her first step into college is at 
Carnegie Mellon University.
Orientation 2002: Feel the 
Rhythm went into full effect on 
August 20 as Orientation 
Counselors (OCs), Residential 
Assistants (RAs) and Head 
Orientation Counselors (HOCs) 
rounded their designated groups 
up and led them into a plethora of 
ice breaker events that would ease 
their first-year tensions while also 
show that CMU not only has a tech­
nical, head-in-book side, but also a 
creative outlook that makes its 
Orientation unlike other 
Universities with big events like 
Playfair and House Wars.
“This week gives the students a 
chance to meet people while every­
one is open to it,” said junior com­
puter science major and HOC 
Jennifer Cerully said.
Playfair, the first big ice breaker 
of Orientation, allows the fresh­
man class to run about like ninnies 
as they get acquainted with their 
fellow housemates while forming 
human centipedes and high-fiving 
the entire class. House Wars was a 
event unlike any other as freshmen, 
OCs, RAs, and HOCs rolled around
in the mud to compete for the title 
of the best house.
As the week progressed atten­
dance at orientation events took a 
noticeable dip. First-years Alex 
Fishman of Computer Science and 
Aaron Vanderbeek of CIT both 
noted that while during the first 
two days their attendance was high, 
it fell off as the week progressed. 
When asked how many activities 
they attended overall, they estimat­
ed between 60 and 70 percent.
To senior materials science and 
engineering major Kristin 
Pappacena, who has been an OC for 
three years, this is not surprising.
“Most of my students came [to 
activities] on the first days,” said 
Pappacena, “but as they became 
more confident on campus and with
each other, they began doing more 
things on their own.”
The design for orientation was 
based on this simple premise.
“Attendance tapers off through 
the week,” said Pappacena, “so 
more important programs are 
placed on early days.”
The exact length of orientation 
week is a matter of balancing. Too 
long, and the students will get 
bored. Too short, and there won’t be 
enough time to give necessary 
information. Both students and 
OCs, however, seemed satisfied 
with the present length.
“By the end of the week,” said sen­
ior music major Jara Dorsey, “[the 
first-years are] about as prepared as 
they can be for life on campus.”

Almanac
50 years ago, September 24, 1952 — The dedication of the 
new William Larimer Mellon School of Industrial Administration 
lasted October 2 to October 3. An informal discussion between the 
nation’s most distinguished business administrators, graduate edu­
cators, and researchers was held concerning what pathways of 
research would lead to more effective administration for American 
industry. The school was first founded in 1949 thanks to a six mil­
lion dollar gift from the W.L. and M.T. Mellon Foundation. One 
million was set aside solely for the building and the remaining five 
million went into the schools endowment. The school formally 
opened its doors to 25 pre selected students September of 1950.
25 years ago, September 6, 1977 — The College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences underwent revision in its core cur­
riculum because of accusations that its current state was ineffec­
tive. The new curriculum was constructed through the collabora­
tion of faculty members from various departments within the col­
lege and launched its pilot run on the incoming freshman class. 
The core curriculum would require 16 courses to be taken in the 
freshman and sophomore years. The courses were divided into five 
sections, called clusters, which included the following: 
Fundamental Methods and Skill, Humanistic and Social Value, 
Social Sciences and Choice Processes, Science and Technology, and 
Language and the Arts.10 years ago, August 31, 1992 — ALLIES, a new student 
organization, was developed to provide support for gays, lesbians 
and bisexuals in the community. ALLIES’s ultimate goal is to pro­
vide awareness of homosexuality and heterosexism while also 
decreasing levels of homophobia. The group was formed by third- 
year architecture major Erik Larson. ALLIES members were 
required to learn and teach with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual 
population and make a difference in the world by supporting one 
another.
5 years ago, September 2,1997 — PhD student of genetic pro­
gramming Astro Teller is the author of the science-fiction thriller 
called N—7A7eRec a word meaning “careful examination and inter­
pretation of a text.” The title was said to be very fitting of the book 
because the text is written in email format. With his extensive 
knowledge in computer science, no one suspected such a creative 
streak in Teller. His extensive knowledge in computer science and 
interest in the field of artificial intelligence was the inspiration 
behind his book.
1 year ago, August 27, 2001 — During RoboCup 2001, held at 
the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle from 
August 2 to August 10, Carnegie Mellon’s team, CM Pack ’01 
placed second in the Sony Legged Robot League. Sponsors for 
RoboCup 2001 included Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer 
Science and the and the American Association for Artificial 
Intelligence (AAAI). This artificial simulation of robotic soccer was 
said to help developers learn more about computer interaction 
while also tackling real-world problems.

Signs (2002)
Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Rated PG-13. 
Starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. 
Showing at Squirrel Hill, Waterworks Cinema, 
and Loews Waterfront.
In another attempt to thrill audiences, writer and director M. Night 
Shyamalan offers his most recent project, Signs. Following supernatural 
phenomena-themed blockbusters, Signs matches previous movies made by 
the director, who is known for his ability to frighten viewers without sim­
ply startling them. Shyalmalan smartly uses comprehensive character 
development to make his fictitious fears believable. He leaves much of the 
information to the audience’s imagination, sprinkles in an appropriate 
amount of comic relief, and includes a realistic, quirky cast in his com­
mendable attempt to demonstrate an extraterrestrial visit to planet Earth.
;AVlT pAflH9h., ;s.lhR aIAggERlITR
Mel Gibson plays the difficult role of ex-priest widower Graham Hess, a 
farmer in rural Eastern Pennsylvania. In the wake of his loss of love and 
faith, his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) moves to the neighboring 
property in order to console his grieving brother and aid in the care of his 
young children, Colleen (Patricia Kalember) and Morgan (Rory Culkin). 
Shyalmalan wastes no time in revealing each one’s personality and traits, 
such as Colleen’s finicky taste for clean water and Morgan’s severe asthma. 
The strains on the relationships within the family since the death of Hess’ 
wife are obvious from the opening scene, visible both through shouted out­
bursts and passively as well. The pressure is released slowly as the family 
tries to comprehend the events happening just outside their house.
After an inexplicable design appears in the crops in the middle of Hess’ 
field, news breaks out internationally of similar happenings in cities from 
Mexico City to Jerusalem. The desperate family instantly glues themselves 
to the television, finding out as much possible information before realizing 
their own house could be attacked. Faced with the realization, reached by 
a number of clues, that their property is doomed to be attacked, the broth­
ers quickly board up all the windows and doors and retreat to the basement 
with the children to wait out the invasion.
Shyamalan deserves much credit for trying to integrate fright, drama, 
and humor into Signs, and he does so with some success, yet with some dis­
appointment. He reveals the story chronologically and through flashbacks, 
which leaves plenty of room for mystery and use of imagination. Curiosity 
fuels the desire of the audience to try and discover the motives of the 
aliens, or if they are truly extraterrestrials in the first place. Unfortunately, 
at times, Shyamalan breaks down his wall of secrecy and reveals an unex­
citing detail too explicitly. In this type of movie, the unknown aspects of the 
story are what can make it scary, and some of the realism is unfortunately 
lost when the plot or characters become too blatant.
Above: Graham (Mel Gibson) and brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) faced 
with the unknown.
Still, the director’s light use of comedy adds realism and breaks up what 
would otherwise be a very intense story. His ability to hold the audience’s 
attention is also commendable. While there were key silences throughout 
the film, the dialogue was important and not infused with babble to add 
minutes to make the movie feature-length. Most notably, as seen in his 
other films, Shyamalan has a knack for frightening even the most skeptical 
viewers by forcing them to wonder, “What if?” even for just a moment.
The unique mix of genres that comprise Signs is what makes this movie 
stand out from the slew of intergalactic-themed films released this sum­
mer. If it is possible to ignore this movie’s setbacks and become engrossed 
in the plot of the film, then Signs is certainly worth watching.

Big Al’s 
metal shop
Hello again! It’s been a long, hot summer full of good music. As 
we begin a new semester, let me list some of my summer highlights. 
The top four concerts of the summer were:
4. Dio/Scorpions/Deep Purple, Post Gazette Pavilion 
The mullets, the Camaros, the smell of malt liquor <sigh>, it was 
just like the ’80s all over again! All kidding aside, Ronnie James Dio 
showed why he is the consummate professional, playing everything 
from “Last in Line” to “Holy Diver” to cuts off of his new album, the 
stellar 3RffREA ob7 juHAlE (look for a review soon!). The backing band 
was tight and aside from a banner in the middle, the stage was a no­
frills affair. Klaus Meine’s voice was spot on, they played all the hits, 
and showed all in attendance where hard rock and melody fuse 
together.
3. Judas Priest, Metropol 
Loud. Very, very loud. And good. That about sums up a Priest con­
cert. In fact, I can’t even remember what they opened with, but I can 
say that even with a not-so-new-anymore singer, Priest can still 
deliver the goods live. Don’t get me wrong; it must take some effort 
writhing into the leather pants at that age, but Glenn Tipton and 
K.K. Downing still trade licks like the good oF “British Steel” days. 
The songs from their new album, j7dlfRoRlEc also fall out of the clas­
sic Priest style, but again, they made it work live.
2. David Lee Roth/Sammy Hagar, Post Gazette Pavilion 
Also known as the ex-wives tour, this was a spectacle to see. First 
off was Mr. Lee, in all his finery. Shiny jumpsuit, a hot backing band 
(James Lomenzo on bass — Pride and Glory, anyone?) and all the 
Van Halen hits. That’s it. I’ve waited since I first heard “Panama” to 
see him live, and I loved every minute of it. The man has a lot to say, 
but not too much on stage — although “I wanna see the sun set 
through your plastic beer cups” was a bit deeper than the audience 
understood.
That wasn’t the end, though. I’ve always thought that Sammy 
Hagar was great on his own, but I have to say that I was a bit jealous 
when he took over in VH. Still, the man rocks the house. With a stage 
set up like his Cabo Wabo bar, and plenty of his signature tequila, he 
made the 90+ minute show a party. From “I Can’t Drive” to “Mas 
Tequila,” Hagar showed why he’s still a co-heavyweight champ of 
rock and roll.
1. Down, Cleveland 
Thick-as-sludge riffs, melody, power, inventiveness, they sum up 
all that is great in heavy metal. Add to that the fact they don’t tour 
(it was, after all, a side project, no?) and you have an evening to 
remember. It was surreal — ElfHc their first album, has accompanied 
me wherever I’ve gone. Now, with a new album ’CC1 that takes it even 
further, and a major tour, I wondered if they had taken this magic 
and tried to spread it out too much. After the first notes of opener 
“Lysergik Funeral Procession,” that was all put away. Quite simply, 
Phil Anselmo stalked the stage. He owned it, and he gave a perform­
ance I won’t soon forget.
The first third was from the new album and really just preached to 
the converted. We know it, we love it, we already own it. In the pit, 
out to the back of the hall, we all swarmed joyously in unison to the 
front. It was something I have not seen at a show before, and proba­
bly never will again. As Anselmo growled through “Stone the Crow,” 
it struck me that everyone was singing, smiling, happy, and when 
you think about it, isn’t that what the song is about? And that, to me, 
is the genius of this band. Somehow, they extract all the negative, all 
the frustration of the listener, and leave us with the inner happiness 
we have.
See you next week,
Big Al

Le Tigre
Riot grrl legend Kathleen Hanna’s post-Bikini Kill 
band Le Tigre has been dismissed by many as candy for 
the club kids, since she's all but abandoned the punk 
look, sound, and demeanor. But her ultra-feminist riot 
grrl message hasn’t gotten lost in the canned beats and 
synthesizers.
Tourmates Panty Raid opened their short and amus­
ing set with the singer (wearing slippers, ear muffs, and 
a baseball cap) explaining why they decided to go on 
tour: “Our drummer got sick, the bass player and gui­
tarist broke up, and I had crabs.” The band featured a 
female drummer and five flaming gay boys in short 
shorts — including two members whose sole function 
was to prance around ostentatiously and wear ridicu­
lously short shorts.
Musically, Panty Raid was just funny, with very short 
songs to match the short shorts and a lot of screeching 
“yeah yeah baby” choruses. Their banner was a giant

pair of underwear, and next to the feminist activist 
tables, their merch table featured panties and 7” 
records.
Le Tigre fans tend to be Kathleen Hanna devotees, 
but somebody looking for remnants of Bikini Kill 
stylings will be disappointed at a show. Each song is 
accompanied by a Le Tigre-produced DVD projection 
behind the band — pre-programmed music videos of 
sorts, ranging from footage of a women’s self-defense 
class during the song “On Guard,” about being 
harassed on the streets, to choreographed Rhythm 
Nation-era Janet Jackson-style dancing.
Hanna tends to shoot herself in the foot when she 
talks — she’s got important things to say, but doesn’t 
generally express herself particularly eloquently. But 
when she backs off with the “um and, um and, you 
know” and starts singing, Le Tigre shines. Their songs 
are always on the edge of too cute, but that’s their 
trademark.
They played some stock favorites (the projected 
video for “Hot Topic” — a song of shout-outs to female 
artists, writers, singers, and leaders — was a series of 
slides of album cover art) but disappointed fans by not 
playing “My Metrocard.”
Despite the button-pushing and knob-turning, the 
music is simple and the message is clear. “FYR,” for 
example, had the crowd yelling along to an acronym 
that makes no sense outside of the context of the song. 
It stands for Fifty Years of Ridicule, which Le Tigre 
forced it into a catchy sing-along about “ten short years 
of progressive change/fifty fucking years of calling us
Their closer was “Keep on Livin’,” an ultra-positive 
song about how vital it is to keep a positive outlook 
when life gets rough — it’s a yell-along anthem, fol­
lowed by a spontaneous cheer by the motiey crew of 
local Radical Cheerleaders in the audience after Le 
Tigre left the stage for good. The show, spastically ener­
getic, lasted less than two hours total — it was over by 
9:15 pm — and left a lot of time to keep on living.

Explaining the World Bank^POLITIK
iHu
Ware the cinr
At the heart of the world’s problems, the poverty found in third world countries throbs like a muffled time 
bomb. And most of us have never seen it.
But according to the provocative posters plastered all over Oakland, we unwittingly support the system of 
checks and imbalances every day. Pittsburgh Organizing Group (POG) says there is someone to blame. The group 
is sponsoring a teach-in about the role of the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 
world poverty on September 1 at 6:30 pm, in the University of Pittsburgh’s Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.
Started a few months ago by a small group composed mostly of University of Pittsburgh students, POG’s main 
project this fall is to educate Pittsburgh’s curious and concerned about the WB and the IMF in time for two large 
rallies against the banks, to be held in Washington, DC, on the weekend of September 27. Speakers at the teach-in 
will include members of POG and representatives from Mobilization for Global Justice and the Anti-Capitalist 
Convergence, two of DC’s leading activist groups.
POG also hopes to sponsor group transportation to the rallies. The group aims to distill the complex economic 
theory into terms of human rights, making the issue more public-friendly, and hopes to promote the teach-in as a 
rare opportunity for Pittsburghers to learn where they fit into the hierarchy of global politics.
“Before, it was only the policy wonks in Washington who were able to read a 400-page (international) loan 
agreement and say, ‘What the hell is going on?’ ” quips Alex Rodley, a founding member of POG. “But if one per­
son explains it to another person, and that person explains it to a whole bunch of people ... the truth will eventu­
ally reach the public.”
In addition to the teach-in on September 1, two organizational meetings for people who intend to accompany 
POG to Washington are being held on September 8 and 22, location to be announced.
Most of the world isn’t well-versed in international finance, and even those who are disagree on what should be 
done in the case of developing nations. Two major schools of economic thought provide opposite solutions to a 
national economic meltdown; either drastically reduce taxes and increase government spending, which alleviates 
financial strain on the population, or do the opposite — slash government spending and raise taxes, which gener­
ates revenue for the government. The World Bank and IMF’s policies fall into the latter category, demanding that 
borrowing nations make payment of their debts top priority.
When a nation can’t make the interest payments or defaults on its loans, it’s time to refinance in order to get a 
better deal. But who’s willing to assume the liability that comes with lending money to a person — or a nation — 
with a history of nonpayment? A desperate nation has to turn to whoever will foot such a tremendous bill — and 
that’s where the World Bank and IMF fit in.
The World Bank, and its sister organization, IMF, are multinational corporations whose original common goal 
was to alleviate the financial imbalances in poverty-stricken countries. POG claims that in the 60 years since they 
were created, the banks’ priorities have shifted toward turning a profit.
The World Bank is just what its name sounds like; a multinational bank owned by 183 countries, large enough 
to finance the world’s home-improvement projects. 26 countries presently receive “debt-relief” funding from the 
Bank. Under the new Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Program, the bank claims, the external debts of these coun­
tries will eventually be reduced by two-thirds. One-fourth of its spending in 2002 funded loans geared toward

...and the International 
Monetary Conspiracy
WE CAN
The International Monetary Fund is a specialized agency of the United Nations, and the central institution of 
the international monetary system — the system of international payments and exchange rates that enables busi­
ness to take place between countries. It also functions as a bank and performs the same lending functions as the 
World Bank. Unlike development banks (like the World Bank), however, the IMF does not lend for specific proj­
ects.
In order to enter into a contract with the World Bank or IMF, a nation must agree to a long list of changes to its 
government and economy, detailing ways in which government spending must be cut. Public hospitals, schools 
and other public services are either privatized or sacrificed altogether in order to meet the “public expenditure 
management” criteria set forth by the Bank — which also tend to include what IMF terms “advice and “technical 
assistance” on tax policy, central banking, payment systems and currency. The end result, says Rodley, is usually 
corporate domination and decreased internal development — which leads to worse poverty.
Clearly, the World Bank and IMF provide some funding to fill urgent needs. But these funds are not being donat­
ed; they are being sold, the same way a credit card company sells individuals money at a higher price. And, just 
like imprudent credit card spending, these loans bring a great deal of pressure to bear on nations not yet devel­
oped enough to cope.

Women at CMU:
Five hundred forty-four Maggie Murphs enrolled at Carnegie Mellon this year, down one from last year’s number, comprising 
just under 40 percent of the incoming class of 2006. Of course, the term “Maggie Murph” is sort of an anachronism, since women 
certainly haven’t been referred to as such since the phasing out of Margaret Morrison Carnegie College (MMCC) in 1969. Some of 
it has been a gradual shift in culture, and some of it has been deliberate and concerted action by or on behalf of University women. 
But since CMU first opened its doors to students in 1905, the roles, perceptions about, and even the attitudes of campus women 
have gone through some remarkable changes.
In 1905, Carnegie Tech admitted its charter class, all 120 of whom were white and male. By May of 1906, the MMCC of Carnegie 
Tech admitted an introductory class of 70 white female students. While the men largely studied engineering and mathematics, 
women were offered such courses as sewing and stenography.
And while science and engineering students are more likely to be male than female, the numbers are slowly balancing out. And 
in the meantime, it seems to be a different sort of woman who attends CMU; knowing in advance that the gender ratio is unbal­
anced in many academic areas is a reason for some to avoid CMU.
It is apparent that the foundation of the University preceded by a great many years any notion of the blurring of the gender bar­
rier. Women and men were prescribed very distinct roles in life, with no room for each other in their respective spheres. And this 
wasn’t disputed by either side to any major extent for many years. In fact, the trustee board for MMCC in 1962, composed of men 
and women, came to a few conclusions that are at worst barbaric and at best uneducated by today’s standards.
“The life pattern of a good many women college graduates in the foreseeable future therefore, will probably be something like 
this:
Age 21-23 work and marriage
Age 24-40 child-rearing
Age 40-55 return to employment
It is obvious from these figures that there are two important prongs to a woman’s education:
professional education — for the period immediately after graduation and for the possible return to employment general educa­
tion — for being a wife, mother, and community mother.”
So it’s not the case that women were ignored at any point in the University’s history, but rather thought of differently. Women 
have always been an integral part of the University, but were thought to have different needs, different ideas, hopes, and dreams. 
In some cases this was reflected in overly controlling policies, however.
There are some fairly (in) famous edicts and regulations which women were expected to follow. Mary Green Watson, a particu­
larly stern Dean of Women, issued two directives to her charges in the 1950s:
1) Girls are not to wear bifurcate garments (slacks, shorts, culottes etc.) on campus and
2) Carnegie Tech women are not to sing the popular song “All of me, why not take all of me?”
In many cases, women were seen as having a need to be looked after and protected. MMCC actually had a milk bar, where under­
weight women were required to buy and consume a glass of milk a day. Women’s dormitories had curfews in place and having male 
visitors was highly scandalous. Even into the 70s there were complaints that guidelines on having opposite sex visitors were 
enforced in women’s dorms but not in men’s.
In some cases one just has to ask, what were they thinking? A 1963 trustee board for MMCC seriously pondered the matter of 
changing the name of the Department of Home Economics to include the word “Science.” Dozens of such names were considered.
1969 was a watershed. Set on a backdrop of counterculture and civil disobedience, the recently renamed “Carnegie-Mellon 
University” began plans to phase out MMCC in favor of a sexually-integrated campus. University archivist Jennie Benford thinks 
that this change may have lead to the events of the early ’70s when a group of women was commissioned to put together a report 
on “The Status and Needs of Women at Carnegie Mellon University.” The formation of the group was ordered by University 
President Guy Stever after several academic women, who eventually formed the Women of Carnegie Mellon (WCM), called his 
attention to discriminatory practices at CMU.
After a detailed investigation, the committee filed their final report on November 1,1971 and detailed some serious failings.
The committee found that women were underrepresented in faculty, administration, and decision-making bodies. Those who did 
have the few available positions were paid less than men for equivalent work. Moreover, the committee found that educational 
opportunities for women were not only poor, but also on the decline.
To this day, a numerical inequality lingers in the University, with women underrepresented in many of the fields CMU is famous 
for, such as engineering and computer science. The numbers were so disproportionate in computer science that in the 1980s, the 
University made a concerted effort to achieve a “critical mass” of women, in the words of Michael Murphy, Dean of Student Affairs, 
to attract more women.

changing roles, 
changing expectations
EATURE
But though the person next to you on the elevator is more likely to be male than female, notions about women 
today are certainly a far cry from the early 20th century, or even the 1970s, at CMU and universities across the 
country. Indira Nair, Vice Provost of Education, reminisced about her experiences after coming to study at Kansas 
State University after she finished her bachelor’s degree in physics at the University of Bombay in 1963.
“A week after I was here, one of my classmates asked me, ‘How did you decide to do physics?’ So I said because 
I liked it. So he asked again, ‘how did you decide to do physics.’ So I was thinking I am not getting it; I said because
I liked it. He said, ‘you’re a woman,’ ” said Nair. “I hadn’t noticed there were no women in physics.”
Now, as a senior administrator of the University, Nair sees differences between men and women, but didn’t 
relate ever having felt discriminated against or hindered by her gender at CMU. She even has a few views that 
might get her into trouble with those not like-minded. She holds that there are several crises in this country, one 
of which is the lack of a caregiver in many families. While she said in no uncertain terms that this job is not every 
woman’s duty, she did say that one learns patience from carrying a child, and that there is a “metamorphosis” a 
woman goes through.
“Trivializing that,” says Nair, “is part of our problem.”
It should be noted that Nair qualified care-giving as to not exclude work or study but for the caregiver to per­
haps have a more flexible schedule to meet the needs of the children.
Today, opportunities exist for women to study engineering at Carnegie Mellon, but preconceived notions 
remain.
“People more expect guys to be engineering and girls to be drama or art majors,” said junior chemistry major 
Amy Van Ollefen. “Most guys are surprised if you tell them you’re science or engineering.”
Women are about half as likely as men to apply to Carnegie Mellon in the first place. Once here, they tend to be 
better students than their male counterparts, having a higher mean QPA (and a lower standard deviation about 
that mean). Women number roughly 40 percent of the student body, and 24 percent of faculty. The women of 
Warner Hall include Indira Nair, vice provost for education, and Kyle Fisher-Morabito, vice president for universi­
ty advancement. All women on campus can wear culottes, slacks, or any other bifurcate garments of their choos­
ing. And most do.

Nothing Isn’t Nothing
Grasp at the shadow and lose the substance. 
This is the moral of Aesop’s fable “The Dog and the 
Shadow.” The dog steals a piece of meat, comes across 
a stream, and sees his reflection in the water. He thinks 
the image is another dog and greedily tries to steal its 
food. Of course the dog drops his food and ends up 
with nothing.
This tale is the inspiration for one of six projects by 
Roger Sayre that will be on exhibit at the Regina 
Gouger Miller Gallery’s third floor starting tomorrow 
as part of WHeeHA7c ilu-ec and 9lobREA CeEto 9lobREAc a 
three-artist show featuring Sayre, Shirin Neshat, and 
Dominique Blain.
Dog biscuits suspended in mid-air cast a shadow por­
trait of the artist’s dog, Crackerjack. However, if the 
hungry creature ever did get his paws on the treats, he 
would disappear — an artistic and creative interpreta­
tion of an ancient moral.
Sayre’s piece “Mirror Chair” is also totally dependent 
on light, as are most of his pieces. Using mirrors and a 
bare light bulb, the artist fools the eye by shaping 
shadow and light. Light bulbs are also incorporated 
into a cityscape — or is it? Sayre entreats visitors to 
look closer.
One side of the third floor will be blocked off to cre­
ate a pitch-black room. As observers feel their way 
around, a bright light will flash every two minutes 
branding their eyes with an eerie image. The artist 
comments in a press release that in this installation 
“Your head becomes a camera,” and it proves that in 
life, “Every moment is different from the next.” Small 
changes in environment become very apparent when 
time is reduced to quick snapshots.
Audience participation is crucial to “Sitting.” Three 
people a day can schedule appointments to have their 
portrait taken with a pinhole camera. Why only three a 
day? “Sitting” requires an hour of sitting almost per­
fectly still, watching yourself in a mirror while the cam­
era captures a “true impression, instead of just a fake 
smile.” In the words of the artist “It’s not about being 
comfortable....”
Roger Sayre has exhibited his work as well as lec­
tured throughout the country and will be giving a talk 
on Wednesday, August 28 at 7:30 PM at Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers on Melwood Avenue. Also lecturing is 
Shirin Neshat on September 19, 6:30pm in Purnell’s 
Chosky Theater.
Neshat’s award-winning films and photos “reflect 
the tensions of Muslim society ... embracing multiple 
points of view that neither condemn nor glorify.” With 
music by Philip Glass, her most recent films encompass 
the themes Possessed, Pulse, and Passage. The latter, 
which embodies death, mourning, and ritual, will be 
playing on the first floor of the Miller Gallery from 
August 27 to October 11.
Works by Dominique Blain exemplifies a history of 
war and turmoil. “Inner Sanctum” is one collection of 
haunting images of children with symbols of civilian 
and military power. Blain will be giving a lecture on her 
work in McConomy on Thursday, August 29 at 5pm. 
Following the presentation will be an opening recep­
tion at the Miller Gallery for the three-artist show.

---------------------------------------------------

Grandiose visions and ideas are nothing new for the Pittsburgh community Oakland. Perhaps it’s because, as 
the workplace for several thousand professors, the most impracticable and ambitious concepts sit in the same 
office as the most useful advances. For example, at Carnegie Mellon the success of the Andrew/IBM network 
grossly overshadows the practically dormant and under-funded digital library. Should it then come as a shock that 
the community’s plans for urban vitality have been comprised mainly of expensive and absurd developments?
That may be the primary message of Designing Oakland, an impressive, but appropriately unwieldy, exhibit at 
the Carnegie Museum of Art. The show documents Oakland’s development from farm expanse to cultural and civic 
center through a tremendous collection of pictures, models, and timepieces. It also imparts on the visitor a keen 
sense of the importance of public feedback in community growth. The exhibit comes at an especially crucial junc­
tion since nearly two dozen different development plans for the neighborhood exist, ranging from the Oakland 
Improvement Strategy’s streetscape initiatives to the University’s master plan. The exhibit does preclude worthy 
criticism of the less than holistic strategies. Little mention is made of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission’s 
Mon-Fayette Expressway — a new highway that dumps onto the already congested Bates Street interchange near 
the Monongahela River in South Oakland.
The 24 differing strategies are a strict departure from historical Oakland building booms. What made Oakland 
such a progressive district was the enormity of the plans for its construction. The exhibit pays immense tribute to 
Francis Nicola’s application of the City Beautiful movement. A late 19th century school of thought, the City 
Beautiful movement advocated the construction of civic centers comprised of museums, libraries, performance 
halls, and other cultural institutions. Based loosely on mass-produced classicism architecture displayed at the 
Chicago’s World Fair in 1894, Oakland displayed central axis planning and rich Beaux-Arts buildings. Needless to 
say, Henry Hornbostel’s Carnegie Technical Schools plan and his equally determined University of Pittsburgh 
acropolis proposal of 1909 were perfect compliments to the Carnegie Museums, Pittsburgh Athletic Association, 
and even Forbes Field. Nicola also remembered to include the ever-crucial residential component, the trim 
Schenley Farms housing plan in North Oakland, an idea that seems to have been forgotten in many modern 
Pittsburgh redevelopment proposals.
Vital to the City Beautiful movement’s success as suggested in the exhibit was private investment. There would 
be no civic playground for the city’s millionaires had people like Andrew Carnegie anted beaucoup dollars. Today’s 
proposals are primarily financed by government and non-profit institutions. No private money will be used for the 
new collaborative Junction Hollow building between CMU and the Carnegie Museums.
A 1960s grandiose scheme, the Panther Hollow research park, lacked the most important aspect of a construc­
tion project: money. Explained through a WTAE-TV pride piece shown at the exhibit, the Panther Hollow research 
park would have been a 150-story skyscraper turned on its side. The building would have complimented other 
imposing University of Pittsburgh cement blocks. If you think the current state of Pitt architecture is sad, be sure 
to check out the scale model of its failed ventures. The research park would have included hanging gardens and a 
subterranean expressway. The period puff piece from the television studio displays the post-modern ignorance of 
pedestrians, in scale and friendliness.
When juxtaposed with the failed research park, the Mon-Fayette Expressway and the planned Junction Hollow 
research building appear suspect at best. Add the University’s defunct CMRI along the Mon River, and the ques­
tions mount as to why the school would invest in office space. Is it only to give companies greater proximity to CMU 
scientists? It’s also worth noting that development of Junction Hollow infringes upon Hornbostel’s original cam­
pus design. The new structure will impede the view of Hamerschlag Hall, which sits elegantly above the latter-day 
Roberts Engineering Hall. Hamerschlag was to be the entrance to the campus, especially for visitors by train. The 
building was also supposed to connect to the Carnegie Museums, a still worthy consideration, albeit unrelated to 
the master plan’s principal tenets. A skybridge would be the iconic connection between CMU and Oakland that the 
University lacks.
But it’s hard to argue that any of Hornbostel’s original ideas remain; consider the infill of medical facilities in his 
Univeristy of Pittsburgh acropolis and the helter-skelter arrangement of post-modern buildings on CMU’s campus. 
Call it organic growth of two vibrant institutions, but yesterday's organic growth only lacked the formality of 
today’s Junction Hollow research building, Carnegie Museum expansion plan, and Oakland blanketing by UPMC. 
The prodigious developments in Oakland, built or dreamt, have great similarities to today’s ambitious fragmented 
proposals. And public input can only force collaboration between so many different and powerful stakeholders.
But criticism of current Oakland initiatives isn’t one of the exhibit’s more refined points. It does a remarkable 
job of contrasting current proposals with the headstrong designs of yesteryear. The exhibit, which appears in the 
Heinz Architectural Center through September 22, also has a fantastic collection of photographs of the working- 
class Oakland, a practically lost element of this college town. Along with several paintings, the photographs add a 
bit of charm to an otherwise very intellectual display. But asking the ivory tower to self-criticize is like asking the 
absent-minded professor to forego an illusion of grandeur.

The Carnegie Museum of Natural History launched a project 65 million years in the making as they began their search 
this July for the top designs of three of the world’s most fantastic prehistoric beasts in DinoMite Days, a new public art 
exhibit which will feature fiberglass sculptures of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Torosaurus, and Stegosaurus. DinoMite Days will 
be a public art exhibit featuring fiberglass casts of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Torosaurus, and Stegosaurus, each will vary in 
dimensions and will be mounted on a 300-pound cement base to prevent them from being moved in the future. The proj­
ect celebrates Pittsburgh’s reputation for scientific innovations and for the superlative dinosaur collection located within 
the museum. The project aims to allow emerging artists as well as professional local artists to get their name out into the 
public’s eye, help support tourism, and promote regional partnerships. Even though each artist must develop a unique 
design to catch the judge’s eye, there are basic web-based templates for that artists must follow, available at 
www.DinoMiteDays.org. Each sketch is judged by a panel of artists and representatives from local art organizations. The 
official winners will receive a $2,500 honorarium, plus $500 in construction costs. Upon completion, the dinosaurs will 
be auctioned and proceeds will be distributed among various cultural organizations.
The deadline for submitting applications and proposals is September 15, 2002.
