CO-ED PUPPET 
OUT JAN. 13
For the first time in a good many 
years the Co-ed Number of the 
Puppet which will be on sale Wed­
nesday, January 13 will be edited 
solely by women members of the 
staff. Mary Hauser has been sit­
ting in the editor’s chair for the 
past few weeks laughing herself to 
death at the many humorous con- 
tribs submitted by the funny-veined 
co-eds of the campus. She is being 
assisted by Zeralda Mazza, Literary 
Editor of the staff. Edna Pearson 
is in charge of the art work with 
Betty Phillips assisting.
Among the features will be the 
“Co-ed’s Diary,” which the co-ed 
staff claims every campus “shiek” 
should read—it’s something like the 
circus tent, it covers everything. 
The men members of the Puppet 
staff are to be taken for the pro­
verbial ride by the co-ed eidtors in 
a feature in which each member is 
pertinentally remarked about—and- 
3rou should see their caricatures. To 
miss the Co-ed Number will be like 
missing .the last train home.

Lithuanian Club
Will Hold Dance
The Lithuanian Intercollegiate 
Club will hold an informal party 
and dance at 142 Orr Street, Soho, 
on Friday evening, January 8, at 
8:00 o’clock. All Lithuanian students 
are invited to attend this gathering 
and to bring their friends.
The regular meeting of the club 
will be held on the following Sun­
day, at 3:00 o’clock, at the Lithuan­
ian Citizens Hall, 1723 Jane Street, 
South Side,
According to reports re­
ceived from the . Mercy Hos­
pital, Dean Tarbell, who was 
injured during the Christmas 
vacation, will be able to re­
turn to school within a week 
to réassumé his duties as 
Dean of Men. He was 
struck by a passing automo­
bile while crossing at the 
corner of Forbes and Beeler 
Streets last Sunday evening. 
The students and faculty of 
Carnegie arc glad to hear 
that Dean Tarbell’s injuries 
are not serious and are look­
ing forward to his return to 
school.
A second unfortunate auto­
mobile ifccident that occur­
red during the holiday vaca­
tion caused the injury of two 
Carnegie Tech students, Carl­
ton Pearch and Thomas 
Waldron, the former having 
his leg crushed to an extent 
that necessitated its amputa­
tion just below the knee. The 
accident occurred near Titus­
ville and it is believed that 
carbon monoxide fumes were 
the cause as no collision took 
place. Waldron who suffered 
only a few bruises, will soon 
be back in school. To Pearch, 
who is now in a Titusville 
hospital, the Carnegie Tartan 
and students of Carnegie send 
their mutual condolences.
DR. MAX SCHOEN 
COMPLETES BOOK
“Art and Beauty” is First 
Book on Aesthetics
Dr. Max Schocn, head of the De­
partment of Education and Psy­
chology, has just completed a book 
on aesthetics, the title of which- is 
“Art and Beauty:” This book will 
be published sometime in April, 1932, 
by the Macmillan Company- of New 
York City.
The book consists of material 
which is offered by Dr. Schocn’s 
course on aesthetics here at Car­
negie. It opens with an introductory 
chapter which discusses the nature, 
objective, and material of aesthetics. 
Dr. Schocn establishes the point of 
view that aesthetics is an inquiry into 
the nature of the experience of 
beauty and the nature of the 
aesthetic, creative activity. Besides 
this interesting definition of aesthe­
tics, Part I is dcvot.d to a study of 
the significance of the art work from 
the standpoint of l;hc crcator. Chap­
ter II is an inquiry into the nature 
and meaning of the art work as a 
whole, with the conclusion that it is 
“a unique rccord of a unique ex­
perience of a unique mind.” Chapter 
III supplements this general defini­
tion by an analysis of the creative 
activity of the creative mind, tracing 
the activity step by step from its 
conception to its culmination in the 
finished product, while Chapter IV 
discusscs i the mental and tempera­
mental characteristics of crcative^gcn- 
ius. Chapter V summarizes Dr. 
Schoen’s conclusions, and points out 
some misconceptions about art and 
artistic activit}'.
Part II deals with art from the 
standpoint of the layman. Chapter VI, 
opening the second part, is an ex­
amination of the nature of the ex­
perience of beautjr. A conclusion is 
reached regarding the function of 
art, and what human need it fills. 
The concluding chapters examine this 
definition in the light of the fine 
arts; music, painting, and poctrj'.
ORCHESTRA FOR SOPH HOP
AUSTIN WYLIE’S BAND.
PROM BAND TO 
BE NAMED SOON
Student Ballot Shows Cum­
mins, O’Hare and Tremain 
Most Popular
Arrangements for the Men’s Jun­
ior Prom are nearing completion 
according to John L. Ivronenberg, 
chairman of the committee. The 
one major problem still confronting 
the members of the Prom commit­
tee is the final selection of an or­
chestra. The recent ballot at the 
Delta Skull Tea Dance has given 
the necessary idea of student opin­
ion and an orchestra will- be signed 
in the near future.
In the balloting some eighteen 
different orchestras were accorded 
support although some of these 
were mentioned only slightly. When 
the first, second and third choices 
had been tabulated on a three, two 
one basis the leader was found to 
be Bernic Cummins and his Hotel 
New Yorker Orchestra followed by 
Husk O’Harc and Paul Tremaine.
Cummins will be remembered as 
the orchestra that opened the New 
Yorker several years ago. He is a 
popular orchestra for college func­
tions and will be the first band to 
broadcast on the New Lucky Strike 
scries which is to feature bands 
direct from the bigger college 
proms. . He will inaugurate this 
scries playing from the fancy dress 
ball at Washington Lee, the 28th 
of this month. Cummins has ap­
peared in Pittsburgh at the Wil­
lows several summers ago as a 
unit of the National Broadcasting 
system group of which lie and Rudy 
Vallec were the featured bands.
Husk O’Hare needs no introduc­
tion in this part of the country 
after playing the Intercollegiate ball 
Christmas night. His orchestra was 
the hit of the dance and won much 
praise not only from those in at­
tendance but also from those who 
heard it on the air. A very popu­
lar orchestra in the middle west, 
this was one of his first trips east 
and indeed proved a success.
Paul Tremaine is probably'best 
known for his long stay at Younge’s 
Restaurant in New York. During 
his stay there he broadcast a daily

Work of Tartan Reporter Causes
Mental Anguish and Fallen Arches
Many Weary Hours Spent 
Following Noses For 
News
The average Tartan reader never 
ponders upon the trials and tribu­
lations through which a reporter 
must pass to secure the precious 
news of our college paper. Every 
little article on this page requires 
several personal interviews, a num­
ber of phone calls, several miles 
of. hiking about the campus, two 
or three hours of valuable time 
for composing and writing t h c 
story, and finally another inter­
view for the purpose of getting 
the story approved by some au­
thority.
The mere mention of the fact 
that this work is similar to writ­
ing freshman English themes is 
sufficient to arouse the sympathy 
of our readers. But it is occasion­
ally more painful because owing to 
the lack of space, an article which 
necessitated hours of sacrificed ef­
fort and toil frequently cannot be 
published. Yes, dear readers, the 
discouragements are many and the 
inspirations fewl
Two little incidents will suffice 
in illustrating the disheartening ex­
periences a Tartan reporter en­
counters weekly.
A conscientious news hunter re­
ported to the editor that he had 
an excellent story in mind but 
just did not know how to write 
it up. The story pertained to an 
accidental fire and near-explosion, 
which occurred in the research 
laboratory of the Chemistry de­
partment last December. It seems 
that the reporter hesitated in writ­
ing it as a straight news story 
for fear of becoming unpopular 
with' the students involved, know­
ing full well that the least said 
about such subjects the better.
But this was not all that vexed 
the troubled reporter. He reveal­
ed, to the editor that he had un­
covered information concerning the 
degenerated condition of the fire­
fighting apparatus, which would 
make a first class censorious edi­
torial of the Pittsburgh newspaper 
type. He had discovered that the 
hose which was frantically snatch­
ed arid hopefully directed at the 
flames issued water from every 
point except the nozzle, and that

Women’s Scholarship Club 
Features Performance
Angna Enters, well known danccr 
and mimist, will be the entertainer 
at the annual presentation of the 
Women's Scholarship Organization 
this year. The performance will be 
given at the Carnegie Music Hall on 
the evening of February 29.
The danccr, Miss Enters, has been 
chosen by the organization because 
of her success in several large cities. 
This will be her first appearance in 
Pittsburgh, and it is believed that 
this performance will arouse great 
enthusiasm, especially among those 
who have followed her throughout 
her _ interesting career.
The Women’s Scholarship Organ­
ization, headed this year by Ruth 
Brooks, is a charitable association 
composed of the • presidents of all 
the women’s groups on the campus 
and of representatives of women’s 
official activities. The purpose of 
the organization is to award scholar­
ships to deserving candidates in Mar­
garet Morrison and Art School. Each 
year the organization gives a theatri­
cal benefit to provid^ money for these 
scholarships. Last y'ear the associa­
tion was able, by means of a theater 
party, to give ten scholarships of one 
hundred dollars each to needy girls.
New Decorations Brighten
M. M. Smoking Room
The Margaret Morrison smoking 
room has been redecorated by 
means of funds contributed by the 
Margaret Morrison Senate and the 
four classes. Each class gave 
five dollars and the Senate gave 
ten. During the Christmas vaca­
tion new cushions, draperies, smok­
ing stands and a rug were pur­
chased. Zarclda Mazza and Kay 
Wholey made the drapes; Dean 
Green and Lois McGregor selected 
the new furnishings. The chairs 
and the table were repainted red.
The girls should do their best 
to keep the room looking as at­
tractive as possible.

GRADUATES WORK 
FOR D.Sc. DEGREES
Advanced Students Study 
Technical Problems in 
Research
With the installation and growth 
of new scientific laboratories at Car­
negie and a yearly increase of re­
search staffs, Carnegie is becoming 
more and more prominent as a con­
tributor to scientific knowledge. A 
corps, of graduate students and sev­
eral pcrmarient . staffs are now in­
vestigating numerous problems in 
nearly every branch of engineering 
and several of the sciences.
For the current year there is a 
total of thirty-three graduate stu­
dents enrolled at Carnegie, each of 
whom is investigating a dissertation 
problem in some branch of scicnce. 
Included among these are two candi­
dates for a Doctor of, Scicnce de­
gree, two candidates for a Master 
of Architecture degree, 22 candidates 
for a Master, of Science degree, and 
seven Bureau of Mines Fellows, who 
also are working towards their M. S. 
degrees.
The two candidates for the D. Sc. 
degree arc Cyril Wells, assistant 
metallurgist of the Bureau of Metal­
lurgical Research, and John F. 
Eckels, research assistant of the 
same bureau. Both were given their 
M. S. Degrees from Carnegie and 
have selected the influence of car­
bon on iron-manganesc alloys as their 
thesis topics.
The two candidates for the Mas­
ter of Architecture degree arc Paul 
K. Schell and Sebastian J. Fauriello, 
both graduates of Carnegie Tech.
From the following list of gradu­
ate students and their dissertation 
topics, a supplement to that publish­
ed in the last issue, an insight may 
be obtained of the broad scope of 
the research work at Carnegie.
Wm. D. Aranyos, a Notre Dame 
graduate, is investigating “A Study 
of Very Low Carbon Chromium 
Nickel Alloys.”
John Boyd, Carnegie graduate,
“Flow in Certain Types of Chan­
nels.”
Homer O. Dahlke, Washington 
State College, “A Study of Cor­
rosion Resistance Properties and 
Metallographic Structure of Cor­
rosion 1 Resistant Steels as Produced 
by the Navy Yard.”

AUSTIN WYLIE TO PLAY 
FOR SOPH HOP FRIDAY
Complete Thistle Hall For Soph
Hop; Set Opening For January 8
Soph Class Dance is Initial For New Gymnasium; 
Wocdlawn Avenue Entrance to Lead 
to Modernistic Hall
Thistle Hall, or the New Union, 
as it was formerly known, is well 
on its way to completion and will 
have its formal opening on the 
night of the Soph Hop, Friday, 
January 8. Although the suite 
lacks a few finishing touches, the 
furniture, .. drapery and color 
schemes have been planned and 
arranged, and, according to H. C. 
Brockman, '23, the architect, all 
will be ready for the first social 
event to be held within its walls.
The history of Thistle Hall is 
brief but unusual. The idea origi­
nated when the necessity arose for 
more handball courts. For this 
purpose the room over the swim­
ming pool was suggested. After 
some consideration, however, the 
idea of handball courts was dis­
carded, for the whole large room 
would serve more people, such as 
members of eurythmics classes and 
musical organizations, if it were 
not used to accommodate the 
courts. Gradually out of the haze 
of ideas grew the reality of the 
New Union, as represented by the 
work of Mr. Brockman, an alum­
nus, now in the office of Mr. 
Hornbostel, school architect. En­
trance to Thistle Hall is gained 
by means of the steps which lead 
from Woodlawn Avenue, beside 
Skibo Inn, back of the gymnasium, 
to the main door of the hall.
The entire suite consists of an 
entrance lounge, or foyer; the hall 
itself; a checking room; a small 
lounge just off of the dance floor; 
and a women’s lounge, informally 
known as the “powder room,” up­
stairs. Downstairs are found a 
small room containing benches and 
seats, where light refreshments will 
be sold, and a large smoking 
lounge.
Taking the rooms in order, Mr. 
Brockman asserts that the foyer is 
to be painted in terra-cotta and 
ivory. Metal furniture will be fea­
tured, while the windows are to be 
hung with casement cloth.
An individual checking room is 
a much-needed feature of the suite, 
insuring greater convenience to the 
guests.
Green and henna are to be the

Twelve-Piece Orchestra is 
Engaged For Thistle

LOWER ADMISSION PRICE
Pittsburgh Radio Station 
to Schedule Half-Hour 
Broadcast
Austin Wylie’s 12-piccc Brunswick 
Recording orchestra has been se­
cured to play at the Soph Hop, to 
be held Frida3r, January 8, from 9 
till 1 o’clock, in Thistle Hall. This 
orchestra is one of the finest trav­
eling organizations' in the eastern 
United States. It has appeared at 
numerous college affairs, amonff 
them Penn State’s Senior Ball and 
Pitt’s Soph Hop last year. It will 
also play for P. C. W.’s Junior 
Hop this spring. Austin Wylic’3 
is one of the pioneer radio broad­
casting bands, having played for 
both National and Columbia Broad­
casting Systems during the last 
eight years. It broadcasts rcgiH 
larly over station WTAM in Cleve­
land, where it is one of the most 
popular dance orchestras. In Pitts­
burgh, Austin Wylie has played at 
the Nixon Restaurant and at the 
Willows. His orchestra was last 
heard here on Christmas night at 
the Anatole Club ball, held in the 
Fort Pitt Hotel.
A new and unusual feature of 
the Soph Plop is that from 9:30 
until 10 o’clock it will be broad­
cast over station WWSW. This 
is also the first dancc to be held 
in the new Carnegie Union, Thistle 
Hall. Another attractive feature of 
the dancc is its lowered price, 
which is $2.75. This is the lowest 
possible price at which. the dance, 
can be a financial success. The 
Soph Hop is usually one of the 
largest dances held on the Campus* 
and in view of the splendid or­
chestra and the reasonable admis­
sion price, the committee in charge 
of the dancc is expecting a large 
crowd this year. The Sopliomoro 
Class cordially invites the entire 
student _ body, freshmen, upper 
classmen, night students, and the 
alumni.
Chaperons for the dancc are Mr. 
and Mrs. R. V. Davis, Mr. and 
Mrs. E. S. Parker, Major and Mrs. 
C. B. Stanton, Dr. and Mrs. J. H. 
Nccllcy, Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Morc-

PAGE TWO'THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1932:
TARTAN SPORTS PAGE
CRANEGIE’S BASKETBALL REPRESENTATIVES re­
turned from a playful holiday with a clear conscience and a 
bottle full of certified hope for winning just about all of the 
remaining games on their schedule. Thé performances to date 
show four wins with half as many losses. Their crowning 
achievement was the 40 to 30 victory over Chicago University 
in an overtime battle last Saturday night.
The Chicago struggle followed the lines of one of those 
games that you “read about,” where the trailing team over­
comes a twelve-point lead in the last five and one-half minutes 
of play. A Scotch ending was attached to the story via two 
field goals in the extra period of play.
It is interesting to note that this is the first game in which 
the Tartans were outscored in field goals, or a better conclusion 
is found in the fact that the game was won by the free throws. 
This is a definite contrast with their first appearance where the 
foul shooting was about 34 per cent efficient. During the six 
games their efforts have improved 100 per cent in this respect.* * 3fï * . *
COACH HOGAN’S TOSSERS are credited with the most 
overwhelming defeat over the Buffalo Bulls within the last 
decade. Ed Stentz helped Bob Smith to win the, game by keep­
ing a close tab on Eddie Malanowicz who could have collected 
many more points for the Bulls had he not been guarded so 
closely.
The Yale aggregation showed the wear and tear of their 
trip and were consequently unable to put up the opposition that 
was expected. In this game, Lou Jagnow lead the scoring with 
15 .points which were garnered ih his own sensational manner. h< * * * *
W. & J.’S COURTMEN ARE EXPECTED to provide some 
lively competition in the gym on Wednesday evening, both in 
the varsity and freshmen classes. The Red and Black quintet, 
which is fresh out of the box, possesses all those expectations 
of uncorking a successful season. This fact, together with the 
traditional jinx idea seems to be the only points in favor of the 
Presidents.
A typical Thiel floor squad will show their wares against 
the varsity on Saturday night. A Plaid victory is expected, 
while the Plebes are very likely to find their hands full with 
the Johnstown Junior College. Both preliminary games this 
week will get under way at seven fiifteen, the regular athletic book being used for admittance.* * * * *
CARNEGIE'S BOXERS have enjoyed' a rather fruitful
holiday according to Coach Ernie Scsto who Has been working 
out with most of his squad in Pittsburgh. The gloved athletes 
are looking forward to their opening match here a week from 
Saturday with West Virginia.
Jeff Burke added another scalp to his belt recently by a 
second-round knockout in a Cleveland exhibition bout.* * + + *
INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL will comc to life next 
AConday night when the various orders rise in defense of their 
court rights. A meeting of team representatives will be held 
in the Trophy Room today nt 4:30, Lots will be drawn for places in the competition.« * * * *
CARNEGIE’S WRESTLING MATERIAL will go in for
a bit of action this week in preparation for the intramural 
competition which will be run in February,
Mr. Rintelin will meet nil candidates for the first workout ¦Thursday in the Gym.
WOMEN’S ATHLETICS
Bnakotbnll 
All the girls in Arts School and 
Margaret Morrison arc urged , lo 
start coining out for the basketball 
parctices immediately if they have 
any desire to make the teams. 
Girls chosen for the different class 
teams arc required to have an aver­
age of two practices a week to 
their credit. Points arc given for 
making the teams and also for tak­
ing activo part in a certain number 
of practiccs.
Marion McNary, this year's bas­
ketball, manager, has posted on the 
Athletic Bulletin Board in Margaret 
Morrison the schedule of practices 
for each class. It is hoped that the 
scheduling of practices by classes 
will relieve the congestion at the 
afternoon practiccs and give each girl a fairer chance to demonstrate 
her ability to play. Start coming 
out now.
Rifle
Intercollegiate telegraphic matches 
will start the end of this month 
with George Washington Univer­
sity, Penn State, University of 
Iowa, Northwestern University, and 
other colleges and universities lo­
cated in all sections of the United 
Stales as well as in Hawaii. A 
telegraphic match will also be held 
with the Women’s Rifle Team of 
the University of Pittsburgh. This 
is Pitt’s first year to indulge in 
such a female sport. An unofficial 
shouldcr-to-shouider meet is also 
being arranged to further the 
sportsmanlike feeling between the 
women of the two institutions. The 
motto, “Play for play’s pake,’’ 
which is being fostered by all mem­
bers of the A. C. A. C. W., is the 
underlying principle of the meets 
between the women of Carnegie and Pitt.
Since there are approximately 
seven girls of last year's team, Car­
negie should be able ,to make a 
better showing in the National 
Rifle Association Match which is 
shot in three Stages during the 
rifle season. Several of the begin­
ners are showing promise of being 
good shooters. They will compete 
for places in the first ten of the 
varsity team with the members of 
last year’s team who are still in 
school. Steadiness, Persistency, and 
great care are necessary qualities 
of a good marksman. Comc on 
girls, let’s make this year the best 
that the Carnegie' Tech Women's 
Rifle Team has known.
PLEBE TOSSERS 
TO PLAY TWO
As far as priming goes, the X’lebe 
basketball squad is well fixed for 
their first crack at the freshmen 
circles of intercollegiate floor conv 
petition. Their official season opens 
Wednesday night at; 7:15 with the 
W. & Frosh as a preliminary to 
the varsity game in the gym. In 
the same role, the Plebes will 
tackle the Johnstown Junior Col­
lege crew on Saturday at 7:15. The 
Carnegie yearlings have a fair com­
bination, but the outcome of any 
game is in doubt. This is often 
due to the inconsistent playing of 
the first year men.
The Plebes showed up well, in 
their decisive win over McDonald 
High, 36 to 17. With a little pol 
ishing of the offense and more ac­
curate shooting, Coach Ncasc's men 
could make a creditable standing 
against any team.
The freshman squad includes 
Ewalt, Carlson, and Roos, forwards; 
Rigg, McCalmon, Mihm, and Stitt, 
guards; McLanahan, center.

PLAID COURTMEN 
DEFEAT BUFFALO
Smith and Jagnow Lead 
Skibos in Close 
Games
Last Friday night the Tartan 
baskctccrs gained a 49-30 victory 
over Buffalo University, thus aveng­
ing the defeat they suffered at the 
hands of the Bisons last season.
"Bob” Smith went wild against the 
Bulls, scoring 21 points as his con­
tribution to the Plaid total for the 
evening. He scored eight baskets and 
five free throws to amass as .many 
points during the evening as he had 
gathered during the first four con­
tests of the season. His dead eye 
oil the short ones was the big reason 
the Carnegie lead was so husky.
Buffalo opened fast, running up a 
10-3 count and holding the Skibos 
without a field goal until midway 
in the first half. At this point, how­
ever, the Carnegie team took things 
in hand and ran the score to 17-14 
in their favor before the half ended.
Accurate passing, shooting, and 
flawless floor work at the opening of 
the second stanza forced the Bisons 
to assume the defensivt, and as the 
Skibo lead continued to mount three 
Buffalo players went out on personal 
fouls as they, strove desperately to 
stop the avalanche of points.
Defeat Chicago
The ever fighting Carnegie Tech 
basketball team handed the Chicago 
University five the short end of a 
40-39 score last Saturday in an 
overtime contest after trailing by 
twelve points midway in the second 
half.
Bob” Smith was the hero of the 
struggle, saving the game for the 
Plaid by sinking two baskets in the 
closing minutes of play to knot the 
count at .the close of regulation 
playing time 36-36.
At the start of the overtime per­
iod Parsons sunk a free throw to 
set Chicago ahead oncc more, but 
the Maroons lead was short lived, 
for Jagnow angled a two-pointer 
from a difficult position only a 
second later. Silverman brought 
the Skibo total to 39 and Jagnow 
ended the scoring for the Plaid, 
also sinking a charity shoot. Steph­
enson sunk a basket just as the 
whistle blew; giving Carnegie her 
third consecutive victory 40-39.
Skibos Start Slow
Gettjng of to a slow start the 
Skibos found themselves trailing at 
the end of the half 15-12. After 
holding their own for the opening 
minutes of the second stanza the 
Plaid five seemed to wilt before 
their Big Ten opponents, and at the 
middle of the sccond half they were 
trailing 28-16.
At this point however the Carnegie 
offense began to click, and in the 
remaining minutes of play the Plaid 
quint gained enough ground to tic 
the count at 36 all.
Close guarding by Fergus and 
Leonard hold Stephausou and Porter, 
the Maroon's highly tooted forwards, 
at bay, and checked several of the 
Windy City lads’ rally».
A crowd of close to five thousand 
spectators witnessed the struggle 
which was the sccond lo be held in 
the mammoth field house just com­
pleted.

WORK OF TARTAN
(Continued from Page One) 
most of those fire , extinguishers 
that could be found were of an 
antique pump type, which required 
four hands to operate.
Of coursc. the publication of 
such an' editorial would put the 
Tartan on extremely ragged terms 
with Mr. Orbin and his associates. 
“Well, you needn’t write anything 
about it,” the editor told the re­
porter. And he didn't.
Then there is the story of the 
reporter who recently walked into 
the office of a famous personage 
(no names divulged) in the Col­
lege of Industries in search of 
news. He was of the opinion that 
lie might incidentally acquire 
enough news for a short story, al­
though lie went primarily for the 
purpose of requesting the person 
mentioned to contribute a few 
philosophical articles for the Car- 
negicTartan. lie did make the re­
quest, and immediately found his 
face next to a little red card tack­
ed on the desk. It was entitled 
"A Prayer For Today” (which, in­
cidentally, is copyrighted), and it 
read as follows:
“Oh, Lord, help me to keep my 
damn nose out of other people’s 
business. Amen.”

War is Hell
"Comrades of 1918,” the German 
production, coming soon to the 
Cinema is a mighty accusation 
against war madness. The youth of 
the world, who see only the glamour 
of a uniform, and not what lies be­
hind it, should see this film, and 
German officials arc already taking 
steps to have this war , drama shown 
at the first of each year or when­
ever danger menaces, to give Ger­
man -itizens a strong reminder of 
the horrors of war.
"Comrades of 1918” is a powerful 
appeal to the human heart and to 
human reason.
“The. Nation,” in its sixth annual 
survey, has presented a tentative 
list of Americans who have dis­
tinguished themselves during the past 
year in public service, journalism, 
and in the arts and sciences.
In public service, four groups arc 
given mention for their activities: 
The Wickcrsham Commission, the 
Women's International League for 
Peace and Freedom, the Southern 
Commission for the Study of Lynch­
ing, and a number of men who arc 
seeking' to free Mooney from a 
prison in California.
Others honor-cd are the two La 
Follcttcs of Wisconsin for their ef­
forts in the economic crisis, Penn­
sylvania Supreme Court Justice 
George W. Maxey for his dissent­
ing opinion in a case involving free 
speech for labor organizers, and Alan- 
son B. Houghton for his statesman­
like policies of peace.
In'journalism the Buffalo Evening 
News is complemented for its work 
in improving working and housing 
conditions of laborers on state pub­
lic works. Ii. L. Mencken is men­
tioned for his polemic denouncing 
Salisbury lynchings in the face of 
threats of Salisbury business men of 
withdrawing their business from 
Baltimore. Louis F. Stark’s articles 
in the New York Times on the piti­
ful living conditions among Ken­
tucky miners was given notice.,.
The following books or plays have 
given their authors a place on the 
roll of merit: “Mourning becomes 
Electra” by Eugene O’Neill, “Brief 
Moment” by N. S. Behrman, "A 
Calendar of Sin” by Evelyn Scott, 
“Reason and Nature” by -Morris R. 
Cohen, and “Living My Life,” by 
Emma Goldman. Alla Nazimova and 
Alice Brady are mentioned for their 
impressive work in the O’Neill 
tragedy.
In art and architecture the honor 
roll includes the artists .and anthro­
pologists who assembled and present­
ed to the public the Exposition of 
Indian Tribal Arts in New York 
City, the designers and builders of 
the George Washington .Memorial 
Bridge, O. H. Amann for his suspen­
sion bridge in New York City, and 
Otto Soglow for his “Pretty Pic­
tures” and his Little King in the 
:Ncw Yorker.”
The late Mrs. Harriet Lanier, 
patron of the Friends of Music, and 
Arthur Bodansky, its director, have 
been mentioned lor fine musical per­
formances given in New York dur­
ing the last ten years.

COMPLETE THISTLE HALL
(Continued from Page One) 
colors of the hall itself, which is 
larger than the Old Union. There 
are to be no chairs around the 
edges of the room, leaving more 
space for dancing. The walls and 
ceiling of the room are to be of 
an ivory color, while the window 
draperies will be of heavy green 
silk material. Later, the steel 
beams will be cut in the same 
modernistic design as the door be­
tween the foyer and the dance hall. 
The ceiling will be treated with 
colored lights. Some acoustic ma­
terial is to be placed between the 
beams and the ceiling, to remedy 
the imperfect acoustics now exist­
ing. The dancc floor will provide 
space for about three hundred cou­
ples, according to Mr. Brockman, 
who, .incidentally,- was responsible 
for remodeling Carnegie Inn.
Downstairs, below^the foyer, is 
a small, cleverly decorated room 
known as the “ratskeller,” where 
soft drinks, ice cream and other 
light refreshments can be purchas­
ed. The colors used in decorating 
this room will be black and terra­
cotta, with the service portion, be­
hind the counter, in black and 
white. The-lighting is to be dim, 
except behind the .counter, where 
it will be very bright.
Probably the most interesting 
room in the entire suite is - the 
smoking lounge, or club room, lo­
cated near the “ratskeller.” This 
room contains modernistic furni­
ture of maple and dull red leather. 
Bare wooden walls, high windows, 
,and .old wall lamps suggest a ship’s 
cabin, but are, at the same time, 
in accordance with the furniture.

plete the color combination in this 
room. The furniture in the lounge

Keep a Regular
TELEPHONEDate with Home
Frirda yNr ghtS proved beyond 
lUHtl a doubt! More and more tele- 
-phone calls from campus to 
home are being made each month.
The reason’s not hard to find!
Try it yourself, just once! Call up Mother and 
Dad. You’ll not forget the thrill of hearing 
their voices ... nor their joy in hearing from 
you in person. Small wonder if you come 
back for more . . . regularly, each week!
“Voice visits” with home, you’ll soon discover, 
are next best to being there. They cost so 
little and give so much. That’s the reason for 
their popularity.
FOR THE LOWEST COST 
AND GREATEST EASE
Set your “date” for after 8.30 P. M., and take ad­
vantage of the low Night Rates. (A dollar call is 
60c at night; a 50c call is 35c.)
By making a date, the folks will be at home. Thus 
you can make a Station to Station call rather than a more expensive Person to Person call.
Just give the operator your home telephone num-, bcr. If you like, charges can be reversed.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1932.THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE.
A SECTION OF THE TARTAN DEVOTED TO THE NIGHT STUDENTS.
MeJtajhts
Well, here we are, back again, 
after that wild jamboree of a wet 
time for the past eighteen day: 
rather nights—because we are listed 
as night students—so that’s that. 
Anyway, it was a wet time—no, I 
don't mean the way you are think­
ing. Pluvious certainly did deluge 
us with a lot of "wet weather1' 
hereabputs for the holiday season. 
Never saw it rain so much in my 
life. And to think just when a 
fellow wanted it dry. We don’t 
seem to get what we want these 
days. I was all set for a big time 
in the old town after all my hard 
work dodging assignments and 
whatnot for the past three months 
and it had to be spoiled by that 
“wet weather.” What’s a poor idle 
night, student going to do?
* * * * *
Resolutions arc in order now 
and I suppose the rest of us are 
back — excluding me—all primed 
full of resolutions made during the 
fortnight when spirits ran high and 
one’s pocketbook ran low. Seems 
that these resolutions arc made 
with the sole intention of seeing 
how often and how soon they can 
be broken. No, I didn’t make any. 
I just started in' \vhere I left off 
with the intention of trying to 
be more idle, if possible, than I 
was before, which is saying a good 
deal.
*****
I suppose you started the New 
Year off with the right foot down, 
all set to conquer old man depres­
sion. More power to you. Hope 
you succeed. Nothing- is wanted 
more these nights when the winds 
howl along the balmy place known 
as the "Cut.” The crowds don’t 
seem as big as previous years. The. 
depression certainly has dug into 
our ranks. I used to marvel at the 
large. number of night students, 
night after night, week in and 
week out, who gave their evenings 
over to study and preparation for 
something better and wondered if 
I ^^uld,^vr'.be so fortunate as to 
become aw serious as some of them. 
But , then, psychologists tell us that 
human beings are different and that 
they have different tendencies, etc., 
so I must be different. At all 
events, my hat’s off to those night 
students who accomplish something 
by going to Carnegie Tech at 
night.
I am wondering how the long 
distance contest as to the amount 
of miles traveled during the week 
is coming along since vacation. 
There should be some marathon 
sprinters developed during the 
period of the contest. I see that 
Red Onion has made a claim for 
the honors. Well, onions do have 
a claim for distinction in some 
regard especially when you have a 
big date on and you arc particu­

During the fast-fleeting holidays 
I took a walk over to the campus 
and certainly didn’t recognize the 
place where only two weeks ago 
their was so much life. It doesn't 
take long to scatter people. No, I 
didn’t even see our good friend, 
Mr. Mansen, he who is always 
around; but then, it was early in 
the afternoon, and I suppose that 
it is too much to expect that he
would be required to be there at
that time. At all events, the vaca­
tions are over, and I’ll have to
get down to more hard work of
dodging all I can. Yes, I succeed 
sometimes.

CONTEST FOR NIGHT 
CHAMPION RAGES ON
Entrants Bring Out Interest­
ing Facts Claiming 
Right to Title
The contest being held by the 
Plaid to find Carnegie’s long distance 
traveling night student is getting 
hotter than the place where satan 
holds sway. Letters have been pour­
ing in from all directions around 
this great metropolis of our. The 
facts brought out concerning our 
commuting night students are very 
intcresting and they have already 
shattered the record set by that 
western student. In fact, his rec­
ord looks like child's play compared 
to what some of our travellers are doing.
bellow citizens, the sacrifices be­
ing made by these students are the 
marvels of our civilization. Night 
after night, week after"week, thru 
rain and snow, thru the bitter cold 
and biting winds of the worst sea­
sons of the year, these men and 
women are seeking an education to 
better their place in life and by- the 
enormous sacrifices they make, they 
arc proving that this country of 
ours is made of stern, courageous 
stuff. The spirit of our fighting
forefathers still lives in their noble 
hearts and the will to cpnquer
readies greater heights than ever 
before. Success will be theirs, must 
be theirs, they will not be denied. 
Among them is one, by virtue of 
the great sacrifices made by him, 
who best exemplifies the spirit of 
our night school and to whom the 
toga of Carnegie's Champion long 
distance travelling night student be­
longs, will you, Mr. ----------- step
forward.
Hark, you commuting students, 
whose name is going to fill in the 
blank in Senator Ballyhoo’s speech 
before the Wichersham Committee. 
Maybe it will be yours, maybe your 
friend’s, let's hear from you, just 
address your letter to the News 
Editor of the Plaid, stating the 
number of miles travelled each eve­
ning, and the total number travel­
led per week together with the 
evenings spent in the portals of 
Carnegie seeking that will-o-thc- 
whisp called knowledge. The con­
test will soon be over so that the 
committee can get down to business 
and announce, the winners of this 
unique contest. Hurry up, while 
there is time—you, yes, you may 
be the man we are looking' for.
S,
WORLD DEPOPULATION
Some people think that there arc 
ioo ihany human beings in the 
world, while others think, as Pro­
fessor J. S. Huxley of King’s Col­
lege, London, that a deficit will ex­
ist within the next hundred years. 
Huxley claims that deliberate birth 
control, postponement of' marriage, 
and the ever increasing number who 
remain unmarried arc factors which 
will tend to cause this deficit. Hux­
ley has been strengthened in his 
studies by those of Professor Iiog- 
hen, a well known English biologist. 
They have been studying different 
fertility of individuals, classes, and 
nations with the purpose in view 
of improving the average quality of 
human beings.
To the laymen, such studies seem 
to be unprofitable but the reputa­
tion of these two men serves to 
strengthen their argument as they 
are fully competent to undertake 
such studies. They believe that in 
the future there will be necessary 
extensive changes in family eco­
nomics and social organization in 
order to insure against gradual ex­
tinction of human beings. C.
Women students at the UNI­
VERSITY OF MISSOURI have 
resolved to make their spring 
wardrobes entirely of cotton, in 
order to help conditions in the 
cotton industry.

NEWS AND VIEWS
The Christmas Holidays arc over 
now, and the sinister presence of old 
man examination will be more ob­
vious from now on, but let us get 
some choice bits of news ,off our
chest, it seems ages since the last
issue of the Plaid.
Highway men have now entered 
the sacrcd grounds of Carnegie. Two
night students r\vcrc held up and
robbed as they' approachcd their 
parked car a few feet from Admin­
istration Hall. We demand bctfcr 
police protection, and fewer yellow 
horses. The city is reaping a harvest 
from unfortunate night students who, 
in despair, find it necessary to vio­
late parking laws in order to attend 
classes on time. .
Night students taking English under 
Professor Kirk Patrick who submit­
ted essays on the “Meaning of the 
Christmas Spirit" received many 
favorable comments in Pittsburgh 
newspapers recently. Several lines 
were quoted from the best of them.
Atta Boy, - write for the glory of
Carnegie.
Night engineers suddenlj’ develop 
art appreciation. One can often see 
them crowded around a tiny crack 
in the door of a life class (watch­
ing students at work). Oh yes?
Many people must have felt 
swindled when newspapers announced 
that the coach on Christmas seals 
had been drawn wrong, to think
that the}' weren’t getting the real
thing. They say that the driver’s scat 
was on the wrong side. Oh well, 
don't feel so badly about it, artistic 
reasons, perhaps.
The pseudo intellige'ncia have found 
a new way to get into print. They 
disprove” Dr. Callahan’s angle tri­
section theory through local news­
paper columns. Who knows, we may 
have some new Einsteins in the 
rfiaking.
The annual dinner dance of Nu 
Sigma Alpha was certainly a color­
ful affair at the Pcnn-Lincoln Hotel 
on December 26. A big Christmas 
tree in the Ball Room , kept remind­
ing the dancers of the spirit of the 
occasion.
Tell me what- you laugh at and 
I’ll tell you your mental age,”—wc’rc 
quoting Professor Gaum of Rutgers 
University who claims, that laughter 
is an indication of intelligence, and 
that of all the degrees of laughter, 
the laughter at one's self rates the 
highest. Somehow wc’rc inclined to 
agree, with the good professor.

NU SIGMA ALPHA HOLDS 
ANNIVERSARY DANCE
Fraternity Pledges Eleven 
Night Students For 
Membership
On December 26 Nu Sigma Alpha 
held the most succcssful affair in 
the history of the organization.. The 
celebration was held in commemora­
tion of the fourth anniversary of 
the founding of the fraternity. 
Dancing and cards were the order 
of the affair, and members, guests 
and friends enjoyed, the evening to 
the fullest.
Professor and Mrs. Robert B. 
Lcighou, and Professor and Mrs. 
H. K. KirkPatrick*, patron members, 
graccd the occasion by their pres­
ence.
Will Ryshanck and his' orchestra 
were engaged to furnish the music 
and the numerous cncores .after 
each dancc demonstrated in no 
small way the popularity of this 
campus group of music students.
The Ball Room in addition to 
the Green, Windsor and Lincoln 
Rooms of the Pcnn-Lincoln Hotel, 
was pressed into service in order to 
accommodatc the large attendance 
at the dancc. At the termination 
of the party, all those present par­
took of a Buffet Dinner which was 
new as well as novel.
A call was made by the fraternity 
during the evening to honor sev^- 
cral night students who had bccomc 
eligible for membership at this time. 
Those men who were called by 
Preceptor . Hodder and pledged • to 
the Fraternity were John C. Aird, 
Jr., L. J. Bcckcr, Frank T: Boyd, 
Clarian R. Gilbert, Jr., Eugene V, 
Herrmann, Louis T. Hun, Russel 
A. Lahr, Samuel J. Nikhazy, Milton 
O. Peach, Herbert B. Stone, and 
Walter B. Wendt.
The Junior Prom Committee is 
very grateful to the Delta Skulls 
for their aid in narrowing down the 
large field of orchestras and every 
effort, will be made to secure one 
of these orchestras for the Prom.
NIGHT ENGINEERING 
BANQUET HELD DEC. 17
Notice the great big broad smile 
on some of the Night Engineers 
faces? Well, that is significant of 
the fact that they attended the seven­
teenth annual banquet of Night 
Engineers, held at Webster Hall 011 
December 19. And was it a banquet? 
Ask someone who attended the af­
fair and then you'll know what you 
missed if you didn't- show up for 
your share of the fun. Of course, a 
few of the boys seemed to enjoy the 
affair somewhat more than the others 
due chiefly -to one little entertainer 
acting in the role of Mistress of 
Ceremonies. I won’t mention any 
names so don’t be upset if you were 
one of them and want to keep it 
away from the girl friend’s cars. 
You know, right after the affair was 
over, one certain fellow told me that 
he didn’t get any fun out of being 
“sung at.” Imagine a guy like that. 
I notice though that he was not 
"sung at" anyway and I think he’s 
just jealous of some of the rest of 
us. Some people never do grow up. 
I like to sec the fellows attend the 
banquet and act like great big “kids.” 
They enjoy themselves more and 
feel better afterwards. They can even 
wear red neckties, if they care to, 
and here again I am not mention­
ing names but one guy was mean 
enough to wear one and just about 
covcrcd everything.
Well anyway, the banquet was one 
grand affair from soup to finale and 
I think the Engineering Officers de­
serve one big lot of crcdit for put- 
ting it over in the way they did. 
The affair can now be safely listed 
as the seventeenth succcssful banquet 
so now let's congratulate the present 
officers and look forward to another 
big affair next year.

TRAINING—EDUCATION
Industry and educational institu­
tions in the past years have tried to 
co-ordinate theoretical and practical 
training. Industry realizes that it 
must depend upon education to in­
fuse new ideas into the work being 
carried on. The schools and colleges 
know that they must turn out men 
and women who arc capable of fit­
ting into the general schcmc of 
industrialism. This realization on the 
part of both tends to bring the two 
together with mutual benefit.
The collcgc can only present cer­
tain material to the minds of its stu­
dents and hope that they have so 
formed their mode of thinking that 
these students will be able to, use 
the material as they sec fit. There 
arc too many today who pursue 
their studies in collcgc and find it 
difficult to make any progress be­
cause the matter seems to be too 
abstract. Of course the lack of 
proper co-ordination is felt more 
keenly in the engineering field be­
cause of the elose conncction between 
engineering studies and .industry.
Many schools arc offering co­
operative courses as a means to 
sccurc a better practical' education. 
Students studying at night school 
and working during the day in a 
certain field arc greatly benefited 
by this two-fold pursual of knowl­
edge.
The only unfortunate part of our 
educational system is its narrowness. 
One would think that the sole use 
of education was to sccurc a better 
job or a higher salary. It seems as 
if few really desire education be­
cause it gives the mind greater lati­
tude—an opportunity to understand 
the best and finest in life, granted 
that only so much can be squeezed 
into a four-year course, wouldn’t it 
be possible to supply an individual 
.with other subjects during the early 
years in school or even in the home. 
It is quite evident that the change 
in the school system whereby the 
responsibility of instruction hits been 
shifted from the home to the school­
room has succccdcd in making many 
know a little but permitting. lew to 
expand to the limits of their capabili­
ties.

Tickets For Little Theater?
“Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to 
you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many 
of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my 
lines.” And Dean Itccblc’s young proteges have heeded 
so well Shakespeare’s advice that all Pittsburgh knocks at 
the doors of their Little Theater. The Art School Office is 
besieged with requests for cards of admission, and every 
evening long queues line the halls before the1 Little Theater 
doors, and students constantly complain of their inability 
to secure the coveted tickets. THE TARTAN feels that 
an explanation of the situation and perhaps a suggestion for 
its improvement might be helpful.
The Little v Theater, with a seating capacity of four 
hundred, was created to provide an audience for the students 
of drama, whose laboratory work—the actual production of 
plays—would be incomplete without one. The iftrformances 
there are really classes for the participants, and as such are 
a regular part of their curiculum, and to be permitted to 
witness them is a high privilege. That this audience might 
prove to be of greatest possible value to the young actors, 
men and women from all walks of life were invited to at­
tend—doctors, critics, lawyers, politicians, artists, steno­
graphers, engineers, and housewives. Today the names of 
these early loyal patrons, together with those of the faculty, 
make up the subscription list of the Little Theater. With­
out their support it could not have attained to the high 
position which it now occupies in the dramatic world and 
brought to Carnegie Tech the fame and friends which it has.
Student opinion is a valuable part of the judgment of 
these performances of the drama students, and so, in ac­
cordance with an agreement made with Student Council 
some time ago, thirty tickets for every performance are sent 
to the Registrar’s Office for their use. Also, any extra 
tickets remaining 011 the morning of the day of the per­
formance arc available to them. Obviously, an average of 
¦ two hundred and fifty tickets for a student body of over 
twenty-five hundred is inadequate. Granted that some stu­
dents are not interested in seeing the plays, there are still 
a great many who would like to see them, and who would 
prove an intelligent and desirable addition to any audience.;
The Department of Drama has recognized this fact by 
announcing matinee performances and, upon occasions, 
special evening performances for students. The evening 
performances, however, have not worked out very well, be­
cause many students find it impossile to attend upon a given 
evening.
The suggestion .has been made to THE TARTAN that 
cards good for a given number of admissions to the Little 
Theater be issued to each student at registration. These 
cards could then be punched at the registrar’s office every 
time they were exchanged for tickets. The difficulties here 
lie with the number of punches to be allowed each student 
and in the equable distribution1 of the attendance. Another 
remedy for the situation might be effected by putting 
faculty members upon the same basis as students in the 
matter of ticket-preference.
Certainly Student Council might inquire into (the possi­
bilities of bettering the situation with profit to the student 
.body which it represents. Some more satisfactory agree­
ment as to the method of distributing Little Theater tickets 
might be reached with the Department of Drama and the 
Board of Administration.

Engineering Students and Extra-Curricular 
Activities
An investigation was conducted recently at the Penn­
sylvania State College to determine whether or not the 
faculty was working the engineering student too hard and 
monopolizing an unfair portion of his time. In carrying 
out the survey the average engineering student was com­
pared with an average liberal arts student with respect to 
the manner in which each husbanded their 163 hours of the 
week. The results, especially those r»ertainino- to extra-cur­
ricular activities, are interesting.
COME RIGHT IN!
FROM THE FENCE
How About It?---
Now that everyone is turning over new leaves, making resolutions, etc., why not the men’s honorarics around this institution? We can’t kickmuch about the Mortar Board and Cwcns; Ofcourse they could do better but every now and then you hear of them sponsoring this or doing that for someone. The Druids are supposed to be the cream of last year’s Freshmen. If you ever had a peek at a Druid meeting when bids are de­cided on you would wonder if merit had a -whole lot to do with the choice. To the Druids falls the managing of the Soph Hop the Soph Banquet and most important of all- the enforcing of Freshman Regulations. Could the enforcement of Regulations be carried out in u ch worse than in recent years? The Delta Skulls have little to do but run a lavish Prom and dab­ble a bit with t h e Thistle. 
Their big job is to rope in enough class offices to assure themselves ol a .Dragon hat. How many of YOU know who YOUR class officers arc? This year’s group of Dragons have acted wisely in tlieir Student Council actions and in aiding the Campus traditions. Let us hope they can continue thus till spring. Men should be known for the good they do as well as for the dinjes they wear. How about Alpha Tau, Tan Bet Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, Pi Delta Epsilon, and some of the others? You never hear of them ex­cept on call days. They could do good if they would, too. Class and scholastic honorarics amount In something at other schools; why not here? . . . * * * *
Another Year With What?—
No use retrospecting about last year but believe us there arc plenty of improvements that could be made around this place in the coming twelve moons. Puppet came out with an Christmas issue with a fairly good cover for a change but they had to fall back on an old-timer, Larry Stultz, to get it. Somehow Or other the ancient belly laughs about the embalming fluid and the roach powder crept into the issue. The Puppet gave the Bache­lors’ Club a big hand, but what for? Their aim has declined from acting like bachelors to merely trying not to appear too serious with any one girl. 1 hat s not so distinctive! Almost everjr issue seems to be-chicfly an exchange issue. Originalitv would make something of the magazine, look at Ballyhoo . . . The school chops up the walk by the gym and about a year or so later relays the walk. How about the walk along Forbes, between Beeler and
It was disclosed that an engineering student spends 30 
hours per week in class and 30 hours in preparation; the 
liberal arts student, on the other hand, devotes IS hours in 
the classroom and'SO hours in preparation. Since the en­
gineering students slept as much, spent an equal amount 
of time on minimumessentials (meals, dressing, to:and from 
classes, etc.) and did not permit his health to suffer, he 
was consequently compelled to minimize his extra-curricular 
activities. To quote the statistics, the engineering students 
functioned in 23 per cent of the activities, whereas the lib­
eral arts students participated in 46 per cent of the extra­curricular activities.
Possibly this accounts for the diminishing interest in 
extra-curricular activities by men at Carnegie—the encroach­
ment of the administration upon the time of the students; 
I11 the majority of the minor sports the turnout of the 
candidates^ is never that anticipated. In fact a number of 
sports which are prominent at other colleges do not even 
exist at, Carnegie: lacrosse, soccer, and hockey. Such a 
condition is further lamentable because a large number of . 
wholesome professional activities among the engineering 
students have never been initiated or have long ago died a 
natural death. As an example many of the student branches 
of the various engineering organizations, Society of Industrial 
Engineers, A. S. Ch. E., etc., exist in name only, since the 
students cannot devote sufficient time to these activities to assure their success.
It is often remarked that the average engineering stu­
dent is socially uncultured, his English "is crude, and that 
his outlook is narrow. This is not surprising when it is 
considered that lie is given only approximately 10 hours 
per week for recreation or other broadening activities.
To this little difficulty the faculty holds the key. They 
control the day’s work of the engineering student, for most 
undergraduates arc ambitious to successfully accomplish 
the daily tasks put forth by the professors. ' The faculty 
of Carnegie might, for example, discontinue to reduce 9 
unit courses to 6 unit courses covering exactly the same material.

GRADUATE WORK
Woodlawn? . Surely the condition of that walk de­serves some consideration. It surely is a mess for the dorm girls to have to traipse back and forth thru in wet weather. ... It would be awfujly nice if the drama department would give the student body a better break and give them a chance to see some of the plays. Most of them are worth seeing. . . . The school keeps most of the clocks at varying times and rings the bells at still another time. Then the student catche^- it because he can’t dope the' puzzle out. . . . The school has erectedtwo monuments in the past twelvemonth, ThistleI-Iall and the Glorified Junk Yard. Now that they have a nice junk‘yard they might turn their atten­tion to a library. . . . Then, of course, this column could be greatly improved, but what can you ex­pect? . . .* * * *
Back to the Mills—
Ho hum, ain’t it awful to have to get up for 8:30s after a couple of weeks of sleeping in morn­ings, that is, most of us. The girls at the dorms, flying into each others arms, etc., and showing off the spoils they reaped from the spirit of the sea­son. The men, much less gushy about things,grunt “Oh, some.ties and hankies” if anyone asks how they made out. Then there arc the people that you forget to send cards to who must be thanked, and •then the Soph Hop soon and then exams to worry about in the near future. Say, did you see the elaborate electrical decorations on most of the houses in Mt. Lebanon? Every eve­ning for a week after Christmas West Liberty avenue was jammed with cars taking people to see the sight which surely didn’t look like de­pression times.. . . A number of the frat boys got b a c k i 11 time to throw N cwYcar's parties. Now that the Fresh­
men have moved in the houses they will findthat fraternity life is not quite as pictured in the movies and by Rushing Week. . . . During the holidays Los Angeles, ¡11 the Land of Eternal Sun­shine and Summer, drew an eight-inch .snowfallwhile all we could get was rain. Oh, the wintersain’t what they used to be when we were kids. NoSirec! . . . The poker marathon being conducted by a gang of engineers continued for a dajr after the close of school but was finally discontinued until after the holidays^ . . . Now that the musicians got starved out we have stage shows at our pic­ture palaces again. Not only that but famous movie stars in person! . . .

Freshmen and Activities
Now that the student body has 
gotten down to real work and the 
freshmen have found that all their 
time’doesn’t have to be put on their 
studies it is well to speak of activi­
ties.
What a nuisance that word is to 
some freshmen who have pledged 
themselves to a fraternity! They 
soon begin to believe 'that activities 
arc some sort of deities solely creat­
ed for upper classmen to prostrate 
themselves before. To the freshmen 
they soon become an evil to be 
avoided.
It is easy to see the freshman
point of view, especially in regard 
to some of the activities. It isn’t
necessary to urge one to come out 
for football where fame and glory 
may be the reward, but to explain
why it is advantageous to put in
several hours every day as a “frosh” 
manager or writing up reams of ma­
terial for the publications is a dif­
ferent matter.
The chief advantage that one can 
obtain from participation in one or 
several activities is a wider circle of 
friends. Some, it is true, will soon 
be forgotten but others will remain, 
with you for life. Next to the benefit 
of acquiring new friends would come 
the advantage that participation in 
activities brings to the graduate who 
is looking for a job. The men who 
come to Carnegie Tech to interview 
men for their companies do not look 
entirely to their scholastic records 
but put a great deal of emphasis on 
the part the men have played on the 
campus. A man who has no activities 
to his credit is often passed over for 
the man whose list of accomplish­
ments would lead one to believe that 
he at least has a pleasing personality 
and the ability to make contacts.
And last, but, to the minds of 
many, not least, the freshman who 
comes to Tech with the ambition to 
become something 011 the campus, to 
belong to some of the many prom­
inent honor societies that abound on 
the Carnegie campus, must have ac­
tivities and more activities before 
he can enter those sacred bonds.
The most important thing that the 
freshman should remember is that lie 
is not doing any one else a favor by 
coming out. He is helping himself. 
The benefits accruc to him, and while 
in some cases his fraternity may 
bask in his reflected glor3r, he is real­
ly building for his future.

Serving as special dancing part­
ners at dances given by a fashion­
able young women’s finishing school 
near Boston is one of the unoffi­

The real reason is to sec that 
there are no “wall-flowers” at the

At the Thanksgiving dances at

rated which, it is expected, will 
become a tradition. In the center 
of the ballroom there stood a rose

rings of all the cadets. As each 
cadet claimed his ring he was re­
quired to kiss his guest as he plac­
ed the ring upon her finger.

NEWS FROM THE FILES
One of our faded traditions is 
the parade of the plebes on All- 
Fools’ Day. On this day the fresh­
men arrayed themselves in any cos­
tume fitting for the occasion. The 
best dressed student from each school 
was given exemption from plebe regu­
lations for the remainder of the 
term. In 1^26, the name of the day 
was changed from Poverty Day to 
All Fools’ Day. Later, the Plebe 
Prom was substituted and now, sad 
to say, the tradition has vanished 
entirely.
Way back in 1926 Professor Dibble 
of the Pleating and Ventilating de­
partment said that the broadcasting 
of heat by radio would be only a 
matter of a few years. “It is no 
more impossible to broadcast heat 
waves than it was to broadcast sound 
waves,” he said. “The problems be­
fore the research and laboratory 
workers are to discover instruments 
to control the waves, especially a 
detector instrument which will pick 
up, hold, and amplify them."
Did you know that the department 
of Machinery was once the name of 
the department of Works Manage­
ment?
It used to be a custom for the
junior class of each college to plant 
a tree on the campus on Arbor Day, 
That is, it was the custom in 1926.
All the Maggie Murphs remember 
the exams given to the freshmen, 
just before Color Day. Long, long 
time ago—1926—the first exams werq 
given to the freshmen and fifteen 
girls failed on the activity questions.
Another faded tradition is the 
Gambol of the Guilds. This was an. 
annual affair held by Industries’ stu­
dents. The first gambol 10 be held 
was called the Frolic of the Labor­
ers. Each man on entering the Union 
was given a "time card” listing the 
schedule of “jobs" to be done that 
evening. On this list was put the 
order of the dances—“Job No.": the 
time—“Time of Job”: the partner—» 
"Helper.”
February 19, 20, 21, 1926, Mortar 
Board held a sectional conference at 
Carnegie Tech. Delegates from West 
Virginia University, the "Jnivcrsity 
of Michigan, Ohio State, and Pitt 
attended.
In the same month the Men's 'Gle'4 
Club made a trip - to Canton and 
Akron, Ohio. After the concert», 
dances were held in both cities.

Makers of telephone equipment cannot rely on their eyes in test­
ing a certain type of coil used by the million in central offices. For 
greater accuracy they utilize the "electric eye” or photoelectric cell. 
At Western Electric this uncanny piece of apparatus 
"stares” all day long without fatigue recording galvanometer readings. 
tL It forms a vital part of a machine for automatically separating 
perfect from imperfect coils. Its use is typical of the way this organ­
ization puts science to practical advantage. Ct, Here is no hlind fol­
lowing of tradition. And yet new methods must prove themselves 
worthy—must he tested as carefully and as thoroughly as the tele­
phones and telephone equipment manufactured for the Bell System.
