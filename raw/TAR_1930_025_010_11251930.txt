OWLS TAKE TO AIR
Owls Brought to Earth 
After Scoring Two 
Touchdowns
By Joe Michaclson 
With a casual thought of a 
Thanksgiving dinner, Carnegie’s 
gridiron eleven cooked the goose 
so sacred to the Temple Owls. 
This slaughter was all in (the course 
of Saturday’s grid schedule, the 
closing whistle of which blew to 
the tunc of 32 to 13, thereby an­
nouncing Carnegie’s fifth victory of 
the season.
The large score is deceiving, in 
that it docs not bring out the fact 
\that the 60 minutes of play were 
Crowded with an exhibition of fast, 
roWli and tumble football. The 
layoff of the previous week seemed 
*/o have reconditioned the bearings 
/ of the Plaid machine which func­
tioned with the’ effectiveness of a 
new steam roller.
Owls Take to Air 
As was expected, the Owls took 
to the /air and flung passes in a 
big way; This proved ; to be a 
profitable method of pffense for the 
Philiy fellows, and was borne out 
by .the [fact that Temple’s first 
touchdown followed an aerial at- 
- .caolc iiu'thc-.openijig ¿.ten minutes. 
Throughout the remainder of the 
game, passes were thrown by both 
teams, right and left. Intercep­
tions were frequent, arid the vari­
ous officials experienced a busy 
day at changing sides.
it was early in the second quar­
ter that "Dutch” Eyth gave his 
typical flashy run’. This time lie 
crossed seven of the white lines, 
making a total of 35 yards with a 
Tartan touchdown on the end. On 
the next kickoff, Schnuppe rccov 
ercd a Temple fumble, and in the 
following play Duegcr sent the 
oval, on a 25-yard flight to the arms 
of Kavcl, who romped the 
maining 18 yards for the Skibo’s 
second touchdoAvn.
Before the whistle blew for the 
half rest, cach clevon had added a 
touchdown to its earnings. The 
Tartan’s score resulted from four 
plays begun on Temple’s 40-yard 
line. Kavcl did the honors with a 
23-yard smash through right tackle 
for the six points.
The Quaker City boys gained 
possession of a Carnegie pass 
about 30 yards from the goal, and 
their aerial efforts again' material­
ized in the form of a touchdown: 
With further interceptions the first 
half ended with the Skibos leading 
19 to 13.

Interview With Hazel Lees 
Reveals Early History 
of Department
The drama department was estab­
lished in the fall of 1913 with 
Thomas Wood Stevens as its first 
director. It was then known as
the Dramatic Art Department of _ ..................... ..................... ...............

(Hamerschlag’s Welcome—1906)
You have journeyed here from 
many states and cities for a pur­
pose which, if carried to fruition, 
will insure your love and interest 
in this institution of which you and 
I are now a part.
This day adds to the circle of 
my friends and companions the 
students who arixto form the class 
of 1909. The older I grow in years, 
the“more I am impressed with the 
common interest and mutual affec­
tion which is engendered and devel­
oped by increasing one’s friends, 
especially if they be young 
heart.
This Institution has its ideals 
and its ideas. The first is formed 
from the second, since-it is not of. 
sufficient -age to have inherited 
traditional ones. You who have 
so eagerly sought admission to its 
doors have been compelled to give 
evidence of your preparation and 
faith in yourselves, and we who 
stand here have been compelled 
to guard and exact these tests, 
so that the Institution which is inv

was established.” This tribute was 
paid to Mr. Stevens by Hazel Beck 
Lees'1, one of the first students in 
the department. "He proved,” she 
said, "that drama could be taught 
in' colleges.”
Iiv a recent interview with the 
Tartan, Mrs. Lees told of the in­
formality which characterized the 
first dramatic classes. The first 
play that was staged was a Greek 
tragedy, the "Iphigcnia” of Euri-
pedes. During the first performances 
of the play, snow was falling out­
side, and it was very cold. The
Arts school was not quite com­
pleted, and there was nothing but 
the half-finished wall at the back 
of the stage, between the. audience 
and the outside. There was no way 
of preventing the audience from 
being chilled, to say nothing of the 
players who. were garbed in not' 
overly warm Greek tunics. . On 
other occasions, Mrs. Lees explain­
ed, inclement weather prevented the 
size of the audience from being all 
that they might have desired. On 
one particularly bad night there 
were only twenty-five people in the 
theater. Mr. Stevens came o\it in 
front of the curtain arid asked them 
all to move into the front seats in 
order that they might encourage, 
the ‘ students.
At this time the department was 
considerably smaller than at pres­
ent. In Mrs. Lees’, class there 
were only eight students, * and 
naturally there, was not the organ­
ized procedure that now exists. All 
the members of the class worked 
together on one play, staging it, 
making the costumes, arranging the 
lighting, and doing the many parts 
of producing a~ play; almost every-

Athletic Association And Carnegie
Bowl Have Interesting Histories
By CHARLES C. LEEDS
We stand among the elect Today 
as regards our. positioin in the 
college athletic world, and it is 
interesting to look back to the 
small acorn from which this 
mighty oak has grown. Within a 
iew days, the local daily press has 
carried an' account of a proposal 
irom our Graduate Manager, Mr. 
Overend, to donate to the Public 
Welfare Fund the major portion 
of the proceeds from the football 
i game between Carnegie and W. & 
j j. The probabilities are that this 
generous action will add not less 
than $30,000 to the fund. If'in 
1905, or for many years after that 
date, anyone had suggested that in 
i. few years Carnegie might attract 
such a "gate,” there would have 
been ample grounds for a call be­
fore the Lunacy Commission.
The writer, in addition to his 
duties as a teacher, was T reasurcr 
and Faculty Advisor of Athletics 
during the" early days, from about 
1907 to the fail of 1909; and wc 
were very poor indeed in those far 
away days. We were obliged to 
hold the managers of the various 
teams to strict accountability, for 
every ccnt at that period, and it 
seems now, in looking back, that 
we were always in debt up to the 
limit. We had no regular income
from student fees until later, and 
in those days wre always seemed 
to be robbing Peter to pay Paul.
In the fall of 1907 Dr. Hamer­
schlag proposed an experiment, 
which was to give the public a 
free treat in football. Possibly 
this idea came, to him from the 
fact . that fcollege athletics were 
criticized even in those days. In 
any event,. Lehigh was , selected as 
our opponent and the game was 
played at Schenley Oval. The 
treasurer was expected to pay ex­
penses from \ advertising and the 
sale of programs. The Pittsburgh 
public was delighted over • the 
prospcct of free football, but was 
not interested in programs; con­
sequently, we not only lost the 
game, but wc went deeper into 
debt from the expense of bringing 
Lehigh' tb Pittsburgh.
Possibly it may be news to 
present da\v students to learn that 
the first use, for athletics, made of 
the Schenley property, now Forbes 
Field, was« by Carnegie for its 
football field. This was in the 
fall of 190S, and the University of 
Pennsylvania team came out to 
Pittsburgh as our opponent for 
our "big game.” This game was 
won by Penn and drew gross re-

This relationship docs not end at 
the outrance. . It must continue 
throughout the years of your school 
life if in the highest sense we arc 
to preserve-the-Carnegie Technical 
School for its highest destiny.
All the forces that modern indus; 
try and science have given our 
present civilization, have 'been con­
centrated and used in the construc­
tion of these buildings and the 
equipment, of these classrooms, lab­
oratories and workshops, rind to 
these have been added that which 
is much more priceless and im­
portant, a teaching staff, whose in­
tellectual equipment and personality 
arc such as to ensure1 to you in­
struction and. friendship 1 which can 
only resound to your development 
and education along those lines for 
which you show aptitude arid appli­
cation. >
The highest function and ideal 
which the ideas and personnel of 
this faculty will produce is “Man.”

Tech Schools Fight
Big Brewery Concerns
The trustees of Carnegie Technical 
Schools have declared war on a local 
company which has given the name 
TECH beer to one of. its products 
and is using the school colors to 
advertise the new beer. A unique 
scheme has been hit upon to per­
suade the brewin.r company to de­
sist advertising TECH beer. Thou­
sands of .letters are to be sent to 
the concern protesting against the 
use of- the name. It was learned this 
morning that recently some one called 
the technical schools and asked if it 
were the brewery. It was intended as 
a joke, but the offi.ials of the schools 
did not see the humor of it. .
Dauntless Carnegie 
Eleven Bows to 
Kiski Team
October 24, 1907.—Tech’s sturdy 
aggregation of football men went 
down to defeat last Saturday at 
Kiski, in a hard-fought battle that 
looked like anybody’s game until 
the' whistle blew for time. Al­
though hard playing characterized, 
the game, it was clean -throughout, 
and the treatment received at the 
hands of the Kiski men deserves 
favorable mention. Urling, \oije. of 
Tech’s most needed men, was bad­
ly hurt at the very beginning of 
the .game, and it was only by the. 
dogged grit of Bcckcn that he was 
able to remain in the game after a 
severe bruise on the knee. Several of 
the Kiski men received more or lcss; 
'severe injuries, but only one man was, 
forced to retire.
The game in detail-'showed the; 
absurdity of changing the men from 
their positions on the eve of the 
conicst'; ’ buT•regardless of this'mix-’ 
up, the boys put- up an excellent 
game and were only defeated by 
the /superior kicking of Kumier, 
the Kiski fullback.
• At 3 o’clock Referee Frey called 
Captains Kumler and Foster to the 
center of the field for instructions. 
Foster won. the toss, choosing to 
defend the west goal( with thp sun 
to Tech’s back. Kumler kicked off 
to Tech’s five-yard line, Urling re­
ceiving the ball and rushing it 
back .by clever dodging to his own 
twentyryard line. Bccken, Ramp and

Fraternity Idea Be­
comes Reality in 
Ranks of Carnegie
October; 24,- 1906.—The fraternity 
idea is now a reality in our ranks. 
There have been murmUrings in 
.and around the school in muffled 
tones since September about this 
idea. Let there be no more doubt. 
A fraternity or fraternities do exist 
at Tech. One comcs out, declares 
vil.s existence and makes no secret, 
of its intentions and what it stands 
for. The paramount issue is the 
absolute and undivided fraternal 
spirit and feeling among its mem­
bers, and the “Help the Other Fel­
low” idea will be ever in evidence. 
The fellows mean to disregard all 
school politics, realizing that that 
factor in fraternities in- general 
does most to quash school spirit 
and keep the. offices among the 
selected few.
It might be well also at this time 
to make an allusion or two to this 
same thing called school politics. 
Perhaps one of the least glorious 
victories a man may gain is one 
which he has gained by taking the 
position of suppliant and begging 
for votes, and has had his lieuten­
ants do likewise. No man need 
tell the fellows that he is the best 
man for the office—a body like 
ours is quick to find out the man 
they -wish to place their trust in. 
Let us keep out this annihilator of 
school spirit, viz., Politics, for all 
times. 9
Maggie Murphs To
Organize Basketball
Oct. 31, 1906.—It is understood 
that within a very short time the 
girls of the Margaret Morrison Car­
negie School for Women intend or­
ganizing a basket ball team. As 
they put'it, they intend to make it 
superior to any'-other girls team in 
the country. They say this may 
sound' like boasting, yet considering 
that many of the girls have played 
befprc, they have 110 ’icsitation in 
saying that they will fulfill their 
purpose. As one girl puts it, “We 
do not intend to maltreat or;, kill 
any person in our scrimmages (at 
least not wilfully), but we do intend 
to put into the game all the enthus­
iasm and vim necessary to carry off 
honors.”
CARNEGIE’S GIFT TO 
PITTSBURGH YOUTH
Tech School Life Sadly 
In Need of Enlivening
November 17, 1906.—It is the
opinion of .a large number, of the 
student bod}', that the social 
end of the . Tech school life 
is sadly in need of being livened up 
and toward this end there have been 
many suggestions, the mos^ common 
of'which perhaps is the establishing, 
as a tradition, of a reception and 
ball to ,be known as “Junior 
Promenade.” Whether this. sort of 
function would find the support of 
the fellows is rather hard to say; 
although as has been said, a goodly 
number-* have pledged their support. 
If you think well of this, talk it up, 
and perhaps before the 1908 class 
become Seniors, the “Prom” may be­
come a reality. HELP IT ALONG.
PROCLAMATION
Class of 1908
When in the course of college 
events, it becomes necessary, for 
the welfare of the school and of 
the Plebes themsevles, that they be 
taught their places in relation to 
the JUNIOR CLASS and the In­
stitution, we the said JUNIOR 
CLASS do proclaim and announce 
these rules to be followed and 
obeyed strictly by the Plebes:
I. The operation of drawing in 
and blowing out of tobacco smoke 
by said Plebes shall not, under any 
circumstances, be permitted in the 
buildings.
II. Said Plebes shall not'loiter 
on front steps or on pavement di­
rectly in front of them.
III. Said Plebes shall not ascend 
aforesaid steps and enter by upper 
aperture, as this is to be kept 
Holy and used only by faculty and 
CLASS OF 1908.
IV. Said Plebes shall not wear 
plaid’in any form till after Easter.
V. Said Plebes shall not wear 
any insignia, numerals, letters or 
pin of any other schools.
VI. Said Plebes shall not pour 
hot metal upon themselves, as the 
odor of burning flesh is disagree­
able to the JUNIORS.
Above rules decreed and approved 
by the CLASS OF 1908.
New Margaret Morri­
son Building Nears 
Completion
Feb. 27, 1907—The opening of the 
new Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School for Women will mark the 
beginning of something entirely* new 
and original in educational institu­
tions for women. The building, which 
will occupy the central position of 
the group of buildings, is nearing- 
completion, and it is assured that 
regular school work will begin there 
about ~ the latter - part of March. 
Equipment has been ordered and is 
arriving daily for the various' de­
partments, and is of such character 
that there can be little doubt as to 
the policy of the courses, which is 
primarily to teach young women to 
earn a living.
The building is ^a large four-story 
edifice, of the same gcnerkl type of 
architecture as the men’s school: The 
basement will be given over to the 
laundry department, which will be 
equipped for teaching the machine 
and hand' methods. There will be a 
strain washing machine, centrifugal 
extractor, starching machine, steam 
dryer,, mangle, soap mixer, set tubs,' 
up-to-date ironing boards, electric 
and gas irons.
On the first floor will be the Faculty 
rooms, general and private offices, 
Biological, Physical and Chemical 
Laboratories, general 'lecture and 
class rooms, and.a locker room which 
will contain a new type of locker 
that will have ample' space Jor the 
reception\of any hat, however large.
Day Students Rally
' At Theater Party
On' Saturday ni^lit, October 20, 
the day school* of Applied Science 
attended the Nixon theater in a body. 
Tech wa's very much in evidence 
during the -entire performance, and 
it was the unanimous feeling amongst 
the fellow B that it was a royal good 
time.
Barney Oldfield, who drove the 
winning car in the auto race, had the 
plaid colofs on the front of his 
machine, and when the fellows saw 
the Tartan in thife lead the}' naturally 
went wild.-“Rph! Rah! Rah! Tech!” 
and “Rah! Rah! Rah! Oldfield!!’ 
^resounded throughout the hou^e. Miss 
Elsie Janis, who played the star role, 
came before the footlights,in the last 
set with a beautiful bouquet of 
flowers tied with -the school colors, 
which was very pleasing to all the 
students.' Cheers for W. U. P., Kiski 
and Miss Janis were, given, together 
with 1 man}r long Techs; the ¡hew 
school .song was also sung, accom­
panied b.- the orchestra.
Tartan Congratulates 
Men and Co-Eds on 
School Spirit
October 24, 1906.—The Tartan 
wishes to congratulate all Tech 
men upon the sudden outburst of 
enthusiasm and expression of 
school spirit shown during their 
preparation for the Kiski game, 
This same element of school spirit 
has been rather of an unknown 
quantity in the past, and with the 
number, of fellows we have, and 
with the type and standard of .the 
school, it has been a deplorable 
condition. The spirit, as shown by 
last week’s experience, lies asleep 
somewhere and only needs awaken­
ing to make itself known. Let us 
one and all strive to awaken this 
new and most valuable element in 
school life. Let it be the duty of 
every man to do some single, help­
ful work for every school\ organi­
zation. Every organization is sore­
ly in need of your jupport—not 
financial alone—though that support

Dear Mr. Editor:
You ask me to give the readers 0/ “The Thistle” some account of 
the inception of and my reasons for 
deciding to give to Pittsburgh the 
Technical Schools.
First, then, please note that Pitts­
burgh was the home of my boyhood, 
and it was there that Fortune 
showered its favors upon me in 
early manhood. One* earnestly wishes 
to benefit his early home and its 
people if ever it be in his power.

braries maintained by the people, a 
hall for music, a fine art gallery, 
and a museum would all tend to edu­
cate , and elevate our citizens and 
bring into their lives new • elements 
of happiness, and had established 
these, 1 found myself casting about 
to find the next want that Pittsburgh 
most needed. I was often brought 
into contact with mCn in Britain arid

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, lfcfl.THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE TWO
JOHN ALMS
WAY BACK IN 1906 when Carnegie was but a yearling 
institution, the night students were also eligible to play football; 
in fact, an editorial published in the TARTAN at that time was 
nothing more than a disguised plea for “the brawn and muscle 
of the night students."
Just how they found time to work, go to school, and play 
football is explained by the way the grid game was played in 
those days. The teams were little better than those of the 
secondary schools such as Kiski, Shadyside Academy', and East 
Liberty Academy, all of which appeared on the 1906 varsity 
schedule.
Modern football, however, eliminates night atudcntB for 
several reasons. First of all, scholastic eligibility prevents their 
participation in the game, and secondly, the collcgc griddcrs of 
today are virtually night students in football because of the 
mental drills which usually follow the daily workouts.* :|f * *
BUDDY OVEREND captained the first hockey team ever 
to represent Carnegie. The squad consisted of ten skaters, 
which in those days allowed but three men for substitutions. 
After but two practices, the team bucked Yale’s ice men and 
held them to a score)ess tie the first half. The second period, 
however, gave the Elis five points while Carnegie scored none. 
Of the remaining two games on the season’s schedule, Captain 
'Overend’s men won one and lost one.
A hockey team at Carnegie today would be beyond1 reason. 
It would, for one thing, be a certain financial failure because of 
the increased popularity of basketball and because of the diffi­
culties which would arise in securing a battle ground and in
arranging a schedule. And after all, there may not even be
.enough material.
* ¡K * * *
THE FIRST YEAR’S REPORT of the Athletic Associa­
tion would not be amiss for publication in the PUPPET, when 
compared with current reports. For instance, football receipts 
for the year amounted to $631.72 and the expenses totaled 
«$792.46. Basketball made no returns whatever to the Athletic 
Association, while expenditures were $15.20. Track was a liabil­
ity to the extent of $5.00. Baseball and tennis were both un­
profitable, the deficit incurred by the former being $135.56, while 
that of the racquet gamc^was $43.43. ..Subscriptions from the 
students, the Glee Club, Night Applied Sciences, and Athletic 
Association tickets served to boost the income to within $4.02 
of the expenditures for the year. Incidentally, the year’s busi­
ness amounted to but $1,136.07, which is less than the cost of 
one set of uniforms for the first team nowadays.
another and still others in the race 
of life.
It is to teach you how to attain 
to this end -that this School was 
founded, and my advice to you, if 
you wish to reach the end of your 
school days stamped as "Productive 
Men” is: Work Hard; be accurate; 
concentrate your energy; be clean; 
play fairly, and smile ¦while fighting 
hardest. These arc the milestones 
that mark your progress to gaining 
self-control, character and ability. 
If you get all of these, get them 
for use as soon as possible, and 
while as young as you can, so that, 
the period of your cultivation does 
not carry you into decay before 
life’s race is run.
FIRST DIRECTOR GIVES 
IDEALS FOR CARNEGIE
propose to administer, most of you 
may be developed into strong, 
virile, productive men.
Strength and virility arc not 
wholly attributes of birth, whether 
having reference to brain or body, 
since they can be cultivated and 
trained if the material is good for 
the process. One of the methods 
we have adopted, to train these 
faculties ‘ is termed "self-control," 
and therefore from this hour the 
control of this student body has 
been vested in yourselves. Let your 
manhood and your manliness give 
allegiance and attention to your 
representatives, and discipline will 
require no other incentive than 
honor, to make the system effective.
•"Just one more view of the men 
we hope to produce! Productive 
men. What a wonderful phrase it 
is, meaning so much and so clearly 
that no one of us can misunder­
stand. The productive man must 
be trained and developed, just as 
the productive field must be cul­
tivated and sowed, and warmed by 
the sun, and cooled -by the dew, 
and watered by the rains, and fin­
ally reaped in good season, so that 
the period of fruiting be not ex­
tended to the period of decay.
So the youth who enters here 
must, by his own effort, study the 
laws of cause and effect, practice 
concentration and creatively think 
for himself, so that his mind may 
work out for itself those reasoning 
processes which arc necessary in 
the long days "when school days 
‘are past and your brain must match

All our ideals arc men, because

Men, however, arc composed of 
many types, just as no two of the

power or preparation. You all

Today is Dollar Day. For alum­
ni this means a date on which they 
are afforded ah opportunity to con­
tribute any amount from a dollar 
up to the Carnegie Endowment 
Fund, Inasmuch as this is also 
Carnegie Day on which the twenty- 
fifth anniversary of the founding 
of this school is being celebrated, 
it seems especially fitting that 
alumni should take this means to 
commemorate this event.
Dollar Day has become an an­
nual event at Carnegie, as it has 
been observed for the past three 
years. The plan was originated by 
John L. Porter whose idea was to 
raise money for the Endowment 
Fund through the Alumni ^Office.
Under the Endowment Fund 
Plan, Carnegie must raise,four mil­
lion dollars by 1946. At this time, 
if the required amount has been 
received, the Carnegie Corporation 
has agreed to double the principal 
plus the interest. Thus the sooner 
the money is turned in, the’ more 
interest it will acruc. However, 
contributions may be made at any 
time during the school year and 
still be accredited to the Dollar 
Day Funds. Checks should be 
made payable to the Alumni Feder­
ation and sent to the Alumni Office.
At the Carnegie Day exercises 
held today in Carnegie Music Hall, 
the twenty-five classes from 1908 to 
1932 will be represented by at least 
one member from each class. These 
representatives have been invited

One year older now since the 
Alupini had .. their home-coming 
•week. The floor of Administration 
hall was again decorated with four 
more new plates designating four 
more classes which have gone out 
to the world proclaiming the 
•wonders of Carnegie — and why 
shouldn't they? Isn’t this the 
"best placr j'ou ever knew. I know 
it is and that is why I go here at 
night. ’
Yes, ,1 am gbing to be at ‘.lie 
dance on Friday because I know 
what kind ' of affairs the Night 
Student Council conducts. Even if 
I don’t have time to study, I still 
have time to dance and anyhow 
-what would college be without the 
dances they have once in a while. 
I don’t care if they don’t have 
school, T aril going to work—I 
mean dance on Friday the 28th of 
November, and how, well, just 
watch me.'
Somebody must be riding the 
yellow horses in front of the Arts 
Building. At leasts it would ap­
pear so, especially on the dark 
nights which we have had recently. 
It was a common occurrence to 
run into the long bars which were 
saddled on the backs of the horses. 
They extended completely across 
the pavements and before you 
knew it you were right up against 
•the bars. Somebody will get run 
down and then maybe we will 
have , the ornamental gates I sug­
gested a / few weeks ago. Let’s 
hope so anyhow. Who wants to 
have the yellow horses and iron 
bars staring them in the face all 
-their life?
Glad to see the Industries 
Students can now find their rooms. 
I tried playing that game over 
there1 once, and did I have fun, 
w,eU, . :I found myself on the .third 
floor looking for some room which 
by all indications should be in the 
basement—and it was, but how 
was I to know it without a guide. 
Those charts should be a great 
help to the night Industries men.
The Kiltie Band is surely a gr. 
organization. I have heard them 
play, and my one wish is that I 
could -blow a horn like that big one 
which grows around the player’s 
neck. L am sure it would be 'fun 
playing it and carrying it too. I 
think I will apply for the job. Then 
their uniforms, well t’'cy arc just 
the best ever. They certainly make 
a great showing on the grid, or in 
fact anywhere they g~, they arc the 
outstanding feature for Carnegie.
Wonder how the . song contest 
is going along. I would like to 
write a song or two if I could, 
but how can I when I am a mono­
tone or sonic such thing. I couldn’t 
carry a tune from here to the Com­
mons let alone write one. Guess 
I better let the writing of the 
songs to those who know how to 
do it and wish them luck. I do 
hope, however, that some night 
student will win one of the prizes.
FOUR OFFICERS FROM j 
NIGHT ENGINEERING | 
COMPLETES COUNCIL!
Notice to Night Stu­
dent Council Workers
I Preparations for the Thanksgiving 
Recess Dance to be held November 
28 will be made, as far as possible, 
on Thursday morning, November 27. 
All tliose night students who have 
sent in their names to the Council 
as wishing, to work are expected, 
unless you have been told otherwise, 
to be on hand at the. Gymnasium on 
Thursday at 10:00 a. m. to help to 
get the hall Jn shape for Friday eve­
ning. Thir notice applies to the so­
cial committee as well as the Night 
Student Council Officers.
H. E. Mauro, Chairman.
The four officers elcctcd by the 
Night College of Engineering to 
represent them in the Night Student 
Council come with experience which 
should enable them to give the 
best service possible both to the col­
lege and the student body as well. 
The'four night students elected are 
Mr. Robert W. Graham, President; 
Mr. William k. Hoddcr, Vice Presi­
dent; Air. Thaddcus J. Werner, Sec­
retary, and Mr. Matthew A. Craw­
ford, Treasurer. With the election 
of these four men, the council staff 
was completed and the new Council 
commenced to function.
Mr. Graham has spent five years 
on the campus, and is registered in 
the Metallurgical Engineering Course. 
Last year was his first year to 
actively participate in the activities. 
He was Treasurer of the. Night Col­
lege of Engineering, and a member 
of the Night Studcn* Council. He 
assisted the Council wherever pos­
sible and with the experience gained 
lie will be better able to help along 
in the many projects which the 
Council sponsors. He is , a member 
of Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity.
Mr. Hoddcr has spent eight years 
on/the! campus, and is now registered 
in the Mechanical Engineering Course. 
He has had several years experience 
in the night activities on the cam­
pus. He served three years on the 
social committee, and last year was 
the chairman of this committee. The 
successes of the dances last year were 
in a large measure due to his ef­
forts. He has always supported the 
Night Student Council in its .various 
activities and is an untiring worker. 
Both the former Skibo, and the- 
present Plaid have 'been aided by 
his contributions. He is a member of 
Nu Lambda Phi, Nu Sigma Alpha, 
and Phi Nu fraternities.
Mr. Werner, also a night student 
in Mechanical Engineering, has spent 
five y<?ars -on the campus. Two years 
ago he became active in the night 
activities and gave them his loyal 
support. He was a member of last 
year’s social committee, and has con-, 
tributcd articles to the Skibo and the 
Plaid. In addition to his studies, he 
always manages to find litne to help 
the Council when called- upon: He 
is a. member of Nu Sigma Alpha 
Fraternity.
Mr.’ Crawford, a night student in 
the . Electrical Engiti :ei-.. g Course, 
has spent four years on the campus. 
For two years he has been ‘support­
ing the Council Dances and has been 
regularly in attendance. lie , is a 
member of Phi Nil Fratcrnit}'.
The next function to be sponsored 
by the Night College of Engineering 
is the Annual Banquet, and tho four 
officers elcctcd this year are doing 
everything to make this affair a 
unique success. They have already 
started the preliminary work and the 
the tickets for the affifir will be out 
shortly. The night students of 
Engineering should support them in 
making this affair bigger and better. 
Get behind them.

duced.
About 1917,. the department pro­
duced a, play appropriate to the 
outbreak of the war, called “The 
Drawing of the §word," written and 
staged by Mr. Stevens.. The cast 
presented the play is several cities 
outside of Pittsburgh and had great 
success with. it. About this time, 
Richard Mansfield II was a student 
in the department.
In its earliest days, the depart­
ment was very fortunate in having, 
as guest director, William Poel, the 
famous Shakespearian scholar. One 
of the plays which he produced here 
was “Poetaster,” a production that 
received national comment. Mr. 
Poel was later influential in secur­
ing for the department the famous 
Poel collection of Shakespearian 
ctfstumes, which* is considered one

Night Student Council 
Social Committee
Are Appointed
The social calendar of the Night 
Student Council^has. now started in 
earnest, and to properly handle the 
affairs an unusually large social com- 
miUe • has been appointed by Presi­
dent Sansonetti. This committee- is 
composed of E. M. Koch, H. Y. 
Cardinaie, A. N. Evans, F. F. Shoe­
maker, Jr., A. Gossie, F. C. Brunner, 
F. LaRosa, J. LaRosa, C? T. Biscup, 
J. M. Judge, W. V. Mullin, W. P. 
McNamai'a, H. E. Schwarzb^ch, W. 
H. Gimmell, F. S. Borkowski, F. P. 
Collins, H. E. McGannon, G. W. 
Vcssells, J. E. Wardlaw, G. E. Miller, 
V. P. Getty, S. H. Klingensmith, J. 
W. Cleary, and R. Dunn. Mr. Henry 
E. Mauro is the Social Chairman.
That this committee has a big job 
on its hands goes without saying. 
When the successes enjoyed by the 
Night Student Council in previous 
years are considered, it can readily 
be seen that this year’s committee 
will have to step some to outshine 
the work of the past committees? 
Great things are expected as many of 
the, members have had a great deal 
of experience in the social activities 
of the night college.
The committee is already hard at 
work and have promised' us some 
real surprises for the first dance of 
the y^ar on November 28 when you 
arc assured of a most enjoyable 
evening.

FIRST NIGHT ART’S 
DANCE TO BE HELD 
FRI. DECEMBER 6
The social season of the Night 
College of Fine Arts will be official­
ly opened with a dance on Decem­
ber 6. The affair will be held in the 
Union and the festivities will be­
gin at 9 :C0 p. m.
A social committee consisting of 
the Misses E. M. Koch, II. Y. 
Cardinaie and H. E. Boone, and 
Messrs. A. Gossie, F. C. Brunner, A. 
N. Evans, 1*. F. Shoemaker, Jr., E. 
L. Wenz, W. E. Hoover, Jr., E. 
DeLorenzo, J. LaKosa and K. La- 
Rosa has been appointed to assist 
the officers of the Night College of 
Fine Arts in arranging these affairs. 
This committee will commence at 
once to make arrangements for the 
first dance and from the experience 
which they have had in other affairs 
we know the first dance of the sea­
son will be a success.
Tickets arc now being distributed 
to regular night art students upon 
showing the registration card. Be 
sure to have this card with you as 
it will assure your obtaining the 
ticket for the dancc.
Thanksgiving Recess
There will be no night classes 
from Wednesday evening, Novem­
ber 26, starting at 10:30 p. m. 
until Monday evening, December 
1. This is the Thanksgiving re­
cess period. All classes will re­
sume therefore on Monday, De­
cember 1, as usual at o:30 or 7:30, 
which ever the case may be.
of the finest of the kind in exis­
tence.
The dependence of the various 
fine arts upon each other was dem­
onstrated at this time by the fact 
that a course in sight reading was 
taught. in the department by Har­
vey Gaul. The singing of French 
bergercttes and negro spirituals 
often offered much amusement, in 
addition to good training in diction.
Little remains to be. done to 
make T the Thanksgiving 'Recess 
Dancc of the Night Student Coun­
cil a complete success. Final ar­
rangements have been made and 
everything' if set for the affair.
¡Night Engineers to 
Banpei on Dec. 13
December 13.
I The next function on the social 
calendar of the Night College of 
j Engineering is the Banquet, which 
is scheduled to be held on Decem­
ber 13. Every year the night 
students of this coilcge look for­
ward to the event with a great 
deal of expectation and well they 
should, bccausc it is the outstand­
ing function of this college.
The four officers of Night En­
gineering are working at fever 
heat to make this year’s function 
bigger and better in every way. 
Tlu;y arc puting a great deal of 
time into the preparation and the 
night student body of Engineering 
should back them by their sup­
port. Full plans will be available 
for publication in next week’s issue 
of the Plaid.
The affair ha« .been moved up a 
week in order that all engineering 
students would be given an oppor­
tunity to attend before leaving for 
¡the Christmas holidays. The at­
tendance at this affair will afford 
j the students a splendid opportunity 
to meet and dine with their fel­
low students in ;i social way and
perhaps form acquaintances which 
in after years will be pleasant 
memories of the time spent at
night coilcge at Carnegie. Make 
a mental reservation of this date
aiul when the ticket salesman secs 
you be sure and get your ticket.
Mr. Henry E. Mauro, the recent­
ly appointed Social Chairman, will 
have complet e I change and we 
know from past experience that 
nothing will be lacking for a suc­
cessful evening.
Ed. Bocchicchio’s ' Venetian Sere­
naders will supply the music.. He 
will have a collection of musicians 
which will be hard to duplicate 
anywhere. Wc have had this 
group 6f men at other dances "lait 
year and know what kind of music 
they play.
Surprises are, no doubt, in store 
for.'thosc who attend, as the Com­
mittee will not give any other in­
formation. except as ^to the Or­
chestra'. They say, come and see. 
So wc expect a large number, of 
the night students to , come and 
sec.
The price of admission is $1.00 
per couple and tickets , can be ob­
tained from the night salesmen. 
Invitations arc also extended to 
the day students to attend the 
dancc.
The function will be held in the 
auditorium of the men’s gym­
nasium on. November 28. Dancing 
will b*c in order from 9:00 P. M. 
until 1:00 A. M. Take advantage 
of the holiday and enjoy yourself.

ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION
(Continued from Page One) 
ccipts of a little less than $4,000, 
of which $2,000 went to Penn as 
our guarantee, and after expenses 
were paid we were temporarily 
affluent, that is for the moment, 
for wc had about $1,400 left. Dr. 
William Marks was an end on that 
particular Penn team, and it was 
much like stopping a runaway 
Mack truck to tackle him. Emil 
Marshall was one of our out­
standing tackles that day; he later 
bccamc amateur champion heavy­
weight wrestler for this section, 
and at present is a lieutenant on 
the Pittsburgh police force, motor­
cycle division.
In the spring of 1909 we received 
bad news: the Schenlcy property 
which wc had leased was sold to 
Mr. Dreyfuss for a baseball park. 
The gloom over the campus, or 
what wc were beginning to call the 
campus at that period, was thicker 
even than the. smoke of recent 
weeks. Finally, we had a bright 
idea. Wc persuaded Mr. Reed, .of 
the Civil Engineering Department, 
to survey the ravine back of the 
Margaret Morrison College, and 
found it large enough for our pur­
pose, which was to cut off the 
hjll then existing i where the Com­
mons building now stands, and fill 
in the ravine for a field. Then, 
as means of financing the proposi­
tion, we proposed that each 
student, faculty member, and all 
friends should loan to the Athletic 
Association any sum from one 
dollar up for a period of three 
years without interest. To make 
a long story short, wc raised about 
$2,700 and the contractors were 
started to work. Naturally, the 
funds raised were not sufficient 
for completing such a job, but we 
took a chance and started the 
work, knowing that it would have 
to be paid for somehow. And it 
was; the Trustees came to the

tional lines, but for the associations 
it has allowed y,ou to form and the 
traditions to live up to.

conclusion that the grading was a 
proper charge agaist them, and 
they finished the financing of that.
Under our agreement, when Mr. 
Dreyfuss purchased the property, 
wcj wore permitted to move our 
stands over to our own field. This 
was done; then we needed a fence 
to enclose the field, for wc could 
not hope to derive income from 
the field unless it was enclosed. 
How we prevailed upon Mr. Drey­
fus s to order us to take the fence 
off of his Forbes Field property 
is one of the bright spots in mem­
ory, for it meant that we were, 
getting a $1,500 fence for the cost 
of taking it down, moving it over 
and setting it up on our own 
field—$75.00.
We had our troubles to get the 
field ready for the opening of the 
football season in the fall of 1909, 
but it was finally accomplished. 
The surface of the field, in spite of 
a fair showing of grass, was only 
a few degnccs softer than a con­
crete roadway, for we had no 
money to purchase top soil or sod. 
When t'He crowd marched ii\ on 
opening day, wc all felt very 
proud, for the combined efforts 
of students and faculty had created 
what seemed to' us, and certainly 
was, a most attractive field in a 
natural setting for an amphitheater. 
The spirit shown by the students 
and faculty in carrying this plan 
through to completion was a fine 
example of what the Clan Carnegie 
may do by intelligent mass action; 
and as we look back in memory 
to that period, and reflect upon 
the friendship which grew oijt of 
that close association with a lot 
of fine young men, this thought 
has given a lasting satisfaction to 
one who has always enjoyed his 
contacts with youth.

Silver Anniversary
The fourth part of a century has passed, and we cease 
from our work today, for a few hours, to pay homage to the 
glory of these twenty-five years. The passing of time has 
brought many changes, none of which have been retrogressive, 
and as we try to realize, the magnitude of the progress of 
Carnegie, we wonder'at the futility of attempting to name its 
many phases.
Four colleges of national fame have arisen in less than 
three decades from the small nucleus of a technical school. Alma 
Mater has given her protection to men and women, who after 
leaving the calm and quiescence of her protectorate, have 
brought honor and fame to their professions and theniselves, and 
hence two-fold honor to her. Preparedness, which has been the 
key-note of her guiding influence, seems to us to-be the highest 
gift that a protege may receive.
Go, then, back to your work with reverence and thanks­
giving in your hearts. Realize that the burden of the sub­
sequent years lies, in no smaH way, with you. Do not let this 
burden be-one that arises from a sense of duty; consider it more 
in the light of a privilege that comes to you, hand in hand, with 
the privilege of sharing the glory that is Carnegie’s. And, lastly, 
bow your heads in humility as you think of those.who have 
helped to make possible these, twenty-five years.
The First Editorial
Editor’s Comment: This editorial is reprinted from the first 
edition of the first Tartan.
It -is fitting and proper at this time, when we send forth 
the first issue of the Tartan, that the students be informed of 
our purpose and the things we, the editors,, stand for, as in, any 
venture of this kind the success or failure depends upon the 
attitude and spirit in which it is received by those whom it 
reaches. .The editors do not stand in the position of suppliants; 
they take the stand, rather, of those who are ready to deliver 
the goods./ It is the intention of. the editors to place, before the 
student bod)'- not only those events which have happened but 
newsy items of events to come. We have the patronage of our 
faculty, and hope to draw upon them for an occasional essay, 
which we Have no hesitation in saying will be interesting to all 
the men. Outside talent will also be secured, and the Tartan
will prove its right to the title_^of Official Organ o£v Carnegie
Technical Schools.
DAUNTLESS CARNEGIE 
(Continued from Pace One)
.Urling netted 19 yards for Tech 
and then Kiski held, forcing Tech 
to kick. Kiski caught the ball on 
the Tech 45-yard line and the 
runner was downed almost in his 
tracks by Dowling. By a series of 
line plunges and a cleverlj’- execut­
ed forward pass, 18 yards were 
gained, and at this time Tech’s 
line took a brace and held for 
down. Tech rushed the ball by 
short, consistent gains for 30 yards 
and were then forced to kick. Kiski 
ran the ball in.for 10 yards; Tech 
held; Kiski lcickcd to Tech’s 10- 
yard line, and Tech could not gain 
and was forced to kick. The punt 
was very bad and netted Tech only 
five yards and^ amidst the -cries of 
touchdown from the -side lines, the 
wearers of the blue and white 
started for the goal line. They 
rushed the pigskin by hard line 
plunges up to Tech’s one-yard line, 
and there they struck a stone wall, 
for the wearers of the Tartan were 
game -to the .core. Tech kicked 
oyt, and the Kiski man was down­
ed by Kann without gain. After 
trying the line without success, 
Kumler was sent around end, and 
by a brilliant run made Kiski’^ 
only score. Kiski 6, Tech 0.
The remainder of the first half 
was of little consequence, the ball
remaining practically in the middle 
of the field.
The second half opened with 
Kiski kicking off to T ech. Tech 
rushed the ball for a series of good 
gains, and then lost on downs on 
their own 45-yard 'line. Kiski made 
seven yards and was forced to 
kick. Henderson broke through, 
blocking the kick; Halferty caught 
the pigskin and wras off like a shot 
for the goal line. Wright missed 
an easy goal. Score, • Kiski 6, 
Tech 3. During the remainder of 
the half a kicking game was played 
with the,odds in favor of Kiski.
Kumler’s fine work for Kiski and 
Henderson, Halferty, Bceken and 
Adams’ playing for Tech were the 
features.- Lineup:

From the Fence
Hello Folks!
Being right up to the minute on 
what’s- new and different on the 
campus, this column takes on a 
.hoary atmosphere this week, in keep­
ing with the Anniversary edition of 
your medium. Below will, be found 
cxcrpts from .the preceding "Fences,” 
written by Nancy Newman, who has 
since made good, and Frank Foote, 
who has since made good, or at 
least better, wise-cracks.
From 1929 we have: “For the bene­
fit -of those who arc not- ‘in the 
know’ the blindfolded co-eds that 
one sees being led all over the cam­
pus are not young ladies suffering 
from, chronic headache, but Maggie 
Murph sophomores being initiated in 
their departments. These initiations 
are most disconccrting. Just at the 
season when one is in the prime of 
that sophomoric feeling—no more arm­
bands, plenty of jewelry and legal­
ized male society, she is politely but 
forcibly requested to engage in such 
indignities as doing the Black Bot­
tom for the edification and amuse­
ment of the future instructors, or 
exhibiting the luxuriancy of her new 
crop of long hair, if she is fortunate 
enough to possess .such.”
"Isn’t there something that can be 
done, about, the ventilating system in 
Margaret Morrison? Is it as bad in 
all the other colleges? We hate to 
raise such muflit objections, but it 
seems that there ought to be some 
method of improvement. JVe go 
from one class to the next not 
knozuing zuhclhcr zue' zuill be over­
come by heat or frozen to death. 
Can’t they at least be consistent? 
This putting on and taking off of 
coats is very annoying and certainly 
most unhealthy., It isn't the least bit 
pleasant to be so hot that is an 
effort to keep awake, nor is it any 
more enjoyable iot be so cold that 
one has to write with gloves on.”
Among the memorable sayings of 
Frank Foote, we place: “We shall! 
expect to find physicians and sur­
geons prescribing ‘Three kisses daily, 
one before each meal.’ Just so the 
medicine docs not have to be taken 
water. Sweethearts spooning in 
parks and parked automobiles need 
fear the police no longer. All they 
hav<j t0 produce certificates
from medical advisers advocating 
osculation, especially in cold weather, 
and the 'poor police haven’t a chance.”
"The class of 1933 is now one up 
on their supposed betters of 1932 
when it comes to really breaking 
up banquets. Last week these plcbcs, 
feeling the freedom given them all 
year with little or no enforcement 
of regulation, just about ruined what 
should have been perfectly enjoyable 
evening for the class of ’32. While 
the methods employed were decidedly 
unorthodox and unethical, , the de­
sired effect was gained. And all the 
sophs had to show for their $2.50 
was a leatherette ;comb and file case 
with Sophomores, Januanr, 1929, en­
graved upon it, and leather steaks 
under their belts. Whether that Jan­
uary 1929 engraved upon it, was a 
mistake or not is questionable,' but 
we would hate to suggest that any 
one had been buncoed. Maybe the 
sophomores will snap out of their 
lethargy and make the plcbcs be­
lieve as they should. It’s about time.”
“Just a few weeks now and we’ll 
have the annual manifestation of 
inter-fraternal loves in which one 
fraternity brother sees to it that the 
honorary which he has been serving 
so diligently for the past year has a 
successor in the ranks of the school 
elite. In other words, Call Day will 
soon be- with us. The publications 
officials are busier than the pro­
verbial one-armed paper hanger with 
the itch, as they try to find places 
for the young hopefuls who have 
been filled with the desire to zuear a 
distinguishing bcTnnct. The poor in­
dividuals zulio work hard all year 
are left holding the bag. IVrists arc 
rapidly rounding into condition, and 
professor are zuondering zuhy the 
gentle art of handshaking is no 
lo-nger directed toward them. The 
unfortunates zuho arc in a position 
to choose are wearing heavy shoulder 
pads in order to guard against the 
‘Commercial Engineering’ habit of 
backslapping.”

all the Carnegie co-ed were placed

DEAR OLD TECH
Dear Old Tech,
Carnegie Tcch,
You’re the host of all the schools.
(Old Scotch Refrain)
My earliest recollection of T cch 
was during the war, I believe. My 
family had just moved to Pitts­
burgh, arid I was visiting a boy 
friend in the hinterland of Squirrel 
Hill. It was wild country then, 
covcrcd with dense forests of locust 
trees, filled with vicious gray squir­
rels and cotton-tailed bunnies, and 
with every house separated from 
its neighbor, by a big empty, lot.
I recall traveling up to this region 
from Oakland in a “68." We called 
them “dinkeys" and they were 
dinkeys in every sense of the word. 
They’d go clammering over the 
crooked tracks with their square 
wheels, bouncing and lurching from 
side to side, pitching and tossing 
like a destroyer in a stormy sea.
We oozed up Forbes street, I re­
member. It was raining.
"What's dat?" I asked my friend.
“Oh, that's Carnegie Tech, he 
replied, indicating the dozen or so 
long, unpainted ugly buildings, 
sticking like islands out of six 
inches of mud and slush. "They’re 
barracks,” he announced grandly. 
And that was my first view of the 
Tech Campus.
My next view wiis more awe­
inspiring. I was taking a walk 
through Schcnlcy Park* with my 
father. He pointed over to a flock 
of yellow buildings agdinst the hill­
side, pointed especially to' one tall 
structure.
"See that tower," he said. "That’s 
a. chimney.”
. ;"Gee!" I exclaihied.v' What man­
ner of place could have a chimney 
like that I
There arc other vague memories. 
One of a series of tranches with 
sandbag parapets ’• that , zigzagged 
where the tennis, courts are’ now. 
One of the first Britisli, tanks to 
come to. this country, crawling up 
Flagstaff Hill and then demolishing 
an automobile. One of scared 
peeps into the I-Iall of Architecture
at the nude statues and masses of 
shapeless clay. One of the weird 
cacophony of sound that beat frohi 
the music section.. One of a play 
by Molicre in the open air.
But Tcch became a crystallized I 
reality some years later. My cousin 
was staying with us and lie was a 
Freshman. I remember how I used 
to go down in the car with him, 
how just before Morcwood and 
Forbes he’d surreptitiously drag his 
plcbc cap from his pocket, and put 
his regular cloth cap away. How 
I envied that little plaid overseas 
affair and hoped that someday I 
might wear one!
And there are other rccoll^ctioiih.
I rccall watching the , football 
games, sitting at an unbelievable 
angle on the precipitous bank op­
posite the grandstand and watching 
Tartan teams plunge to victory. I 
rccall that famous 6-0 conquest over 
Pitt, when the whole town, street 
cars, billboards, everything Was 
plastered with the score. 1 rccall 
walking home from Schcnlcy High, 
and the thrill I always used to get 
as I’d stop at Slcibo Inn and' take 
one long drink out of the pipe that 
poured into the rockfillcd barrel.
I remember other things. I re­
member the riots, after the old 
Schenlcy-Pcabody games. I re­
member a track meet, when our 
relay team won the city champion­
ship, and. we contestants had to 
dress under the grandstand, and 
our embarrassment when We saw 
some girls watching us.
Oh, I remember lots of things, 
and I’m glad to be here. , I only 
wonder what things I’ll be remem­
bering of 'dear old Tccl\, Carnegie 
Tcch, fifteen years from now.
