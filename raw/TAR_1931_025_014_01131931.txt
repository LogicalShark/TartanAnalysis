“Two Cheeks To Slap” Opens Tonight In Little Theatre: Play Written by Rev. Dienes of Drama Department
Production By Graduate 
Student Depicts Real 
Life
DRAMA OF MILL LIFE
Characters in Scenes Are 
Drawn From Author’s 
Experiences
The drama of Pittsburgh mill life, 
"Two Cheeks to Slap,” by the Rev. 
Mr. -Barnabas Dienes, will open 
Tuesday night, anuary 13, in the 
Little Theater. Mr. Dienes is a 
graduate student with the! Drama 
Department and is personally di­
recting his play, which was written 
in the dramatic composition class 
of Professor Chester B. Wallace.
"Suppose,” Mr. Dienes says, “a 
man should turn up in Pittsburgh 
who realizes how much misery 
(here is in the world and wants to 
make existence better. He tries to 
love people.” The play tells what 
happens to him, first as a steel 
worker, then as a mill owner. The 
solution of his problem is the last 
scene of the play.
“Two Checks to Slap” is a play 
in two parts, with two scenes in 
cach part. It is being produced, 
however, so that the action of the 
various scenes is uninterrupted. The 
sets are impressionistically painted 
to bring out the dominant idea of 
cach scene. To supplement the 
scenery, sound effects arc being 
used to suggest the ceaseless mo.tion 
of the outside world. Mr. Dienes 
hopes in this way to keep present 
in the mind of the audience the 
,,connection of the little snatches of 
,1 ifc being enacted on the stage with 
./' the things going on outdoors, above 
J and bclo\v, and all about, to «create 
an impression of distant symphony 
„.of Wc.
The lighting is used to help this 
mood. The author is producing the 
play in such a manner as to give 
a definite impression of real life, 
real people, their emotions, and 
sorrows, yet his technique will not 
bear the name of realistic, Mr. 
Dienes wants to make the audience 
feel the super-reality of life, the 
real emotions of the character. The 
individual will appreciate the play 
in the same degree as the different 
phases of life depicted affcct him. 
There is notliing tricky about the 
play, nothing imaginative. Mr. 
Dienes says, “A play should talk 
for itself.” “Two Checks to Slap,” 
is based on Mr. Dienes own phil­
osophy of life, a tragedy in comic 
form. The characters arc drawn 
from the author’s experiences, as 
arc all the ones which he portrays.
Those who have parts in the play 
arc Leo Daschbach, Burtt McKee, 
Pauline Baucrsmith, Gcongc Koun.tz, 
Clayton Thompson, Raymond Ncy- 
liart, Frank Mason, George I-Icldc- 
brand, Clancy Cooper, John Ackcn- 
hcad, Robert Gill, AnnabJle Kemp-

Clarence Darrow 
Will Return To 
City For Debate
Rev. MacGowan to Take 
Positive Side of 
Question
Clarence Darrow, celebrated crimi­
nal lawyer, is returning to Pitts­
burgh, Thursday, January 15, for 
a public debate at Carnegie Music 
Hall. He will take the negative
¦ of the subject, ‘‘Is Religion Nec- 
essarjr?” Rev. Dr. Robert [Mac­
Gowan, of Bellefield Presbyterian 
Church, Pittsburgh, will be the af­
firmative debater. *
Opening the discussion with a 
25-minute statement, Dr. MacGow­
an also will have a 25-minute re­
buttal and a 10-minute sur-rebut- 
tal. Mr. Darrow will speak for 35 
minutes, following Dr. MacGow- 
an’s opening address, and again for

carccr as a criminal lawyer. As a 
speaker he is said to be the great­
est individual drawing card on the 
American platform. He is known 
best' for his defense of Loeb and 
Leopold, Chicago’s juvenile thrill 
killers, for the Scopes evolution 
trial in Dayton, Tenn., and for the

Recommendations 
Bureau Advises 
Gov’t. Positions
Seniors Should Turn in 
Information Blanks 
Before Jan. 14
The Bureau of Recommendations 
expects the placement of 1931 grad­
uates to be aiTcctcd by the pres­
ent business depression. It is 
therefore necessary to make sure 
that no opportunities for employ­
ment are overlooked.
There are numerous opportuni­
ties in government service which 
provides the graduate with experi­
ence equally as valuable as that 
received in the training course of 
many industrial concerns. The civil 
service examinations for Junior 
Engineers arc held in February 
and March, and applications must 
be filed with the Civil Service,Com­
mission 110 later than February 10, 
1931. The schedule of examina­
tions has been posted on the vari­
ous bulletin boards, and while tak­
ing this examination docs not 
obligate the student to accept a 
post, it does make him eligible fcfr 
an opening in his field«
Fellowships and graduate schol­
arships are offered by various 
schools throughout the country, 
through which the student may
pursue further his choscn braiich 
of “'study. Notices of such fellow­
ships may be secured from Mr. 
Grau, who will again be in cliargc 
of senior placement. Mr. Bright 
has agreed to furnish Mr. Grau 
with transcripts of the college rec­
ords of seniors interested in ap­
plying for graduate fellowships.
Seniors who have not already
turned in their -Senior Information 
blanks, arc urged to do so before 
January 14, so that these may be 
blue-printed soon.
The Bureau believes that with 
the whole-hearted co-operation of 
the seniors and the faculty, all the
graduates will be satisfactorily
placcd by June.
Air. M. M. Boring, of the Gen­
eral Electric Company, Schenec­
tady, New York, will be at Car­
negie Tccli January 22, 23 and 24 
to interview seniors who are in­
terested in working for this com­
pany. Interviews may be arrang-

SCORE DECISIVE WIN 
OVER THIEL CAGERS
Lutherans Unable to Check 
Tartans After Opening 
Minutes of Play
By far the best looking basket­
ball team to represent Carnegie in 
recent years demonstrated their 
ability before a record -ro—d last 
Saturday in the gym when they 
took the Thiel team into camp by 
the decisive count of 49-18.
The Hogan quintette bore but 
slight resemblance of the old get- 
thc-ball and shot combinations for 
which the school has been noted in 
the past. They handled the ball 
splendidly, pass. I accurc':ely, shot
II, and in general experienced 
very little trouble in penetrating the 
Lutheran’s defense. The Tartans 
also exhibited some first class foul 
shooting, making good on 15 of 
their 19 charity t! rows. This ability 
to make good on their opponent’s 
misplays should be a big asset to 
8hc boys in future encounters where 
•the going is tougher than it was 
last Saturday.
The Plaid passers started slowly, 
obviously trying to feel out their 
opponents. uring this interval, 
the Thiel lads made good four free 
throws and sunk three of the five 
baskets tli'sy were able to register 
during the evening. The Scots 
then pulled away without apparent 
effort, never to be threatened for 
the remainder of the-evening.
It was about this stage of the 
game that ^tlic crowd was treated 
to a new thrill. With the score 
13-10 in favor of the local outfit, 
Stcntz started to hold t ^ ball in 
the back court in the hopes, of 
drawing the Theil defense out. 
The Lutherans, however, had been 
coached to wait for their men to 
come to them, which the:' did for 
a full three minutes while Captain 
Ncase held up the basket at the 
other end of the floor and tlu team 
as a whole took a vacation. Final­
ly the "Bantam Austin,” Jimmy 
Leonard, tired of standing still, 
borrowed* the ball from Stcntz and 
proceeded to give an exhibition of 
plain and .‘ancy dribbling in the 
back court, eventually entrusting 
the ball to Fergus. Finally the be- 
sccchings of tli crowd took effect 
and the boys started to make things 
hum ir. earnest with the result of 
a 23-11 margin at the end of the 
half.
The second half was a romp for 
the Hogan coached outfit. They 
found little difficulty in getting 
started and ran the score to 33-11 
before the Thiel outfit knew the 
gi.mc had resumed, 'j'he fact that 
Carnegie used an entirely .icw team 
for a considerable portion of the 
second half only enabled the visi-

ENGINEERS’ SOCIETY 
WILL MEET JAN. 19
"The Manufacture of Glass” will 
be described by speakers at a joint 
meeting of the Engineers’ Society 
of Western Pennsylvania, together 
with the Pittsburgh Chapter of the 
Illuminating Engineering Society, 
to be held in the Blue Room ot 
the William Penn Hotel on Mon­
day evening, January 19, at 8 p. m. 
Mr. E. J. Casselman, holder of the 
Glass Refractory Fellowship at the 
Mellon Institute, will discuss the 
manufacture of window glass. A 
motion picture film showing vari­
ous processes from the mining of 
sand through manual and automa­
tic machine production of glass­
ware, including glass table ware, 
lighting glassware, etc., will be 
presented with explanatory talk by 
Mr. C. A. Stone of the Research 
Department of the Macbeth-Evans 
Glass Company, of Charleroi, Pa.
Paintings, Bead work, and Rugs Feature In 
Exhibit of Mexican Handiwork at Gallery
We felt very small and inexperi­
enced as we stepped into the Car­
negie art gallery, which had taken 
on a truly Mexican atmosphere 
since the International. It was the 
opening of the gxhibition of Mexi­
can arts and handicrafts, initiated 
by Dwight Morrow, arid all the 
people in the up’n up were there. 
The walls were hung with light 
hangings to emphasize the brilliant 
colors, and clusters of palms were 
in the corridor. There arc about 
500 pieces in the collection, repre­
senting the cultural life of our 
southern neighbor in all its aspects, 
and these 500 pieces form about 25 
groups.
The prize of the whole exhibi­
tion, as far as we were concerned, 
was a mask of turquoise alabaster 
with world-weary eyes of gold 
looking out with superb disdain 
upon a curibus collection of straw 
elephants whose trunks were glee­
fully raised to high heaven. An­
other collection of straw proved 
especially interesting—that repre­
senting the typical Mexican village. 
There was a truck, an "escuela,” a 
narrow house with slits c*f win­
dows, two representative statues of 
national heroes that might grace 
the central square of any pctita 
villa, and a steamboat of doubtful 
proportions (for the artist had 
heard about, but had never seen 
any.).
Going to the corner devoted to 
beaded work, we found there some 
exquisite workmanship and lovely 
floral patterns. Their range of ar­
ticles is not limited, and their lit­
tle case for “Luckies” is just as 
perfectly made as the small pocket- 
book that was evincing so much 
admiration. Many religious scenes 
;irc depicted in their bcadwork, 
that is done with faithful adher­
ence to tradition and quaint Span­
ish notations. Besides these mani­
festations of peace and culture 
stand two silver swords, blood­
stained from ancient family feuds, 
one of which bore the sage motto, 
“Where there is vanity there is 
envy.”
Hanging all about the walls were 
long woven rugs which would 
make excellent bath mats, so softly 
luxurious are they! In the middle

Dance to be Held 
After V/.&J. Game
Following the Carnegie Tcch-W. 
and J. basketball game Saturday 
night, January 17, there will be 
a dance in the Union in honor 
of the basketball squad. As usual, 
the varsity, the freshman team, 
and the managers will be admit­
ted without charge. Dancing will 
be $1.25 per couple. The Vene­
tian Screnaders will supply the 
music.
The basketball game starts at 
8 o’clock and is usually over 
about 9:30, so there will be 
ample time for dancing.
These basketball dances arc an 
innovation upon the Carnegie Tech 
campus. Present plans call for 
these dances following all of the 
home games plaj'fd on Saturday 
night.
These danccs will be of the 
same order as the football danccs 
which have been so popular with 
the Carnegie students.
Sophomore Class 
To Hold Banquet
Class of ’32 Set Precedent 
in Publishing News of 
Secret Event
The annual Soph banquet, the 
second of the two functions spon­
sored by the Class of 1933, has 
been scheduled for the, near future 
and final arrangements arc now 
being made.
This gay and festive occasion 
has always been a grand reunion 
for the members of the sophomore 
class and this year’s event is to 
be no exception to the rule. Each 
and ever}' second year man is 
urged to attend. The price will be 
$2 .per plate.
For the benefit of the freshmen 
it might be well to explain that 
the sophomore and freshmen ban­
quets have become traditions, at 
Carnegie. A great deal of tradi­
tion and .history surround these 
two affairs, and they have always 
been scenes of rivalry between 
these two warring factions.
The sophomores generally stage 
their affair- first and the freshmen 
do their best to break it up. Then, 
when the plcbes hold theirs,. the- 
second year men attempt to make 
it unsuccessful. At cach of the 
banquets the attendance of the 
presidents of the opposing class 
has usually been madd compulsory. 
In fact many times these class 
leaders have even been kidnaped.
As a general rule, these class 
functions have been shrouded with 
an air of secrecy and mystery. 
This 'year, however, the sopho­
mores are shattering' these age-old 
traditions and are making all ex­
cept the exact date and place of 
the banquet public. These two 
essential facts arc known only to 
the members of the committee.
Edward Lewis, chairman of the 
banquet, wishes to announce that 
tickets may be purchased from any 
of the following men: Charlie
Schatvet, Joe Bronson, Gene Buck- 
walter, Tom Coulter, Ernie Heider- 
bach, Harry Howcr, Hook Sample, 
Tony Schmidt and Edward Stentz.
PROF. BEGGS TO GIVE 
SECOND TALK TONIGHT
Professor George E. Beggs, an 
authority on bridge construction, 
will deliver the second of two lec­
tures at 8:30 in the Carnegie Union 
tonight. The lecture is on the 
subject, “The Solution of Statical­
ly Indeterminate Structures 8y 
Models” and will be of interest 
not only to students in civil engi­
neering but to all interested in 
problems of modern design and 
construction.
Professor Beggs will use lantern 
slides and models to illustrate his 
lecture, and several Pittsburgh en­
gineers w*ll take part in the dis­
cussion which will follow his talk. 
The first lecture, on Monday night, 
was attended by a large group who 
were almost as enthusiastic about 
the discussion which followed the 
lecture as about the lecture itself. 
The lecture will include a discus­
sion of the deformeter method, 
employing unloaded celluloid mod­
els, for the solution of problems 
in indeterminate structure, includ­
ing continuous beams, frames, 
trusses and archcs.
Rrofcssor Beggs ' is professor of 
civil engineering at Princeton Uni 
vcrsity, and has been a member 
of the department since 1914. He 
is the inventor of a method of de­
termining stresses in structures, 
and the author of "Live Load 
Stresses in Railway Bridges,” be­
sides many" papers appearing in 
technical journals. He is a mem­
ber of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers, American Institute 
of Construction Engineers, Ameri 
can Society for Testing Materials, 
and the American Concrete Insti 
tute.
MEXICAN FINE ARTS 
EXHIBITION NOW AT 
CAÉEGIE INSTITUTE
Examples of Native Art 
Are on Display at 
the Exhibit
The Exhibition of Mexican Arts 
opened Thursday, January 8, at the 
Carnegie Institute. Many interest­
ing objects of Mexican fine and 
applied arts are represented in the 
show. The Exhibition, which was 
initiated by former Ambassador to 
Mexico, Dwight W. Morrow, was 
collccted and assembled last year 
by Homer Saint-Gaudens, Director 
of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute. 
Count Rene d’Harnoncourtv a 
member of a distinguished Austri­
an family, was recommended by 
Ambassador Morrow to assist Mr. 
Saint-Gaudens in assembling the 
Exhibition. The Exhibition is be­
ing financed by the Carnegie Cor­
poration of . New York and is tour­
ing thc^ United States under the 
auspices of the American Federa­
tion of Arts.
Count d’Harnoncourt, who is now 
in charge of the Exhibition while 
it is in this country, has made an 
extensive study of all the arts of 
Mexico and has been particularly 
carcful to select only those exam­
ples of art which are representa­
tive of the native Mexican, crafts­
men..
The Exhibition attempts to or­
ganize the achievements'' of Mexi­
can art today, and to show some 
of the : contributions which antici­
pated and helped to produce'it. It 
contains examples of both early, 
and .modern fine and applied arts, 
representing in the former case the 
unconscious and in the latter the 
conscious expression of the natioal 
characteristics of that country.
Until 1910, Mexican art was 
practically unknown by other coun­
tries. It is only within the last 
twenty years that Mexico has been 
accredited as the possessor of a 
new and individual culturc. Since 
then there has been a Mexican 
Kcnnaisance. in painting. Mexican 
artists were given space in govern­
ment buildings for frescoes that 
have since acquired international 
fame. ¦ . ,

SECOND PAYMENT DUE 
FOR PROM TICKETS
Women Will Choose Orches­
tra For Junior Prom In 
Near Future
The second sale of tickets for 
the Women’s Junior Prom will be 
held in Margaret Morrison and 
Arts School every day this week. 
Elizabeth Cannon will have charge 
of the ticket sale in Arts School, 
in front of Dean Iveebcl's office, 
'from 11:30 to 1:30, and Janet Mc­
Clelland will be stationed in the 
front hall of Margaret Morrison 
at the same time each day. The 
dues for the second installment is 
$5. The final sale will be held 
for two weeks preceding the Prom 
date, March 20, and during this’ 
time the balance of $4.50 must be 
paid. All girls who do not attend 
the Prom will be assessed $5.
Betty Phillips has taken Eleanor 
Cooke’s place as a member of the 
Prom committee. She will take 
charge of the programs. All girls 
who are eligible to attend this 
annual affair are urged to notify 
the committee as soon as possible. 
The favors will be ordered within 
two weeks, so- those who have not 
signed up must do it soon.
The selection of the orchestra 
for the Women’s Junior Prom has 
been progressing rapidly, and just; 
now the committee is considering 
the orchestras of Emerson Gill 
and Lloyd Hunter. Both are popu­
lar collegiate dance orchestras, and 
it is probable that a choice will be 
made between these two.
Automotive Society Will 
Hold Meeting Here Jan. 25
On January 15 at 6:30 p. m., the 
Society of Automotive Engineers 
will hold a dinner in the Carnegie 
Commons. The price is $1.75.
This will be followed by short 
talks and demonstrations in the 
automotive laboratories of Carnegie 
on the subject of brakes. The 
speakers will include: Steve John­
son of the Bcndix Works of the 
Westinghor.se Company, who will 
speak on "Airbrakes”; A. C. Bowen 
of the Lockheed \Vorks and J. R. 
Rose of the Wagner Electric Com­
pany, on “Hydraulics”; M. M. Cun­
ningham of the Bendix Works of 
the Westinghouse Company, 
"Mechanicals,” and R. P. Breese of 
Bragg-Kliesrath, on “Boosters.’ 
Prof. J. W. Trimmer will be the 
meeting chairman.
The meeting is being held at 
Carnegie in order that the society 
may become acquainted with the 
Automotive Educational Facilities 
which are a feature of the school.

Outpost of Appleselling Host Encamped
Under Portals of Maggie Murph Hideout
We’ve often wondered why the 
apple sellers didn’t invade t lie 
campus sooner, for if Skibo’s sales 
are any indication, . the Maggie 
Murp'hs know their Pippins ’ and 
their Jonathons. By some curious 
whimsy of fate, one appeared at 
the Morcwood avenue • entrance 
the Very first day of Christmas va­
cation—just twenty-four hours too 
late for the main stream of traffic'. 
But when the new year started we 
found a vender stationed in the 
arena of women’s perogatives, a 
vender whose wares arc bright ^nd 
red and shiny from much spit and 
polishing, and whose delightful in­
sides may be had for a nickel.
The market for apples is. a 
fluctuating one, he tells us, as 
varied and uncertain as the weather, 
and just as interesting to speculate 
upon. The most popular time of 
day for buying apples seems to 
be between the hours of 2 and 4, 
when hungry Maggie Murphs rush 
out for- sustenance and pay a 
nickel for it. Of course the rosiest 
apples are in demand, and though 
the pink paper partially hides the
few blemishes that appear, he has 
to exercise his native strategy to 
sell the remaining green ones. But 
that difficulty has settled itself, for 
no . sooner had they been about 
this arena than they began blush­
ing, and so often did they blush 
that the hue became a permanent 
one. *
The propensity for apples is an 
old one, dating back to the time 
when Eve succumbed to their lure, 
and the demand for them still con­
tinues. Present day economic con­
ditions,' however, have necessitated 
a change in the old slogan “An 
apple p. day keeps the doctor 
away” to “A Pippin a day keeps 
the wolf away.” Besides aiding the 
unemployed, your nickel helps the 
business men, .and gets rid of the 
surplus of apples more effectively 
than any other kind of advertising 
could:
And for the way seeds arc being 
spit out right and* left, the number 
of young saplings on the Cut 
should be considerably augmented
“Y” Will Organize 
Plebe Cabinet At 
Meeting Today
Discussion Will Be Held 
on Spring Church and 
“Y” Meeting
A Freshman "Y” Cabinet will be 
organized this noSn at the Y. M. 
C. A. Cabinet meeting in, the Wom­
en’s Dining Room. Recommenda­
tions for. the .yeacling, .organization, 
will be made by the cabinet mem­
ber. Th,e cabinet will consist of 
twelve freshmen who are interested 
or who haVe shown an interest in 
Y. M. C.. A. work on the campus 
this year or have belonged to 
“Hi-Y” c rganizations in high school.
The Freshman Cabinet first be­
came a campus organization last 
year. Because of the aid the 
cabinet gave to the General Student 
Cabinet Committees in performing 
the many campus functions of the 
“Y”, it was decidcd that the Fresh­
men Cabinet should become a per­
manent organization. Each member 
of the cabinet is placed on a sub­
committee of the general cabinet so 
that he may become acquainted 
with tlic procedures followed by the 
committees. The Freshman Cabinet 
is. organized' rn the same manner 
that the 'general cabinet is. Be­
side being on the general cabinet 
sub-committee, each member serves 
on a committee which functions 
through the Freshman organization.
- Rev. Robert Steele of- the Shady- 
side Presbyterian Church will repre­
sent the churches of the near prox­
imity at the meeting. Rev. Steele 
will discuss the problem of co­
operation between the churches and 
the “Y’s”, with the cabinet. The 
churches are enthusiastic support­
ers of all the “Y” activities, both 
spiritually and financially. In. turn 
the "Y’s” co-operate with the, 
churches * in securing connections 
for freshmen when they irst arrive 
on the camp«;.
Plans will be laid at the meeting 
for a joint meeting to be held 
March 13th among the Y. W. and 
Y. M. Cabinets. Two prominent 
educators and speakers of tha coun­
try have been invited to address 
the group. According to members 
of the program committee, this 
meeting should be one of the most 
interesting meetings that has been 
hel l this year.
The delegate to the National 
Student-Faculty “Y” Convention at 
Detroit, Michigan during the Christ­
mas holidays will give his report. 
This convention is held every four 
years for the purpose of consider­
ing and discussing administrative, 
social, athletic, non-athletic activity, 
and religious problems on the

Signor Giovanni Romagnoli,' an 
outstanding painter of modern 
Italy, has been secured by the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
to conduct a class for advanced 
students in painting as a part of 
the work of . the department of 
Painting and Decoration in the 
night school.
The first meeting of tlie class 
was held last night with the visit­
ing professor in charge. Only stu­
dents with advanced standing were 
admitted. The group will meet on 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and 
Friday evenings from' 7:30 to 10 
o’clock with Signor Romagnoli in 
charge two evenings of each week. 
The class is scheduled to meet un­
til the close of night school Tn 
May.
Signor Romagnoli is well known 
to Pittsburgh art lovers through 
his pictures which have been ex­
hibited at the International, and he 
is not unknown as a teacher, since

It is composed of twelve pieces and 
plays music which corresponds to 
the Don Bcstcr style. This orchestra, 
although little known in this^district, 
is regarded by many pcopl^ in the 
East as superior to Duke Ellington 
and his Cotton Club Band or Mc- 
Kcnny’s Cotton Pickers.
Jan Garber, well known orchestra 
leader, claims that this is the best 
colored orchestra in the country. 
Paul Spccht also of National orchcs- f 
tral fame, says that he has never 
heard its equal in a colored band.
The tickets for the Prom arc 
$7.50 complete. The sale, however, is 
divided in order to make the pur­
chase of the tickets easier. The first 
ticket sale ends this week and the 
sccond and final sale begins the week 
of January 27. The preliminary ticket 
costs $4, and the final assessment 
will be $3.50. There will be no ad­

superior in quality to the normal 
dance favor.
Regarding decoration of the ball-­
room.
A ycry novel lighting effect- has 
been arranged in which different col­
ored lights will shine through a 
grating, above the dance floor. 
Further effects in color will be,

One of the professors of the 
printing department has designed 
the very unusual programs.
Dancing will begin at 9:00 o’clock 
and will continue until 2. A buffet

next November.
In an address to the OP Industry

“We are uncertain,” he said, 
“whether the thousands of processes 
now being worked out^by scien­
tists for the treatment of coal can 
cure the industry, but certainly 
science is doing something.”

PAGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1931.
ALUMNI NEWS
N COMPARISON WITH RECENT YEARS, Carnegie’s present basketball season is already 
a success. Having taken four out of five en­
counters thus far, the Plaids have bettered last year’s victory record by one win, and the 
season is still young.
Had the Tartans allowed the Lutherans fewer 
foul shots, the score would have been even 
more lop-sided. However, our boys gave an even better exhibition of foul shooting Toy sink­ing 15 of their nineteen free throws.
* * * * *
WHEN THE PLAID FLOORMEN ARRIVED IN 
CLEVELAND FROM BUFFALO, the first thing they did was to scramble for ,the well known sports sheet to see how 
badly they had been beaten. "Red" Fergus won and opened the paper only to see a half page'cut of “Red” Fergus staring 
at him. He was revived in time for the gjimc.
* * * *
THE PLEBE CAGER’S DEBUT proved to be a revelation 
to those who looked on with a critical eye. “Brad” Edleblut (pronpjmced Edleblut) was consistent in getting the tip-off 
which’ resulted in the team’s working a systematic offense. 
Jagnaw, regularly at forward, but who turned guard for part 
of the opener, cleverly rescued the ball from the JohnstownJuniors on several occasions and guarded well. ...Frecdlc starred
in finding the basket on . long range shots, and Stewart and 
Silverman worked well in the systematic plays.
*****
THE' APPEARANCE OF THE KILTY BAND at the game added its touch of zest to the evenings entertainment. 
With the team going like it is, and the student body following 
it:, “Buddy” Ovcrcnd should take great pleasure in erecting additional bleachers.

HE INAUGURATION OF BOXING as an official Tartan sport, and the first showing of 
blackened eyes and eccentric snoots will take 
place at Morgantown, West Virginia, Thurs­
day evening. Coach “Ernie” S.csto, himself an Olympic champion, has rounded his proteges 
into condition for their first entanglement, while “Bill” Tauricllo has been taking care of the 
alcohol for rubdowns. “Eddie” (Bad Boy) 
Ashe will open, entering the ring in the 125
pound class. Affetranger will care' for the 135class, Carr and Restaine for the 145 pounders, Scrvel for the160’s, and “Duke” Ducanis will enter in the 175 class.* * * * *

competitive work-out; in [the pool , Friday when tliey will take on the Downtown Y. M. C, A. in a practice meet.
Little is known of the strength of this year’s outfit, so 
that Friday’s meet should afford a good opportunity to determine 
what is in store for. Plaid mermen and their chances during the coming season.
Plebe Basketeers 
Open By Downing 
Junior Pitties
Floor General
Strength of Squad Re­
vealed As Yearlings 
Maintain Early Lead
The Plcbc cagcrs opened their 
season, and the eyes of the spec­
tators in the Skibo gym Saturday 
night by defeating the Pitt Johns­
town Junior aggregation 49-37. 
Although the defense of the yearl­
ing team was ragged at times, 
there was evidence of a well-round­
ed combination in the making 
which will polish with time and 
experience. For an entirely new 
combination, however, playing its 
first collegiate ball and learning a 
new system, the Plebcs looked 
well fortified for their schedule. A 
part of the weakness, too, can 
properly be laid to the absence 
from the line-up of Raudabaugh, a 
power on the defense. .
"Freddy” Frecdlc and "Louie” 
Jagnaw were the high scorers of 
the game, Frccdle finding the 
bucket for Seven field goals and 
Jagnaw for five. The contest was 
marked by consistent fouling by 
both teams, the Juniors emerging 
with fourteen of their twenty points 
in the ‘ first half credited to foul 
shots. Towards the end of the 
game, three of the regulars on the 
Tartan team were sent to the 
showers via. the personal foul 
route. Taking advantage of this, 
the young Pittites staged a rally 
and elevated their score from 20 to 
37 points before the gun cracked.
Saturday’s exhibition being the 
first round of the season’s con­
tests explains the why of the ner­
vousness at the opening. "Brad" 
("Slanky" to his personal friends) 
Edelblut got the tip-off consistent­
ly, and thus placed the Plebcs in 
a position to cxccutc their plays.
Jagnaw, regularly at forward, but 
who was in a guard’s shoes for 
the opener, hails from Jackson, 
Michigan. "Louie" figured promi­
nently in |.he Chicago Scholastic 
»Series. "Red” Silverman and "Fred­
die" Frecdlc arc local talent, hav­
ing played with teams from this 
vicinity in beginning their careers. 
Edelblut, the lanky center, hails 
from Washington, D.C., where he 
played Jiigh school ball. Jack 
Raudabaugh, who left an enviable 
record back home, will soon be on 
deck to show his prowess for the 
young Skibos. Jack is ffoni To­
ledo, Ohio. Another , promising 
candidate, one "Bill" Stewart, 
showed his creditable style by ac­
counting for two field goals. -
CAPTAIN GEORGE-NEASE, who 
is serving his second year as Tar­
tan floor general. Thus far, Ncasc 
has an average of better than nine 
points to the game.

Riflers Open Saturday; 
_ResuIts Of Competitive 
Matches Disappointing
With the competitive matches 
over, the rifle, tc'ahi.is now look­
ing forward to the opening of the 
season this Saturday. Manager 
Beamer has booked four strong 
colleges for this event from differ­
ent sections of the country: Johns 
Hopkins, North Carolina State, 
Georgetown, Rose Polytechnic In­
stitute. This will be of the. cus­
tomary telegraphic variety, the re­
sults to be wired to the different 
schools participating.
Scores in the competitive shoot 
were disappointing to be sure, but 
as the team has had but little prac­
tice this year, these scores cannot 
be considered representative. Bcck- 
crt and Btisc led the field with 368, 
followed closely by G enter and 
Schcrba with 364 and by Hopkins 
with 350. The total for the first 
five was 1814, fifteen points lower 
than any score shot last year.
Included in this year’s schedule 
are shoulder-to-shouldcr meets with 
Pitt, Penn State, and the Navy, the 
first two to be shot in Pittsburgh, 
and the Navy meet to take plac'd' 
at Annapolis.
Those who have not as yet shot 
in the competitive matches arc re­
quested to do so as soon as pos­
sible.
For the first game of the year, 
"Buck” Buckley, who is caring for 
the Plebcs while Coach Hogan 
concentrates 011 the .Varsity, pre­
sented a team which, with •tim'd' 
and experience, should mould into 
excellent Varsity material for next 
year.

Practice Swimming 
Meet To Be Held In 
Gymnasium Friday
Little has been said, but much 
has been done in preparation for 
Carnegie’s plunge into the swim­
ming lanes of 1931. Both Varsity 
and Plcbc squads have absorbed 
their pre-season training with hope­
ful results, to say nothing of their 
appetite for the 17 meets coming 
their way in February and March. 
Coach Riscdorph has left no drop 
of water unturned in an effort to 
bring his charges into perfect con­
dition. With additional practice 
sessions, the tankmen will use the 
remaining few weeks to polish 
the rough spots and to take on the 
finishing touches.
A swimming aggregation from 
the downtown Y. M. C. A. will visit 
the Plaid pool on Friday at 5:30 
for a practice meet with the Var­
sity. This will be the first ex­
hibition of the Tartan natators and 
tjic gates will be 'open to any who 
are interested in the water sport.

CARNEGIE CLUB HOLDS 
ORGANIZATION MEETING
The. Carnegie Tcch Club is ad­
vancing rapidly and living ijp to all 
expectations. The raemb'efsliip ' has 
now increased to one hufidred and 
ten loyal Carncgians, and th'ere are 
high hopes for obtaining many more 
new members now that the holiday 
season has passed o^er and the first 
of a new year has 'presented itself. 
The Membership Campaign now in 
progress has so far proven success­
ful, and even greater results are 
anticipated during the ensuing months.
On Thursday, January 8, the ciub 
had its first regular meeting for the 
purpose of organization. -The meet­
ing was conducted by Mr. Howard 
Bowman, the Temporary Chairman; 
and at that time it was announced 
that the Charter of the Club had 
been granted by the Common Pleas 
Court, Wednesday morning, January 
7, 1931.
The following ten Directors of the 
Club were elected by those'members 
present: Messrs. John h/ Porter 
Clarence Ovcrcnd, Howard Bowman, 
F. R. Cogswell, Clifford B. Connelley, 
John F. Laboon, G. Lloyd Comfort,- 
W. L. Sprenglc, Donald Dalton and 
T. H. Ross.
It was also decided at the meet­
ing that the Pittsburgh Clan be dis­
solved in that it had been super­
seded by the Carnegie Tcch Club 
of Pittsburgh.
Since the two Open House parties 
.held by the Club on Dccembcr 13 
and December 20 turned out so suc­
cessfully, and so much enjoyment 
was shared by those present, the 
Club considers it a privilege to ex­

These Timken Bearings 
Have Run 70 Times the Life of 
the Average Automobile
The pinion bearings in the 6 Westinghbuse-Nuttall gear re­
duction units at the Washington Pulp and Paper Company 
have each rolled up the enormous total of over 2,338,000,000 
revolutions, and a recent check-up shows that they are good 
for many millions more.
Loaded 100% of their Timken catalogue rating, they have 
averaged 6'/( days per week, 24 hours a day since they were 
installed in April, 1923.
The total distance traveled by each of these bearings is the 
equivalent of driving an automobile more than 3,500,000 
miles, whereas the average automobile travels but 50,000 
miles during its entire life.
A worthy tribute to Timken stamina! Won’t you want this 
same unequalled endurance in the machinery you design, 
recommend or buy? The Timken Roller Bearing Com­

A SECTION OF THE TARTAN 
DEVOTED TO THE 
NIGHT STUDENTS.Uhe Carnegie fMaiò
EXCHANGE NUMBER OF 
PUPPET OUT THIS 
WEEK.
>Vcll, here we arc back again on 
the Campus. That Christmas vaca­
tion' certainly did not last very 
long, nor was it furious in my case. 
I did, however, map out a very 
elaborate (that is a fifty dollar 
word) program wherewith I would 
catch up with all my back studies 
and the success of this scheme, sad 
to relate, isn’t. How could you ex­
pect me to attend to all the social 
calls, even if I didn’t want to, but 
I did, if I had to look after my 
class assignments? It is a hard 
life a night student has to live any 
where, and at Carnegie it is so 
much harder that I don’t see why 
ive register year after year. Some 
day, maybe, there won’t be any 
night students; they will have 
either decided the racket isn’t worth 
the effort or they will secure their 
education by some new method, 
television, or some such scheme. 
Then watch the teaching profession 
take notice. There will be no vic­
tims of their wrath—R’s and F’s 
and I’s, etc. This brings me to 
another subject.
Semester Exams. They are just 
upon us now,, and if you don’t be­
lieve me, just look in your hand­
book—page 82 to be exact—and you 
will find the sad hews. How am I 
going to weather the storm? I 
don’t know. If back eight assign­
ments in one subject and four in 
another means anything, I guess I 
will draw a flunk. But I have a 
week or so to redeem (another high 
priced word) myself, and I will 
cease to be an Idle Night Student 
and get to work for once and see 
if I can’t make the grade. If I 
don’t I guess I will join the "Wish 
I Had Club.” You don’t know what 
this is, well I’ll let you in on the 
secret. It’s a ne\v secret society 
being formed by some others and 
myself and every time we fail to 
(do something, or take, advantage of 
‘a good situation, opportunity, or in 
other words acting in the ,opportune 
time, you just say "Wish I had” 
thus and so. Yes we have a great 
number "of candidates for'. (he 'or­
ganization out here on the Campus 
and' they don’t need to be pledged 
to vljccomc members, they already 
have the password. They watch 
the other, fellow do the work, that 
includes me, and then when it is
Post-Holiday Dance 
Postponed Until January 24
The Post-Holiday Dame of the 
Night Student Council which was 
schcduhd to be held on January 10 
has been postponed until Jarmary 
24.
It was impossible to get this 
news to the night students soonér 
because the final arrangements 
which determined the date could 
not be definitely made until school 
convened. It was also impossible 
to print the notice df the postpone­
ment in the Tartain because there 
was no issue of the paper during 
the Christmas recess.
Tickets have been distributed to 
all the workers, and they are urged 
to make this dance a success. The 
workers áre also expected to be on 
hand to help put the auditorium in 
condition for the dance. The Gym­
nasium has been secured for the 
affair, and work on decorations will 
start at four o’clock in the after­
noon.
The Plaid regrets that there 
should be a postponement of the 
scheduled dance, but1 conditions be­
yond our control, has necessitated 
the change. Full details of the 
dance will be published in the next 
issue of the Tartan.
done, they draw in their chest and 
say "Wish I had.”
See by the (you’re wrong) it 
isn’t the papers this time, but the 
bulletin boards that the Post-Holi­
day Dance has beejt “Postponed” 
for another couple of weeks. Now 
isn’t that nice. Just when you ex­
pect to enjoy a long needed rest 
something comes along to.take the 
joy out of life and they don’t have 
the (dancc. It says that particulars 
are in the Tartan, so I will look 
it up. Here I was all set to go 
and then the works arc all wrecked. 
But they won’t stop me. I’ll be 
there whenever they have, ii so 
they won’t fool me, because these 
dances are something to look for­
ward to and how. I know; I have 
been to the other dances which the 
N. S. C. (translated means Night 
Student Council) hold and they 
^fon’t .fool. Sec you there whenever 
it is.
By the way, if you don’t know it 
and think so, the last issue of the 
Plaid was certainly a very fine 
issue. It was the best I have seen 
in a long time, and I am glad that 
they think enough of this column 
to insert , the "contribs” from time 
to time.
He was staking his future 
on those castings
Even though it was July 4 and a 
holiday, R. T. Crane, then a young 
man, was so eager to see his tiny new 
foundry in actual operation that he 
lighted the furnace, filled the crucible 
with metal, and poured His first cast­
ings. When the moulds were cool, 
and the first Crane products ready, 
he studied and cleaned and polished 
with inexhaustible care.
The little foundry has grown into the 
347 acres of Crane manufacturing 
plants. Progress has brought rows 
of giant electric furnaces to take the 
place of his first crude one. The light­
ning rod couplings that he made on 
that day in 18 5 j have been expanded 
into a line of 33,000 items, meeting 
every modern valve and fitting need 
of the world’s industries. But to this 
day, the example the founder set of 
intense personal interest and pride 
and care for the quality of each prod­
uct remains a distinguishing mark 
of the Crane organization.
Just as the founder on that first day 
felt that his future rested with the 
quality of those couplings, Crane men 
are trained to feel that their company’s 
reputation rests upon the quality of 
each valve and fitting they turn out.

NU SIGMA ALPHA DINNER 
DANCE BIG SUCCESS
The annual anniversary dinner 
dance of Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity 
was Irery successfully held on De­
cember 27 last. The turnout of mem­
bers was remarkable and although 
slightly crowded at times, , the 
dance floor was well patronized 
throughout the evening. The din­
ner was well served, and evidently 
thoroughly enjoyed by the partici­
pants. The affair was held at the 
Kuhn Rittcnhouse Hotel in East 
End. Coming as it did during the 
holiday season and midway dur­
ing the Christmas vacation, it'pro­
vided many of the night students 
with an opportunity to meet their 
fellow classmen outside the class 
halls.
The fraternity is attracting a 
good deal of attention and is cer­
tain to become a valuable asset to 
the night school. Primarily an or­
ganization for those men who have 
exhibited more than a normal in­
terest in activities, its membership 
is chosen from those students who, 
by their work have qualified, and 
are thereby honored by a call. New 
members will be pledged to the 
Fraternity at an early date, and 
the initiation will take place the 
last of January.
As years go, it is not a very- 
old organization, but success has 
favored all the functions which it 
has sponsored in the past three 
years. This is not to be wondered 
at as it has all the requisites for 
an' "up and doing” organization 
and it will attain its various ob­
jectives. McG.
BOOK STORE SCHEDULE
The Plaid wishes to call the at­
tention of the night studc.-ts.to the 
new schedule which is in operation 
as to hours of the book store. On 
December 1, the evening hours of 
this bool> store room wa.; changed 
to from 6:15 to 8:45 P. M. This 
change in hours gives the night 
student a better chance to obtain 
supplies as they can be procured 
before classes begin.
PUPPET
The Exchange number of Puppet 
will be out on Tuesday, January 
13, and will be on sale the balance 
off. the week. The Exchange num­
ber is always a very popular num­
ber and you should be sure to 
secure your copy from the night 
salesman. The price of the student 
publication is twenty-five cents, not 
a big amount when you consider 
the enjoyment you obtain from its 
contents.
NIGHT ENGINEER’S HOLD 
SUCCESSFUL BANQUET
The night engineers who attend­
ed the annual engineering banquet 
Saturday evening, December 13, 
were unanimous in declaring that 
the affair was the best iunction engi­
neering has yet put over. The 
vote.of thanks and commendation 
given the new body of officers at 
the close of the evening could be 
accepted as the general feeling 
among those present.
Besides having arranged a won­
derful menu, the four officers and 
their aides spared no effort to put 
together the best program for our 
entertainment at any of the func­
tions in a long time. The basic 
idea of the entertainment was en­
tirely new, and the complete ab­
sence of slapsticking was refresh­
ing. The best liked and most ap­
plauded event (banning the M.C., 
who, by the way, was one of the 
most versatile women we know) 
was the polo game. Space pro­
hibits a lengthy description of this 
thrilling meet, but just ask anyone 
who was there.
The guests of the evening were 
Dr. Ihrig, Professor Lcighou and 
Mr. McKclway. Each gave a short 
but very interesting talk, which 
was well, received.
As the night' grew on, the merri­
ment increased until finally, as do 
all good things, the end came witli 
regrets. No need to ask "What’s 
the matter' with. Bob Graham, Bill 
Hoddcr, Werner and Crawford?" 
If you do, however, you’ll get a 
pleasant surprise to find a hard- 
boiled engineer, one who is not 
credited with having any sentiment 
at all (?) shouting, "They’re all 
right.” McG.

CHRISTMAS RECESS DIARY
(Editor’s Note: It has often been 
questioned how a night student 
would or could spend his evenings 
during a vacation period, so the 
timely report or diary of a repre­
sentative night student should fur­
nish a newsy bit of news. Reader, 
how docs this resume parallel your 
case?)
December 17, Wednesday—Ain’t 
dat sumpin? Christmas vacation 
starts tomorrow night and believe 
you me I am going to get a real 
rest and a little fun so that I will 
be in shape for that last*.semester, 
the second one, you know.
December IS, Thursday—First 
night and it ccrtainly feels great to 
stay home for a change. With a 
cold wind blowing outside and the 
thermometer low down, the fireside 
is a comfortable place. Went to 
bed early after doing a little work 
which I had neglected for some 
time. Boy! I’in going to like 
this.
December 19, Friday—Dance at 
Syria Mosque tonight. Met some 
old friends and had a great time, 
Got home late—(early)—but feel 
great.
December 20, Saturday—Date to 
night, and how. Guess we better 
pass over this one.
December 21, Sunday—Quiet eve­
ning at home with friends, so to 
bed. The evening was long, but 
pleasant.
December 22, Monday—Went to 
opening show of the "Sketch 
Book" at the Alvin. Good for 
what ails the tired business man, 
also night student.
December 23, Tuesday—Party at 
the club. These professional boys 
sure know how to throw a real 
affair. Left in time to stop at a 
friend’s home and help with holi­
day houscclcaning (?).
December 24, Wednesday—Christ­
mas Eve. "Peace on Earth and to 
men of good will.” Stopped at 
the girl friend’s home for a few
hours and then home with the 
family.
December 25, Thursday—Christ­
mas Day, a wonderful day. Went 
to the Intcr-collcgiatc ball in eve­
ning. Boy I what a wonderful 
night. Everything was marvelous, 
the lights, the music, the girl, the, 
the------ ah, heck! I’m getting senti­
mental and that won’t do for a 
hard-boiled night student.
December 26, Friday — Almost 
dead from last night's affair, so I 
stayed home and rttircd early.
December 27, Saturday—Frater­
nity Dinner Dance. What a great 
night—ask those who were there, 
if you don’t think so.
December 28, Sunday—Stopped 
at a friend’s home to make plans 
for a New Year’s Eve Party, but 
left early and so home and to bed 
for the night.
December 29, Monday—Went to 
a movie for the first time in ages, 
then home. Tuned in on the ra­
dio, had (root) beer and pretzels.
December 30, T uesday—My con­
science bothered me so I stayed 
home and did some work. No, I 
wasn't sick, just tired.
December 31, Wednesday—New 
Year’s Eve. You know the story; 
yes,-1 did, too. Got home at Six 
A. M. and decided to go to bed 
after a rather hectic night.
January 1, Thursday—New Year’s 
Day, but just the day after the 
night before for me. Got up at 
12 o’clock and laid around like 
worn out inner ,tubc all day and 
night.
January, 2, , Friday—I’ve reform 
cd, folks, and I’m staying home as 
much as possible hereafter. Home 
life is a beautiful thing and I’m 
going to enjoy it to the fullest.
January- 3, Saturday—The gang 
went out and so did I. I’m going 
to stop writing my diary or else 
I’ll convict myself of something or 
other. ^ /
Snok Srttirut linnrttr
It's just too bad when an alleg­
ed book-rcvicwcr takes a vacation. 
Books pile up like nobody’s busi­
ness—and if that is a trite saying, 
forgive it because of the truth be­
neath them there humble words. 
Try to keep from getting out of 
breath and remember that next 
time it won’t be so bad. Well, 
here goes:
"Huddle" is by Francis Wallace, 
and is a football story—as if you 
didn’t know. Wallace wavers be-: 
tween his love for his alma mater 
and football with just enough 
pleasure in his own writing to 
change the "between" in the first 
part of this sentence to "among." 
Which, of course, doesn’t mean
that the raccoons, camcl-hair, etc. 
appareled students won't go in for 
it in the best loved manner. As 
a football story it’s swell; as a 
story—it remains to see his next 
opus. You see, a writer writes
best about what he loves, and this 
one is in his clement, so—or did 
you know what I meant in the 
first place?
"Parties" is by Carl Van Vcch- 
ten. You’re liable to get plastered 
reading it, and don’t say I didn’t 
warn you. Let’s go.
"Mirthful Haven" is by Booth
Tarkingtou in the best Tarkington 
manner. . If you don’t (and who 
is there .that doesn't?) know Tark­
ington, learn all about him from 
this.
"Imperial Palace" is by Arnold
Bennett. You’ve probably heard all
about this and have heard it com­
pared with his first best work: 
Old Wives’ Talc"—which resem­
bled this in length if nothing else. 
I liked this better and if you want 
keen analysis get. it. On second 
though, get it anyway.
Not much space left so here arc 
the hurry up ones:, “Millie" by 
Donald Henderson is brittle as the 
laugh of a nymph dc (or du) pave. 
Get "Seed" by Norris; "Beds" by 
Groucho Marx; “Life of the Ant” 
by Maeterlinck. Get "Beau Lov­
er” by Carmen D. Barnes, in fact, 
make it a point to get it—and 
burn it.

college men choose 
this one outstanding 
SMOKING TOBACCO
T
HE men who go to the univer­
sities of Virginia and Kentucky 
know tobacco .. . they see how it 
grows and what makes it good.
So when Virginia students, and 
the men who stroll down old South ' 
Limestone Street in Lexington, 
pack their pipes with Edgeworth, 
their choice tells volumes about the 
cool, slow-burning quality of this 
favorite smoking tobacco.
It’s the same story everywhere— 
North, South, East and West. In 
42 out of 54 leading colleges and 
universities, college men prefer the 
smooth, fragrant burley blend of 
Edgeworth. Try Edgeworth your­
self. You’ll find more pleasure in 
a pipe than you ever knew before. 
Every tobacco store has Edge- 
worth, 151 the tin. Or, for generous

Professional Football
The following questionnaire has been compiled., by the 
New York Evening Post in an effort to receive the student’s 
opinion on a question which concerns him intimately. The 
Tartan will be glad to publish your opinion.
1. Do you think college football has become professional?’
2. Do you consider this desirable or unfortunate? .
3. Do you blame this on: (a) The present coaching
system, whereby it is alleged that, envious of their pro­
fessional reputations, coaches are out to win at. what­ever cost; (b) The fremendous gate derived from foot­
fall, which supports the other sports? j 
WouHl you fav^r: (a) Limiting the coaching staff tovolunteers from the alumni, serving without pay; (b) 
Hiring the best coaching talent available and increasing 
the staff; (c) Turning the game over to the players 
once it is started and removing the coach from the 
sidelines?
Would you favor: (a) Limiting football squads after
the first few weeks of practice to a certain number of 
men; (b) Permitting the use of a limited number of men in any one game to prevent use of several elevens 
by big colleges against smaller institutions; (c) Do you 
think such unequal contests desirable?
Would you favor: (a) A shorter season held to
traditional foes; (b) One final ex-mural game, such as 
Andover and.Exeter introduced; (c) Restricting inter­
sectional games involving lengthy journeys; (d) Ex­
tending the season and taking on any team that would 
bring the best gate, stressing the championship idea 
and mug-chasing-? t
Would you 'favor: (a) Limiting the tickets to alumni,
undergraduates and friends; (b) Erecting larger stadia 
and catering to the public in general?

ISN'T IT 
TIME 
YOU • • •
TELEPHONED
Mother and *T)ad 
?
Howdy, You All!
The^ Suhthen greeting is due to a 
vacation spent in Missouri and the 
worst parts of Indiana, and a trip 
to see Will Rogers in. "Lightnin’.” 
Out in Missouri, wljere men are men 
and pansies are flowers, you can 
really sec the sun, and you don’t get 
that flannel-feeling in your throat 
which results from walking the 
streets of Pittsburgh.
To get away from they Arthur 
Brisbane stuff, however: how was 
your Christmas? Now that the boys 
have held their annual tic exchange, 
and the girls have exchanged what­
ever they are, may your 1931 be 
full of laughs and not too many 
flunks. By this time you will have 
decided once more that-resolutions 
are great, but not practical, and will 
have settled down to the old order 
of things.
Harry Ziegler and his salesmen arc 
beginning to push the Juniorrc 
Promme in our faces again with the 
latest word that Zack (not Zach- 
orias) Whyte and his Whyte Trucks, 
a hot-cha-cha band from the Hotel 
Savoy, N. Y. C., will preside. The 
favors, according to advance notices, 
are worth walking more than a mile 
for. What is most important, hoiu- 
ever, is the news that the pasteboards 
$7-50 instead of $9.00, as of yore. 
The Men’s J. P. comes down, and 
the Women’s J. P. goes up! Is this 
depression one sided?
Trips seemed the vogue during the 
past holidays, with Joe Cooke start­
ing thevyear off with a bang in 
Atlanta, 'Dutch Eyth investigating 
moral and other conditions in Jama­
ica and Panama, Glen Boyles looking 
for Kitty in IC C., Missouri, and 
the basketball team taking Cleveland 
and Western Reserve by storm.
The Electrical faculty seems to 
have had a free-for-all during the 
holidays. “Gloomy Git's” Gabler car­
ries an ear in a shroud, and "Denny” 
Dennison has an eyc-broW one and 
half times as long as the other one. 
"D. C.” Porter’s nerves Were shat­
tered to such a degree that he “blew 
the breaker” in Jab the other day, 
an event that costs a student one 
dollar when done by him.
Some kind soul entered the Kappa 
Delta Rlio house Tuesday night and 
removed four or five watches plus 
a large sum 1 of money. The K. D. 
R.’s say that amounts from $100 to 
$300 were stolen, but we all know 
they never have that much money in 
the house at one time, ^nyway, a 
burglar alarm has been installed and 
marauders arc cautioned to use only 
the upstairs windows. If the alarm 
sounded, however, the .boys would 
probably turn off their alarm clocks 
1 and keep on sleeping.

of each one is a dominant motif 
(doubtless bearing a significance of 
which wc are-ignorant) from which 
smaller afl-over -patterns * radiated: 
The Mexicans have a symbolical 
art and: many ' of their most
revered animals compose the pat­
terns.
That all of Mexico does not 
divide its time between serenading 
fair señoritas or in rebelling against: 
the government is demonstrated by 
the very domestic bits of wooden 
furniture belonging, to .the break­
fast nook. These .is 'a little table.' 
and two seats that are a cross be­
tween double and single oncsidoric 
in natural wood, they add a pleas­
ant touch of. hominess ’To 'the oth­
erwise foreign atmosphere. .
Their feather work dates back 
before 'the time of the Conquest 
and is very marvelously done—in- 
the estimation of- some critics: be­
ing the most important and char­
acteristic bit of the exhibition.
MEXICAN FINE ARTS
(Continued from Page One) 
the Exhibition cover, all possible 
phases. There are many and varied 
examples of early and ’contempô- 
rary bone carvings, metal work, 
pottery, wooven rush work, textiles, 
lacquer ware, feather . mosaics, 
leather work, and ceremonial masks 
and costumes. The . modern meth­
ods of making pottery and 6? 
weaving textiles have changed 'very 
little. Many of the. textiles are, 
still made on primitive-: nafid -looms.'1
There are many of the clay 
wood, and reed toys in the Exhibi­
tion, .for which the Mexican crafts; 
man is noted. Mexican toys are 
frequently the spontaneous crea­
tions of'Mexican parents : for their 
children. There are several exam­
ples in the Exhibition of the 
painted pigs, already made famous 
by Mrs. 'Dwight- W. Morrow in 
her book for children, “The Paint^ 
cd' Piè,” the illustrations for : which 
were made by Count d’Harnon- 
court.
Painting, sculpturing and wood- 
cuts are also represented. Con­
temporary artists include the well 
known Miguel Covarrubias, Diego 
Rivera, and Jose Clemente Orozo- 
co. Oil and water color are the 
principal mediums used. A section 
of the’ Exhibition, representing the 
work done in water color by school 
children between the ages of six 
and fifteen, is exceptionally inter­
esting.
The Exhibition, which opened 
January 8, will continue until Feb­
ruary 4. During the time of .the 
show; Count d’Harnoncourt will 
give informal gallery talks of the 
arts of Mexico. ’ ' ,1

THE INTERCOLLEGIATE 
BRAWL
We readied the Intercollegiate 
Ball at the William Penn, Christ­
mas night, about twelve. And nev­
er- have- -we seen such a mob. At 
rib time had we ever dreamed that 
there ;were so many tuxedos in' 
Pittsburgh. There must have been 
2,000 couples. And never, too, have 
we U s.een [so many attractive girls 
gathered together at one spot. Lit­
erally thousands of them, many of 
them exquisitely gowned; all beau­
tifully groomed; we tell you it was 
a._ revelation. Most dances one 
goes to, you know, there is the 
usual collection of wall flowers, not 
to neglect, -what Kipling would call 
“second rate women.” But here, 
;they were all first rate.' *
The fourth miracle was the. 
^crowd—they were sober as an un­
dertaker. Never, in his chastest 
-dreams, could Andy Volstead have 
wished for a more arid affair.
:Spasmodically,;- in corridors, we’d 
see a bottle raised, but no o/ie was 
drunk. There was none of this 
sickening intoxication damaging to 
both self and hotel. And Anthony 
Comstock would have delightpd, 
too, for of necking—of: even the 
most casual caress—we did not sec 
a speck (and we were looking!),
The third' miracle was the men. 
Smooth, good looking, clean cut, 
quiet, no palpitating co-ed heart’ 
could have desired more. Here' 
and there the blue of an Annapolis 
man would show, and irregularly 
the grey of West Point would shine 
from the mob. Prim as a ramrod, 
their backs would ooze through the 
twisting collegiate dancers like 
some mighty tank, or drcadnaught.
Collegiate, did we say? Ah, that 
is where the rub. came in. After 
four , years, . I have . a nodding 
knowledge of almost everyone on 
the Tartan campus; my companion 
is. one of the best known figures 
at Pitt. HoW many people did we 
know there? We counted up—our 
total count out of . the 4,000 under­
graduates was exactly three,, one 
of'them a boy who busted out of 
Pitt.his freshman year.
Who was this crowd? We can’t 
figure. Smooth men, amazingly at­
tractive women, no drinking, 110 
petting?' Qiien Sabc? The Urban 
Room was jammed. For the first 
time in my life it looked as small 
as my fraternity house living room. 
The ball room adjoining was so 
thick Avith couples you couldn’t 
move—night club technique in an 
area of a city' block. There were 
two good orchfcstras, one in each 
room, that played-continuously and 
continuously. The lobbies and ad­
joining' rooms were jammed, too, 
couples sitting, smoking, talking— 
but all with perfect decorum.
Two amusing rackets—when yoU 
came in, the check room girl, to 
avoid getting gyped, charged you in 
advance for your clothes. When 
you entered the dance floor, a

tors to check the rapidity with 
which the point total of the Skibo 
lads had been mounting.
The Sophomore stars, Smith and 
Fergus,( once more put up a fine 
exhibition. Smith lead the Tartan 
scoring while Jim Fergus featured 
from the foul line and did dandy 
guarding. To say that any one 
man stared, however, would be un­
just to the rest of the team. The 
j jumping of Merten and Stentz was 
a big boost to the Tartan total for 
the team scored a number of bas­
kets 011 well executed top-off plays. 
Captain Nease did excellent passing 
as well as pressing Smith for scor­
ing Oion®rs while little “Jimmy”

offense. •

He Got.t;he Facts 
Behind the News!
Stretching its huge bulk across the San Francisquito 
Canyon, the St. Francis dam cupped a deep blue lake 
of water against the hills. Peacefully, fruitfully tilling 
the soil in the valley below were the water-hungry 
farmers of Santa Clara.
Then, something happened! Without warning, the-' 
great man-built barrier crumbled. A vast flood reared 
its bulk into a ferocious torrent—smashed every­
thing that stood in its path. Another unwarranted 
disaster. Lives lost! Property destroyed! Why?
An 'Engineering News-Record editor in San Francisco jumped a.fast train. Rapidly he surveyed the scene; 
investigated and photographed the remaining traces of structural fault; wired his paper.*Fast news? Yes, but what of-his story? Nothing sen­
sational in the story he wired—no wrath-stirring 
ad j ectives calculated to arouse public sentiment. This 
editor tersely related the reasons for the disaster— 
scientifically pieced together the causes of founda­tion failure—gave construction engineers the facts 
which they could not get from newspaper stories;
Many weeks later an official investigating commission 
confirmed, almost to a word, that first telegraphic 
flash of the McGraw-Hill editor. Meantimes, editors 
of metropolitan dailies used the McGraw-Hill story 
to reassure their readers that similar disasters were 
not likely to occur in other places.
Each McGraw-Hill Publication has built a splendid 
reputation»among leaders of industry and business 
for truth, leadership, constructive foresight. From 
the publication which covers your chosen field, you 
will get a close-up of what your future employers 
and fellow-workers are thinking of and doing. 
McGraw-Hill Publications are in your college library.
