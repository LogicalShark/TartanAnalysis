Gigapans feature Civil War trails, museums

Imagine sitting at your 
computer, with the world at 
your fingertips, and being able/ 
to explore historic Gettysburg 
and see where Abraham Lin­
coln once spoke “four score 
and seven years ago.” Perhaps 
you’d like to take a trip down 
a Civil War soldier’s memory 
lane to Little Round Top to see 
where a great battle was once 
waged.
Thanks to recent develop­
ments in Gigapan technology 
and Google Earth, this dream 
is now a reality. Pennsylvania 
Civil War trails are now view­
able in Google Earth. Giga­
pan is a high-resolution im­
age technology developed in 
part by Carnegie Mellon, the 
NASA Ames Research Center, 
Google, Gigapah Systems, and 
Deep Local, Inc. It is a part 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Global 
Connection Project initiative, 
which, according to the proj­
ect’s website, “develops soft­
ware tools and technologies 
to increase the power of im­
ages to connect, inform, and 
inspire people to become en­
gaged and responsible global 
citizens.”

What is ranked as the 
number-one fear among 
human beings? Jonathan 
Fields, former private equity 
attorney turned lifestyle en­
trepreneur, informed his au­
dience that it was, amusingly 
enough, “the fear of public 
speaking.” Fields spoke at the 
TEDx conference, hosted by 
Carnegie Mellon on Sunday, 
April 4.
TEDx is a relatively new 
program that allows local 
communities such as schools, 
businesses, libraries, and 
neighborhoods to organize, 
design, and host their own 
independent event using 
the annual Technology, En­
tertainment, Design (TED) 
conference model. The “x” 
in TEDx stands for “inde­
pendently organized TED
• event.” TEDxCMU was one 
of the many mini spin-offs 
of the annual TED talks that 
are held in locations around 
the world. The original TED 
event aimed to bring together 
luminaries who are often un­
acknowledged in the fields of 
science, politics, philanthro­
py, business, and art.
A team of 11 students or­
ganized the Carnegie Mellon- 
centered event, overseen by 
Yongho Shin, a junior busi­
ness administration major, 
and Sachit Gupta, a senior 
information systems ma­
jor. “When I saw it online, I 
thought how amazing would 
it be if instead of just watch­
ing the talks online we could 
actually bring it here and 
have people actually sit in the 
place [where] it was happen­
ing,” Shin said.
The theme of this particu­
lar conference was “being 
fearless.” “I decided on the 
theme fearless,” Shin said, 
“because I thought it was a 
quality people can benefit 
from, and by bringing people 
that have done fearless things 
I wanted people to learn from 
that. We want the guests to 
actually think about what 
they are hearing and leave 
with something that they 
didn’t have before.”
“And use that to sort of do 
something later on. We want 
them to learn something that 
they can use to change some­
thing in the world,” Gupta 
added.
The presentations took 
place in McConomy Audito­
rium in the University Center 
last Sunday from 10:30 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. As expected, there 
was a lot of interest for the 
event, but unfortunately seat­
ing was limited. As a result,
over 200 people were denied 
a seat in the 450-seat audi­
torium. “We were surprised 
by the response,” Gupta said 
when asked about the pos­
sibility of making more seats 
available. Speeches at the 
event were capped at 18 min­
utes, and there were no ques- 
tion-and-answer sessions. 
Speakers were not paid for 
the appearance and received 
no compensation for their 
travel expenses. What’s more, 
speakers had to sit in the au­
dience before their talk, and 
no laptops were allowed for 
note-taking.
Emcee Aman Chawla led 
and organized the confer­
ence. Chawla described the 
conference as a great oppor­
tunity for Carnegie Mellon 
and the community in gen­
eral. “It increases CMU’s pres­
ence in a public light by bring­
ing such illustrious alumni to 
the campus and by bringing 
so many people to CMU to 
' see this, which I think is fan­
tastic for the community and 
CMU,” Chawla said.
TEDxCMU speaker, car­
toonist, and multi-disciplin- 
ary artist Raghava Kaly- 
anaraman, better known as 
Raghava KK, was no stranger 
to TED. Just two months ago, 
in February, KK shared the 
spotlight alongside Bill Gates 
and Sheryl Crowe at the TED 
conference in Long Beach, 
Calif. “I am no authority on 
how to handle fear, but I 
have some instances on how 
to deal with fear,” KK said. “I 
use fear to motivate me. One 
of my philosophies is that if 
you want to do something, do 
it now. If you don’t have what 
it takes to do it, acquire it. 
Don’t second-guess yourself. 
Learn from your past.”
Apart from Fields and 
KK, the other speakers at 
the event included Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus and CEO of 
two Pittsburgh-based compa­
nies Robert F. Culberston III, 
blogger and world traveler 
Chris Guillebeau, Carnegie 
Mellon faculty member and 
former Walt Disney imagi- 
neer Mk Haley, photographer 
and social artist Chase Jarvis, 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus 
and CEO of Pittsburgh-based 
Deeplocal Nathan Martin, 
and Carnegie Mellon alum­
nus and entrepreneur Stacey 
Monk.
Their talks covered a va­
riety of topics with personal 
experiences and anecdotes, 
all with the ultimate aim of 
spreading the lessons the 
speakers had learned about 
being fearless. Culberston,

Silicon Valley course combines 
engineering, entrepreneurship
All that is required to submit 
a nomination is an application 
found on the student govern­
ment website (https://stugov. 
andrew.cmu.edu) and a 250- 
word explanation as to why 
the nominated person is wor­
thy of being called a “Carnegie 
Hero.”
The Carnegie Heroes pro­
gram originated from senior 
H&SS interdisciplinary social 
and decision sciences major 
Rotimi Abimbola, the student 
body president.
“In the fall semester, after 
hearing of many instances 
and stories about members of 
the campus community per­
forming extraordinary acts of 
kindness and goodwill, I came 
up with the idea of creating a 
program that celebrates ser­
vice and building community 
on campus,” Abimbola said.
Alpha Phi Omega and the 
student government had al­
ready cooperated on the Help 
Haiti Campaign and found 
another good opportunity to 
combine their strengths with 
the Carnegie Heroes pro­
gram.

students from both Alpha Phi

entrepreneurs and venture 
capitalists while living in Sili­

Students in 96-800 will 
build an original application, 
present it to a real venture 
capital firm, post it on Face- 
book or the iPhone App Store, 
and finally be graded on the 
success and profitability of 
the application.
Sedaño described it as 
“American Idol for geeks 
where VCs [venture capital­
ists] play the role of Simon 
Cowell.”
While building an original 
and profitable application for 
Facebook or the iPhone in just 
12 weeks certainly sounds 
difficult, Sedaño and Russell 
stress how Facebook and the 
iPhone are easy platforms to 
work with and have much po­
tential.
“We all know that the best 
software applications are easy 
to use. We believe the key to 
making it easy is to get cus­
tomer feedback early and of­
ten. The Facebook and iPhone 
platforms now allow you to do 
just that,” Russell said. Under­
standing the marketplace is 
a key aspect of making a suc­
cessful application, added Se­
daño. “Right now successful 
Facebook apps are mostly ca­
sual games. The larger screen 
of the iPad is a fundamental 
game changer for iPhone de­
velopment.”
Both Sedaño and Russell 
stressed a very customer-cen-

This summer, students 
will have the opportunity to 
develop their own Facebook 
or iPhone applications at Car­
negie Mellon’s Silicon Valley 
campus in the 12-week course 
96-800: Real World Software

The class will be taught by 
adjunct professor Scott Rus­

Russell and Sedano gradu-

1982 and 1996, respectively, 
both receiving degrees in 
mathematics and computer 
science.
There are few courses 
available to undergraduates 
at Carnegie Mellon that blur 
the line between the class­

Have you ever had an ex­
perience with a true “hero” on 
campus, whether in the class­
room, on a service project, or 
in your daily life? With the new 
Carnegie Heroes Program, 
sponsored by student govern­
ment and Carnegie Mellon’s 
service fraternity, Alpha Phi 
Omega, now is your chance to 
recognize the heroes in your 
life. “We will be distributing 
applications in the next week 
and asking students to tell us 
about people who they be­
lieve should be nominated as 
a hero,” said Angel Gonzalez,
a junior social and decision 
sciences major and member of 
Alpha Phi Omega.
Students, faculty, or staff 
at Carnegie Mellon who have 
had an impact can be nomi­
nated. An individual can be 
nominated to be a hero for 
numerous reasons, not solely 
based on community service.

Campus promotes alumni, Scotland Week
Campaign to recruit alumni Scottish heritage honored
“Loyal Scot” banners ap­
peared across campus in re­
cent weeks, featuring a “Plaid 
to the Bone” slogan..
The campaign, sponsored 
by the Carnegie Mellon 
Alumni Association, aims to 
keep alumni connected to 
the university and focuses on 
four steps: staying informed, 
getting involved, giving back, 
and showing Carnegie Mel­
lon pride. ,
The program offers alum­
ni easy ways to complete each 
of the steps, such as by volun­
teering as a local recruiter or 
by nominating someone for 
an alumni award.
The Loyal Scot program 
also offers recognition for 
attending Carnegie Mel­
lon events. The next major 
event is Carnival this week.
Reunions will be held by de­
cade for all Carnegie Mellon 
classes. Alumni events in­
clude a golf outing as well as 
standard Carnival events like 
Buggy.
After returning home, 
alumni are encouraged to 
stay involved and volunteer 
within their regional com­
munities. Some of these rec­
ommendations are alumni- 
focused, such as volunteering 
to serve on reunion commit­
tees or joining an alumni in­
terest group. Alumni can also 
sign up to help recruit stu­
dents from their areas.
Interested students and 
alumni can visit www.cmu. 
edu/loyalscot or e-mail loyal- 
scot@andrew.cmu.edu for 
more information about the 
program.
As part of Scotland Week 
2010, Scottish Education 
Minister Michael Russell 
spoke in the Peter/Wright/ 
McKenna rooms in the Uni­
versity Center last Monday. 
Russell’s talk, titled “Scotland
— A New Future Building 
on a Great Past,” discussed 
the common ties shared be­
tween Carnegie Mellon and 
Scotland, as well as the ref­
erendum bill in Scotland. 
The bill and Russell’s speech 
addressed Scottish autonomy 
and independence.
Scotland Week, which ran 
from April 3 to 10, is an annu­
al event planned by the Scot­
tish government in which 
ministers travel around the 
United States and Canada to 
spread awareness of and cel­
ebrate Scottish culture. Three
Scottish government minis­
ters traveled to North Amer­
ica to promote the themes of 
Scotland Week, including the 
theme of “Great Scots and In­
novation,” which drew con­
nections to Carnegie Mellon.
The subjects of Russell’s 
talk have generated contro­
versy in the United Kingdom, 
with many opposition lead­
ers in Scotland criticizing 
the minister’s advocacy of 
independence on a taxpayer- 
funded trip.

Students in Silicon Valley course to create Facebook, iPhone apps
VALLEY, from A1
ing applications.
“The course is encouraging 
student teams to develop and 
launch a Facebook or iPhone 
application because it is pos­
sible to build simple applica­
tions quickly and get real cus­
tomer feedback,” explained 
Russell.
“Determine who is your 
target user group and figure 
out what problem you are 
solving for them. If possible, 
start talking to people who 
might use your product. Work 
out paper prototypes and 
show them to people.”
“The course attracted me 
as the best learning program 
on how to build a profitable 
software business from an 
idea,” said master’s student 
Reggie Nair, who will be tak­
ing the course. “Being an ex­
perienced software engineer, 
I know how to win the techni­
cal challenges. However, the 
steps to raise funds, market­
ing, and revenue generation 
are a mystery.”
Interested students are ex­
pected to form groups of two 
to four prior to enrollment in 
the course. Although building 
any type of software should 
require a team with at least
one member with proven 
computer skills, Sedano en­
courages other majors to join 
as well. “I’d love to see teams 
with people from different 
colleges,” he said. “Spend 
time trying to form a team 
with people of different skill 
sets.” The course itself is open 
to any Carnegie Mellon stu­
dent so long as the student is 
in a team.
Space in the course is ex­
tremely limited. Any students 
planning to submit an appli­
cation should e-mail Sedano 
at todd.sedano@sv.cmu.edu.

Gigapans 
increase 
access to 
war trails
GIGAPAN, from A1
“gigapixel panoramas,” are 
extremejy high-resolution 
images that are taken using 
a robotic mount for a digital 
camera and state-of-the-art 
software. Gigapan’s mis­
sion, “to make all aspects 
of the Gigapan experience 
accessible and affordable 
to the broadest possible 
community,” is now coming 
to life through the use of 
Google Earth, which is free 
to use from any computer.
Gigapans of Pennsyl­
vania Civil War trails are 
the first of their kind to be 
featured on Google Earth. 
Along with historic battle­
fields, other aspects of 
Pennsylvania’s Civil War 
history are viewable in 
Gigapans^ including cem­
eteries, monuments, and 
museum exhibits.
Not everyone supports 
the idea that visiting a mu­
seum through your com­
puter screen is a brilliant in­
vention, however. First-year 
history major Isabel Smith- 
Bernstein, who comes from 
a family of individuals in­
volved with museum man­
agement and conservation, 
spoke out against the Giga­
pans. “I think [the Gigapans 
are] stupid, because it takes 
away the experience of ac­
tually going there. It takes 
away the impact of actually 
standing in the same space 
as hundreds of Civil War 
soldiers,” she said. “There’s 
a certain feeling that you 
get when you’re at place 
with so much history, and 
that will just go away. Since 
the youth of today already 
are alarmingly disinterest­
ed in history, this will only 
increase that disinterest, 
since there’s no more im­
pact — no punch. Just an­
other computer screen with 
some pictures. It makes the 
travel less important.”
George Cornelius, sec­
retary of the Pennsylvania 
Department of Community 
and Economic Develop­
ment, pointed out some pos­
itives of the Gigapans, a de­
velopment that he believes 
will allow Pennsylvania to 
emerge as a leader in the 
tourism industry. “This new 
tool for Pennsylvania Civil 
War trails will allow Penn­
sylvania to solidify its posi­
tion as an industry ‘thought 
leader’ in tourism by not 
just embracing emerging 
technologies, but by build­
ing them,” Cornelius said in 
a press release on Carnegie 
Mellon’s website.
A former anthropology 
major, sophomore Chrissy 
Swierkocki wondered how 
much further this technol­
ogy can go.
“Hopefully other parts of 
the country and the world 
can utilize this technology 
in their own historic areas,” 
she commented. “Especially 
with museums, it’d be great 
to have those resources 
available online.”

Carnegie Heroes to honor studentservice initiativesV *
HEROES, from A1
ment will determine who is 
to be honored at the third an­
nual President’s Dinner.
With recognition now be­
ing offered to those who per­
form myriad good deeds on 
campus, student government' 
and Alpha Phi Omega hope 
students will use this oppor­
tunity to learn more about 
the various types of service 
offered on campus.
Medini Annavajhala, a 
sophomore in the Science 
and Humanities Scholars 
program, and the Ameri- 
Corps Service Scholar for this 
school year, felt the award 
program would have a posi­
tive effect.
“I think highlighting the 
fact that there is actually 
community service on cam­
pus will make people more 
willing to give up part of their 
own time and put in time to
work towards a better and 
more cohesive community,” 
Annavajhala said.
As one of two AmeriCorps 
Scholars on campus, An- 
navajhala’s work on campus 
is dedicated to developing 
service programs and sup­
porting the campus service 
organizations among other 
initiatives.

Professor predicts life in the future will resemble games
DYLAN MORI
Staffwriter
To many people, video 
games are an essential part 
of life. What attracts people 
to games varies: for some it’s 
the competition: For some it’s 
about problem solving, and 
for others it’s just recreation­
al. However, according to one

Carnegie Mellon professor, 
life may one day resemble the 
games that so many enjoy, as 
more companies and busi­
nesses are making products 
that take advantage of popu­
lar elements of video games.
Jesse Schell is a professor 
of game design and teaches 
the popular Building Virtual 
Worlds course in the Enter­
tainment Technology Center. 
He also owns his own line of 
video games, Schell Games. 
He coined the term “Gamep- 
ocalypse” in order to describe 
what he thinks is life’s resem­
blance to a video game. “We 
already see games creeping 
up into our everyday lives 
in all kinds of funny ways,” 
Schell noted in an interview 
with The Escapist magazine.
Schell cited several ex­
amples of Gamepocalypse in 
the same interview, including 
Starbucks using a point sys­
tem in order to provide its cus­
tomers with rewards such as 
coupons and price reductions. 
In an interview with CNN, he 
claimed that people’s lives will 
be “co-opted by games, sort of 
like how we saw advertising 
co-opt huge amounts of lives 
in the 20th century.”
Schell credits new devel­
opments in tracking technol­
ogy as a catalyst for Gamep­
ocalypse. “Games are always
trying to be new,” he said, 
“and one way to create new 
games is through new kinds 
of input.” Schell points at in­
put technologies in games like 
Dance Dance Revolution and 
the Wii remote, which tracks 
the movement of the body 
and makes it a part of game- 
play. Such input technology 
can also be seen in recent gad­
gets such as smartphones and 
GPS systems, which take in a 
certain location as input.
Schell also noted that cam­
era technologies will be the 
next big step in input technol­
ogy. Cameras have necessary 
functions for capturing facial 
expressions and determining 
location, and such technol­
ogy has already been imple­
mented in the Xbox 360 and 
Nintendo DSi.
The Internet and Wi-Fi will 
also contribute to Gamepoca­
lypse growth in the coming 
years, Schell predicts. “Any­
thing meaningful that you 
do in your life,” Schell said, 
“there are ways that you’ll 
want to hook it up to the In­
ternet.” Indeed, with technol­
ogies like Nike+ shoes, which 
measure the number of steps 
taken while wearing them 
and can be connected to com­
puters via USB, connectivity is

Thalidomide: How a helpful drug 
may cause more harm than good
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Contributing Editor
In the late 1950s, many 
women began giving birth to 
babies with severe limb de­
fects. These babies had limbs 
that resembled the flippers of 
whales or seals — the limbs 
were extremely short with the
fingers often protruding from 
the shoulder blades. Scientists 
coined this condition “phoc- 
omelia,” literally meaning 
“seal limb,” but were baffled 
as to what could be the cause 
of these debilitating defects. 
A New York Times article illus­
trates that the problem was 
most severe in Europe, and it
was not until nearly 10,000 
children had been born with 
this defect that the cause 
was determined. The prob­
lem stemmed from popular 
pills that pregnant women 
took to counter morning sick­
ness, pills which contained a

HQW THINGS,, W,Q.RK,PrEP and iPrEP: Preventative HIV drug may be an effective treatment
HEE YEON SHIN
Junior Staffwriter
Globally, more than 7000 
people are infected with HIV 
every day, totaling to the stag­
gering figure of approximately 
2.7 million people per year. 
Can a pill a day help turn the 
tide of this pandemic? Scien­
tists and government officials 
are seriously looking for an 
answer to this question. The 
answer is HIV Pre-Exposure 
Prophylaxis, known as PrEP 
for short. Prophylaxis treat­
ment is a form of disease pre­
vention that involves taking 
medicine before exposure to 
the disease.
This new up-and-comer 
for HIV/AIDS prevention is 
not a completely unfamiliar 
idea. There are other areas of 
medicine where prevention 
through chemical prophylaxis 
has been effective. Taking 
malaria medications, for ex­
ample, before one travels to 
malaria-affected countries is 
also a form of PrEP. This way, 
the medicine against the ma­
laria parasites is already in 
one’s bloodstream to fight off 
the virus the instant the body 
comes in contact with the 
parasites. Wearing sunscreen 
before exposure to sun to pre­
vent sunburn is also a form of 
PrEP. Scientists are investigat­
ing whether a similar method 
will work for HIV.
Although antiretroviral 
medicine, which suppresses 
the replication of HIV, has only 
been used as a treatment after 
HIV infection so far, scientists 
are exploring if antiretroviral 
medicine can also be used for 
prevention. With efforts for 
an HIV/AIDS vaccine repeat­
edly failing, PrEP is now in 
the spotlight as a safe and ef­
fective risk-reducing method. 
Currently, the United States 
Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) are 
conducting clinical trials of 
HIV PrEP inside and outside of 
the country. Evidence seems 
to support encouraging pos­
sibilities for PrEP, yet practical 
concerns for implementation 
still remain.
While all clinical trials so 
far are for only the standard 
everyday PrEP with everyday 
doses of antiretroviral medi­
cation, some researchers are 
looking into intermittent PrEP, 
or iPrEP.. Prevention through 
using antiretroviral medicine 
before exposure is the same 
as with iPrEP. Yet iPrEP looks 
into taking antiretroviral drugs 
only during certain days of the 
week or before anticipated 
HIV exposure.
Scientists have high hopes 
for PrEP because of the impli­
cations of previous studies on 
HIV/AIDS prevention. First, 
the CDC cites studies where 
mothers during labor and 
newborns after birth were giv­
en antiretroviral drugs, which 
show that the risk of infection 
for the newborns from their 
mothers was reduced by about 
50 percent. Second, when 
health care workers took an­
tiretroviral drugs promptly 
after accidental exposures 
and continuously for several 
weeks, there was a significant 
reduction in the risk of infec­
tion. Third, it has been shown 
in monkeys that PrEP with an­
tiretroviral medicine reduces 
the risk of their infection with 
a virus like HIV for monkeys.
In addition to previous 
clinical trials, a mathemati­
cal model study gave weight 
to the optimistic prospects of 
PrEP. A study led by David Pal- 
tiel in the Yale School of Public 
Health revealed that if PrEP 
were introduced, it would dra­
matically cut the lifetime in­
fection rate for men who have 
sex with men from 44 percent 
to 25 percent. This mathemat­
ical model was based on an 
already existing dataset of a 
sample of men who have sex 
with men from a vaccine trial 
study, with the mean age of

Our universe may be inside a wormhole New species live without oxygenMemristors may replace transistors
Scientists have long been baffled by the creation of our uni­
verse, but an idea has been proposed that may give insight into 
many unanswered questions, including the elusive theory unify­
ing the four fundamental forces of nature.
Nikodem Poplawski, a theoretical physicist at Indiana Univer­
sity in Bloomington, has suggested that our universe may have 
been born from a larger universe. His theory makes use of white 
holes, which can be seen as the reverse of black holes. Matter 
cannot enter white holes, but it can escape. White holes are con­
nected to black holes by wormholes.
According to Poplawski, an implosion may have occurred in 
the larger universe, creating a wormhole that connects a white 
and black hole. Our universe is inside this wormhole, and since 
matter can only move in one direction, this accounts for the ob­
served expanding universe.
Every time a black hole is created, he says, another universe 
may be forming inside a wormhole.
Three species of Loridfera, tiny 
animals that live in marine sedi­
ment, have been discovered in the 
Mediterranean Sea at the bottom of 
L’Atelante Basin, whose extreme sa­
linity prevents oxygen from mixing 
with the water. These are the first 
organisms discovered that spend 
their entire lives in an oxygen-free 
environment.
The new species, which have 
not yet been named, do not use 
mitochondria for energy. Mitochondria are organelles, or struc­
tures in a cell, that are present in every organism that needs oxy­
gen. Instead, they use a different organelle that produces energy 
without oxygen. This discovery confirms the possibility of ani­
mals living in the most hazardous environments.

Hewlett-Packard has announced that memristors, a short­
ened form for “memory transistors,” may replace traditional 
transistors in computers as the size of computer chips becomes 
atomic. Transistors are an important component in most, if not 
all, electronics, and amplify or switch electrical signals to direct 
them correctly.
Today’s transistors are semiconductor transistors, but mem­
ristors can also store information without the need of an electri­
cal current. Scientists say they resemble biological brains more 
than computing devices.
Memristor technology uses a thin film of titanium dioxide, 
which changes atomic structure slightly when current is passed 
through. This small alteration causes the resistivity of the film 
to change, which can be measured. Memristors will be 10 times 
smaller than the most advanced transistors today at a size of only 
three nanometers, and they will be able to work at speeds mea­
sured in nanoseconds.

MULE looks to revolutionize laptop security by using location
ABHAY BUCH
Staffwriter
Keeping data secure is not easy. With one lapse of judg­
ment and one lost laptop, millions of credit card and 
Social Security numbers can fall into the hands of 
fraudsters and criminals. Average people also 
have some amount of personal information 
on their computers that they would not 
want to be made available to the high­
est bidder.
However, only a few people are 
paranoid enough to take effective 
measures against such possibilities.
Carnegie Mellon professor Adrian Per- 
rig and Ph.D. student Ahren Studer may 
have a solution for everyone.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press 
release, Perrig and Studer’s project, 
called MULE (Mobile User Location- 
specific Encryption), provides a way 
for the average user to effortlessly en­
sure that his or her sensitive digital files 
are safe even when the laptop that con­
tains them is lost or stolen.
According to Studer, MULE is a 
“means to protect sensitive documentsv 
on laptops, so that if you lose your 
laptop, all of your sensitive documents 
would still be secure.”
Traditionally, the reason security is 
compromised is not because the tech­
nology is not powerful enough, but 
because people cannot be bothered 
to jump through the hoops needed for 
security.
People want passwords that are easy 
to remember, but such passwords are of­
ten easily broken by guessing randomly.
The team has come up with the innovative 
idea of having the user’s location act as the 
“password.”
They noticed that people usually access sen­
sitive data in trusted locations. Most people would 
prefer to file their tax returns at home rather than at a coffee 
shop. Employees tend to look at confidential documents at the 
office rather than on a park bench.
Thus, by ensuring that certain pieces of data can only be accessed 
certain locations, a thief would have.to return to the person’s home in or-Frances Soong/Art Staff
der to access the data, an unlikely occurrence.
Perrig and Studer ensure that the sensitive data can only be 
accessed at the trusted location by encrypting the data, ren­
dering it unreadable, and then ensuring that it can 
only be decrypted using information that is only 
available at the trusted location.
According to the researcher’s project re­
port, found online at sparrow.ece.cmu. 
edu/group/pub/studer_wisecl0.pdf, 
all one needs is a webcam installed 
with Trusted Platform Modules, 
which are already installed with 
most webcams.
The user would then have to 
install a trusted location device 
that would send location data 
to the laptop. This informa­
tion is transmitted to the 
computer through an infra­
red transmitter similar to 
the one in a TV remote and 
is received by a webcam 
that many laptops already 
have built in.
Since infrared signals 
cannot pass through walls, 
anyone who cannot see the 
transmitter cannot de­
crypt the data.
In addition, since the 
signal is invisible, it can 
be kept running continu­
ously, reducing the need 
for the user to interact 
with it.
This forms part of Stud­
er’s larger research interest, 
which is about physical se­
curity as digital security. 
His idea is simple: If your 
data is in a place where 
thieves cannot get to it phys­
ically, they are also unable to 
get to it though digital means like 
hacking.
He hopes that enough people will 
be interested in the research to pick it 
up for production or to work with him to 
popularize it.
Thalidomide treatment for morning sickness linked to birth defects
THALIDOMIDE, from A4
substance known as thalido­
mide.
Soon after the harmful ef­
fects of thalidomide on devel­
oping embryos were deter­
mined, the morning sickness 
pill was banned. However, tha­
lidomide is not completely out 
of the picture; in fact, the drug 
is extremely effective in curing 
certain skin diseases and can­
cers. According to an article 
on www.MayoClinic.com, in 
1998 the FDA approved the 
use of thalidomide for treat­
ing skin lesions formed due to 
leprosy. In 2006, the FDA also 
approved the use of thalido­
mide for treating multiple my­
eloma — cancer affecting the 
blood and bone marrow. Tha­
lidomide is especially useful 
as an anti-cancer therapy as 
it prevents the recruitment of 
blood vessels to newly formed 
tumors, thus preventing the 
cancerous cells from growing 
and spreading. The drug has 
proven to be useful in treating 
mouth ulcers of HIV patients
and also as an anti-inflamma- 
tory agent. However, in spite 
of thalidomide’s usefulness, 
many still fear that its contin­
ued use will once again give 
rise to babies with severe limb 
defects.
Unraveling the mystery be­
hind thalidomide means figur­
ing out how it can be so useful 
in some instances and so debil­
itating in others. This has been 
the primary focus of many 
researchers for some time. Re­
searchers have been trying to 
create a drug that can be used 
as a thalidomide replacement, 
which will have all the posi­
tive effects of the drug but will 
be safer to use. The New York 
Times article describes that 
one of the major difficulties 
in studying thalidomide is the 
fact that it breaks down into
18 different chemicals once it 
enters the body. Out of the 18 
possible chemicals that could 
cause embryonic defects, sci­
entists were able to narrow 
the possibilities down to one 
chemical, called CPS49. When 
CPS49 was tested on chicken
embryos, it caused limb de­
fects in the developing chicks. 
Scientists hypothesize that 
CPS49 prevents the develop­
ment of blood vessels — a 
property extremely valuable 
for dealing with cancer, but 
dangerous for the developing 
embryo.
In the developing embryos, 
structures called limb buds 
eventually form limbs. Devel­
opment from the limb buds 
begins later than other struc­
tures of the body. Hence, if 
thalidomide is taken in later 
stages of pregnancy, other 
body parts of the embryo will 
not be affected since the blood 
vessels in these parts are al­
ready formed. However, since 
the blood vessels to the limbs 
are still forming, the drug 
could cause limb defects.
The role of CPS49 in limb 
defects was described in a 
paper published last year, but 
the exact mechanism by which 
CPS49 affected development 
was relatively unknown. And 
just a month ago, one of the 
major pieces of the thalido­
mide puzzle fell into place.
According to an article 
publishèd this March in Sci­
ence, thalidomide is capable 
of binding to a protein known 
as cereblon, which is found in 
both adult and embryonic tis­
sues. Scientists found out that 
preventing the production of 
cereblon caused limb defects 
in chickens and zebrafish, sim­
ilar to those caused due to tha­
lidomide. The scientists also 
discovered that when these 
organisms contained a form of 
cereblon that could not bind to 
thalidomide, severe limb mal­
formation was not seen even 
after thalidomide was added 
to the embryos.
This discovery has brought 
scientists a step closer to un­
derstanding how thalidomide 
' functions in the body. How­
ever, until a replacement for 
thalidomide is found, it has to 
be prescribed with great care. 
Patients prescribed' to take 
thalidomide are often advised 
to take birth control medica­
tions and to have frequent 
pregnancy tests.

HIV, from A4
34. The model was designed 
to take into account various 
lifestyles including multiple 
partners and irregular con­
dom use among the sample.
The results of current tri­
als by the CDC are due in the 
next few years. The CDC clar­
ified that the public needs to 
understand that PrEP cannot 
be the magic shield to replace 
all other prevention methods. 
“Because PrEP is unlikely to 
be 100 percent effective,” the
CDC said in its statement, “it 
will need to be used in com­
bination with other proven 
HIV prevention approaches.” 
However, the CDC stated that 
PrEP would be a valuable ad­
ditional safety net to those 
who are at a high risk of HIV 
infection. Questions regard­
ing wide applications and 
political hurdles also remain. 
The high costs of antiretro­
viral'drugs pose the difficult 
question of who gets the pri­
ority when there are limited 
resources.
GAME, from A4
very much already a large part 
of life.
Much of this Internet ac­
cessibility is a wise market 
strategy on behalf of compa­
nies. Marketers see the power 
that this game society has, 
and if they know how buyers 
are using their goods, they 
will have a better idea on how 
to sell them.
Interconnectivity between 
companies is becoming com­
mon. For example, becoming 
a fan of Bing on Facebook 
earns a user Farmville points. 
All of these industries benefit 
from that one decision to earn 
points.
Gamepocalypse, however, 
has its downsides. On the one 
hand, it benefits individuals; 
according to Schell, “when 
people observe [changes that 
the games make that impact 
them], they change their be­
haviors for the better.” On 
the other hand, some sectors, 
such as the tobacco industry 
and fast food, might take ad­
vantage of their own point 
incentives and potentially 
endanger individuals’ health. 
The choices, Schell admitted, 
are becoming harder.
Schell currently hosts f a
blog, “Gamepocalypse Now,” examples of Gamepocalypse gave on G4TV. His blog is at
for the discussion of this topic, that they observe, and he also gamepocalypsenow.blogspot.

French ban on veils violates basic religious freedoms
Net neutrality essential
If French President Nicolas 
Sarkozy has his way, wearing Islamic 
veils in France might become illegal.
Sarkozy was quoted in a New 
York Times article as saying that the 
veil is “not welcome in France.” He 
further claimed that such garments 
oppress women and reduce these 
women’s dignity. As of now, no law 
has been passed, and the resolution 
to ban the veil will be debated in the 
French parliament in May. According 
to a BBC article, the ban’s purpose is 
also “for security reasons, to combat 
fraud, and to meet the needs of some 
public services.” However, if the law 
is passed, it will be a stark violation 
of many individuals’ right to freedom 
of religion.
Last week, Wikileaks — a site that 
allows whistle-blowers to submit 
documents anonymously — released 
a video that shows an Apache heli­
copter kill a gathering of unarmed 
civilians in Iraq. The video is a clas­
sified military document that, as the 
name of the website implies, was 
leaked by an anonymous source, ver­
ified by the Wikileaks staff, and then 
published to the Internet.

internship, and we don’t necessarily 
have the option of being picky about 
where it’s located or how much it will 
pay, if it even pays at all.
However, as a recent article in The 
New York Times pointed out, many 
of those unpaid internships that stu­
dents are vying for may actually be il­
legal. The article states that the U.S. 
Department of Labor will begin to 
more strictly enforce the criteria that 
allow an unpaid internship to be legal. 
According to a Guidance Letter issued 
by the Labor Department on Jan. 29, 
there are six official factors that deter­

This isn’t the first time France has 
tried its hand at forcing secularism 
upon its citizens. In 2004, the coun­
try passed a law that prohibited head- 
scarves and veils in public schools. 
For the many French Muslim women, 
the veil is probably not a symbol of 
oppression or lack of dignity; rather, 
it is a way of identifying themselves 
as part of a group of which they are 
proud members.
With nearly 5 million Muslims, 
France boasts the largest Muslim 
population in Western Europe. By 
preventing such a large portion of its 
population from expressing its be­
liefs publicly, Sarkozy is setting a dire 
example in terms of complying with 
fundamental human rights.

within.
Two Reuters journalists were 
killed in the 2007 attack shown in 
the video, but no Freedom of Infor­
mation Act filing from Reuters was 
able to uncover any details about 
the attack. It took the protection of 
anonymity and a report filed from 
an unnamed source to bring out a 
truth that the American government 
would likely have preferred not to 
have been publicized.

tionizing society, if this is the future 
of investigative journalism. This fu­

ing is similar to what Would be given 
at a vocational school or academic 
institution, the training is intended to 
benefit the intern; the interns do not 
take the place of paid employees, the 
employer does not immediately gain 
an advantage from the intern, the in­
terns are not guaranteed a job at the 
end of their training period, and both 
the employer and interns understand 
that the trainees will not be paid.
The above criteria offer fairly strin­
gent and rather unrealistic guidelines 
governing the line between paid and 
unpaid internships. It is difficult to 
come up with a scenario where the 
employer doesn’t benefit at all from 
having an intern work for them. We 
understand that the rules are in place 
to protect those who cannot afford 
to take an unpaid position, but in
Secularism means that a nation 
does not endorse any religion, but it 
does not mean that a nation become 
intolerant of any particular religious 
group. Sarkozy sees the oppression of 
women as a problem furthered by the 
use of veils, but it is surprising that he 
cannot see the bigger problem that 
will arise if this law is enforced.
By passing such a law, thé French 
government will not only incur the 
wrath of the millions of Muslims liv­
ing in France, but also of Muslims 
in other parts of the world. And it 
is not only Muslims who will have a 
problem with this decision — believ­
ers in freedom of religion all over 
the world will find France’s decision 
disturbing.

are open to people with controversial 
information. Not only does this have 
a huge amount of potential power 
to create change by doing it from 
the outside, there is demonstrated 
financial support for the method. In 
the last week, Wikileaks has raised 
$150,000.
Wikileaks has, in just a few years, 
unearthed information from Sarah 
Palin’s Yahoo! account, the corre­
spondence on climate research, and 
570,000 pager messages sent dur­
ing the Sept. 11 attacks. Wikileaks 
deserves the attention it has been 
getting and the respect of people ev­
erywhere who believe information 
should be free.
many cases these unpaid internships 
actually act as “foot-in-the-door” op­
portunities that help to establish and 
jump-start an intern’s career in a giv­
en field.
Although the guidelines govern­
ing unpaid internships are intended 
to protect potential employees, they 
could actually keep interns who are 
qualified and willing to work for free 
from getting a job in a field that sim­
ply is not financially capable of paying 
each and every one of its employees, 
such as journalism or theater. The 
criteria should be revamped to more 
realistically reflect today’s job mar­
ket. They should be clarified to make 
it easy for students and employers to 
know if an unpaid internship is legal, 
and this should be done in a way that 
benefits both interns and their em­
ployers.

The Internet is the future.
We can’t predict how it will 
evolve or what it will do to society, 
but it isn’t going away anytime soon. 
Its growth is astounding. Many 
people rely entirely on streaming 
videos on sites like Hulu to keep up 
with TV shows, not to mention do­
ing constructive work like watching 
Keyboard Cat. Yet many Internet 
service providers (ISPs) want to re­
strict the freedom of the Internet, 
and a recent court decision allows 
them to do just that.
The decision last Tuesday by the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia deals with net neutral­
ity and how the Federal Communi­
cations Commission (FCC) is able to 
enforce it. Specifically, it holds that 
the FCC does not have the author­
ity to stop ISPs from having absolute 
control over their networks. The 
FCC previously ordered Comcast to 
stop limiting traffic on its network.
Net neutrality does not have a 
Single definition, but it generally 
refers to opposition to the practice 
of prioritizing certain types of Web 
content over others. For example, 
companies that oppose net neu­
trality often want to slow down (or 
“throttle”) high-bandwidth content 
that congests their networks.
At first glance, throttling practic­
es don’t seem unreasonable. After 
all, the corporate lawyers claim, the

On March 23, www.gamecrush. 
com opened its virtual doors for a 
public beta. However, minutes later 
the site was down and the com­
pany claimed that the requests had 
overloaded its server capabilities. 
According to the company, they re­
ceived over 10,000 requests in their 
first five minutes of operation. For 
those of you who are unfamiliar 
with GameCrush, the site offers to 
connect “Players” with “PlayDates”
— essentially virtual escorts that 
are paid for their time — over their 
web-based Flash games or on Xbox 
Live — for a fee, of course.
The stereotype of a “gamer” — 
or, in GameCrush’s terminology, a 
Player — is of an unkempt, either 
morbidly obese or woefully emaci­
ated, awkward, socially inept male 
firmly in the 18-35 demographic. 
However, this is simply not true 
anymore. In today’s world of causal 
games and widespread publicity 
surrounding video games — EA’s $3 
million Dante’s Inferno Super Bowl 
ad in particular — the hardcore 
gamer demographic is spreading 
from Mom’s basement to the real 
world. GameCrush’s very existence 
stinks of catering to the lowest com­
mon denominator, and it is clear, 
even from the company’s own press 
material, that they have few aspi­
rations but to sexualize the experi­
ence of playing games in groups. By 
offering a “dirty” or “flirty” experi­
ence — terms quoted directly from 
the company’s March 23 press re­
lease — GameCrush makes it clear 
that the PlayDates are there as little 
more than a virtual escort service.
only people who download this kind 
of high-quality content are software 
pirates or computer enthusiasts. 
These regulations wouldn’t affect 
most people.
Assuming that by “most people,” 
you mean nobody who watches 
Hulu, or sports clips, or CNN video, 
or any of the other rich multimedia 
content available on the Web. As­
suming that you think the way the 
Internet is now is the same way it 
will be for the next decade. Assum­
ing that you think technology has 
reached its saturation point, where 
innovation is no longer needed.
Without net neutrality, ISPs 
will be able to decide what kind of 
content is most important. They 
will be able to slow down websites 
that compete with them. They will 
be able to charge sites to have fast 
transfer speeds, creating a tiered In­
ternet that disallows startups with­
out the money to pay protection to 
an ISP. This is not just hypothetical; 
it is already in business plans for 
telecommunications and cable gi­
ants.
Allowing prioritized Internet 
access and tiered networks will 
do grievous harm to the greatest 
source of knowledge, media, and 
innovation that exists today. It will 
discourage new ideas while promot­
ing outdated business strategies.
The Internet is the future, but net 
neutrality is essential for making it 
a future controlled by users, not by 
corporate greed.

Now, I am not sure if I would 
have chosen PlayDates as the label 
'for the presumably busty women 
waiting to be objectified by hope­
less gamers shelling out $6 to $10 
for a 10-minute window of des­
perate come-ons and fruitless at­
tempts at real conversation — the 
term seems more like something 
an infant’s mother would arrange 
for her nascent offspring. However, 
the company seems to have settled 
upon that terminology. No doubt 
it was chosen in part because of its 
slightly demeaning connotation. In 
addition, the label for the paying 
participants — Player — is an inter­
esting throwback to those of us who 
remember the usage of the word 
“player” as a complimentary term 
for a male who earned the affec­
tion of many females. “Player” does, 
admittedly, have a neutral connota­
tion in the context of video games, 
but this hierarchy adds an interest­
ing connotation to the site as a sort 
of meat market where the Players 
select their PlayDates and then pay 
them for their services.
Were the site not so obviously 
sexist—all of the example PlayDates 
are attractive women and seem to 
be losing in all of the screenshots
— it might be a little more tolera­
ble. It seems like the service, which 
claims to be “designed to appeal 
to male and female gamers alike,” 
has neglected the latter group of its 
supposed market share, unless we 
assume that the only females who 
play video games are lesbians. Per­
haps the service should be oriented 
toward matching gamers with other 
gamers of commensurate skill levels 
or choosing PlayDates who seem 
less like models and more like real 
people.

Abstinence-only education harms teenagers
In a surprising and yet not-so- 
surprising move, the government in 
its new health care bill decided to 
include $250 million in abstinence- 
only education funding.
Why is it surprising? Well, this bill 
is being called a liberal bill and it was 
passed almost solely by Democrats, 
yet it contains perhaps one of the 
most conservative ideas about edu­
cation.
Further, the Planned Parenthood 
website, which seems to be slightly 
out-of-date regarding this issue, 
claims that “President Obama’s 2010 
budget will end funding for ineffective 
abstinence-only programs and 
provide $178 million for evidence- 
based sex education programs 
that prevent teen pregnancy” 
(www.plannedparenthoodaction. 
org/positions/fighting-real-sex- 
education-97.htm).
As a conservative, I’ll be the first 
to admit that I don’t usually support 
Obama’s initiatives, but this one had 
promise. Educating teenagers about 
their bodies and how to protect 
them is a great idea. Instead of fol­
lowing through with this promising 
idea, though, the administration de­
cided to go in the opposite direction, 
choosing instead to provide funding 
for abstinence-only education.
Unfortunately, though, this move 
can’t be all that surprising to anyone. 
For years, the government has been 
providing extra funding to schools 
that promise to teach abstinence- 
only sex education.
Has this solved any of our teen 
pregnancy problems? No. Is it likely 
to stop teenagers from having sex? 
No, probably not.
Regardless of what you tell — 
or don’t tell — teenagers in school
about sex, they will continue to make 
their own choices about their bod­
ies. Since this is the case, and since a 
vast majority (some sources cite over 
70 percent) of teenagers do decide 
to have sex, it is important that we 
teach them about proper contracep­
tion and all of the risks involved with 
making this decision.
In arguing for comprehensive sex 
education in schools, no one is trying 
to encourage teenagers to have sex. 
They don’t need anyone to encour­
age them.
The point of this kind of sex educa­
tion is to inform teenagers about the 
possible risks of being sexually active 
and to educate them about methods 
of birth control and sexually trans­
mitted infection (STI) protection.
Without this kind of sex educa­
tion, we cannot expect teen pregnan­
cy or teen STI rates to decline.
If we do not educate teenagers 
about safe sex, we cannot properly 
protect them from the dangers that 
sex presents. These dangers and risks 
include pregnancy and STIs — in­
cluding HIV/AIDS — in addition to 
possible emotional and psychologi­
cal complications resulting from hav­
ing sex when they aren’t ready.
We cannot go on assuming that 
teenagers won’t have sex because we 
tell them they shouldn’t. That hasn’t 
stopped them before, and it won’t 
stop them now.
Funding abstinence-only educa­
tion programs is a waste of our mon­
ey. Further, it only hurts our entire 
society to allow teenagers to engage 
in sexual activity — including and 
going beyond intercourse — with­
out being aware of how they can do 
it safely.
Some proponents of comprehen­
sive sex education advocate using 
funding to provide teenagers with 
free condoms and other forms of 
contraception, but I think this goes a 
little too far. Schools should not pro­
vide free birth control to their stu­
dents, but they should not withhold
information about contraception 
that might benefit students. This in­
cludes information about where they 
can go to get free or inexpensive con­
traception, like Planned Parenthood 
or other local clinics.
If we don’t teach teens about sex, 
they’ll get their information from less 
reliable sources, like the Internet, 
magazines, and TV. What will they 
learn from these sources? Likely not 
the same things they would learn 
from experts.
Magazines like Cosmopolitan urge 
readers to try out new sex tricks on 
their significant others, and cable 
networks are full of sexual content. 
There are several TV shows that fo­
cus on teen parenthood, both factual 
(MTVs Teen Mom and 16 and Preg­
nant) and fictional (ABC Family’s The 
Secret Life of an American Teenager). 
If teenagers watch these shows in 
lieu of proper sex education, they 
may get the, wrong idea about sex. 
Some of these shows glamorize teen
parenthood in ways that factual in­
formation would not.
Teenagers are going to learn about 
sex and be aware of all of the good 
aspects that these sources will show 
them, but they will be uneducated 
about the risks and possible pitfalls 
of sexual activity.
By keeping the focus on not hav­
ing sex rather than on how to have 
it safely, teen pregnancy rates will 
not decrease as intended. Compre­
hensive sex education would likely 
reduce the rate of teen pregnancy as 
well as the risk of teens and young 
adults acquiring STIs.
Sex is everywhere. Teenagers 
will be exposed to it, whether or not 
we teach it to them. The question is 
where we want them to learn about 
it, and from whom.

Proper nouns allowed in Scrabble? Not on my board
COURTNEY WinEKIND
When I heard that Scrabble was 
ostensibly amending its rules to al­
low the use of proper nouns, my first 
reaction was one of sorrow. I woke 
up to the report on NPR — which is 
of course where any good Scrabble 
player should get his or her news — 
and quickly followed my gut instinct: 
to search on Amazon for the price of 
the Scrabble Diamond Anniversary 
set, figuring that its black tiles would 
adequately mark my eternal period 
of mourning.
It only takes one decision to ruin 
a legacy of greatness, and this would 
be no exception. The game is sold 
in 121 countries in 29 different lan­
guage versions. Worldwide, over 150 
million sets have been sold, and sets 
are found in one out of every three 
American homes. The rules of Scrab­
ble haven’t been changed since 1989, 
and even then it was nothing to get 
excited about: If final scores are tied, 
the game is ruled a tie and each play­
er is credited with half a win. And
now, in 2010, an amendment that al­
lows proper nouns?
I decided that my Scrabble career 
was officially over. Forget about any 
future competitive play.
With the inclusion of proper 
nouns, the pre-eminent word mas­
ters (and yes, they exist — just wait 
for this year’s Scrabble World Cham­
pionships) would likely be a combi­
nation of 13-year-old girls, sports fa­
natics, and comparison shoppers.
Gone would be the days of book­
worms and linguistics masters—how 
can a (slightly altered) dictionary list 
of words compete with millions of 
celebrities, brand names, and sports 
stars with names like Azubuike? 
(That’s a Z, a B, and a K.) And to 
prove my point, I will admit that in 
order to create that last example I 
had to Google “NBA players.”
How can a word like “qat” (a trop­
ical evergreen plant whose leaves 
are used as a stimulant), historically 
recognized for its usage of a Q with 
no U, compete with the never-ending 
list of proper nouns that fit into the 
same category: Qatar, Qantas, Qi- 
monda, and QVC, to name a few.
A spokesperson for Mattel, origi­
nally quoted in the UK’s Daily Mail, 
may make my point better than I
“The new quirks will level the 
playing field.... Experienced play­
ers with a vast vocabulary could be 
equally pitted against players with a 
love of celebrity or football.”
Who wants an even playing field? 
I mean, this is just a matter of mor­
als. “Bedazzle” on a triple word 
score? That’s 57 points, and — obvi­
ously — if someone were to play this 
word, they would just have used all 
of their tiles, which adds a 50-point 
bonus, for a total of 107 points — for 
a word whose definition involves “as 
seen on TV” labels and rhinestones. 
As I said, immoral.
But then the real facts came out, 
reassuring me about my future in 
competitive Scrabble.
Mattel, which owns the rights to 
Scrabble outside of North America, is 
introducing a game called “Scrabble 
Trickster,” which will allow proper 
nouns. The game will include cards 
that allow players to spell words 
backward and steal letters from op­
ponents, among other nontradition- 
al moves.
The game will not be available in 
North America, where Hasbro owns 
Scrabble. Trickster, we can safely 
conclude, will be an unnecessary ad-
dition to an ever-growing list of un­
fortunate knock-offs.
Which means no one cares — 
Scrabble remains unchanged (at 
least for the moment). We book­
worms can continue to collect ob­
scure assortments of words with 
ideal vowel-to-consonant ratios, 
while the 13-year-old girls and sports 
fanatics (a good word in itself for 26 
on a double word) can play Scrabble 
Trickster.
However, I applaud the quick re­
action of the news media (NPR, CBS, 
the BBC, The Telegraph, The Times in 
London, and The Daily Mail, to name 
a few) and revel in the fact that I was 
not alone in my temporary panic-in- 
duced insanity. Millions entertained 
the idea that the addition of proper 
nouns could destroy a long-loved 
and enduring tradition.
Which is precisely why I am proud 
to call myself a member of the Na­
tional Scrabble Association. So don’t 
try to beat my quixotry with your 
Quentin.

Carnival 
promises 
excitement

NICK HARPER
Working on Spring Carnival 
Committee (SCC) has been a very 
exciting and enriching experience. 
SCC delegates its tasks to its 14 sub­
committees, so almost every mem­
ber of SCC is a chair or co-chair. 
Even if it’s your first time working 
on the committee, you’re given a 
fair amount of responsibility. But 
there’s also a lot of support from 
other committee members when 
you need help or just aren't sure 
how something works.
As chair, I watch the big picture 
of Carnival and make sure every­
thing is coming together as needed. 
This includes watching over the 
subcommittees to make sure every­
one is on track, and helping them 
along when they need it. I also end 
up doing some special projects that 
don’t fall under any of the subcom­
mittees.
Despite all of the work that SCC 
does, most of it is meaningless 
without the over 30 organizations 
that build booths. SCC works hard 
to organize the entertainment on 
Midway, the fireworks show, and 
other aspects of Carnival, but a 
large component of what we do is 
to support the Booth competition.
Last Friday, everyone building 
booths moved on to the Morewood 
parking lot with pieces of their 
booths so they can finish building 
them and have them ready to open 
on Thursday. What makes Booth 
amazing is not just the impressive 
design of these structures and the 
thought put into them, but the hard 
work and dedication of all those 
who build booths. Every booth 
that you see on Midway is thought 
up, designed, and built by students 
here at Carnegie Mellon.
Booth is an experience that 
benefits both the people building 
booths and the campus community. 
In the process of building a booth, 
students get a chance to learn skills 
they might not otherwise have, such 
as electrical wiring/framing a wall, 
or other carpentry skills. Booth, and 
the rest of Midway, also provides a 
wonderful experience for everyone 
on campus and all of our neighbors 
to have fun, relax, and enjoy the 
great work put into the booths.
At the very least, I encourage 
everyone to visit Midway this week 
during Carnival. But to get the full 
experience of Carnival, you should 
really get more involved, whether 
you help build a booth, work on a 
Buggy team, or do something else.
If you’re interested in doing 
something for Carnival, but you 
don’t want to build booths, getting 
involved with SCC is a great way to 
participate. If you have any ques­
tions relating to Carnival, send an 
e-mail to sc0v@andrew.cmu.edu.

TENNIS, from A12
fresh from their match earlier 
in the day, the Tartans came 
out swinging only to fall be­
hind the Lords 2-1 after dou­
bles, with the lone win coming 
from the second doubles team 
of junior Bobby MacTaggart 
and Nemerov, 8-4.
Already at a disadvantage, 
the Tartans soon trailed the 
Lords in singles play. Despite 
some intense fighting, five of 
the six singles matches were 
down a set, giving a forebod­
ing tone to the outcome of 
the match. Yet the Tartans 
hung in and rallied to shift 
the momentum. MacTaggart
added the first singles win to 
tie the score at 2-2, followed 
by tremendous comebacks 
from Miller (1-6, 6-3, 6-2) 
and Spero (1-6, 6-3, 6-0) at 
fourth and fifth singles, re­
spectively. Senior James Mu- 
liawan clinched the win just 
15 minutes later, defeating 
Kenyon’s Jeremy Polster 5-7, 
6-4, 6-3.
Spero was ecstatic. “We 
knew the match with Kenyon 
would be a war. It’s always 
close against them. We had 
chances to win three doubles 
but didn’t convert, so we had 
to win four singles. They have 
two of the best players in the 
country, and Coach told us we 
were going to win the match 
if we got one of those top two 
spots.” He added, “We lost 
five first sets but battled back 
at three through five. We were 
just tougher at the end. We 
are really looking forward to 
UAAs at home.”
On a hot streak, the Tar­
tans are looking forward to 
both an increase in national 
ranking and a dual match at 
home against Grove City Col­
lege next Tuesday at 4 p.m.

JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Assistant Sports Editor
The first time I realized 
that ESPN was starting to get 
annoying was when I heard 
the following sentence actual­
ly read aloud on SportsCenter 
after Opening Day 2002:
“His two home runs put 
him on pace for 324, which 
would absolutely smash Barry 
Bonds’ single-season record.” 
The Pirates’ Garrett Jones, 
the Blue Jays’ Vernon Wells, 
and the Cardinals’ Albert Pu­
jols were among those with 
two home runs on Opening 
Day 2010. Jones and Wells 
both homered in their second 
game of the season as well, 
and Wells even homered a
third consecutive day to give 
him quite an opening series.
Time, folks, to hold onto 
your hats, take a deep breath, 
and put away your record 
books. I won’t lie, I’d take a 
homer per day any day of the 
week and twice on Saturday 
(though they never schedule 
doubleheaders anymore). 
Even a homer every other day 
would be nice. But we know 
that won’t happen.
Wells’ projected home run 
pace dropped from 324 to 243 
to 216 through those mon­
strous first three games, and 
after Saturday’s game was at a 
“mere” 129. His performance 
last week will be enough to 
earn him a starting spot in this 
year’s All-Star Game, especial-
starting earlier and earlier; 
mark my words, you will see 
the word “VOTE” splattered 
all over MLB.com come next 
week, perhaps earlier. Re­
member, folks: This time it 
counts.
Any baseball fan old 
enough to remember 2006 
will recognize the name Chris 
Shelton, most recently of cut- 
from-the-Astros-in-spring- 
training fame. Shelton began 
the 2006 season as Detroit’s 
starting first baseman and 
took the American League 
Central by storm, becoming 
the first AL player ever to hit 
nine homers in his first 13 
games. He received a plethora 
of early All-Star votes as ev­
eryone in baseball wondered 
who this guy was and where 
he came from.
Turns out he came from 
right where he ended back 
up that very July: the minors. 
He ended up hitting only 16 
homers, with 102 hits and 107 
strikeouts.
Wells, Jones, and Pujols 
should all have impressive 
numbers come the end of the 
season. After down years in 
2008 and 2009, Wells seems 
to have regained his power 
stroke at least for now and will 
probably end up around 28 to 
34 homers and right around 
100 runs batted in. Albert Pu­
jols will always be King Albert 
and there is no reason that 
he won’t one day win a Triple 
Crown. Jones will probably 
keep up pretty consistent pro­
duction, but the league still 
has a bit of time to fully figure 
him out. I still expect a break­
out season overall, even if he 
finishes it with another team
— he is on the Pirates, after 
all, where no one succeeding 
is ever safe.
Short hops: Speaking of 
the Pirates, wins on Monday
their first 2-0 start since 2007. 
They then lost their next two 
games before winning Satur­
day to clinch at least a .500 
mark in their first week of 
play. While it isn’t quite the 
Royals’ 9-0 start to the 2003 
season, it’s something. The 
Mets are already partying like 
it’s 2009, leaving a combined 
28 runners on base in their 
three losses through Saturday 
It was a somewhat even 
start to the year, as only one 
team — the San Francisco Gi­
ants — had a perfect record 
after only four games.

take advantage of these op­
portunities and win,” he said.
The Tartans hit the links 
just three days later to host 
the Carnegie Mellon Invi­
tational at the Longue Vue 
Country Club.
With a favorable home- 
course advantage, the Tar­
tans did in fact outshoot their 
opponents to take first place, 
beating out second-place 
St. Vincent College by three 
strokes with a final tally of 
306.
Lee once again led the 
Tartans to a first-place finish. 
This time he was followed 
by Cheng, who shot just one 
stroke back at 73. Einhorn
carded a 78 to finish ninth 
overall at the invitational. 
Cannaday shot an 83 on the 
day, while Discoll finished 
scoring for the Tartans with 
an 89.
Four other Tartan golfers 
also competed at the tourna­
ment. Seniors Nick Burkhold­
er and Adam Klein placed 
ninth and 12th, carding 78 
and 79, respectively. First- 
year Steven Nguyen knocked 
off an 83, while sophomore 
Alexander Cohen finished 
just four strokes behind with 
an 87.
The men’s golf team also 
hosted the annual Edward 
Jones Shootout, at The Links 
in Apollo, Pa., and placed 
third.

Staffwriter
This past week, the Carn­
egie Mellon women’s tennis 
team, ranked 10th in the na­
tion in Division III, took on 
two tough opponents on their 
home courts. On Easter Sun­
day, the Tartans took on num- 
ber-13 rival Johns Hopkins 
University in what proved to 
be a strong win for the Tartans. 
Just a few days later, the Tar­
tans clashed with the women 
of the University of Pittsburgh 
in a friendly scrimmage to pre­
pare for the upcoming UAA
Championships.
After watching the men’s 
team defeat Hopkins in an 
upset, the women were set to 
take the court on a beautiful 
day. Firing on all cylinders, 
the Tartans wasted no time 
establishing themselves in this 
match.
The doubles team of junior 
Ashley Herrick and sophomore 
Laura Chen overpowered their 
opponents at first doubles by a 
score of 8-2. Not long after, the 
third doubles team of junior 
Jennifer Chui and sophomore 
Cze-Ja Tam was victorious by 
a score of 8-6. Sophomore
Courtney Chin and first-year 
Alexandra Tapak, at second 
doubles, completed the sweep 
by taking their match by a 
score of 8-6.
Staked to a 3-0 lead from 
doubles, the Tartans looked 
to be in good shape going into 
singles play. However, the Blue 
Jays rallied and closed the 
gap, as the Tartans suffered a 
quick loss at sixth singles and 
a devastating three-set loss at 
second singles. The Tartans 
responded quickly, notching a 
key win at fifth singles by Tam 
to make the match 4-2. Play­
ing at first singles, Chen de­
livered the deciding match by 
coming out on top by a score of 
6-2,6-2. With the day already 
won, the Tartans lost at third 
and fourth singles, both in de- 
ciding-match tiebreakers.
Coming off a victory, the 
Tartans were confident go­
ing into their scrimmage with 
the University of Pittsburgh. 
With a multitude of spectators 
looking on, the Tartans fought 
hard in doubles, but dropped 
two out of the three to go 
down 2-1. The doubles team 
of Tapak and Chin recorded 
the lone win with a score of 
8-5.
Needing four out of the six 
singles to win, things were 
looking bleak for the Tar­
tans. Carnegie Mellon quickly 
dropped two singles matches, 
putting them in an almost in­
surmountable 4-1 hole. Wins 
at second and fifth singles by 
Chin and Tam, respectively, 
gave the Tartans some hope 
with two matches to go. How­
ever, a tough loss at first sin­
gles sealed the deal and led to 
the Panthers topping the Tar­
tans by a score of 6-3.
Although it was only a 
scrimmage, the players fought 
hard and viewed this match
as a learning experience. “I’m 
glad we played such a strong 
Division I team,” Chen said. 
“It will really help prepare us 
for our huge UAA tournament 
coming up, in which we’ll play 
some of the best teams in the 
country.”
The Tartans will next com­
pete at the Ugg Champion­
ships, held at Case Western 
Reserve University April 16-
18, in the hope of capturing a 
regional title.

Race day predictions
BUGGY, from A12
smells of a deficiency in the 
mechanic department, and 
this, along with their absence 
of seasoned pushers, will put 
them at third place. Fringe 
has shown nothing but a 
solid year, rolling well and 
constantly making me double 
check my stop watch. Look for 
Fringe A to improve on their 
time from last year, but only 
slightly, to get second place. I 
don’t expect a sub-2:07 from 
them. SDC has not made mis­
takes this year, and in first 
place this year will be their A 
team. Expect a sub-2:03 time, 
as they have shown signifi­
cant improvement within the 
past two years, and according 
to the times I’ve been getting, 
this trend will continue.
Expect a weekend of speed 
and hazards, and be sure to 
check out the three-buggy 
start on Hill 1. Thanks to the 
freshly-paved Hills 1 and 2, 
it’s bound to make things in­
teresting going into the free 
roll.
Well, that’s all I have for 
this year; good luck to all the 
teams. I can’t wait to see this 
year’s races, but you’ll never 
notice me.

and finished in 15:04.89.
The next day at the quad 
meet, the women came out on 
top of a close match, scoring 
one point over Westminster to 
win the meet. First-year Lisa 
Rising made her mark by fin­
ishing third in the 1500-me­
ter run in 5:48.86, while 
teammate junior Courtney 
Baker won the 800-meter run 
with a time of 2:20.43. In the 
400-meter run, senior Diane 
Mattingly pulled through for 
the ladies with a third-place 
finish in a time of 1:10.49. In 
the 100-meter dash, sopho­
more Ivana Moses pulled out 
a third-place finish with a time 
of 13.48. In the 100-meter 
hurdles, sophomore Luci Laf- 
fitte stole third in 16.72, while 
in the 400-meter hurdles, se­
nior Crystal LeePow also came 
in third in 1:10.29.
LeePow was followed
closely by teammate first-year 
Leila Bouabdellaoui, who took 
fourth in the event in 1:10.98. 
Sophomore Christine War­
ner stole the spotlight in the 
5000-meter run, where she 
placed third in 19:44.81.
Moses continued to domi­
nate the field, where she won 
both the long and triple jump 
with distances of 5.19 meters 
and 10.58 meters, respective­
ly. Sophomore Lisa Marion 
Garcia also impressed when 
she won the pole vault, clear­
ing 2.80 meters. First-year 
Carissa Iannone left an impact 
on the scoreboard when she 
placed third in the hammer 
throw with a distance of 24.58 
meters.
As for the men, senior 
Chris Rizzo won the 3000-me-

while Titus took first in the 
100-meter dash in 11.47 and 
second in the 200-meter dash 
in 23.24. In the 1500-meter 
run, first-year Evan Gates 
managed third in a time of 
4:10.03, while first-year Ben 
Finch turned heads when he 
earned his first win in the 
5000-meter run in 16:29.78. 
Finally, the Tartans placed 
first through fourth in their
trademark 800-meter run, led 
by sophomore Rob Morhard, 
junior Justin Kurp, junior Dan 
Addis, and junior John Brigug- 
lio with times of 1:57.92, 
1:58.32,1:59.48, and 1:59.74, 
respectively. !
On the field, senior James 
Hulley once again came 
through by winning the shot 
put and setting a new school 
record, with a NCAA provi­
sionally qualifying distance
of 16.61 meters. Hulley also 
won the discus throw, clear­
ing a distance of 45.41 meters. 
Graduate student Chris For- 
nataro took the spotlight in 
the hammer throw, winning 
the event in 49.97 meters, 
while Hulley placed second 
in the event in 44.05 meters. 
In the long jump, sophomore 
Ryan Kissel earned third with 
a 6.59-meter clearance, while 
junior Pat O’Brien took sec­
ond in the high jump with a 
height of 1.85 meters. In the 
pole vault, senior Chris Bridg­
man took second in 4.55 me­
ters, while junior Dustin Mus- 
selman placed second in the 
javelin throw, clearing 53.03 
meters.
Hulley was satisfied with 
his performance. “I’ve been 
fighting a hip flexor injury for 
a few weeks, so I was a little 
worried about discus,” he said.
“While I’m still lifting heavily 
and throwing minimally, this 
season I’ve been improving 
steadily and threw a lifetime 
best this past weekend. With 
our outdoor schedule, the time 
between UAAs and NCAAs is a 
great opportunity to focus on 
one event instead of all three.” 
Look for the Tartans as they 
compete next against West­
minster College on Saturday, 
April 17.

four rowers: senior Brian Ae- 
bersold and first-years Bren­
dan White, Juan Medina, and 
Oscar Chahin, rounded out by 
first-year coxswain Josh Har­
vey. “It was a good race. We 
worked hard and outlasted 
the other crews,” Harvey said 
after the race.
The women’s varsity A-boat 
also took first in a 2000-meter 
race. This boat consisted of 
rowers junior Emily Lesinski, 
sophomore Liz Mahaffa, first- 
year Paige Wilson, and junior 
Claire Herdeman. Sophomore 
Gabbi Coloyan coxed for the 
boat.
Tartan rowing also had an 
admirable finish in the men’s 
varsity 2000-meter race, plac­
ing second after reaching the 
finish line in 6:37. The four- 
man boat consisted of juniors 
Jonah Coste, Justin Perry, 
Sean Lubner, and Andrew 
Kojzar, with junior Nadja 
Yacker coxing for the Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon also sent 
a women’s pair to Philadel­
phia to compete in the 2010 
Murphy Cup Regatta. In the 
heat of battle, the two-person 
boat rowed strong and raced 
into.first place for their divi­
sion, crossing the line with a 
time of 8:13.
The boat consisted of se­
niors Megan Larcom and Al- 
yssa Fogel.
The team’s recent successes 
can be attributed to the mem­
bers’ strong work ethic. The 
crew team trains twice a day 
and is out on the Allegheny 
River in the evening. To pre­
pare for the races, members 
practice almost every week­
end; they practice steady-state 
rowing, sprints, intervals, 2nd 
race training.
The crew team looks to up­
hold its good performance for 
next week, when the team will 
be heading to Camden, N.J. to 
compete in the Knecht Cup.

The Carnegie Mellon row­
ing team showed considerable 
strength on April 3 at the Mar­
ietta Invitational in Marietta, 
Ohio. The tournament was 
held on Muskingum River,
which runs besides Marietta 
College. Although they have 
never raced on these waters 
before, the Tartans blasted 
past competitors, putting two 
boats in first place.
The men’s novice A-boat

race. The boat consisted of

Men’s tennis takes 
trophy at GLCA Invite
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports Editor
Last weekend, the 11th- 
ranked Carnegie Mellon 
men’s tennis team took home 
the crown at the Great Lakes 
Colleges Association Tourna­
ment, overcoming the sev­
enth-ranked Kenyon College 
and two other schools along 
the way.
“I can’t say enough about 
how big this win is,” senior 
Jon Spero said. “We are defi­
nitely one of the hottest teams 
in the country right now.”
Entering the tournament 
as the second seed, the Tar­
tans had high expectations 
going for them. After receiv­
ing a bye in the first round, 
the Tartans faced Calvin Col­
lege in the quarterfinals. The 
Tartans easily put down the 
Knights 5-0 without drop­
ping a set.
After sweeping doubles, 
first-year Duke Miller closed 
out his match at the fourth 
singles position, 6-2, 6-1, 
followed by fellow first-year 
Civan Orhan, who won 6-0, 
6—4.
In the semifinals, the Tar­
tans encountered slight re­
sistance against number-15 
Kalamazoo College. Doubles 
play went fairly quickly; the 
Tartans swept doubles again, 
this time only dropping a 
combined seven games to 
give themselves a 3-0 lead. 
Without missing a step, the 
Tartans charged full steam 
ahead in singles, with junior 
Alex Nemerov beating his op­
ponent at first singles, 6-0, 
6-2.
Adding two more wins to 
complete the six points were 
Miller, who overcame his op­
ponent 6-2, 6-0, and Spero, 
6-4, 6-3.
“Kalamazoo is a top-15 
team who plays very good 
doubles, so I think that shows 
the level we played at only 
surrendering seven games,” 
Spero added. “It was nice to 
have that cushion because 
we had some guys struggling 
physically in singles.”
For the final round of the 
tournament, the Tartans 
went head-to-head against

After leading the past 
several tournaments for 
the Tartans’ golf team, 
senior Chris Lee hopes to 
place in the top 10 dur­
ing the remaining two 
tournaments of the sea­
son. Moreover, Lee notes 
a team goal of repeating 
the conference title at 
the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) tour­
nament at the end of this 
month. Last season, Lee 
was an UAA Individual 
Champion and was giv­
en First Team All-UAA 
honors, while also tak­
ing part in the team’s 
first trip to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Asso­
ciation Championships.
Luckily for Lee, the 
strong academics at Car­
negie Mellon were paired 
with an up-and-coming 
golf team when he was
making his decision on 
where to go to college, 
leaving this school a 
positive choice for him 
overall. Despite a lack 
of extra time between 
golf and schoolwork, Lee 
has been a part of the 
AB Concerts Committee 
and the Undergradu­
ate Financial Associa­
tion, and he is currently 
involved with Mortar 
Board Honor Society, 
which concentrates on 
serving the community 
at large. With an interest 
in different types of food, 
Lee cites having a multi­
tude of favorite cuisines, 
ranging from Korean to 
Italian to Brazilian.
After graduating this 
upcoming May, Lee will 
use his business degree, 
with a focus in finance, 
from Tepper to join Citi- 
group’s Capital Markets 
Origination group in 
New York City. Although
he is a native of Los 
Angeles, Lee seems 
to have found a suc­
cessful niche in the 
Northeast and hopes 
to maintain golf as 
a main part of his ac­
tive life as he pursues his 
business career. As for 
some parting words to 
his fellow undergradu­
ate teammates, Lee said: 
“My advice to the under­
classmen is to be diligent 
about everything you do. 
Succeeding in golf and 
academics isn’t so much 
about your talent; rath­
er, it is about how well 
you prepare and manage 
your time.”

The Carnegie Mellon golf 
team kicked off a busy week 
by shooting 316 in consecu­
tive rounds to take eighth 
at the two-day, par-71 Mid- 
Atlantic Regional hosted at 
the Hershey Country Club in 
Hershey, Pa.
During the tournament, 
the Tartans were led by se­
nior Chris Lee, who recorded 
the top score of 157. Just be­
hind him was junior Brent 
Driscoll, who shot 158, fol­
lowed closely by sophomores 
Terence Einhorn and Michael 
Cheng, who carded 159 and 
160, respectively. Rounding 
out the five-man team was
senior Brett Cannaday, who 
finished five strokes behind 
Cheng with 165.
“Unfortunately we didn’t 
play as well as we can, and our 
performance on the greens 
really let us down,” Einhorn 
stated. “There were some 
positive signs from all our 
players, but the tough holes 
on that course really got the 
better of us. This Thursday 
we are playing on our home 
course, where knowing the 
course well is a gigantic ad­

outlook for the future. “I look

Special to The Tartan
Greetings, Buggy lovers. 
Carnival is around the corner, 
just in time for my carefully 
calculated analysis and pre­
dictions.
This year has been an in­
teresting one at best. After the 
snowstorm that shut down 
Carnegie Mellon, leaving only 
two and a half weekends of 
practice before Truck Week­
end, this spring has been more 
accident-prone than any in 
recent history. With a freshly 
paved Hill 1 and 2, look for 
the fastest freeroll times we’ve 
seen in years.
Given the number of ac­
cidents and incidents, along
with four new and seem­
ingly unproven buggies roll­
ing around the course, we’re 
set for what may turn out to 
be one of the most surprising 
years yet.
Starting with the women: 
Look for Fringe A’s usual lack 
of speed in the feminine de­
partment to squeeze them 
into a sixth-place finish. On 
the other side of that coin, 
look for SPIRIT A’s mechani­
cal incompetence to slow 
down their speedy women for 
a fifth-place finish.
You’ll see SDC B use their 
buggy to put them in a solid 
fourth place. PiKA will slide 
into third place just behind 
an up-and-coming SigEp A, 
whose buggy program is re­
ally making a push as of late. 
Of course, SDC A’s speed and 
technological, advantage will 
place them way ahead of the 
pack, but don’t expect them to 
set a new* record like they did 
last year.
For the men, it looks to be a 
race for second, but let’s start 
at the back of the pack. Expect 
to see SDC push three buggies 
to day two, with SDC C com­
ing in at 10th, somewhere 
around the 2:15 mark. Assum­
ing PiKA B doesn’t crash in the 
Chute, expect inexperienced 
pushers and driver to land 
them in ninth on day two, if 
only because of the buggy.
As a dark horse this year, 
CIA A will come in at eighth 
with a rigid push bar that
should allow them to give 
their pushers a chance and fre­
eroll times this spring that are 
keeping them competitive.
We’ll see Fringe B show up 
with a sub-2:15 time to pull off 
seventh, being slightly edged 
out by SigNu A, who has shown 
faster freelroll times than usu­
al but still leaves a lot to be 
desired in the pusher depart- 
ment.SigEp A will follow up 
their surprising advancement 
in speed from last year with a 
fifth-place finish, behind SDC 
B at fourth, whose push team 
would outclass the majority of 
A teams in the field.
Now for the top three. PiKA

Last weekend, the Carn­
egie Mellon track and field 
team was met with back-to- 
back action. On Friday, April
9, the distance runners com­
peted in Bucknell University’s 
Bison Outdoor Classic in 
Lewisburg, Pa. The follow­
ing day, the Tartans hosted a 
quad meet of their own, com­
peting with Penn State Uni­
versity Behrend, Washing­
ton & Jefferson College, and 
Westminster College. The 
women won the quad meet, 
while the men ended up tak­
ing second place.
“I’m pleased with the times 
I’ve run this season because 
the whole program is still 
new to me,” first-year Noel 
Titus stated. “I’m still getting 
accustomed to the more de­
manding schedule collegiate
athletics require and the con­
ditioning techniques of our 
coaches. I think this meet 
was a success for the Tartans 
because everyone stepped up 
and used the competition to 
motivate themselves.”
He added, “Across the 
board, our guys and girls j 
were giving each event their 
all.”
At Bucknell, Carnegie 
Mellon runners impressed 
the competition with several1 
top finishes. In the women’s 
1500-meter run, junior Laura 
McKee took fourth place in 
4:53.44, while junior Nate 
Bussiere snagged second in 
the men’s 1500-meter run, 
two seconds behind the lead­
er with a time of 3:56.79. Se­

Jangle-pop takes over Mr. Small’s
The Dum Dum Girls and Girls bring new sound to Pittsburgh
To an unprepared passerby, the marquee of 
Mr. Small’s Theatre & Funhouse might have 
suggested that the venue was hosting some sort 
of twisted feminist convention when, last Monday 
evening, Millvale played host to two spectacular 
bands — Girls and the Dum Dum Girls.
Girls, an indie rock group from San Francisco, was 
thrown into fame When the band's debut album, 
Album, was rated as the 10th best album of 2009 by 
the popular music critique website Pitchfork Media. 
Often described as the shoegaze jangle-pop rebirth 
of the Beach Boys, Girls is currently signed with 
Matador Records and working on content for their 
sophomore release.
With all the hype that has been surrounding Girls in 
the 2009-2010 year, one wouldn’t expect the.group 
to be so easily upstaged by it’s opening act. The 
current members of the Dum Dum Girls, originally 
formed by front woman Kristin Gundred (stage name 
Dee Dee) in 2008 as a solo project, came together 
to record their debut full-length album I Will Be, ' 
released March 30.
As the Dum Dum Girls are often criticized for the 
monotony of their lo-fi "blissed-out buzz saw” sound, 
those involved in the production of I Will Be intended 
to increase the likability of their sound while 
maintaining the genius of Dee Dee's songwriting 
and without compromising her creative voice. 
Producer Richard Gottehrer, who has worked with 
revolutionary girl bands like Blondie, the Go-Go's,

and just recently the Ravonettes, successfully 
managed to do just that.
Those who chose to show up for the opening act last 
Monday were blown away by the spectacular sound. 
Lo-fi distortion took a second hand to Dee Dee’s 
incredible vocals, and the set list flowed easily from 
start to finish. After this incredible and unexpected 
performance, the audience was no doubt eager to 
see if the headliner, Girls, could top it.
Sadly, Girls didn’t quite earn the pedestal they 
had been placed on. It wasn’t that Girls played a 
particularly bad show; but bluntly put, they didn’t 
blow listeners away. They began the show with a 
slow and calming song and maintained this relaxed 
ambiance throughout their set. While the band did 
incorporate some random spurts of loud and heavy 
distortion within the set list, nothing about their 
performance was markedly high-energy. Those 
expecting to experience the fun and fattening feel 
of songs like “Lust for Life" and “Morning Light" 
would have been disappointed with the band’s live 
rendition.
Although the show may have failed to meet the 
expectations of those audience members prepared 
to hear the “10th best album of 2009," it was still 
a set packed With talent. Lead singer/guitarist 
Christopher Owens did a spectacular job on 
vocals, and the songs themselves maintained that 
psychedelic quality that initially made the band’s 
debut album so popular.
While the set Girls played live seemed to be vastly 
different from the tracks on their album, the show 
was definitely enjoyable and worth watching. Be 
sure to catch Girls and the Dum Dum Girls on their 
U.S. tour, or the next time they visit Pittsburgh.

Tales from abroad: Australia
One writer recalls his exciting experience traveling by bus across the Australian continent
The following is an excerpt from public policy and 
management master's student Ryan Donnelly's blog 
account of his travels in abroad. Feel free to visit www. 
postcardsfromstrangeplaces.com if you would like to 
read more.
Being fortunate enough to have traveled across the six 
or seven continents this world has to offer, I like to think 
that I’ve seen a thing or two. But I knew that this journey 
was going to be one for the record books when the 1985 
short bus pulled up at 6 a.m. and I saw the man behind 
the wheel. With the glare of the rising sun radiating 
off of his dark black sunglasses, a smiling, sunburned, 
mustached man was finishing off what appeared to be 
his third Red Bull of the morning.
Half asleep, I threw my bags into the attached trailer and 
climbed aboard. Five minutes, later, my prior estimation 
was confirmed. Laughing hysterically, Mark sped off 
driving the wrong way down a one-way alley, honking 
at a cab that was trying to use the street in the generally 
accepted manner, and running the bus down the road 
with two wheels on the sidewalk.
We were departing for a seven-day journey into the 
outback, and the driver Mark (pronounced in Aussie 
as "Maahck”) couldn't have been more pleased. This 
was exceptional, considering we were departing for a 
two-day, 1500-mile drive due north over mostly unpaved 
roads into arguably the single most inhospitable place oh 
the planet. Armed with a head full of knowledge, an evil 
laugh, and a matching green-fatigue army shirt complete 
with some well-worn shorts that were so small that I 
felt uncomfortable being on the same street as him, 
the 50-plus-year-old road warrior rocketed his rattling 
steed off into the desert. And wow, could that bus move. 
Exhausted, I was slipping in and out of a light sleep 
to the sound of an odd mix of techno and disco-fused 
tracks playing from his iPod when I was jolted awake by 
our vehicle lurching violently to the right and our bus 
passing a smaller.car on the shoulder, right as a road 
train (think tractor trailer with two to five additional 
trailers attached) swerved past us. Everyone else woke 
up looking as if half of them had wet their pants, and so
I asked:
“Everything all right up there, Mark?"
He turned down the music and looked up into the 
rear-view mirror and smiled, saying, “You bet, mate!
No dramas (pronounced draaah-maz) — I reckon we’ll 
survive (suh-voyve) this drive (droyve),” and with a 
hysterical, evil laugh he turned around completely 
to spend more than a few seconds peering at his 
passengers, without once slowing down or looking at 
the road. Mark then turned back to face the stereo and 
realized the bus was heading straight towards a large 
boulder. Artfully, he turned the wheel to the left and 
guided us back onto the road, as if this was as normal as 
brushing your teeth. I looked down and searched in vain 
to find something with which I could fasten myself to the 
chair or floor in the absence of seatbelts.
A few hours later, and the shouting began once again 
as Mark said, “We will be stopping up here a ways, so 
you all better (bettah) use the toilets and get some water. 
Two liters. Minimum. Three is better. Because after that, 
we’re in the land of big hats, big heat, and big flies. You 
won't be finding any more shade or toilets out here, 
mate. Where we’re going, it’s just us and the outback. 
Something happens, and it will be at least eight hours 
(owas) before a plane will be able to get out here, find 
you, and get you back to a hospital. At least eight hours, 
mate. And that's if the dingos don't get you first." And 
with that customary laugh, he adjusted his big straw hat 
and looked forward again, realizing that the bus was still 
speeding down the road.
When we stopped, Mark filled up the bus with gas, and 
then filled two extra containers as well. Just in case 
we ran out. The heat was over 100°F, and it wasn’t 
even noon. Plus, we had only entered the desert an 
hour or two before. I ran inside the station and came 
out with a Snickers bar. I started chatting with Mark 
and asked him about where he grew up. He said that 
he grew up on a station just like the one we were at.
A station, he explained, is different from a farm. A 
station is entirely self-sufficient and is called so because 
it is much larger than any farm is. The outback, he 
explained, has a fair number of them — the biggest of 
which is larger in size than Belgium and has somewhere 
between 60,000-70,000 heads of 
cattle, many of which
have never seen
a human being before. When it comes time to round 
them up, station-heads have to use helicopters.
Many of these remote outposts also have a gas station, 
but the primary business is often sheep or cattle farming. 
Generally, only one or two families live on a station, 
hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of kilometers away 
from the next-nearest station, town, or city. Mark and his 
eight brothers and sisters grew up with only each other 
and a handful of aboriginals that worked on their land 
with them to keep company. They got their education 
from School of the Air, which were half-hour school 
sessions that took place over radio broadcast three 
times per week. Children all across the outback would 
tune in during those times, and after the broadcast 
could ask questions via radio. Homework assignments 
were written and mailed to the school to be graded and 
eventually returned. The first time he saw a TV was 18 
years ago.
Mark spent a lot of his youth reading and working on 
the land. Additionally, having grown up with many 
aboriginals, he knew a lot about their history and 
customs. He explained some of the expert survival 
tactics in the punishing outback heat that had been 
passed down through generations. These people 
survived for thousands of years in some of the hottest 
places on earth, where there is virtually no water or 
shade, living off extremely scarce resources. Australia 
is the driest continent on the planet. Eighty percent 
of it is desert, and the country is the same size as the 
U.S. When I say that going through the outback is big, 
hot, and remote, I mean it. The heat can get in excess 
of 140°F, and the road temperature can get over 150°F, 
melting the pavement.
After two days of driving and a night spent' in the middle 
of the outback sleeping under the stars — taking turns 
keeping watch at night to keep the dingos away — 
we arrived in Coober Pedy — the Opal Capital of the 
World. It’s a place so hot and desolate that much of their 
population of 2000 lives underground in what they call 
“dugouts." A community of miners, they fashion their 
homes in the same manner they make their mines. We 
slept underground, too.

Talent grows in the family tree PaPerhouse
Jakob Dylan follows in the musical footsteps of his father travelin9 music
When fathers and sons enter the same professions, 
there’s a natural and — hopefully — friendly 
competition between them. Thé father usually paves 
a path to follow, and the son is challenged to meet 
and exceed the feats established by his dad. Now, 
substitute Bob Dylan in for the father, and imagine 
yourself as his son. Can’t be an easy job, can it? How 
exactly does one live up to — and surpass — one 
of the men who shaped the face of music? Jakob 
Dylan, now 40 years old and still working, embraces 
the relationship. His newest solo album, Women and 
Country, was just released on April 6, and Jakob has 
a good chance of stealing his father’s fans.
His latest release might best be described as the 
soundtrack of a snake charmer in St. Louis. With 
Middle Eastern influences and muted trumpets, it’s 
a beautiful hybrid of differing genres that can't be 
found anywhere else.
The opening track, “Nothing But the Whole Wide 
World,” really sets the tone for what the remainder 
of the album will feel like. It’s a beautiful and gentle 
easing into the journey Dylan is about to take his 
listeners on. It gives the audience a chance to get 
acquainted with his heavy voice and his layered 
lyrics.
"Down Our Own Shield” features the angelic 
backing vocals of Neko Case and Kelly Hogan in 
harmony with Dylan’s smoky tones. It's a touching 
ballad about staying strong in a fight, and the music 
complements the lyrics magnificently. A strong 
musical intro soon invites the male and female 
voices to sing against a steady background beat.
The standout song is “Lend a Hand." The song as 
a whole is reminiscent of an old-time circus, while 
Dylan, like an eccentric ringleader, recounts a story 
to his audience in poetic verses and clever rhymes. 
The song begins with heavy rhythmic drumbeats, 
like the introduction of a tamed elephant entering 
the ring. Accompanied by a blaring trumpet and 
electric guitar riffs, Dylan sings, "Suppose I quit you, 
my wayward tribe, whatever would you do? Now . 
take me to Hades, or take me to Memphis, just don’t 
take me for one of you.”
If you can picture a movie scene of a band of men 
crossing the Sahara with a large sun setting behind 
a mountain of sand, “We Don’t Live Here Anymore” 
would be the soundtrack to that moment. Singing 
about a forgotten town that’s gone to shambles, 
Dylan takes breaks to allow for the instrumentation.
“Everybody’s Hurting” again welcomes Dylan and 
his female vocals joined in beautiful harmony.
Here, the background violin joins the prominent
pungi — the instrument of snake charmers, with a 
sound like a cross between a bagpipe and a kazoo. 
Dylan writes of promises and dreams as kids, 
telling a story and remarking, “How sweet salvation 
sounds.”
Jakob’s voice in "Holy Rollers for Love" is scarily 
similar to his father’s in the opening verse, and the 
lyrics could definitely pass for something out of 
Bob’s songbook. Here, Jakob sings about symbols 
of peace among times of war ("Battle songs fill their 
lungs”).
If you don’t listen closely, it’s pretty easy to go 
through the album in its entirety thinking you’ve 
listened to the first track on repeat 11 times. 
However, if you look at'the lyrics — which are 
Dylan’s undeniable strong suit — or think of each 
song separately, you’ll find there are a good deal of 
gems among what seem like just echoes.
One thing that's for sure is that there is creative 
musical talent in the Dylan blood. Jakob not only 
wrote all the lyrics'to the 11 songs on his new album, 
but he composed the music and arrangements as 
well. These Middle Eastern-meets-folk compilations 
are great if you’re feeling quirky or want to hear 
some quality lyrics.

17th Street Café provides a little taste of Italy
Head down to the South Side for an intimate dining experience on East Carson Street
Venture over to the historic South Side of Pittsburgh, 
and you will soon be astounded by the diversity of 
establishments that this neighborhood provides. The 
streets are lined with restaurants and shops for all 
different tastes. While you can get a tattoo on one block 
and have a drink with a date on the next, don’t forget 
that the South Side is also known to have some of the 
best food in the city.
Off East Carson Street, there is a little restaurant that 
might catch your eye with its bright yellow umbrellas 
and simple name: the 17th Street Café. When customers 
walk in the door, they are always greeted with a smile 
and a hello — and if they happen to be regulars, they 
are more likely than not greeted by name and asked 
about their families. The intimate atmosphere and the 
size of the café, with an estimated seating occupancy of 
around 40 people, make it easily recognizable. While the 
walls are as bright as the umbrellas outside, the lighting 
indoors is at the perfect level to create a very personal 
experience while still allowing for an easy read of the 
plethora of options on the menu.
The café serves Italian cuisine, but by no means are their 
dishes plain old spaghetti-and-meatballs meals. The 
menu has a varied selection of appetizers, pasta, poultry,
Maricel Paz | Production Co-Manager
ArldH ,Lc crl ?,Lcr ?sbl I,v W,ol wvllz' Wtvsuf ,Lc­
b,,v bsusuf ec crl .7cr ?cvllc AeIéx x
seafood, and even veal options. The pasta dishes come 
with a house salad that can be topped with your choice 
of dressing. The poultry entrees are served with your 
choice of soup or salad. Entrees start at around $15. and 
go all the way to $27. Appetizers are less than $10.
All food is made to order, meaning that it is easy to 
add or remove anything from an order as long as the 
ingredients are present in the kitchen. In a sense, 
everyone has the potential to be his or her own chef for 
the night.
A great way to start the meal is with zucchini planks: 
lightly breaded slices of zucchini fried and served with 
marinara sauce and lemon. The portion is large enough 
to tower over the plate, but the zucchini itself is light 
and delectable. (For those on a budget, there’s a coupon 
for $7 off on an appetizer. Just visit the café's website 
before venturing over.) It was surprising to see that the 
portion sizes of the entrees weren't the size that an 
Italian grandmother might force on you, but they were 
large enough. The restaurant keeps enough food coming 
to the table that by the time entrees are served, finishing 
a meal seems difficult. The sausage and pepper ravioli 
provides a kick of spice: The raviolis themselves are not 
stuffed with the traditional ricotta cheese, but instead 
are filled with a paste of cheeses and Sicilian sausage. 
The chicken prosciutto is also very good, served over 
your choice of pasta and cooked in a creamy sauce. The 
servers also make sure to keep customers satisfied with 
a constant supply of warm bread throughout the meal.
Desserts are brought out on a platter and cover a variety 
of options, including cheesecakes, cobblers served with 
ice cream, and freshly made cannoli, all of which have 
tempting flaky golden crusts and creamy toppings. All in 
all, a meal is under $25 after using the coupon.
The experience doesn't end just because dinner is over. 
When the check is brought to the table, it comes with 
pens. The pens read, “Bring this stolen pen... back to 
17th Street Café for a free order of Fried Zucchini...”
— a good way to bring customers back. There is also 
a rewards program that sends members gifts and 
discounts for just about every holiday and special 
occasion that the owner can think of, including his wife's 
birthday!
If you are looking for a place to have a nice dinner 
with the family or a place to take your date, the 17th 
Street Café is the place to go. They have something 
for everyone. Looking for a place to have an intimate 
gathering with a large group of friends? There’s a 
separate section in the back that can seat around 15 to

20 people. If you’re a sports fan — and let’s face it, most 
Pittsburgh residents are — don't worry about missing a 
game. There is a large-screen TV above the bar, which 
has a varied selection of wines and beers for patrons’ 
drinking pleasure.
Whether you’re looking for a place to feel like home or 
to impress a date, the 17th Street Café has it all: the 
great service, the varied menu, the friendly atmosphere, 
and the intimate feel. This is the kind of seemingly 
hole-in-the-wall restaurant that once discovered, you 
won’t want to share for the fear of losing it to popular 
demand. It is a place that you will want to go back to 
again and again, with friends, family, significant others, 
and just about anyone. It is a place where there won’t 
ever be a shortage of smiling faces greeting you at the 
door.
Maricel Paz | Production Co-Manager 
The 17th Street Café is located at 75 S. 17th St.

Booths spring up as Build Week begins
Students come together in the Morewood parking lot to construct and decorate
their various Greek houses or the cages to Midway to 
begin Build Week. However, booths aren’t just thrown 
together during Build Week — Carnival contenders 
begin construction of their booths long before Carnival. 
Whether it be painting, preparing decorations, or 
actually working on the solid wooden structure that will 
come to support hundreds of onlookers during Carnival 
week, participants have to be well prepared — they 
simply will not be able to put their booth together if they 
wait until the last minute.
The process itself is absolutely fascinating to watch.
Over the course of a couple of days, students work 
nonstop to erect massive wooden structures whose 
creative designs are all unified under a common theme. 
"It’s such a spectacle," said a first-year electrical and 
computer engineering major Ryan Salvo. “My friends and 
I have been watching their progress from the Morewood 
E Tower lounges; it’s amazing that they get the booths 
up so fast!"
This year’s theme is “History with a Twist," and Booth 
contenders are going all out. Some booths will feature 
local sports teams, some will track the lives of notable 
Pittsburghers, and-some will embody our favorite Disney 
movies. Whatever the theme, this year’s booths wiH be 
sure to please!
Carnival will feature a ton of events worth attending, so 
make sure you try to go to as many as possible. Turn to 
pages B8 and B9 to plan your Carnival experience with 
The Tartan’s Midway map and major events calendar.

The annual clearing of the Morewood parking lot is the 
easiest way for students at Carnegie Mellon to tell that 
spring has truly sprung. This was certainly the case 
when, last Friday, students began transporting their 
large unfinished wooden structures across Morewood 
and Forbes Avenue to the asphalt clearing. This 
was Move-On, the beginning of Build Week, and the 
beginning of a series of days dedicated to preparing 
booths for Spring Carnival.
Although it’s a loud and difficult process, for students, .. 
Move-On symbolizes the coming of Carnival, warm 
weather, and the end of the semester. For those who 
are unfamiliar with it, Move-On is the process during 
which Booth contenders transport their structures from

Real music, new sound
Songs from movie and TV soundtracks top the charts
As you browse the music on iTunes, you may have 
noticed the increasing popularity of movie and 
television soundtracks. Some of them have even 
been so brave as to invade the Top 10 Albums chart 
on iTunes. What is this new phenomenon?
Well, it really comes as no surprise that Glee: The 
Music, Volume 1, and Glee: The Music, Volume 2 
have landed top spots on multiple music charts.
Both albums have also been certified gold by the 
RIAA. The show won the 2010 Golden Globe Award 
for Best Television Series —- Musical or Comedy. 
What makes this show so incredibly popular? It 
could be the stereotypical high school roles played 
by lead characters, or the underlying good versus 
evil tension between the geeky members of the glee 
club, the popular cheerleaders, and their leaders, Will 
Schuester and Sue Sylvester. But, more importantly, 
it’s the music that makes the show, and there is no 
doubt that Glee has a stellar soundtrack. With pop 
and show tunes, it’s a perfect mix of fun, new takes 
on songs often heard on the radio, and great classics.
Indie music has also made a surprisingly popular 
entrance into the world of soundtracks. Perhaps 
the rising popularity of indie films has something to 
do with this trend. One such recent hit soundtrack 
is that of 500 Days of Summer. The film has been 
nominated for many awards, and it made numerous 
“Top 10" year-end lists for 2009, and having a great 
soundtrack didn’t hurt. The music pushed the film 
forward, sometimes providing background themes 
while at other times was the highlight of the scene. 
When Tom first meets Summer, she comments on 
his choice of music: The Smiths. In another scene, 
aftei»Tom finally sleeps with Summer, the film adapts 
the techniques of musicals, where Tom dances
through a park singing "You Make My Dreams” 
by Hall & Oates and people in the park join him in 
song. When their relationship reaches the pinnacle 
of happiness, Summer and Tom wander the city and 
all conversations and noise are muted while "Sweet 
Disposition" by Temper Trap is played. The movie 
does a wonderful job of highlighting the songs it 
uses, making the soundtrack a hit.
Another indie film that has garnered a lot of 
attention is Juno, the popular 2007 film that won a 
2008 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay 
and was nominated for three other awards. The 
featured music is a perfect match for the film. The 
soundtrack is certified platinum, and peaked at 
number one on U.S Billboard 200. It won the 2009 
Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack 
Album for Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual 
Media. When the director had asked Ellen Page, who 
plays Juno, what kind of music Page’s character 
would listen to, she suggested The Moldy Peaches. 
Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches became the 
key behind the music, as many of her songs were 
featured in the film. The sound of the film was 
free-spirited and jangled — not always perfect, but 
with character, a reflection of Juno's personality.
The similarity that all hit soundtracks feature is their 
ability to perfectly match the film or TV show in 
which the songs are used. Music provides a mood, 
be it tension, happiness, or easy-going. Although 
popular films may boost their soundtracks to 
prominence, it’s really the music that makes the film.
