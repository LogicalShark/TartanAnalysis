Fire alarms investigated
By D. A. HENDERSON
Tartan Business Manager
In the past three weeks, there have 
been twelve fire alarms on campus. 
According to Chief Jim LaPaglia of 
Campus Police, this is not an unusual 
number. LaPaglia says, “Many of the 
alarms can be explained, but some ap­
pear to be in the system.” It is the bugs 
in the system which have top Carnegie 
Mellon officials worried.
The abundance of fire alarms has 
come to the attention of William Elliot, 
vice president for enrollment, who 
watches students evacuate More wood 
Gardens from his Warner Hall office. “I 
just raised the issue,” said Elliot, “I just 
want them [Environmental Health and 
Safety] to make sure the system works.”
The CMU Department of Environmen­
tal Health and Safety (EHS) is respon­
sible for all testing and maintenance of 
fire alarm and smoke detection sys­
tems on campus.
According to Pete Collopy of EHS, 
“Elliot is really putting our feet to the 
fire, so to speak.” The systems used to 
follow-up and repair the fire alarms are 
currently being evaluated. “We are try­
ing to come up with a better follow-up 
system. We have a system for repairing 
the fire alarms. We send a work order 
to Physical Plant. When they process 
the work orders, fire alarms go to the 
top, but there really is no immediate 
flag for fire safety equipment.”
The fire alarm systems are tested 
once a month in accordance with Pitts­
burgh ordinance, says Collopy. “There
is a schedule for testing every build­
ing every month ... we trigger the 
alarm and check the electronic sys­
tem.” According to Collopy, no one 
walks the hallways to check each 
individual alarm unless the system 
indicates a problem, but he also said, 
“At least in some areas the volume of 
the horn is not to our standards.” 
The standard, set by EHS, is 70 
decibels in occupied areas. Physics: 
Principles and Problems by Murphy, 
et. al. describes 70 decibels as “nor­
mal conversation” in a decibel scale 
measuring ths relative loudness of 
sounds.
In addition to problems within the 
system, EHS is also concerned about 
problems caused by people who

important and lasting contributions 
to this institution in every position 
he’s held here.”
Maloney’s achievements in the Ath- 
letics Department include thebest win/ 
loss record in men’s basketball since 
1926, the first President’s Conference 
championship in any sport, and a 99 
percent graduation rate.
Muloney also raised alumni involve­
ment to record levels in University
activities and financial contributions.
His most recent work has been with 
Development, where he increased the 
total gifts to the University from $30 
million in 1989 to $46 million in 1991.
In his statement, Maloney said, 
“Carnegie Mellon is a world-class in­
stitution because of the people who 
work together within this community. 
I have enjoyed immensely being a part 
of that community and wish all of my 
colleagues continued success.”
Funds misused by CMU
“We are confident that scrutiny from 
agencies will be withstood. ”
—Vice President for 
University Planning Patrick Keating
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Diversions Editor
On January 30, USA Today 
published a front page article 
concerning several universities’ 
misuse of government funds. 
According to the article, the De­
fense Contract Audit Agency 
(DCAA) found that CMU used 
$287,000 for commencement 
activities instead of research.
In response, the University 
has issued a statement denying 
any intentional wrongdoings. 
The statement not only ad­
dresses the government funds 
problem, but other recent prob­
lems CMCJ has had with DCAA
According to DCAA reports,
CMU “charged $287,000 for com- 
mencementactivities.”Thisflaw 
in CMU’s records for the year 
1987 was blamed on a clerical 
error.
“The error in the commence­
ment costs was made three or 
four years ago. We don’t know 
who did it,” said Patrick Keating, 
CMU’s vice president for Uni­
versity Planning.
In order to prevent such er­
rors from happening in the fu­
ture, the University will be mak­
ing some changes.
“We’ve tried to tighten proce­
dures. Costs are now catego­
rized. We have a new computer 
system to deal with it, etc.,” said 
Keating. “We are confident that 
scrutiny from agencies will be

Trustees approve ’92 tuition rate
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan News Co-Editor“Much of the additional tuition rev-Tuitionrises by 4.9 percent
enue will be used for student finan­
cial aid. The University admits stu­
dents solely on academic or artistic 
ability....”
— President Robert Mehrabian
University President Robert 
Mehrabian released a letter to 
the campus community last 
week which announced that the 
Board of Trustees has set un­
dergraduate tuition at $16,000 
for next fall.
The 1992 tuition rate is a 4.9 
percent increase over the cur­
rent tuition of $15,250, and is 
the lowest percentage increase 
since 1975, when the university 
did not raise the cost of tuitioij.
The tuition increase was down 
from a rise of 8.9 percent last 
year. The dollar amount is also 
the lowest since the 1981 in­
crease of $700. The 1990-91 tu­
ition change was the highest at 
$1250.
According to Vice President
for Enrollment William Elliott, 
the smaller increase reflects the 
troubled economic times of the 
nation. “The operation of the 
University is going to be cur­
tailed,” said Elliott, pointing out 
that faculty and staff salary in­
creases will not be as large as 
previous years. “Increases are 
going to be in line with tuition,” 
said Elliott.
However, the University has 
plans to use the additional funds 
from the increased tuition in a 
number of beneficial ways. In 
the letter released by 
Mehrabian, he says, “Tuition 
revenues will also be used to 
fund initiatives aimed at improv­
ing the undergraduate experi­
ence at Carnegie Mellon.”

Another area in which the 
University would like to main­
tain its financial commitment is
aid to undergraduates. Accord­
ing to the statement by 
Mehrabian, “Much of the addi­
tional tuition revenue will be 
used for student financial aid. 
The University admits students 
solely on academic or artistic 
ability without consideration for
their ability to meet educational 
costs. Our policy of meeting the 
full financial need of each stu­
dent also continues. These poli­
cies are crucial to building a 
community of the most talented 
students from diverse back­
grounds.”

Possible cancer 
drug discovered
CHICAGO, Feb. 7 (AP)—A 
simple, inexpensive new test 
has led to the isolation of a 
powerful anti-cancer drug and 
a safe, natural pesticide from 
the paw paw tree, sometimes 
called the “Indiana banana,” 
said researcher Jerry L. 
McLaughlin of Purdue Uni­
versity.
The cancer drug, which has 
so far been tested only in ani­
mals, is one million times as 
potent as the widely used can­
cer drug Adriamycin, he said.
The National Cancer Insti­
tute has expressed interest in 
the drug and has begun its
own tests, McLaughlin said 
at the annual meeting of the 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science.
The pesticide, a chemical 
cousin of the anti-cancer drug, 
could be used by greenhouses 
and truck farms and could be 
worth as much as $500 mil­
lion a year, McLaughlin said.
The paw paw is a shrub­
like tree with edible fruit 
shaped like bananas, which 
grows across the eastern U.S. 
The substances McLaughlin 
identified are found through­
out the tree, but mostly in 
twigs and small branches.
Bush introduces economic bills
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (DJ)
— The House Republican lead­
ership, as expected, introduced 
a recast version of President 
Bush’s economic growth pack­
age that would be financed pri­
marily with dubious accounting 
reforms.
The plan, embraced by the 
White House, is built around 
the president’s proposed cut in 
the tax on capital gains as well 
as a number of business and real 
estate investment incentives.
Significantly, the bill rejects 
several tax increases, some of 
them on credit unions and the 
life insurance and securities in­
dustries, which Bush had sug­
gested in his fiscal 1993 budget 
as offsets for the package’s cost.
A letter to the Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski [D-Ill] Reps. Rob­
ert Michel [R-Ill] and Bill Ar­
cher [R-Texas] said the presi­
dent does not now support new 
taxes.
“The president believes—and 
we strongly agree with him — 
that economic growth does not 
require higher taxes for any 
Americans,” the lawmakers 
wrote.
White House Budget Director 
Richard Darman said in a letter 
circulated on Capitol Hill that 
the recast package enjoys the 
administration’s full support. 
“We in the administration be­
lieve that this approach makes 
sense,” Darman wrote. “It al­
lows focus on a short-term pack­
age that will stimulate growth, 
is fully financed, and is thor­
oughly manageable.”
The package’s growth incen­
tives are estimated by the ad­
ministration to cost about $4 
billion over six years. They would 
be offset by a handful of “sav­
ings” initiatives, including im­
posing certain accounting re­
forms on the Pension Benefit 
Guarantee Corp., the govern­
ment sponsored entity backing 
private pension plans, and by 
extending the Treasury’s author­
ity to collect defaulted student 
loans.
House Budget Chairman Leon 
Panetta [D-Calif] denounced the 
plan as inconsistent with the 
administration’s oft-stated goal 
of fiscal responsibility.
Panetta, in an interview, de­
scribed the financing plan as a 
recipe for higher deficits, but 
said Democrats as well as Re­
publicans will have a difficult
time voting for it. “When faced 
with the choice between a tax 
and a gimmick, members will 
choose a gimmick every time,” 
Panetta said.
The tax-writing House Ways 
and Means Committee, headed 
by Rostenkowski, is scheduled 
to begin drafting economic 
growth legislation next week. A 
committee aide said the GOP 
package is unlikely to be sup­
ported by Rostenkowski, who 
intends to use the president’s 
original growth package—taxes 
and all — as a starting point for 
action.
Democrats say they will draft 
legislation that not only revives 
United States business activity, 
but provides middle class tax 
relief financed by higher taxes 
on the wealthy.
Japanese, US workers compared
TOKYO, Feb. 7 (AP) — Of­
fering its contribution to the 
debate over whose workers 
are more productive, Japan’s 
Labor Ministry said that by 
some measures American 
workers outproduce their 
Japanese counterparts.
The ministry divided the 
1989 U.S. gross domestic 
product by the number of 
workers in each country and 
found that American work­
ers produce 1.62 times more 
than Japanese.
Ministry official Yasuo
Kuwashima said the study was 
done at the request of Labor 
Minister Tetsuo Kondo, who rec­
ommended that such figures be 
released following controversial 
remarks by Japanese politicians 
about American work habits.
According to the Labor Minis­
try, Americans surpassed the 
Japanese in terms of productiv- 
ity-per-hour partly because of 
the longer hours Japanese em­
ployees work. The average Japa­
nese worker put in 42.3 hours a 
week in 1990 compared with 38.2 
hours for U.S. workers.
But when productivity is 
calculated taking into ac­
count the monitary exchange 
rate, American workers.only 
produced 95% as much as 
their counterparts in Japan, 
it said.
“Whether a nation’s work­
ers are diligent or not is not 
directly linked with produc­
tivity,” Kuwashima said. “No 
matter how hard-working 
Americans may be, if machin­
ery at their plant is 20 years 
old for instance, they are not 
going to be too productive.”
Bush considers phase-out of 
ozone-damaging chemicals
Defense workers assistance considered
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (AP)
— Faced with the certainty that 
two million Americans will lose 
their defense jobs in a post-Cold 
War era, Sen. Sam Nunn [D-Ga] 
chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, described 
an assistance program that could 
put them to work.
Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney told Congress last week 
that by the middle of the decade, 
about one million civilian and 
military employees will be out of 
work. The Defense Budget 
Project estimated last August 
that more than 800,000 defense 
companies’ employees would lose 
their jobs by 1996, Nunn noted.
Those estifria'tes were calcu­
lated before President Bush an­
nounced his plan to slash mili­
tary spending by $50 billion over 
the next five years.
Among the proposals are early 
retirement for those with 15-20 
years of military service, addi­
tional retirement credit for those 
who work in fields like educa­
tion, health care or law enforce­
ment, and retraining of military 
employees for civilian jobs.
Nunn pointed out that 60 per­
cent of military officers have 
bachelor’s degrees while 35 per­
cent have a masters or doctor­
ate. Nunn proposed a teacher 
certification program, making it
easier for military employees to 
work in education. Military em­
ployees without degrees could 
work as administrative assis­
tants in schools with discipline 
problems, Nunn suggested.
To finance the early retire­
ment plan and additional retire­
ment credit, Nunn cited the sav­
ings from the early retirement 
provision. He called on the De­
fense Department to manage an 
economic transition program for 
civilian workers who are laid 
off. Nunn also called for more 
economic assistance.
The Pentagon plans to reduce 
its forces by about 25 percent, or 
about 500,000 jobs.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (DJ)
— The Bush administration is 
likely to support a faster inter­
national phase-out of ozone-de­
pleting chemicals in the wake of 
new data indicating the prob­
lem is worse than it believed, 
The Wall Street Journal re­
ported.
“President Bush is very con­
cerned about ozone depletion 
and takes seriously the recent 
scientific discovery that it is 
worse than we thought,” said 
Environmental Protection 
Ag-ency Administrator William 
Reilly. “I expect that the admin­
istration, which is currently re­
viewing the information, will 
support moving up the phase­
out schedule for various ozone- 
depleting chemicals by three, 
four, or in some cases, five years. ”
Earlier this week, the National 
Aeronautics and Space Admin­
istration released scientific find­
ings that showed record levels of 
such chemicals over northern 
New England and eastern 
Canada. The data suggested an 
increasing likelihood that an 
ozone hole will develop over 
densely populated areas in the 
Northern Hemisphere. In recent 
days, senior White House offi­
cials have been discussing what
to do in response to the data.
The U.S. is already commit­
ted, under an international 
treaty, to a phase-out schedule 
for the production of chlorofluo- 
rocarbons, which are used as 
refrigerants and solvents, and 
other chemicals that destroy the 
stratospheric ozone layer. Un­
der the 1990 amendments to the 
Clean Air Act, the EPA can speed 
up the phase-out if new data 
indicate a need to do so. The 
ozone layer is crucial for shield­
ing the Earth from ultraviolet 
radiation, which leads to skin 
cancer and crop damage.
Officials cautioned that dif­
ferences remain within the ad­
ministration over whether to 
speed up the phase-out and how 
fast.
Bolstering the case for an ac­
celeration is that producers of 
the chemicals support the idea. 
The U.S. is already ahead of the 
treaty’s requirement that pro­
duction be ended by 2000. Kevin 
Fay, executive director of the 
Alliance for Responsible CFC 
Policy, a coalition of users and 
producers of CFCs, said that 
most production of CFCs could 
be ended by 1996. “The transi­
tion to substitute products for 
new equipment is going well,”
he said.
Moreover, there is consider­
able support among European 
countries for a faster phase-out. 
In April, a group of countries 
that have signed the treaty will 
meet in Nairobi, Kenya, to work 
on revisions with the hope of 
completing the efforts before a 
November meeting in 
Copen-hagen.
Even before the release of the 
NASA data, environmental 
groups had been pressing the 
EPA to order an accelerated 
phase-out, and they are pushing 
for faster action than the indus­
try supports. “The science clearly 
demands that we be finished 
with these chemicals as rapidly 
as possible,” saidDavidDoniger, 
senior attorney at the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. The 
council is calling for an end to 
CFC production by 1995.
In addition, the industry wants 
to be allowed to retain some CFC 
production to service existing 
equipment, while the council is 
pushing for a full phase-out.

paglia said, “There are too many fire 
caused by carelessness.”
’ollopy categorized many of the ways 
system is triggered that are not 
¿lems within the system: “Students 
the system trying to test the 
Jke detectors with small fires, alarms 
set off by steam from showers, or 
meone will be cooking something in a 
crowave and create a lot of smoke or 
jam-”
3f the 12 alarms between January 
md February 6, all but two could be 
tributed to a specific cause. LaPaglia 
id “It [the number of alarms] is too 
jny. If the alarm goes off because of 
eam or smoke that means the system 
pits, but we are concerned about the 
hers."
biggest concern over the large 
unber of both explained and unex- 
ained alarms is that students are 
¡lingto evacuate the buildings. Cam­
as Police, under orders from the Pitts- 
irgh Bureau of Fire, has begun check- 
gbuildings for people who don’t leave 
ring alarms.
Paglia said, “This is the first time 
anrecallthat we have cited students, 
is a real safety hazard.” Elliot
said, “When an alarm goes off we ought 
to leave. When we don’t leave we jeop­
ardize ourselves, certainly, but also the 
firefighter that has to save us.”
The fine a CMU citation for failure to 
evacuate carries is $50, but the Pitts­
burgh Bureau of Fire could decide to do 
the sweep of the building itself. If it 
does, according to Pittsburgh regula­
tions, the fine to students would be “no 
less than $100 and not more than $1,000 
for each and every offense, plus costs.”
Captain Bob Friel of the Pittsburgh 
Bureau of Fire said the monetary cost 
of coming to CMU for a false alarm is 
about $1000 for each response. But 
worse, he says, “It takes 16-18 men to 
respond to CMU on a first alarm. So it 
takes those men out of service for a 
period of time.... The 18 Engine Com­
pany responds and that leaves Squirrel 
Hill residential homes unprotected. The 
second thing is that is you assume ev­
ery alarm is a fire and you travel above 
the speed limits and this creates haz­
ards.”
On Saturday, February 1 at 11:42 pm 
Campus Police issued internal citations 
to Michael De La Cruz and Daniel 
Sommer for failing to evacuate their 
room in Resnick during the fire alarm. 
During the same fire alarm Campus
Police took the names of 16 other stu­
dents who did not evacuate the build­
ing; the students, who did not receive 
citations, will be contacted directly by 
Student Affairs, according to the secu­
rity report.
De La Cruz said he and his roommate 
Sommer couldn’t hear the alarm. “In 
our room, the walls are thick and there’s 
only a box in the suite corridor, a big 
box, but it sputters.” De La Cruz later 
reported the broken alarm to East Side 
Area Coordinator David Potter.
The security report says that in many 
rooms that were not evacuated “the fire 
alarm horns had been taped or other­
wise made inoperative.” De La Cruz 
responds, “They said it [our alarm] had 
tape on it, but we didn’t know anything 
about it. I didn’t even know where the 
alarm was.”
De La Cruz said he is appealing the 
citation. De La Cruz and Sommer will 
be meeting with Potter some time later 
this week.
Housing is very concerned about this 
incident and other similar incidents. 
When asked how Housing will handle 
the citations, Potter said, “No decisions 
have been made; it is still under 
consideration, but it is a serious prob­
lem.” Potter said, “There is going to be
"Safety and security are primary areas of 
importance and we need to know students 
will leave [during a fire alarm]. We are ready 
to do whatever it takes to make sure stu­
dents are safe."

David Potter
a communication to students about the 
importance of evacuating.”
Other students, including Roy 
Sandberg, who also live, in the new 
dorm, say the alarms are too quiet or 
inoperative. Sandberg said, “The first 
time the alarm went off last semester, 
we didn’t know what it was. You can 
hear it when you’re awake, but it is just 
a background buzz. You wouldn’t hear 
it if you had music on.”
One student in the West Wing did 
leave during a fire alarm on Sunday 
February 2. When he left he didn’t lock 
his door, and when he returned, $2450 
worth of stereo and video equipment 
was missing. LaPaglia says, “It is un-
fortunate that this happened.” He goes 
on to explain what you should do when 
you leave for a fire alarm: “When you 
leave, lock your door and take your key. 
Also turn on your lights, so the fire 
department knows you’re out. Don’t 
lock your door if your room is involved 
in the fire.”
Though the problems are trouble­
some, Collopy says, “We know where 
we are headed—our number one prior­
ity is fire safety.” Potter went even 
further, “Safety and security are pri­
mary areas of importance and we need 
to know students will leave. We are 
ready to do whatever it takes to make 
sure students are safe.”

Power failure disrupts 
campus computers
A brief blackout or “brownout” hit Oakland and 
part of Shadyshide at 8 pm on Saturday. The 
power failure caused three main servers to go off 
and network problems for the CMU campus.
It took time to reboot the servers, but there were 
still problems with the network on the third floor 
of Wean Hall where the three main servers are 
located. The servers were brought back online, 
but the network problems on the third floor made 
them “invisible” to the campus. The result was the 
isolation of certain networks from the rest of the 
campus. It took approxiamtely two and a half 
hours to repair.

SPECIAL INTEREST HOUSES
The four Special Interest Houses in the Margaret Morrison Complex are 4-bedroom, 8-person 
apartments. The three Special Interest Suites in Resnik House are two 8-person houses will 
include 3 double rooms and 2 single rooms; and one 7-person house consists of 3 single rooms 
and 2 double rooms. While all 8-person houses include 2 bathrooms, the 7-person suite has 
just one bathroom. As a result, the 7-person house must be occupied by members of the 
same sex. The Margaret Morrison houses include a kitchen and living room. The Resnik Hall 
suites do not include a kitchen. In order to be eligible for consideration for a Special Interest 
House, a student group must have at least eight members (seven in the case of the house 
in Resnik), and two alternates.
The specific goal of the Housing Office in providing the Special Interest Houses is to encourage 
situations where the living environment complements the learning opportunities or the 
residents involved and where specific educational goals outlined by the member-residencs are 
understood and enhanced.
If more than 7 groups of students submit applications for these Special Interest Houses, a 
decision will be based on a comparison of the educational goals presented and the likelihood 
of serious educational benefit being derived from residency in this type of living situation.
Application forms are available in the Housing Office and must be filled out and returned by:

withstood.”
Carnegie Mellon’s statement also deals with 
the issue of the DCAA uncovering “$44,000 in 
unallowable costs, including a ‘cruise down 
the Nile River” in January of 1991. The Uni­
versity claims that costs of an educational trip 
for architecture were not included in the 
University’s “research overhead to the federal 
government.” According to the Carnegie Mel­
lon statement, the trip was considered an 
instructional expense. “This trip was sup-
ported through special tuition paid by stu­
dents who participated,” the statement reads.
In addition to its problems with the DCAA, 
Carnegie Mellon is currently waiting to back 
$25 million from the federal government. This 
reimbursement comes from research overhead 
costs.
“We are pursuing it [recovering the money]. 
The process takes place every year. Auditors 
audit expenses. Actual expenses exceed $25 
million. The government is four years behind 
in audits. It’s a slow process,” said Keating.

Task forces 
finalize plans
By MIKE LIPPERT
Tartan Personnel Manager
As of January 21, all but 
two of the task forces under 
the direction of the Commis­
sion for Undergraduate Edu­
cation had met and submit­
ted status reports to the Com­
mission’s chair, Dr. Erwin 
Steinberg, vice-provost for 
undergraduate education.
The Commission, which was 
formed last September under 
an initiative by University 
President Robert Mehrabian, 
is intent on assessing and fur­
thering the quality of under­
graduate educational and 
residential life on campus. It 
is currently subdivided into 
ten task forces, each of which 
has been given a directive to 
study, assess, and suggest im­
provements to a particular 
portion of undergraduate life. 
Members of the task forces 
include representatives from 
the administration, faculty, 
and the student body.
To date, the task forces have 
finalized their statements of
purpose and are currently 
submitting progress reports 
to the Commission head. The 
task forces are expected to 
submit concrete plans of ac­
tion to improve the under­
graduate environment by the 
end of this academic year.
Mehrabian and Steinberg 
have expressed their commit­
ments to the success of the 
Commission. Pilot projects 
currently being developed by 
Commission members should 
be in place as early as next 
semester with continued fi­
nancial and administrative 
support to sustain them.
The Commission is an on­
going committee — as cur­
rent task forces complete 
their studies, others will form 
and take their places. The 
Commission intends to con­
tinually review and reassess 
the undergraduate environ­
ment on campus.
Students are encouraged 
to participate in and share 
input with the Commission 
task forces.

a powerful combination to help 
stop urgent problems in our 
community from growing.

FORUM
Students sizzle over 
campus fire safety
Most everyone is familiar with 
the frustration and annoyance of 
leaving a warm dorm room dur­
ing a fire alarm. Most everyone 
also knows that most of the 
alarms do not signal real fires. 
William Elliot, vice president for 
enrollment, and the Department 
of Environmental Health and 
Safety (EHS) have been trying to 
find out why the alarms go off as 
often as they do.
Until a solution is discovered, 
EHS and the Carnegie Mellon 
community must take on certain 
responsibilities to deal with this 
problem.
EHS must find a system to deal 
with broken alarms and inad­
equacies with the Resnick and 
West Wing alarms. Because the 
University has installed alarms 
only in main rooms of suites or 
halls, residents cannot hear ring­
ing alarms from their bedrooms.
The low volume of the alarms 
also contributes to the problems 
in the new dorms. A dorm usu­
ally has more background noise 
than an average building, so per­
haps 70 decibels, the current vol­
ume, is not loud enough. The 
alarms should be louder to com­
pensate for the extra noise.
Housing must also take more 
responsibility for fire safety. Bat­
teries for the smoke detectors 
should be changed every semes­
ter, but they are obviously not, 
because many batteries die dur­
ing the year. Students are forced 
to ask their resident assistants 
to obtain batteries for them. It
often takes a long time for the 
RAs to get new batteries, since 
there may not be any in RA stor­
age. Any hesitation in repair of 
the fire safety system is unac­
ceptable.
Physical Plant must make nec­
essary repairs on the fire safety 
system immediately. A day is too 
long to wait. Fire safety equip­
ment should be in a repair cat­
egory of its own, which takes 
priority over all other categories, 
including “emergency.” Intricate 
tests of the fire alarms are also 
necessary.
Right now, EHS only checks 
the alarms by making sure a 
lightflashes on a circuit board. It 
doesn’t even listen for the sound 
of alarms when testing, as they 
should.
The final responsibility for fire 
safety falls upon the students. 
When the alarm in a dorm goes 
off, residents should turn off their 
lights, lock their doors, and leave 
the building — it’s a pain and 
probably not a real fire, but risk­
ing death or a $1000 fine for 
failing to evacuate to avoid 20 
minutes of inconvenience just 
isn’t worth it.
RAs should deal with smoke 
detector problems. If the detec­
tor beeps continually,, the bat­
teries need to be changed — no­
tify the RA. Even if the alarm 
goes off at inappropriate times, 
do not disable it. One of these 
days there could be a real fire, 
and that annoying alarm could 
save your life.Ssshhh! Study areas 
lack peace and quiet
It is very difficult for students 
on this campus to find a quiet 
place to study and do homework 
for classes.
Doim rooms have the distrac­
tions of roommates, neighbors, 
and telephones. Students who 
live off campus need places to 
study while on campus.
Theoretically, many places ide­
ally suited to quiet study exist on 
this campus. Unfortunately, for 
those who cannot study when 
there’s noise around them, most 
of these “quiet” places aren’t quiet 
at all.
The library would be the logi­
cal place to go and spend many 
hours of productive study time, 
but that is not always possible. 
Even on the third floor of Hunt 
Library, the “quiet study floor,” 
many distractions make study­
ing, at least for some, virtually 
impossible.
The microfilm machines pro­
duce constant noise and the 
building itself is poorly designed 
for controlling acoustics. In ad­
dition, students ignore library 
rules and talk in the study areas, 
making distracting noise.
The library staff needs to en­
force the quiet rules and try to 
reduce the noise that the ma­
chinery creates in the quiet study 
areas, or move the machines to 
an area where they won’t disturb 
studying students.
Empty classrooms make a great 
place to study when they are 
unlocked. Using classrooms 
when no one else is around, how-

ever, is not safe, especially at 
night.
One excellent study location 
that did exist on campus was the 
Tartan Lounge. The Lounge used 
to be a great space to do home­
work and study. Dorm residents 
had an alternative to their rooms 
and the library, and students 
who lived off campus had a place 
to go while on campus.
Now that the arcade has been 
moved to the area next to the 
Tartan Lounge called the Log­
gia, the space has become worth­
less as a place to study. The con­
stant din of electronic sound ef­
fects and pinball machines has 
ruined what was once a decent 
study atmosphere.
The arcade could be moved to 
some other location in order to 
reclaim the Tartan Lounge as a 
study area.
Another option would be to 
soundproof the Lounge from the 
arcade. Doors could be added 
between the two spaces, and 
soundproofing material could be 
placed between the second floor 
and the Loggia.
The situation in existing study 
areas needs to improve, and more 
areas need to be created for stu­
dents to work undisturbed.
The administration should try 
to find other places on campus to 
designate as quiet study areas. 
There may be rooms in Skibo or 
other buildings that could be used 
for this purpose, but someone 
needs to look closely at the cam­
pus and find them.

Mr. Erik Seligman 
points out that your 
coverage was less Letter to 
than clear, arguing th Edjtor 
thatthose who accuse u,c tUllUI 
him have an “irrational (but completely 
understandable) rage.”
Eric Jefferson is a 22 year-old who 
has a mind that runs like a sewer. 
Using words like “fugly,” “bitch,” “vagi­
nal Americans,” and “dick receptacles” 
for women, and “pussy-wimps” for men 
does not make the job of protecting his 
speech any fun. He appears to have no 
respect for anyone, parades his hatred 
of the CMU community and his ances­
try as a badge. He feels “smeared” by 
someone who placed his writings up 
around campus anonymously, and says 
that “everything I said was justified” by 
this anonymous confrontation.
No, Mr. Jefferson. Having frustra­
tions and anger and expressingthem in 
hostile words does not make your posi­
tion justified. Having your thoughts 
publicized and taking the heat for it 
does not mean you speak the truth. 
Your thoughts are protected; your 
speech is protected. You have not been 
censored, although you whine about it. 
If the community upholds its responsi­
bility to you, where is your reciprocal 
obligation to the community?
Accept responsibility for your sex 
drive and your feelings. You have no 
right to have sex with women on de­
mand. How would you like it if women 
locked up men and only used them as 
semen donors?
Here you are being educated at pres­
tigious CMU. Have you thought about 
all the women you’ve come in contact 
with in your life? Are they all useful 
only as penis receptacles? What about 
your mother—is she a dick receptacle? 
What about your female friends — are 
they nothing but dick receptacles? What 
does that make you? Nothing but a 
dick? Surely you have more potential in 
life than this, Eric!
There is much more to being a man 
than calling people cunts and wimps. A 
child of six can do that! Face your fear, 
face your anger. You don’t get paid for 
being miserable. Nobody who hated the 
world is remembered as a hero. Build­
ing is much harder than destroying, 
loving is much hard than hating. Do 
something really tough!

Vandalism to stadium 
becomes real problem
Editor:
In recent months 
we have seen an in­
crease in senseless 
vandalism in Gesling 
Stadium. During the 
fall, a section of aluminum bleacher 
seats and the supporting brackets were 
unbolted and removed from the area 
used for handicapped seating. At about 
the same time, a number of holes were 
burned in the turf at mid-field, appar­
ently by cigarettes or firecrackers.
Very recently two pieces of the turf, 
within the soccer playing area, were
Vo
Letter to 
the Editor
ripped up and taken. A section of the 
metal rail that borders the track was 
removed. Graffiti is repeatedly spray- 
painted on the doors and walls in the 
public areas under the stadium. Each 
week brings another discouraging in­
stance of damage.
The increasing effect of these destruc­
tive acts is one of premature deteriora­
tion of a fine new facility. It may be too 
much to hope that a small kernel of 
guilt will develop in the minds of those 
individuals responsible.
Any information on this vandalism 
in Gesling will be appreciated. Perhaps 
those of you who enjoy using this facil­
ity will join this department in our 
efforts to counteract this disturbing 
trend.

Lippert draws fire for anti­
vegetarian views
Vo
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I am very disap­
pointed in your fea­
ture about vegetari­
anism [“Debating 
Vegetarianism,” 2/3].
The feature as a whole was a very 
superficial attempt to address the is­
sues surrounding vegetarianism, and 
consequently trivialized it. Moreover, 
much of the information and argument 
presented, particularly by Mike Lippert 
[“Herbivores Need To Think Through 
Their Intentions,” 2/3], was either in­
accurate, incomplete, or blatantly 
misinformative.
Regarding health issues, Lippert as­
serts “a well-trained nutritionist would 
warn most people not to give up meat 
altogether” and “those who abstain from 
all meat, red or otherwise, are often not 
healthy because they don’t know how 
to go about eating sensibly to retrieve 
the lost nutrients.” Both statements 
are completely untrue.
According to the heavily researched 
Pulitzer Prize nominee Diet For A New 
America, by John Robbins, vegetarians, 
and especially vegans, are largely much 
healthier than meat-eaters. They live 
longer lives, suffer fewer health prob­
lems (including sharply reduced heart 
disease and cancer rates), and tend to 
have more endurance, strength, and 
vitality.
Every nutrient that our bodies need 
can be obtained easily from an exclu­
sively plant-based diet. The Physician’s 
Committee For Responsible Medicine 
has revised our “four food groups” sys­
tem to include nothing but plant prod­
ucts (grains, legumes, fruits, and veg­
etables). Meat and dairy products are 
options according to the Committee, to 
be used sparingly, if at all.
Health problems have also been 
linked to the fact that pesticides in 
meats, dairy products, and eggs gener­
ally outnumber pesticides in plant foods 
by a more than 10 to 1 ratio.
It would be appropriate if there were 
an intelligent public debate about veg­
etarianism, since we are attending an 
institution of higher learning. How­
ever, The Tartan’s feature clearly fails 
to do this. It seems as though Mike 
Lippert in particular did absolutely no 
research on the subject.
I think that he should do so, and I
suggest that he (and anyone else inter­
ested) begin by reading Diet for a New, 
America. I would also strongly suggest 
that he refrain from doing any articles 
in the future without researching the 
issue first.
David McWade

Vegetarian cries foul over 
article’s lack of research
Editor:
I am writing to ex­
press my concern
about the misinfor- Letter to
mation that appeared fhg Editor 
in your paper [“Her­
bivores Need To Think Through Their 
Intentions,” 2/3]. The article did not 
provide any factual information about 
vegetarianism and the reasons why 
people become vegetarians.
Lippert’s comments about health fac­
tors and a vegetarian diet are wrong. 
Vegetarians live longer lives and are 
usually prone to less disease and other 
illnesses that face the majority of our 
population (Robbins, Diet for a New 
America).
Lippert fails to adequately explain 
the humanitarian reasons for not eat­
ing meat. Most consumer-bought meat 
is produced in “factory farms,” opera­
tions that consist of hundreds of thou-i 
sands of cattle. The cattle live under 
. cruel, torturous, and inhumane condi­
tions for their entire lives. Most of these 
animals live chained to a wall in a box, 
not allowed to move. This is done so 
that no muscle is formed, thus increas­
ing the amount of meat on the animal.
There are also many environmental: 
issues that were completely ignored in 
Lippert’s article. He fails to mention 
the 2500 pounds of water that it t 
to produce one pound of meat (Robbins, 
Diet for a New America). There is 8 
major water shortage in many parts of 
this country and the entire world; re­
ducing the amount of meat that we as a 
society consume will provide water t 
those regions where it is needed.
The cattle industry is one of the larg­
est polluting industries in the world. 
The Greenhouse Crisis Foundation in' 
Washington has shown that every ham­
burger that is eaten adds 500 pounds of 
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The 
fertilizers that are used in the feed for] 
the animals are made of toxic compo-; 
nents and contribute to over 40 percentj 
of all water pollution in the United 
States (Nature, April 1991). The meth­
ane that comes from cattle and their 
byproducts make up 20 percent of meth­
ane emissions globally (E, January/ 
February 1991).
In conclusion, The Tartan and Lippert j 
were very irresponsible in publishing 
an article that had very little factual; 
content. It is clearly obvious that no 
research was done on this issue by the 
author. If it had been researched, then 
he would have discovered that veg­
etarianism is a safe, healthy, and envi­
ronmentally sound diet plan. I would 
encourage everybody to at least exploit 
the issues and values around the veg­
etarian lifestyle.

Valentine’s Day inspires thought
Jason McDonald
|was always a fan of the way we ran 
Ljentine’s Day back in second grade, 
ve a Valentine to everybody, and t one from everybody. It was very 
lljst, as well as being completely hol- 
} but it worked. Everyone got through 
y jay OK, and only a few people picked 
ton the fact that I wrote the same thing 
I ¿veryone s card.
ifhese days, Valentine’s Day is much 
lore of a thorn in my side. For those of 
ij who go completely on simple surface 
[dgements, I don’t have a girlfriend, but
there’s something more at work here. It’s 
more of an ill will toward an obviously 
futile tradition.
Don’t get me wrong. As cynical as I 
usually am, the concepts of love and ro­
mance do have appeal, mostly because I 
can actually find real-world examples of 
them (unlike honest politicians, for ex­
ample). There are those couples out there 
—I can think of two—that just make you 
scratch your chin and nod thoughtfully, 
because there is your evidence that ro­
mance really does exist.
It’s just that the creation of a holiday 
that gets under my skin, because there 
ends up being a rift between the haves 
and the have-nots. The haves (people in 
relationships) pretend that they care 
about each other more because Hallmark
Cards has fixed costs to cover, while the 
have-nots cringe uncomfortably for 24 
hours (or attempt to sleep through the 
day).
The holiday, in theory, also takes care of 
the lonely, providing for that mythical 
“love at first sight.” Men are supposed to 
take this annual opportunity to attack 
women with flowers just like in that com­
mercial for Impulse body spray (or vice 
versa, this is the PC ’90s). Utter crap 
because that sort of Grandiose Romantic 
Gesture (GRG) doesn’t exist anymore.
Why? There are a lot of reasons. Intimi­
dation is the biggest reason; it’s just not 
fashionable to have any sort of feelings, 
and nobody wants to risk the awkward 
looks that come with public revelation of a 
personality deeper than, “Wow, he/she’s
cute.’’The reaction ofmost people to the 
previous sentence probably just proved 
my point—say the word “feelings,” and 
people look at you like you might pull a 
knife.
Pride is another means of derailing 
the romantic spirit. Open your win-' 
dows on Thursday night and you should 
hear the wind carry the plaintive cries 
of, “but I don’t want to appear desper­
ated The irony is that, considering the 
extent of their lamentation, these people 
are probably the most desperate ones 
out there.
Pride can kill existing relationships 
as well as squash new ones. I’ve also 
seen one of my friends lose his girl­
friend because of his pride — his value

¡February is Black History Month, as 
¦any people may or may not know. This 
lonth gives the black community the 
lance to celebrate and contemplate its 
fiverse and sometimes painful history, 
[very racial and ethnic group has a di- 
ferse history and culture, but just how 
Lortant is it for others to understand 
nd appreciate those cultures, or for that 
latter for the members of the commu- 
fity itself?
I Diversity and multiculturalism have 
een talked about and touted on cam­
puses throughout the country and in vari­
ous social and political forums. Even 
though identification with a certain his­
tory and culture is important to individu­
als, I would suggest that what is more 
important is identification with the larger 
national culture and history. What that 
comes down to is not thinking of our­
selves as African Americans, Italian 
Americans, or Asian Americans, but as 
just plain Americans.
The strength of our country has always 
lied not in our diversity, but in the things 
that we have in common. In many parts 
of the world, namely Eastern Europe and 
the Middle East, there are constant eth­
nic wars that have been going on for 
centuries. We have never had constant 
warring fractions, like many other coun­
tries, despite enormous differences in cul­
tures and racial backgrounds.
The American culture has grown over 
the past two hundred plus years, with 
every group changing and hopefully im­
proving what it means to be an American. 
Heavily influenced by the settlers, the 
American culture has evolved to be unique 
compared to that of any other country 
today, due mostly to the vastly different 
cultures that have been integrated into 
American society.
My background includes seven different 
ethnic groups and the earliest that my 
family’s history goes back in this country 
is 1845.1 have no single culture to identify 
with other than the American culture, yet 
I am considered part of the America that 
has everything. America is supposed to be 
the great melting pot. When my ancestors 
came to this country they eventually be­
came part of the greater American cul­
ture. Why then must certain groups in 
this country push for cultural separat­
ism when all around the world it has 
been the cause of great social destruc­
tion. The melting pot concept has made 
America a strong nation.
American culture is rich with charac­
teristics that many nations admire, or 
at least use to admire. Our history of 
public debate, the American work ethic, 
and the willpower to persevere are just 
a few. Our culture developed because of 
the contributions of many different eth­
nic groups, but it is threatened by the 
splintering of society into distinct cul­
tures.
Many racial and ethnic groups are 
now promoting multiculturalism,

Vegetarian coverage 
criticized by student

•by someone

Vo
Letter to 
the Editor
Lippert [“Herbivores need to 
think through their intentions,” 
2/3] which condemned vegetar­
ians as simple minded was a list 
of famous vegetarians: Da Vinci, 
Thoreau, Socrates, Newton, 
Darwin and Gandhi.
Mike said we vegetarians 
needed to “think through our 
intentions” so that we can “de­
fend our reasons.”
I really don’t see why Mike 
should feel I need to be able to 
justify my personal choice not to 
eat “Tartan Burgers” but, just 
to make him happy, I’ll try.
My rationale for choosing veg­
etarianism is that man has el­
evated his food gathering op­
erations above the natural eco­
logical structure.
The highly processed animal 
that dining service provides 
probably grew up in a cage 
(chicken) or pen (cow) without a 
life aside from chewing and poop­
ing (Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity isn’t that bad—at least we 
work).
No one who goes here is per­
sonally interacting with the eco­
system, we instead rely on the 
structures our forefathers have 
built to provide for us.
I therefore don’t see myself as 
having the right to eat from the 
natural spirit; to victimize the 
other minds which came from 
eating it.
I guess that last statement 
hints at the murky underlying 
issues: the concepts of nature, 
spirit, freedom and such.
Since Letters to the Editor 
have to be 300 words or less, I’ll 
spare you all a philosophic trea­
tise.
Nonetheless, the idea of eat­
ing a creature simply because 
the human species had suffi­
cient intellectual capacity to 
enslave it probably nags a lot of 
people. Maybe even a fascist 
weenie like Mike.
I personally decided to as­
suage my uncertain conscience 
rather than nourish my choles­
terol levels.

Cuisine review ques­
tioned on food origins
Editor:
In the Liv­
ing section of 
The Tartan 
[“Exploring 
Pittsburgh’s
Vo
Letter to 
the Editor
Cultural Scene: Cuisine,” 2/3], I 
found a review of Yacov’s res­
taurant.
I will not pick on the review of 
the cuisine since I have never 
been to Yacov’s.
What I will pick on is this 
sentence: “A falafel is a Jewish 
sandwich, something like a veg­
etarian burrito.”
It is quite an accurate descrip­
tion that follows; however, it is 
not a “Jewish sandwich.”
My mother raised me on East­
ern European Jewish cuisine: 
brisket, kugel (pudding, either 
potato or noodle), babkah (yeast 
cake), challah (Sabbath bread 
which is similar to the Greek 
Easter bread), and the list goes 
on.
Never once did I taste falafel 
until a relative came from Israel 
and made some for us. It is a 
Middle Eastern dish. Please, do 
not equate the Middle East with 
Jews.
I am sure that many of the 
Arab students are as distraught 
as I am.
I am sure that the Lebanese 
and Syrians would be insulted if 
someone called kibbie (a 
meatloaf-like dish) a Jewish 
dish; however, it is the main 
course in the Syrian-Jewish 
meal for Passover — the cel­
ebration of the exodus from 
Egypt.
Jews live in every part of the 
world and their foods reflect the 
cultures around them: Eastern 
European Jews eat borscht (beet 
soup), Middle Eastern Jews eat 
hummus and falafel, Spanish 
Jews make kosher paella, Greek 
Jewsmake stuffedgrape leaves, 
and Indian Jews make curry.
I suggest that in the future 
Mr. Gallagher check not just the 
price and quality of cuisine, but 
its origin as well.
My husband makes a great 
curry, but he is not Indian — 
he’s Cypriot.

President’s defense restructuring ill-defined
Chris Restifo
A chemical engineering pro­
fessor óf mine who teaches ther­
modynamics often likes to tell 
jokes in class. One of my favor­
ites that perhaps every engineer­
ing major should take somewhat 
seriously is the story about how 
a fast food chain tried to make a 
pizza for the typical drive- 
through window.
Apparently, this fast food 
chaifi was tired of losing money 
to competition from a well- 
known pizza chain. So some 
people sat down to create a pizza 
that could be heated relatively 
quickly. The idea was that it 
would be cooked within the av­
erage amount of time it takes 
someone to drive from the little 
microphone at the menu to the 
pick,-up window.
The designers sat down and 
thought of everything they could 
do. They tried different ingredi­
ents, cooking methods, and other 
things. Well, after spending a 
good amount of money and time, 
they finally did it.
However, their joy was short 
live(J when one of them noticed 
(aftèr making this drive through 
pizza) that it wouldn’t fit through 
the window.
Granted, they were only hu­
man. Someone, however, forgot
to look at the big picture. Presi­
dent Bush’s plan for the future 
of,the military has the same 
myopic flaws as the idea of the 
drive-through pizza.
In order to keep the military 
well-fit and ready to go into ac­
tion while still cutting costs and 
reducing overall military spend­
ing, Bush and his administra­
tion have come up with a rather 
“unique” plan. It works basically 
like this: Instead of going to full- 
scale production of weapons that 
might never be used, the Penta­
gon will have contractors develop 
prototypes. In order to ensure 
quality, contractors will have to 
show that these prototypes ac­
tually work.
When any large amount of 
weaponry is then needed, pro­
duction can go full scale. Under 
this plan, supporters argue, 
money is saved, because the 
Pentagon will not spend billions 
of dollars on equipment never 
used. Additionally, the U.S. mili­
tary can still stay one step ahead 
of others in the technological 
race.
On paper, this method may 
look nice, but the implementa­
tion of such a scheme will cause 
waste, shoddy equipment, and a 
poor military in general.
First and foremost, the plan 
utterly and completely ignores 
the fact that people run the mili­
tary. You can have the world’s 
fastest computer hooked up to 
the world’s most sensitive de­
tection equipment and linked
with the greatest cruise missile 
ever made. However, when that 
one critical piece breaks down, 
it all amounts to junk. Only 
trained people with the know­
how and experience can fix it.
The idea of prototype develop­
ment makes training people ex-
fly effectively in combat.
Several other problems com­
pound each other to make the 
prototype method ineffective. 
What about the fixed costs of 
production? When war starts or 
hostilities are initiated and mass 
amounts of war materials are
The producers of all parts and 
materials have to fire up pro­
duction. A fully built tank that 
is missing one important ball­
bearing isn’t a very effective 
tank, is it?
Finally, the prototype method 
ignores the fact that the only
Some people in the military spend as much as two years 
learning their respective systems. When only a few pro­
totypes are made, how can you ensure that the hun­
dreds of people it may take to make the things work in 
combat are trained? They need to work on the real thing 
itself to obtain the experience.
tremely hard. Some people in 
the military spend as much as 
two years learning their respec­
tive systems.
When only a few prototypes 
are made, how can you ensure 
that the hundreds of people it 
may take to make the things 
work in combat are trained? 
They need to work on the real 
thing itself to obtain the experi­
ence.
Additionally, what about the 
people who use the weapon sys­
tem itself?
F-l 4 Tomcat pilots are some of 
the best in the world. Even 
though the concept of flying is 
the same for all aircraft, each 
one responds differently. You 
cannot expect a pilot to jump 
from one aircraft to another and
needed, you cannot expect facto­
ries and equipment to be built 
overnight.
Some people are already look­
ing at how civilian factories could 
be designed to be easily switched 
to military production (much like 
in the ex-Soviet Union), but the 
response time is too slow.
When a general needs tanks, 
he needs them now, not in four 
weeks when the factory comes 
on line.
As anyone involved in indus­
try knows, it usually takes more 
than one factory or company to 
make something. So, when the 
military needs massive amounts 
of materials and weapons in a 
short time, it’s not just the as­
sembly line that needs to get 
into gear.
way one can ensure a weapon 
works and that its users actu­
ally understand how to work it 
is to implement it on a mass 
scale. Every year, all branches 
of the military conduct opera­
tions of various levels to train 
people and assess their capabili­
ties.
Although they could perhaps 
electronically simulate the pro­
totypes, the admirals and gen­
erals would have no real data by 
which to judge the capabilities 
of their people and their equip­
ment.
Before someone is jumps on 
the high horse and think that I 
am supporting the current struc­
ture of procurement, let me say 
that I feel there’s a need for deep 
cuts in the military.
We could start by lompletely 
scrapping all land-baied nuclear 
missiles, the Strategc Defense 
Initiative, and costly ;hings like 
the B-2 bomber. Wecould also 
make some very deep :eductions 
in the number of pea>le in the 
Army and Air Force.
We should seriouslr look at 
what we need. With thi death of 
the Soviet Union, there is no 
longer an adversary yho can 
threaten the U.S. on i major 
scale. Among the insightful 
people who watch the,world, 
there is already the undestand­
ing that the military mist be
designed to respond rapidy and
quickly anywhere in the vorld. 
NATO has already envisioned a 
quick-response force of around 
70,000 to deal with regional con­
flicts.
Of course, the worst thing to 
do would be to start lacking 
away left and right at the de­
fense budget. As Dick Cheney 
and General Colin Powel have 
noted, doing such a thing would 
seriously undermine the mil­
itary’s capabilities.
The military must be reduced 
accordingly, but with a late and 
method that still allowsit to do 
its job effectively. The pritotype 
method is a far cry fran this 
much needed style of chinge.

lieves that the companies who 
built the B-2 should pay back 
everything to the government.
Campus leadership leaves much to be desired
Jeffrey Basista
An editorial in The Tartan last week 
[“Senate swells with members-at- 
large,” 2/3] expressed alarm over the 
number of unelected members in Stu­
dent Senate. The concern was that mem- 
bers-at-large are not elected, so they do 
not represent the student body. The 
editorial went on to suggest that the 
number of non-elected members should 
be sharply decreased, or possibly elimi­
nated, so that our Student Senate would 
be more representative.
Maybe all of us need to find out if 
Student Senate matters enough to 
worry about this lack of “representa­
tiveness.” Is Student Senate roughly 
the same as student government in 
high school — a farce — or is it more 
like “real” govement?
Does it have some important impact 
on our lives as students? I bet that most 
of us really don’t know, and we should 
at least find out. I worry that I might be
hanging on to misconceptions from 
younger years; maybe you are, too.
When I was in high school, I had no 
interest in student government because 
it had no useful purpose. Student gov­
ernment membership gave the pretty 
and popular people one more reason to 
think of themselves as wonderful hu­
man beings, regardless of what the 
truth might be.
No problem.
They didn’t have any effect on me, so 
did it really matter? If they got some 
fluff to put on their college applica­
tions, more power to them! Their posi­
tions did me no good, but they caused 
me no harm. I could live with that; I had 
better things to worry about.
When I came to college, I initially 
viewed Student Senate as a similar 
organization, one of those unfortunate 
extensions of high school, something 
that gave ambitious people a high place 
in an artificial hierarchy. Maybe that 
was being harsh.
Future politicians and business lead­
ers could certainly use administrative 
practice; as long as their actions had no 
effect on me, I didn’t worry too much
about them.
Although they might have some con­
trol over budgets for activities, they 
weren’t going to abolish films on the 
weekends. They weren’t going to inter­
fere with my off-campus activities. I 
could safely ignore them. I’m guessing 
that lots of other 
people feel the 
same way because 
elected Senate 
members aren’t at 
all representative 
of the student body.
Fewer than one in 
ten eligible voters 
elected our student 
government presi­
dent.
Only 8.4 percent 
of eligible voters 
bothered to cast 
votes in Novem­
ber’s Senate elec­
tion.
Is this a measure 
of student apathy?
I doubt it.
There are many
activities on campus. Any of you could 
quickly fill your schedule with activi­
ties. Why should you keep an eye on 
your student government? Are they 
likely to interfere with your activities, 
or to make student proclamations that 
don’t reflect your views at all?
I honestly don’t know. Majbe we 
should all find out.

Valentines confuse us all
VALENTINES, from page 7
system said he had to publicly 
prove he was in charge, so he 
ended up insulting her and pro­
voking arguments in front of his 
friends so he could prove who 
tfore the pants in the relation­
ship. Two months later, he had 
the gall to wonder what went 
wrong.
The one sensible reason for 
the death (or deep vegetative 
state) of the GRG revolves 
around risk theory (I have to use 
four years of IM classes for some­
thing). Assuming that normal 
people don’t put deep emotional 
commitment ahead of, say, 
knowing the person’s name, 
there’s a gamble involved. You 
have some sort of existing rela­
tionship with a person—it may 
be trivial, it may be larger. Do 
you roll the dice with that in 
hopes of getting into the vaguely- 
defined territory of “love”?
So you wait for “the odds” to 
stack further in your favor and 
go through the possible permu­
tations. “Let’s see. Friendship 
touched with a little id-driven 
lust, stacked against general
indifference and a preference for 
guys who can bench-press a 
Volkswagen. Can we deal the 
cards again?”
Lastly, there’s the tragic fact 
that society coaches us to mis­
trust the opposite sex. It’s been 
embedded in our minds that it’s 
easiest to lump people into clas­
sifications and treat them on a 
lowest common denominator 
basis. Assume the worst, and 
anything else is a pleasant sur­
prise.
The standard line is that we 
men are stupid and have sex on 
the brain all the time — no ex­
ceptions. Yet women so often 
misunderstand us, with may­
hem and the perpetuation of the 
myth as the results. Does this 
scene sound familiar? A man 
and a woman are at a party 
(assume platonic friendship be­
tween the two), when the follow­
ing exchange takes place:
Man: See that girl over there? 
She’s really attractive. I wonder 
if I should introduce myself.
Woman: I don’t see an y girls. I 
see a woman. Why is it that you 
men can’t treat women equally?
And then the woman wonders 
why the man scuttles off to a 
comer with other men to make 
baseless promiscuity judge­
ments with impunity. It’s back­
lash at its finest.
Women? Well, they’re evil and 
they lie. They use men and throw 
us away when something better 
comes along.
If they admit that they find a 
man attractive, they, must sleep 
around (nothing like a throw­
back to Victorian beliefs). Ey- 
erybody knows that, right? (For 
the sarcasm-impaired, the above 
is not, by any stretch ofthe imagi­
nation, what I believe, so stop 
writing that Letter to the Edi­
tor.)
With all of the above floating 
around out there, it’s a wonder 
that romance is still alive at all. 
In that sense, maybe Valentine’s 
Day is worth making a fuss over.
Jason McDonald is a senior 
IM major who will conveniently 
be hiding out in Boston this 
Valentine’s Day just m case the 
sarcasm-impaired lynch mob 
shows up looking for him.

America needs one
AMERICA, from page 7
mainly through attempts to in­
fluence education.
This is an extremely discon­
certing prospect. Attempting to 
reverse the progress of Ameri­
can culture can only create more 
social problems and exacerbate 
problems that already exist.
In many education systems 
throughout the country, the idea 
of teaching minority history and 
culture has become a major 
theme in debates on education. 
In New York, a curriculum re­
port on multiculturalism was 
written this past year to recom­
mend a new approach to educa­
tion in New’York.
The report was aimed at em­
phasizing education from differ­
ent racial and ethnic points of 
view. This may seem innocent 
enough, but in fact the commit­
tee that wrote the report in­
cluded Professor Ali Mazrui, who 
believes that the fall of Western 
society is good for the world. 
This report wasn’t just to in­
crease minority influence in edu­
cation, but to see the destruc­
tion of Western history and cul­
ture.
It is also possible to have a 
specific view of history (incor­
rect or not) to be adopted as part 
of a curriculum. In New York, a 
Native American lobby group 
had the curriculum changed to 
include the idea that- the fram­
ers of the Constitution borrowed 
ideas from the Iroquois.
There is no strong evidence 
for this story, yet one group 
managed to have its culture pro­
moted and to put down another 
culture.
An accurate history of the 
United States is something we 
should all have in common. 
Many object to this because 
much of American history con­
centrates on the contributions 
of white Europeans. However, 
the simple truth is that white 
Europeans are responsible for 
the creation of much of this na­
tion and the ideals that ensure 
many of our freedoms. The way 
history is taught in this nation 
may not fully credit minorities 
for their contributions, but that 
does not justify rejecting it out of 
hand.
On this and many other col­
lege campuses, we are constantly 
being pressed to experience and 
learn about various cultures, the 
International Festival and the 
programs for Black History 
Month being two good examples. 
Some schools have days dedi­
cated to programs of diversity.
I don’t intend to disparage any 
groups that wish to do this for 
purely educational purposes, but 
in many cases such programs 
are developed with the elusive 
idea of creating better “diver­
sity” on campus and hopefully 
making us more tolerant indi­
viduals.
Those who are intolerant of 
others are not likely to be af­
fected by these programs. Mean­
while, others will see them as 
yet another condemnation of 
American society, since they are 
often inspired by cries of how 
the establishment represses all 
minority culture.
Should each of us ignore the 
cultures around us? Certainly 
not, there are many interesting
things to be learned from differ­
ent histories and cultures.

CMU loses first home game
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
’s a lot of fun 
be the
nd bully
How my friends and I ended 
playing hockey with high 
kids and younger is 
me. We had a pretty 
idea going, using the 
court near my house as 
makeshift rink. Eventu- 
, we bought a net to make 
effect complete (shooting 
of tape just isn’t the 
thing), and a new dimen- 
was added when the 
net came down in
, opening up the rest 
court.
j Then the Edgewood Borough 
! powers-that-be got involved.
¡All of a sudden, 3 to 5 pm was 
¡declared hockey time at 
! Koenig Field. Nets came out of 
'nowhere, along with rug rats 
¡to use them. Since no other 
; place was available to play, we 
J decided to join the fray, even 
¡though we were by far the 
! largest people on the court.
Despite the size advantage, 
these kids weren’t too bad. The 
scariest sight was the line of 
who were 
running set plays with the 
precision of the Soviet teams of 
the early ‘80s. Of course, you 
didn’t hit these kids because 
that’s just wouldn’t have been 
fair.
The older kids were fair 
game, though. In our drills, my 
friends and I all hit each other 
I — that seemed only fair — but 
\ we were just playing for fun 
\ here. Then the 15-year olds 
! opened the door by trying,
! unsuccessfully, to smash my 
! friend Jim when he was 
1 digging for the ball along the 
; chain-link fence surrounding 
| the court. In the spirit of 
| giving what you’re getting, we 
! started shoving back. Not to 
! the point of violence, but 
! enough to make a point.
I You’d be surprised at how 
; mouthy these kids got. I 
; remember starting back 
; upcourt and hearing one of 
these punks talking about how 
! he was going to “get” my foot- 
! taller, several-pounds-heavier 
i brother next time down.
; And it was to get worse, too. 
t When they scored a goal, we 
| were told to our faces that we 
| sucked. When we scored, it 
was simply because we were 
I bigger. We could have cowered 
I behind the legitimate excuse 
i that we had been playing for 
[ almost three hours before they 
; even got there, but there’s the 
\ issue of maturity.
[ The last goal was a great 
I personal satisfaction because 
it was a triumph for brute 
! strength. We put a shot on net,
. and having seen that fair play
• had been out the window for 
[ some time, I decided to play
| “Whack the Goalie’s Glove and 
\ See What Pops Loose.” The 
I ball popped loose, my second 
I shot went off the post, and the 
I third finally went in. Game 
! over — might makes right, 
i The following week, we
• made one more attempt to
| play with them, even mixing 
[ °ur group with theirs. It didn’t 
| do much good though — they 
; had decided we were bullies,
! so the badmouthing continued.
! Now we play alone again —
1 it s sad that sportsmanship 
| breaks down in the real world, 
j hut that’s the way things go 
; sometimes.

The University Athletic Asso­
ciation title race began in ear­
nest on Friday night when 
Washington University (ranked 
1 Oth in Division III) came to the 
Skibo Gym to take on the ninth- 
place Tartans. Unfortunately for 
the Tartans, the Bears held off a 
late CMU rally to pull out a 55- 
54 win and move ahead in the 
Association race—Washington 
is now 7-1 in the UAA, while the 
Tartans have a mark of 8-2.
As was the case in both games 
last year, CMU fell back in the 
second half and made a late run. 
Unlike last year’s contests, the 
Tartans went scoreless down the 
stretch — a basket by freshman 
forward Meredith McKnight 
with 2:40 left made the score 
54-52, but the Tartans wouldn’t 
score again until senior guard 
Bridget Eperthener scored off a 
rebound as time ran out.
The first half of the game was, 
appropriately enough, a 27—27 
tie. Washington got on top, 16- 
8, near the middle of the period 
with a 10-0 run, but the Tartans 
stormed back. McKnight added 
two points, and sophomore for­
ward Mary Moore hit two
straight baskets to bring the 
Bears lead down to two points 
with eight minutes left in the 
half. The teams jockeyed for po­
sition down the stretch, and 
Washington’s Jennifer Gibbs hit 
two free throws at the 26-second 
mark to re-tie the game at 27.
The Bears came out gunning 
in the second half. After senior 
guard Katie Fahey beat the 30- 
second clock for the first score of 
the half, the Bears exploded for 
an 11-point run. When head 
coach Gerri Seidl finally called 
for a timeout at the 16:00 mark, 
the score was 38-29, Washing­
ton.
As has been the tradition of 
the CMU-Washington games, 
things got worse for the Tartans 
before they got better,. Not only 
did the lead balloon back to 11 
after a brief Tartan rally, but 
senior forward Amy Buxbaum 
had to leave the game with four 
fouls.
Or so one would have thought. 
In a surprising move 'by Seidl, 
Buxbaum returned to the lineup 
with more than 12 minutes re­
maining. The move paid off, as 
Buxbaum scored six of her 12 
points during the comeback run.
However, the biggest play of

Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball 
team was defeated in the closing sec­
onds of Friday’s game against Wash­
ington University, 70-69. This disturb­
ing scenario is starting to become too 
familar for the Tartans and their fans.
In the last three games, CMU has 
been able to build substantial leads 
against NYU, Brandeis, and Wash. U., 
all strong UAA opponents. All three 
games have resulted in last minute 
losses, lowering the team’s record to 2— 
7 in the UAA (seventh place) and 7-9 
overall. According to Wingen, the prob­
lem seems to be maintaining the play­
ers’ focus and concentration while hold­
ing these leads. The team could easily 
be 5-4 in league play, and fighting for 
third place had it been able to sustain 
its concentration and focus.
The first nine minutes of the game 
against Washington were a see-saw 
battle with both teams trading bas­
kets. The Bears built a six-point lead at 
24-18, and head coach Tony Wingen 
called time-out to instruct the team to 
maintain its focus. The Tartans re­
sponded with an 11-0 run thanks to a 
three-pointer from junior Chris Benec, 
a basket by sophomore Charlie Connors, 
and two three-pointers by junior Todd 
Jenkins. The Bears answered with six 
straight points to regain the lead.
Connors left with a sprained ankle 
before the half ended, and his 6’7"
210 lbs. was noticeably absent. The 
Tartans were out-rebounded 22-15, 
and allowed the Bears second and third 
shot opportunities. Jenkins and sopho­
more Derek Dragisich led the Tartans 
with nine points each, ending the half 
tied at 34.
In the second half, CMU hit four 
three-pointers during a 21-10 run es­
tablishing their biggest lead of the game 
at 55-44. Wingen was very happy with 
the efforts of sophomore Brad Law­
rence, who came off the bench to fill in 
for the injured Connors. However, the 
Bears began to slowly chip away at the 
lead, and the Tartans’ concentration 
began to waver.
A Wash. U. player was assessed a 
technical foul after arguing a foul called 
against him, resulting in three free- 
throw attempts for CMU. The Tartans 
failed to capitalize, missing all three.
The Bears then went on a 9-2 run 
and led the game 64—61. Sophomore 
Mike Hosni scored a basket and two 
free-throws to put CMU back up 65-64 
with 1:43 remaining. The Bears hit 
four free-throws and Hosni answered 
with another basket. After another 
technical foul on Wash. U., Jenkins 
smoothly knocked down the two foul 
shots, and CMU led 69-68.
With possession of the ball, the Tar­
tans only needed to burn the last 39 
seconds off the clock for the win. Unfor­
tunately, CMU was not able to hang on 
to the ball, turning it over to the Bears,

Swim teams prepare for UAA championships
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU swim teams trav­
eled to Slippery Rock Univer­
sity last Saturday, February 1, 
where the men’s team found 
another victory and the women’s 
team fell victim to a team of 
superior depth. The men’s team 
defeated Slippery Rock 117-87. 
The women’s team was domi­
nated by SRU, 135-59.
The women were able to win 
only two events of the meet. Se­
nior Glynis Frost captured the 
first place ribbon in the 1000- 
yard freestyle race finishingwith 
a time of11:30.56. Frost was the 
only CMU swimmer in this event
out of four competitors. Sopho­
more Denise Fenwick won the 
other first place finish for CMU. 
Fenwick took first place in the 
200-yard breast stroke with her 
time of 2:35.45.
The men’s team did not share 
the lack of depth with the 
women’s team, as they won seven 
of the 11 events swam. The relay 
team of sophomore Johnathan 
Kline, junior Jamie Millar, 
sophomore AnupamNarula, and 
freshman Donald Nelson started 
the meet on a high note for the 
men’s team as they won the open­
ing 400-yard medley relay with 
a time of 4:02.56.
Millar had two individual vic­
tories to go with the relay. He
“The team has a great chance of 
qualifying in several events. ”
— Marcy Sensenich
swam a 2:06.41 to win the 200- 
yard individual medley and he 
also took first in the 200-yard 
breast stroke as he finished in 
2:21.11. Senior Brian Zimmer­
man also captured two first 
places. His time of10:55.92 won 
the 1000-yard freestyle and his 
time of 1:48.01 won the 200- 
yard freestyle.
Freshman Gary Groznik 
swam a lifetime best as he won 
the 500-yard freestyle in 5:19.56.
Freshman Jason Burkey won the 
100-yard freestyle in 48.92.
This was the last regular meet 
of the season for the CMU swim­
mers. They next face the UAA 
Championships at Emory Uni­
versity this Wednesday to Fri­
day. The team has high hopes 
for the conference meet.
Freshman Marcy Sensenich, 
who swam a lifetime best at Slip­
pery Rock in the 200-yard breast 
stroke, said, “We’re all looking
forward to it. The team has a 
great chance of qualifying in sev­
eral events.” Sensenich has set a 
personal goal to “better my time 
to 2:45 in the 200-yard breast 
stroke.”
Kline, who also had a lifetime 
best at Slippery Rock, agrees 
with Sensenich about the team 
being excited and ready. “The 
training in Florida helped tre­
mendously to prepare us for this 
tapering. We’re ready to go out 
and swim some good races.” 
Cutrone has set minimal goals 
that he expects his teams to 
achieve. He sees the men’s team 
finishing second, and the 
women’s team making over 300 
points and finishing around fifth.

win. Junior Charlie Borsheim 
was able to hit a short jumper 
with three seconds left to give 
the Bears the win. He lead the 
team with 25 points and 10 re­
bounds.
The Tartans were led by jun­
ior guard Todd Jenkins, who 
scored 19 points (including five 
for five from three-point range) 
and nine assists.
He ranks in the top twelve in 
assists in Division III, averag­
ing 6.3 a game. Dragisich added
13 points and 10 rebounds, Hosni 
scored 11 points, and sophomore 
Rony Johns scored 10 points.
After a game like this, one has 
to wonder about the effect on the 
Tartan players. Fan support 
seemed to keep team spirits up; 
Wingen said, “The fan support 
at this game was the best I’ve 
seen in the two years I’ve been

tor to play in front of a gym full 
of loud fans.”

his assessment of the game say­

16The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 10 February 1992
WOMEN’S BB, from page 13
the comeback came from the Bears. On a steal by 
Eperthener, Washington’s Gibbs stopped the tran­
sition basket with a foul that would have im­
pressed an NFL linebacker coach. Referee Don 
Console whistled Gibbs with the intentional foul 
(two shots and possession), creating a four-point 
swing. With 7:47 left to play, the Tartans were 
back within four, 48-44.
The Bears’ lead held between four and six for 
most of the duration. When Buxbaum and 
McKnight hit back-to-back baskets to make the 
score 54-52, it looked as if Comeback Part Three 
was on its way. However, with 2:18 left, Washing­
ton forward Chanda Jackson hit one of two free 
throws to force the Tartans into a three-point 
offense. Washington’s Sarah Goldman and Carolyn
Royce both missed one-and-one chances to keep 
the lead at three, but on the final attack, the 
Washington defense forced Fahey inside the three- 
point line, making the miss of her final shot and 
the Eperthener second-effort score academic.
Eperthener led all scorers with 13 points; 
Buxbaum added 12 points and 12 rebounds; and 
sophomore forward Jeanine Megahan added eight 
points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. The 
Bears were led by Stacy Leeds (12 points) and 
Sarah Goldman (10 points). Jackson added nine 
points and nine rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon, now 16-3 overall, will host 
Grove City tonight at 6 pm in the last non-UAA 
game of the season. This Friday, the Tartans will 
play at Brandéis University against a Judge squad 
that fell to the Tartans, 59-45, in Pittsburgh.

CMU falls in battle of 
nationally-ranked teams
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan StaffWriter
The Carnegie Mellon hockey 
club started the weekend with a 
trip to Morgantown, West Vir­
ginia to take on once-defeated 
West Virginia University. The 
game began poorly for the Tar­
tans, but they battled back 
against adversity and a hostile 
environment to tie the Moun­
taineer^', 3—3
The first period was a slow 
one with West Virginia scoring 
the only goal seven minutes into 
the game. West Virginia scored 
early in the second period and 
extended their lead to 3-0 with a 
goal with less than two minutes 
left in the period.
The Mountaineers took a de­
fensive stance for the third pe­
riod, presuming their three goal 
lead too much for the CMU 
hockey team to surmount. And 
when junior defenseman Jan- 
Marc Featherston went out of 
the game with a dislocated shoul­
der with six minutes remaining 
in the game, West Virginia felt 
the game was over.
But, with 2:01 to play in the 
game, P.J. Mann scored an 
unassisted goal to put CMU on 
the board. At 1:22 remaining, a 
trio of graduate students com­
bined to score CMU’s second 
goal. Scott Sarbacker passed the 
puck to Erik Galis, who sent it to 
Dave Collins, who buried it in 
the net. Collins scored another 
point as he joined with senior 
captain Ed Kilduff to assist Galis
for the game-tying goal with only 
36 seconds to play in the game.
The CMU team played a good 
game on both sides of the puck, 
despite coming away with a tie. 
They wore down the West Vir­
ginia defense, getting away 53 
shots on goal during the game, 
while the CMU defense only al­
lowed 20 shots on goal, and only 
three of those came in the third 
period. Carnegie Mellon stayed 
out of the penalty box as well, 
accruing only six minutes in pen­
alties.
Yesterday afternoon, Carnegie 
Mellon took on Indiana Univer­
sity of Pennsylvania in Kittan- 
ing. The game was a rather slow 
one, which the Tartans con­
trolled and came back in the 
third period to win, 6-4.
The first period was evenly 
matched, with neither team able 
to make or take advantage of 
opportunities. Kilduff scored the 
first goal of the game with an 
assist from Galis four and a half 
minutes into the first period. 
IUP scored the tying goal with 
1:06 in the period.
IUP wouldn’t go away as the 
second period progressed. 
Kilduff scored his second goal of 
the day early in the second, giv­
ing CMU a 2—1 lead. IUP coun­
tered with a goal of their own 
less than a minute later. CMU 
went on a power play after an 
interference penalty against 
IUP. Kilduff and Sarbacker as­
sisted Galis on the resulting goal 
as Galis took the puck from the 
opponent’s end line, skated to
the goal, faked out the goal] 
and planted the puck in the n( 
Carnegie Mellon led the gaj 
until IUP tied it, 3-3, at 1:2 j
IUP opened the third pei{ 
strongly, taking their first 1^ 
of the game with 15:44 to pig 
Five minutes later, Galis, ; 
assisted by Sarbacker 
Kilduff, scored a goal to tie tl 
game at four each. Less ttu 
thirty seconds later, after an It 
penalty, Sarbacker fired in a sh 
from the blue line to take {] 
lead. Collins and Galis made tl 
assists. From here, Carne| 
Mellon dominated, with Kildu 
scoring a hat trick, with an^
sist from Galis, with 8:18 to pla
The game ended uneventfull 
although the final eight mil 
utes were filled with verbal vo 
leys and a few shoves and push 
between the rival teams.
After the game, graduate st\ 
dent goalkeeper Scott Berry con 
mented, “We came in overcon 
dent and had to get it togetK 
for the third period.”
Kilduff noted, “We hadtopa 
ourselves for the first two per 
ods because we were short son 
players, but we came back 
played the third. That’s ho 
we’ve been winning games.”;
This weekend, the Carneg 
Mellon hockey club plays 
Neville Ice Rink on the Sout 
Side against rival neighbor Pi 
on Friday and league-leadii 
WVU on Sunday. Sandwich« 
in between the two home garni

The steam tunnels are an historic and 
fascinating part of our campus, and because 
of that, we believe they are worth talking 
about. For some, like our intrepid 
reporters, the draw to them is irresistable.
However, we are not advocating visits to 
the steam tunnels. Entering the steam 
tunnels is trespassing, and anyone who 
does so risks expulsion. Furthermore, the 
tunnels are dangerous — the rules and 
penalties exist for good reason.
Enjoy this issue of the Karnege, but 
please be aware that while they are exciting 
and interesting, the steam tunnels are no 
longer the place for students.

Sometimes you have to get off the train
I’ve been teaching at CMU since it became CMU — in 1967, when CIT united with Mellon Institute. That means I’ve been watching CMU students for a few years longer than most of my current English majors have been alive.And every semester as a part-time teacher I get views of their interior lives, for I teach Magazine Writing and encourage little psychodramas with as­signments such as: “If someone were to describe your life based solely on the magazines you have read, from childhood to the present, what would they discover about you?” Many young people are ashamed of their magazine reading habits, and like alcoholics who have just taken the pledge, re­solve to do better in the future.I also ask them to write about people and things that arc personally impor­tant, especially subjects that are not campus spe­cific, but rather off-cam­pus and experiential, hav­ing to do with family, rela­tives, homc-towns, social issues.This long watch as reader, advisor and teacher leads me to offer CMU undergraduates one general piece of advice: your life and work on this campus is so intense, so isolated from the world outside of this university, that you must make an extra effort to stay connected with the real world.Undcrgraduatcs at CMU arc like passengers sealed in a four-car train racing towards Success. Eveiy year if they behave like workaholics they can move up to the next car, and after the fourth car they can get off and see what happened recently in the World. But during their years of study they arc grade-driven, shielded from distractions by their focus on academic survival, and hardly capable of stepping oft' the train.But stepping off the train is a responsibility, a spiritual need, and can make you a better person. You owe it to your intellectual life to stay in touch, even if rarely, with what is happening out there in the non- collcgiate world. And I’m not talking about going
more often to the movies or finding a summer job at the shore.I mean getting involved somehow with a social or civic issue, with old people and children, with profes­sionals in their work, with a political campaign or a volunteer group. Maybe you can do it through a church or synagogue, a United Way effort, or a sports club. It seems hard to break out of the CMU mind-set, but it’s really just a matter of taking one step, and keeping an open mind about experience.I recently was gart of the group that tried to save the Syria Mosque — a volunteer group. We lost the Mosque, but in the course of the struggle I met wonderful people young and old, got involved in preservation politics, learned how local government really works, and started to feel responsible about giving something back to society. After the mosque was torn down a new activist group formed — Preser­vation Pittsburgh — which is now doing something about saving other historic buildings and helping rewrite the preservation laws in the city.It’s easy to lose sight of a very big obligation when you are at school: you are getting an expensive, high-performance educa­tion that will equip you to give something back to society, to help shape or­ganizations and policies. You ought to get in the habit, however you can do it, of thinking of your­self as part of that society, of contributing to it.After all, your life is now unfolding in a city where most of the country’s problems and inequities are easily found. Poor people arc searching the trash for food, racism is making a comeback, a Pittsburgh Pirate baseball player signs a contract for $4.7 million a year while librarians can’t find work, abortion/pro-choice and gay rights advocates are seeking support, the city is cutting back on services and places like Schenley Park go unmaintained.You can’t solve it all or much of it, but at least you can be there sometimes, and begin to see how your values play out in the world of non-college students, of governments and laws. Your famous alumnus and New York philosopher Andy Warhol summed it up by saying one of the basic keys to his success “was j List showing up.”

Where pipes, steam lines,and the unknown lurk
“Every secret crime has its 
reporter. ”
— Unknown
There is no one word to describe what you feel after you 
enter the steam tunnels. Fear, excitement, amazement, anxi­ety, elation, terror— I felt them all at once, mixing together, 
attempting to overwhelm me.The tunnels were nothing like anything I’d ever seen. Hundreds of pipes and tubes, all different shapes, sizes, and colors, covered the walls and ceiling. Valves, knobs, switches, grates, wires, and debris were everywhere. The whistling sound of steam continuously rose and fell in volume — never letting me relax, even for a moment, and the lights! Lights 
were everywhere, lining the tunnel’s walls, illuminating every­thing in sight with their eerie fluorescent glow.I didn’t enter a tunnel — I entered a living beast.Slowly, the initial shock of the extensive sights and sounds sunk in and we began our voyage. There were three of us in 
total, “Flash,” who was a steam tunnel veteran, this being his fifth trip, “Sketch,” who had never been in the tunnels until 
that night, and me.I had been in some of the smaller tunnels a couple of times, but never in the “main” tunnel — the tunnel which begins its run at Doherty Hall, extends to CFA, and then catacombs throughout most of campus.Flash informed me that we had just entered a small branch of the main tunnel and that I hadn’t seen anything yet. I shook 
my head in agreement, but in my mind doubted that anything could be more amazing than our initial sight.I soon found out that I was wrong.Spanning at least the length of Baker Hall, the main tunnel was truly breathtaking. Perfectly straight, columned with lights, and going on seemingly forever into the distance, I 
began to understand what infinity looks like.Sketch entered the tunnel next, viewed the remarkable sight before him, and shared in my speechlessness. Even Flash
was dumbstruck momentarily.A blast of steam nearby made us quickly regain our senses. 
I was already sweating, partly due to the heat and partly due to the fear of getting caught, but this new tunnel was even hotter than the entrance area — it must have been at least 90 degrees. We removed our coats and other layers until only our 
T-shirts were exposed.After we were done, Flash took control of our small group once again and began to leading us down the tunnel, away 
from Wean Hall, towards CFA. The large amount of graffiti on the walls and garbage scattered on the floor made it apparent that we were not the only student group to journey down here. Some of the graffiti was very old, dating back several years, while other portions were penned recently. So recent, in fact, that one message, written in yellow paint, was 
still partially wet. We pressed on.Flash assumed the role of tour guide, and pointed out to us the various exits leading out to the Cut and Mall, all of which were a good ten feet or so above our heads; the vari­ous pipes, what they carried and where they led; and told us about some of his prior expeditions down here and how a couple of years ago, for some unknown reason, the tunnel was filled with knee- deep water. Sketch and I lis­
tened attentively, fascinated by his knowledge and experi­ence.
Soon we approached a sec­tion of the tunnel which will always stand out in my memory — a ladder which 
led straight up into the dark­ness.“Want to have some realSketch admires the intricate pipes and valves near the entrance.

it lîl '
fun?” Flash asked Sketch and I with a devilish smirk on his face.
“Sure,” we said. That’s the whole reason why we came down here, right?“This ladder leads into a 
big alcove above, which I think is under the stairs near CFA,” Flash informed us.“Anyhow, it’s really cool, but ... there’s no lights up there.”Flash just sort of stared at us while we began to realize what he was saying — there were no lights. If we went up there 
we would have to face com­plete darkness ... in the steam tunnels.“So,” Flash said anxiously,
“do you want to go up?”The only light source we had on us were two very small flashlights, and one of them 
had weak batteries. I weighed 
the options, and, in the end, my curiosity beat out my sense of reason.“Okay,” I told Flash, “I’ll
go-”Flash smiled.Sketch decided to stay be­hind and wait for us to return, which was a good idea in ret­rospect, because what followed had to be the five most intense and fearful minutes of my entire life.
The emotions I felt as I entered that abyss of icy darkness easily dwarfed everything I experienced when we first ven­tured into the tunnels. I could hear every single beat of my heart, I could feel my blood racing throughout my body, my eyes darted everywhere, desperately trying to focus, desper­ately trying to find purchase on anything tangible, but I couldn’t even see my hand in front of my face — for the first time in my life I felt raw, uncontrolled fear. I felt that I was only moments away from having a complete mental breakdown.Gradually, my eyes adjusted to the dark­ness, but after I realized what I was seeing,I was beginning to wish that my eyes hadn’t.Flash and I were in an alcove maybe 40 feet 
long and 15 feet wide. The walls were concrete, covered with graffiti, and the ceiling appeared to be the bottom part of a staircase. However, it was the floor that horrified me.It wasn’t made out of concrete, but was 
a rough mound of dirt, which towered towards the ceiling. Immediately, images of 
small and large creatures living in this mound filled my mind, and I couldn’t shake the image — me and those animals ... together

... in the dark.“What if there’s some­thing living in here?” I asked Flash.
Flash was silent, grasping the full meaning behind my seven simple words. “Oh God, we’re dead,” was all that Flash could muster.
Hearing these words, I snapped and I bolted straight for the exit. But Flash got hold of me in time, joked around a little, and put me at ease. Somehow we managed to explore the rest of the al­cove without me having a complete breakdown.In due time, Flash and I 
exited the alcove, picked up Sketch, and resumed our jour­ney. The rest of the trip was filled with many interesting 
mini-adventures: We explored a long, narrow tunnel which stretched below the CFA building and right into GSIA; we found a phone in the tun­nels which we used to call our friends; we explored another side tunnel which led our group into the basement ofthe Gym; and eventuallyended our evening exitingthrough Maggie Moe. But of all the areas and places Flash,Sketch, and I explored on that cold winter night, that alcovebelow the CFA stairs will always stick in my mind as the most exciting, and most terrifying, event of the evening.
I wonder if I would do it again?

The steam tunnels burrow their way through CMU history
UU^-
“If you don't like the heat, get 
out of the kitchen. ”
— Harry S. Truman
The steam tunnels that branch across the campus aren’t mysterious catacombs to everyone. Although it’s tempting to think of the tunnels as secret passageways that have been shrouded in mystery for as long as Carnegie Mellon has been around, the history and purpose of the tunnels isn’t as cloak and dagger as the legend might suggest.
History of the Steam Tunnels
Physical Plant Plumber/Stcamfittcr Foreman Ralph Hil­bert knows graduates of Margaret Morrison Institute who remember the steam tunnels well. “Years ago [before Carn­egie Tech merged with Margaret Morrison Institute],” said Hilbert, “students used to use it as a shortcut... it used to be 
a common practice.”But that was decades ago, when a person could easily move around in the tunnels, and they were well-lit. Hilbert, who has been in the steam tunnels several times since he has been at 
Carnegie Mellon, described them as “very poorly lit, damp spaces.” Hilbert said that people “used to be able to walk through [them] ... now it’s impossible.”
What Steam Tunnels AreSteve Lyons, assistant director of maintenance program 
and planning for Physical Plant, described the steam tunnels and the purpose they serve. “[The tunnels] are set up for 
combinations of distribu­tion,” said Lyons. The tun­
nels are arranged for main steam, main water, and main electrical distribution, and some of them also have tele­phone and computer line dis­tribution as well. That means that the tunnels contain pipes and lines which carry steam, water and electricity at very high pressure, temperature, and voltage.“The steam tunnel sys­tem is typical for any campus this size,” said Lyons. Accord­ing to Lyons, college cam­puses used to be built with 
steam tunnel systems like the one we have because they were
the most efficient way to heat several buildings at once. As 
Hilbert put it, “It used to be the way to go.”“The boilers used to be in Hamcrschlag,” said Lyons, “and the turret is where the smokestack for the boilers was.... 
Most of the tunnels lead back into Hamcrschlag, one way or 
another.”According to Lyons, the tunnels are now used mainly as service tunnels. “The steam for the entire campus runs through them,” he added. So the tunnels are still in use, and, as a result ofthe steam, are veiy hot. Hilbert said that around Wean Hall, “you [sometimes] see fans blowing out very hot air that looks like it’s coming from nowhere ... those tans arc ventilating the 
steam tunnels.”Even with insulated piping, the temperatures in the tun­nels can rise over 100 degrees fahrenheit; after all, the water inside the pipes is hotter than 200 degrees. Hilbert said that 
in the winter, when there’s snow on the Cut, “from Hunt [Library] to Forbes, there’s a line melted where the steam 
tunnels arc.”
Potential Dangers 
Lyons and Hilbert both commented on the hazard in- . volved in people being in the steam tunnels, and not under­
standing what they arc. “They’re really dangerous places,” said Lyons. “High-pressure steam, water at over 200 degrees, high voltage electricity ...besides, they’re hot.” The pipes in 
the tunnels have been replaced over the years, but there are still some old pipes which could injure someone.In addition to the temperature and the clusters of pipes in the tunnels, there’s very little space to move in them. Even if you could manage to fit through some of the tunnels, the 
ceilings sometimes dip as low as 5' 11" without counting the overhead pipes. Add extreme heat to that, and the result is something just short of one of the circles of Dante’s In­
ferno.
So there’s the mystique in 
the tunnels. In the imagina­tion, they seem to suggest adventure, a secret, empty network under campus just waiting to be explored. In reality, the steam tunnels are 
closer to Indiana Jones’ 
Temple of Doom than The Last 
Crusade.

Bellefield Boiler Plant steams up CMU
“It is easier to admire 
hard work if you don't do
It.
— Unknown
I’ve wandered down Forbes Avenue toward The Carnegie and Craig Street countless times having only one thing in mind — two scoops of 
cinnamon bun ice cream and an apple muffin from Buznuddcr’s. Due to my sweet tooth and my general dislike for rusty railroad tracks and crum­bling buildings, I rarely looked down at what was below the bridge that leads to my destination. There was no sign of life down there — only decay and the 
roar of passing trains.But as I recently learned, hidden 
under two smokestacks, is an important source which provides the surrounding Oakland area with heat. It is the Bellefield Boiler Plant that warms up the CMU academic buildings and dor­
mitories. Without the plant, our steam tunnels wouldn’t even be famous.Andrew Carnegie dedicated the 
non-profit Bellefield Boiler Plant in 1895. The plant not only heats CMU, but the University of Pittsburgh, the 
Schenley area, The Carnegie, Presbyte­rian-University Hospital, Eye and Ear 
Hospital, and Children’s Hospital as well. With all the prestigious places the 
plant keeps running, one would think it would be well known.
The plant’s collective keeps a low profile though— so low that many people aren’t aware that they even exist. The location of the plant is equally elusive. It is right next door to The Carnegie, blit a couple of flights down. I couldn’t find a road that led to the plant, so I had to play the “process of 
elimination” game by riding up and down the elevator ofThe Carnegie parking garage, hoping to find the ground level at which the plant was lo­cated.
After a short trudge through the mud and snow I found the plant’s entrance. Or so I thought. The doors were locked. So I tried another door — one 
plastered with warning and caution signs. There seemed to be considerable risk and I almost opted to run up the hill towards CMU. I don’t know what held me back. I guess it was my duty to break the plant’s cover and learn about the place that steams up the surrounding Pittsburgh area....
The inside of the Bellefield Boiler Plant was threatening. The boilers hissed, the oxygen level
didn’t seem quite up to par, and no one was in sight. I almost expected Freddy Kreuger to come out from behind the boilers. All I could think ofwas how long this assignment would take and how dirty my clothes would get. But after admiring the vintage Coke machine hidden in a corner, wonder­ing how much it was worth and if there was any way of removing it from the building, I found signs of 
civilization sitting at an old wooden table. Five plant workers clad in blue uniforms sat at the dimly lit table — either smoking cigarettes or just reclin­ing in their chairs. I wasn’t sure they were eager to see an intruder.
I half expected to be escorted to the door — either that or squeezed into one of the water pipes
feeding the boilers. I was wrong. One of the workers, Steve Renyus, an assistant engineer wear­
ing a hard hat with the word “Fatso” written all over it, stepped forward and offered to give me the grand tour of the plant. After he showed me around 
the plant and told me how his work ruined his hearing, Ait Shipley, an engineer with a cigarette dangling from his lips, took over to show me the main control room. What I found out forever changed my view of all the heating vents I’ve seen:There were six boilers at the Bellefield Boiler Plant. One burned gas or oil; one burned gas, coal 
and oil; two burned gas and coal; and two burned only coal. Over twenty workers work night and day shifts to keep the plant functioning. Usually four cars filled with seventy tons of coal each arrive at the plant each day, but on the day I was there, there was no delivery.I didn’t learn about the complete process of 
how the heat is produced, but I was introduced to several different types of equipment necessary for the process.Coal drop-off point: A car filled with coal is
brought into an area that looks very much like the service area for an amusement park choo-choo train. The coal is then weighed and dropped into a pit below. Conveyor belts cariy the coal away, where it will either be immediately used or stored in bunkers above the building. The thought ofhaving so much coal above my head scared me.Imagine the consequences my clothes would have 
suffered if several tons had rained down on me.Water purification: The water used to feed the 
boilers must be purified and softened before trav­elling via pipes to the boilers. I gave up on chem­istry freshman year, so the sophisticated sounding chemical, Zeolite, held no meaning for me — supposedly it is used to soften the water.
Once the water is put into the feedpump it goes out to the boilers. Thecondensate from the steam that comes 
back is saved and reused because it is much finer and softer than the purified city water.
The water used in the boilers is also tested in a room that smells very much like a photo lab ... ahh, that pungent aroma! The layperson (like myself) 
would have difficulty understanding whatall ofthe chemicals in test tubes up against a wall are used for.The controlling of the boilers and what happens inside the boilers: 
The “readers” near the boilers measure how much water is being pumped into each boiler and how much of a “load” of coal, gas, or oil is in the boiler. There is a “heartbeat” system that controls every boiler.The inside of the boilers are perfect examples of what Dante’s Inferno might have looked like. The fires inside the bellies are vicious, almost tearing away at the coal instead of burning it. Thinking that 
pain built character, I put my face up close to a window in a boiler. I pulled away quickly though, since burn blisters were not on my agenda for the day.
I never thought I could be interested in any­thing besides progressive music my parents hated, art I actually understand, and take-out Chinese food. I was sadly mistaken. Taking a tour of the Bellefield Boiler Plant introduced me to something I’ve always taken advantage of. Here at school, I 
complain when there’s no heat and I complain when there is heat. I never stopped to think that there were people who worked so hard to try and meet my demands. I never knew there were so many pipes, boilers, and coal shipments involved. 
And they’re just a block away from Buznudder’s.

Steam tunnels and waterbeds share the same sentence
“Far more university graduates 
are becoming criminals every year 
than are becoming policemen. ”
— Philip Goodhart
“We were walking along, and there were those chairs with 
desks that they have in classrooms. I looked and there was one, 
two, and in the third one, there was someone sitting there.” 
“John” was in trouble — the person in the chair was a 
security officer, and the place where he was walking was the 
steam tunnels, Carnegie Mellon’s forbidden zone.
Nobody knows how many people have ventured into the 
steam tunnels over the years, but John was one of the 
approximately 10 people a year who was unlucky enough to 
get caught.
And bad luck is exactly what happened here, according to 
John’s friend “Clint,” who was also apprehended that night. 
“She says she heard us making noise down there, but that’s 
just not possible,” he said. “Not only were we being really 
quiet, but whercshe was sitting was near a huge fan that was 
making tons of noise. Thinking back, she had to be taking a 
break down there, since she was reading a book and smoking 
a cigarette when we bumped into her. You can barely see 
people in the tunnels, much less hear them.”
“It actually looked like we were going to get off,” said 
John. “The officer who found us was joking around a little 
about it and generally being pretty cool. When she radioed our 
names in, the dispatcher asked her if she was going to need 
citations, because they don’t carry them, and she said, ‘That’s 
a negative.’ Then another voice came on the other end — it 
must have been the commanding officer — and told her to 
wait for a car to bring the citations.”
“Bill” was another victim of circumstance. “We were 
taking all the precautions, dressed in black and wearing tennis 
shoes for less noise,” he said. “Unfortunately, there was 
another group of kids, obviously semi-inebriated, who were 
hanging around just inside the tunnels making a lot of noise. 
The Campus Police went looking for them, but they ended up 
finding us. Afterwards, we ratted on them, just because we 
were pissed at them for getting us caught.
“The police had blocked the exit, so I was leading us to a 
different exit when we heard the police in the tunnel” Bill 
continued. “We could have gotten away if we had really tried, 
but one of the girls with us went catatonic, and the guy with 
her stopped functioning, too. There are plenty of exits and 
plenty of places to hide down there ifyou don’t mind getting 
dirty, but I didn’t want to leave members of my ‘team’ behind, 
so I did the noble thing and stayed with them.”
Despite the threatening PR of the steam tunnels — The 
Wott/hints at expulsion while the Student Handbook promises 
“serious disciplinary action” •— the consequences of a bust 
aren’t all that bad. Trips to the steam tunnels come under 
Group One trespass offenses, punishable by a $25 to $50 fine. 
John and Clint received $50 fines each, while Bill received a 
$20 penalty. Clint suggests that isn’t strong enough.
“You know that they’re not going to expel large numbers 
of people, and S50 hasn’t got much deterrent value. A first 
offense in the steam tunnels is on the same level as ‘installation 
of waterbeds,’ ” said Clint with a smirk. “If they made a first 
offense SI00 or $200, no questions asked, that would prob­
ably keep a lot more people from going down there. I know 
it would for me.”
The ban on the steam tunnels revolves around three main 
issues, according to Jim LaPaglia, Carnegie Mellon’s director 
of security: danger, isolation, and security.
Opinions of our tunnel travelers vary on the issue of 
danger. According to Clint, “It’s wet down there and it’s 
really hot, so you could slip ifyou’rc not careful. There’s also 
lots of pipes and sharp objects and overhangs that you have to 
duck down there, but as long as you have your wits about you, 
you’ll be fine.”
“It would be a hard-hat area,” said John. “There are
• MtaJsevc . .
passages where you have to crawl, there are areas that are a 
maze of pipes, and some areas that require acrobatics to get 
into.”
Bill disagrees. “It’s not really unsafe, ifyou just have to 
have two ounces of common sense. If it’s smoking, sparking, 
or says ‘Do Not Touch,’ don’t touch it.”
The issue of isolation is big for two reasons, according to 
LaPaglia. “First of all, because it’s so isolated, someone could 
have an accident down there, and we wouldn’t find out for 
several days. Also we’re worried that people may use the 
tunnels more for social purposes, like drinking parties.”
Bill was a victim of the second of these reasons. “We later

found out that the other group of people who had 
made all the noise had been drinking and smoking 
pot down there,” he said.
The security issue is perhaps the most impor­
tant one. LaPaglia mentions the possibility of using 
the tunnels to bypass the locking system of a 
building that is closed at night. John and Bill also 
mentioned the accessibility of the steam lines, 
Andrew wiring, and power lines that comes with 
the steam tunnels. “You could really bring the 
campus to its knees just by jerking a few wires,” said 
Bill.
“If the University were really serious about this, 
they’d alarm all the doors and, if they caught 
someone, they could follow through and expel 
them,” said John. “I really feel this University gets 
off on this threat thing, like they do with the 
stringent alcohol policy and the blatant disregard 
for that policy in the fraternities.”
Taking into account the danger and illegality of 
going into the tunnels, why do our tunnel explorers 
do it? “They shouldn’t put it in The Word,” said 
Clint. “If they put it in The Word, then people will 
know about it and want to break into it. It’s not that 
big right now, but it comes and goes. I remember 
freshman year, it was the big thing for all the 
fraternities to do. There was even a HyperCard stack 
floating around campus of the maps of the steam 
tunnels, in pretty good detail.”
“I went down because of the fact that it was 
obviously such a wonderful experience that they 
had to threaten us with expulsion,” said Bill.
“It’s a campus tradition,” added John. “But 
more than that, it’s the idea ofthings underground, 
underground passages. Isn’t that the making of 
great stories?”

Buggy practice inside the steam tunnels?
“Life is short; live it up. ”
— Nikita Khrushchev
Word has it that the steam tunnels are the place 
to go for adrenalin-pumping exhilaration — a 
natural, glowing high that stems directly from 
rebellion. A paradise of graffiti, marks from the ages 
like cave paintings, so it looks like this school has 
been around longer than the legendary Pittsburgh 
rains.
Why has no one I’ve talked to — students and 
alumni alike — tried exploring the unknown, and 
experiencing the forbidden? At Walt Disney World 
in Orlando, Mickey Junkies (the Floridians who 
make the Magic Kingdom a habit) are always trying 
to sneak into the underground facilities, either with 
friends who work there or on their own. So, why is 
CMU so different?
Another question I have approached myself 
with, and have been unable to provide myself with 
an answer for, is why aren’t we using the steam 
tunnels anymore? Hugh Young, professor of phys­
ics and a CMU alumnus, says that the steam tunnels 
are not in use anymore because of the risks involved 
in walking through the tunnels.
The tunnels were blocked for legal student 
usage during the ’40s, before which time they were 
a popular way ofgetting from class to class when the 
weather was cold, or in any other way inhospitable
— a job that the first-floor hallway of 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 
seems to have taken on, at least in 
part.
Today, even though the tunnels 
are reportedly narrow, unbearably 
hot, and in places steep, I found 
some students who would like the 
tunnels to be renovated and rein­
stated as an acceptable passageway 
for the whole campus to use.
Sophomore Lori Hey, a biology 
major, loves the idea of using the 
underground network of hallways 
as an inter-building path. She and 
junior chemical engineering major 
Jamie Eaton think the steam tunnels 
should be re-opened to allow the 
students of today the same privilege 
students of yore were afforded. Al­
lowing students to use the tunnels 
would be “much better,” Hey feels.
Manuel Llinas, a senior chemis­
try major, says he doesn’t know much 
about the off-limits, underground
tunnels except that “they’re there,” but feels they 
have the potential to become an integral aspect of 
Carnegie Mellon campus life once more.
“Ifwe’rc not allowed in them on a regular basis, 
they should at least give incoming freshmen tours 
of [the tunnels],” Llinas suggests. A great part of 
CMU’s tradition and heritage would be unlocked, 
and its steam tunnels preserved.
Llinas goes on to suggest another way in which 
the steam tunnels could be put to use, “they could 
be a museum ... to display students’ artwork.” The 
humidity might be destructive to the actual pieces, 
but the concept seems valid enough.
Other ideas have been tossed around, too. 
Though narrow, the steam tunnels might provide 
a warmer buggy-practice space, or if expanded 
somewhat, might provide an adequate and even 
quiet lounge area in which to study.
Whatever potential the steam tunnels hold 
within their imperfect walls, the spirit o’ CMU as it 
stands wouldn’t permit anything interesting to 
evolve in the place. For many students, the tunnels 
represent an enigma too complicated to explore or 
too out-of-reach to cultivate. Although some stu­
dents do go into them, and a few students get 
caught, the legacy of the steam tunnels seems to be 
fading into myth. For, as MCS freshman Dave 
Stager explains, “They are quite illegal.”

What do you think of the food: For nachos 
they were edible.
Why did you decide to become a profes­
sor: I like to teach, I like the interaction with 
students, and I thought I could make a differ­
ence.
If there was anyone in the world you 
could meet, who would he/she be: Mikhail 
Gorbachev.
What’s your biggest fear from students:
That somehow I will negatively impact a 
student’s desire to learn.
What’s your biggest pet peeve: People who 
begin questions with “This is a dumb ques­
tion....” There arc no dumb questions that are 
honestly asked —¦ there are, however, a lot of 
dumb answers.
What’s your favorite Chinese food dish: 
General Tso’s chicken, extra spicy.
Name: Russell
Charles Walker 
Born: February 10,
1945
Position at CMU:
Senior Lecturer/As- 
sistant Department 
Head, Mathematics 
Courses you teach: 
21-121 Calculus and 
21-292 Operations
Research I.
Are you married? If so, what’s your 
spouse’s name: My wife’s name is Susan.
Do you have any children: Yes.
What are their names and ages: Dana, 2 
years, and Robert, 5 months.
What was your biggest complaint as an 
undergraduate: Probably the dorm food and 
one professor — see below.
What were the qualities of your favorite & 
%vorst professors: Probably myall time favor­
ite professor was Professor William Beyer. He 
was extremely clear in his lectures, interested in 
students, and conscientious in all aspects of 
teaching. Undoubtedly, the worst was a pro­
fessor who I had for an important undergradu­
ate mathematics course. It was clear that he 
had ability, but he was much more interested 
in humor and music in class and covered only 
a small portion of the syllabus. In retrospect, 
his class was too passive — we should have 
made our feeling regarding his class known 
much sooner.
Does it bother you when students sleep in 
class: Yes, it bothers me.
Does it bother you when students leave in 
the middle of your lectures: Yes, of course 
students occasionally do need to leave a class 
early for good reason, but in general I am 
concerned about the attitude of student to­
ward their course work and education in gen­
eral.
What’s the most bizarre article of cloth­
ing you’ve ever worn to one of your classes: 
I’m afraid that I am pretty conventional where 
choosing clothing for classes is concerned. I 
did once give a review session on my way to a 
ballet wearing a dark blue three piece suit. Not 
bizarre, but a little unwise given the depth of 
the chalk dust in most of our classrooms.
What’s your favorite food: My favorite 
main course is a Japanese dish, Chicken Yakitori; 
my favorite dessert item is cheese cake.
What’s your favorite movie: Casablanca, 
Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Star Trek IV: The 
Voyage Home.
What’s your favorite book: My favorite 
books tend to vary over time. Of the recent 
ones, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton is 
clearly the favorite.
Who’s your favorite band/singer: Nat 
King Cole.
Who’s your favorite professional sports 
team: The Palmer Team — Arnie and his 
caddy Royce.

---------------------------------------------------

What three items could someone always 
find in your refrigerator: Sunflower seed 
butter, yogurt, and whole wheat bread.
What would be your idea of the ideal class 
to teach: A small section of calculus with 
highly motivated students.
What do you like most about your job: I 
think that the contact with students is the best 
part of my job.
If you had not been a professor, what do 
you think you would have done: I would 
have been a painter. But since my painting 
leaves much to be desired....
Do you ever at eat the Tartan Grill: I have 
occasionally eaten at the Tartan Grill, but 
never when Salads Plus is open. I think that 
cover the food in the Tartan.
Why did you decide to become a profes­
sor: I suspect that the main influence on my 
decision to become a professor was Professor 
Beyer and perhaps another of my undergradu­
ate professors, Professor Sam Selby. Positive 
experience with my first few classes also helped 
a lot.
If there was anyone in the world you 
could meet, who would he/she be: I’ll go for 
someone long dead and select Rembrandt van 
Rijn. I have read a great deal about him, and 
while much has been written, much is un­
known and is subject to debate. A good con­
versation would be fascinating and could also 
resolve many of the questions.
What’s your biggest fear from students: 
I’m concerned with the generally low level of 
motivation displayed by many students and 
the general level of preparation.
What’s your biggest pet peeve: I am con­
tinually dismayed by students who fail to take 
full advantage ofthcir educational opportunity 
here by missing classes, doing work less than 
their best, and generally apparently not taking 
full advantage of what the University has to 
offer.
What’s your favorite Chinese food dish: I
eat any type of Chinese food as long as it is not 
too spicy, but I think that Peking Duck is 
probably my all-time favorite.
Name: John F. 
Sturgeon 
Born: January 6,
1946 
Position at CMU: 
Associate Professor of 
Art Electronic Media/ 
Time-Base 
Courses you teach: 
Concept Studio II and 
Advanced Intermedia.
What was your biggest complaint as an 
undergraduate: Looking back I would say 
lack of perspective — the educational experi­
ence was not really put in context with life and 
creative issues.
What were the qualities of your favorite & 
worst professors: Favorite: ability to commu­
nicate in depth and to relate to me as an 
individual. Worst: burnt out.
Does it bother you when students sleep in 
class: Yes! the agreement is that we are both 
here together for this experience and AWAKE.
Does it bother you when students leave in 
the middle of your lectures: Yes, unless they 
have given an explanation which is under­
standable and agreeable.
What’s the most bizarre article of cloth­
ing you’ve ever worn to one of your classes: 
Nothing — in a performance participation at 
UCLA (1980) in a Media class.
What’s your favorite food: Home-made 
pumpkin pie from scratch!
What’s your favorite movie: This is an 
extremely difficult question since I am some­
what of a movie freak. I usually do not pick 
“favorites” but, I have lots of favorites in 
certain categories — however for the sake of 
this questionnaire I will say Last Tear at 
Marienbad.
What’s your favorite book: Same response 
as previous question. The book I use the most 
often is Astrological Ephemeris 1901-2000.
Who’s your favorite band/singer: Lou 
Reed and SUN-RK.
Who’s your favorite professional sports 
team: Raiders and Lakers.
What three items could someone always 
find in your refrigerator: Bread, butter, and 
olives.
What would be your idea of the ideal class 
to teach: Metaphysics and Video (Electronic 
Media) Art.
What do you like most about your job: 
Interactive communication about issues that 
concern and inform my life as well as students
If you had not been a professor, what do 
you think you would have done: As an artist, 
I view my profession was just that — artist. My 
job(s) over the years as professor, visiting artist, 
artist-in-rcsidence, commercial videographer, 
carpenter, truck-driver, or whatever, I view as 
support for my art work. Being a professor of 
art/electronic media, time-base is by far the 
best gig of the lot, because it maximizes my 
access to expensive electronic media technolo- 
gics and gives me time for personal research 
and art making. If I had not been an artist, I 
guess at this point I would have possibly be­
come an astrologer.
Do you ever at eat the Tartan Grill: Yes.
What do you think of the food: Some of 
the worst of all time.
Why did you decide to become a profes­
sor: Best wage — for the time — plus, I enjoy 
it.
If there was anyone in the world you 
could meet, who would he/she be: The one 
who could guide me to the heart of the mys­
tery!
What’s your biggest fear from students:
That they are too pessimistic for the global 
issues at hand (human and environment).
What’s your biggest pet peeve: Wasting my 
time.
What’s your favorite Chinese food dish:
Spice Hos, shrimp, and eggplant.
If there is a professor you would like us to profile 
next issue, ora question you would like us to ask, 
just drop us a noteat The Tartan office in Skibo,

Explore CMU’sarchitecturalwonders
Meandering through the campus of Carnegie Mellon, one 
is at once overwhelmed by its elegant architectural beauty, 
until one realizes that one has gotten lost and is actually at Pitt. 
Returning to campus, one has to contend with a collection of 
structures as appealing to the eye as the prospect of jabbing it 
repeatedly with a rusty syringe.
Now CMU is indeed a haven for academic innovation, 
where scientific achievement is only a stone’s throw away (you 
may want to verify this by throwing stones at some of your 
professors). We’ve developed a fully autonomous naviga­
tional vehicle capable of getting into an auto wreck without 
human intervention, and a computer so advanced that it was 
able to play chess with Kasparov on national TV and have a 
nervous breakdown just like a real person would. And don’t 
forget about the drama department’s top-secret upcoming 
production of Beckett’s Play Without Characters.
Given that these breakthroughs are springing up every­
where like panicked gophers in an earthquake, one imagines 
that the Persons of Wisdom at CMU would need a place to 
keep them, grand citadels of academe whose structure reflects 
the significance of their purpose. Why then have they insisted 
on coloring every building Mildew Green or that particular 
shade of yellow found only 
on the teeth ofpampered tcn- 
year-oldsr Let us take a guided 
tour of our hallowed campus 
and see if we can A) find out 
what the hell “hallowed” 
means, and B) discover the 
true nature of our scholastic 
edifices.
We start our journey at 
Uncle Sam’s Subs in Oak­
land, where we will remain 
for several hours in an at­
tempt to procrastinate until 
our editor phones us and re­
minds us that this column is 
due tomorrow and that he has a gun.
We hastily proceed to CMU, and find that the first 
building we see is Wean Hall. We dismiss smartass observa­
tions that the only way this is possible is by wandering around 
campus with our eyes shut until we end up at Wean, by 
pointing out that this is what most CMU students actually do 
throughout their academic careers.
Wean Hall is located in a grassy stretch called the Mall, 
thus named in a crude attempt to equalize the divergent male- 
.to-female ratio. Wean Hall, we notice, is mysteriously gridded 
with holes, as if it was a bystander in a particularly well- 
choreographed shootout. Many speculate the holes were 
drilled into the building’s side to provide some fresh air for the 
CS/Math majors within, most of whom are still working on 
last semester’s 15-412 final.
The truth is that they’re there because the Board of 
Trustees at one point announced it would be a great idea to 
cover Wean with bathroom tiles, so that it would resemble a 
huge washtub with an inconspicuous radar dish on top. The 
project was abandoned halfway through when someone dis­
covered that the idea hadn’t come from the Board of Trustees 
at all, but had been suggested as a joke on a Teacher
Evaluation form.
The nearby Baker Hall is home base of the school of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, and is thus regarded by the 
rest of the University population as largely expendable. The 
long, sloping corridor running through the ground floor 
dates back to when Andrew Carnegie, unsure of the fledgling 
University’s future, decided that should the school fail, he 
could reopen Baker Hall as a primitive amusement park ride. 
A plaque on the third floor reads “My Heart is in the Work,” 
a quote often misattributed to Carnegie, but that actually 
came from an employee at one of his factories, who lost several 
internal organs to the unsafe machinery.
We next saunter to Skibo, which won an award several 
years ago for its remarkable resemblance to a respiratory 
infection. The University has been promising to demolish our 
student center for years, claiming that delays were due to lack 
of funding. The truth of the matter is that Skibo is magically 
protected by Quoozleflah, the Incan god of Hideously Ugly 
Buildings, so that any demolition machinery that comes 
within fifty yards of Skibo mysteriously breaks down. At the 
last obliteration attempt, the foremen became so disgusted 
with losing yet another steamplow that they turned around 
and tore down the GSIA building. As a result, GSIA rose two 
points in the rankings among the nation’s business schools, 
and the University managed to cover up the whole affair by 
pretending that it was intentional.
Presently we come to the CFA building, an awe-inspiring 
structure built in the style of an older era, an age fraught with 
ancient cultures and civilizations who had no plumbing and an 
average life expectancy of twelve. A bronze plaque in the vast 
interior hallways sums up the philosophy of the institution: 
“Ours Is a Preparation for a 
Profession and a Wav of Life 
Rather Than a Means of Ac­
quiring a Few Quick Tricks of 
the Trade.” Latin scholars will 
note that this phrase trans­
lates as “I wish I could get a 
real job.”
The CFA building, despite 
popular misconceptions, was 
designed by Andrew Carn­
egie with the thought that if 
the University should fail, it 
could be converted into a low- 
cost Haunted House. It is no 
coincidence that the hallways 
are full of statues of decapitated philosophers, disembodied 
goat heads, and women staring at horror at sawed-off arms. 
This reflects Carnegie’s attempt to install the building with 
grotesque items capable of scaring off even the most staunch 
visitors, a tradition which is carried on today by CMU’s art 
students.
We end our tour by turning to a veiy special dorm, 
regarded as the pinnacle of comfort and spaciousness by the 
people who write freshmen housing application forms. 
Hamersehlag House is unique in that it inspires a special 
camaraderie among its residents. Few sights are as moving as 
a group of’Schlag inmates standing out in the cold during a 
fire drill and praying in unison for the fire to be real.
There are many other worthy institutions, such as the 
Navy building, that merit our attention, but that we shall not 
mention here because we just remembered that our name will 
be on this article. A study of their merits will be left as an 
exercise for the reader.
Tartan Senior Staffvriter Mike Shapiro is a junior Cogni­
tive Science major who is going to steer clear of architecture 
majors for the next few weeks.
Skibo is 
magically 
protected by 
the lean god 
of Hideously 
Ugly
Buildings.

Black History Month
Should raise awareness year round
Violence as a way of achieving racial 
justice is both impractical and immoral. 
It is impr0ctical because it is a 
descending spiral ending in destruction 
for all. The old law of an eye for an eye 
leaves everybody blind. It is immoral 
because it seeks to humiliate the 
opponent rather than win his 
understanding; it seeks to annihilate 
rather than convert. Violence is 
immoral because it thrives on hatred 
rather than love. It destroys community 
and males brotherhood impossible. It 
leaves s)dety in monologue rather than 
dialogue Violence ends by defeating 
itself. It creates bitterness in the 
survivo's and brutality in the 
destrovers.

We have more to celebrate 
about African American 
heritage than can be shoved 
into February each year. We 
have more to be concerned 
about, too.
Inside, two African Americans

pride and concerns about their 
heritage and history with the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
When you're finished reading

I think there are plenty of good people 
in America, but there are also plenty of 
bad people in America and the bad 
ones are the ones who seem to have all 
of the power and be in these positions 
to block things that you and I need. 
Because this is the situation, you and I 
have to preserve the right to do what is 
necessary to bring an end to that 
situation, and it doesn't mean that I 
advocate violence, but at the same 
time I am not against using violence in 
self-defense. I don't even call it 
violence when it's self-defense, I call it 
intelligence.

Bunznudders takes a bite out of yogurt boredom
By LAURA DAVIS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In need of a study break? Tired 
of the orange cream frozen yo­
gurt at Salads? Have an affec­
tion for things rich and sweet? 
Try Bunznudders, a gourmet ice 
cream and confection shop on 
South Craig Street. At first 
glance, this place might appear 
to be just another cutesy store in 
Trendsville, but Bunz is defi­
nitely worth another look.
Opened in December of 1990, 
Bunznudders is a much-appre- 
ciated addition to the Craig 
Street experience. Owned by 
three brothers, this distinctive 
“bakreamery” feels friendly and 
laid-back from the start.
Small white tables for two 
among numerous plants, are all 
set off by a wall-length mural, 
painted by two CMU students, 
depicting bug-eyed, cartoon 
cows in scenes of daily life on the 
farm, on the train, and in the 
kitchen.
The atmosphere is perfect for 
chatting with a friend or relax­
ing over some reading, but what 
enhances the experience is the 
wide array of sweets Bunz­
nudders has to offer. Ice cream 
and frozen yogurt are redefined
by this store. Made at Friend­
ship Farm, ice cream flavors 
ranging from ordinary chocolate 
and strawberry are taken to new 
heights of deliciousness, while 
uncommon flavors take the spot­
light. Almond praline and pea­
nut butter Grape Nuts crunch 
are among the imaginitive new 
taste combinations available.
The frozen yogurt, though, 
with its rich flavors, outshines 
the ice cream. Cookie dough, the 
most popular variety of yogurt, 
is heaven for people who like 
Tollhouse cookies better before 
they go into the oven. Other fa­
vorites include blueberry pan­
cake, chocolate bunz-nana, and 
mocha brownie dough. A num­
ber of these yogurts are lowfat, 
and a few are even nonfat (amaz­
ing!). In addition, any number of 
different toppings and cones are 
available. A bonus is that soft 
serve is possible for all ice creams 
and yogurts, an uncommon fea­
ture in most stores. Prices range 
from $1.29 for a single scoop to 
$2.39 for three scoops; hand- 
packed pints and quarts are also 
available at $3.50 and $5.50, 
respectively.
On the baked goods side, the 
store has a wide array of delec­
table items, all baked on the
premises. The cream cheese-gra­
ham pie is a cheesecake-lover’s 
dream, and sells for $1.25 per 
slice. Other types of pies include 
dark chocolate, pecan, apple, and 
pumpkin spice, and can be pur­
chased whole for $6.99. Fresh 
French baguettes, sourdough 
loaves, and other breads are 
baked every morning, along with 
muffins, cookies, and croissants.
For lunch croissants filled with 
everything from turkey and 
swiss to spinach and feta offer a 
nice alternative to the sandwich. 
Croissants can be filled with 
strawberries, raspberries, or al­
monds, and are of course avail­
able plain as well.
Bunznudders’ muffin selection 
is good; favorite varieties include 
cranberry, apple spice, and the 
old classic, blueberry, each sell­
ing for $1.10. Other treats to try: 
the double fudge brownie (rich, 
rich, rich!) and the white choco­
late macadamia nut cookie, 
which is unbeatable when 
coupled with a cup of gourmet 
coffee.
Gourmet coffee and other bev­
erages are a less-emphasized yet 
important part of the Bunz­
nudders experience. Each day a 
different selection of gourmet 
teas (all decaffeinated) and
coffees is available to complement 
the baked goods; other interest­
ing drinks offered are espresso, 
cappuccino, hot chocolate, 
spritzers, and mulled cider. For 
the less adventurous, soft drinks 
and nongourmet coffee can be 
purchased.
According to Bunznudders em­
ployee Ann Oliva, the store is 
busiest in the mornings for break­
fast and around 5 pm, when 
people stop in for a bite after 
work. The store is open every day 
at 8 am and stays open until 11 
pm Monday through Friday; Sat­
urday and Sunday it closes at 
midnight.
The ice creams and yogurts sell 
steadily all year, but it gets really 
busy when it’s warm out. For the 
most part, she added, all the 
baked goods are also popular with 
customers, selling soon after they 
come out of the oven.
Bunznudders is a conveniently 
located and refreshing place to go 
if you need to get away from cam­
pus, or if you are in the neighbor­
hood and are tempted to satisfy 
that craving for sweets. The prices 
are higher than average, but all 
the ingredients are high quality, 
making for delicious, rich, deluxe 
taste treats. (In other words, the 
extra money is worth it.)Kevin Chen/Tartan Photographer

GSO brews coffeehouse
Kevin Chen/Tartan Photographer
By LESLIE ZUBATY
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate 
Student Organization (GSO) 
announces the grand opening of 
a student-run coffeehouse this 
Thursday. The coffeehouse will 
be located next to the Tartan 
Grill in the former arcade room, 
with the video games moved to 
the Tartan Loggia, next to the 
Lounge. Graduate students and 
organizers of the coffeehouse 
project are very optimistic and 
excited about the prospect of 
having a “place to call their own.”
Engineering and Public Policy 
Graduate Student Peter Ash­
croft describes the coffeehouse 
as “more than just a recreational 
facility.” He feels it “will go a 
long way in helping graduate 
students to be a more cohesive 
body/’ According to Ashcroft, 
many graduate students share 
the feeling that they have very 
little opportunity to interact with 
one another, especially those 
belonging to the more isolated 
departments.
Funds that GSO had saved 
from past years gave it the op­
portunity to begin the coffee­
house as a place specifically 
geared toward the gathering of 
grad students. Ashcroft credits 
and thanks the Office of Student 
Affairs and Dean Michael 
Murphy for their help on the 
projept.
Organizers want to make it a 
pointlthat the coffeehouse is for 
the benefit of the entire CMU 
community, although the grand
na/ffmsOvvv 
l aii' lr nlF;/C 
ieOlsm?lrmisC
opening is restricted to gradu­
ate and commuter students. One 
intention is the accommodation 
of commuters; the coffeehouse 
will enable them with to feel 
more integrated into the cam­
pus community, as well as pro­
vide them another place to go 
during the day.
Because it is intended to be a
24 hour establishment, Ashcroft 
also hopes “it will make the cam­
pus a little more alive at night.” 
Of course, whether or not it re­
mains open 24 hours a day de­
pends on the demand of the cam­
pus.
Another demand of the CMU 
community, however, lies with 
those who prefer to study or re­
lax in the Tartan Lounge. The 
movement of the arcade has 
spurred a new problem among 
undergraduates who use the 
Tartan Lounge for studying.
Students hold differing view­
points regarding the move. Many 
feel that the movement of the 
arcade causes a distraction to 
those preferring to study in the 
lounge. Even though the video 
games themselves may not make 
an overly disruptive noise, the
extra activity and louder atmo­
sphere provide a bit of distrac­
tion.
Others are willing to accept 
the trade-off, when they realize 
the benefits that the new coffee­
house will bring about. General 
Arts Dean Pomona Valero com­
ments, “Most people that I see in 
the lounge, during the day at 
least, go there to sleep or just sit 
around between classes. I don’t 
really find the games very dis­
tracting anyway.”
GSO also faces the question of 
what will happen to the coffee­
house when Skibo is destroyed 
in order to build the new univer­
sity center. Ashcroft admits that 
accepting and putting money 
into the coffeehouse “was a bit of 
a gamble,” but explains that GSO 
decided that since most of the 
equipment is portable they could 
take' advantage of the opportu­
nity. “There was no point in 
waiting around, and the experi­
ence we get in running this place 
will enable us to have a future 
one,” he reasons.
The new coffeehouse will serve 
as a lounge for a short time, 
until all of the arrangements 
can be made to begin serving 
food. Planning the business to 
run as a “break-even” organiza­
tion, GSO stresses that in no 
way is the coffeehouse meant to 
compete with Scotland Yard, 
Dining Service, Entropy or Co­
op. GSO hopes to hold talks, 
musical events, meetings of spe­
cial groups, and other commu­
nity activities in its new estab­
lishment.

Judy advocates knowledge of pastOne student reflects on 
Malcolm X’s message
By ORYA DASNA
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
The room is barren. The walls 
are completely uncovered, with 
none of the clutter of a typical 
college professor. The conspicu­
ously tidy office looks as if it has 
n0t been moved into, even 
though it’s second semester. A 
single briefcase on the side is 
the only indication of an occu­
pant.
Alarge African American man 
greets me with a friendly man­
ner at the door. He is tall, with a 
well-groomed beard and a neat 
suit. His manner is relaxed, yet 
he maintains a definitive air of 
control. He is elusive; he refuses 
to be photographed, and while 
his voice barely rises above a 
whisper when the tape recorder 
is on, it booms sonorously the 
second he clicks the tape recorder 
off to say something off the 
record.
Ronald Judy is an assistant 
professor in the English Depart­
ment. He teaches two courses, 
Culture/Values/Texts and Social 
Rfealism and the Arab Novel. 
The aim of these two courses is 
to instill “a greater understand­
ing of the historical element of 
Arab nationalism and how it 
came about.”
Although he was baptized and 
raised as a Catholic, and the 
other members of his family are 
Christian, Judy converted to Is­
lam at the age of seventeen, when 
his father told him about the 
family’s roots in the western 
Sahara. “At that point, I was 
committed to wanting to reclaim 
my lost cultural heritage and 
the desire to go to al-Azhar to 
research past Islamic institu­
tions.”
Judy focuses on an area not 
commonly studied in the United 
States, the connection between 
the African and Arab cultures. 
“In my work, I focus upon an 
area of cultural production that 
is generally ignored, but is cul­
turally very significant, that I
call the African-Arab culture belt 
or the Sudani cultural belt. This 
spands from the Red Sea to the 
Atlantic.”
In addition to receiving his BA 
in Islamic philosophy and both 
his master’s and PhD degrees in 
comparative literature at the 
University of Minnesota, he 
spent five years training at the 
al-Azhar University, an Islamic 
seminary in Cairo, Egypt. “The 
most important thing that Egypt 
taught me was the almost end­
less possibility of being. All we 
are as historical subjects is some­
thing greater than the accident 
of our birth.”
Judy’s studies in Egypt ex­
panded his mind to the myriad 
of alternative explanations of 
history as he traditionally 
learned it. “[Egyptl made pos­
sible at a personal level and also 
at a political level to engage the 
different histories at a more in­
timate level. It challenges the 
notion of Western culture as the 
product of the unilinear devel­
opment of ideas. The West is not 
monolithic. There are a lot of 
Westernities. The African 
American [Westernity] ex­
presses a very pronounced Is­
lamic identity.”
Not only did Judy challenge 
the traditional theories of Ameri­
can hi story in his studies abroad, 
he scrutinized the basis of Ameri­
can society — social constructs. 
“The principle agenda of most 
American communities is to­
wards finding a concrete basis, 
an ideal for social justice; [this] 
basis isn’t grounded in history. 
Islam offers them a way of think­
ing about social justice that isn’t 
specifically Western. That is, 
frankly, for me, revolutionary 
and liberating. We think of Is­
lam as totalitarian, but it is the 
opposite, in fact.”
Indeed, Judy’s past history 
plays a significant role in influ­
encing his views on Black His­
tory Month. He believes that the 
founder of Black History Month, 
Carter T. Woodson, did so “to 
compensate for what he rightly 
perceived as an absence of the 
contribution of African Ameri­
cans. Sadly, today, the case still 
is that when most people think 
of American history, they don’t 
think of African Americans.” 
Criticizing the prevalent lack 
of knowledge of Americans about 
the realm of African American 
achievements in history, Judy 
says, “Take for example, the rail­
roads. I have relatives who were 
porters. I have relatives whose 
fathers had helped build the rail­
roads with the Chinese. Who 
built the infrastructure of the 
country?
“When you begin to look care­
fully at how things we take for 
granted came about, we realize 
that the United States has al­
ways been the product of mul­
tiple cultures. Until we under­
stand that, we need to continue 
having African American his­
tory months, Asian American 
history months.”
Judy was made acutely aware 
of the conspicuous omission of 
African Americans from the 
study of American history when 
he was exposed to other cultures’ 
perceptions of American history.
“One of the things that I en­
countered in Egypt was the ex-

tent to which the general his­
tory of America is presented as 
being all white. All around the 
world they view African Ameri­
cans as being a side of American 
history. We need a month, still, 
because that common history 
which keeps us outside of his­
tory is still being taught. Now I 
would like to see when we talk 
about American history, we talk 
about everybody’s contribu­
tions.”
He is also concerned about the 
types of information being 
taught to his children in school. 
“Eventually the message will be 
delivered and we’ll start to re­
think American history so that 
hopefully my children’s children 
or your children’s children when 
they get to study history at 
school, will study all the history.
“My son is in the public school 
system in Pittsburgh and he’s 
not learning American history. 
He’s learning the history that I 
learned, which is the Pilgrims 
came.... This month he’s learn­
ing about African American his­
tory.”
As far as Carnegie Mellongoes, 
Judy believes that the Univer­
sity also has a significant amount 
to do in terms of achieving the 
ideal of an inclusive historical 
education. “CarnegieMellonhas 
a lot of work to do. The first issue 
that has to be made is to recog­
nize that there is a lot of work to 
be done and how to go about 
addressingitfrom here. Ifthere’s 
no recognition that there’s work 
to be done, there’s no recogni­
tion that there is a problem. You 
have to recognize the need.”
Judy does acknowledge that 
some attempt has been made by 
the University. “There are four 
tenure track African Americans; 
two of them are in English, two 
of them are in history. That 
marks that those two depart­
ments are working. The four of 
us are committed, as well as 
others, but English and history 
are not the entire CMU.”
Although Judy is adamant 
about hiring individuals who are 
competent in their fields, he is 
also a strong advocate of hiring 
more multicultural persons. “I 
think CMU has a lot more to do 
in terms ofhiring African Ameri­
cans, hiring Hispanics. I hon­
estly don’t know why it’s not 
happening.” In regard to the 
proliferation of Asians and Asian 
Americans in the faculty and 
staff, Judy feels that it is not a 
sufficient representation of all 
minorities. “The hiring of Asian 
Americans is a valid thing to do, 
but it is not the equivalent of 
hiring African Americans. They 
. bothneedtobedone,andthey’re 
not interchangeable.”
“We need, I think, to recog­
nize more clearly and more de­
finitively the need to address 
this problem. I’m confident that 
this institution has the capacity 
to do so. There’s a lot of work to 
be done. What the future will be,

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The month of February is a 
time of remembrance for the 
great Black leaders who have 
helped to mold our way of 
thinking today. Their ongo­
ing struggle for equality and 
Black self-worth is definitely 
worth remembering.
Blacks, throughout history, 
have been forced to believe 
that in order to see them­
selves as a part of humanity, 
they have had to achieve a 
sense of whiteness and be 
integrated into a Eurocentric 
society. However, during the 
Civil Rights era (the late 
1950s and early ’60s), the no­
tion of integration that Mar­
tin Luther King Jr. proposed 
was obliterated by a single 
man. This man became the 
leader for the growing skep­
ticism among Blacks about 
the worth of integrating into 
the mainstream Eurocentric 
society and the catalyst for 
the movement known as “pro- 
Black.”
Born Malcolm Little in 
Omaha, Nebraska on May 19, 
1925, Malcolm X was the 
fourth child of Earl and 
Louise Little. Malcolm’s radi­
cal perceptions and senti­
ments were instilled in him 
early on by his father, who 
was also committed to the 
justice and dignity of Blacks. 
Malcolm’s father, a national­
ist in his own right, was mur­
dered by white supremacists 
when Malcolm was six years 
old.
Imagine that — a country 
that’s supposed to be a de­
mocracy, supposed to be for 
freedom and all that kind of 
stuff when they want to draft 
you and put you in the army 
and send you to Saigon to 
fight for them—andthenyou 
have to turn around and all 
night long discuss how you’re 
going to just get a right to 
register and vote without be­
ing murdered.
—• Malcolm X
Malcolm later worked as a 
hustler in Boston and in New 
York before he was sentenced 
to prison in 1946 for burglary. 
While in prison, Malcolm was 
introduced to the Nation of 
Islam, a faith originating in 
Africa. The Nation of Islam 
that Malcolm X supported 
encompasses the teachings of 
unification, self-love, self- 
knowledge, and self-defense 
for the Black race.
Malcolm soon found him­
self enriched by the teach­
ings of Islam, and changed 
his last name to X, to signify 
the loss of his African family
name as a result of the Black 
slave trade. Malcolm quickly 
ascended through the ranks of 
the Nation of Islam to become 
its chief representative and 
spokesperson. Malcolm’s in­
credibly strong and proud ap­
pearance created a new and 
more potent vision of the Black 
Leader. Many compared him 
to Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.; however, unlike King, 
Malcolm was not intent on 
recruiting or persuading lib­
eral whites to join his crusade.
I prefer the candor of the 
southern segregationalist to the 
hypocrisy of the northern 
integrationalist... By joining 
you they strangle your mili­
tant efforts toward freedom, 
toward justice, toward equal­
ity.
— Malcolm X
Malcolm delivered from the 
Black point of view, and in­
formed Blacks about their en­
emies, so thatin their struggle 
for equality they would know 
who they were fighting 
against. Malcolm’s style of 
speaking was as important as 
the content of his message. He 
was angry, and his anger re­
flected the passion and love he 
had for his people, which, in 
turn, informed the audience of 
his logic and insight.
Malcolm’s speeches were 
completely intended to arouse 
the pride and joy of being 
Black. Malcolm instilled in 
Blacks an admiration for their 
history, beliefs, culture, ide­
als and, most importantly, 
themselves. Instead of trying 
to imitate and acquire white­
ness and its ideals, Malcolm 
projected a new feeling of hu­
manity.
The evolution of the idea that 
Blacks are not human unless 
they are intermingling with 
whites and the white standard 
was coming full circle. This 
was Malcolm’s primary objec­
tive and greatest gift: to en­
hance the caliber of Black 
self-worth, independent of 
their associations with 
whites...
As soon as the white man 
hears a Black man say that 
he’s through loving white 
people, then the white man 
accuses the black man of hat­
ing him. The white man has 
brainwashed himself into be­
lieving that all the Black people 
in the world want to be cuddled 
up next to him. What I want to 
know is how the White man, 
with the blood of Black people 
dripping off his fingers, can 
have the audacity to be asking 
Black people “do they hate 
him?”
— Malcolm X

Thin wallet? Thin clothes? Get thrifty!
aNgy.l :6 igrUm0 IosM gl mrymrsor g66.esCmls .P Nolsgum gl0 lmI ry.sMm6h 
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Staffwriter

With the difficulties in the 
economy, the constant, over­
whelming cost of education, the 
unfortunate necessity of eat­
ing, and the expense of good 
beer, there might not be a whole 
lot of money left in your wallet 
for life’s other necessities, like 
clothes. In the face of this di­
lemma, you can always choose 
to do what’s been trendv for 
years: thrift shopping.
In some circles, wearing 
what’s out of style has, for a 
long time, been considered to 
be the cutting edge of fashion. 
If your clothes have been get­
ting as thin as your wallet, sev­
eral options in thrift shopping 
are available right down Forbes 
Avenue. The two that seem to 
represent the opposite ends of 
the thrift spectrum are just off 
Forbes on Atwood Avenue and 
within reasonable walking dis­
tance.
The first option, on the high 
end of the spectrum, is Avalon 
Clothing, an old familiar to 
many students. Avalon is on 
Atwood, between Forbes and
Fifth, across from the new Uni­
versity Beverage Center. For the 
uninitiated, this trendy store 
was once a center for military 
surplus goods ranging from 
parachuting jump pants to army 
rucksacks.
Right now, Avalon has a lot of 
new stuff mixed in with the old. 
A lot of the military surplus is 
still mixed in with the worn over­
coats, corduroy blazers, and silk 
pajama parts, but now there are 
previously unworn shirts, jeans, 
outerwear, and Doc Martens. 
You can also buy hip sunglasses 
and some leather belts that 
might make you a little nervous 
— or, if you’ve got a good imagi­
nation, excited.
It always seemed that part of 
the fun of thrift shopping is the 
challenge of scrounging around 
for something appealing. Unfor­
tunately, scrounging in Avalon 
now is about as much fun as 
going through the ultra-trendy 
specialty stores at a mall. And 
like the specialty stores, most of 
the merchandise comes in one of 
two colors. In the case of Avalon, 
it’s olive-drab green or just plain 
black.
Other colors do show up, how-
lars; at the Operatunity Shop, 
you could buy a whole suit or 
two whole suits, for the same 
amount of money—that is a big 
price difference.
Either way, going to the vin­
tage stores are cheaper than 
heading out to Monroeville and 
the mall. Stuff is generally 
cheaper at Avalon, it is always 
cheaper at The Operatunity 
Shop, and there isn’t the hassle 
or expense of a PAT bus; you can 
walk. Your clothes may still be 
thin, but by thrift shopping, 
maybe your wallet won’t.... Well, 
at least not as fast.

ever, near the other end of the 
thrift spectrum. The Opera 
tunity Shop is also located on 
Atwood Avenue, away from 
Forbes and Fifth Avenues past 
the Decade, and is about as dif­
ferent from Avalon as it can be. 
The Operatunity Shop is much 
more fun, it’s a lot cheaper, and 
it’s real scrounging. At the 
Operatunity shop, three floors 
stack themselves for one’s 
scrounging pleasure, as opposed 
to Avalon’s one: men’s and kids’ 
clothing on the second floor, 
women’s on the first, and furni­
ture in the basement. The 
Operatunity Shop has knick- 
knacks and old books, too.
Probably the best part of the 
Operatunity Shop is the fact that 
none of its clothing is new, but 
all donated by the supporters of 
the Pittsburgh Opera, and all 
profits go back to support the 
opera. You get something good, 
and dosomethinggood,too.The 
clothes are all out of style, but 
only mainstream style. In one 
way or another, it has all been 
worn by somebody else before. 
The second best part is that stuff 
is really cheap. At Avalon, a shirt 
can easily cost over thirty dol-aNgy.l Bolsgum by.sMolu 6s.em Pmgsnem6 gl geeg, .P PygCv.,gls som6h

DIVERSIONS
Forbes Gallery exhibits bulletproof art
By BARBARA REYES
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
& MARNI BOREK
Tartan Diversions Editor
Like many of the smaller gal­
leries in Pittsburgh and other 
major cities, CMU’s Forbes Gal­
lery serves as an outlet of ex­
pression for young, fairly un­
known artists. Art students are 
given the opportunity to exhibit 
their work here. Some of their 
pieces have deep symbolic mean­
ing. Others are products of the 
release of emotions. The pieces 
produced under either of these 
circumstan-ces 
are often times 
magnificent and 
deserve recogni­
tion.
Four senior art­
ists, Fred Baxter,
Matthew Hol­
land, Dana 
Martinelli, and 
Michael Rodgers 
will be showing at 
the Forbes Gal­
lery starting this 
Monday. Each 
artist has a 
unique style that 
is definitely 
worth looking at.
Baxter uses 
many different 
means for creat­
ing an art piece.
This is known as 
“non-medium 
specific.” One of 
the sculptures he 
will be displaying 
this week is a 
rusted chair with 
a photograph 
placed on the 
backrest.
Some of the 
black and white
illustrations Baxter will be 
showing make strong political 
statements. He says that he uses 
his artwork as a vehicle to sati­
rize the importance people place 
on time and money. This is defi­
nitely evident in his drawings. 
He shows the effects of human 
materialism on both nature and 
people themselves.
A self-portrait piece will also 
be displayed at the gallery. The 
painting features complimen­
tary blocks of color — blue and 
orange being most dominant. 
The paint was applied to a “bul-. 
let-proof’ surface, a metal slab.
Fred Baxter
A very striking work that 
Baxter will be displaying is his 
photo portrait piece. There is 
white paint smeared across the 
eyes of this piece’s subject, 
which, according to Baxter, sym­
bolizes the human need for vi­
sion.
“Many cultures believe that 
eyes are important because they 
allow you to see through a 
person’s soul,” 
explains Baxter.
Holland has 
generated two- 
dimensional 
pieces — more 
specifically, 
paintings — for 
his show. He is 
very influenced 
by life experi­
ences and his 
. work is very per­
sonal. In the past, 
Holland has 
worked mostly 
towards creating 
barren apocalyp­
tic landscapes, 
but he has slowly 
incorporated fig­
ures into his 
works in order to 
allow audiences 
to relate better to 
his art.
“With the fig­
ure, there is more 
association ra­
ther than with 
other symbols 
and icons be­
cause there is 
more identifica­
tion,” says Hol­
land.
Dark, dull, or morbid colors 
such as ochres, white, and black 
dominate Holland’s canvases. In 
one of the paintings that will be 
hung in the gallery, an angular 
figure is enveloped in a black 
background. Holland says the 
painting represents “despera­
tion and time on his hands.” His 
bases for the figures in the paint­
ings are unrealistic.
“The figures in the paintings 
are contorted and twisted. They 
are in unrealistic positions that 
are physically impossible. It’s a 
metaphor for life. Life is over­
whelming.”
Martinelli will display oil 
paintings and sculptures in the 
gallery. There is no particular 
theme in his work, but some of 
his pieces deal with what he 
calls “junk as icons.” He will also 
be showing two landscapes of 
nearby Homestead, where he 
lives.
For his show, Rodgers will be 
exhibiting several paintings, il­
lustrations, and a sculpture. His 
paintings are imagery-based, 
progressing from pencil sketches 
to the final painted project. 
Rodgers’ paint color schemes are 
usually bright and intense; he 
uses yellow most frequently in 
his paintings to make it appear 
as if light is coming through the 
canvas.
In his work, Rodgers concen­
trates on distorting his human 
subjects. The facial features in 
his painting of men playing cards 
and his sculpture of a head look 
as if they were molded and 
twisted up against bone and
muscle.
Another interesting feature of 
Rodgers’ work is that he will 
depict his human subjects with­
out eyes.
“The space is empty. It’s look­
ing into a person’s head rather 
than into the eyeball.”
One of Rodgers’ main foci is 
on the human skeleton, which 
shows up in many of his illus­
trations.
“A skeleton is a more ‘real’ 
representation of a person be­
cause the human face is a mask. 
It’s almost like skin is a candy 
coating that can be removed,” 
says Rodgers.
With the different techniques 
and conceptions of the artists, 
the show at Forbes Gallery prom­
ises to be thought provoking.
CMU Drama rains mediocrity on audience
By MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Contributing Editor
Since they first came into ex­
istence, musicals have been 
hokey. Because the whole idea 
of breaking into song in the midst 
of dialogue and “drama” is corny, 
an entire genre based on this 
concept is bound to be, too. While 
some musicals have fought 
against this fundamental 
cheesiness, most shows, espe­
cially the ones written before 
Andrew Lloyd Weber started to 
do his thing, give the corny free 
reign.
I have nothing against musi­
cals. If they’re done well, they 
can be some of the most enter­
taining, satisfying productions 
around. But the best ones don’t 
just use the hokiness, they cel­
ebrate it — they point out how 
sometimes we feel like breaking 
into song and dance in the middle 
of the street; how, at times, life 
can be as candy-coated as what 
we see on stage. The CMU 
Drama Department’s production 
of 110 in the Shade has the po­
tential to be a wonderful little 
celebration of life’s corny nature, 
but some artistic and technical 
problems hold it back. 110 in 
the Shade, written by Tom Jones 
and Harvey Schmidt (who also 
wrote The Fantasticks), is based 
on N. Richard Nash’s play The 
Rainmaker. It takes place in a 
small Western town during a 
summer drought. The main ac­
tion of the play concerns young 
Lizzie Curry and her dreams of 
love. Her father and brothers all 
attempt to find her a husband 
who thinks she is as wonderful 
as they do.
At the beginning of the show, 
Lizzie is returning from a trip 
designed to find her a man. Of 
course, the trip was unsuccess­
ful. Her family invites File, the 
sheriff and the man Lizzie cares 
most for, to a picnic. He refuses,
but the family goes on with its 
plans anyway.
During the picnic, the Rain­
maker, a.k.a. Bill Starbuck, ar­
rives with promises of rain for 
the town within 24 hours if Mr. 
Curry gives him $100. His 
scheme takes the entire town in, 
all except Lizzie and her older, 
practical brother, Noah. Lizzie 
and Starbuck end up together, 
but not before she and File have 
a meaningful conversation.
At the end of the play, File 
discovers that Starbuck is a 
fraud. Star-buck begs Lizzie to 
go with him, and File begs her to 
stay. Of course I’m not going to 
tell you who she picks, but by 
this point in the play, her deci­
sion comes as no surprise.
The play is sappy but sweet 
and really quite funny at times. 
There are only a few points 
where it descends into depths 
from which it cannot be rescued
— about halfway through the 
first act, Noah freaks out and 
the family becomes majorly dys­
functional — but if you try re­
ally hard, you can ignore these 
moments. The music is 
unobtrusive and pretty, even 
though it does sound an awful 
lot like The Fantasticks. Overall 
the show is pretty solid. It has 
love, dreams, and the mystery of 
magic—all the ingredients nec­
essary to whip up a charming, if 
somewhat fluffy, show.
Unfortunately, CMU’s produc­
tion obscures some of the most 
wonderful parts of the show, 
though it does manage to illumi­
nate a lot of them, too. First of 
all, I have to say that Emily 
Skinner was incredible as Lizzie. 
She knocked my socks off. Her 
voice was beautiful, her acting 
was believable, and I could re­
ally see her transformation from 
a plain girl to a beautiful woman.
I can’t say enough about her. 
She was perfect.
Most of the other performers 
looked good, too. Jeffrey Shore, 
as Lizzie’s father, H.C., was won­
derful as a sweet, down-to-earth 
man — I wanted to hug him in 
almost every scene he was in. 
Michael Fuller was strong,
though a little more abrasive 
than necessary, as Noah. 
Michael Lucas played the Rain­
maker, and, although he wasn’t 
quite as magical as I wanted 
him to be, I liked him. The cho­
rus, played by the sophomore 
musical theater class, was en­
chanting.
Though there were no bla­
tantly bad performances in the 
show, some could use a little 
adjustment. Lizzie’s younger 
brother, Jimmy Curry, played 
by Walter Elder, was cute and 
made me laugh whenever he ap­
peared, but I never believed him.
Elder’s performance was a little 
too close to being a caricature 
for me to take him seriously. 
Beth Zumann’s Snookie had the 
same problem. Both characters 
were charming, but completely 
unbelievable. Chadley 
Kelderman sang his role of File 
beautifully, but his acting left a 
lot to be desired. He just didn’t 
have any expression, especially 
when he was singing.
Let me preface my discussion 
of the technical problems with 
the show by saying that I did see 
it on a preview night, and I’m 
sure that most of these glitches
FmPPme, VM.em gl0 -Coy, VUollme 6Mgem g T.,.n6 C.Cmls ol 110 in the Shade.
were fixed before opening night. 
The biggest technical problem 
with the show was the rain 
wagon, Starbuck’s truck, which 
was supposed to roll on and off 
stage. At one point, though, the 
truck got stuck and stage hands 
had to come on stage and cajole 
the thing back into the wings. 
There was an inordinate amount 
of noise backstage at times. The 
flats were too narrow; from my 
seat five rows back, four or five 
seats to the left of the house, I 
could see the run crew and cast 
buzzing around backstage.
The direction of the show was 
all right. Nothing stuck out as 
being either wonderful or ter­
rible. Too bad I can’t say the 
same thing about the choreog­
raphy, which fluctuated between 
okay and just plain awful. I guess 
it was at its best during the 
recurring rain theme, which had 
some really cool moves, though 
the part where the entire cast 
lumps together and bobs up and 
down is more than a little remi­
niscent of the “Cool” scene from 
West Side Story. But it bottomed 
out in the Act II opener, where it 
got so sappy and disgustingly 
sweet that I was almost ill.
One more thing about the pro­
duction bothered me — the pro­
grams. If you’ll notice, I don’t 
refer to any songs by their names 
in this article. That’s because 
there was no breakdown of the 
musical numbers in the pro­
gram. The entire Drama Depart­
ment faculty was listed, but not 
the musical numbers.
The show was good overall. 
It’s entertaining, and although 
I’ve listed a lot of problems here, 
somehow the production rises 
above them to be a charming 
reiteration of the “I’m OK — 
you’re OK” theme. Yes, it’s 
cheesey, but, hey, so is life some­
times. If you let yourself go, you’ll 
probably enjoy the show. And I 
guesfc; that’s what it’s all about.

One of Coppelia's appeals is 
that it is more than a love story. 
The ballet displays the conflict 
between idealism and reality 
— art and life. Dr. Coppelius 
and Franz are trapped by the 
beauty they see in the doll.
Coppelius and Franz equate 
beauty with “good.” This type of 
conception shows that the char­
acters have trouble distinguish­
ing what is real and what is not. 
The ballet teaches audiences 
that idealism stems from youth­
ful naivity and that maturity 
brings forth the acceptance of 
reality.
This light-hearted fable will 
not only enchant audiences with 
its story, but with the music 
score as well. The melodious 
and rich music not only accom­
panies the plot perfectly, but 
also lends a guiding hand in the 
dance movements performed on 
stage. The music attunes audi­
ences to the emotions the danc­
ers express through their move­
ments. It is obvious that at the 
time when Coppelia was cre­
ated, the choreographer and 
composer worked closely to pro­
duce a desired effect. Famous 
ballets by Tchaikovsky and 
Stravinsky would not be suc­
cessful if it weren’t for this.
With the talent of the Pitts­
burgh Ballet Theatre, the beau­
tiful storyline, and dynamic 
music, Coppelia is destined to 
be as successful at the Benedum 
Center as it was in many places 
around the world. And you can 
grab that hero sandwich on the 
way to see it.

There is always that great 
debate about what to do on 
Valentine’s Day. While the 
Original Hot Dog Shop and Sub­
way might be great culinary 
treats for loved ones, an engag­
ing musical performance may 
add more quality to the day.
Coppelia, one of the most fa­
mous comedic ballets of all time, 
is being performed by the Pitts­
burgh Ballet Theatre February 
13!through 16 at the Benedum 
Center and is a perfect way of 
showing that special someone 
he or she means more than 
french fries and a meatball hero.
The three-act ballet Coppelia 
was adapted from a Gothic tale 
by E.T.A. Hoffman, a 19th cen­
tury writer. The story centers
around the eccentric dollmaker 
Dr. Coppelius; Swanhilda, a 
rambunctious young girl; and 
Franz, Swanhilda’s fiance. 
When Dr. Coppelius creates the 
beautiful doll Coppelia, he and 
Franz fall in love with the doll; 
Swanhilda’s heart breaks.
Coppelia had difficulty in at­
tracting European audiences 
throughout the 19th century. 
The ballet debuted at the Paris 
Opera in 1870 at a time whe4n 
the avante-garde was losing 
interest in ballet so perfor­
mances did not fare so well.
Also, the third act was lost 
during the Franco-Prussian 
War. Luckily, the libretto sur­
vived, and Marius Petipa was 
able to reconstruct Coppelia for 
the St. Petersburg performance 
in 1884.
During the October Revolu­
tion, Nicolas Sergeyev fled from 
Russia to the West taking with 
him notebooks of great classic 
ballets. Among these classics 
was Coppelia. As a result, the 
ballet was able to debut in the 
Metropolitan Opera House in 
1910. Since then, it has been 
performed time and time again 
all over the world.

Dancers’ Symposium kicks off new year
V'h'iBy KAYT SUKEL
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Dancers' Symposium is back, 
and it is better than ever. A 
relatively new club focusing on 
dance, the club is growing 
faster than junior English ma­
jors Lauren Daniluk and Jen­
nifer Hastings thoughtitwould 
when they founded it in 1990.
“After taking Daria Ward’s 
modem dance class when we 
were freshmen, Lauren and I 
felt that there weren’t enough 
dance class opportunities at 
CMU,” says Hastings. And so, 
starting from “absolute 
scratch,” Daniluk and Hastings 
started planning their first per­
formance in Spring 1990.
So far, the club’s primary fo­
cus has been on the show, but 
Daniluk and Hastings are look­
ing to expand. Dancers’ Sym­
posium also wants to eventu­
ally organize all sorts of dance, 
movies, lectures, and outside 
performances to give to the 
CMU community.
Another change in Dancers’ 
Symposium this semester deals 
with the long overdue division 
of labor.
“So far Lauren and I have 
done almost everything, so this 
term we are looking to get com­
mittees that are going to better 
organize. We want to have a 
presidential committee, a 
choreographer’s committee, ad­
vertising, special events, and a
financial committee to help the 
club grow,” explains Hastings.
Dancers’ Symposium does not 
discriminate. It needs lots of 
people—dancers andnon-danc- 
ers—to help keep it going. With 
members from CFA to CIT, 
Dancers’ Symposium is obvi­
ously looking for diversified 
members.
The club has grown tremen­
dously since 1990, evident from 
last semester’s performance. 
With almost a full house at ev­
ery performance, “Order Non 
Order” was well received by the 
CMU community. Hastings at­
tributes the success of last 
semester’s performance to the 
choreographers.
“We had many more technical 
problems last term than we ever 
did before, but the pieces were 
excellent. Most of the choreog­
raphers were experienced, so the 
pieces were very strong and pol­
ished.”
Some of the most memorable 
pieces performed last semester 
were “The Game,” a modem
dance piece by Lauren 
Daniluk which showed the 
straggle between beingin con­
trol and being controlled; 
“Masquerade,” by Becky 
Mingo, performed around a 
colorful bull mask; and “Oh 
Yeah,” an upbeat jazz num­
ber choreographed by Laura 
Harkcom.
Hastings believes this 
semester’s performance will 
be just as strong. “We have a 
lot ofdiversity. Wehave pieces 
ranging from romantic waltz­
ing to freestyle modern to 
character flamenco dancing.” 
This semester’s performance 
dates are set for April 24 at 8 
pm and April 25 at 2 pm and 
8 pm in the Women’s Gym.

By BRENDAN McFEELY
Assistant Diversions Editor
The AB Coffeehouse program 
returns this week with a little 
musical entertainment for the 
campus community. Tonight at 
8 pm in Skibo Ballroom, singer/ 
songwriter Tom Acousti will 
appear, performing his own 
unique brand of guitar-and-pi- 
ano-driven rock.
A popular performer on the 
Maine and New Hampshire solo 
acoustic circuit five years ago, 
Acousti is now on his comeback 
tour. He left the performance 
world to become operator of his 
own recording studio, Sound 
Harbor Studios in Westbrook, 
Massachusetts. He also briefly 
pursued an acting career, at­
tending open casting sessions 
for such diverse films as Jaws
II and The Blue Lagoon. En­
couraged by his performance in 
these casting calls, Acousti en­
rolled in the American Acad­
emy of Dramatic Arts in Los 
Angeles, where he remained for 
a year.
After becoming frustrated
with his peers in the Academy, 
Acousti returned to the East, 
where he was invited by friends 
to try out for a stage version of 
the film Fame. His success with 
this venture into the Off-Broad­
way world encouraged him to 
pursue stage acting. Acousti 
tried out successfully for the lead 
role in a musical entitled 
Starmites, but, due to his con­
tinuing solo singing career, was
unable to take the part.
Acousti’s singing career has 
continued, followingthe release 
of his first album, Process of 
Elimination, with the release 
of his second solo album, en­
titled Welcome to Reality. 
Acousti is coming to CMU as 
part of his first national college 
tour to promote his album.
Acousti’s performances have 
received rave reviews. “His in­
credible voice, musical talent, 
and sense of humor had stu­
dents pounding on tables, 
standing on chairs, and scream­
ing for more... Tom Acousti is a 
must see,” says Belinda S. Ray, 
President of the Union Board, 
University of Maine. “I’ve never 
had so many requests for a re­
turn engagement as I have had 
for Tom Acousti!” says John 
Walker, Activities Director of 
the University of Maine at
Farmington. “Captivating ... 
You’ve been warned about Tom 
Acousti,” says Bonnie C. Moore 
of Sweet Potato Magazine.
Acousti will be appearing to­
night, preceeded by opening acts 
Jeff Kunins and Mike Messers. 
Admission is free and refresh­
ments will be served.

River’s Edge
River’s Edge is a disturbing movie based upon a 
real 1980 murder case. If you feel the need to have 
your skin crawl on occasion, this movie will prob­
ably do it for you.
The movie is about a teenage boy who strangles a 
classmate, and leaves her naked body on the bank 
of a river. Soon thereafter, he begins to take his 
friends to see the corpse. A secret bond is formed 
between the kids who see the body, but eventually 
two of them report it. End of story.
Well, not quite. As Robert Bloch once said, “It’s 
not the destination, it’s the ride.” The ride through 
River’s Edge is terrifying at times, and the tension 
is always present. In addition, Dennis Hopper stars, 
and his performance is simply awesome. Love his 
inflatable doll, too!
This film is in the same genre as Psycho and 
Silence of the Lambs. If you like psychological thrill­
ers, you’ve got to see River’s Edge.

The Commitments
Ahhh, young musicians. They have such hopes 
and such dreams. They see the bright lights, the 
screaming fans, and the record deals. Never do they 
envision the struggle on their way to the “almost as 
good as Elvis” hall of fame.
The Commitments tells the story of Jimmy Rabbite 
who wants to bring a little soul to his hometown. He 
decides to start a band and advertises in a local 
publication. The people that show up for his audi­
tions are hilarious and the people he finally picks to 
join the band are talented as well as funny.
For a great story and a whole lotta soul, catch The 
Commitments down at DH 2210. It will not only 
keep your eyes glued to the screen, but will get your 
feet tapping as well.

My Girl
The logical expectation drawn from viewing the 
ads for My Girl is to see Macaulay Culkin starring 
in another funny film centered around children. If 
you have already seen the movie or if you know 
someone who has, you can decide for yourself whether 
or not you want to see it at DH 2210.
Advertised as a comedy, My Girl is anything but. 
The movie’s basic plot is the story of a young girl and 
her struggle to grow up without a mother and with 
a father who never seems to be there. Her experi­
ences, chronicled through one summer, are some­
times funny, but oft times tragic. The film tends to 
be cute, but not enough to make you gag. The 
characters are pretty believable (except I can’t tell 
whether the girl’s grandmother was real or stuffed). 
But on the whole, I’d say that My Girl is worth your 
buck.

Jagged Edge
This week’s installment of love and murder films 
stars Jeff Bridges and Glenn Close. The movie was 
shown in theaters in 1985 and catered to a different 
audience. Today, people want to see more in a 
psychological thriller.
Jagged Edge tells the tale of a wealthy publisher 
(Bridges) who is accused of killing his wife. He hires 
a lawyer (Close) who agrees to defend him because 
she is sure that he is an innocent man. Unsuprisingly, 
Close falls in love with him. The murder mystery 
unravels throughout the film as Close and Bridges 
exchange secret looks in the courtroom.
If anything, check out Jagged Edge for the raw 
talent of Bridges and Close rather than the actual 
Plot. If you’re looking for the thrill of a lifetime, don’t 
bother.

Final Analysis 
?
Final Analysis, starring Ri­
chard Gere, Kim Basinger, and 
Uma Thurman, opened Fri­
day at theaters in Pittsburgh. 
But don’t bother seeing it. 
Quite simply, it sucks.
The movie is about a psy­
chiatrist, Isaac Barr (Richard 
Gere), who is treating the pa­
tient, Diana (Uma Thurman). 
Diana tells Isaac that he 
should speak to her sister, 
Heather (Kim Basinger), who 
can shed some light on the 
family past. Heather shows 
up, and tells Isaac of her 
father’s abusive nature. She 
goes on to tell of her own hor­
rible marriage to a Greek Or­
thodox gangster. Of course, 
Isaac starts an affair with her.
Then he falls in love with 
her. Then she kills her hus­
band. Then the double crosses 
and triple crosses and qua­
druple crosses begin. This goes 
on, ad nauseum, until every­
one who needs to die is dead, 
and the movie is over.
Sound familiar? If you 
haven’t lived in a cave all of 
your life, you’ve seen this plot 
about a thousand times. Most 
of those times were better 
than this. I’ll give you a few 
specific reasons not to see the 
film.
There are big pauses in the 
middle of. characters’ sen­
tences, supposedly to build 
suspense; it doesn’t work.
The camera zooms in on 
characters’ faces for no par­
ticular reason.
The music sounds bad. More 
than that, it is ridiculously 
melodramatic.
Richard Gere is horrible. 
He shows no emotion, and is 
in no way believable as a psy­
chiatrist. His portrayal of the 
character, so important to the 
film, is pathetic.
The rest of the acting is hor­
rible, too. More specifically, it 
is flat.
The scenes are choppy, 
jumping from one to the next 
with alarming speed and little 
or no continuity.
The entire flick is one long, 
overused, tired and boring 
cliché.
If I obeyed the old saying, “If 
you don’t have anything nice 
to say this review couldn’t 
have been written. While we’re 
on the subject of old sayings: 
“A fool and his money are soon 
parted.” Better to give me the 
seven bucks, and I’ll try to 
stand on my head for you — 
you’ll enjoy it more than the 
movie.

Enya
Shepherd Moons 
'k'k'k'k
After a four-year wait, fans 
of Irish singer/songwriter Enya 
can at last rejoice. Enya has 
returned to the recording scene 
with her new Reprise Records 
release, Shepherd Moons. Fans 
of her past albums, Water­
mark, and the self-titled E/tya, 
should be more than pleased 
with Shepherd Moons.
Enya’s skill at composition 
and the sheer beauty of her 
voice continue to shine through. 
The ebb-and-flow of “Carib­
bean Blue,” the first single 
from the album, calls to mind 
the flowing beauty of the popu­
lar “Orinoco Flow,” from Wa­
termark. However, “Caribbean 
Blue” is so far above “Orinoco 
Flow” in quality, that it is no 
surprise to hear that superior 
quality reflected in the rest of
L Reprise Records 
Shepherd Moons.
Enya continues her tradition 
of mixing attractive pop melo­
dies with traditional Irish mu­
sic. This is especially effective 
in the tracks “Book of Days” 
(which combines Enya’s haunt- 
ingly beautiful voice with 
smooth percussion by Andy 
Duncan) and “Smaointe ...” 
(which again features Enya’s 
beautiful vocals, this time over 
the eerie hum of Liam 
0’Flionn‘s ulliean pipes).
Enya’s work continues to as­
tound and impress this re­
viewer, a fan since I first heard 
“Orinoco Flow” four years ago. 
I recommend this album unre­
servedly. The sheer power of 
Enya to both entertain and re­
lax her listeners cannot be 
downplayed. The beauty and 
the emotion of her voice are not 
only enthralling, but romantic, 
certainly a plus in this season. 
Pick up Shepherd Moons as soon 
as you can—it might just come 
in handy on Valentine’s Day ... 
or is that night?

The Pixies
Trompe Le Monde 
-k"ku2
The Pixies, along with other 
underdog European imports 
like the Sugar Cubes, define a 
category of band that seems to 
be gaining popularity in the US. 
Their music is best described 
as well-tempered dissonance, 
with granules of rock ‘n’ roll 
sticking up here and there in 
melodically interesting ways. 
The music is invariably scarred 
by horrid, grating vocals, but
sometimes manages to keep 
itself afloat by virtue of intrigu­
ing rather than actively enter­
taining the listener.
The Pixies’ recent Trompe Le 
Monde is probably one of the 
more palatable specimens of 
this genre. While all the typi­
cal unfortunate trappings are 
there — annoying nasal vo­
cals, aimless melodic incoher­
ence, incomprehensible lyrics 
written entirely in lower case
— many of the songs have 
enough unexpected twists to 
keep you interested for a while.
The album is an eclectic melt­
ing pot of different genres. 
Some cater to the current fas­
cination with upbeat malevo­
lence, while others are more 
frenzied, bordering on heavy 
metal. Still others almost sound 
like sit com themes, albeit 
somewhat deranged ones.
Though a curious mix of 
styles, Trompe Le Monde is oth- 
erwise unmoving and
©1991 4AD/Elektra
unremarkable. There’s noth­
ing on this album that’s going 
to be around in ten years, or 
possibly even ten months, but 
if you have a taste for a some­
what offbeat and alien twist to 
traditional rock, this might be 
your cup of motor oil.

ByE. L. CHAMBERS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
“Heaven is under our feet as 
well as over our heads.”
— Walden
Henry David Thoreau
In the summer of 1845 when 
Henry David Thoreau moved to 
Walden Pond, the woods that 
surrounded it were fairly undis­
turbed. It remained undisturbed 
for other writers such as Louisa 
May Alcott and Ralph Waldo 
Emerson, who were also in­
spired by the area.
But over the last century, 
Walden Woods has become the 
victim of careless tourists, high­
way projects and political ne­
glect. Although the pond itself 
is the focus of preservation ef­
forts, the surrounding woods 
deserve equal protection.
In April 1990, Don Henley, 
former drummer and vocalist 
for the Eagles, founded the 
Walden Woods Project, a non­
profit organization that is try­
ing to acquire and preserve the 
Walden area which lies in the 
towns of Concord and Lincoln, 
Massachusetts.
In an effort to raise the fund­
ing required to save the area, 
Don Henley worked with the 
publishing company, Long- 
meadow Press, to create a col­
lection of essays which reflect 
upon Walden Pond and the need 
for a conscious effort to take 
better care of the land we live 
on.
The collection, Heaven is Un­
der Our Feet, consists of over 
sixty essays written by celebri­
ties, conservationists and other 
concerned citizens. The proceeds 
from the sale of the book go 
directly into the Walden Woods 
Project.
The essays range from

FEET. A collection of works by 
writers, singers, officials and other 
renowned people concerned about 
Walden Woods and the en­
vironment in general. Longmeadow 
Press.
thought-provoking to tear jerk­
ing. Although many of the es­
says were intended to make 
you stop and think about what 
is happening to places like 
Walden, many essays, such as 
“Baby, You Can Drive My 
Hovercraft” by actor/comedian 
Tom Hanks, provide a light­
hearted look at the way we live. 
His recollection of the Weekly 
Reader magazine he read in 
grade school and the picture 
presented of the future is full of 
his own comic thoughts and 
opinions. This balances essays 
such as “A Balance Between 
Our Need and Our Greed”, by 
Arun Gandhi, and “Back to the 
Grassroots“, by Jim Hightower, 
which look at our efforts to save 
the planet in a clear and brutal 
light.
Reading Arun Gandhi’s ac­
count of the way his grandfa­
ther, Mohandas K. Gandhi, 
taught his family to live, made 
me wonder why I need all of 
this plastic and will probably 
make it impossible for me to 
throw out another wooden pen­
cil.
Although the immediate in­
tent of Heaven is Under Our 
Feet is to generate funding for 
the project, it has a long-term 
purpose. In her essay, “From 
The Big Chill to the Big Pic­
ture,” film actress Mary Kay 
Place reflects upon her experi­
ences while filming The Big 
Chill and thoughts about where
the world is heading. This es­
say presents new ideas and per­
spectives which cannot be ne­
glected.
Many of the essays are in 
and pf themselves surprising. I 
never thought Bette Midler, 
Jimmy Buffet, and Arlo 
Guthrie would ever be on my 
list of good writers.
Unfortunately, celebrities 
such as Tom Cruise and Paula 
Abdul, who wrote for the book, 
will probably never reach that 
list. Although Tom Cruise’s “I 
Can’t See the Forest if There 
Are No Trees” didn’t keep my
Him
©1990 Longmeadow Press
attention for more than a few 
minutes, his intentions should 
be admired.
Cruise’s interpretation of the 
Amazon rain forest is bleak 
compared to the image created 
in “Progress, The GNP and The 
Naming of Things” by Sting, a 
short piece with a direct mes­
sage. I expected Jack Nichol­
son’s essay to be witty and sar­
castic; instead I got an essay 
about “Solar Electricity” which 
offers no thought, just straight, 
researched information. But 
the information is good and I 
learned a few things.
Fortunately, the sarcasm I 
missed is more than prevalent
in Carrie Fisher’s essay “Read­
ing By Lamplight,” a short spin­
off from her novel “Postcards 
From the Edge” which recap­
tures the character Alex Daniels. 
Through his eyes, Fisher looks 
at how we, as selfish people, 
neglect the environment.
On Thursday, February 6, Don 
Henley made an appearance at 
Borders Books in the South Hills. 
While many people were there 
just to see him, many others 
were there because of their con­
cern for areas such as Walden.
In his essay, he reflects his 
own childhood in Linden, Texas 
and his thoughts on Henry David 
Thoreau and thanks the people 
who contributed their time and 
effort to the project. He writes, 
“InLife Without Principle (1863), 
Thoreau writes, “Men will lie on 
their backs, talking about the 
fall of man, and never make an 
effort to get up.’ The people who 
contributed to this book have at 
least gotten to their knees.” 
Henley’s devotion to the project 
makes-i/eaue/i is Under Our Feet 
a worthwhile collection of.
Heaven is Under Our Feet pro­
vides readers with the works of 
respected authors such as, 
James A. Michener, Kurt 
V onnegut and the outlook of oth­
ers such as Garry Trudeau and 
Pat Riley. The book is an eclectic 
myriad of different people who 
share a common goal.
Many of the essays are truly 
wonderful. While others should 
have been more polished, they 
make up a collection of writings 
that deserve more than a conve­
nient place on the coffee tables 
of the upwardly-mobile people 
living in the suburbs of America.
Perhaps if we face up to the 
environmental issues shown in 
these essays and try to rectify 
those problems, we will be able 
to see that “heaven is under our 
feet.”

For a Special DG on Valentine’s Day: 
My love for a brown-haired woman is 
strong.
Although she has loved another long,
I am still devout and loving to her.
And wishing I could be heard.
To tell the brown-haired girl is a chore.
I will always love you now and evermore, 
Until the day our path breaks 
My love for you I will make.
Padushka,
Lover, make me a capuccino
Froth up my life
And maybe one warm night
we can make love in the Kumaon forests
— Mati
Danielle,
I’m crazy about you
It would be a shame not to see you again.
— Russ
Rainer,
Monkey butt, monkey butt, you have a 
monkey butt.
— E-4 chick
p.s. you have an apple core behind your 
couch.

My love, what is this person doing to you? 
If this BOY doesn’t have the nuts to 
reveal himself to you, he’s no better than 
the dog shit on the bottom of my shoes. If 
you would like, I could hunt him down 
and maim him for you.

Rachanee,
It’s stinky.

To KOLA-BARABOLA 
Perhaps love is like resting place 
A shelter from the storm 
It is there to give you comfort 
It is there to give you warmth 
And in those days of trouble 
Full of struggle, full of pain 
The memory of love will give you strength 
love always,
MIRIK

The blue ribbon.
Definitely the blue ribbon.
(Although green would be acceptable!) 
That would be a great Valentine’s Day 
surprise.
But can you have it delivered?
I’ll work on it. Could it be a day or two 
early?
Alina:
Through 4 am wakeups,
Kings Corner, 
piles and
dropping soap, it’s all really simple: 
You are the best best friend I could ever 
ever hope for.
See you at 4 am again?

You’re my first Valentine.
