Fine Dining Connoisseur
Although I take pride in a 
lot of things about Carnegie 
Mellon, its immediate area 
suffers from a lack of avail-
able restaurants, Craig Street 
notwithstanding. When I 
want some tasty, totally un-
healthy food ?t for a college 
student’s tastes and budget, 
I have to head for the places 
surrounding the University of 
Pittsburgh. There, the scene 
resembles a traditional college 
town: A whole bunch of places 
screaming for the patronage 
of young adults grabbing a 
bite to eat.
On one such occasion, I 
found myself walking towar 
dvenerable establishments 
like Primanti Brothers, Qdoba, 
and Panera Bread, but noticed 
a restaurant hidden in the 
midst of everything with the 
strange name of McDonald’s. 
Curiosity got the better of me, 
and I found myself navigat-
ing through the doors, ?nding 
an interior full of booths and 
tables. 
Evidently, the place did 
not have full service, as there 
was a very long line of people 
looking to order food. Though 
I worried that I might not be 
able to grab anything and get 
back to campus on time for 
my next class, I found that 
the line moved fairly quickly. 
Though the line had stretched 
to the last doors when I came 
through, I still managed to 
make it to the front of the line 
in a little under three and a 
half minutes. I also noticed 
that people did not seem to 
wait long before receiving 
their orders in bags and de-
parting the establishment, 
perhaps with urgent business 
to take care of.
As I waited for the last few 
people ahead of me to order, I 
gazed at the menu, and I was 
astonished by how low the 
prices were. A double cheese-
burger, dubbed the “Big Mac” 
with three whole buns, was 
priced at under $4.50. I looked 
further and found a surpris-
ingly large offering of “Pre-
mium Chicken Salads,” each 
offering a healthy amount of 
greens, grilled or fried chick-
en, and various add-ons like 
bacon, for as low as $4.59. 
Another menu feature that 
caught my attention was their 
“All Day Breakfast Menu.” 
Various intriguing options, 
like the enchanting “Egg Mc-
Muf?n,” sounded like tempta-
tions for a future visit. My eyes 
turned back toward the lunch 
items, and I saw a deal that I 
couldn’t believe I had over-
looked: the McPick 2 for $5. 
The Big Mac was on it, and my 
mind already liked the idea 
of getting two double cheese-
burgers for only $5. Of course, 
my more rational side thought 
having so many patties might 
get tiring, so I considered the 
other possibilities the deal of-
fered. I was surprised to see 
that this place would offer 
seafood in the form of a “Filet-
o-Fish,” but I did not hear the 
call of the sea. Instead, my at-
tention turned to a offering of 
ten “Chicken McNuggets.” The 
combination of two of my fa-
vorite meats appealed greatly 
to me, and I had my order 
ready for the smiling woman 
behind the counter.
After ordering the two to-
gether along with a large iced 
tea, I inquired about a student 
discount, obviously not ex-
pecting a place already offer-
ing such low prices to further 
slash the costs. To my aston-
ishment, the woman gave me 
the af?rmative, and knocked 
an entire 10 percent off my 
order. The food was prepared 
with a speed that could only 
be described as “fast,” and it 
wasn’t long before I took a 
seat in one of their luxurious 
booths. 
I ?rst examined the sand-
wich, which looked even bet-
ter than the menu picture. 
Unsure of how I could handle 
such a formidable burger, I 
ventured with as large a bite as 
I could and discovered a won-
derful symphony of ?avors. A 
sesame seed bun, well-sized 
patties, pickles that imparted 
a nice crunch, and a sauce that 
brought an unexpected but 
oh-so-right tanginess made 
the Big Mac a wonderful cu-
linary concoction. After a few 
bites, I decided to take a look 
at the nuggets, and I found 
a sizable amount of golden 
goodness. Each bite imparted 
a perfect blend of crunchy 
breading and delicious white 
meat. After downing a few of 
them, I got the strangest idea 
of adding some of them to my 
burger. This was truly a stroke 
of genius, as beef and McChi-
cken joined together into one 
delicious medley of McMeat.
With plenty of iced tea to 
take back with me, my experi-
ence has been excellent from 
start to ?nish. I will certainly 
return to McDonald’s. The 
value here is incredible, the 
service is excellent, and the 
location is wonderfully con-
venient. I will de?nitely be re-
turning in the near future.

Not girls, not yet chicken 
and waf?e connoisseurs
In light of recent tuition 
increases, students are ?nd-
ing it harder and harder to 
pay for tuition. Families are 
cutting back and younger 
siblings are being forced 
to ?nd cheaper options for 
school because their older 
siblings spent all of their 
parent’s money on Carnegie 
Mellon. But now younger 
siblings can reignite those 
dreams of an Ivy League ed-
ucation, because the ?nan-
cial aid of?ce has created 
a new program that allows 
students to pay for their 
education with their souls.
The program, very cre-
atively named WeBuySouls, 
is an option recently made 
available to all students. In 
the past, the application for 
selling your soul to Carn-
egie Mellon was lengthy 
and many a student opted 
for the more traditional ?-
nancial aid route. However, 
WeBuySouls has stream-
lined their application 
process, making the trans-
action more ef?cient and 
affordable for all interested 
applicants.
We at The Tartan had 
the opportunity to sit down 
with the program’s found-
ers to talk about their inspi-
ration for the program, and 
their plans for the program 
going further. Though ex-
cited with the progress al-
ready made, WeBuySouls 
has plans to expand the pro-
gram to accommodate stu-
dents who aren’t interested 
in giving up their souls. “We 
don’t want to discriminate 
against anyone,” said stu-
dent Anisha Padwekar, the 
genius behind it all. “We 
hope that in the near future 
we can expand WeBuySouls 
to include options such as 
limb payment.”
A great feature to the 
program is that WeBuy-
Souls does not lock students 
into yearly contracts. With 
the Soul-Buy-Back feature, 
any student who chooses to 
opt out of their settlement 
with WeBuySouls can buy 
back their soul at a low cost. 
WeBuySouls does not guar-
antee, however, that your 
soul will be returned in it’s 
original condition.
Some schools in the area 
have already received We-
BuySouls’ latest payment 
plan, which now accepts 
blood, sweat, and tears as 
viable currency. We are 
told that Carnegie Mellon 
is on the list of schools to 
receive the program expan-
sion soon. Students can ex-
pect to see the additional 
“Blood, Sweat, and Tears” 
?nancial aid option this 
coming fall.
Student caught choking the chicken in Gates bathroom
JOEY PEISER
Never too old for this
Sophomore computer sci-
ence major and all-around 
nice guy Paul Reubens was 
caught slapping the salami in 
a third-?oor bathroom in the 
Gates Center last week. 
Carnegie Mellon Police 
discovered Reubens, whose 
kielbasa-cuddling habits in 
Hamerschlag dorm are still 
legendary, smack dab in the 
middle of roughing up the sus-
pect in question. 
A disgusted professor sum-
moned law enforcement after 
overhearing the unmistakable 
sound of squishing the squidg-
ie in the bathroom from inside 
his of?ce.
 “It’s appalling; these stu-
dents thinking they can go to 
the palm prom whenever and 
wherever they please. Carn-
egie Mellon students need to 
learn that if they want to shuf-
?e their iPod in public, they 
must rise up the professional 
ladder and get their own of?ce 
like I do. Then they can argue 
with Handy Longfellow until 
the cows come home,” the pro-
fessor in question remarked.
When asked why he felt the 
urge to polish his Oscar in the 
Gates bathroom rather than 
the privacy of his own room, 
Reubens confessed that the 
thrill of diddling his skittles 
in a public place had made it a 
compulsion. “I can’t shake this  
uncontrollable need to play 
one-handed baseball in in-
appropriate forums, such as 
Greyhound bus bathrooms 
and the big and tall section 
of a J.C. Penney department 
store. I’m entering counseling 
for my af?iction, and hopeful-
ly I’ll overcome the urges that 
tell me to slam the clam where 
people might see,” Reubens 
announced in an emotional 
video statement to the Carn-
egie Mellon community. 
Many students have react-
ed to Reuben’s video.Students 
have been joining in solidar-
ity with Reubens, as many 
students have been taking to 
campus bathroom stall walls 
to confess that they, indeed, 
have tickled the taco in that 
place before.

SYDNEY ROSLIN
High School Musical Expert
Reeling from the recent 
successes of the movies its 
Marvel Cinematic Universe, 
including box of?ce hits such 
as Ant-Man, Guardians of the 
Galaxy, and Captain America: 
The Winter Soldier, Disney ex-
ecutives have announced their 
next big project — a slate of 
?lms exploring the universe of 
the hit Disney Channel Origi-
nal Movie, High School Musical.
“We have realized that 
the kids who originally fell in 
love with High School Musical 
are not kids anymore, so as 
those kids grow up, we’d like 
to grow the franchise with 
them,” said a Disney spokes-
person. “The High School Mu-
sical Universe, or the ‘High 
School MUniverse’ as we call it 
here at Disney, aims to expand 
a movie world that previously 
just encompassed life at a high 
school, and really give audi-
ences a look at the real-world 
experiences that these charac-
ters go through.”
Phase One of the High 
School MUniverse begins with 
What Do I Do After School Mu-
sical, to be released in May 
2017. Just in time for gradua-
tion season, this movie follows 
the beloved HSM cast through 
their ?nal months of college, 
as they encounter frequent 
panic attacks and realize they 
do not have a plan for their life 
after graduation.
 In December 2017, Dis-
ney will release Living in My 
Parents’ House but it’s Okay 
Because I Am Only a Few 
Months Out of School Musical, 
a charming holiday tale that 
has family tensions running 
high as the singing, status-
quo-breaking college gradu-
ates struggle to ?nd jobs while 
still being supported by their 
parents. 
Valentine’s Day 2018 will 
bring It Was So Much Easier 
Finding Other Single People 
Back in School Musical, a date-
night movie that follows the 
confused, musically inclined 
adults through the stresses of 
online dating and going on 
coffee dates with “that nice 
young man from Grandma’s 
congregation.” 
Finally, the last movie in 
Phase One will be All My Face-
book Friends are More Suc-
cessful than Me, I Should Have 
Gone to Grad School Musical, 
slated for release in theaters 
on Thanksgiving Day, 2018.
While movie titles have 
only been released for the 
Phase One movies, rumors 
have been con?rmed that 
there will be a Phase Two, 
Three, Four, and, depending 
on the life spans of the actors, 
a Phase Five. 
“We want to truly follow 
these characters throughout 
their entire lives,” a Disney 
representative stated in a re-
cent interview. “These movies 
will cover everything. Buying 
an apartment, getting a ‘real 
job,’ picking out a cat, get-
ting married, having a kid or 
two, getting divorced, hitting 
a mid-life crisis, trying and 
failing to write the next Great 
American Novel, running a 
carpool, getting ?red from 
work, trying to ?nd purpose 
in life, handling the kids as 
they go through that rebel-
lious stage and decide that 
they don’t want to sing at all 
during any point in their high 
school years, we want to bring 
it all to the big screen. Time 
permitting, we even want to 
do a series of movies in nurs-
ing homes. This will quite lit-
erally be a franchise that lasts 
a lifetime.”
Another circulating rumor 
regarding the High School 
MUniverse is the potential for 
stand-alone spinoff ?lms that 
will still remain in the HSMU 
canon. Conversations have 
mentioned a movie entitled 
Janitor of the High School Mu-
sical, which will focus on the 
life of the janitor who appar-
ently “saw the whole thing go 
down” in regards to the origi-
nal High School Musical. There 
is also discussion of the title 
Unions in the School Musical, a 
behind-the-scenes look at the 
strength of the teachers’ union 
in East High.
Regardless of these ru-
mors, it is clear that Disney 
has a series of blockbusters on 
their hands. Fans are excited 
to see the progression of the 
MUniverse over the years. Be-
tween the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe, the Star Wars Saga, 
and the High School MUni-
verse, Disney will certainly 
have audiences ?ocking to 
movie theaters for years to 
come.

Underage Drinking
April 14-16, 2016
University Police and CMU

large portion of students aged  
18-20. Among those whose 
citations were considered  
“inevitable” are the Hamer-

classes, and that really quiet 
girl who sits behind you in  
15-112. 
When asked if this pre-

Knows the truth
Overheard @ CMU has 
now overtaken the Tartan as 
Carnegie Mellon’s number 
one source for general cam-
pus news. A poll circulated 
by Student Government to 
guide budget allocation for 
campus media revealed that 
90 percent of respondents 
wrote-in “Overheard @ 
CMU” as their “most trusted 
source for important infor-
mation related to Carnegie 
Mellon,” with only 5 per-
cent ranking the Tartan as 
their number one. 2 percent 
of students ranked ReadMe 
as their number one, and 
The Cut ranked number one 
among WRCT members and 
?rst-years with vinyl record 
players in their room. Many 
other students have cited 
waking up and checking 
Twitter as their source.
The results, however are 
not expected to negatively 
affect The Tartan’s budget 
allocation too dramatically, 
for its status as a media or-
ganization makes it privy 
to the global control con-
spiracy that gives the pow-
ers that be a vice-like grip 
on the minds of the masses.
“While we are fully 
aware that humanity and 
its increasing interconnect-
edness is opening the pos-
sibility of alternative news 
sources based in interper-
sonal communication, we 
currently foresee at least 
one additional generation 
of media control. The Tar-
tan will still receive the nec-
essary budget to continue 
pirsuing its mind control 
tactics for the time being,” 
assured The Tartan’s faculty 
adviser. 
Take your soma; every-
thing will be alright.

Tartan endorses No Con?dence for SBP
TARTAN BOARD
Swaying all of your opinions
Re?ecting on the Stu-
dent Government debates 
this past week, The Tartan 
would like to announce its 
of?cial endorsement of No 
Con?dence in the races for 
Student Body President, 
Vice President for Organi-
zations, and Vice President 
for Finance.
On Thursday night, stu-
dents gathered in McCo-
nomy Auditorium to ask 
candidates tough questions 
and demand thoughtful 
answers. Throughout the 
contest the candidates en-
gaged in lively discussion 
and gave fairly convincing 
answers, but they simply 
could not and will never 
compete with the silent 
reassurance that No Con?-
dence embodies. 
Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents have been, are, and 
will forever continue to be 
the best, and they deserve 
the best. And much as the 
candidates in this year’s 
contest have tried, they 
have not proven them-
selves as more than ca-
pable to lead this student 
body. No Con?dence has 
the particular advantage of 
not being any of the other 
candidates.
These are positions that 
affect every student on a 
daily basis, therefore every 
student has a tremendous 
stake in the outcome of this 
election. We cannot place 
the future of this campus 
in unquali?ed hands. If 
you’re a student who wants 
to see meaningful change 
at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity in the coming term, 
The Tartan urges you to 
cast your vote for No Con-
?dence for every position. 
It is the only way to ensure 
the best candidate wins.

God particle discovered, unimpressed
JOSHUA “IN PRINT” BROWN
Former Spice Girl, Ginger
There has been a lot of 
hype in the recent years re-
garding the idea that we are 
all made in God’s image. Lam-
inin, an integral component 
in the structural framework 
of nearly every tissue in the 
body, is a protein which is 
shaped rather interestingly 
like a cross. Researchers who 
discovered laminin cited pri-
mary research literature, such 
as the hypothesis presented in 
Colossians et al., 1:17, which 
purports that “[God] is be-
fore all things, and in Him 
all things are held together.” 
They made the case that since 
laminin holds us together, it’s 
composed of particles, and 
since we’re made in God’s  
image, then the particles that 
make up laminin must be God 
particles.
In order to prove their 
?ndings, researchers synthe-
sized a whole bunch of lam-
inin molecules and ran them 
through an incinerator. This 
caused a chemical breakdown 
within the protein, as its dy-
namic folding patterns began 
to denature, and eventually, 
the particles bounced freely 
from the cross-like structure. 
The researchers then caught 
the particles with microscop-
ic butter?y nets and herded 
the bouncy little fellows into 
a glass slide. After slipping 
them under the microscope, a 
curious thing happened. The 
?rst researcher who tried to 
look through the microscope 
died on the spot. 
“It all happened so fast,” 
said Alexander Flemming, a 
research professor in Carn-
egie Mellon’s Department of 
Theological Physics and the 
project’s lead researcher. “In 
his haste, he forgot one of 
the most fundamental tenets 
of our discipline, Exodus et 
al., 33:20, that ‘no man may 
see God and live!’ But it was 
time, I suppose. The Particle 
has a plan, and who are we to  
question it?”
Rather than trying to view 
it through a microscope, the 
researchers quickly donned 
protective welding masks and 
placed high-frequency micro-
phones next to the petri dish 
to try and determine whether 
the particle were sentient or 
not. When the researchers 
played back the audio from 
the mysterious particle, the 
recording was a bit jarring.
“Seriously? It took you this 
long? This is just embarrass-
ing. Come on, guys, you’re ru-
ining my image.”
In an interview with The 
Tartan, the God Particle had 
this to say:
“Bruh, SMH, don’t get bit-
ter, just get better.” The Tartan 
refused to offer a response, 
but the con?ict was resolved 
after a savage dance battle.

An exclusive tour of the new singularity bunker in  basement of Warner Hall
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Rodent Commander-in-Chief
This past week The Tartan 
got the exclusive opportunity 
to travel through the founda-
tion of Warner Hall to tour the 
brand new H. Guyford Stever 
Singularity Bunker.
University of?cials, in-
creasingly unnerved with 
each passing day at the seem-
ingly endless potential of the 
technology we house, an-
nounced that this new con-
struction is Carnegie Mellon’s 
approach to security in the 
21st century. “Arti?cial intel-
ligence technology is growing 
faster than the rate that we 
can conceive of its growth. It’s 
only a matter of time before 
we welcome our robot over-
lords, and you can bet your 
bottom we will all be cower-
ing underground,” reported 
an anonymous source.
According to Wikipedia, 
the technological singular-
ity will occur when machines 
that we create become capa-
ble of exponentially recursive 
self-improvement until they 
achieve a level of intelligence 
that surpasses human under-
standing. According to Wiki-
pedia, futurist Ray Kurzweil 
predicts that this will happen 
around 2045, but science-?c-
tion author and computer sci-
entist Vernor Vinge only gives 
us until 2030. But really, who 
can know for sure?
The bunker has just one 
entrance and no exit. A hid-
den elevator in Warner Hall 
takes riders seven stories un-
derground to a structure that 
spans another ?ve stories 
down. But once the Univer-
sity President opens the bun-
ker, of?cials have a mere two 
hours to make it underground 
before the elevator shuts off 
permanently, never to be used 
again.
Thanks to sponsorship 
from Google, Duolingo, Drop-
box, and the Department of 
Defense, the bunker is out?t-
ted with all imaginable com-
forts and safety precautions. 
Cisco also sponsored each 
bunker resident for one call to 
say goodbye to a loved one.
Of?cials are suf?ciently 
secure that they will survive 
at least a year or so before 
the overlords come to enslave 
them. They may be our supe-
riors at the university, but we 
are all equal in death.
SCITECH BRIEFS
Briefs (For Support)
Brief-style underwear 
was invented in 1930 by 
President Calvin Coolidge’s 
lady-friend, Bernice An-
ders. Inspired by the presi-
dent’s own brief manner 
of speaking, the undergar-
ments provide both the 
modesty and support that 
the everyday man craves. 
The ?rst briefs ever donned 
were constructed out of 
leaves and used to shelter 
Adam’s naughty bits from 
God’s all-seeing eyes, back 
in 2012. Since then, the 
style has become a fan-fa-
vorite of men who want to 
feel supported and safe. A 
pair of briefs were elected 
mayor of a small Kentucky 
town in 1998, when a citi-
zen made the case that no-
body would support him 
and his family as much as 
Calvin Klein.
Boxers (For Freedom)
These products, often 
made of cotton, provide 
the maximum range of ?ex-
ibility and the minimum of 
compression. However they 
lack in the support and the 
consolidation provided by 
boxer briefs. By utilizing 
only natural ?bers, many 
of these veer the asymp-
tote of limited smoothness, 
prohibiting thread counts 
above 1,000 for fear of in-
stant death. These classic 
designs provide the most 
freedom but risk bunch-
ing and displacement. 
While seemingly the most 
straightforward of the de-
signs, the humble boxer has 
the highest statistical vari-
ance and shallowest curve 
of any of the designs being 
surveyed. Though the risks 
for an awful pair are low, 
the risks for mediocrity are 
great.
Boxer-Briefs (For 
Supportive Freedom)
The combination of 
spandex and cotton or ny-
lon provides these beau-
ties with the perfect blend 
between structure and 
support. Speci?cally engi-
neered to cooperate at the 
maximum dongle angle of 
23 degrees from the hori-
zontal in order to prevent 
spillage and maintain ?ex-
ibility by means of the elas-
ticity of the material allow-
ing for stretch and give. The 
maximum tensile strength 
ensures that the fabric will 
not in fact collapse under 
the weight of any package 
it is given due to the 5 – 10 
percent spandex added to 
the natural or synthetic ?-
bers. The result is a comfort-
able, yet structurally sound  
garment that can hold even 
the heaviest of cargo.
Thongs (For Fun) 
Thong underwear ?rst 
scampered onto the scene 
in 1654, when a feral child 
was discovered in the 
woods of Berlin, NH. He 
was malnourished and de-
hydrated, and he had no 
developed language skills, 
but what he did have was 
an acutely developed eye 
for fashion. The young lad, 
approximately seven years 
old, had crafted for him-
self a loin covering consist-
ing solely of dental ?oss. 
The researchers to whom 
he was brought gave him a 
routine medical examina-
tion and then focused their 
attention to the real issue 
at hand: how to reverse-
engineer and mass-manu-
facture his undergarments. 
Through this experimenta-
tion, the thong was born.
Jockstraps (For Nuts) 
The distinctive jock-
strap style was invented by 
former bodybuilder and 
California governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in 1883 
while he was practicing his 
?exing routine for election 
season. Schwarzenegger’s 
?exed glutes proved too 
powerful for the measly 
fabric of his Fruit of the 
Looms, and while the fabric 
was obliterated, the elastic 
bands held strong. Thus 
was born the breathable, 
assthetically ambiguous, 
and fetishized article of 
athletic support which we 
all know and secretly love. 
Jockstraps are the number 
one import for Florida and 
California, and the number 
two export of Utah, after 
certain other types of un-
dergarments.
Longjohns (For 
Toasted Nuts) 
These synthetic ?ber based 
warming garments are intend-
ed to keep your legs toasty in 
the winter. However, there is 
a more sinister underbelly to 
these cherished brief deriva-
tives. Since these are most of-
ten made of synthetic materi-
als in order to best trap the 
heat, it is important to ensure 
that you don’t get too toasty, 
for if you catch on ?re and 
the longjohns will in fact melt 
(unlike natural ?bers) form-
ing a ?tted and scalding cast 
for your legs to sear beyond re-
pair. While these long under-
pants are designed to promote 
maximum warmth through 
use of polyester that traps the 
heat in by restricting air-?ow, 
this same design could seal 
your legs in a ?ery tomb of 
melted plastic and regret.

How things work: personal growth and development
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Quarter-life Ongoing crisis 
expert
The ?rst step to personal 
growth is to stare into the 
abyss. Locate your own spe-
cial abyss and ask it how 
things have come to be the 
way they are. The abyss will 
probably tell you it’s your 
fault, you idiot. But do not 
listen to the abyss when it’s 
in such a bad mood. Soon, it 
will brighten up once again 
and envelop you in its velvety 
blackness, where you can get 
lost only to ?nd yourself again 
— a newer, shinier, fresher 
version of wonderful you.
Now that you are in the 
abyss, think about everything 
you have ever done wrong. 
You have to think about all 
of your stupidest mistakes 
at the same time, otherwise 
the abyss will be displeased. 
You do not want a displeased 
abyss on your hands, trust 
The Tartan. It will eat you.
If you feel your body slow-
ly ?lling with lead, and your 
mind bursting through your 
forehead, that’s good. That 
means the process is working. 
No one told you this would be 
fun, did they? The Tartan is 
sorry to tell you that self-im-
provement, much like beauty, 
is pain. But if you just make it 
through the next few steps, 
you could have a trophy for 
most beautiful person ever, 
inside and out. The abyss will 
not give you this trophy, nor 
will The Tartan, but you could 
always make one yourself. 
That’d be kind of sad though.
Wait, are you crying? Are 
you actually crying right 
now? There’s no crying in the 
abyss, and it says as much on 
the entry sign, so you’d bet-
ter quit the waterworks or 
— well, now you’ve done it. 
You’ve awakened the abyss. 
Poor thing; it’d been having 
such a nice nap.
How about you put aside 
all of that introspection for 
now and try to negotiate with 
the abyss? Why don’t you ?ex 
those con?ict-resolving mus-
cles? No, The Tartan doesn’t 
speak abyss; we thought you 
did. You were the one waltz-
ing in out of nowhere, whin-
ing about personal growth. 
You’d better run, honestly. 
Run from your problems! 
Run!
The Tartan would like to 
disclaim any responsibility 
for the horrors experienced in 
the abyss. Please stop crying.

Tales from abroad: Journey to the center of scaife
INDIA PRICE
Chicken and Waf?es  
Connoisseur
Like many students at 
Carnegie Mellon, I often ?nd 
myself stressed out to the 
point where I’m one wrong 
look away from calling it 
quits. On top of six classes, 
I’m pursuing an active career 
in having the best eyebrows 
on the face of this good earth. 
So it gets a little hectic. In the 
spirit of Parks and Recre-
ation’s great Donna Meagle, 
I decided to treat myself.
I knew I wanted to go on a 
vacation, and as a college stu-
dent whose ?nances ?uctuate 
between having pretty much 
no money and having liter-
ally no money, the main cri-
teria for my destination came 
down to cost. I crunched the 
numbers, took out all of the 
money I had in my name, 
and ?nally cashed in the jar 
of change on my desk. My 
budget reached a grand to-
tal of $7.29. Astounding. “I’ll 
just have to go somewhere 
cheap,” I thought to myself. 
I decided backpacking was a 
cheaper alternative to stay-
ing at some lavish hotel. I 
also ?gured that my Insta-
gram photos and Snapchat 
stories would be way cooler 
if I went backpacking, and 
what are vacations for if not 
the social media approval of 
people we don’t even talk to?
After mulling it over I ?-
nally decided on a destina-
tion: the elusive and enig-
matic Alan M. Scaife Hall 
of Engineering! Scaife Hall 
is located about 200 miles 
from my current residence in 
Morewood Gardens. I was de-
termined to walk to my des-
tination. It would take three 
days walking nonstop, so I es-
timated it would take me just 
under a week if I took breaks 
and stopped to rehydrate.
Everyone knows that the 
journey of a thousand miles 
begins with a single step, 
but in my case it began with 
a treacherous walk across 
Forbes Avenue where I only 
narrowly avoided being hit 
by a car. despite the fact 
that Forbes had been closed 
to through traf?c. I felt like 
I was in the Reese Wither-
spoon movie Wild, trying 
to walk myself back to the 
woman I once was. My trip 
was met with some other 
hardships. The elevators in 
Wean Hall nearly took my 
arm off, and I was attacked 
in a very boa-constrictor-
wrapping-around-me-and-
squeezing-the-life-from-me 
sort of way as I passed the 
queue at La Prima. I ended 
up making it out alive, but 
I was a little shaken up.
As I neared my destina-
tion, off to my right in the 
distance I could see a large 
tower-like building shooting 
up into the clouds. I stopped, 
stared in awe, pointed excit-
edly, and asked someone if 
that was Scaife Hall. They 
managed to respond in the 
midst of a ?t of laughter, 
“That’s the Cathedral of 
Learning.” I was a little bit 
disappointed, and asked my-
self if perhaps I should’ve 
gone there instead. But I  
regained my high spir-
its and continued on. 
Eventually, as I de-
scended down a rather large 
mountain, the entrance 
of Scaife Hall came into 
view. Finally! After days 
of walking, I had arrived.
I looked around, expect-
ing to ?nd a building simi-
lar to the rest I had seen on 
my walk here. After even-
tually realizing that Scaife 
Hall was the old looking one 
with a large chip-shaped 
structure protruding from 
its facade, I entered with  
caution. Maybe this was some 
sort of old prison turned  
museum type of places? 
Maybe the reamins of some 
sort of medieval castle gone 
retro. I decided that the 
former was likely the case. 
As I stood on the inside of 
the buildings and looked out, 
or rather attempting to look 
out, I wondered how odd it 
must be for anyone to stay 
inside this building for long 
periods of time. There were 
black bars, which ran both 
vertically and horizontally 
on every window, that pro-
duced an almost shrinking 
feeling within each rooms. I 
remember thinking, “Imag-
ine trying to learn in here!” 
Another peculiar thing about 
this place was that each room 
contained almost 70 desks, 
despite my estimation that it 
probably comfortably seats 
around 20 people. There is 
also no real stairwell. Just 
the stairs that also double 
as the emergency exit. One 
could also opt for the eleva-
tor, just be careful. It shakes 
in somehow ?ve different di-
rections. I guess that’s part of 
the old jailhouse turned mu-
seum aesthetic. Scaife had 
this weird, edgy Tumblr vibe I 
would never be able to grasp.
I decided to risk it and took 
the rickety elevator down 
to the basement, but as the 
doors opened and I took my 
?rst step out, I was stopped 
by a large man in a long black 
coat. He told me I didn’t be-
long here, and I was instruct-
ed to head back upstairs. I 
later found out that the base-
ment was where they kept all 
of the mechanical engineers 
that never get their mouse-
trap car projects to work.
I ran back upstairs and 
out the back door of Scaife, 
which opened into what ap-
pear to be a construction site. 
Mildly confused and substan-
tially worried, I quickly sur-
veyed my surroundings for a 
way out. With a large Prin-
gle-shaped monster to my 
right and a steep hill to my 
left, I panicked. I ran straight 
into the building in front 
of me, which I later found 
out was Hamerschlag Hall. 
I eventually found my bear-
ings and made it home safe 
a few days later. Although 
visiting Scaife was the clos-
est I’d ever gotten to ?nding 
a portal to hell, I did see some 
great things along the way. 
My favorite was the large 
glass ceiling in the Atrium. 
It was beautiful, and you can 
trust me on this one. I know 
a lot about glass ceilings.
Greek community communes together as a community
JOEY PEISER
Buys his friends
This year’s Greek Sing 
event once again proved that 
the talented Greek community 
can come together and cel-
ebrate their achievements as a 
community. The annual cele-
bration has raised hundreds of 
thousands of dollars for chari-
ties such as St. Jude’s Chil-
dren’s Research Hospital and 
Our — not your — Clubhouse, 
and this year’s event saw 
members of the Greek com-
munity showcase their talents 
in an impressive demonstra-
tion of community. Members 
of the Greek community had 
a lot to say about this year’s 
talent and what Greek Sing 
means for their community. 
“It’s just so amazing what 
this community is capable of 
when we come together as a 
community. Greek Sing is not 
just an important event for 
the Greek community, but the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
and larger Pittsburgh com-
munity as well,” said junior 
design major and Greek com-
munity member Jessica Stiles. 
“The positive impact our sing-
ing and dancing has on the 
community is really felt when 
we stroll into Our Clubhouse 
and all of our friends are there 
and smiling like one big happy 
community,” said senior social 
history and technical writing 
and communication double 
major Dan Comstock. Associ-
ate Director of Greek Life Jesse 
Koch also praised the Greek 
community on its impressive 
self-congratulation efforts 
as a community. “This com-
munity means so much more 
than other communities, it’s 
a community where one can 
be a part of a great commu-
nity that communities harder 
than any other community I’ve 
ever seen. I’m community of 
you guys, and I hope you keep 
communicating your commu-
nity for every other commu-
nity to see.”
Plastic spoon to be named in honor of a gradually decaying David Tepper 
JOEY PEISER
Mad about Midway
A spoon used by sopho-
more business administra-
tion major Jeremy Mahan 
last Wednesday to sample the 
cream of chicken soup at The 
Exchange has been of?cially 
renamed in honor of hedge 
fund manager and Carnegie 
Mellon benefactor David A. 
Tepper. President Subra 
Suresh announced the re-
naming in a press conference, 
expressing his gratitude to 
Mr. Tepper for his continued 
generosity to the school. 58-
year old Tepper, whose vast 
fortune will fail to protect him 
from the unstoppable march 
of time, was awarded the hon-
or for informing an Entropy 
cashier that she could “keep 
the change.” Receipt records 
revealed the exact amount to 
be 37 cents remaining from 
a purchase of a bottle of Fiji 
water.
“Once again, David Tep-
per has demonstrated a kind-
ness and support of our school 
that is unmatched. We hope 
that this plastic spoon, which 
shall bear his name alongside 
our school of business and its 
buildings, reminds Mr. Tepper 
that we will never run out of 
things to rename in his honor 
so long as he has money to 
give us,” Suresh said during 
the announcement.
Mahan, when asked 
about his thoughts on the 
Tepper spoon, expressed 
confusion over whether a  
worthy spoon had been cho-
sen. “What spoon? The one I 
used to try the soup, the cream 
of chicken? Yeah it was pretty 
good, decided to get a salad. 
They named it after Tepper? 
Couldn’t they just pick a new 
one from the basket? Seems 
stupid.” 
Several students have 
expressed concern about 
a plastic spoon not being 
enough to thank Tepper for 
his generous donations over 
the year. Senior business ad-
ministration major, Tiffany 
Jackson, responded “I mean 
the spoon should at least be a 
real one. Or maybe someone 
should wash it beforehand. 
It’s kinda gross to have some 
random guy’s spit on it if it’s 
going to be displayed some-
where” when asked what her 
thoughts were on the honor-
ing of Tepper in plastic spoon 
form. Despite many students 
not caring or responding “Oh 
I didn’t know Tepper was still 
alive. I just assumed he was 
another dead guy that was 
an ex-CMU president,” Carn-
egie Mellon of?cials seemed 
very excited about the spoon 
and invited Tepper to the an-
nouncement of the spoon.
Tepper was visibly moved 
during the announcement 
by the honor bestowed upon 
him, and concluded the cer-
emony with an expression of 
gratitude. He was overcome 
with gratitude as he used a 
$100 bill to wipe his tears. 
“It is the dream of every ab-
surdly wealthy man, from 
Andrew Carnegie to Andrew 
Mellon, to mock the face of 
death and achieve immortal-
ity through the charade of 
charitable giving. I will not 
rest until every square foot of 
this Earth bears the name of 
Tepper, and I thank Carnegie 
Mellon for their help in my 
aggressive campaign to quell 
the existential dread of my ap-
proaching demise. I’d like to 
dedicate this spoon to a school 
that could potentially one day 
bear the name Tepper Univer-
sity. Hell, why just stop here 
in Pittsburgh? Here’s to our  
universe, the Tepper Way.” 
A replica of the spoon will 
be on display in Tepper Hall 
as Tepper himself has elected 
to keep the original spoon in 
his possession. He is also ru-
moured to have a gold plated 
version of the spoon that he 
will use to eat every single one 
of his meals for the rest of his 
life. The spoon is expected to 
retain the Tepper name until 
its plastic ?nally breaks down 
in several millennia, thus en-
suring that Mr. Tepper’s ?nite 
existence on this planet is 
 validated.
Joseph Peiser/Figured this out as he went along
“Each room contained almost 
70 desks, despite my estimation 
that it probably comfortably 
seats around 20 people.”

Entropy+ has long been 
servicing the fruit needs of 
the students of Carnegie Mel-
lon. With a wide variety from 
apples, to bananas, to the oc-
casional mango, Entropy+ 
consistently provides a quality 
of fruit that is de?nitely equiv-
alent to how much we pay to 
go to this school. It should 
come as no surprise that this 
farmers market quality fruit 
has attracted the attention of 
other countries, and they like 
what they see. Entropy+ has 
been named the world’s top 
fruit exporter, leaving China, 
India, and Brazil in its wake.
All of the Carnegie Mel-
lon community is very excited 
about this news. “I have always 
loved getting the fruit here. I 
?ll out every survey on time 
in hopes of getting a free treat 
from Entropy+. I always go 
straight to the apples because 
there’s always something in 
them. I can’t quite put my ?n-
ger on it, but it tastes great,” 
says India Price of the on cam-
pus convenience store. With 
this large outsourcing of fruit 
however, many students are 
concerned about their ability 
to still recieve it. It was a much 
appreciated campus conve-
nience and students want to 
make sure it is still available.
A Gallup poll of Carnegie 
Mellon students revealed that 
as a whole, the student body 
is indeed hungry for apples. 
92 percent of students ques-
tioned responded that they, 
in fact, like them apples and 
would enjoy a glossy red  
delicious or granny smith 
anytime, anywhere. Further, 
a whopping 98 percent of 
students responded that on-
campus eateries, especially 
Entropy, carried the most 
mouth-watering apples they’d 
ever laid eyes on. “The apples at  
Entropy are so perfectly round 
and consistent in color, that 
sometimes I just walk by them 
and admire them for the el-
egant portraits of nature’s 
bounty that they are”, raved 
First-year engineering student 
Sam Miller. Culinart is report-
edly planning on capitalizing 
on the developing apple craze 
by accepting DineX as a form 
a payment for fruit exports. 
Needless to say, students have 
decided to capitalize on this 
decision and have fruit im-
ported directly to their front 
doors. Students will be able to 
import fruit from Entropy+ by 
?lling out a form on Student 
Information Online (SIO) 
under the new tab entitled 
“fruit imports” throughout 
the semester. Some students 
complained that using SIO has 
made exporting harder.
The fruit of Entropy+ has 
increased the health and hap-
piness of campus. In a state-
ment realesed by Entropy+’s 
Culinart employees to The Tar-
tan, “[Entropy+] will strive to 
always serve the freshest and 
most nutritious fruit to the 
students across campus. We 
have always, and will always 
put our students’ nutritional 
needs above all else.” The Tar-
tan would like to issue a sin-
cere thank you to Entropy+ on 
behalf of the student body for 
their dedicated service. 
Entropy named world’s top exporter of fruit, students capitalize on apples
Theodore Teichman/Ties a tight manbun
“I have always loved getting the 
fruit there. I ?ll out every survey 
on time in hopes of getting a free 
treat from [Entropy+].”

On Wednesday March 
6, Democratic presidential 
candidate Hillary Clinton 
held a campaign rally in Skibo 
Gymnasium. The space was 
?lled to full capacity, hold-
ing over 1,500 people in the 
gym with many others left 
outside in a line stretching 
well around the block. Clin-
ton addressed the large crowd 
that was stuck outside before 
giving her speech. Mean-
while, inside Skibo, a selec-
tion of songs, including Kelly 
Clarkson’s “I’m a Survivor,” 
played in the background for 
the waiting crowd.
The event started with 
Julia Eddy, Chair of the 
Carnegie Mellon Graduate 
Senate. Eddy spoke about 
Carnegie Mellon’s poten-
tial for excellence, which 
she highlighted by asking 
students to help ?nd a cure 
for Alzheimer’s disease by 
2025. She additionally spoke 
about the success of the 
democratic process based 
on the turnout of so many 
students at the rally.
There were several other 
highlights from Carnegie Mel-
lon students, including per-
formances by senior drama 
major Avery Smith who sang 
the national anthem and the 
a cappella group Soundbytes 
which performed two pieces. 
Two campaign organizers, 
a second generation immi-
grant and a woman, made 
brief comments about their 
support for Clinton before 
Clinton herself took the stage.
Cheers of “I’m with her!” 
?lled the gymnasium as Clin-
ton made her way to the stage 
with the mayor of Pittsburgh, 
Bill Peduto. Peduto gave sev-
eral remarks praising Clinton, 
saying that “others talk of 
building walls, but Pittsburgh 
is a city of bridges.” He stated 
that many progressive mayors 
like him around the country 
are endorsing Clinton as a 
unifying candidate to create 
an “America for all.”
Clinton began her speech 
by talking about Pittsburgh as 
a “great American city,” prais-
ing its ability to adapt into the 
future, and stating that one 
can have “resilience if you are 
resourceful.” She also subtly 
criticized Republican front-
runner Donald Trump saying 
that “diversity is an asset” 
and, referring to his plan to 
build a wall on the Mexican 
border, stated that she wants 
to “knock down every barrier

Carnegie Mellon joins national effort to bring functional fabrics and materials to the market
DEBORAH CHU
Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon has joined 
a new national research in-
stitute called the Advanced 
Functional Fabrics of America 
(AFFOA) that conducts re-
search on new ?bers, fabrics, 
and materials and integrates 
them into products ranging 
from active wear to protective 
armor. The institute aims 
to “accelerate widespread 
commercialization of highly 
functional fabrics,” as stated 
on AFFOA’s website. The $75 
million national non-pro?t 
will serve as a resource for in-
dustry and government, con-
necting various companies 
with the expertise of academic 
researchers.
“Recent breakthroughs 
in ?ber materials and 
manufacturing processes will 
soon allow us to design and 
produce fabrics that see, hear, 
sense, communicate, store 
and convert energy, regulate 
temperature, monitor health, 
and change color — the 
dawn of a ‘fabric revolution,’” 
AFFOA says on its website.
Currently, the AFFOA 
group includes 31 academic 
institutions, including Carn-
egie Mellon, Cornell Universi-
ty, The Ohio State University, 
the University of Michigan, 
and the University of Califor-
nia, Davis. 16 companies are 
named as industry partners, 
including Nike, Microsoft, 
Goodyear, The North Face, 
Bose, and Medtronic. In ad-
dition, 26 start-up incubators 
and venture capital groups 
have pledged support, includ-
ing Angel Capital Associations, 
Westbury Partners, and North 
Bridge Venture Partners.
AFFOA has been formally 
recognized, as announced by 
Secretary of Defense Ashton 
Carter at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology last 
week, as one of the White 
House’s National Networks 
for Manufacturing Innovation 
(NNMI) institutes. The NNMI 
is a $317 million public-private 
initiative aiming to boost the 
value of American-made prod-
ucts internationally through 
innovative research and 
development.
“The AFFOA initiative will 
provide unique opportunities 
for Carnegie Mellon to en-
able new materials, devices, 
systems, and applications. 
The integration of sensors 
and actuators in electronic 
textiles and smart fabrics can 
help widen the use of existing 
applications and open new 
applications in health, educa-
tion, transportation, or Inter-
net of things,” Diana Marcu-
lescu, professor of electrical 
and computer engineering at 
Carnegie Mellon, said in an 
interview with the University. 
Marculescu leads a group of 
faculty that develops electron-
ic textiles with novel proper-
ties by embedding processing, 
sensing, and actuation.
Carnegie Mellon will be 
part of a research hub, led 
by Drexel University, that 
assembles partners in the 
mid-Atlantic region and 
links research institutions 
such as Penn State, Temple 
University, and the University 
of Delaware to manufactur-
ing and investment partners 
such as DuPont, Ben Franklin 
Technology Partners of South-
east Pennsylvania, the City of 
Philadelphia Of?ce of Manu-
facturing and Industry, and 
the Pennsylvania Department 
of Community and Economic 
Development.
This research hub will lead 
investigations in modeling, 
designing, and predicting the 
utility of new ?bers, yarns, 
and materials, and will apply 
those new materials to proto-
types of functional fabrics for 
apparel, health care, transpor-
tation, consumer electronics, 
architecture, and the defense 
industry.
“I strongly believe that AF-
FOA offers an unparalleled op-
portunity for developing our 
workforce,” Marculescu said. 
“Indeed, new generations of 
scientists and engineers will 
be trained in integrating sen-
sors, actuators, and photonics 
into wearable clothing fabrics. 
We are looking forward to be-
ing part of AFFOA and con-
necting with other academic 
and industrial members.”

The ?rst instance of 
Hadick misusing his allo-
cation was when he used 
SBVPO money to buy jack-
ets and polo shirts for the 
Committee on Student Or-
ganizations [CoSO]. The 
cost also includes embroi-
dery of said clothing. The 
jackets were given to the 
CoSO directors, including 
Hadick. This appears to 
be in violation of the Joint 
Funding Committee (JFC) 
Bylaws, which applies to 
Student Government funds 
via Article V Section A of 
the Student Government 
Constitution. The bylaws 
state in Article 5, Section 
D, Item 1, on lines 240–41, 
that JFC funds cannot be 
used for “personal equip-
ment, which is de?ned as 
equipment or clothing that 
will not be available for 
use by future members of 
an organization.”
The total cost of these 
items was slightly under 
$900.
The clothing itself does 
not become a violation 
until ?scal close. When 
asked to comment, Hadick 
claimed he was pursuing 
avenues to cover expenses, 
including having members 
pay for the clothing and 
raising revenue through 
fundraising, but no tan-
gible action has been taken 
at this time to remedy the 
situation. The dates of the 
transactions span from 
Jan. 8 to 19.
There were also some 
potentially problematic 
activities with allocations 
of SBVPO funds, speci?-
cally the Collaborative 
Fund that is available for 
organizations to apply for 
via the Common Funding 
Application on The Bridge.
CMU hosts weekend summit on US and China Innovation
SINEAD FOLEY
Forum Editor
This past weekend Carnegie 
Mellon hosted the ?fth annual 
CMU Summit on US-China In-
novation and Entrepreneur-
ship. Since 2012 the Summit 
has “attracted over 3,000 
participants and 100 industry 
leaders” to campus to discuss 
the latest advances and chal-
lenges for people working in 
technical ?elds. The Summit 
is a massive event that works 
to bring students and indus-
try leaders from all across the 
U.S. and China together for a 
schedule packed with speech-
es, discussions, and network-
ing events.
This year’s Summit was 
broken down into ?ve major 
topics, each featuring a key-
note speech in the morning 
followed by a panel discus-
sion and question-and-answer 
session. The ?ve pillars of 
the event were ?nance, high 
technology, energy and sus-
tainability, innovation and 
entrepreneurship, and start-
ups. Energy and sustainability, 
?nance, and innovation and 
entrepreneurship are regular 
topics for the conference, hav-
ing been discussed in previous 
years. Meanwhile, the focus on 
high technology, speci?cally 
the power of arti?cial intelli-
gence (AI), and start-ups were 
new, re?ecting new trends 
in the ever-changing ?eld of 
technology.
The weekend was opened 
and closed by ?ve distinguished 
keynote speakers. Carnegie 
Mellon professors Terrence J. 
Collins and Tuomas Sandholm 
joined entrepreneurs Feng 
Li, Ning Yang, and Bo Tao in 
shaping the discussions dozens 
of panelists and hundreds of 
attendees would have over the 
weekend.
The ?rst topic, ?nance, 
sparked lively discussion 
about the future of ?nancial 
technology, or “?ntech.” De-
regulation was the word of the 
hour, with panelists weigh-
ing in to a packed auditorium 
on how ?ntech can facilitate 
free global trade with mini-
mal regulation. The question-
and-answer session followed a 
similar theme. Panelists ?elded 
questions about the effect of 
the 2008 Great Recession on 
the ?ntech industry and how 
future regulation might change 
the landscape. The panelists 
pointed out that ?ntech had 
grown ever more important 
since 2008 as traditional banks 
were restricted by regulations 
but new, technology – based 
enterprises remained relatively 
deregulated and free. Tone 
Vays, panelist and head of re-
search at BraveNewCoin, said 
that recent threats to regulate 
the industry, particularly from 
presidential candidate Bernie 
Sanders, “may be the best 
thing that’s ever happened to 
the industry” because ?ntech 
is by nature impossible to regu-
late, and the more people try 
to accomplish this the clearer 
that will become to consum-
ers. When asked to look into 
the future of ?ntech, panelist 
and Carnegie Mellon professor 
Timothy X. Brown summed it 
up best, saying the future will 
be a process of “evolution, not 
revolution.”

The 76th annual William 
Lowell Putnam Competition, 
a mathematics competition 
for undergraduate students, 
took place in December of 
last year. It was recently an-
nounced that the team from 
Carnegie Mellon University 
landed second place in this 
prestigious competition. 
This marks the ?fth consecu-
tive year that a team from 
Carnegie Mellon has landed 
among the top ?ve teams in 
this competition, thus mak-
ing Carnegie Mellon home 
to many of the nation’s best 
math experts.
The competition took 
place on Dec. 5, 2015, with 
4,275 undergraduate stu-
dents from 554 institutions in 
America and Canada partici-
pating in the event. Students 
utilized their creative think-
ing and concepts knowledge 
taught in college mathemati-
cal courses to solve 12 com-
plex mathematical problems 
in the course of six hours.
Representing Carnegie 
Mellon University was senior 
science and humanities 
scholar Linus Hamilton, ju-
nior mathematical sciences 
major Thomas Swayze, and 
sophomore mathemati-
cal sciences major Joshua 
Brakensiek.
“Teaching our students 
problem-solving skills that 
will help them to succeed in 
all of their future endeavors 
is at the heart of our math 
curriculum,” said Po-Shen 
Loh, an associate professor 
of mathematical sciences 
at Carnegie Mellon and the 
team’s coach. “Our sustained 
success in the Putnam shows 
that some of the best math 
students are gathering here 
at Carnegie Mellon and 
thriving.”
The efforts of these stu-
dents has allowed Carn-
egie Mellon’s Department of 
Mathematical Sciences in the 
Mellon College of Science to 
receive $20,000, with each 
of the three team members 
receiving an $800 cash prize.
Carnegie Mellon team places second in 76th annual Putnam Math Competition
Carnegie Mellon School of Drama faculty members win awards for costume design
Carnegie Mellon School 
of Drama faculty members 
Susan Tsu, Bessie F. Ana-
than Professor of Costume 
Design, and Suttirat Larlarb, 
associate professor of cos-
tume design, have won the 
Theatre Development Fund 
Irene Sharaff Award. The 
award is regarded as being 
a high honor for American 
costume designers.
Tsu, an active costume 
designer for 40 years, has 
been awarded the Lifetime 
Achievement Award and Lar-
larb has been awarded the 
Young Master Award.
Tsu’s designs have been 
included in hits such as 
“Godspell” and “The Joy 
Luck Club.”
“Of course it’s a great hon-
or,” Tsu said in a statement 
to the University. “When I 
think about the number of 
incredibly talented design-
ers in this country and some 
of the people I’m following 
and the number of design-
ers I’ve been in?uenced and 
inspired by, I feel even more 
honored to be recognized in 
this way.”
Larlarb’s work has been 
included in the opening 
ceremony of the 2012 Lon-
don Olympics, in the re-
cent biopic Steve Jobs, and 
in the Broadway musical 
“Finding Neverland.”
In a statement to the 
University Larlarb states 
“When I came back from 
the Olympics, after doing 
something that massive and 
that impactful on the world, 
it almost seemed greedy to 
just keep building my career 
without giving something 
back ... Part of me was com-
ing to teaching because I 
wanted to try to instill the 
things I’d seen and learned 
and observed and challenge 
students to be better.”
The awards ceremony 
will take place on May 20 in 
New York City.

Cuba runs low on beer supply during recent tourist spike
HAVANA — Cuba has

Summit adresses technical fields 
promising “insights on the 
cutting-edge issues in Arti?-
cial Intelligence.” The panel 
wrestled with the fundamen-
tal questions of the AI indus-
try such as what AI is, what 
problems it should try to 
solve, and how it will change 
our lives. Some panelists ad-
vocated for AI that melds with 
the arts, envisioning technol-
ogy that facilitates creation 
and eliminates mental drudg-
ery so people have more time 
to spend on creativity and 
entertainment. Others saw AI 
technology in a more scientif-
ic context as a tool to person-
alize healthcare, remove inef-
?ciencies, and produce and 
analyze theories the human 
mind cannot grasp.
The ?nal panel on Saturday 
focused on energy and sus-
tainability. This panel was the 
most technical, speci?c, and 
down to earth of the three, 
addressing the opportunities 
and challenges the industry 
faces from government policy, 
changes in prices of oil and 
natural gas, and consumer in-
terests. One panelist summed 
up the mood of the discussion, 
saying, “we’re moving the 
needle, but not fast enough.” 
The governments in both the 
U.S. and particularly China 
are pushing for clean energy 
by providing incentives to the 
private sector to invest, but 
these steps are tempered by 
economic concerns. Consum-
ers are beginning to invest 
in sustainable products, but 
many remain apathetic about 
the issue. Finally, technologi-
cal developments like smart 
meters, meters that provide 
information on how much 
energy a particular house-
hold or area is using, have 
helped create an energy sup-
ply system more conducive to 
clean power, but there is still 
a lot more progress needed on 
issues like energy storage.
The Sunday panels 
provided platforms for in-
dustry leaders to discuss and 
give advise on how to navi-
gate technological ?elds. The 
start-up panel brought en-
trepreneurs from a variety 
of start-ups together to give 
advice on getting ideas off the 
ground and turning a concept 
into a company. According to 
the program, the innovation 
and entrepreneurship panel 
is “dedicated to creating a 
platform for prestigious inves-
tors and entrepreneurs from 
both China and the U.S. to 
network, share experiences, 
and exchange ideas” and to 
“promote a bilateral dialogue 
and cooperation between the 
two countries.” This year the 
panel spotlighted the robotics 
industry.
The Summit also invited 
attendees to take an active 
role. There were networking 
sessions after every panel dis-
cussion, and the New Venture 
Competition asked teams of 
student entrepreneurs to cre-
ate start-up solutions to real 
world problems. The competi-
tion was judged based on real 
world feasibility and likeli-
hood of economic success and 
offered a $15,000 cash prize 
to the winning team.
The entire event offered 
invaluable opportunities to 
technology-focused students 
in terms of information, 
experience, and connections.

Hillary Clinton organizes rally in Skibo
citizens] from achieving their 
God-given potential.”
She organized a large 
portion of her speech around 
three tests a president should 
be ready to face, tests that 
she claimed prove her to be 
a progressive who has and 
will continue to make prog-
ress. These tests were “Who 
have you helped?”, “Have you 
kept us safe?”, and “Can you 
unify us?”
For her ?rst test, she 
discussed her plans to help 
the working class, including 
creating a national infrastruc-
ture bank to ?x our infrastruc-
ture. Additionally, she called 
for $10 billion to invest in 
research for new technolo-
gies to begin exporting from 
the United States. She took 
the opportunity to share how 
the Carnegie Mellon Robot-
ics team is a leading example 
of how America can bring its 
manufacturing industry into 
the new century.
Clinton went on to discuss 
her plans to combat climate 
change, such as bringing 
half a billion more solar pan-
els into the United States 
by 2020, and by overseeing 
a North American climate 
agreement. “I actually listen 
to the scientists,” she said, 
adding that Carnegie Mel-
lon could help teach Repub-
lican climate change deniers. 
Discussing her experience as 
a ?ghter for climate agree-
ments in the past, she relayed 
an anecdote about her and 
President Obama’s mission 
to “stalk the Chinese and the 
Indians” at the 2009 Climate 
Conference in Copenhagen. 
According to Clinton, she and 
Obama successfully snuck 
past bodyguards and joined 
the “secret” meeting of the 
Chinese and Indian of?cials 
who had been avoiding them. 
Clinton also hailed the results 
of the most recent Paris Cli-
mate Conference in 2015. Al-
though some have criticized 
the conference as not taking 
enough action, Clinton said 
“don’t let the perfect be the 
enemy of the good.”
Clinton then spoke about 
her economic platform, pro-
claiming her support for 
a livable minimum wage, 
equal pay for women, and 
small businesses of the type 
that often begin at Carnegie 
Mellon. “The economy does 
better with a Democrat in of-
?ce,” she said, calling back 
to the federal government’s 
balanced budget and sur-
plus under her husband Bill 
Clinton’s presidency as well 
as President Obama’s ac-
complishments while in of-
?ce. “[Obama] doesn’t get 
the credit he deserves,” she 
said, to widespread applause, 
while Republicans continue 
“peddling the same economic 
snake oil.”
Although Clinton did not 
specify her position on how 
much the minimum wage 
should be raised, The Tartan 
asked Mayor Bill Peduto after 
the rally to address the pos-
sibility of a higher minimum 
wage in Pittsburgh and na-
tionwide. According to Pedu-
to, Pittsburgh is “on the path” 
to phasing in a $15 minimum 
wage over several years until 
2019, with UPMC recently 
joining a two-year discussion. 
He has focused his efforts to 
raise the minimum wage on 
the local middle class and 
service workers. “Pittsburgh 
built the middle class,” said 
Peduto, and the city can “look 
at the same model again” 
as “part of a new economy.” 
Peduto expressed his support 
for a national minimum wage 
of $15 if it can be comfortably 
phased in over several years.
Clinton pledged to ?ght 
against the privatization of 
social security, to ?x the Vet-
eran’s Administration, and 
expand the Affordable Care 
Act. She also said she would 
“end Citizens United” and its 
attempt to make “more mon-
ey equal more speech” in the 
federal government.
She promised to work to-
ward universal pre-kindergar-
ten and debt-free college edu-
cation through re?nancing 
and complete debt forgive-
ness after 20 years. We must 
“end the government making 
money off lending money,” 
she said.
She asserted her 
commitment to the pro-choice 
movement, marriage equality, 
equal voting rights, “common 
sense” gun regulations, and 
immigration reform with a 
“path to citizenship.”
To answer her second qual-
i?cation of security, she called 
on her experience as Secre-
tary of State. Clinton said 
that as president she would 
ensure that national security 
was “not an afterthought.” 
She mentioned her role in the 
military operation that killed 
terrorist leader Osama Bin 
Laden, as well as her success-
ful nuclear arms negotiations 
with Russia that lessened the 
“biggest immediate threat” to 
national security.
Clinton expressed her dis-
content with her Republican 
contenders, saying that she 
was running an “issue-orient-
ed” rather than an “insult-ori-
ented” campaign. 
With a Republican in the 
presidential of?ce, she said, 
“we will not recognize our 
country.” Trump in particular 
she called “deeply disturbing” 
in his attempts to “incite 
prejudice and paranoia.”
Finally, she portrayed 
herself as a uniter of the party. 
She contrasted herself with 
obstructionist Republicans in 
the commitment she has dem-
onstrated in her career to “go 
anywhere to meet common 
ground.” For her entire adult 
life, Clinton said, she has 
stayed “in the trenches” and 
has done the “boring but nec-
essary kind of work.” Thank-
ing the crowd once again and 
urging them to vote, Clinton 
exited the stage to the sound 
of “Fight Song” by Rachel 
Platten.
At a booth across the 
street from the rally, several 
supporters of fellow Demo-
cratic presidential candidate 
Bernie Sanders were less en-
thusiastic about Clinton. One 
young man said that there are 
“lots of people who are un-
decided” in the primary race, 
and they “don’t know they 
have a better option.” While 
attendees for the Clinton rally 
waited in line, the Sanders 
supporters campaigned for 
their own candidate and so-
licited volunteers for his cam-
paign. They described their 
efforts as “really successful,” 
claiming that they answered 
people’s “legitimate concerns” 
about their candidate and 
that many attendees “turned 
to Bernie on the spot.”
Attendees of the rally 
called it “surreal” and “won-
derful,” and described Clinton 
as a “down to earth” woman 
who has “made a real differ-
ence in people’s lives.” 
One college student said 
that it was his ?rst rally and 
he was “happy to get in” for 
an event that “really did touch 
[him].”
The Pennsylvania primary 
is on April 26.

RALLY, from B1
Investigation by The Tartan reveals potential misuse of funds by current SBVPO
FUNDS, from B1
After an email requesting 
information on funding, Had-
ick sent another Student Gov-
ernment of?cial documenta-
tion of the expenses of the 
Collaborative Fund. In this 
email, Hadick reported that he 
had allocated $1,000 to Wom-
en’s Club Soccer to offset the 
costs of a spring recreational 
league.
There is no evidence avail-
able to us to suggest that Wom-
en’s Club Soccer received any 
allocation from the Collabora-
tive Fund. This allocation does 
not appear on the Women’s 
Club Soccer Team’s transac-
tions, nor does Women’s Club 
Soccer appear in the list of 
Collaborative Fund applicants. 
We have been unable to reach 
representatives of Women’s 
Club Soccer for comment.
There is, however, evidence 
of an allocation of $1,000 from 
the SBVPO account to the AC 
Mellon Men’s Soccer Team 
that was stated to be for spring 
recreational league fees.
The journal entry transfer 
request shows the reason 
for the transfer as “Special 
Allocation: The mens [sic] 
and womens [sic] team will 
be try [sic] to organize rec 
[sic] events in the spring. 
This is their new initiative.” 
It is unclear what is meant by 
“organize” in this context.
In addition to SBVPO, Had-
ick serves as the co-president 
and authorized signer of AC 
Mellon Men’s Soccer.
Evidence of the allocation 
appears on both the SBVPO 
and AC Mellon Men’s Soccer 
accounts, and both transac-
tions were processed on Feb. 
9, 2016. Again, there was no 
application to support this 
allocation.
When asked for comment, 
Hadick encouraged us to re-
view the list of applications. 
We did ?nd two applications 
under AC Mellon Men’s Soc-
cer for the Common Fund, 
but they do not correspond to 
the $1,000 from Feb. 9. One 
application is an extension of 
the other, and they jointly re-
quested funding from Senate 
and GSA to cover expenses 
related to a tournament from 
October. These applications 
were individually created and 
submitted within the bylaws of 
Student Government and are 
not potential transgressions 
on their own.
Our investigation is 
ongoing.
Update (April 6. 2016): An 
of?cial from Women’s Club 
Soccer claims not to have re-
ceived any funds from this al-
location, nor to be enrolled in 
a spring recreational league.
Update (April 10, 2016): 
Multiple of?cials from Wom-
en’s Club Soccer claimed to 
have no knowledge of the 
transfer request they are listed 
on.
Further, The Tartan has ac-
quired applicants to the Com-
mon Funding Application. We 
?ltered it for requests to the 
SBVPO for Collaborative Fund 
money. The only discrepancy 
between this document and 
the one uploaded by Hadick 
in a response to this article is 
the presence of “Club Soccer” 
in Hadick’s document. Hadick 
did not respond to a request 
for comment. The document 
can be found on the online 
version of the article. Person-
ally identi?able information 
has been redacted for privacy

With NY primary approaching, Democrats get in the mud
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Publisher
Ahead of the New York 
primary on April 19, Senator 
Bernie Sanders (I–VT) and 
Former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton have gotten 
themselves tied up in a media 
back-and-forth.
This week’s victory in Wis-
consin looked like a turning 
point for the Sanders cam-
paign. Even though Clinton 
still leads the race by 219 del-
egates, Sanders’ performances 
since March 22 have claimed 
him 181 delegates to Clinton’s 
102. Now the 247 delegates 
to be doled out in New York 
mean more than before. The 
pressure is on Sanders to keep 
up his momentum, and even 
more so for Clinton to main-
tain her once-powerful lead.
However, the news has not 
been all good for the senator. 
Sanders’ credibility was dam-
aged early this week when his 
answers in an interview with 
The New York Daily News left 
voters feeling unsettled. His 
answers about breaking up big 
banks and foreign policy had 
many people openly question-
ing his policy knowledge.
Clinton also began to ?oat 
attacks on Senator Sanders. 
On Wednesday morning, 
following her defeat in Wis-
consin, Clinton made waves 
on her press rounds when 
Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s 
“Morning Joe” directly asked 
Clinton four times if she ?nds 
Sanders quali?ed for the 
presidency. She never an-
swered him with a yes or no, 
but conceded that she felt he 
“hadn’t done his homework.” 
In a write-up of the interview, 
The Washington Post lent it the 
headline “Clinton questions 
whether Sanders is quali?ed 
to be president”.
Also on Wednesday, Po-
litico’s podcast “Off Message” 
published an interview with 
Clinton from Friday, April 1, 
where she jabbed, “[Sanders 
is] a relatively new Democrat, 
and, in fact, I’m not even sure 
he is one.”
Finally, CNN posted a re-
port on Clinton’s New York 
strategy that they boiled down 
to three points: “Disqualify 
him, defeat him, and unify the 
party later.”
Sanders ended the day 
in Philadelphia ramping up 
his offense in response to 
the perceived attacks from 
the Clinton camp. At a rally 
hosted by Temple University, 
Sanders suggested that “The 
American people may want to 
wonder about [her] quali?ca-
tions when [she’s] spending 
an enormous amount of time 
raising money for [her] super 
PAC from some of the wealthi-
est people in this country and 
from the most outrageous spe-
cial interests.” He also called 
into question her stance on the 
Iraq War and her voting record 
on “disastrous” trade agree-
ments that resulted in Ameri-
can jobs being outsourced.
Within minutes of Sanders’ 
remark hitting the press, 
Clinton took the high road 
on ABC News, saying, “Let’s 
keep our eye on what’s re-
ally at stake in this election. 
We have Republicans whose 
values are so antithetical to 
what’s right for New York or 
right for America, and I’m just 
going to keep doing what I’ve 
been doing.” Clinton support-
ers also noted that she herself 
never questioned Sanders’ 
quali?cations.
Since then, some observers 
have found Sanders remarks 
about Clinton’s quali?cations 
to be sexist. Sanders has back-
tracked into a more compli-
cated stance, claiming that 
she’s both quali?ed and un-
quali?ed. In an appearance on 
The View on Friday, Sanders 
repeated his disapproval of 
Clinton’s support of big banks, 
the Iraq War, and NAFTA, but 
acknowledged her experience, 
speci?cally her success as First 
Lady. Sanders added that, re-
gardless of how the primaries 
go, he’d still rather see a Dem-
ocrat win the general than “a 
Donald Trump or some other 
right-wing Republican.”
Clinton and Sanders can 
agree on a common enemy 
for now, but on Friday, April 
14 at 9 p.m., they’ll return to 
their home turf in Brooklyn 
to face off in the next debate 
hosted by CNN and NY1. Clin-
ton still leads in polls, but with 
the rocky climate and Sand-
ers’ continuing gains, the New 
York primaries — and the 
Democratic Primary  — are far 
from being called.

GOP voters attempt to bar Trump from party nomination
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staff
With the Republican pri-
mary winnowed down to only 
three remaining candidates, 
the highly-touted “party forc-
es” that many claimed would 
stop the Donald Trump can-
didacy in its tracks are ?nally 
beginning to come into play. 
Recent results in two states, 
Utah and Wisconsin, show 
the election day vote coalesc-
ing around the most viable 
non-Trump candidate. This 
tactical voting could have the 
Grand Old Party hurtling to-
wards a contested convention 
to decide their nominee.
Utah was the ?rst indica-
tion that tactical voting had 
begun to take hold in the 
Republican party. FiveThir-
tyEight’s polls-only projec-
tions pegged Senator Ted 
Cruz (R–TX) to get 55.1 per-
cent of the vote, with Ohio 
Governor John Kasich grab-
bing 29.3 percent and Trump 
bringing up the rear with 13.8 
percent.
The actual result looked 
very similar for Trump, who 
?nished with 14 percent of 
the vote. However, Kasich’s 
numbers tanked and he ?n-
ished with 16.8 percent of the 
vote while Cruz dominated 
with 69.2 percent of the vote.
The narrative following 
the caucus was that Mormons 
were the tip of the anti-Trump 
spear. However, Trump lost 
across all demographic lines, 
not just with Mormons.
The lack of a secret ballot 
at a caucus makes it very easy 
for voters to just align with 
the most viable anti-Trump 
candidate, but it happened 
again in the primary in Wis-
consin, providing further evi-
dence of a shift towards either 
the party coalescing around 
Cruz or, more likely, the party 
attempting to deny Trump the 
nomination. FiveThirtyEight’s 
polls-only projection showed 
a tight race in this primary, 
with Cruz collecting 40.3 per-
cent of the vote to Trump’s 
36.3 percent. Trump again 
?nished quite close to his pro-
jection at 35.1 percent while 
Cruz rocketed all the way to 
48.2 percent, while Kasich 
lagged behind again.
Exit polls showed about 
half of Republicans indicating 
that they would be optimis-
tic or excited about a Kasich 
presidency, indicating that his 
support had not waned. His 
votes seemed to migrate to 
Cruz in order to stop Trump.
In a three candidate race 
it’s likely that Trump will need 
to start reaching the high 40s 
and low 50s in order to win 
states as more voters tactical-
ly migrate to whichever non-
Trump is leading the polls.
Another possibility is that 
the anti-Trump vote has truly 
shifted towards Cruz, as op-
posed to Cruz gaining votes 
over Kasich simply because 
he is more competitive with 
Trump. This hypothesis will 
be tested as the race moves to 
the Northeast where Kasich 
is far more competitive with 
Trump than Cruz.
An early indication of 
trouble for the Trump cam-
paign was his failure to top 
50 percent in any state. He 
still has not done so and, 
while his home state of New 
York seems to be a spot where 
that might happen, that trend 
would leave an opening for 
tactical voting to deny Trump 
state wins. Unlike the Demo-
crats, who allocate delegates 
entirely proportionally, Re-
publicans often give half or 
more delegates to the win-
ner in so-called “winner take 
all” states. If voters continue 
to barricade these delegates 
from Trump, it could spell 
doom for Trump’s avoidance 
of a convention.
A brokered convention 
does not guarantee that 
Trump will fail to win the 
nomination. He could con-
vince unbound delegates 
to vote for him and push 
him past the 1,237 delegate 
threshold on the ?rst or later 
ballots. However, Trump’s 
delegate operation has been 
incredibly slow to start and 
his historically high unfavor-
able numbers with the gen-
eral electorate will make him 
a very unattractive candidate 
to unbound delegates who 
tend to be party leaders or lo-
cal of?cials who would want 
to win the presidency. Fur-
ther, Trump’s tendency to do 
things such as incite violence 
at his rallies could make Re-
publicans fear for something 
as basic as the legitimacy of 
the vote if dissenters (or non 
dissenters who do not ?t into 
Trump’s conception of Ameri-
can) are threatened with 
physical violence.
Cruz was a pariah in the 
Republican party as recently 
as a month ago. Elected Re-
publicans have begun to en-
dorse him en masse, includ-
ing Senator Lindsey Graham 
(R–SC) who once said that 
killing Cruz on the Senate 
?oor would not result in a 
conviction from the Senate. 
It’s clear from the reaction to 
the ?eld winnowing down to 
just three candidates that a 
large portion of the Republi-
can is very opposed to Trump, 
and it seems like “not Trump” 
has become a viable candi-
date in itself.

Sanders extends winning streak with victory in Wisconsin
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Contributing Editor
Last Tuesday, Senator Ber-
nie Sanders (I–VT) won the 
Democratic primary in Wis-
consin, with 56.6 percent of 
the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 
43.1 percent. Wisconsin fol-
lows a string of Sanders victo-
ries, but will this hot streak be 
enough to power through to 
the presidential nomination?
From the beginning of the 
race, Sanders has challenged 
Clinton in an uphill battle for 
the Democrat nomination. 
In the recent primaries, how-
ever, things have began to 
look brighter for the Vermont 
senator, with victories in the 
past six states: Idaho, Utah, 
Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, 
and now Wisconsin.
However, as a group, these 
states are relatively small, are 
relatively white, and had open 
primaries. This means inde-
pendent voters and not just 
registered Democrats could 
vote. In addition, ?ve of the 
six were low-turnout prima-
ries. These characteristics put 
a damper on the momentum 
that the wins represent.
Because the states were 
smaller, Sanders is still behind 
in delegates. Sanders has gen-
erally won states with higher 
proportions of whites and 
lost states with more people 
of color, a pattern that held in 
this last stretch (Hawaii being 
an exception, not the rule). 
The independent voters who 
attend Democratic primaries 
have overwhelmingly sup-
ported Sanders over Clinton.
In Wisconsin, the trends 
continued as Clinton and 
Sanders were backed by their 
usual demographics. Accord-
ing to CNN exit polls, voters 
who were young, white, or 
independent heavily favored 
Sanders, whereas Clinton won 
in voters over 45 years old and 
people of color.
In a good showing by 
Sanders, however, women 
and registered Democrats 
both split evenly between the 
candidates. Past allegations 
that Sanders is only supported 
by “Bernie Bros” don’t hold 
up, although a higher percent-
age of men did support Sand-
ers. The even split among 
registered Democrats also 
shows that Sanders is making 
ground among the party faith-
ful, which had also tended to 
be more supportive of Clinton 
in the past.
Despite losing Wiscon-
sin, and several states before 
it, Clinton still is in a posi-
tion of power with her lead 
over Sanders. She congratu-
lated the senator on his win, 
while looking forward to the 
remaining states which are 
more likely to support her.
In Wyoming, Sanders won 
with 55.7 percent of the vote 
to Clinton’s 44.3 percent, with 
both candidates receiving 
seven delegates. The next pri-
mary takes place in New York 
on April 19. As Sanders’ birth-
place and Clinton’s adopted 
home, the state will be a hard-
fought battle.
Its 291 delegates make 
it immensely important for 
both candidates, and its di-
verse demographic makeup 
challenges the Sanders’ cam-
paign to gain more support 
among non-white voters. 
Another hurdle to Sanders is 
New York’s status as a closed 
primary, meaning only regis-
tered Democrats will be able 
to vote. Sanders will have to 
rely on registered Democrats 
only to see him through.
While the Wisconsin pri-
mary was a victory for Sand-
ers, he still has a way to go to 
before catching up with Clin-
ton. The race is still open for 
either candidate to take, and 
Sanders’ recent wins help his 
campaign but aren’t necessar-
ily a sign of upcoming domi-
nance. Similarly, while the 
run of losses for Clinton is a 
setback, she is still holding on 
to her lead. The Democratic 
primaries will likely go all the 
way to the end, as both candi-
dates hope for better results in 
the future.Zeke Rosenberg/Senior Staff, created on Venngage
Ted Cruz romps to blowout victory in Wisconsin Primary
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
With the primary season 
drawing to a close, establish-
ment Republicans are pulling 
out all the stops to prevent 
Donald Trump from claiming 
the Republican nomination. 
Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX) and 
Ohio Governor John Kasich 
continue to campaign in the 
hopes of forcing a brokered 
convention: their only hope of 
capturing the nomination.
On Tuesday, Wisconsin Re-
publicans turned out in what 
was seen as the point of no re-
turn if Trump managed to win 
the day. Instead, Cruz’s 13.1 
percentage point margin of 
victory transformed the narra-
tive into the latest obstacle to 
Trump taking command of the 
Republican Party. Cruz con-
sidered the night “a turning 
point ... [and] a rallying cry” 
for the hardworking people in 
America. Cruz earned 36 del-
egates to reach 517 total dele-
gates. The six delegates Trump 
obtained increases his total 
to 743. Trump would need 
to secure 60 percent of the 
remaining delegates to win 
the nomination outright, and 
Cruz would need 87 percent of 
them to achieve the same feat. 
With such high ?gures needed 
for victory, the chances of a 
contested convention contin-
ue to increase, no doubt a ter-
rible prospect for the eventual 
Republican nominee.
A number of forces con-
tributed to Cruz’s victory. 
Cruz received the endorse-
ment of Wisconsin Governor 
Scott Walker, popular among 
conservatives for limiting the 
collective bargaining power 
of public employees. Though 
Walker’s own presidential 
aspirations ended before the 
?rst votes were cast, he has op-
posed Trump’s rise to promi-
nence in Republican politics.
A number of conservative 
radio hosts also sided with 
Cruz in retaliation against 
Trump. When Trump called 
into Charlie Sykes’ show, 
Sykes criticized him harshly 
for recent actions. Other radio 
hosts also urged listeners to 
turn away from Trump.
The anti-Trump actions 
in Wisconsin seem to have 
worked. More than a third 
of Republicans in exit poll-
ing said they were scared of 
a Trump presidency, and an-
other ?fth voiced concern. 
Cruz, however, is by no means 
a great ?t for all Republican 
voters. About a quarter of GOP 
voters indicated they would ei-
ther vote for former secretary 
of state Hillary Clinton or a 
third party candidate if either 
Trump or Cruz get top billing 
on the Republican ticket.
Trump was incensed by 
Cruz’s victory. In a statement 
released on Tuesday night, the 
Trump campaign called Cruz 
“worse than a puppet — he is 
a Trojan horse, being used by 
the party bosses attempting to 
steal the nomination from Mr. 
Trump.” Trump alleged that 
Cruz was coordinating with 
his super PACs, continuing al-
legations on Cruz’s integrity 
which have not stopped since 
the campaign’s tactics to si-
phon votes from supporters of 
retired neurosurgeon Ben Car-
son in the Iowa caucus.
In response, Jason Miller, 
a senior adviser to the Cruz 
campaign, stated that “Trump 
has a real problem when he 
gets his tail kicked.” Miller did 
not mention the allegation of 
coordinating with super PACs.
Trump will likely rebound 
in New York’s April 19 con-
test, where 95 delegates are 
up for grabs. The current Real 
Clear Politics average has 
him at over 50 percent of the 
vote. It’s April 26 that could 
decisively determine whether 
the Republicans will duke it 
out into the summer. Con-
necticut, Delaware, Maryland, 
Pennsylvania, and Rhode Is-
land all vote on that day. The 
Real Clear Politics average in 
Pennsylvania has Trump with 
a 13.4 percentage point edge 
over Cruz and a 14.4 percent-
age point lead over Kasich. 
In Maryland, Trump has a 13 
point lead over Cruz and a 14 
point lead over Kasich. With 
sparse polling in the other 
states indicating support for 
Trump, it could be the knock-
out blow Trump needs to se-
cure the nomination. On the 
other hand, the states could 
turn against the frontrunner 
and further prolong the race, 
potentially denying any candi-
date the chance to secure the 
nomination.

The Tartan has dedicated signi?-
cant space to the political process 
this year, for both national elections 
and the student body ones occurring 
here at Carnegie Mellon. However, 
while we often talk about the effect of 
policy, we rarely talk about what the 
responsibilities of an elected of?cial 
are and how they affect the campus 
community.
Elected student of?cials have two 
obligations: to follow Student Gov-
ernment’s rules and to advocate for 
the student body that elected them.
The ?rst obligation to the bylaws 
serves three purposes. The ?rst is 
that this is an important check on the 
bylaws and constitutional require-
ments of the Student Government. 
By following its own rules, student 
government representatives can un-
derstand the burdens and costs these 
rules place on other students. This 
asymmetry created when they do not 
follow the rules makes it harder for 
Student Government to advocate for 
students and for students to trust the 
government’s actions. 
The second is that organizations 
deserve predictability and consisten-
cy, which they look to Student Gov-
ernment to provide. When of?cials 
violate their own bylaws, it has the 
potential to burden students’ organi-
zations with unexpected consequenc-
es, and it becomes harder for them 
to ful?ll their purposes. The third is 
that, should Student Government of-
?cials violate bylaws, it constitutes an 
argument from the government itself 
that the law needs exceptions. This 
means the government ought to look 
into changing the rule entirely rather 
than just breaking it. Otherwise, the 
rule loses authority.
Student government of?cials are 
also obligated to advocate for the stu-
dent body with the power afforded 
to them in the Constitution and by-
laws. Of?cials are put in power with 
students’ votes, meaning students’ 
interests should be the goal of the 
government. When Student Govern-
ment of?cials fail to advocate for 
students, they reject the nature of 
their own job.
Yet democracy is not a one-way 
street. The student body also has two 
duties. The ?rst is to be well informed, 
active participants in the voting pro-
cess. With student government elec-
tions just wrapping up, this obliga-
tion has recently been center stage.
A second, less frequently dis-
cussed piece of the process is our 
responsibility to hold student govern-
ment accountable throughout their 
term. As we look towards the future, 
it seems like an important time to 
look back at an example of why these 
obligations are important and how to 
give students recourse.
The ?rst time most organizations 
heard about the 2016 Student Orga-
nization Summit (herein referred to 
as Summit, not to be confused with 
CMU Summit, an event hosted by 
the Chinese Student Scholar Asso-
ciation) was through an email that 
threatened de-recognition for the or-
ganization should they fail to attend. 
The Committee on Student Organiza-
tion (CoSO) Bylaws state that “CoSO 
is expected to accept applications for 
re-recognition from groups whose 
complete and accurate application 
demonstrates a continuing pursuit 
of their stated primary purpose,” and 
make no mention of an event like 
Summit in the de?nition of a com-
plete and accurate application. Al-
though the bylaws seem to make it so 
that Summit could not be grounds for 
derecognition, many students were 
not familiar with the bylaws and took 
this threat seriously, resulting in con-
fusion and panic among those dedi-
cated to the organizations. Students 
who were not free on Valentine’s Day, 
did not expect this threat, missed the 
email, or plenty of other occurrences 
that were not their fault suddenly felt 
their organizations were on the chop-
ping block.
While student organization lead-
ers may not know the bylaws and in-
ner workings of CoSO, were taught  
about the re-recognition proccess by 
their predecessors. A drastic change 
to the process needs to be handled 
carefully because it can cause dif?cul-
ty for an organization, and confusion 
that would hurt the organization’s 
ability to pursue their goals.
Many organizations were greatly 
confused by the transition surround-
ing Summit. Beyond the turmoil sur-
rounding the derecognition threat, 
there was confusion about whether 
Summit was in addition to the re-
recognition process as per usual 
or whether it replaced the process 
entirely and about who the change 
applied to. Traditionally the re-rec-
ognition process for mature organi-
zations, which are organizations that 
have been on campus for seven years 
or more, is separate from the process 
for young organizations due to their 
different needs. Summit lumped cer-
tain young organizations who were 
working through the standard proce-
dure but had not yet ?nished getting 
re-recognized in with a subset of ma-
ture organizations.
This situation becomes more 
troubling when one realizes that, as 
explained by a source within CoSO, 
“much of the reason [young organiza-
tions] weren’t re-recognized during 
the fall was because CoSO wasn’t do-
ing it’s job properly. They weren’t ?n-
ishing up. They weren’t meeting with 
these organizations properly and 
weren’t discussing these organiza-
tions in a timely manner.” This ended 
up applying inconsistent standards to 
young organizations applying for re-
recognition based on whether CoSO 
managed to have time for them in the 
fall or not, and punishing organiza-
tions who got lost in the process with 
a sudden move for things that were 
not their fault.
In the end no one was derecog-
nized for their inability to attend 
Summit, which indicates that the 
threat was empty to begin with. This 
means the letter of the bylaws was 
not directly violated, but the spirit of 
them was and it is quite possible that 
the trust of organizations was. They 
were threatened with a serious pun-
ishment for failing to do something 
not central to their purpose on cam-
pus. This is not fair to those organi-
zations and certainly not advocating 
for them.
In addition, while no one was de-
recognized, organizations were put 
on probation for failing to attend the 
event on Feb. 14. Probation can cause 
signi?cant inconveniences for orga-
nizations based on the consequences 
assigned by CoSO and, more simply, 
can scare and confuse an organiza-
tion. When their organizational ef-
forts are focused on ?guring out why 
they were on probation, this can take 
time and resources away from an or-
ganization’s function.
The other problem with probation 
is that the burdens on organizations 
to avoid it are well-de?ned. Accord-
ing to the CoSO Bylaws Article VII, 
Section B, “Criteria for Recognition 
Probation include 1. Repeated and/
or egregious failure to meet the ex-
pectations placed on Student Gov-
ernment Recognized organizations, 
as described in the Carnegie Mellon 
University Student Body Constitution 
(herein referred to as the Constitu-
tion); 2. Decrease in membership to 
less than eight (8) members of the 
student body.” Those responsibilities, 
according to Article VI Section D the 
Student Body Constitution include a 
requirement to “1. Notify [CoSO] re-
garding any change in name, mission, 
or purpose; 2. Notify [CoSO] regard-
ing any change in contact informa-
tion for of?cers of the organization; 
3. Pursuit of the organization’s pri-
mary purpose and goals, in the form 
on record with the Committee on Stu-
dent Organizations; 4. Adherence to 
[the bylaws and constitution of Stu-
dent Government, the university, and 
the organization].”
These are the ground rules and 
expectations that have been laid be-
tween Student Government and or-
ganizational of?cers. Violating these 
expectations by placing burdens on 
them outside of this scope is both a 
failure of Student Government to fol-
low its own rules and harmful to the 
organizations.
Of course, the Constitution is a liv-
ing document that can be amended 
if a branch of Student Government 
wishes to change its policies. This 
process, however, is intentionally 
structured to ameliorate the issues 
stemming from a big change, many 
of which are described above. No 
amendment was passed.
Summit is only one example of an 
issue the Student Government and 
student body need to have a dialogue 
about. With elections wrapping up, 
the vast majority of the voting that 
will happen already has. However, 
going forward, the next Student Gov-
ernment has important consider-
ations to make regarding how to keep 
itself accountable to its bylaws and 
responsibilities.
The ?rst is ?scal transparency of 
Student Government actions. This 
makes it easier for students to see 
how Student Government money is 
used. This will both improve campus 
knowledge of various funding sourc-
es and what they are used for and cre-
ate accountability for Student Gov-
ernment of?cials to use their funds 
within the scope of the existing rules.
The second is better avenues of 
protest through governing bodies 
like Student Senate and the Gradu-
ate Student Assembly. Organizations 
should have been able to challenge 
the derecognition threat or proba-
tionary period in regards to Summit, 
and they should also be able to chal-
lenge actions by the Student Gov-
ernment they feel to be wrong as a 
whole. 
Senate and GSA are representative 
bodies and have knowledge of how 
Student Government processes work, 
making them a good check on the ac-
tions of the Student Government Ex-
ecutive Branch.
With these and perhaps other new 
measures in place the student body 
will have the resources it needs to up-
hold its end of the bargain.

CMU students must open conversation with Student Government regarding accountability
Fence speech ought not be silenced by mob mentalities

For those of you night owls on 
campus, on the morning of Monday, 
April 4, the fraction of campus that 
goes to their 8:30 a.m. classes woke 
up to ?nd the touching memorial 
for our recently deceased fellow stu-
dents replaced by the slogan “Make 
America Great Again.” 
By 1:30 p.m. that same afternoon, 
things got even more confusing when 
all that was left of the message was 
the red background and splotches of 
white paint just managing to make 
the original message indecipherable. 
It was at this time that the Facebook 
group Overheard at Carnegie Mel-
lon exploded with before and after 
pictures of The Fence and escalating 
debate over the legality and morality 
of what happened.
First, to address the accusations of 
vandalism against whoever painted 
The Fence in broad daylight, the only 
regulation I was able to ?nd related 
to painting The Fence prohibits the 
use of spraypaint, air-brushes, paint 
rollers and similar tools. Using these 
to paint The Fence is an act of graf?ti. 
All the other stipulations however, 
such as only being able to paint be-
tween midnight and 6 a.m. and hav-
ing to completely cover the previous 
message, seem to just be traditions. 
So far, there doesn’t seem to be a 
problem.
Now however, we get to the more 
charged part of the debate. Was 
painting The Fence in support of 
Donald Trump inappropriate? Was 
this worth breaking our traditions 
for? As usual, there were heated ar-
guments on both sides, some ratio-
nal, some less so. What the situation 
ultimately boils down to is your right 
to voice your political opinion. The 
fence didn’t have any hate speech on 
it. There was no sexist, racist, homo-
phobic, or otherwise inappropriate 
content on The Fence. 
There was only a political slogan, 
of the front runner for the 2016 Re-
publican Presidential Nomination 
might I add. Whether you like the 
policies he advocates, or you person-
ally get offended by what he stands 
for, that’s a value judgement that 
you’re making. What gets me is the 
blatant hypocrisy of the situation: 
less than two days after the student 
body erupts on Overheard, we wel-
come Hillary Clinton, another Presi-
dential candidate, to our campus 
with great pomp and celebration.
The problem with breaking our 
traditions for this scenario is the mes-
sage it sends. It shows that we, as a 
campus, will do whatever it takes to 
silence the voices of those who op-
pose what we decide as the accept-
able opinion. 
As a university that prides itself 
in its diversity, I would hope that 
we’re capable of seeing and accept-
ing, though not necessarily agreeing 
with, differing perspectives. There 
is a frightening trend on college 
campuses around the country these 
days that is pruning the students’ 
right to free speech almost to the 
point of nonexistence. The Spotlight 
on Speech Codes 2016 survey found 
that 49.3 percent of the 440 institu-
tions of higher education surveyed 
have “at least one policy both clearly 
and substantially restricting freedom 
of speech, or that bars public access 
to its speech-related policies,” while 
Carnegie Mellon is one of the mere 
22 universities found to not have any 
policies threatening campus expres-
sion. I for one, would like to keep 
it that way. Personally, the idea of 
dissident opinions being eradicated 
makes me feel a lot more unsafe than 
Donald Trump’s slogan, especially 
since my right to have a dissident 
opinion is what allows me to vote 
against him in the ?rst place.
Something that was much more 
troubling, though not as talked 
about, was how the Trump propa-
ganda covered up the memorial to 
our recently deceased fellow stu-
dents. Painting over The Fence after 
a mere two days with any message 
whatsoever is quite a callous gesture. 
However, The Fence is meant to be 
painted over, and callousness should 
not be mistaken for bigotry.
And ?nally, I’d like to remind ev-
eryone that this entire uproar was 
about a fence with a lot of paint on it.

Last Sunday, April 3, a trail de-
railment in Philadelphia killed two 
construction workers and injured 
thirty-?ve people. 
Just a month ago, a train derail-
ment in Kansas injured thirty-two. 
In 2015, another Philadelphia 
derailment killed eight 
and injured over 
two hundred, the 
deadliest train 
accident in the 
region in nearly 
thirty years.
Let’s face it: 
America has a trans-
portation infrastructure 
problem, and it’s getting costly and 
dangerous. 
Once known for our innovative, 
state-of-the-art highways and rail-
ways, our country now lags behind 
much of the rest of the industrial-
ized world when it comes to pub-
lic investments in transportation. 
We’re losing money, and lives, be-
cause we lack the collective will 
to tackle our infrastructure head-
on with meaningful and decisive 
action.
While many advanced nations 
are pushing to update their infra-
structure, the United States is fall-
ing behind. In less than a decade, 
the United States fell from 7th in 
the World Economic Forum’s rank-
ings of international road quality to 
18th. 
When considering infrastruc-
ture holistically, the World Eco-
nomic Forum ranks the United 
States even worse: 25th. China 
ranked lower, yet it is moving up, 
while the United States continues 
to fall down. China spends 9 per-
cent of its GDP on improving infra-
structure compared to the 2.4 per-
cent of GDP that the United States 
spends for that purpose.
This lack of public investment 
is re?ected by sobering statistics. 
65 percent of American roads are 
in poor condition, and 25 percent 
of America’s bridges urgently re-
quire repair or handle more traf?c 
than they were designed to handle. 
Here in the City of Bridges, 20 per-
cent of our bridges are structurally 
de?cient, including the all-power-
ful Liberty Bridge. 
The United States ranks 18th 
in the world for the quality of our 
railroads and just 30th in the world 
for the quality of our air transport. 
Meanwhile, nearly half of Ameri-
cans lack stable access to any tran-
sit at all.
Having such poor infrastruc-
ture has ?scal and physical con-
sequences. Americans spend 5.5 
billion hours in traf?c every year, 
resulting in hundreds of billions 
of dollars in lost 
productivity and increased 
fuel costs. In 2020, the American 
Society of Civil Engineers estimates 
that poor infrastructure will cost 
$1 trillion in business sales, endan-
gering 3.5 million jobs and costing 
the GDP $3.1 trillion between 2012 
and 2020. Historically, huge public 
investments in infrastructure, such 
as the transcontinental railroad 
and the Interstate Highway System, 
have corresponded with periods of 
unbridled economic growth and 
productivity. In our current case the 
converse is true: failing to invest in 
infrastructure has suffocated our 
economy.
More importantly, the New York 
Times estimates that more than 
14,000 transportation deaths are 
caused by poor infrastructure every 
year. 
Train derailments are a perfect 
example. Many derailment deaths, 
including the deaths in both of the 
above Philadelphia derailments, 
could have been prevented had 
those railroads been retro?tted 
with a technology called Positive 
Train Control. 
It is a moral failing to allow so 
many transportation-related deaths 
that could be prevented by greater 
investments in infrastructure.
It’s time to get over our infra-
structure problem by committing 
to a massive infrastructure spend-
ing program over the next decade. 
It’s time to bid farewell to train 
derailments and traf?c jams, and 
time to greet a new American cen-
tury marked by the innovation, 
economic growth, and security that 
enhanced infrastructure can help 
provide.

Tiny barriers make or break recovery
JOSHUA BROWN
SciTech Editor
Over the past few weeks, mental 
health issues have risen to the fore-
front of many of our conversations, 
and rightfully so. College is perhaps 
the most stressful and change-inten-
sive time that any of us have experi-
enced thus far. Given that we’re all 
making some generally life-de?ning 
choices so early on in our adult lives, 
there’s bound to be some excitement 
for the future, but also some fear. 
We’re afraid that we won’t get good 
grades, which means we won’t get an 
internship, won’t get a job, and we’ll 
all die penniless and alone, begging 
on a dingy little street corner in Ohio 
somewhere. With so much to juggle 
and so little time in the day, we’re 
bound to be stressed and maybe a 
little exhausted. Exhaustion and per-
ceived stress are two susceptibility 
factors in burnout, which can lead 
to depression and feelings of being 
overtired and overwhelmed. With so 
much of our self-worth often tied to 
external things like our workload or 
our general success, we can often fall 
into a slump when we don’t meet the 
standards set before us, and we begin 
to feel like all of the work we have 
been putting forth just isn’t enough 
or isn’t worth continuing. This is a 
burnt-out state: we lack energy, lack 
motivation, and this feeling can spi-
ral into depression before we know 
what hit us. And when these sort of 
personal issues arise, it can be very 
dif?cult to reach out and ask for help, 
or even to talk with someone.
The causes of depression and sim-
ilar disorders are myriad, but in col-
lege, some of the largest factors are 
our perceived success (how often do 
I succeed at something I try?), our 
social support (do I have people 
I can talk to who will support 
me?), and our sense of belong-
ing (is this the place for me, or 
am I just taking up space?). 
Without these things, we can 
start to feel isolated and devel-
op a cycle of negative thoughts 
and neurotic reactions that 
can spiral out of control. This 
was the case with my own 
experience during the 
spring of 2015.
Long story short, I 
needed some help. 
I’ve never been the 
kind of person to 
ask for help, at 
least when it comes 
to personal matters, but 
one fateful day I summoned 
up enough energy to meander 
over to Morewood and try my luck 
with CaPS. Lo and behold, the big 
metal door was locked (during busi-
ness hours), and while there may 
have been another entrance of which 
I was unaware, that was enough for 
me. I packed up my help-seeking and 
curled up in bed.
The point here isn’t that the door 
was locked (for some unknown rea-
son). It’s that I had ?nally mustered 
up the energy and the wherewithal 
to try and talk to someone, to try and 
?ght whatever cycle I was in, and was 
met with a roadblock. One symp-
tom of depression is a lack of energy 
and motivation; the sheer amount 
of energy it takes to be able to say 
“I’m going to actively try and ?ght 
this today” is extraordinary in such 
a state, and to have those efforts be 
thwarted, even by something as silly 
as a door, can be devastating to that 
initiative.
This anecdote of the closed door 
can be extrapolated to many situa-
tions of which I’ve recently become 
aware. While there are many other 
factors which might preclude one 
from getting the help they need, I’ll 
focus on a resource speci?cally cre-
ated for assisting with students’ psy-
chological needs: Carnegie Mellon’s 
Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices (CaPS).
I have heard many stories about 
CaPS. As a Resident Assistant (RA), 
I was taught during Orientation that 
CaPS is a resource for students, and 
that if anyone is having a problem, 
CaPS can be depended upon to as-
sist. And yes, I have certainly spo-
ken to those who have seen success 
in dealing with CaPS. But an over-
whelming vibe I am picking up, at 
least in my own friends’ experience, 
is that CaPS has some major strides to 
make before it can really be called a 
dependable resource for our student 
population.
Barring my own personal experi-
ence (or lack thereof), I have a friend 
who called CaPS in the early morning 
while having a panic 
attack, and the ?rst 
response with which she was 
met was “Is this an emergency?” 
Thinking something along the lines 
of “Well, I don’t know, is it? There are 
probably people worse off than me,” 
she hung up and waited out the night. 
I have heard a similar story from sev-
eral other friends and acquaintances, 
and it doesn’t quite sit well with me.
It’s not as if this is a malignant 
question. There’s no malice in asking 
whether or not a situation constitutes 
an emergency, but I think this is a 
blunt way of handling these phone 
calls. It places a lot of self-assessment 
in the hands of someone who might 
be unable to make these sorts of calls 
at the moment, and it provides anoth-
er block in the road to someone’s po-
tential recovery or present wellness.
I’ve also heard stories of CaPS ac-
tively hanging up if the caller answers 
with a “no, this isn’t an emergency,” 
sort of answer. While I understand 
that emergencies should take prior-
ity, and that the on-call staff might 
not nearly meet the present need, it’s 
rather cruel for the campus’s counsel-
ing service to actively ignore students 
who have taken the time to seek out 
help.
I suppose the point of all this isn’t 
necessarily to be pejorative towards 
CaPS. It’s to express frustration for 
the hurdles (however small and 
melodramatic) through which we 
must jump to ?nd help. My personal 
opinion is that mental health issues 
aren’t something that can necessarily 
be solved or even heavily ameliorated 
administratively. A lot of these less 
severe, more ?eeting issues (like my 
depression) can be successfully man-
aged by just speaking with friends 
or having friends or doing friendly 
things, and having the social struc-
tures in place to really feel close to 
someone. In our day-to-day lives, we 
might think about ourselves more 
than others, or only our close friends. 
It’s surprising what an open hand or 
a little conversation can do for some-
one’s day, so I would encourage any 
reader to be an open hand rather 
than a closed door. Don’t concern 
yourselves only with emergencies; 
it’s that kind of thing that 
often pushes people to-
ward rash action. Reach 
out during the week, 
when you don’t have any reason to be 
concerned. Be sincere when you ask 
“how are you,” and have time to lis-
ten to a real answer. Grow your ears 
and shrink your mouth, and be there 
for someone when neither of you may 
know how necessary your presence 
is.

American infrastructure trainwreck demands aid 
As my ?rst year here at Carnegie 
Mellon rapidly approaches its culmi-
nation, I would like to comment on the 
culture and support network that is 
being so hotly discussed around cam-
pus. As a person with a military back-
ground, I know the stress of combat, 
impossible deadlines, and true life-
and-death decisions. Carnegie Mellon 
does not ask for any of those, yet I am 
more stressed and demoralized about 
my own capabilities than ever before. 
I didn’t want to believe that it could 
affect me because I thought it was 
simply a product of young undergrads 
with little real-life experience. I was 
wrong.
The graduate student community 
is being overlooked in many ways, 
with the vast majority of the focus 
placed on undergraduates. Provost 
Jahanian’s email today (April 1) states 
that “it is clear” that faculty “under-
stand the pressures many of you face.” 
I have leaned on my advisor and many 
other professors and students and all 
have offered signi?cant support. Yet 
in the classroom it is a different story. 
There is a belief that as a graduate 
student you are not entitled to breaks, 
expected to be overloaded, and even 
to fail. Days after an exam where the 
entire class questioned why we were 
at this university, the professor pro-
ceeded to say that he expected the 
highest grade to be a 50. Another said 
“graduate students don’t get days off” 
and held class on a day the university 
calendar marked for no classes. An-
other assigned a project with no warn-
ing before Spring Break, with manda-
tory submissions during the break. 
Heinz College doesn’t even follow the 
larger university calendar. Advisors 
actively tell you not to do homework 
and focus on research. There are few 
resources for those who have children 
and spouses.
I say this not to complain, but 
rather to inform. Professors must ac-
knowledge that the guidelines estab-
lished by the university are clear on 
the expectations. A 12-unit course is 
supposed to require 12 hours of work 
per week, to include class time, recita-
tion, and assignments — not 30. The 
best way to mitigate the issues of stu-
dents is to realize that nobody wins 
when students give up on trying be-
cause they have no more time or en-
ergy to put towards the assignment. 
Saying “the rules don’t apply because 
you’re in a graduate program,” or, 
“you should be able to deal with that 
on your own” do not fall under the 
support concept the administration 
is seeking. Change starts at the class-
room level.

Over the past few days, a change.
org petition for “Zero Tolerance for 
Sexual Assault at Carnegie Mel-
lon University” has been circulating 
through social media. People have 
shared it on Facebook pages, cam-
paigned for it in line for the Hillary 
Clinton rally, and asked admitted 
students to sign it.
During my time at Carnegie Mel-
lon, I’ve transformed Carnegie Mel-
lon’s feminist organization, MORF, 
turning it from a group of three 
freshmen to what it is today, a club 
that raised thousands of dollars for 
reproductive rights at The Vagina 
Monologues and brought the campus 
together for sexual education at Love 
Female Orgasm. I have always been 
an advocate for survivors, but that is 
not why I’m writing today. I’m writ-
ing because I did some thinking, and 
I do not support this petition.
The writers of this petition are 
correct in that Carnegie Mellon has 
a huge sexual assault problem. Our 
numbers are signi?cantly above the 
national average and that needs to be 
addressed via serious policy change. 
This petition proposes one solution 
that I’ve been told I should agree 
with, but I can’t endorse.
The petition as it currently stands 
requires mandatory expulsion for 
any student found responsible for 
sexual assault via the University 
Disciplinary Committee. Carnegie 
Mellon’s de?nition of sexual assault 
is consistent: “any physical sexual 
act perpetrated against a person’s 
will, where that person does not 
give clear and voluntary consent, or 
where that person is incapable of giv-
ing consent.” Any physical sexual act 
perpetrated against a person’s will 
includes grabbing someone’s butt at 
a party, or kissing them before ask-
ing. Sexual assault also includes situ-
ations where one or both parties are 
intoxicated.
Mandatory expulsion would be 
harsher than any other university 
policy. The closest comparison is 
Dartmouth College’s policy, which 
mandates expulsion only in speci?c 
cases such as repeat and violent 
offenses. The proposal, much broad-
er than Dartmouth’s, would force the 
Disciplinary Committee to act as an 
expulsion committee, rather than 
one that decides a consequence ap-
propriate for each individual case. 
This does not mean that the Univer-
sity should not expel rapists — in fact, 
it regularly does. But it also decides 
what to do in cases that are not so 
clear-cut. What if we had clearly de-
lineated consequences so that survi-
vors had a strong grasp of what was 
a likely outcome? Consequences like 
mandatory counseling, community 
service, suspension, and removal 
from campus housing could all be 
publicly known consequences that 
a survivor might select and recom-
mend to a Disciplinary Committee.
Some might think the only reason 
survivors go to the University Disci-
plinary Committee is in dire situa-
tions. I ?nd that argument odd. The 
Disciplinary Committee is an oppor-
tunity to arrive at a formal, rather 
than informal, decision over a viola-
tion of our sexual assault policy, and 
is often a reasonable way to address 
a dispute in a controlled setting. 
Students choose to go through the 
formal process for sexual assault for 
many reasons, and not all of them 
warrant mandatory expulsion.
The other two aspects of the peti-
tion — Transparency and Education 
— are initiatives that the Title IX Of-
?ce has not only already agreed to, 
but has been working on for some 
time. They’ve made it clear that 
both of these points are part of their 
initiatives moving forward. More 
transparency about the actual con-
sequence determination processes, 
both formal and informal, is neces-
sary moving forward, but has not 
been addressed by the Title IX Of-
?ce or this petition. I hope that the 
discussion surrounding this petition 
leads to a broader knowledge of the 
operations of the Title IX Of?ce, rath-
er than a dismissal of it as ineffective.
Carnegie Mellon has a sexual as-
sault problem. But mandatory expul-
sion for anyone who commits sexual 
assault isn’t the solution. Hopefully, 
discussion of this petition will bring 
up other policies that we can take 
away from Dartmouth College’s more 
rigorous sexual assault prevention 
strategy, including an online report-
ing option, mandatory expulsion in 
serious cases, and clear delineation 
of consequences for speci?c viola-
tions. The people who wrote this pe-
tition clearly care about survivors of 
sexual assault. But in their empathy, 
they lose sight of the fact that not all 
situations are black and white. I en-
courage readers to consider whether 
this policy and this document are 
worth supporting.
We’ve been given a great opportu-
nity by the writers of “Zero Tolerance 
for Sexual Assault at Carnegie Mel-
lon University.” In the wake of the 
Title IX investigations our University 
has faced, we now have the opportu-
nity to use both our hearts and minds 
to make policy decisions about its fu-
ture. Let’s make the right ones.

This past month in an ear-
ly release to Nature, the lab 
of Dr. Ali Güler at University 
of Virginia demonstrated the 
ability to remotely control 
the activity of specific neu-
ral circuits using magnetic 
fields at a distance. 
This discovery is the 
newest in a line of method 
research in the field of neu-
roscience that is rapidly 
approaching the concept 
of being able to specifi-
cally target certain cells 
and generate a spe-
cific behavioral or 
phenomenologi-
cal experience; 
one might say 
“mind control.” 
At first, the idea 
of scientists being able 
to control someone 
else’s behavior rap-
idly and non-inva-
sively may seem 
terrifying, this 
new method 
is not that 
much more 
dystopian 
than the 
myriad of 
modern 
methods of 
neural mind 
control to which we have 
access today.
Let’s first take a few steps 
back. Only a little more than 
10 years ago, the best meth-
ods available were electrical 
patch clamp stimulation and 
psychopharmacology. Elec-
trical patch clamp stimu-
lation targeted a specific 
area of the brain, but was 
not specified to a specific 
type of neuron; this means 
that researchers were un-
able to stimulate at a 
fine resolution. Psy-
chopharmacological 
methods were able 
to target a specific 
system of neurons 
that all expressed 
the same recep-
tors, but was 
not specified 
to an exact 
region of the 
brain. These 
were the methods that have 
been used in neuroscience 
for most of the 20th century 
and while many researchers 
were able to make significant 
advances using them, 
these limitations still posed 
significant issues. 
These are the methods 
that have been used both in 
research and clinically for 
much of neuroscience’s his-
tory. We have a slew of medi-
cations that are designed 
to interact with 
individual re-
ceptors in 
the brain, 
but these can 
have drastic side 
effects due to their lack of lo-
cation specificity. According 
to Carnegie Mellon Assistant 
Teaching Professor in the 
Department of Biological 
Sciences,  Daniel J. Brasier, 
“the manipulations we’re 
talking about now [magne-
togenetics] are less scary 
because they are only going 
to affect very particular tar-
geted area of the brain; for 
example, antipsychotic med-
ications for schizophrenia 
block dopamine. In separate 
parts of the brain, dopamine 
is necessary for movement; 
people can take anti-psy-
chotic drugs and devel-
op Parkinson-like 
symptoms.”  In 
order to address 
these problems 
of specificity in 
location and cell 
type, scientists turned 
to genetic modifica-
tions to provide 
the necessary 
targeting 
abilities. 
Research-
ers intro-
duce a 
viral vec-
tor that 
interacts 
with a spe-
cific neuron 
type and induces 
the production 
of a Channelrho-
dopsin protein. 
This protein, 
when stimu-
lated by light, 
causes an influx 
of positively 
charged ions, paralleling the 
functioning of indigenous re-
ceptors when activating the 
cell. Through this method, 
fiber optic cables can be im-
planted in the target regions 
of the brain being studied 
and then this specific subset 
of cells can be activated by 
turning on the light. 
By this technique 
scientists are able to uncov-
er what effect on behavior 
or “thought” the activation 
of this specific set of cells

“Am I a slave to my dead-
lines,” and “what does it 
mean to be alive” might rank 
rather high in one’s list of ex-
istential crises. 
After a sleepless night of 
homeworking and battling 
the raging desire to sleep, 
or to do anything other than 
that sadistically long prob-
lem set, one might ask herself 
“Do I control my own life?” 
These questions are not 
relegated only to sleep-
deprived college students’ 
early morning musings; 
they’ve been at the center 
of many intellectual debates 
over the past 600 years. A 
generation’s opinions about 
these questions are represen-
tative of their beliefs about 
the past and their expecta-
tions from the future. 
This timeless fascination 
with the question of what it 
means to be living has been 
explored most recently be 
Jessica Riskin, a history pro-
fessor at Stanford Univer-
sity. In her latest book, The 
Restless Clock, she moves 
past the previous theologi-
cally and philosophically 
grounded discussions and 
looks at these questions of 
autonomy through the lens 
of a historian. 
Riskin’s work explores the 
de?nition of an “automaton,” 
or a human-like machine, as 
well as several theories sur-
rounding the mechanism of 
life.  The idea of mechani-
cally creating another “hu-
man” is an intriguing one. 
This idea was ?rst explored 
within a theological context. 
In the 15th century, au-
tomatons were often used 
to depict biblical scenes and 
dazzle the audience with the 
power of life-like presenta-
tions, convince them of the 
terror of devils, the holiness 
of angels and the “reality” of 
the Nativity scene. 
Churches would often use 
mechanically operated (usu-
ally using pulleys) devils, an-
gels, saints and other ?gures 
from the bible. These autom-
atons would be used to put

New material turns water to steam without boiling
Researchers have created 
an extremely black material 
that can turn water to steam 
without boiling. The mate-
rial, a deep black color that 
re?ects little visible light, 
is made up of “nanopores,” 
gold nanoparticles af?xed to 
a scaffold pocked with tiny 
channels. On April 8, the 
researchers reported in Sci-
ence Advances that the mate-
rial is 99 percent ef?cient at 
absorbing light in the visible 
spectrum and parts of the in-
frared spectrum.
The material ?oats on 
the surface of water due to 
its high porosity, allowing 
it to naturally soak up sun-
light. The electrons on the 
surface of a gold nanopar-
ticle in the nanopore are 
excited when hit with a 
certain wavelength of light, 
and they oscillate back and 
forth. These oscillations, 
known as plasmons, create 
localized heating, which va-
porizes the water nearby.

Fresh fruit intake reduces risk of adult heart attacks
 According to new re-
search published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine, 
people who eat fresh fruit 
daily are at a lower risk of 
heart attack and stroke than 
people who do not. 
Researchers from the 
University of Oxford and the 
Chinese Academy of Medical 
Sciences conducted a survey 
of half a million adults in ur-
ban and rural areas of China 
who had no prior cardiovas-
cular diseases or anti-hyper-
tensive treatments.
The researchers moni-
tored fruit intake (mainly 
apples or oranges) and 
health for seven years. The 
study found that fruit intake 
was strongly associated with 
other factors, such as educa-
tion, lower blood glucose, 
lower blood pressure, and 
not smoking. The study also 
found that fruit intake alone 
was associated with about 
one-third less cardiovascu-
lar mortality in both men 
and women from different 
areas of China.

Curiosity shown to be masochistic biological drive
New research pub-
lished in Psychological Sci-
ence shows that people will 
choose potentially painful 
outcomes with no obvious 
bene?ts just to satisfy their 
curiosity. 
“Just as curiosity drove 
Pandora to open the box 
despite being warned of its 
pernicious contents, curios-
ity can lure humans  — like 
you and me — to seek infor-
mation with predictably om-
inous consequences,” said 
study author Bowen Ruan 
of the Wisconsin School of 
Business at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison.
Researchers designed a 
series of experiments to test 
the hypothesis that people 
are willing to resolve un-
certainty even if it brings 
them pain. In one study, 
54 college students were 
given various types of pens 
that deliver electric shocks 
when clicked. Participants 
who were unsure of whether 
the pen would give an elec-
tric shock were more likely 
to click the pen to ?nd out 
than participants who knew 
prior.

Record-setting supermassive black hole discovered
 The discovery of a near-
record supermassive black 
hole in a local galaxy has 
prompted researchers to 
think that supermassive 
black holes may be more 
common than originally 
thought, according to Uni-
versity of California, Berke-
ley astronomers. 
The supermassive black 
hole is around the size of 17 
billion suns, and located in a 
galaxy known as NCG 1600.
Images taken by the Hubble 
Space Telescope reveal that 
the center of NGC 1600 is 
unusually faint, indicating 
a lack of stars close to the 
black hole, meaning that the 
galaxy is, therefore, mas-
sive. The researchers report-
ed the discovery of the black 
hole, located about 200 mil-
lion light-years from Earth 
in the direction of the con-
stellation Eridanus, in the 
April 6 issue of the journal 
Nature.

Chinese farmers help bees, hand-pollinate ?owers
  As a result of the 
worldwide decline in bee 
population, farm work-
ers in Hanyuan county, in 
China’s Sichuan province, 
are pollinating ?owers by 
hand.  The county, known 
as the “world’s pear capi-
tal,” has seen drastic reduc-
tion in fruit crop as a result 
of pesticides reducing bee 
populations.
Farm workers transfer 
pollen from male to female 
?owers to arti?cially fer-
tilize them. Photographer 
Kevin Frayer captured im-
ages of the workers polli-
nating the plants, saying, 
“On the one hand it’s a 
story about the human toll 
on the environment, while 
on the other it shows our 
ability to be more ef?cient 
in spite of it all. It is en-
tirely possible than in our 
lifetime this practice could 
become the norm all over 
the world.” Bees are crucial 
not only to our ecosystems, 
but also to a heavy majority 
of our produce.

SpaceX lands reusable rocket on ocean platform
After four failed at-
tempts, SpaceX has suc-
cessfully landed a reus-
able rocket on an ocean 
platform off the coast of 
Florida. 
The rocket, called Fal-
con 9, was returning to 
Earth after delivering an 
in?atable habitat built by 
Nevada company Bigelow 
Aerospace that will attach 
to the International Space 
Station for a two-year test.
After the cargo was de-
livered, the main-stage 
booster of the rocket sepa-
rated and landed on a ?oat-
ing platform called a drone 
ship. 
“The rocket landed in-
stead of putting a hole in 
the ship — or tipping over 
— so we’re really excited 
about that,” SpaceX found-
er and chief executive Elon 
Musk told reporters in 
Florida. 
This is the ?rst cargo 
run NASA has made with 
SpaceX since their rocket 
exploded after launch in 
June 2015.

Mechanical engineering students create self-?ltering water barrels
JONATHAN CALVELLO 
Staffwriter
Throughout our day, most 
of us probably aren’t worried 
about where we’re going to 
go when we get thirsty: the 
myriad of water fountains 
and soda fountains make 
beverages an easily accessi-
ble commodity. Not all parts 
of the world are fortunate 
enough, however, to have 
such access to clean, ?ltered 
water. In fact, most third-
world countries struggle to 
develop a sustainable supply 
of clean water.
A group of senior mechan-
ical engineering students at 
Carnegie Mellon University 
attempted to solve that prob-
lem by developing a ?ltration 
mechanism that ?lters water 
as it is transported. The ?ltra-
tion consists of a big barrel 
that contains a smaller bar-
rel inside of it, with a handle 
attached for pushing motil-
ity. The concept behind the 
design is that as the barrel is 
rolled along the ground, the 
motion caused by pushing the 
big barrel ?lters the dirt away 
from water and stores the 
puri?ed, clean water in the 
mechanism’s smaller barrel.
“We had already seen 
some ideas out there that ?l-
tered water, and others that 
rolled the water using bar-
rels, but we wanted to create 
something that ?ltered while 
you rolled,” said Deepak Ravi, 
one of the senior mechanical 
engineering students on the 
project, in a University press 
release.
The beauty of this water 
?ltration system is that it ?l-
ters water as it is transported, 
and it is industrially very 
simple in design. The ?ltra-
tion system contains only a 
few simple parts that amount 
to no more than $200 in 
cost, and requires no power 
input other than the physi-
cal pushing of the barrel by 
users during transportation 
of water. The system uses a 
Sawyer water ?lter and relies 
on a process called reverse 
osmosis. The basic design 
behind a reverse-osmosis 
water ?lter is that the ?lter is 
made of a porous substance 
that allows water to ?ow 
through it. Because water is 
in the liquid phase, it is able 
to deform and ?ow through 
the ?lter without any issues; 
any solid particles, however, 
cannot ?t through the pores 
in the ?lter, and instead be-
come trapped in the matter of 
the ?lter. The ef?ciency of a 
reverse-osmosis ?ltration de-
vice is dependent on its pore 
size: the smaller the pores are 
in the ?lter, the more solid 
particles it can trap. The Saw-
yer ?lter in the water barrel 
mechanism ?lters water as 
the barrel is pushed, con-
?ating the issue of ?ltration 
and transportation into one 
solution. 
Other types of water ?l-
tration mechanisms do exist, 
such as ion exchange or acti-
vated carbon. In these ?ltra-
tion devices, water is passed 
through a chemical that ad-
sorbs the dirt and other par-
ticulates that contaminate 
the water. While these types 
of ?lters are popular, they 
can get pricey due to the cost 
of the chemicals required for 
?ltration. 
The advantage of using 
the Sawyer ?lter is that is 
does not need to be replaced, 
making it a one-time pur-
chase that does not need to 
be refurbished over time, 
unlike the activated carbon 
or ion-exchange ?ltration 
mechanisms. Additionally, 
the group used a recycled 
industrial barrel as opposed 
to purchasing a new one to 
cut down on the cost of the 
device. The barrels are usu-
ally thrown away after they 
are used, so this senior proj-
ect ?nds an exceptional appli-
cation for what would other-
wise be considered garbage.
Although this prototype 
was designed as part of a 
graduation requirement, the 
group of seniors is hopeful 
that their design is able to 
grow into something bigger 
than just a class project. 
The group calculated that 
if mass produced, the cost of 
the barrel ?ltration mecha-
nism could be reduced from 
$200 to just $40. The seniors 
are hopeful that they can ?nd 
a company willing to mass 
produce their ?ltration sys-
tem, allowing their design to 
reach thousands of impover-
ished people in developing 
countries. “If someone wants 
to manufacture our system 
and get it down to that $40, 
none of us would be upset,” 
said Anna Mirabella, another 
one of the seniors on the proj-
ect, in a University press re-
lease. “It would be awesome 
to have had a small part of 
something big.”

Last week, Pugwash joined 
forces with the Humanist 
League for a joint discus-
sion about the differences 
between the real and virtual 
worlds. 
It’s possible for people to 
spend the majority of their 
time in a virtual world mak-
ing friends, achieving goals, 
and building a life, all in a 
video game or some other 
form of alternate reality. Are 
these actions somehow lesser 
when compared to their real-
world counterparts? Is there 
a danger involved with the 
virtual world?
One of the very ?rst points 
made was to change the word-
ing of the subject matter. By 
calling our physical world the 
“real” world, and the online 
or technology-driven world 
“virtual,” the language itself 
was already putting the phys-
ical world above the virtual 
one. 
Instead of using real and 
virtual to refer to the distinc-
tion, it was proposed that 
we should refer to them as 
meat-space and cyber-space, 
so as to put them on a more 
linguistically even level. This 
proposal was enthusiastically 
agreed upon by all present.
Along with changing the 
terminology, many argued 
that the line between the 
cyber-wold and the meat-
world isn’t a clear one. It’s 
not a distinct binary when 
you can be sitting in class, lis-
tening to a professor lecture, 
and then glance down and be 
communicating with some-
one across the hall or across 
the world. Even using e-mail 
to talk to people blurs the 
line between the cyber- 
and meat-worlds. This 
is only one reason 
to prefer the meat-
world to the cyber-
world. 
Without devalu-
ing the experiences 
in the cyber-
world, they 
are still based 
in the meat-
world and rely 
on the meat-
world, wheth-
er through 
electricity and 
server-space or 
because as hu-
mans we need 
to take care of 
our physical 
bodies.
Despite 
relying on 
the meat-
world, the 
cyber-world 
can still offer 
meaningful 
experiences. 
It can also of-
fer completely 
pointless 
experiences, 
just like the 
meat-world. 
Playing Flappy 
Bird and playing Portal offer 
different levels of experience 
in the cyber-world, just like 
fast food and a nice restaurant 
do in the meat-world. Social 
interaction is an area over 
which the meat-world has the 
upper hand. Humans com-
municate through so much 
more than just 
words, 
and 
losing out on body language, 
tone, and other meat-world 
features make cyber-world 
interactions somewhat 
lacking. A counterpoint is 
that cyber-world interactions 
could become equal, with ad-
vances in technology. 
From letters to phone calls 
to Skyping, and next to virtual 
reality, technology is making 
the cyber-world more  and 
more immersive. A concern 
with cyber-world interactions 
is their possibility for 
anonymity. Without the social 
cues and accountability that 
come in the meat-world, does 
the cyber-world encourage 
productive debate? On one 
hand, anonymous online 
communities have allowed 
for marginalized groups to 
come together and share in 
interests that might be looked 
down upon in society at large, 
which could be bene?cial. On 
the other, losing out on so-
cial mores and reverting to 
rudeness is a serious con-
cern. An interesting point 
was made that 
humans have 
been using vari-
ous cyber-worlds 
for millennia, 
counting books, 
plays, art, and 
even further 
back to oral 
tradition and 
religions or 
mythologies. 
Escapism is an 
essential part of 
being human, 
biologically 
built into the 
human experi-
ence as dreams. 
Whether 
escaping into a 
book or a video 
game, it’s the 
same root con-
cept. The only 
problem comes 
when it becomes 
dif?cult for the 
escapee to tell 
the difference 
between the cyber-world and 
the meat-world. One example 
was of someone who drove 
into pedestrians, thinking 
they were still playing Grand 
Theft Auto. Problems arise 
when people can’t tell the 
difference between fact and 
?ction, and live in their own 
reality unshared by the rest of 
society. 
Perhaps if everyone were 
able to transition into a cyber-
world and leave the meat-
world behind for good, then it 
would be acceptable, as there 
would still be a shared reality 
within the cyber-world, and 
no transition problems mov-
ing from one to the other. 
However, this brings up 
pragmatic issues that occur 
even in less-extreme scenar-
ios. With two split worlds, 
meat and cyber, a question 
of access arises. Like most 
technology, the rich are able 
to use the cyber-world more 
than the poor, and as we 
come to rely on the cyber-
world for more and more, this 
disparity would become more 
apparent. 
While having inequality 
is not a new thing, moving 
our lives into the cyber-world 
could exacerbate the prob-
lem. Even if all currently fore-
seeable problems could be 
solved, humanity has a way 
of jumping in ?rst and asking 
questions later. 
For example, while we’re 
not particularly well-suit-
ed to drive two-ton killing 
machines at 60 mph, but we 
managed to make do, espe-
cially with seatbelts and other 
later additions. 
Entering into cyber-world 
might be the same way — 
while it might be bumpy, 
eventually we can use it to 
our advantage.

There are many ways by 
which people have claimed to 
expand their consciousness: 
meditation, yoga, sensory de-
privation, even psychedelic 
drugs. But none may be more 
ancient, polarizing, or grue-
some than trepanation.
Trepanation is the process 
of boring a hole into the skull, 
just deeply enough to expose 
the brain’s outermost men-
ingeal layer, the dura mater. 
Over a short period of time, 
the skin will reform over the 
puncture site, but the hole in 
the skull will remain. From 
time immemorial, ancient 
cultures’ medics would drill 
holes into their patients’ 
skulls to cure aberrant behav-
iors or mental illnesses. This 
procedure was thought to al-
low evil spirits to escape the 
affected individual.
Trepanned skulls have 
been unearthed across the 
globe, and perhaps the earli-
est dates back to the 5th Mil-
lennium, B.C., according to 
the National Museum of His-
tory of Azerbaijan. 
However ancient this pro-
cedure, it is not relegated to 
the annals of history. Trepa-
nation is still practiced in 
the modern age in many 
ways. Some still view it as a 
religious ritual. Others, as a 
gateway to transcendence. 
Medical professionals in the 
present-day, however, use a 
milder, temporary form of the 
procedure called a 
craniotomy, for a 
myriad of reasons. 
Craniotomies can 
be used to exam-
ine, diagnose, and 
treat certain dis-
eases like brain 
tumors, to remove 
excess blood in 
the skull, or to 
drain pus-?lled 
abscesses, for ex-
ample. The dif-
ference between a 
craniotomy and a 
trepanation proce-
dure is that in a cra-
niotomy, the piece 
of removed skull is 
set back in place; 
in trepanation, the 
hole remains un-
?lled, covered by 
regrown skin.
While craniot-
omy has superseded full-on 
trepanation within the le-
gitimate medical community, 
there are still niche groups 
who practice trepanation and 
advocate for its induction 
into conventional medicine. 
Individuals such as Amanda 
Feilding, the director of the 
Beckley Foundation and a 
self-trepanned individu-
al, have advocated for the 
procedure as a treatment for 
“chronic headaches, epilepsy, 
and migraines,” as quoted in 
an interview with Vice. There 
also exist organizations 
like the International 
Trepanation Advocacy 
Group (ITAG), who 
continue to push for 
destigmatization and 
acceptance of the pro-
cedure.
Beyond the medical 
community, trepana-
tion saw an interesting 
surge in the 1960-70s 
among those who were 
interested in conscious-
ness and psychedelic 
drugs. During this time 
period, several indi-
viduals involved in 60-
70s drug cultures in-
volving LSD and other 
psychedelics trepanned 
themselves.
Feilding is one such 
individual, as is Joe 
Mellen, who describes 
his experiences with 
auto-trepanation in his book 
Bore Hole. Many of these in-
dividuals were intrigued by 
the idea of expanding their 
minds and augmenting their 
consciousnesses, and ac-
cording to both accounts, 
there may possibly be some 
merit to the assertion that 
trepanation could have some 
physiological or psychologi-
cal bene?ts. In an interview 
with Vice, Feilding spoke of 
a trepanned friend, “I noticed 
a de?nite change in him … 
a mellowing, a lessening of 
the neurotic behavior that 
we all have.” She maintains 
that another of her friends 
“had chronic headaches that 
caused him to lose a day or 
two a week, but he hasn’t had 
those headaches in the last 
30 years [since he was tre-
panned].” 
Feilding describes her own 
post-trepanation experience 
as “a feeling of rising, slowly 
and gently, to levels that felt 
good.” Mellen, in an inter-
view with Vice, described his 
experience as “a lightness, 
like a weight had been lifted 
off [him].”
My main research ques-
tion was to ?gure out wheth-
er or not there are any psy-
chological or physiological 
explanations for these poten-
tial effects — whether pres-
sure in the brain can actually 
inhibit the ?ow of blood or 
cerebrospinal ?uid, thus neg-
atively impact the brain’s per-
formance. In order to do so, 
I examined the role of blood 
and cerebrospinal ?uid in 
the brain, as well as research 
which provides correlations 
to changing circulation of 
both. Findings by professor 
Yuri Moskalenko, head of the 
Cyber-space provides inauthentic analog for real world life

Opening the mind: Trepanation & a culture of transcendence
Historian tackles the question of “what it means to be alive”
up a show that was intended 
to inspire fear and rever-
ence into the audience. Soon 
enough, the public discov-
ered that these contraptions 
were the work of man and not 
of the Divine Providence. 
This led to the public try-
ing to ascribe greater power 
over mankind’s actions to 
God as opposed to God that 
simply reacted to mankind’s 
actions. 
This reimagined God — 
unlike the medieval God — 
had a monopoly over fate and 
like a clockmaker governed 
the workings of his clockwork 
world. This idea of having no 
agency (no control over your 
actions) became popular and 
still is. As the Age of Rea-
son set in, and the Church’s 
authority came to be ques-
tioned by scienti?c minds like 
those of Galileo, Descartes, 
Mersenne, the idea of having 
no agency developed a differ-
ent reasoning. 
Descartes ascribed the 
products of engineering 
such as bellows, hydraulic 
systems, irrigation systems 
and furnaces to biological 
systems. 
Furthermore, he argued 
that such systems were 
driven by external stimuli, 
essentially saying that we 
are completely governed by 
our environments (includ-
ing expression of complex 
emotions like humility, lib-
erality, veneration etc.) This 
Cartesian philosophy used 
the analogy of hydraulic sys-
tems, containing the vital ?u-
id – “animal spirit” to “drive” 
humans.  
This ?uid would behave 
like all other ?uids – it would 
pursue equilibrium, climb 
siphons, ?ow i.e., “have a 
purpose” (?uids are always 
?owing to somewhere). 
Fondly “rationalizing” life 
and agency (or lack thereof), 
Descartes in Riskin’s opinion 
sought to eliminate philoso-
phy and theology from that 
was “obviously scienti?c”. 
No doubt, this brought 
about an epistemologi-
cal revolution (the way 
people think about how 
they think) imbibed with 
the belief that “Machinery 
means Intelligibility” — the 
association of hard data and 
empirical reasoning with in-
tellect.  Unsurprisingly, Des-
cartes was also the ?rst to ex-
plicitly express a “subjective 
sense of selfhood” in his opin-
ions by acknowledging that 
his thoughts made him who 
he was. In response to this ar-
gument, Leibniz introduced 
the idea of a “living force”. 
He differentiated it from 
the Newtonian concept of 
force by saying that motion 
wasn’t a real thing, it was the 
effect of an interaction be-
tween objects. 
This force was “real”, an 
inherent property that be-
longed to the body itself. Both 
of these theories however, 
are incomplete. The “force” 
or “animal spirit” we’re unac-
counted for and do hint at the 
involvement of either human 
will or divine intervention. 
Pointing out these ?aws. 
In 1856 Henry Huxley ob-
served that despite it being 
common knowledge that 
water was formed out of the 
chemical combination of hy-
drogen and oxygen in a 2:1 
ratio, we don’t understand 
“why” water has the proper-
ties it does. 
Yet, we don’t assume 
that there exists something 
called “aquosity” that takes 
possession of it. 
Then, what differenti-
ates protoplasm that forms 
the interior of living cells? 
One can see that the answer 
to this question changes 
with time, and often demar-
cates signi?cant changes in 
ideology over time. 
While the above men-
tioned are only a few of the 
conversations that occur in 
the book, one must under-
stand that as we as humans 
evolve, along with our ideas, 
and our technology, this 
question will get harder to 
answer simply because of the 
blurring boundaries between 
the “living” and “non-living”.
Thus, by putting forth 
these questions in the words 
of past intellectuals, Riskin 
engages the reader in evaluat-
ing these existential questions 
with respect to big-picture 
“processes” like evolution, 
arti?cial intelligence and 
epistemology.

Trepanation potentially capable of augmenting cerebral processes by increasing brain metabolism and ?uid ?ow
have in this specific region 
of the brain. However this 
method, too, has some short-
comings. First is the inva-
siveness of the procedure 
required to implant the fiber 
optic cable in the brain which 
has the potential for damag-
ing other brain structures 
and resulting in infection. 
Second is the time delay in 
activating the targeted cells; 
using optogenetic techniques 
these cells can take between 
20 seconds and a minute 
to be activated. Brasier de-
scribes that while still an 
improvement over phar-
macological methods, 
this delay poses prob-
lems for research-
ing the activity of 
neural networks 
in the brain 
since much of 
the functioning 
of the network 
is determined 
by how differ-
ent cells interact 
over a course of 
time rather than 
just by their lo-
cation. Two cells 
might both be ac-
tivated, but with-
out precise data 
regarding time it 
is difficult to de-
termine which cell is 
activating the other and 
how the circuit mediates the 
observed 
behavior. 
The new 
magnetogenetic 
techniques pio-
neered by the lab 
of Dr. Ali Güler 
present a solution 
to these previous 
problems. The 
Magneto protein 
does not require 
any invasive sur-
gery to be able 
to be activated and 
are able to work on 
the scale of a sec-
ond or less, much 
closer to the acti-
vation capabili-
ties of neurons 
themselves. 
Brasier as-
serts that “By 
looking at pre-
cise temporal 
patterns and 
controlling 
neurons in 
[said patterns], 
we can under-
stand how the 
timing, relative 
timing of activ-
ity in a couple of 
sub populations in 
neurons affects be-
havior, or memory, 
or perception, and so 
we can not only say ... 
inhibitory inter-neurons 
that express this gene, what 
do they do for behavior when 
I turn them all off/on’ now I 
can say what happens when 
I turn them off for one sec-
ond, off for two seconds—in-
troduce a pattern of activity 
... get at how the timing of 
activity relates to behaviors 
and perceptions and so on.” 
This means that we have an 
increased ability to test spe-
cific patterns more similar 
to neurons’ natural firing 
rates. In Brasier’s words: 
“[We are] getting much 
closer to the time scales that 
neurons actually communi-
cate with each other; this al-
lows the ability to have more 
precise control over the pat-
tern of activity. 
Rather than blasting the 
neurons high or turning 
them all the way off, you can 
have a finer control over the 
finer temporal patterns these 
neurons are having.”
Electrical stimulation 
gave researchers specificity 
in location; pharmacological 
methods gave researchers 
specificity in cell type; opto-
genetic techniques blended 
these together for greater 
control; and now magento-
genetics is giving scientists 
the ability to control all of 
these other factors as well as 
controlling the specific tim-
ing of these events. 
So what do these tech-
niques mean for our under-
standing of the brain or our 
reality? 
Will we soon be con-
trolled by our magnet wield-
ing overlords? 
When asked if these if 
sensationalized fears that 
this might be the grounds 
for “mind-control,” Brasier 
responded, “Yeah, I think 
that would be possible in 
principle. Even now you 
could find a spot where you 
could implant things and 
make my arm twitch, and, 
for a couple hundred dollars, 
you can get a little kit where 
you can do a little surgery on 
a roach, and you can have 
a radio controlled roach,” 
Brasier said. 
“Even more complicated 
things people have done to 
influence mouse behavior. 
In some ways, [humans are] 
even easier to control than 
mice because our brains are 
bigger, and the targets are 
bigger. Technically, I think 
it’s quite possible to at least 
control movement; we un-
derstand a fair amount about 
the area of the brain that 
move the arms around, move 
the legs around and so on, 
and also on the areas that 
first receive sound and visual 
perceptions.” 
We don’t have as good 
a map as of yet about what 
comes between sensation 
and perception; it may be 
possible in the next few 
decades to be able to alter 
somebody’s, give somebody 
a very particular perception; 
there’s one paper that was 
published three years ago, 
where they found a way to 
[alter perception] with opto-
genetics. 
They called it implanting 
a memory; they activated in 
a mouse the neurons which 
were previously active in a 
red room, and then give the 
mouse an electric shock; the 
mouse behaved as they were 
shocked in the red room; 
and so we can maybe put in 
false memories, manipulate 
people’s memories, and so  
that’s something that is very 
scary to think about in a lot 
of ways.” 
“Even the experiment 
used to pioneer the Magneto 
protein provided grounds for 
this impressive and intimi-
dating control over percep-
tion and thought.”
Brasier comments that 
“They turn on the brain’s re-
ward center when the animal 
is in a green room, animals 
develop a strong preference 
to going into the green room. 
“Already with the very 
first report about this pro-
tein, they’re already essen-
tially doing a thought-im-
plantation-like-thing where 
they’re impacting the way an 
animal feels about a specific 
area.” 
However, within the 
context of previous meth-
ods before magnetogenet-
ics, this power does not 
seem at all that surprising. 
Psychopharmacological 
methods have been modulat-
ing and altering perception 
from even before we under-
stood the methods. Examples 
range from prescription an-
ti-psychotics to your morn-
ing coffee. These all alter 
in different ways how we 
experience our reality by 
introducing an outside factor 
and inducing a change at the 
neural level. Optogenetics 
and magenetogenetics now 
serve as an evolution in the 
precision and accuracy of 
these methods so that poten-
tially these desired effects 
are achieved without any of 
the side effects that come 
along with the extremely 
complicated system that is 
the mammalian brain. 
The dopamine system in 
one part of the brain helps to 
regulate muscle movement 
and in another regulates 
the reward and attention 
systems of the brain. 
A malfunction in the first 
yields Parkinson’s Disease 
and in the latter yields 
Schizophrenia. 
Many of the psychophar-
macological methods for 
treating these diseases yield 
side effects by activating 
or deactivating the other 
system. 
Electrical implants have 
been devised for Parkinson’s 
patients to activate these 
specific cells in this specific 
area, but that method re-
quires an invasive surgery 
that opens up the patient to 
all sorts of complications and 
potential damage. 
Magnetogenetics seems to 
afford an opportunity to ne-
gate most, if not all, of these 
potential side-effects by be-
ing able to specifically target 
a distinct sub-population of 
neurons in a specific region 
of the brain without the need 
for invasive surgery. 
This opens up not only a 
larger realm of study with 
human subjects, it also may 
allow for more rigorous ap-
plications in other realms. 
Perhaps magnetogenetics 
may have implications for fu-
ture treatments to deep-brain 
disorders. As we become in-
creasingly able to determine 
the functions of circuits, we 
may be getting increasingly 
close to being able to control 
them.
While this discovery may 
be leading us down the path 
of “mind-control,” it is a path 
we began with the very in-
ception of the field of neuro-
science and this discovery is 
merely providing enhanced 
precision and safety to the 
methods of “mind-control” 
that are currently and readily 
being used by researchers 
and physicians.
St. Petersburg Comparative 
Physiology of Circulation 
Laboratory, might be able 
to ?nally speak to the po-
tential medical bene?ts of 
trepanation.
An article published on 
the Beckley Foundation’s 
website says that “the brain’s 
productivity depends on es-
sentially three factors: blood 
?ow, mobility of cerebrospi-
nal ?uid (CSF … ), and the 
?exibility of the skull.” 
Blood brings glucose and 
oxygen to the brain, among 
other things; these two me-
tabolites allow the brain to 
function and survive. 
Cerebrospinal ?uid pro-
vides cushioning to the brain 
and provides some basic im-
munological functions, such 
as waste removal.
Moskalenko’s technique 
allows researchers to track 
changes in these three pa-
rameters simultaneously, 
and his research posits that 
if the skull’s ?exibility is di-
minished, cerebrospinal ?uid 
mobility is decreased, and 
the brain’s functionality is 
decreased as a result. 
In order to back up these 
?ndings, he has also “shown 
that senile dementia and oth-
er age-related mental disor-
ders of a vascular nature are 
more closely linked to a drop 
in CSF mobility than a de-
crease of blood ?ow,” which 
corroborates the idea that 
CSF mobility is a factor in 
mental acuity. Moskalenko’s 
research is one of the only 
studies which has focused 
on factors and conclusions 
related speci?cally to trepa-
nation; Moskalenko focused 
on those who have had a 
craniotomy rather than a 
full-on trepanation. Using 
his measurement techniques, 
Moskalenko determined that 
trepanation caused the pulse 
stroke volume of the skull, or 
the amount of blood entering 
the skull after every heart-
beat, to increase 8–10 percent 
on average. 
This increase means 
that more oxygen and more 
metabolites enter the brain, 
functionally increasing the 
brain’s processing power. 
While an increase in brain 
blood ?ow might seem fright-
ening to some, Moskalenko’s 
research assures us that this 
increase is within the safe 
range of cerebral circulation. 
It appears as if pressure 
reductions in the brain (as a 
result of a more ?exible skull) 
may result in some actual 
physiological effects.
Trepanation has a rather 
gruesome history, and per-
haps an equally bright future. 
It does enter some dangerous 
territory, however, as a medi-
cal procedure performed 
solely for the purpose of hu-
man augmentation. In profes-
sional sports, steroid usage is 
often regarded with an “ev-
eryone’s doing it” mentality. 
In academics, Adderall has a 
reputation for being misused 
among hardcore students. 
Medication or operation 
just for the sake of “being 
better,” and not as a speci?c 
treatment, gets into some 
shady territory. When you 
start augmenting humanity 
with medicine, you’re effec-
tively “treating” the default 
human condition. And once 
we start viewing natural hu-
man features as something 
that need to be remedied, we 
start voyaging into some very 
dangerous ethical territory 
with no clean-cut resolution.Jarel Grant/Assistant Art Editor

On April 3 and April 4, 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
golf team competed at the 
15-team Hershey Cup. The 
Tartans ?nished with a team 
score of 624 (309–315) to 
?nish ?rst. Allegheny College 
?nished in second place after 
taking 11 strokes more than 
Carnegie Mellon. The Univer-
sity of Rochester ?nished 16 
strokes back.
Junior Brad Jennette was 
crowned the top individual 
medalist after ?nishing the 
36-hole tournament with a 
?ve-over-par 147 (72–75) to 
win the event. Junior George 
Qian ?nished seven strokes 
behind Jennette and tied 
for fourth with a 155 stroke 
showing (77–78). Junior 
Jordan Klodowski carded 
rounds of 80 and 79 to ?nish 
with a 159 followed by soph-
omore Nikhil Mohan who 
?red a 36-hole score of 163 
(80–83). Sophomore Adrian 
Del Bosque rounded out the 
Tartans’ top ?ve golfers with 
a 174 (88–86). Junior Alex-
ander Pomerantz entered the 
tournament as an individual, 
?nishing with a 170 mark 
(88–82).
On April 6, the Tartans 
hosted the annual Carnegie 
Mellon Spring Invitational. 
The Tartans carded a 304 to 
place ?rst out of six teams.

Tartan tennis rolls over the competition week by weekVillanova takes D-1 National Championship at the buzzer
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
tennis team closed off a week-
end of play with a tight battle 
against 18th-ranked Kenyon 
College at home on the eve-
ning of Sunday April 3, bat-
tling to continue to show why 
they deserve to be ranked as 
one of the premier teams in 
Division III.  
The Tartans kept the com-
petition close after some 
struggles in doubles play. The 
Tartans won 5–4, and they 
continue to establish them-
selves as a premier team in 
Division III.
The men came out ?ring in 
doubles play, as two of three 
duos went up by a game in the 
?rst few minutes of play.  Af-
ter four or ?ve games of play, 
Carnegie continued to pull 
out in front.  With a 2–2 split 
in sophomore Jeffrey Chen 
and junior Kenny Zheng’s play 
looking like the tight competi-
tion, the men looked to be in 
good position.
Chen and Zheng  took ad-
vantage of the momentum 
of the break to give Carnegie 
Mellon its ?rst point, however 
the other doubles teams fell 
6–8, giving Kenyon a 2–1 lead.
With the doubles competi-
tions wrapped up, play tran-
sitioned to singles matchups.  
In the top singles game, the 
Tartan’s senior player Ab-
hishek Alla fell behind early, 
losing an early break and let-
ting the ?rst set get away from 
him.  Dropping the set 1–6, 
Alla had only game going into 
the second set.
However, in a day ?lled 
with midgame turnarounds, 
Alla poured it on early, jump-
ing out to a 5–1 lead before 
giving up a second game.  This 
still allowed Alla to take the set 
6–2 to bring the match to the 
3rd set.
In the Tartan’s second sin-
gles match, ?rst-year player 
Daniel Levine challenged for 
another singles win.  Unlike 
Alla, Levine wasn’t looking to 
leave things up to suspense.  
He took control of the ?rst set 
midway through with a break, 
and extended the success with 
a win in both sets. Levine’s two 
set singles victory was accom-
panied by a 6–2, 6–1 win by 
?rst-year player Chaz Down-
ing, and another singles loss, 
to tie the Tartans up with Ken-
yon, 3–3. The Tartans showed 
their depth in the ?nal stage, 
leading in the sixth singles 
match and showing their com-
petitiveness at all levels before 
ultimately taking the victory.
The Carnegie Mellon ten-
nis teams took to the courts on 
Saturday to square off against 
the Blue Jays of regional rival 
Johns Hopkins University. The 
men’s team won a hard-fought 
match by a slim margin, 5–4, 
and the women’s team contin-
ued their domination by win-
ning 8–1. This victory brings 
the Tartans to a 13–5 record.
The men’s team scored the 
points that mattered in dou-
bles play. The duo of seniors 
Alla and Yuvraj Kumar scored 
the ?rst point of the day for 
the Tartans, winning third 
doubles by a score of 9–7. The 
less experienced ?rst-year pair 
of Vayum Arora and Levine 
dropped a barn burner of a 
set in ?rst doubles, but Chen 
and Zheng came in clutch for 
the Tartans, giving their team 
a 2–1 lead going into singles 
play. 
The Blue Jays would not be 
silenced, however. They took 
second and ?rst singles to take 
a 3–2 lead in the favor of Johns 
Hopkins, and suddenly the 
Tartan men were on the back 
foot.
 Zheng scored another im-
portant point for the Tartans 
in fourth singles, winning 6–0, 
7–5. Arora clawed the lead 
from the clutches of the Blue 
Jays in ?fth singles, winning 
6–3, 7–5.
Downing was the player 
of the day, however. Downing 
made a come from behind vic-
tory in third singles, forcing a 
second set tiebreaker and scor-
ing ?ve unanswered points to 
take the set.  Downing also 
scored three straight points in 
the third set to take the match 
win, 6–7 (9–11), 7–6 (8–6), 
6–4.
The 11th-ranked women’s 
tennis team had a much easier 
road to victory. They started 
the day off right by sweep-
ing doubles play against their 
12th-ranked opponents. Se-
nior Brooke Tsu and ?rst-year 
Jamie Vizelman scored the 
?rst point of the day for the 
Tartans, winning 8–4. The pair 
of sophomore Cori Sidell and 
?rst–year Minami Makino won 
9–7 against a higher-ranked 
duo, while senior Abbey Ham-
stra and junior Nicholle Torres 
completed the sweep of dou-
bles by winning 9–8 (7–2).
Sidell was the ?rst to ?n-
ish singles play in the third 
position, winning 6–1, 6–2. 
First-year Marina Selenica and 
Makino also scored victories 
in singles play. Selenica won 
6–0, 6–4 in sixth singles while 
Makino took ?fth singles with 
a score of 4–6, 6–4, 1–0 (10–
7). Tsu stepped up against the 
second best player in the re-
gion, and won 2–6, 6–4, 6–3 in 
?rst singles. Torres closed out 
the day in the second position, 
winning 6–3, 7–6 (7–4).
The Tartans will now move 
on to the UAA Championships, 
held in Altamonte Springs, 
Florida on April 21–23.

Last Monday night in Hous-
ton, Texas, University of North 
Carolina (UNC) and Villanova 
University put on a show while 
battling for the NCAA champi-
onship. In classic style, the Vil-
lanova Wildcats emerged vic-
torious over the opposing Tar 
Heels in an end-to-end effort.
Villanova’s 77–74 win gives 
them their second national 
championship in program 
history, and their ?rst since a 
1985 win over Georgetown. 
It also ends a six-tournament 
streak of Villanova not making 
it through the second round.  
Throughout the tourna-
ment run, the Wildcats looked 
dominant, taking huge wins 
over top opponents on their 
climb up the bracket. The 
Wildcats had an especially no-
table win over the top seeded 
Kansas Jayhawks in the Elite 
Eight, beating out a favorite 
on the way to showing which 
team was the real team to beat.
UNC returns empty hand-
ed, with a concern about po-
tential NCAA sanctions for ac-
ademic fraud. With potential 
sanctions looming, UNC came 
up a bit short of getting a na-
tional championship win be-
fore their window of opportu-
nity will potentially be closed 
by penalties. UNC is currently 
under investigation for pro-
viding improper help to strug-
gling student athletes through 
special independent study 
style courses. Given their po-
tential predicament, UNC put 
a big ?ght in the matchup.
The ?nal 10 seconds 
highlighted the intensity of the 
game, with Villanova leading 
74–71 going into the ?nal se-
quence. UNC pressed the ball 
up the court, and UNC senior 
guard Marcus Paige contorted 
his body to make the game ty-
ing three-pointer in the face of 
an oncoming defender. With 
only four seconds on the clock, 
Villanova made their argu-
ment for why they were the 
team to beat, racing up the 
court to try for a game winner.
With a second left, se-
nior guard Ryan  Arcidiacono 
tossed the ball back to junior 
forward Kris Jenkins, for a 
chance at the game. Jenkins 
caught the ball in motion to 
shoot, and dropped a game 
winning three-pointer in 
the net as time expired. The 
lightning response by Villa-
nova showed a team that had 
a broad range of weapons at 
their disposal in the game.The 
game looked to be a back and 
forth from the gun, with Villa-
nova winning the ball to start, 
only to turn it over and give 
UNC the chance to take the 
game’s ?rst points. The game 
score was tied nine times with 
constant lead changes, in a 
true championship battle.
Ten minutes into the ?rst 
half, Villanova looked like they 
were building a lead, only to 
watch a ?ve-point lead turn 
into a four-point de?cit. A 
clutch three-pointer by UNC 
sophomore guard Joel Berry II 
saw to that. By the end of the 
half, UNC looked like the team 
that had it ?gured out, holding 
off a Villanova counterattack 
to go into the locker room up 
?ve.
It took no time to get back 
to even for the Wildcats, but 
by six minutes into the sec-
ond half they did it. Villanova 
freshman guard Mikal Bridges 
took a pass by Arcidiacono and 
slammed it through the basket 
to tie things back up.
Going off Bridges’ dunk, 
Villanova looked to build a 
lead, and succeeded in work-
ing their way up by 10 points 
with a little over ?ve minutes 
left in regulation. A smooth 
three-point shot by UNC’s 
Paige help energize their unit 
in a ?ght to close back up in 
the ?nal minutes. 
All of this battling built 
up to the clock racing ?nish 
the made the championship 
game one to be remembered. 
The fans showed the seismic 
level of the swing, with their 
responses to the shots. With 
Paige’s game tying shot at 
four seconds, the UNC crowd 
roared, as a tide of light blue 
jumped up in response to the 
shot. 
The audience, it seemed 
was largely for UNC, and a 
proud Michael Jordan with 
his arms raised up seemed 
emblematic of the success of 
UNC’s comeback.
But Villanova was not to 
be outdone. Jenkins’ response 
shot shattered the UNC pic-
ture with a Villanova uproar. 
With the ?nal seconds ticking 
down, Jenkins took ?ight from 
well beyond the three-point 
line and sent his Hail Mary to 
the basket. 
Millions held their breath, 
the world slowed to a grinding 
halt, and then the only sound 
was the ball falling cleanly 
through the net. As Villanova 
re-broke the tie with the UNC 
basketball powerhouse, the 
dark blue jumped out. 
With a sudden ?ip-?op, 
the stadium seemingly trans-
formed as the Villanova crowd 
erupted. Jenkins and the rest 
of the Villanova squad explod-
ed in celebration with the fans 
and the Wildcats rode off into 
the history books.
As far as NCAA champi-
onship games go, this is one 
to be remembered for a long 
time. Both star-studded sides 
fought an unforgettable back 
and forth battle right up to the 
?nish.
FIFA leaders continue to be berated for corrupt practices
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
The International Federa-
tion of Association Football 
(FIFA) is no stranger to scan-
dals, but the Panama Papers 
scandal detailing corruption 
among some of the wealthi-
est leaders and corporations 
has brought further scru-
tiny to the already tarnished 
organization.
On May 27, 2015, a crack-
down began as 14 FIFA of-
?cials and corporate execu-
tives were arrested in Zurich 
based on indictments from 
the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), and the 
Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). Among the charges, 
prosecutors alleged that at 
least one vote for the hosts of 
the 2010 FIFA World Cup had 
been sold to the highest bid-
der: in this case, prosecutors 
alleged that Jack Warner, a 
committee member from Trin-
idad and Tobago, was offered 
$1 million from Morroco’s bid 
committee before he accepted 
a $10 million payout from 
South Africa, the eventual 
host of the World Cup.
“These individuals and 
organizations engaged in 
bribery to decide who would 
televise games, where the 
games would be held, and 
who would run the organiza-
tion overseeing organized soc-
cer worldwide,” said U.S. At-
torney General Loretta Lynch 
in a statement to the media 
following the announcement 
of the arrests. Lynch further 
compared the investigation 
into the FIFA of?cials to those 
of Ma?a members in Italy, cit-
ing their usage of the Ameri-
can banking system as part of 
their schemes.
On June 2, then-FIFA presi-
dent Sepp Blatter announced 
that he would resign his posi-
tion once the FIFA congress 
decided on a successor. Af-
ter winning a ?fth term on 
May 29, the growing calls for 
change amid the fallout from 
the May 27 arrests seemed to 
?nally win out. “FIFA needs a 
profound overhaul,” Blatter 
said during his announcement 
of his resignation. “While 
I have a mandate from the 
membership of FIFA, I do not 
feel that I have a mandate 
from the entire world of foot-
ball — the fans, the players, 
the clubs, the people who live, 
breathe and love football as 
much as we all do at FIFA.”
On Feb. 26, 2016, Swiss 
executive Gianni Infantino 
was elected president of FIFA 
after gaining a simple major-
ity on the second ballot. “We 
will restore the image of FIFA 
and the respect of FIFA, and 
everyone in the world will ap-
plaud us,” Infantino said dur-
ing his acceptance speech at 
the convention hall in Zurich. 
“We have to be proud of what 
we will do together. I want to 
work with all of you in order 
to restore and rebuild a new 
era in FIFA, a new era where 
we can again put football in 
the center of the stage.” Dur-
ing the same meeting of FIFA’s 
207 eligible members, a num-
ber of reforms were passed. 
These changes included 
new term limits for the FIFA 
president, council members, 
and committee members, a 
new 36-member FIFA Coun-
cil to replace the 24-member 
executive committee which 
previously determined the 
World Cup host, an indepen-
dent compliance committee to 
monitor the council, and the 
separation of power between 
political decision-making and 
business operations. It seemed 
as if Infantino’s reign as the 
new head of FIFA might be 
able to cleanse the organiza-
tion of its shady reputation.
Yet, six weeks after his 
reign started, Infantino and 
others were named in the 
dump of 11 million documents 
detailing corruption. During 
Infantino’s time as legal coun-
sel for the Union of European 
Football Associations (UEFA), 
the UEFA sold television 
broadcasting rights to Full 
Play Group, rights which were 
then resold at a considerable 
margin.
Infantino is not the only 
one under scrutiny. On Mon-
day, FIFA’s independent ethics 
committee con?rmed that one 
of its ethics lawyers was under 
investigation for a business 
relationship discovered by the 
Panama Papers. The leak ap-
parently detailed Juan Pedro 
Damiani and his law ?rm 
working for seven offshore 
companies linked to money 
laundering.
As if the continued ques-
tions of corruption among 
FIFA of?cials haven’t been bad 
enough, some of soccer’s big-
gest stars are also under ?re. 
The biggest name identi?ed 
by the leak was FC Barcelona 
forward Lionel Messi. Charges 
of how a company owned by 
Messi and his father called 
Mega Star Enterprises was 
used to avoid paying taxes on 
player’s image rights deals 
bring home just how much 
corruption there is in the 
world of international compe-
tition.
Though soccer will persist 
as the most heavily watched 
sport worldwide, of?cials are 
no longer afraid of the threat 
of expulsion from internation-
al competition as they pursue 
FIFA. 
Though Infantino has de-
nied any wrongdoing and 
pledged to ?ght corruption 
within FIFA even harder, only 
time will tell if FIFA can be 
cleansed and have its reputa-
tion restored.

The Carnegie Spirit
We stand appalled before the distress and suffering in the 
world today. Millions of helpless men, women, and children 
are destitute and homeless. Their very lives depend upon 
the bounty of our country. Our duty in the matter is plain. We 
must help, and help again. None of us can do much, but if 
each will make some real sacri?ce, the total of our gifts will 
do much to save those who cannot save themselves.
For years Mr. Carnegie has devoted his wealth and in?uence 
to the service of mankind. Our Institute of Technology 
is only one of his many achievements in helping others 
to the realization of a fuller life. All of us gladly admit our 
obligation to him for the opportunity given for growth 
and self-development. We must also admit our increased 
responsibility to contribute our share to the service of others.
To make our contribution a worthy part of the great offering 
our country is making, and must continue to make, to 
save the lives of the unhappy millions of the war stricken 
countries, we must have the spirit of hearty cooperation. 
Here, indeed, the Carnegie Spirit ?nd its fullest and highest 
expression. Can we not prove to ourselves and show to our 
founder that the best and truest expression of the Carnegie 
Spirit is found in the words, Service and Good-will? Let us 
convince Mr. Carnegie that our hearts, too, are in the work to 
which he has devoted so much of his life.
Value of the Editorial
From the articles appearing under this heading the entire 
character of the paper may be judged. The policies, the 
attitude toward current affairs, the state of progressiveness, 
and even to the general quality of news on other pages may 
be determined from the editorial page.
We have strived through our editorial columns to promote 
the things that are of vital interest to the school and to the 
individual student. Such suggestions as we may offer or such 
plans as we may advance are, however, mere words covering 
so much space, unless the students take an active interest in 
the editorials and cooperate with the authors.
Some of you read “The Tartan” as if it is a duty forced upon 
you, but do you read it with the idea in mind that is the 
“voice of the school” and is promoting policies which affect 
you personally? Our aim is to have every man interested in 
the school in general and in some phase of activity in
particular.
If something is advocated in our columns and you see 
no one grasping at its aim, get after it yourself. In case 
someone else is in the ?eld on the same errand, join hands 
and put it through. That is what our sister publication calls 
“constructive” school spirit.

100 Years Ago: 1916
Militarism or 
Democracy?
The battle now raging comes as the direct result of 
the non-Christian lives followed by the peoples of 
the warring nations. It is primarily a conflict of sys-
tems of governments — not of crowned heads; it is 
fundamentally a battle of peoples. A hundred British 
cabinets may fall, yet the strife in defense of English 
rights goes on. A hundred Kaisers, Kings, or Emperors 
may be laid to dust, but their passing means nothing 
for the interests of peace. Peace propagandas, such as 
the Ford Peace Party, will be directed with no visible 
result — at the base of all lies our Christian teaching 
unheeded.
Two irreconcilable systems of government have met 
in conflict and they must fight to the surrender or 
extermination of either party. Either the German 
military system will rule Europe or democracy and 
individual peace will be the ruler. There is no possible 
compromise. It will continue until either one side or 
the other is defeated. 
Then, and only then, beyond the shriek of strife and 
the toll of blood, will the welcome rainbow of enduring 
peace be seen — a long peace after a frightful war.

It may be of interest to those dramatically inclined to 
know just where this talented actor stands in regard to 
this subject since he and Mrs. Faversham (Julie Opp) 
publicly confess having gladly stood sponsors for this 
movement at its inception. 
The Pittsburgh centre of The Drama League, tendered 
to these distinguished guests a reception and 
luncheon in the rose room of the Fort Pitt not long 
ago, upon which occasion Mr. Faversham made his 
position, in regard to this organization, very plain.
The steely glitter of his eyes betrayed the feeling 
beneath the half quizzical recital of “The Theatre of the 
Imagination in the year 3000” —  when the audience 
goes in a ?ying machine to the Theatre; where, on a 
bare stage, a man in dress clothes encircled by a spot-
light awaits them. 
The play is “Hamlet”—After some time the actor 
observes that the auditorium is ?lled and calls out 
— “ I am ready” —  the said audience grasps levers 
attached to the seats beneath, then closes its eyes and 
the current is turned on. 
After a certain time the current is turned off —  there 
is a slow return to normal consciousness with this 
remark — “ Fine play that — this Shakespeare was a 
great writer in his time; if only actors had known how 
to play him then!”
Evidently Mr. Faversham does not believe in leaving 
too much to the imagination and sees danger in the 
present tendency in certain quarters — also he resents 
the “Pink Tea attitude” into which, he asserts, The 
Drama League has fallen — publicly proclaims his lack 
of sympathy with the social side of it, where it in any 
way tends to exploit the actor on the wrong side of 
the footlights and invade his private domain as to his 
tastes and habits. 
He deplores the curiosity which leads people to be 
interested in whether or not the actor eats spaghetti 
and says frankly that “to know an actor too well off 
the stage is to take the gilt off the gingerbread — to 
destroy illusion.”
Mrs. Faversham felt called upon to “edit” (as she 
put it) her husband’s remarks by saying that if he 
seemed severe it was only because of his earnest 
interest in the future of The Drama League and 
their disappointment in its failure to meet their 
expectations as they had both enthusiastically given 
time and effort to the movement in the hope that it 
would bring to the theatre the support of those who 
would demand only the best. 
They had hoped the League might have considerable 
in?uence in the way of educating managers to the 
higher needs of the public and the most hopeful 
sign on the present occasion was the attitude of the 
toastmaster, when he said that his only interest in 
the League was the hope that it might bring to the 
knowledge of the non-playgoer, who stayed away 
because he did not know what to choose, the right 
plays and eventually give them a right price — a 
gallery of dollar seats — then the League will have 
justi?ed its existence.
Unquestionably this, luncheon gave also food for 
thought — one got the actor’s point of view — very 
clearly, and it seems a most rational one, worth while 
“passing on” to those who consider the future of the 
stage seriously.

Rebecca Brown, a recent transfer student from Muskingum 
College in New Concord, Ohio (John Glenn’s home town), 
was named Queen of last Saturday evening’s 1964 Military 
Ball.
The crowning of the queen was of?ciated at about 11:00 
p.m. by Colonel Gallagher. Last year’s Military Ball Queen, 
Eileen Mauclair, was ?rst called to the stage in The 
Skibo Ballroom, after which each of the queen aspirants 
was called. Coming to the stage, each passed through a 
formation of drawn swords. Miss Mauclair then proceeded 
to give a brief talk on each of them.
After this, envelopes were passed to Colonel Gallagher, who 
proceeded to announce the queen candidates. As each was 
announced, she walked to the front of the stage to accept 
a bouquet of ?owers. Becky’s of?cial title was Honorary 
Regimental Commander. At the announcement of the 
Queen, Becky stepped forward to receive a bouquet and a 
small replica of the trophy received by her representative 
fraternity, Sigma Nu. Becky’s pin-mate, Jim Black, a Sigma 
Nu, accepted the fraternity trophy. After the crowning of 
the queen, a Scabbard and Blade member, Sieve Blue, 
and Becky, along with last year’s queen, Eileen, and Mike 
Ingram, led those at the ball in a Grand March. They were 
followed by the Queen’s runners-up.
Following the Grand March, the two leading couples began 
the Honorary Regimental Commander. The ballroom of 
Skibo had been appropriately decorated for the evening’s 
affair with streamers arranged uniformly across the ceiling, 
and multi-colored balloons which were released from large 
clear-plastic bags at various times during the evening. For 
those with “rhythm in their blood,” up-tempo dance music 
was provided by a local combo, the Silhouettes, along with 
music by Brad Hunt and his Orchestra.
Each couple at the dance received a complimentary color 
photograph by the Midwest Photo Company. Becky Brown 
asked that this newspaper convey her sincere appreciation 
to those who gave her their support. She wanted them to 
know that she highly respects the honor of the title, and 
that being chosen for it was a tremendous thrill for her. A 
junior social studies major from Butler, Pennsylvania, Queen 
Becky Brown is a Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority member.

New Machines At 
Morewood
Automatic milk dispensers and beverage coolers 
have been installed in the Morewood Garden’s caf-
eteria. Though residents complain that the new milk 
machines limit milk capacity in their glasses, the 
machines are actually helpful innovations. 
Unlike the hand-operated lever machines, these are 
automatic push button types which include a tray 
rack. The $900 machines hold two five gallon cans 
and consist of a refrigerator and pressure mecha-
nism.
The lemonade-orange beverage coolers provide cold-
er drinks than the previously distributed cartons of 
juice. Girls appreciate the additional refrigeration but 
complain that there are no longer any cartons of juice 
to take back to their rooms.
Mr. Helm, Director of Food Service, explained that, 
“as the number of girls increases, major renovations 
will be made in the Morewood Garden’s kitchen-
cafeteria facilities.”

50 Years Ago: 1966
(N.B. This is the ?rst in a series of articles on the diverse 
departments of Carnegie Tech.)
Carnegie Tech’s Department of Chemical Engineering 
seems to be characterized by courses whose names 
are deceptively complex and confusing. The entering 
freshman who intends to major in “Chem E” takes the 
regular Engineering and Science curriculum of chemistry, 
physics, math, English composition, and western 
civilization. As a sophomore, however, he plunges into 
Process Principles I and II and Thermodynamics, titles 
which wreak confusion in the heart of the poor Maggie 
Murph. A knowledgeable “Chem E” confesses, however, 
the Process Principles consists of bubbling ammonia 
through water to discover that you have produces 
ammonia water! 
The purpose of all this bubbling and distillation is to 
discover how much energy it takes, and this seems to 
set the keyword for the whole department - ef?ciency 
and economy in the process of chemical research. 
Thermodynamics is a fancy name for pumping ?uids 
through pipes (on paper) to discover the principle of 
conversation of energy. They have found for instance, 
that the water in the middle of the pipe goes much faster 
than that around the edges, and after a certain speed is 
attained, all the water will rush around with mad energy 
in all direction in the pipe (that’s not conserving much 
energy).
As a junior, the “Chem E” takes the impressive sounding 
course “Heat, Mass and Momentum Transfer,” which was 
called “Unit Operations” before. Neither name, adequately 
describes the delightful content of the course; Momentum 
Transfer in two railroad trains of ?uids, going at different 
speeds in the same direction on two parallel tracks. When 
a little ?uid jumps from the faster train to the slower, the 
slower train speeds up. The “Chem Es” ?gure out exactly 
how much it speeds up.
Seniors take a special match course and an eight hour 
per week lab, where they actually begin some of these 
processes; it is called Unit Operations Lab and here they 
work on new designs for machinery, such as distillation 
cats to prepare chemicals. They stir different ?uids, 
comparing the amount of work it takes the stir them with 
how viscous they are.
There are even some that get thicker as you stir (egg 
whites do this) or get thinner; they have wonderful words 
like “thixotropic” to apply to them and how does one ?nd 
a preservative which will not affect the taste of ketchup? 
A “Chem E” has more fun in tests than almost any other 
student; a recent heat transfer quiz stated simply; “Will a 
hot cup of coffee cool faster if cream is added at once and 
then allowed to cool, or should the cooling process be ?rst, 
with the cream added later?” That’s knowledge for living!
Once in industry, seniors branch out; not only do they 
design reactors, evaporators, and distillation columns, 
for the preparation of chemical substances — like all the 
different grades of gasoline that Sunoco has (190, 200, 210, 
etc.) for different purposes, but they study how to best 
shove toothpaste into a pipe this is quite a problem in 
industry, believe it or not, and they work on the chemical 
structures of new synthetic ?bers.
Most “Chem E’s” don’t like “cookbook” recipes; “stir in a 
cup of hydrocarbons” has little appeal to them, and they 
would prefer more concentration on engineering courses 
in the department. They are not permitted until their senior 
year to really specialize and do independent research. The 
department, however, is recognized as one of the top in the 
country.

After an intricate sting operation, Pittsburgh Police have 
arrested four CMU students on drug possession charges. 
The students were arrested at their house in Shadyside on 
Thursday evening, January 24. 
Two other occupants of the house, who were not home at 
the time of the arrest, turned themselves in the following 
day. 
The operation began in Colorado when a Denver postal 
worker noti?ed police that a suspicious package had been 
posted for mailing to Pittsburgh. 
Authorities found one pound of hallucinogenic 
mushrooms in the package and subsequently asked 
Pittsburgh police to investigate its intended destination. 
After obtaining a search warrant, a Pittsburgh police 
of?cer, dressed as a UPS delivery person, delivered 
the package to the Shadyside address. The intended 
recipient, his girlfriend, and another man were home at 
the time. 
When the package was opened, a planted “beeper” 
signaled and 10 Pittsburgh police of?cers dressed in 
bullet-proof vests and armed with a battering ram entered 
the ?ve-bedroom house. 
During the ensuing search, the fourth student returned 
home and was subsequently placed under arrest. The 
students were taken to the North Hills station at 6:30 p.m.; 
they were not processed until 2 a.m. 
The three men were charged with four counts of drug 
violation and one count of tampering with records or 
identi?cation.” 
The package recipient also received one count of 
“criminal conspiracy to manufacture marijuana.” The 
woman, who is not a resident of the house, was charged 
with two drug violations, as a pipe and a small amount of 
marijuana were found in her purse. 
All four students spent the night in detention cells 
and were released on bail the following day. The Court 
Magistrate set bail at $5,000 for each of the men, and 
$1,000 for the woman. At 2:30 p.m., the girlfriend of one of 
the men used a bondsman to release three of the students. 
The other man had bail paid by one of his fraternity 
brothers. If bail had not been met, the students were 
scheduled to be transferred to Pittsburgh County Jail at 
4 p.m. Two additional occupants of the house returned 
home later on the evening of the arrest.

University Center
University Center to be completed on fall 1993
The new University Center should be completed 
“about the beginning of September of 1993,” according 
to Carnegie Mellon Senior Vice President Ed Schatz. 
“We hope to have it open and available for students’ 
use at the beginning of the 1993-94 school year,” said 
Schatz. 
“Right now, construction is scheduled to begin with 
the razing of Skibo Hall, which is to start around 
November 1 of this year,” he said. Unfortunately, 
according to Schatz, the building is projected to cost 
between $40–42 million. “[CMU President Robert] 
Mehrabian has said we won’t borrow any money to 
build it — so we have to have a good chunk of that 
money on hand.” So far, only the “schematic layout” 
part of the building design has been ?nished. Those 
drawings are on display in Skibo 100. Planning is 
currently in the “design and development” stage, said 
Schatz. “The architects are now worried about the 
functionality of the rooms, the ?nishing materials, and 
other details like that. They also talked with students 
about the uses for the building to help plan designs 
accordingly.”

Lawsuit alleges sexual misconduct by Cyert
File Photo by Thomas Nichols
Then-President Richard M. Cyert made sexual advances 
to a Carnegie Mellon employee when she worked for him 
in August 1972, according to a suit ?led by the employee 
in federal court in November 1989. 
After the employee resisted Cyert’s advances, Cyert 
worked for 16 years to deny her promotions and got her 
?red, ?nally succeeding in 1988, according to the legal 
complaint. 
The complaint also accuses CMU of age and sex 
discrimination in its promotion and dismissal decisions. 
Although Cyert and other University of?cials strongly 
deny the allegations made by 22-year CMU employee 
Patricia Tanner, the suit was settled out of court by the 
University in September for an undisclosed amount. 
“It’s just plain nonsense, and I’m not too interested in 
talking about it,” Cyert said of the sexual advances 
allegation. Current President Robert Mehrabian, who 
took Cyert’s job last July, also defended Cyert. 
“I totally believe in his integrity and I cannot believe that 
such allegations could possibly be true,” he said. 
“The allegations are unsubstantiated and 
unsubstantiable.” SUPA Dean Alfred Blumstein 
denied that Tanner was ?red because of sex or age 
discrimination. 
When questioned about these issues, Blumstein said, 
“Absolutely not. She was replaced by a woman; and 
[Tanner] was not very old.” Tanner was 55 at the time 
she was ?red. Tanner and employees of CMU are legally 
barred from discussing the details of the case by a clause 
in the settlement. However, Tanner’s complaint tells 
her side of the story and Senior Vice President for Legal 
Affairs Alvin Brannick told The Tartan that “if you read 
[our answer], then I think you would understand CMU’s 
position.” 
“It was a horrendous experience that I’m still having a 
dif?cult time getting through,” Tanner told The Tartan.

None of us are thrilled to be digging up an extra $1,250 
out of our pockets — pockets that in some cases are 
already pretty empty — to accommodate the 1991–92 
undergraduate tuition hike. 
But before we complain about spending more money, let’s 
take a look at what we’ll get in return. 
If the administration does what it promises to do with the 
money — and if CMU students do indeed get more bang 
for their buck — then the increase is a good idea. 
Supporting CMU’s aid-blind admissions policy (admitting 
students regardless of ?nancial need) is one of the major 
reasons behind the raise. 
More and more students are requiring ?nancial aid; to 
keep the level of aid where it is now, students who can pay 
more must. 
Faculty salaries and general services also necessitate the 
raise. 
Above all, it’s unrealistic to expect any school to increase 
what it offers — the quality of education and the quality of 
student life — without increasing what it takes in. 
Without more money, it’s impossible for CMU to keep pace 
with schools of its caliber. 
And none of us want Carnegie Mellon to fall behind. If an 
8.9 percent increase is what it takes to maintain CMU’s 
status as a ?rst-rate private university, then we support the 
tuition hike.
But only if the administration stands behind its word. 
When tuition was raised to $14,000 for this year, a $1,000 
increase from last year, students expected to get their 
money’s worth. 
But when the Modern Languages Department cancelled 
six courses and cited budgetary constraints as the main 
reason, at least 92 students were directly affected, and 
the entire campus was left doubting the sincerity of the 
administration’s intentions to provide top-rate education 
and go forward with new programs. 
A faltering of the University’s aid-blind admissions policy 
or a decrease in the quality of education would constitute 
a serious breach of trust between the administration and 
the student body. 
So next year, when this latest tuition hike goes into effect, 
we’ll be keeping our eyes and ears open. If students’ 
pocketbooks are an extra $1,250 lighter, they deserve what 
they’ve been promised.

Staying in the library all night might taste a little better 
next fall when the Maggie Murph Café opens on the ?rst 
?oor of Hunt Library. The new campus eatery will serve 
coffee, grab-and-go sandwiches, and salads.
Alumni, along with the University Libraries and Dining 
and Housing Services, are working together on the 
project.
“It’s a great partnership between the library and Dining 
Services,” said Tim Michael, director of Housing and 
Dining Services.
“Putting coffee shops in libraries is pretty common on 
college campuses, and they’re doing it in response to 
student demand,” Michael said.
Alumnae from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, 
the University’s former women’s college that the café 
is named for, began expressing interest in funding the 
project last fall. Lami Grubb Architects have completed 
the design for the space, which features service and 
seating areas as well as dedication panels funded by 
alumni. Suzan Lami and Robert Grubb are both alumni of 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Architecture.
“[Margaret Morrison alumnae] are so excited to have a 
place in the library,” said Erika Linke, associate dean of 
University Libraries.Housing and Dining Services have 
not yet selected the vendor for the new café. Michael 
plans for it to be open for longer hours than most campus 
dining locations, possibly from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The 
menu, he said, would 
be suited to serving breakfast and lunch blocks on the 
meal plan.
Michael is excited about the options at Maggie Murph. 
“The highlight will be the Starbucks coffee,” he said. 
“We’ll have a full cappuccino machine there.”
Dean of University Libraries Gloriana St. Clair hopes the 
café will increase student satisfaction with the library. 
“Our real vision for this is that the library will become an 
intellectual commons,” she said.According to St. Clair, 
there are just over half a million visits to the library each 
year. Linke and St. Clair predict a positive impact on the 
campus community stemming from the increased 
convenience to studying the café will 
provide.
“Typically, when people have eaten, they do better,” said 
Linke. “We see how student needs have been changing. 
We’re looking as well to build some group study rooms.”

Black students opt out of CMU
Despite dogged efforts by the Of?ce of Admissions, 
diversity is down at Carnegie Mellon this year.
The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education (JBHE) 
published its 14th annual survey of ?rst-year blacks at 
the nation’s highest-ranked universities and liberal arts 
colleges; Carnegie Mellon posted signi?cant declines in 
two population areas.
Carnegie Mellon’s number of black ?rst-years declined 25 
percent, with enrollment dropping from 79 to 59 students 
out of 1453 in this year’s ?rst-year class. The university 
is one of eight high-ranking universities with a decline 
greater than 10 percent.
Only 18 percent of black students offered admission at 
Carnegie Mellon accepted their offers. This statistic — 
black student yield — was lower at Carnegie Mellon 
than at any of its peer institutions.
“Our friends just outgunned us,” said William Elliott, 
vice-president of enrollment.
There was nothing subtle about 301 of 360 admitted 
black students opting for other institutions this year.
According to Carnegie Mellon’s admissions statistics, 
12 of those students chose the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) instead. Stanford University, Duke 
University, and ?ve Ivy League schools were among 
other top student alternatives.
“The ?nancial aid might be better at some of these 
schools. We’ll go back and analyze if ?nancial aid can be 
more generous, but you have to be careful there. Giving 
someone more money means someone else is getting 
less,” Elliott said.
The university saw applications from 940 black 
applicants this year, one of the highest numbers in 
school history. Elliott attributed the increase to Carnegie 
Mellon’s Summer Academy for Math and Sciences, a 
summer program geared towards the black and Hispanic 
populations. All of the approximately 1000 students 
that attended the program were encouraged to apply 
to Carnegie Mellon. This was a change from years past, 
when only certain students were encouraged based on 
their quali?cations.
“Some kids that applied from the summer program might 
have been encouraged to apply even though they were 
less than quali?ed. I can’t prove it.” Elliott said.
The California Institute of Technology (CalTech) is an 
institution similar to Carnegie Mellon in its focus on 
mathematics and sciences. While it appeared to have 
the largest percentage increase in black ?rst-years of all 
top-ranked universities, at 200 percent, it actually only 
had three black students in its ?rst-year class. Caltech 
was one of the smallest of all schools surveyed, with 1.4 
percent of the entire ?rst-year class composed of black 
students. Last year the school had one black student in 
its ?rst-year class. One of those students chose Caltech 
over an offer of admission from Carnegie Mellon.
Columbia University did the best of Ivy League 
institutions with blacks constituting 9.4 percent of the 
?rst-year class. The University of Pennsylvania posted a 
26 percent black acceptance rate, compared with only 
18 percent for the overall student body. This was one of 
the biggest acceptance differentials of all participating 
schools. Nearby Swarthmore College in suburban 
Philadelphia was top-ranked among liberal arts colleges, 
with 11.6 percent of ?rst-years being black.
Haverford College, ranked second, and Bryn Mawr 
College, ranked seventh, rounded out the trio of 
successful liberal arts colleges in this geographic area.
“Those three schools have all shown a deep commitment 
to increasing racial diversity. Location certainly helps: 
They can get students from Maryland, New York, and 
New Jersey, in addition to Pennsylvania,” said Robert 
Slater, managing editor for JBHE. Slater wrote the black 
enrollment survey article that reports on Carnegie Mellon 
and other top institutions’ enrollment statistics for his 
publication’s fall 2006 issue.
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill led all 30 
schools surveyed, with a 12 percent black ?rst-year class. 
The Tar Heels have earned the distinction of highest 
percentage of black students out of the entire ?rst-year 
class six times in eight years.

With all the activities going on during Carnival, some 
events slip through the cracks. The Big Boi concert, 
brought to us by Carnegie Mellon’s Activities Board, 
was one event that refused to do so. AB is no stranger 
to pulling off some stellar concerts. Its past Carnival 
concert successes include performances by The New 
Pornographers in 2009 and The Black Keys in 2010.
For this year’s Carnival, AB kept up the momentum 
of past success by introducing Carnegie Mellon 
to Big Boi, one half of the hip hop duo known as 
OutKast. The concert, which was almost relocated 
indoors due to weather misgivings, was held on the 
CFA Lawn. As concertgoers assembled around the 
stage, Hunt Library’s multicolored lights glowed 
in the background, adding to the excitement and 
heightening anticipation of the night’s performance.
When AB introduced the opener, Brother Ali, the 
crowd could barely contain its enthusiasm. Students 
from Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, and other schools 
welcomed the famous albino hip-hop artist as he took 
the stage and performed some of his more famous 
numbers. Brother Ali, straight off his Fresh Air Tour, is 
no stranger to the spotlight. Armed with a microphone 
and his DJ, Brother Ali set out to show the audience 
why his latest album is in Billboard’s Top 100. After 
pumping up the crowd, he exited the stage to raucous 
applause, greeting and hugging fans as he left.
After Brother Ali, Big Boi, the long awaited headliner, 
took the stage. Right away, he opened with an 
OutKast classic. As the lyrics to “Ms. Jackson” rang 
out, the crowd went crazy and started singing along. 
Big Boi, or Antwon André Patton — also known 
as Daddy Fat Sax and General Patton — kept the 
audience going with oldies, new hits like “Tangerine,” 
and politically charged numbers like “Bombs Over 
Baghdad.”
His onstage antics proved he was a masterful 
performer, combining talent and personality to win 
the crowd. Some, like sophomore Madeleine Kelly, 
were converted into fans when roommates and friends 
took them to the concert. Kelly, a materials science 
and engineering major, said her favorite part of the 
show was when Big Boi played “Shutterbugg.” “He 
was just as good live as when I was just listening to 
his music,” Kelly said. “I definitely think he was a hit 
here, especially since there were so many people not 
from Carnegie Mellon that attended.”
Kelly wasn’t the only one who thought the 
performance was powerful. “I’m in love with Big Boi 
and really liked the concert,” Ruari Egan, a sophomore

Scotch‘n’Soda presents poignant Cabaret
Carnival is usually an upbeat weekend, as students 
celebrate their days off from school and cheer on their 
classmates in Sweepstakes. Scotch’n’Soda brought a 
more serious note to Carnival this year, however, with 
its production of Cabaret. Cabaret focuses on the Kit 
Kat Club, a seedy cabaret club in Berlin, as the Nazis 
are rising to power. The play centers on the relationship 
between English cabaret performer Sally Bowles (Heinz 
College master’s student Shannon Deep) and American 
writer Clifford Bradshaw (junior music major Sean 
Pack).
The set was fairly sparse, with a balcony and staircases 
leading down on either side of the balcony and only a 
select number of furniture pieces that the crew added 
and removed from the stage as necessary. Around 
the edge of the stage were round tables with red 
tablecloths that audience members could sit at. During 
the scenes set at the Kit Kat Club, the seductive Kit Kat 
dancers would approach the edge of the stage and ?irt 
with the audience members sitting at the tables, which 
helped to reinforce the nightclub atmosphere. The Kit 
Kat performers were all excellent dancers and stayed 
in character well; Chandler Patton, a ?rst-year drama 
student, was particularly entertaining in the role of the 
young cabaret dancer Helga.
Deep was charming and did an excellent job of showing 
the complexities of Sally’s character; however, her 
singing voice, while lovely, lacked the power and depth 
necessary for the part. She and Pack, who played 
Clifford Bradshaw, had a great onstage chemistry, and 
Pack did an excellent job of portraying Cliff’s range of 
emotions.
Matt Zurcher, a sophomore humanities and arts major, 
played the Master of Ceremonies of the Kit Kat Club, 
and functioned as an omniscient storyteller throughout 
the show. Zurcher was a perfect mix of funny and 
creepy; he originally had the audience laughing with 
his eyebrow waggling and over-the-top attitude, but 
became progressively more eerie and terrifying as the 
show progressed and the Nazis gained more power.
Cabaret also featured a romantic subplot involving 
Cliff’s landlady, Fraulein Schneider (played by junior 
music major Gillian Hassert), and one of her boarders, a 
Jewish fruit vendor named Herr Schultz (played by Alex 
DiClaudio, a master’s student in Heinz College). Their 
scenes together were tender and funny, particularly 
when they sang “It Couldn’t Please Me More,” about a 
pineapple that Herr Schultz gives Fraulein Schneider.
Despite some inconsistencies with accents — some of 
the characters’ English and German accents sounded 
exaggerated — the show, as a whole, was a success. 
Will Weiner and Dan Wetzel, a sophomore economics 
and decision sciences major and a CIT master’s 
student, respectively, directed it. They put on a strong 
production, drawing the audience into the world of the 
Kit Kat Club while managing to be funny and poignant.

civil engineering major, said. “I loved when he played 
‘Fo Yo Sorrows’ off his new album — that’s my 
favorite song.” The album, Sir Luscious Left Foot… 
The Son of Chico Dusty, was released in July 2010.
Big Boi continued to present his album during the 
Carnival concert and played a good number of songs
from his new album, including “Shutterbugg” — one 
of the most popular songs on the album — “You Ain’t 
No DJ,” and “Shine Blockas” to name a few. He even 
let a group of girls from the audience go up and dance 
with him onstage for two or three songs, no doubt 
garnering some dedicated fans in the process. This 
crowd-pleasing tactic, along with the pulsating lights 
set up on the stage and the music videos playing on 
the left and right of the stage, all combined to form a 
well-planned and impressive concert spectacular.
Every year it seems like the Carnival concert is 
getting bigger, badder, and better. Congratulations to 
the coordinators of the AB Concerts and the Carnegie 
Mellon and Pittsburgh community for making this 
year’s Carnival concert something special. Next year 
will no doubt exceed expectations as well.

Re-engineering Lewis Carroll’s classic tale Alice in 
Wonderland, the final play of the School of Drama’s 2010–11 
season, The Alice Project, debuted last Thursday, April 14, 
at the Philip Chosky Theater. The Alice Project thrusts the 
timeless story of Alice in Wonderland into the spotlight of 
twenty-first century technology. In this twisted marriage of 
art and machinery, Alice explores what it is to be human in 
a world that is a far stretch from Victorian England. 
The Alice Project ponders the existential question: Who is 
Alice? The play leaves that up for question. At one point, 
Alice even forgets her own identity, before remember-
ing that she is, in fact, a human girl. As Alice moves from 
square to square in attempt to become a queen, different 
characters perceive her in different ways. However, no one 
way seems to correctly identify who she is. 
A play within a play, the story begins with the writers of 
The Alice Project interviewing Alice in an attempt to dis-
cover her personality and motives. While Alice says that she 
is home-schooled, has a governess, and appears to live in 
Pittsburgh, there is an ethereal quality about her that sug-
gests otherwise. As one of the writers begins to read aloud 
from a book about Alice, the story changes to follow the nar-
rative and suddenly the audience is watching the story of 
Alice herself, as she tumbles through Wonderland. Alice is 
played by four different actors: senior drama students Krista 
Marie Yu, Sara Trapnell, Evan Barron, and Tess Primack, 
who are able to act almost interchangeably, through the 
exchange of Alice’s iconic hair-ribbon, as the “real” Alice 
throughout the production. 
The juxtaposition of man and machine was an integral part 
of the performance. Notably, instead of a pit orchestra, there 
was a tech crew seated beneath the stage, orchestrating 
the complex visuals in each scene. Offsetting the changing 
digital backgrounds, the story used a three-tiered, metal, 
chess-like stage set in order to loosely tie together the story 
arcs. As Alice navigates from one square to the next, the 
story also progresses in different directions.
The combination of acting and live-action recording via the 
video cameras onstage produced a novel storytelling effect. 
Depending on one’s opinion, it created either a connection 
or a barrier for the characters, many of whom spoke primar-
ily into video cameras in order to interact with the different 
characters onstage on different squares. 
Trapnell, one of the Alices in the performance, spoke about 
The Alice Project after the show. “It’s been a really cool and 
interesting process,” Trapnell said. “Working on The Alice 
Project was challenging in a good way. We had to learn how 
to act with the cameras as if we were acting to someone. 
Physically it was also challenging, because there was a lot 
of climbing around the sets in practice. The Alice Project 
was a lot of fun to prepare and it is so exciting to see it all 
come together now onstage.”

Student government election results were released 
last Tuesday. Junior policy and management and 
Chinese studies double major JR Marshall and junior 
information systems major Jibby Ayo-Ani were 
rati?ed on Wednesday as the incoming student body 
president (SBP) and student body vice president 
(SBVP), respectively.
Marshall and Ayo-Ani won with 37.18 percent 
of the total vote. Competitors junior information 
systems major Evan Wineland and sophomore math 
major Connie Yang came in second place with 
31.66 percent, while junior electrical and computer 
engineering major Divya Kothandapani and third 
year Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering 
Mark Whiting earned 14.61 percent. The ?nal 
running pair, senior statistics and economics double 
major Saif Jedidi and sophomore computer science 
major Ben Debebe, ended the election with 11.58 
percent of the vote.
Additionally, junior math major Benjamin Zhang was 
elected unopposed as student body vice president 
for ?nance (SBVPF). Meanwhile, sophomore 
chemical engineering and engineering and public 
policy double major Trevor Hadick was elected 
over sophomore math and economics double 
major Ryan LaPré as student body vice president 
for organizations (SBVPO). Hadick received 42.42 
percent of the vote, while LaPré received 29.16 
percent.
This year’s election demonstrated a signi?cant 
increase in student participation. 26.22 percent 
of total students cast votes, compared with 17.9 
percent in 2014. 41.06 percent of undergraduates 
voted, compared with 32.43 percent in 2014. 
Meanwhile, 10.36 percent of graduate students 
voted, almost triple the number who voted last year.
The election was “quite a ride,” Marshall said. 
He added that it was “really encouraging to get 
the campus involved in an election” and that all 
students “deserve a student government that works 
for them.”
According to Ayo-Ani, she and Marshall crafted 
a platform that addressed as many students as 
possible in an effort to increase student participation 
in the election. “Our goal from the very beginning 
was to get as many people involved as possible,” she 
said.
“Students are coming to realize what an important 
time this is in our long-term history,” Marshall said. 
He is con?dent that students are starting to “take 
ownership of the future of Carnegie Mellon.”
Marshall and Ayo-Ani ran on a platform that 
emphasized mental health awareness and efforts 
to combat sexual assault and relationship violence 
on campus, including getting all campus leaders 
certi?ed in the Survivor Support Network. In 
addition, they want to expand acceptance of DineX 
at businesses close to campus and establish a 
“Reorientation Day” in the middle of the semester to 
facilitate students’ mindfulness.
Current SBP and senior electrical and computer 
engineering and business administration double 
major Ian Glasner re?ected on his own tenure as 
SBP so far at Senate last week, citing successful 
campaigns such as the Proud to Be Plaid initiative 
and committee, the student initiatives website, and 
the Jared L. Cohon University Center expansion 
plan.
Glasner’s administration also fought to decrease 
exceptions to the university’s moratorium on having 
classes between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., so that all 
students can participate in extracurriculars, and to 
internalize Carnegie Mellon’s alcohol citation policy.
Glasner emphasized that, though many of his 
initiatives have become reality, there are still some 
that have yet to be corrected, such as housing and 
dining prices, which are much higher than those of 
off-campus options. He stressed that larger student 
movements are necessary to make the changes to 
these policies. “Housing and dining are not going to 
improve until that happens,” Glasner said.
Marshall and Ayo-Ani do not wish to set any ?rst 
priority for tackling their administration’s initiatives, 
as there are “so many issues of equal importance 
that can’t wait,” Marshall said.
They are already engaged in an “orchestrated, 
synthesized effort to set [their initiatives] in motion 
right away and get the right people in place,” 
Marshall said.
“[We’re] reaching out to administration to move from 
feasibility talks to talks of logistics,” Ayo-Ani said.
Each of their initiatives starts with student town 
halls, according to Marshall, to show that students’ 
voices are their administration’s top priority.
“We want to help give people that springboard to do 
great things here,” Ayo-Ani said.
“We’re not superheroes,” Marshall said, “but this 
student body is made up of superheroes.”
Marshall spoke of his working relationship with Ayo-
Ani saying, “We really consider ourselves a team. We 
share the same goals, the same values, and the same 
future for this campus.”
Marshall additionally expressed his desire to 
integrate their former competition into their 
administration: “We want to work with our 
competitors. They were so gracious, full of integrity, 
and real pleasure to run against, and they will 
continue to be just as much a part of the team ... to 
make the future a little brighter.”
“We’re really thankful that the student body would 
choose us to lead us through next year,” said 
Marshall. “We really believe we can leave [Carnegie 
Mellon] a lot better than how we found it.”

For 101st year, Carnival booths display scenes from a Living Library1 Year Ago: 2015Marshall, Ayo-Ani elected as SBP, SBVP
If you stepped onto Midway during this year’s 101st 
Spring Carnival celebration, you may have noticed 
some familiar faces—no, not the faces of peers or 
fellow alumni, but the faces that appeared in some of 
your favorite books.
This year’s Booth theme, Living Library, brought 
some of the most prominent books of the past and 
present to life on a Midway that seemed particularly 
polished. Despite a few hitches, like the failure of 
Delta Gamma and Alpha Chi Omega to open their 
Jumanji and The Twelve Dancing Princesses booths, 
respectively, it was delightful to see old classics like 
the Berenstain Bears and newer books like Life of Pi 
brought off the page and put onto the pavement of 
the Morewood Parking Lot.
Every year, the Carnival Committee examines the 
booths from top to bottom to determine which 
are the best of the best. This year, the committee 
awarded ?rst place in the fraternity and sorority 
categories to Alpha Epsilon Pi for their Jurassic Park 
booth and Kappa Alpha Theta for their Wonderful 
Wizard of Oz booth, respectively. For blitz booths, 
the committee awarded ?rst place to the Mellon 
College of Science for their The Hunger Games 
booth. For independent booths, the committee 
awarded the Taiwanese Students Assocation’s Life 
of Pi booth with ?rst place.
The Tartan similarly takes a look at every nook 
and cranny of the booths to determine which are 
the most successful, as well as which booths were 
most underrated. This year, we award our third 
annual Boothy Awards in what were, although not 
necessarily category winners, some of the best 
booths this year.
The Architecture Boothy for Best Design
Kappa Alpha Theta takes this boothy for their 
unique staircase leading up to the second story 
that replicated a tornado with a grayscale theme to 
match the aesthetics of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz’s 
movie counterpart. The kitchen from Kansas at the 
beginning of the booth was also quaint and cozy, 
while the staircase leading down from the second 
story was impressive with its ?ying monkey at the 
base that looked as if it was taken straight from the 
movie.
In a close second, Delta Tau Delta’s Journey to the 
Center of the Earth booth had a similarly impressive 
staircase that replicated the feeling of walking into 
the depth’s of the Earth’s many layers. The loud, 
crushing sounds that reverberated around the 
staircase and a special mirror illusion added to the 
effect of walking into a never-ending space.
The Pong Boothy for Best Game
Phi Delta Theta’s Oculus Rift game at their Twenty 
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea booth went above 
and beyond to deliver a unique experience to the 
user. Guests put the virtual reality headset on and 
then proceeded to shoot the giant squid from the 
book out of the water to save the Nautilus submarine. 
The game was not only immersive, but generally 
seamless and fun to play.
Other games, like the Singapore Students’ 
Association’s The Little Prince game, were right 
up there with Phi Delta’s. The game had two users 
interact with a touchscreen to dig up plants that 
popped up on the screen. However, Phi Delta’s booth 
took the cake with its game’s impressive scope.
The Andy Warhol Boothy for Best Art
The TSA incorporated impressive art into their Life of 
Pi booth. Not only did they place an elaborate mural 
on the outside of their building that gave the whole 
structure an ancient feel, but they also constructed 
a number of paper mâché animals that visitors could 
interact with. Among the animals were the book’s 
iconic tiger in the equally iconic raft, a peacock, and 
a zebra. The art, both inside and outside, of this book 
captured the essence of the book perfectly.
The Boothy for Most Family-Friendly Booth
The Asian Students Association (ASA) takes 
this award with their Cloudy with a Chance of 
Meatballs booth. Of course, the theme of this 
booth automatically lends itself to a family-friendly 
atmosphere.
But ASA followed through with a fun ?shing game 
for the kids. A stream pushed wooden food through 
the game’s area. Players had to use a magnetic 
?shing rod to get the food. Overall, the booth had a 
light-hearted feel that had the potential to keep kids 
hanging around for much longer than they would 
at some of the more serious booths, like Student 
Dormitory Council’s 1984 and Fringe’s Sherlock 
Holmes booths.
The Andrew Carnegie Boothy for Best Overall 
Booth
The Tartan’s favorite booth overall was Alpha Epsilon 
Pi’s Jurassic Park. All components of this booth were 
put together well, contributing to a structure with 
solid features all around. Not only was the game, 
which involved a gun and dinosaur targets, fun, but 
there were other impressive features like museum 
artifacts that contributed to a learning experience.
The fraternity’s largest “Wow” factor was the real 
Jeep sitting at the bottom of the booth on the way 
out. The room containing the Jeep was a great place 
for photographs and, come on, there was a Jeep in 
a booth! For all these reasons, Alpha Epsilon Phi’s 
booth squeezed out this best-of-booths award.
Conclusion
While the 101st Spring Carnival had some of the 
best booths The Tartan has seen to date, this year’s 
booths were able to compete with the booths 
created for last year’s milestone event.
The booths this year were elaborate with some 
unique structural designs, the likes of which are 
rarely seen. Games were particularly enjoyable and 
the intricacy of the art adorning booth walls lived up 
to previous years.
This year, it showed once again that Carnegie 
Mellon’s students have their hearts in this Spring 
Carnival main event. Here’s to many more years of 
booth, although next year will most likely see booths 
constructed not on the Morewood Parking Lot, but 
in the lot next to the College of Fine Arts.
Will those booths live up to the ones constructed 
in the Morewood lot despite the possible logistical 
challenges of adapting to a new booth location? 
Time will tell, and the fourth annual Boothy Awards 
will be here to dissect those structures.

AB Concert features GRiZ and Dan Deacon
This year’s Carnival artists are renowned for high energy concerts with eclectic electronic sounds
Carnival means much more than shaky booths, underage 
drinking citations, and first-time marijuana experimenta-
tion; it also means great live music. In addition to the 
famed Wilkins Block Party, Carnival is the time of year that 
the Activities Board stages their magnum opus. The past 
thee years have seen performances by Lupe Fiasco, Icona 
Pop and Mac Miller, and RJD2 with Matt and Kim, but this 
year’s artist tops them all: GRiZ with Dan Deacon. While 
there certainly has been a lot of controversy surrounding 
this year’s pick — with some students calling for a more 
“mainstream” pick and everyone upset that the Tepper 
Quad construction has forced the concert indoors regard-
less of weather conditions — those with an uninformed yet 
open mind can be shown that this year’s concert is set to 
sweep them all.
GRiZ
Hailing from the suburbs of Detroit, 25-year old Grant 
Kwiecinski, aka GRiZ, is a certified band geek who gained 
a spirited by DJing parties at Michigan State before drop-
ping out to pursue music full time. His sound can best 
be described as a combination of funk, dubstep, and soul 
music often referred to as electro-soul or future funk. GRiZ 
combines heavy bass grooves with powerful horn lines 
that can get even the stickiest wallflower moving on the 
floor. Over the past few years he’s steadily climbed the live 
music ladder, from opening for artists like Bassnectar, Big 
Gigantic, Datsik, and Pretty Lights to his own headlining 
tour in the fall of 2013 paired with the release of his sopho-
more full-length Rebel Era. Since then, he has launched his 
own record label, All Good Records, to support fellow future 
funk artists and has been awarded by his native Detroit for 
his extensive charity work benefitting the city.
While GRiZ’s studio albums — 2012’s Mad Liberation, 
2013’s Rebel Era and 2015’s Say it Loud, all of which are 
available for free download at mynameisgriz.com — have 
played a big role in his proliferating popularity, it’s undoubt-
edly his incredible live performances that have catapulted 
him from fine print billing to main-stage headliner in only 
three years. Instead of just mixing tracks and asking every-
one to “jump on one…. two… three … GO!”, GRiZ plays 
live saxophone over his songs. Watching him perform is 
more Bruce Springsteen than Deadmau5; he’ll queue a 
track, pick up his saxophone and play until his face is beet 
red, then queue up the next track, rinse and repeat. I’ve yet 
to see an electronic musician work harder on stage than 
GRiZ, and he has recently added the live guitar of Muzzy 
Bear to the show. The two are known to jam and improvise 
over GRiZ’s productions, adding that human “x-factor” that 
is so often missing in live electronic music.
Any heartfelt fan of electronic music, soul music, or music 
in general, will without a doubt have a great time at GRiZ, 
whether or not you’re familiar with his music. He’s not only 
a dynamite performer, but his good-vibes only mantra of 
“Show Love, Spread Love” is exactly what Carnegie Mellon 
needs in these sad times.
Dan Deacon
The Baltimore-based Dan Deacon is a graduate of the 
Conservatory of Music at State University of New York 
Purchase and creates heartfelt electronic music crossed 
with indie rock sensibilities reminiscent of acts like Arcade 
Fire and Passion Pit. When performing live, Deacon con-
ducts not only his impressive array of instruments and 
mixers, but also the crowd itself. The entire room comes 
together at the lead of Deacon, who leads in spiritual medi-
tation and other activities aimed at breaking down personal 
boundaries and bringing the crowd together as one.
Deacon is another electronic musician who employs live 
instrumentation both in his recorded material and espe-
cially in his live show. Anything from multiple drummers 
to guitarists and a self-playing piano are fair game to see 
on stage when Deacon performs, and it’s a testament to 
the incredibly human nature of his music. Don’t sleep on 
catching Dan Deacon at this year’s Carnival, as it will cer-
tainly be a healthy mix of hippie sit-in antics and beautiful, 
love-infused music.

Le Melon: Hearty comfort food at Murray Ave
Local favorite, Murray Ave Grill, serves up warmth in both its food and atmosphere
It’s Sunday night, and you haven’t seen a movie anywhere 
except on the confines of your too-bright laptop screen. 
Your hand reaches for your phone, desperate to find a nice 
theater where you can put your feet up and relish in the 
glory of the big screen. Alas, it’s cold outside, and you’re not 
about to wait for a bus or take an Uber to South Side or the 
Waterfront. Well, there’s always Manor on Murray, folks. It’s 
got student friendly prices, and if you go late enough, crowd 
sizes on the lower end of the spectrum. It’s truly a unique 
experience having a theater almost all to yourself — you 
can laugh as loud as you want and put your feet up. You 
can also eat as much as you want, which for me tends to 
be a problem, for movies distract the part of my brain that 
tells me that I should probably hold off on that next bucket 
of popcorn one. Because of this, I strive to eat a good meal 
before I catch a movie, so the munchies take a backseat to 
the actual movie experience.
Manor is in a local hotspot for restaurants, including a hand-
ful of ones that I’ve reviewed this semester. There’s Thai 
food, Chinese food, Italian food, you name it, and just across 
the street is a local favorite: Murray Avenue Grill. It echoes 
the spirit of South Craig’s own Union Grill, but with a sort of 
small town homeliness that warms up the place.
Every time I eat here, the waiters seem to be well acquaint-
ed with a majority of the customers present, and are always 
incredibly friendly. What’s best? They know the menu well, 
and have yet to let me down with their recommendations.
Favorites:
“Famous” Salmon Burger: This burger is an actual godsend. 
The patty melts in your mouth and is richly seasoned just 
enough to allow the fish to remain the hero of the plate. 
The warmth of the patty is cooled down with a roasted red 
pepper mayo. While the mayo sounds a little odd, its flavors 
compliment the salmon’s incredibly well. The red pepper 
gives an extra edge of body and bite to the mayo, and tastes 
best when spread over the patty as opposed to as a mere 
dip for the sides that come with the burger.
Onion Rings:
The onion rings at this place are huge and fried to perfec-
tion. The onion itself is thick enough to hold when you bite 
into the ring, but also soft and light once it hits your tongue.
Dessert:
Murray Ave has a wonderful spread of desserts, includ-
ing the famous Prantl’s Burnt Almond Torte. I did have the 
pleasure of trying a dessert, which I believe was a chocolate 
cobbler of some sort, that surpassed my expectations by a 
long shot. The dessert arrived in a large glass goblet, like the 
one’s you see giant ice cream sundaes served in in movies. 
It had a thick layer of a chocolate cake of some sort and glo-
rious vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate 
sauce slopped on top. At first glance, it looks like an over-
glorified chocolate sundae, but the flavor is something else. 
I guess the best way to describe it would be a solidified, 
gooey hot chocolate with ice cream. It’s warm, it’s familiar, 
but it’s new at the same time.
“But Apeksha, do they have tea?”
Of course they do, it’s your pretty standard run of the mill 
tea-bag selection. I think the lemon tea washes down 
the salmon really well, and the green tea is always great. 
Everyone should try tea with their dinner at some point or 
another.
Cha-ching:
This place takes cards and cash and is happy to split the 
check on request. The prices aren’t too outrageous consid-
ering the sheer size of the portions. You’ll get your money’s 
worth and have nice a full belly by the end of the meal.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores, lend me 
your ears:
There’s a pretty solid variety, I would say, of vegetarian 
and non-vegetarian. They do have an excellent black bean 
patty burger option for vegetarians that is in a class of its 
own. You can also craft your burger by asking for specific 
toppings, or you can order any of the pre-designed gourmet 
options they have to offer.
Are we there yet?: 
Right across the street from The Manor on Murray Ave. I’d 
take any of the 61’s from campus. If you’re going to Uber or 
walk, head on over to: 1720 Murray Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 
15217
Click, click:
The website’s got a menu, a photo gallery, contact infor-
mation, and other pretty standard features. It’s got a nice 
black and red aesthetic and isn’t too hard to maneuver 
through. Check it out: http://www.murrayavenuegrill.com
For those stay-at-home days:
There’s no delivery straight from the source, but you can 
always use Postmates. They do have takeout though, so 
you can ring in to place an order and pick it up after catch-
ing a movie. Here’s a number: 412-521-1272
21+:
Pretty much a full bar, which is open later than the 
kitchen.
Ambiance:
As was mentioned, the warmth of the establishment is 
infectious and I’ve done everything from grabbing a quick 
bite to working on homework here and it’s always been an 
enjoyable experience.
College student friendly?:
For sure. There’s very much an “everyone is welcome” sort 
of vibe that lingers around the restaurant.
Overall rating: 3 melons

opera
pillbox 04.11.1621
Every so often, we wake from the tedious repetition of 
our lives and, for whatever reason, remember that we 
are at a cutting edge, world class institution. Every 
once in awhile, we become conscious of how proud we 
are to be Carnegie Mellon students. Well, I de?nitely 
had one such moment Saturday night at the School of 
Music’s production of La Calisto, an opera in two acts 
written by the Venetian composer Francesco Cavalli.
The problem with opera, Baroque opera in particular, 
for modern audiences is how dated both the content 
and the style normally tends to be. How are we 
supposed to relate to a piece of music premiered 
in 1651? How are we supposed to be invested in 
the characters and enthralled by the plot, with the 
centuries of progress, war, and political and social 
upheaval that separate them from us? This is the 
challenge that all modern opera directors face: how to 
make us care.
With a cursory reading of the synopsis, we would ?nd 
it hard to imagine that La Calisto was any different 
from the hundreds of other 17th century operas based 
on mythological characters. We have the same lusting 
gods, bashful nymphs, and vengeful goddesses. 
However, from the minute I entered the theater, I knew 
this was not like all those other shows!
Entering the Alumni Concert Hall in the College 
of Fine Arts, my eyes fell on the giant scaffold that 
was to serve as a set. One of the biggest problems I 
have found with modern opera productions is where 
they decide to set the action. Doing faithful period 
productions has almost completely gone out of fashion. 
Rather, directors are trying to transfer the familiar 
action of classic operas to new situations, and in the 
process, make us see them in a new light. This sounds 
?ne until you start having productions where the new 
setting makes absolutely no sense. 
To avoid this trap, La Calisto completely avoids 
the problem by not making any overt references to 
locations or to time periods. The entire action of the 
opera occurs on a construction scaffold, with different 
parts of the scaffold being ?uidly assigned to different 
“settings.” The costumes of the characters range from 
the traditional Roman robes of the nymph Calisto, 
to the tank top and cargo shorts of Mercurio, Jove’s 
servant, to the ripped tights, leather trenchcoat and 
painfully high stillettos of Juno. This lack of an explicit 
setting or time period helped the action of the opera to 
transcend geo-temporal boundaries in a way that really 
drove home the universality of its main theme: sex.
The opera opens with Destiny asking Nature and 
Eternity to immortalize the nymph Calisto in the 
heavens through a constellation. This segues into 
the story of Calisto, a devotee of Diana, goddess of 
chastity, who, through no doing of her own, catches 
the fancy of Jove, the king of the Gods. Even though 
she spurns his advances, he refuses to take the hint, 
resorting, with the help of his servant Mercurio, to 
trickery. Jove takes on the appearance of Diana and, in 
this new form, commands the love of Calisto. 
Meanwhile, Diana is in the middle of her own little love 
affair with a shepherd named Endimione, causing the 
wrath of the minor deity Pan who lusts for her. Pan’s 
henchman Satirino, a lascivious half goat half man, 
tries seducing Linfea, another one of Diana’s devotees, 
who in turn obstructs Endimione’s advances. This web 
of sexual energy woven on stage turns into barbed 
thicket with the entrance of a wrathful Juno with 
her whip-bearing furies. Determined to punish her 
husband’s lover, she turns Calisto into a bear. However 
all is resolved when Jove decides to elevate Calisto 
to the heavens and immortalize her in the form of the 
constellation Ursa Major.
As you can see, this wild romp through the sexual 
underbelly of mythology can satisfy the appetite of 
today’s audiences almost as well as it could back in 
the mid-17th century. In particular, the seduction of 
Calisto by Diana (actually Jove in disguise) was quite 
daring for its time, considering lesbians weren’t really 
accepted back then. On top of all of this, we also have 
the angelic early Baroque music of Cavalli, with its 
seamless transitions from the declamatory recitatives 
and the virtuosic arias. The singing was divine with 
the hardest runs executed almost effortlessly! 
The most memorable aspect however, was the 
acting. Whether it was the banter between Jove and 
Mercurio, the wily cunning of Satirino, Endimione’s 
soulful laments, or Juno’s peacock chatting with the 
orchestra, the opera was ?lled with tiny moments 
showing us that these weren’t cold mummies, dug up 
from the dusty tomb of a long forgotten score. Rather, 
these were living, breathing characters, whose every 
note was a manifestation of a deeper psychological 
phenomenon. 
The entire time I was sitting in the audience, I couldn’t 
help but be amazed at the intelligence, talent, and 
dedication that must have gone into the production. In 
particular, I had to constantly remind myself that the 
gods and goddesses, nymphs and furies on stage were

---------------------------------------------------

As the end of the semester approaches (and no, I do 
not want to think about that), I get more and more 
attached to Madrid. The more I travel, the happier I 
am to come back to my “home base” in Spain’s capi-
tal. I come back to Madrid exhausted and happy to be 
back in “my” bed. 
As much fun as I’ve had in the U.K. or Hungary or 
Morocco, it feels good to be navigating a familiar 
metro system and to know which grocery stores have 
what I need. That’s what I’ve liked about living in 
new places this year – I get to know a city, not just 
visit it.
Since January 2015, I’ve lived in a new place every 
five months; I’ve gotten pretty good at packing and 
unpacking. When I finished my sophomore spring, 
I was nervous and excited to start a series of new 
experiences; now it’s been a year since I finished my 
last semester in Pittsburgh. Over the summer, I lived 
with other interns in Virginia. Last fall, I took classes 
and worked as an intern in Washington, D.C. This 
semester, I feel lucky to be abroad in Madrid. My year 
away is teaching me new things about myself.
My concept of familiarity has changed with my 
time away. I refer to wherever I stay as my home – I 
instinctively say I’m “going home” after class or 
after I get groceries, whether in D.C., Madrid, or 
Pittsburgh. I like the feeling after I’ve learned how to 
use public transport or when I can give someone else 
directions instead of asking for them myself. As I’ve 
become a temporary citizen of several new cities this 
year, each has had its own lifestyle and its challenges.
The challenges seem more evident in Spain, although 
the language barrier is less daunting now than when I 
arrived. I’ve become less self-conscious of my Spanish 
speaking abilities. In order to function, I’ve had to 
coexist with certain insecurities; these include my 
American accent (not as bad as others I’ve heard, but 
still present), my ignorance of Spanish slang expres-
sions, and my Midwestern habit of smiling at people 
on the street (which has a connotation beyond friend-
liness here).
I appreciate the lifestyle here in Madrid. I’m learning 
about the city from my classes, from funny stories 
that my host family tells, and from the times I explore 
on my own. I can walk around the city, meet with 
friends, or take a nice nap. It’s the most relaxed I’ve 
ever felt in college. In Pittsburgh, friends and school 
are intertwined. We all live and work and study in the 
same area, so the separation between school and life 
is practically nonexistent.
I’ve been thinking of Pittsburgh a lot lately. What 
does it mean to be part of a community when I’ve 
been away for so long? I still identify as a Carnegie 
Mellon student. I consider campus to be one of my 
temporary homes.
I felt shaken when I learned of the two suicides on 
campus. Not being in Pittsburgh, I saw the official 
email without opening it right away. Then I started 
seeing posts on Facebook, and I began piecing 
together what had happened. I was heartbroken for 
my community. I reached out to friends, but I didn’t 
have much to say; I told them that my heart was hurt-
ing, that I couldn’t imagine being on campus – that 
I was thinking of them. (All true, but also hollow-
sounding.) For the first time this semester, I wished 
I had another Carnegie Mellon student with me in 
Madrid.
It’s hard to determine whether my perspective has 
changed this year. I suspect that it has, but I don’t 
see evidence of it. I suspect it won’t until I’m on the 
other side, back in familiar territory. For now, though, 
I don’t want to think ahead to re-acclimation. I want 
to do everything I can while I’m still in Spain.

Fast 8, Marvel, and video-game movies make news
Fast 8 gets its villain; Marvel & Sony team up for Spidey reboot; video game movies pick up steam
Charlize Theron Joins Fast 8
The Fast and Furious franchise has been picking up speed 
with recent installments. After the tragic loss of Paul 
Walker, director James Wan delivered Furious 7 with poise 
and respect, without sacrificing the ramped up action 
recent installments have given us. 
Jason Statham’s “Ian Shaw” character has been captured, 
so the door is open for a new baddie to take over. Straight 
Outta Compton and The Italian Job director F. Gary Gray 
has taken over to helm the next film, Fast 8, and Charlize 
Theron has been brought on to give Vin Diesel and the rest 
of the “family” some new challenges. Her official role has 
not been announced yet, but, in a series that trumpets the 
importance of family and friends, it would not be a surprise 
if Theron’s character has some relation to Statham’s.
Uncharted Film Hits The Skids
I wrote an article a while back about the emergence 
of video games getting the big screen treatment and 
the plethora of titles coming down the pipe. With video 
game stories becoming more intricate, characters having 
deeper backgrounds, worlds becoming more detailed and 
beautiful, and gameplay becoming more cinematic, it is 
no surprise studios are lining up to create new big budget 
franchises from these fan favorites. 
Assassin’s Creed is the first major title coming to theaters. 
Coming to theaters on Dec. 21, the film stars Michael 
Fassbender (Steve Jobs, X-Men series). In the end, though, 
we are still talking about Hollywood, where anything can 
happen and good stories can be halted for any reason.
One of the most popular and anticipated titles is 
Uncharted. Game developer Naughty Dog has been 
working with Sony Pictures to develop the script, but 
game director Neil Druckmann had some disappointing 
words on the subject at a recent event for the new 
Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End. In an interview with IGN, 
Druckmann said: “Every once in a while they’ll come in 
and they’ll present to us: here’s the script, here’s what 
we’re thinking. We’ll tell them what we think works, what 
we think doesn’t work … but we haven’t seen anything in 
a while.”
“Our approach is just to steer them back to those 
relationships,” Druckmann added. “The most important 
part to get right is Nathan Drake, Nathan Drake’s 
relationship with Elena and Nathan Drake’s relationship 
with Sullivan. If you don’t get that right, I don’t think the 
film’s going to work. If you get that core right, there’s a 
chance it could work.” It is unclear what the hold up is 
regarding the film, but if the studio is wholeheartedly 
dedicated to getting the character of Nathan Drake correct, 
that may take some time and shows the studio cares 
about delivering a film fans will appreciate. Uncharted is 
currently slated to hit theaters on June 30, 2017.
Marvel Characters Set to Cross-Over in Spider-Man 
Series
It has been over a year since Marvel Studios and Sony 
Pictures announced their historic partnership to “share” 
the Spider-Man character on the big screen. After 
audiences buried The Amazing Spider-Man series under 
harsh reviews, Sony restructured their schedule, hired 
young actor Tom Holland, and partnered with superhero 
film juggernaut Marvel to revive the web-slinger’s 
cinematic story. We have gotten short glimpses of Holland 
as Spider-Man in the trailer for Captain America: Civil War 
but does the door swing both ways? In an interview with 
Entertainment Weekly, Marvel Studios president Kevin 
Feige confirmed, “[Spider-Man] is in the universe now, 
and the fun of the universe is that characters go back and 
forth.” Sony has set their Spider-Man solo film for release 
on July 7, 2017 with Jon Watts (Cop Car) directing with 
Feige and former Sony executive Amy Pascal taking on 
producing roles.

The Big Short
Saturday, April 16
8 p.m.
Director: Adam McKay
Cast: Ryan Gosling (Jared Vennett), Rudy Eisenzopf (Lewis Ranieri), Christian Bale (Michael Burry)
Rotten Tomatoes: 88 percent
The Big Short tells the story of the 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale. Picking up on the 
instability of the housing market, based on the high risk and low return subprime loans being given out, Burry devises an audacious scheme to profit from the impending col-
lapse. Using Burry as a subject, The Big Short provides a deep look into the subprime mortgage crisis and the collapse of 2008. In the process, The Big Short does a spec-
tacular job of informing the viewer about the dangerous economics that led to the crisis, while painting a dirty, if somewhat caricatured, picture of Wall Street greed.

one of the most widely shared scenes from 
Captain America: Civil War’s trailer.
