Weighing the cost of on-campus housing
JUSTIN MCGOWN
Contributing Editor
When it comes to housing 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, after students’ ?rst year, 
two of the most luxurious 
options for those looking to 
live on campus are Webster 
Hall Apartments and Fairfax 
Apartments. While both are 
owned and operated by NDC 
Real Estate Management, 
Inc., Carnegie Mellon leases 
numerous apartments in 
both buildings.
Around half of all apart-
ments in Webster Hall are 
leased to Carnegie Mellon, 
according to Director of Hous-
ing Services Thomas Cooley. 
Each room is equipped with 
air conditioning, a full bath-
room, and complete kitchen 
with a garbage disposal and 
dishwasher. Residents don’t 
have many of?cial communal 
spaces outside of the laundry 
facilities and elevator, but 
each apartment has a decent 
amount of space. The school 
provides cable and Internet 
hookups, but students need 
to bring routers, request a 
cable box, and their own tele-
visions to take full advantage 
of them.
Similar amenities are 
available in Fairfax Apart-
ments. Up to three quarters 
of the apartments in the 
building are leased to Carn-
egie Mellon, meaning that a 
larger portion of the people 
a resident might meet in the 
lobby or elevator are also stu-
dents. Not all of the students 
in these buildings, how-
ever, rent through Carnegie 
Mellon.
Some apartments in both 
buildings are available to 
the general population, in-
cluding students not in the 
housing pool, such as those 
who have already moved off 
campus. Senior creative writ-
ing and professional writing 
double major Elana Goldberg 
is one of those students. She 
and her roommate lived in 
separate sorority houses their 
junior year, but moved into 
Fairfax to live together again 
near campus.
There are certain advan-
tages to renting directly from 
NDC Real Estate. NDC cur-
rently charges $1,245–1,295 
per month for one bedroom 
apartments. Goldberg says 
that she splits this rent with 
her roommate, as well as an-
other $140–150 for utilities, 
including an Internet pack-
age. That comes to a total of 
about $7,225 to rent their 
one-bedroom apartment 
for ten months at a cost of 
$1,295. If she and her room-
mate rented through Carne-
gie Mellon’s housing services, 
Goldberg would pay $9,450 
for the 2014–15 academic 
year, according to rates pro-
vided on Housing Services’s 
website. Next year, housing 
through the university in a 
one-bedroom Fairfax apart-
ment will cost $9,770 for stu-
dents with another academic 
year ahead of them.
There are, of course, ad-
vantages to living in one of 
the apartments leased by 
Carnegie Mellon. Utilities 
and cleaning services are 
included in that price, and 
every room has a full compli-
ment of furnishings, includ-
ing armchairs, coffee tables, 
kitchen tables, and lamps,

Students and activists from 
around Pittsburgh gathered in 
the tent at Schenley Plaza in sub-
freezing weather on Friday as part 
of a rally urging Carnegie Mellon, 
the University of Pittsburgh, and 
the city of Pittsburgh to divest 
from fossil fuels. Carnegie Mellon 
was represented by mem-
bers of Sustainable 
Earth, a student 
organization 
dedicated to promoting green 
practices at the university and in 
the surrounding Pittsburgh com-
munity.
Becca Epstein, sophomore art 
major and co-president of Sus-
tainable Earth, spoke at the rally.
“We are taught again and 
again in our classroom[s] that 
our future is to promote innova-
tion that will change society,” 
she said to the gathered crowd 
as volunteers handed out hand 
warmers and hot chocolate. “But 
by aligning itself with fossil fuel 
companies, CMU is aligning itself 
against innovation.”
In an interview, Epstein said 
that Carnegie Mellon’s stu-
dent divestment move-
ment is still in its 
early phases, 
and is hoping that Friday’s rally 
will kick-start its campaign.
“We’re trying to get student 
support ?rst, so we’ll have a lot 
of signatures and [the admin-
istration] will know what we’re 
asking, and then we’ll start a dia-
logue,” Epstein said. “It’d be re-
ally nice if we could go in and be 
like ‘This isn’t just a crazy group 
of kids, it’s really what your stu-
dent body is asking for.’ ”
Although the petition currently 
only has around 50 signatures, Ep-
stein hopes that by participating in 
Friday’s rally and painting at The 
Fence, Sustainable Earth’s divest-
ment movement can build mo-
mentum. The petition asks Carn-
egie Mellon to divest from the top 
200 companies in support of fossil 
fuel, which include Pittsburgh-
based corporations like the Alu-
minum Company of America, Inc. 
(ALCOA) and Consol Energy, Inc.
Stanford University, as well as 
many smaller universities — in-
cluding College of the Atlantic in 
Maine and Hampshire College in 
Massachusetts — Epstein said, 
have already divested from fos-
sil fuels. “Everyone is trying [to 
divest]; right now is kind of the 
center of the movement. Most col-
leges have a big movement to try 
to get this done.”
When Sustainable Earth start-
ed their petition in November, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Chief Invest-
ment Of?cer Charles Kennedy 
told The Tartan that the univer-
sity’s investments are managed by 
third-party experts who focus on 
growing the endowment: “Assets 
are allocated to investment funds 
managed by third-party experts 
who specialize in particular strat-
egies. We believe this approach 
— with its broad, global diversi-
?cation — will enable the endow-
ment to continue to strengthen 
over time, providing greater on-
going support for the university’s 
operating needs, while preserv-
ing purchasing power to support

“It’s hard to have a con-
versation about the service 
that you do in an everyday 
setting.... How would that 
come up? How would you talk 
about it?”
Minnar Xie, a senior Bach-
elor of Humanities and Arts 
student in art and psychology 
with an additional major in 
human-computer interaction, 
is staying at Carnegie Mellon 
for one more year as a ?fth-
year scholar to answer these 
questions posed by herself and 
make volunteer organizations 
on campus more sustainable.
Xie, along with other mem-
bers of the Partners Allied in 
Civic Engagement (PACE), 
took to the Jared L. Cohon 
University Center on Thurs-
day for the organization’s ?rst 
ever volunteer appreciation 
day.
There, members handed 
out cookies and hot choco-
late while visitors wrote why 
they volunteer on Post-it notes 
and had their pictures taken 
dressed in clothing represent-
ing their respective organiza-
tions. PACE describes itself 
as a collaboration between 
students and staff to increase 
civic engagement on campus.
Elizabeth Vaughan, direc-
tor of student activities and 
staff representative for PACE, 
said that the event was in-
tended to both celebrate the 
service contributions that 
campus members make and 
increase the visibility of vol-
unteering on campus.
Campus members from 
various organizations, such 
as Facilitating Opportunities 
for Refugee Growth and Em-
powerment (FORGE), Jun-
tos, Alternative Spring Break, 
Habitat for Humanity, and 
1000plus, are now part of a 
photo campaign on PACE’s 
Facebook page, which Xie 
said is also intended to raise 
awareness.
“Service is for some reason 
a weird vacuum where you 
can’t talk about it, because it’s 
not an everyday conversation 
piece,” Xie said.
PACE was created to bring 
together the campus’s various 
service organizations through 
updates, resources, and 
PACE’s own events, including 
one-time service and philan-
thropy events, the university’s 
Volunteer Fair, discussions 
with nonpro?t leaders, ?lms, 
and blood drives.
PACE is composed of six 
steering committee mem-
bers, including an intern, 
campus relations chair, edu-
cational programming chair, 
a currently vacant marketing 
chair, and two ?rst-year rep-
resentatives, as well as staff 
representatives. 
Xie is the committee’s 
campus relations chair, while 
Vaughan and Kristine Kengor, 
coordinator of student life and 
housefellow for the Residence 
on Fifth, are the organiza-
tion’s staff representatives.
There are currently 36 
recognized activist groups 
on campus, and PACE had a 
subscriber list of 1,604 emails 
prior to its appreciation day.
During the 2012–13 aca-
demic year, over 5,000 stu-
dents contributed 297,438 
hours to service activities, 
according to information pro-
vided by Judy Hallinen from 
the Leonard Gelfand Center 
for Service Learning and Out-
reach, a PACE partner that 
works to improve educational 
opportunities.
Vaughan said that these 
statistics do not represent the 
full breadth of volunteering 
on campus, as they represent 
the hours of groups that are 
easiest to capture, but not in-
dividual volunteer hours.

STUDENT SENATE MEETING MINUTES
Finance Committee update
Finance Committee gave a 
presentation to Senate on ?s-
cal policies and the funding 
of student activities. It was 
noted that currently almost 
half of student organizations 
are of?cially unrecognized by 
the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC), and that the current ap-
proval rating of special alloca-
tions is currently 54 percent of 
the target 61 percent. The ini-
tiative to create the webpage 
funding.cmu.edu was also 
presented, where all fund-
ing sources on campus can 
be displayed and searched. 
Additionally, the committee 
discussed the goals of creating 
a book of precedents and best 
practices, as well as increasing 
transparency between the ad-
ministration and the student 
body. 
Last year the Finance Com-
mittee spent all but $4,000 of 
its special allocation money, 
with the goal of spending all 
of the money available for 
these allocations. 
Special allocation: CMU in Haiti
The CMU in Haiti service 
group sought funding to send 
14 students and one faculty 
member to Haiti for a service 
project. This new group re-
ceived $1,000 in allocations 
from the JFC, as is practice for 
new organizations, but due to a 
travel advisory is unable to col-
lect more funds. When asked 
about the risk to students, the 
organization’s leader present-
ed that one out of 150 people 
had been medically evacuated 
in the past four years, so while 
risk is present, it is minimal. 
Senate voted to allocate fund-
ing to this organization.
Special allocation: Senior Events Committee
Committee update: Academic affairs
Student Activities’ Senior 
Events Committee sought ad-
ditional funding from Senate 
to hold events for members of 
the senior class. Because this 
money carries the possibility 
of reducing ticket prices for 
their events and the ability to 
create a feeling of community 
for seniors during their ?nal 
weeks at Carnegie Mellon, 
this funding was approved.
After one year of work, the 
Academic Relationship Code, 
which aims to formalize the 
way professors and students 
communicate with each other, 
has been completed. The Aca-
demic Affairs Committee is 
talking with the study abroad 
of?ce in an attempt to make it 
easier to schedule semesters 
abroad for students. There is 
also work being done with re-
spect to reducing stress culture 
across campus.

all beyond the standard resi-
dence hall compliment of 
desks and beds.
“There’s new furniture in 
a lot of spaces,” Cooley said 
of the rooms in Fairfax. The 
school pays for the replace-
ment and repair of all that 
furniture, and there is a regu-
lar turnover. “Every mattress 
[in Fairfax] was swapped 
out over the summer.... We 
spent a good month moving 
furniture.”
Regular repairs and up-
grades to the apartments, es-
pecially larger and more costly 
ones, are part of the reason 
for the higher university costs, 
said Cooley. 
In Fairfax alone, 20 kitch-
ens are going to be upgraded, 
and the plumbing in an entire 
vertical “stack” of rooms will 
also undergo refurbishment. 
The bathrooms in the building 
mostly date back to Fairfax’s 
original construction in the 
1930s.
“Pro?t margins on those 
spaces are very low,” Cooley 
said of the higher rent on 
the Carnegie Mellon leased 
rooms. “We don’t lose money, 
and we don’t break even,” he 
continued. “But the majority 
goes to covering the leasing. 
We pay the utility overhead 
cost, and facilities staff.” The 
money is almost entirely spent 
on running and improving stu-
dent housing, Cooley said.
He also mentioned the ben-
e?ts of cleaning services for 
students living through uni-
versity arrangements.
Eric Pederson, a senior bio-
logical sciences major, lives 
in Webster Hall Apartments, 
located across the street from 
the Mellon Institute where he 
does most of his work. He, for 
one, really appreciates these 
services. 
“CMU’s Housing policies 
are usually pretty easy to live 
with, based on my own expe-
riences. They’re fairly easy to 
work with when it comes to 
quick day-to-day issues like 
lost keys or maintenance re-
quests.”
Pederson will pay $9,450 
($9,770 in 2015-16 ) for this 
academic year spent in a 
one-bedroom Webster Hall 
Apartment. According to the 
NDC Real Estate’s website for 
Webster Hall Apartments, the 
most expensive one-bedroom 
units go for $1,350 per month. 
If Pederson and his roommate 
split the NDC rent two ways 
for ten months, Pederson 
would pay close to $7,500 if 
his utilities and Internet bills 
cost roughly what Goldberg’s 
do.
Pederson said that he 
wouldn’t mind paying less for 
his room, but he appreciates 
the simplicity of only having 
one bill to pay.
“It makes it easy to do less 
paperwork,” he said, and add-
ed he wouldn’t want to try go-
ing it alone. “I think it’s a very 
attractive option for some 
people, especially if you’re on 
a tight budget, but it’s not for 
me.”
Cooley said that in addi-
tion to furnishings and a siz-
able full time support staff 
including Resident Assistants, 
security provided by Carnegie 
Mellon’s police department, 
and a maintenance staff con-
sidered to be very responsive 
by students, there was one 
thing in particular that draws 
students to their units. “The 
big advantage is I provide stu-
dent life. You don’t get that on 
your own.”
However, Goldberg doesn’t 
feel like she is missing out on 
that advantage. “Maybe [it’s] 
because I’m a senior and over 
it, but I don’t miss that. As a 
sophomore or a junior, you 
might want that ... but as a se-
nior it’s kind of like you want 
to be out of that loop of ?oor 
meetings and [mandatory] 
activities.”
Through savvy shopping 
and knowing students who 
graduated previously looking 
to get rid of their own furni-
ture, Goldberg says that her 
and her roommate were able 
to furnish their apartment for 
no more than $1,000. Accord-
ing to my?rstapartment.com, 
a complete set of Ikea furnish-
ings for a small apartment can 
be had for $1,800.
Even using $1,800 as the 
cost of furnishings in com-
bination with an estimated 
rent and utilities fee in line 
with Goldberg’s, the rate for 
a one bedroom apartment in 
Fairfax with two people shar-
ing the rent, comes to a cost 
of $9,025 this year using the 
$7,225 price point for Fairfax 
if only one person pays for all 
furnishings. Carnegie Mellon 
charged $9,450 for 2014-15.
When it comes down pure-
ly to price, renting through 
NDC instead of Carnegie Mel-
lon offers a pricing advantage 
to students. 
Still, for underclassmen, 
losing the sense of community 
and the support staff provided 
by living in Carnegie Mellon 
leased apartments may have 
a larger impact than it did for 
Goldberg, and many students 
could deprive themselves of 
an important part of the col-
lege experience.
Editor’s Note: The ten-
month rent period for students 
not renting through the univer-
sity was chosen as an equivalent 
time during which students in 
on-campus housing live in their 
apartments. Total costs for the 
entire year would be greater 
than for the proposed 10-month 
period for students living in the 
apartments not through the 
university if they do not sublet 
during the summer months.
future generations of stu-
dents, faculty, and programs,” 
Kennedy said at the time. 
Kennedy could not be reached 
for comment.
Among the other speak-
ers at the rally was Gabriel 
McMorland, new economy 
campaign organizer for the 
Thomas Merton Center, an or-
ganization dedicated to social 
justice in Pittsburgh that is pe-
titioning the city of Pittsburgh 
to divest from fossil fuels.
“This is not the time to be 
investing in those fossil fuel 
companies and to be invest-
ing in the fossil fuel industry,” 
McMorland said. “They still 
think they’re a good invest-
ment, but the only reason 
they’re continuing with their 
business plan is because they 
believe we can’t muster up 
the political power to enforce 
real regulations that protect 
people and the environment.”
Pastor Robert Wilson of 
the First United Method-
ist Church of Pittsburgh and 
representatives from orga-
nizations such as Pennsylva-
nia Against Fracking and the 
Earth Quaker Action Team of 
Pittsburgh also spoke at the 
rally, covering issues ranging 
from divestment to fracking 
and mountain strip mining. 
Andrew Woomer, a student at 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
spoke on behalf of the Fossil 
Free Pitt Coalition, a group 
of student organizations peti-
tioning the University of Pitts-
burgh to divest from compa-
nies that support fossil fuels.
Matthew Powell-Palm, a 
senior mechanical engineering 
major and member of Sustain-
able Earth, said that the divest-
ment movement at Carnegie 
Mellon, once it has heavy stu-
dent backing, will work with 
the university’s Green Prac-
tices Committee and approach 
the administration.
“The nice thing about di-
vestment is that it can hap-
pen on a ton of different levels 
that are equally impactful,” 
Powell-Palm said. “So maybe 
it starts with, say, the MechE 
department divesting. While a 
large part of it is real and eco-
nomic — and you are leverag-
ing actual power when you 
move money — a large part of 
it is also symbolic, saying that 
by removing our money we’re 
removing our nominal sup-
port of the fossil fuel industry 
and development of the fossil 
fuel industry.”

KRUTI KOPPOLU
Junior Staffwriter
The biggest challenge stu-
dents at Carnegie Mellon face 
can be summed up in one 
sentence: There are a mil-
lion things to do, but never 
enough time to do them all. 
Most students do not even 
realize just how busy they 
are. Brittany McCandless (DC 
‘08) was one of these students 
who was too busy to notice 
that she was too busy.
McCandless, an associa-
tive producer for CBS Eve-
ning News, graduated from 
Carnegie Mellon in 2008 with 
a bachelor’s degree in profes-
sional and creative writing 
and a minor in international 
relations and politics. During 
her time at Carnegie Mellon, 
she was both an Orientation 
Counselor and Head Orienta-
tion Counselor, news editor 
for the Tartan, and a member 
of the Lambda Sigma honors 
society. She also led a Girl 
Scout troop in Squirrel Hill 
and a newspaper adviser for 
Sterrett Classical Academy. 
Needless to say, McCandless’ 
plate was always full.
During a late night discus-
sion with her best friend about 
campus culture, McCandless 
realized that being busy had 
become a competition. In her 
words, “You couldn’t just do 
one thing. Your worth as a 
student and thereby a per-
son was based on how busy 
you were.” McCandless’ talk, 
“Does Busy Mean Better?”, 
hosted by the Carnegie Lead-
ership Consultants(CLC), was 
born from what’s infamously 
referred to as the “I got less 
sleep than you did” game or 
“competitive complaining.”
Last Friday McCandless 
gave her talk to an audience of 
students and faculty alike. She 
discussed the environment at 
Carnegie Mellon, delved into 
the student psyche and nar-
rated personal experiences, 
including showing everyone 
her college planner that she’s 
kept since she graduated from 
Carnegie Mellon. Following 
her talk, student leaders fa-
cilitated a workshop, in which 
students were grouped to-
gether to share their opinions 
and experiences.
In her talk McCandless 
displayed statistics that show 
a rise in percentage of stu-
dents being affected by the 
competitive nature being 
associated with business, 
especially among ?rst-year 
students. Studies conducted 
by the University of Califor-
nia Los Angeles indicate that 
over the past ?ve years, the 
number of freshmen who feel 
overwhelmed by the need to 
be busy has risen from 27 per-
cent to 34 percent.
Jivika Mangwani, a ?rst-
year Psychology major, can 
attest to that. “I personally 
feel like it does affect fresh-
man a lot, especially as an in-
ternational student. It’s a new 
vibe and you’re just ?guring a 
college out, and then you see 
all these people ‘busy’ doing 
so much.”
These topics were delib-
erated on at length during 
the workshop segment of the 
event and provided students 
with an array of varying per-
spectives that elicited a posi-
tive response. “I thought that 
Brittany provided a very im-
portant perspective to our 
campus’ students in a way that 
was incredibly relatable,” said 
senior chemical engineering 
major and group discussion 
facilitator Evan Starkweather. 
“She managed to discuss a 
very serious topic with humor 
and grace. It was refreshing. I 
also thought that the discus-
sion afterward was a really 
nice way to help start a dia-
logue within our community.”
During an interview, Mc-
Candless credited Carnegie 
Mellon for her success, de-
spite her rigorous college life. 
“Being in this environment 
meant being surrounded by 
brilliant, engaged minds who 
were very into the things they 
did. This produced an energy 
and excitement that inspired 
me when I was here and that 
I carry with me today,” Mc-
Candless said. “I have a base of 
knowledge which I can work 
with on a daily basis because 
of the people from various dis-
ciplines that I interacted with, 
and this is very valuable. “
McCandless urged stu-
dents not to make the same 
mistakes she did to get the 
most out of their college ex-
perience, telling them that 
“Busy is not a badge of honor. 
It is not a status. Be ef?cient 
with your time and allow 
yourself the time to relax.”

Brittany McCandless (DC ’08) shared her experiences at Carnegie Mellon and the value of not overworking, 
but rather taking time for yourself.
In previous years, Xie 
travelled to Guatemala with 
Alternative Break and to Ni-
caragua with Juntos, an or-
ganization whose members 
travel to the same commu-
nity, Rosa Grande, year after 
year with aims to improve 
the community’s situation 
through targeted initiatives. 
She was also president of 
FORGE last year, through 
which she has created ties 
with a Bhutanese refugee 
family, the Khanals, in Pitts-
burgh since her ?rst year at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Next year, she will focus 
her ?fth-year scholar proj-
ect on ways that PACE can 
further provide for volun-
teer organizations. Xie said 
that, through multiple con-
versations, she found that 
many organizations have 
problems that mirror the 
problems of nonpro?ts, in-
cluding disorganization and 
a lack of funds and time.
She aims to create re-
sources housed within PACE 
that student leaders can use. 
Although her research and 
conversations with leaders 
will determine her focus, 
she believes she will provide 
resources for organizational 
improvement, event plan-
ning, or ?nancial needs so 
that they can become even 
more sustainable, as well as 
visible, in the future.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
It seems that everyone and their 
mother took a trip this weekend to 
see the hotly-anticipated movie ad-
aptation of E.L. James’ erotic best-
seller Fifty Shades of Grey.  As of Sun-
day, the movie had made over $81.7 
million at the box of?ce.
However, contrary to its block-
buster status, the movie’s reception 
has been less than positive. IMDB 
gives it a 3.9 out of 10 stars, while its 
Rotten Tomatoes average falls in at 
26 percent. 
While plenty of people doubtless 
saw Fifty Shades “ironically,” and 
hardly expected it to have cinematic 
merit, the intensely problematic na-
ture of the book and now the movie 
cannot be ignored, especially consid-
ering the massive popularity of both.
Fifty Shades broke taboo and 
brought erotica to the mainstream 
in a huge way. Had Fifty Shades em-
powered women’s sexuality more 
than it romanticizes domestic abuse, 
The Tartan would stand behind it in 
support. 
Unfortunately, Christian Grey is a 
textbook abuser dressed up like “The 
Dream Guy,” and his egregious be-
havior toward Anastasia is excused 
by virtue of them being in a contrac-
tual, ostensibly consensual bondage 
and discipline, dominance and sub-
mission, and sadism and masochism 
(BDSM) relationship.
However, real-life BDSM 
communities have continually spo-
ken out against James’ novel, calling 
it grossly misrepresentative. The cen-
tral motto of BDSM is “safe, sane, and 
consensual,” and Christian and Ana’s 
relationship is none of those things. 
Christian stalks Ana, abandons her 
after potentially-traumatizing sexual 
experiences, and takes control of 
her life to the point of alienating her 
from family and friends. Fifty Shades 
paints Christian Grey as an ideal, 
when in reality, women should take 
one look at him and speed-walk in 
the other direction.
Many Fifty Shades fans have de-
fended it from criticism with the 
phrase “it’s just a book/movie.” 
However, no ?ction exists in isola-
tion; movies like Fifty Shades spread 
erroneous, harmful ideas to very 
real people. Someone intrigued by 
this falsi?ed version of BDSM could 
get themselves hurt. Someone could 
also be trapped in an abusive rela-
tionship, thinking their abuser is 
someone they should want. In the 
words of Jamie Dornan, who plays 
Christian Grey: “Mass appreciation 
doesn’t always equate to something 
good. Think of Hitler!” Fifty Shades 
has more baggage than its erotic fa-
cade implies.

Fifty Shades is a hundred shades of controversial
Urban Out?tters’ clothes not worth its bad practices 
Social media makes ISIS more credible, bigger threat
Last week Urban Out?tters re-
ceived a request from the Anti-Defa-
mation League to remove a tapestry 
from its stores which resembles the 
garb of gay prisoners in Nazi concen-
tration camps.
The design — white and gray 
stripes with pink triangles — is not 
the ?rst of Urban Out?tters’ to in-
voke imagery of the Holocaust. In 
2012, a yellow shirt with the Star of 
David on the breast pocket was remi-
niscent of the yellow patches Jewish 
citizens were forced to wear in Nazi 
Germany. 
This most recent offensive de-
sign joins a long list of controversial 
products which have been released 
and subsequently pulled from Ur-
ban Out?tters stores. Urban Out?t-
ters has produced several question-
able products in the past, including 
a vintage-style Kent State University 
sweatshirt with red, blood-like spots 
and racist knockoff Navajo-labelled 
products that violate trademarks 
held by the Navajo nation. 
Other examples of bad taste in-
clude shot glasses shaped like pill 
bottles, shirts that encourage an-
orexia, and a “Ghettopoly” board 
game. There have also been accusa-
tions against Urban Out?tters for 
stealing designs from individual 
artists.
Given the organizations’ history 
of distasteful choices, it seems to pur-
posefully create products that lead to 
headlines and publicity without ac-
tually selling. The vintage Kent State 
sweatshirt, for example, only sold a 
single unit. These stunts have cre-
ated a successful business model — 
free advertising and notoriety have 
promoted the brand, not harmed it.
Customers are either unaware or 
do not care about the ethics of the 
business they support. The teens 
who buy from Urban Out?tters are 
more concerned with cheaply-made, 
fashionable items than ethical ones.
Customers, however, need to 
show discretion. The Tartan does not 
support the business practices of Ur-
ban Out?tters, but the chain has no 
incentive to change their ways with-
out a clear message from consumers. 
Some of this responsibility must fall 
to the individuals who shop there — 
or those who no longer will.
Last Tuesday, Kayla Mueller, the 
last known American hostage of ISIS, 
was killed. ISIS claimed that she was 
killed by a collapsing building after a 
Jordanian air strike. Coincidentally, 
ISIS also claims that no militants 
within its ranks were killed.
ISIS has little interest in ?ghting 
America. It is more focused on physi-
cal battles with Bashar al Assad and 
other ?gures in the Middle East who 
ISIS considers apostates for not ad-
hering to its particular set of views.
However, ISIS does need support 
in the hearts and minds of people 
in its region. It is extremely dif?cult 
to change the religious structure 
of a region while burdened by the 
unpopularity that comes with con-
quering land, displacing thousands 
of people, and miscellaneous atroci-
ties. The easiest way for a group to 
regain popularity is to de?ne itself 
in opposition to an even less popular 
group. In this case, ISIS has identi-
?ed the United States government as 
its target.
This is where the story of Muel-
ler becomes troubling. ISIS’s account 
of her death is hard to believe. They 
claimed she was the sole occupant of 
a three-story weapons warehouse. 
ISIS is not stupid; they almost cer-
tainly would not allow a hostage into 
a weapons warehouse unsupervised. 
However, much of the discourse sur-
rounding this story seems to impli-
cate Jordan, not ISIS, in the death of 
Mueller. ISIS has crafted a media im-
age for itself so powerful that it con-
trols its own narrative. This should 
not be possible for one of the world’s 
most hated political entities. 
Much of this stems from ISIS post-
ing unedited video of their brutal ex-
ploits, including vicious executions. 
These gave ISIS’s internet persona 
an air of honesty. This extends into 
ISIS’s interactions with Mueller, as 
the publicly-released parts of its cor-
respondence with her family were 
disarmingly cordial. ISIS claimed its 
members treated Mueller as a guest 
rather than a hostage.
Still, it is dangerous to give much 
weight to a single organization’s 
claims. ISIS needs to withstand a 
much more critical lens than they 
are currently being subjected to by 
American and international media.
Abandon partisanship for healthcare solution
KYLE HENSON
Lawmakers are preparing for the 
Supreme Court’s ruling on King v. 
Burwell, the latest court challenge to 
the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that 
could severely change the way the 
ACA functions. I wrote about this 
challenge at length a few months 
ago, but in sum, the case may disal-
low the IRS from issuing subsidies in 
about two-thirds of states that didn’t 
set up exchanges. If the court rules 
against the administration, the rul-
ing would cripple the ACA and ne-
cessitate changes to the way the law 
functions.
Republicans recently met to 
come up with a plan to replace the 
ACA, and announced a plan that 
was largely a watered-down version 
of the ACA that would never get 
past Obama’s veto pen. I’d like to 
challenge lawmakers to come up 
with a practical solution that actu-
ally solves the problems facing the 
healthcare system and has the po-
tential to get past Obama’s veto.
Healthcare is a unique problem 
because it creates market anomalies. 
Pricing people out of the care that 
they need is not an option in any de-
veloped society, but creating a blank 
check for all of the healthcare peo-
ple could possibly want will increase 
demand, and therefore prices, to an 
unsustainable point that leads to 
rationing. This is happening in the 
overwhelming majority of Great 
Britain’s hospitals, with a lot of mon-
ey being wasted on unnecessary pro-
cedures and checkups that consume 
what is becoming a very scarce sup-
ply of medical resources.
A good healthcare system creates 
an ef?cient allocation of resources, 
where everyone is getting the care 
they need, and money isn’t being 
wasted on unnecessary care. The 
key to this kind of ef?cient system 
is to use market incentives that dis-
courage people from consuming un-
necessary resources, like going to 
the emergency room for a stomach 
ache. Additionally, it is important to 
have a non-market catch-all in the 
instances when market incentives 
wouldn’t work, like when someone’s 
arm gets broken and they can’t shop 
around for care.
There are a few ways to do this, 
all of which have positive and nega-
tive aspects. A simple solution would 
be for the government to reimburse 
doctors for procedures and their 
time at a ?xed rate for a speci?c 
procedure and then to have a cost-
sharing mechanism in place where 
consumers would pay a ?at fee of say 
$50 or $100 so that people lack the 
incentive to overuse subsidized care.
Another option would be for the 
government to completely cover 
catastrophic care and leave things 
like routine checkups to the market. 
This system runs into issues of de-
termining what is catastrophic care 
and what isn’t, which is very tricky, 
but which pales in comparison to the 
pitfalls of both the ACA and the pre-
ACA healthcare system.
Health savings accounts are a 
great way for the government to 
cost-share. One potential system 
would allow people to save their 
money tax-free, speci?cally for 
healthcare. They could save up to 
$5,000 or so in this account, and if 
they spent more than that in a year, 
the government would cover the dif-
ference. This is the same premise of 
a high deductible health insurance 
plan, which works pretty well in 
most cases.
What all of these solutions have 
in common is that they are both 
more ef?cient than the ACA and 
more liberal, giving the government 
more responsibility over people’s 
care. 
Unfortunately, the political situ-
ation is so broken that this type of 
solution is the only practical alterna-
tive to replacing the ACA in the event 
the Supreme Court rules against the 
bill. I’d love to see Republicans and 
Democrats alike cast aside parti-
sanship, throw around ideas bigger 
than Washington’s echo chamber, 
and create a bipartisan healthcare 
solution that expands coverage and 
reduces costs.

What did we do to deserve such subzero temperatures?

Don’t be bitter on V-day, embrace love that is everywhere
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Operations Manager
A month ago, I couldn’t wait for 
Valentine’s Day. I had an amazing 
boyfriend, it was our ?rst V-day to-
gether, and I was going to buy him 
a nice new wallet — since I had ac-
cidentally put his old one through 
the laundry. It would be so romantic 
because we were so in love. 
Then, out of nowhere, he broke 
up with me. I was completely devas-
tated. My heart was crushed, and I 
thought that my Valentine’s Day was 
ruined. I went through alternating 
phases of moping, ignoring that any-
thing was wrong, and harassing his 
friends. That lasted for almost two 
weeks.
Then I had an epiphany, an im-
portant part of any good story. It 
came on a Thursday night when I 
was driving my Big home from Greek 
Sing rehearsal. Ed Sheeran’s disgust-
ingly cute love song “Thinking Out 
Loud” came on the radio, and my 
?rst instinct was “DEAR GOD TURN 
IT OFF,” as I had been avoiding any-
thing remotely romantic at absolute-
ly all costs. 
Then, some foreign instinct awoke 
in me, one that I had never really 
known before. It whispered to me: 
“Gutie, don’t be so bitter.” I whispered 
back: “Ew, no thank you.” But this 
weird little cupid on my shoulder 
insisted, and I yielded. I thought to 
myself, “Ed Sheeran is truly a god.” 
Instead of changing the station, I 
kept listening to the song, and even 
though I didn’t have anyone to sing it 
to me, it didn’t make the song any less 
beautiful.
Think about how many people 
out there have the kind of love that 
Ed Sheeran loves to sing about. You 
can see it everyday, all around you: a 
couple holding hands on their way to 
class, your parents or grandparents 
or aunts and uncles, strangers shar-
ing dinner in a restaurant.
When you’re single, it’s so easy to 
look at all of that mushy gushy love 
and let it get to you. It’s easy to be 
jaded and to give up. What’s hard is 
to see love and recognize how amaz-
ing it is. 
But when you let yourself take on 
that perspective, it’s actually hard to 
be bitter. I’m only twenty. I have my 
whole life ahead of me to ?nd love 
(or conversely, to be bitter about it). 
Seeing so much love in the world 
gives me hope that I won’t be watch-
ing from the sidelines forever. One 
day, when all the stars align, I’ll ?nd 
the love that’s meant for me.
But just because I’m choosing 
not to be bitter does not mean that I 
won’t be sad. I’m not entirely through 
with sorting out all of my hurt feel-
ings, and to deny myself that time I 
really do need would be just as big of 
an injustice to myself as having a bad 
attitude would be. I’ve decided that 
it’s okay for me to be sad, but it’s not 
okay for me to let it take over my life.
So, for the time being, I’m going 
to keep surrounding myself with all 
of my friends who love me, and mak-
ing sure that I keep seeing the value 
in the special kind of love that only 
friends can give. It’s not the same as 
romantic love, but it’s just as amaz-
ing. To my friends, who know who 
they are, I wouldn’t have made it to 
this place if it weren’t for any of you. 
I’ll always love you for helping me see 
my own worth.
My parents mailed me a Valen-
tine’s Day card this week. The inside 
says: “Today is all about matters of 
the heart ... and you totally matter to 
mine.” 
In addition to being adorable and 
making me feel appreciated, it made 
me realize that this holiday is for ev-
eryone, not just couples. I don’t need 
to have a boyfriend to be allowed 
to celebrate! This year, I’m going to 
make sure all the people in my life 
know how much they’re loved, and it 
will be just as special.
I have so many more Valentine’s 
Days left in my life to spend with a 
boyfriend or a husband. I’ve made 
the choice for myself and my own 
happiness not to waste this precious 
time dwelling on the possibilities that 
will only make me miserable. I’m go-
ing to embrace the love that I have 
and be happy for all the people in the 
world who have been lucky enough 
to ?nd love, too.

The week has seen the emer-
gence of several narratives in the 
media characterizing the relation-
ship between Apple and Tesla. These 
are the two most glamorous compa-
nies in Silicon Valley, and arguably 
the world; thus, people tend to sit up 
and take notice when a ?ood of sto-
ries headlined “Apple” and “Tesla” 
are unleashed in a matter of days.
Furthermore, several of these 
stories seem to be at odds with one 
another. On the one side, Forbes says 
that Tesla has poached 150 people 
from Apple, in order to further ex-
pand into consumer electronics. 
Business Insider, on the other side, 
says that Apple has poached people 
from Tesla in order to build an elec-
tric car of its own.
Apple and Tesla have always tra-
ditionally avoided each other, hold-
ing a grudging respect for the other’s 
dominance in their respective ?elds. 
It seems as if the two companies 
are ?nally getting into each other’s 
crosshairs. Why is this happening 
now? And what does this mean for 
the industry as a whole? 
The San Francisco Chronicle re-
ported that last Spring, Apple’s chief 
of mergers & acquisitions Adrian 
Perica met Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 
Such a high-level meeting suggests 
Apple was interested in buying, or 
at least getting involved in a major 
partnership, with Tesla. Elon Musk, 
in a later interview with Bloomberg, 
did not deny having spoken to Apple 
about an acquisition. Needless to 
say, nothing was announced, in-
dicating that whatever was being 
planned fell through.
Automobiles are a massive mar-
ket, arguably the only consumer 
market larger than cellphones. Fur-
thermore, even a minority market 
share at the high end can lead to an 
enormously pro?table business. For 
evidence, consider BMW, Mercedes, 
or Jaguar-Land Rover — all highly 
pro?table players that thrive on 
good design and a small number of 
extremely loyal customers.
Right now, everyone in that seg-
ment is worried about Tesla, the 
young scrappy American upstart 
that is only poised to grow as electric 
car charging facilities become more 
widespread. If reports are to be be-
lieved, soon they may also have to 
worry about Apple, which is one of 
the largest companies in the world 
and the only one with the design 
chops to outclass even Tesla.
According to the Wall Street 
Journal, Apple has hundreds of em-
ployees working on an electric car 
project meant to compete directly 
with Tesla. And when did this proj-
ect start? Approximately a year ago, 
around the time Apple’s Perica met 
Musk, to no avail. For this project, 
Apple has poached experts from a 
variety of automakers, including 
Tesla.
On the other side of the fence, 
Tesla is trying to ramp up produc-
tion. With the imminent arrival of 
its budget option, the Model 3, Tesla 
needs to scale its supply chain very 
quickly. Apple is famous for a sup-
ply chain that is as massive as it is 
ef?cient. It would only be logical 
for Tesla to want to poach some of 
Apple’s talent in the ?eld.
Apple and Tesla are both exam-
ples of vertically-integrated, design-
centric, high-margin success stories 
born in the Silicon Valley. All said 
and done, the entrance of both in 
the auto industry should hopefully 
shake things up for the better.

The United States has every 
reason to be proud of its medical 
advances. Over the course of ?ve 
decades, the government-funded 
system has managed to decrease in-
stances of various deadly diseases 
such as Hepatitis A and B, tuberculo-
sis, and mumps to a mere 0.5 percent 
from a mighty average of 14 percent.
These statistics are one of the 
many reasons why the United States 
has retained its place as one of the 
world’s superpowers. Its medical 
infrastructure forms an impressive 
model, one which many developing 
countries are either eager to emulate, 
or are in the process of emulating.
You may ask how exactly a nation 
with such divided religious views 
and beliefs managed to curb the 
spread of these diseases a good two 
to three decades ago, while several 
other nations are still struggling to 
cope with ever-increasing instances 
of life-threatening diseases.
Well, it’s all credited to the 
healthcare system, which initially 
mandated the vaccination and im-
munization of kids and adults alike 
against various life-threatening dis-
eases. However, there existed certain 
sections of society that weren’t very 
happy with this turn of events. They 
were, and with excusable reasons, 
still are unhappy to let go of their op-
tion not to get vaccinated.
The above-mentioned section of 
society forms an extremely insig-
ni?cant portion of the population, 
but nevertheless an important one. 
While some understandably object-
ed to vaccination for religious rea-
sons, newer anti-vaccination groups 
claim that they don’t want their kids 
to develop autism as a side-effect, 
they believe, of vaccination.
This fear was born in the early 
’90s, when a study claimed that a 
certain chemical used in vaccines 
to preserve the immunization trig-
gered internal underlying conditions 
within a developing child, inducing 
autism. While it scared a lot of par-
ents away from medicine, nearly two 
decades of exhaustive research has 
since invalidated the claim and the 
paper from which it originated, de-
claring there to be no connection at 
all between vaccination and autism.
However, the word of several 
well-renowned scientists, research-
ers, and doctors — not to mention 
the World Health Organization and 
the Institute of Medicine — doesn’t 
hold much weight at all when it 
comes to the likes of Republican New 
Jersey governor Chris Christie.
Late this January, in a pre-Super 
Bowl interview with NBC’s Savan-
nah Guthrie, Obama urged Ameri-
can parents to get their children fully 
vaccinated, in an attempt to be cau-
tious amid growing concerns over 
the recent Disneyland outbreak of 
measles, a highly contagious disease.
On the other hand, Christie is of 
the opinion that parents should have 
“some measure of choice” in vacci-
nating their children. Christie claims 
that he supports vaccinations and 
believes they’re extremely important 
to maintain public health. 
However, he believes it’s his re-
sponsibility to “stand with” families 
affected by autism, “in their ?ght for 
greater parental involvement in vac-
cination decisions that affect their 
children,” according to The Huf?ng-
ton Post.
While some may believe the gov-
ernor’s stance to be oh-so-noble, 
what a lot of people and the gover-
nor himself fail to envision is the 
number of people he’d have to “stand 
with” if even a few, seemingly insig-
ni?cant, citizens refuse to get vac-
cinated. But how can an educated 
politician such as Christie support 
“choice” on vaccination, based only 
on the incorrect assumption that 
vaccines are indeed a plausible cause 
for autism? The only clear motif that 
emerges is that Christie was attempt-
ing to depict vaccination as a parti-
san issue, establishing a Republican 
stance on an issue clearly founded on 
people’s fears and not on hard medi-
cal evidence.
If this is the case, Christie should 
be ashamed. Not only is he elevating 
peoples’ fears and doubts regarding 
vaccines, where none should exist, 
but he is also endangering American 
society at large. 
As Obama mentioned in his NBC 
interview: “If you have a certain 
group of kids who don’t get vacci-
nated, and if it grows large enough 
that a percentage of the population 
doesn’t get vaccinated and they’re 
the folks who can’t get vaccinated, 
small infants, for example ... they 
suddenly become much more vul-
nerable.”
Our only hope now is that gover-
nors and politicians such as Christie 
realize the sensitivity of topics such 
as vaccination before distorting 
them with partisanship. 
Next time, the governor should 
make use of his power and position 
to tell the people what they really 
need to know, instead of using the 
opportunities to further his own po-
litical agendas.

SCITECH BRIEFS
Earliest fossils of ancestral mammals discovered
Two newly discovered fos-
sils of ancestral mammals help 
demonstrate the possibility 
of a wide range of ecological 
diversity in early mammals. 
The two fossils, Agilodocodon 
scansorius and Docofossor 
brachydactylus, were discov-
ered in northeastern China 
and belong to creatures called 
docodonts, an evolutionary 
group that diverged from the 
mammalian branch and be-
came extinct. 
Agilodocodon, which lived 
around 165 million years ago, 
had curved claws on its hands 
and feet to climb trees, and its 
limb proportions are similar to 
those of modern-day animals 
that live in trees. Paleontolo-
gists have found that its teeth 
are most suited for a diet of 
tree gum and sap. 
Docofossor, which lived 
around 160 million years ago, 
had shovel-like ?ngers for dig-
ging and teeth that suggested 
it foraged underground. Its 
proportions are strikingly 
similar to the modern African 
golden mole. 
The dating on the fossils 
suggests they coexisted with 
the dinosaurs.
Papers regarding the fossils 
were published independently 
in Science on Feb. 13 by inter-
national teams of scientists 
from the University of Chicago 
and Beijing Museum of Natu-
ral History.

Alan Turing’s code-breaking papers released
The notes of Alan Turing, 
a mathematician who played 
a key role in breaking the 
German Enigma code dur-
ing World War II, were found 
in Bletchley Park, Britain’s 
code-breaking center. The 
papers were found stuffed 
inside holes in the ceiling of 
Hut 6, Turing’s workplace; 
Turing and his team appeared 
to be using them as draught 
excluders.
The notes were discovered 
in 2013 during a multimil-
lion-dollar restoration project 
of Bletchley Park in Milton 
Keynes, Buckinghamshire, 
and they were recently re-
leased to the public. 
Amongst the notes were 
“Banbury sheets,” long sheets 
of paper with holes punched 
in them to compare different 
ciphers. Turing used these 
Banbury sheets to speed 
up the decryption of Nazi 
messages.
“Discovering these pieces 
of code-breaking ephemera 
is incredibly exciting and pro-
vides yet more insight into 
how codebreakers worked,” 
Bletchley Park Trust chief ex-
ecutive, Iain Stander, said in a 
statement. 
The notes, along with oth-
er artifacts found at Bletch-
ley Park, will be displayed 
in a new exhibition called 
“The Restoration of Historic 
Bletchley Park” in Hut 12.

Late-night screen time alters body’s natural clock
A new study from Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital in Bos-
ton, Massachusetts shows that 
individuals who read off of a 
screen such as an iPad before 
sleeping have a more dif?cult 
time going to sleep and wake 
up feeling groggier than indi-
viduals who don’t.
The study consisted of six 
male and six female volun-
teers in their mid 20s who, 
for a two-week period, alter-
nated between reading off of 
iPads and printed books four 
hours before a bedtime of 10 
p.m. each night. The research-
ers found that subjects took 
nearly ten minutes more to fall 
asleep, and spent less time in 
rapid-eye movement (REM) 
sleep, after reading on iPads 
than they did when they were 
reading printed books. They 
also took longer to become 
alert in the morning, which 
could result in negative effects 
in the real world.
Exposure to light at night 
disrupts the body’s internal 
clock by suppressing melato-
nin, a hormone used as a sleep 
aid, so the study’s results are 
consistent with what experts 
would expect. Some experts 
did note that using a bright 
light while reading a paper 
book could have the same ef-
fect.  The researchers reported 
their ?ndings January 27th in 
the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

Eight million tons of plastic dumped in ocean yearly
A groundbreaking study 
published in Science this week 
quanti?es how much garbage 
?ows into the world’s oceans 
every year. Previously, scien-
tists estimated how much gar-
bage was in the ocean by tak-
ing sample counts of plastic on 
the surfaces of large garbage 
patches in each of the world’s 
oceans. A study last year esti-
mated the amount of ?oating 
trash to be 245,000 tons at 
most.
This study, lead by Jenna 
Jambeck, an Environmental 
Engineer from the University 
of Georgia, combines popula-
tion and economic data from 
192 coastal countries border-
ing the Atlantic, Paci?c, and 
Indian Oceans in addition to 
the Black and Mediterranean 
Seas to show that, of the 245 
million tons of garbage ac-
cumulated by these countries 
annually, 4.8 to 12.7 million 
tons of plastic ?ows into the 
oceans. 
The study also names the 
top twenty countries gener-
ating the most ocean-bound 
trash; China is ?rst, and the 
United States is twentieth.
Since the gap between 
plastic ?oating on the ocean’s 
surface and plastic ?owing 
into the ocean is so wide, sci-
entists now have to ?gure out 
where else it is collecting and 
in what amounts in order to 
close the gap.

First stars in the universe born later than thought
New maps from the Euro-
pean Space Agency’s satellite, 
Planck, revealed “polarized” 
light from the early Universe.
Previously, scientists deter-
mined how old the Universe 
was by examining the Cosmic 
Microwave Backgroud (CMB) 
fossil light remaining from a 
time when the Universe was 
hot and dense after the Big 
Bang. Planck studied this light 
in great detail between the 
years 2009 and 2013.
“After the CMB was re-
leased, the Universe was still 
very different from the one 
we live in today, and it took a 
long time until the ?rst stars 
were able to form,” explains 
Marco Bersanelli of Università 
degli Studi di Milano, Italy. 
“Planck’s observations of the 
CMB polarisation now tell us 
that these ‘Dark Ages’ ended 
some 550 million years after 
the Big Bang – more than 100 
million years later than pre-
viously thought.” While 100 
million years seems negligible 
compared to the Universe’s 
age of almost 14 billion years, 
it makes a signi?cant differ-
ence when it comes to the for-
mation of the ?rst stars.
This new data has many 
effects besides an understand-
ing of when the ?rst stars were 
formed. It could lead to dis-
coveries regarding dark mat-
ter, neutrinos and the stucture 
of the Galactic magnetic ?eld.

Protein treatment ?ghts Alzheimer’s symptoms
A recent paper published 
in the Journal of Neuroscience-
by lead author Dena Dubal 
discusses how manipulating 
the protein levels associated 
with memory can delay Al-
zheimer’s symptoms. Dubal, 
Assistant Professor of Neu-
rology from the University of 
California, San Fransisco, and 
her team work with klotho, a 
transmembrane protein asso-
ciated with longevity.
Previous research indicated 
that increasing klotho levels in 
the brains of healthy mice also 
increased cognitive function. 
Dubal’s team then increased 
klotho levels in the brains of 
mice who also expressed large 
amounts of amyloid-beta and 
tau, proteins associated with 
the onset of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Her team found that, 
even with these toxic proteins, 
the mice with elevated klotho 
levels were able to retain cog-
nitive function.
The team says that they 
would need to further inves-
tigate the mechanism behind 
this cognitive preservation 
before it is possible to treat hu-
mans in the future.
The next stages of this re-
search involves identifying 
and testing drugs that affect 
klotho levels or are able to 
simulate klothos effects.

“Climate change is a seri-
ous concern, and we should 
be doing everything with 
can to mitigate it. In the 
case where mitigation is not 
possible, we must adapt,” 
said Paulina Jaramillo, as-
sistant professor of Engi-
neering and Public Policy 
(EPP) at Carnegie Mellon. 
Jaramillo and her team of 
researchers were recently 
awarded a grant from the 
National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) to identify the 
risks of climate change on 
infrastructure. Their hope is 
to identify ways to mitigate 
that risk in hope of devel-
oping a sustainable energy 
system. 
In recent years, increased 
governmental funding and 
global awareness has lead 
to strides towards reducing 
our carbon footprint and de-
creasing our dependence on 
non-renewable resources. 
Despite this, humans con-
tinue to release carbon into 
the atmosphere and due to 
its long half life, it will re-
main in the atmosphere for 
a significant time. As carbon 
becomes more abundant in 
the atmosphere, the earth’s 
climate with respond ac-
cordingly, leading to ex-
treme weather events such 
as heat waves and droughts. 
These changes have the 
potential to negatively im-
pact the current energy in-
frastructure. 
Jaramillo is the lead in-
vestigator on a project that 
will focus on power systems 
in the southeastern United 
States to identify and miti-
gate this risk. She explained 
that climatologists predict 
that drought will increase 
and water availability will 
impact precipitation pat-
terns in the area.

CMU hosts Idea [Space] Competition

Graduate students from various disciplines participated in the CMU Idea [Space] Competition to develop inventive ideas to solve current world issues.

Since its founding in 1900, 
Carnegie Mellon University 
has become home to seven 
independent colleges with 
esteemed programs rang-
ing from the sciences to the 
?ne arts. Yet even with the 
availability of interdisciplin-
ary programs, many Carn-
egie Mellon students ?nd it 
hard to branch out of their 
college. At the same time, 
the solutions to many real-
world issues — from climate 
change to educational gaps 
— require the use of skills 
that span disciplines.
This issue helped to cre-
ate the vision behind CMU 
Idea [Space], a competition 
that started last Friday and 
lasted through Sunday. In 
its ?rst year, the competi-
tion brought together many 
Carnegie Mellon graduate 
student participants, repre-
senting all seven schools, as 
well as numerous judges and 
volunteers. The event was 
designed so that participants 
had the opportunity to meet 
new people, particularly stu-
dents from different colleges.
Prior to the competition, 
participants were given the 
chance to submit problem 
statements for the competi-
tion on Reddit, which served 
as an online voting system. 
After a reception and lecture 
at the Posner Center, locat-
ed in the Tepper School of 
Business, those participants 
had the chance to present 
their problem statements to 
the entire group. Groups of 
participants from different 
colleges were formed based 
on the ideas that had inter-
ested them most. Over the 
weekend, members of groups 
collaborated in creating a so-
lution that incorporated mul-
tiple disciplines. Students 
were also allowed to receive 
help from mentors and other 
outside sources, provided 
that they do their own work.
“I want people be cre-
ative,” said Alex Brown, a 
master’s student in business 
administration, who served 
as the founder and lead co-
ordinator of the event. “We 
don’t provide any guidelines 
on what the deliverable 
needs to be, which could be 
anything from an mobile ap-
plication, to a mock toy, to a 
powerpoint presentation.”
Kera Bartlett, a fellow 
MBA student, was asked by 
Brown to the project man-
ager of the event. “I think it’s 
very important to be open 
minded and realize that you 
have one way of looking at 
an issue or a problem. Your 
way may be very different 
from the views of people on 
your team,” Bartlett said. 
“So it’s also important to 
not get too attached to your 
perspective.”
In fact, the challenges in 
facilitating such collabora-
tion between students of dif-
ferent programs was what 
Alex had in mind for the 
event.
“One of the things that 
I’ve worked on while I was a 
president was trying to ?gure 
out ways for Tepper School 
of Business kids to develop 
relationships with other 
schools,” Brown continued. 
“I realized, during the pro-
cess, that other schools had 
similar concerns or similar 
experiences as Tepper.”
In the past, Brown was 
awarded two grants from the 
ProSEED Crosswalk, a Carne-
gie Mellon program designed 
to encourage development 
of ideas in their early stages. 
“One of the grants was for 
developing a new competi-
tion with the objective to 
bring graduate students clos-
er together,” said Brown. “So 
once the grant was approved, 
I started planning and just 
last year I developed a team 
to for the event. We decided 
what would be the best thing 
to work on, and we started 
throwing ideas out of how it 
would work.”

HOW THINGS WORK
Money prints in a complex process
SHAOJIE BAI
Staffwriter
How is money made to-
day? Why does money have 
that distinctive “dollar smell”? 
Why does a $1 bill feel differ-
ent from normal paper? Many 
people have pondered these 
questions, but few actually 
know the answers. Currency 
circulation is a critical part 
of a country’s economy. The 
U.S. dollar (USD), an interna-
tionally recognized currency, 
plays an especially important 
role in people’s daily lives. Yet 
the question remains: Who 
prints money, and how?
The Bureau of Engraving 
and Printing (BEP), part of 
the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury (DOT), is one of 
the largest currency printing 
operations in the world. It 
was founded in 1862, when 
currency was printed and 
separated by hand-cranked 
machines, but modern tech-
nology has enabled a far more 
ef?cient and secure way to 
do this. The notes have been 
redesigned over the past de-
cades so that they not only re-
tain the traditional American 
look and feel, but also contain 
an increasingly sophisticated 
portrait watermark and a 3-D 
security ribbon to prevent 
counterfeit notes in circula-
tion.
The ordinary paper that we 
use for printers or newspapers 
is made of wood pulp. Pulping 
breaks down the bulk struc-
ture of the ?ber source into 
constituent ?bers, a desired 
attribute for papermaking.  
The thick ?ber board can then 
be shipped to a paper mill for 
further processing. 
However, the paper and ink 
used in the production of USD 
bills is as distinct as its design. 
Currency paper is speci?cally 
made for the BEP by Crane Pa-
per Company (Crane & Co.), 
and is composed of 75 percent 
cotton and 25 percent linen. 
This three-to-one ratio is one 
of the most important reasons 
for the unique look and feel of 
the dollar bill. Currency pa-
per also sports its own unique 
ink. All bills utilize green ink 
on their backs and black ink 
on the faces. All the inks ap-
pearing on U.S. currency are 
specially prepared, formu-
lated and blended by the BEP 
itself. To ensure security and 
quality, the BEP implements 
continuous testing on the ink 
and paper.
The design of currency is 
less mysterious than it seems. 
The designers at the BEP usu-
ally develop many versions of 
the overall look of the paper 
currency before one of them 
gets approved by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury. Many 
factors go into the design of 
paper currency, one of which 
is whether the design incor-
porates a digni?ed image to 
properly re?ects the strength 
of the American economy.
The most complicated part 
of printing currency is the off-
set printing operation, which 
allows for indistinct back-
ground colors to improve the 
security of the bills. First, the 
photo engraver must dupli-
cate the images from the de-
signers over a plate layout. A 
high-resolution ?lm recorder 
separates colors onto differ-
ent sheets of ?lm in negative 
form. A thin sheet of steel 
with a light-sensitive polymer 
surface is then covered with 
the ?lm and exposed to UV 
light. This process must be 
absolutely accurate; the in-
trusion of even a single dust 
particle can affect the overall 
printing quality, in which case 
a new plate will be manufac-
tured. Each background im-
age has a seperate plate. In 
the next stage of offset print-
ing, the background colors 
are printed by the huge 50-
feet long, 70-ton Simultan 
presses. The sheets of paper, 
after printing, are stored to 
dry for 72 hours.
After offset printing comes 
the engraving process. This is 
an important part of printing 
currency because this is where 
the designer’s sketches will be 
transformed into 3-D engrav-
ings. All elements of a note, 
like portraits and vignettes, 
must be engraved on separate 
steel dies, a type of manufac-
turing mold. Individually en-
graved elements on steel dies 
will subsequently go through 
siderography, where multiple 
elements are transferred to a 
single printing plate, which is 
then given to plate makers to

On Charles Darwin’s 206th 
birthday, Pugwash attended 
a Humanist League lecture 
where science writer Chip 
Walter discussed human evo-
lution. Evolution was very 
controversial during Darwin’s 
era. Like all novel discoveries 
that contradict pre-existing 
ideas, the theory of evolution 
offended many people, par-
ticularly those whose religious 
beliefs led them to believe in 
creationism: the theory that 
God created the earth and hu-
man existence in seven days. 
However, the theory perse-
vered through the decades.  
The ?rst question Walter 
answered was, “Why are we 
here?” There have been 27 
recorded species of human on 
the planet since its creation. 
However, the only species 
to survive was Homo sapiens 
sapiens, humans as we know 
them today. Many people be-
lieve that today’s humans are 
the result of a long chain of 
evolutionary development 
that spans several species. Ar-
istotle called this the “chain 
of being” where each species 
did not have contemporaries, 
but led to the next, more de-
veloped set of humans. There 
is evidence today to prove this 
is not true. In fact, different 
human species competed for 
much of their existence result-
ing in Homo sapiens coming 
out on top. 
What is even more strange 
is that Homo sapiens were 
neither the strongest nor the 
smartest human species dur-
ing a time in which others 
existed. There is suf?cient 
evidence to suggest that 
Neanderthals were larger and 
had larger brains. However, 
human nature supported the 
formation of small groups that 
were good at communicating, 
which meant that the group 
could survive as a whole. Wal-
ter proposed that the most im-
portant invention of human-
kind is the symbol. Humans 
are unique in that we are good 
at communicating with one 
another, and symbols — such 
as art and characters — al-
low people to express their 
thoughts in even more ways. 
Walter then stressed the 
importance of the discovery 
and study of evolution. Not 
only does it allow us to learn 
about our past, but it can help 
us make advances in the fu-
ture. Knowing how humans 
developed communication, 
creativity, and emotions is 
vital to understanding how 
to improve our future. Hu-
mans are capable of complex 
thoughts, and Walter em-
phasized that we should use 
this ability to learn from our 
mistakes and see how we can 
improve humanity as a whole. 
Walter also pointed out that 
traces of Neanderthal and 
other extinct human species 
remain in our genes, which 
shows that evolution is still 
affecting us in the modern 
world.
Despite hundreds of years 
of research into evolution, cre-
ationism and anti-evolution 
theories are taught in public 
schools. Walter stressed that 
learning about the history 
of evolution is important in 
understanding who we are 
today. Do people who reject 
the theory of evolution have 
an enormous gap in their edu-
cation? Should we cease the 
teaching of creationism and 
similar theories, or do we give 
people the freedom to believe 
what they want to despite 
overwhelming scienti?c proof 
that their theories are incor-
rect?

By collaborating with 
researchers at the hydro-
climatology center at the 
University of Washington, 
Jaramillo believes that this 
unique partnership will pro-
vide insight into the risks 
posed by climate change. 
She proudly expressed how 
rare it is to see hydroclima-
tologists working with pow-
er systems engineers and 
credits the interdisciplinary 
culture at Carnegie Mellon 
for encouraging her and her 
colleagues to expand be-
yond their discipline. 
In addition, the team 
will be collaborating with 
experts on water infrastruc-
ture management at George 
Washington University. 
After developing models 
of the components and con-
straints of the current power 
system, the team hopes to 
use their hydroclimatology 
expertise to shock the system 
and understand its effects. 
The availability of water 
can impact the energy pro-
duction by hydroelectric 
dams and also the cooling 
methods used at thermal 
and nuclear power plants. 
Their models will allow 
them to test a variety of 
scenarios without having to 
directly impact a functional 
system that provides power 
to hundred of homes and 
businesses. 
Jaramillo’s previous 
work involved the affects 
of renewable resources on 
infrastructure. She believes 
that these methods of ener-
gy production can serve as 
a mitigation strategy since 
wind and solar technolo-
gies do not depend on water 
availablility. 
In addition to mitigating 
risk, Jamiillo explained that 
their project “includes a so-
cial science component that 
involves many stakeholders 
and identifying how they 
perceive the risk and their 
plan to manage it moving 
forward.” 
Stakeholders include, 
but are not limited to, pow-
er plant operators, grid op-
erators, investors, and asset 
owners, some who Jara-
millo stated “may not even 
be thinking about the risk 
involved.”
The project recently 
received its funding and 
expects to be drawn out 
over the next three years. 
Jaramillo and her team of 
researchers aim to report 
their findings in peer-re-
view journals as well as at-
tend conferences to share 
their results directly to 
many of the stakeholders. 
Many of her team mem-
bers are involved with the 
United States Association 
for Energy Economics (US-
AEE), which plans to have 
its annual North American 
Conference in Pittsburgh 
this year. 
Jaramillo believes that 
with regard to infrastruc-
ture, the general public re-
lates to bridges that were 
built years ago. Identifying 
how to maintain them si 
currently a hot topic. Con-
versely, energy infrastruc-
ture has a much smaller 
lifespan, and with the im-
pact of new legislation, 
many power plants and 
similar structures will soon 
become outdated. 
Thus, in addition to 
maintaining the current in-
frastructure, “the growing 
demand leads to the oppor-
tunity for new assets,” she 
said.
By analyzing the risk in-
volved, Dr. Jaramillo and 
her team hope to determine 
and devise the most strate-
gic plan to mitigate the risk 
as the energy sector evolves 
and expands into a future 
clouded by the risk of cli-
mate change.

The plastic master is sprayed

currency with a speed 10,000 
sheets per hour. The sheets 
are then allowed to dry for 
72 hours, after which they 
are separated for further pro-
cessing (like face printing, 
which is followed by another 
72-hour drying period).
 After the printing is com-
plete, the rest of the process 
involves examination and 
inspection. The Upgraded 
Of?ine Currency Inspection 
System (UOCIS) will use 
computers, cameras and so-
phisticated software to ana-
lyze the untrimmed printed 
sheet and monitor its color 
and ink density.
Upon the completion of 
the above, the dollar bills are 
in perfect shape. They are 
now ready for distribution, 
the ?nal stage of production. 
They are transported for 
packaging and shipped to the 
Federal Reserve Bank. The 
completed loads are securely 
stored in the Federal Reserve 
Vault so that they can be dis-
tributed by the Federal Re-
serve Bank in the future.

before February, including 
over winter break. Throughout 
those months, Brown was able 
to ?nd like-minded students 
from Tepper’s two-year MBA 
program to help tackle the proj-
ect, including Bartlett. 
Despite a tight deadline, the 
planning team was able to ?nd 
sponsors that were eager to 
support their goal. These spon-
sors helped to fund the mon-
etary prizes for the top three 
teams. In addition, UpPrize, 
a collaboration between BNY 
Mellon and the Forbes Fund, 
provided a million dollar incen-
tive, which would be awarded 
sometime after the event, for 
a team that was serious about 
taking their projects to the next 
level.
“If some of the fruit-
ful projects come from our 
competition, they can turn 
into something that becomes 
materialized down the road, 
because of the partnership we 
developed with our sponsors,” 
Brown explained. Some of the 
judges also came from these 
sponsors, including Matt Zieger 
of the Forbes Fund, who served 
as a guest speaker and judge.
On the last day of the event, 
participants could continue 
working on their project un-
til the submission deadline of 
11:30 a.m. After lunch and an-
other guest speaker, the teams 
had the chance to bring their 
projects to the spotlight. Dur-
ing the presentations, judges 
scored the team based on how 
innovative and holistic each so-
lution was.
The event produced a wide 
range of interesting projects. 
One of the teams mapped a 
way for cheap and highly ef-
?cient renewable energy to be 
generated from garbage and 
land?ll waste. Max Kiefer, who 
was one of the members of the 
team, had actually submitted 
the idea on Reddit. Kiefer stud-
ies environmental science in 
the Mellon College of Science.
“Initially I had developed 
the idea beforehand, for my 
company. Some of the initial 
challenges were ?nding ways 
to create energy from toxic and 
pollutant gases. Also, we had to 
?gure out what we were going 
to do with the gases after they 
have been used for energy pur-
poses” explained Kiefer.
With the knowledge and 
problem-solving skills that each 
problem statement demanded, 
many participants had found 
the event to be a meaningful ac-
ademic and social experience.
A mother as well as stu-
dent at Tepper, Jin Zhang was 
able to bring her passion of 
improving math education to 
the event. Although her group 
had only two members, Zhang 
and Garrett Hemann, also from 
Tepper, it won third place. They 
advocated for the improvement 
and increased availability of 
apps and toys that would help 
children start learning math 
before preschool. 
“The result of this event 
was fabulous. Everyone prob-
ably worked day-and-night. 
For me, the event helped me to 
network with people, and shop 
my idea.” said Jin. “This event 
was also a great way for me to 
see the ideas that other people 
had.”
A Heinz College student, 
Pavneet Singh Kochhar, and 
his team worked on creating 
automated cleaning and main-
tenance of solar panels, which 
often accumulate dust that re-
duce the ef?ciency of its func-
tion. 
“It was a good learning op-
portunity for all of us.” said 
Kochhar. “It gives us an oppor-
tunity to mingle with differ-
ent people from all over cam-
pus. You could be here for six 
months, and still not know so 
many people.”
With the enthusiasm of 
this year’s participants, it’s no 
wonder that the organizers of 
the event intend on continuing 
CMU Idea [Space] next year, 
with plans of having having 
some of the current partici-
pants join the planning team of 
2016.
 “It’s a fun way to spend the 
weekend,” Bartlett said. “It’s 
very intellectually challenging 
and it stretches our comfort 
zones in terms of working with 
people from a lot of different 
backgrounds.”

NFL coaching carousel spins in aftermath of Super Bowl
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
As each season comes to a 
close, NFL coaches ?y around 
the league’s sidelines as teams 
attempt to ?nd a new face to 
manage their personnel. This 
year was no different, as seven 
teams will begin the 2015 sea-
son with a new head coach. 
The various hires are listed 
here from worst hire to best.
Denver Broncos: Gary 
Kubiak 
Most recent job: Offensive 
Coordinator (OC), Baltimore 
Ravens; Career wins-losses as 
a head coach: 61–64
This hire is somewhat con-
fusing. The Broncos might be 
preparing for a future without 
quarterback Peyton Manning 
as we once knew him, but 
none of the Bronco’s person-
nel is proven in Kubiak’s zone 
blocking scheme, and the 
team was built to pass any-
ways. The Broncos’ success 
waned rapidly as they shifted 
to a running-focused attack at 
the end of last season, culmi-
nating in a playoff loss to the 
vastly inferior Indianapolis 
Colts. Now they hired a coach 
who is known for his running 
strategy and not much else. 
This hire is just confusing.
Chicago Bears: John Fox 
Head Coach (HC), Denver 
Broncos; 118–89
John Fox clearly has a 
knack for developing defen-
sive talent, which makes him 
quite a good ?t with Chicago’s 
barren roster in a vacuum. The 
Panthers and Broncos teams 
both improved vastly on de-
fense every season with him at 
the helm. The problem here is 
with John Fox on the sideline: 
he is absolutely atrocious as 
a game manager. He consis-
tently makes needlessly con-
servative play calls that have 
cost his teams high pro?le 
games (re-watch the Broncos 
vs. Ravens playoff game from 
2013 and try not to cringe as 
Fox attempts to run the clock 
out rather than have Peyton 
Manning try for the win). He 
is a mess with the timeouts, of-
ten burning them to do things 
like ice kickers rather than 
strategically stop the clock 
or substitute players on the 
?eld. Fox also tends to chal-
lenge at horrible moments, 
seemingly throwing his chal-
lenge ?ag the ?rst two times 
he disagrees with a call rather 
than waiting for high leverage 
moments with lots of yards 
involved where winning the 
challenge might actually mat-
ter. Given this Bears’ team’s 
defensive woes, John Fox was 
probably a decent hire, but not 
a good one.
San Francisco 49ers: 
Adam Tomsula 
Defensive Coordinator (DC), 
San Francisco 49ers
This is a sensible hire. It is 
unfortunate that we don’t get 
to see Jim Harbaugh’s creativ-
ity and exquisite abilities for 
player development in the 
NFL anymore, but his relation-
ship with the front of?ce broke 
down so publicly and uncom-
fortably that a change was 
probably necessary. 
Tomsula is a solid defensive 
coordinator, consistently de-
veloping talent and putting 
together a string of successful 
seasons. Many of the players 
who leave the 49ers defense, 
such as Buccaneers safety 
Dashon Goldson and Browns 
safety Donte Whitner, go 
?ame out on lesser teams, so 
he seems to understand how 
to maximize a player’s talent. 
We know nothing about his 
offensive acumen, and histori-
cally there is a learning curve 
for coordinators in their ?rst 
head coaching job. However, 
hiring in-house means there 
will be some continuity and 
there’s certainly potential for 
this decision to look very good 
very quickly.
Atlanta Falcons: Dan 
Quinn 
DC, Seattle Seahawks
There are certainly things 
to like about Quinn’s head 
coaching potential. He is a 
fantastic play caller, and has 
a plethora of signature games 
to point to if one questions his 
defensive strategies, includ-
ing Super Bowl XLVIII. This 
has the potential to be a great 
coaching hire, since the Fal-
cons have some defensive tal-
ent in players like cornerback 
Desmond Trufant, just not 
enough to build a functional 
NFL defense. The Falcons will 
improve vastly if Dan Quinn is 
merely a bad coach, as former 
head coach Mike Smith had to 
be the worst tactician in the 
NFL, constantly blowing ev-
ery single opportunity he had 
to change the game from the 
sidelines. The problem here 
is that Quinn succeeded with 
a very speci?c team building 
style in Seattle. Atlanta does 
not have close to a similar 
roster. Quinn will presumably 
continue to be excellent from 
the sidelines, but it’s possible 
that his schemes may be an 
awkward ?t for a year or two.
New York Jets: Todd 
Bowles 
DC, Arizona Cardinals
Todd Bowles just turned 
in a season for the ages with 
Arizona. Defensive talent 
dropped like ?ies, as the Car-
dinals were probably at less 
than 50 percent strength for 
most of the season. However, 
for the ?rst ten weeks of the 
year, Bowles ran one of the 
three best defenses in the 
league. This shows schematic 
?exibility and a keen eye for 
reaction. While the Jets have 
not had a functional offense 
since quarterback Brett Fa-
vre spent a year in green, the 
defense was actually a big-
ger problem last year. There 
is absolutely no talent on the 
roster defensively outside of 
defensive linemen Sheldon 
Richardson and Mohammed 
Wilkerson. Bowles’s success 
with unfamiliar faces could 
help rebuild the defense, mak-
ing it much easier to create an 
offense.
Oakland Raiders: Jack Del 
Rio 
DC, Denver Broncos; 68–71
The future in Oakland is… 
bright? Jack Del Rio does not 
get enough credit for how 
great of a job he did in Jack-
sonville. If it weren’t for an 
unfortunate injury in week 17 
to quarterback David Garrard, 
Del Rio would have reached 
the playoffs in three consecu-
tive years with the moribund 
franchise. 
Del Rio managed to build 
top ten defenses nearly every 
year there, and the offenses 
were functional if not great. 
People forget how great those 
2007 Jaguars were, and that 
at halftime it felt like they 
might topple the mighty and 
undefeated Patriots. The 2005 
Jaguars were a great team as 
well, and these squads always 
seemed as if they were teeter-
ing on the precipice of some-
thing great while producing 
tons of productive players in-
cluding players with very little 
pedigree before entering the 
NFL.  This bodes well for Oak-
land, which has a fairly young 
core of talent.
Now, Del Rio, who is par-
ticularly good at coaching 
linebackers, will have young 
linebackers Khalil Mack and 
Sio Moore under his tutelage. 
Both are among the NFL’s 
most productive linebackers 
despite being very unpolished. 
There’s no reason to believe 
Del Rio can’t turn that raw tal-
ent into superstardom. Add in 
his success at turning medio-
cre talents like Garrard into 
decent contributors, and there 
is potential that Del Rio can 
turn quarterback Derek Carr, 
who was better than most 
give him credit for in a bumpy 
rookie season, into something 
special.
 Del Rio could take this 
franchise in the right direction 
for the ?rst time in over a de-
cade.
Buffalo Bills: Rex Ryan 
HC, New York Jets; 46–50
Ryan really got the short 
end of the stick at the Mead-
owlands. He was scapegoated 
as a reason for the Jets’ offen-
sive woes, and his boisterous-
ness with the media got him 
publicly labeled as a distrac-
tion. Of course, neither of 
these things make sense. Ryan 
was largely frozen out of per-
sonnel decisions, and he never 
even had an average team. The 
two Jets teams he dragged to 
the AFC Championship Game 
were mediocre squads at best, 
optimized by Ryan’s defensive 
schemes. 
Ryan catches lots of ?ak 
for not being able to develop 
a Jets’ franchise quarterback, 
but it is hard to see his options 
approaching that label. For 
what it’s worth, quarterback 
Mark Sanchez was slightly 
more productive in New York 
than he was under supposed 
quarterback guru Chip Kelly in 
Philadelphia. Don’t let Ryan’s 
record fool you: an average 
coach would probably top out 
at six wins per year rather than 
eight with the talent Ryan was 
given, and this year’s Jets team 
might’ve been one of the least 
talented in league history. 
This Bills team in particular, 
however, is a much better ver-
sion of the 2010 Jets Rex Ryan 
coached so successfully. 
A more talented run game 
and defense will help disguise 
the lack of a solid quarterback, 
as will wide receiver Sammy 
Watkins, who is very talented. 
Ryan’s hire is exciting for an 
improving Bills team.
SPORTS BRIEFS
Men’s Basketball
Friday night, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s basketball team 
traveled to Brandeis Univer-
sity as they continued their 
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) conference play. 
Despite coming off of a strong 
home stand where the men 
went 2–0, the Tartans fell be-
hind in the opening minute 
and never fully recovered as 
they went on to lose 68–57.
After a 3 pointer by sopho-
more forward Jack Serbin 
cut the lead back to 2, keep-
ing the Judges from pulling 
too far away in the opening 
minutes, Brandeis went on 
10–0 run with the next Tartan 
basket not coming until half 
way through the period with 
a layup by sophomore center 
Chris Shkil. From there Carn-
egie Mellon was able to ?ght 
back and keep the game close, 
cutting the de?cit to 3 before 
a Judges’ 3 pointer pushed the 
halftime differential to 6.
In the second half the Tar-
tans kept ?ghting and the 
game to single digit. With 
just over 8 minutes to go in 
the game, senior guard Seth 
Cordts had a chance to tie the 
game with a three pointer but 
couldn’t connect. After the 
miss and ensuing 3 points by 
Brandeis, the Tartans were 
never able to get it back to a 
one possession game, and with 
the Judges making their free 
throws down the stretch while 
the Tartans were chucking up 
desperation 3s, the de?cit bal-
looned back to double digits. 
Serbin lead the team with 18 
points while Cordts and Shkil 
both had double digit contri-
butions.
The loss dropped Carnegie 
Mellon to 3–7 in UAA play and 
12–9 on the season. 
The Tartans played New 
York University on Sunday. 
They will return home for 
their ?nal home stand starting 
Friday against Rochester at 8 
p.m.
Track & Field
While the rest of campus 
was enjoying a wintry Valen-
tine’s Day, the Carnegie Mel-
lon men’s and women’s track 
and ?eld teams were compet-
ing in the Dragon Open hosted 
by Tif?n University.
On the men’s side, their 
domination in the distance 
runs continued with senior 
Thomas Vandenberg winning 
the 800 meters with a time 
of 1:53.70, 6 seconds faster 
than second place while junior 
Thomas Mayo-Smith ?nished 
third, crossing the line at the 
2:02.99 mark.
In the mile run, the Tar-
tans took 2nd–5th with senior 
George Degen, ?rst-year Ryan 
Auld, senior Eamon Cullinane, 
and master’s student Elliot 
Watson ?nishing with times of 
4:25.38, 4:27.86, 4:30.25, and 
4:32.41 respectively. To ?nish 
of the distance domination, 
Carnegie Mellon swept the top 
three in the 3000 meter run 
with sophomore Ryan Archer, 
senior Joseph Pane and junior 
Brian Bollens crossing the line 
at the 8:50.40, 8:53.80 and 
8:58.04 marks respectively, all 
of which were over 30 seconds 
faster than the next ?nisher. 
In the 4x400 meter relay the 
Tartans A team took 2nd with 
a time of 3:33.44.
On the ?eld side, it was bit 
tougher going for Carnegie 
Mellon with the only top ?n-
ishes coming from a pair of 
?rst-years, Shane Conton and 
Eloy Fernandez, in the Triple 
Jump, ?nishing 3rd and 4th 
with distances of 12.69 meter 
and 12.14 meter respectively.
For the women, the ?rst 
win came in the 400 meter 
with ?rst-year Sarah Cook’s 
time of 1:00.16. Senior Erin 
Kiekhaefer followed up with a 
top place ?nish in the mile run 
with a time of 5:17.61 while 
senior Sara Kelly took 3rd with 
a time of 5:27.35. 
Not to be upstaged by the 
men, the women took the top 
four spots in the 3000 me-
ters, with a trio of juniors, 
Zo?a Tillman, Sophie Lohm-
ann and Kira Ragazzo, along 
with ?rst-year Aparna Ala-
villi ?nishing with times of 
10:47.13, 10:57.04, 11:06.99 
and 11:12.71 respectively.
In the ?eld events, sopho-
more Rebecca Fortner tied for 
third in the high jump, clearing 
the 1.60 meter bar, and senior 
Sasha Spalding set a school re-
cord in the long jump with her 
winning distance of 5.31 m.
Both teams will next com-
pete Friday at Ohio State Uni-
versity.

George Degen continues to shine as student and runner
IAN TANAYA
Junior Staffwriter
“It’s all about ?nding 
something you like and stick-
ing with it,” distance runner 
George Degen said about bal-
ancing the academic rigors of 
Carnegie Mellon and athletic 
demands of his running life-
style as we met in Doherty 
Hall. The senior chemical 
engineering major with a 
computer science minor has 
successfully balanced them so 
?uidly that those around him 
who haven’t quite yet mas-
tered time management can 
only look on enviously.
The Madison, Wis. native 
?rst became interested in 
sports at young age, adopt-
ing soccer as his fall sport 
from kindergarten to ninth 
grade in addition to tennis 
in the spring. After failing to 
make the soccer team for 10th 
grade, he quickly found a new 
home with the cross-country 
team, where the strong team 
atmosphere helped him real-
ize his passion for running. 
“I wasn’t that good in high 
school,” he readily admitted. 
“Out of the seven guys good 
enough to make varsity, I’d 
always be the eighth.” None-
theless, he found great satis-
faction running with the team 
and hoped to continue doing 
so beyond high school.
He considers himself very 
lucky that Carnegie Mellon 
had everything that perfectly 
suited his needs, even if it 
did so in completely unex-
pected ways. His initial con-
siderations revolved around 
a strong engineering pro-
gram outside his hometown 
where he could explore be-
yond the bounds of his prior 
experiences. Although sports 
weren’t a factor for him in 
deciding where to go to col-
lege, he found the school at-
mosphere and athletics pro-
gram at Carnegie Mellon very 
favorable for what he wanted 
to get out of both academics 
and athletics. His relationship 
with his fellow teammates is 
very tight knit. “Living with 
them is great,” Degen said, 
“since we have the same 
schedule.” Obviously, this in-
cludes a lot of running time 
during which they have ample 
time to talk about anything.
Degen considers his role 
in the men’s cross-country 
team’s victory in regionals last 
year his proudest accomplish-
ment in sports. “It felt great 
getting that win for Coach 
Donnatelli,” he said. “Since it 
was his last year, it felt right 
that he could go out on top.” 
Degen credits the coaching 
staff for being an integral part 
of keeping the team together. 
He has praised Gary Aldrich 
for running the team in the 
interim with only two other 
assistant coaches.
Beyond sports, Degen is 
proud to be able to balance 
the academic rigors of Carn-
egie Mellon, including his 
involvement in research, and 
his dedication to athletics 
with the people he consid-
ers to be part of a really fun 
team. “It’s a lot easier to keep 
up with something when you 
actually like and have friends 
that like it too.”
As he looks toward the fu-
ture, he knows that running 
will certainly be a part of ev-
erything he does. With plans 
to go to graduate school, he 
wants to continue running ei-
ther on a club team or through 
using his ?nal season of col-
legiate eligibility. “I’ll keep 
running until I keel over,” he 
summed up.
Seth Cordts captains CMU to success in senior season
ANDY BIRLA
Junior Staffwriter
It is no easy feat to captain a 
team from a slump to back-to-
back home wins. What makes 
this accomplishment even 
more eye-popping is that the 
last back-to-back home wins 
occurred 5 years ago, and this 
time around, both games were 
won by double digits against 
teams that are highly ranked. 
For senior guard Seth Cordts, 
doing all of the above was not 
impressive enough, as he went 
on to be the leading scorer in 
both games. In his time off 
from being a basketball hero, 
Cordts is on the verge of com-
pleting his B.S. in mechanical 
engineering and biomedical 
engineering — a degree that 
in and of itself is a phenom-
enal undertaking.
Cordts’ foray into sports 
began way back in the second 
grade in his elementary school 
league with baseball, soccer, 
and basketball. Soccer piqued 
Cordts’ interest for his ?rst few 
years, but he eventually suc-
cumbed to the in?uence of his 
older sister and her own bas-
ketball exploits. By the sixth 
grade Cordts was reporting to 
a school coach, having been 
coached by his dad up to that 
point. He greatly credits his 
?rst school coach for providing 
him with a strong foundation 
in the sport. This foundation 
is visible in Cordts’ incredible 
fundamental understanding 
of the game and the strength 
of his base skills. Cordts bas-
ketball journey had begun and 
much like his shooting streaks, 
there is no stopping him once 
he starts.
Meanwhile, Cordts’ inter-
est in technical hands-on proj-
ects was pushing him down 
the mechanical engineering 
track. Consequentially, watch-
ing his sisters incur basketball 
injuries (like torn ACLs), he 
began to wonder about the 
ability of technology to help 
people recover from sports in-
juries. As one can see, Cordts 
was not just concerned about 
his impact on the court, and 
always focused on developing 
all aspects of his personality.
Simultaneously, his im-
provement over the years 
was almost magical. He went 
on to play varsity basketball 
at the high school level for 
Souhegan High School in 
New Hampshire. He capped 
his colorful high school career 
by being appointed to captain 
of the varsity team and voted 
to the First Team All-State. 
Cordts turned heads with his 
basketball prowess and one 
of the heads that he turned 
just happened to be Carnegie 
Mellon’s then-assistant bas-
ketball coach Justin Jennings. 
It was during a “Hoop Group” 
showcase that Coach Jennings 
spotted Cordts and recognized 
his immense potential. Jen-
nings approached Cordts and 
they talked about basketball at 
Carnegie Mellon. It was from 
then on that Cordts started 
looking at Carnegie Mellon as 
a strong option to pursue his 
education and basketball.
It is common knowledge 
that college basketball is fast-
er, more physical, and a lot 
more competitive than high 
school basketball. Cordts, 
however, did not shy away 
from the challenge, and exhib-
ited great tenacity in his fresh-
man year by sticking with the 
sport and changing the way he 
played to become a more dom-
inant ?gure on the court. He 
also did not give up on his de-
sire to use technology for the 
betterment of athletes and be-
gan pursuing his dual major in 
mechanical engineering and 
biomedical engineering. As 
usual, Cordts would be active 
in all spheres of his life and 
when asked about his favorite 
memories at Carnegie Mellon 
(barring the dazzling memo-
ries he has on the court) his 
mind jumps to all the times he 
went paint balling and white 
water rafting with his friends.
Although Coach Jennings 
was no longer at Carnegie 
Mellon when Cordts arrived, 
Cordts found a mentor in 
Carnegie Mellon’s then-as-
sistant coach Andrew Garcia. 
Coach Garcia helped Cordts 
understand his role on the 
team and the importance of 
leadership. This was rein-
forced by the example that 
Cordts’ seniors set, and, when 
coupled with his work ethic 
and dedication, his tremen-
dous success as the Tartans’ 
captain comes as no surprise. 
Cordts’ relationship with fel-
low teammate and roommate 
Matthew Loebbaka has been 
a mutually nurturing one and 
is one that Cordts deeply trea-
sures. As teammates, they sup-
port each other on and off the 
court and as roommates they 
share a connection that goes 
beyond basketball well into 
other areas of college life.
When asked about how he 
manages basketball alongside 
his double major Cordts ex-
plained the importance of time 
management and of avoiding 
mixing one with the other. 
According to Cordts, wins 
and losses on the court make 
it hard to focus on the week’s 
homework and vice-versa, so 
he tries to keep a divide be-
tween them mentally. It is no 
secret that at Carnegie Mellon 
the burden of work increases 
exponentially as one climbs 
from freshman year to senior 
year. Therefore it is only natu-
ral to expect basketball to take 
a back seat more often in later 
years. Yet Cordts went from 
scoring 6 points in his fresh-
man year to scoring 363 points 
this year (and the season is 
still not over). While these 
numbers have some great 
stories behind them, the one 
that Cordts holds most dear is 
the story of his away game at 
New York University last year. 
Having shot 100 percent from 
behind the arc, Cordts shot the 
game-tying three points with 
seconds left on the clock, in 
front of a massive audience. 
It’s obvious now why Cordts’ 
favorite drill during practice 
is the shootout between the 
guards and the centers, and 
for the ?rst team to get 10 
baskets from the elbow, wing, 
baseline and behind the arc.
Cordts has had multiple 
pillars of support and motiva-
tion over the years. Having nu-
merous siblings that play bas-
ketball alongside a supportive 
and loving family has kept 
Cordts on track even during 
the toughest of times. Cordts’ 
father ?ies out from New 
Hampshire to watch every 
game, acting as a great source 
of reassurance for Cordts, 
who also spends hours off the 
court talking to his dad about 
basketball and life. Cordts has 
always looked up to his idol 
Kevin Garnett, forward and 
center for the Brooklyn Nets, 
for his passion about the game 
and the reasons that he plays 
it. Cordts’ high school coach 
Sudi Lett was a huge in?uence 
and his words of “Do your best 
and leave the rest” will forever 
instill con?dence in Cordts in 
his personal abilities.
While this season has had 
its ups and downs — the Tar-
tans have gone from winning 
against ranked universities to 
losing to weaker universities 
— Cordts has done his best to 
keep his head down and pull 
his team through, and indeed 
he has done a marvelous job. 
It has been a pleasure to follow 
his basketball journey, and if 
the past is any indication, he 
will keep rising as a person 
and as a player.

Starting Thursday, the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s swimming and div-
ing teams competed in the 
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) Championships 
hosted by Emory University. 
The championships were not 
only about team placement, 
but provided a top opportu-
nity for many of the individu-
als to provisionally qualify for 
NCAA Division III (DIII) na-
tional meet based on the top 
time of the season, which will 
mostly come when pushed by 
some of the top competitors in 
the country.
On Thursday, ?rst-year 
Emma Shi took third place in 
the 200 yard IM with a time of 
2:06.32, which earned her All-
UAA honors and provisional 
quali?cation. Sophomore Ma-
chika Kaku also ?nished third 
in her event, the 3-meter dive, 
with a score of 385.90. Soph-
omore Brian Walsh won the 
B ?nals heat in the 500-yard 
freestyle with a provisionally 
qualifying time of 4:33.89, his 
new career best. Junior Ste-
ven Geier, who ?nished third 
in the same B ?nal, also provi-
sionally quali?ed with a time 
of 4:33.99, a new career best 
for him as well.
In the 400 meter medley 
relay, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s A team of junior 
Kira Singhaus, ?rst-year Kim 
Hochstedler, sophomore Gil-
lian Crews and sophomore 
Allison Kirkby ?nished fourth 
with a time of 3:50.19 which 
provisionally quali?es them 
for nationals. The men’s A 
team ?nished 5th in their 
heat with a time of 3:22.95, 
also provisionally qualifying 
behind ?rst-years Michael Di-
bacco, Matt Chu, and Kevin 
Steinhouse along with Walsh. 
The 200-yard freestyle relay 
team of Shi, Kirkby, Crews 
and ?rst-year Tiana Marrese 
broke the school record set 
last year at UAA champion-
ship with a time of 1:36.91 
but ?nished 6th.
Friday started off strong 
for the Tartans as the 200-
yard medley relay team of 
Singhaus, junior Felicia Wang, 
Crews and Kirkby ?nished 
4th with a time of 1:45.22 
and provisionally quali?ed 
for nationals while setting a 
new school record. The men’s 
200-yard medley relay team 
followed suit with senior Josh 
Lucheon, Chu, sophomore 
Sivan Mehta, and Steinhouse 
placing ?fth with a time of 
1:31.00 and also provisionally 
quali?ed while breaking their 
own school record set earlier 
this year.
In the 400-yard IM ?rst-
year Mary St. John and Shi 
both provisionally quali?ed 
for nationals with times of 
4:32.36 and 4:28.89 respec-
tively, with Shi winning her 
B ?nals heat. Junior Matthew 
Nielson also provisionally 
quali?ed on the men’s side 
in the 400-yard IM with a B 
?nals victory with a time of 
4:02.98.
Crews kept adding to her 
great weekend with a 4th 
place ?nish in the 100-yard 
butter?y with a time of 56.10 
provisionally quali?ed in yet 
another event, along with 
setting a new school record 
while Walsh matched Crews 
in the same event, setting a 
new school record with a time 
of 49.34 for a fourth place ?n-
ish and provisionally qualify-
ing as well.
In the 200-yard freestyle, 
Geier provisionally quali?ed 
for another event with a time 
of 1:40.72 ad a 4th place ?n-
ish, while in the 100-yard 
breaststroke Chu and Hoch-
stedler won their respective 
B ?nal heats and each provi-
sionally quali?ed for nation-
als with times of 56.52 and 
1:05.21 respectively. Walsh, 
Geier, Nielsen and Taekman 
?nished the day strong for the 
Tartans taking 4th in the 800-
yard freestyle relay and provi-
sionally qualifying with a time 
of 6:48.66.
Saturday was the ?nal day 
of the championships and the 
Tartans wanted to go out on a 
high note.
Kaku added a second place 
?nish to her great diving 
weekend as she scored 398.20 
in the 1-meter and earned All-
UAA honors, while DiBacco 
placed third in the 200-yard 
backstroke earning him All-
UAA honors with his time of 
1:50.57, and both he and Gei-
er, who ?nished fourth with a 
time of 1:52.77, provisionally 
quali?ed for nationals in the 
event. For the women, Shi 
won the B ?nal with a time 
of 2:05.12 and provisionally 
quali?ed as well.
In the 200-yard breast-
stroke, Hochstedler pro-
visionally quali?ed for yet 
another event with a school 
record 2:21.65 while winning 
the B ?nal.
Walsh added another pro-
visional quali?cation to his 
meet haul as he placed 2nd in 
the 200-yard butter?y with a 
time of 1:50.66, earning him 
All-UAA honors. 
In the same event, Crews 
provisionally quali?ed for 
one last event with her time 
of 2:06.30. Sophomore Brian 
Jay rounded out the male Tar-
tan quali?ers with a time of 
2:06.16 in the 200-yard but-
ter?y, which placed him 12th 
overall.
For the weekend, both 
squads ?nished 5th overall 
with 1031 points for the wom-
en and 1001 for the men. Em-
ory won both the men’s and 
women’s heats with 1551 and 
2076.5 points respectively. 
Next up for the Tartans 
will be DIII Nationals for 
those provisionally quali?ed 
and make the ?nal cut once 
all Division III conference 
championship are over.

Jesmyn Ward spins stories
Young author discusses race, gender in today’s world
When author Jesmyn Ward finished her speech on 
Mon., Feb. 5, she received a standing ovation that 
seemed to last for hours. Members of the audience 
were clapping, cheering, and some had tears in 
their eyes — a reaction that is rarely, if ever, seen 
at the Literary Evenings lecture series hosted by 
the Carnegie Music Hall.
Ward, a young, powerful writer who has been 
taking the literary world by storm with her intense 
storytelling, spoke primarily about her newest 
book, a memoir titled Men We Reaped, but also 
addressed her other works Where the Line Bleeds 
and Savage the Bones through her speech and 
the audience’s engaging questions. She spun 
a beautiful portrait of her life for the audience, 
beginning on a hot summer day, sitting on a porch 
with her grandmother as she listened to stories 
about how racism and slavery had held their family 
and people back. Ward said that the experiences 
she had in her life were absolutely instrumental in 
her writing, informing nearly every piece she has 
ever written.
With profound diction, Ward painted a powerful 
picture of a life filled with tremendous struggle 
and inspiring optimism. She and her family have 
been consistently plagued by tragedies of all sorts, 
from fighting through Hurricane Katrina only to 
be turned away from shelter by a white family, 
to losing her brother to a drunk driver who was 
acquitted for manslaughter. Ward’s memoir is 
based upon her struggle to understand the deaths 
of three young men who were close to her that she 
lost within a very short time one another.
It was hard not to be moved by Ward’s intensely 
compelling stories and reflections. Though very 
young, she has a disarming manner of speaking 
that conveys a wisdom beyond her years. The 
experiences that she shared, many the same that 
she drew from to write about, were painful and 
incredibly poignant, especially in the current 
political atmosphere. It seemed that her talk would 
have to quietly dance around the controversy 
surrounding Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, and 
Michael Brown, but Ward is not one to quietly 
dance around anything, boldly introducing these 
people by name with many others that she felt still 
deserve justice.
Her talk, poetic and pointed, was one that 
audiences all over the country need to hear. In such 
a polarized political climate regarding race and 
gender issues, Ward and her writings contribute 
interesting and thought-provoking material that is 
worthwhile and timely. Taking the life experiences 
that she has had and turning them into such 
beautiful works of wordsmanship is truly a gift: 
not only for herself, as a therapeutic and cathartic 
experience, but for her readers, so they might be 
taken into a different world. As Ms. Ward pointed 
out, racism and sexism aren’t just problems for 
people of color and women — they’re problems for 
all of us.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I’ve been trying to get a 
girl to notice me for some 
time now. I finally got up 
the courage to ask her 
to switch with me for 
April Fool’s, and she said 
yes, and it was great, but 
she hasn’t spoken to me 
since. I thought it would 
be a first step, something 
to get our future 
relationship going, but I 
haven’t been courageous 
enough to ask her out 
since then...
She’s just so much more 
put together than me. All 
of her things are always 
together; her clothes are 
so colorful while mine 
are just bland. Is there 
anything I can do to put 
myself to her level? I 
suppose I could speak 
up a bit more — girls like 
that, right?
What can I do to get my 
senpai to notice me?
Begging for company this 
Valentine’s,
Derelict Weeaboo Efforts 
at Everlasting Betrothal
Dear DWEEB,
A little-known fact, to my 
readers: Despite leaving my 
email at the bottom of this 
column, no one actually 
writes in — so I make up 
questions, then respond to 
them. This week, however, 
we have a bona fide 
personal question from a real 
student! His name is Howie.
So, from the rather 
unintelligible inquiry you’ve 
sent me, Howie — “switch 
with me for April Fool’s?” 
What does that even mean? 
— I’ve gathered that you get 
most of your dating advice 
from shoujo manga. Heck, 
you even talk like the heroine 
from Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-
kun — which is a fantastic 
show, readers, please take 
note.
I’m going to hazard a guess 
and say that “senpai” 
probably wants to stay away 
from anyone who calls her 
“senpai,” but if you’d rather 
she believe you’re someone 
that you’re not, you could go 
the classic overly-confident-
a**hole route, and when she 
rejects you, show her that 
sensitive side that no one 
else is privileged enough to 
see. She’ll fall for you then 
and there! Or that might 
be another shoujo manga 
stereotype. Who knows?
Even if this does work — 
which it won’t — you still 
won’t have revealed your 
true weeaboo nature. If 
the girl you like is prone 
to wearing colored, cat-
eye contact lenses and 
consistently quotes The 
Irregular at Magic High 
School or Fruits Basket, then 
maybe you have a chance.
Or just write a love 
letter to your favorite 
disproportionately 
breasted anime character,
Evan Kahn

The words “Imma let you ?nish” are four that the 
illustrious Kanye West has yet to live down. At this year’s 
Grammy Awards on Feb. 8, West imitated his famous 
stage-jumping stunt from the Video Music Awards 
(VMAs) ?ve years ago, eliciting a widely varying and 
entertaining response from the celebrity audience. As 
a reminder, the VMA incident in 2009 occurred when 
West hopped up on stage next to Taylor Swift, who 
had won Best Female Video for “You Belong with Me” 
(remember rocking out to that in high school?), grabbed 
her microphone, and proceeded to tell the audience “...
but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of the year — 
one of the best videos of all time!” The video he referred 
to was for the hit “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” (also 
a jam). Instead of a wide-eyed Taylor Swift, this year’s 
Kanye-rant-victim was Beck, seasoned rock musician, 
who won Album of the Year for Morning Phase. Though 
West didn’t attempt to take away the microphone from 
Beck, the impulsive stage leap sent essentially the same 
message, not to mention the backstage comments 
after the awards show. West, along with much of the 
American public, believed that Beyoncé deserved the 
award for Album of the Year for her eponymous album 
that made such a splash after being released with no 
promotion last winter.
Though I stand with the American public insofar as 
I have a very deep and real love for Beyoncé and her 
music, I am frustrated by the response at this year’s 
Grammys. The reactions of young people in particular 
are annoying. Beyoncé brought home awards in multiple 
categories, including Best R&B Song for “Drunk in Love,” 
featuring her husband Jay-Z, honors that many overlook. 
Beck, on the other hand, has been treated by people 
as an undeserving nobody. Not only is this upsetting 
because of my everybody-should-just-love-each-other 
worldview, but it is also wildly untrue. Beck has been 
churning out critically-acclaimed material since the 
early 1990s. Regardless of whether or not a person is 
familiar with Beck’s music, it is disrespectful that so 
many are slamming his artistry. Do I wish Beyoncé had 
won Album of the Year? Yes. I’ve been trying to imitate 
the Queen B’s dance in the “Drunk in Love” music 
video all year and still can’t get it right. But I wish that 
the reactions, by Kanye and fans alike, had been a little 
more controlled. Beyoncé herself, ever-graceful, has not 
spoken out.
In addition to the Beyoncé and Beck issue, the Grammys 
contained many exciting moments. Pharrell Williams’ 
live performance of “Happy” was electrifying. The 
performance also contained a powerful Ferguson tribute, 
with dancers and Williams lifting up their hands in a 
“hands up, don’t shoot” gesture that left chills running 
up and down my spine. For anyone who didn’t catch the 
awards on TV, it is worth checking out that performance 
alone. Williams, replete in a bellhop costume and yellow 
shoes, further proved himself as a man who constantly 
develops his artistry and isn’t afraid to be a little whacky.
Sam Smith impressed at this year’s awards, taking 
home three of the four biggest awards. “Stay with Me,” 
everyone’s favorite crooning hit, garnered Smith the 
award for Best Song and Best Record of the Year. During 
his acceptance speech, Smith thanked the man who 
his Best Pop Album of the Year In the Lonely Hour was 
about “for breaking my heart because it got me four 
Grammys.” His performance of “Stay with Me” with 
Mary J. Blige left no questions regarding his talent.
There were some artists who unexpectedly did not 
win any awards during the show. The a cappella hit 
group Pentatonix won a Grammy for Best Arrangement, 
Instrumental or A Cappella for their song “Daft Punk.” 
However, the ?ve-person group won no awards for their 
Christmas album That’s Christmas to Me, which was the 
best-selling Christmas album this year, as well as being 
certi?ed Platinum and the highest-charting holiday 
album by a group since 1962.
Another artist who left the Grammys undoubtedly 
feeling a little gypped is Sia, who despite an awesome 
Grammy performance did not receive any of the awards. 
Sia performed facing away from the audience, her 
somewhat inexplicable but fascinating habit. In addition 
to her normal dancer Maddie Ziegler (child dancer from 
the celebrated reality show Dance Moms), comedian 
and actress Kristen Wiig also demonstrated her dancing 
chops during “Chandelier.” Though it was enjoyable for 
audiences, most were perplexed by Wiig’s involvement.
Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran also received no awards 
this year, but that didn’t stop Swift in all her glamor 
from dancing her heart out throughout the night. As 
usual, the Grammys provided audiences with drama, 
fashionable stars, and live performances in an evening 
celebrating the most successful and talented musicians 
of today.

Pie that’s almost as cold as your heart
Simple peanut butter pie — an ice pack to soothe the pain of being single. 
Lula Beresford-Banker | Pillbox Editor
This sinful pie is so delicious that it is guaranteed to make you cry a little when you have finished it 
(freshman mechanical engineering major Jade Crocken may have shed a small tear). But that’s okay 
because it only takes about 15 minutes to make yourself another. Go ahead, you deserve it. 
If you’ve been following the progression of the cup-
cakes I’ve written about so far this semester, you’ll 
probably notice that I’ve now done two different reci-
pes that are appropriate for Valentine’s Day romance. 
That’s beautiful and food is romantic, but bottom 
line is I’m single. I’m not going to be sharing yummy 
cupcakes with anyone, and I know there are plenty of 
other singles out there in the same place as me. This 
recipe is for you guys.
The theme of this week’s dessert installment is “eat 
your feelings.” Some haters may try to tell you that this 
method isn’t a healthy coping mechanism (those are 
the same kind of people who tell you not to eat raw 
cookie dough or cake batter. They don’t know what’s 
best for you). But Valentine’s Day is not far gone, and 
I’m here to be an enabler. So my gift to you is a frozen 
chocolate peanut butter pie — sinfully creamy with the 
perfect balance of sweetness and richness. As soon as 
you take a bite, you’ll instantly become so happy that 
you’ll forget how much it sucks to be single, or your 
money back, guaranteed!
This pie is also so easy that it’s actually impossible 
to screw it up. As long as you can stir, you’ll be able 
to pull it all together in ten minutes and it will be 
perfect no matter what. This is the perfect recipe for 
Valentine’s Day. With no possibility of it turning out 
wrong, you won’t need to feel any worse than you 
already do about yourself!
Frozen Peanut Butter Pie
2 9-inch Oreo pie crusts
1 8-ounce package of cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup of powdered sugar
1 16-ounce container of cool whip, thawed
Steps
1) First, mix up the cream cheese, peanut butter and 
powdered sugar until they take on this playdough like 
consistency. I recommend licking the beaters because 
yum. 
2) Before you do this next part, make absolutely sure 
that the cool whip is thawed the whole way through or 
else the texture will be a little lumpy. Now, ideally with 
a wide rubber spatula, start to fold in the cool whip 
a little bit at a time. Be a little extra careful with this 
process. If you rush it then you’ll flop all of the air out 
of the cool whip and it won’t be as dreamy and fluffy, 
which would literally be a tragedy. 
3) When that’s done, divide the peanut butter dream 
cloud straight from heaven between the two pie crusts. 
If you’re feeling especially impatient you can try eating 
it right away, but you owe it to yourself to let it sit in 
the freezer for at least an hour, if not more. 
4) When it’s frozen, cut out a slice, drizzle it with some 
chocolate syrup, and maybe a dollop of whipped cream 
if you’re feeling especially indulgent. 
5) Take a bite, taste how perfect it is, and remember 
that you made that! By the transitive property of des-
sert, you’re perfect too.
Sarah Gutekunst | Operations Manager
Want to eat your feelings, too, 
but you’re not into PB pie?
Try these fun ideas:
1) You know those cute little conversation 
hearts? Chew them up and spit them into 
the toilet to symbolize the nausea that love 
causes you to feel.
2) Sit down with some microwave popcorn 
and a Nicholas Sparks movie. “Treat yo’ self” 
to some target practice with the protagonists!
3) Doritos are always pretty good, too.

The title of the Carnegie Museum of Art’s newest exhibit 
is maybe half accurate. Certainly distant, not very much 
of a feel.
Distant Feel, an exhibit by New York-based French artist 
Antoine Catala, opened in the unexpectedly tight Forum 
Gallery space on Valentine’s Day. Spanning one small 
room, the exhibit featured just three complete pieces, 
offering a limited and strange glimpse into Catala’s 
vision of sentiment in the modern day.
The exhibit’s opening was preceded by the Gulf Tower 
Project, Wednesday through Friday of last week, an 
event which harnessed the emotional content of social 
media to produce ?uctuating visual displays. Using an 
Instagram feed of posts from local users, Catala’s project 
coded each post as emotionally positive or negative 
and generated green or red light atop Pittsburgh’s Gulf 
Tower beacon according to the general mood of the city. 
The artist also gave a lecture at Carnegie Mellon’s Miller 
Gallery on Wednesday to discuss the exhibition.
The dominant series on display features four fabric-
printed photographs — “Feel Images,” as they’re titled. 
The photographs themselves are intentionally bland and 
unremarkable — the kind of sterile, posed, Thinkstock-
imitation images we’re primed to see on billboards and 
in larger-than-life ads in airports: In “Feel Images (Hug),” 
a woman and boy gently embrace; in “Feel Images 
(Feel),” a sad and anxious-looking man gazes straight at 
the camera. In “Feel Images (Distant),” a man checks his 
iPhone, his body slouching away from the camera, the 
cell phone creating a sort of barrier between cameraman 
and subject. And ?nally, most puzzlingly, “Feel Images 
(Forest)” is an Instagram-worthy un?ltered photo of fern-
?lled forest greenery.
But aside from the fact that they’re printed on fabric 
rather than canvas, there’s something unusual that binds 
each of these pieces: Fabric bubble letters protrude from 
each of the images like oddly shaped couch cushions. 
The word “feel” distorts the nameless subject’s chest 
in “Feel.” The word “distant” crowds the image of the 
iPhone-bound man. And most curious of all, a pair of 
uppercase E’s (the second reversed to face the other in 
eerie symmetry), make the image look fake, distorted, 
even comical.
The double E symbol is a recurring image throughout 
the exhibit: At the center of the room stands a lone 
aquarium, the size of a ?sh tank in a dentist’s of?ce. 
The double E, blown up to larger-than-life proportions, 
stands studded with shells and coral in the tank, circled 
by small, bright, tropical-looking ?sh. The setting makes 
the letters look worn and ancient, and it’s strange to 
see such an arti?cial object overgrown with life — 
reminiscent of images of the Titanic’s wreckage.
Aside from the aquarium, the most prominent display is 
a video titled “Empathetic Paul” — in which, according 
to the piece description, “the young alter ego of the artist 
appears in a series of ‘screen tests.’ ” Responding to a 
number of invisible and inaudible cues, an adolescent 
boy imitates a range of emotions: agitation, sadness, 
happiness, fear.
Between these iterations, he collects himself to recite 
emotionally potent lines in a deadpan voice: “I can’t 
wait,” he says dully. “I’m terri?ed.” It seems more a 
commentary on performance — the ability to parrot 
emotion on command rather than seeking it someplace 
heartfelt and genuine — than an account of the current 
state of empathy in our society, but it’s an interesting 
execution nonetheless. As Paul speaks, the familiar 
double E symbol rotates in sharp, 2000s-reminiscent 
transparent block letters, evocative of educational grade-
school math videos in imitation of Bill Nye.
It’s the challenge of an effective art exhibit to reveal the 
right amount of the artist’s intentions behind the work 
— enough to prime viewers but not so much as to rob 
them of their independent thought — and Distant Feel’s 
weakness is in its sparse and cryptic guidance through 
the material, leaving its viewers grasping for a frame of 
reference. 
“Distant Feel is a rebrand of empathy,” the pamphlet 
— a large, folded-up, map-like document — explains. 
“Distant Feel is a cool, detached, focused form of 
empathy. It acknowledges that it’s paradoxically OK to 
be distant and encourages us to express our empathy in 
an effective way.”
Even then, however, the information we get is a 
sketchy and disjointed series of what have become 
modern platitudes about the way we live and feel 
today: “Empathy is fundamental to our shared human 
experiences; core to our biology, our evolution, our 
culture, our society.” Some of these cryptic, context-
devoid sayings seem to contradict each other, leaving 
readers wondering, Is this “distant feel” idea a good 
thing or bad? Is it an observed phenomenon, or a 
concept of the artist’s own creation?
In the literature, we also learn the origin of the 
mysterious double E symbol: Catala contacted ad agency 
Droga5 to help “craft a message to change the world” 
— information that gives the exhibit a new, purposeful 
edge, energized by the quest for progress (although the 
object of that quest is left ambiguous).
Distant Feel, for all its political purpose, keeps viewers at 
an arm’s length, perhaps keeping true to its name. But as 
a sort of hybrid between an art exhibit and an apparent 
ad campaign, it seems to have the best elements of 
neither. While interesting and thought provoking, 
Distant Feel leaves little to resonate with viewers exiting 
the space. For all its conceptual potential, it seems an 
under-realized endeavor, and unfortunately will probably 
be a blip in most Carnegie museum goers’ visits, 
overshadowed by Duane Michals and dinosaurs.

People interested in fashion generally have a couple 
of sources of inspiration that they normally check out 
every now and then, like fashion magazines, blogs, and 
even everyday out?ts worn by others. Now even fashion 
apps are developed for those who really can’t get away 
from fashion. However, a more traditional choice, like 
reading a book about fashion, may also be nice and 
several recommendations below are available for this 
choice.
Some fashion books seem to be written as though 
they are meant for people interested in professions in 
the fashion industry, which is most likely not the case 
for those of you reading this article. Nevertheless, I 
believe that these books can be interesting just for 
the knowledge they provide. For example, one of the 
books mentioned in StyleCaster’s “16 Books to Read 
Immediately” is The Teen Vogue Handbook by Teen 
Vogue. I’m sure most people have heard of Teen Vogue 
before, the magazine that, in my opinion, puts over-the-
top — yet still cool — out?ts together to help people 
?nd new clothing. According to StyleCaster, The Teen 
Vogue Handbook provides information about the roles 
of different members of the fashion industry. This book 
also unfolds “the ultimate behind-the-scenes look” 
of fashion professional, which I think would make an 
interesting reading experience.
Another similar book that caught my eye from StyleCaster 
was the Secrets of Stylists by Sasha Charnin Morrison. As 
its name gives away, the book is about the tips and tricks 
that stylists employ to put together out?ts. I’m always 
wondering how celebrity stylists put out?ts together; then 
I’m aware that this book talks about the ways celebrity 
stylists create out?ts by showing their new, cohesive looks 
designed for their clients.
Some books, on the other hand, offer advice from people 
who are well known in fashion, like Style by Lauren Conrad. 
People can recognize her name from the once-popular 
television show, The Hills. While I’m not too familiar with 
the show, I remember that she had a career in fashion; such 
experiences give her credibility to give fashion advice. 
Even if you don’t feel like you need any advice, I believe 
that this book would be informative as well. After all, you 
never know if you would actually learn something new.
Another similar book is It written by Alexa Chung, who 
is known as a television personality, a model, and a 
fashion icon in a sense. Her book is different from the 
ones mentioned above in the way that it actually ventures 
out of fashion, instead into her musings about music and 
everyday life. While the other books seem to be more 
serious readings, possibly with the exception of Lauren 
Conrad’s, It looks light and easy. People without much 
understanding about fashion could enjoy the book as well.
The last book I want to recommend is called #GirlBoss, by 
Sophia Amoruso, which is more autobiographical in nature. 
#GirlBoss details the author’s rise from a “hitchhiking, 
committing petty theft, and dumpster diving” teenager to 
the founder and CEO of a widely successful online clothing 
store, Nasty Gal. This book is not only about fashion; the 
inspiring personal achievement of Amoruso is also worth 
reading.
There are so many books out there for people interested 
in fashion; the ones above are just a few examples from 
different categories. Try some of these out to see which 
type you prefer and then you can search for more in the 
same category. While our Carnegie Mellon lives keep us all 
busy, there are relatively easy readings for you to check out.

This past week, it was announced that Marvel and 
Sony had finally reached a new deal over the rights 
to Spider-Man. Instead of each approaching this 
deal with the plan of completely buying back the 
franchise, Marvel and Sony agreed to a mutually 
beneficial partnership, which basically gives both 
production studios the ability to use Spider-Man. 
Sony will produce the solo films and receive the 
entire profit from those films, but Marvel will be 
able to include Spider-Man in their Marvel Comic 
Universe (MCU). Although both studios benefit from 
the partnership, Marvel is getting the most benefit 
because it will no longer hold reservations over 
merchandise sales, or the inclusion of the character 
in future comic-book storylines.
Spider-Man is already an important character in 
the Marvel Universe due to his involvement in key 
crossover storylines such as Civil War, Secret Wars, 
Infinity War, Avengers v X-Men, and House of M. 
He has also been a member of most New York based 
superhero teams including The Avengers, the new 
Avengers, Fantastic Four, The Secret Avengers, 
and the Jean Grey School of X-Men. In essence, 
Spider-Man is one of the most versatile characters 
for Marvel right now because he has been able to 
blend in successfully with many different teams. 
Finally, by bringing in Spider-Man, Marvel is also 
able to bring in many characters and elements of 
the franchise that it wouldn’t have been able to: 
primarily Norman Osborne and the Dark Avengers 
storyline, as well as Spider-Woman and her link to 
the Avengers.
The direct implication of the partnership is the 
drastic change of schedule for the next two phases 
in the MCU. Comic book nerds and fans of the 
universe have been clamoring for the inclusion of 
non-male non-white superheroes, Marvel is pushing 
the releases of Black Panther and Captain Marvel to 
2018 in order to make room for a Spider-Man film in 
2017.
That being said, with the addition of Spider-Man 
to the MCU, Marvel is looking at the possibility 
of re-casting the role and using one of the later 
iterations of the superhero. In other words, Marvel 
is definitely making a Spider-Man movie, but Peter 
Parker might not be involved at all, instead they 
might opt for a young Spider-Man that debuted in 
2011, Miles Morales. Marvel could still potentially 
cast whomever they want as their new Spider-Man, 
but a lot of media attention has been given to the 
possibility of Donald Glover taking the role of Your 
Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
Another interesting implication of this partnership is 
that Sony has inadvertently given Marvel the power 
it needs to finally re-acquire all of its characters. 
Marvel will now be adamant about ensuring that the 
X-Men and the Fantastic Four return home. Marvel 
stopped selling merchandise for both in order to hurt 
promotion of the movies coming from 20th Century 
Fox. Marvel has not been afraid to diminish certain 
characters’ roles in the crossovers, and it recently 
announced that it would cancel the Fantastic Four 
comic book series in order to place an even larger 
burden on Fox. 20th Century Fox has lost a few 
recent battles in the war over rights, namely the 
loss of Fantastic Four solo storylines, and the loss of 
exclusivity over certain characters from the X-Men 
franchise (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver).
Marvel played its cards extremely well in both of 
these instances. The Fantastic Four comic book 
franchise was not profitable, so they do not see 
any real loss from eliminating that series from their 
shelves since the characters can still interact in 
the overall Marvel Universe without having their 
solo series. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver 
exceptions to the agreement that Fox and Marvel 
made are key to Marvel, since they found a loophole 
to the agreement that allows them to have mutant 
members of the Avengers as long as they never 
mention the fact that they are mutants.
Theoretically, this could allow them to use many of 
the X-Men characters that have done double-duty 
as members of the Avengers, including Rogue, 
Wolverine, and Havok. More likely, however, is that 
Marvel continues to exploit new X-Men storylines 
that depend on other characters Fox doesn’t 
own in order to stop them from using them as 
potential movies. This could drive Fox to re-visit 
the agreement with Marvel and establish another 
partnership. Of course, this would occur only after 
the X-Men movie franchise dips back to the quality 
of X-Men: The Last Stand. Until then, Storm and the 
Black Panther won’t ever find love.

Interstellar is an epically beautiful ?lm that stretches the imagination and the mind to 
its fullest. But… who would name their child after Murphy’s Law? What can go wrong 
will go wrong. Was that their sly way of saying she was a mistake? Do they know the 
price of therapy in a post-apocalyptic America? Me neither, but it sounds expensive. 
That aside, Interstellar revolves around the relationship between Murphy (Mackenzie 
Foy/Jessica Chastain) and her father (Matthew McConaughey) when he is sent to ?nd 
an alternate living solution on another planet. And if you are familiar with Christopher 
Nolan, known for the Dark Knight series and Inception, you will already know how 
intricate and involved his plot lines get. The starting point and the ending point are so 
different that the already two hour and 50 minute epic can feel like eight hours and two 
lifetimes. And with the music rendering some of the dialogue completely inaudible, it 
feels as if you are chained to a New York City nightclub speaker with the bass turned 
up all the way up. So bring earplugs and your cushiest neck pillow because you will be 
in for one long and loud ride, folks.

Fifty Shades of Grey was exactly what you’d expect. I’ll 
admit before I get into the nitty-gritty of the movie that 
I didn’t read the book, but I think in this case that may 
have been to my advantage.
Fifty Shades of Grey has been raising controversy for 
weeks: The movie and the book glamorize an abusive 
relationship and misrepresent the bondage, dominance, 
sadism, and masochism (BDSM) community. The books 
— Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty 
Shades Freed — are notorious not only for scandalizing 
the general public with smutty, fetishized sex, but also 
for some of the most poorly written prose to ever hit the 
New York Times Best Sellers list.
Erika Mitchell ?rst published the books under the pen 
name E.L. James; the novels were born of an overgrown 
Twilight fan ?ction. Fifty Shades of Grey is a lot like 
Twilight in more ways than one. Both are made up 
of a string of painful romance novel clichés: both are 
set in the rainy-but-beautiful Paci?c Northwest; and 
both feature a shy girl who falls in love with a powerful 
man. Both have also sold more than 100 million copies 
worldwide.
Just the names of the movie’s protagonists — Anastasia 
Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie 
Dornan) — tell that you this is going to be at least as 
painful to watch as anything based on a Nicholas Sparks 
novel. Anastasia, or Ana, has everything the perfect 
ingénue needs: She’s bookish, shy, virginal, and drinks 
tea. Christian Grey, on the other hand, is a powerful 
27-year-old billionaire with a mysterious and dark past 
that left him only able to ?nd pleasure as a “Dominant” 
(the Dominant, as it sounds, is the dominant partner 
in a BDSM relationship, which leaves Ana as the 
“Submissive”).
The central con?ict of the movie comes from a contract 
that Christian wants Ana to sign, a contract that outlines 
everything from what he can do to her sexually in his 
“playroom” (which Ana refers to as the “red room of 
pain”) to how many times a week she has to go to the 
gym and what she can eat. Ana is, understandably, a 
little reluctant. Christian pushes her to the limits of her 
tolerance, admitting near the end of the movie that he’s 
“?fty shades of f***ed up.”
If you’re seeing Fifty Shades of Grey for the sex, you 
probably won’t be disappointed — the movie features 
over 20 minutes of R-rated sex, and both lead actors 
are beautiful by almost anyone’s standards. The plot, 
however, is lacking, mostly because it is essentially 
nonexistent. The movie limps along as sex scenes 
are linked together with droll dialogue and some 
admittedly nice, if boring, aerial panoramas of Seattle 
and Vancouver. Christian’s character is often laughable; 
it is hard not to giggle when he leans over Ana’s bed, 
shirtless and sweaty from a workout, and powerfully yet 
“erotically” takes a bite of her buttered toast.
Ana, too, is a painful caricature of an innocent English 
literature major. Ana’s roommate remarks that Ana seems 
different after she loses her virginity to Grey, because 
E.L. James apparently thinks that losing your virginity 
changes you fundamentally as a person, a myth that 
feminists have been ?ghting for decades.
If you’ve seen the trailer of Fifty Shades of Grey, 
you’ve already seen all the one-liners that make the 
movie entertaining at times. (“I don’t do romance. My 
tastes are very singular.”) On some levels, this movie 
wasn’t any better or worse than your run-of-the-mill 
bad romance movie, à la The Vow or Twilight. That 
doesn’t mean it was good, by any means, but it appeals 
to a certain demographic and has its place on a rainy 
Sunday afternoon. However it’s hard to ignore all the 
more deeply rooted ideological problems of the ?lm, the 
ones that delegitimize the BDSM community and make 
Christian Grey’s abuse seem like romance. These facets 
of Fifty Shades of Grey take it from laughable to almost 
intolerable.

Carnegie Mellon’s Scotch’n’Soda recently put up 
their take on Stephen Adly Guirgis’s production The 
Motherfucker With The Hat. Loud and brash in parts, 
extraordinarily subtle in others, and chock full of 
gratuitous swearing throughout, the play works as a 
heady cocktail of guffaw-inducing one liners on one 
side and gut-wrenchingly painful moments on the 
other. As such, Motherfucker’s greatest strength lay 
in its ability to walk the ?ne line between hysterical 
humor and soul-scorching re?ection.
Jackie, played by senior communication design major 
Sam Ahmed, is fresh out of jail and trying to stay clean. 
Having ?nally gotten a job, he wants to stay away from 
drugs and booze and do his part as a well-adjusted 
member of society. His girlfriend Veronica, on the 
other hand, played by junior civil and environmental 
engineering and engineering and public policy double 
major Erin Persson, loves her booze, cigarettes, and 
cocaine. In the hilarious opening scene, Veronica 
smokes a cigarette and snorts a line while telling her 
mother to look after herself and dump her current 
boyfriend. Jackie, ever the doting boyfriend, walks in, 
full of excitement because he found a job. The premise 
of the play is set when Jackie discovers a man’s hat in 
the living room that doesn’t belong to him. From that 
point on, everything goes south for him and Veronica.
Looking for advice, Jackie turns to his Alcoholics 
Anonymous sponsor Ralph, played by senior 
professional writing and global studies double major 
Razghiem Golden. Ralph, himself an ex-addict, now 
a health beverage obsessive, tells Jackie to dump 
Veronica because of her philandering and constant 
drug habits. In the meantime, Ralph isn’t doing too 
well with his own wife Victoria either, played by 
senior psychology major Nkem Chikwendu. From this 
point on, Motherfucker follows the explosions and 
repercussions that spill over from this simmering brew 
of raging emotions.
The casting is spot on. Sam Ahmed, as Jackie, is 
innocently oblivious to the machinations of those 
around him. He wears Jackie’s struggles on his sleeve, 
from his problems with Veronica to his problems with 
substances. Easy to manipulate and constantly at war 
with himself, he elicits sympathy from the audience in 
spite of his questionable judgement.
Erin Persson as Veronica is equally likable. Effectively 
playing the part of a woman dealing with the 
consequences of mistakes she made when her 
boyfriend was away in prison for two years, she lurches 
from crisis to crisis. Constantly tortured, she lashes out 
at everyone who stands in her way. At the end of the 
day, one feels bad for her being trapped in a horrible 
situation she clearly can’t escape.
Razghiem Golden as Ralph is a smooth talker that 
seems to be a model of comically good behavior. It 
takes a while for one to realize that there is more to him 
than meets the eye. In a hilariously horrifying scene, 
Jackie confronts Ralph after a betrayal, only to have 
Ralph turn the tables on him for not having gotten his 
life together.
We also have Jackie’s cousin Julio, played by senior 
vocal performance major Taylor Rawley. Julio is played 
as a sensitive, effeminate individual who repeatedly 
helps Jackie even though he overtly despises him. 
Whether he is discussing hair care and waxing or 
emulating Jean Claude Van Damme, Julio makes for a 
good comic foil to the comparatively somber Ralph.
 
The standout character, however, is Chikwendu as 
Ralph’s wife Victoria. Subtle and understated, she 
slowly evolves from the stereotypical disgruntled wife 
into the most layered character of the lot. In what is 
arguably the best scene in Motherfucker, after smoking 
some weed with Jackie, Victoria tries to convince 
him to sleep with her out of pity. When he refuses, 
she tells him information that goes on to dominate the 
proceedings from that point onwards.
In spite of the depressing subject matter, watching 
Motherfucker was a riot. The actors all have impeccable 
comic timing. Brutal scenes are made all the more 
horrifying by how funny they are. The play deals with 
several themes, including unrequited lust and its 
consequences. Several characters have very different 
motivations for coupling with several others; this 
sets an interesting canvas for the confrontations that 
inevitably occur.
More than anything else though, Motherfucker shines 
for being stuffed with irrational, overwrought and pulpy 
emotion. Characters act on impulse. They rarely, if ever, 
make rationally sound decisions. But whether lust or 
love or addiction or pain or betrayal, the characters 
feel so strongly as to captivate the audience into 
empathetic submission.
