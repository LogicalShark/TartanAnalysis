Vol. 69, No. 48C-MUFRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1970
Trustees Admit Students Duquesne Broke National A.CtlOn
In their meeting this week, the 
Board of Trustees approved the 
following recommendations of the 
Study Committee on Student-Trus­
tee Relationships:
111 That the student member­
ship on Trustee Committees 
should be formalized with a clear 
process for the appointment of 
students to meet with those com­
mittees and a regularly published 
schedule of the agenda of those 
committees;
<21 That notice and proceedings 
of the meetings of the Board of 
Trustees be published so that 
members of the student body and 
faculty can be better informed of 
the processes performed by the 
Board.
InI That the president of the 
student body should be invited to 
attend meetings of the Trustees 
on the same basis that the chair­
man of the Faculty Senate is in­
vited to attend them.
In connection with Item No. I. 
the Study Committee thought that 
students should be invited, through 
the president, to meet regularly 
with the Trustee Committees on 
Educational Affairs. Student Af­
fairs. Buildings and Grounds, and 
Development and Planning. The 
Study Committee also felt that a 
means for faculty involvement 
with these committees should also 
be formalized. Invitations to fac­
ulty and students to meet with 
other Trustee Committees would 
be made through the president as 
the needs arise. And. finally, it 
urged that the chairman of the 
Trustees’ Committees make sure 
that the students invited to sit with 
them have the opportunity to pre­
sent matters for consideration in 
the committees as appropriate to 
their agendas.
The Study Committee also con­
sidered the appropriateness ot re­
questing a regular report from the 
president of Student Government 
at each Board meeting parallel to 
the report now presented by the 
chairman of the faculty and rec­
ommend that this be done. The 
Study Committee consisted ot the 
following:
E. H. Schatz. chairman. Carter 
Allen. Harold J. Day. Joe Duck­
worth. J. Tomlinson Fort. Daniel 
F. Resnick. Earle R. Swank, and 
James M. Walton.
In the Study Committee, discus­
sion indicated that the original 
Student Senate motion wa> intend­
ed to build on the student-faculty- 
admimstrative relationship begun 
.it the level of Student Affairs 
Committee of the Trustees and. 
thereby, increase communication. 
Student and faculty alike report­
ed the success of student partici­
pation on other University com­
mittees and the feeling that con­
tact at some level with the Trus­
tees would enhance reverse com­
munication. that is. a better un­
derstanding of the functions and 
actions of the Trustees.
Discussion made clear that stu­
dents have little knowledge ot the 
kinds of business transacted by 
Trustees but assume that some 
matters concerning them deeply 
may be discussed in what seems 
a secret process. It was also point­
ed out that the chairman of the 
Facult> Senate i^ involved to at­
tend meetings of the Tustees but 
¡hat no student i' normally invit­
ed to attend. Tr the dis-cussion 
there ws evidence that 
part of the desire was for an at­
mosphere of mutual trust and 
openness.
Penn State Erupts
by Chuck Daly
What began last Wednesday as 
a peaceful Moratorim Demon­
stration at Pennsylvania State 
University has led to the arrest of 
36 students and injury to 18 Penn­
sylvania State Troopers.
As part of the nationwide April 
Moratorum action. Penn State 
students visited the University Ad­
ministration offices in an attempt 
to gain recognition of various stu­
dent grievances.
When the students failed to re­
ceive an answer from the admin­
istration. they decided to remain 
in the building until recognition 
was granted.
Early in the evening a court in­
junction was ordered and shortly 
thereafter State Police began ar­
rests.
The presence of the police on 
campus led to large scale violence 
during the ensuing week. Fires
were set in several buildings and 
University President Eric Walk­
er was forced to flee his campus 
home Monday night as it was bom­
barded by bricks. State Police 
were also victims of this brick 
barrage as 18 were injured.
As of Wednesday evening the 
police were ordered oft the cam­
pus as various groups considered 
further action. A student initiated 
boycott of classes appeared to be 
gaining support.
The initial demands of the stu­
dents included the end of military 
research on campus, termination 
of the University’s ROTC con­
tract and an open admission poli­
cy. The chief demand at present 
appears to be for amnesty for the 
36 arrested students.
The PSU Board of Trustees vot­
ed overwhelmingly against grant­
ing amnesty while many called 
for the explusion of the involved 
students.
Duquesne University has found 
itself in a financial crisis so grave 
that the school may be forced to 
close down after the first of July, 
when it will run out of money.
The University president. Fa­
ther Henry J. McAnulty. feels that 
the only hope for a long-term solu­
tion to the financial problem will 
be an increase in state and federal 
tunds directed towards the school.
Planned For Gulf 
Stockholders Here
To help meet the immediate 
crisis, however. Duquesne is tak­
ing some urgent steps. Not only 
have they asked the school's 22.-
000 alumni for immediate contri­
butions of no less than $100. but 
they have also organized a group 
of 500 student volunteers who will 
personally contact the local com­
munity. local businesses and the 
alumni to gain the necessary tem­
porary financial support.
In addressing the students. Fa­
ther McAnulty cited recent capi­
tal tund-raising tailures as one 
cause of the sudden crisis.
Although a $400 tuition increase 
would enable Duquesne to meet 
expenses. Father McAnulty pre- 
ters not to approve such a move. 
A tuition increase of $200 itotal­
ing now $1.8001 as well as high 
dormitory rooming rates had al­
ready been approved for next year.
The president of „the Duquesne 
Student Congress pointed out that 
only a select few could afford a 
$400 tuition increase. Father 
McAnulty advocates direct tuition 
grants to the students from the 
federal and state government, 
equalizing private and state school 
costs, and putting private schools 
on an even tooting with state in­
stitutions in competing for stu­
dents.
A militant but non-violent dem­
onstration called by the Gulf Ac­
tion Project and the Committee 
of Returned Volunteers < ex-Peace 
Corps volunteers who now op­
pose U.S. imperialismi will be 
staged on the Pitt lawn Tuesday. 
April 28. beginning at 10 a.m.
The speakers featured at the 
rally will include a representa­
tive ol the Mozambique Liberation 
Movement. John Froines of the 
Chicago Conspiracy, a member of 
the Welfare Rights Organization, 
and Dr. Buff, who has been active 
in the struggle against unhealthy 
working conditions in the coal 
mines, including Mellon-owned 
Consolidation Coal and Gulf sub­
sidiary Pittsburgh & Midway Coal 
Mining Co. A rock band will bring 
an air of festivity to the demon­
stration.
Decentralized actions scatter­
ed throughout the city and focus­
ing on Mellon-eontrolled institu­
tions will follow the rally. These 
will include urban renewal sites, 
banks and downtown headquar­
ters ol the Mellon empire Hiulf. 
koppers. Alcoa. Porter •.
Inside the stockholders meet­
ing. church groups and members 
of the (iull Action Project will 
attempt to raise issues involving 
different aspects of Gulf's opera­
tions. The demands to be raised 
inside the meeting include an 
end to war production ijulf 
supplies the Pentagon with $85
million annually in aviation fuel 
and its subsidiary Gulf General 
Atomic is testing the ABM sys­
tem»; »2» an end to Third World 
exploitation» such as its opera­
tions in the Portuguese colony of 
Angola, supplying Portugal with 
$20 million in oil royalties annual­
ly. and assuring not only Portugal, 
but also assuring the white supre­
macist governments of Rhodesia. 
South Africa, with a secure sup­
ply of oil against any possible em­
bargo All these governments are 
faced with national liberation 
movements seeking to regain con­
trol of their governments and eco­
nomic systems», and »3» com- 
munitv and workej control of Gulf.
This demand would mean an 
end to pollution < Gulf is one of the 
tour oil companies being sued for 
polluting the Santa Barbara chan­
nel». a reduction in consumer 
prices, and control of decision­
making by those most directly af­
fected by Gulf's operations. Gulf 
workers, the people who live in 
the countries from which oil is 
extracted, and domestic oil con­
sumers.
The tjulf action is one of a num­
ber of anti-corporate demonstra­
tions this spring across the nation 
and represents an attempt by the 
New Mobilization Committee and 
other groups to focus anti-war 
sentiment on the institutions that 
profit from the war in Southeast 
Asia and perpetuate American 
imperialism.
New Pre-Registration Policy
To All Day Freshman. Sopho­
more. Junior and Graduate Stu­
dents except those in Architec­
ture. Drama. Industrial Adminis­
tration and Social Relations:
In an attempt to help stu­
dents make firm commitments 
regarding course selections for 
the Fall Semester 1970. and also 
to give academic departments 
information regarding course 
demands, the Educational Pol­
icy Council, on March 9th. 
voted the following:
All presently enrolled day 
undergraduate and day graduate 
students who pUn to return for 
the fall semester must complete 
the academic portion of regis­
tration during a day this spring.
The implementation of the above 
procedures is as follows:
1. Schedules of classes will be 
available in academic depart­
ments during the week of Ap­
ril 20 - 24.
2 Academic departments will
be set up in the gymnasium 
to handle course section en­
rollment on Wednesday. April 
29. between the hours of 1 and 
5 pm and 6:15 p.m. to 
9 p.m.
3. Since no provision has been 
made for cancelling classes 
on this day. students will ne­
cessarily have to individually 
arrange:
a) securing of four approved 
schedule cards from depart­
ment advisor who will re­
tain one schedule card.
b) appearance into the gym­
nasium where section enroll­
ment will be completed.
4. In addition to the approved 
schedules, it will be necessary 
that students bring to the gym­
nasium the student master 
card that must be picked up 
on Thurs.. Apr. 23 or Fri., 
Apr 24, in the Multi-Pur­
pose Room in the Basement of 
Hunt Library from 8:30 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. For students who
may be contemplating or are 
in the process of making de­
partmental changes, it will 
not be necessary to have these 
master cards changed for this 
process.
5. At the end of the pre-regis­
tration line, photographs will 
be taken and signatures ob­
tained to permit advance pro­
cessing for new permanent ID 
cards to be issued beginning 
in the fall of 1970.
6. During the summer, instruc* 
tions will be sent to outline 
the procedures necessary to 
complete registration and fee 
settlement, and for making 
any needed schedule changes. 
Students who have completed 
the ID card processing on 
April 29 will be issued their 
cards at completion of fee 
settlement in September.

Editorial
I
It is faily easy to view the Gulf Action Project as a futile, 
Quixotic gesture. After all, the Mellons reputedly own 80 per 
cent of the stock. Obviously, the peace people can’t possibly ac­
complish anything in terms of actual changes in corporate poli­
cy. They probably won’t even be allowed inside the stockhold­
er’s meeting. So what’s all the fuss about.
The big fuss is, that by attacking the very heart of this 
enormous agregate of power, the left has, and will to a greater 
degree, stimulate this agregate into exercising its power can 
be considered legitimate or illicit. Many people will judge the 
success or failure of thktion on whether or not it can produce 
a reaction excessive enough to be judged as illicit by those not 
yet convinced that a missuse of power is occuring.
But the left is essentially calling into question the right of 
any individual or small group of individuals to control so much 
power and not be answerable or accountable for its use. This 
isn’t a new question. Throughout history people have asked the 
same question with regard to monarchies, frequently over­
throwing those they judged to have cruelly or foolishly abused 
their power. Our present form of government was devised as an 
answer to the problem of distributing power and making it ac­
countable.
What the left is trying to get across is that now. in our post 
industrial society, a new form of concentrated power has emerg­
ed, which our form of government does not, or cannot, make 
answerable or accountable; that this concentration of economic 
and technological control is not subject to the restraints of a 
system set up to limit power to concentrations based on man­
power. That is why the left points to this new alignment of so­
cial forces as a prime cause of our moral dilemma in Indo- 
China.
By challenging Gulf Oil on its own ground, by putting it in 
the position of physically silencing its own stockholders, the 
Gulf Ation people hope to more clearly delineate this non­
accountability. You owe it to yourself, in order to see tor your­
self (don’t trust the media) how closely these concepts resemble 
the truth, to be present at the action on the 28th..

I would like to announce that The Relative Truth will be 
handed over to Jennifer Digby and Wayne Barron next year. No 
dumb cracks about musical papers, please.
III
Nixon has announced his plans to abolish most job defer­
ments. That means no more cushy teaching or defense job hid­
ing places. All those people who thought they could ignore the 
war by hiding from it better start thinking again. Along with 
this, Nixon has failed to come up with a meaningful program 
for getting us out of Vietnam. Vague commitments to future pull 
outs just won't do. Have you noticed that even though we are 
supposed to have pulled out all those troops already, the casual­
ty figures are at a seven month high? One begins to wonder who 
really runs this country when one reads that the Pentagon went 
ahead and shipped $20 million worth of arms to the fascist mili­
tary regime in Greece in direct defiance of a congressional or­
der. Nice way to keep the world safe for democracy.

I must apologize for the scarcity of copy in this issue. We 
are working on a better way to handle such overloads of adver­
tising.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Gulf Con
To the Editor:
It is necessary to take an intelligent stand on the 
Gulf Action Project's planned picketing of the stock­
holder's meeting on April 28. I would especially like 
to argue with the flyer they littered the cafeteria 
with, which consisted of numerous unprovable (and 
untrue i assertions. A careful look at the issues in­
volved would help clear up this matter enormously.
Four of the most important land most ludicrous) 
of the assertions claimed that Gulf and the Mellons 
controlled us by il giving away $13,710,000 in stock 
to key men" and none to the rank and file: <2i 
Our boys are fighting in Vietnam to protect Gulf's 
interests there"; (3> No "third world” nation prof­
it's from it's own oil: <4> Mellon Bank makes mon­
ey foreclosing mortgages.
Point (1 1 would like lo know what i> meant
by giving away. Don't vou mean that Gull s ' key 
men" get stock options as a part of their salary, or 
as a fringe benefit? This stock isn't given away, it 
is earned by the executives and scientists who 
work for Gulf.
Gull Oil isn t run bv -dave labor. They don't dis­
cover oil. drill for it. refine it. transport it and 
market it by brute strength. It can s be done by 
wanting to do it. or feeling that it can be done. The 
only way that oil can be processed is by applied 
technology, intelligence, and good business techni­
ques (including profit making). What's important 
to Gulf is your brain, not your back. The key men 
are those who use their minds. The mind is the 
driving force behind all corporations, the motor 
that runs the world.
The importance of the mind can be seen by look­
ing at Bolivia (Pittsburgh Press, Sunday. April 5. 
page 1. section 2>. Last year Bolivia decided to stop 
letting Gulf exploit" them, and nationalized Gulf's 
holdings. Result: Bolivia hasn't sold a drop of oil 
since. Nobody trusts them enough to deal with them. 
After the way they treated Gulf, the Bolivians can't 
find anybody to look for more oil. They don't have 
the brains to do it themselves. But now their money 
can't buy brains, and their brute strength can't na­
tionalize the mind. It is the rational mind which is 
the source of all wealth.
Incidentally. Gulf was asked into Bolivia by the 
Bolivians themselves in 1956. Besides paying for 
the "right" to process that oil. Gulf paid Bolivia 
royalties, or a rakeoff. that went up every year. The 
royalties from oil in Kuwait give it the highest per
capita income in the world. So much for point i3>. 
Every third world country which let American cor­
porations "exploit" its oil gets royalties of some 
kind. For which they sit back and do nothing. Thou­
sands get job s they otherwide wouldn't have.
Does Gulf profit? You're damn straight they do. 
It's their investment and exploration and know­
how which bring those oil wells into existence. Who 
gets the profits? The people who created them. Gulf u 
Oil.
Point (2 i is really far off base. If you really be­
lieve that, you silly shits, then—prove it.
Point (4 i becomes an accusation only if we ac­
cept the idea that foreclosing a mortgage is evil 
and odious. If that is assumed, then this is the prin­
cipal involved. After Mellon Bank buys a home for 
you. if you don't want to. or can t pay them for their 
house, why then, to hell with the Mellons. In other 
words, you have a right to force the Mellon s to give 
their home to you! A right" to steal?
Observe that in all the points discussed, the is­
sue is not poor vs. rich, but UNEARNED VS. 
EARNED. It's your "right" to my property against 
my right to my own property. It is the ignorant and 
non-producers against the men of the mind and the 
producers (capitalists). This is the revolt of the 
gun (government's which nationalize industry, and 
students who try to do the same i against the mind 
and its free market result, the corporation. While 
claiming they have a "right" to the unearned, these 1 
thugs neglect to point out that by negating proper­
ty rights, they have also negated the right to live. If
I produce only for others, by what means am I to 
keep myself alive? Do I have a right to eat my own 
food while someone else starves? GAP would ap­
parently have us believe no. The answer is an un­
qualified YES! '
The issues are quite clear. On April 28. these 
demands, turning over protits to the poor and 
voluntary' nationalization of all Gulf's proper­
ties. will be presented to stockholders meeting. An 
ultimation imple an "or else" clause. Ask your­
self what GAP's or else" clause is. A gun'’ Nation­
alization'7 Brute force cannot supercede reason. 
You cannot reverse the law of cause and affect. 
You cannot replace man's mind by seizing the pro­
ducts of his mind. Ask Bolivia. When you make a 
decision to support either Gulf Oil or GAP. remem­
ber what the issues are. and remember which side 
gains by presenting them and which side gains by 
avoiding them. Don't feel—THINK! It's your mind— 
and their gun.

To the Editors:
I am writing in reply to the 
above letter by Greg O'Neill. 
O'Neill obviously has a very su­
perficial naive analysis of the 
Gulf Action Project, the Bolivian 
expropriation, and the interna­
tional oil cartel. His letter is full 
of uninformed elitist rhetoric, and 
racist slurs on the Bolivian peo­
ple. In this short space I will only 
try to present some of the high­
lights of the Bolivian situation.
Before nationalization. Gulf 
had a virtual monopoly on the Bo­
livian petroleum industry, pro­
ducing 80 per cent of the total out­
put. Despite that Mr. ONeill 
might think, the oil industry in

Unfair Firing
Editor. The Tartan:
Recent events in the English 
Department have called into ques­
tion the policies of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
not to rehire non-Ph Ds and not to 
rehire instructors after their 
three year tenure here. Because 
of these policies, the English De­
partment is losing two of its finest 
teachers. James K. Hastie and 
James R. Myers. It is disturbing 
that the dean of H&SS. Erwin R. 
Steinberg, appears to be an ex-, 
ception to the rules he now en­
forces. Dean Steinberg received 
his doctorate 14 years after re­
ceiving his masters. In his first

of their precious natural re­

letter: ' Does Gulf profit0 You're 
damn straight they do."
It is quite apparent that Gulf 
is not going to allow their profits 
to go to the Bolivians. After na­
tionalization. the chairman of 
Gulf. E. D. Brockett. demanded 
that the United Sates cease all 
foreign aid to Blivia. Mr. O'Neill 
seems to think that Blivia cannot 
sell its oil because nobody "trusts " 
them. This statement, in light of 
the stranglehold of the interna­

top of all of this, the U.S. has 
threatened to dump its tin re­

down the price of Bolivian tin.

Our first indication of the rasie 
was a leaflet shoved under our 
doors. We were told that relevant

Next I must protest this lunacy 
that is being forced upon us under 
the name of registration. We are 
given less than a week's notice of 
this sequence of events; the fall 
classes have not all been sched­
uled yet and no catalog has yet 
been prepared (nor will it be until 
half way through next semester,

Media Creates Myths 
About Women’s Liberation
by Janice Richman
Thanks to the sensational cov­
erage by the media of the Wom­
en's Liberation Movement, many 
of our potential sisters are being 
turned off by the subtle distor­
tion and ridicule of the press. We 
do want to liberate both women 
and men from the present-day ar­
chaic role stereotypes, but we do 
not:
Want to kill men: Most of the 
women in our C-MU Women's Lib 
Group are trying to better their 
relationships and friendships with 
men. We attempt to be as honest 
to ourselves as we can. although 
this often means piercing through 
some of the actions we have al­
ways taken for granted (doing 
dishes, bolstering the male ego. 
raising prospective children i in 
order to choose fairly what we 
really want to do. Those of us who 
are not involved in relationships 
with men are finding it much 
harder to enjoy a passive role, 
and are choosing our men friends 
much more carefully.
Want to be Lesbians: We re still 
much too optimistic about our 
ability to stand up to men and 
work out the hassles in a relation­
ship to have gotten into that.
Conduct group therapy: Al­
though we do spend a lot of time 
analyzing our personal behavior

to believe, but rather societal 
problems. The fact that so many 
hang-ups are shared by our sis­
ters demonstrates this to us again 
and again.
Want to be men: Just because 
we resent the power and control 
men have over our lives, our time, 
and our emotions does not mean 
that we want to have the same 
power over them. We don't have a 
chairman or a president because 
we're trying to get away from 
that kind of power structure. We 
are learning to be more assertive 
and to take ourselves more seri­
ously. but we are not trying to 
become aggressive.
Consider ourselves liberated:
As long as this society dictates 
how we are supposed to behave 
and how our children will be train­
ed. we are not liberated, even 
though we are coming to terms 
with ourselves and the men in our 
lives.
Consider ourselves unliber­
ated: We have gottoR up the cour­
age to try and change the world 
for ourselves and our sisters and 
eventually for men and that is 
something.
However, if any of you women 
do want to kill men. be lesbians, 
conduct group therapy or if you 
consider yourselves liberated or 
the opposite, come to talk to us at 
our meetings or at the Women's 
Liberation Conference on April
25. because it’s obvious that 
you've noticed something wrong 
with the way things are.

often I reluctantly put together 
some standard phrases and hope 
the questioner understands. With 
such a complex issue, what can I 
say in two or three casual sen­
tences that will be honest to either 
of us'.' And so. with much anxiety, 
here is another brief explana­
tion."
Women's liberation is an ex­
amination of the whole socializa­
tion process which continues to 
shape all of us. The movement 
prods us into asking why we. as 
college women, keep choosing" 
to become teachers or nurses or 
child development specialists or 
social workers and not adminis­
trators or doctors or economists 
or politicians. Is it really women's
nature" which makes us so often 
pick service occupations, or is it 
a whole socialization process 
which teaches us to be supportive 
rather than assertive?

In our personal relations with 
men and on a societal level wom­
en complement men s lives. How 
many times have you seen a male 
secretary to a women executive?
1 am not saying that there is any­
thing wrong with the occupations 
that women traditionallt 
"choose." or for that matter any­
thing particularly desirable about 
the ones men occupy. I am say­
ing that we women are taught to 
not take ourselves seriously and 
this gets expressed in the profes­
sions we as a group, choose. They 
are mainly professions which em­
phasize the qualities of sacrifice, 
of submission of self to "serving 
others." Again, this is only bad 
when the same part of the popu­
lation does all of the sacrificing. 
It can only reflect on our own 
sense of self-worth when we (as 
women» say or think. "I wouldn't 
want a woman to operate on me. 
or manage my money." or ' I 
wouldn't vote for a woman for 
president." Also, what do we 
think of ourselves when we ac­
cept unequal pay and promotion.
Gaining insight into how we 
have been raised to look at our­
selves is only a small first step. 
At some point we have to ask.
Does exploitation of women have 
anything in common with exploi­
tation of other groups?" Is 
women's liberation only an issue 
tor middle c lass college women?" 
There is so much we women need 
to think about. For a start come 
Saturday to the Morewood Rec­
reation Room at 12:30 p.m.

CIT FactorsC-MU Cinema*
The CIT College Council has ap­
proved the following programs:
, 11 For current sophomores and 
freshmen in CIT a 2.00 cumulative 
factor is required for graduation. 
This factor will be based only on 
the sophomore through senior 
vears. During these years the bas­
is for academic action will be a 
fc2.00. This rule will apply to both 
"the semester average and the 
cumulative average.
During the freshman year the 
factor for academic action is a
1.75 and will be considered on a 
semester by semester basis. A 
student with a factor of less than
1.75 for both semesters will nor­
mally be suspended.
No ‘ R ” grades will be counted 
$ in the cumulative average, how-
Avaliable after June 1st. Freshly dec­
orated, very comfortable furnished 
quarters for 5 graduate students. 2 
baths, 2 kitchens, yard, parking—

ever, all R's will appear on your 
permanent record. In order to 
graduate a student will be allow­
ed to accumulate no more than 
100 units of K" grades.
i‘2i Effective immediately tor 
all CIT students icujrent seniors 
included i. The minimum H&SS 
elective requirement for gradua­
tion is 84 units. This means that a 
current upper classman who took 
36 units the freshman year. 18 
units the sophomore year and 18 
more in the junior year needs only 
one 12 unit course in the senior 
year to complete the requirement.
Current sophomores, juniors 
and seniors no longer have to have 
a minor sequence of humanities 
in their junior and senior years. 
Fine Arts courses can be used to 
fill a humanities requirement. 
Some departments will require in­
troductory courses before allow­
ing free selection of courses with­
in that department.
t3» Revisions to the currícul­
ums in the EE and Math depart­
ments were approved. Students
in these departments should check 
with their department to get the 
details.
(4) The following new courses 
were approved :
Chemistry-Cellular Chemistry

chemistry of life processes. The 
structure of cells and their organ- 
eles such as the nucleus mito­
chondria. ribosomes and mem­
branes will be discussed mainly 
with the results from electron mi­
croscopy. Biochemistry will be 
correlated with structure and 
function where possible.
Physic—A First Course in Astron­

by Mike Harbadin
Film has experienced a revital­
ization during the past few years 
on college campuses all across 
the country. Student interest us­
ually ranges from study and cri­
ticism to production and direc­
tion in all types and forms of cine­
matic art. However, here at C- 
MU. where technically oriented 
and creative minds supposedly 
cross paths and "mingle in an ex­
hilarating intellectual culture. ” 
film is unestablished. The situa­
tion is indded paradoxical, for the 
wide interest in the scientific and 
expressive arts would seem to 
merit a curriculum in the cine­
matic art. a field which employs 
a multitude of technological skills 
and highly creative expressions. 
Unfortunately, interested and tal­
ented students are at a loss for 
film study here, save for a few 
scattered film courses.
Is there an alternative? Cer­
tainly — do it yourself. A few 
months back. Greg C a p 1 a n . 
George Kiniss and myself, real­
izing the lack of film courses and 
experimental film showings on 
campus, decided to set up an ex­
perimental film group on campus. 
Its purpose is to choose and show 
contemporary and * new wave” 
films. The profits from the show­
ings would be used to help film­
makers on this campus, so that 
they could develop a loosely-or­
ganized film workshop.
Meetings have been held and 
plans are underway for the coor­
dination of film showings, the 
publication of a film news letter 
listing film showings on campus 
and the surrounding area, and 
possibly plans for film festivals. 
This plan will take form next 
year, and its final realization and 
complete structure will be estab­
lished the year after.
Well, what about film courses7 
We are now planning a film work­
shop for next year, and the admin­
istration is being asked to help. 
Some faculty have offered their 
teaching services, as well as a 
tew outsiders who are interested, 
course offerings will include Bas­
ic Production Techniques. Hi>- 
tory ot Cinema, and Screenplay— 
>eminars and lectures, a-N well a> 
outside speakers will be on the 
program. These ollenngs are ten­
tative but the program in any 
form will be a progressive and 
creative experience. The ultimate 
goal of both the Film Coordinat­
ing Committee and the Film Work­
shop is to generate and promote 
enough interest in film to run an 
extra-curricular program from 
which they can formulate an offi­
cial film curriculum and request 
the administration to make it offi­
cial. Any interested faculty mem­
ber should contact Jean McCreary, 
Leon Katz or Marge Walker. Stu­
dents will be notified of progress 
at a later date.
That's the story. If you can wait 
awhile and grow with the film cur­
riculum. fine. Just do not expect 
any prize packages next year — 
everything we want we will have 
to make for ourselves. If you real­
ly want a film curriculum, start 
putting pressure on your advi­
sors for a better film curriculum.
Meanwhile, film interest is be­
ing nurtured by the fine and va­
ried films that are shown on and 
off of the campus. Film Arts, the 
Activities Board, the Y-series, 
the Metacurricular Committee, 
and the MDC series have provided 
the campus with some good mod­
ern and classic films.
The Activities Board sponsored 
the Kinetic Art series, which 
has been a worthwhile vehicle to 
show good modern films from for­
eign experimenters. The Activ­
ities Board will be showing appro­
ximately 30 films in the theatri­
cal class of The Fox, Rachel, 
Rachel, Bonnie and Clyde, and 
Camelot next year.
The Student Gallery gave a 
showing of experimental films 
last Thursday, 16th. Scott Bart­
lett’s Moon 1969 was the most ex­
citing color abstract film shown 
in which video tape and infinity 
sequences of images were photo­
graphed in Bartlett’s own secret 
way. Two brilliant films by Stan 
Brakhage (Sirius Remembered 
and Creeley-McClure) were shown 
and other shorts by Sadan. Omori, 
Kendall. Vanderbeek and Gerald 
Varney got a chance on this cam­
pus. Chuck Glassmire. an inde­
pendent film-maker here in Oak­
land. provided narration between 
reels. He aided the audience in 
appreciating each film.
The Carnegie Institute has 
created a fine program which of­
fers classics like Intolerance and 
The Mark of Zorro as well as sem­
inars with such contemporary 
film-makers as Jonas Mekas and 
Robert Breet (May 6).
Jonas Mekas is one of the four 
hundred and more underground 
film-makers in New York. He 
writes a critical column in the 
New York Times, faithfully cover­
ing the serious new films shown 
in the underground theaters.
His appearance with his Diary 
film (three-five hours long depend­
ing on the edition) was the great 
est filmic event this year in Pitts­
burgh. His films are beyond the 
traditional critical approach. They 
are to be seen; to be experienced.
Mekas successfully uses his 
camera as a eye with emotional 
reactions to its subjects and ma­
terial. utalizing the camera’s en­
tire range of image projection: 
under-focused to over-focused, un­
der-exposed to over-exposed, slow 
action to fast action.
The emotions are fell. The Di­
ary reads easily and beautifully.

Track Team Cops Four Straight 
Manon Sets Record; Squad 5-2
By Jim Tomayko
The Tartans won as many meets last week as they had in each of the preceeding two seas­
ons, downing W & J 85-59, Western Reserve 91-54, and St. Francis 101-44. Monday’s visit to Alleg­
heny was tougher, but C-MU made it four in a row, 76-69, bringing the overall record to 5-2 
and assuring the best season in severa years.
The story at Allegheny, as at 
each of Carnegie's other contests'/c 
was the runners: eight wins out 
of nine events entered. And among 
the runners. Jon Manon was super­
lative again. Jon sliced his own 
school record in the three mile 
by thirteen seconds by running 
it in 15:39.8. This was his last 
event of the day. He already won 
the half-mile in 2:03.8 and “jog­
ged" to a win in the mile in 4:49.
In this latter event. Manon and 
Steve Hawkins demolished the 
field of ten by the end of the first 
quarter, and finished together.
Steve was later second to Jon in 
the three mile at 16:03. Joe Lor- 
han. who had won the last three 
half-miles, also succumbed to 
Manons prowess and finished 
second in the two-lapper' (2:06).
The sprinters were having an 
excellent afternoon in their own 
right. Despite the loss of Mike 
Fotta due to a muscle injury, 
the re-shuffled 440 relay team 
combined blistering exchanges 
and leg speed to run the fastest 
relay for the y?ar (44.lt. Mem­
bers of this relay team reappear­
ed regularly during the meet to 
take the 100 (Dave Venzie. 10.4). 
the 220 (Venzie again i. and the 
440 (Chuck Ednie. 52.0 and the 
fastest this year). The other two 
relayers. Jay Corpus and Me Don- 
ough. placed in the 100 and 220 
respectively. Henry Finch, most­
ly a jumper but a newly-discov­
ered hurdler, sped the 440 hurd­
les in 59.7 to win. The school 
record is 58.4. Carnegie's only 
loss was the high hurdles. In ad­
dition the mile relay was forfeit­
ed because the meet had been won 
by that time and Coach Meckley 
did not want to overwork the 
sprinters needlessly in the chilly 
weather.
Carnegie did manage two wins 
in the field events. Mark Erskine 
extended his victories by taking 
the vault at 11'8". Mark has gone 
a foot above this' but the wind 
conditions at the field were poor.
Wendell Miller won the high jump 
at 510 ". equaling his highest 
clearance of the year.
Golfers Get 
First Victory
The Flamboyant Golf team 
logged its first team victory Tues­
day with a cuff hanging match 
with Western Reserve. Sam Jams 
turned in astellar performance 
to beat his opponent in the 18 hole 
match and picked up one point.
George Smith and Doug Stone 
teamed up for 3 points which 
gave the Tartans the 5 points 
needed to defeat W. R.. 5 to 4 So 
far. superb play by the opponents 
and tough breaks on unfamiliar 
golf courses leave the Tartans 
with a 1-6 record

Saturday’s match with St Fran­
cis was almost unbelievably easy 
tor Tech. CMU won all the match­
es while losing a total of only 19 
games. None of the matches went 
into three sets. The closest match 
was a 6-3. 6-3 win by the doubles 
team of John Herre and Steve 
Osher over St. Francis' Magura- 
Garguild.
The St. Vincent match on Tues­
day was a repeat performance 
of the St. Francis match. Once 
again no CMU player was extend­
ed to three sets. The only differ­
ence was that Khan played first 
doubles with Myers, Smith teamed 
up with Herre at second doubles, 
and Osher and Agatston played 
third doubles.
Coach Dave Lichtman s squad 
has four more matches remain­
ing otv. ^ schedule this year. 
The flettixs battled at Allegheny 
yesterday, and play their next 
match against Geneva at home on 
Tuesday. With the toughest comp­
etition over the team is capable 
of dinishing the year with a per­
fect 10-0 record.
Jon Manon and Steve Hawkins take an early lead in the 3 mile race 
at Allegheny. The Tartan track squad won, 76-69 and Manon set a 
school record.

Wins five. six. and seven came 
easily for the CMC Tennis team 
last week. On Wednesday the 
team took a 7-2 grudge match 
against W&J. Then they came 
back on Saturday to humiliate St.
Francis 9-0 and on Tuesday they 
shut Out St. Vincent 9-0.
The W & J team was the only 
opponent to defeat the CMU squad 
last year. That loss snapped a
22 match winning streak extend­
ing over three seasons. This year 
the team was working on a new 
string of victories and was deter­
mined not to let W & J stand in 
its way.
Javed Khan. Joe Gordon. Phil 
Meyers, and Steve Foreman won 
their individual matches and also 
teamed up to net two victories 
in the doubles competition. John 
Herre also won his singles match 
but he and Rick Smith lost a tough 
doubles match to Jacobson and 
Drowne in near darkness. Drowne 
also beat CMU's Jim Osher in 
the only single s loss for the Tar­
tans.
