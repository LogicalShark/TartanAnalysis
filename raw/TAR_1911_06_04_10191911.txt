WHY DO WE STILL WALK THE 
MUDDY TRAIL?
That is the Question? Why do We?
A certain gentleman from this part 
of the world is reported to have got- 
teen up in the House of Representa­
tives and asked the question, “What 
are, Mr. Speaker, these United 
Slates?” We would like to paraphrase 
his query and ask, “Why do we, the 
Faculty and student-body, walk the 
Mudd> Trail?” To be required to an­
swer either of the above interroga­
tions we should not desire but that 
they can be answered if one knew 
the combination goes without saying. 
One thing is certain, it takes a long 
while to find the answer. Some weeks 
ago, two to be exact, we, in our hum­
ble waj, called attention to the mons­
trosity and even became courageous 
enoi’^h to offer a solution. But, alas 
we :>till walk the way of mud and 
mud trains, in rains and shines, with­
out comfort or succor.
It is with much sorrow that we feel 
the necessity of appending that pa­
thetic picture which you can find 
somewhere in this issue. (After the 
way of last week’s issue was treated 
by the artist in the composition room 
we won’t attempt to say just where.) 
The sorrow we feel is not caused by 
the extra expense of making the cut, 
as you may have hastily concluded, 
1 at by the fact that we must so cut 
the tender feelings of our dear and 
gentle readers by exposing such a hor­
rible sight. True, so many of us are 
by this time hardened to it that it pro­
duces no effect. It is for the other 
members of the student-body that we
feel. The Faculty feel also, particu­
larly the ones who are forced to walk 
over this unspeakable place every day 
in the week. One member said that he 
had to give up keeping his shoes 
shined because of it. Think of that, 
will you? The idea that such a state 
of affairs can exist around an institu­
tion of learning? Yet another member 
at first said that he could not make 
any statements for the press (that’s 
us) but finally dropped a hint to see 
his wife. We did. She had very strong 
opinions on the subject. She said that 
they had had, to the present time, no 
less than six and a half maids, the 
half one being a young girl of sixteen 
taken as a last resort, and that they 
were looking for another. They, the 
maids, refused to work in a house 
where the mister came in the clean 
hall with such dirty shoes. Ponder 
still some more on that and answer, 
if you can, “Why do we walk the 
Muddy Trail?”
A joke is a joke, sometimes, and is 
all right in its place. But this is no 
time for a joke. It is not right that 
those who use Woodlawn avenue as a 
means of entrance should be forced 
to wade through all that mud and 
shale in order to reach the buildings. 
At night it is a hundred times worse 
than by day as there are no lights 
by which to pick the rocks and ties. 
If there was any reason why it was im­
possible to put down a small board 
walk the situation would not be so 
intolerable. But there is none that 
we know of. There is plenty of room 
along side of the tracks to lay a walk 
equal in width to the one running 
for the barn to the Science Build­
ing, and we hope by next issue to an­
nounce with much joy that it has been 
done.
VICTORY NUMBER TWO
Carnegie Beats Geneva.
Carnegie Tech Varsity won the sec­
ond game of the season from Geneva 
College by the low score of 5 to 0. 
Much as we would like to say that our 
team outplayed the visitors, candor 
compels us to admit that the smile of 
Dame Fortune was all that saved the 
day.
The game itself was interesting, 
and consisted of all varieties of foot­
ball. Close play predominated, but 
no sensational gains were made by 
either team. Carnegie Tech failed 
miserably on the forward pass, ad­
vancing the ball but once, although 
the play was tried repeatedly. On 
the other hand, Geneva worked the 
throw successfully seven times for 
small gains netting a total of 60 yards.
The greatest gains were made on 
punts and at times the game appeared 
to be a kicking contest between 
Schmucker and Dodds, with the hon­
ors about even. Each man averaged 
35 yards for the game.
The crowd in attendance was larger 
than at the first game, and gave con­
tinual evidence of partisanship. 
Geneva was represented by a small 
gathering in the bleachers, who were 
heard shouting constant encourage­
ment to their beloved “Jenny-wa” 
gladiators. According to the usual 
custom, between the second and the 
third quarters the Carnegie rooters 
gathered on the field and participated 
in the snake-dance, led by the stu­
dent band. A giant block “C” was 
formed and a hearty “Locomotive” 
shattered the air.. Before the lead­
ers could call for the usual cheer for 
the visitors, some weak voiced rooter

TAN DISTRIBUTION.
What to do with Material for Publi­
cation.
For the convenience of the students 
and to facilitate in the handling, the 
management of the TARTAN an­
nounces the following additions to 
the places and times at which copies 
can be secured. It is hoped that all 
will take note of the nearest place that 
copies can be had and the time that 
it is open. If you will see to it that 
you get your copy there it will be ap­
preciated by the management. The 
experience of the past week has shown 
that many students either did not 
know the hours at which TARTANS 
could be obtained or they choose to 
disregard those hours, applying for 
their copies at whatever time they 
saw fit. Hereafter you can obtain 
your copy only at hours and places 
given in the list below.
THURSDAYS. 
Industries Bldg., Room 1.
1:00 to 3:00 P. M. and 7:00 to 7:40 
7:00 to 7:30 P. M.
P. M.
Science Bldg., Room 51.
1:00 to 3:30 P. M. and 10:00 to 10:40

FRIDAYS. 
Industries Bldg., Room 1.
8:30 to 9:00 A. M. and 10:00 to 10:40 
P. M.
Science Bldg., Room 51.
7:00 to 7:30 P. M.
Be sure and have your card 
with you as no TARTANS can be 
given to anyone without. This is a 
hard and fast rule made necessary and 
we can make no exceptions to it.
Turning in Material.
There still seems to be a question 
in the minds of some what to do with 
material they desire to have published 
in the TARTAN. As explained in 
the first issue, there is an Associate 
Editor from each of the schools who 
has charge of all material from and 
relating to his respective school. If 
the subject has something to do with 
the interests of your department the 
better plan is to hand it directly to 
the Associate Editor from your school. 
This saves time and assures more im­
mediate attention. If that is not pos­
sible drop it in the TARTAN box in 
your building on or before Friday at 
4:00 P. M., at which time the Editor 
will make his collection. The article 
should be written as legibly as possi­
ble on one side of the paper only. If 
there are more than one sheet number 
them. The TARTAN is very glad to 
receive articles and will acknowledge 
all that are signed by the writer’s 
name and section. We would like to 
see more and more articles handed in 
each week.

MORE ABOUT CHEERING.
Last week we rather congratulated 
ourselves on the cheering displayed 
at the Waynesburg game and predict­
ed great things in that line in the 
games to come. We are very sorry 
but after Saturday’s exhibition we cart 
not express pleasure nor hold out the 
same expectations for the cheering 
at the remainder of the games.
In the first place, the cheer leaders 
were not followed by the men in the 
stands and naturally the result was not 
that of combined and harmonious ef­
fort. It should be remembered that 
the men who are acting as leaders 
were elected to their positions and 
that you should therefore follow them. 
They are not down in front because 
they have any great desire to be there 
but because it is their duty. When 
you go and cheer all by your little 
self do you think that you are doing 
the “square” thing?
In the second place a football 
game is not the place for class 
or departmental feeling to be 
shown. Last Saturday altogether too 
much of that sort of thing was in evi­
dence. For a class to sit together is 
all right but for a large body of stu­
dents to refuse to cheer because the 
leader happened to come from a dif­
ferent school is not right. It should 
be stopped and it is up to YOU to 
see to it.
In the third place the numbers of 
those creatures with an assine wit 
seems to have added to in some mys­
terious way. Never before have we 
been so unfortunate as to have so 
much of it. It is deplorable to think 
that decent and self-respecting peo­
ple with more or less intellect should 
be forced to listen to that sort of thing 
in order to see a football game. Here 
it is up to YOU to put a stop to it. j 
No one else can do it but the men.j
who sit in the immediate vicinity of 
the bug and they should do it, out of 
respect for themselves if for no other 
reason.
That a good cheering practice is 
needed goes without saying and it is 
hoped that cheer leaders are success­
ful in arranging one in the very near 
future. Once more, it would then be 
up to YOU to be there.
—o—
UNSPORTSMAN-LIKE TACTICS.
When some unsport?man-l;ke inci­
dent occurs on a field of contest other 
than ours we hold up our hands in 
holy horror, as we justly should. We 
are none too careful, however, that 
our own skirts do not trail in the mire 
while we are so doing. Such was the 
case last Saturday. For a body of 
students to yell and jeer at an oppos­
ing player because of his race is just 
as unsportsman-like as it is for the 
opposing players to so far forget 
themselves as to fight one another. 
Let us see that in the future such an 
incident does not occur on a Carnegie 
field.
—o—
CARNEGIE OR TECH.
Sometime in the dim past the very 
good suggestion was made that in 
speaking of our Alma Mater we use 
the word Carnegie instead of Tech, 
the argument being that it was more 
distinctive. It was followed for some 
short while and since then we have 
all gradually drifted back into the use 
of Tech sometimes and Carnegie Tech 
at others. Now, at the beginning of 
a new year, is a very good time to 
start anew.
There can be no denying the fact 
that about Tech there is nothing to 
distinguish us from the dozens of 
other Techs about the country. In 
making the statement that you are 
from Tech you almost invariably ex­
plain just what Tech, especially if you 
are in the neighborhood of some other 
Tech than our own. On the other 
hand, in the word Carnegie we have 
a name that can not possibly be con­
fused with any other. It is distinc­
tive. It is particular to us and to us 
alone. It is the word most used in 
our cheeers and songs. It is as easily 
said and is much more euphonious. 
Therefore, let us use it in the near fu­
ture and distinguish ourselves there­
by from the common herd for Techs 
about this broad land. The TAR­
TAN, as a starter, undertakes to use 
it exclusively and begs the student- 
body, the managers of activities, and 
those in charge of publicity work for 
the organizations to follow its hum­
ble example.
—o---
We are not prepared to say just 
how it happened. The foreman in 
the composing room may be a sober 
Chinaman or a drunk Irishman. We 
can not say as to that. In the future, 
however, we won’t let it happen, de­
spite its decided advantage as an in­
genuity tickler. We are referring to 
the “pied” condition of the last issue.
—o—
You may stick in the Muddy Trail 
but you won’t stick by it.
That novel feature of the new De­
sign Building, the “six inches, inscrib­
ed with a brief description of an ar­
chitectural style and its development,” 
certainly will be as novel as the de­
scriptions will be brief.
—o—
It is fortunate that the Design 
Freshmen could gaze upon Mr. El­
bert Hubbard so early in their career. 
It should insure a good crop of tem­
peraments
—o—
It is fortunate for the success of the 
Faculty Golf Tournament that the 
contestants do not have to go the 
Muddy Trail to reach the links.
—o—
If it is not possible to build the 
walk, why not run “Old Breakage 
Fee” up and down teh Trail to roll 
it smooth?
—o—
If the student-body as a whole 
would show the same spirit as the 
band there would be no cause for 
complaint.
—o—
It is rumored that large sums of 
money are being placed on the result 
of the Faculty Tournament.

NOTICE—This calendar is a week­
ly feature, run for the benefit of the 
student body. Any society or club 
having a meeting is requested to drop 
a notice, giving date, time and place, 
in a Tartan box, before Friday at 8:00 
P. M., and it will be added to the 
Calendar in its proper position.
A Theatre and a Newspaper.
We read much these days of the 
power of the advertisers over the 
Press and the manner in which it is 
used. One of the big weeklies re­
cently conducted a long investigation 
of the subject and published the re­
sults in a series of articles which 
furnished interesting reading to say 
the least. We hear so much of that 
side of the story that it is refreshing 
to occasionally know of the other 
side.
Those that are interested in the 
theatre and are at all observing have 
noticed that one of the local theatres 
receives no mention in the write-ups 
of the foremost critic in Pittsburgh. 
It will also have been noticed that in 
the advertising columns this paper 
carries no advertisement for the thea­
tre. These two facts are full of mean­
ing.
This critic has long acquired a repu­
tation for fearless and honest work and 
what ever he may have to say about 
a particular entertainment is a crite­
rion in a great many homes. In his 
criticism of some rather questionable 
performances given last spring he spoke 
his mind. That financial injury was 
done the theatre was unquestionably 
and, by strange coincidence, the ad­
vertisements of the theatre giving 
these performances was, we noticed, 
taken out of the paper. Even to us, 
on the outside, it was evident that 
the so-called “big stick” was being 
brought into play and, remembering 
the fate of the New York critic such 
x short time previous, we feared the 
outcome. It was not, however, as we 
thought but a complete ignoring of 
the theatre by the newspaper. The 
same conditions of affairs exists today. 
Unquestionable the theatre loses 
money by such warfare, as does the 
newspaper to a lesser extent, and the 
pressure brought to bear on the mana­
ger of the paper must be great. We 
are glad, proud in fact, to see a man 
refuse to sell his opinions and to see a 
newspaper back up such a man in his 
fight. More power to both of them. 
Such men are needed today and this 
single instance shows they are not 
lacking. That they are in the city of 
Pittsburgh is our good fortune.

THE TARTAN3
DEAN McGOODWIN RETURNS
Dean McGoodwin, of the School of 
Applied Design, has returned to Pitts­
burgh and Carnegie Tech after an ab­
sence of about five months. Mr. Mc­
Goodwin, accompanied by Mrs. Mc­
Goodwin, spent the past summer in 
Europe. On Thursday of last week, 
Prof Hewlett, who has been acting 
dean since the opening of school this 
fall, gave way in the duties of that 
office to Dean McGoodwin.* * *
An Archaeology esquisse was given 
out Saturday with the subject, “A
Small Ball Room in the Adam Style.”
The rendu will be on January 14.* * *
The Design School was visited dur­
ing the past week by Mr. Lord, senior 
member of the architectural firm of 
Lord and Hewlett. It was intended 
that Mr. Lord give the students a talk 
during Mr. Hornbostel’s lecture hour, 
but he was delayed in reaching the 
city, and the pleasure of hearing him 
lecture, had to be foregone.
TALK BY MR. McCOLLOUGH
On Thursday of last week the De­
sign students listened to a very spir­
ited talk by Mr. McCollough, the ath­
letic director. Mr. McCollough urged 
the men of the Design School to show 
more interest in the athletics of the 
school, explaining how their co-oper­
ation in the forthcoming track meet 
for the Hammerschlag trophy would 
make it of more interest. Rivalry and 
the participation in the meet by all 
three schools can alone make it most 
successful,
Mr. McCollough explained that 
some of the best track men of the 
school have been and are of the Ap­
plied Design School, but they now 
and always have, lacked the support 
of the moderately able men.
It is to be hoped that Mr. McCol- 
lough’s talk will bring out the needed 
material to prevent the Science School 
winning the trophy for the third time. 
Competition always adds an interest 
to athletics.
THE NUMBER OF CARS 
IN THIS COUNTRY
Attempts have frequently been made 
to estimate the number of motor-cars 
now in use in the United States, but 
they have varied widely. A railroad 
official recently asked the question of 
the New York Journal of Commerce 
and that paper undertook to obtain 
from well-informed quarters the most 
careful estimate possible. From 
sources equally trustworthy it secured 
estimates that ranged from 400,000 
cars to nearly 550,000.
There has also been an absence of 
accepted estimates of the total value 
of the cars in use. In the trade a care­
ful canvass has put the average cost 
at about $1,200. Assuming this to be 
approximately correct, it would appear 
that there is locked up in automobiles 
today a total that ranges from about 
$474,000,000 to about $650,000,000.
ALUMNI NOTES.
It was good to see the large num­
ber of graduates who turned out to 
the Waynesburg game a week ago. 
The support of the alumni means a 
great deal to the coaches and players 
as well as to the cheering section.

FACULTY GOLF TOURNAMENT 
STARTS SATURDAY MORNING
First Sixteen to Qualify.
The first pair in the Faculty golf 
tournament will drive off Saturday 
morning at 10:00 o’clock, the drawing 
being made Thursday afternoon. The 
first sixteen cards will qualify. Great 
interest has been aroused over this 
event and the matches should be very 
close, the handicap committee having 
gone to great pains in making up the 
handicap list. Several members of 
the Faculty have handed in very good 
cards to the committee, all of which 
promises well for an exciting tourna­
ment.
Some of the members of the Fac­
ulty entered have never played over 
the course of the Pittsburgh Golf Club 
and the handicap Committee would 
appreciate very much if such men 
would do so at once, not only to 
familarize themselves with the course 
but in order that the handicap already 
alloted may be changed if necessary 
to assure a close result. The best 
hours for playing over the course are 
between 12:00 and 2:00.
I It has been suggested both by mem­
bers of the Faculty and the student 
body, that a student tournament be 
run off at the same time an that the 
winners of these two tournaments play 
for the Fall championship. Mr. Milli­
gan, in Mr. Orbin’s office room 117 In­
dustries Bldg. has kindly consented 
to take all names and cards of students 
desiring to enter this contest. It is 
to be hoped that enough will enter 
to make it interesting. Handicaps will 
be given to assure a fair chance to 
all. The names should be given to 
Mr. Milligan by Monday noon next 
in order that the play may start on 
the following Thursday.

4THE TARTAN
APPLIED INDUSTRIES NOTES
The Industrial editor of the “Tar­
tan” urges each class in Applied In­
dustries, to select at once a “Tartan” 
representative to see that all matters 
pertaining to their class are properly 
written up and deposited in the “Tar­
tan” box. This box is on the first 
floor and under the bulletin board. 
By doing this every class is assured 
of having an authentic account of their 
actions published in the school peri­
odical. It is only in this way that the 
various interesting happenings which 
the general editor is unable to obtain, 
can be collected. If your class or club 
holds a meeting, let us know about 
it, let us know what you are doing. 
By doing this you are also bringing 
your School into prominence. Do it 
now.* * *
The shafting, for operating the 
lathes described in the preceding is­
sue, is being erected by the students

MAD DOG.
On Monday, the ninth, when the 
Soph Electricals were peacefully recit­
ing Math, a rabid dog, with black 
spots and a low growl, entered the 
room. Rison, attempting to eject the 
animal, gave it a well-directed kick; 
but the brute turned and lunged at 
his throat, acquiring a large mouthful 
of coat and arm. After he had thrown 
the dog out by the neck, Rison con­
sulted Dr. Marx and had his arm cau­
terized.
There is no doubt in the minds of 
the Electricals, that the dog was mati, 
for he was seen shortly afterwards in 
the Architects’ drafting room.
Prof. Post was also attacked by this 
same mad dog. He may recover but 
he’ll never look the same.
SOPH CLASS MEETING.
A Sophomore class meeting was 
held on Monday, Oct 9. It was given 
chiefly to discussion of financial ques­
tions.
MHO CLUB.
Election of Officers and Other Mat­
ters of Interest Discussed.
The Mho Club held their first regu­
lar meeting Wednesday evening, Octo­
ber 11th, in Room 121. After election 
of officers for the first term, Mr. Den­
nison gave a short talk on the value 
of an organization of this character, 
from the technical as well as the 
social standpoint. The Sophomores 
were then unanimously elected to 
membership. After a further short 
business discussion, the meeting ad­
journed, and the members proceeded 
to do justice to the “feed.”
The following officers were elected:
President—M. L. Paterson.
Vice President—J. R. Gearhart.
Secretary-Treasurer—W C. Brand.
Executive Committee—H. H. John­

BOARD OF CONTROL MEETING
Changes in Articles Governing the 
Award of Insignia.
The Board of Control of the Ath­
letic Association held its first meeting 
of the year Wednesday evening, 
October 11. President Blanchard oc­
cupied the chair and called the meet­
ing to order. The committee on the 
revision of the constitution recom­
mended some changes of insignia, 
whice were authorized by the board. 
These changes define the requirements 
necessary for the award of insignia 
more clearly, but do not materially 
change the requirements.
The report of the baseball manager

Planned for the School Year.
On Thursday evening,October 12th, 
after classes, the Second Year Night 
Class, Science, held a short but enthu­
siastic meeting for the purpose of 
electing officers for the ensuing year. 
Wilson, one of last year’s officers, 
presided as chairman at the election, 
the following men being chosen:
President—Mark C. Smith.
Vice President—E. H. Wilson.
Secretary-Treasurer—S. W. Koenig.

It is planned by the Second Year 
Night men to hold several smokers 
and theatre parties during the present 
school year. The banquet held just 
after the close of school last May at 
the Hotel Henry was a decided suc­
cess, and it is hoped that as equally 
successful a year will be had as last.

COMPASSES WITHOUT 
MAGNETS.
The employment of the gyroscsopic 
compass in the German Navy and its 
reported introduction into the English 
Navy furnished evidence that this de­
vice has now passed from the experi­
mental into the commercial stage. In 
it we have a device that will indicate 
true north instead of the incorrect 
and variable “magnetic north” of the 
old compass; that will not have to be 
“adjusted” by a tedious process at the 
beginning of every voyage; that can 
not be deranged by electric storms or 
magnetic changes on board, and that 
seeks its pole with greater force and 
certainty than the magnetic compass. 
It is affected, to be sure, by perturbing 
causes that do not have to be consid 
ered in the case of the older instru­
ment; but these are easily calculated 
and discounted. We translate an ac­
count of the newest form of the in­
strument from an illustrated article 
contributed to “Cosmos” (Paris, 
August 12), by H. Marchand. Says 
this writer:
“The gyroscope is a well-known in­
strument and few are now ignorant 
of its fundamental laws, first complete­
ly defined by the great physicist, Fou­
cault.
“The first of these laws is that every 
gyroscope that is free to move in all 
directions tends to preserve its initial 
direction, and the second is that if a 
gyroscope is free to move in only two 
planes it must, at every point on the 
earth’s surface except the poles, tend 
to set parallel to the earth’s axis and 
consequently indicate the absolute 
north.
“A system of this kind avoids the 
causes of error that may influence the 
magnetic compass, and so the idea of 
using it in navigation has naturally 
attracted the attention of investiga­
tors, especially since the wide use of 
steel for shipbuilding has caused great 
difficulties in the use of magnetic in­
struments.
“But the means formerly at our 
disposal did not admit of giving the 
instrument a practically satisfactory 
form, and the numerous scientific men 
who have attacked the subject since 
Foucault’s time have not obtained 
much success.
“A German experimenter, Dr. An­
schutz, has nevertheless succeeded in 
devising a gyroscopic apparatus an­
swering practical purposes.
The problem, however, was a delicate 
one; a serious inconvenience resultea 
from the fact that such a device is 
affected, in ordinary conditions, not 
only by the earth’s rotation, but also 
by all the forces to which it may be 
subjected because of the ship’s mo­
tions. To attain good results it was 
absolutely necessary that the compass 
should have what is called great gyro­
scopic resistance, opposing powerfully 
every effort to displace its axis, and 
that the friction of the system of sus­
pension should be as slight as pos­
sible. Even so, however, the instru­
ment does not return to its normal 
position for a considerable time, and 
after oscillation to one side and the 
other of this position; and in the inter­
val it is exposed to new causes of per­
turbation.
“The great point was then to com­
bine the gyroscope with some device 
to damp its oscillations. Anschutz 
first tried to use a second gyroscope; 
later, he found the solution in a simp­
ler and more efficient device. His 
gyroscope compass, tested in 1908, on 
the Deutchland, has since ‘been used 
in the German Navy, and it is to be 
adopted also in the English Navy; 
others will doubtless follow their ex­
ample.”—Translation made for “The 
Literary Digest.”

6THE TARTAN
Continued from Page 1 
started for the grand stand and the 
stampede was precipitated sooner 
than expected. The cheering showed 
decided improvement and was marred 
only by some hoodlums, who appar­
ently cannot be squelched. The lead­
ers’ squad worked hard and varied the 
yells in a creditable manner.
During the first quarter, Geneva 
twice threatened our goal line, ad­
vancing the ball to the 20-yard line, 
and attempting to score field goals. 
Both attempts failed, resulting in 
touch-backs. In the two last quar­
ters the ball was in Geneva territory 
for the greater part of the time, never 
passing our 25-yard line.
The penalties imposed by the offi­
cials were a part of the game that 
caused great dissatisfaction among 
the enthusiasts of both sides. Each 
term was penalized for almost every 
offense known to the Rules Commit­
tee, including off-side play, tackling 
below the knees, use of hands in inter­
ference, and a number of others. 
While the officials are to be com­
mended for their watchfulnesss, many 
spectators condemned them as need­
lessly scrupulous.
Capt. Taylor won the toss-up, and 
chose to defend the eastern goal.
Schmucker caught the ball on the 
kick-off on the 5-yard line and re­
turned it 15 yards before losing it on 
a fumble. Nelson gained 3 yards and 
also lost the ball by fumbling. 
Schmucker kicked to the 30-yard line, 
and the ball was returned 15 yards by 
Carter, the speedy black tackle of the 
Beaver Falls College. Tech was pen­
alized 5 yards for tackling below the 
knees, and Clyde gained 2 yards. 
Geneva drew a penalty of 5 yards for 
off-side play. Cylde advanced the 
ball to 21 yards from the goal, and 
Dodds attempted to score a field goal, 
but missed, Kesselman recovering the 
ball. Schmucker punted from the 25- 
yard line to the Geneva’s 50-yard line, 
where Kesselman downed Dodds be­
fore he had advanced the ball. The 
remainder of the quarter was a suc­
cession of kicks, fumbles and penal­
ties with the ball see-sawing between 
the 30-yard lines. Blanchard was sent 
in for Lucas at quarter-back in this 
interval. Dodds caught a punt on Car­
negie’s 45-yard line and ran it back 
to his own 40-yard mark. Nelson 
gained a scant 2 yards, then Geneva 
worked their first forward pass, Dodds 
to Kelso, gaining 8 yards. A penalty 
for Tech of 5 yards, and a gain of 5 
more by Stewart, placed the ball on
Tech's 20-yard limit. From here Dodds 
attempted another field goal, which 
also failed, and the whistle ended the 
first quarter.
In the second quarter, after the ball 
had traveled in Tech’s territory for 
some time between 10 and 45-yard 
lines, Schmucker kicked from his 25- 
yard mark to the 40 mark on the 
opposite side. Balsinger gained 2 
yards after Blanchard had failed to 
gain, then Schmucker punted over the 
goal line. The ball was put into play 
on the 25-yard line and Geneva ad­
vanced it to the 40 mark, where they 
lost it on a fumble. Acheson, who 
was substituted for Kesselman, recov­
ered the ball and made 20 yards. Bal­
singer and Buck advanced the pigskin 
to the 10-yard line. Schmucker gained 
all but one foot on a line buck, and 
on the second try failed by 6 inches. 
The third attempt resulted in a fum­
ble, but Tech regained possession of 
the ball three yards from the goal. 
Schmucker again failed to make dis­
tance on the third down, and the pig­
skin went to Geneva on the 1-yard 
spot. Dodds attempted to punt, but 
Taylor blocked the kick, causing the 
ball to roll back of the goal line, where 
Crawford fell on it for the only touch­
down. Schmucker missed the try at 
goal.
The remainder of the game was fea­
tured by hard fought gains and kicks, 
with Geneva working the forward pass 
for small distances. The play was 
mainly in Geneva’s territory in the 
last half, showing a slight advantage 
for our men. At no time, however, 
was the ball within striking distance 
of either goal.

M. M. C. S. NOTES.
M iss Julia Richman, the District 
Superintendent of New York City, 
who came to Pittsburgh for the 
Teachers’ Institute, spoke to the stu­
dents last Friday, October sixth, on 
a subject which is vital to everyone; 
namely, the choice of a vocation.
This is best accomplished according 
to Miss Richman, by sitting down 
alone at a time when one is perfectly 
true with one’s self and classifying 
one’s qualifications in the following 
way: First, make a list of the things
that can be done well; second, make 
a list of the things that cannot be 
done at all, and third, make a list of 
the things one could learn to do; then 
select one’s vocation from the list of 
qualifications that can be done best 
of all and fit one’s self for that work 
no matter how humble it may be . “If 
it is only to scrub floors,” said Miss 
Richman, “scrub those floors better 
than they have ever been scrubbed be­
fore, so that it will be said, “that any 
one who can scrub floors like that 
can go a step higher and try the 
paint.’ ”* * *
The night school of the M. M. C. S. 
opened on Monday evening, October 
9.* * *
The first of the monthly meetings 
of the Alumni was held in the faculty 
parlors on Saturday, October 7. Miss 
West spoke on the Spree Wald, touch­
ing on their manners and customs. 
Tea was then served by one of the 
alumni, who was dressed in a costume 
of the Spree Wald people.* * *

FRESHMEN CLASS MEETING
A meeting was held on Thursday, 
October 12, which was well attended. 
Vice President Voelker conducted the 
meeting which was for the purpose of 
appointing committees, and electing 
Freshmen representative of the 
Tartan.
A very important meeting will be 
held on Friday, October 20, at 4:15, 
at which each and every Freshman is 
urged to attend to discuss very im­
portant matters.
JUNIOR BASKET BALL.
Chances of Having a Good Team are 
Very Bright.
On Wednesday, October 11, the first 
call for candidates for the basket ball 
team was made. About fifteen girls 
responded. They intend to practice 
every Wednesday after school.
Every girl in the class who has ever 
played basket ball should try for the 
team. Also any girls who wish to 
learn to play are urged to come. Do
not leave the work to be done by a 
few loyal girls, 'you yourself should 
help.
A second team is needed to produce 
a strong first team. The second team 
will have games of its own with the 
other two classes, just the same as the 
first team.
The chances of having a good team 
are very bright. All of last year’s six 
are back and also a few new girls 
who are very good at the game. We 
must maintain our name, for we are 
known as: “An Athletic Class,” but it 
means hard work, and not idle dreams.
Surely every girl in the Junior Class, 
whether she is interested in basket ball 
or not will attend the games and show 
her class spirit and loyalty. The girl 
who gets wildly enthusiastic over the 
boys’ game ought to be able to stir 
up at least a mild interest in the girls’.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
New Men Took Prominent Parts in 
the Matches.
The tennis tournament has advanced 
far enough during the past week to 
give a fairly good line on the probable 
results.
Some very gopd matches have been 
played, and it is pleasing to note that 
new men took prominent parts in 
these matches. The match between 
Savage and Fagan was a very long 
one, Savage losing the first set 11-9, 
but winning the next two comparative­
ly easy. Simpson had troubles of his 
own with Einstein, but Einstein 
showed that carrying a cane had a 
bad influence on his tennis arm when 
he lost 8-6, 6-2. One branch of the 
semifinals were played between 
Douthett and Savage, but in this case 
the “Savage” lost his scalp 6-1, 6-4.
Although there are still several 
matches to be played in the first 
round, good progress has been made 
The following men have won places 
in the second round:
Myers (default); Beeken (default); 
Kornblum defeated Tilton 6-4, 6-1; 
Douthett defeated Lauer 6-0, 6-1; Sav­
age defeated Fagan 9-11, 6-4, 6-1; 
Simpson defeated Einstein 8-6, 6-2.

“You look strong,” said Miss Anna­

“Equal to it, madam?” said the

FALL MEET SATURDAY.
Event Draws Out Many Athletes.
The big athletic event of the week 
will be the Fall Inter-school track 
and field meet on Saturday on Tech 
Field. Judging from the number of 
contestants entered, all of the events 
will be warmly fought for.
The three men’s schools are mani­
festing an unusual interest in track 
athletics for as late in the year, and 
have sent out a large bunch of ath­
letics to train for the contests. As 
usual, however, the Science students 
slightly out-number those from either 
of the other schools. This means 
that, unless the Design and the Indus­
tries men make a special effort, the 
meet will be one-sided.
While the Hammerschlag Trophy will 
not be put up as a prize until the 
Spring meet, the management is gen­
erously offering handsome rewards 
for individual prowess. These consist 
of gold buttons for first place men, sil­
ver buttons for second place men, and 
ribbons for third and fourth places. 
The men placing in this meet will rep­
resent the schools in events to be held 
during the winter.
As the football team will be play­
ing Muskingum College at New Con­
cord, Ohio, on Saturday, the meet 
will have supreme reign in the interest 
of Carnegie enthusiasts. Every stu­
dent should appear at the field prepar­
ed to root as hard and as faithfully 
as for the fcfotball team.
Second Assistant Managers.
At the recent school elections the 
following men were elected second as­
sistant managers of the Varsity foot­
ball team: Haaren, Design; Carney, 
Industry; and McGill, Science. These 
men will have charge of the inter­
class contests in their respective 
schools in addition to their duties con­
nected with the Varsity squad.
Scrubs Play Saturday.
On next Saturday the Carnegie 
Tech second team will meet the New 
Kensington High School football 
team at New Kensington. The schools’ 
best wishes go with them.

Announcement of Pittsburgh Orches­
tra Association.
The Pittsburgh Orchestra Associa­
tion wishes to announce, that, after a 
careful survey of the condition musi­
cal and financial of the city, and after 
considering such advice as was given 
in response to its request, it has been 
deemed inadvisable to attempt for the 
season of 1911-1912 the formation of 
a permanent orchestra. While keep­
ing this most desirable end in view, it 
has been decided to give five Sym­
phony Concerts at Soldiers’ Memorial 
Hall. Following are the dates and 
prices:
November 7, 1911, The Thomas Or­
chestra with Christine Miller.
December 11, 1911, Philadelphia Or­
chestra with either a violinist or a 
’cellist as soloist.
January 13, 1912, The Philharmonic 
Society of New York with Josuf Leh- 
vinne, the great pianist.
March 16, 1912, Minneapolis Sym­
phony Orchestra.
April 8, 1912, Boston Symphony Or­
chestra.

The Board urges early reservations 
of season seats, believing that as the 
season will be a very brilliant one, a 
great number of season seats will be 
desired.
Old subscribers may have their last 
season’s seats, if desired, by preferring 
an early request. If they wish other 
locations, their requests will be honor­
ed in the order of their reception.
AN EIGHT-WHEEL CAR.
This is “The Store” that 
sells The Best to be 
had for the Price.
A freak auto with eight wheels re­
cently brought to light, is declared to 
be “built on the principle of a Pullman, 
and the easiest riding car in the 
world.” It was designed by M. O. 
Reeves, who is President of a savings 
and trust company in Columbus, Ind. 
The principle, as described in “Motor 
World,” is that “three little bumps 
are easier to cushion than one big 
one.” It is claimed that the force of 
all jars and jolts has been reduced in 
this car one-half. Moreover, the con­
struction has enabled the builder 
to double the amount of springs em­
ployed. This reduces still further all 
vibrations. With eight tires instead 
of four to carry the load, lower air 
pressure in the tires can be used, thus 
softening all shocks.
Because of these three modifying 
factors it is claimed that the action 
of the eight-wheel car is something 
like that of a boat. Indeed, 
“it is impossible to get a se­
vere action on the body of this 
car in consequence of a jolt.” Mr. 
Reeves built one car after his plan, 
and has employed it for his own use 
during the past season. By the mid­
dle of September he had driven it 
nearly 5,000 miles. As to cost, he says 
it was about one-third greater than 
that of a four-wheeled car.
