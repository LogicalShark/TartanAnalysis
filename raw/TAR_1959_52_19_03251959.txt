Former Director 
To Conduct Kilties 
At April Concert
Wednesday, April 8th, at 8:15 
p.m., the Kiltie Concert Band will 
present their final performance of 
the year, a concert in Carnegie 
Music Hall. *
Following tradition, the evening 
will be opened by the colorful 
procession of the Pipers under the 
direction of Lewis Davidson.
Guest Conductor
As part of the Kiltie Band de­
union, the featured guest conduc­
tor will be Mr. William A. 
Schaefer, presently director of 
bands at the University of South­
ern California. Mr. Schaefer was 
director of the Kilties from 1947 
through 1952 and during that time 
was greatly responsible for ele­
vating our band to the nation­
wide reputation it holds today. He 
has chosen several of his latest 
transcriptions for the Kilties’ con­
cert, among which is the very de­
scriptive “Night on Bald Moun­
tain” by Moussorgsky.
Thomas E. Stelson
Thomas E. Stelson has recently been appointed head of the de­
partment of civil engineering, according to an announcement by B. 
Richard Teare, Jr., dean of the College of Engineering and Science. 
Dr. Stelson had been the acting head of the department for the past 
year and a half, since Dr. Frederic T. Mavis, former civil department 
head, left Tech to go to the University of Maryland. Dr. Stelson earned 
his B.S. in 1949 and M.S. in 1950 at Tech. In 1952 he received his D.Sc. 
from Tech and joined the faculty that year.
Carnegie Tech Receives Twin 
Research Grants From N.S.F.
CIT announced the receipt of two research grants 
amounting to $113,700 from the National Science Foundation 
last week. The grants are for the support of basic research 
in the department of physics and the Metals Research Lab­
oratory. ? ----------------------------------------------------
Dr. Sergio De Benedetti, Pro­
fessor of Physics, will direct re­

Gloria Cofsky Chosen 
Military Ball Queen
Last Friday evening, Gloria Cofsky, a junior secretarial 
major from Whitehall, Pittsburgh, was crowned queen of the 
Military Ball by Mr. H. Russell Bintzer, the vice president of 
the Tech’s development program. The crowning and con­
ferring of the rank of Honorary Regimental Commander 
upon Gloria climaxed several weeks of intensive work on the 
part of Scabbard and Blade, the national military honorary

ments in Reactive Metal Systems 
at High Temperature,” under the 
supervision of Dr. Charles L. Mc­
Cabe, Associate Professor of Met­
allurgical Engineering.
Dr. De Benedetti has been ac­
tive in research on positrons and 
the positronium since coming to 
Carnegie in 1949. Positrons are 
electrons of positive charge which 
associate with the usual negative 
electrons to form positronium, an 
atom similar in structure to the 
hydrogen atom, but almost two 
thousand times lighter. These 
particles can be used as a probe 
to investigate the internal struc-
ture of matter. The grant was 
made by the National Science 
Foundation to further current 
studies on the behavior of the 
positronium in matter, including 
its chemical properties.
Jackie Thurston, sophomore 
P&D, was honored with the rank 
of 1st battalion commander; Vivi­
enne Heinricher, the representa­
tive of Delta Delta Delta sorority 
with the rank of 2nd battalion 
commander; Sue Trustman, B 
tower’s representative and a soph­
omore acting major with the rank 
of 1st battalion staff officer; and 
Bea Alexander, Delta Gamma's 
junior music representative with 
the rank of 2nd battalion staff of­
ficer. These girls, as well as the 
runners up, are to be congratu­
lated.

Easter
Jesus, when on the cross, was heard to say seven words 
or phrases. One of these has been thought to be a momentary 
lapse of faith, an instant of despair, during the agony of the 
strangulation brought by crucifixion. But Jesus had been 
raised in a pious and orthodox family and was completely fa­
miliar with the scriptures as he had well-demonstrated in 
the Temple at the time of his twelfth year. It seems prob­
able that instead of crying out his loneliness, he was reciting 
this psalm, a parallel to his life and death, and a great hymn 
of praise to his God.
“My, God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why 
art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my 
roaring? O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest 
not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
“But thou are holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of 
Israel. Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou 
didst deliver them. They cried unto thee, and were delivered; 
they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
“But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and 
despised of the people. All they that see me laugh me to 
scorn: they shot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he 
trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him de­
liver him, seeing he delighted in him. But thou art he that 
took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I 
was upon my mother’s breasts. I was cast upon thee from 
the womb; thou art my God from my mother’s belly.
“But be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, 
haste thee to help me. Deliver my soul from the sword; my 
darling from the power of the dog. Save me from the lion’s 
mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
“ will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst 
of the congregation will I praise thee. Ye that fear the Lord, 
praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, 
all ye the seed of Israel. For he hath not despised nor ab­
horred the affiliction of the affilicted; neither hath he hid 
his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
“My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I 
will pay my vows before them that fear him. The meek shall 
eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord that seek him: 
your heart shall live for ever. All the ends of the world shall 
remember and turn unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of 
the nations shall worship before thee.
“For the kingdom is the Lord’s: and he is the governor 
among the nations. All they that be fat upon earth shall eat 
and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow 
before him: and none can keep alive his own soul. A seed 
shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a gener- 
tion. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness 
unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.”
"What's a nice girl like you doing in such a cheap show?'
Scotch ’n Soda 
Traces History 
To 1907 Group
By Bill Pence
William Eythe, Alex Segal, Jen­
nie Lou Law, Robert Casey, Bill 
McDonald, and Barbara Hall . . . 
Some of these names may be 
familiar—others may not. They 
are but a few of the thousands 
who are past members of Scotch 
’n Soda.
These three simple words stand 
for the title of an all-student or­
ganization which each year pre­
sents a completely original musi­
cal variety show. Students, ac­
cording to preference and ability, 
compose the score and lyrics, de­
sign sets and costumes, execute 
costumes, sets, and lights, carry 
out publicity, and act, sing, and 
dance.
All Phases
Although one would expect to 
find mostly music and drama 
majors participating, the club is 
composed of students of a vast 
variety of majors, for all gain 
valuable experience in some phase 
of the show, whether technical or 
aesthetic.
The history of Scotch ’n Soda 
goes all the way back to 1907 
when a club called the White 
Friars was organized for the pur­
pose of presenting a musical titled 
“All In a Dormitory.” The club 
existed until 1913 when World 
War I brought a suspension of its 
activities.
Tech remained without a musi­
cal club until 1932 when a group 
of students organized the Baccha­
nalians. Then, again changing its 
name in 1938 to Scotch ’n Soda, it 
presented its first production, No 
Strings.” During World War II the 
club was again forced to remain 
inactive, but returned again in 
1947 to present one of its most 
popular productions, “Rock and 
Riot.”
Unique
While collegiate “Variety 
Shows” are not unknown, Tech’s 
production can rightfully claim a 
place of its own at the top. Other 
educational institutions have their 
traditional musical groups, such 
as Pitt’s Cap and Gown, the Har­
vard Hasty Pudding Club, and 
the Princeton Triangle Club, but 
all are at least partly sponsored 
by the alumni and frequently 
alumni-written or directed.

“Each new assignment brings me greater 
responsibility and more challenging 
work. I have the satisfying feeling that 
I’m getting ahead in management,” says 
Charles F. Barefield, B.S.E.E., Alabama 
Polytechnic ’56. “That’s what I was look­
ing for when I joined Southern Bell 
Telephone and Telegraph Company.
“Following three months of interde­
partmental training, my next training step 
was as a supervisor in the Plant Depart­
ment. My assignments were varied to 
give me experience in handling technical 
and supervisory situations. In June, 
1957, within a year after joining the com­
pany, I was appointed Plant Foreman 
supervising a group of men responsible 
for telephone installation and mainte­
nance at Auburn, Alabama.”
Six months later—in January, 1958— 
Charlie became Transmission Supervisor 
in Birmingham. “This assignment in­
volves responsibility for accepting newly 
installed systems, analyzing performance 
and recommending modifications for im­
provement,” Charlie explains. “I work 
with the many different groups responsi­
ble for engineering, installation and 
operation of telephone circuits. These 
circuits range all the way from wires to 
microwave radio.
“I have been getting the variety and 
responsibility I looked for,” Charlie says. 
And he sees a bright future ahead for 
himself and Southern Bell. “The tele­
phone industry is growing fantastically 
and chances for advancement go along 
with growth,” he points out.

Falcons Win Title 
In IM Basketball
For the third straight season, 
an independent team has won the 
basketball championship in intra­
murals.
In contrast to previous years, 
was the placing of another inde­
pendent team in the second spot. 
However, two fraternity teams did 
finish among the top four.
Quarter Finals 
On Monday of last week, the 
Kappa Sigs played the Met Grads 
in the third quarterfinals game. 
The Met Grads were hot in the 
first quarter, and the result was 
a five point lead, 12-7. Reini Nor­
man accounted for six of the 
twelve. In the second quarter 
Jerry Watson, Jim Duffy, and 
Earl Benner led a rally which 
gave -KS a 3 point lead at half- 
time, 22-19.
Kappa Sig was able to main­
tain the lead throughout the third 
period as Watson and Mai Dowl­
ing helped build the lead up to 
eight points, 33-25. However, Bob 
Rapp and Norman got hot in the 
final quarter. The lead was cut 
down to one point as the buzzer 
sounded: final score, 37-36. High 
scorer for the game was Norman 
with 12, while Watson lead the 
victors with 11.
ATO - TDP 
On that same night the most 
interesting game of the quarter­
finals was played. It featured a 
hustling, scrappy Tau Delta Phi 
team versus ATO, the favorite. 
The first quarter and the second 
quarter was a see-saw battle as A1 
Wolfson, TDP, scored nine points 
and Steve Rothenberg five to 
five the Tau Delts a one point 
lead, 16-15, at intermission.
The second half was an even 
battle all the way as George 
Paris, ATO, with 7 points out- 
sccred Myles Hollander of TDP 
who had 6. The one point differ­
ence between these two was en­
ough to send the game into over­
time with the score at the end of 
regulation time 31-31.
In the three minute overtime 
Wolfson pumped in a jump shot 
with 45 seconds to go and this 
brought a win to the Tau Delts, 
33-32. Bdlihawking by Wolfson 
and lots of team hustle proved to 
be the difference between the Tau 
Delts and ATO. Wolfson was high 
scorer of the game with 15 points.
Semi-finals 
The win by the Tau Delts gave 
them a chance to play the Fal­
cons, a classy independent team.
The first quarter was an even 
tussle as Wolfson and Bennie 
Perlmutter matched Ed Horey 
and Jim Trageser, Falcons, point 
for point until the buzzer sound­
ed to stop the scoring at 12-12.
However, Kemp Beall, play- 
maker of the Falcons, hit three 
quick set shots in the second 
quarter which pulled his team 
ahead. This lead was the start of 
a route. Trageser and Horey took 
charge throughout the rest of the 
game to bring the final score to 
46-33. They scored 11 and 12 
points respectively to lead all 
scorers.
Second Game
In the second semifinals game 
of the night, the campus favor­
ites, Englishmen, met the Kappa 
Sigs. Similar to the game that 
preceded it, the Kappa Sigs scor­
ing pattern resembled TDP’s and 
the Englishmen’s the Falcons. 
Even the final scores were the 
same. In the first quarter, Ben­
ner mimicked Boyd Doxtader’s 
driving lay-ups to keep his team 
within two points of the English­
men. 14-12.
However, throughout the rest 
of the game Doxtader dominated 
the action as he scored on sev­
eral long jump shots to finish 
with 24 points for the night. A1 
Rolnik’s eight points in the sec­
ond half combined with Doxtad­
er’s scoring punch produced a 
final score of 46-33.
Consolation Game
The consolation game on Fri­
day, Intramural Night, not only 
determined the third place team 
in the tournament, but also the 
best fraternity team on campus. 
As on the other two occasions, 
the scoring power of the Tau 
Delts, Wolfson, Perlmutter, and 
Hollander, was ready to do prac­
tically all of the TDP scoring. 
The Tau Delts got off to an early 
lead, and never relinquished it. 
Two times in the second quarter 
KS tied the game, mainly be­
cause of the hustle of Hough and 
Watson, but the constant hustle 
and ballhawking of TDP, they 
regained the lead to be in front 
at halftime, 21-19.
During the third quarter Hol­
lander tied for high scoring hon­
ors with 12 apiece; Hough had 11 
points for the losers.
Championship Game
The final game was a real thril­
ler with a Frank Meriwell ending. 
The Englishmen started a rally 
right at the start of the game as

Jim Beisler led them to a quick 
14-6 lead. Doxtader took over 
from there with his numerous 
foul shot conversions and by 
midway the second quarter, the 
Englishmen led 23-12. However, 
at that point the complex of the 
game changed as Trageser and 
Horey began their 1-2 scoring 
punch which was to last for the 
rest of the game. The score at 
half time was 27-21.
The Englishmen did score the 
first basket in the second half, but 
Horey put on one of the best set 
shooting shows ever seen on the 
gym, even better than that by 
Ken Denne of Slippery Rock in 
a varsity game this year. Horey 
made three long sets to bring the 
Falcons to within two points of 
the Englishmen.
Victory
Then Jim Trageser took over 
with two nifty, driving lay-ups, 
followed by successful baskets by 
Horey and, again, Trageser. Me- 
halko broke the Falcons’ streak 
with a jump shot from the cor­
ner; however Horey and Trageser 
matched the Englishmen point for 
point the rest of the way to give 
the Falcons a 57-48 victory and 
the school championship.
A good bit of the credit for the 
victory should go to Kemp Beall’s 
playmaking and Dick Wainright’s 
and Fritz Schneidmiller’s re­
bounding. High scorers for the 
game were Horey with 24 and 
Trageser, 21. Valley, with 12, was 
high for the Englishmen.
Performances
In the tournament, five fellows 
stood out in turning in spectac­
ular performances. They are Mike 
Flynn, Ed Horey, Jim Trageser, 
Boyd Doxtader, and A1 Wolfson.
Mike scored 20 and 29 in two 
games and the 29 points were
against the Falcons. By himself 
he almost beat the Falcons twice 
this year. He also led the school 
this year in total points and high 
individual average.
Second High
Ed averaged 15 points a game 
in three playoff games he was in, 
and was responsible for the sec­
ond-half high spirit of the Fal­
cons in the title game. He was 
second in the school in total 
points and fourth in average.
Jim, who only played in half 
of his team’s league games, aver­
aged 16.0 points a game in the 
three playoff games, and was a 
take-charge fellow, especially 
when the other team double­
teamed Horey. He finished tenth 
in school average.
Doc got off to a slow start in 
the playoffs. He averaged 16.0 
points a game in the playoffs and 
like the other three, he put on a 
scoring show. He finished eighth 
in school averages.
A1 was the only one of the 
standouts not spectacular in scor­
ing. Although he did average 12.0 
points per game in the playoffs, 
he stood out with his 26 pass 
steals in the three tournament 
games and with his continuous 
hustle.
Other fellows who looked good 
in league play but did not get a 
chance to show their wares in 
playoffs were Bob Rapp, Enn Ep- 
ner, Otto Leone, and Bennie Pet- 
ran.
