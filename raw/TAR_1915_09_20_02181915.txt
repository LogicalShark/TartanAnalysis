PLAID fIVE MAKES FINE SHOWING
GYMNASIUM IS TAXED IO OVERfLOWIIK
The Junior men of the School of 
Applied Design and Science of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
gave their annual Prom Friday night 
in the ball room of the Hotel Schen- 
ley. The decorations, which were 
very attractive, consisted of autumn 
leaves, smilax, and Tartan plaid. The 
booths of the various clubs and fra­
ternities were arranged in the foyer 
of the ball room and were most taste­
fully furnished with lounges, chairs, 
ornamental lights and flowers. The 
following had booths: Sigma Tau,
Sigma Rho, Pi Chapter of Theta Xi, 
Delta Skull Junior Society, Woodlawn 
Club, Psi Sigma Upsilon, Zeta Lamb­
da Epsilon, Delta Phi, Beta Theta Ep­
silon, and the Junior class.
The grand march was led by Har­
old Heilman, president of the Junior 
class, of the Design School, and Miss 
Marie Woodruff. They were followed 
by W. W. Lauer, president of the Jun­
ior class of the Science School, with 
Mi ss Elizabeth Birchmore, and E. G. 
Merril with Miss Venita Kurtz. The 
receiving line included Mr. and Mrs. 
Samuel Harden Church, Director Ar­
thur Arton Hamerschlag, Dean John 
Hopkins Leete, of the School of Ap­
plied Science, Mrs. Leete; Dean Clif­
ford B. Connelley, of the School of 
Applied Industries, Mrs. Connelley; 
Dean Mary B. Breed, of the Margaret 
Morrison School, and Mr. and Mrs. 
H. J. McCorkle, representing the 
Alumni.
The music, which was the most en­
joyable that has been danced to at 
any of our dances this year, was fur­
nished by Scalzo’s Orchestra. The 
program consisted of thirty-four 
dances which lasted until four o’clock. 
Supper was served during the inter­
mission in the banquet room. The 
dance orders were very novel, con­
sisting of embossed leather card cases 
for the ladies, and leather diary covers 
for the men, also embossed with the 
school seal.
The Prom Committee included E.
G. Merrill, W. Earl Boak, Geo. B. 
Baker, Claude Ettele, Geo. A. Hays, 
L. Chillo Maier, Karl H. Fulton and 
Owen fu Southwell.

Secretary Field has been elected 
president of the Yale Scholarship 
Fund of the Western Pennsylvania 
Alumni Association of Yale Univer­
sity.
When Irvin Cobb got back from 
Belgium, he told of the way an Irish­
man described the effect of the .42 
centimeter German guns. “Furrst,” 
he says, “there wuz a divil of a big 
noise, an’ thin—an’ thin the nurrse 
sez, ‘Will ye have another dhrink of 
wather?’ ”
That’s about what happened to us 
when the fast Allegheny College Five 
swept down from Meadville, and add­
ed our scalp to those already dang­
ling from their belt. Nevertheless, it 
was a satisfaction to know that Tech 
made a better showing against Alle­
gheny than did Pitt last Friday even­
ing. We held them to one point less, 
and scored three more field goals than 
did our neighbors of the Hillside 
above Soldiers’ Memorial. Strange to 
relate, the score at the end of the 
first half was an exact duplication of 
the Pitt-Allegheny game.
It was a fast hard game, and the 
Tech players worked every minute. 
Henning and Hines deserve praise for 
their splendid defense, although we 
think Referee Mauthe was rather 
severe with them in the calling of 
fouls. Meredith’s reach was much in 
evidence when it came to blocking 
passes, and he also found the basket 
once from a difficult angle. Shiffer 
and Levy played their usual hard 
game, each scoring two field goals. 
Levy shot 9 out of 14 fouls.
But when it conies to playing bas­
ketball, you surely must hand it to 
the Allegheny boys. Cox was their 
bright particular star and repeatedly 
found the basket on long throws. 
When a team can throw field goals 
from deep center, and place them 
with the accuracy Allegheny’s men 
showed Saturday night, it takes a fine 
brand of basketball to even up mat­
ters, and although the score looks 
one-sided, it was a thrilling game, and 
Tech held the visitors to more than an 
even break in the second half.
Cox started the scoring for the vis­
itors, by making a point from the foul 
line, and Shiffer brought the crowd 
to their feet by scoring a basket a 
moment later, giving Tech a moment­
ary lead, and a feeling of assurance 
that it would be no walk-away. Levy 
then found the net on a foul throw, 
and Cox failed on his try from the 
foul line. Then Cox set off one of 
his skyrockets from deep center, and 
whether it was good-luck or accuracy 
we know not, the important point be­
ing that it landed safely in the net. 
Cox followed this up with several sue-

cessful throws from the foul line, and 
five minutes’ play saw the score stand 
Allegheny, 6; Tech, 3. Levy and Shif­
fer were much in evidence at this stage 
of th^^ame, and missed the net after 
relaying the ball the length of the 
floor. Bianci shot a rainbow from the 
sidelines, and a moment after Dunbar 
scored with a more or less lucky shot 
from the play-off right under Tech’s 
basket. Henning then missed what 
looked like a sure try for a basket. 
Cox took another long chance by 
winging one from the sidelines. Then 
the boys from Meadville started a reg­
ular bombardment of the Tech goal, 
and Cox scored again after three un­
successful tries. On a double foul Cox 
added two more points for his side. 
Shiffer then got busy and place a pret­
ty one from centre. Strenuous work 
followed and during the melee Hen­
ning took what appeared to be a run­
ning-board dive into the benches. For 
the moment it looked as though he 
might go down from the third time, 
but with a moment’s rest “Dutch” was 
back on his feet and in the thick of 
the fight. Cox scored on the resump­
tion of play, from the playoff in deep 
centre, and the half ended, Allegheny, 
19; Tech, 8.
By the time the second half started, 
the gym was taxed to its capacity in 
handling the crowd, which lined the 
walls and interfered somewhat with 
the play. It was the largest crowd at 
the gym this year, undoubtedly due to 
the splendid showing the boys have 
been making in the past few weeks, 
under the tutelage of the Wagners, 
A1 and Honus. The coaches expressed 
themselves as well satisfied with the 
showing made, realizing that in meet­
ing the Allegheny Five, they were go­
ing up against one of the best college 
basketball teams in the country.
Soon after the second half opened, 
Cox shot from the foul line, and his 
teammate, McKay, brought the score 
up to 22-8, with Tech on the short 
side. Hines made an unsuccessful 
try, and Levy brought a round of 
cheers by getting through Graham and 
shooting a pretty one. Business got 
exceedingly brisk right here, and 
Soissons and the River Aisne had 
nothing on the Tech gym for hard 
fighting. Tech played the Allegheny- 
ites off their feet at this stage, adding
8 points to their adversaries’ four. Had 
Tech been blessed with a little of the 
accuracy of the visitors the score 
might have been—well, we weren’t

The talk by George S. Swain, Pro­
fessor of Civil Engineering at Har­
vard, and, by the recent co-operative 
arrangement, at M. I. T., was an un­
expected treat enjoyed by the entire 
Science School on Monday, Febru­
ary 15, 1915. The speaker was intro­
duced by his life-long friend, Profes­
sor Mott, head of the Department of 
Civil Engineering of our school. 
Rather than a formal lecture, Profes­
sor Swain gave a talk from a few pages 
of his experience with life. He said 
in part as follows:
“Perseverance is not always a vir­
tue. There is not a single virtue that 
exists which cannot become a vice if 
misdirected. Unless you study your­
self, and find out what you are cut 
out for, perseverance is misdirected.
“Anyone of you can be a success if 
he wants to, and is willing to pay the 
price. Everything has its price, and 
you can have what you want if you 
will but pay for it.”
In referring to his own experience, 
the speaker said, “After graduating 
from Tech, I went abroad and there I 
had an eye-opener. I found in Ger­
many a whole field of engineering that 
I didn’t even know about. The few 
years that I spent in Europe did more 
for me than any other thing. It 
broadened my view, taught me that 
other people were just as good and 
perhaps a little bit better than we.
“There are too many men who come 
out of college thinking that they know 
more than other people, and who want 
large wages with nothing to do but to 
tell other people what to do. I think 
that you men here in Carnegie Tech 
come out with more respect for the 
fellow that works with his hands than

Carnegie has always tried to foster 
a spirit of true sportsmanship among 
its students and nowhere in its code 
of manners has it countenanced un- 
gentlemanly and discourteous conduct 
toward women. Yet at several of the 
basketball games, especially last Sat­
urday night, some thoughtless stu­
dents were unwilling to offer their 
seats to a number of ladies who were 
therefore compelled to stand during 
entire contests. Such action or rather 
inaction shows a lack of training and 
refinement on the part of the guilty 
individuals. We dislike to dwell fur­
ther on the subject. This hint should 
be sufficient to prevent a recurrence 
of any similar impolite conduct.

Actions sometimes speak louder 
than words, but words are often neces­
sary to cause action. There have 
been so many rumors and promises of 
a new stadium and gymnasium at Tech 
that hope for the realization of those 
assurances seem as bright as the pres­
ent prospect for peace in Europe. A 
recent article by a prominent Carne­
gie graduate which appeared in the 
second issue of The C. I. T. Alumnus, 
may, however, reopen the case. The 
suggestions offered by Mr. Halferty 
should receive the support of every 
one interested in the welfare of our 
rapidly growing institution. His ar­
ticle is reprinted in full for the benefit 
of the students who do not have ac­
cess to the Alumni publication:
THE TECH STADIUM.
Every body connected with or inter­
ested in athletics at Carnegie Institute 
of Technology has heard so much 
about the new field for Tech that it 
has begun to be more or less of a joke. 
As a matter of fact, it is a very serious 
matter if athletics are to be carried on 
in a way that will not reflect discredit 
on the Institution.
It is a well known fact that people 
judge a school by the success of its 
athletic teams, if they are made up of 
bonafide members in good standing 
in the school that they represent. 
Whether this sort of judgment is very 
sound or not is another matter, but 
we do know that we have to be guid­
ed by results.
In order to have good teams we 
must begin with the fundamentals: 
Namely, good material, competent 
coach and proper training facilities.
Good material is either developed in 
college or comes from some prep 
school pretty well developed. It is 
not necessarily the prep school star, 
but the fellow with natural ability and 
a head to keep up in his class work 
that is desirable at Tech. We are 
getting very few prep school athletes 
who are better than “fair” to enter 
our school.
When we consider the wonderful 
housing and equipment of every other 
department of the school the present 
athletic department does not fit in with 
the general scheme. When a prospec­
tive student inspects the schools he is 
awed by its wonderful completeness 
of every other department but the 
physical training and to most wide 
awake students, especially those ath­
letically inclined, this is like a dash of 
cold water.
A coach’s success is measured large­
ly by results, but the best of coaches 
cannot do much unless they have the 
material with which to work.
To retain a desirable coach at C. I. 
T. a man with good personality and 
a love for the boys and the work he 
is doing, must be paid a good salary.
The way it seems best to do at Tech 
is to get the man and then hustle for 
the money to pay him, all of which 
is not very good from a business 
standpoint. The proper way is to en­
able ourselves to figure on adequate 
gate receipts. To do this there are 
several things to consider.
In order to get the crowds we must 
have the best, for the public of Pitts­
burgh will not patronize second class 
attractions of any kind, and in the 
end it is the public we must look to 
for our finances to run athletics.
No school can support all major 
branches of athletics and expect the 
student body and the alumni associa­
tion to keep it going.
But one of the most essential things 
is an up-to-date gym and athletic sta­
dium. At present the training facili­
ties at Carnegie Tech are very poor. 
The gymnasium is by far too small to 
accommodate the number of students 
in our school who would like to take 
up physical training as it should be 
taken for the betterment of the stu­
dents’ health. In this course at pres­
ent there is little, if any, opportunity 
for competition, which is essential in 
any form of physical work, to make 
it interesting, as well as beneficial to 
the participants.
If the course included competition 
along different linos it is a certainty 
that many men, who are now over­
looked, would be developed for our 
different teams.
The crowds that come to our basket 
ball games more than tax the capacity. 
This is a case where we are losing 
money almost every game for the 
want of better accommodations. The 
seating capacity of our present grand­
stand does not nearly accommodate 
the football crowds. The grandstand 
in existence at present is seven years 
old and the lumber from which it was 
built was second hand, so you can see 
it is not in very safe condition. It 
would be a black eye to us to have 
any bad accident on our field. These 
conditions are very bad from a finan­
cial standpoint as well as discouraging 
to the spectators.
The worst condition is the size of 
the actual playing field. The present 
field is too small to permit the proper 
amount of work of baseball and track 
in the spring of the year. It is not 
very pleasant for an outfielder to have 
a hammer or a discus flying around 
his head or for a track man to be hit 
with a prospective homerun in some 
of the lively practice games of the 
baseball candidates.
The track coach cannot work his 
men as they should be worked. The 
track ordinarily, is too hard, this be­
ing due to the poor construction. If 
it rains any kind of a heavy rain, the 
track does not drain properly and is a 
sea of mud for the next few days.
The baseball players are more or 
less “stoved up” all season from the 
effects of the concrete like diamond on 
which they play and practice at home. 
The balls are only good for a few 
minutes after they are feathered and 
hard to handle.
The coach of this year’s football 
team was continually talking about the 
condition of the playing field. He 
could not scrimmage his men as he 
wished to do, and several of his plans 
could not be worked out. We will 
all agree to his knowledge of a field, 
judging by his knowledge of foot­
ball. When the team came out of 
the Lehigh and Pitt games the fel­
lows were in fine shape, but after our 
home games, there were always a num­
ber of injured players, which is an 
additional proof that we need a new 
field and need it badly right away, 
and every body that has any Tech 
spirit should get on the job and start 
something toward getting it.
Since the school first started in 1905, 
we have been looking at architectural 
sketches of the proposed athletic field, 
with the good looking bridge, at 
Moorewood Avenue entrance, over the 
much talked of gymnasium and the 
Union Club, said club to be the Holy

What we need in our new field is 
enough room for track and baseball 
without so much interference. This 
field should be built according to the 
approved ideas of experts on this par­
ticular line. A great many fields are 
spoiled in the first construction, either 
by poor drainage or poor soil or both. 
A track cannot be much good to the 
team if it is made of clinkers and 
mud, nor can a football field if it is 
made of clay. There are many very 
successful fields that we could pattern 
after, thus avoiding mistakes. The 
gymnasium should be properly equip­
ped in the same way.

we do. We can always consult the 
Director and his advice is generally 
pretty good “dope” to follow.
We can talk it up to everybody we 
come in contact with and if we all 
tell the other fellow how badly we 
need a new field, the new field will be 
forthcoming in the near future. It 
often happened in the fall of 1905 that 
we did not know where we were go­
ing to have such and such a class, as 
the plaster was not dry on the sched­
uled room. But our good friend, the 
Director, generally provided what we 
needed, and I believe if we impress 
him with the fact that we simply have 
to have that field, we will soon get it.
There are five city councilmen to 
be elected this year, taking office Jan­
uary 1, 1916, and before any of them 
should get a Tech vote or the vote 
of a friend of a Tech man, he should 
be made to promise to vote for a 
councilmanic bond issue to purchase 
and improve the property which we 
so foolishly tried to get by general 
bond issue a year or so ago. This 
is not fair to Tech, as a majority of 
the voters do not appreciate the ne­
cessity of the opening of Morewood 
avenue and what it will mean in way 
of access to Tech.
• It does seem strange that the city 
of Pittsburgh should spend thousands 
of dollars for the property on which 
the schools now stand and not give 
us the logical entrance, Morewood 
avenue, to the school.
When you are making your ar­
guments, don’t forget the fact that a 
nearby University received money 
enough to build a fine road and sev­
eral costly retaining walls, all of 
which cost more than would be neces­
sary to open and improve Morewood 
avenue.

Sentiment is a sure factor for the 
indication of better times but we take 
more willingly to concrete facts as 
they form a more positive indicator. 
Aside from a general wave of prosper­
ity for the new year various business 
transactions point directly to a 
“boom” era. Substantial improve­
ment in the steel trade has been re­
ported within the past few days and 
the steel mills of the Pittsburgh dis­
trict are now operating on a sixty-five 
(65) per cent basis, as compared to a 
month ago. The placing by the New 
York Central and Pennsylvania lines 
of large steel orders has been prompt­
ly followed by the booking of lesser 
orders by smaller roads. The Na­
tional Tube Company holds a large 
order for oil pipe lines to be used as 
conveyors of an oil line to be stretched 
from Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mex­
ico, while the “Iron Age” magazine 
reports a brisk buying by numerous 
gas companies. The war has furnished 
the American business man a new 
opening and through proper training 
and nursing of our merchant marine, 
a stable foreign trade can be 
grounded.

blessed with accuracy, that’s all. With 
seven minutes to play the score stood 
Allegheny, 31; Tech, 19. Bash re­
placed Bianci, and the fast work con­
tinued. Here time was taken out for 
Levy, who landed on his “funny- 
bone”. Play was resumed with forty- 
five seconds to go, and the game end­
ed, Allegheny, 33; Tech, 21u
In a preliminary game, the Tech 
Plebes fell before the onslaught of 
East Liberty Academy, by a score of 
28-16.
Artman was the chief point-maker 
for the E. L. A.’s, scoring six field 
goals and two fouls. Moon played a 
fast game and found the net five times. 
For the Plebes, Marshall was much in 
evidence with his blocking. “Shorty” 
Holzworth, whose long reach would 
go a long way against Zeppelin at­
tacks, essayed a John L. Sullivan atti­
tude on one occasion, much to the de­
light of the crowd, but the storm 
passed, and all efforts were confined 
to basketball.
The band was very much in evi­
dence, in their blue and gold, and 
helped materially in creating the feel­
ing of enthusiasm that pervaded the 
gathering. Merrill got good support 
from the cheering sections, in fact, the 
best showing made since the close of 
the football season. Dancing was in 
order until midnight.
Much could be accomplished by 
starting these events a little nearer 
schedule. The first game was some 
forty-five minutes late in beginning, 
and this brings the second game to a 
late close, curtailing the dancing per­
iod, especially for the visitors who 
desire to return home on the night 
trains.

Wednesday at eleven thirty o’clock, 
Mrs. Goodwin, of the Anti-Suffrag­
ette party, addressed the students 
and faculty of the Margaret Morri­
son School in the Assembly Hall.
Mrs. Goodwin was introduced by 
Miss Harding. Miss Harding was in­
troduced by Dean Breed as the old­
est, best, most interested and useful 
friend of our school. She was four 
years a teacher of History in Mar­
garet Morrison, and spoke most en­
couragingly to the girls. Mrs. Good­
win spoke most interestingly on the 
work of the Anti-Suffrage party. Mrs. 
Goodwin was at one time a suffrag­
ette, such was the interest she had 
in the women and children of this 
country. She felt that she could do 
more for them had the women the 
power to vote. In the last few years, 
however, she has taken a strong stand 
with the opposite party.
Her lecture was one of the most 
interesting we have had this year, and 
she presented the question of Wom­
an’s Suffrage in a clear, definite man­
ner and the student-body will look 
forward to the coming lecture in favor 
of suffrage with much interest.

Owing to a conflict on the social 
calendar the Shilling’s Valentine Par­
ty was postponed from last week to 
Monday, February fifteenth. The en­
tire school was invited to the Recrea­
tion Hall to enjoy an entertainment 
planned and executed by the Shilling 
Board.
There were valentines for everyone 
who came. Some were very elaborate 
and some were very crude. Then 
there was dancing and everyone did 
whatever they wanted to do and had 
a good time.
The refreshments consisted of ice 
cream cones and apples. The apples 
were a gift from Mrs. McConway to 
the Margaret Morrison girls.
The party was enjoyed by everyone 
who came, but the Board regrets that 
not more of the students found it pos­
sible to be present.
The second edition of the Shilling 
came out last Thursday. By the ef­
forts of the Board and especially An­
na Thomas, editor-in-chief, and Miss 
Parry, this Shilling surpasses either 
of the other publications. There are 
a number of copies yet unsold. The 
Shilling needs money. Show your 
spirit, girls, buy an extra copy and 
send it to someone at home.

A few weeks ago the Pan-Hellenic 
Association by unanimous vote de­
cided to open the Association to all 
organized sororities in the school. 
There are now six Pan-Hellenic so­
rorities and the association thinks 
that this move has been a most ad­
visable one and will greatly increase 
the democratic spirit of the sororities.
The regular annual Pan-Hellenic 
rushing season began Friday, January 
twenty-second and lasted for four 
weeks, closing Friday of last week. 
The date for the rushing was chosen 
so as not to conflict with school work 
starting as it did at the close of the 
examination season.
A number of attractive entertain­
ments have been held by the different 
sororities. Several dances and other 
functions were held in the Recreation 
Hall.

The new Davis Theatre, with its 
four grand entrances, one on Sixth 
avenue, another on Oliver avenue, the 
third from Smithfield street and the 
fourth from William Penn place, was 
thrown open to the public at the mat­
inee on Monday last.
The attraction next week, beginning 
Monday, February 22nd, Washington’s 
Birthday, will be the famous “Argyle 
Case”, which is one of the greatest 
mystery plays that has been seen on 
the American stage for many, many 
years. It is a play that is worth 
while and everybody should see it. 
It will be a great treat to see the in­
side of Mr. Davis’ new theatre because 
it is a beautiful playhouse.

That unique interpreter of native 
American character _ types, William

burgh playgoers at the Alvin Theater 
the week of February 22, with his 
equally popular role of Jim Whitman

Washington’s Birthday will usher 
into the Grand Opera House a week 
of vaudeville shows which will express 
the highest artistry of the varieties 
and the gayeties and melodies of mus­
ical comedy. Jesse L. Lasky, whose 
name awrakens recollections of the 
most brilliant ensemble attractions, 
will present “The Society Buds,” a 
complete opera in one act, with book 
and lyrics by Willia Le Baron and 
music by Robert Hood Powers.
Kremka Brothers will do eccentric 
acrobatics and half a dozen other at­
tractions, in addition to moving war 
pictures, will make up the week’s ros­
ter.
Vanderbilt has had the same coach 
for eleven years, and in the ten years

they were in their prime.

The Night Graphica got started 
Thursday evening, in a rather interest­
ing way. President Elliott being in 
t,e chair, he immediately started t,e 
machinery moving via the press anF 
entertainment committees and we ex­
pect to speed up from now on wit, a 
larger circulation than heretofore, 
which was near the zero mark, so we 
are using the revised copy. Mr. Gage 
always sticks around for the final O.

copy w,ic, t,e “compv” give t,e ou o

ADDRESSES STUDENTS
Continued from Page 1 
they do in other schools. It isn’t 
necessary to have a college education 
to be a success in engineering. It is 
a great advantage, but not necessary. 
Twenty-one out of forty-five presi­
dents of the American Society of Civil 
Engineers were not college gradu­
ates.
“In fact the older I get, the less I 
think of a college degree. When I 
hire a man, I don’t ask him what 
degree he has; I ask him where he 
studied, and if he says Carnegie Tech, 
I write to Professor Mott and ask him 
about the man.
“What are the qualities that make 
a man successful and happy in the 
world? Wisdom, judgment, a trained 
mind, experience, knowledge, charac­
ter, and such inherent qualities as tact. 
It seems to me that in our colleges 
nowadays We lay too much slress on 
knowledge. They consider the stu­
dents as pitchers to be filled with just 
so much knowledge. A trained mind 
is far more important than knowledge 
for you can turn that mind to any 
problem that presents itself, and tackle 
it logically.
“You hear a good bit about college 
bread, what is this college bread? It 
has been defined as ‘A Four Year’s 
Loaf.’ That comes nearer to being 
the truth than you may realize, but I 
don’t think that it is so much the case 
here. (At this point a burst of laugh­
ter showed that the students agreed 
with the speaker in his qualification.) 
A friend of mine asked his nephew 
‘What did you take in your Senior 
year at college?’ The nephew replied 
‘Zoology, Botany, Anthropology, and 
Fine Arts.’ After some questioning, 
trying to find out why this queer com­
bination was chosen, the interrogator 
learned that this was the only possible 
arrangement of courses that would 
allow enough credits to graduate, and 
at the same time leave every afternoon 
free with no morning classes before 
ten o’clock.
“If we engineers want to be appre­
ciated, as we shall be, we will have 
to do something beside study engin­
eering. The engineer must learn to 
mix and talk intelligently with any­
one. Study economics and human na­
ture. I recommend to you men that 
you study history. Start now, lay out
a course, and read all the time. A 
contractor once said to me, ‘I can 
hire brains very cheap; what costs 
money is administrative ability, men 
who can handle men. I recommend 
to you that you read biography, and 
see what definite lessons you can 
learn from this or that man’s experi­
ence. True wisdom comes from look­
ing backward.
“I am very fond of an illustration.
I say that a school is not a restaurant, 
where the bill of fare is brought and 
placed before you to fill you up; but 
rather that a school is a gymnasium 
where all kinds of apparatus for 
strengthening your body and mind 
are placed before you, and you can 
use them for good or evil. So it is 
up to you to develop your powers of 
will, and to so use your energies that 
they may make you successful and a 
good to your fellow men.”

The clubs rendered several selec­
tions at the concert for the benefit 
of Italian earthquake sufferers last 
Sunday in the Duquesne Gardens. The 
next concert will be at Irwin, Pa., on 
Wednesday, the 10th. The clubs are 
working hard on several new selec­
tions for the Home Concert, on March 
12th, and no effort will be spared to 
make it the best one ever held.
The Musical Clubs took the first 
big trip of the season during Inspec­
tion Week, playing Mannington and 
Moundsville, W. Va. They left on 
the B. and O., 1:30 p. m. Monday, the 
1st, and arrived in Moundsville about 
six, after a hard trip from Wheeling 
in a crowded trolley car. All were 
rounded up from the homes of various 
fair ones in time to play to a crowded 
house. After the performance there 
were small gatherings at different pri­
vate houses, which held forth until 
broken up by irate parents. A large 
party took a trip through the peni­
tentiary the next morning. When 
they saw the sights that instilled the 
fear of the law into them, at least all 
but the plebes. After dinner at the 
hotel, in which the first were last and 
the last first, the good ship “Carnegie” 
set sail for Mannington, arriving there 
at 5 p. m.
Mannington is fortunate in possess­
ing a large illuminated clock on the 
tower of the High School. This serves 
as a light house to wandering stu­
dents, and guides them through the 
dangerous schools. It was a bad night 
but the hall was filled.
During the whole trip the proverbial 
egg was seen but once and that was 
when the club was bombarded by a 
detachment of the Allies, while wait­
ing for the train out of Mannington. 
Those on the trip were: Glee Club— 
First Tenors—J. A. Cameron, C. B.

A novel contest for supremacy was 
introduced when the glee clubs of 
Harvard, Columbia, Dartmouth and 
Pennsylvania met. The prize, a li­
brary of music, wa£ awarded to Har­
vard.
A total of 616 votes cast from all 
over the United States, China, South 
Africa and the Philippines was re­
corded in the election of the new 
members of the Board of Trustees of 
Kentucky State University. The votes 
were cast by alumni and graduates 
were put in control of the university. 
Six alumni were thus added to the 
Board of Trustees.
After giving the plan of starting 
the morning session at 8:45 instead 
of 8:15 a week’s trial, the faculty of 
Western Reserve University have de­
cided to resume the old schedule. The 
many inconveniences resulting from 
the innovation did not warrant the 
change. The professors put the pop­
ularity of the late start up to a vote 
of the different classes and without 
exception the great majority of the 
students were against it.
The Franklin Institute at Philadel­
phia has founded a new award, known 
as the Franklin medal. This medal 
will be awarded from time to time, not 
for particular inventions or discov­
eries, but rather for long, faithful and 
fruitful work in the field of practical 
science.

The Department of Dramatic Arts 
in the School of Applied Design has 
secured the services of B. Iden Payne 
as visiting instructor to help in the 
development of one of the plays which 
will be shown shortly. Mr. Payne 
was stage director in Mansfield, Eng­
land. Last year he was stage director 
in the Fine Arts Theatre, Chicago, 
and recently has been playing in Phil­
adelphia and New York. His experi­
ence and talent shall surely count for 
a great deal in helping the students 
master the theatrical profession.
The Department of Dramatic Arts 
in the School of Applied Design has 
also secured the services of Mr. E. 
P. Sherry, of Milwaukee, as visiting 
instructor for Friday, February 12th, 
to help direct the staging of “The 
Neighbors,” by Zona Gale. Mr. Sherry
is director of the Wisconsin players 
with headquarters in Milwaukee.

The returns from the Class B judg­
ment were received last Wednesday. 
In plan the school did not get a first 
mention, but five men proposed for 
first mentions, H. L. Heilman, G. W. 
Meyers, Klingensmith, H. L. Smith 
and G. A. Spachman. The first men­
tions in the “orders” were T. P. Leng- 
felder, C. A. Gaus and R. M. Marlier. 
All the remainder received mentions.
Mr. Sternfeldt, who was Carnegie’s 
representative of the jury, expressed 
a desire for more time to be spent on 
studying and presentation of our pro­
jets. He said that they should have a 
more snappy rendering. The Beaux 
Arts also expressed the desire on 
measured drawing was preferably a 
house on notable building rather than 
casts which have been very numerous.
As we are and act in college, so will 
we continue after we are out, is the 
idea expressed in a recent editorial 
in the Ohio State Lantern. These are 
some of the qualities of an alumnus 
who graduated last spring:
“He came to college with a purpose 
worth while.
He learned how to plan his time so 
that every minute was used for some­
thing.
He took care of his health by proper 
exercises, good food, recreation and 
plenty of sleep.”
He broadened his interests by tak­
ing an active part in school activities.
He cultivated his sympathies by do­
ing things for his fellows.
We should all put these rules to 
effect and use them to good advan­
tage.

ior law class of the University of Colo­

The following, clipped from the 
Pennsylvanian, is an extract from the 
Statistical Review of the 1914 season 
by Parke H. Davis, of the Interna­
tional Rules Committee:
“Intercollegiate football during the 
past season was played by 450 col­
leges, 6,000 secondary schools and by
1,500 teams not connected with edu­
cational institutions, but representing 
organized athletic associations, large 
and small. Thirty-four thousand 
games were played and 152,000 players 
participated in the sport. Notwith­
standing the distraction of war and 
the handicap of tight money, from 
every section come reports of in­
creased attendance. Estimates place 
the total number of spectators attend­
ing football games in the United 
States during the fall of 1914 at 6,292,-
000 persons. The culminating assem­
blage, of course, was at the Harvard- 
Yale game at New Haven, where al­
most seventy thousand people gath­
ered and occupied almost twenty-nine 
miles of seats.
“In the vast network of schedules 
overspreading the entire country it is 
almost impossible to select the vari­
ous sectional champions without rely­
ing to some extent upon the consen­
sus of local critical opinion. A fair 
selection of the best teams in the 
principal football sections of the coun­
try is believed to be as follows: East,
Harvard; Middle West, Illinois; Ohio, 
Ohio State; Missouri Valley, Nebras­
ka; South Atlantic, Virginia and 
Washington and Lee; Pacific North­
west, Washington University; Middle 
South, Tennessee; Southwest, Okla­
homa; South, Auburn; Southeast, 
Texas.

“The greatest point scorer and 
touchdown maker of the year was E. 
N. Mayer, of Virginia, who made 19 
touchdowns and kicked 7 goals from 
touchdown, accumulating 121 points. 
Second was Charles Barrett, of Cor­
nell, with a record of 19 goals from 
touchdown, 12 touchdowns and 4 
goals from the field, a total of 105 
points.
“The largest total of scores against 
all opponents, amazing in its propor­
tions, comes from the west, where 
Rolla, formerly known as the Mis­
souri School of Mines, amassed the 
huge sum of 560 points against their
opponent’s none. In the East the chief 
exponent of heavy scoring was the 
very remarkable team of Washington 
and Jefferson. The Everett High 
School team, which met the best teams 
of four states, including a representa­
tive team from New York City, De 
Witt Clinton, and another from Chi­
cago, Oak Park, defeated all by 600 
points to none. Only five teams 
passed the 300 mark with their scores 
in 1914. These teams were: Everett
High, 600 to 0; Rolla, 560 to 0; W. 
and J., 369 to 54; Virginia, 319 to 25; 
W. and L., 313 to 12.
“The foremost field goal man in the 
United States in point of numbers of 
goals kicked during the season was 
W. C. Cahall, of Lehigh, with a record 
of ten goals for the season, all from 
drop-kicks. Second was L. L. Lamb, 
of Pennsylvania State, with six goals, 
all from placement.
“To H. V. Halligan, of Nebraska, 
goes the honor of having kicked the 
most goals in one game, three, against 
Iowa.
“The premier punting honor brings 
forward two players, each with a dif­
ferent claim to first place. Eels, of 
Williams, in the game against Wes­
leyan, sent one punt a distance of 76 
yards and maintained an average 
throughout the game of 53 yards. Le 
Gore, of Yale, however, made his 
longest punt against Colgate, 67 yards, 
but against Princeton, with a total of
11 punts, amassed the enormous punt­
ing average of 55 yards.
“In the East, M. D. Fleming, of 
Washington and Jefferson, carries off 
the honor by having kicked the most 
goals following touchdowns, 39 out of 
53 attempts. Sharing first place with 
him is Lloyd Bletzer, of Mt. Union, 
who was given 37 opportunities to ne­
gotiate the kick and successfully 
kicked the entire 37. Next to these 
men are parks, of Tufts, with 28, and 
Pudrith, of Dartmouth, with 27.”
Princeton University may have a 
course of military instruction during 
the second term if a scheme now be­
ing discussed takes definite shape. The 
movement started with a small body 
of students, who submitted a petition 
to the faculty requesting that such a 
departure be made.
A committee of the faculty was ap­
pointed and it announced that if a 
sufficient number of students was be­
hind the movement it would report 
favorably. Nearly five hundred stu­
dents have signed the petition asking 
for the formation of a military com­
pany, and it is probable that the course 
will be begun in February.
Through the generosity of Samuel 
Insull, of Chicago, the Franklin Insti­
tute of Philadelphia, founded a new 
award for contributions of individuals 
to science or to the applications of 
physical science to industry. The 
prize, which will be known as the 
Franklin Meral, has an intrinsic value 
of $75. There are to be at least two 
prizes each year.
The New York State College of 
Forestry at Syracuse University has 
been presented with a new building.
W. S. Hamnett ’08, Metal., is now 
in charge of the district comprising 
Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, 
for the Pittsburgh Testing Labora­
tories. “Buck” Thompson ’08, has 
taken Hamnett’s former position at 
Dallas, Texas.
Wm. H. King, Jr., ’10, Arch., has 
opened an office in the Home Build­
ing of this city.
“Jake” Siegle, ’13, Mech., was in this 
city over last Sunday, coming from 
Youngstown.
C. E. Gilson, ’14, Mech., has been 
transferred to the New York office of 
the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.
G. W. Ketter, ’09, Civil, has gone to 
Lebanon, Pa., to supervise the erec­
tion of an electric furnace by the Leb­
anon Steel Co.
The Mahoning & Shenango section 
of the Alumni Association held a 
meeting in Youngstown, Ohio, Feb­
ruary 6th. About twenty men were 
present, including H. J. McCorkle and 
Director Hamerschlag, who gave in­
formal talks. Arrangements were 
made to produce the school films be­
fore the Youngstown Chamber of 
Commerce.

The Metallurgists working with 
feverish haste under the guidance of 
one Prof. Macintosh have found a 
new steel (not steal) which will here­
after be known under the new name 
of “Tech Steel.” Whether it will be 
open hearth Tech steel or not is not 
definitely settled but the fact remains 
that on Thursday last, the metallurg­
ists succeeded in producing steel by 
means of one of their large electric 
furnaces.
$100,000 having been granted to the 
University of Iowa by the State board, 
a new dental building will be started 
at once.

Tech men are urged to attend the 
large anti-military mass meeting to 
be held February 19 at Carnegie Lec­
ture Hall. This meeting, which is be­
ing conducted under the auspices of 
the C. I. T. Economic Society and a 
similar Pitt organization, promises to 
be the banner event of this year in 
meetings of this character. Some of 
the most promising speakers of the 
present time have been secured and 
will ably uphold their end of the meet­
ing if the students and outsiders will 
do their share.
Among the speakers are Prof. Alan 
Willett, of Tech, Chancellor McCor­
mick, of Pitt, and Dr. J. Leonard Levy, 
the well known peace advocate. Each 
one of these men is a master of the 
art of speaking and also well versed 
in the world-peace movement. Dr. 
Acheson, of the Pennsylvania College 
for Women, has also kindly consented 
to speak and everyone may be sure of 
some good spicy remarks from him.
It is up to the Tech men, therefore, 
to turn out in full force and show Pitt 
we have a good crowd, because Pitt 
fellows will be there strong. So every­
body be there and bring a friend. No 
admission and no collection taken.

Next Saturday night the basketball 
team meets the Hiram College quintet 
on the opponents’ floor, and from all 
present indications ought to be vic­
torious. Although it is hard to tell 
exactly what kind of a game our op­
ponents will play it can be clearly seen 
from recent scores, that their team is 
not playing up to form. Last Friday 
night, Hiram opposed Duquesne Uni­
versity and was decisively defeated, 50 
to 26. In spite of the large score they 
at times played good ball. Saturday 
night they faced Grove City and once 
more were overwhelmingly defeated, 
41 to 17. However, it is hard to tell 
by scores what the outcome of t,e 
game will be. Hiram may take a con­
siderable brace and give Carnegie t,e 
fight of her life. At any rate, v,e will 
make the game interesting.
Last Saturday Carnegie put up an 
excellent game against Allegheny. 
Although the pace set by the Mead- 
ville aggregation was fast and furious, 
Carnegie kept up to them and in the 
last half played as well if not better. 
If they keep on playing the brand of 
basketball which they displayed 
against Bethany, Westinghouse Club, 
and Allegheny, they are almost sure to 
come out ahead in next Saturday’s 
contest.

Dr. Marks, the Consulting Physi­
cian, has changed his office from the 
gym. to the Industries Building, where 
he shares the office of Dr. Esquerre. 
His old office in the gymnasium will 
be used as a room for corrective gym­
nastics, by Mr. McCulloch.
The treasurer of the Athletic Asso­
ciation, Mr. Applegate, has also left 
the gym, and may now be found in 
the Head Building, third floor, in the 
same office as the Graduate Manager, 
and the Secretary of the Alumni As­

Dear Sir:
I have been somewhat mystified and 
at a loss to understand why some en­
terprising student has not asked Doc­
tor Hamerschlag for the privilege of 
selling and distributing evening papers 
at the schools.
He could have his papers delivered 
at the schools, have three or more 
stands with people making their own 
change, deliver others to the various 
rooms of the faculty, or any other 
plan that looked good to him.
Trusting the suggestion may be 
profitable to some one, I beg to re­
main,
Sincerely yours,

The most interesting part was the 
nail and wire mills. In the nail mill 
one machine alone makes 480 nails 
per minute. In the wire mills, barbed 
wire is made. The plant is so busy 
that they have men working all the 
time turning out the barbed wire for 
shipment to Europe.
As one of the members of the party 
expressed it, they are working hard 
in one place to make the wire, while 
other places are working harder yet 
to make tools and weapons to destroy 
it.
