TO DISCUSS MINES
Whiting Williams, author o£ 
'‘What’s on :the Worker’s Mind,” 
¦who has just returned from the 
mines of France and Germany, is 
spending two -weeks on th'e Tech 
campus^ He has been secured to 
give special instruction in certain 
advanced classes and has consented 
to sipeak at the Student Assembly 
at 11:30 today, Wednesday, in the 
Carnegie Music Hall. The subject 
of his address will be “The Adven 
tures of a Miner in the Saar Val­
ley.”

About three years ago Mr. 'Wil­
liams gave up his, white collar po­
sition as Personnel Directoi and 
Vice President of a great steel com­
pany in Cleveland, donned overalls, 
put $25.00 in his pocket, assumed 
an alias and ^ hunted a job. Since 
then he has worked for several 
months each year as a common, un­
skilled laborer in the mills and 
mines of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Eng­
land, France and Germany. During 
•this time he ate and slept and lived 
as one of the laborers with whom he 
worked.
Mr. Williams gave a course of 
lectures here last winter, and they 
were so valuable that he was in­
vited Ho return. ,• Tlijis sujnim^r’s 
experiences in the Saar Valley, and 
in the mines and mills, of other parts 
of France and in Germany, should 
make his present series of lectures 
even more worth while. Mr. Wil- 
liafs is a forceful speaker and his 
lectures are replete with first-hand 
•impressions, graphic descriptions 
and a compelling human interest.
On Wednesday evening of next 
week he is to give a talk at a Fa­
culty Slub Smoker, on the subject 
“Disarmament and the Worker.” 
His other engagements include an

THE ODYSSEY 
OF A BUMMER
Or, Penn State in Nineteen 
Lifts
PLANS BEGUN FOR 
ARTS COSTUME BALL
Arts Ball—who hasn’t heard of it? 
Even up in 'lil ole New York, last 
year, they admitted' that it surpass­
ed the artists’ ball of that town. And 
when metropolitan newspapers send 
special reporters here to write it 
up—well, it can hardly be classified 
as a ordinary Saturday night dance. 
No, it is THE ibiggest event in the 
entire year for the Division of Arts 
at Tech, being an annual affair and 
limited exclusively to* students at 
Arts.
This year will mark the eighth an­
nual ball and it early promises to 
surpass even last year’s epoch mark­
ing event—“The Land of Enchant­
ments.” This mystic land of en­
chantments, which form the ball 
took last year, was the realms of 
the immortals that had lived for 
ages in the imagination of humans. 
The walls of the foyer and main 
entrance were hung with blue drap­
eries having strking, rich, grotesque 
designs and green, gold, yellow and 
red with the ceiling lighted to har­
monize. Amidst these surroundings, 
typical of the balls of Valhalla, there 
mingled all the gods, banshees, 
witches, dwarfs and fairies of the 
Norse legend, Scandinavian, Celtic; 
Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon folk lore 
—all assembled for a night of rev­
elry.
As,the gong struck four the night 
ended and they returned to their 
haunts.
All the work was done by stu­
dents even to the designing and ex­
ecuting of the varied costumes, no 
two of the five hundred being the 
same.
That was the ball of last year.
The type of ball for this year 
has not been very1 much discussed, 
as yet.
One plan which seems quite at­
tractive is the representation of 
the Fete of Bagdad, or a street 
scene in Bafdad. As it is a big sea- 
/ (Continued on Page Four.)
After listening to about ’steen dif­
ferent fellows just back from a well- 
known bumming trip start out: 
“Say, you should have been with us 
instead of on that Special,” we got 
tired of that line and told them to 
write it uip for The Tartan and hand it 
in by Sunday evening. That had 
the desired effect on most of them, 
but several stories did come in, and 
when we tried to pawn them off on 
the editor he came back and said 
there wasn't room for all of them, 
but that we should take them and 
write something about the whole 
bunch of them,, and turn that in 
for the first page. We think that 
when he gets this, lie’ll change his 
mind about the first page, and won’t 
give us any more assignments at 
11:30 p. m. on a Sunday evening.
But say, that gang that went up 
without the necessary fourteen dol­
lars or a Dad for a railroader sure 
must have had one -peach of a good 
time while they were at it. Most 
everyone cussed some when he hit 
the. town again, but from what they 
say no one had to walk very darn 
far, considering the whole distance 
covered^ and everyone hopes we 
play State again next year. Like 
the one fellow ¦wrote, Lady Luck 
would, smile on them and then Lady 
Luclc would lose herself again till 
Henry Ford came along, and helped 
out two blistered feet.
Most of Llie gang rode to Trafford 
City or some such outlying point be­
fore starting to waylay the unsus­
pecting llivverer, ibut some went as 
far as Greensburg before starting 
to walk the highways. They say it 
was harder to get started than it 
was to keep going once you got a 
ways, which seems quite reasonable, 
and can be sworn to by anyone who 
ever coasted down an icy hill.
•It would be interesting indeed to 
compile a complete story of these 
Odysseys, “Penn State m nineteen 
lifts” and “Penn State or Bust— 
We didn't Bust” or “The Corduroy 
Twins’—the latter a whole volume. 
When it comes to 'being among the 
lucky ones, the gang of six that se­
cured a hundred and ten mile lift

FIRST DISCUSSION ON
INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATING
On Thursday afternoon at 4:30 
o’clock, a body of men met in the 
Y. M. C. A. room for the purpose 
of discussing the possibility of in­
tercollegiate debating at Tech.
Mr. Peterson, last year’s coach of 
the debating team, addressed the 
men and outlined. the work of an 
organization for this activity/ He 
impressed upon the, men what a de­
bating team really meant and said 
that there was no reason why Tech 
could not have as good a team as 
any of the other colleges. He as­
sured the men that there were now 
five colleges who' have asked Teen 
for a meet and felt positive that 
many more could be listed. He al­
so said that in order to have a good 
team he had to have the co-opera­
tion of the organization, and that 
hard work was essential.
Debating at Tech" is a new thing. 
The first real debating here was 
last year when the team met in a 
triangular debate with W. & .T.
and' West Virginia. At that time 
Mr. Peterson had to work with 
partially green material and a great 
amount of credit is due him for the 
team that he turned out within a 
matter of a few weeks. This team 
when they met W. & J. was greatly 
commended for the work.
The coach this year has a new 
system of developing a team and 
said that he wished all men inter­
ested in debating to come out.
A temporary committee was chosen 
including Mr. F. Bowers, M. Uslan, 
|Mr; Lawrence and Mr. Whitehead. 
•TT. Lefkourtz acted as secretary 
Mr. Bowers announced that there 
would be another meeting Wednes­
day, November 9, at 4:30 p. m., at 
Y. M. C. A. room. All interested in 
debating are welcome.
PRINCETON 
CONFERENCE
Nearly Forty Schools Re­
presented—Resolutions 
Adopted. Sec. Hughes 
Approves
HARDING ACCORDS
Nearly every important institution 
of higher learning in the East was 
represented. President Harding, in 
a telegram to John Grier Hibben, 
President of Princeton University, 
under whose auspices the conference 
is being held, said:
"My very cordial greetings to col­
lege conferees meeting at Princeton 
to discuss the problem incident to 
an international agreement on the 
limitation of armaments. Knowing 
as I do, the sincerity of our Amer­
ican ipurpose, free from every phase 
of national selfishness, it is most 
gratifying to know that the college 
thought of the Republic is being ex­
ercised helpfully to commit the sen­
timent of our country and the world 
to real achievement A great serv­
ice to this generation may prove 
vastly greater to the generations yet 
to come.”
Charles E. Hughes, Secretary of 
State, also expressed his approval 
of the object of the conference al­
though not in a message to Dr. Hib­
ben. "The State Department wel­
comes the aid of 'public spirited citi­
zens in furthering the objects of 
the Conference on the Limitation of 
Armaments, and keenly desires to 
facilitate all who are engaged in 
the effort to give accurate informa­
tion and to develop sound opinion,” 
said Mr. Hughes.
Both of these messages were read 
to Dr. Hibben in opening the con­
ference this afternoon. Dr. Hibben 
said that it was within the right of 
college men to undertake to sway 
public opinion in this matter and 
to' ask the members of the Interna­
tional Washington Conference to 
stand for a limitation of armaments. 
Disarmament Resolutions Adopted.
The conference adopted the follow­
ing resolution:
Whereas the recent World War 
has demonstrated that future war 
would be a calamity whose conse-

PENN STATE 
HOSPITALITY
Finest Treatment Possible 
Given Tech Student
"The art of the drama,” says the 
deft and obvious author of the “Thun­
derbolt," "Is a progressive art.” And 
the years since 1908 have brought in 
the art of depicting provincial peo­
ple a progress which throws these 
Mortimers and their wives (especial­
ly their wives), into the limbo of 
third or fourth rate portraits. Pinero 
has never been happy, anyhow, in his 
comic characterization; he Inevitably 
runs into caricature and farce, and 
caricature and farce of the most ob­
vious, without a touch of the Gilbert- 
ian genius. Whatever claims to high 
distinction as a wramatlst he may 
have lie elsewhere than in the realm 
of the creation of comic character. 
Yet there is a play in which a mov- 
ing human story is intimately bound 
up with a larger element of the 
comic than appears in any other of 
Pinero’s serious1 plays. It behooves 
the modern producer and the actor, 
therefore, to subdue as far as the 
dramatist's lines permit the inher­
ent farcicial tone. In the present pro­
duction this has hardly been done; 
rather, the farce has been allowed 
to run riot. Let it be admitted at 
once that this needed restraint is 
neither easy nor tempting to pro­
ducer or actor; for with the lines 
that Pinero has given him the re*- 
suit of much restraint would be col­
orlessness; except for an occasional 
flashing line .the dialogue is com­
monplace. But Mr. Schaughency, for 
example, in his quieter moments the 
most satisfying of the provincial 
group, could get his effects with a 
little less of boisterousness, a little 
less of extravagant gesture. Accept­
ing the farcical pitch of the provin­
cial group action as a whole, Mr. 
Caldwell interpreted the less dis- 
inctive' and less exacting part of 
Stephen with more restraint; Mr. 
Paquin did as well, perhaps, as was 
possible with a part which if not 
made farcical would be almost char- 
acteiies’sT Of the wives, Ann is col­
orless, Louisa ipure farce, and were 
so played, Rose, though character 
less, was well done.
.What is of value in the play is 
not about thrfse provincial types,, but 
about Thaddeus and his wife. And 
here Pjnero is on his own ground. 
In working up to and holding a sit­
uation of high emotional intensity 
no dramatist of our time has shown 
greater skill than he; No matter¦ 
how theatrical the foundations^, his 
"big scenes” as they unfold them­
selves hold the audience in com­
plete absorbtion. The big scene of 
The Thunderbolt is of course the 
third act. But there is a shorter 
emotional scene of high quality in 
the second act, and one less satis­
factory in the third—lesB satisfac­
tory because too obviously built up 
and because somewhat spoiled by 
the farcical elements. To all of 
these the principals do more than 
(Continued on Page Two.)
To describe the happenings at 
Penn State without a word about 
their hospitality would bo much the 
same as taking a 1 trip to Heaven 
without describing the wonders of 
said place. It seems that the 
one motto uppermost In the minus 
of those at the College is '‘Visitors 
first, State next!” If ever this was 
amply demonstrated! it was brought 
out on Saturday by their treatment 
of the Tartan invaders. The like ot 
it has never been seen on any trip 
in the last few years and will prob­
ably never be seen again till wo re­
turn to Stato.
To begin with they hoard that a 
crowd was. following, our team and 
the first thought that entored their 
minds was, they will be hungry 
when they arrive we got to feed 
them,. Accordingly the Y. M. C. A. 
got busy and with 1 the co-operation 
of Mr. Davis of Tech, sot 9, a meal 
for as many W9h eiv.;o... They didn't 
hire a bunch of waiters and got a 
lot of restaurant food and thon soak 
us good prico, but they gave us a 
real home cooked meal worth about 
throe times' the1 price and served it 
to us from the hands of tlio co-ods 
thomselves. They found out wo 
wanted moro after tlio game and so 
they gave up the afternoon at tlio 
field and preparod a second meal for 
the boys. If that’s not aelf-sacriilco 
and hospitality will some kind per­
son please describe tlio word.
Then camo the seats at the game., 
Right in the grand stands and al­
most opposite tlio State section. A 
moro Ideal place could not lmvo 
been asked for and ono could not 
holipl thinking of the seats ho had 
at a certain gamo three weeks ago. 
What a contrast!
I-Iospitality pormcaTod tlio atmos­
phere of the cheering section and 
a person on the field for the first 
time would have been in a quail dry 
to know whether the State section 
was cheering for Tech or the other 
team on tlio field. The Tech-Stato 
flag incident between halves Is 
something tlio likes of which will 
¡be .seen on mighty few college 
fields.
Even the game was full of good 
sportsmanship. The referee threat­
ened to put a protesting Tartan play­
er off the field for too vigorous pro' 
testation and like a flash Killingor 
was on hand virtually imploring 
that he be allowed to remain in the 
game. Again he asked that the ball 
be movedj to mid-field to give us 
chance but the decision could not 
ibe changed; State plays a remark- 
abily clean game at all times de­
spite the odds against them.
When the Tech team left the 
countiy club two State men were 
constantly with them to offer any 
assistance that might be called for. 
Arrangements were made for the 
handling of our teams’ baggage and 
although not used they were there 
if needed. After the , game the 
team was invited to a dinner at the 
field house and enjoyed a pleasant 
hour with the State players.
Another incident is worthy of 
mention. The Tech band left Pitts­
burgh without a cymibal player. On 
arriving at State it was found that 
they had only «two pairs of cymbals 
on hand but the better of these two 
was placed at the disposal of our 
band and the other was1 left for the 
State band.
Nothing was spared In giving the 
Tartau representatives the best lo 
be had. Men covering the game were 
cared for at the press box while 
those who sought other information 
concerning affairs , at Stato wore 
placed In the hands of those com­
petent to give thorn ¡every bit ¡of de­
tailed information required.
It \c probable that there wore doz­
ens of other incidents illustrative 
of our opponents’ hospitality, anion,% 
the fraternity houses, to the bum­
mers and those arriving in trucks, 
all too numerous toit mention here 
in detail.
In a nutshell, however, we are all 
of the opinion that nowhere ha'i 
Tech received tt g, treatment that 
was accorded to “? 0j at State. The

Suppose you are anxious to know

1 ever saw. Six a. m. the alarm 
clocks ot those few remaining on

Penn State had arrived. An hour

The Wednesday nssombllos In In­
dustries for tlio last two woolen havo 
boon unusual and vory Interesting. 
Two wooks ago tlio greator part of 
the assombly period was takon with 
an exhibition of motion plcturos, sont 
by the Lldgerwood Manufacturing 
company, of Now York, showing tholr 
systems of loading and unloading and 
moving coal, logs and sucli materials 
by moans of highly dovoloped cable­
way systems. Tho pictures wore vory 
clear and self-explanatory, and lllus- 
tvuted many extraordinary foats of 
onglnoerlng. A foature of tho exhibi­
tion was a demonstration of how tho 
cableway system could bo used to 
handle logs as tho trees wero cut 
down, lifting1, them out of hollotwsand 
taking them up and down stoop moun­
tains in places where it would bo Im­
possible to haul with teams or rail­
roads.
As is tho custom, tlio assembly this, 
last week was opened with c,hoering 
practice led by "Ducky” Alien. Dr. 
Marks then addressed the students, 
giving information about transporta­
tion and admission.to the State gamo. 
He strongly urged every student lo 
make the greatest effort to got to 
the game. Thirty per cent of the suc­
cess of the team depends on support 
by the students, he said.
The next speaker was Thomas, the 
cross country coach, who has done so 
much to put us on the track map tills 
year. He appealed to all Sophs and 
Plebes to get out for track and build 
up a squad for coming years. He has 
great hopes for Tech track possibil­
ities, but insists that success can only 
be assured by having a large squad of 
well developed and seasoned men.
Dr. Cartwright then gave an inter­
esting talk. He emphasized an ar­
ticle in the current issue of the 
American Magazine entitled "A Won­
derful Time for Young Men to be 
Alive,” by Bruce Barton. Along with 
his effervescence of amusing expres­
sions, Dr. Cartwright laid down some 
important rules which are doubtless 
of value to all of us. Quoting from 
Edward Everett Hale, he said: "Bo 
out of doors some part of every day.” 
He emphasized this as necessary to 
not only physical welfare, but also to 
the, welfare of our minds, as an asso­
ciation with nature is an essential to 
high ideals. Second he said, "Rub el­
bows with your fellow men.” ^uid 
thirdly/"Spend some time every day 
with someone who knows more than 
you do.” ifo Intimated that this would 
hardly bo acceptable to Freshmen,
Referring to Arlstotlo, he said that 
sorvico to our fellowmon la tho key 
to happiness. Aristotle's rules wore: 
Havo a goal for your mind, your mor­
als, and for your time, and strive to 
live up to It; obtain tho things necos- 
sary to achievo this goal; use what 
you havo to get what you want. Dr. 
Cartwright is an unusually forceful 
speaker and his talk was thoroughly 
appreciated.
After t he assembly a short meeting 
of the Tech Mechanics club was held 
and Herreran was elected president, 
with Rodge Marshall as treasurer.
Pennsylvania Day at Stato College, 
at which Carnogie Tech's football 
team was tho chief attraction, was 
originally in commemoration of tho 
founding of tho school, and in other 
years lias boon ono' of tlio big days 
of tho scholastic year at that place. 
Coming as it does during tho foot­
ball season, caro Is takon to pre-

tions of tho day wore of such im­

MR. INNESS SPEAKS
TO ART STUDENTS
Mr. George Iunoss, Jr., son of tho 
greatost landscape artist tho world 
has over known, delighted tlio stu­
dents of the P. &, I. Departmont of Arts 
last Thursday afternoon wlion he 
gave them an Informal talk In tho 
Life Studio. Mr. Taylor, who introduc­
ed him, said that I10 remembered Mr. 
Inness when his hair, which*is now 
short and gray, was long, black and 
curly. But even though) Mr. Inness 
be old in years, being over eighty, 
tlioro’a no denying that he’s young In 
spirit, for those who wore so for­
tunate as to hear him were “with 
him” from the beginning, even if he 
was, as he characterized himself, “not 
progressive, but just an old-fashioned 
artist with a hobby for painting tlio 
skies.”
He is not a graduate of any school, 
being a student of nature, a follower 
of tradition and a disbeliever in the 
many isms such as cuibes, futures 
etc. He brought a message filled not 
only with information, encouragement 
and gopd cheer, but also caused con­
siderable laughter with his inimitable 
characterizations, for he is a born 
actor as well as artist.
The object of art, Mr. Tnness said, 
is to make things more beautiful, so 
that the cleaner, happier and more 
beautiful we ourselves are, tho more 
beautiful will be our work. We must 
let the rays of sunlight into our 
hearts as well-as Into our studios If 
we are to grow better, and put our 
hearts and souls onto the canvas, He 
spoke dlspargingly of tho many ar­
tists who assume artistic attitudes, 
and try to breathe forth a Bohemian 
attitude. Thoro is 110 short road to 
art—thoro is no definite study to go 
through; it is tho ease of the artist 
who has tho most knowledge being 
the greatest artist, Don't hide any­
thing that you learn as you grow— 
give all your secrets to tho world for, 
by so doing you gain moro,
He closed by saying that his groat- 
evJt desire would be to Instinct a class 
of young artists, train them to be­
come able craftsmen and tell them 
what I10 thought be knew, for, being 
able to impart something to others, 
brings complete contentness.

It was a great game that Carnegio 
Tech played against Penn State; And 
it was an even greater game that 
Ponn State played against Carnogitf 
Tech. The score," 2S-7, does not by 
any means show how hotly contested 
tho game was. And again, the score 
just about as well as any other single 
item does show the true margin be­
tween the two teams. But, when ono 
gots down to rock-bottom facts, only 
tho fortunatos who saw the game can 
appreciate the true calibre of the two 
teams. It was a gamo, replete with 
thrills, in which of tho total number, 
perhaps Carnoglo Tech was respon­
sible for just as groat a number as 
was Penn Stato. It was a game in 
which good sportsmanship predomin­
ated; in which the word "die” never 
was glvon; in which many Btars scin­
tillated equally, and In which as per- 
foct football was displayed as It pos­
sibly could havo been.
From tho view point of the Mount 
Nlttany LI011 It was a game in which 
every available ounco of her energy, 
ability, stamina, and* skill had to bo 
brought, into tho playing of. Novor 
at 0110 single moment could Ponn 
Stato have lot up In her morclloaa 
driving and ramming of tho lighter 
Plaid lino. Bocauao If she had, tho 
ball would have gone ovor into tho 
hands of tho fast-running, and bril­
liant Tech backfiold, which might 
havo resulted disastrously, for it 
must bo admitted ovon by tho most 
enthusiastic "Stator" that tho Plaid 
machino was moving and plowing 
with groat apood and regularity whon- 
ovor they had tho ball. And tholr 
bag of trlclc plays wore working to 
porfoCtlon for long gains, as was ex­
emplified In many brilliant end runs, 
lino bucks, and ,forward pasaos. Stato 
won tho gamo*'bo<;auno she had ono

Talcing the viewpoint of Tool», tho

who did not see It), a bit disappoint­
ing. was In truth such as to fully

I lie "whalo of a gamo” as expected;
In that the outcome was just about 
as 11 should have boon, when team

In that Tech played, without a shadow

TECH'S NEEDS OUTLINED
IN YEAR'S REPORT
A gymnasium, stadium and colli- 
soum, library facilities, women's dor­
mitories and a chapel are declared 
to be the special needs of the Car­
negie Institute of Technology by 
President Arthur A. Iiamorsclilag in 
his report for the year ending Sep­
tember 30, which has just been made 
public. The report also deals with 
the accomplishments, finances and 
the report of tho survey commission 
appointed by the Carnegie corpora/- 
tion,
That the mu'ch-poeded gymnasium 
may he constructed duirng tho pres­
ent. school yoar and be ready for uso 
by the opening of tho next school 
year is tho hope expressed by Dr. 
Iiamorsclilag. The gymnasium is plac­
ed first in tho needs of tho Institu­
tion.
"Tho year 1021 always will bo 
memorable" says tho report, "since It 
transcends all others In bringing ten 
a culmination the long struggle for 
further participation in ».lie distribu­
tion of tho funds provided by our 
founder, Andrew Carnogie. for the 
Carnegie Corporation of Now York.”
Tho report calls attention to the 
survey commission’s findings which 
state that the institution may now be 
considered as having far transcended 
the primary intention of its founder; 
the institution is no longer local, but 
is national in its scope.

THE COLLEGE BUMMER
In glancing through our exchanges, we chanced upon an edito­
rial. in the Colgate Maroon, headed “The College JMmmcr.” Our 
views are in such accordance with those oil the Colgate editor that 
we quote him as follows:
“When the college Hall oi! Fame is dusted out and opened to the 
public, a large niche should be reserved for the man who follows his 
team in spite; of financial straits--the lowly bummer. Looked down 
upon by the profs whose classes he cuts, cussed by the motorists 
whose way in; blocks in quest of free transportation* overwhelmed 
by numbers in the enemy’s camp, he yet pursues his way undaunted. 
"Whether the game is in the next town or live hundred miles away, 
lie will blithely set out, though his pockets are empty. He may have 
to walk many miles, go without eating, and sleep in a hay loft; but, 
somehow, be gets there. Moreover, the team knows that he is there. 
It is he and othcrs-like him that give the Long Yell as the team bat­
tles on a field framed with the massed thousands oj: the foe. It is he 
that flings defiance in the face of the overwhelming numbers of the 
enemy, bringing to the team the spirit of Colgate that is backing 
them, making them realize that behind the little band of rooters is 
the whole student body back in Hamilton, breathlessly waiting for 
the returns, and backing them to a man.
“ We can’t help thinking that the bummer plays an important 
part in college life, though jic wander back late for his classes and 
call down professorial wrath, upon, his head. Whether he be called 
'Week-end Boanier or Athletic Crusader, we will have to take oil' our 
hats to his pluck and loyalty.”

M. M. ASSEMBLY
EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS
HELD IN DESIGN SCHOOL
Those who have seen the exhibi­
tion of Prof. H. Sternfeld's »ketches 
In the exhibition hall of the College 
of Fine Arts, have pronounced it to 
be the best exhibition ever held at 
school.
In hla SI sketches Mr. Sternfeld 
ha» used every possible medium in 
rendering and has used them to 
•perfection. Not enough can be »aid 
concerning tho merit of the work; 
but much can be accomplished by 
studying them.
Mr. 'Sternfeld made all these dur­
ing 1920-21, while »tudylng at Ecole 
des Beaux Art», Paris, a» a Paris 
prize man.
The Architectural Department is 
very fortunate in having »uch a 
man as the head of the department.
ARTS ASSEMBLY
Mr. Dan Cassidy's coming into the 
Margaret Morrison Assembly last 
Wednesday turned the tide of feel­
ing from an appreciation of the ridi­
culous to a realization of world af­
fairs as they stand at present. Ex­
plaining the conference at Princeton, 
where he represented Carnegie Tech 
among men from forty colleges in this 
portion of the United States, Mr. Cas­
sidy read tho resolutions there drawn 
up giving, in conclusion, an idea of 
the possible influence on the disarm­
ament conference of a definite stand 
of college students throughout the 
United States for disarmament.
This assembly, led by ‘the Seniors, 
was very successful. The entire 
Senior class, in all the dignity which 
the occasion required—hair severely 
restrained, masculine neckwear and 
horn-rimmed glasses —. still radiated 
the acme of nonsense, reaching its 
height in a most unusual solo by Miss 
S-chezan Nightingale. These; nalHem’blies 
in charge of the classes jot, Margaret 
Morrison, have started well.
The Arts Assembly last wek was 
favored by the presence of our ai ¦ 
assistant football coach, Bob Wadell. 
He told the assembly how the var­
sity football was the one thing of 
college life which was indelibly im­
pressed on the minds of graduates. 
It is the greatest thing outside <. 
an eduication at college—ih fact, the 
greatness of a college is invariably 
measured by it» football team. Tin 
Is Tech’s year in football and all 
that’s necessary to prove it to the 
world Is to have the student body 
back of the team. And the partic­
ular game is the one at Penn Stai 
to which every student is not. on 
invited but also urgently urged I 
attend.
Wadell’s talk stirred up a lot of 
dormant enthusiasm and was certain­
ly appreciated—for it started many 
more Stateward.
Dan Cassidy, who represented 
Tech at the Princeton conference on 
the Limitation of Arms, gave a brief 
report of his trip which is given 
in detail elsewhere in this issue.
There were several routine an­
nouncements, including, "as, usual.” 
that of a Wedmesday afternoon 
dance.
M. M. SOCIAL WORKERS' CLUB
Last year the student body seemed to think that they needed a 
song book, and they sot about getting one. A local contest was or 
ganized and numerous prizes were oil'ered. As yet the committee ih 
charge has made no report, nor have any prize awards been made, 
nor lias the student-body scon anything «1! tho songs that wore sub- 
inaMoclv A definite closing date was made last year and we know 
that sevmil songs were submitted becauso we have had letters from 
a, few of tho contestants, asking about tho, present status of'th'G con­
test.
Tho nmnbov ol! songs submitted, probably, did not come up to 
tho expectations ol! tho committee, but Ibis should not have stopped 
them from mnking tho awards. Several men wroto songs and per­
haps spent much ol! their time in doing it. it is only fair to these 
men that llm songs bo submitted to the student body and the prize 
awards bo made.
TO THOSE PENN STATERS
'When ono goes visiting, ovory little favor shown by the hosts is 
very marked. .But when one g'oos visiting on such, events as-last 
Saturday at I.Vnii State, not expecting anything out ol’ the ordi^nry, 
and finds such hospitality as was shown, by the .’Penn, State girls and 
fellows, every little favor is magnified many times and one feels at 
a loss'to express their gratitude.
Nothing but praise is heard from the athletie teams, the band 
ami the many parties, who were at; tho game, for the treatment no- 
eordod them and we assure I’enn State that they have iu every Car­
negie Tech man and WQinau, a. friend.
So, we, ol’ Carnegie Tech, every ono of us, in this manner, 
wish to express our heart-felt appreciation to those Penn Staters for 
their hospitality and many favors, hoping that we may soon liave the 
chance of entertaining them here.
MOVEMENT STARTED
TO IMPROVE PITT AND
TECH RELATIONS
A movement lias been started at 
last which bidf$ fair to bring Pitt 
and Tech into a closer relationship 
' non-athletlcally as well as athletic­
ally. The Xi Sigma Upsilon Fra­
ternity at Tech has invited all the 
fraternities' at Pitt and Tech to ap­
point representatives who will meet, 
together with some of the promi­
nent men of the two schools, such 
as coaches, managers, school officials 
and newspaiper men, to discuss the 
best ways and means by which the 
two schools can be brought into 
closer relationship.
The meeting is to be in the form 
of a sucker and will be held on 
November 9, at 8:30 p. m. It is 
said that nothing is ever acconv 
plished at a conference but this one 
will^ probably be the exception to 
tho rule as it; can outline a pro­
gram which, if given hearty support 
by the student bodies of the two 
schools, will son bring Pitt and 
Tech closer together.
The people ol! Pittsburg as well 
as tho student bodies of the two 
schools have long wished that they 
would resume diplomatic relations, 
especially nthlotlcnlly, but no ono 
took the Initiative,
XI Sigma llpsllon felt, the nood 
along with tho rest of us and they 
deserve the credit for attempting to 
get; things started,

justice. Throughout the play, in­
deed, Mr. Willard has given us a 
notable, bit of acting, notable alike 
in restraint and expressiveness. This 
young actor holds no small part of 
his future in his hands; more than 
one professional might watch with 
advantage those hands as they sug­
gest the emotion of tho moment. 
Miss Ziele, though less •distinguished,
little lacking in variety of tone 
and gesture. In the conventional 
part of Helen Miss Osborne played 
acceptably; she was in no way re­
sponsible for the failure of tho 
dramatist: to justify the rapid
changes in tho emotional attitude 
of the character.
The minor parts were on the 
whole adequately carried. Mr. Roid 
and Mr. Iioag suggested well the 
stiffness and punctilious courtesy of 
the typical English solicitor. The 
children were stage children, not be­
cause Miss Ripley and Mr. Mudgett 
played them as stage children, but 
because Pinero made them stage 
children, and they could not be play­
ed otherwise.
The regular monthly meeting of the 
Margaret Morrison Social Workers' 
club was held Wednesday evening. 
Supper, a typically Hallowe’en one, 
was Bervod to about, forty members 
and guests. A short business meet­
ing followed the supper and the re­
mainder of the meeting was given 
over to u discussion of disarmament.
Helen McKee gave .'i report on Will 
Irvin’s book "The Next War” and 
clearly illustrated the absolute need 
of disarmament. Laura Buglier told 
of the plans for the International Con­
ference and the conditions in the for­
eign countries which wlll^bo repre­
sented at the conference. ICnoAving 
those conditions ono can have an Idea 
of tho problems which will bo, discuss­
ed in tliV) conference. Susan Shedd 
and Adelaide Kriclc informed us of 
"Who in Who" at the conferonce. 
They had gathered some very Inter­
esting material on the history and 
character of somo of the representa­
tives.
Members of other student organiza­
tions of Margaret Morrison woro pres­
ent, and all joined in tho open forum 
discussions each sharing her Informa­
tion on tho subject with the others 
assembled. Tho student conforonco 
held at, Pitt last Saturday night was 
reported on. Tho Student. Friendship 
fund came In for discussion as well 
as tho Importance of tho conforonco 
being hold with tho doors open wldo 
to the public.
The question uppermost was what 
can wo, here at Tech, do to spread 
disarmament; propaganda and make 
our follow students hero and abroad 
know tho value of tlvolr opinion on the 
matter and tho importance of express­
ing it by messages to tho conference? 
It was felt that no uniform action was 
being taken hero in our college. The 
unanimous decision was that tlio Stu­
dent Council bo petitioned to appoint 
a four school committee to get the 
subject forcibly before the students 
and to keep in touch and co-operate 
with others interested in this ex­
tremely important subject.

A. I. E. E. MEETING
"Electrification of Railroads” was 
the topic of discussion of the talk by 
N. W. Storer, vice president of the 
A. I. E. E. in the Pittsburgh district 
and railway engineer of the Westing- 
house Electric and Manufacturing 
Company, at the monthly meeting of 
the Carnegie Tech branch of the A. 
I. E. E. last Thursday.
Room 11, was crowded to capacity 
by electrical department students who 
gathered to hear the address by Mr. 
Storer and the discussion which fol­
lowed.
Judging from present indications 
the students realize the advantages 
of joining the A. I. E. E.‘ and the 
membership is rapidly nearing the 
100’ per cent mark. Several have 
also taken out student memberships 
in the national organization.

ARTS GIRLS JUNIOR PROM
The Tau Gamma Phi Hallowe’en 
dauce was held at the - chapter 
house on Friday evening, October 
28. The decorations were in keeping 
with the spirit of Hallowe’en. Coru- 
stalUs and pumpkins adorned the 
corners, of tho rooms while the 
Walls were decorated with figures of 
witches, ghosts and cats. Tho light­
ing was strikingly otTootlve, giving 
tho rooms a dusky,, moonlit appear­
ance. In order to accommodate tho 
largo orowd<, the porch was enclosed 
and many couples found this a de­
lightful place to dance bocauso of 
its coolness.
The programs were oil unique de­
sign to conform with tho l’ostlvo oc­
casion. About thirty couples at­
tended and all expressed, their enjoy­
ment of the music which wos fur­
nished by tho “All Tecli1 Novelty

were Mrs. Scales, Mr. and Mrs. 
Mitclmer and several alumni.
SECRETARIAL CLUB
Thursday, November 2, from 4:30 tcj

ing the program of the club for the 
current year. The president Miss 
Helen Hester, gave, a brief resume of 
the activities of the Disarmament

MUSIC DEPARTMENT
"PEP” PARTY
On Friday night, November the 
fourth, the music department of the 
College of Fine Arts gave its first 
party of the season in the orchestra 
rehearsal room. The party was in 
the nature of a Hallowe’en dance, au­
tumn leaves, balloons and serpentine 
confetti forming the decorations. The 
department was well represented and 
about seventy-five people joined in 
tho fun. Faculty mourners were the 
guests of the students.
Considering the spirit shown, the 
splendid turnout;, and the gayety of 
the occasion, tho party was by far 
tins’ biggest and host the department 
thus over had, and it augurs well for 
tho year’s social events.

rollment of over seventeen hundred 
men. This figure does not include 
the officers who are drawn mainly 
from the two upper classes of the 
school.
For many students, however, the 
most enjoyable part of the Pennsyl­
vania Day program is the annual ar­
ray of the house «parties, held by 
the various fraternities. House par­
ties are events unknown in the so­
cial calendar at Tech, and are the 
question of hot debate .in the offi­
cial minds at other institutions. 
These formal dances, held Friday 
evening before Penn Day, after 
which the fraternity houses are 
given over to the guests for the 
night, while the , men seek other 
lodgings in the town, are among the 
biggest social events of the year at 
this school, and are looked forward 
to from the ^ginning of the year.

parties, the Penn State Club, com­

Rochester High defeated the Tech 
Reserves in a hard fought battle at 
Rochester, Pa., Saturday. The ball 
remained in midfield during most 
of the game. Ganoe lefi end for the 
High School lads, intercepted’ two 
of Tech’s forward passes and made 
a touchdown both times. Lord, the 
Reserve’s quarterback, got the only 
touchdown for his team. The game 
ended with the ball near the mid- 
field, neither team scoring in the 
last quarter. The teams were pret­
ty evenly matched. The Reserves 
excelled in line work and punting 
while Rochester showed up better 
in end runs.
Both teams tried many forward 
passes but only a few were com­
pleted and then for only small gain.
The game, was played before a 
crowd of about 2,000 townspeople.

PENN AND FRANKSTOWN
Bethany comes to Tech field this 
week with a most impressive record, 
and should furnish the football pub­
lic with one of the best games of tlio 
present season, without a doubt, it 
WILL be the best game of the sea­
son on Tech field. Bethany is at the 
present time making the same fight 
that Carnegie Tech is for recogni­
tion in select company of the football 
world, and like Tech again, she 
seems right on the verge of gaining 
that objective. A defeat at this time 
of the season would greatly jeopard­
ize the gaining of that desire, and 
the same might be said in regard to 
Carnegie Tech. For that reason, the 
two teams, when they lineup for the 
game this Friday, Armistice Day, will 
each be primed for the battle, both 
realizing that they are up against a 
type of team that might put a "crimp” 
into their aspirations. .
To date there seems from a com­
parison of the season’s record, that 
neither Tech nor Bethany can claim 
the more impressive record, both 
being good. Neither team has made a 
single poor showing and both have 
made most creditable showings in al­
most all games played. Washington 
& Jefferson is the only team upon 
which a comparison can be made, and 
both teams having lost by the same 
score, would indicate that the two 
teams are of equal strength. A most 
impressive part of Bethany’s.schedule 
was her game with the Navy, in which 
the Navy was held to a 21-0 score, 
and from reports, the score should 
have been much lower. It was simply 
a case of stage-fright at the very 
kick-off that caused the first touch­
down, after which Bethany settled 
down and played on practically equal 
terms with the Naval Academy, much 
to her credit, for the Navy is seriously 
considered by many critics as the 
prospective Eastern champion.
Aside from these two above named 
games Bethany has defeated Marietta 
28-7, Ohio University 13-0, Univorsity 
of Buffalo 42-0, and Dayton 78-0.
Against the above games, Tech has 
of course her great showing against 
Penn State, coupled with her 7-0 v.ic^ 
tory over Geneva, her 42-0 victory 
over Westminster, her 42-0 victory 
over St. Bonaventure and her 5G-0 
victory over Allegheny.
So, it cah readily be seen by tho 
most casual observer that the teams 
are very well and equally balanced, 
and should the outcome run true to 
the dope, should furnish a football 
battle that would satisfy the most ex­
acting football supporter.
And there is another item that will 
do more than Its part in making this 
the best football gamo of tho present
On The Plaid Screen
BY H. L. MOERSFELDER
A CORNELL-TECH MEET
Again last Saturday Tech upheld her rccord of fast runs in defeating 
Penn State in a cross-country meet at State College. Beside her decisive 
win over Lafayette, Tech has defeated the strong Lehigh team and is in a 
position to challenge the best team In the east for cross-country champion­
ship.
Cornell appears to be the nearest competitor Carnegie Tech has, and the 
cross-country classic of the season would be a hill and dale run over the 
Schenley Park course between the Red and White and Tech.
season on Tech field. Last year tho 
Plaid machine made a trip to Wheel­
ing. and with their over-confidence 
sticking out on all sides, were knock­
ed into a dozen spasms of defeat. 
This year, fully realizing the import­
ance of the game, and having learned 
their lessons well, over-confidence 
¦will be absent, and that good old Tech 
fight and determination will be in­
stalled in its place, which bodes ill 
for somebody.
Tech came out 'of the Pehn State 
game with no injuries that will prove 
disastrous. Of course there were the 
usual number of bruises ancL, slight 
cuts, all of which will respond to the 
most efficient treatment of Bert Mun- 
liall. Brumbaugh came out with a 
twisted ankle. Godden is limping 
slightly and Sprinkle had the hard 
luck to lose a perfectly good tooth.
Bethany will bring up here a sea­
soned team, including fullback Ran­
dolph and halfback Jean, both close 
to 200 pounds, who are considered 
mighty good ground-gainers. Jean is, 
aside from a good line plunger, a good
WATCHING THE STATE
GAME AT THE UNION
"Tech 7, Penn State 0, emLof tho 
first quarter,” announced the tele­
phone operator in the Union lust 
Saturday to the bunch gathered 
¿here for the returns of the gamo. 
Immediately tho place went wild.
“Is that a fact?”
"Ray Tech!”
“We may beat them yet.”
The excitement was great and 
the score was joyfully announced to 
all newcomers and anyone standing 
in the street. After twenty min­
utes or so of suspense and a Cp>\ 
false alarms tho second report came 
in.
"End of first half, Tech 7, Penn 
State 7.” Not so good; yet every­
one hoped that Tech would make 
the next touchdown.
' "Tech 7, Penn State 21, end third 
quarter.” Aitd then the gloom start­
ed; although everyone was behind
Tech until the final whistle.- As no

necessary, will no doubt be called 
upon to perform in this manner. They 
are also especially proficient in tho 
forward passing game, making both 
long and short passes of a type that 
are hard to down with any degree of 
consistency.
Tech is considering this one of the
tho Union, tho students left, sorry 
Teoh was losing, but confident that 
the game would bo a victory for 
Ti-ch.
The reports were received by 
wiroless in the tower on Machinery 
Hall and telephoned over to tho 
Union. Play by play reportó of tho
hardest games of the season, and for Nebraska-Pltt gamo were also given, 
that reason Coach Steifen will install j S j
secret practice again, taking no 
•chances of having his ip;lays and sig­
nals uncovered. The dally grind will 
continue late oach evening.
STATE WINS GREAT GAME
(Continued From Pago One) 
until the State line had the Tech line 
prone on the ground, leaped forward 
and over for largo gains; and her end 
runs while usually not gaining at all, 
did manage to make some substantial 
gains. But by far tho largest gains, 
and most conslstotil;, wore made 
straight through the line. In tins, 
tho backs were materially aided by 
the wonderful worlc of tlio Ponn State 
line, for this lino has fow equals In 
the country, as testified by tho fact 
that it paved the way for gains 
through the Harvard and Georgia 
Tech lines, and hold tho much-vaunt­
ed Georgia Tech offonse to a practical 
stand still.
State's Big Three.
In tho .execution of those plays, 
Penn State has a triumvlrato .of dis­
tinct stars In tho porsonages of Kll- 
linger, quarterback; Llghtnor, right 
halfback, and Wilson at left halfback. 
There? Is 110 lack, of truth In saying 
that Killinger. IS and should bo, If 
not, All-American. Ho Is what 1« 
known, as a triple-threat man, being 
equally proficient at ond runs, lino 
bucks, punting, drop kicking and 
throwing of tho forward pass. Llght- 
ner’s line bucking was a delight to 
behold. Wilson was just as good, If 
not belter, for his gains were usually 
larger than those of Llghtner’s. With­
out these three, tho gamo might have 
been very close in regard to the 
score. Every ono of Penn State’s 
four touchdowns camo as a direct re­
sult of the wonderful and regular line 
plunging, and endi runs of these three 
men, they usually carrying the hall 
in rotation, and always for neat gains 
around five to twenty-five yards, the 
greater number being around five 
yards. State was especially lacking 
in the brilliant long runs.
Tech Scores On Triple Pass.
From the Tech side of the ledger, 
Tech’s game was offensively one of 
great brilliance and daring. Robert­
son again was the outstanding star, 
with “Red” Godden a close second, 
and Brumbaugh next—Robertson, be­
cause of his brilliant run, after the 
triple pass, to the lone Tech touch­
down; Godden, because of his stellar 
end playing and his participation as 
the middle man in the triple pass; 
Brumbaugh, because of his 45-yard 
gain through the line, only being 
downed on the Penn State 10-yard 
line. Mills did great work when 
slipved in to take Brumbaugh's place 
when he snagged a forward pass 
from Sawyer, making a gain of. twen­
ty yards. As usual the whole line 
from end to end, inclusive, performed 
in great style under the constant 
hammering and driving tactics of 
Penn State. Their great fight, pluck 
and determination did a lot in keep­
ing down the score, and in holding the 
powerful State line.
By far the most brilliant part of 
the game was executed by Tech right 
at the very start, when after three 
minutes of play, Sawyer dropped back 
to make a forward pass, with Rob­
ertson a least bit In front of him. 
Sawyer received the pass from Irwin, 
threw It to Godden, who ran across 
the field about ton yards, and just as 
he was about to be tackled, passed
ever seen during his whole careor as 
a player and roforoo.

Beats State 24-31 Over New Course—Kelley Finishes First

ALLEGHENY AND W. VIRGINIA HERE FRIDAY
Y. M. C. A. SWIM WEDNESDAY
Ponn State failed to account for all the victories at their Penn­
sylvania Day celebration last Saturday for the Plaid cross-country 
team stepped oil; to a 31-24 victory over the State harriers. It was 
the first intercollegiate meet run over the new course at State Col­
lege. The course is rather devoid of hills which hampered the Tech 
runners who are accustomed to a more hilly course, if the moot had 
been conducted on the home course, no doubt State would have been
whitewashed. The weather condi­
tions for tho meet wore adverse, tl 
was very cold, with snow Hurries 
and a strong wind blowing which 
slowed up the runuors.
J. L. Ronig, former Penn Stato 
star ancl Olympic man, acted as 
one of tho officials of the meet. Duo 
to some misunderstanding, the timo 
of the runners was not taken. Tho 
men paced as follows: First, Kel­
ley, Tech; second, Dykeman, Tech; 
third, Miller, Tech; fourth, Snyder, 
State; fifth, (Cooper, State; sixth, 
Shields, State; seventh, Enck, State; 
eighth, Greenlaw, Tech; ninth, 
Windier, State; tenth, Tubbs, Tech; 
eleventh, Kissinger, State; twelfth, 
Cavott, Tech; thirteenth, Hamilton, 
Stato; fourteenth,. Mendenhall, Tech.
This makes the third victory for 
Tech, having previously defeated Le­
high and Lafayettt). On Friday,

all tho boys who had come up in 
trucks and on foot and they too 
said that they had1 been treated roy­
ally when they arrived. Not satis­
fied they made arrangements to «feed 
us after the game and tell you we 
were mighty glad for it later.
Well it was time to get to the 
field and it was no time before every 
seat . in the stands was filled I 
ain’t kidding you a bit State was 
scared. After the Tech band had 
marched around the field and shown 
them that one any college could be 
proud of the State band came out. 
They made quite an impressive 
sight, one hundred and twenty 
strong and afl in army uniforms, 
followed by nine sub-cheer leaders 
and two head cheer leaders. De­
spite the fact that they outnumbered 
our band I still contend that ' our 
band was the better of the two. 
After this State let loose with a 
cheer and now I know what they 
mean by the roar of the Nlttany 
Lion. But it wasn’t a roar of bos 
tillty ’cause they cheered just as 
hard and Just as often for Tech as 
thoy did for State;
Tho two loams camo on tho field 
and received Iho usually noisy wol

the arms of Robertson, running par-¡time thero wore at loast (100 motor.-1
allei to him, who with a clear Hold, | on hand and each ono using all
raced 50 yards for the first touch­
down. This was a most brilliant play, 
and completely caught the Penn State 
team by surprise, and evoked a large 
bit of applause from the Penn State 
stands, true sportsmen as they are. 
The play was timed and executed 
with perfection, av ' as Dan Daugh­
erty, the referee. ’ fked after the 
game, was the play he had
three of his lungs. Tho game start­
ed and you should havo seen that 
team of ours play. If Georgia Tech, 
with their orange sweaters is a 
Golden Tornado, then we with our 
grey sweaters must be a Platinun 
Tornado.
Every State man interviewed 
agreed, that Georgia was a cine’ 
Iongslde the steam roller and they
Pittsburgh and I know that man 
had collected no cash fares. Ain't 
they just the baddest boys you ever 
heard of. I wouldn't do that for 
the wolld.
Back in town at 2 p. m. every one 
agreed that it was the .best trip, that 
had) ever “-been taken away from 
home, it sure was close to a day 
of judgment for State and but for 
that man Killinger the Immqrval 
Gods would have been -with us. But 
just you wait ’till next year, give 
us the chance and wo turn the old 
Sam.4on trick on all the lions that

THE ODYSSEY OF A BUMMER
(Continued From Page One.) 
on tho way back with a supper 
thrown in for good measure, can 
probably crow the loudest. With 
utter disdain they looked dowr. on 
the ilivver that pulled in at eleven 
o’clock tonight after a delirious 
ride uninterrupted except for a 
stoip every ten: miles to let the en­
gine cool down and jlrain the water 
out of the cylinders, not to mention 
a garage every twenty-live miles for 
oil or gas or something else, such 
as a new gasket.
What we were wondering is what 
happened to tho trucks that went 
uip. The special coming back was 
loaded with rough-loking individuals 
who seemed uneasy of mind and res­
tive of feet whenever that conductor 
hove in sight. On closer question­
ing it developed that many of these 
individuals had come up in the 
pneumatic tired trucks, but now 
were mostly' tired, with no more 
peumatic about it. Lots of the 
bummers 'were passed by the ileet 
at the start of the journey and later 
passed the same trucks again, rid­
ing in the royal estate of an Old«- 
mobile or an Essex or a Nash. As 
a trmckster remarked, in the hills 
the maximum speed of the pneu­
matics was two miles an hour. The 
ambitions ones walked ahead of the 
machine to keep warm and then 
nearly froze to death waiting for 
the truck tp catch uip with them 
at the top of the hills. But this 
bird was a nature lover, for he fur­
ther rises to remark that “then 
came the beautiful sunrise in the 
mountains, and all was well again.” 
Later on he told us that the left 
hind/ tire blew out just at day­
break.
It seems that Altoona saw quite 
a little of this latter day crusade, 
for one traffic ¡cop is quoted as say­
ing: “Say, where in the dickens
(?) are all of you fellows from? I 
spent all day yesterday sending you 
'birds through.” Which again goes 
to show the deplorable lack of prop­
er ediucation of our public officials 
in this great and enlightened state. 
It’s a cinch that tills particular offi­
cer never slept a beat in Pittsburgh.
When it came right down to the 
time spent on the road by the bum­
mers and tho truckers, the latter, 
soom to have received the worst of 
it. Quite a fow of the former 
»pecies made ilio one way trip in 
from nine to iifteen hours, while
0110 truck was on tho road for twen­
ty-two hours on the way up. The 
longest lime officially recorded 
against/ a bummer was twenty-iive 
hours, and this was chalked Hip 
against the Corduroy Twins.
You know, ovoryone of tho fol­
lows who camo in to gas, after ar­
riving back homo (here talked of
tlio lino treatment accorded them 
by tho Ponn Stato fellows. No ono 
seems to liavo any kick coming at 
all, and ovory ono was taken care 
of for tho night If they happened 
to got there Friday evening, as 
some of the more fortunate ones did. 
“Why tlioso fellows oven shared 
their blankets with us, so we 
would not freeze on the sofas and 
lounges in their houses’' cne of the 
men told us, and added that they
wore also well fed before being put
to „bed by their hosts.
“And say,” one of these 'birds re­
marked, still in his breeches and 
puttees, “if any one did any Work 
for Monday, we’re going to jump 
on his frame.” Which reminds us 
that its now darn near one o’clock, 
and that some profs have no sense 
of the fitness of things, even after 
a football game such as was. And 
if tjie boss doesn’t quit telling us 
at 11:30 p. m. to write a story, 
when we want to begin our even­
ing’s study, why lie’ll have to take 
all the blame for our deficiencies.

quences are beyond all calculation; 
and
Whereas the nations of the world, 
already impoverished by past wars 
and confronted 'by the urgent social 
and economics problems bred by 
war, 'have entered on an unprece­
dented scale into the race for mili­
tary and naval supremacy, which 
makes for mutual distrust and war, 
rather than for mutual understand­
ing ami] peace; and
Whereas the costs of vast arma­
ments prevent the diverting into 
constructive channels of money and 
energy, sorely needed for the so'u- 
tion of the problems of peace; ana
Whereas the Government of the 
United Statos, appreciating these 
facts, has invited the powers to 
meet in conference at Washington 
to discover moans through which 
tho reduction aiy* limitation of arm­
aments by international agreement 
may be realized and to promote 
through amicable discussion uni­
versal good-will; and
Whereas, the college men who 
s/peak have proved their devotion 
and loyalty in the past war and 
the generation which the present 
would in all probability bear the 
bli,jnt of a future war; therefore, 
be it
Resolved, That we, the represen­
tatives of forty colleges and univer­
sities in conference assembled, do 
hereby express to the Government 
of the United States our unquali­
fied approval of the course it has 
taken in summoning the Washing­
ton conference and our entire sym­
pathy with the purposes of the con­
ference, pledging our faithful sup­
port to Oie United States delegates 
in their efforts to alleviate the bur­
den of war and preparation for war, 
through mutual understanding 
through world reduction and limita­
tion or armaments; and that we do 
hereby ujrge upon all delegates that 
their efforts shall not cease until 
some solution be found whereby the 
•possibility of war may be minimized, 
and whereby at least a considerable 
portion of the vast amount of ener­
gy and money expended by the na­
tions for armament may be released 
for the development rather than the 
destruction of civilization and the 
human race.
And be.it further resolved:
That it is the sense of the Inter­
collegiate Conference that the 
Washington conference will not 
have attained its objective without:
(1) A settlement of tho Far East­
ern question based upon principles 
which will make practicable., the re­
duction of naval, armaments.
(2) An agreemont to suspend all 
present, programs for naval con­
struction and to undertake- no fur­
ther •••expansion.
(3) An agreement to reduce sub­
stantially tho ipresent naval strength 
of the nations concerned. And be 
it further
Resolved: That a copy oi the
above resolution be signed by each 
delegate here assembled,. and dis­
patched forthwith- to the President 
of the United States of America, andI
 to representatives of the press for

(Continued From Page One.) 
code of hospitality is one all their 
own and one which covers evei*y 
one. It can be safely said that there 
was not a person on the trip who 
will not start saving his money now 
for a repeat next year if the oppor­
tunity occurs and all are glad that 
Tech’3 victorious defeat came at the 
hands ol Penn State.
BECAUSE wc put the utmost quality into 
this one brand. Camels are as good as it’s 
possible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge 
of fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.
Nothing is too good for Camels. And bear 
this in mind! Everything is done to make 
Camels the best cigarette it’s possible to buy. 
Nothing is done simply for show.
Take the Camel package for instance. It’s the 
most perfect packing science can devise to pro­
tect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy 
paper—secure foil wrapping—revenue stamp 
to seal the fold and make the package air-tight. 
But there’s nothing flashy about it. You’ll find 
no extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.
Such things do not improve the smoke any 
more than premiums or coupons. And remember 
—you must pay their extra cost or get lowered 
quality.
If you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest 
cigarette you can imagine—and one entirely free 
from cigaretty aftertaste,
It’s Camels for you.
