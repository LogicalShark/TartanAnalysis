TAKEN FROM BOOK
Many of Scenes of Drama 
Are Set Near Tech 
Campus
As the last production of the 
school year, the Drama Depart­
ment will present in the Little 
Theater "Answer Before Dark,” by 
Mrs. E. M. Vermorckcn. The play, 
under the direction of Professor 
E. W. Hickman, will be produced 
for one week in the Little Theater, 
beginning May 19.
Produced By Hickman
“Answer Before Dark,” as it is 
being produced by Professor Hick­
man, is the dramatization of Mrs. 
Vermorclccn’s book by the same 
name. A number of the author’s 
friends realized that the book had 
dramatic possibilities, and last sum­
mer they persuaded her to rewrite 
it for the stage. The story, which 
first appeared a year ago this 
spring, revolves around a girl of 
considerable talent, who wishes to 
become an artist. Many of the 
scenes arc set in and around Pitts­
burgh. One in particular is only 
a few yards from the Carnegie 
campus in the parlor of the Golf 
Club in Schcnley Park. Another 
thing which- gives the play an at­
mosphere entirely of Pittsburgh is 
the International Exhibition of 
Paintings at the Carnegie Museum, 
where one of the pictures of the 
girl artist is received as being 
among the best.
By Mrs. Vermorckcn 
Mrs. Vermorckcn, who writes 
uhder the nom de plume of Eliza­
beth Moorhead, was until three 
years ago directly connected with 
Carnegie for 17 years as associate 
professor of English Literature. 
Since her resignation, she has tak­
en up writing as a profession, a 
field in which she has always been 
keenly interested. "Answer Before 
Dark” is her second novel. Iler 
first is called “Clouded Hills” and 
in an interview last week she said 
that a third was now under way 
The students of the department 
who arc being cast in the principal 
parts of the play arc Elizabeth 
Drake, Helen Sisenwain, Annabelle 
Kempton, Leo Daschbach, Clancy 
Cooper, Donn Bonhoff and Roge: 
Gill.
At present, the Drama Depart­
ment is presenting Shakespeare's 
“Macbeth.” The last performance

MEN COMPLETE PLANS 
FOR DORMITORY BOAT 
RIDE, FRIDAY, MAY 15
Art Giles’ Orchestra to 
Play Abroad “Julia 
Belle Swain”
Plans have been completed for 
the Men’s Dormitory Boat Dance 
to be held aboard the excursion 
steamer Julia Belle on Friday eve­
ning, May 15. This is the last big 
social function of the year and is 
distinctly different from any affair 
held during the school year. For 
this reason the committee in charge 
has decided that the ticket sale 
shall be open to the entire school, 
and the price of tickets has been 
reduced to $1.25. In order /to in­
sure that the dance floor will not 
be browded, however, the ticket 
sale will be restricted to 200 cou­
ples. Anybody contemplating at­
tending the dance should therefore 
obtain their tickets as early as pos­
sible, as there will be no extra 
tickets sold.
The dance will he appropriately 
carried out in a nautical style, and 
the favors, which are being made 
up by special order, have in them 
the real tang of the sea. A/t Giles 
music has been secured for the 
dance, and this popular broadcast­
ing orchestra will furnish music 
from 8 o’clock until the boat docks 
at 1 a. m.
Tickets will be on sale at the 
Y. M. C. A. office, at the Grill and 
from the following committee mem­
bers: George Nosky, chairman,
Engclbrccht hall; Leslie Parmclce, 
Boss hall; Leon Segal, Miller hall, 
O. C. Burger, Welch hall; Fred 
Morris, Scobcll hall; Fred Lang, 
McGill hall, and Sidney Krasik, 
Henderson ( hall. Dormitory men 
will be given first choice in a spe­
cial early ticket sale for their bene­
fit. For this reason all dormitory 
men contemplating going on the 
boat ride should obtain tickets 
from their committee members as 
early as possible or reserve a ticket 
to be held for them.
The preliminaries of the inter- 
fraternity sweepstakes will take place 
on Friday morning of Campus Week 
at 10:30, at which time the entries 
will be divided into three heats. The 
winner and second place of each heat 
will compote in the final competition 
the following morning at 10:30. 
Drawings for positions in the heats 
will take place Thursday morning at 
11:30 in the Trophy Room of the 
Gym. and any team not represented 
at the drawings will not be allowed' 
to compete in any of the contests. 
Entrants will. be disqualified if they 
arc not ready to start within fifteen 
minutes of the appointed time.
The course taken by the racers, 
which is divided into five sections, 
starts in front of Margaret- Morri­
son on Tech street, goes up Tech 
street to Park boulevard, where it 
turns to the right and passes through 
Schenley Park to Woodlawn. It 
then passes up Woodlawn to Frew 
street and finishes at the junction 
of Frew and Tech streets.
Each entering team shall consist 
of one driver and five pushers, and 
the same team qualifying in the 
heats must compeie in the finals. 
All members of teams must be active 
members or pledges of the organiza­
tion which they represent.
Only one pusher may push in one 
section of the course, and change 
of pushers between each section 
must be made after the car has en­
tered and before it has left the chang­
ing zone. The driver must accom­
pany the car over the entire course.
The sweepstakes cars, which »are to 
be pushmobilcs not weighing less than 
sixty pounds, must be presented for 
weighing Friday at 9:45 in front of 
Margaret Morrison. [
Aside from the speed trophy to be 
awarded to the fastest pushmobiie 
team, another trophy will be given to 
the organization having the car 'of 
the best design. The award will be 
based on mechanical features' and 
symetry of lines. Judgment will take 
place immediately following the pre­
liminary heats at the Woodlawn en­
trance of Arts School.
The Thistles will be out on sale 
in the “Y” officc, Monday, May 11. 
Students should bring their order 
stubs and the balance of the money 
due in order to receive their copy; 
no books will be given out without 
the stub or money.
The Thistle staff, expressing a 
desire to keep the contents of the 
Thistle a secret until the books 
were out,-gave only a few hints 
as to what the book will contain. 
They state that a complete, and 
beautiful color section of the build­
ings at Carnegie will be one of the 
most outstanding features of this 
year’s book. A cover so unique 
and outstanding that it will far 
surpass any previous covcr for the 
Thistle will be another feature of 
the volume.
The students arc reminded that 
they have only two more days in 
which to place their order. If they 
have not been able to find a sales­
man, they should place their order 
in the “Y” office. All sales must 
be in before May 7.
The salesmen, freshmen and 
sophomores, should bring their or­
der books and money, in person, 
to Raymond Knopf at the Theta 
Xi house before May 7. As the 
business positions on the Thistle 
staff, will be alloted according to 
the amount of sales, the salesmen 
are urged to visit all their pros­
pects and bring to a close all sales 
before they turn their order books

COAL RESEARCH BOARD 
ADOPTS CARNEGIE PLAN
At a meeting of the National 
Coal Association held at Purdu 
University on April 20, the Tech­
nical Research Section endorsed the 
Advisory Board plan of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.
It was stated that the Research 
Section was in favor of the forma­
tion of advisory boards of oper­
ators to co-roperate > and promote 
coal research of every character 
with the universities located in their 
respective communities or states. 
A plan on the order of- that by 
which the Advisory Board of Car­
negie Institute of Technology func­
tions will be submitted by the 
Section to all district operators’ as­
sociations with the recommenda­
tions that it would be advisable to 
organize somewhat similar commit­
tees or boards in their respective 
districts.
At the meeting the Section also 
was in favor of the employment by 
the National Coal Association of 
a technically trained man, who 
should translate currcnt research 
data of practical value into lay­
man’s language. This data would 
be distributed throughout the in­
dustry, and- would aid the advance­
ment and correlation of the pro­
grams of the proposed advisory 
boards.
The Section was also in favor of 
developing information regarding 
the advisability of promoting short 
courses in combustion engineering j 
under the auspices of universities. I
With the approach of the annual 
Call Da}r, which takes place Friday 
afternoon, May 8, this year, the 
Dragons, Delta Skulls, and Druids 
arc busy selecting members for their 
respective organizations for the school 
year 1931-1932. On last Wednesday 
the Druids entertained prospective 
members at a smoker. Their activities 
were explained and other questions 
were cleared up by Joe Bronson, 
president, and various members. Dcari 
Keeble presented a short talk in 
which he stressed the importance of 
Druid membership, and asked for 
the co-operation of those who would 
not be so fortunate as to become 
Druids. The Dragons and. Delta 
Skulls have picked their men through 
personal acquaintance, and through 
a knowledge of their activities. Other 
honoraries who will probably make 
their calls include Alpha Tau, indus­
tries honorary; Tau Beta Pi, engine­
ering honorary; Tau Sigma Delta, 
architectural honorary; Theta Tau, 
professional engineering fraternity; 
Eta Kappa 'Nu, electrical honorary; 
Pi Delta Epsilon, journalistic hon­
orary; Pi Tau Sigma, mechanical; 
Mortar Board, senior women’s hon­
orary; Cwens, women’s sophomore 
honorary, and Alpha Chi Alpha, 
women’s journalistic honorary.
The program will be held in the | 
open air theater. In order that the 
remarks of the speakers may reach 
all of those present, a public address 
system has been arranged. The presi- 
dents of all organizations making 
calls arc requested to turn their lists
of those who are to be tapped into
the “Y” officc tomorrow.
It is feared that Call Day may be 
abolished in the future if there is 
not a better attendance than there 
has becii in the past, and as a result
ofj_ this, there is a possibility that
the Festival might be shortened. For 
this reason and for the reason that 
everyone should be interested in the 
calls by the honoraries, it is advised 
that as many attend as possible.
Russian Film Is At­
traction At Lecture 
Hall
TAU BETA PI BANQUET 
TO BE HELD TONIGHT
“Ten Days That Shook < the 
World,” a screen version of ' the 
Russian Revolution, will be shown 
at the Carnegie Lecture Hall, Fri­
day and Saturday, May 8 and 9, 
at 8:30 p. m. This production, in­
terpreted as a "slice of intensified 
history,” necessitated the employ­
ment of 120,000 actors and required 
fully two years to complete. It is 
based on the book with the same 
title by John Reed, a prominent 
American journalist, who was an 
eye witness to the events that oc­
curred during the 1917 period of 
Russian history.
Beginning in March and extend­
ing to November, the Russiah 
Revolution gave rise to such his­
torically famous characters as Lenin, 
Kerensky, and Kornilov and equally 
significant bodies as the Bolsheviks, 
the Cossacks, the Duma Committee 
and the Soviet Committee. The 
violent street scenes that took place 
during March, which originated as 
an industrial strike and culminated 
in a revolution involving the Rus­
sian Army and several thousand 
University students, are again en­
acted in “Ten Days That Shook 
the World,” whidi is a day by day 
record of these events.
The film, which has been ap­
proved by Sinclair Lewis, winner 
of the Noble Prize, was produced 
in Russia under the direction of 
Sergey Eisenstein. It is presented 
at the Carnegie Lecture Hall under 
the auspices of the Art Film Bu­
reau. Tickets, at 50 cents each, 
may be secured at Mellor’s, 604 
Wood street.
The annual banquet of Tau Beta 
Pi, national engineering honorary, 
will be held tonight at 6:30 at the 
Penn Lincoln hotel in Wilkinsburg. 
An invitation is extended to all 
faculty members and alumni of the 
fraternity. For further information 
and definite arrangements these men 
should see R. O. Holmes at the 
Theta Xi house.
The initiation of the pledges from 
the Spring call will take place at 5 
o’clock this afternoon in the Faculty 
clubroom. The men to be initiated in­
to the fraternity arc: P. F. Wile, J. 
I, Bohnert, H. S. Seifert, H. D. 
Kolb, H. J. Cohen, H. R. Evans, J. 
E. Morris, and I. J.. Karrassik. Elec­
tion of the officers of the fraternity 
for next year will take place either 
tonight or at the regular weekly 
meeting next Thursday evening.
At a previous meeting the fratern­
ity voted an award to the engineer­
ing freshman who finishes his first 
year with the highest average in his 
class. The award will be presented | 
in the fall of the succeeding year, 
and will be in the form of a first- 
class engineering handbook. The 
fraternity believes that this will be a 
inducement for improvement in fresh­
man scholarship, and that it will do

Players Close 
Season Tonight 
With Ibsen Play
Playhouse Group Con­
cludes Fifth Season 
of Activity
Tlii Y. M. and W. H. A. Play- 
house’s presentation this evening of 
Henrik Ibsen’s “Ghosts” marks the 
last performance of the organiza­
tion for the currcnt season. The 
Playhouse ends its fifth year of 
existence as a civic theater with a 
Yehicle that has been a storm- 
center of furious discussion since 
its first performance in 1881. The 
first of the famous Norwegian 
playwright’s - critical dissections of 
the modern social order, "Ghosts” 
raised a hubbub which has not yet 
subsided. In England, due to the 
vituperous -attacks of self-righteous 
critics and moralists, it was put 
off the English-stage and still may 
not be produced in that country, 
In America, however, the first ap­
pearance of "Ghosts” was a great 
success, and numerous revivals 
have been made of it.
Helen R. Stout, director of the 
play, and Frank Stout, supervisor 
of settings, are both recently of the 
Carnegie Drama School faculty, 
the latter as head of the Scenic 
Arts department. Previous to their

"ollegians Vie With Gangsters In 
Close Battle For Slang Supremacy
Gangsters versus collegians! Crook 
slang versus collegiate colloquialism! 
Is it true that common gangsters 
can create better—or should it be 
worse—slang words than can col­
lege students? A list of slang ex­
pressions used by the gunmen of 
the big cities, published recently in 
“American Speech” seems to indi­
cate this to be true. The collegiate 
cminencies wrathfully repel any 
such contention, declaring that from 
time immemorial they have been 
looked up to as setting the pace 
in slang pioneering. An immediate 
and peremptory comparison should 
' c made, therefore, before judg­
ment is passed.
Just as life (and death) to the 
criminal revolves about the electric 
chair, so the student’s life (and 
death) rotates about the examina­
tion chaiir. Naturally, then, the 
most vivid slang should spring up 
with these subjects \as pedestals. 
As appropriate synonyms for the 
electric chair, the gunman offers 
"hot chair,” "Old Smoky,” and the 
Hot Squat,” while he describes 
the process as “getting burned.” 
These are original and commend­
able, perhaps, but please weigh 
-vliat the college class advances as I 
s bids for applause.
To “flunk” a course and 
flopped on the final” show excel­
lent ingenuity, do they not? As 
analogous to the above, the Uni­
versity of Missouri has “busting a 
course,” while “pop quiz" means 
unexpected examination. But sus­
pend your ballots while the thrpe- 
inch foreheads, are allowed to show 
the one-inch foreheads, a trick or 
two in this linguistic spitting con­
test which threatens to topple the 
college student from his exalted, 
time-honored position as Chief 
Slang Inventor.
Sex derivatives most assuredly 
ought to reveal both combatants 
at their best while on common 
ground.
A “broad” to the pistol-mcn is 
an ordinary young female, and 
“sweets” are sweethearts. From the 
list no more sex allusions can be 
found! The collegians will say 
“that's ba-a-ad,” and then hurl a 
volley of their most brilliant and 
colossal tongue-twisters back: “she’s 
cute as a bug’s car,” “Forbes Hall 
femmes,” “slick,” “keen,” and “red 
hot mama.” But the most scintil­
lating colloquialism is that invented 
by a western college where “you 
and the other giraffes” i.s an in-

The following officers were elect­
ed by Scalp and Blade at a meet­
ing Jield on Wednesday evening, 
April 29, at the Kappa Delta Rho 
house: President, Jack L. Kronen- 
berg, ’33; vice president, Jack J. 
Delaney, ’33; secretary, Gordon 
Muckley, ’33, and treasurer, Alfred 
Pryce-Jones, ’34.
Kroncnberg is also treasurer of 
the Industries Senate and is a 
member of Beta Theta Pi, social 
fraternity, Delaney is a member 
of Kappa Delta Rho fraternity; 
Muckley belongs to Sigma Nu and 
Pryce-Jones to Phi Kappa Psi.
The Scalp and Blade, which is a 
national honorary organization for i 
Buffalo men, will make its spring | 
call during campus week, and an 
initiation banquet will be held soon 
after. The organization will con­
tinue the practice this year of 
presenting a cup Afor the winning 
design in the Fraternity Sweep­
stakes. This cup is now held by 
the Theta Xi fraternity.
Affiliation with the alumni asso­
ciation of his college is something 
which each graduate should consider 
seriously. Becoming a member of the 
Carnegie Alumni Federation with its 
more than six thousand graduates 
and former student members, is a 
comparatively simple matter, but this 
membership brings to the graduate 
a means of contact with his Alma 
Mater which no other campus or­
ganization can give him.
As in the past two years, a cam­
paign offering membership to the 
seniors at a reduccd rate for the 
first year after graduation, is to be 
conducted by the Alumni Federation 
with the co-operation of the senior 
class officers and departmental agents- 
A student representative of your de­
partment will talk to you further 
about the plan. The third Alumni 
membership drive among the present 
seniors of the four colleges starts 
this month.
Alumni membership dues arc reg­
ularly $3.00 a year, beginning in 
July. To all seniors who pay their 
alumni dues before Commencement 
Day, June 9, a spccial rate of $2.00 
for the year July 1, 1931-June 30, 
1932, will be made. This will en­
title the alumnus to receive the 
alumni magaine published five times 
during the college year, October, 
December, February, April, and 
June—one issue of which is a 
directory number containing the 
names and addresses of all grad­
uates, and those former students 
who have joined the association. 
It will make the graduate a mem­
ber in good-standing in the alumni 
association. Paid-up membership 
will bring the alumnus news of the 
school and of his classmates, and 
enable him to keep in touch with 
the institution’s activities and de-1 
velopmcnt. Through the co-opera­
tion of departments closely allied 
with the interests of C. I. T. alum-

R.O.T.C. Companies 
To Hold Competitive 
Drill This Thursday
On Thursday morning the six 
companies of the Carnegie Reserve 
Officers Training Corps will hold 
competitive drill which will be judged 
on the mechanical precision of move­
ment, the ability of the commander 
to give commands and to' see that 
they are carried out, and the com­
pany’s skillful execution of the 
orders. This will be a close order 
drill. The captain of the winning 
company is to receive a handsomely 
engraved sabre. The other members 
of the winning company are to be 
awarded with a service ribbon of 
Carnegie plaid and the company itself 
will be entitled to carry the Plaid 
Guidon until the next competition.
At President Baker’s annual re­
view of the R. O. T. C. companies 
next Friday morning a plaque will 
be awarded signifying the winning 
of third place in William Randolph 
I-Icarst’s Trophy Rifle March. In­
dividual medals will be presented to 
members of the winning rifle team 
by a representative of the Hcarst's 
publishing company. This is the third 
year that the Carnegie riflemen, 
representing the R. O. T. C., have 
won third place in thesq matches.
Lieutenant Wiley V. Carter, First 
Lieutenant of the Signal Corps, and 
assistant professor in Military Science 
and Tactics at Carnegie for the past 
four years will leave for Rutgers 
University where he will take a 
course in meteorology for one, year 
beginning next September. Lieutenant 
Carter’s presence on the Carnegie 
campus will be greatly missed. He 
will not return to Carnegie as one 
of the military commanders here, ,
The Coronation Ball on Thurs­
day night, the Costume Ball on 
Friday night and- the Cabaret Tea 
Dance on Saturday afternoon are 
the three dances which will take 
place during the Spring Carnival- 
Dancing will be held in both the 
gymnasium and the Union. Tho 
Krushinski Brothers will play, ,ili 
the Union both nights and in thO 
Gym on Saturday afternoon. Toni 
Care and his West Virginians will 
furnish the music in the Gym on 
Thursday and Friday evenings. • 
Orchestra Well Known.
The Krushinski Brothers’ Or­
chestra have already gained wide 
renown in the Pittsburgh area dur­
ing its past 12 years in the district. 
Aside from playing at many popu­
lar restaurants, the Krushinski 
Brothers have furnished the music 
at many collegiate affairs in Pitts­
burgh. This orchestra is coming 
here after a long engagement in 
export. Tom Care and his West 
Virginians have recently ' become 
very popular in the Ohio River 
Valley districts. The West Vir­
ginians have played at many Ohio 
State University functions.
A huge crystal ball which wjll 
bear reflections from innumerable 
eolored lights will illuminate the 
gymnasium. The Union will be 
decorated in colored lights and 
white . lattice work. Additional illu­
mination will be unnecessary here.
The Coronation Ball will imhre- 
diatcly follow the crowning of the 
Campus Queen.
Costumes Required 
No'onc will be admitted to the 
Costumc Ball on Friday evening 
unless he is in costumc. Tho 
committee urges that no one go to 
any elaborate planning or expense 
but rather go in the spirit of tijc: 
Costume Ball by wearing any sort 
of costumc as long as it is different 
from every , day clothes. ' Many 
fraternities have already planned 
on wearing a uniform costume. 
This dance will replace the High* 
land Fling of last year, where 
Scotch costumes were worn, and 
the elaborate Mardi Gras of forme.:- 
years.
Tables and a floor show which 
will include two professional danc ­
ers and a "blues” singer will fur-

Tennis Squads Begin 
Season With Wins 
In Four Encounters
Exhibition Wrest 
Match To Be 
May 20
An exhibition wrestling match, open 
to all students, will be held in the 
gym on Wednesday, May 20. This 
will be the very first appearance of 
this sport at Carnegie, and probably 
the initial intcr-collcgiate match for 
Pittsburgh.
The purpose of the competition 
is to determine whether there is suf­
ficient material and interest about the 
campus to support a Plaid wrestling 
team for next year. The call for 
candidates of a few weeks ago 
brought out a goodly number that, 
with additional practicc, could put 
the activity on a running basis. Since 
then about a dozen have been work­
ing out in the gym.
However, the competition to be 
held this month is not limited to 
those already in the sport, but in­
cludes any ncw*comcrs who would 
like to try a hand or foot in the 
mat game. Enterics should be record­
ed in the Graduate Manager’s office 
by May 13.
The various shapes and sizes will 
mean no advantage in the tussle, 
for the enterics will be divided into 
the 115, 125, 135, 145, 155, 165, 175, 
and unlimited classes. Mr. J. C. 
Rintelen, instructor in the Chemical 
Engineering Department, is coaching 
every afternoon in the "strong room” 
of the gym. Sargent Sommer is also 
a source of information on the sub­
ject of getting in, and out, of the 
various holds.
addition to being a fast man in 
lanes.
Wednesday the Yearlings turned 
in their third win of the season by 
defeating the Schcnlcy High track­
ers 74 to 26. Haley lead the indi­
vidual scoring with 10^2 points. 
These were scored as a result of 
firsts in the hundred and broad 
jump, and a third place tie in the 
high jump. Forsman followed up 
with 10 points from the shot and 
discus. Schell, consistent as ever, 
won the mile, and Carr had lit­
tle trouble in taking the quarter.
The high jump was won by Big­
gin, who also placed second in 
the hurdles. Edelblut broke the 
tape in the hurdles and threw the 
discuss for a second place. Hills 
took carc of the pole vault, and 
the meet closed with each team 
winning one of the relays.

The varsity and freshman tennis 
squads pulled through their first week 
of competition without a mishap, the 
varsity primming Bethany 5-4 at 
Bethany on Wednesday and smother­
ing Duquesne on Friday 6-1 on the 
I-Iilltoppcrs’ courts. The Freshmen 
trimmed Shadysidc on Thursday 4-2 
and again cam? through the follow­
ing day with an easy 6*1 triumph 
over the Duquesne Freshmen; both 
of these matches were played on the 
Carnegie courts.
At Bethany the varsity found the 
going somewhat tougher than ex­
pected, but there was little doubt as 
to who had the better balanced 
squad. “Stew” Dueger, Tartan No. 1. 
man, again starred, winning his 
singles match handily.
The Freshman had little opposition 
in either of their meets, although 
Shadyside showed strength in some 
positions. Hartig, who has been burn­
ing up the courts this season, looked 
impressive in winning his singles 
match.
Monday the varsity engages the W. 
and J. varsity here, while the Fresh­
men travel to Washington to take 
on the Junior Proxies. Wednesday 
the Plebcs travel to Duquesne, and 
on Saturday Geneva will visit the 
campus for a joust with the varsity.
Carnegie Tech’s track team con­
tinued its winning streak by de­
feating the strong University of 
Cincinnati track squad Saturday 
afternoon in the Tech bowl by 
the score of 69 1/3 to 65 2/3. The 
meet was very close and interest­
ing throughout and was not decid­
ed until the javelin throw, the final 
event of the afternoon. Before 
this last event, the Plaid was be­
hind by five and one-third points, and 
needed a first and a third in the 
javelin to capture the meet. Stcntz, 
Murray and Brindcl came through 
and took all three places, thus de­
ciding the meet.
The Skibo schedule of track rec­
ords will need a thorough going 
over at the end of the present sea­
son if this record breaking 1931 
team keeps going at the pace that 
it has in the last several meets. 
Saturday one record was broken 
and one equaled, both by that 
fleet-footed basketball captain, 
George Ncase. In the century 
dash, Nease showed his heels to
the rest of the field and breezed 
in at the fast time of ten scconds 
flat, equaling the school record set 
by John Kelly quite a few years 
ago. After a short rest, Nease
got away to a fast start and finished 
well in the lead. The time was 22 and 
4/10 seconds, a new school record
and remarkable time, considering 
the condition of the track and the 
sharp turn.
, In several of the events, the
Plaid men were considerably off 
form and were unable to come up 
to their usual standard. Seyboth, 
failed to place in the shotput and 
Captain Barger, with a sore muscle, 
could only gain a tic for second 
place in the pole vault.
The Plaid runners showed their 
greatest weakness in the quarter 
and half mile, being able to take 
only one point out of a possible 
18. The only place gained in these 
two events was third, by Magnu- 
son, in the quarter. Coulter would 
probably have taken this event 
easily, but he war, I^cpt out and 
saved for the hurdles.
Tom Coulter was again high 
scorer, earning 13 points for the 
Tartans. Tom won the 120-yard 
high hurdles and also the 220 low 
hurdles. When it became appar­
ent that a few points were needed 
in the broad jump, Tom entered 
and gained a second plaec. John 
Karel8 again won the discus with 
a hcftVc of 124 feet 9*/j inches, and 
took a second place in the shot 
put.
Ed Stent* has been coming right 
iiloiVg in the javelin, and with a 
little more practice, Eel has a good 
chance of breaking the ochool rec­
ord. Ed heaved the spear 168 feet 
3 inches.
Last week was an eventful one 
for the, Plate track team. Monday

Night Student Council Inter-Night College Dance To Be Big Affair
Art Giles and His Famous 
Dance Orchestra to 
Furnish Music
Well, it’s mush now—I mean 
they are playing mush ball on the 
campus. This seems to be the big 
sport at the present time, indulged 
in by the students who arc close 
to the campus. By the way they 
swing the bat there should be some 
professional talent developed before 
long. Some of the major leagues 
(should have their scouts out look­
ing the material over. They even 
call a man out when he reaches 
the base before the ball is caught 
by the base-man. Ain’t that some­
thing. It’s all in the game of 
sport, anyway.
Yes, I have' another idea, and
this one is really good. Now that
we have the daylight time in which 
to go to night school, we can see
what is going on and what the
campus looks like. Yes, they real­
ly have them on the lawn—dande­
lions. The place seems to be full 
of them. It is a dandy line. My 
idea is this: Put all the freshmen, 
night and day, at digging up the 
weed. This would make a grand 
stunt for an initiation or a plebe 
regulation. They couldn’t miss the 
yellow flowers and it would be a 
grand sight to see the student body 
get back to nature once again. 
Fritz would certainly welcome 
this. regulation. Now I won’t be 
surprised if I see a couple hundred 
of the students, knife and basket 
) in hand, digging up the makings 
i —yes, you can make wine from the 
flowers—and this should be anoth­
er reason for putting the rule into 
force.
Speaking of Fritz, though, I was 
amused at the way he raved dur­
ing the exhibition night. It seems 
that all of Pittsburgh wanted to 
walk on lawns and disregard the 
walks. He was hopping around 
like mad. Bet he could cheerfully 
murder a hundred or so of these 
people. I noticed one place in 
particular, near the bulletin board 
at the Cut, there is a wire strung 
across to prohibit trespassing. 
Well, there' were, several people 
caught in the wire, and you should 
have been there to hear Fritz lec­
ture them. Sure did -give me a 
thrill. He didn’t carc who was 
around, lie simply said it, and I’ll 
bet those people won't walk on 
any grass or lawns in the future. 
I don't believe I ever saw him so 
animated and so serious before. 
And then to think the Army and 
the Kiltie Band walked on his 
grass too. This surely must be 
a sore thought for him. Wonder 
how they got away with it, that is, 
without hearing from him, because 
you know that his lawn is the 
most important thing at Carnftgie. 
But that is the gardener's view­
point and not ours.
Wouldn’t it be a fine thing if 
some of these prowlers who are 
removing property from the parked 
cars would run off with these yel­
low horses which adorn the cam­
pus? I don't know how or why 
they have escaped being taken so 
long, maybe, it’s because of the 
color. Who’d want a pair of yel­
low horses? If they were painted 
green they wouldn’t look so bad, 
but yellow looks as if the campus 
had a streak of yellow or some­
thing like it. And why have the 
horses, anyway? They do not 
beautify the quadrangle one bit, but 
rather detract from it. If a peti­
tion to have the yellow horses 
driven away would mean some­
thing, I’d be the first one to sub­
scribe to it. If they planted 4 few 
trees in the middle of the drive it 
would help matters, but those ter­
rible yellow horses—wow.
Believe it or not, but they actu­
ally have other uses for the bal­
cony in Arts than just Music. It’s 
just like this. I ping and you 
pong. There is a table located 
there and for want of better use 
a certain couple play that fascinat­
ing game of Ping Pong. The fair 
coed who pings, I almost told you 
who she is, but I didn’t, you’ll 
have to come and see for yourself. 
At an}' rate, they are at it late and 
early.
Well, the Thistle is making its 
appearance again this year. It’s a 
wonder all the thistles aren't pluck­
ed from the school, judging by the 
number which are sold and which 
have been .issued each year. The 
book is a fine one—yes, I bought 
one last year, and I like to look it 
over every once in a while in my 
spare moments, and I sure to get a 
kick out of it. You know they 
have a real night section for us 
and there arc a number of pic­
tures of your classmen in it. I 
believe I will order another this 
year, so as to be sure they won’t 
sell out.
Well, there you are, -the Inter- 
Night College Dance has been set 
back a day. Well, that’s good 
news, because I like the Saturday 
night dances better than the other 
night dances. It seems there is 
more time for everything, even if 
you do have to quit the dance an 
hour earlier. This is the one big 
dance of the year. It comes after 
that fray with the faculty when

The final affair on the Night 
Student Council social calendar, 
the Inter-Night College Dance, 
will be held this Saturday evening 
in the men’s gymnasium. The 
date of this affair had originally 
been set for Friday evening, May 
8, but as the Campus Carnival had 
later been set for the same week­
end, the Night Student Council, 
who had previously engaged the 
gym for their dance, agreed to the 
day’s postponement that the Cam­
pus Carnival might progress with­
out interruption.
The social committee has been 
successful in securing Art Giles’ 
orchestra for the frolic. Not much 
more need be said of the music, 
for this organization is well known, 
having played at many of the large 
hotels in this city and elsewhere. 
Syncopation, rhythm, etcetera, will 
be the keynote of the evening.
School is over, that is, except 
for those who like punishment and 
signed up for a supplementary 
term, and everyone no doubt, feels 
likt cutting loose for a good time. 
The dance this week-end is your 
opportunity. Come out and say so 
long to your fellow student with 
whom you labored through the 
long winter months. If you be­
lieve you did well in the exams, 
come out and celebrate. If you be­
lieve you flunked, come out and 
be consolcd; have your cares and 
worries driven away.
There will be refreshment^, of 
course. The novelties are still 
up a tree, but that docs not mean 
that they will be monkeys or 
cocoanuts. All in all it will be a 
typical N. S. C. dance, so get busy 
and sign up the best g. f. for the 
evening and be on hand. Remem­

ANOTHER SUCCESS
WORM’S EYE VIEWS 
or
FROM THE GUTTER
As Christopher Columbus — or 
was it Will Rodgers—once said, 
Pittsburgh Promotes Progress.” 
Pittsburgh, the city of steel (spell­
ing optional), the metropolis of 
elect-trick” power, the port of 
air-“graft” commerce, upholds the 
boast, promotes the tradition, and 
confirms the creed of industrial and 
governmental efficiency (applause). 
One of the most perfect models 
of Pittsburgh efficiency that has 
been disclosed in recent years is 
the air port project. The ingcnui 
t3r shown by the County Commis 
sioncrs in handling the bids was 
positively outstanding, the secret 
of their success lying (Amen) in 
their financial genius which con 
trived to spend Pittsburgh’s money 
and yet keep it at home—? That 
was made possible by the phe­
nomenal and heretofore .unaccom­
plished feat of giving the contract 
to the highest bidder! 1 1 "How?" 
say you? The company is a Pitts- 
burgh corporation, so the extra 
money was to go into Pittsburgh 
pockets (it did) and give Pitts 
burgh men work (apply 1302 Grant 
building—wc did). But wait, you 
haven’t seen half of this air port 
yet—it isn’t half done! 1 Yet, it 
was supposed to nave been com­
pleted a year ago. Why has it not 
been finished? Again the ingcn 
uity of our Commissioners shines 
forth to brighten up our darkening 
countenances. By delaying the 
completion until the ccntennial cele­
bration of the invention of the 
airplane, which by unconfirmed re­
port, will be held here, there will 
be no necessity for repairs as the 
field will be brand new. (Laughter) 
It should be stated here, also, that, 
another bond issue for $1,000,000 
has been floated (this is not, to 
be confused with a sinking fund, 
which is used only for subways, 
which will be discussed later). The 
justification for this issue lies in 
the fact that-an airport must have 
runways and hangars—ours is to 
have one—the million won’t go far. 
(Hysterics) As we sec it, the air 
port project illustrates in full meas­
ure the high degree of Pittsburgh’s 
industrial and govdrnmental effi­
ciency. The usual offering will 
now be received.
The program for the Spring Car­
nival has been set and everything 
will be in readiness for the festivi­
ties next Thursday evening, w'hen 
the Coronation Ball will commence, 
followed shortly by the coronation 
of the Campus Queen.
The theme of the Pageant, which 
will culminate in the crowning of 
the queen is taken from a Wag­
nerian opera and portrays a prince 
charming overcoming a fire in or­
der that he may win his queen.
Night students have the privilege 
of purchasing tags for the carnival, 
and these have been on sale since 
last Thursday evening. Eacli night 
student is permitted to purchase 
two tags, and the registration card 
purchase. The tags will cost $1.50 
each. Sale of tags will end Thurs­
day, May 7.
Another social success has been 
scored by the Night College of 
Fine Arts in the form of a dance 
which was held Saturday evening, 
April 25. The dance, originally 
scheduled for April 11, was post­
poned .until April 25, so that there 
would be no conflict with the Arts 
Ball and Post Arts Ball, which 
were held on April 10 and 11.
Each time the Union has been 
decorated differently by the com­
mittee in charge-’ of the work, but 
this time they seemed to outdo 
themselves. The hall was beauti­
fully decorated in many colors with 
a decorative scheme which had not 
been used before.
En. Bocchicchio and his. orches­
tra were on hand and furnished 
the music for the evening. They 
seem to sense the type of music 
desired by those present for the 
encores were many and long.
Refreshments, as usual, were 
plentiful, and were partaken of by 
the dancers.
Mr. and Mrs. Ralph M. Young 
Avere the guests and chaperons of 
the evening.
The committee who worked up 
(the dance is to be commended for 
the very fine affair given by them 
to the students in the Night Col­
lege of Fine Arts. These untiring 
workers have been giving of their 
time all during the year to make 
the dances successful, and they 
have achieved wonderful results. It 
is fitting on the part of the night 
students in the Night College of 
Fine Arts to remember these work­
ers and the extra time they have 
spent to make it possible for you 
to enjoy 3rourselves.

H. E. Mauro, Social Chairman
It is almost an insult to the in­
telligence of the readers of this page 
that a definition of the word cul­
ture need be made. However, while 
speaking to some of the night en­
gineers it was a surprise to learn 
that the word culture was a vague, 
ill-defined and in some instances al­
most an, unknown term. One spoke 
of the culture of plants and bees.
Another contemptuously answered that 
he supposed if one was cultured one 
had to dab paint on a canvas or
wear long hair and pound discordant 
tunes out of a piano. For the present 
we may regard culture as the train­
ing, disciplining or refining of the 
moral and intellectual nature.
The basis of all culture is the de­
velopment of a philosophy of life. 
The engineer and scientist can aid 
a great deal in this advancement by 
building upon truths instead of 
groping about for ideas in mid-air 
and skillfully transferring them to 
print as has heretofore been done 
by abstract thinkers. At the same 
time it would be well if the engineers 
would not sneer too openly at the 
classical school of thought. The pres­
ent neod is the merging of this classi­
cal school with the modern school 
of science. As all the old philosophers 
failed to give us a clear picture of 
their philosophy, so present day 
scientists have also failed in their 
one sided presentation. The one 
delved too. deeply into pure thought 
without practical confirmation, where­
as, the other becomes so absorbed in 
the gathering of facts and the sifting 
of practical ideas into useful tools 
that the ultimate goal was lost to 
view.
Directly and indirectly the engineer 
may contribute to the culture of the 
world. How, you ask? First, by the 
broadening of culture, in the sense 
most generally accepted, to include 
the .view-point of pure and applied 
science. This would result in a ful­
ler conception of life and. its mean­
ing since the philosopher could add 
to his store of knowledge all of 
the facts unearthed by science. Sec-

SUCCESSFUL DINNER VACATED BY AUGUST 1
On Saturday evening, April 25, 
the Industrial Education Section of 
the College of Industries held a 
successful dinner at the Carnegie 
Inn Dining Room. This is the an­
nual dinner given by the students 
in this department and a very large 
group of students was present.
The guests of the evening were 
Mr. David Jackey, California State 
Normal College; Dr. A. M. Gold- 
bergcr and Dr. G. D. Whitney of 
the University of Pittsburgh; Mr. J. 
M. Speer of the Pittsburgh Board 
of Education, and Director A. C. 
Jewett, Professor R. B. Lcigliou, 
Professor G. U. Clceton, and Mr. 
E. H. Smith of Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. Many interesting 
talks were given by the guests 
along educational lines, and of 
particular note was the talk given, 
by Mr. Jackey, who is a former 
graduate of Carnegie, and now con 
nected with the California State 
Normal College at Chico, Califor­
nia.
Several of last year's graduates, 
were present and the dinner served 
as a reunion of the present and 
former students of this department.
Notice has just been posted on 
the bulletin boards that all lockers 
must be vacated by August 1. This 
means that all those night students 
who do not remove their property 
from the lockers will lose it, as 
the lockers will be emptied of the 
contents and any property found 
therein will be confiscated.
The new arrangement in force 
this year of selling the locks to 
the students obviates the necessity 
of returning the keys to locker key 
room. The locks which were pur­
chased become the property of the 
students, but this does not mean 
that the lockers assigned can be re­
tained indefinitely. Therefore, all 
night students are cautioned to 
make sure that their property is 
removed before the final date, Au­
gust 1.
At the fall registration new as­
signments of lockers will be made 
according to the location of the 
shops and laboratories where the 
students are scheduled, and to car­
ry out this plan it is necessary 
that all lockers be , surrendered. 
The management in charge of the 
lockers expects your co-operation 
in carrying out the scheme and wc 
know the night students will re­
spond.

ondly, the idea of tolerance could be 
more generally promoted. Surely the 
musician who is the master of the 
organ is no more cultured than the 
man who, by the use of applied 
science, has made possible this in­
strument. Then too, since there arc 
so many types of people in- this 
world who differ so widely in tastes, 
manners, and morals, it might be 
well to engender within the mind 
of the engineer a tolerance of those 
tastes, manners, and morals which 
are seemingly undesirable. Thirdly, 
the engineer and scientist may start 
from the field of science and build 
upon a firm foundation of truth a 
new philosophy comprising both the 
elements of sccncc and classical ideas. 
Thus by having the one school ab­
sorb the ideas of the other, in time, 
a common ground would be reached 
whcrcfrom a new insight into every­
thing may be had upon a more posi­
tive and surer footing. The last con­
tribution which the engineer miy 
make to culture is one which is most 
generally attributed to him. That is 
the development of all of the modern 
machines and conveniences which 
have added so much already to the 
progress of civilization, the possi­
bilities of the enjoyment of greater 
comfort, and leisure and the les­
sening of suffering, misery, and dis­
aster.
The engineering profession stands 
second to none. The greatest material 
advancement has been made possible 
through the work of engineers. Be­
cause the engineer holds the key to 
future prosperty, because he makes pos­
sible the greater enjoyment of case 
and leisure and has the opportunity 
of lessening sordid drudgery and 
care, it behooves him to take a 
broader and more comprehensive view 
of both life and the world and its 
inhabitants so that all future growth 
may be made with the assurance of 
the greatest possible returns in hap­
piness, in the promotion of knowl­
edge, and in the conviction that this 
advancement will lead to higher and 
more noble avenues of thought 
rather than to the plunging of the 
world into the darkest depths of, un­
happiness, despair, and wretchedness.
F.S.
A letter mailed from Tech on 
September 26, 1921, was returned 
to the postofficc the . other day, 
somewhat the worse for wear and 
wandering, with no clues as to 
why 10 years were required to 
ascertain the whereabouts of the 
addressee. There were several 
postmarks of cities in New York 
and Long Island near Corona, its 
intended destination.
The letter will be forwarded to 
the sender, Dimitri Demetrius Di- 
.mancescu, who .graduated from the 
College of Industries in 1922, sup­
porting himself during his four 
years at T cch. Previous to his 
attendance at Tech he had served 
his .country, Roumania, for three 
years on the Eastern front during 
the World War; entering Tech in 
September, 1920, still suffering from 
wounds received in the battle of 
Oituz, where he was shot down. 
At present he is actively connected 
with the Roumanian diplomatic 
service. King Carol recently ap­
pointed him president of the Coun­
cil of Ministers at Bucharest, 
choosing him for this important 
post because of his knowledge of 
American customs and affairs.

Night,students who arc contcm-: 
plating returning to Carnegie next 
fall and want to sec the football 
games, would do well to place 
their reservations now for scats. 
As night registration is not until 
the first part of October, ‘which has 
heretofore been the earliest time 
that tickcts were available for night 
students, most of the choice re­
served seats will have been taken 
by that time.
The Tartan schedule for next 
fall is rather an imposing one and 
reservations arc already coming in. 
The Notre Dame game will in 
probability be a sell-out and with 
the other headliners on the card, 
the chances for obtaining a suitable 
pasteboard later in the year will 
be rather slim.
Students wishing to avail them­
selves of this privilege should 
write, phone or call Clarence Over- 
end, Graduate Manager, Gymna­
sium, Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology. Phone Mayflower 2929. 
Tickcts ordered now need not be 
paid for until August 1, 1931.

Adds New Gas 
Furnace
A huge gas-fired furnace has
been recently installed in the
Electro-Metallurgical Laboratory in 
Engineering Hall, to be used in 
connection with the new hot roll­
ing mill of the Metallurgical De­
partment as well as for research 
purposes.
Weighing over fqur tons, the
new furnace is a valuable acquisi­
tion, since it is the only large gas 
furnace that the Metallurgical De­
partment possesses. It is claim6d 
that a temperature of 3200 degrees 
Fahrenheit, 900 degrees above tlu: 
melting point of steel, can be ob­
tained with the furnace. The other
furnaces of the Metallurgical De­
partment are located in the Gradu 
ate Laboratory, and arc all electri­
cally operated with carborundum 
resistance dieatcrs.
Mixing valves, with the neces­
sary accessories, arc attached to 
mix the air and gas at low and 
high pressures.
Only a very short time remains 
which to order that Thistle 
which you promised yourself, A 
limited number of copies of the 
book has been ordered and after 
these arc gone there will not be 
any more for sale.
A big response has been receiv­
ed to the individual letter which 
was sent to each night student 
whose picture will appear in the 
book. There arc, however, a few 
students who have not sent in their 
order, so your attention is called 
to the fact that unless your order 
is placed for a copy, none will be. 
reserved and when the supply is 
exhausted it will be just too bad, 
as this year's annual will be com­
plété in every way. It is a history 
of the ytfir, and many night stu­
dents will cherish having a copy 
in later years.
Orders for the book should be 
sent to H. E. Mauro, Night Busi­
ness Manager, 1931 Thistle, Box 
137, C. T. T., Schenley Park, Pitts­
burgh, Pa., and mailed in prompt­
ly.
Citrhas Club
The annual banquet of the Citmas 
Club was held Wednesday, April 22, 
at which time the officers for the 
coming year were announced. The 
new officers arc: Prof. E. G. Olds, 
Assistant Professor of Mathematics, 
president; Prof. C. W. Princ, Asso­
ciate Professor of Physics, vice presi­
dent, and Mr. R. V. Davis, treasurer.
Prof. I-I. K. Kirkpatrick was chair­
man and toastmaster of the banquet 
which was the last meeting of the 
year for the organization which is 
composed of master masons among 
the faculty and students of Car­
negie.
Prof. T. R. Alexander, Jr., was the 
speaker of the evening with an ac­
count of his recent visit to Germany.
The success of this year’s system 
of gct-to-gether meetings has prompt­
ed the organization to plan for next 
year’s meetings in the same way.

ni, the Carnegie Tartan is sent cacli 
week to all paid-up members of 
the association. Notices of .alumni 
affairs such as alumni home-coming, 
held each year at the time of the. 
Pitt-Tech football games, class re­
unions, football ticket information, 
teas, dances, smokers, bridges, etc., 
arc sent out to all members in 
good standing in the association.
A brief explanation of the or­
ganization of the Alumni Federal 
tion might be of interest to you 
who arc about to become members 
of this group. Each college has 
its own individual alumni associa­
tion, College of Fine Arts, Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie College, 
College of Engineering, and Col­
lege of Industries. These individ­
ual alumni associations have gov­
erning boards of ten members each, 
elected for a two year term of 
office by the paid-up members of 
the individual associations. The 
president, secretary, and alumni 
representative elected by each ol 
these four groups comprise the 
membership of the Federation 
Board of Governors, which is aug­
mented by the election of two 
mcmbers-at-largc from the general 
alumni body, anil the alumni trus.- 
tecs, making a total membership 
of sixteen on the governing board 
for the combined alumni associa­
tions. All matters of alumni policy 
arc referred to the four individual 
college associations, and their deci­
sions acted upon by the Federation 
Board of Governors.
The alumni organization has its 
own office, located in the Gymna­
sium Building, and is self-support­
ing. Us function is lo keep the 
alumni informed of college activi­
ties and policies, and to keep in 
touch at all limes with 'its gradu­
ates, The alumni mngazini is 
published through this office, all 
alumni campaigns and matters of 
alumni interest arc handled by ill. 
The organization maintains the 
services of a full time secretary 
who is there to co-operate all in 
phases of college activities in which 
alumni interests are involved. Mr. 
Clarence "Buddy" Overend, Gradu­

We were able lo sccurc the club 
rooms formerly occupied by the 
Princeton Club, which recently 
joined with the Yale and Harvard 
groups, and now have a Carnegie 
Tech Club, located at 421 Fifth 
avenue, opposite Kaufmann’s. The 
club is equipped with an attractive 
lounge, and a dining room. . A sec­
retary is on duty during the week­
days, from 11 to 5 o'clock. By spe­
cial arrangement the club rooms 
may be used in the evenings for 
group meetings. Membership fees 
of this group have been kept at 
minimum, $10 for a resident mem­
bership (for alumni located within 
25 miles of Pittsburgh), and $5 for 
non-resident membership (for alum­
ni located 25 miles beyond Pitts­
burgh). Each of these member­
ships include the usual alumni dues 
fee, which is turned over to the 
Alumni Federation.
The officers of the senior classes 
of all four colleges meeting with 
the Federation Board of Governors 
have sanctioned whoic-hcartcdly 
this plan for the third senior alum­
ni membership campaign, and it is 
with their approval that we solicit 
you lo join this graduate group 
who in this manner show their 
continued interest in C. I. T.
This year's goal is 100 per cent 
membership in all schools.
As a culmination of the mem­
bership campaign, each year one of 
the college alumni associations 
sponsors an informal dance .for' the 
seniors of all four colleges and 
their guests. In the past two years 
the Engineering and Arts associa­
tions were the hosts for these af­
fairs, This year the Alumni AsrV 
.socialion is to be host to the sen­
iors at a dance planned for Friday 
evening, May 29, in othe Union. 
These dances are a welcome from 
the general alumni body to the 
new members who by their gradu­
ation arc about to join the ranks of the 
alumni. Payments of alumni dues may 
be made to the class, agents, when 
membership blanks arc distributed,

The Extension Bulletin of the West­
ern State Teachers' College: "Cen­
turies ago Sophocles wrote ‘good for 
naught is either ship or state empty 
of men without; though strong men 
he within.' During the past year 
President Hopkins of Dartmouth Col­
lege while speaking before alumni 
gatherings from that institution has 
been substituting the word 'college' 
for 'ship or state,' and using tin 
quotation as follows: 'Good for
naught is the college, empty of men 
without; though strong men be with 
in.' He further says that the scope 
of the word 'within' is not complete 
until the boundaries arc established 
by the sweep of the circle which in­
cludes every graduate of the college, 
that the college is not an arcade 
or oneway street through which stu­
dents arc being herded and then dis­
missed, but rather it is the old con­
ception of a homestead in which the 
fires arc kept burning, the lights are 
kept bright, and as the family in­
creases there is hospitality for all.

society of the time is the objective

The Spring Carnival
The 1931 Spring Carnival opens Thursday night with the 
Coronation Bali and the Coronation of the May Queen. The Coronation ceremony will be held in front of Arts school and 
it is hoped that a re-occurance of the architects fiasco will not 
take place again this year. It is unfortunate that some of the architects will be on charette during the Carnival but we hope 
they will be good enough sports not to ruin the ceremony for everyone else as was done last year. Such an exhibition is not 
typical of college students, but is, instead, decidedly -kiddish, and 
not at all humorous.. The Coronation ceremony is . one of the few remaining 
traditions of the school and is conducted in a serious vein. The affair, however, .can not be put over successfully if a few weak 
minded individuals insist on pouring water and ringing alarm 
clocks. We believe this ye;tr’s group of architects are above such pranks. It is hoped that their conduct will prove us correct.
Qualifications
, During last year’s revival of the Spring Carnival, the Quali­fications ceremony consisted of. nothing more than Calls by the 
various honorary gwoups. This year, however, a more attractive 
and extensive program has been arranged and the committee is 
desirous of having as many attend it as attend the night func­tions. It is realized that thi£ ceremony will not be as attractive 
to as large a group as will the dances, but the Administration 
deems it one of the most important features of the Carnival and the future of. the annual Spring holidaj^ depends a great deal 
upon the attendance at the Qualifications exercises.
The, Administration is of the opinion that if the day func­tions are not better attended it is useless to have them, and 
they can see no reason to grant a holiday on Friday. If the students desire to have the Carnival retain its present propor­
tions it is their duty to be on the campus during the day and to take part in all the affairs listed on the program. If such an 
attitude is not assumed this year then the future Carnivals will consist of perhaps two dances held on Friday and Saturday evenings.
The Tartan urges the student body to follow the wishes of the committee, to attend the day functions, and thereby prove to 
the Administration that they are interested in more than the dances.
“Y” PLAYERS
(Continued from Page One) 
coming to Pittsburgh, five years 
ago, Mr. and Mrs. Stout were co- 
directors of the Poughkeepsie Com­
munity Theater. Following the 
present production^ they plan to 
leave for Europe, where, after a 
tour of the Continent, Mr. Stout 
will7 resume studies ;in art.
.The leading role of the play is 
• being taken by Alma Lind, a for­
mer Carnegie student. Opposite 
her1 in fhe masculine lead is Philip 
Greenwood, well known to* Play­
house patrons.
V “Ghosts” breaks with, Ibsen’s 
early period of romanticism. Wil­
liam Archer, a prominent critic, 
s.ays: of it: “It has done far more 
than any of his other plays to 
move boundary posts.” It has 
advanced the frontiers of dramatic 
art and implanted new ideals, both 
technical and intellectual, . in the 
minds of a whole generation of 
playwrights ... It is not, perhaps, 
the .poet’s greatest work, but cer­
tainly his noblest deed.”
- This evening’s performance be­
gins at 8:30 p. m. in the auditori­
um of the Y. M. and W. H. A. 
building at Bcllcfield street and 
Fifth avenue. Tickets arc SO cents.
COLLEGIANS VIE
(Continued from Page One) 
fercncc to neckcrs. Of course both 
sides will contend that “my babj'," 
or “some baby,” was born in the 
depths of its own ranks» But 
"baby” rightfully belongs to col­
legiate argot because the race pre­
servation of this social stratum 
depends upon it.
Stretch your imagination, if you 
can, to picture a representative 
gangster and a typical collegian 
arguing face to face about their 
excellence of slang. "Nick-names, 
we have better nick-names!” shouts 
the potential convict.
“You’re ‘woozy!’” returns the 
bookworm . and • thereby wins one
point. “Maybe ‘dick’ or ‘bull1 are 
picturesque titles for a detective, 
maybe ‘jigaboo’ is a colorful appcla- 
tion for Negro, as you say, or 
‘yegg’ for an undesirable citizen,’ 
or ‘axman’ for the prison barber, 
or ‘sin hound’ for the prison chap­
lain; but you’ll have to get better 
ones than those to beat ‘dizzy- 
Beau’ for an occupied Dean, or 
‘big shot’ for a campus elite with 
a swolen chest, or a ‘tea hound’ 
as the opposite of ‘you big beef.’”
But throwing an “ing-bing” means' 
going insane in the gangster’s 
tongue, so he snickers back: “You’re 
going ‘ing-binging,’ and if you’re 
not too ‘cock-eyed’ you’ll land in 
the ‘fit-house.’ ”
Then comes the climaxing (and 
sophisticated!) reply, "That’s all 
‘frazzle,’ moreover you’re ‘blooey,’ 
and besides my ‘oodles’ and ‘oodles’ 
of slang expressions are the ‘cat’s 
pajamas!’ Anything that ‘gripes’ 
me is to say ‘hack’ for an automo­
bile, as you racketeers must say. 
Why not originate something clever 
such as we have done for the Ford 
by calling it Leaping Lena, Lip- 
stick Lizzie, Chickens’ Coiip, Pas­
sion Pot, God’s gift to the co-ed, 
or Canned College Humor?”
WeU, it appears as .though the 
college student will win, providing 
he is not “pumped” with a bullet, 
speaking criminally. And Colgate 
University slang would have in­
tensified the victory. There, such 
high-powered expressions as “Pan­
ther sweat” for liquor, “pig-fight” 
for a tea dance, and “angel fac­
tory” for a theological seminary 
are in vogue.
Forever reign the collegian as the 
most competent slaughterer of the 
King's English!

With the- feeling that the Senior 
Ball of late surpassed our humble 
efforts to elaborate upon such an' 
affair, we received an old friend 
of yours and ours to help us out. 
With'1 pleasure, we offer—
Ladies and Gentlemen and Emery
Sutch!
The annual “Dance of the Drag­
ons,” known to the campus at large' 
as' the Senior Ball, is a thing of 
the past. And once again Master 
C. Willard Bryant showed us why 
Carnegie should give him a job as 
permanent chairman of Carnegie’s 
eocial functions, for the dance was 
a huge success, both socially and 
financially. The committee show­
ed, too, that favors, country clubs, 
and course dinners arc not essen­
tials for a successful evening, for 
with only puncli and cakps to stifle 
hunger, everyone of the four hun­
dred present Friday spent an en­
joyable evening. The punch and 
cakes, however, must never be dis­
pensed with as long as William 
(Robelcy Pfouts and Aulma “Dutch 
Girl” Blessing are on hand. These 
two spent most of the evening 
keeping the waiters busy replenish­
ing the supply of cakes, and when 
the dainties gave out, went home. 
The idea of flannels is inore than 
O. K., but we hope those in at­
tendance at next year’s Senior Ball 
break in their new sport shoes be­
fore the dance.' The squeaks of 
these sartorial necessities often 
drowned out the music, and more 
than, once, Mr. Kay Kayser gaye 
up in despair. Incidentally, the 
music was probably the best' we 
have heard here this . j^car, and

Tartan Obtains News Concerning 
Gandhi And Present India Conditions
EDITOR’S NOTE—
Professor -Kirpatrick of the De­
partment of English has been good 
enough to allow the TARTAN to re­
print the following cxcerps from a 
letter which he received recently 
from Rev. C. Herbert Rice, presi­
dent of the Ewing Christian Col­
lege at Allahabad', India. Allahabad 
has lately been the scene of much 
political importance since it is the 
home of the great Nehru family, and 
after the London Round Table Con­
ference all political personages con­
verged there to discuss various ques­
tions of importance to Indian officials^ 
Also, the city is situated at the con­
fluence of the Ganges and Jumna 
rivers, and hence a very holy place 
to Hindus. The final paragraph 
should prove of particular interest in 
contrasting the Indian College which 
Rev. Rice represents with Carnegie.
Mahatma Gandhi is staying at the 
Nehru mansion, part of which has 
been dedicated by the family to the 
nation as Congress Headquarters, and 
is kno\0n as Swaraj Bhawan. Great 
crowds may be seen at the gates all 
day long striving to get a glimpse 
of their beloved Mahatma. Yester­
day we secured an invitation to be 
present at Gandhi’s evening prayer 
service and to meet Mr. Gandhi 
afterward. At seven he took his 
place on a ljttlc' balcony under the 
stars. Seated about him on the floor 
were the members of the bereaved 
family, the men and women of the 
Congress group, and the eight or nine 
of us American visitors. Devotional 
and patriotic hymns were chanted in 
Hindi, a few quiet words of com­
fort were given by Mr. Gandhi to 
the bereaved widow in mourning, and 
then several of us were invited to 
follow him into his little room near 
by. Mr. Gandhi sat on his mat in 
front of us, enveloped in a white 
home-spun shawl, and greeted us with 
a charm of manner and smile, speak­
ing in low voice and in beautiful 
English. As we sat there with him, 
cross-legged on the floor, we engaged 
in a most interesting personal con­
versation of almost half an hour.
It is difficult in a paragraph to 
sumniarize his answers and opinions 
given in response to our questions. 
We touched very lightly upon politi­
cal issues, particularly as just now 
the Congress group are holding a 
non-committal position awaiting their 
discussion of the Round Table Con­
ference proposals. But on other, mat­
ters he spoke most freely. He dis­
believes entirely in the examination- 
ridden - system of Government cduca-> 
tion now current in India. He wants 
the simplicity of village life to be 
developed and maintained, and ad 
vocatcs an education primarily fitting 
India for that life. “A Ford car 
in each of India’s 700,000 villages 
would ruin India.” When we told 
him that we were engaged in a re-
study of the educational programme 
in India with a view to discovering 
freedom to experiment and to adapt 
the scheme of education to concrete 
'life and need, he said that while 
Christian education was welcomed in 
India he was opposed to its being 
used as a means to conversion. Of 
course “conversion” is anathema to 
Gandhi, who believes that no man 
should desire that another should 
change his religion. When asked 
what special contribution he thought 
Western education might. have for 
India, he said, “Sanitation and clean­
liness ; and using our time to better 
advantage.” “I have no special at­
tachment to hand-spinning,” he said, 
“I would gladly promote any other 
productive occupation which would 
employ the idle hours of the peasant. 
But I am convinced‘that there is no 
other.” He cited American treatment 
of the Negro as a conspicuous ex­
ample of the failure of the West 
to live up to the teaching of the 
Christian religion. And in answer to 
the question as to whence one might 
dc:’ the strength to “Overcome 
evil with good” Gandhi said, "It is 
only from faith in a God severe­
ly just. This I know from personal 
experience.”
Of course we can’not full}’’ agree 
with Mr. Gandhi on many of • these 
points, but all of his opinions are 
worth thinking about, and none of 
them can .be ignored when held with 
such obvious sincerity by India’s 
greatest man.
The -Magh .Mela, greatest Bathing 
Festival of the year in all India 
has just finished. For a month all 
the roads and streets have been con­
stantly traveled by pilgrim proces­
sions. On the greatest day of the 
mela we went with some visiting 
friends, riding on a big elephant 
through the surging‘ crowds to the 
sacred bathing place at the junction 
of the Ganges and Jumna Rivers. 
Official estimate put. the number of 
that sea. of people at over a million. 
Even when pushing on foot through 
the dense crowd at the river bank 
in order to reach our bpat we four 
foreigners met with no suggestion 
of discourtesy or ill feeling. There 
is no carnival spirit in these great 
festival crowds—rather a solemn ip- 
tentncss upon bathing where the two 
streams mingle, and going away with 
a feeling of exultation and satisfac­
tion. They had bathed in and drunk 
of the sacred waters of “Mother 
Ganges” (not just crystal clear where 
hundreds of thousands of people 
keep churning it- up and adding to its 
burden!) They had escaped some of 
the millions of rebirths awaiting 
them ¡ 'they had made'offering-to the 
images of many gods, dread or benign, 
or to the (to us) unspeakable naked 
"Holy man” or fakirs wandering 
through the crowd. They had “gained 
merit.” We saw ^onc pathetic old 
woman shorn of her hair and wail­
ing as she waved a cow’s tail, con-

Elmer Glenn Speaks 
Before Fraternity 
Council
At an informal meeting of the in­
terfraternity council held last* week 
at the Delta Upsilon fraternity house, 
Mr. Elmer Glenn, traveling secretary 
of Delta Upsilon and a member of 
the National Interfratcrnit3r Confer­
ence, spoke on the work of the Na­
tional Conference. Mr. Glenn explain­
ed the parts, workings, and organ­
ization of the Conference, telling of 
its information bureau and its pur­
poses.
The National Intcrfratcrnity Con­
ference draws -its membership from 
most of the national social fraterni­
ties of the country. It holds a meet­
ing each year the Friday following 
Thanksgiving, at which time matters 
concerning national fraternities are 
discussed. It- maintains an informa­
tion bureau which discourages fra­
ternities organized for purposes pro­
moting low ‘ scholarship, and which 
advises fraternities conccrning build­
ing companies and other matters of 
importance.
Next j'ear the Conference, plans to 
have someone talk to all the fra­
ternity undergraduate men on the 
campus.
demned to a six months’ penance 
for having accidentally caused a 
cow’s death. And all this takes place, 
one month each year, just a mile 
down the Jumna River from our 
College campus—as wc have already 
described in a previous letter. What 
amazing contrasts this land and city 
present!
Yesterday the question in confer­
ence was: How many students can. 
you cut off in order to intensify 
your Christian program? Today the 
actual issue is: Can we take more 
students in order to get more fees? 
Yesterday we talked about an in­
creased and more highly qualified 
Christian faculty. Today wc have to 
tell two of our professors who 
possess excellent qualifications that we 
see no immediate possibility of find­
ing the money to continue their 
salary. Yesterday'wc were saying that 
a Christian institution must lead in 
applying scientific studies to the prob­
lems of Indian life. Today we arc 
reminded that wc can not bear the 
cost of the most fundamental sani­
tary lavatory for our students, but 
must continue the semi-public Old 
Testament mctho.ds. Yesterday wc 
were talking about making our Col­
lege known, and keeping the friends 
we’ve got. Today, if this College, 
which has never had a stenographer 
or a telephone, steps out and risks 
the cost, it will have to borrow the 
money. Yesterday wc discussed at 
length the necessity of finding scholar­
ships and stipends so that Christian 
students may be prepared for leader­
ship in the Church and nation. To­
day we have to tell a score of stu­
dents 'wl^o arc applying for needed 
help, that we have not even the 
funds to establish employment 
scholarships for them at $50 each.

Making It Work
and Making It Sell
Time was when you could sell Mr. John Q. Public a 
radio or an automobile merely by showing him that 
it worked. Today he takes that for granted.
Now he must be shown that it works better, looks bet­
ter, is easier to operate than any past or present model; 
Today the all-important element in an article is sales- 
appeal; And the all-important member of the manu­
facturer’s staff is the man who designs this sales-appeal 
into the product—theproduct engineer. He.is the man who 
gave you free-wheeling in your automobile, who made 
it possible for textile mills to use one machine in place 
of several and 'countless other product improvements;
Product engineering is still in its infancy. But like most 
infants, it’s growing fast. Already there are product 
engineers guiding the destinies of most all our impor­
tant plants. And they’re all facing similar, problems in 
thpir work.
Ever alert to new trends in engineering, McGraw-Hill 
was quick to sense this group’s need for a common 
meeting ground. This it provided in the form oi a new 
magazine—Product Engineering. Ask your librarian for 
a copy. You’ll find its pages interesting, no matter what 
field of engineering you intend to enter. Most college 
libraries have McGraw-Hill publications on file.-
Business men, industrialists and engi­
neers— 600,000 of them—regularly read 
the McGraw-Hill Publications. More 
than 3,000,000 use McGraw-Hill books 
and magazines in their business.
