GENEVA DOWNED ALL TRACK MARIEITA PLAYS WESTINGHOUSE
ID EXTRA LINE CANDIDATES OUT HERE TONKiNT WINS POOR CAME
ROUGH GAME ON FOULS, 
SCORE 30 TO 28
KING WINS HIGH JUMP IN THE 
CRAFTON MEET.
Although playing at top speed, the 
Varsity five had to go extra time to 
win from Geneva on Tuesday night, 
January 27. The final score was 30- 
28.
The game, which was played at 
Beaver Falls, was fast and rough, both 
sides exerting themselves from the 
first toss-up. Geneva claimed to be 
crippled by the absence of several 
regulars, but the odds in that re­
spect were evened by the absence of 
our Captain Criswell. Crissy is nurs­
ing a wrenched knee, which will keep 
him out of the game for some time.
The scoring started on foul goals, 
Colvin shooting his first successfully 
and McDanel following suit. Tum- 
pane scored a field goal, giving Tech 
a brief lead, but a few minutes later 
the score was tied at six all. Then 
Carnegie led for an instant at 8 to 6, 
which score was replaced by 9 to 8 
in Geneva’s favor. Tumpane and Col­
vin regained the advantage and went 
ahead 11 to 10. This lead was main­
tained until the end of the half, the 
score standing 17 to 16.
In the second period Geneva start­
ed out for blood, and ran up seven 
points before the Plaid five rallied. 
Tumpane and his feeders got busy 
and soon had the score tied again at
24. This was increased to 28 to 25,
but in the last few minutes Geneva 
scored on a field and a foul goal and 
the score at the end of time was 28 
all. The referee called for an extra
five minutes of play, and Colvin,
scoring two fouls, won the fight.
The Carnegie team showed a great 
improvement in all departments of 
the game, playing together like a 
bunch of professional stars. Henning 
was slightly weak at shooting, as was 
Colvin, but both men were guarded 
closely when within striking distance, 
and had little chance to shoot. Tum­
pane was the bright individual star. 
He completely ran away from his 
guard, and, with the other four play­
ers feeding the ball to him1, he suc­
ceeded in getting nine successful 
shots. Hines played like a fiend. 
His speed and passing contributed to 
the score in many ways, while he 
guarded his man well. In fact, it was 
superior guarding by Hines and Douth- 
ett that gave Carnegie the advantage. 
Colvin outplayed his man easily, and

All of the track candidates are ex­
pected to report by the beginning of 
next week. Many of the conserva­
tive ones, who have waited until the 
examinations should pass their weary 
w^y, will be out for practice Mon­
day, With but five men left from the 
1913 team, several runners must be 
developed,
The Tech men who took part in 
the Crafton meet last Saturday made 
a very creditable showing, especially 
“Jack” King, The latter won the 
championship of the Middle Atlantic 
Association in the high jump event by 
clearing the bar at 5 feet 9 inches. 
He is jumping in better form than 
ever, and gives promise of reaching 
the 6-foot mark later in the season, 
Hemman ran a good race in the 220- 
yard dash, finishing fourth in the fin­
als after placing second in his trial 
heat, He will be a welcome addition 
to the track squad, which is depleted 
by a lack of sprinters. Finley, who 
tried out for the half-mile last spring, 
ran in the quarter-mile handicap 
race, He gained fourth place in his 
heat and qualified for the finals, but 
was unable to place.
At present the team is preparing for 
the indoor meet on February 21. All 
of the candidates are requested to 
report as soon as possible. With 
only tw6 weeks left to train, stiff 
workouts will be in order up to the 
last minute. First Assistant Manager 
Manchester will have charge of the 
Tech entries and hopes to place men 
in all of the events.
A FORGE EXHIBIT.
THISWEEK’S SCHEDULE A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
A very interesting exhibition show­
ing the manufacture of crucible steel 
has been obtained by Mr. Taylor, 
School of Applied Industries, from 
the Colonial Steel Company. Mr. 
Taylor is using the exhibition in his 
lectures to students.
The exhibit consists of a number of 
plates 10x12 inches, showing each op­
eration in the manufacture of steel. 
These are set in a large frame which 
is lighted by an elaborate system of 
wiring, giving the pictures a touch of 
reality. The steam hammers, forging 
the ingots to finished sizes, show up 
unusually well.
Examination week will be inter­
fered with long enough to permit the 
Varsity to meet Marietta in basket­
ball. For a few hours the players 
will be excused from cramming. A 
victory will put them as well as the 
spectators in a happy frame of mind 
and improve their prospects of pass­
ing tomorrow, while a defeat will be 
an ill omen. The game, which will 
begin at 8:15 o’clock, is the last one 
at home for two weeks.
The team will be minus the serv­
ices of Captain Criswell, who wrench­
ed his knee last week in practice. His 
loss will be keenly felt, for what he 
lacks in size he makes up in playing 
ability. Henning or Levy will fill 
Criswell’s position at forward. Both 
of these men have given good ac­
counts of themselves when put in the 
big games, and should develop with 
more experience. The rest of the 
team will remain intact.
The schedule this week is a diffi­
cult one. In addition to the Mari­
etta game, the team will meet Juni- 
atta and Penn State. It will leave to­
morrow for a two-day trip to the cen­
tral part of the state, playing tomor­
row at Huntington and Saturday at 
State College. Tech is particularly 
anxious to get revenge for the close 
defeat at the hands of Juniatta a few 
weeks ago, when the game was lost 
in the last few minutes of play. There 
will be no return engagement with 
State this year, so that a victory over 
the Blue and White combination will 
mean more than usual. Juniatta de­
feated State earlier in the season and 
they just managed to repeat the trick 
agamst us. Meanwhile, State has 
shown improvement by winning from 
Pitt. These comparisons place Tech 
in a favorable light. It is up to the 
team to secure a permanent position 
among the leaders in collegiate bas­
ketball circles of this end of the state. 
The ability is there, a stronger punch 
is needed.
Everybody is boosting the Prom, 
so get in line.
Has that girl been giving you some 
home cooked meals? Better take her 
to the Prom and you’ll get some 
more.
BOTH TEAMS WEAK, WITH 
VARSITY HOLDING MARGIN.
How to get a friend for life? Take 
her to the Prom.
The team that lost to Westing- 
house on Saturday night, January 31, 
at Wilkinsburg was the poorest ag­
gregation that has represented Carne­
gie Tech in the floor game for many 
moons. The score of 16 to 25 does 
not begin to indicate how poor the 
losing team was, for the winners were 
also in a deep, deep hole.
An endless amount of energy was 
wasted in aimless running about the 
floor, when, if a small irrodicum had 
been expended in real basketball, a 
different tale could be told. It would 
be unjust to say that any one player 
was poor, for the truth of the matter 
is that the whole bunch was rotten. 
The lack of mutual confidence that led 
to lack of teamwork could only be 
justified by the fact that each indi­
vidual knew howr poorly he was play­
ing and thought that the others were 
as bad.
Some of the guarding was good, but 
that some was few and far between. 
Passing, shooting, in fact everything 
that goes to make up a game, was 
forgotten, but we must say that there 
were some speedy relay races 
without a goal.
As said before, Westinghouse also 
played poorly. They did some fair 
passing, and that, with mediocre suc­
cess at shooting, won the game for 
them.
The stars were all of the negative 
quality. Everything was in eclipse 
for the evening in a slump that, it is 
hoped, was only temporary. The least 
said about the contest will help make 
it soonest forgotten.

THE HONOR SYSTEM IN THE 
SENIOR CLASS.
At last the Senior Science Clas sis 
on the honor system. Under the new 
regulations of the faculty, each ex­
amination is to be given in two rooms. 
Those students who wish to take the 
examination under a gentleman’s 
agreement report to one room, where 
there will be no faculty supervision; 
those who believe that cheating is 
justifiable if they can “get away” with 
it, will take their examination in a 
separate room, where the instructors 
will probably effectually prevent any 
“getting away” with it. In other 
words, the Seniors, as individuals, 
have the choice of adopting or reject­
ing the honor system, and each man 
is put on his own responsibility.
The feature of this system, as 
first proposed this year which aroused 
opposition was that a student was re­
quired to report to a Student Coun­
cil any other student whom he saw 
cheating. There was no thought on 
the part of the faculty that such a 
case would ever arise; the Senior 
class, on the other hand (or at least a 
few members of it) were seemingly 
afraid to trust the honesty of their 
fellow-classmates, and would not agree 
to the system on account of this 
clause. Under the new plan, even 
this quibble was done away w'ith, for 
there will be no Student Council, and 
no case of cheating will arise, we are 
confident. The student will not even
have to sign after his examination 
paper that he has neither given nor 
received aid; the faculty will take it 
for granted, when a man enters the 
room where the honor system is to 
be used, that he thereby gives his 
word as a gentleman not to act in any 
manner which might be deemed dis­
honorable.
The faculty and Dean of the Science 
School are to be congratulated upon 
the broad-minded, square policy which 
they have adopted in this case, as 
contrasted to the narrow quibbling of 
a few members of the class. We 
know that the plan will meet with 
success, and we hope to see it ex­
tended to the other classes as soon as 
may be consistent with the plans of 
the faculty.
STUDENT GOVERNMENT IN 
ANOTHER SCHOOL.
Some day we hope to see the stu­
dents at Carnegie assume the respon­
sibility of their own government. We 
do not think they are ready for it 
yet; but we believe that in a few years 
they will so develop as a body that 
the faculty will be willing to entrust 
this responsibility to them. The plan 
of the Honor System as recently given 
to the Senior Science Class is a step 
in the right direction.
At the University of Texas, student 
government has met with a great 
deal of success. Read what an op­
timistical student says about it:
“For several reasons, we have just 
cause to be proud of our form of stu­
dent self-government in the Univer­
sity of Texas. We are proud, I should 
say in the first place, because we 
have been the pioneers in this field. 
While the students of other colleges 
were afraid to get out from under 
the protecting wing of the faculty, 
the students of the University of 
Texas were willing to run the hazard 
of walking alone. And from a rather 
small beginning, we have developed 
into a real democracy as a student- 
body. We have not only made our 
progress in self-government safe and 
sure, but we have blazed the way for 
the other student-bodies of other in­
stitutions to follow.”
“WTe are proud for another reason— 
we have succeeded even beyond the 
dreams of the early pioneers. We 
now have a complete honor system, 
which the students themselves rigidly 
enforce. There is no effective appeal 
from a decision rendered under the 
honor system by the Students’ Coun­
cil. And this fact has done more than 
anything else in making the honor 
system justify itself. Moreover, the 
students elect all their officials; and 
.it should be borne in mind that these 
various officials perform all the legis­
lative, executive, and judicial func­
tions of a real government, so far as 
their authority extends in the limited 
sphere of the college community. We 
have even gone so far as to establish 
the initiative and referendum, thus 
making the student will the dominant 
factor of student affairs. None of us, 
save those who are afraid of respon­
sibility, now desires to revert back to
the faculty regulation regime. In­
deed, such an idea has not been seri­
ously proposed; and, if proposed, 
could not enlist substantial support. 
We have taken upon our own shoul­
ders the responsibility of governing 
ourselves; we liKe the task; and it is 
only a question of time until every 
vestige of faculty control will be done 
away with.
“The students have met the respon­
sibility squarely. They have not 
flinched in performing their duty. 
They are proud of their past record; 
but are content to go one step at a 
time, that progress may be sure. To 
assume that the students are grow­
ing tired of running their own affairs, 
is farcical and directly opposed to the 
facts in the case. And those of us 
who are timid in asserting our own 
power should gain inspiration by con­
templating what has already been ac­
complished, and what a fruitful field 
of experimental democracy rests be­
fore us; for we must keep up our rep­
utation as being able to preserve real 
democratic institutions.”
WHAT IS THERE IN COLLEGE 
LIFE?
As the time draws near when col­
lege days will be over, members of 
the Senior Class begin to wonder 
what they have gotten out of their 
four years’ course. Some have spent 
their time wisely, others would get 
a great deal more out of their course 
and have fewer regrets if they had 
the opportunity to take it over again. 
But this opportunity they do not 
have. Whatever they have learned, 
much or little, whether from books 
or from association with fellow-men, 
they must be content. So it behooves 
the Freshman entering college to con­
sider wisely and well what his pur­
pose is in coming to college, whether 
he wants to get something worth 
while out of his career here, whether 
he will be satisfied with merely a 
mental training and no other broaden­
ing influences, or whether he is pur­
posed to go out into the world with 
a big broad training which will en­
able him to attack life’s problems. 
The following from one of our con­
temporaries is to the point:
“The Freshman has been asking 
himself as he begins his college life 
‘What will I get out of it?’ The Se­
nior, ‘What have I gotten?’ The an­
swer in both cases depends on what 
each individual deems worth while. 
One man wants a mental training, 
another vocational preparation, 
another culture. Perchance some 
come merely to gain the social ad­
vantages and to enjoy the pleasures 
of college associations. Whatever the 
purpose, the result is governed there­
by.
But what benefit is mental training 
except as a means of broadening the 
mind and giving a new conception of 
life? vocational training is not an 
end in itself uut a means to do an in­
dividual share of the work of the 
world. Earning a livelihood, as such, 
is only a means of gaining the deepe:

WHAT’S WHAT AND HOW
NOISE
You know that clever definition of 
life that is not a part of Sunday 
school literature? Well, suppose we 
substitute the word “noise” for the 
word “thing” and cancel the naughty 
adjective that smells like something 
burning; or, better still, to keep it 
real snappy, let us replace the horrid 
word by its denatured form, adapted 
to the emergency use of clergymen 
and practicing church members when 
oeeved. This is the result: “Life is
just one darned noise after another.”
We never realize how much this 
protean and somewhat intangible 
thing which we call environment when 
we are trying to make an impression 
of profound sociological wisdom is 
made up of mere sounds, until those 
sounds are eliminated. Anyone, es­
pecially a tenderfoot who has camped 
in the “wilds,” where it is so aggress­
ively silent that the beating of his 
heart sounds like a series of explo­
sions, and he yearns for any old noise 
even that of the matutinal alarm clock, 
begins to realize how much of his ex­
perience is just noise.
Genius has been defined as an “in­
finite capacity for taking pains.” Re­
puted genius may be too often defined 
as a turbulent source of sound. Any­
one with enough effrontery and three 
inches of chest expansion can convince 
75 per cent of the “peepul” that any 
old tomfool proposition is divine rev­
elation.
The whole vocal plant of the aver­
age “silver-tongued” orator would 
not assay enough precious metal to 
plate a needle point, but it could give 
a spirometer the shock of its career. 
Did you ever notice that the noise 
made by a debater is in inverse ratio 
to the arguments he has in stock. 
Also that the expert liar always uses 
the loud pedal? Even religion means 
to some a robust line of assorted 
yells.
By the same token, did you ever 
see two otherwise sane human beings, 
ignorant of each other’s tongue, at­
tempting conversation? It beats the 
“world’s series” for noise, and looks 
like incipient assassination.
Think of the important role sound
has played in your experience here at 
Tech, from the moans of your in­
structor at some original contribution 
to learning on your part to the riot 
at the basketball game.
You may remember that day when 
as a tenderfoot Plebe you sat in 
mathematical durance vile, frantically 
pursuing an agile cosine through the 
labyrinth of a log table and a silence 
in the room like that following an ef­
fort to borrow a “fiver” from your 
best friend. Suddenly, just outside 
the door in the echoing corridor, a 
volcano of alien parts of speech let 
go. Apparently a foreign dictionary 
had exploded, and the jabbering 
swelled in volume until you had ec­
static visions of a personal encounter 
with a sudden decrease in the immi­
grant population. And then, alas, 
the pyrotechnics dwindled to an oc­
casional splutter of a futile adjective 
that had missed fire,
You discovered afterward, you 
know that the panitors had merely left 
over massaging the floor and had 
caucused outside your prison to de­
cide whose turn it was to joy-ride 
the scrub bucket, chaperoned by the 
mop, to the sub-basement and back in 
the elevator.
-rtgain, if you were compelled to in­
fest the class rooms at the East End 
of the second floor corridor, adjacent 
to the shrine of pugnacious odors, the 
hours between 9 and 12 were dedicated 
to amateur surgery upon the caskets 
of deceased chemicals always lying 
in state before their mausoleums, 
known as the chemical lab. It always 
suggested that the obsequies had been 
postponed rather too long.
When the faculty indulges in the 
nocturnal extravagance of a night­
mare (about the only means of con­
veyance accessible to them) it is usu­
ally compounded of vociferous ham­
mer, saw, automatic riveter, shrieking 
sawed-off locomotives and “Pennsyl­
vania Dutch.”
It all takes the shrinking nerves one 
by one, drags them' out of their con­
cealment and ties fancy knots in them, 
but if the ever present racket were 
suddenly stilled, we would miss it. 
Oh, yes, we would miss it sorely.

side of life. In taking this training, 
then, we must keep in mind that it is 
not the fundamental thing in life but 
merely a means of making life broader 
and more worth while. Life loses all 
its attractiveness unless we think of it 
as the preparation for some existence 
bigger and better ana broader. Even 
such a conception lacks something. 
Man’s supreme end is to serve his 
fellow man and thereby to glorify 
God. Any purpose short of this 
makes man’s existence a mere empty 
farce, a very paradox in which there 
is neither reason nor sense. All activ­
ity, all thought, all expenditure of en­
ergy must serve this purpose or it is 
vanity.
“Let the college man realize this su­
preme purpose in life and he will find 
college activities take new relations to 
one another in his mind. The relative 
importance of his different duties and 
diversions will assume a new aspect. 
Let the college man learn to put first 
things first!
“Man is physical, mental, social and 
spiritual in his make-up. The ideal 
man has developed these each as the 
complement of the others. Without 
any one he is incomplete. With any 
over-developed he is not the balanced 
man, and narrow-mindedness is the 
result. Think about this!”

The Plebe Basketball team played 
its first game January 26 at 3 p. m., 
in the gymnasium with the Sopho­
more team and were defeated by that 
team with the score 12-5. It was a 
very interesting game, as is shown by 
the fact that at the end of the firs 
half the score was a tie—4-4. The
lineup was:
Sophs—12. Plebes—5.

ALUMNAE DANCE.
The M. M. C. S. Alumnae Associa­
tion gave a dance Friday night, Janu­
ary 30, in the school gymnasium, which 
was pronounced a big success. The 
dancing started at 8:30 and lasted until 
one, the music being furnished by the 
Wallace Orchestra.
The committee in charge consisted 
of the Misses J. L. Caldwell, H. A. 
Andersen, L. B. Greene, and E. T.

the building on Friday evening, Feb­
ruary 6, at 8:00 o’clock.
It has been decided that the “Tango” 
and “ragging” will not be permitted 
on this occasion.
The school of mines at Columbia,

COLLEGE NOTES.
Soccer is gaining popularity in La­
fayette every day. It is not supported 
by the Athletic Association thus far, 
and all coaching is done by students 
who have played the game before.
In Texas they have a coach for 
Soccer and the game is so popular 
that the “Daily Texan” is able to give 
out the “dope” on players and posi­
tions.
Congressman Fess of Ohio has in­
troduced a bill to establish a National 
University of the United States at 
Washington, D. C., with an initial 
appropriation of $500,000. Its objects 
would be to advance science and the 
fine arts, to train men and women for 
posts of responsibility in public and 
private service, to co-operate with the 
government's scientific bureaus and to 
work in conjunction with public and 
private institutions of learning in the 
country.—The Pennsylvanian.

perience as journalists.
Fifty-five per cent of the faculty 
and Senior Class of Princeton Univer­
sity are opposed to hazing Freshmen. 
Their stand is that class democracy, 
unity and status are Denefits of sys­

general participation in hazing in the 
last few years, and the failure to enter 
into it with spontaneous enthusiasm 
is noticed perceptibly.
A general -elief in class rushes and 
other restrictions is liable to do away 
with the other custom entirely.—Penn­

MEMBER OF FACULTY WRITES
Review of Article by Mr. C. W. 
Sprowl on Cams.
In the “American Machinist” of Oc­
tober 25 there occurred an article on 
the designing of cams, written by C. 
W. Sprowl, of the Department of 
Machine Design. This should be of 
much interest to the engineering and 
industrial students at Tech, especially 
those taking a mechanical course.
In this article various methods for 
designing cams are discussed, with il­
lustrations, example problems and 
analyzations. The reason is given for 
the jerky motion produced by a cam 
whose outline is drawn tangent to the 
roll positions in such a manner that 
the points of tangency are not coin­
cident with the points where radial 
lines, drawn through the roll centers, 
cross the cam outline. The harmonic 
method is described as better to de­
velop a cam to give smooth, uniform 
motion.
After explaining a simple cam 
mechanism with diagrams and anal­
yzations, Mr. Sprowl defines the pur­
pose of designing cams as to so con­
struct the outline that the laws of 
physics are not violated. The bad 
name cam's have in the mechanical 
world, especially when operating at 
high speed, i. e. greater than 150 R. P. 
M., is almost entirely due to faulty 
design. A properly designed cam will 
run very quietly, indeed, even at high 
speed.
In explaining the various methods 
of design the constant velocity method 
in which the cam theoretically moves 
at the same speed through the speci­
fied distance, is dismissed at once as 
impracticable, on account of the very 
great, theoretically infinite, force 
needed to operate the mechanism at 
the start of a rise of the cam rod.
The harmonic method of design, 
where the movement of the rod cor­
responds to that of a pendulum, is 
next taken up and thoroughly dis­
cussed. This cam is quite satisfact­
ory at ordinary speeds.
The most nearly perfect method, 
that of uniform acceleration, is last 
treated. Here, by the simple phys­
ical relation S — j4 at 2 and the require­
ments the cam must fulfill, the data 
for the design is obtained. Since the 
acceleration, and therefore the force, 
is constant at all times by this method 
uniform pressure, compression and de­
flection of the cam rod is maintained. 
“Without doubt, cams designed to 
produce uniform acceleration and re­
tardation give the best results in prac­
tice,” says Mr. Sprowl in conclu­
sion.
It is one thing to gain experience, 
but quite another thing to profit by it.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and 
removes permanently the dirt, per­
spiration, odor and grime. See Shu­

INDUSTRIAL INDOOR BASE­
BALL TEAM.
The Senior Class of the Industrial 
School have decided to enter a team 
in the Indoor Baseball League and 
have elected J. R. Price manager.
It would b;: a good idea if each 
class would do likewise, or, if that 
be impossible, get together the talent 
of each team and call it the Industrial 
Team. We want to have a team in 
the league, so watch the bulletin 
board for further information.
SWIMMING PARTY FOR INDUS­
TRIES; ALSO AN AQUATIC 
TEAM.
The prospect of an Industrial Swim­
ming Team and even a Polo Team 
look good. President Parker of ;!ie 
Plebes is very enthusiastic about b “ li 
and has made arrangements with tne 
Oakland Na^atorium for the use of 
the pool free of charge. This is a big 
factor in the developing of a team, 
and hence if enough become inter­
ested, an Aquatic Club will be or­
ganized. The swimming party wiU 
be the beginning and should be at­
tended by those interested in a club. 
It is the idea to get a line or. the 
material for Such a team. The date 
of the party wi>' be announce-'1. laie1*.

SEAL HUNTING
In Ye Ancient Colony of Newfound­
land.
EDITOR’S NOTE: Mr. Taylor
has kindly consented to furnish us 
with a most interesting and instructive 
description of his experiences on an 
Arctic trip some years ago. We will 
publish his story in several install­
ments.
That old saying “truth is stranger 
than fiction” is never fully exempli­
fied save when something out of the 
ordinary is brought to one’s atten­
tion, and the following account of 
hunting seal, walrus and Polar bear 
among the northern ice floes may 
prove the above statement to be true. 
Owing to a severe attack of typhoid, 
contracted in Pittsburgh some years 
ago, it was necessary for me to re­
turn home in order to fully recuper­
ate, and, having done so, I deter­
mined if possible to get out to the 
icefields. When, one day, much to 
my surprise, I received a letter from 
an old friend and chief engineer of 
one of the fleet, offering me the posi­
tion as fourth assistant engineer in 
his watch. This was indeed good for­
tune, and I hastened to wire my ac­
ceptance.
It is now the first of March, 1906, 
and all is bustle. The folks are get­
ting my kit ready, for we have to sign 
articles and join the ship March 6. 
At last all is in readiness, the ex­
pressman is at the door and the jour­
ney to the city of St. Johns is begun. 
Lots of company today, for many 
crews are also traveling to join their 
respective ships, and Detore the jour­
ney is finished many will be the tales 
told and old sea songs roared in 
chorus by those sons of the sea. At 
length the ship is reached, articles 
signed, berths fitted up and made 
comfortable, for we are to sail on 
the morrow for a more northern port, 
and thus lessen the danger of being 
frozen in over night.
Let us get acquainted with the ship 
and also the ship’s company that is to 
carry us among the floes of the North 
Atlantic. We know ships as stout 
which have gone on similar cruises 
and have never made port. I dis­
tinctly remember, wThen a boy, of the 
“Lion” leaving for a northern port 
with full crew and never leaving the 
slightest trace of her mysterious dis­
appearance, which happend on a clear 
moonlight night. Men versed in the 
ways of the sea and this particular un­
dertaking w'hispered: “Ship’s company 
all drunk. Boilers dry. Ship blown 
apart and sank to bottom.”
The bow of the sealing ship is 
worthy of examination, and the inge­
nuity of the shipwright is here dis­
played in producing great strength. 
Within, the bow is braced with strong 
timbers. Without, over the 4-inch 
frame of oak, copper fastened, is laid
2-inch green-heart (called the steel 
of woods). About four feet above 
and below the water line, and cover­
ing that are 1-inch plates of steel to
withstand the terrific impact while 
forcing our way through ice fields av­
eraging five feet—that is the level 
field; rough ice would measure ten 
feet, and I have often watched large 
pieces fall on the “barricade” when 
butting our way through from lake to 
lake. Lakes, as the name suggests, 
form at intervals, say half a mile 
apart, and may continue many miles. 
These are useful (for full speed ahead 
is made across these lakes) to butt 
the ice opposite to the next lake. It 
is a fine sight—when butting ice, 
large pieces break off with the impact 
and the weight of the ship presses 
the pieces down edgewise and as a 
result fhe pieces toweV above the 
bulwarks and the beautiful bluish- 
white tinge has a hypnotizing effect 
and also gives a spice of danger.
Erected on deck in the bows of the 
ship are “gallows” upon which are 
lashed strongly built boats to be used 
later on by the gunners potting “old 
hoods” in the scattered ice. In be­
tween the boats are stored large 
quantities of steel gaffs, fastened to a 
spruce sapling eight feet long and 
used by the hunter to knock the seal 
unconscious before removing the pelt, 
and to pull floating pans of ice a con­
venient distance in order to cross open 
water. Hanging over the boats are 
lengths of one-half-inch Manila rope 
upon which many of the crew ire 
busy “whipping” the end to prevent 
ravel and splicing an eye in the oppo­
site end. This “tow rope,” neatly 
coiled, is carried by each hunter i‘i 
addition to the gaff, and used for 
towing pelts to the ship, or in case 
of a blizzard, is stretched with others 
so as to prevent the men from get­
ting lost, for it must be remembered 
the crews are often 20 miles from the 
ship on the open floe.
Glancing aloft, we see a long, bar­
rel-like object fastened to the very 
top of the “mizzen,” and sometimes 
on the foretop as well. Into this a 
quartermaster clambered and scans 
the horizon with a powerful telescope 
for signs of life, and with zero weather 
and strong wind the “crow’s nest” is 
not a bed of roses, even when the 
watch is relieved every two hours.
(To be continued.)

GRAND.
Vaudeville is hitting the high spots 
at the Grand Opera House just now. 
Next week we are to have Aleska 
Suratt, the statuesque and stunning 
star of “The Kiss Waltz,” and her as­
sociate players in “Black Crape and 
Diamonds,” a fantasy of the tender 
passion by George Baldwin. Miss 
Surratt is that titian-haired young 
woman who visualized Charles Dana 
Gibson’s type of American girl in “The 
Bell of Mayfair,” as note for her mag­
nificent gowning as for her acting.
There is another remarkable girl 
in the program for the forthcoming 
week—a girl renowned in quite a dif­
ferent way. She is Bird Millman, the 
scintillating firefly of the high wire, 
whose personal beauty and steel nerve, 
amazing agility and youthful grace are 
exemplified in a series of dancing 
movements on a slender strang of 
swaying steel.
THE ALVIN.
Unusual scenic magnificence, girls 
prettier and more gorgeously gowned 
than in any preceding Winter Garden 
attraction, and a cast of singers, danc­
ers and comedians who are sure to be­
come local favorites are the big fea­
tures of “The Passing Show of 1913,” 
which opens a week’s engagement at 
the Alvin Monday. From the first 
scene in the brief prologue, showing 
the tired business man seeking relaxa­
tion from the cares of everyday life, 
to the final picture in the Oriental suf- 
fraget harem, the fun waxes fast and 
furious, the scenes change with be­
wildering rapidity and the costuming 
flashes before one in tints and shades 
and coloring that fairly dazzles the 
eye. The travesties on the hits of the 
past season, always a feature of the 
Winter Garden productions, are the 
kind which provide innumerable 
laughs.

P. LUDEBUEHL & SON
PENN AND FRANKSTOWN AVENUE, EAST END.
We are now REBUILDING and when completed we 
will have one of the most complete and modern exclusive 
SHOE STORES in Greater Pittsburgh.
Oar business continued while rebuilding, NEW FALL 
BOOTS are arriving daily.
WE’VE FITTED FEET OVER FORTY YEARS.
THE 750 HORSE POWER STEAM 
ENGINE IN THE POWER 
HOUSE.
When the plans were prepared for 
additions to Machinery Hall, the 
Woman’s School, the Applied Design 
Building and the Administration 
Building, the question of greater co- 
pacity of the power house had to be 
considered. First, a steam turbine 
was thought of, but guarantees from 
the foremost steam turbine builders 
ranged from 33 to 48 pounds of steam 
per K. W. hour, which shows that the 
¿team turbine, for noncondensing 
operation in turbines of medium size 
and for production of direct current 
is not equal to the steam engine. The 
Ball engine which has been in the 
power [Aunt of the Institute for the 
last five and a half years uses be­
tween 28 and 29 pounds of steam per 
K. W. hour.
Since a steam engine escapes trou­
bles that would arise from high speed 
gearing or high speed commutators, 
bids were asked from three engine 
builders for an engine of the direct 
flow or “Inflow” type, which type was 
invented by Mr. J. Stumpf, Prof of 
Steam Engineering of the Royal In­
stitute of Technology at Charlotten- 
burg-Berlin, Germany. When the 
bids were received, that of the Mesta 
Machine Company was found to be 
the lowest in price and in guaranteed 
steam consumption, namely 27 pounds 
per K. W. hour. The other two buil 1- 
ers proposed the regular Stumpf type, 
which has no exhaust valves, but has 
instead a set ct exhaust ports in the 
center of the cylinder. While this 
type is very weP. suited for conuens- 
ing operation, ;t is not so well adapt­
ed to mr-condensing operation; ibit 
is to say for conditions as they exi^t 
at Carnegie Tech, because it requires 
excessive clearance spaces and an ex­
cessively large cylinder.
For this reason the bid of the Mesta 
Machine Company was accepted and 
the engine was delievered early in 
1913.
Starting of the engine was delayed 
by the torn-up condition of the power 
plant, falling bricks and planki being 
a daily occurrence. When it was fin­
ally started some surprises appeared. 
The valve gear which follows the 
type built regitlaily by the Mos’a Ma­
chine Company worked quite jnsatis- 
fact jrily. On account of the very 
short cut-off with which the direct 
flow type of engine regularly works, 
the pressure disappears so quickly in 
the cylinder that the valve becomes 
unbalanced before the force of the 
vacuum pot has time to move ir 
through its travel. This results in 
the valve gearing striking hard blows 
against the parts connected with the 
valve. Larger and more effective 
vacuum pots were installed, but after 
the engine had furnished power for 
the exhibition night of the school ir 
was found that the piston had worn 
itself and the cylinder considerably. 
Careful study of the condition showed 
that the piston as originally designed
was unbalanced. To overcome this 
trouble a new type of piston and a 
new cylinder bushing were made.
A new and stronger rear cylinder 
head was also furnished to make 
doubly sure that no injurious defor­
mation could occur in the valve seats.
Nothing was done toward starting 
the engine during the summer, for the 
steam plant of Carnegie Tech is regu­
larly shut down during the summer 
months, and power is furnished by 
the gas engines.
When the steam plant started up 
again in October there was not load 
enough co test out the engine to its 
capacity. It was not until Christmas 
that a rheostaat was provided for 
loading the engine, the work of plac­
ing the rheostaat in commission be­
ing done by an erector of the build­
ers of the engine. While the engine 
furnished power for the schools dur­
ing November and December, it was 
quit'i noisy, and it developed that the 
quick passing of the piston over the 
exhaust ports slams the valves against 
their seats. Shoes were then pro­
vided which hold the valves on their 
seats f ontinuousi5.
In December the Mesta Machine ¦ 
Company requestel the Carnegie In­
stitute to run the engine regularly.
II was arranged that as a matter cf 
precaution the interior of the cylin­
der should be inspected before en­
gineers of the Institute would under­
take operation of the engine. To the 
greatest surprise of everybody it was 
found +:iat the cylinder had been 
s'ightly cut, due to steam blowing 
through a split in the piston rings 
for which no brass keeper had been 
prov’ded, on the basis that b.*as3 is 
net a suitable m2teri.1l for use wish 
sapcrlu iittc' stwn. Hence it was 
necessary to make and install the so- 
•.alle 1 Ditquesne type cf piston r;ng, 
which is perfectly seal.vl and prevents 
leakage of steam without a keeper.
Since early in January the engine 
has been in regular operation 01: the 
school load practically every day, 
picking up the load at about 10:30 ;n 
the morning and carrying it untii 10 
at night. From 7 until 10:30 in -"he 
morning and from 10 until closing 
time at night the load is much tro 
light irr so large an engine and is 
carried by the Ball engine.
A test which was run on the Mesta 
engine indicated that the steam con­
sumption is below the guarantee, that 
is to say, less than 27 pounds per K. 
W. houi, co that the steam economy 
is better than the guarantee called for.
Carnegie Tech is the first technical 
institution in the world to have an en­
gine of the direct flow type and has 
by its adoption gi\i.ii testimony to 
the progressive spirit prevailing within 
it. The t.oubies which attended ihe 
early operation of the engine were not 
wholly unexpected, since any depart­
ure from existing practice, in spite of 
most careful study, usually requires 
some experimenting. The fact that 
the engine is still capable of improve­
ment is due to the conservativeness cf 
the builders, who felt that the C :> ’iss
advertising in the Tartan as
valve gear which had been so ¿"jeeess- 
fully used by them and other engine 
builders in this country should by all 
means be retained for this engine.
In connection herewith it may be 
of interest to know that the two other 
builders of direct flow engines in this 
country have also retained the Corliss 
valve gear. All three concerns now 
realize that for this type of engine 
the non-releasing poppet valve gear is 
the most suitable.
Professor Trinks will study direct 
flow engines and their valve gears at 
their source (Germany) during the 
coming summer, and it is quite pos­
sible that after his return the engine 
may be remodeled by the Mesta Ma­
chine Company for the purpose of 
making it not only an economical en­
gine (which it now is) but also a 
practically noiseless engine.
SENIOR SCIENCE SMOKER.
This brilliant and exclusive function 
was pulled off at the Hotel Schenley, 
Friday evening, January 30. The even­
ing was spent in singing, eating, and 
listening to droll stories. Mr. Routh, 
who had charge of the arrangements, 
certainly is some arranger, and those 
who missed the affair in order to study 
for exams have something to regret.
Remember, no flowers at the Prom 
this year. Another reason for going.
TUITION RAISED AT YALE.
At a meeting of the Yale Corpora­
tion it was decided to raise the tuition 
in the college, the Sheffield-Scientific 
School, and the Graduate School. The 
plan will go into effect for students 
entering in 1914 and thereafter. The 
tuition in the college will be $160 in­
stead of $155, and in the Scientific 
School it is raised from $150 to $180.
It costs you big, large dollars to 
go to school. It will only mean a few 
extra ones to go to the Prom.

SAFETY ON STREET CARS.
An enterprising maker of sundries 
used by street car companies has just 
adopted the idea of the automobile 
world in using a mirror to show what 
is going on to the rear. He proposes 
that the motorman shall have a good 
view of all the people who are board­
ing and alighting from his car, and has 
fashioned a mirror that will do this 
without the necessity of the motorman 
turning his head.
Another invention to promote safe­
ty in handling passengers on street 
cars is an automatic lamp that flashes 
when the conductor closes the door of 
a pay-as-you-enter car. This lamp is
connected with the door of the car, 
and the motorman always gets his 
signal only after the door is closed, 
so that 110 one can be thrown while 
in the act of alighting or boarding the 
car, because the motorman starts too 
soon.
Still another new thing in the street 
car world is a sleeve that makes old 
trolley poles as good as new. The 
poles usually decay first at the top 
of the ground and break off there. 
Xow, by use of the trolley pole sleeve, 
as soon as the signs of decay set in 
the trouble is arrested by driving the 
sleeve down around it—the sleeve 
being built in two interlocking sec­
tions. The consumption of timber in 
the United States for telephone, tele­
graph and trolley poles is no mean 
item, and the new sleeve promises to 
be an aid to the conservation cause.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi­
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom' 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re­
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.
