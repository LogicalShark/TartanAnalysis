Red Team falls to its own offspring
Former CMU professor and students overtake Red Team for Stanford
by Radha Chitale
Science & Technology Editor
Carnegie Mellon’s Red Team and Red Team Too au­
tonomous vehicles crossed the finish line in a historic 
race on Saturday with times of 7:04:50 and 7:17:00, 
one right after the other. The two Humvees finished 
just behind the Stanford Racing Team, which had the 
fastest time, clocking in at 6:53:58.
“Sometimes it’s the performance, sometimes it’s 
the quality, sometimes it’s raw speed. Sandstorm and 
Hllander did superbly in all,” said William “Red” 
Whittaker, CMU’s Red Team leader.
Though Whittaker refrained from naming teams, 
the real surprise of the pack was Stanford, which en­
tered Stanley, a Volkswagen Touareg. Averaging 19.1 
mph, Stanford gained the lead just before the third-to- 
last obstacle of the course.
The Stanford team, ironically, has many CMU con­
nections: Team leader Sebastian Thrun is a former 
computer science professor at CMU. Several CMU 
grads, including Michael Montemerlo, a former Ph.D. 
student under Whittaker, are on the team as well.
“There are plenty of my students and our [CMU] 
grads that are part of the culture and in lots of these 
teams,” Whittaker said. “In a lot of ways, no matter 
who wins, I win.”
Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Proj­
ect Agency (DARPA), the Grand Challenge sought to 
bring together the brightest minds to create the first 
fully autonomous vehicles that could cross miles of 
off-road terrain successfully. The first challenge in 
took place in the Mojave Desert in 2004, with disap­
pointing results. None of the teams finished the race, 
though CMU’s entry, Sandstorm, traveled the farthest: 
7.36 miles.
This year saw CMU return a veteran, entering Red 
Team with Sandstorm, and a second team, Red Team 
Too, with Hllander. “This isn’t CMU’s first rodeo,” 
Whittaker said. “We are in the robot business, period.”
Carnegie Mellon was the only organization to submit 
two entries in the Grand Challenge. They were two 
among 195 total entrants from 36 states and five coun­
tries vying for 20 spots on the start line on race day.
Carnegie Mellon’s vehicles performed exception­
ally, with one-of-a-kind hardware and technology. 
Red Team’s Sandstorm is a triumph of reinvention. 
The 1986 Model 998 HMMWV (High Mobility Multi­
purpose Wheeled Vehicle) “is a 20-year-old junker 
that [Whittaker] bought from a farmer.” Red Team 
Too’s Hllander represents the “latest, greatest, and 
also commercial technology. It has all the bells and 
whistles you expect in a real hot truck or a real hot off- 
road machine,” Whittaker said.
While there is an extensive amount of attention to 
hardware, “[the] most powerful technology is pre­
planning the curves in the hours or so before the race 
when the route is revealed,” Whittaker said. “We com­
pute the terrain and the details of where we’re going

CAUSE compiles black oral history
by Shawn Wertz
Junior Staffwriter
The home of jazz legends such 
as pianist Earl Hines and vocalist 
Lena Horne, as well as photog­
rapher Teeny Harris and play­
wright August Wilson, Pittsburgh 
has long been a strong matrix of 
African-American culture. Soon, 
that culture will be recorded for 
future generations. The com­
mencement of an oral history 
project to record the experiences 
of African-Americans in Pitts­
burgh was announced in a press 
release on October 3 to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus.
The project will be led by the 
Center for Africanamerican Ur­
ban Studies and the Economy
(CAUSE) within CMU’s depart­
ment of history. Its goal is to 
document the African-American 
experience in post-World-War-II 
Pittsburgh by collecting and pre­
serving the oral histories of the 
city’s African-American residents 
after the war.
The oral history project will be 
CAUSE’S first major research proj­
ect on Pittsburgh, but CAUSE has 
supported similar research proj­
ects, including a comparison of 
poverty rates between the Pitts­
burgh and Detroit metropolitan 
areas.
“Many of the people are now 
senior citizens,” said Joe Trotter, a 
history professor and the director 
of CAUSE. “We want to capture 
some of the history that’s in dan­
ger of disappearing.”
The project is set to unfold 
over the course of several years, 
primarily so that CAUSE will be 
able to document the many dif­
ferent ways in which the city’s Af- 
rican-American citizens have kept 
black culture alive and thriving in 
Pittsburgh.
“What’s great about Pittsburgh 
is that there are, and have been for 
quite some time, a lot of African- 
American arts organizations,” 
commented Heather Clark, the 
Director of Marketing & Commu­
nications of the African-American 
Cultural Center, which is sched­
uled to open in November 2007.
Pittsburgh also serves as an 
important backdrop for CAUSE’S 
study because of the way the city

The death of native 
playwright August Wilson 
at the age of 60 came on 
October 2, just as plans were 
set to honor the native of 
Pittsburgh with the renaming 
of the Virginia Theatre in 
Manhattan to the August 
Wilson Theater.
Diagnosed with liver cancer 
in May, Wilson learned it was 
inoperable only one month 
later. “I’ve lived a blessed 
life. I’m ready,” he told the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “At 
a certain age, you should be 
prepared to go at any time.”

RIAA returns 
to campus
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
For the second time in a year, 
Carnegie Mellon students are 
facing subpoenas from the 
Recording Industry Association 
of America (RIAA) for illegally 
sharing copyrighted files. Last 
week, the RIAA issued Computing 
Services notice of an “intent to 
subpoena” an unknown number 
of students who have been caught 
sharing files illegally on i2Hub.
According to Joel Smith, vice 
provost and chief information 
officer for Computing Services, 
the RIAA notified Computing 
Services of illegal file sharing 
on the network this past week. 
Since Computing Services acts as 
an Internet service provider, the 
RIAA notified them and provided 
information about specific ma­
chines on the network that have 
been engaging in illegal file shar­
ing.
Under the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act passed by Congress 
in 1998, Computing Services is 
obligated to respond and iden­
tify which individuals are reg­
istered to the computers. While 
the University will not be subpoe­
naed, the RIAA issues individual 
subpoenas based on the amount 
of illegal information shared.
Computing Services has the op­
tion of notifying students of the 
RIAA’s intent to subpoena. Smith 
says Computing Service warns ev­
ery student that a subpoena may 
be coming to their mailbox.
According to Smith, the wave 
of subpoenas is part of a plan of 
the RIAA to curtail illegal sharing 
on Internet2, a private alterna­
tive network providing electronic 
access to 207 primary research 
universities, including Carnegie 
Mellon, i2hub, file-sharing soft­
ware that uses Internet2, is the 
most common source of illegal 
sharing for students.
“A lot of high-quality [Internet] 
service at CMU is because of 
Internet2,” said Smith. Internet2, 
which allows students to down­
load at speeds higher than even 
most high-speed networks, is an 
attractive option for students to 
download music. *

Vaccines in full supply as the flu season begins
by Matthew McKee
Staffwriter
Headaches may not result 
merely from stress this time of 
year. With cooler weather de­
scending upon campus, a new 
round of the flu may make stu­
dent lives more troublesome. 
Now, headaches could signal an 
attack more damaging to college 
life than pressure from school- 
work.
Last year’s flu season provided 
a glimpse into the effects of medi­
cal errors. The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) discovered 
that the Chiron Corporation in 
Liverpool, which was to supply 
more than half the U.S.’s doses 
of the flu vaccine, almost sent 
contaminated doses across the 
Atlantic. The results of the FDA’s 
inspections soon made medical
clinics across the U.S. realize that 
a huge shortage of the vaccine 
would ensue.
As the U.S. uses tens of mil­
Jimi Okelana/Art Staff
lions of vaccinations yearly, this 
presented an enormous problem 
to distributors of the medicine. 
Clinics began providing the shot 
to only those with a 
high chance of catch­
ing the virus, and mil­
lions of Americans had 
to weather the winter 
without protection. In 
September, the Cen­
ters for Disease Con­
trol and Prevention 
(CDC) estimated that 
about 200,000 people 
are hospitalized for flu 
complications yearly 
in the U.S.
However, the CDC 
reports no major 
shortages this year, 
and the FDA has thor­
oughly inspected the 
Chiron Corporation 
for contamination in
its supply of vaccines. With an 
estimated demand of 60 million 
vaccines, doctors around the 
country plan to give priority to 
those patients they deem most at 
risk. The CDC has recommended 
that doctors follow such a plan 
and allow the general population 
to be vaccinated after October 24. 
In an e-mail to Morewood Gar­
dens residents, housefellow Brian 
Curfman expressed the need to 
allow those more susceptible to 
the disease first chance at the vac­
cine.
At Carnegie Mellon, students 
will have easy access to the vac­
cine. Diane Dawson, a registered 
nurse at CMU Health Services, 
said that a shortage was not ex­
pected. “In fact, I’m surprised 
that we’re on any waiting list at 
all for vaccinations,” she said. She

'Relay’goes independent
by Andrew Peters
Junior Staffwriter
Late Saturday night, Gesling 
Stadium was surprisingly full of 
life. From eight in the evening on 
Saturday until eight in the morn­
ing on Sunday, 38 teams took to 
the stadium’s track to support 
the American Cancer Society’s 
(ACS) fight against cancer.
This year’s CMU Relay for Life 
event raised over $20,000 for the 
ACS, which is more than double 
what the event made last year. 
Last year’s Relay was CMU’s first 
and was sponsored by Alpha Phi 
Omega, a community service 
fraternity based at CMU.
This year, however, the fra­
ternity chose to turn the event’s 
leadership over to a independent 
Relay for Life committee. The
Relay committee spent the past 
year planning and executing 
Saturday’s event, which, despite 
the chill weather, came off with­
out any major problems.
The ceremonial first lap around 
the stadium track brought hun­
dreds of community members 
together to support those who 
continue to fight cancer and 
to remember and honor those 
who have passed away. In addi­
tion to the first lap, the opening 
luminary ceremony featured 
the singing of “Amazing Grace” 
by CMU senior and voice major 
David Murray.
Participants included ten local 
cancer survivors, over a dozen 
families affected by cancer, and 
numerous student organiza­
tions from both CMU and the

Privilege
Bradford L. Yankiver
I am very proud to announce that 
The Tartan has been selected as one ol 
58 finalists for the 2004-2005 News­
paper Pacemaker award, co-sponsored 
by the Associated Collegiate Press and 
the Newspaper Association of America 
Foundation. More than 200 newspa­
pers entered the competition. The judg­
ing for this prestigious award is based 
on coverage and content, quality ol 
writing and reporting, leadership or 
the opinion page, evidence of in-depth 
reporting, design, photography, art. 
and graphics.
Over the past year, the entire stafl 
of The Tartan has worked tirelessly tc 
revive CMU’s oldest source of student 
news. I am amazed and inspired by 
their accomplishments. To make the 
transition from a organization that was 
nearly forced to fold in the spring ol 
2004 to a Pacemaker finalist newspaper
— in the space of only one year — is a 
fantastic accomplishment. I applaud the 
success of all the people who have con­
sistently given their time and energy tc 
this paper. This honor is yours.
As the Executive Officer of The Tar­
tan, I am responsible for ensuring that 
The Tartan is capable of publishing an 
exceptional newspaper, but it is m> 
co-workers who are really in charge 
of creating each issue. Editor-in-Chiel 
J.T. Trollman guides the content of the 
newspaper. J.T. has led The Tartan’s 
content and style in a more dynamic 
direction, encouraging engaging fea­
ture stories and daring designs. Man­
aging Editor Franklin Williams ensures 
that the editorial staff is on point and 
that general weekly operations run 
smoothly. Frankie has been invaluable 
in helping members of The Tartan’s 
staff on many levels at the paper and 
otherwise. I thank them both, and con­
gratulate them on their work.
The entire editorial and managerial 
staff deserves congratulation as well: 
Ali Kilduff, Jackie Brook, Jim Puls. 
Christian D’Andrea, Radha Chitale. 
Mandy Flynn, Greg Prichard, Robert 
Kaminski, Danielle Saudino, Arthui 
O’Dwyer, Evan Sundwick, Allison Gal­
lant, Kevin Chang, Brittany Smith and 
Erika Matsumoto have lead The Tartan’s 
staff in a swift and dramatic trip to the 
top. I am honored to work with such an 
exceptional staff.
Interestingly, our recent commenda­
tion, which came at a time when I was 
temporarily away from CMU and The 
Tartan, helped me realize one of the 
most important lessons I have learned.
The ability to lead is a highly ad­
mired trait in our culture, but the com­
mon notion of leadership is somewhat 
warped. The word “leader” elicits 
thoughts of a bold, heroic adventurei
— someone with all the answers and 
the charisma to rally his or her troops 
to success. How realistic is that? Mod­
ern management guru Peter Senge 
calls this the myth of the hero-leader.
What are the chances that every suc­
cessful company has enough of these 
hero-leaders to fill all the management 
positions in all departments of the 
company? Not likely. Instead, Senge 
suggests that success comes when an 
organization becomes willing to learn, 
innovate, and change. I believe it.
Since the spring of 2004, The Tartan 
has undergone a near-complete turn­
over in staff, and as we’ve rebuilt we’ve 
collectively developed a culture that 
naturally evolves. How then does that 
leave room for a leader?
“A leader is best when people barel> 
know he exists,” as the Chinese phi­
losopher Lao Tzu wrote in the fourth 
century BCE. I’m convinced that more 
important than wild, charismatic 
antics are the subtle, consistent ac­
tions that help facilitate the innova­
tive organizational culture that Senge 
advocates. With a staff that is as com­
mitted, capable, and ready to evolve as 
The Tartan’s, it is easy for me to lead in 
that nuanced, slightly invisible way.
My applause and congratulations tc 
all The Tartan’s staff, who are now at 
one of the nation’s greatest university 
newspapers.

Indian environmental art­
ist Nayjot Altaf will be visiting 
campus to present the next 
installment of the School of 
Art Lecture Series Tuesday 
evening at 6 pm in McConomy 
Auditorium.
Altaf will be at CMU just three 
days before the Regina Gouger 
Miller gallery shows off some 
of her work in “Groundworks: 
Environmental Collaboration 
in Contemporary Art,” a new 
exhibit opening Friday and 
running through Dec. 11.
Living and working in 
Mumbai and Bastar, India, Altaf 
has spent the last two decades 
producing sculptures and video 
art in various installations
around the world, according to 
the online environmental art 
museum www.greenmuseum. 
org. Cooperative works with 
musicians, filmmakers, and 
craftspeople in the early 1990s 
also led her to mount a series 
of interactive projects in Indian 
villages, including installations 
surrounding communal water 
pumps.
“We hope to beautify the 
public sites where women, 
children, and men of all ages
come for a mundane job, like 
fetching water, as many as 
10 times a day,” Altaf wrote 
in a statement published on 
www.greenmuseum.org.
Altafs work has previously 
been displayed in Mumbai, Tel 
Aviv, Düsseldorf, and London, 
among other places.
Brent Mickum, the U.S. 
attorney for three detainees at 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will 
speak about his cases and ex­
perience Thursday at 5 pm in 
Doherty Hall 2210.
A senior litigation division 
partner at Keller and Heckman 
law firm in Washington, D.C., 
Mickum has been working 
pro bono on the Guantanamo 
case with the Center for Con­
stitutional Rights since March 
2004.
He initially became interested
in the situation of prisoners at 
the U.S. Naval base in Cuba, 
which he called “an impor­
tant moral benchmark for the 
country,” from reading Su­
preme Court decisions. “My 
father clerked for the Supreme 
Court, and as a consequence 
I’ve always been interested in 
the Supreme Court and have 
always followed it,” Mickum 
said.
Of the three detainees he rep­
resents, one — British citizen
Martin Mubanga — has been 
freed. The other two — British 
residents Bisher al-Rawi and 
Jamil el-Banna — are among 
the estimated 540 prisoners 
still in Cuba. “I can tell you — 
and I’ve seen all the evidence to 
date — they’re innocent,” Mic­
kum said.
Mickum’s work at Guanta­
namo and other issues sur­
rounding the U.S.’ treatment 
of detainees will be the topic of 
his lecture Thursday, which will, 
discuss “what my experiences 
have been, what I’ve seen, what 
I’ve heard, and what I’m do­
ing,” he said. “If nothing else, 
my talk should generate some 
interest in what’s going on.”
The lecture is being spon­
sored by AB Political Speakers, 
part of the CMU Activities 
Board.

THE TARTAN « OCTOBER 10, 2005
Printing quota the result of a student and faculty survey last semester
by Mansour Nehlawi
&
Jonathan Sitrin
Junior Staffwriters
“Make it not suck.”
That was one student’s request 
for changes to the CMU print­
ing system when asked for an 
opinion by a small user outreach 
group of CMU Computing Ser­
vices members last semester. The 
group, charged with the task of 
renovating the printing system, 
released this student’s statement, 
among the rest of its more formal 
data, on January 30, 2004, to the 
CMU community. Their results 
showed that the great majority of 
students wanted a change. Among 
their needs were “stricter and 
more aggressive enforcement of 
page limits” and shorter queues 
for printing jobs.
CMU Computing Services used 
this information to implement this 
semester’s new $40 per student 
per semester printing quota.
The group analyzed four 
major categories: quality, cost, 
convenience, and speed. While 
answers varied, the general
response was to create a type of 
limit on printing. The survey also 
asked if students would be will­
ing to use a print kiosk system. A 
66 percent positive response rate 
supported this idea.
Have the problems been solved? 
Almost everyone seems to agree 
that printing is cleaner and more 
efficient, to some extent. The 
printers are quicker and reduced 
the extreme amounts of printing 
and long waits for printing jobs.
Jonathan Perry, a junior psy­
chology major, said, “I definitely 
.don’t miss the long queues that 
would make me late for class.” 
Perry also likes that “this quota is 
helping the environment since less 
paper and ink are being wasted.”
However, not all are as thrilled 
as Perry. Students worry that they 
will be faced with a limit that does 
not meet their printing needs. 
Erin Danehy, a junior English and 
creative writing major, said, “It’s 
not fair for those who have to print 
more than 50 pages per reading 
assignment.”
Sharon Dilworth, professor of 
English and creative writing, said, 
“This quota has even affected 
the students’ work to a certain
extent, since they now take into 
account the length of their papers 
when writing.” Over 40 percent of 
professors in both the College of 
Fine Arts and the School of Com­
puter Science reported needing 
between 750 and 1000 pages 
per month for classes, with most 
other colleges not far behind in 
the high-30-percent range. How­
ever, according to the survey 
results conducted by the survey 
group, about 85 percent of those 
surveyed wanted no more than 
500 pages per semester. So why 
has this problem arisen, since the 
printing service gives students 
800 pages per semester?
One student, senior CS major 
James Tong, explains, “This quota 
doesn’t take into account the 
printing needed outside of our 
academic lives.” Tong reports that 
Mock Trial, one of his clubs, re­
quires a minimum of 3000 pages. 
“How am I supposed to manage 
this with an 800-page quota?”
Tong’s opinion mirrors the cries 
of frustration on campus. Meena 
Lakhavani, the Director of User 
and Educational Services, clari­
fies that “printing is not a part of 
tuition. Computing Services has
always allotted a certain amount 
of money to printing for the Uni­
versity. The quota actually low­
ered the cost of maintaining a 
functioning printing system on 
campus.” It has “saved a lot of 
trees and has allowed us to allot 
more money to classroom tech­
nologies, the first of which was in­
creased Web space implemented 
this semester.”
She continues, “Students should 
not worry too much about going 
over the quota; experimentally, 
95 percent of users last year did 
not go over this year’s limits.”
As for the clubs, Lakhavani 
states, “Clubs are responsible for 
a budget, and Computing Services 
assumes that printing would be

Its main goal is to link historical 
interpretations of race, work, 
and economic change with 
contemporary analyses of the 
urban labor force, employment

CAUSE hopes to initiate a new 
program for training graduate 
students in the methodology of 
oral history, and the overall hope 
is to finally gain a sense of what 
life was like after the 1940s.
“The post-World-War-II years 
are replete with unanswered 
questions about the nature of 
black migration, work, culture, 
and political change from the 
vantage point of ordinary people 
and everyday life,” Trotter said 
in the online press release. 
“[Pittsburgh] had a profound 
impact on the development of 
the class structure in the African- 
American community.”
WILSON, from A1finished and premiered earlier 
this March at the Yale Repertory 
Theatre, where some of Wilson’s 
other plays were first produced. 
There is now talk of staging 
his last play in the very theater 
that will be named for him on 
Broadway.
Born on April 27, 1945,
originally as Frederick August 
Kittel, Wilson was the son of 
a German baker. He took his 
mother Daisy Wilson’s last name 
when his father died in 1965. 
Wilson attended Central Catholic 
High School in Oakland, where 
he was the only black student. 
He eventually dropped out at the 
end of his freshman year after 
being constantly teased, but 
continued to go to Oakland every 
day to visit the Carnegie Library, 
where he continued to feed his 
craving for literature.
Wilson’s big break came when
where Wilson was raised.
Each one covers a different 
decade in the 20th century, 
spanning a total of 100 years.
Radio Golf, play number ten 
within the cycle, was recently
he met Lloyd Richards, head of 
the Yale Repertory Theatre, who 
went on to direct six of his plays 
on Broadway.
From then on, Wilson’s life was 
heavily decorated, with more than 
two dozen honorary doctorates, a 
National Humanities Medal, and 
two Pulitzer Prizes, one in 1987 
for Fences and another in 1990 
for The Piano Lesson.
Wilson also obtained his high 
school diploma, the only high 
school diploma to be issued by 
the Carnegie Library.
Perhaps the only thing greater 
than the impression he left on 
the theatrical stage was the 
impression he left on his old 
community, and the exposure 
he gave it. The Hill District is 
now known to critics across the 
country, and its distinct culture 
is available for everyone to learn 
about and experience.
is structured. “Pittsburgh is both 
like and quite different from 
some other cities in the U.S.,” 
remarked Trotter. “One thing 
which is unique about Pitts­
burgh is how it has many differ­
ent African-American neighbor­
hoods within the city, instead of 
one centralized community.”
The oral history’s main inten­
tion is to provide an additional 
source of information for future 
students, as well as to attract a 
new generation of scholars to the 
study of black history. CAUSE is 
collaborating with archivists at 
CMU’s Hunt Library in an effort 
to save a place in time for the 
oral histories. The project’s or­
ganizers hope to make the recol­
lections available electronically 
and in manuscript form.
CAUSE was established in 
1995, and is staffed by direc­
tor Trotter, assistant director
others, form what is commonly 
referred to as his Pittsburgh 
Cycle, because nine of the ten 
plays are set in the Hill District,

Relay for Life promotes cancer research
RELAY, from Al
University of Pittsburgh.
“The event combines so many 
organizations on campus. It 
brings people together where 
they can all meet each other,” 
said Relay for Life committee Co- 
Chair Amanda Gonzales, a junior 
biological sciences major.
Kavita Arora, a CMU student 
on the relay team for the Inter­
national Association for the Ex­
change of Students for Technical 
Experience (IAESTE’s), agreed, 
saying that Relay for Life gave 
her group the chance to not only 
support cancer research but also 
to publicize IAESTE’s goals to the 
many students gathered at the 
event. Emily Alex, a University of 
Pittsburgh junior and Navy ROTC 
team member, said she saw Relay 
as an opportunity to both support 
research and maintain an active
involvement in the community.
According to its website at 
www. cancer. org/RelayOnline, 
Relay for Life is much more than
Students and other 
community members 
came and went 
throughout the night, 
while many camped 
out in tents on the 
Gesling Stadium 
field.
just an overnight fundraiser. It is 
also an appeal to the community 
to support cancer survivors and 
recognize that the ongoing battle
against cancer requires “contin­
ued support from all members of 
the community,” whether or not 
they have been affected by can­
cer.
Although the Relay began 
with a more solemn vigil, it also 
featured games and activities. 
Besides walking on the track, 
participants also enjoyed glow- 
in-the-dark limbo, fortune tell­
ing, a live DJ, and many other 
activities. Students and other 
community members came and 
went throughout the night, while 
many camped out in tents on the 
Gesling Stadium field.
This year’s Relay for Life Com­
mittee chairman, Scott Smith, 
chose to focus on the event’s 
goal of raising money for cancer 
research, saying, “Treatments 
for cancer have been developed 
as a result of funding from these 
events.”
Flu shots will be available this year
FLU, from Al
added that at the November 2 
Health Fair students can purchase 
a vaccination; Health Services “is 
expecting hundreds of doses.”
Flu prevention has concerned 
many, and in recent weeks the 
standard flood of warnings about 
clean hands and work areas has 
shown up in fliers and e-mails. 
CNN.com recently pointed out 
that preschools and kindergarten
classes could harbor the virus. 
Young children, as they are more 
vulnerable to the flu, could aid 
the. virus’ expansion. The Chil­
dren’s School in Morewood Gar­
dens is also preparing for possible 
flu cases. Erlina Mae Bowers of 
the Children’s School said that 
she and her staff make sure that 
their students take preventative 
measures and keep the flu at bay 
as much as they can; a few have 
missed classes already due to flu-
related symptoms. “I don’t believe 
being around children makes 
anyone more vulnerable,” she 
stressed, “but we’re always cau­
tious. Everyone should be. You 
can get the flu anywhere.” 
Dawson noted that in the com­
ing weeks Health Services will 
begin posting dates and times 
when students can receive flu 
vaccinations on public bulletin 
boards and in a number of stu­
dent publications.
RIAA begins second sweep at CMU
SUBPOENAS, from Al
that Internet2 is a closed net­
work,” Smith said. “People think 
sharing can’t be seen. That’s just 
false.”
This is the second wave of RIAA 
subpoenas to Carnegie Mellon 
students. Last April, up to 40 stu­
dents were issued letters of in­
tent to subpoena from the RIAA. 
Although many people felt the 
letters were merely a warning, 
the RIAA has followed up on its 
subpoenas.
One Carnegie Mellon student, 
who wishes to remain anony­
mous, received a letter of intent to 
subpoena last spring. In August, 
he received a letter requesting 
a settlement — an agreement 
that could cost him thousands of 
dollars.
According to the student, settle­
ment consists of paying $750 per 
violation. Settlement amounts 
are determined in proportion 
to how many songs a student is 
claimed to have been sharing. If 
the student doesn’t wish to settle,
he can be sued for $750 for each 
song. Depending on the students’ 
“brackets,” students can be sued 
for multiple thousands of dollars.
Computing Services has not yet 
figured out all of the students 
that will receive letters of intent 
to subpoena this fall. They have 
until next week to submit names 
to the RIAA.
Considering this is the second 
wave of RIAA subpoenas, Smith 
said, “It’s not hard to identify any­
one who is sharing copyrighted 
files.”

Katzenberg brings DreamWorks to the ETC
Marcus Gho/Photo Staff
Theater major Lenny Larsen shows DreamWorks CEO Jeff Katzenberg how he’s directing Quasi, an animatronic robot developed at the ETC.
by J.T. Trollman
Editor-in-Chief
“I have to go back to my teacher, 
Walt Disney,” said DreamWorks 
CEO Jeff Katzenberg on Thurs­
day. “In the field of animation, 
always in the back of it has been 
technology.”
• That’s why at 1 pm that af­
ternoon, Katzenberg and his 
DreamWorks entourage showed 
up at the doorstep of the Enter­
tainment Technology Center. 
DreamWorks is looking for uni­
versities that share its interests, 
and where else would they go but 
to Carnegie Mellon?
The second and fifth floors of 
the Pittsburgh Technology Cen­
ter building were abuzz well 
before Katzenberg arrived. Men 
and women in black polos were 
milling around the elevators, 
waiting. “He just left from the 
airport!” someone announced to 
the group up on the fifth floor, 
amid walls lined with Star Wars 
figurines and Atari consoles. 
Randy Pausch, the ETC’s co­
director, came up in the elevator 
— and then raced back down the 
hallway to meet Katzenberg on 
the ground floor.
“I’m excited!” Pausch yelled 
behind him, passing a cluster of 
console games as he left. And 
from the look of it, he wasn’t the 
only one.
Pausch was prepared, too.Kat­
zenberg would be taken through 
five demo rooms of the ETC in 
roughly one and a half hours, 
showing off “what [the ETC stu­
dents] dream up.” After that, 
Katzenberg would give a talk to 
a full McConomy Auditorium, jet 
to Providence, R.I., to give Brown 
a once-over, and then go to sleep 
in California. When the Dream­
Works crew showed up, there 
wouldn’t be a minute to lose.
Katzenberg stepped out of the 
elevator just after one o’clock that 
afternoon, with the expression of 
a true CEO. He stood significantly 
shorter than anyone in the small 
crowd of people who surrounded 
him, but it was clear to even the 
untrained eye who the VIP of this 
group was. Katzenberg walked, 
in a crisp white shirt and black 
slacks, like someone who knew 
exacdy what he wanted to see.
Along with him were three 
DreamWorks associates. One of 
the three, Nathan Loofbourrow, 
graduated in 1992 from CMU 
with a BS in mathematics and 
computer science. (He now
heads character development 
on the upcoming 2008 release 
Kung Fu Panda.') The other two 
— Marilyn Friedman and John 
Tarnoff — both head the “out­
reach” program at DreamWorks, 
and were quick to show interest 
in how CMU’s research applied to 
them.
“The average employee at 
DreamWorks right now is 28 
years old, and has been with us 
for six years,” Katzenberg later 
said of his company. So it was 
fitting that each of the students 
presenting their work — five 
demos in all — were in the per­
fect hiring age range.
The first demo showed just how 
closely CMU’s research can come 
to DreamWorks’ interests. Fifth- 
year computer science graduate 
student Caitlin Kelleher showed 
off a programming system based 
on “Alice v2.0,” an open-source 
3D animation program that aims 
to take the pains of coding out of 
scene-making.
“People never touch the key­
board with Alice,” Pausch said 
over Kelleher’s shoulder, “and
yet they can write 3000-line pro­
grams.”
Katzenberg nodded as 
Kelleher walked him through the 
interface: a simple drag-and- 
drop affair that allowed Kelleher 
to switch “if-else” statements 
and objectives with ease. If, for 
example, an ice skater glides 
over a hole Kelleher puts down, 
the skater will fall; she can even 
add modifiers to give the skater a 
comical expression before letting 
gravity take hold.
The program has two versions, 
the second being a middle-school 
variation that aims to 
“trick” students, girls 
in particular, into 
coding. The balance,
Pausch chuckled, was 
choosing when to tell 
them what they were 
doing, beyond simply 
creating a storyline:
Tell the middle-school 
girls they’re coding 
too soon, and they’ll get intimi­
dated. Tell them too late, and it 
won’t foster the interest to learn 
more. Fewer than two percent of 
female college students are com­
puter or information-systems 
majors, he said; Alice might help 
work against that statistic.
After wrapping up, at least 
eight pairs of shiny black shoes 
clopped down the hall to greet 
three graduate students and pro­
fessor Jesse Schell. Schell shared 
more than just a common tech­
nology interest with Katzenberg; 
he held the Disney connection, 
too. The former creative direc­
tor at Disney’s Virtual Reality 
Studio, Schell showed how these 
three grad students — with back­
grounds ranging from fine arts to
architecture — had helped cre­
ate HazMat: Hotzone, the virtual 
training ground for firefighters 
nationwide.
Working with the New York 
Fire Department, Schell and his 
students aim to have HazMat fin­
ished for a Spring 2007 release. 
A video showed how firefight­
ers were already using the net­
worked game engine to train in 
entry and exit scenarios.
“The level of technology that 
allows you to do these types of 
simulations has suddenly be­
come affordable,” Schell said of
the game engine. “Three years 
ago, we wouldn’t have been able 
to think of this.”
“Quasi” was next on the stop 
list — the new official robotic 
mascot for the World’s Fair For 
Kids. Programmed to be either 
interactive or spoken through us­
ing a microphone and PC tablet 
for motion direction, Katzenberg 
was quick to pick up on the fact 
that this was the first portable 
model since Quasi’s inception in 
April 2004.
“Do you want to go to Disney- 
world?” he laughed, alluding to 
the World Fair For Kids’ location 
in Orlando. Although the origi­
nal robot took six students one 
semester to build, this $30,000 
version was designed by 11
students in only 11 weeks.
“This version is for travel­
ing and puppeteering live,” said 
Sabrina Haskell, an SCS gradu­
ate. “We can actually color his 
dancing with the emotion map, so 
he can dance sad or confused.” 
Quasi’s demonstration elic­
ited the most response from 
Katzenberg’s associates, Fried­
man and Tarnoff — enough 
that they asked to see “under 
the hood” afterward. Quasi’s 
complaints of indecency didn’t 
seem to register.
“Twenty-five percent of our 
staff is in technology,” Kat­
zenberg would later say in 
his talk in McConomy Au­
ditorium. Pointing to CMU 
graduate Loofbourrow 
and his work on Kung Fu 
Panda, he smiled, “So he’s 
basically Frankenstein — 
he builds an actor.” Now, 
Katzenberg is looking for 
more builders — and, as 
Pausch put it, “obviously we were 
on his list.”
Asked what interested students 
should consider when deciding 
their major, Katzenberg laughed. 
“Well, I started in politics,” 
he said. “I didn’t get a college 
degree. I don’t know what you all 
are doing here.”
But obviously, he does know. 
Katzenberg has seen firsthand 
what students at the ETC can do 
now. Today, there are 1100 peo­
ple working at DreamWorks, in 
150 disciplines, speaking 37 dif­
ferent languages — and there’s 
always room for more.
“Just get in the door,” Kat­
zenberg said to McConomy’s 
students. “And if you can’t get in 
the door? Go in the basement.”

Nicole, a great white shark, 
logged more than 12,000 miles 
swimming from Southern Africa 
to Australia and back, the first 
proof of a link between the two

researchers say. A temporary 
satellite tracking device docu­

Six months later, Nicole was 
identified from photos taken off

Cryostat ice explorer 
destroyed Sunday
Space agencies are investigat­
ing why the rocket carrying a 
European mission to map polar 
ice fell into the ocean. The Eu­
ropean Space Agency’s Cryo­
stat spacecraft was lost minutes 
after liftoff from the Plesetsk 
Cosmodrome in northern Rus­
sia on Saturday evening. Russian 
space officials said that both the 
spacecraft and the two top parts 
of its rocket had fallen into the 
Arctic Ocean, north of Green­
land, shortly after take off. Any 
moves to rebuild the mission 
now rest on funding.

They can’t stop 
playing video games
Video games are hugely popu­
lar in South Korea. For many, the 
addiction has become consum­
ing, raising concerns about the 
health of millions of gamers in 
the world’s most wired country. 
The government is embracing 
electronic sports as well, fund­
ing construction of the world’s 
first e-sports stadium, to be com­
pleted by 2008. However, the 
habit has been deadly, as well: In 
August, a 28-year-old man died 
after nearly 50 straight hours of 
playing online computer games.

Wireless earphones 
are finally here
It’s a brave new wireless 
world, yet most portable-audio 
systems are still tangled up in 
headphone cords. Soon, though, 
you’ll have many wireless ste­
reo headphones to choose from. 
The technology isn’t new, but 
until recently it was too bulky 
and expensive to shove into the 
tiny gadgets we love. Expect to 
see three flavors — Bluetooth, 
Wi-Fi, and magnetic induction 
— rolling out between now and 
early next year. These airy head­
phones will connect wirelessly 
to audio players, mobile phones, 
laptops, stereo systems and game 
consoles for unprecedented mu­
sical bliss.

Smoking linked to 
popularity
In a new study of sixth and 
seventh graders, popularity was 
found to be the number-one 
characteristic in common be­
tween students who were smok­
ers. Popularity was measured 
as the number of times a stu­
dent was named as a friend by 
their peers. This statistic was 
prevalent over other factors 
like gender, ethnicity, academic 
performance, sex, and parental 
smoking. Even in schools where 
the overall smoking populations 
were low, popular students did 
most of the smoking.

How Things Work: Political Asylum
William Nicoll
What if someone barged into your 
apartment or dorm room in the middle 
of the night, threatening you, your fam­
ily, and your livelihood? What if civil 
war in Pennsylvania forced you to move 
to Canada? What if the government 
was critical of your political views, sug­
gesting not-too-subtly that you get out 
of Dodge? Although these situations 
sound far-fetched in Pittsburgh, millions 
around the world have left their homes 
and countries because they fear for their 
lives in similar situations. These people 
are refugees.
World leaders were forced to confront 
refugee issues in the aftermath of World 
War II, when millions of Europeans wan­
dered aimlessly through a battered con­
tinent. Although several international 
agencies existed to provide support for 
refugees after the war, no official defi­
nition or legal framework existed for 
nations to deal with refugees for an en­
tire decade, until 1951.
It was then that the committee known 
as the United Nations High Commis­
sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) put before 
the world the first set of international
guidelines for dealing with refugees. 
This document, known as the Conven­
tion Relating to the Status of Refugees, 
defines who is legally a refugee and what 
their rights are.
According to the Convention, a refu­
gee is someone who has a “well-founded 
fear of being persecuted for reasons of 
race, religion, nationality, membership 
of a particular social group or political 
opinion,” and has left his or her home 
country. The definition explicitly ex­
cludes convicts and war criminals, and it 
should also be noted that someone who 
voluntarily leaves their country without 
fear of persecution — for example, for 
economic reasons — isn’t a refugee, but 
a migrant.
Actually becoming a refugee is known 
as seeking political asylum. It begins as 
soon as would-be refugees set foot on an­
other nation’s soil, by whatever means, 
legally or illegally. If the country they 
enter determines that they are truly refu­
gees, then certain rights and protections 
are given to them until they can return 
home or seek citizenship elsewhere.
Many of these rights are equal to those 
given to foreign nationals, and some are 
even equal to citizens’ rights. Among
others, refugees are guaranteed the 
right to employment, elementary educa­
tion, protection from taxes targeted spe­
cifically for refugees, use of the judicial 
system, and even intellectual property 
protection.
One of the most important rights of 
the Convention is the prohibition of 
refoulement. Refoulement is the practice 
of sending refugees back to their country 
of origin when a threat of persecution still 
exists. Although the Convention forbids 
refoulement, it has been interpreted to 
varying degrees, some against the spirit 
of refugee protection.
The U.S., for example, was challenged 
in the 1993 Supreme Court case Sale 
v. Haitian Centers Council. During this 
time, it was the Coast Guard’s practice 
to turn back refugees in boats from Haiti 
before they reached U.S. waters. The 
government won the case, but it must 
now screen for potential refugees before 
returning them.
Since the Convention’s passage in 
1951, a total of 140 nations have become 
participants. Though this high level of 
involvement is promising, every mem­
ber nation isn’t able to provide the same 
level of protection for asylum-seekers as
outlined in the Convention. To deal with 
this, many nations have written declara­
tions modifying the guideline to better 
suit their country.
However, this was only the beginning 
of an emerging division over refugee law. 
Debate continues today and is more heat­
ed than ever. Many nations have cried 
foul of the increasingly large numbers of 
asylum seekers attempting to enter their 
countries. Human trafficking has lead to 
huge increases in refugee numbers — so 
high that the waiting list for asylum-seek­
ers wanting permanent resident status in 
the U.S. is 14 years!
The United Nations has also taken 
on new challenges to the definition of 
a refugee. Internally displaced refu­
gees who don’t cross international bor­
ders, refugees who have no citizenship, 
countries refusing large numbers of 
refugees, and previously unconsidered 
types of persecution like gender and non­
government persecution have all raised 
new challenges for today’s refugee law.
With close to 10 million refugees and 
25 million IDPs falling under the protec­
tion of the UNHCR, a large task remains. 
Still, maybe one day we can all just go 
home.

RACE, from Al
to drive and how fast we’re going 
to, drive, and that is definitely the 
thinking part of the race. It’s a 
long, long day in the dirt.”
The technology incorporated 
into both cars is like nothing done 
before. In layman’s terms, it could 
be MTV’s “Pimp My Ride” to the 
millionth power. Both vehicles 
use similar navigation technology 
to pick out their paths over ter­
rain. Plan sensors on the vehicles 
ipclude GPS, radar, four cameras, 
and seven LiDAR scanners.
LiDAR, which stands for Light 
Detection and Ranging, is a par­
ticularly useful feature of the ve­
hicles. Light is emitted from the 
LiDAR and interacts with a target 
object. The light is subsequently 
changed, reflected back to the 
lidar instrument, and analyzed. 
The incoming light is then used 
to determine the size, shape, and 
distance of the target.
A basic LiDAR device consists 
of a transmitter, a receiver, and 
a detection system. LiDAR uses 
radiation at wavelengths 10,000 
to 100,000 times shorter than 
radiation used by “conventional” 
radars. LiDAR can be bistatic — 
Which requires two locations to 
dpierate, one for the transmitter 
arid one for the receiver — or mo- 
nbstatic, which only requires one 
location to operate. Monostatic 
LiDAR is preferred over bistatic 
because there is only one location 
to staff, one instrument to oper­
ate, and the “aligning and point­
ing” feature is more straightfor­
ward.
Both vehicles use aerial LiDAR. 
Three cameras and one LiDAR 
scanner are suspended in a float­
ing gimbal within the vehicles. 
The camera and LiDAR sensor 
are mounted on an extremely 
stable swivel, giving the vehicles 
rotating “necks” with which to 
scan their environment and point 
them along the intended route.
The sensory mechanisms are 
constantly working to provide 
navigation feedback and pick 
the best path along the terrain. 
Aj“path corrector” will alter the 
preplanned route if any obstacles
get in the way. As the vehicles 
continue, 6000 candidate paths 
are generated each second. Ideal 
paths are put together so quickly 
that they merge into one smooth 
continuum, allowing the vehi­
cle to simply plow ahead on its 
course.
The race course, announced 
two hours before the start time, 
covered 132 miles of Nevada 
desert. The most treacherous ob­
stacle awaited challengers at the 
Beer Bottle Pass. Only 1.5 miles 
long, the Pass is so narrow that 
a wrong turn here could have 
cost challengers the race — and 
even their vehicles, sending them 
plummeting 100 feet over a cliff 
into a canyon. Then again, this 
is precisely the kind of terrain 
that the Red Teams were built to 
take on. “We have rock-solid posi­
tion estimation,” Whittaker said. 
“Our robots really know where 
they are; they know where they 
are going; they know how to get 
there; and they are tremendous 
at driving and maneuvering.”
Though Stanford walked away 
with the $2 million grand prize, 
up from the promised $1 mil­
lion last year, the benefits of 
even participating in the Grand 
Challenge, much less complet­
ing it in unprecedented times, 
are far reaching. There is a whole 
movement “just hungry for these 
technologies.... All those things 
are in huge demand,” Whittaker 
explained. “The idea of robot 
mobility is fundamental to the 
advancement of robotics.... The 
technologies are not just mobile 
but also high performance. These
are serious companies. You build 
new alliances, a new generation 
of people; you need the best and 
you need a lot of them.” 
According to Whittaker, there 
is no limit to where CMU could 
go from here: “That’s just the tip 
of the iceberg. Future revenue is 
huge in research and industry.” 
Job opportunities are ripe for 
participants, too. The ¡Robot 
corporation, which Whittaker 
explained wasn’t racing, simply 
came “to pick off people. They are 
hiring one person each day.” 
Make no mistake, though, this 
is not just a playground for robot 
or car fans. This is serious busi­
ness. “Breakfast is 3 in the morn­
ing, then preplanning practice is 
at 4 ^m, and we are trackside by 6. 
You’ve got to be ready to go when 
that sun comes up,” Whittaker 
said. “It’s like Buggy at CMU.” 
Similar commitment and drive 
is required, according to Whit­
taker. “There’s a lot of the CMU 
culture that really matters in a 
race like this.... Those are leaders 
of the future, and they are won­
derful people.”
Everyone involved in the Red 
Teams will walk away from this 
experience better for it. “Univer­
sities teach all kinds of things, 
including how to live life,” Whit­
taker said. “Most things worth 
doing aren’t easy, and they aren’t 
fast. You play with what you got, 
and how things turn out, that’s 
the way they are supposed to be. 
The right thing to do is choose 
something you love, go after it 
with everything you got, and 
that’s what life is about.”

Beware of bird flu subterfuge
It never fails: When the government’s 
PR is tanking, they roll out scare tactics.
Don’t look at Senate Majority Leader 
Bill Frist’s insider stock trading scandal. 
Don’t look at House Majority Leader 
Tom DeLa^s mounting indictment over 
cheating campaign finance laws. And 
hey, avert your eyes from puppetmaster 
Karl Rove’s involvement in Plamegate. 
Look over here: there might be bird flu, 
everyone. And look over here! More 
potential terrorist attacks! Are you quak­
ing in fear yet? Good.
The situation is admittedly more com­
plicated than Bush simply reading a pa­
perback on the 1918 flu epidemic and 
giving a book report press conference af­
terwards. Scientists have warned about 
the possibility of another avian flu out­
break for years, and Newsweek recently 
reported that at its current production 
rate, there would only be enough treat­
ment for 1.5 percent of the world’s popu­
lation by 2006. But it smacks of sleazy
intent for Bush to skate around issues of 
Katrina response rates and his own ad­
ministration’s failings, suddenly bringing 
up a topic that those in the know have 
been yammering about for years. Some­
thing doesn’t sound quite right here.
To push the matter further, Bush 
coupled his bird flu announcement with 
further attempts to shore up waning 
support in the Iraq war and the battle 
against terror — a fight that he consis­
tently mischaracterizes as if it’s a battle 
against a single, tangible entity.
Bird flu press conferences shouldn’t 
absolve Bush of accountability for his 
administration’s missteps, and that’s pre­
cisely what Bush is skirting right now. 
The failings of those around him — es­
pecially his hand-picked government 
leaders — reflect directly upon his own 
judgment. Shouldn’t the top know, for 
example, that former House majority 
leader DeLay refused to see lobbyists 
who aren’t Republican? If Bush wanted
to help his image, he might want to 
shush his GOP compatriot when DeLay 
mouths off about his current indictment 
being “partisan politics.”
Even if Bush wanted to play it cool 
and distance himself from DeLay, Frist, 
and Rove — among others — he still has 
to answer to FEMA and Katrina. Tell­
ing then-current FEMA director Michael 
Brown, “You’re doing a heck of a job, 
Brownie,” when the former head of the 
International Arabian Horse Association 
had his head hidden in the sand, didn’t 
help to console the American public. 
But pay no attention to this. A lethal 
bird flu might kill you.
We’re glad that Bush is choosing to fi­
nally recognize the seriousness of avian 
flu epidemics, and thrilled that his ad­
ministration has helped trim back pos­
sible terrorist threats across the world. 
But with a current approval rating at a 
CBS-reported 37 percent, he’s got a bit 
more to answer for than a cold.
Lecture series would benefit from better PR
Readers may have noticed that, start­
ing this semester, The Tartan has pub­
lished a weekly column previewing up­
coming campus lectures. In an effort to 
alert students, faculty, and staff to inter­
esting speakers and lecture topics, the 
paper encourages writers to pick lectures 
they find appealing.
What The Tartan didn’t expect was 
how difficult this column would be to 
write. The difficulty lies in a key prob­
lem identified again and again on this 
campus — a failure of centralized com­
munication.
Finding out about interesting lectures 
and events is hit-or-miss at Carnegie 
Mellon. Events are frequently publicized 
with little more than a flyer on a crowded 
community bulletin board. Departments 
rarely advertise speakers to anyone other 
than their own students. On a campus 
where technology is supposed to bring 
students together, keeping us informed 
by word of mouth should be obsolete.
Many lectures are “centralized” in the 
University Lecture Series (ULS); they are 
sponsored by the University as a whole 
and are open to the public. Many of 
these speakers are provocative and well- 
chosen.
However, publicity is lacking. Often, 
students don’t know a speaker is arriving 
until he’s already here. At the begin­
ning of the semester, when the Indian 
ambassador to the United States came to 
speak on campus, many students missed 
out on an important and interesting 
speech simply because they didn’t know 
beforehand.
One can imagine a department’s re­
sponse: “But the lectures are all listed 
on posters around campus.” Vibrant, col­
orful posters? No. The posters are so 
banal, even the UC information desk 
didn’t know they had a lecture schedule 
until they hunted about, finally finding it 
in the supply closet.
“But all the lectures are on the Web 
portal,” a University official might say. 
First, the Web portal is still not used by 
many people on campus. Furthermore, 
finding the link to “View Events” and 
then sifting through an enormous calen­
dar is more labor-intensive than actually 
attending the lecture itself.
Even more disconcerting is the degree 
to which the ULS fails to self-promote, 
making the speaker-selection process 
inaccessible to students. By and large, 
students don’t know who runs the ULS 
(Indira Nair, Vice Provost for Educa­
tion) or how they can impact the series 
(students can submit speakers and offer 
their opinions about candidates). Had 
students played a more active role in 
shaping the speaker line-up last year, the
uproar over Abunimah and Finkelstein 
may well have been avoided.
There are some basic steps that the 
University could take to make sure 
that speaker selection and the events 
are more accessible to all students. To 
begin with, constant and innovative 
publicity is key. A grayscale flyer or 
a hard-to-find posting is not going to 
cut it at a school where students are 
constantly inundated with information, 
both in print and online. The ULS and 
other lecture promoters should take 
more care to post advertisements in 
places where students are sure to look: 
flyers could be posted in classrooms, 
where students would be have plenty of 
time to examine them. As of now, most 
classroom bulletin boards are covered 
with out-of-date, unhelpful, or irrel­
evant material.
Departments should be sure to of­
fer their lectures to an audience out­
side their own classes; there is always 
the possibility that art majors would 
be interested in a lecture on organic 
chemistry, and a CS major might want 
to learn more about international rela­
tions. Why narrow the audience of a 
speaker?
Stop placing your attention on con­
troversial speakers, and focus on the 
implementation of the lecture series.
Group invite: “I’m accountable 
for things I say on Facebook!”
Michelle Bova
Browsing through Fark.com the 
other day, I came upon an interesting 
article about students who had faced 
criticism at the University of Mississippi 
after creating a group on Facebook. 
The group proclaimed that members 
all wished to have sex with a certain 
professor.
The article, from insidehighered. com, 
went on to describe several incidents 
in which the university or members 
thereof took action when they saw 
what groups were being created on 
Facebook. Some posts at the end of the 
article argued that the colleges were 
asking students to “conform” by tell­
ing them to be careful about what they 
said online. Others argued it was sim­
ply a matter of being accountable and 
responsible.
But the thing that struck me most 
about the article was a single comment 
from a student at Columbia University. 
She created the group titled “We like to 
have hott [sic] sex in Butler [Library] 
and then get coffee from Blue Java.”
“Facebook is supposed to be... irrev­
erent,” the story quoted her as saying. 
“I’d be mortified if someone seriously 
asked me if I liked to have sex in Butler 
and then get coffee from Blue Java.”
I do not want to address the issue 
of whether or not students should be 
extra-diligent about their “digital pro­
files,” as some sources in the article 
suggested. What I want to address is 
the simple issue of accountability. Can 
you honestly expect to announce your 
name beside a statement and then deny 
accountability for it?
How can this Columbia student 
believe that her words are meaningless 
on Facebook? How can she assert that 
they should not be used to judge her 
actual desire to have sex in the school 
library at all?
I concede, Facebook is wide open 
for humor. I’m not asking to take 
the groups we belong to literally. I 
don’t actually want Optimus Prime to 
be President, but I could easily back 
up why I joined the group. (Optimus 
Prime as a candidate for anything is a 
running joke that’s campus-wide; the 
facetious nature is clear to Carnegie 
Mellon students.)
Students are out there putting their 
name beside statements that they 
actually would be “mortified” to be 
called out on. It’s a simple issue of say 
what you mean and be able to explain 
it. People might not actually want to 
have sex in the school library, but they 
shouldn’t assume no one takes their 
words seriously. I wouldn’t join the “I 
love to rub hot oil on my body” group 
because God knows I’ve never done it! 
If I did join the group I’d sure as hell 
want to back up why I joined. I would 
expect people to treat me as something 
of an authority on the matter.
Learn the obvious, students and post­
ers across the Web. If you put your 
name next to something, some people 
will take your support at face value. 
Deny it as a joke all you wish, but don’t 
say you didn’t expect people to inter­
pret parts of your character from it. You 
ought to be able to defend what you put 
your name on.
Even on a facetious, fluffy site like 
Facebook, I would hope that people 
do understand that the information 
they report is at the very least acces­
sible to others at their college. People 
understand that wit plays a role in a 
lot of Facebook groups, but they may 
also expect you to account for why you 
joined them. I think we’ve reached the 
stage where it is no longer a good excuse 
to say, “I joined this group because my 
friend was in it, even though I didn’t 
agree with what it said.”
Facebook is a forum for fun, silliness, 
and meaningless friendships. But it also 
is about real people. Your name, your 
dorm, your school, and your major are 
all listed on Facebook. You wouldn’t 
list those things inaccurately, so why 
would you put your name on some­
thing that you disagree with? Why join 
“I Want to Bang Professor Studly” if you 
don’t actually want to follow through? 
Maybe you just joined it for kicks. Fine, 
but once you’ve joined it, please don’t 
have the audacity to say you’re actu­
ally offended when I think you want to 
bang him.

creative and professional writing major. 
She belongs to “ILove Sex,” “Professional 
Writing is the Schiznit,” and “People

stands staunchly behind the sentiments 
expressed by every one of those groups.
Do not accept evolution on 
faith alone; give ID a chance
James Auwaerter
Over the last few weeks, Pennsyl­
vania has received national media 
attention as the location of the Scopes 
Monkey Trial for the 21st century. A 
school board in Dover, Pennsylvania, 
has required that intelligent design, the 
claim that some components of living 
things are too complex to have arisen by 
random chance, be taught as an alter­
native to evolution. Unfortunately, in 
this case both sides have been espous­
ing unscientific principles.
There’s a larger issue here, though. 
Opponents of intelligent design decry it 
because they see it as religion invading 
science and schools. Opponents of 
evolution feel that to say man arose 
through random chance means that 
man doesn’t matter. In either case, 
the issue is what role religious beliefs 
should play in public life.
Intelligent design is a theory. That 
said, it is more of a religious theory 
than a scientific one, since it cannot be
disproved. The concept of falsifiability 
is part of the bedrock of the scientific 
method, and intelligent design fails on 
this front. This does not mean that it 
might not also be true; being unable 
to prove something true doesn’t mean 
that it is false.
Lucky for the proponents of intelli­
gent design, its opponents are doing 
their best to get on shaky ground. The 
Associated Press reported that when 
Pennsylvania’s state board of educa­
tion revised its standards three years 
ago, it avoided requiring students to 
consider evidence that doesn’t sup­
port evolution. This happened because 
“critics alleged it would have led to 
the widespread teaching of creation- 
ism in public schools.” Unfortunately 
for those critics, accepting evolution 
or any scientific theory without look­
ing at any evidence to the contrary 
is accepting evolution on the basis of 
faith, and is just as unscientific as intel­
ligent design. Science advances by tak­
ing the information which doesn’t fit a 
theory and either changing the theory

“CIA. They get to know all kinds of crazy 
things that don’t get released to the 
public.”
Nicolette Louissaint
It’s been a while since I have 
shared my thoughts with you in a 
Presidential Perspectives article. 
It has been difficult for me to share 
my thoughts with the student 
body over the past few weeks 
because my full energy has not 
been dedicated to the traditional 
focus of student government.
In my opinion, the measure of 
one’s true strength is based on 
his or her response in times of cri­
sis. These times of crisis not only 
indicate our strength, but also 
allow us to grow and develop the 
fortitude we did not know that we 
possessed.
For me, the passing of my 
grandmother proved to be 
my greatest and most difficult 
personal experience. Almost 
exactly a year ago, I rushed 
to be with her as she fought a 
resurgence of cancer in her 
abdomen. As I held her hand on 
her deathbed, I witnessed two 
forms of strength that I did not 
fully comprehend until recently. 
I was greatly moved by her 
strength and assurance as she 
prepared herself for her passing. 
Her grace and composure were 
both admirable and frustrating, 
because I could not understand 
how she could be so strong while 
moving into a realm of which she 
knew nothing. Faith assured her 
and she relied on her instincts to 
find the strength she needed.
On the other side of the bed, 
I saw my mother, who had lived 
almost five decades with her 
mother’s love and physical pres­
ence. As she prepared to enter 
her first day without her mother, I 
observed as she, too, relied on the 
strength that she had garnered 
throughout her life to make it into 
the unknown.
Though I hope none of you 
ever has to experience a memory 
as intense and painful as this, I 
think there is something to be 
said for finding the strength you 
possess and being able to rely 
on it. In a world where leaders 
are needed and change is manda­
tory, we need to be able to find 
our personal strength to find our 
place. This campus, especially, 
needs individuals who can trust 
their personal ability in order to 
lead.
Leadership is always intimidat­
ing because it requires the courage 
to walk into the unknown, and 
help other people through this 
unknown as well. However, if we 
can learn to trust our instincts, 
which means naturally trust­
ing our inner ability, leadership 
becomes a much less daunting 
task.
This week, I challenge you, 
members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, to explore your inner 
ability to understand your talent 
for this campus and this world. 
Dissect yourself until you real­
ize the true power that lies with­
in you. I implore you to do so, 
because this campus is in desper­
ate need of leaders who can find 
their strength even when walk­
ing into the unknown and unex­
pected.

Religion can have a 
place in public schools
EVOLUTION, from A8
or explaining the evidence 
within the theory’s frame­
work.
Let’s be ' clear from the 
start: Children should not be 
taught any particular religion 
in school. Teachers should be 
teaching facts, and being very 
clear about the difference 
between proven facts, like 
those found in mathematics, 
and those facts which have 
been generally accepted but 
are still falsifiable, like most 
scientific theories. On the 
other hand, they should not 
be prevented from participat­
ing in religious ceremonies 
and duties, or from spending 
time outside of the normal 
class day schedule with reli­
gious clubs.
In the past half-century, the 
pendulum has swung in favor 
of secularism. “Separation of 
church and state,” a phrase 
that appears nowhere in the 
Constitution or the Bill of 
Rights, has nonetheless been 
guiding public policy. The 
Declaration of Independence 
states that all men “are 
endowed by their Creator 
with certain Inalienable
rights, that among these are 
Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit 
of Happiness”; the Founders 
understood that if these rights 
were based in Man’s laws, then 
Man could take them away. 
At its best, religion has pro­
vided for some of the crown­
ing achievements of human 
history, including the end of 
slavery in most of the world 
(though sadly, not all of it).
By removing religion from 
public discourse, we end up 
with utilitarianism and other 
forms of moral relativity rul­
ing the decision-making pro­
cess. Basing the worth of a 
person on the work he can do 
as opposed to assuming the 
worth of the person a priori, 
it’s possible to start viewing 
people as sub-human, a view 
that has led to many atroci­
ties in the past. Including reli­
gious beliefs as a part of public 
policy will continue to guar­
antee that such basic human 
rights will be preserved far 
into the future.

As the MLB playoffs com­
menced last weekend, I spent my 
weekend searching for tickets of 
the last regular season series. 
Planning a trip back home to 
New England for the AL East 
division series? Nope. Taking 
a three-hour drive for White 
Sox-Indians? Not even close. I 
was scoring third-row seats to an 
epic Brewers-Pirates showdown. 
What the hell is wrong with me?
Instead of screaming for 
Johnny Damon, I was watching 
Jack Wilson. Instead of Manny 
Ramirez, I had Freddy Sanchez. 
And you know what? I didn’t 
care. After spending a summer in 
Pittsburgh, I’ve become a Pirates 
fan. Fifteen home games later I’m 
watching these guys closer than 
the Red Sox. I’m okay with this.
Their win against the Devil 
Rays that brought the team to 
30-30? I was there, celebrat­
ing with the rest of the yinzers 
as the team celebrated their 
best 60-game start in a decade. 
Rookie phenom Zack Duke’s 
home debut? I saw him ring 
up eight strikeouts versus the 
Phillies. Jack Wilson’s Baseball 
Tonight Play of the Year with 
José Castillo? I spit out my beer 
watching Castillo throw out the 
baserunner at first.
The Pirates are the best thing 
Pittsburgh has to offer for both 
students and baseball fans, es­
pecially in the summer, when 
house parties wind down and 
options in the city at night be­
come limited to bars. Five-dollar 
student discount tickets are an 
attractive deal in the middle of 
the summer — there are no bad 
seats in PNC Park and the only 
drawback of sitting in the balco­
nies is getting a poor view of the 
pierogie races. Even better, wait 
until the game starts and watch 
the scalpers get nervous — most 
of the time you can pick up box 
seats for around $15.
Aside from the cheap seats, 
the location and parking setup 
breeds tailgating, combining 
open spaces with sufficient bath­
rooms to give fans a place to go 
before the game. You can grill up 
burgers and throw down a few 
beers before making your way to 
the game, or visit the nearby bars 
and restaurants. Plus, PNC is one 
of the few parks in the country 
that lets you bring in outside 
food and water, allowing you to 
avoid steep concession prices.
While the convenience of driv­
ing 10 minutes into town and 
paying five dollars for a ticket 
is a huge draw, what kept me 
coming back was the team it­
self. The players are young and 
likeable, and egos play no role 
on or off the field. There is no 
preening for the cameras — just 
pure baseball and teamwork. 
Pittsburgh’s best player, Jason 
Bay, is a quiet, hardworking guy 
who just gets better and better, 
but you wouldn’t know about 
him outside Pittsburgh unless 
you play fantasy baseball.
It’s difficult to say exactly 
what draws me to the guys on 
the team. Maybe it’s how short­
stop Jack Wilson couldn’t hit 
a lick this year, but, no matter 
what, strode to the plate with 
the Rolling Stones’ “Jumpin’ 
Jack Flash” blaring through the 
speakers. Maybe it’s how first 
.baseman Craig Wilson cut off 
his Thor-style long blond hair for 
charity, without making a media 
case of it like the aforementioned 
Johnny Damon. Or it could be 
the way José Castillo smoothly 
turns a double play without cre­
ating a scene of it.
. With the Pirates consistently 
at the bottom of their division, 
even fans in Pittsburgh don’t 
seem to care anymore. They get 
the media coverage they deserve, 
but the teaim gets none of the 
respect of the Steelers or even 
the new-look Penguins. Granted, 
Pittsburgh is a football town, but 
in the summer I expect more of 
a buzz about rookies like Ryan 
Doumit or Paul Maholm than 
someone impersonating Ben
Brighter days appear to be 
ahead, and maybe all it takes 
to get the team back in the con­
versations of Pittsburghers is a 
few wins. With the young talent 
the team has, and the search 
for a new manager on the way, 
we could be closer to that situa­
tion than ever before. No matter 
what, I’ll be at PNC Park 
for opening day, yelling for 
Freddy Sanchez, Tike Redman, 
Humberto Cota, and all the rest
conscious employment of the 
scientific method — are firmly 
grounded in biochemistry and 
other related disciplines. As there 
are no references to religious doc­
trine, the claim of equivalence to 
creationism is absurd and woe­
fully uninformed. Though its 
propositions may inevitably be 
proven incorrect (just as evolu­
tion’s may), the theory of intelli­
gent design is most assuredly not 
“pre-scientific mythology.”
In an age where the major­
ity of natural scientists seem to 
view religion and even spiritu­
ality as. their sworn enemies, 
Charles Darwin’s personal view 
on philosophy of religion is rarely 
known. Would he be pleased with 
the path mainstream “Darwin­
ism” has taken since his death
— accusing anyone who suggests 
the existence of a designer guilty 
of heresy? Indeed Darwinism has 
become an ideology, a sort of 
religion among increasingly re­
actionary scientists. Ironically, 
Darwin himself testified that the­
ism and evolution were not con­
tradictory beliefs. He insisted on 
calling himself an agnostic, main­
taining that he had “never been 
an atheist in the sense of denying 
the existence of a God.”
Though most critics claim 
otherwise, intelligent design 
makes no attempt to disprove the 
theory of evolution. H. Allen Orr,
a biologist at Rochester and critic 
of intelligent design, wrote of ID 
proponent and Lehigh University 
biochemist Michael Behe: “He 
has no problem with stories of 
moths evolving dark coloration 
so as to hide on polluted trees or 
of streptococci outwitting antibi­
otics. Nor does he deny common 
descent, the notion that all spe­
cies, including humans, are de­
rived from one or a few common 
ancestors.” Instead, Behe and 
other serious ID advocates high­
light biological complexities that 
are empirically unexplainable by 
the theory of evolution, suggest­
ing the possibility of design by a 
higher power, unseen force, or 
other unknown. Intelligent de­
sign begins in science and ends 
in philosophy, two disciplines in 
which logical inquiry and rational 
thought matter very much.
Because I despise the perver­
sion of science by ideologues with 
solely political or religious mo­
tives, I condemn those on the 
so-called “religious right” who 
have hijacked intelligent design 
as a means of implanting reli­
gion in public education. But I 
equally resent those detractors 
who respond to ID with polemics 
rather than scientific investiga­
tion. As a wise man once noted, 
“Every great advance in science 
has issued from a new audacity of 
the imagination.”
something that the Red Sox can’t: 
cheap, comfortable seats, incred­
ible views of the field, and a little 
dignity, even in defeat.

The controversial debate on in­
telligent design (ID) has led me to 
a single fascinating observation: 
When political ideology and re­
ligious fundamentalism manipu­
late science and science abandons 
reason for dogma, human intel­
ligence de-evolves at an exponen­
tial rate.
Intelligent design has a dual 
meaning: It is both a scientific 
theory and, separately, a socio­
political movement. Let us disre­
gard for a moment this latter defi­
nition, in which ID — hijacked 
by those with either politically 
conservative or religiously fun­
damental agendas — has become 
a fad. In an objective analysis of 
the theory itself, this sad reality 
becomes entirely irrelevant. Its 
claims must be evaluated on their 
own merits. Incredibly, though, 
the scientific community has 
come to a near-consensus in dis­
missing ID as resurrected cre­
ationism, illustrating what seems 
to be a lack of basic understand­
ing by those who ought to know 
better.
Detractors have used a variety 
of labels to characterize intelli­
gent design as unscientific, rang­
ing from “21st-century creation­
ism” to “religion masquerading as 
science.” Yet the arguments pos­
ited by ID — developed through

Men’s soccer wins critical UAA game in OT
File Photo
Midfielder Mathew Humphrey pushes the ball downfield during Wednesday’s 5-0 home victory over Point Park.
by Adam Greenberg
Contributing Alumnus
Junior forward Andrew Park 
got behind a Washington de­
fender and placed the ball in the 
far corner of the net behind the 
Bears’ goalkeeper Saturday night. 
The goal came nine minutes into 
an extra period that started score­
less and ended in a 1-0 Tartan 
victory.
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team (7—1—1, 1-1 UAA) 
beat the Washington University 
Bears on Park’s goal, his third 
game-winner in as many goals 
this season, The team’s defense 
also played a powerful front all 
evening.
The Tartans’ defense, which 
has yielded only one goal in nine 
games this season, kept the ra­
pacious Washington offense 
in check all night. The Bears 
were able to keep pace with the 
Tartans’ skilled ball-handling 
and actually outshot the Tartans 
13-11 through regulation, but it 
was Washington’s last shot that 
proved most hopeful for the Bears. 
Sophomore defensive back Chris 
Watts fought off the Washington 
forward, who then got a second
chance to net the ball from just 
behind the Tartans’ keeper. With 
only 20 seconds remaining in 
regulation, first-year goalkeeper 
Matthew Bazin made an amazing 
dive to grab the ball. The save 
preserved the scoreless tie and 
sent the game into overtime.
“They g<Dt a lucky bounce,” said 
Bazin, who 10 minutes earlier 
had slid to knock another close 
Washington shot aside, “but Chris 
Watts held him off and I was able 
to get there in time.”
The game was marked by un­
yielding aggressive play from 
both teams’ midfielders in con­
trolling the ball for their teams. 
Neither team fully controlled the 
pace of the game, but the natural 
ebb and flow of the game eventu­
ally benefited the Tartans. Their 
most effective attack came in the 
overtime period.
“They weren’t giving up and we 
weren’t giving up,” said first-year 
midfielder Daniel Brackey. “And 
then Andy [Park] had that goal.... 
We already had all those earlier 
chances in the last 15 minutes of 
the second half.” ,
The chances to which Brackey 
referred had been the Tartans’ 
best chances for scoring: In fact,
both teams very nearly scored late 
in the second half. Washington’s 
opportunity was the second- 
chance ball that Bazin grabbed, 
but the Tartans nearly had one 
of their own even before Park’s 
game-winner. In the 81st minute, 
the Tartans developed a 2-on-l 
and just missed a shot right of 
the goal.
Earlier, on Wednesday, the 
Tartans crushed the Point Park 
Pioneers 5-0, collectively out- 
shooting them 29-3. The game 
featured goals from five different 
Tartans, including Park and the 
team’s goals leader, junior for­
ward Jonathan Browne.
CMU, which fell in their UAA 
opener against Chicago last week­
end, now is back on track to con­
tend for their sixth straight con­
ference title. “Chicago’s goal was 
tough,” said Bazin of the only goal 
the team has given up this season, 
“but tonight it came together and 
I think we’re going to be rolling 
for the rest of the season.”
The Tartans play next week­
end at Gesling Stadium against 
Brandeis and New York University, 
two more conference opponents 
who are each looking for their 
first respective conference wins.
Women’s tennis trounces West Liberty
by Andrew Clearfield
Assistant Sports Editor
The women’s tennis team de­
feated Division II power West 
Liberty (W.Va.) 8-1 Tuesday, 
September 27, on the road. The 
Tartans swept the doubles and 
then breezed to victory, winning 
five of the six singles matches.
CMU All-American Amy 
Staloch, who had to withdraw 
from the ITA tournament with 
an eye infection, returned 
with a vengeance, scoring a 
6-0, 6-2 victory at No. 1 singles.
She was joined by Sheena David, 
Kelly Nakamura, Mai Otsuka, and 
Asako Hayashi as easy winners. 
Aside from No. 4 singles, which 
the Tartans’ Samantha Schultz 
lost to a red-hot Liz Allison 
6-4, 6-2, the Tartans did not 
drop a single set and lost only a 
total of 15 games.
CMU head coach Andrew 
Girard called the match a pivotal 
win for the program, saying. “To 
dominate a team like that shows 
where we are as a program. It 
was windy, on the road, at night 
right after a big tournament; I’m 
very happy we took care of it.”
The Tartans dominated right 
from the outset. In doubles, 
David and Staloch blitzed by the 
West Liberty team of Heather 
Alcorn and Brandi Mooney in 
less than 45 minutes, 8-0. The 
team of Schultz and Nakamura 
then won at No. 2 doubles 
8-4, and Allison Liu and Otsuka 
easily won at the No. 3 spot. The 
Tartans never gave up the mo­
mentum and quickly closed out 
the match, winning the neces­
sary two singles matches (best- 
of-nine format) in less than an 
hour. CMU is now 2-0 on the 
season in team competition.
Baseball — First-year pitcher 
Jon Coens had ^ dominant per­
formance against Penn State- 
Beaver, throwing seven strong 
innings and allowing only one 
run and five hits. He needed only 
64 pitches to finish his fourth 
complete game of the season.
Men’s soccer — Junior forward 
Andrew Park scored the decid­
ing goal in the Tartans’ 1-0 vic-
tory over Washington University 
in St. Louis Saturday night. Park’s 
goal came nine minutes into the 
first overtime period and evened 
CMU’s UAA record at 1-1. It was 
his third goal of the season.
First-year goalkeeper Matthew 
Bazin made two clutch saves in 
the final minutes of the Tartans’ 
win over Washington University 
to preserve the shut-out victory.

CLUBSPORTS
Baseball
First-year Jon Coens pitched 
a dominant first game, leading 
the Tartans to a 3-1 victory and 
a split versus Penn State-Beaver. 
Coens threw seven strong in­
nings, allowing only one run and 
five hits. In the second game, 
junior Doug Peters pitched well, 
allowing four runs over five and 
one-third innings, but took a loss, 
as the Tartans fell 7-2.
In the first game, Peters’ two- 
run single was the difference- 
maker, breaking a 1-1 tie in the 
4th. After that, Coens shut the
door, allowing only one baserun- 
ner over the next three innings. 
He threw only 64 pitches in the 
game, and was so efficient that, 
after Peters left with some numb­
ness in his hand, Coens returned 
to finish the second game. He 
allowed three unearned runs and 
an inherited runner to score.
In the second game, sopho­
more catcher Ryan Comes’ RBI 
double was the main offense, as 
the Tartans struggled with too 
many infield pop-ups.
Coach Claudio Reilsono 
summed up the day, saying, “Our 
bats woke up a little in Game 1.
We were more aggressive and did 
not hit as many easy pop flies as 
we have in previous games.” 
Reilsono said that Coens also 
played well: “I could not ask for 
anything more from Jon. He is 
our ace pitcher and he’s earned 
that title.”
The second game was not in 
their favor, however. Reilsono 
said, “There were some dinky 
little hits along with balls that 
had eyes. Still, I was happy with 
our effort. We play hard, we keep 
coming at you, we are aggressive 
and it’s only going to get better.” 
CMU plays next against Boyce.
Bazin has given up just one goal 
in eight games as the starting 
keeper and is 6-1-1 on the year.
Women’s soccer — Junior mid­
fielder Lisa Pascoli scored the 
lone goal in the Tartans’ 1-0 vic­
tory over Washington. The score 
came on a penalty kick after Erica 
Lacount was tripped in the box 
in the 40th minute. The goal is 
Pascoli’s second of the year.File Photo

Elizabethtown talks
Our interview with director Cameron Crowe
Cameron Crowe has a few good movies 
under his belt, to say the least. His films 
have revolved around a high-powered 
sports agent, a teen tagging along behind 
a band, and a magazine owner who 
becomes trapped in a mask. Now he takes 
on something a little more down-to-earth. 
Almost.
Elizabethtown, Crowe’s next film, will 
hit the big screen this Friday. This story 
follows a slightly less exciting character 
than those in Jerry Maguire or Almost 
Famous. Orlando Bloom plays Drew 
Baylor, a failed shoe designer who returns 
to small-town Kentucky after his father 
dies. Drew is suicidal after being fired and 
dumped almost simultaneously before he 
makes the trek home.
Crowe is pretty familiar with the formula 
of “young man with everything loses 
everything and finds love, peace along 
the road to recovery.” Will it work for him 
again?
The Tartan got a rare opportunity to join 
a number of other small publications in 
a conference-style interview of Crowe. 
Of course, we jumped at the chance to 
ask a few questions and hear about the 
upcoming film.
One thing that Crowe has become known 
for is the use of music in all of his films. 
Almost Famous revolved around music 
and the aspirations of a teen writer. Of the 
music in his work, Crowe said, “Loving 
music is constantly valuable to me.” He 
added that music played a special role in 
Elizabethtown. “Music sort of serves as 
the voice of the dead father... which gave 
voice to a dead character.”
Elizabethtown has a personal connection 
to Crowe. When Crowe was asked what 
inspired him to make the film, he replied, 
“Elizabethtown is a tribute to my dad and 
is somewhat of a love letter to his home 
state, Kentucky.... Generally the stuff that 
comes from your heart is the stuff that 
most people find is universally true.”
We also asked him about the overarching 
trend in his films: A young sensitive
man experiences a fall from grace and 
then reconciles with it through love. He 
laughed and said, “Not my next one.” 
Crowe continued, “I look at it as a revisit 
to a character [who is] kind of a warrior 
for optimism. And I think that’s a hero, 
now.... I wanted to write a character like 
that one more time.”
But, we protested, Orlando Bloom has 
generally been cast with a sword or a bow, 
fighting and clubbing his way to the top
— not as a sensitive shoe creator. Why did 
Cameron cast Bloom as Drew Baylor? “I 
liked that he was surprising in the way he 
dealt with some of those things like failure 
and feelings of suicide. I liked that he kind 
of masked the obvious side of that. [But] 
if you looked in his eyes, it was there.”
“He also worked well with the music I 
wanted to use,” Crow added. “And I didn’t 
want to go with somebody who played 
a version of a young man in a quest for 
emotional depth before.”
Cameron Crowe has gotten a fair amount 
of recognition as a writer and director. 
After all, “Show me the money,” a phrase 
from Jerry Maguire, was on everyone’s 
lips in the late ’90s.
Whether Elizabethtown will succeed or 
not with the general public is uncertain, 
but we predict Crowe’s good humor and 
passion for the personal elements in every 
story will shine through and carry him to 
more projects, even if the film flops.

Lysistrata was the play of the day at the College of Fine Arts. Yes, history repeats

group dancing,” the Tartan reported. Looks like CFA is stuck in the past, but we’re

Carsickness came to Carnegie Mellon! Yes, Carsickness! Not sea-sickness, 
homesickness, or “I just ate at Schatz”-sickness. Carsickness, in fact, was a band 
who performed with The Five and Black Market Baby. The Tartan was pretty kind to 
the band: “While occasional songs suffered from a lack of organization, Carsickness 
displayed true talent that could one day carry them very far.” Do you know how 
they’d get there? In cars! Here in my car, I can go very far. Yes, terrible joke, I’m 
aware.

“Video games lend hours of entertainment, violence too,” The Tartan proclaimed in

Hillary Clinton’s work on health care: “She gets a total bum rap on this,” Clinton

Professorship, Research, and Guns
Preston Covey speaks as an old professor with an innovative teaching style
Preston Covey wheeled himself into his office, then made 
his way to his desk chair. The office had high shelves full 
of books, mostly concerning guns. On one shelf devoid of 
reading material he had perhaps as many as 40 pipes, one 
of which he lit a few minutes after he entered the room.
Covey is a fully sworn deputy who has overseen training 
in firearms for the Sheriffs Reserve of Allegheny County. 
He has had over 600 hours of deadly force training. He 
has co-authored and edited an official document for law 
enforcement firearms instructors.
But to the students of Carnegie Mellon, Covey is a 
philosophy professor. He has been at Carnegie Mellon 
for over 30 years, and he taught the current provost, 
Mark Kamlet, when Kamlet was a student here. Covey 
has accomplished many things in academia and beyond, 
including publishing work on gun control and training 
officers for Team One Network, a group devoted to police 
officer survival. And Covey’s many achievements have 
been completed with the use of only his left arm — his 
right arm has been useless since he was 11 years old, due 
to polio. Later in life, post-polio syndrome caused him 
to lose most of the functionality of his legs as well. He is 
well aware of the fact that students are interested in their 
professors on a more personal level. As he explained, 
“You want to know who the schmuck is that is standing 
up there. You should know who that schmuck is. You 
should just know it and then you will know whether 
it makes a difference to you or not.” About his own 
disabilities, he recognizes the fact that “People are 
going to be curious. I’m curious too, about people with 
disabilities.”
As part of his open attitude, Covey is not shy about his 
struggle with his “foul mouth.” He has even allowed his 
students to monitor his use of the F-word, telling his 
students: “You get a dollar for every time you catch me 
out using the F-word, not mentioning it.” Covey noted 
that it counts only as a “mention” if he quotes someone 
who said the F-word. Students only earn their dollar if he 
uses the F-word himself.
When asked what he thinks makes him stand out most 
from his colleagues Covey replied, “One thing that 
distinguishes me from my eminent colleagues is my foul 
mouth. And two, I’m not shy of using it. I’m not afraid 
of nobody and I’ll use my foul mouth, not my guns. I’ve 
got an arsenal of guns bigger than the National Guard ... 
but know I will use my foul mouth and whatever parts 
of persuasion or argument that are at my call from 
philosophy.” He chuckled, after a moment of deliberation, 
“I think those are two things that would distinguish me. 
I’m not proud of those two things, but I think they would 
distinguish me.”
Courtesy of Denise Troll Covey
Professor Covey discusses his career at his home.
Yes, Covey has quite a few guns. His collection includes 
a federally licensed submachine gun, some assault rifles, 
and a Glock that he received in place of a ring when he 
married his wife, Denise Troll Covey. When his colleagues 
first discovered that he had guns they were taken aback, 
and Covey said he began to think about the issue of 
firearms in general. He explains what he was thinking 
at the time: “I totally understand why people are uptight 
about people, even people they know, having guns. What 
I really need to do is look into this, the gun control issue. 
And while I’m at it, I think I should get some training.” 
Hence, 600 hours of deadly force firearms training. When 
asked if he faces fire now for his feelings on gun control, 
he said, “The answer is no. And the reason is because my 
colleagues from bottom to top here at Carnegie Mellon 
really are intellectually honest and tolerant.”
Covey admits he cannot be sure of how his students 
feel about his self-proclaimed status as “a gunnie.” He 
speculates that, “They’re intrigued by it, perhaps put off 
by it, but intrigued, and they want to know more. Which is
what I would wish my effect on my students to be. Whatever 
kind of clown I come off as being, I would wish that the 
effect on my students as being they want to know more. 
Wonder begins inquiry and if they are wondering about 
me, well maybe they’ll sit still long enough for the videos 
and the readings [that allow them to] dig into the issue.”
Do the students with whom Covey works with believe 
that his opinions will affect their grades? They shouldn’t. 
“Do not worry about whether you agree with me or I 
agree with you, because it’s totally irrelevant,” Covey 
emphasized. He added, “A good teacher, a pedagogue, 
should always be thinking about ‘What is my image to my 
students, how am I coming across to them?’ ”
Covey has a particular desire to help his students that goes 
beyond invoking wonder about the more controversial 
parts of his studies. “The students ought to know that 
there’s someone they can go to, like the priest at the 
corner church when they’re like, ‘I don’t know what to 
do with this problem.’ Well, they ought to know there’s 
someone you can go to,” Covey said. With over 50 advisees 
of his own, Covey declares he’s got a pretty bogged down 
schedule. “I’m like the old woman who lived in the shoe,” 
he said with a smile, “who had so many children, she 
didn’t know what to do.”
If one thing seems central to Covey’s feelings on the 
study of philosophy, it’s accountability: “What does 
philosophy ask of any of us? Simple: account for yourself, 
account for what you believe, account for reasons why you 
believe it. Period.” As for ethics as a subset of philosophy, 
he said, “Philosophy is about accountability and ethics is 
about accountability for the messiest of human problems. 
How do you know and, holy damn, how would you try to 
prove it?”
Covey has spent most of his life trying to answer those 
“messy” problems of ethics and philosophy. And when 
he is not researching issues such as gun control, he is 
teaching the students of Carnegie Mellon about the 
principles of ethics and philosophy. Speaking of what 
led him to what he is currently working on, he said, “I’m 
dedicated to certain principles, and from those principles 
of my experience I generated what I’m doing now....I care 
about my students and I care about my colleagues, and I 
care about my University.”

Lysistrata’s sexual themes put women in charge
A preview of Aristophanes’ masterpeice at Purnell
Lysistrata is playing in Purnell’s 
Chosky Theater from October 11 
to 15.

On Tuesday night, a select few had the privilege of watch­
ing the dress rehearsal of the drama department’s ren­
dition of Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. Directed by Jed Allen 
Harris, the play presented a contemporary interpretation 
of the fifth-century-BCE anti-war work.
Lysistrata, the beacon of feminist sentiment and anti-war 
pride, is played by Susan Goodwillie. She is joined by 
a cast of fellow scheming women and a cluster of male 
counterparts. The “original ‘Make Love, Not War’ play,” 
Harris’ Lysistrata humorously explores what happens 
when several Athenian and Spartan women withhold 
sex from their men in an attempt to get a never-ending 
war to finally cease. It is while the men are pining for the 
females’ attention that both the comedy and idea of the 
absurdity of war are born.
“What keeps us apart, and what draws us together?” That 
question, posed by Science and Humanities Scholars di­
rector William Alba, at a symposium on Lysistrata last 
Sunday, describes the main theme of the play. Yes: The
work is sassy. It is audacious. It is filled to the brim with 
sexual innuendo, hilariously keeping the audience on the 
edge of its seat.
However, all of these things are secondary to the idea 
that it exposes the shared humanity between two feud­
ing city-states. But how is this shown? Sex. The women 
wage a psychological war of their own — and they do it 
by taking over the Athenian Acropolis and withholding 
sexual gratification from the savage local men. Oh, and 
have no fear, Harris holds nothing back: passion-charged 
discourse? Check. Props made to look like unmention­
ables? Definitely check.
If performances are half as good as the dress rehearsal 
was, audience members are in for a treat. Goodwillie 
takes control of the stage and works well with the audi­
ence, playing off both its silence and laughter. The chorus 
of men (Andrew Kober, Michael Strassheim, and Tim Wil­
son) and the chorus of women (Whitton Frank, Marissa 
Lesch, and Pa’Tina Miller) remind the audience just how
When asked what he hopes people 
take away from Lysistrata, all di­
rector Jed Harris had to say was, 
“I hope they walk away thinking 
— thinking with a smile on their 
face.”
Lysistrata, playing October 11-15, 
explores what would happen if 
women refused to have sex with 
men in an attempt to end a war. 
This play was written over 2000 
years ago by Aristophanes, but 
remains applicable and humer- 
ous in current day.

talented the students of Carnegie Mellon’s drama school 
really are.
While simultaneously maintaining eye contact with the 
audience and providing narrative background singing, 
the chorus draws the audience into the play in a way that 
makes everyone feel like they are standing on the steps 
of the Acropolis. Or maybe it’s the costumes — design 
majors and fashion fanatics campus -wide will fawn over 
the delicately layered chiffon of the ragged dresses.
But the most memorable characteristic of the acting 
is the difference in the accents between Athenians and 
Spartans. While this version is based on the Douglass 
Parker translation of the play, director Harris says that 
across most translations, the quality of accent “is used to 
differentiate between the Athenians and the Spartans.” 
“Athenians,” he says, “thought of themselves as more so­
phisticated than the Spartans,” and Athens was actually 
physically located north of Sparta. Therefore, the actors 
are humorously portrayed as having extremely southern 
or “country” accents as Spartans 
and vivacious New York accents 
as Athenians.

Underground jazz
An exploration of the jazz bands performing at Carnegie Mellon
Mingwei Tay/Photo Staff
Bassist Paul Thompson, also of the Brazilian jazz group Salsamba, performed 
with Thoth Trio on Saturday.
Once called “devil’s music,” jazz has now become a widely 
accepted form of music around the world. In fact, Carnegie 
Mellon students have the good fortune of Pittsburgh’s being 
a nurturing home to jazz musicians. In the past two weeks, 
Carnegie Mellon students were treated to two fabulous jazz 
concerts at the Underground.
Last Sunday, students packed the Underground to see CMU 
director of jazz studies and renowned bassist Dave Pellow 
perform with guitar legend Jimmy Ponder, trumpeter Eddie 
Allen, and drummer Greg Bandy. The band’s mellow sound 
attracted many kids to come down with laptops and notebooks 
to study and listen to the quartet in the background. The group 
jammed on standards such as “Autumn Leaves,” “Body and 
Soul,” and John Coltrane’s “Mr. PC,” as well as classic 12-bar 
shuffle-blues progressions, reminiscent of blues guitar legends 
such as Muddy Waters and B.B. King.
Ponder, the band leader, would often guide the group through 
each tune, beginning with a smooth, lengthy guitar introduction, 
and, with a broad smile on his face, ending the tune with “All 
right, stop, that’s it!” The group gladly played along, each 
member taking a solo of his own before passing the ball along 
to the next soloist.
Pellow, who both conducts jazz bands and privately teaches 
students at CMU, often encourages his students to get involved 
in playing jazz outside of the jazz band. On Sunday night, Pellow
BRENT MICKUM
The Underground, although only half-filled on Saturday night, 
was still pulsating with energy. The group would often play tunes 
with no chord progression, allowing room for heavy drumming 
and syncopated bass lines. Whereas the Ponder Quartet relied 
heavily on jazz standards, Thoth Trio played primarily original 
compositions. Not yet in their forties, the members of Thoth Trio 
— still merely beginners in the world of jazz — have a bright 
future ahead of them as a group and as individual musicians.
George Brent Mickum IV is a senior partner in the Washington, 
DC law firm Keller & Heckman, working in the litigation 
division. Through the Center for Constitutional Rights, he is the 
U.S. attorney for a number of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba, and has helped obtain the release of some of his clients.
Prior to his work at Keller & Heckman and tor CCR, Mickum 
was a trial attorney with the Federal Trade Commission, and a 
Special United States Attorney with the Department of Justice.
Mickum discusses the conditions under which detainees are 
apprehended and detained, often without charge, either at Guan­
tanamo or in prisons of countries where they have been 
'‘rendered” for torture and interrogation. An eloquent defender 
of constitutional and human rights, he describes how many of 
the most basic rights of due process and fair trial are denied to 
detainees facing tribunals.
invited CMU’s own Joe Etzine (’09) to play guitar on Charlie 
Parker’s “Donna Lee,” and for the group’s last number, Matt 
Merewitz (’06) came up and jammed on Miles Davis’ whirlwind 
swing number, “Milestones.”
This past Saturday, students had the treat of seeing jazz played 
in the more contemporary style of Thoth Trio. Whereas kids 
were able to work and listen to the Jimmy Ponder Quartet in 
the background, Thoth Trio required much more focused 
listening. Composed of CMU alumnus Ben Opie on saxophones 
and clarinet, bassist Paul Thompson, and drummer Dave 
Throckmorton, the group was focused less on individual 
performances and conventional jazz grooves, and more on 
group improvisation.
and appreciated by fans all over the world. Maybe one day, jazz 
aficionados will have the treat of seeing Thoth Trio and the 
Jimmy Ponder Quartet headlining Spring Carnival.

Although jazz may never be as popular as rock ’n’ roll, it was 
still a pleasure to see kids and adults come out to support one 
of the most intellectually and creatively stimulating art forms 
on the market today. Jazz continues to be studied, performed,
Carnegie Mellon alumnus Ben Opie played the saxophones and clarinet 
at Saturday night’s performance at the Underground.

Fall fashion
on campus.
The philosophy behind this years’ major trends
It’s the singular strand of pearls, the Ramones tee with 
the starch mark down the center, the $70 pair of tousled 
red leather pumps. It’s fashion, and it exists even on 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus. Clothing, jewelry, attitude
— that’s what defines it. Students today combine distinct 
aspects of pop culture to create their own definitive, 
unique personalities.
But as part of the so-called “elite” educational subculture 
that is Carnegie Mellon, we should learn to look past 
these pre-planned ideas to maintain control over our 
own personal outward appearances. Ask yourself what 
college would be like if looks weren’t everything and find 
that point where individuality becomes superficial in a 
culture.
Ironically, as we sit here, decked out in factory-bleached 
denim, we risk becoming mindless clothing stereotypes. 
Maybe it’s the fast-paced eccentricity that defines 
our generation, or the constant struggle for personal 
reputation advancement that shadows our very dear 
Carnegie Mellon community. Have we lost our ability to 
assimilate true personality with pop culture? Maybe it’s 
just our rapidly changing world, which has fostered an 
environment solely suitable for superficiality. And that’s
Enter the “Vintage Tee”: where urban sophistication 
underscores pop culture clothing. This is what you see 
every day — to your left it’s in the form of a navy blue 
tank top, casually ripped along the bottom hem. Look to 
your right and it’s a student in a faded white camisole in 
line to pick up her mail. But why? Have you questioned 
the reason it’s worn? I don’t hate the tears or the inverted 
seams — they’re symbolic of our urban lifestyle — but 
why not delve into, no, tear the concept apart?

Destroyed denim is an expensive vintage wannabe.
Casual sophistication. In fact, it was the tagline for spring 
apparel at Abercrombie & Fitch this year. The Vintage Tee 
shapes this concept: No longer do you have to simply don 
a generic sleeveless top or nameless pair of denims. Now, 
everything is unique! And it isn’t necessary to maintain a 
restricted, homogeneous image pre-made by the classic 
fashion moguls — dare I call out Tommy and Ralph? 
At least, this is what we are told by the Vintage Tee. 
Wearing it, we are automatically “relaxed” and are able 
to somehow ironically claim that we have escaped this 
very “Retro-Glam” trend (i.e., the glamorization of older 
clothing). Just walking to my class on cultural resistance 
yesterday, I heard a pre-made vintage-clad kid boasting, 
“I pulled this, wrinkled, from the back of my dad’s closet,” 
as he contemptuously eyed his friends, who lacked such 
ingenious initiative.
I don’t want you to backlash against every CMU-er who 
sports pre-fabricated vintage attire. In fact, I’d encourage 
you to get out and smell the roses (or at least the over­
processed coffee). We all buy into the dominant culture, 
and there is nothing wrong with that. I will not lie: I am 
sitting here with a long strand of pearls hanging around 
my neck. And the holes in my jeans? Okay, fine — one 
came that way. My intent is to ask you: How will you use 
our vintage-clad, educationally elite subculture to your 
advantage, and use style to be your own language?

okay. But who — or what—then draws the line between 
a unique approach to practicality and adherence to a 
cultural rebellion cult?
So why uncover this irony? It’s hardly worth being cynical 
about. What do we do with it at Carnegie Mellon? Well, 
we live it — we are urban-dwellers. We layer, we mix, we 
match. But be careful: Was it your own idea to put that 
wrinkled shirt over those ripped leggings?

Crocheted sweaters are making a comeback this year.
While teens all over, then, yearn for individuality, what 
happens when the dreaded, “uber-preppie” Abercrombie
& Fitch company begins to mass-produce these pre­
wrinkled, pre-faded, almost pre-worn vintage tees? What 
does it mean when those claiming to be relaxed and 
individual in their old, worn-out tees find themselves 
scratching at the exposed Abercrombie & Fitch tag itching 
their neck?

Craig’s brilliant creation
Craigslist.orghas become one of the nation’s best community-building websites
Craig Newark is a single 53-year-old computer 
nerd who just might help you find your next 
apartment, boyfriend, or car. What began in 
1995 as an e-mail list for San Franciscans in 
search of love, a job, or a house has expanded 
to a multi-million dollar enterprise that reaches 
from the Bay Area all the way to Bangkok. The 
perfect site for college students, Craigslist 
(www.craigslist.org) is a blend of eBay, 
Facebook, and online blogs, and it’s working 
around the clock to connect communities all 
over the country.
Pittsburgh Portal
Like many cities around the world, Pittsburgh 
has its own section on the site. Although not as 
built-up as the San Francisco or New York City 
sections, the Pittsburgh section is growing. 
Like the rest of the site, the Pittsburgh part 
of Craigslist allows visitors to scan through 
sale advertisements, housing offers, and 
personal advertisements for potential 
romantic partners — all at no cost. Before 
you find something or someone that you are 
interested in, the sellers’ postings on personal 
advertisements and individual sale items can 
remain anonymous. However, when buyers 
are interested in a request or offer, they can 
begin to exchange information with sellers via 
e-mail. Similar to eBay’s trading policy, the site 
is only a market and does not directly give out 
individuals’ contact information without their 
consent.
Although the Pittsburgh section of Craigslist 
was not added until November 2003, the site 
has already begun to gain a cultlike following in 
Pittsburgh. Bethany Rutter, a sophomore in the 
College of Humanities and Social Sciences, has 
used Craigslist on several occasions. “Craigslist 
is great considering that it’s so easy to find 
anything you want in Pittsburgh or any other 
city; and where else can you find free stuff, 
cheap stuff, furniture, books, jobs, discussion 
forums, housing, concert tickets, and even 
dates? Nowhere! Rutter has even received a
free television from a local Pittsburgh resident 
on the site earlier this semester.
One of the first things that you will notice about 
Craigslist is the lack of annoying pop-up ads and 
banner ads, because the site is free for all house 
postings (except for listings in San Francisco). 
Another striking feature of the site is its simplistic 
layout. There are no frills; no flashy graphics, no 
innovative designs. Just the information you 
need at your fingertips and the power to connect 
to others in your community.
Geeky Good Guy
Craig is the kind of guy that a Carnegie Mellon 
girl could appreciate: nerdy but nice. In fact, the 
Los Angeles Times reported on June 13, 2004, 
in “The Craigslist Phenomenon” that he “wore 
a pocket protector and black-rimmed glasses, 
taped together” in high school. In the same 
interview with the Times, he later commented 
that “when you grow up a nerd, you feel like 
an outsider. It pretty much always sticks with 
you,” Note to all Carngie Mellon nerds: being an 
outsider might stick with you, but it definitely 
doesn’t have to hold you back.
Craig is introverted, but has a heart much bigger 
than his wallet. He donates money to charities 
on a regular basis and has formed the Craigslist 
Foundation, which allows teachers to request 
school supplies at a discounted price. Although 
the site is no longer a non-profit, Craig’s mission 
of helping others has not changed.
Danielle Saudino/Art Editor
Beyond being a generous guy, Craig refuses to 
be a sell-out to bigger corporations interested 
in buying craigslist.org to capitalize on its 
potential earning power. Forbes magazine 
reported in 2005 that the site brings in an 
estimated $7 million but also estimates that 
Craig only walks away with about $200,000 
a year. As he explained to Wired in September 
2004, “When I think of the money one could 
make from all this, I get a little twinge. But I’m 
pretty happy with nerd values: Get yourself a

comfortable living, then do a little something to change 
the world.”
Craig writes on Craigslist that he originally hoped to call 
the site “sf-events,” but the site’s current name reflects 
just how down-to-Earth this guy really is. He’s definitely 
not about making money; in fact, he only charges for five 
percent of all job postings made on the site and has made 
the site ad-free since 1997.
Community-Building
The site lists its many goals to be “giving each other a 
break; getting the word out about everyday; real-world 
stuff; restoring the human voice to the Internet; in a 
humane; non-commercial environment; keeping things 
simple; common-sense; down-to-earth; honest, very 
real; providing an alternative to impersonal, big-media 
sites;being inclusive; giving a voice to the disenfranchised; 
democratizing; and being a collection of communities 
with similar spirit, not a single 
monolithic entity.”
In a world of monopoly-building 
corporate mergers, shady business 
dealings, and Enron-esque scandals, 
it is definitely rare to see a person 
let alone an entire site dedicated 
to the preservation of “giving each 
other a break.” In May 1995, the San

One of the more sincere man-seeking-woman ads 
currently posted on the Pittsburgh site is a man “looking 
for someone to keep me company once in a while, 
someone who I can depend on as a source of comfort, 
or something like that. Basically, I’ve been feeling a little 
lonely, and would like some company. We can take it from 
there. So e-mail me back if you’re interested, and let’s get 
this thing started.”
If-you’re not looking to head down to the altar just yet, 
there are also those who just want to look cool with 
you by their side. Another Pittsburgh resident currently 
posting on the “strictly platonic” section of the personal 
advertisement section is “looking for someone who wants
Craigslist has grown from one man’s attempt to unite his 
city to an online community. Although Craig has'passed 
on the title of CEO to Jim Buckmaster, 10 million people 
from all over the world continue to use the site each month. 
Craig and his cohorts have managed to keep their goal of 
providing users with “a trustworthy, efficient, relatively 
non-commercial place for folks to find all the basics in 
their local area.” In June 2004, Time magazine reported 
that the site was one of the “50 Coolest Websites,” and in 
April 2000 the Wall Street Journal named Craigslist the 
“#1 most efficient U.S. job site.” Despite this success and 
the financial potential of his creation, Craig has managed 
to remain a normal, down-to-earth guy.
Craig’s creation is especially useful for 
students wishing to voice an opinion, buy 
cheap furniture, or find someone to take 
to a fraternity formal. Sure, Craig Newark 
could be sitting on his own private island, 
drinking a Corona, and lighting his cigars 
with hundred-dollar bills. Instead, he still 
works long hours at his office and probably 
cringes when tax day comes around. 
(Maybe he should post for someone to 
file his tax returns.) But more than being 
a useful site, Craigslist is one of the best 
examples of what happens when people 
refuse to sell out.

Unfortunate victim of box office failure
Even with a good plot and exciting effects, Serenity has not been a financial success
Courtesy of www.uip.nl/Pictures/seren
Serenity picks up from the plot of Firefly.
It’s a damn shame that Serenity hasn’t broken even at 
the box office yet. While this summer was a relatively 
disappointing one in theatres, movies with originality 
still did relatively well. Last weekend, when Serenity 
opened, it was pitted against the Jodie Foster airline 
thriller Flightplan and only made $10 million — a paltry 
sum for an epic sci-fi adventure from an acclaimed writer 
and director.
JossWhedonhasbirthedsomeofthemostpopulartelevision 
shows in the past decade — Buffy the Vampire Slayer, its 
spin-off, Angel, and the cult hit Firefly. Unfortunately, 
the Fox network canceled Firefly in 2002 after not quite
one full season; but after it sold extremely well on DVD, 
Universal picked up the rights to make a film based 
on the series. Whedon signed on as the writer and 
director and the entire original cast of the show returned 
for the movie — a move that was sure to please fans 
everywhere.
But the movie isn’t just for the fans; Whedon’s storytelling 
skill has made Serenity a film that’s enjoyable even when 
it stands purely on its own. Sure, if you haven’t watched 
the show you’ll miss out on a few of the finer points of the 
plot, but the movie is self-contained enough that it’s not 
necessary at all.
The story of the Firefly universe has a fairly generic 
setup. Five hundred years into the future, humankind has 
expanded throughout the galaxy, and the expansion 
has led to civil unrest in the outer planets. The outliers 
haven’t advanced as much as the rest of the galaxy and 
are stuck in a state of living that is very much similar to 
the Wild West — except with spaceships. The Alliance, 
which controls the civilized, advanced, inner colonies, 
is constantly at odds with the splintered factions of the 
Independents, the people fighting for autonomy in the 
outer colonies.
Mai (Nathan Fillion), the captain of the title spacecraft 
fought for the Independents when the dispute was 
a full civil war; however, the Alliance has since won, 
and now Mai has to make ends meet as a ship for 
hire. He and his crew are slowly turning down the 
path of taking more and more illegal jobs just to stay 
afloat. Nevertheless, his crew has stayed at his side
through thick and thin, despite all of their flaws. 
The story of the movie follows the Alliance’s efforts to take 
one of Mai’s crew captive—the young psychic girl named 
River (Summer Glau) who subconsciously knows secrets 
that could threaten the Alliance’s regime. The crew of the 
Serenity has to stay one step ahead of the Alliance’s best 
assassin, a man who simply goes by the nickname “The 
Operative,” to uncover the secret and save River’s life.
If you like science fiction at all, you really should already 
be in line to see this movie. It’s got a compelling story, 
interesting characters, and surprisingly awesome effects. 
The Firefly universe has a gritty aesthetic feel that is very 
unique, and it ends up working extremely well on the 
big screen. There’s a great balance of action, drama, and 
comedy that keeps the pace running fast, and it all comes 
together to make a sci-fi epic that’s way more enjoyable 
than the most recent Star Wars movie. The space battle 
near the climax of the movie is much easier to take in 
than the convoluted battles that George Lucas has grown 
accustomed to using, and that simplicity makes it a great 
deal more entertaining. As an added bonus, seeing the 
waif-like Glau take down every single guy in a bar in one 
of the more elaborate fight scenes is a treat on its own.
It’s a miracle that this movie was made at all — Fox’s 
canceled shows tend to rot away in obscurity no matter 
how good they were. Firefly, though, was destined for 
something bigger. And the big screen is as big as it gets.

This week, our obscure foreign film hails from 
Hungary. It tells the tale of a small town in rural 
Hungary that descends into chaos when a peculiar 
circus interrupts the bleak winter night and people 
from all around come to see a giant stuffed whale 
carcass. The story is part drama and part black 
comedy, and all artsy European filmmaking. Get 
your subtitle-loving on Thursday, and be glad that 
it’s not winter here yet.
Wedding Crashers
lewSsHN gOtdIoe 16 
.(482N12N1)482
This is a movie about men who aren’t afraid to lie to 
get what they want. It doesn’t ever happen in real 
life, of course — men are trustworthy creatures 
who would never do anything except the absolute 
right thing to do. And they certainly wouldn’t take 
advantage of women when their libidos are revved 
up by the prospect of weddings. No sir, never. In 
related news, this movie is extremely wholesome 
and definitely does not include a copious amount 
of naked breasts, swear words, or alcohol. It is, 
however, one of the best movies to come out this 
summer, so go see it and be happy.
Batman Begins
pstTeSsHN gOtdIoe 13 
.(482N12N1)482
You know how Wedding Crashers was one of the 
best movies of the summer? Batman Begins is the 
best. The film, a “franchise reboot” to cleanse the 
proverbial national palate of the terrible aftertaste 
of Joel Schumacher’s dual Batman atrocities, is 
awesome on every level. It’s got great perfor­
mances and great action, plus the absolute coolest 
movie vehicle of all time: the new Batmobile. Also, 
Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy steal the show 
and generate two extremely memorable perfor­
mances — impressive for a comic book movie. Do 
yourself a favor and set aside two and a half hours 
on Saturday to go partake of this great movie.

This Colombian film was nominated for an Oscar 
and dozens of other awards, and won a bunch of 
them too. It’s about a pregnant teenage girl who 
becomes a drug runner to raise money for her 
family, a commendable and terrifying choice, and 
one whose gravity this film conveys amazingly 
well. It’s all in Spanish, so you’ll have to be paying 
attention — but on the plus side, you’ll learn the 
Spanish word for “heroin,” and you never know 
when that’ll come in handy.
