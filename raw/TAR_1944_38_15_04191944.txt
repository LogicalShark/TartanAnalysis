Tabor, Farmer, Speak 
For Carnegie Tech’s 
Graduation Exercises
Two eminent Pittsburghers will 
be the speakers at the Commence­
ment and Baccalaureate Programs. 
Dr. William R. Farmer, Chaplain at 
the University of Pittsburgh, will 
deliver the Baccalaureate address, 
and Attorney Edward Tabor will 
speak to the Seniors at the Com­
mencement Program.
Dr. Farmer, commencement speaker
Dr. Farmer was born in New York 
on June 19, 1867. He attended Wash­
ington and Jefferson College and the 
Western Theological Seminary of 
Pittsburgh. He also did post-gradu­
ate work at the University of Bar- 
burg, Germany. He is ordained a 
Presbyterian minister. He was pas-

The Carnegie campus will bid 
goodby to its thirty-ninth graduat­
ing class the week-end of the twen­
ty-ninth and thirtieth of April when 
Baccalaureate Services and Com­
mencement exercises will be held 
for the first class of ’44 in the Little 
Theater and Carnegie Music Hall. 
Two noted Pittsburghers, Dr. William 
R. Farmer, Chaplain at the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh; and Edward Ta­
bor, attorney at law, will speak at 
the two services. The usual festive 
gaiety associated with graduation 
will be somewhat curtailed this year 
in keeping with the war-time gloom 
on campus. There will be no Senior 
Ball, but there will be a tea in honor 
of the graduating class given by 
Dean Daniels, Dean Yon, and Dean 
Murphy in the Carnegie Union on 
Saturday, April 29.
The Little Theater in the Fine 
Arts Building will be the scene of 
the Baccalaureate Services for the 
first time this year. The program 
given on the evening of the 29th of 
April at 8:00 o’clock will conclude 
the traditional singing of Wesley’s 
arrangement of “Come Thou Al­
mighty King,” and “America” by

Dr. H. C. Hicks Dies 
Following Short Illness
Dr. Hervey C. Hicks, 42, assistant 
professor of mathematics at Car­
negie Institute of Technology, died 
at noon Friday (April 14) in St. 
Francis Hospital after an illness of 
less than two weeks. He had been 
on leave of absence from Carnegie 
Tech since January 30 assisting in 
the inauguration of a Ballistics Re­
search Laboratory at Aberdeen 
Proving Ground, Maryland.
Dr. Hicks came to Carnegie Tech 
in 1930. A native of Chicago, he had 
attended the University of Califor­
nia and the University of Chicago, 
receiving the Ph. B. and Master of 
Science degrees from the latter in­
stitution. The Ph. D. was conferred 
on him in 1928 by California In­
stitute of Technology where he held 
a fellowship in mathematics and 
aeronautics. He taught at Brown 
University, the University of Ore­
gon, and Texas Technological Col­
lege before joining the Carnegie 
Tech faculty.
He took part in activities of the 
faculty, serving recently as chair­
man of the executive committee of . 
the faculty and chairman of the su­
pervisory committee of the Car­
negie Tech Credit Union. He was a 
member of the Mathematical Asso­
ciation of America, the American 
Mathematical Society, American 
Physical Society, and Sigma Xi, na­
tional research honorary.
He leaves his wife, Ruth Kasten 
Hicks, and three children, Vinnie, 
Ruth, and Hervey C. Hicks, Jr.
Martha Sant Triumphs 
In Sub-Deb Contest
Carnegie Tech’s Costume Eco­
nomics Department has received 
national renown due to the talent of 
Martha Sant. Last week the good 
news leaked out that Martha had 
won first prize in the National Sub- 
deb Dress Design Contest conducted 
by the Ladies’ Home Journal. The 
winning dress is a rose-colored 
chambray, distinguished by its 
beautiful detail work in trimming 
and technique. The unusual saw­
tooth scallop that edges the neck 
goes across the yoke and down the 
side. It is rich, but simple, and the 
bound button holes are indications 
of Martha’s skill.
It is a special honor for Martha to 
have won the Pittsburgh contest — 
even that was a thrill, but to top 
thousands in the National Contest 
has left her breathless. And no won­
der, for this weekend she left for 
a three-day trip to New York, all 
expenses paid, plus $25 for incident­
als and a $100 United States War 
Bond.
Martha Sant is a graduate of 
Westinghouse High School, and the 
recipient of the Pittsburgh Home 
Economics Scholarship for Car­
negie Tech. She is a sophomore in 
the Teacher’s Training Group of 
Home Economics. Her instructor, 
Miss Doris Meyers, has said, “Mar­
tha is the kind of student who will 
go to. any amount of effort to make 
the most of a problem.”

Seniors Will Follow 
Eleven-Week Schedule
After prompt action by the Cur­
riculum Committee of the College 
of Engineering, the Educational 
Senate, and the Executive Board, 
Director Jones and Dr. Work an­
nounced last Friday afternoon at a 
special assembly for all students in 
the class of August, 1944, that all 
these students would be able to 
graduate on June 30, 1944, and thus 
qualify for deferments for students 
graduating before July 1, 1944.
Under the new plan, the seventh 
semester for these Seniors ended on 
Friday, April 14, and their eighth 
and last semester began Monday 
with registration in the department­
al offices, while regular classes start­
ed Tuesday morning. The Seniors 
special eleven-week schedule calls 
for 66 units of work, which will 
probably require a six-day week, 
and classes from eight o’clock on, 
and on some evenings. The semes­
ter will end on June 30, and com­
mencement exercises will be on 
July 1 or 2 in the Little Theatre.
In their addresses to the Seniors, 
both Director Jones and Dr. Work 
emphatically stated that the de­
grees which the students will re­
ceive after this super expedited pro-
crram will not hp war Twoewwmi but
Nice fashions, eh?

Comprised of four scenes pertain- 
ihg to a circus theme, the show 
opened with a display of cotton 
charmers, entitled “Cotton Rides a 
High Horse ... on a merry-go- 
round of fashion.” Wearing the 
dainty playthings were Evelyn 
Mikus, Samantha Simpson, Virginia 
Mulholland, Josephine Sunseri, and 
Cecily Nicely. Following in order 
came “Prints Charming . . . for 
the queen of the carnival,” demon­
strating well-styled printed mate­
rials. Wearing these, with acces­
sories supplied by Kaufmann’s, were

the exact equivalent of any peace 
time diploma. Since its foundation, 
the Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy has never given a degree to any­
one who has not complied with all 
the requirements and standards set 
by the school and the various de­
partments, and in spite of the great 
pressure imposed by the pres­
ent conditions, the Institute will not 
deviate from this policy. The de­
grees which will be given on June 
30 are as good as any other ever 
given at this school, if not better.
Notice
There will be an important 
meeting of the Tartan staff Fri­
day, April 21, at five o’clock, in 
the publications office. ¦

Good-Bye And Good Luck
Partir, c’est mourir un peu—to part is :to die a little. The next two weeks 
will be sad ones for all of us, for they will mark the exodus of a large majority 
of the Carnegie Tech student body: The seniors graduating on April 29, and 
the many boys from all classes who have been called into the armed services.
What can one say to a friend who is leaving? Mumbled, meaningless
bromides: “Nice to have known you; best of luck,” forced, half-hearted jokes, 
an embarrassed silence, the last handshake, and he has gone. And then, too 
late, one remembers suddenly all the things one had wanted to say.
Writing a farewell editorial is even worse. What can we write but empty 
phrases, and stupid, stereotyped sentiments? We can tell the graduating girls 
of M.M.C.C. and Fine Arts that we wish them good luck in their future career, 
a happy life, and sooner or later a good husband. We can try to tell them 
how much everyone shall miss them, and that we would like to see them again 
as often as possible.
There is so much more that should be said, and so much less that can be 
said to the boys who, before long, will be in uniform. Of course we wish them 
all the luck in the world, of course we fervently hope to reunite with them as 
soon as possible. But how can we put into words our gratitude for what they 
are going to do for us, our sorrow at their leaving, otif prayers for their safe 
return? How can we express our feelings when we shall look at that empty 
seat in lecture, or that empty bed in the fraternity house!
It is impossible, and we shall not attempt to do it. To all of you who are 
leaving, therefore, just au revoir, and a strong handshake.
Orchids to The Administration
The administration was put to a test, and it has passed it magnificently. 
Breaking all precedents, impervious to the complicated and tedious work it 
would have to face, it managed in an exceedingly short time to plan and set 
into operation the super-expedited Senior program.
Strictly speaking, this emergency measure is not perfect. For all seniors 
it will mean more work than ever before, for some even too much. A few who 
were assured 4F or other deferments until August may be unable to carry this, 
for them, unnecessarily hard load, and many others will have to forget about 
double degrees and extra courses. But in view of the extraordinary circum­
stances—relatively speaking—this program is the only good solution to our 
problem, for it will do the greatest good to the greatest number of people. 
Scorning the easy way out, refusing to sit by while students were drafted at 
the very end of their undergraduate years, the administration has thus enabled 
tnost of the seniors to receive their degree before leaving for the armed forces.
And the administration has done even more than that. In spite of the tre­
mendous pressure imposed by the present conditions, it has not yielded to the 
temptations which many other colleges were unable to withstand—in spite of 
everything no war degree will ever be issued from this Institute. Carnegie 
Tech has made its name in a very few years, and is now at the very top of the 
American engineering colleges. It is determined to stay there, come what may, 
and it refuses to lower its standards by issuing cheap degrees.
We are very grateful to :tfae administration for all it has done. But at this 
time, kjiowing that our debt to Director Jones, Dr. Work, and their immediate 
associates cannot be expressed in words, we would just like to thank Director 
Jones’ staff, the people behind the scenes; Misses Hartman, Gass, De Maria, and 
Parker, who have spent endless hours of overtime filling out hundreds of white, 
pink, and green deferment applications.
Opinions expressed, in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the ttaff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

Staggering from one blow after 
another, and struggling to maintain 
her savoir faire at all cost, Carnegie 
Tech approaches her Gethsemane. 
With the ruthlessness of war ravag­
ing her very being, she approaches 
her decisive hours. It was not 
enough that the Army program had 
to be curtailed—the ravenous ap­
petite of the cannon now demands 
the civilian. The future of Tech is 
dark, but it is far from hopeless. 
This is a war for existence, and in 
such astruggle, one gives what he 
has—be it great or small.
To those who must now go to fill 
the ranks of fighting men — sans 
peur et sans reproche—we can but 
offer our own limited store of advice 
and the best of wishes. We offer to 
them a little of the “savvy” which 
comes only through the bitter school 
of experience. We tender, for ex­
ample, the definite No. 1 rule of 
never volunteering, the trick of 
dusting ventilators on Friday even­
ings, and the gamble of going to 
mess after the rest of the company 
and taking the chance of thereby 
drawing a large portion. These are 
only a few pointers; the majority 
must be learned the hard way.
To those who must leave and 
stand against the forces of night, 
there may come a taste of bitter dis­
illusionment. For, as they look back 
on the events of the past year, they 
cannot help but wonder if, had they 
been in the Army a year ago, they 
might now not be studying at Tech 
in O. D. That, of course, is not an 
innuendo, it is merely a thought 
which has occurred to many. It is 
analogous, perhaps, to trying to
finesse a jack and discovering your 
victim with king-queen. War cre­
ates many strange circumstances, 
and their apparent paradox is sim­
ply another in a long chain of in­
comprehensible events. Familiarity 
with the uncertainties of military 
life will reinforce your spirit of de­
mocracy—and tolerance, and build 
a foundation not to be eroded by the 
passing of years.
In all that may seem lost, how­
ever, there is much of goodness. For 
one, the tension under which work 
at Tech has been done will no longer 
exist. The mind will be free from all 
but the most essential strain. For 
another, the realization that, final­
ly, you are giving your bit directly 
to the winning of the war will be 
uppermost in your thoughts. As 
Saroyan says. “. . . Seek goodness 
everywhere, and when it is found, 
bring it out of its hiding-place and 
let it be free and unashamed. Place 
in matter and in flesh the least of 
the values, for these are the things 
that hold death and must pass 
away ... Be the inferior of no 
man, nor of any man be the su­
perior. Remember that every man 
is a variation of yourself . . . Have 
no shame in being kindly and gen­
tle, but if the time comes ... to 
kill, kill and have no regret ...”
To those who now go forward to 
meet the brutalities and horrors of 
this decade, we extend our hand. To 
become melodramatic is stupid; 
civilization is past that stage. We 
realize, we think, what this means 
to many of you; it has happened to 
as many of us. Each gives what 
he has, and if that fails — what 
sense the world?
Letters To The Editor
Dear Editor:
Concerning Mr. Caplan’s irate let­
ter in the Tartan today:
Mr. Caplan is obviously not ac­
quainted with the facts or else the 
facts have been misrepresented to 
him.
It is quite true that Drama stu­
dents can hardly ever attend school 
dances. It is equally true that peo­
ple have to be sometimes called at 
their home in order to make sure 
they will come to rehearsal. This 
last, however, is only necessary 
with people who are irresponsible 
and disinterested enough not to 
come when they have been asked to 
come, thus holding up the whole 
¡rehearsal.
I am aware of the fact that there 
are certain people in our depart­
ment who resent not being able to 
participate in social affairs because 
of rehearsal or crew, but these peo­
ple simply do not belong in the the­
ater. TTiey would be much happier 
in a liberal arts school where they 
have enough leisure to get the full 
value out of extra-curricular activ­
ities, social or otherwise. Anyone 
who is working in the theater in 
any capacity has to sacrifice most 
other activities. Most of us in the 
Drama Department are interested 
in, and love, the theater enough to 
subordinate almost everything to it. 
Those people in the department who 
cannot do that simply have no place 
in the Drama Department.
As for Mr. Caplan’s statement 
that the Drama Department, should 
be more cooperative, and allow peo­
ple to be absent from rehearsal in 
order to attend a dance—I can only
answer that, for my part, I came to 
this school primarily to learn a pro­
fession, and for no other purpose, 
and I know that that is what most 
of the Drama students are here for.
This is a professional school, and 
we are expected to have a profes­
sional attitude towards our work. 
Those of us who have not had bet­
ter leave this school. They were def­
initely in the wrong place.
With love to the editors and a 
fatherly kiss on Mr. Caplan’s trou­
bled forehead.
Ruth Agathie Sobotka.
Dear Editor,
Aubry’s letter in the Tartan has 
once more raised a cry that has been 
heard ever since the drama depart­
ment has been in existence. As a 
member of the department I should 
like to try and answer Aubry’s out­
burst.
First of all I should like to re­
mind Aubry that although the 
drama department is one of the 
“smaller” parts of this institution, as 
he so aptly put it, it rates as the 
finest drama school in the country. 
This has given us a standard that 
the majority of the department 
wants to live up to. Aubry has said 
that one rehearsal more or less 
should not change the quality of our 
work. That is wrong. Our time is 
limited on all the shows that we 
give. We work on a very close 
schedule and the standard of our 
work depends on keeping to that 
schedule.
Aubrey seems to question the 
school spirit of the dramats. I should

like to ask Aubry to recall former 
dances that he has attended. I 
should like to ask him which de­
partment gave freely of their time 
and talents to putting on a floor 
show for the entertainment of the 
other students and which depart­
ment in previous years worked for 
an entire year and gave up all three 
days of Carnival to put on a musical 
comedy at the Music Hall to make 
Carnival a bigger and better affair 
for everyone. If he thinks about it 
he will find that it’s the drama de­
partment.
Finally I should like to explain to 
Aubry that no one is forced to do 
anything in our department. Per­
haps he doesn’t know that no per­
son is admitted to the department 
without first being informed that 
the work is difficult and the hours 
long and will often interfere with 
outside activities and interests. This 
fact is supposed to be understood 
and accepted by every member of 
the department.
There has never been a time when 
crew or rehearsal has not conflicted 
with a dance or other school affairs, 
but in spite of this a vast majority 
of dramats have attended these 
school functions even though it 
meant going at a late hour. If Au­
bry would cast an eye over the so­
cial life of the department I think he 
will find a very large number of 
dramats who successfully date boys 
outside of the department. We are 
all extremely sorry that Aubry had 
to miss his Carnival date, but I think 
that the next time Aubrey has a 
grievance he should try and under­
stand the situation before he pub­
licly denounces a subject which he 
knows nothing about.
Sincerely,
Jane Pursch, D’44.

Grad. Record Exams Student Employment 
Get Slightly De-Bimked 
By Engineers, Fine Art
The Graduate Record Examina­
tion is a series of tests designed to 
show the nature and extent of a 
student’s actual equipment in knowl­
edge in comparison with groups 
having similar training. This exam 
required two half-day sessions of 
four hours per session. On Febru­
ary 6th and 13th, all juniors in the 
College of Engineering took the 
exams. On March 30th and April 
3rd, all sophomores and seniors in 
the College of Fine Arts took the 
exams. The object of this article is 
to compile the opinions of both the 
Engineer and the Fine Arts student. 
Both believed that the other would 
do well on certain parts of this text, 
and both will be very surprised to 
learn the opinion of the other in 
regard to their respective major 
subjects.
Carol Myers of the Music Depart­
ment says, “We were disgusted in 
that on the advanced test in Fine 
Arts there was absolutely nothing 
concerning music. Is music not con­
sidered one of the Fine Arts?” 
Mildred Schmertz of the Archi­
tecture Department says, “What are 
we; architects or a lot of Museum 
Curators?”
Doris Fast of the Drama Depart­
ment says, “Well, I guess I can see 
their purpose, but I was personally 
awfully embarrassed by the tests. 
It was a terrific shock to suddenly 
discover how very little I knew 
about much of anything. They cer­
tainly make for a good old-fashion- 
ed inferiority complex.”
Erwin Kalla of the Sculpture De­
partment says, “If that is what the 
well-informed person should know 
I shall never be well informed.” 
Nick Reed of the Civil Engineer­
ing Department says, “Having stud­
ied only one year of College Eng­
lish, and that course not including 
advanced methods of swearing, I 
find that I am unable to express 
myself adequately on the subject of 
the Graduate Record Examination.” 
Merle Wolff of the Mechanical 
Engineering Department says, “I 
think that the test fulfilled its pur­
pose in that it determined the actual 
knowledge a person had on a wide 
variety of subjects. It wasn’t a test 
of how much a person crammed but 
of practical knowledge gained from 
interest and thought on a particular 
subject.”
Professor Readio, Head of the 
Painting and Design Department, 
says, “The type of knowledge tested 
seemed to have little relation to the 
aims or needs of those who expect 
to become professional performers 
in the Arts.”
Professor Hitchens, Head of the 
Architecture Department says, “The 
examination wasn’t appropriate to a 
progressive, professional school.” 
Professor Ellis, Head of the Sculp­
ture Department says, “Here, where 
objectives and curricula so stress 
the working, living, and functional 
attributes of the Fine Arts of Paint­
ing, Architecture, Music, Drama and 
Sculpture the recent subjection of 
sophomores, and seniors from all de­
partments to the digging for data 
as to chronological sequence, cen­
tury, school, pupil and master cata­
loging, etc., suggest an archaeologi­
cal appendage wagging the dog of 
intensive doing.”

Carnegie Book Drive 
Held Here This Week
As another semester comes to an 
end, we are all eager enough to put 
away books for a few days, a few 
weeks, or a few months—depending 
upon a person’s good fortune. But 
there are 6,000,000 men scattered 
throughout the world who would be 
just as eager to get their hands on 
a book, even one that they had read 
before. They would be thankful to 
pour over almost any old textbook 
that we are ready to discard. These 
6,000,000 ambitious readers are the 
prisoners of war interned in various 
countries throughout the world. The 
interests and activities available to 
them are so limited as to repre­
sent a serious threat to mental 
health. We can help to alleviate 
their dangerous boredom by con­
tributing all the books we no longer 
want and some that we do to the 
book drive which Tech is having 
the week of April 17-22.
There will be receptacles in the 
main office of each of the three col­
leges to receive all books that are 
contributed. Each contributor can 
help the project along by making 
sure that his books are free of pen­
cil and ink markings, stamps, labels, 
and bookplates. All types of books 
will pass censorship regulation ex­
cept the following:
1. Magazines and newspapers.
2. Any book having military sig­
nificance. Advanced technical books:

Pleased With Co-Eds
From the wearers of bell-bottom 
trousers your blushing reporter col­
lected the following quotations, 
§ome of which are worthy of being 
inscribed in this annal of wit and 
jvisdom.
First mixing a Voodoo concoction 
pf Tabu, Chanel No. 5 and the ever- 
faithful “My Sin,” we partook of 
fhis powerful potion and went forth 
on the campus to stalk our unsus­
pecting prey. (You can buy our 
•perfume specialty when the moon is 
Jin the seventh house of Pices.)
At first there was an expression 
pf mixed incredulity, amazement, 
and horror on their faces, but after 
,one whiff of our brew, we had them 
,in our power. The questions we 
;asked, simply phrased in King’s 
English, “What do you think of 
Tech, and of Tech girls?” were met 
with the expression that only a 
gob can have. (Must have been the 
.spell of the perfume—or do they all 
.roll their eyes in that peculiar 
fashion?)
As we approached our first “salt,” 
he quickly, and furtively, hid his 
^bottle of unspiked Pepsi, and peer­
ed intently through the clouds of 
.¡the smoke-filled Canteen to see 
.what manner of creature was this 
who dared intrude upon his poker 
£ame. Timidly, we voiced our ques­
tions, and after a 15-minute naval 
conference with his fellow card- 
sharks, he emerged, triumphant 
with these awe-inspiring words:
“We came, we saw . . .we’re 
Reaving!”
Again summing up our courage 
and perfume, we cruised about in 
^search of another victim. Stumbling 
,over the bodies of two expiring jit­
terbugs, we gazed into the big blue 
,eyes of a gorgeous 6’2” sailor, and 
gulping slightly, we gasped our in­
quiries in a trembling voice. Into 
jthe sultry air of the Canteen drip­
ped the molasses-filled voice of a 
southern Sinatra, as he chivalrously 
replied:
“They look unhappy—but I’m do- 
¿ng my best.”
j Hopefully assuming a sad air, we 
/quietly slipped him our telephone 
number, and staggered out into the 
fresh air.
Enroute to the Grill, our next 
^hunting-ground, we spied two in­
teresting uniforms, amply filled 
,with muscles, and planting our- 
-selves firmly in their way, waited 
expectantly. The whistle came . . . 
,The response to our questions was, 
surprisingly enough, favorable: 
“We think Tech is perfect—couldn’t 
be any better. We’ve been to a lot 
of places, and this is the best. And 
af it can be arranged, we’ll take 
juration here.”
t With elated spirits, we made our 
,way to Navyland (alias Carnegie 
Grill). Surveying the landscape, fill­
ed with that delightful color blue, 
,we picked a table surrounded by 
,that well-known specie of wolf, 
,Sailorae. Their first comment was, 
“Can we tell the truth?” to which 
,we replied, “Yes, anything that is 
printable.” Although they had some 
¡difficulty wording a reply in a lan­
guage so alien to their habitual 
tongue, we finally were able to get 
.these answers:
I “I think the Tech girls are the 
most beautiful in the world, but

Miss Bloom asked A. C. A. C. to spon­
sor a book drive on campus during the 
week of April 17. The books collected 
are to go to American prisoners of war in 
many countries of the world. Five col­
leges of the city are combining efforts to 
collect books, but because of the acceler­
ated program Tech will conduct her drive 
in advance of the other schools.
Adjournment.

Farewell To Butch
Tech bids a fond farewell to 
Butch, the friendly little “calling 
card” of “Red,” one of the sailors 
now stationed at CIT. Butch is a 
tiny, but extremely active, reddish- 
brown squirrel, purchased in Ala­
bama for $8.00. Red has. had count­
less offers for his pet, but he says, 
“I wouldn’t sell him for anything.”
Butch has made friends with all 
the girls at Tech—definitely a wolf 
at heart. His owner, a red-headed 
sailor from Georgia, (with a terri­
fic accent) takes him everywhere— 
even on dates. Butch evidently 
likes movies, and decidedly ap­
proves of dance-halls. He also 
seems very much at home at Tech; 
his favorite haunt is the Canteen, 
roaming over the tops of the card 
tables during bridge games, or 
perching on top of the juke box dur­
ing “hot” numbers.
they’re too unfriendly.”
; “Yes,” chimed another, “The Pitt 
.girls are giving them a lot of com­
petition.”
“Of course,” commented a third 
¿sailor (just our type, too) “It’s all 
jn the technique ...”
, Amid the crashing of chairs and 
Coca-Cola bottles, the screams of 
frlood-thirsty coeds, and the groans 
¦of the management, we grabbed the 
two nearest sailors, and made our 
¡yvay out, into the night.

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Invasion Coast Blitz 
Slated By Experts 
Soon, Not Too Soon
From every corner and from 
every source come hints, sugges­
tions, and even outright statements 
that the hour of invasion is near. 
What, heretofore, had been the most 
closely guarded secret of the war 
has now come into the open, par­
tially at least, with declarations by 
the highest - ranking authorities 
there are. Minor events take place 
which hint of the coming parade. 
The wasted strip along the English 
Channel is closed to civil popula­
tion. The German lay open their 
plans to flood the low countries.
Until not so very long ago, 
it had been assumed by all that the 
invasion of Europe would come, and 
would come directly across the 
Channel. Within the past six 
months, however, there had arisen 
in the minds of many observers an 
entirely different possibility. Their 
new line of reasoning was predicat­
ed on the smashing effectiveness of 
the Russian Army: that Europe
need not be invaded from the West; 
that the democracies could continue 
the bombing of Germany from the 
air and simply by menacing Festung 
Europa from England, could tie up 
innumerable supplies of men and 
material. If an invasion attempt 
were made, and thrust back, Ger­
many would need not fear a second 
front for months, even years, to 
come, and could, therefore, stand 
against the Red Army. Therefore, 
came the conclusion, an actual land 
invasion of Europe was not neces­
sary and the Western Allies would 
eliminate the potentially tremend­
ous casualities incumbent in any 
such operation.
But now speaks forth General 
Omar Bradley, held by many as 
one of the ablest field commanders 
on the allied side. General Bradley 
poohpoohs the talk of immense cas­
ualities and declares that an Anglo- 
American sweep across the Chan­
nel would be so irresistible as to ob- 
liviate the possibility of hundreds of 
thousands of casualities. This state­
ment is one in a series set down by 
Allied leaders of late, and in effect 
says outright that the European in­
vasion will come, and will come 
soon.
Without doubt, the actual inva­
sion and breaking through the pre­
pared defensive positions of the en­
emy will take a heavy toll. How 
heavy cannot even be guessed—too 
many factors are concerned. But 
whether these casualities sustained 
in the opening smash will be the 
mass or not will depend upon the 
combat effectiveness of the Ameri­
can and British Armies. If, after 
breaking through, the Allied Armies 
are held to a snail’s-pace advance 
casualities will soar. But if the mo­
mentum—both physical' and psy­
chological — gained by the first 
crushing drive can keep the Ger­
mans off-balance, and keep them 
reeling back and back in disorgan­
ized retreat, caualities may well be 
lighter than those hoped for by the 
most rose-colored advocates of rose- 
colored glasses.
The American Army, after two 
and a half years of war, is still un­
tested. There have been some first- 
class skirmishes, but its full might 
has never been hurled at the enemy. 
Upon the tacticians, then, of the 
British and American Armies rests

Drama Department 
Honored By Deslion
New laurels have been sent to 
the Drama Department, this time in 
the shape of a thankful commenda­
tion from the staff of the Deshon 
General Hospital for valiant ser­
vices rendered on the home front.
The patients of the Deshon Hos­
pital, most of whom are soldiers 
who were injured in action, have 
been entertained by the Drama De­
partment a number of times during 
this semester. On their first visit, 
February 6, a group of drama stu­
dents presented a one-act play, 
“Take Two, They’re Small,” which 
was written and directed by the 
students. The play was followed 
up with skits and songs in true 
vaudeville style.
“Siren of the Niles,” written by 
Kenny Welsh and directed by Prissy 
Dodge of the Drama Department 
was given on February 29. The cast 
included Tech students and mem­
bers of the Pittsburgh Playhouse. 
As a specialty on this visit, the girls 
went from room to rom to entertain 
bedridden patients.
An orchid to the Drama Depart­
ment for their fine morale-building 
work.
the responsibility of holding cas­
ualities to a minimum. This can 
probably best be done by out-Ger- 
manizing the Germans; by astonish­
ing them and surprising them per­
petually until they are driven into 
a mental state of fearing for fear’s 
sake. Until, in other words, their 
morale is smashed by the realization 
that they cannot win.
Commencement . . .
continued from page 1 
the audience. The chorus of the 
Department of Music will sing Mo­
zart’s “Ave Verum,” and the Wom­
en’s Chorus of the Music Depart­
ment will give the “Hymn of the 
Virgin” by Verdi. Both choral 
groups will be under the direction 
of Professor Frederick Dorian. Rev­
erend William R. Farmer will deliv­
er an address to the candidates for 
degrees entitled “While We’re In 
Our Prime.” Mr. Charles A. H. 
Pearson, M. A. ’32. will preside over 
the Little Theater organ for the eve­
ning.
The commencement exercises will 
be held on Sunday afternoon, April
30, at three o’clock. The March from 
the First Symphony by Widor will 
open the ceremony. Dr. Robert E. 
Doherty will preside. No one has 
yet been selected to give the invo­
cation at the ceremony, but Edward
O. Tabor, attorney at law, has con­
sented to give an address entitled 
“Search for Maturity.” During the 
services Rayel’s “Pavane,” Sibelieus’ 
“Finlandia,” and organ recessional, 
“The Grand Chour Dialogue” by 
Gigout will be played. Of course, 
the Alma Mater and the National 
Anthem will feature on the pro­
gram. The orchestra of the Depart­
ment of Music under the baton of 
Dr. J. Vick O’Brien will furnish the 
music for the affair.
A recent unofficial count of the 
graduating seniors reveals that 136 
bachelor degrees will be given at 
the commencement exercises. Forty 
Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees will 
be given to the seniors from the 
Fine Arts College. Forty-six MMCC 
girls will get Bachelor of Science 
degrees. The Carnegie Library 
School will give seventeen Bachelor 
of Science and Library Science 
sheep-skins. The Engineering Col­
lege will give thirty-two degrees, 
the majority of which will be to 
nightschool students. Nine boys who 
are now wearing Navy Blue will get 
their engineering sheepskins from 
Carnegie at the same time. Four­
teen advanced degrees will also be 
given.

tor of the First Church, St. Paul, 
Minnesota, before becoming the 
minister at the Edgewood Church, 
Pittsburgh. Since 1939 he has been 
the chaplain at the University of 
Pittsburgh. Dr. Farmer’s topic, 
“While We’re in Our Prime,” will 
prove to be very enlightening.
Mr. Tabor was born on August 
12, 1885, in Oxford Junction, Iowa. 
In New Orleans he worked on the 
levees and attended Tulane Univer­
sity, where he was a Phi Beta Kap­
pa. He received his B. A. degree 
and taught there for three years. At 
the University of Wisconsin he did 
graduate work, receiving an ap­
pointment as scholar in American 
History after he received his Mas­
ters degree there in 1909. He taught 
English in Portland, Oregon. While 
he was out West he worked as a 
lumber-jack in the Oregon forests 
and as a miner in the lead and silver 
mines in Idaho. He attended the 
Harvard Law School from 1913-1916 
during which time he also was an 
instructor in Public Speaking at 
Harvard College. He has been in 
Pittsburgh since the fall of 1916. He 
has practiced law for 25 years. For

gal Aid Bureau; he also had a gen­
eral practice (four years in Union- 
town). At present, along with his 
regular practice, he is Chief Coun­
cilor for the West Penn Power Co. 
and Associated Interests. Mr. Tabor 
is one of the most versatile men, for 
his interests aren’t limited to his 
law profession. During the last war 
he was in charge of all foreign lan­
guage speakers; a job which meant 
checking their activities so that they 
stayed within the rules and regula­
tions. In 1918-19 he was active in 
the American Program in Western 
Pennsylvania under the Council of 
National Defense. The purpose of 
the program was to help the new 
Americans to become acquainted 
with America and America to be­
come acquainted with them. Under 
this program schools were built in 
factories and in industry and night 
schools were developed for the for­
eign born. In 1927 Tabor was given 
the Revolutionary Medal by Presi­
dent Masaryk for his help during 
the war in destroying the Austro- 
Hungarian Empire and in establish­
ing the Czech Republic. In 1929 
when he traveled throughout Eu­
rope, particularly in the nations 
where there was freedom and liber­
ty of spirit, he was decorated with 
the Order of the White Lion by 
President Benes. He has also 
been a member of the Extension 
Department of the University of 
Pittsburgh as a speaker on such sub­
jects as Americanization and Cen­
tral European History with empha­
sis on the Slavic Countries. He is 
interested in Civic matters espe­
cially “clean and decent politics’* 
and progressive movements in the 
community. He is the chairman of 
the Inter-Racial Community con­
cerning the problem of Negroes and 
whites. He is active in the Free 
World Association and the All Out 
Aid for Britain. He is chairman of 
Pittsburgh Citizens’ Council for 
United Nations whose job is two­
fold: to help secure Victory for the 
Allies, and to set up after the war 
a world organization to secure peace 
and prevent future wars. His ac­
tivities in civic and world .affairs 
will give him an inexhaustible back­
ground for his address “Search for 
Maturity.”

Hunted From The
Bowel of EH to MM
Trying to get hold of the seniors 
who are graduating on April 30 is 
quite a job. But, since the manag­
ing editor requests it, it must be 
done.
We started our hunt quite sanely 
and intelligently by applying at the 
registrar’s office for a list of the 
graduating seniors; from there we 
were sent to the News Bureau, and 
then began our merry chase.
We went in search of the heads 
of each department for our informa­
tion, but first we stopped at the 
canteen for a little refreshment, and 
there we met our first victim.
Miss Louisa Saul, Household Ec. 
major, headed the list. Our first 
question was, “What do you intend 
to do after leaving school?”
“I’m going to California.”
“Why?”
“Just for the hell of it, and then I 
intend to get a job in a hospital.” 
“What are your favorite indoor 
and outdoor sports?”
“Sleeping and playing tennis.” 
Then we asked the question that 
floored practically everyone 
“Are you crusading in favor of, 
or against, anything?”
“Well, I guess if I’m crusading 
against anything it’s lecture classes. 
I don’t think they serve any good 
purpose.”
At this point we stopped asking 
questions and let everyone tell us 
his opinions on stuff, and anything 
else he had to say.
“I’m taking House Ec. because I 
want to write, and in order to write, 
well, you must have some particular 
subject; House Ec. gives me a good 
background for writing on family 
life.”
While we were still in the canteen
our editor pointed out Miss Natalie
Kubin, Dramat; we slinked along 
the walls until we reached Miss Ru­
bin, who was sitting with Miss 
Jacqueline Vlaskamp, and fired our 
questions at her. The two girls col­
laborated on these answers. 
“Broadway.”
“Because I want to be an actress, 
naturally.”
“Horseback Riding.”
On our Crusade question Miss 
Rubin merely shrugged and refused 
to commit herself.
Having exhausted the canteen’s 
possibilities, we left to go depart­
ment head-hunting. As we left the 
Canteen our photographer recogniz­
ed two music majors, and the stalk 
was on. We cornered Miss Gerry 
Edelson and Miss Ruth Moore in 
front of Fine Arts, and went through
our list of questions again. Miss 
Edelson answered first.
“Eat, sleep, and make merry until 
the first of May; after that I would 
like to teach.”
We must have forgotten to ask 
Miss Edelson her favorite sports, for 
our next answer deals with her 
crusade:
“The only thing I’m crusading 
against right now is this interview. 
I don’t like it.”
We don’t blame Miss Edelson at 
all, but still we went on. She said 
her opinions were nondescript, re­
fused to give us her phone number, 
and turned us over to Miss Moore. 
“Work at teaching.”
“Swimming indoors and out.” 
“No violent crusade.”
As we left, Miss Edelson threw 
this statement after us:
, “Good questions deserve good an­
swers—if you only had good ques­
tions.”
On looking over our notes, we 
discovered that we had left out one 
vital statistic: Miss Moore is en­
gaged to a gentleman in the Signal 
Corps. That was the final straw that 
broke our attempts to get phone 
numbers for our personal file.
We finally entered the Arts build­
ing, and reached one of those “in the 
know” in the Drama department. 
There we received a list of all the 
senior dramats, and also met Miss 
Ruth Storm, a production major. 
We have a vague suspicion that we 
Jiave lost our notes on this inter­
view, therefore, we will have to 
write only what we remember; the 
part that we forgot concerns indoor
and outdoor sports which nobody 
.cares about anyway. However, Miss 
Storm is not a bridge fiend; she is 
crusading for a Federal Theater, a 
.theater which is government-owned 
and will therefore allow the legiti­
mate stage to exist in smaller cities
and towns where there is not suffi­
cient profit for a private theater. 
Miss Storm had quite a bit to say 
about the letter which appeared in 
,the Tartan criticizing the drama de­
partment for not allowing the dra­
mats time off to go to Spring Car­
nival. She said that the dramats 
plid not expect any bed of roses 
when they came to Tech, and all of 
them were here because they love 
(the theater; none of the dramats 
jninded not going to Spring Carni- 
,val because they had to work, and 
if a poll were taken, it would show 
that the dramats themselves think 
their work is more important than 
a school dance, even if it is the big­
gest dance of the year.
We left Miss Storm and headed 
toward Engineering Hall. Down, 
down, ever downward we struggled 
(until the pressure began to beat on 
our eardrums like some voodoo 
priest beating out a chant. When 
,we thought we could go no further, 
we had reached our destination, 
jiamely Irwin Brier, Chemical En­
gineer, one half of the graduating 
class from the College of Engineer-
pveryone out for some sort of col­
lege athletics. College should give 
the student not only mental train­
ing, but physical and social as well.”
Opinion“The possibilities for ob­
taining a true world peace depends 
on the young, scientifically-trained 
¿nen who have come from schools 
teaching democratic principles, be­
cause science in the wrong hands 
leads to war.”
We discovered that Mr. Brier 
practices what he preaches. During 
the last football season he played 
in every game, and during the Pitt 
game he threw the pass that gave 
us the only touchdown we got dur­
ing the game.
An unusual sidelight on that af­
fair was that Mr. Brier had bet that 
,Tech would not be beaten by more 
.than forty-five points. As the final 
¿score was 45-6, it can be seen that 
J3rier WOn his own bet on his pass.
We climbed laboriously back to 
.ground level and staggered across 
Margaret Morrison Street where we 
ran into Mr. John Handloser, Physi­
cist, the other half of the Engineer­
ing School’s graduates.
, “I am going to stay in school for 
either graduate work or research.” 
“Basketball and Skiing.”
“I believe that the National Ros­
ter should be reinstated. I can’t see 
.where a mere 10,000 students will 
make enough difference in the war 
keffort to warrant their scientific 
training being broken off. These 
scientifically trained men will be of 
.great assistance to the war effort 
kwhen their training has been com­
pleted.
“I would like to see those alcoves

asked The Questions.
“Boxing and football.”

Started to work.
( “Dancing and tennis.”
Crusade—“Nothing in particular, 
.except maybe higher wages and 
shorter working hours.”
Opinion—“A pre-war Tech again, 
not just a place to study but a school 
where you can get a well-rounded 
(education.”
. “I like studying here but I am 
anxious to get out in the business 
world.”
We were now on the last leg of 
our journey and we drew up, pant­
ing, at the stage door of the Little 
.Theatre. We sneaked in past the 
guards and luckily met Ruth Storm, 
a previous interviewee, who assisted 
¿is in getting more seniors for our 
evil ends. Ethel Gerson, drama:
“Dancing and swimming.”
“A Federal Theatre” (which has 
previously been explained). Miss 
Gerson was in a hurry to do some­
thing or other in connection with 
,the play, so we took our picture and 
left to find more victims.
Miss Jane Franklin, Dramat, was 
stuck with The Question next.
Opinion—“The Tartan should get 
an intelligent reviewer for the 
shows, seeing as they are part of 
the school. I do not think a dramat 
should review these plays, but some­
one who has some experience and 
knowledge of plays.”
We now ran in search of Richard 
Hare, the only graduating male dra­
mat. We found him in the scene 
design room and went to work. He 
has a job waiting for him in New 
York but will not disclose its nature.
“Fencing, horseback riding, and 
Sailing.”
“I am crusading in favor of Mod­
ern Art.”
“I don’t think that any money 
should be wasted in redoing Fine 
Arts as it is such an Architectural 
Mess.”
A general comment was, “Women 
:—some are nice!”
As we were talking to Mr. Hare 
,two more seniors walked in. Need 
I say more? Miss Jean Graham,

THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1944
one of the profsThe Vacuum Cleaner
The chronicle of the life of John 
Haven Neelley, B. S., M. A., Ph. D., 
and at present Professor of Mathe­
matics at Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, could fill many a vol­
ume; condensed into two or three 
columns it will sound like a com­
pound biography of half a dozen 
persons.
Dr. Neelley began his colorful life 
way down South in Tennessee. He 
is 100% a Southerner, and proud of 
it: one of his great-grandfathers
and both his grandfathers fought for 
the Confederacy in the Civil War. 
Consequently, after finishing high 
school, he continued his education 
at Vanderbilt University in Nash­
ville, Tennessee, where he became 
a member of Sigma Nu, undergrad­
uate social fraternity, and Gamma 
Alpha, graduate social fraternity. 
Subsequent to his graduation as a 
Bachelor of Science and his elec­
tion into Phi Beta Kappa, he receiv­
ed his Master of Arts degree with a 
major in Political Science and a 
minor in Philosophy.
During his stay at Vanderbilt, Dr. 
Neelley pitched for the varsity base­
ball team, and after the completion 
of his graduate work he accepted 
an offer from the Washington Sen­
ators and joined their Tampa, Flor­
ida, ball club as a professional play­
er. After two years of this, how­
ever, just when the Senators offered 
him a place on their major league 
team, Dr. Neelley decided to con­
tinue his academic career. Convinc­
ed, in spite of his background, that 
those damyankees did have some 
good points, he went to Yale Uni­
versity to work for a Ph. D. in math­
ematics. While he was pursuing his 
doctorate he was elected into Sigma 
Xi, and found enough time to play 
football and baseball for his uni­
versity.
The doctor’s degree culminated a 
college education most of us can 
only dream of: three degrees, admis­
sion into the two foremost national 
honoraries, membership of two so­
cial fraternities, and participation 
in varsity sports; all this and a won­
derful time, too.
After these memorable achieve­
ments Dr. Neelley began his teach­
ing career in several Tennesse high 
schools, in the dual capacity of 
mathematics instructor and base­
ball and basketball coach. He soon 
returned to Yale as an instructor of 
Math, and in 1928, refusing an as­
sistant professorship at New Hav­
en, he came to Carnegie Tech as 
Associate Professor of mathematics, 
becoming a full Professor in 1930.
Dr. Neelley’s literary achieve­
ments have been as manifold and 
successful as his educational under­
takings. In cooperation with Dr. 
Joshua Tracey, Associate Profes­
sor of math at Yale, he has publish­
ed two editions of “Differential and 
Integral Calculus,” which have been 
tremendously successful, and are at 
present used in universities in the 
United States, Mexico, Panama, and 
Canada. His two alternate editions 
of “Plane and Solid Analytical Ge-
. • . John H. Neelley
ometry” are bringing the rudiments 
of college mathematics to freshmen 
at Harvard, Princeton, M. I. T., and 
the Universities of Hawaii, Mon­
treal, and Puerto Rico. In addition, 
fifteen articles on cubic, quartic, and 
quintic plane curves in various 
American and foreign journals have 
established his fame as geometer, 
specializing in problems concerning 
compound singularities. During the 
past two years he has cooperated 
with various mathematicians in Can­
ada and this country in the writing 
of an Encyclopedia of Mathematics, 
to be published in the course of this 
year.
His eminence in mathematics has 
been recognized by his admission to 
the American Mathematical Society, 
and the Mathematical Association of 
America. He is listed in “Who’s 
Who in Pennsylvania,” “Who’s Who 
in Massachusetts,” “Who’s Who in 
the East,” “American Men of Sci­
ence,” “Who’s Who in America,” 
“Who’s Who in the Western Hemi­
sphere.”
Ph. D. and professorship in math­
ematics and a position as pitcher in 
a major league circuit would be 
enough to make most people’s life 
interesting, but these fields are just 
two of the many in Dr. Neeley’s his­
tory. As an undergraduate he spent 
his summer vacations traveling 
through every part of the United 
States, one summer as a migratory 
, worker running threshing machines 
and binders in the wheat fields of 
the Middle West, and at another 
time as a fruit picker in California. 
At one time he was a machinist in 
a railroad roundhouse in South Da­
kota. He can truthfully claim that 
he chose teaching as a profession 
only after looking over many other 
fields.
In addition to his teaching, Pro­
fessor Neelley has been busy with 
many other things during his stay 
at Carnegie Tech. For many years 
he coached our improvised base­
ball team, he was faculty advisor 
for Sigma Nu, and chairman of In­
terfraternity Council and fraternity 
Advisor’s Board.
Today Dr. Neelley lives at Mount 
Lebanon with his wife and two sons, 
both future scientists. His rare va­
cations are spent in his summer­
house in Massachussets, a twelve 
room mansion surrounded by two 
acres of vegetable and fruit gardens. 
His present hobby, early Ameri­
cana, filled both houses with one of 
the better collections of American 
antiques in the country to such an 
extent that his two boys say 
“Everything in our homes is antique 
except us.” Although interested in 
all phases of our development, Dr. 
Neelley has specialized in early 
American glass, and has given many 
lectures on this subject in various 
clubs and organizations.
This summer Dr. Neelley plans to 
spend a much needed vacation in 
his Massachussets home, dividing 
his time between his garden and the 
writing of a book for the C-25, C-26 
Geometry course. During his ab­
sence Carnegie Tech students will 
miss him, his uncannily precise 
chalk pitching, and his teaching; the 
school will be different without him.
Taking the guise of the “Inquir­
ing Reporter,” this week the Vacu­
um Cleaner has attempted to find 
the answers to some questions of 
world significance. The place of 
questioning was in and around the 
Canteen; the persons questions were 
the soldiers, sailors', and the stu­
dents of Tech; and the time was the 
past week.
The questions asked were as fol­
lows: How long can you hold a kiss? 
Do you have to come up for air? 
and, How do these kisses affect you?
Sy Corwin, Soph Chem. E.: In­
definitely. That’s a tough one, but 
it comes natural. Depends on what 
I do next!
Sue Crobaugh, Fr. Dramat.: I’m 
too interested to look at my watch.
I can swim underwater for two 
minutes, if that proves anything. 
Just bored; I like to go on to better 
things.
Lee Grassley, Storekeeper 3/C: 
As long as I want. About twice in 
any period of time. Unmentionable!
Sue Thompson, M.M. Fr.: As long 
as I feel like it. I don’t need air. 
Some are all right, some are better.
Ralph Eyman, Jr. Aero: Half an 
hour; after much longer it gets dis- 
jgusting. I can hold on straight 
through. They make me see how 
far I can get.
Bobbie Vallin, Fr. Dramat.: De­
pends who I’m kissing. I lose track 
of time when I kiss. If it’s a certain 
person, I get very weak in the knees.
By E. P. H.
Gerry Abelson, Jr. Chem. E.: All 
depends on the other person. De­
pends whether or not I have a cold 
in my nose. Just a kiss has no ef­
fect on me.
Peggy Graham, M.M.Jr.: Hours 
and hours. I’m longwinded. My re­
actions are undeterminable.
Jack Hochhauser, Jr. Dramat: 
Five minutes at the age of twelve, 
but my strength has weakened in 
my old age. If you have a technique, 
no air is necessary. Depends on who 
is on the other end of the kiss.
Caroline Cook, Fr. Drama: Are 
you kidding? I need practice first.
I always take an oxygen tent. Af­
fected ?—woo-woo!
Mai Festenstein, Sr. Chem. E.: 
Good heavens, I don’t know. Don’t 
come up for air until I’m done. 
Freud would have something to say 
about this.
Mickey Grossman, Fr. Dramat: I 
have no idea. Depends on how my 
nose is. I get a tingling up and down 
my spine.
Richard Hare, Sr. Dramat: As
long as I want to. I don’t have to 
have air. Very nice, but it can’t be 
published.
. Typical M.M.Fr.: As long as he 
can take it, I can. Oh, I breathe en 
route.. Just like melted butter.
Typical sailor (Smitty): Indefi­
nitely. I’m Navy trained, never 
come up for air. My red corpuscles 
chase my white corpuscles all 
around the deck.

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN9
SPORTS
New Course In Judo 
Offered Civilians By 
Phys. Ed. Department
, If you should ever meet an old 
friend in the street and he proffers 
his hand, think twice before shaking 
it. for the next instant may find you 
sailing through the air over his 
head, land on your face behind him. 
And even if you are six foot two, 
180 pounds, and fearless, and your 
friend is half-a-foot shorter, the 
same fate may befall you, because 
judo is a great equalizer of physical 
strength. *
And if you fail to heed this warn­
ing, and do find yourself in a pre­
dicament like that, the man to curse, 
as you rub your head and painfully 
pick yourself up from the ground, 
is Mr. Alexander of the physical 
education department. Because just 
a few weeks ago a course in judo 
was offered to the civilian students 
who were interested, and about 18 
turned out. And everyone likes it, 
except those unfortunates that stu­
dents practice their homework on.
Judo is similar to the old national 
sport of the Japanese, jiu jitsu. The 
main difference is that whatever 
sport there was in jiu jitsu is elimi­
nated, and judo is strictly for busi­
ness, the business of rendering an 
enemy helpless, and maiming or 
killing him. It is a scientific busi­
ness, not requiring exceptional 
strength but rather depending for 
its lethal effect upon knowledge of 
anatomy, the strong and weak 
points and the peculiarities of the 
human body. Thus a small man, 
who knows where to hit and hold 
can have someone twice his size 
screaming with pain in a matter of 
seconds. Judo was devised during 
this war with the advent of the new 
military tactics that called for com­
mandos, rangers, infiltration, un­
derground revolts, paratroops, quick 
and quiet killing. The theory be­
hind it all is to know anatomy to 
the point where you can make an 
enemy use his own strength against 
himself.
The course is striving only to give 
the fundamentals of judo. To be­
come expert at it would take spe­
cial training, conditioning and years 
of practice. The Japanese study and 
practice for years at it.
One accident has happened al­
ready in the class. It seems that a 
person who doesn’t know judo well 
can be more dangerous than some­
one who does. The fellows were 
practicing a new throw. Big Ben 
Baklarz was tossing six-foot-two 
Howie Johe around but something 
went wrong and they both tumbled 
to the mats, Baklarz atop the “Fish.” 
Johe’s collar bone was broken in 
the fall.
Judo has been praised as some­
thing that is useful in peacetime as 
well as in war. “The noble art of 
self-defense,” long extolled as some­
thing every man should know, is 
not nearly as efficient in self-protec­
tion as is judo. With it, women could 
even protect themselves. Yes, the 
time may be coming when the frail 
little heroine of the classic old melo­
drama may toss her tormentor, the 
bullying landlord, out the window 
of his own house with a flick of her 
shapely arm.
Saylor, Smith-Alter 
Cop Ping-Pong Titles
Last Thursday the long-awaited 
all-school ping-pong tournament 
was finally played off. During the 
week posters on the various bulletin 
boards around campus were signed 
by 38 entrants and nine teams of 
doubles.
Nearly every match was extremely 
close, but the field finally narrowed 
down to Dave Saylor and Connie 
Corey in the singles. Both were 
stripped to the waist because every 
point looked as big as a mountain 
and both were playing the best 
ping-pong they knew how. Corey 
took the first of the games by a close 
score and then went on to win the 
second more easily. However, Say­
lor was not yet out because the fin­
als consisted of the best three out 
of five games, and as it turned out, 
Corey never did get to win that 
third and match-clinching game. 
Two extremely close games follow­
ed, both of which Saylor won and 
so stayed alive, forcing the match to 
run to its very limit. Both men 
were playing way over their heads, 
making beautiful drives, and re­
turning almost impossible shots. 
The lead see-sawed back and forth, 
and only rarely was it more than a 
point. It was 19-18 in Corey’s favor 
when finally Saylor came through 
to win his third straight and thus 
clinch the match and the tourna­
ment.
The doubles competition, in which 
only nine teams were entered, was 
won by Smith and Alter who took 
three straight from Corwin and 
Segal to clinch the championship in 
this field.
Prizes in the form of keys will be 
awarded to the winners of each 
section.
THE GRANDSTAND
C. S. EDMAN
PRINTER
6470 Monitor St. HA. 0193
“Hey ,what’s going on here?”
*Those were the first words that 
Max Hannum could utter as he sud­
denly found himself amongst the 
same bunch of fellows who had 
worked under him during the bas­
ketball season. This memorable oc­
casion of two weeks ago was a sur­
prise party which was thrown for 
him by the ever-faithful Mr. Walter 
Burns and an appreciative basket­
ball squad.
The party was a real surprise for 
Max who thought that he was going 
to speak before some “association 
of manufacturers of Western Penn­
sylvania” and to his great relief 
found himself pushed through the 
door by his friend, Mr. Burns, and 
confronted only by friendly familiar 
faces.
It didn’t take Max very long to 
recover from his immediate shock, 
however, and before long he was 
telling the gathering more of those 
interesting and varied experiences 
in his association with basketball.
At first everyone was too interest­
ed in eating to say very much, but 
afterwards Mr. Burns and the team 
put on an interesting program of 
entertainment. They even serenad­
ed Max with a little ditty about that 
rapidly disappearing shock of hair 
on his head. But not everything 
was on the light side. The fellows 
wanted to show their appreciation 
for the fine job of coaching them 
that Max did. For certainly it took 
a lot of ability and perseverence to 
try to train a group of basketball 
hopefuls who were fired with plenty 
of enthusiasm but were lacking in 
almost every other requirement for 
a winning team. And when it came 
for the coach’s turn to speak, he 
said that we don’t have to have a 
winning team to have a good team. 
Rather than success being measured 
in games won and lost, it is measur­
ed in team spirit and team coopera­
tion.
Following the dinner there were
By Sy Corwin
also speeches by President Doherty, 
Dr. Jones, Dean Murphy, Mr. Over­
end, and Mr. Patton, all of whom 
praised Coach Hannum fdr his fine 
job.
Now everyone wanted to hear 
some stories from Max, so a bunch 
of telegrams wishing Max good luck 
from some of his former players 
were whipped out. That really 
started the ball rolling, and with 
his memory refreshed Max com­
menced to tell his earnest listeners 
an ever increasing series of amus­
ing anecdotes. There was one where 
a player threw the ball so hard and 
wild that it went sailing high over 
the backboard and all that could be 
heard on the Temple court was 
Max’s voice shouting “Close the 
window, there goes the ball!”
The evening was not yet over— 
not until Coach Hannum was pre­
sented with a trophy, showing the 
appreciation of Mr. Burns and the 
basketball squad and then Mr. 
Burns showed some more of his 
generosity by passing out to the 
members of the squad tiny silver 
basketballs. The team, though, not 
to be outdone, then gave the esti­
mable Mr. Burns a watch chain.

10THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3flxe <3Fawe$ie plaid
Things to Think About
(This is the last in a series of articles discussing the decline of registration in 
the evening school).
With this issue of the Tartan the 
writer of this column of the Plaid 
page terminates the series of time­
ly remarks and suggestions concern­
ing registration and what Carnegie 
Tech has to offer the evening stu­
dents in the way of educational aid.
It has been pointed out that this 
term saw the smallest registration 
since Carnegie Tech attained its pin­
nacle; how the registration can ma­
terially effect courses and sched­
ules; how the students can be o 
great assistance in remedying the 
registration drop; how these stu­
dents could become salesmen for the 
institute, and how former and pres­
ent students could influence the 
courses of studies and the education­
al program.
Carnegie Tech is a live institution, 
young as educational institutions 
are rated, and as a consequence has 
many things in its favor which 
should help in meeting the transi­
tion period which is surely coming.
There is a growing tendency on 
the part of the public to expect 
changes in the type and manneJ ?f 
educational aid and the method m 
which it is dispensed. A commen^ 
apropos to this appeared in one of 
our local papers recently which, 
while somewhat ambitious, does in­
dicate something. It is interesting 
to read some of the comments writ­
ten about education and the 
strength of numbers represented by 
the educational groups. It is noted 
that “. . • such a group with exten 
sion into every city, hamlet and 
rural section of the country is the 
school-going group. This section of 
our population should have the 
means of acquiring state and 
al legislation for complete free 
schooling in trades, professions, fine 
arts, arts and technical callings. The 
school days should be shortened -o 
two or three hours. Parallel courses 
running concurrently after the sixth
grade in school should lead to 
graduation in a trade profession 
artistic or technical calling at the 
age of 15 or 16.”
“With our present fast tempo of 
living general education can be 
considerably eliminated and spec­
ialized training substituted.
“A union of all grade, high school, 
academy, college and university 
students is imperative to bring 
about these modern innovations and 
to establish a complete free anglic­
ized public university education 
throughout the state and nation. 
University education must be free.
That is a big order and it shows 
that some thought is being given to 
the content and type of education 
which may be expected hence.
With the social and economic 
changes which are rapidly coming 
to the foreground a new order is 
being ushered in and one cannot be 
content with the proverbial “horse 
and buggy” days. It becomes im­
perative that those of us working in 
specialized fields broaden our views.
A move in this direction would be 
to make available to the evening 
students of Carnegie Tech those 
courses dealing with social relations
Highlights of the The Carnegie Plaid
STOO-DENTS! With the issue 
this week I find myself groping for 
words befitting this occasion which 
highlights our last issue. With fin­
als coming up in the course of the 
next few weeks, a note of serious­
ness echoed around the campus as 
the students fluttered about busily 
making final arrangements to con­
clude this, our night school year. 
Yes, even the practice rooms where 
a few steps carried one from Chopin 
to Barrelhouse seemed strangely 
quiet lately. But, in critical times 
such as these, all farewells are earn­
estly and tirelessly strived to be 
made cheerful, so there’s nothing 
that a dash of humor won’t do to 
spice up the situation. So let’s start 
out with George Biss. Evidently, 
quite evidently, he believes in the 
“Good Neighbor Policy.” His con­
stant need for carbon paper com­
pels him to beg, borrow, or steal 
it in Physics class. (Now I wonder 
who could have told on him?)
The famous Harmony I class 
you’ve heard so much about shares 
the spotlight again this week as 
they happily informed your report­
er that they all intend to register 
again in the Fall. Yessirreee! 
They’re REAL Techites.
The Maggie Murphs in Miss Hays’ 
Secretarial class also seemed to reg­
ister regret when confronted with 
the thought of the school term com­
ing to a rapid close.
With the permission of the Plaid 
readers, I would like to take this op­
portunity to convey to you in my 
own concise way the feeling of lone­
liness and regret which seems to 
tingle inside of me as I write my 
last column this term. As I sit here, 
I ponder over what I shall do on the 
Friday nights to come, as these were 
the nights I so happily worked on 
the gossip column that grew to be 
a part of me. The staff I have work­
ed with has been a friendly and ef­
ficient one, and, tell me, who could 
ask for a better Editor?
So, here’s to the Plaid, the staff, 
Council, and Faculty as I look for­
ward to working with them once 
again this Fall. Yes, these are but 
memories now — but aren’t they 
pleasant ones?
and the humanistic side of life. 
When an engineer or a specialist 
can see what the results of his pet 
dream, or plan, or invention can 
mean to the public, translated into 
human relations, then the individ­
ual engineer, specialist or scientist 
sees life in a newer aspect.
The past year has been a very ex­
acting one for the Evening Student 
Council. Faced with many problems 
which had not been experienced be­
fore, the members sitting on the 
council gave a very good account of 
themselves.
During the pervious year, there
Engineer’s Affair
The Twenty-ninth Annual Ban­
quet of the Evening College of En­
gineering can be written into the 
records as a huge success, despite 
the low enrollment and other de­
trimental factors. Friends of the 
engineering students turned out in 
large numbers and were more than 
pleased with the evening’s refresh­
ments and entertainment.
The predominating feature of the 
evening was the talk given by Dr. 
A. A. Bates. His discussion con­
cerned interesting facts of South 
America and South Americans. 
Some of the facts given by Dr. 
Bates were astonishing, conveying 
an entirely different picture than 
that given by the press.
Another interesting speaker with 
a timely talk was Lt. Mellott, who 
gave some very good advice and 
also some of the requirements nec­
essary to become a Navy officer.
The dinner itself was perfect — 
roast chicken and all the trimmings. 
A lovely accompianist played the 
favorite songs of the individual ta­
bles and before the dinner was half 
through, the entire group was sing­
ing (not only good, but loud).
After the speakers, the fun real­
ly began with a grand rush for the 
beer barrel. The service at the bar 
was excellent. It’s surprising what 
fine bar tenders engineers can make. 
With their thirst quenched, the 
group eagerly assembled for the 
floor show. It doesn’t seem possible 
that the gleam that came into the 
fellows eyes, when the floor show 
got under way, was due to the beer 
they had just drunk, or was the 
bright spot light resposible? Peg 
Lanahan furnished the great floor 
show. Some fellows were heard to 
comment on the fine male dancer 
who did the wonderful dance of the 
table cloths, or was that the dance 
of the cheese cloths.
The final act of the evening was 
the distributing of door prizes fur­
nished by leading manufacturing 
companies. __________________
were indications that the following 
year would not be an easy one for 
the council and this is exactly what 
happened.
First of all, when council conven­
ed in the fall of the present school 
year, changes had to be made in 
the personnel in order to obtain a 
working nucleus. Next the quar­
ters where the council had been 
meeting for years were appropriat­
ed for other purposes and the group 
had to look around for other space 
in which to hold its meetings. Coun­
cil equipment was scattered here 
and there and it was not until to­
wards the end of this school year 
that all was recovered and assem­
bled.
Because of the very low registra­
tion, the fees available for council 
purposes were very meager, so it 
became necessary to make adjust­
ments, temporarily discontinuing 
some functions and consolidating 
others. In this way, council kept its 
expenses down to a minimum.
In the face of numerous hadicaps, 
members of the council, not to be

With this, the last issue of the 
Plaid for the school year of 1943-44, 
I sincerely bid farewell to all the 
readers of the “back page of the 
TartanNeedless to say, this has 
been a trying year for the Plaid 
staff. With registration at the lowest 
ebb in Evening School history, it 
has really been a job keeping the 
page filled with interesting and 
timely articles of campus activities 
of which there were a limited num­
ber indeed.
At the start of the school term 
there was a surprisingly large turn­
out of workers for the paper, but as 
the weeks rolled by, the number 
dwindled until, finally, near the end 
of the second semester, only one was- 
on hand to type the whole Plaid 
section. As I write this article, be­
side me sits just one member of the 
staff diligently but quietly writing 
the gossip column. Later she will 
go to work and type the whole page 
—I hope! I shudder when I think of 
the consequences were there but 
one more issue of the Plaid after 
this one. I would probably have to 
spend the entire week-end pounding 
the typewriter in hunt-and-poke 
fashion in a brave effort to master 
the paper unaided. And while I real­
ize the staff has been, quite faith­
ful, the shortage of workers has 
forced an increasing pressure on 
them, so here’s hoping to a larger 
staff this coming fall.
But with all joking aside, being 
Editor of the Plaid is quite an ex­
perience—one that I wouldn’t pass 
up for love or money. It is a rare op­
portunity, and upon knocking, I’m 
glad I answered. And so, I leave you 
with a feeling of reluctance and re­
gret, but heading my list of memor­
ies will be my job of editorship on 
the school paper at Carnegie Tech.
WAIT! Something new has been 
added! Looks as if our gossip editor 
shan’t have to stay up half the night 
typing. Typists to the right of me, 
typists to the left of me, typists all 
around me. I knew they wouldn’t 
let me down tonight of all nights.
outdone by last year’s group, un­
dertook to put on another engineers 
banquet. Assisted by the evening 
students, the banquet was held 
April 1st and “Successful” mildly 
describes the function. Thus, the 
tradition still follows through un­
broken.
Reviewing the past year’s work is 
very encouraging. The evening stu­
dent body was served by a council 
working hard to render assistance 
and it has done an excellent job in 
face of many hardships. The coun­
cil is to be congratulated for a job 
.well done.
