Student government will vote on constitution changes, additions
SABRINA PORTER
Contributing Editor
Wednesday is a big day 
for Carnegie Mellon’s stu­
dent government. The Un­
dergraduate Student Senate 
and Graduate Student As­
sembly (GSA) will be voting 
on a number of changes to the 
student body constitution and 
its supporting documents that 
address a variety of current in­
efficiencies. These changes in­
clude the addition of an elect­
ed role, the student body vice 
president of organizations 
(SBVPO), to the executive 
branch, as well as the creation 
of an advisory committee that 
includes the Student Dormi­
tory Council (SDC) and the 
Activities Board (AB).
Ruth Poproski, a Ph.D. stu­
dent in philosophy, joined the 
President’s Cabinet as consti­
tutional advisor this year with 
the main intention of taking 
on this project.
“A major part of this project 
has been one of clarification 
and organization,” Poproski 
said. “Someone should be 
able to pick up the constitu­
tion and understand the role 
of student government.” 
Poproski worked with a 
committee of five students, in 
addition to Student Senate, 
GSA, SDC, AB, and the Office 
of Student Activities.
Senate is in clear favor of 
the addition of the SBVPO 
and an advisory committee 
with SDC and AB, as seen at 
last Thursday’s meeting.
The SBVPO will become 
a position that is part of the 
student body elections in the 
spring. The new officer will 
join the executive branch, 
whose other members are 
the student body president, 
student body vice president, 
student body vice president of 
finance, Student Senate chair, 
and GSA president.
“I think that there needs
to be better communication 
with student government in 
terms of financing,” said Emi­
ly Anderson, a junior decision 
science and business double 
major and vice president of 
the Carnegie Mellon Business 
Association.
Poproski said the new posi­
tion will begin to address such 
issues. “The job of the VPO, in 
a very general sense,-will be to 
make the situation better and 
to legitimize the needs of stu­
dent organizations,” she said.
Poproski mentioned that 
the addition of an advisory 
committee that includes SDC 
and AB will bridge another 
area lacking connection. “One 
of the problems that has been 
acknowledged from several 
perspectives is the lack of com­
munication and collaboration 
between student government 
and SDC,” Poproski said.

According to Carl Kur- 
lander, executive producer 
of Steeltown Entertainment 
Project and producer of Saved 
By The Bell, “[Pittsburgh’s] 
greatest export isn’t steel; it’s 
talent.” As a response to the 
lack of outlets available for 
local talent, Kurlander and 
fellow panelists Asher Garfin- 
kel, president of Readers Un­
limited; Bernie Goldmann, 
producer of300; Laura Hark- 
com, writer and producer 
of The Lost Room; and Min- 
nette Seate, senior producer 
of WQED Multimedia came 
together with Steeltown 
Entertainment’s Film Fac­
tory to host a contest called
“Scripted Readings: Does
the Story Work” that would 
help alleviate this problem. 
This project allowed aspiring 
screenwriters in Pittsburgh to 
pitch screenplays for poten­
tial movies to some of Holly­
wood’s best producers, with 
a chance of winning $25,000 
to turn their scripts into mov­

chosen to have their scripts 
performed in front of a live 
audience.
Twelve sophomores from 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of

The Biometrics Lab works to create an iris fingerprint — a way to visu­
ally prove that an iris is a correct match to an image.
JENNIFER THARP
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Bio­
metrics Lab, led by electrical 
and computer engineering 
research scientist Marios 
Savvides, is exploring ways 
to improve facial and iris rec­
ognition technology through 
support from agencies such 
as the Department of Defense 
(DoD), the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, Intelligence 
Advanced Research Projects 
Activity, and the Office of 
the Director of National In­
telligence. Savvides has also 
been selected to be part of a 
Center of Academic Excel­
lence called the Center for 
Academic Studies in Identity 
Sciences through the Office 
of the Director of National 
Intelligence. Face recognition 
requires several steps, all of 
which students at Savvides’ 
lab are developing for ap­
plications in the real world. 
Once completed, these sepa­
rate components will be com­
bined.
In the laboratory, students 
work at a multi-step process 
so that one day cameras will 
easily identify a face from any 
angle. The first step is getting 
the camera to track the face’s 
movements. A camera follows 
a student walking backward 
the entire distance of the lab, 
and the green circle that pre­
dicts the head’s movement 
provides successful results.
Next, the camera needs
to identify the person. Yet, 
what if the person now wears 
glasses or has cut his or her 
hair? Especially in a secu­
rity situation, a suspect will 
often try to disguise his or 
her features. “We are trying 
to add human intelligence 
to face matchers,” Savvides 
said. Once a picture is taken, 
the computer can quickly 
relay the face’s gender, any 
facial hair, and if the subject 
is wearing glasses, all within 
a certain degree of accuracy. 
The program will select 20 
faces that best match the 
picture taken. These pictures 
have a high enough “bare 
score” to qualify them as a 
match to the original picture. 
Hopefully, adding the hu­
man intelligence component 
will reduce the risk of a com­
puter identifying the wrong 
people. “The worst thing that 
could happen is that you do 
the top 20 [matches] and the 
bare score that would have 
matched is not even in the 
top-20 list,” said Savvides.
Next, the laboratory ex­
plores how to identity a per­
son if their face is at a differ­
ent angle. Current cameras 
are only able to capture a face 
from ± 15 degrees. With the 
lab’s work, this technology 
could soon match any angle.

Heo, an electrical and com­
puter engineering graduate

When an earthquake struck 
the island nation of Haiti near­
ly three weeks ago, the United 
States was quick to respond. 
Carnegie Mellon students 
were encouraged by faculty, 
student government, and the 
many service organizations 
on campus to send whatever 
help they could to the millions 
of affected Haitians. Carnegie 
Mellon’s Division of Student 
Affairs and student govern­
ment organized and headed 
various events to help the 
cause, while hundreds of stu­
dents went to great lengths to 
show their support for Haiti 
relief.
Student Body President 
Rotimi Abimbola was respon­
sible for organizing the groups 
together and encouraging 
collaboration across organi­
zations. Two days after the 
first quake struck, nearly 20 
campus groups met to discuss 
their options. “Everybody had 
[a] small idea of what they 
wanted to do,” said Abimbola. 
“Everyone wanted to do some­
thing.”
These small ideas grew at 
an unmatched pace. Over the 
past two weeks, hundreds of 
dollars were collected and sent 
to nonprofit organizations like 
Doctors Without Borders and 
the Brother’s Brothers Foun­
dation. Services were held 
in the form of prayer groups 
and candlelit vigils to honor 
those who lost their lives and 
their loved ones. Students 
also tried to address the se­
rious medical issues facing 
Haiti in the aftermath of the 
earthquake. Around campus, 
groups set up boxes that en­
couraged students to deposit 
hygienic items to send to the 
victims, including buckets, 
hairbrushes, toothpaste, and 
toothbrushes. Other divisions 
of Carnegie Mellon, including 
the Silicon Valley campus in 
California, pledged support.
“Haiti’s always been re­
ally unfortunate,” said first- 
year computer science major 
Sammy Jelin, who collected 
donations on behalf of Stu­
dent Life. “It’s good people are 
helping out.”
Besides funds, Carnegie 
Mellon has also been utilizing 
its technological expertise. 
The Language Technologies 
Institute has worked on an 
updated translation system 
using new translating tech­
nology to convert Creole, the 
language spoken by most of 
Haiti’s population, into other 
languages, including French, 
the language spoken by much 
of Haiti’s upper class. Once 
the translation data becomes 
available in a readable for­
mat, the Paris organization 
Translators Without Borders 
has promised to distribute it 
to relief workers in Haiti.
Bridging communication 
gaps is a crucial step in pro­
viding relief. Abimbola has 
seen firsthand the importance 
of translating in her experi­
ence with caring for orphans 
who moved from Haiti to 
Pittsburgh. She expressed her 
frustration at being unable to 
reassure these Haitian chil­
dren of their safety and well­
being, and that it “broke [her] 
heart.”
Carnegie Mellon has also 
considered the future of Haiti, 
and has taken several paths to 
contribute to the long-term 
recovery of the nation. Once 
the funds have been finalized, 
they will be distributed to 
their respective charity orga­
nizations as soon as possible. 
Carnegie Mellon has also 
not ruled out the possibility 
of taking on another project 
such as, Abimbola alluded, 
the reconstruction of a school 
and sending Carnegie Mellon 
students to Haiti as teachers. 
The School of Drama’s class 
of 2010 plans to dedicate their 
senior cabaret to Haiti and its 
reconstruction. An unnamed 
alumnus has pledged to match 
whatever amount of money 
Carnegie Mellon raises, dollar
for dollar, with a donation of 
their own.
The relief effort has not 
been without controversy. 
One of the organizations to 
which Carnegie Mellon has 
pledged funds, Haitian singer 
Wyclef Jean’s Y£le founda­
tion, has been under scrutiny 
for misdirecting funds. Such 
exploitation has left many 
feeling unwilling to donate 
without seeing the changes 
that their money will bring. 
Sharon Wang, a senior mate­
rials science major, expressed
her belief that these people 
were “discouraged by the size 
of the [Helping Haiti] project” 
and unsure of what they could 
do.
Despite the long road to 
recovery ahead and the obsta­
cles presently facing students, 
Abimbola believes that the 
campus community remains 
dedicated to joining together. 
“Despite our roles as organiza­
tion leaders and students on 
campus,” she said, “you can 
still do things to help.”

LTI translates Haitian Creole Kitchin wins research grant
The Language Technolo­
gies Institute (LTI) has re­
cently released its textual and 
spoken data on Haitian Cre­
ole, the most common lan­
guage spoken in Haiti. (Ha- 
tian Creole and French share 
official language status.) This 
data is useful, as language 
has proven to be a barrier in 
the attempts of doctors, nurs­
es, and various aid workers to 
help the Haitian population 
since the earthquake nearly 
three weeks ago.
The LTI — a branch of the 
School of Computer Science 
that also focuses on subjects 
such as speech processing 
and computer-assisted lan­
guage learning — has been 
using this data to develop a 
new version of an outdated 
translation system that was
first created in the 1990s for 
a project under the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects 
Agency. Researchers at Mi­
crosoft have also been using 
the data to create a web- 
based system for translating 
between English and Haitian 
Creole.
Furthermore, a nonprofit 
organization, Translators 
Without Borders, plans on 
giving out a medical triage 
dictionary as soon as these 
data are available in a read­
able format.
These parallel efforts are 
part of a wider relief effort 
around the world. The LTI 
has emphasized that there 
are many diverse and non- 
traditional ways in which one 
can help those suffering in 
Haiti.
John Kitchin, an assistant 
professor of chemical engi­
neering, was recently award­
ed a five-year $750,000 Early 
Career Award from the U.S. 
Department of Energy. The 
grant will be used to de­
velop new materials in elec­
trochemistry that will allow 
scientists to derive hydrogen 
and oxygen from water.
Kitchin’s contributions to 
his field are particularly note­
worthy when considering 
he only completed his Ph.D. 
in chemical engineering in 
2004. Kitchin hopes that his 
research will provide for a 
more efficient means of pro­
ducing hydrogen from water, 
which will hopefully lead to 
the development of energy 
systems that can store renew­
able energy in chemical form.
Kitchin’s research lays a foun­
dation for the production of a 
biomass that could possibly 
fuel everything from cars to 
factories. Moreover, Kitchin 
stated in a press release on 
the Carnegie Mellon website 
that the oxygen produced 
“may play a crucial role in 
helping to manage the C02 
emissions through advanced 
fossil energy power systems 
such as oxycombustion and 
gasification.”
This award is funded by 
the Early Career Research 
Program as part of the Amer­
ican Recovery and Reinvest­
ment Act. Kitchin is one of 69 
professors nationwide to re­
ceive funding under this act.

The Carnegie Science 
Center announced its 2010 
Carnegie Science Awards last 
, Thursday.
“Each year the Carnegie 
Science Awards shines the 
spotlight on extraordinary 
researchers, entrepreneurs, 
and educators working in sci­
ence and technology fields/’ 
said Henry Buhl, Jr., co-direc- 
tor of the Carnegie Science 
Center, in the organization’s 
, press release. “Our region 
generates amazing talent and 
cutting-edge technology and 
advances in science-related 
industries. The awards pro­
gram recognizes the best and 
the brightest.”
While two other profes-
acting majors, agreed that “it 
was a great opportunity,” be­
cause usually only juniors and 
seniors perform in Carnegie

Luis von Ahn won the award 
in Information Technology 
and biology professor Alison

able mention for the Emerg­
ing Female Scientist Award
— Carnegie Mellon students 
studying civil and chemical 
engineering may recognize 
Gregory V. Lowry’s name as 
an honorable mention for the 
Environmental Award.
“Gregory Lowry is devel­
oping nanotechnology that 
can be used to clean up pol­
lutants, such as chlorinated 
solvents and heavy metals in 
drinking water. This technol­
ogy promises to be less in­
trusive and energy-intensive 
than conventional cleanup
ing elements specific to Pitts­
burgh. Beth Steidle, a creative 
writing graduate student at 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
took a darker tone in her 
screenplay N’At, stating that 
“in Pittsburgh, the winter, like 
the metal, is cold and hard.” 
Steidle’s script was a favor­
ite, according to Heise. “[It 
was] funny, creative, and very
approaches,” said Courtney 
Horne, a public relations rep­
resentative for Lowry.
What makes Lowry stand 
out to students is that, in ad­
dition to his research, he is 
also teaching 12-351 (Envi­
ronmental Engineering) this 
semester. Typically, professors 
investing in groundbreaking 
research have little time to de­
vote to a class of undergradu­
ates. Yet Lowry holds approxi­
mately three hours of class 
each week and encourages 
his students to e-mail him.
“He can be very interested 
in what he teaches. His lec­
ture style is very engaging, 
and he wants to impart his 
knowledge [to] his students,”

nior civil and environmental 
engineering major.

After this event, contes­

into a movie. The finished

Senate debates
CONSTITUTION, from A1
brought to the table that 
SDC form an external 
branch of student gov­
ernment. However, the 
alternate approach of an 
advisory committee was 
considered as a better solu­
tion, and AB was added for 
communication.
Aaron Gross, a junior 
decision science and H&SS 
interdisciplinary double 
major and Student Senate 
chair, spoke of the possibil­
ity of bringing other organi­
zations into the committee.
“At one of our past meet­
ings, someone brought 
up Interfraternity Council 
and Panhellenic Council,” 
Gross said. The Panhellenic 
Council and Interfraternity 
Council are the governing 
bodies of the sororities and 
fraternities, respectively.
These issues are just 
some of the proposals on 
the table for Student Senate 
and GSA to discuss and vote 
on this Wednesday.

In a separate room is a 
full-length scanner, similar to 
those in airports. The catch is 
that this one can identify your 
iris from up to 13 meters. The 
lab is working to make the 
images clearer by aligning 
several images of the iris into 
one higher-resolution image. 
A real-world application of 
this, explained Vijayakumar 
Bhagavatula, a professor in 
the department of electrical 
and computer engineering, 
is already in use in Canadian 
airports. “They use it for crew 
and people that use the air­
port very regularly. Instead 
of having them go through 
the standard check lines, 
they enroll the iris images 
of these people beforehand 
with background screening.” 
Additionally, Sawides and 
his team are working to cre­
ate an iris fingerprint, a way 
to visually prove that an iris is 
a correct match.
In the U.S. National Insti­
tute of Standards and Tech­
nology’s Face Recognition 
Grand Challenge (FRGC) and 
Iris Challenge Evaluation,
the projects met with suc­
cess in 2005, when Sawides 
and Bhagavatula’s team won 
first place at FRGC. They de­
veloped “an algorithm [that] 
went from a 12 percent veri­
fication rate to 82.4 percent 
verification. Most companies 
were between 35 and 50 per­
cent,” said Sawides.
With this technology, in­
stead of a soldier measuring 
a villager’s iris by hand, a 
system could scan villagers’ 
irises from a distance, thanks 
to a $3-4 million project Sav- 
vides has with the DoD. Cam­
eras could identify suspects 
before they reached human 
guards. A personal computer 
could turn off if its user left. 
Yet, with the advent of new 
technology also come privacy 
concerns for the subjects.
“My current research fo­
cuses on how to consider 
security, privacy, usability, 
and costs at the design stage, 
even before a system is built,” 
said Cai.

Wireless electricity eliminates tangled cords iPhone app saves a lifeduring Haiti earthquake
Soojin Yoon/Art Staff
Wireless electricity is based off the idea of energy conversion; electrical energy can be converted into different forms of energy, like magnetic 
energy, to send it wirelessly across distances. Wireless electricity may be common within the next few years.

A common fixture in any 
college dorm room is the 
overflowing power strip, with 
wires stretching across the 
room to power laptops, TVs, 
microwaves, and mini-fridges. 
This unavoidable disarray is 
common enough to be toler­
ated, but eliminating the need 
for wires is a thought that has 
probably crossed the minds of 
many individuals.
With current research in 
this field, however, this may 
become a reality in upcoming 
years.
Wireless electricity is based 
off a concept known as reso­
nant energy transfer, intro­
duced around 100 years ago 
by Nikola Tesla.
At TEDGlobal 2009, 
WiTricity CEO Eric Giler ex­
plained that a wire coil, called 
the power source coil, uses 
electricity to resonate at a very 
high frequency.
The energy from the coil’s 
resonance can then cause an­
other coil to resonate without 
having to physically touch the 
original coil.
The second coil is the pow­
er capture coil, which is made 
to resonate only at the same 
frequency as the power source 
coil.
If the two coils are placed 
close enough, the power
source coil will cause the pow­
er capture coil to resonate, 
and magnetic energy will 
transfer between them. This is 
the basis of wireless electricity 
transfer.
“The power source con­
verts the electricity into an 
oscillating magnetic field, and 
the magnetic field carries the 
energy from point A to point 
B, and at point B it’s converted 
from a magnetic field back into 
electricity,” explained David 
Schatz, director of business 
development and marketing 
at WiTricity.
Scientists at WiTricity state 
that wireless energy transfer 
will provide more than just 
convenience and better orga­
nization.
Many electronic devices 
today are powered by dispos­
able batteries, which are det­
rimental to the environment, 
cost-ineffective, and ineffi­
cient compared to many other 
sources of power, according to 
Giler.
In addition, batteries are 
often used around power 
sources. “By building an elec­
tricity power source into one 
of these heavy devices [like a 
computer] that’s around and 
happens to be plugged in, 
you can then use it in devices 
that are always used nearby 
[like an iPod or cell phone],”

When Dan Wooley was 
trapped under the rubble of 
the Hotel Montana in Port- 
au-Prince, Haiti, he had just 
about given up hope of sur­
vival.
With the millions affected 
by the earthquake, it would 
probably take several days 
for someone to find him in 
the ruins. Wooley was fight­
ing more than hunger, thirst, 
and exhaustion — he had to 
endure the cuts and bruises 
caused by the wreckage.
While Wooley didn’t have 
a surgeon on standby, he 
did have what now seems to 
be the next best thing: his
iPhone. It is no surprise that 
iPhones have the capability to 
provide an incredibly vast ex­
panse of information because 
the apps (one of the signature 
features of the iPhone) allow 
one to find any kind of spe­
cific knowledge instantly.
“I had an app that had pre­
downloaded all this informa­
tion about treating wounds. 
So I looked up excessive 
bleeding and I looked up 
compound fracture,” Wooley 
told CNN News. Forced to 
be resourceful, he ripped off 
his shirt, wrapped it around 
his leg as a bandage, and 
then used his belt as a make­
shift tourniquet. To stop

Plasma televisions: Combining chemistry and physics for entertainment

Plasma TVs rely on electrically charged gas to produce a current, which 
eventually causes the screen to display colors.
PRIYAMVADA GUPTA
Staffwriter
A plasma TV has a wide 
screen exactly like a conven­
tional television set, but one 
major difference from the 
hulking “big box” is that its 
thickness is only six inches. 
So much is managed in such a
small space because a plasma 
display illuminates small, col­
ored fluorescent lights to form 
an image, whereas old televi­
sion sets use a cathode ray 
tube (CRT) to form the same 
image.
A CRT is very bulky, and 
if the screen width has to be 
increased in a CRT television,
the length of the CRT also has 
to be increased. However, the 
fluorescent lights used in a 
plasma display occupy very 
little space and also result in a 
very high-quality display, un­
like CRT television sets.
Three types of fluorescent 
lights — red, blue, and green
— constitute a pixel. The in­
tensity of the different lights is 
varied by the plasma to obtain 
a vast range of colors as ob­
served on a colored television 
screen.
Plasma, as explained by 
www. plasm a tvscien ce. org, 
is the core element in a fluo­
rescent light. It is a gas that 
contains free-flowing ions and 
electrons.
Unlike normal conditions 
in which gases have uncharged 
particles, plasma does not have 
a net charge of zero because of 
the presence of charged par­
ticles like ions and electrons.
When free electrons are in­
troduced in a gas along with 
an electrical voltage, the atoms 
collide with the free electrons.
Consequently, other elec­
trons are knocked loose. When
an electron is knocked out, an 
atom becomes unbalanced 
and acquires a net positive 
charge; this is called a posi­
tively charged ion.
As electrical current runs 
through plasma, the principle 
of “opposite poles attract each 
other” applies. The positively 
charged particles rush toward 
the negatively charged area 
of the plasma, whereas the 
negatively charged particles 
are attracted by the positively 
charged area.
During this great' surge, 
particles keep on colliding 
with each other. As a result, 
the gas atoms present in the 
plasma get excited and pho­
tons of energy are released. 
The gas atoms are present in 
thousands of individual cells 
placed between two plates of 
glass.
The atoms used in plasma 
screen displays are xenon and 
neon atoms that release light 
photons upon excitation.
The light photons released 
have a wavelength that falls 
within the ultraviolet region of 
the electromagnetic spectrum,
and thus they are invisible to 
humans.
But these ultraviolet light 
photons help excite visible 
light photons from other at­
oms, which are visible to the 
human eye.
These ultraviolet photons 
interact with the walls of the 
cells, which are coated with 
phosphor. Phosphors are ma­
terials that emit light when 
exposed to the ultraviolet 
photons.
As soon as an ultraviolet 
light photon collides with a 
phosphor atom present in the 
wall of the cell, the atom gets 
heated up because its elec­
tron excites to a higher energy 
level.
A visible light photon is 
released when the electron 
falls back to its original energy 
level.
The different colors are ob­
tained because each phosphor 
emits a different colored light. 
Every pixel observed on the 
screen is constituted by three 
separate cells, each having a 
red-, blue-, and green-colored 
phosphor. These three colors
blend together with different 
intensities to create the pixel 
of a specific color.
The intensities of each cell 
can be increased or decreased 
by controlling the pulse of cur­
rent that flows through every 
cell.
Hundreds of different com­
binations of red, blue, and 
green light can give rise to 
colors across the entire visible 
spectrum.
The plasma television is 
unique because the technol­
ogy uses very thin materials to 
produce a wide screen.
The imagé is bright and 
looks the same from every 
angle because every pixel is lit 
individually.
The disadvantage of plas­
ma televisions is that they are 
highly expensive. According 
to www.Buy.com, however, 
as technology has advanced 
and demand has increased the 
prices have also dropped; this 
can be seen by comparing the 
prices from Î998 (when the 
first one was sold for $8000) 
to the prices today, when they 
cost just around $700.

Fusion experiment has promising results Gates Foundation donates $10 billion Evidence found for dinosaur skin color
Recent results from the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at 
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California in­
dicate that controlled fusion reactions may be within sight. A 
small-scale test of a hohlraum using a new technique of laser ad­
justment was 20 times the scale of previous experiments. Hohl- 
raums are hollow cylinders that focus incident laser beams into 
an extremely small area, thus concentrating enormous amounts 
of energy.
Researchers have been experimenting with fusion reactors 
for decades, but they have not yet been able to create one ca­
pable of producing an efficient amount of energy. Such a reactor 
would provide a plentiful and relatively clean energy source for 
commercial and scientific applications.
Nuclear fusion is the same way the sun produces its energy. If 
the scientists at the NIF are correct, an efficient reactor may be 
achieved before the end of the year. Even so, commercial reac­
tors would still be many years away.
In the largest charitable donation ever targeted at a specific 
goal, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced Friday 
that it was donating $10 billion to improve vaccination in de­
veloping and underdeveloped countries around the world. The 
specific goal of the foundation is reducing child mortality, with 
a target of immunizing 90 percent of children in the developing 
world. Such an effort will also require investment by many gov­
ernments, according to Gates.
The Gates Foundation plan aims to save the lives of 7.6 mil­
lion children by 2019. Many of these children require vaccines 
for diseases that are rare or easily treated in developed nations, 
such as tuberculosis and pneumonia.
The introduction of a malaria vaccine in the next five years 
could help an additional 1.1 million children. However, as Mar­
garet Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, 
stated, “The Gates Foundation’s commitment to vaccines is un­
precedented, but just a small part of what is needed.”
An article published Wednesday in the journal Nature gives 
some of the first convincing evidence for an accurate skin color­
ing of dinosaurs. Research done by a team of British and Chinese 
scientists, led by Michael Benton of the University of Bristol, 
used a technique previously developed for bird feathers to infer 
the appearance of dinosaurs while alive.
The color of the dinosaurs was inferred from tiny feathers 
present in the fossils. These feathers contained melanosomes, 
which are small structures containing pigment present in squid 
ink and many animals. By reconstructing dinosaurs’ pigmenta­
tion, the research team concluded that this particular species! 
of dinosaur, Sinosauropteryx, had an orange and white-striped 
tail.
Some paleontologists are still skeptical about the results, 
questioning whether dinosaurs without feathers also have mel­
anosomes. They also criticize the small sample size, which con­
sisted of only a few fossil remains.

Agnosia: Disorder affecting the ability to process sensory inputs
BRIAN LEE
SciTech Editor
although senses and memory are 
fully functional. As www.merck.com 
states, agnosia can be the result of 
brain damage or can be a birth de­
fect. While the mechanics of percep­
tion are still unknown, the regions of 
the brain that are affected have been 
identified.
Generally, agnosia patients have 
damage to the temporal lobe of the 
brain, which is associated with sen­
sory processing. The primary audito­
ry complex, which is responsible for 
processing sounds, is located in the 
temporal lobe. In addition, the tem­
poral lobe is involved in processing 
visual stimuli and language. Because 
of the versatility of the temporal lobe 
of the brain, damage to this region 
can cause many different varieties of 
agnosia.
According to www.psychnet-uk. 
com, the inability to recognize as­
pects of music is known as amusia; 
a mild and commonly known form is 
tone deafness, with which individu­
als cannot tell the difference between 
different pitches.
With apperceptive agnosia, pa­
tients cannot recognize objects, but 
they can describe them accurately. 
This kind of agnosia can be specific 
to certain kinds of objects, such as 
things that are living. Associative ag­
nosia is similar. Patients can catego­
rize objects, but cannot distinguish 
between objects.
Prosopagnosia is the inability to 
recognize faces — patients can no 
longer recognize friends or family. 
Other forms of agnosia have stranger 
symptoms. Some patients cannot dis­
tinguish between their own fingers; 
others can only recognize objects if 
they interact with them in a way oth­
er than sight, such as through touch­
ing or smelling. According to www. 
ninds.nih.gov, there are no cures for 
agnosia, although patients can un­
dergo therapy. For example, people 
with agnosia involving speech can 
be helped with speech therapy. How­
ever, research involving patients with 
agnosia can increase our knowledge 
of neurological pathways.
Psychologists are still trying to 
understand the cognitive processes 
involved with external stimuli. By re­
searching patients who do not have 
the full ability to manage their sens­
es, we might be able to understand 
which parts of the brain are needed 
and why.
If we see a metal fork on a table, 
we immediately recognize it as a fork. 
If we listen to our favorite song, we 
recognize the sounds as music. The 
ability to recognize environmental 
stimuli is something that comes natu­
rally to us.
But some people can see the fork 
on the table, and knowing that it’s 
silvery, metal, and something we eat 
with, conclude it is a spoon. Or if they 
hear a song, they cannot understand 
that what they are hearing is music.
Both of these bizarre conditions 
can be attributed to a brain disorder 
called agnosia, which is a general 
term describing an inability to recog­
nize anything from objects to sounds,
Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons
Brain damage to specific parts of the 
brain involved with the senses can cause 
agnosia. Agnosia is a mental disorder 
characetrized by the inability to recognize 
certain sensory inputs, including objects, 
sounds, and smells.
iPhone aids Haiti earthquake survivorWireless power for electronics
avoid the possibility of not 
making it out from under the 
rubble. Fearing the worst was 
close at hand, he turned to one 
of the other resources with 
him: his journal. Shedding 
tears and dripping blood, Dan 
Wooley wrote his final good­
bye to his family from under a 
collapsed hotel.
“I was in a big accident, an 
earthquake. Don’t be upset 
at God. He always provides 
for his children, even in hard 
times. I’m still praying that 
God will get me out, but he 
may not. But even so he will 
always take care of you,” 
Wooley wrote.
But Wooley didn’t need to 
say goodbye; he was rescued
60 hours after the building’s 
collapse. However, during 
those two and a half days 
of being trapped, he went 
through a roller coaster of 
emotions. Sometimes there 
were rescuers talking to those 
trapped, but other times he 
and other victims waited in si­
lence for hours on end, never 
knowing if they would survive 
until their saviors came.
Eventually, though, a crew 
came to pull the trapped lo­
cals from the rubble to safety. 
Wooley, looking back, gives 
thanks to God, but credit is 
also due to that little app on 
his iPhone that allowed him 
to help save himself.
Today, the iPhone, which 
is equipped With its many di­
verse apps, has become more 
than just a cell phone. Many 
apps have been programmed 
for the iPhone that assist with 
medical emergencies.
Airstrip OB is a childbirth 
app that sends a patient’s vi­
tals to their obstetrician.
Another app, called CPR 
& Choking, allows users to 
determine if others have life- 
threatening conditions, and if 
they require emergency medi­
cal care.
Emergency Radio can al­
low the iPhone to tune into 
emergency radio frequencies, 
which would be useful in any 
public emergency situation.
There are even apps de­
veloped for first aid for pets
— nothing is left out when it 
comes to iPhone apps.

a report from www.SFGate.

While this revolution­
ary technology is enticing, 
roadblocks do exist in its 
distribution. “It takes a while 
to convince companies to 
adopt something as radically 
new and different as this, 
because they have to change 
their products to incorpo­
rate it,” Schatz said. “And 
we have to take the technol­
ogy and develop it from some 
sort of laboratory scientific 
experiment to something that 
can be produced in the fac­
tory.”
It will take more improve­
ment before wireless electric­
ity devices will be able to be 
produced efficiently and cost- 
effectively.
In addition, there is a 
range limitation for powering 
devices. Schatz realizes that 
some devices will eventually 
need to move away from pow­
er sources.
“What we’ll be able to do
with those products is to be 
able to allow them to charge 
without having to be plugged 
in. In some cases you can di­
rectly power things if they 
happen to be always used in 
proximity to a source, and 
in other cases you can usu­
ally charge the devices when 
they’re in proximity to the 
source,” he said.
In short, wireless electric­
ity can be used to directly 
power larger appliances that 
are not mobile, like desktop 
computers, and can also be 
used to charge devices that 
can be taken anywhere, like 
cell phones.
Despite the current limita­
tions, we can expect to see this 
technology being implement­
ed in the very near future.
Schatz said that while the 
technology “is more of a con­
ceptual design, in 2010 the 
very first of our products will 
be shipped to customers in 
commercial and military ap­
plications. In the end of 2010 
and early 2011, it will start to 
be shipped in some consumer 
electronics applications.”
WIRELESS, from A4
.Schatz said, “and thus they 
don’t even need to have a bat­
tery.”
WiTricity, a company 
founded in 2007, is hoping to 
revolutionize the way elec­
tronics may be powered in the 
future.
The name WiTricity comes 
from “wireless” and “electrici­
ty,” which is a perfect descrip­
tion for their research.
Currently, the company is 
developing a method to safely 
power electronics without us­
ing wires.
. Other companies are work­
ing on different forms of wire­
less electricity, like WiPower, 
which hopes to be able to 
eharge devices wirelessly us­
ing a charging pad.
It may be shocking to think 
fhat power cords will someday 
be a thing of the past, but it 
has already been proven that 
this technology is functional.
Just recently, working with 
electronics manufacturer Hai- 
er, WiTricity showcased their 
product at the 2010 Consumer

rolled up one of his socks and 
pressed against it.
The life-saving app is called 
“Pocket First Aid & CPR” and 
is filled with information pro­
vided by the American Heart 
Association. Wooley said that 
the AHA’s affiliation allowed 
him to feel confident in the 
information he read. Another 
suggestion he took from the 
app was not to fall asleep, as 
he thought he might have suf­
fered from shock.
In response to that, Wool­
ey set his phone’s alarm to go 
off every 20 minutes. When 
his battery power eventually 
drained, he had no choice but 
to turn his phone off. Howev­
er, Wooley became so accus­
tomed to the habitually per­
sistent alarms that he claims 
he literally “had trained his 
body not to sleep for long pe­
riods, drifting off only to wake 
up within minutes.”

Since the $8 billion nonprofit an­
nounced on Oct. 16 that it would be

protesters to speak out against what 
they see as injustice being done to the 
community. People protesting the 
closure of UPMC Braddock — includ­
ing those activists dressed up as zom­
bies and others hosting a mock cor­
porate board meeting on the streets 
of downtown Pittsburgh — are com­
plaining that UPMC is abandoning 
the community of Braddock and that 
the closure is the result of corporate 
greed.
Beyond the closure of this branch 
alone, though, is the overarching na­
tionwide issue of closures of hospital 
branches in under-served neighbor­
hoods. While we recognize that run­
ning a hospital is a business opera­
tion like any other, there has to be an 
overhaul in the way health care is dis­
tributed and prioritized in the Pitts­
burgh area. Paul Wood, a spokesman 
for UPMC, told the Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette that the user rate of the Brad­
dock branch had declined “below lev­
els necessary to sustain it.”
But what about those people who 
moved to Braddock because of the 
once-promising branch? While pro­
testers initially called the closure il­
legal, a judge ruled Friday that it was 
not. Regardless of the legality of the 
issue, the fact is that the vastness of
the UPMC branches is known as an 
important aspect of our city’s empha­
sis on health care. If branches begin 
to close, succumbing to economic 
woes and leaving patients without 
immediate access to an emergency 
room, UPMC’s image as a prominent 
center of research and patient care 
could be negatively affected.
One benefit that will emerge from 
the closure of UPMC Braddock is its 
evolution into a space for high school 
classrooms. Students will be able 
to work hands-on in a real medical 
setting, hopefully better preparing 
them for careers in medicine. This 
long-term benefit to the community 
is indeed an important one, though 
prioritizing the long-term over the 
short-term may compromise Brad­
dock overall.
Bomb threat reveals lack of transparency
Around 1 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 22, 
cell phones went off in classrooms 
across campus. “Wean Hamerschlag
& Doherty Hall are being evacuatged 
[sic] for a security threat,” a univer­
sity-wide notification stated. In the 
hours following this message, mul­
tiple — although hardly informa­
tive — updates were posted on the 
University Alert website, and e-mails 
were sent to the campus community. 
But more than a week after much of 
our campus was evacuated, we have 
learned almost nothing that was not 
included in that original 80-charac­
ter alert.
Though everyone on campus has 
learned via rumor or fact that the 
“unconfirmed security threat” was
actually a bomb threat, the univer­
sity administration showed only a 
false transparency. Updates were 
sent during the situation, and we ap­
preciate the information we did get. 
Secrecy during an emergency situa­
tion is reasonable. However, while 
the knowledge that police swept 
the buildings and pronounced them 
clear was reassuring, it did not tell us 
the facts we wanted to know.
Without clear communication 
from the administration, there is no 
way to differentiate the truth from 
speculation. If a land purchase on 
Forbes Avenue warrants an exten­
sive explanation by President Cohon, 
surely a threat to our security—even 
a false threat — deserves more than
a couple of terse and ambiguous e- 
mails.
Even the communication the uni­
versity did provide would not have 
been effective in an actual crisis, 
where a rapid response is essential. 
The emergency alert system, which 
is ostensibly designed for situations 
just like these, did not notify some 
students by text message or phone 
call until more than half an hour af­
ter the original e-mail was sent and 
an hour after police first responded.
If Carnegie Mellon intends for 
students to trust its alert system, it 
must have a rapid, effective system 
of notification, and it must give stu­
dents enough information to make 
responsible decisions.
Obama must live up to spoken promises
President Obama has been in of­
fice for a year now, and accordingly 
graced our television screens last 
week to give the country his first 
State of the Union address.
The address was, as could be ex­
pected, a well-written, intellectual 
speech, delivered by a President who 
has deservedly retained his title as 
the best orator of our time. The talk 
was certainly meant to re-energize 
his base, his grassroots network of 
young, liberal Democrats.
The last year has been rife with 
criticism of Obama not actually ac­
complishing his campaign promises
— not just from Republicans and 
pundits, but from the egregiously lib­
eral media and even Saturday Night 
Live. Guantanamo Bay is still open, 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell has not been re­
pealed, large numbers of troops are 
still in Iraq, and the healthcare bill 
continues to stagnate in Congress.
This speech needed to discuss 
those policy issues, including the 
reasons the policies may not have 
moved forward as quickly as we may 
have hoped. He was able to critically 
discuss the actions and behavior of 
Congress, of the Supreme Court, and 
even of his own involvement in push­
ing policy into action.
While we understand that Obama 
is attempting to govern a legislative 
branch that has mastered the filibus­
ter, in a difficult economic climate 
(and a literally ever-more frighten­
ingly changing climate), we continue 
to hold him to the ideals he came in 
with. His speech brought back the 
optimism, the hope, but we will con­
tinue to push him for actual change.
In the end, the speech was just 
talk. As inspiring as Obama’s words 
can be, as President he must do 
more.
This was just another evening, 
just another speech, just another 
State of the Union that has come and 
gone. And possibly most important 
to America, it didn’t conflict with the 
season premiere of Lost. That would 
have been a big deal.
A vaiar deserves popularity for mix of marketing, tech

Whoever thought a movie about 
blue aliens would have movie buffs 
around the world up in arms? But 
so the world goes when James Cam­
eron tries to reassert himself as the 
king of the world.
With Avatar surpassing James 
Cameron’s previous work, Titanic, 
as the worldwide highest-grossing 
movie of all time this past week — 
and likely to pass the same mile­
stone for number one domestically 
in a few days — many have been 
grappling with what this actually 
means. Is Avatar really as good as its 
box office total? Is Avatar’s box office 
total even as good as it seems, after 
inflation and 3-D markup? I, with 
my amazing ability to cram large 
amounts of information into small 
places, will tackle these frequently 
asked Avatar questions (FAAQs) one 
by one.
FAAQ #1: Is Avatar really do­
ing as well as we think it is, after 
we take inflation and marked-up 
prices for 3-D?
The way inflation is getting 
thrown around as a blanket dis­
counter is very problematic. Infla­
tion is working against all of us, I 
know, but let’s analyze this with a 
more discerning eye. Back in 1965, 
people were lining up to buy tickets 
for box office legend The Sound of 
Music at an average price of $1. Ac­
cording to dollartimes.com, some­
thing that was priced at $1 in 1965 
costs $6.92 today. Meanwhile, the 
average ticket price has risen to 
$7.46 since 1965. Ticket prices are 
increasing faster than the rest of 
what we purchase.
At first this may seem like fruit for 
the argument that inflation is boost­
ing Avatar’s total gross. But as any­
one with some economics savvy can 
tell you, this could in fact dissuade 
many people from purchasing mov­
ie tickets with cheaper entertain­
ment alternatives to pursue. If you 
now consider that the 3-D tickets 
are marked up more than their 2-D 
counterparts, you can see there is a 
huge pressure on viewers not only 
against watching Avatar, but com­
ing back to watch it again in 3-D.
FAAQ #2: Does Avatar really 
deserve to be the highest-grossing 
movie of all time? Aren’t people 
watching Avatar just because of 
the novelty of 3-D?
The question of whether or not 
Avatar deserves its box office gross 
Is, well, quite hilarious. Did Wayne 
Gretzky deserve to score more goals 
than anyone in the history Of his 
sport? Does Joe Smith deserve it 
when he gets a 100 percent on an 
exam?
Many feel Avatar has an unfair
advantage over past movies due to 
its groundbreaking 3-D experience. 
This is barely a half-truth.
Avatar is probably one of the 
greatest fusions we have seen of 
technology and well-executed story­
telling. Where many big-budget films 
flop in the storytelling department 
(see Transformers, and the most re­
cent Spider-Man and Star Wars in­
stallments), Cameron is able to fuse 
the 3-D experience with the story he 
is trying to tell, instead of allowing 
one to shortchange the other.
Resisting the urge to create gim­
micky 3-D scenes with the purpose 
of shocking the audience, Cameron 
utilizes the third dimension to subtly 
accentuate the background of each 
scene. This would have taken as 
much creative thought as the angle 
of the camera, the prose of the dia­
logue, or the approach of the actors.
In short, technology is as much 
a part of the creative cinematic pro­
cess as any other aspect. And that 
Avatar pioneers this new facet and 
sets the bar for the future does give 
it an advantage over other films, 
although not an unfair one at all. 
Movie-making is about innovation, 
and never has the use of special ef­
fects been considered to be outside 
the lines.
FAAQ #3: But is Avatar really 
that good? Is it really one of the 
greatest movies of all time?
These questions are starting to 
get a little too personal. But this 
has been a fairly angst-ridden topic. 
Somehow, somewhere along the 
line, the idea of box office gross has 
gotten blurred with artistic merit. 
In the „top 25 movies by gross, you 
can find The Godfather at number
21, with no appearance by Citizen 
Kane or Casablanca. These mov­
ies are widely considered to be the 
three greatest films of all time. The 
Phantom Menace grossed more than 
all three of these! <
The amount of money a movie 
grosses is a marriage between good 
marketing and having strong ap­
peal across all demographics, rather 
than artistic merit. The subtleties pf 
a Coppola or Scorsese film that get 
movie-critic purists drooling aren’t 
necessarily what moviegoers are 
looking for.
James Cameron has realized this 
once again, wedding a tried-and- 
true human storyline with never- 
before-seen movie technology, 
while creating as much hype as;he 
could muster. Moviegoers want to 
see something new, while being told 
something that they believe dearly 
to be true. They can get all of this 
with a ticket to Avatar, no matter 
what the price.

Blood donation should not be subject to prejudice
* “I make a difference!” states a 
sticker a friend of mine received at 
the recent American Red Cross blood 
drive. However, my friend didn’t wear 
the sticker; instead it’s now stuck in­
side the back cover of his textbook. 
It’s a bit ironic that my friend has this 
sticker cheerfully announcing the 
nobility of his acts, considering the 
fact that his blood was rejected. The 
sticker didn’t exactly serve its pur­
pose; however, the form he received 
titled “Indefinite Deferral” certainly 
did. The form made it very clear that 
my friend cannot give blood because 
he is gay.
J The Food and Drug Adminis­
tration's (FDA) Indefinite Deferral 
Policy has permanently barred any 
man who has had sex with another 
man (even once) since 1977 from 
‘donating blood. Even more shocking 
is the fact that this ban has been in 
place for over 20 years — it was put 
m place in 1983, the first year of the 
AIDS crisis.
The American Red Cross, the Amer­
ican Association of Blood Banks, 
and America’s Blood Centers, which
collect almost all the blood used for 
transfusions nationwide, have all 
stepped up to argue for an end to the 
policy. However, in 2007 the FDA 
chose to uphold the ban. According 
to the FDA, the ban is in place be­
cause “a history of male-to-male sex 
is associated with an increased risk 
for the presence of and transmission 
of certain infectious diseases, includ­
ing HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.”
For my friend, and for many other 
students on campus and around the 
country, this policy is an act of out­
right discrimination. In 1977, when 
the ban was created, it may have been 
warranted. However, to continue that 
ban today is a ridiculous act of stereo­
typing — especially considering the 
FDA’s policies for other groups. Most 
high-risk groups are deferred for one 
year — a time frame that is minus­
cule in comparison to the indefinite 
deferral gay men receive. Even het­
erosexual individuals who have had 
sex with an HIV-positive partner are 
allowed to donate blood after a one- 
year deferral period.
This is an especially relevant ques­
tion when the current HIV/AIDS test­
ing procedures are considered. The 
HIV tests currently in use are incred­
ibly accurate — the chances of a false 
negative are less than one per 2 mil­
lion in the United States, according 
to the FDA’s statistics.
Carnegie Mellon plans to host
11 blood drives this year. For many 
students, these blood drives will rep­
resent bigotry and prejudice. With 
blood shortages across the globe — 
especially in devastated areas of Haiti
— it’s ridiculous that the blood banks 
would turn down perfectly healthy,
acceptable blood. All healthy stu­
dents should have the opportunity to 
give blood, regardless of their sexual 
orientation. All students should have 
the opportunity to “make a differ­
ence.”

Saving face: Chinese, U.S. cultures have unique history
M I arrived last summer in Shanghai 
as the individualist American most 
of us are brought up to be: Chinese 
books in one hand and the Constitu­
tion in the other. I made sure to edu­
cate myself on all the current issues 
of the place that would be my home 
"for the next two months. I read about 
censorship issues, the Communist 
‘Party’s tortures, the disappearance 
of1 Chinese civil rights lawyer Gao 
Zhisheng exactly one year ago from 
this week (Feb. 2, 2009) after docu­
menting victims’ accounts of physi­
cal and verbal abuse. I witnessed 
'firsthand the week-long shutdown of 
Google, the moment from when Fa- 
cfebook was no longer available, and I 
had to replace YouTube, also banned, 
with the Chinese version Youku.
“Keep your broken arm inside 
your sleeve.” —Chinese proverb 
j^It is no longer only speculation 
that China may very well be tak­
ing center stage with extraordinary 
power and influence — it is merely 
common knowledge now. The United
States has gradually been stripped of 
the international attention it is used 
to. However, hard set on the values 
that we feel have historically made 
the U.S. the “land of opportunity” 
it is, we have remained insistent on 
the spread of democracy dictated by 
Manifest Destiny: In other words, it’s 
not our fault God chose us to save the 
world.
Hillary Clinton sure seems to 
think so, as in a speech a couple of 
weeks ago, she listed China among 
the nations that engage in massive 
censorship of the information they 
make available to the public and thus 
pose a threat to international secu­
rity. She went on to urge the Chinese 
government not only to conduct in­
vestigations on the recent attacks on 
Google, but also to make the findings 
available to the public. Is it not per­
haps a tad pretentious of Clinton to 
expect the Chinese government with 
its centuries of history to have a spon­
taneous epiphany: “You know what, 
Hillary, I hadn’t thought of that.... 
Thanks for showing us the light.”
An official Chinese newspaper 
commented on Clinton’s speech sev­
eral days later, calling it “a part of the 
U.S. campaign to impose its values
and denigrate other cultures by ex­
ploiting their societies’ vulnerabili­
ties....” '
We all agree that everyone de­
serves to have access to the truth; 
nevertheless, could it also be possible 
that the Chinese government acted 
negatively due to feelings of pub­
lic humiliation? And perhaps we’ve 
found the problem.
“Do not remove a fly from a 
friend’s forehead with a hatchet.” 
—Chinese proverb
Last summer in Shanghai, my 
teacher — native Chinese — ex­
plained to us one day in class that 
among the many social priorities of 
Chinese society, one proves as true 
today as it did hundreds of years ago: 
“saving face.” “Face” refers to the per­
spective you build of yourself within 
public opinion — it is the image we 
construct of ourselves before others. 
My teacher went on to explain that 
in China, there is no greater sign of 
disrespect than publicly humiliat­
ing another. Obama promised in his 
campaign to improve U.S.-China ties, 
but we should be careful that upon 
removing the fly from our friend’s 
forehead, we don’t strip off their face 
in the process.
It seems clear to me at first sight 
that the recent Google.cn dispute 
was inevitable: The threat to the 
Chinese government’s control seems 
to be directly proportional to the 
growth of the population and the 
development of its society. In today’s 
globalizing international commu­
nity, where open access to the inter­
national network and socioeconomic 
progress seem to go hand in hand, 
it’s only a matter of time before the 
steady development of Chinese soci­
ety grows too much for the inflexible 
skin of communism to contain.
Like most Americans, I was 
brought up assuming my natural 
rights to free speech and the chase 
of my own dreams — cultivating my 
individuality. It never occurred to 
me that it might not be the case for 
everyone; we often fail to remember 
that the founding fathers didn’t tour 
the planet: Different countries have 
unique customs and laws. In the case 
of how each individual society devel­
ops in the specific way that it does, 
history does not always repeat itself.

LEADERS,HIP PERSPECTIVESThe Tartan works with community
With the beginning of a new se­
mester and year, The Tartan looks 
forward to a fresh start with a new 
editorial staff, and as publisher 
and editor-in-chief, Kristen and I 
have our own goals for the paper. 
We believe that it is essential that 
The Tartan strongly represent our 
campus community, and this is 
among our goals for the semester.
Currently, our staff represents 
our campus’s diverse student pop­
ulation, but with fresh recruitment 
we hope to expand our organiza­
tion. Also, by featuring columns 
like Tales from Abroad in Pillbox 
and Athlete Profile in Sports, The 
Tartan aims to personalize content 
and add a face to the article.
In the days to come, we are 
happy to announce that read­
ers will be able to see a more ac­
tive representation of our campus 
through The Tartan’s collaboration 
with other student organizations. 
We have formalized a partnership 
with cmuTV that will allow read­
ers to view not just photos, but 
videos of events on The Tartan 
website (www.thetartan.org). Our 
first such multimedia venture will 
be the coverage of Bhangra in the 
Burgh, so watch for video clips of 
the competition accompanying a 
review of the event.
Kristen and I also think it is im­
portant for us to reach out to our 
sister campus in Doha, Qatar and 
allow for different perspectives in 
the newspaper. With this objective 
in mind, we have finalized an ar­
ticle exchange with CMU-Q’s pub­
lication the All Around in the hope 
that this new content will keep us 
updated on what’s happening on 
the other side of the world.
As the semester progresses, we 
are excited to see our alliances 
with cmuTV and the All Around 
grow, and hope that we can forge 
lasting partnerships with more 
campus organizations as we strive 
to represent and be more active in 
the Carnegie Mellon community.
My (pseudo-)Snuggie ownership: A personal journey in fashion
u.
My mother got my family a set of 
Snuggies for Christmas.
•*" Actually, they weren’t the Snug- 
gie™ blankets, per se, but a pretty 
accurate imitation from the Bed and 
Bath section of Macy’s. They were 
your average quilt-like material on 
the outside and cotton-flannel inside, 
with an array of strategically placed 
buttons holding the whole thing to­
gether. They came in a large card­
board box, using up a fair amount of
wrapping paper. It’s ironic to think 
that a garment whose purpose is to 
swaddle you was over-swaddled in 
holiday packaging. I wasn’t too con­
vinced at the beginning.
In any case, never in my life would 
I have thought that I would be a 
Snuggie-imitator owner. They looked 
ridiculous in the infomercials, but, 
maybe that’s just an indication of my 
snobbery. I wasn’t quite convinced by 
a garment that was halfway between 
a classy living room throw blanket 
and nightwear pajamas, but that’s 
probably just an indication of my 
non-acceptance. Plus, as a Carnegie 
Mellon student, I couldn’t imagine
getting that comfortable — sitting on 
a cushy couch, wrapped in warm, soft 
material, leisurely reading a maga­
zine. Snuggies were impractical gar­
ments for an unattainable lifestyle, so 
I dismissed them.
Until they showed up under my 
Christmas tree. Wanting to be an 
informed Snuggie owner, I fully re­
searched all the uses, benefits, and 
risks. The official Snuggie website 
proclaims that their product is perfect 
for sporting events, chilly office build­
ings, and... nighttime pub crawls? 
Needless to say, I took some of their 
suggestions and ignored others. But if 
anyone sees Snuggied-up bar-goers in
PHI Bar anytime, please inform me.
The official Snuggie website also 
featured nice pictures of people and 
their Snuggies in a natural environ­
ment. Which means, of course, that 
the pictures were just beautifully 
staged. They showed a good-looking 
couple enjoying a date night by the 
fire, a mother reading to her child, 
and a woman on a plane.
I knew I could never attain the 
idyllic lives of those Snuggie owners, 
which is probably why I’m a pseudo- 
Snuggie owner. While the original 
Snuggie is somewhat figure-conform- 
ing, my pseudo-Snuggie was basically 
a quilt folded over twice with holes
for my arms and head. It was kind 
of funny-looking, and thus I never 
would wear it outside of immediate 
family, but I grew to like it over time. 
You could never take it camping or ac­
tually sleep with it, but the idea grew 
on me, and before long I became at­
tached to it. It is actually quite warm, 
which is the primary reason my moth­
er got them and immediately lowered 
the thermostat to a cool 60 degrees.
“It was the best $19.95 I’ve ever 
spent,” my mother said. “Saves a 
bunch on our heating bills.”

Sophomore Hannah ponzalez competes in the 200-yard butterfly against Denison on Saturday. Gonzalez 
kfinished fourth in thf event.\SWIM, from A10
of 54.40. To enid the meet, the 
team of seniors Jeff Dahlen 
and Scott Moorby, junior Josh 
Matthews, and sophomore 
Matt Stanton won the 200- 
j^rd freestyle relay with a 
&2907. nSophomore Mike Alex- 
.giich won the one-meter div­
ing while senior Matt Kuhn 
won the three-meter event 
with a score of 225.65. Both 
| Spring and Evans garnered 
* UAA Athlete of the Week hon- 
"5 for their performances. 
Saturday marked the final 
home mea for the Taitan se- 
iors as they took ; on Deni- 
sBn.
Before the meet started, 
the team took a moment to 
recognize Altman-Kurosaki, 
Dahlen, Jason Huber, Kuhn, 
Moorby, Spring, Gates Win- 
fcMr, Andrews, and senior 
Christine Anderson for their 
contributions to the team over 
their careers.

best swims, as Stillo took sec­
ond in the 100-yard breast­
stroke with a time of 1:08.22, 
Adams’ season-best 10:48.64 
in her 1000-yard freestyle got 
second place, and Evans’ 500- 
yard freestyle time of 5:01.36 
was also a season best.
“I think this weekend we 
swam really well,” Evans said. 
“Although Denison is a strong 
team, we were able to chal­
lenge them in a lot of races. 
Despite the fact that both 
teams lost, I think we had 
some outstanding in-season 
swims on both sides and re­
ally got up to race Denison for 
our last home meet.”
For the men, Altman- 
Kurosaki won the 1000-yard 
freestyle in a time of 9:46.52. 
Spring 6nded his home ca­
reer with a bang, breaking 
the 10-minute barrier for the 
first time as he touched third 
in 9:57.57.
“I was really happy with 
how the senior meet went, 
even if it was a loss,” Spring 
said. “We had some 
swims and are posed to 
we^ at' ouffi^er’ii^l 
coming weeks.”
For the remaining events, 
Dahlen touched in second in 
the 200-yard backstroke With
a time of 1:56.46 and Huber 
placed second in the 100-yard 
breaststroke in 1:00.32. Gla- 
ser-Garbrick dominated both 
the 200- and 100-yard but­
terfly with times of 1:54.52 
and 51.73, respectively. Yee 
touched second in both the 
200-yard free and fly before 
sprinting the last four laps of 
his 500-yard freestyle to seal a 
comeback victory.
“I’m really going to miss 
the whole team,” Huber said 
after the meet. “I feel like a fa­
ther to tliese kids. I know that 
we are beiflg smiled upon and 
have been blessed to finish out 
this season with a bang.”
Yee couldn’t Help but echo 
Huber’s sentiments. “It’s 
definitely not going to be the 
same next year without these 
guys,” he said with watery 
eyes. “This team feels like my 
family, and it’s tough thinking 
about not having our eldest 
mentors with us next year.”
The Tartans will face off at 
the University of Pittsburgh 
on Saturday before heading 
to Atlanta for the University 
Atltletic Association Champi­
onships on Thursday.

foul line four times but were 
only able to convert on two of 
the opportunities, tying the 
score at 67-67 with just 6.2 
seoonds left on the clock. The 
few seconds were just enough 
for the Pioneers to get off one 
final shot to come away with 
ayictory.
„'•“We came out strong and 
wore shooting really well 
from the field early in the first 
half,” said Pettit, who led the 
Tartans with 16 points. “Put­
ting two solid halves together 
is;, something we have been 
struggling with this year, and 
we,need to figure out a way to 
maintain the momentum.” 
u During the weekend of 
Jqn. 22, the Tartans hosted 
Upiversity Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA) opponents Univer­
sity of Chicago and Washing­
ton University in St. Louis. On
in
t, the Tartans dropped a 
71-57 decision to the Maroons 
of Chicago. The Maroons took 
control of the game from the 
start, going on a 12-0 run, 
and maintained the lead for 
the rest of the game. Sopho­
more John Duhring led the 
Tartans with 13 points, fol­
lowed by junior Shane Rife 
with 10 points.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
were unable to rebound from 
Friday’s loss and dropped an 
81-60 decision to the Bears 
of Washington University. The 
loss put the Tartans at 0-5 in 
league play while the Bears 
moved to 4-1. The Tartans 
only took the lead once during 
the game and shot 30.8 per­
cent from the field. Duhring 
once again led the Tartans 
with 17 points, followed by 
Pettit, who finished with 13.
After a week of practice, 
the Tartans traveled to New
York and Boston for another 
UAA weekend. On Friday the 
Tartans lost a close game to 
New York University, falling 
59-57.
The loss was a back-and- 
forth game with four lead 
changes in the second half 
alone, but the Violets were 
able to hold off the Tartans 
for the last 1:24 to come away 
with the victory.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
lost their seventh straight 
UAA game, falling to Brandeis 
University 72-59. Senior Jack 
Anderson led the Tartans with 
15 points, followed by Pettit, 
who cashed in for 14.
The Tartans are now 4-14 
overall and 0-7 in league 
play.
The team will be back in 
action next weekend as the 
Tartans take on New York Uni­
versity and Brandeis in Skibo 
Gymnasium.
Tartans shine against Case Western
TRACK, from A10 
¦ " ' Mattingly clocked in the Tar­
tans’ only individual running 
victory of the day with a time 
of 1:03.18 in the 400-meter 
dash, and was also part of the 
winning 4x400-meter relay 
team. Moses and sophomore 
Luci Laffitte were able to one- 
two the long jump (4.98 and 
4.89 meters, respectively), 
and Moses and junior Melissa 
Hwang took top two in the tri­
ple jump (10.4 and 9.92 me­
ters), but it was not enough to 
overcome the deficit, as Case 
took the top two places in sev­
eral events and took top four 
in the 500-meter.
“Although it was only our 
second meet of the season, 
this was a very competitive 
meet for us because we’re go­
ing up against another team 
in our UAA conference,” said 
Abimbola, who took fourth 
in the 20-meter dash. “This 
was the second annual ‘Steel 
Town Showdown,’ as Case 
Western likes to call it, and
we were pumped to go head 
to head with them and push 
ourselves. We would have 
all liked to win, but we also 
realized that this was only 
our second meet and that we 
would try our best.”
Abimbola then added, 
“Case Western can have the 
trophy this year, but they 
shouldn’t be fooled because 
we still have a long way to
go.”
Despite winning nine of 
15 events, the men ultimately 
fell short as Case made sure to 
stay close behind their com­
petitors, only allowing the 
Tartans to one-two an event 
twice. The Tartans did the 
same to their foes for the most 
part, but Case was able to 
take the top four spots in the 
80-meter to run up the points 
on their side. Titus and Mus- 
selman once again took the 
20-meter (23.75) and 40-me­
ter (51.74), respectively, while 
Bussiere took the mile and 
Allera won the 500-meter. 
Hulley continued to dominate
the shot put with a winning 
distance of 15.34 meters; he 
took second to senior team­
mate Chris Fornataro in the 
weight throw.
Despite the team’s loss, 
Hulley echoed Abimbola’s 
sentiments that the focus is 
more on individual perfor­
mance. “For the entire year 
except for UAA’s at the end 
of the season, there is no im­
portance to team scoring.... 
Most of the year is focused 
on developing individually 
in competitions so that when 
the UAA meet rolls around, 
you are able to go out there 
and compete hard with your 
team in a meet where place is 
everything and it’s all about 
the team. I take a great deal of 
pride performing well when 
my team is really counting on 
it.”
Both teams will head back 
to Ohio for the fourth straight 
weekend to compete this Sat­
urday at Mount Unfon Col­
lege.

The women’s basketball team files out of Skibo Gymnasium during halftime. The Tartans had tough luck 
against their fellow UAA counterparts, with a UAA record of 1-6.
BASKETBALL, from A10
Wash. U., 57-64. Aunkst 
tied the school record with a 
tally of six three-point shots, 
adding to her career-high 24 
points. First-year forward 
Emily Peel added 11 points, 
and fifth-year senior Rachelle 
Roll grabbed 15 rebounds for 
her season high. Despite the 
loss, Roll commented that 
“the team morale is up after 
our hard-fought game against 
Washington University. See­
ing that we can compete and 
have the ability to beat the 
number-three team in the 
country is extremely promis­
ing, and we just need to work 
on our consistency and get 
better every day.”
The Tartans dropped a 62- 
78 setback at NYU on Friday. 
Though the Violets led by as 
much as 20 points in the first 
half, Peel scored eight straight 
points to help the Tartans cut
the lead to 23-36 by halftime. 
Out of the halftime break, Car­
negie Mellon pulled within 10 
points (51-41) with 11:23 left 
in the game, but was never 
able to make any more head­
way as the Violets went on a 
12-0 run and ended the game 
up 16, 62-78.
On Sunday, Carnegie Mel­
lon travelled to Brandeis. 
Both teams were streaky, but 
the Tartans lost in a com­
petitive 58-70 decision. The 
squad jumped out to a quick 
7-6 lead before Brandeis an­
swered with nine points to 
make the score 7-15 with 13 
minutes left in the first half.
The Tartans responded 
with a run of their own and 
narrowed the lead to 13-15. 
Roll accounted for four of 
Carnegie Mellon’s points dur­
ing the streak.
By halftime, Brandeis held 
a seven-point lead over the 
Tartans, 30-33. Peel led Car­
negie Mellon with eight first- 
half points.
Brandeis went on a three- 
minute, 7-2 run to start the 
new half and took a 32-40 
lead. The Tartans answered 
with six points, cutting the 
score to 38-40. With 7:33 
left in the game, Roll assisted 
sophomore guard Nicole Vac- 
carella in a backdoor lay-up to 
make the score 49-52. Bran­
deis then scored the next nine 
points to extend the lead to 
49-61.
The Tartans went on their 
final run, making the score 
54-61. However, the effort 
was fruitless as Brandeis took 
the game, 58-70. Aunkst 
scored 11 points, while Roll, 
Vaccarella, and Larsen scored 
10. Roll also grabbed nine re­
bounds.
The Tartans’ next game 
is at 6 p.m. on Friday as they 
take on NYU at home in Skibo 
Gym.
Life is calling. 
How far will you go?Tennis on Campus offers friendly and intercollegiate competitive play for students
*. COURTNEY CHIN
Sports-Editor
* Jf one were to walk by the 
tennis courts at any time of 
day, one would see students 
and faculty alike engaging 
in friendly competition with 
their friends. Now those ten­
nis enthusiasts can have one 
more reason to love the sport: 
the beginning of the Tennis On 
Campus program. According 
to the national organization’s 
press release, the Tennis On 
Campus program is “offered 
on over 500 college campuses 
with over 30,000 participat­
ing students” and will allow 
players from Carnegie Mel­
lon to compete against other 
teams from across the coun­
try. The United States Tennis 
Association (USTA) — which 
helps regulate all things ten­
nis-related, from local tourna­
ments to the U.S. Open — has 
now brought Carnegie Mellon 
into the fold with its new pro­
gram.
The main objective of 
the program is to organize 
non-varsity tennis players to 
compete in dual matches and 
travel to schools such as Penn 
State, Drexel, and Bucknell. 
“[Carnegie Mellon’s] tennis 
program overall is very strong, 
so there are a lot of great play­
ers ... who aren’t on a varsity
team but still enjoy playing 
at a slightly more than recre­
ational level,” said Jennifer 
Marlow, a Ph.D. student and 
a captain and event organizer 
for the Tennis Club. For each 
dual match, the 10-person 
coed team will play a total of 
five matches: men’s singles 
and doubles, women’s singles 
and doubles, and a mixed 
doubles match to round out 
the play.
“We’d like to establish 
CMU as a competitive force in 
the club tennis community,” 
Marlow said. “As the team 
continues to grow, we hope to 
increase awareness and par­
ticipation among interested
players at CMU, and to have 
fun while doing so.”
Sophomore Wei Guo, the 
other captain and event orga­
nizer for the Tennis Club, add­
ed, “We just started participat­
ing last year, so we are happy 
with the turnout. We felt like 
we formed a good team to be 
competitive, and we had some 
good matches against Pitt and 
Duquesne. We feel we can 
compete for the title.”
If Carnegie Mellon’s team 
does exceptionally well this 
year, it has the chance to 
qualify for the USTA Nation­
al Campus Championship, 
which will be held in April in 
Surprise, Ariz.

The Carnegie Mellon swim­
ming and diving team traveled 
to New Wilmington, Pa. on 
Jan. 23 for a dual meet with 
Westminster College. Both 
the Tartan men and women 
won the meet, with scores of 
183-113 and 181-110, respec­
tively. The Tartans then came 
home to host Denison Univer­
sity this past Saturday for their 
last home meet of the season. 
They fell 80-217 pn the wom­
en’s side, while the men’s team 
lost 164-135.
The women’s team started 
out the meet well with the 
relay team of junior Molly 
Evans, first-year Dorothy Yu, 
sophomore Hannah Gonza­
lez, and senior Sara Andrews 
winning the 400-yard medley 
relay with a time of 4:05.68. 
Individual highlights for the 
women’s team were Evans, 
who won the 200-yard free-
style with a time of 1:58.12, 
and Andrews, who touched in 
second at 1:59.39. Evans also 
won the 200-yard backstroke

The women’s basketball 
team finished a competitive 
two weeks — and the first 
half — of University Athlet­

play, squaring off against the 
University of Chicago, Wash­

and Brandeis University.
Although the Tartans tal­
lied four tough losses, the 
team remains confident for 
the second half of UAAs. Car­

8-10 overall and 1-6 in the 
UAA.
The squad lost at home to 
Chicago on Jan. 22, 51-76. 
Sophomore guard Ali Aunkst

Individual success aplenty 
in Ohio for track and field
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s.track and 
field teams were in an Ohio 
state of mind the past two 
weekends. On Jan. 23, they 
traveled to Granville to com­
pete in Denison University’s 
Lid-Lifter Invitational before 
traveling to Cleveland to take 
on Case Western Reserve Uni­
versity in a Jan. 30 dual meet. 
Both teams had much success 
at the Denison invitational be­
fore falling to Case, 63-64 on 
the men’s side and 40-86 on 
the women’s.
Seven men won events for 
the Tartans at Denison, high­
lighted by senior James Hul- 
ley’s 16.12-meterperformance 
in the shot put. The distance is
0.58 meters farther than the 
NCAA Division III provisional 
qualifying distance and gives 
Hulley a very good shot to 
make the NCAA Champion­
ships. The performance also 
garnered Hulley his second 
straight UAA Athlete of the 
Week award.
“So far I have been happy 
with my performance this 
season,” Hulley said. “I’ve 
provisionally qualified for the 
NCAA Indoor National Cham­
pionships already in shot put 
and will probably make it 
with my distance. Last indoor 
season, I qualified in the sec­
ond-to-last meet, and it was 
very stressful leading up to 
finally throwing it that far. Be­
ing there already, I feel much 
more relaxed in my training 
and competitions, and I think 
that will ultimately lead to 
success at the national level, 
whereas last year I choked.”
In other field events, ju­
niors Pat O’Brien and Mike To- 
movich each cleared a height 
of 1.83 meters in the high 
jump, with O’Brien ulitmately 
being awarded first place on a 
judges’ decision. O’Brien also 
took second in the 55-meter 
hurdles with a time of 8.46 
seconds. Winners for the Tar­
tans in the running events 
included first-year Noel Titus 
(200-meter, 23.28), sopho­
more Rob Morhard (800-me- 
ter, 2:00.60), and juniors 
Dustin Musselman (400-me- 
ter, 52.99), Nate Bussiere 
(one mile, 4:24.88), and J.P. 
Allera (3000-meter, 9:08.73). 
The men’s team also domi­
nated the 4x400-meter relay, 
with their A, B, and C teams 
taking the top three spots and 
their A team (O’Brien, first- 
year Daniel Ching, Titus, and 
Musselman) finishing almost 
15 seconds (3:36.90) ahead 
of fourth-place Washington 
and Jefferson.
The women also managed 
seven victories at the Lid- 
Lifter, with multiple victories 
from sophomore Ivana Moses
and senior Diane Mattingly. 
Moses crossed in eight sec­
onds flat to win the 55-meter 
dash, 0.24 seconds ahead of 
senior teammate Timi Abim­
bola, who finished third. Mo­
ses’ distance of 4.94 meters 
in the long jump and 10.10 
meters in the triple jump were 
also good enough to win. Mat­
tingly was able to take first 
in both the 200-meter and 
400-meter dashes with times 
of 28.76 and 1:02.68. Junior 
teammate Courtney Baker 
crossed fifth in the 200-me­
ter, only 0.81 seconds behind 
Mattingly, but was victorious 
in the 800-meter run with 
a time of 2:22.51. First-year 
Emily Wobb rounded out the 
individual victories for the 
Tartans by completing the 
3000-meter run in 11:08.93, 
over 45 seconds ahead of 
the second-place finisher. 
Mattingly, Moses, and Baker 
were also part of the Tartans’ 
first-place 4x200-meter relay, 
joined by senior Crystal Lee- 
Pow.
Against Case,“ the women 
couldn’t replicate their success 
despite some better individual 
performances. Moses’ time of
7.90 seconds in the 55-meter 
dash was good enough for 
fourth behind junior team­
mate Kim Nederlof (3rd, 7.78) 
and two Case competitors.

Over the past two weeks, 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team played five 
hard-fought games but were 
unable to snap an 11-game 
losing streak.
On Jan. 19, it appeared as 
though the Tartans were go­
ing to come away with a home
victory against the Pioneers of 
Marietta, but were beat by an 
eight-foot shot at the buzzer. 
The 69-67 loss dropped the 
Tartans to 4-10 while the Pio­
neers moved to an even 8-8.
The Tartans came out hot, 
going on a 12-0 run and sink­
ing 100 percent of their first 
seven shots. Junior Matt Pettit 
led the charge, scoring nine 
of the team’s first 12 points.
With 5:36 remaining in the 
first half, it looked as though 
the Tartans were going to 
have a big lead going into the 
break, but a 17-2 run by the 
Pioneers put them just one 
point behind the home team 
at the end of the half. With just 
one minute remaining in the 
game, the Tartans went to the

With a solid season in the making, the 
men’s swimming and diving team has had 
a strong performance from its members so 
far this year. Currently holding a record of 
7-3, the Tartans have one last meet at the 
University of Pittsburgh next weekend be­
fore the conference and national champion­
ship competition begins. Last semester, ju­
nior Alex Hanson was named the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) Men’s Swim­
ming Athlete of the Week and has been con­
tributing to the team’s success ever since. 
Hanson has been a contender at the Nation­
al Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) 
Championship meet the past two years and 
hopes to return again this year and perform 
well enough to place in the top 16.
When he is out of the water and not try­
ing to break 4:00 in the 400-yard IM, Han­
son is majoring in mechanical engineering. 
He notes that while his interest in coming 
to Carnegie Mellon was mainly for its top-
10 academics, a college with a swim team 
was essential to his decision about where to 
go for college. Hanson finds a good balance 
between his full schedule of course work, 
practices, and swim meets. Hanson shared, 
“Swimming is a great stress reliever. There’s 
nothing like a hard practice to help you for­
get about failing a test. Although swimming 
takes up a large portion of my day, it has al­
ways helped me focus out of the pool.”
Hanson started swimming in a local 
swim club back home in Minnesota at the 
age of seven at the suggestion of his swim 
lesson instructor. Luckily for the Tartans, he
star swimmer
decided to stick with it. An interesting side 
note is that Hanson’s favorite food to eat 
post-swim meet is ice cream: “...it’s a great 
source of carbohydrates, protein, and fat
— swimmers need their calories.” Hanson 
looks to keep training hard and improving 
his times, and seems to be right at home at 
Carnegie Mellon as both a student and an 
athlete. I

Seminar provides advice on how to be successful at career fairsAlumnus shares his advice on networking and looking for jobs
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Contributing Editor
With hordes of students 
pushing their way through a 
maze of potential recruiters, 
job fairs can be overwhelm­
ing. The Employment Oppor­
tunities Conference (EOC) 
has 137 registered companies 
and is spread out across two 
rooms — Wiegand Gym and 
Rangos Hall.
In order to make this seem­
ingly daunting task of navi­
gating through the job fair 
while simultaneously making 
a good impression on the re­
cruiters seem easier, the Car­
negie Mellon Career Center 
presented a seminar on how 
to be successful at a job fair.
Presented by Sonjala Wil­
liams, assistant director at the 
Carnegie Mellon Career Cen­
ter, the seminar provided tips 
on what students should do to 
prepare for the job fair, how 
they should approach recruit­
ers during the fair, and what 
steps they should take after 
the fair is over.
Preparing for the job fair
“Preparation is key to suc­
cess,” Williams said. She add­
ed that the firsj: priority of the 
students should be to develop 
a “clean, concise, error-free 
r£sum£.”
Students can also seek 
help from the career center 
regarding their resumes and 
have their resumes approved 
by a Career Center adviser. It 
is also important to carry mul­
tiple copies of their resume to 
the job fair.
The next important point 
that Williams mentioned is to 
research the companies that 
you want to approach at the 
job fair. As Williams said, the 
students should have “enough 
information [about the com­
panies] to have an intelligent 
conversation” with recruiters.
Another useful tip is to write 
down a few questions about 
the company to ask the repre­
sentatives.
Williams also added that 
students should rank the com­
panies according to their pref­
erences. She compared the 
ranking process to the ranking 
process while applying to uni­
versities. “Like college,” Wil­
liams said, “[you should have 
your] top priorities and safe­
ties.” A student should know 
what each specific company is 
looking for and why they are 
the right fit for the company.
Students should also know 
how to project themselves to 
the recruiters and make sure 
that the recruiters realize the 
value of the student.
As Williams said, you 
should know how to “sell 
yourself.”
Williams recommended 
that the students prepare a 
“30-to-60 second commer­
cial” about themselves. This 
statement should include 
what type of internships the 
student is looking for and why 
they are a good candidate.
Lastly, it is important to 
dress properly for the fair. Wil­
liams said that a general rule 
of thumb during interviews 
was to “dress two notches 
above what the interviewers 
would wear.”
For the EOC, the safest 
dress code would be business 
professional.
The career center has a 
closet full of clean, donated 
business suits that students 
who do not have suits can 
use.
Williams also cautioned 
students not to “overdo it” 
while dressing for the fair. 
Excessive makeup or perfume 
could turn the recruiters away 
rather than impress them.
What to do at the job fair
Although many students
might be coming to the job 
fair after or before classes, 
they should avoid carrying 
coats or bags into the fair.
Coats and bags not only 
weigh one down while walk­
ing through two levels of 
booths, but are also awkward 
to handle while talking to re­
cruiters.
A simple folder with mul­
tiple resumes and a pen is all 
one should carry. Williams 
added that before entering 
the fair, it is important to look 
at a copy of the map of the 
booth setup and know which 
booths to approach first.
Using the first half-hour or 
so to take a quick look around 
the fair is also a good idea.
After getting a general feel 
for the fair, one should start 
approaching the top compa­
nies.
When approaching a 
booth, never go in a group. 
Students have to show re­
cruiters that they are unique, 
and going together in a group 
defies this purpose.
While talking to recruiters, 
Williams advised students to 
“be conversational and confi­
dent.”
Non-verbal cues are as im­
portant as verbal ones. “Make 
sure you’re exhibiting good 
body language,” Williams 
added.
A useful tip that Williams 
gave was to write something 
specific about your conversa­
tion with the recruiter on the 
back of your resume before 
handing it to them. This will 
help the recruiters identify 
your resume from among the 
tons of resumes that they re­
ceive.
Williams also added that 
students should never be ar­
rogant while talking to the 
companies.
The worst attitude to have 
is that “I’m great, they should

Success stories: How to make an impression on recruiter^
SABRINA PORTER
Contributing Editor
Job fairs have been the be­
ginning of great careers for 
many Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents. In this article, students 
share tips on how to use job 
fairs to your advantage and 
get that dream job.
Kyla Dolan, a sophomore 
computer science major, got 
her summer internship from 
the 2009 Technical Opportu­
nities Conference (TOC).
“When talking to my advis­
er about summer internships, 
he recommended that I apply 
for the Google Bold Practicum 
program. So I went to their 
table at the TOC,” she said.
Dolan said that this interac­
tion was the first step in a pro­
cess that involved two techni­
cal phone interviews before
she was offered a position in 
the program. Dolan said her 
resume was one of the most 
important parts of the process 
that allowed her to stand out.
“Don’t underestimate the 
importance of your resume. 
It’s what the employers will 
bring with them from the job 
fair that’s all about you,” she 
said.
Shane Rife, a junior civil 
engineering major, secured a 
position working with the fed­
eral government through the 
2008 TOC. Last summer, Rife 
was a civil engineering intern 
at Aberdeen Testing Center 
(ATC), a Department of De­
fense automotive and direct 
fire testing center in eastern 
Maryland.
This position allowed him 
to see how much he wanted 
to work with the government.
The EOC job fair is this Thursday, so we asked,
What is your dream job and why?
While at the TOC, however, 
Rife kept his options open.
“I talked to the compa­
nies that seemed interesting, 
regardless of whether they 
were a typical civil engineer­
ing company. I was one of the 
only civil engineering interns 
at ATC,” he said.
Rife said that the process of 
getting a government intern­
ship and obtaining the neces­
sary security clearance was 
grueling, but that it was well 
worth it since he is now pre­
pared to look for other govern­
ment jobs.
“Be yourself, not the per­
son you think they are looking 
for,” he said.
For Lauren Taglieri, a senior 
information systems major, the 
TOC and Business Opportuni­
ties Conference have been the 
start to both her most recent
summer internship and post­
graduation job, respectively. 
Last summer, she worked with 
the Society of Research Ad­
ministrators in information 
technology, and this summer, 
she will begin her job at Delo- 
itte in Washington, D.C.
“I tried to ask as many 
questions about the company 
as I could in the few minutes I 
had at the booth, and then just 
got all the handouts they had,” 
she said.
Taglieri then went home to 
review her information and to 
research the companies online 
before looking for interviews 
and information sessions on 
TartanTrak.
“Generally I think it’s good 
to know what companies will 
be at the fair and do some 
background research before 
it starts. That way you can
target the companies you are 
interested in and not be over­
whelmed,” she said.
“Having a good, organized 
resume and being excited 
about learning about the com­
pany helps too.”
Rachel Cawley, a Decem­
ber 2009 graduate of the mas­
ter’s in information systems 
management program at the 
Heinz School and a May 2009 
graduate from the electrical 
and computer engineering de­
partment, got her dream job 
from an encounter that began 
at last fall’s TOC.
Cawley will soon begin 
work with Raytheon, a com­
pany specializing in defense 
technology and training, 
homeland and border security, 
and cybersecurity at its office 
in Boston.
Cawley made a list of com­
panies ’ she wanted to talk ) 
tefore the fair, then wento 
each one, introducing lerslf 
and asking about the op>orJ- 
nities available. At each can ^ 
pany, Cawley asked for abii- 
ness card and about theneit 
steps necessary.
“The next day, I woud a* 
ways e-mail them to reninl 
them of what we talked doit 
and thank them for their tne} 
Cawley said.
Cawley estimated thit a} 
most 90 percent of her iifcrn 
ships, jobs, and intevfew? 
have originated with ejcain 
ters at the TOC.
“My suggestion is t> saf; 
with a company that yci dm’: 
care about as much asa pac- 
tice. That way you ca warm 
up, and you might eveiendup 
liking that company ayway,” 
Cawley said.

How to handle interviews: A general guide to dos and don'ts during interviews
Anabelle Lee/Copy Staff
Interviews usually make or break job offers. There are a couple of factors, which when kept in mind, help make interviews highly successful.
JACKSON LANE
Staffwriter
Even if your r6sum£ is a me­
ticulously crafted piece of art 
detailing an unbroken chain of 
accomplishments, most poten­
tial employers ultimately rely 
on interviews to confirm that 
you are as impressive as the 
resume states.
“The purpose of the resu­
me is to get the interview. The
purpose of the interview is to 
get the job,” said Lisa Dickter, 
associate director in the Ca­
reer Center.
After the Employment Op­
portunities Conference on 
Thursday, many students will 
be invited to interviews with 
potential employers.
Here is some advice on 
what to do and what not to do 
during these interviews and 
how to make the interviews
turn out for the best.
Make good first and last im­
pressions
This is true for almost any 
social interaction or relation­
ship.
“The beginning and end­
ing of an interview is when a 
recruiter decides whether or 
not they think personally the 
student is [a] good fit for the 
company.... [The recruiters
decide whether the student 
is] a pleasant person to be in 
that particular culture,” said 
Claudia Kirkpatrick, associate 
teaching professor at the Tep- 
per School of Business.
Compared to the other 
parts of an interview, making 
good first and last impressions 
is relatively easy.
A big smile, a firm hand­
shake, and good posture are 
usually enough.
Match the tone
In almost any social inter­
action, how one speaks is at 
least as important as What 
one says. Interviews can be 
tricky, though, because they 
can range from highly formal 
and structured to very casual 
and relaxed, depending on the 
company and position.
“Assume it’s formal, but 
then take the lead from the 
interviewer,” Dickter advised. 
“But no matter how informal 
the recruiter, keep a level of 
professionalism. You don’t 
ever want to feel that they are 
your buddy.” Kirkpatrick also 
added, “If the recruiter asks 
the student why they are inter­
ested in a certain company, and 
the recruiter is being very for­
mal and very stiff, the student 
would want to be very explicit 
about the job requirements as 
they were posted.... However, 
if the recruiter is very relaxed 
... then the student has the op­
portunity to be more creative, 
but also remembering at the 
same time to talk about things 
relevant to the company.”
Stay positive
It is important to maintain a 
positive outlook during the in­
terview. Never speak negative­
ly about anything during the 
interview. You cannot throw 
mud without first getting 
your own hands dirty, and in 
this job market, you probably 
can’t afford to be anything but 
spotless. “[Employers] don’t 
want to hear outrage. They 
don’t want to hear anger and 
that you couldn’t deal with it,” 
Dickter said. “An employer will 
start to think the student is a 
negative person that will be 
critical of other people when 
they are actually on the job.”
Know yourself
The employer probably al­
ready read your resume, but 
the employer will also expect
you to be able to articulate 
why you feel your accomplish­
ments are noteworthy.
“[Students] need to know 
their strengths and their skills, 
and they need to be able to 
confidently explain each of 
their experiences in an orga­
nized way,” Dickter said.
“Students need to weave 
into their answers to the em­
ployers’ questions ... their 
strengths and skills.” Kirkpat­
rick emphasized that students 
should be aware of how their 
accomplishments were useful 
and added value. “A resume 
will state what the student 
did, but the interviewer will 
want to know more about 
what difference that made and 
what results are still there,” 
she said.
Know the company
“At the very least you need 
to know what they do, what 
they make, who their clients 
are, and why they exist,” 
Dickter said. It really is just 
common courtesy, since the 
employer probably also took 
the time to read your resum£. 
Dickter advised that a short 
visit to the company’s website 
should be sufficient.
Be enthusiastic about the job
Don’t just pretend to show 
enthusiasm. Actually be en­
thusiastic, because it is a rare 
and exclusive honor that you 
are even being considered for 
a position at all.
As Kirkpatrick advised, 
“One of the things that any 
student going [through] the 
interview process should re­
member is that if they take 
the job, he or she will do it 
passionately.” She also added 
that it is important not to have 
pre-conceived notions about 
any job. “A student should not 
pre-judge whether or not he or 
she will take the job until the 
company offers it,” Kirkpatrick 
said.
Career Center seminar gives tips on handling job fairs with ease
FAIR, from B2
want me, I’m CMU.” Humility 
and politeness matter as much 
as having excellent creden­
tials. Williams asked the stu­
dents to not simply go around 
and collect all the freebies. 
This not only bogs down the 
students, but also creates a 
negative impression of them. 
Lastly, Williams advised stu­
dents to collect as many busi­
ness cards as they can. These 
will be useful in contacting 
the recruiters in the future.
What to do after the fair is 
over <
Sadly, the work does not
stop once the fair is over; it 
only increases. Williams reit­
erated the importance of fol­
lowing up with companies. 
Sending thank-you notes to 
all the companies you talked 
to is a must. Williams added 
that the notes should be sent
24 to 48 hours after the job 
fair and could be e-mails or 
even paper letters.
She explained the impor­
tance of taking notes during 
the fair so that the students 
can write something specific 
about the conversation they 
had with the recruiters in the 
letter.
Following up with the 
companies to make sure that 
they know you are interested
in the position is crucial. Wil­
liams stressed that students 
should not be shy while trying 
to contact the companies.
Williams said that “you 
have the right to follow up” 
and ask the companies wheth­
er the position is still open. It 
is also great to follow up by 
sending the company resume 
updates or additions to one’s 
portfolio.
Williams concluded the 
seminar by telling the stu­
dents that at the job fair, 
they are all ambassadors of 
Carnegie Mellon University. 
“If [the recruiters] come and 
have a great experience here, 
they will want to come back 
again,” Williams said.
CARNEGIE SCIENCE CENTER
One of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh
2004 alumnus shares his journey from college to a successful career
Laser Shows
AT CARNEGIE SCIENCE CENTER
ALUM, from B2
its U.S. headquarters here in 
Pittsburgh, is one such story 
of success after graduation 
from Carnegie Mellon.
While lams was working at 
Bayer, he was also taking night 
classes at the Heinz School, 
studying public policy and 
management, which resulted 
in his attaining his master’s 
degree in public management 
in 2004.
Though he is currently an 
employee of Bayer, lams’ first 
job was with the global pub­
lic relations agency Burson- 
Marsteller, also in Pittsburgh. 
While there, he worked as 
part of the firm’s public rela­
tions practice.
lams explained that he 
“provided media relations 
support and counsel to a 
wide range of consumer and 
business-to-business clients” 
while working at Burson- 
Marsteller.
After leaving the firm, 
lams went to Bayer to gain 
experience in a different side 
of the public relations field. 
At Bayer, lams is responsible
for serving as the company 
spokesperson and managing 
corporate media relations, 
public affairs, advertising, 
and online media.
“I left Burson and joined 
Bayer to gain experience on 
the corporate side of the com­
munications and public affairs 
business,” lams said.
lams also attributes his time 
spent in the Heinz program to 
aiding him in his career’s suc­
cess. “I was impressed with 
the caliber of professors at the 
Heinz School. They brought a 
real-world insight to the class­
room, which provided the 
students with a hands-on look 
at many of the challenges and 
opportunities that we would 
face upon graduation,” he 
said.
Moreover, lams believes 
that it was the other students 
of the master’s program that 
helped him to benefit further.
“The Heinz School’s di­
versity — people and think­
ing — made the experience 
extremely valuable.” lams 
also valued the experience of 
being able to meet a wide va­
riety of people from different
backgrounds. “In many cases, 
my classmates were from all 
parts of the world, and this 
provided a true global per­
spective to the graduate pro­
gram,” lams stated.
lams believes that other 
students looking for an intern­
ship or job can be just as suc­
cessful as he was. He advises 
students to focus their job 
search on areas that they are 
specifically interested in, and 
that students try to keep long­
term career goals in mind in 
addition to short-term ones.
“My advice is simple. Don’t 
settle for just any internship 
or job as possible. Look and 
then apply for internships or 
jobs that will provide growth 
in your particular field of in­
terest.” lams also stressed 
the importance of thinking 
toward the future and focus­
ing on long-term goals rather 
than short-term goals.
“Be patient with your ca­
reer and take a longer-term 
approach to your goals. If you 
focus on doing great work in 
your field, everything else will 
take care of itself over time,” 
lams said. A

Opera combines love and suicide Everything you need to know
A classic Japanese tale meets modern influences in The Mikado About breakup paranoia and partial exclusivity.
Ancient Japan and modern-day British private 
school life shared the stage this past weekend in 
the Carnegie Mellon University School of Music’s 
rendition of The Mikado. A Gilbert and Sullivan 
piece, this classic is a comedic love story, originally 
a parody of the ridiculous rules and customs of 
Victorian England as shown through the guise of 
Japan. Directed by Gregory Lehane, designed by 
new head of the drama department Peter Cooke, 
and with the orchestra directed by Bob Page, The 
Mikado has been plucked out of feudal Japan and 
placed in the more modern-day setting of a British 
private school. Played by a dual cast, this new 
adaptation comes with many alterations and twists 
that allow audiences to relate the story to life in 
today’s world as well as to its Victorian origins.
As the overture begins, the stage is lit with dozens 
of paper lanterns hanging above the setting of a 
gymnasium, where students in uniform gather and 
mill about, socializing and leaning against lockers, 
portraying the typical social landscape of middle 
schools worldwide.
Soon, a lone trombonist enters, amid excited 
gossiping from the girls and derisive looks from 
the boys, and reveals himself to be the wandering 
musician Nanki-Poo, played by Ian McEuen and 
Ryan Townsend. Nanki-Poo and the schoolgirl 
Yum-Yum, played by juniors Asha Carroll and 
Kristen Hahn, are in love.
However, Yum-Yum is the ward and bride-to-be of 
the official Ko-Ko, played alternately by senior Scott 
Wasserman and senior Adam Hill, who has risen in 
worldly status to become the Lord High Executioner 
of the town Titipu, where the characters live. To 
assure everyone of the importance of his position, 
Ko-Ko informs the audience of all the people who 
“will not be missed” in the extremely entertaining 
and rather vindictive song “I’ve Got a Little List.” 
The updated version of this song has the audience 
in stitches over Ko-Ko's choice of victims, such as 
“children who have cell phones and who text with 
them all day.” Ko-Ko was animated and hilarious, 
and his scenes with the many personas of Lord 
Pooh-Bah are equally entertaining.
The haughty lord Pooh-Bah, played by senior Hans 
Tashjian, who is able to trace his noble lineage 
back to a single-celled organism, arrives in Titipu 
and assumes the role of every important official 
available. Yum-Yum and her two friends tease the 
lord about his snooty manners in the comically 
mocking song “So Please You, Sir,” while Ko-Ko frets 
over his duty of beheading someone as the Lord 
High Executioner.
Nanki-Poo manages to have a moment alone with
Yum-Yum, where he reveals his true identity as the 
son of the Mikado, the Emperor of Japan, played by 
senior Tim Ruff. He is forced to flee his position at 
the court after attracting the unwelcome attention 
of the noblewoman Katisha, played by seniors 
Melissa Johnson and Alexa Devlin.
When a flustered Ko-Ko threatens to end their love, 
Nanki-Poo decides he would rather end his own life 
than live without his love. However, Nanki-Poo’s 
imminent suicide inspires Ko-Ko to strike a deal 
with the young prince: If Nanki-Poo is allowed to 
marry Yum-Yum and live in happiness for a month, 
Ko-Ko will then be allowed to fulfill his official duty 
and cut off his head. Nanki-Poo readily agrees to 
this, but thanks to the skittishness of Ko-Ko, the 
interference of Poo-Bah, and the untimely arrival of 
Katisha and the Mikado himself, things turn out as 
planned.
Mixing paper lanterns with plaid skirts, and flowing 
kimonos with a giant portrait of Her Majesty Queen 
Victoria, The Mikado was a hilarious and engaging 
work that entertained new audiences and provided 
a modern twist for those familiar with this classic 
show, showcasing the talent and ingenuity of the 
students and their teachers. Her Majesty would be 
pleased.

Dear Hoskins Brothers, Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I just started dating this 
guy and t really like him, 
but I can’t help obsessing 
over the fact that he could 
break up with me at any 
moment How do I get 
myself to start enjoying 
this relationship and stop 
fretting about the future?
—Forever afraid of rejection
Dear FEAR,
Take a moment to stop and 
ask yourself: Why do you feel 
this way? Has your boyfriend 
given you any reason to 
make you feel insecure? Is 
he flaky? Noncommittal? 
Uninterested? If the answer 
to these questions is yes, 
then you’re talking to the 
wrong person. You need to 
talk to your boyfriend. If he 
cares about you, he’ll do 
what he can to reassure you 
and show that he cares.
If you have no reason to 
feel this way, then you need 
to recognize that this is just 
paranoia. If you ever feel 
yourself getting worked up 
about it, stop and take a 
deep breath. Really take 
in your surroundings. Feel 
the air in your lungs, your 
boyfriend next to you, the fun 
you’re having with him. Take 
that moment and revel in it. 
You’re in a relationship and 
you’re both happy.*You have 
no reason to fret.
Live in the moment,
—Patrick Hoskins
I’ve been seeing this guy 
who refuses to commit 
to me. He says he knows 
what he wants, but he 
avoids the subject of 
exclusivity. Is it wrong 
for me to feel annoyed? 
Should he be willing to 
commit?
—Sick of only liking one 
Dear SOLO,
He may know what he wants, 
but the real question is: what 
do you want? It sounds to me 
like you want to be exclusive 
with him, meaning you need 
to sit down and hash this out. 
If he doesn't want to commit, 
then you have two options: 
stick around and put up with 
him, or head for greener 
pastures. You can’t force him 
to be exclusive or to be in a 
relationship with you — his 
feelings are his own, and as 
valid as yours, and you have 
no right to change him. But 
if he wants to be with you, 
let him know that you need 
some measure of exclusivity. 
If this guy is the right fit for 
you, he’ll want to be with you. 
Think of your relationship as 
a glove: You can’t force your 
way into a glove that isn’t 
right for you. it’s no reason 
to be mad at the glove; that’s 
just how it is. Of course, if the 
glove keeps sliding off, that’s 
reason enough to be angry. 
Just remember: If the glove 
don’t fit, you can’t commit.
Talk it out,
—Brian Hoskins

Tales from abroad: Europe
A student’s guide to traveling Europe the safe, cheap, and satisfactory way.
Traveling in a foreign country is always a challenge, 
especially while studying abroad. Get some quick tips 
from this informal travel guide put together by two 
students who studied abroad at Imperial College London 
and had the opportunity to travel across Europe during 
their time there.
The informal guide to traveling abroad while 
studying abroad
Okay. You’re a student. You want to see a lot of places. 
You don’t have money. But don’t let that stop you — 
traveling in Europe can be super-cheap and easy. We’ll 
admit that it won't be the most glamorous experience 
("How many times have I worn this shirt? Only five? 
Okay, good to go.’’), but we think it is the best way for 
students to travel.
Step 1: What to pack?
Versatile clothes for any weather (Learn to layer)
Tennis shoes, sandals, or flats (No heels)
Travel guide (a helpful reference; check out your local 
library for a free one)
Toiletries (Shampoo can double as body wash)
Backpack or tote bag (Buy convertible luggage)
Lock(s) (for luggage and locker)
Camera (DSLR is nice, but sometimes a pain to take care 
of, so slip a cheap point-and-shoot in your pocket and try 
not to live out your memories behind the lens)
Journal
Step 2: Planning
Go everywhere you possibly can! Really. Generally, allow 
at least four days in the really big cities. Sometimes you 
can stay for weeks and still feel like you missed things. 
Otherwise two to three days for smaller cities could do 
them plenty of justice.
Also try to plan around local holidays or festivals. This 
m can either be really amazing —
events — or it can suck — you’re surrounded by tourists 
in fanny packs, and everything will get more expensive.
Step 3: Getting there
So there’s this thing called EuroPass that allows you to 
travel all over Europe with just one card. There are some 
stipulations: You can only use it for a certain number of 
days in a short period. It’ll-get you to places fast and it 
gives you freedom to go anywhere.
RyanAir, Aer Lingus, and EasyJet are the most popular 
“value” airlines, meaning super-cheap flights (some of 
ours were free plus $10 to $20 for taxes), but of course 
there are hidden costs. Most of these flights land in 
airports an hour or so away from the city, so prepare to 
arrange and pay for bus transportation. Try Terravision, 
EasyBus, or local bus services. Generally, the airport 
websites will have information to help you. Baggage 
weight and size is heavily restricted, especially with 
RyanAir, so follow the rules and don’t cheat the system. 
Keep in mind that these extra costs can add up, so even 
if your flight is cheap it might be worth the extra money 
to fly directly into the city.
Step 4: Finding a place to stay
Hostels are the way to go when on a budget (which you 
probably are). Save your money for fun stuff. We’re used 
to cramped dorms anyways — hostels are just like them.
Try to book a hostel at least a week in advance. Some 
people like the thrill of finding a hostel once they arrive; 
however, you’re likely to pay a lot more or end up in a 
crap-hole.
Good places to start for 
hostels: Hostelworld. 
com, Hostels.com, and 
Hostelbookers.com, all 
of which give great
recommendations and reviews.
What constitutes a good hostel?
Location: The hostel should be located very near to 
public transportation (if available), or within walking 
distance to the things you want to see.
Free breakfast: The majority of hostels offer free 
breakfast, mostly of the "toast, jam, and cereal” 
type. While this might not seem like much, that free 
sustenance starts a long day of adventuring off on the 
right foot.
Lockers: Hopefully you didn’t pack too many valuables, 
but it’s nice to know that you’ll still have clothes when 
you come back.
Linen: Some super-stingy hostels require you to bring 
your own linen, so beware; others might ask you to rent. 
Usually they’re included.
Generally, hostels range from 11 to 20 euros ($15 to $28) 
a night, depending on the city and the day. You’ll pay 
extra for weekends or for staying in very touristy cities.
Step 5: Explore!
Everyone explores differently, but we’d like to suggest 
some tips:
Wander: Guidebooks are great, but nothing beats the 
feeling of stumbling onto treasure when you least expect 
it. Sure, you’ll get lost, but it is a great way to get to 
know the city.
Food: Look for open markets because they're amazing, 
(La Boqueria in Barcelona, Borough Market in London, 
rue Mouffetard in Paris) and look for dinner specials. 
Don't hesitate to ask your hostel for recommendations. 
The highest point in the city: Find it! You'll get great 
views, even better pictures, and the best memories.

Transference causes listèners déjà vu
Spoon’s third album proves to be repetitive, mimicking sounds and styles from earlier releases
However, it seems as if they could not deviate extremely 
far from Ga, so they tried to make very similar songs 
without the high level of Ga’s production.
"Trouble Comes Running" is another excellent example 
of a usual “Spoon” track, acting as a microcosm of 
Transference. Does it have a repeated lyrical theme?
Yes. A heavy beat? Yes. Spoon’s typical harsh guitar? 
Yes. However, the released version of the song is a demo 
track — meaning it isn't put through the heavy editing 
done in studios. It’s an interesting choice by the band, 
as the track’s haziness distinguishes it from the rest of 
Spoon’s library. While it might sound extremely similar to 
many of their previous songs, its execution is laudable.
Transference’s déjà vu doesn’t necessarily ruin the 
album. While Transference hasn’t been the canonical 
Spoon album (that title would go to either Ga or Gimme 
Fiction), it at least attempts at altering the band’s 
sound. The first half breaks up melodies suddenly and 
alters them, and “Written in Reverse” is certainly one of 
Spoon’s best songs. Overall, Transference is an album 
that contains too many forgettable tracks. Both lyrically 
and musically, Spoon seems to have hit a creative wall. If 
Spoon wants to be more than simply the darling of their 
hometown — Austin, Texas — they must branch out 
and experiment more with their music.
Christopher Jarrett j Staffwriter
Since Spoon’s breakthrough album, 2007’s Ga Ga Ga Ga 
Ga, audiences have been eagerly awaiting the band’s 
follow-up. But Spoon’s latest record, Transference, 
disappoints, consisting of the same popped drums and 
jutting melodies as all of their records.
While some criticized Radiohead’s In Rainbows as 
Radiohead “attempting” to make a Radiohead album, 
Spoon has decided to one-up the band by making their 
newest album nearly the same as the past two, Ga and 
Gimme Fiction. Perhaps Spoon saw the massive success 
of In Rainbows and thought that they could emulate that 
success — or, more likely, Spoon has hit a creative block - 
that they need to overcome to remain relevant. All of the 
tracks contain the signature Spoon sound.
The middle portion of the album, tracks five through 
nine, contains the meat of Transference. “Written in 
Reverse," the most notable track on the album, consists 
of several breaks from the beat that give a disorienting 
experience. The piano’s forcefulness nearly equals the 
steady drums. While lead singer Britt Daniel is constantly 
rasping his voice over the top of the music, his lyrics are 
easily forgettable, especially the horrendous “Writing this 
to you in reverse/Someone better call a hearse.” Despite 
its shortcomings, “Written in Reverse” will join “Beast 
and Dragon, Adored" as the two best heavy jams that 
Spoon has created.
After “Written in Reverse" comes “I Saw the Light.” The

buildup of the track is quite excellent, with Daniel’s 
voice mixing with the music quite nicely. Daniel oozes 
suaveness as he nonchalantly sings his portion until the 
guitars build to their forte. Then, suddenly, at the peak 
of the track, it turns into an instrumental. While it isn’t 
terrible, the instrumental section seems as if it were a 
placeholder for something to be finished later. Much 
like the entirety of Transference, “I Saw the Light” does 
not feel finished. Perhaps this rawness is supposed to 
bring the audience closer to Spoon’s creative process.

La Feria puts an American spin on Peruvian cuisine
From exotic empanadas to typical turkey sandwiches, this Shadyside restaurant has it all
When one goes off campus for a meal, one expects a 
great evening out with good food. However, going out 
for a meal is not just about food, it is also about having 
a memorable experience. Shadyside is just a short 
walks away from campus and has plenty of delicious 
restaurants to try. La Feria is located right above 
Pamela’s Diner, and it provides a great opportunity for a 
new culinary journey.
La Feria is a Peruvian restaurant co-owned by Pamela 
Cohen, owner of Pittsburgh’s favorite American diner 
Pamela’s, and Luis Perras, a Peruvian native. Because 
of this, La Feria serves up an American take on the 
Peruvian kitchen. I have nothing against Americanized 
food, as long as it is done with an understanding of 
native food and American cuisine. After all, it is only 
natural that foreign cuisine is subject to'a lack of the 
same resources. Such constraints provide a great stage 
for interpretation, as accomplished by well known Mario 
Batali’s Americanized Italian cuisine or the well-known 
David Handler’s Americanized Crepe Parisiennes.
Aside from the regular salad and sandwiches, La Feria 
serves Peruvian foods like empanadas, a dumpling 
made from pastry dough and various fillings. Not only 
is La Feria a restaurant, but it also doubles as a self- 
proclaimed Peruvian craft gallery. The ambience is quite 
unusual. One feels like a tourist dining in a souvenir 
shop.
The Piqueo meal for two is fairly proced. It includes a
set of two specials, two empanadas, sweet potato chips, 
rice, French bread, and a salad. The Pepian De Choclo, 
described by a waiter as a rice soufflé with corn, sweet 
pepper and Pastel De Papas, reminds one of an English 
sheperd’s pie with minced beef.
The sweet potato chips were nicely done: very thinly 
and evenly sliced, fried just until crisp and not oily. They 
were served with a type of cottage cheese, an intelligent 
counterpart for the unusual chips. The mild tang to the 
crisp sweet potato chips was enjoyable. Many places 
would have over-fried and burned the extra sugar in the 
potatoes. Unlike most potato dishes, these chips were 
not filling, but instead added a hint of sweetness to the 
meal — as if fried in shallot oil.
The empanadas were stuffed with minced chorizo, 
traditionally referred to as dried sausage and commonly 
used in Spanish cuisine with minced beef and raisins. 
The warm choiizo that fills the empanadas reminds one 
of Indian influences, while the minced beef and raisins 
were something like a traditional English mincemeat pie
The Pepian De Choclo was presented with a rice soufflé 
served next to white rice and a generous cold green 
salad with standard oil and vinegar dressing. This salad, 
topped with freshly grated cheese, walnuts, and black 
olives, was refreshing.
The rice soufflé was lukewarm and unsatisfying, draped 
over salted mashed rice with corn and pepper strings.
Generally, soufflé is an airy, whipped, egg white-based 
French dish baked in an oven and is usually served as 
a dessert. I have no objection to creative dishes, but 
describing mashed rice as a soufflé was misleading. The 
Pastel De Papas was nothing memorable. If these dishes 
were really the specials, one would hope the daily menu 
could prove much stronger.
The history of La Feria can be traced back to 1993, but, 
despite its history and good reputation, the tables at La 
Feria last Friday night were surprisingly empty. It was 
also interesting to note that two drastically different 
meals, La Feria’s and Pamela’s, were coming out of the 
same kitchen.
Nonetheless, it can be imagined that a meal like this 
might be served in a little tourist trap in a popular tourist 
area somewhere in Peru; westernized native food for 
foreign travelers.

Maps and graphs: Making art of our solar system
Last week’s Miller Gallery workshop inspires participants to consider the curious stars
“You aren’t going to have a factory built out of dark 
matter. You aren’t going to have test pilots who are . 
invisible.”
You aren't. The factories will be built out of concrete 
and rebar, the test pilots as visible as your uncle. Even 
factories and pilots that serve classified aircrafts, the 
factories that don’t exist, the pilots that spend their days 
flying planes that never were. This is the world that 
Trevor Paglen explores. He is trying to circumnavigate 
this "black world,” a space that exists inside restricted 
military areas, a space that is observable only through 
the way it interacts with our own world, our normal, 
everyday, not-at-all confidential experience.
Paglen spoke as part of Experimental Cartographies, a 
multi-day workshop co-hosted by the Studio for Creative 
Inquiry and the Miller Gallery last week. He was part 
of a series of speakers who explained their work and 
art, which focused on re-framing popular conceptions 
of map-making. Paglen himself focused on these 
explorations of the secret: holes in government budgets,
aircrafts that don’t exist, airline companies that are 
stand-ins for the CIA. And while his work is politically 
motivated by the climate of terrorism, the methodology 
is hundreds of years old.
"Minding the heavens" was a description used by 
Caroline Herschel, the famous German astronomer, 
to describe the activity she and her brother would 
perform each night. They memorized the star charts, 
internalizing the positions of every known object in the 
sky. They were not processing images by computer, 
they were not comparing photographic slides; they were 
searching the heavens for stars that didn’t belong.
Richard Holmes’ account of the Herschels takes 
center stage in his newest book, Age of Wonder:
How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty 
and Terror of Science. They are the archetypes of 
romantic scientists, thinkers whose years of education 
and work led the public to the idealized portrait of a 
scientist under a tree deducing gravity. But it was their 
meticulous years spent recording out-of-place “stars”
that led to the discovery of dozens of comets, hundreds 
of galaxies, and Georgium Sidus, the planet that we 
would come to know as Uranus. The discoveries not only 
expanded the size of our solar system, but they led to a 
re-imagining of the size of the entire universe.
Through Experimental Cartographies, we see maps 
continue to play a crucial role in our understanding of 
space. But the maps themselves are evolving. We aren’t 
crossing the oceans from port to port, we are tracking 
off-the-record flights in and out of Guantanamo Bay, 
finding a new apartment on Google Street View, and 
seeing galaxies discovered in the 1780s in exquisite 
technicolor from the Hubble telescope. However, the 
message from many of the speakers was one of tempered 
optimism and cautious conspiracy-theorism: With the 
maps becoming more technical and information-rich, as 
consumers we must be mindful of the edges, the details 
left off, the hidden black worlds.

Pirate Radio is a film depicting the 
rockin’ good times to be had while 
broadcasting a radio station from a 
pirate ship. In the movie, we follow 
a rogue radio station broadcasting 
music from the Atlantic Ocean to 
the people of Great Britain after the 
government banned rock and roll in 
1967. Philip Seymour Hoffman stars 
as the head DJ who tries his best to 
avoid several government attempts 
to shut his station down. While not 
based on any true story, the movie 
boasts a solid ensemble cast and 
has many funny moments, along with 
great music from several of the most 
popular bands of the 1960s.

Where the Wild Things Are
Friday, Feb. 5

Where the Wild Things Are is a 
fantastic voyage through the mind 
of a child, Max, where he creates a 
whole new world, one filled with wild 
creatures roaming the land. The film 
stars then-10-year-old Max Records 
in just his third role, along with many 
respected actors who provided the 
voices for the Wild Things. Director 
Spike Jonze is at his absolute creative 
best in this extremely well put-together 
adaptation of the popular children’s 
book, one that still appeals to all ages. 
Fun fact: The actors and stunt men 
actually walked around in the giant 
monster suits to give the monsters as 
realistic a feel as possible.
Robin Hood: Men in Tights
Saturday, Feb. 6 
8 10 12
Mel Brooks does a fantastic job with this 
hilarious spoof on the legend of Robin 
Hood. The film stars an ensemble cast, 
including Dave Chappelle in his acting 
debut, that keeps you laughing from 
start to finish. In Men in Tights, we first 
meet Robin Hood after he is imprisoned 
during the Crusades. Soon, though, 
he escapes and begins rounding up a 
band of very merry men as he tries to 
exact revenge on the abusive Prince 
John. The comedic styling of Brooks 
is more apparent than ever as the 
movie contains hundreds of innuendos, 
references to past Brooks movies, and, 
of course, a cameo by the man himself. 
See it and be happy for a while.
Paranormal Activity
Sunday, Feb. 7

Paranormal Activity is a thriller in the 
mold of The Blair Witch Project, but 
packs a hauntingly unique punch 
of its own. When a young woman 
claims a ghostly presence has 
haunted her for years, her boyfriend 
naturally decides to set up a camera 
in their new home to find out what, 
if anything, is haunting them. What 
follows is a truly terrifying experience. 
Made on just a $15,000 budget, 
Paranormal Activity has grossed over 
$140 million at the box office, making 
it one of the most profitable movies 
ever. Fun fact: The director, Oren 
Peli, has admitted to being afraid of 
ghosts his entire life, including the 
movie Ghostbusters.

Third time’s the charm for Bhangra in the Burgh
Annual campus event brings Carnegie Mellon students together to celebrate culture and dance
by Akanksha Vaidya | Contributing Editor J 
| by Priyamvada Gupta | Staffwriter J
Bhangra. Over the past three years, this word has 
created a special place for itself in the Carnegie Mellon 
lingo. To an outsider, bhangra — one of the most popular 
Indian dances — would entail brilliant colors, energy- 
packed performances, and wholesome entertainment.
To the average Carnegie Mellon student, bhangra has 
come to mean all this and much more. Bhangra in the 
Burgh, Carnegie Mellon University’s annual bhangra 
competition, is the largest student-run event on campus 
and has transformed from just being a celebration of 
dance to a gathering of vibrant student life, an event that 
has the entire campus community tapping to its beats.
Considering the fact that the show was sold out, it 
seems clear that Bhangra in the Burgh has retained its 
popularity over the years. Like the previous two years’ 
competitions, Bhangra in the Burgh 3, held at Soldiers & 
Sailors Memorial Hall last Saturday, was* enjoyable until 
the very end. As always, the organizational skill involved 
was phenomenal. The co-chairs for the event this 
year were Gurmukh Singh Chhabra, a junior chemical 
engineering major; Vishal Agrawal, a sophomore
.electrical and computer engineering major; and Suraj 
Baxi, a sophomore social and decision sciences major. 
The event was planned to be bigger and better than 
those of the previous years. Chhabra explained that the 
university’s Pittsburgh chapter alumni meeting was 
happening the same weekend, "so we have 75 alumni 
coming and watching the show.” Chhabra said that 
this would be a great platform to promote the show and 
"showcase [to the alumni] what CMU has to offer and 
what bhangra really is.”
According to Agrawal, handling the entire event was 
both "an honor and responsibility.” The event was all the 
more honorable as all the proceeds from the event were 
donated to the Children’s Home of Pittsburgh. The fact 
that it is a charitable event makes Bhangra in the Burgh 
stand out. “There are a lot of Bhangra competitions all 
over the nation that are done by professional companies, 
and all the profits are kept by them,” Chhabra said.
“[We wanted to] give back to the community and carry 
forward the goal of the 2007 co-chairs and put Pittsburgh 
on the map.”
By drawing in teams from all over the nation, the 
competition has certainly made Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon well known names in the realm of bhangra.
This year, the competition boasted eight competing
bhangra teams: Rutgers Bhangra, Cornell Bhangra,
Drexel University Bhangra, UVA di Shaan, George 
Mason University Bhangra, Michigan Bhangra team, DC 
Bhangra Crew, and VCU Bhangra.
To appeal to a wider portion of the campus population, a 
number of exhibition acts were included in the program. 
These acts consisted of performances by Carnegie 
Mellon groups including the dance troupes Tanah, Chak 
De, and SoulStylz, as well as a cappella groups Deewane 
and the Originals. Other exhibition acts included dance 
performances by the University of Pittsburgh’s Indian 
dance troupe, Pitt Raas, as well as Point Park University’s 
hip-hop group, Impulse.
To add to the entertainment quotient, stand-up 
comedians Rajiv Satyal and Monrok were invited as 
the MCs for the evening. From performing a hilarious 
rendition of one of Bollywood’s most famous dances to 
cracking witty jokes on the Indian community, the MCs 
ensured that the event was enjoyable for all.
The dances themselves were quite remarkable. Although 
each of the competing teams retained the basic flavors 
of the power-packed bhangra style, there was always at 
least one aspect of each performance that was unique to 
each team. Notable among these were the performances

---------------------------------------------------

of DC Bhangra Crew, an all-women team that had a 
rather different, yet pleasing, style of choreography, and 
Cornell Bhangra, which spelled out the name of their 
university during the dance through the body postures 
of the dancers. George Mason University Bhangra and 
UVA di Shaan both made excellent use of dholaks, 
instruments similar to drums that add to the beats of the 
music. Their innovative techniques of experimenting 
with the music, and also their energetic performances, 
earned George Mason University Bhangra and UVA di 
Shaan the third and second prizes, respectively. The first 
prize went to returning champions VCU Bhangra, who, 
along with dancing flawlessly to the music, incorporated 
some Punjabi lines of speech into their act, adding to the 
rustic feeling of the performance.
The exhibition acts were also quite entertaining. One 
of the most enjoyable performances was by SoulStylz. 
The group integrated a number of different dance styles 
in their performance, including hip-hop and typical 
Bollywood dance. By choosing popular songs from Indian 
movies to dance to, SoulStylz had a large portion of the 
audience singing along. The University of Pittsburgh’s 
team performed traditional raas from the western part 
of India, as opposed to bhangra, which is a dance of the 
north. This different dance style helped showcase some 
of the variety that Indian culture has to offer. The event . 
concluded with a performance by Carnegie Mellon's 
very own bhangra team, Chak De. Chak De's fast-paced 
dance and the overwhelming support and cheering 
they received from the audience created an excellent 
performance.
Although there were some minor technical problems
Celia Ludwinski | Photo Editor
with the sound system, the overall event was a great 
success. Compared to last year, there were very few 
issues with the seating in the hall. Agrawal said that 
this was a conscious effort, as the staff took extra care 
to ensure that it did not repeat the mistakes it had 
made before. However, the planning of the event was 
not without some major setbacks. One of the major 
issues the committee faced was that of sponsorship. 
“Most of our external sponsors backed out,” Chhabra 
said. However, despite this, the show managed to run 
smoothly.
For the co-chairs though, success would be determined 
by the satisfaction of the overwhelmingly large Bhangra 
in the Burgh staff. “I think the entire event would be a 
failure if the people who worked the event didn’t have a 
great time," Baxi said.
In fact, as a tribute to the staff, the co-chairs put together 
a video of some of the special moments shared by the 
staff while preparing for the event and showcased it at 
the end of the program.
Baxi said spending time with the staff was one of the 
most enjoyable parts of coordinating the event. “[It was 
jjreat] spending time with the committee and getting 
to know people who you would never know otherwise.” 
Agrawal agreed and said, “[The show is] a good way to 
network and to get to know the campus community.”
For a show that has used Indian culture to bring together 
a variety of people from all parts of the university, 
Bhangra in the Burgh has truly captured the spirit of a 
diverse community like Carnegie Mellon.

One of the most devastating events of history will 
be recorded as the earthquake that took place on 
Jan. 12 in Haiti, reaching a magnitude of 7.0 on 
the Richter scale. The triple earthquake collapsed 
buildings, crumbled the walls of a prison — allowing 
almost all of the 4000 prisoners to escape — and 
claimed the lives of thousands.
Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the western 
hemisphere, prompting great amounts of support 
from the rest of the world. People around the world 
of all ages have come together to pool money 
and other aid to help the victims of this natural 
disaster. Children are donating their entire life’s 
savings and adults are reaching into their funds 
to contribute what they can. Text messages are 
being sent and websites have turned into Help 
Haiti advertisements. Even on Carnegie Melton's 
campus, students have reached out to members of 
the campus community to donate clothes, food, and 
money. UPS has even allowed free shipping into the 
country for packages under 50 pounds.
While it’s been said that no help is too small, many 
of the world's greatest leaders and musicians have 
come together to put on various telethons and 
concerts to help raise funds to restore the country. 
Grammy-winning artist Wyclef Jean, who was 
born in Croix-des-Bouguets, Haiti and later moved 
to Brooklyn, N.Y. has led efforts to raise money by 
creating the non-profit organization called Yele Haiti. 
One of his major campaigns includes cell phone 
users texting “YELE,” which is a cry for freedom, to 
501501, which will automatically donate $5 that will 
appear on the next cell phone bill.
“Hope For Haiti: A Global Benefit for Earthquake 
Relief” — a telethon that was filmed in Los Angeles 
— aired on Jan. 22 and featured many music artists 
in efforts to raise money for Haiti. The telethon was 
transmitted on a wide variety of networks. While 
stars such as English comedian Russell Brand, 
Ashley Tisdale, Vanessa Hudgens, actor Gerard 
Butler, and many others manned the phones, actor 
George Clooney lent a helping hand by speaking 
at the event. Performers including Madonna, Alicia 
Keys, and Jennifer Hudson took the stage to help 
raise money. The earthquake has evidently caused 
people around the world, including those not directly 
impacted by the quake, to speak up.
Artists have even made songs with lyrics speaking 
directly on the earthquake and calling for action. 
Caribbean musician Shaggy has written a song 
called "Rise Again.” The song features Caribbean 
artists such as reggae singer Sean Paul, Haitian 
musician Belo, soca artist Allison Hinds from 
Barbados, and Destra Garcia from Trinidad and 
Tobago. Also, 76-year-old music legend Quincy
Frances Soong | Art Staff
Artists are putting on concerts and benefits and 
releasing special CDs to help Haiti.
Jones is re-recording the song “We are the World” to 
send the proceeds to Haiti. Paste Magazine has also 
brought several artists together to create Songs foi 
Haiti which features released and unreleased songs 
from artists such as Ludacris, Switchfoot, Derek 
Webb, Hanson, and over 200 other singers.
According to a press release, the magazine’s editor- 
in-chief, Josh Jackson, said, “Music has always 
been a force that brings people together, and to 
have so many fantastic artists drop everything 
to contribute to this effort was very touching.” In 
various states across the nation, and around the 
world, local musicians are holding events to raise 
money for Haiti. Right here in Pittsburgh, jazz diva 
Phat Man Dee put on an event called “Send back 
the Spirit” on Jan. 21 at the Shadow Lounge in East 
Liberty with a $10 cover charge, and 10 percent of 
the bar’s sales were sent to support the victims in 
Haiti. Dee worked with club owner Justin Strong to 
get performers for the event. “Shadow Lounge has 
always been active in the local and international 
community,” Strong said. “If there’s a way to 
support, we’re going to do it.”
Efforts are still in progress to bring Haiti back on its 
feet. If you want to help out in any way, or make a 
donation, please visit www.yele.org.

This week, the EOC will herald a new age in terms of handing 
out a worthless piece of paper to people who don’t want to 
hire you. Your ability ascends to savant levels.
Now is the perfect time to contemplate a reversion to 
prepubescent tendencies. Insist that all people of the 
opposite gender have cooties and repeatedly give yourself 
“cootie shots.”
Allow the current fashion trends to rule your wardrobe. If your 
jeans don’t cut off circulation to your lower extremities, soak 
them in cold water for three continuous days.
Let your passions run wild this week. Spending all your 
savings on golf balls and baby carrots will turn out well in the 
end... somehow.
Consider the fact that untrained monkeys regularly fling their 
own feces when they are upset before you buy one from the 
crazy man on the street to keep your house clean.
Overwhelming evidence shows that your life went irretrievably 
wrong on that day in August 1999. You know what you did.
You may want to reconsider dating your current significant 
other until he or she can satisfactorily explain the kumquat 
incident that your friends keep talking about.
It becomes very clear that you are completely incapable of 
running your life independently. Make all of your decisions 
based on the patterns in coffee grounds scattered randomly 
on the ground.
Don’t let logic and historical precedent discourage you; it is 
perfectly reasonable to fight a land war in Asia and invade 
Russia in the winter.
As optimistic and enthusiastic as you may be about the next 
millennium, you probably won’t be around to see it, despite 
your insistence that it is still 1999.
As much as it may seem hilarious to you, gluing all of your 
roommate’s stuff to the ceiling backfires when he or she 
decides that you earned the same treatment, except with 
staples instead of glue.
Think before you speak a little more often. It is important 
to keep in mind that, depending on the region, the verb “to 
plenish” has multiple meanings, not all of them innocent.

Last Friday, the Sidra Bell Dance New York troupe performed at the 
Kelly-Strayhorn Performing Arts Center for a night of contemporary 
dance. The show had a strong female vision, metaphorically exploring 
the complexities of the human condition. Complex, dynamic, and 
haunting, the show was beautifully choreographed and truly a visual 
treat.
