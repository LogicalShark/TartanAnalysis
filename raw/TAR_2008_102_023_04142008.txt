Environmentalism on college 
campuses across the nation may 
now be spreading from student 
groups to primary majors and 
minors. The Oregon Institute 
of Technology was the first col­
lege to create an undergraduate 
major in renewable-energy sys­
tems in 2004. The decision was 
inspired by the growing need 
for students to become more 
aware of environmental issues 
in their lives and careers, in 
light of the strain placed on the 
nation’s resources, acoording to 
Inside Higher Ed.
Since OIT, many other uni­
versities have established simi­
lar programs.
In 2006, the State University 
of New York in Canton started 
a four-year degree program in 
alternative and renewable en­
ergy.
Appalachian State Univer­
sity in Boone, N.C., already of­
fers an undergraduate degree 
in appropriate technology, an 
environmentally and socially 
responsible approach to engi­
neering. In September, Illinois 
State University in Normal will 
establish a major in renewable 
energy.
OIT has reaped nothing but 
success since instituting its 
major in renewable-energy sys­
tems. The professors all attest 
that their students are offered a 
plethora of jobs and that compa­
nies call them constantly trying 
to recruit, according to Inside 
Higher Ed. Renewable-energy 
systems has become the most 
popular major at Oregon.
“We can go into energy au­
diting, solar design, energy 
modeling,” said Mac Lewis, an 
OIT graduate with the renew- 
able-energy systems major, in 
The New York Times. “There are 
engineering firms looking for 
people like me. Photovoltaic 
manufacturers are coming here. 
Wind energy companies. There 
are nonprofit groups that are in­
terested. And that’s just what’s 
going on around Portland.”
Peter Madsen, a professor of 
ethics and social responsibility 
at Carnegie Mellon, explained 
the reasoning behind the cre­
ation of such an area of study.
“We are in the midst of an 
environmental crisis with such 
challenges as global warming, 
ozone depletion, species deci­
mation, and various forms of 
pollution all standing in need of

Carnegie Mellon students 
successfully elected their new 
Student Government Tuesday. 
The Elections Board revealed 
the new executive branch will 
be made up of student body 
president (SBP) Jared Itkowitz, 
a junior business administra­
tion and Chinese studies major; 
student body vice president 
(SBVP) Pooja Godbole, a soph­
omore business administration 
major; and vice president of fi­
nance (SBVPF) Evan Osheroff, 
a junior business administra­
tion major. After the elections 
debacle of last year, where it 
took several failed attempts 
to elect current SBP and SBVP 
Sean Weinstock and Adi Jain, 
this year’s election went off 
without a hitch.
Itkowitz received 1136 votes 
from the student body, roughly 
68 percent of the total elec­
torate. His competitor, junior 
policy and management major 
Dorian Adeyemi, received 489 
votes. Osheroff received 925 
votes, about 62 percent of the 
total number of votes for his
position. His opponent, sopho­
more business administration 
major Sagar Mehta, received 
540 votes, according to stugov. 
andrew. cm u.ed u/elec ti on s/re - 
suits.
“The elections caught me on 
edge,” Osheroff said. “I thought 
it would be closer with [Mehta] 
so I was genuinely surprised 
with the results.”
A total of 1779 students voted 
in the election. Of these, 504 
were students from the Carne­
gie Institute of Technology; 324 
from the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences; 210 from 
the Mellon College of Science; 
143 from the School of Com­
puter Science; 137 from the 
College of Fine Arts; 116 from 
the Bachelor of Humanities and 
Arts, Bachelor of Science and 
Arts (BSA), and Science and 
Humanities Scholars (SHS) 
programs; and 175 graduate 
students.
“I would say the turnout was 
on par,” Osheroff said. “It was 
not great and it could have been 
better.”

University tuition reflects low endowment

For one year of a Carnegie 
Mellon education, entering 
first-years will pay approxi­
mately $50,000, which is the 
cost of a fully-equipped BMW 
convertible. The rise comes at a 
time when Ivy League and top- 
endowed schools like Harvard, 
MIT, and Stanford are cutting 
tuition for middle-class fami­
lies, a move made impossible 
for Carnegie Mellon due to its 
small endowment.
In the latest hike, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Board of Trustees set 
a 6 percent rise in tuition to 
$39,150 that follows an 8 per­
cent increase in 2007-2008, 
outpacing the average 6.3 per­
cent increase colleges experi­
enced that year, according to 
College Board.
However, those increases are 
not adjusted for inflation. Just 
as people nationwide are find­
ing their wallets emptied by gas 
pumps, for example, universi­
ties too are hurt by rising prices. 
Over the last decade, the cost of 
private colleges and universities 
have only increased 2.6 percent 
after including inflation.
“People have become kind 
of numb to the rising costs 
of higher education,” said 
Judith Cole, Carnegie Mellon’s
director of Alumni Relations 
and mother of a son at Hamp- 
son College in Massachusetts. 
“They just throw their hands up 
and bear with it.”
The rising tuition at Carnegie 
Mellon and most other univer­
sities buck the trend being set 
by well-endowed schools like 
Harvard ($35.6 billion), Stan­
ford ($17.1), and MIT ($9.9), 
which are cutting tuition for 
middle-class families even 
as their tuition rises. MIT re­
cently announced that students 
whose families make less than 
$75,000 do not have to pay tu­
ition and will receive grants to 
cover room and board.
“The move by many of the 
top-endowed institutions to 
discount tuition for their middle 
income students is something 
that by and large the higher ed­
ucation community applauds,” 
said Bryan Cook, associate di­
rector of the Center for Policy 
Analysis at the American Coun­
cil on Education. “However, it 
is important to keep in mind 
that many of these institutions 
are among the 10 to 12 larg­
est-endowed universities in the 
country and that the remaining 
95 percent of higher education 
institutions are not in a posi­
tion to do exactly what these

Students kick it up in the ’Burgh
arfmtm iHrjjr.l
Junior Staffwriter
Aside from science and the 
humanities, some Carnegie 
Mellon students are studying 
sneakers this semester. The 
Student College (StuCo), an or­
ganization of classes taught by 
students, debuted a new course 
this semester called Sneakerol- 
ogy 101, a three-credit course 
dealing with the history, cul­
ture, and design of sneakers.
The class will culminate this 
Wednesday with its final exam, 
planning a sneaker festival 
called “Kicksburgh,” aimed at 
promoting urban culture and 
gathering sneakers for charity.
The class was created by El­
liot Curtis, a junior social and 
decision sciences major, and 
Jesse Chorng, a junior econom­
ics major. Curtis and Chorng 
also teach the course.
Curtis and Chorng created 
the class simply for their love of 
sneakers, or “kicks,” as they call 
them.
“There is so much you can 
learn from the culture of sneak­
ers. [This class] really repre­
sents what CMU stands for,” 
Curtis said, citing such exam­
ples as pride and genuineness 
in one’s culture.
The class has gained national 
attention from the media, par­
ticularly from online bloggers 
covering urban culture.
“This makes me want to go 
to CMU,” one user blogged on 
www.sneakerflies.com, an ur­
ban culture discussion forum.
Students taking the class are 
just as excited as the bloggers.
Hannah Pileggi, a sophomore 
statistics major, and Casey Tay­
lor, a junior English major, had 
nothing but positive reviews.
Pileggi described it as an “en­
trepreneurial experience” that 
gave her a wealth of knowledge 
and a new creative outlet.
Taylor is happy that Carnegie 
Mellon is gaining recognition in 
a unique area.
“The class is able to show 
everyone the creative side of 
CMU,” Taylor said.
With 42 students, the class 
was moved to a larger lecture 
hall than initially planned. 
The course covers the history 
of sneakers, present day hip- 
hop fashion, and even features 
guest lecturers.
Taylor praised the class for 
being “proactive about trends” 
and “always up to date.”

New major in global politics will explore analytical social science base
vroRA.O eogrE
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon’s depart­
ment of social and decision sci­
ences (SDS) and the Interna­
tional Relations (IR) Program 
have joined efforts to introduce 
a new major and minor in global 
politics. The major deals with 
the intersection of culture, poli­
tics, markets, and technology; 
the overlap between domestic 
politics and international re­
lations; and the challenging 
process of economic, social, and 
political transitions.
Extracting lessons from stud­
ies in ideology, identity, reli­
gion, culture, and technology, 
the new major aims to instruct 
students on the analytical 
groundwork of international 
relations. In contrast to the in­
ternational relations major — 
which requires the declaration 
of a primary major in a differ­
ent department — students will
be able to choose this area of 
study as a primary major.
Global politics is also avail­
able as an additional major 
and minor, allowing students 
to explore additional areas of 
interest.
“This new major blends the 
social science track of the in­
ternational relations major 
with the international aspects 
of the political science ma­
jor, offering students skills 
and theories through which 
to understand global and in­
ternational relations from the 
perspective of analytical social 
science,” said Traci Sebastian, 
advisor of the IR Program.
According to Sebastian, even 
though no single discipline 
can encompass all aspects of a 
global society, analytical social 
science can offer a consider­
able basis of understanding, 
and this is exactly what global 
politics intends to do.
The new major has received
an enthusiastic response 
from students, Sebastian 
said. Even before the ma­
jor was announced last 
week, students who had 
heard about it unofficially 
contacted her in hopes of 
declaring it their major.
“In the two days follow­
ing the announcement of 
the major, traffic to our 
website nearly tripled,” Se­
bastian said.
Along with SDS and 
IR faculty members, Se­
bastian believes it is an 
exciting opportunity for 
students not only to suc­
cessfully prepare for 
careers in global and inter­
national affairs, but also 
to acquire knowledge and 
skills that will help them to 
grow into better citizens of 
the global community.
Sebastian has been giv­
ing presentations about 
the major to some newly
admitted students and their 
parents, and a considerable 
amount have expressed interest 
in pursuing global politics when 
they begin at Carnegie Mellon 
in the fall.
The global politics major, 
while integrating various de­
partments, does not have a 
foreign language requirement.
According to Susan G. Polan- 
sky, professor and head of the 
Modern Languages department, 
learning a foreign language, al­
though not required, is ideal for 
any student wishing to pursue 
any kind of global studies.
“My personal opinion is that 
the study of modern languages 
is very important for an indi­
vidual seriously pursuing work 
in global studies in order to de­
velop knowledge and familiarity 
with the associated culture or 
cultures,” she said. “The new 
major offers a fine opportunity 
for students to pursue their

Preparation begins for Spring Carnival
Despite on-and-off heavy rain and thunderstorms Friday night, organizations moved their 
booths onto Midway as planned. Above, the sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta move their frames 
from their chapter house. The work continued on the booths late into the night and is ex­
pected to go on through the week. By Thursday afternoon, all work on booths is required to 
stop as Carnival officially begins.
In three days, booths, buggies, concerts, and comedians will take over 
Midway, the Cut, Schenley Park, and all around campus as Spring 
Carnival 2008 takes the stage. The celebration of Carnival has a long 
history at the university. It began back in 1914 as “May Day,” a one-day 
event celebrating school spirit, and has expanded to become all that it 
is today. Here is a look at the history of Carnival:

Three Carnegie Mellon researchers 
recently received the National Science 
Foundation’s Faculty Early Career 
Development (CAREER) award, the most 
prestigious award for junior faculty given 
by the foundation.
Computer scientist Anind K. Dey, 
an assistant professor in the School 
of Computer Science’s Human and 
Computer Interaction Institute, received 
a five-year, $500,000 award for his work 
on making intelligent, interactive sys­
tems easier to understand. Dey’s work 
focuses on intelligent systems that gather 
information about users’ preferences and 
environment.
Psychologist Erik Thiessen, an assistant 
professor of psychology in the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, received
a five-year, $450,000 award for his work 
on how infants acquire language skills. 
Thiessen’s work focuses on identifying 
how predictable, interrelated aspects of 
language helps infants overcome spe­
cific challenges, which could assist chil­
dren with developmental disabilities and 
adults learning a second language.
Biomedical engineer and assistant pro­
fessor Stefan F. Zappe received a five- 
year, $400,000 award for his work on 
developing microelectromechanical sys­
tems (MEMS)-based fruit fly embryo in­
jection technologies. The innovations will 
use ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference 
screens, and will aid in systematic stud­
ies on how genes function and diseases 
develop.

Through a collaboration with 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Art and 
Lamar Outdoor Advertising, nine stu­
dents now have their art displayed on 
billboards in the Pittsburgh area, for 
the second year in a row.
According to a university press 
release, the project began last year, 
when Visiting Assistant Professor 
Christopher Sperandio contacted 
Lamar Outdoor Advertising about us­
ing local billboards as a way to train 
students in graphic artwork targeted 
at the general public.
Last year, Lamar bought four 11 by 
24 foot billboards around Pittsburgh 
for the students; this year, the num­
ber of billboards doubled. Sperandio, 
along with School of Art associate
professors Ayanah Moor and Kim 
Beck, invited their sophomore print- 
making students to create art for the 
billboards.
The press release stated that 40 stu­
dents competed for the eight available 
billboard spaces, with art designed 
specifically for a Pittsburgh audience. 
Winners were selected by Elizabeth 
Thomas, the Phyllis Wattis MATRIX 
curator in Berkeley, Califor., former 
associate curator of contemporary art 
at the Carnegie Museum of Art, and 
guest curator at The Andy Warhol 
Museum.

However, students of all majors 
have the chance to expand their 
environmental knowledge.
Carnegie Mellon's Green De­
sign institute is a multtdisd- 
plinary research initiative, par« 
lieu lady ibr graduate students, 
aimed at forming partnerships 
wit h outside organizations to de­
velop design and manufacturing 
polities that can improve envi­
ronmental quality.
The university is also home to 
a number of environmental orga« 
nlza&ons that, although not aca­
demic majors, provide students 
with a broad knowledge base in 
environmentalism.
Sustainable Earth, ibr ex­
ample, has partnered with the 
American College and University 
Presidents Climate Commitment, 
a pledge aimed at addressing 
global warming by encouraging 
institutional change. 
Additionally, the Bco rep pro­
gram allows students in each 
residential a rea to represent their 
college and spread environmen­
tal awareness through such ac­
tions as recycling.
These organizations are just a 
lew of the many open to students 
on campus who are looking to 
learn more about the environ­
ment in which they live,
Madsen suggested that the 
organizations are a reflection of 
increasing concern for the en­
vironment. as well as a means
of addressing environmental 
change.
“The demand for graduates 
who have expertise in environ­
mental issues has grown expo­
nentially in the last few years,” 
Madsen said, "It seems as if every 
major organization has Jumped 
upon the 'green’ bandwagon," 
Carnegie Mellon has its own 
ways of paying for its environ 
mental programs and initiatives.
“There are many who would 
argue, myself included, that 
the university has a duty to do 
research and educate students 
about the various aspects of the 
environmental crisis,” Madsen 
said. “Thus, we are fortunate to 
have the Steinbrenner Institute 
for Environmental Education 
and Research (SEER! which has 
been instrumental in stimulating 
much work on the environment 
here at CMIJ along with many 
other significant environmental 
programs spread throughout the 
campus”
SEER provides a consider­
able amount of funding to 
the university,
However, while Davidson 
praised Carnegie Melton'S green 
awareness, lie mentioned that 
even more could be done ,
"We are leademn both research 
and education, but we need to do 
more,” Davidson said. “As the im­
portance of the environmental 
field continues to grow, the size 
of the CMIJ community devoted 
to environmental issues needs to 
grow as well/"
8IL0BM, from Ai
interests in global studies,*
SDS professor John II. Miller 
defended the major's lack of a 
foreign language requirement, 
explaining that most students in 
t he global politics program will 
be inclined to study a language 
on their own, even without a set 
requirement.
There are other ways of 
endorsing the completion of 
modern language tunmiDil he 
added.
“We strongly encourage stu­
dents to combine the new major 
with the study of modern lan­
guages, and do this through our

our immediate attention,3" Mad­
sen said, “Programs at colleges 
and universities that will assist 
students to become adept as en­
vironmental problem solvers will 
likely be in demand for some time

Cliff Davidson, a professor of 
civil and environmental engi­
neering, commented on the high 
level of need for undergraduates 
who are educated in environ« 
mentaiism.
"We aren’t doing a very good 
job now [of dealing with in­

Carnegie Mellon increases tuition with its small endowment to blame
*H!s never easy for the f rus tees 
to approve ruirion increases,* 
Elliott said.
Compared to other schools, 
Carnegie Mellon is already 
more reliant on tuition dollars
— as well as its endowment
— to provide financial aid and 
balance the university's budget. 
The Board of Trustees allows 5 
percent of the endowment to 
be contributed to the operating 
budget: of the university each 
year. According to Inside Higher 
Ed, among the universities with 
the 25 largest endowments, 
only a handful reported spend­
ing more than 5 percent of their 
endowment each year.
Carnegie Me lion's endow 
ment contribution to the 
operating budget at 5 percent 
this year was only $55 million. 
MIT, for instance» only spent 
4.3 percent of its endowment 
in 2007, and that was approxi* 
maiefy $425 million.
The implications of Harvard* 
Stanford, and MIT’s tuition cuts 
for the middle class are hard 
to gauge as Harvard, Stanford, 
and MIT remain among the 
most prestigious — and selec­
tive schools in the United 
States. The, Wall Street Journal 
reported that Harvard accep­
tance rate was 7.1 percent, a 
record low.
Even though Carnegie Mel- 
Ion’s tuition is the 10th highest 
in the nation, MIT’s t uition cuts 
probably will not draw students 
away from Carnegie Mellon and 
other schools, according to the 
2006 Admitted Student Ques­
tionnaire* gathered before fi­
nancial aid. Student s who were 
accepted to both Carnegie Mel 
Ion and MIT chose MIT 97 per­
cent of the time ,
Besides., Elliott is reading: 
more undergraduate applica­
tions than ever before as the 
numbers of applications have 
set and broken records the last 
few years, Carnegie Melton's 
acceptance rate has plummeted 
from 42 percent in 2004 to 34 
percent in 2006 to 28 percent in
2007,
‘The number of applications, 
tells us that students value
what we deliver — an interdis­
ciplinary, diverse, international 
approach to education that is 
also of great quality/ Elliott 
said in a Carnegie Mellon press 
release.
Alumnus Sam Grego, whose 
son is a junior at Carnegie Mel» 
Ion, thinks Carnegie Mellon is 
worth the price tag, Tie (my 
son | wouldn’t be going t here if I 
didn't think that/ he said.
While many parents and stu­
dents think Carnegie Mellon is 
worth $50,000 a year, some st u­
dents disagree.
“I don’t think CMU is worth it 
at alL I don’t thi ok people shou td 
have to pay a fortune to get an 
education* said Nicholas Cole, 
a Junior history and anthropol­
ogy major* "especially when it 
wilt take most of us a long, long 
time to pay off what we spent 
here, even longer in this job 
market land] economy/
Cole mentioned that he has 
difficu lty paying not only his lit» 
ition, but his housing and living 
costs as well. At one time. Cole 
worked three jobs to cover his 
expenses* but he felt overloaded 
and had to switch to two.
T would not. select this col» 
lege again,” said Cole, who 
nearly transferred out of Car» 
negie Mellon twice, alter his 
first year and then again after 
t he first semester of his sopho­
more year, T enjoy most of my 
classes, but 1 don't have the 
time or presence of mind to en.» 
joy doing the readings all the 
time, participate in the discus­
sions often, or do what I feel is 
quality work withoul sacrificing 
something else.”
Paying tuition is not only a 
challenge during school; ac­
cording Jo College Board, the 
average indebtedness of Car­
negie Mellon students after 
graduation is $39,346, more 
than double the average indebt, 
edness of Stanford graduates, 
for instance C$16,728),
So, until Carnegie Mellon can 
expand its endowment and cut 
tuition, students and parents in­
terested in attending will, have 
to bear wit h the high costs and 
meet them however they can,
itbuuJi bfMD durD/
With a 65ih-ranked endow­
ment, Carnegie Mellon is not in 
a place to follow the top-ranked 
Harvard and other institutions. 
The exact difference between 
Carnegie Melton's endow 
ment and that of Harvard is 
$33,519,166.
“What has resulted from the 
polities of the Harvard s and 
Yales is that many schools are 
having conversations about 
what things they can do to 
make college more affordable 
to more students, and this is 
certainly a welcomed conversa­
tion/ Cook said. “Still, the fact 
remains that the large majority 
of schools will not be able to 
recreate these policies, as their 
much-smaller endowments re­
quire them to cover a wide rage 
of campus needs, in addit ion to 
student aid/
While Carnegie Mellon does 
not offer free tuition or reduced 
costs based on income bracket, 
it has increased its financial 
aid to match the higher tuition 
rates. According to a univer­
sity press release, more than 63 
percent of Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents received financial aid this 
academic year,
Cole, who worked at Yale for 
.17 years before coming to Car­
negie Mellon, offered insight 
into the well-endowed universi­
ties’ decisions to cut tuition for 
the middle class.
'They feel a true obligation 
to make their educations more 
available regardless of one’s fi­
nancial means/* he said* "Money 
should not be the reason you 
can’t go there/
However, tuition costs do 
keep some studen t s from attend 
ing Carnegie Mellon. According 
to Elliot, not every student who 
is qualified to attend Carnegie 
Mellon actually can, as some 
students’ financial needs are 
too great for Carnegie Mellon 
t,o match. Elliott has had “pain­
ful” discussions with students, 
saying he is disappointed when 
finances prevent students from 
coming to Carnegie Mellon.

Students study sneakers and take final exam through citywide festival
StuCo class examines urban culture through sneakers
SNEAKERS, fromAl
Sneakerology 101 is anything 
but conventional.
The midterm exam was to 
design the “ideal sneaker.” One 
notable concept was Taylor’s 
line of “bearded shoes.”
“I don’t think enough peo­
ple appreciate beards through 
shoes,” Taylor said.
For the final exam, both 
students and teachers are col­
laborating to throw a sneaker 
festival.
The first “Kicksburgh” will 
be held in Skibo Gym this 
Wednesday.
The festival promotes the 
charity organization Soles- 
4Souls, which distributes 
donated shoes to those affected 
by disasters such as Hurricane 
Katrina.
There will be collection bins 
around campus for both new 
and used shoes.
Chorng and Curtis describe 
the festival as “a really cool 
event involving the entire city,” 
and hope to “promote urban 
culture in Pittsburgh.”
From 6 to 10 p.m., the event 
will feature local urban bou­
tiques (including TimeBomb, 
SolellSole, oneUP Skateshop, 
and Ulterior Motive) and 
local brands (including vita- 
minTHICK and The D.O.N. or 
Definition of NYCE).
There will also be live art by 
local DJs and painters, a trivia 
game, and an appearance by 
the campus’breakdance crew, 
the International FreeStylers, 
among other activities.
The two teachers hope that 
many will see the event as a 
great kick-off to this year’s 
Carnival.
In addition to working on 
this year’s festival, the pair is 
already planning for years to 
come.
Curtis and Chorng hope 
Sneakerology sticks around 
campus, and are actively looking 
for their successors.
Pileggi is just happy that she 
was able to “watch the birth of 
something that’s going to be 
big,” she said.
She also expressed her antici­
pation for the festival.
“If this is a success, it’s a huge 
deal. Not only for Elliott and 
Jesse, but for all of us students 
as well,” she said.
When asked if they had any 
last comments, Pileggi, speak­
ing for herself and Taylor, said, 
“We think Elliott and Jesse 
sh9uld get paid.”
For those who missed out this 
semester, Curtis has agreed 
to teach the class again next 
spring.

staff writer for The Tartan.

Itkowitz and Godbole, Osheroff win votes for new executive branch
rent student; last year, without 
this modification, multiple stu­
dents were able to vote for Opti- 
mus Prime (a Transformer) via 
write-in, Richards explained. 
At the end of the voting pro­
cess, the system tallied, stored, 
and computed the votes and put 
them in a results table, after 
which Richards added all votes 
for write-ins.
Despite the ease of the pro­
cess, however, candidates were 
glad to be done.
“The election is a draining 
process,” Itkowitz said.
“We’re just relieved we don’t 
have to do it again,” Godbole 
added.
Richards believes that the 
new system is a model that 
will work in the long term. To 
ensure longevity, she included 
an admin page with explicit 
instructions, so all configura­
tions could be handled from the 
webfront (website) end by her 
successor.
But Richards is still planning 
to improve the system for next 
year’s elections. She’d like to ex­
pand the suite of administrative 
utilities, increase performance, 
and create error messages that 
correspond to the particular 
problematic field, instead of a 
general message.
However, she was pleased 
with the way elections went 
this year.
“We were out by 9:45 [p.m.], 
not 4 a.m.,” she said. “We had a 
much better time.”
In addition to Richards, the 
Elections Board consists of co­
chairs Sudeep Paul, a senior
business administration and 
economics major, and Ruth 
Poproski, a Ph.D. student in phi­
losophy; Neha Thatte, a senior 
design major; Tarun Bhan, a ju­
nior economics and social and 
decision sciences major; and 
Vivan Shah, a senior electrical 
and computer engineering 
major.
Only days into the process, 
the candidates were ready to 
get started.
“We’re just excited to get out 
there and meet new people,” 
Godbole said.
“And now we have an ex­
cuse,” Itkowitz added.
All three candidates each 
have their own visions; for It­
kowitz and Godbole, they hope 
to initiate their seven CMUnity 
issues including a 24/7 cam­
pus, better student safety, and 
expanding the influence of 
student government into Pitts­
burgh and graduate student af­
fairs. Osheroff hopes to reform 
the Joint Funding Committee 
through a new website, audits 
of all funded organizations, and 
a revised timeline of assigning 
representatives.
They all share the vision of 
increasing transparency, col­
laborating between student 
groups, and integrating one- 
on-one communication with 
the student body.

Tartan.
RESULTS, from A1
student votes ever cast in one 
election is 2537, in 2004, ac­
cording to Student Senate 
minutes.
The relative ease of the elec­
tion process was due in part to 
a new server purchased by the 
Office of Student Activities and 
Student Senate last summer to 
replace the server purchased 
five years ago from a project at 
the Rochester Institute of Tech­
nology (RIT), according to Meg 
Richards, a senior in computer 
science and chief technical of­
ficer (CTO) of the Elections 
Board. In addition, the new 
server is administered by a staff 
member in Enrollment Services 
to heighten security.
“Now we can focus on code 
and not security,” Richards 
said.
However, although there 
is staff involvement at the se­
curity level, the system is still 
operated primarily by students.
“It’s going to be [operated by] 
students and it should be stu­
dents,” Richards said.
In addition, this year’s sys­
tem included a host of updated 
features. For example, can­
didates this year were able to 
submit their platforms online, 
whereas before they submitted 
paper platforms that were later 
retyped by the CTO.
Additionally, Richards con­
figured the system to match 
each name that voters put in as a 
write-in candidate to an Andrew 
ID to ensure that the potential 
candidate was actually a cur-

Evan Osheroff won the election to become next year’s SBVPF. He plans to improve the Budget Tracker 
website, audit all funded student organizations, and assign JFC representatives as early as September. 
Osheroff hopes to work closely with his competitor, Sagar Mehta.

SCS’ Robot Hall of Fame inducts four new robots
iHoRNlRam fm goRjjr.Al
Staffwriter
Though most people are used to 
living with appliances, cars, and 
computers, they do not always 
appreciate this technology’s daily 
impact on their lives. James H. 
Morris, dean of Carnegie Mellon 
West, the Silicon Valley Campus 
felt that robots were similarly 
under-appreciated and thus creat­
ed the Robot Hall of Fame, which 
is now in its sixth year.
“When the robots take over, we 
want them to remember that we 
were the first ones to appreciate 
them,” Morris said jokingly. The 
School of Computer Science estab­
lished the Robot Hall of Fame to 
honor real and fictional robots in 
our society.
There are two categories in 
which robots receive honors: 
Robots from Science and Robots 
from Science Fiction. Robots in 
the science category must have 
served an actual or potentially 
useful function and demonstrated 
real skills in accomplishing their 
purpose. Robots in the fictional 
category must have received 
worldwide fame, inspired others 
to build real robots, and helped 
form opinions about the functions 
and value of robots.
The first robots to be inducted 
into the Hall of Fame were, NASA’s 
Mars Pathfinder Microrover Flight
Experiment (MFEX), better known 
as “Sojourner”; Unimate, the first 
industrial robot; R2-D2, a droid 
from the Star Wars movies; and 
the evil HAL-9000 computer, fea­
tured in the movie 2001: A Space 
Odyssey, created by science fic­
tion writer and futurist Sir Arthur 
C. Clarke and director Stanley 
Kubrick.
Any robot may be nominat­
ed for the Robot Hall of Fame, 
Morris said. Inductees are then 
chosen by an international jury 
of leading thinkers and technol­
ogy developers. The four robots 
being inducted this year — Lt. 
Cmdr. Data, the Raibert Hopper, 
LEGO Mindstorms, NavLab5 — 
were announced last May at the 
RoboBusiness Conference and 
Exposition in Boston. The Raibert 
Hopper, LEGO Mindstorms, and 
NavLab5 were nominated for the 
Robots from Science category, 
while Lt. Cmdr. Data was nom­
inated for Robots from Science 
Fiction.
Lt. Cmdr. Data is an android 
with super strength and a super 
memory that was portrayed by 
actor Brent Spiner during the 
1987-1994 run of Star Trek: The 
Next Generation. His award was 
accepted by Zachary Quinto.

Scientists facilitate self-assembly of nanoparticles
rnranNHr IrRfEr
Asst. SciTech Editor
With the scaling down of many 
devices, nano and microparticles 
have gained prestige in the world 
of technology. However, when 
dealing with devices that use such 
particles, the arrangement of the 
particles is an important factor.
Realizing this importance, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Nadine Aubry, 
head of the mechanical engineer­
ing department and Pushpendra 
Singh, an engineering professor 
at the New Jersey Institute of 
Technology (NJIT), have devel­
oped a new technique for the 
self-assembly of nano- and micro­
particles.
Microparticles have sizes that 
are measured in micrometers, 
where one micrometer is 10'6 
meters.
Nanoparticles are even small­
er. They are generally less than 
100 nanometers in at least one 
dimension (one nanometer is 109 
meters).
The team’s research paper,
titled “Micro- and nanopar­
ticles self-assembly for virtually 
defect-free, adjustable monolay­
ers,” was published last month 
in the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences USA journal. 
As mentioned \in the paper, the 
team’s research deals with the 
self-assembly of particles in two- 
dimensions, or “monolayers,” 
placed at a liquid interface.
A monolayer is a single layer of 
particles, and a liquid interface is 
a surface where two liquids come 
in contact with one another. The 
free surface of a liquid, which is in 
contact with air, is also considered 
to be a liquid interface.
Self-assembly of particles 
at liquid interfaces was previ­
ously based on capillary forces. 
Capillary forces cause particles at 
the surface of a liquid to attract 
one another.
Aubry explained these forces by 
giving the analogy of a breakfast 
cereal. “When you have your bowl 
of milk with cereal, you put the 
cereal on top of the milk. If you 
wait long enough, you are going
to see that the [flakes] gather. 
That is because of the capillary 
force which makes the particles 
attract one another,” she said.
Although this technique has 
been in use for quite some time, it 
has a number of drawbacks.' One 
of the major drawbacks is that it 
does not work well for small par­
ticles that have a radius less than 
10 microns.
“If you have very small par­
ticles, they don’t cluster together 
because their weight is not large 
enough,” Singh said.
Aubry mentioned two other 
drawbacks of this technique. 
Firstly, using this technique makes 
it difficult to arrange particles into 
regular patterns. “When we want 
to make a material, we want it to 
be as regular as possible,” Aubry 
said. Therefore, the final materi­
als may be defective.
Secondly, after self-assembly 
the particles touch each other. 
Many devices require the parti­
cles to have gaps between them. 
Such an arrangement cannot be 
achieved by relying solely on cap­
illary forces.
Aubry and Singh’s new method 
provides a solution to all of these 
problems.
In their model, electrodes are 
placed above and below the sur­
face of the liquid so-that an elec­
tric field can be generated perpen­
dicular to the free surface of the 
liquid that the particles are on.
Aubry explained that the elec­
tric field generates electrostatic 
forces acting on the particles, 
which can be split up into vertical 
and lateral components.
The vertical component of the 
force moves the particles in its 
direction, causing capillary forces 
to arise in the lateral direction. 
Unlike capillary forces generat­
ed without the use of an electric 
field, these capillary forces are 
capable of moving even small, 
lightsweight particles.
Along with these capillary forc­
es, lateral repulsive forces are also 
generated, which prevent the par­
ticles from coming close enough

Male contraception 
methods proposed
Specialists reviewed new 
methods for male contraception 
at the Future of Male Contra­
ception conference, sponsored 
by the U.S. National Institutes 
of Health and held in Seattle 
last September.
Ronald Swerdloff, an endo­
crinologist and chief of the divi­
sion of endocrinology at Harbor- 
UCLA and professor of medicine 
at the Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center in Los Angeles, proposed 
two methods at the conference. 
One method involved hormonal 
therapy and testicular warming 
to control the release of sperm.
The other involved transder- 
mal gels; men either applied a 
progestin gel called Nestorone 
or a testosterone gel, or they 
applied both. The researchers 
concluded that the combination 
of transdermal gels worked the 
best to suppress sperm.
Also, researchers at Colum­
bia University tested a drug that 
interfered with vitamin A re­
ceptors in the testes, which are 
known to reduce fertility.

Researchers find 
benefits in worrying
Gregory Samanez-Larkin, a 
psychology graduate student 
at Stanford, found that people 
who worried more scored better 
in a financial game. A person’s 
likelihood of worrying was 
judged by scans of activity in a 
part of the brain known as the 
anterior insula.
An active anterior insula in­
dicated higher chances of un­
certainty in terms of financial 
decisions.
Samanez-Larkin said the re­
search could be used to detect 
people who are most likely to 
use too many credit cards or get 
into financial trouble like incur­
ring debts.

New drug protects 
against radiation
Researchers have developed 
a new drug that can protect 
healthy cells and bone marrow 
against radiation therapy used 
to cure cancer.
The new drug, known as 
CBLB502, has been shown to 
protect the gastrointestinal 
cells and bone marrow in mice 
and monkeys from radiation, 
but does not reduce the treat­
ment’s effectiveness.
Lyudmila Burdelya, a scien­
tist in New York state’s Roswell 
Park Cancer Institute, showed 
that CBLB502 works by activat­
ing a molecular pathway that 
some cancer cells use to prevent 
cell death.
Clinical trials on humans may 
begin this summer.

Diet supplements 
could be harmful
Recent studies suggest that 
dietary supplements such as 
over-the-counter vitamins and 
minerals may potentially harm 
individuals, especially when 
taken in large doses, and in 
combination with each other or 
other prescription drugs.
Six natural sources, namely 
reen tea, grapeseed, ginkgo bi- 
loba, turmeric, salmon oil, and 
itamin E have been found to 
increase bleeding after an abra­
sion or surgery. The chemical 
properties of these substances 
i 3 hibit platelet aggregation, 
which is necessary to form 
blood clots.
According to a 2002 Harris 
poll, 70 percent of adults in the 
United States take vitamins, 
minerals, herbs, and/or other 
supplements.

Ancient rocks found 
at North Pole
Jonathan Snow, an assistant 
professor of geosciences at the 
University of Houston, revealed 
unmixed rocks composed of os­
mium (a metal rarer than plati­
num) at the floor of the Arctic 
Ocean. Findings show that the 
rocks are probably 2 billion 
years old. The expedition, led 
by Snow, was carried out at the 
North Pole.
This contradicts the age-old 
theory that the rocks beneath 
the earth’s surface were homog­
enous.
Scientists are now interested 
in studying why these rocks re­
main unmixed. This will give 
more insight into the history of 
the mantle layer.

War could lead to 
ozone depletion
Researchers fear that nuclear 
wars between South Asian 
countries like India and Paki­
stan would result in a large hole 
in the ozone layer. The studies 
are based on computer models 
that suggest the amount of fire 
produced by a nuclear war in 
the region.
Scientists believe that smoke 
will be the prime cause of this 
destruction of the ozone layer. 
Fires in the cities could send an 
estimated 5 million tons of soot 
into the troposphere, the lowest 
parts of the atmosphere. Heat 
from the sun will carry the par­
ticles to the stratosphere, where 
chemical reactions will lead to 
ozone depletion.
Holes in the ozone layer al­
low ultraviolet radiation from 
the sun to reach Earth, causing 
cancer in humans, in addition 
to further permanent damage 
to animals and plants.

Fake diamonds 
protect engines
Scientists discovered that zir- 
conia, a substance found in fake 
diamonds, can make jet engines 
run faster, with more fuel effi­
ciency, and for longer amounts 
of time. Zirconia can be used to 
coat the engines’ turbine blades, 
preventing the damage caused 
by sand.
The coated blades suck the 
air and increase the pressure 
inside, leading to better fuel 
ignition. The high-pressure air 
expelled from the hind of the 
plane allows it to move farther.
The special zirconium coat­
ing inside the engine also pro­
tects it from extreme tempera­
tures, which could otherwise 
cause the engine to expand or 
contract.

IBM works on ‘race­
track memory’
IBM is working on a technol­
ogy called “racetrack memory,” 
which will result in devices ca­
pable of storing 100 times more 
data than present MP3 players.
The technology uses mag­
netic boundaries made of nano­
wires to store data. Nanowires 
are essentially shrunken-down 
versions of modern day wires 
and are less than 100 nanome­
ters in size. The data travels (or 
races) through wires simultane­
ously as it is being read.
This storage medium is ex­
pected to be fast, durable, and 
cheap. It has the potential to re­
place the presently used storage 
devices such as flash memory 
and hard drives. However, sci­
entists still suspect that it may 
take seven. to eight years to 
commercialize the product.

j­-2­-0p4 Understanding cancer
SHEILA PRAKASH
Two years ago, I had the plea­
sure of interviewing professor 
Randy Pausch for an alumni 
article about the Entertainment 
Technology Center. In the re­
cent wake of his exuberant and 
downright remarkable approach 
to his pancreatic cancer diagno­
sis, I wanted to explain, to the 
best of my ability, what cancer 
is, and why it is so difficult to 
target.
An adult human body contains 
approximately 10 trillion cells. 
These cells grow and divide in 
an orderly manner. When old 
cells die, new cells proliferate to 
take their places.
This is an interesting point, 
and has important implications 
for cancer. The cells in the hu­
man body are in flux. They are 
constantly maturing, multiply­
ing, and dying. To the naked 
eye, this turnover is undetect­
able because the body kills un­
necessary cells and replaces 
missing ones so quickly that the 
body’s overall cell count appears 
unchanging.
Imagine a company that hires 
and fires employees at a faster- 
than-normal rate. Within min­
utes of an employee being fired, 
another employee appears by 
the cubicle to take his spot. Over 
the course of a week, the staff 
number at the company is the 
same, but the employees are all 
new. The same applies to the 
cells in the human body.
In order for the body to main­
tain this perfect balance in cell 
number, the cell’s life cycle has 
to be strictly regulated.
Going back to the company, 
imagine it loses its firing depart­
ment to the flu. The firing de­
partment is sick, and cannot ex­
ecute orders to fire employees, 
but the company is still hiring. 
Eventually, the building will be 
swamped with employees. Des­
perate for space, they crawl into 
the ventilation ducts, hang from 
the rafters, and occupy closets 
and bathrooms.
The hiring department is 
hiring out of control because 
there is no firing department 
to counterbalance it. The com­
pany has cancer, and if the prob­
lem is not fixed, employees will
smash pipes, shatter windows, 
and break down walls until the 
building collapses.
The biological mechanism for 
this is fairly simple. The heart 
and soul of a cell is its DNA. A 
single piece of DNA contains all 
the information necessary to en­
code every single protein in the 
body.
In order for a cell to divide 
into two cells, it has to split this 
DNA into two copies — one for 
each cell. If the cell approaches 
its first checkpoint with faulty 
DNA, the birthday party is over.
It cannot proceed to the next 
phase in its life cycle until its 
DNA is repaired. Faulty DNA 
contains mutations, or errors, in 
the code.
As such, several proteins, en­
coded by the DNA will also be 
faulty. This is bad, because some 
of these proteins are responsible 
for cell division.
There is one protein chiefly 
responsible for regulating cell 
cycle control. In 1993, it was 
named Science magazine’s Pro­
tein of the Year. The protein is 
called p53, and it stops the cell 
containing faulty DNA from di­
viding. In addition, p53 alsp re­
cruits the enzymes necessary to 
repair the DNA. If the damaged 
DNA is not fixed, p53 targets the 
cell for destruction.
Thus, p53 takes the role of the 
hiring and firing departments. 
As such, one of the most preva­
lent mutations leading to cancer 
is in the gene that makes p53. 
Because of its role in cell cycle 
regulation, p53 is called a proto­
oncogene.
When proto-oncogenes con­
tain a mutation, they become 
oncogenes.
Oncogenes cause cells to di­
vide wildly and dangerously. If 
inherited, they can sometimes 
(but not always) give rise to can­
cer.
A second group of genes, tu­
mor suppressor genes, is also 
important in cell-cycle control. 
Tumor suppressor genes code 
for proteins that inhibit cell 
growth.
Like proto-oncogenes, defects 
in tumor suppressor genes give 
rise to cancer.
Out of the roughly 35,000 
genes in the body, only a small 
percentage of genes (the proto­
oncogenes and the tumor sup­
pressor genes) are related to 
cancer — p53 is a remarkable 
protein that functions as a tumor 
suppressor gene and a proto-on­
cogene.
Mutations in either set of 
genes can be inherited, or they 
can occur through environmen­
tal exposures to carcinogens.
A well-known oncogene is 
RAS, which is found on chromo­
some 11. Thirty percent of all 
tumors have a mutation in RAS. 
MYC is an oncogene associated 
with Burkitt’s lymphoma, a 
cancer of the lymphatic system. 
Hereditary breast cancer results 
in inherited mutations in the 
tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 
and BRCA2.
Sometimes, cells contain mu­
tations. Almost all of the time, 
the mutations are repaired. In 
rare cases, particularly bad mu­
tations (mutations in the cell 
cycle) pass on from cell to cell. 
These cells form a tumor.
Because cancerous cells can 
appear at any given time, and 
with no warning, the only cur­
rent treatment of cancer is che­
motherapy, which kills rapidly
dividing cells. But cancer must 
exist as a clump of hundreds 
of cells exhibiting abnormal 
growth (a tumor) before it can 
be seen — making the individ­
ual targeting of cancerous cells 
impossible.
In the cancerous company, 
the employees will eventually 
die of starvation. The problem 
arises not when the employees 
are swarming the building, but 
when they are given food and 
water to survive. This is angio- 
genesis, and it is the process a tu­
mor goes through to find nearby 
blood vessels to feed itself. With­
out this blood supply, the tumor 
cannot spread, or metastasize. It 
is benign.
Put another way, uncontrolled 
cell growth is only mildly bad 
until it hunts out blood vessels 
to sustain itself.
When a tumor recruits blood 
vessels, it. comes to life. Now 
cells can slip off the tumor and 
into the blood stream.
From here, they can latch onto 
any tissue in the body and start 
the process anew. Cancer has 
entered the building — and it is 
not leaving anytime soon.
How Things Work: Nanotechnology

A carbon nanotube pattern in the form of hexagons.
The first is the bottom-up approach, in 
which small particles are arranged in an 
orderly manner to form larger, complex 
objects.
The second approach is the top-down 
approach, where large objects are scaled 
down to a smaller size.
Depending on what device or technol­
ogy is to be developed, either approach 
can be employed.
The applications of nanotechnology 
span a variety of different fields, rang­
ing from quantum physics to medicine.
Perhaps one of the most popular ap­
plications has been in the field of drug 
delivery.
Chemotherapy has been used to treat 
cancer since early 1940s. Traditional 
chemotherapy, which does not involve 
nanotechnology, has a number of side 
effects that make the treatment painful 
for the patient. The main reason for this 
is that chemotherapy affects all types of 
cells and does not specifically target the 
cancerous cells.
New technology now enables scientists
to attach RNA molecules to nanopar­
ticles filled with chemotherapy drugs. 
The RNA molecules are synthesized such 
that they specifically target cancerous 
cells. Therefore, the drugs are delivered 
only to cancerous cells, leaving the other 
cells of the body unharmed.
Another application is the creation 
of extremely strong materials. Carbon 
nanotubes consist of allotropes, or dif­
ferent forms of carbon. These have as- 
tonisKing properties; one of which is 
strength, making them useful in devices
like bulletproof jackets.
. Nanotechnology is also being applied 
to produce different kinds of fabrics. 
Clothes can now be coated with zinc 
oxide nanoparticles, which act as protec­
tion from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. 
Some clothes also have little hair-like 
nanoparticles on them, which can repel 
water and dirt particles to make the 
clothes stain free. Stain-resistant cloth­
ing and pain-free chemotherapy are defi­
nitely useful innovations, but the best is 
yet to come.
Researchers now believe that using 
nanotechnology, virtually any object can 
be manufactured out of thin air.
These materials will actually be built 
out of atoms, since atoms and molecules 
can stick together because of magnetic 
and electrical properties.
If the particles are carefully manipu­
lated, they can be ordered into a regular 
structure. Scientists hope to accomplish 
this using nanomachines called “as­
semblers,” which can be programmed 
to organize the particles into ordered 
structures as complex as computers. This 
technology, known as “molecular manu­
facturing,” may soon become a reality.
While nanotechnology has some peo­
ple dreaming of a futuristic world, it 
comes with its drawbacks.
Particles have very different properties 
when they are in bulk or in a large cluster 
compared to when they are separated 
into nano-sized particles.
Scientists fear that some molecules 
which we know to be harmless may 
actually be harmful when they are nano­
sized. Making clothing or drug delivery 
devices out of such materials may there­
fore be extremely dangerous.
Another concern is that since nano­
particles can have atomic physical and 
chemical properties, they may be used to 
create potentially disastrous weapons.
If used in the right way, though, nano­
technology can definitely prove to be an 
asset to mankind. As for college students, 
what was once a dead weight on their 
shoulders may eventually be merely tiny 
lumps in their pockets.
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
A college student might spend the 
night nursing a sore back because of 
carrying around volumes of books and 
a laptop all day. Given this, it is reason­
able enough to wish for a scrap of paper 
which would have everything written on 
it. However, compared to particles that 
are one-billionth of a meter in each di­
mension, a scrap of paper is gigantic.
Thanks to the field of nanotechnology, 
the word “small” has a taken on a com­
pletely new definition. Nanotechnology 
deals with particles within the range of 
nanometers. (A nanometer is 10‘9 me­
ters.)
Although we can easily imagine such 
an idea today, it would have found its 
place in science fiction books some de­
cades ago.
The concept of nanotechnology was 
proposed almost 50 years ago, when 
the bizarre idea of consolidating vol­
umes of information onto a tiny surface 
was discussed by Nobel Prize-winner 
Richard Feynman. Feynman introduced 
nanotechnology in a talk called “There’s 
Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” delivered 
at the annual meeting of the American 
Physical Society at the California Institute 
of Technology (Caltech).
In the talk, given in 1959, Feynman 
asked, “Why cannot we write the en­
tire 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia 
Britannica on the head of a pin?”
Feynman then explained his ideas for 
why putting an entire encyclopedia on 
a pin is possible and how it can be done. 
Although the talk probably raised a lot of 
eyebrows at that time, it got people think­
ing about nanotechnology and brought 
the field to where it stands today.
Nanotechnologists use devices like the 
scanning tunneling microscope, which 
takes images of the arrangement of at­
oms in a particular substance.
After knowing the arrangement of 
atoms in a substance, two different ap­
proaches can be used to create nano­
devices.
Health Talk: Sleeping foot
CLAIRE MORGENSTERN
Have you ever tried to get up 
and take a step after sitting in 
a strange position, only to find 
that one of your feet has “fallen 
asleep”?
Yet, after a tingling or burn­
ing sensation in the affected limb 
subsides, the foot returns to nor­
mal. However, the process is more 
complicated than that; “sleeping 
foot,” or “paresthesia,” is actually 
caused by blocked nerve path­
ways or arteries, preventing the 
regular flow of electrochemical 
impulses from reaching the brain.
Electrochemical impulses are 
ransmitted by the body’s neurons, 
:ells in the nervous system that 
are responsible for transmitting 
information. This process allows 
for rapid communication between 
different parts of the body.
When pressure is exerted on 
a foot, arm, or leg over a sus­
tained period of time, it can com­
press arteries in that area, which 
means that the arteries lose the 
ability to transport nutrients like 
oxygen and glucose to the tissues 
and nerve cells in the affected 
area, which they need to function
normally.
Once the limb is moved, nutri­
ent-fortified blood returns to the 
area, which results in the familiar 
“pins and needles” feeling.
The sensation is caused'by an 
abnormal transmission of signals 
to the brain. Nerve pathways be­
come blocked, and the body can 
no longer send electrochemical 
impulses to the brain.
As a result, the nerves begin to 
behave erratically, sending “mixed 
signals” to the brain. These sig­
nals result in a tingling sensation 
in the affected area.
Once the body changes posi­
tion, the electrochemical impulses 
begin to flow properly. However, 
from the time that the body 
changes position until the time 
when the exchange of electro­
chemical impulses is completely 
restored, the intensity of the tin­
gling increases, causing the “pins 
and needles” feeling.
The “pins and needles” sensa­
tion may dissolve into an uncom­
fortable burning feeling before 
the affected area of the body feels 
normal. The nerve fibers that 
regulate pain, temperature, and 
motor control are thin, allowing 
the victim to move the affected
limb before regaining feeling in it, 
and to feel the tingling sensation 
rather quickly. ,
The burning, however, is 
caused by separate thicker nerve 
fibers that may take longer to be­
gin transmitting electrochemical 
impulses again.
Certain areas of the body are 
more prone to this sensation than 
others. Specifically, nerves that 
are close to the body's surface and 
near a bone are more susceptible 
to paresthesia, such as the median 
nerve in the wrist, which causes 
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome if dam­
aged.
Other common conditions of 
this type include Ulnar Nerve 
Palsy, which occurs from repeat­
edly hitting the nerve close to the 
elbow, or “funny bone”; Peroneal 
Nerve Palsy, also called “foot- 
drop,” which is damage to the 
nerve at the lower part of the 
knee and results in inability to flex 
one’s foot upward; and Radial 
Nerve Palsy, prolonged pressure 
on the nerve on the underside of 
the upper arm.
Radial Nerve Palsy is also called 
“Saturday Night Palsy” because it 
often occurs in people who sleep 
soundly after drinking heavily.
Although uncomfortable, par­
esthesia can actually be benefi­
cial, as the sensation alerts an in­
dividual to change his or her posi­
tion to restore blood flow.
If the blood flow is restricted 
and nerves are compressed for 
several hours, the victim could 
suffer permanent nerve damage, 
called mononeuropathy.
This results more often from 
prolonged pressure on a nerve 
that occurs during sleep or from 
staying in a crouched position for 
a sustained period of time.
However, mononeuropathy 
can also result from accidents, 
extreme cold or heat, radiation 
therapy for some types of cancer, 
and having a cast or crutches that 
do not fit correctly.
“Sleeping foot” is considered 
a temporary mononeuropathy, 
which can be cured by resting, 
not putting pressure on the area, 
or applying heat to the pite of the 
discomfort.
More serious cases of prolonged 
nerve compression, however, may 
require physical therapy or sur­
gery.
Such cases can usually be diag­
nosed via physical examination by 
a medical professional.

New self-assembly technique can 
help separate biological cells
Popular science and science fiction robots appear at Robot Hall of Fame
NANOPARTICLES, from A7
to touch each other. A balance 
between these repulsive forces 
and the attractive capillary forces 
results in a situation where the 
particles remain at a specific dis­
tance from each other.
“That is how we can make a 
monolayer in which the distance 
between the particles is non-ze­
ro,” Aubry said.
Not only can the precise dis­
tance between the particles be 
calculated, but the distance can 
also be changed by carefully 
manipulating the forces acting on 
the particles.
The applications of this new 
technique are numerous.
“The fact that we can control
the gap between the particles 
means that we can also control 
the mass transfer of gas or liquid 
or other particles in the direction 
normal to the interface,” Aubry 
said.
This property makes such 
materials extremely useful in 
drug delivery, the process of 
delivering pharmaceuticals to 
humans. Patches through which 
the medicines are delivered can 
be manufactured using materials 
like these.
By controlling the distances 
between the particles, the speed 
at which drugs are delivered can 
be controlled.
Another application is in the 
field of optics. “[This technique] 
could be useful for making pho-
tonic materials. These are materi­
als where the distance between 
the particles is comparable to the 
wavelength of light. So, you can 
manipulate light using these pho­
tonic materials,” Singh said.
Although the development 
of this technique is a remark­
able feat, the researchers intend 
to delve deeper into their area 
of study. Aubry mentioned that 
future projects include manipu­
lating different kinds of particles 
like drops, biological cells, and 
particles with different shapes or 
sharp edges.
Aubry and Singh are also trying 
to use this technique to separate 
clustered biological cells, so that 
they can be viewed more easily 
and efficiently.

Todd Jochem, a Ph.D. gradu­
ate of Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics 
Institute, spoke on behalf of 
NavLab 5, an autonomous 
minivan developed at the Robotics 
Institute.
Jochem started working with 
robots in 1990 at Carnegie Mellon, 
working for Chuck Thorpe in the 
NavLab group. Jochem, who later
founded Applied Perception Inc., 
was one of two students who rode 
in NavLab in 1995’s “No Hands 
Across America” tour, on which 
NavLab 5 steered itself on public 
highways across the country.
Applied Perception Inc., which 
focused on the perception, plan­
ning, and control technologies for 
unmanned vehicles, was bought 
last year by Foster-Miller, the larg­
est supplier of military robots. 
Jochem is currently the group 
director of Foster-Miller.
Jochem said that his work 
in the robot industry currently 
revolves around “making robots 
smarter and more useful.” One 
of the industry's newest develop­
ments allows robots to help bat­
tlefield medics find and extract 
wounded soldiers. As of now, the 
robots have not been tested on an 
actual battlefield but “the ideas it 
has spawned will eventually help 
save fives,” said Jochem.
This year’s event, held at the 
Carnegie Science Center on 
April 9, was a red-carpet affair. 
As guests walked in, they were 
greeted by paparazzi, strobe 
lights, and soundtracks from Star 
Wars, Star Trek, and the like. The 
Entertainment Technology Center 
helped to pull of some of the glitz
and glamour.
The interior of the Carnegie 
Science Center was decorated 
with robots and “I ‘heart’ robot” 
balloons. The guests mingled 
among the robots, scientists, 
researchers, friends, family, and 
robot enthusiasts.
Actor Anthony Daniels, who 
played C-3PO in all six Star Wars 
movies, was the master of cer­
emonies, as he has been since the 
start of the Robot Hall of Fame. 
He delighted the audience with 
his anecdotes and his enthusiastic 
personality.
Roboworld, a permanent robot­
ics exhibit that will include the 
Robot Hall of Fame, is scheduled 
to open in the science center next 
spring. According to a Carnegie 
Science Center press release, 
the exhibition reportedly costs 
$3.4 million and will occupy a 
6000-square-foot exhibit area on 
the second floor.
The Robotics Institute and the 
Entertainment Technology Center 
have also helped in the design and 
construction of the robotics exhib­
it, which will feature more than 
30 hands-on, interactive exhibit 
stations focusing on robotic sens­
ing, thinking, and acting.

Papadimitriou, an interna­
tionally acclaimed theorist of 
algorithms, received this year’s 
Katayanagi Prize for Research 
Excellence, while Demaine 
walked away with the Katayanagi 
Emerging Leadership Prize in 
light of his extensive research in 
computational origami.
The awards ceremony took 
place Thursday in Wean Hall 
7500 before a packed house of 
computer scientists, researchers, 
professors, and students.
TUT President Hideo Aiso 
said, “I am proud of this remark­
able contribution that Christos 
Papadimitriou and Erik Demaine 
have made to high level education 
in computer science.”
In his speech, Papadimitriou 
emphasized the importance of 
mathematics in scientific disci­
plines like physics, biology, and 
ch imistry.
The deepest and most funda­
mental problem [in science] is 
computation,” Papadimitriou 
said.
He also shared how the com­
putational perspective, when 
applied to various sciences, pro­
vides new insight into different 
areas of research. For example, 
life sciences such as biology can 
be approached in terms of algo­
rithms.
The algorithmic view is chang­
ing the sciences: mathematical, 
natural, fife, and social. Computer 
science is placing itself at the 
center of scientific discourse and 
exchange of ideas,” he said.
Papadimitriou, who has taught
at some of the country’s most pres­
tigious schools, such as Harvard, 
MIT, and Stanford, specializes in 
analyzing and developing theo­
ries of algorithms and complexity. 
He uses his research in part to 
explore these theories’ applica­
tions to databases, optimization, 
game theory, and natural science.
According to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, Papadimitriou has 
authored five books, including a 
work of fiction, Turing — A Novel 
about Computation, which brings 
together love, history, and compu­
tational science in a unique amal­
gamation.
Sharing Papadimitriou’s pas­
sion for algorithmic functions, 
Demaine took over the podium 
with his presentation, titled 
“Origami, Linkages, Polyhedra: 
Folding with Algorithms.”
Demaine’s work focuses on 
computational origami, the math­
ematical aspect of the centuries- 
old Japanese tradition of paper 
folding.
“[I want] to be able to answer 
questions that arise in science, 
engineering, and art reconfigura­
tion. Folding is everywhere: in 
mechanics, robotics, graphics, 
and biology,” Demaine said.
Demaine said that origami, 
once thought to be relatively 
simple, can now be approached 
through computational geometry.
Different forms of origami can 
be constructed by algorithms. Any 
2-D or 3-D shape can be fold­
ed from a single square sheet of 
paper by measuring the required 
coordinates, then simulating and 
deriving the numerical data com­
putationally.
This dynamic process can help 
computer scientists understand 
the procedure of folding and tack­
le the problems associated with 
it.
Also, according to Demaine, 
using a mix of discrete math, 
geometry, algorithms, equations, 
and graphs, even complex pro­
cesses, like DNA folding and the 
configuration of deployable struc­
tures, can be enhanced.
“By solving folding prob­
lems, we may build reconfigu- 
rable robots from movies like 
Transformers or Terminator 3, 
hinging together a collection of 
pieces that reconfigure into arbi­
trary shapes,” Demaine said.
Technical origami has become 
more popular in recent years due 
to a growing understanding of its 
mathematical and computational 
aspects, Demaine explained.
“We understand the math of 
building origami bases,” Demaine 
said. “The algorithmic way of 
thinking makes more diverse 
forms of origami possible.”
A collection of Demaine’s art­
work is currently on display in an 
exhibit titled Design and the Elastic 
Mind at the Museum of Modem 
Art in New York City. During his 
presentation, Demaine walked his 
audience through the creations of 
physicist Robert Lang, a student 
of origami for over 30 years.
“I have never seen anything like 
Demaine’s research in Japan,” 
Aiso said. He also added that 
Demaine’s highly praised work in 
origami provides a new perspec­
tive to the Japanese culture of ori­
gami through computer science.
“I hope these prizes will grow in 
significance and size, and strength­
en the partnership between TUT 
and Carnegie Mellon,” Aiso said.
Dean Randal E. Bryant, along 
with many other distinguished 
members of the School of 
Computer Science, was also pres­
ent at the awards ceremony. The 
award winners will present their 
work at TUT on May 23.

Lizzee Solomon/Art EditorBack to basics: Over-marketed coffee
Coffee shops have a lot going for 
them, not the least of which is the charm 
of their understated simplicity — after 
all, people just want coffee. Given that, 
it’s easy to pinpoint the beginning of 
Starbucks’ struggle as the time when the 
company’s focus changed from coffee to 
coffee and all its possible accoutrements.
ast week, Starbucks announced its 
latest strategy for upping the ante within 
its market — not other coffee shops, but 
M Donald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts, the 
low-cost competition. The strategy: a 
return to the basics, with an “everyday” 
blend, the new Pike Place Roast. The 
PP Roast comes in response to regulars’ 
complaints that they never know what 
the coffee will taste like, since the ’Bucks 
changes it up every day. Now, this signa­
ture blend will be offered daily as a way 
to isure consistency in flavor.
And along with the new blend, Star­
bucks had a new (albeit very temporary) 
strategy for showcasing the PP Roast. 
In a display of incredible wastefulness, 
Starbucks instructed its baristas to toss 
any brew more than 30 minutes old. 
Last Tuesday, an msnbc.com article 
quoted Starbucks Chairman/CEO How­
ard Schultz as saying, “We’ll be pour­
ing out more coffee than most people 
serve.” In a world that’s quickly going 
green, it’s hard to believe that such a 
strategy made it to the table, let alone 
into practice. Such smug wastefulness 
also greatly contradicts the “back to 
basics” concept supposedly associated 
with the PP Roast.
Starbucks is being so smart, it’s being 
dumb. The over-marketing is unappeal­
ing — the wasted brew and the “back-to- 
basics” gimmicks are being sold to the cus­
tomers the same way Starbucks tries to sell 
the idea of a Skinny Latte, a pointless exer­
cise in simplification that fails, because it’s 
just as easy to say, “Give me a.skim latte,” as 
it is to say, “Give me a Skinny Latte.”
In the end, Starbucks is just selling yet 
another image. The kicker is that goiag 
back to basics could be as easy as a focus 
on good coffee and good prices, without 
the special effects. Throwing out coffee 
every 30 minutes isn’t basic, it’s stupid. 
Come on, Starbucks.
Editorial Dissent
Small coffeeshops that avoid the pre­
tensions of hipster-dom reign supreme 
over Starbucks in coffee quality and 
atmosphere. That said, Starbucks can 
keep messing up — it just helps the 
small guys.Choreographing diversity is common, wrong
I In] an article printed last Monday, 
“IV helle Obama speaks at presiden­
tial rally in Skibo Gym,” The Tartan 
dis issed Michelle Obama’s visit to our 
ca pus and the questionable acts that 
foi l wed on the part of those coordinat­
ing he event.
The Tartan’s reporting of these state- 
mei ts was devised neither as an attack 
on arack Obama’s campaign nor as a 
sensationalized or inflammatory article. 
The statements made by these event co­
ordinators — who, as it is now known, 
were volunteers rather than part of Mi­
chelle Obama’s team — were reported 
not to cause controversy, but because 
Carnegie Mellon students seemed genu­
inely shocked, and as such, it is the jour­
nalistic responsibility of The Tartan to 
report them. The issue at hand is that 
the aforementioned statements sur­
prised the students in the audience for 
Michelle Obama’s speech, which took 
place on a campus known for its (albeit 
insular) diversity.
It is commonly known that the major­
ity of political candidates perform such
acts of crowd organizing to counterbal­
ance stereotypes associated with that 
candidate and portray that candidate 
in the best light possible. John McCain’s 
event organizers have been accused of 
beefing up the crowd of young people 
behind the Senator. Hillary Clinton’s or­
ganizers have similarly made the news 
for incorporating middle-aged men and 
a younger Hispanic population to indi­
cate that she, too, has a diverse group 
of supporters. The event coordinators 
at Mrs. Obama’s speech/ollowed in this 
vein.
However, in this case, the language 
used by the event coordinators was 
surprisingly politically incorrect in its 
bluntness and lack of sensitivity. While 
we on the board find it disappoint­
ing that we, as a nation, are so used to 
inorganic campaign strategizing, we 
were less offended by the volunteer co­
ordinators’ actions than the way they 
went about them. If choreographed 
diversity is a part of the campaign pro­
cess, it should at least be done in a more 
diplomatic and less offensively blatant
manner.
When reports of choreographed 
audiences surface in the news, read­
ers most often answer with a shrug, as 
the technique has become increasingly 
common, and even expected, in politi­
cal events. Still, it is important that we 
not become so used to this tactic that we 
begin to ignore its manipulative nature.
On a campus worth celebrating for its 
great racial and ethnic diversity among 
an intelligent, well-informed group of 
young voters, we as a student popula­
tion are surprised at the need to alter 
the face of our student body. We do not 
think this event should be held against 
the campaign of Barack Obama. This is 
not an issue of Hillary versus Barack, or 
even of Republican candidate John Mc­
Cain against either Democratic presi­
dential hopeful. Rather, this is an issue 
of the character of political campaigns 
in our country today, and of the need for 
political correctness — or, even better, 
non-discriminatory campaign proce­
dures — that serve not to alienate, but 
unite young voters.Elections — over on the first try
While the passing of another cycle 
of student government elections rarely 
mer :s an article on the process itself, 
we want to congratulate student gov­
ern ent, and specifically the Elections 
Board, for making this year’s elections a 
process worth being involved in.
With advertising materials stocked 
with puzzle pieces and plaid, technol­
ogy-enabled student debates, and a new 
voting system that has alleviated the
issues of last spring (and fall), we have 
seen a greatly reformed elections op­
eration in 2008. The student body has 
noticed as well, resulting in nearly 1800 
votes and an election that was ratified 
by undergraduate Student Senate and 
the Graduate Student Assembly the first 
time around.
After last year’s extended period of 
system failures, eligibility issues, and 
general indecision, this year’s election
process’s simplicity has become notable.
As the timely election will allow for 
more work to get done under their terms 
in office, we also congratulate the Elec­
tions Board for executing the elections 
without issues. So with an election done 
right we congratulate Jared and Pooja, 
as well as Evan, and wish them all en­
joyable and productive terms as they 
take office this year not in autumn, but 
in April.

As the critical Pennsylvania Demo­
cratic primary draws ever closer, the 
Obama-versus-Clinton drama is reach­
ing its boiling point. Hordes of college 
students across the state and the coun­
try have pledged their support for Ba­
rack Obama, while a large majority of 
senior citizens have signed on to sup­
port Hillary Clinton.
Obama claims that his campaign 
is all about change. He continues to 
bombard us with idealistic propaganda 
about how he will achieve health care 
reform, border security, international 
peace, and a strong economy — all at 
once. This hopeful rhetoric is appealing 
to a younger generation, like that which 
includes you and me. But rather than 
truly being a rhetoric of hope, Obama’s 
words are just part of a political ploy, 
and young people are easy targets be­
cause their minds and hearts are filled 
with enthusiasm and positive thoughts 
for the future.
Clinton, on the other hand, continues 
to rant and rave about her experience in 
the White House and Senate, her knowl­
edge of politics, and her understanding 
of complex situations; the list is endless. 
Seeing that older people are generally 
more resistant to change, all Clinton is 
doing is disagreeing with Obama’s hope­
ful rhetoric to secure a bunch of votes. In 
fact, according to NBC exit polls in early 
March, she has 59 percent of the votes 
in the over-60 category and 53 percent 
of the votes in the 45-59 category.
Obama understands how young peo­
ple think, and he exploits this knowledge 
to his advantage. Rather than being 
about the voters themselves, he recog­
nizes that the younger generation has 
great unused political potential, and is 
finding a way to channel it for his own 
benefit. He’s not doing anything wrong, 
though — he’s simply playing the politi­
cal game. In fact, it’s our own fault for 
not recognizing Obama’s false promises
and hollow speeches. In mid-March, an 
analyst for NBC news reported that 57 
percent of people younger than 29 and 
54 percent of people in the 30-44 cat­
egory prefer Obama.
Clinton plays with politics in the 
same way. During the televised Demo­
cratic debates, she discussed her pro­
posed policies as a means of reclaiming 
America for the people and fixing the 
problems created by Bush’s Republi­
can era — basically nothing original. 
To combat Obama’s statement that 
he would try to talk to Cuba and Iran, 
Clinton threw a fit about how America 
never negotiates with leaders that com­
mit atrocities against their own people. 
Certainly, such a nostalgic approach 
resonated with senior citizens who still 
have a great sense of patriotism fueled 
by World War II and, later, Vietnam. 
On the other hand, Obama has visited 
a lot of college campuses and has been 
seen in various newspapers talking to 
students. This approach has made him 
popular among younger voters.
It is time for our generation—and the 
general public — to realize that modern 
politicians are concerned more with 
power than policy, and that — irrespec­
tive of race, gender, or social background 
— they will do almost anything to get 
votes. But, if tomorrow, lobbyists are 
in vogue and all of the college students 
look up to them, it will take less than a 
second for Obama to switch allegiances 
and claim that lobbyists are central to 
the process of freedom and democracy 
and everything else he would control 
if elected president. Clinton could pull 
off something similar and stop her visits 
to Kosovo and African nations just be­
cause her support base does not value 
humanitarian visits any more.
The old and young population divi­
sion of Clinton-versus-Obama has been 
exacerbated by the media, which fails 
to tell the common citizens that they 
are being exploited as a pawn in the cre­
ation of a political order that is neither 
representative of nor for the people.

LetterToTheEditor
Barack Obama will bring about tangible change
While reading Tarun Bhan’s April 7 
SayWhat? column, “Look past Obama’s 
rhetoric of ‘change,’” I was reminded 
why I have stopped following cable 
news channels and political analysts for 
any substantial information regarding 
presidential campaign issues. In order 
to convey the complexity of the issues in 
15-second soundbytes, the pundits have 
stereotyped each of the candidates such 
that they fit into neatly drawn boxes. Ac­
cording to the media, Clinton is the pol­
icy wonk, McCain is the maverick, and 
Obama is the inexperienced dreamer. 
Unfortunately, this has propagated 
misinformed arguments, such as that 
Obama lacks political experience and 
that his talk of change is just rhetoric.
When Barack Obama talks about 
change, what he means is changing 
the way government is run. Obama 
believes that the government should 
be accountable to all of its citizens, not 
just white people or black people or rich 
people or poor people, but to everyone. 
The change he calls for means leveling 
the playing field so that we all have a 
chance to achieve the American Dream. 
The change he calls for means helping 
students who have to pay astronomi­
cal tuition rates by offering tax cuts in 
exchange for public service and raising 
the caps on federal loans and grants. 
The change he calls for means having a 
responsible health care plan that is not 
written by insurance companies that 
forces citizens to buy health care even 
if they cannot afford it, but rather a plan 
that is affordable to all and offers com­
prehensive benefits. This is not rhetoric. 
This is change we can believe in.
The charge that Obama lacks experi­
ence is just as ridiculous as calling his 
call for change empty rhetoric. During 
Barack Obama’s tenure as a U.S. sena­
tor, he has sponsored and passed major 
bipartisan legislation, such as the Co- 
burn-Obama Transparency Bill, which 
creates a publicly searchable website 
that tracks the $1 trillion in earmarks, 
contracts, and federal grants, as well 
as the Lugar-Obama Non-Proliferation 
Initiative, which seeks to reduce surplus 
stockpiles of conventional weapons.
At a time in our country’s history 
when we have so many challenges fac­
ing us — the economy, the war in Iraq, 
health care — we need a leader capable 
of uniting the country. If we are to have 
a national dialogue on the issues that 
affect us all, we need a president who is 
willing to level with and be accountable 
to the people. This is what I believe Ba­
rack Obama brings to the table and that 
is why I will vote for him on April 22.
I urge you all to look past the rheto­
ric clouding the media and to take some 
time to actually read the candidates’ 
platforms and see their plans for your­
self. If we rely on the pundits to make 
the call for us, then we will continue to 
repeat unquestioningly what they have 
to say and will remain misinformed.

Judging by the books
fillipfl/W'
THEAARN nRv
I remember when my friend 
Dan first told me he loved Kurt 
Vonnegut, one of my favorite au­
thors — ever. He quoted a passage 
from Cat’s Cradle, and I was sure 
we were soul mates. (We liked the 
same books; how couldn’t we be 
destined to be together?) In my 
mind’s eye, I could see us walking 
through Dresden and stopping 
by for some bokamaru, eternally 
united by Vonnegut’s literature.
As superficial as it may sound, 
I’m not the only one to judge peo­
ple based on their reading prefer­
ences. According to a recent ar­
ticle in The New York Times, many 
people judge others and them­
selves based on their collections 
of favorite books. And, thanks 
to growing networking sites, it’s 
now easier to do so than ever.
With Facebook, we’re never more 
than one dick away from find­
ing out who else is obsessed with 
The Catcher in the Rye — or Goose- 
bumps. Many a late-night Facebook 
stalker has looked at a friend’s fa­
vorite books on his or her profile 
to judge how well-read that person 
is. listing The Da Vinci Code, for 
example, reads “poser,” while list­
ing works by Voltaire or Baudelaire 
reads “pseudo-intellectual.”
Books are an easy way to evalu­
ate someone’s personality. Lit­
erary interests can reveal one’s 
inclinations in politics, religion, 
and lifestyle. Online or in real
life, having a literary common­
ality brings two people closer. 
I myself have started conver­
sations at parties comparing 
book tastes, and consider my­
self a refined first-hand analyst 
of how to judge someone based 
on his or her favorite books.
When it comes to dating, 
book choices can even be deal- 
breakers. People often hold 
their breaths before revealing 
their top choices: If a book is 
too academic or literary, you’re 
deemed a fake; too low and 
you’re considered a fool.
This is true of Carnegie Mel­
lon as well. A friend of mine 
recently commented to me, 
“Sharing favorite books doesn’t 
necessarily mean you’re com­
patible, but it sparks a conver­
sation. It’s this shared liking 
that may lead to another date.”
Immediately judging some­
one based on literary tastes can 
be limiting, but in the cut-throat 
worlds of dating and online net­
working sites, a little judgment 
can go a long way.
Perhaps it is as Vonnegut 
says: We create “granfaloons,” 
or groups who claim to have a 
shared identity when their mu­
tual associations are actually 
meaningless. But doing so isn’t 
necessarily bad. Why not go on a 
date with someone who’s shared 
the same journey of books? You 
already shared those few hun­
dred pages, why not a night out?
Phyllis Kim (phyllisk@J hopes 
Vonnegut will come in handy 
during her six years at school.
Religion is not an independent entity
mAAma lseoneNnR
In a March 30 article in the Vat­
ican’s newspaper, L’Osservatore 
Romano, Monsignor Vittorio For- 
menti stated that Catholicism is 
no longer the dominant religion 
in the world, and that this posi­
tion is instead now held by Mus­
lims. The projected number of 
Catholics is approximately 1.13 
billion people, which, although 
by no means insignificant, falls 
short of the estimated 1.3 billion 
Muslims around the world.
Initially, I had to wonder about 
the potential bias present in this 
information, and, if the report 
was true, what the repercussions 
would be for world religion in the 
21st century.
While this information was 
initially surprising, it became in­
creasing less so as I thought about 
the data. My surprise was rooted 
in the fact that Catholicism is 
seemingly everywhere. The con­
stant presence of the papacy in 
world news, the monumental 
cathedrals found in major cities, 
and the large number of Catho­
lic groups I have encountered 
in both high school and college 
have together convinced me of 
the permanent nature and seem­
ing dominance of the Catholic re­
ligion. In reality, however, such 
monuments are merely symbols 
of a cultural group that depends 
on something far less conspicu­
ous than its ornate cathedrals,
but far more important in the 
long run: its followers. In this re­
gard, it appears that the largely 
Eastern setting in which Islam is 
being taught has played a major 
role in its increasing dominance.
The outspokenness of the 
Vatican on this change in the field 
of religious dominance seems 
to be reflective of two things. 
First, this is not a shift which 
will immediately be reversed, 
but rather is a developing pattern 
that could continue for several 
decades. Second, this shift is of a 
large enough magnitude to spark 
unrest and force the Vatican to 
find ways to call out to and re­
store the followers that it seems 
to have lost.
So why does this growing gap 
between the number of Muslims 
and Catholics exist? Accord­
ing to the article, Formenti says 
Muslim families are increasingly 
larger than Christian ones, which 
is a driving force behind Islam’s 
growing world presence. In an 
interview with NBC, the monsi­
gnor said that it “is true that while 
Muslim families, as is well known, 
continue to make a lot of children, 
Christian ones on the contrary 
tend to have fewer and fewer.”
Islam’s presence is primarily 
found in Eastern societies. Ac­
cording to www.islamicweb.com, 
close to 88 percent of the world’s 
Muslim population resides in 
Asia and Africa. In contrast, a re­
port by BBC News estimates that 
the majority of the world’s Catho­
lics resides in the Americas and 
Europe.
Generally speaking, these
Western societies have a 
faster-paced and more technol- 
ogy-oriented framework than 
the Muslim-dominated Eastern 
societies do. Religion by nature 
is designed to be a reflective 
and lifelong journey, and can 
often demand more time than 
those of us constantly on the 
run are willing to give. While 
one could argue that it’s no 
more time-consuming than the 
scientific endeavors that cur­
rently appear to dominate our 
time, it is also undeniably true 
that the questions provoked 
by religion rarely provide the 
definite and immediately rele­
vant answers offered by scien­
tific studies. In contrast, East­
ern cultures typically revolve 
around a slower pace of life, 
which is more conducive to re­

heritage of large families, then, 
is simply a magnification of the 
religiously favorable environ­
ment the surrounding culture 
creates.
It is important to realize that 
religion is not an independent

of a society’s overarching struc­

or the relations between dif­
ferent schools of thought are 
to be significantly improved, 
alterations in the fundamental 
aspects of the cultures them­
selves must first be made.

iEalHRr Tmat
Think about this: Michelle 
Kwan, 2016.
2016 is not the cost of a Vera 
Wang dress Kwan skates in (that 
would be more); nor is it the year 
America’s ice queen should once 
again vie for her elusive Olympic 
gold. (It’s is a Summer Olympic 
year anyway.) 2016 is the first 
eleci on year in which Michelle 
Kwai will be at least 35 years old
— ai d thus eligible for the presi­
dent of the United States.
I mst say, I wholeheartedly 
support a Kwan candidacy, as 
spec i lative as it may seem, eight 
years into the future.
Sure, the prospect of a figure 
skating star running for or becom­
ing president seems oudandish. 
But why? In the fight-to-the-death 
battle in politics that is going 
on today, Kwan’s charisma — as 
opposed to the bureaucracy in 
place now — could be the so- 
called “change” our country 
needs. Beauty knows no partisan­
ship; art unites, not divides.
Kwan has been building up her 
political experience since she left 
the competitive skating circuit in 
2006. In the fall of that year, she 
transferred to the University of 
Denver to major in political sci­
ence and pursue a minor in inter­
national studies, both of which 
she is well equipped for. Kwan’s 
skating career has only furthered 
her education. For international 
studies, Kwan has trotted — or 
rather, glided — all over the 
globe. And concerning political 
science, the entire world of skat­
ing is one giant lesson in politics. 
You name it, it’s got it — the
politics of coaches, the politics 
of judges, the politics of how to 
wear one’s hair. It’s a tough world 
out there, but Kwan is clearly 
ready to handle it.
Additionally, in November of 
2006, Michelle Kwan was named 
a Public Diplomacy Ambassador 
by Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice. In this position, Kwan has 
traveled abroad to encourage 
cross-cultural dialogue and to 
inspire young people to pursue 
sports. She has since journeyed 
to China, Russia, and Argentina 
to hold skating clinics and talk 
to athletes, coaches, youth, and 
entrepreneurs. (From what I’ve 
heard, she’s even a tad better at 
public speaking than Dubya, but 
we’ll give dear Dubya the benefit 
of the doubt, since it was unlikely 
Kwan had to use the word 
“nuclear” in her cross-cultural dis­
cussions — and therefore was not 
subject to his erroneous pronun­
ciation of “nu-cu-lar.”)
Many may remember fellow 
skater Sasha Cohen’s stint at the 
opening ceremonies of the 2002 
Salt Lake City Games, when she 
handed her cell phone to President 
Bush in a “Mom, I’m sitting next 
to the President!” moment, but 
Kwan’s political handlings go 
deeper. At the 1998 post-Olympic 
reception at the White House, 
for example, Kwan was chosen 
by her teammates to present to 
then-President Bill Clinton a com­
memorative Team USA jacket.
Who would be Kwan’s running 
partner? Hopefully, she would 
choose her longtime mentor and 
coach, Frank Carroll. Carroll’s 
rinkside manner is almost 
Reagan-esque: a little bit dap­
per, a little bit cuddly, an overall 
lovable figure. Plus, he has been 
there through thick and thin in 
Kwan’s career and is prominent
in the world of figure skating.
Moreover, the Kwan campaign 
has a better idea for a campaign 
activity. A posh hotel banquet 
room can only hold so many 
citizens. Wouldn’t it make more 
sense to have a Kwan fundrais­
ing skate-a-thon, where the star 
would perform in front of tens of 
thousands of people?
In this vein, Kwan will enter­
tain her way through her presi­
dency. Elton John concert? 
Please. Kwan will do her own 
performing. Though Hillary’s 
recent fundraiser with Rocket 
Man himself on April 9 at Radio
City Music Hall built up some 
good press (as well as an influx 
of much-needed campaign cash), 
Hill herself did not sing. If elected 
president, Kwan will skate, and 
audiences will swoon, as always.
Furthermore, Kwan won’t have 
to worry about the demographics 
of her voters. As Hillary has the 
rural votes and the older votes 
and Barack has the youth vote, 
they’re dueling over several 
demographic groups. Kwan’s got 
everyone. With figure skating 
dream Michelle Kwan as presi­
dent, voters will not be broken 
down into dueling categories, but
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
will instead join hands and sing 
“Kumbaya” — ’60s style. Kwan’s 
charisma is that uniting.
With all the technicalities of 
a Kwan campaign in place, the 
election could be a credible run 
in 2016. My only concern is the 
whole “3 a.m. phone call” situa­
tion. Sorry, economic vampires
— Kwan can’t stay up all night. 
She has to get up early in the 
morning to train.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@J is 
looking forward to the day that 
Michelle Kwan installs a skating 
rink in the White House.

N,’- s,­-pS6UY k r2­ C’­-
Hey Tartans,
Hopefully you voted last week 
and know that campus elections 
came and went, and with that, 
my term as your student body 
president goes into that lame 
duck phase. What’s nice is that
I don’t have to deal with foreign 
dignitaries who feel like there’s 
no more bite to what I say be­
cause I’m not going to be in office 
for that much longer. On the con­
trary, Adi and my administration 
and other parties are still very 
much open to your suggestions 
as we finish our terms in office.
Hopefully, you were among 
the 1800 people who voted. We 
saw a lot of participation, and 
both the CMUnity and Tartan 
Pride campaigns, along with 
Elections Board, should be cred­
ited with the fantastic turnout. 
As a result of the polling activi­
ties, my successor is Jared It- 
kowitz. In my opinion, he is very 
competent and will make a ter­
rific president. Jared has lots of 
great ideas, and, due to his three 
years of experience in Student 
Senate, he understands how to 
go about implementing them. 
His vice president, Pooja God- 
bole, is equally talented and has 
demonstrated her leadership by 
chairing Mayur SASA’s incred­
ibly successful Bhangra in the 
Burgh event. As with Adi and me, 
Jared and Pooja will need your 
help and suggestions to make 
sure they are on the right track, 
so keep reading this column and 
sending e-mails.
In other news, Senator John 
McCain will be on campus this 
Tuesday. He will speak about the 
current state of the economy and 
outline his plan on how to fix the 
current doldrums we find our­
selves in. As I wrote in an earlier 
Presidential Perspectives col­
umn, I’ve been very inspired by 
all the conversation surrounding 
our national elections this year. 
Certainly, we can credit Senator 
Obama’s campaign for reaching 
out to and catalyzing our genera­
tion. However, in order to really 
participate in Senator Obama’s 
vision of a “post-partisan” poli­
tics, we should educate ourselves 
on what the other candidates 
have to say without paying much 
regard to party lines. We must 
judge each platform with few 
preconceived notions and decide 
what we truly believe is best for 
our country, rather than just lis­
tening to what the media, our 
friends, or other outside influ­
ences try to superficially con­
vince us what is best. We all have 
brains and individual perspec­
tives. We at Carnegie Mellon can 
prove that to ourselves by keep­
ing an open mind, listening to all 
the candidates’ points, and en­
gaging in further conversations 
with our peers, professors, par­
ents, strangers — you name it.
Last week, the student body elected Jared Itkowitz to be its next president. So we asked,A PERSON’S OPINION
If you were elected student body president, what would be the main tenet of your platform?

The Carnegie Mellon club row­
ing team was in Camden County, 
N.J. this past weekend for the 
Knecht Cup, hosted by Villanova 
University. The event is one of 
the most competitive races of the 
year for Carnegie Mellon crew.
Schools travel far and wide 
to attend this event, and even 
Stanford University sent boats 
to this year’s race. A number of 
top rowing schools were in at­
tendance at this year’s race, rep­
resenting some of the best teams 
in the northeast and the nation, 
including the University of Mas­
sachusetts, Fordham University, 
Bucknell University, the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh, Penn State, 
Wisconsin University, Holy Cross 
University, Boston College, and 
University of Connecticut.
Carnegie Mellon brought six 
boats: lightweight men’s and 
women’s fours, a women’s four, a 
women’s pair, and novice men’s 
and women’s fours.
The light men’s four narrowly 
missed qualifying for a final, los­
ing by two seats to the Univer­
sity of Maryland, and the light 
women and novices also raced 
hard but were unable to qualify 
for the finals.
The women’s four, with sopho­
mores Alex Cirillo in stroke seat, 
Alyssa Fogel, Megan Larcom, 
and first-year Emily Anderson, 
and sophomore Tom Lewkowitz 
coxing, posted the second-fastest 
heat time in their event, easily 
making their final on Sunday.
Unfortunately, the team 
caught a crab in the final, and 
dropped from medal contention. 
The women’s pair, with juniors 
Judith Vogel and Natalie Weir,
also made it to the finals. They 
rowed well, taking the silver 
medal behind Villanova.
“This is one of our toughest 
races with the competitors that 
we’re likely to see at nationals in 
May, so it was great to make it to 
finals and scope out the competi­
tion,” Larcom said.
The weather on the Cooper 
River cooperated and offered a 
high level of competition at the 
Knecht Cup, despite mixed re­
sults from the boats.
This Saturday, Carnegie 
Mellon has a home race against 
the University of Pittsburgh and 
Duquesne University set to begin 
at 9 a.m.
The Car-Du-Pitt race is a tra­
dition for the Pittsburgh row­
ing programs and will be held 
on the Allegheny River between 
the 40th Street and 31st Street 
bridges.

Editor’s Note: Compubookie is a 
highly sophisticated betting robot 
that has been predicting Buggy 
results since 1974. He is in no way 
affiliated with the Tartan sports 
staff. We just print this stuff.
Greetings campus community 
and Buggy enthusiasts alike. With 
only a week until the races, I’m 
sure you are all anxious to hear 
the top picks and expert analy­
sis for 2008. Although the lack 
of free rolls in the spring leaves 
me with less to go on, the com­
petitive organizations have once 
again come out rolling fast and 
training hard.
Starting with the women: With 
strong sorority participation for 
several of the top dogs, expect 
to see close competition and per­
haps another chair-throwing inci­
dent at awards as well. Speaking 
of DG, look for its co-op to boost 
KDR A into the top five.
Coming in fourth will be the 
women of SPIRIT A, assuming 
the red tape doesn’t jam up their 
pneumatics too badly. Look for 
PiKA A and Fringe A to finish 
strong, but the trophy will not be 
given back this year. Sorry girls, 
but SDC A will once again be 
too fast not to come out on top. 
The team may just be racing the 
clock.
On to the men: Look for anoth­
er three-horse race this year 
between Fringe, PiKA, and SDC
— but let’s start with some of 
the less impressive organizations. 
Look for Sig Ep to place in the top 
10 this year, but not by rolling 
its new experiment of a buggy. 
Finishing slightly quicker will be 
a fast-rolling buggy of SDC B, 
assuming the A team doesn’t have 
to push the B-team buggy on day 
two. As usual, SPIRIT A will make 
the top 10, but will still be out of
reach of the top five. KDR, if the 
competitors can figure out how to 
use their new wheels, will finish 
under 2:15 — talk to Fringe about 
that one, guys.
Since I have nothing good to say 
about Sig Nu, I’ll just get on to the 
top 5. We will see a good showing 
from the B teams of both PiKA 
and Fringe. Their experience and 
depth will place these teams in 
fourth and fifth, respectively.
Now for the good stuff: Fringe, 
SDC, and PiKA have all proven 
that they can cruise through the 
free roll this year, despite the 
absence of mini-raceday. SDC 
returns to the course with some 
repeat pushers for a change, a 
clear advantage for them. But 
what is that awful rattling noise 
your buggy has been making? 
Look for the men of SDC A to take 
third in this one with a respect­
able sub-2:10 time.
So who takes the cup at the 
end of day two? The men of PiKA 
will come out this year looking 
to break a record set decades ago 
by winning for a seventh con­
secutive year. If that isn’t motiva­
tion to win a race, I don’t know 
what is. Fringe can’t be ruled out, 
however. Coming to the course 
with a team full of Betas and 
pushing the fastest buggy on the 
course, expect a new organization 
record for Fringe. We all saw how 
the football player experiment 
worked out for SDC last year, so, 
sorry Fringe, but this year I have 
to bet on the organization with 
the winning record. Although you 
may prove me wrong, I predict 
another win for PiKA A.
Expect times to be very fast this 
year, not because of the course, 
but because of the competition. 
This year’s race will be a good one 
to watch. That’s all I have for this 
year. Good luck to all the teams.
I’m sure I’ll see you out there.
Don’t expect to see me.

Top tennis players outplay competition
JÜi i'Äi i p,.ww
MATTHEW I, CAMPBELL
Professional tennis in recent 
years has been plagued by a 
phenomenon perhaps unique 
to tennis; players pulling out 
of tournaments. For example, 
after losing in the semifinals 
of Indian Wells (four matches), 
Maria Sharapova decided not 
to play the next week in Miami, 
citing fatigue«
The excuse is probably valid, 
however. Because tournaments 
are scheduled close together, 
yet geographically far apart, 
players are bound to get worn, 
out.
Ranked third in the world, 
Novak Bjokovic had to win six 
matches to win Indian Wells 
in California. He then traveled 
from California to Miami, Fla., 
and despite a few days to recu­
perate, he was bundled out in. 
the first round by a relatively 
unknown giant, Kevin Ander­
son. Mardy Fish, Djokovic's fi­
nal victim at Indian Wells, also
lost in his first match at Miami.
When top players withdraw 
from tournaments, organiz­
ers and sponsors as well as the 
tours (the Association of Ten-. 
nis Professionals for the men 
and the Women’s Tennis Asso­
ciation for the women) — not 
to mention the fans — are left 
watching low-ranked play­
ers battle it out, rendering the 
tournament unimportant. The 
inconsistency of draws hurts 
tennis economically and makes 
it difficult for sponsors and fans 
to commit to tournaments.
The ATP and WTA have taken 
steps to cut down on player 
withdrawals. On the men’s side, 
after the four Grand Slams (the 
II, S,, Australian, and French 
opens, along with. Wimbledon), 
there are nine mandatory tour­
naments, the Masters Series. 
Flayers are fined for skipping 
these tournaments. However, 
the fines don’t deter players 
from not playing, Andy Rod­
dick last year skipped four of 
the nine Masters Series tourna­
ments but is still ranked sixth
— and is still wealthy.
The ATP and WTA are also 
rearranging the schedule of 
tournaments. Idiotically, on the 
men’s side, Indian Wells and 
Miami; Canada and Cincinnati, 
Ohio; and Rome and Hamburg 
—all grueling Masters Series— 
are scheduled without a break 
between the two tournaments, 
making it difficult to win two 
in a row» This makes Roddick’s 
2003 Canada-Ctndnnari dou­
ble (12 matches in 14 days) all 
the more remarkable.
However, even if the ATP and 
WTA do space our their manda­
tory tournaments more evenly 
to rule out exhaustion as an 
excuse, players are still prob * 
ably going to skip tournaments. 
The reason is because top play­
ers wi n enough t hat they don’t 
need to play that often, Maria 
Sharapova, who rarely loses in 
the early rounds of a tourna» 
mem, is ranked fifth, a ranking 
based only on 13 tournaments. 
Top-ranked! Justine Henin only
played 15 tournaments, Num­
ber 10 Daniela Ilantuehova, 
meanwhile, played 24, but 
she's far behind Sharapova and 
Henin in ranking points.
In effect, the top players 
are too good — Sharapova, 
for instance, has won three of 
the four tournaments she has 
played this year. The tour s need 
to accept this fact, and should 
market other players more ef- 
fectivefyinstead,
On the men’s side much 
more so than the women's side, 
there are players who are lesser 
known than Federer, Nadal, 
and Roddick, but are equally 
fun to watch.
These players aren’t inconse­
quential, either, Who beat Na* 
dal at the U.S. Open last year? 
Number five David Ferrer. Who 
beat Roddick in the quarters 
of Wimbledon last year? Num­
ber 10 Richard Gasquet. Who 
trounced NadaJ at the Austra­
lian Open earlier this year? 
Then-unknown Jo »Wilfried
Tsonga, now ranked 13th.

took fourth in the more competi­
tive SOOO-ineter run invitational 
with a lime of 14:43.62.
Referring to the busy- week, 
Anderson said, “It makes it dif­
ficult to recover, and also pre­
vents us from doing intensive 
workouts, but it helps to get you

The Carnegk’ Mellon dub 
baseball team traveled to West 
Virginia University on Saturday 
to challenge the Mountaineers to 
a doubleheader, ton fell shore in 
both games, Ttte Tartans were 
coming off a 9-6 loss against Kent 
State on Thursday and were hop­
ing to ti&cleem themselves this 
weekend, In Thursday’s game, the 
Tartans started oar strong with a 
3-0 lead after three innings, but 
could not sustain their perfor­
mance.
The Tartan's goal for Saturday's 
doubleheader was consistency. 
The team knew Saturday's games 
would be a challenge with sev« 
era! players out due to injuries, 
including senior first baseman" 
Ryan Comes, who was unable to 
travel due to a dislocated shoul­
der. While both teams played well 
at the plate, the I&rrans strug­
gled on the defensive end of both 
Janies,
“We are missing two of our 
starters in senior Ryan Comes 
who had a shoulder separation 
and mil he out for the rest of 
the year, Ryan is one of our best 
and most consistent hitters, as is 
Jim Stedmatt who has shoulder 
problems as well With those two 
out, other players such as Reitb 
Menchin, Mam Young and Yoshi

coach Claudio Reilsono said.
The Hm inning of game one 
set the tone for the rest of the 
day, and It was not. looking good 
for Carnegie Mellon, following 
several defensive mistakes by 
the Tartans, the Mountaineers 
claimed seven unearned mas in 
the first inning, Senior Tim Sandy, 
the starting pitcher for Carnegie 
Mellon, was able to regain his 
composure after the first inning 
and threw we II for t he next three, 
but this was not. enough for the 
Tartans to get back in the game. 
The. Mountaineers earned three 
moye runs off Sandy as well as 
a final run against relief pitcher
junior Jm Spagnda.
The Tartans fared better in 
game two, with first-year Zaeh 
Cohen making the start and 
pitching the entire game. The 
game was evenly matched, 
with the score difference never 
exceeding one run, but in the 
end the Mountaineers edged out 
Carnegie Mellon 5 4,
The Tartans defined up their 
act defensively, with junior t hird 
ftajseman Aaron Mernky leading 
the team with two double plays 
in consecutive innings. After a 
regulation of seven innings., 
the Tartans and Mountaineers 
were tied at four. The game 
went, into extra innings, and the 
Mountaineers rounded home 
plate with two («us to win the 
game in the bottom of the eighth 
inning. The teams were scheduled 
to continue the series with a third 
game on Sunday, but the game

The Carnegie Mellon men's 
lacrosse team concluded its sea­
son with two tough games against 
the Taylor University Trojans and 
the Uri-StMe University Thunder. 
On Saturday, the Tartans played 
their last league game against the 
Trojans in muddy, swamp-like 
conditions. Similar to the rest of 
their season, the Tartans strug­
gled to overcome injuries. With 
only 12 healthy players, Carnegie 
Mellon was left wit h only two sub­
stitutions and was unable to keep 
up with the Trojans, eventually 
losing 9 -2. The loss did not. stop 
the Tartans from making the most 
of the conditions and getting a 
little mud on their uniforms.
On Sunday, the 'Damns played 
their final game against Tri- 
State University Thunder, which 
is a Division ill varsity squad, 
Carnegie Mellon prepared for 
this weekend's games by focusing 
on three key components of the 
transition, faceoffs, and
commimieation on defense
While the varsity Thunder 
team lived tip to its name wit h a 
victory against the Tartans 22- 4, 
Carnegie Mellon was happy with 
the opportunity to play at such a 
high level, “It was a great experi­
ence to see tew a team of that 
caliber plays/ sophomore mid­
fielder Nadir Sidjj said. '"Itiey are 
a young team and it was a good 
challenge for us *
Sunday's game concluded the 
Tartans' season, bringing their 
overall record to l -S. Still, they 
are not disappointed wit h t he sea - 
son and are looking ahead to next 
year, The team is young and a bit 
inexperienced, bur many players 
are happy with, the improvement 
throughout the season.
*We got better every day and 
so many guys have never played 
before, so we are happy with how 
it [the season! ended," Sidi said.
The caches are also already 
focused on next season but admit 
that this was a challenging sea­
son. The pa st two years, Carnegie 
Mellon has been ranked as one
of the top 25 teams in the nation 
and had high, expectations lor the 
2CW~~2008 season.
After a preseason poll, the 
Tartans were ranted in the top 15 
nationally but were unfortunate­
ly weakened by injuries. While 
the losses were frustrating, head 
coach Anthony Stamatopoulos 
could see a benefit in the experi­
ence,
*if. was a challenging situation, 
but 1 tlnnk we had been too suc­
cessful too fast in. the past, and we 
needed to learn how to lose/ he 
said, "it really opened our eyes to 
what it takes to be successful,"
Carnegie Mellon is ready to 
move on to next season, and the 
coaches plan on recruiting nation 
ally at camps, high schools, and 
tournaments, while the players 
will recruit, locally on campus .
“We need to build numbers up 
and get back to where we used to 
be/' StamMopoiilos said.

losing streak. But we really need 
to beat the top 15 to 20 teams, 
so ! wouldn’t say it was really a

the match we really needed,"
Clearfield and the rest of 
the players got their chance to 
take a crack at top teams at the 
GLCA tournament. On Friday, 
after steamrolllng Wabash Col­

Hunt displays Donovan watercolors
Exhibit of 19th-century botanical paintings
The flowers from the United Kingdom’s botanical 
gardens of the 1820s may be relics of the past. 
However, Edward Donovan's watercolors of them 
make his exhibit in the Hunt Institute for Botanical 
Documentation the next best thing.
Donovan, born in Cork, Ireland in 1768, was a 
natural history collector, illustrator for natural history 
publications, and owner of the London Museum and 
Institute of Natural History. His published works 
included natural histories of British birds, plants, 
insects, shells, and fish, as well as the insects of 
China and India.
The Hunt exhibit focuses on Donovan’s fascination 
with plants and flowers and shows his collection of 
watercolors that depicted the exotic flowers of the 
decade, which were all drawn between 1823 and 
1830. The flowers were owned by wealthy estate 
owners, who placed them in their personal gardens. - 
Donovan came from a wealthy family himself, and 
thus ran in the same social circles. The flowers were 
obtained from colonial leaders and explorers from 
locations all around the world, including China,
Chile, Mexico, New Zealand, Nepal, Siberia, and the 
eastern United States. Many of them were sent as 
gifts to the estate owners.
Donovan’s watercolors are delicately depicted, 
each with his initials, E.D., etched in pencil in the 
lower right-hand corner. The careful preservation of 
Donovan’s work makes them look relatively recent,' 
in no way appearing as watercolors done almost 200 
years ago. Although drawn two-dimensionally, the 
flowers look realistic and, at first glance, it is hard to 
tell that they have been painted.
The bottoms of the paintings include not only 
Donovan’s initials, but also a series of hyphenated 
numbers. While at first scholars were not familiar 
with these numbers, they later realized that Donovan 
had documented the Linnaean arrangements (a 
biological classification method) of each of his 
depicted flowers. Some of Donovan’s writings on the 
bottoms of his watercolors even include the names of ¦ 
estate owners from whose gardens the flowers came 
from.
A part of the exhibition puts the open pages of 
Curtis Botanical Magazine side-by-side with some 
of Donovan’s depictions of the same flowers. The 
clerodendrum, for example, looks remarkably similar 
in both representations, which are from the same 
year, 1824.
The flowers in Donovan's paintings include begonias, 
chrysanthemums, azaleas, and a number of unigue 
hybrids that were completely new to the people 
in the United Kingdom, as the plants had only 
previously been known in their native areas.
However, Donovan’s work was part of a larger 
movement of flower identification by amateur 
naturalists and trained botanists worldwide.
The 1820s were a decade of great growth for 
horticultural and scientific societies. Donovan 
himself was a member of two such organizations, 
the Linnaean Society and the Wernerian Natural 
History Society. The largest group of this type, the 
Horticultural Society of London was established 
in 1804 and created its first garden in 1821, a 
botanical garden open to the public. Donovan 
depicted several flowers from this garden, as 
noted by the "H.S.” in the lower right-hand 
corner of many of his watercolors. The wealthy 
estate owners also greatly expande'd their flower 
collections during this time into arboretums, 
greenhouses, gardens, and conservatories.
Donovan’s watercolors were tipped into five 
albums and combined into a book published in 
1830. However, despite the success of Donovan's 
publication, his life worsened soon after the book 
was released.
In 1817, the Napoleonic wars resulted in the 
closing of Donovan’s museum, the London 
Museum and Institute of Natural History, which 
caused an economic depression that severely hit 
Donovan and his family and did not allow him 
enough money to continue his career. Although 
his book remained popular, he had sold 50 percent 
of its rights to his publishers. The publishers took 
advantage of Donovan and kept an even higher 
percentage of the proceeds. Donovan published an 
essay in 1833, pleading for the public's assistance 
and threatening to sue the publishers. However, 
the response to his plea was minimal at best. 
Conseguently, Donovan lived in poverty until 1837 
when he died in London of natural causes. His 
family was left impoverished.
Donovan’s legacy lives on through his many 
watercolors. The works currently on display came 
from Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt’s personal 
collection. Hunt, born in 1882, had a strong affinity 
for plants and gardens from her youth, as well 
as a fascination with rare and old books. Thus, 
Donovan’s botanical book was keen to her interest. 
Hunt’s collection alone contains 709 of his works, 
only some of which are displayed in the exhibit.

Everything you need to know
About cheating and falling out of love
Dear Rachaei,
At what point do you decide that 
your feelings for your significant 
other aren’t going to grow 
into everlasting love, and call 
it quits? I want to like my S.O., 
I really do, but it seems like I 
want to be single in the morning 
and with him in the evening or 
single when everything’s normal 
and with him when something’s 
particularly bad or particularly 
good. What do I DO? Heeelllp 
meee pleeeassse.
—Definitely Dazed Darling
Oh you dazed and confused 
victim, you,
So maybe I’m doing too much with 
all of this alliteration. Nevertheless, 
I think you, my dear, should invest 
in your gut feeling. No matter how 
big your gut is, the feeling that it 
provides is probably the easiest way 
to find out how you really feel about 
a situation. Without thinking about 
repercussions or other people’s 
feelings, think about you.
If I was your gut I’d tell you to break 
it off. Then, I'd demand delicious Girl 
Scout Cookies — because a gut 
has got to do what a gut has got to 
do. If you have to remind yourself to 
like your boo, or convince yourself 
that he’s worthy, then that’s already 
too much work. If you were really 
into him, then you wouldn’t be 
constantly doubting yourself. So 
really, in this situation, maybe you 
should go for the Trefoils and do 
some serious gut-listening, Not only 
will you figure out what to do, but 
you’ll get cookies either way, and 
that can’t be bad.
Get it on!
—Rachael
Dear Rachael,
What do you do when your 
girlfriend cheats on you? Can 
you make it work by cheating on 
her for payback?
—Clearly Confused Codswallop
To another dazed and confused 
victim,
Did you note the sarcasm? If so, 
you’re just one step closer to 
becoming a real man. Okay, so 
that was harsh, but obviously you 
need tough love or something 
like it because you are just acting 
like a child. A child that was never 
hugged.
If you want to work out your 
relationship with your significant 
other, then paying her back by 
cheating on her is probably not the 
smartest thing to do - especially if 
she has any sense. Deny her your 
sex for a while, give her the silent 
treatment, make her realize what a 
sham life would be without you in it. 
If you’re all hotness or she genuinely 
cares and the cheating can be 
explained as confused boredom 
or a drunken mistake, she’ll crawl 
or walk or run or skip back to you. 
And if she doesn’t, well, maybe you 
are better off without her. Or you 
could just talk to her and give her a 
piece of your mind. But you should 
definitely deny her your sex.
Work it out!
—Rachael

A new recipe for mixed beats
DJ Amon Tobin brings music to campus after Carnival
After Thursday’s Spring Carnival Concert featuring the 
The Roots, AB Coffeehouse will keep up the good music by 
rounding out Carnival weekend with the groundbreaking DJ 
Amon Tobin on Sunday at 8 p.m. in McConomy.
Tobin is best known for his distinctive use of sampling and 
sound manipulation. Though Tobin spent years pulling apart 
and remixing vinyl sources, his more recent work features 
sounds of all origins. Tobin distorts everyday sounds beyond 
recognition, then pieces them back together over distinctive 
breakbeats.
Tobin’s influences include (but are by no means limited 
to) kitchen utensils, robotics, animals, motorcycles, and, 
of course, other musicians. The resulting sound is often 
spacious, sometimes frenetic, and never stale, ranging from 
the spooky churchiness of "El Cargo” to the swanky chill of 
"Night Fire."
Although his use of sound inarguably pushes the envelope, 
a statement on Tobin’s personal website makes it clear that 
he doesn’t consider his music avant-garde, just enriched by 
different sounds and technigues. According to his label Ninja 
Tune’s website, the end result of all this sound-play is “still 
pure Amon Tobin, but pushed miles forward in sonics and 
melody due to the depth of source material.”
Ninja Tune was founded by DJs Matt Black and Jon More 
(AKA Coldcut), and signs electronic, nu jazz, and instrumental
and abstract hip-hop artists such as Bus Driver and Kid 
Koala, who made an appearance at Carnegie Mellon last year.
Tobin, a Brazilian ex-pat working out of Montreal, made 
his debut on the electrónica scene in the mid-'90s with 
Adventures in Foam, at the time styling himself Cujo, after the 
famous Stephen King novel.
Ninja Tune records took instant notice of Cujo and signed 
him on in 1996. Tobin has since generated six albums under 
his own name, most recently Foley Room, which came out in 
February of last year.
Tobin’s “Sabotuer," off of Supermodified, gained notoriety as 
the main theme of the blockbuster The Italian Job, starring 
Mark Wahlberg. In recent radio interviews, filmmaker 
Luc Besson has indicated that he might be interested in 
incorporating Tobin's music in the third installment of The 
Transporter series, due out in 2009.
Tobin has also done work on video game music, scoring and 
producing the latest sequel in the Tom Clancy Splinter Cell 
franchise in January 2005.
Opening for Amon Tobin will be local break-core artist 
Xanopticon and down-tempo IDM artist Discuss.
Since 2000, Xanopticon has been touring nationally and 
internationally, mixing fast, cutting beats in psychotic style.

Groundbreaking DJ Amon Tobin.
Nearly every track on the group’s November 2007 EP, The 
Silver Key, is a frantic hybrid of IDM, drum, and bass.
Discuss takes a much different tack, with a slower tempo that 
creates a more relaxed and introverted sound, which has often 
been compared to Scottish duo Boards of Canada. Discuss 
gained local momentum with a self-released, self-titled album 
in late 2006.

The Cavalera brothers’ triumphant return
Also: Kingdom of Sorrow’s debut album mixes popular metal band sounds
There is a certain fire contained in any good metal disc that is 
very hard to fake. Where that fire comes from, whether a true 
misanthropy or just everyday frustration, is something the end 
product reflects. Such an album can be an epic (Metallica's 
...And Justice for All) or short and brutal (Slayer's Reign in 
Blood), but usually, the shorter the better.
So, imagine that you have two brothers who founded a seminal 
thrash band that conquered the metal world, put out albums 
that took rock further into its tribal roots than anyone before 
them, and then didn't speak to each other for over a decade. 
One could guess that, upon reuniting first as brothers, and 
then second as musicians, they would create at least a double 
album of furious metal, loaded with metaphors and solos, all 
bolted down with heavy riffs and thunder drums. In the case of 
the Cavalera brothers, all they needed was 30 minutes.
Max and Iggor Cavalera, for those of you who don't know, 
formed Sepultura in the early '80s in a Brazilian town called 
Belo Horizonte. Belo, about as far from the beaches of Rio as 
your mind can carry you, could be said to mirror the hard, 
industrial, punk edge that formed Sepultura's early sound. 
Maybe a death metal band to begin with, the punk/hardcore 
sound that rounded out later masterpieces like Chaos A.D. 
is definitely the focus of what has become, for now anyway, 
the much longed-for Cavalera reunion and the brothers' new 
album, Inflikted.
Before the album came the two brothers’ reunion. After not 
speaking since their fallout in '96, Iggor picked up the phone 
and began the process of reuniting his family. Max, in turn,
suggested that Iggor come to Phoenix, where he is now 
based. What followed, naturally, was a jam session that took 
them back to being two kids, brothers united in their love for 
aggressive music. Naming their album Inflikted, the Cavalera 
Conspiracy is more a gang than a band. Cliché as it seems, 
there is no better way to describe the two brothers.
The energy that spills out from the title track and opener is 
reminiscent of Sepultura’s "Arise,” but the sound is raw and 
the attitude is definitely “us against them.” Choosing Marc 
Rizzo on guitar was the right choice here. Not only a huge 
Sepultura fan, Rizzo also plays with Max in his post-Sepultura 
outfit Soulfly and has a built-in chemistry with Max 
that naturally carries over to Iggor's drumming.
And may I say that Iggor is a beast on the drums. His thunder 
on the next track, "Sanctuary,” makes me want to get a blue, 
green, yellow, and white Camaro and blast this track over and 
over again. It alone is worth the price of the album, standing 
out as the first new direction in thrash metal I have heard 
in years. “Sanctuary" really isn't comparable to other work 
I've heard before — it has awesome soloing from Rizzo, deep 
bass drum, looping riffs, all the requisite fast growls that 
have become Max's trademark vocal style. The way they 
have arranged it all, though, makes it sound new. That style 
evolves further in “Ultra-Violent,” with a double-bass attack 
from Iggor that brings tears to my eyes. Matching up perfectly 
with guest-bassist Rex (Pantera, Down), the track becomes the 
perfect soundtrack to your own apocalyptic visions.
Lyrically, the album is violent, and it works perfectly. Beneath
the violence, the desire to witness the fall of Babylon, as Max 
growls, is a sense that the brothers are united in their attack on 
the rest of us.
One other recent album that has caught my ear is Sludge, 
the debut from Kingdom of Sorrow, or “Crowbreed” as fans 
of Hatebreed and Crowbar call them. Mixing hardcore with 
metal may seem like a strange idea at first, but it works well. 
Take one part doom a la Black Sabbath, one part mid-'90s 
metal-hardcore, two vocalists that are surprisingly alike, and 
voilal Relapse Records were kind enough to unleash this 
upon the masses, and the album has been received well. The 
force of hardcore, with all the karate kids in the pit, is in its 
fast delivery. Sludge, with its drawn out solos, is best enjoyed 
slowly, like whiskey. Jamey Jasta and Kirk Windstein, frontmen 
for Hatebreed and Crowbar, respectively, trade vocals on their 
new album effortlessly, with the closing track “Buried in Black” 
as the highlight. With Hatebreed, the subject matter is usually 
of the pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps variety. Crowbar is 
just heavy. The combination here works, but definitely veers 
into heavy emotional territory. It is definitely more like Crowbar 
(maybe even Down) with more hardcore vocals. It may lay 
the foundation for yet another sub-genre of metal, or be a cult 
classic in the years to come. In any case, it's a great disc for 
long, rainy drives.

Belcea Quartet plays in “Bridges” seriesradio stationOn vegetables
The New Hazlett Theater on the North Side of 
Pittsburgh has a new boarder — chamber music. 
Beginning this season, chamber music arrived at the 
New Hazlett with the Pittsburgh Chamber Music 
Society’s four-concert series, ''Bridges."
The Bridges concert last Monday night featured the 
young Belcea Quartet, from London’s Royal College 
of Music. The group treated the audience to Haydn’s 
Quartet No. 27 and Benjamin Britten’s second and third 
quartets, pieces with which the players are intimately 
familiar and recorded for EMI Music.
In 1996, the musicians worked on the quartets with 
members of the venerable Amadeus Quartet, the group 
the ailing Britten chose to premiere his third quartet — 
and final major work — in 1975.
Violinist Laura Samuel reflected on working with the 
group, writing in the program notes, “It was a meeting 
that had a profound effect on us all both musically and 
personally. Their meticulous attention to detail and 
genuine affection for the music was infectious.”
It was evident that the elderly members of the Amadeus 
Quartet had instilled their affection in the young 
musicians of the Belcea Quartet, whose affinity for 
Britten’s music was on full display at the New Hazlett 
Monday night.
The Belcea Quartet allowed Britten’s deliberately 
constructed third quartet to unfold and speak for itself. 
Actors as well as musicians, the quartet members 
leaned toward or away from each other to give visual 
cues to the music. At the beginning of the piece, the 
second violinist and violist glared at each other as they 
played their dysfunctional parts with jagged rhythms 
and overlapping pitches.
The Hazlett proved to be a perfect venue for chamber

British musical group, performed

Society's four-concert series,

music, preferable to Carnegie Music Hall, which is 
often too large for string quartets. The Belcea musicians 
didn’t have to overplay and sacrifice nuance for volume, 
which served the Haydn well. Monday night, the 
audience, the first row of which was nearly level with 
the performers and only a few feet away, could hear 
every whisper, articulation, and trailing off, and see 
every movement of the fingers as the musicians played.
In the sparse third movement of the third quartet, 
the first violin’s extended soliloquy, accompanied by 
only one person playing long, sustained notes, the 
bow moving at about a centimeter per second, was 
completely audible in the hall. The sparseness made the 
piece’s middle section, which began after the virtually 
silent three-minute soliloquy, all the more bizarre and 
colorful with its contrasting pizzicato, swirling cello 
glissandi, trills, and staccato notes, all of which were 
vibrant in the hall.
The evening ended with Britten’s second quartet, 
written in 1945, 30 years before his third. The piece 
ended with one of the violins playing the movement’s 
earlier melody, which clashed against the repeated C 
major chords played by the rest of the ensemble and 
refusing to resolve. But the theme eventually resolved 
to C major; the four triumphant C major chords that end 
the piece were brilliant, showcasing the ensemble’s 
perfect intonation, and the hall allowed the resonance of 
the chords and the ringing of the instruments to hang 
in the air.
The Chamber Music Society will continue the "Bridges” 
festival next year, so audiences can look forward to 
experiencing chamber music in the intimate New 
Hazlett again.

I remember walking home from high school one afternoon six years 
ago, listening to Sonic Youth’s Washing Machine on my Discman. 
Somehow, despite the insistence of all the press I had read and the 
recommendations of my friends, I hadn’t really been into Daydream 
Nation, the band’s landmark album that is supposedly its most 
influential, if not its best.
I had this odd habit at the time that I feel other people might understand. 
When I’d get a new album, if it was good, I’d only listen to the first half 
of it for months. At that age, I would get obsessed with new music 
easily and, honestly, the first few tracks on my favorite albums kept me 
busy for weeks. Anyway, at this point, six years go, I hadn’t actually 
gotten around to listening to the last track on Washing Machine, ‘The 
Diamond Sea.”
What took me over at first was the simplicity of the composition. The 
characteristic mirroring of the vocal line in the guitar and the simple 
drumming were absolutely beautiful. The guitars were restrained and 
almost gentle. I continued listening and was probably daydreaming 
about something unrelated when I suddenly started paying attention 
again: Around six or seven minutes into the track — the piece is about 
19 minutes long — I realized what I was listening to. It was noise. A 
straight-up wall of distorted noise. There was no melody, no vocals. 
This was the first time ever that I truly enjoyed listening to noise.
Since this incident, I’ve learned two important lessons about listening 
to music. First, albums may contain hidden treasures. It is my duty 
as a seeker of awesome sounds to find these treasures if they exist. 
Second, foreign genres of music are just like vegetables. You hate 
them when you’re young, refuse to try them, and hate them when you 
do. Then on some odd day you randomly eat something with broccoli 
in it, declare it tasty, and recoil in horror at the sudden cognitive 
dissonance. .
One of my favorite places on the Internet to get served up musical 
vegetables is www.muxtape.com, a sort of online mix tape simulator. 
The premise of the site is simple: You get one username and 12 
MP3 uploads, none of which can be over 10 megabytes large. After 
uploading songs you can change their order and share your username 
with your friends who can then get on the site and stream the tracks 
you put up in their browser. There are no comments, no stats, and no 
contact info for the muxtape makers. The front page of the site has 
links to a random selection of tapes, which I’ve been having a lot of fun 
exploring. Since they’re all made by people, the track selections are 
often very eclectic and fun.

A Moratorium on Make-Believe
Miller Gallery showcases works by MFA students
A Moratorium on Make-Believe is a final thesis exhibition 
put on by six graduating MFA students: Chris Beauregard, 
Michelle Fried, Ben Kinsley, Eileen Maxson, John Pena, and 
Ally Reeves. Showcasing various angles of unfamiliar reality, 
from fake YouTube videos with distorted sound to artifacts 
that may be real or made-up, the exhibit offers a unique and 
creative perspective in each of its works. A Moratorium on 
Make-Believe opened at the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery on 
March 21 and ends this Sunday, April 20.
The first floor showcases the work of Kinsley. Elaborating on 
the main focus of his work, Kinsley said, "A lot of the work 
that I do is juxtaposing two things that don’t make sense 
together, or finding a scenario that I’m in and imagining 
something that could happen there but that would not 
normally happen.”
On opening day, Kinsley got a high school marching band to 
come in and play for the audience on the first floor. Similar to 
a normal high school marching band performance, he set up 
bleachers for them to stand on and arranged for a backdrop. 
But soon after they started playing, half the band rose, 
marched into the elevator, and rode it up to the third floor, 
playing the whole time. After the other half of the band had 
followed, the entire band marched through the exhibit on the 
third floor. They then marched into the stairwell and through 
the other floors. This continued through the entire night. To 
help people track the progress of the band and understand 
what was causing all the noise, the feed from the security 
cameras was projected on a wall on the first floor. The exhibit 
still has the white bleachers in the corner, and visitors can 
watch the recording of the marching band projected on the 
wall as it wanders through the different floors of the gallery.
The second floor features the work of Fried, Maxson, and 
Beauregard. One of the most distinct elements in this portion 
of the exhibit is a video projection that features a talking 
stomach. This video is the work of Fried and tells the story of 
a woman who has stomach trouble and is seeking the help of 
a doctor. The characters and locations in the video are all dark 
and unsanitary, giving the viewer an unsettling and unclean 
feeling.
Maxson also explores the medium of video. She expresses 
her feelings against television and YouTube through a fake 
YouTube video that she created. The sound is distorted 
throughout the video, making it difficult to tell what is going 
on. The setting looks like a news broadcast but has flashes of 
other images in between. It is up to the audience to interpret 
what the situation is.
Adjacent to her video, Maxson has a square of space in which 
she has left a rope dangling from the ceiling. The setting has a 
theatrical air to it, and gives the onlooker a feeling of suspense 
along with the nagging urge to pull the rope. The rope is 
actually connected to a large net that contains hundreds of 
red and white balloons. Pulling the rope causes the net to 
give way and all the balloons to fall to the floor. According to 
Kinsley, this part of the exhibit was kind of an experiment, as 
Maxson was unsure whether anyone would end up pulling 
the rope, but on opening day, someone did and visitors 
immediately began stomping on the balloons. Currently, the 
rope has a note on it that states: "By pulling this rope you 
will buy this artwork. The cost is $500. If you ask me it’s a 
bargain.”
Beauregard, the third artist on this floor, explores the world of 
horror films and the idea of fake violence. The entrance to his 
exhibit is a blue police barricade that is unnaturally bent, as 
if meant to be crossed over. All of his pieces resemble props 
from the sets of horror movies, like a wall that says "shit just 
got real" in fake blood, a black crow, a severed hand, and 
axes made out of solidified blood. The exhibit is complete 
with a video made of fragmented images of rooms and a man 
chopping wood, giving the viewer the same eerie feeling that 
horror movies achieve.
One of the most interesting and intriguing parts of the exhibit 
is Peña’s work, displayed on the third floor. For the last five 
years, Peña has been in communication with the Pacific 
Ocean, sending letters every day addressed to “The Ocean.” 
Most of these letters have been returned to the sender, but 
many of them have not made it back, giving hope that they 
really did reach their destination. The exhibit shows all of 
Peña’s returned letters against a wall, and this dramatic
display instills a sense of awe in the onlooker, combined with 
a feeling of wistful curiosity about the content of the letters.
Continuing the theme of letters is a large white mailbox, 
complete with an upturned red flag, that stands before the 
wall of letters. This mailbox is for visitors to fill with their 
own letters. Peña promises that within his lifetime, he will 
deliver all the letters that are placed in this mailbox to their 
recipients.
Peña also captures the viewer’s attention and admiration 
by displaying pages from his written work. These pages are 
entirely hand-drawn with charcoal, making them captivating 
to behold. Apart from the beautifully drawn illustrations that 
accompany the story, even the text is a work of art, with a 
unique font drawn by Peña himself.
Reeves displays two interesting pieces in her exhibit, the 
Look-See Tree and the Mobile Museum. The Look-See Tree 
is a horizontal tree trunk connected to a bicycle. The trunk is 
inhabited by robotic birds and animals that seem to have built 
their nests and homes in it. Using creative social commentary, 
Reeves shows how the animals have adapted to industrial life 
by using garbage to build their living spaces. The contraption 
has a crank-operated generator that powers the cells and 
distance sensors in the tree; as a viewer approaches, the 
robotic bird and animals move and make sounds.
Reeves also has a Mobile Museum, a display case with 
bicycle wheels on either sides, containing many curious 
artifacts that are either “found or fake,” meaning that the story 
behind these objects is either true or made-up; it is up to the 
audience to decide and vote which are which.
The exhibit, on a whole, is very interesting and brings 
together talented artists that have their own unique ideas and 
ways of expression. Even though these artists are diverse, 
they still strangely fit together, creating an intriguing and 
worthwhile experience.

Cymbeline: Shakespeare’s greatest hits
Pitt Repertory Theatre parodies little-known romance
Stacking up cases of deceit, mistaken identity, and 
cross-dressing, Shakespeare's little-known romance 
Cymbeline is almost a greatest hits album of the playwright’s 
usual tricks. But, unlike some greatest hits albums, this one 
wouldn't sell — sacrificing content for twists and turns in the 
plot, Cymbeline is convoluted to the point of frustrating, as 
the omniscient audience must watch the characters struggle 
in vain to figure out who’s who, who’s dead, who’s related, 
who’s poisoned, who’s secretly female, and so on.
However, as is usually the case in show business, the solution 
to Cymbeline’s problem may as simple as marketing. Though 
Cymbeline may fall flat as a greatest hits album, or even as 
a play it succeeds as a parody — of itself, of Shakespeare, 
and of theatrical devices in general. And this is exactly the 
angle that the University of Pittsburgh’s Repertory Theatre 
decided to take, amplifying the play's ridiculous plotline with 
exaggerated gestures and even a couple of modem tunes. 
Directed by MFA student Chaya Gordon, Cymbeline opened 
at Pitt last Thursday in the Cathedral of Learning’s Studio 
Theatre and runs through this Sunday.
The story of Cymbeline centers on the family of a British 
king by the same name (played by Dangerfield G. Moore).
As the play begins, the king’s daughter, Imogen (Cory 
Tamler), marries the lesser-born Posthumus (Joseph J. 
Jackson) without her father's permission, which soon results 
in her beau getting banished, leaving his loyal servant 
Pisanio (Patrick A. Berger) to stay with Imogen. Meanwhile, 
Cymbeline's wife (Brittany Michelle Jones) hopes to marry 
Imogen to her dim-witted son Cloten (Ryan Ben), a whiny, 
loathsome character. On top of that, the king's two sons, 
Guiderius (Christina M. Kruise) and Arviragus (Nicole Lynn 
Wyland), were stolen from their cradles at birth, and no one 
knows where they are, or even if they know that they are 
royalty.
As the story heats up, a Roman soldier named Iachimo (Aaron 
Jefferson Tindall) challenges Posthumus to a bet, claiming
he can seduce Imogen. Although Imogen refuses Iachimo's 
approaches, the latter tricks Posthumus into thinking his new 
wife actually did cheat on him. Enraged, Posthumus sends a 
letter ordering Pisanio to kill Imogen.
Luckily, Pisanio believes that Imogen is innocent and 
disobeys his master's letter. To avoid any ramifications from 
the Iachimo scandal, Imogen flees her home disguised as a 
man, and eventually encounters some quaint country folk, 
Polydore and Cadwell, and their father Belarius (Ana Carolina 
Noriega).
And here, Cymbeline goes the way of Twelfth Night and 
Much Ado About Nothing, resulting in the characters’ (and 
audience's) infinite confusion. As it happens, "Polydore" 
and “Cadwell” are actually Guiderius and Arviragus — the 
missing princes, thus Imogen’s brothers — but none of the 
characters are so enlightened. Belarius, for example, knows 
the boys are princes, but has no idea that his male visitor 
is actually their sister, Imogen. Imogen, on the other hand, 
knows who she is, but does not know that her brothers are 
her brothers. And the brothers know nothing; they think 
themselves an average pair of country bumpkins, and, though 
taken aback by their strange, almost brotherly love for Imogen, 
have no idea that she is a woman — or their sister.
The rest of the play follows suit, culminating in a scene 
featuring nearly all of the characters, who take turns revealing 
information until everyone finally figures out what is going on; 
the audience, at this point, has known for at least 20 minutes. 
Still, this last scene manages to be amusing, as the characters 
all gasp every time they learn a new aspect of the plot, poking 
fun at the play's ironic format.
Under Gordon’s direction, Pitt’s Cymbeline features a host of 
vibrant acting. Ben gives a skillful, hilarious performance of 
the clueless Cloten, swordfighting like a girl and singing like 
one, too — the latter in the hopes of wooing Imogen — in 
a portrayal that leaves the audience howling. Still, Ben and
others sometimes take it too far, using crude gestures to 
emphasize certain Shakespearean innuendos, which more 
often succeed in nuance. Playing Pisanio (and, minorly, a 
British captain), Patrick A. Berger shines without mimicking 
his over-the-top peers; he is perfect for his part, though it is 
hard to not want to see him in a bigger one.
Other aspects of the production, including costume design 
and music, encompass a variety of time periods — for better 
or worse. Concerning costumes, characters sometimes 
seem to be wearing 17th-century garb, while others look 
straight out of the ’70s and '80s, and still others boast some 
bizarre combination of the aforementioned. The end effect 
is interesting, though it is difficult to discern a method 
behind the madness, so most of the choices wind up looking 
accidental. Moreover, the use of modern songs in the play’s 
beginning (“Love is a Battlefield”) and end (“(What’s So Funny 
’Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding") are a bit disorienting 
to the audience, although they do contribute to the show's 
overall parody vibe.
If the creators of Scary Movie had been alive in the 17th 
century, they might have written Cymbeline, but at present 
we can only credit the play to Shakespeare himself. Whether 
meant to be a parody or just unintentionally absurd, the play 
works well making fun of itself, a fact the students in Pitt 
Repertory Theatre used to their advantage.

Did you know?
April 22,1908
The word “nifty” is used to describe 
Stoebner’s, a shoe store, in an ad about 
the “New Pump, the show for young 
men — two holes — short vamps in Tan 
Dull and Patent." No, I can’t understand 
what they’re saying either.
April 15, 1958
In the “Letters to the Editor” section, 
a student suggests Buggy seminars 
to teach students how buggies work. 
Safety measures and course maps will 
be discussed. It's a good thing too 
after last year’s travesty, when several 
organizations took a wrong turn into 
Pitt’s campus, while others pushers 
carried scissors while running.
April 12, 1983
The Spring Carnival Committee 
announces its “Most Adventurous 
Costume” contest. Any Carnegie Mellon 
student is eligible to participate and must 
submit his or her design before opening 
ceremonies. It seems to me that the 
most adventurous costume would be 
no costume at all — I wonder if people 
had to wear the costume on campus to 
be eligible to win the contest.
April 13,1998
Carnegie Mellon staff and faculty 
participate in the Campus Celebrities 
talent show. One mathematics professor 
shows off his talent on the piano, while 
another reads fiction to students. 
Maybe the better idea would have been 
an untalent show. Carnegie Mellon 
students are tired of seeing talent. It’s 
time to watch someone fumble with 
tying their shoes.
April 14, 2003
A editorial writer for The Tartan reflects 
on his freedoms during “Beers Day,” 
the anniversary of the day Prohibition 
was overturned. Most of the article 
addresses how Americans should be 
proud of their freedom to drink. Around 
the end, the article addresses how 
alcohol "is liek the coolest” and “we 
realy shuold atke more teim to celebrte 
our librties.”
April 16, 2007
Carnegie Mellon proudly announces the 
addition of a linguistics major. Classes 
range from upper-level courses, such 
as 11-721 Grammars and Lexicons, 
to lower-level courses, such as 80-180 
The Nature of Language, to what-the- 
hell-are-you-doing-at-Carnegie-Mellon 
classes, such as 00-001 Hooked on 
Phonics.

From left to right: Barbuto's aviator sunglasses reflect her preppy style; Wieland's square white 
frames showcase her unique style; Huntley's white rose-printed sunglasses add to her quirky style.
Campus chic
Accessories make a comeback in this season’s trends
Accessories are making their triumphant comeback as 
clothing shifts towards minimalism. With main pieces now 
serving as the backdrop to an overall look, the spotlight shines 
on small adornments.
At the Marc Jacobs spring show, oversized bauble necklaces 
shifted the focus from clothing to accessories. Calvin Klein 
debuted an almost entirely white collection of pieces, with 
emphasis on simplicity and seamlessness. In order to keep 
from being too bland, the collection included post-modern 
sandals, cut and laced in unexpected ways. For Rodarte’s 
show, designers collaborated with Christian Louboutin, 
whose high-end shoes are known for their trademark red 
soles; Louboutin designed strappy sandals with metal studs, 
offsetting the femininity of the collection.
Runway fashion always tends to be over the top, but it 
nevertheless serves to be a promising way to find inspiration 
and new ways of wearing pieces. This is especially true for 
smaller accessories — spring has already come, and around 
campus, many have been sporting sunglasses of all different 
shapes and designs. Sophomore drama major Katie Wieland, 
first-year humanities and arts major Robin Huntley, and senior 
chemical engineering student Ester Barbuto are all perfect 
examples of how great the right pair of sunglasses can look. 
"Moschino is definitely my favorite designer. I also love J.Crew 
for more affordable buys," Baibuto said, and her style reflects 
her preppy chic influence. Aviators like hers have been long­
time favorites of students and celebrities alike, and Barbuto's 
add a slight sense of mystery and androgyny. However, with 
her feminine outfit, they complement her overall look.
Wieland, a fan of the '40s era, sports a white, square pair to 
contrast her vintage style. “I shop mostly at consignment 
stores for good vintage finds,” she said.
Lastly, Huntley wears thrifted wayfarers; but to add to her 
quirkiness, they are printed with small roses all over the 
frame.
All three wear their sunglasses the perfect way, but the key 
is to make sure the face frames them well — they should not 
overwhelm the face, nor should they be ill-fitting. The details 
and style are up to the wearer.
Summery shoes are just as important; if they don’t fit right 
and are uncomfortable, they can be painful and detract from 
the day Wieland’s strappy sandals, a popular look on runways, 
are full of details and fit just right. They complement her dress 
and lengthen her legs, but because they have a chunkier heel, 
don’t feel uncomfortable after a short time.
Huntley wears the ultimate in comfort sandals, three- 
strap Birkenstocks. “I'm definitely very laid-back, and my 
clothing reflects it," Huntley said. The sandals not only look 
unexpected, but, when paired with a laid-back dress, what 
results is a look that's both comfortable and chic.
Barbuto wears nude peep-toe wedges with a satin upper 
that tie her overall look together. They are basic in color and 
structure, but because satin shoes have tom through runways 
this season, Barbuto shows off her knowledge of the latest 
trends. Wedges in general are also excellent alternatives 
between flats and heels, because they provide support 
without sacrificing style.
Whether it’s sunglasses, shoes, bags, or even earrings, 
accessories are more welcome than ever. It isn’t about how 
they look: It is all about how they are worn and what they 
are worn with. Taking the time to get the right fit is also 
imperative, because otherwise even stylish items won’t be 
worn. Huntley, Wieland, and Barbuto demonstrate excellent 
examples of how they wear trends and show off their chic 
styles — all by drawing inspiration from vastly different 
sources.

skilled martial artist. He has the ability to shift into the Place Between

Saturday, SPIRIT, an organization that promotes African-American 
culture, held its annual fashion show. Along with fashion, the show 
included music and dance performances. Pictured here is a scene 
from "When we were queens,” a portion of the show dedicated to 
the style of high-society women in colonial Africa, choreographed by 
senior English major Louisa Kinoshi.The final act of the fashion show, 
which is always dedicated to a cause, raised awareness about HIV.
