tudents camp out for new housing
that
Br AMY LIPKE
Tartan StaffwriterTwo new residence buildings acquired by 
IcMU generated enough interest for students 
to begin lining up outside the Morewood Rec 
Room three days before the room reserva- 
ion process began.
Instead of using the usual lottery process 
or all room reservations, the Housing Of- 
decided this year to offer the off-campus 
ousing on a first-come, first-served basis, 
irector of Housing Tony Martin explained 
the decision was made in order to 
nerate interest in off-campus housing and 
hereby free more spaces in campus for in- 
oming freshmen.
“This is not the first time we’ve done this,” 
(tated Martin. “Three years ago the Univer- 
ty dropped a large building and . . . ac- 
¡uired Shadyside Apartments." At that time, 
e explained, the first-come, first-served 
tern was used. “Were repeating that 
cause it worked well before.”
The Housing Office uses this system to 
nerate interest among those who normal - 
would move into or retain spaces on cam- 
(us via the lottery system. This system of- 
:rs a chance at the more attractive apart- 
ents off camfms to underclassmen, who 
ive last choice under the lottery system, 
rted Martin. The more students who 
off campus, the more spaces left on
campus for incoming freshmen.
The two new buildings, 601 and 630 Clyde 
Street, captured student interest because of 
the large number of spacious and attractive 
apartments they offered. So much interest 
was generated , in fact, that some students 
began lining up on the evening of Monday, 
Feb. 25, three days before the reservation 
proces began. “I was surprised how long 
some students were willing to wait,” Martin said.
The three day wait became something of 
a slumber party. Students camped out in 
Morewood’s lobby and basement with sleep­
ing bags, television sets, and homework.
“It was quite an experience,” said Nancy 
Adelstein, who joined the line on Tuesday 
at 2:00 pm. “It was a last-minute decision. 
We just got together a group of us and decid­
ed to do it.” Asked whether it was worth the 
wait, she replied, “We got what we wanted 
and were all really excited.”
The long line angered many students, 
however. They felt that the need to provide 
spaces for freshmen could have been met in 
less awkward ways.
One student, who spent 44 hours in line, 
resented the fact that the Housing Office 
chose a method which afforded the best op­
portunities to those who could or would 
sacrifice classes, jobs, and study time to wait in line.
Students dressed to the theme of “Night” attend the Beaux Arts Ball, held in the 
College of Fine Arts building on February 23.
unt closes off meeting rooms
Hunt Library
By KAREN GRAY
Tartan News Editor
Hunt library meeting rooms previously 
made available to students will no longer be 
open for general use.
According to General Campus and Infor­
mation Committee chairman Peter Cohen, 
officials he talked with feel that there is “not 
enough manpower to assure that the rooms 
will be properly used."
Hunt Library Director Sylverna Ford explained reasons for the return to the 
policy of holding only scheduled 
in those rooms.
“[The rooms] were beginning to become 
quite a security problem in the out of the 
way areas,” Ford said. “People would study 
in them alone, late at night. Strange things 
could happen.”
Ford added that the rooms were “being 
left filthy,” which caused problems for those 
holding scheduled meetings immediately 
after a student or group of students had 
studied there.
The rooms in question are the seminar 
room on the second floor and the Fine Arts 
classroom on the fourth floor.
The other study rooms in the library, 
however, “will remain untouched,” according 
to Ford.
Part of the problem, she explained, “is 
that this university is growing. The usage of 
this library is increasing tremendously. 
There used to be a lot of open areas. As 
usage goes up, the seating becomes shorter.”
When asked about the extra study space 
provided by the Engineering and Science 
Library in Wean Hall, Ford replied that even 
though the E&S library has been renovated, 
it is still not as attractive to students as Hunt:
“There’s a lot of interest in little study areas. 
People aren’t interested in being in one big 
area. In Hunt there are little nooks and 
crannies for people to hide.”
Cohen said that the GC&I committee will 
be working on this problem and “may have 
to ask for the backing of student Senate to 
suggest that the library not close those 
rooms.”
He added, however, “Under the cir­
cumstances, the administrators are doing the 
best they can.”

Student dies from overdose Religious
illustration major died Sunday, 
February 24 of a fatal dose of sleeping
tablets.
Mary Moriarty, 20, died at 3 p.m. Sun- 
jjiyt hours after she ingested the tablets 
upon her return from the Beaux Arts Ball, 
which ended early that morning.
The County Coroner told the Moriar­
ty family in Falls Church, Virginia that 
Mary, known by friends as “Molly,” had 
died of a reaction between sleeping 
tablets and beer from Beaux Arts.
Molly had a history of heart trouble 
! and weighed a scant 115 pounds. In a 
statement issued last week, the family 
noted how frail Molly’s body was: “She 
had had beer on some occasions, and 
sleeping tablets on other occasions,” said 
the statement. “Never, though, had she 
taken both concurrently. She probably 
didn’t know their combination would 
¡produce a deadly mixture ... it was a
I matter of her system being worn down 
¡rather than a willful assault.”
Molly’s friends remember her as an 
¡energetic individual who demanded the 
¡most life had to offer.
joyed running and was on the CMU 
women’s track team.
According to Art Department Head Or­
ville Winsand, a memorial tribute to Mol­
ly will be held tomorrow, March 6 at 
11:30 a.m. in Skibo’s Wherrett Room, 
which will include short comments by 
students and faculty. A Molly Moriarty 
Memorial Fund will be created to benefit 
an outstanding Illustration student. 
Details will be announced at the Tribute, 
but contributions can be directed to the 
Department of Art with checks made out 
to CMU.
Molly Moriarty is survived by her 
father Robert W., her mother Mary Fran­
cis, and her six brothers Stephen, 
Timothy, Thomas, Michael, Patrick, and 
Daniel. She is also survived by the 
countless friends who were changed by 
having known her.
discussions 
launched
By LAURA GOLOWICH
Special to The Tartan
Last Wednesday, five chaplains from the 
CMU Chaplains’ Council launched their 
first of five luncheon discussions with the 
topic, “What is Religion?” This event kick­
ed off a series of five “Brown Bag Conversa­
tions," which will take place at Morewood 
Gardens Cafeteria every Wednesday through 
April 3rd from 11:30-1:00. The discussions 
are open to all students, faculty, and staff.Rev. Paul Beattie of the First Unitarian 
Church led the discussion, defining religion 
as “an individual’s whole response to all life.” 
Religion encompasses, he said, “the core of 
attitudes and values out of which you live.”

“We have about a dozen people who have

Media-related job opportunities increase
PRINCETON, N.J. (January 25, 1985) 
More than half of the nation’s journalism 
and mass communications college graduates 
in 1984 found media-related work.
The annual employment survey of jour­
nalism graduates, compiled for the 
Newspaper Fund by the Journalism 
Resources Institute of Rutgers University, 
showed a 6 percent increase in the number of media jobs offered to the class of 1984.Approximately 9,600 of the nation’s 
17,200 bachelors degree-recipients last year 
had been hired by media companies when 
the survey was conducted.
More than 54 percent of the minorities 
who received journalism and mass com­
munications degrees in 1984 were hired in 
entry-level media jobs, compared with 41 
percent the year before. Daily and weekly 
newspapers hired 16.5 percent of the minori­
ty grads, while 13.9 percent of the minorities 
took jobs in broadcasting.
Looking at the class as a whole, the report 
shows that daily newspapers continue to hire 
more college journalism majors than any 
other media-related field, including radio,
television, magazines, wire services, adver­
tising agencies and public relations firms.
Weekly and daily newspapers and news 
services hired more than 17 percent of the 
graduates, compared with 14 percent of the 
1983 graduates. There continued to be one 
news job for every 2 V6 graduates who made 
an attempt to locate work at a newspaper 
or news service.
Advertising agencies were the second most 
popular employers for the 1984 graduates, public relations firms were third and televi­
sion stations fourth.Ad agencies hir#d 8.6 percent of the 
media grads, while public relations agencies 
and corporate PR departments hired an ad­
ditional 8.5 percent of the class.
Radio and television stations evenly divid­
ed slightly more than 10 percent of the jour­
nalism graduates. Magazines hired almost 3 
percent of the grads, while about 7 percent 
took other media-related jobs.
The unemployment rate for the May/June 
graduates four months after graduation was 
nearly 12 percent, a 1 percent drop since
1983.
“The field of journalism higher education 
is at a critical point of evaluation and design 
to meet future needs,” said Jerome Aumente, 
director of the Journalism Resources In­
stitute of Rutgers University. “The results of 
this study will help point us in the right 
direction. The Journalism Resources In­
stitute was delighted to participate in the 
Newspaper Fund in this study.”
The Dow Jones Newspaper Fund is a 
foundation that encourages young people to 
consider careers in journalism. The founda 
tion’s programs include scholarships and in 
ternships for college students, workshops f0r 
high school newspaper advisers and minont students, and a career information program 
that includes the annual “Journalism Career 
and Scholarship Guide” and a slide show 
about newspaper careers.
History professor's 
book wins prize
PITTSBURGH — Carnegie-Mellon 
University Professor of History Michael 
Weber and two colleagues from other 
universities have shared the Polish American 
Historical Association’s 1984 Oscar Halecki Prize for their book Lives of Their Own: 
Blacks, Italians and Poles in Pittsburgh, 
1900 - 1960.The book uses quantitative data and ex­
tensive interviews to compare the experiences of two generations of Poles, Italians and 
Blacks who migrated to Pittsburgh from rural areas between 1900 and 1960.
The association cited the book as a I 
distinguished piece of scholarship which has I 
shed light in a crucial yet Xinexplored areal 
of the Polish American experience. The I 
book explores work and career patterns ofl 
Poles in the city of Pittsburgh, a subject! 
about which we have only had largely im [ 
pressionistic evidence.”
Weber is coauthor with Professors Johnl 
Bodnar of Indiana University and Roger! 
Simon of Lehigh University.

ROTO scholarship programs described
The Army Reserve Officer Training Corps 
has come a long way since the 1960’s and 
70s when student disruption on college cam-
pusesand universities caused ROTC enroll
ment to drop sharply.
Today applications are pouring in in 
record-breaking numbers. They’re being 
submitted by students from across the na­
tion who desire scholarships at the more 
than 300 schools that offer military science 
courses. The courses are also offered at more 
than 700 other colleges and universities 
through cross-enrollment agreements and 
extension centers.
Chris Holliday, Chief of the ROTC 
Scholarship Branch, which is located at the 
Training and Doctrine Command Head­
quarters at Fort Monroe, VA, feels there are three basic reasons why applications have in­
creased in the last three years. “The need for 
financial assistance, and upward trends in 
national patriotism and conservatism, and 
the lagging civilian job market have all con­
tributed to the 65 percent increase in the at­
tractiveness of ROTC scholarships. Students 
are considering what the job opportunities 
will be after graduation and they know 
they’re guaranteed a job with the Army.” En­
try pay is approximately $18,000 per year 
with free dental and medical coverage.
The Army is especially looking for 
students interested in all phases of engineer­
ing and the hard sciences, specifically 
physics, biology' and mathematics.
Sixteen different scholarship programs are 
offered. One of these is the three-year pro­
gram for freshmen with a 2.5 GJ^A. Another 
is a two year program for juniors with a 2.0 GPA.
Army ROTC scholarships pay tuition as 
well as a flat rate for textbooks, supplies and 
equipment, lab fees and certain other
educational expenses. Additionally, scholar­
ship winners receive a monthly allowance of 
S100 for up to 10 months of each year the 
scholarship is in effect. Cadets are also paid 
for summer training, to include transporta­
tion to and from camp. Camp is six weeks 
long. The Basic Camp is located at Fort 
Knox, Kentucky, outside of Louisville. Ad­
vanced Camp is located at Fort Bragg, 
North Carolina, outside of Fayetteville.
Additional information may be obtained 
by visiting Captain Perry Colvin in the base­
ment of Margaret Morrison (B7) or by call­

CMU and PPA collaborate on new art gallery
PITTSBURGH — The Carnegie-Mellon 
University College of Fine Arts and the Pitt­
sburgh Plan for Art(PPA) announce the for­
mation of the Carnegie-Mellon University
Art Gallery.Elaine King, CMU assistant professor of 
art history and director of the Hewlett 
Gallery, will direct the new gallery, which 
will occupy the PPA space on Craig Street, 
Oakland, as of September 1.
Announcement of the collaboration bet­
ween PPA and CMU was made jointly by 
Robert J. Dodds III, PPA board chairman,
I and Dean Akram Midani of CMU’s College 
of Fine Arts.
“In creating the gallery through coopera­
tion with PPA,” Midani said, “CMU is pro­
viding Pittsburgh with a high quality artistic 
institution which will enrich the communi- 
I ty and improve the quality of its cultural life. 
I In addition to CMU’s recent endeavors in the 
field of technology, the university through 
its College of Fine Arts is once more mak- 
I ing a major statement bridging scientific 
[and artistic cultures.”
The 30-year-old PPA was founded and 
partially funded originally with the support 
of Norman Rice, then dean of the CMU Col­
lege. of Fine Arts. The gallery has been 
described as one of the best exhibition spaces 
between New York and Chicago. From its 
(beginning, PPA was committed to contem­
porary art and artists of national 
I importance.
King, who has headed CMU’s Hewlett

In the CMU Art Gallery she plans to 
showcase high quality national and interna­
tional artists who have shown or will show 
their work in the Hewlett Gallery in the
coming months.
In addition, the space will show a curated 
Pittsburgh artists show, the annual CMU art 
faculty show, collaborative efforts with the 
CMU Drama Department and group exhibi­
tions which will travel to other universities 
and museums in an exchange program King 
plans to develop. One of the first artists to 
show at the CMU Art Gallery will be Mel 
Bochner, a CMU alumnus and abstract
painter. The Bochner show will then travel 
to the Kunstmuseum in Lucerne, 
Switzerland.King said she sees the new gallery involv­
ed in the “exploration of serious, contem­
porary art — an extension of the activities 
of the Carnegie Institute Museum of Art.” 
The Hewlett Gallery in the College of Fine 
Arts will remain under King’s direction and 
feature works on paper — photographs, 
prints, drawings and installations.

This Week in Senate
By JEFF SOLLER
Student Senate Vice-Chair
“This Week in Senate” is an article which 
will supplement or replace the weekly Stu­
dent Senate minutes. Its intent is to inform 
students of recent happenings on Senate and 
expound on their causes and implications.
Recently there have been two important 
topics featured on Student Senate. The first, 
UNIVERSITY WIDE CORE CUR­
RICULUM, is an important step in making 
CMU a liberal professional institution. Dr. 
W. Andrew Achenbaum visited Senate two 
weeks ago to explain this approach to educa­
tion and to answer questions.
The proposed university wide core cur­
riculum would require all undergraduate 
students to take “university wide re­
quirements” and “departmental and college 
requirements.” Presently, all requirements 
are departmental or collge specific. The 
university wide requirements will be spread 
over four years and will probably include 
such topics as:
1. An entry level writing course.
2. Workshop on computing at CMU.
3. Student participation in designing an 
interdisciplinary research project.
4. Student demonstration of competence 
in their discipline and the ability to com­
municate their ideas to an intelligent lay 
audience.
In addition? there will be University wide in­
itiatives to:
1. Establish a writing across the cur­
riculum program.
2. Encourage computer assisted 
instruction.
3. Facilitate creation of interdisciplinary 
ventures and establishment of double ma­
jors between colleges.
As can be easily seen by examination of 
these requirements and ambitions, the goal 
of this program is to add effective com­
munication between professionals, and in­
telligent use of the computer as an in­
valuable tool to the already technical educa­
tion at CMU. By joining these skills to CMU s

prepared to face the problems of the cor­
porate world. The experience which will be 
gained by working and studying in inter­
disciplinary areas will be indispensable. The 
UNIVERSITY WIDE CORE CUR­
RICULUM program certainly seems to be 
an excellent first step toward liberalizing the 
education at this institution.
The other highlighted Senate issue per­
tains to the establishment of the Guardian 
Angels at CMU. Paul Martinelli, the Pitt­
sburgh leader of the Guardian Angels, and 
Sergeant Long, Campus Security, were both 
present at a recent Senate meeting. An open 
conversation and question and answer 
period were held. Several points became 
clear at the meeting:
1. There exists a need for a walking escort 
at night on and around campus.
2. Students would feel safer and more 
secure if there was an escort service and 
walking patrol of our campus.
3. The Guardian Angels are willing to 
provide such a service.
4. Security’s position is opposed to having 
an outside group such as the Guardian 
Angels perform this service.
There are presently Guardian Angels 
establishments at 7 other universities 
throughout the country. They feel that a 
walking escort is the only type of service 
needed at CMU. Campus Security was 
unaware of the desire for this type of service, 
but now is willing to begin steps toward crea­
tion of one. The details of this program are 
presently being worked out. Comments and 
opinion should be sent to the Student Senate 
office Skibo 59.
Religious
discussions
continued from page 3
Fr. Alexander Webster of the Orthodox 
Christian Fellowship proposed that the 
definition of religion is based on one Truth 
which is God, rather than on a “perception 
of supposed reality.” Rev. Beattie advocated 
an opposing view, asserting that truth is 
perceived differently by different 
generations.
Rev. Jim Miller of the United Campus 
Ministry advocated that peoples relationship 
with God changes God; how can God care 
so much about us, he asked, without being 
affected by us? Sister Bernadette Young of 
the Roman Catholic Oratory emphasized the 
personal as well as abstract nature of God
Next Wednesday’s discussion, “Religion 
and Science: Conflict or Complement?” will 
be led by Rev.’s Miller and Beattie. Later 
topics include “Religion and Economics: 
The Computer vs. Freedom From Religion,” 
and “Religion and Art: Faith and the Im 
agination.”
Leaders of subsequent discussions will also 
include Rev. Bob White of the United Cam­
pus Ministry, Rev. Jon Wilson of the Canter 
bury Episcopal Fellowship, Rabbi Joe Levine 
of the Jewish University Center, and Rev. 
Paul Sampsell of the Lutheran University 
Center. All students, faculty, and staff are 
invited to participate in these discussions.

[esearch on futuristic economy furthers bank deregulation
HELENE NEWBERG
brtan Staffzvriter
peole are now researching ways to run our 
conomy without money.
Instead of handing over a dollar to buy 
ll&M’s, transactions would be recorded elec- 
lonically, to a bank or computer. We would 
ch have an account which would record 
ach purchase made, like our computer ac- 
ounts on the TOPS system.
According to Dr. Bennet McCallum, pro- 
issor of economics at Carnegie-Mellon, im- 
llementation of such a monetary system 
lerhaul is not feasible. George is safe on his 
ollar bill.
Interested in bank deregulation
Research on such a futuristic economy 
have a purpose, however. “The resear- 
liers are mainly interested in bank 
eregulation,” McCallum said. I learned 
|iat our economy does not run as smoothly 
i perhaps I would like it to, considering the 
hmey I have is the only means I have of ob- 
lining things like books, food, and an 
flucation.”
The shape of our economy is currently 
molded from the amount of money printed 
and circulated at any given time. The stan­
dard unit of exchange is paper money 
which, aside from being a fairly new ven­
ture, is not working very well, according to 
McCallum.
As recently as thirty years ago, the view 
on our exchange system was very different. 
Instead of being regulated by paper dollars, 
our economy was based on gold or silver. 
The paper dollars in existence were claims 
to a portion of that precious metal.
“Our government prints money too fast”
Now there has been a “complete divorce” 
from this style of running our economy. “On 
the average,” McCallum says, “our govern­
ment prints money too fast” to keep our 
system running smothly. Certainly this must 
affect us in some way. Since money is so im­
portant, it doesn’t seem right to issue it in 
wrong quantities. Printing money at an ac­
celerated rate means that the value of the 
dollar declines.
“We’ll keep muddling along”
But another consequence of the stepped- 
up rate of issuance is a temporary increase 
in jobs. The good effects of issuing money 
before it is needed happen quickly--jobs 
skyrocket, and people sense the better times 
of having more money.
However, with the decreased dollar value, 
resulting from more money, inflation rises 
and jobs dissipate. This second process hap­
pens more slowly than the increase in iobs. 
As a result, the government has decided to 
ride out the benefits from the practice of 
over-issuing money, and continues to over­
print money to stave off the ill-effects caus­
ed by the process. “We'll keep muddling 
along,” said McCallum, caught in this circle.
The research, then, helps economists 
understand why, all of a sudden, there was 
a longer inflationary trend than had ever 
been seen before. Until recently, inflation 
had not followed any long, general trend. 
But since we switched to regulation by 
dollars, inflation has risen constantly. 
McCallum hopes research will lead to im­
provements in our current system, possibly 
even adjustments in our constitution to 
eliminate the cycle in which we’ve gotten 
stuck.
McCallum has written between 50 and 60 
papers on the subject of our monetary 
system. He currently has a hand in editing 
two economic publications, and serves as an 
advisor to the Richmond Federal Reserve 
Bank.

Professor explores deplorable prison conditions
By DENNIS COHEN
Tartan Staffivriter
The overcrowding of prisons and other 
correctional institutions is one of the nation's 
most serious, yet seemingly least publicized 
social issues.
In Pennsylvania, for example, a recent 
study found that state prisons are filled to 
133 percent capacity. The same study also 
predicted that if prison populations continue 
to increase at the same rate, Pennsylvanina 
state prisons will house 16,000 inmates by 
1990. One CMU faculty member is sear­
ching for solutions to this problem.
Increase capacity
According to Alfred Blumstein, the Eve 
Johnsen Professor of Urban Systems and 
Operations Research at the School of Urban 
and Public Affairs, there exists three 
methods for decreasing the state’s prison 
population. The first is to simply increase 
the capacity of state correctional facilitities 
by building new prisons and expanding ex­
isting ones. However, limited time and 
money make this proposal inadequate in the 
short run.
Another answer Blumstein has proposed 
is “diversion at the front door.”
Grass roots pressure
Essentially, this involves decreasing the
number of people sent to jail. Several alter- blem of overcrowded prisons, according to
natives to incarceration have been suggested, Blumstein. . - •
including probation, community group. /or Shorter sentenceshomes and community service programs.
The most important aspect of this solution, "Increasing the flow out the back door 
however, is that it provides an immediate, '4, is*a third possible method for reducing the 
relatively inexpensive solution to the pro- number of inmates in state prisons, said

Dear Diary
By Kristen Kovacic 
Special to The Tartan
They’re back, you know. You’ve seen traces 
of them on the walls: the Eiffel Tower, the 
Garden of Mirabell, Columbus’ clipper in 
the waters of the Carribbean.
They’re the Summer Programs 1985, in­
tegrated foreign study offerred by the 
Modern Languages Program in Paris, Ger­
many and Austria, and The Dominican 
Republic. They may be the best-kept secrets 
on campus. But not for long. Word is get­
ting out.
The programs are not at all like the 
EVERY COUNTRY IN-THE-UNI VERSE 
IN-A-WEEK extravaganzas you see stapled 
on every door and doorknob.
In the literature from the CMU Summer 
Programs, you’ll see things like “a grasp of 
contemporary French society, its problems 
and prospects,” “an understanding of the in­
terrelationship between Latin America and 
the United States in an historical and 
economic context,” “the sense of personal 
pleasure and discovery generated by living 
and working in a foreign country.”
These are “integrated” programs, pulling 
together, in one summer: intensive language 
study on the CMU campus, language and 
cultural study at institutions abroad, tours 
and excursions in the countries visited.
In addition, the Modem Languages Pro­
gram offers 30 units of credit for the Paris 
and Dominican Republic programs, 27 units 
for the Germany/Austria Program. Students 
who successfully complete all parts of the 
programs will fulfill their Language, Culture 
and Arts requirements in H&SS.
But perhaps the best-kept secret of all is 
the priceless experience of living abroad that
Today I discovered the 
benefits of study abroad
each of these programs offers. Just ask some 
of the people who’ve gone. Better yet, let’s 
peer into the journal kept by one of the Paris 
participants two years ago, to see just what 
that experience can mean:
1 Juillet Vendredi (that’s French for Friday, 
the first of July)
We took our entrance exams today. But 
that wasn’t the first thing. Early, we walked 
in the Luxembourg gardens. There is so 
much public stuff in Paris. In the Luxem­
bourg, there’s a park, some game areas, ten­
nis, puppets, a fountain, palm trees, and of 
course, the palace. Cafes are very public — 
the chairs turned to the street — gardens, 
squares. No one seems to want to be alone.
3 Juillet
I like breakfast here. Baguette, butter and 
jam, bowls of coffee or chocolate. It tastes 
good every day. But the taste is enriched, I 
think, by the possibility of something going 
wrong. I mean, you know exactly what you 11 
get when you open the Com Flakes. There’s 
an element of suspense and desire in this. 
“Today,” we say, “yes today the bread is fine!'
7 Juillet
A day in the country. The air was wonder­
ful, the countryside reminded me of 
Pennsylvania — rolling hills. M. Resnick 
claims that we walked 14 kilometres. It really 
didn’t seem that long. At one point, we stop­
ped at a dairy farm and bought some of 
their yogurt. I never realized that yogurt 
could quench your thirst.

Businessmen to tell students about entrepreneurship
By TONY GALE
Special to The Tartan
If entrepreneurship interests you, mark 
Saturday March 30, 1985 on your calendar 
and plan to attend the Student-Almuni 
Relations Council’s Business conference on 
Entrepreneurship.
Many speakers and panelists at the con­
ference will be CMU alumni who have 
started their own successful business. The 
conference will be moderated by three 
members of the Enterprise Corporation of 
Pittsburgh.
The Enterprise Corporation was started 
in October of 1984 as a private, non-profit 
organization to assist entrepreneurs in star­
ting high growth firms in the Pittsburgh 
area. They are also involved in presenting
seminars and forums for potential en­
trepreneurs and sponsoring courses in en­
trepreneurship. They maintain close associa­
tions with both Pitt and CMU. Some 
businesses that have received assistance from 
the Enterprise Corporation include Com­
puter Renaissance American Robotics and 
Mindbank. Many businesses were initiated 
by graduates and faculty of 
Carnegie-Mellon.
Jack Thome, chairman of The Enterprise 
Corporation, will be one of the moderators 
at the Business Ventures conference on 
March 30. Thorne is widely known 
throughout the United States as a strong 
believer in entrepreneurial growth potential. 
He has served as an advisor to many start­
up businesses and corporations;
After graduating from GSIA in 1952 he 
moved to California and worked for a few 
years with Litton Corporation and Hughes 
Aircraft. Soon after he started his own 
business. Later he sold it and moved back 
to his hometown, Pittsburgh.
In 1984, with a one million dollar grant 
from the Mellon Foundation he started The 
Enterprise Corporation. Today he continues 
as chairman of The Enterprise Corporation 
and adjunct professor at GSIA where he
teaches a course in Entrepreneurship t0 
second-year students.
According to Thorne, “A super commit- 
ted person with an insane perseverance in 
the face of endless obstacles,” is the defini- 
tion of an entrepreneur. So if you think that 
you meet the qualifications, plan to attend 
Business Ventures Saturday March 30, 1985 
in GSIA. Pre-registration is required. For 
further information contact the Alumni of 
fice in Warner Hall, x2060.

Mayor’s Reception at the Hotel de Ville: 
You couldn’t overdress for this one, such a 
grand place. Champagne et gateaux. Quel 
luxe. We walked home through the 
Tuilleries, just to chase pigeons in our good 
clothes, I think.
Later we all went out. We’ve established 
a small clique of assorted nationalities. 
There are the Italians: Monica the Beauty, 
Rosanna the married (but young at heart), 
and Piero the shy and handsome. It’s funny 
how people follow stereotypes — the Italians 
are by far the most expressive; I love the way
their language sings. The Germans are a lit­
tle stiff; ther is Bertholt, a true Bavarian, 
Max the intellectual, with his Oxford 
English, and Michael who practically yodels 
when he talks. Maria Theresa is from Mex­
ico and I love to hear her say Guadalahara. 
She gets 10 letters a day from her enormous 
family. When were out, like tonight at Sacre 
Coeur —oh the view! —we’re constantly talk­
ing. Last night we bought some wine and 
sat on the hillside there singing. We thought 
about leaving, leaving Paris, and decided 
wed rather bury ourselves on the spot.
More information on all of the summer pro 
grams is available at the History and 
Philosophy office, 240 Baker Hall. Deadline 
for applications is April 1. Get in on the 
secret, soon. Then pass it on.

The Spectator: Mixed 
review of The Misanthrope
By JONATHON STEELE
Special to The Tartan
The recent production of Moliere’s The 
Misanthrope in the Kresge Theater was 
reasonably well-handled by CMU’s drama 
department. The show had the style of the 
period, although the interpretation was 
more contemporary than Seventeenth Cen­
tury, and this made the play’s message a bit 
murky.
The Spectator
Photo by Steve Volan
This partygoer’s costume was voted the best of the hundreds worn to this year’s Beaux 
Arts Ball. For more Beaux Arts photos, see page 19.
Moliere is best known for his great com­
edies of character in which he lampoons vice 
or excess in human behavior. His method is 
to caricature a person who represents a 
quality like greed or hypocrisy. He was 
strongly against intellectual and social 
pretentiousness, and supported moderation 
and reason.
His sharp pen ruffled many feathers and 
resulted in his having powerful enemies. He 
was the target of personal attacks on his 
private life, and was intensely criticized for 
the uncompromising satire of his writing. 
Tartuffe, which attacks hypocritical, false 
piety, aroused strong public protest. Don 
Juan, interpreted as being in favor of 
atheism, was removed from the stage, and
Barbara Baxley has directed the current 
production of The Misanthrope with a good 
sense of the period. She has interpreted the 
central characters of Alceste and Celimene 
more naturally and the rest of the cast more 
as character types, which is accurate from 
a 20th Century point of view, but probably 
not the intention in Moliere’s day. The stag­
ing works efficiently. She has combined the 
settings, costumes and general speech and 
movement with a perception of Moliere’s 
style. The hint of commedia del arte given 
by Tom Willmorth’s pantomimic Basque was 
an excellent touch. However, this servant 
could have been more all-knowing and 
biting in the Moliere tradition.
The comparisons between English and 
American actors point up a failure of this 
production. Miss Baxley has permitted a 
mixture of acting stylés, especially in the per­
formance of Keven Black as Alceste. This 
young man is a fine, talented actor and he 
understands his character well. But he is us­
ing a contemporary7, American style of move­
ment which is jarring in contrast with the 
classic style utilized by the rest of the cast. 
He simply is not standing still. Moving on 
the other characters lines muddies focus. 
Excessive gesturing on his lines gives a light 
weight tone to Alceste’s problems. 1 have seen

Forbes Gallery features four senior artists
By LYNNE. M. SCHATZ
Special to The Tartan
Exhibited this week at the Forbes Gallery 
is the work of senior artists Suzan Katcher, 
Susan Pfuhl, Jack Sheffler, and Renee 
Smith. The show, which opens this evening 
at 7:00, features a variety of painting and 
prints.
Suzan Katcher, a print major, displays 
silkscreens, lithos, and intaglios. 
Characteristic of Katcher’s work is the use 
of strong color and imagery.
“I like sharp shapes,” said Katcher, “shapes 
that could kill.” Katcher enjoys experimen­
ting in her work by cutting up her images 
or drawing on them.
T think people are sometimes down on 
silkscreen, thinking that there are too many 
commercial aspects to it,” said Katcher. “J, 
want to make the actual image important; 
I don’t want to make just pretty things.” 
Katcher likes to work spontaneously, fre­
quently taking as her theme the idea of 
something “not fitting in.” In Fragmented 
Rhythm, one of Katcher’s larger pieces, the 
artist cuts up and repeats a single, jagged 
image in muted primary colors.
Susan Pfuhl, also a print major, works 
more from a plan than does Katcher. “I plan 
the piece, then do it,” said Pfuhl. “There’s 
an element of ‘let’s see what happens,’ but 
for the most part, the piece is planned.”
was not published in Moliere’s lifetime. controlled presence. He should have been
checked here.
The show was satisfying and had some 
quite funny moments. Basically the cast cap­
tures the period essence. Good performances 
were turned by Paul G. Schoeffler. Michael 
Goldenberg, Robert A. Woronoff, and Tom 
Wood.
Set design by Kent Homchick was ex­
cellent. The settings evoked a sense of the 
period with great theatricality. Costumes by 
Anthony French were good, and the lighting 
by William Nelson worked well. Sound 
design by Chris Dudas, a bouncy version of 
Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos, was well 
chosen and effective.
Pfuhl has been working for the last two 
years on a silkscreen series of water lilies. Her 
work began when she shot several rolls ot 
film of water lilies at the Phipps 
Conservatory.
“I liked the colors in the lilies,” said Pfuhl. 
“To me, color is the most important thing. 
In the end, the figurative aspect is not im­
portant to me.”
By using blends of color on the screen, 
Pfuhl creates prints that combine the col­
ors important to her work. Her lilies are ex­
ecuted in varying shades of purple, green 
and magenta, creating what Pfuhl terms 
“striations of color” within the piece.

Dave Rudolf: spontaneous music and fun
Bv ANTHONY V. DATRI
Tartan Entertainment Editor 
Who looks like Martin Mull, sounds like 
Gordon Lightfoot, and thinks like George 
Carlin? Gentle readers, I give you the one, 
the only, Dave Rudolph.
Dave Rudolph appeared this Saturday in 
the Wherrett Room, and delighted the au­
dience with his unique blend of music and 
comedy. Although Dave started out about 
eight years ago as a completely serious musi­
cian, his act has developed more of a com- edy nature.
Ke has, however, not lost his talent for folk 
singing and guitar playing. Although a 
number of fans have likened him to Gordon 
Lightfoot, Rudolph discourages the com­
parison, as he does not copy anyone. In fact, 
Dave writes almost all of his own material, 
and has written songs for other entertainers, 
mo*t notably his friend — and CMU hero 
Michael Spiro, with whom he cowrote High 
Tide and Timeless. Rosanne Cash is also con- 
s'dering recording one of his songs.
Rudolph performed in front of a small au- ^ence, which may be partially explained by 
lack of advertisement. The mood was in­
formal, and he interacted well with the au­
dience, and even came to know a number 
people by their first names. Unlike many 
Performers, Rudolph begins a performance 
without a set schedule of material. Iwice
when people tried to leave, Rudolph ran 
down the aisle out into the hallway to pur­
sue them, and good naturedly persuaded 
one embarassed girl to return.
“If a mime fell in the woods, 
would he make any noise?”
Rudolph involves his audience in his per­
formances, a welcome relief from the nor­
mal stand-up comedian, who is often distant 
and somewhat impersonal. At one point, he 
threw makeshift drums into the audience so 
that they could join him in one of his songs. 
Some performers (like Pee Wee Herman) rely 
on a myriad of one-time props, but not 
Rudolph. His performance centered around 
him and his guitar, with few outside sources 
of humor to rely upon. The sole exception 
was a moving message display—like the ones 
in Gray Matter and the Tartan Grill that 
captivate us between classes —that could be 
seen blending in with the sound system. The 
display ran for the entire show, and provid­
ed such mind provoking thoughts as Kmart 
blue light specials and prompts as “AP­
PLAUD” and “LAUGH”. One particularly 
though provoking question was “If a mime 
fell in the woods, would he make any noise?”
When all was told and played, Dave 
Rudolph had shared with us an entertain­
ing evening of spontaneous music and fun,
and had provided a friendly, relaxed respite 
from the impersonal, pressured life that we 
as CMU students face every day.

"Devil music" misconceptions dispelled
By LESLEY BRUNKER
Tartan Contributing Editor
The devil almost came to Pittsburgh —or 
so Dicesare & Engler would have us believe. 
Mercyful Fate, perhaps the most controver­
sial- band in recent history, was dropped 
from a triple bill (with Armoured Saint and 
Motorhead) in a show that was later cancell­
ed last December. The reason: their lyrical 
content.
Fate’s latest album, Don’t Break the Oath, 
was banned in England for the same reason, 
as were Venom’s last two albums, Black 
Metal and At War With Satan. The 
righteous may claim this is violation of their 
first amendment guarantee of freedom of 
speech. If they want to sing about the devil, 
necromancy, and the occult, well, then, let
However, for a band serious about its 
work, this is counterproductive. Banned 
albums generate no revenue; cancelled 
shows gain no new audience. Sacrificing 
musical content by singing about one topic 
is limiting and boring. And putting too 
much stock in a stage show carried by 
mediocre music is a fast track to musical 
oblivion.
Yet Fate’s Don’t Break the Oath is a sound 
album. While the lyrical content will pro­
bably offend most serious Christians (“I ab­
jure the Christian Faith/ and Jesus Christ, 
the Deceiver”) and the crunch of the guitar 
solos are lost in poor mixing, the instrumen­
tal section is solid metal. Timi Hansen lays 
down a solid bass line, and Hank Sherman 
and Michael Denner do some tasty dual 
guitar work, particularly in “Nightmare”
and “Night of the Unborn.”
What has paved the way for the existence 
of such bands, conceived in the name of 
music yet dedicated to exploring this 
medium in a way that is hardly going to fur­
ther their cause? Three reasons: the insistent 
following of “evil” bands; the rise of glam 
bands that were more show than music; and 
the increasing popularity of heavy metal.
Black Sabbath and Bloodrock were two 
of the first “questionable” bands, categoriz­
ed as such mainly because of their names. 
Sabbath’s thick instrumentals and heavy 
lyrics (especially in the Ozzy Osbourne days) 
attracted many critics seeking some remnant 
of the sixties counter-culture to condemn. 
They still carry something of a stigma, 
despite anti-war and anti-drugs songs (“War 
Pigs” and “Hand of Doom”) and pro- 
Christian songs (“After Forever”).
W'hile not the first band to wear make­
up, members of Kiss are the founders of the 
modern stage show. Their sets have includ­
ed a drum rostrum shaped as ^ huge tank 
(complete with movable gun turret) and in­
credible pyrotechnics. Their music is un­
complicated ~basic rock and roll with some 
extra guitar thrown in —but their elaborate 
make-up and secret personalities establish­
ed an increasingly popular precedent.
Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin were the 
monster groups of the seventies. But while 
this heavy blues/heavy rock style is a metal 
foundation, the first of the “new breed” was 
Judas Priest. Rather than use one guitarist 
or a guitarist and a keyboardist, Priest 
employed two axemen for more crunch. 
Though their earliest music is slightly bluesy, 
by Sad Wings of Destiny, they had developed 
a very distinct sound : solid guitars,
Halford’s growls-to-shrieks vocals, power 
chords, and a confident, almost pompous 
air.
While these three factors describe the 
musical atmosphere of the late seventies 
some more social factors are also relevant 
The punk movement with its f--- this and 
f--- that mentality was firmly entrenched in 
British society, while in America, fundamen­
talist groups were finding back masking in 
Led Zeppelin albums and condemning rock 
music in general.
The punks, of course, almost immediate­
ly set up the counter punks, and thus came 
the New Wave of British Heavy Metal 
(N.W.O.B.H.M.). It was indeed something 
of a metal renaissance, but this time, the 
music sounded more like Priest than Pur­
ple. Saxon, Def Leppard, Tygers of Ty Pan 
Krokus and Trust first established themselves 
in this era.
The most successful of the N.W.O.B.H.M. 
bands has been Iron Maiden. Like Black 
Sabbath, they have been falsely accused of 
having satanistic leanings. While primary 
song writer Steve Harris does have a 
predeliction for gothic/occultish themes, 
most of Maiden’s material deals with books, 
movies, short stories, poetry, and per­
sonalities (“criminal minds” and prostitutes). 
They have been criticized for “Number of 
the Beast,” a song not promoting devil wor­
ship, but telling of the terror of cults.
But the precedent was set. If hard and fast 
music was taboo, and if religious themes 
were off limits, then undoubtedly they would 
be used. And abused. Venom and Mercyful 
Fate are but the tip of the satanic metal 
iceberg. They have seen the most success 
because they have enough musical content 
to overshadow their shallow gimmick.
Yes, gimmick. Though King Diamond, 
lead singer for Fate, claims to he a satanist, 
he breaks several rules common to such 
cults, the first and foremost of which is

March 5, 1985—The Tartan—Page 15
New releases show diverse musical themes
By MARK ISKOWITZ
Special to The Tartan
1. The Smiths — Meat Is Murder (Sire)
The long-awaited second Smith’s studio
album is here. Punchier songs dominate this 
group-produced work, which has a folkier 
sound due to Morrissey’s Pete Seeger-like 
vocal delivery and Johnny Marr’s crisp, com­
plementary acoustic strumming. While 
Morrissey may still be “miserable,” his new 
material also ventures successfully out of his 
tiny room to the turbulence of Britain’s 
youth culture (“Rusholme Ruffians”) and to 
controversies surrounding cruelty to animals 
"Meat is Murder”). Marr’s instrumentation 
has expanded to include more varied guitar 
sound, piano, and eerie mood layering. As 
a bonus, “How Soon Is Now?,” the Bo- 
Diddley-inspired masterpiece, was a last 
minute addition.
2. Jason and the Scorchers — Lost and 
Found (EMI)
These Nashville boys demonstrate the art 
of rockin’ which roots country elements with 
unparalleled emotion and kinetics. Jason 
Ringenberg’s self-penned tunes smell of 
Gene Vincent heroism and Hank Williams 
romanticism. His harmonica blows full 
steam ahead, and the natural melancholy 
he evokes makes one feel on “Broken 
Whiskey Glass” and “Still Tied” is almost 
cathartic. Considering rockabilly’s stagna­
tion, it may just be the ideal time for this 
kind of “rockin’ country” music to emerge 
as a dominant force in contemporary music.
3. Yello — Stella (Elektra)
Yello, the Swiss-based art funk group has 
basically continued and expanded the 
musical territory explored on 1983’s You Got­
ta Say Yes To Another Excess. Dieter Meier’s 
vocals are wilder than ever, and a soulful 
female soloist named Rush Winers gets the 
nod on two cuts, most notable the current
dance single, “Vicious Games.” Boris Blank’s 
arrangements move into orchestral areas and 
later into electro-funk, noise, and jazz 
motifs. This fourth studio LP is their finest, 
collecting the diverse elements of Yello’s 
sound to create a complete picture.
4. Ronald Shannon Jackson — Decode 
Yourself (Island)
With his talented and versatile group, the 
Decoding Society, Jackson hits the drums 
with his usual extraordinary passion and
controlled pace. As a veteran of modem and 
avant-garde jazz, he doesn’t hesitate to break 
barriers in music, especially those which 
separate jazz from rock and funk. Bill 
Laswell, for years an underrated musi­
cian/producer whose talents are now in 
great demand, adds precision and even some 
computer drum programming to Jackson’s 
sound. The nine largely instrumental pieces 
sizzle with a live, spontaneous quality, spark­
ed by guitarist Vernon Reid and violinist 
Akbar Ali.
Butthole Surfers — Another Man’s Sac 
(Touch and Go)
San Antonio’s slightly warped and always 
exciting Butthole Surfers have come up with 
a surprisingly mixed bag. Ranging from evil 
pop to jazz skank, the music never fails to 
knock you over the head, and the lyrics prey 
on society’s hypocrites with honest disgust. 
The sound quality is leagues ahead of their 
two previous LPs. Studio tricks and weird 
processing play a major role in creating ap­
propriate moods for each song.
Witness an impressive, captivating film
By BRUCE KASREL
Tartan Staffwriter
Television and newspaper ads about the 
new movie Witness may give you the impres­
sion that this is yet another police story, but 
this is misleading. This is a dramatic story 
of forbidden love that deals more with the 
cultural barriers between the worlds of the 
rural Amish community and the urban 
Philadelphia.
While visiting Philadelphia, a young 
Amish boy, Samuel (Lakas Haas), witnesses 
a brutal murder. A tough homocide detec­
tive, John Book (Harrison Ford) , takes on 
the case and soon learns too much. Fleeing 
for his life, as well as the boy’s, Book makes 
a home in Samuel’s village. Soon a relation­
ship develops between Book and Samuel’s 
mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis), and the 
movie shifts gears from a fast-paced cops- 
and-robbers story to an endearing love story. 
Once inside the quaint village, Book must
change from a hard-nose cop to a soft 
hearted farmer. This social friction provides 
the movie with a light, humorous tone. 
There is one particularly delightful scene 
where the entire village — including Book
— erect a barn for a newly married couple. 
Through such impressive moments as this, 
Witness really gives a feeling of what life in 
Amish country is like. Since the bulk of the 
movie is devoted to exploring the Amish 
theme, the police end of the story is weak 
and exists only to supply the movie with a 
setting and the requisite action scenes.
Harrison Ford breaks out of his 
swashbuckling Indiana Jones — Han Solo 
image and gives a fine performance, show­
ing his versatility as an actor. You can really 
feel Book’s frustration at not being able to 
touch the bad guys, as well as his love for 
Rachel. The homey, yet attractive, Kelly 
McGillis delivers an outstanding perfor­
mance by showing that Rachel’s love for 
Book is deep enough to make her give up 
her way of life for him. Because of the fine 
acting on the part of just about everyone, 
and the scenic beauty of rural Pennsylvania, 
Witness is a very impressive and captivating 
film.
Although Witness does not fit tightly into 
the mold of either a love story or a police 
story, it does have fine displays of each. It’s 
subtle charm and an interesting plot add up 
to make Witness a very pleasant trip to the 
theatre.

While the satanic/occult themes are at­

rawest, most powerful band in modern 
history, has completely avoided this nonsense 
as well. A band can sell without it — the

March 5, 1985—The Tartan—Page 17
"Lei 'em Build Their Kingdom"is disappointing
By ANTHONY A. DATRI
¦fortan Entertainment Editor
This Saturday evening saw the presenta­
tion in the Ballroom of “Let ’em Build Their 
kingdom,” a multimedia presentation led by 
William David Romanowski. The intent of 
the show was to show “the development of 
popular music by highlighting the social, 
political and cultural events that distinguish­
ed the climate of the times.”
The show opened with a taped discourse 
about World War II, which (together with 
slides the familiar Hiroshima pictures) tried 
t0 get the audience’s attention, but only 
resulted in confusing the remainder of the 
presentation. The show then proceeded with 
alternating sequences of Romanowski 
delivering emotional descriptions of the
musical/social/political climate of the past 
thirty years with musical interludes.
More than half of these musical segments 
consisted of Romanowski delivering impres­
sions of famous musicians, with varying suc­
cess. His Stevie Wonder and Beatles were a 
tad disappointing, but his rendition as Bob 
Dylan of “Like a Rolling Stone” was rather 
inspiring.
Although most of Romanowski’s material 
seemed well researched and thought out, his 
insight into the music of recent years (the 
seventies) showed some inconsistencies and 
lack of depth. During the two minutes he 
devoted to misrepresenting heavy metal 
(which seemed to mean anything since 1970 
with an eiectric guitar in it) Romanowski 
played a tape of Judas Preist’s version of “The
Green Manalishi with the Iwo-Pronged 
Crown.” After ripping on this type of music 
(something he had done to no other) he then 
performed a medley of “Soft Rock”—Stevie 
Wonder, Barry Manilow, and Fleetwood 
Mac.
This was all fine and dandy, but I almost 
laughed at the irony, since Fleetwood Mac 
had themselves written and performed 
“Manalishi” several years before. Another 
misjudgement that struck me was the almost 
total disregard of Jimi Hendrix. 
Romanowski’s tribute to the greatest musi 
cian of the century was limited to an unin
formed mention of his death in 1970 (he im­
plied that it was suicide) and a slide, which 
was taken from the cover of a bootleg 
album.
The press release for this “extravaganza’ 
claims that the show answers questions such 
as “Why were students shot at Kent State and 
Jackson State in 1970?” and “Is ‘the Fonz’ 
really typical of the 50’s?” but fails to answer 
them. Although the format aspired to by this 
show has strong potential, “Let ’em Build 
Their Kingdom” ends up falling somewhere 
between Kasey Kasem arid Nova. Perhaps 
a good summary of this presentation is sug-

Jack Sheffler, a senior painter, exhibits 
I large, figurative works, mostly of factories in 
I the Pittsburgh area. Sheffler frequently 
[paints from black and white photographs 
[which he has taken. Subsequently, the col- 
lors Sheffler employs on the canvas are en- 
Itirely “colors out of my head.”
I use colors I like to make the paintings 
[work,” said Sheffler. “Instead of just a gray 
[factory, I add color to make it more in­
teresting.” Most of Sheffler’s paintings are ex­
ecuted in bright pastels.
Sheffler uses acrylic paint and rollers to 
|lay down his initial, larger shapes, then 
[details the work in oils. “One of the most im­
portant aspects of my work is simply the 
[nandling of the paint,” said Sheffler.
Senior painting and illustration major 
[Renee Smith exhibits work in a variety of 
[media. The inspiration for Smith’s work fre­
quently relies on the ability of her imagina­
tion to change a given image.
“A piece may start out formalistic,” said 
Smith, “and then I use my imagination to 
change what’s already there.”
Smith enjoys letting the shapes do the 
work for her, making frequent use of the 
primary colors and strong, simple shapes to 
create her images. “My work isn’t necessari­
ly figurative,” said Smith, “but shape is still 
important.”
“Environment is a lot of how I react, a lot 
of where my imagery comes from,” said 
Smith. In one painting, The Meeting Place, 
Smith depicts two abstract figures coming 
together. “It’s an instance of a fantasy,” said 
Smith,, “a circumstance in my mind that I 
changed around.”

By PHILIP VERDIECK
Tartan Staffwriter
Phil Collins, lead singer and longtime 
drummer of Genesis has just put out another 
solo album. Entitled No Jacket Required, 
this album follows in the wake of his suc­
cessful collaboration with Philip Bailey in 
the single “Easy Lover.” Songs from his 
album, like “One More Night,” are already 
receiving plenty of promotional airplay 
throughout the nation.
The album consists of five songs on each 
side, with Phil Collins providing the lead and 
backup vocals, and playing the drums, bass, 
keyboards and Roland percussion machines 
throughout most of the album. An assort­
ment of other musicians provide the sax­
ophone, guitar, horn and backup vocal 
work. Among these is Peter Gabriel, who is 
presently working on an album of his own, 
and Sting of The Police.
Side one begins with “Sussudio,” a 
multifaceted arrangement in which Phil’s 
voice is contrasted with the rhythmic pat­
tern of the Roland drum machine combin­
ed with the trumpeting horns. “Sussudio” is
an entertaining song but other works on this 
side are better. The next piece, “Only You 
Know and I Know,” comes across stronger 
and livelier than its predecessor. The guitar 
rhythms and keyboard work help create an 
enchanting tempo which support Phil’s vocal 
performance well.
One of the best songs of the first side is 
“Long Long Way to Go.” In this song, which 
seems to lament the sad fact of man’s inabili­
ty to coexist peacefully with his fellows, Sting 
can be heard singing the backup vocals. This 
contribution, combined with Phil’s ranging 
vocals, separates this song from the rest of 
the album. The next piece, “I Don’t W'ant 
To Know” features Phil wailing the title for 
the most part, but the strong lead guitar, 
bass guitar and drums help to create a 
listenable melody. Phil wraps up this side of 
the album with “One More Night.” In this 
arrangement the softer, clearer tones of Phil’s 
voice come across much better when com­
bined with gentle violin strains and a jazzlike 
saxophone.

Side two jumps right into the catchy 
rhythms of “Don’t Lose My Number.” This 
song is reminiscent of “I Don’t Care 
Anymore” and “In the Air Tonight,” in the 
almost tangible energy which these songs 
emanate. The melange of fantastic vocals, 
Phil’s drumming, and excellent guitar, all 
laid on top of a lively programmed drum 
pattern create a fast tempo which is main­
tained throughout the song. This is one of 
the album’s high points. The following work, 
“Who Said I Would,” is one of the album’s 
worst songs. Although Phil does an ad­
mirable job of singing and at times the dif­
fering sub-rhythms are quite interesting, the 
repetitious opening horn sequence remerges 
several times through the song and becomes 
quite tiresome. Fortunately the next piece, 
“Doesn’t Anybody Stay Together Anymore,” 
is quite superior. This song is an inquiry in­
to the lack of depth present in human rela­
tions. The superb keyboards and drumming 
underline Phil’s fine vocals. In the follow­
ing song, “Inside Out,” Phil laments the ac­
tions and advising of others who try to mold 
our behavior to their own standards. Along 
with Phil’s vocals, strong guitar and drum­
ming make this arrangement one more of 
the album’s pluses.
“Take Me Home,” the last song of the 
album, features both Sting and Peter
Gabriel on backing vocals. The tumultuous 
tempo of this piece, which tends to build and 
then fall repeatedly, provides an excellent 
supporting rhythm for the vocals.
Once again, Collins has managed to 
satisfy his ego by gracing the album cover 
with a large photograph of his face. His ego 
also manifests itself in his tendency to rely 
occasionally too heavily on his vocal talents. 
On the whole though, this album is a fine 
work.

CMU Tartans took to the ice Sun- 
to open the Western Penn Collegiate 
Association (WPCHA) playoffs, 
themselves matched against the
Panthers.
Tartans had faced the Panthers 
season, losing both meetings, 
free-skating game, which attempts 
a physical game, was tested by 
very physical attack. But CMU rose 
[the challenge, and after 24 penalty 
utes had been served by both teams, 
Tartans had four dents in the Pitt goal 
in, 4-3-
t opened the scoring at 12:53 of the 
period. Damon Brown scored the 
er play goal when he took the re­
nd off a Roger Oldaker shot. The 
k bounced off Tartan goalie Bob 
akowski and had just left the crease 
n Brown put it home behind 
kowski’s legs. Brown’s goal was the 
scorer of the first period. Paul Russo

scored.
took a 2-0 lead at 5:56 of the se- 
period. Kurt Stetzer took the puck 
Marc Bowers and beat Kosakowski 
his glove hand through a screen on 
ipshot from the left point. CMU then 
tered with four unanswered within 
minutes.
ie Tartans ended Pitt’s bid for a 
nit with a power play goal at 7:01. 
Spray took a pass from captain Tim 
iy along the goal line and scored on 
ection off Pitt goalie John Godwin, 
minute-and-thirty-seconds later, Bob 
beat Godwin on a rebound from a 
shot. The goal came just two 
ds into a Pitt penalty for the second 
power play goal of the game.
Bob Koch looks to score in recent 13-0 win over Bethany.
Russo continued the onslaught when 
he put a Rob Katz rebound past Godwin 
for the third tally at 11:33. The Tartans 
ended their scoring binge at 13:58, an 
unassisted goal by Sean McGinn. McGinn 
took the puck behind his own blue line 
and made an end-to-end rush. His shot re­
bounded off Godwin’s blocker and into 
the top corner of the net. The Tartans out- 
shot Pitt 17-3 in the second period.
Pitt pulled within one at 6:09 of the 
third period when right wing Frank
Lucido put the puck past Kosakowski after 
a battle for the puck in front of the net.
The final nine minutes were very 
physical. Pitt could smell victory and they 
worked hard. The Panthers pulled God­
win for an extra attacker with 1:10 left in 
the game, but the Tartan defense, led by 
Kenny and key face-off work by Spray, 
held them off.
The attitude was set early by 
Kosakowski when he pulled into the 
Lakevue Ice Palace parking lot singing to

the song “I Want to Rock.” “Koz” was 
very boisterous in goal and helped set the 
tempo of the game. He stopped 23 of 26 
shots he faced. Godwin also turned in a 
supreme performance in the Pitt goal.

wos part of the national qualifying relay teams.
Amidst great personal performance and 
dropped times swam by the entire team 
were those times set by national qualifiers 
Steve Francis, Rob Summers, Mike Fit­
zgerald, and Whitney Foster. Having 
already qualified in the 100-yard freestyle 
at a February 2 home meet, Francis swam 
a qualifying time for 21.79 seconds in the 
50-yard freestyle on Thursday.
As a team, Francis, Summers, Fitzgerald, 
and Foster qualified for nationals in the 
400-yard medley relay, the 800-yard 
freestyle relay, and the 400-yard freestyle 
relay, taking second, first, and second 
places consecutively. All will be attending 
the NCAA Championships held in Atlan­
ta, Georgia on March 14-16.
The three relay times broke CMU 
school records, along with a John Caroll 
pool record for the 800-yard freestyle 
relay. Francis not only broke his own 
CMU records in the 50-yard, 100-yard, and 
200-yard freestyle swims, but brought 
down President’s Athletic Conference 
(PAC) records in the 100-yard and 200-yard 
freestyle events.
Competition among the PAC teams was 
quite stringent, with Grove City and 
JohnCarroll taking first and second places 
respectively over CMU by small and near­
ly equal point-spreads. CMU had swim­
mers placing in the top three in many 
events.
Francis, a sophomore, took second in 
the 50-yard freestyle, First in 200-yard 
freestyle, and first in the 100-yard 
freestyle, with a time of 47.08 seconds. 
Also highlighted was Fitzgerald, swimm­
ing to second place in the 500-yard
freestyle and 100-yard breaststroke events. 
Foster came in second under Francis in 
the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 
1:45.7, missing the national qualifying 
time by only three-tenths of a second. In 
the 100-yard backstroke and 1650-yard 
freestyle or “mile swim,” Summers strok­
ed to third place finishes.
Beyond these well-recognized perfor­
mances were many hard-earned personal 
bests and lowered times, the results of 
dedicated efforts that began last semester 
and continued six days a week, ending at 
the Championships. Jim Morris, Chris 
Leach (team co-captain), Carl Bell, and 
Doug Biesecker all had races in which 
they placed in the top twelve. “Even 
when people didn’t win points, the team 
cheered for them,” said swimmer Patty II- 
lig of the unified swim team spirit.
CMU divers Mark Flanagan and Carol 
Freund were a significant part of the 
team’s outstanding showing as well. 
Flanagan ended his college diving career 
with a third place in the three-meter and 
a fifth in the one-meter events, while 
Freund began her PAC tourney career 
with a respectable seventh place for both. 
According to Flanagan, there was much 
more competition in diving, with 20 
divers as opposed to close to ten in the 
past.
Team members agree that it was a good 
meet for everybody. Patty Iliig expressed 
the mood of the championships by say­
ing, “It brought the teams together ... 
people were cheering for other teams to 
qualify for nationals ... it brought our 
own team close together again.”

Taormina hits buzzer 
shot to beat Bethany
By CHRISTOPHER D. LEWIS
Tartan Sports Editor
Two years ago, CMU was involved in a 
five-overtime game with Allegheny Col­
lege. Skibo Gym may never see a game as 
thrilling as that one, but Friday’s game 
against Bethany definitely rivalled it.
As the buzzer sounded to end the game 
and the season, senior John Taormina, 
after bouncing off two Bethany Bison 
players, sank a 14-foot fadeaway jumper 
to defeat the Bisons, 59-57.
The victory gave CMU sole possession 
of second place in the Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference, their highest finish since 
1978-79. The 7-5 conference mark is their 
best since 1980-81, and the 9-13 overall 
record is the best finish since a 10-11 mark 
in 1981-82. The Tartans finished four 
games behind W&J in the PAC (W&J lost 
to the University of Scranton Friday night 
in the first round of the Division III 
playoffs, 84-75).
Taormina, who finished with 16 points 
to lead CMU, had just two points on 1-5 
shooting in the first half, which CMU 
came out of trailing 30-21. Frank 
Yankovich scored 12 of his 21 points in 
the opening 20 minutes, and Mike Kemp 
had 12 rebounds for the Bisons.
The Tartans came out shooting straight 
in the second half. Taormina was 7-8 in 
the half, the final minutes of his basket­
ball career, for 14 points. George Debski 
scored all 12 of his points off the bench 
in the second half. Kemp was held to just 
two rebounds.
Freshman Hart Coleman, named PAC 
co-rookie of the year, had 13 points and 
17 rebounds for CMU. Coleman has a 
bright future as an inside force for the
Tartans.
It was a game that seemed endless. 
CMU came back quickly after the first 
half, but could not build a string lead. For 
the last eight minutes, Tech and the Bisons 
traded leads, with no team ever ahead by 
more than four points.
This went on until the game was tied, 
57-57, with 20 seconds left, and CMU had 
possession. They had controlled the ball 
with 1:34 remaining, and held the ball for 
the last shot, and called time out. Bethany 
had one foul left to give before CMU was 
able to go to the line. Tech worked the ball 
around, looking for a good shot, when 
Bethany fouled with eight seconds left.
The Tartans passed the ball into Rob 
Brown, who got it to Taormina with five 
seconds left. The senior co-captain dribbl­
ed to the top of the key and then drove 
to the basket, pulling up at the foul line 
for the game-winning desperation jumper. 
Taormina said after the game, “I was just 
looking to draw the foul.” No foul was 
called, but CMU had a victory.
Taormina, Dwayne Waite and volunteer 
assistant coach Pete Bennett were 
honored before the game. The loss of 
Taormina and Waite will hurt the Tartans, 
but young players such as Coleman, 
Brown, and Michael Stewart make the 
future look bright for Larry Anderson’s 
team.
Taormina, CMU’s leading scorer, was 
named Tartan Most Valuable Player at a 
reception for family and friends after the 
game. The 6’2” senior from Monaca also 
led the team in field goal percentage and 
free throw percentage.
Coleman was awarded the CMU 
freshman of the year. Tom Franklin’s

Lady Tartans lose to 
W&J in PAC tournament
By PAUL MASALSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
In what has been a very successful year 
for CMU athletics, the 4-12 record of the 
women’s basketball team may seem 
disappointing.
At the end of the season, however, there 
emerged a competitive attitude among 
the players that was a step in the right 
direction. The Lady Tartans showed a long 
awaited winning desire in posting vic­
tories in three of their last six games. CMU 
was eliminated in the first round of the 
PWC tournament by second place 
Washington and Jefferson, a team they 
had almost beaten in overtime during the 
regular season.
Coach Gerri Seidl was impressd with 
these efforts, but she was also looking for 
her team to pull out victories in the close 
contests.
“I didn’t think the girls really believed 
they could win,” commented Seidl. “If 
they had a little more confidence in 
themselves, we might have finished 
higher in the league standings.”
Co-captain Michelle Schlegel agrees. “I 
think we lacked confidence as a team, but 
found this confidence at the end of the 
season. It was a transition year, adjusting 
to a new coach and a lot of new players, 
and it wasn’t until late that things started 
to click.”
In the first round of the tournament, 
CMU staged a repeat performance of what 
plagued them throughout the season. Un­
til the final three minutes of the game, the 
Tartans trailed by a mere three points. 
They were unable to generate enough 
energy to pull ahead, and W&J eventual­
ly won the game, 50-41.
CMU used the full court press 
throughout the game to make up for a
considerable height disadvantage. Val 
Sooky and Nancy Dilulio exploited W&J’s 
weak ball-handlers by forcing several tur­
novers at half court. On the offensive end, 
Laurie Arendas pured in 13 points in a 
high scoring effort.
Washington and Jefferson eventually 
went on to the championship contest, 
where they suffered a brutal 13 point loss 
to league champion Thiel.
Plagued with a height disadvantage 
throughout the year, CMU was forced to 
rely on the quickness of the guards to 
make up for a lack of rebounding. Often, 
the Lady Tartans would only get one shot 
at the basket for every time down the 
floor.
“Our size was a big disadvantage,” re­
marked Schlegel. “It was frustrating 
challenging bigger players for rebounds 
and not coming down with them. We 
often had to work much harder than the 
opposition to stay in the game.”
CMU will lose Arendas, Schlegel and 
Maria Bober, a 5-9 forward, to graduation. 
All will be surely missed. Coach Seidl will 
by trying to develop freshmen prospects 
Monica Zalevsky and Vivian Braxton, 
whose height and rebounding ability will 
be valued in upcoming seasons.
“Next year we will be recruiting players, 
which should increase our production,” 
said Seidl. “We’ve improved our running 
game greatly, now we need to establish 
power inside.”
The guard positions for next season are 
solid, with sophomore sensation Val 
Sooky and junior point guard Nancy 
Dilulio returning. Forwards Cheryl 
Houser and Christine Munn should also 
figure prominently in the next stage of im­
provement for the squad.
We are proud to announce that
The Mannes College of Music
has moved to splendid new quarters 
on Manhattan's west side.

outcome of the game. “The ball was im­
possible to scoop. I kept picking up mud.”
The Tartans improved their record to 
2—0 when they defeated West Virginia by 
a score of 6—5. WVU was the first to 
score in this highly aggressive game. CMU 
was not on the scoreboard until the se­
cond quarter when John Rentzepis scored 
off an assist by Heiser. Later in the quarter 
Teresky scored to end the half with CMU 
trailing 3—2.
CMU came back with three goals in the 
third quarter. Two were by Adrian Van 
Stalk and the third by Rickert. Two of 
these were with assists by Teresky.
Cohen feels that CMU is “definitely a 
second half team.
The fourth quarter was tense and 
especially violent, with two WVU goals 
and one by CMU by Bruce Theodorson 
with another assist from Teresky. The final 
score was 6—5. The team is especially ex­
cited about this victory because WVU 
recently beat Slippery Rock, an especial­
ly tough team, which makes them more 
optimistic about their confrontation with 
SRU.
The Tartans play again at home on Fri­
day against St. Vincent’s at 4:00 p.m.

March 5, 1985—The Tartan—Page 27
low coverage hurts Pittsburgh sports
AIbaLr,Hinha ly sh2Lr
Sports Editor
recent days, a Hamilton, Ontario 
.paper has published reports saying 
[the Pittsburgh Penguins are moving 
at Canadian city. This has been 
denied by everyone, and is 
probably just a false rumor.
Nobody is denying that the 
Pittsburgh Pirates future in 
flsylvania is unknown at best. Atten- 
; has been poor, despite a winning 
j in Pittsburgh until last year, 
nd although some would call the 
a joke of a league, this supposed 
[ball city could not come close to sup- 
[ing a franchise here, 
thy is this downfall happening in this 
(number-one rated city in America? 
the exception of beloved steeler, 
in Pittsburgh have had trouble 
Lcially. Is it poor teams? In the Peguins 
perhaps, but before last year the
Pirates were perennial contenders.
The problem is in relation with the 
teams. In most cities, when a fan can’t get 
out to the game, he can watch his team 
on television most of the time. Either on 
cable or on public TV, you can see “your 
team” often enough to keep up with the 
club from week to week or day to day. 
People relate better to their home teams 
by seeing what’s going on a TV viewer 
gets excited about the team, and decides 
it is worth the money to go out and see 
the players perform.
This type of chain reaction will not 
happen in Pittsburgh. With the Steel City 
being for the most part a blue-collar town, 
cable TV is not the answer. People can­
not affort the hook-ups. In recent years, 
a majority of Pirate games and a number 
of pens games were broadcast on cable. 
However, with the folding of the Home 
Sports Entertainment (HSE) network, no 
games will be on cable this year.
But most of the games will not be 
shown on any network, although all the 
games are broadcast on radio. We, the 
fans, are afforded little opportunity to see 
the team play when they are away from 
the Pittsburgh area.
According to a represenative of the 
Civic Areana Corporation (CAC), which 
runs the Pens, just 15 of the 40 road games 
are coveded on WPGH-TV (channel 53), 
and no home games. Over half of the road 
games are not televised at all.
For the Pirates, KDKA-TV (channel two) 
will televise just 36 of 162 games during 
the 1985 season, according to Sally 
O’Leary of the Pirate Public Relations 
Department. In the 1983 season, HSE had 
50 Pirate games while KDKA covered a 
sparse schedule of games.
It is a common belief that increased TV 
time will decrease attendance due to fans 
sitting in their homes watching games. 
But TV games are the best promotional
devices a team can have. What better way 
to show case your team than to see them 
in action, the Pirates should be con­
tenders following what Bill Modlock call­
ed last year’s “nightmare”. But when they 
leave Pittsburgh, we will have no way to 
see them progress, except for 36 of 81 
games.
These teams should work toward bet­
ter contracts with local networks. The 
networks should realize that televised 
games should bring good ratings locally 
in this sports town. Personally, I’m 
looking forward to an exciting end to the 
hockey season, and I would like to see the 
Pens young players progress, at home and 
on the road. And the Pirates aren’t in 
town, I’ll miss them, because I won’t be 
able to see them. Radio sports just isn’t as 
good as TV sports.

joring in Professional Writing and «The

Editorial.
"Professional study and work is so preoccupying that unless the ability 
to deal with human and social problems is grafted into the strong tree 
of professional growth, the effects of humanistic and social courses, no 
matter how well taught, will be likely to wither from lack of nourishment 
or become a more decorative mistletoe ... Only if general education 
is so united with professional education that it teaches students to apply 
their professional aptitude and skill to handling human and social pro­
blems, will professional graduates be equipped to do their share in 
meeting the problems of society."
— Elliott Dunlap Smith 
Provost, Carnegie lech, 1948
The Office of Academic Affairs has set the ball rolling on 
what may be remembered as the most important step that 
Carnegie-Mellon University ever took: the establishment of 
a University-wide Core curriculum. The Core, no matter what 
form it eventually takes, is sure to have a great impact on 
the campus.
The new curriculum is based on the Carnegie Plan of the 
1940s, which set a precedent, when implemented at Carnegie 
Tech, among engineering schools: it integrated a substan­
tial liberal arts program into an engineering curriculum for 
the first time anywhere. The Carnegie Plan, however, was 
designed to meet the specifications of a technical institute; 
when lech became CMU in 1967, the school's primary goal 
changed. In order to live up to its newly-adopted title, CMU 
had to be able to educate not only engineers and fine-arts 
students, but liberal-arts students as well.
lb better provide a "liberal/professionaT education, CMU 
invented the College of Humanities and Social Sciences 
(H&SS). At first, H&SS met with marginal success; as late 
as 1976, a Thrtan editorial commented on die apparent failure 
of the "promising experimental college,* considering H&SS 
to be still *on the drawing board* as a solution to unifying 
the school's academics. Today, although H&SS has made 
great strides in establishing its reputation nationally as a 'pro­
fessional' liberal-arts school, it has unfortunately become just 
¿mother independent bastion of learning in an institution 
already to compartmentalized for its own good.
And that is CMlTs fundamental problem right now. 
Everyone does his own thing, and could not care less about 
what his fellow student or faculty member is doing. We do 
not attend a '"University/ but a 'Diversity.*
So how would it be best to solve this problem? How to get 
people to look at each other, to work together more often? 
How to get people to think about more than their own, chan­
neled specializations?
Tfou guessed it. The Core curriculum.
The Core, contrary to popular belief, will not simply mean 
"more reuqired bulls—t courses and fewer free electives.* 
Rather, it will complement, if not largely replace, the 
independently-developed cores of the undergraduate col­
leges. It will strive to create an individual course of study 
which will get the average student to see and understand 
better the whole scheme of things — what AVP Achembaum 
so fondly calls *the big picture.' The Core will bring together 
faculty members who find themselves teaching unique con­
cepts to students which combine their previously "unrelated' 
interests.
More importantly, the implementation of the Core will not 
mean that the quality of the CMU graduate will go down. 
A more subtle, and dangerous, fallacy circling campus is 
that, because students must take more Core courses, they 
must give up a few senior-level courses which would have 
honed their knowledge and skills to the high standards for 
which industry and the job market look. Students will sup­
posedly be more well-rounded, but they won't get jobs. 'CMU 
fills a niche—it provides high-quality technical training like 
few other schools can,' the fallacy says.
But CMU is no longer Carnegie lech. The same issue of 
the 1976 Tartan lambasted the ''misconception that profes­
sional education is any training which enables the student 
to easily find a job upon graduation. The problem [with this 
view] is that [it] is indistinguishable from vocational train­
ing.* CMU may lose that niche in trying to unify its in­
disputably superb resources but it can only rise to a higher 
level of excellence with the Core.
As former Provost Smith said, students must be able *to 
apply their professional aptitude and skill to handling human 
and social problems.* The key word is apply. Virtually every 
major at CMU is "applied*: engineering, for example, is 'ap­
plied science*; architecture is 'applied design.* With a 
coherent, well-thought-out plan to condense the required 
courses into a useful tool for thought, CMU will begin to 
graduate every student with a double major: the student's 
own, and a degree in 'applied knowledge.*
Core curriculum is what will enable CMU to leave behind 
its tnhnir-al legacy and become a true, diverse university.

Molly Moriarty: In memoriam
On behalf of Molly’s parents 
and six brothers, we would like 
to extend our gratitude for your 
kindness and concern 
throughout what has doubtless­
ly been the most trying times 
our family has ever face. We 
feel the need however, to cor­
rect some of the misconcep­
tions surrounding the cir­
cumstances of Molly’s tragic 
death.
The early reports issued 
February 24 said that Molly had 
apparently taken her own life. 
To her family and close friends, 
the reports were unacceptable. 
Anyone who knew Molly realiz­
ed that there must have been a 
mistake, that a girl who lived 
her life with such passion and 
vigor at one moment would 
hardly have thrown it away in 
the next. We understand from 
the coroner that Molly’s death 
was indeed an accident, the
culmination of a few minor, but 
collectively lethal conditions.
As her friends will attest, Mol­
ly was a person who could be 
classified as a non-drinker. On 
the evening of February 23, she 
did have 2 or 3 beers during the 
course of the CMU Beaux Arts 
Ball. Upon returning home 
from her date in the early mor­
ning, she took a dosage of sleep­
ing tablets. She had had beer on 
some occasions, and sleeping 
tablets on other occasions. 
Never, though, had she taken 
both concurrently. She pro­
bably didn’t know their com­
bination would produce a dead­
ly mixture. According to the 
coroner, a dosage of no more 
than two or three tablets, com­
bined with alcohol, produced 
that mixture.
She awoke with an upset 
stomach three full hours after 
going to bed, which
demonstates that it wasi 
matter of her system 
worn down rather than a! 
assault. Her death can 
tributed to a lack of undei 
ding about the effects of vaj 
chemicals on her body.
Again, speaking for allc 
ly’s family, we hope youa 
the opportunity to expert 
the happiness that Molly j 
bring into any roofl| 
entered. Like a shootii 
Molly had given us aglii 
universal beauty, our 
tion to greatness. We 
you will agree that the lig 
ly has brought into <

.O.S.: Central America
ackground to the strile in El Salvador
RICHARD HONRATH, CARLOS
OZAYA-GOROSTIZA, and RENE 
BANARES ALCANTARA
jn our last column,we described the 
orbing of civilans in El Salvador, 
espouses to this news vary from anger 
nd astonishment to justifcation based on 
e fact that some acts are necessary in 
me of war. The strength of interest in an 
sue is important, but its duration is even 
ore so. We have witnessed how our own 
terests have moved with the news from 
fghanistan to Ethiopia to the Middle East, 
ossibly because the isolated facts we 
/ere exposed to did not give us enough 
nderstanding of the situation as a whole. 
We have been asked for what reason we 
e interested in El Salvador in particular, 
hile struggles and deaths are occurring 
oughout the world. To answer this 
uestion, we will not limit this column to 
statement of current news of Central 
merica, but will attempt to look at the 
asic causes of the conflict.
Conditions in El Salvador are similar to 
ose in most countries of Latin America, 
uge differences exist between various 
rtions qf the population:
92% of the population owns 60% of 
eland.
• 50% of the population earns less
than $200.00/year, and is unemployed 8 
months of the year.
• more than 70 • of all rural children 
suffer from malnutrition.
This situation is not a recent develop­
ment. From 1913 to 1931, during the Quinonez-Melendez dynasty, similar or 
worse conditions existed. Conditions in 
Mexi co at that time lead to the Mexican 
revolution of 1910-1917. In El Salvador, workers and peasants began to unify 
themselves in an organization called the 
Workers Regional of El Salvador, which 
gained 75,000 members. Free elections 
were held in January 1931, raising the 
promise of reform. The new president, 
oppossed by agricultural interests and 
the military, was killed by the army in- 
December. The result was a popular in­
surrection in January 1932, which was 
crushed by the arm under Gen. Max­
imiliano Hernzndez Martinez. Over the 
next few weeks the army killed 30,000 
people, a situation known as La Matan­
zaXas a fraction of the country’s popula­
tion, this is equivalent to a massacre of 
more than 9 million in the U.S. today).
From 1932 until 1979, El Salvador was 
governed by an informal alliance of the 
military with the agricultural and in­
dustrial oligrachy. The military held the
et the farmers produce, let 
he hungry eat
Last week was rich in irony for anyone 
ho cared to notice. A couple of days 
.ter the installation of Edwin Meese, 
hose views on hunger in America are as 
fensive as they are fantastic, as Attorney 
neral, we were presented with the 
ults of a Harvard University study con- 
ding that hunger is epidemic in 
erica. A sideshow to this charming pair 
events was the maneuverings in 
shington over what to do about 
erica’s small farmers inasmuch as they 
fast approaching extinction, 
bviously, either Edwin Meese or Har­
vard University exists in some alternate 
dimension. Although one can never, rule 
out Harvard, nevertheless my money’s on 
You-Know-Who. Aside from this, however, 
at first glance the only appropriate 
response that comes to mind is to echo 
what would undoubtedly be the reaction 
of NBC’s Lloyd Dobins: and so it goes.
While I appreciate the sentiment, I’m 
not in quite so fatalistic a mood. 
Moreover, while I fully appreciate the 
irony of the events of last week, their ut­
ter absurdity compels me to suggest that 
such insanity is not only intolerable, but
office of the president and the politically 
important ministries, while members of 
the oligarchy held those involving 
economic policy. During and before this 
time, the military consolidated its power 
through the creation of security organiza­
tions and paramilitary groups. These in­
cluded the National Guard, National 
Police and the Treasury Police, which 
were created to insure internal order. In 
addtion, the National Guard created 
regional patrols under the command of 
the retired sergeants. More recently, 
another paramilitary group, Civil Defense, 
was created to organized patrols in rural 
battle areas. In 1980, yet another prar- 
military group, ORDEN, was formed at 
the grass-roots level. Its members, and the 
members of other paramilitary groups, are 
not offical members of the military, but 
are given guns and in some cases 
uniforms. These groups, and the even less 
offical “death squads” are commanded by 
middle- and lower- level officers and thus 
are, to some degree, under offical control.
In this period, the patience of the peo­
ple wras exceeded by the continuous 
cruelty and exploitation to which they 
were subjected, with the door of electoral 
change closed by fraud. As a result, arm­
ed opposition to the government began 
to emerge after 1970.
VIEWPOINT:Stuart Shapiro
unnecessary.
First, it seems clear that regardless of 
what anyone in the Reagan Administration 
cares to believe, hunger is an acute and 
growing problem in the shining city on 
a hill. Secondly, we can combat it in a 
manner that benefits not only the hungry, 
but also American farmers and those who 
lose sleep (obviously this category doesn’t 
include the President) over the size of the 
federal deficit. It’s simply a matter of us­
ing one problem to solve another.

In 1979, a coup d'etat led to the 
establishment of the first military-civilian 
junta. Its proposed reforms were block­
ed, however, by the militay and economic 
interests which still held power behind 
the government. One by one, the civilian 
members of the conservative wing of the 
Christian Democratic Party now 
represented by Jose Napoleon Duarte.
Meanwhile, those opposing the regime 
were consolidating their organizations. In 
January 1980, the coordinating Commit­
tee of the Masses (CRM) was formed, com­
prised of groups representing peasants, 
teachers, students, trade unionists and the 
urban working class. A further consolida­
tion in April led to the formation of the 
Democratic Revolutinart Front (FDR). In 
addition to the CRM, the FDR contains 
labor unions representing more than 
100,000 members, the Socail Christian 
Party and the Revolutionary Movement. 
Its is important to note that the FDR in­
cludes members of the first civilan-miltary 
junta, including, for example, Guillermao 
Ungo. Ungo was Darte’s running mate as 
vice president in 19J2, when xhey were 
elected but prevented from taking office 
by electoral fraud, a similar coalition of 
the armed guerrilla forces led to the crea­
tion of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front (FMLN) in October.
We believe that the conflict in El 
Salvador is a result of internal economic 
causes. However, external influences are 
affecting the evolution of the struggle and 
the lives of all those involved. As a con­
tinuation of the background began this 
week, we will address the external forces 
affecting the Salvadorean civil war in our 
next column.Thefatai.

More Core: Implementing the Curriculum
By Prof. W. ANDREW ACHENBAUMSpecial to The TartanThis is the second part of "The University-Wide Core Curriculum, ” a proposal presented by Prof. Achenbaum to all members of the CMU communi­ty last month. The first part was printed in the February 19th issue of 19e 1artan.
“This new curriculum will 
focus on educational tasks... 
which no single college [at 
CMU] can offer alone...”
3. Implementing a University Core 
Curriculum
31. Strategic Assumptions
Having agreed upon the value of 
general-education requirements at CMU, 
we are now developing a university-wide 
curriculum that complements rather than 
replaces the cores that exist in the four 
colleges. This new curriculum will focus 
on educational tasks that need to be pro­
vided for all students, but which no single 
college can offer alone. In some instances, 
all students will engage in common in­
tellectual experiences. Together, they will 
sample rather than survey issues at the 
frontiers at the of knowledge being 
blazed
by researchers and teachers here. At other 
times, students will be able to select from 
a list of options that have been carefully 
coordinated. At still other times, their

freedom of choice will be determined by 
rules set by their major department and 
undergraduate college.
Ultimately, Carnegie-Mellon Univer­
sity will mandate that all students 
demonstrate their competence in apply­
ing fundamental intellectual skills at three 
stages in their undergraduate education. 
In the first year, they will be required to 
fulfill an entry-level writing requirement; 
to demonstrate their familiarity with the 
university’s computing facilities; and to 
take a university-wide course, which 
focuses on the interrelationships among 
science, technology and the liberal arts. 
In the course of their education, they will 
be required to fulfill a minimal set of 
educational requirements designed to 
broaden their intellectual horizons and 
reinforce skills to which they were expos­
ed as freshmen. Before they graduate, 
they must also satisfy an exit-level writing 
requirement and participate in a “pro­
ject” seminar with peers from other 
colleges.
Obviously, such a program cannot be 
implemented overnight. We intend to 
proceed on an incremental basis, ex­
perimenting as we go. We need to build 
grass roots support. High-ranking univer­
sity officials surely cannot inaugurate a 
general-eduacation core by fiat. It is 
highly improbable that an ad-hoc com­
mittee of any size would ever reach total 
agreement on all the particulars. Hence,
we must be prepared to take risks, but 
also need to establish faji.s 
mechanisms at each step so that this v 
ture can incorporate the best intellectual 
and pedagogical advice available on 
campus. To make the university core 
educationally sound as possible, we

in the curriculum development proces 
and broadening its mission so that it cat 
assist faculty members in teaching “cord 
courses. We hope to utilize the resource 
of the Center for the Design of Educa 
tional Computing (CDEC) in develop 
computer-assisted instructional softwan 
Ultimately, we expect the varioi 
“design” centers being established 
CFA, CIT, and elsewhere to play a pan 
this venture. Faculty in GSIA and SUP 
will play a larger role in undergraduate 
struction. [All these are as they should b(

VIEWPOINT: Stuart Shapiro
continued from page 29
Clearly, current food and nutrition pro­
grams are insufficient to cope with hunger 
on as massive a scale as the Harvard study 
indicates. This is especially true if one 
takes program cuts made at the behest of 
the Administration into account. It’s even 
money that demands for significant infu­
sions of funds into these programs will be 
met at the White House with a lot of sym­
pathy and not much else. In this respect, 
the Administration’s hunger policies will 
most likely be a fair match for its farm 
policies. There is, however, a potential 
solution other than simply shoveling in 
more money.
The solution is to inject some sort of 
rationality into our systems of food and 
farm subsidies by linking the two. The 
current system of farm subsidies often 
pays farmers not to produce. When the 
government actually receives something 
for its money as is especially the case with 
dairy price supports, it then spends even 
more (beyond the above-market price it 
paid for the product) to store the stuff. 
Such a deal. Nevertheless, many family 
farms are headed for the auction Jb*lock. 
This is partially a result of the fact that the 
large corporate farms haul in the bulk of 
the subsidies. Many smaller farmers claim 
they could undersell the corporate farms 
if they were on even terms. So let’s try it.
Instead of paying for nothing or over­
paying for something and then paying 
more to store it, maybe the government 
ought to try a more useful arrangement. 
We have an abundance of food and the 
ability to produce even more. We also
have an abundance of hungry D 
who, despite what Mr. Meese might 
did not arrive at the condition vo|y 
ly. Since thses people lack the 
necessary to initiate the approprjate 
sactions in our glorious free market 
government should act as their pu 
ing agent. In other words, pay the f; 
to produce and give the excess tot 
who can’t afford to purchase it 
highly logical relationship.
Obvioulsy it’s not quite that simply 
necessary institutional arrange™ 
would require significant pro 
restructuring. Nevertheless, the be 
line is that the government could 
support farmerts and help fee{j 
hungry at the same time and almos 
tainly for a great deal less money tl 
would spend on separate farm sui 
and food programs.
All of which makes it particularly 
dening to listen to admisistration 
chmen, including Secretary of Agrii 
John Block, solemnly announce tl 
small farmer should in effect bend 
and kiss his ass goodbye along wjj 
ther federal assistance. Equally 
ing is the failure of Democrats 
state Republicans to suggest am 
more constructive than throwing 
money at the problem. And in the 
time, America’s hungry twist slowly 
wind.
