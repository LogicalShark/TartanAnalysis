Easter and the Famous 
Overend’s Scheme 
Strong Pere 
White Overalls
—By ARTHUR WHIZ NG 
THE ANNUAL Easter parade 
brings forth an extraordinary group 
of America's famous. Little col­
lege boys and girls should take 
them as examples of what hard 
work will do for a man or woman. 
On Broadway observing eyes see 
Mrs. Burnett entering the Family 
Welfare Association in silver, high- 
heeled sandals with open - work 
stockings of a very intricate weave. 
The money spent for the footgear 
went to help support thè families 
of the Italian-women who knitted 
them and so lightened famous 
social worker Burnett’s tasks. At 
Gammon’s appears Mr. Lester Mid- 
dlethwaite Beattie attired in pink 
silk polka-dot pajama?, which cro- 
ated quite a furore. Hard-work- 
ing Mr. Beattie knows well how 
to do that—he made a fortune by 
attention to the very small details 
of life, and such advertising means 
millions of dollars to hi? company. 
With him, we are told, was Miss 
-Rebecca Pilgrim in an exciting 
ensemble of red flannel. Miss . Pil­
grim, we are to understand, knows 
her colors.
SOME OF US went to' church 
for the afternoon services. There 
we saw Miss Edith Winchester 
not ashamed to appear in high 
black buckled arctics. She /is a 
woman who knows how to save. 
And Mrs. Edna Granna wearing 
a pomfortable yellow chiffon made 
in the old Greek manner. In strik­
ing contrast was the otfcd-famous 
playboy of the campus, V. G. 
Parisi, looking on with wistful eyes 
from the tonneau of a decrepit 
1910 Overland and wearing striped 
overalls—the kind you can buy for 
half a dollar in the poorer sort of 
emporiums.
NOW CARNEGIE Tech can 
teach other schools a lesson. Wise 
Manager överend has good-look­
ing instructor Carrol appear at the 
Cathedral in football togs. Hun- 
• dreds, out of curiosity, will now 
purchase scats at Tech games and 
pay three dollars apiece for them.

A PILLAR OF SALT
By PAYNE DE GREEF
Cathedral of Learning
Of all the educational monstrosities 
and shams invidious to high 
voltage transmission of culture, the 
building still undergoing construction, 
known as the “Cathedral of Learn­
ing,” in whose shadows we ply our 
own tear-jerking ,and ballyhoo, is 
certainly the most. stupendous and 
colossal.
The magnificoes who planned it 
seem to have staggered blindly about, 
rheumatically at first, but later with 
more accurately directed celerity and 
dispatch, with the shimmering illusion 
that the average college student 
wants to matriculate at a school that 
erects buildings which rate higher 
than their hired and paid agglomera­
tion of muscle-bound mentalities and 
pianb-mover bodies, known as a foot­
ball team.
It is clearly another tentacle of 
the crass capitalistic coercion so 
cleverly closing its claws on con­
temporaneous culture. This octopus, 
kaledescopic in color, sunning, itself 
in the innocent gaze of adolescents, is 
slowljr flim-flamming them into a 
kind of hypnotic mesmerism of being 
deceived by appearances, lulling them 
into a soporific stupor, while it con­
trives to cat the heart of Mr. Plain 
Man.
But what of the awakening? Al­
though their governmental innards arc 
rumbling away like an airplane motor 
with six blown gaskets, soon they 
will be able to produce even greater 
depressions than we. It is all a 
problem in the social sciences.
But we can all recline in- our 
chairs with the most withering and 
caustic expressions on our counten­
ances, knowing that the Cathedral 
with its beautiful spire is just a 
thermometer, and its elevators the 
mercury column showing the progress 
of students, hungry and famished to 
learn, riding helter-skelter up and 
down its vertical veins.

STUDENT COUNCIL RUNS AMUCK
Clap Instructor Into Calaboose For Strangling
—Employment Bureau Files.
MIKE SCHONVIZNER
Michael Alf Schonvizner was in­
carcerated today in his Bayard street 
hideout, following a three hour man­
hunt by the police for the murderer 
of the one and only Mr. Orbin.
Orbin was found strangled with 
the radio chord from three different 
sets in his private office. He was 
wearing his usual cream-colored two- 
pants suit, tin hat, pongee shirt, 
mauve necktie, no ¿arters, and orchid 
shorts (Pgh. Press society editor 
take note). Two bottles ¿of seventeen 
year old whiskey from his stock in 
Room 1, Industries building, were 
opened on the desk.
After an all night grilling the 
suspect revealed the sordid details 
of his crime. He had approached the 
business manager, Mr. Orbin, with 
a requisition for a little A. C. cur­
rent for. his laboratory. Orbin sent 
him to Fairley. Fairley sent him to 
Schneider. His nibs, the janitor, sent 
him back to Orbin. From there Orbin 
decided Mike had better see Tarbcll. 
Tarbell sent him to Mott. Mott re­
ferred him to Ihrig. Ihrig called in 
Work. Work could do nothing with­
out Porter. Porter replied over the 
phone, that he had nothing- to say 
(students take note). Mike was sent 
to his old crony McCully for the 
necessary drawing. McCully was busy 
on his farm and recommended his 
former student assistant Kolb. Kolb 
was • asleep in E. E., and Mike in 
clespair returned to Orbin. The 
strenuous day, and the hangover from 
the night before, had been a terrific 
strain on the brain even for an 
ex-tap dancer. When Orbin listening 
to his radios, pleasantly remarked 
that perhaps a decision could be 
reached after Prexy Baker’s return 
from Monte Carlo in a few months— 
even a man from Case could control 
himself no longer. He decapacitated 
the business manager with a few 
footbajl tactics and holds learned on 
the ore boats, and exacted the su­
preme penalty.
Questioned in his cell later, Mike 
admitted that his plea would be tem­
poral sanity. The cause of his sor­
rowful career he traced back to that 
first dipper of whiskey taken with 
a pork chop on an empty stomach 
way back even before he learned 
his song and dance act.
FJis. classes will meet as usual.
Dean Charges 
Old Book Fraud
George Pillsbury, who keeps old 
books in circulation and your money 
out of same, has been at last put
on the mat b}f the Dean of Men
for practices more often associated 
with high finance than with the
groves of sapience. "He has,” in­
toned the Dean, “rung the wrong 
doorbell. He' should be suspended 
for two years, preferably by the 
ears.- I gave him ten books to sell 
four years ago, and he alleges that, 
as he remembers, he sent me a check.

GILES ARMENTROUT IS 
FOULLY ABDUCTED 
WHILE SLEEPING
Little Giles Murray Armentrout, popular mascot of the . Car­
negie Tech football team, was mysteriously kidnapped from his 
cradle in the practice house"of the Home Economics students early 
this morning. The crime was not discovered until Elsa Steinbart, 
the infant’s nurse, had returned from the kitchen with the child’s 
morning bottle.
George Henry Hildebrand, III, 
Chief of Police, was summoned and 
upon his arrival he immediately 
detected foul play. The only .clue 
which Chief Hildebrand could dis­
cover was the remains of a bottle, 
of gin spattered over the floor. 
The Chief’s aides, Elmer <Kenyon1 
and Sam Ross, has already pursued 
a well-known motor bicycle as far 
as the notorious Skibo Inn, but all 
clues were lost behind the thick 
smoke screen hanging over the 
den. Sheriffs have been stationed 
at all entrances of the campus in 
an effort to question all passers:by.
At - the time of his .disappearance, 
Little. Giles was wearing a white 
flannelette, tcdciy bear suit. The 
darling . of the Household Eco­
nomic Department would easily be 
recognized by his tousled blond 
curls, shiny blue eyes, clear white 
skin, and sunny disposition.
The football team is on' the 
verge of collapse over its loss. In 
fact, Captain Hook Sample was
rushed to the hospital immediately 
to avoid a nervous breakdown. In 
spite of his condition Captain Sam­
ple is asking the kidnappers to

With this issue of the Car­negie Tartan, the campus weekly becomes a thing of the past. The abolition of the publication is the direct result of difficulties with the Executive Board arising from an article recently printed in the socicty columns. Stu­dents will openly show their appreciation to the Executive Committee as a part of the demonstrations of Campus 
Week.

FOLLOWS PUTS SELF 
TO SLEEP IN CLASS
Should a man’s life insurance 
policy be larger because he lec­
tures before college students? Most 
everyone would say the idea is 
foolish. George H. Follows, of the 
Commercial Engineering Depart­
ment declares the idea is not face­
tious, and proudly exhibits a policy 
doubled since he began lecturing 
to the Aeronautical seniors.
He offers his own case as the 
supreme example of how' a man 
who aspires to turn handsprings at 
eighty-five can endanger his life in 
appearing before students. He has 
survived the most terrible trial of 
learning to drive an automobile at 
sixty-five years of age, his sum­
mers in the Canadian backwoods 
have given him a virile constitu­
tion, a high-strung temperament has 
served him in good stead in many 
an industrial dispute; but within 
the sancity • of his own . class­
room has he suffered the. worst 
disaster in his career.
It was an eight-thirty lecture 
and, despite raptuous tales on 
“How I made my first million” 
(Rittman has real competition
here), the number of students asleep 
was both amazing and disturbing 
to King George. Seeing one man 
directly in front . of him sleeping 
serenely, the good Englishman be­
came . restive. Suddenly, shouting 
in a strong voice: “Wake that man 
up!” he was amazed to hear two 
hundred throats chorus sweetly, 
’’Waken him yourself. You put 
him to sleep.”
The even temper of his fore­
fathers was surely put to a severe 
test. But he decided upon an un­
usual cdurse of action. He would 
show them just how disrespectful 
it looked, to sleep in class. So, 
with a mighty leap he attempted to 
jump upon the large lecture table 
in order to lie down and sleep 
himself. Unfortunately, the table 
collapsed, the water pipe within 
broke, the plaster from the ceiling 
crumbled, and a high tension wire 
dropped across his . fallen body. 
Meanwhile, the students, leaving 
the body writhing in a pool of 
blood, filed slowly out the doors 
chanting a sorrowful dirge.
Good night, kiddies. Pleasant 
dreams!
H. K. DAVIS FIGURES 
IN HOT AIR TRAGEDY
Grim tragedy stalked into the Com­
mercial Engineering laboratory yes’- 
terday when a piece of the equip­
ment, a fifty-horsc-power G. How- 
they Pilot Hot Air Machine, ex­
ploded, killed one student, and seri­
ously damaged seven others whose 
future joint salaries arc predicted 
to be $100,000 per annum.
The deceased, H. K. Davis, whose 
finesse in handling the machine’s con­
trols was surpassed only by his 
management of women, was substi­
tuting for i the department’s pet bull, 
which usually furnished the bellows 
for the device. When it became over­
strained, the whole apparatus func­
tioned as a blow-off valve and scat­
tered students, ten full-length mir­
rors, and statistics all over the 
campus. H
Among other, devices demolished 
was an expensive Hand-shaking Ma­
chine whosq sensitive grips,-• when 
subjected to pressure, registered on 
a guagc calibrated from A to F.
. Prof. Follows, when interviewed 
about this little unpleasantness, ad­
mitted that he woulcl miss Mr. Davis's 
invaluable teaching helps, smiled, and 
whistled softlj',’ "God Save the King.”

CARNEGIE’S NEW ACTIVITIES BUILDING
In tfyis magnificent building, Carnegie students will openly enjoy many new and hitherto-untold-of pleasures and experiences.
NO FINAL EXAMS, 
DECREES DR. BAKER
An order issued .by President 
Thomas. S.. Baker states that “all 
instructors are absolutely forbidden 
to administer final examinations for 
the second semcsfer in the college 
year of 1931-32.”
This order, which has met with 
such disapproval on the part of the 
students that Student Council ac­
tion is pending to abate the un­
popular decree, resulted from the 
fact that a paltry list of 170 stu­
dents in Carnegie . were on the 
Honor List for the . first semester. 
The administration believes that 
Carnegie should have a bigger and 
better honor list.
“There will be no final examina­
tions,” declared Dr. Baker, “until
the Honor List reaches a length 
of 72 inches. Short lists cause 
unemployment among printers and 
office girls. I stand for the full 
dinner pail/’v 
It is understood from authorita­
tive sources that the Department 
of Mathematics instigated the ini­
tial steps for the elimination of 
final examinations. It was only 
after much persuasion on the part 
of this department that the Admin­
istration was convinced that bigger 
apd better honor lists would make 
better football teams. Professor 
Geckler declares that the buffalo, 
whose facsimile appears on the 
nickel, has gained 40 pounds since 
its last picture was taken.
ED KELLER MODEST 
DESPITE RAPID RISE
Edward Hines Keller has made 
good!
Back in Zanesville the town pa­
pers carry the picture of their 
youthful financier who controls the 
destinies of the millions at Car­
negie. Apple sellers advertise their 
wares alongside a portrait of their 
hero. Mothers use the name Ed­
ward (or Edwina) exclusively, The 
little bank on the corner has his 
picture pasted over that of Lin­
coln on the ten-dollar bills.
And has this iffcctcd our hero? 
No! He still has a smile for every 
girl. He wears no bigger man’s 
collar. A low rakish hat still dis­
places the inevitable silk topper. 
He will smoke any cigarette offer­
ed him, and on the floor of Stu­
dent Council he has yet to reveal 
the tendencies of a tyrant. Even 
with others wrangling in heated 
discussion, he is complacent and 
self-assured.
The story of this man’s rise to 
fame is a lesson to every student 
who knows that Dragon is some­
thing beside an organization of 
hungry bachelors. Starting at Car­
negie four years ago as a com­
pletely unknown freshman, this man 
can now get a date for any prom 
three hours before the dance.
Entering school with the desire 
to remain under coyer while he 
solaced himself over the loss of 
a daughter, he was but a student 
for nearly two years. The Phi 
Kappa found liim and made him 
show his true worth. No more 
could he traved alone out to Joe’s 
to sit in silent thought. Now he 
has assumed a place as a leader of 
men. Even Joe’s put him on the 
commission basis. Now as a mem­
ber of Phi Kappa (gin drinkers), 
and of Scabbard and Blade (beer 
hounds), and of'Dragons (only the 
best in Martinis), lie has one of 
the best backgrounds any leader of 
men could have.
As connoisseur of all that is 
proper in financial budgets, Keller’s 
policies have kept Student Council 
broke and happy. Three compli­
mentary tickets to your dance and 
you can pay as much as the In- 
terfratcrnity Formal committee for 
your orchestra, and with the same 
success. L

across the doorway. The dedicatory 
address will be delivered by An­

leader, whose subject will be 
“MONEY IS'NT EVERYTHING.” 
Other short speakers» will be A1 
Minctti, who will lead the multi­
tude in a cheer; Dean Tarbell, who 
will let drop a few words of wis­
dom, and last and least, Tommy 
Baker, who will rise on tip-toc to 
great heights of oratory. At the 
conclusion of the program, Dean 
Green will smash a bottle of gin

AGENTS CONFISCATE 
AERONAUT BREWERY
Prohibition agents, tipped off by 
immigration officials, swooped down 
yesterday on the Machinery Hall 
basement and confiscated a 100- 
gallon still which, under other 
names, has been mystifying every­
body who has seen the contrap­
tion for the last six months. Promi­
nent lights in the department arc 
quite put out about it, and arc 
facing arrest by federal agents.
Many of those concerned have 
been questioned, and all give con­
flicting testimony. Ignor Karassik, 
Senior Aero, and master pilot of 
them all, whose hounding by immi­
gration officials led to the discov­
ery, explained in slightly cracked, 
if not broken, English, that the tub 
was an aquarium for the study of 
streamline flow about goldfish.
Miles Kinley, in his best book- 
agent accent, insisted it was a vat 
for the manufacture of apple-saucc 
which he has been distributing over 
the campus in copious helpings. 
Prof. Blaisdell, who is presumably 
a ringleader in the enterprise, was 
even more indefinite than usual 
when consulted on such matters, 
and would only mutter something 
about gasoline testimonials. When 
pressed, lie fled to his files, saying 
“he would go to work” and dig up 
some information about it.
Prof. TrinkS, when asked what 
lie knew of the matter, said he had 
heard of it, but thought it a joke; 
in fact he was going to use it to 
freshen up a repertory of gags 
that has been shaking the founda­
tions of Machinery Hall since the 
last war.

FULLBACK POSITION FULL
In order to meet the demands of 
1lic player>, Bob Waddell has an­
nounced that spring practice will be 
lield April 11-32 inclusive, at either 
the Pitt Stadium or the Forbes 
Hall Arena. A large turnout of 
players is expected, and,,according to 
Bob it may be possible that more 
..peats will have to be erected.
Although co-captains werç elected 
last fall, both Kavcl and Sample 
'•will be disappointed when practice, 
opens and they find a new man
filling both their shoes 1 And boys
, and girls—what-a-niàn ! 1 It will be 
n o n c other than the "Supcr- 
Schnozzle" Jalonack of old, the man 
made tank, the women's champion.
After a year of rest lie will again 
grace the gridiron with his manly 
forni and strike terror into the
hearts of all opposing teams.
There is but little doubt that he 
r. ill fill the vacancy left by Don 
: Fletcher, thus leaving cither “Dutph”
• Croft or "Tiny” Forsmcn warming 
¡¦the bench. It will be rather hard to 
i;sqc these boys outdone, but it just 
brings up the old question again as 
to the relative sizes of the moun­
tain and the molehill. Such popular- 
"_itÿ must be deserved.

"Buddy” Ovcrend, Who watches so 
that all- the game receipts do not 
go into busted banks, the problem has 
’been solved, thanks to Fanny, the 
master mind at the Field House.
,Tlic answer is that "Bertie" Mun- 
hall will register under an assumed 
name and as an advance student, 
thus making him elegible to par­
ticipate in varsity ball next fall. Jt 
seems that Bertie has plenty of 
.'(liases to register under, due to his

Figures Show Athletic Captains
Stand High In Class Room Work
most out of your educa-Dnrn it, I got a "Bl" exclaimed 
Murray Giles Armentrout in dis­
gust, and with this exclamation 
there came to light for the first 
time in history the Instutlon the 
grades of the captains of our varl- 
nut athletic loams. Much mys­
tery , has shrouded the doings of 
our athlctic captains in the class 
roorfis, and it was only after a 
conference with their Sccrecy Com­
mittee chairman, Jimmy Leonard, 
that we finally got to the bottom 
of the whole affair. NoW f<vr the 
first time arc we enlightening the 
public upon this part of a captain’s 
life.
Many years ago when these men 
began to receive the acclaim of 
the public they decided that utmost 
sccrecy should prevail concerning 
their grades. They were Already 
subject to the acclaim of sport's 
followers, hero worshipers, and wist­
ful eyed co-cds. If their • grades 
became Jcnown, would they not be 
still more pursued? If it became 
known that brain and brawn were 
one and the same thing, could they 
call their tiyic their1 own? Think 
of the chance it would give the 
co-eds upon pretense of. tutoring, 
should it evct become known that 
they were excellent students. 
. Rather would they have it thought 
that they were quick of hand and 
feet but slow of mind. But for 
one incident .this secret would have 
remained hidden for years.
Several weeks ago the highly 
¦ egotistical and conceited publica- 
tion editors and activities leaders 
published their grades and let it 
be known that they co.nsidercd 
themselves highly superior to our 
noble athletes. This was the last 
straw. As a method of self-defense 
and of combatting the ever aggres­
sive publications editors the cap­
tains have at last revealed their 
sccrct.
The point-average of ‘ the cap­
tains of the five major teams is 
S.967. Armentrout heads the list 
with an average of 5.989 for his 
four years’ work at Carnegie. Ho 
was all set for a six point when 
he got his “B;" hence his exclama­
tion of disgust. "Arm)"" said . he 
slipped up when lie forgot whether 
his crib was in the sweater cuff of 
his right or left arm and before 
lie could find it lie had to hand 
in his paper. That just goes to 
show you, said the "Big Train,” 
how much memory means in get­
ting 111

next on the list with an aver­
age of 5.965, Both gave the same 
reason for their excellent results. 
They said it was a very big help 
to know the answers to the ques­
tions during the exam. However, 
they refused to explain further.
Bill Edwards and Tom Coulter 
with averages of 5.957 and 5.948 re­
spectively, said that good grades 
were easily procured by .the the 
aid of a magnifying glass and ac­
quiring a scat next to another 
good student.
We heartily congratulate these 
men. upon their success, and sin­
cerely applaud them for their ef­
fort to secure fame for tli’cir Alma 
Mater not only on the Athlctic 
field but in the class room as 
well.
More Facts Worth Knowing
MR.; BUDDY OVEREND has just 
announced that lie will donate his 
personal shaving mug as a trophy 
for Intramural Wrestling. Aside from 
its instinctive beaut)’, this award 
possesses untold usefulness for Buddy 
claims his mug will fit any mug. And 
for the latter reason fraternity 
.houses will strain every wisker to 
gain possession of it.
AND THESE MID-SEMESTER 
EXAMS have certainly taught us
that you can’t burn the cake at both

LAST MINUTE NEWS from the 
Field House says that there will be 
four co-captains for the track team. 
One of them has had expcrieiice, but 
all four arc cxpectcd to comc out 
for the team.
Plans are being made to have at 
least three more captains for next 
year’s basketball.' This will make an 
all-captain team, and the first of its 
kind in collcgiatc sports. Then there’s 
the follow-up proposal that two play­
ers be be-knighted colonels, so we 
can have co-colonels.
We’re expecting two more cap­
tains for football any minute now.

Entirely;:,too much ha? been, said, and not enough 
seen, about these well known positions that must be 
filled before the next Skibo eleven puts in an appear­
ance. The TARTAN takes great pleasure in present­ing this unusual photograph of the actual pants which the first, string men must -work into.
These very pants have sat on the best grid-irons of the country, and have comc face-to-facc with notables
of the pigskin game. The sizes' vary from a square thirty-eight to a neat thirty-two.And now comes the opportunity for football fans, who follow the game in a big way, to earn some money. Become 'pants conscious and sec if you can tell your players by the pants they wear. Mr. Over- end has offered ten dollars to any student who can name the eleven players ¦who fit the pants shown above.
Englebrecht Wins By Bribery
Who said the Greek’s arc un­
conquerable? Who wants the cour­
age of a,Spartan! It is much bet­
ter to know the art of -holding
and tripping, and to have a little 
side money with the referees; at 
least when an intramural Basket­
ball championship is at stake.
It is a well know'll fact that 
Der Maxie H annum broke .out in 
a new suit the very next day (lie 
should have waited a week), and 
that Mr. vMoscs contemplates a
paint job for his car. What's the 
answer? Your suspicions arc as 
good as mine. Just think of the 
business revival that would follow 
in the path of, let us say, one hun­
dred such play-offs.
Any how the famed Greeks
from- Kappa Sigma met defeat at
the hands of the Plcbian Englc- 
breclit Hall boys by the score of 
24 to 12; which represents the dif­
ference .between courage and skill, 
and art and technique with a little 
bribery thrown in for good meas­
ure. *
In the first half because the ref­
erees were in a little quandry as to 
who was who, let the game de­
velop into a free for all from 
which the dorm - boys emerged with 
a 7-6 advantage due to their su­
perior coaching in that phase of 
their game.
In the second half the referees 
became more proficient because 
they knew where their bread and 
butter was coming from, and from, 
then on the issue was never in 
doubt. It was a question of whis-^
tie who wants to whistle with the 
free throws being all at one end. 
Just to help matters along Der 
Maxie would take a pop at the 
basket now and then myself, and 
Der Maxie has a dead eye.
At the end of the game the 
referees calmly announced the score 
was 24-12, amid cheers and cat 
calls the drinking stein was pre­
sented to . Coach Fergus and his 
boys.
President Jalonack announces 
that the play offs with the Pitt 
champions will be held Thursday 
of this week in the Tartan Gym 
with the runners up playing the 
runners up of Pitt. Inci.dcntly the

Mathis Explains
Sport Problems
Editor's Note: This is the first
and last of a scries of interviews 
with V. J. Mathis, noted Sports 
authority and Chicago play boy. It 
was dictated to our super news- 
hound, F. I. Schultz.
"Tech’s football team took five 
oh the lug this season, but they 
were right in there pitching ball

there were two on, two out, and

a lot of them anyhow. In the

dared get hurt, because there 
wasn’t anyone else to put in. Then 
that time in the W-J game when 
Stewart swallowed his chew didn’t

Doctor Marks Entertains 
Dramats In Private Sanctum
At last the truth is out as to just 
why William "All-American” Marks 
did not Join the Pirates in their 
spring training at Paso Roablcs this, 
year. Every spring in the last ten 
years "Doc” lived and suffered in 
that southern clime and still man­
aged to remain a bachclor. However, 
this year he felt his resistance was 
entirely too low to attempt the 
western journey without the as­
sistance of an able chaperon or 
guardian. Conscqucvttly when the 
Pirate train left Pittsburgh early 
last month ‘‘Doc” was playing "cliuch- 
a-luck” with "Royal Flush” Iianjiuni, 
the Carnegie tabloid man, in their 
secret training quarters at "Joe's.”
Since then life has just been a 
bowl of cherries for the doctor. The 
dramats have discarded their round 
table room for sessions in his 
sanctum, and things have even gone 
so far that there has been thoughts 
of moving the round-table itself to 
the inner olTiccs. However, William's 
dramatic personality must rcccivc 
plenty of crcdit.
During mid-years when the Art 
School inhabitants deserted his com­
pany the ,doctor moved his activities 
to the Presbyterian Hospital where 
a lone dramat lay ill. Here he dis­
cussed the relative values of Shake­
speare and Sinclair Lewis between 
administering of pills, and again 
thanked his lucky stars that he was 
not in Paso Roablcs with Lou.
Yes sir, the Doc is again a happy 
man and is now contemplating buy­
ing a new Ford S roadster to give 
his subjects plenty of air. Well, we 
agree with you, Doc, “There’s noth­
ing like fresh air,” especially in 
Schenley Park. ¦
don’t like the apples, throw them 
back in the barrel.”

Mushball Brewing Well
Intcrmural Mushball is scheduled to 
begin in about two weeks, and the 
mushier the better for every one con­
cerned. Welch Hall was the, winner 
last year in this famed sport, and 
sincc they have transferred, to Englc- 
brcch, this year for the purpose of 
fellowship, will be heavy contenders 
for the throne again.
King Fritz announces that the Cut 
will not be open for practice this 
year but that the field by the Wom­
en’s dorm^ will take its place. This 
position should rcccivc the approval 
of every one concerned because of 
the • surrounding sccncry w'hich is 
very interesting—after dark.
Drastic changes arc expected to 
be made in the rules this' year. Long 
flics arc going to be done away with 
because of the disease' and dread 
which accompanies this variety of 
the spccics. Stolen bases is another 
problem. Last year so many were 
stolen that at present there is a 
scarcity of supply and some method 
of legislation will have to be cnactcd 
to do away with this problem.

AND NOW one final item for 
the economists: The most utiusual 
note in the 'trend of modern fash­
ions for spring and summer was 
in the number of white overalls 
which were worn by members of 
the ypunger masculine set. Many 
varieties of the suspender theme 
were also popular.
BULLETIN!
Studying in any “study room” in

Coach Ernie (I’ve-becn-gypped) 
Scsto, pugilistic imprcssario of 
Schenley Park, is today rejoicing 
oyer his team’s capturing the One- 
hundredth Annual Yeastern Boxing 
Brawl. All Carnegie entries won 
hands down, five by knockouts, 
one by the towrcl rout, and one 
by default. Sesto looked bored as 
is his custom.
Tom Waldron, overweight sen­
sation from Boss Hall, annexed 
the evening’s finale with scrcwey 
knockout; under the rules lie was' 
limited1 to the use of one hand, 
one elbow, and two knees, but as 
lie only uses one hand anyhow, 
this was no handicap.
Joe Burp, leadweight .champ from 
the Brooklyn Aggies, took one 
look at Jerry O’Toole and forfeit­
ed the match. “I ' wouldn’t fight
that d-----m Irishman for any
money,” lie later told Tartan re­
porters.
Carr nearly lost his bout when 
lie accidentally swallowed h i s 
mouthpiece, but he recovered in 
time to win handily. His opponent 
sputtered around so much that his 
seconds threw in a towel, at which 
the referee awarded the decision to 
Henry.
Wertz and Herman Zilch, Wel­
lesley ficaweight, put on such a 
bloody battle that eight tux shirts 
were ruined in the first.; two rows 
alone. Wertz telegraphed a right 
to Zilch’s head in the first round, 
but it didn’t reach ‘ its destination 
until the third. .
Ralph Atlas won by the techni­
cal kayo rout when his opponent 
broke both hands on the top of 
his head. Hellegcrs won in the 
third when his opponent refused to
ALUMNI SECRETS
As a result of months of intensive 
investigation by the “secret six” 
(from Carnegie not' Chicago) the 
following hitherto unpublished facts 
about prominent alumni have been 
brought to light:
Dean Green promised Gertie Zenk 
and Henrietta Accipiter places on the 
faculty if they wouldn’t tell that she 
had used her ice cream fork for the 
fish at a Mortar Board Dinner.
Frank Foote has become an as­
sistant to a former prominent sec­retarial student.
Leonard Schnupp’s football playing 
must have been inspired by the girl 
back home. Wc hear he’s getting 
married.
Ruth Buckwalter has a car;—some 
more mis-applicd relief- funds.
Al Menetti voted for prohibition.
Charles Sclsam, traveling secretary 
for T X has more clothes than the 
princc of Wales. A suit from each 
chapter is his motto.
Mayor Kline topk lessons from 
Marvin Fox in politics.
George Necse couldn’t get a job so 
he is spending his time in perfecting 
a hair restorer.
Ida CampbcU will be married in 
June if she doesn’t change her mind.
Paul Brautigau is utilizing his 
musical abilities in The Salvation 
Army.
go on; lie claimed that Hellegers 
had athlete’s foot and he didn’t 
wish to be exposed to the dreadful 
disease.
After the bouts had been com­
pleted, Clarence Ovcrend made the 
popular announcement that the A. 
A. had appropriated sufficient 
money to buy Referee Carlson a 
new wheelchair for next year’s 
tournament. There are many in 
this locality who will welcome this 
improvement.
GETTING THE JOB
Undergraduates arc urged to make 
use of the following suggestions sub­
mitted 'by prominent alumnus if 
they arc desirous of mounting the 
rungs of the ladder to success.
1—Don’t bother to look for a job. 
There are so many positions open 
for promising young college gradu­
ates that you will be sought after immediately.
2—Hoyever, don’t consider any-, 
thing under $5,000 a year.
3—Demand a six hour day and a 
five day week. These are much 
longer hours than you have been use 
to, but to obtain real success, one 
must be willing to sacrifice.
4—Use "Zero” Gccklcr as a refer­
ence. i
5—When applying for a position, 
always be late for your appointment. 
It crcates the impression that you 
are some one NOH .importance.
6—Wear your "campus cords”— 
the dirtier the better. Then they will 
know that you have been to college.
If these suggestions don’t work, 
join the breadline that is being form­
ed by the 1931 graduates.
TRACK MANAGERS can report 
to the -Field House any time, now 
that the hard work has been done. 
Freshmen, seeking this job, should 
report to the same place immediately 
so that reservations can be made for 
them on. the trips. Only Plebes who 
like to travel should go out for 
managers.

(Editors Note): Realizing that

Carnegie’s New Activities Building
On February 32 last, Carnegie Tech threw open the doors of the lat­est addition to the sampus, the Activities Building. It was a gala day for all the groups, past, present and future, night and day. The idea for such a mammoth structure was conceived by both Councils and after strenuous efforts on the part of all groups concerned a campaign., was launched to proceed with the construction of the edifice.The architectural department of' Carnegie Tech held a competition in 1831 and the resulting building was the winning design of the contest. It is of the Corinthian style of architecture, and its strong vertical lines of classical Greek design, topped off by the elaborate cornice brings the ¡structure into'harmony with the other architectural structures on the campus. A huge crystal dome with heavenly bodies mosaiccd upon it features the interior design of a magnificicnt assembly and ballroom. This dome is so arranged that, upon pressing a small electrical switch in the engjne room, it will revolve shedding multitudinous rays of light upon the whole interior. It surpasses in beauty ‘ anything ever before attempted.
Ground was broken three months ago and the first spade-full of "Cut-fill" dirt was taken out’ by Dr. Baker •with a gold filled shovel which is now on display in the Assembly Room. All records for speed of construction have been shattered, even that of the Empire State Building in New York. Mr. Orbin is elated over the monument to student effort which rises at the junction of Forbes street and Morcwood and Woodlawn avenues. No more ideal spot could be chosen for such an enterprise as it furnished abundant parking facilities for the students, including co-eds.
The success of the venture was so tremendous that after the first week the building was thrown open the crowds attending functions soon taxed the capacity of the various rooms to the extent that it was de­cided to erect an addition to take care of overflow and furnish additional rooms for such other activities that go to make up student life. The new quarters which were added arc shown by way of addition on the right of the main ‘ structure. Ample space is now available for club rooms, study rooms, publication rooms, honorary fraternities, etc., and shows wonderful f^csight on the part of the administration in selecting such a building for our use. Space is even provided for the "Hut” and dismantling of this shed will start soon.
Architects throughout the country, acclaim that the beauty of our new' Activities Building in unequalled. on any campus of the country. The design shows wonderful conception of monumental architecture and definitely proves the superiority of our architectural department over other schools and colleges that do not boast of such a department.
One of the greatest conventions 
that citizens of New Castle have 
ever witnessed was held there last 
month by night students represent­
ing, almost every school in the 
country. 1
The local delegation which, was 
headed by Nickhazy and accom­
panied by the famous Kiltie Band 
received a tremendous ovation as 
it arrived by, plane at the New 
Castle Municipal airport.
It was an inspiring sight that 
warmed the heart6 of all former 
Carnegie men as they watchcd the 
wearers of the Plaid march from 
the airport ,bcllowing the "Hoot 
Mon’’ football yell.
This was considered a novel way 
of advertising the fact that they 
came from a scotch institution 
where everyone has for his motto 
Andrew Carnegie’s immortal lines, 
My Heart is iti my work,” but 
my money is in the stock market, 
which means that they cannot con­
tribute toward any moment that 
might be advocated for the relief 
of unemployed night students.

discussed, and among the speakers 
was Prof. KirkPatrick, who told

with this .great Indian leitder.

Rating Declared Be­
low College Standard
Declaring that students in the 
Night College Industries arc bclowr 
college standards, councilmcn from 
the Night College Engineering who 
have . been waging the relentless 
battle to refuse that college recog­
nition, finally won their point at 
the March meeting of the Night 
Student. Council.
As the result, President William 
Hoddcr of Council demanded the 
immediate resignation of John 
Sampson as Secretary of Council 
and divested him and his three ctol- 
lcagues of all councilmanic powers.
Councilman Matt Crawford of 
Engineering College enumerated a 
list of . reasons which he claims 
attested to the incompetence and 
questionable intelligence of Indus­
tries men.
Among others lie declared that 
none of these men had [voted for 
Buck McGovern fbr County Omis- 
sioncr at the recent election! That 
a recent meeting of , council was 
held in the dark because none of 
the industries men knew' enough to 
press the light button. When ask­
ed why engineering councilmcn did 
not press the button, he replied 
that they were so absorbed in 
some sort of indiffcrential calculus 
that, they were not even aware of 
the darkness.
It was indicated that Council’s 
decision will be appealed by In­
dustries Councilmcn to President 
Quaker.

FRITZ’S PARTY
Photograph taken in Fritz's cabin 
aboard S.S. Bremen as it crosscd the 
Atlantic to Europe last summer. Left 
to right—Miss Winchester, Frit?., Miss 
King, and Mr. Orbin.
When Fritz, Carnegie’s horticul­
turist, went to Europe last summer, 
he accidentally met two instructors 
and the Business manager aboard 
the same ship. He did not know that 
a representative of Carnegie Tech’s 
publications was aboard also, con­
sequently conclusive evident, taken at 
great risk of life and limb, was se­
cured of proceedings which went 
on during the voyage. This evidence 
was secured by the agile reported 
when he suspchdcd himself over the 
side of the ship and took a flash­
light photograph throught the port­
hole of Fritz’s cabin.
Other stories were brought back, 
how they met, the happenings be­
hind open doors, etc., etc., but be­
cause of lack of photographic evi­
dence it has been decided to. confine 
out comments upon the pictured evi­
dence.
The administrative board is now 
considering, what action to take in 
this case. We are predicting that 
some changes will be made in the 
teaching faculty and the much neg­
lected lawn will have a new at­
tendant, since Fritz will be deported 
as an undesirable, and as to the fate 
of Mr. Orbin—time alone will tell, 
but wc predict that lie may be in 
the position of a mayor of Pitts­
burgh.

Purple Spats Cause 
Riot In Arts School
A suppressed desire for vengeance 
came to light last Monday evening, 
when several enraged night Arts 
students suddenly pounced upon one 
ofMhcir .own classtnatcs, whom they 
accused of "disgracing the smock” by 
appearing in classcs with purple 
spats.
The eccentric victim, listed in the 
night student directory as Earl Miller, 
was carried in a scmi-concious con­
dition to the office of Dr. Marks. 
Upon rccciving 1 first aid, lie was 
rushed to the sycho-pathctic ward of 
the Magee Hospital for hydrophobia 
treatments.
In the mclcc that ensued,, Prof. 
Warner was struck by a flying easel 
as he sought to defend the un­
fortunate victim from the fury of 
his irate classmates.
From his hospital bed Mr. Warner 
stated that hair in his eyes prevented 
him from seeing the oncoming easel. 
This explanation, however, seemed 
rather strange in view of the fact 
that Mr. Warner is cdmplctcly bald. 
An investigation disclosed the fact 
that it was not his hair, but that 
of one of his fair student’s, named

WHY THIS ISSUE •
Once a year now, for the past three years, the TARTAN 
has prepared a “razz” issue, coining out on the Tuesday near­
est April Fool Day. In this issue the dignity and rights of 
everyone about school, which good taste or necessity protect 
at normal times, are violated with carefree abandon. Ridicule 
is not the purpose in mind. -The stories, ludicrous and far­
fetched as they are, have a certain sarcasm and irony repre­
senting uncensored opinions of at least a few of the student 
body. The stories are fictitious or hypothetical, and are con­
ceived not for personal affront but for the entertainment value 
they might possess.
Letters From Readers
The chief complaint that has been 
registered against this column is that 
the author has spared himself. Mind- 
‘ful of this fact the following letters 
arc published as typical of the mail 
which zvas received during the month.
Dear Mr. Kolb:
’ I hope you will forgive me for 
this little note, for I simply must 
tell you how wonderful you are. I 
have been watching you from a 
distance for the last five years and 
to nie you grow more handsome 
every day. I like the way you hold 
your head, the masterly way you 
handle everything, and the charm 
and freshness of your conversation. 
You are my ideal.
(Signed) Your Pal Mary.
And. here is another:
Kolb—Listen you addle headed oaf. 
We’ve had enough of your flab­
by squemish, diluted, inconsistent, 
scrubby, illiterate and pusillanimous 
statements about us. At first we 
thought it was skulduggery and 
malpractice but knowing you, we 
prefer to regard it as the meaning­
less mouthings of an empty mind. 
You are a misguided and egotis­
tical little whiffett.(Signed) Your Pal Art.
DO OR DIET
Students, a great danger faces 
us. In practically every classroom 
on the campus we arc bombarded 
with preciously amusing; utterly 
delightful and laughter-provoking 
quips and sayings ijjpm the tongues 
of our instructors. With the vigor 
of Dean Tarbell, the humor of 
Bob Waddell, and the subtlety of 
Fritz the gardener, our professors 
bring forth gales of laughter from 
students unmoved by the antjes of 
the Four Marx Brothers or Calvin 
Coolidge.
And what is the result of this 
laughter and merriment? Our girls 
are becoming fat. In spite of diet, 
depression, and prayers^ the flood 
of professorial wit has caused 
Maggie Murphs to look like 
combination of a Turkish Harem 
and the Academy chorus.
The boys of the campus, appalled 
by the . plumpness of the women 
students, are deserting these dam 
sels and instead are lurking in the 
shadows of the Magee Hospital 
and the five-and-ten-cent stores.
Shall wc abandon our brave lads 
to the wiles of the women of 
Krcsge’s? No! Let us amputate 
the professorial funny-bone.
(Signed) Stocky.
FROM THE FENCE
Advice to Lovelorn
Dear Beatrice Bumpy:
For the past year I have been 
in deadly combat with one of my 
fellow senior Commercials for the 
favor of one of the Music Depart­
ment’s fairest. I know that you 
can ludp me in my problem, Bea­
trice. Bumpy, because last year you 
gave, such wonderful advice to my 
adored one when she was dating 
my. hated rival, but now that she 
has promised me her undivided 
love, I am confronted with a seri­
ous problem: How can a young
man pass his college courses and 
still see his beloved every night? 
You sec, she lives out in Dormont 
and the last car leaves at 12:30. 
Somehow or other I usually miss 
the last-car, and that means I have 
to walk home. Gosh, I do like 
her, and "I want to see her every 
night, but I wonder if there isn’t 
some way that I could budget my 
time. 'Please help me, Miss Bumpy.Legs.
Answer:
Take along an efficiency expert 
who can watch your technique for 
several evenings. Perhaps lie can 
see' if and where you lose time. 
He may think 3rou waste your 
whole evening, but that’s none of 
his darn business. If he steals 
your girl, you’ll know he is effi­
cient.
Dear Beatrice Bumpy:
I date.two boys regularly.- One 
is" a Phi Kappa, and the other is 
a Delt. Both of them seem to like 
me. Do you think I am a flirt? 
Answer:
Do I think you’re a flirt? No,
dear, you’re a genius!
Dear Beatrice Bumpy:
I am a basketball player, but I 
don’t seem to register with the 
girls. I am thinking of secretly
dying my hair a more brilliant hue.
What do you think of the idea? 
Answer:
’Twould be suicide. To dye by 
your own hand? Tslc! Tsk!
Dear Beatrice Bumpy:
I’m in love! I’m a sophomore 
engineer, but I can’t study. I’m 
floating in clouds! I can’t come 
down to earth! What shall I do?, 
Answer:
Steady, lad. What if Tech; had 
a pent-house school like Pitt?
Dear Beatrice Bumpy:
My sweetheart is a Maggie 
Murpli secretarial. She can set up 
a good letter, I know, but what 
I’m worried about is whether she 
could set up a good meal if we 
should marry.
Answer:
Well—Peter, isn’t it? I shouldn’t 
worry. The modern girl’s meals 
may be wierd, but they are seldom 
uncanny.
Dear Beatrice Bumpy:
I go with a cute little girl named 
“Dotty.” All my friends tell me 
we make a striking couple. I 
guess I’ll marry her.Answer:
Oh, yeah? Remember, Jiggs 
married a striking woman!
SENIOR BRAWL
(Continued fro,m Page One) 
notorious flatboat sank one hour later 
with Little Nell on board. The 
committee states that it is a most 
imperfect dance orchestra.
The Senior Ball committee thinks 
that the more patrons and patronesses 
attending the better, for less tickets 
will need be sold. It has not been 
deqided yet whether tickets will be 
sold or not, for the committee can’t 
decide what price to charge.
A movement has been started by 
Student Council to recall its recent 
permit allowing the ball to be held 
in Thistle Hall. It is. contended that 
the ball will disgrace the noble por­
tals of ;the. spacious new ball room.
Even the committee nredicts no 
students will attend the brawl, not 
even the innocent freshmen.
DEAN CHARGES
(Continued from Page One)
If ' his check isn’t any better than 
his memory, it will bounce as high 
as a Sigma Nu at George’s.”
Mr. Pillsbury, when told of the 
situation, showed more than his 
usual astonishment. “It is all a 
defamation,” he averred. “My cur­
rent enormous business with the 
sophomores, of this Institute is suf­
ficient vindication from these ridicu­
lous stories.”
THE TARTAN'S REVISED PLATFORM
-No News is good news.
-Elimination of a number of the useless old fogies 
who clutter up an otherwise modern campus.
-Beer on tap at Skibo Inn in place of the present 
spring.
—Build escalators in Machinery Hall with the 
money saved by moving East Liberty speak­
easies into Park Mansions.
-Eurhythmies for engineers.
—More dances like the Junior Prom.
—Less campus nuisances.
—Less work; more sleep.
—An asylum for practicing music students.
—More graft from student activities.

Welch Hall Wins 
Cup For Safety 
Patrol Efficiency
Inspector Hooey of the Oakland 
Police Station' today paid high 
tribute to the dormitory men of 
Carnegie upon presentation of the 
trophy won by Welch Iiall in the 
recent safety contest.
The cup is awarded annually by 
the Pittsburgh Police Department 
to the dormitory boasting the best 
safety patrol. The work of the 
patrol liais chiefly been that of di­
recting students across campus in­
tersections.
Said the Inspector: “It is indeed 
pleasure to present this cup. 
While it goes to a parlicular dormi­
tory, I feel that all of the dormi­
tory students have had some part 
in the winning of this trophy.
I have always had a warm spot 
my heart for these men. A1-, 
^'ays ready for a good time, they 
have, on more than one occasion 
helped to enliven the dreary nights 
for the men from Oakland Police 
Station. I just want to say that 
we appreciate it. True, we have 
had our differences, but it has all 
been good fun. Fun? Say I’ll 
never forget the night before the 
last Carnegie-Pitt game. I nearly 
die laughing when I think about 
it.
“A return visit • can’t come' too 
soon to suit me. And you must 
come down to our place sometime, 
too, fellows. I thank you.”
Tremendous ovation!!!

Chief Hildebrand’s latest move­

James “Slimey” Stahl and Betty 
“Blonde Alibi” Simon. A decree 
has already been issued to the un­

of his organization and has already 
carried out the promise by having 
rookies scout every campushis
den, including the Hut, “Y” Office,

duty by standing guard at the 
practice house. Virginia Artz and 
Mary McKeon are in charge of 
the day and night shifts,, respec­
tively.
Schoen Makes Good
Dr. Schoen, noted head of Carnegie’s Department of Psy­chology, has been hailed by critics all over America as the author of a new novel of stirring human drama—the PASSIONATE WALK-OUT. The book, written in the man­ner of Vina Delmar’s human­
istic tails, is a story of old love. Punk and Punk, pub­lishers, have announced a new de luxe edition to retail at fifteen cents per copy, the binding of which is a special vivid shade ot purple.
At the same time Horne’s and Brentano’s bookstores are completely sold out of Dr. Schoen’s phenomenal LIFE OF THE REVEREND S. PARKS CADMAN. However, a sixteenth edition of the tome will soon be out they say, and those who have been disappointed will then be able to secure their copies.

Dr. Bartow Griffiss, prominent 
head of the Department of Eco­
nomics, has again joined the fash­
ion colony at the exclusive Trav­
ellers’ Inn. Formerly a leader 
among the bachelor, set at Car­
negie, Griffiss deserted the ranks 
not so long ago to marry Sophie 
Tucker. It is rumored that the 
gift the Phi Psi boys gave him 
at a smoker last year first put the 
seeds of discontent with the bache­
lor’s status into his mind. Com-- 
menting on his stay at the Inn, 
the Doctor was heard to declare, 
'It even rivals the place your 
brother ‘Sloppy’ has over in Ha­
vana.”

The course was taught the entire 
senior classes of Engineering and 
Industries. The heads of the course 
were Dr. Rittman (former cham­
pion intercollegiate wrestler), and 
Prof. Follows (he knew Mr. Astor- 
bilt well).

Professor Otto T. Geekeler was 
recently interviewed by several old 
cronies who occupied the same cell 
with him while at Atlanta, Georgia. 
One humorist in the crowd gave 
a description of our head math 
professor to the press at the close 
of the meeting. We borrow it 
gleefully. “Geekeler,” he said, “ap­
peared as a hatched-faced man, 
with a long lean nose,, and eyes 
slanted downward from the smell 
that seemed ever to affront him.”* * * *

big city lights. In a statement to 
their following at Skibo Inn before 
leaving neither of the girls would 
give any reason for their actions. 
The following slogan was pasted 
to their handbags: “A girl’s future 
is -certainly not with her mother.”

The Inquiring Reporter
Interviewing prominent faculty 
members.
Today’s Question: Which of
Shakespeare’s Works most appeals 
to your esthetic sense?
Dr. Baker: Who cares?
Dean Green: Aw, Nerts!
Dean Tarbell:
Rose’s are Red,
Violet’s are gray;
I saw them out 
On the clothes-line today.
Dr. Schoen: If business is half 
as good last year like‘it was next 
year, I hope so.
Doctor Ihrig: Mary had a little 
lamb. Both Mary and her little 
lamb are doing as well as can be 
expected.
Prof. Pfouts:
He bought her the cheapest 
groceries,
And he thought it didn’t matter,
Till she fed him tainted pancakes 
And the effervescent butter 
grew bitter.
Then he beat her, but he bought 
her better butter.
Flatfeet Raid Joe’s Joint;
Break Up Faculty Brawl
Good old Joe—he was O.K. while 
he lasted, but the well-known Pitts­
burgh-Police finally found the right 
alley-^-and Joe’s was raided! The 
Police Department considered this 
an especially worthwhile raid, be­
cause not only did they find Joe, 
but a room full of Carnegie Tech 
people too.. And did the flatfeet 
smirk—
We always knowed you- was no 
good over at that there school,” 
one of the more ferocious shouted, 
“and now we’ll learn ya!" Where­
upon he threw a chair at poor, 
unsuspecting Chester Wallace and 
knocked him out just to prove it.
Embarrassing as it is for us to 
relate, several of our profs were 
found hiding behind the bar. Mr. 
Simpson, that man from Iowa, was 
discovered in a horizontal position 
just inside the door. When the 
police entered, Miss Winchester 
was lazily sprinkling lemonade on 
Simpsy, evidently trying to revive 
him.. Mr. and Mrs. Parisi, that 
ever-loving. couple, were in the 
midst of a French Tango, and as 
one. cop said, “Was it ‘tangy’?" 
Madame Parisi was wearing a 
princess style dress of royal purple 
velvet. The bodice was tight- fit­
ting, as was the waist, the hips, 
and the skirt. Sam, the barman, 
was seen winking very suggestively 
at the Madame as she playfully 
flirted with him over her husband’s 
shoulder.
In another part of the room 
Mary Hauser was found sitting on 
Hal Brennan’s lap, running her fin­
gers through his curly hair.
Ah, Hal,” were her last words 
before they carried her out. Mr. 
Brennan was extremely nervous 
and mussed up as he rose to' give 
his statement to the police.
“I am a staid and upright young 
man, sir,” said he, “and you can’t 
do this to me!” Whereupon a 
swift kick in the pants helped him 
through the door and into the 
wagon.
Mr. Tarbell raised quite a fuss 
when they tried to make fiim get 
out and,get into the Black Maria.
“I wanta stay! I wanta stay! I 
wanta stay!” was his plaintive cry. 
And so he went.
On their ride downtown, how­
ever, our spartan Techites revived 
somewhat and got back some of 
their Carnegie Spirit as the effects 
of Joe’s “spirits” died away. Wav­
ing their handkerchiefs merrily 
above their heads, they sang the 
good old “Alma Mater” until they 
finally fell asleep on each other’s 
shoulders. The ever-thoughtful 
cops quietly put them to bed in 
their cells, and sang a lullaby to 
them for half an hour, just in case 
they might wake up. And so to 
bed.

O NEED to park a “Girls Keep 
Out” at the top of this advertise­
ment. They’ll shy off quick enough when 
they find out what it’s about.
For it’s a strictly masculine privilege 
—solace, satisfaction, retreat, call it 
what you will—the joy of smoking a 
pipe!
It’s the smoke “for men only,” any 
girl will agree—one 
of the few rights the 
women haven’t 
crowded us on. And 
the oiipy smoke 
for men, many a 
thoughtful smoker 
calls it. For the deep 
consolation and 
rare comradeship of 
a mellow, richly 
aged pipe are some­
thing every man 
does well to know.
And you taste the rich satisfaction of 
pipe smoking at its best when you fill 
up your bowl with Edgeworth. There’s a 
tobacco that’s made for a pipe. Cool, 
dry, slow-burning. Blended of fine, 
mellow, full-fla­
vored burleys.
