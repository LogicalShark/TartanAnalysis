Seriously
Speaking
A COLUMN OF CURIOUS COMMENT 
BY NATHAN MILLER
Open Season for Elections
This calendar year will bear wit­
ness to one- of the most exciting 
series of elections which this old 
and much-harassed globe of ours 
' had to undergo in many . a moon. 
Whatever may be said of the 
threat of dictatorships and strong­
man rule holding sway throughout 
many countries, there will be at 
least one more orgy of franchise 
democracy this spring and fall.
In Germany, for example, and 
within ^ very few.weeks, the popu­
lace will turn out en masse armed 
with their ballots (and perhaps in 
-¦some cases with more realistic ex­
pressions of political opinion), and 
express its choice for the president 
of the shaky German republic for 
the next seven years. Old and stal­
wart von Hindenburg is the can­
didate of the defenders of the re­
public, but' the forces of revolution, 
both of the right and the left wing 
have immense potential . strength. 
Should the spellbinder demagogue, 
Hitler of the Nazi forces win, the 
political complexion of Europe will 
break out in another fearful rash; 
should by any chance the Commu­
nist candidate gain greatly in 
strength, the revolutionary map of 
Europe would spread east from 
Russia. The French elections are 
also slated for this spring although 
ho one anticipates perturbations as 
marked as those in Germany. A 
shift to the left is expected, al­
though of not enough intensity to 
modify the strong French policy of 
insisting on the Versailles treaty 
and upholding the status quo by 
force of arms.
" Then later in the fall will come the 
quadrennial fracas and shindig of 
the American elections in which

Sophomore Honoraries to 
Hold Tea Dance Thursday
On Thursday, March. 3, 
from 4 until 61 o’clock, the 
Cwens and the Druids, Soph­
omore honorary societies, will. 
sponsor a tea dance in This­
tle Hall. Will Rychanek and 
his famous erght-piece or­
chestra, a campus group of 
musicians which has been 
popular at previo.us tea dances 
and night school dances, will 
furnish the music. The price 
of admission is 25 cents for 
co-eds and 35 cents for men.
As this is the first time 
this year the Cwens and the 
Druids have combined in giv­
ing a tea dance, it is hoped 
that the students will give 
-their enthusiastic support to 
this affair.
Graduates Will 
Receive Smaller 
Diplomas in June
The forthcoming June graduating 
class will initiate, for the first time 
at Carnegie Tech, the new small 
size, leather encased diploma. This 
new arrangement was presented by 
the executive board, consisting of 
the directors from each college, 
the Dean of Women, Dean of 
Men, and President Baker, for the 
approval of the senior class. The 
decision in its favor was unan­
imous; and henceforth ' all gradu-" 
ates of Carnegie will be presented 
with this handy, convenient di­
ploma.
By being made smaller, this doc­
ument docs not lose any important 
considerations. The cover will be 
of genuine Morocco leather, lined 
with silk. Thc-diploma will be on 
the best of parchment skin, the 
lettering engraved instead of being 
printed as the usual diplomas had 
been made. The leather- covers
will be done in the respective
colors of each college, yellow for 
Margaret Morrison, blue for En­
gineering, red for Fine Arts, green 
for Industries and brown for Car­
negie Library School, all in all 
forming a Scotch plaid combination.
The executive board feels in 
adopting this new plan, that large 
diplomas are not necessary for the 
ordinary Carnegie Tech graduate.
It has been the custpm in past 
years for professional men to. 
frame their diplomas so that they

Architects Will
Exhibit Designs
An exhibition of architectural de-‘ 
signs, the work of students in the 
Department of Architecture at Car­
negie, will be shown in ten high 
schools in Pittsburgh ^d sub­
urbs during the spring.
The exhibition, which, has been 
arranged by. Robert Schmertz, in­
structor in the department, will 
open at Allegheny High School to­
morrow and remain there for two 
weeks. Following this it will be 
shown for a period of -a week at 
Oliver, South Hills* Langley, Car- 
rick, Fifth Avenue, Schenley, Pea­
body, Taylor Allderdice and West- 
ingliouse High schools, respective­
ly.The exhibit will consist of life 
sketches, water colors and architec­
tural designs, many of which have 
received awards from the Beaux 
Arts Institute in New York. Only 
problems of the first, second and 
third years will be shown.
The exhibit has- been planned to 
give the high school student an 
idea of the scope and nature of 
work done by student architects.
Figures Show Publication Heads
Stand High In Class Room Work
Combined Grades of Heads of Tartan, Puppet, Thistle 
and Tri-Publications Give Q. P.
Rating of 4.52
With P.Q.’s a very much minus 
quantity, the heads of campus pub­
lications exhibit a combined aver­
age that is higher than any other 
student group. It was discovered, 
after much slidc-rule manipulation, 
that the grades of the editor, busi­
ness manager, and managing editor 
of the Tartan together averaged 
a figure of 4.87; the salaried Pup­
pet staff an average of 5.23, and 
the combined grades of the^ editor, 
business manager, and advertising 
manager of the Thistle, an aver­
age of 4.25. The' editors of the 
three publications together have 
an average P.Q. rating of 4.44, 
while the rating of the. combined 
staffs is 4.52.
If these figures be compared with 
the scholastic standing of other 
student group's, more significance
can be attached to them. Among 
the men’s fraternities, the highest 
group for the year 1930-31 had a 
rating of 3.SS; among the men's 
dormitories, a 3.90; amojng the 
women’s sororities, a 4.54; and 
among the women’s dormitories^ a 
4.23 rating.
The situation is one that may 
rightly be suspected, for the list 
includes a select group, weeded out 
in three years by a competition in 
which, the persons most capable, 
in intelligence and industry are the 
winners. It is true, on the other 
hand, that the work and respon­
sibility attached to the various posU 
tions make large demands on time 
otherwise available for Study, but 
through this the person gains an’ 
ability to express himself in speech 
and writing that is extremely valuable.
ARTS AND CRAFTS 
EXHIBIT TO OPEN
College of Fine Arts Will 
Sponsor Display Here 
March 2
The community centers of Pitts­
burgh will hold an exhibition of 
tjieir various arts and crafts at 
Carnegie beginning Wednesday,

Arts is sponsoring the display, and 
the works will be exhibited in 
that building.
Four educational centers will 
contribute examples of arts and 
crafts done by.students of all ages 
in the respective classes. Tlie Y. 
W. and Y. M. Ii. A., the Irene 
Ivaufmann Settlement, the Kingsley 
House, and the Manchester Edu­
cational Center will show paintings 
and drawings, sculpture, ceramics, 
and similar work.
The display will be held in the 
exhibition room of the College of 
Fine Arts and will be open daily 
except Sundays to the public.

Discuss Curriculum Changed 
• With Faculty At 
Dinner
Tau Beta Pi, national engineer-j

to representatives- of the faculty ofl 
the Engineering College, the de4 
partment of general studies, and 
the Engineering College adminis-l 
tration at a forum last Thursday' 
evening. The .purpose of the din-| 
ncr meeting, held in the Commons' 
Annex was a discussion of the cngi-i 
nccring curriculum at Carnegie.
The meeting was planned by the 
ways and means committee, the 
chairman of which is Igor’ Karas- 
sik, Aeronautics Department. The 
possibility and value of a more lib­
eral education for engineers form­
ed the principal subject of discus­
sion, which was under the leader­
ship of Harry Kolb, also of the 
Aeronautics Department.
Dr. James, head of the Chemistry 
Department, pointed out that the 
trouble with the present engineer­
ing courses is the impossibility of 
including necessary cultural sub­
jects because of the. lack of time. 
'Discussiorj ensued as to the pos­
sibility of lengthening the engi­
neering courses to five or six years. 
A plan to have summer couises 
in cultural subjects for the Engi­
neering School was submitted by

MRS. ALEXANDER 
DONATES BOOKS
A new collection of books on 
art and European travel was re­
cently donated to. the Hut by Mrs. 
Maitland Alexander, prominent 
Pittsburgh woman. The group, 
which came from the library of 
Mrs. Alexander’s mother is of 
great ‘ historical value.
Beside a collection of photo­
graphs of European travel, the col­
lection includes a ten volume edir 
tion of original Japanese paintings. 
These books are part of a limited 
edition called the Emperor’s Edi­
tion. They are so named because 
the 'ten volumes are bound in the 
ten shades of satin in the Em­
peror’s robe. The volumes con­
tain many original Japanese paint­
ings of flowers and birds.

Registration For 
Second Semester 
Reaches Record
The largest mid-year enrollment 
in the history of Carnegie has been 
recorded this semester according 
to the official registration figures 
issued at the office of the Regis­
trar. The totals, which include 
registration through Wednesday, 
February 24, show's an enrollment 
of 2,326!
This figure may be compared 
with enrollment of 2,249 in Febru­
ary, 1931 and 2,151 in February, 
1930. This semester’s figures arc 
shrill incomplete and it is likely 
that the gain over last year’s total 
will be further increased. The en­
rollment; however, is still slightly 
under that of last fall when the 
registration was the greatest in the 
history of the school.
This semester’s enrollment is di­
vided through the schools as fol­
lows: Engineering, 694; Industries, 
270; Freshman Engineering and In­
dustries, 364; Fine Arts, 561, and 
M. M. C. C. 437.

Annual Tree-Planting Policy 
Being Observed
Under every, kind of weather, 
men arc continuously working on 
campus improvements, and now the 
long-expected walk near the Cut 
leading to the upper entrance of 
the Engineering building is tinder 
construction. The path, which is 
part of the • original road which 
leads down to the Coal Research 
laboratory, has been purposely 
made in the form of a curve in 
order to give it an attractive ap­
pearance. Benches will be placed 
under the willow trees, and shrub­
bery will be planted on the slope 
along the path. The path will be 
properly illuminated so that it may 
be safely used in the evening.
Co-operating with the Bureau of 
Mines, the institute is cleaning the 
ground-behind Machinery Hall and 
Engineering building. All work is 
being done with labor sent by the 
Emergency Agency. The road lead­
ing to Schenley Park, which will 
also be used by the bureau, will 
be covered with block stones.

HIGH ENGINEERS 
TO BE HONORED
Name-Engraved Piacque to 
Hang in Administration 
Building
For the express purpose of honor­
ing the outstanding engineers of 
each year’s graduating class, Thcta 
Tau is planning to sccurc a placque 
which will be hung permanently in 
the Administration Hall. Each year 
the name of the engineer who is 
selected jointly by the faculty and 
students for scholastic achievement 
and engineering promise will be en­
graved on this placque. This project 
has been under consideration by 
Thcta Tau for some time, and it is 
hoped that the placque will be a 
realization before the end of the 
school year.
Thcta Tau is also contemplating 
the introduction of technical and 
engineering motion pictures of educa­
tional value to be presented to . the 
students of the Colleges of Engineer­
ing and Industries at intervals of 
two or three weeks. At the next few 
meetings final action will be taken 
upon this proposal.An important meeting, at which 
there will be a complete installation

Journalistic Sorority Plans 
Inspection Trip
On the afternoon of . March 3 at 4 
p. m., members of the Carnegie chap­
ter of Alpha Chi Alpha, national 
women’s journalistic sorority, as 
well as all women interested in 
the campus publications, will be 
the guests of the Pittsburgh Press 
on an inspection tour of the Pitts­
burgh Press plant. The Pittsburgh 
Press is extending this invitation 
for the first time to Alpha Chi 
Alpha ancl of the women of the 
Carnegie campus.'Since all women working on 
Tartan, Puppet, and Thistle staffs 
will undoubtedly be interested in 
viewing the technicalities of a 
daily publication, the Press has 
cordially included all these women 
in the invitation.The tour of inspection will in­
clude visits to the editorial rooms, 
printing department, and art de­
partment.
Musical Sorority Meets
Saturday, March 5, at 3 o’clock, 
the Alpha Mu chapter of Sigma 
Alpha Iota, national musical, hon- 
ory for women, will hold its formal 
initiation in Thistle Hall. Those 
being initiated arc Miss Antoinette 
Canfield of the Frick Training 
School, Angela Stybe, Mildred 
Cramer, Jeanette Fischel, Marion. 
Swan, and Katherine Kahr.
Following the initiation a ban­
quet will be given at the Univer­
sity Club in honor of the new 
members.
The fraternity has invited as 
guests Dean Green, Mrs. Will Ear- 
hart, and Mrs. Lilliau Renshaw. 
Mrs. Earhart and Mrs. Renshaw 
are patronesses.
INTERFRATERNITY SING CONTEST SPONSORED BY DRAGON SOCIETY
An Interfraternity Sing Contest, 
in which all fraternities on the 
campus will enter, a group of mcm- 
.b.ers to sing their own favorites, 
has been approved by the Inter- 
fraternity Council.
The idea of the contest is new 
to this campus and should its trial 
prove a success, fraternities, will be 
afforded annually one more oppor­
tunity for competition. The plan 
is to have each fraternity enter a 
group of ten or fifteen men to pre­
sent six minutes of singing, includ­
ing the fraternity songs they wish 
to present and perhaps, some of 
our school songs.
Contest Will Be Formal 1 
Each fraternity will present their 
program from the stage of the 
Gymnasium, or whatever site is se­
lected for the contest. Should the 
gym be used, a more suitable plat­
form will be secured, with ferns 
and appropriate decorations added, 
as w'ell as improved seating ar­
rangements. The occasion will be 
formal for the contestants and will 
be started early enough in the 
evening to permit a dance in This­
tle Hall following the sing. Judges 
will be secured from disinterested 
faculty members or outsiders and 
the winning fraternity will be 
awarded a cup.
The sponsors of the contest in 
its initial bow to the campus will 
be Dragons, men’s senior honorary, 
who originated the idea at Car­
negie. The society will present 
the loving-cup award and will 
handle the arrangements for the 
contest.
April 1 is Date Set
Present plans are not completed 
for the details as to entrants and
method of conducting the contest, 
but the date has been set for Fri­
day, April 1, the first week-end 
following t h e Easter vacation. 
Plans call for starting the program 
probably about seven or scven-thir- 
ty, in order to have the contest' 
concluded by nine-thirty or ten 
o’clock.
No Admission Charge 
The men participating in the 
sing will appear in formal attire, 
and no doubt their guests for the 
dance will come dressed the same. 
As far as making the dance strict­
ly formal no decision has been 
reached. There will be > no admis­
sion charge to the place where 
the songs arc being presented, 
fraternities being charged a regis­
tration fee of probably cJne dollar 
to cover the cost of programs and 
decorations. The purchase of the
award will be made by Dragons. 
The winner of the first contest 
will gain permanent possession of 
the trophy.
In setting the date early in the 
spring, the committee hopes to 
avoid interference with the school 
social calendar, and the various 
fraternity formal dances which 
come in April and May. Should 
the fraternities find the competition 
worth while, the school social cal­
endar for next year will include 
this event.Popular in Mid-West
At numerous schools in the Mid­
dle-West the idea of competition 
among fraternities as to their mu­
sic library and rendition of frater­
nity’ songs is quite popular. Simi­
lar contests as proposed for this 
campus are established traditions 
at these colleges.
WILFRED READIO

Tau Sigma Delta
Initiates 3 Men
Tau Sigma Delta, national hon­
orary architectural fraternity, re­
cently initiated three new members, 
Melvin Morris, Edward Schade, and 
Carl Kissling. The initiation was 
performed at a dinner held at the 
Garden Tea Room. Besides the 
initiation cercnjony, a discussion 
was held concerning the modern 
trend in architecture. Special con­
sideration was given to the archi­
tecture of Southern California and 
to the advancing mode in church 
construction.
Tau Sigma Delta is a national 
society in the College of Fine Arts 
which chooses its members from 
architecture and the associate arts 
on the basis of class standing, ac­
tivities, and character. Besides the 
high factor required for admission 
to the society, a certain emphasis 
is placed upon the qualification of 
each initiate to later contribute 
something definite to the field of 
architecture.
M. M. C. C. Concert

Don Bigelow Chosen in 
Place of Fletcher 
Henderson
DANCING FROM 9 TO 2
Fraternities Lay Plans For 
Breakfasts After 
Dance
Because of unusal opportunities 
which presented themselves at the 
last minute, Don Bigelow and his 
ultra-New York orchestra have been 
secured to play at the Interfraternity 
Formal which is to be held in the 
ballroom of the Schenley Hotel on 
March 4 between the hours of 9 and 
2. This arrangement was made pos­
sible by an agreement between 
Flctchcr Henderson, who was to
have played at the .dance as announced 
in last week’s Tartan and the com­
mittee in charge of the dance.
Don Bigelow, who started his mus­
ical career in Pittsburgh by playing 
with the Black Cat orchestra, a 
musical organization which is well
known on the Carnegie campus, has 
tlie distinction of being a whole band 
himself, He is known for his ability 
to play fourteen instruments and ob­
tained finite a reputation through his 
saxaphonc playing while with the 
Black Cat’s in Pittsburgh.
Mr. Bigelow’s orchestra has insti­
tuted a new type of rythm which 
has been labeled truly “New York- 
ish” and uniquely modern. The 
orchestra concentrates on the sweet, 
soft, slow type of music and pays 
special attention to producing queer 
effects in rythm and harmony. Bcrnic 
Cummings, well-known orchestra di­
rector, has -said that the orchestra 
was far ahead of the times in its 
unique arrangements. The orchestra 
docs not cater to novelty num­
bers but endeavors to inject into 
each selection that sophisticated "Bigelow style."
Well known throughout this sec­
tion of the country through its noon- 
hour broadcast over the N.B.C. net­
work from Young’s Chinese and 
American Restaurant in New York, 
where it has had successful engage­
ments for the past three years, the 
orchestra has also attained national 
fame through its many country-wide 
tours. I.t was recently engaged at 
tlie Hotel Biltmorc and the Park 
Central Hotel in New York, and 
will be remembered in Pittsburgh for 
its appcarancc at the Nixon Restau­
rant. Of the many proms for which 
it has played in the past few months, 
tlie Vassar Junior Prom is the latest. 
Mr. Bigelow and his orchestra will

A.S.C.E. TO HEAR 
BOWDEN SPEAK
“Aerial Surveying” is Topic 
of Lecture
Nicholls W. Bowden, senior en­
gineer in the United States En­
gineer’s Office in Pittsburgh, will 
address the Carnegie student chap­
ter of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers at its weekly meet­
ing in Room 60, Engineering Hall, 
at 11:30 tomorrow on the subject 
of “Aerial Surveying.” Mr. Bow­
den is a civilian member of the 
War Department’s Pittsburgh dis­
trict office and is directly under 
the chief engineer, Major Styer, a 
West Point graduate.
Mr. Bowden’s subject, "Aerial 
Surveying”, is one of very recent 
origin, having been developed with 
the aid of aeroplanes within the 
past few years. His connection 
with the War Department’s office, 
which is especially interested in 
this type of surveying to develop 
river and harbor data, will enable 
Mr. Bowden to illustrate his lec­
ture with maps, photographs, and 
other aerial surveying data which 
he has collected during his work.

AND DUKES HEREALUMNI NOTESCarnegie Tcch’s sharpshooting 
rifle team added another bjg vic­
tory to an already successful season 
when they journeyed to State College 
to slioot it out with the Penn State 
team. The final score was 1314 to 
1359 in favor of the Tartans.
The three high scores of the 
meet were turned in by three Car­
negie men. Beckert shot 276, 
Schcrba 274, and Irons 272. Paint­
er with 271 and Holloway with~266 
made up the five man team.
Thursday the Skibo shooters 
leave for Annapolis where they 
will engage ^ the Navy in the 
most important shoulder-to-shoulder 
match or the season. The mid­
shipmen were rated as the -world
champions last year, and have yet 
to meet a defeat this season. Coach 
Sommers feels certain that his 
strong aggregation can shoot an
even match with , the Navy and
hopes to bring home a victory for 
Carnegie. Such a result would 
place the Tartans as otic of the 
outstanding teams in the country.

James P. Fugassi, a graduate in 
the Chemistry department in 1931 
and a graduate student of Physical 
Chemistry last year, is now doing 
graduate work at the University of 
Wisconsin under a Charles A. Cof­
fin Fellowship. He is conducting 
an investigation of the rate of 
mutarotation of d-malic acid and 
the reaction rate of the rearrange­
ment of ethyl isocyanide into ethyl 
cyanide.
The fellowship, which is given 
by the Charles A. Coffin Founda­
tion of the General Electric Com­
pany, is a coveted one among 
young scientists, . for only about 
eight or nine of the awards are 
granted annually in the field of 
electricity, physics, and physical 
chemistry.
The undefeated Carnegie natators 
will close the most successful sea­
son in the history of the Tartan 
swimming sport when the varsity 
facets Franklin-Marshall Collfcgc in 
the finale this Friday at 4:30. F. and 
M. will cotnc here as a member of 
the Easter Intercollegiate League and, 
although little is known of their 
strength, they can be counted upon 
to furnish the stiffest kind of op­
position.
The results of last week end were 
most gratifying to followers of the 
Skibo splashers, as the team was 
victorious in both of their Cleveland 
engagements.
Fridaj', the tankers experienced 
little difficulty in trouncing Case by 
the decisive score of 52 to 23. The 
Plaid team took every individual 
first place except one, in addition 
to winning the 160 yard relay. Pal 
Miller was the high scorer of the 
meet as a result of firsts in the 50 
and 100 yard free style races. As 
usual, Boyer copped the backstroke 
and Dcrcdyne and Edwards handled 
the 220 free style in a capable man­
ner. Thompson placed first in the 
breaststroke but Ted Eastabrooke 
was not so fortunate in the diving 
and was forced to accept defeat for 
the first time this season.
The following evening Carnegie 
met Western Reserve and the out­
come of the meet showed Tech to be 
on the long end of a 44 to 33 score. 
Miller repeated Friday’s dual triumph 
by again placing first in the 50 and 
ICO free styles. Boyer easily won 
the backstroke, being followed by 
teammate Cadmus.
Flushed with victories from their 
recent eastern trip the Plaid door­
men will meet two tough foes this 
week in the form of West Virginia 
and Duquesne.
Handicapped by the illness of Bob 
Smith and Red Fergus the Scotch­
men battled both teams to a dead­
lock in previous contests, but in both 
cases were on the low end of the
score when the final count was taken.
However, this week's games should 
bring results of a different nature 
and floor fans arc looking forward 
with Increasing interest to the out­
come.
The West Virginia lilt will be to­
morrow night at the gym following 
the Plebc-Wcst Virginia Frosh game, 
which will be called at 7:00.
Instead of playing in the Duquesne 
gym as was formerly planned, Fri­
day's contest has been moved to tho 
Carnegie Gym in order to accom­
modate .the capacity crowd that is 
expected. The Freshmen preliminary 
will start at 7:00 with the varsity 
taking the floor an hour later.
Tech students going to the game 
should keep in mind that since this 
is really not a home game the price 
of admission will be 75 cents plus 
a stub from the athletic book. Tickets 
will be exchanged at1 the Athletic 
Office Thursday and Friday. Ab­
solutely no exchange will be Made 
at the gate before the game.
Last week’s results showed a spirit­
ed Plaid team wrecking eastern 
aspirations. At Princeton the Tiger’s 
tail, was twisted to the tunc of 30-15 
as tho Smith-Fcrgus-Jagnow com­
bination proved entirely to much for 
the home team. Carnegie was ahead 
the entire game, and not once did 
the Orange and Black threaten the 
score.
Temple found the Scotch floor- 
men the same persistent team that 
defeated them earlier in the season.
Invention to Be Used in Traf­
fic LightsJOE MICHAELSON
Conrad A. Stone, Physics ’20, 
now chief physicist of the Macbcth- 
Evans Glass Company at Charleroi, 
Pa., is the designer of the new 
traffic lens which is now being 
installed in New York City. His 
type of lens meets all requirements 
and exceeds in practicability all 
previous types. The busiest sec­
tions of New York will have one 
hundred thousand of them.
The new lens was made by 
superposing five hundred small 
lenses, conical on one surface and 
spherical on the other, on the inner 
surface of the glass. Five different 
cones of varying pit^i arc used, so 
that the light from the source is 
distributed to distant points (for 
three blocks in New York), and to 
the crosswalks for pedestrians, after 
the manner desired by the traffic 
department.
Mr. Stone has designed lenses 
for various uses, including railroad 
signals and special lenses for thea­
ter lighting.

If there is any scoring to be done it is not necessary to notify Bob Smith with a telegram, for he is there ready to make the bucket shoot its soon as the ball meets his hands. His undoubted ability to loop them in is borne out by his record of this and last year. Bob finished his first year on the team within one point of high point man. To date lie has lead the city scor­ing race with the exception of a few weeks. Bob has his “off” nights, but when lie’s “on” it is tough for the man who is guarding 
him.With another year to play, Bob Smith will go a long way toward placing Carnegie on the basketball 
map.

Never thought of the Union in 
such a light before. Now that the 
lights are out it does seem sad to 
think that some other hall is 
usurping the place once held by 
the Union. I have often been 
present at an affair given at the 
Union and surely did feel at home, 
The Faculty Club Room was a 
good place to lounge in, too, and 
the combination of the. two made 
an ideal setting for any dance, not 
to mention the other functions 
held there. But that is the way of 
life, new things take the place of 
old.

Washington’s Birthday 
Dance Tremend­
ous Success
All was gaycty and color on .the 
evening of February 22 last at the 
Gymnasium auditorium where myriads 
of balloons and decorative pennants 
formed an appropriate setting for 
the annual Washington’s Birthday 
Dance sponsored by the Night Stu­
dent Council.
Jack Rawlings and his California 
Night Hawks furnished music of the 
calibre that has seldom been heard 
at these dances. Their smooth rythm 
and pleasing style seemed to enhance 
the cheerful, carefree spirit of the 
throngs which showed their unani­
mous approval.
The main attraction of the.decora­
tive scheme was a large revolving 
cone-shaped glis.tcnin£ novelty, sus­
pended high over the center of the 
floor; supplementing this novelty were 
decorative lanterns, some bearing 
silhouettes of colonial figures and 
others in gay colors. These lanterns 
were hung conveniently among the 
maze of the decorations.
Balloons colored in red, white and 
blue, having imprinted upon them a 
picture of George Washington and a 
brief history of his life, served to 
remind the revelers of the man in 
whose memory this dance was being 
held, and whose bicentennial birthday 
was being celebrated throughout the 
country. A portrait of Washington 
together with other scenes centering 
upon his life were reflected upon a 
screen which was suspended over 
the large stage. These scenes and 
pictures were thrown upon the screen 
by means of an electrical projector.
The punch booth was in demand 
all evening where bounteous refresh­
ments which consisted of cherry and 
orangeade in addition to cakcs were 
served to those who desired ¦ them.
The tremendous success of • this 
social function of the Night Student 
Council was made possible only by 
those willing workers who came out 
to transform the huge auditorium of 
the gymnasium into ‘he magnificient 
ballroom with its resplendent decora­
tions.' The wholehearted spirit in 
which these night students entered 
into the task which culminated in 
such a glowing success deserves more 
than a passing mention. They are to 
be commended for their efforts, and 
the n'ight student body is indeed in­
debted to them.

ABOUT THE MOON
Science is certainly a wonderful 
thing. Even an art student is thrilled 
to dabble in its mysteries, and asks 
questions that, may spur further 
scientific research.
Take for example the newest dis­
cover}' of science that the moon is 
not made of ^rccn cheese. How con­
soling it must be to rocket fliers who 
arc planning to shoot to the moon, 
to know that they need no longer 
fear of sinking into the cheese while 
landing, and having to cat their way 
out.
It is also known that Lady Moon 
uses face powder consisting of pumice 
stone and volcanic ash. Assuming 
that some enterprising cosmetician 
will soon adapt Lady Moon's time 
honored formula, think of the work 
it will give to unemployed volcanoes 
to produce -volcanic ash and pumice 
stone. You may even find it neces­
sary to take an extra handkerchief 
along every time you kiss the girl 
friend on the clfbck to wipe away 
the volcanic ash from your lips.
There still remain a few moon 
secrets to be solved however; when 
the Wabash moon is shining, do they 
see the same moonlight on the 
Ganges? Why docs moonlight make 
some people romantically inclined, and 
cause others to walk in their sleep? 
Is moonlight and moonshine the same, 
if so can Prohibition stop moon­
shine? Last but not least who ever 
said that the moon was a lady; 
haven’t we all heard of the man in 
the moon.

The Plaid has always welcomed 
contributions from the night student 
bod;-' and sufficient material has been 
available for each weekly issue. The 
staff, however, is of the opinion that 
more material could be • sent in, and 
is therefore desirous of hearing from 
students who have information on 
current topics that might be of in­
terest to the school at large.
In submitting articles for the Plaid, 
the staff wishes to point out that 
contributors arc requested to restrict 
themselves to news itetnsj and not 
articles which might be treated as 
continued columns or anything poeti­
cal. We dislike to discourage any 
budding poet though, so would sug­
gest if your aspirations be along this 
line that they be submitted to pub­
lishers and publications which deal 
in this phase of literary effort.
The field from which news can be 
drawn is extensive, and the student 
viewpoint on subjects of current 
economical and historical events 
should be of particular interest.
Many night students have, no doubt, 
served on the publication staffs of 
their high school papers and the ex­
perience gained should be of great 
value and assistance in the field of 
collegiate journalism. It is from this 
group that the Plaid is especially 
desirous of receiving material.
However, whether or not you have 
ever written anything before and you 
have an article which you would like 
to submit dealing on any interesting 
subject that might be material for 
publication, just drop your article in 
the Inter-School Mail slot addressed 
to the News Editor of the Plaid. Do 
not forget though to sign your name 
plainly to any article submitted as 
evidence of good faith, for anony­
mous contributions will receive no 
consideration and will be completely 
ignored. Incidentally, any article which 
is acccptcd for publication will earn 
credit towards the Night Student 
Council insignia award.
Engineering Problems
The advent of high speed ma­
chinery, the introduction of new ma­
terials, and the necessity for ob­
taining higher efficiencies from small­
er units have all necessitated a more 
detailed ¿nquiry into possible methods 
of solving engineering problems. De­
signs change so rapidly in order to 
meet competition that it is no longer 
possible lo amass qmpirical data or 
use the wasteful cut-and-try methods 
of the past.
Every engineering student who has 
studied mechanics and strength of 
materials has learned something of the 
theories of elasticity. These theories 
enable one to obtain stresses in vari­
ous members and also in some of the 
more simple instances to find in what 
manner stresses are distributed in a 
machine.. In order to know just how 
large each section should be so as to 
stand various loads the theories of 
elasticity arc applied. This method of 
solution is purely analytical and 
mathematical and has been highly suc­
cessful in aiding engineers and de­
signers to • obtain proper design.
In late years a new method has 
been widely used to study stresses 
and their distribution in cases1 which 
arc too complex to solve analytically. 
The new method is called photo- 
elasticity. It consists of setting up of 
celluloid or bakclite models and pass­
ing polarized light through the model 
in such a • manner that the light 
strikes a white screen. When the 
model in question is stressed in the 
manner desired a pattern of the 
spectrum appears. These different 
colors give an indication as to the 
intensity of stress. The various pat­
terns obtained show how the stresses 
arc distributed in the model. By 
finding where the stresses arc con­
centrated it is then possible to obtain 
a design in which these highly stress­
ed parts arc strengthened. Dr. Frocht, 
here at Carnegie, has done consider­
able work in the field of photo- 
elasticity and many engineering stu­
dents have become extremely inter­
ested in this method of analysis.
The analytical and photo-clastic re­
sults arc always higher than that ob­
tained by actual test. That is, designs 
based on these two mentioned methods 
are always safe. To obtain actual

tained show the resistance to re­
lated stress as in moving parts of 
machinery. In late years machinery 
has been developed in which actual 
models made to scale can be set up 
and stressed in any manner desired. 
Models of shafts, turbo-rotars, bridges 
and even dams have been constructed 
and tested in order to secure in­
formation beforehand so that high 
costs due to tmforsccn mistakes in 
design may be avoided.
All three of these methods of 
analysis require men trained in en­
gineering principles, mathematics and 
physics. It was college men who 
were largely responsible for the de­
velopment of these methods and as 
time goes on it will require collcge 
men to carry on the work. It has be­
come a very promising field for 
young engineers who like work of 
an investigating and research nature.

Think of going 450 miles to at­
tend night classes anywhere. Well, 
We have a night student who does 
it. Sure does require “ambishun” 
or some such “shun” to be able' to 
go the pace.' Five nights a week— 
at 90 miles per moon makes a to­
tal of 450 ^miles. Bet the fellow 
who comes this distance goes the 
same distance back home again. 
In addition to a record for the 
week, wei also have another night 
student who makes a record of 
traveling 110 miles in one night 
in a mad rush to attend dear old 
Tech. Well, all I have to say is 
that I am proud-to ‘be able to 
attend such a school where the 
courses are so interesting that they 
inspire students to come from such 
distant points as Butler, Pa., and 
Mingo Junction, Ohio. Well, done, 
jnarathon travelers.
Even if we weren’t told in the 
Plaid columns that Fritz was back 
on the job, we would know that 
he was here by his trade-marks. 
Notice the dismembered limbs of 
the trees so artistically arranged at 
advantageous points all r'ound the 
campus, well those are the 
peace offerings Fritz is prone to 
make to those students who cut 
corners, etc. They seem to be effec­
tive, but not in the way Fritz in­
tends. Their effectiveness is more 
pronounced in that they make the 
campus look unsightly. One of 
these branches found its way in 
front of the Administration Hall, 
sprawled out as though it was an 
olive branch of victory or some­
thing.
* * * * *
Yes, Engineering Hall is coming 
in for a little more improvement. 
After all the years spent in Walk­
ing down the "quadrangle” we are 
getting a new walk to connect 
with the new set of steps which 
leads to the Coal Lab. Why wasn’t 
this improvement thought of be­
fore. Wonder how much of the 
artistic element will be added to 
the campus by having this walk 
Ir.id. Aside from the beautifying 
clement I thought, the new walk will 
be handy and we are much obliged 
aor the ^addition.
—and that’s what the 
statistician does for industry
Definite knowledge of “where we are” and 
“what lies ahead” is as vital in business as in 
flying. For this expert navigating, the Bell 
System has long relied upon statisticians.
These men study present and prospective 
industrial, economic and social conditions in 
all parts of the country. They gather facts— 
analyze them, correlate them, discover their 
significance to the telephone business, draw 
guidance from them. They study and fore­
cast the changing requirements of the public 
for telephone service. They estimate the 
probable future demand for new services, 
such as radio telephony to foreign lands and 
ships at sea. They keep the executives advised 
as to current progress towards the objectives 
thus carefully determined.
Only by plotting a course scientifically can 
the Bell System continue to develop along 
sound lines.

Choosing the Headlines
After over a month’s exploitation of the public by the 
headline hunters of the city dailies who manipulate the 
news from China one begins to wonder when, if ever, will 
the editorial chiefs refuse to pay homage to circulation 
policies.
The recent war news has proven a heavenly bequest to 
the city editors. They have stimulated a moi-bid interest in 
the public that will permit their several “extras” each day to 
be absorbed, and their circulation heads appeased accord­
ingly. Aside from cheapening the necessary dignity of the 
editorial policy of the paper, the men that decide the man­
ner in which the news is presented to the public should 
realize the serious trust in their hands. .Following every 
war there is a casual revelation of the fact that the press 
inflamed public opinion to its climatic explosion, not be­
cause of a righteous cause, but as a result of a campaign 
directed from the circulation department.
The Iiearst newspaper, chain is the worst offender in the 
handling of the present war news. Few city dailies are 
excepted. It might be noted that neither evening paper 
in this city is on the recommended list for study by jour­
nalists.
The hard-boiled news sense, of the city editors in their 
choice of college , and university news is, if not as impor­
tant, at least as prevalent. The University of Michigan is 
more widely known as the place where Federal agents pad­
locked some fraternity houses, than for the good work it 
docs in academic fields. Columbia is also widely publicized 
as a place where the editdr and football players hotly con­
test professionalism in athletics.
Carnegie, although a victim of occasional “hot news,” 
is on the whole in a more desirable standing than some of 
its contemporaries. Exercising a little good judgment on 
the part of the students and friends of the school will 
minimize the ever present threat of the headline. K.
CALENDAR REFORM
Official delegations from 41 coun­
tries attended the Fourth General 
Conference on Communications and 
Transit, called by. the League of Na­
tions for the study of calendar re­
form and for the revision of the 
present Gregorian calendar. Along 
with the attending’' delegates, who 
were diplomatic officials without 
specialized knowledge of the calendar, 
several of the more important coun­
tries sent experts whose duty it was 
to give advice "on the technical 
phases of the discussion.
Most of the delegates' recognized 
that the calendar has certain dis­
advantages, its principal faults be­
ing: First, the inequality of the
length of months and quarters; and 
second, the failure of the days of 
the week and month to coincide in 
successive years. There also has been 
discussion in regard to the stabiliza­
tion of holidays. The inconvenience 
of the present wandering Easter is 
recognized everywhere, Easter falling 
as early as the fringe of winter in 
one year or as late as the beginning 
of summer in another.
\ As a remedy, two plans for a uni­
versal perpetual calendar have been
submitted, one on the basis of 12 
months and the other on the basis
, of 13. In the former plan, known as 
the World Calendar plan, the twelve 
months arc multiples of halves and 
quarters. The equal quarters consist 
of 3 months; the first month has 31 
days; the remaining two have 30 
days. These quarters also comprise 
13 weeks or 91 days, of which 13
days arc Sundays and 78 arc week­
days. Each month has 26 week-days. 
The odd 365th day of the year,
Year Day, is considered an extra 
Saturday between December 30 and 
January 1 and is tabulated December 
Y. In leap years, Leap-Day is con- 
sidled as another extra Saturday 
between June 30 and July 1 and is 
tabulated June L. In this way the 
31-day months begin the quarters. 
January 1 always falls on Sunday, 
and the working-day begins the fol­
lowing Monday.
In the 13-month calendar, a more 
radical step, the 52 weeks of the 
year are divided into 13 months of 4
weeks each. Each month contains 28 
days and begins on Sunday. There 
is, like the 12-month World Calendar, 
a day between December 2S and Jan­
uary 1, which, it is suggested, should 
be a holiday.
The revised twelve-month year is 
the most adaptable to present condi 
tions, and largely because of this it 
has become the one under serious 
consideration. It conforms to the sea­
sons, recognizing natural law's. Com­
parisons are easily obtained, while 
changes involved require a minimum 
of adjustment. Expenses- are not in­
creased for the business man and the 
consumer, religious and secular holi­
days are stabilized, and the transition 
from the old to the new order is 
made eas}r by the retention of the 
twelve-month year. Thus comparabil­
ity, stability, and regularity are 
secured and all daily, weekly, month­
ly and yearly reckonings are simpli­
fied. ’
Many of the larger nations favor 
a calendar revision, but also recom­
mend a postponement of any change 
until a more favorable time. British 
opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of 
stabilizing the date of Easter, and 
when attention is drawn to the de­
fects of the Gregorgian calendar, Re­
form is regarded as desirable by 
four persons out of five. A 13- 
month year is definitely repugnant 
to British feeling and, unless it were 
shown that such a system would be 
immeasurably superior to any 12- 
month system, it would be impossible 
to pass the legislation necessary to 
bring it into effect. Britain also 
thinks that though under normal con­
ditions it would welcome a reformed 
12-month calendar, it considers the 
present time unfavorable for discus­
sion of reform.
The German delegation takes an 
opposite view : "It is the present 
economic crisis which seems to us 
the most urgent argument for break­
ing away from old institutions creat­
ed for other periods and operating 
to hamper and injure modern eco­
nomic activity. This is the reason 
why the great majority of-organiza­
tions consulted by the German com­
mittee have pronounced themselves in
FROM THE FENCE
Attention!—
’Twas the 22nd of February in ’32. Some of the 
Dorm boys were disporting themselves in the Club 
Room at thrilling games of checkers and bridge. (Note: The- Club Room is now fairly completely furnished and is a splendid institution.) Miss Helm arrived on the scene and think­ing to add a lit­tle patriotic flavor ran off the “Star-Span­gled Banner” on the Baldwin. The boys reluct- Ij' rose but con­tinued with their 
games. Instead of hearing “By the dawn’s' early light” and “The rockets red glare”' there was "Three no-trump!” and “Jump!” and “There’s an­other king for me.” Guess we need another war to instill a little patriotism in us. . . .* * * *
What, No Boxing?—
Too many of the team on probation cancelled the Bucknell bout. That cancelled the formal fraternity dinners That eliminated the formal at­tendance at the dance, so the evening’s entertain­ment declined to a nice informal dance. . . . Hol­loway crashes thru again, and my goodness, Aus­tin! . . . Charlotte Ball, looking not a day over eighteen. . . . Kolb and Corrigan seeing “Is every­body happy?” . . . Of the chaperones, Tommy Griggs, Jimmy Austraw, Cy Henninger, OliverWood and wives tarried for quite a spell in the smoking room after all the other couples had gone upstairs and there was no one left to watch them. ... A few uniformed couples attended the dance formal. . : . Jerry’s orchestra good as usual. . . . 
Scads of P. C. W. g\rls. . . .*. * * *
A Real Assembly—
Those that failed to attend the Assembly last Tuesday really missed something. Assemblies will become popular if the Student Council providesheadliners like Roxy as the attraction. At this school students don’t have enough spare time to trot down to the Music Hall to sing songs and listen to a couple of dry speakers. But they can and will take time to hear speakers as interesting as Roxy. What say that 7you make Assemblies a pleasure by a'continuation of this policy?' . . .* * * *
Girls Gambol
The Laurel Lasses entertained with radio danc­ing and cards Saturday last. Among those present was the Thcta Xi president and the Men’s Dormi­tory Council President. Miss E. Robinson, saw to it that everyone knew everyone. Miss Poister sup­plied fun-at intervals. The early part of the eve­ning was spent by partners attempting to hold one another up on a highly lubricated floor. No casual­
ties were reported.* * * *
False Alarm!—
Last Saturday P. M. two fire trucks answered a false alarm at Linden Hall. Shiix, and we ahvavs wanted to see a girls’ dorm on fire. The laas couldn’t find anything hot in the vicinity, with the exception of a party in a nearby dwelling, so went back to their bridge game at the station house. . . .
The Intersorority, Some Fun!—
Came the Intcrsorority, best of them all, better than last year’s, with quite the very best orchestra they’ve had since back in ’08. All the sisters and lowly pledges glided into the Pittsburgh Country Club, went wild over the orchestra, and nearly fell t over each other to attend the studio party in Oak­land afterward. That party was a grand ending to a grand evening—given by the p and d’s with -the best of intentions with crooning in the kitchen as an added attraction. ... At the dance “All of Me” Was only played three times. It seems that many gentlemen present stood at attention while the band shouted the battle-cry of freedom “We Want Our Beer.” . . . Jim Kelly missed most of the steps in a dignified entrance that landed him nearly hors de combat at the bottom on the bottom. ... It seems that most of the little girls went Sigma Nu or Beta for the evening at least. Beta Pis where were your Kappa Sigs? . . . Three p and d’s in three cream laces, Mary Hamilton and. Buck, Becky Williams and her Phi Gam, Max inde'ed and Jay Lentz in tails, Helen Fleming escorted by our Freddie Hoyt, Charlotte Rothrock and Junior look­ing for a fender unbender, Burry and Binder, Dot- tie Auten wrapped in fur, Saxton-Jenkins, couples hunting for some dog of doubtful pedigree, Betty Farrell catching something assisted by Jack, Dottie George and the Buzz Robison, Peg Morin, Hooks Sample, Alice Lobaugh, Charlie Schatvet and sand­wiches, and Betty Neely with Tom. . . . Incidently a truckload of corsages. . . . People going out to look for a minus moon... And, oh that orchestra!...* * * *
Champion Commuter—
Now that the. Carnegie Plaid lias awarded the Student Marathon we wish to mention a day school lad who covers' a bit of ground himself in the course of obtaining his Tech education. Mickey McGuire, Phi Kap and gentleman and a scholar, rises at 5:00 o'clock five days a week to travel from Youngstown to make his five 8:30s. Histraveling amounts to about 700 miles a week. Whata man! More power to him! . . .*' * *
Meat Soup for Dinner!—
It seems that Prof. Schonvizner was elaborating on one of the primitive means of communication,African tom- __
toms. As an ex­ample he sug­gested that one African village might signal to the next village bv a series of J beats meaning “Sid Krasik is Icoming to jtown.” Then a wag pipes up And get the pot boiling.” Wouldn’t Sid make an appetizing cani- 
bal stew? . . .* * * *
And Now the Interfraternity—
In keeping with the fast changing times the committee changed over to Don Bigelow, of Young’s Chinese-American Restaurant radio fame, 
for the Ball music. The idea was that Henderson might be too hot and fast for the majority of the dancers who prefer slow dreamy fox trots. Don will furnish such. If the Interfraternity approaches the success of the Intersorority it will be a wow!
CLUB NOTES
Pi Delta Epsilon 
Miles A. Kinley, senior in Me­
chanical Engineering was elected
president of Pi Delta Epsilon, 
journalistic honorary, at a recent
meeting. The vacancy occurred when 
Jack Boyle, president of the organ­
ization failed to return to school 
this year. Kinley is the business
manager of the Puppet and active in 
a number of other honorarics other 
than Pi Delta Epsilon.
The next meeting of the organiza­
tion will be a joint meeting with
Alpha Chi Alpha on Wednesday 
March 9. The joint meeting will be 
held at Thcta Xi fraternity house on, 
Forbes Street and will include busi­
ness meetings and entertainment.
At present a committee including 
Harry Kolb and Miles Kinley are 
investigating the possibilit}' of «con­
ducting a contest among the dis­
trict high schools, in the. nature of 
newspaper judgment and prize 
award.
Newman Club Constitution 
The committee appointed by the 
president of the Newman Club to 
revise the club’s present constitution, 
has announced that it .has made some 
major changes in planning the new 
’constitution. The most important one 
is the provision for a board of di­
rectors to govern’ the club, instead 
of the present executive board. This 
board of directors will consist of 25 
members, representing each of the' 
schools whose students belong to the 
club. * The present executive board 
consists of 15 members appointed 
from the club without regard to 
schools. This boa/d has governed the 
club since its organization.
CÀRNEGIE’S ACTIVITIES BUILDING
A Contrib .
Every one of us would like to 
sec a student activities building on 
the Carnegie campus. From time 
to time we have heard faint rumors 
concerning plans for one, but the 
rumors have not been backed up 
by any serious action, and the idea 
of an activities building has re­
mained comparatively quiet. Per­
haps if we realized all that such 
a building could mean in the extra­
curricular life of the student, we 
should be more inclined to specu­
late about and inqtlire into the 
matted At the present time we 
feel vaguely the advantage of. cen­
tralization of student activities. As 
the school grows larger and more 
highly organized, we shall be al­
most sure to realise the necessity 
for facilities which will provide 
this centralization. Evidently, the 
plan is practical, for other colleges 
have worked but similar projects 
with much success.
The activities building at Michi­
gan State, although designed for 
the use of the women only, af­
fords an excellent example of a 
well-ordered and almost ideal estab­
lishment. Built from funds col­
lected by means of a compulsory 
$10 subscription, the - Michigan 
Women’s League Building has pro-
vidcd no very serious financial 
problem. It is an attractive grey 
stone, ivy-covered structure which 
stands four stories high and covers 
an area of about a block. A 
walled garden, overlooked by a 
sunporch lies at the back of the 
building. On the first floor there 
is a chapel, a suite of offices for 
the student government organiza­
tions, a Pan-Hellenic room, tea­
room, cafeteria, and beauty parlor. 
A theater, which occupies a part 
of two floors, serves as a place to 
stage the annual musical comedy 
which the junior girls write and 
produce. A ballroom, a mujjic 
room, a dining room, a concourse, 
and two large lounges occupy the 
second floor. The ballroom, which 
may easily be converted into an 
auditorium, is the scene of Friday 
and Saturday night dances.
The principal attraction of the 
third floor is the informal an in­
teresting library. The shelves and 
reading nooks contain rare edi­
tions, smart magazines, and collec­
tions of unusual books. Aside from 
thfc library there are also com­
fortable rest rooms, private dining 
rooms, and rooms for parties.
The main party room, however, 
is on the fourth floor. It is called 
“The Cave”. Furnished amply 
with pianos, radios, lounges, lamps, 
and open fireplaces, and decorated
with a vaulted ceiling, panelled 
walls, rich draperies, and thick- 
piled rugs, it is a room entirely 
tasteful and beautifully complete. 
A kitchenette where refreshments 
may be prepared, adjoins it. For 
the convenience of both the host­
esses and the guests, this floor also 
houses private rooms with bath 
which visitors' may rent during 
their stay at the college. The base­
ment, containing practical facilities 
for laundering, supplements» the 
beauty parlor by providing soft 
water and an . electric dryer for 
shampooing hair.
Elaborate and amazingly com­
plete, such a building may be had, 
of course, only where the enroll­
ment is large enough to make pos­
sible its maintainance. The per­
fection and detail may be copied 
only where conditions are similar 
to thpse at Michigan State. Mini­
mizing the scale, however; and 
eliminating the luxuries, Carnegie 
could do no better than tentatively 
to regard Michigan as a pattern. 
If we observe the best features and 
arrangements of activities buildings 
already in use, profit by the in­
direct suggestions which they offer, 
we may be better able to plan and 
hasten the construction of our own 
activities building, an activities 
building which will be suitable to 
Carnegie’s needs. D. A.
Oxford Club Has Speaker 
Louis Joffe, a noted world traveler 
and student of social and political 
problems, will address the Oxford 
Club at the Oakland Methodist Epis­
copal Church on Sunday night, March 
6, at 7:00. The subject of his -ad­
dress will be “Gandhi and India.” 
Mr. Joffe is well-qualified to speak 
on this subject. As a young man in 
Oxford, <* England, he knew Gandhi, 
who was then a well-dressed student 
in the University. Mr. Joffe has ap­
peared before numerous organization 
in Pittsburgh, and has always brought 
a message which has been most 
stimulating and" instructive. His per­
sonal contacts with Gandhi as a 
young man enable him to speak with 
unusual understanding concerning this 
character of international reputation.
All members of the Oxford Club 
are urged to be at Wesley Founda­
tion in Oakland this Friday at 8 p. 
m. for a bowling party which will be 
followed by the usual social hour 
and refreshments. For further in­
formation about the club and its 
activities call Clarence Wright or 
Ralph Ercisson at Mayflower 1481.

new idea.
favor of calendar reform. It is a rea­
son w'hich the German Government 
has made its own and supports 
emphatically . . . We find that the 
inconveniences of the present calendar 
are generallj' recognized—the inequal­
ity of the different * parts of the 
3'ear, the instability of the calendar 
and of the date of Easter.”
Mahatma Gandhi was in London 
during the time of the League of 
Nation’s session on calendar reform, 
and When questioned by the congress, 
gave the following statement in be­
half of India: “It would be a splen­
did thing if India’s 350,000,000 peo­
ple could have a single national uni­
fied calendar and as most of the 
Indian calendars arc arranged on a 
12-month basis, it would obviously 
be easier to meet on this common 
ground. I am in favor of such a 
standardized calendar for the whole 
world.”
As an expression of American press 
opinion, the following quotation from 
the Akron Times-Press is typical: 
“The calendar we use today is little 
more than an inherited hodge-podge 
of compromises, without any sense 
from a* mathematical or astronomical 
standpoint.”

HIGH ENGINEERS

of new officers, will be held next 
Thursday evening, March 3, at 7:30 
o’clock in Professor Daniels’ office. 
The present officers of Theta Tau 
are : William Hagenlochcr, regent ; 
Henry Evans, vice regent; Elmer 
Jarrett, scribe, and ^Stuart Myers, 
treasurer. Professor Daniels and Dr. 
Fettke are faculty advisors.
Theta Tau is a national engineer­
ing fraternity.
SERIOUSLY SPEAKING
(Continued from Page One) 
the “popular will” of the people 
is to be put on the record. Politi 
cal aspirants especially of the old 
(and rather frayed) Republican and 
Democratic parties will hew to the 
line, fuming and making a great 
to-do on the bare edges of all the 
great and significant political is 
sues. Prejudices, half-baked no­
tions, resentment, both sectional 
and class, will stew in the political 
pot with the net result that popu­
lation of Washington will shift
somewhat and the “peepul” may
turn over again in its sleep. As 
long as we have geographical rep­
resentation in Congress we may
expect, that on the large, our rep­
resentative there will be one of the 
same meanness of stature and limi­
tation of viewpoint or the ward 
heeler or the hand-picked emissary 
of the machine boss.
The spectacle of all this running 
to the polls will present an im­
mense and diverting spectacle. But 
whether it will give balm and sur­
cease for the world's terrible aches 
is another matter, indeed.
TAU BETA PI MEN
(Continued from Page One) 
Professor Trinks, head of the me­
chanical engineering department, 
but this was, deemed impractical 
because of the financial limitation 
of the summer administration 
which made it impossible for the 
summer school to conduct such an 
experiment. Post-graduate work in 
cultural subjects are suggested by 
Director Mott, but this is also 
rendered impossible by the lack of 
sufficient endowment for such 
work.
In addition to nineteen Tau Beta 
Pi members, the mathematics, 
physics, mechanics and electrical 
departments were represented. •
INTERCOLLEGIATE CLIPS
Two students at KENT STATE 
COLLEGE were forced to leave 
their room because they could not 
pay the rent. Undaunted, they 
dragged logs from a neighboring 
wood lot and built a log cabin. 
Where there’s a will there’s a 
way.
We have heard of very snooty 
dances, but we have never heard 
of a dance where the’ patrons were 
refused admittance because they 
were dressed too well for the oc­
casion. However, that happened at 
an affair at WASHINGTON AND 
LEE UNIVERSITY. Following 
the invitation banquet at the Beta 
house, a group of the brothers ap­
peared at a dance in tuxs and to 
their amazement were refused ad­
mittance. After a general mixing 
of coats and ties with "some stu­
dents already at the dance, they, 
were allowed to enter.
Among the celebrities who at­
tended the annual Charity Carnival 
at NORTHWESTERN UNIVER­
SITY were the three gossips, Clara, 
Lu, ’n Em of radio fame. Fred 
Stone and his daughter, Paul Stone,: 
entertained at- the Charity Ball of 
the UNIVERSITY OF CINCIN-1 
NATI.
Boys will be boys, but they nev­
er grow up at the UNIVERSITY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA. Men 
students at this university are 
planning a national campus tourna-' 
ment of marble shooters ’ for the' 
near future. . A limited number of
the faculty have been invited to 
enter into the competition.
For the first time in the history 
of WELLESLEY dramatic produc­
tion male parts will be taken by 
men. Three stulcnts from the 
HARVARD Dramatic Club have 
been selected to play the male 
roles in "The Man of Destiny.”
Necessity is the mother of in­
vention so fraternity bovs at 
WASHINGTON UNIVE R S I T Y 
have formed an organization 
known as the “Society of Female 
Aid.” Of course, you might think 
this is sacrilegious, but the boys 
in St. Louis arc commercializing 
their fraternity pins by renting 
them to unadorned and unsought 
co-eds.
At MICHIGAN STATE UNI­
VERSITY a new’ system of "cuts” 
has been inaugurated. If you are 
a senior, in the last term before 
you graduate, you may have un­
limited “cuts” up to 25 per cent of 
your total class hours. Students 
who are not on the honor roll may 
“put” cach class one time less 
than twice the number of crcdits 
that class carries. Students on pro­
bation are not permitted to “cut” 
classes.
The playing of .“Minnie the 
Moocher” was the last straw that 
caused chaperones at BARNARD 
COLLEGE to abolish jazz bands 
from, future dances at Barnard.
Pitt Weekly Staff Is
Host to Tartan Editors
Tomorrow, night the editors and’ 
business'managers' of . the TAR-< 
TAN and the DUQUESNE ’ DUKE j 
will be the guests of the editor and 
business manager of the' PITT 
WEEKLY at a dinner in the Rus- 
kin Apartments. The plan for this 
meeting, the first of its kind at­
tempted by the local college - news­
papers, is to have an informal dis­
cussion of the workings of the 
campus publications.
-WILFRED READIO
(Continued from Page One) 
left his position as qrganist at Car­
negie Institute. Miss Topp, who has 
just returned from study in Paris, 
has taken a prominent part in the 
Associated Artists’ Exhibits during 
the last few yca^s, winning several 
first mentions and prizes for design, 
and for portrait painting. One of Mr. 
Warner’s paintings was exhibited in 
the last International Art Exhibit 
held at the Institute. Anyone who 
has noticed the group of buildings 
on the hillside opposite Machinery 
Hall will recognize them in one of 
Mr. Warner’s paintings now on ex­
hibit. Many of the alumni of Fine 
Arts have pictures at the exhibit, and 
Orval Kipp, now a senior in the 
Painting and Decoration Department 
has three paintings there. It is in­
teresting to note, in the exhibit, just 
what type of work those who studied 
at Carnegie arc doing.

A pipe is not for girls
We know why 
men smoke 
PIPES
W
OMEN don’t smoke pipes.
They’re not the style for wom­
en. But pipes arc the style for men, 
and more than 
that, a pipe and 
good tobacco gives 
a man greater 
smoking pleasure 
than tobacco in 
any other form.
In 42 out of 54 
American colleges 
and universities 
Edgeworth is the favorite pipe to­
bacco. Cool slow-burning burleys give 
this fine tobacco exactly the character 
that college men
like best of all./
Try a tin ol 
Edgeworth your­
self! You can buy 
Edgeworth wher­
ever good tobacco 
is sold. Or if you 
prefer, you can get 
a special sample 
packet free: write 
to Larus & Bro. Co., 105 S. 22d St., 
Richmond, Va., and ask for it.
