NEW BOARD OF CONTROL AS­
SUMES DUTIES.
At the regular December meeting 
of the Board of Control of the Ath­
letic Association, the old members re­
signed their duties into the hands of 
the men elected by the various classes 
for the new term. The following of­
ficers were then elected: Prsident,
D. M. Scott, Science, ’12; Vice-Presi­
dent, L. C. Dillenback, Design, ’13; 
Secretary, W. H. Crosby, Design, ’12. 
Albert E. Wood, Jr., Science, ’14, had 
been elected Treasurer of the Asso­
ciation by the old Executive Board 
to fill the vacancy left by the resig­
nation of W. R. Cogswell.
The regular order of business was 
waived and the board acted upon the 
recommendation of Manager Lamoree 
of men eligible for the Varsity “C” 
for the football season just closed. 
Letters were granted to S. J. Taylor, 
Capt., F. S. Crawford, E. L. Clair, P. 
J. DeMuth, W. C. Acheson, H. M. 
McCully, H. D. Balsinger, L. M. Pat­
terson, W. G. Schmucker, F. V. Kes- 
selman, Lucas, Ayres, Buck, and J. K. 
Lamoree, Manager.
When the business of electing a 
manager of the football team for the 
1912 season was reached, the board 
voted unanimously for W. F. Finkel, 
the first assistant manager, during the 
past season, F. H. Haaren was elected 
first assistant manager for the new 
season. Both of these men, together 
with A. H. McGill, the other assist­
ant manager, were complimented on 
their willingness and ability by Man­
ager Lamoree.
The new Board of Control appears 
to be made up of men who will act 
for the best interests of the schools. 
While a few of the classes have failed 
to elect their representatives, the at­
tendance at the first meeting was 
large, and the interest keen. It is 
hoped that none of the men will lose 
this initial interest, as so often has 
been the case, but will continue to 
take part in all the matters brought 
before the body, and give their best 
efforts toward the advancement of 
the Association.
FOOTBALL BANQUET.
Annual Affair At Sigma Tau House.
The football team were the guests 
of Sigma Tau last Saturday evening 
at the their fourth annual banquet 
to “C” men.
. After dinner and with the cigars and 
coffee, Mr. McCulloch summarized the 
season with some interesting remarks. 
Captain Taylor and Manager Lamoree 
followed with short speeches. Then 
everyone adjourned to the parlor, 
where amid singing and laughter 
many of the funny happenings of the 
season were reviewed.
SENIOR DINNER.
The heads of departments were 
guests of the Senior Class at dinner 
last Friday evening at the Hotel 
Henry.
After dinner with Jimmy Knapp as 
toastmaster, many excellent toasts 
were given. Dean Leete, Dr. James 
and Professors Willett and Follows 
toasted the Seniors, while Messrs. 
Cogswell, Boots, Patterson and Hen­
derson toasted the faculty.
Dean Leete, during the course of 
his talk, expressed a hope that the 
Senior Class would form a fund for 
the aid of a worthy student during 
his course in Carnegie. Dr. James 
read his diary for a single week in 
the schools. Judging from hi's notes, 
the Seniors were all satisfied to be 
students and not heads of depart­
ments.
Prof. Willet spoke upon suburban 
life as the hope of the nation. Prof. 
Follows upon the delights of the 
Canadian lakes. Cogswell gave a re­
view of the history of the Athletic 
Association. Boots contrasted the 
effect of a letter from the dean upon 
different men; upon the man who is 
almost moved to tears to, well to the 
effect upon Jack Allen.
Patte reviewed the Mechanical 
Football Season. Henderson gave a 
display of truly Scottish wit.
Late in the evening, Prof. Willet 
played some of the folk and college 
songs of many years ago, while the 
students and faculty joined in sing­
ing.
The evening was a truly profitable 
onet The faculty and Seniors learned 
to know each other as never before.
BASKET BALL.
The basket ball team will open its 
season at Wilkinsburg on Saturday 
night, December 16th, with the West- 
inghouse Club. Last year Westing- 
house defeated Tech in the first game 
of the season by a low score. This 
year we expect to have a stronger 
team, which, under the coaching of 
Dr. Marks and Mr. Ramsdell, should 
prove a winner.
Each of our schools is well repre­
sented on the team and several men 
are from the night school.
Among those who ?ire prominent in 
the floor game are Capt. Ray Wil­
liams, Hall, Douthett, Williams, Kes- 
selman, Savage, Simpon, Heishell, 
Tumpaign, Colvin, Brand, Acheson 
and many others.
Several stars among the Design stu­
dents are expected to come out this 
week after charette.
Assistant Manager Corbitt is pre­
paring a schedule for the second five, 
which will include a number of nor­
mal and high schools of this section 
of the state.
THISTLE BOARD ORGANIZED.
Staff Elected and Other Matters of 
Interest Are Discussed.
On Wednesday, December 6, the 
work on the 1912 Thistle was started 
with a rush. Practically all the class 
representatives were present and took 
an active part in the meeting. The 
policy of the Board was definitely 
outlined to make the Thistle thorough­
ly representative of the four schools, 
both day and night classes, and to 
add certain innovations to the issues 
of previous years.
The 1912 Thistle will contain ap­
proximately 300 pages of written ma­
terial, cuts, pictures, etc., the actual 
amount to be determined by just how 
much materials turned in by the stu­
dents of the four schools. Everybody 
is urged to do something, no matter 
how little—hand in a funny sketch, a 
photograph, a good grind—so that 
each student may feel that he has had 
some part in the making of the book.
Meeting of the Thistle Board will 
be held every other week, and meet­
ings of the staff will be held each 
week, in order that the work maj 
be accomplished without the custom­
ary eleventh hour rush.
Any member of the Thistle Board 
will be glad to receive any sugges­
tions from any one at any time.
The staff elected consists of: Ed­
ward E. Duff, Jr. (Day Science), Edi- 
tor-in-Chief; Miss Margaret H. Webb 
(Day M. M. C. S.), Assistant Editor- 
in-Chief, Miss Anna M. Lindsey 
(Night M. M. C. S.), Secretary; C. B. 
Kline (Day Science), Athletic Editor;
D. T. Evans (Day Design), Art Edi­
tor; J. C. Siegle (Day Science), Busi­
ness Manager; J. C. Erwin (Day In­
dustry), Asst. Business Manager; B. 
J. Patterson (Night Industry), Asst. 
Business Manager.
HONOR SYSTEM ADOPTED.
The Senior Class, after discussing 
the honor system for several months 
have finally adopted it, and are at 
the present time working under the 
system. It is a great step toward 
fairness and honesty in academic 
work; a step which such institutions 
as Virginia, Michigan, Princeton, An­
napolis, West Point, and many others 
have already taken.
It is hoped that in the years to 
come this system may be extended 
first to the Junior class, then to the 
Sophomore class and finally to the 
Plebes.
The system is substantially an 
added course in the training of the 
engineer, for what is more needed 
in the field of engineering than the 
thoroughly honest man. And when 
the day comes, of which this is a 
harbinger, in which Carnegie can of­
fer a three or four years’ training 
under the honor system; then Car­
negie will have added to herself an 
asset which few things can exceed. 
May the results of this entering 
wedge prove highly successful.
----------------o----------------
NO CUTS.
Closely following the adoption of 
the honor system the Faculty ruled 
that there should be no roll taken in 
the Senior classes during the remain­
der of the year.
A great responsibility is hereby 
placed upon the Senior class. But 
it is assumed that by the time the 
Senior year is reached that only those 
men thoroughly interested in their 
work remain upon the roll and that 
these men will never be absent un­
less absence is unavoidable. Going 
upon this assumption there is noth- 
j ing but success expected in the work­
ing out of the new order of events.
PROMINENT FIGURE 
AWAY.
PASSES
JUNIOR PROM. COMMITTEE. 
APPOINTED.
To Start Working At Once.
One of the best known land-marks 
in Schenley Park disappeared on Sun­
day afternoon when our old friend, 
“Fatty the Cop” went from our midst 
to the Great Beyond. Henry Franz, 
as he was known to his intimates, was 
the guardian of the peace and wel­
fare of the public at the library en­
trance to the park. He was known 
to every student and the friendly war 
waged upon him was the frequent 
source of amusement to all connected 
with the schools. The sympathies 
of the students are extended to his 
familv.
President Richter, of the Junior 
class, has appointed the following men 
to act on the Junior Prom. Committee, 
W. W. Powell, N. G. Parry, and E. 
W. Gardner. Arrangements for the 
Prom, are being started early this 
year and all indications point to one 
of the most successful dances in the 
history of the schools.
KING LEAVES FOR PARIS.
W. B. King, Jr., was last Thursday 
saying goodbye to his many friends 
around school. He is now on his way 
to France, where he expects to study 
architecture for some time in the 
Ecole des Beaus Arts.

In last week’s Tartan it was an­
nounced that the issue of this week 
would be in the hands of the Senior 
classes. In as much as the commit­
tee in charge desired more time for 
preparation, the Senior Issue has been 
postponed.
This will be the last issue of the 
Tartan for the year of 1911. When 
we gather together again a new year 
will have come upon us, a year car­
rying potential promises of greatness. 
The year departed leaves behind ac­
complishments in the betterment of 
our Alma Mater. But every work of 
the past is incomplete unless sus­
tained by the present and that is our 
responsibility. We have much for 
which to be thankful, for we are the 
recipients of rich gifts. It is strength­
ening to know that we represent so 
much confidence and trust and to 
enter into such a rich inheritance as 
this newr year holds in store for us. 
Let us begin it as it should be begun, 
soberly, bravely, and determinedly. 
Forgetful always of petty annoy­
ances, let us fix upon the goal, the 
fulfillment of our trusts, and run our 
race. In this way only can we justify 
ourselves and make the year 1912 the 
greatest in the history of the Carnegie 
Technical Schools.
The Tartan wishes all a very Merry 
Christmas and a Happy Xew Year.
—o—
A knocker can be differentiated 
from a booster in that the one is de­
structive in his thoughts, and the 
other constructive. One is a tearer- 
down and contemptible; the other a 
builder-up and admirable. The one 
takes no courage; the other calls for 
much of it.
The Tartan aims to be constructive 
and a builder-up always and destruc­
tive and a tearer-down never. In the 
attaining of this aim the student-body 
can be of material assistance to the
Tartan Board. If you do not always 
agree with us, write a letter and tell 
us so and in what particular you 
differ. . If you know of something 
which you think needs remedying, 
write and tell us about it, giving the 
remedy you think necessary. While 
such letters should be signed to re­
ceive attention, they will not be pub­
lished if the writer does not so de­
sire.
CONCERNING TARTAN MATE­
RIAL.
Those who have material that they 
desire to have published in the Tar­
tan are requested to place the same 
in the Tartan boxes by Friday after­
noon in order that it may receive at­
tention and be used, if possible, in 
the issue of the following week. Ow­
ing to the limited space at the dis­
posal of the Tartan Board and the 
amount of material to be gone over 
each week, that which is received first 
receives first attention.
Director and Mrs. Hamerschlag ex­
tend a cordial invitation to a Christ­
mas Night party at their home, on 
Monday, December twenty-fifth, at 
eight p. m., to non-resident students 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools, 
wTho will not be_ able to get to their 
own homes during the Holidays. The 
party will be informal and we hope 
all of these students will send a word 
of acceptance of this invitation before 
December 20, 1910, to the Director’s 
home or office.
ANNOUNCEMENT OF SCHOLAR­
SHIP.
Four to be Given Next Year.
There will be announced for the 
next school year an entrance scholar­
ship for each of the four schools. The 
terms of the competition for these 
scholarships will be developed by each 
faculty. These scholarships should 
bring the quality of the work along 
by this institution to the attention of 
a wide circle of students and will give 
to some scholars of exceptional tal­
ents, who otherwise could not finance 
a first year’s work, an opportunity to 
secure a higher education.
These will be the first scholarships 
ever offered by this institution and, 
while nothing definite has been an­
nounced, it is expected that they will 
include all tuition and laboratory fees 
as well as a sum of money. Each fac­
ulty will work out conditions for their 
particular . school and the Tartan 
hopes to announce in the near future 
just what these conditions will be.

NEXT WEEK IN 
THE THEATERS
ALVIN—There is an open week at 
the theater to be filled by the Jew­
ish actress, Mme. Lipzin, on Monday 
night, and the Kinemacolor pictures 
of the Coronation for the rest of the 
week.
NIXON—Lulu Glaser will be seen

DUQUESNE — Camille will be 
played by Mary Hall and the Stock

LYCEUM—Thomas E. Shea in rep­
ertoire will be at this theater.
GRAND—The juvenile comedian, 
Little Billie, will head the list of vau­
deville.
CHARETTE WEEK IN THE 
SHANTY.
The working drawings for the new 
Design building were completed last 
week and are now in the hands of 
the contractor. For several days the 
drawings could be examined in the 
shanty, where comments on unusual 
features of the next building to be 
added to the group were many and 
varied. The estimated cost of the 
building is over $400,000, and a good 
idea of the excellent equipment and 
completeness of everything is gained 
from its stated cost.
It is interesting to note that a ma­
jority of the men who worked on Mr. 
Hornbostel’s drawings, either are at 
present working or have worked in 
the past in the course in Architecture 
of the School of Applied Design.
The help of these men has been 
most valuable to the design students 
in school, when on charette, and they 
will be materially missed when they 
go.-----------o-----------
SECOND YEAR NIGHT CLASS 
HOLDS SMOKER.
On Saturday evening, December 
9th, the Second Year Night Class, Sci­
ence, held its first smoker of the sea­
son in the “Beanery.” Owing to in­
clement weather, there were not as 
many fellows out as was expected, 
but, nevertheless, a very enjoyable 
and pleasant time was spent by all.
Pipes were lit up and festivities 
commenced about 8:30 p. m. by some 
of the popular songs being played on 
the piano, accompanied by several 
stringed instruments. It was with 
great pleasure to all that Mr. Loner- 
gan, one of our ex-members, was 
present, who added to the merriment 
of the evening by giving a recitation 
which was roundly applauded. Mr. 
Gormley was also warmly applauded 
for his masterly manner in reading 
several select verses of poetry relating 
to the Yukon. During the evening a 
couple of boxing bouts were pulled 
off, Messrs. Floyd and Koenig carry­
ing away the honors for fancy spar­
ring. Refreshments were served about 
ten o’clock, and it is needless to say 
that all of the fellows did full justice 
to the “eats.”
As a souvenir of the occasion, each 
fellow was presented with a fancy 
clay pipe of the English type.
NOTICE.
There will be posted this week on 
the bulletin boards of the four schools 
proof sheets of the student list for 
the new catalogue. Each student is 
requested to examine these proofs 
carefully, and if an error or omission 
occurs in connection with his name 
to report it at once, in writing, to the 
Dean’s office. As the catalogue will 
go to press during the last week of 
December, it is urged that students 
hand in their corrections before the 
beginning of the Christmas recess, 
December 15th.

It is with great sorrow that 
we announce the death of Miss 
Gail Kiefer, daughter of Mr. 
and Mrs. W. I. Kiefer, of Find­
lay, Ohio, on December 4th,
1911.
Miss Kiefer had been suffer­
ing from an attack of typhoid 
fever for several weeks, but her 
condition, while of course seri­
ous, was not considered dan­
gerous, and her return to her 
accustomed place in her Class 
was looked forward to at no 
distant day.
Last Monday morning the 
news of her sudden death, un- 
Jooked for by family and friends, 
came as a severe shock to every 
person in the School, but most 
particularly was it felt by her 
companions and friends in the 
Junior Class, of which she was 
a member.

4THE TARTAN
CRAWFORD ELECTED CAPTAIN 
OF NEXT YEAR’S FOOT­
BALL SQUAD.
On Wednesday of last week the 
members of the Varsity football team 
donned their uniforms for the last 
time this season and gathered on the 
field for the squad picture. While 
waiting for the "birdie” to prepare 
for flight, a lively snow-ball battle 
was indulged in. For a time, the 
coaches lined up against the team, 
and the fellows were given a chance 
to “get back” for some of the events 
of the season. The three experts held 
their own, however, and the bunch 
was quieted enough to allow the man 
behind to get several shots.
Immediately afterward the team 
gathered in Dr. Marks’ office and 
elected their leader for next year. 
Frank S. Crawford, of Pittsburgh, was 
the unanimous choice of the squad.
Crawford, who is a Junior Metal­
lurgist in the School of Applied Sci^ 
ence, held down the position of left 
tackle in every game' of the season, 
without losing a second of time. He 
played a consistently excellent game 
throughout the year, showing 
strength, speed and endurance at all 
periods. During the season of 1908 
he was a member of the squad, but 
failed to make his letter by a fraction 
of a game played. As a member of 
ths historic team of 1909, he played 
the position of tackle in a way that 
made him a considerable factor in the 
team’s success. He remained out of 
school during 1910, returning this 
fall.
Crawford has the confidence of all 
of this year’s team and will undoubt­
edly make a good leader. He stands 
high in his classes and will never be 
in danger of being taken off the squad 
because of deficiencies. The Tartan 
joins his teammates in wishing him 
a successful season.
By a peculiar coincidence, S. James 
Taylor, the retiring captain, is also 
a Junior Metallurgist, and ascribes 
part of his success to that fact. The 
greater part of his success is due to 
his earnestness and hard work, as 
well as to the fact that he has proven 
to be one of the best centers of West­
ern Pennsylvania.
The Tartan regrets that a picture 
of the team could not be secured for 
publication in this issue, but it will 
undoubtedly appear in an early num­
ber.
INDOOR TRAINING TO START.
Manager Franks, of the track team, 
has announced that indoor training 
will start immediately after the holi­
days. It is his intention to enter a team 
in the best indoor meets of the win­
ter, in case enough men report for 
practice. Two events of interest will 
be the annual Y. M. C. A. meet at 
the Gardens on February 16, and the 
P. A. A. meet on March 2.
While no place of training has been 
secured yet, the management expects 
to be able to announce such a place 
before long. Care is being taken that 
facilities for dressing and baths may 
be included with the hall.
