I.M. Field Lights
To Be Ready Soon
The long-awaited light towers on the intramural 
field should be completed within the next few weeks, 
according to Lewis C. Mechling, assistant director 
for engineering planning and construction at Carne­gie Tech.
Plans call for four towers, each 
having two banks of lights atop a 
wooden pole. These towers will be 
set up along the sidelines of the 
football (or soccer) fields — two 
on the edge of the field along For­
bes Avenue, and two on the edge 
adjoining the Margaret Morrison 
Street parking lot. Once the lights 
are up, “teams will be able to 
play till nine or ten o'clock at 
night; if necessary,” says Mech­
ling.
Construction is being done by the 
Morganstern Electric Company, 
and should cost 25 to 30 thousand 
dollars. Originally the towers were 
to be completed by March 1, but 
difficulty in obtaining the wood­
en poles caused a delay.
The poles and equipment have 
been at Carnegie Tech for over 
a week now, but construction crews 
have not been able to start work 
because of wet weather. Mechler 
explained that the field would get 
torn up badly by the electric com­
pany’s heavy construction equip­
ment if the job were to be started 
while the ground was damp and soft.
In good weather, Morganstern 
Co. could complete the towers in 
two weeks. Because of the pro­
posed location of the lights, the 
work should not interfere with any
I. M. softball games.

Times Acclaims Kiltie Band; 
Lindsay Sends Welcome
The Carnegie Tech Kiltie Symphony Band com­
pleted its Spring Tour, featuring a concert in New 
York’s Town Hall on April 14. Mayor Robert Lind­
say, invited to the concert by the New York Alumni 
Clan, was unable to attend, but extended a warm 
welcome to the band and its director, Dr. Richard 
E. Strange, via telegram.
The band will present 
May 1 in Carnegie Music 
from the tour.
In response to the town Hall 
concert, New York Times critic 
Robert Sherman responded with 
the following review in the April 
15 New York Times:
Tartan Changes Editors; 
Sextro Replaces Melhado
The Tartan has shuffled its editorial staff in preparation for the Fall 1966. 
Replacing Evan M. Melhado as Tartan editor-in-chief is Richard G. Sextro.
Sextro, former business and advertising manager, is a junior majoring 
in chemistry. A member of Delta Skull, junior men’s honorary, he is on the 
Freshman Camp staff and the undergraduate advisory and engineering & sci­
ence dean’s advisory committees. He also belongs to the Explorer’s Club.
With regard to the future of the Tartan, Sextro says: “The Tartan will, in 
the coming year, expand its present news coverage, and most importantly, 
help establish a better report between the students and the Administration.”
Another change in organization 
involved the naming of Sue Attin- 
son, past news and desk editor, 
to the new post of Executive Edi­
tor. Miss Attinson, junior, tech­
nical writing plans to initiate se­
veral -Tartan campaigns regard­
ing major campus problems. As 
an extension of the Nature Of The 
University series, she and her 
assistants, Candy Etkin and Liz 
Seley (past Tartan news editors) 
will investigate Administrative 
opinions and their effect on the 
student body.
Also in a newly - titled posi­
tion is Eric Feldman, Sophomore 
IM, one-time business mana­
ger. As managing editor, Feld­
man hopes to improve coordina­
tion between the various Tartan 
staffs so as to permit more con­
centration on coverage and con­
tent.
Past secretarial editor, Judy 
Birken, junior, IM, has replaced 
Sextro as business manager; Di­
ane Cushing, sophomore, busi­
ness, will take over her post.
Michael Vargo, former sports 
editor, junior, mechanical engin­
eer, now directs the news staff 
and Bruce Gelin, junior, chemis­
try edits from the desk.
David P. Rodgers, junior, elec­
trical engineer, directs both the 
layout and circulation staffs, as­
sisted by layout editor Marcy 
Stern, sophomore, home econo­
mics. Pat Bowman, freshman, 
English, takes care of the nation­
al advertising.
The new editors will publish 
four more papers this semester. 
Anyone interested in helping out 
this spring or next fall should 
contact the respective editor, care 
of the Tartan Office, Skibo 50,
CIT Delegates
Discuss Urban 
Challenges
Tom Glassberg, senior, Mech­
anical Engineering, and Bob Bla- 
sier, junior, Industrial Manage­
ment, attended a conference on 
“The Urban Challenge” at Mas­
sachusetts Institute of Technolo­
gy from Wednesday, April 13 to 
Friday, April 16,
Along with students from 80 
other colleges, they heard lectur­
es by prominent architects, en­
gineers, and politicians and dis­
cussed topics such as urban re­
newal, public transportation, and 
the future of the metropolis.
Glassberg, representing the col­
lege of Engineering and Science 
at Carnegie Tech, and Blasier, 
representing Industrial Manage­
ment and the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration, were 
chosen as Carnegie Tech’s de­
legates to the conference by Dean 
Brown and various department 
heads.
a free public concert on 
Hall, Oakland, with music
With a swirl of colors and 
the skirl of bagpipes, the Car­
negie Tech Kiltie Symphony 
Band made its New York debut 
last night at Town Hall.
Dressed in kilts, sporrans, 
spats and sundry other acouter- 
ments of Scottish parapherna­
lia, the 85 young men from the 
Carnegie Institute of Technolo­
gy in Pittsburgh (and their 30 
soberly dressed distaff colleag­
ues) filled the stage to over­
flowing. In fact, the nine pipers 
who started things off with a 
spirited medley of traditional 
tunes played from the auditori­
um floor.The costumes, of course, are 
but an adjunct, and the band
quickly settled down to an eve­
ning of solid music-making. 
It covered the gamut from Wag­
ner’s eloquent “Trauersinfon- 
ie” to the zesty circus march 
“Thunder and Blazes.” Among 
the inevitable transcriptions 
was the allegro movement from 
Vivaldi’s B Flat Concerto for 
Two Trumpets, in which 
soloists Mark Schrello and Te­
rence Detwiler did themselves 
and their alma mater proud.
If it comes to that, so did all 
the young musicians. They per­
formed with spirit, with gene­
rally good intonation and with 
remarkable flexibility, con­
sidering the unwieldy size of 
the ensemble. Richard E. 
Strange, the conductor, was in 
firm command throughout, 
drawing from his players rich 
sonorities and an impressive 
range of dynamic shadings.

Tipker Obtains Clarification 
Of Grad Deferment Policy
Clarification of Selective Service System (SSS) poli­
cies regarding deferment of graduate students was ob­
tained last week by George Tipker, head of men’s 
housing in the Carnegie Tech Division of Student Af­
fairs.
Colonel Prosser at Selective Service headquarters 
in Washington, D.C. informed Tipker that to continue 
his studies, a graduate student is not required to 
achieve a score of 80 or better on the qualifier test, 
nor must he have been in the upper quarter of his 
class during his last undergraduate year.
Carnegie Tech and many other 
schools across the country, accor­
ding to Tipker, have interpreted 
information supplied by the SSS to 
mean that these requirements 
have been in effect.
The only criterion for grant­
ing student deferment to graduate 
students is that his academic per­
formance in graduate school be 
satisfactory as reported by that 
school. Tipker emphasized, how­
ever, that the SSS permits two 
years for the completion of a mas­
ter’s degree and a total of five 
years for the doctorate.
Students now completing their 
last undergraduate year and who 
plan to attend graduate school must 
either rank in the upper quarter 
of their graduating class or achieve 
a score of 80 or better on the qua­
lifying test, Tipker said. Tipker 
urged students who have been ac­
cepted at a graduate school to ob­
tain letters indicating their ac­
ceptances and send them to their 
local draft boards immediately.

Sound Off
The Male Campanion
by Howard Lasnik
It hardly matters that if you 
puncture the surface of “Hie Male 
Companion,” you discover abso­
lutely nothing. The surface is so 
imaginative, colorful and altoge­
ther delightful that on its strength 
alone the movie stands as excellent 
entertainment.
Director Philippe de Broca(That 
Man From Rio), sustains a very ef­
fective liesurely - hurried pace. 
Hurried, because many things hap­
pen in many places to hero An­
toine played in suitably charming 
fashion by Jean - Pierre Cassel. 
But Antoine rarely hurries and 
never works. He is the embodi­
ment of his motto, “Everything 
devine is effortless.” For he ob­
tains everything he desires through 
his charm — not through severe 
James Bond - like suavity, but 
merely light boyish charm.
Antoine is accustomed to luxu­
ry, but his extravagant grandfa­
ther, with whom he has been liv­
ing, has died, leaving only enough 
in property to pay the inheritance 
taxes. Unfazed, Antoine repeatedly 
finds painless and laborless sour­
ces of room, board, and less mun­
dane commodities. To heighten the 
effect of Antoine’s character, he is 
placed in situations near “work­
ers”. First there is Balthazer, 
whose motto is “ze struggle for
life”, and who winds up helping 
Antoine to steal his girlfriend, 
and later, the rich tycoon played by 
Marcel Dalio whom Antoine teach 
es how to relax.
Extremely effective throughout 
the film is the stylization of speech 
and movement reminiscent of Gi- 
raudoux’s dramatic technique. 
Balthazar as he peddles snapshots 
performs almost a ballet. And the 
wild party scene near the end is 
not so near to farce as to dream. 
The splendid colors provide an 
additional visual treat. Antoine’s 
costumes especially are irresis- 
table.
Antoine encounters many wom­
en throughout the movie but there 
is one, played by Catherine De­
neuve (Umbrellas of Cherbourg, 
Repulsion), who always eludes him. 
Her appearances provide a unifying 
motif. When he finally finds her 
he seems to settle down, amazing­
ly enough, as the ordinary mill- 
worker about whom he had a night­
mare at the beginning of the movie. 
“Seems to”, that is, for the dream­
like atmosphere of the whole movie 
couldn’t allow so final an end.
All in all, “ITie Male Compan­
ion” is a delight. Escapist, cer­
tainly, but technically for better 
than most “serious” movies.

Editorial
Housing Policy
A furor developed recently among the residents 
of Morewood Gardens when the apartment rental costs 
were announced before the Easter recess. Since that 
time, rumors as to the rationale behind the prices have 
spread rapidly. However, these prices have been de­
veloped from a cost analysis by Mr. Richard D. 
Strathmeyer, vice-president for business affairs, 
and Mr. J. Leslie Hicks, Manager of business affairs. 
According to Mr. Strathmeyer, the actual operating 
expenses for the Colonial Manor Apartments is based 
on that of a private service company which has been 
under contract to Tech for the past year to service 
Colonial Manor. Thus, these costs were ascertained 
independent of Carnegie Tech management or judg­
ment. However, these costs will decrease slightly 
because students will now occupy the building for only 9 
to 10 months a year instead of the previous 12 month 
occupancy.
Two other considerations were made in computing 
the rent for Colonial Manor, both of them amortized 
over an eight to ten year period. The first of these 
is the amortized mortgage payment of nearly $18,-
000 which was made at the time Tech purchased the 
Manor three years ago. Secondly, nearly $9500 per 
year has been allocated for furnishings, as selected 
by a committee of students who met with Mr. Hicks. 
As a result of this analysis, Tech must receive $2400 
per apartment in the Manor in order to realize their 
present objective of maintaining student housing on a 
no loss, no gain basis.
Several questions have arisen in regard to this 
policy. As to the question of subletting the apartments 
during the summer, Mr. Strathmeyer explained that the 
number of people affiliated with Tech, either faculty, 
or summer session students, that would be willing to 
rent these apartments for the summer months is very 
small. If the apartments were to be opened up to 
the general public, Tech would risk loosing it’s present 
income tax exemption based on the fact that student 
housing is affiliated directly with the school, a non­
profit, tax-exempt organization.
Although this price policy is in keeping with the 
school’s philosophy, as expounded by Mr. Strath­
meyer, of “providing a range of facilities and a range 
of prices in order to encourage and facilitate young 
people’s education, rather than impede it by inade­
quate housing,’ ’ one might question the need for school- 
owned apartments. In light of the monetary require­
ments Colonial Manor demands, perhaps abetter solu­
tion might be found by simply encouraging women to 
move into off-campus housing, which would, in most 
cases, prove to be considerably less expensive than 
that provided by the school. Or, in the case that there 
is demand for school-owned apartment-type housing, 
the school might investigate the possibility of securing 
cheaper apartment housing.
Finally, in view of the fact that at present, the sign­
up list for occupancy in the Colonial Manor is consi­
derably smaller than the number required for the 
minimum occupancy, Tech may be forced into review­
ing the policies surrounding this recent move to find 
a more satisfactory solution. /
The Search 
For Understanding
by James Ponepinto
Draft Interest
Several weeks ago a draft ques­
tionnaire appeared in the Tartan 
in hopes that the effect of the 
new Selective Service test on Tech 
students might be judged. Hie re­
sults that were obtained do not pro­
vide any definite conclusions, but 
this was not the primary purpose 
of the questionnaire. It was hop­
ed that at least a partial indica­
tion of the feelings of Carnegie 
Tech male undergraduates would 
be obtained, and that possibly a 
strong enough response would 
occur if the issue was critical 
enough.
At best, a partial indication can 
be obtained from the results. A 
large majority of the respondents 
fell in the 18-21 year old bracket, 
but the freshman, sophomore, jun­
ior and senior classes were al­
most equally represented. Most 
of the people who responded had 
factors between 2.0 and 3.0, even 
though a few responded from ei­
ther extreme. About 75% of the 
respondents agreed that the pre­
sent draft selection system was 
unfair, but only about half of these 
persons felt that the new draft 
selection test increased inequity 
in the selective service system.
Over half of the students who 
responded felt that the test would 
affect them significantly in certain 
respects. Hiere was a strong in­
dication that students with factors 
between 2,01 and 2.5 would no

Our Brother’s Brother
Since World War II, the Federal 
government has been increasingly 
involved in aiding the underdeve­
loped and impoverished people in 
our country and the rest of the 
world. Unfortunately our foreign 
aid programs usually have been 
mismanaged, wrongly directed, 
and disproportionately costly. The 
same is true of domestic help 
programs as most recently eviden­
ced in the War on Poverty and its 
stumbling bureaucracy. And so it 
was with great interest that we 
learned of an organization called 
World Neighbors which runs a 
large efficient foreign aid program 
on a small budget entirey finan­
ced by non-governmental sources. 
In fact, 75% of the yearly budget 
of $400,000 is contributed by in­
dividuals, with the remainder cov­
ered by churches, civic groups, 
and service organizations.
World Neighbors was founded in 
1952 in Oklahoma City by a group 
of businessmen after hearing 
an address by Dr. John L. Peters, 
the organization’s president. Dr. 
Peters, a graduate of Yale Uni­
versity, was a combat Chaplain 
in the Phillippines and Korea. 
The personal contacts he made and 
the living conditions he saw caus­
ed him to dedicate his life to im­
proving those conditions.
But this is no give-away charity 
institution. Dr. Peters says “We 
give nothing but advice. We ope­
rate with revolving loans, so the 
people can keep their self-respect 
and become independent of us.’ 
World Neighbors is involved only at 
the village level where the need is 
greatest. But the features which 
most distinguish World Neighbors 
from all other aid programs are 
the method of project selection, 
and the high percentage of nationals 
employed in the overseas opera­
tions. World Neighbors goes into 
an area only when some type of 
program has been started and 
needs help, or when specifically 
invited by village leaders. This, 
combined with the hiring of nation­
als to run many projects, insures 
that the aid will be appreciated 
and efficiently dispensed.
When the project is self-suf­
ficient the World Neighbor volun-
w’ith factors from all areas indi­
cated that competition would be 
more intense and that they would 
be forced to study harder.
Often coupled with this was and 
indication that the level of anxie­
ty of the student concerning 
his academic success was signi­
ficantly increased. On the other 
hand, it should be pointed out that 
close to half of the respondents 
felt that the new Selective ser­
vice procedure wouldn’t effect 
them significantly. Similarly, 
about half of the respondents 
were In favor of the Administra­
tion (of Carnegie Tech and other 
colleges) Issuing a statement cri- 
tlciquing the new Selective Ser­
vice Examination and asking for 
its repeal.
This article only intended to 
summarize the results of the 
questionnaire. Unfortunately, a 
larger sample was not obtained 
in that a better indication of stu­
dent feelings resulted. One con­
clusion that can be drawn is that 
Carnegie Tech students are not 
overly concerned with the draft 
and see little need in expressing 
their opinion.
In fact, it is difficult for this 
writer to see significant involve­
ment among Carnegie Tech stu­
dents in events of major social, 
political, or economic impor­
tance, After Spring vacation, I will 
begin a concerted effort to de­
termine what Carnegie Tech stu­
dents are actually concerned about 
and if there are changes in the 
college community which would 
make them more obtained.

teer or paid worker leaves, be­
cause, as Dr. Peters says, “Our 
objective is to help them get to the 
point where they no longer need 
us. Our job is to lay the foun­
dation stones, and we do it by 
spending dimes, not dollars. We 
are not trying to build an em­
pire or an institution.” Except 
in extreme emergencies, aid is in 
the form of long term low interest 
loans.
In addition to helping financial­
ly in small hand-craft industries 
and farming, World Neighbor 
workers also introduce health pro­
grams and adult education. Al­
though the organization is largely 
church - sponsored it is non - 
sectarian and does no missionary 
work except on the level of promot­
ing good will and brotherhood be­
tween peoples.
World Neighbors, with a staff 
of 2800, is now running nearly 100 
projects in 18 countries in Africa, 
Asia, and South America on its 
budget of $400,000. TTiey have 
been able to operate on a limit­
ed budget because they have ask­
ed people to do things for them­
selves rather than do it for them. 
But the main products have been 
the pride and dignity of the villa­
ger who has helped himself. As 
Dr. Peters put it, “We should be 
our brother’s brother, not our 
brother’s keeper.”
Grant Aids 
History Study
Carnegie Tech has been award­
ed a grant from the Carnegie 
Corporation of New York.
The purpose of the $477,000 
grant is to continue and expand a 
cooperative program in history 
with predominately Negro colleges 
and other small liberal arts col­
leges.
The grant will support a three- 
year program at Carnegie Tech, 
which is aimed at giving faculty 
members from the institutions the 
opportunity to increase their sub­
ject competence, to develop new 
curricular materials, and to iden­
tify themselves as teachers and 
professionals in their fields.
The program which will end 
December 31, 1966 includes two 
summer institutes with a total of 
86 persons, graduate study in cur­
riculum work and teaching for 
sixteen students, development of 
new curricular materials for in­
troductory courses in American 
History and Western Civilization 
and cooperative work to streng­
then ties between Negro and other 
historians.
The program is under the direc­
tion of David H. Fowler and Lud­
wig F. Schaefer, associate pro­
fessors of history at Carnegie 
Tech.

From The Middle Of The Bus
By Michael Malakoff
A Rebuttal
Nature of the University
Tech Architecture Shows
Campus Expansion Policies
Many years ago, before the sound of bagpipes came to Pittsburgh, Schenley 
Park knew no bounds. The freight train pulling through Panther Hollow as it 
heads toward Erie for another load of coal for the mills could very well, at that 
time, have chugged right through the Doherty Hall parking lot and set a colli­
sion course for Woodlawn had not Squirrel Hill been in the Way.
For at its inception, Carnegie Tech was the proud possessor of a real cut ~ 
a tributary of Panther Hollow cutting in behind Doherty Hall, sinking the 
fence, the tennis courts, Margaret Morrison, Tech Bowl and the IM field. 
In fact at the present low point in that area, which happens to be a man-hole 
at the northwest corner of the tennis courts, the original level is yet 80 feet 
below the surface.
As I reflect upon Mr Mitchel's 
March 23rd letter to the editor, 
I try to think who are the “real 
social reformers” whose work 
“summer workers” set back 
“several years.” Unfortunately, 
Mr. Mitchel gave no examples of 
those to whom he was referring.
I can think of many local Ne­
gro Mississippians who I consider 
to be “real social reformers.” 
Some of the more outstanding local 
Mississippi Negroes I am refer­
ring to would include Mrs. Wheat­
on, Mrs. Hamer, and Mrs. Gray 
who were candidates for Congress. 
Charles Evers, past NAACP Sec­
retary, and James Chaney, to name 
two more, were shot to death by 
white Mississippi citizens for their 
efforts in social reform. The list 
could extend down to the thousands 
of local Negroes, born and raised 
in Mississippi, who currently par­
ticipate in the Mississippi 
Freedom Democratic Party.
As for white Mississippi so­
cial reformers in the area of 
integration, I can think of only a 
few. Professor Silver instructed 
at the University of Mississippi 
for fifteen years and is a past 
president of the Southern Histori­
cal: Association. For his book, The 
Closed Society, which describes 
the events leading up to and af­
ter September 30, 1962 when Ja­
mes Meredith was refused ad­
mittance to the University, Pro­
fessor Silver’s life, property and 
family were put in such jeopardy 
that he was forced to leave the 
state. All the social workers I 
„have mentioned, Negro and white, 
encourage white summer volun­
teers to come to Mississippi.
Pm sure that some students, as 
Mr. Mitchel suggested, do go down 
South for the adventure, but they 
soon see a greater meaning for 
being there. After becoming sett­
led in a community they begin to 
teach Negroes to read and write. 
Local Negroes for the first time 
are encouraged, tp think for and 
express themselves in “freedom 
schools” where they learn what 
freedom is and the responsibility 
and rights they have as American 
citizens. Some qualified volunteers 
become involved with informing 
local Negroes of their right to re-
Student Guides
Guides are needed for the over­
seas students who will be attend­
ing Carnegie Tech next year.
Those interested should obtain 
application blanks from the Y Of­
fice or from various bulletin boards 
around campus. Their student's 
name, matched by department if 
possible, will be sent early in the 
summer to enable pre-school cor­
respondence.
Guides must have been on cam­
pus for at least a year. They 
should make plans to meet with 
their students early in Septem­
ber and Introduce them to Car­
negie Tech.
Power Conference
Carnegie Tech junior engineer­
ing students William R. Godoski, 
and David Ver Planck, and assis­
tant professor of electric en­
gineering, Dr. Kurt G. Fehrle, 
will be guest of West Penn Pow­
er Company at the 28th Annual 
American Power Conference at 
Chicago, April 26 - 28.
The conference (a national Fo­
rum concerning matters of interest 
to the power Industry and associat­
ed groups) is sponsored by the 
Illinois Institute of Technology with 
the cooperation of various univer­
sities and technical societies.
gister their children in “integrat­
ed” schools and to apply for a job 
at previously segregated work­
ing places. Most of those involved 
arrive at a better understanding 
of themselves and of others. I fail 
to see how these activities set back 
any “real lasting social changes,” 
as Mr. Mitchel suggested.
Although I do not recall claim­
ing to know how many local Mis­
sissippians feel, even the casual 
observer could see how they be­
have. Non - humanitarian acts 
against Civil Rights workers, al­
though not openly praised by most 
local white Mississippians are 
certainly not condemned. In the 
city of Jackson, where Mr. Mitchel 
resides, I saw many acts of cio- 
lence by the police against civil 
rights workers. There were very 
few days I spent in jail in which 
at least one of us was not beaten 
unconscious by the police. We 
were deprived such basic needs as 
food, toilets, and beds. Appalling 
as it may seem, these inhuman ac­
tions were not only directed against 
men but also against women.
One only has to pick up the 
New York Times to read about 
many other acts of violence in­
cluding the bombing of churches 
and the killings of ministers in 
Mississippi. Can we soon forget 
the brutal death of Andrew Good­
man and Michael Schwerner and 
the involvement of Mississippi 
Sheriff Rainey and Deputy Sheriff 
Cecil Price, to name but one 
more example.
These men who beat and kill 
people in the name of the law, I 
feel, is some indication of the 
white environment in which, one 
is brought up in Mississippi. It 
took outside intervention to stop 
these unconstitutional acts. The 
Federal Government put an injunc­
tion on Jackson, Mississippi’s 
State capital, this summer to pre­
vent the city's leaders from viola­
ting the rights of Americans. Since 
then the city has been sued 
successfully for their acts against 
American citizens. That Mr. Mit­
chel is not “well versed” (as he 
claims) on this subject is appar­
ent and is understandable to the 
extent that many Nazis in Ger­
many claim they did not know 
about the mass genicide of the 
Jews that their government was 
carrying on. It is tragic that In­
sanity, not sanity, Ignorance, not 
reason, and hate, not love, both 
rule and populate the state of 
Mississippi.

International ID
Information about how to obtain 
an International European student 
identity card is now available In

This card may enable one to

It took a well-known architect 
by the name of Hornbostle to con­
ceive of bridging that cut with fill 
to allow for Carnegie Tech’s ex­
pansion, which then consisted of 
the original ship of learning, with 
prow behind Hammershlag Hall 
and stern the Fine Arts building.
Doherty Facade 
In the 1940’s the “Kealy Revi­
sion” was affected, which put a 
new front on Doherty Hall and had 
plans to complete the northwest 
corner of the quad before being 
scrapped by the Board of Trust­
ees. It was during this time, inci- 
dently, that the University, under 
Doherty, took over the mortgages 
of the fraternity houses that they 
might continue to function despite 
the red ink on the books caused 
by a drop in membership during 
the war.
It was the hope of Hornbostle, 
that the campus, or at least the 
quadrangle, would remain archi­
tecturally continuous.
As part of the 1957-67 Develop­
ment Plan, the Hunt Library and 
Skibo were built, the campus was 
landscaped, peripheral parking 
was conceived and executed, and 
now the new Administration Build­
ing.
Skibo used to be an airplane

Team Quarters
According to one story, origi­
nally Donner hall was to be put 
where the library is today, but 
was relocated beside the football 
field in order to provide teams 
rooms for the football players. 
Also avoided was the placement of 
the new Administration building 
between Baker and Doherty Halls. 
The Campus Design Committee 
prevailed in their objection to 
breaking up the mall. As the new 
building is being constructed, it 
carries out the prevailing concept 
of peripheral expansion as oppos­
ed to “interior crowding.”
The most imminent new con­
struction under consideration at 
the present time is the Research 
Center to be placed as a contin­
uation of Doherty Hall to complete 
the “starboard bow” of the ship 
of learning.

3,rchitGct*The CDC, at first, submits a 
budget and a list of needs or goals 
of the building. Then R.D. Strath­
meyer, vice president for business 
affairs compiles a list of architects 
best qualified for the job under 
consideration, which he then sends 
to the CDC. The Committee recom­
mends one to the President and the 
Board of Trustees, with the Board 
producing the final choice, Strath­
meyer then gets together with 
the architect and the Users Com­
mittee, that is, a representation of 
those who will occupy the building.
The architect finally goes to 
work with an understanding of the 
conditions of the CDC and the needs 
of the users. Plans soon go to the 
CDC for approval. Unfortunately, 
some criticize the great amount 
of interplay and feedback that cre­
dits this procedure is too often 
offset by conflicts of “profession­
alism.”
Expansion
Looking toward the future, there 
are always new ideas going down 
on paper to locate projected build­
ings. Probable limits are consi­
dered, and individual departments 
are consulted as to their possible 
future needs. Besides the new re­
search buildings, reliable sources 
indicate that the plan for a new 
Dramatic Arts center is getting 
very warm. It is quite possible 
that the student proponents of a new 
addition to Skibo will have to back 
themselves up with cash in the 
form of a heretofore non-existent 
activities fee.
Skibo has in the past been de­
veloped through gifts only, and ap­
parently Christmas is a long 
way off. In the wasteland behind

dining and recreational facilities 
— keeping the old Morewood 
as dorm space, however.
Unfortunately the Pennsy RR 
must retain its right of way through 
Panther Hollow, so that any ex­
pansion of peripheral parking will 
have to be on the slope behind 
Hammerschlag Hall — perhaps in 
layers cut into the bank.
Still farther into the future we 
see possibilities for the Bureau
of Mines property and if we go as 
far as oblivion when Carnegie Tech 
becomes Pennsylvania Tech, 
a state-supported university, we 
might even take over part of the 
residential area north and east of 
the IM field.
Private Campus 
According to Strathmeyer, it is 
now generally agreed that Carnegie 
Tech must grow, the general con­
straint of this being the lack of 
resources. And apparently the on­
ly way that we can move is out­
ward in all directions. The main 
concept that is agreed upon by 
Strathmeyer and Dr. Stever, how­
ever, is that our campus remain 
physically private.
This concept was almost 
scrapped with the inception of the 
new administration building; its 
builders had recommended level­
ing of the cut for parking purpos­
es but the Administration refect­
ed the suggestion.

In a triangular meet with Indiana State and Geneva at Tech Field last Friday, 
the Carnegie Tech track team broke even for the day by coming in second. 
The Indiana team, turning in times and distances that Tech coach Ed Vamos 
called “unusually good for the kind of competition we are used to facing,*’ fi­
nished with a total of 87 points, Tech had 55, and Geneva scored 39.
The Tartans lost the meet in 
the field events. After sweeping 
second, third, and fourth places in 
the pole vault, they managed only 
eight points in the remaining six 
field contests.
Ficks of Indiana tied a Tech 
Field record in the high jump by 
clearing the bar at six feet, five 
inches. The first four finishers 
in this event all cleared more than 
six feet. Tech’s Ken Happach, re­
covering fron^a knee injury, jump­
ed five-ten.
Middle - distance runner Ken 
Batorski, another ailing Tartan 
running in his first meet of the 
season, took third in the 440 - 
yard dash and ran well in the mile 
relay.
Chris Macosko, Harry Burk­
holder, and Roger Cairns won the 
mile run for Tech in a blanket 
finish at 4:44.0. In the two-mile 
race, however, the Tartan cross­
country trio finished behind In­
diana’s Conte.
Two more home meets are 
scheduled for this week: West­
minster today at 3:30, and another 
triangular meet, with St. Fran­
cis and Waynesburg, Saturday at 
1:30. Coach Vamos hopes to have 
all his men in good health for 
the first time this year for to­
day’s meet, as the Tartans will 
be trying to avenge close loss­
es to Westminster in each of the 
last two seasons.
Results of the Indiana - Gene­
va meet are printed below. Scor­
ing in a 3-way meet is 5 points 
for first, 3 for second, 2 for third,

Tech’s tennis team split its first 
two meets of the season last week, 
beating Waynesburg 6-3 on Satur­
day after losing to Grove City 7 to

The Tartans won the Waynes­
burg meet by sweeping all three 
doubles matches. After Salim 
Khan and Leigh DeHuff won their 
doubles match 6-2, 6-2, Bob Lowe 
and Curt Chandler took two close 
games, 8-6 and 9-7, to clinch the 
victory. Then Fred Stone and Dick 
Londergan won 7-5, 6-2 to put icing 
on the cake. In the singles match- 
as Khan, Londergan, and Mike 
Smollens beat their opponents, 
while Lowe, DeHuff, and Chandler 
lost to theirs.
