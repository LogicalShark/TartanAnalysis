Last-Minute Student Protest 
Re-Claimed Thanksgiving
by Gretchen Smith
The four-day Thanksgiving recess officially begins tomor­
row afternoon.
Carnegie Tech students missed this vacation last year 
because classes were scheduled on the Friday following
Thanksgiving; the vacation was4- 
re-instated as a result of strong 
student appeal.
Until that time Homecoming 
activities were always held dur­
ing Fall Festival weekend and 
Friday of that weekend was al­
ways a holiday. Because the 
Alumni decided last year to move 
their Homecoming to June, the 
Executive Board of the adminis­
tration eliminated the Friday af­
ternoon holiday of Fall Festival,
This would avoid missing Friday 
classes twice during one semes­
ter.
Dr. John C. Warner
Passes Reins Next Year
by Dale Chodorow
Dr. John C. Warner, retiring president of Carnegie Tech, 
will deliver his last major address before the student body 
on December 8 at the 11:30 a.m. assembly in the Skibo Ballroom. ?--------------------------------------------
Student Congress, however, be­
lieved that students would rather 
retain Fall Festival as a vaca­
tion and have classes the Fri­
day after Thanksgiving. There­
fore, this plan was adopted.
A s Thanksgiving approached 
last year, students changed their 
minds, and appealed to the ad­
ministration through Student 
Congress to re-establish a Thanks­
giving recess. It was too late to 
make any changes last year, but 
the calendar for this year was 
revised to include this vacation.
Dean Brown, co-chairman of 
the Calendar committee, sees no 
reasons why Fall Festival Fri­
day and Friday after Thanks­
giving will not both be retained 
as holidays in the future.
He added, however, that if 
any major changes in the school 
calendar were to be made, one 
of these Fridays may have to 
be scheduled as a class day.
At the conclusion of his talk. Dr. 
Warner will introduce his succes­
sor, Dr. Horton G. Stever, who 
will assume the school’s presi­
dency February 1.
Dr. Warner became the 
fourth president of Carnegie 
Tech in 1950. He had been 
serving on the faculty Jince 
1926.
Among the many achievements 
of the retiring president, are the 
introduction of the interdiscipli­
nary approach to education, the 
initiation of Carnegie Tech’s 
computation center, the beginning 
of the advanced placement pro­
gram with Pittsblurgh area high 
schools, and the formation of the 
Graduate School of Industrial Ad­
ministration, which in 14 years, j 
has become recognized as a pio­
neer and innovator in industrial 
administration education.
Since Dr. Warner became presi­
dent, 14 new buildings have been 
constructed on campus, and the 
endowment of Carnegie Tech and 
value of its physical plant have 
doubled. The development pro-! 
gram which begin in 1957 has al-j 
ready raised 90% of the total goal 
of $29 million.
In addition, Dr. Warner has 
raised faculty salaries over 
100% during his 14-year term.
After receiving his B.A., M.A., 
and Ph. D. in chemistry at Indi-! 
ana University, Dr. Warner join­
ed the Carnegie Tech faculty in 
1926 as an instructor in chemis­
try. He later became professor j 
and head of the department of 
chemistry, a position he held until 
1949, when he was appointed 
vice-president. He also served as j 
dean of graduate studies from 
1945 to 1950.
Dr. Warner has served as a
member of the Manhatan Project 
from 1943 to 1945 and was a 
member of the General Advisory 
Committee of the United States 
Atomic Energy Commission from 
1952 until this year. In. 1958 he 
attended the Second United Na­
tions International Conference on 
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, 
in Geneva, as a technical con­
sultant to the U. S. delegation.
The December 8 assembly 
will mark, not only Dr. War­
ner’s last speech before the stu­
dent body, but also Dr. Stever's 
last appearance on campus be­
fore he assumes the presidency 
.next term.

S ’n S production, ‘Whatser- 
face,’ a musical by Iris Rat- 
ner and Lawrence Stevers will

Further The Goal
The 1964 Carnegie Tech Campus Chest drive will begin 
December 2.
Campus Chest advances today’s academic community on 
local, national, and international scales by supplying funds 
to further the educational needs of its members.
Campus Chest donates the money is collects to three 
areas. The first is the World University Service, which works 
to provide proper educational facilities for those who do not 
have them. The second, the National Scholarship Service and 
Fund for Negro Students, provides financial aid to promising 
Negro students who seek education but lack the financial 
means to obtain it. The third is a Special Tech Project. One 
portion of the funds collected will remain here to provide 
financial aid to a needy Carnegie Tech student.
We feel that every student on this campus has an obliga­
tion to support the Campus Chest drive. Certainly furthering 
the needs of our fellow students must be one of the aims of 
each student on this campus. We can help achieve the goal 
by contributing to Campus Chest.
Education is a major force in improving social relations 
and eliminating misunderstanding. Ignorance inevitably 
leads to prejudice and hatred. In our country and abroad 
ignorance causes racial and religious prejudices which result 
in violence.
Communism uses the ignorance of people as a tool for 
deception to aid in subversive activities. Education develops 
the ability to think objectively, broadens an individual’s out­
looks, and creates the desire to investigate situations thor­
oughly before arriving at conclusions or making commit­
ments.
It is necessary to broaden the society in which we are 
students and are preparing to live. The goal of eliminating 
ignorance and in turn, prejudice, hatred, and deception can 
be furthered by contributing to Campus Chest.
There are many talented people who could become valu­
able assets to our society but who, indeed, cannot because 
they lack the means to an education. Citizens of underdevel­
oped nations and citizens of our country whose socio-econo- 
mie station is low must be educated in order that our society 
can better benefit from their work.
We must strive then, toward providing educational faci­
lities for all who have the desire to learn. In this way we can 
hope to benefit from their talents. By giving to Campus 
Chest, Carnegie Tech students can help achieve this goal.
We recognize the value and necessity of education in our 
society. We realize that there are those members of the aca­
demic community who do not possess the means to become 
educated. As students we have an obligation to further their 
needs.
Campus Chest provides the means to help them.
Help reach the goal of 100% participation in Campus 
Chest.

In the past decade, racial problems have arisen as one of 
the most controversial issues in our society.

crimination toward the Negro.^ -----------------------
However, one major item which j

Molokoff Defines 
Fraternity Objectives
Editor, The Tartan:
After reading George R. Ma­
daras’ letter to the editor in the 
November 8 Tartan I was com­
pletely puzzled. Mr. Madaras 
seemed to classify fraternity wtih 
student bodies; sex or the lack of 
it with maturity, and the com­
bination of the four items with 
politics.
Mr. Madaras asks “what the 
true function of frats” are. A fra­
ternity is an ideal, it is a dream. 
A fraternity seeks to develop the 
individual to the fullest extent. 
Each member feels a commitment 
to this ideal and seeks to fulfill 
these commitments by putting 
them into action.
To be more explicit, a college 
fraternity’s “true functions” can 
be stated in the words of our 
president, J.C. Warner: “Part of 
campus life that aims to cooperate 
with Carnegie Tech in helping 
men students obtain our objectives 
for them in the areas of social 
and human relations, group living, 
and experience in leadership roles 
is the fraternity system,’ (Greek 
Life at Carnegie Pamplet, 1964.).
The fraternity system tries to 
obtain these objectives in various 
ways.
1. As a group organization it 
teaches men how to live and 
work together. It strives to train 
the minds and bodies of its 
members. Living in close con­
tact enables one to develop 
more consideration and a better 
understanding of the various 
facets of human relations.
2. The college fraternity, as one 
of its primary goals, seeks to 
improve scholarship. Fraterni­
ties try to foster an environment 
conducive to serious study by 
setting definite quiet hours and 
arranging help sessions with 
brothers more adept in certain 
fields. The Council of Frater­
nity Presidents currently spon­
sors a tutoring program for 
freshmen. It should be noted 
that the fraternity scholastic 
average has been well above the 
all mens scholastic average for 
the past several years.

3. As a business organization, the 
fraternity provides opportunity 
to learn sound financial prac­
tices and housekeeping methods. 
One learns the value of budgets 
and of fulfilling financial obli­
gations on time. Many fraterni­
ties handle over $30,000 each 
year on this campus. This allows 
for invaluable financial train­
ing in the fraternal years.
4. The college fraternity builds 
the moral and spiritual develop­
ment of the individual. Many 
fraternities are on an honor 
system which permits the fra­
ternity men to assume respon­
sibilities at his own discretion. 
This develops in one a keen 
sense of right and wrong.
5. As center of social life, the fra­
ternity seeks to develop the so­
cial graces, and the develop­
ment of courtesy and kindness. 
Goodi manners and good taste 
are stressed in the fraternal 
system.
members of a college commu­
nity responsibility in later life.
8. By developing those qualities of 
human understanding of com­
panionship, of kindness, frater­
nity men are better able to ap­
praise the basic values of life 
w?hich lead to good citizenship.
These are just a few of the 
areas in which fraternities actively 
participate. This list can be ex­
tensively lengthened. People can­
not live alone. Hermits live alone. 
The eight areas listed above are 
a result of one thing — organi­
zation.
Organization is the key word. 
Organization Is the basic secret 
to success. Fraternities are suc­
cessful because they are well 
organized. Organization only 
comes into existence when ma­
ture responsible people coop­
erate in fulfilling common ob­
jectives.
The college fraternity channels 
“creativity and vitality” into these 
eight areas and others. There is 
no “punch and cookie representa­
tives.” There is no “chairman of 
the committee of grasscutting.” 
There are representatives in vari­
ous athletic functions academic 
functions, etc. There are scholar­
ship chairmen.
Fraternities are where one can 
find training for the mind and 
body leading to good citizenship. 
These are the “true functions” of a 
college fraternity.

Editor, the Tartan:
Although the question posed by 
Mr. Madaras is a valid one, de­
serving an honest answer, it seems 
to have become lost somewhere in 
the presentation. I find it neces­
sary to first sort out the ideas 
presented, and then consider each 
separately.
The torpor is, 1 must admit, at 
an extremely high level on this 
campus, as it is on the majority of 
campuses in this country, although 
I do not find the situation nearly 
as critical in my environment as 
Mr. Madaras seems to in his.
Many American students do not 
take an active interest in their 
government, or, for that matter, 
any activity. However, I cannot 
accept participation in frenzied 
riots, or organization of radical 
groups as an absolute indication 
of maturity. But let us determine 
who is taking an active interest in 
his community, and in the pro­
blems facing the student of today.
A vast majority of the officers 
of the various organizations on 
campus, as well as the other cam­
pus leaders, such as members of 
the Executive Council of Student 
Congress, Student Court, the Un­
dergraduate Advisory Committee, 
etc., have one characteristic in 
common. Most of the key figures 
in campus activities are fraternity 
members. But it could be largely 
a coincidence that these people 
happen to be fraternity men.
In fact, this is generally the 
case. The type of student that is 
interested in fraternity life is also 
interested in other activities, and

Although the erample given are 
most amusing, they represent a 
complete misconception of the 
problems confronting the frater- 
A nity man. Although he would en- 
^ joy consideration of such questions 
as grass cutting and cookies, he is 
too engrossed in the formation of 
future rush policies and pledge

tivate any ideas he might have 
for improvement.
Political training? At no time 
during his career will the student’s

Madaras Letter Refuted 
With Counter Arguments
Editor, the Tartan:
Mr. George R. Madaras’ com­
ments about the true function of
fraternities in last week’s Tar­
tan were exceedingly interesting, 
although I disagree with him 
over just who is “batty.’
Maintaining that a fraternity’s 
function is to stifle creative spirit 
and rechannel it into a vast waste­
land of immaturity, he believes 
that student bodies should be 
more of a political force in our 
nation.
He cites Europe and Asia as 
worthy examples while conve­
niently neglecting to mention that 
the countries where students are 
most forceful are those with the 
worst living conditions and the 
greatest political constraints. Nor 
does he distinguish between stu­
dent bodies in general and Greek 
organizations. Perhaps he c’oes 
not know the difference.
Let us bemoan the fact that 
Tech Greeks are satisfied with 
their lot in life and therefore 
make poor political agitators. The 
Council of Fraternity Presidents, 
regrettably, has never sponsored 
riots, demonstrations, revolutions, 
rapes, pillages, or murders. Fur­
thermore, few of us even know 
how to make Molotov cocktails. 
I confess this clearly shows our 
immaturity and lack of good citi­
zenship we exhibit.
1 know of no fraternities who 
have “punch and cookies chair­
men.” Nor do we intend to elect 
them. Our officers are motivated, 
intelligent people. They manage 
what are, in effect, corporations, 
each taking in and laying out 
upwards of $50,000 a year.

IM Soccer Game Seen 
As Instance of Lost Values
Editor, the Tartan:
Last Friday, November 13th 
certainly was a black day for Car­
negie Tech! I witnessed on the IM 
soccer field one of the poorest 
displays of sportsmanship which 
I have seen in the past fourteen 
years at both a player and spec- 
tatot of soccer.
The specific match to which I 
refer pitted a talented Interna­
tional Club team against a frater­
nity team from Carnegie Tech. As 
the score increased rather rapidly 
in favor of the International Club, 
the resulting frustration of the 
American fraternity team assumed 
an ugly form.
Tripping, clipping:, shoving:, 
and punching: on the part of the 
American team soon resulted 
in several rather bloodied Inter­
national Club players. To add to 
this disgrace, the apathetic re­
action of the referee, based on 
ig;norance of the same or just 
plain indifference, was to do 
nothing: to halt the brutal, un­
warranted actions of the Amer­
ican team. Protests from the In­
ternational Club players to the 
referee fell on deaf ears.

As the final whistle sounded, the 
American team seemed somewhat 
stunned when most of the Inter­
national Club refused the tradi­
tional post game cordiality of 
shaking hands with them.
I remarked to one of the Amer­
ican players that he could have 
learned so much about the game of , 
soccer by carefully watching his J 
opponents on the International j 
Club. His answer was, “We have j 
to win first. Then we can take i 
time to learn.”
Is the yard stick of success 
measured by the number of 
medals on a man’s chest, the 
number of animal heads on his 
wall, or the number of empty 
trophies in his trophy case, Has 
this “win at all costs” attitude 
developed from our highly com­
petitive society? If so, there is 
a sickness of a society within 
all of us which needs some self 
clarification and treatment.
The seemingly isolated incident 
of the soccer game reminded me 
again that we do not have to go 
overseas to find the “Ugly Amer- J 
ican.” Frankly, J was ashamed to 
have to call these young Amer­
ican men my countrymen.

Tech Alumni IndustrialistSeason Ends On 1-8 Record;
The sputtering Carnegie Tech 
rifle team dropped their second 
match of the season to a much u improved Clarion team 1395 to 
k 1377. This was the Tartans poor­
est showing of the year and put 
quite a damper on pre-season 
hopes for another winning sea-
Only three C.I.T. shooters man­
aged to turn in creditable per­
formances. Bqb Fritz fired the 
high individual score of the sea- 
g son for Carnegie, a superb 98-96- 
89 285. Bob finally settled down 
in the standing position and 
brought his score up to the place 
where he finished last season.
Scott McCormick fired his third
consecutive plus 280 score, a 98- 
94-89 281, But these two were not
good enough to pull up the other 
eight Tartan shooters who could 
Kgt not get above 271. The only other 
respectable score belonged to 
freshman Howard Graham who
shot a 271 in his first intercol­
legiate rifle match.
Clarion’s 1395 was their best 
showing of the season, and 28 
points higher than their last 
match. With West Virginia, Indi­
ana State, Allegheny, and W & J,

Grid Team Feels Frustration
by Ronald Bidula
The 1964 football season at Carnegie Tech will probably 
long be remembered by the players, the coaches, and all those 
connected with the team as one of complete and utter 
frustration. When drills began back in early September the
indications were that a success-^---------------------------------—------------—
ful season was in the offing.
A year ago Coach Joe Gaspar- 
ella could not put enough bodies 
into uniform to field complete 
first and second teams. This year, 
amazingly enough, he had nine­
teen freshmen along with several 
lettermen to work with. That was 
the outlook before the first game 
back in September.
In the next nine weeks Techs 
gridiron warriors managed to 
win only one game while they 
lost four and gave away four. 
Tech’s record could very easily 
have been a respectable 5-4 in­
stead of a disappointing 1-8.
CIT convincingly defeated a 
feeble team from Case Tech, but 
the Tartans were obviously com­
pletely out of their class against 
the likes of Westminster, Wooster, 
Rochester, and Grove City. CIT’s 
efforts against Allegheny, F&M, 
Denison, and W&J can probably 
best be described as the kinds ot
performances that give coaches 
gray hairs and tighten the pad­
locks on the moneybelts of 
wealthy alumni.
Tech’s own mistakes put these 
four games in the lost column. 
The lack of adequate practice 
time to teach and to polish the 
basic fundamentals of blocking 
and ball handling was fatal. No 
offensive style, much less Coach 
Gasparella’s wide-o pen pro 
type, can win unless based upon 
these foundations.
The season did have its bright 
spots, though. Tech’s passing at­
tack was highly effective in spots 
and provided exciting football to 
the spectators. Fullback Smokey 
Merrill performed outstandingly 
throughout the year and will be 
remembered for the power and 
speed he contributed to the Tar­
tans’ running attack. Unsung line- 
i man, Pete Mangarella, capably
anchored the CIT forward wall 
on both offense and defense. Jun­
ior Dave Gilchrist thrilled the fans 
early in the season with his break­
away running. It was also inter* 
esting to watch the day-to-da^ 
battle for the practice field be­
tween the band, the IM partici 
pants, and the football team.
j “Monday Morning Quarterbacks”
Perhaps the most sour and dis- 
j turbing note this season was the 
| high density of “Monday morning 
i quarterbacks” on the Carnegie 
! Tech campus. The solution to this 
! problem is obvious — bring scrod 
j back to Skibo during the football 
season and let these “pundits” un- 
; vent their cynicism upon some- 
j thing else. The football team does 
j its best e^.ch Saturday afternoon 
j —this is all that can be expected 
of them.
Next September will bring an­
other football season to Carnegie 
Tech. The large number of pros­
pective returnees to the football 
team for next year generates hope 
for better things in 1965. Let’s 
face it, the only direction the 
football fortunes of Carnegie Tech 
can go is up!

FORD MOTOR COMPANY’S EXPERIMENTAL GAS TURBINE SUPERHIGHWAY TRUCK 
ANTICIPATES THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY NETWORK OF THE 1970's.
A new era in trucking is almost here. When the 41,000-mile national highway network is completed it will bo 
possible for the first time to schedule coast to coast, big payload hauling. Ford Motor Company's answer to 
the challenge is this experimental tractor-trailer combination. A tandem axle drive tractor, powered by 
a 600 hp gas turbine engine permits a cruising speed of 70 miles per hour, a non-stop range of 600 miles. 
Designed for long-distance, non-stop operation, the two-man cab includes sleeping facilities, fold-away table, 
lavatory, toilet, oven, refrigerator and TV for the co-driver—with over 6'3" of headroom. Because of its 
cruising speed, the truck will be compatible with the normal passenger car flowrate of traffic.
Other unique features are its odorless exhaust and extremely quiet operation.
Anticipating the opportunities and needs of the future is standard practice at Ford Motor Company.
That’s why it’s such an exciting place to work. Look to Ford Motor Company for a career with growth potential 
•nd satisfaction—from pure science to manufacturing ... marketing to labc relations.

SPORTS
Tech Basketball Opener Near; 
Winning Season A Possibility
by Tom Terpack
The scholastic standards of Carnegie Tech occasionally 
pay off for CIT coach Mel Cratsley . . . when they attract 
someone like last year’s MVP Andy Niedra . . . but, more
often than not, these standards^ 
raise havoc with coach Cratsley’s 
plans. Rare is the season when 
players are not, as grades are re­
ducing: Tech’s first winning sea­
son since 1959-60, when stars 
Bill Soffa, Mike Flynn, and 
Andy Koraer were representing 
the Plaid.
Cratsley is pinning his main 
hopes on Hank Werronen, senior 
three-vear letterman who has 
been switched to the outside for 
the first time in his college career. 
Hank’s shooting is at its usual 
best, and he has developed into 
the leader so badly needed.
Jeff Kalin will have to provide 
the height and rebounding skill 
this year. Kalin, an exceptionally 
fine high-school player, has yet to 
live up to his potential, but if he 
does, some major schools are go­
ing to be in for a large-sized sur­
prise.
Sophomore Don Keefer had 
the ball away. However, a sched- j been counted on heavily, and he

ported, shuffled in and out of the 
line-up like men in a seven day 
bicycle race.
Despite a murderous schedule 
ahead, Cratsley believes he has 
reason for optimism. “It has been 
many a year since I’ve enjoyed 
coaching so much.” says Tech’s 
basketball mentor. In this state- 
metn perhaps lies the key to the 
fortunes of Tech’s team this year. 
Although the team is the least ex­
perienced and physically smallest 
to represent Tech in five years, 
they more than make up for it in 
desire and co-operative spirit, ac­
cording to the coaching staff.
The Tartans are being so well 
drilled this year that they will 
rarely beat themselves by giving
The loss of Steve Foels and 
Andy Niedra through graduation 
is certain to hurt the Tartans, 
as will the fact that Jim Kamm 
and Sam Cupps will not be 
available this year. Still, Crats­
ley feels that Tech has a nucleus 
that is entirely capable of pro-

Burdette. If Newell can regain the 
j touch that he had for the first 
i three games last year, shooting 
; 80%, Tech w'ill be in possession 
of a potent scorer.
Three lettermen who have been 
working out with the team for 
only a week are George McGeary,
Pittsburgh’s Oldest Fin4 Jewelers Since 1832
clxclusive at Robert A
Ray Metz, and Jules Borkowski, 
all seniors. McGeary and Metz 
both played football, and were un­
able to attend early practice, 
which will limit the amount of ac­
tion they will see in the opening 
games. It is certain, however, that 
their height will prove valuable 
to the Tartans as the season pro­
gresses. Borowski, an aggressive 
driver and two-hand shooter su­
preme, will also play an im­
portant part in CIT’s plans this 
year.
Tech’s best freshman prospect 
appears to be Dave Ciliberti at 
6 -3”, 206 pounds. Cratsley, how­
ever, feels that Ciliberti 'will be 
starting on the JV squad, and will 
be given the opportunity to work 
himself up to the varsity.
Tech will open the season on 
Tuesday, December 1, against 
Pitt’s Panthers at the Pitt Field- 
house. The first home game will 
be the following day, Tuesday. 
December 2, against W&J at Skibo 
Gym. Varsity will begin at 8:15, 
with the JV’s squaring off at 6:30.
SAE Favorite 
For Volleyball 
Championship
At the end of the first week of 
the I. M. Volleyball season, SAE 
has assumed the favorite role. 
SAE “A” has virtually clinched 
first place in the Pass League, 
while SAE “B” has an excellent 
chance of finishing on top in the 
Pass League.
ATO, TDP, BTP “A,” and the 
Grad Nads have also shown 
strength in their respective 
leagues, but it remains to be seen 
if any of the above teams will 
be able to match SAE’s well bal­
anced aggregation in the playoffs.
In the Set League SAE “B” 
took two of three games from 
the good guys, and then defeated 
BTP “A” in two straight sets. 
ATO dropped the final game 
against BTP “A” in an upset, but 
bounced back to whip the Dunk- 
ers in two games. In other league 
action, the Dunkers took SN “N,” 
as did the Good Guys.
GSIA surprisingly forfeited to 
TX, but then came back to de­
feat the Fern Docs. DTD took 
two straight games from the Fern 
Docs, but then dropped a very 
close match to the Grad Nads 
“G.” The Grade also took two 
straight from DU, which then 
bounced back to defeat TX to
complete the action in the Serve 
League. ,
In the Spike League, TDP de« 
cisioned ATO “B” and then 
dropped a surprising verdict to 
BSR. BSR also took PKA in 
two straight sets, but PKA 
bounced back to upend the Cel­
lar Dwellers. PKT dropped two 
straight games to the Cellar Dwel-ft, 
lers, but then defeated ATO “B.
In the Pass League, SAE “A* 
rolled over BTP “B” and SN “S** 
in championship form, while the 
Grad Nads “N” saved the league 
from turning into a runaway by 
whipping the Deadbeats and KS, 
The Deadbeats bounced back to 
take BTP “B,” while SN “S” won 
over KS in the other league en-
