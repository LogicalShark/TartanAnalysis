R. O. T. C. REVIEWED
The last ringing note of “La Mar­
seillaise" rang through the vast mu­
sic hall; on the center oC the stage a 
young American girl, dressed in the 
tri-colors of France, stood with arm 
erect, a thousand khaki-clad men 
rose to their feet in a thunder of ap­
plause. Monsieur Maurice George 
Casenave, financial minister plenipo­
tentiary of France, tears streaming 
from his eyes, rushed to the singer and 
bowed low over her hand and kissed 
it. Then the organ tones again pealed 
out, and, led by Miss Sophie Braslau, 
contralto of the Metropolitan Opera 
Company, the vast assemblage gath­
ered in honor of the great disciple of 
peace, sang in unison the mightiest 
of martial airs.
The war, with its ultimate victory 
for the troops of democracy, was the 
dominating figure throughout all the 
Founder’s Day exercises of the Carne­
gie Institute, held in Carnegie Music 
Hall yesterday afternoon.
The ceremony was replete with dra­
matic moments, most of them sponta­
neous. The greatest assemblage in 
the history of the exercises was pres­
ent, the leaders of Pittsburgh’s 
thought and industry, education and 
finance. On the platform, sitting be­
neath a magnificent draping of Allied 
colors, were the men sent here by the 
government for military pursuits, more 
than 100 army officers.
The galleries were crowded with 
uniformed students of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. Miss Bres­
lau, Metropolitan Opera Co., sang the 
“Star Spangled Banner,” and her 
¦wonderful voice, full toned and mag­
nificent, and replete with enthusiasm, 
thrilled her hearers into instant ac­
claim. Then she sang it again, her­
self leading in ensemble singing.
The Rev. Dr. Wyatt Brown, rector 
of the Episcopal Church of the Ascen­
sion, pronounced the invocation, and 
after a rendition of the overture to 
‘‘William Tell,” by.Charles Heinroth, 
Walter George Smith, president of 
the American Bar Association, spoke 
on "The Duty of the Hour.” A. K. 
Oliver, secretary of the board of trus­
tees, made his annual report, after 
which a portrait of Mrs. Andrew Car­
negie, painted by Miss Cecilia Beaux, 
was unveiled by Mrs. Robert A. 
Franks of New York, a close friend of 
Mrs. Carnegie.
Frederick G. Rodgers sang “Rule 
Britannia," while Colonel T. W. Grif­
fith of the United States Army, and 
Major Hilliard Lyle, of the Princess 
Pat Regiment, stood with, the flag of 
Great Britain.
Then Miss Breslau sang the French 
anthem that for years has been the 
world’s hymn of freedom and equality 
and the assemblage went wild with 
delight. Th^y sang it with her, in 
French and in English simultaneous­
ly. Sedate men on the platform 
grasped her hand. From the rear rose 
the famous “Rebel” yell of Dr. John 
A. Brashear. Then she sang “When 
the Boys Come Home.”
M. Casenave, his voice broken with 
emotion, made a short address and 
the exercises in the music hall closed

SENIORS MECHANICALS 
MAKE TEST ON ENGINE
Guests of Youngstown Sheet 
and Tube Company
TWELVE IN PARTY
The entire Senior Mechanical Class 
left Pittsburgh last Thursday morn­
ing for Youngstown, Ohio, to run a 
power test at the plant of the Youngs­
town Sheet & Tube Company, on their 
rod mill and its engine. Tlip party 
W’as under direction of Prof. W. 
Trinks and included William. Geist, 
laboratory assistant, Mr. J. D. Kellve, 
’14, preceded the party a day and made 
preliminary arrangements for the test. 
The undergraduate, members of the 
group were:
A. C. Baronner 
J. E. Carlson 
Oscar Chrisnnsen 
Jr T. Eaton
B. L. Keim 
E. F. Obert 
J. P. Paca 
A. V. Ritts 
G. W. Todd
This Youngstown Sheet and Tube 
Company very kindly paid all the ex­
penses of the entire trip and test. Dur­
ing the course of the test they also 
entertained the group at lunch at their 
general offices and furnished guides 
for a tour of inspection through the en­
tire plant. The Sheet and Tube is 
probably the largest independent steel 
company in the country and a trip 
through it of interest to anyone, was 
of especial interest to the mechanicals 
many of whom are following the steel 
works course under Professor Trinks.
TWO TECH TEAMS TO 
MAKE TRIPS THIS WEEK
Coach Eyman will take the track 
squad over to Granville, Ohio, Satur­
day, to meet the Denison University 
team in a dual meet. Denison has 
always maintained a high standard 
of athletics in Ohio college circles 
and this year's track team is herald­
ed to be no exception. Feight, a for­
mer Tech man, is starring for the 
Ohio team and is reported as running 
'the 100 yard dash in 10 flat. The 
team should give the .Plaid squad 
ample opposition.
Iiast Saturday some of the mem­
bers of the track squad competed in 
the Press meet at Schenley Oval. 
Lingenfelser took second place in 
the 220-yard dash and Ferguson third 
in the mile. The remainder of the 
squad did not do much, probably be­
cause of the fact that they had par­
ticipated in the Inter-School meet on 
the. previous day.
The baseball 'team .will probably 
meet a team from Camp Lee here 
Tuesday, April 30, and will journey 
into Ohio Saturday to meet the Hi­
ram College nine. Coach McCulloch 
is striving hard to round out a win­
ning combination. His work has 
been curtailed by the wet grounds, 
which also were accountable for the 
cancellation of the Kiski game last 
Saturday.
GIRLS OF RED CROSS AUXILIARY AT TECH DOING COMMENDABLE WORK
More Help Needed—Everyone Urged to Turn Out—Honor
Roll
There is a little room in an out-of- 
the-way corner of the Design School, 
and another little room in an out-of- 
the-way corner of the Margaret Morri­
son School; and both these rooms are 
connected with the battle front in Eu­
rope, for they are the rooms of the 
local Red Cross. Behind them hangs 
the great background of the war. And 
when the boys are drilling, one would 
find, if she sought out these rooms, a 
devoted’ group of girls doing gladly 
and well, hour after hour, the tasks of 
the Red Cross.
It is very able work, the work the 
girls have been accomplishing. Their 
success is revealed below in the lists 
of the articles they have made. The 
National Headquarters has awarded 
to both Design and Margaret Morri­
son Societies the Blue Star, signify­
ing excellence. The achievements of 
the insignia invites wide recognition, 
in particular that solid kind of recog­
nition which will lead other, women 
students to share the laborors of the 
girls already active, whose names are 
printed today on the Honor Rolls of 
the Red Cross.
It may be officially announced today 
likewise that the recent ball realized 
for the societies over .$700.
These workers need all the help
SCIENCE EASILY WINS 
BIG INTERSCHOOL MEET
The Interschool Meet held’ on Tech 
Field last Friday was featured by the 
uncovering of several dark horses and 
the rooting of a group of lusty lunged 
Maggie Murphs in the Mellon Hall 
Bleachers. The fact that Science 
walked away with the meet was hard­
ly a feature, because this is becom­
ing the natural course of events in 
the annual Tech intermural classic. 
Industries and Design have apparent­
ly lost more heavily than Science 
through the war and seemed at an 
even greater disadvantage than in the 
past.
After Lingenfelser and Petry had 
placed Industries in .the lead in the 
first event, the 100-yard dash; Science
they can got. Next autumn wo shall 
have a bigger Red Cross organization, 
in which both faculty and students 
will participate—an organization pre­
pared to meet the greater demands 
tliot will be made upon us. But as­
sistance is tremendously needed now, 
if the local societies are to complete 
by the end of the semester the work 
allotted it by headquarters.
The list of surgical dressings made 
and shipped up to the present time is
as follows:
Gauze wipes ............................................5900

Brilliant Decorations
MUSIC BY RIEH
On ^ho ovoning of Friday, April 
tho Senior Class of M. M. C. S. held 
its annual formal ball in the club 
room' of tho Union. Tho hall was at* 
tractlvoly decorated with flags of the 
allied nations, palms and Mowers. At 
tho entrance were standards holding 
huge bunches of white carnations and 
tied with filmy bows of red, white and 
blue tulle, while directly opposlle was 
hung an enormous American llag.
In tho receiving line were Miss 
Helen Bosworth, president of tho class, | 
Doan Brood and Miss Parry, honorary I 
members, together with tho heads of 
tho various departments of tho school. 
As a representative from tho junior 
class, Miss Helen Savard was prosont. 
Both faculty and «seniors wore well 
reproBented among the dancers.
The grand march was led by Miss 
Bosworth and Lloutenant Orr. After 
the march, dancing began and was con- 
tined until 12 o’clock when supper 
was served in tho foyer of the build­
ing. Small tables were used and 
places for four wore sot at each one. 
The light came from tall yellow can­
dles decorating the center of each 
table. The flickering light lent an air 
of dignity and mysticism to the occa-

FORMER TECH MEN VISIT 
TECH WHILE BN LEAVE
During the last week several famil­
iar faces have appeared on our campus 
—former school-mates of some of us, 
who are serving Uncle Sam in the 
“World War.”
G. Rudolph Brandin, Ex-A. S. ’19, a 
former student in Mechanical Engi­
neering visited old friends during a 
ten day’s furlough. Brandin was for­
merly Secretary of the Carnegie 
Branch of the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers and Sales Man­
ager of the Thistle. He was active 
in all lines while in school and en­
listed in the U. S. Naval Reserves late 
last fall. After serving two months 
on a coastwise ship and two months’ 
training in the Navigation Course at 
Pelham Bay, N. Y., he was commis­
sioned as Ensign In the U. S. Mer­
chant Marine. “Rudy,” as, he was 
popularly known, reports that lie has 
seen “Cupe” Young, another Tech 
man, quite frequently dining his stay 
at Pelham Bay. I-Ie left Monday for 
New York City to reporl for active 
service.
Another man visiting here at the 
present time and known to many, was 
11. M. Crosby, Ex-A. I)., '19, who Is 
also an Ensign. Crosby served In the 
U. S. Navy for three years before en­
tering Tech and has been across sev­
eral times since his second enlistment. 
While in school, he pursued the course 
in architecture.

PARTS WELL PLAYED
As all the world knows, Tuoaday, 
April 23, was tho anniversary of tho 
birth of Win, Shakespeare whoso won­
derful genius moulded into Imperisha­
ble form the \vju, 
the history of tho ages to bo an her­
itage of joy to ages yet unborn. Ono 
may apply to these works tho very 
words tho poet uses In his description 
of the Siren of tho Nile—“ago cannot 
wither (them) nor custom stale 
(their) infinite variety.”
Tho department of drama made Its 
Initial public performance on this date, 
1914, with “The Two Gentlemen of 
Verona," establishing at that time, a 
most appropriate and laudable custom, 
which It has suatainod oven through 
tho vicissitudes of a world's war, 
which has depleted Its onrollmont to 
an alarming degree.
As Its votive offering for this year It 
brought, to the shrltio of tho bard of 
Avon, his delightful comedy, "A Mid­
summer Night’s Droam," and a worthy 
offering It was from every point of 
view, as tho generous applause of a 
discriminating audience attested. For 
a first performance tho play moved 
with remarkable smoothness while tho 
waits between scenes wore most agree­
ably masked by ithe Mendelssohn 
music based on this play and perform­
ed by the orchestra of the Department 
of Music, under the baton of J. Vlolc 
O’Brien. The nocturne proved an es­
pecially enjoyable number, while tho 
familiar “Spring Song” and the “Wed­
ding March” caused ripples of ¿ellght 
to pass through the audience.
None of tho charactes in ¦ this play 
have any sustained action, but all 
kaleidoscope into an interesting whole 
with delightful results. Coleridge 
speaks of it as “one continued speci­
men of the dramatized lyrical”—while 
Verplanck says “it has also that high­
est perfection of the lyric art, the per­
vading unity of the poetic spirit—that 
continued glow of excited thought— 
which blends the whole rich and 
strange variety in one common effect 
of gay and dazzling brilliancy."
“Theseus, Duke of Athens," who 
“graciously lends himself to be 
amused,” was played by Mr. Alexander 
Buchanan, whose physique adapts him 
admirably to the role, but who fails 
to impress as the great man of action, 
that he was. There is much more In 
“Theseus,” than Mr. Buchanan has yet 
discovered, or at least, made manifest 
to his audience, “Hippolyta, Queen oC 
the Amazons,” betrothed to Theseus, 
had all the freshness and vigor of un- 
trameled nature in the hands of VIo- 
lante Bollinger. She succeeds In 
creating Interest in all of her charac­
terizations. Miss Anna Dice gave a 
less Amazonian “Hippolyta,” which 
suggested the distaff rather than the 
sword. She Is not well c'hsf In this 
role, which should suggest vigor above 
everything else. Mr. David Gaither's 
“Phllostrate, Master of the Revels,’* 
was an Interesting and amusing bit In 
its place. Mr. George Traborts’ 
“Egeus, Father to Hormia," was ono of 
the very good characteizatlons in tho 
production with which may be ranked 
(Continued on Pago Eight.)
A large part of the Battalion form­
ed Saturday at one thirty and march­
ed to Shadyside station to escort tho 
tank to the campus. The tank gave 
a exhibition of its power and destruc­
tive ability before an immense crowd 
in the afternoon. The tank strolled 
through barbed wire entanglements 
and over trenches. It climbed the side 
of the cut and smashed its way 
through an old Stoddard-Dayton auto­
mobile with very little trouble.
The tank, the Britannia, was import­
ed from France, and has seen active 
service in the Somme region. It is
run by a 240 H. P. motor and was con­
structed In England. The crew con­
sists of seven men, and the machine is 
armed with five machine guns, two be­
ing placed on each sldo and one in 
front.
Sixty thousand rounds of ammuni­
tion are carried In action and eight 
emergency rifles are handy.
AbouL twenty-five thousand people 
witnessed the demonstration on Sat­
urday.
On 'Sunday l.lie tank was used as a 
platform for tho speakers at the patri­
otic meeting.

THE HONOR ROLL
The Tart,an is,publishing in this issue a complete list, as far as 
is at the present time at all possible, of all Tech men—faculty mem­
bers, alumni or under-graduates, who are now in the service of our 
government. This Honor Roll has been compiled with great care, 
and will, we think, prove of value to everyone connected with Tech.
This roll, together with a. number of photographs taken around 
the campus, seem of sufficient value and importance to warrant otir 
publishing this week an eight-page issue of the paper, which was 
necessary in order to include the material.
The Hagpipe deserves credit for having printed in their last is­
sue a complete roll of Industries men in service. Being the organ of 
the entire school, we think it fitting that we should publish the 
complete list.
A WORD OF PRAISE
During the last week members of the Tech R. O. T. C. have been 
doing their share to assist in the Liberty Loan Campaign which has 
been conducted so close to the campus. On Friday morning Com­
pany B, of Design School, assembled at Schenley Oval and acted as 
guards on the field when he aeroplane which flow here from Dayton 
arrived. A number of tho men remained on the grounds and con­
trolled I lie crowds which assembled during the time the machine 
was there.
Members of the O. T. O. class on Saturday formed a guard for 
the tank “Britannia” and escorted it from Shad.vsidc Station to Tech. 
and assistod in the exhibition there. On Sunday they were again 
busy when the crowds swarmed Flagstaff Ilill in an effort to at least 
obtain a gljpipse of the strange war machine.
This may all seem irrelevant, but if is cited merely to show that 
Ihe men are doing their part and showing the right spirit in their 
efforts to help in any way they can. When men come out of their 
own free will and perform the rather thankless task of helping to 
control crowds such as have assembled on and near our campus dur­
ing the last; week-end, their- action shows commendable interest in 
tho work in hand.
AN ANNOUNCEMENT -

Tartan, has been confined to his home on account of illness for the 
past two weeks, the work of both tin1 editorial and make-up end of

for next year has not yet been appointed, but will be announced 
soon. In the meantime the entire staff is doing its best to fill the 
vacancy left by his enforced absence, and is just beginning to realize 
what a large gap it really is.
It is hoped that, in view of this fact, allowance will be made 
for the mistakes we are sure .to make; or that at least, responsibility 
for them will be properly placed.

WAR DEPARTMENT 
Office of the Chief of Coast Artillery 
Washington 
April 24, 1918.
The President,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, ¦
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Sir:
In addition to the duties with which it is ordinarily charged, the 
Coast Artillery Corps is serving in France all of our railroad artillery 
and anti-aircraft batteries, and most of the motor-drawn guns of 
large caliber (six-inch and larger). So large a proportion of its 
strength is already abroad, and so much more will be required within 
the next few months, that many additional officers will be needed. 
It is hoped that you may be willing and able to bring this to the at­
tention of a number of men of the type desired.
Only graduates of the training camp at Fort Munroe, Virginia, 
are appointed officers. A three months’ course is given, starting early 
in January, April, July and October. It is expected to continue this 
throughout the war. Candidates are selected from among enlisted 
men of the coast artillery, by boards of officers convened in all com­
mands. To become eligible, therefore, it is necessary to enter the 
service as an enlisted man. One not registered for draft may enlist at 
any recruiting station; A registered man should write to the Chief 
of Coast Artillery, Washington, D. C., stating his qualifications. 
Authority for his induction into service .will then be. asked for; and, 
if this be granted, a letter will be-furnished to the applicant, directing 
his local board to place him in service and send him to a coast artil­
lery post.
It should be clearly understood that no promise can be made 
to any applicant that he will be selected for the training camp if 
enlisted, or that he will be graduated if sent to the camp. This de­
pends entirely upon the man himself. If unsuccessful, he will con­
tinue to serve as an enlisted man. If successful, he will be appointed 
second lieutenant and assigned to duty as such immediately upon 
completion of the training camp course. As the demand for officers 
is continual, it is unlikely that any man of suitable education and 
character will fail to secure promotion, though, as already stated, no 
promise can be made.
Engineering graduates are especially desired, but a technical 
education is not essential for all officers. A man who has completed 
a year or more of college work, including courses in plane trigonom­
etry and the use of logarithms, has an excellent chance of winning 
appointment if he enters the service before the first of July.
Thanking you for. any assistance you may be able to give, I 
remain,
Yours very truly,
(Signed) THOMAS M. SPAULDING,
Major, Coast Artillery Corps, 
Assistant to Chief of Const Artillery.

substituted and more vegetables are 
eaten. Twenty-five girls are already 
doing this and the list still hangs in

dinner in the University Club given 
by the Board of Trustees.
Secretary Oliver, in his report, told 
of the progress of the year. His pa­
per took up the progress of the vari­
ous departments, including the Libra­
ry, Fine Arts Department, the Muse­
um, Technical Schools, Music Hall and 
Libracy School.
The library, Mr. Oliver said, in com­
mon with the rest of the activities of 
the institute, was aiding in war work, 
and had been an active factor in many 
patriotic campaigns, including the 
work for the Food Administration, 
War Savings Societie^, Liberty Loan, 
Red Cross and the Americanization of 
foreigners.
The museum, he said, had aided 
many rare specimens of animal and 
floral life through its own expeditions 
and the gifts of friends. The schools, 
he declared, were largely war activ­
ities, and in addition to having been 
made an officers’ training school, 
were teaching about 850 soldiers war 
studies, and had an honor roll of 
795 men with the colors, five of whom 
had been killed.
The new pipe organ in the music 
hall, he said, in many respects was 
the greatest in existence. Its value 
is $46,000, and it has 100 registers 
representing different tonal shades 
produced by 7,669 pipes, not counting 
bells, chimes and a concert grand 
piano.. The library school,. he added, 
Was unable to supply enough gradu­
ates by 500 per cent.
“The people of Pittsburgh i may 
justly be proud of the fact that their 
Carnegie Institute devoted as it has 
been, and in future years will be, 
primarily to the pursuits of peace, 
hjis seized the opportunity open to it 
by it’s wonderful resources and organ­
ization to step into the first ranks of 
those who have been quick to realize 
that our country is engaged in a bitter 
war and are determined to win it,” he 
said.
M. Cassenave told of Germany’s de­
sire to obtain the iron mines of 
France, and said that German hypo­
critical diplomacy had always covered 
German greediness, and concluded by 
saying:
“That is the kind of menace that 
France has been subjected to for 40 
long years. And the world did not un- 
dorstand; it considered France trou­
blesome, because she knew how things 
were, but France never complained of 
the lack of .understanding of the world. 
Now everyone can see that the present 
war was inevitable—everyone can see 
why, unless things change by our vic­
tory, new Avars will incessantly stain 
the world with blood, incendarism and 
piracy.
“And with the help of America, who 
understands; of England, who under­
stands; of our other allies, who under­
stand. democracy will triumph, in spit»1 
of German propaganda, in spite »of 
German efficiency, in spite of German 
militarism. Then the hopes of Andrew 
Carnegie will be fulfilled, because, as 
your President has said. ‘Justice and 
peace shall reign in the affairs of 
men.’ ”
Mr. Smith told of the breaking down 
of international,,laws by Germany and 
discussed our own institutions, which 
he said differed from those of any 
other nation because of the preserva­
tion of local power to the state and 
national power to the General Govern­
ment, under written constitutions in­
terpreted by the courts. He said in 
part:
“Let us think long before we make 
any radical change in our fundamental 
law. It is not for ourselves alone that 
we must preserve this last finest ex­
periment in human government. The 
hopes of the masses of mankind are 
fixed upon our success. Should we 
wreather the storm which now beats 
upon us from without and overcome 
the more dangerous because insidious 
enemies from within ‘as by law of 
fate,’ the democratic principle with its 
ennobling ideal of equality of oppor­
tunity under the law will be adopted 
by civilized men wherever the aver­
age of intelligence fits them for the re­
sponsibility of self-government. Should 
we fail, the long struggle marked 
through centuries by advance and 
retrogression must be begun again.”
The trustees of the Carnegie Insti­
tute held the Founder’s Day dinner in 
the University Club last night. The 
guests included:
Taylor Alderdice, Dr. John A. Bra- 
shear, Mrs. McDowell, Mr. and Mrs.

THIEF CAUGHT AFTER 
MOST EXCITING CHASE
: Saturday morning • during.; baseball1 
•practice several men noticed a team 
of horses drawn up near the gas;, 
well. Upon investigation, it was 
foiind 'that several colored' men were 
busy hauling away wdgOn loads of: 
material : belonging to thé : well dril- 
ing apppaatus. 1 As • thé ‘studënts ap-, 
proached, -the ' teamser drove his 
team up the hill and got safely away. 
One of the nearer men s'tood' his 
ground and argued. Soon, however, 
seeing that his explanations were -fù- 
tile, he “lit out” for foreign parts. •
Àn exciting chase ensued. The 
thieî led tlie chase down Morewood 
avenue to Fifth and doubled back to 
Forbes. He ran along the Baltimore 
and Ohio tracks, finally overtaking an 
engine. The pursuers signaled the 
train, and again thé' chase was on, 
this time through the tunnel. The 
students posted one man at the 'en: 
trance of. the tunnel and rode 
through to the other end on the lo­
comotive.. Here they borôwed a re­
volver from a watchman and retrac­
ed their way into' tlie tunnel.
They found their dusky friend cud- 
elled up along the. tracks and stopped 
ii.is short run. by an unerring shot at 
the roof of the tunnel. He was tak­
en to the Oakland jail in the “pie 
wagon” with an honorary guard of 
students.
Coaches McCullough and Eyman 
who witnessed the start of the race, 
report that that the leading man did 
not even stop when Bert Munhall 
told him to.

The following interesting program 
was presented in the theater of School 
of Applied Design on Sunday evening, 
April 28, by students of the Depart­
ment of music—J. Vick. O’Brien, di- 
i rector. The opening number, Men- 
. delssohn’s “Prelude and Fuge in G” 
for organ, was most artistically played 
( by Miss Sophie Adele Thurston, whose 
I work showed an intelligent under­
standing of the resources of her instru- 
' ment. Mozart’s “Clarinet Quintet”— 
1 First Movement—proved an interesting 
J novelty and called forth hearty ap- 
) plause. The performers were Jean 
Wesseuer, Dorthy Manor, # Francis 
Kleyle, Raffaele Amato and Vladimir 
Belehrad.
. Wieniawski’s “Legend,” played by 
Francis Kleyle, was most cordially re­
ceived. .
Miss Margaret Allison played the
Second and-Third Movement's of “Con­
certo No. 1”—McDowell—with style^ 
and feeling. It. is always a pleasure 
¦io find a McDowell number on a pro­
gram. ••
• Miss?-Frederica Napier,made her in­
itial bow as a “ ’cellist”—playing Van 
Goen’s “Schezo”—which elicited much 
applause and several recalls.
The closing number, McDowell’S 
“Concerto No. 2,” Third Movement— 
played by Miss Ethel Shuman—proved 
very interesting; She has a full tone 
and facile- technique:
.All things.considered, it was one of 
the most interesting and most artistic 
program's of the season, reflecting 
credit on instructors and students 
alike.

Mr. Science—Well, er-ah, well, yes

a pre-established reputation!)
SPECTACULAR FLIGHTS 
BY DAYTON AIRPLANE
Early Thursday morning Company 
E, design school, were ordered out 
and marched to Schenley Oval to act 
as honorary guard of the airplane 
which had flown from Dayton, Ohio. 
The men were kept on guard until 
afternoon when they were relieved 
by regulars.
The airplane was a Curtis Tractor 
Bi-Plane, and was flown by Kenneth 
Moore of Detroit. He made the-trip 
from Dayton in five and a quarter 
hours, stopping at Coshocton for gaso­
line and minor repairs. He flew at an 
altitude of about three thousand feet.
Moore gave several demonstration 
flights while here, including loops, 
spirals, tail spins and dives. He ex­
ecuted one especially graceful landing, 
skiming ovtir the crowd and running 
the length of the oval .stopping direct­
ly in front of the judge’s stand.
Moore distributed Liberty Loan lit­
erature and returned to Dayton on 
Sunday.
FIFTY CRATES OF GUNS ARRIVE; CLASSES START
Fifty crates of army rifles have 
been received by the military commit­
tee. Instruction in musketry, includ­
ing sighting and firing from various 
positions, will begin\at once; and as 
soon as the bayonets arrive, bayonet 
practice will start. The trenches; and 
dummies for bayonet work are being 
prepared in , the hollow between Mar­
garet Morrison and -the fill.
MEN IN SERVICE GET WAR NUMBER OF BAGPIPE
The War number of the Bagpipe was 
a success in all its features. The, first 
of this week a copy of the magazine 
was mailed to each of the men whose 
name appeared on the honor roll.
There :are still a few copies of the 
issue and a limited number of the in­
serts, a picture of Co. D, which ,’imay 
be obtained from the members o£ the 
committee.

The Tech Architectural Club held 
its aniiual Invifa'iaSn last Tuesday 
evening in the Design* Schotpl after 
which about thirty members and fac­
ulty of the Architectuni,l Department,, 
journeyed to the Craft Avenue Club 
where they enjoyed a supper which 
was spread in liono of the event.
After the feed of roust turkey and ( 
other good things a -short address was 
given by each. Professors Leonard. 
Dornberger and “Sternfeld, who repre­
sented the faculty.
To say that the evening was lively 
would be putting it mildly. All of the 
characteristic atmosphere of the 
draughting room and the unlimited 
supply of “architects’ pep” were trans­
ferred undiminished to the scene of 
the banquet.
No formal entertainment was plan­
ned, however, this did not deter the 
architects from designing an im­
promptu "shindig” which was all the 
more enjoyable because of its origin­
ality. The entire structure of this 
phase of the evening’s diversion was 
built around the ‘‘Architects’ Jazz 
Band.” in which most musical instru­
ments are represented. A military 
review a la burlesque was one of the 
events which will not be easily forgot­
ten by any of those who participated.
The program was concluded with a 
few old time "cabaret.te" songs, with­
out which the evening would surely 
not have been complete.
The following men were added to 
the. roll of the Tech Architectural 
Club:
Goodwin
Kutchikian
Benham
Rank
Sabine
Stotz
Truxell
Silling

Ha ve You Seen the New Gillettes 
Specially Designed for the 
Fighting Man?
rPHESE models were designed by
members of the Gillette Organiza­
tion who have seen servi-ce with the 
Colors and know what the soldier is 
up against.
Hundreds of officers and men are 
buying them—the U. S. Service Set in 
metal case, and the new Khaki-covered 
sets for Uncle Sam’s soldiers ami 
officers.
The Gillette is the one razor for the 
man who is doing things—the one 
razor with world-wide use and repu­tation.
When a man wants new Blades he 
can get them at any Post Exchange 
or Y. M. C. A. Hut—here in America 
or Overseas.
Our Paris Office carries stocks—is 
constantly supplying the American 
Expeditionary Forces. Gillette Safety 
Razors and Blades on sale everywhere 
in France, England, Italy and the 
Eastern battle fronts.

mile and second in the two-mile; in 
both events competing against a field 
of men who have been training all 
Spring. He has excellent wind and 
grit, cutting in for his place on both 
occasions on the home stretch. E. V. 
King of Science pulled down first 
place In the high hurdles and third in 
the low hurdles. H. Beck, a Science 
Plebe, came through with first place 
in the broad jump, leaping 19 feet 4 
inches. “Cooky'” Woodward cleared 
10 feet G for first place in the Pole 
Vault. Although he has been on the 
track squad for several seasons, this 
is his best record by some inches.

(ContiFxoni Pa^e One.) j
Hubbard Kirkpatrick’s “Lysander” j 
and Hugo Taustine’s “Demetrius.’' : 
Taustine’s salient characteristic is 
earnestness of purpose by which he 
convinces; Kirkpatrick’s is poetical 
interpretation by which he persuades. 
His voice has a mellowness and a 
persuasive quality which greatly en­
hances his reading of romantic roles. 
Miss Helen Donnelly’s “Helena” was 
done in the truly Shakespearian vein, 
light and thoughtless save for the 
dominating idea. “All fancy sick, she 
is, and pale of cheers, with sighs of 
love.” Miss Beatrice Hienrich’s 
“Helena” had a stronger note of feel­
ing: both displayed the artistic sense 
which prevents over-acting. Miss 
Hazel Beck's “Hermia,” “though she be 
but little*,.she is fierce”—was a most 
¦ charming vixen with the quarrel 
scene. She has a penchant for com­
edy, which Miss Dorothy Reubenstein, 
Who is alco cast for this role, does not 
possess. Miss Reubenstein may al­
ways be depended upon to read her 
lines well, but this role calls for much 
more.
Mr. .Tames Church as “Oberon, 
King of the Faries,” brought out all 
the poetic beauty of his lines. Cun­
ningham says “The dialogue between 
Oberan and Titania is, of itself one of 
the most delightfully poetic scenes 
that literature affords,” and it may 
be said the entire fairy cast caught 
and held the “poetic idea.” Miss Mary 
Riccard’s “Titania" was a more human 
“Fairy Queen" than that of Miss 
Minotte Buddeke, which was truly a 
thing oC gossamer. She has the love­
liest ©f voices and a lightness and 
daintiness of motion which adapts her 
especially for this role. Miss Ellen 
Crowe’s “Pease Blossom” was an ex­
cellent piece of work having spontan- 
iety and charm. Carolyn Mering as 
“Cobweb,” Ruth Farmer as “Moth” 
and Dorothy High as “Mustardseed,” 
completed- the fairy tribe. Katherine 
Jones Engle did “that merry .wandeer 
of iblie night*’Puck ilia very satisfac­
tory manner, though making it less in­
dividual than is usual with this very 
important personage in the play. But 
after all what would this play be 
without “Bottom” (the only effort on 
the poets’ part at the delineation of 
"character” in this play), and who 
could so well divine that character 
as Win. Mulligan, to whom it was en­
trusted and who is droll to a degree 
in all the varied phases of Bottom’s 
career. His “me thought I was. Me 
thought 1 had” etc., called for rounds 
of laughter, in short, he came peril­
ously near being the whole show, so 
far as fun was concerned.
William Vieliman’s "Quince” was a 
«•lose second for popular approval, be­
ing exceedingly well done, while J. M. 
Wolcott made a very amusing and 
lady-like "Tliisbe” dying on the body 
of Pyramus in true high tragedy style. 
Theodore Viehman as “Snout, the 
Tinker," made a most “lovely wall” 
“Snug, the, Joiner.” Mr. M. McAteer, 
who is "slow of study,” made a most 
proper lion that did not affright the 
ladies, only made them smile. Law­
rence Paquin as “Starveling, a Tailor,” 
shone as the “moon” and guided his 
unhappy “dogs’* with true general­
ship.
The play was lovely and delightly- 
fully funny. The stage setting for 
the forest scene (by J. Woodman 
Thompson), was especially beautiful 
and the lighting effect good.

SOMETHING did it. What?
Goodness—that’s all. Unchang­

ible, Goodness.
For further particulars—
Regulation in uniforms demands a 
rigid simplicity. Yet some uniforms 
look so much better than others.
It’s the quality of the fabric, the 
smartness of the fit, that makes the 
difference. It is very important for 
an officer to look his best—therefore 
you want the best uniforms to be 
had. We have them.

sion. Supper was served by members 
of the sophomore class. The seniors 
hope to have this custom become a 
school tradition. The girls were at­
tractively dressed in white with ribbon 
ties of red, white and blue. Joyce was 
engaged as ca!terer. The supper con­
sisted of fruit salad, sandwiches, 
cakes, coffee and salted nuts.
Dancing was resumed and continued 
until 2 o'clock. The music, which was 
furnished by Riehl’s Orchestra, was 
well selected and was enjoyed 
throughout the evening. It consisted 
of a banjo, saxophone, drums and 
piano. As the last strains of the home 
waltz were played, each senior had a 
feeling of regret that her last big col­
lege dance had come to an end and 
the Sonior Ball went down in the an­
nals of tlife class of 1918 as the great­
est of its many successful events. The 
success of the dance was due largely 
to the efforts of the committee in 
charge, the members of which were 
Miss Lorine Friedman, chairman; Miss 
Helen Senn, Miss Florence Greer, 
Miss Helen Clark and Miss Callle 
Hunger, and also to the interested co­
operation of the members of the 
class.
