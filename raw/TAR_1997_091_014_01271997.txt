Student death inspires gang violence awareness
3ublic Service announcement pays tribute to former student
By MAUREEN McGRANAGHAN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
“We are confronted daily with pov­
erty, drugs, gang violence, single-parent 
families, welfare, and police brutality— 
but we must not focus on the quicksand, 
but on the way out.” Javon Thompson, a 
of Pittsburgh’s Peabody High 
School, wrote these words on the thresh­
old of his college career at Carnegie 
Mellon in a1994Pitts­
burgh Post Gazette 
article. A few months 
later, he was shot dur­
ing an attempted rob­
bery, a victim of the 
gang violence he had

combating through 
both his art and his example. But stu­
dents at Peabody High School have not 
forgotten his example, as is evident in 
the new public service announcement 
they recently completed in conjunction 
with Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
Entitled “Coming Soon ... the Rest of 
Your Life,” the 30-second announcement 
shows a group of teenagers in a movie 
theater reacting to the different “Com­
ing Attractions.” A doctor delivering a

their guns, receive only boos and hisses.
project, it reflects Thompson’s message. 
Butler said, “This is something Javon 
would have liked, something he pushed 
for in his art work. If he was here today, 
he would have had a great deal to do 
with this, and he has a great deal to do 
with why we did this.”
The video, inspired by work Thomp­
son had started before his death, pre­

that included Thompson’s mother,

Lawson, and their daughter Taj ay a 
Javonna Thompson, born just a few 
weeks after her father’s death. “To me, 
it’s very special,” said Young. “This is 
work he started at CMU. He wanted to 
create a video with positive images, and 
his message to [his fellow students] was 
that they didn’t have to do drugs; they 
didn’t have to join gangs.”
The idea for the project originated in a 
series of electronic images Thompson 
had created as part of an electronic me­
dia class at CMU. These images, which
hope to the urban youth of his 
neighborhood and others like it. 
But his work also attracted at­
tention from an artistic stand­
point; Pier Marton, a professor 
at both CMU and Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers, discovered the im­
ages after Javon’s death and 
used them for demonstrations 
in a course he was teaching at 
Filmmakers on non-linear edit­
ing. In this way, he 
brought the idea to 
the attention of Di­
rector Hugues

By SHEILA FLANAGAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Student Life Office spon­
sored a trip to the Presidential 
Inauguration in Washington, 
D.C. last Saturday through Mon­
day for 48 CMU students. This 
visit to D.C. provided not only a 
chance for students to tour vari­
ous historical sights but also the 
opportunity to witness the Inau­
guration of President Bill Clinton.
The highlights of this trip for 
several students and staff were 
the American Gala and the Inau- 
'guration. The American Gala was
dress rehearsal that was held
on Saturday night for the Inau­
gural Gala, held on Sunday night 
to honor the President. Sonia 
Chandra, a senior chemical engi­
neering major, was among those 
who attended the Gala. “I went to 
the American Gala with a Mend 
of mine who got picked in the 
lottery for tickets to it. We saw 
celebrities such as Candice 
Bergen, Kenny Rogers, Jimmy 
Smits, Stevie Wonder, and the 
Dave Matthews Band,” said 
Chandra. The Gala provided an 
alternative to the Inaugural Balls 
which were held on Monday night. 
According to Kevin Hughes, Co­
ordinator of Student Life for Lead­
, Courtesy of Jillian Watkins
Civ,U students joined the University of Pittsburgh’s College Democrats last week 
to visit the nation’s capital. Several CMU students attended the Inaguration.
ership and Personal Develop­
ment, the Student Life staff 
elected not to attend any balls. 
“The cost for tickets was pretty 
exorbitant and many students 
had already missed a day of 
classes on Monday,” said Hughes. 
Those students that were willing 
to pay the high prices for tickets 
and willing to missa day of school 
went to the Innaguration through 
the University of Pittsburgh’s 
College Democrats club. Jillian 
Watkins, Keri Mills, and Arti 
Sharma were three such students 
that drove to D.C. with Pitt. These 
students were interested in stay­
ing in D.C. until the Youth Ball 
last Monday night. 
They had the opportu­
nity to meet celebrities 
such as Michael Dou­
glas and to see a per­
formance by L.L. Cool 
J.
Despite the bitter cold 
weather on Inaugura­
tion Day, the swearing- 
in and the parade were 
the most fascinating 
events of the whole 
weekend according to 
several students. “I 
would go back to the 
Inauguration in a 
minute... the highlight 
was seeing the Presi­
dent of the United 
States taking his oath 
of office and listening 
to his speech,” said 
Cindi Dennis, a fresh­
man in MCS who trav­
eled to D.C. with the 
Student Life group.
The students and 
staff stood in line to get 
to their places for sev­
eral hours before the 
actual swearing-in. 
Some people, like Den­
nis, were able to get 
close enough to get a 
decent view of the 
President. “Once I got 
to my area, I managed 
to get right up in the
front, next to the fence ... since I 
was on the left side, right behind 
where the seats were, I could see 
well,” Dennis said. Dennis also 
caught the beginning of the pa­
rade and managed to get a good 
view of Hillary Clinton and Tip­
per Gore before she had to return 
to the bus to go back to CMU. “It 
was challenging at times, but we 
had a good time ... and it only 
happens once every four years,” 
said Hughes.
“We’ve never done this before 
and so far we’ve gotten very posi­
tive evaluations from the stu­
dents,” said Smith. Andrew Chiu, 
a freshman in CIT, also agreed 
that the experience was valuable. 
“The Inauguration was definitely 
one of those things that just 
should be done during one’s life­
time. I can’t explain it. It was 
watching history as it happened. 
The Inauguration was worth 
standing there in the cold for four 
hours,” said Chiu.
Before winter break, the Stu­
dent Life Office posted fliers in­
viting students to participate in 
this event and providing details 
such as expected costs and activi­
ties that would be available for 
students in D.C.The cost of the 
trip which included accommoda­
tions for Saturday and Sunday 
nights as well as bus or van trans­
portation to and from D.C. was 
$75.
While this cost did not cover 
food, souvenirs, and transporta­
tion in D.C. according to the 
poster, it was reasonable enough 
for students to afford. “I’ve never 
been to the Inauguration ... I 
thought this would be a cool trip 
to go on because it was much 
cheaper than if I went myself,” 
said Chandra.
While in D.C., students and Stu­
dent Life staff also toured sights 
such as The National Gallery of 
Art, and the Washington Monu­
ment. Students also had a packet 
of activities and restaurants 
along with a Metro pass which 
were provided by Student Life .
Students just say “no”...
Officials, SDC plan wellness housing
By TREVOR MEYEROWITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
University Housing, Student 
Life and Student Health offi­
cials met with SDC members 
and other interested students 
to discuss a proposal for estab­
lishing wellness housing last 
Wednesday.
Henderson Hall is the pro­
posed site for the program 
which intends to promote
machine, and dumbbells. Also 
included would be a kitchen 
for demonstrations and stu­
dent use, and a health resource 
library.

“The proposal is still in revi­
sion based on feedback we con­
tinue to gather,” said Tim 
Michael, director of University 
Housing.
“The proposal is that a 
wellness housing focus would 
be established for 20 resi­
dents. Residents would agree 
to live in a substance-free en­
vironment,” said Anita 
Barkin, Director of Student 
Health Services.
According to the pro­
posal,“Wellness housing also 
provides a safe(r) living area 
for students who may be sus­

pressures and promotes debili­

“Funding will probably come 
from a number of different 
sources,” said Barkin.
SDC will not be a source of 
funding. SDC was brought in 
on the proposal to provide criti­
cism. After the proposal is fi­
nalized SDC will discuss it with 
administrators. “If SDC comes 
back and says resident stu­
dents support the proposal, I 
would hope the administration 
carries through as planned,” 
said SDC President Brian 
Bluth, a junior biology major.
Further meetings will be held 
where officials will discuss the 
proposal with SDC officials and 
current Henderson residents. 
The proposal will be presented

House fines Gingrich 
for ethics violation
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 
(Reuter) — The House of Rep­
resentatives voted Tuesday to 
reprimand Speaker Newt 
Gingrich and make him pay a 
$300,000 penalty for admitted 
violations of ethics standards.
The vote was 395 to 28. It 
made Gingrich, 53, a Georgia 
Republican, the first House 
speaker in U.S. history to be 
punished for misconduct by for­
mal vote of his colleagues.
“The penalty is tough and 
unprecedented,”Rep.Nancy 
Johnson, chairwoman of the 
ethics committee that recom­
mended the penalties, said in 
debate. “It is also appropriate. 
No one is above the rules of the 
House of Representatives.”
Gingrich admitted last De­
cember that he failed to get 
proper legal advice on the use 
of tax-exempt funds to finance 
a lecture course critics called 
partisan politics, and to misin­
forming House investigators on 
the facts of that case.
The vote climaxed after two 
years of bitter political strife 
focused on the speaker and 
members of the ethics commit­
tee.

GREENSBORO, N.C., Jan. 
22 (Reuter)—A federal jury on 
Wednesday ordered ABC tele­
vision to pay Food Lion Inc. 
$5.5 million in punitive dam­
ages as a result of the network’s 
undercover investigation of the 
supermarket chain.
The jury deliberated more 
than 30 hours over six days 
before reaching the decision, 
which also ordered two high- 
ranking producers for the ABC 
program to pay damages total­
ling $45,750.
ABC, now a unit of Walt 
Disney Co., said it would ap­
peal the jury award.
The jury’s decision was a 
victory for Food Lion, which 
never challenged the accuracy 
of ABC’s 1992 report of un­
sanitary food handling by Food 
Lion workers.
The supermarket chain 
based in Salisbury, N.C., said 
ABC defrauded the company 
by having two journalists fal­
sify job applications to get hired 
by Food Lion as a meat handler 
and delicatessen clerk. Once 
hired, the two journalists wore 
hidden cameras inside their 
clothing to videotape how Food 
Lion workers repackaged 
spoiled meat to sell to consum­
ers.
Food Lion stock and 
companywide store sales 
plunged after the November 5, 
1992 broadcast.
The punitive damages came 
in addition to the jury’s finding 
last month that ABC should 
pay $1,400 in actual damages 
for fraud and trespassing.
The trial was closely watched 
by media organizations be­
cause Food Lion, a unit of Bel­
gian retailer Ets Delhaize 
Freres et Cie “LE LION”, chose 
to attack the way the story was 
obtained rather than file a libel 
lawsuit.
“The verdict of the North 
Carolina jury should trouble 
every American, especially ev­
ery journalist,” ABC News 
President Roone Arledge said 
in a statement.
“After finding that the use of 
those undercover techniques 
caused Food Lion only token 
damages, the jury has now 
awarded Food Lion punitive 
damages of 4,000 times that 
amount. That result is uncon­
scionable,” Arledge said.
Lawyers for Food Lion ar­
gued the undercover journal­
ists were employed by Food 
Lion and duty-bound to clean 
dirty meat-cutting equipment 
and prevent the sale of the 
spoiled items they filmed.
The deliberations, lasting 30 
hours over six days, were some­
times contentious. Three times, 
the panel sent a note to U.S. 
District Judge Carlton Tilley 
saying they were deadlocked.
The jurors also decided to 
order “PrimeTime Live” Ex­
ecutive Producer Richard 
Kaplan to pay $35,000, and 
Senior Producer Ira Rosen to 
pay $10,750. Food Lion law­
yers suggested during closing 
arguments that Kaplan and 
Rosen be assessed $50,000 each 
in punitive damages.
The jury did not assess dam­
ages against ABC journalists 
Lynne Dale and Susan Barnett, 
who worked undercover at Food 
Lion stores.

Bomb goes off near clinic
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 
(Reuter) ¦— An explosion near a 
Planned Parenthood clinic rocked 
downtown Washington Wednes­
day on the anniversary of the Roe 
vs. Wade decision legalizing abor­
tion, a police spokesman said.
The blast occurred at about 7:30 
am EST at the clinic about five 
blocks from the White House. 
Witnesses said they saw a man 
running from the scene, about 
five blocks from the White House, 
after the device appeared to ex­
plode in his hand. There were no 
immediate reports of injuries.
The explosion followed a double 
bombing at an abortion clinic 
last week in an Atlanta suburb 
that injured six people. It coin­
cided with a number of demon­
strations and events in Washing­
ton to commemorate the 24th 
anniversary of the Supreme 
Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision.
Washington Police Chief Larry 
Soulsby told reporters it was too 
early to say whether the explo­
sion was linked to the clinic. It 
remained open after the blast, 
which occurred about 100 yards 
away on the opposite side of the 
street.
DOJ appeals 
Internet ruling
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UPI) 
— The Justice Department on 
Tuesday told the Supreme Court 
it will argue that a federal law 
restricting “indecent” communi­
cations bn the Internet does not 
violate the First Amendment be­
cause “parents and their children” 
have a right to use the Internet, 
too.
Last year, three-judge federal 
panels in Philadelphia and New 
York separately declared parts of 
the Communications Decency Act 
unconstitutional, saying they vio­
lated the free speech of Internet 
users who may want to send 
sexual material to other adults.
But the Supreme Court will hear 
argument in the appeal of the 
case on March 19.
The Justice Department filed 
its “merit” brief—in effect, a look 
at the arguments it will use be­
fore the justices—on the last day 
possible under a Supreme Court 
deadline.
The brief says, “Much of the 
Internet’s potential as an educa­
tional and informational resource 
will be wasted, however, if people 
are unwilling to avail themselves 
of its benefits because they do not 
want their children harmed by 
exposure to patently offensive 
sexually explicit material.”
The brief also cited Supreme 
Court precedents that have al­
lowed federal, state, and local 
governments to restrict sexual 
material in print and broadcast­
ing.
Judge decides 
ban is illegal
NEW YORK, Jan. 22 (Reuter) 
— In a victory for Penthouse 
magazine, a federal judge ruled 
Wednesday that a new law ban­
ning the sale of sexually explicit 
material at military stores vio­
lates the First Amendment.
U.S. District Judge Shira 
Scheindlin ordered that the De­
partment of Defense be perma­
nently restrained from changing 
the stock or policies in the gov­
ernment-operated stores.
“While the majority of Ameri­
cans may wish to ban pornogra­
phy, in the final analysis, society 
is better served by protecting 
our cherished right to free 
speech, even at the cost of toler­
ating speech that is outrageous, 
offensive and demeaning,” 
Scheindlin wrote.
In addition to violating the First 
Amendment, she found that the 
law infringes on the plaintiffs’ 
right to equal protection of the 
laws under the 14th Amendment 
and is unconstitutionally vague 
in violation of the Fifth Amend­
ment.
A government spokesman said
that federal prosecutors are re­
viewing the ruling and consider­
ing whether to appeal. General 
Media Communications Inc., 
which publishes Penthouse, and 
a group of trade associations sued 
the Defense Department in Octo­
ber to block enforcement of the 
Military Honor and Decency Act 
that restricts the dissemination 
of “sexually explicit material” 
within the U.S. military.
Michael Bamberger, whose law 
firm Sonnenschein Nath & 
Rosenthal represents General 
Media Communications, said that 
Scheindlin’s ruling “vindicates 
First Amendment rights for mili­
tary personnel and First Amend­
ment rights generally'’ because 
the decision is not limited to a 
military context.
The government argued that 
the law’s purpose is to promote 
military core values and improve 
the public perception of the mili­
tary. But Scheindlin said the ar­
guments were unpersuasive.
“A plain reading of the Act leads 
inevitably to the conclusion that 
it was drafted in an attempt to 
limit the sale and rental of 
nonobscene speech that Congress 
believed to be offensive and to 
penalize those who publish it by 
preventing its sale to military 
exchanges,” she said.
Cancer kills 
state senator
LOWELL, Mass, Jan. 23 (UPI) 
— Thousands of friends and dig­
nitaries gathered Thursday in 
Lowell, Mass, for the funeral of 
one-time Democratic presidential 
hopeful Paul Tsongas. The 55 
year-old former Massachusetts 
senator died Saturday night of 
pneumonia after years of battling 
cancer.
Tsongas left the Senate in 1984 
after developing lymph cancer. 
He suffered two recurrences of 
the cancer since then, the second 
in 1992 shortly shortly after his 
unsuccessful bid for the Demo­
cratic presidential nomination.
He underwent surgery earlier
this month to correct a blockage 
in his liver related to a second 
bone marrow transplant he re­
ceived last year in his long battle 
with lymphoma. It was while he 
was recuperating that he came 
down with pneumonia and died.
Efforts further 
AIDS research
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UPI) 
— Time magazine’s 1996 Man of 
the Year, AIDS researcher Dr. 
David Ho, has reported another 
promising step in experimental 
efforts to rid the body of the virus.
Ho, from New York’s Aaron Dia­
mond AIDS Research Center, told 
a conference Wednesday night 
that three-drug therapy can sup­
press the virus not just in the 
blood, but in lymph tissue.
Ho and other researchers 
sparked a frenzy of hope at last 
year’s international AIDS con­
ference in Vancouver by report­
ing that blending three drugs can 
drive the virus to such low levels 
that modem tests can’t find traces 
in the blood. The next question 
was whether the virus was still 
lurking elsewhere in the body.
Ho gave a partial answer to 
that question in his opening 
speech to the 4th Conference on 
Retroviruses and Opportunistic 
Infections. The patients he stud­
ied started therapy early, within 
90 days of infection. They com­
bined the older drugs AZT and 
3TC with one of a newer class, 
either ritonavir or indinavir.
Ho says samples of lymph tis­
sue from their guts show no sign 
of active, reproducing virus. He 
has found evidence of what may 
be trapped viral material, but 
says researchers do not know 
whether these traces are impor­
tant.
Ho emphasizes that the virus 
may still be hiding in the brain or 
other sanctuary. He is not ready 
to take the final bold step and 
recommend that patients stop 
taking the drugs altogether to 
see if they’re cured or if the virus 
bounces back.
First female Secretary of State assumes power
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UPI)
— Madeleine Albright took the 
helm Friday at the State Depart­
ment and began her day as the 
first female Secretary of State 
with a light breakfast before 
jumping into the job.
Although Albright was unable 
to announce any official decisions 
before Senate confirmation and 
her swearing-in, U.S. officials said 
she has already made several key 
personnel choices and “pretty 
much” decided on the itinerary 
of her first diplomatic journey.
U.S. officials said Albright’s first 
trip will take place during the 
second week of February and 
include stops in several Euro­
pean capitals as well as Japan 
and South Korea.
Meanwhile, she is expected to 
tap former Ambassador to Rus­
sia Thomas Pickering to hold 
the number-three job as 
undersecretary of state for po­
litical affairs. Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott will re­
main Albright’s No. 2 man for 
the time being.Carnegie Almanac
[Ed. Note: The following are 
excerpts from Madeleine 
Albright’s remarks at her first 
news conference as U.S. Secre­
tary of State Friday.]
NATO ENLARGEMENT 
AND RUSSIA: I think what is 
very important to keep in mind is 
the following: That we believe 
that it is essential to enlarge 
NATO.
We understand that the Rus­
sians have some problems with 
that. But what is clear is that 
both countries are committed to 
working the situation out and 
develop mutual understanding 
based on our national interests.
BOSNIA: ... are we going to 
keep our eye on the ball, which is 
to make sure that the various 
aspects of Dayton (the peace ac­
cords on Bosnia agreed at Dayton, 
Ohio in 1995) are carried out?
And now I am not in any way 
underestimating difficulties here 
... there are still bumps in the 
road as far as Bosnia is concerned. 
... But I do think again that we
have to keep in mind what amaz­
ing progress has taken place 
there and it is as a result of our 
insistence on carrying out the 
Dayton accords.
IRAN AND IRAQ CONTAIN­
MENT POLICY: We think that 
it’s very important to make clear 
that somebody cannot—nations 
cannot be involved in terrorism 
by night and have us deal with 
them during the day... we have to 
watch the actions of those two 
countries.
CUBA: I myself believe that it 
is a mistake to have a romantic 
view of Fidel Castro. He is a dic­
tator who runs his country in the 
way that dictators did in the ’50s 
and ’60s. Cuba is an embarrass­
ment to the Western Hemisphere, 
and I think we ought to keep 
making clear that there needs to 
be a change there.
CHINA AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS: I will tell it like it is on 
the human rights issues and on 
Hong Kong to the Chinese when 
I meet with them. I think the 
important point here is that we
understand the importance of 
Hong Kong as it reverts to China, 
that it has to be done in a way 
where the civil and human rights 
of the people who live in Hong 
Kong are respected.
I think it’s important, on the 
overall relationship with China, 
to understand that it is a multi­
faceted relationship. It cannot be 
held hostage to any one issue.
We have a set of issues that we 
deal with the Chinese, and we 
have some very positive relations 
with them and cooperation on, 
for instance on the issue of North 
Korea or Cambodia or CTBT/NPT 
(Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
and nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty) but there are some on 
which we differ and Human rights 
is one of them.
MIDDLE EAST: ... achiev­
ing a comprehensive peace is a 
very high priority for the presi­
dent and therefore also for me. 
... I believe that it is important 
for the secretary of state to be 
involved in the Middle East 
peace process.

CMU Sweepstakes rules.
The committee decided that 
buggies and their drivers must 
pass additional safety require­
ments before they would be per­

races.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Jan. 27, 
1992: The University of Pitts­
burgh, Carnegie Mellon, and 
Duquesne University pondered 
the idea of merging shuttle ser­
vices for the three schools. Stu­
dent Senate formed a committee 
to investigate the idea.
ONE YEAR AGO, Jan. 29,
1996: Carnegie Mellon commemo­
rated the 10-year anniversary of 
the space shuttle Challenger's 
explosion, on which Judith Resnik 
died.
Resnik was a CMU electrical 
engineering alumnus from the 
class of 1970.
Resnik was selected as a NASA 
astronaut in 1978, making her 
first space voyage on the maiden 
journey of Discovery.

Proposal promotes healthy living
HOUSING, from page 1
the seniority of those who signed 
up for it. If approved, wellness 
housing will cost the same as 
regular housing.
Those selected would agree to a 
contract that, in addition to a 
substance-free hall, would involve 
attending two health and well­
being workshops each semester. 
The proposal said, “Such housing 
would offer regular health and 
wellness programming, covering 
a wide variety of issues, includ­
ing: stress, sexual health, nutri­
tion, alcohol/drug education, al­
ternative health topics, and a 
wellness lifestyle network.”
“We don’t want the program to 
be restricted to wellness housing 
residents.
It wouldn’t be exclusive. There’d 
be opportunity for other students 
to attend,” said Barkin.
The proposal listed a number 
of details that have yet to be 
worked out and possible solutions 
to them.
For example, it hasn’t been 
decided what the consequences 
would be if a student broke the 
agreement. The proposal said, 
“Two violations of the wellness 
agreement will result in forced 
relocation to other campus hous­
ing.”
Wellness housing would require 
that the RA (Resident Assistant) 
do more than normal RAs are 
required to do. “In addition to
fulfilling the 
daily job re­
sponsibilities 
of an RA, the 
RA in
Henderson 
will need to 
support the 
mission of the 
Wellness pro­
gram in sev­
eral dimen­
sions: role
modeling, pro- 
gr amming, 
policy enforce­
ment, and in­
terfacing with 
Health Ser­
vices, Hous­
ing, and other 
affiliated of­
fices.” The pro­
posal stated 
that it would,
“recruit and 
select in Feb­
ruary 1997 an 
RA who both understands and 
actively supports the fulfillment 
of the Wellness Hall’s mission.” 
In order to deal with the addi­
tional demands, the RA would be 
given more training than regular 
RAs.
Barkin did emphasize that the 
purpose of the house isn’t to dis­
cipline students. “It is not in­
tended to be a highly restrictive 
environment; it’s intended to be
Henderson Hall, located on the Hill, is the proposed
an environment that’s educa­
tional and supportive,” said 
Barkin.
Barkin stressed that the pro­
gram is a small pilot program. 
“We will evaluate it over the 
course of the year and get lots of 
student feedback about what was 
helpful in the program and how 
we could improve upon it,” said 
Barkin.
When asked about the goals of

site for the Wellness program.
the project, Barkin said, “We 
know that students’ academic 
performance can be compromised 
if their physical, emotional, or 
spiritual health is compromised. 
We expect that there would be a 
positive influence on academic 
performance because students 
would gain a sense of well-being 
by incorporating preventative 
health strategies into their ev­
eryday living.”

CMU student
THOMPSON, from page 1
The founders of programs 
such as Filmmakers Outreach 
hope to continue bridging that 
gap between the school and the 
community, and in doing so, 
they want to involve the city’s 
universities as well. In regard 
to CMU, Young said, “He [Th­
ompson! wasn’t there long, but 
he gained such wonderful 
friendships, and the people that 
he bonded with are so talented 
and really played a large part 
in the college and the commu­
nity coming together.” 
Sandrene Matthews, another 
student who took part in the 
production, said, “I think it’s 
good that people are going out 
and trying to do something 
about it, and I think it’s good 
that it’s directed at high 
schoolers. High schoolers are 
more likely to listen to other 
high schoolers than adults.” 
Vernon B. Phillips, Jr., princi­
pal of Peabody High School also 
addressed the audience. “This 
is a fitting tribute to a young 
man with vision,” he said. “We 
can’t forget this speech for 
Peabody High School, this 
speech for our community, this 
speech for Pittsburgh ... for 
the nation.”
At the reception afterward, 
Washington, Shea, and Benard 
expressed an interest in con­
tinuing projects of this sort and 
adding a hands-on component. 
But for now, seeingThompson’s 
work come to the screen in an 
announcement soon to be dis­
tributed to all major media 
broadcasting stations is an im­
portant part of the healing pro­
cess for many of the people close 
to him. Tasha Lawson, reflect­
ing on Thompson’s death, said 
“It just made me more deter­
mined to provide a better life 
for her (their daughter, Tajaya) 
and for myself.” Young also 
presses on in spite of the diffi­
culty.
Though she considered leav­
ing Garfield, the neighborhood 
in which her son was murdered, 
she changed her mind. “I’m still 
there,” she said. “I thought, 
where am I gonna run? I had 
the choice of becoming bitter or 
better.” From all appearances, 
she chose the latter, like her 
son once advocated. “As I hold 
tight to my education and fam­
ily values and with the support 
of my mentors, I mean to rise 
above this quicksand. Maybe a 
few will grab onto me and find 
their way out as well.”
West Point cadet attains acquital during rape court-martial
WEST POINT, N.Y. Jan. 24 (Reuter) 
—A West Point cadet accused of raping 
a woman classmate was found not guilty 
Friday by an all-male jury of seven se­
nior army officers at the U.S. Military 
Academy.
Cadet James Engelbrecht, 22, a senior 
from Conroe, Texas, had been accused 
of raping the woman at the home of 
another cadet in Stockholm, New Jer­
sey, during a Memorial Day weekend 
party in 1996.
After the verdict, a relieved
Engelbrecht, who had faced possible life 
imprisonment, hugged his mother and 
father. “My man, I told you from the first 
day,” Paul Engelbrecht told his son.
The mother of the cadet who brought 
the charge cried as she and her three 
daughters pushed their way through a 
group of cadets celebrating around 
Engelbrecht.
“We expected this in a man’s world,” 
she said.
Engelbrecht was the first West Point 
cadet charged with the rape of a female
cadet since women were admitted to the 
prestigious military academy two de­
cades ago.
The jury took about five hours to reach 
the verdict in the small West Point 
courtroom, which had been the focus of 
a constant stream of visiting cadets dur­
ing the four-day trial.
Engelbrecht disputed the wman’s tes­
timony that she was raped, saying she 
had been the aggressor in a consensual 
sex encounter.
But in his closing argument Friday,
prosecuting attorney Capt. Dean Raab 
said the 20-year-old woman had no rea­
son to make up her story. Witnesses 
testified earlier the alleged victim was 
drunk on the night in question and 
Raab asked, “Does it make sense that 
someone in that condition would sud­
denly turn into a sexually aggressive 
predator in the middle of the night?” 
Engelbrecht’s attorney James 
Fitzgerald said in closing arguments 
that the woman had lied to investigators 
and kept changing her story. He said she
claimed memory lapses when confronted 
with inconsistencies.
“The fact that she did not remember 
what she was doing doesn’t excuse her. 
It was consensual,” Fitzgerald said.
The woman testified she had been drink­
ing at the time but had not consented to 
sex with Engelbrecht. An Army doctor 
confirmed the woman’s testimony that 
she had never had sexual intercourse be­
fore the incident. He also said he had not 
seen any bruises on her. She is now on 
leave from the military academy.
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
CMU screens 
for diabetes
Health Services will offer free 
diabetes screening in the 
McKenna and Peter rooms of 
the University Center from 8:30 
am to noon this Wednesday and 
Thursday.
The screening is open to fac­
ulty, staff, and students over 
25 years of age.
Sponsored by the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center 
in conjunction with CMU’s 
Health Services, the screening 
is intended to encourage the 
targeted groups — particularly 
those with risk factors — to get 
tested.
Risk factors include obesity, 
an immediate relative with dia­
betes, diabetes during preg­
nancy or delivery of a baby 
weighing more than nine 
pounds, or a history of high 
blood sugar.

Crime and Incident Report
1/21 MEDICAL, 6:53 am — 
Campus police were called to the 
Thistle Gymnasium, where they 
found an EMS medic attending 
to a student who had a one-half 
inch laceration in the upper lip. 
The victim had been doing pull- 
ups when the bar came off its 
hinges and hit him in the upper 
lip. The victim was taken to the 
University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center.
1/20 RECKLESS DRIVING,
7:06 pm—CMU police received a 
call about a dispute between a 
motorist and a cyclist. Upon re­
sponding to the call, police found 
that the motorist and the cyclist 
were involved in a relationship. 
They cyclist claimed that the 
driver of the car passed him at 
high speed while he was pedaling 
his bike in the righthand lane of 
Forbes Avenue.
The cyclist then said that he 
caught up with the driver when 
the car was stopped at a red light 
and demanded that the driver 
apologize. The driver then moved 
the car forward, hitting the cy­
clist in the legs with the car’s 
bumper. The cyclist pulled into 
the Morewood Gardens driveway 
and the two began to exchange 
words. The driver pulled away 
when police arrived.
1/20 ANIMAL ABANDON­
MENT, 1:37 pm —A CMU police 
officer was dispatched to the Tech 
Garage to investigate a report 
that a dog had been left in a car. 
Upon arriving, the officer met 
with a CMU security officer who 
pointed out that a small white 
dog had been left in a traveling 
cage on the back seat of a four- 
door Volkswagon Passat. The 
owner of the vehicle was identi­
fied but police were not able to 
contact him at the time.
1/25 THEFT, 2:40 — An em­
ployee of the University Shoppe 
reported to CMU police that a 
male, 40 -45 years of age, had set 
off an alarm upon exiting the 
store. The employee stopped the 
man and checked his bookbag, 
which contained about eight 
books. When the employee asked
to see the receipt for the books, 
the man handed her two books 
saying that he no longer wanted 
them. He then fled the area with 
the remaining six books. The 
man’s description, police noted, 
matches someone who had been 
arrested in 1995.
• Chief of Campus Police, 
James LaPaglia, reviews all re­
ports prior to release.
• Only three people on The 
Tartan staff see the reports: the 
Editor-in-Chief the News Edi­
tor, and the staffwriter typing 
the report.
• All personal names of com­
plainants, victims, suspects, 
and fraternity names are omit­
ted from the printed report. Eth­
nic descriptions and other per­
sonal details are given only in 
the context of complete descrip­
tions.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University27 January 1997
Hunt Library provides 
inadequate resources
Throughout national rankings 
colleges are often judged by the 
stature of the libraries they house 
on campus. Schools like Harvard 
and Yale have made their librar­
ies a top priority, which is obvious 
whenever a prospective student 
enters one of these facilities. These 
schools take pride in their re­
sources and it shows in the respect 
they receive as institutions dedi­
cated to learning.
According to U.S. News and 
World Report Carnegie Mellon 
spends approximately 70 percent 
more money per student each year 
than the University of Pittsburgh, 
yet their library facilities by far 
surpass those found on this cam­
pus.
Although we generally consider 
Pitt to be academically substan­
dard in comparison to CMU, Pitt 
administrators seem to have more 
concern for providing their stu­
dents with adequate research fa­
cilities than do our own. Ironi­
cally, CMU is recognized as one of 
the leading research institutions 
in the nation, but students here 
are often forced to look to other 
campuses in order to find appro­
priate materials for their work. 
While Hunt Library seems to be 
replete with books and periodi­
cals, most of these books are out­
dated and are no longer valuable 
for current research.
Construction on Hunt library be­
gan in mid-December but some 
the changes, such as the reloca­
tion of the reading room to the 
basement have actually worsened 
the situation. By moving all of the 
fiction material to the bottom floor 
of the library, the administration 
seems to be overlooking the im­
portance of books and reading for 
its own sake as a part of a student’s 
education. Many students are op­
posed to the actual conditions of 
the basement itself; the mustiness 
and lack of incandescent lighting 
make studying or relaxing unpleas­
ant.
As research becomes more de­
pendent on the internet, Hunt li­
brary fails to provide students with 
intemet-access facilities that meet 
the growing demand. In spite of 
this, the Hunt Library computer 
cluster is usually reserved for 
classes for at least four hours a day 
making it difficult for students to 
find an open computer for research 
purposes.
The minor renovations that are 
in progress do not address these 
concerns — while a new cluster 
has been included in the plan, it 
will be reserved for classes only. If 
CMU aspires to offer library facili­
ties that are on par with other 
renowned research universities, it 
must re-evaluate the priority given 
to its library system.
Parking problems need 
long-term solutions
Carnegie Mellon University is a 
rapidly growing institution. En­
rollment is increasing yearly, and 
new buildings are being built all 
over campus. But as great as this 
growth is, an important factor is 
being overlooked — parking.
Students at CMU find it almost 
impossible to find a place to park 
their cars. Parking permits are in 
extremely high demand, as CMU 
has less than 1800 parking places 
for the 7000 graduate, commuter, 
on-campus students, faculty and 
staff that drive to school each morn­
ing. It makes sense that on-cam- 
pus students receive their parking 
assignments only after everyone 
else who needs a car for daily com­
muting is granted a spot. How­
ever, it is becoming more and more 
the case that on-campus students 
can’t get a parking permit because 
there are no more spots available; 
without a permit from CMU, there 
are few other parking options. Stu­
dents who live in university-owned 
housing are not eligible for cheap 
residential parking permits from 
the city. Some solicit driveway 
space from local residents, but 
these students are the lucky few. 
In most cases, on-campus residents 
fight for street parking on the few 
non-permit streets throughout 
Squirrel Hill and Shadyside, or risk 
having their cars stolen from the 
poorly-policed areas around 
Schenley Park.
The administration does not con­
sider the parking crisis to be a 
serious situation. With the con­
struction of new buildings, more 
parking is lost — the construction 
of the University Center destroyed 
the Skibo lot, and the Purnell Cen­
ter will eliminate much of the 
Warner Hall parking area. Com­
mon sense dictates that a larger 
building will bring in heavier traf­
fic flow, and hence requires more

parking. The administration 
seems to feel that this is unneces­
sary, and had obtained a variance 
from the city to avoid having to 
increase parking at the UC.
The CMU Parking Office is un­
able to do anything about the prob­
lem. After the construction of the 
East Campus Garage, which in 
itself is a small and inadequate 
facility, the Parking Office was 
saddled with the debt for the $6 
million structure. Roughly half of 
the Parking Office’s income goes 
towards paying off the interest on 
the loan, leaving them in no posi­
tion to pay for new parking areas 
on campus. CMU has attempted 
alternatives, such as busing and 
carpooling, but the parking short­
age persists. The Parking Office 
will never be able to fund new 
projects until the Administration 
sees increased parking as a capital 
improvement for the University’s 
benefit, rather than the a concern of 
the Parking Office.
Temporary measures are not go­
ing to eliminate the lack of park­
ing on campus ¦— the Administra­
tion needs to seriously analyze the 
situation and come up with some 
long-term solutions. One possibil­
ity would be to look into making an 
arrangement with the City of Pitts­
burgh to allow CMU students to 
purchase residential parking per­
mits. If CMU purchased an off- 
campus parking area and added 
the lot to the shuttle route, on- 
campus students could leave their 
cars off-campus during the week 
and bring them on-campus for the 
weekend.
Whatever solution is chosen, the 
Administration must realize that 
parking space is an important fac­
tor in the growth of the campus, 
and that the situation will only 
worsen unless decisive action is 
taken soon.
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
The other night I 
went to see They Live 
with a friend at the 
University Center. I 
am an incurable 
movie fanatic and I’ve 
seen a number of movies at the UC and 
Doherty Hall; one dollar movie tickets 
are like gifts from God. Often there is no 
other way to see an older movie in 
Cinemascope, in its proper aspect ratio, 
instead of cramped videotape transfer.
And I’m very excited about the sched­
uled movies this semester.
Unfortunately, every time I see a movie 
there, it is increasingly difficult to actu­
ally watch the movie.
They Live was a very difficult experi­
ence due to a large group of people who 
chose to make jokes and comments on 
every scene. I understand enjoying a 
movie and yelling, “Don’t open that door!” 
and so forth. But constant talking and 
marginally funny comments that every­
one in the theater is meant to hear are 
simply distracting and makes it difficult 
for the rest of us to enjoy the movie. We 
all paid to get in and some of us are 
actually excited to show these movies to 
our friends and want them to be able to 
follow them. The couple in front of me 
kept having to ask each other “What did 
he say?” because they could not hear 
over the guys in the back. This has 
happened at a number of movies I’ve 
seen there and I’m not the only one; I 
know a number of people who are un­
willing to go there due to the noise. So, 
it’s actually costing the programmers 
money to continue this.
I ask the student body to please be 
more considerate and let the others en­
joy the movies just as much as the rest.

While reading Ja- L©TT©r TO 
son Siegendorfs at- till© Editor 
tack on Holocaust Re­
visionism (1/20/97), I was compelled to 
write a reply upon reading this sen­
tence, “Guns, like racism and anti- 
Semitism, are harmful to society, and so 
we regulate and restrict them even 
though the second amendment is very 
clear.” I was inspired to wonder if the 
writer believes the Constitution to be 
just a bunch of suggestions.
It seems necessary to me that it be 
interpreted as an agreement for all 
Americans to conduct their social inter­
actions by. If the majority can violate it 
as their judgement commands, then any­
one may violate it as they are capable, 
and maybe everyone should.
Any violation of the Constitution is 
promoting the dissolution of our 
government.If the writer is suggesting 
that private schools such as Carnegie 
Mellon deny these revisionists the right 
to speak on their campuses since they 
spread falsehood, I agree with him, ex-
cept that I think the likelihood of their 
views being truth should be judged by 
the history department, and not an ECE 
major.
However, the existence of public uni­
versities inevitably raises a question 
difficult to answer in a society which 
respects the abstract “right to free 
speech.” This question is, “Should pub­
lic resources that are used to promote 
one group’s views be denied to another 
group because the majority finds these 
views ‘nonsense’ which ‘cannot possibly 
benefit society5?”
Of course, even public universities 
cannot give equal voice to every view 
and cannot promote any views, so if they 
are to exist, their administrations must 
discriminate against those views in 
which they find no value.
If you wish to argue that the govern­
ment in no way discourages the revi­
sionists from spreading their views, let 
me remind you that it is their money as 
well as yours which is supporting the 
public universities and which could be 
used to spread their own views.
Let me end by quoting from John 
Stuart Mill’s On Liberty. “There is the 
greatest difference between presuming 
an opinion to be true because, with ev­
ery opportunity for contestingi’t, has not 
been refuted, and assuming its truth for 
the purpose of not permitting its refuta­
tion.”

Cluster hammocks would ease anxiety
Pengung
I begin this week 
with an apology — 
to Bill Boyle, senior 
architecture stu­
dent, and Pete 
Barbalias, coordi­
nator of Student
“Hammock clusters would each be 
staffed with RCons, relaxation con­
sultants, who could suggest tips for 
relaxation and dealing with anxiety. ”
Life for SuiteSide. Bill and Pete have been working together 
this year to increase community members’ involvement in 
their University Forum program, which convenes every few 
weeks to discuss issues of interest to this campus. Bill Boyle 
rightly pointed out this past week that it was not fair of me 
to declare that CMU has no community forum in place 
currently because he, Pete, and many other people are devel­
oping just the kind of forum that I proposed in my column.
To show my apology, I will incorporate the topics of each 
University Forum session as those sessions are held. In this
way, participants may con- _____________________________
tinue discussions well af­
ter the original gathering 
concludes.
The suggestion that I 
propose this week for help­
ing Carnegie Mellon com­
munity members relax 
comes not from one par­
ticular response, but from
a variety of ideas and gripes expressed by the people who 
contacted me.
I think we should create “hammock clusters” all over 
campus.
There are computer clusters all over this campus that 
directly or indirectly generate anxiety for all of us from time 
to time. Your documents will not print. Your term paper gets 
chewed up in a faulty disk drive.
Sometimes you can’t even get onto a machine because some 
wizard is using Netscape to download Playboy’s complete 
collection of Jenny McCarthy photos. Game players get the 
boot without hesitation, but Web browswers have equal 
rights to the computers as the rest of us. Cluster computer 
users wear sour faces all the time, it’s true, but often those 
faces express justifiable frustration.
We all need well-equipped working facilities at our disposal 
in this community, and Computing Services meets those 
needs with efficiency.
We also need to create focal points for student relaxation. 
Steve Sitrin, director of the University Center, and the UC 
staff have given us some very good starting points. But we 
cannot dispatch the problem with just one building. Hence, 
the hammock cluster concept.
Find several large rooms in the academic buildings around 
campus that can be partitioned off into smaller areas. In each 
small room, place a hammock with pillow and blanket and an 
alarm clock so folks on siesta can wake up in time. No
computer hookups, no phone jacks, nothing but a quiet place 
to sleep or relax for a while.
There should be individually controlled lights with dim­
mers and piped in music — relaxation tunes, not “music” in 
the Trent Reznor sense of the word.
Hammock clusters would each be staffed with RCons. 
relaxation consultants, who could suggest tips for relaxation 
and dealing with anxiety.
These people would be hired and trained by Counseling 
and Psychological Services, just as CCons are hired and 
trained by Computing Services. Optimally, these clusters 
would be located in academic buildings near computer clus­
ters and labs, so that students working on intense projects 
could take a break without difficulty at any time of the day 
or night.
True, there are a number of student lounge facilities 
around campus already, but many of them, like the
_____________________________ Schoenwald Lounge in
Baker Hall, are restricted 
to students from one de­
partment or college and 
get locked up at night. 
Even when lounges are 
open, they feature mainly 
chairs and small couches, 
not exactly the stuff of 
truly world-class nap­
ping.
More importantly, at a basic level many people are not 
comfortable falling asleep in a publicly accessible space, for 
reasons of security and insecurity.
At least in a hammock cluster you could lock yourself and 
your valuables into your room.
Out in the corporate world, businesses are learning that to 
keep their employees happy and productive, they need to 
lessen workloads and offer benefits in the workplace, like 
relaxation facilities that make life on the job more tolerable. 
We’re human beings, and we should design our environment 
for humans, not Stepford Student problem set machines. 
Our workloads remain at the behest of the professors and

Ebonics: Should it be an official language?
The ‘language’ provides cultural pride
isHo ckuuy
A recent article in Harper’s Magazine 
(January 1997), discussed Kwanzaa, a 
festival based loosely on African ritual 
and celebration, created by California 
University Professor of black studies 
Maulana Karenga. Karenga describes 
the holiday as a method to “give a Black 
alternative to the existing holiday and 
give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate 
themselves.” It embodies all of the ide­
als that Christmas or the Fourth of July 
do (or should) like purpose, creativity, 
faith, and unity.
Now in the news, there is talk of an­
other “festival,” one not celebrated on a 
single day or a span of days but one that 
will be based on the acceptance of one 
basic tenet. Ebonics (e&ony + phoraics) is 
a movement that states that inner-city 
African-Americans and Latinos should 
be taught at a young age that their 
language, the language of their streets, 
is a valid form of communication and 
that it can be easily compared to a more 
standard form of English.
There was a great outcry against this 
movement. It was ridiculed. It was 
passed over as an effort, John Leo wrote 
in U.S. News and World Report (1/20/ 
97), to move African-Americans out of 
one racial cocoon into another created 
by language.
But what is the future of Ebonics? At 
this rate, it will never be institutional­
ized; there are too many people against 
it. However, it is a stepping stone, just 
as Kwanzaa is a stepping stone. No one, 
regardless of their nationality, can ex­
cel in the U.S. without a firm grasp of 
the English language. But if Ebonics is 
taught, coupled with an effort to teach 
standard English, somethingimportant 
may happen.
A young African-American man will 
find that he speaks two languages, one 
with his school-mates and one with his 
professors and future employers. In the 
classroom, the use of Ebonics root's the
use of standard English in a powerful 
context: he can use what he already 
knows (the language of his streets) as a 
stepping stone into a more formal En­
glish. He is empowered first by an ac­
ceptance of his own language, and then 
by the augmentation of it.
The young man is not speaking a com­
pletely foreign language—his language 
has been accepted and taught by his 
school.
Therefore, he is not an outsider. In­
stead, he is simply learning a different 
form of his origi­
nal speech-style, 
one that is ac­
cepted into the 
culture.
Ebonics, too, is 
a method to “give 
a Black alterna­
tive to the exist­
ing [idiom] and 
give Blacks an 
opportunity to 
celebrate them­
selves.” Just as 
Kwanzaa is not 
designed to re­
place Christmas,
Ebonics is not de­
signed to replace 
standard En­
glish, and never 
will. Instead, it 
acts as a buffer 
between the 
speaker and the 
world, just as a 
group of Polish-,
French-, Russian-, or Irish-Americans 
feel comfortable in expressing their 
voices and celebrations through their 
own culture. Everyone, regardless of 
race, creed, or color, must begin 
somewhere.Students who are schooled 
in Ebonics will understand that Ebonics 
will not be wholly accepted in the U.S., 
but they are given some time to think 
about how they can make standard En­
glish work for them, not against them.

Writer finds Ebonics insulting, harmful
The conflict lies in the separation of 
Ebonics and Standard American En­
glish. Recognized as slang, a derivation 
of English and other African languages, 
Ebonics comes naturally to the students 
Oakland has professed to “re-educate.” 
Yet, this natural affinity has been struck 
down by the Oakland Board as being 
wrong, and that, by teaching the school 
children correct English, they will 
therein learn to “read, write, and speak 
proficiently in standard American lan­
guage,” according to the Synopsis of the 
Adopted Policy on Standard American 
English Language Development as re­
leased by the OUSD.
What are the connotations of their 
action? First and foremost, it subtly 
states that the color of one’s skin de­
termines what type of language one 
speaks. Second, it gives titular impor­
tance to something generally regarded 
as slang. Third, and most importantly, 
the separation of black English and 
Standard American English can be 
seen as another parallel of the separa­
tion between black and white. The 
school board’s written policy denies 
that “Ebonics further segregates an 
already divided school district.” That 
is exactly what OUSD is doing.
They are separating bad English, or 
black English, from correct English 
by making a special case for these sup­
posedly language-deficient individuals.
It is this separate treatment that 
can and will have further mental and 
societal ramifications on the black 
schoolchildren affected. Who wants to 
know that every time they open their 
mouth, they are wrong?
The beginning of a second Presiden­
tial term has always been a time of 
hope, reflection, and promise for the 
people of the U.S.
The rights and wrongs of Ebonics 
are currently being debated on Capi­
tol Hill. Let’s hope Congress agrees 
that the decision of the Oakland 
United School District turns out to be 
the wrong one.
Wata hUk
The beginning of a second Presidential 
term has always been a time of hope, 
reflection, and promise for the people of 
the U.S. This “promise” is part of the 
newly-inaugurated President William J. 
Clinton’s plan to build a “land of New 
Promise,” where 
liberty presides 
and justice perse­
veres and our chil- 
dren speak ... 
Ebonics? What???
This disjointed 
vision of the fu­
ture has its foun­
dations in the de­
cision by the Oak­
land [Ca.] United 
School District 
(OUSD) to train 
public school in­
structors in the 
black English, or 
Ebonics, of Afri- 
can-American 
students. This is 
so the teachers 
will better under­
stand their black 
students’ 
“tongue,” so to 
speak. Ebonics
Anthony Yu/ Tartan Art Staff be uged ag a
model for what is “bad,” while the Stan­
dard American English that “normal” 
(read: white) people speakis “good.” Lan­
guage is the purest form of expression, 
and the Oakland board has stated that 
this form of expression is wrong.
Despite the nobility and idealism of 
OUSD’s decision, this same decision 
serves to undermine and move backwards 
the cultural acceptance of African-Ameri­
cans. In the recognition ofblack English as 
a second and inferior language, the Oak­
land board has unwittingly associated 
negative connotations with lives that are 
probably socially negative enough.

Columnist finds modem romantic music lyrics inane
rnbnccU FgkbuyH
Confession: I’m tone deaf. Com­
pletely. In fact, I wouldn’t be able 
to tell the difference between 
Mozart and Metallica if it weren’t 
for the fact that one has words 
and the other doesn’t. So when­
ever I hear a song, Ican’t help but 
pay close attention to the lyrics. 
Others might talk about inspira­
tional guitar solos or the ener­
getic bass in the background. I 
just notice when the words don’t 
quite rhyme. Perhaps, then, it 
was inevitable that sooner or later 
I’d realize that popular song lyr­
ics are inane beyond belief.
I had always been under the 
impression that music was an 
art, and that art was supposed to 
reflect life. But from the looks of 
the world through song lyrics, we
are not in a good state at all. 
Lyrics aim to reduce the entire 
human condition to four moods 
and only four: the full, happy, 
nauseating bloom of love; unre­
quited pining; raw screeching 
betrayal; and excruciating sensi­
tivity. The only thing of any worth, 
according to all these songs, is 
romantic love and once you’ve got 
that, you’ve got it made.
Whatever. Listening to music 
is what reading would be if your 
only choices of literature were 
three parts trashy romance nov­
els to one part Hallmark Cards.
It’s the musicians’ God-given 
right to spend whole albums at a 
time repeating that they love their 
sweetheart “more and more each 
day/in each and everyway.” Ugh.
Come on, isn’t there more than 
that? Life is not just passion but 
friendship, familial love, school, 
work, good books, playing in the 
snow, and that caffeine rush you 
get after washing down a bag of
chocolate-covered coffee beans 
with a can of Coke. Songs would 
be much better if singers could be 
bothered to take some of this stuff 
into account.
I know the music on the radio 
isn’t supposed to be taken so seri­
ously. Certainly I’m not suggest­
ing that all bands should write 
informed treatises on the pros 
and cons of the European Eco­
nomic Community and set them 
to a beat. I simply think 
songwriters should have figured 
out by now how to write involving 
songs about everything that 
moves us. I mean, instead of a 
badly-written song about the he­
donistic pleasure of your lover’s 
arms, would it kill anyone to write 
and perform a well-written song 
about the hedonistic pleasure of, 
say, a good slice of pizza? Or a 
tender but non-sickening song 
about how much your friends 
mean to you? Alittle variety never 
hurt anyone.
Admittedly, romantic love, or 
the lack thereof, is a big part of 
almost everyone’s life. So, if mu­
sicians want to sing about love as 
much as the average college stu­
dent talks about sex, then fine. I 
can deal with it. But they could 
give it credit for being the com­
plex emotion that it is.
My problem isn’t the ubiquity 
of love songs; it’s that they make 
being in love sound like such an 
insipid condition.
An example: “Oh yeah, so in 
love with you1 oh yeah, it’s too 
good to be true/ oh yeah, feeling 
so brand new/ oh yeaaaaaah.” 
Every couple I’ve ever known has 
managed to express their feel­
ings for each other in more origi­
nal language than this. And once 
the euphorialifts, don’t you think 
real people can come up with a 
more heartfelt plea than “What­
ever I said/ whatever I did/1 didn’t 
mean it/1 just want you back for 
good”? The same goes for excur­
sions into what can very loosely 
be called words of wisdom. No 
one’s asking for Jean-Paul Sartre, 
but if someone’s expecting us to 
listen to their penetrating in­
sights, they could at least try and 
make sure they’re somewhat in­
sightful.
Not to cast aspersions on the 
noted thinker Sheryl Crow, but 
surely even Hallmark could come 
up with a better philosophy of life 
than “Every day is a winding road/ 
I get a little bit closer/ Every day 
is a faded sign/ I get a little bit 
closer to feeling fine.”
Or maybe it’s a lost cause. 
Maybe I should just give up hear­
ing anything particularly worth­
while on the radio and take my 
tone-deaf self to listen to some­
thing by that great 18th century 
composer, Metallica.

Tartans beat W&J
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
CMU’s swimming teams traveled to 
Washington & Jefferson College last 
Wednesday and came away with two 
victories.
“Very, very seldom do we have a meet 
during the week,” said head coach David 
Belowich. As a result, “we didn’t focus a 
lot on this meet,” Belowich said. The 
men won 129-75 while the women 
outswam the opponent 108-88. There 
was no diving, and every person that 
CMU took to the meet scored in at least 
one event.
“We’re in a situation with the men 
where we’re pretty strong and pretty 
deep,” Belowich said. The Tartans have 
two meets remaining before the UAA 
Championships, Febuary 20-22 at the 
University of Rochester.
“Johns Hopkins is the team to beat. 
They’ve won it the last couple of years,” 
coach Belowich said of the men’s competi­
tion. After Johns Hopkins, one of the top- 
five division HI teams in the nation, the 
coach sees a big battle for second. Emory, 
Washington University, Rochester, CMU, 
and probably NYU are all contenders.
Junior Jake McGuire said the men 
should be good enough for 2nd and the 
women could move up into the top four.
“We should have a couple of people get
to nationals, so that should be pretty 
exciting,” McGuire said.
“The key thing about the champion­
ships is that’s the meet that everybody 
has been look forward to, for forever,” 
said Belowich.
According to Belowich, Emory’s 
women are in the top 10 in the land and 
should capture the UAA crown. The 
rest of the women’s field is apparently 
too close to call. “I haven’t seen Chi­
cago or Wash. U,” Belowich said, but 
mentioned that NYU and Rochester 
should fare well.
For the first time in many years, 
CMU also has a diving squad to take.
“It’s hard because none of these 
people have ever dived before,” 
Belowich said of the group, which 
currently consists of three men and 
one woman.
Kara Sixbury, the new diving coach, 
was an All-American diver under 
Belowich at Pitt and coached under 
Belowich last year. Belowich, who has 
been coaching for over 25 years, is in 
his first year at CMU.
“She’s a very good teacher, as 
well as [the divers] being a good 
group,” Belowich said of Sixbury.
Please the see CMU’s times and places 
of Wednesday’s meet with Washington 
and Jefferson below.

swim teams faster, stronger
SWIMMING, from page 10
calendars didn’t occur.
The team swam two-hour practices, 
twice a day, in addition to running and 
weight training. CMU shared two 50 
meter pools and four high school pools 
with 71 other colleges in the 61st year of 
training at the International Swimming 
Hall of Fame.
“Every pool was filled from 6 am to 10 
pm,” coach Belowich said.
After their first week back from the 
break, the team traveled to New York 
City for two days of competition. On Fri­
day, the Tartans raced Columbia. A flat 
tire on the team’s bus caused a two - hour 
wait and eventually delayed the meet.
“Columbia is a little bit out of our 
league,” the coach said. Belowich specu­
lated that both Columbia teams should 
place in the top four in the Ivy League. 
Columbia outscored CMU’s women and 
men 138-76 and 124-97 respectively. 
The team swam strongly, in what 
Belowich described as an “unusual, un­
expected” showing.
“Jake McGuire in particular swam 
well,” Belowich said.
“I concentrated on beating the guy 
beside me and I pulled it off,” McGuire
said of his performance at the meet. 
“They’re a pretty good division one team, 
so the challenge was there.”
The next day CMU took on both New 
York University and the U.S. Mer­
chant Marine. The meet was in fact 
two meets for all three teams. Each 
school was scored against its two com­
petitors, with places and times from 
the third team ignored.
“It’s known as a double dual meet,” 
said Belowich.
CMU’s women fell to NYU 43-65, but 
were triumphant over MM 77-13.
The men also defeated the Merchant 
Marine easily, 69-24, but NYU showed 
more competition.
“NYU came down to the last relay,” 
coach Belowich said. CMU trailed with 
two events remaining.
“Chris Howser won the breast stroke, 
so we had to win the last race, which we 
did,” Belowich said.
The victories would turn out to be 
Belowich’s 99th and 100th for his head 
coaching career. Belowich explained he 
had found out that he was about to reach 
the milestone, by accident.
“When I came back from Florida, my 
wife had a stack of things I had to sort
through or throw away,” Belowich said.
Looking through the stack, the coach 
came across his own resume and saw 
his record.
“And I thought, ‘Oh wow, look at that,’ 
” the coach said.
“The best part of it is the fact that I 
never swam a stroke. I’ve been very 
fortunate to be around some very 
classy swimmers and divers,” 
Belowich said. “It was the collected 
effort of those individuals and I feel 
good about that.”

Coach David Belowich has been a head 
coach for 14 years and is enjoying his first 
at Carnegie Mellon.

Associated Press, Jan. 26
Redskins Pass on Shuler
The Washington Redskins reportedly 
have taken the first step in getting rid of 
high-salaried backup quarterback Heath 
Shuler by not picking up the two-year, 
$8 million option on his contract. The 
Washington Post quotes an advisor to 
Shuler as saying that the team did not 
notify the quarterback by Saturday’s 
deadline about picking up the option.
In turn, the 6-2, 221-pound Shuler 
has eight days to tell the Redskins if he 
chooses to void the remainder of the 
contract, something advisor Roger 
Jenkins told the Post that will be done 
early in the week. Shuler was selected 
six rounds ahead of Redskins starter 
and Pro-Bowler Gus Frerotte in the 1994 
draft.
The third overall pick in the draft out 
of Tennessee was bestowed an eight- 
year, $19 million contract that had a 
void provision after the third season.
Super Mario
guins to a 5-2 victory over 
the Montreal Canadiens. 
Lemiuex’s 10th career four- 
goal game gave the Penguins 
their first win in Montreal 
since 1988.
Lemieux’s effort marked 
the 11th time in league his- 
ry that a player has scored four 
n a period, and the fifth time it 
¡n done in the final period. 
Washington’s Peter Bondra was the last 
player with four in a period, scoring four 
times in the first against Tampa Bay on 
February 5, 1994.
In the only other NHL match Sunday, 
Daniel McGillis scored twice to lift the 
Edmonton Oilers to a 3-1 victory over 
the Capitals at Washington.
Sampras Wins Australian Final
Pete Sampras won his ninth Grand 
Slam tennis title Sunday by demolish­
ing Spaniard Carlos Moya in the Aus­
tralian Open final. Sampras, the 1994 
champion and top seed, beat the 
unseeded Moya 6-2,6-3,6-3. Both men 
started strongly, serving aces in their 
opening service games, but the Ameri­
can top seed broke Moya’s serve in the 
fourth game of the match and never 
looked back. Moya, a natural baseliner, 
was unable to produce the kind of all­
round court game that earned him wins 
over defending champion Boris Becker 
and world number two Michael Chang 
on his way to. the final.
Jones Wins Phoenix Open
Mario Lemieux tied an NHL record by U.S. Open champion Steve Jones came
scoring four times in the third period within one stroke of the PGA Tour record 
Sunday, leading the Pittsburgh Pen- for lowest 72-hole score and he cruised
to an 11-shot victory at the Phoenix 
Open in Scottsdale, Arizona Sunday. 
Jones’ four-round total of 26-under- 
par 258 was one stroke short of the 72- 
hole record set by Mike Souchak at the 
1955 Texas Open.
But it was more than enough for his 
sixth career victory. Jones had a final- 
round 4-under 67, his worst round of 
the tournament. Jesper Pamevik, a 
Swede who plays out of Florida, 
matched Jones’ 67 and grabbed sole 
possession of second place at 15-under 
269. Nick Price was third. He shot a 2- 
under 69, but was 12 strokes behind 
Jones at 14-under 270.
Jordan Tops All-Star Tally
Chicago Bulls guard Michael Jor­
dan Sunday became the first player 
ever to receive more than two million 
votes in one season as the final returns 
of fan balloting for the 1997 NBA All- 
Star Game were released. Jordan led 
all NBA vote-getters for the eighth 
time in his career with 2,451,136. He 
will be joined in the Eastern Confer­
ence All-Star starting lineup by Or­
lando Magic guard Penny Hardaway, 
Detroit Pistons forward Grant Hill, 
Bulls forward Scottie Pippen and New 
York Knicks center Patrick Ewing.
Forwards Charles Barkley of the 
Houston Rockets and Shawn Kemp of 
the Seattle SuperSonics were the top 
vote-getters in the Western Confer­
ence. Joining Barkley and Kemp on 
West All-Star team are Houston cen­
ter Hakeem Olajuwon, Seattle guard 
Gary Payton and Utah Jazz guard 
John Stockton. The NBA All-Star 
Game will be played in Cleveland on 
February 9.
Injury bug hits NHL
From the Point
by Jason Andracki
jury re- 
p orts, 
you’re 
likely to 
mistake 
it for the 
scoring 
leaders
due to the amount of high caliber play­
ers that have suffered injuries this sea­
son. Names like Joe Sakic and Zigmund 
Palffy have been seen there and others 
like Pat LaFontaine, are already out for 
the remainder of the season and possi­
bly their career. Even hockey’s answer 
to Cal Ripkin Jr., Trevor Linden, has 
been felled by a knee injury.
Last week’s Sports Illustrated featured 
an article on the increase of concussions 
this season. In doing so, they compared 
the helmets of Wayne Gretzky and 
Jaromir Jagr, they showed that most of 
these injuries could be prevented by 
wearing the proper helmet. Gretzky’s 
helmet is the same Jofa model you can 
pick up at a sporting goods store for 
about $30. It won’t even give you the 
proper protection for dekhockey or in­
line skating, much less ice hockey. In 
response to the increase in head injuries 
man}7 players like Eric Lindros (whose 
brother’s career never truly began thanks 
to concussions) sported a new Bauer 
helmet at the All Star game that offers 
better protection.
Goaltenders have also been hit par­
ticularly hardby injurieso. DarrenPuppa 
has missed most of the season as has 
Tom Barrasso. This has opened up op­
portunities for backup goaltenders to 
shine, especially in Pittsburgh’s case. 
With Barrasso out, the starting job went 
to Ken Wreggett, with Patrick Lalime 
being called up from the minors. Wreggett 
was also injured, so rookie Lalime ended 
up as the number one goalie in his first 
season. Lalime, who just surpassed Ken 
Dryden’s rookie record and was shooting 
for Grant Fuhr’s before he dropped his 
last two games (to bring his record to 14- 
2-2), has performed so well that Barrasso 
is now out of a job.
A high velocity, contact sport like 
hockey is expected to have its share of 
injuries. Most of these injuries are part 
of the game, but it’s a shame that some 
could have been avoided if players just 
wore the proper equipment. It’s even 
more shameful when the NHL fails to 
reprimand a player like Francois 
Leroux, who’s lucky if he gets one shift 
per period, for a flagrant elbow oh Pat 
LaFontaine that may end his career. 
The NHL must try to keep its super­
stars on the ice (rather than the train­
ing table) by stricter rule enforcement 
of play and equipment.
Jason Andracki is a senior profes­
sional writing major. He witnessed two 
of the greatest goals last week at the All- 
Star game - the Gretzky to Lemieux 
tally and Owen Nolan’s third for which 
he picked his corner a la Babe Ruth.

night to end the period with CMU 
leading 8-0.
If the second period was for 
scoring, then the third was just 
plain hockey. Indiana’s frus­
trated, restlessness play only in­
creased CMUs high spirits. CMU 
scored 30 seconds into the period, 
with Voulgaris and Buck assist­
ing Adukaitis for his second of 
the game.
Suddenly the game got very 
rough. An IUP player skated 
full tilt into Ardire, trying to 
trip the scoring machine. But it 
was the IUP player who was 
rendered helpless on the ice, a 
victim of his own misplaced ag­
gression. He left the game and 
was transported to Allegheny
General for possible neck 
trauma. IUP took their fallen 
partner as an incentive to pick 
fights, incurring more penalties 
and delaying the game further.
With a 10:20 pm curfew on the 
ice and 12 minutes left in the 
game, the IUP squad eventually 
decided to continue on. Tighten­
ing their chin straps, CMU con­
tinued to steamroll the flailing 
opposition. Shorthanded, sopho­
more SteveLeonhardt controlled 
the puck long enough to get it to 
Maddalena on the blue line in the 
offensive zone.
Maddalena took the puck down 
and slid it in on the lower far post. 
The team rejoiced, not only over 
the now 10-0 lead, but to see 
their leader persevere to come

back from injury and score his 
first goal in almost a year. Com­
mented Coach Maddalena, “ 
We’ve been waiting a long time 
for him to score. It was nice to see 
him make that play.”
The rout continued, and so did 
the confrontations. Minutes af­
ter the Maddalena goal, Ardire 
finished what he started. 
Grzywacz gave the puck to 
Fitzgerald in the CMU zone and 
Fitzgerald moved the disk quickly 
to Ardire, who faked out the IUP 
goalie and scored triumphantly. 
Seven minutes and six penalties 
(all for roughing) later, CMU 
skated to the locker room with an
11-0 victory and a perfect record 
in 1997.
“We waited all year for this, to 
beat a good team and beat them 
soundly,” Coach Maddalena said, 
“And Jon got his shut-out.”
It was well deserved. CMU 
outshot IUP 34-12. Khegman was 
happy with the win: “I think that
this shut out has to go to the 
team. Basically all that I did was 
stay awake long enough to close 
my glove on any pucks they 
shoved in there. I just hope that I 
get my next one against Pitt!” 
Anthony Paul summed it up, 
“We’re sending a message to the 
league. CMU is here to win.” 
CMU’s record before Sunday’s 
exhibition game against the Pitts­
burgh Stars was 7-6-1 overall.

Thankfully, the game was still an exciting' 
one at this point and my guests were too ' 
busy discussing this, eating pizza, drink-”

bothered by second-rate antics.
The SuperBowl has always been a good way1 
to get insight into the major developments in' 
society, the current one being the explosive 
growth of the Information Age. Sunday’s game 
made this clear mainly in two ways: the large 
number of ads relating to the Internet and 
computers, and the fact that viewers world­
wide could vote for the game MVP via the' 
Internet for the first time, (for those of you

several hours cleaning up the place in prepa­
ration for the arrival of our friends; we were 
hosting a SuperBowl party. About two hours 
before kickoff, with a Reggie White inter­
view playing for the three-thousandth time, 
my roommate turns around and asks, “So, 
who is Green Bay playing today?” This got 
me thinking.
The SuperBowl has become such an 
important event that even people who didn’t 
know who Brett Favre and Drew Bledsoe 
were spent a great deal of the day preparing 
to watch these two men compete. An esti­

would have been 4:30 in the morning.
Sunday’s game, which was actually good for 
a full three quarters, was broadcasted in as 
many languages as you can think of off the top 
of your head, and probably inspired a young 
Mongolian boy to kill a pig. The growing 
popularity of American Football has been 
helped immensely by world-wide exposure of 
the SuperBowl. There is a reasonably suc­
cessful World Football League including 
teams like the London Monarchs, the 
Edinburgh Claymores, and the Frankfurt 
Galaxy. But why do so many people, most of 
whom don’t have any allegiance to either 
team, to dedicate so much time and interest 
to this one game?
Well, in this country, the single biggest 
reason is the advertising. I know people who 
have jokingly said that they only watch the 
game for the commercials, but I’m beginning 
to think they actually mean it. And why not ? 
SuperBowl ads, beingthe most expensive, are 
the most entertaining to watch.
When you know there are some small 
firms who spend their entire annual adver­
tising budget on a thirty-second SuperBowl 
spot, you’ve got to expect something good. 
Sunday’s highlights were the ads for Nissan,
SuperBowl XXXI remained entertaining 
right through the first three quarters. But by 
the start of the fourth, it was clear that many 
of my guests, most of whom hadn’t seen a 
football game since, oh, this time last year, 
were beginning to lose interest. Around that 
time, my roommate said, “I hear ‘Spies Like 
Us’ is playing on channel 66.” Now we had a 
problem; watching Chevy Chase and Dan 
Akroyd save the world, or watching the tradi­
tional AFC sacrificial offering die a slow and 
painful death?
We had to vote. On the slim possibility the 
Pats would pull off a miracle in the last ten 
minutes, football won by a very slim margin. 
We shouldn’t have bothered — by the middle 
of the fourth we were too busy eating and 
taking trips to the bathroom to notice what 
was happening on the screen.
Apparently, the Green Bay Packers beat 
the New England Patriots by a score of 35- 
21. I believe a few thousand people said, 
about nine months ago, this would happen. 
Why do we bother ?

Hockey destroys IUP
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
CMU hosted Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania Saturday night at 
Neville Arena. IUP was the worst kind 
of guest: belligerent, dirty, and mean. 
But the Tartans played the perfect 
host: strong, smart, and steady. IUP 
never had a chance, thife was not the 
same CMU squad that they had beaten 
in the first semester. CMU rolled over 
IUP, 11-0, with starting goalie Jon 
Kliegman registering his first shut­
out since March of 1993.
The first period started quietly. CMU 
was having trouble clearing the defen­
sive zone, and the IUP team swarmed 
all over until the second line burst into 
action. Senior forward Ray Ardire went 
coast-to-coast for the first goal, draw­
ing the goalie down to his knees and 
easily putting the puck in the net. It 
would be the first of his four goals on 
the night that left ItJP reeling in frus­
tration. He would score again in the 
first period with the puck sent from 
junior forward Scott Fitzgerald to se­
nior Anthony Paul, who found Ardire 
in front. Ardire put the puck five hole 
and CMU was up 2-0 at the start of the 
second period.
CMU was skating hard in the sec­
ond, lead by the defensive pair of jun­
ior Paul Voulgaris and freshman P. J. 
Grzywacz. Both would have two as­
sists for the night thanks to Voulgaris’s 
hard hitting to keep the puck free in 
the offensive zone, and Grzywacz’s 
strong puck-handling skills. Head

coach Fred Maddalena said, “P.J. 
played his best game to date on the 
team and that was important without 
Bryan (Campo) being here.”
But the second period was fueled by 
a flurry of six goals, with each line 
contributing. The third line started 
the attack on IUP’s tender; their pass­
ing-work moving them repeatedly into 
scoring position. It was junior Derek 
Jander that connected with Grzywacz, 
who brought the puck up the far boards 
and passed to sophomore Andy Ox­
nard. Oxnard looped the puck into the 
net, making it 3-0 CMU.
On the next shift, the first line added 
to the lead when senior assistant cap­
tain Chris Adukaitis snaked the puck 
in the middle of the net, behind the 
IUP goalie, on a feed from graduate 
student captain Roger Maddalena and 
senior Jim Buck.
IUP then pulled their starting 
goalie. It didn’t do much good. Forty 
seconds later, the veteran forwards 
connected again, this time with 
Maddalena starting the play and 
Adukaitis setting Buck to walk right 
into IUP territory and scoop in the 
puck to a nearly open net, 5-0.
The onslaught continued 20 sec­
onds later with a fresh Tartan second 
line on the ice. Paul, with superb 
control, passed to Ardire in the middle. 
Ardire cruised towards the IUP net 
and continued his crushing domina­
tion of the game by scoring his third 
goal of the night.
The second line continued their scor­
ing ways minutes later with an oppor­
tunity in the CMU offensive zone. Paul, 
falling down, still managed to handle 
the puck and send it towards Ardire 
right in front of the net. But Ardire, 
knowing that junior defenseman Dave 
Mitzel was right behind him, dished it 
back to Mitzel who easily sunk the 
puck in the net.
CMU now lead 7-0 with five min­
utes left in the second period. The first 
line came out again and scored. 
Voulgaris dumped the puck towards 
the net and Buck picked it up on his 
back hand and scored his second of the

Carnegie Mellon’s swim teams have their last home meet this Friday; the teams are 
looking strong after their training over break.

Tartan Sports Editor
“It’s just a good situation,” men’s and 
women’s swimming and diving head 
coach David Belowich said of the team’s 
winter training at the Swimming Fo­
rum in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. “[I am] 
very pleased with the overall training, 
the physical part, the mental part. It 
goes past the physical,” Belowich said of 
the rigors of their training. “It delves 
into the mental.”
The team went to Florida mainly to 
train, but did compete in one meet at the 
Forum. Freshman Kara Cook placed 
secnd in the women’s Division III 100 
meter freestyle, while freshman Mike 
Robinson was also second in the same

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basket­
ball team competed well this past 
Wednesday at the Skibo Gymnasium 
against University of Pittsburgh- 
Greensburg. The team won 81-41 to 
even their season’s record at 7-7. In an 
outstanding performance, the team was 
full of energy and enthusiasm.
The Tartans took the lead in the first 
few minutes of the game and made their 
opponents fight for every point. The game 
showed the team at their very best. 
Freshman guard Sherry Cribbins scored 
three points for the team in the last 
second of the game, finishing the scoring 
with an exciting moment.
Every single player scored for the Tar­
tans. Senior guard Penny Davis led in scor­
ing with a team-high 20 points and was 
followed by freshman forward Samantha 
Majemjk with ten. Davis, Kristen Kupfer, 
RebeccaMcCadneyandKellyGaitfenshave 
been the top players andleaders of the team 
since 1993. Davis is the team caprain this 
year for the second time. She is a remark­
able player, one of the top in UAA, averag­
ing 10.6 points per game last season. Team­
mate Kristin Kupfer, another top 
UAA player, is a superior defensive 
player, who also led the team last 
season with the highest point per 
game scoring (13.3).
Junior forward Katie 
O’Leary has also been one of 
team’s top players, starting 
every game and displaying a 
strong offensive game. The 
coaches point out that the 
team needs its freshmen this 
year, like Cribbins, to take over 
and keep the team going. An­
other one of the rookies this 
year, guard Lacey Perretta, 
played excellently, adding en­
ergy to the court and pushing 
her teammates.
The junior varsity squad also 
won on Wednesday against CCAC 
56-45, with Lindsay Smith scoring a high 
for the team of 15 points. Although they 
struggled the first half of the game, their 
recovery during the second half was star­
tling. “[It] was a tough game, but the 
team fought back [in the] second half,” 
said coach Gerri Seidl. Her assistants 
expressed semilar sentiments. Last 
weekend, the team lost one of its fresh-

NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 26 (AP) 
— The Vince Lombardi Trophy is 
heading home to the town 
Lombardi made famous.
The Green Bay Packers won 
their first world title since 
Lombardi left the franchise 29 
years ago, overcoming New En­
gland Patriots 35-21 in Super 
Bowl XXXI on Sunday.
The Packers won their third 
Super Bowl with record perfor­
mances in all phases of the again.
MVP Desmond Howard re­
turned a third-quarter kickoff 99 
yards for a crucial touchdown that 
put Green Bay comfortably back 
in front after the Patriots had 
pulled to 27-21. Howard, the first 
special teams player ever to win 
MVP, finished with 244 total re­
turns, also a Super Bowl record.
Brett Favre threw two touch­
down passes and ran for another. 
His first pass went for a 54-yard 
score to, and his second TD strike 
was an 81-yard bomb to, also a 
Super Bowl record.
On defense, the Pack racked up 
four interceptions off New En­
gland quarterback Drew Bledsoe, 
and defensive end Reggie White, 
the NFL’s all-time sack leaders, 
collected a record three sacks.
The victory was the 13th 
straight for an NFC team and 
kept Bill Parcells, who had two of 
those 13 with the Giants in 1986 
and 1990, from becoming the first 
coach to win a Super Bowl with 
two different franchises.
Instead, the Packers won the 
trophy named for their storied 
coach. It was Lombardi’s teams 
that won the first two Super 
Bowls.
‘‘Vince Lombardi had a won­
derful legacy for the rest of us. 
Now we’re just trying to do our 
part, and we hope we can do it for 
a long time to come,” Packers 
coach Mike Holmgren said.
The game began like it would 
be a Packers’ blowout.
First there was the TD pass to 
Rison from Favre, who finished 
14 of 27 for 246 yards. It was 10-
0 just 6:25 into the game after 
Doug Evans’ interception set up 
Chris Jacke’s 31-yard field goal.
But by the end of the highest- 
scoring first quarter in Super 
Bowl history, New England led 
14-10 on TD passes by Bledsoe of
1 yard to Keith Byars and 4 yards 
to Ben Coates.
And even after a 17-point sec­
ond quarter by the Packers that 
included the 81-yard bomb to 
- v. >,
Freeman and 2-yard TD run by 
Favre, New England was still in 
it at 27-14 at the half.
And when Ted Johnson stopped 
Dorsey Levens for a 7-yard loss on 
fourth-and-1 at the Pats 37 on the 
first drive of the fourth quarter, 
New England gained momentum.
They cut it to 27-21 on Curtis 
Martin’s 18-yard burst up the 
middle with 3:27 left in the third 
quarter.
But Howard took the ensuing 
kickoff, burst up the middle and 
went nearly untouched to the end 
zone. Then Favre Mark Chmura 
in the back of the end zone for a 
two-point conversion to give the 
Packers a 14-point lead.
Bledsoe tried to rally the Patriots 
in the fourth quarter, but could not.

going 25 of 48 for 253 yards.

Students can turn to administrati
Administrators offer support
By SUSAN WATSON
fartan Senior Staffwriter 
& ANNE RAY
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
From an office in Warner Hall that overlooks 
Morewood Gardens and the University Center, Paul 
Fowler, associate dean of Student Affairs, reviews 
lists of student projects and problems that require 
his attention, from helping students manage time, 
to getting buses for the hockey team, and hiring a new bagpipe 
director. Every day, Fowler, like other administrators, tackles 
issues pertinent to students and the rest of the University.
“My primary job description is to provide direct support 
and assistance to students, “ said Fowler. “For example, 
this week alone I’ve had two students who have needed 
some short-term disability assistance [because of inju­
ries]. One needed a physical room change, and the 
other needed help getting to and from campus.”
He meets daily with representatives from stu- 
dent-run organizations and assists in meeting 
their needs. Fowler is involved in the direction 
of many projects that are meant to help stu­
dents, like the newly-formed First-Year 
Council and the First-Year Partnership pro­
gram. Fowler recently planned an informa­
tion session about the drug Rohypnol, com­
monly known as “roofies.” Other problems 
he plans to handle are the organization of 
the honors and awards that are printed in 
the program at each year’s commencement, 
and the coordination of the first day of 
5 at CMU, from parking, to recycling,
[and the grounds crew.
Fowler, and Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy, emphasize that students should not 
hesitate to come to administrators with problems 
they feel they can help resolve, or when they have no 
other ideas of where to go. Though students may be 
hesitant to consult administrators when they have 
an important issue or problem, administration urges 
everyone to contact them when they need assistance.
Murphy believes that both students and faculty 
should take advantage of the opportunity to consult 
one another. “I think student-administrator commu­
nication is best built on the same foundation as any 
other relationship: mutual respect, integrity and 
shared purpose,” Murphy said. “I think students here 
have a great track record in each of these areas. The 
most significant impediment, of course, is lack of 
contact. Students need to seek out and embrace 
opportunities to contribute, and administrators need 
to ensure that they are approachable and accessible.”
Fowler’s accessibility is one part of his job descrip-
know that they have 
a contact just by 
their residential 
status.”
One position 
that exists in almost every university, including 
CMU, that deals less with students on a indi­
vidual level is the Provost.
“Officially [the proyost]'is referred to as the chief 
academic office because the provost handles all the 
______ academic issue. InAssociate Provost helps students
“Students need to seek out... opportuni- “SSX
ties to contribute, and administrators need Acuity typically7 belong to depart-to ensure that they are approachable ... ** ments that areheaded up by de-— Michael Murphy; partment heads,

tion. “I would say 30 percent ofmy time in the office, Paul Christiano. “There’s a certain number of 
minimally, is spent in direct one-on-one contact routine things such as meeting with deans indi- 
pvith students,” said Fowler. “I guess the question is vidually or collectively to discuss or [propose] ideas 
when should a student not come to me. I would say that the administration should try to help gain 
that for just general student needs, students need to some progress on, such as the creation of a new
research center,” he said.
There are four Vice Provosts, 
each in charge of a different de­
partment: Edmond Ko, vice pro­
vost for Education, Duane 
Adams, vice provost for Re­
search, Alex Hills, vice provost 
for Computing Services, and 
Howard Wactlar, vice provost 
for Research Computing.
Ko realizes that “provost” is a 
vague term that many students 
might not understand. “A [pro­
vost] assists the president. To push 
the analogy... the president is the 
chief executive officer and the pro­
vost is the chief operating officer.” 
With the help of CMLTs adminis­
tration, students have been able to 
begin a number of new activities on 
campus that effect the entire com­
munity. “Our students aresobright, 
and so thoughtful in their assess­
ment of potential enhancements to 
campus,” said Murphy. “Tlieir im­
pressions and suggestions are the 
drivingforceinmuchofwhatwe do. 
There are so many examples of 
positive outcomes, from very per­
sonal studenttriumphs to suchcam- 
pus-wide initiatives as the Fifth- 
Year scholar program, the Fiesta

rum, Winter Orientation, the

Barbara Lazarus serves as a link between the CMU administration and students when issues arise.
By ENA KHAN
Tartan News Editor
With a great deal of responsibilities, ranging 
from creating policies to supervising commit­
tees, Barbara Lazarus makes one thing clear — 
the students are her primary concern.
As the Associate Provost for Academic Projects, 
Lazarus acts as a liaison between the adminis­
tration and students on issues concerning aca­
demic policies. On a weekly basis, Lazarus at­
tempts to strengthen the administration's link 
with students by helping them understand the 
academic policies created by the administration. 
“Partly because of my job and because I work 
with the Provost, five to six times a week 111 get 
a call from a student who has a concern,” said 
Lazarus. Her concern for the well-being of stu­
dents emerges during these weekly meetings 
when Lazarus gets to the individuals on a per­
sonal level. WA lot of the students I work with 
because they have a problem [sic]. We end up just 
talking about anything,” she said.
“It’s very comfortable talking with her even 
though she is a member of the administration,” 
said Katya Strinka, a senior double major in civil 
engineering and engineering and public policy 
and special projects assistant.
As Associate Provost for Academic Projects, 
Lazarus is responsible for various committees 
and councils that develop academic policies and 
procedures. Lazarus helps determine “which 
policies should be consistent throughout the Uni­
versity,” she said. In the past she has worked on 
issues such as grievance procedures, pass/fail 
policy,: rules for transferring colleges, and poli­
cies for taking a leave of absence.
“Largely what we are concerned about is mak­
ing the rules clear to students. If a student feels 
he or she has been slighted by the University, 
there is someone to help [them],” said Lazarus.
Previously, the pass/fail policy required that 
each student get permission from the instructor, i 
Now the policy has been changed so the instruc­
tor does not know if the student is taking the

Life After College. The Art of Empow­
erment. The Beauty of Organization. 
CMITs fifth annual Winter Orientation, 
held this past weekend, covered these 
topics and others, as participants were 
given the chance to interact with faculty 
and staff while working towards achiev­
ing their own successes.
“Strategies for Success” was the theme 
for this year’s Orientation conference. 
“The goal of Winter Orientation is to 
recharge students and give them valu­
able survival skills and a positive out­
look on the upcoming semester,” said 
Darren Mauro, a junior computer sci­
ence major and former Head Orienta­
tion Counselor who helped with regis­
tration at this year’s orientation.
“People come back to school ready to 
tackle next semester, and [orienta­
tion] is a good way to begin the pro­
cess of taking the semester on and 
starting off fresh,” said Kimberly 
DiDonato, coordinator of Student Life 
for First-Year programs and director 
of Winter Orientation.
Directors DiDonato and Mary Hoover, 
coordinator of Student Life for Scholar­
ship and Family Life, worked with a 
committee of five students to plan the 
event. “We had the largest turnout ever,” 
said Christina Lopez, student assistant 
to the directors of Winter Orientation.
According to DiDonato, approximately 
450 people registered for this year’s con­
ference, a significant increase from last 
year. “Moving to the University Center 
allowed the program to expand and bet-

A representative of Anderson Consulting spoke to students during Winter Orientation,

Mauro.
This year’s Orientation began with 
the keynote address, entitled “What is 
Success and How Do We Measure It?” 
presented by Evelyn Pierce, adjunct pro­
fessor in the Graduate School of Indus­
trial Administration. “It’s always great 
when such a talented presenter comes 
out of the classroom to share her skill in 
a program like Winter Orientation,” said 
Mauro. DiDonato said, “[Pierce] shared 
personal experiences and gave advice in 
a positive and uplifting speech. It was a 
good tone-setter for the day.”
The conference also featured several 
workshops aimed at providing an oppor­
tunity for students to adopt specific skills
to enhance their academic and personal 
success while in school. Christina 
Padour, a sophomore mechanical engi- 
neering major, attended and enjoyed 
“Success through Structure: The Beauty 
of Organization,” presented by Allison 
Riley, assistant director of Student Life, 
and Roxanne Bogo, coordinator of Stu­
dent Life. According to Padour, the work­
shop was beneficial because it was open 
and individualized, as students worked 
in groups and wrote things down about 
their personal schedules. “It was very 
motivating,” said Padour.

“Has anyone here seen my friend Martin? Can 
you tell me where he’s gone? I looked around one 
day, but he was gone. Has anyone seen my 
friend Martin Luther King, Jr.?” said Debora 
Johnson-Seabrook, a speaker at the Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Day celebration held at CMU 
last Monday. Over a hun­
dred students, faculty, and 
visitors attended the cel­
ebration, crowding into the 
Adamson Wing to observe 
the ceremony and to par­
ticipate in the reception held 
afterwards.
The celebration revolved 
around the theme “Make Real 
the Dream, Frame the Vision 
For the 21st Century.”
The speakers in the cer­
emony gave reflections on the 
life and person of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., what his 
dreams were, and how his 
hopes can be realized as the 
new millennium approaches.
“ ‘Make real the dream, 
frame the vision.’ Dr. King’s 
words are worth repeating 
primarily because they are 
still valid and still need to be heard as much 
[today] as they were three decades ago,” said 
Reverend Dr. Harold T. Lewis, the keynote 
speaker.
The ceremony began with a welcoming speech by 
Everett Tademy, director of the Equal Opportu­
nity Programs at CMU, an invocation by Dawn 
Lynn Check, the interim executive director of the 
United Campus Ministry of Pittsburgh.
Dr. William Elliot, vice president for Enroll­
ment at CMU, gave opening remarks about King’s 
education and college experiences.
Elliot explained how King’s college experiences 
were comparable with a curriculum a student 
might have today. “The important issue is the 
fact that, and I think obviously, undergraduate 
experience had a profound effect on this man

“The first word and probably the 
only word that is synonymous with 
dress in the corporate setting is con­
servative,” said Lisa Sabatelli of Ad­
vanced Information Systems at last 
Monday’s “Dress for Success” program. 
The program, organized by the Career 
Center’s Beth Miller and Kathryn 
Hoover, a senior En­
glish major, was 
held in the UC Ball­
room last Monday 
evening from 5:30 
pm to 7 pm.
The program was 
organized in the 
hopes of giving stu­
dents a better idea 
of how to prepare for 
an interview and to 
dress approprately in a variety of set­
tings. Sabatelli’s statement verbalized 
a strong trend of convention that was 
evident in the suggestions of all the 
various parties represented. Their ad­
vice on the appropriate attire for dif­
ferent business settings, especially job 
interviews, was to remain conserva­
tive. “I think you can get that extra 
confidence edge by knowing you’re 
dressed appropriately,” said Ingrid 
Hultgren, a junior design major, on 
why she attended the presentation.
“You have an oppor­
tunity to represent who 
you are before you open 
your mouth,” said pan­
elist Marsha Lewis, of 
Allegheny County CYS.
“You represent you, and 
that’s critical.”
“Business in general 
is very conservative,” 
said Sabatelli, “The 
overallappearance 
should be very crisp, 
very neat, and very con­
servative,” she said.
Mary Jean Spencer of 
Forbes Hospice, and 
Cindy Zibrida of Pitts­
burgh Cultural Trust 
also added their com­
ments about work attire, 
which were somewhat 
less strict since both 
work for non-profit or­
ganizations.
Among the companies 
represented were Talbots 
and Kountz & Rider, 
which each contributed 
clothing samples, as well 
as Forbes Hospice, Ad­
vanced Information Sys­
tems, Pittsburgh Cultural
Trust, and Allegheny County CYS, the 
representatives of which made up a four- 
personpanel to commenton the samples.
Maria Janik of Talbots kicked off 
the program by displaying the appro­
priate attire for women in various busi­
nesses, including government, com­
munication, corporate, non-profit, and 
arts and entertainment. “Dressing for 
success is a very important catch term,” 
said Janik. Her main advice was to
concentrate on four basic elements: 
fit, comfort, appropriateness, practi­
cality, and season. Nearly all of what 
was shown were simple, but expen­
sive suits in solid colors.
Following Janik’s presentation was 
a similar display of men’s clothing 
shown by Frank Zimmerman ofKountz 
& Rider. “The biggest change in the 
late ’80s and ’90s ... is fit. In the busi­
ness world a suit should fit like a gar­
ment. It says something for yourself,”

sity,” Gangewere said.
Although the course deals mostly 
with magazine writing, there is a strong 
emphasis on the technological aspect 
of publication. The project was prima­
rily designed to give the students a 
chance to be published, but it was also 
an experiment in this new type of on­
line media.
One advantage that on-line maga­
zines have over published 
magazines is that it is much 
cheaper and easier, to get 
them published, according to 
Petrozinni. This means that 
anybody who might want to 
publish something now has 
a much better chance.
Gangewere hopes that 
Zine375 will be the first step 
towards a tradition of publishing his 
students’ works on-line. Unfortunately, 
Magazine Writing is not offered in the 
spring, so the next issue will not come 
out until the fall.

“At first we wanted to publish only the 
good articles, but when the students 
started handing their articles in, they 
were all good. So we allowed each stu­
dent to publish at least one article,” said

CMU students would 
like to see set by the new

Last September, a few

the lack of student interest.

The Player’s Manual
by Amit N. Kar
Mateo is a great guy. 
He’s my oldest friend, 
and being an Aussie, 
he can’t help but be 
cool. While I consider 
us to be equals in 
almost every re­
spect (we’re both 
Scorpios, which 
makes us better 
than ll/12ths 
of the world), he 
has one thing I 
don’t and for 
that, he has my 
unconditional 
respect. The boy 
has guts.
One day to­
wards the end of 
our third semes­
ter in college,
Mateo called me 
from Arizona 
State where he 
was studying fine 
arts. I thought it 
was going to be a 
short, “see you 
soon” conversation.
“Hey Babu,” (he 
calls me Babu). “ Just 
thought I’d call to tell 
you I’m quitting col­
lege and after Christ­
mas break, I’m going 
to apply to the 
Musician’s Institute 
in London to study 
electric bass, and
while I’m studying there, I’m going to 
work as a cocktail waiter. See you soon.” 
I analyzed this for a moment and re­
sponded, (rather cleverly I thought),
“Uhhhhh.......”
At first I thought he was taking the 
easy way out.
We both had the same pressures to 
deal with; the need to succeed, the need
to take care of the fam- ____________
ily in the future, the need 
to earn respect and ap­
proval. While I kow­
towed to my family and 
social norms, he 
just decided he’d 
do what he 
wanted. Now 
he’s finding 
strength and 
direction as a 
struggling musician in Lon­
don while I’m wondering 
why I spent the last seven 
semesters taking classes I 
found as appealing as wip­
ing my butt with sandpa­
per.
The answer is that I was 
a coward.
There are so many ex­
pectations on the 
soon-to-be gradu­
ate, especially for 
those matriculat­
ing from a career- 
focused institu­
tion like ours; a 
cushy job with the 
prospect of a company- 
subsidized MBA in two or 
three years, a Doctorate some­
where before the paunch becomes 
noticeable, a three-bedroom house 
in suburbia, 2.1 kids, a Volvo, and 
a Labrador. Needs as basic as self- 
fulfillment, adventure, and testing 
the limits of youthful vigor are 
sacrificed in favor of risk reduction 
and acceptance by an intellectually 
complacent society.
Many students find

verge of graduation as confused about 
what they want to do for a living as 
when they first registered for classes. 
It’s true that much of this uncertainty 
comes from not knowing what else is 
available, but a lot of it also comes 
from being too afraid to do what you 
want. From a young age we are qui­
etly told that doing things too differ-

ently increases the risk of failure. Ac­
tually, history is replete with stories 
of people whose decision to be unor­
thodox protected them from vanish­
ing into obscurity and mediocrity — 
Bill Gates, Abraham Lincoln, Richard 
Branson, Mother Theresa, Mahatma 
Gandhi, Marie Curie — this list could 
go on forever.
I was pleased to learn that youthful 
invincibility is not dead at CMU. Re­
cently a bunch of friends who could 
have named their price at Microsoft 
or Intel chose instead to join a small 
start-up firm that may not even exist 
in a year. What better time to take the 
path less traveled than right after 
graduation, when you’re still young 
and indestructible, and don’t have dia­
pers to change ? What better time to 
put it all on the line and go for what 
you want ?
The lesson is painfully simple and 
that may be why so many people miss it: 
you’re almost guaranteed to succeed 
when you do things on your own terms. 
It just takes some guts.

attire, the men’s was equally tradi­

neckware, shirts, and socks to help 
pick up outfits a bit. “A tie isn’t going to 
make or break you, but it can certainly 
add to a conservative suit,” he said.
All of the panelists' stressed the 
importance of taking the actual job 
setting into consideration even be­
fore the interview. “I thought the

clared freshman in Humanities and

Program honors teachings of Martin Luther King, Jr.
MLK, from page L2
Seabrook, a master’s student in pub­
lic policy and management, related the 
life and accomplishments of King. “I’d 
like to think of him as chosen, not self- 
selected; It was Martin’s character that 
drove him to importance,” said Seabrook 
as she described King’s character and 
commitments.
The keynote address, given by Lewis, 
reflected the current condition of 
King’s dream, and pointed directions 
for the realization of racial harmony 
and equality. “If King could visit Pitts­
burgh today, he would have been dis­
heartened, but not shocked by the 
statistics recently published by the 
Center for Social and Urban Research 
at the University of Pittsburgh.” 
Lewis pointed out that of 15 large

has the highest percentage 
of adult black males not in

cent; the highest poverty 
rate for blacks, ages 18 to 
64, at 35 percent; and the 
second highest percentage 
of black children in poverty, 
at 56 percent. “The dream 
must be made real lest it 
becomes a nightmare,” said 
Dr. Lewis.
Lewis said that the solution 
lies in gaining clarity and di­
rection for the vision.
‘“Framing the vision’ is a 
well- chosen phrase. It sug­
gests parameters, limits, a 
specificity to our vision. The
idea seems to be a corrective against 
wild-eyed ideas and purposeless 
meanderings of the mind,” said Lewis.
The committee of organizers for the 
event began planning for the celebra-
ebration.

Columnist considers travel, study abroad as a U.S. minority
Facing Race and Culture
by Shannon Gibney
Upon leaving for my semester 
study abroad in Bolivia, I reflected 
upon how I would finally be in a 
place where race was not viewed 
as the most important aspect of 
my person. I envisioned myself 
among a community of mixed 
people who would not see me as a 
racial and cultural anomaly, con­
stantly pulling at my hair as if I 
were a doll. However, once in­
country, people still yanked at 
my hair and stared at me in the 
streets. There was no way to dis­
guise who I was — a light-brown 
gringa who spoke bad Spanish.
And the fact that people didn’t 
focus on my race — that they 
grouped me into the same cat­
egory as the rest of the white kids 
on my program bothered me. I 
wanted to say, “Wait! I’m differ­
ent!” But the truth was, Bolivia 
equalized all of us as gringos. 
And I could not stand it.
Now that I’m back in the States, 
I can see that I had to go abroad 
to realize the amount to which 
my own identity is based upon 
others’ perception of me as a black 
woman and the presence of our 
own particular type of racism 
here. Without personal and com­
munity assumptions to rely on, I 
did not know who I was nor who 
I should have been in Bolivia.
Though these situations and 
issues are not specific to U.S. 
minority students, I know now 
that my identity as such in Bo­
livia marked my experience dif­
ferently than those of my white 
peers. There are certain situa­
tions that U.S. minorities may
encounter in another country that 
white students may not, simply 
because of their race (or because 
of their race and their sex).
For starters (and most black, 
hispanic or Native American stu­
dents at CMU will already be 
used to this), the U.S. minority 
student may be the only other 
“person of color” on their pro­
gram. I was the only “person of 
color” on my program and conse­
quently became frustrated dur­
ing many class and individual 
conversations. I felt that no one 
could nor wanted to understand 
my perspective. This became ex­
tremely problematic when we 
were discussing “U.S. Life and 
Reality” with other Bolivians; 
there were many times when I 
wondered if I lived in the same 
country as my peers.
Having talked to some friends 
who also studied abroad, I realize 
that the isolation I sometimes 
felt in the student group was not 
singular. “I remember a girl from

Hutchinson, a 
senior IM and

jor, said that her 
experience in' 
Monterrey, Mexico 
last semester was 
greatly affectedby her 
status as a black 
woman. Hutchinson 
was often called “la 
morena,” or‘la chocolita” 
and many Mexicans 
went out of their way to 
touch her skin or hair. 
Hutchinson said that for 
her, the constant atten­
tion was annoying and 
unwanted but that she 
had another black friend 
whoreallyenjoyedher“ce-

Iroro Fred Orife, a se­
nior in electrical and

possible. He said, “[It] is 
the most rewarding aca­
demic experience one can

ate level.”
If current statistics hold 
steady or fall, however, 
Orife’s exhortation 
may effectively fall 
on deaf ears. The 
Institute of In-

Education con­
ducted a sur­
vey in 1994-

that .84 per­
cent of the 76,000 
U.S. stu dents who 
studied abroad 
were white, 5 per- 
. cent were Latino or 
- / Asian American and 
that African Ameri­
cans and Native 
Americans consti­
tuted only 2.8 percent 
and 0.3 percent, re­
spectively. Many institutions say 
that the number of non-white stu­
dents studying abroad is too small 
to document. CMU is no excep­
tion, as only aroundl'O student« 
participated in such programs last 
semester. Eva Mergner, study 
abroad advisor in the Office of 
International Education said, 
“There are grants specific to mi- 
norities and certainly they are 
recruited actively.... We could do a 
lot more here at CMU.”
For many U.S. minority stu­
dents, myself included, decid­
ing whether to study abroad, 
where, through what program 
and how can be very difficult. 
There are a myriad of economic, 
social and cultural factors to 
consider that are no less diffi­
cult for white students to con­
tend with, but nonetheless 
largely different for students 
from U.S. minority groups. How­
ever, the challenge that experi­
encing and exploring yourseli 
in another culture poses is one 
that should not be missed by 
anyone — especially minority 
students. Who knows? Maybe, 
like me, you will retur-n from 
the ends of the Earth knowing 
for the first time what it means 
to you to. be black, Native- 
American, Asian or hispanic, 
rather than what it means to 
the limited range of people in 
your immediate environment. 
And what, after all, could be 
more valuable than this?

has been my experience that student 
opinion is usually listened to and consid- 
eredby the administration,” stated Krug.
At the same time, Slye noted that on 
occasion there has been a disagreement 
between the two groups and financial

address them in the most visionary light

neering major Kimberly Wilson, another 
member of the group. “I encourage students 
to read the [Student 
Perspective]. We want 
to reinforce the com­
munication channelbe- 
tween stuients and ad­
ministration so the 
proper action can be 
taken to address some 
of these issues,” said

Some ofthe most recurrent and press­
ing issues that were acknowledged in 
the committee’s book were the need for 
more student interaction with the fac­
ulty and the new President, a better 
reputation for the university, the role of 
the HUB, the need for more career op­
portunities for non-technical graduates, 
and the quality of life at CMU.
Presently, the Presidential Search 
Committee, which includes the Board of 
Trustees and the Faculty Search Com­
mittee is narrowing down the list of 
candidates. Once this is done, the Stu­
dent Liasion Committee plans to be in­
volved with the formal interview pro­
cess. “Right now we are waiting for feed­
back from the students. We hope to hear

Sexual Assault advisors network, and the

Students also go to administrators 
when they have problems. Jason 
Siegendorf, a junior electrical and com­
puter engineering major, dealt with such 
a situation whenhe approached Murphy 
with a concern regarding freshmen fra­
ternity pledges. “The problem was that 
freshmen ... [who] wanted to switch to 
the fraternity meal plan were getting 
cheated because they had to have a 
certain minimum meal plan with din­
ing services,” said Siegendorf. “I went to 
Dean Murphy representing the frater­
nities, and negotiated a better meal 
plan for pledges that would not cheat 
them. After that, he convinced [Dining 
Services] to allow the pledges to use the 
plan I negotiated.”
If students face difficulty in resolv­
ing their problems, Murphy insists 
that administration will do what they 
can so that both students and admin­
istration reach a common ground.
“Most often, when students are not 
happy, it has been because they perceive 
an unwillingness on the part of the ad­
ministrator to help. Helping to make the

that student opinion is usually

personal contact between the players in­
volved is usually the best solution,” he said.
“Students shouldn’t be afraid to meet 
with Dean Murphy,” said Siegendorf. 
“In my case, he was positive and willing 
to help. He got us what we wanted.”
At the same time, both Murphy and 
Siegendorf believe that student and admin­
istration communication can be improved. “I 
think a great way to make communication 
betteristohaveopenfonnns.”saidSiegendorf: 
Melissa Licht, a freshman mathemat­
ics major, thinks that most students 
would never have a rekson to contact an 
administrator in Warner Hall, and that 
many would use more local means of 
solving problems.
“I think if I had a big enough problem I 
would go to an administrator, but Tve never 
felt the need. We’d go through an RA first, 
and they’d go higher up, [sic]” said licht. “I 
don’t even know what [the President] looks 
like or where his office is. I just remember 
him talking to us at Orientation. “ 
Christiano said that he doesn’t come 
in to meet personally with students very 
often because most students don’t think 
to use the upper echelon of the adminis­
tration as a resource. “As you know, 
students belong to academic units, and
therefore most of the things that are 
handled more locally,” he said. “To tell 
you the truth, it’s up to the students if 
they believe there isn’t enough contact 
[between students and administra­
tors]. That’s something we can work 
on. I think students have an awful lot 
to do and they know when they have a 
problem and who they need to see.... I 
like to talk to students, but I don’t 
want to waste their time. If the stu­
dents don’t believe that their concerns 
are being addressed in the usual chan­
nels ... then of course we can try to 
correct that. It’s not an issue of not 
wanting to have as much dialog... but 
I do believe you can overdo it,” said 
Christiano.”
“The key is openness and access,” 
said Murphy. “I think both students 
and administrators need to work to 
make sure that communication is as 
frequent as possible. For administra­
tors, in particular, this means getting 
out and talking with students, making 
sure students know that feedback is 
desired and will be used,” said Murphy.

drawback. “Gathering opinions of stu­
dents and making revisions of the book­
let took a lot of time,” he said. “It’s really 
great to have the opportunity to be in­
volved in a process like this, that will 
have an impact on what happens at 
CMU for the next five or ten years.”
“The most important thing is that this 
process helps us put things in perspec­
tive. You get the opportunity to recognize 
the breadth of issues facing CMU stu­
dents. More importantly, the [Student 
Perspective], which was a result of this 
process, helped articulate the direction 
in which students would like to see the 
university progress,” said Shankavaram.

absence, students previously were not 
able to go to school anywhere else.
Lazarus helped “rewrite the policy so 
it would appreciate the fact that stu­
dents need to leave. We needed to make 
it friendlier,” she said. The need to make 
changes in specific old policies becomes 
obvious for Lazarus in speaking with 
students. She is aware of the policies 
that students have trouble with because 
she speaks with them first-hand to find 
out about their problems.
Along with maintaining policies, the 
office of the Associate Provost is respon­
sible for recruiting funding from various 
sources to offer student fellowships, 
scholarships, and internship opportuni­
ties. Lazarus also serves as the faculty 
liaison for the Fulbright Scholarship and 
chairs selection committees for the 
Carnegie Scholars program and other
University awards. Lazarus is respon­
sible for the Intercultural Communica­
tions Center (ICC), Special Projects Of­
fice (SPO), and the Undergraduate Re­
search Initiative. ICC trains interna­
tional students to succeed in their aca­
demic programs as well as prepare in­
ternational TAs to teach in the Ameri­
can classroom. The program allows stu­
dents to “understand something about 
teaching in the American Context,” ac­
cording to Lazarus. SPO provides aca­
demic programs to support graduate stu­
dents, especially those of color and 
women in the sciences and technical 
fields. The Undergraduate Initiative 
encourages students to become involved 
in the research process. These programs 
are yet another way for Lazarus and the 
administration to interact with students.

cussed with students methods 
of identifying stressful patterns 
in one’s academic life and strat­
egies for remaining motivated. 
Mauro said, “He’s always a gifted 
and entertaining speaker, and I 
think a number of students 
gleaned valuable guidance from 
the presentation.”
“Many people think [orienta­
tion] is entirely for first-year 
students, but actually many of 
the sessions are worthwhile for 
students of any age,” said 
Mauro. “The attendance by 
sophomores, juniors, and se­
niors reflected that upperclass­
men are beginning to realize 
how worthwhile Winter Orien­
tation can be.” Anoop Shah, a 
sophomore biology major, did 
not attend orientation last year 
as a freshman, but decided to 
go this year. “It was recom­
mended by a lot of people from 
last year,” he said.
“Life After College,” pre­
sented by Mona Singhvi, ca­
reer consultant in the Career 
Center, was an informal and 
discussion-oriented workshop 
covering resume writing, 
graduate schools and applica­
tions, and internships. “Wher­
ever you are in the process, it 
is never too late to start, 
whether you are a freshman 
°r upperclassman,” said Ac­
cording to Singhvi.
“Get Out of the Classroom,” fea­
tured representatives from IBM, 
Anderson Consulting, and Proc­
tor & Gamble, who told the audi­
ence how essential it is to get 
involved in extracurricular ac­
tivities, according to Jishnu 
Guha, a freshman industrial 
Management major. “They told 
us how they help develop prob­
lem solving, organizational and 
leadership skills. It was very in­
formative.”
Overall, this year’s winter ori­
entation was a great success, 
especially due to the number of

people who were involved and 
who volunteered to help out, 
according to Andrew Snyder, a 
sophomore computer science 
and math major and Head Ori­
entation Counselor for next fall. 
“The associate deans, Student 
Activities, and Student Affairs 
all played a major role,” said 
Lopez. “Everyone from the Stu­
dent Life Office was immensely 
helpful in pulling the program 
off. The Resident Assistants 
and Community Advisors 
helped with getting people to 
the program, and many of the
OCs and the head OCs helped 
with registration both during 
the week and the day of winter 
orientation.”
“This was my first year work­
ing with the program, and we 
are very excited about how it 
turned out,” said Hoover. “[Ori­
entation] seems to be meeting 
a need on campus. Since ... 
many students come, it is meet­
ing the needs of the population, 
and we are going to keep doing 
it. Hopefully it will only get 
bigger and better every year,”

Pittsburgh lacks options 
for young dancers
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Diversions Editor
You are under the age of 21 and want to go 
dancing in Pittsburgh ... hmmm... You could go to 
Mother fraternity party, but want you really want 
is to get off campus and mingle with some different 
folks — folks who don’t exchange email addresses 
'on the dance floor.
There was a time in Pittsburgh when fake IDs 
Were easy to come by and most bars were not strict 
about checking IDs, real or not. Now bars and clubs 
are more conscientious about who they let in, 
especially after recent crackdowns on local bars 
popular with college students. But drinking alco­
hol is not the point behind going out to clubs. Strict 
plcohol regulations make it difficult for anyone 
under 21 to go out dancing and mingling in the city.
3 a whole, Pittsburgh has some decent clubs. 
Peter Moore, a senior BHA major, hasn’t visited 
®any of the clubs in Pittsburgh, but says, “a lot of
people in region say there are some good clubs in 
Pittsburgh. ” He knows people as far away as north­
ern Virginia who have heard of Metropol, a club in 
the Strip District. Unfortunately, clubs such as 
Metropol aren’t open to the under-21 crowd; they 
only allow youngsters in for all-ages concerts.
Two clubs in Oakland cater specifically to the 
under-21 age group. Club Stratus and Laga, lo­
cated only about a block apart on Forbes Avenue, 
are open to anyone over the age of 18. Both clubs 
card at the door and distinguish between those 
over and under 21 with wristbands which allows 
those people to drink. Be prepared to pay more if 
you are under age — the cover charge is higher if 
you are not able to buy alcohol from the club.
Club Stratus is open Thursday through Sunday 
evenings and usually gives each night some corny 
name like “Red Dog/ HotdogNight” or “Toga Party.” 
The crowd seems young, some seem much younger 
than the required age of 18. Chris Weller, a sopho-

“Dancing is about movement, physicality, per­
formance. There is a voyeuristic ambiguity to danc­
ing in a darkened club, a tension between viewing 
others and being viewed, between extroversion 
and the illusion of anonymity,” says Paul 
Rosenblatt. Rosenblatt, associate professor of Ar­
chitecture at CMU, is the architect of the newly 
opened Laga nightclub, one of the few all-ages 
dance clubs in the Pittsburgh area. Located in 
Oaldand above The At­
tic, Laga proves itself 
worthy in both design 
and function. The 8,000- 
square-foot interior in­
cludes plenty of dancing 
space, a platform for live 
performances, a275-gal­
lon tropical fish tank, an 
over 21-drinking area, 
and a lounge.
Open Wednesdays 
through Saturdays from 
10 pm to 2 am, the club 
caters to both the under 
and over 21 crowds. Ron 
Levick, oWner of the 
club, wanted to create a 
place for all students to 
enjoy and says the mu­
sic varies each night.
“Wednesday is Goth/In­
dustrial, Friday is catering to the rave scene, and 
Thursday and Saturday nights are catering to 
mainstream college students.” Music on these two 
nights include Old School/New School Dance and 
Disco.
Matt McKeon, junior computer science major,
said, “I try to hit Laga on Wednesday nights foii 
their weekly Goth/Industrial dance night. The club' 
itself is beautiful, spacious, and well laid out, the 
promos are great, and the couches are comfy.” He 
added, “You get both the under-21 crowd, who are 
relieved to finally have a decent hangout, and the 
over-21 crowd, who are relieved that they can 
finally go to a club without leaving their under-21 
friends behind.” Said Kevin Meehan, senior En­
glish major, “The bar at Laga isn’t all that bad. 
Drinks are moderately priced and if there’s some­
thing they don’t have, you can go downstairs to The
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
Dancers groove to the music on a Saturday night at the recently opened Laga.
Attic and you’ll probably find it there.” [Ed. note: 
Kevin Meehan is the Dossier Literary Editor.] 
Cover charge is inexpensive and depends on the 
night. On Thursday through Saturday, the price is 
$4 before 11 pm and $6 after. Cover on Wednesday 
is $3 before 11 pm and $4 after. And Levick said, 
“For over 21, one price will get 
you into The Attic and Laga.” 
Levick plans to have bands per­
form at the club regularly. “I’m 
talking to promoters about hav­
ing all-ages shows. I see it hap­
pening every weekend. We also 
do a lot of fraternity and sorority 
parties.”
A decent club exists that can 
serve all college students. Dash 
Boyer-Olsen, sophomore indus­
trial management major, said of 
the new club, “Laga is pretty phat. 
I’ve been looking for a good place 
to go dancing and hey, I’ve found 
it.”
So don’t sit in your dorm room 
on weekend nights any longer. 
This all-ages dance club is defi­
nitely worth checking out.

Legendary punk band christens Club Laga’s stage
By BRADLEY 
ZIMMERMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
. Nashville has country, Seattle 
has grunge, D.C. has hardcore, 
and Pittsburgh has punk. Doubt 
it? You weren’t at Laga Satur­
day night, were you? The fledg­
ing dance club took a trial-by- 
fire with their first-ever live 
show, Iron City legend Anti- 
release party for their 
new CD Die For Your Govern­
ment.
Together for four years, Anti- 
Flag has been keeping the spirit 
°f TRUE punk burning bright, 
from their “question authority” 
stance, to their stripped-down 
poppy ’70s style music and no- 
friUs stage attire. Die For Your 
Government is a 17-track mon­
ster of pogo-happy antiestab-
shment tunes that glisten with
possibly the loudest production 
seen in the city. There’s no posing 
involved, no Pennywise-style gui­
tar noodling, and no faux-metal 
hardcore. Anti-Flag is nothing if 
not honest, and the recent depar­
ture of founding bassist/vocalist 
Andy Flag (who appears on the 
album) has been treated with the 
highest respect from the remain­
der of the band. Anti-Flag is real.
Before the doors even opened 
to the fourth-floor lair of Laga, 
the anxious line stretched down 
the stairs and into the street. It 
quickly became apparent that 
Laga is likely on par with Graffiti 
as far as capacity goes, for an 
estimated300-plus bodies packed 
together on the dancefloor with 
room to spare only in the adjoin­
ing side rooms.
The Kebabs opened the night 
with a somewhat Fugazi-tinged 
blend of sparse indie-punk and
Punk legends Anti-Flag released their new 
CD at Laga last Friday
received an appreciative welcome.
It was when Reagan Squad (pro­
moting their brilliant new 7-inch 
We'll Fight for What’s Right) took 
the stage that the crowd truly 
came to life. The young local 4-
piece, fronted by the 
charismatic Dan-Dan, 
pumped their stripped- 
down DC-style for an ex­
tended set and quickly 
had the pit rolling, often 
with more people on 
stage than band mem­
bers.
In between sets the 
punters were treated to 
a belly-dancing mooner 
and a kid who threaded 
a condom through his 
nose and out his mouth. 
Was this necessary? Eh, 
who cares.
There’s a saying that 
the difference between 
alternative and punk is 
that the former cries to “help the 
poor,” while punk screams “Kill 
the Rich.” Anti-Flag has a pres­
ence and a togetherness honed by 
their two national and three re­
gional tours that makes you won­
der why the hell the so-called 
‘punk’ bands on the radio aren’t 
opening for them. With a wall of 
energy and sound as thick as a 
concrete slab, Laga shook as the 
entire floor metamorphosized into 
a swirling mass of bouncing bod­
ies.
Never to be accused of preten­
tiousness, they brought the one 
and only Spaz (ofthe ‘zine P.M.SJ 
to dance in drag for “She’s My 
Little Go-Go Dancer.” The an­
them “You’ve Got to Die For the 
Government,” and crowd favor­
ite “Davey Destroyed the Punk 
Scene” incited more stage-diving 
and feats of daring-do than seen 
in local dives (likely due to the 
novelty of the four and a half­
foot stage/raised dancefloor). Hy­
peractive guitarist/vocalist Jus­
tin Sane introduced the tongue- 
in-cheek classic “Indie Sux,
Hardline sux, Emo Sux, You 
Suck” as “a song about us tak­
ing ourselves too seriously.” 
Strangely, the powers that be 
at Laga saw fit to test out their 
elaborate lighting system dur­
ing this song, throwing cheesy 
sunbursts and snowflake pat­
terns across the stage, which 
prompted drummer Pat Thetic 
to shout “Urn, you could kill the 
lights now....” As the set drew 
to a sweaty overdriven close, 
Sane’s voice gave out, so the 
crowd chimed in for entire 
songs.
And so ended the first trium­
phant Laga show. No injuries, 
no fights, just a show of Pitts­
burgh punk unity — the way 
Anti-Flag likes it. You may have 
missed it, but Die for Your Gov­
ernment is now available at the 
stores. Buy it, Pittsburgh was

scene in which Jackie fights a

he goes crazy on some guys while

Unfortunately, this film hits the; 
90-minute barrier hard. After a 
sensational (although implied), 
stunt, Jackie simply picks up the

all folks. This sudden ending was 
immediately glossed over by the

ways Jackie pummeled himself

Jackie Chan kicks big butt in new action film
play wows audiencePowerful
By MELISSA BATT
Tartan Staffwriter
Described as “powerful the­
ater” by The Daily News and by 
theNew Yorker as “emotionally 
brimming and alive with ten­
sion,” The Heiress, written by 
Ruth and Augustus Goetz and 
now showing at The Playhouse 
of Point Park College certainly 
lives up to these praises. Di­
rected by Larry John Meyers, 
this psychologically complex 
drama is phenomenally per­
formed by both professional and 
student cast members.
The play is set in the 1850s in 
the home of a wealthy widower 
and his socially awkward 
daughter, Catherine, who falls 
in love with a deceptive fortune 
seeker.
Catherine’s father, who de­
spises her for his wife’s death 
when giving birth to Catherine, 
forbids her marriage, suspect of 
the fiance’s motives, under the 
guise of protecting his daugh­
ter. Catherine, who hardens un­
der the mistreatment of both 
her father and her suitor over 
the years, relentlessly waits for 
her chance at revenge.
The original story, Washing­
ton Square by Henry James, as 
it was told by Frances Anne 
Kemble, a famous British ac­
tress in 1879. Seventy years 
later, Ruth and Augustus Goetz 
used the novel to create a Broad­
way play, The Heiress, which 
was followed by an Oscar-win­
ning movie version (Best Ac­
tress, Olivia De Havilland, and
Original Score, Aaron Copland), 
and a Tony award winning re­
vival in 1995. A new film adap­
tation from the novel is expected 
out this summer.
The Heiress called for many 
emotional and heart-wrenching 
scenes, which the cast delivered 
perfectly. Marie Elena O’Brien, 
as the jilted Catherine Sloper, 
and John Amplas, as her bitter 
father,portrayed their roles with 
tear-jerking flawlessness their 
respective roles, and created the 
chemistry between the father
and daughter to perfection. Also 
well-depicted was Marian Al­
mond, played by Brittney . K. 
Sweeney, the insouciant foil to 
Catherine, and Mrs. Lavinia 
Penniman, Catherine’s aunt 
played by Sheila McKenna.
The costumes, especially 
those of Catherine, in the play 
are incredibly detailed. Her 
wardrobe ranged from a cherry 
red dress to a beautiful french 
inspired dress with black lace.
The costumes of Dr. Sloper and 
the fortune hunter, Brett James 
Kennedy’s costumes were also 
detailed, right down to the 
pocket watch, hat and gloves.
An interesting touch is the 
design in which the scenes are 
changed, and how the furniture 
is rearranged within the Sloper 
household.
The servants appear as the 
lights dim to monotonously re­
arrange the scenery right be­
fore the audience’s eyes. The set 
includes a wide staircase, which
the characters use to its full 
potential, and a few interesting 
19th century pieces.
The Heiress will be playing 
at The Playhouse of Point Park 
College, located at 222 Craft 
Avenue, until February 9, 
Wednesday -Saturday at 8pm 
and Sundays at 2 pm. Tickets 
are available by calling (412) 
621-4445. Student discounts 
are available.
The cast of The Heiress shares a serious moment together.

Crucible does justice to original
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Something is rotten in the state of 
Massachusetts. No, Hamlet has not 
made a transatlantic voyage, but in­
stead Arthur Miller’s The Crucible 
has finally been adapted for the silver 
screen, by none other than Miller 
himself. As a whole, the movie is 
faithful to its source, with only minor 
changes where he was unsatisfied 
with his original. Despite this and a 
nearly flawless film, it didn’t make 
the impact I had expected.
What: The Crucible 
Director: Nicholas Hytner 
Company: 20thCentury Fox
The movie opens with a scene of 
Salem’s young women dancing in the 
forest around a bubbling kettle. The 
women have thrown charms into the 
pot in the hopes of attracting males 
from the village, and are enjoying a 
rare moment of freedom. This contin­
ues until the local reverend shows up 
and all the children promptly flee 
except Abigail Williams (Winona 
Ryder), his niece, and Betty Parris, 
his daughter. When Betty mysteri­
ously won’t wake up the next day, her 
father’s thoughts return to the syl­
van scene and Abigail. After a brief 
round of questioning, he announces 
to his parishioners that witchcraft is 
afoot in Salem and that he is bringing 
in an expert clergyman to deal with 
the situation.
As soon as the girls know that they 
may be punished for their dance in 
the forest, they start throwing out 
names of witches who coerced them to 
dance and commerce with Satan. As 
soon as the suspects are rounded up, 
the girls implicate more witches and 
mass hysteria begins. Anything sus­
picious from falling logs to flames is 
attributed to the Devil’s work, and
the townsfolk turn on one another. Not 
only that, but as the trials continue, the 
girls begin to believe in the spirits they 
have seen and become addicted to their 
power.
In a strong performance as the chief 
judge, Paul Scofield is ironically evil 
personified. There is something decid­
edly wrong with a man strongly con­
nected to his faith sending “witches” off 
to the gallows. By comparison, Winona 
Ryder is equally chilling in her desire to 
win the heart of John Proctor (Daniel 
Day-Lewis), her former employer. Natu­
rally, John’s wife is one of the accused. 
In the other two standout roles, Day- 
Lewis and Joan Allen play the Proctors, 
helped greatly by Miller’s script which 
is thick with quotes.
Thematically, The Crucible is no light­
weight either, as it operates on more 
than one level. There is a striking anal­
ogy to McCarthyism, in that the 
townsfolk are labeled as witches simply 
on the hearsay of a bunch of teenagers, 
and disastrous consequences are 
wrought forth.
In addition, there is a narrative about 
sexual repression beingreleased. Were 
it not for these feelings, there would 
have been no dance and no trials.
Complementing this weighty ma­
terial is a stunning visual environ­
ment where everything is crisp and 
richly hued, dark in some places and 
bright in others. The titles in particu­
lar stand out with their deep blue, 
early morning shots. As a final touch, 
the score is haunting at times and 
highlights the insanity of the entire 
situation.
With all these elements working 
together, it would seem that the 
viewer would be taken aback at the 
sheer power of The Crucible, but to 
my own surprise, it didn’t happen. I 
sympathized with the innocent char­
acters and hated all the. Satanic 
mumbo-jumbo, but overall the movie 
lacked bite: Perhaps it was because I 
had already read the play and knew 
the ending, but I felt that a movie I 
was seeing for the first time should be 
able to excite.

CD set showcases 
musician’s dark side
By SCOTT SHELL
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The enigmatic and delightfully maca­
bre realms of Danny Elfman welcome us 
once more. Just released is the 
composer’s Music For a Darkened The­
atre — Film and Television Music — 
Volume 2, an anthology of various works 
since the release of Volume I in 1990.
Who: Danny Elfman 
What: Music For a Darkened 
Theatre—Film and Television 
Music — Vol. 2 
Label: MCA Records
If you’ve never heard of Danny Elfman, 
you’ve surely heard him. Oingo Boingo 
band member turned film-scorer, he’s 
the engineer behind some of Hollywood’s 
most memorable themes. Remember 
Batman? How aboutBeetlejuice 
or The Simpsons? They’re all 
Elfman’s exotic landscapes, 
marked by his inventive and 
passionate style. He possesses 
a uniqueness that not only lures 
audiences, but countless film 
and television moguls as well.
In VolumeII, Elfman departs 
the main-and-closing-titles for­
mat of the original volume in 
favor of a medley approach. The 
two-CD set consists of 10 movie 
suites touching on main 
themes, and a collection of tele­
vision odds-and-ends.
While there are quite a few less-famil­
iar and less-fulfilling segments, the al­
bum contains a number of Elfman clas­
sics. It opens appropriately with Ed­
ward Scissorhands. Unmistakably 
Elfman, the suite maneuvers its way 
through faerie-tale shadows and cap­
tures childhood memories. In its own 
tender way, it reconstructs youth, crys­
tallized and shimmering.
The Batman Returns suite visits an 
old melody, but gives it a Penguin and
Catwoman. The two additional themes 
are mournful and harsh, going beyond 
adventuresome brass and into sophisti­
cated characterization. It’s very ear- 
catching and distinct, but like the movie, 
not quite as effective as the original. A 
nice surprise is Dolores Claiborne, where 
Elfman’s characteristic dark melodies 
are more mature and sinister, with many 
elements of serialism. The strings send 
shivers as he creates a musical profile of 
a neurotic.
The Nightmare Before Christmas suite 
is the most fun. It highlights the movie’s 
enchanting melodies minus the vocals. 
It’s a dark-side-of-Disneyland tour, al­
though “What’s This?,” the signature 
theme, has only a brief, disappointing 
cameo. In compensation, the original 
demo version of “This Is Halloween” is 
added, with Elfrnan himself singing and

new CD set.
orchestrating on synthesizer all the 
parts.
The remaining portions of the CDs are 
devoted to less eminent films, and less 
interesting music. Black Beauty and 
Sommersby sound a little like stock ro­
manticism, while Mission Impossible, 
Dead Presidents, and Freeway are more 
contemporary and somewhat annoying. 
Even though it embraces some of 
Elfman’s most ingeniously written and 
orchestrated music, this is a two-CD set 
that probably should have been one disc.

Musical flick shines
By WVLADIMIR 
LABEEKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
Down we’re gonna shuffle, shuffle 
out to Buffalo. Thus goes one popular 
musical, 42nd Street. I never really 
understood the furor over musicals; 
Les Mis, The Phantom, Damn Yan­
kees; these musical do not affect me the 
way they do their fans. But I’ve found 
one that is different.
Everybody Says I Love You, besides 
being Woody Allen’s latest movie, is 
also a romantic musical 
comedy. Set in modern- day 
upscale New York, it 
chronicles the trials and 
tribulations of a family as 
they fall in and out of love.
That they sing their wor­
ries instead of whining 
about them may seem inci­
dental, but it works won- -----------
ders. The musical numbers 
fall exactly in place and, 
strange as it may seem, they do-not 
appear contrived (not even when a 
whole hospital staff starts singing and 
dancing to the tune of “Making 
Whoopee”). This is a notable achieve­
ment for any movie and it makes for a 
grand, joyful story without falling into 
overt ditziness.
You must know Allen’s idea of a 
musical is quite far from pur modern 
Broadway idea of it. In this movie, the 
characters literally break into song, 
spontaneously bringing out the
Gershwin in the park or at a rap con­
cert. “I wanted people to sound normal 
— you know, you’re with friends at d 
party or in the car and the spirit moves 
you and you sing. I wanted it to be with 
feeling, not slick and perfect and 
trained,” says Allen. This is a very nice 
and welcome contrast to the popular 
musicals of today.
Musicals are little more than ex­
cuses for ritualized showcases of elabo­
rate vocalizations, their effect manu­
factured precisely. Not so with Every­
body Says I Love You — after this
“/ wanted it to be with feel­
ing, not slick and perfect 
and trained. ”
—Woody Allen
movie you might find yourself craving 
for more of this old-style moviemaking.
Of course, like any Allen movie, this 
one has superlative photography (by 
the holy Carlo Di Palma) and genius 
casting; but it has a charm that’s 
somewhat different from that of some 
of his recent offerings. So if you are 
wary of the pre-packaged, calculated, 
cookie-cutter clout of say, “Evita,” then 
come watch a real musical, a truly 
beautiful movie — Everybody Says 1 
Love You.

Comic depicts superheroes with human side
COMIC BOOK 
CHRONICLES
by Max Chittister
Acclaim Comics sent me a free 
preview copy of Quantum and 
Woody #1, written by Christo­
pher Priest and drawn by M.D. 
“Doc” Bright and Greg Adams. 
Priest (when he was still known 
as Jim Owsley) and Doc are work­
ing on their first project together 
since their controversial run on 
Green Lantern in Action Comics 
Weekly. Maybe it’s just contro­
versial if you read Green Lan­
tern, but I know some people 
who’ll bite yer head off if you say 
you don’t like it.
% The overall plot of the book is 
this: “Two childhood friends re­
unite when their fathers are killed
and, while seeking revenge, be­
come the superhero team Quan­
tum and Woody.”
But adequately de­
scribing a Priest comic 
book by only talking 
about the plot is like 
trying to describe Jenny 
McCarthy by only talk­
ing about the dry skin 
on her left elbow.
The true genius of 
Priest is his dialogue.
There is an easy famil­
iarity in Priest’s words; 
his characters say 
things that real people 
might say in these situ­
ations.
Real people — I just 
realized how strange 
that might seem in a 
comicbook. His charac­
ters are real people first 
and superheroes sec­
ond. There are no su­
perhuman abilities in 
this comic book. Nary a 
ray gun to be found.
This book is about 
people.
The preview is almost entirely ure out what the plot is until 
character-driven; you don’t fig- about page 17. Before that, you
see Eric and Woody perform mad­
cap childhood hijinks. Watch 
Woody leave school because 
his parents are broke. See 
their reunion over their fa­
thers’ coffins in a wordless 
sequence that you 
couldn’t describe 
with exposition. 
Which brings

preview hasn’t 
been colored yet, and 
some of the pages are

talent is apparent at first

faces match Priest’s dialogue

example) don’t.

stop them from being friends. 1

It’s obvious these guys are hav­

ing together, and it shows. I think 
it’s the fun, more than anything, 
that makes me love this comic 
book. I like fun comic books, and 
if there’s one thing that Quan­
tum and Woody is, it’s fun.

Wings of Desire
This is some wacko, artsy European flick. This 
movie, set in West Berlin, is an attempt to provide 
a thought-provoking change of perspective on the 
absurdity, banality, and ultimate meaninglessness 
of human life. The movie centers around two 
angels, one who hangs out with Columbo, who 
walk the streets of Berlin casting dispersions on 
those of us who are still in human form. One of the 
angels wants to fall in love with a circus per­
former, so he goes into an angel rehab program.
It’s pretty much about his life and times as he 
approaches humanhood.
A critically-acclaimed commentary, Wings of 
Desire stars a cast of large, hairy French and 
German actors/actresses whose names you won’t 
recognize. It features a moody mood and a series 
of images that will keep you keeping on.

A Fish Called Wanda
The central character in this movie is a large, 
british-racing green terrapin whose name is Colin. 
Having lost all his turtle/tortoise/terrapin friends 
to the manufacture of aphrodisiacs, Colin sets off 
in search of a peaceful place to die.
Colin, played by John Cleese, makes many 
wonderful friends on the way; a large Portuguese 
outside linebacker (played by Michael Palin), a 
lascivious but articulate nude dancer (played by 
Jamie Lee Curtis), and a smelly rat (played by 
Kevin Klein).
There is no fish called Wanda in this movie. It 
is, however, a real gem of a flick. Plus, you get to 
see John Cleese’s butt, which is enough to heal a 
young girl’s goiter.

Phenomenon
Starring John Travolta as a real bad-ass who 
kills deer, maims rabbits, and topples govern­
ments just for fun, his character and demeanour 
undergo an immense transformation when some 
random woman with a cleaver lobotomizes him.
However, the movie described above may not be 
the same movie you see in the theatres. Alterna­
tively, Travolta is this really nice guy who gets 
zapped by a weird light on his birthday. A lot of 
people around his creepy little town said that it 
was the heroine he was shooting up, but suddenly 
this nice guy is really smart. I mean, he’s smarter 
thanyow.
Then he makes things move with a prehensile 
tail sticking out of the back of his neck.
This movie has an entertaining soundtrack, 
which includes a collaboration between Eric 
Clapton and Babyface, called “If I Could Maim a 
Squirrel.” Wonderful.

Fortress
A great deal of blood is spilled in this movie. 
This is not surprising since it’s the work of Austra­
lians. Aussies are not known for being passive 
when inebriated, and since they’re always inebri­
ated, they’re almost never known for never, or 
always, being, even sometimes, passive.
Anyhow, so a bunch of Aussies drank some 
"amber nectar,” stole a camera, and coerced a 
bunch of struggling actors into making a movie 
about a ginger bread house.

New season delivers mixed bag
ON THE TUBE
by Dan Rosenberg
The new year is upon us and, 
as we start our new classes, so 
begins a new television season. 
Hoping to join the ranks of 3rd 
Rock from the Sun, The Simpsons, 
and other midseason hits are a 
surprisingly large number of new 
series, including vehicles for 
Arsenio Hall, Newhart’s Julia 
Duffy, NYPD Blue's Sharon 
Lawrence, and Life Goes On’s 
Kellie Martin. In fact, the net­
works are trying so hard to launch 
hits in the first three months of 
the year that they are pre­
empting some of their biggest hits 
(namely Si? and NYPD Blue) and 
critics’ darlings (like Murder One 
and EZ Streets) to make room for 
these new shows.
Two of the first programs out of 
the gate illustrate the diversity 
among this year’s winter crop. 
One is an intense, intelligent 
drama set in the Big Easy, while 
another is a mildly amusing car­
toon set in the heart of the Lone 
Star state.
The drama is Orleans (CBS, 
Wednesdays, 10 to 11 pm), the 
first series for Dallas star Larry 
Hagman since his hugely suc­
cessful Texas soap went off the 
air in 1991. In his new show, 
Hagman plays the unorthodox 
and highly respected Luther 
Charbonnet, a no-nonsense ju­
rist who occasionally resolves dis­
putes brought to his courtroom 
by re-enacting them. For ex­
ample, when a lawsuit arose over 
whether or not an elderly man 
was eaten by alligators on the 
bayou, Charbonnet placed a me­
chanical manequin in the swamp 
and, sure enough, the dummy 
became alligator meat.
While Hagman gives a typi­
cally great performance, Orleans 
also allows its supporting play­
ers to shine. Vanessa Bell 
Calloway (Under One Roof) is sim­
ply wonderful as an eager public 
defender who is romantically in­
volved with Charbonnet, while 
Colleen Flynn (best known for 
playing the mother who died giv­
ing birth in the “Love’s Labor’s 
Lost” episode oiER) is nearly as 
good as Charbonnet’s daughter, 
a riverboat casino manager. Vet­
eran character actors Ralph 
Waite, Jerry Hardin, Charles 
Durning, and Mary Alice also pop
up every now and then, making 
the Orleans ensemble one of 
television’s finest.
In addition to possessing one of 
the best casts on television, Or­
leans also employs some of the 
best writers (including China 
Beach scribe John Sacret Young). 
The Orleans scripts are very com­
plex, but they provide an ex­
tremely rewarding viewing expe­
rience.
Between the interfamily and 
interracial romances, there are 
wonderfully complicated cases 
(including separate investiga­
tions involving the murder of a 
prominent senator and a mafia 
drug ring). Aside from occasion­
ally being a bit too hard to follow, 
Orleans is one of television’s fin­
est programs.
The same cannot be said for 
King of the Hill (Fox, Sundays, 
8:30 to 9 pm), an animated com­
edy from Greg Daniels and Mike 
Judge, the producers of two of the 
decade’s most successful ani­
mated sitcoms (The Simpsons and 
Beauis and Butt-head). Hill fol­
lows the day-to-day problems of 
the blue-collar Hill family of 
Arlen, Texas.
The plots are rather simplistic 
and predictable, but they do pro­
vide a few laughs. In the pilot, for 
example, a social services worker 
mistakenly believed that Hank,
the Hill patriarch, abused his son 
because the boy had a black eye 
(which he actually received by 
being in the path of an airborne 
baseball). Of course, matters were 
complicated by Hank’s wife Peggy 
(voiced by Sister Act’s Kathy 
Najimy) also getting hit by a base­
ball and the social worker wit­
nessing Hank’s playful rough- 
housing with his son. The series’s 
second episode, meanwhile, re­
volved around Hank’s trying to 
give his son “the talk,” only to 
learn that the boy would rather 
learn about the birds and the 
bees from a sex-education course 
taught by his mother.
Hill is a mildly amusing pro­
gram, but it focuses too much on 
slapstick rather than on satire. 
Sure, the pilot did take a few jabs 
at the Department of Social Ser­
vices, but the show seemed to be 
dumbed-down to attract children, 
which is unfortunate because Hill 
has the potential of being an ex­
cellent show for adults.
While Hill may not be great 
television, it is certainly better 
than most sitcoms currently on 
the air. Furthermore, by airing 
on the same night as the dreadful 
3rd Rock from the Sun and Bos­
ton Corfimon, Hill comes off even 
better.

Indie band makes strong debut
By TOM LIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Radioactive Records, a relatively minor la­
bel, hit the big time several years ago with Live 
and their hit album, Throwing Copper. It just 
might happen again with Radio Iodine, an 
alternative rock band from St. Louis that just 
completed their first EP for Radioactive. If 
“Never Meant to Lie,” the single which first 
prompted Radioactive to sign Radio Iodine, is 
as good as their EP, then Radioactive may have 
a gold mine on their hands.
Who: Radio Iodine 
What: 5algu Tulgpi 
Label: Radioactive
Radio Iodine is a five-person band, centered 
around the strong, throaty voice of Ellen Persyn, 
with Tony Persyn on bass and sequencing. 
Tom Bramer plays guitar for the band, with 
excellent results. Anna Berry sings background 
vocals and handles the keyboard as well. Fi­
nally, Greg Miller does a fine job on the drums. 
The songs for Radio Iodine were co-written by 
Ellen and Tony Persyn.
The self-titled album has four songs on it, 
beginning with the single “Things I Do.” With 
a heavy bass line, the song has a strong rhythm
and beat. It is enigmatic, switching between 
minimalist drum beats and crashing guitars 
throughout the song. The song also intro­
duces a variety of images, which appear to 
rise up against the confines of society. “I have 
this hidden list that runs my life and says, 
‘good girl bad girl, worthless worth.’ ”
The rest of the songs on the EP are almost 
as good as the first, and seem to be danceable

Radioactive Iodine makes Its debut with a 
self-titled album.
pop songs as well as alterna-rock cre­
ations. “Better Off’ is a catchy song that 
never loses its tempo. From the opening 
chords to the last drumbeats, the well- 
crafted tune will have you at least tapping 
your feet, if not dancing. Though the lyr­
ics are actually rather depressing, the 
powerful beat will make you forget or not 
care about them.
The third song, “Human Nature,” is a 
slight letdown after “Better Off,” with less 
melody and abrupt changes in tempo, the 
song is hard to categorize and rather con­
fusing.
The album ends on a strong note with 
the angry “Sleep,” leaving the listener 
charged with energy. With their trade­
mark changes between loud and subdued, 
the song retains a strong beat while also 
being an atypical rock grrrl anthem.
With powerful songwriting, good beats, 
and an excellent lead singer, Radio Iodine 
seems to have the right ingredients for 
success in the music industry. Whether or 
not they will ever see the success of other 
Radioactive bands such as Live remains 
to be seen, but their first album for their 
label is quite promising. In any case, if 
you like alternative rock as well as intél- 
ligent songs, then I’d recommend picking 
up Radio Iodine.
