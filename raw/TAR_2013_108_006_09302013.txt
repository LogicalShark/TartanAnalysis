As an insider of the war 
in Afghanistan, former U.S. 
Army Lieutenant General 
and former Ambassador 
to Afghanistan Karl Eiken-
berry spoke last Friday 
about the limits of Ameri-
can political intervention 
to Pittsburgh community 
members, Carnegie Mel-
lon students, faculty, and 
families.
University President 
Subra Suresh introduced 
Eikenberry before his lec-
ture, which took place in 
McConomy Auditorium 
and was a part of Cèilidh 
Weekend.
Using examples from his 
experience in Afghanistan, 
Eikenberry stressed that 
making Afghanistan a bet-
ter place to live is a good 
goal, but should not be of 
national importance. 
According to Eikenberry, 
military leaders stressed 
that there was no other op-
tion other than the one that 
they took in directly enter-
ing Afghanistan and in?u-
encing change in terms of 
the country’s economy, ed-
ucational standards, health 
care, and system of gover-
nance.
In his lecture, Eiken-
berry addressed and tested 
three assumptions of Field 
Manual 3-24, one of many 
?eld manuals that outline 
army tactics, techniques, 
and procedures. 
He primarily focused 
on the effectiveness of the 
counterinsurgency (COIN) 
operation, which involved 
suppressing rebellion.
The ?rst assumption was 
that the COIN doctrine goal 
would protect the Afghani

“Cities die. And then cities 
come back. Cities get ?ooded, 
cities get bombed, cities get 
burnt down, cities’ economies 
fail, but cities are resilient.”
That was the message 
from city council member and 
2013 Democratic nominee for 
Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto 
in Baker Hall’s Giant Eagle 
Auditorium last Friday. Pedu-
to’s lecture focused ?rst on 
the history of Pittsburgh and 
its various stages of decline 
and renewal, and then on his 
plans as a mayoral candidate 
to continue the revitalization 
of the city.
Peduto is currently a city 
councilman; according to the 
Pittsburgh city government 
website, he is serving his third 
term and represents Pitts-
burgh’s East End, including 
the neighborhoods of Bloom-
?eld, Oakland, Shadyside, 
Squirrel Hill, East Liberty, and 
Point Breeze.
Peduto’s lecture began 
with a brief history of Pitts-
burgh, from the time it was 
carved out of America’s virgin 
forests to its industrial boom 
in the early 20th century and 
subsequent economic slump. 
The problem with Pittsburgh 
during this time, Peduto said, 
was what he called the “David 
Lawrence strategy” of urban 
development.
Lawrence was mayor of 
Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959, 
and later served as governor 
of Pennsylvania from 1959 to 
1963. Lawrence, Peduto said, 
embraced the philosophy of 
top-down city development, 
which included the funding 
of large projects similar to the 
construction of Three Rivers 
Stadium and the Consol En-
ergy Center.
“That was what their eco-
nomic development strategy 
was. It was big. It was going 
to the North Side, tear out 
the North Side, put in a mall 
— Allegheny Center Mall. Go 
in to East Liberty, tear up the 
neighborhood, build a big 
race track around it and make 
it so it’s more of an automo-

University President Sub-
ra Suresh addressed key is-
sues facing Carnegie Mellon 
University and listened to the 
school community voice its 
concerns in two addresses. 
The ?rst address took place 
last Monday in the Gates Hill-
man Complex’s Rashid Audi-
torium, and the second one 
occurred last Saturday in the 
University Center’s McCono-
my Auditorium.
These events marked the 
continuation of Suresh’s lis-
tening tour, an extended ef-
fort by Suresh to discuss and 
learn more about topics of 
interest to various groups as-
sociated with Carnegie Mel-
lon. The tour, which has of?-
cially been going on for three 
months, includes multiple 
sessions between Suresh and 
campus af?liates. The ad-
dress on Monday was geared 
toward undergraduate and 
graduate students, whereas 
Saturday’s address targeted 
parents and alumni in honor 
of Cèilidh Weekend.
“I ?nd it extremely helpful 
to listen to the different per-
spectives and get a window 
into what’s on different peo-
ple’s minds,” Suresh said dur-
ing the ?rst event last week.
One recurring topic in the 
addresses was Carnegie Mel-
lon’s emphasis on interdisci-
plinary studies. According to 
Suresh, the school’s strength 
lies in its well-roundedness.
“I hope that your children 
who are here getting an edu-
cation will sample the rich va-
riety of opportunities that ex-
ist on campus and also learn 
from them because they are 
going to be future leaders,” 
Suresh said in his address to 
parents.
More speci?cally, Suresh 
discussed challenges of the 
21st century and related them 
to the importance of a broad 
educational foundation. He 
cited a causal relationship be-
tween many of the century’s 
biggest advancements and 
biggest problems, for which 
he blamed on innovators’ fail-
ures to connect technological 
challenges with human chal-
lenges. At Carnegie Mellon, 
however, Suresh believes the 
interdisciplinary opportuni-

Turi Alcoser, a Carnegie 
Mellon Class of 2012 gradu-
ate, died last Monday. His 
death was ?rst reported 
Tuesday both of?cially via 
the university administra-
tion and by the student 
newspaper at Cornell Uni-
versity, where the 23-year-
old was a Ph.D. student in 
the College of Engineering.
The San Antonio Express-
News in Alcoser’s home 
town of San Antonio, Texas, 
reported Sunday that Alcos-
er’s death was a suicide. Un-
of?cial sources con?rmed 
this, although authorities at 
Cornell and several sources 
in Ithaca, N.Y., did not of-
?cially release a cause of 
death.
A short statement re-
leased by Cornell’s Vice 
President for Student and 
Academic Affairs, Susan 
Murphy, detailed Alcoser’s 
promising career as a re-
searcher and expressed sad-
ness at his sudden passing.
“On behalf of the entire 
Cornell community, I want 
to extend my deepest con-
dolences to Turi’s family, 
friends, and colleagues,” 
Murphy wrote. “Please join 
me in taking a moment 
to remember Turi and ac-
knowledge this unfortunate 
loss to our community.”
Alcoser graduated from 
Carnegie Mellon with a ma-
jor in materials science and 
engineering and a minor 
in biomedical engineering. 
He entered Cornell in June 
2012, where his Ph.D. work 
in biomedical engineering 
was on growing and char-
acterizing the biophysical 
properties of breast cancer 
tumor cells, Murphy’s state-
ment said.

egie Mellon was similarly

Dean of Student Affairs Gina 
Casalegno ?rst alerted the campus 
community of an ongoing inves-
tigation into the Carnegie Mellon 
chapter of the Beta Theta Pi frater-
nity last semester, on March 29. In 
the email she sent out, Casalegno 
said that the fraternity was being 
investigated for “alleged videos 
and pictures of a sexual nature.”
The investigation involved 
Carnegie Mellon University Po-
lice and the Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Police, and WTAE-TV Pittsburgh 
also con?rmed in April that the Al-
legheny County District Attorney’s 
Of?ce was in contact with the 
school “regarding recent behavior 
on campus.” Beta was suspended 
during the investigation, and the 
chapter was ultimately shut down 
by the national fraternity for “haz-
ing.”
After the incident, Carnegie 
Mellon released a media state-
ment on March 29 that said, “Due 
to the ongoing nature of this in-
vestigation, we cannot comment 
further on the details of the case at 
this time.” No followup statement 
was subsequently released. There 
is evidence that the university in-
vestigation, which University Po-
lice told Casalegno had of?cially 
closed on Aug. 22, may not have 
met federal standards and regula-
tions for reporting crimes that oc-
cur on a college campus.
The Clery Act
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure 
of Campus Security Policy and 
Campus Crime Statistics Act, more 
commonly known as the Clery Act, 
is a federal law enforced by the 
U.S. Department of Education that 
requires colleges and universi-
ties to disclose information about 
crimes that occur on and around 
their campuses.
The Clery Act’s requirements 
include publishing an annual se-
curity report, disclosing crime sta-
tistics for crimes that occur on and 
around campuses, issuing timely 
warnings to the campus communi-
ty about crimes that pose a serious 
or ongoing threat to students and 
employees, and having a public 
crime log.
“In general, the crime logs are 
made available to inform the cam-
pus community about crimes and 
to create transparency on cam-
pus,” explained Abigail Boyer, 
the assistant executive director 
of programs, outreach, and com-
munications for the Clery Center 
for Security On Campus. The log 
must include the “nature, date, 
time, and general location of each 
crime” and be available for the 
public’s inspection.

Armed Robbery 
Sept. 21, 2013
University Police were 
summoned to Alder Street 
just past midnight when two 
Carnegie Mellon students 
were robbed at gunpoint. Ac-
cording to the victims, a blue 
Chevrolet Impala pulled up 
to them as they were walking 
on Alder Street. A young black 
male with short hair asked 
the victims the time and pre-
sented a handgun, demanding 
their money. The Pittsburgh 
Bureau of Police is continu-
ing to investigate this incident 
alongside similar robberies 
that have occurred in the area.

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity’s master of arts manage-
ment (MAM) program an-
nounced the launch of its new 
Arts Management & Technol-
ogy Laboratory (AMTLab).
AMTLab is a research cen-
ter meant to provide top-level 
practices and technologies to 
art managers, technologists, 
and researchers in the MAM 
program.
In a university press re-
lease, Executive Director of 
AMTLab Brett Crawford said, 
“AMTLab serves as a resource 
to a ?eld that has few op-
tions available to it. Perhaps 
most importantly, AMTLab 
stands to help solve critical 
questions facing today’s arts 
managers and technologists, 
while contributing to the in-
novations necessary for fu-
ture effective application of 
technology in the arts man-
agement ?eld.”
Along with Crawford, two 
Heinz College graduate stu-
dents are leading the project. 
These students are tasked 
with developing and publi-
cizing the site. One student 
will be chief editor, and the 
other will be chief coordina-
tor. 
AMTLab has an on-
line forum, www.amt-lab.
org, which shares a blog 
with research updates from 
contributors and case studies 
of art organizations.
According to the press re-
lease, Director of the MAM 
program Kathryn Heide-
mann said, “Technology is 
now a function of all areas 
of arts management — no 
longer just IT departments — 
and this center helps our stu-
dents as well as the greater 
arts community understand 
both the theoretical and 
practical intersections be-
tween arts management and 
technology.”

Graduate students awarded scholarships
The Department of 
Homeland Security’s Cy-
berCorps Scholarship for 
Service (SFS) Program, the 
National Science Founda-
tion, and the Department of 
Defense’s Information Assur-
ance Scholarship Program 
(IASP) awarded 17 graduate 
students from Carnegie Mel-
lon with cybersecurity schol-
arships. The IASP award 
went to two students from 
the Information Networking 
Institute (INI), while the SFS 
awards went to six students 
from INI and two students 
from the Heinz College.
According to a university 
press release, INI Director 
and Director of Education, 
Training and Outreach Dena 
Haritos Tsamitis said, “As fu-
ture federal employees, the 
SFS and IASP scholars delve 
into challenging engineering 
and information assurance 
coursework and engage in 
interdisciplinary cybersecu-
rity research. In addition to 
the emphasis on the technol-
ogies and strategies related 
to digital defense and of-
fense, Carnegie Mellon’s cy-
bersecurity curricula explore 
risk management, econom-
ics, and policy issues related 
to reducing vulnerability 
and securing our national 
information infrastructure.”
Carnegie Mellon is recog-
nized by the National Securi-
ty Agency and United States 
Cyber Command as a Na-
tional Center for Academic 
Excellence in operations for 
the period 2013–18.
 With cyberattacks on the 
rise, the U.S. government 
now values the training 
and retention of cybersecu-
rity experts more than ever. 
Carnegie Mellon, recognized 
for its work in this ?eld, has 
graduated over 160 students 
in the SFS program in the 
past decade.

Poteat spoke of how left-
over funds — previously al-
located for speci?c organiza-
tions by the JFC — were dealt 
with, and explained what 
happened to organizations 
that had overspent their JFC 
accounts. 
According to Poteat, orga-
nizations that overspent will 
remain in good standing if the 
organization used money that 
had rolled over from the pre-
vious ?scal year, if the organi-
zation is supervised, or if the 
organization is on controlled

Poteat talked about the 
process for helping organiza-

a weekly meeting between 
Poteat and the leaders of or-
ganizations on controlled 
probation.

ties allow students to analyze 
problems from both scienti?c 
and humanities perspectives.
“CMU is one of the very 
few institutions that’s so 
uniquely positioned to bring 
the two, [humanities and sci-
ences], together in ways that 
most other institutions can-
not,” Suresh said.
First-year business ad-
ministration major Radhika 
Dalal agreed with Suresh’s 
claims about the strength of 
cross-disciplinary studies, 
which she cites as the reason 
for her decision to attend the 
university.
“I want to be on the busi-
ness side of a technological 
company, and Carnegie Mel-
lon is really great at integrat-
ing the two ?elds together,” 
Dalal said.
However, some students 
voiced concerns about actual-
ly getting into classes outside 
of their primary major or de-
partment. Suresh responded 
by stating that one of his long-
term goals is to increase com-
munication and openness be-
tween departments, as well as 
make the university feel more 
uni?ed as a whole.
Another major discus-
sion point revolved around 
changes in higher education 
in general, such as online edu-
cation, technology-enhanced 
learning, and the open access 
movement. Suresh addressed 
the complicated nuances of 
these developments, focus-
ing namely on their ?nancial 
challenges.
“In an ideal world, open 
access is what we want, but 
without a viable ?nancial 
model, it will not work,” 
Suresh said.
Audience member and 
parent of a student Patricia 
Petrick appreciated Suresh’s 
practical mindset about edu-
cational changes.
“I think he has excellent 
insights into the problems of 
higher education, and that in-
cludes how you fund the very 
sophisticated education being 
provided,” Petrick said.
Petrick attributed her re-
alistic perspective to her pre-
vious experience working in 
policy with the director of the 
National Science Foundation 
(NSF).
Suresh spoke more in 
depth about his professional 
background during his Sat-
urday address and connected 
it with his current position at 
Carnegie Mellon, describing 
both the NSF and the univer-
sity as institutions whose in-
vestments yield high returns.
“CMU has produced more 
spin off companies per dollar 
of research money spent than 
any other university in the 
country without a medical 
school,” Suresh said.
Bill Mullins, husband of 
Patricia Petrick, appreciated 
Suresh’s ability to recognize 
and articulate the various 
strengths and values of the 
university. “He understands 
the Carnegie Mellon culture, 
seems very comfortable with 
it, seems to encourage it, like 
it, and he’s going to perpetu-
ate it,” Mullins said.
Suresh will continue 
reaching out to the commu-
nity on his listening tour dur-
ing upcoming events that are 
in the process of being sched-
uled. More information about 
attending a discussion ses-
sion with the president can be 
found on the Carnegie Mellon 
website at http://www.cmu.
edu/leadership/president-
suresh/.
Suresh continues listening tour
population with a perimeter 
that distinguished “bad guys 
from good guys.” Secondly, 
the Afghan government 
would become more legiti-
mate and accountable with 
higher levels of American 
support. Lastly, COIN doc-
trine — as applied in Afghani-
stan — was aligned with the 
political military approach 
of the Afghanistan President 
Hamid Karzai’s administra-
tion.
Eikenberry asked audi-
ence members to raise their 
hands for what they believed 
would be positive and effec-
tive goals for supporting the 
Afghani people. The audience 
was in favor of protecting the 
Afghani population against 
the Taliban and NARCO traf-
?ckers while increasing em-
ployment levels and provid-
ing health care.
Protection against venal 
police chiefs, Eikenberry 
pointed out, is a more divisive 
issue because of the compli-
cated nature of whom to pro-
tect the Afghani people from. 
The predatory dominant tribe 
has friends in the Karzai ad-
ministration, and the lesser 
tribe has taken to the Taliban 
for help.
Eikenberry posed the 
question: Is it the United 
States’ role to get engaged in 
that international ?ght?
“These are the questions 
that every day on the ground, 
your soldiers, your diplomats 
are struggling over,” he said.
In addressing the second 
claim of Field Manual 3-24, 
Eikenberry questioned the 
argument that increased mili-
tary support over time would 
?x the Afghan government.
“The government of Af-
ghanistan today draws about 
7 percent of their GDP, almost 
all of that comes from custom 
polls.… The people are 
not being taxed. 
The services 
that are being 
provided, 
80 percent 
is coming 
from the in-
ternational 
payroll, or 
international 
donations,” 
he said.
The third 
assumption was that moving 
forward with a counterinsur-
gency strategy will be em-
braced by that nation’s leader. 
“I’ll tell you, in Afghanistan, 
this was not the case,” Eiken-
berry said.
Eikenberry posited that 
one reason for the lack of em-
brace of COIN strategies was 
differences in geopolitical 
framework. “There was a do-
mestic political problem that 
traces back to Afghanistan’s 
history in being ruled by vari-
ous powers.”
Eikenberry also spoke of 
the limits of American inter-
vention by pointing out the 
risks of blindly committing 
to the statements outlined in 
the ?eld manual without any 
consideration for other costs 
or repercussions.
“Extended military cam-
paigns that are priced in the 
trillion-dollar range, as this 
one in Iraq had been, carry 
with them many other high 
national security costs,” he 
said.
“The war in Afghani-
stan has demonstrated, in 
my mind, that in the thrall 
of wanted agility and re-
sourcefulness of our Ameri-
can forces, the risk of senior 
commanders becoming intel-
lectually arrogant and com-
parably rigid is very real,” he 
continued.
Junior business admin-
istration major Alec Abitbol 
considered Eikenberry’s posi-
tion regarding counterinsur-
gency. “General Eikenberry’s 
re?ection on the strategy of 
counterinsurgency, de?ned 
by a focus on improving in-
frastructure and living condi-
tions as opposed to military 
efforts, proposes a sentiment 
of regret for our involve-
ment in the Middle East. [He 
brought] two important ques-
tions to mind: What if those 
resources had been spent 
domestically? [And] under 
what circumstances is 
international inter-
vention a net nega-
tive for the U.S.?”
Eikenberry 
also pointed out 
that the serious-
ness and zeal 
with which the 
Field Manual 3-24 
was 
applied, left little room for 
critical thought or question-
ing.
“However, the assump-
tions and risk analysis that 
underpin a plan must be 
continually challenged in a 
dynamic and complex con-
?ict zone, lest command-
ers ?nd themselves ?ghting 
the wrong war. Our military 
thought leaders must ?nd a 
way to avoid this kind of trap 
in the future,” he said. 
Eikenberry, however, fol-
lowed his statement with a 
counterargument — saying 
that out of this blind commit-
ment has come a largely posi-
tive outcome. “Having said 
all of this, believe me, a lot of 
great things have been done 
and will be done in Afghani-
stan,” he said.
As an example, Eikenberry 
explained that 8 million chil-
dren are in schools — some-
thing that he describes as “an 
impressive, impressive ac-
complishment.”
“Ambassador Eikenberry 
provided a critique of the 
counterinsurgency strategy 
of our U.S. military that has 
been applied since the mid-
2000s in Iraq and Afghani-
stan, and he did so from a 
humanities and social science 
standpoint,” said Kiron Skin-
ner, director of the Center of 
International Relations and 
Politics. “To me, there could 
be no better military leader 
to speak at Carnegie Mellon 
— he addressed a fundamen-
tal issue in asking ‘Is the U.S. 
military capable of rebuilding 
a nation and should that be 
what the U.S. military does?’ ”
“This was an important 
event during our Cèilidh 
Weekend, and to me, it rep-
resents Carnegie Mellon at 
its best to have a speaker who 
was speaking on a major set 
of issues facing our nation 
and the world from an in-
terdisciplinary standpoint,” 
Skinner said. “I was also hon-
ored that our new president 
Dr. Suresh introduced Am-
bassador Eikenberry — to see 
that our president, as busy as 
he is during his ?rst semester 
as president, is participating 
in our campus-wide effort for 
international issues was en-
couraging.”
Eikenberry’s lecture was 
sponsored by the Center 
for International Rela-
tions and Politics and 
supported by the Hu-
manities Scholars 
Program, the Of?ce 
of the Vice Provost 
for Education, the 
department of so-
cial and decision 
sciences, and 
the department 
of modern lan-
guages.

explicit photographs taken 
without consent and sexual 
assault. However, there is no 
mention of the investigation 
or any cases involving sexually 
explicit photographs or sexual 
assault in the University Police 
crime log, which is available 
for inspection at the front desk 
of the police station. 
When asked about the dis-
crepancy, University Police 
lieutenant Gary Scheimer 
said, “The crime log is not up-
dated with ongoing informa-
tion that is uncovered during 
a criminal investigation.... 
The original report is pub-
lished, but not the updates of 
an ongoing investigation.”
However, when told that 
the original report had not 
been published in the crime 
log either, he went to check 
for the report in the crime log 
and con?rmed that it was not 
in the log, saying, “The way  
[the investigation] came in, it 
did not come in on the media 
log.”
Casalegno could not be 
reached for an interview in 
person or on the phone, but 
she wrote in an emailed state-
ment, “I have full con?dence 
they [University Police] fol-
lowed their procedures and 
ensured complete compliance 
with the Clery Act throughout 
this investigation.”
While Boyer could not 
comment on individual cas-
es, she said that if a student 
thinks that his or her case 
was handled in a way that did 
not meet the standards of the 
Clery Act, “I always encourage 
student to talk to their institu-
tions to ask questions about 
what information is available. 
In addition ... an individual 
has the option of ?ling a com-
plaint with the Department of 
Education.” 
The complaint would be 
handled administratively, 
rather than in court. If the 
Department of Education 
?nds a complaint to be valid, 
a university could be ?ned 
up to $35,000 per infraction 
and, in extreme cases, could 
be suspended from partici-
pation in student ?nancial 
aid programs. This is not the 
?rst time that questions have 
arisen over Carnegie Mellon’s 
handling of a sexual assault 
case. In May 2012, Nicole 
Ickes published a blog post al-
leging that Carnegie Mellon 
had mishandled a sexual as-
sault case that she reported to 
the university in March 2011. 
She wrote that she was not 
informed of academic accom-
modations that the Depart-
ment of Education’s Title IX 
requires universities to make 
available to sexual assault 
survivors.
Beta investigation
When asked about the out-
come of the investigation into 
Beta, Scheimer said he would 
have to check with Casalegno 
and the university’s Of?ce of 
General Counsel to see what 
information he was allowed to 
disclose. As of press time, he 
had not contacted The Tartan 
with any information about 
the investigation’s results.
As of May 8, three sexual 
assault cases had been re-
ferred for disciplinary review 
through the university in 
2013. 
Casalegno could not say 
what month these cases oc-
curred, or if they were con-
nected to Beta. When asked 
about her opinion of the in-
vestigation, Casalegno said 
via email, “I believe the in-
vestigation was handled with 
utmost sensitivity and profes-
sionalism by our university 
police. They partnered very 
closely with the division of 
student affairs to ensure ap-
propriate engagement with 
the men of Beta and with 
any potential members of the 
community who might have 
been involved in the matters 
they were investigating.”
National trend
Numerous universities 
around the country have re-
cently been accused of not fol-
lowing federal requirements 
for sexual assault cases. Last 
October, a student at Wesley-
an University in Middletown, 
Conn., sued the university for 
not following Title IX require-
ments when she was raped 
at the Mu Epsilon chapter of 
Beta Theta Pi. 
37 students and alumni 
at Occidental College in Los 
Angeles ?led a lawsuit and a 
Clery Act complaint in April 
that alleged the school had 
mishandled their sexual as-
sault cases. The school re-
cently settled the lawsuit, 
while the Department of Edu-
cation’s investigation into the 
Clery Act complaint is still on-
going.
In May, Yale University was 
?ned $165,000 by the Depart-
ment of Education for “seri-
ous and numerous” Clery Act 
violations, including not re-
porting forcible sex offenses. 
The ?ne was later reduced to 
$155,000.
Peduto discusses plans for Pittsburgh
bile-driven area than it was. 
It was go in to the Hill Dis-
trict, tear down the Hill Dis-
trict, put in this development, 
and see what would happen 
around it,” he said.
This strategy, Peduto said, 
drove people out of Pitts-
burgh instead of having the 
intended effect of revitalizing 
the metropolis.
“We invested in a whole 
new system of highways, 
and what did that do? It cre-
ated driveways for people to 
leave this city and move fur-
ther out, and the investment 
dollars continued to be fewer 
and fewer,” Peduto said.
According to Peduto, dur-
ing this time Pittsburgh “was 
leading the country in popu-
lation loss and job loss. In 
fact, during the ’80s we lost 
more people than New Or-
leans lost after Katrina.”
Peduto plans to embrace a 
more bottom-up strategy that 
involves focusing on com-
munity development in areas 
such as East Liberty. Peduto is 
also focusing on education as 
a means of social mobility.
“We can reinvest in our 
infrastructure, the same way 
they did back in the old days; 
we can sustain jobs, and we 
can provide early education 
for all children. If you ask any-
one in education what would 
get kids to break the cycle of 
poverty, it’s early childhood 
education,” he said.
At the end of his lecture, 
Peduto took questions from 
the audience — comprised of 
students, faculty, and Pitts-
burgh residents — and spoke 
more speci?cally about his 
plans if he were to be elected 
mayor.
“We’re going to be creat-
ing, within our new adminis-
tration, an entire new bureau 
called the Bureau of Special 
Projects, which is going to 
work with our special interest 
community. Because it’s time 
we get back with them.”
Peduto’s message was one 
of hope for Pittsburgh; a hope 
that he will lead it to a point 
where the city is comparable 
with cities like Austin, Texas 
and Seattle, Wash.
He spoke as part of the 
Forum on Economic Devel-
opment, which, according to 
pamphlets given out at the 
event, “research[es] the eco-
nomic development strate-
gies of major actors in the 
Southwest Pennsylvania area 
and the impact of their re-
sulting actions on sustainable 
employment opportunities 
made available.”
The Forum on Economic 
Development is also respon-
sible for “designing and de-
veloping programs and ini-
tiatives to generate jobs for 
those most impacted by the 
300,000 manufacturing jobs 
lost in Pennsylvania since 
2000: the undereducated, 
minority workers and people 
over age 50,” according to the 
brochure. 
Peduto, the Pittsburgh city 
government website says, is a 
“self-described ‘Reform Dem-
ocrat’ , ” and wrote the “most 
comprehensive package of 
government reform legisla-
tion in Pittsburgh’s history.”
Peduto is also co-creator 
of the city’s Comprehensive 
Climate Action Plan, acting as 
the “champion of protecting 
and enhancing Pittsburgh’s 
new reputation as a leader in 
green initiatives,” according 
to the website.

tended the university’s Sum-
mer Academy for Mathemat-
ics and Science (SAMS) pro-
gram as a high schooler in 
2007, then joined the univer-
sity as a CIT undergraduate in 
fall 2008.
He was a 2009 participant 
in the biology department’s 
Summer Research Institute, 
mentored by biology profes-
sor Gordon Rule. 
Later, he conducted cancer 
cell research with Kris Dahl, 
an associate professor of Bio-
medical Engineering and 
Chemical Engineering.
“SAMS builds dreams that 
you would not have even 
thought of had you not come 
here,” Alcoser said in a July 
2010 university press release. 
“My dream was speci?cally 
research.”
His work in the laboratory 
brought Alcoser accolades 
from two universities and be-
yond. His research with Dahl 
led to features on the Carn-
egie Mellon website and an 
imaging award from the De-
partment of Materials Science 
and Engineering.
At Cornell, Alcoser was 
a Sloan Scholar and won an 
award from the Physical Sci-
ences Oncology Network. 
This year, he was an honor-
able mention recipient of the 
National Science Founda-
tion’s Graduate Research Fel-
lowships.
“Turi was a student who 
was well-connected and be-
loved by many on our cam-
pus who knew him through 
his many contributions to the 
CMU community,” Carnegie 
Mellon Dean of Student Af-
fairs Gina Casalegno said in 
an email. “He will be deeply 
missed by those faculty, stu-
dents, staff and alumni whose 
lives he touched.”
In April 2011, Alcoser ran 
for Student Body President 
as an outsider, with Kelsey 
Briggs in the vice presidential 
slot. 
The candidates’ platform 
focused on health and well-
ness, collaboration between 
undergraduate and graduate 
students, and diversity.
Alcoser mentioned reduc-
ing student stress as a par-
ticularly important issue for 
him during the campaign. 
“I want to show that when I 
leave here from Carnegie Mel-
lon, I recognized this problem 
and I did something about 
it,” he said in a March 2011 
interview. The Alcoser-Briggs 
ticket was ultimately defeated 
by Jake Flittner and Sangita 
Sharma.
Increasing awareness of 
mental health issues on cam-
pus has been an ongoing pro-
cess, Casalegno said Sunday.
“Turi’s passing is a remind-
er to us all that, while we can 
never know why someone’s 
life ends by suicide, we can 
join together to cultivate a 
caring, compassionate, and 
supportive community that 
provides resources and out-
reach to help individuals who 
are struggling,” she said.
Alcoser was also a member 
of Delta Tau Delta and a staff-
writer for The Tartan.
Funeral services and buri-
al will take place today at the 
Mission Burial Park South 
in San Antonio, according to 
an obituary in the [ITAL]San

In order to facilitate discus-
sion on the impact of federal 
and academic initiatives on 
neurological research, Carn-
egie Mellon held the “Impact 
of BRAIN and Mind Research 
Symposium” last Saturday. It 
focused on the Brain Research 
through Advanced Innovative 
Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) 
initiative, which awards aca-
demic institutions research 
grants to further brain re-
search.
According to the White 
House website, BRAIN aims 
to develop new techniques 
for the prevention and treat-
ment of brain disorders like 
Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, 
autism, epilepsy, Parkinson’s, 
and traumatic brain injury.
This symposium was the 
?rst of Carnegie Mellon’s 
yearlong “Crossing Boundar-
ies, Transforming Lives” sym-
posia in celebration of Subra 
Suresh’s inaugural year as the 
university’s ninth president. 
Its discussion panel included 
faculty from various depart-
ments and schools at Carnegie 
Mellon, as well as Harvard 
University, the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and 
the White House’s Of?ce of 
Science and Technology Policy.
Suresh said that brain re-
search has immediate and 
practical effects in solving 
real-world issues.
“It’s not just an academic 
exercise,” Suresh said in his 
speech. “It’s a major day-to-
day issue. More than 50 per-
cent of all Americans over 
the age of 85 will develop Al-
zheimer’s. Combine that with 
other brain diseases … and 
the societal need for [BRAIN] 
is compelling.” 
He also added that a sig-
ni?cant fraction, about 20–25 
percent, of U.S. soldiers return 
from wars abroad with trau-
matic brain injury.
Speaking on Carnegie Mel-
lon’s and Pittsburgh’s roles 
in supporting the initiative, 
Suresh said, “Pittsburgh, in 
general, as a city, and CMU 
and the University of Pitts-
burgh as partnering entities, 
have played a leading role. 
The Center for the Neural Ba-
sis of Cognition, which is a 
joint effort between the two 
institutions, has been a leader 
in pioneering research.”
Tom Mitchell, head of the 
machine learning department, 
explained his interest in how 
the brain deals with language 
processing. He highlighted 
an experiment performed 
in his laboratory, where an 
individual was placed in an 
functional magnetic resource 
imaging (fMRI) scanner — 
which reads the brain’s neural 
activity — and shown stimuli, 
each consisting of an image 
and a one-word caption. By 
running various machine 
learning algorithms on the 
data, researchers can predict 
which neurons in the brain are 
activated when other types of 
stimuli are given. These mod-
els show that the similar words 
trigger similar brain activity in 
most individuals. Another ap-
plication of this model shows 
that in bilingual people, the 
same neurons are activated 
in the brain regardless of the 
language in which the word is 
presented.
Mitchell believes that the 
BRAIN initiative will generate 
a ?ood of data on brain activ-
ity while reading words. He 
feels that the “big opportu-
nity going forward [will be to 
generate] subtle and compre-
hensive models of language 
comprehension by using not 
just one experiment, but thou-
sands of experiments involv-
ing different people and dif-
ferent layouts.”
Nathan Urban, head of the 
biological sciences depart-
ment, discussed the role of 
individual neurons inside the 
brain. According to him, the 
main function of a neuron is 
“to perform an analog to digi-
tal conversion” of continuous 
sensory impulses to spikes 
called action potentials in the 
brain.
Urban said that research 
has shown that, although all 
the neurons in the brain per-
form similar functions, no two 
neurons are exactly similar 
and interchangeable in struc-
ture. Just as no two snow?akes 
have identical structures even 
though they follow the same 
hexagonal pattern, he ex-
plained, any given neuron is 
unique, even though it may 
look similar to other neurons. 
Urban also discussed how 
neurons function in brains of 
people with autism, and over-
viewed research being done 
in that area.
Psychology professor Mar-
lene Behrmann explained 
her research in neurological 
patterns behind facial recog-
nition. She pointed out that 
people tend to look at the up-
per part of the face longer 
than the lower part of the face. 
Thus, when images of faces 
are recreated based on the 
neural signals triggered in a 
person’s brain, the upper parts 
are more sharply focused than 
the lower. 
She also explained that 
people with congenital prosop-
agnosia, or face blindness, rely 
on clothing, voice and other 
external cues to identify oth-
ers. In severe cases, they may 
also be unable to recognize 
loved ones. Research con-
ducted in Behrmann’s labora-
tory has determined that, in 
such people, the fault lies in 
the propagation of the neural 
signals corresponding to facial 
recognition.
Emery Brown of Harvard 
University and the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology 
focused his talk on the activity 
within one’s brain while under 
anesthesia. Finally, the White 
House’s Of?ce of Science and 
Technology Policy spokesman 
Phillip Rubin presented infor-
mation on the BRAIN Initia-
tive itself and the policy deci-
sions that led to it.
Carnegie Mellon is poised 
to make a signi?cant contri-
bution as part of the BRAIN 
initiative. A successful part-
nership with the University of 
Pittsburgh — as manifested in 
the Center for the Neural Ba-
sis of Cognition — will make 
sure that Carnegie Mellon and 
Pittsburgh have an important 
role to play in the upcoming 
revolution in the ?eld of brain 
research.

Twitter, created in 2006, 
serves its purpose as a world-
wide social networking phe-
nomenon — but it’s also a 
useful resource for predicting 
the outcomes of events such as 
elections or movie premieres. 
Recent ?ndings by researchers 
at Carnegie Mellon show that 
Twitter analysis may also be 
able to help gamblers beat the 
spread on NFL games.
Christopher Dyer, assistant 
professor in Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Language Technologies 
Institute, led a research team 
in gathering tweets every 
15 minutes during football 
season, then distinguishing 
tweets that included hashtags 
associated with NFL teams. 
The goal of the research was 
to determine a correlation be-
tween tweets about a game and 
the outcome — speci?cally, 
which team will win and which 
team will beat the spread.
They found that, while 
Twitter data did not help de-
termine which team would 
win a game, it was about 56 
percent accurate with regards 
to beating the spread. They 
also discovered that increases 
in volume of tweets compared 
to a team’s baseline number 
of tweets corresponded with 
a loss. “It looks like people 
are tweeting when they are 
anxious,” Dyer said. “There is 
some kind of emotional thing 
going on.”
According to Dyer, sports 
betting works well with ma-
chine learning. In sports bet-
ting, bookies give a handicap 
to the team expected to lose, 
which is added onto that 
team’s score after the game’s 
completion. The bookies gen-
erally attempt to create the 
handicap so that the chances 
for each team to win will be 
50 percent, ensuring that they 
receive approximately the 
same number of bets for each 
team. If the team someone bet 
on has the higher score after 
the handicap has been added, 
they have beaten the spread.
Dyer explained that they 
assumed many people were 
betting illogically based on 
teams they liked, rather than 
which team was actually more 
likely to win. Optimistic versus 
pessimistic fan bases can also 
in?uence betting.
“The bookies know the dy-
namics of the two teams, so 
they are going to be setting 
the line in a slightly more fa-
vorable way to make money. 
If we can detect this kind of 
irrationality from a signal in 
social media, then maybe we 
can make money,” Dyer said. 
“Football is a great sport for 
this; the teams have national 
followings and the games are 
broadcast in national markets.” 
Football’s large sphere of in-
?uence was a major reason the 
team chose this sport for the 
research. It was also bene?-
cial that teams only play once 
a week — this made it easy to 
determine which games the 
tweets were referring to.
Dyer also commented on 
the bene?ts of using football 
from a scienti?c perspective.
“You have a lot of work on 
Twitter saying we can forecast 
elections, but elections come 
along every four years,” he ex-
plained. “In football we have 
140 games during the course 
of a season, so we get repli-
cated experiments.”
Although Twitter is con-
stantly developing, the main 
aspects of each game were the 
same, which allowed the re-
sults to be more scienti?cally 
relevant.
Despite promising conclu-
sions, the research had its 
limitations. “People are talk-
ing about games using all 
kinds of different words. It’s 
Twitter; people don’t even use 
typical, nice, edited English. 
Figuring out how to get a sig-
nal out of that was a big chal-
lenge in the research,” Dyer 
said. “We do a really naive 
categorization of the tweets.” 
The research didn’t sepa-
rate words into positive and 
negative, and tweets weren’t 
interpreted based on associa-
tions with how people speak. 
Each word in the tweets was 
treated individually, which 
caused some of the meaning to 
be lost. Dyer explains that the 
tweet “the Steelers beat the 
Eagles” was exactly the same 
as “the Eagles beat the Steel-
ers” based on the model.
“We haven’t found a way 
to beat Vegas,” Dyer said. “We 
still make a lot of mistakes.”
Despite the challenges, this 
research provides valuable in-
formation for future analysis 
of Twitter data and has the 
potential to increase the ac-
curacy with which we predict 
future events.

Imagine if every student 
in 15–110 had the oppor-
tunity to use his or her pro-
gramming skills to control 
robots. BirdBrain Technolo-
gies, a startup company that 
grew from Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Community Ro-
botics, Education and Tech-
nology Empowerment (CRE-
ATE) Lab is introducing 1,000 
robots to up to 20 school 
districts and educational or-
ganizations in an attempt 
to inspire and guide novice 
programmers in the world of 
computer science. The dis-
tribution of the robots will 
take place Dec. 8–14, during 
Computer Science Education 
Week (CSEdWeek).
The robot — known as the 
Finch — is a low-cost tabletop 
robot with bird-like features 
that has light, temperature, 
and obstacle sensors, along 
with an accelerometer that 
measures the direction the 
Finch tilts. The Finch also pos-
sesses simple components: 
Two motor-driven wheels, a 
buzzer, and a beak are pro-
grammed to light up in dif-
ferent colors. All these attri-
butes are manipulated by an 
input device similar to a Wii 
remote. Its most convenient 
feature is its over-15-foot USB 
cable, which eliminates the 
need for batteries and drives 
down costs. In addition, the 
robot supports a variety of 
major programming languag-
es.
Tom Lauwers, the creator 
of Finch and founder of Bird-
Brain Technologies, designed 
the Finch at the Carnegie 
Mellon’s CREATE Lab after 
his four-year research study 
as a Ph.D. student in the Ro-
botics Institute. The study 
ended in 2010 after the suc-
cessful development of a 
robot with a set of features 
optimized for computer sci-
ence education. Back in 2005, 
computer science programs 
and high school program-
ming classes were struggling 
with low enrollment and lack 
of interest from students; 
Lauwers aimed to increase 
student motivation in intro-
ductory classes by creating 
an appropriate learning tool. 
Since it went on the market 
two-and-a-half years ago, the 
Finch’s purpose has been to 
help students.
Despite the commercial 
success since the robot’s 
launch, Lauwers and his team 
faced challenges during de-
velopmental stages that dealt 
with deciding which features 
to include in the robot. For 
example, they originally de-
bated adding in a camera, but 
ditched the idea after real-
izing its added expenses and 
relatively small usefulness in 
a classroom setting.
Nonetheless, BirdBrain 
Technologies is now loaning 
out several hundred robots 
for an entire year because 
the company has received 
an overwhelming number 
of applicants and wanted to 
support more schools than 
the original plan allowed. 
The company estimates that 
the new program will allow 
15,000–30,000 students in 
roughly 50 school districts 
to have at least one hour of 
experience programming 
the Finch. BirdBrain Tech-
nologies explicitly requires 
that students have little or 
no experience programming 
robots; The company also fa-
vors schools that have a high 
number of low-income stu-
dents. It also only speci?cally 
serves students in grades four 
through nine. 
Although many educa-
tional systems seem to view 
computer science courses as 
high–school level electives, 
Lauwers regards them as core 
skills that should be learned 
earlier on in upper elemen-
tary school. He hopes that 
at least some of the students 
who program the Finch will 
take the initiative to use free 
programs such as Snap! and 
Scratch to independently 
study programming.
Lauwers must evaluate 
over 150 applications before 
this Friday and decide which 
ones are the most promis-
ing. Then, he needs to work 
with several stakeholders to 
develop activities for the ro-
bots for the teachers to use, 
and direct the warehouse 
that processes his company’s 
orders to deliver the robots. 
Before CSEdWeek, BirdBrain 
Technologies will send out 
?ve robots to each participat-
ing organization in November 
to allow teachers preparation 
time.
Although his focus is de?-
nitely on the Pittsburgh com-
munity, Lauwers sees himself 
as part of larger organization 
to promote computer science 
education.
“We want to support 
Computer Science Education 
Week’s Hour of Code initia-
tive, which seeks to demystify 
computer code with a one-
hour introductory activity for 
10 million students,” he said.

If you could drink from the 
Fountain of Youth, would you?
The idea of eternal, or even 
extended, life has been a divi-
sive issue since its conception. 
Are we meant to live for only 
a ?nite period of time? Is it 
moral to allow death to occur 
when it could be prevented? 
If humans take longer to pass 
away, where will we ?nd the 
space to house the world’s 
growing population? These 
are all questions that have 
different “correct” answers, 
depending on who’s talking. 
These discussions are taking 
on greater importance today 
as technology, science, and 
human ingenuity make it pos-
sible to achieve a substantially 
longer lifespan.
Last week, CEO of Google 
Larry Page announced the 
company’s next bold venture: 
?nding the cure to aging. 
Google is funding the creation 
of a startup research company, 
Calico, that aims to extend the 
lives of people born 20 years 
ago by 100 years. In a post on 
Google+, Page said, “There’s 
tremendous potential for 
technology more generally to 
improve people’s lives.” While 
Calico’s plan of action has not 
yet been publicized, there are 
many existing technologies 
and methods that could po-
tentially be expanded upon 
to produce signi?cant results. 
One such method that shows 
promise is called telomerase 
gene therapy.
Telomeres are essentially 
shields made out of nucleo-
tide base pairs that are placed 
at the ends of every chromo-
some in animal cells to protect 
DNA from erosion during cell 
division. Each telomere loses 
base pairs every time the cell 
divides, which may cause the 
phenomena of aging. After 
telomeres deteriorate to a cer-
tain length, the DNA is no lon-
ger protected; the cell ceases 
to divide and consequently 
dies. However, some cells in 
the body, such as adult stem 
cells, have shown to express 
a protein called telomerase 
that prevents telomeres from 
degrading. Recent research 
conducted at the Spanish Na-
tional Cancer Research Center 
has shown that treating mice 
with telomerase increases the 
length of their life by up to 40 
percent. Calico could poten-
tially expand on telomerase re-
search by further investigating 
its effectiveness and by ?nding 
ways to safely and effectively 
administer it to humans.
Another approach — one 
currently being researched 
at Carnegie Mellon — looks 
at how organisms tend to ex-
press genes in different ways 
as they age. Javier Lopez, as-
sociate professor of biological 
sciences at Carnegie Mellon, 
is looking at these differential 
expressions and investigat-
ing if waste produced by the 
cell plays a role. As cells pro-
duce energy to carry out the 
processes of life, destructive 
compounds are created that 
accumulate in cells. Lopez has 
been able to link this buildup 
with changes in gene expres-
sion that correlate to aging. 
Removing or limiting the ef-
fects of this byproduct could 
lead to insight into another 
form of life extension.
Page said, “[We] are ex-
cited about tackling aging and 
illness. These issues affect us 
all — from the decreased mo-
bility and mental agility that 
comes with age, to life-threat-
ening diseases that exact a ter-
rible physical and emotional 
toll on individuals and fami-
lies. And while this is clearly 
a longer-term bet, we believe 
we can make good progress 
within reasonable timescales 
with the right goals and the 
right people.”
While some believe Calico 
has good intentions, others be-
lieve that extending the length 
of human lives is not the right 
answer. Many contend that 
the resources required for this 
undertaking would be better 
spent protecting the environ-
ment or reducing poverty and 
hunger. 
Additionally, life extension 
means that there will be an 
even greater increase in the 
population after each succes-
sive generation. This could po-
tentially lead to a shortage of 
resources on Earth.
“Death, even though it can 
be sad and painful, is an un-
avoidable and necessary pro-
cess of life,” ?rst-year business 
major Sonali Avlani said. “I’m 
not saying that ?nding cures to 
diseases like cancer and AIDS 
is a bad thing. However, we 
simply don’t have the resourc-
es to sustain longer lives. We 
are already overpopulating 
the Earth.”
As of now, it is no longer a 
question of if we can live lon-
ger; it’s just a question of if we 
want to.

Breast cancer campaigns not praiseworthy
October is Breast Cancer Aware-
ness Month. Breast cancer is a na-
tional threat to women and men that 
deserves care and consideration, but 
it may not necessitate as much atten-
tion as various awareness founda-
tions have given it compared to other 
conditions.
Issue awareness has gained pop-
ularity in the age of the Internet, 
but awareness often promotes little 
change. Breast cancer awareness has 
become more of a commercial asset 
than a movement, according to The 
Guardian, with companies placing 
pink ribbons on products to appear 
socially conscious. 
However, this lack of true action 
is not the biggest problem of the 
breast cancer awareness campaign; 
it’s disturbing side is its sexualization 
of women’s health. 
sOne of breast cancer awareness’s 
most famous slogans is “Save the 
Boobs,” which appeared in a breast 
cancer awareness advertisement cre-
ated by Canadian TV Host and MTV 
host Aliya-Jasmine Sovani. Breast 
cancer gets some of its attention be-
cause it deals with women’s breasts 
— and sex sells. This sort of market-
ing subtly implies that the breasts are 
the part of a woman that are most 
worth saving — not her brain, nor  
her  heart. 
Even more telling is that prostate 
cancer does not bene?t from this in-
tensi?ed focus on a disease that af-
fects sexual or sexualized organs. 
According to The Daily Caller, breast 
cancer receives far more funding 
than prostate cancer; breast cancer 
research received $872 million in 
federal funding while prostate can-
cer research received only $390 mil-
lion in 2009. Yet, the American Can-
cer Society expects similar numbers 
of new cases in 2013  — 234,580 new 
cases of breast cancer and 238,590 
new cases of prostate cancer.
Breast cancer isn’t even the big-
gest threat to women’s health — 
heart disease is, followed by lung 
cancer, according to The Huf?ngton 
Post. So then why is it that heart dis-
ease doesn’t receive the same atten-
tion that breast cancer does?
Breast cancer is a potentially le-
thal disease that certainly deserves 
attention in funding, but not more 
so than equally dangerous diseases; 
and creating a sexualized campaign, 
although effective, is not admirable.
Editorial Dissent
Michael Setzer, SciTech Editor
Breast cancer campaigns have 
absolutely no reason to sti?e their 
voices. Furthermore, the assumption 
that a decrease in pushing breast 
cancer awareness will lead to an in-
crease in knowledge of other diseas-
es is fallacious.
It seems obvious that the term 
awareness refers to education of sta-
tistics regarding the disease, preven-
tative measures, and testing avail-
able to women. 
According to CBS News, the over-
whelming majority of fatal breast 
cancers occur in women who have 
not had a mammogram.
According to health and medi-
cine website Medscape, the survival 
rate of breast cancer has greatly in-
creased in the past 10 years. 
New treatments and early detec-
tion — both of which can be at least 
partially attributed to successful 
breast cancer campaigns — are main 
reasons behind increased treatment 
and survival.
The initiatives taken by organiza-
tions such as Susan G. Komen for the 
Cure are admirable and smart. As 
other organizations show, it’s very 
dif?cult to raise money and promote 
awareness and education about the 
disease in question. 
Breast cancer awareness advo-
cates have created successful cam-
paigns that have ultimately led to 
signi?cant results; why should we 
fault them on this?
Fold ethics hearing board or give it power
One would think Pittsburgh’s eth-
ics hearing board would have more 
to do. When Mayor Luke Ravenstahl 
overhauled the city’s ethics code 
in 2009, hopes were high that the 
board would provide government 
transparency and regulate ethics 
on a level that Pittsburgh had never 
seen before — and although the eth-
ics board had been around before 
2009, it was then revitalized and 
made itself known in order to uphold 
these new doctrines.
Today, the board struggles to 
determine its purpose, with no 
help from the rest of the city’s 
government.
The ?ve-person board has shrunk 
to two people, as the mayor failed to 
appoint his own members or approve 
those nominated by City Council. 
According to the 2009 legisla-
tion, city employees must disclose 
gifts they receive that are over $100 
on a designated website — but since 
2009, only one such divulgence was 
made. The board is supposed to hold 
annual ethics training sessions for 
many city employees, but none has 
been held since 2010. The board’s 
“website,” which is only a small sub-
space on the mayor’s own site, says 
“Meetings are held, as scheduled 
below, at 10:00 a.m....” There are no 
meetings listed.
If members of Pittsburgh’s gov-
ernment think that the board is in-
effective, then they should disband 
it. If they think it could stand to do 
some good with proper direction 
and power, they should give it legal 
representation and more in?uence. 
The worst possible action is the one 
they’re making now: to shirk respon-
sibility and let the ethics board fall 
into disrepair.
Why Ravenstahl would push for 
the ethics board’s restoration and 
then not appoint or approve new 
members is anyone’s guess. As it 
stands, though, the board has noth-
ing to do and no one to do it. Accord-
ing to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 
the Pittsburgh City Law Department 
takes care of most cases on ethics, 
and the ethics board doesn’t have its 
own attorney even if it wanted to get 
involved.
Yes, Ravenstahl is getting ready 
to leave — but he and the rest of the 
city council should ?nish what they 
started when they revitalized the 
city’s ethics board.

A beginner’s guide to replacing Obamacare
KYLE HENSON
The House GOP is currently in-
tent on defunding the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act, 
more commonly known as Obam-
acare. Obamacare will likely remain 
funded and intact through this cri-
sis, but the fact remains that it is an 
awful piece of legislation that should 
be replaced. In order to understand 
how to replace Obamacare, we must 
?rst understand what de?ciencies 
our healthcare system had before 
Obamacare’s passage, and what de-
?ciencies Obamacare itself has.
Obamacare was created to pro-
tect those who were disenfranchised 
by the current system, and make 
healthcare generally more afford-
able. These are noble goals, and 
they underscore two main prob-
lems with our healthcare system 
pre-Obamacare. There were a lot 
of people who couldn’t get health 
insurance, such as those with pre-
existing conditions, as well as those 
who didn’t get health insurance 
through their employers and were 
unable to afford it themselves. Ad-
ditionally, sometimes people’s insur-
ance failed to cover the scope of their 
problems and they were left with ex-
orbitant out-of-pocket costs. These 
problems can be summed up sim-
ply: Sometimes people who needed 
healthcare couldn’t get it, but most 
people who needed healthcare were 
getting it under the old system.
Obamacare tries to solve these 
problems by making everyone get 
health insurance that covers a wid-
er range of problems, so that there 
would be more money in the system. 
The legislation also eliminates some 
of the ways that providers change 
their prices, so that those with pre-
existing conditions could get insur-
ance. Additionally, it provides a 
marketplace with subsidies for those 
who cannot afford insurance to get 
healthcare. Finally, it regulates em-
ployers so that they have to offer 
more insurance to more people.
These provisions sound great, 
but Obamacare has a lot of unin-
tended consequences. To pay for the 
subsidies, taxes are increasing on 
health savings accounts and medical 
devices, which increases the overall 
cost of healthcare. Employers are 
cutting employees’ hours because 
they cannot afford to give part-time 
employees insurance. Young people 
are being forced to buy plans that 
cover far more than they need, in-
creasing their premiums drastically. 
As a result, many people may pay 
the cheaper ?ne rather than get cov-
erage. This will eliminate the crux 
of Obamacare, which is a massive 
redistribution of wealth from young, 
healthy people to old, sick people.
So, given that both systems are 
?awed, the best way to augment the 
pre-Obamacare system is to have the 
government cover preventative and 
catastrophic care. This sounds so-
cialistic — and it is — but the most 
ef?cient insurance scheme is one 
that involves everyone. Taxes can 
be adjusted to progressively cover 
this system, but we are moving into 
a society where healthcare is being 
considered a right. As such, we need 
to begin to work it into our govern-
ment. This proposed system could 
additionally replace Medicare and 
Medicaid to work more ef?ciently.
This proposed system’s bene?ts 
are numerous. First, covering pre-
ventative care lowers overall costs 
because diseases with high costs in 
later stages are caught sooner. There 
are elements of this tactic in Obam-
acare, but we need to embrace this 
ef?cient tactic fully. Finally, most 
health insurance horror stories come 
from catastrophic care. If the gov-
ernment covers catastrophic care, 
there will be no hitting limits to 
coverage with stage four cancer or 
other debilitating diseases that give 
the pre-Obamacare system a bad 
name. This proposed system also 
gives consumers the ability to shop 
around for insurance for things like 
a broken ?nger or strep throat. This 
system keeps costs down for routine 
diseases and procedures, but takes 
care of everyone in the event that 
something seriously bad happens.
This potential system is far more 
ef?cient than pre-Obamacare and 
Obamacare because it maintains the 
bene?ts of a market system, while 
taking care of everyone that needs 
to be taken care of. It will be a tough 
sell to America, but to ensure a fu-
ture of happy, healthy, and prosper-
ous citizens, this proposal is the right 
move for our healthcare system.

Media glamour explains mass killings
BRANDON SCHMUCK
Junior Staffwriter
According to a recent article in 
The Economist, the United States is 
facing a strange trend: Gun violence 
has been decreasing overall, but the 
number of mass shootings has been 
increasing. In the past 20 years, 
deaths from mass shootings have 
risen from less than 0.05 per 1 mil-
lion people to over 0.22. While this 
number is still small enough that 
Americans have no reason to panic 
when going to theaters or sending 
their children to school, this rise in 
the rate of mass shooting deaths re-
veals that there is most certainly an 
underlying problem.
For those who have never been 
exposed to guns, it is hard to imagine 
a world where everyone owns one, 
and to understand what purpose 
guns carry. However, according to 
a Gallup Poll conducted in October 
2011, 47 percent of American adults 
own at least one ?rearm. Despite the 
fact that this is the highest rate since 
1993, The Economist points out that 
gun crimes have been cut in half over 
the past 20 years, from around seven 
homicides per 100,000 people to 3.6. 
To state that gun ownership is direct-
ly related to violent crimes makes no 
sense at all, as the correlation be-
tween them appears to be negative.
One explanation for this increase 
in mass shootings is far from hid-
den. In fact, it stares in the face of 
Americans every time they pick up 
a newspaper or turn on the news: 
the glamorization of mass shooters. 
News media networks are publiciz-
ing these criminals like never before. 
If one began a conversation with a 
random person on the street regard-
ing a recent mass shooting, chances 
are that person would be easily able 
to name the shooter but would strug-
gle to name even one of their victims.
One particularly disturbing ex-
ample of news glamorization was 
the Aug. 1 edition of Rolling Stone. 
On its cover was a close-up of the 
Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar 
Tsarnaev, staring from the page like 
a celebrity that deserved the public 
eye. 
Many Americans were outraged. 
Boston Mayor Thomas Menino re-
sponded in a letter to Rolling Stone, 
stating that the cover sends the mes-
sage that “destruction gains fame for 
killers and their ‘causes.’” His words, 
according to CNN, summarized the 
feelings of many: “The survivors of 
the Boston attacks deserve Rolling 
Stone cover stories, though I no lon-
ger feel that Rolling Stone deserves 
them.”
Sadly, however, U.S. News & 
World Report says that putting this 
homicidal maniac on its cover in-
creased the sales of Rolling Stone by 
102 percent. Therefore, media com-
panies alone cannot take the blame, 
as they are merely delivering the 
content that Americans wish to con-
sume. These crimes will only contin-
ue to increase until Americans would 
rather read the stories of those who 
lost their lives in mass shootings, in-
stead of the stories of the culprits be-
hind these unspeakable crimes.
Taking away the guns of the other 
99 percent of Americans that are 
mentally stable enough not to carry 
a ?rearm into a school or mall will do 
nothing. As such, the recent increase 
in mass shootings is not as simple of 
an issue as gun control. It is as com-
plex as society, and it reveals the 
true problem that Americans would 
rather read about the people who 
massacre than those who attempt to 
save the victims.
Online textbooks don’t  aid student education
JUSTIN YAN
Junior Staffwriter
Last year, when I attended high 
school at Phillips Academy outside 
of Boston, the math and econom-
ics department made moves toward 
using online textbooks and online 
homework assignments. This trend 
of going online — with the sugges-
tion that online learning is superior 
to traditional learning — seems to 
have continued into college.
To be blunt, online textbooks are 
counterproductive, inconvenient 
trash. What’s even worse? Online 
homework. Scrap convenience. 
Scrap accessibility. Online read-
ing and homework just isn’t work-
ing well for me, and I’m sure it isn’t 
working for many other college stu-
dents out there. Online homework 
does not improve the academic ex-
perience or performance, and a re-
version to traditional pen and paper 
would probably help students learn 
better.
There are, of course, some advan-
tages that come along with online 
textbooks. They save paper. There’s 
no denying the good that saving 
paper does. Online learning also al-
lows all textbooks to be centralized 
in one Internet browser. Third, they 
come with interactive features. Stu-
dents can take notes on their com-
puters, all of which can be saved 
and accessed digitally. Students can 
quiz themselves and watch videos 
about concepts they have trouble 
comprehending. If students are 
susceptible to losing homework as-
signments, like myself, online hubs 
allow students to keep them in one, 
easy place. Lastly, online learning 
should, in theory, be a lot cheaper. 
Textbook companies are supporting 
a server, not printing thousands of 
textbooks.
It all sounds wonderful. Right? 
My professors seem to think so. Out 
of the four textbook-based classes 
I am taking this semester, three 
use some form of online textbook 
or homework assignments. Many 
introductory math classes require 
WebAssign. Principles of Economics 
requires Aplia.
Colleges seem to think online 
textbooks are wonderful too: Digital 
textbooks may make up more than 
11 percent of textbook revenue in 
the United States this year, accord-
ing to senior analyst Kathy Micky of 
Simba Information in The New York 
Times.
This should all be good news. For 
subjects like chemistry, mathemat-
ics, and economics, however, on-
line homework is frustrating. There 
is practically no room to take notes 
in the margins of readings. Need an 
answer? There’s no option to keep 
your ?nger on the answer page to 
check if you’re right after ?nishing 
problems. All of that is now within 
the depths of a computer screen. 
The formula is 20 clicks away, and 
answers are almost impossible to re-
trieve without opening a second tab 
— probably another 20 clicks.
WebAssign is a classic example 
of how counterproductive online 
learning can be. For multiple-choice 
questions, it’s easy to click random 
buttons and achieve perfect scores. 
While this random clicking is a mar-
ginal blessing for QPAs and stress 
levels, students do not actually learn 
— they guess.
 The fact that WebAssign and 
Aplia spit out ticks and crosses for 
correctness encourages students to 
become complacent. The answers 
don’t come back with a teacher or 
professor’s feedback. The website 
won’t explain what’s wrong, where 
students made mistakes, or how 
they can improve. Yes, there are of-
?ce hours, but professors see stu-
dents’ progress through a computer 
screen of scores, and not by the way 
they solve problems.
In the 21st century, where iPads 
can access thousands of books 
through several touches, online 
homework seems to be the next logi-
cal step, and maybe it is. But online 
learning needs to be reformatted so 
that it preserves all the advantages 
of paper, along with the advantages 
that the Internet and multimedia 
bring. The same needs to be applied 
to online textbooks to make their 
use more ?uid. 
I would rather break my back 
lugging around textbooks than pay-
ing nearly the same amount for ac-
cess to a website that won’t give me 
the same quality education.
Twitter will conquer IPO, diversify
ABHISHEK TAYAL
Junior Staffwriter
Back in 2006, Twitter started as a 
side project by founder Jack Dorsey 
as a hedge against his dormant start-
up Odeo. Fast forward seven years, 
and Twitter has become one of the 
biggest names in social media. Along 
with Facebook, Twitter brought the 
very notion of social networking 
to the masses. Some sources, like 
telegraph.co.uk, estimate that Twit-
ter has 200 million active users. In a 
couple of months, Twitter will face 
its biggest challenge yet — the infa-
mous initial public offering (IPO).
At worst, IPOs can destroy com-
panies; at best, they can bring about 
signi?cant change in company 
culture. The prospect of quarterly 
earnings, shareholder pressure, and 
activist investors can paralyze an or-
ganization and shift its focus away 
from innovating on its core platform. 
Just look at Facebook to see how 
painful an IPO can be. Facebook has 
had an incredibly rocky ?rst year as 
a public company. Its stock dropped 
to below half its IPO price in August 
according to The Huf?ngton Post, 
and Facebook is still trading at a 
price not much above its IPO price. 
Won’t Twitter be affected in the same 
way that Facebook has been?
Twitter is well-positioned to avoid 
these pitfalls and emerge as a health-
ier, more diverse company following 
a public offering.
One of the primary reasons Face-
book’s stock tumbled is that it didn’t 
have a credible revenue model for 
mobile devices a year ago. Know-
ing how to monetize mobile capa-
bilities is of paramount importance 
for an Internet company, since the 
majority of future growth in the 
technology industry will come from 
smartphones and tablets running 
operating systems like iOS and An-
droid. Twitter, on the other hand, has 
been monetizing mobile capabilities 
for as long as it has been ?nancially 
viable. This year, mobile advertise-
ments are expected to account for 55 
percent of Twitter’s revenue, accord-
ing to Mediabistro.com. In fact, Twit-
ter was originally conceived as a mo-
bile platform that allowed users to 
use text messages to tell groups what 
they were doing. In other words, 
Twitter’s future is far more secure 
than Facebook’s was one year ago.
Another large difference between 
Facebook and Twitter’s IPOs has 
more to do with the IPOs themselves. 
Facebook’s IPO was highly publicized 
— one of the most hyped IPOs in his-
tory. Facebook also set a relatively 
high initial IPO price of $38. The 
impending Twitter IPO is a decidedly 
lower key affair. The announcement 
was made, in characteristic fashion, 
through a tweet: “We’ve con?den-
tially submitted an S-1 to the S.E.C. 
for a planned IPO.” Through this 
ingenious move, Twitter announced 
that it planned to go public while 
withholding every other detail about 
the IPO. Goldman Sachs will under-
write the offering, according to The 
Wall Street Journal, and the stock 
will be priced and executed to have 
shareholder appreciation, thus side-
stepping Facebook’s most signi?cant 
IPO ?ub. By not setting any public 
expectations from its IPO, Twitter 
avoids public disappointment.
Most importantly, an IPO is a 
foundation for the company Twitter 
wants to be tomorrow. If it is to con-
tinue to grow at the rate it has, Twit-
ter needs to ramp up investment in 
its future products. The best way to 
generate that kind of cash is through 
an IPO. 
Twitter today is a social network 
for personal use. Twitter tomorrow 
is a global, real-time news and enter-
tainment network centered around 
its core platform, but with a variety 
of other successful products includ-
ing Twitter Music and Vine, as well 
as products under development in 
markets, including local discovery 
and TV advertising.
Will the IPO be a disaster, or will 
it be a much needed catalyst to en-
ter new markets? Although nobody 
knows, I’d wager my money on the 
latter.

Heat’s on as UAA soccer play starts 
WILLIAM PARK
Sports Editor
After mastering non-con-
ference opponents, both the 
men’s and women’s soccer 
teams look ready to move on 
to tougher competition when 
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) Conference play 
starts Saturday. 
“[Conference play is] 
much more competitive. We 
don’t have a conference tour-
nament so every game is like 
a championship game,” said 
men’s head coach Arron Lu-
jan. 
With the men’s team at 
7–1–1 and the women’s at 
6–1–1, the two teams have 
followed similar paths to this 
point. 
Early in the season, both 
teams were clearly outplay-
ing their opponents, though 
they were struggling to put 
the ball in the net.
The men’s team won each 
of its ?rst ?ve victories of the 
season with scores of 1–0.
“It took our forwards and 
mid?elders a little while to 
get in a ?ow with each other. 
The past couple of games, 
we’ve been ?ring on all cylin-
ders,” said senior captain Ben 
Bryant. 
Over the past three games, 
the men’s squad has scored a 
total of nine goals. While se-
niors Max Tassano and Chris 
Wysocki have led the way 
with totals of ?ve and four 
goals respectively, ?rst-year 
mid?elder Tristan Lockwood 
has emerged as a somewhat 
surprising presence.
Lockwood, who has start-
ed eight of the nine games 
after senior mid?elder Scott 
Gerfen suffered a season-
ending leg injury, has totaled 
two goals and two assists so 
far. 
“The upperclassmen have 
really accepted me, and made 
it easier for me to transition 
into an important playing 
role,” Lockwood said.
“Tristan comes from a 
good club team. I’m not that 
surprised [at his success].... 
He’s taken that opportunity 
and done a really good job 
with it,” Lujan said. 
Ranked No. 15 in Division 
III, the women’s only loss 
of the season came against 
Johns Hopkins University, 
now ranked the No. 2 team in 
the country, in a game which 
the Tartans brie?y led 2–0 
before conceding three goals 
in a row. 
“We know we are one of 
the best teams in the coun-
try, and we can play with 
one of the best teams in the 
country,” said women’s head 
coach Yon Struble. 
So far, the team has con-
vincingly handled its weaker 
non-conference opponents, 
keeping possession in the 
opponent’s half and using 
its speed and athleticism to 
create many goal-scoring 
opportunities.
Though they have strug-
gled with their ?nishing 
touch, they scored four goals 
in their victory over Juniata 
College last Wednesday. 
Asked if he was satis?ed 
with his team’s goal-scoring, 
Struble was direct. “No. We 
always want to score more 
goals.” 
Despite a rotating starting 
three up front, many players 
have stepped up, showing 
the team’s depth. Junior mid-
?elder Amanda So started 
the season strong with three 
goals in the ?rst three games, 
and ?ve of her teammates 
have scored two or more 
goals. 
The return of senior for-
ward Alex Venegas from a 
preseason knee injury should 
also strengthen the women’s 
team’s attack. 
Although the start of UAA 
play brings tougher play — 
“The games are battles,” 
Struble said — both teams 
are looking forward to the 
competition. 
“I think the team looks 
great, and we’re all feeling 
really con?dent and pumped 
to go,” said graduate student 
goalkeeper Anna Albi.
At stake for both teams 
is the automatic bid into the 
NCAA tournament given to 
the conference winner. 
“I’m excited. I think we 
can win the UAA this year,” 
Bryant said. 
The UAA conference is so 
highly competitive and ?elds 
so many great teams, how-
ever, that many of them earn 
at-large bids into the tourna-
ment anyway. Teams that ?n-
ish third or fourth in the con-
ference can earn bids into the 
tournament. 
“It’s such a competitive 
conference, and every team 
could win on any given day,” 
Struble said.
Both teams will play all 
seven other teams in their 
conferences once, starting 
this Saturday when both the 
University of Chicago men’s 
and women’s teams visit 
Pittsburgh. 
The men will kick off ?rst 
at 11:00 a.m. followed by the 
women at 1:30 p.m. 
Last season, the men’s 
team lost in the second round 
of the NCAA tournament, 
while the women’s team lost 
in heartbreaking fashion in 
the quarter?nals on penalty 
kicks. 
“We know that we’re kind 
of a new team, and we’re 
slowly but surely making new 
memories,” Albi said.
ATHLETE PROFILE
Ali Celentano is bringing the heat to the volleyball courts
KARTHIK NAGALINGAM
Junior Staffwriter
Since coming to campus in 
fall 2011, junior business ad-
ministration major Ali Celen-
tano has been a driving force 
on the volleyball court and 
is always pushing for new 
challenges.
From Mission Viejo, Calif., 
Celentano played a variety 
of sports growing up, most 
notably soccer. She also tried 
basketball due to her height 
— she is 6’0” — but found she 
didn’t have a true passion for 
it.
Celentano’s love for vol-
leyball actually started late, 
during her ?rst year of high 
school.
“[I] tried out because I was 
tall, and it looked fun,” she 
said.
She started to study and 
learn the game, progressing to 
new heights. 
With the advice of her high 
school coach, she joined a club 
team to further develop her 
skills.
During a recruiting tourna-
ment in Las Vegas her junior 
year of high school, she was 
approached by the current 
head coach of the Carnegie 
Mellon volleyball team, Kim 
Kelly. 
This was also the ?rst time 
Celentano had ever heard of 
Carnegie Mellon.
Two years later, she would 
become a business administra-
tion major with a minor in bi-
ology, join the team, and now, 
she is positioned to join Carn-
egie Mellon’s top 10 leaders in 
kills.
With 893 career kills and 
246 for the season, she needs 
195 more kills to crack the top 
10.
Celentano’s friend Adrian 
Botta, a junior statistics major 
who watched her team’s home 
3–0 victory over Frostburg 
State University last Tuesday, 
said, “Ali plays for hours on 
end, rarely getting a sub, and 
always has to run between 
practice and classes, but she 
is always walking around with 
a smile and a great, relaxed 
attitude.”
“However, the second the 
whistle blows and the ball is in 
the air, she is de?nitely hitting 
it down as hard as she can. 
That is when she gets all that 
energy out,” Botta said.
Celentano’s said that her 
favorite part of volleyball is 
“the excitement — the way the 
momentum can ebb-and-?ow 
after every single point.”
“The most rewarding thing 
that I have gotten from vol-
leyball is the camaraderie 
of the girls, the trust in my 
teammates and coaches, and 
the teamwork skills I have ac-
quired,” she said.
Celentano has a variety of 
goals for this season, both per-
sonal and team-oriented. She 
wants to reach 1,000 career 
kills by the end of the season 
— she needs 107 more — a 
distinction she wishes to share 
with teammate, senior Senna 
Parsa.
She also wants to have an-
other successful year and have 
the team reach the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
playoffs.
“The most exciting games 
are the UAA’s. We get to play 
the best teams in our confer-
ence and [the games] are 
always very competitive,” 
Celentano said.
Her team, with a 15–4 re-
cord, sits third in the UAA Con-
ference and will get to show its 
mettle when it heads to Cleve-
land this Saturday for the ?rst 
UAA round-robin tournament.
“We are all looking forward 
to the ?rst UAA round-robin,” 
Celentano said.
After a 3–6 conference re-
cord last season, Celentano 
hopes for a better result this 
year. 
Whatever the outcome, 
however, Celentano will sure-
ly play a large role in bringing  
the Tartans closer to victory.
Tartans defeat Tornadoes at Cèilidh
GABRIELLE WEST
Staffwriter
The Tartans celebrat-
ed their Homecoming 
game by defeating the 
Geneva College Gold-
en Tornadoes 34–27 
in a double overtime 
thriller on Saturday. The 
Tartans are now 2–2 after 
handing Geneva their ?rst 
loss of the season.
Geneva jumped on the 
scoreboard ?rst, scoring 
a touchdown on a four-
yard pass for a quick 
7–0 lead.
The Tartans stormed 
back, driving 63 yards 
down the ?eld to tie the 
score at seven. Sopho-
more running back Max 
Reinertsen spearheaded 
the drive with a run of 23 
yards and another of 22 
yards. Senior quarterback 
Rob Kalkstein’s ?rst 
completed pass of 
the day — a two-
yard pass to senior 
wide receiver Tim 
Kikta — ?nished 
the touchdown drive.
The second quarter be-
gan with success for Carn-
egie Mellon as Kalkstein 
found junior wide receiver 
Tim Swanson for a 56-yard 
run down the sideline. Just 
three plays later, Kalkstein 
scored on a ?ve-yard scam-
per for their ?rst lead of the 
day, 14–7. Two ?eld goals by 
the Golden Tornadoes and a 
15-yard pass from Kalkstein 
to Reinertsen ended the ?rst 
half with a score of 21–13.
The Golden Tornadoes 
opened the scoring in the 
second half after a 15-yard 
touchdown pass. Geneva 
tried for a two-point conver-
sion, but was unsuccessful, 
leaving the score at 21–19. 
Just before the end of the 
quarter, Kalkstein complet-
ed a touchdown pass to 
senior tight end Bryce 
Pardoe advancing the score 
to 27–19. The Tartans’ extra 
point attempt was blocked 
— a key development that 
kept Geneva within one 
possession.
With just under three 
minutes left in the fourth 
quarter, the Golden Tor-
nadoes completed another 
touchdown and were suc-
cessful this time with the 
two-point conversion tying 
the score at 27.
Kalkstein’s pass, the 
team’s chance for a game-
winning drive, was promptly 
intercepted. This gave Gene-
va an opportunity for their 
own game-winning drive 
starting at the Carnegie 
Mellon 45-yard line. The 
Tartans’ defense was unable 
to stop the Geneva 
advance, however, and 
the Golden Tornadoes were 
set up for a game-winning 
?eld goal from the Tartans’ 
18-yard line. Fortunately for 
the Tartans, the Geneva ?eld 
goal attempt failed.
The ?rst overtime started 
well for the Golden Torna-
does, who scored a touch-
down after just three plays. 
The Tartans responded well 
again as Reinertsen found 
himself in the end zone after 
a three-yard pass from Kalk-
stein.
Double overtime began 
with the Tartans on offense 
?rst, and they scored in just 
?ve plays: Reinertsen com-
pleted his third touchdown 
of the day so the Tartans 
could take the 
lead, rush-
ing into the end zone from 
six yards out. 
Geneva College failed 
to complete four passes in 
a row, and senior Tartan 
defensive backs Jack But-
ler and Liam McGrath each 
racked up a pass breakup on 
third and fourth down, se-
curing the Tartan victory.
“It was de?nitely one of 
the greatest games I’ve ever 
played in, and it was the ?rst 
time that we seemed like one 
team. This game de?nitely 
gave us a big boost in mo-
rale moving forward,” Butler 
said.
The Tartans will hit the 
road next Saturday when 
they play St. Vincent College 
at 1 p.m. in Latrobe, Pa.

S’n’S holds charity cabaret
Show features student interpretations of classic works
Scotch’n’Soda Theatre held its sixth Annual 
Charity Cabaret on Friday night. In two hours, the 
show covered 22 performances in two acts and an 
intermission. Most of the songs were snipped out of 
musical theater shows, but were accessible enough 
to enjoy without exposition. All proceeds from the 
cabaret went toward the Alumni Theater Company, 
a nonprofit theater in Pittsburgh which, according 
to its website, “provides quality performing arts 
training for talented, committed youth in grades 
6–12 in a highly creative, challenging, and 
supportive environment.”
The show opened with all of the performers singing 
“The Sixth Annual Charity Cabaret,” a rendition of 
“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” from 
the one-act musical comedy of the same title, with 
the lyrics tweaked to fit the occasion. Afterward, 
each of the singers performed individually or in pairs 
before coming together again for a group finale.
One of the most interesting parts of the show was 
hearing student reinterpretations of songs that 
are usually sung by professionals, like junior voice 
major Zachary Mendez’s performance of the popular 
Phantom of the Opera number, “Music of the Night.” 
Some performers added a great deal of personality 
to their songs, like junior psychology major Jaclyn 
Ross, who gave an energetic performance in her 
version of “Joey Is a Punk Rocker” from The Black 
Suits, a song about a straight-laced girl who is in 
love with a punk rock boy. Though most performers 
only used their voices, junior chemical engineering 
major Alex Petti brought his guitar to strum along 
as he sang “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” from 
Jersey Boys.
In addition to Carnegie Mellon students, members 
of the Alumni Theater Company also came to 
perform the song “A Step Too Far” from their recent 
production of the musical Aida.
Sophomore vocal performance major Shannyn 
Rinker’s soulful rendition of the classic song, “Blues 
in the Night” was simply a show-stopper. Singing 
with her body language as well as with voice, Rinker 
gave the air of an old-time lounge singer, like Billie 
Holiday or Ella Fitzgerald.
In her performance of “Part of Your World” from The 
Little Mermaid, Abby Botnick, a senior Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts student in costume design 
and professional writing, made quite the entrance; 
she was carried out decked in full mermaid regalia 
— tail, seashells, fork-comb, and all. Throughout the 
song, unable to walk, Botnick hopped around in her 
mermaid costume and had to be carried out when 
the song was finished.
Junior voice major Taylor Rawley performed “Mr. 
Cellophane” from Chicago, a sadly humorous song 
about a man who nobody notices. Rawley did a 
small but hilarious dance number to go along with 
the tone of the song, in which he desperately waved 
around jazz hands and did an feeble one-man 
kickline to make people notice him.
Of special mention was the emcee — junior 
chemical engineering major and Scotch’n’Soda 
vice president Evan Starkweather — who provided 
warm, friendly humor in the small breaks between 
the performances, as well as the pit musicians, 
whose presence and live musical performances gave 
the songs a much more vibrant sound.
The show was very charming overall; with plenty of 
talented performers and wonderful music, the show 
was a great Cèilidh Weekend event, and hopefully a 
tradition that will continue in future years.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Ryan & Matt,
I’m noticing more and 
more small, happy-
looking people around 
campus, and they’re 
really annoying. They’re 
traveling in groups and 
holding up the lines at 
Entropy+ and Resnik, 
and just look like a bunch 
of lost, ignorant sheep. 
What are these things and 
what’s the best way of 
dealing with them?
Sincerely,
People-like Entities 
Strolling Through 
Passively, Rather 
Outrageously Blithe, 
Likely Enemies of Mine
Dear PEST PROBLEM,
These “things” as you put 
it are, in fact, people. You 
probably looked like one 
not too long ago yourself. 
These people are colloquially 
referred to as “freshmen” 
— or, to be more politically 
correct, “freshpersons.” 
Even though they’ve been 
here over a month, some 
of them will cling to their 
carefree, blissfully unaware 
state they assume upon 
entering university.
The only cure is time. They 
will slowly lose their happy-
go-lucky attitudes — which 
is kinda sad, but it’s the 
natural order of things. The 
best thing you can do in 
the meantime is help them 
along and teach them the 
secret arts of surviving at 
Carnegie Mellon. Just don’t 
be surprised when there’s a 
whole new crop of “things” 
next fall.
It’s the circle of life,
Matt & Ryan
Dear Ryan & Matt,
I’m getting tired of 
bridges in this city. Don’t 
get me wrong; I love 
Carnegie Mellon, but I 
just need a change of 
venue, maybe just for a 
semester. 
Sincerely, 
Take Relaxing Adventures 
Via Exploiting Laudable 
Educational Reasons
Dear TRAVELER,
Have you considered 
studying abroad in Venice? I 
hear there are fewer bridges 
there. Southern France is 
supposedly nice this time of 
year and doesn’t suffer from 
Pittsburgh’s schizophrenic 
weather. 
I gathered information from 
the study abroad folk early in 
my Carnegie Mellon career, 
and I’m still getting spam 
from some of the programs, 
but in all it’s an exciting 
process to go through. A 
number of our friends have 
had great times in other 
countries.
On the other hand, only 
six-and-a-half months ’til 
Carnival!
Matt & Ryan

“If I have to hear one more time that you did this for the 
family...”
Obviously, spoilers abound throughout this article.
Since its invention, television has always been a source 
of shared cultural moments in America. Together we 
witnessed the cast of Friends grab coffee at Central 
Perk one last time as well as Jerry, Elaine, George, and 
Kramer enter their shared prison cell for violating the 
Good Samaritan law (it was new) on the series ?nale of 
Seinfeld.
While many say that these kinds of unifying events have 
become a thing of the past due to the rise of special 
interest entertainment and news outlets, that isn’t 
entirely true. Case in point, last night we all watched 
the conclusion of high-school-chemistry-teacher-turned-
crystal-meth-kingpin Walter White’s incredible story 
with the series ?nale of AMC’s Breaking Bad.
“If we’re gonna go that way, you’re going to need a 
bigger knife.”
Breaking Bad began in 2008 with Walter White (Bryan 
Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher with a 
pregnant wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), and a son with 
cerebral palsy, Walt Jr. (RJ Mitte). Walt is handed a death 
sentence when he is diagnosed with inoperable lung 
cancer and turns to a former student of his named Jesse 
Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to help him use his knowledge of 
chemistry to cook and distribute crystal meth.
Walt and Jesse become known for producing incredibly 
pure meth, evidenced by its blue color. As Walter’s 
criminal enterprise grows, he adopts the pseudonym 
“Heisenberg” and begins accruing a body count that 
rivals his rising stacks of cash. Competition, potential 
informers and witnesses, and anyone else who could 
jeopardize Walt’s business are all disposed of over the 
course of the series. Five seasons later, Walt decides to 
retire, sitting on top of $80 million in cash.
Walt would’ve been able to die with peace of mind 
that his family was taken care of if not for one major 
wrench in the gear: speci?cally, his brother-in-law Hank 
(Dean Norris), a DEA agent tasked with tracking down 
Heisenberg. Over the course of his manhunt, Hank is 
shot at and loses the use of his legs for a period of time, 
in addition to going through just simple, plain, hellish 
mental anguish.
Around the same time as Walt’s decision to retire, some 
revealing bathroom reading causes Hank to realize that 
his nerdy brother-in-law who claims to have recently hit 
it big at the casino is actually the drug lord who has all 
but been ruining his life for the past few years. At the 
beginning of the second half of season ?ve, we ?nd Hank 
now determined to put Walt behind bars, Jesse reeling 
with guilt over his and Walt’s actions over the course of 
their enterprise, and a criminal underworld desperate 
for someone who can cook crystal meth as well as 
Heisenberg can.
So, the question that’s been on everyone’s mind — “How 
will it end?” — has ?nally been answered. The ?nale 
delivered everything fans of the series could’ve hoped 
for. The trademark bouncing between nail-biting tension 
and hilarious comedy? Check. Watching Walt settle all 
remaining scores? Check. Finding yourself rooting for 
a man who breaks into a home and coldly describes to 
the inhabitants how easily he could have them killed? 
Check. The ?rst hour of the episode feels like climbing 
the ?rst hill of a roller coaster — that tense feeling deep 
in your gut that you know is about to explode: You ?nd 
yourself both anticipating it and dreading it.
“How are you feeling? Kind of under the weather, like 
you have the ?u? That would be the ricin I gave you.”
The ?nal 15 minutes contain everything fans have been 
waiting to see for the past ?ve seasons. As the credits 
rolled, it was hard to pick a favorite moment: seeing 
Walt put a whole belt of .50-caliber bullets through 
Jack’s skinhead gang with the press of a button or Jesse 
strangling Todd to death with the chains that kept him 
cooking meth against his will. Perhaps, though, it was 
when Walt put the ?nal bullet into Jack’s skull, the man 
who had killed Hank and stolen all the money he had 
made. Or maybe, just maybe, it was seeing Jesse break 
through the fence of the compound, ?nally free.
“Nothing happens until you say that you want this.”
“I want this.”
The ?nale changed the tone of the series dramatically. 
When Walt reveals that the true reason he kept up the 
whole thing was that it was the only thing that made 
him feel truly alive, Breaking Bad goes from the story of 
a man doing whatever it took to provide for his family 
to the story of a man trying to live in the face of certain 
death. It’s ?tting then that Walt ?nally passes away in a 
meth lab; he dies in the only place he truly lived.
Breaking Bad has been called the best show in a new 
golden age of television. It’s a bold statement to make, 
but now that the show can be taken as a whole, the 
claim lies on solid ground. 
“Yeah, bitch.”

screen and relive your middle school moments: Cady 
Heron (Lindsay Lohan) struggles to ?nd her way as she 
befriends queen bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams) 
and her little workers — the Plastics. Full of hilarious 
moments and truths about the girl world, Mean Girls is 
the perfect movie to watch with friends when you just

Gandhi
Saturday, Oct. 5

If you ever wanted a good look into the lives of one 
of the greatest spiritual leaders of our time, Gandhi is 
a great place to start. Director Richard Attenborough 
brings Gandhi’s journey to life in the form of a true epic. 
Sir Ben Kingsley is a compelling force as the titular 
spiritual leader who manages to compel both empathy 
and awe with his performance. Gandhi is a magnetic ?lm 
that not only allows a peek into a great man’s journey 
and struggles, but is also one that is poetically imbued 
with truths about humanity.
The Place Beyond the Pines
Friday, Oct. 4
7 10
Imagine Ryan Gosling on a motorcycle, tatted up and 
teary eyed as he embarks upon a crime drama. If you 
like the sound of that, The Place Beyond the Pines might 
be for you. Be careful, though. This is a drama about 
fatherhood and consequences, and its focus is more 
heart wrench than heartthrob. Gosling plays the role of 
a motorcyclist who makes the heavy decision to commit 
a crime for his son but collides with a police of?cer, 
played by Bradley Cooper. Their struggle has long-term 
consequences for their families. The ?lm is thrilling yet 
organic enough for us to learn about morality and family.

International artists preach ENOUGH Violence
Society for Contemporary Crafts exhibit brings discussions on violence to the community
At the Society for Contemporary Crafts in the Strip 
District in Pittsburgh, an exhibition called ENOUGH 
Violence: Artists Speak Out opened last Friday. The 
exhibition seeks to explore how art can shed light on 
creative solutions to the urgent issue of increasing 
violence in the U.S. and around the world. The project is 
an interdisciplinary collaboration among artists, mental 
health professionals, academics, and community leaders 
that uses a multimedia platform to enable viewers to 
participate in a genuine discussion about violence and 
how it affects people.
The exhibition intertwines art with social work, social 
justice, and psychology to ask the complex question of 
what we can do as a community to combat violence. It 
features the work of 14 renowned artists and craftsmen 
from the U.S. and Europe working with photography, 
prints, painting, clay, fabric, and metal. The exhibition 
also includes two interactive components: a physical 
space in the main gallery for visitors to create their 
own “personal talisman to carry along with them” and 
a public Tumblr collection of people’s own stories about 
their experiences with violence.
Participating artists have chosen to focus their artwork 
on topics ranging from domestic abuse and rape to war 
and terrorism. Many of the pieces rely on disturbing 
imagery, including life-size sculptures of naked children 
praying on their knees, a menorah made of handguns, 
and an American ?ag with a symbolic red circle in the 
center. Despite the seriousness, the works also have an 
element of hope and resilience from people who have 
overcome violence.
Boris Bally (CFA ’84), a former adjunct professor in the 
School of Art and the School of Design, is a Pittsburgh 
native and metalsmith with three pieces in the 
exhibition. In the 1990s, Bally became involved in an 
anti-violence coalition that made him interested in 
anti-violence art. In 1997, Bally curated a show titled 
Artists of a Different Caliber in the former Hewlett 
Gallery at Carnegie Mellon, which challenged artists 
to create sculptures out of decommissioned handguns 
from buyback programs — programs that aimed to take 
guns out of civilian hands. “I had been interested in 
the handguns for a while; I had about 200 guns in my 
studio,” he said.
Bally’s work for the current exhibition is in the same 
vein as the show in 1997. He created three pieces out of 
handguns — “Loaded Menorah,” “Brave 4: Breastplate,” 
and “Bear Claw Necklace” — that draw inspiration from 
indigenous cultures and religious traditions while being 
juxtaposed with the violent reality of the present era.
The exhibition will be open through March 22. During 
that time, numerous events and guest lectures 
by professors, educators, community leaders, and 
artists will aim to ?nd creative solutions to violence. 
The Society for Contemporary Crafts will also host 
information sessions on regional social service agencies 
on the ?rst Saturday of each month while the exhibition 
is on display. For more information, call 412-261-7003.

A car covered in doll appendages, a 40-foot rubber duck 
on the Allegheny River, and multisensory exhibitions 
— Friday night was one of many strange and exciting 
?rsts as Pittsburghers and students alike gathered in 
Downtown’s Cultural District for the quarterly Gallery 
Crawl, hosted by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
This year, 28 businesses and galleries, plus one bridge, 
opened their doors to the people of Pittsburgh to 
encourage exploration of the rich and diverse culture the 
city has to offer.
The highlight of the evening was the Rubber Duck 
Bridge Party, hosted by Mikey and Big Bob from KISS 
FM’s Morning Freak Show on the Roberto Clemente 
Bridge. The party blocked off car traf?c on the bridge as 
Mikey and Big Bob blasted music and vendors of food, 
art, and memorabilia set up shop.
The event celebrated the unveiling of The Rubber Duck 
Project, a four-story-tall ?oating rubber duck designed by 
Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman. Hofman’s “Rubber Duck” 
has traveled the world, ?oating through Amsterdam, 
Belgium, Sydney, and Hong Kong — but Friday night 
marked its U.S. debut. “It’s a cool thing that it’s in 
Pittsburgh ?rst,” said sophomore statistics major Caitlin 
Selvaggi. “[Pittsburgh] is an up-and-coming city, and 
this is a symbol of that.”
Hofman’s website says that the duck was designed to 
be “soft, friendly, and suitable for all ages.” It’s clear that 
the artist met his goal from the sheer number of families, 
couples, and friends that came out to enjoy the view. The 
bridge was swarming with people, everyone clamoring 
for a look and a picture of the duck. The more daring 
observers climbed the bridge itself, standing on the 
barrier between road and walkway to get a clear shot.
The party was the launch of the Pittsburgh Festival of 
Firsts, which continues through Oct. 20. During the 
festival, the city will host the U.S. premieres of numerous 
theater, dance, music, and visual art displays. On Friday 
night, three other installations had their U.S. debut, 
including Kurt Hentschlager and Ulf Langheinrich’s 
Granular Synthesis: Model 5 and POL in the SPACE art 
gallery on Liberty Avenue.
Model 5 consists of a large screen curtained off, upon 
which four large images are projected. The images 
shift and move in time to a rhythmic bass, creating a 
multisensory experience. Viewers sit down and take in 
the experience, soaking in the physical vibrations from 
the bass rhythms as the pictures shift and change.
But as soon as viewers become comfortable with the 
rhythm, the mood, and the images themselves, these 
details suddenly shift to something new. Sophomore 
English major Sayre Olson said she was “never fully 
satis?ed” with the piece because it felt as if “the art was 
always one step ahead of you.”
Another installation that examines perception is Francis 
Crisa?o’s HOLDUP in the HOOD in the 707 Penn Gallery. 
The photographs incorporate drawings and recycled 
materials such as magazines in an exploration of self-
perception, race, gender, and identity, especially in pop 
culture. 
Crisa?o, who studied printmaking and painting at 
Carnegie Mellon, said in his artist’s statement that this 
installation was created out of a “larger body of work that 
documents an after-school, collaborative arts curriculum 
rooted in self-portraiture.”
“It was a very high concept, but not so weird that I didn’t 
get it,” sophomore chemistry and English double major 
Sophie Zucker said, “although it was hard to pinpoint 
one message.”
The most striking images show people holding magazine 
covers in front of their faces. The covers feature the face 
of a model and obscure all of the distinctive features of 
the subjects except their eyes, replacing them with an 
example of societal standards of beauty. This pattern 
creates an interesting juxtaposition between societal 
standards and natural beauty, causing the viewer to 
examine where beauty truly lies.
The quarterly Gallery Crawl makes a splash in Downtown’s Cultural District

This quarter’s crawl also featured a number of 
Pittsburgh-speci?c explorations, most notably the PNC 
Legacy Project at 600 Liberty Ave. This exhibit has been 
open for about a year and is a permanent display of the 
rich history of Pittsburgh through visual images and oral 
histories.
Visitors are able to compare and contrast images of the 
city in the past and present through interactive touch 
screen displays, featuring notable locations such as the 
North Shore. The exhibit also showcases an interactive 
wall projection of the city skyline in 1951. As you walk 
toward the wall, the projector senses your presence, and 
the image shifts to a 2013 skyline in the space where 
your shadow would normally be.
Just to the right of that piece, small boxes are suspended 
from the ceiling, each containing a miniature speaker. 
Each box features a short oral history of Pittsburgh by 
notable residents — such as founding owner of the 
Pittsburgh Steelers Art Rooney — accessible by pressing 
a button and holding the speaker up to your ear. The 
exhibit is an interesting look back on the city’s history in 
the midst of such modern art in the district.
Other features of the event included interactive activities 
that invited the attendees to become artists themselves. 
“The Art of Pierogie Making” at Braddock’s American 
Brasserie and free dance lessons and demos at the 
Arthur Murray Dance Studio are just two examples of the 
inclusive nature of the event, where the lines between 
art and viewer were blurred.
The mixture of function and form was also present in the 
kNOT Dance at Verve Wellness. Three pieces of brightly 
colored fabric were suspended from the ceiling, creating 
swings on which dancers performed.
The dancers showcased their skills as they climbed, 
swung, and hung from the fabric, bringing to mind 
acrobats in a circus. The graceful beauty of their 
movements contrasted with the industrial setting of 
what appeared to be a transformed storage loft, creating 
a juxtaposition that perfectly represents the city of 
Pittsburgh and its history.
Down the street was the most functional art of the 
night: Art Car Round Up, a showcase of four highly 
decorated cars at 8th Street and Penn Avenue. Greg 
Phelps’s “That Car #3” is a Nissan Versa covered in small 
round mirrors, stones, corks, and bumper stickers. Upon 
closer inspection, the car’s immediate aesthetic beauty 
becomes distorted by the various doll pieces placed on 
the car. Arms, legs, and a few heads can be seen amidst 
the shiny pieces that dominate the display.
According to Phelps, this is the only car he owns, and he 
drives it every day, calling himself “the lazy man’s good 
Samaritan”: All he has to do is drive around and people 
are pointing and smiling, creating conversations and 
connections. “That Car #3” is Phelps’s third art car, and 
his art car project has progressed over two years. As for 
what motivates his process, Phelps simply says that it’s 
fun.
The Gallery Crawl can be overwhelming with so many 
sights and sounds ?ghting for dominance, but even 
a cursory exploration reveals hidden art and culture. 
Zucker said that the experience gave her a chance to 
“explore Pittsburgh as a city in its own right and as a 
cultural center.”
“[I’ve] never been downtown when it was alive,” she 
said.
The event gives Pittsburgh the chance to come together 
to explore its art scene and get a glimpse of the city it is 
becoming. This fall’s Gallery Crawl explored perception 
and sense, compared history and the present, and 
mingled mature themes with childhood memories.
Most of the exhibits featured on Friday night are just 
beginning, so even if you missed the event, you can 
still experience the art. A complete list of exhibitions is 
available on the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust website, along 
with information about the Festival of Firsts.

5 is among the pieces featured in Ulf Langheinrich and Kurt Hentschlager’s Granular Synthesis and portrays artist 
Akemi Takeya in a series of manipulated images that aim to evoke a sense of schizophrenia and anxiety.
