At a meeting of the Senior Class 
held last Thursday the report of the 
committee appointed to systematize 
and place in permanent form all in­
formation pertaining to the year book, 
was approved and handed over to the 
Class of 1909. So much had been 
said during the latter part of last 
semester and the early part of this, 
on the matter of corrupt political 
methods extant in the school, it was 
considered prudent by the Class of 
1908 to put the Thistle in such form 
that it would not only be easy for 
future classes to follow, but, render it 
impossible for cliques to make the 
book their catapult for express use in 
slinging mud at those who are in 
ill favor with the narrow set.
BY-LAWS OF THE THISTLE.
“The Thistle” shall be the name of 
the year book published by the Junior 
Classes of the Schools of Applied 
Science and Applied Design (Day and 
Night) of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools. It shall be published once 
every year, and shall be representative 
of the two schools above named.
The Board of Editors shall consist of 
Two members of the Junior Class of 
the Night School of Applied Science. 
One member from the Junior Class of 
the Night School of Applied Design. 
Two members from the Junior Class of 
the Day School of Applied Science. 
Two members from the Junior Class of 
the Day School of Applied Design.
The two chief offices of the Board 
shall be held by members from the 
Day School of Applied Science.
The members constituting the Board 
shall be appointed at the beginning 
of each school year, by their respec­
tive class officers? in conjunction with 
the Faculty Committee on Student Or­
ganizations.
The Officers shall be elected from 
the Board by the Board.
The Business Manager and Editor-in- 
Chief of the previous Thistle shall act 
as an Advisory Board for the present 
Board, in case any information or ad­
vice is desired.
In case of any profit „ being realized, 
the successful Board shall take such a 
portion of said proceeds as is neces­
sary to provide its members with some 
distinctive souvenir, the amount not to 
exceed three ($3.00) dollars each, and 
the remainder shall be turned over to 
the Fund for Student Organizations.
The interest, as well as the assist­
ance, of the Plebe class from the Day 
Schools and the first and second year 
men from the Night Classes, shall be 
encouraged, with a view to their gain­
ing experience for their Junior year.
These men shall not be considered 
as members of the Board, but when 
the book is ready for press, two of 
the most worthy from both the Day 
and Night Classes shall be selected by 
the Board, and these men shall be rep­
resented in the book as being members 
of the Board.

THE TARTAN
Mauretania Machinery — Interesting 
Comparisons with the Lusitania.
Will the Mauretania create new At­
lantic records? Judging from the 
speeds .she attained on her prelimi­
nary trials, when the highest record­
ed was 20.7 knots, and this with the 
hull in a foul condition and with dam­
aged propeller blades, it seems highly 
probable that she will do so. It is 
not generally known that, although 
the space available for the machinery 
is practically the same as in her Clyde 
built sister, the Lusitania the Tyne­
side firm were given a free hand in 
arranging much of the auxiliary ma­
chinery and piping, with the result 
that in such work the Mauretania may 
have secured some distinct advant­
ages. A writer in the Mechanical 
World emphasizes the importance 
that might attach to the differences in 
machinery arrangement in the two 
vessels. Aft of the turbine rooms in 
the Mauretania is the main condenser 
room. In this department there is a 
great divergence from the Lusitania, 
for whereas in her case there were 
four main condensers, here there are 
only two—of course, very much larger. 
The cooling surface in each is about
42,000 square feet, and each contains 
nearly 1G,000 tubes. The inside 
diameter of the shell must be about 
18 feet 6 inches, and the length about
13 feet 6 inches. They constitute a re­
markable piece of work, and as the 
two are together capable of condens­
ing 1,000,000 pounds of steam per 
hour, they must be the largest sur­
face condensers ever constructed. 
Each condenser receives its circulat­
ing water through two pipes 32 inches 
in diameter. A novel feature is that 
these condensers are designed on a 
partial Contrafio principle. The tubes 
are divided into two nests by a water 
tray, and the greater part of the 
steam is condensed in the top nest. 
The remaining uncondensed steam 
passes over the tray and meets the 
cold tubes in the lower nest, instead 
of (as in the case of an ordinary con­
denser) tubes already coated with a 
film of hot water. By this means the 
cooling surface is most efficiently 
utilized. The steam which is con­
densed over the tray passes through a 
light non-return valve of the Kinghorn 
type to a high lift turbine pump driven 
by an electric motor, and situated 
very low down, so that the head will 
assist the flow. This pump discharges 
the hot water to the hot well tanks 
built into the condenser seating. The 
economy of this arrangement cannot 
be questioned, as, in addition to the 
advantages of the Contrafio principle, 
the drawing of the hot water from the 
tray must save a large amount of 
heat energy to the system, which heat 
energy would otherwise pass out with 
the circulating water.
Turning to the turbines themselves, 
some very radical differences can be 
noted. The main bearing* are very 
massive in the Mauretania machinery, 
the journals being 33 inches in 
diameter and about 6 feet 6 inches 
long in the case of the low pressure. 
A novel feature about them is that 
they are supported on spherical seats, 
and so can adjust themselves to any 
slight want of alignment. This is es­
pecially important, in view of the
great revolving weights, something 
like 130 tons in the case of the low- 
pressure rotor; and also in view of the 
uncertain expansion of the. turbine 
casings. The low-pressure turbines of 
the Mauretania have a few more rows 
of blades than those of the Lusitania, 
thus insuring a trifle higher efficiency, 
and possibly slightly more power. The 
Mauretania turbines are bladed entire­
ly on the very mechanical system in­
troduced by Messrs. Willans and Rob­
inson, except that (to avoid reducing 
the power) no shroud rings are fitted 
over the blade tips. In the Lusitania 
this system of blading is only adopted 
for the longest blades on the low pres­
sure turbines. The turbine rotors are 
also entirely different in the two ships.
The boilers in the Mauretania are 3 
inches less in diameter than those of 
the Lusitania, although the length is 
the same; but by utilizing the 
capacity of the boilers to a greater ex­
tent the Wallsend Company have suc­
ceeded in obtaining nearly G per cent 
more heating surface and about 5 per 
cent more grate area on a smaller 
weight of boiler. In the Lusitania, 
Admiralty type ventilators are fitted 
with the idea of keeping the boat deck 
free from obstruction, while in the 
Mauretania the usual cowls are adopt­
ed.
Another point worthy of notice is 
that the propellers of the Mauretania 
are G inches larger than the original 
diameter of the Lusitania’s screws.—

A. F. Stamm, Editor.
Acting in the best interest of read­
ers of the Tartan, the Class of 1911 
will forego their inning in the “mud- 
slinging” contest originated and main­
tained by 1910. In a duel of wits a 
better medium could be found which 
would give the same satisfaction mi­
nus the publicity. Exit the subject 
from the 1911 column.
In the inter-class debate on Decem­
ber 20th, Messrs. Considine and Ba­
ker of 1910, will oppose the Messrs. 
Workman and R. S. Gline of 1911. 
The subject chosen is a very deep 
one and offers a large field for both 
sides. It reads as follows:
“Resolved, That bachelors should 
be taxed to support old maids.”
The Wrestling match scheduled for 
the smoker is to be between two crack 
amateurs, McCulley, of ’11, and Bur­
ton, of the Preps. Mr. Burton is a 
first-class man on the mat and was 
entered in the recent A. A. U. tourna­
ment at Old City Hall. He repre­
sented the Pittsburg Central Y. M. 
C. A. McCulley says, “The bout will 
be a good one, for I’ll certainly do my 
best to prevent any one making a 
monkey of me before my own class.”
F. E. Foster is going to give a 
travelogue, which will, in point of 
humor and entertainment rival those 
of Burton Holmes. He will tell “How 
to do Europe on $80.”
Capt. Scotty Henderson will give us 
a talk on Athletics, and the leader of 
the Mandolin Club will play a solo 
or two. There are other numbers as 
good as those mentioned which will 
add greatly to the attractiveness of 
the program. A feature, and a prom­
inent one, will be Pollock’s-Pipes 
(wit^h the makins).
As the faculty intends cutting off 
the last period would it not be well to 
show appreciation by attending the 
smoker. Costs but “two bits” and a 
little loyalty.
THE TARTAN
The bad weather put the “pie 
squad” out of business.
1912 is showing a commendable 
amount of enthusiasm in their class 
affairs; 1910 and 1911 would do well 
to copy.
That the fast approaching holiday 
season may be the merriest ever, and 
that the ensuing year will be the hap­
piest and most prosperous in her his­
tory (up to date) is the wish 1911 ex­
tends to Tech, her faculty, her ath­
letes and her students (even 1910). 
---------o---------
I NINETEEN TEN |
L. C. Frank was chosen as repre-
1910 appreciates the invitation of
1911 to participate in their smoker 
on the 20th and will take pleasure in 
being present.
It was suggested that the Musical 
Clubs give an entertainment for the 
benefit of the Athletic Association. 
Let the Athletic Association make all 
arrangements, such as providing the 
hall, and programes and printing and 
disposing of the tickets and no doubt 
the Musical Clubs will do the rest.
The subjects of fraternities has 
been mentioned quite frequently 
among the members of the class re­
cently, and a meeting will soon be held 
to consider the subject more seriously 
and in detail. Here is a good chance 
for the day students to show their 
much talked of friendship for the night 
men and help them along with sug­
gestions.
The “banquet feeling” is beginning 
to show itself among the boys and all 
are in favor of holding the annual 
“feast” a little earlier than last year. 
Remembering the good time we had on 
the last occasion, it is to be hoped 
that as successful a committee will 
have charge as the one of last year. 
Get busy Smith.
The Mandolin Club will entertain 
the parents and friends of the scholars 
of the Summer Vacation Schools, with 
a concert, in the Hall of the Lawrence- 
ville Play Grounds, on Saturday even­
ing, December 21st.

Remember this After the Holidays.
A man went into a train yard one 
day to get an engine to draw a very 
heavy load over a steep hill. He first 
came to a large engine which had 
stood in the yard for some time.
“Will you draw my load over the 
hill?” he asked.
..... “I’m here for repairs,” the engine 
answered, “and cannot work yet.”
The man went on till he came to an­
other large engine, that had just come 
into the yard.
“Will you draw my load over the 
hill?” he asked.
“I’ve just come in from a long trip, 
and need oiling and cleaning, so can­
not work again just yet/' it answered.
The man turned away in despair, but 
saw a little engine puffing a short dis­
tance away.
“Can you draw my load over the 
hill?”, he asked.
“I have just come in to get oiled up,” 
it answered, “but I think I can.” So 
the man went away with the little en­
gine delighted.
The engine started up the hill with 
the load puffing energetically, saying 
to itself all the time, “I think I can, I 
think I can, I think I can.” The hill 
got steeper and steeper, and the en­
gine puffed slower, saying, “I think I 
can,’I think I-can.”
The load felt heavier as the little 
engine went up puffing more slowly, 
“I—think—I—can, I—think—I—can,” 
then, “I think I can, I think I can, I 
think I can,” for the load was now 
over the hill and going down the other 
si-de.
Let us all try to be plucky little en­
gines, no matter how many large en­
gines may be about us; setting bad 
examples.

The engagement of Miss Munson to 
Mr. William Fuller Smart, of Lewiston, 
Maine, now of Pittsburgh, has been
announced. Miss Munson has been 
receiving the best wishes of the fac­
ulty, and of the pupils, for her happi­
ness. We all hope Miss Munson will 
decide to stay with us for another 
year, at‘least, till the 1909 girls grad­
uate. She would be very much missed 
by us all especially the Household 
Arts girls, for sewing would not have 
the same charm without her.* * *
The Christmas play to be given this 
week by the Glee Club will be a stan­
dard for all glee clubs to come. The 
caste of the play is as follows:
Place—England.
Time—The Saxon Period.
Characters—My Lord and Lady 
Gotrox, their children, the nurse, and 
butler, a band of mummers, and a band 
of waites.
Scene—Christmas eve, at the home 
of My Lord and Lady. They call in 
the waites and mummers and offer 
them Christmas cheer, after summon­
ing their children to see the dances, 
and hear the songs of these pictur­
esque, fastastique, Christmas serenad- 
ers. Santa Claus bells are heard as 
the curtain goes down.
---------o---------
The following was observed in a 
Pittsburg street car recently:
The car was comfortably filled 
(mostly with men) and each passen­
ger was occupying a seat, or rather 
a portion of one, when two middle 
aged women boarded it. Immediately 
two of the male passengers arose and 
with a courteous raising of the hat 
offered up their seats. Not long afier 
they obtained seats through some of 
the passengers leaving the car. The 
young men (they were young and well 
dressed) were not to posses their 
comfort very long, however, as three 
women boarded the car at the next 
corner. They again got up and re­
peated their little performance of 
gallantry and noticing the smile (of 
approval) on the faces of their fellow 
passengers looked at each other, 
hesitated a moment, then,—straps 
were abandoned, strong right hands 
shot out, a hearty shake given to the 
simple remark simultaneously utter­
ed, “You’re a Tech man, aren’t you?” 
(An eye witness.)
[The school may certainly be proud 
to learn that the only gallant gentle­
men in this little episode were Tech 
men.—Ed.]

THE TARTAN1
Plebes.
Dowell W. Niools, Editor^
Did you ever stop to inquire into 
the cause of that mysterious something 
usually called school spirit or school 
loyalty, long enough to actually come 
to some definite conclusion as to what 
are the things that enter into it? No 
doubt but that you have noticed that 
a Yale man tells you there is no other 
college that can come up to Yale, 
and a Princeton man will go a long 
distance out of his way to convince 
you that the Tiger is not only the 
best emblem to be guided by, but posi­
tively the ONLY one. And now even 
though we have been connected with 
the schools for only three months, and 
some of us in a none too substantial 
manner just at present, is there a man 
in the class who in some way or other 
does not have a sense of pride in the 
fact that he is a student here, every 
time he hears the name of Tech men­
tioned? No it’s not sentimental, either. 
Cheap sentiment is always associated, 
in my mind at least, with dime novels 
or Tomantic love, sick old maids who 
make scrap books of newspaper poetry. 
School spirit is a hard thing to define. 
Hard as that may be, it is harder still 
to make anything out of a school in 
which it is lacking. No hardy, manly 
and unselfish spirit of love and rever­
ence for an institution of learning can 
come without a sacrifice of some sort 
from every one of the men who com­
pose the student body.
You haven’t any time, haven’t you? 
How hard have you tried to make 
some? You can’t spare the time from 
your lessons? Well, it’s a pity about 
you, all right. You say the class offi­
cers do everything that is to be done,
and in consequence there is nothing
left for you to do, or that is the way
you feel about it, at any rate. But
let me say right here, and in as em­
phatic a manner as possible, that the 
class officers can not accomplish any­
thing worth while without your sup­
port. When a class meeting is called, 
go to it, the Gardens will keep, they 
make a new supply of ice over there 
every day. If appointed to do some­
thing, do it the very best you know 
how; and if not appointed to do the 
same thing, you can serve the school 
just as well by not taking your spite 
on things and people in general.
Fischer—Well I think if a man’s 
father died and left him $100,000 he’d 
be a (pause) bum.
Dyer—The earth revolves around on 
an axle.
Prof. Hornbostel (when the applause 
following Decker’s successful attempt 
at lowering the blind had stopped) — 
It’s the little things that make a man 
famous, all right.
Bickley, the slide-rule artist—Well! 
*1 got 361-4 but did not know that 361 
was a perfect square.
Prof. Keller—What was the matter 
with the slide-rule, wasn’t it working?
Kennedy (discussing a sentence in 
English)—Well, you couldn’t say the 
jaws of the dragon ate it.
Mr. Lightner—Oh that depends upon 
taste.
Prof. Keller (after an Algebra exam) 
—That examination was a dead cinch, 
but you can’t learn Algebra by absorb- 
tion: that is by sitting in the same 
room with a text book for a couple 
of hours.

Our New Neighbor.
The purchase of a site assures the 
location of the Western University of 
Pennsylvania in the Oakland district. 
The Western University has suffered 
in the past from a location that forced 
the scattering of its departments and 
militated against solidarity. This con­
dition will be. at end once it is es­
tablished in its new location, with the 
hampering influences, which have re­
garded its growth in the past, removed 
*;Pittsburg will undoubtedly have with- 
-in its confines a university that will 
itake rank well up among the leaders.
Carnegie Tech welcomes W. U. P. 
because we see in her a rival, not in 
¿cuppiculeiifie -perhaps,,.but in athletics 
-and the various activities of school'V-'.life. We have been.more fortunate in 
bur brief career, except in the matter 
fof an athletic field, than they; but 
. we have missed the friendly rivalry of
i an older institution so necessary to a 
^younger in the development of school 
^spirit.
- Thus ilie new location will supply 
4*a want felt by each school and we see 
jtno reason why the two institutions, 
while-still friendly rivals, should not
• present a combined front that would 
be hard to rival. •
IN MEMORI AM.
A committee, composed of William 
Glasser and C. B. Cline, was appointed 
to investigate the condition surround­
ing the death of our former class­
mate and friend, James M. Kelly, of 
Nashua, N. H.
Mr. Kelly was overtaken by an at­
tack of typhoid recently, which 
proved fatal, he having died at a local 
hospital on Wednesday. The report 
of Mr. Kelly’s death was received at 
the school and steps were taken im­
mediately to render any assistance 
possible, as the circumstances, on in­
vestigation, were in a rather chaotic 
condition. The Committee, acting in 
conjunction with others interested, 
were able to render very material as­
sistance, and in token of the sympathy 
felt for Mr. Kelly’s summons and the 
deep regret expressed, drew up the 
following resolutions, which will be 
sent to Mr. Kelly’s parents:
Carnegie Technical Schools, 
Pittsburg, Pa., Dec. 11, 1907.
Whereas, It has pleased Providence 
to take from among us our esteemed 
friend and fellow student, James M. 
Kelly, let it be
Resolved, That we, acting in behalf 
of the Class of 1911, extend to Mr. 
Kelly’s survivors this expression of 
our deepest and sincerest sympathy 
in the hour of their grief, and that 
a copy of these resolutions be sent to 
them, together with a copy of the 
Tartan, in which the same appears.

Dr. E. W. Parker Addresses Day 
Students.
Dr. E. W. Parker of the United 
States Geological Survey and one of 
the most famous coal mining engineers 
of this country addressed the student 
body on December 11th, on “The Ne­
cessity of Safety Regulations in 
Mines.” It was Dr. Parker that Presi­
dent Roosevelt appointed on the com­
mittee of arbitration during the 1903 
anthracite coal troubles, as the tech­
nical member of that committee.
In his address to the students Dr. 
Parker emphasized the fact that, as he 
expressed it, the safest mines were 
the most unsafe. In other words, the 
mines that contained a large amount 
of gas were safe, owing to the rigid 
application of rules which prohibited 
any act at all liable to endanger either 
life or property. On the other hand he 
said little attention is paid to rules, in 
a mine that is considered safe. Dr. 
Parker furthermore dwelled upon the 
magnificent opportunities greeting the 
mining engineer who specialized in 
coal mining and told of the reluctance 
of most young men to go into this 
field.

Mr. Leete Is Moved Up.
The Tartan always takes pleasure 
in chronicling the advancement of the 
students friends. This week it is our 
Registrar Mr. Leete whose good for­
tune we are pleased to note. We are 
in receipt of information that Mr. 
Leete is now assistant to the director 
and advisory head of the school of 
Applied Science. The new position 
brings with it responsibilities that are 
different from those of registrar; but 
no one who knows Mr. Leete doubts 
for a minute that he will discharge 
them with the same apparent ease that 
has always characterized his work in 
the past.----—o------
The National Association of State 
Universities, at a meeting last Tues­
day in Washington, adopted a recom­
mendation made by joint committee of 
the Association and of the National 
Education Association, that a national 
university be established by an act of 
Congress in this part of Columbia, to 
be supported by the government, and 
to serve as a postgraduate school of 
colleges maintained by the state. This 
means that a bill embodying the 
recommendation will be brought be­
fore the next session of Congress.

will have an opportunity for practical 
forestry.

At the class meeting Friday evening 
the following officers were elected to 
take office January 3, 1908 :
President, Carl Helm; Vice Presi­
dent, Mr. Keagy; Secretary, Mr. 
Sample;: Treasurer, Mr. McCreery; 
Historian, Mr. Frame; Tartan Corres­
pondent, J. L. Hoffman; Advisor, Mr. 
Ande ; Marshal, Skeehan. Messrs. 
McCowen, Cole and R. Griffith were 
elected chairmen of the Athletic, Audit­
ing and Social committees respective­
ly.
The election was very spirited, the 
officers all having close seconds. By 
a motion of Mr. Sample the vote for 
President Helm was made unanimous.
. The class of 1912 held a meeting in 
the assembly room last week at which 
a constitution and by-laws were read 
and approved as submitted by the 
committee, with the exception of a few 
amendments.
A delegation from the 1911 class 
visited us during the past week, ex­
tending a cordial invitation to their 
smoker which will be held on Decem­
ber 20th. Owing to the fact that 1911 
lost the football match, they have final­
ly succeeded in finding a branch of 
sport, at which they believe 1912 can 
be outdone; namely, wrestling. A 
challenge was issued for any strong
1912 man to wrestle McCulley of 1911. 
The invitation and challenge were ac­
cepted, and 1912 earnestly requests all 
her members to be present.
Last Friday Mr. Weidlein very gen­
erously worked a little overtime in or­

Much obliged Mr. Weidlein!
Mr. C. N. Kingsley (C-l) has just ac­

Mr. Aude—Stung.
Prof. Hokanson—Do you think you 
can complete this problem in four 
minutes and thirty seconds?
Last Friday the class held a special 
meeting in the Chemistry lecture room 
for the purpose of nominating officers, 
a lively time was in order as each 
member had some remarks to make. 
It’s easily seen that there is great en­
thusiasm shown, because there are 
from four to seven candidates for each 
office. Keep the good spirit going.

At a mass meeting held recently at 
the University of California, the time 
was spent in a discussion as to the 
relative merits of Rugby and American 
football. The general sentiment ex­
pressed by the students was that 
American football should replace 
Rugby.
Kicking contests will be held this 
winter at Purdue to develop football 
material. A gold medal, worth not 
less than $10, will be given for the 
longest punt, and also for the most 
goals out of a certain number of at­
tempts.
Hereafter any man elected captain 
of the Chicago University ’Varsity 
eleven will be compelled to sign an 
agreement that he will graduate from 
college, before being given his cap­
tain’s “C.” The agreement is entirely 
one of honor. It was but recently in­
troduced, Captain Steffen being the 
first leader to go through the ordeal.

THE TARTAN11
Labor Managing Machinery.
When machinery is referred to as 
“labor saving” it is generally assumed 
that the principal object for which 
it is designed is to accomplish the 
work at less cost than would be the 
case if it were done entirely by hand.
Broadly speaking, this is the main 
object which the designer generally 
has in mind, but the use of labor sav­
ing machinery has shown that it is 
sometimes a valuable element in the 
management and regulation of labor, 
often to an extent which is little 
realized by either employers or em­
ployees.
When everything has to be handled 
by manual labor, there is little oppor­
tunity for an accumulation of mate­
rial on storage, and the manufacturer 
under such conditions is compelled 
almost to live “from hand to mouth,” 
so to speak. If labor troubles arise, 
from whatever cause, the work is 
paralyzed, since, in most cases, it is 
practically impossible to put a new 
and competent force at work. Mod­
ern machinery, however, does not 
strike, it is not subject to the con­
trol of outsiders, and since it can gen­
erally be operated by a few skilled 
men, there is far less trouble in keep­
ing it at work during labor difficul­
ties than with cruder appliances.
A notable example of the manner 
in which machinery of the right kind 
may strengthen the hands of a works 
manager is seen in the use of modern 
coal handling appliances. A works 
with ample coal-storage capacity, in­
cluding coal pockets, towers, hoists, 
shovels, and all the power resources 
involved, is in a position to proceed 
with its work under far less uncer­
tainty than if it was dependent upon 
large gangs of men, liable at any 
time to abandon their work and 
having no reserve stock upon which 
to draw to tide over the emergency. 
The mere presence of effective ma­
chinery and an ample storage capac­
ity may act to prevent labor trou­
bles, just as any reserve of strength 
may decide a conflict almost before 
it is begun.
Apart from, any such ^considera­
tions, however, the possession of a 
modern handling-plant is almost a 
necessity in any department of work 
in which interruption must not occur.
Such situations are increasing in 
number in all parts of the country 
almost daily. No power plant can 
afford to run today under any con­
dition, short of an earthquake, which 
may permit a stoppage as a possibil­
ity. Its fuel supply must be inde­
pendent of delays by rail or by water, 
as well of interruption by labor trou­
bles.
The trains must run, the trolleys 
be kept in motion, the electric lights \/ ^ ft OMf
must shine, and the motors receive
their current, and all these mean that

There is but one method to insure receive careful attention at the1

A discussion on sorority rushing re­
cently printed in the college monthly 
of Stanford, has caused considerable 
agitation on the campus. “As conduct­
ed at present,” says the writer, “the 
rushing season is not only an abused 
performance, but its immediate effect 
is to bring the whole college into ridi­
cule in the eyes of the outside world.”
We have learned from a reliable 
source that an enclosed athletic field 
for next year is assured. So many 
alarmist reports regarding this matter 
have emanated from the various 
sources within the past few months 
that the average student will be 
reticent; but we can give out this 
report as being reliable.

First Hockey Practice.
Last Thursday at noon the first 
hockey practice of the season was 
held at the Duquesne Gardens. The 
number of candidates allowed was re­
stricted to seven but a fair practice 
was had with the Lyceum team. Ly­
ceum took Tech’s back line while 
Tech took Lyceum’s back line so that 
matters were evened up a little better 
than would have been possible had 
the teams opposed each other in full 
strength. Baker did fair at goal, but 
will have to brace up as there are a 
number of good ones out for the posi 
tion. McCandless at point sustained 
a slight injury to his knee and so 
was not doing as well as he may be 
able to later in the season. Dowling 
played well at cover but was some­
what hampered by his lame hand. 
Mason played forward, Close right 
and Bright 'left wing, and Capt. 
Charles was in at center.
It is hoped that by the time this 
article is printed a regular practice 
at 10:30 p. m. can be arranged for 
the benefit of the night men, so all 
are urged to watch for notices con­
cerning hockey. It is very probable 
that Renssalaer Tech will be here to 
play on January 3rd and 4th, though 
nothing definite has been heard as 
yet. All Tech men are urged to at­
tend the game or games and to ask 
friends to do the same. Good cheer­
ing will brace up the Tech men won-1 
derfully, and a fast game of hockey 
will result. It is hoped that a great 
deal of the rowdyism of last year can 
be cut out either by warning or by 
eliminating the offending players.

The Differential Chain Block.
< >More than fifty years ago there was 
invented that most ingenious device, 
the Weston Differential Block, one of 
the simplest and at the same time 
most complete inventions ever pro­
duced by the ingenuity of man. To 
take the ancient Chinese windlass, 
that crude and impracticable embodi­
ment of the differential principle, and 
at one stroke convert it into an effect­
ive device, so well adapted to modern 
needs that no change has even been 
suggested in it since its first produc­
tion, constituted an act of invention 
well worthy of record in the history 
of engineering.
Two sheaves, with their hooks, and 
an endless piece of chain, practically 
but three working parts, constitute a 
chain hoist which enables one man to 
hoist as much as 500 pounds, to stop 
without any danger of the load run­
ning down, and to lower as gradually 
as may be necessary simply by pulling 
on one side or the other of the same 
chain as that which supports the load.
It is true that since the production 
of the simple, and practically universal 
differential chain block there have 
been perfected other chain blocks hav­
ing a higher mechanical efficiency, but 
in selecting a block for any specific 
use there are several kinds of effi­
ciency to be noted.
When a hoist is in continual service 
its mechanical efficiency, that is, the 
proportion of effort returned to the 
effort put in, becomes an important 
element in its value. When, however, 
a chain block is used for only a short 
time each day, the gain due to its use 
lies, not so much in its intrinsic effi­
ciency as in the fact that it is there, 
and that its presence avoids the neces­
sity for the diversion of highly-paid 
mechanics from wasting Iheir time in 
lifting and handling material, or in 
doing other work which properly is 
worth only the cost of the service of. 
a laborer. ...
In nearly every machine shop there 
is a certain amount of time required 
in handling material, placing it in the 
lathe or on the planer, or other tool, 
and this time may be shortened very 
appreciably by providing over the ma­
chine tool a simple running bar equip­
ped with a differential chain block. 
In many cases the running bar and
trolley may be omitted, and one or 
more eye-bolts used, since the chain 
block can be operated at a consider­
able angle without material invonven- 
ience. With such an equipment the 
machinist himself can handle nearly 
every job which comes to his machine 
without the aid of a laborer, or without 
the opportunity, otherwise found to be 
necessary, of calling upon his associ­
ates or neighbors for a lift.
For such service the mechanical effi­
ciency of the hoist is a matter of sec­
ondary importance, since it is in ac­
tion but a few minutes each day, and 
the question of convenience, as well 
as that of first cost, should be consid­
ered as of primary importance. Even 
the first cost, moderate as that may 
be, is trifling compared with the ac­
tual money saving which is effected 
by the presence of an apparatus which 
•renders the mechanic independent of 
any one else in the handling of his 
work. In some shops there are chain 
hoists kept in the tool room to be 
brought out and used when required, 
the result being that they are not 
brought out at all unless it is practi­
cally impossible to get along without 
them. Such a way to use a hoist is 
altogether too extravagant to be con­
sidered in a modern shop. The differ­
ential hoist, by reason of its low first 
cost, may properly be installed as a 
part of the tool which it is to serve, 
always there, and available at a mo­
ment’s notice, or rather without notice. 
Under such, circumstances its effi­
ciency can be considered, not so much 
from a mechanical point of view as 
from the consideration of its effective­
ness in saving time, a saving which 
means that increase in output upon 
which the effectiveness of a whole 
plant depends.—Cassier’s Magazine.

While this study is in progress a 
third line of investigation is being fol­

experiments can be conducted which 
will show that kerosene oil can be used 
for supplying power for gasoline or

provements and economies will have 
been made possible.

An interesting test now being made 
by the United States Geological Sur­
vey, technologic branch, in the Pitts­
burg station, is in relation to the uses 
of wood or denatured alcohol and gaso­
line for fuel purposes. These tests 
coming under the fuel-testing division 
of the organization came to Pittsburg 
where the station is now operating. 
Their significance is said to be of un­
usual importance to automobile build­
ers and those using gasoline for fuel, 
because gasoline is becoming scarcer 
every year and naturally higher in 
cost.
On the other hand, the possibilities 
of denatured alcohol are still barely 
known. In many instances its pos­
sibilities are still unexplored, and the 
investigation into this problem with 
the necessary investigation regarding 
the cost of production and possible 
quantity and quality obtainable from 
various sources of the country is being 
taken up along with the rest of the 
work.
A report on this matter given out 
recently shows that some of the ma­
chinery is still absent from the Pitts­
burg equipment to complete some of 
these tests. There are still at Nor­
folk, Va., some gas engines of different 
types and sizes which are needed. It 
is said that experiments are being 
made covering the entire range of this 
field, but for the present the chief 
center of study is confined to the ex­
amination of the different carburetters, 
with the object of showing the lines 
along which a more efficient method of 
evaporation of these fuels may be ob­
tained. Upon this depends the general 
efficiency of either alcohol or gasoline.
^The suggestion was recently made 
by a hockey enthusiast that the work 
started by some fellows last year on 
the pond in the hollow below the M. 
M. C. S., be taken up and finished by 
such fellows who are interested in 
that greatest of winter sports.
Upon the success of this undertak­
ing depends the solving of the hockey 
problem and with all this discussion 
of interclass games, things would 
begin to look bright.
Think it over fellows.

16THE TARTAN
Civil Engineering Society.
The Civil Engineering Society held 
its regular meeting Saturday night at 
the school building and was enter­
tained by a most interesting talk from 
Mr. E. K. Morse on the Subway prop­
osition in the city of Pittsburg. While 
the weather conditions were not favor­
able to a large gathering, the Society 
was well represented and it was a very 
attentive and enthusiastic audience 
that greeted the speaker when he was 
introduced after a few preliminary re­
marks by President Westbrook.
i Mr. Morse is a graduate Civil En­
gineer of Yale in 1881 and has been 
prominent as a structural engineer in 
Pittsburg for about 25 years. He is 
now engineer for a syndicate in 
charge of preparing plans for a sub­
way under the city.
He is a very pleasing speaker and 
had the closest attention of his listen­
ers throughout the entire evening. 
When he concluded his address, he i 
was kept busy answering questions 
until the meeting adjourned.
He began by telling of several 
shocks he had received during his life 
time, one of which he received in his 
Junior year at college.
“While engaged,” he said “in work­
ing out a railroad problem in the class 
roo*m,, the professor discovered the 
class trying to work out the formula, 
and at once threatened to condition 
the entire class. Upon being asked 
why, he said that he had been trying 
for years to teach them how to make 
a demonstration of the problems and 
apply the formula already worked out, 
and that if he discovered them trying 
to derive a formula again, he would 
condition the entire class. Needless 
to say there was no danger of our 
being conditioned after that. Now I 
am going to try and demonstrate this 
problem of rapid transit to you and 
will leave it with you to apply the 
formula.
./‘As we all know the bulk of the busi­
ness carried on in the city of Pitts­
burg is between the Point and the 
Hump. It may waver back and forth 
but never leaves this district which 
covers in all not more than about 210 
acres or a good - sized farm. It is in 
this section that relief must be fur­
bished.
The Pittsburg Railways Co. operate 
cars in all of what is now Greater
Pittsburg. It is impossible for them 
to reach all points in the city with 
surface cars. They could put on as 
many more cars on the suburban 
lines as they now have but it would 
increase the danger, and the conges­
tion of traffic in the down town district 
would be worse than any city in the 
world. We have further to contend 
with a very heavy wagon traffic which 
stays below the hump. Therefore it 
would be an injustice to the public to i 
increase the cars in order to meet the 
demands of the increasing travel. So, 
we can safely say that the solution vof 
this problem is not within the power 
of the Pittsburg Railways Co. There 
must be one of two things to furnish 
rapid transit and relieve this situation; 
either a subway or an elevated line.”
He then took up the proposition of 
an elevated road, and said that while 
the elevated had given relief where 
the surface cars failed to cope with 
the situation, but as the travel in­
creased, even they were declared in­
adequate and their removal is now 
under consideration.
Among some of the disadvantage of 
the elevated road mentioned were: 
Damage to property, whereas the first 
floor of buildings would be rendered 
almost useless. Very dark and noisy 
streets on account of the narrowness 
of streets, through the city. Supports 
and posts on the Streets, and exposure 
to all weather conditions. “Two of 
the most difficult matters to contend 
with,” he said, “are the narrow streets, 
and the tremendous price of property. 
The streets are only 40 feet wide or 
about one-half that which elevated 
cars have to contend with in other 
cities; and the cost of property would 
figure into millions almost beyond con­
ception.
“Again, I will say, that with the 
travel increasing 20% per year, this is 
not a satisfactory solution.”
He then took up the subway proposi­
tion and cited the following advantages 
it would give over the elevated:
“It could be made a rapid transit. 
It would not be noisy. It would not 
shut out the light or air. It would take 
up no room in the streets. It would 
not damage property. It would be 
easy to reach, and weather conditions 
would not interfere. Itwould never 
have to be rebuilt, or given up for 
something better. It could follow 
more direct lines, deliver passengers in

the heart of the business district and 
could be located where most needed.
“These reasons are very apparent. 
There is no solution, other than the 
subway, for this problem.
Then followed a very interesting ex­
planation of the methods by which this 
work would be accomplished and sev­
eral tracings were exhibited showing 
the proposed location of the subway.
At the close of his address a lunch 
was served by the members after 
which the meeting- was adjourned.———o-------
