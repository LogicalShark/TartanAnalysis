K&L Gates Conference sheds light on ethical issues in AI  
Staying vigilant in face of genocide
ADAM TUNNARD
Staffwriter
On April 9 and 10, 
the inaugural K&L Gates 
Conference on Ethics and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
sought to bring to light 
some of the prevailing 
issues that surround artifi-
cial intelligence, including 
“effects on the workforce, 
social justice, fairness, pri-
vacy and many other sec-
tors of society,” as the con-
ference website states.
In 2016, a $10 
million donation from 
Pittsburgh-headquartered 
international law firm 
K&L Gates funded the es-
tablishment of the K&L 
Gates Endowment for 
Ethics and Computational 
Technologies at Carnegie 
Mellon University.
The conference utilized 
this endowment to bring 
together some of the most 
important thought leaders, 
academics, industry heads, 
and others to discuss the 
boundless implications 
that come out of techno-
logical advances.
David   Danks, philosophy 
department head and 
co-chair of the Steering 
Committee for the K&L 
Gates Endowment for 
Ethics & Computational 
Technologies explained 
in a university press re-
lease that “computational 
technologies, particularly 
AI and robotics, are often 
developed and deployed 
without enough public 
engagement or discussion 
about their impacts.” 
Because of this, the confer-
ence attempts to discuss 
issues that have a public 
stake, with the collective 
good in mind.
His efforts, along with 
those of Professor Illah 
Nourbakhsh of the Robot-
ics Institute at Carnegie 
Mellon University, co-chair 
of the Steering Committee, 
and others on the commit-
tee, had the job to “iden-
tify key topics, develop a 
list of speakers, assemble 
the panels, and generally 
produce the content side 
of the conference,” Danks 
told The Tartan.
On this content 
side of the 
conference, speak-
ers included 12 
university-affiliated 
academics, members 
of the press Natasha 
Singer, a Technology Re-
porter at The New York 
Times and Tom Simonite, 
a Senior Writer for WIRED, 
as well as other influential 
players like Kerstin Vig-
nard, the Deputy Director 
at the U.N. Institute for 
Disarmament Research, 
and Rasu Shrestha, the 
Chief Innovation Officer 
and Executive Vice Presi-
dent of UPMC, among 
many others.
The keynote speaker 
Eric Horvitz, the Technical 
Fellow & Director at 
Microsoft Research Labs, 
spoke of the potential 
dangers of AI to serve as a 
form of “tyranny” if given 
to a government or corpo-
ration that doesn’t have the 
best interest of its popu-
lace, and on the issue of an 
“adversarial attack on at-
tention” given by AI appli-
cations online and in social 
media.
He also presented 
potential guidelines: that 
moving forward, we need 
to “collaborate widely” to 
create and utilize tech-
nology, and continue 
to “address costs, influ-
ences...and ethical and 
human rights challenges” 
of AI technologies to bet-
ter understand intelligence 
and to ensure that technol-
ogy isn’t used as a form of 
active oppression.
The last section of the 
panel discussion looked 
at the issue of "Agency 
and Empowerment" 
and how such con-
cepts will be affect-
ed in an AI-rich 
world. Questions 
of how to use 
AI technolo-
gies effectively 
were raised, as 
Chad Jenkins, 
associate pro-
fessor of com-
puter science 
and engineering at the 
University of Michigan, 
noted that it is a “vicious or 
virtuous cycle,” depending 
on who you ask, that turns 
students of AI into people 
who work for capital gains.
Other panelists 
discussed how to use AI 
for things that benefit so-
ciety, how to make sure 
disenfranchisement isn’t 
furthered by technologi-
cal growth, and other big 
questions: as Wendell 
Wallach, Senior Advisor at 
Yale University’s Hastings 
Center, put it, “what kind 
of world are we trying to 
create here.”
Other events of the 
conference included panels 
on the topics of "Equity of 
Access & Equity of Impact," 
"Trust," and "Policy and 
Governance," as well as 
a Professorship Spotlight 
Talk and sections to allow 
the inaugural K&L Gates 
Presidential Fellows, four 
Carnegie Mellon University 
doctoral students, to 
present their research.
The conference 
concluded with a speech by 
Jeffrey Sachs, economist, 
director of the Earth Insti-
tute at Columbia University, 
and special advisor to the 
U.N., who spoke not on 
the technological aspects 
of AI technology, but

Carnegie Mellon’s student newspaper since 1906
Bochco left deep impact on television
ALEX OH
Junior Staffwriter
The harsh realities 
associated with police 
work such as murder, 
rape, and corruption were 
all realistically captured 
in Steven Bochco’s vari-
ous television dramas. 
Bochco’s repertoire of tele-
vision programs includes 
NYPD Blue, L.A. Law, and 
most notably, Hill Street 
Blues which paved the way 
for a new and unexplored 
genre of television in the 
later twentieth century. 
He also fueled the success-
ful career of now cultur-
ally iconic star Neil Patrick 
Harris who appeared in 
Bochco’s medical comedy-
drama television series 
Doogie Howser, M.D.
After a hard-fought 
battle with leukemia, 
Bochco, the 1966 gradu-
ate of Carnegie Mellon 
University’s School of 
Drama, recently passed 
away on Sunday, April 1, 
at the age of 74. He was 
aided in his fight against 
a rare form of leukemia 
called blastic plasmacytoid 
dendritic cell neoplasm by 
a man named Jon Kayne 
who donated his stem cells 
in a transplant that extend-
ed the legendary screen-
writer and producer's life 
for a few years.
The realistic account 
of the life police officers 
leads in Bochco’s revo-
lutionary program Hill 
Street Blues starkly di-
verged from the con-
ventional formula of 
television entertainment 
at the time. He attributed 
his inspiration for the set-
ting of Hill Street Blues to 
his impression of the pov-
erty-ridden slums of Pitts-
burgh’s Hill District fur-
ther entrenching his work 
in something reflective of 
real life.
He created NYPD 
Blue with the intent of 
challenging the notion that 
network one-hour dramas 
did not belong on the more 
adult-fare broadcasting 
typical of cable networks. 
He pushed for the inclu-
sion of quality prime-time 
drama in cable television, 
commenting “the atmo-
sphere is far friendlier and 
the creative environment 
more conducive to doing 
original work”.
“His writing focused 
on dramatic realism, 
something that the 
industry hadn’t seen on the 
small screen at the time 
Hill Street Blues premiered 
in 1981,” says Dean of 
Carnegie Mellon’s College 
of Fine Arts Dan J. Martin, 
in a university press re-
lease. “He truly led the 
way for a new genre of 
innovative television.”
One of the first 
screenwriters to use an 
ensemble cast and hand-
held cameras in Hill Street 
Blues, Bochco altered 
the structure and form 
of television drama. He 
further innovated televi-
sion through his writing 
in which he implemented 
multi-episode storylines 
and a mixture of drama 
and comedy to bring levity 
to serious topics. His 
inventive thinking would 
influence the next genera-
tion of television dramas 
and numerous accolades 
including 10 Primetime 
Emmy Awards.
Throughout his career, 
Bochco consistently con-
tributed to the liveli-
hood and development 
of Carnegie Mellon 
University and its stu-
dents. His numerous 
donations and work with 
students helped Carnegie 
Mellon’s drama depart-
ment become what it is 
today. In 1986, Carnegie 
Mellon University 
awarded him an Alum-
ni Achievement/Merit 
Award for his five decades 
of groundbreaking work.
Bochco touched the 
lives of many individuals 
including Hill Street Blues 
cast member and close 
personal friend Charlie 
Haid. Also an alum-
nus of Carnegie Mellon 
University, Haid served as 
the associate producer of 
the original stage produc-
tion of Godspell in 1971 at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“Steven had a 
profound influence on 
my life, both personal 
and professional,” Haid 
recounts in a press release. 
“We created magic and 
madness together, laughed 
and cried, fought and 
forgave, for more than 
50 years. I’m but one of 
an amazing family that 
grew up together with 
Steven and mourn the 
loss of our pal.”
Steven Bochco’s 
legacy as an envelope-
pushing producer will 
live on as television and 
screenwriting inevitably 
mutate into something 
newer and exciting. His 
ideas and forward-think-
ing mindset have impacted 
creatives and will do so for 
generations to come.Top: Courtesy of Alan Light via Flickr Wikimedia Commons, Bottom: Lisa Qian/Photo Editor

This past week, people 
across the world held 
events for Holocaust re-
membrance week. On 
campus, the Hillel Jewish 
University Center of 
Pittsburgh organized a se-
ries of events and installed 
an adaption of the famous 
poem, “First they Came,” 
on The Cut, where they 
held a vigil on Thursday. 
One of these events was 
a Genocide awareness 
panel featuring profes-
sors Jay Aronson, Michal 
Friedman, and Ricky Law.
A genocide is ideologies 
of sovereignty implement-
ed to the most violent ex-
tremes. It is the worst in 
humanity. It is a lack of 
respect for humanity. Most 
members of society can as-
sert that it is important to 
study past genocides in or-
der to prevent them from 
happening again, and it 
was with this attitude that 
these three professors 
held this panel.
No genocide has been 
studied more commonly 
in American society than 
the Holocaust, but there 
have been plenty of lesser-
known catastrophic geno-
cides in the past century; 
the Armenian genocide, 
the Rwandan genocide, 
Bosnia’s racial cleansing, 
and Cambodia’s killing 
?elds. American slavery, 
though sometimes not 
categorized as a genocide, 
systematically dehuman-
ized people on the basis of 
their race, resulting in the 
death of an estimated two 
to ?ve million people.
All genocides stem 
from a sovereign group’s 
attempt to dehumanize 
a target group and show 
that they are lesser, but 
Professor Aronson poses 
that de?ning genocide 
may not be the most pro-
ductive effort. “I don't 
know how productive gen-
eralizing genocides is for 
the future. I don't know 
how useful coming up 
with a caricature of geno-
cide is helpful to prevent-
ing them.” He argues there 
are factors in every con-
?ict that don't carry over.
When studying the 
past, Professor Friedman 
asserts that it is important 
to learn about the victim’s 
culture beyond their de-
struction. One example he 
gave was that the Rwan-
dan genocide was the 
result of a post-colonial 
con?ict, not a major war 
breaking out.
Professor Friedman 
asked students to focus on 
the lives of victims beyond 
the genocide to remem-
ber the victims and what 
their cultures valued, 
reminding, “Their indi-
vidual lives were power-
ful.” Aronson added that 
the victims lived through 
our memories of them 
and that the day we for-
get is the second time the 
victims die. He says that 
his son often quotes a line 
by Macklemore in an as-
sertion of this idea, “heard 
you die twice, once when 
they bury you in the grave. 
And the second time is the 
last time that somebody 
mentions your name.”
It was apparent that 
each professor did not 
simply consider genocide 
a historical concept. There 
are always cultures and 
people in con?ict with 
one another, and national 
powers are constantly at-
tempting to rewrite and 
manipulate history.

36 percent of college 
students across the United 
States were food insecure 
in the last 30 days, accord-
ing to “Still Hungry and 
Homeless in College”, a re-
port published this month 
by Sara Goldrick-Rab and 
the Wisconsin Harvesting 
Opportunities for 
Postsecondary Education 
(HOPE) Lab.
Food insecurity 
describes the inability to 
acquire or lack of access to 
safe, nutritious foods. Not 
only is it linked to, in the 
most extreme cases, physi-
ological hunger, but also is 
associated academic per-
formance, poorer health, 
depression, and higher 
stress. Often, food insecu-
rity stems from the inability 
to afford safe, healthy foods, 
or the lack of geographic ac-
cess to those foods, or both. 
Lower rates of eligibility 
for public assistance for 
college students and stigma 
attached to socioeconomic 
status also present ad-
ditional barriers to food 
security.
As a response to this 
growing issue and to ?nd 
ways to better support stu-
dents on campus who may 
be struggling with basic 
needs issues such as food 
insecurity, the Graduate 
Student Assembly has creat-
ed the Basic Needs Working 
Group. Since its initiation, 
the working group has been 
focusing its efforts on re-
searching the feasibility and 
implementation of an on-
campus food pantry to ad-
dress the geographical and 
?nancial barriers to food 
security for the Carnegie 
Mellon community.
Basic Needs has also 
been meeting with the 
Campus Food Insecurity 
Committee, composed of 
relevant and interested 
members of administration 
from across the university, 
to discuss implementation 
and other ways Carnegie 
Mellon can support mem-
bers of the community who 
are experiencing food in-
security. Speci?cally, Basic 
Needs is looking to get sup-
port to meet the funding, 
space, and staf?ng needs of 
its proposal. Currently, it is 
looking to partner with the 
community food banks, 412 
Food Rescue, Student Lead-
ership, Involvement, and 
Civic Engagement (SLICE), 
Health, Wellness, and Din-
ing Services to make the 
food pantry a reality.
The current proposed 
model is similar to the food 
pantry operated by the 
University of Pittsburgh. 
The Pitt Pantry is a stu-
dent volunteer-run, shop-
through food pantry open 
to all of the Pitt community, 
including students, staff, 
and faculty. As part of our 
research, Basic Needs and 
the members of the Campus 
Food Insecurity Committee 
are in the process of tour-
ing the Pitt Pantry and gain-
ing a deeper understanding 
of its operations, and how 
those operations would 
translate to a similar pan-
try on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus.
Basic Needs hopes to 
begin marketing and hold-
ing events before the end 
of the semester. It is cur-
rently planning to host an 
end-of-the-year food drive 
and Entropy drive to col-
lect initial stock to be used 
once the pantry is open to 
the community. It is work-
ing towards having a ?rst 
iteration of the pantry open 
by next semester.
If you are interested 
in tackling basic needs is-
sues on campus, consider-
ing joining the Basic Needs 
Working Group! For more

Will Penman wins Three Minute Thesis
MARIKA YANG
Sports Editor
Carnegie Mellon 
University held its fifth an-
nual Three Minute Thesis 
(3MT) Championship 
last Tuesday, April 10, at 
Kresge Theater. The com-
petition challenges PhD 
students to orally present 
their thesis in three min-
utes in a way that is clear 
and interesting to a non-
expert audience. Prizes 
of $3,000, $2,000, and 
$1,000 are awarded to the 
first, second, and third 
place winners, decided by 
a panel of judges, as well 
as prizes of $500 that go 
to the People's Choice 
Award, selected by the live 
audience, and the Alumni 
Award.
The 3MT began at the 
University of Queensland 
in Australia in 2008 and 
has expanded all over the 
world in many univer-
sities. The competition 
is open to all doctoral 
students in any field at 
Carnegie Mellon. The 
2018 3MT group was as 
diverse as the school, with 
the eight finalists repre-
senting biology, architec-
ture, language, engineer-
ing, and English.
Will Penman of the 
department of English 
won first place and was 
voted the People's Choice 
Award. In second place 
was civil and environmen-
tal engineering student 
Navid Kazem, followed 
by Ardon Shorr of the 
Department of Biological 
Science in third place.
This year was Penman's 
second time participat-
ing in the 3MT, after 
competing last year.
"Last year I enjoyed 
competing, but I was 
pretty nervous in the final 
round," Penman said in an 
interview with The Tartan. 
"I wanted to come back 
this year with a more com-
fortable presentation and 
a more engaging talk. So, I 
decided to have fun with it 
this year and treat it more 
like a performance."
Penman's thesis is about 
the relationship between 
rhetoric and race, using 
the call-and-response 
method as a concrete com-
munication structure for 
enacting inclusive beliefs 
about race.
"I decided to struc-
ture my talk so that the 
audience wasn't just 
learning about call-and-
response, but actually 
trying it out," Penman 
said. "That way people 
could experience it for 
themselves."
Many of the the-
ses were interdisciplin-
ary in nature, drawing 
elements from several 
different fields. Second-
place winner Kazem's 
thesis integrates his civil 
and environmental en-
gineering field with me-
chanical engineering and 
physics to develop an in-
sulative and conductive 
rubber, dubbed "thub-
ber." Shorr's thesis dis-
cussed how scientists can 
use astronomy tools and 
techniques to learn about 
proteins — looking at 
proteins the same way we 
look at stars.
For Penman, the 3MT 
was an opportunity to 
hone his presentation 
skills and practice how to 
summarize and present 
his thesis. He also got the 
chance to learn about the 
eclectic research subjects 
of his fellow competitors.
"I was really impressed 
by the amazing work that 
Carnegie Mellon students 
do, and would encourage 
others to attend the finals 
next year," said Penman. 
"Each of the contestants 
has put in so much time 
to create a compelling 
presentation, and you 
really get a window into 
the work that people are 
doing."
the societal impact and 
economic side of things. 
He presented the claim 
that “work is not re-
placed when automation 
[occurs]” but continues, 
“what smart machines 
allow us to do is take a 
little time off.”
He added to this 
argument for increased 
leisure time critiques of 
America’s lack of wealth 
redistribution and pre-
sented policy recommen-
dations including the 
aforementioned, as well 
as worker retraining, 
shared labor, promo-
tion of human-machine 
complementarities, and 
intellectual property 
governance.
Conferences like this 
one serve three main 
roles, David Danks 
told The Tartan, that 
“they can serve to break 
down accidental barri-
ers between different 
communities,” allowing 
interdisciplinary stake-
holders to share ideas 
and connect, they can 
“help raise public aware-
ness and engagement on 
issues around ethics & 
AI,” and can “promote 
CMU’s leadership in the 
area of ethics and AI/
robotics.”
Despite having “over 
40 faculty [members] 
at Carnegie Mellon 
University working in 
this broad area,” Danks 
explains, Carnegie 
Mellon University has 
“never before held a 
major multidisciplinary 
event such as this one.” 
The conference is the first 
of hopefully many future 
events that serve an im-
portant role in keeping 
this massively important 
issue discussed and out 
of the shadows.
If you were not able 
to attend the conference 
and have interest in the 
contents, the confer-
ence website is archi-
val, containing all of the 
presentations from the 
conference, including 
the panel discussions, 
the keynote speech, and 
more. It is located at 
https://www.cmu.edu/
ethics-ai/agenda/web-
cast.html.
The 2020 conference 
does not have a published, 
confirmed date, but  is 
the next scheduled date 
for the K&L Gates con-
ference according to the 
closing remarks of the 
2018 conference. The 
conferences focus on 
subject matter that is 
sure to become only more 
impactful in our lives, so 
the goals of the confer-
ence and its importance 
will remain fitting in 
coming years.
You may be wondering, 
all these points are grand, 
but how can I — one single 
person — do anything to 
help prevent genocides?
“Don't be complacent,” 
answers professor Law. As 
a society, he asserts, peo-
ple need to be wary that 
anything from the past 
can come back. “I am very 
alarmed that the themes I 
developed in understand-
ing the 1920s and 1930s are 
so present in 2018. It keeps 
me up at night.”
Professor Aronson 
extended this point to our 
reception of the news. He 
warned never to assume 
that resolution in the news 
means a legitimate reso-
lution of the con?ict. “Be 
vigilant about not accept-
ing the ?rst story you hear.” 
It is important, Aaronson 
pushed, for everyone to 
pick topics that are impor-
tant to them and become 
citizen experts. “Be vigilant 
about trusting one source, 
especially when it validates 
your views.” Friedman not-
ed the con?ict between the 
Spanish and the Catalans as 
one to keep watching and 
added that, if you are bilin-
gual, reading the news of 
other counties' local papers 
in their local dialect is an 
important source to utilize.
Though the discussion 
was empowering, it fo-
cused primarily on staying 
informed about the hor-
rors of the world, which 
can take a toll on students. 
Aaronson took a moment 
to acknowledge the need 
for self-care in the pursuit 
of being informed. “One 
more piece of advice, keep 
your sanity. There is a sense 
of trauma that you receive 
from following the news 
today and seeing images. I 
would recommend taking 
breaks. The world won't 
stop spinning because you 
stop following the news for 
a day.”

The internship scram-
ble puts college students 
everywhere in the weird 
position of having to 
prove their worth to vari-

did not align with the 
number of struggles his 
friends had every year, 
looking to work at a start-

was something he could

with an early success. 
“One of my friends, his 
name is Connor, was 
looking for specifically 
an internship at a start-
up, hardware or soft-
ware, he was interested 
in tech," said Mirho. "So 
I connected him with one 
of my friends that I knew 
at an accelerator locally 
and he connected with a 
start-up, and he managed 
to get an internship and 
he actually had a lot of 
fun with it!" This led him 
to understand that being 
able to facilitate contact 
between students and 
businesses interested in 
hiring students might be 
a way in which he could 
ease the process, which 
is often stressful on all 
sides. He thought: "Hey, 
I’m contributing a little bit 
of value here, maybe I can 
actually do this on a larger 
scale, because it’s not too 
hard to reach out to com-
panies and it’s probably 
not too hard to reach out 
to students, and so I cre-
ated a little newsletter.”
Mirho has seen more 
success in the reaching 
out to companies front 
than he has in getting 
students involved in his 
newsletter. Mirho is trying 
to establish a network 
of students at Carnegie 
Mellon and the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, but he 
has seen some challenges 
establishing his base.
Mirho found that 
talking to companies 
that he made contact 
with through accelera-
tors or co-working spaces 
in Pittsburgh garners a 
more favorable response 
than students individu-
ally trying to contact 
companies. Though there 
is a need on the part of 
companies for student in-
terns, if they don’t reach 
out, it’s hard to figure 
out which which compa-
nies have that need. Says 
Mirho, “Sometimes you try 
to create that need on your 
own, you don’t know if a 
company needs something 
so you try to convince them 
you need me, I’m a good 
intern, I can help you a lot. 
It’s kind of a battle on both 
sides and for some reason 
reaching out on behalf of 
the general student popu-
lation and saying ‘Hey, if 
you have any internships 
open, I can post them here’ 
is a lot less irritating or in-
timidating to companies."
When asked about 
whether he is looking to 
expand into informing stu-
dents about opportunities 
at more established com-
panies, Mirho insisted 
that "the start-up focus is 
definitely key" due to the 
difficulty students gener-
ally have getting in touch 
with smaller businesses, 
because they don't have 
the infrastructure to reach 
out to students. Mirho ad-
vocates for the experience 
of working at a start-up, 
finding that the small team 
means you have contact 
with key decision makers 
"you have a much larger 
and versatile experience, 
it’s not like a larger compa-
ny where you are jammed 
into one specific role."

The Simpsons’ response to Apu controversy is dismissive
The Simpsons is far and away 
one of the most influential, 
well-recognized animated tele-
vision shows. The show has run 
for 29 seasons and counting 
and has racked up 31 Primetime 
Emmy Awards as well as nu-
merous other accolades, often 
earning a top spot on “greatest 
TV shows” lists.
But, The Simpsons has been 
more than just wildly success-
ful for the past few decades; 
since 1990, the show has been 
reinforcing a damaging stereo-
type of South Asians through 
the character of Apu Nahas-
apeemapetilon, the Indian 
owner of the “Kwik-E-Mart” 
convenience store. For a long 
time, Apu has not been widely 
considered an issue. However, 
last fall, a truTV documen-
tary called The Problem with 
Apu, written by Hari Kond-
abolu, brought the controver-
sy to light, exposing how the 
problematic character of Apu 
helped proliferate harmful ste-
reotypes. In the documentary, 
Kondabolu spoke with several 
other South Asian-American 
entertainers — including Aziz 
Ansari, Kal Penn, Aasif Mandvi, 
and Hasan Minhaj, and detailed 
his own experience living in the 
shadow of Apu. They traded 
stories of how the stereotype 
his character popularized has 
dominated their lives, from be-
ing constantly called “Apu” to 
hearing the character’s famous 
catchphrases shouted at them 
by strangers to being asked to 
deliver their lines “like Apu” 
while performing.
The documentary also high-
lighted the disturbing (but not 
entirely unsurprising) fact that 
Apu is voiced by a white man, 
Hank Azaria. Azaria, who 
also voices several 
other characters on 
the show, avoid-
ed answering 
questions for 
Kondabolu’s 
documenta-
ry, but has 
addressed 
the is-
sue in 
the past. 
In a 2013 
Huffing-
ton Post 
interview, 
he stated 
that “[he re-
ally does] love 
the character and 
[does] try to do 
right by him accent-
wise and character-wise” 
but that he did “understand 
why people could have been 
offended or upset, and [he’s] 
sorry for that.”
On Sunday, the creators 
of The Simpsons finally ad-
dressed the controversy in 
a new episode. However,  
instead of acknowledging 
their mistake, the show’s 
dismissive response de-
flected the blame to an 
over-eager politically cor-
rect culture. In the scene, 
Marge, the mother of the 
Simpson family, reads a 
book to her daughter Lisa 
that she has edited to make 
less culturally offensive. 
Lisa then looks directly at 
the camera and states, 
“Something that started 
decades ago and was 
applauded and inoffensive 
is now politically incorrect.” 
As she looks at a picture of 
Apu with Bart’s catchphrase, 
“Don’t have a cow!” written 
alongside it, she asks, “What 
can you do?” Marge then of-
fers a cryptic response, saying, 
“Some things will be dealt with 
at a later date.” “If it all,” Lisa 
adds, before the scene comes 
to a close.
Many people instantly 
criticized the show, with 
Kondabolu tweeting, “Wow. 
‘Politically Incorrect?’ That’s 
the takeaway from my movie & 
the discussion it sparked? Man, 
I really loved this show. This is 
sad.” He later also tweeted: “In 
The Problem with Apu, I used 
Apu & The Simpsons as an entry 
point into a larger conversa-
tion about the representation 
of marginalized groups & why 
this is important. The Simp-
sons’ response tonight is not a 
jab at me, but at what many of 
us consider progress.”
However, the biggest issue, 
with The Simpsons’ response to 
the controversy is that it is yet 
another attempt to normalize 
the stereotype. The show has 
been doing this since Apu was 
introduced, and much of the 
reason derives from the show’s 
structure. The satire-based 
show seems to revolve around 
stereotypes with many of the 
characters fitting directly into 
them — such as Ned Flanders 
(the goofy, overly-friendly 
neighbor); Chief Wiggum (the 
donut-eating, lazy, negligent 
cop); or Mayor Quimby (the 
power-hungry, opportunistic 
politician). Many of the show’s 
jokes riff off of these stereo-
types. The character of Apu also 
fits directly into a stereotype, 
but while Flanders, Wiggum, 
and Quimby all conform to oc-
cupational stereotypes, Apu’s 
is a product of his race. De-
spite this crucial difference, the 
show does not approach Apu’s 
stereotype in a different way, 
and therefore attempts to make 
a blatantly discriminatory ste-
reotype seem acceptable.
The Simpsons’ recent re-
sponse tries to do the same 
thing. Lisa’s line “Something 
that started decades ago and 
was applauded and inoffen-
sive is now politically incor-
rect” is particularly troubling. 
Here — via the show’s writers 
— she is essentially arguing 
that because something has 
been accepted and praised 
before, it should not be criti-
cized now. By looking to the 
past, The Simpsons tries to 
make the stereotype appear 
normal. But like Kondabolu 
declared in his tweet, this 
form of normalization is a 
dismissal of “what many of us 
consider progress.”
This argument in favor of 
tradition and the normaliza-
tion of what was considered 
acceptable in the past shares a 
lot in common with the “make 
America great again” ideals of 
many on the far right. Much 
of what they are fighting 
for stems from preserv-
ing what has been 
established and 
preventing po-
litical correct-
ness from 
spreading. 
While this 
is not to as-
sume that 
any of The 
Simpsons 
writ-
ers sub-
scribe 
to this 
political 
ideol-
ogy, their 
excuse for 
keeping 
around a 
damaging 
and hurtful 
stereotype 
echoes the 
far right’s 
claims, with 
an attempt to 
look to the past 
for what was con-
sidered normal and 
socially acceptable.
Perhaps even more 
ominous are the final lines 
of the scene. While Marge’s 
line, “Some things will be dealt 
with at a later date” suggests a 
glimmer of hope, Lisa’s follow-
up, “If it all,” immediately casts 
doubt on whether The Simpsons 
will ever fully acknowledge the 
harm that Apu’s stereotype has 
caused and if it will ever make 
a change.
By looking to 
the past, The 
Simpsons is trying 
to make the 
stereotype appear 
normal.

Being a Ken is just as dif?cult and unattainable as being a Barbie

What comes to mind when you 
think of eating disorders? What-
ever type you may think of, the 
stereotype of a frail, white girl is 
the picture for most of us. But, 
what about an overweight male? 
An Asian with a healthy Body Mass 
Index (BMI) but has self-destruc-
tive eating habits? A queer black 
person whose obsession with exer-
cise and clean eating intrudes daily 
life? Those images probably don’t 
come as intuitively, but the statis-
tics say you may need to reconsider 
your prototype.
At the National Eating Disorder 
Association (NEDA) Walk on April 
7, at Schenley Park, the lack of 
inclusiveness in the dialogue for 
eating disorders was explicitly 
brought up. One of the speakers 
at the event shared her journey 
of suffering and recovering from 
an eating disorder. She concluded 
her speech by questioning how her 
journey towards recovering may 
have differed if she did not fall into 
the traditional prototype of a per-
son with an eating disorder. She 
probed whether she would have 
been treated the same way if she 
were in the LGBTQ+ community, 
male, a racial minority, or not ema-
ciated. Her speech called for a de-
mand for intersectional dialogue 
on eating disorders: one that sees 
no barriers from qualities such as 
race, gender, or sexuality.
I observed the attendees of the 
walk. Most were female, and the 
few males who were in the crowd 
were walking women and carry-
ing posters saying they walked for 
their ?ancee or girlfriend. Perhaps 
the lack of male attendance lies in 
men showing solidarity and sup-
port through different means than 
women do. However, I could not 
help but wonder how many suf-
ferers are out there and cast aside 
because they do not ?t into the 
prototype and fear they may be 
treated or perceived as anyone but 
someone who suffers from a criti-
cal medical condition.
The reach of the lack of inclu-
siveness does not stop 
at a single walk. At 
various health cen-
ters on and near 
campus such as 
the University of 
Pittsburgh Medi-
cal Center (UPMC) 
and University 
Health Services 
(UHS), I have 
seen ?yers 
about a group 
therapy pro-
gram geared 
towards 
women who 
suffer from 
eating dis-
orders. I 
under-
stand 
that gen-
der can 
play a 
role in 
health 
and 
recovery. Wom-
en may feel more 
comfortable open-
ing up and may get 
more out of therapy 
if there is a treat-
ment group with 
women who can bet-
ter understand the 
psychological and 
physical toll that eat-
ing disorders take. 
However, never once 
have I seen either 
healthcare centers 
show any support 
for men with eating 
disorders. Getting 
help is hard enough; 
men should not have to face the 
additional obstacle of not having 
resources available.
One may argue that there isn’t 
one for men because more women 
are impacted by eating disorders. 
However, as of 2016, over one-
third of people with a diagnosable 
eating disorder are male. As many 
mental illnesses go undiag-
nosed, it would come as no 
surprise if the number of 
men who are not diag-
nosed with eating dis-
orders but need treat-
ment was signi?cant 
enough to skew these 
numbers. Psychia-
trist Kimberli 
McCallum 
estimates that up to 80 percent 
of men with eating disorders 
go around undiagnosed. Before 
thinking of eating disorders, many 
doctors might say the culprit of the 
health problems is gastrointestinal 
problems or thyroid problems. The 
apparent lack of participation or 
demand for such a sup-
port group may lie 
heavily on diagno-
ses going unknown 
and not having 
treatments inac-
cessible for many 
men.
Furthermore, we 
must acknowl-
edge that un-
realistic beauty 
standards are 
not exclusive to 
women. We are 
all familiar and 
conscious of 
the standards 
imposed on 
women: pic-
ture a skinny 
hourglass 
body and 
with a 
thigh 
gap 
grazing 
the cov-
er of Sports 
Illustrated or on 
the runway. 
Most of us are 
aware of the ex-
tent Photoshop 
is used to en-
hance photos 
of women. The 
rise in aware-
ness has led to 
companies such 
as Target and 
Aerie to have 
photoshop-
free models, 
advertising them as “real” wom-
en. Although we should maintain 
transparency when it comes to 
Photoshop usage in magazines and 
social media, where is the aware-
ness of male beauty standards and 
photoshopped male models?
Think of the “ideal” male body: 
lean and muscular usually pops 
into mind. However, how many 
ad campaigns have you seen go-
ing against that grain? In order to 
achieve that ideal male body, men 
often have to sacri?ce their mental 
and physical health. Bodybuilders 
boast their low body fat percent-
age, which can go even lower than 
?ve percent. To put that number 
in perspective, the average male 
body fat percentage lies around 15 
to 20 percent, three percent being 
absolutely vital. Although most of 
them do not keep that ratio when 
they are not in the limelight, they 
are being presented as people with 
sustainable and attainable bod-
ies. Consequently, men can be put 
under the notion that they, too, 
should reach these ideals. Men’s 
struggle to reach these unsus-
tainable bodies mirror those that 
women face when reaching their 
respective “ideal” bodies: coldness, 
low energy, negative change in 
mood, and poorer physical health, 
to name a few.
Eating disorders are the dead-
liest mental illnesses. To combat 
this, we must not look at one de-
mographic who suffers; we must 
reach out to all who suffer. In order 
to do so, we must remain cogni-
zant of factors that impact not just 
women but men. We must keep 
dialogue and resources open and 
accessible to anyone regardless of 
their identity. Fighting an eating 
disorder is hard enough by itself; 
we should not implement barriers 
that make it even more dif?cult for 
others to recover.

The city of Pittsburgh is 
doing something terrible in 
East Liberty, and I am com-
pletely against it.
About three years ago, the 
developer company, LG Realty, 
gave, without warning, a 90-
day eviction notice to residents 
of Penn Plaza located in East 
Liberty, about ten minutes 
away from Carnegie Mellon. 
And in the face of heavy re-
sistance by residents, LG Re-
alty tore down an apartment 
and displaced more than 500 
residents. These residents are 
everyday people who have 
spent their lives enriching 
Pittsburgh. They hoped that 
one day they could watch their 
children grow up in a city they 
call home. That dream has 
been deferred as residents lost 
their right to shelter and were 
forced to scatter across the city, 
county, and beyond. The Pitts-
burgh city government gave no 
promise that residents could 
return to East Liberty, and so to 
this day, the residents struggle 
to find housing in a city that 
lacks affordable housing and 
fight to rebuild the homes that 
were lost at Penn Plaza.
A few weeks ago, LG Realty 
came forward with their re-
development plan. Their plan 
is to build (and these are the 
architect’s words) an office 
building shaped like a wedding 
cake. There are zero housing 
units inside this “cake.” There 
are no plans to create afford-
able units. There is no promise 
that displaced residents can re-
turn home. It is appalling that 
LG Realty would release a plan 
without housing affordable for 
those displaced residents. It is 
appalling that the city would 
allow the developer to release 
this plan.
The city is looking ahead 
and its vision does not include 
these residents. When the city 
planners sleep, they dream of 
a rich city full of young, tal-
ented professionals, hailing 
from all over the country. They 
dream of a city that grows big-
ger and bigger, year after year. 
They dream of big buildings, 
skyscrapers labeled “Amazon.” 
And when they wake up, they 
will spend as many resources 
as possible to make their 
dreams come true while cur-
rent residents struggle to pay 
rising rents and property taxes.
So it’s unsurprising that the 
former Penn Plaza residents 
joined citizens of Pittsburgh 
to raise hell at the Penn Plaza 
Luxury Development Public 
Meeting two weeks ago. They 
are fighting for their right to 
live and to exist in Pittsburgh. 
They understand what it means 
if they do not stand up and re-
sist, for every neighborhood 
will receive the same treatment 
as Penn Plaza if the people can-
not make their voices heard.
The battle for Penn Plaza is 
a classic battle where one side 
is hoping to get rich and the 
other side wants their human 
dignity affirmed. The people of 
Pittsburgh deserve better.
I, too, must also play an ac-
tive role in the battle for Penn 
Plaza. As a Carnegie Mellon 
student, I recognize that for the 
Pittsburgh city government, I 
am their prize. They want peo-
ple like myself: someone who 
can one day work at a big tech 
company, someone who hopes 
to start a family in the next ten 
years, someone who will in-
crease tax revenue and improve 
school systems as my children 
and I grow old in the next thirty 
years. We Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents must be aggressive and 
call out our representatives on 
these issues because they will 
follow us wherever they go. 
Pittsburgh is not the only city 
that will plunder the wallets 
of poor people only to disown 
them. Every major city has com-
mitted this legal crime in the 
name of development and we 
need to draw the line and pro-
tect our own.
I don’t know what the so-
lutions are but we can begin 
by assisting ongoing efforts. 
On Apr. 16, 5:30 p.m. at 250 
N. Highland Ave, there will 
be another public meeting on 
the Penn Plaza redevelopment 
plan. Attend and voice your 
concern and discontent. City 
planners are far more likely to 
listen to you because remem-
ber, you are the prize. Look 
up the Penn Plaza Support Ac-
tion group. They are in con-
stant need of help. You can 
lend enormous assistance by 
virtue of your energy and con-
nections. I know this because I 
am part of the group. You can 
reach out to me to join. There, 
you already know one person.
In the long-run, these prob-
lems cannot be solved if the res-
idents are not heard. The city 
government needs to go back 
to the drawing board and take 
the residents, the people they 
serve, seriously. The residents 
must be part of the decision-
making process so they can 
represent themselves as stake-
holders and force compromises 
with the developer.  
Such a relationship al-
ready exists in Pittsburgh. 
In the Hill District, residents 
forged a Community Benefits 
Agreement with the city of 
Pittsburgh and the developer 
in the area. In this agreement, 
Hill District residents gain bar-
gaining and oversight power 
over the developer. They also 
receive a significant amount of 
resources for community devel-
opment and gain priority over 
all other non-local residents for 
good, well-paying jobs. These 
types of agreements are what 
the city needs to prioritize to 
re-center residents in the com-
munity development process. 
This is what community devel-
opment looks like.
Unfortunately, there is zero 
indication that the city wants 
to put residents in the center of 
the development process. The 
city planners would rather take 
fate away from the hands of 
people. If the city continues its 
current trajectory and ignores 
its people, then I will leave 
after I graduate. I will not let 
the city claim me as a prize. I 
will not live in a city that be-
trays its people. I will not live 
in a city that actively swaps its 
poor residents for wealthier 
people out-of-state. I will not 
live in a city that does not re-
spect its poor people and its 
black people. You are welcome 
to join me.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: A RESPONSE TO THE TARTAN
Wilson Ekern and Adam Tun-
nard presented an important front-
page piece in The Tartan’s April 2 
issue, covering a visit from Newt 
Ginrich. Mr. Ginrich’s visit to Carn-
egie Mellon University brought to-
gether important voices in policy 
and technology and, I’m sure, posed 
a unique challenge to the staff of 
The Tartan to provide productive, 
neutral reporting. Let’s see how the 
writers did.
There are (at least) three, funda-
mental components of a story that 
responsible reporting covers: (1) 
facts, (2) context, (3) ias. 
(1) Did Ekern and Tunnard pro-
vide accurate information about Mr. 
Ginrich’s visit? Yes. No problems here. 
(2) Did Ekern and Tunnard put 
Mr. Ginrich’s visit in context? Yes. For 
example, they mention that Director 
Skinner, who invited Mr. Ginrich to 
speak, worked on Mr. Ginrich’s presi-
dential campaign in 2012. 
(3) Did Ekern and Tunnard con-
trol for bias? Hell. No. 
But wait! They spend almost 
the entire second half of their piece 
pointing out Mr. Ginrich’s bias! 
What more can you ask for?
What I ask for is that the staff 
of The Tartan control for reporting 
bias. Consider how Ekern and Tun-
nard point out one of Mr. Ginrich’s 
controversial claims:
“[Mr. Ginrich’s] equating of (sic) 
fracking technology to the work 
being done in nanotechnology or 
AI here at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity is a somewhat dubious claim, 
as fracking has certainly not been as 
?awless as the portrait he paints.” 
Look closely. That is propaganda. 
Not for liberal, environmental pro-
gressivism, and certainly not for Mr. 
Ginrich’s version of conservativism. 
It is propaganda for Carnegie Mellon 
University. Let me leave you with an 
equivalent translation of the argument 
that Ekern and Tunnard present:
“Fracking is not like CMU be-
cause fracking isn’t perfect.”
When I went to address this letter, 
I found the following statement: “The 
Tartan is not an of?cial publication of 
Carnegie Mellon University.” I chal-
lenge you, the writers and editors of 
The Tartan, to report responsibly.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: ON THE CONCEALED CARRY AGREEMENT
Concealed Carry Reciprocity is 
a quiet Federal Level agreement to 
force all States and Territories to rec-
ognize each other’s concealed carry 
laws.
The leadership of the National 
Ri?e Association has been telling its 
members that this is a good thing.  
Representative Richard Hudson 
from North Carolina introduced 
it into the House of Representa-
tives based on an incident where a 
woman from Philadelphia, Penn-
sylvania drove to Atlantic City, New 
Jersey with a concealed weapon,  
was stopped for some reason, and 
arrested for carrying a hidden gun.  
She said she didn’t know New Jersey 
does not recognize Pennsylvania’s 
concealed carry laws even though 
she lived in Pennsylvania and 
worked in New Jersey.
A North Carolina politician who 
apparently espouses states’ rights 
got upset about a woman heading 
into the gambling dens of Atlantic 
City from Philadelphia with a hid-
den weapon.  He appeared angry 
because those two states, neither of 
which he represents, don’t recognize 
each others’ concealed gun laws.
Mr. Hudson comes from a quaint 
and quiet region in North Carolina.  
Very little manufacturing, no orga-
nized gambling, lots of farms, strug-
gling economy and poor education 
opportunities.  At least he did one 
thing in Congress even if it wasn’t for 
the people he represents.
Concealed Carry Reciprocity is 
the ?rst step in the creation of a Na-
tional Police Force that would dis-
place and control local law enforce-
ment.  It would allow the Federal 
Government to leapfrog State and 
County governments and crush local 
control.
Does anyone have anything else 
for Mr. Hudson to do?

CEE researchers’ smart sensors can help prevent falls
ROSE EILENBERG
Junior Staffwriter
Smart buildings are no 
longer restricted to the 
realm of Disney Channel 
original movies. 
Dr. Hae Young Noh, an 
assistant professor in the 
Civil and Environmen-
tal Engineering (CEE) 
department at Carnegie 
Mellon University, works 
on “structures as sensors” 
— that is, embedding sen-
sors in buildings and other 
objects so they can tell us 
what the humans in and 
around them are doing.
Vibrations in buildings 
are often thought of as a 
nuisance, but according 
to Dr. Noh’s team, they 
actually contain a lot of 
information. 
One promising appli-
cation of this informa-
tion is location tracking. 
Whether it be in a retail 
store, a bank, or a hospi-
tal, we often want to know 
where people are, and 
what they are doing with-
out having to keep an eye 
on them ourselves, accord-
ing to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release.
The researchers use 
sensors called geophones, 
which measure vibrations 
and convert them into 
voltages. 
Because the vibrations 
from footsteps are often 
very small, it can be easy 
to miss a few. So, they use 
an ampli?er to make sure 
they capture the signal 
from each individual step.
It takes a certain 
amount of time for a vibra-
tion to propagate through 
the ?oor and reach each 
sensor, depending on how 
far the sensor is from the 
location of the footstep. 
The system measures the 
difference in the time it 
takes for that signal to ar-
rive at each sensor; with 
four sensors, it can ?gure 
out where a person is 
walking, accurate within 
about a foot.
These systems don’t 
just measure location; 
they can also tell us a lot 
about the walker’s gait. Dr. 
Noh’s sensors can be cali-
brated to measure walking 
speed, stride length, and 
how much force is asso-
ciated with each step, to 
within ?ve percent of the 
individual’s body weight.
This aspect of the sys-
tem makes it a promising 
tool to protect the elderly 
from dangerous falls when 
it’s installed in buildings.
Elderly folks with im-
balances in their walking 
patterns are almost three 
times more likely to fall 
than those without. 
There are many differ-
ent tests to measure gait 
imbalance, but they are of-
ten subjective and require 
a lot of direct attention 
from the evaluator. Re-
cently, more technological 
approaches have emerged, 
such as pressure-sensing 
mats, 3D video capture, 
and wearable devices. 
These solutions aren’t 
perfect. They might be 
restricted to speci?c rooms 
full of sensors, or require 
direct interaction from the 
user.
One advantage of Dr. 
Noh’s system is that it re-
quires relatively few sen-
sors, and can quantify the 
imbalance, while other 
methods are often only 
qualitative. 
Another advantage is 
that it is completely unob-
trusive — it only needs to 
be present in the room in 
order to do its job.
The system needs to 
be calibrated for each 
new location, because of 
all the possible different 
types and con?gurations 
of ?oors.

Sweet potato beat humans to Paci?c by 100,000 years
For years, it’s been 
thought that determining 
how long ago the sweet po-
tato took root in Polynesia 
would reveal when ancient 
South Americans and Paci?c 
Islanders ?rst encountered 
each other. Anthropologists 
are interested in this ques-
tion because when Euro-
peans arrived in Polynesia, 
they saw plenty of sweet 
potatoes — native to South 
America — growing on the 
Paci?c islands. Many believe 
they were brought there by 
Polynesian sailors who made 
trips to South America.
But, that may not neces-
sarily be the case. A new 
genetic analysis, published 
April 12 in Current Biol-
ogy, appears to indicate that 
sweet potatoes actually ar-
rived in the Paci?c about 
100,000 years ago, without 
human help. Sweet potato 
seeds are able to sprout even 
after exposure to salt water, 
and could easily have been 
carried by birds.
However, anthropolo-
gists are not taking this as 
evidence that ancient Poly-
nesians and South Ameri-
cans never met.
“This paper shows sweet 
potatoes were already in 
Polynesia when the islands 
were ?rst colonized by hu-
mans thousands of years 
ago,” says Lars Fehren-
Schmitz, a paleogeneticist 
at the University of Califor-
nia, Santa Cruz. “But it can’t 
prove there was no contact 
between Polynesians and 
South Americans before 
Europeans arrived.”

Cargo ships must cut emissions in half by 2050
In a ?rst for the ship-
ping industry, a new United 
Nations deal will restrict the 
greenhouse gas emissions of 
cargo ships.
The tens of thousands of 
cargo ships that transport 
goods around the world 
each year have primarily 
been powered by heavy fuel 
oil since the 1960s. Accord-
ing to James Corbett, an ex-
pert in global shipping at the 
University of Delaware in 
Newark, heavy fuel oil con-
tains 1,800 times as much 
sulfur as diesel fuel.
The fuel burned by car-
go ships produces two to 
three percent of greenhouse 
gas emissions annually — 
roughly the same amount as 
Germany. The 2015 Paris cli-
mate accord did not address 
these emissions.
The U.N.’s International 
Maritime Organization 
(IMO) is working to rectify 
that, with a new deal rati?ed 
April 13 by 170 nations. The 
plan is to reduce cargo ship 
greenhouse gas emissions 
below 50 percent of 2008 
levels. The IMO plan encour-
ages shipping companies 
to reduce emissions with 
more energy-ef?cient ship 
designs, cleaner fuels, and 
better business practices.
According to Veronica 
Frank, an adviser to Green-
peace, the restrictions are 
“far from perfect, but the 
direction is now clear — a 
phaseout of carbon emis-
sions.”
“Clearly the IMO is mov-
ing into the 21st century,” 
says Corbett.

Record numbers of scientists running for of?ce
As cities across America 
prepare for the second 
March for Science, hundreds 
of scientists are running for 
of?ce around the country at 
the local, state, and federal 
levels.
Scientist-candidates cite 
the current political climate 
as the main reason they are 
seeking election, pointing 
out that the current admin-
istration has a tendency to 
reject scienti?c evidence.
“The attacks on science 
certainly didn’t start with 
Trump,” says Ted Bordelon, 
spokesperson for advocacy 
group 314 Action. “But he 
has been a huge catalyst. 
That may be one of the 
bright spots of his presiden-
cy — more scientists saying 
they want to be in the ring 
when it comes to lawmak-
ing.”
“After Trump was elected, 
I thought, ‘I have a nice job, 
I’m tenured, I’m safe,’ but I 
felt so pessimistic,” explains 
physicist Elaine DeMasi, 
running to represent New 
York’s First Congressional 
District.
For many of these can-
didates, science is its own 
platform. “Evidence-based 
politics is what I care about. 
I don’t care if it comes from 
the right or the left or the 
other right or the other left. 
As scientists, we are trained 
to prove ourselves wrong,” 
she says. “Government 
should have the same open 
mind.”

Measuring the pressure in-
side the skull — called intra-
cranial pressure — is essential 
for properly and safely treating 
traumatic brain injuries. Carn-
egie Mellon researchers Jana 
Kainerstorfer and Alexander 
Ruesch have developed a new 
way to monitor intracranial pres-
sure that is far less invasive than 
current methods.
Traumatic brain injuries, 
often caused by car accidents, 
falls, or infections, are common 
but dangerous. When a patient 
suffers a traumatic brain injury, 
their brain can swell, cutting off 
blood vessels and doing brain 
damage that can be permanent 
or even fatal.
Doctors can watch out for the 
signs of swelling by monitoring 
intracranial pressure. This usual-
ly means performing surgery to 
drill a hole in the patient’s skull, 
a procedure that is both involved 
and invasive.
Kainerstorfer, an assistant 
professor in the Biomedical 
Engineering department, and 
Ruesch, her PhD student, are 
working on implementing a less 
invasive procedure that uses 
light to measure intracranial 
pressure.
Their method uses optical ?-
bers to send near infrared light 
into the brain, where it pene-
trates the skin and skull to reach 
blood vessels. Some of the light 
is re?ected back out. By measur-
ing the proportion of light that’s 
re?ected, they can monitor 
changes in the amount of blood 
?owing through the brain. 
As in the current standard 
monitoring procedure, doctors 
can intervene if that amount 
dips below healthy levels.
“If we can replace a very 
risky, invasive surgery and still 
get the information we need 
by shining light into a patient’s 
head, that would be much safer 
and much more cost-ef?cient. A 
non-invasive approach would be 
helpful for patients who are bed-
ridden and need their brain to 
be constantly monitored. With 
our system, physicians won’t 
have to worry about jeopardiz-
ing the safety of their patients,” 
said Ruesch in a university news 
release.
Kainerstorfer and Ruesch will 
soon implement their method to 
help pediatric brain trauma pa-
tients recover  at the Children’s 
Hospital of Pittsburgh.
Brain health can be tracked with light

But, because they know 
the way waves propagate 
through solid materials, if 
the team can identify the 
?oor’s structural proper-
ties, they can ?gure out 
how strong the original 
force was. From there, 
they can compare the forc-
es from steps on someone’s 
right and left foot.
The system can be 
trained to use the infor-
mation gathered to pre-
dict when a person’s gait 
is deteriorating, which is 
a big predictor of fall risk. 
One potential application 
is a warning system for an 
individual, a sort of alarm 
saying “don’t push your-
self.” They can also de-
sign a system that noti?es 
emergency responders and 
family members, even if 
the person is unconscious.
These types of sensing 
systems aren’t restricted to 
?oors — the team is also 
testing the use of such sen-
sors on beds. 
Dr. Noh, along with Dr. 
Pei Zhang, Associate Pro-
fessor of Computer Engi-
neering, and several doc-
toral students, will install 
the sensors for testing in a 
local hospital. The sensors 
measure the vibrations in 
the bed frame as its occu-
pant moves around, and 
the program can be trained 
to identify their intent: are 
they trying to get up, or 
just roll over?
Roughly one million 
patients fall in hospitals 
each year. It isn’t always 
possible to have staff mon-
itoring patients who are 
at high risk for falls, but 
with this system, a nurse 
or caregiver can be noti?ed 
in time to reach the patient 
and prevent a potentially 
serious injury.
“Smart building” sensor tech has many applications

Crosby has a hat trick, Pens take Game 1 over Flyers 
FEATURE PHOTO
PENGUINS, from A10
Even seeing the goal 
from the middle of the upper 
bowl, it was clear to me how 
incredible what Crosby had 
done was. The crowd darted 
to the replay, and as the slow-
motion video played for the 
?rst time, the crowd gasped 
again, before rising into the 
loudest uproar of the night. 
For the rest of the game, 
chants of “Sidney Crosby” 
persisted. It certainly did not 
hurt that he followed that up 
with two more goals, one of 
them being another — but 
slightly less impressive — 
mid-air de?ection.
I left the arena Wednesday 
night with the impression 
that the Penguins would 
sweep the Flyers in four 
short games. Philadelphia’s 
offense looked completely 
static, and the defense 
and goaltending appeared 
helpless against Pittsburgh’s 
unforgiving attack. So I 
was shocked following the 
score of Game 2 from my 
phone Friday night. The 
Flyers pulled ahead to a 2-0 
start through two periods, 
and added a third goal just 
90 seconds into the third 
period.
The Penguins, unable 
to score, were visibly 
frustrated. Crosby slammed 
his stick into the opposing 
net as the end of the second 
period sounded, having just 
barely missed a great scoring 
chance. If Game 1 saw 
the Pens as a consistently 
dominant team steamrolling 
their rivals, then Game 2 
exempli?ed the exhaustion 
of playing through long 
regular seasons and four 
grueling rounds of playoff 
hockey for two years in a 
row catching up to them. 
Philadelphia was the more 
physical team in Game 2 as 
well, and even if it took a 
questionable Claude Giroux 
hit on Kris Letang, the Flyers 
won the mental battle of 
Game 2.
Now, the Penguins travel 
to a bloodthirsty Wells 
Fargo Center in Philadelphia 
for Games 2 and 3, with an 
even series score and a chip 
on their shoulder. This is 
going to be a great series.

On Wednesday night, 
the Pittsburgh Penguins 
hit the ice to start the 
2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs, 
as they seek to capture 
their third consecutive 
championship.
Their quest this 
year began against the 
Philadelphia Flyers, the 
Pens’ ?erce in-state rival. 
Crosby and company 
handled the Flyers deftly 
in Game 1, scoring a 
dominant seven goals 
and shutting down 
Philadelphia’s offense 
altogether, holding them 
to just 24 shots. Goaltender 
Matt Murray completed the 
shutout, allowing no goals 
on a series of stellar saves.
The game was a non-
stop parade of Pittsburgh 
sports dominance, and the 
atmosphere in the arena 
re?ected that. From the 
?rst puck drop, it was clear 
the Pens were more lively 
than the Flyers, and the 
crowd at PPG Paints Arena 
fed into that energy. With 
some key players injured 
from the start, Philadelphia 
came onto the ice looking 
jaded and demoralized. 
Game 1 ate them up, and 
the Penguins’ two-time 
defending championship 
team looked as strong as 
ever.
Being at Game 1 
Wednesday night, the 
veteran talent really 
stood out to me. Evgeni 
Malkin danced around 
defenders to score in the 
?rst period with weightless 
skating that reminded 
me of Connor McDavid. 
Assists from Kris Letang, 
Derick Brassard and Patric 
Hornqvist were snappy 
and played to modern NHL 
tendencies.
And then, there was 
Sidney Crosby. Crosby had 
a hat trick and he didn’t 
even score until the second 
period for Pittsburgh’s 5th 
goal of the game. That 
goal was a dazzling no-
look mid-air de?ection that 
seemed to defy the laws of 
physics. Crosby has made a 
few mid-air goals this year, 
a skill he seems to have 
improved even at 30 years 
old.
But Wednesday night’s 
de?ection was special. The 
puck moved at near full 
speed to Crosby’s left, with 
his back turned away from 
the goal. Without looking 
to the net, he batted the 
puck when it passed his 
side, and it sailed over

The Carnegie Mellon 
University Baseball 
Analytics Workshop was 
held last Saturday, April 7. 
It was the first installment 
in what Carnegie Mellon’s 
Department of Statistics & 
Data Science hopes to be 
a series of workshops that 
deal with sports analytics. 
Around 60 participants 
of all ages gathered to 
learn some of baseball 
statisticians’ tools of the 
trade.
Mark Patterson, Director 
of the Quantitative Social 
Science Scholars Program 
at Carnegie Mellon, 
gave the participants 
an introduction to R 
and RStudio, a statistics 
program that can be 
used to do a plethora of 
fun things with baseball 
data. Patterson walked 
the group through the 
massive Lahman package, 
an immense data dump of 
season-to-season statistics 
for both players and teams. 
Patterson showed the 
group a few ways to plot 
different baseball metrics 
such as home runs, walks, 
and strikeouts.
After lunch, Jim Albert, 
Bowling Green State 
University professor in 
mathematics and statistics, 
gave the afternoon’s 
keynote speech on the 
topic of new developments 
in advanced statistical 
analysis in baseball, 
specifically what can be 
done with PitchFX and 
Statcast. PitchFX provides 
analysis on every single 
pitch that’s thrown in a 
baseball game. Multiple 
variables are recorded, 
like location, movement, 
and velocity. Statcast, 
introduced in 2015, 
analyzes players and player 
movement on the field. 
Things like launch angle, 
exit velocity, and other 
“hot” statistics becoming 
more prominently 
discussed are because of 
Statcast’s integration into 
MLB stadiums.
Ron Yurko, a Ph.D. 
student in statistics at 
Carnegie Mellon, led the 
group through a more 
advanced exploration 
of RStudio. Because the 
Pittsburgh Pirates 
were due to play the 
Cincinnati Reds later that 
day, Yurko took a look at 
Reds first baseman Joey 
Votto’s statistics, creating 
a few different graphics 
in RStudio. He analyzed 
things like Votto’s OPS and 
Whiff rate in 2017 varied 
by pitch type, learning that 
Votto does incredibly well 
when trying to hit sinkers 
and curveballs.
Yurko also created a 
heat map of where Votto 
was most likely to swing 
at pitches. Because Votto 
has incredible discipline 
as a hitter, his strike zone 
heat map was hot in the 
strike zone, and it sharply 
cooled off outside the 
strike zone. To compare, 
Yurko referenced the 
heat map of Reds 
center fielder Billy 
Hamilton, whose 
swing probabilities 
extended well 
outside the strike zone. 
Finally, Yurko brought 
up a spray chart of where 
Votto’s batted balls were 
most likely to land.
After the presentation, 
the group traveled to 
PNC Park for a pregame 
Q&A session with Pirates 
Director of Baseball 
Informatics Dan Fox and 
his analytics staff, where 
they answered many 
questions concerning 
their day-to-day workflow, 
resume advice, and 
personal opinions on 
baseball statistics.
After the session, those 
who were a bit more daring 
stayed to catch a chilly 
game between the Pirates 
and the Reds. Ultimately, 
the Bucs fell 7–4.
Penguins off to hot playoff start
Stats and baseball go hand in hand

The NBA Playoffs are 
already underway! What 
is in store this year? Will 
anyone break the Cavs-
Warriors finals? Or, 
will the two teams meet 
for the fourth time in a 
row (Warriors lead the 
“championship series” 
2-1)? Can the Rockets 
finally break through? 
Here are The Tartan’s NBA 
Playoffs Predictions.
Eastern Conference
The East definitely has 
less star power than the 
West, but it does have one 
star above the rest: LeBron 
James of the Cleveland 
Cavaliers. In his 15th NBA 
season at age 33, James 
hasn’t shown any sign of 
letting up. He has been 
playing all 82 games for 
the first time, leading in 
minutes per game, and 
posting career numbers. He 
is defying all expectations, 
is continuing to be the 
best player in basketball, 
and is vying for his eighth 
straight finals appearance. 
It wouldn’t be surprising if 
he can carry the Cavs to the 
finals yet again.
Before all the injuries, 
first to Gordon Hayward 
in the fall and recently to 
Kyrie Irving, the Boston 
Celtics were on track to 
make a deep playoff push. 
The team’s early success 
helped secure them the 
number 2 seed in the East, 
but the path through Round 
1 against the Milwaukee 
Bucks won’t be a breather.
And finally, we have 
the red-hot Philadelphia 
76ers, coming off their 16-
game winning streak that 
finished their season. Even 
with their best player Joel 
Embiid out with a friendly-
fire injury, the Sixers are 
young, hungry, and ready 
to win. This team is young: 
inevitable rookie of the 
year Ben Simmons has been 
impressive this season, and 
even 2017 first round pick 
Markelle Fultz has battled 
back from injury to be 
effective off the bench. 
The Sixers are a breath of 
fresh air, and Philadelphia 
is ready to sweep sports 
championships after the 
Eagles took the Super 
Bowl, and Villanova won 
the NCAA men’s basketball 
tournament.
Western Conference
Here are the stars. The 
Golden State Warriors will 
be without Steph Curry 
for at least the first series 
against the San Antonio 
Spurs, but the sheer talent 
of their team should help 
them coast by the Kawhi 
Leonard-less Spurs. The 
Warriors have been riddled 
with injuries this season, 
but with Kevin Durant, 
Klay Thompson, and 
Draymond Green playing 
their best basketball, this 
team shouldn’t have a 
problem to at least go to 
the Western Conference 
finals, especially when 
Curry returns to the lineup. 
But the real question is if 
they can win their third 
championship in four 
years. They can, but that 
doesn’t mean they will.
The Warriors’ biggest 
challenger in the West is the 
Houston Rockets, who set 
out last offseason to create 
their own Warriors-style 
super team, adding Chris 
Paul to team star James 
Harden. During the regular 
season, the Rockets were 
the best overall team in the 
league with a 65–17 record, 
boasting an NBA-leading 
offense and a defense that 
can’t be ignored. They have 
the talent and the ability to 
reach the finals, but they 
will have to go through the 
Warriors.
Among other teams 
in this very strong 
conference, the Oklahoma 
City Thunder’s offseason 
experiment  with adding 
Carmelo Anthony and Paul 
George to this  Russell 
Westbrook-led team (after 
Westbrook’s historic MVP 
season last year) has  led 
to mixed results, and has 
not met the pre-season 
expectations. The Thunder 
should make it past the first 
round against an exciting 
upstart Utah Jazz team on 
sheer talent alone, but they 
haven’t put it all together 
to make a run all the way to 
the finals.
The Tartan NBA Finals 
Prediction: Cavs-Warriors 
4.0; the Warriors win the 
championship in six games.

question is if 
[the Warriors] 
can win 
their third 
championship 
in four years. 
They can, but 
that doesn’t 
mean they 
will.”

On what to do during Carnival
Hey Izzy,
It’s my last Carnival, and I feel like I’ve 
experienced everything: from the Carnival Concert 
to Booth to Pavilion to getting drunk and waking 
up in someone else’s house. I almost debated just 
skipping Carnival this year and going away for the 
weekend.
But alas, my friends convinced me to stay saying, 
“it’s your last Carnival, you gotta experience it one 
more time.” But, I’m not really sure what other 
new, exciting things I can do. I guess I’ll go to all 
the usual things, like the Carnival Concert and 
Booth and Pavilion and I’ll probably end up getting 
too drunk and waking up in someone else’s house, 
but I’ll still have a whole weekend of stuff left to 
do. Do you have any ideas?
So Excited, NOT, Inneed Of Rest
Dear SENIOR,
In my opinion, your friends are right — it is your 
last Carnival and you should make the most of 
it. You’ll never see anything like Carnival at any 
other college, or really anywhere else for that 
matter — it’s not only a great break from the 
hustle and bustle of the intense stress of the last 
few weeks before school ends, but just a greatly 
timed surprise and a great way to spend time with 
friends or reconnect with people you haven’t seen.
See what your friends are doing, if anything. 
While some of the events are the same, what is 
always different are the new memories you make 
with friends along the way (cheesy, I know. Sorry). 
Wander around a bit and talk to people! Since 
Carnival is a break within the school year, it’s a 
great chance to surround yourself with friends and 
good vibes, and just have fun because school can 
be the worst sometimes.
And while some of the events are the same, that 
doesn’t mean what they offer every year is the 
same too. 
The Carnival Concert always has different artists, 
so maybe that difference in genre will pan out. 
Instead of the EDM music they usually have for 
almost every concert, this year, Activities Board is 
bringing rapper Wale out to The Cut.
Scotch’n’Soda will still be putting on a tale of 
questionable morality, but this time it is set in 
1920s Chicago rather than a high school in the 
1980s.
And instead of having their outdoor comedy show 
or whatever Activities Board (AB) did in previous 
years, AB is bringing Chris Gethard to Carnegie 
Mellon this Carnival! There’s a bunch of events 
listed in our Carnival calendar, so check it out.
But, more importantly, Carnival is a time to relax. 
If you end up just doing that, that’s also fine. You 
can choose to not do work, but also knock out 
some big projects out of the way. In the end, it’s 
really your time and experience, and what matters 
is that you make the most of it.
Love,
Izzy
India Price | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Hofbräuhaus
You may have noticed that your trusty Bar Buddy, 
Jade Crockem, didn’t write this week! But, don’t 
be fooled, she didn’t stop going to bars. This 
week, Jade and I took a group of friends to 
a trusted favorite — Hofbräuhaus Pittsburgh. 
Hofbräuhaus is a German brewery and restaurant, 
and, on one glorious night (Thursday) from 9 p.m. 
to 11 p.m., it’s College Night.
The location: Located in Southside Works, 
Hofbräuhaus is a great location for a group that 
wants the fun and excitement of spending a night 
out at the bar, without the hectic environment 
that ensues among the hustle and bustle of East 
Carson. It’s also a nice change from Shadyside, 
Squirrel Hill, and Oakland, so you get to see some 
new faces for a change. You can catch a 61 or 54 
bus, but it’ll take you about 30 minutes. But I can 
confirm that an Uber was less than $10, which is a 
nice price to pay for a change of scenery.
The drinks: Though you can order any classic 
cocktail at the bar, Hofbräuhaus is, after all, a 
German brewery. They specialize in beer — really 
good beer — and I’d have to recommend it. As an 
added bonus on College Nights, a one-liter stein 
will only cost you $6, and the in-house beers are 
a nice switch from your Buds and Millers. And for 
those of you who may not want to commit to a liter 
of beer you’ve never tried (can’t relate), half-liter 
steins are only $3!
The vibe: The vibe is really unlike any other bar in 
Pittsburgh. You get the unique and personal feel 
of a brewery; your group can grab a table for the 
night and comfortably hang out with your friends 
while your server brings you drinks, as opposed 
to your run-of-the-mill bar where everyone 
crowds the bartender flailing their $20s, and you 
unfortunately get stuck behind that one really tall 
guy who orders 10 drinks at a time (you know who 
you are). 
The music is also great. They play a successful 
mix of popular dance favorites and group classics 
that everyone knows all the words to, with a few 
German drinking songs mixed in. Admittedly, the 
place gets packed around 10 p.m., but you never 
feel cramped like you would at a club. Let’s get 
to the real reason why college students flock to 
Hofbräuhaus on a Thursday night: they encourage 
you to stand on the tables! Steins in hand, 
everyone climbs up onto their seats, singing and 
dancing with their friends. Just try not to be that 
guy who trips off the table.
Lit or nah: Hofbräuhaus gets a 100 percent on the 
Lit test. The music is great, the beer is great (and 
cheap!), and the location is a nice a change. On 
top of that, you truly get an experience that you 
don’t have anywhere else in Pittsburgh. That being 
said, if you’re just going out for a few yummy 
cocktails with your friends and aren’t anticipating 
anything too crazy, this might be a pass. Like I 
said before, you’re encouraged to climb onto your 
table and get a little rowdy, and that’s not always 
for everyone. But, if you’re looking for a unique 
place with the advantages of a small brewery 
coupled with all of the added excitement of a bar 
or club, Hofbräuhaus Pittsburgh’s College Night is 
the place for you.
For standing on tables and good beer 

---------------------------------------------------

This past Friday was my third time attending Carnegie Mellon’s K-Pop Dance Club’s (KPDC) showcase. I think it’s safe to say 
that after attending a few of these events, I’ve now become somewhat more of a K-Pop fan. Before this semester’s showcase, 
titled Dream High, I was most looking forward to being exposed to new K-pop songs (and adding those new songs to my 
K-pop Spotify playlist). I was also excited about seeing all the group outfits, dances, and just learning a bit more about the 
whole K-pop culture. This year’s showcase definitely delivered all those things, and in some ways, exceeded my expectations.
My friend and I arrived at Rangos Hall in the Cohon Center about ten minutes early, and even then we noticed that there 
weren’t that many people seated in the audience. It was surprising because at previous events, the whole room was packed 
with people. I guess this was a good thing for me and my friend at the time, since it made it really easy for us to find good 
seats. However, as it got to the last minute before showtime, all of a sudden so many people started coming into Rangos. It 
really was fascinating to see everyone so excited to support their friends performing, and to also dance along to their favorite 
K-pop songs.
What was noticeably different about this semester’s showcase was that they were selling glow sticks for the audience members 
to wave around during the performances. The colors of the glowsticks represented the different dance performances, and I 
found that to be a clever way of showing support for the various dance groups. Having some of the audience wave around 
their glow sticks throughout the night surely added to the fun and upbeat atmosphere of the event.

This year, I was especially impressed by all the dancers and 
performances. Having several friends who are members of KPDC, I 
was told that people from all levels of dance experience work equal-
ly hard to put on a successful showcase at the end of each semester. 
For me, it was pretty hard to distinguish the more experienced danc-
ers from the less experienced ones. One of my favorite performanc-
es was the opening performance with Blackpink’s “BOOMBAYAH,” 
which had a lot of upbeat vibes and hairflips. Other favorites of 
mine were the smooth dance with GOT7’s “Teenager” and the bub-
bly dance for iKON’s “LOVE SCENARIO.” The final performances 
of Taemin’s “MOVE” and BTS’s “Go Go” were two great dances 
to end the show. They also happened to be the dances that KPDC 
will perform at this semester’s Dancers’ Symposium. I won’t say 
too much about those dances (you’ll just have to see for yourself 
at Dancers’ Symposium), but what I loved most about them was 
how different the choreography was for both songs, yet they still fit 
perfectly together.
Something I realized after my third time attending the KPDC show-
case, that I had never realized before, was how easily K-pop can 
bring people together. KPDC has so many members on campus 
and off, and it amazes me how their love for the music genre, the 
dances, and the overall culture is what drives them to work together 
to create a successful showcase like Dream High. So many people 
participated and attended the showcase to support their friends and 
be in a comfortable space where they could express themselves 
and share their love for K-Pop. There was one part of the showcase 
where Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella group Joyful Noise performed 
a musical tribute to Jonghyun, a member of the popular K-pop band 
SHINee who died by suicide last December. Before their perfor-
mance, KPDC’s president, Alina Yu, spoke to the audience to raise 
awareness about mental health. Such a topic of discussion is very 
relevant today, as it affects individuals all over the world in vari-
ous ways. She reminded everyone to support and be there for one 
another, and it was clear that everyone in the audience took her 
words to heart. I didn’t think I’d learn so much from my experience 
at this year’s KPDC showcase. I will definitely be attending their 
future events, and I encourage you to do the same. You never know, 
you might learn something new and surprise yourself.

“Everyone deserves a great love story,” declared 
20th Century Fox when promoting the movie. 
And, a great love story is definitely what you get. 
But, Love, Simon is so much more than a cute 
high school romance. It is also a powerful story 
about identity, growth, and pushing back against 
societal expectations. Though unfortunate that it 
has taken so long, it seems appropriate then that 
Love, Simon broke the Hollywood mold by becom-
ing the first romance with a gay protagonist to be 
produced by a major film studio.
Whoopi Goldberg once said that “normal is noth-
ing more than a cycle on a washing machine.” 
Normal therefore should not be an adjective for 
people. Society should not have standards for oth-
ers’ identities. And, in the new romantic comedy 
Love, Simon, this issue of social normalcy is of 
utmost importance. Simon wants to know, “Why is 
straight the default?”
Adapted from young adult novel Simon vs. the 
Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli, Love, 
Simon follows Simon Spier, a high schooler in 
Atlanta who has a secret: he’s gay. The only one 
who knows is his online pen pal, Blue, another 
closeted gay teen at his school. After exchang-
ing many emails (under the pseudonym Jacques), 
Simon begins to fall in love with his mystery 
classmate. However, as he begins to get closer to 
Blue and tries to determine his identity, Simon’s 
life quickly grows more and more complicated.
After Simon accidentally forgets to log out of his 
email, his classmate Martin discovers his secret 
and threatens to expose Simon to the whole 
school unless he helps him to get the attention of 
one of Simon’s best friends, Abby. Unfortunately 
for Simon, his efforts to help his blackmailer are 
futile and chaos ensues as Martin vengefully outs 
him online.
Inspired in some ways by John Hughes’ films, 
director Greg Berlanti had large shoes to fill, 
but he does not disappoint. (And if you know 
me, you’ll know I am a huge John Hughes fan.) 
The film has its own unique story and charm, 
but it also shares characteristics of some of the 
most iconic teen flicks of the 1980s. Love, Simon 
deserves to be acknowledged in contemporary 
film canon.
With a fantastic cast, including Nick Robinson, 
Katherine Langford, Jennifer Garner, and Josh 
Duhamel, the story truly came to life. Each cast 
member was perfect for their respective roles 
and the relationship Simon had with each of 
the characters truly felt human and authentic. In 
particular, Simon’s relationship with his parents 
was unique and raw. Unlike most fictional worlds 
following teen characters, Simon actually had a 
strong relationship with his family and continued 
to maintain that relationship throughout the film. 
Oftentimes family is removed or is a negative 
source of energy in teen characters’ lives, but this 
was refreshingly not the case in Love, Simon.
As a book addict with high standards for movie 
adaptations, I was pleasantly surprised by how 
everything translated to screen. I was espe-
cially nervous how they would handle the email 
exchanges, but they presented it in an exciting 
way, juxtaposing Simon’s messages with vignettes 
of Blue’s life based on Simon’s imagination as he 
struggles to solve the mystery. Most adaptations 
have to cut beloved scenes and details when pre-
sented in film, but Love, Simon remained true to its 
roots and gave the fans what they wanted, oreo 
obsession and all.
Love, Simon is a must-see film. It made me cry, it 
made me laugh, and it definitely made me flail 
in excitement like the fangirl I am. It authentically 
captures the teen experience, from the highest 
highs to the lowest lows, and perfectly balances 
humor, fun, and an adorable romance with critical 
topics about identity and acceptance.

Editors Review Ready Player One
written by Michelle Madlansacay | Pillbox Editor
art by Rebecca Enright | Staff Artist
When I first saw the trailer for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, I honestly was a bit intimidated. There seemed to be so much going on in the 
movie, and I didn’t think I’d be able to handle all the chaos that had appeared on my small YouTube screen. However, one thing led to another and 
somehow, I ended up watching the film on a giant movie screen at The Waterfront.
I’ll just be very upfront and say that I found the movie to be just okay. This certainly wasn’t the reaction I expected to have before watching the 
movie; at least I was able to handle all the virtual world chaos. The graphics were all great and the overall concept of the movie was interesting, 
but the story was simply alright. I just think there were too many cliches in the movie. I felt as though I had already seen or heard a story like this 
before. Of course, the setting of the virtual world of the Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation (OASIS) was unique and that 
was surely one of the more fascinating aspects of the film for me. Also the theme of technology and its interference with our interactions and percep-
tions of reality was very relevant and intriguing. However, the story itself was somewhat predictable, and I found many of the intentionally humorous 
punchlines to be a little cringe-worthy. I thought of Ready Player One as an odd take on an action-adventure children’s movie, with curse words you 
could only find in R-rated films scattered throughout.
Aside from the cliched storyline, I thought the acting in the 
movie was pretty good. Tye Sheridan, who portrayed the 
main character Wade Watts, was a very brave and con-
vincing hero in the film. I was also very impressed by Lena 
Waithe and Olivia Cook’s performances as Helen/Aech 
and Samantha Cook/Art3mis (respectively), who were very 
strong and badass female characters in the film. Something 
that I definitely appreciated about the film was the diversity 
of the entire main cast. The actors and actresses repre-
sented various ethnic and racial backgrounds, from African-
American actress Lena Waithe to Japanese actor and singer 
Win Morisaki who portrayed Toshiro/Daito in the film.
It truly was nice seeing the cultural inclusion and timely social 
topics presented in the film. I felt that the movie could have 
been much better if it built more on its strengths, especially 
in regards to themes of reality and technology. The scenes 
that really focused in on the topic seemed a bit rushed, and 
I wish they could have done more with that. I also felt like 
other parts of the storyline were a bit underdeveloped in the 
film, especially the romance between Wade and Samantha. 
Hopefully, the things that I felt were not covered as thorough-
ly in the film were covered in Ernest Cline’s novel. I guess I’ll 
have to read the book to find out.

---------------------------------------------------

Last week, a friend dragged me to a movie 
that she described as a “love story between 
a mute woman and a fish.” I was intrigued 
and had no idea what to expect. The Shape 
of Water turned out to be marvelous, an adult 
fairy tale swimming in truths about racism, 
homophobia, and the fear of the unknown.
The setting is Baltimore, Maryland. The time 
is the early ‘60s: America is in the grip of the 
Civil Rights movement and at the height of 
the Cold War. While Washington is obsessed 
with finding new ways to stay a step ahead 
of the Soviets, many Americans view the “oth-
ers” — those with different skin tones, sexual 
dispositions, or ideologies — with contempt.
Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute, isolated 
and idealistic cleaning lady in a hidden, 
high-security government lab in Baltimore. 
She values routine and seems content with 
her stock in life. Every day, she wakes up 
in the evening, makes her hard-boiled egg, 
checks in with her roommate Giles (Richard 
Jenkins), a repressed gay 
unemployed artist, takes the bus to work, 
and arrives just in time for her chatty and 
protective friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) 
to punch her in. All of this is upended 
when the “fish” is brought into the lab by 
cruel government agent Richard Strickland 
(Michael Shannon). The credits bill him as 
the “Amphibian Man.” He is a blue-skinned, 
humanoid amphibian kidnapped by Strickland 
from the Amazon, where the natives consider 
him a god.
Strickland and most of the facility view the 
Amphibian Man as a test subject to be wea-
ponized. They want to study and dissect him, 
looking for secrets that might counter the 
Russians. Strickland, in particular, treats him 
with contempt and hatred, routinely torturing 
him to show dominance. Opposing Strickland 
is Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), a 
scientist with a secret agenda, who wants the 
creature studied in a more humane way.
Elisa, on the other hand, becomes fascinated 
with the Amphibian Man, sneaking into his 
chamber, and introducing him to things from 
her life — hard boiled egg and recorded 
music. Neither of them can speak to any-
one, and this shared experience lets 
them read each other on a more 
primal level. They develop an 
instant wordless bond. With time, their bond 
blossoms into love, leading to an inter-species 
romance that is beautiful, because it is narra-
tively challenging. It flies in the face of social, 
even moral acceptability, and is set in a time 
when interracial and same-sex relationships 
were viewed in the same way.
Save for a surrealistic dream sequence late 
in the movie, neither Elisa nor the Amphibian 
Man utter a single word. And yet, stolen 
glances, intimate body language, and the 
characters’ actions reveal their deep long-
ing to each other and to us. Sally Hawkins 
has done a truly incredible job with Elisa, 
spectacularly conveying her growth through 
the movie. She goes from being despondently 
content with her humdrum existence to facing 
down everything that is expected of her with 
a burning passion. She sneaks the Amphibian 
Man out of the lab in a daring escape and 
uses sign language to tell a clueless Strickland 
to f*** off in a poignant display of defiance. 
Hawkins has succeeded creating a multi-dimen-
sional character with strength and vulnerability 
— without a line of dialogue.
Another way to look at The Shape of Water

green, blue and scaly, sounds like an alien, 
and towers above the human characters. He

When you search for the meaning of the word 
“adaptation,” you find several different mean-
ings on Google. There’s the obvious, which 
defines the word as “the action or process of 
adapting or being adapted.” For the purposes 
of Steven Spielberg’s latest blockbuster Ready 
Player One, an “adaptation” is defined as “a 
movie, television drama, or stage play that has 
been adapted from a written work, typically a 
novel.”
As a blockbuster movie, I was a bit surprised 
by how much fun I had. As an adaptation, 
Ready Player One is incredibly poor and 
disappointing.
Ernest Cline’s 2011 hit novel Ready Player One 
was a book I knew I’d always love, even when 
I first read it last March. I loved its expansive 
world and Cline’s natural construction of char-
acter progression, rewarding readers with 
a big emotional payoff during its final act. I 
loved its many, many eighties references, and 
it only made me want to explore more into the 
decade. I loved how the novel instantly pulled 
you in to the Ontologically Anthropocentric 
Sensory Immersive Simulation (OASIS) and 
the world of protagonist Wade Watts. I found 
it surprisingly easy to get through 200 pages 
in a sitting. And, I loved how even though the 
book pulled you in to the OASIS, the novel was 
still very much tied to reality, balancing time 
between the virtual reality world and Wade’s 
dystopian Columbus, OH. There were a few 
problems, and a few of Ready Player One’s 
main storylines don’t stand strongly against the 
test of time, but it’s still a solid novel.
And, in a broader sense, I did enjoy the movie 
and I had a lot of fun. You can easily get 
sucked into Spielberg’s mindless (but a little bit 
lazy) adaptation. It has an almost video-game 
like feel in 
how the characters, storyline, and visuals drag 
you in. The big landmark scenes of the movie, 
like the final fight and the (albeit unnecessary) 
various car chases, are entertaining and fill you 
with a surprising amount of heart and energy. 
If you had read the book, it’s still interesting to 
see how Spielberg handled the admittedly hard 
task of adapting Cline’s beloved novel to the 
big screen.
But there are some moments where I feel like 
the screenwriters assumed the audience of this 
film would have read the book before going 
to see the movie, as if they knew Cline’s novel 
was a massive hit and assumed it was like 
Harry Potter, where everyone and their mother 
would have read it. In fact, I feel like I would 
have struggled with this movie had I not read 
the book first, which feels a bit disheartening 
and making the movie — as an adaptation — 
even more disappointing. There are some refer-
ences in the movie from the novel that weren’t 
explained very well, such as the “High Five,” 
which refers to the five main protagonists’ 
avatars — Parzival, Art3mis, Aech, Daito, and 
Sho, the top five ranked players in a contest for 
control of the entirety of the OASIS, established 
by OASIS creator himself James Halliday after 
his death.
Additionally, there doesn’t feel like there’s a 
lot of payoff or stakes in this movie. Instead of 
showing protagonist Wade Watts’ rags-to-riches 
rise from the very start of the contest, like in 
the novel, the movie glosses over this detail 
and starts the story from close to the end of the 
discovery of the first gate. Watts is supposed 
to be this expert on all things Halliday and 80s 
pop culture, but you don’t really get a strong 
sense of that throughout the entire movie. 
While the novel still integrated much of reality 
and real-world stakes despite focusing a lot 
on the OASIS, most of the movie takes place 
inside the VR game and its translation of real-
world stakes is infantilized to small issues like 
losing all your OASIS avatar’s stuff and 
money. It’s almost a little bit demean-
ing. In fact, this movie feels like 
it trades that payoff for a 
larger heavy-handed focus on 
overall social issues, which 
were underlined discreetly 
throughout the novel and 
executed a bit haphazardly 
in Ready Player One. In the 
movie, it feels like the entire contest is shaped 
around it, taking away a bit of the fun from the 
adaptation.
However, the movie’s worst crime is that the 
adaptation took out a lot of the things that 
made the novel great. Details from the novel 
are switched around to benefit the story, and 
just simply don’t make sense when compar-
ing it to the base product. The movie couldn’t 
find a unique balance between being fun and 
trying to tell a larger story, with more weight 
on being an entertaining movie than having a 
cohesive plot. This movie, as a matter of fact, 
wasn’t very unique at all. I don’t blame this 
entirely on Spielberg, but rather the movie’s 
writers Zak Penn and, yes, Ernest Cline, for 
taking something unique — Cline’s own unique 
creation — and making it a typical flashy sci-fi 
hit trying to kick off the summer movie season 
early in the middle of March before Avengers: 
Infinity War does the same thing a month later.
There’s one definition of “adaptation” that 
stuck with me when I was writing this review. 
In biological terms, Google defines “adapta-
tion” as “a change or the process of change 
by which an organism or species becomes 
better suited to its environment.” I knew that 
Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One would 
be an inferior adaptation of the novel and that 
adapting the movie would be a difficult task, 
but I didn’t expect to be so torn and, ultimately, 
disappointed.
According to the Los Angeles Times, most of 
the movie’s changes were to eliminate scenes 
that would be uninteresting on the screen, such 
as when Wade accomplishes a perfect score 
in Pac-Man, or when Wade recites all the lines 
from the film WarGames. This detail sums up 
the movie pretty well. Rather than telling a 
unique story about one nerd’s rise and fall and 
second rise to glory, the adaptation of Ready 
Player One focused more on making the story 
fit in general to the screen rather than telling 
the story in general. It focuses more on making 
the film exciting rather than engaging. Rather 
than conveying how we should spend more 
time with human company rather than on a 
screen, Ready Player One is a perfect example 
of how Hollywood treats mainstream adapta-
tions: as a tertiary priority over overt visual 
decadence and audience simplicity, resulting in 
just another action movie.
A fun movie but a poor adaptation.Editors Review Ready Player One

THE FRANK OCEAN ALBUM YOU HAVEN’T HEARD
In August 2016, after years of total silence, Frank Ocean inally reemerged with new music. It started 
with a mysterious livestream of a mostly empty warehouse, watermarked with an Apple Music logo in 
the bottom corner of the video. What followed was two and half weeks of mundane construction, as 
Frank himself cut wood and spray-painted boxes with little context and no explanation. At one point, 
he completely disappeared from the stream, until he suddenly returned to the shock of eager fans 
who had been watching a loop of an empty room for days on end. Upon his return, it became clear 
that Frank was building a staircase, and after a few more hours of assembly the video was accompa-
nied by new music. Frank completed the staircase, walked to the top as the music swelled, and the 
stream cut out. Fans went into a frenzy, begging for a new album and were frustrated after watching 
what was essentially an extended black-and-white construction tutorial. Their pleas for new music 
came inally just a few minutes later, as Frank’s sophomore album Endless was released in the form 
of a 45-minute edited video of the construction that took place during the livestream. However, after 
only a few hours after releasing Endless, an Apple Music representative informed the music press 
that Frank would have something more to share in a few days. That something more was Blonde, 
Frank’s seminal 2016 album that persists in its relevance in music culture almost two years later.
But as Blonde rose to prominence, and Endless was never released in proper album format, the latter 
faded into obscurity aside from a handful of dedicated fans who made bootleg album iles ripped 
directly from the video. Fans lauded over Endless CDQ, an almost mythical original version of the 
album that wasn’t washed out like the version played in the original video (CDQ stands for “compact 
disk quality”).
Then, a New York Times proile of Frank revealed how his Def Jam contract had interfered with his 
work for years, and thus explained why the artist had been absent for so long. In that proile, Frank 
shared how he got out of his Def Jam contract: he was obligated to release one more album under 
his contract, but wanted to release his next true album independently. So, he made two albums: 
Endless, the visual album, which fulilled his contract obligations to Def Jam but would never be a full 
traditional album release, and Blonde, which was released independently two days after he fulilled 
his contract. The wait for new Frank Ocean music was, in large part, caused by an extended game of 
contractual chess that culminated in a double album release after four years of silence.
Frank also revealed in the proile that he bought the rights to all his original masters for his music 
back from Def Jam after going independent, and thus held the rights to later release Endless on his 
own terms. Hardcore fans hoped that this meant a re-release was imminent, but in true Frank Ocean 
fashion, they heard nothing for over a year. And then, in November 2017, seemingly out of nowhere, 
Frank listed CD, DVD, VHS and vinyl copies of Endless ---- along with some new posters ----- on his 
website for sale.

---------------------------------------------------

Fans rushed to purchase copies, and found that product listings said that the physical 
releases would ship in 6 to 8 weeks. Of course, 8 weeks came and went, and no news 
was shared over the status of their orders, despite having already been charged. And 
then, after even more months of waiting, customers received physical copies of Endless 
for the irst time last week. Kipped versions of the CD were uploaded online and the End-
less CDQ was inally realized, a year and half after its original release. Debates over 
the oficial tracklist were inally resolved, and fans got to hear the album in its intended 
crisp, fully mastered format.
The album itself is nothing short of magniicent. Some fans of Frank’s debut album,   
Channel Orange, were disappointed by Blonde’s experimental sound. Endless is even 
more experimental and indulgent, bordering on ambient in nature. Tracks like “UNI-
TR” and “Slide on Me,” though, bring the distinctly “Frank catchy” originality that has 
brought him such acclaim. “Kushes” and “Higgs” are some of the more impressive vocal 
showcases in Frank’s discography, while album-closer, “Mitsubishi Sony,” features an 
extended instrumental outro that is as lavish as it is industrial. The album shines lyrically, 
too, as Frank’s poetic lyrics are made stronger and more impactful by his otherworldly 
range and performance.
The story of Endless is a microcosm of Frank’s story itself. Its existence and release were 
mythicized for years, and its absence from streaming platforms would drive most fans 
to lose interest. ;ut upon its long-awaited release, every agonizing second of waiting 
was proven to be worth it. Endless is fantastic, and should be a nice treat for listeners of 
Blonde who have never heard the perpetually absent album.

This weekend, The Frame Gallery featured The Butt End, a collection of paintings by sophomore 
art major Mairead Dambruch. Referring to “the last slice of bread in a loaf,” Dambruch’s eight 
works aim to examine things overlooked or regarded as having zero to no value. Dambruch 
shows this through small and darkly endearing minute details in her oil paintings, showcasing 
the breakdown of the images and social constructions of gender, human intimacy, and the typical 
American lifestyle. A reception was held on Friday, April 13, from 6-9 p.m. and the exhibit was 
also on display during the weekend.
