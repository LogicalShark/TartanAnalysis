CUC expands among other campus construction
Mory appointed Vice President of University Advancement
LAURA SCHERB
Publisher
On Tuesday, July 28, the 
university announced that 
Scott Mory will start on as the 
vice president for university 
advancement on Oct. 1 of this 
year. Mory will replace Pam 
Eager, who has been serving 
as the head of the develop-
ment team in the interim.
Cheri Hays, the director 
of the of?ce of the president, 
and Michael Murphy, vice 
president for campus affairs, 
led a national search for a 
candidate to ?ll the position 
over the last year.
Mory, who currently 
serves as associate senior vice 
president and director of the 
University of Southern Cali-
fornia’s (USC) campaign, will 
take the helm on initiatives 
such as alumni engagement 
and fundraising campaigns 
in order to provide a more 
stable ?nancial future for the 
university. 
During his time at USC, 
Mory helped build the cam-
paign infrastructure that 
coordinated activity among 
USC’s 20 schools and 450 
development staff. Working 
closely with top-level univer-
sity administrators, Mory was 
at the helm of a campaign 
that recently passed the $4.4 
billion mark, making it one of 
the largest higher education 
campaigns in history.
Before he worked at USC, 
Mory served as assistant vice 
president for alumni rela-
tions and annual giving at 
George Washington Univer-
sity, where he earned his B.A. 
and J.D. Mory has experience 
both in the ?eld of law and 
as an associate professor at 
George Washington Univer-
sity’s School of Law, where he 
taught a ?rst-year course on 
legal research, writing, and 
oral advocacy.
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity President Subra Suresh 
sent out an email in July an-
nouncing the appointment, 
saying that “Scott’s leader-
ship, strong track record and 
passion will provide an im-
portant contribution to rais-
ing our advancement efforts 
to a new level.”
Suresh also wrote that 
Mory would play a key part 
in building the ?nancial base 
that will allow the university 
to advance its strategic plan 
over the next few years as he 
provides the groundwork for 
support that faculty and stu-
dents need in their work. 
“This is a critical position 
for the university, as we seek 
to build our advancement 
team and build on recent 
successes. Scott’s leadership, 
strong track record and pas-
sion will help elevate our ad-
vancement efforts to a new 
level,” Suresh said in a univer-
sity press release.
At a time during which the 
university has received sev-
eral large philanthropic gifts 
from notable alumni, Mory’s 
position will hopefully serve 
to continue the trend, increas-
ing donations and engage-
ment among both current 
students and alumni of all 
ages. “CMU is well-positioned 
to realize the philanthropy 
that will fuel its future aspira-
tions, with its rich traditions, 
community of loyal alumni, 
parents and friends, extensive 
global reach and the leader-
ship of President Suresh. I am 
excited to get started,” Mory 
said in the press release.
“As one of the world’s 
great research universities, 
Carnegie Mellon must con-
tinually challenge itself to 
pursue greater aspirations,” 
said Jim Rohr, chairman of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Board of 
Trustees, in the press release. 
“Scott brings experience that 
will play an important role in 
helping the university support 
those ambitious plans.”

coming to Carnegie Mellon, will begin his term as Vice President of 
University Advancement on Oct. 1.

Editor-in-Chief
Returning students will 
?nd a few things different 
about Carnegie Mellon when 
classes begin next week, in 
the midst of the busiest period 
of university expansion since 
its founding in 1900. 
Last spring, the university 
began expanding the Jared 
L. Cohon University Center 
(CUC). The CUC, originally 
built in the mid-nineties and 
renamed after former univer-
sity president Jared L. Cohon 
in March 2014, is receiving 
expanded athletic facilities, a 
new studio theater space, and 
other changes that are still in 
the works.
The improved CUC will 
include a new gateway to 
Forbes Avenue, a “front door” 
for the university that re-
inforces Carnegie Mellon’s 
2012 master plan, according 
to Campus Design and Facil-
ity Development’s website. 
According to the website, 
“While complementary to the 
existing facility, the addition 
is designed to be a contem-
porary architectural piece, 
incorporating materials from 
the existing building palette.”
Although construction for 
the expansion of?cially broke 
ground in October, changes 
to the CUC began in earnest 
during the spring semester. 
In March, after the end of the 
Tartan swim team’s 2014–15 
season, the university closed 
the CUC’s locker rooms and 
half-sized Olympic swimming 
pool to begin renovations. The 
reopened facilities feature an 
improved locker room, two 
?tness classrooms, and a 
dedicated cycling studio. The 
pool’s air handling system will 
also be refurbished. Before 
the renovations, the CUC held 
only one ?tness classroom, 
restricting the schedule of 
group exercise and other ?t-
ness classes.
The new studio theater, 
according to the website, in-
cludes “dance quality ?oor-
ing” along with a lighting 
system, sound system, and 
tension grid. Student organi-
zations can use this space for 
dance and theater rehearsals 
and performances, as well as 
small concerts.
These changes come about 
as part of a larger effort to 
improve athletic facilities on 
campus. Although plans for 
the upcoming David A. Tep-
per Quadrangle are not yet 
?nalized, Tepper stipulated 
with his $67 million donation 
that the new space include 
athletic facilities. The univer-
sity is working with architec-
ture ?rm Moore Ruble Yudell 
Architects & Planners to de-
sign the new space, which will 
also include what will be the 
campus’s largest auditorium, 
a university welcome cen-
ter, a technology-enhanced 
learning space for the Eberly 
Center, and the of?cial home 
of the Tepper School of Busi-
ness and the Simon Initiative. 
Over the course of the next 
year, university administra-
tors will work with deans and 
CMU ECE student indicted as part of federal hacking bust
BRIAN WALSH 
News Editor
In mid-July, the U.S. De-
partment of Justice (DOJ) 
charged Carnegie Mellon ju-
nior electrical and computer 
engineering major and return-
ing FireEye intern Morgan 
Culbertson for developing and 
distributing malware. Culbert-
son allegedly actively distrib-
uted malware on Darkode, a 
renowned online black market 
for malicious code. Special-
izing in Android security ex-
ploits, Culbertson’s malware 
sought mainly to steal user 
data from mobile phones.
An investigation of Darkode 
by the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation led to the arrests 
of nearly 90 alleged cyber 
criminals, including Culbert-
son. Of?cials allege that Cul-
bertson, one of the youngest 
among those indicted at only 
20 years old, created a piece of 
Android malware called Den-
droid. Dendroid allowed buy-
ers of the software to remotely 
access Android phones.
Culbertson, who went to 
Shadyside’s Winchester Thur-
ston Upper School, began de-
veloping Dendroid when he 
was 17. The malware could be 
purchased through Darkode 
from Culbertson — under the 
alias “Android” — for the Bit-
coin equivalent of about $300, 
according to the Pittsburgh 
City Paper. Culbertson’s father, 
Robert Culbertson, is a retired 
Carnegie Mellon professor of 
entrepreneurship and founder 
of several successful start-up 
companies.
Culbertson is not the ?rst 
notable hacker to come out of 
Carnegie Mellon. George Hotz, 
for example — more common-
ly known as GeoHotz — was 
well known for creating the 
?rst iPhone jailbreak, allowing 
users to use the phone with 
providers other than AT&T 
and install their own software. 
Hotz also gained recognition 
for his exploits with the ?rm-
ware of Sony’s Playstation 3, 
which culminated in a lawsuit 
from Sony.
Computer science students 
at Carnegie Mellon know the 
word hack — or hacker — very 
well. A hacker is not neces-
sarily malicious, and in some 
situations even does good. 
Hackathons, for example, have 
co-opted the work “hack” as 
a term for putting together a 
good solution quickly, with 
minimal resources. Hack-
athons are bene?cial competi-
tions that help students learn. 
For Build18, an annual hack-
athon held at Carnegie Mellon 
in the spring, hackers meet in 
the Jared L. Cohon University 
Center’s Wiegand Gymnasium. 
Tartanhacks, another annual 
hackathon at Carnegie Mellon, 
is put together by the student 
organization ScottyLabs. 
Carnegie Mellon’s fac-
ulty generally trains students 
against hacking maliciously. In 
15-213: Introduction to Com-
puter Systems, for example, 
a core computer science class 
that provides “a programmer’s 
view of how computer systems 
execute programs, store infor-
mation, and communicate,” 
professors stress that the cur-
riculum is meant to teach stu-
dents how to produce safer 
code, not exploit poorly writ-
ten code.
Working for the cyberse-
curity company FireEye for 
the second summer in a row, 
Culbertson was supposed to 
be practicing that philosophy, 
but it became clear that he was 
using techniques learned from 
the company to develop his 
malware.
“Mr. Culbertson’s intern-
ship has been suspended 
pending an internal review 
of his activities. As there are 
ongoing investigations by ex-
ternal parties and FireEye, we 
cannot provide any further 
comment on Mr. Culbertson 
and his activities,” FireEye 
spokesperson Kyrk Storer said 
in a press release.

Suspicious Person 
August 7, 2015
University Police were 
dispatched to the university 
bookstore after receiving a 
report of a suspicious person. 
The person was described as 
a black male around 40 years 
old and 5 feet 10 inches tall, 
with a beard, wearing a grey 
T-shirt and white shorts. Uni-
versity bookstore staff said 
that the man was carrying 
textbooks under each arm, 
and told the staff that he was 
trying to replace his sister’s 
damaged textbook, but did 
not remember the name. After 
being told that the textbooks 
were not yet for sale, the man 
put them back and left the 
store.

Carnegie Mellon’s Urban 
Design Regional Employ-
ment Action for Minorities 
(UDream) has recently re-
ceived national recognition. 
UDream is an 18-week in-
tensive program offered over 
the summer and in the fall at 
Carnegie Mellon. The pro-
gram gives minority students 
a hands-on taste of urban de-
sign, with the goal of keeping 
them in Pittsburgh.
UDream was recognized 
twice this year by the Ameri-
can Institute of Architects 
(AIA). 
At the organization’s 2015 
Grassroots Leadership and 
and Legislative conference 
in Washington, D.C., the AIA 
recognized UDream for its in-
novative method of diversify-
ing Pittsburgh’s urban design 
industry. The AIA also recog-
nized UDream as a Diversity 
Recognition Program at the 
AIA National Conference in 
Atlanta.
Many UDream alumni 
have stayed in Pittsburgh to 
implement new concepts for 
neighborhoods, work with 
local architecture ?rms, and 
participate in the local chap-
ter of the National Organiza-
tion of Minority Architects 
(NOMA). The local chapter 
of NOMA is an example of 
UDream’s impact on the city 
— before the program began, 
Pittsburgh had lost its NOMA 
chapter because the city had 
so few minority architects.
Ashley Cox participated 
in UDream after graduating 
from Howard University with 
an undergraduate degree in 
architecture. When Cox ar-
rived at UDream, she and a 
team of other students were 
charged with planning a resi-
dential corridor in the Hill 
District.
“It’s thinking about what 
makes a community a com-
munity,” Cox said in a uni-
versity press release “How 
do you develop a new thing 
that resonates with what was 
there?”
The program also in-
cludes a 12-week internship, 
which allows students to gain 
valuable real-world experi-
ence as architects and urban 
planners.
CMU’s UDream receives national recognition
CIT conducts national survey on device trust
Carnegie Mellon’s Col-
lege of Engineering recently 
conducted a survey of over 
2,000 U.S. consumers. The 
survey asked participants 
to rank the 10 electronic 
devices that they trust the 
most with their personal 
information.
Consumers are generally 
more likely to trust items in 
the home. At the top of the 
list were items like home 
phone and home security 
system, while items like cell 
phones, laptops, desktop 
computers, and tablets were 
at the bottom.
Results also differed by 
factors such as gender and 
age. Men are more likely to 
trust electronics in their car 
than women are, and young 
adults (18–24 years old) 
are more likely to trust their 
smartphones, compared to 
older users.
Ken Mai, a systems sci-
entist in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department, is 
working to create low-cost, 
hardware-level methods of 
securing electronics against 
malicious attacks.
“When users think about 
the security of their electron-
ics, most are concerned with 
their software and the Inter-
net,” Mai said in a university 
press release. “But it’s criti-
cal that users consider the 
security of their hardware, 
too. Security vulnerabilities 
in hardware can be just as 
dangerous (if not more so) 
as software breaches, and 
are usually much harder to 
?x.”

The Republican Party held 
its ?rst major debate of the 
2016 primary races on Au-
gust 6 in Cleveland, Ohio. 
Co-sponsored by Fox News 
and Facebook, the debates 
featured the top-ten highest 
polling candidates of the race: 
Donald Trump, reality-TV 
star and billionaire; Ben Car-
son, neurosurgeon; Jeb Bush, 
ex-Florida governor; Scott 
Walker, governor of Wiscon-
sin; Mike Huckabee, governor 
of Arkansas; Ted Cruz, Texas 
junior state senator; Marco 
Rubio, Florida junior state 
senator; Rand Paul, Kentucky 
senator; Chris Christie, gover-
nor of New Jersey; and John 
Kasich, governor of Ohio. The 
debates were moderated by 
Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and 
Chris Wallace, and watched 
by nearly 24 million Ameri-
can voters. The debates fea-
tured questions asked by the 
moderators and, additionally, 
questioned asked by viewers 
on Facebook, both through 
video submissions and text 
comments.
The candidates wrestled 
with each other and the mod-
erators over issues of abor-
tion, border control, political 
experience, international re-
lations, and welfare. The next 
debate will take place on Sept. 
16, and will be sponsored by 
CNN.

The drought in California 
has continued over the summer 
and is now well into its fourth 
year with no sign of letting up. 
While the state operates under 
water restrictions, wildlife is 
withering away, crops that sup-
ply the entire country with food 
are drying up, and wild?res are 
burning in the Sierra Nevada. 
Recently released research has 
shown that scientists believe 
that the drought has been fur-
thered and intensi?ed by the 
rising temperatures that are a 
consequence of climate change. 
They say that the next two years 
could be the most brutal in Cali-
fornia’s recent history, and that 
up to 2,000 rural wells have 
dried up in the meantime.

department heads to real-
locate classroom space with 
these expansions in mind.
The Tepper Quadrangle, 
although it will not be com-
pleted until fall 2018, also 
has more immediate impli-
cations for campus life. The 
Quad, planned to be 295,000 
square feet spread across four-
and-a-half acres of university 
property, will displace Spring 
Carnival, which until this year 
took place on the Morewood 
Gardens parking lot.
This year’s Spring Carnival 
will be the ?rst to be spread 
across the College of Fine Arts 
lawn and parking lot. Booths 
will be on the parking lot, 
while Carnival rides and at-
tractions will be on the lawn. 
Members of the university’s 
administration proposed the 
CFA lawn and parking lot af-
ter looking at several other 
options and narrowing down 
the list through extensive re-
search, meetings with student 
organizations such as AB Con-
certs and Student Senate, and 
town hall meetings to garner 
the opinion of the student 
body.
The university also an-
nounced in June that it would 
be “moving toward a uni?ed 
campus” by “undertak[ing] 
a project to connect the por-
tions of campus north and 
south of Forbes Avenue, while 
completing a uni?ed vision 
for the Cut.” According to a 
campus-wide email from Vice 
President for Campus Affairs 
Michael Murphy and Vice 
President for Finance and 
Chief Financial Of?cer Amir 
Rahnamay-Azar, this project 
will expand the Purnell Center 
for the Arts to the north, to-
ward Forbes Avenue.
“The largest element will 
be a structure extending from 
the Purnell Center to the 
north,” the email says. “A part 
of the university’s master plan 
for more than a decade, this 
addition will visually match 
the Cohon University Center 
side of the Cut, providing a 
natural campus entry point 
and seamless connection to 
the new Tepper Quadrangle 
to the north. The structure 
will house a faculty gathering 
space and of?ces that will free 
space elsewhere.”
The expansion will also in-
clude a “town square,” a space 
meant to provide a “safe and 
pleasant” crossing for Forbes 
Avenue and an “outdoor gath-
ering space linking the Cut to 
campus facilities to the north.” 
The university sought propos-
als from architecture ?rms 
over the summer to plan this 
addition.
The university is also plan-
ning to expand along the 
Forbes Avenue corridor to-
ward Craig Street. In a cam-
pus-wide email in April, Vice 
Provost for Research Farnam 
Jahanian outlined a plan for 
a plot of land on the south 
side of Forbes Avenue, near 
South Craig Street. This de-
velopment, located next to the 
Carnegie Museum of National 
History and the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Art, “could include 
research space for faculty and 
students, space for external 
partners, labs and studios for 
collaborative industry-aca-
demia use, of?ce space, a qual-
ity hotel, parking, and some 
retail space. It would build on 
the momentum of the adja-
cent Mehrabian Collaborative 
Innovation Center and serve 
as a new gateway to our cam-
pus from the west,” Jahanian 
wrote in the email.
This development is part of 
the university’s plan to create 
a new “innovation corridor” 
along Forbes Avenue, one that 
could “rival the major hubs of 
innovation around the world, 
and make Pittsburgh and 
Carnegie Mellon University a 
magnet for talent and an axis 
for ideas that have global im-
pact.”
Hamburg Hall is also in the 
midst of a renovation, and the 
university is continuing con-
struction on the Sherman and 
Joyce Bowie Scott Hall. Scott 
Hall, nestled between Ham-
erschlag and Wean Halls and 
scheduled to be completed 
in 2016, will be the home to 
Carnegie Mellon’s growing 
Biomedical Engineering De-
partment, nano fabrication, 
and the Wilton E. Scott Insti-
tute for Energy Innovation.
Scott Hall will “house wet and 
dry laboratories, collaborative 
and of?ce spaces, a cafe, and a 
10K SF cleanroom facility,” ac-
cording to Carnegie Mellon’s 
department of Campus Design 
and Facilities Management.
Currently the North side of 
Forbes Avenue, in front of the 
Morewood Gardens parking 
lot, is under heavy construc-
tion after a water main break 
in early June. The construc-
tion has reduced Forbes Av-
enue between Morewood Av-
enue and South Craig Street 
to one lane in either direction, 
hindering the ?ow of traf?c 
through Oakland.

Make connections with your professors
GORDON ESSTES
Staffwriter
“They won’t let you do that in 
college.”
Do what, exactly? Use a calcula-
tor? Bring notes? Ask for an exten-
sion? According to your teachers in 
high school, there are a whole lot of 
things that “they” won’t let you do. 
But the truth of the matter is simple: 
Now that you’re in the big leagues, 
there are few things that your pro-
fessors won’t let you do.
That doesn’t mean that you can 
come to class drunk, start swinging 
from the lights, and throw things at 
the TAs. What it does mean, though, 
is that you are now the only person 
in the world responsible for your 
own education. Your math profes-
sors probably won’t have a problem 
with calculators, but if you don’t 
actually know the material, that’s 
your own fault —  your problem, not 
theirs.
But professors do care. They 
want you to succeed. And, probably, 
so do you. The question is how.
Professors might not demand a 
lot, but they expect more than they 
let on. Let’s get the obvious out of 
the way: Come to class and do the 
work. Nobody’s taking attendance 
anymore, but if you miss lecture, 
you won’t be very happy when ?nals 
roll around.
Professors also want you to at 
least try to pay attention. Class can 
be boring sometimes — any high 
school graduate has learned this a 
dozen times over — but let’s face it: 
You’re no longer here by law. You’re 
here to learn, so at least try to inter-
face with the material. If you ?nd 
yourself drifting, ask yourself why. 
Are you feeling lost? Do some extra 
preparation.
Snacking in class is generally 
?ne. Most professors won’t care if 
you get up and go to the bathroom 
in the middle of a seminar. Want to 
use your laptop in a lecture? Prob-
ably okay. But if you ?nd yourself 
bringing a small army of electronics 
wherever you go, it might be good to 
ask yourself if your “boredom” isn’t 
just a method of self-distraction.
It also doesn’t hurt to realize 
that your teachers are giving up 
their time to teach you; browsing 
Facebook or Reddit might be more 
entertaining than Hooke’s Law, but 
you’re wasting both your time and 
your professor’s.
That’s not to say that everything 
lies on your shoulders alone. Your 
professors have a right to expect 
certain behaviors from you, but it’s 
a mutual relationship. You have the 
right to expect certain things from 
them in return, such as consistency. 
Most professors make a game plan, 
paste it at the front of their syllabus, 
and stick to it from the ?rst lecture 
to the last. Familiarize yourself with 
it. Know what to expect, and get to 
work preparing for it.
Professors also try to make them-
selves available to you, so make use 
of it. Go to of?ce hours. Most of your 
TAs, at least, will be actively invested 
in helping you succeed — why not 
help them help you? It won’t do you 
a drop of good if you’re cramming 
in the library at 5:30 p.m. instead 
of hanging out at Homework Center 
with your TAs. If you’re struggling, 
ask how you can improve or what 
you should expect on upcoming as-
signments.
A relationship with your profes-
sors and TAs can prove rewarding 
in other ways as well. If they’re in 
a department that you’re interested 
in, ask about opportunities to get in-
volved in extracurriculars, research, 
or internships. Get to know people 
— but as Dale Carnegie (author of 
How to Win Friends and In?uence 
People) noted, do so willingly. These 
people have a wealth of experience 
that they can share with you. Try 
your best to be genuinely interested 
in other people, and they’ll be happy 
to return the favor.
So that’s what you want from 
your professors. What should you 
want? At college, you gain more 
than just knowledge — you also gain 
the ability to use and care about that 
knowledge. Taking 15-150 might 
teach you SML syntax, but the pro-
fessor will instill in you a passion for 
functional ideas and programming. 
Learn to care about what you’re 
learning, and take every opportuni-
ty to better your chances of success.
And if that’s not enough, then 
consider this: Carnegie Mellon is 
a competitive, hard-working, and, 
ultimately, expensive school. So 
the next time you want to skip out 
on a biweekly morning lecture, just 
remember: You’re paying to be here. 
So suck it up, go to class, and learn.

As the calendar ?ips to Septem-
ber, major news outlets descend 
upon each poll that is released, dis-
secting the results and evaluating 
the effectiveness of the campaigns of 
the 22 candidates for the command-
er-in-chief of the United States. The 
candidates dig their toes into the 
party line, attempting to sway pri-
mary voters to back their campaigns.
September is an important time 
in presidential elections. Labor Day 
is often cited as the point that polls 
begin to carry signi?cant weight and 
the public’s focus turns to the elec-
tion. Of course, that is referring to 
Labor Day of 2016 and the general 
election. For the presidential cam-
paign to take up this much of the 
news media’s airtime more than one 
year out is not just absurd and an-
noying — it has real consequences.
The ?rst problem is that “election 
season” halts the political process. A 
good example is Obama’s Iran Deal. 
While diplomatic outreach to en-
emies is often controversial, it also 
usually gains at least some biparti-
san support. No one wants Iran to 
have nuclear weapons, and many 
people see a deal — especially one 
jointly negotiated with several al-
lies — as a meaningful alternative to 
war, which is unpopular with both 
parties. Instead, the deal has become 
one of the most politically polarizing 
points of Obama’s presidency as the 
Republicans look to foster ill will to-
wards the president and undermine 
the Democrats on foreign policy, an 
issue where the Democrats are often 
more popular.
A second problem is that the elec-
tion season being this long is a result 
of the blatantly undemocratic pri-
mary system. The system itself is in-
credibly opaque and easily changed, 
which gives the party conventions 
far too much say over who becomes 
president. The concept of “early vot-
ing” states like Iowa and New Hamp-
shire gives undue attention to issues 
only important in those states, as op-
posed to other issues, such as corn 
subsidies. 
A more compact primary would 
force presidential candidates to ap-
peal to all party voters, not just ones 
in states that happen to be early 
enough to matter. While some people 
say this gives some citizens a chance 
to meet the candidates, there’s no 
reason that looking for grassroots 
support through meet and greets in a 
more condensed series of primaries 
and caucuses would be impossible; 
they would just meet with more geo-
graphically diverse voters.
Further, it also prevents candi-
dates like Senator Lindsey Graham 
(R-SC) from running on single issues 
(in this case excessive hawkishness) 
in hopes of pulling more likely can-
didates to their preferred positions. 
This is a waste of media airtime and 
votes that occur before the candidate 
inevitably drops out.
Some people say the long elec-
tion season gives people more time 
to know the candidates, because it 
gives those running a chance to get 
their names out there. This argu-
ment relies on the idea that prima-
ries tend to be more substantive, 
while general elections tend to be 
about getting entrenched voters 
into the booths. This argument is 
?awed, however. Very few candi-
dates have rolled out meaningful 
and speci?c policy proposals at this 
stage, and will not do so until they 
have a safety net of some delegates 
after early voting states. They get 
their ideologies out, but those “ide-
ologies” change so quickly as the is-
sues meaningful to the public and 
the most popular positions shift that 
it becomes harder to reconcile the 
beginning of a political campaign 
with the end of it the longer election 
season goes.
A condensed primary would cut 
down on the amount of time candi-
dates have to “evolve” and provide 
a more democratic system through 
more equally impactful and more 
informed votes. It would also cut 
down the years of our lives we lost 
while contemplating Donald Trump 
as the president. That sounds like a 
win-win.

For most students, the end of the 
summer and the start of the school 
year come with a heavy supply of 
mixed feelings.
On one hand, you’re probably sad 
to be leaving behind the relative free-
dom and low stress of vacation—not 
to mention the warm weather. How-
ever, you’re also likely excited to re-
unite with school friends, take some 
intriguing new classes, and dive back 
into extracurriculars that keep you 
the best kind of busy.
While there are pros and cons to 
the back-to-school shift, every stu-
dent deserves to return to Carnegie 
Mellon life with minimal melancholy 
and maximum enthusiasm. There 
are several things you should keep in 
mind to ease the transition.
First, friends are your most valu-
able resource. During the summer, 
at-home friendships tend to have a 
more relaxed tone, since no one has 
deadlines hanging over their heads 
and you can concentrate on catch-
ing up and having fun. Now, you and 
all of your college friends are in the 
same, more stressful boat; sadly, you 
can no longer stay up all night just 
chilling without academic conse-
quence.
Instead of mourning that fact, 
reshape the dynamics of your friend-
ships around it to make school both 
easier and more enjoyable. Study-
ing and working with your friends, 
or even in the same room as them, 
is usually a good way to encourage 
productivity. Share with them what’s 
exciting you about your classes in 
order to amp up your own excite-
ment. Coax out the inner intellectual 
you’ve likely spent a few months ne-
glecting by bouncing new ideas off of 
them. When you’re all helping each 
other adjust to an academic mindset 
at the offset, you can avoid the trap 
of starting out with the bare mini-
mum and getting bogged down by 
responsibilities later.
That said, also spare some time 
for living a little. Even though fun 
and relaxation won’t reach peak 
summer levels, don’t go cold turkey 
on everything good in life either. 
You would be doing yourself a major 
disservice not to leave some wiggle 
room in your schedule for improvi-
sation, especially during the early 
adjustment weeks of the semester. 
Spontaneous activities can include 
everything from 10-minute study 
snack breaks, to Friday movie nights 
with the ?oormates, to embarking 
on a grand Pittsburgh adventure.
In your late teens and early twen-
ties, your potential has never been 
greater. Why not make good on some 
of that potential? Cultivate new ex-
periences, collect some stories, and 
remember that “student” doesn’t 
have to be the end-all, be-all of your 
identity.
At the same time, remind your-
self why you are a Carnegie Mellon 
student. It’s more likely than not 
because you have a passion for your 
academic ?eld or ?elds. It’s easy to 
moan about the stresses of student 
life, especially when you’ve just had 
a long respite from them. But there’s 
also something incredibly joyful 
about being in an environment ?lled 
with smart, dedicated, passionate 
people on the hunt for discovery. 
Each and every one of you is lucky to 
be here. Internalizing that is the best 
way to hit the ground running this 
new semester.
Lean on friends for transition back to school

Make the most of your time at CMU with passion, drive, and friendship
SATVIKA NETI 
Staffwriter
“You have to choose” is a myth 
that well-meaning people tell us 
throughout our lives. Choose a ma-
jor, choose a career, choose a goal. 
“Because you can’t do it all,” they 
say. I’m here to tell you that you can. 
But I’m also here to tell you that you 
don’t have to.
Carnegie Mellon can be a hard 
place sometimes, especially at ?rst. 
You’re not the smartest kid in the 
room anymore, and that can be 
shocking — it was for me. I spent a 
lot of my ?rst semester lying in bed 
watching How I Met Your Mother 
because I didn’t think I was good 
enough to do anything here.
What I learned, though, is that 
everyone at Carnegie Mellon is here 
because they’re passionate — about 
learning, about the world, about 
their chosen ?eld of study and often 
many ?elds outside it — and that if 
you can stand out at this school, you 
can stand out anywhere. Here’s how.
First of all, get up. Get out of bed. 
You are made up of the universe, so 
you can do this. I know that it’s warm 
in your bed, but do you know what’s 
warmer? That classroom that never 
turns down the heat, that’s what — 
and hey, you might get bonus points 
for being in class!
As much as you’d like to believe 
otherwise, it’s impossible to do 10 
hours of work in three hours. Pace 
yourself with ?ve-minute breaks ev-
ery hour or so. Even if you just spend 
them groaning loudly at your books 
or looking longingly at your bed, 
those ?ve minutes are integral to get-
ting back on track and ?nishing the 
work you have to do.
Take time away from drowning in 
work to be around people you like. 
It’s worth it to spend an hour or two 
just talking with someone, whether 
they’re an old friend or a new friend 
or a stranger at the coffee shop that 
randomly makes conversation with 
you. Even if you have work due later 
that night, you’ll like yourself more 
when you get around to it.
Feel free to whine about how 
much you have to do. Whine to ev-
eryone. Whine to your mother, your 
roommate, your friend, that random 
person serving you coffee, yourself, I 
don’t care — just do it and do it often. 
Not only is whining stress-relieving, 
but it can also help you to formulate 
a good mental checklist of what and 
how much you have to do; it’s a great 
way to get yourself in gear.
Blocking yourself off Tumblr or 
Facebook or your chosen Internet 
poison is not actually as effective as it 
sounds, because you’ll inevitably end 
up back on there. You’ll end up back 
there a lot. You will always ?nd dis-
tractions. The key is to put the phone 
down, click out of the tab, or at the 
very least give yourself a deadline 
of how long you can take a break, 
and then stick to it. You don’t want 
to be that person stuck in the library 
at three in the morning ?nishing a 
paper you could have had done by 
midnight if you hadn’t been scrolling 
through Reddit instead.
If you drink coffee or tea, make 
friends with the baristas at the cof-
feeshops on campus. They’ll always 
make your coffee just right and 
sometimes write cute messages on 
your cup, which is a great pick-me-
up if you’re having a bad day.
Work in groups. I can’t stress this 
one enough. Not only will you actu-
ally work because people will hold 
you accountable, but you’ll also im-
prove your understanding of the 
coursework when you have to ex-
plain things to others and you can 
get things explained to you.
Make friends with your profes-
sors and talk to them about your life. 
They actually care, I promise. Dur-
ing the last week of classes, ask them 
all the questions you ever wanted to 
ask, even ones as personal as “Why 
are you a Republican?” You’ll get in-
teresting answers.
Take time to help other peo-
ple with their homework, even if 
you’re done with it and you have 10 
million other things you need to be 
doing. Trust me, eventually you will 
need help on the homework and they 
will have 10 million things they need 
to be doing — they’ll stay to help you.
If you need a day to lay in bed and 
do nothing, and you will absolutely 
need those days, take some time off. 
But just a day — okay, maybe two 
days.
Keep your surroundings clean. 
You’ll be more motivated to do things 
when you don’t have to look piles of 
papers, laundry, or dirty dishes.
Go out and see the city. Pittsburgh 
is a wonderful place to live, and there 
are amazing things happening right 
off campus. Even if it’s just to go to 
half-price in Oakland, get out of the 
Carnegie Mellon bubble.
You’ll hear a lot about “stress 
culture” here: the idea that if you’re 
not doing more than everyone 
else around you, you’re not doing 
enough. It’s a real thing, and it’s per-
petuated a lot — don’t fall victim to 
it.
Find something that you love do-
ing here; if you want, ?nd multiple 
things! Even though you can do it 
all and you don’t have to choose one 
thing over another, don’t feel that 
you need to do more if it’s negatively 
affecting your physical or mental 
health.
Most of all, remember that you 
are doing enough. Remember that 
you are enough.

LETTER TO THE STUDENT BODY
Student Government, cabinet ready to tackle the new year
JR MARSHALL 
Student Body President
Dear Campus Community, it is 
so good to be back on campus and 
breathe in that good ole muggy Pitts-
burgh air again! The energy here is 
already insatiable; the excitement 
for the year is downright palpable.
When I look at the year ahead in 
terms of leading the student gov-
ernment, I consider it important 
for me to summarize the numer-
ous efforts already set forth by our 
Cabinet team. We’re very lucky 
to have a devoted and motivated 
group of students from every cor-
ner of campus excited to help my 
vice president Jibby and I make 
Carnegie Mellon a better place for 
every student. The following is just 
a glimpse of several efforts already 
underway from within our Presi-
dent’s cabinet.
Rachel Freer has been coordinat-
ing programing with Jess Klein, our 
coordinator of gender programs and 
sexual violence prevention, to ensure 
our incoming ?rst years begin their 
Carnegie Mellon careers as active 
participants in our campus move-
ment to completely eradicate sexual 
assault and relationship violence.
Siriana Abboud and the alumni 
association are working together to 
help our newest students get to know 
Carnegie Mellon through webinars 
and get-togethers. Siriana is also 
organizing student-faculty mixers 
to take place on campus to establish 
more personal relationships with our 
incredible faculty.
Thomas Preite is currently or-
ganizing several town halls to take 
place over the course of the semes-
ter. Jibby and I want to be the utmost 
advocates for every student point of 
view. We therefore aspire to better 
engage our community through stu-
dent government and these student-
centered town halls.
Jamie Earnest and Carnegie Mel-
lon INSPIRE are getting several stu-
dent projects off the ground through 
cross-collaboration and student gov-
ernment assistance
We will also be sure to utilize our 
marketing team, led by Jennifer Han 
and Gwen Luvara, to keep the stu-
dent body up-to-date on our prog-
ress. 
Our cabinet is already doing and 
will continue to do tremendous ser-
vice to our school, but we also need 
the participation of the student body 
now more than ever.
In order to make Carnegie Mel-
lon University a happier, healthier, 
and safer community for every stu-
dent, Jibby, myself and the Student 
Government need your input and for 
your voice to be heard. Attend our 
town halls, reach out to us at any 
time, and most of all, have an amaz-
ing start to the year.
Trump makes poor showing in Republican primary debate on Fox
IAN TANAYA 
Assistant Sports Editor
On Aug. 6, during the ?rst (tech-
nically second) Republican presi-
dential debate, Fox News anchors 
Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris 
Wallace worked as moderators to 
challenge each of the top ten Repub-
lican candidates with individually 
tailored questions.
For instance, Governor Scott 
Walker (R–WI) was asked a ques-
tion about the recent bill he signed 
into law banning abortions past 20 
weeks, even in cases of rape, incest, 
or severe fetal anomalies. Governor 
Chris Christie (R-NJ) was asked why 
the nation should trust him with the 
economy when New Jersey under 
his terms in of?ce ranked 44th in 
the nation in terms of job creation. 
Ben Carson was pointedly asked 
why, without any political experi-
ence, he could be trusted with the 
nation’s highest of?ce. Yet, none 
of these tough, targeted questions 
drew more ire and controversy than 
those asked to Donald Trump.
The businessman and current 
leader in the Republican ?eld im-
mediately found a target on his 
back when Baier opened the debate 
by asking if every candidate could 
promise to support the eventual 
nominee. Although directed to all 
the candidates, the question clearly 
targeted Trump, who has been con-
sidered most likely to make a third 
party run. Baier made it clear that 
his doing so would presumably hand 
the presidency to the Democratic 
nominee.
A question on immigration, 
the topic that has been the largest 
source of Trump’s political strength, 
was answered fairly well and re-
ceived applause from the undoubt-
edly conservative audience. How-
ever, a question that Kelly asked 
regarding Trump’s views on women 
has become the center of conserva-
tive backlash following the debate.
Kelly quoted Trump on his pre-
vious characterizations of women 
as “fat pigs,” “dogs,” and “slobs.” 
Though Trump attempted to de-
fuse the situation by joking that 
those insults were only against 
Rosie O’Donnell, Kelly would not 
be swayed. She pressed on with her 
question and asked how he would 
answer these charges to Hillary Clin-
ton, who would presumably charge 
him as a prosecutor of the “War on 
Women” and declare him un?t to be 
president on those grounds alone.
Trump initially answered fairly 
enough for his political message: 
that he has no time to be politically 
correct and that the nation needs 
leaders who act rather than worry 
about every word they say. He then 
went on to personally attack Kelly, 
drawing the ire of the audience 
watching the debate.
The post-debate backlash was 
immediate. Many Republicans were 
quick to criticize the entire debate, 
claiming that it had been far too 
tough on the candidates and that the 
Democratic debates would not have 
such hard questions from debates 
hosted by the mainstream media. 
Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck in 
particular scathingly criticized Fox 
News, claiming that the questions 
asked would hurt the Republicans in 
the general election. Undoubtedly, 
most of these criticisms were fueled 
by the apparent bias against Trump, 
beginning from Baier’s question at 
the start to Kelly’s question about his 
stance on women.
Most of the criticism comes down 
to Republicans’ fear that they have 
been abandoned by the one major 
television network they trust. Fox 
News has long been considered 
the Right Wing’s primary source 
for news, and will likely always be. 
However, longtime critics of the net-
work praised the debate coverage, 
as they should. In presenting tough, 
targeted questions to the candi-
dates, critics could not dismiss them 
as propaganda from the mainstream 
media.
The presidential debates have 
long been considered the most im-
portant component of the electoral 
process, and the moderators that 
mediate them should not pull their 
punches. If the Republican candi-
dates are unable to answer con-
troversial questions on a network 
favorable to the Right in front of a 
conservative audience, they will be 
very unlikely to maintain their poise 
when the time comes for a true 
challenge.
After the debate, Donald Trump 
continued his tirade on Twitter, 
preaching his victimhood in the Fox 
News hit job to whomever would 
listen. His most ardent support-
ers have ?led a petition to remove 
Megyn Kelly from future debates out 
of pure spite. He has continued to 
utilize his singular brand of political 
incorrectness to describe the issues 
facing the nation.
While political correctness may 
be overrated, the continued popu-
larity of a candidate with almost no 
substance is appalling. The backlash 
against Fox News from conserva-
tives and particularly from support-
ers of Trump makes it clear that Fox 
News did its job right. It provided a 
forum for debate that presented all 
the candidates to voters and uncov-
ered details about the candidates 
that have caused voters to re-evalu-
ate their support.
Moreover, it exposed Donald 
Trump for who he is: an opportunist 
who will lend his support to what-
ever side bene?ts him most, not a 
leader who could ful?ll his cam-
paign slogan ripped directly from 
Ronald Reagan. He has been shown 
to be petulant and angry at anyone 
who dares challenge his talking 
points. He has demonstrated that he 
has no way of backing up his bold 
rhetoric with action, the same trait 
he decries in other politicians. At the 
same time, his lack of substance has 
served to contrast him with other, 
more suitable candidates.
Trump will still have plenty of 
support, but his road to the Repub-
lican nomination has been greatly 
damaged by his own words and 
actions.

New technology improves detection of blood clots
Currently, there is no one 
method used to locate a blood 
clot in the body. Instead, ul-
trasound, magnetic resonance 
imaging, and computed to-
mography are used to view 
the legs, heart, and lungs, re-
spectively. A team of research-
ers at the Martinos Center for 
Biomedical Imaging at Massa-
chusetts General Hospital, in-
cluding faculty member Peter 
Caravan, has developed a new 
method that could identify 
blood clots in the body with a 
single full-body scan.
Caravan’s team created a 
blood clot probe by attaching 
a radionuclide, which can be 
detected anywhere in the body 
by positron emission tomogra-
phy (PET), to a peptide that 
binds speci?cally to ?brin, 
which is found in blood clots. 
The team tested several probes 
with various radionuclides in 
rats, and is now focusing on 
the ?brin binding probe #8 
(FBP8) that uses copper-64 as 
the radionuclide and has been 
determined to be most ef?-
cient. The team hopes to begin 
human testing in the fall.

Curbed carbon emissions could save farmers billions of dollars
Economist Brent Boehlert, 
a research af?liate of MIT, 
along with a team of research-
ers, has estimated that curbed 
carbon emissions could save 
farmers billions of dollars by 
2100 by reducing the frequen-
cy and severity of droughts.
Boehlert and colleagues 
analyzed the effect of tem-
perature and rainfall changes 
on droughts, and estimated 
that farmers will save approxi-
mately 980 million dollars an-
nually by 2050 if large-scale 
carbon emission cuts are made 
that keep atmospheric carbon 
dioxide concentrations below 
500 parts per million (ppm), as 
opposed to 1750 ppm, which 
is the expected atmospheric 
carbon dioxide concentration 
if no measures are taken. Less 
drastic cuts that keep carbon 
dioxide concentrations below 
600 ppm would save 390 mil-
lion dollars annually.

Flexible electronics offer wide variety of applications
Researchers at the Air 
Force Research Laboratory at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force 
Base are now able to replace 
rigid circuit boards with ?ex-
ible electronics by placing a 
thin silicon integrated circuit, 
only a few hundred nanome-
ters thick, on a bendable plas-
tic-like substrate.
This bendable format al-
lows circuitry to be placed in 
tight spaces or curved surfac-
es, such as airplane wings or 
a person’s skin. The research 
team at the Wright-Patterson 
Air Force Base are looking into 
a variety of applications for 
this new technology, including 
aircraft applications measur-
ing stresses and strains. The 
same technology is also being 
investigated as a way to moni-
tor pilots’ health. A wearable 
biosensor patch that monitors 
the body’s heartbeat, hydra-
tion, and temperature could 
indicate fatigue or cognitive 
problems. In both cases, infor-
mation could be relayed to a 
ground crew through the use 
of a small embedded antenna. 
The system could also moni-
tor conditions of bridges and 
other infrastructure.

Chinese writing on cave helps predict drought
Sebastian Breitenbach, a 
climate scientist at the Uni-
versity of Cambridge, along 
with a group of researchers, 
has found writing on the wall 
of Dayu Cave in the Qinling 
Mountains of central China 
that records information 
about droughts in the region 
between 1520 and 1920. The 
research team also analyzed 
stalagmites in Dayu Cave.
By analyzing stable iso-
topes of oxygen, carbon, ura-
nium, and other elements, the 
researchers determined that 
the years which the cave writ-
ing cited as years with little 
rainfall, correlated with high-
er oxygen and carbon isotope 
ratios. Using this discovery, 
the team created a precipita-
tion model for the region. The 
model aligned with a drought

Drones are poor choice for monitoring wildlife
Drones, or unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs), are 
becoming a popular method 
for studying wildlife, yet it 
has been suggested that they 
might cause stress or harm 
to the animals being studied. 
Mark Ditmer of the University 
of Minnesota, St. Paul, along 
with other researchers, stud-
ied the effect of a small UAV 
on four black bears, which 
were ?tted with GPS collars 
and heart monitors.
The researchers found that 
the bears’ heart rates rose 
drastically when the UAV was 
?own overhead. They also 
discovered that the animals’ 
response to the UAV was stron-
ger when the sound of the UAV 
approaching was masked by 
the wind. All four heart rates 
had returned to normal ap-
proximately 30 minutes after 
the UAV ?ew overhead. The 
researchers concluded that 
the animals were slightly, but 
not extremely, stressed by the 
UAV. They did note, however, 
that the bears being studied 
live in an area heavily impact-
ed by humans, and that wild 
animals might have a much 
stronger reaction.

New galaxy collision provides insight on collision rings
A team of astronomers at 
the University of Hong Kong 
and the University of Man-
chester have discovered a new 
galaxy collision, which occurs 
when two galaxies of similar 
mass collide and the resulting 
shockwaves form new stars. 
The galaxy collision, named 
Kathryn’s Wheel, is 30 mil-
lion light years away, which 
is about seven times closer 
to the Milky Way than any 
other galaxy collision found 
to date. The collision was ob-
served with the UK Schmidt 
Telescope in Australia dur-
ing a wide ?eld survey of the 
Southern Milky Way. The low 
mass of the galaxy collision 
suggests that collision rings 
can form around smaller gal-
axies than originally thought. 
Because smaller galaxies are 
more common, this implies 
that collision rings could be 
up to ten times more common 
than previously thought. The 
researchers intend to study 
the collision further with larg-
er telescopes.

Researchers ?nd rate at which developing brain prunes connections
JOSH BROWN

The human brain, a net-
work of billions of neurons 
that makes a myriad of com-
putations every second, is 
analogous to an immense 
computer. By studying this 
naturally occurring computer, 
researchers can draw conclu-
sions and apply them to arti-
?cially engineered computers, 
using the study of biology to 
enhance our understanding 
of computer science and vice 
versa.
Recently, faculty members 
at Carnegie Mellon have con-
ducted studies with research-
ers from the Salk Institute 
for Biological sciences, dem-
onstrating the link between 
computer science and biology 
by comparing the process of 
network creation in the brain 
to that of arti?cial computers.
In the simplest sense, a net-
work is a series of connections 
that allow communication and 
data transfer. For example, the 
brain is a network of neurons, 
and the internet is a network 
of computers. Engineered 
networks can also be infra-
structural — railroads and 
pipelines are also networks. 
These arti?cial networks 
have traditionally been built 
from the ground up, starting 
with very few connections 
and gradually making more. 
The brain, however, builds 
its network in the oppo-
site direction. During 
early development, 
the brain starts 
out with too 
many con-
nections, 
called 
synaps-
es, and 
under-
goes a 
process 
called 
pruning, 
which 
trims 
down the 
number of 
synapses and 
increases the brain’s 
ef?ciency.
“When you build a network 
by pruning, you over-connect 
and then pull back,” explained 
Alison Barth, a professor in 
Carnegie Mellon’s biological 
sciences department and a 
member of the BrainHubSM 
initiative. “It seems waste-
ful to make all of these con-
nections and then 
prune, but even though it is 
costly, there are huge advan-
tages to how the pruned net-
work performs.”
To come to this conclusion, 
Barth worked with Saket Nav-
lakha, an assistant pro-
fessor at 
the Salk Institute’s Center 
for Integrative Biology, and 
Ziv Bar-Joseph, an associate 
professor in Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Machine Learning De-
partment and Lane Center 
for Computational Biology. 
Navlakha developed an algo-
rithm that allowed the team 
to record the synaptic density 
in the brains of 41 sample 
animals — namely 
mice — across up-
wards of 16 de-
velopmental 
time-points. 
The data de-
termined 
that, 
during 
develop-
ment, 
the 
brains 
lost 
nearly 
50 per-
cent of their 
synapses. 
Further research 
found that the rate 
at which the brain 
prunes decreases during 
development, meaning 
the brain aggressively trims 
connections early in develop-
ment, and decreases the rate 
of pruning over time.
Through further experi-
mentation, the team also 
determined that pruned net-
works were more ef?cient and 
robust than the traditional 
ground-up model. While it 
may not be cost-effective to 
put this knowledge to use in in-
frastructural networks, there 
may be further applications 
in the realm of computer op-
timization. In the wake of this 
project, Barth said that there 
is still a long way to go before 
the brain and its processes can 
be truly understood.
“One thing that still re-
mains unknown,” she ex-
plained, “is exactly what com-
putations neural circuits are 
carrying. We don’t know what 
the little calculations are at 
each small step.” 
The one thing that is cer-
tain, however, is that the ?elds 
of biology and engineering 
are innately linked, and pro-
vide tremendous potential 
for future interdisciplinary 
discovery.

Researchers ?nd a more effective way to administer chemotherapy
JULIA NAPOLITANO
Assistant Scitech Editor
Researchers from Carnegie 
Mellon University, the Indus-
trial Technology Research 
Institute in Taiwan, and the 
University of Pittsburgh have 
discovered a way to more ef-
fectively administer platinum-
based nanodrugs that treat 
cancer by reducing their tox-
icity and improving their bio-
availabilities. Platinum-based 
drugs are commonly used in 
various chemotherapies which 
treat many types of cancer, but 
they, like other chemotherapy 
drugs, have adverse side ef-
fects. Most notably, they are re-
directed to the liver and spleen 
by a part of the immune system 
called the reticuloendothelial 
system (RES).
“The body’s immune sys-
tem, especially the liver and 
spleen, has been one of the 
biggest stumbling blocks

Targeted online ads found to show gender bias
SHARON WU
Staffwriter
Today, more than 3 billion 
people are connected to the 
World Wide Web, making the 
digital realm an ideal place 
for marketers and advertisers 
to promote their products, 
services, and opinions. Ever 
since the ?rst clickable web 
ad was sold in 1993 by Global 
Network Navigator to a San 
Francisco law ?rm, online ad-
vertising has been advancing, 
to the point where online ads 
can be customized to ?t a us-
er’s interests and needs.  But 
as online ads have become 
more speci?cally tailored to 
each user, researchers sug-
gest that advertisers unfairly 
target users of a particular 
demographic.
A recent study conducted 
by a team of researchers in-
cluding Anupam Datta, an 
associate professor of com-
puter science and electrical 
and computer engineering at 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
focused on Google ads shown 
to users with different ad set-
tings. Datta’s study of Google 
online ads is part of an over-
arching goal to learn more 
about the scienti?c founda-
tions of security and privacy. 
Datta started the project 
with Amit Datta, a doctoral 
student in Carnegie Mellon’s 
electrical and computer en-
gineering department, and 
Michael Tschantz, a former 
doctoral student at Carnegie 
Mellon University who is 
currently a researcher at the 
International Computer Sci-
ence Institute at the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley.
 In their study, the re-
search group used AdFisher, 
a tool they designed to run 
automated experiments on 
customized ad settings. The 
tool runs 1000 browsers, 
simulating 500 female users 
and 500 male users. The gen-
der of each simulated user

systems,” said Chien Ho, an 
alumni professor of biologi-
cal sciences at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, in a university 
press release. “When the drugs 
collect in those organs, they 
become less available to treat 
the cancer, and can also cause 
toxicity.”
On average, a total of one 
to ten percent of the drug ends 
up reaching the tumor, while 
between 40 and 80 percent of 
the drug is redirected to the 
liver and spleen.
In a study published on 
June 3 in Scienti?c Reports, “A 
New Approach to Reduce Tox-
icities and Improve Bioavail-
abilities of Platinum-Contain-
ing Anti-Cancer Nanodrugs,” 
the researchers discuss their 
strategy of using Intralipid 20 
percent, an FDA-approved fat 
emulsion, as a pre-treatment 
to the platinum-based anti-
cancer drug DACHPt/HANP. 
The use of Intralipid decreased 
toxicity and increased bio-
availability — the absorption 
rate — of the drug by inhibit-
ing RES function.
According to the report, the 
researchers’ studies “show that 
Intralipid pre-treatment can 
be used to reduce RES uptake 
and side effects, and improve 
the bioavailability and clinical 
applications of Pt-containing 
nanodrugs. Moreover, [the 
researchers] have observed 
that Intralipid treatment can 
decrease Pt accumulation in 
kidney, thus reducing nephro-
toxicity of the Pt drug.”
The study reports that a 
single dosage of Intralipid re-
duced platinum accumulation 
in the liver by 20.4 percent, in 
the spleen by 42.5 percent, and 
in the kidneys by 39.3 percent 
after 24 hours. The bioavail-
ability of DACHPt/HANP also 
increased by 18.7 percent after 
?ve hours and 9.4 percent af-
ter 24 hours, respectively.
The researchers also re-
ported that using Intralipid 
as a pre-treatment reduced 
spleen enlargement and de-
creased apoptotic kidney cells, 
both common side effects of 
DACHPt/HANP.
Based on their results, the 
researchers believe that “cli-
nicians might be able to give 
the patients more anti-cancer 
nanodrugs to kill the tumors 
with less toxic side effects.”
“The outcome of this study 
has the potential to decrease 
the toxic side effects of anti-
cancer nanodrugs and other 
nanodrugs, and, therefore, to 
reduce human suffering,” the 
report states. “Our ?ndings 
for the use of Intralipid with 
nanodrugs can also lead to the 
reduction of healthcare costs 
as well as to the improvement 
of the quality of life for pa-
tients who undergo the thera-
peutic treatment.”
The research was funded 
by the National Institute of 
Health and Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Disruptive Health 
Technology Institute.

Carnegie Mellon researchers investigate fairness of online ads
setting page, which is meant 
to provide users some control 
over the ads they receive on-
line. Before the experiment, 
the researchers ensured that 
gender was the only differ-
ence between the two groups.
The browsers were then di-
rected to top 100 websites for 
employment that were listed 
on Alexa, an Amazon-owned 
company that provides web 
traf?c data services. A built-
in feature of AdFisher enables 
the browsers to collect ads on 
any of the visited websites. 
www.TimesofIndia.com, the 
website of a popular newspa-
per, was chosen for most of 
the experiments as it provided 
the most Google ads per page 
reload.
“AdFisher then used ma-
chine learning and statistical 
analysis to identify the differ-
ences among the ads served 
to the males and females,” 
Anupam Datta explained in 
an email interview with The 
Tartan.
The results showed that 
an ad from a career coaching 
service, with 
the prom-
ise of high-
paying 
executive 
level jobs, 
was target-
ed signi?-
cantly more 
towards men 
than women. 
The study 
determined 
that male 
users were 
shown the ad 
1816 times, 
while women 
were only 
shown the add 
311 times.
“We were 
surprised and 
concerned by 
this ?nding,” 
Anupam Datta 
said.
While the 
results from 
AdFisher detect 
discrimination 
in Google’s ad 
targeting, it does 
not provide a full 
picture as to why 
this is happen-
ing. Datta and his 
colleagues have 
several theories 
as to what caused 
the phenomenon. 
Google’s targeting 
algorithm may have 
learned that males 
are more likely to 
click on a particu-
lar ad than females, 
and therefore used 
that information to 
promote more relevant ad 
targeting. It is also possible 
that the advertisers them-
selves chose to target males 
over females, a request that 
could easily be carried out 
by Google’s massive, auto-
mated advertising system. 
The researchers believe that 
it is unlikely that Google pro-
grammed their advertising 
ecosystem to show a bias to-
ward male users over female 
users.
The researchers also noted 
the possibility that the results 
were in?uenced by Google’s 
security measures to detect 
robots. “Indeed, it is possible 
that Google suspected that 
the browser activities were 
conducted by bots rather 
than humans in our experi-
ments and therefore treated 
them differently,” Datta said. 
“However, we consider it un-
likely that they decided to 
serve ads in a discriminatory 
manner after making such a 
determination.”
The root of the issue lies 
within what are called “black 
boxes,” algorithms or other 
programs whose 
inner workings are unknown.
“In today’s society, impor-
tant decisions in many sectors 
are being made by a com-
bination of algorithms and 
humans who act from within 
black boxes,” Datta stated. 
“Their operation is not trans-
parent to the people who are 
subjected to these decisions, 
making it dif?cult to hold 
them accountable for undesir-
able outcomes.”
To study the lack of 
transparency in Google’s ad 
system, the researchers had a 
group of simulated users visit 
top websites for substance 
abuse, while another group of 
simulated users was idle. The 
substance abuse visitors were 
exposed to more ads for alco-
hol and drug rehabilitation 
centers, but Datta and his col-
leagues noticed that the con-
trol group did not receive any 
of those ads.
Furthermore, the search 
for substance abuse had no 
effect on the Google Ad Set-
tings page, perhaps for the 
same reasons that targeted 
ads seemed to produce gender 
discrimination. However, the 
researchers suspect that the 
results may be due to remar-
keting, in which an advertise-
ment from a visited website 
continues to follow the user 
on the Internet.
While Google did not of?-
cially address these ?ndings, 
the company has recently re-
worded its ad settings page 
to indicate the limits of users’ 
control over what is targeted 
to them.
Even as Google utilizes per-
sonal data to produce more 
relevant advertising, its lack of 
transparency may set up sys-
tems for unintentional abuse, 
such as helping to maintain 
the gender gap in salaries. 
“Online advertisements and 
recommendations are a gate-
way to opportunities, and this 
form of differential treatment 
based on gender can unfairly 
limit opportunities,” Datta ex-
plained.
Currently, the researchers 
are working with Microsoft 
to develop tools that can of-
fer more internal oversight of 
information processing eco-
systems, particularly the ad 
ecosystem. 
Datta expects that there 
will be more work done in 
making companies more ac-
countable when concerning 
behaviors, including discrimi-
nation, arise from their infor-
mation systems. His group 
believes that using AdFisher 
will help identify violations in 
black box information systems 
during future studies.
“Our research ?ndings 
provide the ?rst proof of ex-
istence of discrimination in 
online behavioral advertis-
ing,” stated Datta. “Thus dem-
onstrating that the problem 
exists in practice, not just in 
theory.”

How Things Work: Crowdfunding
DANIELLE HU
Staffwriter
Aspiring artists, ambi-
tious entrepreneurs, and 
passionate believers, listen 
in. Whether you’re a group 
of college students who 
want to create a start-up, or 
a broke art student in need 
of supplies for an upcoming 
assignment, the power of 
technology is here to deliver 
a fast means of communi-
cating your monetary needs 
to the world.
Crowdfunding, an in-
creasingly popular prac-
tice, is a way for people 
to advertise products and 
solicit funding through 
the Internet. The concept 
is easy to understand: Use 
the internet to promote 
your idea, and ask people 
from all around the world 
to ?nancially support it. Al-
though this idea is simple, 
it remains a powerful tool 
for anyone with access to 
the web. According to www.
howstuffworks.com, crowd-
funding generated over 6.1 
billion dollars in 2013, 16.2 
billion dollars in 2014, and 
is projected to raise over 
34.4 billion dollars in this 
upcoming year.
As opposed to venture 
capitalism, or any other 
type of investment method, 
crowdfunding focuses 
on drawing small 
support from large 
crowds. Instead of 
a direct ?nancial return for 
these supporters, campaign 
founders typically give back 
in these campaigns with 
small, non-monetary, and 
inexpensive returns. So in-
stead of borrowing money 
from large corporations 
and having to return that 
amount of money with add-
ed interest, crowdfunders 
borrow money from numer-
ous individuals and show 
their appreciation by offer-
ing discounts or providing 
special insights to their proj-
ect.
Crowdfunding websites, 
such as Kickstarter and Indi-
egogo, handle and maintain 
their policies differently. 
All crowdfunding websites 
charge campaigns that have 
reached their goals a fee, 
typically three to ten per-
cent. Some of these websites 
allow campaigns to keep the 
money that they made, even 
if their goal wasn’t reached, 
whereas other websites 
make it a requirement for 
a project to reach its goal 
before giving the campaign 
founder funds.
Kickstarter supports the 
“all or nothing” approach, 
where project creators only 
receive the money that 
backers have donated if 
their goals are met. The idea 
centers around the concept 
that without the initial goal 
of the project being met, 
the project would not con-
tinue on after the crowd-
funding campaign. A lack 
of supporters indicates that 
the product isn’t successful 
enough to back, and so the 
supporters who did contrib-
ute funds to the campaign 
are not charged for what 
they pledged. On the other 
side, Indiegogo allows cam-
paign heads to choose be-
tween the “all or nothing” 
approach, called ?xed fund-
ing, or an approach that 
lets them keep the funds, 
regardless of the goal being 
met, called ?exible funding.
The strictness of these 
policies span over a variety 
of conditions. Kickstarter 
stands on the more strict 
side of the spectrum, moni-
toring and approving all 
projects that are submitted 
to the site. But it’s counter-
part, Indiegogo makes it 
possible to submit just about 
any project, with the excep-
tion of some standards for 
legal and ethical purposes. 
Most of these crowdfunding 
companies have also shifted 
toward prohibiting product 
renderings and simulations 
in campaign videos. This 
rule prevents campaigns 
from misleading the public 
about the progress of their 
products.
Unfortunately, turning 
to crowdfunding will not al-
ways garner success. In fact, 
according to Kickstarter’s 
mid-2015 report, projects 
have a 37.3 percent success 
rate. A more frightening 
statistic is that 14 percent of 
projects never raise a single 
cent. Although those num-
bers may seem discourag-
ing, know that a man named 
Zach “Danger” Brown raised 
55,492 dollars from 6,911 
backers over the course of 
a month to make potato sal-
ad. Although Brown set out 
for a goal of ten dollars, he 
instead received over 5500 
times that goal.
Popular projects range 
from creative art projects, 
such as indie ?lms or tele-
vision movie reboots, to 
desired technological ad-
vances, such as the Pebble 
Smartwatch. There is no 
secret formula to guaran-
tee a successful campaign, 
however, based on statistics, 
crowdfunding companies 
continue to offer tips on 
how to run a campaign.
For example, crowdfund-
ing campaigns that include 
a quality video clip under 
three minutes explaining 
their project have a success 
rate two to three times high-
er than those that rely solely 
on printed word. A key to 
successful crowdfunding 
projects is advertising and 
publicizing the project. An 
initial anchor of support 
from family and friends is 
often needed to 
help build         
momentum for a campaign. 
After the initial support, 
often times a meaningful 
story behind the product or 
the creators helps push the 
funding to its set goal.
So if you’re ever looking 
for a way to raise money 
in today’s modern world, 
crowdfunding is an excel-
lent and easily accessible 
way to achieve this goal. If 
you ever ?nd yourself start-
ing a Kickstarter, look up 
previously successful proj-
ects and take hints from 
their campaigns. Simple 
ideas, such as timing your 
campaign to ?nish near the 
end of the month when peo-
ple receive their paychecks, 
or hiring a professional vid-
eographer, may have seri-
ous bene?ts. At the end of 
the campaign, make sure 
to understand the responsi-
bilities behind the promises 
made towards your back-
ers, especially details that 
are easy to overlook, such as 
shipping costs. Be mindful, 
be unique, be calm, and who 
knows, maybe one day you’ll 
fund your potato salad.

been known for until last year. 
Offensive coordinator Todd 
Haley managed to turn the 
Steelers offense into a dynam-
ic unit last year that saw quar-
terback Ben Roethlisberger 
have his best statistical season 
in the league.
Running back Le’Veon Bell 
proved to be made for more 
than just the Steelers’ tradi-
tional run-heavy offense with 
his ability to make big plays 
from dump-off passes, and he 
offered a much needed rushing 
threat to allow Roethlisberger 
some room from defenses that 
had to honor Bell’s talent.
The receiving corps are 
certainly some of the most tal-
ented Pittsburgh has ever had. 
Wide receiver Antonio Brown 
challenged Detroit Lions wide 
receiver Calvin Johnson for 
the title of best wide receiver 
in the league; though Johnson 
was rated higher on NFL Net-
work’s annual Top 100 Play-
ers list, Brown certainly came 
close for his dynamic contribu-
tions last season.
Receivers Markus Whea-
ton and Martavis Bryant both 
capitalized on the attention 
defenses had to give to Brown, 
combining for almost 1,200 
yards and scoring plenty 
of touchdowns. Tight end 
Heath Miller remains a steady 
commodity for the offense, 
catching passes and blocking 
for others with almost equal 
ease.
Most importantly, the of-
fensive line, long considered 
a weakness for the Steelers 
given how often opposing de-
fenses had managed to get to 
Roethlisberger even if the line 
did not take him down, has 
undergone a remarkable boost 
over the past few years. With 
the support of offensive line 
coach Mike Munchak, the of-
fensive linemen have formed 
an elite unit, particularly with 
young talent like center Maur-
kice Pouncey and right guard 
David DeCastro.
Overall, the Steelers seem 
poised to make a serious play-
off run, though exactly how 
long it will last will likely de-
pend on their success in the 
regular season. Pittsburgh 
certainly has the talent to win 
the AFC North, but Cincinnati 
and Baltimore will undoubt-
edly make strong challenges 
for that title. Among the elite 
teams in the AFC, the Steelers 
defense will surely be tested 
when they face the likes of the 
Denver Broncos, New Eng-
land Patriots, and Indianap-
olis Colts; however, armed 
with an offense that can 
match every point their foes 
score, the Pittsburgh Steelers 
have every reason to believe 
that they can bring home yet 
another Super Bowl victory .
Steelers face questions on their defensive line this season
Some teams win, others lose in NBA Free Agency
mascot bruiser and terri?c 
post defender, to bloated con-
tracts from the Mavericks and 
the Knicks respectively for no 
compensation again.
This was all after they had 
already traded away forward 
Nic Batum. Credit to him, Os-
hley didn’t just give up and 
go on full on Sixers level tank 
mode. The Blazers have made 
solid low-risk, high reward 
moves by offering talented 
but unpolished players such 
as Al-Farouq Aminu and Ed 
Davis above market deals to 
give them suf?cient playing 
time in a proven system suit-
ed to a lot of their strengths. 
Hopefully some of his moves 
work out, otherwise Oshley 
and his coach Terry Stotts 
will be very worried about 
the drop in talent level at the 
franchise.
Dallas Mavericks
At one point the Mavs 
seemed like locks to land on 
the former list. They had se-
cured a verbal commitment 
from Wes Matthews and with-
in the next couple of days had 
a commitment from center 
DeAndre Jordan as well. With 
just a point guard to look for, 
it seemed like the Mavs had 
the potential to become a ma-
jor contender in the bloodbath 
that is the Western conference. 
Then the Jordan NBA reality 
show of July 8 happened, leav-
ing the entire world laughing, 
and the Mavs fuming.
At the end of the day, the 
Mavs let center Tyson Chan-
dler and guard Monta Ellis 
walk, and only have a recover-
ing-from-Achilles-surgery Wes 
Matthews to show for it. 
Their only real salvation 
could come in the signing of 
guard Deron Williams, who 
has looked worse with every

BikeFest promotes safe biking in Pittsburgh
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
In 1994 the Community 
Design Center of Pittsburgh 
began the foremost bicycling 
event in the Pittsburgh re-
gion, PedalPGH. The event, 
a mass bicycle ride, was de-
signed to bring many cyclists 
together to raise money and 
make Pittsburgh a more bike 
friendly city.
In 2012 BikePGH, a bicycle 
advocacy group, took over 
the event and merged it with 
their signature event, Bike-
Fest, which began in 2005. 
BikeFest is a city wide cel-
ebration of biking featuring 
not just the PedalPGH ride, 
but a huge number of biking 
themed events and a kickoff 
party described on their site 
as “an all-night rager.” The ten 
day celebration of bicycle cul-
ture brings the city’s cyclists 
together and helps BikePGH 
grow and advocate for making 
Pittsburgh a more bicycle-safe 
city.
Advocacy director of BikeP-
GH Eric Boerer began BikeFest 
itself as a large event in 2005, 
but the festival reached a new 
level of popularity after add-
ing PedalPGH in 2012, when it 
became a signature event and 
serves as the ?nale of the ten 
days. PedalPGH features three 
routes that take bike riders 
through the city, including a 
car free environment that pro-
vides the safe ride for bikers 
that BikePGH advocates for.
The events themselves 
began August 21 and will 
stretch over ten days. Each 
has its own contribution to 
BikePGH’s promotion of bi-
cycle culture. Some events 
provide lessons, such as the 
Con?dent City Cycling class, 
which will teach riders how 
to safely navigate city streets. 
Others, such as Monster Trike 
Night and the bluntly named 
Unicycles Are a Thing, provide 
an opportunity for festival at-
tendees to be silly and have 
fun in the name of bikes.
Try-A-Bike Jamboree al-
lows riders to bring in all 
sorts of bikes and showcases 
the innovation and variety 
that bikes feature. The event 
is a mainstay of BikeFest and 
takes the heart of bike culture, 
the bicycles themselves, to the 
forefront to show riders what 
kinds of options are out there.
In recent years Pittsburgh 
has vastly improved its bicy-
cling infrastructure, but the 
bene?ts of biking have cre-
ated far-reaching demand. 
Bikes offer cheap and environ-
mentally friendly commuting 
in addition to being a form of 
exercise or even a fun pastime 
for many people. With bike 
ridership up, BikePGH con-
tinues to try and improve the 
number of bike lanes and even 
bike-only sections of road to 
improve Pittsburgh for bikers.
The event brings all of 
Pittsburgh’s cyclists together 
in order to create awareness 
and raise money to help Pitts-
burgh’s biking community 
thrive.

“Defense wins champion-
ships.”
Despite the effects of player 
safety rules that have allowed 
offenses to gain more yardage 
and score more points than 
ever before, defense remains 
the top priority for any team 
that wants a shot at Super 
Bowl glory. This was proven 
more than convincingly when 
the Seattle Seahawks deci-
mated the Denver Broncos in 
Super Bowl XLVIII.
Defense has always been 
the key to success in the AFC 
North, and the Pittsburgh 
Steelers have known it since 
the days of the Steel Curtain 
in the 1970s. Competition on 
the defensive front, however, 
has been very tough. The 
Baltimore Ravens, Cincin-
nati Bengals, and Cleveland 
Browns, Pittsburgh’s rivals 
in the AFC North, all sported 
top-10 defenses at some point 
in the 2014 season.
Although Cleveland is 
hardly a threat with an of-
fense that doesn’t know what 
to expect from new quarter-
back Johnny Manziel after let-
ting go of quarterback Brian 
Hoyer, the Bengals and the 
Ravens will certainly stand as 
enormous obstacles to Pitts-
burgh’s return to the play-
offs, and the Ravens almost 
certainly pose a substantial 
threat if both teams face each 
other in January.
What stands out for the 
2015 Steelers is the number of 
question marks on the defense 
following a very weak perfor-
mance last year by the Steel-
ers’ lofty standards. While 
the Steelers’ run defense was 
sixth in the league last year, 
their pass rush was markedly 
weaker, ranking only 26th in 
sacks. The linebacker corps, 
however, are undeniably 
ready to pressure opposing 
quarterbacks.
Veterans like linebackers 
James Harrison and Law-
rence Timmons provide the 
team with tremendous leader-
ship and production, and the 
young talents like linebackers 
Ryan Shazier and Bud Dupree 
are ready to become a part 
of the long legacy of Steeler 
greats. Their secondary 
though, will have to quickly 
establish a new identity with 
the loss of longtime strong 
safety Troy Polamalu and cor-
nerbacks Ike Taylor and Brice 
McCain.
After the Steelers ?nished 
27th in the league in pass-
ing yards allowed and mak-
ing only 11 interceptions all 
season, someone will have to 
step up in order to revitalize 
the team’s defense. Rookie 
cornerbacks Senquez Golson 
and Doran Grant are both 
promising talents to shore up 
the Steelers secondary, but 
veteran players like corner-
backs William Gay and Cortez 
Allen will have to lead the sec-
ondary to traditional Steelers 
expectations. Taking on the 
offensive juggernauts in the 
league will prove to be a chal-
lenge for this unit, and only 
time will tell whether or not 
they are ready for this task.
The offense, on the other 
hand, stands ready to take 
on any defense in the league, 
something Pittsburgh hasn’t

NBA Free Agency comes with surprises for many
NISHANT RENIWAL 
Staffwriter
The beginning of Free 
Agency 2015 was as frantic as 
anyone in the NBA has ever 
seen. $1.4 billion was com-
mitted to players on July 1 
as teams gave huge contracts 
to retain players who would 
command a much higher 
salary a year later, with the 
massive cap boom of 2016 
looming. It would be hard to 
call anyone a real loser of free 
agency with the draft always 
a way to load up on talent, 
but there were some clear 
winners and losers this time 
around.
Winners
San Antonio Spurs
The Spurs were favored 
heavily as the eventual land-
ing spot of top free agent for-
ward LaMarcus Aldridge, and 
they delivered on that front as 
Aldridge signed a 4 year, $80 
million deal to leave Portland 
after nine years. While that 
deal on its own would com-
fortably make them winners 
of the offseason, the other 
moves they managed to pull 
off while luring Aldridge 
away from his other suitors 
set them apart.
Forward Kawhi Leonard 
was locked down to 5 year, 
$90 million max contract as 
soon as free agency began. 
The deal represents a mild 
bargain already, given how 
important he is to their of-
fense and defense, but ac-
counting for his development 
and potential as an MVP can-
didate this season or next the 
contract is an absolute steal. 
An even bigger bargain is the 
4 year, $45 million deal they 
got guard/forward Danny 
Green to accept. 3-and-D 
“specialists” are usually play-
ers pro?cient in one of those 
skills, but Green is truly a 
player who’s absolutely elite 
at both. His ?t in the Spurs 
system is impeccable and 
when compared to the 4 year, 
$70 million contract Dallas 
Mavericks guard Wes Mat-
thews and 4 year, $65 mil-
lion contract Toronto Raptors 
forward DeMarre Carroll got, 
the Spurs saved a ton of mon-
ey for equal production.
Returning the best wing 
rotation in the league along 
with one of the top-5 big men 
would be enough, but RC Bu-
ford and Gregg Popovich had 
a few more tricks up their 
sleeve. David West signed at 
the veteran’s minimum and 
both forward/center Tim 
Duncan and guard Manu 
Ginobili return at bargain 
deals for one ?nal run at the 
title. This has the potential to 
be Pop’s best roster ever, and 
all signs point towards him 
making it count.
Milwaukee Bucks
The suitor list for big time 
free-agent center Greg Mon-
roe was not too long, but he 
had the two biggest markets 
in the league chasing him. 
The Los Angeles Lakers and 
the New York Knick made 
it clear that they would be 
willing to pay him top dollar 
to secure his commitment. 
Since no major contenders 
required this type of player, 
one of those teams was con-
sidered a near lock to lure 
him to their roster. In a near 
unthinkable move, one of 
the premier offensive centers 
in the league chose one of 
the smallest markets in the 
league, with considerably 
worse living conditions over 
the two behemoths.
While it goes a long way 
toward showing how dire the 
state of those teams is, lets 
not take credit away from 
the Bucks front of?ce as they 
pulled off a major coup and 
instantly made the team one 
to watch in the putrid East-
ern conference. Oh, they also 
took care of business by lock-
ing down guard Khris Mid-
dleton to a ?ve-year deal as 
early as possible on a bargain 
contract, considering the cap 
boom of next summer, espe-
cially if he continues improv-
ing as projected. All things 
considered, it’s been a terri?c 
summer for Jason Kidd.
Losers
Portland Trailblazers
Where can you begin? 
General manager Neil Oshley 
knew at the beginning of the 
summer that he had one very 
important target to achieve 
and everything came after 
that. It cannot be overstated 
how important Aldridge was 
to this franchise. He was their 
player since the draft, he was 
their franchise superstar de-
spite the emergence of guard 
Damian Lillard, and more 
frequently than not he was 
the man bailing them out 
game after game every single 
season. Losing a player of his 
caliber for nothing in return 
would already make it an aw-
ful summer, but the Blazers 
managed to lose Matthews, 
one of the top 3-and-D play-
ers and the heart of the team, 
as well as center Robin Lopez, 
Steelers looking forward to a strong offensive season

The Sex is in the Heel
Kinky Boots comes to Pittsburgh in style with CMU Alumni
When thinking of theater and dramatic arts, a few differ-
ent places might come to mind: New York, Los Angeles, 
Chicago, maybe even Michigan or Boston. Pittsburgh, 
however, most certainly wouldn’t be at the top of that list 
unless you were somewhat involved in the entertainment 
world. Although Carnegie Mellon is well known in the com-
puter science and engineering fields, its contributions to 
the arts have not been as widely promoted. Alumnae have 
gone on to earn Academy Awards, Grammys, Emmys, and 
Tonys. In recent years, the Tony Awards have been domi-
nated by Tartan alumnae. Two years ago, the Best Actor 
and Best Actress in a Musical categories were both won 
by former Carnegie Mellon students. And on Aug. 8, I was 
lucky enough to have the opportunity to go to the Benedum 
Center and watch Billy Porter (CFA ‘91) reprise his role as 
Lola in Kinky Boots.
Kinky Boots is the 2013 winner of the Tony Award for Best 
Musical. It tells the story of a man who loses everything and 
risks the one thing he has left, his father’s factory, on a wild 
(for the time) idea: boots for drag queens. In the process of 
saving his father’s legacy, he meets Lola, played by Porter, 
a drag queen who shows him everything he needs to know 
about life, love, people, and boots. Boots are important, heels 
are important, and red is important. These are all things I 
have learned from the musical in a song about heels.
The show-stopping number “The Sex is in the Heel” is an 
iconic musical theater number that just lets you know how 
much production musical theater actually involves. Lights, 
sets, props, dancers, song, music, costumes: Kinky Boots 
had everything you could ask for from a big Broadway 
musical, all in downtown Pittsburgh. The production was 
truly amazing, and Billy Porter gave such an impressive 
performance that after a number in the second act (that he 
nailed) the entire crowd gave him a full 2 minute standing 
ovation, mid-act.
Billy Porter also visited the campus while he was in 
Pittsburgh to see his old professors and mentors in the 
School of Drama. He is a proud alumnus who constantly 
gives thanks to his education at Carnegie Mellon and 
truly showcases how impressive the School of Drama is. 
Recently, it was recognized as one of the top schools in the 
nation, getting high marks in every category.
In my four years attending Carnegie Mellon, I have had 
the privilege of attending most plays and musicals that the 
School of Drama has put on and the operas of the School of 
Music. The productions over the years have ranged from 
Sweeney Todd to The Mad Party to The Crucible, and have 
all been impressive in their own ways. Carnegie Mellon 
constantly strives for greatness, and if you’re looking to find 
some great theater,well, you’ve come to the right place.

Advice for awkward people
“Dear Josh,
I am a sophomore 
with a double major 
in philosophy and 
computer science, 
and while I totally 
have tens of friends 
and a relatively 
decent social 
network, I find 
myself regrettably 
partnerless. Some 
nights, I get to 
thinking. In a 
romantic way. In a 
deep emotional way. 
In a good time lovin’ 
kind of way. I want 
to get metaphysical. 
Metaphysical. I think 
it’s time to get out 
there, maybe take 
some risks. I don’t 
know any moves, 
and the thought of 
putting myself out 
there makes me 
sweaty. Do you in 
your ultimate wisdom 
have any advice on 
how to approach the 
realm of courting?
Cheers, 
Righteously Ornery 
Bodacious Officious 
Friend Reaching 
Euphorically 
UnderNeath 
Dresses.”
Dear ROBOFREUND,
Personally, I don’t see 
the reason to enter 
into the “realm of 
courting” if you’re so 
apprehensive about it. 
Given your training in 
computer science and 
the rising acceptance 
of dating simulators, 
you can try to redirect 
this romantic frustration 
into a lucrative career 
choice. My advice? 
Tailor-design a dating 
SIM around your 
deepest, most personal 
fantasies. Intimacy in 
media is about more 
than just the physical: 
It’s the metaphysical 
that counts. It’s about 
that entrance into 
someone else’s life 
and connecting on all 
circuits. If you really 
pour all of your heart 
and your fantasies into 
the story’s creation, 
hopefully someone 
will see that passion 
and they’ll purchase 
and play it. Then 
you’ll achieve both 
financial success and 
a romantic connection 
you may not be able to 
achieve from traditional 
dating.

When students arrive at Carnegie Mellon, they often 
?nd that the campus is a fascinating place with its 
outgoing student body, research initiatives, and unusual 
creations. The campus offers more than enough to keep 
students busy during their time at the university, but 
beyond the campus is an entire city to explore. Not only 
is Pittsburgh located in a unique geographic location 
nestled among rivers, but it is broken into various 
neighborhoods and districts that have their own distinct 
?avors. Use this guide to navigate these neighborhoods, 
which shouldn’t be missed by any Carnegie Mellon 
student.
Strip District
Vibe: An old riverside warehouse district transformed 
into a regional culinary destination.
Best eats: For everything from steamy espresso to fresh 
cooked pasta straight from the heart of Italy, Enrico 
Biscotti Company has you covered. And no, we don’t 
mean the small bakery (although you could de?nitely 
?ll up on delicious biscotti there). Nestled behind the 
bakery is the restaurant portion of the business, which is 
an authentic family favorite and crowd pleaser.
Best attraction: Sure, this area is great during a normal 
day, but by the time you graduate, you must go during 
its peak business hours: Saturday and Sunday mornings. 
The street market explodes with people, food, ?owers, 
and fun little shops.
Travel tip: If you can borrow a car, do it. The buses that 
take you to the Strip are few and far between.
Downtown
Vibe: The only area of Pittsburgh that really feels like a 
traditional East Coast city; skyscrapers and congested 
streets galore.
Best eats: Meat and Potatoes was the hip and trendy 
Euro-style gastropub that was a gastropub before it was 
cool. Though de?nitely a more expensive restaurant, the 
food here is unbeatable: delectable and surprising at the 
same time. Take a date, make sure to get a drink from 
their fabulous selection, and then enjoy a night on the 
town.
Best attraction: Seviche, a Mexican/Cuban restaurant 
on Penn Avenue, hosts a learn-to-salsa dance class every 
Monday night starting at 9 p.m., and then at 10 p.m., the 
?oor opens for a night of sultry dancing and late night 
snacks. The music plays until nearly 1 a.m., so bring 
your dancing shoes and your date!
To get there: Hop on any 61 or 71 headed inbound and 
then walk when you get there. You never know what 
you’ll stumble upon Downtown!
East Liberty
Vibe: An up-and-coming neighborhood, almost like a 
mineral: a little rough outside, but some real gems lie 
inside if you take the time to look.
Best eats: The pan-Asian fusion at 
Plum is the winner for East 
Liberty. Hands down 
the classiest 
pan-Asian 
in Pittsburgh, Plum 
presents not only a beautiful, tasty 
plate, but a fun, modern space in which to 
enjoy it with family and friends. Be sure to try 
the pad thai and the sushi.
Favorite attraction: All the shopping. In recent 
years, the city has put a lot of money and effort into the 
gentri?cation of this area, leading to the development of 
plenty of stores and shops. From Giant Eagle to Trader 
Joe’s to Anthropologie, check out Bakery Square and 
more in East Liberty.
To get there: Take the 71B from Fifth and Morewood 
avenues to South Highland Avenue and Station Street.
Shadyside
Vibe: A slightly upscale, clean neighborhood with 
fashionable shops.
Best eats: For a nice evening out, head to Girasole, 
a fabulous Italian restaurant with a classy vibe. For a 
mouth-watering burger, check out Stack’d, a burger joint 
where you build your own burger 
from the bun up. If you’re a big 
sushi fan, then hit up Umi. 
Right on Ellsworth Avenue, 
this restaurant is 
known for its fresh, 
delicious sushi.
Best attraction: Walnut Street is a great place to spend 
an afternoon or evening. Browse some of the shops 
— including an Apple Store, Banana Republic, and 
American Apparel — grab a coffee and some ice cream, 
and take a nice, leisurely stroll.
To get there: Hop on any of the outbound 71 buses 
from Fifth and Morewood avenues. It’s certainly within 
walking distance, however, and you can simply walk 
down Fifth Avenue and turn down South Aiken Avenue.
A beginner’s guide for exploring the City of Bridges
Gather your roommates and take a trip around Pittsburgh’s many neighborhoods and districts
Squirrel Hill
Vibe: A lower-cost, quirkier sibling of Shadyside.
Best eats: For the best pizza in all of Pittsburgh, head 
to Mineo’s Pizza House on Murray Avenue. Uncle 
Sam’s Sandwich Bar is also a great spot if you’re a 
cheesesteak kind of person. If you drink a lot of coffee— 
and even if you don’t, you will be soon — then check out 
Commonplace Roasters. Great teas, coffee, and friendly 
atmosphere abound.
Best attraction: The old-timey and intimate Squirrel 
Hill movie theater — the Manor Theatre — is the perfect 
place to check out a new movie in a building with a 
fantastically vintage vibe. It’s surrounded by just about 
every kind of restaurant you could dream of, so it’s easy 
to make a night of it.
To get there: Grab an outbound 61 from the corner of 
Morewood and Forbes avenues, then jump off at Forbes 
and Murray avenues (by the Rite-Aid). From there you 
can explore pretty much all of Squirrel Hill.
Oakland
Vibe: Pittsburgh’s collegiate center.
Best eats: If you love your pancakes piled 
high with butter and syrup, your bacon 
crispy-greasy, and your omelets full of 
?llings then you’ll be in heaven at Pamela’s 
on Forbes Avenue. When it 
comes to lunch, head over to Primanti 
Brothers for signature Pittsburgh cuisine: 
French fries on a sandwich. For dinner, come 
back toward Carnegie Mellon and dine at The 
Porch at Schenley Plaza. It’s got a hip, yet mature 
atmosphere, and accepts Plaid Cash.
Best attraction: Possibly one of the greatest — and 
often underutilized — resources is the museum complex 
on Forbes Avenue, at the end of South Craig Street. The 
Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History are not to 
be missed. They’re both free with your student ID and 
packed with interesting and thought-provoking material. 
Best of all, you don’t even need a bus to get there.
To get there: Hop on either an inbound 61 from 
Forbes and Morewood avenues or an inbound 71 from 
Morewood and Fifth avenues. Or just walk — it’s 
practically in your backyard.
South Side
Vibe: A shopping center, nightlife destination, and 
restaurant hotspot.
Best eats: If you have a big group, de?nitely hit up Buca 
di Beppo. This almost cheesy Italian restaurant serves 
great food family style, meaning large servings in big 
bowls to pass and share around the table. They’ll have 
to roll you out after eating so much pasta. For a truly 
hilarious dining experience, ask to sit in the Pope room, 
where a bust of the Pope watches you eat. Another great 
?nd in the South Side is Nadine’s, near the SouthSide 
Works cinema. Their fried bologna sandwich is as good 
as it sounds.
Best attraction: SouthSide Works is a must-see for 
anyone who is going to call Pittsburgh home for the 
next four years. Head there for the Cheesecake Factory, 
trendy shopping, beautiful fountains and gardens, and a 
short walk to the river’s edge.
To get there: Head down to South Craig Street and 
catch the 54 from in front of Bagel Factory. Take that to 
East Carson and South 22nd streets in South Side. From 
there, just walk east on East Carson Street until you get 
to South 27th Street. From there, you should be able to 
see SouthSide Works!

be persuaded into something daring. You might just learn 
something new!

unanswered questions. Everyone is learning around you, 
too, so don’t be afraid to speak up.

Talk to your secret crush. A new year means new 
relationships, whether it be new friends or finally hanging 
out with that amazing guy/ girl from class.

schedule from the beginning than to try to start one halfway 
through the school year.
virgo
aug. 23–sept. 22
Be mindful of deadlines. Don’t forget any important dates 
for loans, expenses, health insurance, etc. They can come 
back and bite you if they slip your mind.

things here as a student. Keep that card handy and close!

Take on a job. The start of the school year means great 
opportunity for job openings around the campus, and it 
never hurts to have a little extra cash.
