TEN CENTSVOL. II, No. 19®avtan
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1908
THE NEW ATHLETIC FIELD
Our athletic field has now been definitely ar­
ranged for. The understanding is that the grounds 
will be ready for the school’s use on or before the 
first of May. Arrangements have, in fact, been made 
for a game during the first week in May. Our old 
practice field will be sufficient until that time. These 
grounds will enable Tech. to play more home games 
than before and we will not be dependent on the 
good-will of another school for an opportunity to 
do so. With the various, teams playing at home 
during part of their schedule, there undoubtedly 
will be more interest manifested in their success 
than has been the case in the past. The base ball 
team will be seen at home first and it will certainly 
draw the major portion of the student body to its 
opening game, especially in view of the very success­
ful season it enjoyed last year. Whether a track 
meet can be arranged or not we are unable to say; 
but we are hopeful that Captain Dowling and his 
men may be seen here at least in a dual meet.
Manager Thomson, of the foot-ball team, has 
negotiations on foot for games at home with W. 
and J., Case, and probably Bucknell or Mt. Union. 
Our one foot-ball game at home last season demon­
strated the way the students will turn out for a 
foot-ball game and with a constantly improving team, 
and the knowledge that the game is on our own 
ground the interest will undoubtedly be increased.
While we cannot expect to have our athletic 
association entirely self-supporting for the next few 
years, its financial condition will undoubtedly im­
prove after the coming season. The one foot-ball 
game spoken of above not only paid for itself, but
almost cleared the deficit incurred in the rest of the 
season’s games. With such drawing cards as W. 
and J., and Case, the foot-ball team will no doubt 
be self-supporting, that is, it will be able to at least 
pay for its own suits, expenses and wages for its 
coach. We see no reason why the base-ball team 
can not do as well if sufficient home games can be 
secured and Manager Colmery has been busily at 
work arranging them since he received definite in­
formation as to the date when the grounds would 
be available! Now that this temporary arrange­
ment has been made the matter of permanent 
grounds should not be dropped, but on the contrary, 
should be pushed with renewed vigor. If the in­
creased student contribution has carried in all the 
schools, as it undoubtedly will if it has not already, 
there will be more than enough money available 
to lease the grounds and we are of the opinion 
that whatever amount is left over should be placed 
in fund for grading and laying out our stadium. 
It would be a paying proposition to get this started 
as once it is completed student contributions can 
be reduced if not abolished altogether. Very prob­
ably they could be limited to season tickets or some 
such form of contribution.
Then let everybody pull together for two things; 
a start on permanent grounds, a full attendance 
and plenty of enthusiasm at the home games on 
the grounds already secured.

THE TARTAN
I SCHOOL OF APPLIED DESIGN S 
§ NIGHT |
Raymond J. Rodgers, Editor.
One of the brightest sons of the Tartan appears 
on the horizon with this issue. The night school of 
Applied Design has become a permanent, organized 
body, and from hence onward is determined to take 
its just place among the foremost of every student 
undertaking.
Though we have but seventy-six students in the 
entire department (all classes) and with conditions 
in a very chaotic state, we have been remarkably 
well represented on all the ‘Varsity Athletic teams, 
as well as the Glee and Instrumental Clubs of the 
¡Schools, the fact that three of the four members 
comprising the club quartette for 1908 are students 
from this department is but one laudable instance, 
and there are others too numerous to mention here.
We, too, are the first cla3s to have the distinction 
and highly appreciated presence of our director at 
our annual spread, when he in one of his ever-ready, 
illustrious speeches declared he heartily enjoyed 
every moment of the occasion, that he was proud 
to be our honor guest and that he rejoiced in the 
knowledge that such a body of students was identi­
fied with the grand and noble institution of which 
he is the head.
The above tends to prove this department must 
be reckoned with in the future, that we are not slow 
nor sleeping, that the spirit which has in the past 
lain somewhat dormant is now burst forth into the 
most brilliant and commendable of all the sons of 
our dear C. T. S.
Brandy Smith, the exponent of strenous arts and 
games, as well as beautifully colored posters, dis­
coursed to a bunch of the boys the other evening 
on the benefits of Golf. Brandy has some good 
sticks for sale.
There were turned in, January 19th, for judg­
ment by the Society of Beaux Arts the largest num­
ber of projects in the history of the School of Ap­
plied Design.
King finally succeeded in getting his class A 
chirette (King can say it properly) off on a special 
to New York, January 26.
Buxton is determined to have this year’s Patron’s 
Dinner eclipse all others. Keep the good work 
going, Buxton; it’s a noble cause.
A temporary representative on the athletic com­
mittee was chosen at the meeting of the Atelier 
last Tuesday in the person of Raymond J. Rodgers. 
“Get Busy Rodgers,” says King.
Some of the boys would like to know if Dornber- 
ger, of the hockey team, still has that Rensselaer 
streamer.
The juniors to a man in this department have 
signified their intention to be at the “Junior Prom.”

1 PLEBES |
The fact that most of the fellows are compelled 
to stay indoors during odd moments on account of 
the inclement weather, has brought a peculiar thing 
about the schools to the surface. Being dismissed 
a little early before the noon hour, three of the class 
had about an hour to wait until the next period. 
For a while they were content to watch the Indus­
trials play horse in the lower corridor, then out 
came pipes and books, likewise Trigonometry prob­
lems. The Library was full and the Commons 
noisy, they couldn’t study on the stairs, and a class 
occupied the Foundry. At last one little truck was 
discovered near the store room, and promptly occu­
pied by the three. In about ten minutes His Hon­
orable Lordship, the Director of the Mop Brigade 
appeared on the scene. Long and loud were his 
protests; who ever heard of trucks being used to 
sit on; that was not what they were made for. The 
three patiently waited for the eruption to subside, 
and then very calmly told hiis nibbs just exactly 
where he could go, and what he could do after he 
got there. This, of course, brought forth another 
volley of stormy remarks that were as vigorously 
answered. But soon he left, to look for trouble in 
other regions.
Please, good Mr. Director, can’t we have a few 
benches in the corridors, especially the lower one, 
to sit on? It might bring about a little more of the 
“common meeting ground” idea, and could hardly 
be productive of any great harm. /
We regret that at the prasent writing, we are 
unable to obtain any very definite information about 
the condition of “Red” Wilson, who has been sick 
for some time. We wish him the speediest recov­
ery possible, and hope to see him with us again soon, 
for he has been very much missed.

HOW THE TRIBE OF CHONG FEN WAS FOUNDED
In the beginning, when the world was still young, 
there dwelt along the valley of the Nile none but 
the wild animals, who roamed around and were free 
to go where they pleased. For some years they 
lived in peace and harmony, but after a while con­
fusion and strife arose and the Gods saw they need­
ed a master; so they chose from among themselves 
a lesser God, Chong Fen, to descend to earth, and 
become a man and rule over the wild creatures.
Chong Fen took for his dwelling place a large 
cave high up on one of the hills overlooking the 
Nile, and there he dwelt for many years. No one 
disturbed his peace for he was the first and only 
man; nor dared any of the animals disobey him in 
that he was part God.
But, a s the world became older, the animals 
became greater in number and the Gods saw that 
there should be more than one man on earth, so 
they sent to Chong Fen the desire or longing for 
championship. This longing became so great that 
he was no longer content to dwell in his cave alone, 
and live as the Gods had thought it best for a man 
to live. He wanted to go out and from the hills to 
explore and see what new things the Gods had sent 
to the wild creatures.•,rWt ’-He wandered for many days up and down jllie 
sandy banks of the sluggish river, never resting, yet 
never weary, for he could think of nothing but Iwg 
great desire. Now it so happened that one morn­
ing, just as the great Sun God was coming up over 
the -eastern hills, Chong Fen was startled by the 
sound of laughter. Ever since he had become a
man he had heard only the sounds of the shifting 
sands, of the running waters, of the wind' in the 
tree tops, and the calls of the wild creatures and 
the birds. He listened, and upon hearing the sounds 
repeated, moved quietly and swiftly along the river 
bank in the direction from which it came. Soon 
he came to a quiet little inlet of the river, bordered 
by ferns and palms, and there, before him, playing 
in the water, were two of the most beautiful crea­
tures he had ever seen. They were part maiden 
and part crocodile; their heads and arms resembling 
those of some beautiful Goddess, and the lower part 
of their bodies bein glike the tail of a crocodile. 
They were the twin daughters of the River God.
No sooner did he see them than he made up his 
mind to capture them. This was no t an easy thing 
to do, for he could not swim and he dared not make 
any noise for fear of frightening them away. He 
saw that there was no way of getting them unless 
they would come up out of the water, on to the dry 
bank where he could lay a spell over them. He 
waited for three days, and on the third day was re­
warded, for about sunset the two beautiful sisters 
became weary and came out of the water an d lay 
down on the bank to sleep. No sooner had they 
fallen asleep than Chong Fen slipped quietly out of 
his hiding place and, picking them both up, carried 
them off to his cave.
As soon as the God of the River Nile found out 
what Chong Fen had done he hastened after him, 
to get his daughters back, but Chong Fen, knowing 
that he would be pursued, was ready for the River 
God. There was a mighty combat in front of the 
cave in which Chong Fen was victorious and the 
River God driven back to the Nile.
For a long time, Chong Fen kept the mermaids 
prisoners in his cave, but one day, while he was out 
hunting for food, one of the sisters broke her bonds 
and escaped to the river and was never seen by 
Chong Fen again. The other sister, Chong Fen 
married and they lived happily together for many 
years.
They had seven children, the oldest being a 
boy;. and, when these children were old enough, 
they went out from the cave and down to the banks 
of the Nile. There they settled, and forming the 
first tribe, the oldest'called himself Chief and ruled 
over the others.
For many years they lived in harmony together, 
but, as the tribe grew larger and larger, the Chief 
saw that they would need another man to serve 
them; so he mated certain of the wild animals, and 
their children because' men. These were known as 
the common men or people, and were hiled over by 
the higher men of th,e .tribe, or the descendants of 
Chong Fen and his children. And this'ls true even 
to the present day. ‘i*
And it is true to-day as well, that if a man goes 
too near a crocodile in the River Nile he will be 
snatched up and eaten, but this is as it should be, 
for it is only the other beautiful sister taking her 
sacrifice.

J. H. Taxis, Editor.
Taylor of 3-C, was married on January 28. The 
valuable points obtained from 1911 in the debate at 
the recent smoker influenced him to such an extent 
that his change from bachelorhood to wedded bliss 
quickly followed.
The combined Musical Clubs rendered a very 
successful concert on Thursday evening, January 
30, at the open meeting of the Men’s Club of the 
Knoxville Presbyterian Church.
The inactivity in athletics of the 1910 class has 
been freely commented on by the two lower classes, 
and an answer thereto will not be out of place at 
this time. There are some very good reasons for 
this apparent neglect; the one which we think is 
the best will be given: Four nights close attention 
to classes until 10.30, entailing a large amount of 
outside preparation leaves little or no time for the 
indulgence, as a class, in student athletics. 1910 
has striven to maintain the high standard of Tech. 
as a school of learning, especially as regards the 
night clases and as to how well we have succeeded, 
one need only ask any of the instructors who have 
been with us; the one expression is common to all: 
“I am proud of you.” This record is one of which
1910 is prouder than if a name had been made in 
athletics. Don't any class think 1910 is a “dead one” 
for its strength lies not in shouting its greatness 
in the corridors or on the bulletin boards, but in 
making a record in the class room that all following 
classes will have to work to their limits to equal.
After the concert on Thursday evening some of 
the boys of the clubs held an informal banquet at 
the Cafe Fulton and each one present expressed 
his delight in attending. These gatherings greatly 
enhance the social side of the organization, go a 
great way towards keeping the boys together and 
help to compensate for the sacrifices made on each 
one’s time in preparation.

Professor F. E. Foss, A.M., B.S., is a native of 
Lewiston, Me. He received his early education at 
that place, graduating from the city high school, 
later going to Bates College, where he took his first 
degree in 1883, afterward entering the Massachu­
setts Institute of Technology, graduating with the 
class of 1886. The call of the west country was 
strong to him and immediately upon receiving his 
science degree, he answered the call. He remained 
in that section of the country for several years en­
gaged in railroad work, and in 1891 accepted the 
post of instructor in Civil Engineering at the Massa­
chusetts Tech. He remained in the east for two 
years and was then offered the chair of Civil En­
gineering at Penn State College for one year and 
during that period received the appointment to the 
chair of Civil Engineering at the Carnegie Technical 
, Schools.
In the short time since his arrival at Tech, Prof. 
Foss has attained a deal of popularity with the stu­
dent body in general, and his personality has little 
less than a magic effect upon that band of desper­
adoes, the Civils, with whom he comes—in most in­
timate contact. Not that he rules with an iron 
hand, oh; mercy, no! but his quiet, observant man­
ner bespeaks the covered fire that needs only the 
fanning of the breeze to burst into a conflagration. 
An awful silence pervades the Civil drawing rooms 
immediately upon his entry. Not even a gentle 
zephyr breaks the calm, but when he of the mystic 
manner is far away, the wind howls and tempestuous 
seas rise mountain high.
Close upon his arrival at the schools he was 
hunted by “powers that be” o take a position on 
one of those faculty committees having names that 
cost, for they are so long that the stenographers 
have to be paid supper money upon each occasion
they .have to be written. Briefly, his assignment was
to the Committee for the Regulation of the Student 
Organizations of the Carnegie Technical Schools. 
He has served thereon with efficiency, and we are 
told that the same mild mannered conservatism is 
in evidence there, as everywhere.

Walter Close, ’09, Chairman of the Junior Prom. 
Committee, reports that all is progressing favorably. 
The invitations are being printed and will soon be 
on sale. Preparations are being made for a large 
crowd.

TECH AND WUP TO CLASH ON THE ICE.
Unless the preparations fall through Wup will 
have a hockey team that will be a fast one. The 
Duquesne Garden management has been trying to 
induce Wup to get a fast team together for some 
time and consequently they will hold their first prac­
tice this evening after the skating session, when an 
opportunity may be had to size up the team. The 
game with Tech is scheduled for Thursday evening, 
Feb. 20th. This night permits a full attendance of 
Tech men, both day and night, and it is hoped that 
a good crowd will come out.
---------o---------
ADVICE TO CONTRIBUTORS.
Some little knocking has been noticed among the 
“copy” concerning the manner in which some short 
articles have -been spelled and printed in the Tartan. 
Where the “copy” is not legible enough mistakes » 
are bound to happen, and also remember that Greek 
letters and other odd characters are not a part of the 
English language, and are not to be found on the or­
dinary linotype machine. Where the meaning is 
not entirely clear the proof-reader has to supply 
words which seem to fit, or else cut out the article. 
Also, remember that neither the printer nor the 
proof reader of the Tartan is a dunce.

ALLEN HUGHES SOUTHARD,
1911, night A. S., died at the Columbia Hospital 
Sunday evening, Feb. 2, after a long siege of typhoid 
fever. He was born at Emlenton, Pa., Oct. 24, 1886, 
and at present his parents reside at Dorchester, 
Mass. Southard was a very popular man with his 
class-mates, and his loss will be keenly felt by all.

J. Le Roy Hoffman, Editor.
In response to my request for some news I 
received the following from Skeehan:
“Kiss a girl at sixteen and she will coo with de­
light.
“Kiss one at twenty and she will be ready to 
fight.
‘Kiss one at twenty-five and she will get sore.
“Kiss an old maid of forty and she will yell for 
more.”
Note:—Our marshall probably knows all about 
this from experience.
Mr. Keagy contributed this: “There was a cer­
tain young maiden of the East End, who very kindly 
undertook the task of teaching the Sunday-School 
lesson to a class of w^aifs in a down-town mission. 
One Sunday the lesson was upon the subject of being 
charitable, etc., and the young lads seemed rather 
thick-headed, failing to follow' her line of reasoning. 
After ten or fifteen minutes of explanation the fair 
young teacher asked the class a question. ¡She said: 
“Now, children, what is it I am doing when I come 
all the way down here to teach you how to be good, 
and grow up to be good and honorable men?” None 
of the coming men seemed willing to answer, so 
she asked the question again and added that she 
would give a pretty picture card to the little boy 
who could answer it, and displayed a card tempt­
ingly before them. This offer seemed to encourage 
them a little, for two grimy little hands shot into 
the air. ‘That’s it; I knew you could answer that 
simple, little question,” she said. “Now, Jamie, you 
can tell us. Stand up and tell us what I am doing.” 
“Buttin’ in,” little Jamie exclaimed.
Those fellows in “B” are certainly nervy. They 
locked Dr. McTaggart out of the room last Wednes­
day and kept him in the corridor fifteen minutes or 
so. The tables will be turned when they get an 
F in Chemistry at the end of the term.
Somebody stole Richard’s drawings while he was 
in Math the other evening. And the ungrateful 
wretch did not even thank the party-who returned 
them. Truly, “the more you do for some people, 
the more you may.”
That fellow Finch (C-l) should be in the Salva­
tion Army. -The manner by which he makes you 
open your pocket-book for the class fund is a wonder. 
Those lads and lasses of the blue uniform should 
take lessons from him. Good work, Finch. Pres­
ident Helm says that he will see that you get an 
extra pipeful of tobacco at the smoker.
Last Monday evening Prof. Hokanson told us 
of a splendid article on the strength of materials 
in the January number of Machinery, and suggested 
that we «look it up when we went home. Thank 
you, Mr. H., we carried your suggestion home with 
us and—then, forgot all about it. Guilty fellows?
B-1 in Materials.
Mr. H.—“That was very poor brick in that 
column. Poor brick, poor brick.”
Keagy (away in the rear)—“What is that, Prof., 
another parody on ‘Poor John?’”
C-1 in Math.
Mr. A.-—Where is your book, Richards? Haven’t 
you got one?”
Richards—“Yes,'I have one but it is too much 
like work to carry it.”
Mr. A.—“Well, then, it is too much like work 
to help you. You will have to bring your book 
after this.”
The regular monthly class meeting will be held 
in the General Assembly room Friday, Feb. 7, 1908, 
10.30 P. M.. All arrangements for the affair on the 
14th have been completed and all those who con­
tributed to the class fund owe it to themselves and 
the class to be on hand.
Congratulations, Mr. Typesetter. After careful 
scrutiny of our page in last week's Tartan I have 
failed to find a single instance of an “i” for an “r” 
or of an “h” for a “k.”
Riddle.
Why did McCowen and Weber rush off to the 
Gardens last Friday immediately after the first 
period? McCowen had a new pair of shoes, a new 
pair skates—and Weber had a date.
Possibly the solution of eleven’s difficulty in 
raising a quorum for a class meeting lies in the fact 
of there being so many of their good men in ’12 this 
year. They are all jolly fellows, too.

A. F. Stamm, Editor.
Mr. Doyle was elected to the honorary post of
Advisor in class of 1911. The duties connected with
this office were outlined in a recent issue of the 
Tartan.
On looking over the records one will notice
the marked partiality of ’11 for English teachers 
in the capacity of advisor. Last year Dr. R. H. 
Holbrook, who taught English in the night class, 
was our advisor and he will attend the banquet this

year as one of the boys. This coincidence may 
cause a smile to steal over the sphynx-like counten­
ances of some of our mummified rivals and we can 
already hear them say, “It is because you'se guys 
needs the gramar.”
Those of 1911 who have not received their in­
vitations for the banquet are, at the earnest solici­
tation of the committee not to feel that they are 
objects of any discrimination. The failure to re­
ceive the regularly printed invitation may be due 
•to change of address, carelessness in addressing 
envelope, or incorrect address published in the 1907-
OS catalogue, from which all the names were taken.
Those of 1910 who showed the real appreciation 
of merit by deserting the dead ones and allied them­
selves with the stellar aggregration of “liye- ones” 
will be interviewed by the committee and united 
formally. . - - > -
The committee wishes to state that the money 
for the banquet will be spent in the most judicious 
manner and that there will be just as many plates 
paid for as are used (if the number reaches a cer­
tain figure).
The only time that 1910, ’11 and ’12 can get 
along in perfect harmony is at Mandolin Club meet­
ings (if the “Ding-pots” are in tune).
Heard in B-2—“Mr. Howard, what is your idea 
in naming that angle ‘theta’? Why not give it a 
Christian name like ‘A’ or ‘B’ ?”
Howard—“G, it sounds more learned.”
Johnson of B-2—The silent member of the social 
committee approves of vwhat has been done for the 
banquet.
Mr. Stamm is greatly obliged for the advertise­
ment he received at the hands of .1910 in last week’s 
Tartan.
What was “The Terrible Secret” which made 
“The man, Munk——” laugh so heartily last Friday 
night? - - • - -
When McCulley answers roll-call (in electricity) 
his “mush-mouthed” utterance reminds one of “a 
perfumed breath borne on the wings of a gentle 
zephyr from some gorgeous bower of Paradise.” 
Speak up and say, “HERE!” like the rest of us.
Send, or hand in your postals for the banquet 
before the 12th in order that your place may be 
reserved. A new and original souvenir menu card 
'will 'be given "to alf guests sending in cards on time.
A lesson which 1911 seems- to have forgotten 
may be repeated in the - following words: “Don’t 
talk during a lecture as your class mates may want 
to hear the teacher.” . .

12THE TARTAN
INDUSTRIALS.
The first annual banquet of the Day Industrial 
Class of 1909 was held at the Nixon Cafe last Thurs­
day evening and was a pronounced success. After 
eight sumptuous courses the assembly lighted their 
cigars and settled back in their chairs to listen to 
some of the best toasts ever heard at a Carnegie 
Tech banquet. Mr. C. B. Connelly, head of the 
Schools of Apprentices and Journeymen, presided 
as toastmaster, and after a few well chosen and hu­
morous remarks, introduced President Young of the 
Class, who responded to a toast, “Our Class.” Mr.
B. E. Birge next responded to “English as She is 
Spoke,” which, of course, ended with an interesting 
fish story told with a cleaner Indian dialect. Mr. 
H. A. Calderwood responding to “Short Circuits,” 
told in a humorous way some of his early experiences 
in the business world, “hunting that box of short 
circuits, etc.,” cleverly adding an exceptionally 
laughable story or witty remark at every opportunity. 
Mr. J. T. Morris, whose sense of humor and ready 
wit need little comment, responded in his usual strain 
to ‘ Simultaneous equations.” Our S. 0. C. champion, 
Mr. W. Pfouts, responding to “Some of Us (and 
Others),” was the cause of several hilarious out­
bursts. Mr. R. B. Leighou, who responded to “Chem­
ical Changes,” told of some of his changes during 
an initiation, at which time he scrambled like an 
egg, developed like a film, and from the top of a 
tree—-Well, he sure was rewarded. Mr. Hamilton, 
who responded to “The Machinists,” told us among 
other interesting things of two little machinists. 
Mr. C. C. Leeds, responding to “Athletics,” remind­
ed us of the important place we fill on the ’Varsity 
Eleven, our duty to ourselves, our teachers, and our 
school in the athletic line. Mr. Day, in answer to 
a request to explain Mr. Connelly’s expression, “Day 
by Night,” good-naturedly told us all about the girl 
and Mr. Brown, in his characteristic manner so well 
pleasing to the student body, told us something about 
the workings of the mind of a modern Sherlock 
Holmes. _ . .
A few students were embarrassed by demands 
for explanations. Messrs. Crissman and Heinze 
were asked to explain about,the catch-as-catch-can 
championship of Wall Street. McTighe was asked 
to tell about that pull with the registrar, and Flynn 
was called upon to enlighten us as to the origin of 
that delectable nickname “Feathers.”
After two toasts to the Faculty, proposed by 
Rogers and French, a roof-raising Alma Mater was 
sung -by the entire assemblage.
Feighly at class meeting—“Why not elect Mr. 
—— Spiritual Director? We are Under the impres­
sion that Feig could have used one to good advan­
tage Wednesday and Thursday.”
Laily (discussing the gender of a machine) — 
“Professor, I think it should be called she, its so 
easily handled, you know.” Say, fellows, let’s take 
him out some night.

MANAGER STEEN MAKES REPORT.
On Friday night, January 10, College basket-ball 
received the most enthusiastic welcome it has ever 
received in Pittsburg. The games between Tech 
and Wup in this line of sport have ever been most 
bitterly contested and this year, as shown by the 
first game of the series, will be no exception to the 
rule. The first game was altogether a great suc­
cess, for Tech had the largest crowd she ever turned 
out and the fastest team. Although Tech lost we feel 
not a bit discouraged, because up to the last blow 
of the whistle almost, it was anybody’s game, and 
the crowd were continually on their feet as first 
one side and 'then the other forged ahead. As far 
as finances are concerned it is to be understood from 
the start that this year basket-ball is to be self-sup­
porting, and to this aim the management is doing 
its best by issuing season tickets within the reach 
of rll. The financial report to date follows:
55 season tickets at 75c.................................$41 25
101 single admission tickets at 25c*........... 25 25
Half net receipts ................................................... 2 05
Total in treasury ...............................$43 30
*First Wup game.
In order to be self-supporting it is estimated 
that Tech will have to make $25 dollars on each of 
the following games. The season tickets will 
from now on be 60c. No further reduction will be 
made. They can be procured at the store room, 
single tickets will be on sale a week before each 
game. The schedule, which is not yet complete, is 
as follows:
Jan. 10—W. U. P. at Duquesne Garden.
Jan. 16—Geneva at Beaver Falls.
Jan 25—
Feb. 1—Sewickley Y. M. C. A. at Sewickley.

TECH VICTORIOUS AT BASKET-BALL,
The. Carnegie Tech Basket-Ball Team won a 
very close and exciting game from Sewickley Y. M. 
C. : A. at Sewrickley on Saturday night. The team, 
although a bit crippled, played a magnificent game, 
winning by a- score- of 36 to 33, and when considered 
that Sewickley beat Geneva it makes our defeat by 
that college less important. Every man played well, 
and it would be unfair and unjust to pick any man 
Out for especial mention. On account -of the ab­
sence of both Harrison and Davis, Lytle -played for­
ward and Agnew guard.
Friday night Tech clashes writh Westminster, 
and it is the duty of every Tech man who possibly 
can, to be there. Westminster has a strong team 
and a fast game is" expected. Tickets for this game 
can be secured at the store room, as can season 
tickets also.
CRUCIBLE CLUB.
Mr. Henry Berger, F. R. M. S., an astronomer 
and expert microscopist, will lecture before the

has aroused the curiosity of the entire organization 
by his contentions and a large audience will doubt­
less be present , at his demonstration.

THE TARTAN15
Five lower classmen in the University of Penn­
sylvania are'in the university hospital, and four more 
are under arrest as the result of a riot which took 
place last week on the occasion of th^ annual fresh­
man dinner at Kugler’s restaurant, which the soph­
omores attempted to break up.
More than 400 students were engaged in the 
free-for-all fight, fully half of whom came off with cut 
heads or bruised bodies, while nearly $1,000 worth of 
glassware and china was demolished. The interior 
of the big banquet room was completely wrecked, 
electroilers broken, furniture was smashed and cur­
tains and tapestries torn into shreds.
The cause of this Considerable disturbance was 
nothing more nor less than a trifling matter of 
“gcod-natured class rivalry.” There had been an 
all-day fight between the freshmen and sophomores, 
which started, in fact, at the Charity Ball on Wed­
nesday night, when a band of second-year men, 
equipped with an automobile, had attempted to kid­
nap Roland Hunter, chairman of the banquet com­
mittee. Hunter learned of the proposed capture and 
escaped through the stage door of the Academy of 
Music, thus eluding his pursuers.

colleges and universities, to be gone for about two 
weeks. Practically all the prominent engineering 
schools of the country will be visited, particular at­
tention will be paid to Carnegie Tech, Purdue, Mas­
sachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell, Michi­
gan and Illinois.$ $ * $
The recent revelation of the fact that Miss Eli­
zabeth Cook is to be one of the representatives on 
the Cornell team against Columbia in the intercolle­
giate debate on February 28 has caused much com­
ment in the New York dailfes. Woodbury, president 
of the Debating Union at Columbia, and secretary of 
the Inter-collegiate Triangular league—Columbia, 
Cornell and Pennsylvania—has entered a protest, the 
Union approving of his action. Cornell and Penn­
sylvania have not yet replied to the protest.
^ ¦
President Van Hise of • the University of Wis­
consin has announced the appointment of Thomas 
Barry as coach of the foot-ball and base-ball teams 
and instructor of athletics on the faculty. Barry 
was one of the greatest halfbacks that ever played 
for Brown University. He was afterward coach 
of Notre Dame.- ^ ^
The Cornell Co-operative society, conducting a 
student’s store, has declared a dividend of 8 per cent, 
on last year’s business. Hereafter not only members 
of the society, but all university purchasers will 
share in the profits.
