Students Insured Deferment 
By 1951 Draft Amendments
Deferment Until Finish Of School Term
Guaranteed If Call Comes During Year
Selective Service has announced that it will not make any special 
provisions to give students 30 days after the end of their academic 
year to enlist in the service of their choice. The 1951 amendments 
provide that students are henceforth to be deferred instead of hav­
ing their induction postponed. * '
The Selective Service Act of | his local board official notice that 
1948 provided that any student I he is a full-time student doing
who was ordered for induction 
could have his induction post­
poned until the end of his aca­
demic year when he became liable 
for immediate induction. The 1951 
amendments have changed this to 
provide that the student ordered 
for induction, if he had never been 
deferred as a student before, can 
be deferred in Class I-S until the 
end of his academic year, but he 
can receive only one such defer­
ment.
See School Quickly
A student who is entitled to a 
Statutory I-S deferment must be 
ordered - for induction before he 
can be deferred by his local board. 
A student who is ordered for in­
duction should request the Dean 
or Registrar to immediately give
Increased Costs 
Force Elimination 
Of Social Dept.
Due to increased costs, Carne­
gie Tech’s department of social 
work, including the graduate pro­
gram, will be discontinued, effec­
tive June 30, 1953. No new stu­
dents will be admitted to the de­
partment’s two year program lead­
ing to the master’s degree in so­
cial work.
Students in the undergraduate 
program will be able to transfer 
without loss of credit to the social 
studies option in the department 
of general studies.
In explaining the higher cost. 
Dr. Warner said, “The main ex­
pense involved is in the correla­
tion of field instruction and class 
work for the individual student.”
The contracts of those faculty 
members with limited tenure will

satisfactory work and that such 
work commenced prior to the date 
the order for induction was mailed. 
Actual attendance at classes is 
the prerequisite.
Each student is obligated to 
keep his local board advised of 
his current status. Each student 
should have his school send offi­
cial notice to the local board as 
soon as the student has been noti­
fied that he has passed his pre­
induction physical examination. A 
student who is classified I-A may 
appeal to the State Appeal Board 
within 10 days from the date the 
local board mails the notice.
Still Make Choice
A student who receives a I-S 
deferment for one year is eligible 
for a II-S deferment the follow­
ing year if he takes the Selective 
Service College Qualification Test 
and makes a score of 70 or better 
or if he is in the prescribed upper 
portion of his class. The April 
Selective Service Test will be 
given soon and all male students 
are advised to take it regardless 
of their ROTC affiliation. The 
deadline for acquiring application 
blanks is March 10, and they can 
be obtained at the draft board of­
fice.
It is probable that any student 
desiring to enlist in June will have 
ample opportunity to enlist in the 
service of his choice.
Musician ?
The Kiltie Band is looking 
for a few more instruments 
to round out its spring concert 
instrumentation. If you play 
an instrument and are inter­
ested, see Mr. Schaefer at re­
hearsal Friday, at 4:30, in Ex­
hibition Hall, Fine Arts.
Draft Exam
Any Selective Service reg­
istrant who plans to continue 
next year as a full-time col­
lege student either at Carne­
gie or elsewhere, and who has 
not previously taken a Selec­
tive Service College Qualifica­
tion Test, should apply for the 
test which is to be given on 
April 24. The last date to ap­
ply for the April test is March 
10. All students concerned, in­
cluding those who now have 
1-D deferments, are urged to 
apply for the test. Applica­
tion forms are available at 
any Selective Service Board.
If there is any question as 
to whether this notice applies 
to you, go to the office of Dean 
Jones, AH 254-C.
Kiltie Symphonic Band
Presents Concert This Friday
Friday’s Kiltie Concert 
Has Varied Program
Carnegie’s Kiltie Band will open its 1952 concert season Feb­
ruary 15, with its Winter Concert in Carnegie Music Hall. The con­
cert band, directed by Mr. William A. Schaefer, is 90 men strong 
this year. ?
SC Election 
Vote Heavy; 
H&SS Tied
The results of last Wednesday’s 
elections for Student Council are 
as follows:
Elected from MMCC were Carol 
Agnew, Edith Engel, and Mary 
Lou Maurhoff.
From FA — Dorothy Malone, 
Norma Trust, and Sorlee Gefsky.
From H&SS—Don Hand.
From E&S—Bill Stewart, Dick 
Woods, Jim Lechner, Ray Sebul- 
sky, George Farneth, and Dick 
Durstine.
Assistant secretary — Nancy 
Rausch.
The H&SS balloting resulted in 
a tie, which was decided by the 
flip of a coin, both candidates be­
ing present at the time.
Council elections chairman 
Bruce Padolf reports that the vot­
ing at the election was heavier 
than has been the custom for some 
time, a total of 600 ballots being 
cast.
There is some agitation that this 
election, like the last, be invalidat­
ed on the grounds that improper 
identification was used in deter­
mining voting eligibility. (See let­
ter, page 2).
The evening will open with the 
traditional procession of the pip­
ers, led by Head Piper Bill Flick. 
The program is quite varied this 
concert, varying from Tschaikow- 
sky’s sombre “Finale from Sym­
phony V” to Kern’s sparkling 
“Showboat” medley.
Mood Shifts
Leading the program will be 
the “French National Defile” 
March, Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Over­
ture to The Maid of Pskov,” and 
Handle’s well known “Water Mu­
sic” Suite. Then the mood will 
change to the fast dance rythms 
of Latin America as the band plays 
Gould’s “Guaracha.” In a quieter 
mood, Wood’s dreamy “Manx 
Overture” will be presented, and 
then the concert march “My 
Hero,” based on the melody by 
Oscar Strauss.
Following intermission, the sec­
ond half of the concert will con­
fine with the triumphal “March 
and Procession of Bacchus” by 
Delibes, Copeland’s “Outdoor Ov­
erture,” and Ravel’s “Pavanne.” 
“Showboat,” Tschaikowsky’s “Fi­
nale” and Sousa’s “Sabre and
CIT Records
The Kiltie Band is offering 
the album “Songs of Carnegie 
Tech” at a greatly reduced 
price in the bookstore. The 
new price, $3.98, is only thir­
teen cents above the original 
price when the album was re­
corded two years ago, inspite 
of increased cost of the al­
bums to the band.
Seniors To Interview 
Regardless Of Draft

ARCHITECTS WIN AWARDS
It was a happy occasion when J. Paul Scheetz, right, vice presi­
dent of the Rust engineering company, presented prize awards in the 
fifth annual Rust architectural awards project for Carnegie Tech 
students of architecture. Prize winners left to right are, Don L. 
arrett, William S. Childs, and Charles W. McCurdy, who has just 
eceived his $100 first prize award. The three winners, whose designs 
©f furniture factories were termed exceptional, were further honored 
by the company at a Duquesne Club luncheon after the presentation.
of impending service with the 
armed forces are making a serious 
mistake, according to Wangeman. 
Many of the companies planning 
to visit the campus this spring 
have made assurances that draft 
or reserve status will not be a 
factor in employing* graduating 
engineers. Below are direct quo­
tations taken from letters from 
several of these companies:
General Electric Company—“It 
is highly desirable that the boys, 
even though they are sure they 
are going into military service, 
to develop their contacts with in­
dustry while they are still on the 
campus. They may be assured 
that upon their release from serv­
ice they will be needed just as 
badly as they are needed now,
and by taking a little time to go 
through the interviewing proce­
dure they will find that contacts 
already established are easier to 
continue and their eventual 
placement in industry will be a 
great deal easier than if they have 
to start from scratch.”
Carbide and Chemicals Divi­
sion—“We did not last year, and 
will not this year, discriminate in 
any way against any student who 
is vulnerable either from a draft 
standpoint or is likely to be called 
into the reserves. As a matter of 
fact, last year we employed two 
men who were reserve officers, 
knowing that they would not be 
able to begin their employment

The concert will begin at 8:15 at 
Carnegie Hall. Tickets are sev­
enty five cents, and may be ob­
tained at the box office or by see­

partment.
Mr. Schaefer, director of the 
Kiltie Band, has been working ov­
ertime this past year. The march­
ing band was the featured attrac­
tion at the 1951 New Kensington 
Band Festival in October. At 
Bethany last November, he was 
the guest conductor at the Tri-

Sororitv Rush 
Begins Sunday
Open Houses Planned; 
Invitations Come Later
Formal rushing for sororities 
will open with the Panhellenic 
Open House, scheduled for Feb­
ruary 16 and 17, between 1 and 
1:30 p.m. As usual, the sororities 
will hold their open houses in var­
ious fraternity houses.
All women interested in joining 
a sorority will meet in Carnegie 
Union. Groups will be formed, and 
at 1:30 p.m., each group will be es­
corted to a Fraternity house by 
two Panhellenic representatives. 
At the end of each time period the 
groups will move to another fra­
ternity house until all fraternity 
houses are visited.
The purpose of the open houses 
is to enable non-sorority women 
to become better acquainted with 
the members of the seven sorori­
ties at Carnegie. It is extremely 
important to attend the open 
houses on both days in order to 
meet all the sororities. Each soror­
ity then extends invitations to its 
rushing event. The schedule for 
these functions is as follows: 
Thursday, February 21—KAT 
Friday, February 22—KKG 
Sunday, February 24—Tri Delt 
Thursday, February 28—Chi O 
Friday, February 29—A E Pht,

Editorial—
Only Temporary?
The first thing noticeable about that venerable Carne­
gie institution known as the barracks is not the barracks 
themselves, but the large, deep holes surrounding them 
which threaten the springs of every vehicle traveling more 
than three miles per hour. And once this initial contact is 
past, there are other shocks awaiting inside which cannot 
be avoided at all.
An essential requirement of a college dorm is that there 
be adequate protection from fire—and the barracks are any­
thing but fireproof. The wood and lathing construction would 
go up in a flash. And if a fire did develop there are those 
wonderfully contrived fire escapes at the end of each second 
floor corridor, consisting of wooden ladders nailed flush 
against the sides of the building. The alternative is to jump 
—that is if the windows will open.
Study conditions are also, of necessity, important in a col­
lege dormitory. This year has seen a great improvement in 
these conditions, through the efforts of vigorous dorm leader­
ship, but the past record shows that the thin walls and floors are 
anything but conducive to good study habits. Couple these con­
ditions with drafty heating, spotty plumbing, and a general bar­
ren atmosphere and the picture is not pleasant.
The barracks were built by the armed forces during the 
war, strictly as a temporary housing measure. After this 
period, when the school took over their operation complete­
ly, city departments responsible for the inspection and ap­
proval of dormitory-type housing took a tongue-in-cheek 
attitude toward the whole business, for though they made it 
clear that the barracks did not meet city requirements, they 
allowed that a state of emergency still existed and that the 
barrack’s continued existence could consequently be justi­
fied.
However, this ruling was made with the understanding 
that at least one wing of the barracks would be torn down 
and replaced each year, a practice which was followed for 
the first year and then abandoned. It is high time that some 
definite program of action is taken to tear down these “tem­
porary” structures and replace them with modern, fire­
proof dorms—fully aware, of course, of the many financial 
problems involved.
Here is the cateh—money. Why, argues the school, should 
new buildings be started now when high prices and uncertain­
ties about the future make this impractical? This is certainly 
a consideration, but does the school have any assurance that 
financial conditions in the foreseeable future are going to be 
any more conducive to new construction? The need is for better 
housing now, not ten years from now.
The barracks do not stand alone in the need for im­
provements—Scobell and Englebrecht Halls are not exactly 
worldbeaters in many respects. Also, in planning for new 
housing, the administration should not forget another ‘tem­
porary’ measure which threatens to become standard prac­
tice—the policy of doubling—and tripling-up many of the 
dorm rooms to provide needed space. It seems apparent that 
a close study of the whole campus housing situation is nec­
essary.

“. . . but a walking shadow, a

That struts and frets his hour

And then is heard no more.
It is a tale 
Told by an idiot, full of sound 
and fury,
Signifying nothing.”

H. Justin Davidson:
Is Council now so much of a 
totalitarian body that a referen­
dum petition, containing the 150 
signatures of full-time day stu­
dents required by the constitution, 
gets not even so much as a word 
in passing after the three-week 
leeway allowed by that same con­
stitution? Or hasn’t Council seen 
the petition; are we really operat­
ing under a dictatorship?
While I’m at it, I should like to 
take this opportunity to advise you 
that it -might be a good idea to 
call even the most recent Council 
election invalid since, due to lack 
of proper identification, it was pos­
sible for engineers to elect repre­
sentatives in the school of Fine 
Arts and vice-versa—contrary to 
the general voting procedure out­
lined by the council by-laws.
May I also advise you that all 
the present so-called representa­
tives on Council have been elected 
contrary to council by - laws, 
hence, even they do not legally 
hold office—in other wTords, Coun­
cil, as defined by its constitution 
and by-laws, does not exist.
Yours in continued agitation to 
right a structure toppling in the 
muck of disorganization and con­
fusion which leaves it “full of 
sound and fury, signifying noth­
ing.”

PM ’52
Editor, the Tartan:
Deek di Salvo’s comments on 
“The God That Failed” (Tartan, 
Jan. 15) express the need for a 
spiritual trend in modern society, 
a need which seems to me very 
real and very important.
But in striking at atheism and 
materialism, di Salvo seems also 
to imply (though he may not have 
meant to) an antagonism toward 
all manner of doubt and skeptic­
ism; and perhaps even a desire 
for a spiritual retreat to the 13th 
century or thereabouts.
But the rise of agnosticism was 
the inevitable companion of the 
birth of modern technology. When 
the human mind inquires freely 
into the world about it, it must 
also turn to spiritual questions, 
and often comes up with answers 
contrary to established dogma. 
Hence is a man led to become an 
atheist, or a skeptic, or merely a 
mild dissenter in the old ranks of 
religion.
That materialistic science, un­
controlled by a strain of idealism, 
can be an evil is true. But it is 
wrong to say that “brutal dicta­
torship” is the product of atheism. 
It is rather an outgrowth of greed, 
a thing which, along with dictator­
ships, existed long before man 
thought much of doubting his 
God (or gods).
Is it not possible that some of 
the philosophies that accompan­
ied the rise of science are of 
merit? Might there not be some 
need for "change in what di Salvo 
calls “the Judo-Christian tradi­
tion?” Doesn’t *progress in our 
material life perhaps demand a 
change in our form of worship? 
And maybe even in our beliefs? If 
age is the prime factor in the 
value of theology, we might do 
well to look into the merits of tree 
worship.
And the Judo-Christian tradi­
tion is far from being beaten 
down, as di Salvo says. Our 
churches are thriving. Religion is 
still waxing strong. And it might 
become still more powerful if it
were more willing to adapt itself 
to the modern world, the world 
formed, in part, by science.
True, a move toward the spirit­
ual is needed, but let’s not go too 
far in condemning science and its 
philosophies. Let’s take them for 
what they are worth and utilize 
them to improve our lot spiritually 
as well as materially.
Yours truly,
Interested Reader
Editor, the Tartan:
In response to the many ques­
tions asked of the Scotch ’n Sod^ 
board members, we hope we can 
explain the reasons behind the de­
cision to remodel the gymnasium 
into a Scotch ’n Soda Theater.
After putting a few heads to­
gether plus much research and 
outside advice, we have decided 
that it is better to put into some­
thing permanent the money we 
would spend on renting an audi­
torium, which may run as high as 
$1000, paying outside people $500 
to stand around and watch our 
personnel work, and renting equip­
ment. As most of us are sure it 
will be 10 years before a suitable 
auditorium will be erected on the 
CIT campus, we feel that money 
spent on an S’nS theater would be 
well used.
Knowing this, the question was, 
“Is there a building which could 
be used, by adding the needed 
changes, for such a production as 
S’nS?” Our choice finally nar­
rowed down to the school gymna­
sium, which could be prepared for 
such a show if we put our whole 
effort into it.
We plan to make several changes 
in the new theater to overcome 
present sight and sound problems. 
The stage floor will be extended so 
that the production can be brought 
closer to the audience. Seats are 
going to be raised so that it will be 
possible for everyone to see more 
than the back of someone’s head. 
We are consulting sound engineers 
and will, by adding to the present 
PA system, make it possible for all 
to hear. The area of the theater 
not used for-seating will be cur­
tained off to remove the hollow 
barn effect.
The executive board feels that 
the several thousand dollars to be 
spent on these improvements will 
be well invested, and the club will 
at last have a theater that will be 
near at hand and remove all the 
problems faced by former produc­
tions.

American
Dilemma
By Deek di Salvo
Like a child giving up the toy 
of all his joy, American capitalism 
is faced with a choice; the matur­
ing realization that it must sac­
rifice our toy of plushness to sta­
bilize the free world economically 
and politically, or see those areas 
of the free world where poverty 
is king bow down before the ma­
jestic illusion of communism. It 
is a choice between Spartan free­
dom or impoverished slavery. If 
the land masses of Africa, the 
Middle East, and Asia are to be 
held within the ranks of free men, 
America must fill the stomach as 
well as capture the mind. Coupled 
with our abundant technology, we 
have within us the seed whose 
harvest can fill our world with 
peace and order—the priceless 
heritage of the individual and his 
freedom.' If our counter revolution 
is to be successful, it must be 
based on the world unity of nur­
tured bodies and free minds.
Ineffective and Immature
Since the mantle of supremacy 
has passed to us, we must wear it 
—or die. Because of our inferi­
ority in military power, we have 
been forced into the game of con­
tainment; because of a lack of 
positive conviction in our moral 
strength, we have been put on the 
defensive and own the dilemmas 
of defense; because of our distaste 
for world leadership and lack of 
world view, we have come ill 
prepared to lead in world diplo­
macy; thus our basic concept, the 
sustention of Europe, has been 
at the neglect of Asia. Our total 
leadership is thus ineffective and 
immature.
America, the great revolutionist 
for independence, was blinded by 
European concepts; so we have 
lost the great opportunity of 
turning areas long prostituted by 
colonialism into bulwarks in the 
fabric of free men. Impressed by 
British achievement in diplomacy, 
long since out of fashion, we have 
suppressed our voice that should 
have cried, “All men have the right 
to freedom!” It is unfortunate that 
European governments, cherishing 
freedom for themselves, were deaf 
to the great call for Asiatic and 
African’ freedom; it is more un­
fortunate that America’s immatur­
ity permitted a situation that is 
inherent in our concept of the way

The World On Parade: 
A Study Of The Cut
By Dick Durstine
Now that spring is in the air, and people are again beginning 
to seek outdoor life, the amateur student of human nature may move 
his offices out of doors. Skibo, which contains a wealth of types to 
be observed and listened to, can be supplemented by a new hunting 
grounds, the Cut. ? ~
Stationing ourselves behind an
election poster, so as not to be'seen 
and frighten the passers-by, we 
can stand and watch the endless 
parade.
Carts, Green Stuff, Towels
Early in the morning, the par­
ade starts, with the school em­
ployees coming for their day’s 
work. Up the stairs and across the 
walk move the dish collectors of 
Skibo, pushing then- little carts. 
There are the school janitors, bear­
ing sacks of that green stuff they 
put on the floor during classes so 
they will have something to 
sweep. And toward the gym goes 
the proverbial Frank, with an 
armload of priceless towels to be 
rationed out to deserving physical 
education students.
Soon, as the fog begins to clear 
to reveal a stark grey structure in 
the distance (said by some to con­
tain a nearby liberal arts college), 
forms begin to emerge from the 
faculty club, and move out the 
gravel walk which merges with 
the Cut near the new pari-mutuel 
board on the right going toward 
school. It is the faculty, swathed 
in black overcoats, moving slowly

Business Opportunity
Finally there are the students, 
some leisurely, some bearing little 
boxes, some with books, or mod­
ernistic statues. From the street­
car line comes a flow of engineers, 
complete with brief cases and 
slide rules, moving with high 
velocity across - the moors. This 
trip has in some case developed in­
to a race, yesterday’s winner be­
ing a junior EE, who paid 6.70, 
4.30, and 3.60. Anyone wishing to 
start a racing stable of engineer­
ing students should apply at the 
office of the dean of men.
The Day Ends
After the beginning of classes, 
the activity-is limited to a few 
stragglers, some pigeons and an 
occasional dog which has escaped 
from Skibo. At noon, business 
picks up, and toward the end of 
the day, everyone goes home, and 
the Cut is again deserted, except 
for a few nomads and their girls.
Another day is done.

Grown Steadily 
The symphonic band has grown 
greatly in the past four years. The 
marching band was reorganized 
after the war in 1946, but the sym­
phonic band was inactive until 
spring, 1948, when Mr. Schaefer 
directed the Kilties in the first con­
cert since 1941. At that time the 
band numbered seventy-five 
pieces, but it has now grown to a 
well balanced ninety, with un­
usually complete instrumentation.

Grove City 76-60 In Return To Early Form
The Tartan basketball team made a valiant attempt to re-enter 
the victory column as they defeated Grove City and Waynesburg this 
week to boost their season average to .500.
Holste Adds Scoring Punch ?---------------------------------------------------------
Grove City suffered at the hands 
of the Plaid Wednesday evening, 
losing by a score of 76-60. It was 
one of the few times this season 
that Coach Mel Cratsley has had 
a chance to send in the reserves 
in the last few minutes of play.
Hilary Holste led the scoring at­
tack with 22 point«. Tom Craig 
followed with 19, and Kay 
Thompson was third with 15. The 
Tartan game average was 63 
points previous to this week. An 
evident increase in field goal ac­
curacy has raised this figure con­
siderably.
Fast Break Humbles Jackets 
The second game of the week 
saw the Tartans victorious over 
an opposing team which definite­
ly had the height advantage. Tar­
tan speed again showed its value 
as the Skibos emerged on top 
72-67.
The scoring honors for this game 
went to Kay Thompson who came 
through with 20 points. Tom Craig 
was second with 17, and Hilary 
Holste third with 15. It was ob­
vious that the Waynesburg team 
was well prepared to expend extra j Davies,

Before coming to the Tartans

Bud led his team in points in their 
win in the state championship final

ord for the breaststroke. The^------------------------------------------------------—
other record breaker was Oberlin’s 
Lillie who narrowly bested Nick 
Demas in the 100 yard freestyle.
The invaders got off to an early 
lead as they won the medley relay 
in near record time. In the 220 
yard freestyle, Dick Kramer was 
touched out by Ohman of Oberlin, 
and this was repeated in the 50 
yard freestyle where Demas was 
again edged by Lillie. One of the 
closest races was the 150 yard 
medley. Bob Weddell pushed Hun­
sicker so hard that he broke Bob’s 
record of 1:49.8, lowering it to

Tech’s last attempt to close the

Astle, Gough, and Demas coasting 
to an easy victory to close the

POOR PAUL was having a fowl time. Even his best gal didn’t 
give a hoot for him. "Wise she hate me so?” he asked his 
roommate. "Simple, you stuffy old bird—because your hair’s 
always ruffled up! Better try Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic. It’s 
non-alcoholic Contains soothing Lanolin. And does tree things: 
Relieves annoying dryness. Removes loose, ugly dandruff. 
Grooms hair neatly and naturally all day long. (Even limb-ers 
up your scalp. And helps you pass the Finger-Nail Nest-er, 
Test!)” Paul got Wildroot Cream-Oil and now he’s a ’owling 
success. So why don’t you take a taxi-dermist to any drug or 
toilet goods counter to get a bottle or tube of Wildroot 
Cream-Oil. It’s your hair’s best friend! And ask for it at your 
barber shop.Then there’s no talon how the chicks'll go for you.

of life, to be used by communism
for its own selfish interest.
Cast Aside Victorianism 
America is now the bastion of 
free men, America must lead the 
world out of the confederacy of 
disunity and despair into the fed­
eration of law and order and hope! 
We have within us the answers to 
mankind’s cravings — freedom of 
spirit and security of body. We 
have within us a Pax Americana, 
if we find the courage to build 
that peace. We must meet the 
twentieth century using all our 
magnificent past to entice the 
present. We must own the 
strength to sacrifice ourselves and 
demand sacrifice from those who 
cry for peace and yet whose self­
ishness destroys the peace. We 
must cast aside the pleasantries 
of Victorian diplomacy and face
our times with action for our time. 
We must launch a counter refor­
mation to cleanse our government
of corruption and decay and a 
counter reformation among those 
governments to which our bounty 
goes.
Freedom to be Shouted
We have freedom! Freedom was 
not meant for barter nor for 
quiet words! Freedom’s to be 
shouted! Freedom stands above 
compromise! Freedom is our rev­
olution! We have inherited from 
the Christs, the Lincolns, the 
Ghandis—moral, spiritual and po­
litical truth; we cannot turn our 
back on destiny! If we die, lib­
erty dies! If we perish, a new 
dark age will cover all the earth 
—an age from whose darkness, 
1 freedom may never burst anew!
They tried to fool him with the “quick-trick** 
cigarette mildness tests—but he wouldn’t go astray! 
We know as well as he there’s only one fair way to 
test cigarette mildness. And millions of smokers agree!
It’s the sensible test...the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels 
as your steady smoke, on a day-after-day, 
pack-after-pack basis. No snap judgments. Once 
you’ve tried Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone* 
(T for Throat, T for Taste), you’ll see why...

be forgotten are the ladies, who 
will be furnished with dainty 
parasols.
A feature event of the evening 
will be the presentation of a prize 
to the lady wearing a hat most 
becoming the Gay Nineties Era. 
So all girls planning to attend bet­
ter begin now making a suitable 
chapeau.
Music for the evening will be 
by Wes Parker, one of the better
known of the local purveyors oi 
sweet danceable music. The regu­
lar dance music will at times be 
supplemented by a Gay Nineties 
melody.
The attendance at the previous 
events this year has been com­
mendable, so let’s all back Coun­
cil by making this dance a success 
as well.

And
Views
In spite of the general army- 
type standing in line atmosphere 
evident at registration, the ef­
ficiency of the plan is finally be­
ing noticed. Believe it or not, on 
Tuesday several fellows found 
they went through the entire pro­
cess in as little as 13 minutes!
It seems that the recent exploits 
of a few evening school students 
in Delaney’s Cave is old stuff to 
another group of evening students. 
These fellows, including Matt Ber- 
tovich, Frank Augustine, and a 
few others have been making reg­
ular trips there.
Sigma Delta Phi 
Celebrates 12th 
Anniversary
Members of Sigma Delta Phi 
fraternity held a party celebrating 
the twelfth anniversary of the or­
ganization at the Vogue Terrace, 
February 2. Members and their 
guests assembled for dinner in one 
of the private dining rooms. Fol­
lowing the dinner, social chair­
man Charles Keller, aided by 
president George Bogovich pre­
sided over the drawing and distri­
bution of the door prizes.
First prize a Westinghouse 
washer went to Mrs. Evelyn Wey- 
ant while Nick Pollack gained a 
cigarette lighter as second prize. 
Ineidently, the washer turned out 
to be the type that is placed un­
der a bolt and nut combination. 
However, Mrs. Weyant received 
the lovely floral decoration for 
the head table as a consolation 
prize from Kathleen Holleran, 
who assisted in drawing the win­
ners.
The group adjourned to reserved 
tables in the main ballroom, where 
everyone had an enjoyable even­
ing dancing to the music of Brad 
Hunt.
