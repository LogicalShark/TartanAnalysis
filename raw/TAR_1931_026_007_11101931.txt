INTERFRATERNITY 
COUNCIL TO ADOPT 
NEW RUSHING RULES
Rushing Season Shortened; 
Expenses to Be Cut 
Considerably
At its meeting Wednesday, Novem­
ber 4, the Intcrfratcrnity Council 
formulated a set of rules and regu­
lations to govern the rushing of new 
registrants for the ourrcnt year. As 
a whole the rushing rules arc the 
same as they have been in previous 
years, but there arc one or two 
very important changes.
This year the council has taken 
into consideration the present eco­
nomic conditions and the effect of a 
long rushing period upon the stu­
dents. It has made it impossible for 
fraternities to spend very much 
money, and has shortened the rush­
ing season.
The rushing period for fall regis­
trants will open on Saturday, Decem­
ber 5, at 9:30 a. m. and will extend 
until 1:00 a. m. Sunday, December 13.
In order to cut expenses of rush­
ing, the council has ruled that fra­
ternity men will not be allowed to 
attend any off-campus function with 
a ruslice, and on nights preceding 
a school day fraternity men must 
leave their rushccs before 10 p. m.
The council also will ask any 
fraternity man who is rooming with 
a freshman in the dormitories to 
change his room.
The Rushing Rules Committee in­
cludes: L. C. Brown, Chairman; J. 
J. Boushkc, G. M. Kountz, R. C. 
Binder and W. Finglass.
The complete rushing rules as 
passed by the Interfraternity coun­
cil will appear in the Tartan be­
fore the start of rushing season.
Council Shortens 
Time Of Silence
The Inter-Sorority Council wishes 
to call special attention to a
change in the duration of the si­
lence period. Silence period will 
terminate today at 4 p. m. as
Wednesday, November 11, the day 
originally set, is Armistice Day. 
Bids must be answered today. All 
bids by the sororities should have 
been in the Dean’s office yesterday 
morning by 9 o'clock.
Rushing season began on Sun­
day, October 25,- when a tea was 
given in Exhibition Hall in Arts 
School by the sororities. Their
social program continued until
Sunday night when the silence 
period began. The answering of 
the bids officially closes the rush­
ing season for this year.
PROM COMMITTEE 
MEMBERS NAMED
Attractive Program Will Be Arranged
At a meeting held last Thursday 
in the Yj M. C. A. ,officc, John 
Kronenberg, chairman of the Jun­
ior Prom, made the following defi­
nite committee appointments: Wil­
liam H. Hauser, vice chairman; 
Anthony J. Schmidt, decorations; 
Harold Cadmus, Jr., and Frederick 
Flaherty, tickets; Louis J. Mane- 
soitios, publicity; Robert A. Hutch­
ison, programs committee; and 
Robert R. Smith, orchestra.
Although no definite plans have 
been made, the committee . has 
pledged itself to secure the best 
music available. Complying with 
the requests of the Student Coun­
cil, favors will not be purchased 
for the Prom. The saving effected 
will go to help the committee de­
sign an attractive program.
Continuing the custom started 
two years ago, the Prom will be 
open to the entire school and to 
all alumni who wish to attend.
Seriously Speaking
A Column of World News Events 
By NATHAN MILLER
Britannia Votes
No classes will be held on 
Armistice Day, Wednesday, 
November 11. v
Last week there occurred in Eng­
land a. memorable outpouring of 
voters , who decided jn no unmis­
takable terms that they were to 
keep in power the National Coali­
tion which had been formed by 
members of all three parties—the 
Conservatives, Liberals and Labor- 
ites.
Ramsay MacDonald, the leader of 
the national government, had been 
the leader of the Labor Party until 
recently when, under stress of the 
financial emergency which led to 
the recession of England from the 
gold standard, lie renounced the 
principles of his socialist following 
and headed the tripartite cabinet. 
After the closing of Parliament lie 
appealed to the country on the 
basis of "calling in the doctors” to 
minister to Britain during the 
emergency. Apparently his pica was 
effective since the election returns 
gave witness to an almost unani­
mous support of his policy.
Although the Laborites had re­
pudiated the stand of their erst­
while leader, the country trooped
• hind the clarion call of Premier 
•Donald. The Labor leader had 
rred the wrath of his party 
.. jely because he had concurred
i.n a slashing of the dole for the 
unemployed' to the tune of 10 per 
cent. \ •
The vote cannot be interpreted 
as a swing toward conservatism 
entirely since it was not a party 
vote. Yet it implies a sad com­
mentary to the hopes of the Labor 
Party which had in brilliant fashion 
risen info power in the short space 
of about twenty years. With an 
advanced and thoroughgoing social­
ist program it had offered great 
hopes to '•those who had come to 
believe that a way out of economi': 
choas and stupidity would ultimate­
ly prevail. Within sight of a full 
majority and control of Parliament 
it has been set back now years.
Which all goes to show, in the 
opinion of one observer, that the 
mass or democratic electorate is 
slow to respond to constructive, 
visionary statesmanship. Rather, it 
throbs violently to fright, scarcs 
and particularly to pet hatreds. And 
how. well the politicians know how 
to play on these stops! We have 
seen our share of this technique in 
our own national elections, as wit­
ness especially the election of 1928 
in which voters were allowed to 
express their hatreds—racial, re­
ligious and social. With results 
that are all too apparent.

EXPERTS TO MEET 
MONDAY FOR SOFT 
COAL CONFERENCE
Recent Developments in 
Coal to Receive Atten­
tion of Experts
The diversified industries directly 
dependent upon soft coal will re­
ceive treatment at the hands of 
experts next week at the Third 
.International Conference on Bitu­
minous Coal, which will be held 
'under "fife auspices of Carnegie 
Tech. The congress will convene 
on Monday, November 16, and run 
through Thursday.
Beginning with coal above ground, 
practically every one of the vari­
ous commercial methods for its 
utilization will be treated by au­
thorities, in the several fields. Not 
only will scientific phases -of the 
industry be considered, but this 
year, economic questions will re­
ceive major attention. Thus the 
first day of the meeting will be 
devoted entirely to a consideration, 
of the immediate and practical 
problems facing the disorganized 
bituminous industry.
One of the more recent develop­
ments in fuel technology has been 
the increased use of pulverized 
coal. Difficulties in preparing, 
transporting, and storing the prod­
uct arc gradually being solved by 
the engineer. The Germans have 
experimented with pipe lines for 
carrying powdered coal for short 
distances, and are using specially 
designed tank cars for 'long hauls. 
Other scientists have attempted to 
suspend finely ground coal in a 
liquid medium for transportation. 
These experiments and others in­
volving the use of powdered coal 
on steamships and locomotives will 
be reported at the meeting.
Recent discoveries of petroleum 
in America have caused interest in 
the processes for forming oil from 
coal to wane in this couhtry, but 
nations which lack oil wells within 
their boundaries have continued 
experiments along these lines. Re­
ports on new experiments in these 
fields will be given by technolog­
ists from Belgium, German}', France, 
and England.
The important gas industry, on 
which the English scientists have 
done the greatest amount of re­
search, will occupy an important 
place on the program.
• These and many other problems 
will be discussed before an audi­
ence of about 2,000 persons, com­
posed of scientists, coal operators, 
and executives of companies inter­
ested in the products of coal. The 
public is invited' to attend.
Cwens to Lower Prices
For Tea Dance Thursday
The Cwens, women’s sophomore 
honorary, will hold a tea dance i 
the Union on -Thursday, November 
19, from 4:3Q to 6. Music will be 
furnished by Jerry McGeorge’s or­
chestra.
An unusual feature will be the 
change in prices, 35 cents for men, 
and 25 cents for women. As this 
is the first tea dance sponsored by 
the present Cwens, it is hoped 
that, everyone will li^lp to make it 
a success.
The committee, selected from the 
present Cwens in Margaret Mor­
rison and Arts School, will be: 
Charlotte Rothrock, social chair­
man; Mary Husband, Evelyn Gam­
ble, and Virginia Artz.

ing Saturday, November 21, when 
a testimonial to the football team 
in the form of a dance will be 
given. The dance will be known 
as a Blanket Hop; the purpose 
being to. present to the graduating 
members of the'football team who 
have become three letter men suit­
able recognition for their efforts. .
Large red blankets, carrying the 
players’ names and the letter "C,” 
will, be presented to the three sen­
iors, Captain Armcntrout, Alex 
Ducanis and Don Fletcher. The 
dance will take place in the Union

DIRECTORIES ON 
SALE NEXT WEEK
Student Salesmen to . Sell Books on Campus
The eighth annual Student Di­
rector}', a feature of Tri-Publica- 
tions, will be placed on sale on the 
campus one week from today. Di­
rectories may be purchased at that 
time from student salesmen who will 
be located in thc^halls of all schools 
and in the campus cafeterias. The 
price will be fifty cents.
The staff of Tri-Publications is 
made up of John C. Horning, Editor- 
in-ChieJ; Harry S. Hower, Jr., Busi­
ness Manager, and Floy A. Sample, 
Managing Editor.
The Student Directory contains 
the name, home and school addresses, 
telephone number, course, and class 
of every day student. It includes 
lists of the members and pledges of 
social and honorary fraternities and 
sororities, the names of the officers 
of each class and of the four 
Senates, and the officers and mem­
bers of the Student Council. A 
new feature this year will be a list' 
of abbreviations of all the Pittsburgh 
telephone exchanges, and, as usual, 
the abbreviations and numbers of the 
various courses will be given.
The directory is particularly val­
uable during fraternity rushing 
season as it is the only publica­
tion that contains up to date lists 
of fraternity members and Fresh­
men’s addresses. While the direc­
tories are particulrly useful at this 
season of the year they are also 
a great aid in sending Christmas 
cards and communicating during 
summer vacation.
BAND TRIP TO 
PHILA. IS OFF
According to a report from the 
athletic office, the Kiltie Band will 
be unable to accompany the foot­
ball team to the Temple-Carnegie 
game in Philadelphia this Satur­
day, because of unsatisfactory fi­
nancial conditions. For this rea­
son also, the Band will be able to 
spend only two days in New York 
City while on the New York Uni- 
versity-Carnegie trip.
Clarence Overbid, graduate man­
ager of athletics, has offered a 
prize of $5 for an acceptable stunt 
that the Kilties might perform be­
tween halves at the football games. 
All students arc eligible to submit 
suggestions. These suggestions 
should be turned in to the office 
of the graduate manager of ath­
letics in the gymnasium, ad­
dressed to the care of Wendell W.
Jones, who is the manager of the
Kiltie Band. The winner of the
prize will be announced in a fu­
ture issue of the Carnegie Tartan.

ed a series of .performances of 
“Trelawney of . the Wells,” by Ar­

ance for students will be given on 
Tuesday evening, November 17.
“Trelawney of the Wells” is a 
very apt selection for presentation 
to the alumni especially, for it was 
first given at Carnegie in 1920, 
and without doubt a number of 
the members of the original cast 
were present on November 7 to 
see their successors carry on. 
Those were the early days of the 
Drama School, when Thomas 
Wood Stevens, its founder, was. 
still its head. Professor Chester

of Executive Com­
mittee

be held in the New Union, Fri­
day, January 8, from 9 to 1, ac­
cording to an announcement of the 
committee. The event was orig­
inally scheduled for Friday, De­
cember 11, but as this datfe would 
fall during the coming rushing 
period, it seemed advisable to 
avoid any conflict and to hold the 
affair the first Friday after the re­
turn from Christmas vacation.
The Hop is held this year on 
the campus in compliance with the 
edict of Student Council. In view 
of this fact, the admission price 
will probably be reduced.

selected, but a number of popular 
broadcasting orchestras are being 
considered by the committee, and 
the selection will be announced 
later. The Hop will be informal 
as in the past.

STUDENT TO GIVE $1.0Q
“Y” Budgets Will Be Handled 
By General Welfare 
Committee
Carnegie'i campaign drive to raise 
its quota oF $2,500 for the Joint: 
Campaign of the Allegheny County; 
Emergency Association and thd 
Welfare Fund was officially inau­
gurated this morning under the 
joint-chairmanship of Charles E, 
Shatvet '33, and Ruth Brooks ’32, 
members of the Student Council. 
The campaign will continue until 
November 23. This campaign will 
take the place of the usual annual 
Y. M. and Y. W. C. A. metnber-t 
ship drives, the budgets of campus 
“Y’s” for the coming year having 
been appropriated by the Welfare 
Fund Committee in order to elimi­
nate t.wo separate drives which' 
would be otherwise necessary. The1 
“Y’s” are co-operating with the 
Welfare Committee because of the 
vital necessity of raising funds to 
furnish relief in Allegheny Count}-; 
this winter.
In order to raise the $2,500 
quota, a minimum donation of $L 
will be asked from each student. 
The co-chairmen have laid exten­
sive plans which call for the per­
sonal solicitation of every student 
on the campus. One hundred andi 
twelve students have been ap­
pointed to head the solicitation it* 
each section or class division oE 
each department in all collt¿> .. 
Each student who donates any; 
amount will received an orange 
feather to wear and he automati­
cally becomes a member of thd 
Red Cross.
The Allegheny County drive i< 
a part of the national mobilization, 
of welfare and relief forces now* 
being developed by President Hoo-i 
ver and his Unemployment Com-« 
mittee. It is hoped to raise $5,-« 
981,184 in Allegheny County. Thred 
million dollars of the amount will] 
provide for emergency employ­
ment and for unemployed relief 
while the remainder will be used’ 
by the Welfare Fund organizan, 
tions. The Welfare Program in-* 
eludes family and individual help* 
child care, health promotion, de-« 
vcloping good citizens, service and] 
co-ordination, financing the wel­
fare fund, the contingent fund, and} 
to provide for last year’s deficit.
This year 77 Pittsburgh welfare 
agencies will be financed through1 
the Welfare Fund. Thirty-seven 
of these agencies are new mem­
bers this year.

THOSE OF US who were denied the privilege of making 
an extended survey of Pittsburgh’s jailing system should not consider this a great loss, for in the years to comc the Pitt- 
Carnegie’ football game of 1931 will be remembered as a hard fought battle in which the plucky playing of the Plaid griddcrs 
did much to make the Panther’s 14 to 6 margin look as small as possible. While accepting defeat from the superior Pitt squad, the Steffen-Waddcll machine threw such a scare into 
the pack of Panthers that the Pitt stands frequently responded 
with "Hold that line Pitt." ....... .......................................................
IT WAS A PLEASURE to watch the work of the Tar­tan linemen as they rubbed noses with the highly touted Pitt 
line. The pluarlity of first downs in favor of Carnegie was largely the result of their prying the Panther line apart and 
'again holding the ball toters intact.The Slcibos’ surprise package of the clay was contained in 
155 pounds of half back, all traveling under the name-plate of 
John Graveno. His catch of Bevcvino’s lofty pass for a touch- flown was supplimented by a considerable amount of ball carry­
ing.* * * * ''i* *
CARNEGIE’S INJURED LIST was increased last week 
when Jerry O’Toole turned up with internal sickness. He is 
due to be out of the hospital by now, but his condition will keep him out of the Temple game on Saturday. Lewis and 
Hcizncr, with their leg injuries, arc on the road to recovery, although it will be another year before they appear on the grid­iron. Other members of the squad possess slight bruises that 
should wear off by Saturday,. * * >K * * *
THE TARTAN BOXING ELEMENT, with about five 
full weeks of training before the initial encounter, has settled down to its serious routine of daily work-outs. Jeff Burke, Tom .'Waldron, Henry Carr, Ralph Atlas, and Royal Wertz represent 
a nucleus about which Coach Sesto will build a team for this 
season.Head Manager jBill Tauriello has announced the call for ap­plicants in the manager’s line. There arc many openings in this side of the sport, and only those who have a definite interest in boxing should apply. Any interested parties should report 
to the gym some afternoon this week.

VARSITY AND FRESHMEN HARRIERS will give the only home preformances of the Skibo sport program for this week. They will run with a strong West Virginia combination through the Schenley Park course on Saturday morning. The 
Mountaineers have been maintaining a winning pace in their meets thus far, and are sure to make the going tough for Coach 
11 a I forty's runners. Shadyside Academy will give the Plcbcs a run for their money over the former’s course tomorrow.!(< 1|< * * >»< >)<
TÎ-',MPLE\S. G RIDJRONERS are expected to give no little opposition to the Plaid efforts next, Saturday in. Philadelphia for their playing to date has brought every ‘game in their favor. The desire to remain as one of the East’s undefeated elevens is foremost in the minds of the Temple Owls, and it is entirely 
within the scope of the Slcibos to ' do a certain amount of 
damage.
UNDEFEATED OWLS 
NEXT OPPONENTS 
OF SKIBO CLAN
Tartans Seek to Repeat 
Last Year’s Win; 
Temple Strong
After facing the heavy artillery 
of Purdue, Notre Dame and Pitt 
on successive Saturdays, Coaches 
Steffen and Waddell arc going to 
have a tough assignment in keep­
ing the team from suffering a let­
down on the Temple game. The 
O.wls a lie not the kind of team 
that allows a rival to let down. 
The stubborn resistance they gave 
to the Tartan’s 1930 machine is 
not being forgotten by the Skibo 
veterans, and all efforts arc being 
made to have the team at top 
form for the Philadelphia encoun­
ter.
Temple has had one of the most 
successful seasons in many years. 
Undefeated and untied, they have 
bowled over, by healthy margins, 
first rate teams such as W. & J., 
Haskell, Villanova and Penn State, 
not to mention several minor op­
ponents. They arc considered to 
•be one of the toughest teams 
along the eastern seaboard.
The Carnegie team will have 
several of its cripple? back to help 
the cause./ Captain Armcntrout, 
‘injured early in the Pitt game, is 
expected to be back tearing of! 
the yardage. The Big Train suf­
fered a bruised kneecap and had 
to be taken out early in the sec­
ond - quarter.
Fullback Jerry O’Toole, .suffer­
ing from internal injuries, will 
probably be out of the Temple 
game, but is expected to be in 
shape for N. Y. U.
Lewis and Hcinzer, of course, 
arc definitely out.
The Pitt game emphasized that 
the Tartan reserves arc of more 
than mediocre ability. The pass­
ing combination of Bcvcvino to 
either Graveno or Ostrosky kept 
tlfe Panther crew in continuous 
hot water throughout most of the 
fourth quarter and ultimately led 
to the lone Skibo touchdown. 
Kcbc and Jones were plenty tough 
on the1 defense, breaking up the 
Pitt fourth period offensive com­
pletely.
A record crowd is expected for 
the game, if last year’s attendance 
is any indication. The Carnegie 
Tech, machine pleased the Phila­
delphia fans no little amount with 
its uncanny selection of tricky 
plays. The Tartans came back to 
smother the Owls 32-13 after Tem­
ple had established an early 13-6
Skibo Senior
re A'tt —
Don Fletcher, one of the four 
seniors in the lineup, played an un­
usually fine game at tackle against 
Pitt Saturday.
For the past several seasons Don 
has been troubled with a trick knee, 
but an operation last spring appears 
to have cured the ailing, member 
and now he’s one of the hardest 
men on the squad to get around. 
It’s going to take a real man to fill 
the shoes of this two hundred-pound 
giant.

1 see tlikt another columnist is la­
menting the fact that he docs not 
obtain the prominence he thinks he 
deserves on tiiis page. Didja Notice 
as all right in its way, but when com­
pared with me, doing nothing, it 
doesn’t have a show. Here I am 
writing nothing all the time, and 
can’t get anywhere when this writer 
wants to crash through with a bang. 
At all events I hope he or she is 
satisfied with the placement in the 
' last issue of the Tartan.
Believe it or not, but there is <i 
night student who conics to the cam­
pus at night in a car all tuned up 
with a radio. Hqw do I know? Heard 
it, of course. That certainly is some­
thing. Bel he listens in on Amos and 
'Andy on the campus, because he has 
'to leave before supper in order to 
secure a placc to park on the cam­
pus. Believe me, if I had a radio I 
wouldn’t be driving over to the cam­
pus to listen in. But then, everybody 
isn’t like me. A radio in a car to me 
is as useless as a master of cere­
monies at a smoker or rather the 
one at our last engineering affair.
{ And speaking of this individual, 
Well he didn’t even introduce all the 
¡’talent which was on hand to enter­
tain the boys. Where they found 
‘him, or what he was good for, is a baffling question to me. Why, I 
Could do as well myself, doing noth­
ing, and 1 assure you that i would 
jcomc off with the prize. I always 
. .thought a master of ceremonies took 
icare of introducing all the perform­
ers, a general all around nuisance as 
It were, but not this particular one. 
£ic seemed to fit in better chatting to 
«ome individual in a secluded spot in 
¦the Union. Next time I am going 
\o apply for the job, and then watch 
*nc sit around.
And as to smokers—did you notice 
how the engineers tried to crash-the 
pates of the Industries smoker the 
fiieek following ours? They weren’t 
i/atisficd with their own; they had to 
too over to the Gym on the next 
Saturday. Why they did, I don’t 
\fsnow, because we had one of our 
town on October 24. But that’s like 
i Everything else, some people zuant to 
1lake everything in and then howl 
Vbout it, never satisfied. Maybe they 
tfiought they zuould be better enter­
tained than we were; not so much 
squabbling, at least I am told so.
; Speaking of holidays, well we have 
tone this week—Armistice Day, No­
vember 11. That suits me just right.r
othing to do for one night. What 
can’t understand is \vhy they don’t 
fcave more holidays io\ us to enjoy. 
[If I had my way, I would have a 
(holiday every day of the night school 
year. Some conglomeration of words, 
iday and night, but I suppose you 
fcdll get my meaning—no night school 
at night. Just register and pay our 
fees and proceed to have holidays. 
fTlic institution would surely get rich 
pn this program and why not?
/ notice they don’t want poetry or 
Verse for the Plaid. - This suits me 
•just right because as a poet I zuould 
intike a first class broom pusher or 
some such elevated occupation I am 
vo hand at rhymning (ab—ab—efg— 
1tfff—or some such notation). I leave 
'that to the better qualified people 
¡K’/io arc more enlightened than engi- 
I 'i^ers on subjects and if you don’t 
believe me, just ask some night en­
gineer; you’re sure to get the zurong 
answer—and who cares.

Kiltie Band Receives 
Blankets Donated 
By Night Industries
Were Used For First Time At Tech-Pitt Game
After many weeks of effort on 
the part' of Edward E. McDonald 
of the Night College of Industries, 
the Kiltie Band, will now be able 
to appear at the football games 
with suitable coverings from the 
inclement weather which usually 
prevails at this time of the year. 
For some years Mr. McDonald 
was aware that this group’of stu­
dents was inadequately provided 
for when they went on the various 
football fields so he set about to 
secure individual blankets for the 
band to use when they were not 
parading on the field. Although 
the uniform of the Kiltie Band is 
extremely unique,-- the nature of 
this uniformáis such that some cov­
ering is necessary to protect the 
members.
Having decided upon the cover­
ing, the next thing was to secure a 
blanket which would be suitable
for use with the kilts. Mr. Mc­
Donald canvassed the country for 
such a blanket and after much
time and effort on his part he was
able to have manufactured a 'spe­
cial blanket employing the tartan 
colors correctly woven into a blan­
ket which would match up with 
the uniforms. The securing of
these blankets for the band is the 
latest achievement of the many 
worthwhile deeds which Mr. Mc­
Donald has accomplished during 
his years on the night campus, and 
this, by the way, is the second do­
nation to the band which he was 
instrumental in obtaining from the 
night groups, they having donated 
ten new uniforms to the. band two 
years ago.
Every member of the band will 
be equipped with an individual 
blanket, seventy-two in all, and 
these blankets arc the gift from 
the Night College of Industries. 
The blankets have been received 
from the manufacturer and will be 
used for the first time during the 
Tcch-Pitt football game at the 
Stadium on Saturday, November 7.

Council To Hold 
Dance On Nov. 27
On November 27 the Night Stu­
dent Council will hold the first 
of its scries of dances. This event 
opens the social year of the Coun­
cil. The Men’s Gymnasium will 
be used again this year in order 
to accommodate the large attend­
ance whicjj seems to grow year by 
year.
The council dances have proven 
very popular in the past. Last 
year the auditorium was taxed to 
its capacity on two occasions. In 
next week’s Plaid _furthcr details 
will be given, as by then the com­
mittee will have the program pretty 
well under way.
The usual admission charge of 
$1 will be in effect again this year. 
Tickets arc now on sale by the 
night school salesmen in all the 
colleges. This first dance comcs 
during the thanksgiving recess and 
will give everyone a chance to get 
a little breathing spell after the first 
six weeks’ work.
So if you haven’t obtained your 
ticket be sure and see one of the 
salesmen soon. They arc there to 
serve you and the best way you 
can ‘show yeur appreciation is by 
buying a ticket. If you have friends 
who would like to come then buy 
the extra tickets and bring them 
along. They are welcome to any 
of the Council dances.
Night College , 
Of Fine Arts 
Elect Officers
The Night College of Fine Arts 
held its annual election of officers 
on Friday evening, October 30, at 
which time the officers for the 
year were electcd. A large attend­
ance of those students who are in­
terested in the college’s affairs re­
sponded to the announcements and 
notices calling the election.
After a few introductory re­
marks by William R. Hodder, 
president of the Night Student 
Council, the election got under 
Way. The results of the election 
placed Henry E. Mauro, Presi­
dent; Martin B. Hudale, Vice 
President; Henry A. Swartz, Sec­
retary, and Andrew N. Evans, 
Treasurer.
These men arc well qualified to 
carry on the affairs of the Night 
College of Fine Arts, and there is 
every reason to expect a very suc­
cessful year. The1 Plaid takes this 
occasion to congratulate them up­
on their election to office. S.

the hands’ of all such night students. 
The handbook contains a great deal 
of useful information to the night 
students and many times questions 
can be answered by referring to the 
index and looking up the information 
given on the desired question.
By reporting to the Cashier’s office 
any night and hours on which the 
office is scheduled to be open and 
presenting your registration card, yoiS 
may obtain the handbook free. In 
the bade of the book several blank 
pages arc purposely left for your 
convenience for notes and this point 
is worth considering. The handbook 
should be a constant companion in 
your pocket as it is neatly gotten 
up and bound.

Camels are never parched or toasted!
FitESHNESS and flavor in a cigarette trace right 
back to natural moisture.
If you overheat or process tobacco so harshly as 
to dry out all natural moisture you drive out fresh­
ness and flavor too.
Camel never parches or toasts the fine Turkish and 
mild Domestic tobaccos it uses—they are naturally 
smooth, cool, mellow, with natural moisture retained.

THE CARNEGIE TARTÀ7T
INTERCOLLEGIATE CLIPS
Nation wide radio announcement of the incident 
giving the policc credit (for what?) Press stories 
about the boys hearing the game over the jail 
radio. (The game wasn't even broadcast.) Col­
ored attendants tell the boys the score at the half 
and end of the game. A worse dinner. Wait, wait.
Finally release after 20 hours of prison life . . .
Thrcc-fourths of us yanked out of bed and charged 
with riot, put in the bastile for a day, the day of 
the best football game of the season. There ain’t 
no justice!;
The grand anticlimax at the five-minute trial in 
Morals Court where all were honorably discharged 
with the school assuming the responsibility. It 
should never have been taken out of the school's
hands in the first place. The result: Nation wide
prejudiced publicity in favor of Pittsburgh’s "Fin­
est”—Nation wide stirring about student riots 
gleaned from the frightfully exaggerated newspaper 
stories—Unwarranted publicity for Carnegie Tech— 
Unwarranted personal publicity for many innocent 
students.
Riot? !
The cops couldn’t take the wisecracks that as­
sailed them from the dorms so they called reserves 
and stormed the hill. Jn the words of Inspector 
Hoey, "Our men charged up the hill, in the face of 
a barrage of bottles, bricks, and apples and got 
their men.” The cxcusc for the charge was that 
the boys were throwing things from the windows 
and chanced to score on a plainclothesman. Any­
one with half an eye can see that no one would be 
in range of missies thrown from the offending 
Scobell Hall unless they were on the dormitory 
lawn. Orders were to clean out the dorm so that 
all the offenders and anybody else would be taken 
in. At the time of the raid about a score of fel­
lows were dressed and about. Over one hundred 
were arrested for rioting. Doors kicked in, fellows 
dragged out of bed and ordered to get dressed.
Then a free ride to the Oakland jug. Here some 
of the Oakland force with their king’s English dc- 
•mandcd in such terms, “Wot did yousc boys have 
to do wid this?” Cells for 35 prisoners and over 
four times that many present. Tired and disgusted 
they curled up on the floor and on the top of the 
cages. An early riser rousing from*) his bed of bars 
tripped on a water pipe which broke at a rotten 
joint and flooded the cell room. Then another 
buggy ride to a downtown station to spend the 
morning. So crowded in the cells that they had to 
sit down in shifts. Such remarks as "Any rats 
over there?” "No1, we’ve got roaches as big as 
rats, though.” "fhat’s nothing, here’s one as big 
as a fox.”
Not even the big shots escaped. Looking around 
one spies the President of the Student Council, 
President of Scobell, President of the A. I. E. E.,
a Th eta Tau.

Enforcing The Law
The customary bonfire and pep rally held by the dormi- 
tpry students on the eve of the Pitt game presents as its 
aftermath several vit^l considerations. Today there are 
approximately one hundred and twenty students and alumni 
of Carnegie' that hayc policc records against their charac­
ter. Carnegie has received a serious blemish upon its own 
good name—considerable damage has been done to school 
property—and the breach between the students and the 
police is ever widening.
It is hard to reach,an exact story as to what occurred 
during the riot Friday night, but most reports confirm this 
story. The policc and firemen were called upon to ex­
tinguish the bonfire which was being held in a public 
thoroughfare. This fire, started by a relatively small group 
of the dormitory men, was unlawful, as it was conducted 
upon city property, and was restricting traffic.
Following the act of the pplice in dispersing the crowd, 
the students withdrew to the school property surrounding 
the dormitories and continued their pep rally, ,with occa­
sional verbal attacks upon the police who continued to 
linger about. It appears that some individual, or indivi­
duals, imbued with the mob spirit and revealing moronis- 
tic tendencies, did strike' the police with missiles and injure 
several. The ones guilty, of this attack then (led into the 
night and eluded chase.
Failing at securing the ofTcndcrs, the policc apparently 
acting upon orders to bring to the station house what 
students they could find, regardless of their connection with 
the affair, forced entrance to the dormitories, brqke into 
the rooms and took from bed, men who had been asleep 
for several hours and were completely oblivious of the pro­
ceedings. In such manner nearly .one hundred and twenty 
men were, assembled, taken to jail, and retained there for 
about eighteen hours.
Although this affair was doubtless intended to be but a suitable tribute to a popular football team, it was known 
at the time of starting the bonfire that the police would 
probably interfere. : It is doubtless true that the students still resenting the previous skirmishes with the police, did foster the idea of renewing the apparent feud. However if the students’ actions were premeditated so were the actions 
of the officers, for the verbal threat to “get” the students < s|iould they continue to be a nuisance was made by the district officers on several occasions.
The police acted within their authority in dispersing the‘group holding the bonfire, and in attempting to appre­hend the ones guilty of the assault. Inasmuch as it was 
•apparent that the guilty : parties did escape beyond the ; ...limits of the dormitories, upon what grounds did the police 
enter the men’s halls and-force .entrance into private rooms to apprehend persons who could have had absolutely no 
connection with the disorder? Would their actions not have been as illegal had they forced entrance to the faculty residences or girls’ dormitories adjoining the buildings they did enter?
Regardless of the legal technicalities involved in the -forced entrance, the fact remains that a large number of 
men- Avere forced into jail and criminal records entered 
against them when it was obvious that the great majority were entirely innocent. The defaming of a man’s character by causing false , arrest is a serious charge and one upon 
which the injured party can obtain considerable redress. 
An instructor in the school, numerous alumni returned for 
the homecoming celebration, leaders of various student bodies, including the student council and others, were in-• eluded in the group arrested.
Beyond the personal element of the outbreak there has .Keen serious damage to the good name of the school. 
.Doubtless among the students, and those who will become 
future students at Carnegie, the affair is considered lightly. However, in the minds of the parents of the community, the situation is considerably more serious.
It is apparent that no solution has been reached as to the proper method of handling these periodic outbreaks and 
each year conditions arc becoming more grave. A joint agreement, such as formed between the student councils 
of Pitt and Carnegie, .should be made in an effort to pre­vent future repetitions of the wholesale arrests. The ideal 
solution would have the Carnegie, student council assume responsibility for conduct of the students while upon school 
grounds, and the police restrict their activities to quelling whatever of those disorders affect public property. As long as the police continue to invade school property the 
students will retaliate and this foolish feud will have no ending.
