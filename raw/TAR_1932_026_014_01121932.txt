At Match
NEW POLICY PLANNED
Venetian Serenaders Will 
Play For Dance in 
Thistle Hall
Saturday night Carnegie opens 
its home boxing schedule with a 
match engaging West Virginia, in 
the Gymnasium, followed by a 
dance in the new Thistle Hall.
The dance is being held in con­
junction with the Athletic Associa­
tion and the [student body as a 
means of encouraging adoption of 
the new practice this year of wear­
ing formal attire at all boxing 
matches. The move approving the 
wearing of evening clothes at box­
ing matches in the school Gymna­
sium. is an attempt to follow the 
lead taken at a number of colleges 
throughout the country who have 
decided that collegiate boxing 
matches should reflect an improved 
. atmosphere from that prevalent at 
public exhibitions of the same 
sport.
No attempt is being made to re­
strict attendance at either the 
game or the dance following on 
the basis of formal attire. It is 
not to be considered compulsory in 
any respect. It is the hope of 
the sponsors of boxing at Carnegie 
that the students will show a will­
ingness to aid in raising the sport 
to the social plane it merits as. a 
collegiate contest. Special seats 
will be reserved for those appear- 
; ing in formal clothes.
/ Music for the dance, which is 
scheduled from 9 till 12 o’clock, 
will be furnished by the Venetian 
Serenaders, a local band which has 
appeared quite often at Carnegie 
dances. Tickets, which are sold 
only at the door will be priced at 
one dollar. For those not attend­
ing the match in the gymnasium, 
entrance to Thistle Hall will be by 
way of the new approach walk 
near Skibo Inn. Those coming 
from the Gymnasium will enter di­
rectly into the hall through the 
new entrance at the right of the 
stage in the men’s gym.
Seriously 
Speaking
A COLUMN OF CURIOUS COMMENT 
BY NATHAN MILLER
Bankrupt Bankers
In a season characterized by an 
unusual degree of mildness, it is 
strange to observe the amount of 
“freeze” in the banking world. Very 
little seems to be frozen except as­
sets, confidence and economic sanity 
in general.
If one can afford to be sardonic at 
this time, it is ludicrous to observe 
how quickly the banker has fallen 
from his high perch' in our social 
world to the ignominy which is be­
ing thrust upon him today from all 
sides. Formerly in the B. P. years 
(Before Prosperity), the home-town 
banker enjoyed an enviable prestige 
comparable only Mo that of the 
favorite preacher of the village. In 
the social and fraternal world, his 
family outranked even that of the 
town * official. The situation was not 
‘dissimilar in the larger centers of 
population. In the high councils of 
the nation the influence of the inter­
national banker was not to be dis­
counted either.
' To seek the causes of the general 
debacle which seems to have over­
come the banks and the banking fra­
ternity one need only remind oneself 
of the fact that American banker di­
rectors have been recruited largely 
from the lowliest strata of the popu­
lation ; that they have graduated from 
other businesses where they made 
recognizable successes but without the 
slightest expert or intimate acquaint­
ance with finance. To be a barber or 
second-hand ciothes dealer, one needs 
a license but to become a banker one 
needed only consummate self-confi­
dence and salesmanship. With the re­
sult that might have been awaited: 
American, banking has the most un­
enviable record of having the larg­
est number of bank failures of any 
country even in "good" years.
Naturally when the present eco­
nomic holocaust descended, we found 
that the banks. presumable the con- 
servitive guardians of the savings 
of widows, orphans and other busi­
ness men, were in a parlous condi­
tion largely because the}’' had under­
written the New Economic Era of

Council Approves Cwen Tea Dance; 
Makes Regulations For Thistle Hall
Rules Passed Regarding 
Use, Price and Care 
of New Union
The Student Council at a recent 
meeting approved the petition pre­
sented by the Cwens for a tea 
dance to be held in Thistle Hall 
January 13, from 4:30 to 7 o'clock. 
The budget for the Men's Junior 
Prom, which will be held off the 
campus on February 12, was also 
approved by the council.
Harvey Collins, the chairman of 
a special committee, reported that 
the Open Forum Club „invited Dr. 
Baker to speak at a meeting at 
which they failed to produce any 
audience. This report will be re­
ferred to later, when their consti­
tution is presented for the coun­
cil’s approval.
The rules governing the use of 
Thistle Hall were announced at 
the meeting, and it was recom­
mended that they be brought be­
fore ,the student body. The rules 
which have been drawn up for the 
use of Thistle Hall are:
1. In scheduling this hall, first 
consideration shall be given to 
regularly scheduled classes.. Dr. 
Ihrig, as chairman of tre Calen­
dar and Schedule committee, shall 
have the authority to make these 
assignments semester by semester, 
with the exception of Thursday 
Friday and Saturday evenings.
2. The assignment of the hall 
for all events other than those 
stated in Paragraph 1 shall rest

Price Reduced 
On Junior Prom; 
Date Announced
The price of the tickcts for the 
Men’s Junior Prom, will be $6.50. 
This price contrasted with the price 
of last year,. which, was $7.50 and 
the price of. two years ago, which 
was $9.50, represents a considerable 
saving to the students. Tickets will 
be on sale January 15 and may be 
purchased at the Y. M. C. A. office 
or from any member of the Prom 
committee or Delta Skull. The 
tickets will be sold in one payment, 
thus discontinuing the practice of 
an initial and final installment. The 
prom is not limited to members 
of the upper classes and all stu­
dents; alumni, and their guests may 
attend.
Selection of the orchestra for the 
prom has been progressing rapidly 
and the choice, as a result of a 
vote taken at the Junior Prom Tea 
Dance, has been limited to nine 
nationally famous orchestras. 'They 
are: Isham Jones, Paul Tremaine, 
Paul Specht, Bernie Cummins, Will 
Osborne, Gus Arnheim, Jan Gar­
ber, Casa Loma and Husk O’Hare.
The Program committee headed 
by Robert A. Hutchion has selected 
the program for the prom and the 
order will go in this week. The 
programs will have a white leather 
cover with the school seal stamped 
in gold. A silk braid with pencil 
will be attached.
The date for the prom has been 
set for February 12, Lincoln^ Birth­
day, and the last night of first 
semester examinations. The Eng­
lish Room of the Fort Pitt Hotel 
will be the scene of the formal. 
Arrangements are being made by 
the Decoration committee for unique 
electrical effects.
First Thistle Hall Tea 
Dance Tomorow At 4
The Cwens, sophomore wom­
en’s honorary society, will hold 
a tea dance in Thistle Hall, 
the new Union, tomorrow after­
noon from 4 to 6. The music 
for the dancing\_will be fur­
nished by Will Ryshanek and 
his eight-piece orchestra. Will 
Ryshanck’s orchestra, a campus 
group of music students, .has 
gained much popularity by its 
music at several of the night 
school dances. The prices for 
the dance will be 25 cents for 
the women and 35 ccnts for- 
the men.
The Cwen society of Pitt will 
attend the dance. The music 
will be broadcast over WWSW 
from 4:45 till 5:15.
ARCH. STUDENTS 
WIN SIX MEDALS
James Mitchell Receives First 
Prize Bronze Medal 
For Problem
At the recent Beaux Arts judg­
ment in New York City the De­
partment of Architecture of Car­
negie was awarded six medals on 
the second graduating senior proj 
ect, “A Terra Cotta Plant.” 
Carnegie’s projects manifested ; 
complete practical understanding of 
functional problem involving the 
consideration of the difficulties 
arranging the composition to suit 
the plot, so as to conceive the lat­
est methods of the shipping and 
the receiving of raw materials.
The solutions that won honors 
were presented in a simple, direct 
and clear manner which was easy 
to understand and which showed 
intimate knowledge of the 
workings of such a plant.
James A. Mitchell of Pittsburgh 
received one of the three first 
medals awarded among the 265 
drawings submitted. These draw­
ings represented the greater num­
ber of architectural schools and 
ateliers in the United States and 
Canada. Mitchell’s contribution was 
excellent, showing a knowledge of 
circulation and plant functionalism. 
The other men receiving Second 
Medals were as follows: Carl ICiss- 
ling, of Pittsburgh; James Watson,

Y.M.C.A. CABINET 
MEETS THIS NOON
Freshman “Y” Cabinet to Be 
Organized Soon
The Y. M. C. A. Cabinet will hold 
its regular meeting today at 12:30 
in the Carnegie Inn. One of the 
important problems to be con­
sidered is the organizing of a 
Freshman "Y” Cabinet under John 
W. Ladd, the general cabinet yice 
president.
An attempt will be made to get 
a representative group of the first 
year men who are to be selected 
the basis of their interest in 
“Y” work. Any freshman inter­
ested should see Mr. Davis in the 
“Y” office as soon as possible.
The first freshman cabinet was 
organized on . the campus three 
years ago. Its members are trained, 
in “Y” work by being selected on 
sub-committees which aid senior 
cabinet members in • furthering the 
“Y” purpose on the campus. ' 
Each year a few of the members 
are rewarded for. their meritous 
work by being selected for the 
senior cabinet.
Another joint Y. M. and Y. W. 
C. A. Cabinet meeting will be held 
later this month. At this meeting 
reports will be heard from the stu­
dents who attended the Volunteer 
Conference at Buffalo and the Stu­
dent Federation Congress at Toledo.
Dr. C. E. Leberknight will ad­
dress the Phj'-sics colloquium on 
Tuesday, January 12, on the “Infra 
Absorbtion of Benzine in the Liquid, 
Solid and Vapor States.” His re­
port will summarize work which he 
did at Johns Hopkins University 
in the laboratory of Dr. A. Ii. Pfund.
The apparatus constructed by Dr. 
Leberknight had a greater resolv­
ing power than any previously used 
in this type of investigation, and 
made it possible to show that the 
absorbtion in the solid state is 
similar to that in the liquid state, 
but that absorbtion in the vapor 
state is of a different type.
Dr. Leberknight graduated in the. 
C. I. T. Physics Course in 1926. 
He was appointed to a teaching 
Fellowship at the University of Illi­
nois for 1926-27. He was instructor 
in Physics at C. I. T. from 1927 
to 1929 when he received his Mas­
ter of Science degree, in Physics. 
After two years as Junior instructor 
in Physics and Mathematics at. 
Johns Hopkins he received his 
Ph.D. degree there. Dr. Leber­
knight rejoined the Physics staff 
here last September.
Alan Scott Talks 
- On O’Neill Play
Alan Scott will address the stu­
dents in an open meeting tomorrow 
afternoon, January 13, at 4 o’clock 
in the Little Theater on Eugene 
O’Neill’s new play, “Mourning Be­
comes Elcctra.” This is a Theater 
Guild production which opens Mon­
day night, January lo, at the Nixon 
Theater.
Mr. Scott is an Oxford graduate 
and an authority on eighteenth cen­
tury drama. He has lectured in Eng­
land, and is finishing a book on the 
drama.
Mr. Kenyon of the Drama Depart­
ment has obtained the very great 
concession of $1 seats for 50c for 
the nights of Friday, January 22 and 
29. For tickets, see Mr. Kenyon as 
soon as possible in his office, Room 
104, College of Fine Arts.
Following the basketball game 
with New York University,. Friday 
night in the Gymnasium, there will 
be dancing in Thistle Hall from 9 
till 1 o’clock. This dance, tHc 
second basketball dance in the new 
student union, will be conducted 
under the recently revised plan of 
charging but one dollar for ad­
mission.
Jerry McGcorgc and his band, 
The Carnegians, a group which in­
cludes students from the schobl 
and has appeared at more school 
or fraternity functions than possi­
bly any other orchestra, will en­
tertain in the new dance hall.
The basketball game will prob­
ably conclude at about 9:30 and 
it will be possible to adjourn im­
mediately to Thistle Hall, passing 
through the newly formed en­
trance at the right of the stage at 
one end of the Gymnasium. Thd'se 
coming directly to the dance hall 
will find music available from ,9 
o’clock. The street entrance to 
the hall is parallel to the . Park 
Mansions drive, to the right of 
Skibo Inn. Complete checking 
facilities, a grill room serving re­
freshments, separate smoking rooms 
and parlors are- the facilities of 
the new unit, which opened offi­
cially last week with the Soph 
Hop.
The one request of the persons 
responsible for the upkeep and ap­
pearance of Thistle Hall is that 
smoking be carefully restricted to 
the lower floors and the smoking 
rooms. Their hope is that the 
room for dancing and the lobby 
be free from untidiness caused by smoking.
The plan of conducting basket­
ball danced will be continu'cft 
throughout the present season for 
such games as fall on Friday or. 
Saturday nights. The entire varsi­
ty squad and the head cheerleaders: 
are invited to ihese dances as guests. •

President Baker Describes Work of 
Carnegie in Recent Magazine Article
In the Decomber lumie of the Review of Review« In found a thoughtful yet lucid article, "Carncfcic Tech and It« Job,” by Dr. Tlioinn« S. Baker, which t lie Car­negie Tartan believe« would be of inter­est to the «Indent», faculty, and alumni of Cnrncfcio.
“Pittsburgh suggests industry—the 
application of science and engineer­
ing to manufacturing and construc­
tion. To many boys who are interest­
ed in machines, in popular science, 
it brings a. picture of a city where, 
engineering is practiced on a grand 
scale. A boy interested in electrical 
engineering thinks of it as the home 
of one of the great electrical manu­
facturing companies of the world. 
One interested in chemistry or metal­
lurgy knows of it as a steel center, 
and he may have heard that one 
of the coke oven plants of the 
United States Steel Corporation uses 
in normal times more than 30,000 
tons of coal a day. The Mononga- 
hela, the Allegheny, the Ohio—its 
great rivers — imply bridges, and 
every year sees huge new spans erect­
ed. These furnish opportunities for 
the civil engineer, while Pittsburgh’s 
importance as a railroad center de­
mands the services of additional large 
numbers of civil engineers. The me­
chanical engineers are at home 
everywhere—in the steel mills, in the 
glass plants, in the aluminum plants, 
in the power houses. Its coal mines 
require mining experts. In short,
Pittsburgh can be conceived of as a 
vast clinic for the student of engi­
neering who wishes to see in practice 
the principles that lie learns in. the 
classroom or in the laboratory. So 
there come to this city every year 
hundreds of young men, to study 
technology.
“It seems appropriate that the 
greatest of iron masters, Andrew 
Carnegie, should have endowed and 
established, in the city in which he 
did his most fruitful work, an in­
stitute for cultivating those branches 
of knowledge to which Pittsburgh is 
most deeply indebted for its com­
mercial greatness. The Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology is a monu­
ment to the foresight of its founder, 
who perceived that Pittsburgh in its 
industrial advancement would draw 
heavily on the resources of the scient­
ist and the research worker. The in­
stitute is an expression of his de­
sire to help young Americans and 
to serve the city in which it is 
located.
“No discussion of actual business 
conditions fails to make use of the 
expressions 'technological unemploy­
ment.’ There is an implication in 
this phrase of criticism of the engi­
neer—possibly of the scentist. He 
may have done his job too well. His 
machines are so large, so efficient, 
his labor-saving devices so complete, 
that, for the present at least, he has 
saved too much labor and there are 
several million pairs of idle hands 
in the country. I shall not under-

MORTAR BOARD 
SECURES TUTORS
Mortar Board, women’s senioi 
honorary society, has completed 
plans for conducting individual tu­
toring classes for girls taking 
freshman or sophomore subjects. 
The purpose of these classes is to 
prevent the necessity of many with­
drawals from school at the end of 
the first semester. Arrangements 
may be made for the classes by 
either calling or writing to Ruth 
Brooks, chairman of the committee 
in charge. j
Tutors in Accounting I and II, 
Chemistry I, History I, English I, 
Mathematics I, and Biology may be 
obtained at very nominal prices. 
In some cases, when a student is 
in very great need of help and un­
able to afford the tutoring classes, 
the Mortar Board will make ar­
rangements to give free lessons.
Anyone desiring tutoring in sub­
jects not mentioned above, regard­
less of the year, should get in 
touch with Ruth Brooks, and she 
will secure tutors.

PUBLISH RESULT 
OF STRAW VOTE
Favor Armament Reduction 
in Collegiate Poll
The results of the recent nation­
wide straw vote on disarmament, 
in which 24,345 students in 70 dif­
ferent colleges participated, have 
been announced by the Intercol­
legiate Disarmament Council and 
show a dccidcd sentiment for dis­
armament. Of those voting, 92 
per cent favored the reduction of 
armaments, and 63 per cent believed 
that the United States should set 
an example by beginning to disarm 
without waiting for other nations.
The poll shows also that one- 
third of the students favor 100 per 
cent cuts in armaments, provided 
that all nations agree to the same 
ratio, while one in seven advocate 
a 100 per cent cut for the United 
States without regard to other na­
tions.
Only 38 per cent favor the elimi­
nation of military training from 
colleges.

THETA TAU WILL 
HOLD MEETING
Prof. Daniels Elected Grand 
Outer Guard
An important meeting of the 
Carnegie Thcta Tau chapter will 
be held tomorrow evening at 8:30 
p. m. in Professor Daniels’ office, 
Room 2, Engineering Hall. Wil­
liam Iiagenlochcr', regent of Thcta 
Tau will present his report of the 
transactions at the convention in 
Fayetteville, Arkansas, which he 
attended with Professor Daniels 
during the Christmas vacation.- 
Further business will include the 
election of a treasurer and a corre­
sponding secretary, which offices 
arc at ’present open, and a discus­
sion of the several tentative proj­
ects which are now under consider­
ation but upon which no action has 
been taken. All members arc urg­
ed to be present, although pledges 
need not attend.
At the annual convention of 
Thcta Tau, national professional 
honorary engineering fraternity, 
held December 29, 1931, under the 
patronage of the Upsilon chapter 
at the University of Arkansas, 
Professor J. M. Daniels of the De­
partment of Civil Engineering of 
Carnegie, was elected Grand Outer 
Guard of Thcta Tau. Owing to 
the illness of former Grand Outer 
Guard, Ii. G. Hall, this office was 
left vacant. /
Ancient Greek Play is 
First Tragedy For 
Year
CAST IS ANNOUNCED
Play Has Been Produced 
Many Times As 
Classic
Beginning next Monday night, Jan­
uary IS, the Drama Department will 
present Euripcdcs’ tragedy, "Elcctra," 
according to th« Gilbert Murray 
translation. Mr. Murray’s beautiful 
translations have given a new lcaie 
of life to the Greek Drama among 
modern readers. By a happy co­
incidence, the famous Greek play is 
opening on the very night that 
Eugene O’Neill’s imitation of the 
Greek Drama will be shown for the 
first time at a local theater. The 
same theme was dealt with by every 
Greek writer of tragedy and marks 
one- important stage in the working 
out of the curse on the House of 
Atrcus. It is a drama of passionate 
feeling and noble characteristics with 
a psychology that strikes one as be­
ing very modern. Indeed, the eternal 
interest of the story is evident from 
the fact that the most intensely 
modern of dramatists, Eugene O’Neill, 
took it as a basis for his story of a 
New England family.
The stage life of "Elcctra” has 
been a history of two thousand years. 
Next year in New York, it will be 
presented by Blanche Yurka as 
Elcctra aiul Mrs. Pat Campbell, the 
distinguished English' actrcss, as 
Clytcmncstra, In France, the Greek 
plays arc given simply in the Roman 
theater jit Orange,
The production is being directed 
by Professor Chester, B. Wallace and 
is being staged in close harmony 
with the spirit of the Greek. The 
setting is a harmonious adaptation of 
the simplicity of the Greek back­
ground of a temple, while the place 
is neutral as in most Greek plays.
The members of the Drama De­
partment and their respective roles 
in "Elcctra" arc:
Elizabeth Drake as Elcctra; Donn 
Bonhoff as Orestes; George Hilder- 
brand as the Peasant; William Beale 
as an Old Man; Clytcmncstra is 
played by Olivia Kelly and Janet 
Feather; a messenger by Robert Gill 
and Thomas Gorman; Chorus con- 
(Continucd on Pago Three)
WOMEN SECRET 
ABOUT PUPPET
An atmosphere of sccrccy has ’ 
hovered about the Puppet office 
lately, and information has leaked 
out that it is all because of the 
special Co-cd Number of the Pup­
pet which will be on sale to­
morrow.
This is the first time that the 
women members of the staff have ' 
had -complete charge of the Co-cd 
Number, and according to reliable 
sources, they have been running 
things to suit themselves. Men 
members of the staff have been 
strictly forbidden to interfere with 
the editorial content of this issue.
The women editors will reveal 
nothing except that the students 
should prepare themselves for the 
best laughs of the year.
Manager Calls Issued
A call has been issued for fresh­
men basketball managers by the 
varsity and freshmen squad man­
agers. All freshmen interested 
should report at the gymnasium 
between 4:30 and 5 p. m. any after­
noon this week.
A freshmen managership is an 
activity which leads to varsity man­
agership in the student’s senior 
year. The varsity manager accom- 
panics the teaip on all trips and 
receives a letter at the completion 
of his term.

PAGE TWO' nTHE CARNEGIE TA HT ANTUESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1932.TARTAN SPORTS PAGE
WITH SIX OUT OF EIGHT GAMES to their crcdit, the 
Tartan five enters this wccli: with three tough games to play» 
each requiring the last ounce of ability to feed their fast grow- 
v» ing reputation.
Temple comes along Tuesday 
evening with their well-known 
collection of stars who have lost 
only to Pitt, defeating Colgate, 
C. C. N. Y., and three other col­
leges this season. At forward, 
JUIW co-captain, Gilbert Fitch leads the
l^rsf ^ ifiMrr il team with an average of twenty 
points per game. ; ,
Ed. Stentz’ will have a busy time with Leonard Gudd who 
measures six feet three inches, weighing 210 pounds. The im­
portance of this tip-off job was shown in the Thiel, game where 
the Skibos took the lead from their opponents after Stentz was 
placed in the center position. A reproduction of our Jimmie 
Leonard is found in the 128 pounds of Charlie O’Brian, guard 
for the Templeites.
N. Y. U. TOSSERS will receive their first real test in the 
Gym on Friday night. Their recent victory over Georgetown 
shows that they can win a ball game. The Violets doubled the 
score on a Plaid team two years ago, so the revenge has fer­
mented to sweetness.* * * # *
A SAMPLE-SIZED COURT AT GROVE CITY might 
cramp the Tartan’s style on Saturday, however, big things can 
be done in small places by competent parties. Grove City lost 
to Duquesne by two points, defeated Westminster by one point, 
and is now the favorite in the Tri-State Conference. A veteran 
team with good reserves has helped them to the front.sj< Sf< • J|< $
. W. & J's. FAR FAMED AND NOTED JINX may still 
be alive but its time for casting reflections upon the Carnegie 
campus is past. This fact was definitely decided in the first ten
minutes of the basketball game a week ago. The Plaid team
compiled so many points in a very short time that Coach Pete
Henry did not know which side of himself to sit on, or more 
politely said, “he was beside himself.”
Then, between the halves, there was our friend Doctor 
Carlson who gave a soulful portrait as he sat behind the press 
box, probably meditating over the fact that Carnegie used no 
orthodox attack’ in the first half. His bald spot reflected very 
little to the radio announcer, but we’re sure he had plenty to 
think about. However, the second half proved to be a good 
signal ’drill for Coach Hogan’s men, so the Pitt tutor ambled 
homeward with information to build a defense for our game on 
January SO.* * * *¦ *
SOMETHING DIFFERENT in the way of a basketball 
prevailed when Thiel took their 33 to 20 defeat. The Plaid drove 
a fast offense which, at times, seemed too fast for our green- 
shirted referees, while Thiel relied on a slow attack to loosen 
the Tartan defense.
Louie Jagnow, our maestro of ball deception, relieved the 
monotony with his tricks, and sandy-haired Angus, alias Red 
Fergus, added his timely shots. Evidently Stentz’s eye was in 
foul shape from his successful four out of four free throws.
* * * * *
PI/lvBH PASSERS are due for another win when they
meet Kiski in the Tuesday night preliminary wliich begins at 
7:16. They have a supply of ability that should carry them 
much further than their scores indicate to date. Their narrow 
victory over W. & J. Fro,all would have been more decided 
had they shown more accurate shooting.* * * if *
WEST VIRGINIA BOXERS will do a bit of road work 
next Saturday when they journey to the Tartan Gym for the 
first competition of the season, The opening gong.iB timed for 
8:15 p. m., students being admitted with the athletic book.
Coach Ernie Scsto has accomplished some fine results with­
in the several months of training. The entire squad is in shape, 
and the Mountaineers will pull in their cars when they meet 
some of the Tartan surprises. With the exception of two good 
men the visitors have much the same team that showed here 
last year. Their best bet is with Hawkins, in the heavy weight 
class.
A return match at Morgantown has been scheduled for the 
following Saturday, January 23.* * * . * *
UNDER COVER OF THE FORMAL FULL DRESS 
ATTIRE, Mr. Overend will lead the celebrities of the Car­
negie Athletic Assication into the ring-side seats on Saturday 
night. This august occasion marks the opening of Pittsburgh’s 
intercollegiate boxing season for 1932, and, from all accounts, 
the formality -will be comparable with that surrounding the 
entrance of Cox’s army. We’re waiting for that extra thrill of 
the evening when Doc Marks strolls in with his healthy share 
of whiteness before him.
But this tux privilege is also extended to the students who 
wish to follow the example of boxing enthusiasts who do things 
in the correct intercollegiate fashion. The formal dress goes 
a long way toward raising the moral and sportsmanship of the 
fistic battles inside the ropes. And incidentally, those wearing 
the white fronts will be given the choice seats in the house.

TARTANS READY FOR TEMPLE, N.Y.U.
Cagers Impress 
With Wins Over 
W-J and Thiel
Skibos Take Road Satur­
day for Joust With 
Grove City
Cilrncgie 'jTcch’s basketball machinc 
will throw the control lever to full 
speed ahead for the coming week, 
when they meet, two of the out­
standing teams of the cast and a 
strong Grove City team. The teams 
which the Tartans encounter arc 
Temple University, New York Uni­
versity, and Grove City. The first 
two games arc played at home, while 
the last one is away.
Tonight in the Gym, Coach Hogan 
and his players will have a contest 
on their hands that will be one of 
the toughest of the entire season, 
the Tartans meeting the strong 
Temple five. This is the same team 
that gave the Plaid the finest lacing 
thfy suffered last year when they 
ran up fifty-two points against Car­
negie, in Philadelphia. Temple’s team 
is entirely veteran, having lost by 
graduation only one man. On Tem­
ple’s team is a flashy little Irish­
man by the name of O’Brien, who 
rivals Jimmy Leonard in speed and 
dribbling skill. Filch, one of the out­
standing players of the cast last year 
and high scorcr for Temple, will be 
at forward. Although the Owls lost 
their first game of the season to 
Pitt, since then they have won six 
straight games. It is ccrlainly going 
to be one hectic night in the Car­
negie Gymnasium.
N. Y. U. Wins Two
New York University is the op­
ponent of the Tartans on Friday 
night in the Gym. Little is known 
this year about the strength of the 
New Yorkers but they always have 
a strong team, one that will give 
anyone a stiff battle. In their first 
game they nosed out Cornell by one 
point, then later defeated George­
town.
The last game of the. week, and 
possibly one of the mpst difficult, 
will be with Grove City. Grove City 
has a better than average team ^nd 
that coupled with the fact that the 
Plaid five/ will be tired from their 
other two hard engagements, and.will 
be pla3ting on a strange .floor, will 
tend to make the game very close. 
So far Grove City won one and 
lost one game. In their first en­
counter they were defeated by one 
point at the hands of Duquesne,. but 
bn Friday night they came back and 
defeated the formidable Westminister 
quintet.
Skibos Swamp W. & J.
Last week Carnegie continued play­
ing their line brand, of basketball 
and won two games, making it four 
straight victories hud six out of 
eight for the season. On Wednesday 
night Captain jimmy Leonard and 
his teammates romped tlieir way to 
a 59-24 victory over our old rivals 
from W. and .1. The Presidents 
were completely outclassed, never 
forcing the issue. In the first few 
minutes the Tartans ran up a twelve 
to one lead,
Local Talent Stars in 
Intramural 
Games
This week sees the beginning of 
the intramural sports this jrcar at 
Carnegie when the Intcriratcmity- 
Dormitory basketball leagues get away 
to their first contests. There is but 
little doubt that league standings 
will be close this year and the
spectators will witness not a few 
hard-fought contests.
A good many of the teams on the 
floor will contain identically, or near­
ly so, the same men as represented 
the fraternities and the dorms last
year, and''judging from the close 
games last year, this season’s con­
tests will be equal pr better. Already 
most of the squads have been put­
ting in more than their share of
practice in anticipation of a big sea­
son.
Last year saw Welch Hall capture 
the American League, Pi Kappa 
Alpha the National League, and 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon the Federal. 
With the exception of a few meet­
ings every game was exceptionally 
close to the very end, and in the 
Federal League a playoff was neces­
sary to decide the winner.
Welch Hall Wins
In the final playoffs Welch Hall 
defeated Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and 
then won the cup by taking across 
the strong Pi K. A. team. Later 
they copped the Inter-College title 
by defeating the winners of the

PLAID BOXERS OPEN SEASON 
WITH WEST VIRGINIA SATURDAY
A much improved and more con­
fident Tartan mitt squad will climb 
through the ropes for the season’s 
opener with West Virginia this 
Saturday night. This will mark 
the beginning of the second year 
of boxing at the Scotch scho6l, 
and the squad will face one of the 
toughest teams in the country for 
its opening assignment.
The seating arrangement has 
been materially improved this year, 
although any change might be con­
sidered an improvement' over that 
employed last year. The ring will 
be placed squarely in the middle of 
the. gym, and the scats -will sur­
round the ring in concentric cir­
cles. Another innovation will be 
the reservation of a formal section,' 
as* the ringside scats are to be 
set aside for those in formal attire. 
This is a custom observed at box­
ing matches at all leading Eastern 
schools.
Strengthened in nearly every po­
sition, the Skibo ringstcrs will en­
ter the fray as almost even choices 
to win. Remembering the two 
lacings administered by the Moun­
taineers last year, the squad will 
have' added incentive to send their 
opponents back to Morgantown 011 
the. short end of the score.
The Carnegie team will have an 
unusual array of experienced box­
ers for a' school at which the sport 
is comparatively young. This is 
especially true in the heavier
classes, where the Skibos will have 
such polished performers as Burke, 
Waldron and Croissant. Crois­
sant is a newcomer to the squad, 
but lie . has had considerable ex­
perience in prep school. Burke
aiid Waldron are old hands at 
the game, and Coach Scsto is 
banking 011 them to score victories
in an impressive way. Atlas,
Wertz and Carr, three classy boys 
from last year’s freshman squad, 
will receive their first opportunities 
to face varsity competition. These 
men fight in the 125, 115 and 145 
pound classes respectively. Hel- 
lcgcrs, a newcomer, will have the 
135 pound assignment.
Little is 'known about the West' 
Virginia team, but it is expected 
that they will be every bit as 
strong as they have been in the 
past.
An extra match with West Vir-
Pitt Interfraternity League and there­
by boosting their stock.
As inj the past all games except 
the finals will be pla}'ed on the end 
courts in the gymnasium. The tip- 
offs will be at 7:30 aiid S :30.

PLEBE BASKETEERS 
PLAY KISKI TEAM
Coach Nease’s yearling five will 
have to continue their good ball play­
ing if they arc to defeat Kiski and 
keep their clean slate spotless. Kiski 
has lost their first game by a three- 
point margin to the W. and J. Frosh.
Anyone who saw the Plebes vie 
with this same Presidential quintet 
will remember that it was a nip and 
tuck battle with the Carnegie lads 
only four points in the advantage 
as the game ended. The score was 
39 to 35. The close margin of the 
Plcbc’s win and Kiski’s loss point 
to a good battle with only a slight 
edge for the Skibos.
The Johnstown J. C. team gave 
the Plebes very little opposition, as 
the yearlings piled 1 up - 34 points 
against 14 for the visitors. The game 
gave Coach Ncasc a chance to put in 
two complete combinations. Bill Carl­
son still ran wild with his scoring, 
chalking up 11 points. Milim nailed 
7 more, and Ewalt came along with 
6.

gram for the coming year was 
planned.
Southern California Clan 
One of the most successful par­
ties ever sponsored by the Southern 
California Clan was held on Satur­
day . evening, December 5, at the 
Paris Inn. Nearly fifty members, 
their wives, and friends were pres­
ent. Much of the succcss of the 
party was due to the effort of the 
co-chairman, Charles Fleishman, E’21, 
and Jay Krapp, E’12.
The Clan is planning a stag party 
to be held in the near future. De­
tails for this will be announced later.
Golden Gate Clan 
The Golden Gate C- n which has 
been inactive for several years is 
making plans to reorganize and get 
together again in the near future. 
There arc many Carnegie Alumni in 
the vicinity of San Francisco who 
have never been members of the 
Clari, and it is hoped that these 
persons will get in touch with Mrs. 
Elizabeth Dearing Warton, M’17, 
3902 Clinton avenue, Richmond, Cali­
fornia. Mrs. Warton was the last 
active secretary of the Golden Gate 
Clan.
LADDER
Two Art School graduates, Nor­
man Foster and Harry, Hamilton 
’24, have collaborated recently on a 
play, "Savage Rhythm”, which is 
being presented in the John Golden 
Theater in New York.
Mr. Foster is well known as an 
actor on the stage and in moving 
pictures, but this is his first play 
to be presented on Broadway. It 
is also Mr. Hamilton’s premiere. 
The co-authors first met at Car­
negie where Hamilton wrote and 
Foster acted in, among many others, 
two one-act plays which were later 
to be combined as the basic ma­
terial for "Savage Rhythm”.
The play is a drama of Negro 
supcrstilution in the South. Its 
setting and much of its material 
was gathered by the' authors in 
Tennessee, Alabama, and the swamp 
lands of Mississippi.-
But the telephone 
conversation must not freeze
A sudden cold snap might seriously inter­
fere with long distance telephone service were 
it not for the studies made by Beil System 
engineers.
They found that temperature variations 
within 24 hours may make a ten-thousandfold 
difference in the amount of electrical energy 
transmitted over a New York-Chicago cable 
circuit! On such long circuits initial energy
is normally maintained by repeaters or ampli­
fiers, installed at regular intervals. So the 
engineers devised a regulator—operated by 
weather conditions—which automatically con­
trols these repeaters, keeping current always 
at exactly the right strength for proper voice 
transmission.
This example is typical of the interesting 
problems that go to make up telephone work.

VIRGINIA ARTZ
As a freshman last year, she
turned in the high score to 
win the beginners’ trophy.
A great deal is expected of Vir­
ginia Artz this year because of 
the splendid record she made last 
year. Besides • winning the begin­
ners’ trophy, Virginia turned in 
the third highest score of the year 
and competed in the National Rifle 
Association, winning a medal. Her 
scores this year indicate that she 
will be among the first five at the 
end of the season. More than • 
once since the opening of the sea­
son in November, Virginia has 
turned in perfect scores.
All in all the women’s rifle situ­
ation is quite bright, and we hope 
for a more successful season than 
last year. Tlie girls of the last 
year's varsity include Ruth Brooks, 
Floy Morrison, Leah Voegtly, 
Elizabeth Lilley and Virginia Artz. 
The Women’s Athletic Association 
urges these girls to do their best 
to put Carnegie Tech back in its 
rightful place in rifle circles.
The first match will be held the 
week ending January 30, with the 
University of Northwestern, Wash­
ington University, and the Univer­
sity of Nebraska. The first stage 
of the National' Rifle Association., 
match will also be shot. This, 
match includes .colleges and uni­
versities in all sections of the 
country.

“DELICIOUS”
A SOREEN TREAT OF A LIFETIME
Is Education A Handicap?
Have you ever experienced a 
desperate moment in life when the 
future looked dark and -dismal, 
when you felt that the world 
would not fccognizc your ability 
nor encourage your ambitions, and 
you wondered “if education is 
really useless and a handicap?
This question, which has been 
so often discussed and affirmed in 
the past by both the illiterate and 
learned skeptics, has again been 
raised, this time at a confercncc, 
of degree men, a group that would 
hardly be cxpcctcd to doubt the 
merits of a complete education.
It was stated at this confercncc 
that the most helpless people- in 
the world are the formally edu­
cated, and history was referred to 
as proof that the educated person 
always has been up against it in a 
crisis, and that the “peasant” was 
the one who survived.
Assuming from conclusions that 
in the vernacular of these sophisti­
cated gentlemen, “peasant” also re­
fers to those of us who are forced 
at an early age to discontinue 
our formal education to go out and 
shift for ourselves, resuming stud­
ies later at night when it ife neces­
sarily much prolonged in order to 
be thorough, then we should 
emerge with flying colors.
Ours is an education that is a 
slow and tedious proccss, inspired 
by the desire to attain a mark in 
the world that has already apprised 
us of the realism and practical side 
of life, and not a matter of con­
vention.
The value of a college degree 
when acquired merely for the pur­
pose of advertising one’s education 
has always been questionable, but 
when given as the stamp of thor­
ough training at the culmination 
of years of study through persever­
ance and self-sacrifice, it should 
prove an asset..
We have heard of eulogies over 
the biers of so callcd self-made 
men, attributing their success in 
life as due to their own resources 
without benefit of education, but 
logic discounts such assertions and 
the intelligent person who is about 
to prepare for life through the 
channels of education is not dis­
couraged. • E._
SERIOUSLY SPEAKING
(Continued from Page One) 
America which burst asunder in
October, 1929. Swdllcn with the reck­
less, nnti-social philosophy of in­
dividualism and profit-making, they
were ready to support a nation mad 
with the prospect of inflated stand­
ards of living.
The least one might expect is that 
banking, the most vital nerve cen­
ter of our highly complicated and in­
tricate economic system should be 
staffed withy highly trained, responsi­
ble men intent on security and the 
welfare of the people rather than
the chase the will-o-wisp of phan­
tom financial glory for themselves.
CONTEST CLOSING
DATE ANNOUNCED
Commitee Selects January 28 
As Closing Date For 
Entries
The contest to find that long dis­
tance Champ goes merrily on, but is 
rapidly drawing to a close with the 
Committee announcing Thursday, Jan­
uary 2S, as the closing date. That 
gives about two weeks to those 
procrastinating people J.o put in their 
nickel's worth and claim the dis­
tinction as thcir’s, together with all 
movie rights and royalties accruing 
thereto.
. The Committee has been swamped 
with entries for- this contest till 
they had to get a steam shovel, the 
one the kid brother got for Christ­
mas, to dig their way out. But they 
arc courageous, souls and will non­
chalantly continue keeping the best 
interests of the student body to the 
lore. Now all together—Bu,r,r,r,p.
This contest has so far been car­
ried..on in a jocular manner, but. let 
us get serious and say that we arc 
in earnest: The contest is a real one. 
We are very- anxious to; find out 
the student who makes such a per­
sonal sacrifice as to .'stand out above 
.all others and be justly callcd Car­
negie's long distance traveling night 
student. We know of nnny long dis­
tance travelers, but one of them has 
a right to feel proud of his achieve­
ments and the Plaid is greatly in­
terested in this person. The response 
made so far is indeed gratifying but 
w.c feel that there are still others to 
be heard from before we officially 
declare a champion.
Just address your letter to the 
News Editor of the Plaid, stating 
the number of miles traveled each 
evening and the total number travel­
ed per week, together with the eve­
nings' spent on the Campus. S.

Joint Award Given 
Professor, Pupil 
For Book Essays
A distinctive honor was given to 
Carnegie Tcch last month when a 
prize of one hundred dollars was joint­
ly awarded • to Professor Porter 
Garnett of Pittsburgh and Francis 
P. Dill of Roselle Park, N.J., for 
the best essay upon the subject, 
“The Ideal Book.” Two hundred 
essays were submitted to the Lim­
ited Editions Club before Decem­
ber first, the final date for accept­
ance of essays in the club’s con­
test to determine the best essay on 
this subject.
Porter Garnett is Master of the 
Laboratory Press of Carnegie 
Tech, teaching the younger men 
the proper methods to be used in 
printing fine books, and Francis P. 
Dill, formerly a student at the 
New York University School of 
Graphic Arts, is now. a student 
here. It is an interesting coinci­
dence that, out of a. group of com­
peting ‘ essays received from so 
many quarters, the two essays 
which jointly won the prize were 
written by a teacher and a pupil in 
one city. Honorable mention was 
given to Edward K. Robinson of 
Boston.
The essays upon “The Ideal 
Book” written by Mr. Garnett and 
by Mr. Dill are being printed in 
pamphlet form for distribution to 
the members of the Limited Edi­
tions Club as a Christmas gift 
from the directors of the club. 
Those who arc interested in the 
subject can obtain copies of this 
booklet by applying to the Limited 
Editions Club, 55). Fifth Avenue

DIED
Charlotte Weiss, a sopho­
more, registered in Social 
work in Margaret Morrison 
College, died suddenly last 
Saturday at her home, 1029 
Dufficld Street, Pittsburgh. 
She was a holder of a foun­
der’s scholarship and was ac­

tivities of her class.
Pocketbook Lost
A black pockctboolc was lost 
near the campus some time Fri­
day afternoon, January 8. Con­
tained papers with the name of 
the owner. If found, please return 
to Bill Dilks, 5549 Forbcst Street, 
Phone Schenley 1490. Reward of­fered.
Over in Schenley Park they have 
built a scaffold on the top of what 
appears to be one of the salons 
which house the art exhibitions. I 
wonder if the “prize” picture of 
this year’s International took wings 
and * flew through the roof. It 
docs seem funny to see the top 
all boarded up. Some speculation 
has been aroused in my mind as 
to what they are doing there and 
if they arc changing the form of 
decoration. It used to be that 
there was a replica—a dollar word 
—of the world on the top. It may 
be that they got tired of holding 
the world up so they will change 
to some other form of decora­
tion. We shall see.
I noticed the. lack of bell ring­
ing at the end of the class periods 
recently and am speculating -there 
you are, got me going again—if 
the electricians have gone on^ strike 
or if they have run out of juice— 
grape juice. It is mighty incon­
venient not to have the bells ring 
proclaiming the termination of 
periods, especially if they are in 
classes in which you are so ab­
sorbed with the subject matter that 
you wished you were in New York 
or San Francisco rather than in 
Math. But that’s the way of 
school; nothing seems to be right. 
If it isn’t one thing it’s another. 
However, I vote for having the 
bells ring regularly at all times 
and in all buildings, and if they 
don’t, well, then the "elecs” better 
look out.
*****
Which brings, me to another sub­
ject which has to do with power 
also. That is the constant blink­
ing of .lights. Sometimes they arc 
off for a few seconds, and then 
again they may be off for five or 
ten - minutes. Who knows, exccpt 
those who arc moifkcying with the 
juU;c. or the ' switches, what the 
c/u'se is?, It’ is mighty inconvenient 
to have the lfifc go out, espe­
cially when you are putting the 
finishing touches on an art object, 
or watching the final result of an 
experiment. Now don’t say it is 
the main switch, because the load 
should not be too heavy _ as the 
flame in the tower of Engineering 
Hall has been dark since opening 
night of school, many, many weeks 
ago.
I hardly know what to think 
about the large number of absences 
which I have noticed recently in 
the classrooms. Maybe those stu­
dents who failed to return last 
week forgot that the Christmas 
holiday season was over—following 
my example—they want to be idle. 
Don’t do it. I tried and failed. I 
have so many assignments now 
that I am going to employ a sec­
retary to do all my work, even 
writing my English themes and 
hand them in with the silent com­
ment to myself—I could do better 
than she did—there you are— 
gratitude. Wtll, that’s the way of 
humans. The willing horse soon 
will be loaded up with all he can 
carry and .the driver will sit back 
with a merry ha! hal take all the 
credit and criticize. Believe it or 
not, I have been criticised for be­
ing idle. But then, who cares.
Nu Sigma Alpha to 
Initiate Pledges Jan.30
Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity will 
hold an initiation on January 30 to 
induct all those men into the or­
ganization who were issued a call 
for membership at the Anniversary 
Dinner Dance held December 26 
last. Pledges have received- instruc­
tion. and the. final hour rapidly ap­
proaches fpr compliance. These men 
can be distinguished by the little red 
and black pledge button which they 
are wearing, and which they will 
exchange for the regulation mem­
bership key after they successfully 
past the rigors of the initiation on 
the 30th of January.

Taking Stock of
Class Attendance
POST HOLIDAY DANCE 
TO BE HELD IN GYM.
Committee Promises a Succès- 
fui Party on the 23rd
The holiday season has come to a 
close. Once more we must all set­
tle down and try to , recall all that 
has been-forgotten during the vaca­
tion days. Just around the corner 
are the examinations, days of cram­
ming and fact-gathering. But in the 
midst of • all the hurry and bustle 
comcs a respite, the Post-Holiday 
Dance.
This is the first dance of the new 
year. While you have been taking 
it easy the committee has had to 
think of having another dance to 
which book-weary students can come 
and forget themselves for an eve­
ning. Plans have been aired and 
orchestras talked over, and on 
Saturday, January 23, the Gym­
nasium will open its doors and in­
vite all to attend a bigger and bet­
ter dance, the.first.in the new j'car.
There will be no advance in 
prices. Tickets arc now on sale by 
night students everywhere on the 
campus. Better sec one of them and 
get your ticket. Bring your friends 
if you like, they will have a good 
time. In the next issue of the Tar­
tan, the Plaid will have more on the 
function for publication. So remem­
ber, for a good time and an evening 
well spent, but a ticket and come to 
this event.
C.
Recreation
At this time of the school term 
one is tempted to take an inventory 
of the vacant places in the various 
class rooms. In almost every de­
partment there are numerous scats 
unoccupied now by the students who 
formerly occupied them. Why this 
condition exists is perhaps due to 
variou. causes, some of them justi­
fiable no doubt, but most of them 
cannot be explained on a satisfactory 
basis.
When one takes into consideration 
that the night student has paid the 
tuition fee for the full night term, 
two semesters, it docs seem strange 
that there should be a willingness on 
the part of the student to forfeit this 
fee by non-attendance at classes.
Is the ever growing unemploy­
ment problem the cause for some of 
the falling off? If so, is this justi­
fiable? The answer should be no. 
From a sound economic basis, it 
would be a mistake to discontinue 
the course of studies the student 
registered for. The* interest in the 
subjects should not lagging, but 
rather, stimulated and more time 
could, no doubt, be given to the 
studies.
Is the falling off due to lack of 
interest because of difficulty in grasp­
ing the subject? If it is, then the 
student should; have a talk with the 
instructor and find out the cause for 
the difficulty. Many a student has 
.been helped by a heart-to-heart talk 
with the instructor in chargc of his 
class and in many eases the difficulty 
has been overcome to the benefit of 
all concerned. The student will find 
tjic instructor always willing and 
glad to help him.
Is the course of study unsuitcd 
to the individual needs of the stu­
dent? In this, case, then the student 
should see the head of his depart­
ment for some advice and perhaps 
a satisfactory adjustment fcould be 
made without loss to anyone.
Whatever the cause may be,"there 
should, except in rare cases, be no 
forfeiture of tuition fee on account 
of non-attendance at classes. The 
absentee should take stock of his 
particular problem and sec wherein 
the difficulty is,, and then resolve' to 
correct this condition. Let us see 
what can be done to - increase the 
attendance at classes.
Greetings, Dean Tarbell
The Plaid regrets to learn that 
Dean Tarbell is ill. A 'speedy re­
covery is the wish of all the staff 
and we are sure that the night 
student body join us in this wish. 
May you be back on the campus 
soon, Dean.
Thanksgiving Recess Dance 
Returns Coming in Slowly
There are still returns to be made 
for the Thanksgiving Recess Dance 
Tickets. It would be appreciated if 
those students who have not made 
returns would do so promptly. Re­
turns to be made to Henry E. 
Mauro, Treasurer, Night Student 
Council, Box 137, C. I. T. Schen- 
ley Park, Pittsburgh, Pa.
The Night Student Council pro­
vides the night student body with- 
several functions wherewith to amuse 
themselves throughout the year. 
These functions help a great deal in 
relieving, to a -certain degree, the 
mental strain occasioned by our 
studies. However, most of us feel 
the need for other recreation, such as 
—well, that’s a private matter, any­way.
Too many of us, unfortunately, 
have the urge to recreate, without 
the necessary equilibrium of mind 
which would enable us to balance 
work with play. This doesn’t neces­
sarily imply mental weakness. Rather, 
it is an expression of a perfectly 
human, moral weakness.
It is only natural that we should 
make such a mistake as this,' if it 
really is a mistake. It doesn't re­
quire the brain of a superman to 
discover that one. enjoys a date 
more than, for instance, a class in 
mathematics. Neither does it require 
a superior mentality to realize why. 
In fact, it requires much less'“grey 
matter’’ to sec the advantages in en­
joying ourselves over the advantages 
attendant to an education.
Of course, many! of the men who 
exhibit this failing look at the^ ques­
tion from this angle. If we stick 
strictly to studies until sufficient 
financial good comes from them to 
enable us to “go places,” we will 
(most of us at least) be past the 
stage at which simple methods of 
enjoying ourselves arc effective. In 
other words, we will be old. On 
the other hand, if we let school work 
slide in favor of good times, we will 
probably never become "rich and 
famous” (in the movies they do it). 
Nevertheless, by following the last 
plan we will probably get more out 
of life; in a less intellectual way 
than our more studious fellows, per­
haps, but more.
So it’s a matter „of choice. Study, 
possibly get prematurely old in our 
manner of existence, and have a 
good chance to succeed, or, absorb 
such knowledge as we can on the 
fhy enjoy ourselves thoroughly now, 
and die happy though broke.

Four Years Accomplishes What?
Is the average graduate of an engineering course at 
Carnegie properly prepared for adjusting his technical 
knoweldge to the social and economic life of a modern 
society—or is he merely a technician, empowered to conquer 
nature, yet unable to comprehend the world into which he 
is thrust?
In his four years of training the engineer receives at 
the most but a few short lectures calculated to give him 
an understanding of political science and existing finance. 
Knowledge of world wide social problems, understanding 
of distribution as well as production, education to the recog­
nized valued arts—all are passed over because of crowded 
schedules and left for outside reading.
The ordinary possibilities for beneficial reading are 
practically excluded from the engineer’s program. Perhaps 
if time should permit the student’s reading would go fur­
ther and supplement his classroom work in a more posi­
tive manner than at present. The average student in engi­
neering at Carnegie rarely gets beyond the Collier’s or 
Liberty magazine to which he turns first for some relaxa­
tion !
In the matter of English and public speaking the engi­
neering student is notoriously poor. In the former course, 
lack of proper emphasis by the student, who as a freshman 
is anxious to avoid a subject which he has been meeting 
ever since fourth grade, often coupled with mediocre in­
struction, makes its one year of study rather ineffective. 
Public speaking for engineers has 3ret to secure a place in 
the schedule.
Dr. Iiibben, for twenty years president of Princeton, 
says: “More and more it has become evident that these
days are days of specialization, but this very specialization 
brings with it a danger that the student may become nar­
row in his learning.—Today education has to a certain de­
gree become a,problem of stressing some subjects without 
neglecting others.
“I think I can say that the essential objective of a col­
lege education today is the development in the individual 
student of his potential capacity, evidenced by a growing 
intellectual vigor and integrity of character. I do not think 
that this potential element can ever be developed to the full 
in four years of a college course.”
In the opinion of Mr. Benclred, editor of a London pub­
lication: “We are convinced that to the engineer all things 
are possible. Yet the reason for the prevailing disorder 
and depression is because this very advance is made with 
less thought and understanding than ever before.”
Interest, in college training and especially engineering 
is growing at Carnegie, as told by President Baker in a re­
cent article—the average age of graduates has decreased, 
permitting an addition of several years to a college course 
without hardship to the individual—the need is evident; 
why therefore should Carnegie not establish the six-year 
course and give its students the training that at present 
they must struggle to secure through experience? K.* * * *
Opening Thistle Hall
Last Friday night six hundred people were present at 
the opening of a new hall at Carnegie, built by the adminis­
tration solely for use by the student body in conducting its
social functions. Building such a hall, as complete and
modern as a private club, at Carnegie would scarcely have 
seemed probable a few years ago, and even today is con­
sidered unusual by schools with an administration lacking 
the same forsight.
To the persons who conceived the idea, to the admin­
istration that backed it, and to Mr. Orbin who is responsible 
for obtaining for the hall its many and interesting features, 
and who was actively engaged in securing it for the stu­
dents, we extend our sincere thanks.* * * *
About the Boxing Match
Last year the inauguration of boxing as an intercol­
legiate sport at Carnegie was completely successful. The 
students enthusiastically welcomed the new and interesting 
sport. They were also quick to appreciate the difference 
between boxing as staged and witnessed by a college group, 
and the public exhibitions of the same sport. Attendance 
was large but orderly, and cheering restricted to time out 
periods, rather than during the actual rounds, as is cus­
tomary.
This year an additional step is being taken to bring to 
the sport the social prestige it merits by inviting as many 
as can of those attending to come in formal attire. This 
plan is quite successful throughout the country where box­
ing has been in vogue for some time, and could be readily 
adopted at Carnegie. Such customs will aid considerably 
in bringing to this campus the air of dignity and prestige 
enjoyed by most older colleges.
There are but three home matches by the boxing team 
this year, and each nearly a month apart. Let us lend sup­
port to a move which will prove an asset to our school as 
it grows older.

1R Thuxslc-H'll!
What a Hop!—
Mr. Orbin & Co. surely have"made good; Mere words are quite inadequate to- describe the-exotic w?onders of our new Thistle Hall. ' The modernistic 
plan and furnishings would do .honor to. the New Yorker. We feared that the rathskeller might take advantage of their monopoly but no, soft drinks are only a nickel. And what a smoking room! The setting was slightly marred however by some peo­ple who parked their wraps on 'the furniture. And say, the lighting effects in the Hall!' What could be nicer than the multicolored haze effect that, they had? Even a tent over the orchestra! A place like Thistle Hall is just what the school needed to keep functions on the campus.. The students -would rather have their functions in Thistle Hall because no other ballroom in the. city can hold a candle to it for attractiveness, bar none . . . Nice leather programs such as wcre.given out at the Hop surely made an ideal memo of the dance and favors are not missed. Why can’t that be worked'at all the dances? . . . What a relief to .have a decent amount of room even with a record Tech crowd! A high ceiling makes the place .about .five hundred per cent airier than the old stuffy Union. The Union is dead; long live Thistle Hall! . . . Congratulations Sophs! To you too, Mr. Brockman! And to all who had any­thing to do with our very elegant Thistle Hall and a very success­ful Soph Hop! ... And who w'asthere? Prac­tically every­body. Among the Ex-Techs were the charming Mrs. Henrietta Accipiter Parker, Frank (From-the-Fcnce) Foote, Betty (Campus Queen) Steele, Peg (P. & D.) StulstrUm, Alice Mac Long doing- spins, Novclda ’Noderer, Ted Roseriz- weig and others. And of our austere faculty, Doc­tor and Missus Neelley having as much fun as any­one, and Mister Gabler ducking.here and there. In the gloom we spied Ann Warden, Mary Husband, Editor-in-Chief Kplb, Marj Dougherty, . Roy .- Gilli­land, Mary. McKeon, Joe Nagle, Ed Stentz, Jean Shirk, Ginny Artz, Mary Boucherle, Oscar .Parsons, Esther Hanley, W. Wigton, Marion McNary, Stelle Dana, Peg Kunkle, Kitty Lou Jessop, Jean Darsie, Betty Schum, Dolly Allison, Harvey Collins, Will (Willard) Holloway, Toots Baily, Fran Snyder and goodness knows who all. Everyone having more fun! . . . Miles Ki'nley doing a marathon dance all 
over, the floor. Hal Brennan very;graciously accepted the Hall from, the Administration which was pres­ent by proxy.. During Hal’s, speech some very clever wit (?) loudly and crudely remarked “louder and funnier.” Suh, we resent that, there are- Gen­tlemen present! Such people should be promptly shown the outside of the door.' . . The Sigma Nus’ had .to have their little stomp (a very graceful lit­tle gavotte, to say the least) . Hope they stonip their way thru to the pool some fine day. . . . And to make a perfect aftermath to a fine dance there
’was actually instantaneous scrvice at the check room (by the courtesy of Horning and Webster). It's a grand idea, how about keeping it up?, . . , * * * *
What Next?—
Next on the program is the opening boxing match with the Mountaineers. And what do you think, formal dress is “the thing” ^ for boxing matches! The ringside seats will be reserved for those in formal dress. The idea is to definitely raise intercollcgiatc boxing above the level of pro­fessional fighting. It sounds great. We’ll be there formal! How' about you, and you? O. K., let’s go! by the way let’s cut out booing the officials such as occurred at the last basketball game. . . . Sam Bond and Bert Travis acquired a cute little foot and a half long alligator and kept him (maybe her) housed in a drawer in the TX house and fed it goldfish. With the able assistance of Edna Pearson they scoured downtown for a more aesthetic home for the beastic and finally chose a handsome dishpan. They arc planning a spe­cial dinner for the alligator’s birthday. Have -you any suggestions? We might furnish a few nice fat roaches . . . Kenneth Yost, Plcbc P. &.D., who had the luck to conceive of the name Thistle Hall was caused no little embarrassment by his publicity agent who obtained the spelling of the name from the almost perfect Directory where he is labeled as Ycrt. . , .

Mechanical. Engineers today in Room 
10, Machinery Hall at 2:30, as a 
continuation of a series of lectures 
on photo-elasticity. His lccturcs in­
clude reviews of original researches 
which , he previously presented before 
the; convention of- mechanical .engi­
neers in New York this fall.
Photo-clastidty . is concerned with 
the. study . of the. location and meas­

O’NEILL’S PLAY* “Mourning Becomes Electra”
Editor’s Note: The Tnrtan feels that itwill be of interest and of benefit to its renders to present in its columns, prc-. views and interesting bits of. information regarding the occasional plays of merit that come to the legitimate stage fn this city. In the first of these articles Mr. Kenyon diBcussea Eugene O'Neil’s new play, "Mourning Bocombo Electra,” whichi opens at the. Nixon soon.. Mr. Kenyon is head of the Drnma Department at Carnegie and president of the Drama League of Pitts­burgh. He hns written the play reviews for the Drama League for the past ton years,, and enjoys wide recognition ns a critic.
rk UnNiv eiskos
The presentation of Eugene 
O’Neill’s “Mourning Becomes Electra” 
at the Nixon Theater for two weeks, 
beginning January 18, is an event of 
major importance. Though there had 
been no doubt of his pre-eminence as 
the greatest American playwright, 
this drama has increased his' import­
ance immeasurably and imparted to 
the theater of our day a recovered 
seriousness that distinguishes dra­
matic art at its best.
As is well known by now, O’Neill 
composed this trilogy—"The Home­
coming,” , “The Hunted” and "The. 
Haunted”—with the idea of using 
as the basis of a tragedy in modern 
terms the outline of the story told 
by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides 
in their dramas about the House of 
Atreus. His Lavinia, as the title 
suggests, is a latter-day' Electra., Her 
father, Brigadier-General Ezra Manr 
non,. is returning from the- Civil, War 
as Agamemnon long ago returned 
from the war at Troy. His wife, 
Christine is another. Clytemnestra, 
her Aegisthus being a mariner; Adam
Brant. Lavinia’s brother, Orin, is 
recognized at once as Orestes. And 
just as Clytemnestra bore resent­
ment against her husband, Agamcm- 
.non, for sacrificing their daughter, 
Iphigcnia, so Christine hates General 
Mannon for having thrust into the 
war their son, Orin.
In place of the Greek temple be­
fore which ancient tragedies were 
enacted, the setting chosen by O’Neill 
and admirably executed by Robert 
Edmond Jones is the facade of a 
Colonial house in a sea-port town of 
New England. Actually, it is a re­
production of a well-known house in 
New Bedford, Mass. The portico 
with its columns suggests dignity, but 
th? dark . color where all should 
be .white is ominous, forebodings arc 
soon confirmed by tlie words of the 
gardener, Seth, who serves the play 
like a Greek chorus.
The action, like that of a Greek 
tragedy, is a direct outgrowth of 
-the past; therefore, O’Neill, in the 
manner of 1 Sophocles, marshals the 
retrospective method, tearing veils 
one by one from present motives to 
satisfy aroused curiosity over ante­
cedent ‘ causes. These causes arc 
fOtmd to constitute the equivalent of 
the Curse on the House of Atreus 
which gave an air of doom to the 
ancient theater. The Curse on the 
House of Mannon was not hurled, 
however, by a god but fashioned by 
•the character of an ancestral Man- 
nor whose weakness before life he

take a defense of the engineer nor 
a discussion of technological unem­
ployment, its causes or its remedy. 
It will find a cure some day and in 
some way. I am asked what- effect 
has technological unemployment and 
the present hard times had upon the" 
disposition of young men to study- 
engineering. Has some of the glamor 
disappeared from the engineer’s 
career, because of the technical spe­
cialists who are "le? Has . the ap.- 
parent over-supply reduced- the - num­
ber of candidates for this profes­sion?
“My answer, based on the enroll­
ment at the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, must be ‘No.’ There has 
been a small but steady increase in 
the student body of this institution 
during the past ten years, which has 
not been checked by the business crisis.
Comments on Coal
"Officers of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, in their efforts to 
serve Pittsburgh, have given special 
thought to the study of metallurgy, 
and coal. We recognize that Pitts­
burgh could not have been the Iron 
City had it not been able to build, 
upon the foundation of coal. Metal­
lurgy has been until recently an 
empirical science. Modern 1 atomic 
physics is just beginning, to . find-an 
entrance into the metallurgist’s work­
shop, and so a research laboratory 
which would be devoted- to theoreti­
cal problems of the behavior of 
metals was established, here seven 
years ago. Important results have 
already been accomplished, especially 
in the study of the alloys of iron,
manganese, and carbon and of cor- 
rosion-resistant iron alloys.
“The Metallurgical Advisory Board 
of the. Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology/ in«' co-operation with ,the 
United States Bureau of Mines at 
Pittsburgh, has been engaged on a 
five-year program of research on the 
physical chemistry of steel making. 
The three outstanding, contributions 
from this work are: development of 
a new manganese-silicon deoxidizer, 
which has-been shown to be superior 
to ferromanganese ferrosilicon in 
combination in producing clean steel 
at a low cost; development of a 
method for quantitatively determin­
ing non-metallic inclurions in plain- 
carbon steels, and determination of 
the factors which affect the oxida­
tion, of steel in the open hearth 
furnace.
"The graduate department of metal­
lurgy is one of the most consider­
able in the United States.
Carnegie's College of Fine Arts
“In the realistic, materialistic, at­
mosphere of Pittsburgh it may seem 
remarkable that an institute of tech­
nology - should embrace a school of 
fine arts. But it. docs. At first sight 
the joining of students of painting, 
sculpture, the drama, and music, with 
engineering students may seem in­
appropriate. But, why not? Architec­
ture frequently finds a place in an 
engineering - school. The daring of 
my predecessor, President Hamer- 
schlag, in attempting- this union is 
unquestionable. But the results have 
fully justified his courage. The 
young engineers have not been re­
tarded in their studies by the pres­
ence on the campus of a group of
transmitted in the family heritage. 
In short, O'Neill substitutes for the 
Fate of the Greeks the tenacious 
tendencies in heredity insisted upon 
by certain/ modern psychologists. 
The story of the play is Greek only 
externally; internally,', the characters 
arc probed in a strictly contemporary 
manner. Needless to say, they arc 
intense, complex and grow increas­
ingly abnormal.
The tact of the Theater Guild in 
the staging of this impressive drama 
notably meets the challenge of the 
dramatist. Both notably succeed in 
making the evening at the three plays 
—beginning at five-thirty o’clock—a 
memorable experience.

jeetions were discussed at a meet­
ing at the Alpha Tau Omega 
house. About half of the members 
were opposed to another rushing 
season of the same duration. How­
ever, no definite decision was made 
regarding the discussion.. The In- 
tcrfratcrnity Council is at present 
investigating the systems of rush­
ing practiced in other colleges.
CARNEGIE KATE SAYS:
How about rechristening the new­est local radio station WCIT and broadcasting some of the 8:30 lec­tures so the boys can sleep in peace?
young people who hope to bccome 
artists, while the practical-minded 
engineers have not checked the ideal­
ism of tlie artist. Pittsburgh, because 
of the Carnegie Institute’s perinamcnt 
collection of pictures, and because 
of the annual International Exhibi' 
tion, is becoming an art center.
Conclusion 
“The policy of the Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology has been definite, 
It has wished to serve the great in­
dustrial community in which it - is 
located in the belief that in so do­
ing it would best serve the cause 
of science and art and education. 
It has aimed to give to the industrial 
life of the city a background of 
pure research, Pittsburgh’s greatness 
is due in a large measure to the ap­
plications of science. And as we con­
tribute to the sum total of scientific 
knowledge, our institution is not only 
helping its neighbors, but the whole 
world.”
CLUB NOTES
NEWMAN CLUB

and prominence' in activities.
INTERCOLLEGIATE CLIPS
A course has been added to the 
curriculum at the .UNIVERSITY 
OF PARIS on the "Appreciation 
of Rare Wines and Liquors.” Just 
how might a course of that nature 
be conducted?
An instructor in psychology at 
the UNIVERSITY OF DETROIT 
is quoted as saying that "College 
students might as well be' given 
hot dogs as diplomas when they 
graduate from college, for at least 
they can cat the hot dogs, but they 
can do nothing with the diplomas.”
A recent canvass of the campus 
of WASHINGTON AND LEE 
UNIVERSITY reveals that the 
majority of the student body favor 
the abolition of the Thanksgiving 
vacation and the addition of the 
holidays to the Easter vacation.
At BRADLEY TECH the fra­
ternity brothers of one student re­
quested that his love letters be 
mimeographed so that they could 
use them as models.
A professor at .OBERLIN Col 
lege invited 120 students to an
eight course dinner, the basis of 
which was whole wheat. The din­
ner cost three cents a plate.
One of the big social events of 
the year at MUSKINGUM is the 
annual "kid party.” "London 
Bridge” is falling down and the 
"Farmer in the Dell” were played. 
Animal crackers, orangeade, and 
lolly-pops were served.
The mailing list of the TEMPLE 
UNIVERSITY publications includes 
Lindbergh, Mussolini, Calvin Coo- 
lidgc, and Mahatma Gandhi.
The weekly phonograph concert 
at RUTGERS UNIVERSITY had 
to be called off because someone 
took the needles. As a result the 
largest group ever to attend had 
to be turned away.
Three blond co-eds at WITTEN­
BERG UNIVERSITY recently de­
bated with three dark-haired girls 
from the same institution on the 
subject that brunettes were more 
intelligent than blondes and lost by 
a vote of 47-28. Gentlemen still 
prefer blondes.
Model Disarmament Conference
An Intercollcgiatc Model Dis­
armament Conference was held at 
the University of Pittsburgh, Janu­
ary 8, 9 and 10. Delegations were 
present from ten colleges in the dis­
trict. Procedure was modelled after 
that of the conference to be held in 
Geneva, February 2.
Registration and an agenda com­
mittee meeting preceded a banquet 
held in Heinz House on Friday eve­
ning. Following the banquet Mr. 
Corbett spoke on "Disarmament and 
tlie World Crisis,” emphasizing his 
belief that the old era is over, and 
a new one waiting, to be born. Cor­
bett stated that unrest is prevalent 
all over Europe, particularly among 
the students; that nationalism is 
now at its peak; and that psycho­
logical disarmament, to get rid of the 
suspicion and hatred that hits been 
fostered between nations, is neces­
sary before actual physical dis­
armament can take place. Comple­
mentary to these assertions were 
those of Tucker Smith in his speech 
"Breaking the War Habit,” in which 
he pointed out that "all nations arc 
now following all the policies that 
started the World War,” and that 
"it is impossible to leach peace while 
preparing for war.” It is true that 
world prosperity depends upon com­
merce and international trade, and 
"the only method of protecting for­
eign trade against war is by prevent­
ing war."
OXFORD CLUB
Alan Bright, registrar of Carnegie 
Tech, .will speak to the Oxford 
Club on Sunday evening, January 17, 
at 6:45. Mr. Bright always has 
something worth hearing, and his ap­
pearance at the 'Chib is anticipated.1 
each year- by its members.
The Oxford Club is an organiza­
tion of' Methodist students in the 
various educational institutions of this 
district. An • invitation to bccome a 
member of this group, which meets 
Weekly .' to discuss religious and so­
cial problems of our day, is ex­
tended to all who may wish to at­
tend its meetings.
GREEK FRATERNITY
Twenty Greek students of Carnegie 
Tech, Pitt- and Duqucsne tentatively 
organized Sigma Epsilon Phi, a. new 
fraternity, at a meeting in the St. 
Nicholas. church, Forbes and Dith- 
ridge, streets, last , week: The f ra­
ternity will protfde a social outlet 
for. students of Greek parentage at 
the three schools, according to the 
Preamble oi the Constitution adopted 
at the meeting.
George Gianakes, Duqucsne ’32, 
has been elected temporary chairman 
of the fraternity and George Anto- 
nopoulos, ,Pitt '32, is temporarily 
acting as secretary, The committee 
for housing will give its report at 
the next meeting .which will be held 
this evening at the St. Nicholas 
church. .The committee will lease a 
house centrally located . among the 
three, schools.
The fraternity will play a benefit 
basketball, game, against the combined 
G. A. P. A. Jrs. and Ahcpa Jrs. 
on Thursday, January 21, in the 
Schcnley High School Gymn. Ad­
mission is twenty-five ccnts, arid the 
proceeds will go , towards building 
up the treasury of the fraternity.
The group will petition Student 
Relations Committee, shortly.'
PI DELTA EPSILON
A meeting of the Carnegie chapter 
of Pi Delta Epsilon, men’s journal­
istic fraternity, will be held next 
Tuc:day evening at 9:15 in the "Y” 
club room. Plans arc to be dis­
cussed then for a journalistic con­
test to be conducted among the high 
schools of this section of the state.
The inevitable question conccrning 
the "situation in Manchuria” was an­
swered by Mr. Corbett. He asserted 
that the disturbance is “a struggle 
between two groups in Japan” and 
that it was started by a "sccrct or­
ganization of young officers in the 
Japanese army who felt that the at­
titude of China toward Japan and 
Manchuria was wrong;” lie claimed 
that "bayonets will not force cus­
tomers to buy;” and that "Japan has 
certainly 'spilled the beans.’ ”
"How Can the United States Dis­
arm and be Pcrparcd for- Defense’' 
was Tuckcr Smith’s subject, on. 
which lie remarked that if "a nation 
were disarmed to the point where 
no nation could get a head start 
within seventy?two hours, and where 
a time lag were.necessary to get the 
war machinery started,” then war 
could be prevented. Mr. Smith is 
strong in his conviction that action 
toward disarmament must be a mat­
ter of weeks or months; that the 
Geneva Conference has conic two 
years too latci
This Model Conference, like 
which many, have . been held through­
out the country, proved so success­
ful that the student delegates moved 
to attempt a similar conference, to 
be held in the spring, for the" forma­
tion of a young men's and womc'n’s 
political platform.
To The Fcnce
Apropos of the paragraph in last 
week's Tartan, concerning honorary 
fraternity, wc the members of Eta 
Kappa Nil • wish to take exception 
to tlie statement that this organ­
ization is one of those whose only 
activity is the pledging of new 
members on Call Day.
In general, scholastic honorary 
and professional fraternities offer 
members a greater range of activity 
after graduation by aiding them in 
making contacts, and co-operating 
with, other men in the same field. 
Wc, however, do not wish to make 
our sole claim for recognition on a 
country-widc organization, although 
Eta Kappa Nu is 4a national hon­
orary, having 23 active chapters at 
the leading technical schools of the 
country, and 11 alumni chapters in 
the leading industrial cities of the 
country. Wc do not wish to point 
to this active and rapidly growing 
organization, and rest content that 
our existence is justified, as has 
been done by other honorarics in 
the past.
At Carnegie Tech the local chap­
ter of Eta Kappa Nu has as its 
primary purpose, besides recogni­
tion of unusual ability in electrical- 
engineering work, closer co-opcra- 
tion between the students of the 
department and members of the 
faculty. There must be some body 
of men, who realize that the atti­
tude of trying to beat the profes­
sors really beats only themselves, 
and who realize that a mutual dis­
cussion of problems offers the only 
real solution.
Aside from this rather intangible 
purpose Eta Kappa Nu sponsors 
several activities' On the campus 
which seem to have gone unnoticed.
The work of decorating and paint­
ing the electrical club room on the 
second floor of Machinery Hall was 
done by Eta Kappa Nu and tlie 
responsibility for its maintenance 
rests with this organization, •
Eta Kappa Nu has charge of the 
Electrical department's contribution 
to the annual exhibition in April, 
and the members are responsible 
for the arranging of the various 
displays and the safety of the 
visitors.
The wiring and decoration of the 
gymnasium with the colored flood­
lights and revolving crystal chan- 
dclicr, as well as the electrical 
lighting for the Coronation and 
Pageant at the annual Spring Car­
nival is done each year by Eflf 
Kappa Nu.
At the present time there is un­
der discussion plans for raising the 
scholarship of the students in the 
Electrical department. The plan 
suggested for the lower two classes 
is the awarding of an electrical en­
gineering handbook to the highest 
ranking sophomore cacli year. For 
the upper classes it was proposed 
that a silver placquc be purchased 
and mounted in Machinery Hall, 
upon which the name cf the elec­
trical senior being graduated with 
the highest average each year would 
be engraved.
Simply bccause the members of 
Eta Kappa Nu do not dash about 
the campus with red skirts or green 
dinks is no indication that our 
organization is dormant, and wc as 
members of a small but vigorous 
chapter, protest our inclusion in the 
list of' “watch charm” honorarics.
