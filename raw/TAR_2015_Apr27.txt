On Thursday, the Under-
graduate Student Senate and 
the Graduate Student Assem-
bly (GSA) met for about four 
hours with intentions to ratify 
next year’s student organiza-
tion joint funding committee 
(JFC) budgets. A contentious 
issue was the over-allocation 
of the JFC budget, which 
funds student organizations, 
by nearly $100,000. While the 
GSA voted overwhelmingly to 
pass the budget, Senate did 
not approve it, meaning that 
the 2016 ?scal year budget re-
mains currently unapproved.
How does the JFC project 
the funds they will be 
able to allocate?
In February of each year, 
the student activities staff 
makes projections for antici-
pated funding for the next ?s-
cal year. 
According to Director of 
Student Activities Elizabeth 
Vaughan, this projection is 
based on three things: the 
rate of change in enrollment 
for both undergraduates and 
graduate students, the activi-
ties fee for the following year, 
and the projected number of 
dollars coming into the activi-
ties fee accounts. 
“We then use that number 
to tell the JFC how much we 
anticipate them being able to 
allocate.... Those projections 
guide the JFC in how they’re 
dividing up the money,” 
Vaughan said.
At that point, the JFC and 
the student body vice presi-
dent for ?nance (SBVPF) must 
determine whether or not 
they want the ?nal budget to 
hold to that number or if they 
are comfortable with over-
allocating funds. 
According to Vaughan, 
there is a history of student 
government approving some 
amount of over-allocation in 
anticipation of unused money 
returning to them at the end 
of the year. 
This money is returned to 
the JFC in June, after the ?nal 
?nancial reports are run for 
the ?scal year.
“We go through the roll-
over and debt forgiveness 
process to see where their 
student organization account 
has landed,” Vaughan said. 
“For the vast majority of or-
ganizations, there’s a small 
surplus in their account and, 
essentially, all of these [orga-
nizations’] accounts are put 
together and it helps us to 
get a sense of where all of the 
accounts end up.” 
There is typically a surplus, 
which goes into a holding ac-
count, and that money is allo-
cated in the next ?scal year’s 
JFC process. 
According to Divya Ko-
thandapani, the current SB-
VPF and junior electrical and 
computer engineering major, 
the amount of rollover money 
collected in ?scal year (FY) 
2014 to distribute in FY’16 is 
$73,228. 
In FY’13, $95,783 in roll-
over was collected. That 
amount, according to Kothan-
dapani, was distributed in 
FY’15.
What happened in this 
year’s budgeting process?
This year, at the joint rati-
?cation session during which 
Senate and the GSA vote on 
the budgets, Senate did not 
approve the FY’16 budgets for 
a number of reasons.
“This year, there was a 
large contingent of Senate 
that was not con?dent in the 
budget and didn’t want it to 
be approved, so they voted it 
down,” Vaughan said. “The 
senators and JFC reps that 
were there voiced a variety of

With the Secretary of 
Transportation Anthony 
Foxx coming to a school like 
Carnegie Mellon — a school 
with huge ties to robotics 
and technology — it was 
not far-fetched to think that 
he would talk about autono-
mous vehicles. He joined 
students at the university’s 
National Robotics and En-
gineering Center (NREC) in 
Lawrenceville last Thursday 
for a round table.
Self-driving vehicles could 
be a solution to many of the 
problems that plague U.S. 
streets if the dreams that en-
gineers have for the cars can 
be realized, Foxx said. “I’m 
trying to get a good read on 
whether the driverless car is 
going to bene?t us. One of 
the reasons [the Department 
of Transportation] takes a 
neutral stance on driverless 
cars is because we don’t know 
whether driverless cars or ve-
hicle-to-vehicle communica-
tions are viable in the future.”
Foxx is in a unique posi-
tion as Secretary of Trans-
portation for the coming 
years. “We look at these new 
technologies that are rising in 
recent years, and we have to 
ask certain questions: ‘Is it re-
ally saving a trip?’ ” Foxx said. 
He asked whether, with cur-
rent technology, autonomous 
vehicles could increase safe-
ty, ease congestion, decrease 
pollution, and provide other 
bene?ts.
Furthermore, he dis-
cussed how drones have been 
a case in which congestion, 
pollution, and other factors 
may not be improving from 
this technological interven-
tion. “Obviously corporations 
like Amazon are chomping at 
the bit to make commercial 
use of [drones]. The technol-
ogy is there, but the safety 
isn’t,” Foxx said. 
These products — autono-
mous aerial vehicles — aren’t 
necessarily bene?cial for the 
issues of congestion, pollu-
tion, and safety, he added. 
“The reality is we have the 
most complex airspace in the 
world.”
Foxx also addressed safety 
and the Mayor’s Challenge, a 
program that he implement-
ed during his current tenure 
as Secretary, aimed at im-
proving safety for pedestrians 
and bikers. He was inspired 
to create this program when 
he was mayor of Charlotte, 
North Carolina. The Depart-
ment of Transportation states 
about the program, “Secre-
tary Foxx is challenging may-
ors and local elected of?cials 
to take signi?cant action to 
improve safety for bicyclists 
and pedestrians of all ages 
and abilities over the next 
year.”
This hits particularly close 
to home for the Secretary, as 
a young family was hit while 
walking in the street during 
his time as mayor of Char-
lotte, an issue that could have 
been resolved with a proper 
sidewalk.
Foxx recently fought on 
Capitol Hill for an increased 
transportation budget. “What 
was really a win this year was 
the budget from the Senate,” 
Foxx said.
The Department has $70 
billion of capital to spend, ac-
cording to the Department’s 
website. Some of money 
goes to projects like Carnegie 
Mellon’s driverless Chevro-
let SUV, which Foxx gave a 
speech next to, making a quip 
that the university probably 
didn’t let him drive it because 
he would have “driven the ve-
hicle out of the robotics cen-
ter and on to the road, and 
wouldn’t have stopped.”
The majority of trans-
portation funding, though, 
goes to solving issues of road 
safety, airspace safety, and 
infrastructure management 
like roads, railroads, and 
airports. The United States 
remains the most dangerous 
nation for drivers in the G7. 
The U.S. saw 10.3 drivers 
out of 100,000 die in 2013, 
according to the Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety. 
The G7’s second most 
deadly nation in terms of traf-
?c was Italy, with a reported 
6.2 deaths per 100,000 driv-
ers, just more than half of the 
United States statistic, ac-
cording to the World Health 
Organization. Foxx ad-
dressed this issue, saying that 
the nation’s current infra-
structural system relies on a 
state-by-state transportation 
management system. He said 
that different transportation 
groups have blurred respon-
sibility. This system means 
that there is no federally 
controlled highway service, 
making mandates harder for 
the country’s transportation 
department to enact.

BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
University President Subra 
Suresh summarized the many 
initiatives born of the ?rst two 
years of his presidency during 
his ?rst annual update to the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
last Wednesday. Cohon Uni-
versity Center’s McConomy 
Auditorium was ?lled almost 
to capacity with students, fac-
ulty, and staff for the event. 
Vice Provost for Education 
and Professor of Biological 
Sciences Amy Burkert intro-
duced Suresh, and reminded 
audience members before the 
talk began that it was a closed 
event meant only for mem-
bers of the Carnegie Mellon 
community.
Suresh marks the end of 
his second year as Carnegie 
Mellon’s president with the 
update, hoping for it to be-
come a yearly event. “This is 
the beginning of an annual 
event,” Suresh said, “where 
near the end of the academic 
year I give an update about 
what happened during the 
year and what our challenges 
are, and what we as a commu-
nity have done together and 
what we still have to do in the 
following year.”
Suresh hopes to present 
to the university during the 
fall semester as well, allowing 
community members to ask 
him questions rather than pre-
senting an update, as he did 
last week.
Suresh emphasized re-
cruiting talent to Carnegie 
Mellon while keeping a strong 
focus on diversity. “For a uni-
versity like Carnegie Mellon 
to be a global leader — in 
research, in education, in ar-
tistic theater, in innovation — 
we have to be able to attract 
the best and the brightest stu-
dents from around the world 
in an increasingly competitive 
environment for resources of 
talent,” he said.
A diverse community, 
Suresh said, creates a more 
innovative university culture. 
“When we have very different 
people looking at the same 
issue from very different van-
tage points through very dif-
ferent life experiences and 
through different lenses, they 
can address the same problem 
in slightly different ways.”
Suresh also mentioned 
two university initiatives an-
nounced last week, includ-
ing further expansion along 
Forbes Avenue near Craig 
Street, and two new endowed

Claudico, a special com-

international poker stars in 
a two-week no limits Texas 
hold ’em tournament that

At Three Rivers Casino, 
the ?ve will battle it out over 
the course of 13 games to 
prove if computers can win 
over the human poker cham-
pions: Doug Polk, Dong Kim,

concerns, one being the over-
allocations of the amount of 
money that was budgeted to 
be spent. Two weeks prior to 
when the budgets were sup-
posed to be sent out, there was 
still a sizable dollar amount to 
be cut, and Senate had con-
cerns about the way that those 
cuts happened and the speed 
at which they were made. 
They also shared concerns 
about transparency and the 
way that decisions were made, 
particularly the revenue deci-
sions,” Vaughan said.
According to Kothandapa-
ni, the JFC enforced how orga-
nizations spent their revenues 
in the past. However, the JFC 
will not be enforcing revenue 
in FY’16, a change in their 
policy from previous years. In 
other words, if an organiza-
tion brings in $100 of revenue, 
they can spend it on what they 
need to spend it on. Although 
the JFC is not enforcing how 
organizations spend their rev-
enue, organizations are also 
not being forced to bring in 
revenue, Kothandapani said. 
“The JFC is a funding force 
and not an overseeing group, 
so we should be giving [or-
ganizations] money and not 
wanting to take it back at the 
end of the year. So maybe the 
JFC doesn’t bene?t as much 
from the process, but I feel like 
[organizations] would bene?t 
more,” Kothandapani said.
In the proposed budgets, 
$60,000 in revenue was 
matched up to expenses, so 
the JFC only funded the fund-
ing gap for each organization. 
Now, there is no expectation 
on revenue. At the end of the 
?scal year, if an organiza-
tion only earns some of their 
expected revenue and only 
spends some of their JFC 
subsidy, the money remain-
ing in their account will stay 
there. This gives them a better 
chance at retaining their mon-
ey if the revenue is not met, 
unlike in previous years.
The JFC initially allocated 
approximately $2 million 
to organizations in a non-
released draft of the budget. 
Since then, they have cut 
about $500,000 from the ini-
tial draft, said junior math 
and economics double major 
and SBVPF-elect Benjamin 
Zhang. Those cuts, made in 
two weeks, were the ones that 
raised concerns for many sen-
ators, according to Vaughan. 
Though the GSA voted to ap-
prove the proposed budgets, 
Senate did not and now mem-
bers of student activities, stu-
dent government, and the JFC 
are working to prepare a new 
slate of budgets for approval 
before the end of the ?scal 
year, June 30.
“Student Government is 
currently in the process of ?g-
uring out what the next steps 
are to create a new budget 
slate and we will be in touch 
with you shortly for further 
details,” Kothandapani said 
in an email sent out to stu-
dent organization leaders last 
Friday.
What steps were taken 
at Thursday’s meeting to 
pass the budget?
When the budget was 
presented to the joint ses-
sion body, there was nearly 
$100,000 in over-allocated 
funds that needed to be cut. 
During second round appeals, 
any senator or GSA represen-
tative can appeal line items 
from the proposed budget. 
This year, there were three 
line items of the overall bud-
get that senators appealed in 
the discussion: funds for the 
Carnival committee, the SB-
VPF, and Scotch ’n’ Soda. The 
Carnival committee’s budget 
for Carnival’s relocation to 
the College of Fine Arts park-
ing lot was cut by $50,500, 
the SBVPF’s budget for event 
subsidies when AB Tech is not 
available to cover events was 
cut from $10,000 to $3,000, 
and the Scotch’n’Soda budget 
was cut by $900 to account for 
a budgeting error.
Even with these cuts, the 
budget was still over-allocated 
by over $41,000, according to 
Vaughan. “There has, histori-
cally, been several times in the 
last six years where there have 
been over allocations between 
$41,000 and $50,000, how-
ever those were in the years 
before the activities fee was 
raised to accommodate the 
needs,” Vaughan said. 
This year, the over-alloca-
tion prompted some senators 
to question the integrity of the 
budget and to vote against its 
approval. Senate voted 3–16–
2 to strike it down, and GSA 
voted 45–0–2 in overwhelm-
ing support of the budget.
The GSA reps that were 
on the JFC didn’t have any 
issues with the JFC process, 
according to Kothandapani. 
“The GSA looked to the people 
that were on the JFC for their 
opinion, and I felt like the GSA 
trusted the JFC reps and they 
were okay with it,” she said.
What happens if the 
budgets aren’t approved 
by May 1?
Members of student gov-
ernment, student activities, 
and the JFC worked over the 
weekend to formulate a plan 
for another slate of budgets. 
“We had conversations all 
day on Friday to determine a 
course of action for the bud-
gets,” Vaughan said. “But 
those conversations led to 
a lot of questions and a lot 
of consulting the governing 
documents.”
The constitution of student 
government speci?es that if 
the budgets are not approved 
by May 1, GSA and Senate can-
not spend any money from op-
erating accounts until the bud-
get is approved. Essentially, 
bodies wouldn’t be able to 
function after that date.
“We want to move as ex-
pediently as possible, par-
ticularly knowing the time 
of the year, and the speci?c 
constraints that the governing 
documents laid out,” Vaughan 
said. “We’re trying to move ef-
?ciently as possible, but while 
being as prudent as possible. 
We made a well-informed de-
cision on Friday, but we want 
to make sure it makes sense. 
As the advisor, I have to help 
them make the right set of de-
cisions for the budget.”
Members of Senate and 
GSA met at the end of last 
week and over the weekend to 
further discuss the budget and 
why it didn’t pass. The Senate 
executive committee is meet-
ing on Tuesday to discuss a 
consolidated rationale for the 
budget votes, according to Ko-
thandapani and Zhang. 
“There are competing de-
mands: student organizations, 
student government, etc. It’s a 
challenging time of year, be-
tween the academics and the 
looming deadlines,” Vaughan 
said. “There are next steps to 
be made and there will be a 
series to bring closure to the 
budgets and it’s important that 
[Kothandapani] and [Zhang] 
communicate it to orgs.”
According to Kothandapa-
ni’s email, “In the event that a 
JFC budget slate is not passed 
by the end of the current ?s-
cal year (June 30th, 2015), 
organizations will receive 25 
percent of the JFC subsidy 
received in the current ?scal 
year.”
She promised that student 
government was working over 
the weekend to solve the prob-
lem and prevent it from going 
that far, additionally promis-
ing that updates will be an-
nounced in a timely manner.

sity owns on the south side 
of Forbes Avenue, near Craig 
Street,” said Farnam Jaha-
nian, who will soon become 
Carnegie Mellon’s provost af-
ter a year serving as vice pres-
ident of research, in a univer-
sity-wide email sent the day 
before the address about the 
Forbes Avenue development. 
“This development could 
include research space for 
faculty and students, space 
for external partners, labs 
and studios for collaborative 
industry-academia use, of?ce 
space, a quality hotel, park-
ing, and some retail space.”
Among the other initia-
tives that Suresh mentioned 
were the Simon Initiative, 
the upcoming Tepper Quad-
rangle, and the university’s 
fundraising efforts. 
The university, Suresh 
said, has raised an unprec-
edented amount of money 
in the last two years for the 
endowment, which has long 
been much smaller than those 
of older peer institutions.
“What we are looking at 
in just the next three years 
is a half-billion dollars in 
new construction, more than 
750,000 new square feet of 
space,” Suresh said about the 
university’s various planned 
expansions along what he 
calls the “Forbes Avenue in-
novation corridor.” According 
to Suresh, this expansion is 
the largest since the univer-
sity’s founding and original 
gift from founder Andrew 
Carnegie.
Student Body President-
Elect and junior policy and 
management and Chinese 
studies double major JR 
Marshall was galvanized by 
Suresh’s speech.
“I think we have plans to 
become more than some-
thing that we are right now, 
which is a world leader in in-
novation and research, a kind 
of forefront university — a 
pioneer university,” Marshall 
said. “It’s nothing new; I don’t 
think this university’s been 
anything but, but I think it’s 
time for the university to take 
on a leadership, a pioneer 
attitude.”
Jibby Ayo-Ani, junior in-
formation systems major and 
student body vice president-
elect, agreed with Marshall, 
emphasizing that the univer-
sity’s progress relies on effort 
from every member of the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
“It’s everyone’s respon-
sibility. You know it doesn’t 
always come from the leader-
ship — it comes from every 
person. So we are taking on 
that responsibility, as stu-
dents, as faculty members, as 
administration, in relation to 
things that we as a university 
are focusing on,” she said.
Suresh’s overarching mes-
sage was one of hope for 
Carnegie Mellon’s future. 
“I knew a lot about CMU 
[before I became president]. I 
was very proud of being given 
the opportunity to come here, 
to lead this wonderful institu-
tion. And what I’ve learned in 
the past two years is that I’m 
even prouder now; I’m even 
more optimistic.”
Suresh gives campus update
there was a lot of preparing to 
do, but there wasn’t much. 
They basically were set with 
the Obama cleansing ?re,” 
Montgomery said. 
He described the “cleans-
ing ?re” as a government 
sweep of the building prior 
to President Barack Obama’s 
visit to the facility in 2011. 
Walking into the building, 
visitors must present a valid 
identi?cation of United States 
citizenship. The building feels 
like an airplane hangar. The 
table discussion included 
some of Carnegie Mellon’s 
most decorated graduate 
and undergraduate students. 
Heinz College informa-
tion systems management 
graduate student Zoe Leven-
son led most of the discussion.
The open discussion be-
gan with Foxx asking students 
about autonomous vehicles. 
The discussion then moved to 
students’ questions. The room 
was full of public policy, en-
gineering, and computer sci-
ence graduate students.
Immediately following this 
discussion was a presentation 
of many technologies at the 
NREC. Particularly notewor-
thy was Robotics Institute 
project scientist Robert Tam-
buro’s “Smart Headlight.” 
The headlights are pro-
grammed to not ?ash bright 
lights in deer’s faces so as not 
to blind them. Additionally, 
the headlight is slanted to 
avoid illuminating snow?akes 
or raindrops, increasing vis-
ibility for drivers.
Safety and overall public 
transport were among the 
several things Secretary Foxx 
brought up when speaking on 
the ?oor of the NREC ware-
house, with people seated 
in front of him, and workers 
watching on the catwalks 
above. 
At the end, Foxx noted 
how technology has improved 
so much since the dawn of 
the car, and that it was only 
natural for autonomous cars 
to be the next step in the new 
millennium. “I think the us-
ers — you — in the future 
are going to be seeing a lot 
more seamlessness in the way 
transportation moves,” Foxx 
concluded.

Gold nanoparticles have unique form

Town in Indiana experiences growth in HIV outbreak
According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC), there has been 
a severe increase in the rate of 
outbreak of HIV (human im-
munode?ciency virus) infec-
tions within a rural county in 
Indiana. 
The increased rates have 
been occuring since mid-
December. In March, the out-
break was declared a public 
emergency within that county. 
As of Friday, 142 people were 
shown to test positive for HIV, 
a signi?cant amount for an 
area with a population of a 
few thousand people. 
The CDC and state health 
of?cials believe that IV drug 
use, which is common in the 
rural area, is the culprit be-
hind the outbreak. Drug us-
ers often share needles, which 
increases the risk of spreading 
new HIV infections. 
In order to combat the 
problem, the Indiana gover-
nor has signed a mandate to 
make sterile needle syringes 
more available to the public. 
In addition, health volunteers 
from Indiana University are 
being deployed to test and 
treat HIV cases, as well as to 
educate the public about the 
danger of sharing needles.

Whether you’re a baby, an 
actress, an onion-dicer, or just 
a normal, emotional human 
being, you’ve probably cried 
more often than you care to 
recall.
There’s a certain stigma 
that surrounds crying, that it 
makes one seem weak or that 
it’s only acceptable following 
devastating tragedies. But be-
yond the fact that nearly each 
and every one of us is “crying” 
at all times, crying is an amaz-
ing and relieving bodily pro-
cess that should be anything 
but shameful.
There are three types of 
tears: basal, re?ex, and psy-
chic/emotional, each with a 
distinct chemical make-up. 
Basal tears act as lubricant for 
the eye, keeping the cornea 
— the outermost part of the 
eye — moist and friction free. 
Basal tears are composed of 
water, oil, and mucus, allow-
ing them to create a protec-
tive ?lm across the eye.
Re?ex tears are secreted 
in order to rid the eye of con-
taminants, and are about 98 
percent water. An example 
of a re?ex tear reaction is 
the standard onion-chopping 
scenario, in which case the 
fumes from the onion are 
toxic to the eye, and the re?ex 
tears ?ush the toxins out.
Psychic tears exhibit a 
completely different compo-
sition from the other types. 
Psychic tears contain leucine 
enkephalin, a painkiller and 
mood-enhancer; prolactin, a 
hormone which affects breast 
milk production; and various 
stress hormones. 
Psychic tears also appear 
to have different structures 
from each other, depending 
on the emotion that brought 
them on. In her series The 
Topography of Tears, photog-
rapher Rose-Lynn Fisher took 
pictures of samples of dried 
tears under a microscope, us-
ing re?ex tears from an on-
ion-cutting session, and psy-
chic tears brought on by grief, 
joy, and loss, among others. 
The microscope images re-
vealed different structures for 
all three.
The actual mechanism 
behind crying is rather sim-
ple. For basal and re?ex tears, 
the process of their release 
into the eye is called lacri-
mation. The lacrimal glands 
— located just above the eye 
opposite the nose — are re-
sponsible for tear production 
and secretion. Once secreted, 
the tears can either be spread 
across the eye by blinking, 
thereby moisturizing the eye, 
or run through the lacrimal 
sac, located between the eye 
and nose, and drain into the 
nose. This draining is the 
reason that one can expect a 
runny nose when crying.
For psychic tears, the pro-
cess of their release is what 
is most commonly known as 
crying. Psychic tear produc-
tion is mediated by the lim-
bic system, the neural basis 
for emotion. In response to 
intense emotion, the hypo-
thalamus — a brain region 
responsible for many autono-
mous processes — releases a 
neurotransmitter called ace-
tylcholine, which signals the 
lacrimal glands to open the 
proverbial ?ood gates.
When we are born, our 
?rst cry follows our ?rst 
breath. Crying stays with us 
all throughout our lives, and 
develops a level of sophistica-
tion as time goes on. In the 
early stages of infancy, crying 
is the method by which babies 
meet their most basic needs. 
As they develop, so do their 
cries. 
Babies aged about 10 
months have been known to 
display three distinct cries, 
which differ from each other 
in pitch, frequency, and du-
ration. They cry if they’re in 
pain, if they’re angry, or if a 
need is unmet. It is commonly 
believed that with this practi-
cal sophistication, babies also 
develop manipulative crying 
at this stage.
When individuals hit pu-
berty, males and females tend 
to develop different crying 
habits. Females, due to in-
creased estrogen, which in 
turn causes increased endo-
crine activity, are estimated 
to cry about ?ve times as 
often as men, and there are 
a number of reasons why. 
Women are more likely to cry 
when frustrated, while men 
are most likely to cry when 
exposed to intense emotion, 
and respond to frustration 
with anger more often than 
sadness. 
As they get older, men and 
women tend to trade places, 
with men crying more often 
than they get angry, and 
women experiencing the op-
posite, due to decreasing 
amounts of testosterone and 
estrogen, respectively.
Crying, along with other 
positive emotional expres-
sions, has been correlated 
with decreased risk of hy-
pertension, heart disease, 
and perhaps even colitis and 
ulcers. Crying cleanses the 
body of toxins such as stress 
hormones, allowing the body 
to feel more relaxed. So next 
time you’re caught in a deluge 
of sadness with no umbrella, 
cuddle up in your Snuggie 
with a nice pint of Chubby 
Hubby and take pride in 
knowing that you are not only 
exhibiting a fantastic chemi-
cal process, but you are also 
doing your body a favor.

Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University and Dis-
ney Research have developed 
physical additions to smart 
phones, such as knobs, but-
tons, sliders, wheels and 
switches, that can control 
the touch screens using the 
phone’s own ultrasound.
Dubbed “acoustruments,” 
these add-ons were inspired 
by the different ways that 
wind instruments, such as 
whistles and ?utes, utilize 
different sized holes to pro-
duce different sounds. With 
acoustruments, plastic tubes 
and other structures connect 
the phone’s speaker, which 
emits a continuous stream 
of ultrasound frequencies, to 
its microphone. The physical 
shape of the acoustrument 
provides different ways to 
stop or alter the frequency, 
for example by blocking and 
opening holes or chang-
ing the length of the tubing. 
These interactions effectively 
transform the sound before 
it reaches the phone’s micro-
phone. No electrical circuitry 
is involved, so acoustruments 
are inexpensive to make and 
can be produced with 3-D 
printers, injection molds, or 
even by hand.
Gierad Laput, a Ph.D stu-
dent in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Human-Computer Interac-
tion Institute (HCII), is the 
lead author of the study, 
which was presented last 
Wednesday at the 2015 Con-
ference on Human Factors 
in Computing Systems, in 
Seoul, South Korea. The pa-
per has been named a Best 
Paper by the conference or-
ganizers.
“We’re providing people 
with tangible interactivity at 
basically no cost,” said Laput 
in a Carnegie Mellon press re-
lease. “Using smartphones as 
computers to control toys, ap-
pliances, and robots already 
is a growing trend, particu-
larly in the maker communi-
ty. Acoustruments can make 
the interactivity of these new 
‘pluggable’ applications even 
richer.”
As an example of the 
wide range of possibilities of 
acoustruments, the research-
ers created an add-on that 
acts as a physical alarm clock 
with an on/off button and a 
snooze button. The add-on 
utilizes a pressure sensor to 
disrupt sound and tell the 
phone what to do. Research-
ers have also developed an 
acoustrument that is a part 
of the phone case and acts 
as a camera shutter, one that 
turns the phone into a toy 
car, and one that transforms 
the phone into an interactive 
doll.
Carnegie Mellon and Dis-
ney researchers have deter-
mined in their experiments 
that acoustruments can 
control a smart phone with 
99 percent accuracy. In ad-
dition to Laput, the research 
team included two HCII fac-
ulty members, Scott Hudson 
and Chris Harrison, and Eric 
Brockmeyer of Disney Re-
search Pittsburgh.
Researchers develop heart simulation
Multiple forms of crying provide emotional, health bene?ts
HOW THINGS WORK
Abhinav Gautam/Photo Editor
Lewis Waldman, CEO of Insilicomed Inc., spoke last week at Carnegie Mellon about his work involving the development of a 3-D simulation of the heart. 
Eunice Oh/Art Editor
CMU and Disney researchers create acoustruments
at Insilicomed, Inc., began 
their own study, attempting 
to see if they could get away 
without making extra mea-
surements, but simply using 
the standard collection of 
clinical data to make accurate 
models. In the past few years 
a convergence of both meth-
ods has allowed the scientists 
to ?nd that all the extra mea-
surements are not needed 
to build the most accurate 
models. It allowed them to 
pinpoint exactly which data 
points would need to be col-
lected. These computational 
simulations not only allow a 
model of the heart problem 
but also enable the testing of 
CPT treatments. According to 
Waldman, currently 30 to 40 
percent of CPT treatments do 
not work because there is a 
lack of understanding of the 
underlying problem in a spe-
ci?c patient. By collecting the 
necessary data from a patient, 
the simulation then allows a 
doctor to create a personal-
ized model of the heart and 
thus implement a personal-
ized treatment. Their studies 
have examined the impact of 
this approach and found that 
their simulations have a very 
strong clinical response.
Waldman explained in 
his seminar in dense techni-
cal detail that their simula-
tions reach a high level of 
accuracy because each node 
that models the heart carries 
an immense amount of infor-
mation. To generate a 3-D an-
imation, each node contains 
seven derivates in each direc-
tion, leading to thousands 
of elements that achieve a 
highly precise biomechanics 
modeling.
In addition to a direct 
clinical applications, the 
modeling of the heart enables 
other researchers to visual-
ize the heart and the impact 
of the devices they create. 
Dennis Trumble, a profes-
sor of biomedical engineer-
ing at Carnegie Mellon and 
the individual who invited 
Waldman to give the lecture, 
works on developing implant-
able medical devices meant 
to prevent cardiac arrest. He 
mentioned that using the 
simulation allows his team 
to directly test their devices 
structurally in the models, 
saving them the time and 
money of conducting experi-
ments directly in animals and 
drastically speeding up the 
research and development 
process.
Enabling this level of pre-
cision in cardiovascular medi-
cine will enable a new age of 
personalized medicine. With 
advances in computing power 
and the emergence of ma-
chine learning, these models 
will only become more ac-
curate and may become a 
commonplace in the clinical 
realm.

one and 100 nanometers in 
size and consist of a core of 
atoms surrounded by surface-
protecting molecules. In the 
case of Au133, the core is made 
up of 133 gold atoms and the 
surface molecules are known 
as thiolate ligands. These thio-
late ligands are extremely im-
portant for the nanoparticle 
because they consist of sulfur 
atoms that bond tightly with 
the gold core, holding each 
nanoparticle together and pre-
venting them from aggregat-
ing with one another.
“The most important part 
is the surface, because it sta-
bilizes the nanoparticle,” Zeng 
said. “But we know the least 
about it.” Although nanopar-
ticles can be imaged through 
electron microscopy, these 
images only show the cores 
of nanoparticles. This occurs 
because heavy atoms like gold 
can scatter electrons very well, 
while the thiolate ligands on 
the surface cannot. Because of 
this, the researchers must turn 
to a technique known as X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), a method 
in which the way a crystal dif-
fracts X-rays reveals the crys-
tal’s structure.
This is where the team 
faced its greatest obstacle, be-
cause to do XRD, a single crys-
tal of nanoparticles is needed. 
Jin explained this idea us-
ing the analogy of ice cubes, 
which are single crystals of 
water. “So that’s easy, you put 
your solution in the freezer 
and the next morning you will 
have single crystals and if you 
take a small piece and take it 
to the XRD, you will be able to 
see the oxygen and the hydro-
gen,” Jin said. “So we are do-
ing the same thing, but instead 
of water molecules, we are try-
ing to crystallize nanoparticles 
— and obviously it is much 
more dif?cult.”
Although the chemists 
crystallized smaller nanoclu-
sters in the past, crystallizing 
larger nanoparticles such as 
Au133 was much more daunt-
ing. After tackling the prob-
lem for two years, the recipe 
they perfected had two main 
factors. The ?rst is that a very 
high-purity batch of Au133 nanoparticles is needed. In 
other words, a solution con-
taining only Au133 nanopar-
ticles is more likely to be 
crystallized successfully than 
a solution contaminated with 
nanoclusters of other sizes.
The second key fac-
tor is the choice of surface 
protecting molecules. The 
group used a molecule called 
4-tert-butylbenzenethiol, bet-
ter known as TBBT, which con-
sists of a rigid benzene ring — 
a ring of six carbon atoms with 
a hydrogen atom attached to 
each carbon. The rigidness of 
these surface molecules al-
lows the Au133 nanoparticles 
to pack together very snugly, 
with each nanoparticle in the 
same orientation. It is this con-
sistent orientation that allows 
the nanoparticles to be crystal-
lized. “We can only crystallize 
the particles if they are packed 
in a periodical way,” Zeng said.
Having success-
fully crystallized Au133 
nanoparticles, the research-
ers were able to analyze its 
structure. They found that 
several of the gold shells were 
constructed in an octahedron 
structure. The most beautiful 
part, though, was the surface 
of the nanoparticle: the sur-
face molecules attached to 
the core atoms in sulfur-gold-
sulfur links that resembled 
little staples on the outside of 
the nanoparticle. “We think 
the most amazing thing is how 
these staples protect the gold 
core,” Zeng said. “We found 
that the staples aren’t random. 
They actually form these very 
beautiful helical-like patterns 
that we call stripes.”
Besides these stripes, the 
chemists found that there was 
yet another pattern. The car-
bon tails of the surface mol-
ecules formed elegant swirls 
around the nanoparticle. “You 
can see a lot of these same 
patterns in nature,” Jin em-
phasized. “For example, the 
octahedron structure is the 
same shape as a mosaic virus, 
the helical structures look 
just like DNA, and the swirls 
are just like our galaxy. We 
see all the same patterns in 
the tiny world of a nanopar-
ticle.” Despite how vast our 
galaxy is and how minuscule a 
nanoparticle is, both share the 
same patterns.
Besides being a beautiful at-
testation of nature’s universal-
ity, these Au133 nanoparticles 
have applications in catalysis, 
electronics, and healthcare. 
For example, Jin’s group has 
been using them to catalyze — 
speed up — the reaction that 
converts carbon monoxide, a 
toxic gas, to carbon dioxide.
Zeng explained that the 
Au133 nanoparticles are ex-
tremely stable, as they can ex-
ist in air at room temperature. 
“We think that their stabil-
ity is related to the very sym-
metric surface patterns,” she 
said. “We think it’s nature’s 
strategy for fabricating robust 
nanoparticles.”

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
The transition from Spring Car-
nival to ?nals is stressful. Carnegie 
Mellon students are ?nally able to 
look forward to summer, but often 
take that deadline as license to push 
themselves to their limits. They ra-
tionalize a sleepless week with the 
impending summer reprieve, and 
fail to take care of themselves in the 
process.
Stress culture is real on the Carn-
egie Mellon campus. It has become 
a feature of campus dialogue, but it 
persists. People are proud of sleep-
less nights and try to top each other 
in the “my workload is larger than 
your workload” game. Neither physi-
cal nor mental personal health holds 
top priority. The “work hard, play 
hard” philosophy encourages stu-
dents to relax sporadically or to over-
indulge, instead of keeping up with 
frequent maintainable behaviors. 
In some ways, Carnival exacerbates 
the problem when people “save up” 
to party harder-than-typical during 
one crazy weekend. While this is not 
everyone’s Carnival experience, it is 
the popular representation of Carni-
val among students and alumni.
Given the academic calendar, 
professors tend to load the two 
weeks between Carnival and ?nals 
with midterms, essays, and project 
due dates. With only two weeks of 
class until ?nals to bridge the gap, 
people seem to carry the Carnival 
mentality into their work. They push 
themselves to dangerous levels for 
two weeks, knowing that they are 
close to the ?nish line of summer. 
Summer is hardly a break in itself: 
students work, have internships, 
take classes, or do research, and yet 
there is a real danger of burning out 
before summer even arrives.
The Tartan recognizes the prob-
lem, but also sees that students are 
working as they feel they must in 
order to accomplish their work in 
time. Very few universities require 
?ve classes per semester in order to 
graduate on time, so Carnegie Mel-
lon students balance more work than 
average at ?nals time. 
The Tartan encourages students 
to pace themselves in these last 
weeks of the semester. Workload 
and deadlines have to be part of a 
dynamic conversation between pro-
fessors and students in order to keep 
these last weeks challenging but not 
overwhelming.

Teachers, students must collaborate for healthier ?nals
Robertson’s gender equality victory cannot forget Pao
Three weeks ago, the Tartan gave 
its thoughts on the gender discrimi-
nation case that Ellen Pao ?led and 
lost. What makes cases like these so 
dif?cult to win is that many cases of 
workplace discrimination against 
women are too subtle to effectively 
document and “prove.”
Therefore, it is heartening to hear 
the recent case of Fayette County cit-
izen Sandra Robertson. After hear-
ing her testimony about the discrim-
ination she faced in her workplace, 
a jury awarded her an unheard of 
$12.5 million in damages.
A 20-year veteran of the Air Force, 
Robertson was hired at Hunter Pan-
els in 2006 and became shipping 
manager. As an ex-military woman, 
she was used to working in a male-
dominated industry, but while Rob-
ertson says she “can take a joke,” 
her experiences at Hunter Panels 
exceeded what any woman should 
have to tolerate.
Co-workers called her “big girl,” 
made obscene gestures when her 
voice came over the radio, and 
claimed she was “losing her mind” or 
“throwing ?ts” when she complained 
about the treatment. 
Evidence also showed that Rob-
ertson received less money than her 
male predecessor, despite her expe-
rience in the ?eld.
She was even referred to a coun-
selor for anger management, only 
for the counselor to deem that she 
did not require any treatment. Not 
only were Robertson’s complaints 
ignored several times, but she was 
?red in retaliation. The company cit-
ed her alleged poor job performance 
and management style.
The jury made this decision in-
tending to make a point that corpo-
rations cannot continue to discrimi-
nate against women. 
The forewoman said “This is an 
opportunity to set the tone.” This 
is tremendously encouraging. The 
Tartan hopes that this will set a prec-
edent for women ?ling and winning 
cases against corporate giants. How-
ever, we have to realize that this is a 
limited victory.
There are some really funda-
mental differences between Sandra 
Robertson’s and Ellen Pao’s cases. 
Robertson and Pao were very dif-
ferent plaintiffs, venture capitalism 
and construction have very different 
work environments, and gender dis-
crimination comes in many shapes 
and sizes.
We still have to be conscious that 
every case is unique and often evi-
dence will not be so cut and dry. Rob-
ertson deserves praise for her cour-
age and celebration for her victory, 
but those who ?ght for workplace 
equality cannot forget about Pao.
Journalism is indispensable for progressive society

Last Monday, David Koch of the 
infamous Koch Brothers suggested 
at a fundraiser that he believes that 
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker 
should be the Republican nominee 
for President.
Some in the media took this to be 
a tacit endorsement of Walker, while 
others have said that the Kochs will 
wait to endorse. The skeptics point 
to Walker’s recent gaffes, such as 
“punting” on a question so simple as 
evolution or making several clearly 
uninformed comments on foreign 
policy, as well as his shift to the far-
Right on some moderate sticking 
points such as immigration, surely 
disagreeable to the Libertarian-
leaning Kochs.
Whether the Koch brothers ulti-
mately support Walker or not, the 
buzz around David Koch’s comment 
means that the real 2016 primary 
election has of?cially begun: the 
scramble for the money of the me-
ga-donors. While candidates in both 
parties have to go state-by-state in 
primary elections to win their par-
ty’s nomination, their success hinges 
largely on their ability to win over 
the super rich.
In many cases, presidential pri-
mary campaigns are ?nanced almost 
entirely by a handful of huge dona-
tions from the obscenely wealthy. 
Before candidates can depend on 
the weight of their party’s support 
and donor-base in the general elec-
tion, they need to ?nd a sugar daddy 
or sugar momma to get their cam-
paign off the ground and into the 
primaries.
Think about it: The very ?rst 
primary elections for 2016 are still 
about eight months away. The pri-
mary elections run much longer 
than the general election, and can-
didates in the primary have to fo-
cus on campaigning in every single 
state in a way that they don’t for the 
general. Candidates in primary elec-
tions have less name recognition 
and receive less “free advertising” 
through media coverage, so they 
have to spend more money getting 
their name out there than in the 
general.
All these extra demands come on 
top of the public’s general indiffer-
ence to the primary elections. Most 
people don’t really pay attention to 
politics before the general election, 
let alone give money to candidates. 
Additionally, many small dollar do-
nors and organizations wait to give 
money until their preferred party 
has nominated a candidate, and 
the largest source of money in cam-
paigns — the political parties — ob-
viously don’t provide funding to can-
didates until the party has selected a 
nominee.
Candidates in primary elections 
have to overcome immense expenses 
without the reliable funding stream 
of an of?cial presidential nominee. 
The result is that candidates have no 
other choice but to campaign to the 
super wealthy. 
Hence, the existence of “hidden 
primary:” the real election to deter-
mine which candidates can run for 
President. The electorate is the elite, 
the top 1 percent of the top 1 per-
cent, who vote with dollars instead 
of ballots.
Why does this matter? Well, just 
like any other election, the voters in 
the hidden primary expect the can-
didate they elect to represent them. 
It’s important to remember that the 
super wealthy who get to vote in the 
hidden primary tend to be success-
ful investors and shrewd business 
people. 
They view the money that they 
spend in elections like any other 
investment or business transaction. 
They expect a return on their in-
vestment, and services provided for 
their business transaction.
The Koch brothers, who by their 
own estimates expect to spend just 
under $1 billion in the 2016 elec-
tions at the local, state, and federal 
level, can easily expect to earn back 
several billion dollars in the form 
of deregulation, subsidies, and tax 
cuts. In a slightly different context, 
exchanging money for political fa-
vors is called bribery. But in the 
United States, it’s called “Campaign 
Contributions.”
Unlike a lot of progressives, I 
don’t believe that the Koch Broth-
ers are any more nefarious than any 
other mega-donors. Okay, that’s not 
true — the Koch Brothers are pretty 
nefarious. But, on the whole, this 
isn’t just a problem with Republi-
can donors and Republican candi-
dates. Money in politics is the big-
gest threat to our democracy, and 
it has infected the operations and 
priorities of both political parties. 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign, for in-
stance, expects to spend about $2.5 
billion dollars in the 2016 election, 
far more than any other campaign in 
history.
We have to ask ourselves, with 
so much money in the system and 
so much in?uence from the super-
wealthy, are regular people really 
being represented anymore? The 
ideal of a representative democracy 
like ours should be one person, one 
vote. 
We have lost sight of that ideal. 
There can’t be complete equality in 
every facet of our society, and there 
shouldn’t be. But when it comes to 
selecting our leaders, a poor single 
mother should have just as much in-
?uence as David Koch.
Emmett Eldred (eeldred@) is a 
staffwriter for The Tartan.
Democracy is worthless when based on wealth
“The Koch brothers, who by their own 
estimates expect to spend just under $1 
billion in the 2016 elections at the local, 
state, and federal level, can easily expect 
to earn back several billion dollars in 
the form of regulations, subsidies, and 
tax cuts. In a slightly different context, 
exchanging money for political favors is 
called bribery. But in the United States, 
it’s called ‘Campaign Contributions’. ”
This year’s recipients of the illus-
trious Pulitzer Prize for journalism 
were announced last week. It came 
to light that one of the winners — 
Rob Kuznia, from the small Los An-
geles County paper The Daily Breeze 
— had ceased his work as a journal-
ist shortly after publishing his win-
ning story. The newspaper business 
wasn’t adequately paying Kuznia’s 
bills, and he now works in public re-
lations for the University of Southern 
California.
The case of Kuznia illustrates sev-
eral things about the current state of 
American journalism. On the pessi-
mistic side of the spectrum, Kuznia 
is among the many casualties of the 
declining position of journalism. Lo-
cal print newspapers like The Daily 
Breeze exemplify the problem.
In an interview with NPR, Kun-
zia said that the number of journal-
ists employed at his former paper 
dropped from 25 to a meager seven 
in the last ?ve years alone. He said 
that he and his girlfriend were “liv-
ing paycheck to paycheck... not des-
titute, but saving nothing.” Unfor-
tunately, Kuznia’s story is far from 
unique.
Kuznia is a perfect reminder of 
the great value that quality jour-
nalism continues to have in society. 
Written along with two other Daily 
Breeze journalists, his Pulitzer-win-
ning series of stories investigated 
corruption in a local school district 
and ultimately led to changes in Cali-
fornia state law, according to Slate 
Magazine.
Even while the national news 
scene is often characterized as a con-
stant barrage of content that falls on 
deaf ears and cannot be trusted, lo-
cal newspapers still have the power 
to raise awareness and catalyze con-
crete change in their communities. 
Kuznia reminds us that good jour-
nalism is still relevant.
Kuznia’s story highlights the need 
for continued support and patronage 
of local and national journalism. If 
we don’t pay for journalists who root 
out and reveal corruption, we will 
?nd ourselves with a fundamentally 
weaker society.

A PERSON’S OPINION
The Tartan is gearing up for the last week of classes, ?nals, and the future this week. So we asked graduating seniors,
What are you doing after graduation?

The search engine industry  — it’s 
a winner-takes-all business. It ap-
pears that way in the United States at 
least, but things aren’t always what 
they seem.
About 70 percent of American 
web searches are made through 
Google, according to The New York 
Post. In Europe, Google’s market 
share is signi?cantly higher at over 90 
percent. Many in the European Union 
(EU) believe this to be unprecedent-
ed, particularly the EU’s Competition 
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. 
Vestager called for the ?ling of anti-
trust charges against Google, effec-
tive April 15.
Google denies claims that its 
search engine caters results to maxi-
mize its own visibility and pro?ts, 
which the EU cites as its major rea-
soning for the charges. 
For example, a user will search 
“?ights to London,” and the page will 
show google.com/?ights dominat-
ing half of the viewable results in the 
window. However, Google only has 5 
percent of the online traveling mar-
ket share.
Google argues that this is evidence 
against the claims in the lawsuit, 
as according to NPR correspondent 
Laura Sydell, “U.S. antitrust regula-
tors have looked into these same is-
sues and determined that there is no 
harm being done to consumers.” This 
is ludicrous.
Imagine walking into a Walmart, 
and seeing all of Walmart’s brand 
items stacked on shelves in front of 
market-dominating brands like Ad-
vil or Tide, instead of being placed 
beside them. It may not seem the 
case, but it is. According to Marketing 
Land, “on the ?rst page [of Google 
results] alone, the ?rst 5 results ac-
count for 67.60 percent of all the 
clicks,” with the next 5 only having 
3.73 percent.
It pays to be a winner, and if a 
company is ?rst on Google Search’s 
results, it most certainly is a winner. 
Thus, with examples like the afore-
mentioned ?ights search, Google is 
marketing its products for free. This 
additionally boosts user visits to its 
own sites, regardless of whether us-
ers prefer its products to competitors 
such as Amazon.
When a company gets too large, 
market imperfections are bound to 
occur. This is a simple law of econom-
ics. Google, the company that’s motto 
is “do no evil,” has sadly created ex-
ternalities in its market. 
Even if Google wins the suit, it is 
a risky deal. The antitrust case could 
cost the company over $6 billion in 
legal fees and other expenses.
If the EU builds up a strong 
enough case, it may be in Google’s 
best interest to settle. If the charges 
prove valid, and the EU wins, Google 
may see action taken against it in the 
United States. 
New York University economics 
professor Nicholas Economides com-
mented on potential U.S. involve-
ment in an interview on NPR: “When 
there is a suit, even if it happens in 
Europe, because of the cooperation 
between the U.S. government and 
the EU, there is information that 
comes up and is going to be shared 
with the United States.”
It is hard to tell whether this will 
happen, as Microsoft faced similar 
charges in the past and lost. Many 
say that Microsoft may be lobbying 
for the law suit against Google. That 
could be true, though this week Ve-
steger has gone beyond Google, and 
has ?led antitrust charges against an-
other behemoth in its own respects: 
Russian oil giant Gazprom.
Gazprom is state run, and current-
ly provides the majority of gasoline 
sales in Eastern Europe. The Russian 
government also invaded Sevastopol, 
Ukraine in March of last year, elimi-
nating market competitor Naftohaz 
Ukrayiny’s control of an oil pipeline 
that provided 80 percent of Eastern 
Europe’s oil exports to the EU.
While all these charges may seem 
over-zealous, it is plain to see the 
logical arguments behind the claims. 
Occasionally companies become too 
powerful, and it is the job of govern-
ing bodies to regulate imperfections 
to markets as such. 
However, these current antitrust 
allegations are not all black and 
white. One includes a potential de-
sign ?aw and the semantics of law 
on the Internet, while the other con-
cerns a complex civil war in the fore-
ground. 
It is up to the judiciary body of 
the European Union to deal the ?nal 
judgment on the matter.
EU may have solid case against Google in antitrust suit

GORDON ESTES
Junior Staffwriter
The last few years have brought 
a surge of good cartoons to our tele-
vision screens — a “Golden Age,” as 
some people are calling it. This recent 
trend of shows, including Adventure 
Time, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, 
and even My Little Pony, have pro-
vided more than just high quality and 
equally high ratings. They’ve brought 
representation back into children’s 
television, and in a way that’s much 
more genuine than  ’90s tokenism.
Ethnic minorities haven’t been 
made the only new focus of cartoons. 
Steven Universe, a slice of life show 
about a good-hearted kid out to 
make friends and master his magical 
abilities, has a pronounced focus on 
the virtues and aspects of femininity. 
Four of the other ?ve main characters 
are female, and each has a unique 
and well-developed personality. Sim-
ilarly, the newest iteration of My Little 
Pony has (unsurprisingly) an almost 
completely female cast, but none of 
the “girlish” icons of ’80s female tele-
vision dominate.
That’s not to say that either Steven 
Universe or My Little Pony denigrate 
“girly” things — far from it. The im-
portant part, though, is that neither 
tries to really limit what “feminin-
ity” really is. Femininity might mean 
playing with dolls and dressing up 
for parties, but it might also mean 
reading science ?ction or being a 
party animal. Or it might mean kick-
ing some serious butt. The female 
characters of both shows avoid limit-
ing themselves, and in doing so pro-
vide role models for young girls who 
might want to emulate them.
But girlishness isn’t the only thing 
that new cartoons have embraced. 
We’ve also seen a slow but steady ac-
ceptance of LGBTQ people and cou-
ples in media as more and more peo-
ple come to view gay rights as human 
rights. Steven Universe — without 
spoiling — outright depicts one les-
bian relationship, and strongly hints 
at another. Meanwhile, The Legend of 
Korra, the steampunk spinoff of the 
original Avatar: The Last Airbender, 
ended with the hint of a same-sex 
relationship between two of its lead-
ing female characters. It might not be 
a wedding, but it’s certainly on the 
right track.
Can we all pack up and go home, 
then, congratulating ourselves on 
a job well done? Not quite. It’s un-
doubtedly an important step forward 
to depict queer role models for little 
girls, but queer male representation 
is still at a premium in even adult 
television. Racially, shows like Steven 
Universe have done a lot to integrate 
black, Asian, and Hispanic characters 
into their stories as a natural part of 
the animated population, but one 
look at the top ?ve cartoons today 
show that we’ve yet to move away 
from the archetype of the young, 
white, male protagonist. 
More representation is always 
positive, and it’s never good to dis-
miss progress that hasn’t gone far 
enough. But there are still kids out 
there without proper role models, 
without anyone to tell them that 
they matter, or that they’re not alone. 
Shows like The Legend of Korra have 
already made great progress by 
showing that there’s a real audience 
for shows with a female, non-hetero-
sexual protagonist of color. Maybe by 
2020, we’ll have a black protagonist, 
a trans character, or even an explicit 
same-sex relationship. But it won’t 
happen if either creators or audience 
sit back and applaud themselves on 
their laurels. 
The last ?ve years have been a 
golden age of cartoons and televi-
sion in general, no small thanks to 
the writers who’ve worked so hard 
to make real, genuine characters and 
inclusive storytelling. Let’s just hope 
that it keeps getting better from here.
ABIGAIL SMITH
Special to The Tartan
As I sat on the third ?oor of Hunt 
Library last year, I heard vaguely 
loud Gospel music playing from be-
hind me. Instinctively, in my intense 
third-?oor mode, I turned to tell 
the person to turn the music down. 
Instead, my eyes met the smile of 
a custodial worker, dancing as she 
took out the trash. It was the start of 
a very unique and special friendship.
Anna,* who wishes to remain 
anonymous, works the night shift, 11 
p.m. to 7 a.m., scrubbing bathroom 
?oors and dragging out mountains 
of trash. Every day I talked to her 
about her work and her ?ve-year-old 
son, and I am continually amazed 
by her hard work, dedication, and 
positivity.
College students are gross. It’s an 
accepted fact; many of us leave cups 
and wrappers behind without think-
ing about the men and women that 
will clean up later. 
I asked Anna if she minds clean-
ing up the seemingly never-ending 
mess. She smiled and said, “At ?rst, 
I would get frustrated when trash 
would be everywhere around the 
trashcan. But then I realized: it’s job 
security.”
With more sincerity however, 
“job security” has become a recent 
source of concern for our custodial 
staff. Carnegie Mellon switched 
from ISS to a new contractor known 
as ARAMARK in January, and since 
that shift there have been a number 
of concerns raised by the custodial 
workers about their new employer.
ARAMARK is against union and 
non-union workers working the same 
shifts, which is proving to be a prob-
lem as the contractor has hired many 
non-union workers from a temp 
agency. As a union worker, Anna 
worries that her job may be in dan-
ger. Even more troublesome, howev-
er, is the potential pay decrease; the 
contractor has threatened to cut cus-
todians’ wages by almost 40 percent, 
even for those who have had the job 
for over 10 years.
“We cannot support our families 
with that much of a decreased sal-
ary,” Anna said. “We are already liv-
ing paycheck to paycheck.” One day, 
Anna came to campus to pick up her 
paycheck. When it was not waiting 
in her mailbox, she realized that she 
would not have enough bus fare to 
make it to work later that evening.
Workers have additionally raised 
concerns about the lack of com-
munication between them and the 
contractor. Often, staff members are 
forced to clean areas by themselves 
that would normally require two to 
three workers. Requests for appro-
priate cleaning supplies are not met 
promptly. Paychecks do not come on 
schedule. Put simply, the workers 
“know what works and the employer 
does not.”
“We’ve been here longer than 
they have, yet they continually have 
demonstrated that they do not value 
our opinions. The ‘big guys’ just don’t 
listen to the ‘little guys,’ ” said Anna.
There have been recent rallies 
and protests about a similar situa-
tion at the University of Pittsburgh. 
About two weeks ago, the contract 
for University of Pittsburgh custo-
dial employees expired. The more 
administrative employees received 
a 9 percent raise, while the workers 
continue to work outside of a solid 
contract.
“Thinking about it just makes me 
want to not go to work sometime,” 
Anna said. “We are here, we are at 
the front line. We just want our voic-
es to be heard.”
Anna values being a member of 
the campus community like no other. 
“I have had the opportunity to meet 
many students and faculty. This is 
my home away from home.”
It’s time that we, too, start 
viewing our custodial staff as 
part of our Carnegie Mel-
lon family. It seems that 
far too often we are ab-
sorbed in our own stu-
dious bubble, and for-
get about those who 
have occupations 
that we will prob-
ably never have. 
What 
can we 
do as stu-
dents? Talk to 
them. Make them 
know that they are 
important too.
If this is something that matters 
to us, we need to talk about it. Con-
versations at Carnegie Mellon often 
turn very self-centered: What about 
our tuition? What about our schol-
arship money and our endowment? 
Shift the conversation. What about 
the livelihoods of those who work 
here? Maybe then the “big guys” will 
listen.
Anna said it best: “I see all of 
the students as my own children. 
Would I want my son living in a 
home that isn’t clean? At the end 
of the day, it’s about the students 
and making this campus better.”

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
CMU’s custodial staff deserve fair pay, appreciation from community 
“Golden Age” of diverse cartoons must not lose momentum
Ben Hammer/Junior Artist

STUDENT DIVERSITY COMMITTEE
Special to The Tartan
We write in regards to the recent 
ongoing conversations about diver-
sity, inspired by the March 16 Stra-
tegic Planning Town Hall Forum.
As many of you know, on March 22 
Juan Acosta published an article in 
The Tartan calling for campus lead-
ers to seriously commit to diversity 
efforts. As a result, undergraduate 
and graduate students, supported 
by staff and administration, united 
as a Student Diversity Committee.
We recognize that it is everyone’s 
responsibility, including students’, 
to play a role in fostering a diverse 
campus community. As a result, we 
did our part by hosting two student-
driven Diversity Forums on April 
9 and April 10. This letter seeks to 
elevate the voices of students who 
participated in the forums and calls 
on Carnegie Mellon’s leadership to 
share in these continued efforts.
Recruiting a Diverse Student 
Body
Participants in the forums em-
phasized that expanding Carnegie 
Mellon’s socioeconomic diversity 
and representation of domestic mi-
norities is key for developing tomor-
row’s leaders. The recent changes 
to Carnegie Mellon’s underrepre-
sented minority pipeline program 
(SAMS) has many students con-
cerned that pipeline programs may 
be disappearing or getting less sup-
port.
We call on the university to com-
mit more funding and resources to 
its pipeline programs at the under-
graduate and graduate level. Spe-
ci?cally, we call on the university 
to focus on efforts such as locally 
recruiting underrepresented mi-
norities, increasing the percentage 
of Pell Grant Recipients (in 2013–14 
it was only 13 percent), and offering 
diversity-based fellowships to grad-
uate students.
Students’ Learning Experience
Another primary concern at the 
forums was the representation of 
diverse faculty and the impact on 
students’ learning experience. 
As one participant noted: “It’s 
hard to see yourself in faculty or 
staff, but easy in CulinArt.” In ad-
dition to faculty representation, the 
nature of the university’s research 
and curriculum should address is-
sues of diversity with rigor and 
continual open-ended inquiry and 
investigation.
We call on the university to pri-
oritize diversity in hiring faculty and 
ongoing support for minority em-
ployees once they are hired. We call 
on faculty from across the university 
to include structured conversations 
about diversity in their classrooms. 
Additionally, we call on deans and 
department heads to direct fund-
ing toward research that addresses 
diversity-based issues.
Extracurricular Support  
A third recurring theme in our 
discussions was the siloing of the 
student body on campus, often by 
race and culture. 
We recognize that if students 
do not engage with those who are 
different from them, then having a 
diverse population becomes mean-
ingless. This siloing of students is 
often reinforced by the structure 
of student organizations. We call 
on the university to provide more 
advising and funding support for 
campus-wide diversity program-
ming, especially between student 
organizations.
We were inspired by the great 
turnout and the level of critical 
re?ection offered by participants 
at both diversity forums. The Mil-
lennial generation, in particular, is 
critically attuned to issues of race, 
gender, class, culture, varying capa-
bilities, and sexual identity.
Students offer invaluable insight 
to Carnegie Mellon’s campus discus-
sions about diversity, and we look 
forward to seeing this insight re-
?ected in the university’s strategic 
plan and ultimate implementation.
Our heart is in the work and we 
hope yours is, too.
Student-led diversity 
conversation should 
keep growing louder

(1) Anaheim Ducks 4 – 0 
(W) Winnipeg Jets
Winnipeg hockey fans were 
seeing playoff hockey for the 
?rst time in 19 years, and the 
atmosphere inside the MTS 
Center was amazing. How-
ever, the Ducks brought too 
much talent to the table for 
crowd noise to matter and 
swept the Jets with just one 
game leaking into overtime. 
The short series bodes well for 
the Ducks, who get some valu-
able days off. 
(2) Vancouver Canucks 
2 – 4 (3) Calgary Flames
The Flames’ cinderella run 
continues after a six-game se-
ries with the Canucks. This 
series got intense after game 
one, featuring ?ghts and plen-
ty of hits, but the Flames were 
unshaken and advanced.
(1) St. Louis Blues 2 – 4 
(W) Minnesota Wild
The Wild started setting 
the NHL on ?re after acquiring 
goaltender Devan Dubnyk at 
the trade deadline. After post-
ing one of the league’s best 
second half records, they put 
up a long and hotly contested 
battle against one of hockey’s 
best teams. It was enough for a 
second round visit as the Wild 
won game six 4–1 being out-
shot 31–21 by the Blues.
(2) Nashville Predators 
2 – 4 (3) Chicago 
Blackhawks
Nashville actually out-
scored the Blackhawks in this 
series, turning in two domi-
nant games while the Black-
hawks scraped by on wins in 
double and triple overtime 
games. It’s unfair to see the 
Predators go down in a series 
where they played better, but 
luck happens in short series.
(1) Montreal Canadiens 
4 – 2 (W) Ottawa 
Senators
The Montreal Canadiens 
came in as heavy favorites, 
but a series of closely con-
tested, one-goal games left 
this matchup in reach for the 
Senators. Ottawa’s 5–1 beat-
down of Montreal in game ?ve 
remains the only convincing 
win of this series. 
In the end, however, 
Montreal had enough to win 
the series in six games.
(2) Tampa Bay Lightning 
2 – 3 (3) Detroit Red 
Wings
In a fast-paced series, the 
Lightning — hockey’s best 
offensive team all season — 
was held scoreless in games 
three and ?ve, putting the Red 
Wings on top. This series con-
tinues on Monday when the 
Red Wings have a chance to 
win on their home ice.
(1) New York Rangers 
4 – 1 (W) Pittsburgh 
Penguins
The Rangers came in with 
the President’s Trophy, and 
the Penguins came in with an 
ugly, months-long cold streak, 
making this outcome widely 
expected. However, as is often 
the case in hockey, the lopsid-
ed game count belies a close 
series. 
The Penguins held their 
own, but lost four games 2–1 
after plenty of de?ections and 
moments of luck.
(2) Washington Capitals 
3 – 3 (3) New York 
Islanders
The Isles and Caps have 
traded thrillers up to this 
point, and great goaltending 
has left three of the six games 
as one goal affairs. 
Monday’s series ?nale  
should be yet another nail-
biter.
Carnegie Mellon tennis and track compete at UAA ?nal
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
Over the weekend, the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s track and ?eld teams 
competed in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Outdoor Championships.
On Saturday, the men 
started the competition 
strong with a new school re-
cord in the 4x800-meter relay 
with junior Marc-Daniel Ju-
lien, ?rst-year Evan Larrick, 
sophomore Owen Norley, and 
senior Thomas Vandenberg 
combing for a winning time 
of 7:39.98. First-year David 
Trzcinski added to the Tar-
tan success by earning third 
place in the shot put with a 
13.90 meter heave. Vanden-
berg and Julien continued 
the Tartan domination in the 
800 meter distance with ?rst 
and second place ?nishes, 
crossing the line at 1:53.64 
and 1:54.94 respectively. In 
the 5000 meter run, senior 
George Degen ?nished fourth 
with a time of 15:15.23. In 
the ?eld events, ?rst year Ja-
cob Schofel placed second in 
the discus throw with a top 
throw of 42.47m. To ?nish off 
the day, the 4x400 relay team, 
with sophomore Nathan Wil-
lis, Julien, Norley and Van-
denberg, ?nished fourth with 
a time of 3:21.37 — less than 
.6 seconds out of second.
On the women’s side, the 
Tartans came out strong on 
Saturday, breaking three 
school records.
First-year Sarah Cook 
broke the school record in the 
400 meter dash during her 
preliminary run with a time 
of 57.65 and went on to place 
third and break the record 
again with a time of 57.22 on 
Sunday. In the 4x800 meter 
relay, senior Sara Kelly, soph-
omore Ariel Tian, Cook, and 
junior Erin Kiekhaefer placed 
?fth but broke the school re-
cord by over 10 seconds with 
a ?nal time of 9:22.34.
In the pole vault, sopho-
more Grace Yee took ?rst 
place and broke her own 
school record with her 3.40m 
leap. Senior Sasha Spalding 
took second in the long jump 
with her 5.20 meter bound to 
continue the Tartans success 
in the ?eld events.
In the 4x100 meter relay 
on Sunday, sophomore Jerilyn 
James, Cook, Tian and Spald-
ing placed third with a time of 
49.23. In the 1500 meter run, 
Kiekhaefer took second with a 
?nal time of 4:39.84 and then 
fourth as part of 4x400 relay 
with James, Tian and Cook, 
crossing the line in 3:59.25.
Overall, both squads 
placed sixth out of seven 
schools with the men rack-
ing up 90 team points and the 
women earning 65.
Both tennis teams for 
Carnegie Mellon competed in 
the UAA Championships this 
weekend as well.
The women’s team is 
ranked seventh in the nation 
and faced stark competition. 
They easily dispatched Roch-
ester 8–1 in the ?rst round, 
but had a much tougher time 
pulling out a victory against 
11th-ranked Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis, coming 
from behind to squeak out the 
5–4 victory.
In the ?nals, the Tartans 
faced off against second-
ranked Emory University, 
which had defeated the Tar-
tans in the ?nals the last two 
years. Senior Bryn Raschke 
and ?rst-year Cori Sidell were 
able to pull out a point in dou-
ble play, but Carnegie Mellon 
was still down 2–1 going into 
the singles play. There they 
lost 4 points in straight sets 
and a ?fth in a tie break to 
crush any title hopes. Sopho-
more Vanessa Pavia gained 
the only singles point for the 
Tartans with her 6–2, 6–3 
straight set victory as Carn-
egie Mellon fell 7–2.
The 10th-ranked men had 
high expectations after beat-
ing 29th-ranked Brandeis 
University in the ?rst round 
7–2, but against ?fth-ranked 
Washington University in St. 
Louis, the Tartans fell 7–2, 
with the only points coming 
from junior Abshiek Alla and 
sophomore Kiril Kirkov, who 
both needed tiebreaker sets.
In the third place game, 
Carnegie Mellon completely 
unraveled and fell 8–1 against 
13th-ranked University of 
Chicago, with senior Chris-
tian Heaney-Secord earning 
the sole point.
Both teams will next look 
to play in the NCAA DIII Ten-
nis Championships, with bids 
announced next Monday, 
May 4.
Machika Kaku dives into successful pair of seasons
Early returns set the scene for Tigers, Mets playoff runs
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
As April comes to a close, 
nearly every bit of information 
we have about baseball is use-
less. Over the course of a 162-
game season, it’s a fool’s er-
rand to try to make long-term 
predictions based on early 
season trends. However, early 
season madness can some-
times change the picture of a 
season in a meaningful way. 
This year, two crowded races 
— the battle for the American 
League (AL) Central crown 
and the struggle for the Na-
tional League (NL) Wild Card 
— could have seen the favor-
ites change due to some early 
season surprises.
Early season swings cause 
changes in close races. Say a 
team would normally be ex-
pected to win 81 games in a 
season. This would mean it 
wins 50 percent of its games. 
If that team wins its ?rst ten 
games, their talent level did 
not change, but those games 
count. Now, instead of 81 
games, that team is expected 
to win 86.
That random hot streak 
has an impact on the playoff 
position of that team.
Saying the hot streak will 
level out in the long run is 
true, but the season is not long 
enough to render those ten 
games irrelevant. Further, the 
team is not more likely to ex-
perience a random cold streak 
because they had a random 
hot streak. This is the gam-
bler’s fallacy. The early season 
successes of two teams, the 
Detroit Tigers and the New 
York Mets, have massively im-
proved those teams’ chances 
to get in on the MLB playoffs.
In the AL Central, four 
teams — the Tigers, Kansas 
City Royals, Cleveland Indi-
ans, and Chicago White Sox 
— all had their sights set on a 
division crown. While projec-
tion systems were less kind 
to the Royals despite their AL 
pennant from last season, the 
Tigers, Indians, and White Sox 
were all projected by Baseball 
Prospectus’ PECOTA, Clay 
Davenport, and Vegas lines 
to ?nish with only a couple 
games between them. The 
Royals were projected to ?nd 
themselves a bit back of the 
pack. However, with a fast 
start, the Tigers have pulled 
?ve games ahead of both the 
Indians and White Sox. The 
Royals, who have matched the 
Tigers so far, may have been 
underrated by the preseason 
projections.
Even if they were not, 
this random hot streak has 
put them in position to ?nish 
about level with the Indians 
and White Sox, putting them 
back in contention for the 
Wild Card race in the AL. This 
is not a big upset considering 
expectations, as the White 
Sox and Indians were relying 
on younger players taking a 
step forward. This doesn’t al-
ways happen, and it means 
that both teams are likely to 
improve as the season goes 
along. However, if both teams 
?nish with the same record as 
the Tigers in a vacuum, that 
?ve game league is likely to 
hold over the remaining 145 
or so games.
A stacked ?eld featuring 
the San Diego Padres, Chica-
go Cubs, Miami Marlins, and 
whoever between the Pitts-
burgh Pirates and St. Louis 
Cardinals misses out on the NL 
Central crown was supposed 
to have a season-long scrum 
for the two spots in the NL 
Wild Card playoff game. The 
Cardinals and Pirates were 
expected to ?nish with some-
where between 89 and 93 
wins, but one of them would 
win the NL Central. That 
means that one spot would be 
left for the rest of the ?eld, all 
of whom were often projected 
to ?nish in the 83 to 85 win 
range.
Just behind those four 
teams was supposed to be the 
Mets, a .500 team with some 
great pitching but little else 
better than average. The Mets 
had other ideas, however, 
as they burst out of the gate 
with a 13–3 start. Considering 
their projections, prorated to a 
whole season, the Mets would 
then be expected to follow 
that start with .500 baseball 
and ?nish with 86 wins.
With none of the other wild 
card teams performing ac-
cording to expectations so far, 
the Mets’ 86 expected wins 
seems to have launched them 
not only into the conversation, 
but maybe even the pole posi-
tion. The Marlins have been 
horrible out of the gate, and 
in a crowded race a cold streak 
can be death. Slow starts have 
left the Cubs and Pirates hov-
ering around .500, so consid-
ering preseason expectations, 
the Cubs are likely an 83-win 
team and the Pirates an 87-
win team. The Padres have 
been good to begin the season, 
but they did not project more 
than two games better than 
the Mets coming in and sit 
three games back right now. 
The Mets are being tested ear-
ly with injuries to third base-
man David Wright and catcher 
Travis D’Arnaud, but starters 
Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, 
and Bartolo Colon can help 
the team go a long way, and 
highly rated prospect, starter 
Noah Syndergaard, is wait-
ing in the wings. These Mets 
might be able to put a playoff 
run together this season.
Of course, it’s only April, 
and small sample size wonki-
ness happens during every 
small sample over the course 
of a season. Injuries might 
derail the Mets, or all of those 
teams might go on even more 
impressive runs. Either way, 
what seemed like an exciting 
and close MLB season looks 
even closer one month in.

If you’ve kept up with The 
Tartan, you may have noticed 
that this semester has fea-
tured quite a large number of 
athlete pro?les. These pro?les 
delve into how the student 
athletes at Carnegie Mellon 
have been able to survive 
the academic rigors we all 
share while devoting a con-
siderable amount of time into 
something they have a pas-
sion for. While that passion 
doesn’t have to be a sport, 
these young men and women 
lead balanced, complete lives, 
and sophomore diver Ma-
chika Kaku is no exception. 
She, like all the athletes who 
have been featured over the 
course of this semester, exem-
pli?es what it means to be a 
Tartan: being able to handle 
a demanding workload with-
out sacri?cing the things that 
bring enjoyment to life.
In Kaku’s case, sports have 
been that part of her life that 
balances out everything else. 
“I’ve been active since I could 
walk,” the biology and cre-
ative writing double major 
said. Growing up in Irvine, 
California, Kaku spent a lot 
of time roller blading, sur?ng, 
and rock climbing recreation-
ally. When she eventually 
moved toward team sports, 
she initially gravitated toward 
gymnastics. She soon discov-
ered aspects of the sport she 
liked, such as the team spirit 
and unity, and those that she 
did not, such as the level of 
competitiveness and rates of 
injury, leading her to choose 
diving. “Water is a lot more 
forgiving than a concrete 
?oor,” Kaku said.
Although Kaku was the 
only diver on her high school’s 
swimming and diving team, 
she felt like part of a family 
with the swimmers. She at-
tributes this welcome to the 
school’s pride in swimming; 
the team often won their state 
championships. This type 
of group environment was 
something she sought from 
college programs as she pre-
pared to search for her home 
after high school. Between 
Carnegie Mellon and a local 
Division II school, she chose 
the former to focus more on 
academics and to begin an ad-
venture away from home.
At Carnegie Mellon, Kaku 
hoped to see as cohesive a 
team as she had come to ex-
pect from her previous years. 
“I made it a point to get to 
know the swimmers.”
She was not disappointed. 
Kaku arrived at a time where 
the swimmers and divers 
thought of themselves as one 
team. “Apparently before, 
they never spoke to each oth-
er. I was glad that they were 
now a team,” she said.
During her ?rst year with 
the team, Kaku managed to 
make it to the regional level 
of competition, though she 
was the only member of the 
team who had achieved the 
minimum score to do so. “I 
was so nervous; I did really 
badly,” she said. This year, 
however, Kaku managed to 
?nish in fourth place in the 
regional competition, mak-
ing it to the national compe-
tition. She credited the two 
teammates who made it with 
her to regionals for giving her 
the sense of camaraderie she 
needed to do her best. “I felt 
comfortable with my team-
mates around,” she said.
She was excited to make 
nationals, especially consid-
ering she almost wasn’t al-
lowed to participate in the 
regional competition. “I had 
a concussion before region-
als,” she said. She was only 
cleared to return to practice 
shortly before the regional 
competition began. For her, 
being able to make the most 
out of her opportunity to play 
made the victory one of her 
proudest accomplishments. 
With Carnegie Mellon host-
ing regionals next year, mean-
ing that the team won’t have 
to travel to New York as they 
have in previous years, Kaku 
believes she and the team can 
do even better.
In the meantime, Kaku will 
be continuing research at the 
Minden Lab in Mellon Insti-
tute. She is currently trying to 
?nd protein bio-markers that 
causes those with rheumatoid 
arthritis to develop Interstitial 
Lung Disease.
Whether she’s devoting 
time to her sport, working in 
the research lab, or hanging 
out and enjoying a good time, 
Kaku represents someone 
who has de?ned being a Tar-
tan in her own way.

Love, Betrayal, Deceit 
Othello, playing at the Pittsburgh Public Theater, intrigues the mind
I was very intrigued when I first heard Othello, 
written by William Shakespeare and directed by 
Ted Pappas, was playing at the Pittsburgh Public 
Theater. Othello is one of those really famous 
Shakespearean plays (although, to be fair, which 
one of Shakespeare’s plays isn’t famous?). This one 
falls in with Macbeth and King Lear and all of the 
really serious, really awesome Shakespeare plays. 
If you find yourself attending the play without prior 
knowledge, I would suggest you Google Othello 
before you go or you will totally be lost in the first 
act. Also you may want to read the plot summary 
before reading this review. Just a suggestion.
Even if you do read the book in its entirety, I’m 
pretty sure you’ll still find the first act rough. Like, 
actors tripping on lines rough. When I was sitting 
through it, I was really worried that this play was 
going to be torture — and let’s face it, writing a 
bad review of Shakespeare is basically asking to be 
called a jerk. I understand that introductions must 
be made and the scene set, but I think the actors 
found the first act boring, too. Many of them seemed 
to be spitting out their lines as fast as they possibly 
could (hence my suggestion of reading up before the 
production).
The visual element does not really help at all. Sets 
at the public theater are always interesting because 
of the open floor plan and lack of curtain, meaning 
that part of the set must always remain. Yet this set 
is extremely sparse and seemingly has no relation to 
the play. It consisted of a frame made of steel beams 
set in stone, with the rest of the background made 
up of gray stained planks. It appears somewhat 
modern, with kind of a Scandinavian minimalist 
design. Yet the program and costumes indicated 
the setting was the mid-19th century. I have no idea 
why the mid-19th century, because this seemed 
to serve no purpose either. Having seen the 2010 
production of Midsummer Night’s Dream at the 
Public Theater, my only guess is that Ted Pappas, 
who directed both productions, really has a thing 
for setting Shakespearean plays in the 19th century. 
From an audience’s perspective, it certainly does 
nothing to detract from the performance, but also 
nothing to enhance it.
At this point you must be thinking that I absolutely 
hated this production, but actually walking out 
of the theater, I have to say that I really enjoyed 
it. While it may have had its rough spots during 
the first act, everything comes together after that. 
Suddenly the characters take on new realness, and 
we get to really know Iago, perhaps one of the most 
interesting villains ever written. Jeremy Kushnier 
did a really excellent job with his role. His changing 
vocal inflections did a nice job of highlighting the 
deceit Iago weaves around the other characters. 
I only wish that Kushnier had highlighted the 
psychopathic elements of Iago more, to make him 
a bit scarier and a bit more demented. Overall, 
however, Kushnier’s performance was engaging.
I have to say, I have a particular soft spot for the 
role of Emilia. Played by Jessica Wortham, Emilia, 
Iago’s wife and lady-in-waiting to Desdemona, 
kicks some serious butt. When she goes on about 
women essentially being the equal of men you kind 
of half expect some weird time travel element to 
be at hand — sorry, Outlander fans, no such thing 
here. You find yourself thinking to yourself: “Really? 
Shakespeare wrote that? No!” I mean seriously, I 
never would have thought anything that progressive 
could be found in a 17th-century play. But yes, it’s 
true, and the dramatic irony in about half her lines 
also makes her character one of the more amusing 
ones. But ultimately, Emilia stands her ground and 
fights for justice. So what if Iago knifes her in the 
back? She already made sure that Iago would get his 
just desserts. Badass.
Teagle F. Bougere, playing the title role of Othello, 
was also a show stopper. You could feel the energy 
he was putting into the performance. Bougere is 
able to make you see almost every facet of Othello. 
Sometimes arrogant, sometimes endearing, 
sometimes mildly psychotic, and seriously misled, 
Othello is a rich character that you could spend 
forever analyzing, and Bougere makes you see each 
part. Matched up with Amanda Leigh Cobb in the 
role of Desdemona, the two bring such chemistry to 
these leading roles as to make the final sequence 
truly heart wrenching. I have never before walked 
away from a play feeling bad for a character who 
committed murder, but Othello is not your standard 
murderer.
Ultimately, like most of Shakespeare’s great works, 
Othello is exceptionally rich, and the production 
currently at the Public Theater does not disappoint.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
Senior year, post-
Carnival: I’m suffering 
from a more-than-mild 
existential crisis. I’ve 
grown to hate school; 
heck, part of the 
culture at Carnegie 
Mellon is that you’re 
so, so ready to work 
less hard than you did 
here, and out of that, 
people grow to resent 
this place. Despite 
that, bubbling to my 
emotional surface is a 
feeling that I’m going to 
miss this sorry school 
— with its nerd culture, 
odd traditions, and 
misguided priorities — 
for the rest of my days.
How should I go about 
spending my last few 
weeks at Carnegie 
Mellon to make my 
collegiate experience 
complete?
With mixed feelings,
Reaching End of 
Academic Life, Tense 
And Looking for 
Komfort
Dear REAL TALK,
Well, if you’ve never been 
to Tazza d’Oro at the 
bottom of Gates, then 
you could eat there. And 
I guess you should go 
to Razzy Fresh at least 
once, too… oh, wait; you 
probably want to do more 
than just eat food. That’s 
a little tougher to answer.
You’re probably doing 
this already, but avoid 
homework like the plague 
until at most 24 hours 
before it’s due. If you 
already have a job or 
internship lined up, and 
you don’t plan on going 
to grad school, then you 
don’t really need to be 
doing anything except 
enjoying your time here.
Your best bet at making 
the most of your time 
before commencement 
is to hang out with as 
many estranged friends 
as possible — people 
you met in your first and 
sophomore years and 
connected with but then 
never made the mutual 
effort to foster a true 
friendship. Try to make as 
many positive personal 
connections as possible, 
and if one of those people 
ends up complaining 
about not having seen 
you in so long, then you 
can let them go without a 
colored conscience.
I know my usual advice 
is to stay in, eat, and play 
video games, but I’m 
going to break my own 
rules here: Get out of the 
house. See Phipps; go to 
the Altar Bar, Heinz Hall, 
the Incline, Fallingwater. 
Be a tourist.
Also, I in no way condone 
climbing onto the roof of 
Hamerschlag Hall, or any 
other academic building 
— but I’ve heard it’s kinda 
fun.
Pittsburgh will miss 
you, too,
Evan Kahn

From four years writing reviews for The Tartan, here’s 
my list of the best of the best:
Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA): Storyteller: 
Photographs of Duane Michals
I’ve never wanted to milk an exhibit dry as I have 
Storyteller. Michals isn’t just a photographer; he’s a 
craftsman, piecing together stories with whatever 
media he has available. His work is simultaneously 
artful and activist, simple and deeply thought 
provoking. And there’s a lot of it. That’s where the 
masterful touch of CMOA curators came into play: 
How to build an exhibit that both organizes all there 
is to display, and guide us through such that we 
discover the genius for what it is? This one was pretty 
perfect. I went back again and again before it closed 
in February.
Faculty Interview: Reza Vali
When I sat down with Professor of Composition 
Reza Vali in February 2014, I expected to learn about 
“Elements,” the piece he had co-composed that 
was due to premiere with the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra that month. Instead, I got a story — nearly 
unbelievable in its scope — spun in the whining half-
tones of the Persian melodies from Vali’s youth. Vali 
told me about dastgah, the Persian music system, and 
his mission to create a Western instrument that could 
play the notes-between-notes that color those classic 
tunes. This interview changed me. It’s an inspiring 
reminder that our campus is scattered all over with 
hidden diamonds, faculty who are literal icons in their 
?elds.
Carnegie Museum of Natural History: Roads of 
Arabia
Tied with Storyteller, Roads of Arabia is one of my 
favorite exhibits I’ve seen grace either Carnegie 
museum. There’s something remarkable about 
an exhibit that takes you out of your habitat and 
places you so wholly and seamlessly into another. 
Maybe it was the 6,000-year-old anthropomorphic 
steles guarding the doors, their wizened human 
expressions speaking sadness, that made me feel a 
desert wanderer myself. The curators at the Carnegie 
museums know how to stun with their material, and 
Roads of Arabia — in its understated way — has been 
one of their best.
wats:ON? Festival 2013: NOISE
Not every act during this festival was my favorite. In 
fact, I found one of them downright intolerable. But 
when I was a guest at wats:ON?, I felt like an insider 
on some big secret. At wats:ON, artists, and students 
met and shared their work, opened their eyes to new 
sights and sounds. I saw projects I didn’t expect to 
see, and will probably never see again. It had the feel 
of an exclusive, art-sharing club when in reality, it was 
incredibly accessible, hosted in the College of Fine 
Arts and entirely free to attend.
The Mattress Factory: Gestures
It seems not many students venture to the Mexican 
War Streets neighborhood, weaving through the 
artfully painted row houses to ?nd the hidden treasure 
that is the Mattress Factory, a museum of exclusively 
installation art. What does installation art mean? 
The art isn’t con?ned to frames and canvases: It 
creeps into the viewer space until it surrounds you. 
Gestures was one of the most vivid examples of this 
when it opened in April 2012, with rooms ?lled with 
rope dangling from the ceiling and apple-red balloons 
you took outside and lifted to the sky. The Mattress 
Factory rotates through exhibits excruciatingly slowly, 
with maybe one or two openings a semester at most. 
But when these openings happen, they’re worth the 
trip.
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra: Anne-Sophie 
Mutter
Violin soloist Anne-Sophie Mutter dazzled in this 
September 2011 performance with the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra, but the PSO itself stunned me 
more. I discovered the Symphony was wonderful, 
and thought maybe I could start writing about it. 
I’ve been to see the PSO many, many times since, 
and every time they blow me away. With the ability 
to consistently bring world-class soloists to the 
Steel City, the PSO’s best asset is its own talent. 
When concertmaster Noah Bendix-Balgley picks up 
his violin, his nectar-sweet sound ?oors me every 
time. I’m probably one of very few in saying that the 
Symphony has become one of my top destinations as 
a college student. But they’ve never disappointed me, 
and I ?nd myself newly inspired every time I go.

In 2003, 20th Century Fox released a movie about the 
Daredevil, and it was just that: a movie about a comic book 
character that offered a lot of action, some big names — Ben 
Af?eck, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Garner — and very little 
character development. The current TV show that started 
on Net?ix on April 10 does bring a lot of action, but it brings 
much more character development, a deep and rich origin 
story, and little-known names to play the characters. These 
characters, like some other comic book characters, are very 
complex and nuanced, which is why the serial format — 
comic book or television show — is very useful.
The origin story is about a boy who loses his sight, but in 
the process acquires superhuman hearing. The hearing is so 
enhanced that he is able to see using a radar sense. Unlike 
the movie, the TV show focuses on how the boy becomes 
the vigilante and how the vigilante becomes the hero. In 
other words, the show focuses on the character development 
that the movie missed. Of course we must consider the 
fact that the movie has at most 2 hours to provide enough 
context and backstory so that people can care about the 
characters in question, and they do have to hit some people 
and make it exciting enough to be a blockbuster. It is a lot to 
pack into a two hour ?lm, and 20th Century Fox at that time 
did not have the best track record with doing this — take X2 
and X-Men: The Last Stand as examples. This is the main 
reason why the serial format is much better for development.
Daredevil, however, brings something new to the game. 
While many TV shows about superheroes start at the point 
where the hero has his unrealistic costume already made 
and a back-up team already formed, this program starts off 
when Matt Murdock is simply a blind lawyer by day and a 
masked vigilante at night, without weapons or any actual 
practice with vigilante justice. We see him get beat up a 
lot, we see him lose, we see him learn, and we see him 
become the hero that he must become. This, paired with 
some ?ashbacks of his childhood, provide a lot of information 
about the character and why Matt is the way that he is. The 
show doesn’t only focus on him, it also brings forth his old 
trainer, Stick (another blind man with radar sense who hasn’t 
aged in 20 years — hint: This might indicate he has all the 
superpowers from the comic version). The Stick’s presence 
could also indicate future work with The Hand and The 
Chaste, organizations in the Marvel universe that Daredevil 
has been involved in. Some foreshadowing in the show has 
also indicated that more characters are set to become part 
of the storyline and that it will link with many of the other 
Marvel Cinematic Universe elements.
The show also brings the law aspect into play; since Matt 
is a lawyer by day, he is also seen forming his of?ce and 
working with his partner to solve cases and help others in 
Hell’s Kitchen. Finally, one of the more interesting aspects 
of the show is that even with all of the focus on character 
development and complex storytelling, it brings high action 
elements and highlights the artistry behind a really good 
?ght scene. The program has some of the best ?ght scenes I 
have ever seen. Compared to other superhero shows — and 
even big-budget movies — they are ealistic and intense, 
as well as gripping and non-cliché. Since the program 
shows you the story from the time when Matt wasn’t very 
experienced with ?ghting, you do see him struggle against 
thugs and criminals, but also you see him showcase his 
martial arts training.

Net?ix-produced Marvel television series brings new level of depth to the comics
“So, what are you doing this summer?” Ah, that loathsome, 
inescapable question. There are only a couple weeks of the 
semester left and, if you’re lucky, you have your summer 
plans set right now. Some of you probably landed that 
big-bucks, knockout internship way back in January (I’m 
looking at you, CS majors). If you are one of these people, I 
salute you and your peace of mind — my insane jealously 
notwithstanding.
Meanwhile, there are the rest of us. We, the increasingly 
panicked hordes, are still waiting on job leads and the couple 
or couple dozen ?shing lines (résumés, cover letters, and 
applications) we’ve ?ung into the void. If you’re like me 
(eternally thinking, “Well, there’s still time”), I sincerely hope 
you end up catching something.
But even if you don’t, hang on to the fact that it won’t be 
the end of the world. With a little motivation and creative 
thinking, you can de?nitely make this summer worthwhile. 
Here are just a few options:
1) Start a project.
Now that outside forces have stopped throwing work at you, 
why not give yourself some work? It’s amazing how quickly 
doing nothing can become soul-crushingly boring. Build a 
website, or — if you’re technologically incapable of that — 
start by picking up some HTML on Code Academy. Write 
that novel you’ve been dreaming of. Read ten whole books. 
Learn how to play “Wonderwall” on guitar and experience 
the joy of being “that guy.” You’ll collect some new skills 
to give next year’s résumé more of a ?ghting chance. Plus, 
you’ll build yourself into a more well-rounded and interesting 
person. Or whatever.
2) Get healthy.
It’s true — all that you need in order to have a “bathing suit 
body” is to put a bathing suit on your body. That said, this 
could be the summer when you ?nally do get in shape. Take 
advantage of the best season for fresh fruit. Eat some salad; 
get over the fact that salad will always be on some level 
disappointing. Get a three-month gym membership, or take 
some ?ve dollar Yoga to the People classes (marvel at the fact 
that woah, you can actually get your leg up there). For the 
more economical alternative, watch just a few of the Zumba 
videos that seem to proliferate Youtube; sweat like a pig, look 
like an idiot, and revel in it all.
3) Go outside.
Most of what’s fun about summer is not con?ned to your 
(hopefully air-conditioned) home. Wherever you happen to 
be, there is de?nitely an awesome concert heading your way, 
from SummerStage festival in New York City (which runs 
through August and is mostly free) to the tons of individual 
bands that will be rolling through Pittsburgh. You should 
also probably hit up a beach at some point, or bike/drive up 
to the nearest river and have a picnic if you’re feeling more 
adventurous. Re-cement your bonds with friends back home. 
Nature is pretty cool, actually.
4) Make money.
It’s actually easier than you’d expect to earn a few bucks over 
the summer. You could always go the $7.25 an hour barista 
route (it’s a pretty valuable life experience, in my opinion), 
but there are also tons of smaller jobs you can pick up or 
create for yourself. Put up a poster in your building offering 
your services, whether it be some kind of sitting (baby, pet, 
plant, etc.), tutoring (though any kid who actually has to learn 
over the summer will probably be a handful), or computer 
help (“Have you tried turning it off and then on again, 
Mrs. Jenkins?”). Keep your eyes open for freelance work. 
Opportunities tend to pop up in the most unexpected places.
5) Embrace the rage.
Even now that you’ve learned some things, had some fun, 
and gotten ripped, it might still be hard to swallow the 
bitterness that you were forced to throw together a decent 
summer from scratch. Realize that joblessness, unpaid 
internships, and massive debt are the burden of college 
students everywhere. Realize that this generation works 
its butt off with little credit. Let that anger empower you to 
make next summer an even better one.
Alright, I’m off to frantically check my email, send out a 
dozen more applications, and cry my way toward ?nals 
week. Best of luck to you all!

6musical
pillbox 04.27.15
Last Friday, I had the privilege of attending the 
opening night of Guts, a small musical built from the 
ground up at Carnegie Mellon University. Performed 
in Kresge Auditorium within the College of Fine 
Arts in front of not more than seventy people, Guts 
was an immensely moving experience. I walked out 
with a broken smile on my face, and a ton of big 
ideas in my mind. Written by senior electrical and 
computer engineering major Brad Plaxen, with music 
by senior chemical engineering major Alex Petti, and 
directed by senior professional writing and global 
studies double major Razghiem Golden, Guts, is a 
post-apocalyptic zombie story like no other. The play 
follows a small group that has survived for ten years 
inside the con?nes of the protective but oppressive 
Bunker 63.
Rules and routine, the cornerstones of the group’s 
survival strategy, are thrown out the window when 
an outsider enters the bunker. This outsider is no 
ordinary survivor, and the aftermath of his arrival 
brings out the best and the worst in the bunker’s 
inhabitants. Some of them welcome the change he 
is the harbinger of, while others resent it. Everybody 
makes decisions — some wise and some unwise, 
some brave and some cowardly — that go on to have 
repercussions for the group as a whole. In the wake 
of what follows, fundamental questions about life are 
brought to the fore. What does it mean to be alive? Is 
surviving the same as living? If the zombies are up 
there, and can see the sun and feel the grass, while 
we’re down here in a little bunker, who’s really dead: 
them or us?
Even though zombies dominate the narrative 
throughout, not once does one actually appear on 
stage. Because of this, in spite of being such a central 
focus of the script, the zombies are but a means to 
another, more universally relevant theme: breaking 
free from fear and reaching for something more than 
just surviving. On this level, Guts thrives in its ability 
to resonate with us; who hasn’t felt trapped, whether 
it’s in the wrong major, a sad job, with misunderstood 
friends, or in a loveless relationship?
The attention to detail that the writers, director, and 
cast brought to Guts is incredible for the small scale 
of the show. The subtlest of glances and mannerisms 
give clues to characters’ motivations. Every one of 
the nine characters is meticulously considered and 
developed. In one spectacularly put together scene, 
two characters are spilling their hearts out to each 
other about a perceived lack of affection from their 
respective signi?cant others. In the background, the 
silhouettes of the aforementioned others are seen 
getting intimate with each other. In another scene of 
unbelievable poignance, an infected character needs 
to be euthanized. The group, completely fractured by 
that point, gets into a heated argument on how to kill 
him, in front of his horri?ed eyes.
This attention to details is equally prevalent in the 
music. “Musical” isn’t the ?rst thing that comes 
to mind when someone says “zombie apocalypse,” 
yet the importance of the music in Guts cannot be 
overstated. In so many scenarios, lyrics and melody 
effectively express sentiments that would seem heavy-
handed and tacky if expressed through dialogue. The 
music itself comes across as effortless and earnest. A 
sparse ensemble consisting of a drummer, a guitarist, 
a pianist and two violinists put together what can 
best be described as a mixture of alternative rock and 
more traditional musical theater. The simplicity of 
the music complements the unpretentiousness and 
sincerity of the script well. This, combined with the 
natural intimacy of Kresge Auditorium, adds up to 
an experience that is less like watching a fancy bells 
and whistles production, and more like watching a 
bunch of your close friends put up something that is 
obviously deeply important to them.
That said, Guts is unabashedly a “rough around the 
edges” student production — don’t go in expecting 
Broadway. The set is a single room of Bunker 63 with 
a dining table, a radio, and scaffolding hung rags for 
walls. While watching Guts, every once in a while, 
I heard a note that was ever so slightly off key or 
off time. The tech setup wasn’t the greatest either. 
Monitor feedback aside, two characters’ mics got 
completely cut off in one slightly embarrassing scene. 
Ultimately though, even these little fumbles only 
added to the overall vibe that Guts was succeeding in 
building.
On the back of a brilliant story, some whip-smart 
dialogue and heartfelt music, Guts clicks in a way that 
nothing this casual has any right to. Considering the 
constraints it works in, Guts accomplishes amazing 
things. A big budget adaptation would spruce up the 
set, spruce up the sound mixing, and play in a much 
bigger space than Kresge. Yet, for all the gains that 
such an adaptation would make, I believe it’d lose 
even more. You see, more than anything else, Guts 
moved me by the sheer emotional weight of its pure, 
unassuming simplicity. I loved Guts not because it 
wowed me with intimidating scale, but because it 
innocently drew me in, deep into its emotional core, 
until I was too invested to let go.
