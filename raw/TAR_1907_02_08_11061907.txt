FOOTBALL & TRACK PRACTICE.
The ’varsity met with a decisive de­
feat at the hands of the Mt. Union 
College team at Alliance, Ohio, last 
Saturday, in a game that was char­
acterized throughout by the loose play 
of the Tech men. The gridiron was in 
wretched condition as a result of the 
heavy rain-fall, and forward passes 
or trick plays were impossible. Line 
bucks were the order of the day, and 
the Tartan defense made up of a large 
number of scrubs was entirely unable 
to stop the onslaughts of the Mt. 
Unioners. Frequent fumbles and an 
inability on the part of our men to 
get together at critical moments, to­
gether with the consistent play of the 
opponents were responsible for Tech’s 
defeat. Hatch, Patterson and Moore 
played well for Carnegie; and the Mt. 
Union back field did good work.
The Game.
Dr. Simpson flipped the coin at C 
o’clock, Capt. Henderson winning the 
toss choosing the wind and defending 
the east goal. Capt. Johns kicked off 
to Tech’s five yard line and receive ! 
by Frampton who ran it back to his 
own 20 yard line. Urling tried left 
end and made three yards. Urling 
tried for an on-sidc kick but it was 
blocked and Siegrist ran for Me. 
Union’s first touchdown. Score Mi. 
Union 6, Tech 0.
Brown kicked off to Mt. Union’s 20 
yard line. Cathorne advancing the
ball to his own 40 yard line. A 
Tech man had been declared off side 
but Mt. Union refused the penalty. Mt. 
Union began a series of line bucks that 
netted them first down twice. Then 
by end runs and shave tackle plays 
they made seven more yards and were 
forced to kick. Johns kicked to Tech’s
5 yard line, received by Dowling who 
fumbled and then recovered. Tech 
tried line plays but was unable to 
make the distance. Ball was passed 
back to Frampton who fumbled. Mt. 
Union’s ball. Johns was sent over for 
Mt. Union’s second touchdown. Score 
Mt. Union 11, Tech 0.
Brown kicked off to opponent’s 20- 
yard line and Gregory returned 10 
yards. Line bucks failed to net Mt. 
Union their distance and they were 
forced to kick. Hitner received punt 
on our 40 yard line. Dowling made 
1 yard. Time called.
Second Half.
Brown kicked to Mt. Union’s 20- 
yard line, returned by Main to his 
own 35-yard line. Opponents tried 
forward pass but Scotty blocked. 
Tech made distance three times and 
Patterson fumbled. Mt. Union fell 
on the ball. Mt. Union tried forward 
pass and made 8 yards. Garvin made 
two yards on right end. Line bucks 
made distance once. more. Tech held

College Athletics.
A writer in the Outlook” for Oc­
tober 5th, in discussing the college 
sports of to-day, deplores the present 
conditions and has some valuable sug
gestions as a remedy to the present 
evil.
We print exerpts from his article as 
follows:
The true object of organized ath­
letics at any given institution of learn­
ing is to promote the physical welfare 
of the undergraduates, to encourage 
them to participate in stimulating 
games, and to derive from these
games the benefits of fresh air, ex­
ercise, and that training of mind and 
body that only organized athletics can 
give. The term organized athletics is 
used to distinguish games in which 
team play is introduced, from such 
sports as shooting, riding, etc.
Furthermore, a comprehensive system 
should be designed to develop the 
bodies of the weak as well as those 
of the strong, and instill in all a habit 
of and love for out-of-door exercise. 
Exactly how far these objects are real­
ized can be best determined by an ex­
amination of the condition of athletics 
at the various colleges and universi­
ties of the country.
As conditions exist today, participa­
tion in sports, far from being general, 
is restricted to a small body of care­
fully selected and trained athletes, 
upon whom the entire effort and in­
terest of the institution is lavished. 
These men represent the active 
athletic .class a-, distinguished from 
the student or social classes, and on 
them devolves the task of represent­
ing their Alma Mater in games with 
rival institutions. The other members 
of the college or university are quite 
content to sit cn the side lines or in 
the grand stands and cheer these rep­
resentatives to that desired end, vic­
tory, to idolize them if they win and 
generally to execrate them if they 
lose.
The football system in vogue in 
American universities today has be­
come a process of elimination by 
which the best-endowed athletes are 
selected, to be developed into a highly 
trained organization, with the ulti­
mate object of defeating a similar or­
ganization from a rival university.
The American boy is as much im­
bued with the desire to win and make 
good as is the American man; both 
are vigorous and both are unquestion­
ably virile. Furthermore, concentra­
tion of effort has thousands of ex­
amples in this country, and it is only 
natural, when victory is the desidera­
tum, that the American bDys should 
adopt the methods that have made 
their fathers the most successful men 
in the world.
We lack a sane and normal point 
of view, and it is now necessary for 
the educators of the country not only 
to protest against present conditions, 
but to adopt new systems which will 
lessen the rivalry in intercollegiate 
athletics and genealize the interest.
To begin with, no university teams 
or crews should be formed until at 
most a month before the end of the 
seasons. Until that time the playing 
should be entirely restricted to inter­
class or inter-club teams as the sys­
tem adopted.
Such a change, though perhaps not 
entirely obviating the present difficul­
ties, would reduce them to a point 
where they would become practically

hai-mless. More men would imme­
diately be induced to participate, the 
present abnormal expenses would be 
tremendously lessened, and the over­
wrought state of excitement that now 
unavoidably accompanies an athletic 
campaign would disappear.
Suppose, for instance, that any two 
or three universities agreed to adopt 
such a plan in all their sports. Their 
external relations would be but little 
affected, tnough their internal con­
ditions would be vastly improved. Of 
course it is evident that one universi­
ty could not adopt such a plan and 
hope to compete on an equal footing 
with her rival who clung to present 
methods. A change, to be effective, 
would have to enlist a number of in­
stitutions.
The hiost important advantages to 
be gained would be the supplying to 
every undergraduate, first, an oppor­
tunity to play on a team composed of 
at least one or two men of exceptional 
ability; second, the incentive, now 
denied, of open competition for a 
place on the university team. The 
coaches who had previously devoted 
their entire energy to the few likely 
candidates would now direct that same 
energy to the club or class team with 
which they were particularly affiliated. 
In the case of a dormitory or club sys­
tem being adopted, the rivalry would 
increase as each new unit entered the 
field; all would be working to excel 
and at the same time general partici 
pation would raise the standard of 
play. The undergraduate who former­
ly felt that his duty was to sit in the 
grand stand and cheer the university 
team would be struggling for a posi­
tion on his club team, and, quite un­
consciously perhaps, doing his uni­
versity vastly more good than when 
his efforts were purely vocal. Other 
advantages along these lines are quite 
easy to elaborate, and will naturally 
occur to any one at all aware of pres­
ent athletic evils; it is sufficient for 
our purposes to enumerate only those 
of most vital importance.
Broadly speaking, the suggestion is 
as follows: The seasons of the various 
sports should be divided into two 
parts; the first, intra-university, and 
the second, inter-university. In the 
first a system cf sectional division 
should be established, varying to meet 
the pecul'ar conditions of the institu­
tion, having as its object the populari­
zation of the various forms of activity. 
Every effort to centralized energy on 
the varsity team or crew should be 
prohibited, and every effort to draw 
out and interest the weaker in body 
should be encouraged. At the close 
of this first part a series of sectional 
contests should be held as trials, on 
the basis of which the candidates for 
the university team could be chosen. 
The latter part of the season should 
be devoted towards developing a 
strong university team to meet the 
best teams of, at most, three or four 
rival institutions 
In order to accomplish this end the 
colleges and universities of the coun­
try would have to league themselves, 
probably, as they are leagued now in 
reference to their geographical posi­
tions—the Far West or Pacific slope, 
the Middle West, and the East; and 
naturally only those adopting this sys­
tem could meet.
The scope of this article has not 
been wide enough to allow a discus­
sion of the evils of professional or 
remunerated amateurs—the latter is 
perhaps in many cases a more accur­
ate term. They are simply the out­
growth of an exaggerated spirit of 
competition, and should disappear 
when this spirit is reduced to a 
normal condition.
Athletics must be regarded as edu­
cational, of mental as well as physical 
value. It should form quite as valu­
able an asset to any given institution 
as the more purely academical pur- i 
suits. Granted this, it is for those 
directly in charge of the colleges and 
universities of this country to/See that 
the true aim of athletics is not distort­
ed and its great power for good not 
restricted.

Miss Mabel Corbould, ’09,
Editor-in-Chief 
Miss Frances Looney, ’09,
Business Manager
During the past week we have had 
two very interesting and distinguish­
ed visitors. The first, Miss Jane 
Addams, founder of Hull House, Chi­
cago; one of the most philanthropic 
women of today. She delivered a very 
interesting address upon a- subject 
very near to us all: “The problem be­
tween Trade Teaching and Home 
Teaching.” Miss Addams is an inde­
fatigable slum worker, and is interest­
ed in all human questions.
“Just at present,” she said, “there 
is a very interesting problem for wo­
men to solve, and perhaps this school 
will lead to its solution.
“Young women go out as wage 
earners, and do not learn anything of 
the care of the home, which is the 
correct sphere for woman. Before 
machinery was invented much was 
done by hand; but now that the fac­
tories have taken this employment 
from them the question is, ‘How are 
they to bridge over from this to 
domestic life?’”
It is very interesting to think that 
the graduates of the M. M. C. S. may 
be the very women to solve the prob­
lem.
Our other visitor was Mrs. Shaw, 
who was playing in “Mrs. Warren’s 
Profession” at the Duquesne last 
week.
Her talk on the qualities of the 
human voice was enjoyed by us all, 
for her own voice was a pleasure to 
listen to. She pointed out how very 
important it is for everyone to watch 
the pitch of the voice, and the way in 
which the English language is pro­
nounced, so that every word be given 
its true value. The first impressions 
we give to those whom we meet is 
our mode of using the voice, this is 
very essential to the success of one 
who is looking for a position, or in 
the choice of some one to fill a posi­
tion. Pronunciation shows honesty, 
as it shows a right spirit to the value 
of words.

Phantom Party.
The Phantom Party,” which was 
given by the class of 1910 to the 
Faculty and Juniors was a grand suc­
cess. First on the program was a 
phantom march led by Elizabeth 
Kelly and Margaret Law. A bowing 
contest was a very amusing feature of 
the afternoon and Miss Schwartz car­
ried off the prize. The following 
toast was given, just before refresh­
ments were served.

The music was splendid and every 
one looked quite ghostly as she danc­

very festive appearance to the gym.

A Thanksgiving Celebration.
It has been suggested that the stu­
dents hold a celebration on Thanks­
giving evening as a fitting close to 
the foot-ball season. The most prob­
able form that this celebration is 
likely to take is that of a Tech night 
at some one of the theaters, most 
probably the Nixon. It will be re­
membered by the members of the 
Senior and Junior classes that such 
an evening was spent last year on 
the occasion of the Kiski game, and 
that all present had a good time, with 
the possible exception of those 'ho 
had a free ride in the city hack.
A mass meeting will be held to 
discuss the idea and to pass on some 
other important matters in the near 
future, and every true Tech supporter 
should be present.
The Tartan suggests that the Tech 
Glee Club sit together at the Lehigh 
game and lead in the school songs.
It will be well for the athletic as­
sociation to prepare a statement of 
our eligibility code in order that 
copies may be sent to our prospec­
tive opponents.
The Inter-Schools Relations Com­
mittee will distribute the funds dur­
ing this month. Representatives of 
the various organizations who desire 
a part of this fund should report at 
once to Chairman Prof. Crabtree.
The following committees have 
been chosen for the Thanksgiving 
foot-ball game:
Advertising — Sampson, Huntley, 
Thomson.
Entertainment — Mr. Field, Hunt, 
Steen.
The Senior dramatic committee was 
elected as follows: Merrill, Foster,
Sampson.
You may say what you please, but 
it pays better to say what pleases 
other people.
Even failure may be spoiled by 
success.
Technical Items.
It is reported that the White Star 
Line proposes to equip a passenger 
steamer on their Dominion Line with 
a combination of turbines and reci­
procating engines. This steamer is 
to be built by Harland & Wolff. This 
combination has been advocated by 
Mr. Parsons for some time in the case 
of vessels of moderate or slow speed, 
from the point of fuel economy. It is 
prcpcsed to use the turbines for the 
low-pressure expansion. A consider­
able gain in economy is expected with 
this arrangement, since the turbines 
are able to carry the expansion of 
steam economically to a degree far be­
yond that obtainable in the cylinder 
of the reciprocating engine. It will be 
necessary to provide for the use of 
condensers permitting a high vacuum. 
A gain of from 10 to 12 per cent is 
claimed in consequence. The proposal 
of Meessrs. Harland & Wolff is to use 
two sets of quadruple expansion en­
gines, each driving a screw propeller 
and placed in about the position they 
would occupy in a twin-screw steamer. 
Associated with them on a central 
shaft, a single turbine is to be used, 
driving a third propeller of a smaller 
diameter than the wing screws driven 
by reciprocating engines. This is only 
one of two or three arrangements 
which have been proposed, the prob­
lem being a more or less uncertain 
one as yet.

A contract has been let by the 
Southern Pacific Company for the 
building of a rifled oil pipe line 256 
miles long from oil properties in Kern 
County, in the southern part of Cali­
fornia, to tide water on San Francisco 
Bay. An interesting feature of the 
line is the character of the pipe used, 
its “rifled” construction being a 
radical departure from that of lines 
now generally in use for conveying oil. 
Spiral indentations accomplished in 
the rolling of the pipe constitute the 
rifling. An exhaustive series of ex­
periments has demonstrated that after 
a small per cent of water has been 
added to the oil, and the necessary 
pressure applied, that the whole will 
develop a whirling motion, and that 
the water being the heavier will seek 
the outside of the pipe, thereby en­
veloping the oil in a thin film or shell 
of water, this shell or film of water 
acting as a lubricant between the oil 
and the pipe, and thereby greatly re­
ducing the friction and allowing the 
core of oil to glide through the pipe 
readily. Throughout the length of 256 
miles of pipe there will be twenty- 
three pumping stations, the equipment 
of each station being in duplicate so 
that in the event of a breakage of any 
part of the machinery of one pump, 
the other may immediately be put into 
service. With the size of the pipe, 
which is 8 inches, and the high pres­
sure carried, and improved facilities in 
every way, a rapid transmission of 
the oil has been shown to be possible, 
and it is estimated that at least 23,000 
barrels of fuel oil can be delivered 
every twenty-four hours.

Purposes of the Proposed Engineer­
ing and Industry Laboratories.
Although it will be some time yet 
before any definite information can 
be secured regarding the permanent 
location of the government fuel test­
ing laboratories, it is the judgment 
of the men who have been endeavor­
ing to secure its establishment here, 
that Pittsburg has more than an even 
chance.
The purposes of the laboratories 
are for the carrying on of investiga­
tions that will lead to the prevention 
of accidents (and consequent loss of 
life and property) caused by inade­
quate knowledge as to the chemical 
and physical properties of the ma­
terials of construction, and their b3- 
taviour when assembled into built- 
up structural members.
(Examples: Quebec Bridge disaster, 
collapsed buildings, railway disasters, 
etc.)
Prevention of accidents (and conse­
quent loss of life and property) re­
sulting from the explosion of gas, coal 
dust, etc., and greater efficiencies in 
mining operations; through a better 
knowledge of materials and processes.
(Mine accidents are becoming more 
extensive and destructive with the 
deepening and extension of the mines. 
They now kill or injure in the United 
States 5,000 to 6,000 persons yearly.)
Prevention of fires (and consequent 
loss of life and property) through a 
better knowledge as to the methods 
of fire-proofing of materials and build­
ings.
(Property losses from fire in the 
United States now aggregate over 
$200,-000,000 «per annum, or nearly 
$2.50 per capita, as against $.30 per 
capita in the larger European coun­
tries.)
Prevention of waste in the utiliza­
tion of the nation’s fuels and other 
resources, through the discovery of 
some efficient processes and more 
economic methods of use and produc­
tion.
(The waste of our fuels will soon
become a serious national problem. 
Often 50% is lost in mining and haul­
ing. Of the coal delivered at the 
furnaces only about 5% of the heat 
units is now converted into actual 
work. The exhaustion of mineral re­
sources is a permanent exhaustion, 
as they are not reproduced. Pitts­
burg and the nation deserve a great 
future as well as a great past.)
The carrying on of such funda­
mental investigations of materials 
and processes as may be a basis for 
new industrial developments.
The proper plans for such laborator­
ies, commensurate with the magni­
tude of the interests involved and the 
enormous development of the coun­
try, will require a ground area of 12 
to 15 acres, with buildings and perma­
nent equipment costing approximately 
$3,000,000 The laboratories will have 
an immediate income of $500,000 per 
annum and should have, when well 
organized, an aggregate income of 
not less than $750,000 per annum 
(from U. S. government and from 
fees for special work).
These investigations will have an 
international as well as a nationai 
importance.

The Mechanical Department has 
lately received an eighty-inch slide 
ruie, donated by Kuvz, Langbein & 
Swartz, for use in illustrating the use 
of the slide rule. A number of the 
pneumatic tools have also been re­
ceived and are being used to drill the 
trench covers, thus saving the labor 
of carrying those heavy plates up to 
the machine shop.
A Case pedestal engine, manufac­
tured by the New Britain Machine 
Company, arrived last week. It is to 
be used for light high- speed service 
and runs normally at 2,000 revolu­
tions. It is of rather odd construc­
tion, and the peculiar features of the 
design are the piston and cylinder. 
The piston is fastened to the upper 
end of the piston rod and is single 
acting, while the cylinder oscillates 
in the upper part of the frame.
The cross-head and the connecting 
rod are thus eliminated and the 
weight of the reciprocating parts is 
reduced to a minimum. The cylinder 
is rocked in its casing by a sleeve 
outside the rod, and has large bearing 
areas so that the wear is slight. It 
is balanced on the down stroke by 
the reaction of the steam on the upper 
head, and on the up stroke by a thin 
film of steam admitted to a chamber 
in the bottom. The motion of the 
cylinder controls the admission while 
the cut-off is regulated by a shaft 
governor. The whole engine is nicely 
polished and painted a glossy gray 
color.
New Machine Tools.
Last week the machine shop had 
some additions to the machinery. A 
small universal grinder made by the 
Cincinnati Milling Machine Company 
and intended for tool room use, to­
gether with all its attachments for 
external and internal grinding, ar­
rived in the first part of the week.
On Friday a large Radial drill, made
by the Bickford Drill & Tool C m- 
pany, also of Cincinnati, having an 
individual motor drive through the 
famous speed box of that company, 
was received and will be set up and 
working in a short time.
Comments on the Team.
The weather aided Mt. Union last 
Saturday beyond a doubt and it is 
rumored that the Massillion Tigers 
helped some; but reports indicate 
that Tech’s playing might have been 
better. That is putting it mildly for 
those who saw the game agree that 
with two or three exceptions, the 
boys did from “only fair” to “abso­
lutely rotten.” It is not our intention 
to knock the team, because we know 
that it is a good one. It can, and 
has, put up a first class article of foot­
ball, but every member of the squad 
should realize that it is necessary to 
play hard in every game. When 
Tech realizes that hard play is need­
ed, it can make any team in this sec­
tion go some to beat it.
The men are sore; very sore, over 
the result of Saturday’s game; and if 
they ever played football in their 
lives, they will do it when they stack 
up against W. & J. on the ninth. We 
do not often prophecy; but something 
is due to happen in Little Washington 
next Saturday. If W. & J. wins, it 
will be after playing gilt edged ball 
all the time.
By the use of a unique and original 
method in the building of the forge 
fires, Mr. Anslow, instructor in foun­
dry practice, is making the coke used 
in that department at a saving of 25% 
on the fuel bill. The process consists 
in packing the dampened slack coal 
around a block which is inserted in 
the tuyere. After it has been packed 
solid the block is withdrawn, leaving 
a mould of its shape. This style fire 
permits of the heating tools right on 
the point in tool dressing, which is 
difficult on the old style fire.

An effort was made last Wednesday 
evening to try the mettle of the class 
of 1912. What followed was not 
what might be called a class rush, as 
1912 was recruited at full strength, 
while 1911 was represented by but a 
dozen of her most prominent rough 
house experts. Notwithstanding the 
strict orders of 'proud and doting 
mammas to come straight home (or 
home straight), the youthful “cutups” 
decided to hold another meeting. In 
view of the fact that their first meet­
ing was adjourned amid great con­
fusion, they resolved to tempt fate 
again in order to organize and elect 
officers.
The class of 1911, represented by 
twelve of her number, decided to be­
stow a little attention upon the “kin­
dergarten,” and the upshot of the 
whole affair was a little fracas last­
ing about an hour. Whether the 
meeting was a success or not has not 
been ascertained, but the disturbing 
element (1911) were finally, but at 
a great sacrifice of clothes, hair and 
gore ejected from the lecture room.
Perhaps the only feature of the 
affair was the introduction of the 
fire hose into the argument. The 
young scamps of twelve thought they
would play a trump card with this 
instrument, but they were immedi­
ately dispossessed of same and it was 
put out of commission by one of the 
clever ’11 contingent, who “green ap- 
pled” it (i. e., tied it into a knot) and 
thus prevented the water from flow­
ing.
It seems that the youngsters devel­
oped a great deai of nerve when they 
discovered that they had but a hand­
ful of opponents, and loud and fre­
quent were the threats as the rival 
classes marched homeward.
Good feeling was restored between 
the rivals and in proof the complete 
burial of the hatchet. All who were 
not in a great hurry adjourned to the 
soda dispensary and there a little im­
promptu fraternization took place. 
To 1912 belongs the honor of making 
the first advance in the way of peace, 
as one of her number treated the 
crowd of about twenty-five to “the 
best the house affords.” 1911 re­
sponded by sending around the cigars. 
After a few short toasts of varying 
degrees of elegance, 1912 crowned her 
already glorious record by proposing 
the following toast, which was greet­
ed with a locomotive yell:
“Here’s to 1911 for four years.
Here’s to 1912 for five years,
But here’s to Tech forever.”
Mr. Hower (to B-2)—I suppose 
you gentlemen are all familiar with 
the “dyne.”
Geyer—We are more familiar with 
the verb than with noun.
Mr. Howard—I have not heard the 
gong and it is now 8.25.
Wilharm—It’s on a strike.
Mr. Howard—I think not, as I have 
not yet heard it.
A committee has been appointed 
which will be in charge of the social 
affairs held by the class of 1911. A 
smoker will perhaps be the first of a 
series of functions given by them. 
All the affairs will be advertised and 
all necessary information will be 
given out at the discretion of the 
committee and not at the suggestion 
ox any outside classes.
The constitution provides that the 
secretary of the class shall be chair­
man of the social committee. Mr. C. 
B. Cline will therefore be in charge 
and he will be assisted by the 
Messrs. Hess, Johnson, Locke and 
iviiller.
Harry McCulley has been appointed 
chairman of the Athletic Committee 
and will shortly issue a challenge to
1910 and ’12 for a foot-ball game with 
each. Mr. McCulley will choose his 
fellow committeemen and it will not 
be long before things are going on in 
an athletic way in 1911. Foot-ball 
players are being looked up and those 
with experience kindly report to ivic- 
Culley or Stamm.
With characteristic innocence one 
of the ’12 boys exclaimed when he 
saw the 1911 faces after the _ recent 
battle: “Did you few fellows make all 
that fuss? I thought there were a 
hundred.”
On next Wednesday evening, Nov. 
6, a class meeting of the class of 1911 
will be held. Routine business will 
be reduced to minimum and all the 
time remaining will be devoted to 
cheering practice, in anticipation of 
the Lehigh-Tech game on Thanksgiv­
ing. As we are all loyal to our grid­
iron heroes, let us show it by coming 
out and making ourselves heard. The 
only way to do this effectively is to 
get together to practice and also to 
learn new yells. A cheer leader from
1911 is to be elected and all 1911 men 
will be in one group at the game, so 
a large delegation is required in or­
der to make a creditable showing. 
Come out, all!

THE TARTAN13
The Electric Control of Power Ma­
chinery.
Apart from the general conven­
ience of electric power, and the op­
portunities which it affords in the 
placing of machinery in the most ad­
vantageous positions for efficient oper­
ation, one of the most important 
changes which its introduction has 
wrought lies in the convenience of 
control which it permits. The ma 
chine designer had formerly to con­
sider most carefully the placing of the 
various levers, hand-wheels and other 
appliances by which the operator 
controlled the apparatus. Handles 
had to be brought out at points con­
venient to the position of the work­
man; exposure to heat or to moving 
portions of the machine had to be 
considered, and sometimes the com­
mercial success of a machine depend 
ed very largely upon the care which 
had been given to those elements in­
volved in the convenience of control. 
With the introduction of electric 
power, however, it became possible 
so to arrange the working parts of an 
installation that they could perform 
their work to the best mechanical 
advantage, since the question of con­
trol was a matter which could be set­
tled afterwards, and which was prac­
tically independent of the position of 
the working parts.
An example of this independence 
of control is seen in a comparison 
between an electric car and a loco­
motive engine. In the latter ma­
chine it is necessary to provide a 
strong reversing lever, connected to 
the link motion by a heavy bar. To 
this must be addeu the valve lever, 
this being brought over to the side of 
the cab, so that both handles may be 
close to the point where the engineer 
stands. In like manner, mechanical 
connections for all the functions of 
the machine are gathered about the 
same operative point, as the outcome 
of experience in the design of a ma­
chine which is the product of the 
thought of many designers. With the 
electric car all these mechanical con­
necting appliances are omitted. The 
motors are placed where they can 
best be connected to the wheels, the 
wiring is brought to the platform or 
cabin for the motorman, and all the 
functions of control are included in a
single, separate piece of apparatus, 
which, with its single handle, enables 
the operator to manage all the move­
ments of the vehicle. In like man­
ner the operations of an electric trav­
eling crane%are managed by a con­
troller which enables all the varied 
functions to be determined from the 
operator's cage, and all electrical ma­
chinery may be similarly controlled.
But the facility of electrical con­
trol extends much further. Practi­
cally every kind of machine in which 
the operations are directed by me­
chanical connections may have those 
movements effected by electric mo­
tors, and since these can be man­
aged in turn by electric controllers, 
the field for such apparatus is practi­
cally unlimited. Printing presses, 
elevators; pumps, air compressors, 
cranes, hoists, machine tools of all 
kinds, for these the modern system 
of electric control appears as the one 
effective method of handling and di­
rection.
Under the modern method of dif­
ferentiation of industrial operations 
the separation of the control from the 
machine and its embodiment in an 
independent device has naturally led 
to the specialization of the manufac­
ture of such apparatus. Thus, the 
larger and heavier pieces of electrical 
machinery, dynamos, motors, trans­
formers, converters, etc., are manu­
factured by establishments which pre­
fer to leave the production of switch­
boards, starters, regulators, controll­
ers and similar appliances to firms 
which, by devoting their entire at­
tention to this department of work, 
may bring these devices to a degree 
of perfection not otherwise attainable, 
and at the same time develop meth- | 
ods of manufacture which bring the ! 
costs within the necessary commercial 
limits.—Cassier’s Magazine.

His wife had used all her powers of j 
persuasion without avail, and at last 
resorted to the final feminine expedient 
—a flood of tears. At this the professor 
of chemistry picked up his hat but paus­
ed to remark:
“You might save yourself the trouble 
of that, my dear; your tears have ab­
solutely no effect upon me. Why should 
they, being nothing but common water 
with a very small percentage of phos­
phorus salts and a trace of chloride of 
sodium?”

REVIEWS.
Diamond Digging in the Vaal River.
A South African mining company 
has recently equipped a barge on the 
Vaal river with a complete driving 
outfit for half a dozen drivers, and 
has engaged in the work of seeking 
diamonds in he river bed. The 
barge is moored at a point about 3% 
miles below Klerltsdorp. A wire 
rope is stretched across the river from 
the Transvaal to the Orange River 
Colony side, to enable the barge to 
be kept in position in mid-stream, and 
from this the divers descend and work 
in from 48 feet to 52 feet of water. 
At present the divers have no light to 
enable them to see and are working 
for three or four hours at a stretch in 
icy cold water and intense darkness. 
All they are able t do at present is 
to grope around, move the big boul­
ders with the crowbar, and scrape up 
the smaller stuff from the bed of the 
river, emptying it into a large iron- 
bound wire drum which takes about 
half an hour to fill. When full this 
is hoisted on to the barge, dumped 
into tubs and roughly sorted to throw 
away large stones and to retain the 
gravel and pebbles, among which the 
diamonds are found. The deposit is 
far too heavy to gravitate and is 
sorted wholly after having been 
roughly screened through coarse 
sieves. The returns for the first 
month’s operations are reported to 
be satisfactory and arrangements are 
being taken to secure an electric 
lighting plant which will simplify the 
miners’ work and increase their effi­
ciency.------o-------
Noble George.
The greatest panic in recent years 
is now affecting the Huntingdon 
stock exchange. The money situation 
is especially tight. Deacon Snodgrass 
pawned his newest pair of shoestrings 
to buy himself a box of matches. The 
whole countryside are afraid of t^eir 
food supply this winter. Geo. H. 
Westbrook, President of the Geo. H. 
Westbi’ook Lumber, Shoe, Calico and 
Shoestring Co., who is at present in 
Pittsburg, is the greatest loser. He 
has been speculating and recently 
won 35^ on a football game. He 
generously telegraphed and gave the
mayor his permission to draw on him 
for any amount up to 29^, provided 
the mayor would give the town as 
security. Thus the market is resting 
easy and everything :'s O. K.
All Aboard for Washington.
It is probable that a large crowd 
will go to Washington to see the 
game. The cost is not great, the fare 
being but $±.25. The relations be­
tween W. & J. and Tech are of the 
best. Last year, the team made a hit 
at Washington by their nerve and 
their gameness in the face of over­
whelming odds. This year the men 
will be just as game and much better 
trained.
Those who make the trip will see 
a first class game and will meet a fine 
bunch of fellows:
The team is working hard this 
week in preparation for the game with 
W. & J. It needs scrimmage work 
badly and everybody who can pos­
sibly spare the time and can play at 
all should come out and help the boys 
get in shape.
Mass Meeting.
The mass meeting called for last 
Thursday had to be called off, as there 
were only about 20 men present. An 
attempt will be made to hold a mass 
meeting this week. Everybody should 
come. The committee appointed to 
look into the constitution of the 
Athletic Association is anxious to 
make its report.
It is necessary that something be 
done in regard to the athletic situa­
tion. The Athletic Association at 
present consists of the delegates 
elected last year and none of the 
entering classes has the representa­
tion it is entitled to. To help get 
things settled and athletics put on a 
firm basis, take a few minutes time 
and come to the mass meeting called 
by Mr. Colmery.
“Do you intend to give your son a 
college education?”
“No, what’s the use wasting 
money? He never sticks at anything. 
Why I’d bet he wouldn’t be on the 
football team two weeks before he’d 
be tired of it, and want them to put a 
substitute in his place.”

Some New Models.
The strength of materials labor­
atory presents a very busy appear­
ance these days. Prof. Thayer is 
having constructed a miniature plate 
girder which is exactly like a large 
one in appearance and as to detail. 
It is about ten feet in length and is 
supported at both ends by model con­
crete abutments. The pieces have 
nearly all been cut to size and all 
that remains is to rivet the parts to­
gether.
The bins on the right hanjl side of 
the room are for cement of various 
kinds and also to contain the testing 
apparatus. It is hoped that the labor­
atory will be completely equipped by 
the end of the term, and that every­
thing will be in working order by 
that time.
Crucible Club Meeting.
At the Crucible Club’s first regular 
meeting of the year, held at the Wood- 
lawn Cottage last Saturday evening, 
Ignacio Sivitz was elected to the 
Presidency, and “John D. Rockefel­
ler” Rieger was elected to the Sec­
retary’s post. A heated discussion 
took place over the advisability of 
electing all of the present Junior 
Chemical and Metallurgical sections 
to the club, and they finally decided to 
take every man of those sections who 
signified a desire to become a mem­
ber. A constitution committee was 
appointed, composed of W. Hamnett 
and Koethen, with Mr. McIntosh as 
.faculty adviser. Mr. Esquerre was 
elected to membership. A delightful 
luncheon was served, after which the 
nen left for their homes.

The coming exhibition of the Pitts­
burg Architectural Club in the art 
galleries recently dedicated in the 
Carnegie Institute is to be the largest 
and in importance the most far-reach­
ing exhibition of international char­
acter ever held in this country. Ex­
hibits are expected from all the lead­
ing architects from England, Scot­
land, France, Germany, and Austria. 
The exhibition will open November 9, 
and closes December 1, 1907. Car­
negie Tech, Massachusetts Tech, 
Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, 
and the American Society of Beaux 
Arts are among the other institutions 
represented.

TECH. STADIUM.
With the object in view of secur­
ing for Pittsburg an athletic stadium 
that will rival other great fields of 
its kind in America the civil engineer­
ing class is surveying land in the 
rear of the school building.
For some time talk of the proposed 
stadium has been heard. Tech’s un­
fortunate lack of a suitable field for 
the various branches of athletics, in 
which they are fast taking a place in 
the front ranks in the Pittsburg dis­
trict, first brought up the project. At 
present Tech’s athletics are confined 
to a small field on the top of a hill 
south of the school buildings, swept 
by every wind and gale that rises, 
and formed of small stones and 
gravel, all of which are detrimental 
to athletic practice or competition in 
foot-ball, base-ball or track.
Southeast of the buildings, be­
tween Forbes street and the Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie School for 
Women, is a natural stadium. A por­
tion of the hollow, several hundred 
feet long and probably 200 feet wide, 
forms an ideal spot for the erection 
of an athletic field. Up the sides of 
the hills will be built many tiers of 
seats, giving Tech. a stadium that 
will compare favorably with the fa­
mous fields at Harvard, Syracuse and 
Leland Stanford University in Cali­
fornia.
Director Hamerschlag, in speaking 
of the proposed stadium, said: “The 
civil engineering class has been con­
ducting surveys in the hollow back 
of the buildings, with a view toward 
ascertaining whether there is suffi­
cient space for the erection of a stad­
ium. Whether base-ball and foot ball 
fields, together with the necessary 
track and fields for other minor 
sports, can be accommodated in the 
valley until the class completing the 
work makes a report nothing can be 
done in the matter.
“If the stadium is erected Tech. 
will be supplied with something they 
have been sadly in need of for the 
past two seasons. It is not expected 
that the cost of erection will mount 
up to any high figures, as nature has 
supplied ideal conditions for a stad­
ium.
Stolen kisses may be great, but 
they do not compare with those that 
might have been stolen.
