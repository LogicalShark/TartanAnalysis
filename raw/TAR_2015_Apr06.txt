Smoking policy review committee seeks to cut cigarettes from campus
BRIAN WALSH
Staffwriter
Cigarettes: many students have had 
one, some want to try them, and some 
smoke them as a habit.
Currently, Carnegie Mellon allows 
students and other campus members 
to smoke in designated smoking ar-
eas, often situated in less traveled ar-
eas and on the peripheries of campus. 
But that could change if a tobacco free 
policy proposed by the Smoking Policy 
Review Committee is approved by an 
Undergraduate Student Senate vote 
on Thursday. The policy also must be 
approved by the Graduate Student As-
sembly, Staff Council, Faculty Senate, 
and University President Subra Suresh 
before it goes into effect.
The committee, composed mainly 
of administrators and other employ-
ees of the university, will completely 
remove smoking from campus if their 
policy is approved.
The committee has sought to elimi-
nate designated smoking zones since 
its inception in 2013. The committee 
was formed by Dr. Anita Barkin, the 
former director of health services, who 
found that the current policy allowing 
designated smoking zones is outdated.
In 2009, a group called The Healthy 
Campus Task Force created the desig-
nated areas and enforced a $25 ?ne for 
smoking in non-designated areas as 
part of a program Campus 2010. The 
?nes also pertained to littering ciga-
rette butts.
“The committee was formed to 
benchmark best practices, to look at 
other colleges’ policies, and to review 
the literature to understand from a 
public health standpoint what was in 
the university’s best interests,” Dean of 
Student Affairs Gina Casalegno said.
The argument can be made that 
Carnegie Mellon is behind in its to-
bacco policy. 1,514 campuses around 
the country do not allow smoking, and 
1,014 are completely free of tobacco as 
of January this year, according to the 
United States Tobacco Free Initiative.
There were about 774 smoke-free 
campuses and 562 tobacco-free cam-
pus when the Smoking Policy Review 
Committee was created, according to 
the initiative.
It was not always the case that 
Carnegie Mellon found itself behind 
in this policy. Junior decision science 
major Julia Eddy, a member of Stu-
dent Senate, sits on the committee 
as the only undergraduate student 
representative.
“Early on, our policy of having 
smoking areas in 2006 was very 
Study on sexual assault released

When Jess Klein arrived at 
Carnegie Mellon University 
in 2013, the school was still 
reeling over the Beta Theta Pi 
scandal.
As the ?rst-ever coordi-
nator of gender programs 
and sexual violence preven-
tion, Klein was in charge of 
re-imagining the university’s 
programs, public perception, 
and results — no small task. 
But Klein, in her one-and-a-
half-year tenure, has worked 
to change the campus culture 
surrounding sexual assault 
and relationship violence 
prevention (SARVP), includ-
ing revamping the survivor 
support network (SSN) and 
helping to pilot the univer-
sity’s ?rst-ever SARV student 
study.
The survey, made avail-
able on April 5 to students at 
the Pittsburgh campus, will 
be open until April 27, ac-
cording to Ashley Sobhani, 
a junior global studies ma-
jor who sits on the SARVP 
committee and is an active 
member of the SSN and Got 
Consent?.
“This survey was going to 
be released next fall, but we 
decided that if we could do it 
now, we should,” Klein said. 
“We know this is important, 
and we’ve got to do it right.”
Designed by Janel A. Sut-
kus, the director of institu-
tional research and analysis 
at Carnegie Mellon, the sur-
vey is individualized: Every 
time a student answers a 
question, their answer will 
determine the next question.
“We need this survey on 
campus, because we realized 
that there was a very small 
group ... that had experience 
with [SARV prevention],” 
Sobhani said. “The bubble 
was too small and not repre-
sentative of our campus.”
Sobhani said that, through 
the survey, they will be able 
to target people who have a 
part in perpetuating SARV is-
sues on campus.
We’ll be able to know and 
understand their part in it, 
make them aware of it, and 
how they can help to change 
if need be, especially through 
bystanders,” Sobhani said.
The study is the result 
of a collaboration between 
Klein, Director of Upperclass 
and Greek Student Life Lucas 
Christian, Assistant Dean of 
Student Affairs Holly Hip-
pensteel, Dean of Student 
Affairs Gina Casalengo, Asso-
ciate Dean of Student Affairs 
John Hannon, and Assistant 
Vice President of General 
Counsel Dan Munsch, ac-
cording to Klein.

ily on the SSN to both spread 
awareness of the survey

CUC shell space bought by Senate 
RACHEL COHEN
Contributing Editor
Most students know that 
the construction to the Jared 
L. Cohon University Center 
(CUC) will erect new ?tness 
and performance spaces for 
student and community use. 
Those designs are ?rmly 
planned and have been the 
discussion of the expansion 
for months, if not years.
But on the third ?oor of 
the expansion, there is space 
for student use whose speci?c 
design is still in ?ux — “shell 
space,” as administrators and 
students alike have termed it.
The name “shell space” 
comes from the current build-
ing plan for the space: a ?oor, 
four walls, and a ceiling, with 
no de?nitive current plans 
for further furnishing — in 
essence, an empty shell.
Since its initial conception 
and purchase by Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno 
and Vice President of Cam-
pus Affairs Michael Murphy, 
planning for the space has 
passed primarily to student 
government, and discussions 
are well underway.
Conception
According to Director 
of Student Activities Liz 
Vaughan, the shell space 
wasn’t part of the original 
plan for the CUC expansion.
Rather, it became “ef-
fectively an add-on to the 
project” once administrators 
realized they could seize an 
opportunity amid the previ-
ously planned disruption to 
the building.
Vaughan said that it’s 
easier to erect extra space 
while construction is already 
altering the landscape than 
to add onto existing spaces 
later, even if those spaces 
are not immediately needed. 
Furthermore, she explained, 
“It would be cost prohibitive 
to ever do that in the future.”
So the initial rationale 
behind shell space was pro-
active, anticipating future 
needs, rather than reactive to 
current demands.
The creation of additional 
space was made logistically 
feasible when it became pos-
sible to dig deeper than origi-
nally planned in shaping out 
the lower levels of the CUC 
expansion. Those new spac-
es, in turn, allowed for extra 
capacity on the third ?oor.
According to Vaughan, 
the driving question was 
“How do we take advantage 
of the construction and maxi-
mize the space that could be 
captured?”
These lower spaces have 
already essentially been auc-
tioned off. The two biggest 
purchasers have been Carn-
egie Mellon Dining and the 
Carnegie Mellon Bookstore 
— “neither of [whom] have 
nearly the storage space they 
need” currently, Vaughan 
said — both of whom will 
be ?nancially responsible for 
furnishing that space.
While dining and the 
bookstore ?lled out the lower 
levels, it became clear that 
the extra room on the third 
?oor could be harnessed as 
student space, with fewer 
passersby on the upper levels 
and student organization of-
?ce space also in use nearby.
Seeing the potential, Casa-
legno and Murphy found the 
funds — most of which came 
from a large past donation to 
the school — to purchase the 
space and approach student 
government with a proposal.
In essence, the third ?oor 
was not opened for bidding 
as were the designated din-
ing and bookstore spaces on 
the lower levels, but ?rst of-
fered for purchase by Senate

By the time students re-
turn from their summer vaca-
tion, the Dietrich Colleges of 
Humanities and Social Sci-
ences will have a new addi-
tion: the Institute for Politics 
and Strategy (IPS).
The IPS, which opens on 
July 1, will seek to further po-
litical science, international 
relations, national security 
policy, and grand strategy 
at the university through re-
search, education, and initia-
tives across Carnegie Mellon 
University.
The IPS will be led by Di-
rector of the Center for In-
ternational Relations and 
Politics Kiron K. Skinner, who 
also serves as the university’s 
advisor on national security 
policy.
Upon opening, the IPS 
will offer undergraduate stu-
dents a bachelor of science 
in international relations 
and politics, as well as two 
minors: one in international 
relations and politics and one 
in politics and public policy. 
The IPS will also offer the 
college’s Washington Semes-
ter Program.
For graduates, the IPS will 
administer the humanities 
part of the master’s of infor-
mation technology strategy 
program.
“The IPS will be a focal 
point for research on poli-
tics, particularly politics in 
the international arena,” Di-
etrich College Dean Richard 
Scheines said in a university 
news release. “Along with 
several important scholars 
from the Pittsburgh of?ce 
of the RAND Corporation as 
well as political science de-
partments at several top uni-
versities, the work of the IPS 
will add a critical dimension 
to Dietrich’s portfolio in hu-
manities and social sciences.”
In addition to its major 
and minor offerings, the IPS 
will house the Center for In-
ternational Relations and 
Politics and the humanities 
part of the Institute for Stra-
tegic Analysis (ISA). 
The ISA, with portions in 
the College of Engineering 
and School of Computer Sci-
ence, aims to provide campus 
members with “high-level, 
strategic engagements with 
the defense, diplomatic and 
intelligence communities 
through activities spanning 
disciplines of several colleges 
at the university,” according 
to the news release. 
Skinner is the director of 
both of these programs.

Students receive Goldwater scholarships to pursue science, math, or engineering
Junior biological sciences 
major Jillian Jaycox and ju-
nior materials science and 
engineering and chemistry 
double major Joshua Kubiak 
are recipients of Barry M. 
Goldwater Scholarships.
They are two of 260 soph-
omores and juniors chosen 
from 1,200 nominations for 
the 2015–16 academic year.
Goldwater Scholars re-
ceive up to $7,500 for one 
or two years to pay for items 
such as tuition, books, and 
room and board.
The scholarship was cre-
ated by the U.S. Congress in 
the name of Sen. Barry M. 
Goldwater and is awarded 
to allow students to study 
mathematics, the natural 
sciences, and engineering.
“Jaycox’s and Kubiak’s 
recognition as Goldwater 
Scholars demonstrate the 
embodiment of a CMU edu-
cation,” said Jennifer Keat-
ing-Miller, associate director 
of undergraduate research 
and national fellowships in 
a university press release. 
“They are fully deserving of 
their recognition as Gold-
water Scholars. It will be an 
exciting endeavor to see how 
their respective academic 
and personal paths will un-
fold in the coming years.”
Carnegie Mellon has had 
20 Goldwater Scholars, ac-
cording to the release.

150 killed in terrorist attack on Garissa University College in Kenya
On Wednesday, 10 former 
Atlanta Public School educa-
tors were charged with con-
spiracy and more in a cheat-
ing scandal that has been 
under investigation since 
2008. The teachers were part 
of a large, organized effort to 
improve test scores by taking 
tests home with them and 
changing the answers. The 
test scores had so markedly 
improved that it prompted 
speculation and then investi-
gation from the Georgia gov-
ernor’s of?ce. The 10 teach-
ers that were jailed last week 
are awaiting bail and have 
been sentenced to between 
?ve to 10 years and 20 years.
Last week, California Gover-
nor Jerry Brown announced 
that communities across the 
state are now responsible for 
cutting their water usage by 
25 percent over the next few 
months. The mandate went 
out to both urban and agri-
cultural areas to decrease wa-
ter usage and will be of?cially 
released in May. According to 
Brown, the state will have 
the right to ?ne agencies up 
to $10,000 per day if they do 
not obey the limited usage 
rules. These limitations will 
have a great impact on agri-
culture in the state in particu-
lar, leaving nearly 500,000 
acres of land unused.

On Thursday, gunmen from 
a Somalian terror organiza-
tion al-Shabaab attacked the 
Kenyan town of Garissa and 
the college that the town 
holds. Almost 150 students 
were killed in the attack, af-
ter which the gunmen took 
hundreds of students hos-
tage. The attack was likely 
a result of tensions between 
the al-Shabaab organiza-
tion, which is a conservative 
Islamist organization linked 
to al-Qaeda, and the Chris-
tian population of the town. 
The organization, thought to 
have been led by Mohamed 
Mohamud, has also been a 
part of previous terror at-
tacks in Kenya, provoking a 
response from the Kenyan 
police and government, 
which have offered a large re-
ward for his capture.

progressive for college cam-
puses,” said Eddy. “The last 
time the smoking policy was 
reviewed, going smoke- or 
tobacco-free was met with a 
lot of opposition.”
Casalegno noted that 
there are smokers on the 
committee, but that many of 
them agree that a smoke-free 
campus is in the best interest 
of Carnegie Mellon students. 
She additionally noted that 
the policy would not look to 
change an individual’s stance 
on smoking: “If we adopt this 
policy, it is not the university 
saying ‘individual members 
must quit.’ ”
Though the administra-
tion does not wish to actively 
make smokers quit, a support 
system for smokers who wish 
to quit will still be a part of the 
plan. “We do care a lot about 
individuals who consume to-
bacco and wish to receive aid 
in cessation of those habits” 
Casalegno noted.
One could argue that the 
proposed policy is a violation 
of smokers’ basic personal 
freedoms, but this is not the 
stance taken by the commit-
tee. Of the smokers inter-
viewed for this article, nearly 
all stated that the policy 
would inconvenience them.
As for the general student 
body’s opinion, there has not 
been a conclusive smoking 
survey since the one Carnegie 
Mellon’s Healthy U project re-
leased in October. 
The majority of smokers 
who took the survey stated 
that they wished to quit. 
That being said, Eddy further 
stated via email that “the ad-
ministration was concerned 
with survey fatigue in light of 
CMU student experience 
survey and sexual 
assault and 
relationship violence stud-
ies.”
During discussions, the 
committee considered the ef-
fects of secondhand smoke.
“We do not believe the 
current system is suf?cient 
in preventing secondhand 
smoke risks,” Casalegno said. 
“We want to move smok-
ers’ actions to places where 
they have less of an effect on 
others.”
Additionally they dis-
cussed the counter-argument 
for smokers to be able to prac-
tice their habit as they see ?t.
“We have had a very open 
and transparent process with 
engaging the governing bod-
ies and really inviting stu-
dents, faculty, and staff to talk 
to their constituencies and 
give us feedback,” Casaleg-
no said. “So the input we’ve 
received from people who 
choose to use tobacco, includ-
ing members on our commit-
tee, [has helped] us shape 
what we think is the best 
approach.”
Smoking policy goes to vote
policy double major Trevor 
Hadick was elected over soph-
omore math and economics 
double major Ryan LaPré as 
student body vice president 
for organizations (SBVPO). 
Hadick received 42.42 per-
cent of the vote, while LaPré 
received 29.16 percent.
This year’s election demon-
strated a signi?cant increase 
in student participation. 26.22 
percent of total students cast 
votes, compared with 17.9 
percent in 2014. 41.06 per-
cent of undergraduates voted, 
compared with 32.43 percent 
in 2014. Meanwhile, 10.36 
percent of graduate students 
voted, almost triple the num-
ber who voted last year.
The election was “quite a 
ride,” Marshall said. He added 
that it was “really encouraging 
to get the campus involved in 
an election” and that all stu-
dents “deserve a student gov-
ernment that works for them.”
According to Ayo-Ani, she 
and Marshall crafted a plat-
form that addressed as many 
students as possible in an ef-
fort to increase student par-
ticipation in the election. “Our 
goal from the very beginning 
was to get as many people in-
volved as possible,” she said.
“Students are coming to re-
alize what an important time 
this is in our long-term histo-
ry,” Marshall said. He is con?-
dent that students are starting 
to “take ownership of the fu-
ture of Carnegie Mellon.”
Marshall and Ayo-Ani ran 
on a platform that emphasized 
mental health awareness and 
efforts to combat sexual as-
sault and relationship violence 
on campus, including getting 
all campus leaders certi?ed 
in the Survivor Support Net-
work. In addition, they want 
to expand acceptance of DineX 
at businesses close to campus 
and establish a “Reorienta-
tion Day” in the middle of the 
semester to facilitate students’ 
mindfulness.
Current SBP and senior 
electrical and computer engi-
neering and business admin-
istration double major Ian 
Glasner re?ected on his own 
tenure as SBP so far at Sen-
ate last week, citing successful 
campaigns such as the Proud 
to Be Plaid initiative and com-
mittee, the student initiatives 
website, and the Jared L. Co-
hon University Center expan-
sion plan.
Glasner’s administration 
also fought to decrease ex-
ceptions to the university’s 
moratorium on having classes 
between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 
p.m., so that all students can 
participate in extracurricu-
lars, and to internalize Carn-
egie Mellon’s alcohol citation 
policy.
Glasner emphasized that, 
though many of his initiatives 
have become reality, there are 
still some that have yet to be 
corrected, such as housing and 
dining prices, which are much 
higher than those of off-cam-
pus options. He stressed that 
larger student movements are 
necessary to make the changes 
to these policies. “Housing 
and dining are not going to 
improve until that happens,” 
Glasner said.
Marshall and Ayo-Ani do 
not wish to set any ?rst prior-
ity for tackling their adminis-
tration’s initiatives, as there 
are “so many issues of equal 
importance that can’t wait,” 
Marshall said.
They are already engaged 
in an “orchestrated, synthe-
sized effort to set [their ini-
tiatives] in motion right away 
and get the right people in 
place,” Marshall said.
“[We’re] reaching out to 
administration to move from 
feasibility talks to talks of lo-
gistics,” Ayo-Ani said.
Each of their initiatives 
starts with student town halls, 
according to Marshall, to show 
that students’ voices are their 
administration’s top priority.
“We want to help give 
people that springboard to do 
great things here,” Ayo-Ani 
said.
“We’re not superheroes,” 
Marshall said, “but this stu-
dent body is made up of super-
heroes.”
Marshall spoke of his work-
ing relationship with Ayo-Ani 
saying, “We really consider 
ourselves a team. We share the 
same goals, the same values, 
and the same future for this 
campus.”
Marshall additionally ex-
pressed his desire to integrate 
their former competition into 
their administration: “We 
want to work with our com-
petitors. They were so gra-
cious, full of integrity, and 
real pleasure to run against, 
and they will continue to be 
just as much a part of the team 
... to make the future a little 
brighter.”
“We’re really thankful 
that the student body would 
choose us to lead us through 
next year,” said Marshall. “We 
really believe we can leave 
[Carnegie Mellon] a lot better 
than how we found it.”

and the Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA).
“The space would have 
been opened up for auction 
for all different parties,” said 
junior information systems 
major and Senate Chair Evan 
Wineland. In his words, Casa-
legno and Murphy’s gesture 
indicated, “We want you guys 
to have priority.”
Once Student Senate and 
the GSA responded positively 
to the idea of purchasing the 
space for student use, the 
question arose how to divide 
and design the space for opti-
mal use.
Division of Space
Vaughan explained that a 
natural division of space arose 
because of a stairwell in the 
center of the shell space lay-
out.
In terms of size, GSA’s share 
is 1,534 nonlinear square feet, 
while Senate’s portion occu-
pies 3,025 nonlinear square 
feet.
Both bodies plan to pro-
ceed relatively independently, 
each with their own designs 
and plans for ?nancing their 
respective spaces.
Senate: Vision of a 
Collaborative Space
To determine a function for 
the shell space, Senate hosted 
a number of tabling events to 
launch the discussion, draw-
ing feedback from students 
who approached their table 
and completed their surveys.
From the survey results, 
Senate concluded that stu-
dents primarily wanted collab-
orative study space, followed 
by dining and music spaces. 
This response prompted a sec-
ond iteration of the survey, in 
which Senate asked, “What 
are the adjectives that make 
you think of a more collabora-
tive space?”
“We feel like we’ve collect-
ed robust enough feedback,” 
Wineland said.
In terms of what “collabor-
ative space” means, Vaughan 
described it as an “open, mul-
tifunctional space where peo-
ple can ?exibly adjust how it’s 
being used.”
Junior decision science 
major and Senate shell space 
committee chair Julia Eddy 
said, “We’re looking to expand 
capacity for midday kind of ac-
tivities.”
“There’s not a single purely 
academic space in the [Cohon] 
University Center because it’s 
supposed to be the focal point 
of other aspects of student 
life,” Wineland explained. But 
right now, Wineland said, “It’s 
crowded. It’s cramped.”
The goal is to “make sure 
that there is more opportunity 
for student to relax,” Wine-
land said.
To streamline efforts to-
ward planning for the space, 
a Senate shell space commit-
tee emerged, comprising six 
student senators and chaired 
by Eddy.
“Even though the commit-
tee is exclusively senators, 
they were elected to repre-
sent the student body,” said 
sophomore economics major 
and Dietrich College senator 
Vaasavi Unnava. “They repre-
sent a pretty diverse group of 
colleges and years.”
GSA: Vision of a Graduate 
Student Lounge
While Senate conducted 
its own discussion of how 
shell space should be used for 
undergraduate students, the 
GSA saw its opportunity to 
dedicate space speci?cally to 
the graduate student experi-
ence.
“Campus feels completely 
dominated by undergrads,” 
Wineland acknowledged.
Vaughan elaborated, “The 
[CUC] isn’t a center for grad 
students; it’s a hub for under-
grads.”
According to GSA Presi-
dent and Ph.D. candidate in 
rhetoric Carolyn Commer, the 
inspiration for a graduate stu-
dent lounge is drawn from the 
GSA-sponsored coffee shop 
that existed many years ago on 
campus, sometimes referred 
to as the “Liquid Sky Cafe” or 
the “Ivory Tower.”
“Our current vision is a bit 
of a revival of that old coffee 
shop as a casual lounge space 
where all graduate students 
are welcome to socialize, col-
laborate, or study,” Commer 
explained via email.
As part of that vision, the 
space is currently intended 
to include large, rectangular 
tables for group discussion, as 
well as small tables and mov-
able furniture “for either indi-
vidual study or more intimate 
coffee house-style conversa-
tion.” Also featured will be a 
kitchenette offering tea and 
coffee.
According to Commer, 
GSA collected feedback from 
and offered opportunities for 
involvement for graduate stu-
dents over the past two aca-
demic years.
In academic year 2013–14, 
that feedback mostly consist-
ed of updates and open dis-
cussion in meetings with GSA 
representatives, and in April 
2014, GSA representatives 
began sending email requests 
for feedback to graduate stu-
dents and inviting them to join 
the GSA grad space planning 
committee.
In September 2014 and 
February 2015, GSA proceed-
ed with strategic planning 
sessions with GSA representa-
tives and other graduate stu-
dents to identify what gradu-
ate students need most out of 
the space.
Financing
Preliminary estimates for 
cost of the space are $191,750 
for GSA and $378,125 for Sen-
ate, according to Vaughan. 
However, by multiple ac-
counts, these number are sub-
ject to change substantially 
once the design details come 
into focus.
“My hunch is they will pull 
back from that,” Vaughan said. 
“You don’t need to be at these 
numbers to do what you want 
with this space.”
Wineland and Eddy both 
described the question of ?-
nancing the space as a “chick-
en-and-egg” problem.
“We want the architects to 
tell us what we can get with a 
certain price range,” Wineland 
said. 
At the same time, however, 
the architects need design de-
tails for an accurate estimate, 
while student government 
wants to keep those details 
vague to keep the cost ?ex-
ible as they look for means of 
?nancing the project.
Regardless of actual ?nal 
cost, Senate doesn’t have the 
funds to pay for the space up-
front. Knowing this, Casaleg-
no and Murphy have offered 
to loan student government 
the funds — at no interest — 
to be paid back in no more 
than 10 years.
To express its commitment 
to ?nancing the shell space, 
Student Senate has put forth a 
deposit of $50,000. According 
to Wineland, $18,000 of that 
money came from budget al-
locations, while Senate with-
drew the remaining $32,000 
from its reserve, leaving about 
$10,000 left in the reserve.
“Previously, that money 
had been stagnant,” Wineland 
explained.
GSA is still determining 
from where it would draw its 
funds. According to a written 
statement from GSA Vice Pres-
ident of Finance Mark Whiting 
via Commer, a Community Im-
provement Fund was started a 
few years ago as part of the 
endowment — a fund which 
could cover a large fraction of 
annual loan payments toward 
shell space.
Other methods of obtain-
ing funds include “using a 
small amount of our capital, 
consolidating some main 
expenses, or raising funds 
through events or standard ac-
tivities fee growth. 
Another option which has 
not been ruled out is to use a 
very small percentage of the 
student body’s activities fee 
account to help in funding 
the entire shell space buildout 
project.”
Part of the issue, Vaughan 
explained, is not just a matter 
of ?nding the money, but also 
justifying allocating funds to-
ward shell space when it could 
have been spent elsewhere: 
“How do we best leverage our 
money so we aren’t reducing 
services and programming to 
the point that it’s harming the 
student experience in other 
ways?”
Next Steps
For GSA, the primary next 
step will be reforming its grad-
uate student space planning 
committee, as many of its cur-
rent members will graduate at 
the end of this academic year, 
according to Commer. 
That committee will re-
spond to upcoming designs 
from the architects and pres-
ent those designs to the 
student body, as well as so-
licit feedback and student 
artwork.
Meanwhile, Eddy and 
the shell space committee 
are looking to draft a gen-
eral plan for Campus De-
sign to get an up-to-date es-
timate from the architects.

The SSN is a re-vamped 
version of what used to be 
called the sexual assault advi-
sors, according to Klein. The 
program trains campus com-
munity members to respond 
to requests for help from 
sexual assault survivors and 
focuses on changing the per-
ception and stigma of sexual 
assault on campus. While on 
campus, Klein has trained 
over 150 members of the SSN.
“All I’m doing is telling 
society how to be people — 
teaching them about why 
this exists in the ?rst place: 
because there’s a lack of re-
spect,” Klein said. “My only 
contribution is really to tell 
people that we can change 
that. I want people to know 
that we have an SSN on cam-
pus. I want it to be engrained 
in the culture here that we 
have a support network.”
Evan Wineland, junior in-
formation systems major and 
chair of the undergraduate 
Student Senate, has also been 
trained by Klein. He said that 
her work has made him think 
harder about the way he acts: 
“Jess challenges all of us to 
rethink what we’ve been con-
ditioned by society to take for 
granted.”
“The bigger picture is get-
ting people to understand 
that we create this problem,” 
Klein said. “This isn’t biologi-
cal. This isn’t DNA. This isn’t 
genetic. This is a socially 
constructed problem. These 
problems are more than what 
we see. I wish we could all 
look at the complexities of it 
and understand what it is.”
From the outside, it can 
appear that ?ghting sexual 
assault and relationship vio-
lence on campus is an uphill 
battle. 
The number of sexual as-
saults on campus has never 
been higher and continues to 
rise. Carnegie Mellon report-
ed in its 2014 Annual Security 
and Fire Safety Report that 
the number of on-campus as-
saults reported tripled from 
2011 to 2013. 
This statistic could indi-
cate a higher willingness to 
report and that it is becoming 
easier for survivors to report 
their experiences at Carnegie 
Mellon, an assumption that 
this study could verify.
While the study is de-
signed to help report more 
accurate numbers than those 
contained in the annual re-
port, it is also designed to 
gauge on-campus sentiment 
regarding the efforts, accord-
ing to Klein and Sobhani.
“There hasn’t even ever 
been a survey of this type be-
fore,” Sobhani said. “This sur-
vey is powerful in that it looks 
in-depth at how students feel 
about these issues on campus. 
The Clery Act is helpful for 
spitting out statistics, but we 
need real student feedback.”
According to Klein, the stu-
dent attitude at the university 
is still cynical of the univer-
sity’s transparency, and she 
often struggles with students’ 
views of these situations.
“We’re doing a lot of things 
right here,” Klein said. 
“I was a student once, but 
now I see it from the admin-
istration’s side. There are a lot 
of people who care about this 
very much and are taking this 
survey and the results we’ll 
get from it very seriously. 
We’re lucky here. [President 
Subra Suresh] supports it, 
[Casalengo] supports it, and 
they’re amazing advocates. 
It’s a top-down approach.”
Both Klein and Sobhani 
stressed the importance of 
students’ honest participa-
tion in the survey. The results 
of the survey will dictate how 
both Klein’s of?ce and the 
SSN will designate their time 
in the future, Klein said.
“It’s con?dential, so even 
if this is just a situation that 
only came up once in your 
life, this is your chance to 
vocalize it and how you feel 
about it to the administration 
on your own time from your 
room,” Sobhani said.
Klein is encouraged by the 
students she works with and 
the administration and facul-
ty members that support both 
her and her work at Carneige 
Mellon: “The mission is to 
get people to understand the 
complexities of gender-based 
violence. Once they have an 
understanding, that changes 
perspectives of people. That’s 
where we start.... Stuff like 
this isn’t easy to talk about 
or assess, so the data from 
this survey is going to tell us 
where we are as an institution 
and what we need to change 
to make it better here for 
everyone.”

Energy-saving exoskeleton makes walking easier
Engineers at Carnegie 
Mellon University have re-
cently developed a mechanical 
exoskeleton boot that, in com-
parison to normal footwear, 
reduces the energy expendi-
ture of walking by 7 percent. 
The device is the ?rst of its 
kind to not rely on an outside 
power source.
In the exoskeleton boot, a 
mechanical clutch is used to 
hold a spring that expands and 
contracts during ankle move-
ments. When a person swings 
their leg forward to walk, the 
clutch locks into place and the 
spring expands, allowing the 
spring to store elastic energy. 
Once the leg pushes down 
on the ground, propelling 
the body forward, the clutch 
loosens and the elastic en-
ergy is released as the spring 
slackens. In turn, this process 
can reduce the energy needed 
from the wearer’s calf muscle.
The team hopes their prod-
uct will be commercially avail-
able to consumers who want 
to improve walking ef?ciency, 
particularly those with walk-
ing dif?culties. A report was 
published in the journal Na-
ture.

Scientists plan to send man to planet Mars by 2033
According to space experts, 
the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) 
may be able to fund a project 
that could send humans into 
Mars’ orbit by 2033, and allow 
the ?rst human to walk on the 
surface of Mars by 2039.
A discussion about the cost 
of the project occurred during 
a workshop hosted by the Plan-
etary Society. The event took 
place in Washington, D.C. Ac-
cording to Bill Nye, who is the 
CEO of the Planetary Society, 
the Mars program would be 
affordable once NASA leaves 
its lead role in the Internation-
al Space Station.
During the estimated 30 
months of the Mars orbital 
mission, crew members would 
be able to study the moons of 
Mars, as well as possibly re-
motely operate rovers on the 
Martian surface. 
However, the experts be-
lieve that the biggest hurdle in 
starting the project lies within 
politics.
It was announced that the 
mission architecture, which 
has until now been closed to 
the public and press, will be 
released later this year.

New biosensing platform may help diagnose disease
Researchers at Florida At-
lantic University, along with 
other collaborators, have cre-
ated a novel biosensing plat-
form that may be able to re-
motely diagnose and identify 
treatment options for HIV and 
bacterial infections, such as 
Staphylococcus aureus.
According to their article in 
Nature, the researchers devel-
oped biosensors with low-cost 
paper and ?exible materials 
that contain electrical and 
optical sensing modalities, 
which are reported to be easy 
to make and use. 
The researchers have also 
developed a complementary 
phone app that can use photos 
to diagnose bacterial diseases 
in the patient’s blood.
The researchers believe 
that their methods may help 
to create affordable tools in 
diagnostics and health moni-
toring, particularly in poorer 
countries with limited access 
to resources and laboratory 
infrastructure. 
This new platform could 
also be altered in order to di-
agnose diseases and patho-
gens other than HIV and bac-
terial infections.

New test could improve detection of prostate cancer
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Central Florida have 
discovered a simple test that 
uses gold nanoparticles to 
detect early-stage prostate 
cancer.
The test involves mixing 
only a couple drops of blood 
with gold nanoparticles. If the 
patient has prostate cancer, 
biomarkers present in his or 
her blood from his or her im-
mune response will attach to 
the nanoparticles and cause 
them to clump together. The 
size of the nanoparticles is 
then measured through a 
technique called nanoparticle-
enabled dynamic light scatter-
ing assay. Larger nanoparticles 
indicate cancer growth.
This new test offers a vari-
ety of bene?ts over traditional 
methods, as it costs less than 
$1 and can provide results 
within minutes. Initial studies 
of the test have also shown it to 
be more sensitive and more ac-
curate than standard prostate 
speci?c antigen (PSA) screen-
ings. The transition from PSA 
screenings to this new tech-
nology could also decrease the 
number of patients required to 
receive invasive biopsies.

3.67 million-year-old fossil found in central South Africa
A rare Australopithecus 
skeleton discovered in a cave 
in central South Africa about 
twenty years ago has been 
estimated to be 3.67 million 
years old, making it one of 
oldest hominid skeletons ever 
dated. 
The skeleton was previ-
ously believed to be about  3 
million years old. 
Known as Little Foot, this 
ancestor was determined to 
predate Lucy, the famed 3.2 
million-year-old Australo-
pithecus skeleton that was 
found in Ethiopia in 1974. 
With Little Foot, scientists 
were able to conclude that the 
earliest australopithecines ex-
isted in South Africa.
However, the species that 
australopithecine Little Foot 
belongs to remains unknown 
among scientists. Addition-
ally, based on the ?ndings, 
scientists have concluded that 
there was a great diversity of 
human ancestors in various 
locations in Africa. 
Furthermore, evidence 
from Little Foot may disclose 
the particular region and spe-
cies that led to the emergence 
of the modern human race.

Dinosaur couple found buried together in Mongolia
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Alberta have identi?ed 
a dinosaur couple that had 
been buried together for more 
than 75 million years. The re-
mains were uncovered in the 
Gobi desert in Mongolia.
According to the report in 
the journal Scienti?c Reports, 
the dinosaurs, a pair of ovi-
raptors, had possessed differ-
ent physical characteristics, 
enough to indicate that they 
were male and female. Since 
the oviraptor couple was bird-
like, the researchers compared 
the remains to the anatomy of 
modern birds. The research-
ers were then able to iden-
tify physical traits that could 
have allowed for courtship to 
take place between the two 
dinosaurs.
It is believed that the ovi-
raptors were killed when 
a sand dune collapsed and 
buried them alive. Hence, 
researchers nicknamed the 
dinosaur couple “Romeo and 
Juliet.”

Imaging explains disease progression

Medicine and technol-
ogy are a unique and impor-
tant combination. Scientists’ 
understanding of diseases 
has changed signi?cantly in 
recent years due to new in-
sights provided by advanced 
techniques. 
Michael Miller, a professor 
of biomedical and electrical 
and computer engineering 
at Johns Hopkins University 
and the director of the Center 
for Imaging Science, visited 
Carnegie Mellon last week 
as part of the seminar series 
for Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh’s 
joint Ph.D. program in Com-
putational Biology (CPCB), 
and shared his work on using 
images to better understand 
the progression of neurode-
generative diseases.
Miller described his ?eld 
as computational anatomy. 
His group’s goal is to develop 
new techniques to analyze 
images relating structure to 
disease. 
Computational anatomy is 
not a novel idea, and others 
have attempted in the past 
to capitalize on the power of 
computation and the clarity 
of imaging. However, Miller’s

Automated Braille Tutor wins Touch of Genius Prize
DANIELLE HU
Staffwriter
TechBridgeWorld, a re-
search group under Carne-
gie Mellon University’s Field 
Robotics Institute, received 
the Louis Braille Touch of 
Genius Price for Innovation 
for the year of 2014. 
The $20,000 prize is dis-
tributed to multiple orga-
nizations and individuals 
every year in hopes of hon-
oring those who implement 
innovative technologies to 
help improve the ?eld of tac-
tile literacy. The Automated 
Braille Tutor, developed 
by students and research-
ers in TechBridgeWorld, 
was awarded $15,000 out 
of the $20,000 for its de-
velopments and impact on 
partnering institutes from 
around the world.
TechBridgeWorld was 
founded in 2004 by M. Ber-
nardine Dias, an associ-
ate research professor in 
Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics 
Institute. The goal of this re-
search group aims to blend 
together advancements in 
technology and their imple-
mentations in lesser known 
communities. In particular, 
TechBridgeWorld focuses 
on helping people who live 
in developing countries and 
people with disabilities in 
the areas of education and 
assistance. 
The Automated Braille 
Tutor exempli?es a blend of 
these two ?elds by provid-
ing assistive technology to 
those who are blind to help 
improve literacy. Other proj-
ects that TechBridgeWorld 
has been involved with in-
clude NavPal, a mobile ap-
plication aimed to help aid 
indoor navigation for blind 
and deafblind users, and 
Assistive Robots for Blind 
Travelers.
The Automated Braille 
Tutor project was started 
in 2006 by two robotics 
Ph.D. students, Nidhi Kalra 
and Tom Lauwers. Initially, 
the two students were in-
vested in this project as an 
independent study through 
TechBridgeWorld. 
Kalra and Lauwers con-
tacted and tested the tutor 
on students in the Mathru 
School for the Blind, in 
Bengaluru, India. Teachers 
and students had positive 
feedback toward the proejct 
at the time. Over the years, 
due to its success, the study 
has been kept alive and con-
tinues to live through the 
support of students at Carn-
egie Mellon.
The ?rst tutor device de-
veloped connects to a USB 
port on a laptop. 
The board has typical 
buttons that allow users to 
navigate through menu op-
tions, an enlarged center 
Braille cell, and a bottom 
slate portion with multiple 
Braille cells that mimic the 
typical Braille slates that are 
used with a stylus. Once the 
device is turned on, students 
hear instructions from the 
device teaching them about 
topics such as the alphabet, 
spelling, and numbers. The 
tutor’s software also imple-
ments the built-in voice of 
a Mathru teacher, who pro-
vides feedback to the actions 
of the student. For example, 
if the device was running 
through the alphabet, the 
automated voice would di-
rect the student to press par-
ticular cells to spell out the 
respective letters. 
An important aspect to 
keep in mind is that in order 
for blind people to write, the 
construction of Braille writ-
ings need to be punched in 
from right to left with each 
letter’s mirror image. Once 
the writing is complete, the

Are plants conscious? 
Do roses scream when their 
stems are cut? Can plants 
smell or hear? These are 
a handful of the questions 
that plant researchers have 
recently sought to answer. 
In the pursuit of discerning 
whether or not plants are in-
telligent, we are left asking 
ourselves, “What is intelli-
gence?” and what it means to 
be able to smell or to hear.
Plant neurobiology is an 
emerging ?eld of research 
which seeks to understand 
the mechanisms behind 
plants’ sensory and adaptive 
faculties. However, neuro-
biology is a misnomer since 
plants do not have nerve 
cells or a nervous system like 
animals do. The ?eld’s ac-
ceptance has been set back 
by previous pseudoscienti?c 
experiments which “proved” 
that plants have emotions 
and can be affected by human 
thoughts, among other new-
age ideas. Some legitimate 
neurobiologists now argue 
that plants possess structures 
that are analogous to a ner-
vous system. Experiments 
studying plant sensation have 
shown evidence that plants 
live sensuous lives, perhaps 
possessing as many as twenty 
different sensory modalities.
Charles Darwin, the father 
of natural selection and evo-
lutionary theory, partnered 
with his son Francis to per-
form many experiments on 
the roots — or “reticles” — of 
plants. Darwin hypothesized 
that plants behave like up-
side-down animals, with the 
roots (the brain) underneath 
the soil, and the sex organs 
(?owers, seeds and pollen) 
on the outside. 
Michael Pollan, a writer 
for The New Yorker, asserts 
in his article, “The Intelli-
gent Plant,” that plant roots 
can sense not only mois-
ture, light, pressure, gravity,

The use of the Braille 
Tutor not only bene?ts blind 
students by improving their 
literacy, but also entertains 
them. For example, the “Ani-
mal Game” plays an audio clip 
of the noise an animal makes, 
and in response, the student 
spells out the name of the 
animal that made the noise. 
Project manager of the Auto-
mated Braille Tutor, Ermine 
Teves, states that, hopefully, 
“giving them the means to en-
hance their literacy will allow 
them to become active mem-
bers of society.” 
With a better understand-
ing of reading and writing, 
blind people can pursue high-
er education, help teach oth-
ers who are blind, and hold 
industrial and technical posi-
tions similar to those without 
disabilities. In general, the 
device has been received well 
by both students and teach-
ers. For teachers, “the idea 
here is not to replace them,” 
Teves said. “We want to make 
their lives easier.”
 Most teachers in Mathru 
are blind themselves, often 
making the process of teach-
ing literacy dif?cult without 
any technical assistance. The 
need for a teacher to provide 
feedback to every student 
would not only be very time 
consuming, but would also 
cost a lot in terms of the ?-
nancial investment in Braille 
paper.
Over the years, teachers 
and students have provided 
TechBridgeWorld with feed-
back on how to improve the 
design of the tutor. The most 
demanded request was a de-
vice that worked indepen-
dently from a laptop. Since 
then, progress has been made 
with Stand Alone Automated 
Braille Tutors. A functional 
beginner’s device has been 
implemented and serves as 
a prototype, whereas inter-
mediate and advanced tutors 
will be explored in the future. 
These standalone devices are 
powered by batteries and con-
nect to mobile speakers to al-
low for mobility and ease of 
access.
Both undergraduate- and 
graduate-level students are 
involved with TechBridge-
World. Innovative Student 
Technology Experience 
(iSTEP) is a 10-week sum-
mer internship program for 
TechBridgeWorld that heavily 
involves technology’s impacts 
on outside connections. 
Although 2015 will be 
the last year that iSTEP will 
be offered, the group of four 
students participating in the 
internship will work on fur-
thering the research for the 
Automated Braille Tutor.
The upcoming iSTEP team 
will pursue comparative user 
studies this summer to con-
tinue to enhance the new de-
vices in Mathru.

We spend hours on our 
phones and computers, tap-
ping away at the brightly 
colored screens in search 
of the next dopamine rush. 
Games like Candy Crush are 
designed to take advantage 
of our psychology and be 
as addictive as possible. For 
some users, this leads to mas-
sive amounts of in-game pur-
chases, despite the fact that 
the game is ostensibly free

discussed the ethical issues 
that come up when games 
become dangerously close to 
gambling.
What may have started as

The line between games 
like Candy Crush or Trivia

of chance like poker or slot 
machines is getting blurrier 
and blurrier. People fall into 
the “gambler’s fallacy,” the 
sort of thinking that causes 
slot players to continue pay-

thinking that if they just play 
one more round, they’ll be 
able to hit the jackpot (or 
the high score). And besides, 
what’s 99 cents here or $1.29 
there?
The people who tend to 
suffer most from this behav-
ior are primarily the unedu-
cated and poor. State lotter-
ies are often called the poor 
man’s tax for this reason, 
and it is for the same reason 
that there are laws against 
gambling or online poker. 
Pugwash discussed regulat-
ing online games in the same 
manner, but it acknowledged 
that regulating anything on-
line gets a little dif?cult. 
Another proposed solu-
tion was to require a promi-
nent noti?cation of how 
much money users have spent 
on the game, similar to how 
cigarette packages in some 
countries graphically feature 
the consequences of smok-
ing. This might help people 
who don’t realize how much 
they’re spending because 
it’s only charged in small 
amounts.
There was also some dis-
cussion of the various types 
of free games that have in-
game purchases, or “free-
mium” games. They’re called 
that because while they may 
be free to play, the premium 
features cost extra. 
There are three main ways 
that developers make money 
on these games. One is to have 
in-game advertisements. Al-
though this doesn’t cost the 
consumer any money, it isn’t 
very effective for making 
money, because each ad view 
is only worth a very small 
amount. 
Another is to have the 
game let everyone play a little 
for free, but limit the amount 
users can play. If you run out 
of gameplay, you either have 
to wait a set amount of time 
to store up more, or you can 
pay to play more right away. 
The other main way to 
Mobile games raise questions about addictive technology

Many apps today include in-app purchases, which can become addictive. This raises questions about app design and whether there should be regulation on these types of purchases.

and hardness, but can also 
sense salts, toxins, volume, 
chemical signals from nearby 
plants, as well as determining 
whether nearby roots are kin-
dred or stranger and there-
fore if it should cooperate or 
compete with them. The Dar-
winian view takes these sens-
es into account and claims 
that the root is the most anal-
ogous structure to the brain 
in animals, though plants and 
animals are so different that 
even analogous comparisons 
are fuzzy.
The mechanisms of plants’ 
senses, however, are getting 
less fuzzy. 
Recent research by Frank 
Kuhnemann and a team of sci-
entists at the Institute for Ap-
plied Physics at the University 
of Bonn have found, through 
highly complex experiments, 
that plants can be said to 
scream when they experience 
trauma, such as having their 
stems or leaves cut. 
When plants are trauma-
tized in this way, they release 
a hormone called ethylene, 
which causes ripening. When 
the gaseous hormone is cap-
tured and vibrated through 
laser bombardment, it pro-
duces sound waves which are 
recorded via microphones. 
According to Kuhnemann, the 
more stress the plant has in-
curred, the more intense the 
sound will be.
Ethylene is also a prime 
example of a plant’s ability to 
smell. 
The sense of smell is, at its 
most basic level, the ability 
of organisms to take in air-
borne chemical signals, inter-
pret them, and react to them. 
Ethylene causes ripening in 
nearby plants in exactly this 
way — one plant will release 
the hormone into the air, and 
nearby plants will take it in. 
This is why people store rip-
ening fruit in paper bags; it 
traps the ethylene and allows 
the fruit to more easily com-
municate with each other and 
ripen at the same time. 
There are also parasitic 
plants called “dodder vines” 
which are able to “sniff out” 
plants they ?nd most deli-
cious. “Given the choice of 
tomato or wheat, the dod-
der picks the tomato,” said 
plant biologist Consuelo M. 
De Moraes of Pennsylvania 
State University, a member of 
the team that conducted the 
experiment.
Perhaps the most contro-
versial ?nding in the realm 
of plant neurobiology is the 
idea that plants can learn. 
Monica Gagliano, an animal 
ecologist at the University of 
Western Australia, studied 
the plant Mimosa pudica. Mi-
mosa is known as “the sensi-
tive plant” because its leaves 
instantly collapse when 
touched, a re?ex thought to 
frighten attacking insects. 
Gagliano wanted to see if she 
could condition the ?fty-six 
plants to learn to ignore an 
innocuous stimulus through 
a type of learning called ha-
bituation. She dropped the 
plants repeatedly from a safe 
distance about sixty times per 
trial, and after some time, the 
plants habituated to, or ig-
nored, the stimulus of being 
dropped. 
What was even more in-
teresting was that the plants 
were able to hold onto this in-
formation for at least a month. 
The plants exhibited not only 
a form of rudimentary learn-
ing, but a form of long-term 
memory as well. The mecha-
nisms by which this occurs 
are still under examination, 
but recent hypotheses have 
surmised that plant memory 
might be due to changes in 
genetic expression.
Perhaps the root of the 
rich sensory experiences of 
plants can be attributed to 
their immobility. This evolu-
tionary constriction severely 
limits plants’ abilities to es-
cape predators and survive. 
In order for this seemingly 
crippling modality to carry 
through generation after gen-
eration, it has to be conducive 
to plants’ successful survival. 
The root of a plant, as stated 
by Darwin, is essentially the 
most “conscious” area. One 
of the most intriguing root-
based interactions, apart 
from the highly sensitive sen-
sory capabilities, is the phe-
nomenon of the “wood-wide 
web.” 
Michael Pollan writes 
about an experiment per-
formed by Suzanne Simard 
from the University of British 
Columbia, in which the team 
injected ?r trees with a radio-
active carbon isotope and fol-
lowed their spread through-
out the forest community. 
They established that there is 
an underground network of 
fungi called mycelium which 
is used by stronger, older 
trees to feed young saplings. 
Evergreen ?rs would also 
trade sugars with deciduous 
trees during the cold months, 
and the evergreens would call 
in those debts later on; Pol-
lan calls this system of under-
ground commerce an “under-
ground economy,” which is 
bene?cial to all involved.
The realm of plant neu-
robiology may not be well 
funded or popular among 
scholars, but there are great 
rami?cations in the study of 
plants. 
By studying the sensory 
abilities of organisms so dif-
ferent from ourselves, we 
break free from potentially 
egocentric ideas that nervous 
systems are inherently neces-
sary for intelligence, and we 
gain insight into the rich lives 
and capabilities of the life all 
around us. 
So next time you trudge 
through a forest or buy a bou-
quet of fresh-cut roses, think 
of the rich economy of fungus 
and ?r, and the faint screams 
of agony coming silently from 
those ?owers.

HOW THINGS WORK
PLANT, from A5
Eunice Mok/Staff Artist
make money is to have the 
entire game free, and no 
limits on play time, but to 
charge for extras that change 
the way the game looks or 
to increase users’ abilities in 
game.
While most traditional 
gamers look down upon 
the new genre of freemium 
games, a Pugwash member 
mentioned that he knew 
someone who had moved 
from working in traditional 
game development to work-
ing in the freemium world. 
He had been disappointed 
with the game industry not 
living up to its promises, like 
when a trailer for a game is 
not representative of actual 
gameplay. 
However, because there 
is very little feedback during 
development and because 
early sales are so important 
to making money, it contin-
ues to happen.
 He moved to freemium 
games because he saw their 
model as being better all 
around. The developer would 
make a game, and if people 
liked it, they would provide 
a continuous, sustainable 
source of income, instead of 
developers working behind 
closed doors hoping that 
there would be enough one-
time purchases to make their 
work worth it.
This person ended up 
leaving where he worked in 
the freemium industry, how-
ever, because the moneti-
zation was too much and it 
wasn’t as idyllic a model as 
he had hoped. Every feature 
he was putting into a game 
had to be justi?ed to higher-
ups as to how it would make 
more money. 
While it is interesting to 
see the freemium games as 
a different, more sustainable 
model for gaming, that is 
not what is actually happen-
ing. They still are just being 
exploited to earn as much 
money as they can.
Additionally, Pugwash 
discussed how to use the 
addictiveness of games for 
good. 
Visiting Pugwash was a 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus 
who now works at Duolin-
go, a free, online language-
learning app. They use 
gami?cation to try and get 
people addicted to some-
thing bene?cial. 
They’re looking into many 
of the same ways to earn 
money that the freemium 
games use, such as offering 
different cosmetic changes 
for money. However, they 
want to avoid making it “pay 
to play” or putting content

Images show brain structure
IMAGE, from A5
The more we learn about how 
the human brain works, the 
more we’ll be able to optimize 
experiences that tickle our 
pleasure centers. These addicting 
techniques can be used for good, 
as Duolingo showed us with their 
language-learning app, or for 
purely pro?t-able motives, like in 
the freemium game industry. 
ADDICTIVE, from A6
Raghu Avula/Staffwriter
Michael Miller, a professor of biomedical and electrical and computer engineering and director of the Center 
for Imaging Science at Johns Hopkins, spoke at Carnegie Mellon this past week about applications of imaging. 
aspects of structure have 
changed over time.
Their approach is very in-
volved and utilizes the tools 
of linear algebra to effortless-
ly understand the changes be-
tween two pictures. A paral-
lel can be drawn to the games 
we played as kids where we 
had to ?nd the differences 
between two images. 
Miller’s team developed a 
method to look at each point 
in an image and compare it 
to a relative point on a simi-
lar image. The goal is to de-
termine whether the point of 
interest has changed in any 
way relative to shape or size.
This approach is related 
to diffeomorphism, which is 
the metric study of shape and 
form. 
Using two dimensional or 
three dimensional images, 
Miller and his team develop 
vector ?elds for each image 
and then compare the vec-
tor ?elds to determine differ-
ences. Therefore, each image 
is compared to both itself and 
the other image.
Miller provided an great 
example to explain his 
method. 
Using a map of the world, 
Miller showed points on 
South America and Africa. In 
his explanation, the shapes 
of the continents ?t together 
like puzzle pieces as deter-
mined by their algorithm. 
Each point uses the informa-
tion of its neighboring points 
to determine is position and 
relation to the image which 
allows for a unique analysis. 
An animation showed how 
the two continents joined 
based on the points analyzed 
by Miller’s method. When 
Miller removed the ability for 
points to share information 
with each other, the result 
was chaos. The continents in 
the image transformed into 
something unrecognizable. 
This example showed how 
powerful Miller’s method 
could be.
The images are coupled 
into a network that allows 
scientists to determine the 
?ow of possible changes to an 
image. The goal of this proj-
ect is to determine the struc-
tural changes that occur with 
disease. 
Miller and his group 
utilized a collection of images 
that allowed them compare 
individuals with Alzheimer’s 
to healthy controls. They fo-
cused on the hippocampus 
region of the brain, which is 
known to play a role in the 
disease.
 In addition to comparing 
to healthy controls, Miller 
and his group compared pa-
tients’ brains before and after 
the symptoms appear. Many 
of the patients undergo MRIs 
due to risk for the disease 
and, within 5 – 10 years, they 
develop the disease. This al-
lows Miller and his team to 
create a time course of the 
structural changes in the 
brain upon the advancement 
of Alzheimer’s.
Using statistical models, 
Miller and his team decipher 
which changes are impor-
tant and possibly relevant to 
the disease. They identi?ed 
speci?c areas that show sig-
ni?cant change in relation to 
Alzheimer’s disease. 
These results will allow 
scientists to have a better un-
derstanding of the disease as 
well as identify which areas 
of the brain should be target-
ed by therapeutic drugs.
behind a paywall, because in 
the end, their goal is to pro-
vide a free service.
Finally, Pugwash brie?y 
mentioned how journalism 
is picking up similar tech-
niques. Known as “clickbait,” 
a common practice is to have 
headlines that don’t give out 
very much information, but 
leave readers wondering, 
which causes them to click on 
the link and go to the news 
site. 
This gives the news or-
ganization more page views 
and ad revenue, but readers 
are often left thinking that 
the actual content didn’t live 
up to the headline. However, 
people continue to click on 
enticing headlines for the 
same reason they keep play-
ing slots: Maybe this time it’ll 
be good. 
These practices do de-
grade journalistic integrity 
somewhat, but as long as 
news organizations need 
consumers’ money to run, 
they’ll do what they have to. 
BBC is an example of how a 
stable source of funding, sep-
arate from page views, can 
help combat clickbait.
The more we learn about 
how the human brain works, 
the more we’ll be able to op-
timize experiences that tickle 
our pleasure centers. These 
addicting techniques can 
be used for good, as Duol-
ingo showed us with their 
language-learning app, or 
for purely pro?table motives, 
like in the freemium game 
industry. 
To prevent people from 
being taken advantage of, 
Pugwash seemed to agree 
that there should be some 
regulations in place.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This 
article is a summary of last 
week’s discussion on addictive 
technology.

Elections demonstrated democracy at work at CMU
Ellen Pao is more than symbol for gender equality
Sexual assault survey is encouraging turning point
Last week, 26.22 percent of stu-
dents voted in the student govern-
ment election, including 41.06 per-
cent of undergraduate students and 
10.36 percent of graduate students. 
In last year’s elections, only 17.9 per-
cent of students — 32.21 percent of 
undergraduates and 3.32 percent of 
graduates — voted.
This year’s election represents 
an unprecedented and impressive 
increase in voter turnout from pre-
vious years. Each pair of candidates 
running for student body president 
(SBP) and student body vice presi-
dent (SBVP) presented a platform 
with a set of goals that were relevant 
to the student body, graduate and 
undergraduate.
At a university known for the apa-
thy of its students, higher student 
engagement in this election is a re-
freshing change from previous years. 
Much of this engagement stemmed 
from the candidates for SBP and 
SBVP, who took the election serious-
ly and actively reached out to the stu-
dent body as part of their campaigns.
The Tartan commends the candi-
dates for engaging the student body 
more than ever before; we hope to 
see candidates in future years look to 
this year as an example. Although ju-
nior Chinese studies and policy and 
management major JR Marshall and 
junior information systems major 
Jibbi Ayo-Ani won the election, they 
should take advantage of the other 
motivated candidates by involving 
them as cabinet members and con-
sidering their ideas. This will enable 
Marshall and Ayo-Ani to be stronger 
leaders over the course of the up-
coming academic year.
It’s important that students, espe-
cially those elected to Student Gov-
ernment, do not forget the passion 
and drive of this year’s candidates. 
The candidates for SBP and SBVP 
— as well as those for student body 
vice president for ?nance, student 
body vice president for student orga-
nizations, and Undergraduate Stu-
dent Senate — have inspired more 
students to vote than ever in recent 
memory, creating an important po-
litical dialogue on campus that will 
hopefully lead to tangible change 
over the course of the upcoming 
year.
This past week, Ellen Pao, cur-
rent Reddit interim CEO and for-
mer junior investment partner for 
venture capital ?rm Kleinerm, Per-
kins, Cau?eld & Byers (KPCB), lost 
her class action lawsuit against the 
?rm ?led on the basis of gender 
discrimination.
Pao felt that her male peers being 
promoted to senior partner instead of 
her was a sign of discrimination. She 
began to voice complaints of this in 
December 2011, and was then ?red 
in October 2012. Her lawsuit came 
on the grounds that she was passed 
over for promotion was on the basis 
of gender, and that her ?ring came 
as retaliation to her complaints, but 
jurors reported that their decision 
came down to lack of evidence.
Throughout the ?ve-week trial, 
Pao’s council presented cases of 
subtle workplace sexism, such as 
excluding women from ?rm social 
events because they “kill the buzz,” 
bringing a woman’s maternal sta-
tus into her professional staus, and 
labeling Pao as too assertive and “a 
complainer.” The performance re-
views for Pao stated that she was 
“too resentful.” Higher-ups in KPCB 
described a successful female inves-
tor as one who does not complain. 
None of these are examples of overt, 
illegal gender discrimination, but 
that doesn’t make the behavior ex-
cusable.
These and other examples men-
tioned during testimony show very 
clear signs of a sexist culture at 
KPCB. But because Ellen Pao lost on 
all counts, there will be no legal con-
sequences for the company. Some 
are arguing that the fact that this 
case made it to trial at all is a success 
because of how dif?cult it is to take 
on such a large ?rm. But because 
they’ve gotten away with it, there 
is nothing to stop it from happen-
ing again. It is helpful that the case 
brought attention to the issue and 
the company, and it may put pressure 
on the industry to simulate progress 
until the publicity dies down. But 
what happens then?
There may be no legal basis on 
which to punish KPCB, but the com-
pany needs to held accountable as 
women move closer to workplace 
equality. Raising awareness is not 
enough to take down these multi-
billionaire powerhouses. Washing-
ton needs to step in and introduce 
stricter regulations and punishments 
so that Pao’s case and experiences 
can be more than just symbolic.
Until April 27, students on Carn-
egie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus 
have the chance to give feedback 
on their perception and experiences 
with sexual assault and relationship 
violence (SARV) on campus and how 
the university can better prevent it.
The survey, a result of extensive 
collaboration between the Of?ce of 
Student Life, the Of?ce of the Dean 
of Student Affairs, the Of?ce of 
General Counsel, and the Of?ce of 
Institutional Research and Analysis, 
marks the ?rst major effort to gauge 
not only the numbers behind SARV, 
but the sentiment.
Coordinator of Gender Program-
ming and Sexual Violence Jess Klein 
has been instrumental in this effort, 
as well as the extended survivor sup-
port network. This survey is an im-
portant landmark in the campus’s 
?ght to address SARV and spread 
prevention awareness.
Not only does it individualize the 
questions to make every student’s 
experience unique, but it will come 
with content warnings and a con-
stant reminder that, should students 
be emotionally affected by the con-
tent, they have many resources on 
campus. The survey will provide a 
comprehensive list of these resourc-
es and where to ?nd them.
The Tartan sees great potential 
for the rollout of this survey, the data 
that will come from it, and most im-
portantly, the watershed moment it 
represents for Carnegie Mellon. 
Though the university has not 
always had the best reputation for 
handling issues of SARV on campus 
(think the Beta Theta Pi and a Title 
IX complaint last year), it seems the 
university is making great strides to 
change the way SARV issues are han-
dled on campus.
The Tartan staff will be participat-
ing in this survey, and urges students 
all across campus to do so as well. 
To provide better data to adminis-
tration and faculty, honest feedback 
is important from the student body. 
Campus-wide participation and ac-
curate feedback have the potential to 
improve SARV policies in a way that 
current data, such as information 
compiled in the Annual Security and 
Fire Safety Report, cannot.
In addition, next fall, when the 
results from the survey come out, 
it will be important for the admin-
istration to act thoughtfully with 
the gathered data and to encourage 
student participation in the survivor 
support network and other SARV 
initiatives. We must join together as 
a campus to work to make Carnegie 
Mellon a safer place.

Iran nuclear deal may signal diplomatic future
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Spors Editor
After a seemingly interminable 
period of last-minute negotiating, 
the ?ve permanent members of 
the United Nations (U.N.) Security 
Council with Germany (P5+1) and 
Iran ?nally came to an agreement 
early on Thursday, April 2.
After months of baseless specu-
lation that Obama was giving the 
Iranians a blank check to do as 
they please with the deal, the pub-
lic details of the framework make it 
clear that Iran and the P5+1 have 
achieved a very fair compromise. 
Iran will roll back signi?cant por-
tions of its nuclear program in ex-
change for lifting of crippling sanc-
tions that have crushed its economy 
for nearly 50 years.
Members of the P5+1 are tout-
ing this as a diplomatic solution to 
Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iranian 
leadership feels the combination of 
lifted sanctions and the survival of 
all of their nuclear facilities was suf-
?cient, and the framework for a deal 
was created.
The hits to Iran’s nuclear pro-
gram are massive. The deal includes 
the uninstallation of nearly 13 thou-
sand of Iran’s 19 thousand centrifug-
es; only 5 thousand of the remaining 
centrifuges would be permitted to 
enrich uranium. The enriched ura-
nium will be limited to 3.67 percent, 
which is enough for nuclear power 
but not nearly enough for nuclear 
bombs. Iran may not build any new 
enrichment facilities. Iran’s current 
stockpile of 10 thousand kilograms 
of enriched uranium will be reduced 
to 3 hundred kilograms.
Iran’s “breakout time” to build 
nuclear weapons will be extended 
from two to three months to one 
year. Iran’s research and develop-
ment will make it at least 10 years 
before they can begin building a 
weapon, and the breakout time of 
one year will remain the upper limit 
of their nuclear research for the du-
ration of the deal. Fordow, Iran’s un-
derground nuclear facility, will be 
prevented from enriching uranium 
for at least 15 years.
The U.N. will have the ability to 
intrusively and aggressively inspect 
Iran’s nuclear facilities via the In-
ternational Atomic Energy Agency. 
This will almost certainly prevent 
Iran from actually creating a nuclear 
weapon anytime over the course of 
the deal. 
The mere existence of the deal 
mitigates Iran’s possibly legitimate 
claim to need nuclear weapons, 
even if Israel has threatened nuclear 
action against Iran in the past.
While Israel is openly skeptical of 
the deal and says it wants to inspect 
the nuclear facilities themselves, af-
ter this accord it seems silly for them 
to go through on their threats, con-
sidering that the international com-
munity’s response would now be 
even more devastating.
The return Iran gets, however, 
is signi?cantly more impactful. 
Since 1979, Iranians have suffered 
from terrible economic conditions, 
wreaking havoc on everything from 
food security to health care access to 
air travel. 
Iranians have been denied ad-
mission into foreign universities 
both by force (i.e. the University of 
Massachusetts’ ban on Iranian stu-
dents in its nuclear engineering pro-
gram) and by monetary restrictions 
(sending money out of the country 
is a nightmare).
Iran has millions of barrels of 
oil sitting idle rather than getting 
sold (although that might be a good 
thing, considering the impact of fos-
sil fuels). Even the anticipation of 
lifted sanctions is creating a boom in 
Iran’s stock market. 
The effects of Iranian sanctions 
went far beyond making it more 
dif?cult for Iran to increase its mili-
tary capabilities. This deal signi?es 
a light at the end of the tunnel for 
many Iranian citizens who never 
supported their government’s pos-
turing and rhetoric to begin with, 
yet still lived with the burden of 
economic sanctions that made their 
lives incredibly dif?cult.
The resistance to the deal from 
the American Right will claim that 
Iran will use the economic relief to 
further destabilize the region, part-
nering with militant groups in Hez-
bollah and the Houthis among other 
threats to democratically elected 
governments. While there are cer-
tainly problems with Iran’s regional 
af?liations, the nuclear deal will 
probably not worsen these situa-
tions. Iran is already providing sup-
port for these groups; the sanctions 
were not quite stopping them.
Furthermore, this deal creates 
a level of trust between the United 
States and Iran that has not existed 
since Operation TPAJAX installed 
the shah and the Hostage Crisis. 
This newfound diplomatic pull 
could be instrumental in pulling 
Iran to a more moderate position. 
Between this and joint airstrikes 
against ISIS, it feels like Iran might 
be open to diplomatic relations for 
the ?rst time in decades. Diplomatic 
relations will calm radicalism by giv-
ing Iran someone to answer to.
We will not know the extent of 
the provisions until the of?cial text 
is rolled out in late June. There will 
also be hurdles in both the American 
and Iranian legislative bodies. How-
ever, this deal is exciting. Relations 
with Iran are by no means perfect, 
but this deal allows their people to 
live safer and better lives without 
introducing yet another avenue to 
nuclear con?ict. 
U.S.-Iran relations have been im-
possibly strained for decades, but 
this creates a precedent for, if both 
sides ful?ll their obligations, a mid-
dle ground and mutual trust. It’s by 
no means Nixon in China, but it’s a 
powerful start.

A PERSON’S OPINION

The Tartan is feeling the urge to lay facedown in sunny ?eld of ?owers this week. So we asked,
What’s your favorite ?ower?

Devaluing humanities is harmful to CMU overall
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
The Wednesday before last I at-
tended an open town hall, the last of 
three, that the university held to dis-
cuss the 2015 Strategic Plan. I also 
had the privilege of attending a dis-
cussion on Carnegie Mellon culture 
and community at President Subra 
Suresh’s house the next day with a 
host of university administrators 
and about 35 other students.
The Strategic Plan is built on 
three main pillars: Transformative 
Teaching and Learning; Transfor-
mative Research, Creativity, Inno-
vation, and Entrepreneurship; and 
The Transformative CMU Experi-
ence. Although the details of the 
plan haven’t been ?nalized, at the 
town hall the leaders of each respec-
tive branch of the plan presented 
some of the possible strategies for 
addressing their focus.
It is refreshing to see the admin-
istration actively working to change 
the Carnegie Mellon community for 
the better. Too often the university’s 
plans focus on abstractions and 
buzzwords more than implement-
ing strategies that create tangible 
effects for the student body. 
At the town hall there were 
plenty of buzzwords — innovation, 
entrepreneurship, and metacur-
ricular, for example — but also lots 
of solid plans for action. Adminis-
trators talked about, for instance, 
the possibility to take more classes 
as pass/fail and ensuring that the 
number of units assigned to a class 
accurately re?ects the workload of 
the class.
The town hall also provided an 
open forum for students, faculty, 
and administrators to discuss the 
Strategic Plan. Although the town 
hall was not particularly well at-
tended, it is in line with Dr. Suresh’s 
emphasis on hearing the ideas of the 
student body, one of the main tenets 
of his presidency so far.
Suresh’s presidency has also fo-
cused on improving the university’s 
reputation. One thing that affects 
the university’s reputation — mea-
sured mostly by how it’s ranked — 
more than anything, Suresh says, is 
current student and alumni giving. 
The 2015 Strategic Plan aims to cre-
ate a “Transformative CMU Experi-
ence,” one that can be measured by 
how many current seniors and re-
cent alumni donate to the university.
It’s obviously frustrating when 
the university asks for more money 
when many students are already 
struggling to cover ever-increasing 
tuition costs. For me, however, it’s 
more frustrating that the university 
seems to care about some alumni 
and students more than others.
Carnegie Mellon, harkening 
back to its roots as Carnegie Tech, 
pioneering advancements in com-
puter science and arti?cial intelli-
gence in the ’60s and onwards, has 
always been a school focused on 
technology. 
When the university chose Dr. 
Suresh as its president — former di-
rector of the National Science Foun-
dation and an alumnus of the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology 
and the Indian Institute of Technol-
ogy — it was no surprise.
However, Carnegie Mellon will 
never rise to the ranks of our so-
called “peer institutions” — which, 
according to the administration 
include schools such as Harvard, 
Princeton, and Stanford — unless it 
rounds out its humanities offerings 
and stops measuring success with 
metrics that cater to students in sci-
ence, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) ?elds. 
Although all of these peer insti-
tutions boast impressive donation 
rates and even more impressive en-
dowments, they also have humani-
ties departments with reputations 
to match their STEM departments, 
something that Carnegie Mellon 
glaringly lacks. At Carnegie Mellon, 
success upon graduation is mea-
sured by salary. Departments of our 
university, from our Of?ce of Admis-
sion to our Career and Professional 
Development Center, use money as 
a benchmark of success. For many, 
Carnegie Mellon is essentially a 
pre-professional school: You major 
in chemical engineering to become 
a chemical engineer, architecture 
to become an architect, and so on. 
Carnegie Mellon’s admissions pro-
cess reinforces this by forcing pro-
spective students to choose a college 
and intended degree when they ap-
ply.
You can be undecided up to a 
point. You can, for example, know 
that you want to be an engineer, but 
not exactly which type of engineer. 
If you’re completely undecided, 
however, you’re part of Dietrich Col-
lege, which emphasizes a broad “lib-
eral arts” education but, at the same 
time, makes it dif?cult for students 
to experiment with classes across 
disciplines. The university does not 
encourage students to pursue edu-
cational passions that don’t have an 
immediate professional application.
As far as salary as a metric goes, 
Dietrich College is in relatively good 
standing. Dietrich College’s post-
graduation salary averages are high, 
but they are skewed by students in 
the college’s more interdisciplinary 
programs, like information systems 
and decision science, which tend to 
churn out high-earning employees.
While this is part of a larger, 
national discussion on the role of 
the humanities and liberal arts in 
America, it’s particularly relevant at 
Carnegie Mellon, a school founded 
“The university does not encourage students to pursue educational passions that don’t have an immediate professional application.”

Body image is part of womanhood
ANONYMOUS
Special to the Tartan
Just over two weeks ago, I saw 
the School of Drama’s production 
of Steubenville. It was insightful and 
harrowing; it toed the line between 
deeply personal and completely 
universal. It rang true for me as a 
woman and, as someone from urban 
Ohio, it felt close to home.
While the show focused on rape 
culture, it also examined body im-
age. Body image and insecurity 
aren’t limited to women, but I want 
to speak from my own experience 
because body discussions belong in 
the discourse about feminism and 
empowerment.
Last week I saw several discus-
sions online about Meghan Trainor’s 
new song, “Dear Future Husband,” 
claiming that it is sexist. I’m still on 
the fence about this; it could also be a 
satire of relationships and the power 
dynamics of gender roles, á la Taylor 
Swift’s depiction of abusive relation-
ships in “Blank Space.” Trainor’s “All 
About That Bass” from last summer 
was catchy and felt empowering, but 
some called it skinny shaming. That 
debate made me evaluate the way I 
feel, think, and talk about body size.
I am not thin. I don’t think of 
myself as fat (most days, anyway), 
but I am de?nitely not thin. I know 
that weight and health are different 
things, but I rarely feel con?dent in 
my body and I haven’t been satis-
?ed with my weight since I was 16. 
My BMI was once on the border be-
tween “normal” and “overweight,” 
but now rests at the high end of the 
“overweight” zone. (While I recog-
nize that BMI is not the most accu-
rate measure of health, doctors do 
say it gives a useful estimate.) I hate 
that weight insecurity is part of my 
identity as a woman.
Weight loss is a struggle. With 
some minor ?uctuations, I have 
maintained the same approximate 
weight for over a year and half. As 
someone with asthma, exercise is 
dif?cult. 
Because I take asthma and al-
lergy medications, weight clings to 
my body a little more tightly. Food 
habits are tricky, too. I enjoy food 
(let’s face it: carbs are delicious) and 
sometimes I use it for non-nutritional 
ends (snacking helps me stay awake 
when I’m up too late studying).
Let’s clarify something: Not all 
eating disorders make you skinny. 
Compulsive binge eating is a battle 
for me. Sometimes it’s called food 
addiction, likening it to smoking or 
alcoholism. The catch, of course, is 
that you can’t quit food.

by technical innovators and with a 
strong focus on technology that it 
can’t seem to move beyond.
The university acknowledges 
the many arguments that have been 
made for the humanities, at least 
implicitly. Last October, former Su-
preme Court Justice David Souter 
visited Carnegie Mellon to give a 
lecture full of such arguments. In his 
lecture, “The Heart of the Matter: 
The Humanities and Social Scienc-
es for a Vibrant, Competitive, and 
Secure Nation,” Souter reminded 
students that an education in the 
humanities teaches students to em-
brace multiple perspectives both 
when looking at a problem and de-
?ning a solution.
Carnegie Mellon also sponsors 
Odyssey, a Winter Break program 
in which selected sophomores learn 
to write a personal essay. Carnegie 
Mellon recognizes the signi?cance 
of education in the humanities, so 
why won’t it devote resources to im-
proving and bringing prominence to 
its offerings in Dietrich College?
The university did take a step in 
the right direction last week, when 
it announced the creation of the 
Institute for Politics and Strategy 
(IPS). The IPS, according to a uni-
versity press release, will “serve as a 
center for research, undergraduate 
and graduate education, and uni-
versity-wide initiatives in the ?elds 
of political science, international re-
lations, national security policy and 
grand strategy.” 
Initiatives like this one are en-
couraging signs that Carnegie Mel-
lon is willing to lay the groundwork 
for a future that focuses on and rec-
ognizes the signi?cance of the hu-
manities. They don’t go far enough 
to correct a 100-year-old imbalance.
The nascent Strategic Plan in-
cludes several strong points and 
proposed initiatives, from what I’ve 
seen and heard so far. If Dr. Suresh 
and the rest of the administration 
want to signi?cantly improve the 
university’s international stature, 
however, they need to focus on met-
rics past money. 
Instead of deemphasizing the 
humanities and social sciences dis-
ciplines behind a screen of STEM, 
the university should push their of-
ferings in the humanities and social 
sciences to the forefront, and devote 
the same resources given to its other 
programs to Dietrich College.
Indiana religious freedom law is worse than other RFRAs
EMMETT ELDRED
Junior Staffwriter
Indiana Governor Mike Pence 
signed the Indiana Religious Free-
dom Restoration Act (RFRA) into law 
this week. 
Critics of the bill point out that the 
RFRA gives businesses a legal defense 
to discriminate against consumers 
for religious reasons. For instance, a 
Christian caterer could refuse to cater 
a same-sex wedding, or a Christian 
coffee shop owner could deny service 
to a gay customer.
Of course, anyone can be discrimi-
nated against under this law, but LG-
BTQ people are far more likely to face 
discrimination “for religious reasons” 
than most groups of people. Consid-
ering the wave of marriage equal-
ity and tolerance sweeping through 
states like Indiana, lawmakers clearly 
feel a present need to protect discrim-
ination against LGBTQ people.
Defenders of the bill argue that it 
does not give a “license to discrimi-
nate.” Most claim that the bill is no 
different from the RFRAs of nearly 20 
other states. There’s even a federal 
RFRA, which was signed into law by 
President Clinton in 1993 with bipar-
tisan support. For liberals to support 
the RFRAs in other states and protest 
the Indiana bill, defenders say, is 
nothing but hypocrisy and politick-
ing.
They’re wrong. The Indiana bill 
is signi?cantly different from the 
RFRAs of other states, and the Indi-
ana bill gives businesses a license to 
discriminate, whereas other RFRAs 
do not.
I can understand the confusion. 
The bills have the same name! Surely 
they must be exactly the same in ev-
ery single way, right? Wrong.
I face this struggle daily. My name 
is Emmett Eldred, and my grandfa-
ther’s name is also Emmett Eldred. 
I have to remind myself all the time 
that I am not the exact same person 
as my grandfather. It gets rather ex-
istential. 
And just imagine how confusing 
it can get for other people. It seems 
like at least once a week an elderly 
stranger from Vermont sends me a 
friend request on Facebook, and I 
have to explain to them in excruci-
ating detail why I am not the person 
they are looking for.
So I understand your confusion, 
thinly veiled bigots, I really do. And 
I’m here to help. The difference be-
tween Indiana’s RFRA and other 
RFRAs is not blatant. In fact, it’s 
pretty subtle, which I think is exactly 
the problem. We all know how poorly 
homophobic people handle subtlety.
Take a look at the federal RFRA, 
the model bill for pretty much every 
other RFRA. According to Section 
2000bb, Subsection B, Item 2, the 
purpose of the federal RFRA is “to 
provide a claim or defense to per-
sons whose religious exercise is sub-
stantially burdened by government.” 
This sentiment is echoed in Section 
2000bb-1, subsection A, which says, 
“Government shall not substantially 
burden a person’s exercise of reli-
gion” except in instances of “compel-
ling government interest.”
This intent is shared by every oth-
er RFRA. The bills are designed to do 
one thing: protect citizens from the 
government infringing on their re-
ligious freedom. That’s a protection 
granted to us by the First Amend-
ment of the U.S. Constitution, so we 
don’t really need an extra law to say 
the same thing, but whatever.
To be fair, the Indiana bill does 
provide the same protection. It is 
clear throughout the text that an 
objective of the bill is to protect the 
people of Indiana from the state gov-
ernment infringing on their religious 
liberties. If that’s all the bill did, there 
would be no controversy. But that’s 
not all the bill does.
According the Section 9 of the In-
diana RFRA, a person or business can 
use the religious freedom defense in 
court “regardless of whether the state 
or any other governmental entity is 
a party to the proceeding.” In other 
words, this bill doesn’t just apply to 
instances in which the government 
impedes religious freedom, it applies 
to any instance in which interacting 
with any person impedes religious 
freedom.
Neither the Federal RFRA nor any 
of the other state RFRAs include simi-
lar language. So when people protest 
the law, they are not being hypocriti-
cal, the laws are genuinely different 
in a substantial way. And that differ-
ence does give businesses the “license 
to discriminate,” as long as they can 
argue that they are adhering to their 
religious beliefs.
So how do we ?x this? The Indi-
ana State Legislature must remove 
section 9 from the bill, clarify in the 
bill that it does not give businesses a 
license to discriminate, and expand 
their nondiscrimination laws to pro-
tect LGBTQ people.
Governor Mike Pence has said re-
peatedly that Hoosiers are good, and 
decent people who would never dis-
criminate against anyone. This may 
be true on the whole, but there will 
always be people ?lled with hate. A 
feel-good statement about the de-
cency of your state is no excuse to not 
protect people from discrimination.
If Hoosiers truly are good, decent 
people, then they should have no 
problem with laws protecting fellow 
Indiana citizens from discrimination. 
It’s a shame, then, that Gov. Pence 
has for decades been consistent in 
opposing nondiscrimination laws 
protecting LGBTQ people.
SENATE, from A9Certainly, all eating disorders are 
dangerous. Anorexia and bulimia are 
devastating. Binge-eating disorder 
differs in its effects, but has similar 
roots. Food is accompanied by guilt, 
stress, and shame, which perpetuate 
in a cycle. 
Given the choice between an eat-
ing disorder that makes you fat and 
one that makes you skinny, who 
would prefer the former? Maybe it’s 
?ippant to ask. Our consumer cul-
ture certainly tells us the latter.
For a long time I thought weight 
and restraint had to do with will-
power. I engaged in skinny shaming 
before I even knew the words for it. 
The truth is that eating disorders are 
connected to mental health, not self-
control.
 And not all weight gain comes 
from eating disorders: accessibil-
ity, socioeconomics, and underly-
ing health issues (both physical and 
mental) all play a role. 
Still, fatness is associated with la-
ziness, sloppiness, and poor self-con-
trol. Rooted in objecti?cation and 
internalized misogyny, the stigma 
perseveres.
Lots of people are naturally skin-
ny. As a naturally chubby person, I 
often cannot help feeling resentful 
of them. I ?nd myself looking at thin 
women knowing that, even if I lost 
the excess weight, my rib cage would 
still be built larger.
The body positivity movement 
has made strides toward eliminating 
both “fatphobia” and skinny sham-
ing by emphasizing natural differ-
ences in body shape. But while the 
media represents variations in thin 
bodies — curvy, wiry, lean, etc. — 
there continues to be little variation 
in the representation of overweight 
women.
Thin women aren’t marginalized 
in the way overweight women are. In 
advertising, thin women are aspira-
tional representations of ourselves. 
In consumer culture, clothes are 
made to ?t thin women; larger sizes 
are typically enlarged versions of 
smaller sizes, and don’t account for 
the way garments ?t on differently 
sized bodies.
I won’t pretend to understand 
how thin women feel when they’re 
called “too skinny” or “anorexic-
looking.” Skinny shaming oversim-
pli?es reality for thin women. Many 
women work hard to stay in shape. 
Others struggle to put on weight. We 
shouldn’t discount these challenges, 
but it’s dif?cult for me to maintain 
that outlook when I’m jealous of 
someone’s thin privilege.
Thin people can struggle with 
their bodies too, but their privilege 
comes from judging their bodies by 
their own standards. To borrow a 
metaphor from Everyday Feminism, 
no one else is offended by their 
beach body. Meanwhile, society sets 
the standards for overweight peo-
ple’s bodies. People on the beach do 
take offense.
The discussion of privilege brings 
me back to Steubenville. Rape cul-
ture links bodies to sexuality and 
objecti?cation, and one of the most 
conspicuous signs of modern rape 
culture is catcalling.
 In the show, a woman talked 
about being catcalled when she runs, 
and said that it has only happened 
since she lost weight.
This makes a connection between 
objecti?cation and attractiveness. 
She explained the paradox of wish-
ing she heard catcalling before and 
hating that she hears it now. Rape 
culture does that to us; it perpetu-
ates an image of what we should 
want that differs from what we 
actually feel. 
In reality, catcalling isn’t related 
to attraction. Catcallers seek to ob-
jectify, making their victims feel 
threatened and insecure. I’ve heard 
women say it feels like a compliment, 
but I don’t think it’s empowering. In 
particular, when a fat woman is cat-
called, there is an additional implica-
tion of mockery.
I don’t often wear makeup, but I 
try to put thought into my appear-
ance. Some days are more effort-
ful than others. No sleep and a long 
day of classes? Oversized sweater it 
is. Yet I feel self-conscious on these 
days. 
Overweight people are stigma-
tized to be sloppy and lazy. A thin 
woman in the same out?t looks like a 
hipster, but I look like a mess. Is this 
my own perception? Am I contribut-
ing to the stigma by feeling this way? 
I hope not, but I fear otherwise.
Is the solution to learn to love my 
body? That seems a little thought-
less. Contrary to comic ?lm portray-
als (Bridesmaids, Hairspray, Pitch 
Perfect), con?dence isn’t a catch-all 
solution for overweight women. I’m 
happy for those who embrace their 
bodies, but not everyone feels that 
way.
The media also tends to represent 
two extremes: clearly overweight or 
conventionally thin women. Medi-
um-sized or chubby women aren’t 
shown much. 
I like Mindy Kaling’s comments 
about being “average American 
woman-sized.” I’m probably closer to 
her size and shape than anyone else 
I’ve seen on television.
Will I continue to try to lose 
weight? Yes. While I wish I felt more 
body-positive, I still feel body-inse-
cure. Ideally, feeling good about my 
body would be independent of my 
weight. I’m just not there yet.

Pair of epic Final Four clashes set Wisconsin-Duke ?nal
NISHANT REINWAL
Staffwriter
The Final Four of the Na-
tional College Athletic Associ-
ation (NCAA) Division 1 Men’s 
Basketball Championship is 
over, and with it the Kentucky 
Wildcats’ 38-game unbeaten 
streak for the season. Let’s re-
cap the two semi?nal games 
before looking at the ?nal 
game of March Madness 2015.
Duke Blue Devils vs 
Michigan State Spartans 
(81 – 61)
There was a consensus that 
the brilliant offense of Duke, 
provided largely by ?rst-year 
stars Jahlil Okafor and Jus-
tise Winslow, would face a 
tough test in Coach Tom Izzo’s 
Spartans, but eventually pull 
through. What we saw was 
a repeat of the defensive in-
tensity shown in the Regional 
?nal against the Gonzaga Bull-
dogs, where Duke’s perimeter 
players harassed Michigan 
State players as soon as they 
stepped into the half court to 
severely limit the Spartan of-
fense. Winslow was especially 
impressive as opponents shot 
1–7 with him as primary de-
fender in the ?rst half as Duke 
built their lead. Okafor did 
his usual work on the block 
as he used his massive size to 
his advantage over smaller de-
fenders to score easy buckets. 
There was too much ?repower 
in this Duke team for Michi-
gan State to stand a chance, as 
shown by the emotion in the 
players after ?rst-year guard 
Grayson Allen threw down a 
huge dunk off his own missed 
three-point shot in the second 
half and role players like cen-
ter Marshall Plumlee stepped 
up to ensure the lead was 
not reduced against reserves. 
The end result was an easy 
20-point victory for Coach 
Mike Krzyzewski’s team as he 
gets a shot at his ?fth national 
title and the ?rst since 2010.
Wisconsin Badgers vs 
Kentucky Wildcats 
(71 – 64)
The entire nation was wait-
ing to watch this game, a re-
match of last year’s thrilling 
semi?nal.
There were several story-
lines that were spoken of be-
fore the beginning. Bo Ryan 
and John Calipari go head-
to-head in a matchup of two 
of the best coaches in basket-
ball right now and as ?nalists 
for the Hall of Fame this year. 
No one has been able to stop 
Wisconsin senior center Frank 
Kaminsky this season, but he 
hadn’t faced defenders like 
junior forward/center Wil-
lie Cauley-Stein and ?rst-year 
forward Karl-Anthony Towns 
yet. Wisconsin junior forward 
Sam Dekker had shot lights 
out in the tournament till 
now, but no one knew how he 
would fare against the length 
of another mid ?rst round pro-
jection in ?rst-year forward 
Trey Lyles.
These two teams combined 
are expected to have 6 play-
ers going in the ?rst round of 
the NBA draft. Players’ draft 
stocks depended on this game.
The ?ow of the game wemt 
largely as predicted as each 
team made their runs and 
took brief leads before the 
other came storming back 
to level it up or take the lead 
themselves. The sti?ing Ken-
tucky defense looked lost at 
times against the extremely 
well-spaced Badgers offense 
with no one in their star front 
court rotation able to handle 
Kaminsky down low or at the 
three-point arc. Kentucky was 
shooting above 60 percent for 
most of the game, though, so 
they were able to keep up with 
the quick scoring of the Wis-
consin offense to whom they 
were surrendering a lot of of-
fensive rebounds and second 
chance points.
The dominant play of Ken-
tucky began to show up and 
they were leading 60–56 and 
in control of the game with 
only a few minutes remaining. 
Wisconsin turned the tables 
though, turning up defensive-
ly with Kaminsky and Dekker 
playing their part in limiting 
Kentucky’s several options. 
Sophomore guard Aaron Har-
rison air-balled a three with 
the Badgers leading 68–64 
with less than 10 seconds re-
maining and Wisconsin iced 
the game at the free throw 
line as they became the ?rst 
team to beat the Wildcats this 
season.
Wisconsin Badgers vs 
Duke Blue Devils
Monday Night
In a matchup of what are 
probably the two best offen-
sive teams in college basket-
ball, the difference will come 
down to who has the better 
defense on the day. For a large 
part of the season, most view-
ers assumed that Wisconsin is 
better there and would pos-
sess the advantage in this 
matchup, but the last two 
games have shown that Duke 
can really step up their  defen-
sive intensity when required. 
The most fascinating battle 
will be between the two of the 
NCAA’s best centers in Okafor 
and Kaminsky. One of the big-
gest reasons Kaminsky came 
back to Wisconsin after last 
season was to prove that he 
could win a title for the Bad-
gers and Bo Ryan. To do that 
he will not only have to score 
for his team, but also work tire-
lessly to defend the dominant 
Okafor. Okafor has not seen a 
match for him yet this season 
and the nation was hoping to 
see him take on Cauley-Stein 
or Towns, but Kaminsky is a 
formidable opponent. Okafor 
will also struggle defensively 
as he tries to chase Kaminsky 
and sophomore forward Nigel 
Hayes around the perimeter 
from where they are both ex-
cellent shooters. Wisconsin 
has a huge size advantage over 
Duke, but the Blue Devils’ ag-
gressive trapping scheme has 
proved to be very effective in 
pressuring teams into taking 
bad shots or turning the ball 
over.
Another battle scouts are 
salivating over is the clash of 
Dekker and Winslow. Both 
have overshadowed their 
star centers this tournament 
as they have shot lights out 
from deep and, in Winslow’s 
case, been extremely good 
on defense as well. Dekker 
could increase his draft stock 
with a strong showing against 
probably the best wing in the 
current draft class, whereas 
Winslow is already being pro-
jected to be a pick in the 5-8 
range after the Towns, Okafor, 
point guard Emmanuel Mu-
diay and Ohio State freshman 
point guard D’Angelo Russell 
quartet. Their contributions 
on both ends of the court will 
be vital if their team is to win 
the championship.
Finally, it all comes down 
to last clash, which is between 
two legendary coaches in Wis-
consin’s Bo Ryan and Team 
USA and longtime Duke coach 
Mike Krzyzewski.
Coach K has reached this 
stage eight times before and 
won it four times. He is widely 
known as one of the best col-
lege coaches of all time. Ryan 
has shown he is no slouch as 
he’s already outwitted a coach 
of Kentucky’s John Calipari’s 
caliber to get here. As Wiscon-
sin guns for it ?rst title in 74 
years, Coach K and the Blue 
Devils will try to ensure they 
have to wait at least one more 
year.
Women’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon Wom-
en’s golf team took fourth 
place at the Purple and White 
Invitational over the weekend 
with a score of 738.
After a day-low 77 during 
the second round of the tour-
nament, ?rst-year Robin Tan 
followed up on a 91 during 
day one to tie for the best score 
at the tournament.
First-years Summer Ki-
tahara and Emma Hoskins 
were tied for the lead after day 
one, each shooting an 85. Day 
one included a 101 from ?rst-
year Isabelle Tseng and a 105 
from ?rst-year Ginger Glass. 
Day two brought a 101 from 
Hoskins, a 98 from Tseng, and 
a 100 from Glass. Kitahara did 
not play the second day of the 
tournament.
As an individual, junior 
Yoon Hee Ha shot a 106 on day 
one and a 99 on day two for a 
205 score for the overall tour-
nament.
The team continues com-
petition next weekend at the 
Westminster College spring 
invitational.
Women’s Tennis
The sixth-ranked Tartans 
moved to 12–5 on the season 
after an 8–1 victory over No. 
20 University of Mary Wash-
ington.
The Tartans swept doubles 
competition with the team of 
senior Bryn Raschke and ?rst-
year Cori Sidell, the team of 
sophomore Vanessa Pavia and 
?rst-year Stacey Chang, and 
the team of sophomore Nich-
olle Torres and junior Brooke 
Tsu winning 8–5, 8–3, and 8–1 
respectively.
In singles play, Pavia took 
her match at the start of 
singles play 6–0, 6–1. In the 
second spot, senior Angela 
Pratt won her match 4–6, 6–2, 
1–0. In the third spot, Torres 
won 2–6, 6–1, 6–1. Tsu took 
her match in a tiebreaker 7–6 
(9–7), 6–2. Sidell suffered the 
Tartans’ only defeat of the day, 
dropping her match 7–5, 6–2. 
Raschke rounded out singles 
competition with a 4–6, 6–1, 
1–0 (10–7) victory.
The Tartans continue their 
season Thursday at University 
Athletic Association Champi-
onships.
Men’s Tennis
The No. 9 Tartans defeated 
No. 12 Case Western Reserve 
University 6–3 to move to 
13–5 for the season.
Seniors Will Duncan and 
Christian Heaney-Secord se-
cured the only Tartan’s victory 
in doubles play with an 8–6 
win. Sophomore team Jack 
Kasbeer and Kenny Zheng 
as well as the team of senior 
Bryce Beisswanger and junior 
Yuvraj Kumar both dropped 
8–6.
The Tartans took ?ve of 
six singles matches. Junior 
Abhishek Alla won 6–2, 6–3, 
while Heaney-Secord took the 
Tartans’ sole hit in singles play, 
dropping 6–1, 6–4. Duncan 
recovered, however, winning 
his match 7–6, 6–2. Zheng 
won his match 6–1, 6–4. Soph-
omore Kunal Wadwani picked 
up his match in three sets, 
winning 6–1, 2–6, 6–0. Sopho-
more Kiril Kirkov lost a ?rst set 
before recovering to win his 
match as well, 5–7, 6–4, 6–3.
The men’s tennis team also 
competed on Sunday. The 
Tartans continue their season 
Saturday against Mary Wash-
ington.

CMU Track and Field puts up big numbers in Quad Meet
ANDY BIRLA
Staffwriter
It seems quite ?tting that 
after a week of dismal weath-
er, the sun rises on our ath-
letes as they go out to shine 
in the 2015 Quad meet featur-
ing athletes from four schools 
(Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity: Behrend; Westminster 
University; Carnegie Mellon 
University; and Washington 
and Jefferson University).
The ?rst major event of the 
day was Men’s Javelin Throw 
and while — for the most part 
— the only challenge seemed 
to be following the javelin as 
it went into the sun, the wind 
(traces of Pittsburgh’s harsh 
winter) caused many foul 
throws. The event was cer-
tainly not lacking in intensity 
or competition however, with 
each thrower putting it all on 
the line — creating an atmo-
sphere that would carry on for 
the rest of the meet. In the end 
however, it was a competitor 
from Penn St. that stole the 
day with a throw spanning a 
whopping 60.25m. Carnegie 
Mellon’s best performances 
came from sophomore David 
Ott (5th place with 44.72m) 
and ?rst-year Jacob Schofel 
(6th place with 44.67m).
Next up was Men’s Long 
Jump, which saw a Westmin-
ster competitor jump a jaw-
dropping 6.33m to achieve 
?rst place. Carnegie Mellon 
sophomore Donald Boyer and 
?rst-year Andrew Lee were not 
far behind placing third and 
forth place respectively with 
jumps of 6.24m and 6.12m 
apiece. Men’s Shot Put again 
saw Penn St. place ?rst with 
an astonishing throw rang-
ing 14.55m. Carnegie Mellon 
?rst-year David Trzcinski held 
his own, placing third with a 
throw distane of 12.73m.
Penn St. dominance in the 
throwing events carried over 
to Men’s Pole Vault as a com-
petitor stunned the crowd 
with a leap of 4.33m. With 
the exception of Westminster 
junior bagging second place 
with a jump of 4.18m, the men 
from Penn St. nearly ?lled the 
table, leaving Carnegie Mel-
lon sophomore Kyle Weaver 
at sixth place with a jump of 
3.58m.
The men from Carnegie 
Mellon, however, were far 
from done and they came back 
with a terri?c performance 
from all their athletes in Men’s 
Hammer Throw with all their 
competitors nearly ?lling the 
rankings. Schofel came into 
his own with a stellar throw of 
44.96m. Junior Paul Hamerski 
placed a solid second with his 
distance of 39.04m. Also per-
forming well during the event 
from Carnegie Mellon were 
sophomore David Ott, Trz-
cinski and sophomore Jacob 
Brooks.
The Men’s 3000 Meter 
Steeplechase held the bar set 
in the Men’s Hammer Throw 
as Carnegie Mellon held on 
to the ?rst and second places 
with great performances from 
sophomore Curtis Watro and 
senior Elliot Watson, notching 
times of 9:54.58 and 9:58.65, 
respectively.
The Men’s 100-Meter Dash 
is always one of the most an-
ticipated events at an athletic 
meet and it certainly did not 
disappoint today. Despite 
?erce competition and crip-
pling pressure, a Westminster 
competitor placed ?rst with a 
time of 11.23 seconds to cap 
a breathtaking performance. 
Sophomore Matthew Sheh’s 
time of 11.87 seconds put him 
in sixth place, which should be 
a clear indicator of the differ-
ence between the competitors 
and the thrilling the perfor-
mance.
There were few events at 
the meet that saw more prepa-
ration go into them than the 
Women’s Pole Vault. Every-
thing from the tension among 
the competitors to the vehe-
mence of their practice rou-
tines set the tone for a truly 
spectacular contest. While 
each woman pushed herself to 
the limit in the event itself, all 
of them aiming for perfection, 
it was a sophomore from West-
minster that stole the show 
with a remarkable leap of 
3.43m that simply left her un-
touchable by the opposition. 
Carnegie Mellon did maintain 
a presence in the event, with 
sophomore Grace Yee notch-
ing a 2.98m leap to put her 
into fourth place.
Carnegie Mellon headlined 
the Women’s Long Jump, 
capturing both the ?rst and 
second places. Senior Sasha 
Spalding thrilled the crowd 
with a jump of 5.23m, putting 
her far ahead of her competi-
tors. First-year Luise Bering 
put forward an impressive per-
formance as well with a jump 
of 4.77m.
Spalding continued to hold 
the Carnegie Mellon banner 
high in the Women’s Shot Put 
as well, notching a throw of 
11.09m that was well ahead 
of second place which was 
awarded to a throw of 10.66m. 
Spalding placed second in the 
Women’s 100m Dash with a 
time of 13.24 seconds, making 
her an athlete unlike any other 
with excellent placements in 
throws, jumps, and runs.
The Women’s 800-Meter 
Run saw the true capability 
of Carnegie Mellon’s women’s 
athletics as the Tartans occu-
pied 8 of the top 12 positions. 
Junior Erin Kiekhaefer head-
lined the performance with an 
awe-inspiring time of 2:18.87 
followed swiftly by ?rst-year 
Sarah Cook with a time of 
2:19.32.
The women from Carn-
egie Mellon were leaps and 
bounds ahead of the compe-
tition, tallying a formidable 
191 points with Westminster 
coming in second with 124 
points followed by Washing-
ton and Jefferson (94 points) 
and Penn St. (82 points). The 
Carnegie Mellon men’s team 
(200 points) fell by a mea-
sly 12 points to Penn St. (212 
points). Westminster came in 
third with 144 points followed 
by Washington and Jefferson’s 
36 points.
Ultimately, however, the 
brilliantly balanced perfor-
mance from Carnegie Mellon 
(owing to the dedication and 
practice of its athletes) stole 
the show as the combined 
standings put Carnegie Mel-
lon at the top with a whop-
ping 391 points followed by 
PSU Behrend (294 points), 
Westminster (268 points) and 
Washington and Jefferson 
(130 points).
Club Baseball gets ready to start spring half of season
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
With a 5–1 conference re-
cord — including a sweep of 
conference power West Vir-
ginia University (WVU) to 
?nish the fall season — the 
Carnegie Mellon Club Base-
ball team is poised to grab 
the Tartans’ ?rst-ever District 
title.
The series with WVU 
brought no shortage of ex-
citement. The ?rst two games 
featured offensive explosions 
from the Tartans, who scored 
25 runs in a pair of big wins. 
Junior civil  and environmen-
tal engineering major Darren 
Kerfoot, who had pitched 
?ve innings in the game one 
victory, was called upon to 
close out game three. With 
the Tartans ahead by one and 
runners on second and third 
base with one out, Kerfoot re-
corded consecutive strikeouts 
to seal the game and hand the 
Tartans the 7–6 victory.
The wins have put Carn-
egie Mellon in the driver’s 
seat heading into the spring 
portion of the season. Despite 
pitching injuries leaving the 
Tartans with a 2–2 record at 
their spring break tourna-
ment, the team expects more 
results like those WVU games 
for the rest of the season.
The team works hard de-
spite limited practice time and 
makes a point of not getting 
tied up in how other teams are 
playing in order to focus on 
their own game. “[The team 
plays] really hard, just need 
to stick to that,” Kerfoot said.
The team’s active recruit-
ment has made Carnegie 
Mellon baseball more visible, 
which has led to a wider tal-
ent pool and very strong team 
this season.
The team will need it to 
achieve the farthest of their 
goals. According to Kerfoot, 
this year’s National Club Base-
ball Association World Series 
is in Pittsburg, Kan., which 
would make representatives 
from Pittsburgh, Penn.. feel 
right at home. While the Tar-
tans have a long road ahead 
of them before they set their 
sights that far ahead, a con-
ference lead is a good place to 
start.
With a three game set 
against California University 
of Pennsylvania (CUP) ap-
proaching, the Tartans can 
soon get themselves back on 
the path to the conference 
title.
The team has one other 
important goal, off the dia-
mond. Carnegie Mellon is 
currently the only school in 
the UAA without a varsity 
baseball team. In his ?rst in-
terview with The Tartan, 
Kerfoot was quoted as say-
ing “I also really hope to get 
Carnegie Mellon baseball to 
become an NCAA sport before 
I graduate,” and the team is 
quite close to achieving that 
feat. There are several impor-
tant factors to consider, but 
each key requirement for a 
varsity team is reachable. The 
athletics department wants a 
varsity baseball team, so the 
Carnegie Mellon club has lots 
of support in their quest to be-
come varsity. There are sever-
al high schools with baseball 
?elds close enough that Carn-
egie Mellon will have a home 
?eld within driving distance 
required by NCAA. There are 
several available indoor prac-
tice facilities, so the Carnegie 
Mellon team will be able to 
practice baseball year round 
and remain competitive. Fi-
nally, the available facilities 
will likely make it possible 
to recruit a women’s softball 
team, creating even more 
opportunities for varsity ath-
letics on campus. However, 
the main hurdle is gathering 
support from local communi-
ties. “Our biggest challenge 
is getting people to know us 
and respect us,” Kerfoot said, 
“and all that will come from 
winning.”
This team has put up no 
shortage of wins recently and 
will likely be a varsity team in 
the coming years.
Due to several cancella-
tions, the team will resume 
conference play for the spring 
this weekend with their 
matchup against CUP.
Summer Kitahara takes home Rookie of the Month
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
As she gazes down the fair-
way, ?rst-year golfer Summer 
Kitahara knows that she is in a 
world of her own: just her, her 
club, and a golf ball. And yet, 
the computer science major is 
aware that her team is count-
ing on her to play her role, an 
particularly prominent one 
due to the structure of the 
Tartans’ women’s golf team.
To say that the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s golf team 
is unusual in its structure is 
quite an understatement. All 
but one member of the team 
are ?rst-years, and junior me-
chanical engineering major 
Yoon Hee Ha spent the fall 
semester studying abroad. 
In addition, the fall semes-
ter marked the ?rst time the 
women’s golf team would be 
competing at the varsity level, 
having previously competed 
at the club sports level. Jump-
ing up to the next competi-
tive level would be tough for 
experienced teams, let alone 
a group of ?rst-year students 
entering uncharted territory 
along with new Head Coach 
Dan Rodgers and Assistant 
Coach Nick Dunn.
Kitahara, however, con-
tends that these circumstanc-
es have produced remarkable 
team chemistry. “We bonded 
really well in the fall because 
we were really new to the col-
lege lifestyle,” Kitahara said. 
“We were learning to balance 
tournaments and homework.” 
This is certainly no easy feat, 
considering the rigor of cours-
es everyone on the team had. 
Yet, throughout the course of 
the year, the team has played 
very well against their compe-
tition, with Kitahara leading 
the way with an average of 
80.3 strokes per round.
Kitahara considers herself 
well-prepared for her role as 
one of the team’s leaders both 
on and off the golf course. 
Having come from a house-
hold with a strong focus on 
extracurricular activities, Ki-
tahara often participated in 
swimming, tennis, and golf, 
becoming more serious in golf 
as she approached her high 
school years. She emerged as 
the number 1 player for her 
high school during her junior 
and senior years, and she 
wanted to participate in golf 
going into college. The most 
important thing to her was 
academic rigor, leading her to 
Carnegie Mellon.
While the team’s ?rst tour-
nament of the year at West-
minster resulted in a very 
respectable second place ?n-
ish, Kitahara feels that the 
team’s performance at Grove 
City three days later really 
cemented their place in the 
competitive scene. Despite 
the presence of some expe-
rienced Division II teams in 
the tournament, the Tartans 
ended up ?nishing in ?rst. “It 
was a big boost of con?dence 
and made us feel like more of 
a team,” she said. From there, 
the Tartans capitalized on 
their momentum, taking ?rst 
place at both Thiel College 
and Saint Vincent College 
over the course of the next 
week.
During Spring Break, Ki-
tahara accomplished her 
proudest performance yet: 
?nishing in the top ?ve at the 
University Athletics Associa-
tion (UAA) Championships in 
Sorrento, Florida. “Going 
down to Florida, the competi-
tion was a lot larger than what 
we normally have here,” she 
said. Despite the initial intimi-
dation of the competition, Ki-
tahara was motivated to out-
class her competitors. With 
scores of 80 and 81 over her 
two rounds, she was named 
part of the All-UAA ?rst team 
and Division III Eastern Col-
legiate Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) Women’s Rookie 
Golfer of the Month.
For Kitahara, her feats off 
the golf course remain more 
important to her than her al-
ready impressive showings 
on the course. “Overcoming 
challenges like ?nding the 
answer to a 251 problem are 
even more rewarding,” she 
said. The competitive drive 
she shows in golf is height-
ened when it comes to the 
academic challenges she faces 
regularly. “I’ve learned not to 
give up. It’s really rewarding 
when you ?nally solve those 
problems.”
Nevertheless, she knows 
that she will be continuing to 
play golf as she progresses at 
Carnegie Mellon. “It’s an im-
portant part of my life, and I 
won’t be letting it go anytime 
soon.”

Mississippi Mud Cake
Deliciously sweet recipe from the Grandma Sue archive
April 1 came and went this week. To most, it 
means April Fools’ Day, a day to screw with your 
friends and have fun. But for me, it means my 
Grandma’s Sue’s birthday. She would have turned 
66 this year. I’m still not very good at talking 
about how much I miss her. So instead, I want to 
celebrate her the best way I know how: a cake.
I’ll forever associate this cake with Grandma 
Sue. It was one of her favorites, and for a good 
reason. It is delicious and it’s her recipe. When 
she passed away, her recipe card got added to 
my mom’s book, and we’ve been making it for 
as many occasions as possible ever since. The 
bottom layer is a rich chocolate pecan cake. Then 
as soon as that comes out of the oven, it gets a 
generous spread of marshmallow fluff, which just 
melts into the warm cake. And finally on top is 
some of the sweetest chocolate frosting you’ll 
ever taste.
I wish she could be here today to eat cake with 
me and see that I’ve grown out of my moody-boy-
crazy-glued-to-my-phone teenager phase. But 
since that’s just not how life works, I’d just like 
to say “cheers” to her, wherever she is out there, 
and hope that she’s proud of me.
Cake
2 sticks of margarine, room temperature
1½ cups of flour
2 cups of sugar
4 eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla
3 tablespoons of cocoa powder
1½ cups of pecans
Toppings
7 ounce jar of marshmallow fluff
1 stick of margarine
4 cups of powdered sugar
1/3 cup of cocoa powder
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
¼ cup of water
Directions
There are some parts of this recipe that I would 
change if it weren’t the treasured family recipe 
that it is. For example, in my kitchen, margarine 
over butter is a sin. I would probably also 
substitute whole milk for water in the frosting 
because the more fat the better! I also wouldn’t 
include the specifications about glass versus 
metal pans because this is college and I use the 
foil pans you can buy at the grocery store. Those 
with less emotional attachment to the authentic 
version of the recipe can feel free to make those 
changes!
First of all, preheat your oven to 300 degrees 
if your pan is metal, or 285 if it’s glass (either 
way, it should be 9x13). Then mix together 
the margarine, flour, sugar and eggs for about 
a minute until they’re all smooth. Then add 
everything else. So fast and so easy! Spread the 
batter out into the pan and let it bake for about 
45 minutes. As soon as it comes out of the oven, 
cover the whole top with marshmallow fluff. The 
combination of hot cake and sticky marshmallow 
will most likely pull up the top of the cake and 
make the fluff layer all full of crumbs. Just keep 
spreading! The frosting will cover it up and it 
won’t make a difference.
Let the cake cool completely, and try to resist 
putting your face directly into the melting fluff. 
To keep yourself distracted, start to make the 
frosting. Begin by creaming the margarine. Mix 
it until it’s shiny and smooth. Start pouring in 
powdered sugar a little bit at a time, adding 
water when it gets too thick. After all the sugar 
and water have been mixed, add the cocoa 
powder and vanilla. Keep whipping it for a little 
longer so it can achieve maximum fluff. You owe 
the frosting the opportunity to be its best self. 
Finally, spread the finished product over the 
cooled fluff and cake, and that’s it!
A final warning: This cake isn’t for the weak. It’s 
probably the sweetest and richest dessert you’ll 
ever eat. My dad once said “I’d love to have it 
every week but it would kill me.” However, it’s 
exactly what you need if you’re a chocoholic, a 
dessert-fiend, or complete hedonist.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
Have you ever eaten the 
vegetable fritters from 
the Tartan Express truck? 
They’re offered as a side 
for the mediocre noodle 
dishes and slightly more 
mediocre rice bowls, but 
they’re far more delicious 
than any of the truck’s 
main dishes. I’ve been 
eating there every day for 
dinner, and I dump the 
bowls in favor of the two 
deep-fried, heavenly balls 
that come with them. 
Now I’m running out of 
money. My budget can’t 
take much more of the 
amount of money I’m 
spending buying dinners 
for the side dish. But I’ve 
been eating vegetable 
fritters for dinner for so 
long, now, that I feel like 
I need to subsist on them 
to survive. I’m addicted.
I’m seriously considering 
staking out the truck, and 
stealing all the fritters 
when they close shop at 
the end of the day. 
How can I combat this 
addiction?

Dear FRICASSEED 
FRITTER,
Everyone seems to be 
writing in about food or 
restaurants lately. I wonder 
why that is?
I personally see no problem 
with hijacking the Tartan 
Truck and driving it as far 
as it can take you, starting 
your own cross-country 
ramen business, selling 
your wares for paltry prices 
to the good, hard-working 
Americans that don’t have 
the luxury of even mediocre-
quality Asianic noodle and 
rice dishes, who have gone 
through their unhappy years 
of nine-to-fives from the 
moment they graduated (or 
didn’t graduate) high school 
without having ever seen, let 
alone tasted, an egg roll.
You would be an American 
hero. And, of course, you’d 
keep the vegetable fritters to 
yourself.
But if you really want to kick 
the fritter habit, you’ll have 
to find something equally as 
enticing. If you want to stick 
to campus eateries (although 
I’ve no idea why you would), 
I suggest eating at the hot 
dog stand for lunch daily — 
best dogs in the immediate 
area. If you’d rather stick 
to vegetarian, you should 
... well, no, there’s nothing, 
really.
Or get off the meal plan 
and use all the money 
you save to buy your own 
food truck,
Evan Kahn

The long-awaited public bashing of teen heartthrob 
and hairstyle trendsetter Justin Bieber ?nally aired 
on Monday. Comedy Central has aired 14 total roasts, 
including this most recent one, since it ?rst started 
the Comedy Central Roast in 2003. The idea of a 
“roast,” of course, has been around longer than this 
particular television event, but Comedy Central’s 
roasts are the biggest and most spectacular roasts in 
existence. Justin Bieber is the youngest “roastee” to 
ever participate in the show, having just turned 21 
in mid-March. The evening of insults, which can be 
viewed on the channel’s website, are sure to make 
viewers laugh uncontrollably and feel like terrible 
human beings at the same time. But the roast also 
was surprisingly thought provoking, begging the 
question of “What is the role of comedy in society?” 
and what that says about what people ?nd funny.
The Bieber roast was seen by 4.4 million viewers, 
viewers who are presumably fascinated and frustrated 
by Bieber’s antics. As current college students 
represent the age group that grew up with Bieber, 
they have been close witnesses to Bieber’s rise and 
fall. Pete Davidson, the youngest cast member on 
Saturday Night Live and one of the roasters present 
Monday evening, even called Bieber out on being 
such a successful and wonderful member of “our 
generation.”
Other roasters present included Snoop Dogg — yes, 
he’s back to Dogg from Lion — Ludacris, Martha 
Stewart, Hannibal Buress, Natasha Leggero, Shaquille 
O’Neal, Jeff Ross, and Chris D’Elia. Kevin Hart served 
as an unbelievably funny roast master. Just seeing 
Hart and O’Neal playfully tussle with each other made 
the entire show worth it.
Davidson presented one of the most interesting and 
hilarious roasts of the evening. Much of a roaster’s job 
is to try to thoroughly destroy other roasters sitting 
on stage with carefully rehearsed punchlines, before 
roasting the roastee himself. Some of these jokes are 
offensive in such a way that they push comedy farther 
than audiences are used to, and some are insensitive 
and clearly hurt their targets.
During the roast of Charlie Sheen, comedian Amy 
Schumer famously angered Jackass star Steve-O by 
mentioning the death of his fellow castmate and friend 
Ryan Dunn, which had occurred just a few weeks 
earlier. Davidson drew gasps from members of the live 
audience when he talked about his father, who died in 
the attacks on 9/11. He said to Bieber, “I lost my dad 
on 9/11, and I always regretted growing up without a 
dad. Until I met your dad, Justin. Now I’m glad mine’s 
dead.” There were audible groans and a smattering 
of slow applause from the audience, who did not 
know how to react. That was the ?rst of a couple 
9/11-themed jokes, and the ?rst of many jokes during 
which the audience winced.
Various jokes were said throughout the evening 
that visibly upset the roasters. Hart did not seem to 
approve of any of the ISIS jokes used, and Ludacris did 
not seem to appreciate a joke that made fun of his role 
as a father. Both of their reactions are understandable, 
but it does raise a few questions: What is the role 
of comedy in our society? How does humor impact 
the way we view what’s important? Is comedy a 
useful tool in combatting societal problems, or does it 
exacerbate them?
A recurring theme throughout the two-hour episode 
was the way that the female participants onstage 
were routinely made fun of. Instead of making fun 
of career, appearance, family, past life experiences, 
or even race, most jokes directed toward the female 
roasters almost exclusively made fun of their sex 
lives. While these jokes were funny, they begged the 
question of what is considered funny in this country. 
Comedians who routinely deliver jokes that walk the 
line between funny and offensive often talk about 
comedy as a great tool to talk about dif?cult subjects. 
Comedy can also be used to help people heal and get 
audiences to think about tragedy, while at the same 
time allow them to emotionally compartmentalize.
This ability makes comedy’s role in this country 
dif?cult to understand. In terms of Justin Bieber’s 
roast, the network apparently cut out a joke delivered 
by Jeff Ross about the late Paul Walker, so occasionally 
comedy is truly censored. However, while comedy is 
great when it comes to joking about dif?cult issues, 
is it possible that comedy can play a role in the 
development of society and progress toward a more 
equal and just future? When these questions are put in 
the context of the roast, the answer is simple: Comedy 
can play a role that furthers equality, but a Comedy 
Central Roast is not the place where that happens.

American Idol still has an upper hand over The Voice
Competitive singing shows churn out fewer stars as they focus on judges more than musicians
One would normally think that a singing competition 
is supposed to be about the singer, the voice, the 
performance, and ultimately whether or not the people 
being discovered actually get discovered and go on to 
make their music heard. While some shows have amassed 
Grammy winners, Academy Award Winners, and a 
few Emmys, others have come short. Over the years, 
viewership has shifted dramatically between shows and 
ironically, it has had very little impact on the contestant’s 
success post-competition.
American Idol started the trend in the US of having 
primetime singing competitions. During its ?rst season, 
they found everything they needed in order to ensure 
continued success for years to come. Their formula was 
simple: Have a mean British producer that is honest and 
almost always right, a quirky pop star from the ’80s that 
has charm and is bubbly and somewhat crazy, and a 
lovable producer that also knows music but understands 
completely different genres than the ?rst. With Simon 
Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson they had 
the perfect combination of people to judge a singing 
competition. This competition was focused not on judges 
though, but on the contestants and their growth as 
artists. In their ?rst year they found one of the biggest pop 
idols. Kelly Clarkson has been a star since 2002 and she 
still continues to make music that people want to hear. 
This past week, American Idol dedicated the episode to 
her and had the contestants sing songs from her entire 
discography. Having been through the competition, she 
was a clear choice for coaching the contestants during 
the week and helping them ?nd their voice through her 
music. American Idol has lost almost half of its viewership; 
they still, however, maintain the simple premise of the 
show and they continue to make artists that actually sell 
music. Of all the U.S. singing competitions, American Idol 
has sold the highest number of albums. Chart-topping 
alumni include Carrie Underwood, Daughtry, Fantasia, 
Ruben Studdard, Jennifer Hudson, Clay Aiken, Katharine 
McPhee, Adam Lambert, and Jordin Sparks.
Another show that has produced actually successful 
artists is The X-Factor, although the U.S. competition 
only produced three acts that can be considered 
successful: Alex & Sierra, Fifth Harmony, and Emblem3. 
The show was cut off short on its third season due to low 
viewership. This was really unfortunate because the show 
had a lot of potential as it was following in the steps of 
its British predecessor that launched artists such as as 
Leona Lewis, One Direction, JLS, Alexandra Burke, Little 
Mix, and Cher Lloyd. The X-Factor suffered the same 
fate that The Sing-Off suffered. The Sing-Off was also 
a not too popular singing competition, and right when 
they found a group that has had massive success, the 
network cancelled them. These unfortunate decisions 
have been rumored to possibly get reversed. In 2014, The 
Sing-Off had a one day special event competition that was 
marketed poorly and did not attract viewership; and The 
X-Factor might return in 2015 according to rumors from 
past judges of the show.
Finally, we have The Voice. This program has a wonderful 
concept; a very humane way of selecting acts based solely 
on their voice. However, the show has one very key ?aw: 
The judges are competing against each other, and they 
are, except for Pharrell Williams, not known for being 
producers. Although this show has plenty of viewership 
and has topped ratings over American Idol, The X-Factor, 
and The Sing-Off, it still hasn’t been able to produce a 
single artist that has become a household name or has 
topped the Billboard Hot 100. Their highest charting 
artist peaked at 14 on Billboard and he was there for a 
mere week with a cover from another artist. Meanwhile, 
the judges that work on the show have released multiple 
albums in the four years, and eight seasons, that the show 
has been on, and have become even more successful and 
achieved greater visibility. The Voice is a great TV show 
because it’s about the judges, their relationships with 
each other, and their charisma; it is not about the singers 
or them ?nding their voice.
In the 13 years that singing competitions have been 
part of American TV culture, there has been a shift from 
shows focused on singing, to shows focused on judging. 
While the viewership and audiences have enjoyed this 
shift, musicians that participate in the shows have not 
bene?ted from this change since musicians that have 
come out of the highest-rated competitions have not 
been able to acquire mainstream recognition through 
their music. I believe that this is the main reason why 
American Idol is still going to remain the most relevant 
singing competition in the U.S.

Competitive singing shows like The Voice have now turned their focus to the competition between the judges, like

Fewer mainstream stars are coming out of shows like 
The Voice, unlike American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson.

Friday and Saturday evening, Scotch ‘n’ Soda 
daughter organization Tisbert Sketch Comedy put 
on its spring show. Modeled after some classic kids’ 
shows, Sketch by the Foot combined an amusing plot 
line surrounding the cash-strapped cast of the titular 
show with Tisbert’s usual mix of sketches about 
completely mundane situations gone mildly wrong 
in hilarious fashion. Each transition featured an 
updated remix of theme music from children’s shows 
from 15 to 20 years ago.
The night opened with first-year Dietrich College 
student Briana Hudock explaining that Tisbert Inc. 
had fallen on some hard times and that, to get by, 
they needed help from their new “friends” — “can 
you say corporate sponsor?” — Go-Gurt. The ancient 
yogurt-like snack tube … things … made frequent 
appearances and added a late ‘90s to early 2000s feel 
that fit the backdrop of the show nicely. Hudock’s 
monologue drew heavily on similar opening scenes 
from the always-relevant Dora the Explorer, the first 
in a series of blatant homages to the Nick Jr. classic.
The cast then came on and introduced themselves 
in a way reminiscent of Zoom and other similar 
shows from the turn of the millennium. First-year 
vocal performance major Russell H. Holbert even 
introduced himself with a middle initial, a necessary 
element of such a throwback. Each character had 
their own kids’ show archetype and accompanying 
explanation, featuring a “cute leader,” a “tough one,” 
a “smart one,” a “crazy one,” and, of course, the cast 
baby. By this point I was fairly worried I was going 
to see an endless round of gags on the shows I barely 
remember from my childhood, but luckily there was 
much more in store.
One of the high points of the show was easily a 
bit of fan service delivered by senior electrical and 
computer engineering and creative writing double 
major Brad Plaxen and senior BSA student Alex Petti. 
After a benign collision, the two lost their shirts 
and nearly came to blows before realizing that fists 
is not how they fight at this particular bar. Each 
then donned a cowboy hat, and, as Hudock counted 
them in, took three steps back in an old west style 
shootout. After a quick victory, Plaxen jumped onto 
junior BHA student Sam Riordan’s back and declared 
“Welcome to PHI,” a tribute to Carnegie Mellon’s 
favorite bar.
The show was not without its missteps, though. 
One scene, featuring girl scouts whose troop leader 
was replaced by some sort of military character, 
was funny but ultimately fell on its face. Hudock, 
Holbert, and Riordan excellently portrayed terrified 
girl scouts and nearly saved the scene as Petti, their 
new troop leader, attempted to scare them into being 
more efficient salespeople. Petti, however, did not 
help matters. His character featured an accent that 
seemed like it was going for Vietnam War Veteran, 
but only made the scene kind of awkward. Even 
his last quip about becoming addicted to black 
tar heroin in Vietnam was misplaced, weird, and 
somewhat confusing.
The kids’ show gags eventually came back, and were 
still as fresh and exciting as the first time around, 
despite my fears. Riordan informed the audience that 
Holbert was missing because he is a kleptomaniac. 
Holbert, who was excellent for every moment he was 
on stage, proceeded to run to different parts of the 
room, struggling to steal things from the auditorium. 
After an audience led search around Porter Hall 
100, the cast finally caught Holbert on stage, and 
proceeded to convince him he needed to get help 
with three chants of “Russell no stealing!”
In addition to some of the more shameless rips from 
popular culture, the more original features of the 
kids’ show setting were excellent. As the audience 
entered Porter Hall 100, they were asked to write 
letters to the cast members. Plaxen, for some reason 
the only cast member not wearing a solid black shirt, 
sat down on a stool with the letters by his side and 
read some of them. Two were scripted, but Plaxen 
navigated the pair of bizarre and unscripted letters 
he did pick up seamlessly, managing to both draw on 
his role as “the tough one” and accidentally let slip 
that Tisbert Inc. was actually the Illuminati.
The Go-Gurt soaked adventure through the TV 
show ended when the product placement cash was 
not quite enough to keep the lights on through the 
duration of one last song and dance. But while it 
lasted, Sketch by the Foot, when it hit, showcased 
more of Scotch ‘n’ Soda’s talent for escalation and 
absurdism.
As the cast — and totally not Dora the Explorer — 
would say, muy bien!

English indie-rock band alt-J performed to a huge 
audience on April 2 at the sold-out Benedum Center 
downtown. alt-J, with band members Joe Newman 
(guitar/lead vocals), newly recruited Cameron Knight 
(guitar/bass), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/
vocals) and Thom Green (drums), has become famous 
for their unique sound and haunting lyrics. These 
musical features have caused the band to carve 
out a brand of music all their own. Upon entering 
the beautiful venue, one found a full house calmly 
chatting in their seats. This isn’t a crowd you would 
expect to get rowdy, but it was able, eventually, to 
evolve into a gathering place for devotees of alt-J 
music’s lyrical depth.
Opening for alt-J was Tycho, where Scott Hansen, 
an “ambient music” artist and producer from San 
Francisco, displayed his talent for both techno music 
and harmonic artistry. His design skills were evident 
in the mesmerizing displays during his set, which 
featured mixed elements of beautiful photography 
and bold graphic styles that matched the lighting of 
the stage. Playing mostly tracks from his most recent 
album, 2014’s Awake, Tycho filled the hall with a 
glistening tone and took the audience on a carefully 
curated journey. The set was enhanced by his live 
backing band, whose energy made the performance 
much more interesting to watch. Though most of 
the audience stayed seated, 100 some remained 
entranced for the set and it served as the perfect 
opener for alt-J.
After Tycho and his band cleared the stage, bright 
lights rose up over the audience. The audience 
rose too as the first waves of “Hunger of the Pine” 
resonated through the building. Accompanying the 
band members on stage were dynamic LED lights 
that punctuated every note and set the mood of the 
entire space as alt-J moved through their set. Their 
set did an amazing job of flipping between tracks 
from their most recent album, This Is All Yours, and 
their first, An Awesome Wave; punctuating more 
trance-like songs such as melodic “Matilda,” with the 
arguably more upbeat and pop-sounding “Left Hand 
Free.” “Every Other Freckle” was a mesmerizing 
piece, with lights illuminating each band member as 
they played their part in a sophisticated marriage of 
light and sound. Unsurprisingly, alt-J excelled both 
with their lesser known ballads like “Dissolve Me” 
and with crowd favorites like “Tessellate,” greatly 
due to the range of Newman’s vocals.
Returning for an encore, the band moved through 
“Nara,” the three-piece song from their most recent 
album. The track brings a slightly more narrative 
nature to the album. Their set ended with my 
personal favorite “Breezeblocks,” an eerie love song 
that was much more affecting live than on record. 
This concert was very enjoyable primarily because of 
the dedication of the fans in the audience, who knew 
every word and key change by heart. Overall, alt-J 
delivered a captivating live performance, matching 
the talent level fans have come to expect from a 
group of this caliber. I certainly plan to see them 
again soon, hopefully in a festival setting so everyone 
can really get up and dance.

The Imitation Game
Friday, April 10 & Saturday April 11, 10 p.m.
Sunday April 12, 8 p.m.
Everyone’s favorite posh British actor Benedict Cumberbatch stars in this biopic epic. The Imitation Game follows “father of computer science” Alan Turing’s quest to break 
“Enigma,” a secret Nazi code that existed during the Second World War. Breaking the code allowed the British army to save many innocent lives and win the war much more 
quickly. Keira Knightley co-stars as a female member of Turing’s team and a complicated love interest. If you are not a fan of Keira Knightley, her performance here probably 
won’t win you over, even though it earned her a nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Alan Turing, Cumberbatch 
brings a sensitivity and vulnerability to Turing that audiences have not seen in the characters of Sherlock Holmes or Khan, the roles that launched him to fame. Punctuated 
with humor and sadness, the movie also follows the tragic life of Turing post-World War II, where he is punished by authorities for his homosexuality. Not only is Turing’s tale 
impressive and important, but for an audience of computer science-focused individuals, the movie also shows — albeit kind of vaguely — the construction of an early computer, 
christened Christopher.

Last Friday night, Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella groups 
came together to perform in the No Instruments Aloud 
2015 concert, hosted by the Originals. The groups 
who performed were Originals, C#, Treblemakers, 
Soundbytes, and Counterpoint.
The Originals took the stage in their classic shirt-and-tie 
combo, and entertained the crowd with everyone’s latest 
musical obsession, “Uptown Funk” by Mark Ronson and 
Bruno Mars. The Original’s amazing energy and in-your-
face charisma on stage had the audience, quite literally, 
bouncing along to the beat. Everyone loved it.
Following an awkward and slightly rushed MC blunder, 
Carnegie Mellon’s newest a cappella group, C#, took the 
stage. They looked ravishing in red as they opened their 
performance with Florence and the Machine’s “Never 
Let Me Go.” Their intricate dance moves and power-
ful voices made it hard to tell that this was one of C#’s 
first performances. They kept the crowd entertained 
all the way up to their comical take on the Taylor Swift 
song everyone loves to hate and hates to love, “We Are 
Never Ever Getting Back Together.” The only thing more 
impressive than C#’s vocals was their commitment to 
humor.
Taking the stage in their classic and recognizable gold 
and black ensembles, Treblemakers performed their 
diverse set. Although it has started to warm up for the 
spring season, their beautiful performance of “Sweater 
Weather” by The Neighbourhood reminded us of colder 
times. Treblemakers ended their piece with an exciting 
and crowd pleasing performance of Charli XCX’s “Boom 
Clap.” Treblemakers had all the components of a strong 
a cappella performance, including strong vocals, great 
song choices, and high energy. But after such a char-
ismatic performance from Originals, and a delightfully 
humorous ending to C#’s piece, Treblemakers’s perfor-
mance left something to be desired.
After intermission, the crowd was welcomed back with 
the concert’s next performers, Soundbytes. Soundbytes 
did a spectacular job putting a soulful spin on an Elton 
John classic, “Bennie and the Jets.” Judging by the 
applause, Soundbytes’ next song choice, “I See Fire” 
by Ed Sheeran, was also a crowd favorite. The perfor-
mance was strong and powerful, and it left the crowd on 
the edge of their seats. The group kept up their energy 
and momentum well into their third piece, and kept the 
crowd entertained from start to finish. They closed with 
an oddly true and painfully relevant “Ain’t It Fun” by 
Paramore.
Next on stage was Carnegie Mellon’s only all female a 
cappella group, Counterpoint. The group reminded the 
audience to always be themselves with their interpreta-
tion of Sara Bareilles’ hit song “Brave.” Counterpoint 
then took a moment to honor senior dramaturgy major 
Rachel Abrams, who then sang an edgy “Boy” by Little 
Mix. The “Boy” performance had the potential to be a 
moment for female empowerment, but in the end fell flat. 
The group’s voices were together and were quite strong, 
but the song choice did not have everyone in the audi-
ence on the same page. Counterpoint closed their per-
formance on a high note, however, with the popular Katy 
Perry song, “Dark Horse.” The crowd appreciated both 
the popular song choice and the group’s commitment to 
singing the entirety of Juicy J’s rap segment at the end 
of the song.
To close out the evening, Originals returned to the stage 
looking sleek and classic in new black shirts and ties. 
They opened their second set with a beautiful rendition 
of “Ghost” by Ella Henderson. Originals definitely wowed 
the crowd during their performance, but they somehow 
outdid themselves the second time around when they 
utilized the entire stage to perform new and improved 
dance moves and intricate formations. The group then 
serenaded the audience with a mash up of Justin 
Timberlake and Ella Fitzgerald’s “Cry Me A River”.
Originals then left the stage, and at this point the audi-
ence was absolutely content and thoroughly impressed 
with their performance. But then, in full concert fashion, 
the hosts once again returned and surprised the audi-
ence with a trip through all of our childhoods. The group 
sang a medley of hits from our friend in a pineapple 
under the sea, Spongebob SquarePants. The crowd 
was thoroughly entertained with such songs as “The 
Campfire Song” and “The Goofy Goober Song.”
Overall, all of the groups who performed made the 
night an exciting one. Joyful Noise was unable to be in 
attendance during No Instruments Aloud 2015, but we 
encourage everyone to watch the group perform on May 
2 in the College of Fine Arts. We also encourage you to

Skibo Café isn’t the first place you’d expect to hear live, 
soulful, acoustic renditions of some of your favorite songs. 
And yet, a small musical miracle occured last Thursday 
evening, when Skibo played host to a smattering of inde-
pendent campus musicians, all of whom played their 
hearts out in an attempt to enthrall those lucky enough 
to be present. Some of the music was utterly breathtak-
ing and some of it comparatively ordinary. The sheer 
intimacy of the setting, however ensured one thing: All 
of the music was brutally honest. The entire evening felt 
more like a bunch of close friends just messing around on 
stage with their instruments than artists performing at a 
concert.
Although called “Activities Board Presents: Varun Gadh,” 
the evening was really about so much more than just one 
guy. He was joined on stage by several others through 
his set, including an extremely talented percussionist, 
a female lead who completely stole the show while on 
stage, and two violinists for the grand finale of the eve-
ning. Not to mention, he was opened for by a spectacular 
duo that played for quite a while — probably more than 
half an hour.
Sophomore ethics, history, & public policy major Dhruva 
Krishna and first-year international relations and politics 
major Dave Matvey seemed so at home on stage that I 
found it hard to believe them when they told me they 
don’t routinely perform together. They had the kind of 
chemistry with each other and the audience that simply 
cannot be manufactured or practiced. It turns out that 
they were simply doing the Skibo thing as a one-off for 
Gadh. When I told them I’d be writing a review, and 
asked them to name themselves for my benefit, they went 
with “Benjamin Piatt Runkle,” in a show of extreme rever-
ence for one of their Sigma Chi fraternity co-founders.
They were outstanding as individual musicians as well. 
Krishna is obviously a very good guitarist, yet his method 
is restrained and measured in a way that doesn’t make 
his talent instantly apparent. As a result, although his 
chord work has no shortage of character, it allows Matvey 
to take the lead with the vocals. Dave has all the charisma 
a frontman needs and then some. He effectively channels 
a combination of Kurt Cobain, Dave Matthews and Jason 
Mraz. This works really well, as it allows him to switch 
from rebellious and brash to sensitive and caring at the 
shift of a chord. Half an hour later, by the time Benjamin 
Piatt Runkle left the stage, expectations for Gadh were 
sky high.
Coming on stage with his percussionist, first-year 
economics major Ariana Mapua, freshman mechani-
cal engineering major Varun Gadh started out with an 
original called “Shadow On The Wall.” “Shadow” is a fine 
song, with some amazing lyrics and what seemed like 
an unusual time signature. And yet, both he and Mapua 
seemed somewhat nervous and withdrawn throughout 
the song, as if they were still warming up to the stage. 
They weren’t as comfortable in the spotlight as the pre-
vious duo, and were trying visibly harder to please the 
audience. While it took them another couple of songs to 
get in the mood of things, there was no looking back once 
they did. What soon followed was an amazing cover of Bill 
Wither’s “Ain’t No Sunshine.”
The two of them play off of each other’s styles well. Gadh 
has a fine singing voice, and he knows which directions 
he can take it in without pushing too far. Ari effectively 
fills in the spaces he leaves behind with some genuinely 
stunning fills on her Cajon. One of their standouts was 
the difficult bridge from “Sunshine,” which started simple 
before building into a grand crescendo, following a crash 
and leading into the chorus — they completely nailed it.
The indisputable highlight of the evening, however, was 
when sophomore vocal performance major Mara Yaffee 
joined Gadh about halfway through the evening. The 
way they played, the way their voices harmonized, and 
the way their every move seemed to fit in lockstep was 
a sight to behold. Watching them play, I got the feeling 
that they were playing more for the fun of it, and for each 
other, than for the audience. They opened with a haunt-
ing acoustic cover of Soundgarden’s “Black Hole Sun.” 
“Black Hole Sun” is not an easy song to cover. These guys 
didn’t just cover it, they went ahead and changed it up. It 
takes no small amount of courage to do that. By the time 
they closed with Simon & Garfunkel’s “Mrs. Robinson,” 
they had won nearly everyone in Skibo over with their 
earnestness and charm. Although the finale was yet to 
come, the evening undoubtedly crescendoed with Yaffee’s 
time on stage.
The finale itself was underwhelming. The two violins 
that joined Gadh and his group onstage were completely 
drowned out by the guitar, since they hadn’t been set 
up all that well. I couldn’t make out much of the lyrics or 
vocals either. But by that point, it didn’t matter. Opening 
your heart up to strangers is supposed to be one of the 
most difficult things in the world. I’d just seen strangers 
open their hearts up to me and about thirty more people, 
through music. Although the evening wasn’t perfect, it 
was most definitely inspiring.

After a lengthy renovation the former Pizza Sola location 
on Atwood Street reopened a couple weeks ago as the 
location of Top Shabu-Shabu & Lounge. The restaurant 
was packed, although it was hard to determine how 
much of that came from the place being new and how 
much from the popularity of the Japanese takes on 
traditional hot pot styles of cooking. Either way, wait 
times for large parties can be very long and Top Shabu-
Shabu does not take reservations, so you may want to 
plan on arriving early.
The ?rst thing I noticed when I stepped into the 
restaurant was the rich smell of dozens of soups being 
cooked, each spiced to an individual patron’s taste and 
?avored with their choice of meats, veggies, noodles, 
tofu, seafood, and almost anything else you might want 
to ?ll a pot of soup with.
If you’re not familiar with shabu-shabu, you may be 
wondering why the whole place smells like soup. Unlike 
beef fondue, which uses heated oil to ?ash fry what you 
put in it — or some interpretations of hot pot where 
boiling water or a very light stock is used as the basis for 
your soup — shabu-shabu uses pre-packaged cans of 
rich ?avored soup.
Unfortunately, during my visit, Top Shabu-Shabu only 
had two choices of ?avor available: a very spicy hot 
option, and a mild hambone-?avored white soup. On 
the plus side, both were excellent. The spicier option 
imparted its ?avor nicely into chunks of fried tofu or 
slices of chicken breast. The white soup had a milder 
?avor pro?le that allowed me to to fully avail myself of 
the “sauce bar,” a collection of oils, spices, and premade 
sauces like Sriracha that you can mix and match to 
create a staggering number of options. My favorite was 
a mixture of garlic, chives, and hot sauce into sesame oil 
for a sweeter ?avor with a bit of a kick.
It was a very fun dining experience; three friends and 
I split the check evenly and for about ?fteen dollars 
a person we were able to get three different kinds 
of noodle, fried tofu, shrimp, potato slices, a plate of 
chicken, and both a meat and vegetable assortment 
platter. Mastery of chopsticks proved necessary, as you 
need to hold onto your meat for the 15 seconds it usually 
takes to cook; otherwise, you need to ?sh it out of the 
surprisingly deep pot of boiling soup with a ladle, which 
can prove somewhat frustrating.
I didn’t have the opportunity to try the more traditional 
foods on offer, but they seemed very popular with some 
of the other tables, and our server was kind enough to 
help us ?gure out some good things to order off of the 
extensive menu. He also had to tell us that they currently 
did not have some items, which was disappointing.
Another disappointment came in the form of the drinks. 
Despite applying for an alcohol license, by the time I 
visited, Top Shabu-Shabu had not gotten it yet, which 
meant the handsome dark wood bar was mainly just for 
show. My server also advised me not to get the tea since 
it was overpriced without free re?lls, which relegated 
me and my companions to ?ltered ice water. Some 
enterprising patrons did bring their own outside drinks 
though, so if I were you I’d bring my own favorite white 
wine or a sixer of a lighter Dutch or German style beer.
The restaurant was a bit loud and my party occasionally 
had trouble hearing each other across the wide table, but 
the atmosphere was energetic and youthful, much like 
the crowd. One of my dining companions said he would 
bring a ?rst date there, but his girlfriend said she wasn’t 
so sure how impressed she would have been.
Personally, I enjoyed myself and the food and I’m willing 
to chalk some of the absences and shortcomings to the 
place still gaining its footing. If you’ve got a few friends 
who you can share the large portions with and you want 
a relaxed evening, Top Shabu-Shabu and Lounge at 114 
Atwood Street in Oakland is a solid choice.
