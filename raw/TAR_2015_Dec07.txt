CMU Center for Human Rights Science receives $1 million
CHELSEA DICKSON
Staffwriter
YouTube, Facebook, and 
Twitter let the world watch 
the daily progress of massive 
social movements like the 
Arab Spring and the Black 
Lives Matter movement. Now, 
Carnegie Mellon’s own Center 
for Human Rights Science will 
help protect human rights by 
creating a system to collect 
and archive user generated 
media.
The John D. and Cath-
erine T. MacArthur Founda-
tion, Humanity United, and 
Oak Foundation recently do-
nated a collective $1,185,000 
to Carnegie Mellon’s Center 
for Human Rights Science for 
the development of instru-
ments to collect photographic 
and video evidence of human 
rights abuses, post-con?ict 
situations, and protests. 
With this new funding, the 
Center for Human Rights Sci-
ence will provide members 
of the human rights commu-
nity with technologies and 
abilities which presently only 
military, corporate and intel-
ligence personnel can access. 
They aim for these new prod-
ucts to promote transparency 
and human rights organiza-
tions’ leverage to protect vic-
tims of human rights abuses 
around the world. 
The director of the Center 
and associate professor of sci-
ence, technology, and society 
in the Department of History 
Jay D. Aronson said, “What 
we’re trying to do is level 
the playing ?eld and provide 
[information] to the human 
rights community as well.”
Aronson united Carnegie 
Mellon scientists and human 
rights defenders in 2011 by 
creating the Center for Hu-
man Rights Science. Aronson 
and an array of representa-
tives from Amnesty Inter-
national, the Carter Center, 
Human Rights Watch, the 
International Criminal Court, 
SITU Research, and the Syria 
Justice & Accountability Cen-
ter will guide the program’s 
expanding technology. 
Other Carnegie Mel-
lon faculty members direct 
the Center, including Alex 
Hauptmann, a principal sys-
tems scientist in the School of 
Computer Science’s Language 
Technologies Institute, and 
Yaser Sheikh, associate pro-
fessor in the CMU Robotics 
Institute.
Aronson founded the Cen-
ter for Human Rights Science 
in 2011 after multiple con-
versations with human rights 
organizations about their 
limited abilities to document 
technical human rights data. 
“The Center was really born 
out of requests for help,” said 
Aronson. “The idea was to cre-
ate a structure where I could 
build partnerships between 
the human rights community 
and faculty here or research-
ers here who had expertise 
that might be relevant to prob-
lems that the human rights 
community was increasingly 
facing at that time.” 
The Center is currently 
working on projects such as 
post -con?ict and post -disaster 
DNA identi?cation, as well as 
the Syrian Casualties Project.
As human rights organiza-
tions accumulated more user 
-documented footage of hu-
man rights abuses, the need 
to store the data increased. 
“One of the huge questions 
in this domain is archiving,” 
said Aronson. “I think that it’s 
really important to gather this 
information for posterity so 
that we can use it in the future 
and so that we can understand 
how other people can use it in 
the future.”
Yet, many online videos 
and photos of human rights 
abuses violate the terms of 
services of platforms, like 
YouTube and Facebook, be-
cause of their graphic content.

CMU’s ‘Giving Tuesday’ sets records for online donations
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Operations Manager
Carnegie Mellon broke 
previous fundraising records 
this year during its second 
signi?cant effort to fundraise 
for campus groups during a 
larger national day of giving. 
The university participated 
in #GivingTuesday, a global 
day of giving started by New 
York cultural center 92nd 
Street Y in 2012, by encour-
aging university constitu-
ents to give back to campus. 
#givingCMUday is Carnegie 
Mellon’s take on the event.
The Of?ce of Alumni Rela-
tions and Annual Giving ?rst 
embraced the event last year, 
largely carrying it out through 
social media, drawing out 
533 donors. This year, the of-
?ce set a goal to increase that 
donor count by 18 percent, to 
630 donors. Their ?nal donor 
count nearly doubled that 
number — 1,209 students, 
parents, alumni, staff, and fac-
ulty turned out to surpass that 
goal, according to the univer-
sity’s of?cial #givingCMUday 
website. They also broke the 
university’s record for the 
most donations received in 
one day, from 878 previous-
ly. These gifts amounted to 
$180,487.01.
The turnout overloaded 
the online system, according 
to Director of Annual Giving 
Mary Ann McCollough. This 
then prompted donors to call 
in gifts and pledge to send 
donations by mail. McCol-
lough said that the Of?ce of 
Annual Giving’s goal was to 
encourage donors to under-
stand that “there are thou-
sands of funds in this univer-
sity. Whether it’s your college,

As bicycling becomes more popu-
lar around the country and in Pitts-
burgh — according to non-pro?t 
and bicyclist advocacy group Bike 
Pittsburgh, the rate of Pittsburghers 
commuting by bike increased by 408 
percent in 2014 — both the local gov-
ernment and the university have tak-
en steps to change how bikers make 
their way around the city. 
In the fall of last year, for exam-
ple, the city announced the installa-
tion of artist-designed bicycle racks 
in the Cultural District downtown 
after implementing two new miles 
of protected bike lanes earlier that 
year. The new lanes were created as 
part of the Green Lane Project 2.0, an 
initiative from national organization 
PeopleForBikes.
These reforms play into Pitts-
burgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s “Complete 
Streets” initiative, announced in 
April. The ?ve-year, $32 million plan 
intends to make Pittsburgh’s streets 
safe for pedestrians and bicyclists 
alike with upgrades to traf?c signals, 
bike lanes, and sidewalks. Pittsburgh 
City Planning Director Ray Gastil said 
in the Complete Streets initiative’s 
?rst public meeting last Tuesday that 
the city expects to install 10 new 
miles of bike lanes per year over the 
next ?ve years.
Organizations outside of the gov-
ernment have also made efforts to 
make biking easier in Pittsburgh. 
Over the course of the last year, the 
Pittsburgh Bike Share has opened 50 
bike-sharing stations with 500 bikes 
powered by Healthy Ride, a small 
non-pro?t based in the Strip District. 
Using Healthy Ride, cyclists can rent 
bikes and return them to any station 
across the city. Erin Potts, director of 
marketing and outreach for the Pitts-
burgh Bike Share, told the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette that the service has had 
over 200,000 riders since May 31. 
Despite great strides, biking in 
Pittsburgh isn’t perfect. Bicyclists in 
Pennsylvania over the age of 12 are 
not required to wear a helmet, and 
last month an assistant director at 
the University of Pittsburgh’s Center 
for Russian and East European Stud-
ies was killed after being trapped 
between two vehicles while biking 
on Forbes Avenue in Oakland, less 
than a mile from Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus. 
At Carnegie Mellon, crowded bike 
racks around campus are a testament 
to how many students, faculty, and 
staff bike to, on, and around cam-
pus. James Wynn, a professor in the 
English Department, bikes to campus 
daily and keeps his bike in his Baker 
Hall of?ce. “[Biking in Pittsburgh] 
has been getting better and better,” 
Wynn said. “Riding Downtown has 
gotten a lot easier.” Wynn notes, 
however, that it is more dif?cult to 
bike to campus from some neighbor-
hoods than others. 
The path between Friend-
ship and Carnegie Mellon, for 
example, is strewn with high-traf?c 
thoroughfares.
Some students are having dif?-
culty reconciling Carnegie Mellon’s 
continued efforts at campus redesign 
with a bicyclist-friendly future.
A year ago The Tartan published a 
letter to the editor from Bruce Chan, 
a student in the Master of Urban De-
sign program in the College of Fine 
Arts who graduated in August. 
Chan took issue with the universi-
ty’s renovation of Legacy Plaza, what 
he calls “a truly inviting space for 
social and active interactions to hap-
pen.” The Plaza, strung with lights 
between West Wing and the Jared L.

The removal of bike racks around campus has prompted many to question Carnegie Mellon’s dedication to biking culture on campus, while many improvments around the city indicate that it will soon be a better place to bike.

A detailed record of a fast 
radio burst (FRB), a brief, 
brilliant eruption of cosmic 
radio waves from the distant 
universe, has been discovered 
by a team of astronomers that 
includes Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Jeffrey Peterson 
and Hsiu-Hsien Lin. It was 
identi?ed by Lin, a doctoral 
student in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Department of Physics.
Only 15 FRBs had been 
recorded before. The ?rst 
one was reported nearly a 
decade ago, but none of the 
previous documented events 
has provided more than the 
slimmest details about the 
origin of these mysterious 
?ashes of energy, until Lin’s 
?nding. Astronomers believe 
thousands of FRBs occur ev-
ery day in the observable uni-
verse. They last a fraction of a 
second, but carry an extraor-
dinary amount of energy and 
appear to come from random 
directions.
“I feel extremely lucky to 
have identi?ed the 16,” Lin 
said in a university press re-
lease. “Not only is this the 
?rst FRB in this frequency 
range, our FRB has provided 
us with a great deal of infor-
mation that help us to better 
understand this astrophysical 
phenomenon.”
The FRB was discovered 
after poring through 650 
hours of archival data from 
the National Science Founda-
tion’s Green Bank Telescope 
and analyzing over 6000 sig-
nals that could be possible 
FRBs. 
Unlike previously iden-
ti?ed FRBs, the newly dis-
covered FRB, named FRB 
110523, contained more de-
tails about its polarization 
than had ever previously 
been seen, and was in a dif-
ferent frequency range. With 
the new information, re-
searchers were able to deter-
mine that the burst originat-
ed inside a highly magnetized 
region of space, possibly link-
ing it to a recent supernova 
or the interior of a nebula, a 
star-forming region.
The results of this ?nding 
are published in the Dec. 3 is-
sue of Nature.
CMU grad student’s discovery sheds new light on mysterious cosmic radio waves
Carnegie Mellon developing a wearable cognitive assistant named “Gabriel”
Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University are devel-
oping a wearable cognitive 
assistant named “Gabriel” 
that will be able to “see” 
what its person is doing and 
give instructions for tasks as 
varied as repairing industrial 
equipment, resuscitating a 
patient, or assembling IKEA 
furniture.
The National Science 
Foundation has awarded the 
university a four-year, $2.8 
million grant to further de-
velop Gabriel. Gabriel uses 
a wearable vision system 
like Google Glass, as well as 
cloud computing, through a 
Carnegie Mellon innovation 
called a “cloudlet.” Cloudlets 
are data centers that provide 
the computational power of 
the cloud and are situated 
close to users, allowing Ga-
briel to work in real-time.
“The experience is much 
like a driver using a GPS 
navigation system,” said 
Mahadev Satyanarayanan, 
professor of computer sci-
ence and the principal in-
vestigator for Gabriel, in a 
university press release. “It 
gives you instructions when 
you need them, corrects you 
when you make a mistake 
and, most of the time, shuts 
up so it doesn’t bug you.”
The concept of Gabriel is 
similar to a robot in its use of 
sensing and task planning, 
except that the actuation is 
performed by a person in-
stead of a machine.
In addition to Satyana-
rayanan, the research team 
includes Martial Hebert, 
director of the Robotics In-
stitute and an expert on 
computer vision, Daniel 
Siewiorek, a professor in the 
Human-Computer Interac-
tion Institute and a pioneer 
in wearable computing, and 
Roberta Klatzky, professor of 
psychology and human-com-
puter interaction who spe-
cializes in human assistance 
technologies. “Ten years 
ago, people thought of this 
as science ?ction,” said Saty-
anarayanan. “But now it’s on 
the verge of reality.”

Dear fellow students,
As we approach our winter 
break holiday, it is imperative 
that I provide the following 
reminder to our student com-
munity:
Jibby and I need to know 
about any changes that you 
or any collection of students 
might envision for Carnegie 
Mellon. It is our responsibil-
ity to make time, if necessary, 
to hear what those changes 
are. When student govern-
ment agrees that your ideas 
will bene?t both you and our 
student body, it is also our 
responsibility to ?nd ways to 
help you transform your ideas 
into reality.
Serving the student body 
this semester has been an 
amazing experience. Help-
ing the Active Minds organi-
zation through our INSPIRE 
program to bring alumni art-
ist Kai Roberts back to cam-
pus, putting on events like 
student/faculty mixers and 
student-led town hall meet-
ings are just some examples 
of how Jibby and I have ap-
proached making Carnegie 
Mellon the best that it can be. 
But we’re not the only ones 
who have ideas on how to do 
so.
After participating in an 
event demonstrating our 
solidarity with the African-
American students at the Uni-
versity of Missouri, Jibby and 
I helped organize a meeting 
with the student orchestra-
tors who made that event 
happen. As a result of hearing 
of their dissatisfaction with 
the way race and diversity are 
addressed at Carnegie Mel-
lon, we are excited to help 
them work towards their 
goals aimed at promoting 
equality for all members of 
our campus community.
Jibby and I pursued our 
of?ces to provide an advo-
cate and activist platform 
for every student who calls 
Carnegie Mellon home. We 
are proud to do so for the 
student leaders mentioned 
above, and we are excited to 
hear how we might empower 
you as well. May your winter 
break be blessed and fun.

This poses a challenge for 
human rights defenders, 
who try to gather the user- 
generated media for statistics 
and evidence. Aronson seeks 
to address this problem: “The 
question then becomes, well, 
where do they keep it? Do 
they provide it to some orga-
nization for safekeeping? Do 
they keep it in their servers 
even if it violates their terms 
of service? It’s very challeng-
ing. I don’t expect direct col-
laborations with platforms.”
Aronson describes the 
technology used by the Cen-
ter for Human Rights Science 
as a “?ltering mechanism” 
that human rights defenders 
use to ?nd relevant images 
and the audio of human rights 
abuses. 
As of now, the Center’s 
most prominent projects ana-
lyze content from the Euro-
maidan protests in Ukraine 
and the ongoing con?ict in 
Syria. The Center anticipates 
collecting data from U.S. -
based protests and human 
rights abuses in the future. 
The reports from this project 
will be published in a series 
called Voice of Witness.
“One of the big things 
that we’re developing, what 
it will be able to do is to ?nd 
objects using computer vision 
and machine learning,” he 
said. “So tanks, helicopters. 
It works also for sounds. So 
particular kinds of weapons, 
you can key in and ask it to 
?nd a particular kind of sound 
of a particular type of weapon 
if you’re interested in that. 
Screams. Crying. It also works 
for some spoken language. So 
if there’s a particular phrase 
that a group uses or that’s of 
interest to you, you can search 
or that.”
Aronson recognizes the lim-
ited power of user -generated 
media in legal proceedings, 
but believes that it can aid a 
witness’s testimony. Videos 
and images provide context 
and perhaps proof of human 
rights abuses, even if they do 
not stand as direct evidence. 
The other challenge posed 
by user -generated content is 
the reputability of the con-
tent creators themselves. “I 
think the challenge is really 
to understand not just what’s 
being put online, but why. 
Every video tells a story, and 
every story provides some-
one’s perspective, and so it’s 
really important to under-
stand that part, in addition 
to trying to ?gure out how 
to extract information from 
these sources,” said Aronson.
The Center intends to 
share their developing tech-
nology with their current 
partners, including Human 
Rights Watch and Amnesty 
International. 
The Center’s leaders have 
not yet decided how to make 
the technology available to 
more human rights organiza-
tions, or even to the public, 
although they realize that the 
technology will probably be 
commercialized in the com-
ing years.
“We’re trying to ?gure out 
the best way to make the tech-
nology available to the human 
rights community, in a usable 
but also in a responsible way, 
in the sense that it’s power-
ful, it can extract things out of 
video quickly,” said Aronson.
Mossab Alsadig, a junior 
computer science major, was 
skeptical about the ability of 
user-generated content to in-
form people of the nuances of 
an issue. 
“The media is usually a 
small picture, so it’s natu-
rally going to be missing a 
lot of the context surround-
ing the initial issue,” she said. 
“And when that’s left out the 
conversations become re-
ally skewed, one sided, and 
uninformed.”
Junior statistics and tech-
nical writing major Angie 
Tang also voiced her concerns 
about social media’s role, yet 
ultimately approved its pur-
pose: “Overall, I think social 
media and user-generated 
content can positively bene?t 
the organization’s mission, 
since they show how these 
abuses and protests are a re-
ality. I think with the right 
organization, it can be a very 
powerful tool to help with 
social good.”
#givingCMUday initiative breaks fundraising records
Pittsburgh Health Association holds free STI testing at CMU
VALENE MEZMIN
Assistant News Editor
Last Friday, free sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) 
and human immunode?-
ciency virus (HIV) testing 
was held in Rangos Ballroom 
for Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity students. The event came 
days after World AIDS Day, 
which was last Tuesday, Dec. 
1, adding to many events be-
ing held around the world to 
bolster the ?ght against AIDS.
As stated on the event’s 
website, the many events sur-
rounding World AIDS Day 
seek to “unite people in the 
?ght against HIV, commemo-
rate those who have been lost 
to HIV/AIDS, educate, [and] 
reduce stigma around HIV/
AIDS.” Friday’s event, hosted 
by the Pittsburgh Health As-
sociation, included rapid test-
ing for HIV, gonorrhea, and 
chlamydia.
Statistically, it has been 
proven that one in six people 
in the United States go day-
to-day, unaware that they 
are infected. If left untreated, 
HIV can lead to AIDS — ac-
quired immunode?ciency 
syndrome — and very seri-
ous health defects and other 
life-limiting conditions. After 
10 to 15 years, HIV will have 
already severely damaged the 
immune system. Many may 
subscribe to the mentality of 
“that could never happen to 
me,” but nothing is known for 
sure until tests con?rm, and 
that is the message this event 
was seeking to spread.
“Don’t be afraid or 
ashamed to get tested” said 
Jade Schiffer, a sophomore 
decision science major and 
peer health advocate. 
Apart from free HIV and 
STI testing at the event, there 
were also tables set up out-
side of Rangos for the already 
established “Free Condom 
Friday.” Julian McClain, a 
representative for the Pitts-
burgh AIDS Task Force, was 
also present to provide in-
formation about his organi-
zation’s contribution in the 
?ght to minimize the spread 
of HIV. The organization has 
taken the initiative to reach 
out to high schools and col-
leges to raise awareness of 
HIV and AIDS. “Once we start 
outreaching to 25 or 26 year 
olds, it’s already too late,” 
said McClain.
Also available was litera-
ture providing information 
about pre-exposure pro-
phalyxis, or “PrEP.” PrEP is 
a small blue pill that a per-
son can take every day that 
prevents them from getting 
HIV 99 percent of the time. 
With the additional use of 
condoms, as usual, this pill is 
extremely helpful for HIV pre-
vention with regular sexual 
activity or, if one has an HIV-
positive partner.
In addition to the HIV test-
ing that was being conducted 
in Rangos, “Why not get some 
information about a blue pill 
that could protect you for the 
rest of your life?” McClain 
said. 
In honor of World AIDS 
Day, this Thursday, the Pitts-
burgh AIDS Task Force will 
be hosting a “PrEP Rally” at 
the Kelly Strayhorn Theater 
7:30–9:30 p.m. This event 
serves as an of?cial infor-
mation session for PrEP. It 
will include talks from HIV 
specialists and other com-
munity members for anyone 
interested in the new PrEP 
pill. Other events include a 
drag queen cheer squad and 
a vogue dance showcase. The 
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force is 
one organization that is tak-
ing steps in the ?ght against 
AIDS.
As for recommendations 
for ways students at Carnegie 
Mellon can prevent the spread 
of HIV, Peer Health Advocates 
has several recommenda-
tions: Early detection is bet-
ter, so be sure to be tested as 
necessary. Make informed de-
cisions about sexual activity 
and medical treatment. The 
tests that were performed at 
this event can also be con-
ducted at University Health 
Services on campus. Tests are 
free of charge with university 
health insurance. A rapid HIV 
test, which is simply taken 
with an oral swab, only costs 
students without university 
insurance $20.

tion to choose any campus

The Of?ce also ran ?ve 
planned social media chal-

lenge throughout the day, 
including one which asked 
campus members to tweet 
which fund they believe is

Randomly selected winners 
received $500 toward their 
fund of choice. 
The School of Drama 
Showcase and a currently un-
announced winner as of press 
time received money for a 
challenge that asked campus 
members to tell how Carnegie 
Mellon philanthropy impacts 
their lives. 
Kappa Alpha Theta and 
service organization Juntos 
received money for a chal-
lenge to ?lm a Vine wishing 
a stranger “Happy #givingC-
MUday.” Winners of other 
challenges include Camp Ke-
sem, a group that organizes 
recreational camps for chil-
dren of parents with cancer, 
the Tepper Class of 2016, and 
Mock Trial, among others.
In addition to these chal-
lenges, representatives from 
the Of?ce of Annual Giving 
tabled in the Jared L. Cohon 
University Center, where they 
asked students to write the 
name of an organization they 
believe deserves $500 on a 
heart-shaped sticky note to 
post on the wall. 
Thanks to the generosity 
of ?ve alumni donors, ?ve of 
the 362 notes were randomly 
selected to win $500. Another 
almunus offered to match 
student donations up to $500 
in donations to support the 
Presidential Fellowship and 
Scholarship program.
However, the reception 
among students was not as 
overwhelming. Senior civil 
engineering major Erin Pers-
son said that “Most of us don’t 
have steady income or extra 
money to give out, and we 
shouldn’t be expected to give 
more as students.” In order to 
combat this type of negative 
reaction, McCollough shared 
that in future years the of?ce 
plans to do more advertising 
prior to the event to ensure 
better student understand-
ing. “First it’s the awareness, 
then it’s the education, and 
then it’s participation. And we 
have to continue to cultivate 
that,” said McCollough. “Fun-
draising is no longer a letter in 
the mail.”
In July, Carnegie Mellon 
hired Scott Mory as vice presi-
dent for university advance-
ment in order to spark fund-
raising efforts. 
Previously, Mory led the 
efforts of the University of 
Southern California on a cam-
paign to raise $6 billion, one 
of the largest university cam-
paigns in history. 
This comes alongside re-
cent efforts focused on giv-
ing such as last November’s 
launch of www.crowdfund-
ing.cmu.edu which allows 
student organizations to use 
the platform for 30 days, and 
the donation incentives for 
the class of 2015. Because giv-
ing factors into the algorithm 
that determines university 
ranking, Carnegie Mellon is 
making efforts to better its 
standing.
The larger #GivingTues-
day initiative raised $116.7 
million this year, with 698,961 
donations made at a mean gift 
size of $107.47, according to 
the initiative’s website.

Cohon Center, is home to the 
Tartan Express food truck and 
outdoor seating for students. 
One thing, however, is con-
spicuously missing — bicycle 
racks.
“The redesign does not 
provide any bike parking. In 
fact, the existing bike racks 
on the north entrance of 
Margaret Morrison Hall were 
relocated on Nov. 3 to the 
north side of West Wing and 
Resnik House,” Chan wrote to 
The Tartan. “This is all part of 
the university’s larger plan to 
keep bicycles on the perim-
eter of campus…. Cyclists will 
park their bikes at the closest 
entrance of their destination 
and lock up to whatever is 
most convenient: trees, the 
railing, benches, chairs, and 
maybe the food truck itself. 
This rogue parking will only 
add clutter to the new Leg-
acy Plaza and diminish its 
quality.”
In a recent interview with 
The Tartan, Chan said that 
he is still working to make 
life better for cyclists in Pitts-
burgh. Certain neighbor-
hoods, Chan says, are almost 
inaccessible from campus 
by bike. “Right now a lot of 
students are stuck living in 
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill 
because of the inaccessibil-
ity to campus,” Chan said. “If 
CMU was able to really em-
brace students biking more, 
grad students and undergrads 
could live further away from 
campus and have more access 
to affordable housing.”
In September, junior elec-
trical and computer engineer-
ing major Don Zheng posted 
a picture of a bike chained to 
the Judith Resnik memorial 
on the Academic Mall to the 
Overheard at Carnegie Mel-
lon Facebook group, which 
has over 13,000 members. 
Commenters on the post at-
tributed the misplaced bicycle 
to a shortage of bike racks 
on campus — “CMU is add-
ing bike racks, but not fast 
enough,” senior computer 
science major Stuart Guertin 
wrote.
John Pyun, a senior phys-
ics major, has had dif?culty 
?nding a place to park his 
bike among the construction 
on campus. 
“It got harder to ?nd a 
place to lock up my bike af-
ter they started the construc-
tion, and I have to ride my 
bike around campus multiple 
times to ?nd a place to park,” 
Pyun said. 
Pyun has also had his 
bike stolen, and as a result 
switched from a cable lock to 
a more secure U-lock, making 
it hard to chain his bike to ob-
jects that aren’t bike racks. 
Students can register their 
bikes with University Police in 
case of theft, but several bikes 
each week are still stolen from 
campus, according to weekly 
crime and incident reports 
sent to The Tartan. 
Chan said that although 
biking around campus can 
be dif?cult, the administra-
tion has been responsive in 
dealing with the concerns of 
bikers through organizations 
such as the Bicycling Advisory 
Committee (BAC), originally 
founded by Ph.D. candidate 
in rhetoric Mary Glavan as 
part of the Graduate Student 
Assembly.
Karen Brooks, co-chair of 
the BAC and self-identi?ed 
“freelance bike geek,” has 
been working with Director of 
Parking & Transportation Ser-
vices Michelle Porter to meet 
bikers’ needs on and around 
campus. Brooks also serves on 
the board of Bike Pittsburgh. 
“It’s a group of students, staff, 
faculty working to make bicy-
cling better,” Brooks said of 
the BAC. 
The BAC also offers class-
es, such as How to Ride in 
Traf?c, to bikers on campus.
“We’re working to iden-
tify where the parking is and 
where it should be,” Brooks 
said of bike racks on campus. 
“Obviously there are a lot of 
bikes that get locked to rail-
ings and trees and all kinds 
of stuff, and it turns out that 
there are also some bike 
racks in the basement of ga-
rages and stuff where no one 
ever parks. I’ve been able to 
work with facilities to make 
some small changes here 
and there — move racks, put 
them places that are more 
convenient during construc-
tion — but we’re looking 
for a whole campus-wide 
sweep and distribution of 
the racks in the next couple 
of months.”
Brooks also acts as an 
ad hoc liaison between Bike 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mel-
lon; Bike Pittsburgh has been 
working with Director Design 
of Campus Design and Facil-
ity Development Bob Reppe 
to keep bikers in mind as the 
university expands.
 “Scott Bricker, the execu-
tive director [of Bike Pitts-
burgh], has been working 
with Bob Reppe and various 
other campus administra-
tive staff to make sure that 
we’re advocating for the same 
things, and present a uni-
?ed front as far as the city 
goes, and other entities like 
PennDOT and the Port Au-
thority,” Brooks said.
The Tepper Quadrangle, 
for example, will help con-
nect campus to the Panther 
Hollow Trail via bike paths. 
The Panther Hollow Trail, 
currently dif?cult to access 
from campus, links Oakland 
directly to Downtown and 
Southside without using ma-
jor roads. “Essentially they’ll 
connect campus and Neville 
to the path. The path then 
goes down Panther Hollow 
and connects to the Eliza Fur-
nace trail, which goes directly 
to Southside and Downtown,” 
Brooks said. 
Both Brooks and Chan ac-
knowledge that there’s still 
work to be done for bikers and 
pedestrians on and off cam-
pus. “Fortunately, the campus 
itself is pretty safe, it’s pretty 
isolated,” Brooks said, “But as 
soon as you step off campus it 
gets pretty dangerous.” 
Chan highlighted the im-
portance of the bus stops at 
the intersection of Forbes and 
Morewood avenues as links 
between Carnegie Mellon and 
the rest of the city, but noted 
that the intersection is dan-
gerous for bikers. 
“That bus stop, it’s right 
in the middle of the street,” 
Chan said. “There are talks 
of a safer way to cross More-
wood and Forbes to access 
those points of transporta-
tion, and talk of a bike lane at 
Forbes to improve the safety 
of that intersection.” 
Chan agrees, however, that 
biking in Pittsburgh is getting 
better. “One of the reasons 
I chose to go to CMU for ur-
ban design is because there’s 
a real culture of advocacy for 
transportation,” Chan said. 
“As part of my education I re-
ally wanted a city that had a 
robust and well-known ad-
vocacy group, and Bike Pitts-
burgh is known nationally as 
a great organization, and they 
have a great relationship with 
CMU.”

CMU students to compete in Robot Art 2016 contest
JOSH BROWN
Assistant Copy Manager
Creativity is not just for 
human artists any longer. The 
?rst annual Robot Art competi-
tion is currently being held, and a 
team of Carnegie Mellon students 
are working hard to create a ro-
bot with artistic abilities. This in-
ternational competition, created 
and sponsored by Andrew Conru, 
an entrepreneur who founded 
FriendFinder Networks Inc., has 
cash prizes of up to $100,000 
for the winning team’s institu-
tion. But more than that, it is a 
call for collaboration. Through 
the combined efforts of the par-
ticipants, Conru hopes that the 
contest will breed a collabora-
tion between roboticists which 
will lead to advancements in the 
artistic capacity of robots. Going 
further, the Robot Art initiative 
could perhaps create the oppor-
tunity for technology to gain a 
semblance of humanity. “I want 
to support education and human-
ize technology,” Conru said in 
a press release from Robot Art’s 
website. “If robots can commu-
nicate through artwork that pro-
vokes humans to think, feel, and 
do,” Conru believes that there 
might be a shift in the public per-
ceptions of robots and arti?cial 
intelligence.
The Carnegie Mellon con-
tenders are a team of four: 
Kim Baraka, a robotics masters 
student, 
and Su Baykal, a senior in hu-
man-computer interaction and a 
science and humanities scholar, 
as well as Yeliz Karadayi and 
Robert Zacharias, architecture 
masters students. All four are 
students of Robotics Institute 
faculty member Illah Nour-
bakhsh’s Human-Robot 
Interaction (HRI) 
class.The team ?rst       
    
    
ventured into the world of artistic 
robotics when they discovered a 
shared interest in a project con-
necting robotics and art and 
naturally began working together 
within the class. In an interview 
with The Tartan, Kim Baraka, 
the group’s leader, said “the 
course project we came up with 
involved a study whose aim was 
to get an understanding of how 
humans could co-operate with a 
Glow-in-the-dark solid form of carbon discovered 
Last Wednesday, materi-
als scientists Jagdish Narayan 
and Anagh Bhaumik from 
North Carolina State Univer-
sity in Raleigh reported on a 
new solid form of carbon in the 
Journal of Applied Physics. This 
new carbon, called Q-Carbon, 
glows in the dark, is magnetic, 
and is tougher than diamond, 
another solid form of carbon.
“Q-carbon’s unusual prop-
erties make it ideal for all sorts 
of applications, from electronic 
displays to abrasive coatings 
on tools to biomedical sensors 
that are compatible with the 
body” Narayan said. One of Q-
carbon’s most exciting features 
is its magnetism, since no other 
form of carbon is magnetic.
Narayan and Bhaumik cre-
ated Q-carbon with a laser 
heating technique, using a 
high-powered laser beam to hit 
a carbon pellet and spread the 
carbon thinly onto a ?at sheet 
of sapphire. The carbon was 
then melted and cooled rapidly 
to transform it into a new ma-
terial. In Q-carbon, the carbon 
tetrahedral structures are all 
jumbled up instead of form-
ing neat lattices, as is the case 
in diamonds. Because of their 
similar structure, the research-
ers can convert Q-carbon to 
diamond at standard tempera-
ture and pressure by providing 
the seeds for crystal growth.

Magnetic ?elds at Milky Way’s black hole found
Researchers have recently 
detected magnetic ?elds just 
outside the event horizon of 
Sagittarius A-star (Sgr A*), 
the black hole at the center of 
the Milky Way Galaxy.
 “These magnetic ?elds 
have been predicted to ex-
ist, but no one has seen them 
before. Our data puts de-
cades of theoretical work on 
solid observational ground,” 
said principal investigator 
Shep Doeleman from the 
Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
for Astrophysics and MIT’s 
Haystack Observatory.
The magnetic ?elds were 
discovered using the Event 
Horizon Telescope (EHT), a 
global network of radio tele-
scopes that link together to 
function as one world-wide 
telescope. 
With the EHT, the re-
searchers observed that light 
is linearly polarized near the 
event horizon and, since po-
larized light is emitted by 
electrons spinning around 
magnetic ?elds, the light di-
rectly traces the magnetic 
?eld structure of Sgr A*.
“With this result, the EHT 
team is one step closer to solv-
ing a central paradox in as-
tronomy: why are black holes 
so bright?” Doeleman said. 
The results have been report-
ed in the journal Science.

International panel approves human gene editing
During an international 
summit on Dec. 3, the U.S. Na-
tional Academies of Sciences 
and Medicine, the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, and the 
United Kingdom’s Royal So-
ciety convened to discuss the 
ethical, legal, and regulatory 
consequences of gene-edit-
ing. The scientists concluded 
that human gene-editing re-
search could begin so long as 
no pregnancies result.
Gene editing tools such as 
CRISPR/Cas9 have become 
very cheap and easy to use, 
and may be useful in cor-
recting genetic diseases. On 
December 1, Sangamo Bio-
Sciences, a biopharmaceuti-
cal company, announced that 
clinical trials to replace a bro-
ken gene in adult hemophili-
acs using gene editing could 
begin next year, which would 
fall under current regulations 
for gene therapy.
The catch is that no preg-
nancies can result from gene 
editing research, and the 
committee said it would be 
“irresponsible” to proceed 
with human studies in germ-
line cells. “As long as those 
cells are not implanted into 
a woman to create a baby, it 
is not germline editing,” said 
committee chairman Da-
vid Baltimore, a 1975 Nobel 
Laureate.

Archaeologists explore intact Etruscan tomb
While working in a ?eld of 
Città della Pieve, a small town 
about 30 miles southwest of 
Perugia, a farmer discovered 
a rare and undisturbed Etrus-
can burial site that was dated 
to approximately 300 B.C.E.
The Etruscan people were 
a civilization that dominated 
Italy from 900 to 400 B.C.E. 
and was eventually absorbed 
into the roman empire.
The Etruscans were 
known for their art, agricul-
ture, ?ne metalworking, and 
commerce. Some of their in-
?uences include introducing 
wine-making to the French, 
teaching the Romans how to 
build roads, and introducing 
writing into Europe. Howev-
er, the Etruscan culture had 
always been a mystery due to 
a lack of records document-
ing their society. 
After archaeologists came 
and opened the tomb, which 
was dated from the fourth 
century, the team found two 
sarcophagi, as well as other 
artifacts, within a 16 square-
foot chamber. One of the 
sarcophagi contained the 
tomb of a male, thought to be 
named Lars. 
The researchers anticipate 
that the discovery will allow 
them to learn more about 
the world’s most mysterious 
ancient cultures.

Scientists study reactions in solar energy storage
Researchers at the 
University of Oregon have 
developed a new method to 
study the reactions that occur 
as water-splitting cells pro-
duce fuel from absorbing sun-
light. Particularly, the group 
had found a way to study the 
exchange of electrons at the 
interface of two cells. One of 
the cells was a semiconductor 
that generated electrons after 
capturing sunlight, while the 
other cell was a catalyst that 
produces fuel out of those 
electrons.
In their experiment, the 
researchers coated an electri-
cally charged titanium diox-
ide electrode with different 
?lms of catalyst. They then 
monitored the accumula-
tion of charge and change in 
voltage on the catalyst. 
From their results, the 
scientists found that more 
energy was derived from 
the interfaces of catalysts 
that were permeable to ions, 
which are charged atoms or 
molecules. While the system 
from the experiment was not 
the most ef?cient, the group’s 
study may contribute to the 
design of more effective 
semiconductor-catalyst de-
vices. The research has been 
published in ChemSusChem, 
a journal that covers research 
in sustainable chemistry.

Samsung to pay Apple to settle patent dispute
Last Thursday, papers sent 
to a California court indi-
cated Samsung’s agreement 
to pay Apple $514 million, 
which will settle a patent dis-
pute between the two com-
panies. A statement declared 
that the payment would take 
place within 10 days after an 
invoice was received.
 This agreement is part 
of a larger $1 billion lawsuit 
?led in 2012 which claimed 
that Samsung’s copyright 
infringements on Apple’s 
patented technology. For 
example, one of the patents 
that Apple brought to court 
included the “pinch to zoom” 
feature on smartphones, a 
case that was later invali-
dated by the United States 
Patent and Trademark Of?ce 
(USPTO). 
Shortly afterward, Sam-
sung also attempted to bring 
the case to the US appeals 
court, but the company was 
then denied the opportu-
nity. Despite the settlement, 
the dispute between the two 
companies will continue to 
drag on, as the USTPO con-
tinues to review the validity 
of some of Apple’s patents, 
and as Samsung intends to 
?le new appeals.

Novel hardware systems developed to improve prosthesis
JONATHAN CALVELLO
Staffwriter
In the United States alone, 
there are over one million am-
putees, people who suffer from 
some sort of limb loss. One of 
the most dif?cult things about 
making life better for these 
amputees is developing robust, 
effective prosthesis technology 
that can supplant the role of 
regular human limbs. The intri-
cate locomotion and modalities 
of muscle movement are com-
plex, and these obstacles pose 
dif?culties for scientists in de-
veloping prosthesis equipment.
In effort to abate these dif-
?culties, Steve Collins, an as-
sociate professor in Carnegie 
Mellon’s Department of 
Mechanical Engineering, and 
Hartmut Geyer, an assistant 
professor in Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Robotics Institute, along 
with a team of researchers, are 
working to develop innovative 
prosthesis technology that bet-
ter addresses current issues 
facing leg prostheses, such as 
maintaining balance and the 
energy cost of walking. The 
team’s new technology centers 
around modeling the re?exes 
that control walking via com-
puter simulations, implement-
ing those neuromuscular 
re?exes into prosthetic legs, 
and studying how well the 
prostheses mimic the re?exes. 
Although these re?exes are 
very intricate, we are all famil-
iar with them. For example, 
during a doctor’s visit, when 
the doctor taps your kneecap, 
the local re?exes in your leg 
muscles produce the observed 
jerking motion.
Understanding these re?ex-
es can lead to solutions for some 
of the problems amputees have 
when using prosthesis. For ex-
ample, balance is currently one 
of the major issues with leg 
prostheses. Human limbs’ re-
?exes can respond to imbalanc-
es in terrain. This allows them 
to adapt their gait while walk-
ing to maintain balance. While 
current prostheses attempt to 
mimic these re?exes, they lack 
the technology to properly rep-
licate natural leg motion. Geyer 
and Collins are trying to gain a 
better understanding of what 
local re?exes in the leg control 
balance and how to implement 
those re?exes into prostheses. 
“Our work is motivated by the 
idea that if we understand how 
humans control their limbs, 
we can use those principles to 
control robotic limbs,” Geyer 
said. So far, their models have 
been able to respond to distur-
bances at the beginning and 
the end of the prosthesis’s leg-
swing. Although these results 
are promising, Geyer recogniz-
es that there is more to be done, 
as the model still has issues 
with leg-swing disturbances.
To supplement this work, 
Collins is developing prosthetic 
knee simulator systems, which 
he calls universal device emu-
lators. These systems are de-
signed to be able to test the out-
put performance of prosthetic 
limbs based on variations in 
prosthesis design. The aim in 
designing these systems is to al-
low scientists to test variations 
While current prostheses attempt to mimic these re?exes, they lack the 
technology to properly replicate natural leg motion. Geyer and Collins 
are trying to gain a better understanding of what local re?exes in the leg 
control balance and how to implement those re?exes into prostheses.

Encryption is the process 
of converting any text or mes-
sage into a form that cannot be 
understood by a person who 
does not have information re-
garding how the conversion 
was made. The non-coded 
message is called plaintext 
and the converted message 
is called cipher text. One can 
change the cipher text back to 
plaintext using an algorithm 
(called the cipher) which 
gives a certain set of possible 
values and a key that leads to a 
speci?c value when used with 
the cipher text and the cipher. 
The key and the cipher contain 
all the information about the 
conversion between plaintext 
and cipher text.
Encryption is a way to hide 
and transport sensitive infor-
mation. Credit card numbers 
for online transactions, social 
security numbers in employee 
databases, and other personal 
and ?nancial information all 
need to be encrypted.
 For example, when mak-
ing a purchase online, a per-
son types in their credit card 
details and sends it to the site. 
While this information is being 
sent, an attacker could poten-
tially extract that information 
and use it for nefarious pur-
poses. The point of encryption 
is to secure the data so that no 
one can access, understand, or 
use it besides the person that 
sends the data and the person 
that is supposed to receive it.
The best encryption sys-
tem is one that is unbreak-
able. However, for practical 
purposes, quality encryption 
is one where even if the cipher 
is known publicly, the mes-
sage cannot be decoded. Basi-
cally, only a person with a key 
should be able to decrypt the 
message. Also, the attacker 
shouldn’t be able to “guess” 
the key based on a numerical 
pattern. That is, the algorithm 
should be good and no one 
should be able to try all possi-
ble key combinations in a fea-
sible amount of time, meaning 
the key-size should be long.
There are two kinds of 
commonly used encryption 
techniques — symmetric key 
encryption and asymmetric 
key encryption. Symmetric 
key encryption is relatively 
simple: Both the receiver and 
the sender have a common 
key that can be used to de-
code or code the message. In 
asymmetric key encryption, 
the receiver has a public key 
that is visible to anyone who 
wants to send a message. The 
sender sends a message using 
the public key to the receiver. 
After that, the receiver has a 
private key that is con?den-
tial, which is used to decode 
the message.
One commonly used sym-
metric cipher is the American 
Encryption Standard (AES), 
originally called the Rijndael 
after its creators, Joan Dae-
men and Vincent Rijmen. AES 
rearranges a given message 
and transforms it in several 
rounds, using relationships 
with a key, that are repeated 
depending on the length of 
the key. That is, AES with a 
128-bit key would undergo 
10 repetitions, with each 
repetition having four rounds. 
So hypothetically, one can en-
crypt the message using the 
key and performing the op-
erations and decrypt it by us-
ing the key and performing all 
those operations backwards.
An example of asymmetric 
encryption is the RSA algo-
rithm, named after its inven-
tors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, 
and Len Adelman. The RSA 
algorithm involves the use of 
prime numbers and the prime 
factoring problem. Again, 
broadly speaking, the algo-
rithm depends on the product 
and factorization of two arbi-
trary, very large prime num-
bers, for example those with 
over 100 digits. The fact that 
there currently exists no ef-
?cient algorithm in the world 
to factor a number forms the 
basis of this system. In this 
case, the two prime numbers 
are kept con?dential and their 
product is published as the 
public key, along with an ex-
ponent that plays a major role 
in converting the message. 
The private key comprises a 
different exponent and the 
product of the prime factors, 
which is used to convert the 
cipher text to plain text.
These are only a few of 
the encryption methods cur-
rently in use. Research is be-
ing done on other approaches 
to encryption such as “honey 
encryption,” where incorrect 
attempts to break the cipher 
produce data that seems right 
but isn’t; “functional encryp-
tion,” where the key reveals 
only a certain aspect of data 
that the sender wishes to 
share; and “quantum key 
encryption,” which uses the 
quantum properties of atoms 
to encrypt data. 
Each of these systems, and 
others that are being pro-
duced, will hopefully provide 
new methods of encryption 
that will give users even better 
security in the future.
HOW THINGS WORK
CMU researchers study issues with current prostheses
on what they think are effective 
prostheses models, and then 
run experiments to determine 
the success of the model. The 
systems are also designed to be 
?exible, so that scientists can 
quickly and easily tweak parts 
of the prosthesis and observe 
how these tweaks affect output. 
By developing these hardware 
systems, Collins hopes to de-
liver better conclusions about 
what prostheses need, and thus 
how to better design them.
One of the outcomes Col-
lins hopes to see with these 
emulators is their application 
as clinical tools to improve 
the prescription of prostheses 
to amputees. Much like 
optometrists prescribe glasses 
based on a series of vision 
tests, Collins believes the same 
can be done for amputees us-
ing these systems “by quickly 
changing the behavior of the 
robotic device, thereby quickly 
optimiz[ing] the prosthesis for 
each individual patient.” 
Additionally, Collins hopes 
to use these systems to continue 
studying and optimizing pros-
theses so that eventually they 
can outperform their able-bod-
ied counterparts. The group 
strives to develop technologies 
that can supersede current 
limitations on prosthetic limbs, 
and it has already experienced 
some success in this endeavor: 
“Earlier this year, we developed 
an exoskeleton that reduces the 
cost of walking,” Collins said.
Although the focus of these 
technologies is to develop bet-
ter prostheses, another goal of 
Collins and Geyer’s research 
is implementing the technol-
ogy into human augmentation. 
Once the team has developed 
effective prosthetic models and 
?nalized the universal device 
emulators, they will hopefully 
turn to using these technolo-
gies to improve physical perfor-
mance for people without any 
amputations.
The boundaries of such ap-
plications, which could theo-
retically range from improving 
military personnel to enhanc-
ing athletic activity, provide 
ample space for imaginative, 
novel applications.

Steve Collins, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Hartmut Geyer, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, are developing hardware systems called 
universal device emulators, capable of quickly testing variations in prostheses design, which will allow researchers to understand how to improve prosthetic limbs and hopefully lead to improved designs and prescription.

PUGWASH
Terrorist social media usage requires complex solutions
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Staffwriter
When an act of terror-
ism occurs, news of the event 
spreads quickly through social 
networks. But sadness and 
outrage aren’t the only senti-
ments that get passed along — 
terrorists themselves also use 
social networks to bolster their 
cause. At last week’s Pugwash 
meeting, we discussed what 
could be done in response to 
social technology being used 
for nefarious purposes.
One of the ?rst points 
raised was the question of 
who should be responsible. Is 
it the duty of companies like 
Twitter or Facebook to ?nd 
terrorist content and remove 
it? Some argued that it’s not 
the job of private organiza-
tions to be deciding what is 
or isn’t allowable content, 
but others said that organi-
zations already make moral 
or political decisions, such as 
removing barbarity, or mak-
ing an option to change pro?le 
pictures to celebrate gay mar-
riage.
Another concern was that 
even if regulations were in 
place and big sites like Twitter 
and Facebook removed terror-
ist content, would that even 
accomplish anything? There 
will always be more websites 
willing to host terrorist mate-
rials, or sites built by terror-
ists themselves. Trying to shut 
down activity on the internet 
is like trying to use your ?n-
gers to plug a leaking dam.
Other Pugwash members 
wondered if it was really 
worth the effort to stop tweets 
or Facebook posts when there 
are so many other causes that 
can lead someone to com-
mit terrorist actions. It’s not 
as if someone wakes up one 
morning, stumbles across a 
tweet that says “ISIS is great! 
Join today!” and makes the 
decision to become a terror-
ist. There have to be more fac-
tors, and maybe those deserve 
more attention.
However, just because 
there are other things that 
can be done to stop terrorism, 
doesn’t mean we should ig-
nore the role social networks 
play. It may seem mundane, 
but the hubbub over ISIS’s 
effective use of social media 
isn’t there for nothing. Maybe 
someone who isn’t inclined to 
join won’t ever be persuaded 
by some tweets, but terror-
ist groups do inspire and 
win over the people who feel 
angry or upset, and need a 
reason to ?ght. 
Most of those who join ter-
rorist groups from the United 
States and other western 
countries are middle-class, 
educated individuals that are 
enamored by radical promises 
of purpose and glory.
So how can we ?ght this? 
One idea was that the United 
States government should 
expand their Facebook 
presence. If social media is 
an effective tool for ISIS, it 
can also be an effective tool 
for our government. If people 
felt less disenfranchised and 
more as if they had a mean-
ingful connection to their own 
government, then maybe they 
would have less impetus to 
join terrorist groups.
And while it might be hard 
to enact this in a meaning-
ful way — there are stories 
of failed Russian schemes to 
create fake Facebook accounts 
that push pro-government 
opinions on social networks 
— just engaging more with 
citizens would make them less 
likely to defect. When ISIS and 
other terrorist groups push 
their ideology, we should 
provide a more positive 
alternative.
While this idea sounds 
practical and effective, it 
also raised a few concerns. Is 
?ghting ?re with ?re really a 
good idea? Pro-government 
social media accounts could 
be supporting the same kind 
of nationalistic fervor and us-
versus-them mentality that 
they’re trying to combat in the 
?rst place.
In conclusion, as long as 
we have the Internet, people 
will use it to convey terrible 
messages. ISIS and other ter-
rorist groups’ use of social me-
dia is the most recent area of 
concern. Whether by actively 
removing terrorists from so-
cial networks, undermining 
other factors that would en-
courage terrorism, drowning 
the messages out in oppos-
ing ideologies, or some other 
method, this problem has no 
easy answers.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This ar-
ticle is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on social media and 
terrorism.

One idea was that the United 
States government should expand 
their Facebook presence. If social 
media is an effective tool for ISIS, 
it can also be an effective tool for 
our government.
robot on an artistic task. The 
[Robot Art] competition was 
the perfect incentive.” After 
much deliberation, the team 
developed a haptic feedback 
system — a touch-sensitive 
system. The goal of this proj-
ect was to build a system 
where both a human and 
the robot could collaborate 
using only force feedback. 
“We thought that was a nov-
el method of collaboration 
that contrasted with existing 
computational creativity in-
terfaces,” Baraka said.
When asked about the 
idea of humanizing technol-
ogy, Baraka said that it was “a 
noble cause — dif?cult to do.” 
Much of the human-robot 
creative interaction that cur-
rently goes on is between the 
human artist and the robotic 
medium — such as Adobe’s 
Photoshop or InDesign, for 
instance. The human makes 
all of the choices and does 
all of the thinking within the 
constraints of the interface. 
The interface itself has only 
one role in the creative pro-
cess: to realize the human 
artist’s vision. 
Baraka and his team tack-
led the idea of humanizing 
their device when it came 
time to test its collaborative 
abilities. “We tried to evaluate 
differences between people 
who were told that they were 
collaborating with a com-
puter program controlling the 
robot and people who were 
deceived into thinking there 
was a human controlling the 
robot in another room.... peo-
ple had very different percep-
tions of the experience.”
The idea of perception 
seems to be integral to the 
future of more human-like 
robotics. While there may al-
ways be a difference between 
the organic human and the 
engineered, what can turn 
a tool into a collaborator is 
the perception of agency. If 
people believe that a robot is 
working under its own power 
and making its own decisions, 
based on some perceived ar-
tistic criteria, perhaps the 
person might view the robot 
as having a valid aesthetic 
and being capable of creating 
something meaningful. 
This goes back to one of 
the ideas behind arti?cial in-
telligence, that in order for 
something to be intelligent, 
it should have the ability to 
create and invent. In terms 
of speech, this might mean 
being able to hold its own in a 
conversation; in terms of art, 
this might mean painting a 
piece that makes people stop 
and think.
“It’s like teaching a walk-
ing robot to dance,” Conru 
said in an interview.
It’s an exercise in human-
robot interactions, in think-
ing about a robot as not just 
a tool or a medium, but as 
something that can inspire 
and possibly evoke emotion in 
humans. The Robot Art 2016 
initiative has two branches: 
telerobotics and fully au-
tomated robot interfaces. 
Telerobots are systems with 
which a person may interact 
in order to, say, paint. Fully 
automated systems func-
tion by themselves. There is 
great potential in both kinds. 
Telerobotics have the poten-
tial to assist the elderly or sick 
individuals with certain tasks, 
and the idea of full automa-
tion is very appealing to the 
idea of robots as agents. 
Ultimately, the Robot Art 
2016 competition is proving 
to be an exciting opportunity 
to unite great minds for a 
great purpose.

Kylie Jenner shouldn’t turn disability into accessory 
Last week, Interview magazine 
published a cover story on Kylie Jen-
ner, the youngest member of the 
Kardashian-Jenner family at 18 years 
old, featuring a photo shoot with 
Jenner in a stylized wheelchair. The 
photo, shot by Steven Klein, prompt-
ed instant backlash; many decried 
Jenner for taking something essen-
tial to many disabled people’s lives 
and making it a couture prop. 
Interview justi?ed the shoot by 
saying the wheelchair is a metaphor 
for Kylie’s life in the limelight — she 
is shackled by fame, and subjected to 
constant scrutiny. Jenner’s stint in a 
wheelchair serves as a weakly justi-
?ed societal commentary, and plays 
into the search for identity she says 
de?nes her coming of age. 
Although Kylie is still a teenager 
— “trying to ?gure herself out, ex-
perimenting with herself so that 
she might ?gure out who she is and 
who she wants to be,” in the words 
of Chris Wallace’s story for Interview 
— she should know better than to 
co-opt a wheelchair as a fashion ac-
cessory. As Jenner experiments with 
new looks in an effort to de?ne her-
self, she takes something that stig-
matizes those who are legitimately 
disabled, a wheelchair, and uses it as 
a tool for social gain and a spotlight. 
Disabled people have used Jen-
ner’s own anti-bullying hashtag cam-
paign, #IAmMoreThan, to express 
their outrage and show that they are 
more than their disabilities. Jenner 
has subverted her own anti-bullying 
values by appearing in a wheelchair, 
sending the message to disabled peo-
ple that disability is only worthy of a 
magazine cover when it’s appropri-
ate by someone able-bodied. 
The Tartan encourages Kylie and 
the whole Interview team to think 
more broadly about their fashion 
choices in the future. High-pro?le 
stories have the power to enforce or 
breakdown stigmas against already 
marginalized groups, and this pho-
toshoot failed to be conscious of its 
impact. 
American media creates overblown gun anxieties
BRANDON SCHMUCK
As headlines like “End the Gun 
Epidemic in America” become more 
common, Americans are growing 
increasingly afraid for their safety 
at work, school, and even in movie 
theaters. But has gun violence in 
America really gotten that much 
worse? While the media would like 
us to think that this is true, the de-
tails say otherwise.
According to a Washington Post 
article that went viral, “there have 
been 334 days and 351 mass shoot-
ings so far this year.” While this 
number initially seems insane, the 
de?nition of “mass shooting” is of-
ten disputed. The Washington Post 
took its data from the Mass Shooting 
Tracker, acknowledging that it “is 
different from other shooting data-
bases in that it uses a broader de?-
nition of mass shooting.” According 
to the FBI, a mass shooting involves 
four or more deaths. However, ac-
cording to the Mass Shooting Track-
er, a mass shooting occurs when 
four or more people are shot but not 
necessarily killed. Such a change 
greatly increases the number of re-
ported mass shootings, such as one 
that occurred in a nightclub where 
only one person was killed but many 
more were shot.
In order to analyze gun violence 
in America, we must look at more 
meaningful statistics, such as the de-
cline in gun-related deaths over the 
last twenty years. According to the 
Pew Research Center, ?rearm homi-
cides have nearly halved from 1993 
to 2013, from 7 to 3.6 homicides per 
100,000 people. The Washington 
Post attributes this decrease in vio-
lent crimes to more police of?cers, 
technology, and a decrease in alco-
hol consumption. Even the preva-
lence of mass shootings has not in-
creased substantially over the years. 
James Alan Fox, a criminologist at 
Northwestern University, claims 
that the rate of mass shootings has 
remained ?at overall since he start-
ed tracking it in the 1970s.
America has become a safer na-
tion over the last several decades. 
So why have we seen many more of 
these mass shooting headlines re-
cently? For one, shocking headlines 
get higher reader counts. A much 
more interesting statistic than the 
number of mass shootings by year 
would be the number of articles 
about mass shooting by year. The 
prevalence of violence was greater 
in the 1990s, but media coverage 
of such events was simply not any 
higher.
The media is instilling false fear 
in Americans. According to the 
Center for Disease Control, 11,208 
homicide deaths occurred in 2013. 
In comparison, heart disease, the 
leading cause of death in the United 
States, took 611,105 lives. However, 
a search through the USA Today ar-
chive shows how much larger media 
coverage of mass shootings (a frac-
tion of homicides) has become than 
heart disease. In total, there were 
1682 article results for “gun vio-
lence” and 1266 for “heart disease.” 
There were also more gun violence 
articles with shocking headlines 
that made the front page. Even 
though people are almost 60 times 
more likely to die of heart disease 
than homicide, they don’t walk the 
street worrying that they could have 
a heart attack any moment.
I do not deny that America has 
gun violence issues; it does. But gun 
violence is rooted more deeply into 
the history of America than the me-
dia coverage of a few recent mass 
shootings would lead us to believe. 
America has not entered a so-called 
“gun epidemic,” nor will it with any 
likelihood in the near future.
 If anything, America has had a 
gun-epidemic for generations. The 
prevalence of gun violence is de-
creasing in America, and though we 
still have a long way to go before gun 
violence can be ended altogether, 
we are in no more danger walking 
the streets than we were two de-
cades ago.

Voters need to ?ght against NRA, minimal gun laws  
After yet another mass shooting 
occurred this past week, this time in 
San Bernardino, Calif., the debate on 
gun control has been reinvigorated 
once again. While gun control itself 
is a contentious issue, piecemeal gun 
regulation often ends up out of the 
spotlight, allowing special interest 
groups like the NRA to spout (non-
sense) slogans like “the only way to 
stop a bad guy with a gun is a good 
guy with a gun!” and change the 
focus of the debate to gun bans and 
away from laws that absolutely have 
to be passed.
One of the more egregious exam-
ples of gun companies being given 
too much free reign is a 1996 budget 
bill that prevented the study of gun 
research by the CDC. Since then, the 
government is not even allowed to 
produce reports on gun control, let 
alone use the potential information 
to create good, informed laws. May-
be the data will ?nd that not every-
one has enough guns and everyone 
should be required to purchase ?ve 
automatic weapons with high-capac-
ity magazines and carry them at all 
times to defend themselves. Maybe 
research will say we should ban guns 
entirely. We have no way of knowing 
what information the government 
will produce and even the former 
congressman who pushed the provi-
sion, Jay Dickey (R-Ark.), considers 
his efforts a mistake. However, these 
lapses in the law just don’t go away.
Mandates from internal, non-
defaceable serial numbers to gun 
registries are just common sense. 
For the same reason we keep track of 
what license plate is on what insur-
ance plan, it is a good idea to keep 
track of what gun belongs to what 
person. Key Evidence in the argu-
ment against registries is Canada’s 
horribly run long-gun registry, cre-
ated in 1998. The record-keeping er-
rors and cost of hunting down every 
gun, considering that very old mod-
els were not even being made any-
more, caused costs to go through the 
roof. America’s larger pool of gun 
ownership and cultural differences 
between the U.S. and Canada will 
make it even harder to do a similar 
thing in America. However, this was 
a long-gun registry of shotguns and 
ri?es. Canada’s handgun registry 
is doing just ?ne, as is the handgun 
registry of every other high-income 
country in the world. The point is 
moot. Detractors may point to San 
Bernardino’s location in California, 
which has strict gun laws, but it’s so 
easy to just go to Nevada, get a gun, 
and drive it home that this particular 
response is meaningless. 
We don’t allow any other dan-
gerous machinery companies free 
range. You need a license — which 
requires af?rmative proof of capaci-
ty — to drive a car, operate construc-
tion equipment, and even open lem-
onade stands in some states. Why on 
earth would a gun, a machine explic-
itly designed for causing catastroph-
ic injuries, get a free pass?
Of course, the answer is the 
NRA’s full coffers — courtesy of gun 
corporations — and excellent PR 
department that shifts focus from 
meaningful steps in regulation to 
less-popular, full-blown gun control. 
But corporations don’t run the gov-
ernment unless we let them. Maybe 
the only way to stop a bad congress-
person with a gun lobby is a good 
citizen with a vote.
“America has not entered a so-called 
‘gun epidemic,’ nor will it with any 
likelihood in the near future. If anything, 
America has had a gun epidemic for 
generations.” 

---------------------------------------------------

“Dog whistle politics” and the “an-
gry black person” narrative are the 
2015 millennial form of racism. Tae-
gan Goddard explains dog whistle 
politics as “a type of political speech 
using code words that appear to 
mean one thing to the general popu-
lation but have a different meaning 
for a targeted part of the audience.” 
Dog whistle politics, alluding to a dog 
whistle that produces a high frequen-
cy sound that only dogs can hear, is 
used subliminally throughout media 
to express racism and prejudice to-
ward minorities.
Dog whistle politics happen every-
where — in politics, the media, and 
the workplace. But what surprises me 
is the prominent use of this tactic to 
disregard or invalidate the feelings of 
people of color at such a progressive 
and forward-thinking school as Carn-
egie Mellon. Even though I’ve only 
been a graduate student here for four 
months, I have already been a vic-
tim of these encoded words, such as 
when a student felt “uncomfortable” 
going to a party where the majority of 
people were black or when a profes-
sor asked me to give the “black per-
spective.” Too many black students, 
including myself, have been called 
“angry” or “sassy” for simply defend-
ing ourselves or speaking up against 
wrong-doings.
For example, in a group meeting 
for one of my projects, a classmate 
made a racist statement. In response, 
I told that classmate his statement 
was offensive. Instead of apologiz-
ing and correcting his statement, the 
classmate quickly called me “angry” 
and essentially told me to stop com-
plaining. If you’re reading this and do 
not understand why this situation is 
problematic, let me break it down.
Imagine someone calls your mom 
ugly. You try to explain to that person 
that their words are hurtful and you 
are offended. In response, this per-
son tells you to stop being angry and 
that the word “ugly” isn’t offensive, 
essentially invalidating your feelings.
Now, not every black person is an-
gry or sassy — if we were, we would 
have perfectly good reason to be, but 
that’s another topic for another arti-
cle. When you say minorities are an-
gry, sassy, or mad, all you’re doing is 
putting them in a box and furthering 
stereotypes. This method of labeling 
a black person creates a frustrating 
cycle for blacks that goes something 
like Example A.
Our emotions are essentially 
trapped and I strongly believe Carn-
egie Mellon is too supportive and 
progressive of a school to allow this 
to continue. So what can we all do to 
?x the problem? Instead of the cycle 
above, the offense could be a resolv-
able sequence like Example B.
Even if you are not the person 
offending, you could stick up for 
the person being offended. While 
we can’t always prevent insults, we 
should try our best to make Carnegie 
Mellon a safe and inclusive campus 
for all students.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: STUDENT VOICES ON MIZZOU
EMILY GALLAGHER
Junior Staffwriter
This past summer, I discovered the 
term “Millennial” and its many con-
notations. I was a local camp coun-
selor responsible for about twenty 
children. After a long day of running 
back and forth from the various ac-
tivities, the bathroom every ten min-
utes, and one trip to the nurse’s of-
?ce, I was completely exhausted. Just 
as I was about to leave, my manger 
told me: “Wow, you are not your typi-
cal Millennial.”
 At the time, I was slightly con-
fused and unsure whether her re-
mark was complimentary. I under-
stand better now, but I’m still unsure 
if I entirely agree with her use of the 
word.
“Millennial,” coined in 1991 as 
another name for Generation Y, has 
faced a signi?cant amount of con-
troversy. Technically speaking, it 
refers to those born between 1980 
and 2000. Older generations accuse 
Millennials of having no drive, never 
leaving their childhood homes, and 
being incompetent workers. 
They call Millennials lazy, unmo-
tivated, sel?sh, narcissistic, and a 
dozen other things that have given 
the term and the group a negative 
connotation. These stereotypes have 
been proven inaccurate time and 
time again, but the social stigma 
remains.
What older generations forget, 
however, is that a large majority of 
Millennials entered the workforce 
just as America was suffering its low-
est economic state since the Great 
Depression. Young people wanted to 
work, but there were few jobs to be 
found. They continued to live with 
their parents because they could not 
afford to move out on their own, due 
to both underemployment and an ab-
surd amount of college debt.
Recent studies have shown that 
over 70 percent of employers ?nd 
that Millennials are better equipped 
workers than the generation before 
them, with 82 percent commenting 
on the bene?ts of Millennials’ tech-
nology skills and quick adaptability. 
Millennials are also open-minded, 
which is something that too often 
goes unmentioned. 
They have been brought up to be 
more understanding and accepting of 
diversity than any previous genera-
tion. They are willing and able to not 
just coexist with people who are dif-
ferent from them, but to learn more 
about these differences and ?nd 
common ground despite them. This 
open-mindedness is the generation’s 
greatest strength.
Laura Olin, a member of Presi-
dent Obama’s 2008 campaign, said 
that “Millennials are wise enough to 
realize that no one is going to ?x the 
world for them — it’s up to them.” 
Like Olin, I too have faith that the 
world’s saving grace lies with this 
generation. 
So I suppose I have a right to be 
confused about my manager’s nega-
tive use of the word “Millennial.” The 
word de?nes this generation — a 
generation of artists, thinkers, col-
laborators, and innovators. In the 
end, despite the stereotypes, I am 
proud to be a part of it.

skill. Yet we sometimes fail to take 
responsibility for our teammates; 
instead, their issues are their own. 
For too long we have deemed our 
classmates’ lack of “success” as their 
personal problem. 
This is no different from calling 
racial inequality faced by black stu-
dents “their problem.” We have mis-
erably failed to see that problems 
faced by our peers are our problem 
as well. The success of the group 
is not based on one or a majority 
of its individual members, but the 
collective.
We should think the same way 
about injustices faced by people of 
color. Helping black students and 
being concerned about their issues 
does not cost you any negative re-
percussions. Helping someone that 
is falling behind in classes does not 
impede your ability to learn more. 
In fact, taking time to help someone 
with something they don’t under-
stand only helps you learn better. 
It seems as though it’s taboo to talk 
about two very relevant “B” words: 
black and blind. Well, I ?nally have 
the audacity to do so. Numerous 
students, faculty, and administra-
tors turn a blind eye to the fact that 
Carnegie Mellon poorly represents 
and treats black students.
Let’s ?rst consider the state of 
our university’s black students and 
faculty. There are more people that 
look like me in the dining locations 
and custodial roles than there are 
in my own classrooms. I can name 
all of the professors that are black, 
as I have had the privilege of being 
taught by all but two of the six pro-
fessors. In 2005, roughly 3.4 percent 
of tenured and tenure-eligible fac-
ulty was black. The numbers have 
steadily decreased ever since. In 
2013, roughly 1.8 percent Carnegie 
Mellon’s faculty was black. That’s a 
1.6 percent decrease in eight years. 
We need to do better. Carnegie Mel-
lon plays the diversity card as a way 
to attract more students and do-
nors, but how can we claim diversity 
when the statistics prove otherwise?
Maybe we should be more specif-
ic about what we mean by diversity. 
While the university may have many 
international students and students 
with a variety of academic interests, 
it certainly does not have a large 
amount of racial or ethnic diversity. 
The question now becomes why the 
black experience at Carnegie Mellon 
has not changed very much. Hon-
estly, I have no clue. But that doesn’t 
warrant the administration and 
non-black student body’s tendency 
to ignore the issue, which is why I 
demand that we earnestly consider 
how we got to where we are today 
and how to make rapid, signi?cant 
progress.
Everyone on campus must under-
stand that ignoring blackness and 
covert racism is, in fact, condoning 
it. A lack of care for our fellow peers 
and classmates is our collective is-
sue. As a community, we should feel 
responsible for the unpleasant expe-
riences of our classmates, especially 
black students. 
Standing up for issues faced by 
blacks is like a group project, where 
you are evaluated not just on your 
individual contribution but based on 
input from all members. Black stu-
dents can continue to ?ght against 
the injustices they face, but having 
non-black allies will result in more 
widespread and effective progress.

CMU doesn’t seem to care about systemic struggle of black students
A great man of action once said, 
“Education is our passport to the 
future, for tomorrow belongs to the 
people who prepare for it today.” 
That great man of action was El-Hajj 
Malik El-Shabazz, formally and most 
commonly known to the world as 
Malcolm X. 
I want to be able to travel to that 
future that Shabazz talks about, but 
how can I prepare for it if I am unsure 
whether or not the institution that 
is facilitating my “education” cares 
about me?
Several members of the Carnegie 
Mellon community have recently 
brought attention to the many racial 
issues that still exist on college cam-
puses around the country. However, 
no one seems willing to acknowledge 
how these issues continue to affect 
Carnegie Mellon’s black students. As 
a community, we have never really 
heard from the administration on 
whether the well-being and success 
of black students is a priority.
Black students in America have 
been systematically oppressed by 
the educational system. Those who 
are fortunate enough to be accepted 
into Carnegie Mellon slowly real-
ize that systemic oppression is still 
affecting them. Many of the black 
students here, including myself, 
come from inner-city schools. These 
schools have a history of providing 
subpar education and have the nerve 
to say that their “graduates” are pre-
pared for college. For a good portion 
of these students, going to college 
means escaping institutional racism, 
stemming from slavery, that corners 
them into the never ending cycle of 
poverty and struggle. 
However, even at a school as pro-
gressive as Carnegie Mellon, why 
are my black brothers and sisters 
and I still experiencing the same rac-
ism and indifference from students, 
faculty, and staff that our inner-city 
schools taught us were ended by the 
Civil Rights Movement?
Many incidents occur at Carnegie 
Mellon that just get swept under the 
rug by its amazing PR team or by 
students too afraid to speak up. The 
next time you see a black student on 
campus, ask them if they have expe-
rienced some form of racism here. I 
assure that you will be surprised by 
their answers. If more students be-
come aware of these racial issues, 
they will hopefully become more 
aware of other issues affecting stu-
dents.
Racism, sexism, sexual assault, 
and alcohol and drug abuse are just a 
few of the issues that continue to af-
fect many students on campus. How-
ever, the administration never really 
comes out and explicitly admits that 
these problems exist or that it will at-
tempt to solve them. Instead, the ad-
ministration is very quick to protect 
its image at the expense of the stu-
dents by making general statements 
about “diversity and inclusion” with-
out ever explaining what “diversity 
and inclusion” really means.
So I ask the administration: Do 
you care about the black students 
at Carnegie Mellon? Many of us are 
curious to know. And I am sure stu-
dents of other communities are cu-
rious as to whether you care about 
them as well. 
I will leave you with another 
quote from Mr. Shabazz: “Usually 
when people are sad, they don’t do 
anything. They just cry over their 
condition. But when they get angry, 
they bring about change.” Believe 
me when I say that if you carefully 
press your ear against the wall, you 
will hear many starting to get angry.

To save climate, leaders must cut toxic ties with industry
ALP MUYESSER
Junior Staffwriter
The most important climate con-
ference of the decade began this 
week in Paris. Analysts are hopeful 
that the results will end up being 
more productive than those from 
Copenhagen, and more binding than 
those from Kyoto, as politicians are 
?nally realizing that “business as 
usual” will mean the destruction of 
entire ecosystems, coastal towns, and 
in some cases, countries.
The science is quite clear: Exceed-
ing the two-degree global warming 
threshold will have catastrophic con-
sequences. At the world’s current rate 
of carbon consumption, we risk a ?ve 
degree increase in only a matter of 
decades. Though most of our carbon 
reserves would be better left perma-
nently underground, world leaders 
in Paris are challenging the scien-
ti?c consensus and debating how 
much carbon we still get to burn. The 
situation seems unpromising, if not 
downright depressing.
It seems unproductive, almost 
baf?ing, for politicians at a confer-
ence intended to save the planet from 
climate change to focus instead on 
making the fewest amount of conces-
sions while still maintaining a decent 
international reputation. Yet that is 
exactly what politicians arrived in 
Paris to accomplish.
Politicians, in most cases, rep-
resent power more than what they 
actually possess. And governments 
tend to represent the power of indus-
try, their symbiotic partner-in-crime, 
which feeds them the capital they 
desperately need to function. This 
pattern will stay ?xed unless there is 
a major social movement to change 
the game. International treaties pose 
no threat to the existing structure un-
less the governments that sign them 
are driven by the people and not cor-
porate interests.
Chances are that the Paris talks 
will be more conclusive and binding 
than previous climate treaties. It will 
also likely not be enough. 
The real battle will be fought on 
college campuses, the streets, and 
online — anywhere citizens can come 
together to challenge the conglom-
eration of government and industry 
that brought about the climate crisis. 
Progress will be made as far as it is 
demanded by the people. The climate 
movement will have to push harder. 
Our future as a species depends on it.
Low-income CMU music students don’t get fair chance to play
SINEAD FOLEY
Parents who dream of their ?ve-
year-old playing sonatas can bring 
them to Carnegie Mellon in the hope 
of lessons. Through an application 
and interview process, their child 
can become one of ten students ac-
cepted to the Beginning Piano pro-
gram, which trains children from 
the ages ?ve to seven. The bene?ts 
of childhood music training are well 
documented, and music education is 
a great way for the School of Music 
to give back to the Pittsburgh com-
munity. 
However, the cost of the Begin-
ning Piano program — and the dis-
tinct lack of ?nancial aid options — 
makes this education and its plethora 
of bene?ts inaccessible to children of 
lower socioeconomic status. The pro-
gram inadvertently ends up perpetu-
ating privilege and elitism instead of 
giving all kids a chance at learning 
classical music.
The caliber of Carnegie Mellon’s 
music program is well known. Lesser 
known around campus is the Music 
Preparatory School, which houses 
the Beginning Piano program and 
additionally trains kids from the ages 
four to 18 in piano, percussion, gui-
tar, and string instruments. 
Students in the general program 
take weekly private lessons at $85 
per hour, as well as a free elective. At 
around $900 per semester, the Be-
ginning Piano program is more com-
prehensive, including a 30-minute 
private lesson, a 45-minute group 
lesson, and a 45-minute Eurhythmics 
class, which non-music majors may 
know as the reason your music major 
friends spend exam week skipping 
around their dorms.
While Eurhythmics may seem 
odd from an outsider perspective, 
it is one of the cornerstones of mu-
sic education here at Carnegie Mel-
lon and is not offered at many other 
institutions. It teaches students 
how to better articulate themselves 
through music by feeling it with 
their whole bodies, and it has been 
proven to increase young children’s 
self-awareness.
The other bene?ts of the Prep 
School program are less unique to 
Carnegie Mellon and more widely 
researched. A study by the Boston 
Children’s Hospital found that mu-
sic training in early childhood im-
proved development in the areas 
of the brain that control executive 
functioning. According to head re-
searcher Nadine Gabb, “Since execu-
tive functioning is a strong predictor 
of academic achievement, even more 
than IQ, we think our ?ndings have 
strong educational implications.” 
Learning an instrument also helps 
with language processing. The Stan-
ford Report found that music training 
helps people detect small differences 
in syllables and the rapidly chang-
ing sounds that make up a language. 
Another study published in PLOS One 
found a correlation between at least 
three years of musical training and 
increased ?ne motor skills, vocabu-
lary, and nonverbal reasoning.
What all of this adds up to is that 
programs like the Music Preparatory 
School help students improve their 
reading and physical ability, expand 
their vocabulary, raise their aca-
demic performance, increase their 
problem solving ability — all in ad-
dition to gaining the ability to play 
an instrument. The rewards of these 
improved abilities are obvious in the 
Prep School’s student body. 
Dan Barrett, the director of the 
program, described its typical stu-
dent as an overachieving, Ivy League-
bound kid with 25 extracurriculars. 
Surprisingly, the students who seri-
ously apply themselves to the Prep 
School often do not go on to study 
music in college, because they ex-
cel in many ?elds. Barrett tied this 
academic success to their experience 
with music, and the bulk of scienti?c 
research backs him up.
However, the bene?ts of mu-
sic training may be even bigger, 
and arguably more important, for 
the groups that Carnegie Mellon 
has failed to serve. A 2014 study by 
Northwestern University found that 
students from impoverished back-
grounds experienced a greater abil-
ity to interpret speech after two years 
of music lessons as children. Under-
privileged youth often have dif?culty 
interpreting speech patterns pre-
cisely, which is a major contributor 
to the academic gap in performance 
between children from rich and poor 
backgrounds.
Academic performance is one of 
the few tickets to upward mobility, 
and the New York Times reported in 
September that the gap in earnings 
between those with and without a 
college degree is the largest it has 
ever been. Yet according to the same 
article, “only ?ve percent of Ameri-
cans ages 25 to 34 whose parents 
didn’t ?nish high school have a col-
lege degree.”
It’s vital to give children from un-
derprivileged backgrounds the skills, 
self-discipline, and self-con?dence 
necessary for college, and music 
education can provide that. Carn-
egie Mellon has not been idle in this 
important ?eld. Dr. Natalie Ozeas 
of the School of Music has created 
programs to get music exposure and 
education into Pittsburgh public 
schools, including an initiative to 
give keyboards to classrooms.
However, the Prep School remains 
unattainable for many. The $900 se-
mester cost for the Beginning Piano 
program in signi?cant, and the pro-
gram requires a commitment of four 
or ?ve semesters, adding up to about 
$3500. Most students in the program 
continue their study through middle 
or even high school; poorer students 
must do the same if they want to see 
the same bene?ts. This is can mean 
over $3000 per year for a family al-
ready struggling to pay the bills.
To be fair, this is how most univer-
sities run their music prep schools. 
However, Carnegie Mellon can and 
should break the pattern. The ben-
e?ts of ?nancial aid options are clear 
for underprivileged students, but 
there are also bene?ts for all of the 
students and the program at large. 
Having students from different back-
grounds in the group lessons will al-
low all the children to hear about dif-
ferent perspective and experiences, 
and offering scholarships will help 
break the elitism so common in clas-
sical music programs.
It will not be easy for the Prep 
School to create scholarship options. 
The program is currently completely 
self-funded, and the resources of-
fered to students are impressive and 
therefore expensive. 
Nonetheless, the program should 
make it a priority to offer at least 
one full-ride scholarship through 
the entirety of their piano program, 
as well as a few partial scholarships. 
Carnegie Mellon has a chance to be 
at the forefront of equal access to mu-
sic education, and we should take up 
the challenge. We want the best and 
brightest students — from all back-
grounds.

ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
Just before the season, 
I picked out four teams I 
thought might have surprising 
seasons – two teams whose 
fortunes might turn from the 
previous season and two who 
might make a surprise trip to 
the Super Bowl. Exactly none 
of the four predictions panned 
out. Here I’ll look into what I 
had wrong and why these pre-
dictions didn’t work.
Minnesota Vikings
I had the Minnesota Vikings 
improving dramatically from 
last season. However, almost 
immediately after the writing 
of that article, the Vikings lost 
right tackle Phil Loadholdt 
for the season, making the 
right side of the offensive line 
a major weak point heading 
into the season. Add in quar-
terback Teddy Bridgewater’s 
struggles in his second season 
trying to get the ball down?eld 
combined with a series of re-
ceivers who are at their best 15 
or more yards down the ?eld, 
and it’s clear that this offense 
is a work in progress.
It’s possible the Viking’s 
defense has also been a key 
factor in its improvement in 
record this season, but they’ve 
struggled against the run 
and cornerbacks Terrance 
Newman and Trae Waynes 
have struggled to lock down 
number two receivers. Due 
to cornerback Xavier Rhodes 
eliminating most number one 
receivers, that pair has been 
picked on a lot. The lineback-
ing corps has been excellent, 
but passes and runs to the out-
side have caused signi?cant 
struggles for the second level 
of this defense. If they can ?nd 
a cornerback-safety combina-
tion on the roster to comple-
ment Rhodes and safety Harri-
son Smith, this could be a top 
level defense, but in its current 
form it is de?nitely beatable.
The Vikings are 8–3 with 
a surprising lead in the NFC 
North, but they really have not 
been close to as good as their 
record this season. They con-
tinuously look unable to move 
the football and simply eke by 
bad teams. They were blown 
out in week one by the San 
Francisco 49ers, who are foot-
ball’s worst team. The Vikings 
should look to use the rest of 
the season to build an offense 
more conducive to their quar-
terback’s talents — namely his 
pinpoint midrange accuracy 
and his stunning poise under 
pressure — to improve down 
the stretch.
Denver Broncos
This team, like the Vikings, 
is nowhere near as good as 
its 9–2 record might suggest. 
They slipped by in each of their 
?rst 6 games, winning by an 
average of six points and win-
ning only one game by more 
than seven. They really should 
have come out of that stretch 
3–3 and not 6–0, but those 
wins are banked. After sur-
prisingly dominating the Pack-
ers (who have seen their own 
struggles since that game), 
the Broncos offense has ticked 
up to match their dominant 
defense. The reasons for the 
struggles of the offense were 
largely the scenario laid out in 
my predictions. The offensive 
line has meshed terribly and 
quarterback Peyton Manning 
is ?nally too old to play foot-
ball. However, that defense 
led by linebacker Von Miller 
has been so good, they picked 
up the slack. The Broncos 
have also replaced Manning 
with quarterback Brock Os-
weiler who has been mediocre 
— a huge improvement over 
Manning’s disastrous perfor-
mance. After a referee-provid-
ed win against New England, 
the Broncos now have four 
wins they have banked despite 
being thoroughly outplayed 
by their opposition. However, 
as the offense improves and 
the defense continues to de-
stroy hopeless opposing quar-
terbacks, this team could be a 
scary sight come the playoffs.
Dallas Cowboys
It’s not too hard to ?gure 
out why Dallas went from pos-
sible Super Bowl contention 
to bottom feeder. The predic-
tion was based on the idea 
that running back DeMarco 
Murray was not actually that 
important to this team and 
the success was due to his of-
fensive line. That turned out 
to be true as running back Jo-
seph Randle found plenty of 
success before losing his job to 
running back Darren McFad-
den, who also has played very 
well. However, quarterback 
Tony Romo and wide receiver 
Dez Bryant — both of whom 
are top three players at their 
position — have been injured 
for basically the entire season. 
Romo clearly had not healed 
from his broken collarbone 
before he came back, and now 
it’s broken again and he is out 
for the season, while Bryant 
does not have his usual burst. 
Without them, the offense has 
been helpless. The defense has 
improved, but their improve-
ment from bad to subpar does 
not make up for the loss of 
their two best players. Even 
with a weak NFC East, this de-
pleted Dallas roster won’t sniff 
the Super Bowl this season.
Indianapolis Colts
The Colts will make the 
playoffs this year based on 
their bad division, but they 
don’t deserve to. Quarterback 
Andrew Luck has missed lots 
of time with lacerations to his 
kidney, but the Colts looked 
horrible with him on the ?eld. 
Backup quarterback Matt 
Hasselback has been okay in 
Luck’s place, but that’s all. 
The defensive moves general 
manager Ryan Grigson made 
actually worked, and the Colts 
defense has improved from 
disastrous last year to being 
pretty much league average 
this year. On the other hand, 
the offense has been abso-
lutely unable to do anything. 
The offensive line has been a 
nightmare and running back 
Frank Gore subsequently has 
holes to hit on offense.
Neither Luck nor Hassel-
back has had any time to throw 
and have struggled to hit any 
receivers. With the offense 
failing completely, an average 
defense has managed to keep 
this team hovering at .500, but 
winning the AFC South is not 
what the Colts had in mind be-
fore this season. 
At 6–5, there is still time 
for the Colts to right the ship. 
They have the talent to suc-
ceed offensively and make a 
deep playoff run. However, 
a season that began with Su-
per Bowl aspirations is likely 
to end in divisional round as 
the Colts are steamrolled by 
a team that actually earned a 
playoff spot.

As we all know, my loy-
alty to my favorite player is 
as ?ckle as fantasy football 
itself. And as much as I loved 
Jeremy Langford two weeks 
ago, his moment in the lime-
light is over. He still scored 
nine points in week 11 and 
10 points on the Thanksgiv-
ing Day return of Matt Forte. 
While that’s not nothing, it’s 
much less than the 29 points 
that made me fall in love with 
Langford, that big teddy bear. 
(Get it? Bear?)
The real star of my heart 
right now is Russell Wilson. 
In week 11, he had his ?rst 
three-touchdown game of 
the season and threw for 260 
yards. This all amounted to a 
25-point week, his best of the 
season. I still lost to Team “the 
bo jacks” 69–62. So that was 
pretty funny.
Week 12 was very interest-
ing. Seattle Seahawks versus 
Pittsburgh Steelers. Team Ya 
Gurl Gutie versus team Bofa 
Deez Nuts. Russell Wilson ver-
sus Ben Roethlisberger. And 
as fate and luck would have it, 
the Seahawks, Ya Gurl Gutie, 
and Russell Wilson came out 
on top. Roethlisberger may 
have scored 21 points, not 
bad, but my best friend and 
the love of my life Russell Wil-
son put up 34 points. Wilson 
actually scored a career-high 
?ve touchdowns.
His spectacular game cata-
pulted me and my team to the 
victory over Bofa Deez Nuts, 
82–69.
This week, he’s got a pretty 
tough match-up against the 
Vikings — ranked sixth in 
points allowed to opposing 
quarterbacks — which has 
undermined my con?dence a 
little bit. My backup quarter-
back Matt Cassel also seems 
like a solid choice now that 
Tony Romo is out. I do worry 
that the Cowboys could have 
an awesome week, resulting 
in a disappointing bench-
player-outscoring-starter mis-
hap. But Wilson is on a roll. 
For now, I’ll have to stay loyal 
— but just this once.
I also feel the need to send 
some love Eric Decker’s way. 
So far this season he’s scored 
a touchdown in eight out of 
his ten starts, and six of those 
have been double-digit per-
formances. I was wary about 
him for a little while because 
he’s had a knee injury since 
week three, but in spite of that 
he’s continued to surprise and 
impress me. Decker has con-
sistently carried my team, and 
for that I am forever grateful.
This week is the last regu-
lar season matchup before the 
playoffs. Unfortunately there 
is just no way I’ll make it. Only 
the top four teams out of the 
league’s 20 will advance, so 
the odds were dif?cult to be-
gin with.
Team M and “Church 
League Fist?ght!!!” both have 
11–1 records, snagging two of 
the playoff spots, and next in 
line are the three teams with 
8–4 records. This week will 
decide which two get to ad-
vance. Still, I’m pretty proud 
of my 7–5 record.
At least I’ll ?nish the sea-
son above .500. And even if I 
won’t win the Shiva, at least I 
won’t win the Sacko.
On another positive note, 
it looks like I should be able 
to ?nish the season off with a 
victory.
My opponent Team Har-
vey is still starting Joe Flacco, 
who tore his ACL two weeks 
ago. I feel pretty con?dent 
that I’ll have the advantage at 
quarterback.
However, we are fairly 
evenly matched in everything 
else. At running back, I’ve got 
the dream team of LeGarette 
Blount and Jeremy Langford, 
who both have favorable 
match-ups. DeMarco Murray 
and Lamar Miller are better 
running backs, but they have 
harder match-ups. Hopefully 
this will even out the score to 
keep the de?cit minimal.
At wide receiver, we both 
have one really good player 
— Decker for me and Jarvis 
Landry for Harvey — and one 
less reliable but sometimes 
awesome player — Dwayne 
Harris for me, and Devin 
Funchess for him.
If I had known there was 
a player whose last name is 
Funchess, I de?nitely would 
have tried to draft him, so I’m 
slightly disappointed in my-
self.
I ended up starting Harris 
over Pierre Garcon this week 
because, now that DeSean 
Jackson is back, Garcon just 
hasn’t been as productive of 
a player.
I’m also getting the sense 
that tight ends just never 
score more than 10 points un-
less they’re Rob Gronkowski. 
So I’ve just stopped being con-
cerned about the ?ve points 
Jared Cook may or may not 
score. It feels like a waste of 
my worry.
I do feel good about the D/
ST match-up, Jets versus Ra-
vens. ESPN Fantasy called the 
Raven’s pass defense “porous” 
and while I don’t know what 
that means, it sounds good for 
me and also makes me giggle. 
I don’t know why. The Jets 
are facing the Giants in a New 
York brawl which might not 
be easy, but at least the Jets 
aren’t porous.
Brandon McManus, who 
I used to adore, has contin-
ued to disappoint me, but 
I’ll direct that blame toward 
the Broncos. Yet while they 
have been struggling recent-
ly, things could look up this

Chargers, who are 3–8 for the

opportunities for McManus to 
put up points.

Junior defensive end Brian 
Khoury sets the edge when it 
comes to balancing the Carn-
egie Mellon academic life with 
football. Khoury has shown 
con?dence in dominating in 
both ?elds: taking on the chal-
lenges of an electrical and 
computer engineering (ECE) 
major and a heavy football 
practice schedule and com-
ing out on top. This season 
he was well rewarded, being 
recognized as the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) de-
fensive player of the year and 
an Academic All-American. 
Perhaps the best reward, how-
ever, was helping the Men’s 
Football team to its ?rst UAA 
championship in 10 years.
On and off the ?eld, Khoury 
looks to maintain his success-
ful lifestyle and inspire his 
teammates and supporters to 
follow. Courses can frequently 
get tough, and a huge chal-
lenge to managing the football 
double life requires athletes to 
push through late nights and 
practices and stay with it all.
Khoury speaks to the bal-
ance of keeping practices light 
and fun, while maintaining the 
focus needed to be successful. 
“[Y]ou look around you see ... 
guys pretty tired and you were 
with them last night at 2, 3 
a.m. doing a problem set. And 
yeah, it’s a tough situation but 
you just ?nd a way to enjoy it,” 
Khoury said. “Or at least enjoy 
it until it happens next Thurs-
day when the problem set’s 
due again.”
With the added workload 
off the ?eld, keeping a good 
handle on the situation is key 
to a well-rounded college ex-
perience, both for the team 
and individually as a student 
and an athlete.
When away from the team, 
Khoury balances spending 
time with teammates, other 
friends he has through clubs, 
other sports teams, and class-
es. Khoury initially competed 
with Carnegie Mellon Solar 
Splash racing his freshman 
year, something that really 
opened him up to the impact 
of his work.
“[W]hen we made our 
boat, we went to Europe — our 
boat broke down, of course — 
and we were on the side of this 
canal in the Netherlands and 
this whole group of eight to 10 
year-old kids came up and they 
thought we were rock stars.” 
Although Khoury has partici-
pated in Solar Race team and 
The Tartan Athlete Fellowship 
clubs in the past, he emphasiz-
es the importance of making 
sure not to over-extend.
“If you can ?nd something 
you enjoy and ... it’s worth 
the grind and the process get-
ting there, embrace it; go for 
it,” he said. Doing what you 
care about well is not only 
personally rewarding, as il-
lustrated by Khoury’s experi-
ence in the Netherlands, but 
can be broadly in?uential both 
within the team and beyond. 
Taking care of responsibili-
ties helps Khoury set a good 
example on the team, as he 
works with other athletes who 
have to learn to perform even 
under dif?cult conditions, but 
Khoury’s experience in Europe 
is informative of the real-
world repercussions his work 
can have.
Being on the team is a two-
way relationship for Khoury. 
On top of the contributions he 
works to make, the team gives 
Khoury a great support group, 
with teammates to work with, 
eat lunch with, and work 
through injuries with. Being a 
part of the team, “It helps with 
girls,” Khoury laughs. But, he 
explains, the joke isn’t really 
such a joke at all. He and his 
teammates do look out for 
each other and advise each 
other all the time.
Even during the busiest se-
mesters in ECE, including this 
one, Khoury can ?nd time to 
relax with other guys on the 
team, if only for a meal. Pull-
ing aside for lunch on campus, 
or if there’s time getting out 
for the luxury of some good 
Pittsburgh chicken wings, 
means that at the busiest times 
there still is a time to step back 
and enjoy the situation.
He does not say that home-
work with teammates isn’t 
enjoyable. “Guys are giving 
me a hard time about Oreos,” 
Khoury said. “They were pick-
ing on me ‘cause I said Oreos 
weren’t that good. They’re 
okay but they’re like the 
Notre Dame of snack cook-
ies. They’re decent but they’re 
overrated.” Sometimes, do-
ing homework on a Thursday 
night can leave anyone a tar-
get for getting a little too com-
fortable in his or her shoes.
So what has changed for 
the football team this season? 
Khoury explains how the ex-
citement and the con?dence 
built up this season after each 
next win and brought out a 
team that could control the 
tension between excitement 
with where the team was and 
the need for focus on the task 
at hand. While they made the 
best of the ride, guys on the 
roster stepped up in their roles 
and played their play week 
to week to help get Carnegie 
Mellon on top.
During the week, it’s al-
ways a goal for the team to 
keep practices consistent, but 
the energy de?nitely showed 
up. Khoury commends the 
team for the discipline they 
had early in the season, pull-
ing their situation together 
after a 1–3 start and staying 
away from any internal strug-
gles. Instead of pointing ?n-
gers, players stayed on top of 
their own game contributions 
and got the team into the win 
column, and kept them there.
Khoury gets back in action 
next fall with the start of the 
Tartan’s title defense, but for 
now, he’ll put in the work ev-
eryday that gets him ready to 
play at a high level.
Women’s basketball overcomes slow start to top Oberlin
IAN TANAYA
Asst. Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team played 
Oberlin College on Saturday. 
The hard-fought contest end-
ed in a 73–64 win for the Tar-
tans, improving their record 
to 6–0 for the season.
Oberlin got off to a 5–0 
start before the Tartans made 
their ?rst basket. Though the 
Yeowomen were able to get 
off to a fast start, junior guard 
Jackie Hudepohl’s scoring 
helped the Tartans close the 
gap during the course of the 
?rst period. The Tartans even 
managed to take the lead a 
few times before the quarter 
?nished with a 14–14 tie.
In the second quarter, 
Oberin once again worked 
up a lead, this time keeping 
a tight defense against the 
Tartans.
Junior center and forward 
Lisa Murphy kept the Tartans 
a?oat during the period, get-
ting the Tartans through their 
largest de?cit of nine points 
and keeping the game much 
closer at 36–33 Oberlin going 
into halftime.
The third quarter saw 
Oberlin extend their lead 
with a few three-point shots. 
Senior forward Liza Otto con-
tributed to much of the Tar-
tans’ scoring in the period, 
and Murphy was able to get 
open for plenty of two-point 
baskets as the Tartans came 
back. After taking the lead 
with two minutes to go, Ober-
lin came back with another 
three-point ?eld goal, but the 
Tartans were able to retake 
the lead after a foul gave Mur-
phy the chance to make some 
free shots. The Yeowomen 
had a chance to tie the game 
at the end of the period, but 
the Tartans got the rebound 
and managed to get one more 
score out of it, closing the pe-
riod with a 58–53 lead.
The Yeowomen got off to 
a quick start in the ?nal peri-
od, tying up the game before 
Murphy made another basket. 
Several lead changes ensued 
as both teams refused to let 
up. In the last two minutes, 
the Tartans found themselves 
with a sizable lead and man-
aged to burn quite a bit of 
time as they continued to add 
more breathing space. At 30 
seconds, the Yeowomen were 
desperate to extend game 
time by fouling after earning 
a three-point ?eld goal. How-
ever, the Tartans were able to 
recover the ball after Oberlin 
failed to score again, ?nally 
?nishing off the Yeowomen.
Though the offense took a 
while to truly get going, the 
Tartans turned out another 
strong performance. Murphy 
led the way for the team with 
28 points and 12 rebounds. 
Otto earned 15 points and 
four rebounds, Hudepohl got 
13 points and eight rebounds, 
and senior guard Lindsay Poss 
notched 10 points and seven 
rebounds.
Although the Tartans 
played from behind during 
much of the game, they were 
able to pull through and end 
up on top by a fair margin. 
“It was really great to come 
back,” Murphy said after the 
game. “Coming back shows 
a lot of mental toughness in 
the team.” The defensive ef-
fort helped keep the de?cits 
to manageable levels before 
the offense ?nally got going. 
“Our defense brought home 
the win.” Although the Tar-
tans will face their next six op-
ponents on the road, Murphy 
has con?dence that the team 
will be strong enough to earn 
a number of wins during the 
stretch.
The Tartans will next 
take on Bethany College on 
Monday.

Time to jam to holiday tunes
As the winter holidays loom closer, listen to these favorites
I grew up in a household that was particular about when 
and where holiday music could be played: from after 
Thanksgiving Day to Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Because 
of this, I am always excited about the season in which I 
can listen to some of my favorite carols and holiday tunes 
without being scorned by my parents. Each holiday 
album and song reminds me of December memories 
throughout the years, and gives me that semi-awkward 
wistful look that always looks beautiful in movies, but is 
weird to see on people’s faces in real life.
Here are some of my favorite things to listen to on the 
days when the days are short and all you want to do is 
drink your weight in hot cocoa, snuggle, watch Love 
Actually multiple times, and eat mashed potatoes at any 
given opportunity.
Pentatonix’s That’s Christmas To Me
It could be my enduring love for Kevin Olusola, this 
a cappella group’s beatboxer, but 2014’s best-selling 
Christmas album was super popular for a reason. As 
much as I love solo renditions of the classics, the small 
chamber vocal arrangements on this album are refreshing 
to the ears. Having been used to choral arrangements 
of church carols, and the mellow timbre of the likes of 
Michael Bublé for the poppier tunes, Pentatonix offers 
an interesting halfway point between the two common 
types. I love their “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing” and 
their “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy,” but they also have 
a mushy gushy original tune, “That’s Christmas To Me,” 
which I love.
Last year my parents bought me the album as an 
early Christmas present, and also to fuel my — and 
their — obsession with Kevin Olusola. We listened to it 
multiple times on our annual cross country car trip to my 
grandparents’ house. If you didn’t have the chance to 
hear this last year, or weren’t paying attention as it played 
constantly in the background during long Barnes & Noble 
shopping trips, it is totally worth rocking out to this year.
A Taste of Chanukah
I listen to this album once a year. Growing up as a 
demi-Jew (half-Jewish), my winter holidays tend to be 
an amalgamation of the two holidays. One of my favorite 
traditions in my family is listening to this variety album of 
Chanukah tunes while decorating the family Christmas 
tree, complete with the Star of David perched on the top. 
Being a Boston native as well, this Boston-centric album 
is a wonderful taste — no pun intended — of various 
Chanukah traditions. Featuring ensembles from New 
England Conservatory and around Boston, songs are 
sung in various languages with different styles and vibes. 
The album opens with “Oy Chanukah,” an English and 
Yiddish take on the classic. Throughout the album there 
are more classic songs, like “Ikh Bin a Kleyner Dreydl,” 
(a German variant of “I have a little dreydl”), as well as 
psalms, and a comedic latke cooking demonstration. 
Chanukah is the celebration of a miracle, and the comic 
energy and general lightheartedness make this album a 
great addition to the holiday celebrations.
Josh Groban’s Noël
Josh Groban has the wonderful talent of being at once 
humorous, and also soothing. Though by no means a 
favorite singer of mine, Josh Groban’s Christmas album 
Noël is a great sing-along opportunity, if you are into 
belting loudly and dramatically with friends and family. 
To me, singing carols and other songs with friends is 
a wonderful and relaxing way to spend an evening, 
particularly if you’re stuck together in a small space — a 
car for instance — traversing slowly through a semi-scary 
snow storm and trying very hard not to skid on the ice. Be 
very careful though, as it is important to pay attention to 
others in the car when engaging in a sing-a-long, because 
there is nothing less fun than being stuck in a place where 
there is a sing-a-long happening that you are not into. 
And Christmas is no time to start fights.
Ella Fitzgerald’s Ella Wishes You A Swinging 
Christmas
One of the great vocalists of her time, this album from 
1960 is still one of my favorite holiday music choices. 
Her renditions of songs such as “The Christmas Song” 
and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” add just 
enough embellishment and jazzy calmness to make 
them interesting and joy-inducing. I think her voice is 
extraordinarily beautiful, and I’d basically choose to listen 
to it all the time, if I could. For whatever the reason, I seem 
to have a mental block when it comes to memorizing the 
lyrics to multiple verses of Christmas carols, whereas I can 
unwillingly recite all the lyrics to Katy Perry’s “Firework.” 
Fitzgerald’s album is a great place to re-learn some of 
those words you forgot, so you don’t embarrass yourself in 
front of all your cousins when you gather ‘round the piano’ 
later.
Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You”
To be honest, I’ve never listened to the album that 
this classic holiday song came off of in 1994. It’s called 
Merry Christmas, and I’m going to try to make a point 
of listening to it over break this year. However, almost 
everyone loves this song. In high school, my friend David 
Julien listened to this song every day starting from the 
beginning of October until March, conservatively, which 
was pretty weird. But because of that, this song makes 
me quite nostalgic and is also a good song to dance 
to. I personally don’t find this song amazing, but it just 
wouldn’t be Christmas without Mariah Carey crooning in 
the back of my mind.
Regardless of what you choose to listen to this Christmas, 
I hope that the holidays are very fun. For those who 
prefer instrumental Christmas music, there is a wealth of 
beautiful options. If you prefer to listen to get your holiday 
groove on to the impassioned and tortured vocals of Three 
Days Grace or Green Day, feel free, as long as you are 
happy.

Advice for awkward people
Hey, Josh!
I have a bit of a problem. 
My girlfriend of two years 
broke up with me recently 
because, among other 
things, she didn’t like how 
much of a dreamer I am. 
I’ll admit, my head is in the 
clouds, but I never thought 
that it was a bad thing until 
now. Nowadays, I think that 
I have displaced all of my 
emotions onto someone 
else, and this crush — if 
you can call it that — has 
built this person up such 
that the reality isn’t even 
close to the picture in my 
head. She is intelligent and 
successful and someone 
whom I admire very much. 
I can very plainly see that 
this person doesn’t like me, 
but in my mind, I can’t stop 
thinking about how good 
we’d be together, and how 
much I really wish that she 
liked me in return. I’m also 
aware that the version of 
her I like is not the version 
that exists in the world — I 
have built the idea of her up 
so much that it’s unrealistic, 
and that’s my problem. 
I know in my head that 
this will most likely never 
work, but there is always 
that hope; and every time 
I convince myself that 
I am over it, that it was 
not a good idea, I see 
her somewhere, in line at 
Entropy, or around Baker, 
and my old crushy feelings 
come roaring back. 
What do I do? How do I 
ground myself back into 
reality and stop all of this 
blushing and stammering 
and dreaming? How do I 
get my feet back on the 
ground?
Signed,
Putting Up with Disastrous 
Dreams of Intimacy, 
Nausea, and Giggles.
Dear PUDDING,
First of all, I’m very sorry about 
the breakup. Secondly, I want 
to make it clear that being a 
dreamer and an idealist are 
not bad character traits, nor 
anything to be ashamed of. 
Unfortunately, there really isn’t 
a way to just logically stop all 
of these feelings. Your best bet 
is to either avoid her entirely 
or to actually get to know her. 
In one scenario, you might 
forget about her and have a 
clean break, and in the other, 
there are two options: Either 
you both hit it off and have a 
grand old life, or you begin to 
see the disconnect between 
the version of this person that 
you’re so attracted to, and you 
realize the difference between 
what she is (the reality) and 
what you want her to be (your 
concept of her). The blushing 
and stammering and dreaming 
are all par for the course, but 
the best thing you can do 
for yourself is either let this 
crush die of natural causes 
and take some time to heal, 
or to pursue it and see what 
happens.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown

---------------------------------------------------

pillbox 12.07.15
Two years after dropping his ?rst independent album, 
rapper G-Eazy sold out his ?rst solo show in 2014. 
Following this skyrocket to fame was his second album, 
These Things Happen, which exuded Bay Area pride 
and deliberated on his newfound recognition. The 
album, which remained at the top of charts for a full 
year, featured top hits such as “I Mean It” and “Almost 
Famous” which highlight G-Eazy’s reservations about 
how long he will be able to hold onto the spotlight. 
Will he stay relevant? Can he handle a solo tour and 
make a name for himself? The open-ended set up and 
introspective vibe of this second album laid out a solid 
platform on which a highly anticipated follow-up album, 
with the answer to all of these questions, could be built.
When It’s Dark Out, G-Eazy’s third album, does not 
disappoint. The album, which dropped last Thursday, 
is very much a continuation of G-Eazy’s musings about 
his newly acquired fame and fortune. The featured 
artist line-up for When It’s Dark Out, though lengthy, is 
arguably much better than previous albums. The album 
features Big Sean, Chris Brown, Tory Lanez, Keyshia 
Cole, and E-40, to name a few.
The album’s intro track samples a beat used several 
times throughout this album and These Things Happen, 
which creates a nice cohesion between his past albums 
and the songs on this particular album. The intro track 
features G-Eazy singing the words to the poem “Do Not 
Go Gentle Into That Good Night” by Dylan Thomas. The 
seriousness and almost eerie vibe of the intro sets the 
stage for a more serious album.
The ?rst song, “Random,” previously released as a single, 
has a classic G-Eazy vibe — medium paced rapping 
with the occasional, frustrated yelling, and a mildly to 
severely cocky demeanor. Although the featured artists 
on the album are quite good, it was nice to see G-Eazy 
start off the album with a statement song that was true 
to his style and featured his voice alone. The slightly 
boastful “Random” highlights the hard work that G-Eazy 
has put into his success thus far in his career, and 
focuses speci?cally on how recent events and efforts 
have pushed him into the spotlight.
“Me, Myself, & I,” the third song on the album, gives us a 
meditative look at G-Eazy’s success. The premise of the 
song is plain and simple: Would his friends really be here 
if he weren’t famous? This theme is seen throughout 
the album, especially on songs “Sad Boy,” “Don’t 
Let Me Go,” and “For This.” These themes highlight 
G-Eazy’s struggle between loving fame and wanting to 
be surrounded by people who love more than just his 
success.
Within the next two or three songs, you can really start 
to see that this album is going to be more personal 
than his previous two. “Drifting,” an R&B crossover 
track featuring Tory Lanez and Chris Brown, talks about 
G-Eazy’s simultaneous drift toward fame and away 
from the woman he loves. This is another reoccurring 
theme in the album — G-Eazy is surrounded by beautiful 
women because of this fame and success, but none of 
them is who he really wants. The mixing of an almost 
confused, pondering G-Eazy with this classic cocky rap 
style creates a dynamic and quite enjoyable album. It’s 
almost like G-Eazy was in the middle free styling, took 
a step back and asked himself, “Is this really who I am 
now?”
The song “Sad Boy” is a perfect example of this confused 
side of G-Eazy. During the song, he is asking himself 
why he is unhappy, even though he is living a lavish 
lifestyle which many envy. This song undeniably signals 
a transition in the mood of the album. If you came to 
When It’s Dark Out in the search of feel-good, hyped up 
vibes similar to recent releases like “Forbes” and “I Mean 
It,” then you’re de?nitely going to want to stay within 
the ?rst half of the album.
The latter half of the album features some really personal 
moments for G-Eazy about love, family, fame, and the 
sheer act of balancing it all without losing himself. In 
“Think About You,” he talks about the inner con?ict of 
deciding whether or not to reach out to a lost love. He 
doesn’t want to hurt her by reaching out and opening 
up old wounds, but the last things he wants to do is hurt 
her by ignoring her. In “Everything Will Be OK,” featuring 
R&B and hip-hip singer-songwriter Kehlani Parrish, we 
see a vibe from G-Eazy that is more personal, in which 
he discusses not only this lost love, but the love lost 
between his parents. The song is ?ve minutes of chills 
and pure heartache, but you simply can’t turn it off.
The honesty and reality of this album is refreshingly 
deep. Many of the songs on When It’s Dark Out are 
far more relatable than his popular singles about 
making it big, selling out shows in Europe, and buying 
Lamborghinis. The album show a more mature, 
con?dent rapper. Songs “Nothing To Me” and “For This” 
show a side of G-Eazy that is far less concerned with 
abiding by mainstream rap and the opinions of others, 
and far more concerned with telling a powerful story 
through quality music.
Even though the album does feature a mellower, more 
personal touch, G-Eazy fans can rest assured that 
the rapper’s classic boastful rapping style still has a 
strong presence, most notably in “You Got Me,” a song 
previously released as a single, and “One Of Them,” 
which essentially outlines a list of things that G-Eazy 
would like — or perhaps is demanding — one of.
All things considered, When It’s Dark Out is a quality 
album. G-Eazy stayed true to himself, while still 
managing to successfully create a strong dynamic 
between someone who is both con?dent and confused. 
Although some of the featured artists seem to be an odd 
combination with the rapper, and the quantity of artists 
featured on the album seems a bit excessive, most of the 
songs were good, many of them great, and a few were, 
in my opinion, fantastic. The contemplative vibe from 
his second album remains strong in the third album, and 
the listener still ends with the same, persistent question: 
“Where does G-Eazy go from here?”

Justin gains more beliebers with new music
With a new look, different musical taste, and better attitude, Bieber garners the approval of many
It seems like just yesterday a young Canadian boy 
from YouTube was telling us one time that we were 
the girl of his prepubescent dreams. A lot of time has 
passed since then, and we’ve watched Justin Bieber 
go from a kid in a purple hoodie with hair in his eyes 
to kind of a tool. From getting arrested for a DUI to 
leaving a monkey in another country, J-Biebs seems 
to have done it all. Just when it seemed like things 
couldn’t get any better for the singer, he made a 
turnaround reminiscent of Britney Spears circa 2007 
following his roast on Comedy Central. He apologized 
for acting like such a brat, but who could blame the 
guy? He’d been thrown into the spotlight at a young 
age and if you’ve ever seen his father’s Twitter, 
you know he doesn’t have the best role models 
around. However what’s even more exciting than his 
becoming less of a jerk is his change in musical style.
Since singing Chris Brown songs on YouTube, Justin 
Bieber has always been influenced by hip hop and 
R&B. However he was instantly launched into the 
spotlight as a young pop star that young girls were 
literally selling their virginities to meet. Anyone 
over the age of sixteen didn’t even bother giving 
him the time of day, aside from maybe humming his 
mainstream songs because they were always on. 
I personally was an ardent Jonas Brothers fan and 
because I only had room in my heart for one J.B., I 
never really could get into his music. However, 
when he came out with his song “Boyfriend,” I saw a 
glimpse of something unexpected from him. I saw a 
glimpse of the Justin Bieber of today.
I was still in denial and naively waiting for the day 
that the Jonas Brothers would get back together that 
fateful day in 2012 when I first heard “Boyfriend” and 
thus I paid it and the rest of the Believe album no 
mind. When I heard “Where Are Ü Now” I knew that I 
could no longer ignore this new sound Justin Bieber 
had. I found myself actively listening to this song all 
the time. I actually felt bad for Justin Bieber that this 
person was not there when he needed them! Dare I 
say I was becoming a fan? As a hardcore fan girl in 
my youth, I knew that these were early onset signs 
for becoming a Belieber. I continued to push these 
thoughts out of my mind and told myself that I liked 
“Where Are Ü Now” because of Skrillex, but when I 
heard “What Do You Mean?” I could no longer blame 
anyone else for my love of this song. I had to come to 
terms with the fact that while Justin was making this 
effort to include more R&B stylings and synthesized 
music, I was turning into a Belieber.
Following the release of this song, I was wowed 
once again with “Sorry,” an anthem about how your 
ex actually misses you for your personality and not 
just for the sex. As much as I believe that every 
line of that song is entirely full of crap, the music 
is great and his vocals are even better. His song 
“Love Yourself” is a brutally honest jam about his 
dating someone who’s so vain, but only realizing it 
in hindsight even though he should have known the 
moment his mom said she didn’t like her. This song 
leaves me dying to know if it’s actually about Selena 
Gomez, and if so, why he dated her for so long. As 
if those songs weren’t enough, his latest single “I’ll 
Show You” has put my socks back on and blown 
them off again. Bieber sings about how it’s not easy 
being in the spotlight and even though the pressure 
makes it hard for him to always do the right thing, he 
plans on showing us the real Justin Bieber. If the real 
Justin Bieber keeps making this kind of music, I’ll be 
entering 2016 as a Belieber.
Justin Bieber has been on a steady incline following 
a very sharp decline. While he’s still not perfect as a 
person, his music has shown a whole new side of him 
that has never before been seen. His current music is 
so honest as opposed to all of the cookie-cutter pop 
songs he previously released. His music reflects real 
relationships and feelings as opposed to just being 
about nothing. I never thought that “Bieber Fever” 
could happen to me. I thought I followed all the 
precautions to make sure that I never 
caught it, but it came out of nowhere. Justin Bieber, 
after all these years, you may have finally made me 
one less lonely girl.

Even the journey to Studio 201 seemed perfectly suited 
to the experience that was Milk Like Sugar, a play about 
an underprivileged 16-year-old girl who must decide 
whether to follow through on her friends’ pregnancy pact. 
When our Lyft dropped us off at a seemingly deserted 
warehouse, we were near positive the location was 
wrong and we’d been stranded God knows where. But 
thankfully, Carnegie Mellon is a master of signs. We 
followed a trail of logoed arrows, which circled almost 
360 degrees around the building and ?nally arrived at 
an unassuming door marked “ENTER” in spray-painted 
letters. This one actually opened, and once inside, we 
were given our tickets and ushered into the largest, 
coolest freight elevator I’ve ever seen.
When we joined the half full audience, I felt that we’d 
stumbled upon a niche experimental theater piece. 
The set itself was immediately eye-catching. A wall 
of cardboard Pepsi boxes surrounded several monitors 
which blasted Nicki Minaj music videos, a sugary yet 
tooth-rotting pop culture reference that foreshadowed the 
central metaphor of Milk Like Sugar.
The play, written by Kirsten Greenidge in 2011, is 
clearly contemporary, riddled with slang-heavy dialogue 
and perhaps already outdated references to the un-
coolness of ?ip-phones. The plot hearkens back to 
after-school specials and ABC teen dramas, where the 
protagonist must rise above her situation and break the 
cycle of teen motherhood, abusive relationships, and 
underemployment. I was relieved that  Milk Like Sugar 
managed to avoid the worst cliches, including — worst of 
all — an improbably happy ending.
The play could’ve easily fallen ?at without junior acting 
major Daryl Paris Bright’s portrayal of earnest but never 
pitiful Annie. Junior musical theatre major Lea DiMarchi 
also shined as Annie’s best friend Talisha, a self-righteous 
bully in a snapback who turns to well-off older men to 
distract her from her poor life prospects. Senior acting 
major Alexandra Miyashiro’s Margie was perhaps the 
least compelling character, a shallow and clueless 
lollipop-licking girl who inspires the trio’s pact with her 
accidental pregnancy.
Annie is at the crossroads of an identity crisis. Talisha 
and Margie pressure her to go splitsies on a kickass 
baby shower. Her would-be “baby daddy” Malik, an 
amateur astronomer endearingly played by junior acting 
major Siddiq Saunderson, encourages her to follow him 
to college. Junior musical theatre major Iris Beaumier’s 
Keera, a wholesome poindexter-type who somehow 
becomes one of the play’s most interesting characters, 
preaches about the power of prayer and family game 
night.
Senior musical theatre major Rayquila Durham also gave 
a standout performance as Annie’s mother Myrna, a 
janitor who can barely read but dreams of becoming a 
writer. Having been a teen mom herself, Myrna works 
hard to provide for Annie, yet cannot bear the thought 
of her daughter proving herself to be “better.” Durham 
makes palpable Myrna’s battle between supporting 
Annie’s aspirations and shielding herself from the 
knowledge that a better life is beyond her reach. In 
one of the show’s most powerful scenes, Myrna rebels 
against Keera’s religious idealism, demanding to see “the 
Holy Ghost fry up some chicken” if he wants a prayer of 
gratitude so badly.
Predictably, Annie’s potential paths for a “better” life go 
sour. Like clockwork, Annie falls out with every important 
?gure in her life. Instead of adding much depth to the 
characters, these annoyingly equidistant scenes veered 
toward melodrama and the “tragic backstory” trope, 
reiterating the same PSA points until they grew tiresome.
Junior musical theatre major John Clay III played Love 
Interest #2 Antwoine, a tattoo artist who provides 
Annie with yet another hard dose of reality along with 
an unexpected shot of self-worth. Unlike Malik and 
Keera, Antwoine values Annie for the person she is, not 
for who he could shape her to be. When he and Annie 
make love, the distorted videos in the background grow 
clearer, actually focusing in on our protagonist’s face, 
and the “Great Wall” of Pepsi crashes down. Annie ?nds 
a moment of genuine connection and transcendence 
above the sugary fakeness that permeates her life. Even 
though she has fallen down the path society prescribes 
to girls like her, she actively makes that choice. Her lack 
of opportunity is tragic, as is the pervasiveness of such 
cycles of deprivation in low-income communities. It’s 
tragic that Annie has few better options than to tumble 
into Antwoine’s arms. But Milk Like Sugar is saved from 
being trite or overbearing by the fact that Annie is not a 
tragic character.
Milk Like Sugar has a number of points it’d like to 
shove down your throat, but with its intriguing use of 
multimedia and a few electric performances, its often 
bitter message goes down sweet.

Universal Studios in talks with Tom Cruise for 
The Mummy reboot
On Nov. 23, it was reported that Universal Studios’ 
upcoming “Monsters Universe” was putting its pieces 
on the board with a selection of writers developing 
production strategy for reboots of the studio’s classic 
?lms. A reboot of The Mummy will be the ?rst to emerge 
from the pack, and the studio is eyeing A-list action 
star Tom Cruise to play a leading role. Though this does 
not come as a shock, casting Cruise would be a home 
run choice for Universal. Cruise is one of the few true 
“action stars” remaining (along with Dwayne “The Rock” 
Johnson, Vin Diesel, and Jason Statham) but he brings 
an additional level of acting talent that most others 
attempt to imitate. Cruise has been nominated for three 
Academy Awards and has been cranking out action 
hit after action hit in the past few years. The Mission: 
Impossible series just saw another success with Mission: 
Impossible – Rogue Nation, Edge Of Tomorrow was one 
of 2014’s most pleasant surprises, and Cruise is currently 
?lming the sequel to Jack Reacher, Jack Reacher: Never 
Go Back. The deal between Cruise and Universal is not 
?nalized yet (at least, not publicly) but adding his caliber 
of talent would only increase the value of the new shared 
“Monsters Universe.” The Mummy is set for release in 
March 2017.
Steven Spielberg comments on recasting Indiana 
Jones
Recasting roles is not a new phenomenon in Hollywood, 
especially iconic roles. Seven different actors have 
played James Bond since the early 1960s. We are about 
to meet our third Spider-Man since 2002 with Tom 
Holland. The ?rst Indiana Jones ?lm, Raiders of the Lost 
Ark, was released in 1982 and was quickly followed by 
two more ?lms and a third in 2008. Steven Spielberg, 
director of all four Indiana Jones ?lms, has been hearing 
all the chatter about recasting the role with the likes 
of Chris Pratt or Bradley Cooper. As far as Spielberg is 
concerned, Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford and Harrison 
Ford is Indiana Jones.
“I don’t think anyone could replace Harrison as Jones, I 
don’t think that’s ever going to happen,” Spielberg said 
in an interview with Screen International. “It’s certainly 
not my intention to ever have another actor step into his 
shoes in the way there have been many actors that have 
played Spider-Man or Batman. There is only going to 
be one actor playing Indiana Jones and that’s Harrison 
Ford.”
Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucas?lm and producing 
partner with Spielberg, has con?rmed a ?fth ?lm is 
on their radar, but has no timetable for production 
or release. There is no denying Spielberg’s power in 
Hollywood, and the exponential growth of that power 
when discussing a ?lm series he is synonymous with 
building into the cinematic juggernaut it became. 
Personally, I think recasting the character would offer 
more opportunities for the survival of Indy. Obviously, 
should Harrison Ford return to the character, I would 
be ?rst in line at the theater, but considering Ford is 
entering his mid-70s, I am willing to put the character 
and the story in front of the man. Harrison Ford brought 
Indy to life and I’ll always be able to go back and watch 
The Temple of Doom whenever I need a dose of Harrison 
charm, but recasting the character would give Lucas?lm 
the freedom to think long-term about the franchise 
and develop any of the numerous stories that have 
been formed around the character. The creative team 
behind Indy is the same team behind Star Wars, but 
the franchises are very different. Indiana Jones needs a 
refreshing start to attract new audiences, especially in 
international markets, and attaching a new face may be 
just what the doctor ordered.
Universal Studios eyeing Ryan Gosling for Neil 
Armstrong biopic
Based on the James Hansen novel “First Man: A Life of 
Neil A. Armstrong” Universal Studios is looking to secure 
The Notebook star Ryan Gosling to star as the famous 
astronaut in the upcoming biopic aptly titled First Man. 
Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) is attached to direct, and 
this would not be the ?rst time Gosling and Chazelle 
would work together. The two are currently ?lming La 
La Land, a musical starring Gosling as a jazz pianist 
who falls in love with an aspiring actress played by 
Emma Stone. Chazelle made his directorial feature ?lm 
debut with Whiplash and directed J.K. Simmons to an 
Academy Award win, so his ability to draw out amazing 
performances is tested and proven.
The “Space Race,” as it was called, is an extraordinary 
time in American history and Armstrong made world 
history in 1969. Nearing the 50th anniversary would 
be a real treat to learn about the man’s story and re-
experience the magic that space travel offers. As far as 
Gosling is concerned, La La Land is still shooting, and 
he is slated to star in the sequel to Blade Runner. That 
?lm begins production next summer, and First Man 
would likely follow. Gosling can be seen in The Big Short, 
hitting theaters December 11, 2015, and in La La Land, 
which is set for release on July 16, 2016.

I walked through the door to Wigle Whiskey for their holiday 
bitters demo with a couple misconceptions. First, I thought 
I was about to get free drinks, yet I had to pay a reasonable 
six dollars for the most delicious whiskey cocktail I’ve ever 
imagined (The Burgundy: white wheat whiskey, apple 
cider, cranberry tea, and mulberry spice syrup, with a 
dusting of cinnamon on the surface). And second, I thought 
bitters were only for drinks. Demo leader and head of bitters 
distribution for Wigle Allison Burns proved me oh so wrong.
Allison stood behind her table, full of crackers, cheese, 
yogurt, soup, and bitters. She shouted “Remove bitters 
from your bar cart!” to anyone that asked. “It’s an extension 
of your spice rack!” My small mind couldn’t handle this 
rupture in reality. Prior to this life-changing experience, 
the only ideas I had about bitters were of that Angostura 
bottle with the confusing paper that doesn’t actually ?t, and 
classic cocktails like an Old Fashioned or a Manhattan. But 
then I realized what a bitters is, and it’s really nothing more 
than an extract: botanicals soaked in alcohol for a long time 
that becomes a super concentrated ?avor bomb. You just 
have to know how to use it.
The recommendations that Allison had laid out for us 
on the table were a really exciting sneak peek into the 
potential of bitters as an ingredient. The ?rst taste I got of 
it all was just an amped up cheese and crackers, which she 
recommended as a snack to leave out for guests at a party. 
It was simply crackers and slices of brie, but then she had 
mixed up honey with bitters to drizzle on top. Even better, 
there were two options: honey with pomander orange 
bitters, and honey with rosemary lavender bitters. Both 
were great, but I personally loved the pomander orange. 
Brie and fruit are just so perfect together.
Next to that was maple-?avored Greek yogurt with mole 
bitters, which is inspired by a Mexican sauce which 
is both spicy and chocolaty — the stuff of dreams. The 
?avor combination was intensely good. The smoky sweet 
maple ?avor really hits it off with the spicy dark bitter 
?avor. I could imagine this as just breakfast, or even a dip 
for some crunchy gingersnaps. Allison also shared that 
for Thanksgiving she used the mole bitters on top of her 
pumpkin pie, and every morning she throws a little splash 
in her coffee. Both had me very tempted to buy a bottle.
But the true treasure of the evening was the squash soup 
featuring the classic aromatic bitters. For the penny-
pinchers, unmotivated folks, or unskilled chefs, you can 
do this with any store-bought boxed soup and a couple 
tablespoons of bitters. But if you’re the from-scratch type, 
here’s some good news. Allison was giving out recipes.
Squash and Bitters Soup
1 3-pound squash, kabocha, butternut, or pumpkin
2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
2 large leeks, while and pale green parts only, ?nely 
chopped
1 clove of garlic, minced
1 quart of chicken stock
2 cups of water
2 tablespoons of aromatic bitters, Wigle variety 
recommended
2 tablespoons of light brown sugar
1 teaspoons of sea salt
3/4 teaspoon of black pepper
1/3 cup of heavy cream
Start out by peeling the squash, removing all the seeds, and 
chopping it into 2-inch cubes.
Then in a big heavy pot, melt the butter over medium heat. 
This will become the tasty bubble bath for the leeks and 
garlic. Let them simmer and stir occasionally until the leeks 
are translucent, which should take about six minutes. Next 
up is everything but the cream. Cook it all uncovered until 
the squash is tender. Somewhere around 25 minutes later, 
pour the pre-soup chunky medley into a blender in batches.
This serves eight, so when you make this for your next 
fancy friend dinner party or to impress your family over 
break, give your guests options. I recommend putting 
the heavy cream in a gravy-boat-type pouring container, 
alongside some extra salt, pepper, and bitters. Let everyone 
have their soup perfectly to their taste. I would also add 
some spice to the soup, like nutmeg or cinnamon, but 
sparingly of course so you don’t overwhelm the squash.
Allison said that the beauty of bitters is that it brings out 
the sweetness around it, and this rang the truest to me in 
this soup. It’s so creamy, sweet, and seasonal. Then that 
little hit of bitter on the back of your tongue reminds to 
appreciate the slight sweetness.
But since I would also like to throw in a nod to tradition, 
and no meal is complete without a cocktail, I must include 
Wigle’s recipe for an Old Fashioned.
Old Fashioned
2 ounces of wheat whiskey
1 sugar cube
2 dashes of pomander orange bitter (which was my hands-
down favorite)
1 piece of orange peel
Muddle the sugar cube with the bitters to dissolve it. Then 
add the whiskey and stir it up. Because you’re fancy, ?nish 
it off with a little twist of orange peel. Bottoms up, friends.

Row House makes a boring movie bearable 
The fun cinema environment makes sitting through a slow, older film more exciting 
If you think that “French v. Hong Kong New Wave” sounds 
inaccessible and pretentious, you’re right. Even so, I was 
compelled by my love of ?lm and French to leave my warm 
dorm room for the chilly streets of Lawrenceville Friday 
night. Full disclosure, I could only sit through one of Row 
House cinema’s four screenings of both French and Hong 
Kong new wave ?lms. Don’t get me wrong; the theater was 
lovely, clean, and entirely functional. The ?lm, however, was 
hard to get through (potentially due to my underdeveloped 
?lm knowledge — pun intended).
I’m pretty clueless when it comes to ?lm-making and ?lm 
history, so here’s the relatively minimal context I learned for 
this ?lm screening: New Wave is a ?lm movement that is 
characterized by signi?cant innovations to the medium (like 
location shooting) as well as a uniquely socially conscious 
voice centered around cultural and political issues of 
the time. French New Wave is attributed to ?lmmakers 
of the 1950s and ‘60s who were moving away from the 
mainstream period pieces largely written by French 
novelists. Row House showed Made in the U.S.A. and 
Le Cercle Rouge to illustrate the work of this movement. 
Similarly, Hong Kong New Wave sought to upend the 
status quo by creating grittier, rougher ?lms that were also 
distinctly Hong Kong. Their ?lms were made in Cantonese, 
the dialect of most residents, rather than the industry-
dominated Mandarin ?lms that were shot by transplanted 
mainland ?lmmakers. The spirit of this movement was 
shown with the screenings of Fallen Angels and The Killer 
at Row House. I’m fairly certain that the parallels between 
the New Wave movement in different countries are vast, 
complicated, interesting, etc. Unfortunately, I know nothing 
about them and was drawn to Le Cercle Rouge mainly 
because of my conversational knowledge of French.
Le Cercle Rouge is about two men and their male friends 
as they plan and execute an “elaborate” heist. Main 
characters Corey and Vogel are attractive criminals who 
are mustachioed and clean-shaven, respectively. Corey 
is sprung from prison after making a seedy deal with a 
corrupt prison guard in which he agrees to do one last 
job. Meanwhile, Vogel escapes from a train bound for an 
especially secure prison and is now on the run from the 
French police. From the moment that Vogel dives into 
Corey’s trunk, the two are fast friends, and begin plotting 
a good old-fashioned jewelry heist once they get back 
to Paris. I won’t spoil the ending, because it was pretty 
unexpected. However, like most of the movie, it was also 
anti-climactic.
Overall, I had the same general thought as I always do 
when watching old movies, which is “aww.” It’s usually an, 
“aww, that’s cute” with mild condescension and apology 
at the parts that feel obsolete. Still, there are valuable 
moments of perspective that can be gained from old ?lms. 
For example, scenes from Vogel’s train escape yield some 
remarkably beautiful and enlightening images. First, we are 
shown the open and solitary countryside and forested areas 
where Vogel has taken shelter, and soon after, this visceral 
landscape is quickly transformed by the occupation of 
myriad police of?cers as they form lines and begin to comb 
for the fugitive. The once peaceful and isolated hillsides 
are now swarming with beings, creating an intense 
atmosphere for the chase. This type of imagery is timeless.
Additionally, although the ?lm takes a general crime drama 
format, there are many unexpected moments scattered 
throughout that take a strangely light-hearted tone. For 
instance, there are two different scenes that depict the 
uncompromising detective, Mattei, at home, feeding his 
three cats. The cats are not integral to the plot in any 
way, so I’m led to believe they are there for comic relief 
and character development. It’s scenes like this that feel 
quintessentially “old-fashioned” because they are stripped 
of every gimmick, reliant on their premise in order to be 
funny. I appreciate it because it makes me wonder about 
what was considered funny back in the day and how things 
have changed. Maybe 45 years ago it was crazily absurd for 
a full-grown man to go home to an apartment of cats and 
be so loving towards them. Maybe, it got some belly laughs 
back then, but this is usually one of the points where I 
think, “Aww, how cute,” and move on.
Overall, the ?lm was a drag, but the beer selection was 
great and the seats were decently clean and comfortable. 
Row House likes to have fun with its audience by 
discounting ticket prices to patrons that are in costume, 
and offering a Twilight Zone pinball machine in the lobby. 
Needless to say I’m excited to go back next week for a 
series of Miyazaki screenings in full costume. In general, I 
recommend visiting Row House Cinema on Butler St; just 
don’t go to see a ?lm that you know nothing about because 
you’re told that it’s old and important.

I chose to study abroad at the Carnegie Mellon 
equivalent school in London: an all science, technical 
university called Imperial College London, where at 
a 70:30 male to female gender ratio, the odds are still 
good and the goods are still odd. Unlike most study 
abroad programs, I will be in London for the entire 
school year and taking classes for my primary major for 
the duration of my stay.
Upon ?rst arriving in London, I quickly became aware 
of the “vacation changes.” These are what I like to 
consider to be the differences between the UK and US 
that anybody going to London on vacation will notice. 
For example, almost getting hit by a black cab because 
you looked the wrong way before crossing the street or 
the fact that British people don’t say vacation, they say 
“holiday.” At ?rst, these differences really stressed me 
out (I have an irrational fear of being hit by a car), but 
now, three months later, all of this has become a part of 
my daily life. People no longer need to translate for me 
when there’s a British word I don’t understand. In fact, 
I now use some of these foreign sayings myself.
At Carnegie Mellon, I was in a sorority and Mock Trial, 
was working a part time job, and had to keep up with 
classes for a double major in chemical engineering and 
engineering & public policy. Here in London, I only 
have chemical engineering courses. I have an average 
of three hours of class per weekday. We do not have 
any graded problem sets or midterms. There is only 
one ?nal exam for each of our courses in June. I cannot 
remember the last time in my life that I have been so 
stress-free.
I spend my time doing the things I wish I could have 
done last year, but never had time for. I walk down to 
Pret-A-Manger, London’s Starbucks equivalent, for a 
coffee. I run through Hyde Park on the daily, which 
actually is an incredible experience in itself. My usual 
route takes me around the famous Serpentine River 
and then past Kensington Palace, where the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge reside. I am lucky, because I am 
located just south of Hyde Park, and right next door to 
the Royal Albert Hall, where events such as the world 
premiere of the new James Bond movie occur. All I 
have to do is peek out my window and watch the movie 
stars walk down the red carpet right below me.
London is probably the most expensive place I have 
ever been. One pound is equivalent to approximately 
one-and-a-half dollars and I spend about three times 
more per week than I did in Pittsburgh (to be fair, I am 
overspending). I’m constantly tempted by the styles 
and clothes that people wear here and have Harrod’s 
and great shopping right down the road from me. I 
have to cook for myself here (after being on Red-9 for 
two years) and have found myself copying the ?rst-
year students on my ?oor for dinner ideas. I am the 
only third year on my ?oor, but it seems as though the 
?rst years that I live with are just as mature as I am. I 
believe that it partially has something to do with the 
drinking age being 18 in this country. Drinking is much 
more casual and accepted here. The dorm I live in has 
its own bar downstairs that our university sponsors. 
Our hall sponsored events typically involve drinking. 
It’s very strange for me that we are encouraged to be 
drinking in our ?rst-year dorms together.
Something I will always be grateful to Carnegie Mellon 
for is its diversity. Last year, I made friends with a study 
abroad student at Carnegie Mellon from Switzerland. 
This semester, during a long weekend, I was able to 
visit him and get to explore the Swiss Alps and eat 
endless Swiss cheese and chocolate. Traveling is 
one of the best parts of getting to study abroad, and 
knowing someone from the place you are going makes 
the experience so much better. So far, I have visited 
Geneva and Edinburgh and will be going to Berlin soon. 
Traveling around Europe, even by plane, is extremely 
cheap, and has made this experience so memorable.
It’s now the end of the ?rst semester, and I am so glad 
that I will be here until the end of June. I have been 
here for three months already   — the time has ?own by. 
I have grown to love this city and all it has to offer. The 
crowded tube stations during rush hour, the women 
dressed in Topshop from head to toe, and for now, the 
Christmas lights on every street market across the city. 
This school year, so far, has been so different on so 
many levels and I can’t wait to see what next semester 
has in store for me.
