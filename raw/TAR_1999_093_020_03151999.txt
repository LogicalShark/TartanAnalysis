The Baker Hall extension project has 
reached the final stages of the design 
phase, and the Board of Trustees is set to 
vote on, the project 
earlynextmonth. The 
building, to be con­
structed in the classic 
Hornbostel/Beaux 
Arts style prevalent 
around campus, will 
cost $7.5 million and 
will provide approxi­
mately 20,000 square 
feet of new space.
“We’re pretty much 
done with the basic 
planning and are 
moving into the de­
sign specifications, 
where the smaller 
details are finalized,” 
said Peter Steams, 
dean of H&SS.
The extension will 
be built where the 
current Baker Hall 
parking lot is located 
adjacent to Frew 
Street. Physically, 
the building will 
closely resemble Baker Hall, but accord­
ing to Steams, it will depend heavily on 
windows to provide light throughout the 
wing, especially in. the basement.
The top two floors of the extension 
will house the Psychology Department, 
which is currently experiencing a space 
shortage. “We’re absolutely cramped
for space,” said Roberta L. Klatzky, 
professor and head of the department. 
“There are far too many people packed 
into the offices, and this has hindered 
any attempt to expand the department.” 
The new space will provide the
[against other universities] we found 
that we scored very low in faculty 
lab areas.”
Both Stearns and Klatzky noted the 
technological capabilities of the new 
wing. “The building will be fully wired

President Jared Cohon and one gradu­
ating senior will be speaking at this 
year’s commencement ceremony, con­
tinuing a trend started last year of 
eliminating a keynote speaker from the 
proceedings. This decision, made by a 
graduation committee including Direc­
tor of Special Events Maryanne Moore, 
is the result of careful revisions 
aimed at tightening up the event and 
making it ran more smoothly than in 
previous years.
“The current plan is to follow last 
year’s model and have only the Presi­
dent and the graduating student 
speaker be speakers for the event,” said 
Michael Murphy, dean of student af­
fairs. “In addition, we are returning to 
our historic model of giving honorary 
degrees, but these individuals will not 
be asked to speak. In recent years, we 
had moved away from honorary de­
grees and did have a distinguished 
alumnus as a keynote, in addition to 
the President and the student speaker,” 
said Murphy. Although no one agreed 
unanimously on the topic, many felt 
that having three speakers and honor-

Scotland Yard was formerly located 
on the first floor of Morewood Gardens. 
People knew and loved it during it’s 
existence. This student hangout was 
later replaced by the Children’s Day 
Care Center, which moved up from the 
basement. Now, the basement space has 
been allocated for student use, and will 
house a new center for students.
Renovations are almost complete on 
Morewood Basement, and the grand 
opening is scheduled for sometime 
around the end of the semester.
Student Senate has announced that 
Gullifty’s will serve as the vendor, and 
will be having selected menu items such 
as sandwiches, hot foods, lunch specials, 
and desserts. Gullifty’s will be accepting

is also the possibility of Sunday night 
dinners resembling home-cooked meals 
and of a delivery service to students on 
campus.
Though still needing a lot of work, 
the space has an occupational capacity 
of 200 people. There are multi-level

Senate expands online information
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
Since the advent of online 
registration (OLR) at CMU,.the 
process has undergone a series 
of corrections and revisions. The 
current project, headed by the 
Academic Affairs committee 
(AA) of Student Senate, is to 
provide a larger range of course 
information for students to use 
as reference material when reg­
istering for classes.
Currently, a large portion of 
the course information collected 
by the University is either un­
available to students or, in the 
case of Faculty Course Evalua­
tions (FCEs) and information 
provided by the professors 
themselves, difficult to get at, 
according to the AA report to 
Student Senate. The initial re­
port, presented in the spring of
1998, outlined a two-phase pro­
cess for allowing students more 
access to this information before 
they register for classes.
The project developed after 
comparing the registration pro­
cess at CMU to those at other 
universities. “Princeton, for ex­
ample, hires students to review 
all classes and make comments,” 
said senior mechanical engi­
neering major Amy Ng, chair of 
the AA committee. “They’re a 
much larger school [than CMU], 
and they have a much larger 
amount ofinformation available 
to students.”
Phase one. of the project focuses 
primarily on printing FCEs on­
line in an easily accessible for­
mat. “In the past, the compila­
tion of FCEs was just a book that 
you could only get if you hap­
pened to walk by a distribution 
point,” Ng said. “They were also
on Andrew, but it was hard to 
navigate through the text- 
based environment to find 
them.” The report pointed out 
that since all FCEs are already 
typed up for the books currently 
distributed each semester, it 
would be a simple process to 
make them available online 
with links from the current 
course information pages.
Another aspect of the FCEs 
currently overlooked are the stu­
dent comments regarding the 
classes. “The comments stu­
dents make can be very valu­
able to other students, so we 
wanted to make them available,” 
Ng said. The proposed process 
would be to sort through the 
comments looking for the topics 
most frequently mentioned for 
each class — for example, any 
comments regarding the

Last Wednesday, Earl Crane, a 
junior in mechanical engineering, 
accepted the gavel that 
was handed to him by Rob 
Migliore, senior in electrical and 
computer engineering and eco­
nomics, marking his acceptance 
of the presidency of the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC).
The inaugura­
tion ceremony 
served as an 
official conclu­
sion to the elec­
tions held a 
week earlier 
when SDC rep­
resentatives 
voted in Crane 
as president, 
and Justin 
Elker, sopho­
more in public 
policy manage­
ment, as vice, 
president.
“I am hon­
ored that gen­
eral body de­
cided to elect 
me,” said 
Crane. “I am 
thrilled with

mendous amount of ideas, en­
thusiasm, motivation, and he in­
teracts with people well, which is 
pretty crucial for the role,” said 
Migliore. “I think Earl is looking 
to beef up everything we do now. 
Success will be measured on how 
he exceeds people’s expectations.” 
“One of the biggest challenges 
is that this organization is so 
big and does so many things 
that it takes the new president
position.”
Crane first became involved 
with SDC his freshman year, 
when he joined the Properties 
Committee, which oversees all 
the recreation equipment in the 
dorms. He became chairperson 
of that committee that year, and 
then was elected vice president 
during his sophomore year.
Some of Crane’s plans for the 
future of SDC include address­
ing concerns in areas of food and 
dining services and providing as­
sistance to RAs. Also, he will 
continue to look into SDC’s booth 
program, which is currently un­
der scrutiny.

Crane finds his new position 
to be a huge responsibility that 
seems much greater now that he 
is actually in it. He said, “The 
responsibility on the details that 
are required when in the posi­
tion of president is a lot bigger 
and a lot more difficult than what 
you’d expect on the outside. 
When you move from number 
two to number one, it’s a dou­
bling of responsibility. The 
amount of time you spend think­
ing or planning or preparing just 
makes the experience more fun 
and exciting.”
“Earl is someone with a tre-
a while to get a grasp on doing 
everything at once,” said Brian 
Bluth, a graduate student in 
biological sciences and the 
1997-1998 SDC president. “My 
advice to all presidents have 
been to create some kind of stra­
tegic plan for the upcoming year 
that he can refer to to prioritize 
what needs to get done and what 
he wants to get done.”
“One of the biggest challenges

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Ex­
pressing concern that recent charges 
of police misconduct could undermine 
the fight against crime, President 
Clinton on Saturday proposed im­
proved training and other steps to 
restore “the bonds of trust” between 
the public and law enforcement.
“I have been deeply disturbed by 
recent allegations of serious police 
misconduct and continued reports of 
racial profiling that have shaken 
some communities’ faith in the po­
lice who are there to protect them,” 
Clinton said.
Recent questionable shootings by 
police that took the lives of young 
blacks in New York, Pittsburgh, and 
Riverside, Calif., have revived de­
bate about how officers handle con­
frontations with minorities. In New 
Jersey, state troopers have come 
under fire for conducting traffic stops 
based on'a driver’s race — so-called 
racial profiling.
Leaders of the National Associa­
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People, the National Council of La 
Raza, the National Asian Pacific 
American Legal Consortium, and 
other groups have called on Clinton 
to speak out against police brutality 
and withhold federal funds from de­
partments with poor records.
The president used his weekly ra­
dio address to speak to those con­
cerns. He also offered a series of fed­
eral initiatives and policy suggestions 
designed to bolster public confidence 
in law enforcement.
Clinton touted the steady drop in 
crime nationwide since his adminis­
tration began promoting community 
policing. But he cautioned that those 
advances could be undermined if pub­
lic trust in the police waned.
“While each specific allegation will 
have to be dealt with on its own 
merits, it is clear that we need a
renewed determination as a nation 
to restore those bonds of trust that 
have been absolutely critical to our 
success at lowering the crime rate,” 
he said.
The president taped his address at 
the White House oh Friday before fly­
ing to Hope, Ark., to dedicate his birth­
place as a historical site and raise 
money for Democrats.
Clinton was attending two events in 
Little Rock Saturday, and expected to 
raise $200,000 at each of them for the 
Democratic National Committee and 
the state party.
To enhance relations between the 
police and citizens, the president said 
he would instruct the Justice De­
partment to expand police ethics 
training at 30 regional community 
policing centers. He proposed a $40 
million funding increase to improve 
police training nationwide.
He also called for a nationwide pro­
gram to help more communities estab­
lish “Citizen Police Academies” to ac­
quaint citizens with the work of law 
enforcement, and $2 million to help 
police departments recruit more mi­
nority officers.
“Police departments ought to reflect 
the diversity of the communities they 
serve,” Clinton said.
Also, he noted that the current 
Justice Department budget includes 
new funds to enforce civil rights laws 
“so that a few bad police officers do 
not undermine the progress, and the 
support, that hundreds of thousands 
of police officers have worked so hard 
to earn.”
The National Association of Police 
Organizations, an umbrella group of 
law enforcement unions and other in­
terests, has called on the administra­
tion to produce programs to inform 
police cadets and current officers that 
official misconduct carries federal 
prison terms.
Candy bar maker 
faces sour times
PITTSBURGH (AP) — The maker of 
the Clark Bar, which found success with 
a 5-cent-sized candy bar sent to Ameri­
can troops during World War I, has filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
after years of financial turmoil.
“Clark has had many problems in the 
past several years,” Clark Bar America 
Inc. spokeswoman Diana Scally said 
Monday. “Unfortunately, it’s just gotten 
to the point where we need protection 
from creditors.”
Company officials have worked for 
the past 18 months on a restructuring 
plan but ran out of time and had no 
option but to seek bankruptcy protec­
tion in federal court, Scally said. The 
candy bar ran into trouble once before 
when its previous maker also filed for 
bankruptcy protection.
The filing will enable Clark to keep 
operating under a court’s supervision 
while it develops a plan for returning to 
solvency.
It was the best option to keep some 100 
employees working to produce the sig­
nature Clark Bar, a chocolate-coated 
peanut butter crunch bar, and other 
variations, Scally said.
Officials are discussing bringing in 
new investors or selling the company, 
but no immediate layoffs are expected, 
Scally said.
Clark has been making candy bars in 
Pittsburgh for more than a century. Irish 
immigrant D.L. Clark founded the com­
pany in 1886 in two back rooms of a 
small house on the city’s north side.
Computer serves 
as gang recruiter
FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) — Law 
officers have accused a group of teen­
agers of recruiting gang members based 
on a Web site created by the group.
Fayette County sheriffs deputies ob­
tained warrants to arrest five teenagers 
on charges of violating the Georgia Street 
Gang and Terrorism Act.
A 17-year-old, who was not identi­
fied, was arrested Thursday, and his 
father said he found the whole ordeal 
hard to comprehend.
“One of their buddies last year jok­
ingly created a Web page and put five 
people’s names on it,” he said. “It’s just 
five kids who live in the neighborhood.”
If convicted of encouraging others to join 
the “Rollin 5 Crackaz,” the teen-agers 
could be sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Sheriffs Maj. Bruce Jordan said the 
Web site, which gives the boys’ full 
names along with “street” names such 
as Baby Z and Killa Turk, is a recruit­
ing tool — even though it does not 
solicit members for a gang in this south­
ern Atlanta suburb.
“An Internet site that says how great 
your group is is basically advertising 
your group,” Jordan said. “We’re trying 
to be proactive and keep from having a 
serious gang problem.”
Debbie Seagraves, director of the 
Georgia chapter of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, said the sheriffs office 
has violated the boys’ First Amend­
ment rights.
“If they break the law in the real world, 
not the virtual world, that’s a different 
matter,” Seagraves said. “If they are 
punished for telling other kids about 
their group, that’s a clear violation of 
their rights.”
Extreme weather 
stymies travelers
COLBY, Kan. (AP) — Hundreds of 
travelers spent the night jammed into 
motels and community shelters while a 
storm blew more than a foot of snow 
across the central Plains.
The 115-mile-long stretch of Interstate 
70 from Wakeeney west to the Colorado 
state line was reopened Saturday but 
remained snow-packed and dangerous, 
authorities said.
More than 500 travelers spent the night 
in Colby, filling shelters set up by the Red 
Cross and the National Guard Armory. 
Hundreds more spent the night in Limon, 
Colo., because of the Kansas road closure.
The storm caught Matt Brahana, a 
University of Missouri student, as he
headed back to Columbia, Mo., from, 
Denver, where the Tigers basketball, 
team lost in the NCAA tournament. 
Thursday night.
“It took me four and a half hours to get 
this far,” Brahana said in Colby.
“I didn’t feel safe on the roads any­
more,” Brahana said. “You couldn’t see 
at all.”
As the storm moved eastward Satur­
day, thunderstorms boiled up along its 
southern, warmer side, and the Na; 
tional Weather Service issued a tor­
nado watch for sections of Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Alabama, and extreme, 
northwestern Florida. Nine traffic 
deaths were blamed on the weather. 
Friday in Oklahoma.
Conditions were so bad in Colby that 
restaurants and stores closed early Fri­
day. Kayla Korte, manager of a Burger 
King, said she closed three hours early 
after everyone on the night shift called 
to say they couldn’t make it in.
Cheese garners 
national praises
GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP)—In the land 
where cheese is king, a new king of 
cheese reigns.
A sturdy brick cheese made by the 
Klondike Cheese Co. of Monroe won the 
top prize at the U.S. Championship 
Cheese Contest. Klondike also won an 
award for its feta cheese.
Milfred Severson, head cheesemaker 
at Klondike Cheese, has won four best=. 
of-class awards at the cheese champi­
onships, but it was his first national 
championship.
“I’ve been working on it for 30 years,” 
Severson said. “I can’t describe it. I’m 
excited and worked up. I can hardly 
sit still.”
Severson’s brick, bearing the Coun­
try Cheese brand, stood out for its 
flavor and appearance, said Bill 
Schinslog, chief judge of the contest 
where judges spent the week evaluat­
ing 577 cheeses, selecting best-of-class 
winners in 22 categories.
Entries from Wisconsin, a dairy state 
renowned for its devotion to cheese, took 
36 of 66 awards in this year’s contest.

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) — De­
parting for peace talks in France, ethnic 
Albanian delegates said today they were 
ready to sign a U.S.-backed Kosovo peace 
plan if the Serb-led government backs 
down on its opposition to allowing NATO 
troops to enforce it.
Meanwhile, there was no letup in the 
fighting between government forces and 
ethnic Albanian rebels in the province in 
southern Serbia.
Three bombs went off this afternoon 
in two government-controlled cities, kill­
ing at least six people and injuring more 
than 60. In one of the cities, Kosovska 
Mitrovica, the blast occurred next to a 
mosque in a fruit and vegetable market 
packed with weekend shoppers.
Hours later, the area was covered in 
blood, and witnesses spoke of seeing 
arms and legs hurled about the stalls.
“Everyone was looking around won­
dering what happened,” said an 18-year- 
old cigarette vendor, who gave his name
only as Agim. “Then all you could hear 
were screams.”
International monitors said govern­
ment forces had set fire to more than 
25 ethnic Albanian homes in villages 
near the northwestern town of Vucitrn 
on Saturday, apparently in retaliation 
for the killing of two Serb civilians in 
the area a week ago. Reporters saw 
plumes of smoke rising above hills in 
the area.
More than 2,000 people, mostly eth­
nic Albanians, have been killed and an 
estimated 300,000 displaced since 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
launched a crackdown a year ago 
against ethnic Albanians seeking inde­
pendence from Serbia, the main repub­
lic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of Kosovo’s 2 million 
people are ethnic Albanians, and senti­
ment for independence is strong.
Before leaving for Paris, Hashim 
Thaci, the delegation chief and a se­
nior official of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, told reporters the rebels had 
reached a decision on whether to sign 
the plan and would give a “definite 
answer” when the talks open Monday. 
The deal grants self-rule for Kosovo 
but not the independence the insur­
gents seek.
“We are going to Paris with the best 
intentions to make this work,” Thaci 
said. He and the rest of the delegation 
arrived in France later Saturday.
Thaci, flanked by KLA military chief 
Sulejman Selimi and other rebel com­
manders, stopped short of declaring that 
the rebels would sign. Other ethnic Al­
banian delegates said they would agree 
to the deal.
“Our intention is to go and sign the 
agreement and talk about the imple­
mentation,” said Veton Surroi, who has 
close ties to the rebels. Rexhep Qosja, 
another delegate, said there was a “con­
sensus” among all groups in the 15-
member delegation to accept the deal.
Another ethnic Albanian delegate, 
Hidajet Hyseni, said that without NATO 
troops, his delegation would not sign. 
“We are firm that the document is ac­
ceptable only as a whole,” Hyseni said.
Negotiations in France were sus­
pended February 23 without ethnic Al­
banian agreement to sign the peace plan. 
Since then, the rebels have repeatedly 
hinted their readiness to sign but have 
held back, either because of divisions in 
their ranks or to bargain for better terms.
Milosevic has firmly rejected foreign 
troops — the key element in the 
peace plan.
The Serb Media Center said the bomb 
in Kosovska Mitrovica, 45 miles north­
west of the provincial capital of Pristina, 
killed three people and injured nearly 
40. Two bombs exploded about an hour 
earlier in Podujevo, 20 miles north of 
Pristina, killing three and injuring about 
20 others, the center added. One of the
bombs exploded near the post office and 
the other at a market.
Serb sources, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said police suspected KLA 
hard-liners who opposed the peace plan! 
In Kosovska Mitrovica, however, eth­
nic Albanians claimed the blast had 
occurred after Serb police normally on 
duty there quietly withdrew from the 
market area.
International peace monitors iri 
Kosovo called the blasts “callous terror­
ist attacks.”
Fighting also , raged along the Alba­
nian border and in northwestern Kosovo; 
There was no report of casualties.
Neighboring Albania began military 
maneuvers in the north, and Prime Min­
ister Pandeli Majko said the maneuvers 
sent “a signal” that Albania was pre­
pared “to defend itself.”
Elsewhere, international monitors 
heard heavy weapons fire Saturday 
morning south of Kosovska Mitrovica.

1949 — Professor G. L. Bach, 
head of the economics depart­

In addition, the formation of a

would lead up to the formal es­

Shortly after the act, there was

one administration official.
10 YEARS AGO, March 14, 
1989 — Delta Upsilon’s (DU) ap­
peal of the Sweepstakes Advi­
sory Committee’s ban of two- 
wheel buggies failed. In January, 
Sweepstakes Chair Chris Hansen 
had prohibited buggies with fewer 
than three wheels.
This came a year after Delta 
Upsilon’s two-wheel buggy King 
Eider crashed into Beta Theta 
Pi’s Challenger in the sweep­
stakes finals. DU’s buggy had 
rolled a course record 2:08.5 in 
the prelimary heat, however, and 
the fraternity asked for a chance 
to prove themselves again in 
their appeal.
FIVE YEARS AGO, March 14, 
1994 — The loading dock at Cy- 
ert Hall was closed until further 
notice after the smell of carbon 
monoxide fumes was noticed in 
the building. There was a fear 
that carbon monoxide was leak­
ing into the building.
This incident followed a series 
of illness spells suffered by work­
ers in Cyert Hall. Technicians in 
room A70, located directly above 
the dock, had been complaining 
of occasional headaches and diz­
ziness for almost a year.
Monitors were bought in pellet 
form and placed in various areas 
several months earlier. The pel­
lets darken in the presence of 
this gas as well as many other 
hazardous gases. Even a slight 
taint indicated a harmful envi­
ronment. One of the monitors was 
permanently darkened, possibly
meaning that the gas had reached 
deadly levels.
ONE YEAR AGO, March 16, 
1998 — A drama major, who was 
displeased with an art project on 
display at the Wats:on? Festival^ 
expressed her dissent by tearing 
it down. Following the vandal­
ism, she announced her action to 
the Dean of the College of Fine 
Arts and accepted full responsi-; 
bility for it.
The project was eventually 
taken out of the garbage can^

amount of time spent on homework each 
week — and printing them with the ac- 
companyingFCEs. “Comments that come 
up frequently are probably important 
and should be put [online]. Unfortunately, 
We’re not sure of the best format for doing 
that yet,” Ng said.
11 The second phase of the project, a re­
port which will be presented to the Uni­
versity Education Council on March 16 
¿nd Student Senate on March 17, would 
make available a variety of different types 
of course information determined by stu­
dent surveys conducted in spring 1998. 
The surveys consisted of 10 proposed 
types of class information, on which the 
students were asked to reply whether 
they approved or disapproved of adding 
that information to the current OLR re­
sources. Each proposed addition received 
more than 50 percent approval, with the 
ihost popular options being an outline of 
the work distribution (92 percent), clearer 
course descriptions (90 percent),and an 
estimate of the actual hours per week 
spent on the class (90 percent).
Much of this information is available 
for certain classes, but can only be 
found through the course Web pages. 
Compiling this information into one cen­
tralized location is the focus of the project’s 
second phase. “The course. web[. cmu.edu]
to quickly put up relevant informa­
tion,” said Ng.
Another data set that AA hopes could 
be posted is the dates of exams and 
majorprojects for thecourse. “We want 
students to be able to go into course, web 
and see the important dates, then go 
over to calendar.webl.cmu.edu] and 
plan their schedules around potential 
crunch times,” Ng said.
“Of course, we wouldn’t expect pro­
fessors to set firm dates so early and 
then get stuck later, but we hope for 
general guidelines that students can 
judge their schedule by,” she said.
While the details of that process are 
worked out, a simple intermediate 
step is already under development. 
The details of this process deal with 
keeping the existing course informa­
tion up to date and letting students see 
which textbooks will be necessary for a 
course before they register. 
“A lot of times [students] go into a 
course site and find a description that 
was written three years ago, and that’s 
not helpful at all,” Ng said. “Hopefully, 
if professors have an easy way 
to update the information every 
semester, they’ll be more likely to keep 
it current.”
If all the proposed additions are imple­
mented, students can look forward to a

èerver is an existing resource that could 
provide this information, but itisn’tused,” 
Ng said. To convince professors to use the 
new resource, the report calls for a simple, 
fill-in-the-blank interface for placing 
course information online. “The setup 
would be a template for professors to use
much more comprehensive source of 
information for choosing their sched­
ules from a source they can easily ac­
cess. “Everyone is going to be using the 
Web more and more,” Ng said. “The 
structure is already in place — we just 
want to take advantage of it.”

located in the old 
Skibo which has been 
replaced by the Uni­
versity Center. This 
space will also have 
smoking and non­
smoking areas which 
have been designed 
to suit student needs.

Another thing is — a

AB are working on a

Gross, a junior his­
tory major and presi­
dent of the student 
body. “We are also 
looking into getting 
video arcades and 
jukeboxes and a TV, 
but we cannot move with any'of these 
purchases until we find out what the 
light and sound systems will cost.” The 
furniture would include chairs and 
tables for the main floor, and benches, 
couches, love seats, pillows, and lamps 
for the rest of the area, which includes 
the multi-level elevations, quiet niches, 
a very wide corridor, and one separate 
room which has possibilities. There is 
also a stage available for bands, poetry 
readings, one-act plays, and other ac­
tivities.
The basement is meant to have a very 
casual atmosphere where students will 
be allowed to do as they please. And the 
furniture will allow students to just put 
up their feet and relax. There is also talk 
of having groups of people to get to­

enjoy the atmosphere. The basement

When asked why there has been a 
delay in the opening of the basement, 
Gross pointed out the many events that 
hindered the progress of the basement 
project. The Child Care Center had pre­
viously been in there and it was using 
the space over the summer of 1998 — a 
time during which renovation was to 
occur. In the fall of 1998, some renova­
tions were made, but the progress was 
hampered by the unavailability of people 
during the holiday seasons. The ventila­
tion system was not adequate for the 
vendor to prepare his type of food and 
had to be redone.Clas0 gloo >.up e9ksm 39 20I.3.9u

The extension’s first floor 
and basement will contain 
classrooms and new social 
spaces for students and faculty 
including an outdoor patio. “The 
small lounge on the second 
floor will be destroyed and a 
new lounge, of approximately the 
same size, will be on the first 
floor. There will also be a coffee 
bar in the basement,” said 
Stearns. “We’re excited about 
the social aspect. The setup will 
be quite nice where people will 
^e able to hold casual activities 
^nd gatherings.”
When the new extension is com­
plete and the Psychology Depart­
ment has moved some of its of­
fices and laboratories from Baker
Hall to the extension, the depart­
ment will leave behind unoccu­
pied space. “There is a big expan­
sion in statistics research that 
there is just no room for,” said 
Stearns. “Statistics won’t be in 
the new wing, l?ut they will get 
extra space associated with the 
new wing.”
Stearns also noted that H&SS 
will indirectly gain additional 
space with the construction of 
the Purnell Center. “When 
Purnell is completed, that will 
free up space,” said Stearns. “Ul­
timately design facilities will be 
moved into Purnell, and we will 
renovate the space [in the base­
ment of Porter Hall] completely.
While new academic spaces will 
be created, parking spaces will be
destroyed when the new wing 
is built. “We told Parking about 
this a long time ago,” said 
Stearns. “People will be put into 
other lots.” He said that to 
his knowledge Parking has to 
date made no plans to create 
new spaces. Stearns added that 
the extension couldn’t be 
constructed further down Frew 
Street because the incline is 
too great.
The Board of Trustees will meet 
in April to decide whether or not 
to give the project approval. If the 
Baker Hall extension is approved, 
there will be two ground 
breaking ceremonies, and then 
construction will begin later this 
year and be complete by the fall 
of 2000.

By SRINIVAS PULLELA
Tartan Staffwriter
Beginning next year, prospective stu­
dents interested in the First Year Part­
nership program (FYP) will have to do 
more than just checking a box on their 
housing applications. The addition of a 
more involved application process is one 
of several changes that the Office of 
Student Life has proposed for the FYP 
program next academic year.
FYP is a mentoring program open to 
any incoming first-year student who 
would like the benefit of being partnered 
with either a faculty or staff member for 
his or her first year on campus. By pro­
viding the student with a resource on 
campus, the program aims to facilitate 
students’ transition into university life.
“The faculty or staff partner’s role is to 
help the student build connections and 
help him navigate the resources of the 
community,” said Lisa Dingman, coor­
dinator of Student Lifefor the First Year 
Experience. “The goal of the program is 
the relationship between the student 
and the partner. They can develop this 
relationship by having lunch, having 
dinner, going to hockey games, or just 
taking a walk on campus.”
In reviewing the program this year, 
however, the Student Life Office found 
that there were cases in which both 
students and faculty showed a lack of 
commitment to FYP.
“I haven’t even seen or heard from my 
partner all year,” said first-year student 
chemical engineering major Luis 
Carvajal. “I think my partner is a he.”
According to Dingman, the application 
process for FYP, which consisted of check­
ing a box on the housing application, was 
short and generated response from many 
students, some of whom were not com­
pletely informed about the program.
“Students aren’t always aware of what 
they’re getting into when they apply to 
FYP,” said Kelly Lie, coordinator of stu­
dent life.
According to Dingman, students have, 
in some cases, chosen FYP because of
their parents’ wishes, or primarily for 
the housing options, which are currently 
Morewood Gardens E-Tower and 
Hamerschlag Hall. As a result, there are 
candidates that enter the program with­
out a sense of commitment.
The Student Life Office has proposed 
several changes to address this prob­
lem. According to Dingman, next year’s 
FYP will be smaller and more decentral­
ized. The program will be downsized 
from its current size of about 375 stu­
dents to between 100 and 150 students. 
In addition, FYP students will not be 
restricted by housing. Dingman feels 
that this change will allow for more 
outreach to those students living in the 
Oakland Apartments.
“By having FYP students more spread 
out across campus, non-FYP people will 
have a chance to benefit from those in 
the program,” said Renee Camerlengo, 
director of Student Life.
The program will also be made more 
selective by requiring interested candi­
dates to submit a brief application.
“We’ll be asking students to write a 
short paragraph to apply for the pro­
gram: ask what their ambitions are and 
what they expect for their first year,” 
said Dingman.
According to Dingman, to shift the focus 
to strengthening the student-partner re­
lationship, the program will have stu­
dents paired with both a faculty and a 
staff partner, rather than just one. In 
addition, the faculty partners will have an 
affiliation similar to that of their students.
Dingman said, “For example, a stu­
dent who is a pre-med major will be 
paired with a biology MCS faculty 
member — so that gives them a given 
shared interest.”
Dingman is optimistic about the 
changes for next year. “We’re focusing 
on the people who have time to commit 
to the program, both from the faculty 
and staff side and the student side. We 
hope to have a better matching process 
so that the people who are participating 
are able to get a full experience from it,” 
said Dingman.

ary degrees would be a bit much for 
the ceremony.
Last year, the President and a gradu­
ating student gave speeches. “Al­
though there is no perfect model, my 
sense is that the highlighting of the 
President’s speech and the graduat­
ing student’s speech was very nice last 
year,” said Murphy. “Coupled with the 
réintroduction of the honorary degree 
initiative, it should prove to be a Very 
nice combination.”
In 1997, Raymond Smith, 1959 
graduate of GSIA in industrial man­
agement, and chairman and CEO of 
Bell Atlantic, gave the keynote ad­
dress. Since then, graduation has been 
cut down in length, and there is no 
longer a distinguished alumni speaker.
The graduation ceremony will be 
held in Gesling Stadium. This year, 
the entire ceremony will last one 
hour, along with half an hour for the 
procession of seniors. “It used to be 
under the tent on the Cut and lasted 
a solid two hours,” said Maryanne 
Moore, director of Special Events. “A 
group of us completely re-evaluated
the ceremony to make it as interesting 
and meaningful as possible. Dr. Cohon 
felt that the honorary degree program 
was important and will be brought 
back this year.”
Most students feel that the gradua­
tion length is fine and are looking for­
ward to the ceremony. “I think that it’s 
fine that it’s shorter,” said senior biology 
major Alice Chong. “We’ll get our diplo­
mas and graduate.”
“I really don’t mind that it’s shorter,” 
said Jon Auchter, senior information sys­
tems and computer science major. “I am 
looking forward to getting my diploma.” 
However, other students feel that it’s 
too short. “I believe that the ceremony is 
a little too short,” said Igor Radovilsky, 
a senior computer science major. “I’d 
like to see other people talking — per­
haps some other deans.”
Students also feel that the keynote 
address should be given by someone 
else. “I feel that the keynote speaker 
should be given by somebody other than 
Cohon,” said Lou Chômas, a first-year 
physics major. “They should bring back 
distinguished alumni or bring a re­
nowned speaker to the ceremony.”
The goal of the graduation commit­
tee has been to make the event as^ 
meaningful as possible for the stu­
dents, while also tightening up the 
entire ceremony. In addition to work 
on the structure and content of the 
ceremony, they have also worked out 
contingency plans based on different 
weather situations. “If there is a slight 
drizzle, then we will continue with the 
ceremony,” said Moore. “However, if 
there is a tremendous downpour, 
President Cohon will give a shortened 
version of the speech and the 
diplomas will be distributed in 
corresponding smaller ceremonies.”
The location of the ceremony was of 
some concern to people. In previous 
years, it used to take place on the Cut. 
However, last year was the first time 
that it took place in Gesling Stadium. 
“I feel it went very well,” said Moore.
Commencement cap and gown dis­
tribution for students and faculty will 
take place May 12 to 16 in the McKenna 
Peter Wright Room in the University 
Center. The commencement ceremony 
will take place from 11 am to noon in 
Gesling Stadium.
SDC elects new president, vice president
SDC, from page 1
biological sciences and the 1997-1998 
SDC president. My advice to all presi­
dents have been to create some kind of 
strategic plan for the upcoming year 
that he can refer to to prioritize what 
needs to get done and what he wants 
to get done.”
Crane’s assistant in these activities will 
be Elker, who said of his new position, “It 
feels really good [to be elected vice presi­
dent] because the entire organization has 
a vision and, as vice president, I can have 
a greater role in carrying that vision out.” 
Elker also became involved with SDC 
during his freshman year, and then be­
came chair of the Films Committee.
“Part of being vice president entails 
membership. 'That is, taking members 
we already have, pushing them forward 
and making them leaders, and also get­
ting new members,” said Elker. He said
he wants to make SDC a more social 
organization, allowing the members to 
get done what they want to do, as well as 
go out and have a good time together.
“One of the biggest speed bumps we 
have is interaction with other organiza­
tions,” said Elker. “We need to work a 
lot more with other organizations on 
campus, such as Senate,”
While Elker has his own goals for 
SDC, he said that he saw the president 
as the one who sets the mission and the 
vice president as the one who gets sup­
port for the plans from the general body 
of SDC. “I’m the one who goes out and 
gets everyone together to partake in 
this vision,” he said.
Migliore has much respect for Elker, 
who has been Films chairperson this 
past year. “Justin is an excellent can­
didate. He has an objective mindset 
and is good at working with people
and getting them involved,” he said. 
“Films last semester had the highest 
attendance ever. We almost broke 
even on the cost of the movies, and the 
leader of [the] Committee definitely 
stands out.”
“[Justin] maintains a professional at­
mosphere and also does a great job of 
listening to what people have to say. He 
is a true asset and always tends to have 
a cool head,” said Crane.
“One of my main accomplishments is 
getting SDC members to feel important 
and get out and make the experience 
more than just something to put on 
their resume,” said Elker.
Crane is eager to get residents more 
involved with the organization. “I hope 
to get the message to residents what 
SDC can do to help them and provide to 
them,” he said. “I want to help residents 
know what’s going on.”

(Pi
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
PUTTING TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS.
E
very year, a lot of people make a 
huge mistake on their taxes. 
They wind up sending Uncle Sam 
money they could be saving for 
retirement.
Fortunately, that’s a mistake you 
can avoid with SRAs —tax-deferred 
annuities from TIAA-CREF. SRAs not 
only ease your current tax bite, they 
offer an easy way to build retirement 
income—especially for the “extras" 
that your pension and Social Security 
benefits may not cover. Because your 
contributions are made in pretax 
dollars, you pay less in taxes now. And 
since earnings on your SRAs are tax
deferred, your money works even 
harder for you.
Today, we offer other before- and 
after-tax financial solutions, including 
IRAs and mutual funds. They’re 
backed by the same investment exper­
tise, low expenses, and personal 
service that have made TIAA-CREF 
the choice oi Americas educational and 
research community.
Why write off the chance for a 
more rewarding retirement? Stop by

Most major colleges and univer­
sities across the nation have made 
it tradition to bring writers, politi­
cians, and other prominent pro­
fessionals to speak at their gradu­
ation ceremonies. However, forthe 
second year in a row, CMU has 
opted out of this tradition. As a 
university with an exceptional 
reputation, Carnegie Mellon 
should make it a point to include a 
speaker from outside the campus 
community in such an important 
ceremony.
In place of a keynote speaker at 
last year’s commencement, Presi­
dent Cohon and one graduating 
senior spoke during the ceremony. 
That year, many changes were 
made to the traditional program 
to tighten it up and shorten what 
can be a lengthy occasion. While 
wanting to keep the ceremony from 
becoming an interminable event 
is understandable, sacrificing the 
opportunity for seniors to hear 
from a prominent speaker during 
such a turning point in their lives 
is not worth the 15 minutes that 
would be shaved off the total time. 
Already, the doctoral hooding has 
been cut out of the proceedings 
and moved to Saturday in an ef­
fort to save time — there’s no need 
to further shorten the ceremony, 
especially with such an important 
aspect of it at stake.
While President Cohon is a 
prominent figure on campus, as 
well as a distinguished public 
speaker, having a keynote speaker 
from outside the Carnegie Mellon
community has many benefits to a 
graduating class. A well-known 
speaker makes commencement ex­
ercises all the more memorable 
for the graduates and their fami­
lies, who come to CMU from 
around the world to see the cer­
emony. It also makes the ceremony 
a more personalized occasion for 
each successive class. In past 
years, Carnegie Mellon has had 
several notable alumni give the 
speech, including actor Jack 
Klugman and Hollywood producer 
Steven Bochco. Having a keynote 
speaker who is not a member of 
the campus community gives 
graduates the chance to hear a 
new perspective from someone 
they likely haven’t seen or heard 
before as they prepare to leave the 
University behind.
While having a prestigious key­
note speaker would benefit the 
students, it should be kept in mind 
that commencement is not merely 
a lecture given by a famous alum­
nus. It is an excellent outlet for 
reinforcing traditions at the Uni­
versity, and a good deal of effort 
should be taken to ensure that the 
ceremony as a whole is a memo­
rable, momentous occasion for all 
involved. It may be too late to find 
a new keynote speaker for this 
year’s ceremony, but next year’s 
class of graduating seniors should 
become involved in the organiza­
tional process and persuade the 
University to incorporate a no­
table speaker into the commence­
ment proceedings.

At a campus as stratified as 
CMUs, students often entertain 
themselves by pursuing interests 
that they share with only a few 
others. Yet, even with the rainbow 
of interests and backgrounds that 
make up the student body, the Ac­
tivities Board (AB) consistently 
manages to plan appealing, timely, 
and quality events. Thanks to AB’s 
efforts over the past year, CMU has 
enjoyed well-known political speak­
ers, bands, comedy troupes, and 
artists. What’s more, students are 
always able to attend these events 
for a reasonable price, and, in many 
cases, for free. AB should be com­
mended for its success in providing 
campus with reasonably priced, 
high-quality entertainment.
AB’s success can be measured in 
several ways. First, the organiza­
tion brings events diverse enough 
to please everyone to campus. In 
the past year, we have had con­
certs from bands like Man... or 
Astro-man?, They Might Be Gi­
ants, and others, covering a wide 
range of musical tastes, as well as 
speakers such as Henry Rollins, 
Art Spiegelman, and Michael 
Moore. For those who want a good 
laugh, we’ve been visited by the 
Upright Citizens Brigade, Andy 
Richter, and Norm McDonald. In 
the future, there will be a talk by 
Douglas Adams, the author of the 
bestselling Hitchhiker’s Guide to 
the Galaxy books.
AB is also responsible for the 
infamously funny Sunday night 
movie lineup, which has included 
Drunken Master, Planet of the
Apes, and a night of Saturday 
morning cartoons. The organiza­
tion also puts on the Thursday 
and Friday night films, which 
cater to different audiences — 
Thursday’s films are often of a 
more cultural nature, while Fri­
day nights offer a selection of box- 
office hits soon after they leave 
the theaters. It is this ability to 
suit a variety of students’ tastes 
that is key to AB’s success.
These performances are priced 
reasonably for students, and 
they’re very effectively publicized, 
something that is all too lacking 
from many other events on cam­
pus. AB’s posters are well-placed, 
informative, and eye-catching, 
generally standing out of the mass 
of other posters that surround 
them. Their postering efforts 
blanket campus, and in some 
cases have extended a few blocks 
into surrounding areas.
The fact that AB has brought 
such big names and done such an 
excellent job with publicity while 
keeping events so cheap is a tes­
tament to their effectiveness. 
Given the many difficult tasks 
that AB pulls off to bring enter­
tainment to CMU, its members 
deserve to be commended. 
Through their efforts, the cam­
pus has seen a plethora of inter­
esting and appealing events in 
the past, and will see many more 
in the future. All in all, AB de­
serves praise, and remains, to 
date, one of the most effective 
spenders on campus of your Ac­
tivities Fee.

A recent article in 
The Tartan calling for 
world domination 
[“United States should 
shoot for world domi­
nance,” March 8] made the false claim, 
among others, that China was far be­
hind in nuclear weapons technology. A 
recent New York Times article reported 
that the exact opposite was true: Our 
most advanced nuclear technology re­
search had been acquired by China — 
technology allowing for the attack of 
multiple cities from a single missile. 
This fact alone is cause enough to con­
clude that there is a genuine threat to 
the U.S. if China were to be properly 
antagonized, and so the need for a strong 
defense is clear.
The article’s call for world domination 
is also a claim reminiscent of Hitler’s 
call for “breathing room,” or expansion 
of Germany, earlier this century. It calls 
for the spread of the ideas of the great 
American experiment by force. But one 
of the foundations of this experiment is 
freedom, and as such it is a clear contra­
diction to call for its ideas of freedom and
self-determination to be spread by the 
use of force.

Editor:
The Tartan editorial 
“Student Senate must 
improve efficiency” 
[March 8] is correct in 
highlighting the lack 
of leadership Senate has suffered this 
semester. However, in its comments, 
The Tartan has failed to understand the 
causes of this problem, focusing instead 
on effects.
Robert’s Rules of Order is a popular 
target when meetings become long or 
tedious. For those who are not used to 
this procedure, a Senate meeting may 
seem confusing or bizarre. With proper 
guidance, however, Robert’s Rules pro­
vide the only fair and efficient way to 
conduct business. In our most recent 
meeting, Senate finished more business 
in less time, an accomplishment we 
all celebrated.
The Tartan’s focus on Robert’s Rules 
offers the wrong impression to 
students. Its comments into why some 
officers have resigned were also inap­
propriate. Would The Tartan prefer 
that the officers continue to allow their 
personal conflicts to interfere with 
their responsibilities?
The Tartan Editorial Board has made 
a mountain out of a molehill. Senate has 
encountered unusual difficulties this 
year. But it is a testament to the 
dedication of the elected officials of 
Student Government that despite these 
problems, the needs of students are 
still being addressed. JFC budget pro­
posals, organization recognition, and the 
PAT referendum are all examples of 
the dedication of your officers in 
Student Government.
While The Tartan is correct to point 
out the problems Senate has encoun­
tered this semester, the reasons The 
Tartan gives for those problems do a 
disservice to our constituents. I 
encourage all members of the campus 
community to contact your Senator(s), 
visit a Senate meeting, and form your 
own opinion of our efforts on 
your behalf.

You’ve no doubt by now heard 
of the new PETA (People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals) 
advertising campaign. Consist­
ing largely of a nationwide slew 
of billboards, it loudly proclaims 
that “Jesus was a vegetarian.” 
Supported by assertions that 
God loves all his creatures and 
abhors the pain and suffering 
caused by our meat industry, 
the campaign has drawn con­
troversy from around the coun­
try, getting completely banned 
from at least one city.
This would be an important 
issue for me, except that I am 
neither a Christian nor a veg­
etable. But consider the possi­
bilities opened up by such a cam­
paign. It has long been known 
that religion blinds an inquir­
ing mind and makes the masses 
easy to control. For centuries, 
that control has rested solely in 
the hands of a predominantly 
responsible and conscientious 
clergy who would ask mostly 
that their congregations be 
moral, humble people, and who 
only occasionally bum a witch 
in an orgiastic outpouring of 
repressed sexuality.
But the PETA campaign 
shows that with modern adver­
tising, any group with an agenda 
can play the shepherd to the 
Christian flock. The old adver­
tising tactics of peer pressure, 
sex appeal, and outright lying 
have become overplayed and
transparent to the consumer. 
Capitalist marketing must 
find new ways to deceive. Re­
ligion is a deeply held and 
rarely questioned belief held 
by the vast majority of people 
throughout the world; I’m sur­
prised it took this long for ad­
vertising to sink low enough 
to connect products and ideas 
to a religious icon.
the maker and no less than 
how much it was needed by 
the buyer — dominated the 
economics of Christendom. For 
a long time, banking was a 
profession deemed off-limits to 
Christians. Jesus would be 
rolling over in his grave if he 
knew how many Christians 
today run banks and engage in 
other capitalist trade. Accord-
"The PETA campaign shows that 
with modern advertisingany 
group with an agenda can piay 
shepherd to the Christian flock.”
One of the many groups that 
could derive the ideological 
benefits, as well as reap the 
rewards of its very irony, 
would be the Communist 
Party of America. Imagine the 
ad campaign: “Jesus was a 
communist.” It’s far more 
likely to presume this than to 
presume that he was a veg­
etarian (since the reason he 
didn’t eat meat was probably 
more related to his being poor), 
and to cite various apocryphal 
pieces of evidence about Jesus 
belongingto some ancient veg­
etarian group. It’s well-docu­
mented in the Bible that Jesus 
and his disciples shared their 
property and earnings. Also, 
Jesus was quite unambigu­
ous when he threw the money­
changers out of the temple. 
Throughout the Middle Ages, 
the Christian ideal of a “fair 
price” — no more than it cost
ingto the Bible, capitalists will 
burn in hell. Why? Because 
capitalism fundamentally re­
quires one to “covet,” and “thou 
shalt not covet.”
Marketing through religion 
has been growing the past 
few years, most notably with 
the spread of “What Would 
Jesus Do?” (WWJD) bracelets. 
Indeed, if Jesus was no 
capitalist, he would frown 
upon one selling such brace­
lets, but instead beseech that 
one give the bracelet to he who 
needeth it most. But forget 
that, and let’s let modern 
marketing get on with its bas­
tardization. Coca-Cola could 
buy out the company that 
produces such bracelets, and 
we’d have bracelets saying 
“What Would Jesus Do? 
Drink Coca-Cola.” Hooters 
Restaurants could pay the 
Catholic Church for advertis-
ing rights and exclusive in­
cathedral diners; both par­
ties would benefit. Hooters 
would gain sole rights to 
open an an eatery within 
easy access of hungry 
parishioners, and the 
Catholic Church could 
probably win back some of 
its disgruntled now- 
Protestant demographic 
with their new image: 
“The Catholic Church — 
we’ve made a couple of 
big changes.”
Detractors have long 
called religions like 
Scientology, which charge 
members exorbitant 
amounts to rise within its 
ranks, money-making 
scams. If God doth bless 
this country and the 
Republican rhetoric is 
right about the capitalist 
American way, then 
Scientology is ahead of its 
time. PETA, “Jesus was a 
vegetarian,” and the inevi­
table religion-related 
marketing deluge that will 
soon follow are just play­
ing catch-up. My pre­
scient declaration goes out 
to those who would stay 
atop the market: Forget 
about investing in high 
technology, computers, 
or the Internet. Religion 
is the cash cow of 
the future.
Yishan Wong is im­
pressed at how he can 
somehow turn any issue 
into an excuse to bash 
capitalism.

Standardization ensures consistency
Open Forum
by Becca Fribush
I’ll admit it—I have a thing for fast food. 
Try as I might to quell my cravings, there 
have been times when I’ve had no 
choice but to venture down Forbes Avenue 
into the wilds of Oakland in search of 
a McDonald’s Crispy Chicken Deluxe 
and fries.
Some lucky students don’t have nearly 
as far to go when they hear the siren call 
of saturated fat. More and more colleges 
are turning to large corporations to sup­
ply food on campus. Schools like Boston 
University and the University of Mary­
land now offer Burger King, Pizza Hut, or 
other fast food places in their student 
unions, and DePaul University in Chi­
cago recently put a big grocery store with 
a cafeteria—all run by the second-largest 
supermarket chain in Illinois — inside 
one of its dormitories. Even the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh offers Pizza Hut pizzas 
at one of its dining halls and allows its 
PittFunds to be used at many of the fast- 
food places conveniently located right near 
the campus.
Does this trend mean that there’s a 
McDonald’s in CMU’s future? Definitely 
not now. The school’s current University 
Center food-service policy favors local ven­
dors; the places in the University Center 
food court tend to be either University- 
run vendors like Chic-Hens or branches of 
local restaurants like Ali Baba. In order to 
even consider bringing national chains to 
campus, CMU would likely have to change 
this policy. But as large food corporations 
spread across the campus landscape faster 
than a speeding burger, it’s worth exam­
ining the attractions of franchises.
There does seem to be a certain disturb­
ing element to this trend at first. Cer­
tainly there’s something that could be said 
for how food places run by universities can 
shape themselves to fit the needs 
of the school. And so many neighborhoods 
are dominated by the same chain food 
places that it’s kind of comforting to think 
of college campuses as islands of indepen­
dent dining, even if that translates to 
dining halls full of limp spaghetti and 
half-melted frozen yogurt. So it’s a little 
disconcerting to think of big corporate 
places plunked down on campuses across 
America to take advantage of a captive 
audience of students.
But the truth is that any dining service 
that serves college students is poised to 
take advantage of the combination of lazi­
ness, meal plans, and distance from other 
options that forces students to fulfill most 
of their food needs on campus. For CMU 
students, this reality results in a steady 
stream of “O” fries and Si Señor burritos. At 
Boston University, it means Burger King 
and Taco Bell. Clearly, Boston’s got the 
better end of the deal.
If you’re stuck getting most of your food in 
one place, it might as well be good. A place 
like McDonald’s is used to standardizing 
its services to ensure that every Quarter 
Pounder or order of Super-Size fries served 
at every one of its thousands of locations is 
as deliciously greasy as the last. Fast food 
isn’t gourmet by any stretch of the imagina­
tion, but it manages at least to consistently 
taste good. Which is a pretty impressive
feat compared to the parade of soggy veg­
etables, stringy chicken, and adhesive-glue 
cheesecake that makes up the typical college 
dining experience.
Besides the taste issue, there are other 
obvious reasons why outposts of big chains 
are often suited for serving the demands of 
college campuses. They’re accustomed to 
having to get a lot of people fed in short 
periods of time in ways that smaller opera­
tions might not be. For example, McDonald’s 
trains its new workers with written tests and 
lots of other experience to ensure that no one 
gets behind the counter without knowing 
exactly what they’re doing. Smaller vendors 
don’t necessarily have the resources to put 
their workers through such training. And If 
you don’t have much experience cooking for
College campuses are looking a lot 
more like shopping malls these days. 
Well, maybe not the entire mall yet, but 
at least the food court area, with its 
multitude of household-name eateries 
lit up in neon — Burger King, Sbarro, 
and Taco Bell, with their cuddly,
people in a hurry, it can’t be fun to find 
yourself facing a line of 40 hungry students, 
all of whom have 40 minutes to get to class 
and 40 pages of reading to finish beforehand.
The mere possibility of outsourcing food to 
big corporations can also serve as a tasty 
bargaining chip. The increased competition 
and the threat of being replaced should en­
courage campus food services to improve 
quality and go to greater lengths to make 
students well-fed and happy.
People upset about the prospect of the likes 
of Wendy’s and Sbarro competing with stu­
dent dining halls might want to look a little 
more at who’s actually running those dining 
halls. In many cases — including, until a few 
years ago, our very own Highlander — the 
halls are managed by an arm of the giant 
hospitality corporation Sodexho Marriott 
Services. So there’s been a corporate pres­
ence in college dining for a long time. Only 
now that franchises are on the scene, it’s at 
least resulting in foods that are comparable 
to what you’d end up eating off campus.
Maybe someday CMU will follow suit 
and the UC will host a fast food place of its 
own. Until then, my fried chicken dreams 
will just have to be satisfied down near Pitt. 
Or perhaps at Boston University.

vendors to make sure it’s okay to bring 
in the respective retailer. For example, 
before any golden arches can set foot 
on the Cut, every single owner of 
every single nearby McDonald’s has 
to approve, which probably won’t 
happen. Considering that this cam-
Ooen Forum Pus *s urt>an> with many fast ^ food joints nearby, these negotiation
by Greg Nofi processes are more trouble than 
they’re worth. That’s why this trend 
is actually beginning to slow down on 
college campuses.
Another issue is health. Students 
are put on a meal plan freshman year 
so mama and papa don’t lose sleep 
thinking about their child’s nutrition 
at school. Currently, if you look past 
the “0” fries, there are many healthy 
options on campus. That’s because 
the food is usually prepared locally 
and then brought to its on-campus 
vendor to sell to you. As we all 
know, however, fast food is super­
processed and super-fried in buck­
ets of oil. The “meat” is of question­
able quality.- And then there’s the 
urban legend of that girl whose 
salivary glands became infested 
with roach eggs after eating a 
chicken taco from Taco Bell. Be­
lieve it or not, you’ll ultimately see 
students clenching their stomachs 
at the thought of an Extra 
Value Meal.
Then there are the CMU stu­
dents with frugal appetites who 
contend that prices at such places 
are much lower than the ones at 
the current UC vendors, for in­
stance. True, nothing beats a “two 
double cheeseburgers for two 
dollars” deal, even if one single 
cheeseburger will cost almost 
as much at as the Original Hot 
Dog Shop.
But, for those who have not 
taken Principles of Economics, let 
me speak a little bit about supply 
and demand. You have 30 minutes 
until your next class and it’s time 
to eat lunch. A half-hour is 
certainly not enough time to run off 
campus and grab a meal. So you’re 
forced to stay and eat on campus. 
Fast food places know this, and 
subsequently jack up the price of 
their goods on college campuses to 
screw over already broke students. If 
you don’t think they can do this, 
check out the prices at a McDonald’s 
rest stop along a highway where 
the restaurants capitalize on 
their convenience.
The choice is clear. If you want to

But who cares about all this commer- overtaking America — “McDonald’s,”

some less distant reasons why CMU 
shouldn’t turn into a drive-thru for “fran­
chise-branded concepts.”
I’m sure there are those who would

Many schools across the nation are 
overthrowing their beloved lunch ladies 
and bringing in such vendors. It’s all 
part of a rampant commercial move­
ment that has been exponentially grow­
ing and is now as American as 
McDonald’s apple pie.
Right now, CMU brings in local ven­
dors to cater to the community. Such

everywhere. Even in small neighbor­

CMU students tired of the existing din­
ing options and who would prefer a fast 
food chain anyway. But it’s hardly worth 
it to bring in all of these big-name ven­
dors if consumers will eventually yawn 
over the selection.
Franchises charge high up-front fees 
to set up shop. In addition to paying 
these ghastly initial fees, CMU will also 
have to negotiate with local off-campus

By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Special Projects Manager
For a team with no adminis­
tration, tons of youth, and a 
new coach, the men’s volleyball 
club is close to wrapping up its 
third full season stronger than 
ever. The team’s most recent 
action featured a weekend tri­
match March 6 versus Allegh­
eny College and Akron Univer­
sity at Allegheny.
“[Going into the match], we 
expected to do well,” said junior 
Kevin Daily. “We were pumped 
and ready to go.”
“We had played [Allegheny] 
last year and really beat them,” 
said senior Carl Zukas. “This 
year they had an older team 
than us, and we still beat them.”
The Tartans were coming off 
a loss to Geneva highlighted by 
a game neither team seemed 
able to win. Geneva finally held 
a rally just long enough to earn 
a 21-19 victory.
After taking care of Allegh­
eny, the team faltered against 
Akron. As a team, CMlTs level 
of play in the Akron match was 
well below the standards it has 
become accustomed to this sea­
son. The team left the Allegh­
eny matches with one win, one 
loss, and a myriad of unan­
swered questions about their 
inconsistent play.
Based on previous perfor­
mances during the season, the 
team refused to stay down fol­
lowing their poor showing 
against Akron. “One of the 
things we did well over the sea­
son was addressing our prob­
lems in previous matches,” said 
Zukas. “The next match we 
would either improve or fix it.”
Unfortunately, the team has 
to wait a while to test that 
theory. After having a home 
tournament last weekend 
canceled, the team is now 
preparing to finish off their sea­
son this weekend against 
Westminster College.
With most of the season over, 
many team members are look­
ing back on a season that fea­
tured many highs and lows.
“We had a lot of problems 
this year with having a stable 
squad,” said Daily. “At the 
beginning of the year we 
were looking really good but a 
number of people had to 
drop because of school or 
work or whatever. This is 
CMU, and school does take 
more precedence.”
“[The instability in the ros­
ter] makes playing a little bit 
rough because you go into a 
game not knowing who would 
be playing a certain position,” 
said Zukas.
This instability led to a de­
gree of chaos on court. “Even 
with the people that did play, 
the season didn’t go very 
smoothly,” said Daily.
Nevertheless, the team is 
looking toward next year with 
a good deal of optimism.
“I think we have really good 
team chemistry — especially 
among the core players,” said 
Daily. “We always have prob­
lems getting funding, finding 
court time, and organizing 
tournaments, but it always 
seems like the core of guys are 
able to pull through and get 
things done.”
“When I came in as a fresh­
man, we didn’t even play in a 
league, just tournaments.... I 
think that it’s great we’ve ad­
vanced to this point,” said 
Zukas. “Our ultimate goal is 
to become a varsity sport.”
“A club is amazingly more 
difficult than varsity,” said 
Daily. “In a varsity sport, you 
have a team manager and 
coach, and all you really have 
to do is show up and play. 
With a club sport, all players 
have to come together and do 
things like get court time and 
transportation.”
Without looking too far 
ahead, Daily said he believes 
that there are bright times 
ahead for the men’s volleyball 
club. “Next year I think we are 
going to do a lot better than 
this. A couple of key players 
that were not able to play this 
year will return, so that will 
put us in good shape.”

Put on your tight-fitting shoes 
and lace them up. Pull up those 
thin shorts that barely cover a 
third of your thigh. Get ready to 
sprint, hurdle, jump, and throw 
as the CMU track and field teams 
begin the 1999 spring season.
After a mediocre performance 
during the indoor track season, 
both the men’s and women’s 
teams are ready to get back to the 
preferred outdoor style. With the 
outdoor season looming, both the 
men’s and women’s teams have 
several questions that need to be 
addressed for them to be com­
petitive this year.
“We didn’t do too well at the 
indoor championship.... We’re 
not going to set our goals too 
high,” said Dario Donatelli, head 
coach of the women’s track team. 
“I think we’re just starting to 
get in shape for now, and just 
getting some needed rest for the 
outdoor season.” Donatelli 
stressed the need to keep healthy
with a long way to go.
“Now that we’re in the 
middle of the pack 
with the other teams, 
we can usually finish 
fourth or fifth,” he 
said. Next year, CMU 
will be graduating four 
seniors who currently 
provide key leadership 
for an otherwise young 
team. The team’s suc­
cess this season will 
be determined by the 
performance of a few 
key individuals.
Senior thrower Alice 
Chong, a biology ma­
jor, had a good indoor 
season, placing sixth 
in the shot put at the 
UAA championships, 
and second in the in­
door weight. Chong 
currently holds the 
school record. Donatelli also ex­
pects senior art major Margaret 
Powers, the defending conference 
champion in the 1,500-meter 
event, to defend her title. 
Maureen McGranaghan, a senior 
BHA major, is expected to per- 
during the period between the ' form well in the distance races.

The men’s track and field team will look to rebound from last season’s frustrating 
fifth-place finish when the season begins after spring break.
indoor and outdoor seasons. “I’m 
trying to keep them motivated 
now,” he said.
In addition, Donatelli said that 
he hopes the weather clears up 
for their first meet, which will be 
a home invitational with an ex­
pected 15 other teams to be held 
on April 3.
When comparing CMU to the 
rest of the UAA, Donatelli ranked 
the Tartans as improving,'but
The women’s events to keep an 
eye on this season include the 
5,000-meter, the 10,000-meter, 
the women’s hammer throw, and 
the women’s quarter mile.
On the men’s side, this year’s 
squad will be looking to rebound 
from a lackluster 1998 season 
that witnessed a sub-par perfor­
mance by the majority of the team.

cal engineering major and 5,000-
Putting the disappointing indoor season behind them, the women’s track team is

meter runner, summed up the 
frustration last year’s team expe­
rienced. “We were second [in the 
UAA] two years ago, but we 
dropped to fifth last year, which 
was disappointing,” he said.
Heading into this season, the 
main goal in everyone’s mind is 
to simply improve on last year’s 
result. “We’d like to finish in the 
top half this year,” Oldham said. 
Meeting that goal would place 
the team fourth in the eight- 
team UAA field, but that is the 
absolute minimum finish the 
team will accept.
Though the core of the team 
remains from last year, several 
losses to graduation could prove 
to be setbacks in the struggle for 
position in the UAA. 
“Many of our jump­
ers that had been 
some of our top per­
formers in the past 
have graduated,” 
said senior javelin 
thrower and indus­
trial management 
major Jonathan 
Stein.
Stein will be one of 
the many athletes on 
the team who will 
need to step up to fill 
the empty spots left 
by the graduation of 
consistent perform­
ers. One of the top 
javelin throwers in 
the UAA, he will be 
expected to
some points for the Tartans in 
the UAAs.
In evaluating the team’s rela­
tive strengths and weaknesses 
for the coming season, the weak­
nesses appear to outnumber the 
strengths. With the graduation 
of key jumpers, the already-sus- 
pect field events were dealt a se­
vere blow, and other crucial parts 
of the team face the same situa­
tion. “In the sprints we tend to be 
weaker than the rest of the con­
ference,” Stein said.
Despite the expected troubles, 
the team is not overly concerned. 
The saving grace for the team 
this season may be the perenni­
ally strong distance team, built 
form the perennially strong cross 
country team. “Our middle-dis- 
tance and distance runners are 
very competitive,” Stein said. 
“We’ll have a number of finishers 
in the top eight [in the UAA] from 
that group.”
Despite the expected success of 
Stein and the distance runners, 
it will take much more for the 
team to achieve their goal of 
improving on last season’s 
disappointing turn of events. 
Each and every member of the 
team will have to step into a domi­
nant role and give outstanding 
performances, or this spring will 
be a cloudy sea son regardless of 
the weather.

The Basketball
by Pete Patterson
This is the time of the year that NCAA 
basketball should be basking in its own 
glory. The NBA never catches the atten­
tion of casual fans until playoff time, 
and pro baseball teams are all in Florida 
or Arizona preparing for the upcoming 
season. That leaves college hoops with 
the most exciting event in all of sports, 
the NCAA tournament, holding the full 
attention of the sporting world.
The action on the court in the first 
round of the tournament has not disap­
pointed, with the usual slate of exciting 
games and bracket-busting upsets. Who 
could have foreseen tiny Weber State 
beating the mighty North Carolina Tar 
Heels? One could not help but be amazed 
by the 43 points scored by Wally 
Szczerbiak in the Miami (Ohio) upset of 
seventh-seeded Washington. Or was it 
an upset? Every number-10 seed in the 
tournament won its first-round game. 
Southwest Missouri State, coached by 
ex-Indiana Hoosier Steve Alford, made 
this the 11th consecutive year at least 
one number-12 seed has won its first- 
round game, despite only equaling the 
score Szczerbiak had by himself in a 43- 
32 defeat of Wisconsin.
As expected, high seeds such as Duke, 
Michigan State, Connecticut, Cincinnati, 
and others blew out their first-round 
competition, setting the stage for the 
possibility of excellent matchups to come 
in the later rounds. How­
ever, the NCAA discovered 
that the glare of the spot­
light can expose flaws as 
well as elicit praise, and 
college basketball is an ex­
tremely flawed entity. The 
largest bombshell of the 
week came on the eve of the 
first round when a former 
employee of the Minnesota 
Golden Gophers basketball 
department claimed that 
she had performed take- 
home tests and written pa­
pers for 20 former and cur­
rent players. The accusa­
tions could not be dismissed 
as the slander of a dis­
gruntled former employee, 
as several past Gophers con­
fessed to having work done 
for them. Many, including 
Minnesota governor Jesse 
Ventura, questioned the 
timing of the release of this 
information, but it may be 
for the best in that the large amount of 
attention attracted will force the prob­
lem to be dealt with.
Anyone who thinks this type of activ­
ity is rare is naive. Who can forget the 
allegations of similar occurrences at 
UNLV a few years ago, when a paper 
handed in by star Isaiah Rider mysteri­
ously had his name misspelled? How­
ever, due to the outlaw reputation of the 
Runnin’ Rebel program and then-coach 
Jerry Tarkanian, the problem was 
viewed as an isolated instance rather
than an epidemic. However, now that 
similar findings have been encountered 
at Minnesota, a program with a good 
reputation and a respected coach in Clem 
Haskins, these problems have to be taken 
more seriously.
The NCAAneeds to stop kiddingthem- 
selves that big-time college basketball
players are students first and athletes 
second. If it weren’t for basketball, a 
large number of the players would not 
even consider attending college. And 
now, with the recent court ruling that a 
minimum standardized 
test score can no longer 
be required to play col­
lege athletics due to the 
racial bias of these ex­
ams, there will un­
doubtedly be an influx 
of even more academi­
cally questionable ath­
letes into the ranks of 
college ball. These types 
of players would have 
trouble keeping their 
grades afloat even with­
out the burden of play­
ing big-time hoops. 
Travel and late start­
ing times due to the in­
creasing influence of 
ESPN cause players to 
miss countless classes, 
and academics must 
seem inconsequential 
when thousands of fans 
live and die with their 
every move on the 
Hl33 CoIkfSl03lu y03 M3l22 court, not to mention
the fact that many athletic departments 
count on the teams to bring in millions of 
dollars of revenue.
I suggest that we stop the illusion of 
viewing these athletes as normal stu­
dents. It’s true that the vast majority of 
them are not going to make the NBA, 
but just experiencing four years of col­
lege in which they are allowed to mature 
and learn about the world and them­
selves definitely is more beneficial than 
not going to school at all. I’m not saying 
that athletes no longer need to take 
classes, just that we allow them to take 
something they enjoy and would benefit 
from. Let them major in basketball. Ac­
tors are allowed to major in drama, and 
not all of them are going to make it to 
Broadway. So let basketball players 
major in basketball, with concentra­
tions in coaching, management, com­
mentary, or any other aspect of the game. 
Make the season a type of co-op period 
where they get credit for being on the 
team and don’t have to take a normal 
load of classes. If they don’t make a 
professional league, they .will then be 
able to work in some capacity for the 
game that allowed them to get a free 
education. I know this would destroy 
part of the image that we hold of our 
college athletes and that much more 
would need to be done to totally fix the 
problem. However, I would rather this 
be the situation than continuing to pre­
tend that the athletes are normal stu­
dents while their eligibility requires 
underhanded dealings which, when ex­
posed, only hurt the player, his pro­
gram, and the sport as a whole.
Pete Patterson is a sophomore IDS 
major who thinks March is the greatest 
time of year, despite the fact that the 
weather sucks and everyone’s stuck here 
at school. If CMU were to ever offer a 
major in sports, he’d be one of the first to 
sign up.

Which frat boy got lucky and shagged 
Katie Holmes? What did Phantom of the 
Opera have to do with Darth Vader? How 
much has the story of Pinocchio changed 
over the years? Why does Dick Tracy get to 
be tied up by a beautiful woman? Who stole 
all the beer from the fraternity quad?
These questions were all answered Sat­
urday during the 1999 Greek Sing held at 
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. Six­
teen Greek houses gathered and performed 
to help raise money for the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation of Western Pennsylvania.
For six hours last Saturday, the sorori­
ties and fraternities of CMU showed off 
their diverse talents. Each house put on a 
musical production complete with singing, 
dancing, and acting. Judges were invited to 
select the best musical production. While 
each production was spectacular, at the 
end of the evening, Guys ’n 'Dolls, per­
formed by Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta 
Tau Delta, took home the prize in the 
mixed category. In the single-house pro­
duction category, Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) 
brought home the trophy with their Rag­
time number.
The show started off with the jazz 
singers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, who apol­
ogized in advance for their utter lack of 
rhythm. They proceeded to sing and stomp 
their way through five Neil Diamond songs 
including “America,” “Love on the Rocks,” 
and “Hello Again.”
The only sorority to perform in the single 
house category was Kappa Kappa Gamma. 
Their show paid tribute to one of the 
flashiest stars in modem music, Madonna. 
The girls of Kappa, clad in black spandex, 
danced to the beat of “Vogue,” “Material 
Girl,” and other hits of the diva.
hard on this production,” said Dan 
Shapiro, a sophomore in social and deci­
sion sciences, after his fraternity’s Ragtime 
skit. Also featured in the Ragtime produc­
tion were Michael Greaves, a senior elec­
trical and computer engineering major,
And when the moment came you just have 
that gut feeling,” said Joe Haughton, a 
first-year music major. Haughton was one 
of the soloists who performed in Guys V 
Dolls. He sang “Fugue for Three-Ten 
Horns” along with Christopher Boggs, a
PiKA presented a Star Wars skit on Saturday
who played Coalhouse Walker, and Abram 
Shapiro, a senior computer science major, 
who played Henry Ford. AEPi also sup­
plied their own ragtime band.
“I knew these kids were talented, but I 
didn’t know we had this many talents,” 
said Amy Kennedy, associate professor of 
biological sciences. “I think it’s a good rep­
resentation of the positive aspects of 
Greek life.”
Kennedy was one of the judges who 
scored each production based on vocals, 
chorales, music, and production.
The other judges were Lynn Stewart, 
who is a locally recognized instructor at
T9L.u SlI2kluufSl03lu Vq939 M3l22 
The film Dick Tracy was the inspiration for DG and DU’s musical number.
The highlight in the single house divi­
sion was the performance given by the 
brothers of AEPi. In this production, AEPi 
returned to the ragtime era and re-exam­
ined how turn-of-the-century New York 
was the scene in which Americans and 
immigrants alike fought and died to 
achieve the “American Dream.”

thought was needed. It took up till the last

The selection from Guy’s V Dolls also 
included “Take Back Your Mink,” sung by 
Meigan Stack, a first-year music major. 
The chorus line which performed this num­
ber proceeded to take off their dresses off 
on stage, leaving only their silk slips, as 
they swung and kicked their way into the 
audience’s hearts.
“This year’s mixed competition is a lot 
fiercer. The performers have learned to use 
the stage space better,” said Jonathan 
Hsieh, a junior electrical and computer 
engineering major.
The evening’s comic relief came from 
Kappa Sigma with their Scooby Doo skit. 
The topics of sex, drugs, and rock and roll 
were all covered. At one point, they called 
(using a fake telephone) all the houses on 
the fraternity quad to find out who had 
beer, only to discover that it had all been 
stolen. The beer thief turned out to be 
Michael Douglas, the star of Wonder Boys.
“We chose Make-A-Wish foundation this 
year because we’ve worked with them in 
the past. We think it’s a good cause. Make- 
A-Wish really appreciates our help, and 
they show [their gratification],” said 
Rebecca Weaver, a fifth-year senior busi­
ness administration major.
This year’s Philanthropic Award was 
won by Zeta Psi Sigma for raising the most 
money for this cause.“It’s the best award to 
win, really,” said Ligeia Richardson, a 
sophomore music major. “I mean, this is 
the original reason for Greek Sing. It’s not 
to compete to see who wins; it’s to raise 
money for those in need. I think Greek 
Sing is an excellent event in that it not 
only is fun for those who participate, but 
also those that attend.”
Other houses that placed included Delta 
Upsilon, Theta Xi, Pi Kappa Alpha, Delta 
Gamma, Delta Delta Delta, and Phi 
Kappa Theta.

Stephen Jay Stadelmeier is an associ­
ate professor in the School of Design. He 
teaches industrial design courses deal­
ing with how people interact with tech­
nology. Like many design professors, 
Stadelmeier also works on outside pro­
jects in the Pittsburgh community. 
Besides teaching, Stadelmeier also 
designs wheelchairs at the University of 
Pittsburgh, working with the Rehabili­
tation Engineering Research Center 
(RERC). RERC is part of the School of 
Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at 
the University of Pittsburgh.
The Tartan: Are you working on a 
project now?
Stephan Stadelmeier: The project 
that they were not quite able to cope 
with was this one, which is the design 
of a wheelchair for indoor use. One of 
the difficulties is that most of those 
chairs have a clinical statement to 
them, and the design of this chair was 
to try to remove that clinical state­
ment. This stuff isn’t handled in any 
way, shape, or form like consumer 
products. There are no issues of desir­
ability; those just aren’t things that are 
discussed in this realm.
TT: What kind of problems did you 
find in previous wheelchair designs?
SS: If you’re in one of these institu­
tions ... this is a person who lived a 
normal life, and then they suddenly 
sign over their wealth to one of these 
places. They come in saddened by the 
experience, because they’ve given up 
their control to someone else, and so
they start to lose physical strength. 
Then the staff will stick these people in 
a wheelchair. You ever sat in a wheel­
chair, one of those regular ones? It’ll 
cause your respiration rate to go down. 
It’ll cause all sorts of back problems. 
Eventually, in addition to becoming 
more and more depressed about sitting 
in one of these things, you will get clin­
ically worse for having sat in this thing. 
Part of it has to do with the hardware 
that you’re working with isn’t stuff that 
encourages social interaction. It isn’t 
stuff that encourages your own self- 
image. [When they eat,] they’re in a 
wheelchair, and the wheelchair can’t 
get close to the table. So they try to feed 
themselves, and food spills, they feel 
like jerks. It’s just this totally debilitat­
ing experience.
So, given all that, the intention 
behind [this project] was to make it so 
that it didn’t look particularly like a 
wheelchair. This chair can go up and 
down just like an office chair. It can 
also tilt, and the arms can go out of the 
way. What that means is that you can 
interact with normal furniture, not just 
special handicap-access furniture. You 
can take it up high if you want to work 
at a kitchen counter. You can bring it 
down and tilt it forward, so that it’ll 
help you stand up. You can also knock 
it apart by pulling a couple of pins out 
and stick it in the trunk of a car.
TT: What were some things you had 
to consider that most people wouldn’t 
think you’d have to consider?
SS: There’s a wide range of people in 
terms of their physical sizes and physi­
cal capabilities. How do you accommo­
date them? In the disabled area, you
Stadelmeier’s recent work includes a better-designed wheelchair.
have to maintain an incredibly 
wide inventory and adjustability for all 
these people. So it keeps the products 
looking pretty ugly, pretty clinical, 
more like hospital beds than your 
own bed.
There’s a lot of difficulty with the 
anthropometric range that you have to 
cope with, and the disability. When 
you’re dealing with a power chair, will 
this person have the cognitive or phys­
ical ability to control it? Can you imag­
ine a person with Parkinson’s disease 
trying to play a Nintendo game? Okay, 
now they’re not just playing Crash 
Bandicoot, they are Crash Bandicoot, 
and their goal is to get down the hall­
way with this 300-pound thing.
I spent years teaching in the area of 
human factors. The whole area is how 
do you make responsible decisions, 
when you make a physical artifact 
knowing full well that some people 
won’t be able to use it. How do you bal­
ance all those things? That’s what 
makes it interesting, too, because 
you know that it helps people. I think 
about design as making background 
objects for other people’s lives, thp 
objects that will make their lives possi­
ble. You’re able to do the things in your 
life that you really wanted to do. .1 
guess I have a lot of respect for other 
people’s ability to work that way, 
to deliver better stuff to more people. 
I think that’s a noble thing.

Poets Marc Sheehan and Rane 
Arroyo shared their work at the March 
10 reading, held in the McKenna room 
of the University Center as part of the 
Adamson Visiting Writer’s Series.
Sheehan and Arroyo created a friend­
ly informal atmosphere by mingling 
with students before the actual reading 
began. Jim Daniels, professor of 
English at CMU, introduced the poets, 
saying he felt that neither poet
had received the attention that 
each deserved.
Sheehan, who has been published in 
journals such as the Pennsylvania 
Review and the New York Review, read 
pieces from his 1998 book, Greatest 
Hits, as well as new unpublished work. 
Unlike many practicing writers, Shee­
han does not work at or teach in a uni­
versity. Rather, he has drawn upon his 
experiences in the working world to 
create his pieces.
The first poem he read was an 
account of buying wine as a bookkeep-
Marc Sheehan reads from his book at last week’s Writers Series lecture.
er, while another poem dealt with sit­
ting at his desk at the American 
Red Cross, pondering both the 
work of French poet Arthur Rimbaud 
and the cover of Patti Smith’s latest 
CD. A love poem expressed emotion 
through references to typesetting and 
classic-car restoration.
Other samplings of Sheehan’s work 
centered around his life as a resident of 
the Midwest, and a series of verses 
entitled “Liner Notes” told the story 
of a fictitious musician, dreaming of 
the perfect musical instrument and 
singing on-stage.
In addition to poems, Sheehan deliv­
ered what he called “micro-short sto­
ries,” which were titled “First Mar­
riage” and “Second Marriage.” “First 
Marriage” told the story of the short­
lived matrimony of two college stu­
dents who studied Shakespeare and 
smoked marijuana on a futon covered 
in Indian fabric. “Second Marriage” 
described a wedding that took place in 
a living room, the newlyweds rejoicing 
over fifths of whiskey, their baby-sitter, 
and the fact that the groom was handy 
around the house.
Immediately following Sheehan’s 
reading was that of Rane Arroyo, who 
is an associate professor of creative 
writing in Toledo, Ohio. Arroyo was 
born in Puerto Rico and educated at the 
University of Pittsburgh. Arroyo’s 
poems are set in a variety of locations. 
His animated style of reading was
described by Daniels as being “like a 
favorite radio station.”
Arroyo offered selections • from his 
books Pale Ramon, which focuses on 
women, and Invitation to Russia, his 
latest. His readings of “Silly Dances” 
and “The Exiles” both painted a picture 
of growing up as a young Puerto Rican 
in the United States. A poem from Pale 
Ramon paid tribute to the women he 
has known throughout his life.
Another, written about Emily Dickin­
son, compared and contrasted Dickin­
son’s quiet life in Amherst, Massachu­
setts with Arroyo’s turbulent childhood 
years, growing up in a Solent neigh­
borhood. Arroyo said that he felt a con­
nection to Dickinson upon first encoun­
tering her work, because he was not 
allowed to go outside when his family 
first migrated from Puerto Rico.
Claiming the letter “h” is nothing 
more than the letters “1” and“n” mat­
ing, and calling Virgil a “one-man 
ambulance,” Arroyo delighted his audi­
ence with his wit and insight. He inter­
rupted himself partway through a 
poem about the Holocaust to say, “You 
know what’s sad about fraternities? 
They like ‘Piano Man.’ ”
“It’s weird being a published poet,” 
said Arroyo, after the reading. “You 
write poems alone, in the dark, then, 
suddenly, they’ve all been put in a book, 
and you’re out in public reading them 
to an audience. You wonder how 
it all happened.”

The Geek Beat
by Ellen Beldner
-The human brain is an impressive 
piece of machinery. Considering that it 
evolved out of millions of years of state- 
of-the-art, trial-and-error technology, 
tiie fact that humans can read 
books, play the violin, and build com­
puters is amazing.
Even better, though — our wetware 
keeps plugging away and is busily 
scheming up new ways to improve 
ifeelf. And no, we’re not talking about 
ah SAT prep course.
Scientists, such as the United King­
dom’s Kevin Warwick, are busily figur­
ing out how we can become one with 
our computers — building chips and
circuitry that we can stuff under our 
skin and power with our built-in elec­
trical system.
Warwick, who last August became 
the first human being to host a 
microchip, underwent a 20-minute sur­
gical procedure to have a glass capsule 
filled with several microprocessors 
inserted into his arm.
Although Warwick’s' chip is self-pow­
ered, it was still a bona fide step 
towards the cyborg: Warwick research­
es intelligent houses, and in his 
laboratories at the University of Read­
ing, wired doorways now greet 
him as he walks through. More practi­
cally, Warwick no longer uses his 
smartcard to enter and exit areas that 
required ID.
In the near future — i.e., within our 
lifetimes — biotech will probably reach 
the point where we can get these 
implants for all sorts of things. For 
example, scientists suggest that per­
sonal computers can be rigged to 
respond to people’s implants: You wave
your finger, your chip implant commu­
nicates with your PC, and the mouse 
moves. Even better, think of the gam­
ing applications, less in shoot-’em-up 
adventures like Quake and more in 
exploration games like Riven or mar­
tial arts games.
Who knows how quickly things will 
progress, but the next step is wiring 
the central nervous system to a chip. 
The big selling point for the majority of 
the population would probably be that 
such an advance would permit perfect­
ly safe VR sex, but let’s indulge in a lit­
tle sci-fi fantasy here: Suppose we 
could store data on a chip and access it 
with our brains. We could toss out our 
Softbooks and just plug in a War and 
Peace chipset, instantly having access 
to Tolstoy’s theory of history and his 
description of the Battle of Borodino.
Such a step, however, is a big one, 
and it’s an issue that society is going to 
insist on grappling with before chip 
implants can become widespread. Cer­
tainly, if someone can plug a library of
information into their brain, much like 
Molly in William Gibson’s Neuro- 
jnancer, it’s going to give those people 
an insurmountable advantage over 
those who have to learn their 19th- 
century Chinese history the old-fash­
ioned way.
At the very least, it’s frightening to 
think you will probably become sub­
servient to cyborgs; at the most, 
those who don’t want chips will howl 
and cry that it’s an unfair advantage, 
and will try to prevent others from get­
ting them.
For example, a CNN Online poll lists 
that 53 percent of about 10,000 respon­
dents claim they would not even con­
sider having microchips implanted in 
their bodies.
This isn’t a scientific survey, but if 
Gallup were to run a poll, it’s pretty 
likely that the general population 
would be even more likely to respond 
negatively: People reading about
biochips on the net are probably, on 
average, more receptive to new tech­
nologies than your typical American. 
Turning humans into cyborgs is a more 
delicate issue than investing robots 
with artificial intelligence: With
implants, we are not investing 
machines with a human capacity — we 
are, some would say, dehumanizing 
ourselves by bonding with machines.
But why try to create humanlike 
machines? Why give them our 
marvelous capacity for language 
(which is one of the great dividing 
lines between man and machine, 
as any Turing test will tell you) without 
including our flaws of irrationality?
We can seize the brass ring ourselves. 
Chip implants might conceivably allow 
us to overcome our brains’ biggest 
weakness — forgetfulness. Harnessing 
machines’ incredible power of near-per­
fect data storage is surely provocative 
enough to inspire the attempt.

If you were to see Michael 
Moore on the street, you might 
think he was just a normal guy. 
That’s also the impression you 
gfct if you saw Moore in front of 
a' jam-packed audience in 
ftfrcConomy last Thursday.
^The AB lecture series brought 
Moore to CMU, where, in 
rare fashion, students were 
Heard speaking about several 
political issues amid frequent 
bursts of laughter.
‘ “[Moore] was amazing. He 
was speaking the gospel,” said 
Paul Riley, a doctoral student 
ih biological sciences, after the 
Moore’s talk.
The substance of the lecture 
was that strange breed of politi­
cal humor and satire that has 
made Moore nationally known 
as one of the most-feared film­
makers in America. His highly 
acclaimed 1989 documentary 
film Roger and Me detailed the 
^.ass downsizing by GM of 
workers in Moore’s native 
Flint, Michigan. Since then, 
Moore has become famous as 
one who is willing challenge cor­
porate America face-to-face.
In the film, Moore interviews 
those who have been fired, and 
attempts to meet one-on-one 
with the head of GM, Roger 
Smith, in order to invite him 
oyer to Flint and talk about the 
situation over a couple of beers. 
After Roger and Me, Moore 
went on to direct another movie, 
Write two books, and create a TV 
show entitled TV Nation in
which he harasses corporate 
and political America with his 
pushy attitude.
Moore’s down-to-earth style 
made him an immediate crowd 
favorite. Full of humor, he was 
not afraid to show off his serious 
side, either. Moore said that 
before Roger and Me, he had no 
filmmaking experience, and had 
not even attended college.
Throughout his lecture, Moore 
emphasized the need for every­
one to speak out for what they 
believe, and to not feel apathetic 
toward political issues. “I’m not 
a political activist — I’m a citi­
zen,” he said.
Moore voiced his opinion 
about the impeachment trial 
and the Lewinsky affair that 
has taken Washington and 
the national media by storm. 
Mostly, Moore showed his 
extreme delight at what he 
referred to as the “death of the 
Republican Party.”
“I’ve never been so happy as 
this. ... The Senate was occu­
pied for a year so [the Republi­
cans] didn’t pass any laws to 
screw the rest of us,” he said.
According to Moore, by 
attempting to stage a coup d’etat 
of an elected President, the 
Republicans were losing ground. 
He referred to them as “Shiite 
Republicans,” likening them to a 
highly conservative Muslim 
tribe, conducting a “jihad”, 
or holy war.
Moore clearly stated he was 
not a Democrat, though, and 
had not voted for Bill Clinton. 
He said he felt that the Republi­
cans and the Democrats did not
offer any substantial differ­
ences, and so one of the parties 
has to go.
The low voter turnout in the 
last presidential election was 
also a concern, said Moore. He 
said he believed this occurred 
not because people were igno­
rant or apathetic towards poli­
tics, but because there was a 
lack of good candidates.
“The people in this country 
aren’t as stupid as the press 
makes them out to be,” said 
Moore. “It’s between Tweedle­
dum and Tweedle-dumber.”
Moore stated the necessity to 
have a party which, unlike the 
Republicans or Democrats, rep­
resents the working class 
of America. The death of the 
Republican party is one step 
forward towards this goal. 
“I’d like people to go in and sign 
up for local democratic offices,” 
he added.
“I think some of the best parts 
were when he toned down the 
humor and focused on more seri­
ous theoretical comments,” said 
Joe Valeri, a junior creative 
writing major.
Besides political issues, Moore 
touched on other topics includ­
ing corporate downsizing, and 
the inferiority of men to women. 
He also showed a never-before- 
seen clip from his new TV show, 
The Awful Truth which will air 
April 11 on the Bravo Network. 
Based on the same premise as 
TV Nation, The Awful Truth 
nevertheless allowed Moore 
more freedom than the old show, 
which was aired on Fox and 
heavily censored. Among other

things the clip showed Moore 
attempting to bring Bill Gates 
several housewarming gifts at 
Microsoft’s Washington state 
headquarters such as a Dirt 
Devil and Mr. Coffee for Gates’s 
new $60-million home.
Afterwards, Moore answered 
several questions from the. audi­
ence. He tackled each question 
seriously, and at times with 
humor. Most participants would
agree that Moore is extremely 
competent and very concerned 
when speaking about important 
issues facing the country.
Near the end of his lecture 
after a ‘lightning round’ style 
question and answer session, a 
student asked Moore, “Are you 
optimistic about this country’s 
future?” Moore replied to the 
student, “If you get off your 
ass, I am!”

The purpose Gay Jeans Day is to increase awareness of sexual minority issues at 
Carnegie Mellon, and to promote diversity and understanding in our community.
Why should I wear jeans on March 16? By wearing jeans you will be sending a signal 
to students, faculty and staff - that our campus is a place where people can freely be 
who they are, regardless of their sexual orientation.
What if I can't wear jeans? Simple. Accessorize! Pin a denim ribbon on your clothes 
or backpack. We will be handing out denim ribbons at our table by the fence.
Where can I get more information about Gay Jeans Day? See our Web page at

Artist examines politics through paintings
Former students blend music with technology
Last week’s Wats:on? Festival marked the third year of commemorating former architect and 
Carnegie Mellon alumna] ill W atson. N amed one of the American Institute of Architect’s four 
outstanding woman architects in 1990, Jill Watson had a brief yet impressive.architectural 
career. During her short time as an architect, Watson received numerous awards for her work, 
including the Penn Avenue at Graham Street restoration project, located in the Garfield 
section of Pittsburgh. Watson was also involved in designing projects for Arthur Lubetz 
Associates, including the design of the Allegheny Valley YMCA, the Top Notch Art Store in 
Oakland, and the Judy Penzler House in Shadyside.
In addition to her numerous professional accomplishments, Watson also served as an adjunct 
faculty member at CMU, where she was a master of fine arts candidate.
In honor of the life of this established young architect, Carnegie Mellon held a two-day 
festival last week to celebrate many of Watson’s manifold artistic interests. The festival, which 
was sponsored by Watson’s family, was intended to bring members of the community together 
to interact with the College of Fine Arts and bring to light many of the diverse artistic elements 
which helped shape Watson’s life.

Tartan Diversions Editor
“Everybody [in the art world] is fight­
ing over scraps, and we don’t know how 
big [our scraps] are until we are done 
fighting,” said the internationally re­
nowned artist Leon Golub, when he met 
with students last Thursday during the 
Watsron? Festival.
Fitting with his statement, Golub’s 
work is raw, aggressive, and usually 
focused on human violence. Unlike the 
“scraps,” his paintings are not ambigu­
ous. The circumstances are clear, 
and the images, which typically derive 
from photographs, are straightforward 
and shocking.
During a slide lecture, which followed 
the discussion that he had, Golub spoke 
about his experience with the art world, 
his own work, the installation work of 
his wife, Nancy Spero, and his often 
controversial subject matter.
“Politics, religion, and sex — that’s 
where you get into trouble. That’s where 
people get agitated,” he said. Neverthe­
less, Golub’s paintings usually deal di­
rectly with political and social issues. 
After painting the less figurative Space­
man and Colossal Heads in the ’50s, his
work began to reflect current events. 
Vietnam was a turning point for him.
“When [Nancy and I] returned to the 
U.S. from France [in the late ’60s], we 
became more aware of the war. I joined 
a group of artist protesters against Viet­
nam,” he said.
It was during that time that Golub 
began painting Vietnam War-related 
subjects, and even though his themes 
have changed with time, he still paints 
in the same brutal, figurative style that 
he did when he painted the soldiers in 
his 1974 work, Vietnam 3, which he 
showed during his lecture.
“I still have that habit of forcing for­
ward,” he said. The viewer cannot help 
but feel intimidated by his figures, which 
are generally one and a half times their 
actual size and usually stand against a 
solid-colored background. One becomes 
witness to the life-threatening situa­
tions that Golub draws.
The paintings that he produced in the 
’70s and ’80s were almost always either 
portraits of political figures or men and 
women in the middle of a violent act. 
One of his most famous series of paint­
ings is the Mercenary series. “Mercenar­
ies are guns for hire — usually older 
than average soldiers,” he said. Another
is his Interrogation series. Interrogation 
III, which was done in 1981, was one of 
the paintings that he showed during the 
slide lecture that followed the discus­
sion. The painting is a prime example of 
his style and is also characteristic of the 
brutal themes which he has chosen to 
depict for over 30 years.
In Interrogation III, two large men are 
shown physically abusing a shackled 
naked woman. The painting is difficult 
to look at because of the sense of imme­
diacy that it evokes. However, one be­
comes interested in the action and curi­
ous about the psyches of those depicted.
Almost as intriguing as Golub’s unset­
tling subject matter is his process and 
technique. For the most part, Golub’s 
routine has remained the same over the 
years. He begins each painting by select­
ing photographs from his large cata­
loged collection in his studio. He com­
bines photos of figures, guns, and other 
objects in order to create his own compo­
sition before he begins painting.
After he decides on the layout of the 
piece, he paints between four and five 
coats of acrylic paint on top of each other 
and covers the detail with the final coat. 
After the paint has dried, he uses a 
sharp tool along with solvents to scrape
off the top coats and reveal 
sections of detail. “[The final 
product] is always a sur­
prise,” he said. As a result of 
the scratching and scraping, 
the uneven surfaces enhance 
the roughness of the figures 
and their situations.
More than 50 years after 
graduating from the Art In­
stitute of Chicago, Golub con­
tinues to paint in the same 
style that he says was origi­
nally influenced by primi­
tive art, Greek art, Oceanic 
art, the Abstract Expression­
ists, and Pablo Picasso.
However, his subject mat­
ter has grown with him. 
“I’m not doing as much po­
litical work. I’m trying to 
be more ambiguous,” he said. 
Nevertheless, his “forced for­
ward” paintings continue to 
be cynical and direct.
In one of Golub’s recent 
paintings, a tattooed moun­
tain lion is shown lying on 
the ground; she holds up 
a sign that reads, “Getting 
old sucks.”

Leave it to Carnegie Mellon 
alumni to create a band whose
only instruments are three 
Macintosh PowerBooks. Made up 
of three former Carnegie Mellon 
students, Operation Re-Informa- 
tion, also known as ORI, com­
bines the talents of a computer 
science major and two fine arts
uiuuciu luonia/ lauaii rvoui ig i nuiu w.bw.b
Dr. Spanglestein and his band Operation Re-Information entertained 
students during the Wats:on? festival
majors to create a unique sound 
generated solely by computers.
As a part ofthis week’s Wats:on? 
Festival, Dr. Spectt, Dr. 
Spanglestein, and Dr. Triplex, the 
“audio presentation team” of 
ORI performed original pieces 
with PowerBooks and 
strapped-on keyboards as their 
only instruments.
A band of considerable re­
pute, ORI has played at 
Carnegie Mellon in the past. 
This time around, their set was 
less exhibitional and played 
with less audience interaction, 
yet the program was far more 
experimental. The show con­
sisted of dynamic remixes of 
some of their most popular 
songs.
With two albums under their 
belt, CTRL and Universal 
Standard84000, ORI has been 
featured in such popular pub­
lications as Wired and Spin 
magazine.
ORI’s unique construction 
seemed to fit perfectly with 
the transdiciplinary theme of 
the Watsion? Festival. Chris­
tian Schwartz, senior commu­
nication design major and 
designer of the Wats:on? 
Festival’s advertisements rec­
ommended Operation Re-In­
formation to the festival 
commitee. “ORI bridges together 
music, computer science, and per­
formance art. The visual presen­
tation is just as important as the 
audio,” said Schwartz.
The technology behind ORI is 
the basis for their artistic expres­
sion. The underlying structure of 
their music is rooted in 
BackToBasics, a computer pro­
gram which they developed them­
selves a few years ago.
Dr. Spectt of ORI describes the 
program in its most basic terms. 
“BackToBasics allows you to trig­
ger digital audio samples stored 
on your computer via your key­
board,” said Spectt.
The prorgram’s simplicity and 
flexibility has prompted its 
popularity among such 
bands as Man...or 
Astroman? and Duran 
Duran, who have each 
used the BackToBasics 
program in their music.
Thursday’s perfor­
mance was well received
by the audience, although some 
missed the theatrics of their past 
performances. “ORI played a re­
ally great show,” said Matt 
Tragesser, senior Communica­
tion esign major. “But I think 
people were expecting something 
similar to last semester’s show 
where the band was a little more 
animated,” Tragesser said.
Indeed, with their quirky mu­
sical samples and computer- 
dominated perfor­
mances, Operation 
Re-Information 
is the ulti- 
m a t e
Mellon band. ORI gives hope to 
all students trapped in “informa- 
tion-controlled majors” that if you 
can’t get a job with Microsoft, you 
can always revolutionize the 
music world.

Friday night, the Sno-Core tour came 
to -play at a nearly-packed warehouse 
full1 of musically starved Pittsburgh 
teenagers. The four-act performance 
had .'its moments, but on the whole it 
could have provided more musical en­
tertainment.
The Crane center, a new venue lo­
cated a few blocks off the Strip District, 
provided a pretty good place to house 
the bands and the audience. The con­
cert kicked off with DJ Spooky. It was 
apparent that “That Subliminal Kid” 
had skills with “two turntables and a 
microphone.” His unique technique and 
creativity, however, were lost on the 
mostly high-school crowd. Probably 
many of the failings in the concert can 
be attributed the lack of enthusiasm for 
the.iopeningacts. In addition, the sound 
setup wasn’t as good as it could have 
been — music often coagulated into 
pure scratchy stuff.
Xfter DJ Spooky’s short set came the 
surprise of the concert, arguably the 
best act. The Black Eyed Peas, a group 
of v^ry talented musicians, can be de­
scribed as a mix between Cypress Hill 
and .the Fugees. Three amazing rap­
per^, were supplemented by a Lauryn 
HilJrlike woman, a drummer, bassist, 
guitarist, and keyboard player. They 
worked the crowd well, and got things 
moving at a decently frenetic level. Their 
excellent lyrics and beat were supple­
mented by amazing dance moves and 
funny antics.
Tiie crowd then seemed to be worked 
up and ready for the New York funky
jazz-rock band known as Soul Cough­
ing. The super-original and incredibly 
talented band played a relatively short 
set, which was a little disappointing. 
Most of the songs came from their 
latest album, El Oso. They opened 
with “Circles,” and continued on with 
“Rolling,” “$300,” and “St. Louise is 
Listening.” The set ended with a fan 
favorite, “Super Bon Bon.” Unfortu­
nately, the crowd downplayed the 
music, they failed to move, ruined the 
atmosphere and probably did not help 
the band’s energy. Perhaps if the teen­
age crowd hadn’t been so intent upon 
seeing the final act, Everclear, they 
would have been able to appreciate 
the sheer quality of Soul Coughing’s 
music.
Everclear’s performance was easily 
the most forgettable act in the whole 
show. The band catered to what the 
angry kids wanted—loud music. This, 
unfortunately, was at the expense of 
providing anything of quality. The 
sound system seemed to aid the poor­
ness of the act, even Everclear’s “Fa­
ther of Mine” sounded like something 
you would expect to hear at a KMFDM 
concert.
At the end of the show, when the 
crowd-surfing and pathetic attempts 
at moshing had ended, perhaps if you 
were a 13 year old that had been ac­
companied by your parents, you would 
have thought this concert was really 
cool. However, Soul Coughing’s short 
set, Everclear’s uninspiring perfor­
mances, and most importantly, the 
crowd’s lack of enthusiasm during key 
moments, made this concert fairly lack­
luster.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be

ering that her comic timing and range of 
acting were so impressively exhibited in 
last year’s The Opposite of Sex. In addir

Well, “deep” is a strong 
word.
DeNiro plays Paul Vitti, 
a New York mafia don 
who’s “got stress.” He can’t 
perform in bed with his 
mistress; he can’t summon 
the nerve to kill anyone; 
and he’s starting to have

he thinks anyone who uses 
the term “panic attacks” 
must be questioning his 
virility. Lucky for Vitti,

a shrink, enters the pic­

rear-ends a car with a body 
in the trunk. Vitti is reluc­
tant at first to admit that 
he is in need of help and insists that his 
“friend” has problems. Sobel sees through 
the silly facade, however, which im­
presses Vitti (“You’re goodl”), and they

Peter Tolan and Ken Lonergan. Each 
such scene is a delightful interplay be­
tween Sobel’s whining over his predica­
ment and Vitti’s macho airs; while, at
same goes for the character 
of Sobel’s son: From the way 
their conversations are 
written, you would think 
they had just met. Joe 
Viterelli, who plays movie 
gangsters for a living, does 
his routine schtick as Vitti’6

Palminteri’s character is 
just a plot device.

was put to much better use 
in Woody Allen’s mobster 
comedy Bullets Over Broad­

thug discovering his true

In theater, the audience’s at­
tention should be focused on the 
actors, the actresses, and the ac­
tual story. However, the techni­
cal aspects such as sets, lighting, 
costume, and sound play an equal 
role in each show’s success. What 
we see on stage is often beautiful, 
sometimes breathtaking. But 
what many people do not realize 
is that what the audience sees on 
stage only comes after a long pro­
cess of designing and production.
The current exhibit at the 
Hewlett Gallery, Form and Func-

Cast the First Stone
Nitro Records
Last Tuesday Ensign, New Jersey king­
pins of old-school and late ’80s hardcore, 
came out with a new album entitled Cast the 
First Stone. Much to fans’ surprise, the new 
album was released on a different record 
label, Nitro Records. Located in Huntington 
Beach, Nitro has such punk bands as 
Guttermouth, The Vandals, and Jughead’s 
Revenge its roster.
Cast the First Stone contains 16 tracks, 
and includes two songs re-recorded from 
previous Ensign albums. The music and 
vocals on their fourth release are angrier, 
darker, tougher, and less catchy than their 
previous full-length LP. Ensign is known for 
their energy and and quick-tempo, danceable 
songs.
Songs on Cast the First Stone contemplate 
individuality, wasting time, and ending the 
slaughter of animals. Even though these 
themes have been covered by other hardcore 
bands, Ensign uses their successful writing 
skills. This album, however, does not top
their superior, energetic previous effort, The 
Direction of Things to Come. In comparison 
to Direction, the new album sounds diminu­
tively more groove-oriented and more ag­
gressive.
Even though Direction may have been a 
better album, Cast the First Stone is still 
worth a listen. Don’t believe what the media 
has said about rock being dead. This is 
positive, youthful music for desperate times.

Johnny Vegas
Forest Hill Drive 
Leprechaun Records
Johnny Vegas, the Syracuse pop-rock group, 
has attempted to build success the way doz­
ens of bands have before them — by them­
selves. Through constant touring and word of 
mouth, Johnny Vegas has been fairly suc­
cessful so far and has sold over 13,000 copies 
of their first two albums.
The group’s musical style on their third 
album, Forest Hill Drive, is fairly simple. The 
album features straightforward pop-rock 
songs driven by ’60s style fuzz-distorted gui­
tars, and ’90s wuss-rock style vocals along
the lines of Guster and Hootie and the Blow- 
fish. Occasionally Johnny Vegas tosses in pi­
anos and acoustic guitars, but for the mosfcpart 
this is electric-guitar-driven music.
As in most pop music, the songs on--this 
album are filled with guitar hooks, which makes 
them catchy. However, in this case, the hooks 
are repetitive and uninteresting. The guitar 
riffs in many of the songs, especially in Over­
drive and Temper, sound like they came from 
various Tom Petty songs. The vocal opening of 
Grandma’s Silverware sounds like the Grate­
ful Dead. These similarities in sound are prob­
ably unintentional, but they are irritating.just 
the same. V,
Occasionally there are songs on the album 
like “Brakeshoe” and “Should’ve Slept In” in 
which the instrumental part of the music does 
not make you want to drive your head into a 
wall. However, the lead vocals of Keith Calveric 
do. He sings at basically the same speed, with 
the same inflections, for basically the whole 
album. -~
Johnny Vegas supposedly has a reputation for 
energetic live shows, and often that type of music 
doesn’t translate well onto recordings. But nev- 
ertheless this record is very hard to listen to.

Pianist Vladimir Feltsman, accompanied 
by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, 
delivered a breathtaking performance of 
the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 at 
last Friday’s sold-out concert in Heinz Hall. 
Both the orchestra, under the direction of 
guest conductor Thomas Sanderling, and 
Feltsman met the immense musical and 
technical demands of this work with com­
mensurate energy and grace.
Feltsman, whose most recent prior ap­
pearance with the PSO was in 1996, is an 
acclaimed Russian-born concert pianist. 
After his failed emigration attempt in 1967, 
Soviet officials banned Feltsman from pub­
lic appearances in the USSR. But in 1987, 
then-President Ronald Reagan stepped in 
and assisted Feltsman with his immigra­
tion to the U.S. Since that time, Feltsman 
has appeared with most U.S. symphony 
orchestras, performing a repertoire that 
ranges from Baroque to 20t- century mu­
sic.
Rachmaninoff s third concerto undoubt­
edly ranks high among the most challeng­
ing pieces in the piano concerto repertoire. 
Feltsman was not fazed, however, by the 
technical demands of the work. From the 
opening bars of the piece, he played with 
great clarity and careful articulation. In 
the first movement, the cadenza was beau­
tifully executed; far from seeming mechani­
cal and rehearsed, it was performed with a 
spontaneity and musical creativity that is often 
difficult to achieve in passages with such chal­
lenging fingerwork.
Though the orchestra and soloist did not play
Mlk bourfSl03lu y03 M3l22
together consistently in the first movement, 
Sanderling followed Feltsman more closely in 
the second and third movements. The finale 
movement marked the high point of the con­
certo. Feltsman played with unusual boldness 
and energy as the work reached its climax in 
this movement. Unfortunately, there were in­
stances in the finale when the orchestra was so 
loud that Feltsman could not achieve a sound 
big enough to be heard.
Throughout the performance of the concerto,
Feltsman’s expressive playing was charac­
terized by his sensitive touch and outstand­
ing technique. His passion for the music 
was evident even in his physical move­
ments, as he frequently leapt forward from 
his chair and threw his arms up in the air 
to mark the ends of phrases. Sanderjing’s 
equally commendable direction of thé or­
chestra focused on the expressive qualities 
within the music, with careful atterition 
paid to dynamics and tone.
The concert opened with the overture tô 
Mussorgsky’s opera Khovanshchina. This 
opera was written to depict the unstable 
atmosphere in 17th-century Russia during 
Peter the Great’s ascent to power. fThê 
overture to Khovanshchina is short* but 
beautifully orchestrated. Gentle flowing 
melodies are passed between sections of 
the orchestra to create a serene, almost 
pastoral atmosphere. Quite fittingly, 
Mussorgsky described the piece as portray­
ing “Dawn on the Moscow River.”
Following the Rachmaninoff concerto, the 
evening of Russian music came to a close 
with a stirring performance of 
Shostakovich’s monumental Symphony No. 
10. Sanderling’s superb direction of the 
work was characterized by a sensitivity to 
dynamic changes and a continuous awarer 
ness of the composer’s musical intention — 
even in the most frenzied and complex of 
passages. Under Sanderling’s careful_com- 
mand, the PSO presented an excellentper- 
formance of this profound work. :

Wacky. That’s the best way to 
describe the School of Drama’s 
latest show, the Tony-winning 
musical The Mystery of Edwin 
Drood, which is directed by 
Geoffrey Hitch.
The show, a musical comedy 
that takes place in Britain at the 
end of the 19th century, is loosely 
based on an unfinished novel by 
Charles Dickens. Dickens died 
before he finished the novel, and 
so the identity of the murderer 
was never revealed. In the sec­
ond act of the show, however, the 
audience was given the opportu­
nity to vote on three mysteries 
regarding the plot, including the 
identity of the murderer. There­
fore, the murderer can vary from 
show to show.
The performance was actually 
a play within a play. The cast, 
which was made up of under­
graduates in the. School of Drama, 
played the performers ofthe Lon­
don Music Hall Royale, who in 
turn are playing the characters 
in the mystery. This gives them a 
chance to interact with the audi­
ence. Before the show, the per­
formers mingle with the audi­
ence and build the energy level 
before the show even starts.
Most of the comedy comes from
random moments, which nm from 
hilarious to outright bizarre. 
There are vicious beatings, 19th- 
century dance party numbers 
that come out of nowhere, char­
acters who change ethnicity, per­
sonality disorders, a brothel, a 
rubber chicken, and a tiny bull­
dog that appears in two scenes 
for no apparent reason.
The show is a lot of fun to watch. 
“The show makes the theater a 
place of fun: It has music, spec­
tacle, sentiment, and a mystery 
to solve,” said Hitch. There is 
much energy between the audi­
ence and the performers, arid a 
few scenes in the play that are 
completely hilarious.
The end of the show slowed 
down, probably because it runs 
two-and-a-half hours. However, 
with the quirky comedic moments 
and audience interaction, The 
Mystery of Edwin Drood proved 
to be an entertaining show.

Norouz, Persian Ne\' Vear
March 22. 1999
Norouz is the Persian New Year. The word itself means "new day" in Persian (Farsi). Norouz is 
also the first day of spring. The celebrations of Norouz symbolize two ancient concepts: the 
end and the beginning or the pure and the evil. A few days before Norouz, Persians clean 
their house, buy new clothes, and cook pastries — all to signify renewal and rebirth. Trou­
badours referred to as Haji Firuz, disguise themselves with makeup and wear brightly col­
ored outfits of satin. These Haji Firuz, singing and dancing, parade as a carnival through the 
streets with tambourines, kettle drums, and trumpets to spread good cheer and news of the 
coming new year. On the day of Norouz, everyone in the family gathers around Haft-Sinn., 
which is a ceremonial table on which seven dishes starting with the Persian letter "sinn" are 
served. The number seven has been sacred to Persians ever since ancient times. It stands for the 
seven angelic heralds of life rebirth, health, happiness, prosperity, joy, patience and beauty.
The symbolic dishes consist of:
1) Snbzeh, usually wheat or lentil sprouts, which represent rebirth. 2) Samanu, a pudding, Common wheat 
sprouts are transformed and given new life as a sweet, creamy pudding which 
exhibit the ultimate sophistication of Persian cooking.
3) Seeb, means apple and represents health and beauty. 4) Senjed, the sweet, dry 
fruit of the lotus, represents love. It has been said that when the lotus is in full 
bloom, its fragrance and its fruit make people fall in love and become oblivious to 
aU.
5) Seer, or garlic in Persian, represents medicine. 6) Sornaq, sumac berries, repre­
sent the color of sunrise; with the appearance of the sun, Good conquers Evil.
7) Serkeh, or vinegar, represents age and patience. There are other items on the 
table too, such as coins representing prosperity, painted eggs representing fertili­
ty, and goldfish representing life. A mirror represents images and reflection on 
creation, and candlesticks represent enlightenment and happiness. Another 
tradition is that after New Year has been ushered in, everyone gorges them­
selves on pastries and give the younger family members Eiadi, which is 
money-as present. The celebration continues for 13 days. On the thirteenth 
day everyone goes out and picnics and throws away their Sabzeh. This year 
Norouz is Saturday, March 20, at 20:46:29 EST. We wish you a Happy New 
Year, or "Norouzatan PeroozV
