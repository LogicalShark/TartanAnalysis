TICKETS ARE ON SALE TODAY
Again the Panther and the Plaid are to tan*, gle for the football, championship of the City òf Pittsburgh' and the-honor of, the sport. All the. color .and glory of the season's finest, foot- ball. classic in the tri-state district -will mark this, the tenth conflict between Carnegie Tech' and-the-University 0f Pittsburgh, on Saturday 
•aftemoori. *. The, brand of football displayed by the Tar*, tan team in its previous games, this year, not­withstanding itadefeut by Wàsh-Jeif on Satur­day,, merits tbe expectation of a repetition of the. memorable games of .1923 and'1924 with the.Pitt elevens,, inasmuch as'this year’s, rec­ord for the latter does not justify some of thè glowing reports of optimistic sport writers.' The ' .Camegio teanj. appears to be the strongest in years and. regardless of thé outcome'of'Satur-. day’s'gaine, there' is little doubt .but 'that the . contest" will , be -one .of thei- greatest spectacles . in the history of the' two -ecioplsi ' 1 : VThe.'Carnegie-Pitt scores for the past nine . ¡gamesshejis ; somé interesting light, .upon the Plaid’s rise in.gridiron circles : • ’ 'Pitt Carnegie

EDITOEIAL POINT OF VIEW
..“Toti watch the so-called Fine Arts,” said 
my .companion to me, by way of closing a pro­
longed discussion, “and you will see. them 
gradually . being assimilated; -with every-da.v- 
life and routine. Where r^e your, long, haired 
prophets of ehe last gcneration,7"vyith\ their 
yagü'e insistence on 'Art for Ari’e Si^e/.vrith' 
their theories' that, painting’. and .ihnsio.’are 
'things aloof, above the mob, without a .praß-, 
tical evaluation f They and their entire jargon 
of aesthetics lie buried, to eyer remain a cast 
.off bi-produot of an unpractical era. Today 
.the arts have a social import; they have be­
come highly important weapons in the hands 
of the educators and moralists.’’
We were speeding eastward on a long Santa.. 
Fe train. Late at night—and from-the obser­
vation, platform we watched an occassional 
green 'signal: fade until it became identified 
with the bold, headlight of the. following seer 
tion. Arts and'educative processes. My friend 
was a journalist from .»Kansas City. He ob­
served folks every day ; observed social- trends,
Oive me an ordinary eating joint,. of the' 
Pittsburgh variety, let me dress' it up with cre­
tonne curtains, plaster’the wallfi with Renais­
sance ornament,'fill the cornere with Roman 
statues, lighten it with mellowed electricity, 
incense mildly with- Tontines, and no matter 
how painful'* Pyrex plate lunch the particular 
Greek huckster who runs'tiie salon has to "of­fer, I will carefnlly lay‘.away ten stocking fulls 
of gold coins'a-week,'solid profit. -.
Give me a town hall full of womep—a fall 
symphony .orchestra, a baton swinger, from a 
large city, and let me' cause‘the, thrilling'pas­
sages of Tschaiflowsky ’a ‘‘1812, Overture” , to 
be sounded, ana I will have on my hands reg-
fervor.
r Take any first ra'te orator—well modulated 
voice, easy to look, at—give him a beautiful 
Gothic building, "fill tbe nave with high school, 
boys and girls, balance the picture nicely with 
stained gIass,.soft lights, finely chiseled imageô, 
a-lavish organ with a ‘‘vox humano” stop-V 
and the sky pilot will have at his command ' 
such a psychological palate that he may at 
will. draWv forth the tears or the’sighs, may 
¦gather about himself scores of converts to any- 
cause,he may be representing, whether it .be horee racing or polygamy. « .
And so does thia proatitution of the arts looin 
up as an important feature of our practical, 
times. Prostitution of music as a background - 
to our eating manners,prostitution, .of the yis ' 
ual 'and dramatic ar^s by . the moralist and 
propagandist to produce thé emotional .effects 
hé desires. Sociological investigationhaa it" 
that the arts may. be^utilized in feform work, 
in tlie prisons, may tie psychologically valuable
in the clearing up of. mental derangement. 
The harvest seems plentiful and the field is

The dwindling of sunny autumnal days and 
the rapid onrush of . winter has again summon- 
èd to fore the annual, issue of coal, warmth 
end smoke-. ‘Within & few weeks Pittsburgh 
will be-within the grip of a sun-covering 6moke 
¡which will feed, and garner its strength from 
thousands of homes and large industrial con- 
cerns'coily to overdrape the city with its soft, 
floaty black p'artidei... With an urged inten­
tion to combat this carbonizer of cities scienti-1 
-fically, Président Baker has issued invitations 
to mayors or • city . managers . of sixty large 
industrial centers and to .every governor in the 
United-States, welcoming their delegates to the 
International-Coal. Conference which will open 
at Carnegie,November Hr •
• Industrial scientists r have long recognized 
the import .of ; eliminating smoke from the. fac­
tory system,, since imperfect combustion is an 
economic waste and adds materially to iuel 
and power .costs. Even wjth' more adequate 
heating-'systems, the. thermal-effectiveness of 
the coal is not entirely utilized- and- many by­
products . ascend.as smoke* and shower the vi- 
cuirty with, its worthless remains.
But conservation and bètter utilization of 
coal-has directed coal ! research, during the 
past few years toward pre-heating of soft coal 
to pçodude oils, gases'ànd other .valuable by­
products . and then marketing, the residue, a 
semi-cake or char, as a, smokeless solid fuel for 
industrial and . domestic purposes. Various 
methods - and experiments - to - obtain these. spe­
cific.coal. products will be .presented by inter­
national. coai. authorities and' the conference 
hopes-to clear whether such processes, are com- 
mefciallyfèasihre. " \ -. ~
.-•’:'Dr. Baker, will, bring to the conference a' 
group of world éminent, scientists who have ad­
vanced the study of scientific and rational util* 
:ization of soft coal through., their research. Be­
sides discussing smokéless fuels, which is- one 
of, the many problems oo-related to the morfes
