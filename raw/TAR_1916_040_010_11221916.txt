ALTDOERFFER AT 
WEST PENN HOSPITAL
Although Badly Hurt is Re­
covering. No Permanent 
Injury Will Result.
Altdoerfer, although badly hurt in 
the Pitt-Tech clash last Saturday, 
laving two vertebrae in his neck 
chipped, is progressing very well at 
the West Penn hospital.
Immediately after his injury in the 
game, it was discovered that be was 
seriously hurt, and he was rushed to 
the West Penn hospital in an ambu­
lance. Upon his arrival at the hos­
pital, an X-ray examination revealed 
that two vertebrae in his neck were 
chipped. However, no serious or 
permanent Injury will result. At
FINLAY ELECTED TO 
LEAD FOOTBALL TEAM
Eighteen Letter Men Vote 
For Captain at Banquet 
Saturday Night.
At the banquet of the football 
team held at the Hotel Schenley on 
the night of the Pitt game, the 
eighteen letter men of the squad 
voted for a man to lead next year’s 
team. George E. Finlay, Industries 
’18, received a majority of. the votes 
and he is now the captain of the 
Plaid team.
“Nig,” as he is popularly called, 
entered Tech a year ago this fall. 
He enrolled in the printing course 
in the School of Applied Industries. 
That fall he Qjime out for the foot­
ball squad and without a bit of 
trouble showed Coach Steffen that 
the vacant right halfback position 
would be well taken care of by him. 
Finlay has taken care of this posi­
tion in a manner never before equal­
ed at Tech. "Nig” is heavy, but 
he is also fast and has no trouble 
in keeping up with his speedy team­
mates, Kesner and Marshall. His 
speed counts on end runs, and this 
speed along with his weight gives 
him an impetus in line bucking that 
even Pitt found hard to stop.
Finlay will have a hard time next

present his head, neck and shoulders 
are incased in a plaster cast. It is 
hoped, however, that he "will be able 
to leave the hospital within two or 
three weeks.
"Salt” has been the unfortunate j 
victim of injuries • throughout the 
season, and we heartily sympathize 
with this great player and wish him 
a speedy recovery..
Altdoerfer is a true, big-hearted 
Tech man, and it is with the deep­
est regret that this man, held in 
such high esteem, should be the un­
fortunate victim of so much suffer­
ing.

SUNNY KESNER
“Sunny” Kesner has played his last game for Carnegie! The memory of Tech’s wonderful 
little quarterback, the best football player who
ever wore a Plaid uniform, and whose unerringgeneralship is greatly responsible for the show­
ing of the Tech team during the last four years, 
will linger in the hearts of every loyal member 
of the Tech clan for years. The following words of “Sunny” are evidence of his great spirit: 
“We’ve started the roller towards our op­
ponent on the hill, and we'll crush him yet. To
beat or nearly beat the Pitt of today is not 
what it used to be, for they are conceded to be about the best in the country now, whereas then 
they were only W. U. P. I am Indeed very 
proud to have been a member of the team that boosted the stock of Carnegie’s football to the 
height of Pitt, Cornell, Penn, W. & J., Syracuse, 
State and Navy. I sincerely hope that the 
forces of good and clean players will be in­creased abundantly about Steffen, in order that 
he may build up a team still greater than the 
one of this year.”

Committees Appointed—M. 
M. C S. and Design School 
Girls to be Represented
The second regular meeting of the 
Student Activities Board was held 
a week ago last Wednesday evening.
Two of the most Important issues 
set forth were the appointment of a 
Budget Committee, whose duty will be 
to draw up the budget for the year 
and an Advisory Committee, the latter 
to keep in direct touch with the vari­
ous clubs and organizations of tho 
school, thereby bringing these organ­
izations Into closer relationship with 
the board. The Budget Committee 
consists of Dr. Esquerre, P. 0. Kling- 
ensmlth and H, W. Swanson, and tho 
Advisory Committee M. C. Adams, A. 
J. Hanks and R. K. Morker. Arrange­
ments wero also completed whereupon 
tho girls of the Margaret Morrison 
School and tho Design School are to 
have representatives on the board.
Several other Important matters 
have come before the board and a 
special meeting has been called, which 
took place last Wednesday.

Finlay, next year’s captain, spoke of 
the .necessity of procuring training 
quarters and new material.
Smokes were passed around and an 
entertaining program put on with 
Gearhart as master of ceremonies.
Director Hamerschlag spoke and 
emphasized the fact that Carnegie 
had won a moral victory over Pitt 
and should not copy the other 
school's principle of “No School Mon­
day.” Dr. Marks, Tom Orr, Bob Ver­
non, Coach Steffen sent his regrets 
through Dr. Marks of his inability to 
attend.
During the entertainment cider 
had been placed near the stairs and 
was well patronized by all. Gerry 
announced that a collection would be 
taken for flowers for “Salt” Altdoer- 
fer, who was hurt in the first quarter 
of play and was in the West Penn 
Hospital.
Too much credit for the fine show­
ing the Tech eleven made last season 
and thus far this fall crannot ibe giv­
en Coach Walter Steffen, the former 
University' of Chicago All-American 
quarterback. In fact, all the success 
should be laid at his door. He has 
raised football to a plane it never be­
fore knew at Tech and he has done 
it without going out of his way for 
ready-made stars. He has taken the 
players who responded to the call for 
material and has molded his own in­
dividual and combination good per­
formers.
And then there is Tom Orr. Quiet, 
not appearing to hurry, making no 
fuss iior commotion in his progress, 
he has yet engineered to a success-
ranged which Includes only members 
of the Tech family. The 'guests of 
tho evening will be tho trûstees, 
faculty, alumni and seniors, the 
most representative of the Tech 
followers.
We know that every Tech student 
will observe this holiday in a way 
befitting the occasion, and urge that 
each one of them do the part an- 
signed to them with a loyal spirit, 
being glad to take part in such an 
Important affair.

PITT WEEKLY ARTICLE.
TAILORINGLast year the students of this In­
stitution, with the most friendly 
spirit, and with the idea of promot­
ing a spirit of friendly rivalry be­
tween Pitt and Tech, gave a Pitt- 
Tech smoker in honor of the Pitt 
students. We felt that a step had 
been taken In tho right direction.
Still harboring this friendly feel­
ing, we were, shocked, amazed and 
truly Indignant to find an article 
in the official school paper of the 
University of. Pittsburgh, which was 
Insulting in the highest degree. Our 
first temptation was to retaliate. But 
as wo were hesitating, a letter re­
ceived from Graduate Manager Davis 
of Pitt, gave us assurance that the 
sentiment expressed in the "Pitt 
Weekly” was not that of the school. 
We had trusted that such was the case, 
and thus arrive at the conclusion that 
the sentiment expressed was merely 
the small, narrow-minded, child­
ish spirit of one rattle-brained 
fool on the staff of the “incompar­
able” sheet, the Pitt Weekly. Our 
friendly spirit toward Pitt remains 
the same; our estimation of the "Pitt 
Weekly” sinks to depths lower than 
we care to mention.
In order to assure the Tech stu­
dents of the sentiment at Pitt, we 
quote the following from Mr. Davis’ 
letter:
"I wish to state in the strongest 
terms possible that I, personally, or 
the members of the Athletic Cpuncil 
of Pittsburgh, or the majority of 
undergraduates and alumni of our 
Institution are positively opposed to 
such statements, and that they do 
not reflect the true feeling of Pitt 
adherents, as regards Tech and her 
athletics. We are all very sorry the 
article appeared, and while wo do 
not, In any sense, control the policy 
of, tho "Pitt Weekly,” we shall cer­
tainly do everything in our ppwer 
to prevent a reoccurrence.”
We thank Mr. Davis for this let­
ter. It has proven that our esteem 
of Pitt as an institution was well 
founded. And wo urge every Tech 
student to realize the facts of the 
case and to continue tho attitude of 
good fellowship for the Institution 
on tho hill.
Drop in at my tailoring shop any­time you're in Oakland and look over 
my new woolens.
I will be glad to greet you as a 
Tech student, and will see that you are fixed up right.

The school is with Captain Finlay,

PITT-TECH GAME.
Tho Pitt-Tech game of Inst Sat­
urday surpassing our fondest hopes, 
eclipses anything in tho week’s 00- 
curronco and makes all elso fade Into 
more Insignificance. We feel that 
something must bo said; wo must 
express our respect, admiration and 
appreciation to Coach Steffen and 
his men In some way, but how inad­
equate, how insignificant our words 
Will bo compared to tho accomplish­
ment ol! our great olovonl To 
(praise them sooms like an amateur 
attempting to realize and appreciate 
tho work of an artist.
Wo wont to tho gamo knowing wo 
had a good team, realizing their 
fighting spirit, HUHpoctlng Steffen's 
’strategy, hoping to hold tho Panth­
ers—wo admit, howovor, wo only 
hoped! And then In tho first mln- 
uto of play our hopes Boomed shat­
tered ; a fumblo, and a long run, 
and our team stood under the shad­
ow oil the goitl posts, (and. It did 
truly soom a shadow), already fac­
ing disaster. And suddenly as a bolt 
from tho already durlconed sky an­
other catastrophe occurred. The 
star fullback, Altdoerfer, a tower of 
strength, and 0110 of tho strongest 
members of our team, was badly in­
jured and removed from the game.
Almost any team would have fall­
en to pieces, would have become de­
moralized, and would have fought 
only listlessly. But the triie Tech 
spirit showed itself, the real mettle 
of the men became more evident, 
the latent power was aroused. Re­
fusing to admit defeat even in the 
face of great odds, the wonderful 
team fought, fought hard, played ac­
curately, employed every muscle, 
nerve and brain, and rose to a height 
never suspected by its most san­
guine admirers, and nearly dragged 
the "unconquerable” Panthers into 
the mire of defeat.
The much heralded "All-American” 
team; the "perfect Warner machine, 
'the famous Pitt interference and 
"stone wall” all failed to materialize 
under the Tech onslaught. And as 
usual the Tech spirit was also in 
predomiiianco in the cheering, and 
expressing its groat joy broke forth 
into a wild pandemonium, and knew 
no bounds when Tech’s scoro was 
registered.
Tho band also deserves tho high­
est praise, and not only dosorvos 
appreciation, but Is appreciated for 
Its excellent showing last Saturday.
All told, November 18th will go 
down in the annals of Tooh history, 
never to bo forgotten!

marks tho last social activity of this

ety bus always stood for tho highest 
standards in tho life of M. M. C. S. 
and endeavored at all times to pro­
mote tho true principles of Toeh 
spirit. As a social affair the lust 
dance was one of tho beSt during 
the school year. , Inasmuch as the 
girls, by their own choice decided 
to bar sororities in M. M. C. S., wo 
trust that their conscientious dec!-, 
sion may bring the results desired 
by them.

these scholarships which our grad­

it of helpfulness of the man who is

The half ended with the ball in 
Tech’s possession on the Pitt IS yard 
line. Score, Tech 0, Pitt 14.
Third 'Quarter.
Sies kicked out 01 bounds on 12 
and ball was brought back. Sies 
tried again and Finlay carried the 
ball from the 4 to the 32. Early 
could make no gain at center, Kesner 
swung around left end for 5, Mar­
shall got 2 at right tackle, Wright 
kicked out of bounds on Pitt’s 17 
from the Tech 42. Gougler was 
tackled by Gibson af.tor he had made
3 yards at right end, McLaren got 2 
at left tackle, Marshall tackled De­
Hart for no gain at left end. Miller 
kicked out of bounds on Tech’s 43 
from his own 23. Kesner was thrown 
for a two yard loss at right end.
TECH, OUT-WITTINGMarshall tallied around right end 
for 4, Altdoerfer got 1 at left guard. 
Finlay swung around left end for 5 
yards and a first down on Pitt’s 24. 
Kesner fumbled the next play and 
McLaren recovered for Pitt on the 
22 and carried it to Tech’s 37. Mar­
shall was all that was between him 
and a touchdown, but that was 
enough, for he threw him out of 
bounds and brought him down on ,the
PANTHER, SCORES
(Continued from Page One.) 
on account of his interference. To 
Wright is due an immeasurable 
amount of credit for his kicking and 
punting. Not once did he fail when 
it was up to him to boot the ball 
into the enemy’s territory. On de­
fense he was a tower of strength, 
tackling hard and sure; in fact so 
hard once that time was called until 
he could recover himself.
Kesner, one of the leading con­
tenders for the All-American quarter­
back honors, was held up somewhat 
by injuries he received in the early 
part of the game. His ankle, which 
has been troubling him more 'or less 
all season, came very near to giving 
out, but with his usual game spirit 
he put everything he had into the 
fight, and his efforts were by no 
means futile. He was a regular 
bugbear to the Pitt team, who were 
unable to solve his wily attack, and 
his repertoire of catchy plays. Ow­
ing to the condition of his ankle he 
was unable to travel fast enough 
around the ends to tally any great 
gains, but the way in which he 
handled the team was enough to sat­
isfy even the most exacting.
Finlay, captain-elect for 1917, 
proved to be a big man on the Plaid 
eleven, both on offense and defense. 
Numerous times he held the Pitt run­
ner for no gain or threw him for a 
loss, while his end runs were almost 
sure to bring results. To cap the 
climax he succeeded in wrapping 
himself around one of DeHart’s for­
ward passes and started the "ball 
rolling” for Tech.
Marshall, left half, played a peer­
less game. Starting with a right 
end run for 9 yards he continued 
his good work until the last gong 
was sounded. Not once was time 
called for “Phil,” who may be con­
sidered an exceedingly small fellow 
as compared with the Blue and Gold 
warriors. Much comment was made 
on his clever tackling on the defense.
To Early, substitute fullback, goes 
the crown for the day. It was he 
who received Kesner’s pass over the 
goal line for a score on Pitt. The 
followers of the Tech team are happy 
at the thought that Early will have 
three more years in school, during 
which time great things are expected 
of him.
The line was more than even the 
most sanguine had hoped for. In­
stead of repeated plunges through 
our line it seemed to be the other 
way. This was especially true at 
their center position, where Tech 
plowed through for considerable 
gains. The guards, and Heilstrom 
at center, could be no better, while 
Grady and McFeaters completely out­
classed the Pitt tackles all through 
the game.
Both teams appeared on the field 
at 2:40 o'clock. Pitt won the toss 
and elected to receive the kickoff. 
Both sides lined up and the whistle 
sounded the entry of Tech to bigger 
football circles at just 2:50 o’clock.
The game in detail:
First Period.
Wright kicked off for Tech. De­
Hart received the ball on the 2 yard 
line and carried it back to the 18, 
but fumbled when tackled and Tech 
recovered. Altdoerfer carried the ball 
around left end for 6 yards but 
fumbled.

was resumed, with Kesner still in 
the lineup. Kesner’s forward was 
broken down by Carlson. Wright 
kicked out of bounds on Pitt’s 3

at left tackle, McLaren kicked to 
Finlay on the 45. Marshall added 2

when a second such assembly can be
