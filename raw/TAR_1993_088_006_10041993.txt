SafeWalk escorts
start walking tonight
By ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Acting Business Manager
Starting today, SafeWalk will make 
CMU a safer campus. The program will 
be used to help insure the safety of 
students walking across campus in the 
evening and late-night hours. “Although 
it has taken nine months of painstaking 
planning, we have held on to the belief 
that this was a worthwhile project,” said 
David Wolpert, Student Government 
president.
SafeWalk was proposed last February 
by Wolpert and Kevin Bronke, a senior 
mechanical engineering major, in re­
sponse to a rape in Schenley Park in 
January 1993. “The program was first 
brought to Campus Police, who referred 
us to the then Student Government 
President Natalie Gesmond who was 
considering a similar program. Gesmond 
suggested that we present SafeWalk to 
Student Senate, which was very recep­
tive,” said Wolpert.
The program will use two escorters to 
escort students to their destination any­
where on campus — excluding off cam­
pus buildings. Bronke said that although 
the ideal situation would be to have a 
male and female on each escort job, so 
far they haven’t had enough female vol­
unteers. He hopes that will change as 
the program grows.
SafeWalk now has 24 volunteers, in­
cluding three women. According to 
Wolpert, there is one team per shift, and 
two shifts per night.
The hours will be every night from 10 
pm to 2 am. Wolpert hopes that will 
change. He said, “Our ultimate goal is to 
be in service at least six hours per night, 
from 9 pm to 3 am. How soon we can 
meet this goal depends on the number of 
volunteers we get and how much the 
service is used.”
SafeWalk escorters will be dispatched 
from Baker Hall Eoom 255A, where a 
telephone and radio have been installed. 
Students, faculty, and staff who want an 
escort should call 268-SAFE (x8-7233). 
If a group of four or more people calls for 
an escort, they will be denied. The rea­
son, as Wolpert explained, is that the 
program is based on the concept of safety

Oelay of Skibo demolition 
)ossible; fundraising needed
ly JASON TOGYER
'artan Assistant News Editor
The University expects to de- 
de soon when the demolition of 
ikibo Hall will begin, according 
to Jeffrey Bolton, assistant vice 
jresident for planning and bud- 
t.
‘A final timetable has not been 
lecided,” said Bolton. “The deci­
sion will be made before No­
vember 1 whether or not to 
)egin the demolition at the 
¡nd of January or to post- 
one it until May.”
Bolton said that the work 
•n the $45 million Univer- 
lity Center project can not 
iroceed until fundraising is 
ompleted. “All of the con- 
itruction plans have been 
¡ompleted,” said Bolton.
We’re ready to go out to bid 
bn the project.”
Eric Johnson, vice presi- 
lent for development, said 
;hat the project is a “top pri- 
>rity for me and my staff, 
and for the trustees.”
“We’re still trying to raise 
.'the money for the University Cen- 
** said Johnson. “We need a 
sufficient level of commitment. If 
'e were building a $5 or $6 mil­
lion dormitory, we might be able 
find someone who would be 
ible to give us the money. But it’s 
little different when you’re talk­
ing about $40-$45 million. It be­
dtimes composed of many gifts, 
id getting enough gifts to add 
[Up to $45 million is not that easy.” 
“Fundraising is a difficult busi­
ness. I think we have a large 
number of alumni with a strong 
commitment to the project,” 
Johnson said, “but this is a very 
big project requiring a large com­
mitment.”
“We’re working on it. We’re 
working hard on it. The presi­
dent is making calls to alumni,” 
said Johnson. “We just sat down 
to talk to Dr. Mehrabian about
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art Editor
the calls that he has to make for 
fundraising purposes.”
Work is also progressing on the 
acquistion of the former Naval 
Reserve Center, said Bolton. “We 
are finalizing the acquisition,” 
Bolton said. “We’re going to make 
it happen as quickly as possible.” 
The Navy has opened its new 
Reserve Center in North Ver­
sailles, south of Pittsburgh.
State’and government environ­
mental evaluations are the only
remaining obstacle to the Naval 
Center purchase, according to 
Bolton. “The Navy needs to sub­
mit a building environmental 
analysis,” he said. “The disposal 
of any federal building has to go 
through this.’’The evaluation will 
be completed by the state De­
partment of Environmental Re­
sources and the U.S. Environ­
mental Protection Agency, said 
Bolton. He added that neither 
side forsees any problems, and 
after the studies are completed 
“we can proceed very quickly.” 
Minor renovations are neces­
sary to the Naval Center, said 
Bolton. “We’ll have to do some 
things to bring the building up 
to ADA [Americans with Dis­
abilities Act] requirements,” he 
said. These include “upgrading 
restrooms, access to the build­
ing, that sort of thing.”
The best case scenario, said 
Bolton, would allow student 
organizations to begin moving 
into the building sometime be­
tween the beginning of Decem­
ber and the end of January. “It 
will be based on the schedules 
of the students,” he said. “We’ll 
try to pick a time that’s appropri­
ate.”
Anne Witchner, dean of stu­
dent activities, said that student 
leaders are working with her de­
partment to allocate space to stu­
dent groups. “They haven’t made 
any final decisions yet,” said 
Witchner, “because they’re wait­
ing to see if any more space gets 
freed up.” Assistant Director of

Hunt will return to old hours
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan News Editor
At Tuesday’s Student Senate 
meeting, Charles Lowry, univer­
sity librarian, announced dur­
ing audience participation that 
Hunt Library will open its entire 
facilities until 3 am for study 
use. During the extended hours, 
the library will collect data on 
the use of the library after mid­
night. The extension of the hours 
will, so far, apply only to this 
semester, after which the col­
lected data will be evaluated, 
according to Lowry.
Lowry said that he had a meet-
ingwith Provost Paul Christiano, 
andChristiano offered the money 
needed to open the library until 
3 am. “The Provost asked that 
hard data get collected, [and] he 
wanted to know if there’s sub­
stantial use,” said Lowry.
Lowry also said that he does 
want to “nail down” what data 
will be collected, but he said that 
one obstacle remains — student 
employment. Because of that ob­
stacle, the library will open to 3 
am “no later than next Sunday,” 
Lowry said.
Last year, according to Lowry, 
the only data collected was an 
hour-by-hour count of people on
each floor and entering/exiting 
gate counts. “The data doesn’t 
talk about the use of resources, 
though,” said Lowry. Lowry said 
that the additional data collected 
would include the use of Library 
Information System (LIS) termi­
nals on a half-hour interval, pick­
up materials, copying on other 
than the first floor, and reserve 
reading.
Lowry said at the meeting that 
the data collected by the library 
administration will be brought 
to Student Senate’s Campus Af­
fairs (CA) Committee, chaired 
by MCS Senator Tony DeRoss.

Heinz School celebrates 25th
By EDWARD HAYES
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The H. John Heinz III School of 
Public Policy and Management is 
celebrating its 25th anniversary 
here at CMU. The anniversary 
celebration opened up with a din­
ner Sunday and will continue with 
an open forum titled, “Getting 
Cities to Work: A Policy Forum 
on Creating Jobs and Enhancing 
Competency.” The forum will con­
clude Tuesday.
The dinner was held at the 
University Club and was high­
lighted with Pennsylvania State 
Representative Tom Murphy’s 
address on a beneficial relation­
ship between the University and 
the community.
In addition, John Pazour, city 
manager of Arosa, Colorado and
alum of Heinz School, received 
the Public Service Award for his 
work as the Deputy Secretary of 
Welfare in Pennsylvania and for 
performing his duties as City 
Manager in one of the top 100 
cities in the nation, according to 
Governing Magazine.
Among some ofthe other speak­
ers on hand Sunday were Will­
iam Cooper, founding dean; 
Alfred Blumstein, the current 
dean of Heinz School; and a host 
of other previous deans of the 
school. During the forum, Lieu­
tenant Governor MarkSingel will 
make a presentation entitled, 
“Jobs in Our Cities: A Pennsylva­
nia Perspective.”
The Heinz School, formerly 
known as the School of Urban 
and Public Affairs (SUPA), was 
created in 1968 when Richard
King Mellon contributed $10 mil­
lion to CMU to establish a public 
policy and management school. 
The school’s basic policy is to give 
students the skills that are. 
needed to achieve academic suc­
cess.
“We have had a major commit- 
mentto recruiting, educating, and 
supporting minorities because 
they are tied in with the public 
interest,” Blumstein said. The 
school continues that philosophy 
with 25 pero^nt of their gradu­
ates being people of color.
SUPA was renamed the Heinz 
School on April 6,1992, in honor 
of the late Senator John Heinz 
who was killed in an airplane 
crash the year before.

the school after a distinguished

Clinton urges support for Russian president
WASHINGTON, October 3 
(AP) — President Bill Clinton 
says the United States must 
not waver in its support for 
Russian PresidentBoris Yeltsin 
as his battle against conserva­
tive forces erupts into violence 
on the streets of Moscow. Do­
ing so, he says, would encour­
age people who want to derail 
the election process and reform 
in Russia.
Speaking to reporters at the 
White House, Clinton says the 
U.S. must continue to support 
“the process of bringing about 
free and fair elections.” 
Clinton’s comments came about 
two hours after Yeltsin declared 
a state of emergency in Mos­
cow.
Clinton told reporters that
there has been “significant vio­
lence” in Moscow today. He 
says that violence was clearly 
perpetrated by hard-liners op­
posed to Yeltsin. Clinton says 
Yeltsin has “bent over back­
wards” to avoid excessive use of 
force in the nearly two-week- 
old standoff with hard-line 
Communist lawmakers.
The rioters overwhelmed 
hundreds of riot police in vi­
cious street fighting. Russian 
press reports say at least two 
soldiers have been killed. Doz­
ens of people have beeninjured.
Clinton made the remarks as 
he prepared to leave Washing­
ton for a televised town meet­
ing tonight in California. He 
says he has not spoken to 
Yeltsin today.
Former ambassador calls 
events in Moscow "scary’
WASHINGTON, October 3 
(AP)—FormerUnitedNations 
ambassador Jeanne Kirk­
patrick calls the situation in 
Moscow “scary,” and says the 
U.S. is right in continuing to 
back Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin.
Thousands of anti-Yeltsin 
demonstrators routed police in 
central Moscow today as they 
fought their way to the Russian 
parliament building.
Kirkpatrick, speaking on
ABC television this morning, 
says the situation is scary be­
cause much depends on what 
the Russian security forces do. 
She says if they continue to 
back Yeltsin, the Russian presi­
dent will surwe this threat to 
his authority.
Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), 
also interviewed on ABC, says 
Yeltsin’s hard-line opponents 
are behind today’s violence. He 
says they’ve wanted a confron­
tation with Yeltsin.
First lady takes health­
care proposal to Florida
ORLANDO, Fla., October 3 
(AP)—Hillary Rodham Clinton 
is urging Florida’s Democrats 
to support her husband’s na­
tional health care plan, fresh 
from her visit to Capitol Hill 
last week.
Clinton told a supportive au­
dience that the President’s pro­
posal will give working people 
the same break that welfare 
recipients enjoy.
Clinton made her appeal 
_ while addressing the statewide 
; Democratic conference yester- 
; day in Orlando, She said “a lot 
; of the people who work hard for 
a living” don’t have health in­
surance — while those on wel­
fare do.
The first lady also said the 
President won’t back away from 
his insistence that everyone be 
covered under a national health 
care program.
And she drew heavy applause 
by sayingthat society must take 
a stand against violence by 
“taking guns out of the hands 
of teenagers.”
Florida has been shaken by 
the killing of three foreign visi­
tors during the past month. 
The killings have gotten wide­
spread attention in the inter­
national news media.
Dozen shots fired at city home
PITTSBURGH, October 2 (AP) 
—Police say a 51 -year-old woman 
escaped serious injury when 
someone fired more than a dozen 
shots into her house.
The woman was not imme­
diately identified by police. She 
was lying on a couch when the 
gunfire began Friday night.
A witness told police that he 
saw someone fire nine shots, af­
ter which he fled into a nearby 
house in the city’s Hill District 
neighborhood.
After that, the witness says he 
heard four more shots. The wo­
man was treated for a broken foot 
at Presbyterian-University Hos­
pital.
FBI releases 1992 crime statistics
. WASHINGTON, October 3 
(AP) — The Federal Bureau of 
Investigation has mixed news 
about crime reported to police 
last year — the total number of 
crimes was down, but violent 
crimes were up.
The FBI says the total number 
of crimes dropped 2.9 percent to 
14.4 million. That’s the first an­
nual decline since 1984.
Violent crimes — such as mur­
der, rape, and robbery — in­
creased a little more than one 
percent, to 1.9 million.
FBI Director Louis Freeh says 
he’s pleased the total number of 
crimes is down, but worried that 
violent crime is up.
So is Geoffrey Alpert, professor 
of criminology and criminal jus­
tice at the University of South 
Carolina. He says the FBI’s sta­
tistics show that young people 
are committing more violent acts.Health care reform goes to Congress
WASHINGTON, October 1 (DJ)
— After First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton’s five appear­
ances in three days on Capitol 
Hill, legislators know nothing 
more than they did before about 
the financing of the Clinton 
administration’s massive health­
care reform plan.

Although Clinton won praise 
for her calm, polished perfor­
mance, she revealed little beyond 
what’s been published in the 
widely circulated draft of the 
President’s proposal.
While she offered on several 
occasions to “get those numbers 
foryou” when asked specific ques­
tions on financing, the first lady 
sidestepped several opportunities 
to do so publicly.
Senate Finance Committee 
Chairman Daniel P. Moynihan 
(D-N.Y.) wondered how the ad­
ministration could predict that 
medical spendingwouldnotgrow 
faster than the rate of inflation 
through the year 2000, especially 
since medical prices have grown 
875 percent since 1960 while con­
sumer prices rose 375 percent.
“How would that survive the 
reality check?” Moynihan asked 
Clinton, noting that the Presi­
dent had pledged to build “a con­
tinuing reality check” as he de­
veloped his health-care reform 
plan.
Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.), appealed for 
straight talk on financing. There 
must be “no rosy scenarios, no 
smoke and mirrors, no juggling 
the books.”
Clinton did her best to reassure 
legislators that the plan’s financ­
ing elements were solidly re­
searched by number crunchers in 
and out of the federal govern­
ment.
As projected, $441 billion in 
new revenues through the year 
2000 — mostly from savings in 
the current health care system— 
will fund $350 billion in new pro­
grams.
These programs are expected 
to include long-term health ben­
efits for the elderly, a drug ben­
efit for all Americans and insur­
ing the approximately 37 million 
Americans who do not have health 
insurance.
The remaining $91 billion will 
be used for deficit reduction, but 
Office of Management and Bud­
get Director Leon Panetta has 
said that figure is “going to be 
vulnerable on Capitol Hill.”
Clinton said the uninsured 
could be brought into the system 
without a broad-based tax. In­
stead, a tax on tobacco, which 
would add somewhere between 
75 cents and one dollar to the 
price of a pack of cigarettes, plus 
a payroll surcharge of about 1 
perecent on corporations that self- 
insure, would provide revenue.
So would cutting the “waste,
fraud, and abuse” from the 
nation’s nearly $1 trillion health 
care system. And revenues from 
the current system of employer- 
and-employee-paid health insur­
ance premiums would also fund 
much of the health reform ef­
forts.
While some Americans — 
mostly younger people who have 
benefited from an insurance sys­
tem that favors healthy people— 
would pay more for their health 
care, about 63 percent of Ameri­
cans would pay the same or less 
for similar or improved health 
care benefits, she said.
The first lady also stated that 
forcing employers to cover em­
ployees would not cause wide­
spread job losses because a ma­
jority of companies already do so.
Fire rages near Jackson ranch
SANTA YNEZ, California, Oc­
tober 3 (AP) — Fire crews have 
set backfires next to Michael 
Jackson’s Neverland ranch to 
beat back an advancing wildfire.
They set the fires near the east­
ern boundary of Jackson’s ranch 
to starve a spot fire that’s charred 
4,500 acres.
A Forest Service spokesperson 
says the effort, combined with a 
shift in winds, is halting the 
flames’ advance.
If the weather continues to co­
operate, firefighters expect to con­
tain a huge blaze in the Padres 
National Forest this week.
Forest Service crews have sur­
rounded 75 percent of the 3,700 
acre fire so far, and hope to have 
it fully encircled by Tuesday 
evening.
High court set to begin fall session
WASHINGTON, October 3 
(AP) — Tomorrow is the first 
Monday in October, and that 
means the Supreme Court will 
open its fall term.
Three voting rights cases are 
first up for consideration. They 
could help clarify the court’s views 
on what protection the 1965 Vot­
ing Rights Act gives to minority 
voters.
The nine justices face a variety 
of issues this term.
They will have to decide 
whether the rap group 2 Live
Crew’s unauthorized parody 0f 
Roy Orbison’s song “Oh, Pretty 
Woman” amounted to copyright 
infringment.
The court will also hear a re-' 
quest from abortion rights advo. 
cates who want to use federal 
racketeering laws to prevent 
blockades of health clinics that 
perform abortions. ,
Singel plans run for top state post
HARRISBURG, Pa., October3 
(AP) — Pennsylvania’s acting 
governor, Mark Singel, says he 
expects GovemorBob Casey back 
at the helm by the end of the year. 
But in the mean time, Singel'i^ 
making ambitious plans to set an 
agenda for the state.
Singel, the commonwealth’s 
lieutenant governor since 1986, 
has largely been regarded as a, 
political lightweight. His stoclf 
among pundits has risen consid­
erably since assuming control of 
the state.
Singel told the Democratic 
State Committee meeting over 
the weekend in Harrisburg that' 
he wants to be remembered as 
someone who took giant steps.
Singel — an expected candi­
date for the party’s nomination 
for governor next year — says he. 
wants to undertake a perfor­
mance review to make sure state 
government is running as effi­
ciently and effectively as possible.
When the state Senate does 
return in November, Singel says 
he expects tax reform and busi­
ness tax cuts will be on the 
agenda.
He says the legislature should 
“take a shot at delivering mean­
ingful tax reform for the first tim^ 
in thirty years this fall.”
Singel has been serving as act 
ing governor since June when 
Casey received a new heart and 
liver. Casey is back in Presbyte- 
rian-University Hospital in Pitts-, 
burgh fighting a viral infection.

Also, students must call from on cam­
pus in order to receive an escort. Every 
% escort team will be easily identifiable by 
t their uniform, which consists of a blue 
windbreaker with “SafeWalk” inscribed 
in large white letters, and a plastic ID 
holder, with the escorter’s student ID 
inside.
) In addition, ______________________
‘ according to Di- 
' rector of Campus
¦ Security James 
.LaPaglia, each 
“„team will be 
equipped with a 
.walkie talkie.
..This will allow 
..the escorters to 
communicate 
..with the central
y. dispatcher and also to keep them in 
contact with Campus Police who will be 
listening to every transmission that the 
teams make. Thus, if there is a problem, 
police will be able to respond immedi- 
f ately. Additional security measures will 
be that each escort team will carry a loud 
whistle that will be used for signaling 
. other escort teams and, hopefully, deter 
, an unwanted situation, said Bronke.
LaPaglia said that while any student 
may volunteer, “There will be a criminal 
i background check [on volunteers] that 
will be run through the state police and
the FBI.” According to LaPaglia, this 
will be done in order to help guarantee 
the integrity of the SafeWalk program. 
Not only will the students receive a 
background check, they will also have to 
go through a training program that out­
lines the escorts’ responsibilities and job 
functions.
SafeWalk was started by students and 
will continue to be run by students, said 
LaPaglia. He said that all his office is 
doing is providing advice and support.

Libraries will change circulation policy
HUNT, from page 1
According to DeRoss, the CA Committee 
met with Barbara Richards, associate 
university librarian, andBarbaraYaunt, 
circulation services supervisor for Uni­
versity Libraries. “We [discussed] the 
criteria necessary in constructing a new 
study of how the library is used after 
hours,” said DeRoss.
DeRoss said that they were not sure of 
the final outcome of that meeting, how­
ever. “Basically, we got to a point where 
we ran out of time,” DeRoss said. “Rep­
resentatives from Student Senate felt 
that the only way to get a valid study 
would be to reinstate the library’s 
old hours.”
DeRoss said that Lowry’s an­
nouncement to Student Senate 
was a “pleasant surprise.” How­
ever, DeRoss said that future cor­
respondence between Student 
Senate and University Libraries 
will be through the Academic Af­
fairs (AA) Committee, chaired by 
H&SS Senator Dawn Wall- 
hausen. DeRoss said that the AA 
Committee wasn’t originally con-
Theodore Yip, an undergraduate stu­
dent who graduated last semester.
The Undergraduate Task Force met 
on four topics. The first topic addressed 
was undergraduate library instruction. 
“Assistance is needed to exploit our in­
formation resources,” said Lowry. Two 
recommendations made by Lowry are to 
establish a classroom for teaching, and 
integrating library services into Com­
puting Skills Workshop to develop an 
“Information Skills Workshop.”
Lowry addressed the study environ­
ment as his second topic. This topic 
addressed space planning as a primary

Student Senate [about] large 
changes within the library. ”

was brought before Senate was chang­
ing the reserve system from open to 
closed. Hunt Library now uses an open 
reserve system, in which there is very 
little control over who has the books, 
when they will be returned, and when 
they are reshelved. Lowry said that 
moving to a closed reserve system would 
be better but would require basic remod­
eling and advance planning.
Finally, Lowry discussed possible 
changes in the circulation policy, which 
was voted upon by Faculty Senate. Some 
of the changes include a 30-day sign-out 
period instead of the current 21-day pe­
riod, and giving a grace pe­
riod of three days for overdue 
books. “We’ll be installing the 
new system in December,” 
said Lowry.

fairs, said, “We [the administration] had 
very little to do with getting this pro­
gram going. Although we did help with 
financing, I think that this is an excel­
lent example of student initiative at 
CMU.
“This program is very important, 
whether the students use it or not, be­
cause it gets the message out that stu­
dents need to be responsible for their 
safety,” Murphy said. “This shows CMU 
has a nurturing environment when stu­
dents are willing to help other students.”
last semester’s chair. “He will meet with 
the AA Committee about future 
changes,” DeRoss said.
At the Senate meeting, Lowry also 
addressed a report released from the 
Undergraduate Task Force, a sub-com­
mittee of Faculty Senate that convened 
last year.
“The purpose [of the committee] was 
to tackle problems related to library 
service needs,” said Lowry.
Lowry said that the Undergraduate 
Task Force was comprised of depart­
ment heads, Mark Kantrowitz, a gradu­
ate computer science student, and
study space are inadequate. According 
to a printed report, Hunt Library’s space 
is at 97 percent capacity, and the Engi­
neering & Science (E&S) Library has 99 
percent capacity.
Lowry said, “The long term solution 
[for Hunt] is to reallocate space in the 
basement,” which is now occupied by 
Instructional Technology and the Apple 
Orchard, Hunt’s Macintosh computer 
cluster.
According to Lowry, to solve the space 
problem for the E&S Library, space 
would need to be doubled.
Another change in Hunt Library that
protest the decision originally made by 
University Libraries to close Hunt Li­
brary at midnight. According to CIT 
Senator Greg Haverkamp, the decision 
to change the hours involved no input 
from the student body.
When Lowry announced that Hunt 
Library will remain open to 3 am, the 
protest scheduled for last Thursday was 
canceled.
“[Lowry] hasn’t been here very long,” 
said DeRoss. “He didn’t know how to get 
student input. There is no prior record of 
this. The library will always ask Stu­
dent Senate [about] large changes within 
the library. I think there are a lot of 
positive outcomes.”

Audience Participation: Dr.
¦yjCharles Lowry addressed Senate 
. about several issues. First he 
discussed the issue of library
hours. Paul Christiano, the 
Provost, agreed to give the funds 
necessary to keep all floors of 
Hunt open until 3 am for the rest 
of the semester. This offer is a 
one-time deal only, and data will 
be collected during this period to 
determine precise usage statistics 
for Hunt. He hope that University 
Libraries can resume the 
extended hours beginning next 
Sunday. He would like to have 
Campus Affairs assist him with 
data collection and analysis.
Lowry assured Senate that he 
is committed to keeping the 
library open for study until 3am 
no matter what the outcome of 
the study. Lowry also discussed 
the possibility of adding a specific 
section for LIS II instruction to 
the CSW curriculum. Also, he 
discussed the Library’s 
commitment to improving the 
study environment at all 
University Libraries. They want 
to add more seats, more space for 
group study and other major 
improvements. He also 
announced some changes in 
circulation and enforcement 
policies.

person from this area,” said 
Blumstein. Heinz’s commitments to 
public service, effective public poli­
cies, and finding a way for both the 
public and private sectors to work 
together were consistent with the 
school.
The main thrusts of the Heinz 
School is in the area of business 
with a Master of Science and a Mas­
ter of Arts Management (MAM) to 
add to its credit.
The MAM program, recently 
added to the curriculum, works 
jointly with the College of Fine Arts. 
Its primary focus is management in 
the performing and visual arts.
The school’s three strongest pro­
grams are economic development, 
criminal justice and labor econom­
ics.
Over the past several years, the 
Heinz School has developed the 
reputation of being the strongest 
public policy school in research and 
in most quantitative curriculum 
programs and nature of research 
programs.
Many of the school’s graduates go 
on to become managers and ana­
lysts in key positions in government, 
industry, and non-profit organiza­
tions.
Looking to the future, the Heinz 
School will be looking into the press­
ing problem of health care.
“We are seeking to recruit a 
chaired professor in health care”, 
said Blumstein. The school is also 
looking to build up an environment 
area of management.
Skibo destruction now in question

overseeing the committee in charge of can start moving in.
space allocation.
The committee was appointed and 
people volunteered through Student 
Senate last semester, said Gorman, and 
is composed of senators, non-senators, 
and graduate students.
“Organizations were notified 
last semester and completed 
space allocation requests,” said 
Gorman. “We spent most of the 
summer looking over them, and 
we are now in the process of 
summarizing our evaluations.”
The process will likely be com­
plete by October 15, she said.
Gorman said that it is possible 
that more organizations will be 
accommodated in the Naval Cen­
ter than are currently housed in 
Skibo.
“The nice thing about the 
building is that the offices are 
very large,” said Gorman. “I 
think that it could be quite pos­
sible for more than one organi­
zation to share an office.”
Four of the rooms in the Naval 
Center will be used as class­
rooms. In addition, the drill deck, 
used by the Navy for training 
exercises, will be used as an as­
sembly room. It will not replace 
the Skibo Ballroom, however, 
said Gorman. “The drill deck can only 
hold 200 people, where the ballroom 
could seat 600,” she said. The University 
is currently negotiating with off-cam­
pus facilities for a room for special events.
“As soon as the government paper­
work is complete, we’ll begin acquisi­
tion,” Bolton said. “Even if the demoli­
tion of Skibo is postponed,” the Univer-
Dining facilities on campus will un­
dergo a major realignment when Skibo 
closes, said Bolton. “When Skibo is de­
molished, the Morewood Gardens facil­
ity will be reopened and cart service on
While no decision has been reached on the University 
Center project, work continues on the renovation of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall rotunda.
campus [similar to that in Wean Hall] 
will be expanded.”
It is not likely, however, that cart 
service will be available in the Naval 
Center, said Roger Heydt, director of 
dining services. “When Kiltie Court 
closes, Morewood Gardens will be re­
opened,” Heydt said. “At least one more 
food format will be placed in Morewood
Court.” Heydt said the format could in­
clude fast food or salads, but that More­
wood will not revert to a full-service 
cafeteria.
Heydt said that Morewood Gardens 
was closed because the number of people 
using the facility did not warrant keep­
ing it open.
“We are planning on expand­
ing all of the cart facilities,” 
said Heydt. Cart facilities are 
currently in place in GSIA, 
HamburgHall, Wean Hall, and 
Mellon Institute. The carts will 
also begin accepting Campus- 
Xpress and DineXpress, he 
said.
Heydt said that Dining Ser­
vices will only open another 
cart if the current facilities can­
not meet demand. “The only 
place that I cculd see that we
o had enough space for one is
S possibly in Baker Hall,” said 
¦§ Heydt. Carts are somewhat in- 
a. trusive, however. “If you have 
| an office two doors down from 
a cart, it can be unpleasant,” 
| he said. “We are sensitive to 
¦j that.
•“§ “We are as anxious as every- 
jj one else to see this project [the 
University Center] get under­
way,” said Heydt. “Our objec­
tive is to meet everyone’s din­
ing needs. We don’t plan on 
folding up our tents and going away 
during construction.”
“I quickly realized that [the Univer­
sity Center] would be my top priority 
when I arrived here a year ago,” said 
Johnson. “We are really working as hard 
as we can on this. There isn’t a day that 
goes by that I don’t think about it.
“We’re doing our best,” he said.

Crime and Incident Report
9/17 SUSPICIOUS PERSON,
10:50 am. Campus Police received 
several calls that four people were 
seen around the Morewood bike 
rack and then the GSIA bike rack. 
—Thefourindividuals were stopped
¦ by an officer. Due to the over 14 
bicycle thefts, the four were asked 
why they were in the area. The 
four people said that they were 
from Schenley High School. The 
principal of the high school was 
contacted and requested that the 
students be brought back to the 
high school.
Prior to transport, the students 
were frisked. One officer discov- 
1 ered a pair of bolt cutters. A com­
plaint was filed with juvenile 
court.
| 9/18 THEFT/RECOVERY,
2:30 am. An officer was respond- 
" mg to a verbal confrontation be- 
! tween two people at Forbes and 
Morewood Avenues. The two 
people were both carrying items 
when they saw the responding 
officer.
! One carried a 3' by 6" wooden 
paddle and a plaque. He walked 
between Morewood E-Tower and 
the cafeteria. The other person 
walked behind Morewood Gar­
dens D-Tower onto Morewood 
i) Avenue with a gold trophy and a 
framed picture.
The responding officer stopped 
the second person, who admitted 
removing the items from a Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh fraternity
y near Pitt stadium, without their 
; knowledge. He was identified as 
a CMU student. CMU police will 
check with Pitt police to see if
¦ these items were stolen; if so, the 
studentwill be cited through Stu­
dent Affairs.
Later, the student returned 
with the other two items but re­
fused to give the name of the 
other person. The items were con­
fiscated and brought to 155 Baker 
Hall. A detective will check with 
Pitt police to see if this is an on­
going prank between CMU and 
Pitt fraternities.
9/18 RETAIL THEFT, 12:27 
pm. A cashier at Entropy observed 
somebody carrying a clear plastic 
laundry-type bag who appeared 
to be removing merchandise. As 
the cashier tried to get a better 
view, another person tried to dis­
tract the cashier.
When the cashier started to 
walk from the counter to the rear 
aisle, the thief fled the store and 
left Skibo. The distracter also left 
the area.
Campus Police responded and 
made a check of the area and 
surrounding streets with no re­
sult.
9/19 UNDERAGE DRINK­
ING, 2:20 am. Two campus po­
lice officers were patrolling the 
fraternity driveway when they 
were nearly run over by a car that 
was traveling at a high speed. 
The car stopped but not before 
the officers had to jump out of its 
way. The driver was asked if he 
was drinking that night and he 
said that he was. His breath also 
smelled of alcohol. The driver was 
19 years old and was issued an 
internal citation for underage 
drinking.
He was also requested to sub­
mit to a field sobriety test before 
being allowed to drive again. He
performed the finger-to-the-nose 
adequately and he was able to 
follow a moving pen with his eyes 
with no difficulty. He was then 
told to drive home within the 
speed limits.
9/19 THEFT, 2:27 am. Two of­
ficers responded to a call that 
someone had just stolen a pizza 
from a Dominos delivery man at 
the Morewood Gardens A-Tower 
desk. The delivery man said that 
three individuals who had or­
dered on the same receipt met 
him at the phone to pick them up.
The first individual signed and 
paid for his pizza, but before the 
other two individuals signed for 
theirs, they grabbed the pizzas 
and ran into A-Tower towards 
the E-Tower walkway.
While an attempt was being 
made to check the phone num­
bers that were on the Dominos 
receipt, the delivery man pointed 
out one of the thieves, who was 
walking in the lower lobby. As 
the responding officer approached 
him, he was walking through the 
hallway to E-Tower, highly in­
toxicated and stumbling. He also 
had so much pizza in his mouth 
that he could not speak.
He took the responding officers 
to his floor. When officers en­
tered the floor, another one of the 
thieves who was in the hallway 
ran back into his room and 
slammed the door. Inside that 
room, the officers saw the stolen 
pizzas.
The two students were advised 
that a report would be written 
about the incident and that inter- 
nal citations will be issued 
through Student Affairs. Domi­

9/19 DELIVERY OF SUS­
PECTED COCAINE, 8:30 am. 
Two CMU police detectives con­
ducted a surveillance of the A- 
level computer machine room of 
Cyert Hall in response to sus­
pected drug sales and activity 
taking place therein.
A man was observed giving a 
co-worker a small packet and re­
ceiving an amount of cash in re­
turn. The co-worker was found to 
have a substance suspected to be 
cocaine, and the actor had pos­
session of five $5 bills. The co­
worker admitted that he received 
what was believed to be cocaine 
from the actor.
The actor was placed under 
arrest and given Miranda warn­
ings at 155 Baker Hall. The actor 
was then interrogated and taken 
to Pittsburgh Police.
9/22 INFORMATION RE­
CEIVED, 10:09 pm. Over the 
past few weekends during night 
hours, CMU police have been re­
sponding to complaints of loud 
explosions in the Hill dorm area. 
The explosions can be heard at 
least as far away as the frater­
nity area.
These explosions were first 
heard around July. When CMU 
police check the area, they find 
no evidence of firecrackers or 
similar devices. Occasionally, re­
mains of a plastic soda bottle will 
be found, but no other debris can 
be located.
A confidential informant in­
formed Campus Police that resi­
dents of Scobell Hall obtained 
liquid nitrogen from the third 
floor of Wean Hall. With the liq­
uid nitrogen, students can mix 
the liquid nitrogen with water 
inside a soda bottle, cap it, and 
toss it. The water reacts in a 
violent explosion but the reac­
tants quickly evaporate. Other­
wise, they mix the water and ni­
trogen in a pipe and use it to 
launch golf balls at Donner Hall.
Campus Police informed 
MEMS personnel who use liquid 
nitrogen that tanks should be 
locked up the following weekend.
9/24 WEAPONS VIOLA­
TION, 2:30 pm. A complainant 
reported that two people were on 
a fraternity porch shooting a BB 
gun. A detective came onto the 
porch and heard the fraternity 
president say, “You probably 
shouldn’t be shooting anything 
right now.” This was said right 
after a shot was fired.
The detective ordered the 
shooter to place the weapon on 
the patio floor and back away. 
Two officers came to assist. The 
weapon was a Crossman Air Guns 
Model AAII. One of the officers 
unloaded the BBs from the gun 
and rendered it safe. The weapon 
and partially filled box of BBs 
was confiscated and placed into 
evidence. The shooter was issued 
an internal citation for the pos­
session and discharge of a 
weapon.
9/25 INCIDENT, 12:07 am. A 
complainant phoned Campus 
Police and stated that the keys to 
the Morewood Gardens Recre­
ation Room and somebody’s per­
sonal items were locked inside a 
closet and requested that the door 
be unlocked. An officer responded 
and found that no key on any key 
ring nor any sign-out key avail­
able to Campus Police opened the 
closet.
At about 2 am, the complain­
ant said that she contacted some­
one from Housing requesting to 
break the door down to gain en­
try because someone’s heart medi-.' 
cation was inside and they needed 
it before going home. The locking 
cylinder to the closet was knocked 
off with a hammer and screw­
driver. A maintenance request 
will be submitted to have the lock 
repaired. All personal items, in­
cluding the keys to lock the recre- , 
ation room and the heart medica- I 
tion were removed from the closet.

democracy and freedom. At the heart of 
his “argument” lies the Orwellian logic 
of watered-down neoconservatism. The 
beauty of which justifies growing dis­
parities in standards of living on the 
grounds that appeals to economic de­
mocracy can only mean one thing — 
political tyranny.
Notwithstanding his habitual confu­
sion of economic and political democ­
racy, Singhal never explains why the 
virtuous “free market” has concentrated 
more than half this country’s wealth 
into the hands of one percent of its popu­
lation — a fact he seeks to justify by 
claiming that “the rich are often the 
ones that create jobs by opening small 
businesses and using their capital to 
hire more workers.” Of course, as any 
student of labor history knows, the “cre­
ation of jobs” has its flipside in the de­
struction and degradation of jobs, while 
both processes are merely a corollary to 
the fundamental self-serving priority of 
corporate capital accumulation. True to 
form, the corporate-led abandonment of 
the durable goods/heavy industries in 
the U.S. since the early ’60s, and the 
subsequent rise of real-estate, banking, 
and business sectors have resulted in 
dramatic increases in the number of 
anti-union, low-wage, service-industry 
jobs which have outnumbered goods- 
production employment by a 10-to-one 
margin over the past 25 years. Likewise, 
the class-stratified U.S. health-care sys­
tem admirably reflects similar priori­
ties of corporate privatization with its 
attendant income/skill polarization: at 
the top, a half a million of the highest 
paid dentists and doctors in the world, 
below them a million and a half nurses 
(the lowest paid among college/graduate 
professionals), and below them over three 
million low-wage, blue-collar, and cleri­
cal workers.
Singhal claims that “to equalize the 
standard of living among all Americans 
...will eventually produce a negative in­
centive for people to work.” Accepting 
the assumptions behind this dubious 
framework (which no US administra­
tion has ever even remotely considered), 
we find two problems. First, for many 
there already exists little incentive to 
work; the majority of occupations for 
which most Americans rent their labor 
to survive provides little chance for ad­
vancement, offers nominal payment, 
dreary workplaces, and in many cases, 
are degrading and monotonous. Second, 
the vast majority of wealth generated in 
the U.S. (70 percent in the ’80s) accrues 
to the upper one percent of the popula­
tion, all of whom do little actual “work,” 
certainly nothing in proportion to the 
enormous rewards they reap.
Singhal’s fears that nationalization of 
health industries will lead us down the 
slippery slope of socialism disguises the 
fact that the U.S. already practices so­
cialism for the rich. Like the industries 
of military production, which rely upon 
a state-led mechanism by which citizens 
are compelled to provide a subsidy to 
high technology industry, the U.S. gov­
ernment uses income taxes to subsidize 
tobacco, pharmaceutical, chemical, and 
agricultural big business, to name a few.
I would suggest that in the future, 
before resorting to the well-worn clichés 
of the “virtuous free market” and the 
“evils of communism,” Singhal actually 
learn something about the history of 
state-corporate power and its relations 
to American capitalism.

Those natural predators which were

they were dangerous to humans.
It is apparent that Ball has no under­

He seems to have lost touch with reality 
in his fervent desire to have everyone 
stop eating meat. He has gone so far as 
to disconnect himself from rational ar­

Sit-ins were not rational
columns or editorials, no matter how 
much I disagree with them, but last 
week’s column [“NRA members have 
penis envy,” 9/27] was just too ludicrous, 
incoherent, and obnoxious to pass me 
by.
I don’t find anything worth address­
ing, much less commenting on, in the 
first two paragraphs (for they are merely 
ad hominem attacks on gun owners) 
except to say that there are actually 
many thousands of female NRA. mem­
bers. This is due to an understanding 
that self-defense is an especially impor­
tant concern for women, and guns are a 
practical means to this end.
Ball’s paragraph on the NRA’s “legis­
lative agenda” shows nothing but igno­
rance and malice. Semi-automatic rifles 
do have valid sporting uses, and if one 
actually looked at the statistics, such 
weapons (even those rare fully auto ver­
sions, which are illegal without a special 
federal permit) are used in an insignifi­
cant percentage of crimes involving guns 
anyway. In fact all types rifles, semi­
automatic or non, contributed to about 
five percent of all gun crimes (from FBI 
crime stats 1987). The NRA supported 
legislation 10 years ago which outlawed 
sales of such ammunition.
I will skip the remainder of the author’s 
babble and address his claims that all 
the violence among youth is gun-caused. 
This violence you mention is being com­
mitted by illegal guns anyway, so what 
good will gun control do — make it more 
illegal? In any case, the author hasn’t 
quite refuted the “guns don’t kill people, 
people kill people;” he has merely side­
stepped it. I would actually put forth a 
quote I prefer — “If guns cause crime, 
matches cause arson.”
You claim to not know anyone who has 
purchased a gun for self defense. This 
surprises me, for I know many. In fact, I 
am one of these people. I find the level of 
violence on the streets of cities these day 
quite frightening, and the police do not 
have the resources to deal with all of it.
Now we have come to the real topic of 
your vexation — hunters. It would ap­

right places, I believe they may not be 
rationally analyzing the situation nor 
thinking about the true consequences of 
their actions. j
Obviously, some students have been

we will have to “pay” for this either 
through increased tuition or by library 
cutbacks in other services. The money, 
saved by reducing hours could instead 
be used to support other needs, such as 
increased purchases of books, journals, 
and other reference materials.
If the library must cut expenses, it 
seems to me that cutting late-night li^

who would have done their research at 2

rather stick with the reduced hours if it 
meant I could actually find some useful*

If somehow the longer hours can be

SafeWalk initiation
deserves accolade
After the first rape occurred 
on Frew Street at the start of 
last semester, Kevin Bronke and 
Student Government President 
Dave Wolpert sat down to dis­
cuss what they could do to make 
this campus a safer place. Their 
solution was SafeWalk—a pro­
gram where students could be 
escorted around campus late at 
night.
Starting tonight, SafeWalk 
will become a reality.
We applaud the efforts of ev­
eryone who worked to create 
SafeWalk.
We’re sure that it will increase 
the level of safety on campus 
and will help keep people more 
secure when they want to walk 
from one place on campus to 
another late at night.
One aspect of the formation of 
SafeWalk which we find very 
impressive is the involvement 
of Student Government and 
other departments.
Though Student Government 
Presidents of the last few years 
have been relatively inactive, 
Wolpert’s level of activity has 
been high since before his elec­
tion. One of his campaign 
pledges was that he would ini­
tiate the SafeWalk program. We 
are pleased and reassured to 
see that he has come through 
with his promise.
We’re also glad to see that 
many departments, from Stu­
dent Affairs to Security, came 
together to help start SafeWalk.
We’re also glad that so much 
thought has gone into the 
SafeWalk program. Each escort 
will have a recognizable uni­
form and an ID displayed so 
that they can be easily identi­
fied.
The only suggestion we have 
is that SafeWalk actually pro­
vide its escorters with SafeW alk 
ID cards instead of just using 
their student IDs.
Also, freshmen cannot be es­
corts. This is a good idea be­
cause freshman are not as used 
to the college environment or as 
familiar with the Carnegie 
Mellon campus as other stu­
dents.
On a campus not normally 
known for it s student involve­
ment, it is heartening to see 24 
people volunteer for SafeWalk.
Unfortunately, the maj ority of 
people volunteering are male. 
The original plan for SafeWalk 
was to have one male and one 
female escort, so that the people 
being escorted would feel more 
comfortable. Since there are not 
enough female volunteers, there 
will be escort teams with only 
males.
We encourage more people, 
especially women, to join the 
SafeWalk program.
Right now, the hours for 
SafeWalk will be from 10 pm to
2 am. These are good initial 
starting and ending times.
If SafeWalk gets a lot of usage, 
the hours may be extended to 9 
pm to 3 am. We hope enough 
people will take advantage of 
SafeWalk so that the program 
will thrive.
If you are going from one end 
of campus to another and do not 
feel safe, give SafeWalk a call. 
Their number is x8-SAFE.
Poor ranking reflects 
internal problems
Last week we reported on 
CMU’s drop in rank according 
to US News and World Report.
While we think that this is 
unfortunate, we don’t feel that 
the school should worry about 
falling from 19 to 24 in the 
rankings.
However, we do feel that the 
school should concentrate on 
improving the campus for the 
students.
For instance, there are some 
departments at CMU that con­
sistently treat their students 
poorly.
These departments either 
don’t care, are too concerned 
with research, or are so caught 
up in their own bureaucracies 
that the students are forgotten. 
By no means are we trying to 
insinuate that students are 
treated poorly in every depart­
ment, but when they are, the 
treatment is stunningly poor.
Poor treatment of students is 
not the only problem here at 
CMU. There are many other 
concerns — especially campus 
facilities and services.
We all know that our athletic 
facilities need a considerable 
amount of work. Our gym is 
worse than most universities, 
including our Division III ri­
vals.
Dining Services is another de­
partment that seems to think 
that it should confuse students
as much as possible. They open 
and close dining facilities with 
no apparent rhyme or reason, 
rarely even consulting students 
as to what course of action the 
student body might prefer. Is it 
too much to ask to be told where 
we are going to be able to dine 
and why it keeps changing?
The new university center is 
yet another source of confusion. 
When shall this so far theoreti­
cal building come into existence? 
And for that matter, when will 
Skibo be coming down? Students 
now make their way through 
the building ready to sprint out 
should the administration de­
cide to tear it down at that mo­
ment. It is unfair to keep stu­
dents in limbo as to what is 
happening to the building that 
is supposedly central to their 
campus life.
In all, the most important 
thing that the administration 
must realize is that worrying 
about and working to thwart 
such allegedly tangible threats 
to CMU’s standing as the US 
News ranking will mean noth­
ing as long as there remains a 
visible lack of concern for the 
currently enrolled students. 
Though the ranking is certainly 
important in some way, it is in 
no way relevant to the currently 
poor relationship between the 
University hierarchy and most 
of the student body.

American nationalism must not stop NAFTAFear of losing U.S. jobs threatens chance at economic recovery
Matt Ball
During the Gulf War, I took 
part in protests against our in­
volvement, in part because re­
turning the Emir to his solid-gold 
toilet seat wasn’t worth killing or 
dying for. My best pal was living 
overseas at the time, where she 
took part in demonstrations as 
well.
“How could you protest the 
United States while in another 
country?” she was asked after 
she returned. “Aren’t you proud 
to be an American?!”
To me, this is a bizarre and 
absurd statement. Asking some­
one if they take pride in being a 
citizen of the country in which 
they were born is like asking if 
someone is proud to be white or 
male or tall. How can a charac­
teristic conferred randomly upon 
an individual be a reason for ego­
ism?
All women and men are not
created equal. We are bom with 
different physical characteristics, 
different mental abilities, and dif­
ferent sociological circumstances. 
Some of us are bom poor and 
handicapped, while others are 
bom rich and talented. Some of 
us had ancestors who were Na­
zis, others of us had ancestors 
who were slaves.
The circumstances of our con­
ception and birth are not a mea­
sure of who we are as a person, 
nor must they determine our fu­
ture decisions or actions.
Yet we cling to these unchosen 
characteristics. We yeam to feel 
important and exalted, to show 
why we are the chosen, superior 
being. We cling to any difference 
that can set us apart from and, in 
our narrow and conceited minds, 
above others.
We continually divide the world 
by random and impertinent traits 
into ever decreasing circles of in­
creasing similarity. Each progres­
sive outer circle is less worthy 
and more despicable. Each con­
secutively closer circle is more 
virtuous and less disparaged.

life.
Thousands live desperate, ter- 
ror-filled lives in the war zones of

of Disney World, crime becomes a 
tragedy.

We jealously guard our divine

A person in Mexico, to whom a

It is striking to watch what 
people bom to other conditions 
will endure just for the chance of 
an opportunity in the United 
States.
NAFTA would not blindly suck 
jobs away from U.S. citizens. 
Rather, it would grant more 
Americans, from north and south 
of the Rio Grande, the chance to 
bid on work.
Equality of opportunity should 
be the rule for all, regardless of 
the location of their birth.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I am disappointed that 
your newspaper sees fit 
to publish immature 
slander against a proud 
American organization 
celebrating its 123rd anniversary. The col­
umn by Matt Ball [“NRA members have penis 
envy,” 9/27], besides being an insult to the 
over 3.1 million men and women who make up 
the National Rifle Association, contains many 
errors of fact and misleading statements.
Ball states that he’s “... never seen a woman 
passionately defending the second amend­
ment.” Well then I suppose he’s never heard of 
Dr. Suzanna Gratia who campaigns in Texas 
and around the country for sensible laws that 
would allow law abiding citizens to carry 
!| firearms for their protection. Both of her par­
ents were killed while she watched helplessly, 
because Texas law demanded that she leave 
her handgun in her car and not keep it with 
her. Nor has he heard of Paxton Quigley, 
author of Armed and Female. Quigley was 
^),once a supporter of the gun control lobby but 
now writes about personal protection issues 
for women and fights to preserve these 
women’s rights to protect themselves with 
firearms. And of course there are the 12 women 
on the NRA board of directors and the 30 
women holding high level management posi­
tions in the NRA, not to mention the thou­
sands of female NRA members.
Later, Ball implies that fighting for second 
amendment freedoms is the domain of “white 
males.” This is in contrast to the beliefs of 
Roy Innis, NRA board member and national 
chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality 
(CORE). Innis has pointed out how gun con­
trol in the U.S. has its roots in racism and the 
fear of newly freed blacks after the Civil War. 
Other authors also point to gun control laws 
enacted in the 1960s to curb that period’s 
civil rights movement.
If I can pick out actual “points” that Ball is 
trying to make, it seems that he believes that 
gun ownership is driven by “phallo-centric” 
reasons and that self-defense is not a valid 
reason to own a gun. But criminologists at 
Florida State University have found that 
handguns are more often used by victims to 
defeat crime than by criminals to commit it. 
No, this has nothing to do with men or their 
genitals; just look at Orlando, Florida in the 
late 1960s. The female populace was plagued 
with a series of brutal assaults, but just the 
publicity of the record number of women 
buying guns and obtaining training in how to 
use them resulted in an 88 percent decrease 
in rape for that area, the only city of its size 
in the country to experience a decrease of 
crime for that year. And in the U.S. as a 
whole, between 1983 and 1986, gun owner­
ship among women increased 53 percent to 
over 12 million female gun owners.
So perhaps The Tartan could print a posi­
tive article about the NRA’s women’s pro­
grams, hunter services, or about their de­
fense of the U.S. Constitution. If not, you 
could always write about NRA programs in 
firearms safety, firearms training, law en­
forcement training, as well as their junior 
shooting activities, competitions, or gun col­
lecting activities. The NRA has a lot to offer 
for people interested in firearms, or for Ameri­
cans just interested in preserving their free­
dom.

Once again, President Bill Clinton 
is trying to make one of his campaign 
promises become reality. He is at­
tempting to reform the health care 
system so every American can have 
the right to affordable health care.
Currently, an unemployed Ameri­
can, who no longer has a health care 
plan through work, is forced to pay at 
least $4,000 per year for minimal 
health care coverage for their 
families. Thirty-seven million Ameri­
cans simply cannot afford this much, 
even to guarantee their health and 
the health of their loved ones.
Under the new plan, every citizen 
would be guaranteed health care and 
would be given the choice between 
three different plans with varying 
prices and degrees of coverage. People 
would no longer be considered indi­
viduals in the new system. Instead 
they would become part of a pool of 
people who are all covered by a par­
ticular plan.
Clinton hopes that the new system 
will level off the cost of health care so 
that it does not continue to grow at 
such an extraordinary rate. However, 
if the costs did not level off as ex­
pected, the government would have 
the right to freeze cost growth. Pre­
mium health care insurance would 
still be available to those who want it, 
but since it is not necessary, the gov­
ernment would no longer consider the 
extra money that is spent on these 
plans exempt from income tax. As far 
as care is concerned, it would be al­
most the same. One of the only major 
differences is that the patient must 
see a general practitioner before going 
to an expensive specialist. The 
patient can still be referred to a spe­
cialist but that is after the general
practitioner realizes that the problem 
requires a specialist.
Many people would like to know 
where the money is going to come from 
to pay for health care for the unem­
ployed. It will come from the elimina­
tion of Medicare and a variety of cost 
cuts, taxes, and efficiency upgrades. 
Eliminating Medicare alone will save 
the government over $100 billion.
The government will cut costs in the 
health care services by using preven­
tion services. Many people who are not 
covered by a health plan do not go to the 
hospital until they are near death. These 
trips to the emergency room are much 
more expensive than the regular doctor 
visits that might have prevented the 
problem. Since the care given in the 
emergency room is rarely paid for by 
such patients, the hospitals increase 
other prices to compensate. This in­
creases the cost of health care for every­
one.
Taxes will be placed on products, such 
as cigarettes and alcohol, that lead to 
health problems. This could discourage 
purchasing such products and poten­
tially lower the cost of health care be­
cause people would consume less of the 
products and therefore have less costly 
health problems.
The efficiency of the entire health 
care system would be improved by re­
ducing the required paperwork for doc­
tors. All of the patients’ identification 
numbers would be on their health care 
card, and the doctors would have to 
make only one copy of patient informa­
tion rather that the many copies re­
quired by the current system.
I have heard many arguments why 
the new health care system should not 
be implemented, but very few of them 
seem to have a solid base. For example, 
some critics claim that the new system 
will put bureaucrats in charge of health 
care.
Although this may be true, who do 
they think is in charge of the system 
now? It is the medical system’s bureau-

Term limits offer no remedy for CongressAnswer lies in public’s ability to vote, not in limiting political service
Ronak Singhal
This week, Senator Donald 
Riegle (D-Mi.) announced that he 
. would not seek another term in 
; office. This came just weeks after 
; Senators David Durenburger (R- 
:. Mn.) and Dennis DeConcini (D-
• Az.) made similar announce- 
‘ ments. All three cited wanting 
; more time with their families as 
) a reason why they decided to re- 
) tire, but another thing that they 
\ all had in common was that they
• had all been investigated for vari- 
' ous forms of corrupt behavior.
; DeConcini and Riegle were two of 
; the infamous Keating Five, while 
•; it is widely assumed that Duren- 
;; berger will soon find himself in 
•. jail for his own little scandal.
What does this type of behavior 
j •: say about the status of our 
j nation’s governing body? Many 
; people say that it is this type of 
j behavior that warrants the need 
! for term limits — limits which 
\ • supporters say will stop people
from becoming career politicians, 
forgetting what is like in the real 
world and also not having enough 
time to be in Washington to be­
come corrupt.
I, on the other hand, totally 
disagree with the notion that term 
limits will stop corruption, nor do 
I believe that term limits should 
be implemented. But so many 
people in America, including poli­
ticians and would-be politicians 
like Ross Perot, support term lim­
its. Why would I be against what 
seems like a logical step to fixing 
Congress?
I believe that the best way to fix 
Congress already exists. It’s 
known as the ballot. The oppor­
tunity for the public to decide 
who represents them is a funda­
mental belief upon which our gov­
ernment is set, and setting an 
artificial amount of time that 
these representatives can serve 
will only hurt the people.
The three senators who have 
decided to retire have done so 
mainly because the public will 
not elect them next fall.
If this were not the case, then 
why were both parties somewhat
happy to see their own members 
retire from Congress?
How would you feel if the per­
son who represents you in Con­
gress had to be replaced, because 
he had served too long, not be­
cause he didn’t represent the 
views of his constituents or be­
cause he was a corrupt politician.
Again, people 
will be arguing 
that new blood 
is good in Con­
gress. I will 
agree with 
them, but I say 
let the people 
choose who 
loses their
seats, don’t let the calendar de­
cide.
The problem is not allowing 
new blood in. It’s why should we 
force the old blood out. If a person 
is doing a job and they are doing 
it well, should they not be al­
lowed to maintain their position?
In other words, should they be 
forced to leave their job because 
of time, not ability? Of course not, 
but admittedly the number of 
people in Congress currently that
seem to be doing competent jobs Congressmen serving for many 
is very low. years is not new. Just look at how

gards to the political implications 
of the investigation.
This year, some members of 
the House wished to release the 
papers involving the House Post 
Office Scandal to the public, yet 
the move was blocked by Demo­
crats.
Many have concluded that this 
was done to protect their own, 
especially the most powerful 
members in the House.
Just last year, we witnessed 
the biggest turnover in Congress 
in the last 50 years.
This change occurred without 
the help of a law or Constitu- 
tional amendment. The change 
occurred because the people de­
manded change through the most 
powerful tool that they hold -— 
their vote.
To enact term limits would be 
to blunt this tool and weaken one 
of the pillars upon which our 
country’s government was 
founded.

Changing corporate climate demands new labor relations
David Hunt
Several years ago, I lived in Maine, having taken 
‘ a year off from school. After painting houses for the 
summer, I was laidoff and had to find another job. 
UPS would have been ideal— good pay, hours, and 
benefits. At the orientation, I was told that I had to 
‘join the Teamsters Union. As I recall, monthly 
dues were on the order of $20, and the initiation fee 
was in the hundreds. At the end of the session, I 
walked out thinking that this really was extortion.
Later that year, I moved to Orlando. Unlike 
Maine, Florida is a “right to work” state, where 
unions cannot require people to be members in 
order to work. At the company where I worked, the 
United Auto Workers (UAW) was the one to join. 
The fees were much more reasonable: a few dollars 
a month and maybe $15 as the initiation fee. I 
eventually joined. Among the benefits I got was a 
fair amount of “pull” should I get laidoff. I was led 
to believe that the union would fight for my job.
I was wrong. Five months after starting, I was 
laidoff. I asked the union shop steward to at least 
do me the favor of finding out the rationale behind 
the layoffs, as the plating shop I was in had more 
than enough work to carry myself and the other 
person being laidoff. The steward said he couldn’t 
do anything. I called the union and asked what 
they could do to save my job, which turned out to be 
nothing. I then asked if I could at least find out why 
the layoffs were occurring, and they wouldn’t even 
type a letter on my behalf. Only because I hap­
pened to “know someone” did I find out the layoff 
rationale.
And it was only because of this same someone 
that I got rehired. The union didn’t do jack shit for 
me. Needless to say, I didn’t renew my member­
ship.
In the early history of the unions, they were 
vitally necessary, because bosses viewed laborers 
as machines to be exploited. Worker organization 
was the only way to effectively fight back. Over the 
years, unions have been instrumental in raising 
wages, getting benefits, and helping to make the 
workplace safer. There can be no question that
freely acknowledge that mining is phenomenally 
dangerous and difficult labor. But it does the work­
ers no good if the company they are striking against 
goes out of business, because non-union competi­
tors steal all the customers away. Each side is 
blaming the other, and, from what I’ve heard, the 
union representatives are refusing to even speak 
to the companies involved. Everyone loses in the 
long run if these companies die because of the 
strike.
Fortunately some changes are taking place. GM 
and the UAW have a revolutionary agreement in 
the Saturn division. Workers are much more in-
Unions should not coerce people into joining. Managers 
must realize that employee morale and dedication mean 
far more to productivity than head counts save in cost. 
AT&T and Saturn are are just two of the U.S. companies 
trying to reinvent the sense of corporate family.
unions have played a vital role in making employ­
ment, especially blue-collar employment, much 
better than in the past.
Unions and “management” have traditionally 
been at odds, each striving to screw the other. The 
bosses of the company would try to cut wages or at 
least raise them as little as possible. Worker safety 
was a hard-won victory for the unions. But both 
sides are to blame for the decades-old antagonism.
Look at the current mine workers strike. I will
volved in decisions at management and engineer­
ing levels. Blue- and white-collar workers work 
together to design and make a world-class product, 
and they are succeeding. Once I leave CMU, I 
intend to buy a Saturn, partly because of this new 
philosophy.
A recent speaker at a mechanical engineering 
seminar talked about AT&T’s new corporate cul­
ture, and how they are trying to create a sense of 
corporate “family.” The irony is that this used to be
the case—whole families would work for the same 
company. Grunts would become machinists, and 
then supervisors, and move upwards. There was a 
real sense of company spirit, until the managers; 
and accountants started viewing everyone on the 
factory floor as nothing more than interchangeable 
amounts of work output.
A great deal of complaints have been voiced 
about the predatory techniques of the Japanese. 
There certainly is some truth to the fact that the 
Japanese have many barriers to U.S. product pen­
etration. But part of the reason the Japanese have 
been so successful is this real sense of corporate 
“family” that pervades their industry. Workers 
and supervisors critique each other. Suggestions 
flow from workers at a phenomenal rate, because 
they know their suggestions will be taken seri­
ously.
Until recently, large-scale layoffs in Japan were 
unheard of, because employees are family. This 
spirit played a great role in Japan becoming a 
world-class industrial nation.
Unions should not coerce people into joining. 
Managers must realize that employee morale and 
dedication mean far more to productivity than 
head counts save in cost.
AT&T and Saturn are just two of the U.S. compa­
nies trying to reinvent the sense of corporate fam-; 
ily. Management and unions must put aside their 
differences and work towards the common goal of 
corporate success. Only if this trend continues will 
American industry regain its strength.

Health care reform needed
HEALTH, from page 7
cracy that is calling all of the shots and 
declaring the prices. At least under 
the new plan the group in charge would 
be trying to help, instead of bleeding 
you dry.
I have heard critics claim that health 
care should be taken away if, for ex­
ample, someone had trouble with the 
IRS.
If that critic had been around when 
social security was beginning, they 
probably would have said the same 
thing. Health care would be an entitle­
ment, just like social security, so it 
could not be taken away.
Finally, I have heard complaints that 
the new plan would make it difficult to 
obtain a health care plan for a higher 
level of care. Although people wanting 
such plans would be taxed a little bit 
more, they could still maintain their 
level of health insurance.
Afterall, such plans are partly re­
sponsible for the current problem of 
cost inflation, because they pay for 
much more coverage than is really 
needed.
People often have testa performed 
that are absolutely unnecessary. 
Afterall, they are completely covered 
by their plan, so why not have it done?
Do not misunderstand the new plan 
either. It will pay at least part, de­
pending on your plan, for such tests— 
as long as your doctor believes it is 
necessary.
This eliminates a lot of wasted time
and money.
If you want the bottom line, then 
yes, you might end up paying a little 
bit more for your health care in the 
short run.
In the long run, however, the level­
ing offofprices will benefit the middle 
class, whose cost of insurance will not 
be increasing nearly as fast.
My question to you is, “What kind of 
world do you want to live in?” Do you 
want it to be a world where the have- 
nots are not even allowed to be cared 
for when they are sick?
Take, for example, the service work­
ers at Carnegie Mellon. They are there 
every day making sure that your cam­
pus life is a little more pleasant, but 
how can anyone expect them to pur­
chase health care for $4,000 per year 
on what they make per hour?
They are not lazy or unmotivated, 
and they deserve the basic right to 
health care regardless of their finan­
cial status.
I realize that it is very easy to look 
out for yourself and not care about 
others, but that is not the type ofworld 
that I want to live in.
Years from now, when I look at my 
country, I don’t want to see sickness 
and death and know that it remains 
because I pinched a few pennies.

U.S. must rethink foreign policy now
^^^^^^^DavU£chwartz
From 1945 until 1990, US foreign 
policy was rooted in one clear objective
— containment of an ominous Commu­
nist “menace” that emanated from what 
was once the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics. In that time, the Cold War, a 
war of political, military and economic 
might, shaped US foreign policy. The 
result we see now attests to our having 
won this war. That threat has now dis­
appeared. Unfortunately, U.S. foreign 
policy now seems purposeless and aim­
less, and at a time when quite the oppo­
site should be the case. We are with­
drawing ourselves from global affairs 
when such a course is unwise. Yes we 
won the Cold War, but that does not 
mean the U.S. can afford to disengage 
itself from global affairs. Dangers to the 
global community are now even more 
perilous than during the Cold War.
The threats to U.S. and global security 
are relatively amorphous ones that can’t 
be dealt with by implementation of a 
singularly oriented policy. The U.S. opted 
to “contain” the Soviet Union, and that 
proved highly effective. However, what 
type of policy will sufficiently address 
the serious issues of our day, such as 
terrorism, civil war, nuclear weapon 
proliferation by former Soviet republics, 
narcotics trafficking, civil strife in So­
malia, and the spread of Islamic funda­
mentalism. During the Cold War, many 
of these problems were, to some degree, 
effectively kept under control. Now, 
Pandora’sBox has been opened.
The answer to these problems seems 
to be multilateralism and consensus 
building among nations. But what has 
become of the dispersion of U.S. leader­
ship and power among other nations? 
Has this proven successful? One need 
only look at the massive blood-letting in 
the former Yugoslavia, the ineptitude 
that has marked European Community 
(E.C.) decision-making, and U.N. activ­
ity in ending the conflagration. Once 
again, the U.S. has been called upon to 
provide the leadership through NATO 
that might lead to the deployment of 
25,000 U.S. troops, should the warring 
factions agree to a cease-fire and truce.
If one turns to Somalia, one sees a 
similar fiasco in the making. The matter 
of Somalia will, in the end, prove a com­
plete failure once U.N. forces withdraw 
and the state of lawlessness returns. 
More time bombs are just waiting to 
explode in other areas of the world and, 
should the U.S. continue to disengage 
itself from its former Cold War alliances 
while implementing haphazard policies 
in tandem, don’t be surprised if we are 
forced to participate in yet another glo­
bal conflict.
As for multilateralism, the idea is a 
practical and realistic one. It’s short­
comings have more to do with the way it 
has been interpreted. The key missing 
elementis U.S. leadership. International
institutions and regional alliances are 
not yet ready to have the leadership role 
consigned to nations with immature lead­
ership. The U.S. must continue to play 
the role of global leader, with a gradu­
ally diminishing role as other nations 
mature andbecome capable of assuming 
leadership. For example, NATO should 
continue to function under U.S. leader­
ship until the E.C. and its constituent 
members can fill NATOs role. Also, the 
inclusion of Japan and Germany into 
the U.N. Security Council will assuredly, 
accelerate the maturity process that is1 
definitely lacking within these economi­
cally powerful nations.
On the U.S. side, we must fight the 
tendency towards nationalism, protec­
tionism, and isolationism. Those who 
feel the U.S. cannot deal with domestic1 
and foreign issues concurrently are quite 
misguided. It is their argument that the 
U.S. would only become a global police­
man; however, we are not the only na­
tion on Earth that desires peace and 
stability.
We must keep in mind that our inter­
ests will increasingly reside abroad and 
that global stability is a prerequisite for 
us to be able to prosper. Should we fail 
to see the warning signs now, let us turn 
the clock back 54 years and see what can! 
happen when we choose to ignore our 
world. Must we subject ourselves to the 
repetition of history?

Dee completed only nine of 27 
passes, hitting senior wide re­
ceiver Jarrod Siket twice for 38 
yards and sophomore tight end
beat them, but we lost to them in the end. We beat 
ourselves.”
“Dee is a great player and leader. We moved'tiie 
ball well. The game is a matter of inches,” said 
Erdelyi.
“The ball was slick; it was harder to throw apd 
Fred to kick. The loss was a minor breakdown, but 
we can’t be disappointed and can’t blame any one 
person,” said Grusky. _
Despite Dee’s weak numbers, he moved into 
fourth place on the school’s all time passing list, 
passing Bill Kiselick (2,823 yards, 1979-198$). 
Dee now has 2,895 passing yards from 1990-1$$3.
The loss will make the realization of the playoffs 
a little harder to attain, but should not knock CMU 
out of playoff contention. •
“We are going to win the rest of our games, gtrto 
the playoffs, and kick Allegheny’s ass in the play­
offs,” said Burton.
One highlight out of the loss was that CMU 
extended its Division III scoring record to ¿00 
consecutive games. The all-division record is held 
by UCLA which scored in 246 consecutive garties. 
The Tartans have now won 20 out of their last.'£4 
games.
The Tartans are home again next week against 
the Trinity University Tigers from Texas for;a 
1:30pm kickoff. The Tigers are looking to avenge 
last year’s 42—17 loss to CMU in Texas.
Saturday’s game against Allegheny marked tlje 
halfway point for the Tartans. After battling ttye 
Tigers at Gesling Stadium this Saturday, tlje 
team will travel to the windy city to take on.ttfe 
University of Chicago.
The team then enjoys a bye week before taking 
on Grove City College on Saturday, October 30. j
November kicks off with a home night ganje 
against Catholic University. Gametime is 7:30pi$.
The Tartans finish out the season against Ca^e 
Western Reserve University in their last UAjA. 
match of the season. The playoffs begin shortly 
after this.

Both Tartan soccer teams fall to Emory UniversityMen lose first game of the season
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
In a flurry of passes puntuated 
with a sharp kick, the CMU men’s 
soccer team’s unbeaten season 
came to an end. Emory Univer­
sity scored twice _____________
in four minutes in 
a 2-0 victory that 
brought CMU’s 
seven game win­
ning streak this 
season to a close.
In the 71st 
minute of play, the 
Eagles made a se­
ries of crisp passes 
that ended with 
freshman James 
Doran finding se­
nior John Riofrio 
who beat CMU 
senior goalkeeper 
Dave Shapiro low 
to the far post. Three minutes 
and 15 seconds later, Emory drove 
¿own field four on three. Fresh­
man Billy Eddy was stopped by 
senior co-captain John Stivoric, 
but when Stivoric couldn’t clear 
the ball Eddy’s cross was bicycle- 
kicked in by Doran.
Carnegie Mellon pressed the 
offensive for the remaining 15 
minutes but could not get past 
junior Brian Smith, the goalie 
who made five saves. Shapiro, 
who allowed more goals in the 
game than he has all season, made
four saves.
“It was a good game for both 
teams,” saidGaudioso. “I thought 
one goal would make the differ­
ence. Give them credit, they 
played well. They took us out of 
our game plan.”
"I thought one goal would 
make the difference. Give 
them credit, they played well. 
They took us out of our game 
plan."
— Nick Gaudioso
The injury bug that Gaudioso 
tried to avoid finally caught up 
with the Tartans. With freshman 
midfielder Tom Layton (possibly 
out for the season with a serious 
knee injury), and junior 
midfielder Pat Lucignani play­
ing at less than 100 percent with 
a knee injury of his own, the Tar­
tan midfield struggled at times.
“Everybody played decently. 
We made one little marking mis­
take, and that cost us,” said 
Gaudioso.
Gaudioso said he was not con­
cerned with his team’s perfor­
mance. “Everything stays the 
same for us. We just have to get 
healthy. We’ll see what happens. 
I’m more worried about the other 
teams coming up.” On Wednes­
day, the Tartans are home against 
___________ Westminster Col­
lege and Saturday 
they travel to 
Franklin & Mar­
shall College.
The Tartans and 
the Eagles fought 
back and forth for 
most of the game 
with neither team 
able to score before 
Riofrio’s goal.
“I don’t really 
know what went 
wrong,” said senior 
co-captain Min 
Chong.
“They did things 
right, andwe weren’tplayingwith 
our heads. I’m sorry, I don’t know 
what to say. I don’t feel really 
good about the game.”
Their record is now 7-1-0 on 
the season, 3-1-0 in the UAA.
On Saturday, the team defeated 
the New York University Violets 
2-0.
Shapiro earned the shutout, his 
fourth of the season. Sophomore 
Allan Levin scored in the first 
minute of play, and Stivoric added 
a goal on a header on a pass from 
junior Vince Russell.

Women lose 2-0 despite great effort
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The CMU women’s soccer team is still learning 
what they need to do in UAA competition. Sunday’s 
2-0 loss to the Eagles of Emory University was a 
step in the right direction everywhere but on the 
scoreboard.
The Tartan offense looked good, but squandered 
its scoring opportunities. The defense also played 
very well, but its two letdowns cost them.“We knew 
it was going to be a tough game,” said junior Kathi 
Watson. “We came out hard and did our best 
against a really tough team. We are improving 
every game.”
In the first half of the game, the two teams 
battled back and forth with neither able to score. 
The CMU offense, based around long kicks to fleet 
sophomore forward Nicole Poisson, had a number
of scoring opportunities, but the _______________
Emory defense and senior goal­
keeper Beth Brock came up big.
Meanwhile, the Eagles offense 
was controlled by the Tartan de­
fense with senior sweeper Anh 
Nguyen and junior defender 
Christina Isaly leading the way.
Freshman goalie Jill Weber made 
the big save when she had to; she 
made nine saves facing 21 shots.
“Jill Weber was more aggressive 
and improved. She made some 
pivotable saves, some key saves. She made the 
difficult saves look easy, and that’s not easy to do,” 
said head coach Julie Shackford.
Michael Sabatelle, Emory coach told Weber after 
the game, “You are the best goalkeeper we have 
seen so far.”
The strong Emory team may have been looking 
past the Tartans but after the half, they began to 
turn up the pressure. Under the hot sun in Atlanta, 
the Eagles slowly took control in the second half.
In the 57th minute of the game, after a foul on 
Tartan freshman Mae Hogan, sophomore Diana 
Spock’s free kick was headed by freshman 
midfielder Skye Hardin to sophomore Amy Smith 
who beat Weber low for what proved to be the 
winning goal.
.. We knew it 
was going to be 
a tough game ”
— Kathi Watson
A turning point in the game came with about 64 
minutes gone. CMU freshman Jill Sincaglia arched 
a shot high over Brock. The ball appeared to break 
the plane of the goal, but Brock pulled it out while 
still in the air, and referee Mike Balson called it no 
goal.
Emory sealed the game with a late goal in the 
last three minutes. Junior Melissa Eagan scored 
on an assist from Smith.
After the game Shackford was optimistic in her 
assessment of the Tartan’s effort.
“Playing in 80-degree heat on the road wag 
definitely a factor. I’m definitely not disappointed; 
We came out really strong. The first half was pretty 
even, and I thought that was real good. In the 
second half, Emory came out a little stronger, 
thought it was a well fought game. We had our 
chances and it showed a much improved team. We 
had a couple of nice chances and the kids played
_______________ real hard.” She also praised her
players. “Kathi Watson played 
great as a marking back. Alyssa 
Newman [a freshman midfielder] 
works hard between their stop, 
per and sweeper. Nicole Poisson 
[sophomore] showed definite im- 
provement. She realized she could 
use her speed. Kristen Rathbun 
[freshman defender] came off the 
bench and did a real strong de- 
fensive effort.”
Senior co-captain Rachel 
Bourn said, “This let us know we can play with 
teams of that level. We’re going to know what to 
expect out of the league after this.” Other players 
agreed with Bourn. “We really rose to the occasion; 
You want to talk about marking? Everybody stayed 
on their man. This game is going to give us more 
confidence,” said Poisson.
The Tartans fall to 5-2-1 (1-2-0 in the UAA),; 
Emory is now 7-2-1 overall, and 3-0-1 in the UAA.
One of Emory’s wins was over Case Western, 
who is the only other team to beat CMU. Emory 
tied the University of Rochester who is nationally 
ranked.
On Wednesday, the Tartans travel to Washing­
ton & Jefferson College to take on the Diplomats; 
The team then travels to Marymount University;

Parcells, Seifert are overrated coaches
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
Of the 28 coaches in the NFL, no one is 
more overrated than Bill Parcells. With 
his incredible ego and a single year of 
broadcast experience, he started coach­
ing the New England Patriots this year. 
However, despite his 0-4 start, the press 
won’t quit talking about him. Even when 
the 0-2 Seahawks played his team in 
the battle of two winless teams, the 
game was made out to be a playoff game. 
Hot once did I see Tom Flores, the coach 
of the Seahawks, during the highlights, 
but there was Parcell’s face on the screen 
after every score. Parcells was a good 
coach with the N.Y. Giants,not a great 
one. He won two Super Bowls with the 
Giants and made them a top team in the 
80s. However, in ’93, he is lost without
his right-hand man Ron Erhardt. With 
the Steelers (like with the Giants of the 
80s), Erhardt is in almost total control of 
the offense. During the 80s, Erhardt ran 
the offense while Parcells focused on 
defense or special teams. The press, how­
ever, recognizes Parcells as the main 
reason the Giants won two Super Bowls. 
The press has convinced Parcells that he 
is a mastermind, “one of the best.” 
Parcells has taken this attitude to New 
England with him, but he is going to 
take a lot of lumps before he even puts a 
.500 team on the field.
Another overrated coach is George 
Seifert. I cannot stand hearing about 
how great a record he has in the NFL. He 
took over a Super Bowl team! His true 
colors showed through last week in New 
Orleans. After his team gave up a first 
down, he flipped out. It took him a while 
to settle down, meanwhile, the Saints 
drove towards the 49ers’ end zone. It’s 
easy to show composure when your team 
is 14-2; let’s see how Seifert coaches 
when his team starts to struggle.
On the other hand, another coach with 
a couple of rings gets almost no press. 
Joe Gibbs, “the Professor of Football,” 
won Super Bowls with two very differ­
ent teams. Every year he produced a 
competitive team and frequently went 
to the playoffs. Unlike Parcells, Gibbs 
was portrayed as an everyday coach who 
managed to win a few more games than 
he should have.
Don’t put Bill Walsh in the same class 
as Seifert. Walsh’s fascination with foot­
ball helped him to four Super Bowls: 
just don’t let him be the color man for a 
football game.
After four weeks I’m up to 10-10. The 
two upsets go to the Colts and the Dol­
phins. Miami beat the Bills 22-13 while 
the Colts upset the Browns 23-10. For 
the Colts, this means they are 2-1 and 
for the Browns, well, reality just hit 
them like a runaway train. Add the Jets 
over the Patriots 45-7, and the AFC 
East looks damn close.
In Houston, Jim Everett looked im­
pressive as the Rams upset the Oilers 
28-13. The Rams are showing that they 
want to play ball this year.
How about them Steelers? The 
Steelers’ defense only gave up three 
points to one of the best offenses in the 
league; then Foster gave up seven and 
the special teams gave up seven. The 
defense even scored more than it gave
up! For their 45—17 win, I give the 
Steelers 1/2 of the Team of the Week 
Award. The other half goes to the Saints.
After being kept down by the 49ers so 
long, the Saints finally did it. It was not 
in overtime (like I had predicted), but it 
was with five seconds left. Morton Ander­
son (who else?) kicked the game winning 
field goal to give the Saints the other 
half of the Team of the Week Award. 
Saints fans could probably give you a 
hundred thousand reasons why this win 
was big, but you only need one. The 
Saints are in control of their own divi­
sion. They don’t have to worry about 
what the 49ers are going to do as long as 
they keep winning. But I’m still not sure 
the Saints can win a playoff game.
The Vikings won a big game over the 
Packers, 15-13. The Vikings are im­
proving but they still aren’t putting the 
ball in the end zone. The Lions beat the 
Cardinals, 26—20, the Bears beat the 
Buccaneers, 47-17, and ah, oh yeah, the 
Seahawks beat the “Bungals” 19-10. By 
the way, the Bengals have to hold on to 
the “Bosworth Award” for one more week 
because Jerry Glanville (if he were fired 
this week) would probably not return 
the award.

neering major.
Top Five Picks for Week 6 
from John Weber
1. San Diego at Pittsburgh
The up and down Steelers seem to 
be ready to play football. The Chargers 
are literally charging along. Steelers 
20-15.
2. Houston at Buffalo
Hey, Mr. Pardee, start Commander 
Cody CarlsonI I wonder if Frank Reich 
will start this one. Bills 24-16.
3. Miami at Cleveland
Whoa, the Doghouse and all that 
stuff. Nah, take Marino In a squeaker.
19-16.
4. Denver at Green Bay
If Green Bay loses this one, Reggie 
White might begolfing in January. Pack­
ers 20-6.
5. N.Y. Jets at L.A. Raiders
The Jets looked too good against the 
Patriots. Take the Jets. 31-21.
Pittsburgh better for NBA than Toronto
The Gym Rat
by Lubomir W. Kochanskyj
Is there going to be a new basketball team in 
Toronto? Sure looks that way. On Thursday, the 
NBA expansion committee unanimously selected 
one of three Toronto groups who were vying for a 
chance to start play in the 1995-1996 season. The 
franchise fee will run as much as $140 million.
The last time the NBA expanded was 1987 when 
the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, 
and Minnesota Timberwolves paid $32.5 million 
for the honor.
Since 1987, professional basketball has surpassed 
baseball as the most popular sport in America.
2 That might help to explain the disparingly high fee 
being sought for the Toronto franchise.
While I am on the subject of money, how much 
. money would this new team expect to make? How
• popular will basketball be in Canada? The Ameri­
can baseball-basketball relationship does not ap- 
1'
ply to Canada. Hockey is king in Canada, and will 
remain so.
Sure, Toronto is a successful sports market, with 
its World Champion Blue Jays who consistently 
play outstanding baseball, and last year’s hockey 
semi-finalist Maple Leafs who have a very erratic 
record over the last twenty years, drawing numer­
ous sellouts. Something tells me that basketball
will not be as sue- _______________________________
cessful, or popu­
lar.
Toronto is an 
expensive city to 
live in. Tickets to 
the Jays and 
Leafs usually 
start around $20 
a pop.
B asketball 
can’t be much dif­
ferent. People will 
not want to spend 
so much to see a 
game that they 
might not know 
much about,
played by a team with no big name stars.
I want to see a team, succeed in Toronto, and in 
Canada as a whole, but I don’t think it will happen.
... to see the likes of Jordan, 
Barkley, Ewing, Oneal, and Mullin 
gives me a warm feeling in my 
shooting hand. As you know, I am 
the Gym Rat, and basketball is 
my religion. The Civic Arena 
would instantly become my 
shrine.
A stadium has not yet been built, forcing the team 
to play its inaugural season in the Skydome. That 
will be scary. Sort of like the NCAA basketball 
championships that were held in the Astrodome. 
Not too many great seats. Even the Detroit Pistons 
were forced to play in the Pontiac Silverdome until 
the Palace in Auburn Hills was built.
I can honestly say that I think the NBA would be
______________________________ better off having
a team in Pitts­
burgh. Sounds far 
fetched, you say. 
The Pittsburgh 
Post Gazette re­
ported last week 
that a group was 
trying to receive 
one of the fran­
chise teams for 
Pittsburgh. They 
want to call it the 
Pride. I’m not too 
crazy about the 
name, but the 
idea of taking a 
ride downtown to 
see the likes of Jordan, Barkley, Ewing, 0‘Neall, 
and Mullin gives me a warm feeling in my shooting 
hand. As you know, I am the Gym Rat, and basket­
ball is my religion. The Civic Arena would in­
stantly become my shrine.
But seriously, Pittsburgh already has a very fine 
arena, and has a history of successful sports teams 
and fans. Even the Pittsburgh Pipers of the old 
American Basketball League won a championship 
in the 1960s.
A major question would be what to call the new 
team. Pipers has already been used, and I’m not too 
crazy about it anyway, so forget that one. How 
about “Air Pittsburgh” in honor of our new airport. 
What about calling them the Strikers in honor of 
all our local unions? Yes, the Strikers sounds good.
Obviously the major question is which group has 
$140 million to invest in a new basketball team fbr 
Pittsburgh.
I suggest we start a collection right here at 
Carnegie Mellon from current and former stu­
dents. I will be taking collections at The Tartan 
Sports department in Skibo. Give generously and 
often.
My main man Larry Bird would be the clear 
choice for head coach and I will love you for it.

Brett, Ryan say goodbye, Baltimore rejoices
Baseball with Andy
by Andy Glendinning
I’m too young to start feeling 
old. When did Nolan Ryan ever 
feet old enough to retire? To me he 
^vas always just this timeless 
entity that could throw a ball 
about three times faster than I 
could ever hope to. He never 
seemed to age at all; I just as­
sumed that he’d be around for- 
[ ever.
Look at his stats; the only sign 
of age you’ll find there are the 
s records he set for being the oldest 
•pitcher to throw ten or more
strikeouts in a game, pitch a no­
hitter, and win the All-Star Game.
Sure looks like Geritol mate­
rial to me. He pitched seasons of 
over 200 strikeouts in each of his 
last three decades — he’s played 
in four decades! He was always 
the person you thought of as the 
“perfect” pitcher.
Ryan had already announced 
that this season would be his last, 
but to have it end on such a disap­
pointing note is almost an insult 
to so great a pitcher. He tore a 
ligament in his right elbow while 
pitching against the Mariners, 
an injury taking him out of the 
last few games of the season. He 
threw a pitch to Seattle’s Dave 
Magadan and just sort of winced. 
That wince signaled the end of 
his career and his beginning in 
baseball history.
Ryan has amassed almost as 
many pitching records as you
could imagine. His most amazing 1,500 strikeouts away, 
record though, and the one that I can’t say what baseball will be
some say will never be broken, is like without him next year. But 
his career strikeout record. At at least the Orioles won’t have to
"Baseball will really be missing 
something without him [Brett], 
but at least the O’s don't have 
him to worry about anymore ... 
Baltimore is out of playoff conten­
tion; I can’t say I didn't expect 
that.”
5,714, his stands high atop the face him anymore — hey, they 
pile by a long shot; the pitcher need all the help they can get 
closest to his record still is over right now.
George Brett won’t be around 
next year either. He’s finishing 
his 20-year career with the Roy­
als this season. Used mostly as a 
Designated Hitter this season, 
Brett will end his career with a 
batting average at .305, more 
than 3,000 hits, and almost 1,600 
RBI. He also collected 664 
doubles, 137 triples, 315 
homeruns, and 200 stolen bases 
during the last 20 years.
In two World Series appear­
ances in 1980 and 1985, Brett 
batted .373.
The Royals have never been 
even close to being my favorite 
team, but I always did like Brett. 
Whether he was playing third 
base, first base, or DH, he was 
always a force to be reckoned 
with at the plate.
Always a consistent batter, 
Brett is the only player to ever 
win a batting title in three differ­
ent decades: .333 in 1976, .390 in 
1980, and .329 inl990.
Baseball will really be missing 
something without him, but at 
least the O’s don’t have him to 
worry about anymore.
And now for my little blurb 
about the Orioles. Well, Balti­
more is out of playoff contention; 
I can’t say I didn’t expect that. 
However, the news isn’t all bad 
when it comes to the O’s: catcher 
Chris Hoiles was named AL 
Player of the Month. Last month 
he hit 22 RBI and was batting 
.364.
Now why couldn’t the rest of 
the team follow his lead? I mean, 
they got a brand new stadium 
and tons of sellout crowds. What 
else do they need?

Detroit should win 
new Central Division
The Puck Stops Here
by Allan Bourdius
The new Central Division may just be the most 
competitive in the realigned NHL. Each of the six 
teams (the Chicago Blackhawks, Dallas Stars, 
Detroit Red Wings, St, Louis Blues, Toronto Maple 
Leafs, and the Winnipeg Jets) has the potential to 
be a champion—or a cellar dweller. Five of the six 
division members had over .500 records last season 
and made the playoffs.
The Central is also the only division that hasn’t 
fcot an expansion team in it. Detroit will probably 
tome out on top but overall, the teams are very well 
balanced. Instead of reviewing them in potential 
finishing order, I’ll point out some of their com­
parative strengths and weaknesses.
Offense
Detroit, Toronto, and Winnipeg could best be 
characterized as offensive, or scoring, teams. Key 
offensive players for Detroit are centers Sergei 
Fedorov and Steve Yzerman, left wings Bob Probert 
and John Ogrodnick, right wing Dino Ciccarelli, 
tod defenseman Paul Coffey. Yzerman andFedorov 
are the best one two punch at center in the league 
;oday. They are even more effective when Fedorov 
>lays one of Yzerman’s wings. Between them, they 
;cored 92 goals last season. Probert can only help 
,he scoring long as he stops his violent acts and 
itays out of the penalty box. Ogrodnick and 
piccarelli are both highly capable scorers but are 
both aging; Ciccarelli is the better of the two and 
should have yet another 40+ goal season if his 33- 
year old legs don’t give out on him.
I Paul Coffey, the all time highest scoring 
defenseman, is simply explosive moving the puck 
out of the defensive zone and acts more like a third 
winger than a second defenseman. Unfortunately, 
his offensive rushes leave a big hole back on the 
|>lue line.
i Winnipeg possesses one of the strongest attacks 
in the league today. 1992-93 Rookie of the Year 
Teemu Selanne broke both Mike Bossy’s record for 
faost goals by a rookie (76) and Peter Stastny’s 
record for most points by a rookie (132). Selanne 
pill likely score a goal a game pace and is second 
Only to Buffalo’s Alexander Mogilny at the right 
Wing position. Balance is the best word character­
izing the Jets’ other scorers. Thomas Steen, Paul 
Ysebaert, Alexi Zhamnov, Darrin Shannon, and 
Keith Tkachuck will all score more than their fair 
share of goals.
i Ysebaert is particularly good at beginning the 
attack from the defensive sone. Zhamnov is a 
talented young player who has yet to reach his 
fiotential. He could be just as prolific a scorer as 
Selanne if he lives up to expectations. Only time 
will tell. The recent acquisition of Nelson Emerson 
will help the team.
The Toronto Maple Leafs have six players who 
are key to their offensive presence: Glenn Ander­
son, Dave Andreychuck, Wendell Clark, John 
Cullen, Doug Gilmour, and Peter Zezel. Anderson 
and Andreychuck are snipers. Both are proven 40 
goal scorers and should each rack up 35 or more 
this season.
Gilmour and Cullen are two of the most capable 
centers in the league; each should contribute 25+ 
goals and 120 points. Zezel and Clark are play- 
makers. They won’t score much themselves, but 
they’ll create great opportunities.
Aside from these three, St. Louis has an attack 
led by Brendan Shanahan, Craig Janney, and 
Brett Hull which can’t be underestimated. Edge: 
Winnipeg.
Defense
Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas have the better 
defensive squads, although Toronto’s can’t be ig­

nored either. Chicago has one of the premier 
defensemen in the league in Chris Chelios. Chelios, 
a former Norris Trophy winner, is also a talented 
offensive player. He is assisted on the blue line by 
tough guys Craig Muni and Bryan Marchment. 
Marchment is talented but has a definite tendency 
towards taking stupid, senseless penalties that 
could put the Hawks into trouble. Chicago has 
three excellent defensive, checking forwards in 
Christian Ruuttu, Brent Sutter, and Jocelyn 
Lemieux.
Dallas had better hope that their defense holds 
out or they will likely fill the spot of cellar dweller. 
The Stars’ defense is led by Paul Cavallini, Jim 
Johnson, Craig Ludwig, and Mark Tinordi.
Tinordi is a perennial all star and has the capa­
bility to dominate the defensive zone in the same 
way as New Jersey’s Scott Stevens or Pittsburgh’s 
Ulf Samuelsson. Expect a lot of offensive contribu­
tion from Cavallini while Ludwig and Johnson are 
more of the “stay at home” style.
Shorthanded play should be one of the Stars’ 
strong suits. NealBroten, Dave Gagner, UlfDahlen, 
and Brian Propp are some of the best penalty 
killing forwards in the league. If 1991 first round 
pick Richard Matvichuck develops as hoped, the 
Stars will be a defensive force to reckon with.
St. Louis’ defensive hopes revolve around Phil 
Housley, the recent acquisition from Winnipeg. 
Housley will fill the wide gap on the Blues’ blue line 
left when Scott Stevens was lost to New Jersey in 
the Brendan Shanahan deal.
Hockey Digest recently ranked Housley as the 
top offensive defenseman in the league today. Last 
season he scored better than a point a game. His 
offensive power throws his defensive talent into 
the background. Expect some strong checks and 
key shot blocks out of the former Jet.
Don’t expect much offense from the rest of St. 
Louis’ defense, but Jeff Brown, Garth Butcher, 
Doug Crossman, Rick Zombo, and Lee Norwood 
are all NHL-class defenders. All things considered, 
the Blues will probably have the best defense in the 
division.
Goaltender
Detroit is the only team who is weak at this 
position. Toronto’s hope for a winning season re­
ally lies with second year goaltender Felix Potvin. 
Potvin was amazing last year during the second 
half of the season and the playoffs but tended to be 
streaky. If he’s on his game, he’s nearly impossible 
to beat.
Chicago has one ofthe top three or four goalies in 
the game today in Ed Belfour. Belfour is a consis­
tently among the league leaders in save percent­
age, goals against average, and wins. Belfour is a 
tough man to beat because of his size, speed, and 
refusal to give up rebounds. Unfortunately, his 
size also means that once he goes down, he’s down 
for the count. Belfour can be beaten in close. St. 
Louis’ top defense is completed by goalie Curtis 
Joseph. Joseph was last season’s save percentage 
leader and made the most total saves of any 
goaltender.
Winnipeg’s Bob Essensa isn’t as flashy or over­
powering as Belfour or Joseph but is a consistent 
winner, year in and year out. He plays the angles 
especially well but, like Belfour, is vulnerable in 
close. Dallas’ Andy Moog is solid, but possibly over 
the hill. Detroit’s two goaltending question marks 
are Tim Cheveldae and Vincent Riendeau.
The Red Wings will probably alternate between 
the two simply because neither of them have ever 
shown the consistency so necessary for a starting 
goaltender.
Detroit’s offense should be enough to carry them 
over their defensive lackings.
However, if things really fall apart for the Red 
Wings in the defensive zone, look for both Toronto 
and Winnipeg to come knocking. St. Louis could 
suprise everybody, but they seem to be lacking 
depth on the wings.
Next week, a look at the Pacific Division and my 
playoff predictions. The regular season starts this 
Tuesday night.

CMU rugby loses 12-7 
to Salem-Teikyo College
By JUSTIN LAM
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In a rainy match against Sa­
lem-Teikyo College, the CMU 
Rugby team lost by the score of 
12-7 on Saturday. After a one- 
and-a-half hour game delay, 
Salem-Teikyo scored in the 
first 10 minutes of play. ST’s 
outside center, Shin Yoshinari 
took advantage of a 4 on 3 
running situation and broke 
through the CMU defense to 
score a try, making the score 
7-0. For much of the first half, 
both teams traded scoring 
opportunités. The score ended 
7-0 at halftime.
At the beginning of the sec­
ond half, ST forward Keisuke 
Hasajawa scored another try
to put the score at 12-0, but they 
could not convert on the points 
after conversion kick. For much 
of the second half, CMU showed 
signs that they could come back 
with outstanding breakaway run­
ning from senior Shugie Proctor, 
faculty member Doug Balog, and 
sophomore Marcus Schlegal, 
among others. However, they 
were not able to captalize until 
the end of the second half, when 
senior Mike Keller broke through 
to score. Sophomore Javier Rocha 
converted successfully, making 
the score 12-7.
The match against ST proved 
to be a learning experience for 
the CMU team. CMU ordinarily 
relies on their finesse to win, for 
they are usually the smaller team. 
However, the experience and bet-
ter finesse that the smaller ST 
team carried to Sullivan Park 
proved to be too much for CMU. 
The ST squad was led by very 
experienced Japanese students 
whose sophisticated running 
tactics dominated the CMU 
ruggers today.
The loss to ST drops CMU to 
a record of 1—2. Next Satur­
day, the Tartans travel to 
Bethany College, and on Octo­
ber 16 CMU plays the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh Johnstown 
at home.
The PittsburghWomen’s 
Rugby Club meets Tuesdays 
and Thursdays at 6" pm, and 
Sundays at 1 pm on Flagstaff 
Hill. No experience is necesary.

Women’s Volleyball team loses 
three straight to Wooster College
By RAMSEY HONG
Tartan Art Editor
Last Monday the UAA Volleyball Round Robin 
hosted here at Carnegie Mellon University was 
wrapped up as Brandeis defeated the Tartans in 
the last match. The final standings put the Carnegie 
Mellon Tartans in the eighth seed under Brandeis 
(7), Case Western Reserve (6), Emory (5), New 
York (4), Rochester (3), Chicago (2), and Washing­
ton University of St. Louis(l).
The results of the round robin are used to deter­
mine which teams play in which pool. In each pool 
there will be four teams who play against each 
other to determine which teams then go on to the 
single-elimination bracket.
It is in the single-elimination bracket that the
UAA champion is determined. This year’s UAA 
Championship Tournament is going to be held at 
the University of Rochester beginning October 29.
On Saturday the Tartans played at the College of 
Wooster.
Unfortunately, they lost in three straight games. 
The scores 15-8, 16-14, and 19-17 reflect the 
intense play that occured at the match.
Head coach Heather Hollands was optimistic 
despite the team’s loss. “The scores don’t reflect 
how they played. I think we played well.”
The Tartans play next at Chatham College with 
University of Steubenville in a tri-match on Octo­
ber 12 and then at home with Bethany College on 
October 14 at 6 pm.
The team then travels to Western Maryland 
College The tourney will be held on October 15-16,

How TO GET THERE:
Take the 1-376 east to the Pennsylvania Turnpike east.
When it splits, continue along 1-70 south. Take 1-70 until its 
junction with 1-270. Follow 1-270 south, and you're in 
Washington D.C.
pb rB, HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
D.C.
Everyone knows it's there. Almost everyone's been there. 
But do you really know what there is to do in Washington,
D.C.?
Probably not. The tourist attractions are many, and there is 
usually little time to see all of them.
However, there is one important fact.
You should see all of them.
Once you get there, there's plenty to do, and you should 
have no problem amusing yourself. It is a diverse, fast-paced 
city with no ends. Looking at various areas of the city, you can 
see the amount there is to do. So sit back, relax, and enjoy this 
tour of Washington by words....
Washington, D.C.
The city itself becomes an attraction for more than 17 
million people a year. It's no surprise that when you're there, 
there will probably be many tourists at all the attractions. The 
city itself has a population of just under 650,000, making it one 
of the 20 largest cities in the U.S.
Capitol Hill
This area, probably one of the most active and most beauti­
ful of the city, includes the U.S. Capitol building, the meeting 
place of Congress; the Supreme Court; and the Library of 
Congress. The National Visitors Center is also located in this 
area of town, and is a great place to get more information about 
the city.
While there, the U.S. Capitol and the Library of Congress 
are two things that you shouldn't miss. The Capitol tour allows 
you to see sessions of Congress (if they're in session) and the 
beauty of the building. You have the best chance of catching 
them if you go on Monday. Congress normally isn't in session 
on weekends, but it is possible if an urgent matter arises. Go 
early, as these tours fill up fast.
The Library of Congress doesn't have a tour, but it is open 
to the public. You can find amazing books here, and the main 
reading room is not to be missed. (If you look hard, you should 
be able to find copies of The Tartan there somewhere.)
The Mall
Just as we have our own mall here at Carnegie Mellon, the 
Mall extending west of the Capitol building is the central point 
of all Washington, D.C. Walking west from the Capitol, there 
are many small art galleries, as well as the huge National 
Gallery of Art. Anyone can enjoy this art museum, since it 
houses everything from the Renaissance to modern works of art 
and sculpture.
Also located along the Mall are the Smithsonian Museums, 
also known as the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian 
Museums are comprised of the Great Hall, the National Air and 
Space Museum, the National Museum of Natural History, the 
National Museum of Man, and the National Museum of 
American History. Together, they create what is perhaps the 
most stunning collection of history, art and science anywhere in 
the world. The Air and Space Museum is one of the most 
popular attractions in Washington, and houses Charles 
Lindberg's "Spirit of St. Louis," several samples of moon rock, 
and a hot air balloon, among other exhibits.
Farther west, the end of the Mall is home to the reflecting 
pool and the 555 foot Washington Monument. Also along this 
route are the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials, both to the south 
side of the mall. Looking farther south, Arlington National 
Cemetery is across the Potomac River. North of the Mall a short 
distance away is the Vietnam Memorial, dedicated in 1982.
This is another no-miss area.
The White House
No one would forget to tour the White House, right? Of 
course not. However, the area around it contains many small 
attractions. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is near here, as is 
the Treasury building. There are monuments, memorials, and 
famous houses galore in a one-square-mile area around the 
executive mansion.
Georgetown
Washington doesn't only consist of important national 
landmarks. Georgetown is one place to just relax and enjoy.
Located in the northwest portion of Washington, this area 
of the city contains historic Georgetown University, one of the 
nation's oldest colleges. In the beginning of the century, 
Georgetov/n became a beautiful residential area. It remains so, 
and now has many sidewalk shopping areas for visitors to 
browse. Georgetown University is also a worthwhile tour stop.
Other Areas
It would take a whole newspaper to go through the list of 
sights to see in Washington. Other attractions not to miss 
include the J. Edgar Hoover Building, located downtown and 
home to the FBI, and the CIA headquarters, across the river.
The Old Post Office on 12th Street is a beautiful example of 
older buildings in Washington. Other sights include the 
numerous cathedrals located in the city, as well as the smaller 
art galleries, libraries, old houses, and famous landmarks.
Pick a street and walk down it; finding something to tour is 
easy in Washington.

As this issue goes to press, Philadelphia wobbles just on 
the brink of sucking itself and everything in the surrounding 20 
' miles into total monetary oblivion. But no matter. All you need 
to know is that this is the best time to visit Philadelphia. Go 
now, before winter brings its fist down all the way and before 
Cleveland buys up half of the landmarks at the bankruptcy 
auction.
Start your tour at the Franklin Institute, which began as a 
museum dedicated to the history of science and technology. 
Late this spring, an almost complete overhaul made its new 
Futures Center the centerpiece of the museum. Many.of the 
older exhibits survived the remodeling, such as those devoted 
to electricity, general physics, aerospace, mathematics, and 
time, although most of these received some enhancements as 
well. The Institute that emerged from the fusion now straddles 
past and anticipated future.
Admission prices vary, depending on whether or not you 
choose to buy tickets to the Fels Planetarium and the 
Omniverse Theater. Unless you are extremely strapped for 
cash or time, buy the tickets. Both shows are quite worthwhile.
The venerable Fels Planetarium shows programs which 
usually last half an hour. The domed room does its job more 
than well; even before the projectors start up, the muted 
acoustics, fresh air, and dim blue lighting have the visitor half 
convinced that the city has been left hundreds of miles behind 
for a quiet moonlit field. The shows, with their gently moving 
visuals and casual, low voice-overs, cast a relaxing spell. Don't 
worry about falling asleep, though — the experience of watch­
ing a show projected on the underside of a dome, not to men­
tion the unusual subjects, will keep you wide awake and 
interested, despite the pacific setting.
"Relaxing" is probably not the word for the Institute's 
other projection system, the Omniverse theater. Only seasoned 
fighter pilots or the heavily sedated will be able to avoid 
flinching at least once in the course of a show. The screen is 
three stories high and curves inward horizontally and vertically 
to cover almost the entire forward viewing angle of its audi­
ence, which sits along the opposite wall in a clifflike arrange­
ment. The illusion of motion is virtually perfect, sometimes 
dizzyingly so. Something about watching a launching Space 
Shuttle at a good fraction of actual size leaves an impression on 
the viewer. If you can only see one thing at the musuem, attend 
an Omniverse show. It leaves 3-D movies looking flat, and tops 
a good number of roller coasters for sheer vertigo.
Penn's Landing is as scenic as any section of the Delaware 
River in the Philadelphia area gets. Generally, this is not 
terribly strong praise, but Penn's Landing is actually quite 
pleasant. Points of interest along this extended pedestrian 
walkway include the U.S. Maritime history museum, and the 
U.S.S. Olympia and Becuna. The Olympia and Becuna are, 
respectively, a battleship from the Spanish-American war and a 
World-War-II vintage submarine. Both have now found their 
final mooring places as tourable floating history lessons.
Appeal to maritime history buffs aside, those in the know 
regard Penn's Landing as a prelude to South Street.
After passing the Olympia and Becuna from the direction 
of the Maritime museum, cross 1-95 and then continue to follow 
the direction of the Delaware. After passing Philadelphia's 
Vietnam veterans' memorial, you will come to an inoffensive- 
looking parking lot overlooking the end of Penn's Landing.
Do not be deceived. You stand at the beginning of South 
Street.
Depending on your viewpoint, South Street is either one of 
the most bizarre places in Philadelphia, or one of the most 
entertaining. Possibly both. It's the city's repository for things 
and people too odd or offbeat to expose the general public to.
On a seasonable day, it's the perfect place to kill an after­
noon. Among the restaurants, bistros, and cafés are various 
small shops offering quick and portable noshes, like water ice
and the Philadelphia specialty, 
cheesesteak. A little way to your right at 
the first major intersection is Caroline's 
Bakery, thought by many to offer the 
best chocolate chip cookies in Philadel­
phia.
There's almost as much variety in 
clothing as in food. Hats in the Belfry 
offers headgear both mundane and 
exotic. Various corner stores sell T-Shirts 
ranging from black Bart Simpson 
bootlegs to pleasant reminders of your 
stay in Philly ("I went to Philadelphia, 
and got mugged, beaten up, and raped, 
but I still had a good time!"). Last, but 
certainly not least, are Kinki Bobo's and 
Zipperhead, your only source for the latest in designer plastic, 
rubber, and leather (yes, we are still on the subject of clothing).
Tower Records offers one of the widest selections of tapes, 
CDs, and LPs around. At other small stores, role-playing and 
comics enthusiasts will find sourcebooks, game sets, minia­
tures, and graphic (some, extremely graphic) novels galore. 
Antiques of almost every kind, from furniture to books, are to 
be found. For those whose wallets possess more than the mere 
illusion of depth, there's even a store selling holographic art.
If touring the city is not your cup of tea, there are two very 
good alternatives.
Longwood Gardens, located in Langhorne, about one hour 
from Philadelphia, was originally an estate of the Pierce- 
DuPont (of DuPont Chemical fame) family. The estate is now 
open to the public for $8. The Gardens cover several hundred 
acres, and are divided into areas of widely varying style: 
carefully tended rose bushes and topiary animals at one 
extreme, an open field, with mown paths leading through the 
tall grass, at the other.
Even in the dead of winter, or on the rainiest day of the 
season, Longwood Gardens is still worth visiting. Its vast 
conservatories cover several acres all their own, and include 
flora from almost every environment, ranging from full-grown 
tropical fruit trees, draped with hanging vines, to several dozen 
different varieties of cactus.
There are also several specialty greenhouses adjacent to the 
primary ones, showcasing themes such as medicines and herbs, 
carnivorous plants, and orchids. The orchid display in particu­
lar is a must-see.
Visitors who wish to spend the better portion of the day 
will be able to break for lunch or dinner at the Terrace restau­
rant, located immediately opposite the conservatories.
The Tyler Arboretum, like Longwood Gardens, began as a 
private estate; unlike Longwood, however, it was first parceled 
out among various heirs.
The Arboretum is much less cultivated than Longwood 
Gardens. Most of it is simply hilly woods. The visitor's center 
sells postcards, handcrafted goods, and birdseed, amoung other 
things. Buy what you will, but make sure you get a map, which 
will give you a little of the historical background of the park, 
and, hopefully, a passing chance of knowing where you are.
The danger of getting seriously lost is slim, however, since 
the Arboretum is not large enough for you to be able to walk 
more than an hour without returning to a recognizable spot or 
a clearly marked trail. Besides, there's great sport in getting 
lost; several ruins from the Arboretum's days as private real 
estate dot the landscape, and since they are unmarked on the 
map, are most likely found by those who do not know where 
they're going.

Toronto is an international city that sits on the edge of Lake 
Ontario. Like Chicago and New York City, it is brimming with 
cultural diversity, a hopping nightlife, shopping opportunities 
galore, and an abundance of skyscrapers. Unlike its American 
counterparts, however, Toronto is a very clean city, due to strict 
Canadian laws. The city is big enough to be a major cosmopoli­
tan area but small enough that you can't get lost; the CN 
Tower, which on a clear day can be seen from across the lake in 
the U.S., is a convenient reference point.
A taste of old Toronto can be found with a visit to Old Fort 
York. Established in 1783, this fort was the scene of a bloody 
battle during the War of 1812. Although mid-semester break is 
beyond the summer's schedule of battle-scene reenactments it's 
still worth the trip.
Also worth the trip is Mackenzie House, at 82 Bond Street, 
home of Toronto's first mayor, William Lyon Mackenzie. 
Mackenzie's ghost is said to walk the staircase and play the 
piano on occasion. The nineteenth century furnishings and 
Mackenzie family heirlooms are on display for the curious.
For the culturally inclined, three "must-see" places in 
Toronto are the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), the adjacent 
McLaughlin Planetarium, and the Art Gallery of Toronto. The 
ROM's collection of artifacts range from Mesopotamian art to 
ancient Greek gold to thirteenth century Chinese temple wall 
paintings. With over 9000 works spread over twenty galleries, 
The Art Gallery of Toronto, at the heart of Chinatown, is well 
worth the $4 admission.
You should include the world famous CN Tower on your 
list of sites to see. A trip to the top reveals a view that is simply 
breathtaking. A trip to the bottom of the CN Tower provides an 
adventure of a different kind. The highly touted (and some­
what overpriced at about $11) Tour of the Universe is a major 
tourist attraction. The tour starts at a spaceport at the base of 
the tower taking you through a history of mankind's space 
exploration. It concludes with a trip to the outer reaches of the 
galaxy via an all-too-short but incredible flight simulator ride.
Still more touristy places to see are the Ontario Science 
Centre, Carling O'Keefe Brewery, the new Skydome — home of 
the Blue Jays — the Toronto Zoological Gardens, Casa Loma, 
Ontario Place, and Queen's Quay (pronounced "kee"). The first 
four are self-explanatory, and the last three you can easily 
figure out for yourself.
Shopping opportunities abound in Toronto. The Eaton 
Centre is a monument to the "urge to splurge." Stores, shops, 
and restaurants of every kind can be found on this four-level 
complex. Even if you've already found that memento of 
Toronto you've been looking for, you should go inside just to 
see the sights and heights Canadian capitalism has reached.
While in the shopping mode, check out two other signifi­
cant neighborhoods: Bloor Street and Yonge Street. Bloor and 
Bay Streets are home to many upper-end shops and boutiques, 
many of which can be found under a single roof, namely the 
Holt Renfrew Centre. More than forty shops can be found in 
this grandiose building including the work of many posh 
Toronto fashion and jewelry designers.
Yonge Street is the strip in Toronto. On Yonge, you can find 
just about anything you could ever want. For example, it has 
some of Toronto's most prominent banks, a colorful cross- 
section of its population, a major portion of its record stores, 
book stores, restaurants, pubs, head shops, in addition to a 
wide variety of stores and "theaters" which pride themselves 
with some of the most sexually deviant material allowed by 
law. You can spend the major part of an entire day just by 
walking from one end of Yonge Street to the other. The nights 
in between the days of your visit are an adventure in them­
selves.
Once you've wasted away the day shopping or just seeing
the sights, a plethora of dining 
opportunities await your hungry 
stomach. Over thirty different 
kinds of cuisine are available 
including Argentine, Egyptian,
Chinese, and Vietnamese. All it 
takes is a little bit of common 
sense to find them. Consult the 
Toronto Star or the Visitor's 
Information on the ground floor 
of the Eaton Centre.
After you've had your fill, 
you will discover that Toronto 
has some of the best nightlife this 
side of New York. There are a 
number of clubs, bars, and pubs 
on Yonge Street, including North 
America's first Hard Rock Cafe.
The Toronto version may be a bit 
of a disappointment, especially if 
you've been to other Hard Rocks.
It's a hopping place but it doesn't 
have the electricity or variety that 
you might expect. You can still 
get the t-shirts, sweatshirts, 
jackets and so on, and its corner 
bar atmosphere may be just what you're looking for after a 
hard day on the streets of Toronto.
However, the Hard Rock Cafe is a far cry from the nightlife 
on Queen Street West. This is definitely the place to be. Here 
you can find several hot clubs with some of the best bands in all 
of Toronto. This is also the place to find original jewelry and 
pre-trendy clothing.
A few facts about Toronto and the nightlife: the legal 
drinking age is 19 and ID is required at just about every place 
that serves. The bars stop serving alcohol at 1 am but remain 
open until 3. It's also illegal to drink alcohol on the street. The 
police, called Mounties, don't fool around and neither should 
you.
This brings up a few things to remember. You will be in a 
foreign country. On your way you will pass through Customs 
at the border. Take the Customs inspector seriously. He or she 
will ask you your citizenship, place of birth, and destination. 
Answer with respect and courtesy. Customs inspectors are 
often suspicious of college students mostly due to our age and 
often non-standard dress.
One small but important difference exists between the trip 
there and the trip back. On your return trip, the U.S. Customs 
inspector will ask you how long you've been in Canada and if 
you have anything to declare. By "declare," he or she is asking 
what, if anything, you have purchased in Canada and are 
bringing back across the border. If you stay less than forty-eight 
hours and spent more than $25, then you have to pay a duty 
fee. This spending limit extends to $100 if you stayed for more 
than two days.
Although most inspectors don't take the time to search 
your car, they have the legal right to do so. They can take 
everything apart, down to removing the back seats and check­
ing the insides of the tires. And they are not required by law to 
put it back together when done.
The monetary unit of Canada is the Canadian dollar. 
Approximately 80 cents in American money is worth a dollar of 
Canadian money. It's probably easiest to just stop in to a bank 
and convert your money when you first get to Canada rather 
than trying to use American dollars on the streets of Toronto.

I beach as waves 
crash on the shore. Gulls fly overhead and Spring Break seems 
to be finally here.
However, further inspection shows a strange sight: a 
warmly dressed fisherman walking down the beach. He 
approaches a pier and looks up at a sign reading, "Presque Isle 
State Park." This isn't Spring Break — it's midsemester break at 
Lake Erie.
Presque Isle State Park, a peninsula next to the city of Erie, 
is an ideal place to spend a warm fall day. Many picnic tables 
are located throughout the sandy park. Boating is another 
popular activity; canoes, rowboats, and motorboats can be 
rented at a site in the park. Hiking and fishing are also avail­
able, though no lifeguards are on duty between Labor Day and 
Memorial Day.
Trout and salmon fishing seasons last all year on Lake Erie; 
fishing on the lake's tributaries is allowed only during the day. 
Other kinds of fish in the area include coho salmon, largemouth 
bass, smallmouth bass, and panfish. For more fishing informa­
tion call the Fish Commission's fishing and boating hot line.
The shoreline of Lake Erie is also known for its wineries. 
You can take tours of the winemaking process, which are 
usually followed by a tasting of wines from that vineyard. 
Wineries in the area include Heritage Wine Cellars, Mazza 
Vineyards, Penn Shore Vineyards, and Presque Isle Wine 
Cellars. All are located a short distance from the city of Erie. 
Penn Shore Vineyards operates a shop locally in North Hills 
during the months of November and December.
A reconstruction of Commodore Oliver H. Perry's flagship, 
the Niagral, is one of many historical sites found in the area. 
Others include Perry Memorial House, a part of the Under­
ground Railroad to Canada; Warner Theatre, built by the 
famous Warner Brothers in 1929; and the Eagle Hotel, where 
the only known statue of George Washington in a British 
uniform is located.

Baltimore is a short day's drive and a perfect spot to spend a long weekend. Full of shops, 
restaurants, and other attractions, Baltimore is an exciting place to spend some time, or a conve­
nient "home base" for visiting other cities.
If you want to get "up close and personal" with the water, a boat tour of Baltimore Harbor 
and the surrounding rivers might be in order. For more fun in the water, you can also rent boats 
which are operated bicycle-style and paddle around in the water to your heart's delight.
For those of you who like to look at water without necessarily being in it, Baltimore also 
offers attractions on shore. The Inner Harbor/Harbor Place area, a collection of fine restaurants 
and shops, provides a nice view of the adjacent harbor (hence the name) and is a popular tourist 
attraction. The city is also home to the famous National Aquarium in Baltimore, which is 
definitely worth seeing. One unusual feature is a ramp spiralling around a fishtank four floors 
high. The Aquarium costs $9.25, but if you're 18 or under you can get in at the student rate of 
$7.25. They admit people from 10 am to 5 pm but you're allowed to stay in for one and a half 
hours after closing. On fridays, it's open until 8 pm. There's also a science center, which is fun, 
but mainly for kids.
Besides having so much to offer itself, Baltimore is also very close to some other major 
attractions and a nice place to stay if you want to do some exploring. Annapolis, home of the 
United States Naval Academy and a beautiful little town, is only 40 minutes away. If you drive 
for an hour, you will be in Washington D.C., and can enjoy the city without having to stay there.
Although Baltimore may not be the first thing that pops into your mind when someone 
mentions midsemester break, think about it. It's a beautiful city with a lot to offer, but not so 
much that you can't handle it in a weekend.

---------------------------------------------------

rviitri unvuig eigm nuuxs uuuugu vvhat seems to be the 
world's largest continuous com field, it may be hard to believe 
that you could possibly have arrived in the nation's third 
largest city, trailing only New York and Los Angeles in popula­
tion and second only to New York in financial influence.
But that's exactly what Chicago is. Located on the western 
shore of Lake Michigan, Chicago has all the excitement and 
possibilities of any of the world's major cities and much of the 
laid-back midwestern atmosphere of the surrounding areas.
One could not possibly see all of Chicago's attractions in a 
weekend any more than one could do so in any city. The 
following are some suggested places to go and things to do 
from a native Chicagoan.
The Museum of Science and Industry on the city's South 
Side is nearly worth a trip from Pennsylvania on its own. Kids 
(and many adults) love the interactive exhibits which highlight 
everything from money to nutrition to the circus. The 
museum's highlights include a captured German U-boat, a coal 
mine, and the Omnimax Theater, which shows movies that put 
you in middle of the action. Many of the exhibits feature 
scientific concepts, but visitors without technical backgrounds 
should not be scared off. The 2000 exhibits, which cover 75 
fields are all designed to emphasize fun first and learning as a 
distant second.
The Art Institute of Chicago on Michigan Avenue down­
town is not one of my favorites, but for those people who do 
have an appreciation for art it is well worth an afternoon. It is 
one of America's great art museums.
The Adler Planetarium, located just south of downtown, 
features exhibits on astronomy, space exploration, and related 
subjects. The exhibits are interesting, but the real reason to go 
is the Sky Show, a multimedia show related to space. The 
highlight of the show is the second half, in which a 
multimillion dollar projection device (which you will have to 
see to believe) illustrates the movements of astronomical bodies 
against the 180 degree interior of the building's dome. The 
current Sky Show is "Ticket to the Stars."
The Field Museum of Natural History is within a healthy 
walk of the Adler Planetarium. Featuring collections from the 
fields of anthropology, botany, geology, and zoology, it is 
supposedly one of the world's four greatest natural history 
museums. It is not as much fun as the Museum of Science and 
Industry, but the reconstructed dinosaurs, stuffed remains of 
elephants and one of Chicago's favorite gorillas, as well as 
other the exhibits, make it one of the city's highlights.
The Shedd Aquarium, roughly halfway between the 
planetarium and the Field Museum, is the world's largest 
indoor aquarium and has 6,600 aquatic animals in 200 exhibits. 
The Coral Reef Exhibit offers the opportunity to see a diver feed 
sharks, eels, sea turtles, and other animals at 11 am and 2 pm 
daily. The aquarium is not a must-see attraction, but it is worth 
stopping for a while if you find yourself walking by.
How TO GET THERE:
Take 1-279 north to 1-79 north, and 
go to the Pennsylvania Turnpike 
west. Stay on that road. It will first 
turn into the Ohio turnpike, and 
then into the Indiana turnpike. 
You'll see signs to Chicago.
y d,ngr tg,f Staaringod
In downtown Chicago, the Sears Tower dominates the skyline.
The Board of Trade on LaSalle and Jackson Streets offers 
the opportunity to watch the world's largest commodities 
futures exchange in action. It is only open on weekdays but if 
you happen to be downtown on Monday or Friday it is worth 
a brief stop.
The Sears Tower and the John Hancock Building down­
town both offer nice views of the city. They charge admission 
though, so you should only go on a clear day. If you miss them 
altogether, you'll live.
Chicago Stadium, home of the Chicago Bulls (NBA) and 
Blackhawks (NHL), is just west of downtown. The Bulls have a 
home game on October 13 and the Blackhawks are home the 
next day. A word of caution: Chicago Stadium is in a moder­
ately bad part of town. Don't be afraid to go there but you are 
better off driving at night and you definitely want to use the 
paid parking lots.
The Chicago Bears (NFL) have a home game on October 14 
south of downtown in Soldier Field, but tickets are not much 
easier to come by than Steelers' tickets.
Any of the top comedy clubs are well worth an evening.
Some of the best are Catch a Rising Star, The Funny Firm, The 
Improv, Second City (named before L.A. took this title from 
Chicago), and Zanies Comedy Night Club. Admission prices 
and policies on admitting people under 21 vary.
The Lyric Opera and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 
both downtown, have a number of performances during the 
weekend of midsemester break.
There are, as in any city, many places to shop. Some of the 
best are along the northern portion of Michigan Ave. down­
town. Water Tower Place is a seven floor indoor shopping 
center with many of the best stores in town. Most of the other 
top stores are within walking distance.
Chicago Deep Dish Pizza! Chicago is home to some of the 
best pizza in the world. Edwardo's and Giordano's are two of 
my favorite restaurants. Both have locations in Hyde Park, the 
neighborhood which contains the Museum of Science and 
Industry and the University of Chicago. If you can't make it to 
either of these, stop any native Chicagoan and ask for a recom­
mendation; you can't lose.
For more information on things to do in Chicago, call the 
Chicago Department of Tourism.

The cardinal rule for visiting New York City is don't try to 
do it all. Your best bet is to pick an area and devote a whole day 
to it rather than running from place to place.
One area to hit is Fifth Avenue starting at the Empire State 
Building on 34th Street. The Empire State has two observation 
decks, and you can ride up to both for the same admission 
price. Expect to wait, but once you get through the lines for the 
tickets and elevators, the view is magnificent.
Continue up Fifth Avenue until you hit Central Park. You'll 
pass some of the most expensive and famous stores around, 
like Fendi, Gucci, Tiffany's, Godiva, and Fortunoff's, as well as 
Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral. One of the city's 
most famous cathedrals, St. Patrick's offers a view of its breath­
taking stain glass windows and beautiful architecture. But be 
respectful, there's likely to be a mass in progress.
Between 49th and 51st Streets you'll find Rockefeller 
Center. Stop and watch the ice skaters on the famous rink; some 
of them are quite good. Just behind Rock Center, one block off 
Fifth, is Radio City Music Hall. Sacks Fifth Avenue is directly 
across from Rockefeller Center.
Continuing down Fifth you'll see Trump Tower, which is 
worth wandering into, even if you can't afford to buy anything. 
The decor is a fantasy of glass, chrome and indoor water walls 
come true. When you reach central park, FAO Schwartz will be 
on your right and the Plaza Hotel will be on your left. Wander 
into the lobby of the beautiful Plaza Hotel, but more impor­
tantly, don't miss FAO Schwartz. There's usually a line to get 
in through the main revolving doors, which enter into a fantasy 
land of singing toys, giant Lego men, and a jungle of life size 
stuffed animals.
If you travel south to downtown Manhattan, you'll hit the 
Wall Street financial district and the World Trade Center. The 
World Trade Center has an observation deck for a moderate 
admission charge. A boardwalk runs along the water across 
from the Trade Center, and if you travel south along it you'll 
reach a big, ugly blue building. This is the terminal for the 
Staten Island Ferry. If you don't want to pay $15 or so for a boat 
tour around the city, you might want to pay the 25 cents for the 
round trip ferry ride. You'll get a good view of the Statue of 
Liberty, downtown Manhattan, and the Verazzano bridge.
About ten minutes east of the Wall Street area is South 
Street Seaport. Located half on Pier 17 and half on Fulton and 
South Streets, the Seaport has a variety of shops, restaurants 
and a maritime museum. You can also usually find a variety of 
street entertainers to watch.
Greenwich Village is another area of New York that is 
worth a day's trip. You might want to start on Broadway 
around 8th Street, where the more well known stores, such as 
Unique, Antique Boutique, and Tower Records, are located. 
From there, wander towards Washington Square park and the 
famous arch. By the way, you'll probably notice that you're in 
the heart of NYU. Stop for lunch at the Waverly Cafe on 
Waverly Place, one block off Broadway. It's a great coffee shop 
with muffins that are out of this world.
Wandering the village can get kind of tricky since the 
orderly numbers of Manhattan Streets disintegrate into small 
winding streets with names. But getting lost on the streets of 
the village isn't necessarily bad. You're practically guaranteed 
to see something you've never seen before. Venture into some 
of the more bizarre boutiques and try not to act frightened.
Go see a Broadway show, after all, New York is the only 
place you can. It doesn't have to cost a fortune. You can buy 
Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for half price at Times 
Square Center in Duffy Square. Show up at the bright orange 
booth, in the triangular park in between Broadway and 47th 
Street, early in the morning and be prepared to wait on a 
usually lengthy line. The tickets you'll wind up getting are hit 
and miss because they sell out quickly. But I've caught several 
good shows.
More sights of interest are the United Nations, located on 
First Ave. and 42nd Street; the Museum of Natural History, at 
Central Park West and 79th Street; the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, on Fifth Ave. and 82nd Street; Lincoln 
Center for the Performing Arts, located at 
Broadway and Columbus Avenues at 66th 
Street; Macy's, the world's largest depart­
ment store; and the Hard Rock Cafe.
As for night life, if you think this is a 24- 
hour campus, you haven't been to New 
York. The city never sleeps. At any time of 
the morning, you can find something to do.
Just pick up a paper, ask a friend, or call a 
place you spotted on the street during the 
day.
Let me offer a couple of words of 
warning. No, you won't necessarily get 
mugged, robbed or beaten if you walk on 
the streets of New York. Yes, you should 
probably not walk alone, especially if it is at 
night or you are female. The subways aren't 
so bad and are much cheaper than taking taxis all over. They 
are also easier to figure out than the bus system in New York 
because you can just pick up a color-coded subway map.
It's easy to feel swamped by New York, but once you get 
into the fast pace of the city, and believe me, the energy on the 
streets is enough to perk you up, you'll have a great time.

1-81, but you have to get off at 
Carlisle and go on a local road for 
no more than a mile. Take 1-81 east 
towards Harrisburg. 1-81 turns into 
1-78, which will end at the New 
Jersey Turnpike. Take the Turnpike 
north and follow signs to the Lin­
coln Tunnel.

ClTTHow TO GET THERE;
Atlantic City conjures up many 
images: The Boardwalk, casinos,
Monopoly, salt-water taffy, the Miss 
America Pageant. However, the dream 
and the reality are completely different 
things.
Before you think of traveling the 
300 miles or so it takes to get to Atlantic 
City, take heed: you must be at least 21 
years of age to gamble in the casinos.
Unlike Las Vegas, Atlantic City is very 
strict about who they let into the
casinos. So, don't count on sneaking into the casinos if you're 
underage because more than likely you'll get caught.
Second, staying in Atlantic City can become very expensive. 
The casino-hotels cost hundreds to stay in for just one night. 
However, on the outskirts of Atlantic City all along Route 40, 
you can find dozens of motels which will only cost around $30 
to $40 per night. These motels are only a few miles from the 
casinos, and you'll save a fortune.
Finally, gambling itself costs a lot of money. Forget the fact 
that you will more than likely lose most of what you gamble. 
Make sure to take into account that at most tables the minimum 
bet is $5. Although you can find some $2 tables if you look hard 
enough, don't count on gambling there because those tables are 
usually packed. The only game which won't cost you at least $5 
a pop is the slots, but they usually have the worst odds.
Now that the unpleasantries are out of the way, you can 
explore some of the attractions to be found in Atlantic City.
Getting around the town is fairly easy. Since all the casinos 
are right next to each other (except for Harrah's and the Trump 
Castle, which are on the marina) and connected by the Board­
walk, it doesn't take long to explore them all. Just park your car 
in one of the several parking garages (each casino has one) and 
then expect to do a lot of walking.
Probably your best bet is to park at the Trump Plaza garage 
since it's located at the center of the Boardwalk. It's also right 
across from Ocean One, a shopping mall built on the site of the 
legendary Million Dollar Pier — where, many years ago, one 
could go and see a horse and rider dive into the ocean. Ocean 
One is a extremely attractive mall, with over 150 shops and 
restaurants that feature just about everything. It's probably the 
best shopping to be found in Atlantic City.
Besides Ocean One, you can find a wide range of shops
Take the Pennsylvania Turnpike to Philadelphia, there 
it turns into the Schuylkill Expressway which runs 
over the Walt Whitman Bridge. Immediately after the 
bridge head south on Route 42. This will take you to 
the Atlantic City Expressway which will lead you 
straight into the center of Atlantic City.
7 1/2 HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
along the Boardwalk itself. Some places to try are Fralinger's, 
the original creators of salt-water taffy, and a fast-food place 
called Dip-Stick, which has amazing com dogs and wicked 
lemonade. Both of these shops can be found anywhere on the 
Boardwalk, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding them.
As for the entertainment (besides the gambling, of course) 
you will have to rely mostly on the casinos. The entertainment 
found at the casinos can be broken into two general categories: 
big room and lounge.
The big rooms can house over a thousand people and 
usually have top notch stars performing there. However, these 
shows usually run about $40 or so and it's pretty hard to get 
tickets unless you're a guest at the hotel. But if you're lucky and 
make reservations one or two days in advance you might be 
able to get in a big room.
The lounges are much smaller and more intimate than the 
big rooms and offer fairly good entertainment. Most of the 
lounge acts consist of live music, dancing, or a well-known 
performer. The usual cost to watch lounge entertainment is a 
drink minimum; shows are performed 24 hours a day.
More traditional forms of entertainment, such as movies, 
can be found close by to the casinos and hotels. If you travel 
around ten miles down Route 40, past all the cheap motels, 
you'll eventually come to a huge shopping mall and a movie 
complex that houses 16 theaters. It's usually a safe bet that you 
can find something to see there.
To find even more entertainment, you should also check 
out the local free weeklies The Sun and Whoot, as well as any 
literature the casinos have.
When it comes to eating in Atlantic City, your choices are 
even more plentiful than the entertainment. Each casino has at 
least six different restaurants, as well as several smaller cafes 
and snack bars; Probably the best two places to find food are 
the food court in Ocean One and the Sands Hotel-Casino. Both 
offer just about every type of culinary choice at their food 
courts, and all at reasonable prices.
Finally, don't forget one of the main attractions to be found 
in Atlantic City — the beach. The casinos, as well as the local 
police force, keep the beaches sparkling clean, making them 
ideal for sunbathing. The best time of year to go down and do a 
little sunning is during the basic summer months, May to 
August. However, if you happen to miss the optimal season, 
having the beach nearby makes for nice breezes and cool 
weather all year.
So, if you're planning on heading down to the Boardwalk, 
make sure to pack your swim trunks, your Monopoly board, 
and money. Lots and lots of money, because no matter what 
your friends, the ads, and the casinos tell you, your pockets are 
always lighter on the way back home.

Atlantic City offers a wide range of shops and entertainment, and for those over 21, casinos.

How TO GET THERE:
Take 279 north into 1-79, then follow 1-79 north to the 
junction with 1-90. Go east on 1-90, which becomes 
the N.Y. State Thruway. Get off at exit 5B, take 1-90 
West. Follow that through Buffalo, over Grand Is­
land, and into Niagara Falls. Get off at the Robert 
Moses Parkway West, which takes you right to the 
falls.

Alison Green/Tartan Asst. Magazine Editor 
On the American side of Niagara Fails, the passengers aboard the Maid of the Mist enjoy a view of the 
base of the American Falls before turning away and entering the basin of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls.
I leaned over the rail, letting the mist from the Falls soak 
my face. About 180 feet below, I could see the base of the 
American Falls and a boatload of people headed straight for it. 
Two weekends ago, I spent the weekend in Buffalo, and took a 
day trip to Niagara Falls. Although a five-hour trip from 
Pittsburgh to the Falls might seem pointless, there's a lot to do 
while you're there.
Niagara Falls is the oldest state park in the United States. It 
was established back in 1885, and it has attracted visitors from 
all over the world ever since. Niagara Falls is divided into two 
sections: the American Falls and the Canadian Horseshoe Falls. 
There's an ongoing argument between people who have been 
to both sides of the Falls about which side is the most beautiful. 
Both falls are visible from the American side, but if you have 
the time, see both sides.
Opportunities to get closer to the action make the Falls 
different from other state parks: every fifteen minutes, a boat 
called the Maid of the Mist sails to the base of the American Falls 
and into the basin of the Horseshoe Falls. If you don't mind 
getting drenched — and believe me, if you can see the guard­
rails, you're already wet — you can't leave the Falls without 
riding it. Right now the ride costs $6.50 per adult, but the 
prices are subject to change. If you want a closer look without 
getting wet, take a helicopter ride over the Falls. It's only $25 
per person, and the helicopters have turbine engines, which 
make them a little quieter than usual.
The American side of the Falls has an aquarium, an artists' 
market and gallery, and a museum of Native American art. The 
Aquarium of Niagara Falls has over forty exhibits, and the 
Artisans' Alley exhibits and sells the work of more than six 
hundred American craftsmen and artists. The Native American 
Center for the Living Arts, also known as "The Turtle," spon­
sors Native American craft shows and plays in addition to the 
Native American art collections in the gallery.
The Canadian side of the Falls has another aquarium, the 
Minolta and Skylon Towers, and lots of museums. Marineland, 
an aquarium which resembles Sea World more than you might 
expect, is open all year long, although the shows are seasonal. 
The Minolta and Skylon Towers offer an excellent view of the 
Falls and the surrounding area. Among the museums are the 
Guinness World of Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum, 
Tussaud's Wax Museum and — hold your breath — the new 
Elvis Presley museum.
As the saying goes, the best place to stay in New York is 
with a friend. It's intended for people traveling to New York 
City, but it's easily applicable here. Whether you stay on the 
American or Canadian side of the Falls, expect to pay tourist- 
oriented prices at the local hotels. Besides, you're bound to 
spend more of your time in nearby Buffalo and Toronto.

If you'd like to "shop til you drop" at bargain basement 
prices and catch a bit of history while you're at it, then Reading 
(pronounced "Red-ing") is the place for you.
An Outlet Haven
Nestled in Eastern Pennsylvania in Berks County, the city 
of Reading is "the outlet capital of the world." With over 250 
outlet stores ranging from fashions to furniture, cosmetics to 
tableware, Reading is sure to satisfy the needs of everyone from 
the average shopper to the shopping connoisseur.
The outlet stores located throughout the city can be a 
shopper's paradise, but be warned that not all of the merchan­
dise is first quality. Some of the merchandise might be slightly 
irregular but with careful inspection, you can get unbelievable 
bargains. Brand names run rampant throughout the outlets and 
discounts can go as high as 80 percent. And remember, there's 
no tax on clothes in Pennsylvania.
The Reading Outlet Center, located at 801 North 9th Street, 
is the largest outlet center, with over 70 individual stores 
housed in several buildings within two blocks. There you'll 
find such brand names as Jaeger, Liz Claiborne, London Fog, 
Polo/Ralph Lauren, and Levi Strauss. It's open on Fridays and 
Saturdays from 9 am to 6 pm, on Sundays from noon to 5 pm, 
and on Mondays from 9 am to 6 pm.
On the northern edge of Reading, you'll find Heisters Lane 
Complex, 800 Heisters Lane, Kutztown Road. This ten-outlet 
center within three buildings features Talbott, Mikasa, 
Burlington Coat and an All-in-One Linen outlet including 
Fieldcrest, Cannon, Springmaid, and Laura Ashley. The com­
plex is open on Fridays and Saturdays from 9 am to 8 pm, on 
Sundays from 11 am to 5 pm, and on Mondays from 9:30 am 
until 5 pm.
The oldest complex is the VF Factory Outlet Complex, 
located on Hill Avenue and Park Road in the Wyomissing area. 
Housed in eight buildings are 40 outlet stores including Lee 
Jeans, L.L. Bean, Vanity Fair lingerie, Totes, and Windsor shirts. 
The VF Factory Outlet Complex is open on Fridays from 9 am 
to 9 pm, on Saturdays from 9 am to 6 pm, on Sundays from 
noon to 5 pm, and on Mondays from 9 am until 9 pm.
Historical Reading
If shopping is not one of your personal favorites, then 
don't worry. There's more to Reading than just outlets. You can 
take a stroll through the core of downtown, Penn Square. 
Reading's first courthouse and the original farmers' market 
stood in Penn Square; thus, originally named Market Square.
Its current name comes from the men who laid out the city in 
1748, founders Thomas and Richard Penn. Today, Penn Square 
is the center of Reading's historical district where you can 
study original Victorian storefronts and 19th century workers' 
homes and commercial structures. A self-guided walking tour 
is available for free from the Berks County Visitors Information 
Association.
Remember the legendary frontiersman Daniel Boone? Well, 
you can visit the Daniel Boone Homestead, where he was born 
in 1734 and lived until 1750. The Homestead gives visitors a 
taste of 18th century farm furniture and a chance to view 
Daniel Boone's memorabilia. It includes a sawmill, barn picnic 
areas, nature trails, and a lake, all on 579 acres of land. It's 
located on Daniel Boone Road, Birdsboro, off Route 422. It's 
open on Fridays and Saturdays from 9 am to 5 pm; and on 
Sundays from noon to 5 pm. Admission is free but a guided 
tour through the house is $1.50.
After visiting the Daniel Boone Homestead, go back in time 
and get a view of Pennsylvania's countryside by riding the Blue 
Mountain and Reading Railroad. On a steam-era locomotive, 
you can travel an hour and a half over 26 miles between South 
Hamburg and Temple, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania

countryside is particularly 
beautiful now with the turning 
fall leaves. You can board the 
train at either South Hamburg 
Station, which is situated on 
Route 61 one mile south of Exit 
9A off Interstate 78, or Temple 
Station, which is located two 
miles north of Reading on 
Tuckerton Road between Routes 
61 and 222. Call the Blue Moun­
tain and Reading Railroad for a 
list of departure times.
For a panoramic view of Reading, go up to the summit of 
Mount Penn to the Pagoda. The Pagoda, on Duryea Drive and 
Skyline Boulevard, is a seven story Japanese-style tower. The 
610 foot Pagoda was built of red brick and tile in 1908 by a local 
businessman, William Witman. The Pagoda houses an authen­
tic 1739 temple bell from Obama, Japan and is the only Japa­
nese pagoda east of California. Additional features include a 
collection of Japanese cherry trees, an Oriental bridge and a 
bonsai island. This unique feature of Reading is open everyday 
from noon to 9 pm and admission is only a quarter.
Finally, if you're not worn out from the day, try some of 
Reading's cultural activities. Perhaps an opera at Berks County 
Opera will soothe those tired feet. Not interested in opera?
Well, you can sing along with the Reading Civic Opera Society 
as they entertain you with a musical. Contact the Berks County 
Visitors Association for more information.
For maps and travel data about Reading, outlet shopping, 
and other attractions of the area, contact: The Berks County 
Visitors Information Association, Sheraton Berkshire, Route 422 
West, Paper Mill Road Exit, Wyomissing, PA 19610 or call (215) 
375-4085 during the hours of 9 am to 5 pm on Mondays 
through Fridays; and 9 am to 1 pm on Saturdays.
Put on some comfortable walking shoes, grab your wallet 
and head out for Reading, Pennsylvania.

It may not be skiing season yet, but you can still go to Seven 
Springs, Pennsylvania. It isn't a very long ride.
Grab a friend or significant other and, for $308, get a double room 
for two nights. Two breakfasts and one buffet dinner are also included. 
In addition, you get free roam of the indoor pool, health spa, racquet- 
ball, and tennis facilities.
If you want to do more or just go up for the day, there are other 
activities going on. Seven Springs has an 18 hole golf course, a driving 
range, and a miniture golf course. It also offers organized events such 
as hiking and nature walks. Finally, it DOES have a bar for those over 
21 where you can hang out, eat, drink, and be merry.
In October and November only, it has Autumn Fest Sundays.
There is an outdoor buffet and entertainment (usually a Country- 
Western band or a four piece band.)
To get more information, such as a brochure, or to make your 
reservation, you can call (814) 352-7777. Enjoy the stay!

Gettysburg is the prescription for those looking to escape 
the chaos of classes and the noise of Pittsburgh. This small 
Pennsylvanian town is tucked into fields made famous by the 
Civil War.
Mid-semester break is the perfect time to go because it falls 
on one of the two weekends of the Apple Harvest. The town 
springs to life with a huge craft show. You can buy crafts hand 
made by local artisans. And, of course, you can buy apples. 
Apple cider, apple pie and other apple goodies, buckets, even 
bushels, of apples.
Even if the Apple Harvest keeps you busy, find time to take 
a tour of the battlefields. I highly recommend doing it on 
horseback. Historical horseback riding tours are outrageously 
overpriced at $60 a ride, but they give a detailed description of 
what happened in the fields as you ride through them. How­
ever, a simple ride through the battlefields is only $15 and well 
worth it. If you get lucky, like I did, your guide might tell your 
group the civil war stories anyway. By October, the weather 
might be touch and go, but, if you catch a nice day it's worth it.
You can also take a two hour bus tour of the battlefields for 
$9.75. Gettysburg Tour Center runs these throughout the day 
and their number is (717) 334-6296.
If you don't want to be quite that touristy, the National 
Park Service give tourists two options. You can stop by and 
pick up a free map guide with the highlights of the battlefields. 
Some of these include, Little Round Top/Big Round Top and 
the National Cemetery on the south side of town and the Peace 
Light Memorial, located on the other side of town, north of 
Gettysburg College.
Another way to see the battlefields is to hire a historical 
guide who will sit with you in your car and tell you about the 
fields as you drive through them. This costs $17 per car. For 
more information, call (717) 334 1124.
Among the museums that dot the town are a civil war wax 
museum and several war hospitals that have been converted.
On the outskirts of Gettysburg you'll find Eisenhower's farm, 
the farm house he lived in after his presidency.
For some good food at the end of the day, try the Ginger­
bread man on Steinweir Ave. It's a 
casual Bennigan's type place.
Right down the road is the 
slightly more expensive Dobbin 
House. This converted farm house 
used to be home to Reverend 
Dobbin. The Reverend helped out 
many a runaway slave. The Plaza 
and J.D.'s Pub are two more 
casual places to eat, located in the 
center circle of town.
Everything in Gettysburg is 
easy enough to find; simply drive 
to the center of town and look for 
signs. It's not that big a place.

How TO GET THERE:
Take 1-376 east to the Pennsylvania

exit 17. Get on Route 15 south. Take 
the Hunterstown Rd. exit, and make

miles and make a left onto Carlisle

"What?" cries the collective. "Isn't CMU roughing it 
enough already?" Seriously, camping is a good way to recharge 
yourself and get ready for coming back and facing the rest of 
the semester. A few days of sleeping out in the open, cooking 
food over a fire, and staring at trees, can definitely offer you a 
new perspective.
Don't let roughing it scare you away; the campgrounds 
listed here offer campers some of the basic necessities that 
simply sleeping in the woods can't offer. The following 
campgrounda are all under two hours driving distance from 
Pittsburgh.
Bear Run Campgrounds: The campgrounds have hiking 
trails, biking trails, fishing, a heated pool, a recreation hall, and 
canoe rentals. That should be plenty to keep campers busy.
Bear Run closes at the end of October and reopens in mid- 
April. The cost is $12 a night for two people who are tenting; 
with an electric hookup, it is $4 extra for each person. They also 
have cabins; four adults with electricity and water would pay 
$35. To save a spot, Bear Run likes campers to make reserva­
tions at least a week ahead of time. For further information, call 
368-3564.
Five Pines Camping and Recreation: Throughout the 300 
acres of the park are hiking and bike trails. The campgrounds 
are also located near a lake where trout fishing is popular. The
campgrounds have hot showers and hot and cold running 
water. You can even arrange to have firewood delivered to 
your campsite. Five Pines closes in October. It's $6 per person a 
night. Electricity is extra. Five Pines likes to have reservations
30 days in advance, if something unforeseen happens, like a 
blizzard on the day you had your reservations, they will give 
you a refund. For further information, call 329-4606.
Fox Den Acres: Fox Den facilities have showers, along with 
hot and cold running water. Fox Den Acres has hiking and bike 
trails. Fox Den closes November 1 and opens again on the first 
of May. A complete hookup is $15 for two people, while tenting 
for two people is $12 a night. You usually don't need to make 
reservations, unless you are planning to come up during a 
holiday, for which they recommend making reservations 30 
days in advance. For further information, call 925-7054.
Rose Point Park: The camp is located near Slippery Rock, 
and has, in addition to its many biking and hiking trails, white 
water rafting. It also has a recreation hall with a pool table and 
pinball machines. From time to time, it has special presenta­
tions. Rose Point also has showers, hot and cold running water, 
and is open year round. Tenting is $9 for two adults. Reserva­
tions usually need to be made a week in advance. For further 
information, call 924-2415.

There's an alternative to Architect's Leap, and while it's not 
as convenient, it's much more pleasant. It's not just for survi­
vors of the Architecture program, either — the visit is enjoyable 
for students of all majors. It's one of America's most famous 
architectural museums and is only an hour away from Pitts­
burgh; its mountain location makes for a relaxing day. The 
dream destination is Fallingwater.
Fallingwater was designed in 1936 by Frank Lloyd Wright, 
one of the greatest American architects of this century, as a 
home for the Kaufmann family of Pittsburgh (as in Kaufmann's 
Department Store). Members of the family lived in the home 
intermittently until a few years ago, when they generously 
donated it to the public.
Taking a tour of Fallingwater is a bit different from what 
you might expect. There are no velvet cords or plastic cases as 
in many museums, so it's like walking through someone's 
house. But what a house! It's famous because Frank Lloyd 
Wright designed it to fit harmoniously into the mountain and 
forest surroundings. It is built of mountain rock excavated 
nearby, which blends with the natural stone. But 
Fallingwater's most unusual feature is that it's built above a 
stream. Steps lead from the living room directly down to the 
water, which soon after tumbles over a waterfall.
Other unique features of the house are floors cut directly 
from the rock, and strangely enough, no curtains, even in the 
bathrooms. (Wright apparently thought that curtains were 
unnatural, and since there are no neighbors for miles around 
the heavily-wooded estate, he convinced the Kaufmanns to do 
without them.)
Fallingwater is south-east of Pittsburgh, near Ohiopyle. It's 
open from Tuesday through Sunday, 10 am to 4 pm until mid- 
November. Reservations are advised. To make them, or to get 
directions from CMU, call 329-8501. And if for some reason 
you can't get away but you want to enjoy the spirit of Frank 
Lloyd Wright, there are some lovely original Wright designs in 
the Architectural Archives of Hunt Library.

Most of us have been intrigued by white water rafting at 
some time or another, but few have actually gone out to brave 
the rapids. Well, you no longer have an excuse not to go, 
because as Chris at Wild Water Unlimited says, "It's safer than 
driving a car." Experienced guides lead each group and pro­
vide all the necessary safety equipment at this rafting run 
located in Thurmond, West Virginia.
All the happy rafter has to bring is his or her personal gear 
which should include something that stays warm when wet.
Believe it or not, this does exist. Clothing made from wool and 
polyzorbane does the trick. You don't even have to be a swim­
mer, as long as you're not deathly afraid of water. On the other 
hand, being afraid of twenty foot waves is permissible.
If you can handle the thought of the waves, you'll 
definitely be able to deal with the price. There are a couple of 
different packages to choose from a one-day trip for $80 to a 
two-day trip for $200. There are five different group levels to 
choose from.
On a typical Saturday, about 140 people raft down the river 
and are bused back up to their cars. The overwhelming consen­
sus of the rapid riders is that nothing beats a natural roller 
coaster. For more information, call Wild Water Unlimited at

You roll down your car window to let the aromatic scent of 
pure milk chocolate waft in and taunt your senses. You park by 
a chocolate kiss lamppost and are greeted by giant, smiling 
chocolate candies that lead you into a large, chocolate-colored 
building. Are you dreaming? No, you've simply just arrived at 
your very first stop in Chocolate Town, U.S.A., the Hershey 
Chocolate World visitors center in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
When you first arrive at the visitor's center, which is free 
and open daily from 9 am to 4:45 pm, sit back, relax, and enjoy 
a trolley ride through the Chocolate World's simulated choco­
late factory tour, which lets you experience the complete 
chocolate-making process, from the cocoa bean to the finished 
product. Chocolate World trolley tours run hourly on the 
weekends, and tickets can be purchased at the visitor's desk.
After taking a trip through the wonderful world of choco­
late-making, you may want to plan your day over breakfast or 
lunch at the Hershey's Cafe Restaurant, finishing it off with a 
bit of indulgence at the Chocolate Fantasy Dessert Bar. Then, if 
you wish, do some souvenir shopping at any of the ten Choco­
late World shops. Next, make sure you purchase tickets, ask for 
directions, make reservations, and do anything else you need to 
do at the visitor's desk. At last, you're ready to start your 
exiting day or weekend seeing the sights of Hershey.
For botanical enthusiasts, Hershey Gardens offers a splen­
did display of flowers, trees, and shrubs. In addition to the 
year-round display of hollies, Japanese maples, giant sequoias, 
and theme gardens, October offers a seasonal display of late- 
season rose bloom and chrysanthemums. Hershey Gardens is 
open daily 9 am to 5 pm; admission is $3.50 for visitors over 18 
and $1 for visitors 18 and under.
For those who would rather explore the deep realms of 
underground caverns, Indian Echo Caverns is for you. Learn 
about the history of explorers who first found their way 
through these passages, as you enjoy a 45-minute guided tour 
through the world of stalagmites, stalactites, columns, flow- 
stone, and lakes. Your tour is made comfortable with electri­
cally-lit, level pathways and stairs. Indian Echo Caverns is open 
daily, 10 am-4 pm; admission is $6. Directions to the caverns are 
simple: Take Route 322 West to Hummelstown/Middletown 
exit and follow the signs. The caverns are four miles from 
Hershey.
How TO GET THERE:
Take the Pennsylvania Turnpike east to Route 322, 
also heading east. The signs for Hershey are really 
hard to miss.
4 HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
If exploring the deep realms of underground caverns just 
isn't for you, perhaps exploring the realms of history is more to 
your liking. Just a short walk from the Chocolate World 
visitor's center, the Hershey Museum of American Life offers a 
look into Hershey's rich heritage and America's illustrious past. 
A multitude of exhibits, which include antique furniture, china, 
musical instruments, native American artifacts, and even Mr. 
Hershey's search for a successful chocolate formula, all can be 
found in the museum. Feeling juvenile? Go play in the 
Children's Area, complete with a life-size tepee that invites you 
to be an American Indian for a day (tell them you're very big 
for your age). The museum is open daily 10 am-5 pm; admission 
is $3.50 for visitors over 18 and $1.25 for visitors 18 and under.
Tired of being cooped up inside stuffy buildings with lots 
of people? Get out! Go visit animals in authentic, natural 
environments at ZooAmerica. Lunch with a gator, hang out 
with a chimp, or have a nice talk with a polar bear. Whatever 
your favorite beast, you're sure to find it at ZooAmerica, which 
has over 200 animals of 75 different species. ZooAmerica opens 
daily at 10 am; admission is $3.50.
Whether you feel like staying outdoors or are too cheap to 
stay at a hotel, Hershey Highmeadow Camp offers 260 camp­
sites on 55 open and shaded acres. A laundry, a grocery and 
supply store, and a game room are among the facilities avail­
able on the campgrounds. Rates are (daily, group of 4): no 
hookup-$19, electric-$20.50, electric and water-$21.25, and 
electricity/water/sewer-$23.75. Reservations are recom­
mended.

Homecoming offered activities
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Features Editor
This past weekend, the campus community welcomed former graduates and their 
friends and families to campus to celebrate Homecoming. The Alumni Office, doubling as 
the site of Homecoming Headquarters, planned many events for all of them to enjoy and 
take part in.
On Friday, October 1, from 3 -5 pm, The Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, 
Engineering and Public Policy, Elecrical and Computer Engineering, Margaret Morrison 
Media Center, Material Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering Depart­
ments all hosted receptions in their specific locations. Then from 4:30 — 6:00 pm, the 
classes of 1943 and 1948 held cocktail receptions in the Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland. 
Old friends and classmates assembled there simply to reminisce and enjoy each other’s 
company. Then from 5:30 — 10:00 pm, alumni were encouraged to stay for dinner and then 
enjoy an evening of music by the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic conducted by Juan Pablo 
Izquierdo. The concert also featured faculty artist Earl Wild, an internationally acclaimed 
piano soloist.
On Saturday, the events provided were every bit as enjoyable. A college breakfast was 
given in Skibo from 8-10 am for alumni to talk and eat with departmental heads. Then a 
pre- and post-law school reception was given at 9:30 am. The reception served as an 
opportunity for alumni and undergraduates, who are considering attending law school, to 
discuss options and plans. Then at 10 am, there was a modern languages open house in 
Baker Hall.
From 9-10:30 am, alumni had their choice of attending one of three seminars. “New ways 
to Study Emotion: Humanistic and Scientific Approaches” was given by Peter Steams, 
dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and Margaret Clark, professor of 
psychology. The lecture was said to be a lively and entertaining discussion pertaining to 
human emotion. Also featured was a lecture by John Modell, associate department head

Clippership dance successful despite rain
3y KATHY WRIGHT
tartan Staffwriter
Having a Homecoming 
Dance on a Clippership cruise 
has been a tradition here at 
3MU for over 25 years. Every 
fear, 250 to 300 people, con- 
iistingmostly offreshmen and 
seniors, attend this affair.
“The freshmen want to go, 
because it’s their first year 
here, and the seniors go, be­
cause it’s their last,” says 
Karen Grunberg, sophomore 
social and decision sciences 
major, and the programming 
chair for SDC, which spon­
sored this event.
When the tickets first went 
on sale, very few people were 
buying them. “There’s no way 
this could not happen ... it’s 
tradition,” says Grunberg of 
her initial worries, but as the 
date of departure neared, 
ticket sales rose.
This year was on par with 
previous years, with nearly 
300 people attending. Even 
the rain did not prevent m any 
¡people from buying tickets on 
^Saturday, and luckily the 
weather cleared before the 
¡evening fun began.
“The only people who do go 
are people who want to have 
' says Grunberg, which
seemed to be the case. The 
people on the dance floor had a 
blast, wrapped up in their own 
worlds of rocking and swaying, 
pseudo street dancing, and, 
yes, even break dancing. Most 
couples danced to their own 
rhythms, ignoring the music 
altogether, which was probably 
a wise choice considering the
mix of ’90s _________________

back mu­
sic, and 
even some

’70s favor­
ites, like 
“YMCA,” 
inter­
mingled,
of course, --------------------------
with only 
the sappi­
est of love songs.
“This is pretty cool. I’m hav­
ing a good time,” said Matt 
Drowns, an MCS transfer stu­
dent, as he was taking a break 
from the evening’s activities 
by just relaxing with his date, 
Patsy Haranda. Haranda,who 
is not from CMU, agreed by 
saying, “I’m having a lot of fun.”
Several freshman women 
from the third floor of Donner 
came together as a group and
had a great time talking and 
dancing the evening away, al­
though Lali Longnecker, an 
H&SS freshman, “Thought it 
would be bigger.” She had ex­
pected that more people would 
come to this special Homecom­
ing event but then admitted that 
“13 dollars is a lot for one per-
“The freshmen want to go, because 
it's their first year here, and the se­
niors go, because it’s their last.”
— Karen Grunberg 
SDC Programming Chair
Beth Franklin, also an H&SS 
freshman, “thought it was good 
we had it here” on the Partyliner 
as opposed to a decorated gym. 
For this reason alone, Franklin 
thought it was worth the price 
to have such a nice atmosphere 
and view of Pittsburgh, but was 
a bit irritated to find that there 
was “no food” included in the 
fare, beyond pretzels and po­
tato chips. Other hot food was 
available for a charge.
SDC caught everybody’s at­
tention this year by proudly 
boasting SEX in bright red let­
ters on one post of the fence 
advertising the dance, raising 
many an eyebrow and maybe 
even raising a few hopes.
Though I could not bring my­
self to ask, by the end of the 
evening it was quite easy to see
______________ who was and
who wasn’t 
going to live 
up to this 
promise. Sev­
eral couples 
were so hot 
and heavy on 
the dancefloor 
that I was 
wondering if 
something
---------------------- was going to
happen right 
there. Walk­
ing on the outside decks was 
not for those who wanted to 
enjoy the view of Pittsburgh, 
but reserved more for those who 
wantedto make out in the freez­
ing cold. Yes, there seemed to 
be quite a sexual feel this year 
on the Partyliner. People were 
probably trying to generate 
some body heat.
I even overheard several 
misinformed, but nice women

Little windows, answering machines are people, too
Askew, No Shoes
By Matt Messner
Greetings literary connois- 
, >'seurs, and welcome once again to 
! I '"the little achromatic two-dimen- 
! sional world I like to call my col- 
I Oimn. I am pleased to announce 
¦that a second brave soul is now on 
; record as reading this column. (It
• -is more often the case for people 
; 4o approach me in some dark se- 
| .»eluded comer ofthe campus. Eyes 
j --fixed straight ahead, they whis­
ker, “I read your column,” with- 
1 '6ut a shudder of external ac-

• soul wishes to remain anonymous 
; -(surprised?), but let us count him 
| 'amongst the scarcity of verified 
J 'readers all the same.
! It has recently been brought to
1 my attention that CMU may be
hiding more lilliputian portals 
than anyone previously imagined. 
It would appear that the UCC 
skinny-door is not the only such 
anomaly to be found on 
campus. Anyone coura­
geous enough to confront 
Highlander food on a regu­
lar basis will no doubt be 
aware of the existence of 
the “Little Windows 
Room.” Yes, that word is 
plural. Within this off­
shoot of the main dining 
area, a small number of 
diminutive windows may 
be detected by the careful 
observer.
They are nearly equal 
(accuracy ±4 percent) to 
the famed narrow door in 
cuteness. The same people 
who believe that the fed­
eral government is se­
cretly studying space 
aliens have informed me 
that CMU architecture 0ne of 
students are under grant 
to analyze the specific character­
istics of alien structures and see 
how they react within our envi­
ronment. We now interrupt this
paragraph to bring you a public 
service announcement:

regard as to what they are doing.
With every passage they make, 
they abruptly displace the fragile 
innards of the doorway through
which they pass. Doorways are 
by nature passive creatures, ex­
isting of select air molecules held 
within a non-sequiturous field. It 
is about time they are 
paid the respect they de­
serve. People do not walk 
through doors (sober, 
anyhow); people walk 
through doorways. Next 
time you have some­
where to go, visualize a 
bowling ball traveling 
through your alimentary 
canal. Be gentle. Door­
ways are people, too.
Gratuitous telephone- 
related paragraph: Tele­
phone etiquette is rap­
idly decaying in modem 
society. People hang-up 
on answering machines 
without any regard to the 
feelings of the machine 
or its user. Not liking an­
swering machines is no 
excuse. Simply say, after 
the tone (of course), “I 
don’t like answering machines 
and therefore will not leave a 
message.” I personally often pre­
fer talking to silicon-based life
forms over their carbon-based 
counterparts. When misdialing 
numbers I will always leave my 
name, number, the time of day, 
and a short message explaining 
that I have not the slightest clue 
who they are but they are always 
welcome to miscall me up some 
time. Oddly enough, they never 
do.
Shameless paragraph condon­
ing lateness: Arriving at class 
uncomposed is analogous to ar­
riving late. If you are not in the 
proper mind set you cannot leam. 
This is why I suggest everyone 
leave for class right after their 
clocks have ticked past the last 
chance they think they have to 
arrive on time.
Forced into this situation, one 
necessarily races full speed to 
class, arriving clear, composed, 
and out of breath. The entire trip 
was the epitome of mental focus, 
thoughts drifting little from that 
of the commencing lecture.
Now, if a student were to leave 
with ample time to arrive, she 
would undoubtedly waste emo­
tional energy trying to walk 
slowly enough to arrive at a rea­
sonable time. She would most 
likely be forced to scan the bull, 
tin boards for posters she had^( 
seen and observe the intricacies 
of the architecture. Once at class 
she would find it hard to conceit 
trate due to the bombardment of 
nontopic-related material he^ 
mind had just received.
Thus, I hope you now realize 
that it is far too stressful to have 
to walk slowly to class. I will 
perpetually opt for the Zen 
tal and physical exercise of the 
contest with the clock. Wanni 
race?
Matt Messner, CIT freshman, 
(mmdm), feels comfortable view-

Sidewalks, stairs, elevators promote embarrassment, law suits
1 itiHorror Stories
By Tom Harper
\ v' I used to look down whenever I walked 
: : ^because there wasn’t much to look at — 
I ^same old streets, sidewalks, trees, and 
; other stuff.
• ! Now, I look down whenever I walk 
j because of necessity. If I’m not real care- 
“ Tul, I’ll end up tripping over a part of the 
sidewalk. I almost gave myself a concus- 
:*!^sion walking near Kiltie Court. Watch it 
•‘[^around there!I
It’s kind of hard to explain how I can 
trip over the sidewalk. My shoes are 
always tied, I always remember to alter­
nate feet, and I’m not charging though 
crowds at speeds exceeding 90 miles per 
hour.
You can trip over the sidewalk where 
two sections of concrete meet. Some 
places, such as Kiltie, have uneven sec­
tions. It’s real hard to see unless you 
completely focus on the sidewalk. If you 
put your foot down where two uneven 
sections of sidewalk meet, down you go, 
unless you have quick reflexes and re­
cover before you pass the pivotal angle 
where you’re heading for the concrete at 
an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second 
squared. (For the physics illiterate, that’s 
gravity!)
The places to watch out for this are — 
Forbes Avenue in front of Morewood
Gardens, Kiltie Court, and in front of 
Donner Hall.
Step on a crack, break your own back!
The other thing I’m trying to get used 
to here at CMU are the various sizes of 
stairs. For eighteen years I’ve known 
only two sizes of stairs—big (my house) 
and little (school). I’m also one of those 
people that walks up two or three steps 
at a time.
CMU stairs come in many different 
sizes. There’s short and wide stairs in 
most lecture halls. Look at the stairs in 
Doherty 2210. They’re about a half-inch 
thick and a foot wide. I almost always 
trip on one of them if I’m not looking.
CMU “normal” steps are about two 
inches high. That’s about the height of 
the “school” steps which have been drilled 
into my memory throughout my tenure 
in Pennsylvania’s public school system.
This size of steps are found out in the 
open in academic buildings. In Wean 
Hall, the stairs are hidden — and they 
are huge compared to Doherty’s, which 
are out in the open. Be careful in Wean 
—that piece of the railing that sticks up 
into the air at about eye-level is still 
there.
In most dorms, steps are a few eighths 
of an inch higher than Doherty’s. Skibo 
has various sizes of stairs, outside and 
inside. Coupled with the threat of those 
killer uneven sections of sidewalks, this 
could lead to a very nasty lawsuit by a 
disgruntled student in the near future.
From the looks of this article, it seems 
elevators are the way to go. Just hope 
you don’t get stuck in one. In a vast 
majority of elevators, the emergency 
phone cubbyhole holds wads of gum and 
empty cans of Mountain Dew, but no
phone. Various profound messages are 
scribed onto the walls of most elevator; 
on campus — about two of which are 
printable in this paper.
I have also noticed that in Hamburg 
Hall there is a big grate where, as every 
sitcom watcher knows, there should be a 
ceiling with a trap door leading to the 
shaft.
Afinal tip for anybody who has classes 
in the Cathedral of Learning — don’t 
hesitate to use the handicapped eleva­
tor. If you’re caught, don’t panic. Just 
tell them what I tell them—your handj. 
cap doesn’t show because it’s mental, 
and very dangerous!
Tom Harper, MCS freshman, is now 
trying to get a handicapped parking spaci 
on campus, citing the above reasonsfoi 
its use.
Americans blessed with clean, safe waiting rooms in health services
Alien in Residence
By Micki Kochanskyj
There are two things which can 
be relied upon with a fair degree 
of certainty to occur in October:
1) Things start falling from the 
sky—buckeyes, leaves, rain, etc. 
— and you know fall has arrived.
2) Classes become very, very 
small. The reason behind the first 
surety is a cruel act of nature 
which mankind is utterly power­
less to stop. The reason behind 
the second phenomenon is also a 
cruel act of nature which man­
kind is utterly powerless to stop 
—your classmates all have colds.
Yes, cold and flu season is here 
again, and let’s face it, unless 
you’re not ofthis earth, the runny 
nose, aches, and fever will get
you too. Sure, the really macho or 
incredibly busy will endure a pe­
riod of acute denial for a while, 
but sooner or later, the medical 
evidence becomes just too darn 
obvious to ignore. That’s the day 
when even the most dedicated 
among us wake up and say, “I 
don’t care if I fail every class 
I’m taking — I’m not going in 
today.”
I, for one, don’t have a cold. 
Okay, my nose is a relentless 
stream of mucus, and my head 
throbs like a jackhammer, and 
I feel like I’m about 105 degrees 
warm. I shouldn’t be at home 
tucked up in bed with a steam­
ing bowl of homemade chicken 
soup in my hands. Hey, I’m one of 
the above-mentioned dedicated 
people and well, I just can’t take 
time off ever, no matter what. I 
was on the verge of giving up and 
going home today (mmm, chicken 
soup) when a friend suggested I 
try the Health Center. “Why?” I 
asked. “What could they possibly 
do for me? I don’t have a cold, 
which as you know, mankind is
utterly powerless to stop.”
“They have paper cups filled 
with free cold remedy goodies,” 
my friend said, and my interest 
was piqued. Actually, a good 
strong dose of Dayquil sounded 
pretty good right then. Not, of
door that separates you from the 
elements. A water fountain. A 
bathroom. A TV. Not so very dif­
ferent from any medical estab- 
lishmentwaitingroom, youmight 
say. And that’s exactly it. All 
waiting rooms are not alike — at
Once I got bled on by an injured per­
son, squeezed next to me on the only 
available seat There is no water foun­
tain, no magazines, certainly no TV.
Prof. enlightens audience
course, that I had a cold, or any­
thing. “Well, OK,” I said, “just 
point me in the right direction 
and give me a push.”
I went. And you know what? It 
made me feel a whole lot better. I 
began to notice things, little 
things—things people might take 
for granted and never fully ap­
preciate.
I sawrecentmagazines stacked 
on a table by comfortable seats. A
least not where I’m from.
In England, healthcare is 
mostly free (You pay a minimal 
flat rate fee for medicine, etc.). 
What this means is that you aren’t 
anyone’s customer. The doctors 
and nurses have nothing at stake 
in terms of their attitude toward 
you. The hospital emergency room 
is simply a holding area for in­
coming wounded, with no conces­
sions to patient’s comfort what­
soever. You have no choice. If you 
don’t like it, there is nowhere else 
you can go. (Unless you are rich 
and have private healthcare, but 
that’s another story.)
My local emergency room, for 
example consisted of rows of plas­
tic bucket seats placed right next 
to each other in a totally bare hall 
with a gaping hole the size of an 
ambulance in the wall. I spent 
many an hour (the average wait 
before getting to see a doctor is 
four hours) avoiding eye-contact 
with homeless people for which 
the waiting room was a popular 
hangout. They frequently got rau­
cous (they were drinking) and 
had to be muscled out by interns, 
only to return through the gap­
ing hole minutes later. Once I got 
bled on by an injured person, 
squeezed next to me on the only 
available seat. There is no water 
fountain, nomagazines, certainly 
no TV.
If this sounds like something 
out of a horror story, it is. The 
British people were shocked 
when, after breaking his arm in a
polo accident, Prince Charles,1 ip 
a public-relations “stunt” con. 
ceded to wait for treatment along

upon leaving several hours later 
belied more than the pain he felt 
from his rather nasty injury.
Compared with the best mj 
country has to offer in terms of 
public health facilities, the 
Carnegie Mellon Health Services 
center is a palace. And it’s ju^t 
college facility, it’s nothing spe-! 
cial. If having a cold (which 1 
don’t) meant I had to endure the 
prompt and friendly service_sof 
the campus Health Center, it 
wasn’t so bad. It could be worse. 
For my family back home, it W 
worse. I’ll take my paper cup bf 
cold remedy goodies. I may just 
do as the nurse says and go home. 
After all, I do have a cold.

; adjust.
Hugh and his wife, Alice, have 
; had many encounters during 
; their travels. Both being nature 
! lovers, the Young’s misundersood 
i this new depreciation for natural 
'• wonders, harbored by our increas­
ingly technology-based country. 
They’ve met people who didn’t 
¦ see the beauty in the Grand Can­
yon, and couldn’t realize the se­
renity of mountains and forests.
“These people had leisure 
money and just didn’t know what 
to do with it. It’s kind of sad.” 
Young found it inspiring while 
sitting across from two men on a 
train, who made a positive com- 
' ment on every feature of land 
they passed. Young encourages 
; everyone to have a “long list” of 
¡places to go and things to accom­
plish in life. “We’re the lucky 
ones... the ones with the long 
lists.”
Young, being the perfect non­
athlete in high school, found 
mountain climbing to be an en­
hancing experience both mentally 
and physically. He says, “The to­
tal interdependence and trust 
involved in mountain climbing is 
extremely enriching.”
Young recommends that every­
one finds something that’s worth 
it and works at it with all their 
might. He encourages you to ex­
pand your horizons and follow 
your interests. “You can find an 
adventure if you need it. Bite off 
more than you can chew.”
Young advises that you never 
lose your sense of discovery for 
the outside world, to get involved 
in social and political issues, never 
hesitate to offer concern to oth­
ers, and to love those who seem 
least lovable.
Young hopes that in writing 
his obituary, “You would write 
me as someone with miles to go, 
who loves life, and never lost his 
sense of wonder.”

Newspaper benefit in Shadyside
By TARA ZANE
Assistant Diversions Editor
1!' Carnegie Mellon’s Creative 
Writing Department will be host­
ing a benefit to raise money for 
Radio Transcript Newspaper at 
the SIP coffeehouse in Shadyside 
“’'on Wednesday, October 13 at 8 
"pin. The two hour program, “A 
Literary Evening,” will feature 
; 20 minute readings from speak­
ers including professors Hilary 
Masters, Sharon Dilworth, Jan 
Beatty, plus Radio Transcript 
Newspaper's Fiction Editor, Jen 
’Bannan and more. Due to the
Q-< relaxed nature _______________
" of the night, 
they will be 
sharing humor­
ous pieces of po­
etry and fiction 
'"from their own 
work with the 
audience.
Since four

Newspaper, the Creative Writing 
Department thought that this 
,, reading would be a terrific way to 
publicize the paper and support 
their former students. Publisher 
^-Richard Engel, Editor Erika 
•••^Peterson, and Fiction Editor Jen 
- Bannan all graduated from CMU 
as writing majors in 1991. Editor 
Robert Pfeifer also graduated 
from CMU as an economics and 
history double major in 1988.
Tih Engel and Peterson were un- 
• .able to find jobs writing in Pitts- 
¦ < burgh, so they decided to start 
their own paper with $100 and a 
great deal of foresight. Pitts­
burgh’s lack of a substantial 
monthly publication inspired 
them to fill that void by creating 
Radio Transcript Newspaper 16 
months ago. Engel and Peterson 
then succeeded to persuade their 
former Student Union associates, 
Bannan and Pfeifer, to write and 
edit for the paper.
Radio Transcript Newspaper 
now prides itself as being 
“Pittsburgh’s newest arts and 
politics monthly,” featuring 
“stream-of-consciousness report­
age of, by, and for Pittsburghers.” 
Articles ranging from the politics 
of the upcoming local November
pitched in to buy a keg to have 
beer on tap that evening. In re­
turn, they will request five dollar 
donations at the door and will 
certainly accept generous dona­
tions. In turn, all the money raised 
will be donated to Radio Tran­
script Newspaper.
In hopes that this benefit will 
not only draw more readers to 
Radio Transcript Newspaper, but 
that it may also improve its circu­
lation and possibly solicit more 
businesses’ advertisements. In 
addition, “the evening will cel­
ebrate the idea of creative writ­
ing and the idea of giving to our 
________________ students,” says
"The evening will celebrate the idea 
of creative writing and the idea of 
giving to our students."
— Sharon Dilworth, 
professor of English
elections to social commentary, 
fiction, satire, humor, and car­
toons are included in the publica­
tion. Since Radio Transcript 
Newspaper is free, no profits are 
made. Therefore, Engel person­
ally solicits businesses for fund­
ing through paid advertisements.
These advertisements do help to 
cut expenses, yet the paper still 
must struggles to make ends 
meet.
Easing the financial burden of being published.
Radio Transcript Newspaper is Radio Transcript Newspaper 
subsequently the main objective will also be looking for new jour- 
of this benefit reading. All the nalism interns in January, so 
creative writing professors have mark your calendars!

HOMECOMING, from page LI
'"tod professor of history and so­
cial sciences, entitled, “The U.S. 
Since World War II.” The discus­
sion was about the social, eco­
nomic, and family changes which 
-have occurred since WWII. Fi­
nally, Hugh D. Young, physics 
.-professor, hosted the popular, tra­
ditional lecture, “How to Write a 
Good Obituary.”
Then at 11 am, President Rob­
ert Mehrabian gave the 
President’s Address in Skibo Ball­
room. Mehrabian spoke of the 
: budget, such as how the Univer­
sity spends one million dollars a 
„day, university projects such as 
u the “super computers” and ro- 
. ifeots, and also of the mission of 
i the University in catering to un- 
¦dergraduate needs.
Meharabian told alumni that
Carnegie Mellon will “stick to 
what it does best,” by not ex­
panding into other fields such as 
medicine, or law. He also men­
tioned the University will freeze 
freshman enrollment at 1,200 
students to preserve the quality 
of our undergraduate programs.
At noon, the 55th-plus luncheon 
was hosted for Tech alumni from 
the classes of 1923, 1928, 1933, 
and 1938 to meet and greet old 
friends in Skibo Hall.
GSIA then held a dessert re­
ception from 1-2 pm in the new 
Posner Hall. The Class of 1983 
held their 10-year Reunion from 
1—5 pm, the theme of which was 
entitled, “Changes.”Taking place 
in West Wing, students could 
watch the football game from the 
sidelines while listening to music 
and talking._____________________
At 1:30 pm, alumni classes and 
loyal scots paraded to raise spir­
its for the football game which 
followed at 2 pm. Directly after 
the game was a Kiltie Band Re­
union for former band members 
to play old tunes. An afternoon 
concert, “Words Spoken and Mu­
sic Played,” was held at the Mellon 
Institute Auditorium from 4-6 
pm. That evening was an awards 
ceremony and dinner dance in 
Skibo, and the traditional 
Clippership Dance hosted by the 
Student Dormitory Council for 
students.
On Sunday, October 3, the fes­
tivities were drawn to a close. A 
champagne brunch was held in 
Skibo for the alumni to say their 
final goodbyes and recall their 
favorite memories from when 
they too attended this school.

Daniels feels his book was a 
different kind of book for him to 
write. “Time, Temperature,” 
what Daniels considers to be 
the “heart of the book,” is the
troit, Michigan, called 
upon his upbringing in 
this city to address cur­
rent issues ofurban vio­
lence and economic de­
terioration which still 
challenge many today.
Daniels likes to see 
“sparks and connec­
tions” between poems 
in books, so he worked 
to discover a unifying 
central theme. “When 
you decide it might be 
time to put a book to­
gether, you look to see 
what you have,” says 
Daniels. “You might not 
see it as a book at first 
— you see each poem 
individually. But then 
a theme comes through, 
a connection which 
pulls it all together.”
For Daniels, this con­
necting theme was the Jim Daniels 
issue of urban violence. “What 
happened to me in Detroit has 
stayed with me,” says Daniels. 
“While growing up, I would 
watch them [factory workers] 
come home from work. When I 
worked in the plant myself, I 
began to make connections 
about how work affected their 
home lives, their hearts and 
their minds. It ended up being 
the main subject of the book.”
This experience inDetroitled 
to Daniel’s creation of the char-

problem that I don’t 
think has been dealt 
with in our society. 
The book wasn’t ready 
until that poem was 
done.”
Considering the ex­
plicit nature of the 
book, the language 
Daniels used was also 
more violent than he 
was accustomed to. “I 
was surprised by the 
voice that would come 
out sometimes. ‘Is that 
me?’ I would ask my­
self. It was more harsh 
than I was used to, 
butthe material called 
for it.”
Now Danielsis wait­
ing for reviews. “I feel 
proud of the book right 
now, and hope it does 
well, but like any 
writer, I’m nervous 
about how they will react,” says 
Daniels.
“This might be the last com­
pletely Detroit book, but who 
knows? I’ve made predictions 
in the past that I was done, but
with him after this book.”
Because Daniels’ book touches 
on serious and current issues such 
as economic status, unemploy­
ment, urban violence, and rac­
ism, it is important that the
reader consider the importance they keep coming back.”

Actor’s Theater 
of Louisville, 
Kentucky 
where Kuhn 
performed be­
fore sold-out au­
diences. Kuhn’s 
other stage 
credits include 
Montparnasse 
in Les Miser- 
ables on Broad­
way, and the 
ABC Sports 
Commentator 
in the national
touring act of Chess.
Kuhn said, “Broadway was nice, 
but this [The Accounts] is a better 
script.” The script takes about 90 
minutes to recite and was memo­
rized by Kuhn mostly through 
“fear of humiliation.” Kuhn de­
scribes his one man show as 
“lonely” but enjoys being his own 
director since he can change the 
performance whenever he feels it 
needs changing.
The play was performed in a 
very relaxed atmosphere with no 
props other than a podium and a 
coffee table and no special ef­
fects. Kuhn himself did not don a 
costume but performed in jeans, 
tennis shoes, and a button-down 
shirt. There was nothing to dis­
tract the audience from what 
Kuhn was saying. He opened the 
Friday night performance with a 
bit of background about himself 
and the play and then continued 
straight into Luke’s gospel with 
barely a pause for a period. From 
then on, the audience was capti­
vated by Kuhn’s eye-witness ac­
counts of events that helped shape 
Western civilization.
Although the material for Ac­
counts is very powerful, it was 
not delivered in a Bible-beating
televangelist style. Instead, it was 
delivered in a rather relaxed 
manner as Kuhn strolled about 
the makeshift theater with an 
occasional Puritanical John the 
Baptist shouting from the pulpit/ 
podium.
The relaxed manner in which 
Kuhn delivered his lines was es­
pecially evident when he de­
clared, “And it came to pass in 
those days that there was a 10 
minute intermission,” without 
interrupting Luke’s Gospel. In 
addition to a radical John the 
Baptist, Kuhn also altered his 
voice and motions for other char­
acters. For example, Kuhn used 
the voice of what he called “an 
Elvis fan club member” for a 
woman in the crowds listening to 
Jesus preach and took on a suave 
persona for Lucifer as he tempted 
Jesus. This certainly was not the 
type of Gospel you are likely to 
hear on Sundays, and that was 
exactly what Kuhn had in mind.
Although he was converted to 
Christianity in his freshman year 
at West Virginia University, 
Kuhn’s performance was not 
meant to attract followers to the 
Christian faith. Actually, the first 
person to perform such a show,
Alec McCowen, who memorized 
the Gospel of St. Mark, was not 
even a Christian.
The show has never been reli­
gious theater. Kuhn stated a main 
reason for The Accounts of Luke 
originating were its cheap pro­
duction costs. However Kuhn 
approached the Actors Theater of 
Louisville as asked, “Wouldn’t it 
be great if whoever performed 
this thought these things actu­
ally happened?” Since then, Ac­
counts has been to England, Scot­
land, and across the United 
States.
After being revived about a year 
and a half ago, Kuhn has been 
taking The Accounts of Luke to 
college campuses across the U.S. 
In addition to the performances, 
Kuhn also holds seminars with 
drama students as well as dem­
onstrating stage combat, which 
he taught at the University of 
Washington where he received 
his Master of Fine Arts degree.

South African apartheid explored in City Theatre’s Playland
Playland 
'k'k'klr'k
Aplay by Athol Fugard. Stars David Butler, John Henry 
Redwood, and Don Wadsworth. Directed by Mladen 
Kiselov. Two South African men, one white and one 
black, meet each other on the outskirts of the amuse­
ment park Playland on the eve of 1990 and learn how: 
to understand one another. Now playing at the City 
Theatre on the South Side through October 17.
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Staffwriter
& JEREMY KRIEGEL
Special to The Tartan
From the opening speech, A Sermon on the Mount 
hollered in a rich African voice from a set builtrtp 
resemble the African veldt, to the end of the play, 
Playland by Athol Fugard, now playing at City 
Theatre, is an intense, meaningful work full of 
detailed and insightful examinations of South Af­
rican apartheid.
The play concerns the meeting of two characters,: 
Martinas Zoeloe (John Henry Redwood) and Gideon 
Le Roux (David Butler) on the eve of1990. Gideon 
encounters Martinas on the desolate outskirts of 
the amusement park Playland, a place to forget the 
problems of everyday life. As the new year ap­
proaches, the secret which each man hides is-; 
brought to light, and a new bond is established 
between the two, bridging all cultural barriers.
Fugard is one of the most acclaimed writers of 
the last few decades. A white author faced with 
portraying the struggles for freedom in South Af­
rica, Fugard has deep insight on troubles facing 
the war-torn country.
Through the use of small casts, usually two or
three actors, and vivid imagery, Fugard is able to 
make the problems in South Africa come to life. 
Playland, as well as Fugard’s other works, includ­
ing “Mastferiiaro/cr. .. And the Boys andBloodkhot, 
deal with the conflicts between white and black 
societies.
His representations are almost too accurate. The 
white man is usually educated, yet can never see 
what is troubling his; soul. The black man, al­
though lacking in formal education, has the wis­
dom and understanding to bring the conflict to a 
successful close. Fugard was raised in South Africa 
and has the firsthand experience necessary to give 
his plays the authenticity which makes them so 
moving.
Redwood has performed in the films Passioti 
Fish and Big, and Has most recently starred in the 
City Theatre-sponsored one-man show Paul 
Robespn at The Martin Luther King, Jr. Cultural 
Center of Pittsburgh, as well as appearing in.m any 
different performances of Fences, his favorite play. 
For Redwood, the greatest challenge was “trying tq 
get a handle oh the culture.” For most African 
Americans, their knowledge of South African cul­
ture is second hand. In preparing for this role, 
Redwood spoke to South African students at 
Carnegie Mellon in order to gain some first-hand 
knowledge of African culture. Redwood is also in 
the midst of writing a new play to be performed for 
youths at the City Theatre’s Theatre for; Young 
Audiences Program. He feels that there is a void in 
theatre, addressing African-American youths on 
subjects like AIDS and drugs.
Butler, a devout Elvis fan, has performed One 
Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Sam Shepherd’s Trite 
West, and in TV shows such as America’s Most 
Wanted^As the World Turns, and Loving., tie also 
appeared in Silence of the Lambs and Dar row. The 
hardest part of this show for Butler was “telling the
story. It really is a tightrope every night.” Because through Friday at 8 pm, Saturdays at 6 and 9 pm,
of the intensity of the play, Butler faced the prob­
lem of making his powerful emotions on-stage 
“mean something.”
At points, Butler said he was forced to such 
intensity that he completely forgot the audience 
existed. His most recent film is Leon, due out next 
spring.
The play was directed by Mladen Kiselov, who 
teaches acting and directing at Carnegie Mellon. 
Also in the cast is Don Wadsworth, CMU associate 
professor of speech and dialects, who plays Barney 
the Barker, an amplified voice that calls the action 
in Playland. Scenery Director Tim Satemow cre­
ates a set 
that truly 
brings the 
audience into 
South Africa 
with original 
music as well 
as popular 
dance music, 
i n c ifii ding 
hits from the 
1950s.
Playland 
at the City 
Theatre on 
the South 
Side, 57 
South 13th

be playing 
until Sun­
day, October 
17,
Shows are

15 minutes before performances for students show­
ing proper ID.

The Accounts of Luke combines theater with religion
Sankai Juku brings beautiful dance to Benedum Center
By KEEGAN FOLK
Tartan Acting Forum Editor
“Studio of mountain and sea” is one 
translation of the name Sankai Juku. I 
feel it is a particularly apt translation 
because this company of Japanese danc­
ers moves with organic motion. “Organic” 
in the sense that their movements are 
flowing and natural — not at all like the 
rigidly choreographed pieces often per­
formed in Western styles of dance. In 
fact, the performance by Sankai Juku at 
the Benedum Center Saturday night was 
unlike any style of dance I have ever 
seen.
Sankai Juku performs in the Butoh 
style, which is a non-traditional style of 
Japanese dance that was developed in 
the 1960s as a way of expressing the 
post-war generation’s feelings about the 
changing world around them. The 
company's artistic director is Ushio 
Aniagatsu, one of the initial creators of 
Butoh. He has been producing works for 
and performing with Sankai Juku since 
1978.
Saturday night’s performance of
Shijima, subtitled “The Darkness Calms 
Down in Space,” was one act consisting of 
seven scenes. Each scene began with very 
quiet music and very slow, subtle move­
ments. The dancers’ bodies created beau­
tiful compositions at the beginning of each 
scene. Costumed in flowing ivory-colored 
skirts and ivory body paint, the dancers 
almost faded into the scenery which was 
nearly the same sandy color. The dance 
began slowly, the dancers barely moving. 
As the music grew, so did the movements 
of the dancers, but they were always very 
minimal. The dancers did not cavort 
around the stage; their movements were 
not what I would describe as energetic. 
Rather, they were reserved, they flowed; 
sometimes like water and sometimes like 
honey.
Sankai Juku’s style of dance is not com­
pletely unlike a lot of modern dance being 
performed today in the West. The differ­
ence, as I see it, is their approach to 
choreography. The center of attention is 
not always the dancer’s body. It may be 
the shadows a dancer creates on the wall 
behind him, or it may be the patterns the 
dancers create with their costumes as
they move.
I would say their performance is almost 
a play as much as it is a dance. Though I 
would be hard pressed to describe the nar­
rative content of the performance, I am left 
with the feeling that I was being shown a 
story. Not a story with a beginning, a 
middle, and an end, but a story that re­
flects some human experience: the story of 
birth, of death, of the way people relate to 
one another. Because the style of Sankai 
Juku is fairly minimalist, it is possible to 
see how one might become bored during a 
performance. Fortunately, the performance 
was only about an hour and a half long. The 
music, the costumes, and the set were all 
beautiful.
The worst part about the whole perfor­
mance was that it was in the Benedum. 
The Benedum is just too big a venue for 
Sankai Juku. The theater was full, but it 
would be nice to have had the performance 
on two nights in a smaller theater. Because 
the music was very quiet throughout much 
of the performance, the audience was 
treated to a constant chorus of coughing, 
hacking, chatter, and the generally annoy­
ing noise that comes from large crowds.
Regardless, I am very glad to have had the 
chance to see Sankai Juku. They will tour 
North America again in 1995. If you have 
never seen them, take that opportunity to 
see their very striking style of performing.
Lugh..„~„ opens at Public
By TARA ZANE
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
The 1992 Tony Award win­
ning Best Broadway Play, 
Dancing At Lughnasa, opens 
this Friday, October 8, at the 
Pittsburgh Public Theater in : 
Allegheny Square on theNorth 
Side. Irish playwright Brian ' 
Friel wrote this and other in-' 
temationally acclaimed plays 
including Philadelphia, Here 
I Come!, Aristocrats, and 
Translations. His most recent 
play, Wonderful Tennesseej 
will make its Broadway debut 
this Thursday, October 7. ’
The plot of Dancing At ‘ 
Lughnasa is loosely based on 
Friel’s life. The play is set in 
the summer, of 1936 in a vil-. 
lage in County Donegal, Ire­
land where the LughnasaFes- 
tival takes place honoring the 
pagan harvest god Lugh. A 
man named Michael narrates; 
the play, sharing his impres-: 
sions of what the festival wasi 
like for him when he was seven 
years old living with his un­
married mother and four 
aunts. Michael is reunited 
with his Uncle Jack who re­
turns to County Donegal after 
deserting his duties as a mis-; 
sionaiypriestin Uganda.That 
summer he also meets his va­
grant father for the first time.: 
The magnificence of the radio 
is celebrated as well with song; 
and dance livening the stage.
Al though these incidents may, 
seem pedestrian and plain,; 
Friel masterfully writes this; 
play as a wonderful drama fo­
cused on the passion and forti-; 
tude of human relationships. : 
Director Jacques Cartier; 
adds Dancing At Lughnasa to 
his extensive list of impres-: 
sive productions. Othello,', 
Death of a Salesman, A Street-',

Day’s Journey Into Night are! 
just a few of the big name!

New Dark Horse comic extends Indiana Jones’ story
We temporarily interrupt this column 
for some reader response. Yes, I have 
mail and I’m going to share a bit of Scott 
Morgan’s letter with you. Here is his 
opinion on my Superpatriot column from 
two weeks ago. “I would like to say that 
I have begun to become quite disap­
pointed with Erik Larsen. He is begin­
ning, if you forgive the expression, to 
pull a Rob Liefield; that is, to work on too 
many things at once, and his original 
book, Savage Dragon, is beginning to 
suffer for it.” Also, Morgan addressed 
the gimmick cover issue. “Even if we are 
generous and say that the kid is getting 
$10 a week and he or she decides to 
; spend it all on comics, how many books 
can he/she afford if they begin to cost $2- 
3 apiece? The average comic price today
COMIC BOOK CHRONICLES
by Jason Andracki
is around $1.75 apiece. Am I the only 
collector who can remember when you 
could buy them for under a dollar? I have 
had to begin to cut back on what I can 
collect because the price has gotten to be 
too much, and I work a regular job!” 
Thanks again for the letter, and I hope 
my other readers enjoyed reading your 
comments.
Now on to regular business. A few
weeks ago, Dark Horse Comics released 
the first issue of a new six issue limited 
series, Indiana Jones: Thunder in the 
Orient. I’ve read Dark Horse’s previous 
Indiana Jones series and have seen all 
three movies, so I’m quite an Indiana 
Jones fan.
Although they don’t compare to the 
movies, both comics are the best stuff 
from Dark Horse I’ve ever read. First of 
all, the first issue of Thunder in the 
Orient has a great cover painting by 
Dave Dorman, the only comic artist that 
can make a cover painting look like a 
photograph. He is definitely in the ranks 
of Marvel Masterpiece’s Joe Jusko. The 
interior art by Dan Barry (who is also 
the writer) is great, but pales in com­
parison to the cover. Barry has also done 
a commend­
able job on the 
story. He ma­
nages to in­
clude many 
familiar parts 
of the movies 
in his book. 
There is the 
sidekick, 
Khamal, a 
young boy 
from Tripoli, 
and the love 
interest Dr. 
Sophie 
Hapgood, a 
psychic scien­
tist who first 
appeared in 
The Fate of 
Atlantis.

has made a suc­
cessful original 
comic book series 
based on a movie.
Their past suc­
cesses include 
Star Wars: Dark 
Empire, and 
Aliens vs. Preda­
tor. This surely 
belongs among 
those critically 
acclaimed books.
Also, if you like

you’re afraid this

Like Water For Chocolate
Like Water for Chocolate is the romance movie 
to end all romance movies. A man is in love with a 
woman whose mother will not let her get married 
until her older sister is married. In order to remain 
closer to the woman he is in love with, he marries 
her sister. The movie is filled with mystic images, 
fantasy, and melodrama which are blended so well 
together, that one is never sure where the line of 
reality and fantasy gets crossed. Like Water for 
Chocolate was filmed in Mexico and has many 
cultural references that are harder to understand 
if you’re not from that culture. However, this 
melodramatic film is beautifully written and shot 
and should be a joy to all who see it.
The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Monty Python and the 
Holy Grail
This movie is a classic cult favorite. Starring 
Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, 
Eric Idle, and the rest of the Flying Circus, the 
movie tells the “story” of King Arthur gathering 
his round table in a quest to find the sacred holy 
grail. The quest involves many different situa­
tions, each as hilarious as the next. You’ll follow 
the tales of Sir Robin and his minstrel, Sir Galahad 
and his peril, Sir Lancelot and the prince, the 
Rnights who say “Ni!,” and of course, King Arthur 
and his interactions with the black knight, the 
monster rabbit, and the Gorge of Eternal Peril. If 
you love Monty Python, British comedy, or simply 
a good laugh, you must come and see this trea­
sured movie. Come early; Monty followers will 
raid Doherty Hall. Those that refuse to see this 
movie will be sacked.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Dune
Dune does not do justice to Frank Herbert’s 
highly acclaimed science fiction novel from which 
the movie is based. Although writer and director 
David Lynch includes bits of blood, sex, and vio­
lence, the flick is onerous, melancholic, and ex­
tremely long. The opening scene involves an un­
usual narration which attempts to set up the plot 
of the movie which takes place in the year 10,991.
One of Dune’s few redeeming qualities, how­
ever, is its cast. Dean Stockwell, singer Sting, No 
Way Out’s Sean Young, and Twin Peaks’ Kyle 
MacLachlan are just a few of the big names star­
ring in the film. Lesser-known actors like Linda 
Hunt, Freddie Jones, Virginia Madsen, and Rich­
ard Jordan also have fine performances in Dune.
At 6, 9 pm, and midnight.
Sunday, October 10
Dr. Phibes Rises Again
This horror movie, sequel to The Abominable 
Dr. Phibes, is just as amusing and suspenseful as 
its predeccesor. Vincent Price resumes his role as 
the desperate, lonely doctor who attempts to avenge 
the death of his wife who died in a car crash. After 
the accident, he is unable to live without her and 
schemes to resurrect her in any way possible. The 
unstability of his mind contributes to the twisted 
plot and makes for a terror filled flick.
Although the storyline may sound simplistic 
and corny, both the first movie and this sequel got 
good reviews by Martin and Porter’s Video Movie 
Guide 1990.

"When the real is no longer what it use to be, nostalgia assumes its full meaning. There is a proliferation of myths of origin and signs of reality; of second hand truth, objectivity, and authenticity. There is an escalation of the true, of the lived experience; a resurrection of the figurative where the object and the substance have disappeared. And there is a panic-stricken production of the real and the referential, above and parallel to the panic of material production: this is 
i how simulation appears in the phase that concerns us—a strategy of the real, 
i neo-real, and hyperreal, whose universal double is a strategy of deterrence."—Jean Baudrillard
Paper TigerThe problem with the past revolutions has been that they were fought against the wrong enemy. While it is clear that capitalism and our current government system go hand in hand, it is the media which fuels our country's rampant ignorance.It constantly peddles to the lowest common denominator and makes us prisoners of the latest headline or fad. Do not let them control you any longer. Each and every person has the power to build his and her own media: to write a story, to create an e-mail magazine, or even to photocopy his or her favorite images and make a small newspaper. When you see a picture you like, or read a great published work, copy it and transmit it to others. Copyright is a lie.
This Dossier is just for you. Take it home. Fix a mug of the best hot drink in the world — your Favorite. Settle down in the coziest chair with plenty of cushions and comforters. Read the words we've printed on these pages. Take them to heart. Be at peace. Relax, enjoy.

when I started getting off, 
but we made it. I didn't know 
about swerving. Just kept driving.
The water was thick and warm 
and quickly surrounded me.
I swam all the way out to the middle, 
loving how it felt to be weightless — 
as if it was impossible to sink.
And dien I remembered 
the mine shafts buried under 
the lake — how one 
wall could collapse and stick 
the whole lake into the ground, 
the water too big to fight, 
almost wishing it . . .

At the trial he is acquitted based on the supposition that he is elastic and that this is why his wife has died. He cannot help but wonder what life would have been Dke if 
he’d only had that one additional carbon atom. He cannot help but think that then he would have been able to stretch out and catch the pan instead of propelling it His 
shame is immeasurable and he breaks down in tears, crying: “Dear God! I never meant any harm, but how can I help what I can’t hope to change?”
His family refuses to deal with him anymore. They are tired of his 
excuses. He is 35 mid standing on the 46th story ledge of the First 
National Insurance building. He wants to jump, but for some reason 
he simply can’t get himself to do it. He is being pulled back into the 
building by police officers when his foot catches on the windowsill 
and he launches across the boulevard, pinballing back and forth 
between the First National Insurance and the large office complex 
directly across from it. Immediately he Is rushed to the hospital, but 
this time it is too Iate.tt is decided that a viewing would be inappro­
priate. The funeral is a solemn occasion. It is a time of deep regret.
Everyone now feels sorry has having taken advantage of his weak- .,

As I sit with my feast of stolen bread 
h And water, in a place not mine yet home,
by Matt Ball And watch as through the window
The hill slowly consumes my brief light
2 Jg. Bringing to end another cap of week,
The air still about me with the roar 
' Of the city a muted hum drown
By the clock ticking steadily forward,
I try to look back at the faint flashes 
Buckling through the secluded haze.
."'j? 0 1 &
¦¦ SJ?
Yesterday I walked for hours in the 
Icy wind, trying to accomplish a thing — 
Any or some. Sitting on the fallen trunk 
Of a once-successful life, above clear field 
Billowing, below the cut sky hurling
Frozen chips of rivers and ponds thru me, 
Facing god in futile defiance as I awaited 
Punishment for the denial that had become 
My life, yet left untouched by the breath 
Of fury, or even the void of warmth death.
Today it seemed no longer odd in the time 
Unconnected. Only numb, with something 
Asking to be given a chance; just enough 
To drive from mere life to hell and look 
At the faces still caged. From before I arrived
Till after I would be far away and traipsing 
About in bliss, they would remain howling 
Unheard in the convenient boxes — the cute 
Ones shuffled about the front, trouble kept in 
The back, pity and time from a constant few.
No questions came my way, no concern nor 
Guilt as I stood in the office and conversation 
Continued on. No guilt, either, from the dogs 
As their lives stopped and focused through 
The bars at the bundled, uptight, weak figure
With the power to set them free. Who cares 
About looks or money or love? Let me out! 
No attempts at persuasion or coercion, just 
Screams upon screams, cried to all others, 
Freedom to the bidder most forceful.
PL''L

---------------------------------------------------

But shame and pain did come as before 
Until I saw the girl, young lady of thirteen. 
Small even with the dogs, bigger than I. 
Her face intent determination, shuffling 
Fragments of furry energy to brief glory.
She had ridden her bike again, from where 
I do not know, through the persuasive frost 
Keeping the liberal concerns home warm with 
Their checkbooks. Right to work she was when 
I arrived, her bike still there when I fell away.
I did not even stop to think How can I save 
Myself? for I felt too small, unworthy. Rather,
I wondered of myself as a father, creator, hoping 
To bring forth someday something larger than 
My intentions. Another lie thrown to the future.
No amnesty because this was not me caged, 
Nor torment riding my ruin. Neither did 
I feelloved, nor connected, standing numb 
In the yard, the wind screaming as the sun 
Peeked from behind the floating black cotton
And the dog sniffing at a patch of dead grass 
I'm sure he had seen before. Yet there was 
Something, although I could not say what.
But I knew the life was straining at the end of the 
Leash was the trigger. Let me go! Let me go.
I sit here now shadowed and wish I could 
Know that I wish I could explain. I wish 
As well I had someone to call and read to them 
My thoughts and fears. Or a daughter to watch 
Play, unburdened and content, with her dog.
