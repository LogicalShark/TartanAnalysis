CARNIVAL PERFORMANCE AT DAVIS

WALLACE, DIRECTOR
Tickets on Sale May 5 For 
Public and Student 
Nights
“The- Show-Off,” George Kelley’s 
amusing comedy, which is to be the 
Spring Carnival show will be pre­
sented by the drama department under 
the direction of Mr. Chester M. 
Wallace at the Davis Theater on 
Friday and Saturday evenings, May 
9 and 10.“The Show-Off” is well known to 
everyone who is familiar with the 
theater. It had a record run- of over, 
seventy weeks on Broadway and has 
been called by Iicywood Broun "the 
finest comedy ever written by an 
American.” The author, George Kel­
ley, is also the author of the Pulitzer 
Prize play “Craig’s Wife.”
For several years it has been the 
desire of Mr. Wallace to produce a 
Kelley play. The Carnival has of­
fered a splendid opportunity for him 
to do so since the superlatively en­
tertaining quality òf this particular 
comedy makes it especially appropri­
ate for presentation at such a time. 
It is principally a drama of character, 
the plot centering about a young 
man who atlcmpts to make a mil­
lion dollar impression on a thirty dol­
lar job.The members of the cast arc as 
follows : Aubrey Piper, William
Johns; Mrs. Fisher, Arraminta Gul­
ley; Clara, Bertha Rubin; Frank Hy­
land, Don Bonhoff ; Mr. Fisher, Bertt 
TVicK'eej Joe, McClellan1- Shinn ;' Mr. 
Gill, Dale Phalen.
The first night the play will be 
open principally to the public' and the 
second evening is being featured as 
student night. Tickets will be on sale 
at a booth at the end of the Cut 
starting Monday, ' 'sy 5. A down­
town sale will be held at a place to 
ba announced later. The price range 
is $1.50 for orchestra seats, $1.00 for 
the first ablcony, and second balcony 
$.75.
Each fraternity, as well as the 
Student Council, will have its own 
section. Candy will be sold by Mar-

Number Enrolled 
In Physics Major 
Increased By 100%
The Department of Physics will 
be increased by over 100 per cent 
by next year’s Sophomore Class. 
There were 57 applicants for the 
¦ course, of which 20 Avere accepted. 
At present the. number of students 
in the Avhole department is about 
20.
In discussing the ¡subject,- Prof. 
Hower, head of the department, 
said:
"The Physics Department will 
be glad ‘ to have more men to 
recommend for positions offered 
Avith A'arious companies and in 
various laboratories. The research 
laboratories throughout the coun­
try have been adding physicists* 
sometimes by the dozen, sometimes 
only as many as they could get. 
The industries have discoArered that 
they have many positions, that can 
be Avell filled by physicists.
“Since June last there have been 
applications for graduates of the 
Physics course from many sources. 
The Taylor Instrument Company 
got one man and Avrote for five 
more to Avork on navigation instru- 
anents for airplanes. The VOL. 
Chemical ‘Company Avantcd a man 
to do research on. the effect of 
radiations on chemical reactions, 
but no one Avas available. Our 
graduates have found positions 
Avith the Curtiss Lighting Com- 
pan}-, Macbeth-Evans Glass Com­
pany, Gulf Research Laboratory 
on precision instruments, General 
Motors and West Penn XOL.I, 
Company, etc.
"To further give an idea of the 
diversity of the field of physics, 
Ave might tell about a feAV of the 
graduates. William Bell is intro­
ducing vitaphoncs into. England. 
William Carson is making radio 
tubes in Pennsylvania. Hyman 
Diamond is doing research Avork 
for Westinghouse on television. 
Eugene Crebs is in the Research 
Department of the Bell Labora­

a Scotchman in .» kiltie on a back­
ground of deep purple, the thistle 
color. The other fine art work and

tion to the Industrial Use -of Air” 
Avill be William H. Carrier’s sub­
ject. Avhen lie speaks in- Carnegte 
Union, April 30 at 8:30 p. m.
Air conditioning started as an 
industry in 1902. In that year a 
man in New York engaged in the 
color process business, asked the 
Buffalo • Forge Company Avhy he 
Avas having so much trouble Avith 
his colors. The Buffalo company 
assigned Mr. Carrier to solve the 
problem. He found that air hu­
midity Avas the an.SAver. Working 
both on the drafting board and in 
the machinc shop, lie was able to 
manufacture Avcather. As soon as 
he secured sufficient capital, he 
formed the Carrier Engineering. 
Corporation Avhich has grown until 
now it is valued at something over 
100 million dollars.
Manufactured Avcather benefits 
many industries. Without manu­
factured Aveathcr there Avould be 
no rayon. Tobacco Avould be soggy 
and poorly cured. The movrc in­
dustry Avould be troubled by at­
mospheric conditions. The poAvder, 
flour baking, and candy industries 
would be greatly hampered and 
restricted.
Mr. Carrier, who brought about 
this industry, Avas born November 
25, 1876, at Angola, N. Y. He had 
to struggle to get an education, 
and taught school while preparing 
for collcgc. Having secured a

M’GEORGE TO PLAY 
AT NEXT TEA DANCE
Another tea dancc, just as de­
lightful and entertaining as the 
past tea danccs have been, Avill be 
given by the Athletic Association 
in the Carnegie Union this Thurs­
day, May 1. Jerry McGcorgc and 
his “Carncgians” Avill provide the 
music, playing only ncAV and popu­
lar jazz. Tickcts for this dancc 
at 50 cents for/ men and 25 cents 
for Avomcn, arc being sold on the 
campus by representatives of cach 
school. Bccause of the succcss of 
all past tea danccs, judging from 
the numbers Avho have attended 
and . the pleasure derived by all, 
this tea dance, the last before 
Campus Week, promises to be 
equally successful. Jerry McGcorgc, 
a member of the Beta Theta Pi 
fraternity, and his “Carncgians,1 
seem to have met with the hearty 
approval of the student body, for 
he has played at all the past tea 
dances. The hours of the dance 
Av ill be as usual, from 4 till 6 
o'clock on Thursday afternoon.
Parry Committee Adds New 
Books To Hut Collection
Approximately 30 new popular 
books, placed on the shelves for 
the first time on Exhibition Night, 
have been added to the Parry 
Memorial Collection in the Huf by 
the Parry committee, the Margaret 
Morrison Alumni Association. These 
arc all rcccnt noteworthy books 
published in 1929 or 1930, and arc 
now available to the student body. 
The Parry collection, found in th: 
rear of the Hut in the Parry 
room, was established in honor of 
Francbs P. Parry, former head of 
the Department of English.
The following arc the new books: 
“Letters of Katherine Mansfield," 
two volumes; "Collected Poems,” 
by E. A. Robinson; “The Testa­
ment of Beauty,” by Robert Brid­

Pittsburgh Country Club 
to Be the Scene of 
Ye Brawl
The committee in charge of the 
annual Senior ball has completed 
its, arrangements for the last formal 
event of the school year. As has 
been previously announced it Avill 
be held at the Pittsburgh Country 
Club, Becclnvood boulevard, on 
May 2, from 10 o’clock till 2. Art 
Giles and his popular E\'erglade 
Orchestra will furnish the music; 
lie is Avell known, having played 
for many collcgc danccs. The ad­
mission is $5 a couplc.
A supper Avill be served by the 
club about midnight; it Avill easily 
be the most elaborate served this 
year at any dance. The ballroom 
will not be dccoratcd, as it has 
been recently refurnished Avith ncAv 
bangings and drapes. The pro­
grams, too, arc a novel departure 
from the usual run; they are a 
neutral shade of green of a fabric 
which is newly used in this capac­
ity. During the intermission an 
attractive specialty number will be 
presented.
The committee in charge of the 
affair is headed by George Beclccr, 
Who Avill lake care of the pro­
grams and tickcts; Dorothy Bowser 
is in charge of the ball and the 
supper; 1-Icnry Bunker, orchestra; 
Harriet Hnnna, chapcrons, and Ken 
Owcnp, publicity.
The Senior ball is always a bril­
liant affair, as it is not confined 
to seniors alone but includes under­
classmen' also. The conventional 
.men’s attire for the occasion is 
either a tux or white flannels aiid 
dark coat. The Dragons arc hold­
ing their annual spring banquet at 
the club previous to the dance. 
Gcovge Becker is also in charge 
of the arratigci'ncnts for the din­
ner, Avhich is scheduled for 7:30 
o’clock.
The tickcts have been placed in 
the various fraternity houses to 
facilitate disposal.

worth while to adJ soccer to its 
ever-growing list of regular sports.
Carnegie women, do you want 
soccer as a regular sport?
ArcheryBeginners of-this sport should con- 
scicntously report to all the practices 
this week and the beginning of next 
week, At these first practices, Elsa 
Weber, archery manager, will give 
official instructions which will be in­
valuable to beginners, Notices will 
be posted on the main ’bulletin board 
when practices will be held. Archery 
promises to be one of the most 
enjoyable of spring sports.
BaseballBaseball practices continue every 
noon from 12:30 to 1:30 either in 
the Women’s gym or the Carnegie 
Bowl. Lois McGregor, baseball man­
ager, posts every day official notices 
as to which place the practices will 
be held. Already much enthusiasm 
and interest is being shown in this 
sport. It is very probably that there 
will be four well matched class 
teams by the end of the seaso)).
Volley Ball
Volley ball, under . the manage­
ment of Gracc Jarvis, closed a very 
successful season last week. The 
number of women, out for their 
class teams during the recent sea­
son exactly doubled the number of 
the 1929 season, cprcscnting every 
class and including a very fair rep­
resentation of the Arts Collcgc, 
the candidates numbered* 82 wom­
en. Not only was there a greater 
number of players, but of this 
number, 75 per ’ cent practiced 
faithfully and arc eligible for team 
points—a very good average! This 
is not only indicative of a greater 
interest in volley ball, but swhat is 
more important, ie significant of 
the general increase of interest be­
ing shown in all the sports in oth­
er fields.
The results of the past tourna­
ment gives preference to the soph­
omore team led by Elsie Guggcn- 
| heim and the Arts team led by 
Ruth Amcrling. These two teams 
will play the championship game today at noon.
Will the captains of the class 
teams, Marian McNary, fresliman, 
Elsie Guggenheim, sophomore,

of Mr. and Mrs. G. M. Whisler. 
The guests of honor were Mr. and 
Mrs. Ross' Hertz who are playing 
in "June Moon” at the Geary Thea­

H. A. Neutzenholzcr was elected 
president. Mrs. Neutzenholzer will 
serve as secretary and treasurer. 
Their address is 553 Crafton street, Oakland, Cal.

again on April 12 for a luncheon 
meeting at the home of Helen Lee 
Futch. The activities for the 
month of April were brought to a 
close with a bridge on April 25 at 
Lip Brothers.
From all indications every suc­

A SECTION OF THE TARTAN 
DEVOTED TO 
THE NIGHT STUDENTS^Ibe Carnegie flMaiò
INTER-NIGHT COLLEGE 
DANCE, MAY 10th, 
MEN’S GYMNASIUM
Carnegie without an Exhibition 
would be like a house without a 
roof, or a building without a door. 
On Friday evening last, the yearly 
exhibition was held, and from all 
indications it was more successful 
than any previously held. This is 
as it should be, since new things 
are added and new inventions arc 
made. It would be difficult to say 
any one section had a monopoly 
because crowds were everywhere. 
Even the cafeteria was taxed to 
supply the demand of those de­
manding. Those who attended cer­
tainly received a treat long to be 
remembered. When the gong 
sounded 10":30 p. m. I am sure 
there were a great number of peo­
ple who possessed tired pediments 
and longed for wheel chairs, like 
they have in Atlantic City, to roll 
them home.I see that the date of the next 
function, the Inter Night College 
dance, has been changed from Fri­
day, May 9, to Saturday, May 10. 
How come, and why? At al] events, 
I am sure there is a reason, and I 
am going to be on hand for this 
windup to the general social ac­
tivities of the Night Campus. All 
the other parties have been howl­
ing successes and I am not going 
to miss this one.
Now for a little hard luck—for 
is this not the time Exams, are 
prevalent. And who invented these 
pesky things anyway. It can’t be 
the students I am sure They 
know everything, so why bother 
them to find out how little they 
know. Someday, sometime, some­
body will come along abolishing 
this pastime of the faculty, and 
then they will have to devise some 
other cruelties.
I wonder how man students have 
donated their locker key refund to 
the Endowment. Everybody should 
be willing to help, this cause along, 
because if we didn’t have generous 
givers, our tuition would have to 
mount up to a considerably larger 
figure than what it is now. Come 
along fellows, give it freely. It is 
— fdr a good cause, and anyhow, you 
have spent the money, or at least 
it is as good as spent. Let’s see 
if we can’t make this a home run.
Somebody in Engineering has a 
girl friend, I know, else why advo­
cate more telephone booths in this 
august college. Cheer up; M. A. C., 
some day we will have some sys­
tem via radio, where you will not' 
require any telephone booths; all 
you will have to do is broadcast. In 
the meantime be patient and per­
haps a way out of the predicament 
will be found for you and the girl 
friend.
Well, h<jrc we are at the end of 
school, and no traffic light install­
ed. I was right when I said that 
they ra'n out of funds for this ne­
cessity at the Cut, or else why 
has not the blinker been removed 
and a real traffic light been in­
stalled? Perhaps if we wait long 
enough it will be installed in time 
for our children to use. Who 
knows?
Recently I have heard melodious 
strains emanating from the College 
of Fine Arts, and I put this down 
as an indication of spring, because 
the windows are open to let out 
the hot notes. It would be a ter­
rible infliction upon those Art stu­
dents to make them play in the 
studios with the windows shut to keep 
out the air or keep in the sound; 
which, I will leave'to your own judg­
ment.
A Few Fasts
About Niagara Falls
I had occasion during the past 
winter to go to Buffalo, N. Y., and 
while there I took a trip over to 
get a look at Niagara Falls in win­
ter dress. If you have seen the 
, falls in the summer time, and most 
eVery American has, especially the 
married ones, it is really worth 
while to make the winter trip, for 
there is such a complete change of scenery.
The rocks in the gorge below the 
falls were covered with ice as well 
as most everything else that the 
spray from the Falls came in con­
tact with. It is indeed a most 
wonderful sight at night, when the 
-cOlbred lights are turned on and 
the beams of light falling on the 
Ice are reflected in many different colors.
Being an engineer in heart if not 
in fact, and thinking that some of 
my fellow students may be inter­
ested, I am giving a bit of infor­
mation that I obtained concerning 
the Falls during my visit.
The American Falls are 167 feet 
high, while the Horseshoe or Cana­
dian Falls are 162 feet from base 
to crest. The length of the crest 
is, American Falls, 1,000 feet; 
Horseshoe Falls, 3,000 feet, and 
G6at Island Cliff, 1,300 feet, or a 
i6tal length of over a mile. The 
ndnnaJ flow of the river is 93,150,- 
000 gallons per minute, of which 
only o per cent goes over the 
American Falls, and the remaining 
94 per cent goes over the .Canadian

INTER-NIGHT
COLLEGE DANCE
The Night Student Council can­
celled its reservation of the Gym­
nasium on May 9 • for the Inter 
Night College Dance in favor of 
the Day Council so that there would 
be no interference in .the Spring 
Festival which the latter organiza­
tion is holding next week.
This date was reserved last year, 
long: before any thought or plans for 
the day function had been made, and 
it certainly shows a splttndid spirit of 
co-operation on the part o£ the 
Night Student Council.
A substitute date, May 10, has 
been made, and plans arc made to 
have .this affair a big success. There­
fore make a note of this change in 
your handbook, May 10, Inter Night 
College Dance, Gymnasium.

Soak Stemm ligtiftlE
Time. , and .again I’ve, been asked 
this and that question, and have had 
no’ room to print the answer. Now, 
good excuse, a week of bad books, 
unpreparedness day, and voila! lots 
of time and space to answer ques­
tions. Here goes:
A.G.—The magazine you are think­
ing of is “The American Mercury."
,-F.D.M.—S. S. Van Dine is the pen 
name of William Huntington Wright. 
He has ¡written another mystery novel 
“The Scarab Murder Case” now run­
ning serially in one of the popular 
magazines.
J.H.C.—If yoii read Vulgar Winchell 
you would have noticed that Lucius 
Apuleis’ “The Golden Ass” can be 
had in the “Modem Library.” Walk 
down to Jones’ and ask for it.
G.M.—Greta (ab-ah) Garbo's pic­
ture “Anna Christie" was taken from 
the stage play of the same name, by. 
Eugene O’Neil—as if j'ou didn’t know! 
Waiting now for anything else?
E.S.—There are two Bob Davises. 
Richard Harding Davis was the 
writer.
E.H.W.—rNo, I don’t know anything 
about anyone writing a book about 
Plastic Recession, and I don’t know 
anyone who knows anything about it. 
So there!
K.I.—-,As far as I know, Booth 
Tarkington is still having quite a bad 
time of it.with his eyes..
F.R.—Punch the fool in the nose. 
“Green Hat” was the best book 
Michael Arlen ever wrote,
J.G.—For your nervousness, I’d ad­
vise “Boy Scout Jamboree,” and if 
you aren't much worse in one week, 
see a Charles (Buddy) Rogers’ pic­
ture, If THAT doesn’t do you some­
thing—God help you!

Facts About Paintings, 
“King Csphetus And 
The Beggar Maid”
Perhaps no painting by Burne- 
Jones shows the exquisite execu­
tion of every fine detail as does 
the picture of the Beggar Maid. 
He had models made expressly for 
the armor and the shield of the 
King, and each bit of adornment 
received as fine a finish as if it 
could not be too beautiful for the 
accomplishment of his ideal. This 
painting was finished in 1884. In 
the Paris exposition of 1889 it 
occupied the place of honor among 
the English pictures. It now belongs 
to England and ln.3 a permanent 
place in the Tate Gallery, London. 
• The old, old story is in the 
form of a ballad which tells how a 
King in Africa, named Cophetua, 
loved a beggar maid, "all in grey,” 
and-took her for his queen. Before 
the maid in her little grey gown,
Falls. The Niagara River drops 
336 feet during its course from 
Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.
Although the Horseshoe Falls are 
the longest and carry the most 
water, I consider the American 
Falls the most beautiful because of 
their conture.

THE LAST ARTS DANCE
This is' quite a'1 late "date;/ to en­
large on the good times had at'the 
last Nitc Arts Dance, but apprecia­
tion is forthcoming. Rally ’round you 
Nite Arts. How many had a good 
time April 5? Hold your ears every- 
bodjr. Believe you me, the Student 
Council needs, better say, deserves, 
a couple of votes of thanks.
There were refreshments, and how, 
a Grand March with favors—those 
squeals of delight you heard were 
from the girls for the highly original 
favors they received. The noises you 
heard sounding very much like the 
twelve o’clock whistle came from 
lusty throats blowing on those pipes, 
dumbells (no wise-cracks), cigars, etc., 
that were the men’? favors. That 
music came from the best orchestra 
the Nile Arts have had, the Red 
Peppers. That, my little dears, is an 
orchestra, what I mean. And now, 
there’s another Dance coming soon. 
Don’t worry; it’s after Exams—so 
joy can again be undefined (pun). 
You may obtain tickets easily, it’s 
to be at the Gym, there'll be an­
other swell orchestra, another balloon 
scramble—what is more fun? See you 
there. May 10 is the date.

sits the King, clad in brilliant 
black armor. He holds a finely 
modelled crown of dark metal and 
lighted up with the red rubies and 
coral. His face in clear cut profile 
is raised in silent contemplation. 
The scene is sumptious; costly 
stuffs glisten and gleam—and the 
polished metal reflects, the beggar 
maid’s exquisite feet, their ivory 
whiteness enhanced by contrast 
with the scarlet anemones that lie 
around her.
Sir Edward Burne-Jones was 
born in Birmington in 1833 and 
died in London in 1873. His Celtic 
dfescent may account for his im­
agination, his love of the mysteri­
ous, and his thirst for beauty. 
Fame came to him late in life. 
Four years before his death, the 
Queen made him a baronet, one of 
England’s ways of recognizing dis­
tinguished merit.

Didja Notice that while this col­

ment on the shortage of paper towels,

Inter-Night College
Dance May 10
Plans are shaping up for a whirl­
wind climax of the night campus 
activities in the form of the tra­
ditional Inter Night College Dance, 
This dance is the oldest function 
on the campus, cither night or day. 
It has been successfully conducted 
since its premier appearance on the 
campus years and years ago.
The date has been changed from 
May 9 to 10 (one day later), but 
this will not handicap anybody, 
nor will it curtail any of the con­
templated festivities. The date 
was changed in favor of the Day 
Council.
Examinations will be over and 
Studies will be the farthest from 
our thoughts. It is fitting that we 
should have a windup to a lopg 
regime of study. Tickets arc on 
sale everywhere, so be sure to se­
cure yours and attend this func­
tion. Dancing will be in force 
from 8:30 p. m. until midnight. Re­
member to get your “date” and be 
on hand for this party.
Three Night Art 
Students Come Through
The result of the late charctt gives 
credit to three night architects who 
have taken an active part in night 
student activities. The successful stu­
dents are James H. Sansonctti, Presi­
dent of the Night Student Council, 
Wm. E. Hoover, Jr., President 
Night College of Fine Arts, and 
Philip B. Bown, Secretary of Night 
College of Fine Arts. It has often 
been said that activities hinder the 
progress of students, but indications 
arc just as often the reverse, and 
anyway these activities broaden the 
students who take part in them, and 
after all is that not what education 
is intended to do?
The Plaid wishes to congratulate 
these three night students for their 
attainments, for to get a passirtg 
grade in the Beaux Arts problems 
at New York is no mean achievement.

The Dear Daughters Have Their Troubles
The Daughters have always, as far as we know, displayed 
no little interest in the problem of national defense. There is 
that black list of persons of note who shall never darken the 
door of a D. A.. R. hall. There are the endless resolutions of 
chapters from Maine to Claifornia, demanding evidences of 
patriotism, bristling patriotism, from kindergarten teachers on 
up. There is the annual meeting in Washington where more 
sabres are rattled and the. dear old ladies become a bit hyster­
ical in their enthusiasm for bigger war machines and no en­
tangling alliances.
We have long wondered how otherwise intelligent, gentle, 
cultured women’ could associate themselves with such an or­
ganization. There is no need for war societies in this country 
today. We pacifists are not yet a threat to army and navy 
bills. A naval conference, ushered in with world wide enthus­
iasm, has committed this nation to more rather than to less war 
building. Peace has had ^ts brief day of popularity. Under 
such circumstances it is a bit difficult to see any real cause for 
the Daughters’ worried hecklings of anyone, not even the 
President.'Thus the news fo Mrs. Marvin B. Rosenberry’s resignation 
from the D. A. R. is particularly welcome, "I cannot with self- 
respect continue my affilaition with the national D. A. R.,” 
Mrs. Rosenberry stated. “It was quite in keeping with the 
dominant element in the organization that meeting as it did in 
the capital'of the nation, in Holy Week, it, should there adopt 
resolutions which are a slap in the face of President Hoover, 
the greatest advocate of the greatest sane project for world 
peace yet brought forward.”
We hope that this is only a beginning of wholesale resigna­
tions from, th esQciety. We cannot be much disturbed, either, 
over General President Mrs. Lowell Fletcher Hobart’s remark 
that such resignations are “just another attempt to use the 
D. A.- R. for peace propaganda purposes.” Peace and the D. A. 
R,.—horrors!
—Daily Cardinal.
Personality
Personality is a very complex thing, nevertheless, it is the one 
thing to whi$h employers attach most importance—more even than relative class standing, • when each spring they give our senior : classes “the once over.”I have heard the following advice given to those about to be , examined by employers:,, that they should put on their b9St man-- ; nor, polish their shoes, clean finger nails and get a fresh necktie. Mighty good advice that, as far as it goes. How much better, though, if Freshmen were to realize that they too must some day pass this'most critical moment in their lives and prepare ofor it.But personality is something more than polished shoes and a fresh necktie. It has to do with spiritual growth, with habits, companionships, environment, health and character. If we do not watch out, we shall find that at the age of 20 to 30 we have drifted into a personality having serious social and business drawbacks.: Some of the characteristics whicn make for a successful personal­ity are: reliability, loyalty, promptness, preparedness, initiative, 
cheerfulness, frankness, accuracy in both work and conversation, cleanliness and neatness, in both work and person, the knack of knowing where things are and how to use them, tact, entcrtain- • ing and worthwhile conversation, and with all a bit of modesty, some respect for superiors and elders, a lot of charity (if you. know what that means) and no end of respect for the commonly accepted ethical standards.
If you have all these—my stars! the employers will be eating right out of your hand (but-if they, do, don’t forget about that modesty business); And even if you.only have -half.of them you ..will, still be in demand, so. valuable and yet so scarce are these characteristics.But did I hear somebody, say: “Oh' I've heard that kind of stuff before and I’m Sick of it.” Well, the only reason for being so ill over it is, that, not having any of the “stuff” you realize your handicap and are a bit sore about it. Am I right?Now, just put this in your pipe and smoke it. Manufacturersand business men these days keep card records of the characteris- ‘ tics' of their employees, so that when promotion is in order they go to these cards and then and there pick out their man."One word more:. Don’t imagine that' when you are a senior“or "when the time comes” you will' be able to polish up yourpersonality like shining a pair of shoes. You simply can’t do it that way-, any- more than you can put off going to school until you find the need of knowing something, Or put off football prac­tice until the game is on.
Go over the personal items again, one by one, be frank about . it, and then make a personal inventory of your own 'characteris­tics. ‘ It may hurt a bit, but try it!

From the Fence j
We have received another letter, 
with which we had nothing to do. 
We offer it for your approval, or 
disapproval. The author, if we arc 
right is our guess, is a very cute 
little.boy from our own home town. 
Maybe the guess is wrong, but it 
looks good to me. The letter 
Dear Mr. From-the-Fencc
(With the Steele pickets):
Many days is it now that I have 
been considering writing to 'you. 
In the spring a young man’s fancy, 
you know, turns -to what the girls 
have been thinking of all winter. 
Yes, "you have guessed it. I am 
hopelessly in love. Hopelessly I 
say because she’s a Sigma Nu girl, 
What’ll I do, Mr. Fence? I have 
enclosed a stamped envelope for 
your reply. I know you will be 
able to solve my problem, because 
you are a man of the world, and 
have had much experience (at this 
point those loud birds are heard 
from the wings, Mr. Fence takes 
a bow and I continue).
Last week I saw a certain S. P. 
E. * trimming his mustache (I’ve 
heard that they’re the pride of 
physics students) and he was all 
excited getting ready for a date to 
go to the Stanley. I wish my girl 
would be Whoozit once in a while. 
Maybe we’d go some place then. 
While I’m talking about physics 
students, I think (pardon me for 
giving advice Avhen it was not 
solicited) that it would be perfectly 
all right for Miss Sample to re­
quest the removal of such a bar­
barous underbush from the upper 
lip of said physicist. (Now, Floy, 
-you may go ahead, feeling yourself 
justified in doing, so, after my 
kindly advice).
Perhaps this will be somewhat 
off the subject, Mr. Fence, but I 
thought maybe you would like to 
print it in the Tartan. Schenley 
8230 and Pcnhurst 7132 arc good 
phone numbers. Tell the fellows to 
ask for Dot at the first and Doris 
at the second. Give my name as 
reference. Ahem! Well, perhaps 
they hadn’t better, I forgot about 
something.
By the way, Mr. Fence, no more 
wisecracks about Chrysler and the 
Cathedral of Learning.
Since coming here, I have seen 
you walking on the campus quite 
often with a cute little fellow. 
Some one told me his name was 
Russ Ivambach. Tell me, is that 
the self-same Kambach of Kam- 
bach act fame? My, my, who 
would have thought such a tiling.
I was just looking over the 
names of the Tartan staff, and no­
ticed that Dorothy Yingling is one 
of the secretarial assistants. Is she 
that vivacious little girl that I see 
walking across the cut every morn­
ing with Frank Foote and Ed
Lewis? I’d like to meet her, Mr. 
Fence.
One »more question and then I'll 
be finished. I airi 21 years old, 
have freckles, red hair and big
feet, how much should I weigh,
and if so what should I do to
reduce?
Thank you for bearing with me 
this far. I sign my code name, 
Martin Luther.
We wish to thank the author, but 
refuse to answer his questions. 
They arc too much for us.
Random shots and ran don 
thoughts. Rudy Vallcc still per­
sists in advertising his beloved fra­
ternity by playing Violets at least 
once a week. If lie keeps this up, 
most any of these warm spring
days will probably find James
Aloysius Corrigan and Dave Gen- 
ter out on the cut chasing butter­
flies and picking dandelions.
Despite recent cold weather, a 
couple of Carnegie’s likely sopho­
mores are doing their best to fool 
both the robins and the rest of the 
campus. The black and white
sport shoeS of Wee Willie Reed of 
Dallas, Texas, and Roland Delaney 
Furlong of McKeesport, Pa., cer­
tainly blended well with the snow 
flakes of last Wednesday, while
that fanciful necktie belonging to 
Harry Tuthcrford Wall could never 
blend with anything.
We are again in the midst of 
deciding just which one of our 
many fair lassies shall reign over 
us during the coming Carnival 
Week. On the initial ballot, Pansy 
Murdoch led yvith Neil Russell a 
close second. Heaven only knows 
what the future will bring.
Someone has asked us just how 
it is possible for the little bit of a 
chicken which appears at the end 
of this column, to say “cluck! 
cluck!” Our only answer is that 
we have always found that the 
baby_ chickens are the ones most 
capable oi doing the unusual things.

Think It Over
Recent events in the Republic 
of Haiti have served to expose to 
public gaze a tragically weak spot 
in the armour of the Negro in the 
Western world in particular, and a 
missing link in the chain connect­
ing the dark millions everywhere. 
Those of us who are prone to flat­
tery and given over to self-con­
gratulation, never tire of pointing 
with pride to what we call the re­
markable progress made by the 
Negro in America since Emancipa­
tion.* * * *
However, the common yardstick 
by which we measure this so-rcallcd 
progress, is one that takes into 
consideration only those efforts of 
the Negro that mark the inevitable 
appcarancc among us of a relatively 
small group of Negroes who suc­
ceed in business and in the profes­
sions. In other words, we measure 
our progress by our bank deposits, 
the number of professional men 
and women we develop, the amount 
of rfcal estate values possessed by 
our group,, and by the enterprises 
over which we exercise a degree of 
control. That these arc important 
milestones on the road to equality 
and social respect in a world rest­
ing upon economic power, not 
even a genuine idealist can success­
fully deny. Nevertheless, they do 
not constitute the. only important 
meters by which the forward and 
upward march of any race or group 
should be gauged. What docs it 
profit a man if lie gains the whole 
world only to suffer the loss of 
his soul thereby, is as sound a 
truism today as in the days when 
first uttered.* * * *
In our scramble for some of this 
world’s goods, the Negro has lost 
much of the idealism and spiritual 
fervor that buoyed him up under 
a pyramid of pain known as chat­
tel slavery. The songs that once 
came rolling out from the heart 
and soul of the black cotton pick­
ers—the field hand—to find a place 
in the spiritual store-house of the 
world, have ceased to roll. That 
wide stretch of imagination which 
at once bounded the Negro out 
of the corn fields of the South 
“out across Jordan" into “heaven” 
has been narrowed down to a “suc­
cess” outlook. Under capitalism, 
idealism and even hope must bend 
the knee.
The weak spot which the Haiti­
an affair discloses is located in the 
realm of Negro newspapers. There 
are in the United States approxi­
mately' 250 Negro publications. Most 
of the news- which these papers and 
magazines carry is gleaned from 
white newspapers and magazines. 
This is thrice true with regard to 
what is happening in Haiti. Ex­
cept in local matters which have 
no appreciable significance to the 
race as a whole, White America 
edits the Negro newspaper and 
therefore shapes the policy of the 
Negro race. In other words, like 
our economic life, control at the 
source of news production and dis­
tribution is in alien hands; a re­
reading of the dispatches recently 
carried about Haiti in Negro news­
papers will bear this out.
It seems to me that whatever 
obstacles in the past stood in the 
way of Negro editors and publish­
ers collectively to establish a gen­
uine, efficient and up-to-dat« news 
gathering and distributing agency, 
the turn of events in the world to­
day demands it, and its practica­
bility and usefulness are beyond 
dispute.
The plight of the black man to­
day in all lands places upon the 
shoulders of Negro editors in 
America a duty which they . cannot 
much longer shirk. That duty 
calls for the organization of a gen­
uine effective and modern interna­
tional news gathering and distrib 
uting agency. Such an agency can 
render profitable scrvicc not alopc 
to Negro newspapers, but to the 
white press as well. What a differ­
ent story would have come to the 
world from Haiti if the combined 
Negro newspapers of America had 
on the scene there a James Weldon 
Johnson, a Walter White, or a J 
X. Rogers. ’
The Associated Negro Press as 
at present functioning cannot,ad­
equately meet the requirements of 
the situation. For it, like most 
Negro organizations with any 
promise, has become largely an 
adjunct to our reigning political 
house and is used acfcordingly.

PRINTING NOTES
Mr. Clyde Fellows, advertising 
production manager of Ketchum, 
McLeod and Grove, Inc., presented

GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.
WILL PRESENT MOTION 
AND SOUND PICTURE
At S o'clock this evening in the 
Union the General Electric Com­
pany, through the auspices of the 
Welding Department, will present 
a motion and sound picture de­
picting atomic hydrogen welding. 
Atomic hydrogen welding should 
not be confused with the ordinar 
oxy-hydrogcn welding. In this case 
an electric arc is used to break up 
hydrogen into the atomic state. 
The atomic hydrogen and the elec­
tric arc are then used in a com 
bincd welding process. It has cost 
the school about $250 to bring this 
picture so it will be well worth 
attending. Mr. Cole, district man 
agcr of the General Electric Com­
pany, will be on hand to explain 
the process and answer questions. 
This process is particularly ap­
plicable to the welding of light 
materials such as aluminum.

CONCERT SEASON TO 
CLOSE AT Y. M. H. A.
The current musical concert sea­
son at the Y. M. and W. H. A. 
.will draw to a close next Sunday 
night when the "Y” Choral Society, 
under the direction of Harvey Gaul, 
gives its second conccrt of the 
season.
Ruth Breton, violinist and favor­
ite of two continents, who will'ap­
pear as guest soloist, has regis­
tered unquestioned success with 
such, organizations as the New 
York Philharmonic, the Philadel­
phia Orchestra and tho Cincinnati 
Symphony.“ She is one of the in 
creasing number of distinguished 
concert artists who have received 
their entire musical education in 
this country. Her first teacher was 
her father; later she studied with 
Frank Kneisel, and ultimately with 
Leopold Auer.
On the program selected for the 
occasion are several classical num­
bers, two Russian folk songs, a
Palestinian folk song, a Negro 
Spiritual, and an original cantata,
by Harvey Gaul, with words by his 
wife, Avery Gaul, well known
novelist and short story writer.
The original cantata by Harvey
Gaul will be sung- for the first
time.
The concerts given by this
choral are enthusiastically attended 
by music lovers here. J. Fred
Lissfelt, Sun-Tcle music critic, 
stated: "If this chorus did nothing 
further, than sing their songs, there­
by bringing to our public a treasure 
of infinite value and beauty, we
should rest content." Carnegie
Teclj students who attend the 
Sunday evening conccrt in the
Morris Kaufmann auditorium will 
derive much pleasure from the pre­
sentation.
The faculty of Sw^arthmore Col­
lege temporarily suspended two 
upper-classmen and deprived fifty 
others of their right to cut classes 
as a result of a freshmen hazing 
party.
THISTLEDOWN
Some Letters
Dear old Cardo: As you know, 
Rodger and I drove out to the 
farm last Saturday night, because 
Rodger insisted that he could not 
spend Sunday in the city, and I, 
for the moment, was tired of femi­
nine companionship. Sunday aft­
ernoon Rodger took me out into 
the barns with him to watch the 
milking. I was entertained there 
by seeing a fresh eolored country 
girl milking into one of the shin­
iest milk pails I have ever seen. 1 
was glad of my opportunity to ob­
serve the behavior of a natural 
beauty in low, rustic life, and how 
she would receive the notice I was 
taking of her, which I found af­
fected the color of her face in the 
same way that a new, pretty piece 
of flattery affects a co-cd. I thought 
I would write you this before 1 
forgot it, as it may suggest to you 
some thoughts for a paper on 
blushing. Will.
dear- sir i am a inmate of warden 
.mocklaw’s jail i liked your little 
story about reggie which you 
wrote last fall bccause i always read 
good litcrachure. Please sir could you 
send me some tobacco and another 
Story. It is cold and damp here 
waiting to be hung and i feel side. 
Hoping you arc the same, yours 
for good literature, like you wright, 
Mug Stcnchstrong.
Dear Thistledown: Some time
when you arc writing about the
Grill, will you put it into print 
whether six pieces of pickle on a 
leaf of lettuce makes a salad? 
That's what they give us for lunch 
at the Inn. Yours, Molly Fresh­
man.
Dear Thistcdown: Don't deny
that it was you we saw eating 
cookies in_ Margaret Morrison on 
Exhibition Night. And we saw 
you cotnc back an hour later and 
try to get some more, too.
T rudic.
Dear Dizzy: Is this story that
I hear about you true, that the 
editor first discovered that you 
came from New York one night in 
the Grill when he asked you what 
a rhomboid was and you replied 
that of course a rum boid is a 
boid that is wet?
—James Ii. W.
Mr. Thistledown: Some time
when you want a trifle to fill up a 
column with, by inserting this you 
will greatly please and oblige a 
student who never makes mo^c 
than a C on a theme, but who's; 
literary aspirations will be mighti­
ly bolstered up by seeing this in 
print. Your admirer, if need be 
through thick and thin, Ralph 
Plcbc.

Dear Cardo: It will be ncccssary 
for you to write me a letter with 
information about yourself before 
I can fix it up.

RUBE GOLDBERG SAYS COL­LEGE SPIRIT IS THE BUNK
"[ niost certainly think that col­lege spirit in its true, native, poetic 
sense is the bunk. Now, wait! Don’t hit me. Let me explain," 
Rube Goldberg acts out to define 
college spirit."First let me say, that I am con­cerned only with old age, bald- headed, gouty, bulging bodied col­lege spirit—the kind you should find in the old graduate who grasped his diploma twenty or twenty-five years ago and swore everlasting allegiance to every blade of grass that lifted its academic head upon the campus green. This is the only phase of the subject 
that is really important."The pyrotechnic display of love 
for the dear old alma mater dur­ing the undergraduate days must be taken as a matter of course. The undergraduate, unless lie has 
premature hardening of the arter­ies, cannot help being infected with the virus of loud, glorious en­thusiasm for the flaming black and blue, or was it the iridescent green and white? The so-callcd( under­graduate college spirit isn’t spirit 
at all. It is merely a healthy dis­play of temporary patriotism due 
principally to proximity. The col­lege boy is on a four-year educa­
tional spree before going out into the world to pay his own rent. It is'his college because lie cats 
in it, sleeps in it, plays in it, and studies in it. He naturally thinks it is the best college in the world, if for no other reason simply be­
cause it is his college."Did you ever meet any person who said your radio was better than his, or your car woi\ld go up a hill faster than his, or your dentist could pull teeth better than his? Not on your life. So, it is no surprising phenomenon that a college student likes his college— 
yea, loves it. It is much more ex­pensive than a radio or a car or a dentist and one should be that much more proud of it—if that is 
possible."You may say that when a boy is willing to break his neck for his collcgc on the football field, he ig displaying the highest form of college spirit. I don’t think so. lie is breaking his neck because he loves the glamour of it and 
because all the other fellows are breaking their necks and because 
lie i- just a big healthy kid who likes to break his neck. I. used to try to kill myself, making points 
for my side in a sand-lot football game and f don’t believe 1 ever displayed, any hysterical love for sand-lots. It is the spirit of want­ing to win rather than wanting to express a love for good old 
Whereisit.“The whole thing is relative. If there is any such thing as collcgc spirit, it is the four-year variety. After that, it is just like belonging to a lodge, only you go once a year, if you go at all, instead of every Thursday night. And then it’s pretty hard to get good beer.”

Intcrcollcgiatc Clips
Three University of . Oklahoma 
deans recently said Thomas .Edison 
was hardly qualified to criticize 
colleges when he had never at­
tended one himself. Their opinions 
followed the inventor’s statement 
on his eighty-third birthday that: 
“The way things stand today I 
should advise a student to enter 
business upon high school gradua­
tion rather than go to a univer­
sity.”
Speaking about typographical 
gems, the one that appeared re­
cently in the B. & M. of Musking­
um Collcgc was no slouch. In the 
recital announcement the songs to 
be given included one entitled, "O 
Rest in the Lard.” We wonder if 
they meant “O Vest in the Lard." 
It was something like the one in 
the Miami Student in October, 
"Hell, What of it, Come to Chap­
el.” (No, Muskingum, there is no 
honor among newspaper colum­
nists.)
Lehigh • University men will hold 
an intcrfratcrnity bull-scssion in 
the near future to discuss Lehigh 
improvements. We must admire 
the frankness of the Bcthlchcmitcs 
in nahiing the confab. At Carnegie, 
we have many such sessions, but 
they go on the books as this or 
that club meeting, and sometimes 
they have course numbers. At Le­
high a prize will be awarded the 
best bull-thrower; at Carnegie, ac­
tivities keys serve the nurposc.
