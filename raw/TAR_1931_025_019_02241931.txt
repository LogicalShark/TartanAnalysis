DRAMA DEPARTMENT TO PRESENT CARROLL FITZHUGH’S PLAY, “THE 
MAN WHO MARRIED A RICH WIFE”
Comedy Shows Change of 
Man’s Character by 
Wealth
PLAY IS SOCIAL COMEDY
Little Theatre Production 
Opens Saturday 
or Monday
In keeping with this money- 
crazed civilization of modern times, 
the drama- department will present 
for one week Carroll Fitzhugh’s 
play VThe Man Who Married a 
Rich Wife," beginning either. Sat­
urday, February 28, or Monday, 
March 2. The author shows a 
young man content to lead a simple 
unassuming life but when, through 
his wife, he inherits a large fortune, 
he can not rise above it and is 
crushed by its great weight. Where­
as he was satisfied before, now all 
his ideas of life are completely up 
set. The sudden acquisition of 
t;wealth docs «not affect many people 
hut for others it has dire results. 
Although Mr. Fitzhugh’s play is a 
comedy, the theme in general is 
extremely serious;
Fitzhugh Writes Many Plays
, ¦ Mr. Fitzhugh has had a number
of his plays produced at Carnegie.
\\ The drama department' staged the 
(first production of his first play, 
“The Lioness,” .in 1924. In succeed­
ing j'ears, his plays,' “Smart Alccl< 
and Amaryllis,” “The Lady and the 
.Carpenter,” and "The Mountains of 
Bether” were presented in the 
Little Theater. Practically all of
- flylr. Fitzhugh’s plays arc comedies 
of social life. This particular one 
“The Man Who ‘Married a Rich 
,Wife,” Mr. Fitzhugh said in an in­
terview given last week, is intended 
to show the development and 
change of character though the ac- 
quisi'tion of wealth. Mr. . Fitz­
hugh is a prominent member of a 
well known Pittsburgh family and 
has lived here always. He is known 
in dramatic circles as president of 
the Stage and Play Society of 
Pittsburgh and lias, published a 
volume of short plays.

EUROPEAN SCIENTISTS 
TO ATTEND THIRD COAL 
CONGRESS HELD HERE
Amherst Publication 
Praises Carnegie 
Kilties
The “Amhersf Student,” in its 
publication of December 18, 1930, 
highly ’ praised the Carnegie Kiltie 
Band. The article states, “Perhaps 
the most unique college band in 
the country is the famed Kiltie 
Band of Carnegie Tech. It makes 
all the football trips and presents a 
striking appearance in Scottish 
kilts. Besides the unusual mode of 
attire, the band has gained a wide 
reputation for their perfection of 
musical organization.”
The band will play at an annual 
affair to be held1 at the Emory M. 
E. Church, Highland Avenue, on 
March 15 at 8 o’clock. Before the 
services the band will be entertain­
ed at dinner by the young ladies of 
the congregation.
Because of the graduation of 
Frank Mueller, present drum major 
of the band, a call is being issued 
for tall men, freshmen and soph­
omores onl)-, who are interested 
in the vacant position. Applicants 
for the position should appear at

FAMOUS CARNEGIE 
> GRADUATE KILLED
Announcement of Confer­
ence Warmly Received 
by Technologists
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
will be host to some of the finest 
scientific minds of Europe next fall 
during the Third International 
Conference on Bituminous Coal, 
according to President Thomas S. 
Baker, who returned to his office 
last week after a six weeks’ sur­
vey of the coal situation abroad.
Dr. Baker found that the an­
nouncement of the third meeting 
was -warmly received by European 
fuel technologists, -many of whom 
plan to deliver papers in Pitts­
burgh next November. Despite the 
deplorable condition of the coal 
situation throughout the world, re­
search is going rapidly forward in 
European countries.
In an ’ interview last week Dr. 
Baker said: "The public can hard­
ly realize the immense amount ot 
research that is being carried on 
in connection with soft coal in all 
countries of the world which mine 
coal and indeed, in some countries 
which have no fuel resources.
"On the tour which I recently 
completed, I have found that the 
most interesting and valuable work 
is being done in Germany. In 
spite of the current political unrest 
and lamentable economic situation, 
laboratories with the most effi­
cient staffs and equipment are pro-* 
ceeding patiently- and in some cases 
brilliantly with their studies of all 
the phases of combustion aiid^. the 
utilization . of combustibles.
"In France, coal research- is not 
so concentrated as in Germany or 
England. There are a few men 
who are doing exceedingly good 
work but their-; efforts are often 
not co-ordinated.
“While the Third Conference will 
be- devoted primarily to scientific 
questions as to the processes 
which deal, with the development 
and utilization of the. by-products 
of the distillation pf . coal, some 
attention will be given to the 
economic aspects of the industry.
“In England and the United 
States the coal situation is des­
perate. If a more rational method 
could be evolved of dealing with 
our vast resources, we should go' 
a long way toward relieving the 
present crisis.”
Dr. Baker visited France, Bel­
gium, England, Germany, Czecho­
slovakia and Australia. He found 
that the conference is as well or 
perhaps better .’known in Europe 
than in America. Delegates from 
Spain, Italy, the Scandinavian 
countries, Jugoslavia, Poland, Jap­
an and Africa are expected to at­
tend the meeting.
Norman Thomas Will 
Talk At “Y” On “Why 
Freedom Matters”
Norman Thomas, noted lecturer 
and Socialist candidate for Presi­
dent in 1928, will speak before the 
Pittsburgh section, National Coun­
cil of Jewish Women, this evening 
in Y. M H. A. at 8:15.
It is in response to a popular 
demand which has been expressed 
for the privilege of hearing Mr. 
Thomas that the Council, contrary 
to customary regulations, will hold 
its February meeting in the eve­
ning and open it to the general 
public. There will be a nominal 
admission fee for non-members.
Mr. Thomas is known and lov­
ed by millions of Americans in all 
walks of life, by workers who look 
for him for. inspiration and guid­
ance to betterment, and by intel-

will form a convenient arrangement 
for receiving and accommodating the 
large group of guests.
The prom will be a. closed affair; 
only junior women of Margaret 
Morrison and Arts School and sen­
ior and alumnae guests may attend. 
The alumnae will. be charged $7.00, 
and they arc asked to notify the 
committee immediately if they intend 
to come. All. Seniors who did not 
attend last year-will also be assessed 
$7.00. Those who paid $5.00" last 
year without attending the affair
will only be charged $2.00. The junior 
tickets for the prom this year cost 
$14.00, and the payments arc divided 
into three installments. The final
assessment will be $5.00 and, as 
before, may ‘be paid to the com­
mittee in chargc of the tickct sale. 
Beginning the first of March, repre­
sentatives of the tickct committee 
will be stationed in convenient places 
in Margaret Morrison and Arts
School to receive the final install­
ments. Junior girls will be chargcd 
$5.00 if •they do not attend the prom, 
for it is considered the undertaking 
of tlic junior class as a whole.
The grand march, which will begin 
at 11:30, will be lead by Helen, 
Prosser, vice president of the Arts 
School Junior class, and a student in

The man credited with develop­
ing the first practical alternating 
current radio tube, the device that 
made possible the all-electric rc-’ 
ceivers of .today, a graduate of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology; 
died February 9, a victim of his 
passion for research in clectricitv.
He was William J. Kimmcl, an 
expert in radio research for the 
Wcstinghousc Electric and Manu­
facturing Company. lie was 
working on tests for a new trans­
former, • when an accident occur- 
rcd which resulted in his death.
“Bill,” as lie was affectionately 
known here,- was one of 'Carnegie’s 
most outstanding students. He 
graduated in 1926 with'a degree in 
physics, and later went to Har­
vard for spccial training in radio 
research on a scholarship. He was 
a member of the track team and 
cross country team for two years, 
and won his letter in rifle. • Actii'e 
in campus affairs, he was alumni 
editor of the Tartan and manag­
ing editor of Tri-Publications, be­
sides w o r k i n g on the Campus 
Week committee. He was a mcm: 
her of Kappa Sigma Rho, now 
Lambda Chi Alpha, and the “C” 
Club.
Upon his , graduation, Kimmcl 
went to work for Wcstinghousc 
as spccial research agent. While, 
there lie devised the first prac­
tical alternating current tube, 
overcoming the obstacles of quick­
ly fluctuating! voltages. His tube 
was known as the US26. After 
his year at Harvard, lie came back 
to Wcstinghousc as an expert in 
radio oscillatory . and amplifying 
circuits.

DR. ROSS DISCUSSES SITUATION 
OF FRENCH WINE PRODUCERS
(Editor’s Note: Professor
Ross of the Econmic Dcpart- 
mcrit recently received the de­
gree of Dpctor of Philosophy 
in Political Science at the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh. I-Ie did 
his graduate work for the de­
gree at Columbia University 
and spent three summers in 
France studying the French 
system of regulation and pro­
tection of the wine industry, 
which served as the subject of 
his dessertation.)
(Dr. Ross is now engaged in 
writing a text book ok the govern­
ments of Europe. At the clQse of 
the second semester he will go 
abroad to study the recent political 
developments in Italy, England, 
France, arid Russia, for the pur­
pose of bringing his treatments of 
the governments of these countries 
as nearly up to date as possible.)
Today France and the United 
States arc engaged in two diamet­
rically opposed programs. We arc 
trying to deal a death blow to 
drink, while France is doing all in 
her power to nourish and expand 
the liquor industry. The French 
program, however, is very closcly 
related to our «own efforts in the 
field of agricultural relief, for she, 
too, is confronted with agrarian de­
pression; and wine, which ranks 
second in value of agricultural 
products is the worst sufferer. The 
malady is overproduction'; while 
our elevators ,arc bursting with 
wheat, French cellars are flooded 
with wine, for which there are few 
buyers.
Wine growers’ crises are not
new to France, nor to the French 
government. In meeting the pres­
ent crises, France has the advan­
tage of long experience with a 
vast system of regulation for the 
protection of her wine industry. 
In 1907, the agrarian population 
of southern France, which is prin­
cipally engaged in wine production, 
were so incensed by a three-year 
period of low prices that they 
openly rebelled against the gov­
ernment of the day. As many as 
500,000 men gathered in single 
mass meetings. They drove some 
of the government - functionaries 
out of four departments on the 
Mediterranean, and pillaged a num­
ber of prefectures by way of let­
ting Premier Clemenceau know 
that they wished the government 
to do something about the disas­
trously low prices of their wine 
crops.
Clemenceau immediately respond­
ed with cavalry . charges and volleys 
of rifle fire which, needless to say, 
were not exactly economic solu­
tions to the problem. True agri­
cultural relief came more gently 
and unobtrusively over a long 
period of years between 1907 and 
1930 in the form of legislative pro­
vision for the protection of thtf 
industry in co-operation with small 
groups of grapc^ growers callcd 
syndicates. By working through a 
complicated system of judicial and 
legislative procedure these syndi­
cates were able to eliminate fraudu­
lent wine from the market and 
increase the average price of wine 
in the years 1907 to 1922 fifty per

Plcbc regulations were formally 
abolished for the year by the vote 
of Student Council at its meeting 
on Tuesday night, February 17. 
Frank Mueller, chairman of the 
Plcbc Regulations committee; made 
the suggestion owing to the fact 
that the sophomores have failed to 
enforce strictly the regulations this 
year. It was also decided to try 
to find some permanent settlement 
for next year.
John J. Boyle was appointed 
editor-in-chief of the Tartan for the

he first gained national attention. 
Front his youth he has been, where 
things are happening or where lie 
was making tilings happen. 1-Ie has 
engaged in occupations varying
from, boxing to working in a steel 
mill. I-Ie helped to develop the 
survey of the steel industry by re­
ligious and social leaders that
lirought about Important’ changes. •
Because of his organizing ability, 
his skill its a speaker, and his zeal 
for the Prohibition cause, Dan 
Poling was nominated candidate
for governor of Ohio on the Pro­
hibition party platform.
Dr. Poling will probably be best 
known in history through his pre­
sentation of the Crusade with 
Christ, a new youth movement with 
objectives in evangelism, world 
peace, and Christian citizenship. 
The Crusade has become the basis 
of young people’s program in.prac­
tically all Protestant denominations. 
No conception of the causes most 
urgently demanding Christian ac­
tion has ever been more appealing 
to youth and age.
Many know Dr. Pdling through 
his books which arc convincing and 
interesting writings. Among ' his 
novels arc “The Furnace,” "The 
Heretic,” and "John of Oregon.”
The radio , on Sunday afternoons 
has brought the voice of Daniel 
Poling with his strong,' forccful, 
clear-cut messages all over A'nicr- 
ica. Earnest inquiries of young 
people fill the question box of this 
radio speaker and counsellor.'' He 
replies to questions directly, clear­
ly, and interestingly.
On the lecturc platform Dr. 
Poling cannot be surpassed. A 
New Jersey c/litor writes: "Logical 
fairness, thorough mastery of his 
subject, and oratorical skill all be­
long to this famed speaker.” He 
is- possessed ot a magnetic person­
ality, and his messages arc friend­
ly. Audiences in all the United 
States, in Europe, and in Canadian 
cities have responded to his un­
forgettable challenge to the best 
that is in them.

A banquet for the twenty-three 
freshmen who registered at mid-term

Dan Gregory’s Southern 
Orchestra Will Play 
For Affair
TICKETS DISTRIBUTED
Fraternities to Give 
Breakfasts After 
Dance
Friday evening, Mr rch 6, has been 
chosen as the- date of the inter-
fraternity formal this year, which is 
to be held in the main ballroom on 
the seventeenth floor of the William 
Penn Hotel.
A very popular Southern orchestra, 
led by Dan Gregory, will furnish 
the music from 9 until 2. The com­
mittee in chargc has been quite
fortunate in obtaining Dan Gregory, 
as can be testified by the way in
which his music has been received at 
many Southern colleges, including 
Tennessee, V. M. I., and Georgia
Tech. The orchestra will not be 
making its first appearance in Penn­
sylvania, however, for it has recent­
ly played for au affair held at Penn 
State.
Favors Chosen
Favors different from anything in 
the past have been purchased, and will 
be distributed upon entering the ball­
room oil the night of the formal. 
Adequate checking facilities, far 
superior to that’ had at any time 
before, have been arranged. '
As has been the cusi'om each 
year, .decorations will consist of ban­
ners from each fraternity on the 
campus arranged around the balcony 
of the ballroom. The' fraterniti'cs are 
asked to turn in their banners to 
Carson at the Sigma Phi Epsilon 
fraternity house immediately to have 
the banners hung in. the ballroom in 
time.
Tickcts Distributed
Tickets for the affair have al­
ready been distributed among' the 
various fraternities, and are being 
sold for $5.00. After the formal 
the majority , of tl.ic fraternities will 
be giving breakfasts at their re­
spective houses.
Chaperones will include Mr, and 
Mrs. A. 1:',. Riscdorph, Dr. and Mrs. 
Ncellcy, and Mr, and Mrs. K. V. 
Davis. The patrons will include Dr. 
Baker, Dean Green, Dean and Mrs. 
Tarbcll, and Dean Kecble.
The intcrfraternity ‘.’formal is an 
annual affair open to all fraternity 
men. Last year it was held at the 
Schenley Hotel, and it is partly due 
to the large attendance there that 
this year’s formal is being given at 
the William Penn ballroom, where a 
larger number can be accommodated.
At an intcrfraternity council meet­
ing held last Saturday, it was an­
nounced that second semester rush­
ing for new registrants will begin 
Saturday, April 11. The same regu­
lations will hold as for the first 
semester season. Alpha Phi Delta 
social fraternity has petitioned the 
council to become a non-voting mem­
ber. A committee was appointed to 
investigate this matter.

SPORTS AND ALUMNI NEWS
COACH "BOB” WADDELL has been hon­
ored by an appointment to the National Inter- : 'collegiate Coaches Association. His position,
I with three other prominent football leaders of the country, includes the task of considering and voting upon the proposed changes in the grid- 
iron etiquette* Coach' ''Chick” Meehan, of N. Y. U., is president of the association with rcprc- Jiff sentatives from the East, Mid-West, Far AVest, 
||p| and South to, complete his committee. *****
ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF THE basketball tcam’s 
rcccnt eastern invasion in the matter of games won and lost 
was not as successful as might have been desired the boys 
made a credible impressoin on the eastern scribes. While 
New York, Coach Hogan was interviewed by a reporter from 
one of the Big Town’s leading papers, who in answer to Buzz’s 
query, stated that the Carnegie five was one of the finest out­
fits that had played in New York this season and complimented 
the Plaid’s Coach on the fine showing his team had made. 
*****
HOPES FOR A PLAID VICTORY against Pitt Friday 
were given a severe blow when Bob Smith suffered a severely 
wrenched ankle during the St. John’s erfcotmter. The game was 
played on a floor which had been polished for dancing, and this 
coupled with the rather rough tactics of the contest made the 
footing far from secure. There is still a possibility that “Smitty” 
might play at least for a short while against Pitt, but “Bert 
Munhall is making no promises.
THE SUPER-GUARDING of Jimmy Fergus was the re­deeming feature of the trip. In 
4 the Army game he was pitted against Stecker, the West Pointer’s 
captain, who has been named as likely candidate for All-American forward. 
Throughout this contest “Jim” out­played the Army ace at every turn 
and held him to two field goals. His
performances against St. John’s andTemple were also the outstanding individual efforts from the Carnegie standpoint.

THE COURTMEN OF ¦ KISKI cori firmed their previous 
victory over the freshmen by a similar 27 to 24- decision on the 
Saltsburg floor last Friday. The play resembled that staged 
by the teams in their first encounter in the Skibo gym.
At the half-time, the score showed a three-point advantage
for the Scotch youngsters, but an .exciting time followed which 
was enjoyed to the greatest extent by the prep school boys,
I fowever, Coach Buckley’s men threw a scare into the fray 
when a late rally netted them enough points to place the Kiski 
itcs in the background. At this time the trialers unleashed ; volley of shots, two of which found a path through the basket These points gave the necessary total that spelled defeat for •lie Plebes,

THE FIRST HOME APPEARANCE of the Tartan boxers 
»vas undoubtedly received with more enthusiasm than the school 
officials had expected. The Syra­
cuse pugilists, sporting one of the 
best outfits in the cast, gained a 
decisive victory over the Plaids, but the showing of the Tartans 
against fighters of championship , calibre was far from disheartening. 
The next home match, scheduled with West Virginia, will afford boxing fans the opportunity.to compare the fighters after 
having gained more experience with the opponents of their irst showing, in which the Mountaineers defeated them 6
The interest shown by last Saturday’s spectators must be encouraging not only to the school officials, but also to the Tartan boxers.f *****
VARSITY SWIMMERS have.drawn a tough foe for their 
first exhibition in the home waters. Our Panther friends will 
appear with their usual array of a well-balanced combination 
which is quite capable of having things their own way Wed­
nesday afternoon. The freshmen teams of both schools will 
tangle in a meet! of their own at the same time. With a great 
deal to gain, the Plebes arc sure to pass up a few opponents. > 
Western Reserve tankmen are due for a Saturday afternoon 
tubbing at the expense of the Plaid natators. This annual meet 
is in the home pool with the Plebes breaking water against the 
Academy High. Their good showing in last week’s events 
should place the yearlings in a winning position.
Tartan Five Drops 
Three Games On 
Eastern Invasion
Lose Thrilling Contests 
to Army, St. Johns 
and Temple U.
Last week, for the first time 
this season, the Carnegie basket­
ball team lost three consecutive 
games, falling before the strong 
attacks of Army, St. John's and 
Temple.
Opening their Eastern invasion 
at the Military Academy, tile Tar­
tan five clearly outplayed the 
Army lads throughout the contest 
but lost 27-26, mainly due ,to their 
lack of experience with the anti- 
whistle blowing tactics of the 
Eastern officials.
The Plaid got off to an #irly 
lead, which , they held until the 
middle of the .second half. At this 
point the Army five started sink­
ing them from mid-court,. and be­
fore they could be checked they 
had gained a six-point lead. The 
Tartans put on a last minute spurt, 
but failed to overtake the West 
Pointdrs, the game ending 27-26.
After a day’s rest from the Army 
game, the team took on the strong 
St. John’s College five and lost 24- 
18. St. John's is regarded as the 
strongest team 'in the East by 
many leading critics, having 
but one game in two years.
Having acquainted thcnisclvcs 
with the rough tactics of the last 
the Plaid -quintet managed to lead 
the Brooklyn boys through the ma­
jor portion of t,he first half, hold­
ing the lead 12-11 at half-time. 
The slippery condition of the floor 
and the rough tactic^ of the home 
team proved too much for the 
weary wanderers from Skiboj and 
by using a delayed offense the St, 
John's five piled up a 24-18 margin 
before the game ended.
Dreary from their first two
games and minus the services of 
Bob Smith, the Carncgians found 
themselves no match for the highly 
keyed up Tc'mple team and lost 
their, third game 52-25.
The Owls were primed to the 
minute fdr the Plaid and played 
a bang-up game throughoft 
the contest. Always one step
ahead of our boys, the Phila­
delphians took an early lead,
which they continued to incr 
until the game finally ended with 
the count standing 52-25' in their 
favor. The clean lilay of th 
Cherry and White am) the im 
proved' officiating. were in marked, 
contrast With the engagements of 
Ihc previous fcwv days.
No games arc on the schcdul 
for the Tartan quint this week un­
til the Pitt five is met in the sec­
ond game of the City Champion 
ship scries on the Stadium Jloor 
Friday evening.
Plebe Nalators Suffer 
First Defeat of Season 
At Cleveland Saturday
lost
The Plebes’ aspirations for a stain- 
ss swimming season were cast aside 
ith the 42-33 defeat administered 
by the University School of CIcvc- 
md last Saturday. A few "days
previous to this, the Plaid freshmen 
disposed , of the ' Alldcrdicc High 
School boys by a 52-16 score. This 
;ivcs the record a reading of two 
ins out of three meets to date. 
Alldcrdicc presented a team of 
air material that could not equal the 
strides of their more mature oppon­
ents. The fancy diving was the miss­
ing link in the string of first places 
taken by the Plebes. Although the
outcome of the meet was never in 
doubt, ihc high school boys forced 
the freshmen, to step out in the re­
lay, 100-yard free style, and breast 
stroke events. The 220-yard grind 
aroused no little interest with the 
first three swimmers crossing the 
finish in close order.
The Tartan yearlings plunged into 
tank full of trouble when they 
opposed the University School navi- 
jators in the lattcr’s pond. Both 
teams pounded the water with the ut­
most efforts, which brought about 
some races which contained an ele­
ment of real speed. Hostilities be­
gan with the 100-yard relay, the 
Plebes winning by a margin that 
was measured in inches. Incidentally 
the winning time showed a reduction 
of about three seconds from the 
pool record for that event.
Vonder Lanckcn encountered an 
unseen obstacle in the breast stroke 
which probably explains-his second 
place in that event. Thp race began 
as psual but the most promising op­
ponent did not appear till one length 
¡atcr. Although lie was practically iri- 
isible, it is certain that the prep 
school boy did swim the distancd, 
but it happened to be along tlie bot­
tom of the pool. This piece of 
strategy lead the surface swimmers 
to believe that everything w’as in 
order, and the surprise came when 
the subway swimmer appeared in the 
lead after the first turn. A elose 
race ended with Vonder Lanckcn in 
second place, followed by Denison.
Miller continued negotiations with 
an' easy first in the 100-yard and a 
sccond in the 50-yard free style. 
Bright flung himself around in 
great style to take sccond in the 
.fancy diving. Boyer earned a first 
in the back stroke and a third in 
the'220-yard free style. The Uni- 
ersity School clinched the .meet with 
. victory in the .final event,. 150- 
yard medley.

Four Swimming Meets At
Carnegie During Week
Swimming activities will come into 
full swing this week with four meets 
to be held in the Carnegie pool. A 
strong Pitt aggregation comes over 
on Wednesday,, the festivities begin­
ning at 4:30 p. m. The varsity and 
freshmen squads of each school will 
take . to the water. Favoritism 
weighs most heavily on the Pitt side 
in the varsity class, while the fresh­
men arc more evenly matched.
Saturday at 2:30 Coach Riscdorph’s 
squad will meet the natators from 
Western Reserve in the home waters. 
The Skibo’s 45-30 victory of last 
ear is proof enough that this meet 
will hold a special interest for those 
who like close races. At the same 
time on Saturday the Plebes will 
put on a side show with the Aca­
demy High School of Eric. The 
boys from the lake shore will bring 
some speed demons who are bound 
to maxc the freshmen, shake 
more than a leg if the latter cxpcct 
to win. There arc no admission re­
quirements for any of these meets.

finish the ( inter-collegiate finals in 
great style, , opened with a scries of 
hard punches in rapid succession, 
wearing Rcstainc out. “Mike,” having 
regained his bearings between rounds, 
opened the sccond stanza apparently 
fresh. Wollanin, timing his blows, 
sent him back into the ropes and 
delivered a hard one to the jaw on 
his rebound to finish, by a* technical 
knockout.
Pounccy, fighting Moran in the 
160 division, opened furiously, but 
was turned away by the Syracuse 
mitman wifli Mil tie trouble, the referee 
stopping ihc match toward the' mid­
dle of the sccond round.

The new list will be posted today by 
Ruth Phillips, .who has been assisted 
by Miss Marguerite Kupferberg, li­
brarian of the Iiut. Each member is 
requested to contributo fifteen cents, 
which sum—together, with the pro­
ceeds of a candy sale scheduled for 
the latter part of .March—r-will be 
used for establishing a library in the 
"Rcc” hall.
The officers of the club for the 
second semester arc ¡.'Esther Hanley, 
president; Kitty Mong, vice president 
and social chairman; and Hazel 
Gough, sccretary-treasurcr. Miss Ivup- 
fcrberg, who was recently chosen as 
club advisor, will be given a formal 
wclcomc at a tea to be given later 
in the semester.
ALUMNI
man 115 pound-aspirant, made a very 
creditable showing in his first ’.bout, 
giving the clever and experienced 
Jack Giachetti plenty- of trouble. 
Giachctti copped the verdict through 
all-around superior ring generalship. 
In the featherweight division, Union­
town again scored when Gianctti took 
a hard-fought decision over Atlas. 
The latter was most willing but 
-Gianetti was just too good.
Carnegie’s first .venture into boxing 
was greeted by a large and enthus­
iastic crowd, the attendance being 
estimated at over 1,000. In spite of 
the rules prohibiting demonstrations 
during the course of the bouts, the 
crowd would frequently forget it­
self and loud cheers and encourage­
ments could be heard.
All alumnae of Margaret Mor­
rison and Arts School are in­
vited to attend the Woman’s 
Junior Prom to be held in the 
William .Penn Hotel, March 20. 
The prioe of the tickets is $7 
per Couple. They may be ob­
tained from Janet McClelland, 
106 South Trenton avenue, Wil- 
kinsburg, Pa., Telephone Church- 
hill 6081.
The Prom this year promises 
to be one of the best ever held 
and as such should be of inter­
est to the alumnae.
Girl Swimmers To
Hold Water Circus
The Girls’, Swimming 'team will 
hold a Water Circus today at 
12:30 o’clock. They will play 
games and participate in novelty 
races and relays. Although only 
girls will be admitted- to the meet,- 
the water circus provides an ex­
cellent opportunity for the girls to 
show what they have been doing 
the past semester.
The swimming season is more 
than half over, but before its con­
clusion, Mary Jane Gray, manager, 
announces that the team will hold 
an exhibition meet on the evening 
of Gym exhibition night.

OUR UNIVERSE
Believe it or not, but the fact is 
Professors “Flunked” a test given 
by tb,eir students. ,This startling 
news comes from oive of the large 
colleges of the country where they 
do things. The students turned, the 
tables on their task masters, and
presto what a change. The highest 
grade made was 55.1 per cent. It 
is startling to find out that all the 
knowledge is not on the one side 
of the desk. Many students know 
more than their profs. Ask them, 
they’ll tell you so. Now I’m going 
to dope .out a.few questions to ask, 
and watch me put the KO with red 
pencil all o^er the answers. You
know, I delight in. such a situation. 
Bet they won’t make more than 30 
per cent on the paper.
Prohibition—no I don’t mean what 
you mean—I mean don’t cut the cor­
ners of the walks. That a great num­
ber of the walkers is doing it is no 
doubt the cause of the prohibition
which is evident by the'placing of
cut twigs across the muddy spots 
at the square corners of the walks. 
These corners have been cut so 
often that, all the grass has been 
plowed up and nothing but mod holes 
remain. It docsn!t look very good 
to ''have these branches placed at the 
ifltcrgections; rior does it look good 
to'iiave.' the mudv hbles', so let’s re­
solve to walk on the walks and not 
ctit corners* Somebody said that the 
walks should be ' rounded off in­
stead of squared off, well who knows, 
maybe if they were rounded off the 
rounds would be.cut and then there 
would be bigger- mud holes.
Just as I expected the Book Re­
viewer got busy and wrote a review 
on some of the .books which were 
read. This keeps me from' worrying 
about what I should read because 
they have all been read for me and 
I; get it in a digested form.
‘ I notice that there are some, pre­
cautions to be taken when parking 
cars on the Campus. But what is 
one to do "when lie ‘ doesn't have a 
car to park? I would like to have 
one for once, just to see what it is 
like. We are also told that there arc 
“Figgers” to prove that there arc 
“three feet. drivers!' on the Campus. 
I wonder what kind of drivers these 
arc. I would like to. get a good look 
at thgm. Why stop at three, foot 
drives when we have two foot stu­
dents? Well, maybe there is some 
justification for the “precaution1 
situation, and' the “three feet driver” 
condition. Lets, as the articles inti­
mate remember that “we is all brud- 
dcrs in dat great fraternity of the 
misty nights o£*;the night •students” 
and consider the, other fellow.
LOST AND FOUND
During the past week a, leather 
pocket-book containing money and 
auto driver’s license was’lost by a 
night student. Will the finder please 
leave this pocket-book at the receiv­
ing room, basement of Administration 
Hall so that it can be returned to 
the owner.
While on this subject we would 
like to call the attention of the night 
students to the function of this 
office. It is a convenience established 
to enable students to recover their 
lost articles. By the co-operation of 
the finder of lost articles on the. 
campus in bringing-the found articles 
to this office the: owners will be 
located and their property restored 
to them. W%e urge all night students 
finding articles to bright these arti­
cles promptly to the Receiving Room, 
Basement of Administration Hail; 
On the other hand, any night stu­
dent who has lost any article should 
apply at this office and inquire about 
his property. It may be there wait­
ing an owner. Reciprocity is an ex­
cellent thing to consider, so if you 
have found or lost anything on the 
Campus think of the -Receiving Room 
^ and' apply there.

We are living in an age in which 
ideas change rapidly. Hardly has 
a new idea taken root until it is 
superseded by a newer one. No 
less revolutionary has been man’s 
conceptions of the universe. It
has been a far cry from the im­
age of a universe made up of a flat 
plane, • bounded at the fringe by
the frontiers of new worlds all of
which were covered over’ with 
patch * of blue sky, to the present 
idea of an unimaginable number 
of electrical particles vibrating at 
a tremendous velocity in a fixed 
orbital path forming the ear.th and 
constituting within itself a unit of 
another such vibrating system com­
posed oJr>the sun, moon, stars and 
planets. 1
The pursuit of truth led to the 
development of philosophy, and out 
of philosophy grew the sciences. 
The world tired of playing with 
words and demanded tangible evi­
dence. The pendulum swung from 
pure thought to empirical facts. 
Now we find that the pendulum 
must swing back. In satisfying 
our desire for concrete facts we 
have neglected thought which is 
necessary in order to obtain a 
coherent glimpse of the mechanism 
of the universe.
Fortunately, there are men who 
arc able to swing frgm the realm 
of pure thought to the practical 
ideas and back again so often that 
in reality the two new points arc 
fused into one. Through the eyes 
of such men our knowledge is con­
stantly advanced. Today some- of 
the men who fall into this class 
are M’illikan, Einstein, Eddington, 
Thomson, Lorentz, and Minkow­
ski.
Miliikan and Thomson have led 
us to the practical determination 
of some of the properties of the 
smallest elements of water, the 
electron. Eddington has given to 
us the idea of the structure of 
our universe on a larger scale and 
which is encompassed within the 
field of astronomy. Lorentz and 
Minkowski have advanced theories 
in regard to some of our concep­
tions of- the fundamentals of the 
universe, such1 as time, space, 
gravitation, and light.. Close upon 
their heels has followed the work 
of Einstein. Not content with tlie 
evident lack of co-ordination as dis­
played in all work of a fundamen­
tal nature, lie has endeavored to 
so relate the basic conceptions 
that the transition from pure 
thought to concrete fact could be 
accomplished so perfectly that a 
union of the1 two could easily be 
brought about.
Newton, in studying matter in 
motion, evolved his theory of 
gravitation. In addition, he -was 
a profound student in the field of 
optics. In his work the necessity 
of forming a theory as to the na­
ture of light arose. This led to 
the formation of his corpuscular 
theory. Being of a philosophical 
turn of mind and having an almost 
infinite capacity for fundamental 
studies, lie. concluded that time and 
space possessed definite entities. 
Foucalt's researches undermined 
the corpuscular theory. Huyghcns 
attacked the theory and pro­
posed his wave theory. From this 
theory resulted the postulation that 
a medium in which the , waves 
could act was necessar}'. This me? 
diuni was called the - ether. The 
controversy over t-Jie- ether is al­
ready too' well known' to occasion 
comment here. Maxwell’s discov­
ery that waves set up by light 
were comparable -with those set up 
by electrical disturbances strength­
ened Huj’ghens’ theory. Zeeman’s 
discovery of the effect of a mag­
netic field upon light spectra link­
ed light with magnetism. Since 
magnetism and electrical phen- 
nomena had already been shown 
to be closely related it was but a 
step to conclude that light was 
causcd by the vibration of charged 
particles known as electrons. Stud­
ies of electrical discharges in gas-, 
eous atmospheres and the breaking 
down of radio-active atoms 
strengthened , Lorentz’s • theory. 
Einstein, proceeding along the, 
same line in developing, his gravi­
tational theory, found that by em­
ploying the conception of Min­
kowski’s four-dimensional world, 
he was able to definitely correlate 
all of the previous theories and 
view each in the terms of the oth­
er. Since matter and light had 
already been shown to have the' 
definitely proven to be subject to 
gravitational forces, why not light 
also? Since gravity acts upon that 
which has mass, light must possess 
mass. If this is true, then since 
light results from a transformation 
of energy then energy and mass 
must be related. The theories in 
regard to gravitation have already 
been arbitrarily proven in the cases 
of Mercury’s orbit and the obscrv-
VICE PRESIDENT
Mr. James S. Geyser is the vice 
president of Night Student Council 
and the president of the Night 
College of Industries. He has spent 
several years on the campus at 
night in the College of Industries, 
registering hi the Typography 
course and kindred subjects, and 
can be called a veteran.
During his many years on the 
campus lie has served the Night 
Student Council faithfully in every 
attivity which lie has engaged in. 
Among his successes are: Impor­
tant positions on the Plaid staff 
for three }rcars, news editor for 
two years, editorship of the 1929- 
30 and 1930-31- Night Student Car­
negie Handbook,' and treasurer of 
the Night Student Council for the 
year 1929-30.
ing of the bending of light due to 
the proximity of gravitational 
forces during an eclipse.
We may ask is it of any use to 
speculate upon the nature and sub­
stance of our universe? Obviously, 
anything that will shed light upon 
the mechanism of the universe will 
so influence the trend of thought 
as to bring about greater improve­
ments in all phases of life. The 
question is, are students to be­
come apprentices of the school 
of pure thought? . Students who 
study at colleges, similar to Car­
negie Tech, arc the very ones who 
should inquire carefully as to the 
merits of . such ideas. In such 
schools the tendency is too preva­
lent toward the absorption of con­
crete facts with the resultant total 
exclusion of pure thought. This 
is analogous to the case of the 
near-sighted man who, on walking 
into a cathedral, had to stand 
closely to each object in order to 
admire the quality of the excellent 
craftsmanship, but who was unable
COLLEGE SPORTS
Recent newspaper articles . have 
given considerable space to a so- 
called over-emphasis of college 
sports. Charges for and against 
have been given wide publicity anti 
sports writers have’ made most of 
the noise, thus enabling them to 
fill the sports sections during the 
lean season. However, there oc­
casionally bursts through this bar­
rage of meaningless print a sane 
opinion from men who really know 
what they are talking about. Prob­
ably tl.ie most convincing argument 
against over-emphasis was that 
given by Knute Rocknc. When lie 
was pressed for his views on the 
subject, he retorted with a mag- 
nificient “bah"—expressing in three 
letters more than could ’.>c written 
in a volume by one of the other 
contemporaries.
On the other hand, some of the 
larger colleges have made moves 
which would require some ques­
tioning in order to justify the ac­
tions. Just recently Carnegie Tech 
decided to drop spring practice. 
Closely following this decision 
came one from West Point to 
the same effect. As in all cases,
the claim is made that over em­
phasis had nothing to do with the 
decision of doing away with the 
practice. University of Pennsyl­
vania is another college to make 
a change. They* contemplate an 
entire re-organization of the exist 
ing athletic activities. The activi 
tics will be placed on the same 
basis as any other department of 
the university, and the coach will 
be given the same status as a
professor. Scouting rival schools 
for material will be p/ohibitcd. 
Special scholarships and treatment 
of the athletes will be a thing of 
the past, but inter-mural sports
are to. be encouraged and entered
into on a greater scale. This 
seems to be a move in the right 
direction and such a step should 
should call for much commenda­
tion.
That inter-collegiate sports is 
one of the big businesses of our 
country, when one considers the 
gate receipts of a sports attraction 
such as football, cannot be denied. 
YVhcthcr or not this has worked 
to a disadvantage is a question not 
easily settled, and, quoting Doc. 
Rockwcll, "If, in the discussion of 
this subject, I have added in any 
way to the confusion existing, I 
feel amply repaid for the effort 
made to enlighten you." S.
to stand back and drink in at a 
glance the rare picture of beauty 
offered' those who could see all 
of the carvings, ornaments, tinted 
glass, and lofty spires, all matched 
together to form a masterpiece of 
harmdny and color.

A WORD ON PARKING
Up until last year parking was 
permitted in a large space back 
of Machinery Hall that could ac­
commodate about 75 or 80 cars. 
The Administration stopped park­
ing in this space about a year ago 
because a few unreasonble people, 
without any thought of .their fellow 
students but with their ‘own selfish 
interests uppermost in their minds, 
drove their cars over the curb and 
lawn, cutting deep ruts in the soft 
¡ground.
The closing of this space to 
parking was justified, for the beau­
ty of our campus is of more im­
portance than a few minutes saved 
by a student who could not park 
his car in the regular and most 
approved manner. Through the ac­
tions of these few, it became'' nec­
essary for the riders of 75 other 
cars to walk as much as three or 
four blocks more to their class-, 
rooms.
You may wonder why we men­
tion this incident after a year has 
passed. The reason is this—that 
an additional ban may send more 
cars farther away -from the school 
to park if the similar practice of 
driving over the curb onto the 
grass is not stopped.
We refer to the road along the 
lower end, of Industries and which 
curves to the left where it inter­
sects with the main park road. 
Every evening we find several cars 
over the left hand curb, cutting 
ruts .in the lawn and scraping bark 
from the trees with fenders and 
bumpers. This part of the campus 
docs not come under the jurisdic­
tion of the school administration, 
but under the city government, and 
if this practidc is continued, it may 
come to a point where parking will 
be prohibited on this road entirely.
With such a large number of 
night students driving machines, 
parking space near the school is at 
a premium. We ask you then to 
be more careful how and where 
you park your car, to observe all 
parking rules and not, to abuse the 
privileges that we now enjoy.

Year Books
One of the catastrophies which appears to have affected colleges nationally, is the failure of the year book to maintain 
its position in the field of college activities. Several reasons have been advanced for the dropping off in popularity of this 
supposedly academic necessity, but nobody seems to know exactly why this change has taken place.
• Perhaps it's because colleges have outgrown their former standard of “one big happy family” and have become, instead, 
commercial, and business institutions. Perhaps it’s due to the maturing of the annual from a book pf humor, witty write-ups 
and caricatures to one of art and enlarged sports sections with ¿the consequent increase in advertising and subscription rates. Or it might be that the students’ attitudes have changed and 
they no longer relish the, thought of looking over the pictures 
of ‘'the boys” at some future date. Whatever the reason, the 'fact remains that the year-book is in a rather precarious posi­tion and something must be done soon,if it is to be" saved.
It might be dropped from its present status of costly design and art work to a mere senior book comprising short write-ups and a few features. Such a book could be edited at a very 
nominal cost and certainly should not be a financial failure. The 
very antithesis of this would be a book improved even beyond the ipresent standard' with an assured financial success caused 
by placing the subscription price on the registration fee of each student. The increase in circulation would be of advertis­
ing benefit to the colleges and would cause a, decrease in the cost of editing and, consequently, lower the selling price.
The Mid-west Student Conference convenes at Carnegie 
next week. Perhaps it would be.worth while for the delegates to discuss the problem of year-books.

cent above the average price pre­
vailing before the adoption of this 
system of relief. Since 1922, how­
ever, Dr. Ross finds that a new 
factor has entered the field. • 
Algeria,"" a French colony in 
northern Africa, which enjoys a 
lower tax rate than France, in­
creased its production 200 per cent 
in the seven years following 1922. 
In 1929, Algeria captured 27 .per
cent of the French wine market, 
with the sale of 237,330,000 gallons 
of wine in France. This flood of 
Algerian wine has swept away the 
benefits of the domestic system 
of stabilization, and has left the 
domestic grape growers . in dire 
circumstances.
This gives France a new colo­
nial problem not unlike our own 
problem of over-productiofi in 
agriculture. Total production of 
wine in France and the colonics 
exceeds consumption at remunera­
tive prices. If the weather docs 
not intervene to cause bad crops, 
the government will probably be 
called1 upon to_ make some adjust­
ment between production and con­
sumption.
From the colonial viewpoint, this 
situation is peculiar. Algeria, with 
a low tax rate,. figuratively hangs 
onto the Gallid apron strings, and 
at the same time insists upon up­
setting the French domestic wine 
market. Algeria, the rich colonial 
prize of a few decades ago, has 
turned the tables. France is now 
the prize. That is, she is Algeria’s 
prize wine market. It is 
example of what might be called 
“reverse imperialism.” Today A1 
geria may be pointed to as a pros-, 
pcrous colony,' but this gives no 
solace to the French grape grow­
ers. In fact, her prosperity sorely 
troubles the bland benevolence of 
French imperialists.
Hov/dy, You All!
“Ladcez and-d-d Gcn-tul-mcn!” 
These words from the lips of A1 
Minetti, a second Joe Humphreys, 
opened the inter-collegiate boxing 
era at Carnegie Saturday night, 
when the Tech fighters met Syra­
cuse. A goodly crowd was there— 
so goodly as to make Sir Oyerend 
smile all evening. It was perhaps 
the most concentrated crowd in the 
gym since ’way back, as all were 
packed into one end of t'lie build­
ing, ncarN.thc stage, making for a 
good view of the fights, but a poor 
scat, with someone’s knees in your 
back.
The crowd, strange to inter-col­
legiate boxing decorum, acted very 
'well until Raised to a frenzy by the 
Highbcrger-Thiel bout. Iierc the 
warning of Al Minetti against “voci­
ferous comment" during the bouts' 
was forgotten in the excitement 
raised by tl\e heavyweight clash. 
Buddy bverend’s “shushes” and Al 
Minetti’s gestures failed to quiet them. 
"Tank" Highberger,. who was opcr 
atcd on for, appendicitis just before 
Christmasearned the, decision and 
a black eye in his bout.
Among the campus fashionables 
at the boutS were the Theodore 
Rosensweigs, the Thomas Pratts, 
the Phil Magnusons, the. Koltcr 
Zieglers, the Willard Sauzcnbach 
ers", the Robert Galbrcaths and the 
Raymond Johnsons.
Except, for the absence of towel- 
swinging by the seconds and the 
lack of announcers, the-atmosphere 
was of very best approved boxing 
show styjc. .There will be one 
more boxing match at home, with 
West Virginia.
Freshman regulations were abol­
ished last week, after a weak exist­
ence during the first semester. The 
Frosh practically abolished the reg­
ulations themselves by refusing to 
obey them. This year’s freshman 
class seems to have put it /jver on 
the sophomores in every* way ex­
cept for their , class banquet. The 
Frosh haven’t held theirs yet, al­
though it is long overdue. It be­
gins to look like more of Carnegie 
traditions arc going down the line.
Among the traditions that might 
profitably be abolished is the merci­
less annual destruction caused by the 
Mathematics department. In one math 
class, composed of Seniors expecting 
to graduate this year, only two 
passed the recent final examination. 
They may be dumb, but they can’t 
be that dumb. Could it be that the 
department is especially hard-hearted? 
Tell me it isn’t true!
The annual game of “Hunt the 
Job’’ is beginning for those expect­
ing to bounce - out this June. In 
this game the big concerns send 
representatives to Carnegie with in 
structions to get sonic cheap hired 
help. The representatives make ap 
pointmcnts with the prospective 
graduates. In the interview the 
student pretends that the par­
ticular company is the only one 
he ever wanted to work for 
and the interviewer pretends that 
his company is the best lie ever 
worked for, and most probably the 
best in the country, but they prob­
ably won’t hire anyone this year, 
Then they part, and it’s all over 
until the next interview. Maybe 
the student gets an offer, and may­
be he doesn’t. If successful, lie

capacity until 1927, when he became 
Professor of General and Inorgan- 
is Chemistry at the University of 
Stockholm.
Before 1918, the scientific work 
'of Dr. Westgren dealt mainly with 
the Brownian movement. His work 
for his doctor’s degree consisted 
of a determination of the Avagadro 
number through studies of • the 
sedimentation equilibrium in gold 
celloids.
In 1919, at the Institute of Pro­
fessor. Manne Sicgbahn, Professor 
Westgren carried out an investiga­
tion on the crystal structure of 
the modifications of iron. Since 
that time lie has busied himself 
with X-ray investigations of alloys 
at the University 'of Stockholm and 
has published a number of papers 
on that subject. Most of the latter 
work has been done in collabora­
tion with Mr. G. Phragmen.
During the last five years Pro-

of the Nobel Committees for

To the Editor:
Mr. Public Nuisance, in your last 
issue, ' dwells, none too lovingly, on 
our "Pornographic Puppet” (that 
word “Pornographic” boosted the 
local sale of dictionaries ten per 
cent). And what with French and 
Latin words and phrases, of which 
we admittedly know nothing, lie has 
written a nice long article. We 
gather, on finishing his article that, 
as far as he is'concerned, all is not 
perfume in Denmark, concerning the 
Puppet.
Now, Mr. P. Nuisance, you wouldn’t 
build a brick house out of wood, 
would you? No sir,' 3'ott’d build a 
wood house. If our contributions 
arc, as you say, "Chic Sale-ish” how 
can we make a "Peter Arno-ish” 
Puppet? No sir, Mr. Nuisance, it 
can’t be done. You can get out of 
a thing only what you put in. 
(Sorry I’m not able to quote Euclid 
here, but I’m not up on him).
Mr. Nuisance, we of the Puppet 
would greatly appreciate any “Peter 
Arno-ish” contribution by you or any­
one else. Maybe you can make 
“rapid etchings of the foibles of the 
mob” for us. Wc appreciate the 
"pathology of humanity” as well as 
you; wc would wclcomc with open 
arms "Arno-ish” contributions, be 
they from king or slave. '
Aye verily, there arc humorous 
'‘belly-shaking” happenings on our 
campus. But Mr.' Nuisance, somehow 
they arc not- received as contribu­
tions so often by us. Methinks, ’tis 
easier to criticize a state of being 
than to actually rectify it. For 
every orator, there are ten critics. 
Be good to us, Mr. Nuisance, create 
rather than criticize. Hola, no 
Voila!
Is it fair, sir, to classify us, with 
our Very limited circulation and ex­
tremely limited list of contributors 
(by us I.mean all the other.“Porno- 
graphico”) to Life, Judge, and the 
New Yorker? They have an unlimt- 
ed source of contributors. As you 
know, they can reject—in fact they 
probably do reject—the greater por­
tion of material received. The Pup­
pet, sir, rejects but rarely. Usually 
wc have a hard time filling an issue.
Sir, the Puppet is ever desirous of 
expanding, so again. I bescech you, 
contribute! Be as "Peter Arno-ish” 
as you' wish—strange as it may 
seem, we appreciate it also.
So, . Mr. Nuisance, raise our wit 
from the "risus asinorum”—whatever 
that means—and deliver. Sir, it 
would give us the- greatest pleasure 
possible to put forth a Puppet that 
was at oncc clcan, subtle, and witty. 
Give us a break, start things going 
with a contribution addressed to: ' 
The Editors of ¦

Mr. Malbert B. Cary of the 
Continental Typefounders’ Associa­
tion of New York in his rcccnt 
address to incmbcrs of Carnegie’s 
printing department stated: “Ad­
vertising requires two things. At­
tract attention to the presence of 
your message and then put the 
message across.” He further illus­
trated that the pleasantness of the 
display type, and the legibility of 
the text arc the main factors of 
a good advertisement.
The supremacy of Europe, es­
pecially of Germany over America, 
in tendencies in typography and 
type design \was clearly pointed 
out. Mr. Cary corroborated his 
argument by showing the great 
amount of competition of Euro­
pean'designers. The large number 
of type foundries and type de­
signers in Europca'n competition 
brings about a condition in which 
each strives to create a better or 
newer type facc. H owever, 
due to the existence of only one 
important foundry in the United 
States there is no race for suprem­
acy.
Mr. Cary said that the tcndcncics 
in type design swing like a pen­
dulum from one extreme to the 
other. “Recently we have been 
flooded with straight line “sans- 
serif” . letters, but new faces arc 
beginning to appear with large, 
strong serifs.”
Five thousand copies of the 
pamphlet, “Printing as a Vocation,” 
by Fred J. Hartman of Washing­
ton, D. C., have been printed by 
the Department of Printing, to be 
distributed to groups bf printers in 
all'parts of the United States and 
Canada. Copies Avcrc also distrib­
uted during the annual Father and 
Son Week conducted by the United 
Typothctae of America.
The class in printing production 
is also engaged in the printing of 
two additional booklets of an edu­
cational nature which will be circu­
lated among the members of the 
typothetac.

Two weeks ago, ‘ the papers of 
the nation blared forth the Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania’s new plan 
for the exterpation of the dollar 
mark from the Winged Mercuries 
of Collcgiana. Much favorable com­
ment was voiced, many' congratu­
latory editorials were penned, the 
adjectives of non-commercialism 
and undergraduate glory ran ram­
pant. In his position as a public 
investigator, the Public Nuisance 
wishes to cast a note of warning, 
probably unheeded, but lie feels 
some sort of feeble King Canute 
should try to stem the tide of 
universal approbation.
In the first placc, with full re­
spect for President Gates’ . inten­
tions—lie-being the Penn .leader 
who proposed the drastic change— 
tjicre are certain undertones about, 
the Philadelphia campus which 
make him recall that' tlic road to 
hell is rather well paved, not with 
concrctc, but with those very same 
good intentions. The undertone 
which the P. N. refers to is a sor­
did hint of—dare we call it com­
mercialism—which exists in ' the 
City of Fraternal Amour.
Any industry which *culls some 
$400,000 from rabid Cornell and 
Penn football fans every Thanks­
giving, is not to be lightly shunt­
ed by any presidential gesture, no 
matter how generous or princely. 
Those gentlemen of the alumni, 
who arc firmly infected with the 
virus of forgotten ‘school spirit, or 
perhaps it is. the virus which gives 
them a good excuse to leave their 
offices for a gala week-end, arc 
not going to have their alma 
maters stripped of November 
glory. Too many alumni have 
contributed foi*' football scholar­
ships to permit one solitary official 
—a- maneuver so mighty. A sport

cannot be dissipated by the wave

So, the Public Nuisance is some­
what doubtful of the succcss of 
President Gates’ splendid gesture. 
It reminds him somewhat of the 
gesture which the six hundred who 
rode into the • Valley of Death ex­
hibited..
Nor does the Public Nuisance 
bcMieve that there is anything so 
terribly splendid in actuality with 
the gesture. Nor can the Public 
Nuisance sec anything particularly 
obnoxious about the commercial 
features of college athletics. Why 
shouldn’t they be commercial; why 
shouldn’t a poverty stricken school 
have some legitimate mqdc of in­
creasing its i\csourccs? What is so 
frightfully sordid about paying 
bcmusclcd but unbebraincd' gentle­
men to push each other in the 
mud, ten Saturdays during the 
Fall, at grave risk to their cervical 
vertebrae and semilunar cartilages?
Did the mob who howls aboi|t 
the lewd commercialism have to 
undergo the sweating grind of the 
training period, I wonder how non­
commercial they would feel? A 
man works, a man advertizes his 
school, why shouldn’t he get paid? 
It s not so funny to bear a game 
leg through life for the fleeting 
glory of alma mater, wlios.e alumni 
force you into the pit of everlast­
ing darkness for ever and ever, 
with the dreadful stigma: "He 
dropped the punt in the Pitt-Tech 
game.”
The Public Nuisance prophecies, 
therefore, that náuglit practically 
will come of the Gates’ plan; that 
it may be taken up for a year or 
two, but will discreetly be dropped. 
That commercialism will continue 
to hold its well earned and well 
deserved place in intercollegiate 
athletió^. That undergraduate 
apathy to personal exercise will ,in 
no measure change in the Five 
Year Plan to come.
