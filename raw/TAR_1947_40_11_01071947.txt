SAM Presents Public Forum 
On Labor-Management Issues
“Labor and Management” was 
the subject of a forum on in­
dustrial management sponsored 
by S. A. M. on January 6 at 8:00 
in the lecture hall of Carnegie 
Institute. Moderator William Wit­
te, vice-president in charge of 
manufacturing of James H. Mat­
thews Co., presided over the pro­
gram which was presented in a 
“Town Hall of the Air” manner,
Mr. R. E. Jones, assistant to the 
General Manager of Blaw Knox 
Division of Blaw Knox Corpora­
tion, presented Management’s 
viewpoint and Joseph Scanlon, na­
tional director of research for the 
C.I.O., upheld Labor’s argument. 
The speakers gave their rebuttals 
and then discussed questions from 
the floor. Mr. Witte closed the 
meeting with a summary of the 
forum.
The forum was arranged to
A VC Sets Date 
To End Contest 
To Reduce Lines
The deadline of the suggestion 
contest for eliminating congestion 
at the bookstore at the beginning 
of each semester has been set for 
January 10. The entry box is lo­
cated just outside the bookstore 
and will remain there till the con­
test deadline.
Petitions for increased veterans’ 
subsistence and disability pensions 
are still being circulated by the 
AVC All-College Chapter. The 
petitions can be found on most of 
the bulletin boards throughout the 
school.
On Thursday, January 9, there 
will be a veterans’ housing rally 
in the County Courthouse build­
ing, sponsored by the AVC area 
council of Pittsburgh. Mayor 
David L. Lawrence and Father 
Owen Rice, former OPA rent di­
rector, will be the principal speak­
ers, and it is hoped that Wilson 
Wyatt, former veterans’ housing 
expediter, will be the guest 
speaker.
enable students to obtain contem­
porary views of men in manage­
ment and in labor movements, to 
promote an understanding of labor 
and management viewpoints con­
cerning industrial management 
and to examine some of the com­
mon cliches in the light of an en­
gineering approach to social prob­
lems.
It is well to know that labor 
often feels management is not do­
ing its best in its job, and that 
management often feels labor has 
unfairly opposed technological im­
provements in production methods 
and methods of supervision.
Lack of Interest 
Forces Honorary 
To Cancel Trips
The proposed plans 'o trans­
port Carnegie Tech students to 
out - of - town basketball games 
have been cancelled, due to a lack 
of interest in the plan, it was an­
nounced today by Alpha Phi 
Omega, sponsoring organization.
A survey of the student body 
by means of a special coupon in 
the last issue of the Tartan re­
vealed that there were so few 
members of the student body in­
terested in making the trip that 
it would be impracticable to char­
ter special busses as had been 
planned.
Several reasons have been sug­
gested as to the cause of the lack 
of interest. The cost of each trip 
was high, being close to four dol­
lars. The balloting was done dur­
ing the. week before Christmas va­
cation, so many students did not 
have a chance to register their 
desire to attend. The dates set 
were necessarily in the distant fu­
ture, February and March 8, re­
spectively and many people were 
not able to plan so far ahead.
If there are any students inter­
ested in attending either of these 
games, they are requested to 
contact Dean J. A. Dickinson.
Bridge Tournament
Attention, bridge players! 
Watch the bulletin boards this 
week for details of the elimi­
nation tournament to be held 
in order to determine C.I.T.’s 
entrants in the Intercollegiate 
Bridge Tournament. Full de­
tails as to the time and place 
of the tournament and quali­
fications for entrance will ap­
pear on the bulletin board no­
tices.
Student Council 
Postpones Voting 
Until January 21
, Student Council elections have 
been postponed until January 21, 
1947, according to a decision made 
at the last Council mefeting. The 
elections were formerly scheduled 
for January 14.
All nominees who have not yet 
done so are requested to submit to 
the Tartan a list of their activities 
and the three principal points of 
their platform, each stated in one 
sentence, as well as their, picture, 
before 7:30 p. m., Friday, Janu­
ary 10.
Election Results Decide 
Exchange Of Vacation
Suspension of classes for a day and a half during Spring Car­
nival may be obtained if the students approve a proposal of the 
Spring Carnival committee at a special election to be held in 
the near future.
Cloyd Mellott, general chairman of the committee, has an­
nounced that the Executive Board approved substituting a va­
cation on Friday and Saturday of
Spring Carnival week for the 
first day of Easter vacation, 
Thursday, April 3. This substitu­
tion must be approved by a ma­
jority vote of the students.
The date of the special election 
will be announced in next week’s 
Tartan. All undergraduate stu­
dents in the three colleges are 
eligible to vote.
If classes are held on the Fri­
day and Saturday of Spring Car­
nival, the scope of the Carnival 
will be greatly curtailed, said 
Mellott. Tentatively, a full pro­
gram has been scheduled, starting 
Thursday evening, and running 
to the dance on Saturday evening. 
If the students do* not approve the 
exchange of the days of classes, 
the Carnival program will be 
severely restricted.
MMCC Director, Dr. Watkins 
Announces Future Resignation
Dr. Charles Watkins
Campus Leaders Discuss Problems
Dismissal of classes during 
Spring Carnival, extending the 
Saturday night closing hour, and 
lowering prices at Skibo were the 
main issues of discussion at a din­
ner meeting of the Student Con­
ference committee on December 
18. Other problems considered at 
this time included absenteeism be­
fore and after > holidays, salaries 
for publication staffs, and women’s 
dorm regulations.
Vacation for Spring Carnival
Dr. B. E. Warden, dean of men, 
opened the round table discussion 
with the question concerning the 
exchange of one day of Easter va­
cation for the Friday and Satur­
day before Carnival.
His main points of contention 
were the likelihood of excessive 
absences on the Thursday before 
Easter and the possibility of only 
a very slight majority favoring the 
exchange. While discussing the 
problem of post-holiday absences, 
Dr. Doherty suggested some form 
of penalty be imposed on those 
missing class. The representatives 
felt, however, that class attendance 
was the student’s personal obli­
gation and that, if a student was 
willing to miss the work, it was 
his own concern.
A special election will be held 
at some future date to determine 
what vacation day the students
wish to give up. In reviewing the 
possibilities of a near 50-50 vote 
on the exchange of days, the com­
mittee, while predicting a large 
majority vote in favor of the 
change, agreed to leave the final 
decision to a simple majority vote 
rather than a two-thirds basis. 
Skibo Prices
The following discussion in­
volved prices at Skibo. Dr. Doh­
erty revealed a crucial problem 
now facing the cafeteria. Ac­
cording to the original plan, stu­
dents were to clear their own ta­
bles and carry out their own 
dishes. Since they have failed to 
do this, additional help must be 
hired to perform their job. To 
pay this additional help, food 
prices will have to be raised.
The committee was heartily op­
posed to higher prices and sug­
gested a publicity campaign to 
make students aware of this situ­
ation.
The next question was directed 
to Dr. Doherty. Speaking for the 
student body, the committee want­
ed to know whether campus res­
taurants were abiding by their 
original resolution to operate on 
a non-profit basis.
Dr. Doherty’s answer to “Is 
Skibo making profits?” was a defi­
nite “No.” He concluded his 
statement with a summary of the
CIT policy of buying quality food 
and serving decent portions in 
preference to buying poor food 
and serving infinitesimal portions 
in order to lower the prices.
Dean Warden backed up Dr. 
Doherty’s statement with some 
approximate statistics. Com­
pared to the national increase in 
food prices of about 30%, Carne­
gie Tech’s increase has been only 
18%.
It was also stated that the fees 
the men and women dorm students 
paid for meals covered their own 
food costs and were not inter­
changed.
Publication Salaries
The meeting was concluded with 
a short review of the salary-for- 
editorial-positions proposition. Ac­
cording to Dr. Doherty the issue 
was closed last year. The school 
felt that it was not a worthwhile 
expenditure, since publications are 
extra-curricular activities, and 
that, in cases of need, grants of aid 
were available and sufficient.
The Student Conference com­
mittee is composed of the leaders 
of important campus activities, 
meeting once a month with Dr. 
Doherty and other administration 
representatives. At these meet­
ings student and administrative 
problems are aired and suggestions 
for solution are offered.
Dr. Charles Watkins, director of 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col­
lege, is leaving Carnegie Tech at 
the end of the spring semester. He 
has accepted the position of pro­
fessor of Chemistry at Lincoln 
Memorial College.
Dr. Watkins came to Pittsburgh 
in 1915 after teaching in his Alma 
Mater, Washington and Lee, in 
Virginia. He has taught Chemis­
try at C. I. T. since that time and 
has been director of M. M. C. C. 
for the past fourteen years.
Last summer Dr. Watkins trav­
eled to Morristown, Tenn., his na­
tive state, and while there he vis­
ited the Lincoln Memorial Col­
lege, a liberal arts school found­
ed in 1890. He remarked to Pres­
ident Stewart W. McClelland that 
the college “looked pretty good” 
to him. It seems that Dr. Watkins 
looked good to President McClel­
land too, for a teaching offer came 
soon after. Dr. Watkins accepted 
the offer because of a desire to 
return to the South and to less 
strenuous activity in a smaller 
college.
Miss Winchester, professor and 
head of the department of Secre­
tarial Studies in M. M. C. C., will 
become assistant director of the 
college on February 1.
Faculty Members 
To Judge Essays
Faculty members of the Eng­
lish and Electrical departments 
will select the three entries from
C. I. T. for the technical writing 
contest sponsored by the Pitts­
burgh Chapter of the American 
Institute of Electrical Engineers.
In order to be eligible lor the 
competition, papers must be sub­
mitted to the electrical depart­
ment not later than February 17, 
1947. Entries will also include se­
lections from the University of 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania State 
College, and the University of 
West Virginia.
The four winning papers in this 
competition will be read by their 
authors at a special meeting of the 
local section of AIEE, and the 
final winners, to be awarded cash 
prizes totaling $75, will be chosen 
from these.
ROTC Revives 
Fraternity
Scabbard and Blade, honorary 
fraternity of the ROTC, is being 
re-activated after three years. 
Interviews for advanced ROTC 
students eligible for membership 
were held Sunday in the Carnegie 
Union. Approximately 20 men 
will be pledged.
At present there are 15 mem­
bers on the campus. The active 
organization is now functioning 
with Joseph R. Blenko as Captain, 
James O. Nichol as 2nd Lieuten­
ant, and Crayton Wood as 1st 
Sergeant.
Scabbard and Blade formerly 
sponsored an annual Military Ball, 
ordinarily one of the biggest all­
school dances of the year. The 
Ball featured the tapping of 
pledges and the presentation of an 
award to the Honorary Drill 
Cadet. Both the Ball and the 
Drill Cadet award will be revived 
as soon as possible.
Tecvets Interview 
Mayor Lawrence
The Tecvets inaugurated their 
new policy of presenting men in 
the news to the veterans of the 
Carnegie Tech campus with the 
appearance of Mayor David L. 
Lawrence as their first guest on 
December 19, 1946.
The first question was aimed at 
discovering Mayor Lawrence’s 
background. The Mayor explain­
ed .that he began work in a law 
office at the age of fourteen and 
that this was the beginning of his 
interest in politics.

Clara Herron—the only girl on 
campus who freely admits that she 
talks too much; the only woman 
on campus who freely and frankly 
admits that losing six umbrellas 
in a year delineates something 
significant about her character 
. . . She has been characterized 
facetiously as an effervescent ex-
Clara Herron
treme extrovert (probably because 
the words are so nicely alliter­
ative).
Actually, she is a Margaret 
Morrison senior who takes a kind 
and helpful interest in people. 
She is very capable (despite the 
umbrella story and the loss of 
other valuable objects) since she 
had risen to the editorship of the 
Tartan in her junior year from 
the lowly position of sub-cub re-

porter in her freshman year.
But that is not all of her suc­
cess story. She is on Mortar 
Board, is the president of Pi Delta 
Epsilon, the president and past 
secretary of the International Re­
lations club, the vice-president of 
Women’s Guild, vice-president of 
the junior class, a member of the 
Student Conference committee, 
associate editor of the Handbook 
staff, and last but not least, a 
member of Phi Kappa Phi, the 
highest honorary on the Tech 
campus, to which only the brainy 
and original may aspire.
Her very complete list of ac­
tivities shows Clara’s well-round­
ed personality.
She does very well in her 
schoolwork—her department is 
general studies, English major. 
But She was not always an Eng­
lish major.
The house ec. department left 
her with a distinct distaste for 
housework. Among things she 
does like, however, are good short 
stories (not the type popular in 
magazines now), music, animals, 
(she used to own two Scotties and 
would like to have a collie and a 
cairn terrier, and a horse), read­
ing, riding, swimming, and bad­
minton.
She only smokes "because people 
keep handing her cigarettes. This 
past summer she took a course in 
Journalism at Pitt. Strangely 
enough the ex-editor of the Tar­
tan got C’s on her first stories. 
But after a few stories the prof 
saw the light and she got her 
usual “A” out of the course.

Special meeting 
December 18, 1946 
Because a quorum was not pres­
ent, this meeting can not be 
termed a regular Student Council 
meeting, but must be called a 
Special Meeting. Therefore, all 
motions passed during this meet­
ing must be approved by the 
Council at the next regular meet­
ing.
The meeting was called to or­
der at 4:45 p. m.
Those present were: Misses
Lisle, Ollett, and Price; Messrs. 
Christenson, Engle, Farrahy, Gar­
ner, Nutter, and Yorkin. 
COMMITTEE REPORTS 
Publicationse Committee:
Mr. Engle reported that a peti­
tion concerning the recommenda­
tion for paying the advertising 
staffs of the publications has been 
submitted to the administration. 
However, no action has been 
taken.
Election Committee:
Mr. Farrahy moved that the 
date for Student Council elections 
be changed from January 14, 1947, 
to January 21, 1947.
Motion carried. '
Points and Keys Committee:
Miss Lisle moved that the fol­
lowing keys be awarded to Sci­
mitars.
Tony Arrott 
Fred Frank 
Vince Benya 
Bob Ayres 
Les Engle 
Motion carried.
OLD BUSINESS:
Mr. Gamer turned over the In­
ter-College Bridge Tournament to 
Mr. Farrahy and Delta Skull.
Mr. William Demorest presented 
the petition from the American 
Veterans Committee (All-College 
Chapter) for approval. Mr. Yorkin 
moved that this petition be ap­
proved.
Motion carried.
Mr. James Nichol, representing
istic work after she graduates. 
She may go to Syracuse university 
for her Master’s in journalism.
Things she dislikes are house­
keeping, sewing, cooking, days 
with six hours of classes, affected 
people, beer, (though she likes 
strong likker), and “To Each His 
Own.”
Her ideal man has a sense of 
humor; he dances well; plays 
bridge better than Clara; and is 
kind. Looks are not too impor­
tant though she wants children 
who look human and she thinks 
that there is something in hered­
ity. Any eligible men who fit the 
qualifications can advance and be 
recognized, but five years of ca­
reer come first
New Dean Man
Dr. James A. Dickinson, the new 
Asst. Dean of Men at* CIT in the 
Division of Student Welfare, has 
found very little difficulty in ad­
justing himself to campus life, but 
his small office, which is located 
in Industries Hall, is hardly ade­
quate for the numerous activities 
which are now handled by him. 
During the fall term, his main 
problem was obtaining off campus 
housing facilities for students. 
Part time employment, financial 
aid, and scholarships are a few of 
the many other phases of Student 
Welfare. All extra-curricular ac­
tivities pass through his Office 
among which are Student Council, 
Publications, and Student Organi­
zations.
Almost anything which has to 
do with the students is bound to 
receive the attention of Dr. Dick­
inson. One student couldn’t find 
a tie with the Tech Plaid. But it 
wasn’t surprising that when he in­
quired at Student Welfare, he 
found that they knew all the an­
swers.
Dean Dickinson is a graduate 
of Dartmouth College. While an 
undergraduate, he played on the 
Dartmouth Varsity Basketball 
Team and was elected a member 
of the Senior Student Council. He 
received an M. A. at Harvard and
Council
Scabbard and Blade, requested the 
permission of Student Council to 
re-activate that organization. Mr. 
Engle moved that we approve this 
request.
Motion carried.
NEW BUSINESS:
Mr. Nichol then asked for a date 
on the social calendar in order to 
hold the Military Ball. Discus­
sion of this dance was tabled un­
til it is ascertained whether or not 
the Tecvets are planning to hold 
their dance on March 29.
Mr. Arenitesky requested perr 
mission from Student Council to 
sell sandwiches in the dorms at 
night. Mr. Yorkin moved that we 
recommend to Dean Dickinson 
that Mr. Arenitesky be permitted 
to carry out his plans.
Motion carried.
The meeting adjourned at 5:10 
p. m.
Respectfully submitted,
Jean Marie Price,
Secretary.
Dr. Max Schoen, nationally 
prominent educator and head of 
the Department of Psychology 
and education at C.I.T., has writ­
ten three books which are to be 
published in the spring.
In collaboration with Dr. 
Schrieckel and Dr. Van Meter 
Ames, professor of philosophy at 
the University
o f Cincinnati, 
Dr. Schoen has 
written Under­
standing the 
World. This 
book is intend­
ed for use as a 
textbook on 
the history of 
the story of the 
development of 
thought about 
nature, society, 
and art from 
the time of the ancient Greeks to 
the present time. It will be pub­
lished by Harper’s.
The second book is a series of 
essays, edited by Dr. Schoen and 
Dorothy M. Schulliam, a member 
of the Army Medical Library. 
These essays by various authors 
are about the history of musical 
thetapy. They tell about the asso­
ciations of music and medicine 
from primitive times to the pres­
ent Henry Schuman, a publishing 
firm specializing in rare medical 
books, will publish this book.
The third book, The Imaginary, 
written by Jean* Paul Satre, a 
prominent contemporary French
of Many Duties
received his Ph.D. from Ohio 
State University.
During the war he served in 
the U. S. Naval Reserve as a gun-
Dr. James A. Dickinson
nery officer on the destroyer es­
cort U. S. S. Yokes. He then be­
came Officer-in-Charge of Per­
sonnel and Statistics of the entire 
Naval Education program, and 
served in this capacity until re­
porting to his present position as 
Asst. Dean of Men at CIT. His 
experience in the education pro­
gram helped him become accus­
tomed to civilian life. When ask­
ed about his service, he said it 
could all be neatly summed up in 
the recent political campaign slo­
gan, “I have had enough.”

Editor’s Armchair
Skibo Prices
Everybody, particularly the student veteran, is trying to 
save money these days. With inflated prices soaring higher and 
higher, this is no easy task, so when Carnegie Tech announces 
that the students themselves can keep down food prices, it is 
time to pay heed.
The students can help keep Skibo prices down or can force 
them to be increased.
When Skibo was reopened last year, a carry-out-your-own- 
dishes policy was adopted. Until recently, this plan had proved 
sufficiently successful. However, as more and more students 
carry out less and less dishes, it begins to look as if the serve- 
yourself policy has failed.
As a result the school will be forced to hire extra help for 
the job of removing dirty dishes. When extra help is hired, more 
money must go out in wages. Since campus restaurants operate 
on a close price-balance-expenses basis, an increase in expenses 
means an increase in price. To pay a man to carry out dishes, 
the cost for a ham sandwich or a sauerkraut dinner must go 
up a few cents.
To the student who is trying to save money, a nickel or a 
dime more for every meal soon adds up. Yet these nickels and 
dimes can be saved very easily.
If every one who eats at the beanery could endure the phy­
sical exertion of lifting a few dishes on a tray and carrying that 
tray to the disposal window, extra help would not be needed and 
prices could stay where they are.
Perhaps this is asking too much of the student. If so, he can 
continue to clutter up the tables and pay for that luxury and 
so will every one else.
It’s an amazing offer.
The students can keep Skibo prices down or they can force 
them to be increased.

BETSY ROSS
TEA ROOM
The perfect place for meals away from school
Good Food—Low Prices—Conveniently Near 
FORBES STREET, OAKLAND
By Andy Cantini
Having duly celebrated the holidays a la Ray Milland, I now 
find myself infested. with the usual run of pink elephants and snakes. 
Speaking of snakes—the illustrious Governor Neely, or Tracy, or what­
ever his name is, will probably hate me for that remark—in my so­
journ in the beautiful hills of West Virginia (How’s that, Governor!) 
I came across the following scoop.
ATTENTION ALL SPORTS EDITORS—PLEASE COPY: In a 
personal interview with Carl Ha- 
mill, coach at Weirton High 
School, Weirton, West Virginia, it 
was revealed that Bill Kern, Tech 
grid mentor of the late 30’s, is 
definitely out as football coach at 
West Virginia University. The 
present squabble is whether the 
director of athletics, Legs Hawley, 
should be returned. Carl Hamill 
has been approached to move in­
to the Mountaineer post a la Paul 
Brown style. However, Hamill 
says that he will not accept unless 
there is a complete change in the 
school policy. In other words, Legs 
Hawley must go. This reporter is 
inclined to believe that such an 
action will take place. Hamill is 
not only a worthy successor but 
has the backing of a very influen­
tial group from the northern pan­
handle—the Weirton Steel Com­
pany.
PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS:
The cagers are in for another tough 
week. Tomorrow they face Pitt 
(it’s a college!) and Saturday W. 
and J. pays its annual visit. Pitt 
has won but one game against 
four defeats, while W. and J. is 
again sporting another crack out­
fit. The Presidents are crowding 
W.V.U. and Duquesne for district 
honors. Both games will be play­
ed on the Tech floor; so let’s all 
attend and get behind the team ...
This corner hopes that the boys 
will have found their shooting eye 
for these games. Last month I 
traveled to Beaver Falls to take in 
the Tech-Geneva tussle. Our boys 
played a superb floor game. The 
tricky offense and ball-handling 
had the Covies baffled. However 
the game doesn’t pay off on those 
counts. Time and again easy shots 
failed to find their mark. During 
the first quarter Tech took twenty- 
four shots and made four. In the 
second, none were made of nine­
teen. The last two games against 
Waynesburg and Buffalo have 
followed about the same pattern.
. . . The Kilroy A.C. intramural 
entry is hoping that the new year 
will spell doom to the T.X. jinx.
During the touch football season 
these two undefeated teams bat­
tled and the Kilroys were shel­
lacked. Last month these two 
teams met again to decide the 
volleyball championship. The Kil­
roys were heavy pre-game favor­
ites, but again T.X. emerged vic­
torious in a very close and ex­
citing match.
Cantini for Council
The student council elections 
will take place in two weeks.
Yours truly has entered his name 
on the ballot. Not being a poli­
tician, I can’t offer any drummed- 
up platform. However, I believe 
that something should be done 
about our athletics. If the key to 
its improvement is the student 
council, I’m your man.
Intramural
Roundup
Since all thè writers start the 
new year with the final results 
of the last, Ihis will be a good 
time to mention some of the high­
lights. Everyone knows about the 
football results of the past year, 
but since the holidays, finals have 
been played in table tennis, hand­
ball, and volleyball.
In table tennis, Joe Duroux and 
Dick Alexander beat Gordon 
Holmes and Jim Taylor in five 
games 19-21, 23-21, 22-20, 19-21, 
21-18 to take the doubles cham­
pionship. This week Duroux will 
play Holmes for the singles 
crown.
T. X. Volleyball Champs
In a thrilling two-hour playoff, 
T. X. stopped Kilroy in the fifth 
game to win a well-deserved 
championship. The T.X.’s beat the 
A.T.O.’s in three games, but in 
the closely contested match with 
the Kilroy A.C. they were extend­
ed all the way. Kilroy won the 
second pair of games 21-9, 21- 
16, after losing the first two 19- 
21, 15-21, but could not last all 
the way as they dropped the final 
10-21.
v The handball finals in the dou­
bles proved an easy task for Per- 
hacs and Ivan, as they turned 
back Gibbons and Ambrose in two 
games 21-11, 21-9.
Foul-Shooting Contest
Tomorrow in the gym at-four- 
thirty, the preliminary rounds of 
the foul-shooting contest will get 
underway. The winner must be 
one of seven who survive this ini­
tial round, and his total score will 
be the results of the first and 
second rounds. The five highest 
teams in the preliminary will 
continue to shoot in the finals that 
will be held Wednesday, January 
15, at four-thirty.
Last year’s winner was Norm 
Larsen with 84 baskets out of 100. 
Frank Becker was runner-up 
with 79.

Fresh from pre-holiday defeat 
at home and abroad, the victor f 
starved Carnegia Tartans wil. 
face ah up-and-coming Universi­
ty of Pittsburgh quintet on tht 
local gym tomorrow night at 8:30
The Tartan five dropped its 
fourth straight last Saturday at 
Buffalo when the Bisons broke 
loose in the final period to pil^ 
up an impressive 45-31 victory.- 
Previous losses were at the hands 
of West Virginia 76-37, Geneva 
51-36, and Waynesburg 51-33. 
Tartans Underdogs
Coach Donohoe’s boys will take 
to the floor underdogs, but a re­
versal of the breaks which have 
been consistently against the lo­
cals might make the story read 
differently.
Pitt’s record is little better thar 
Carnegie’s. The Panthers also lost 
their first four games, but finally 
found themselves last Saturday 
when they opened their home 
season by tripping Penn State 42- 
31. Dodo Canterna and Nate Ap­
ple have been carrying the ball 
all season—Apple ringing the bell 
for 18 points against State. 
Katselas High Scorer
Tasso Katselas has been chief 
basketmaker since the Geneva 
game with a total of 44 points for 
the season. Katselas’s shots have 
been mainly on the spectacular 
side, thrown from any angle, and 
with any degree of accuracy.
Coach Donohoe’s zone defense 
has been increasingly effective. 
After yielding 19 field goals in the 
Geneva and Waynesburg games, 
it harnessed the Bison attack until 
Lou Corriere took an extra shot 
of adrenalin and broke the Uni­
versity of Buffalo individual scor­
ing record with 26 points. y
Saturday the Tartans will play 
host to the Presidents from Wash­
ington and Jefferson. The invaders 
are undefeated and are classed as 
one of the powers in the Tri-State 
area, along with West Virginia and 
the red-hot Dukes who have a 
string of nine victories to brag 
about.

gardner, Ehni, DeMaria, McGraw, 
McMurray, Shack, and Zellner.

in advance and that definite as­
signments be given for the execu­
tion of these plans. Miss Zellner 
suggested that a local name band 
be contacted to see if one could 
be obtained for a fee within the 
price range of that appropriated 
by Council for such expenditure. 
Mr. Martello stated that the use 
of the school P. A. system might 
prove more satisfactory than those 
owned by the orchestras. Miss 
Ashcraft proposed that some 
means, such as a novelty dance, 
be used to get the crowd to mix 
and become acquainted.
Mr. Mihelich called upon Mr. 
Biscup to explain the duties and 
representation on Council to those 
who had been invited to become 
.Council members and were at­
tending their fifst Council meet­
ing. Mr. Biscup traced the his­
tory of the new plan of represen­
tation and explained briefly the 
necessity for the modernization 
of the constitution during the war 
years. He suggested the new mem­
bers refer to the handbook for 
further details regarding the eve­
ning student organization.
Mr. Biscup suggested that since 
there has been a prolongation in 
the delivery of the handbooks, 
these books, when they are re­
ceived, be withheld until the sec­
ond semester and’ distributed at 
that time.
Mr. Biscup reported that the 
insignia keys had arrived and that 
there had been several discrep­
ancies made in the jeweling of 
the keys. Some of the third year 
awards into which a ruby should 
be set contained no jewels and 
some of the second year awards, 
which should be unjeweled, con­
tained a ruby. Miss McGraw mov­
ed that in view of the previous 
extension of the date of the in­
signia banquet due to the delayed 
delivery of the keys, the mistake 
on the part of the national jew­
eler be overlooked as far as the 
keys that were jeweled by mis-

Clem greeting you all again 
with best wishes for a Happy 
New Year. It seems that the Eng­
lish Composition class is required 
to express their views once a 
week, this week it is—“What to 
do with an unexpected gift of 
$157.11.” Never look a gift horse 
in the mouth is my motto . . . 
With the start of the New Year, 
I find that, next to debt, the hard­
est thing to get out of is a warm 
bed on a cold morning ... I
may as well wish you all a Merry 
Christmas again—Greek Orthodox 
Xmas next week you know.
Well, the space in this little 
room of ours is at a premium 
again; Elsie Capelli has recruited 
three lovely girls to help us in 
our work, their names — Edith 
Collins, Nan Shgrtley, Elizabeth 
Lang . . . Cecille Zellner is not 
with us tonight, could be the exces­
sive New Year’s Eve celebration, 
or should we believe Ann Shack 
and let it go with a bad cold . . . 
These dark winter nights remind 
me of life being a long dark road 
unless a fellow gets lit once in a 
while . . .
There has Deen many a man 
that has come and gone from the 
campus of C. I. T., but of these 
there are many who could govern 
multitudes if they could govern 
their tongues . . . Some good ad­
vice for J. Miscimarra: It is get­
ting close to final exams, forget 
that girl from U. of Michigan.
Tom said he will try to bring 
sixteen fellows to the next dance. 
When he asked Rose-Mary to sup­
ply dates for the entire (16), she 
said, “Never mind! I’ll take care 
of all of them” . . . Ann won’t 
let me write any more so I must 
stop now . . .
take were concerned, and that the 
persons receiving the jeweled 
keys this year be given their sec­
ond year award as non-jeweled 
keys next year. The third year 
awards which have not been jew­
eled will, of course, have to be 
sent back to the jeweler for jew­
eling. The motion was seconded 
by Miss McMurray and approved 
by Council.
There was a discussion as to 
what date should be set for the 
Insignia Banquet, and it was de­
cided to hold the banquet on Jan­
uary 4th. Mr. Mihelich is to con­
tact the hotels to see what ar­
rangements could be made for this 
date. The guests to be invited to 
the banquet are Mrs. Hays, Dr. 
Warden, Mrs. Yon, Mr. Cleeton, 
Major Stanton, Mr. McKelway, 
Dr. Jones, Mr. Elliott, Dr. Doherty, 
and Dean Dickinson. Mr. Biscup 
is working on the design for the 
program for the banquet.
Mr. Mihelich reported that some 
of the students wished to have an­
other social function before the 
next scheduled dance, which is to 
occur in February. After much 
discussion regarding the difficul­
ties involved in securing space for 
such an affair, it was decided that 
Miss Shack should try to obtain 
Thistle hall for a Saturday even­
ing during January and if this is 
possible, a dance or a party should 
be planned for the date on which 
the hall can be secured.
The meeting was adjourned at 
4:45 p. m.
