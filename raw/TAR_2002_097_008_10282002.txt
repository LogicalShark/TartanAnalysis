Union says Parkhurst 
silences its employees
Jeff Cullers/Photo Editor
The main corridor in the basement directly under Kirr Commons will soon house an expanded Career Center. Dean of Student Affairs Michael Murphy has arranged 
funding for a concurrent endeavor that would add a recreation center, with pool tables, ping pong tables, arid video games. Its location is to be determined.University plans to utilize UC basement

While no plans exist to bring Dave and Busters 
to the University Center, a proposed recreational 
space in the building will have some similarity to 
the restaurant, says Student Body president Brian 
Namey.
Without alcohol of course, the 3,800 square 
foot space will include many of the commercial 
outfit’s accoutrements, including video games, 
pool tables, all in close proximity to dining ven­
dors.
A second floor recreational space would be a 
major coup for UC food vendors and Parkhurst,
the Eat ’n Park subsidiary, which oversees the 
much maligned dining program, but concerns 
from the athletics department and student organi­
zations may alter the plan’s initial layout.
Plans include constructing a 6,000 square foot 
Career Center beneath Kirr Commons. 
Additionally, the University would build a 6,000 
square foot dance and fitness center in the base­
ment to replace the current second floor rooms. 
The space currently housing the University Center 
fitness facilities will be used to create the recre­
ational complex.
For now, all proposals for the use of the base­
ment are tentative. Murphy believes a plan will be 
complete before Thanksgiving. He expects a town 
meeting to occur in early to mid-November and
Namey has put together a committee that will 
generate ideas and recommendations for the pro­
ject. The University has also begun to consult with 
architects and research the possibilities in relation 
to fire/safety and mechanical issues.
Other features of the rec space would include 
ping-pong tables, couches, and tables, but it’s the 
video games that Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy says will make the place tick.
The machines are expected to pay back an inter­
nal loan, based on a projected annual revenue of 
$70,000 over 20 years, that will fund the recre­
ational and fitness space development.

Starting today, Dining Services 
workers will only be provided one 
meal a day, regardless of how many 
hours they have worked that day. 
Management may still eat as many 
meals as they want. It is the most 
recent decree made by Parkhurst 
management, who took over CMU 
dining in 2000, that has upset the 
workers.
“We figure if it goes for employees, 
it should go for management,” said 
an Dining Services worker, who 
wished to remain anonymous.
Parkhurst managers declined to 
comment on the new policy.
Despite their frustrations, few 
workers will speak up against 
Parkhurst.
“No one wants to fuck around with 
them — they’re evil,” said another 
worker, who worried that identifying 
himself would jeopardize his job.
Many employees are also upset 
about the way they are treated by 
Parkhurst’s managers on an individ­
ual basis. Jane Fahringer, the recent­
ly promoted district manager of 
Parkhurst, ‘ was mentioned several 
times.
“Jane Fahringer? She’s a big bitch, 
is what it comes down to. Everybody 
hates her,” said Zack Deighan, a 
worker at Dining Services who has 
recently put in his two-week notice.
Deighan, a driver for CMU’s cater­
ing service, has never been fined or 
censured by Parkhurst or Fahringer, 
but he knows several people who 
have.
He said that Fahringer recently 
tried to force two of her workers to 
move her desk for her, which is not in 
their job description. When they 
complained, according to Deighan, 
she insisted.
“She told them that they would do 
it, and do it with a smile on their 
faces — that if they weren’t happy
about it, they could go home,” said« 
Deighan.
He said that the workers did agree;; 
to move the desk but that one of theni 
remained unhappy about it- 
Fahringer then sent him home for the! 
rest of the day.
Fahringer declined comment oh 
Deighan’s accusation.
Deighan mentioned several other 
cases of Fahringer’s abusing power, 
even towards other managers. 
According to Deighan, Parkhurst 
manager Brian Rostek resigned after 
Fahringer insisted that he push her in, 
her wheelchair after she had injured 
her leg.
Rostek, who left at the end of 
September, declined comment on the 
incident, saying that he was unwill­
ing to be involved in any “bashing.”
“The workers are absolutely won­
derful and the managers who worked 
for me were a good group of guys. 
Jane Fahringer was my boss, but 
everyone else was terrific,” said 
Rostek.
Hermaine Delaney, a union repre­
sentative for Local 585, the union 
which represents CMU’s dining work­
ers, also said that Fahringer, as well 
as other Parkhurst managers, mis­
treat and verbally disrespect workers.
“These people are adults, and they 
have pride in doing their jobs and 
earning their living. But because of a 
difference in income, the manage­
ment thinks they have the right to 
talk down to the employees and treat 
them like children,” said Delaney.
Delaney says that when workers 
attempt to confront their managers, 
they are penalized for speaking up.
“Some people take matters into 
their own hands — what I mean by 
that is that they stick up for them­
selves — and they get fired,” said 
Delaney.
“They’re trying to intidmidate us, I 
guess,” said an anonymous worker.

“Although we have a long way to go, we are 
getting there.” — David Kaufer, head of EnglishJobs, peers push dramats to be physically fit
by Hannah Yi
Staffwriter
If you asked an engineering major 
about the importance of their physi­
cal appearance, you’d get a variety of 
answers. In fact, any major wouldn’t 
have a straight answer. But when it 
comes to lights and cameras, there is 
a sleek shadow cast upon drama 
majors.
“Health runs parallel to our profes­
sion. We’re our own instrument, tool, 
pen and paper, so we have to be 
smart about our choices,” said Sara 
Ford, a sophomore in musical the­
atre.
In order to teach students the best
way to be healthy and safe, Barbara 
MacKenzie-Wood, associate profes­
sor of acting and coordinator of act­
ing/musical theater and Kaf
Warman, movement lecturer, are 
coordinating health workshops
planned to begin next semester. They 
want the workshops to help dispel 
the misconceptions of eating disor­
ders and steroids by reinforcing 
health awareness.
The pressure to look a certain way 
develops in part from the environ­
ment in which the drama students 
learn.
“I absolutely feel the need to main­
tain my body,” said Will Taylor, a 
senior drama major. “I get pressure 
from peers, teachers, and the indus­
try. A teacher once said to me, ‘You 
need to gain ten pounds.’ It’s been an 
ongoing battle for the past three 
years. At first I took it personally, but 
now I have enough confidence to not 
care.”
“In past years there have been 
rumors that teachers would talk to 
students about their physique,” said 
MacKenzie-Wood. “As faculty we 
strongly believe that confronting a 
student is not the best way to go. But 
as a whole, the faculty does not put 
pressure on the students to look a 
certain way.”
Just 100 acting and musical the­
ater students comprise CFA. On aver­
age, the first-year class boasts 10 
musical theater majors and 18 actors
class.
There are 12 students per acting 
class and they work together three 
times a week for two and a half 
hours; and for many, it’s these close- 
knit peers that drive physical self- 
consciousness.
“It’s an inner self-esteem issue,” 
said Kate Marilley, a sophomore in 
musical theatre. “We’re in front of 
mirrors all day in class so it’s 
inevitable that we look at our bodies 
and compare it to everyone else’s.”
It’s not as straight forward as big 
breasts, pecs, and flat tummies 
though. No official criteria, such as 
weigh-ins or physical expectationSj

Change is underway for the 
English department, says David 
Kaufer, head of the program. He 
says that he and his colleagues are 
currently working to make the lib­
eral arts a more strategic part of 
Carnegie Mellon’s academic mis­
sion.
“The president has a goal to 
have more well-rounded students 
who have gone through a broad 
educational environment. In line 
with this is a need to shape a more 
strategic humanities department,” 
says Kaufer.
It’s about how a humanities edu­
cation impacts a student’s educa­
tion, not just about learning gram­
mar.
“There’s a recognized need for 
the humanities to have a more 
strategic role in the direction in 
which the university is moving. We 
don’t have a big reputation on
campus, but we are doing interest­
ing things here and we feel that 
the University knows it and is try­
ing to make others know about it 
as well,” said Kaufer.
Currently, the English depart­
ment has a lateral connection 
across the departments. Kaufer 
believes that this will aid in creat­
ing a better reputation on campus 
for the liberal arts.
“Because we’re so small, we 
can’t have the depth of specializa­
tion, so we have to rely on later 
connections,” he said. “If you are 
an English major, or participate in 
any studies in the English and lib­
eral arts programs, you will 
engage in interdisciplinary activi­
ty. This is remarkable work that I 
don’t think is found at any other 
school.”

Roughly thirty to forty protestors, 
'with drums, pots, noisemakers, and 
signs in hand, marched down Forbes 
Avenue last night, stopping traffic for 
a quarter of a mile until police barri­
caded the road with their vehicles at 
South Craig Street. Protestors contin­

organized by the Pittsburgh

solidarity with groups in Quito, 
Ecuador protesting the Free Trade 
Agreement of the Americas (FTAA).
The protestors, mostly college-

At one point the protestors began to 
chant, “Yes to life. No to the FTAA.”
According to Alex Rodley an 
activist with POG, the march was 
organized in response to a call for 
global support from Ecuadorian 
activist groups, including indigenous 
rights groups and labor unions. Other

A Pittsburgh hero 
glad to be home
PITTSBURGH (AP) — Hall of Fame 
quarterback Terry Bradshaw received 
loud cheers and two standing ova­
tions during a halftime ceremony at 
the Steelers’ last Monday night game 
against the Colts.
It was Bradshaw’s first appearance 
at a regular-season Pittsburgh game 
since he retired following the 1983 
season, and the first time he agreed 
to be honored for his 1989 Hall of 
Fame induction.
Fans chanted “Terry Terry, Terry” 
as Bradshaw accepted his twelfth 
Steelers jersey from team president 
Dan Rooney and vice president Art 
Rooney II.
“It's good to be home,” said 
Bradshaw, who was accompanied on 
the field by his two daughters.
Bradshaw, who led the Steelers to 
four Super Bowl championships, felt 
slighted after retiring and he occa­
sionally made critical comments 
about former coach Chuck Noll. He 
felt so estranged from the Steelers he 
didn’t attend the funeral of team 
founder Art Rooney in 1988.
But Bradshaw, apparently moved 
by the death of Hall of Fame center 
Mike Webster last month, said he was 
wrong to have stayed detached from 
the Steelers. He also said he greatly 
exaggerated any talk of a strained 
relationship with Noll, and that he 
has no problems with the way Noll 
treated him during his 14-year career.
Bradshaw and Noll hugged during 
Webster’s funeral, and Bradshaw — 
now a Fox Sports NFL commentator 
— said he is now determined to stay 
close to his former teammates and 
the Steelers organization.

they could not pull the triggers on 
their guns.
“They couldn’t feel it, because such 
gas has no smell,” said Lev Fyodorov 
on Russian television. Fyodorov is a 
scientist who once worked on Soviet 
chemical weapons.
Besides 50 Chechen assailants 
reported killed at the theater, officials 
said three other gunmen were cap­
tured, and authorities searched this 
nervous city for accomplices and gun­
men who may have escaped.
The precision terror operation that 
began Wednesday night in Russia's 
capital had defied the Kremlin's 
repeated contention that the nation­
alist rebels in predominantly Muslim 
Chechnya were on the verge of final 
defeat.
A Federal Security Service official 
said the well-armed theater raiders 
had foreign links and contacts with 
unspecified embassies in Moscow, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, rais­
ing the prospect of insurgents backed 
by international terrorists plotting 
other violence in Russia.
Police officials said hours after the 
raid that 67 hostages were killed, but 
the Health Ministry later said the 
number had risen above 90.

MOSCOW (AP) — A shocked, wary 
Russia counted its rising toll of dead 
and' steeled itself for new terrorist 
blows Saturday in its never-ending 
Chechen war, after commandos strik­
ing behind clouds of disabling gas 
brought a sudden bloody end to a 
ht>stage nightmare.
' The special forces assault on a 
Mbscow theater after a three-day 
siege left Russians with feelings of 
both pain and pride: More than 90 
hostages were dead, but 750 others 
we're rescued and dozens of their 
Chechen captors killed.
Russia “cannot be forced to its 
knees,” President Vladimir Putin 
declared afterward on national tele­
vision.
But the Russian leader acknowl­
edged the heavy cost to victims’ fami­
lies? “We could not save everyone. 
Forgive us.”
: The key targets for the unidentified 
gas were almost 20 suicide attackers, 
Chechen women, who sat among the 
hostages wrapped in explosives, offi­
cials said. Had they detonated the 
charges, the toll of innocents would 
have been much higher, Deputy 
Interior Minister Vladimir Vasilyev 
said.
The incapacitating agent apparent­
ly seeped into the theater through the 
ventilation system, Moscow’s TVS 
television said, and then soldiers 
from the Alpha anti-terrorist squad 
burst in. Television footage showed 
them kicking in glass doors and open­

expert who has advised govern­
ment officials on national security 
issues, is also gearing up to direct 
an independent, state-funded 
antiterrorism research organiza­
tion.
According to Gale, the money 
for his center was originally 
offered to Penn, but the University 
declined.
ISTAR was created late last 
spring as a response to the 
Septemberll terrorist attacks. 
The collaboration of research and 
educational projects, which held 
its first event last week, is com­
prised of more than 70 adminis­
trators and faculty members.
Gale, who is not a member of 
ISTAR, will be coordinating his 
new Center for Research on 
Terrorism and Counterterrorism 
through the Foreign Policy 
Research Institute, an indepen­
dent Philadelphia organization 
that was founded by a Penn facul­
ty member in the 1960s.
Thursday, the center was offi­
cially awarded its first $1 million 
state grant.
According to Gale, that funding 
(which could potentially total $6 
million over a six-year period) 
was originally proposed in 
January by congressman Robert 
Brady as a way to help set up a uni­
versity-run terrorism center. After 
Penn declined the offer, Brady, a 
longtime friend and colleague of 
Gale’s, continued to lobby for it, 
eventually securing it for the 
Foreign Policy Research Institute.
Gale first found out about 
ISTAR in June while meeting with 
government officials in 
Washington.
Bush urges North 
Korea to disarm
CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (AP) — 
Facing a crisis in Asia, President Bush 
joined with Japan and South Korea 
on Saturday to demand that North 
Korea abandon its nuclear weapons 
program “in a prompt and verifiable 
manner.” They pledged to resolve the 
standoff peacefully.
Bush also sought support for possi­
ble war with Iraq as Pacific Rim lead­
ers that had been stung by terrorism 
gathered for their annual summit. As 
of yet, Bush has received no firm 
commitments.
The president met with South 
Korean President Kim Dae-jung and 
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi on the sidelines of the Asian- 
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, 
a two-day summit addressing terror­
ism’s impact on people and 
economies across the globe.
“The three leaders called upon 
North Korea to dismantle this pro­
gram in a prompt and verifiable man­
ner and to come into full compliance 
with all its international commit­
ments,” the three leaders said in a 
statement.
Colin Powell said it is too early to

North Korea.
Vanderbilt faces

The United Daughters of the

University in the Davidson County 
Chancery Court alleging that the 
University breached a contract 
Peabody College signed in the 
1930s with the Confederate orga­

UDC officials said they filed the 
lawsuit because they felt they had

Hildur Runa Hauksdottir stopped 
eating October 7 to try to persuade 
Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Inc. to pull 
out of the plan to build an aluminum 
smelter and hydroelectric plant in the 
wilderness area.
Environmentalists say the project 
will ruin the area above Vatnajokull, 
Europe’s largest glacier, in east 
Iceland.
Alcoa and the Icelandic govern­
ment have already started work 
building access roads and tunnels for 
the project above the Vatnajokull 
glacier.
Hauksdottir said Bjork's fame had 
helped gain publicity for the cause. 
“I’ve never used her name ever before 
but in this case it was needed,” she 
said.
Alcoa spokesman Wade Hughes 
said the firm was committed to sus­
tainable industrial development, and
“This is one of the best hydro pro­
jects being planned anywhere in the 
world,” Hughes said. “It will involve 
no relocation of people, no impact on 
endangered species, no danger to 
commercial fisheries and no denial of 
access by tourists and naturalists to 
the affected area.”

izens from the local Jewish com­
munity gathered in the 
Multipurpose Room of the Cook 
Campus Center to hear 
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett speak about 
the historical and cultural signifi­
cance of the bagel.
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, a visiting 
professor from Tisch School of the 
Arts at NYU, studied the bagel by 
looking around the world for 
traces of the original bagel and 
new variations. In this search, 
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett found a his­
tory of the Jewish people as a 
changing, assimilating culture. 
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett document­
ed the bagel's arrival in the United 
States in the 1890s from Europe. 
The bagel remained a New York 
and New Jersey Jewish delicacy 
until the late 1950s and into the 
early 1960s.
Lender's Bagels began market­
ing frozen bagels across the coun­
try in the early 1960s. This was the 
first time bagels were packaged 
and the average life of a bagel was 
prolonged, she said. Before this 
time, a bagel only lasted a few days 
as they were made with few ingre­
dients and no preservatives, which
prohibited travel outside the tri­
state area. "A beautiful bagel is a 
fresh bagel," Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 
said.
Healthy eating is 
found unwise
Kent, Oh. (U-WIRE) — 
Orthorexia Nervosa is not your 
typical disorder. It begins inno­
cently enough, with a person’s 
desire to eat healthy. This desire 
then turns into an obsession with 
food that takes over every aspect 
of that person’s life.
In his book “Health Food Junkies: 
Overcoming the Obsession of 
Healthy Eating, ” Stephen Bratman, 
a doctor, has coined the term 
orthorexia nervosa as “fixation on 
eating healthy food.” While this 
may mirror anorexia, those with 
this disorder do not eliminate food 
altogether in most cases.
Certain foods are eliminated 
periodically as a way for the 
orthorexic to raise their self­
esteem.
For example, a person may 
begin eating all kinds of fruits and 
vegetables, then taper off to only 
cooked and uncooked vegetables 
and eventually only eat raw veg­
etables.
In the most extreme cases, 
Bratman says, there are those who 
call themselves “breatharians,” 
who try to live on air alone.
Bratman said orthorexia differs 
from other eating disorders 
because it is mostiy psychological.
Orthorexics usually begin eating 
healthy as a way to improve their 
quality of life.
As the food obsession grows, 
their weight loss gives them a 
sense of self-esteem and euphoria.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Leading 
Democrats reached out to former 
Vice President Walter Mondale on 
Saturday, seeking a potent replace­
ment candidate for the late Paul 
Wellstone in a race that could deter­
mine control of the Senate in the new 
Congress.
As federal investigators searched 
the wreckage of the small plane that 
carried Wellstone and seven others to 
their death, Senate Majority Leader 
Tom Daschle and the head of the 
party’s campaign committee both 
talked with Mondale by phone.
The 74-year-old former vice presi­
dent and Minnesota senator made no 
public comment, and none seemed 
likely before Wellstone’s funeral.
However, several Democratic Party 
officials, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said Mondale had not 
rejected the overtures that began 
within hours of Wellstone’s death on 
Friday, and they took that as a sign he 
might be receptive.
“No one has been ruled in or out,” 
said Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., 
who heads the Democratic campaign 
committee. She said she had spoken 
with Mondale as well as a number of 
state officials in Minnesota.
Party officials said Daschle, too, 
had spoken with the former vice pres­
ident, an attorney who lives in the 
Minneapolis area. Democratic 
sources said prominent labor leaders 
had expressed interest in Mondale as 
well.
State Democratic Party Chairman 
Mike Erlandson said Wellstone won’t 
be replaced until after the family has 
made funeral arrangements.

Students decry 
Police as racists
by Andrew Conklin
Staffwriter
Allegations of racism within its 
police force are stirring the 
University of Pittsburgh community 
into a fervor. After the events of 
October 18, when campus police 
forcibly dispersed a party held by his- 
torically-black fraternity Phi Beta 
Sigma and its sister sorority Zeta Phi 
Beta, utilizing K-9 units and, accord­
ing to some, excessive force, ques­
tions regarding the prejudices and 
motivations of the campus police 
contingent have grown louder and 
stronger.
“Everyone knows that the Pitt 
police are racist, and this just con­
firms it,” said Robert Basham, a CAS 
sophomore. “If it had been white kids 
partying and one fight broke out, the 
police probably wouldn’t have done 
anything.”
Many Pitt students, black and 
white, share Basham’s sentiments. 
Student forums are peppered with 
reports of racial profiling by campus 
police.
“One night my friends and I were 
walking back from a party, and a Pitt 
police car followed us all the way 
home,” said an African-American stu­
dent who asked to remain anony­
mous. “We hadn’t given them any 
reason to be suspicious, but they still 
trailed us.”
Indeed, the University has had this 
problem brought to their attention 
before.
Last February, state representa­
tives conducted a hearing sponsored 
by the House Education Committee 
at Pitt’s Student Union. The hearing 
dealt with race issues on university 
campuses. Disturbing statistics and 
reports were presented to the panel, 
including the disproportionately 
heavy police surveillance of predomi- 
nantly-African-American gatherings, 
and the fact that Pennsylvania leads 
the nation in hate group activity.
“Not Mississippi, not Alabama. 
Pennsylvania,” said Lavera Brown at 
the meeting, executive director of the 
Pittsburgh NAACP (National 
Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People), who then recom­
mended that the university cultivate
diversity and an appreciation for 
other cultures to deal with apparent 
racism.
Also discussed was the failure of 
Pitt’s police to investigate all of the 
accusations of racial profiling, or 
even to track statistics of such inci­
dents and complaints, a practice 
which communities generally expect 
of their police forces.
“The way to deal with these issues 
is not to ignore them, but to either 
show they aren’t issues, or to find the 
problems and handle them,” said 
Mya Brown, a CAS senior, speaking 
about the accusations against the Pitt 
police.
Despite these criticisms, the Pitt 
police have remained staunchly 
silent. Chief Tim Delaney would not 
comment about anything race-relat- 
ed. Attempts to obtain a copy of the 
incident report for the altercation at 
the Pitt Union were also denied.
“I don’t know what it’ll take to get 
fair treatment from them [the Pitt 
police], but I hope this gets resolved 
soon, before something serious hap­
pens,” said Basham. “Using dogs to 
break up a Friday night party? 
Punching a girl in the face? This 
needs to end.”
Summer Haston, a Zeta Phi Beta 
member, told Pitt News she was 
punched in the face by a Pitt police 
officer during the incident. Haston 
told the Pitt News she will be filing 
charges against the officer. Whether 
they are siding with police or not, 
most students agree that the current 
state of relations between the two 
parties is unacceptable, is detrimen­
tal to a safe and supportive collegiate 
community, and that action must be 
taken to remedy the situation.
“This conflict between the police 
and black students can be dealt with 
if both sides can compromise and 
give each other the benefit of the 
doubt,” said Brown. “No one’s saying 
it will be an easy process, but any­
thing is preferable to the way things 
are now.”

CMU receives $1.9 
million for courses
CMU has been granted a 
three-year, $1.9 million grant from 
The William and Flora Hewlett 
Foundation to fund the development 
and implementation of four Internet- 
based courses. The courses, in statis­
tics, causal reasoning, economics, 
and logic, will be available free of 
charge to CMU students. Other col­
leges and high schools will also be 
able to access them for a small fee.
Already developed are Formal 
Logic and Causal Reasoning with 
Statistical Data courses. Introductory 
Microeconomics and Introductory 
Statistics will be produced next.
“We believe this project will enable 
us to create a self-sustaining infra­
structure that will provide opportuni­
ties to create not only online courses 
but also Web-based course materi­
als,” said lead researcher Joel Smith, 
vice provost for computing services. 
“Our goal here is not to replace all 
college education with online cours­
es, but rather to explore what can be 
done with introductory classes, 
which are usually large-lecture for­
mat to begin with.”
Speaker will speak 
of early US botany
Harry A. Alden, a microscopist 
from the Smithsonian Center for 
Material Research and Education, 
will speak at Carnegie Mellon on 
Thursday November 21, the latest in 
the University’s Lecture Series.
The lecture is free and open to the 
public. The topic of the lecture will be 
“Preliminary Examination of Plant 
Material from the Lewis & Clark 
Expedition,” and will be held in the 
Adamson Wing of Baker Hall.
Although its subject to debate, 
some historians believe that 
Merriwether Lewis launched his keel-
boat from Pittsburgh, marking it as 
an important expedition. Ndw' 
almost 200 years later, some of the 
plants that the two explorers collect­
ed on their journey will be show­
cased at Pittsburgh’s own CMU.
During the 1803-1806 expedition; 
Lewis and Clark collected more than 
200 plant specimens. They now. 
reside in The Academy of Natural 
Sciences in Philadelphia.
In 1998, small samples were 
removed from eleven of the original
200 specimens for chemical and 
anatomical analysis. Alden will be 
presenting the findings of their con­
dition and says that from preliminary 
data, most samples demonstrate 
“exquisite preservation at the cellu­
lar level.”
SEI expands into' 
Europe; Germany
CMU has announced the expansion 
of its Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI) with the opening of an office at 
An der Welle 4 in central Frankfurt, 
Germany. The opening is in response 
to strong demand for the develop­
ment of products based on quality 
software. The SEI-Europe, in partner­
ship with its licensees, will provide 
the training, knowledge and research 
to do this. CMU Provost Mark Kamlet 
said the opening of an office in 
Europe enhances CMU and the 
Software Engineering Institute’s abil­
ity to serve its European research cus­
tomers.
“By expanding our borders interna­
tionally, Carnegie Mellon is posi-. 
tioned to provide top-tier educational 
resources, and research and develop­
ment opportunities,” Kamlet said. ' !r
“The office in Europe serves as an 
important gateway for us and embod­
ies the principles of education and 
training on which Carnegie Mellon 
was founded.”
Heading the SEI-Europe office is 
Geir Fagerhus, founder and former 
chief executive officer of Q-Labs, ia 
leading international professional 
services company specializing in soft^ 
ware engineering practices head­
quartered in Denmark. ' ^

Plans arranged by Provost Mark Kamlet have the Career Center gaining 1,200 square feet by moving into the UC basement. 
The empty Warner Hall space would then house additional Enrollment Services and international education offices.Early plans sketched for UC improvement
Workers grumble over dining managers

Zack Deighan, who recently handed his two-week notice to Parkhurst, doesn’t 
feel the same constraints his coworkers do.
RENOVATIONS, from page A1Jobbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
ize,” said Murphy.
According to Murphy, the proposal 
is the result of the findings by the 
Exploratory Space Task Force, a col­
lection of students, staff, faculty, and 
administrators headed by Murphy 
last spring.
The task force researched the cur­
rent availability of open space on 
campus and how these spaces could 
best be used.
The group was supposed to make a 
recommendation on the vacant 
Highlander Café, but no one would 
give up on dining possibilities in the 
Resnik House locale. One idea had 
the University Shoppe’s textbook 
store moving into Highlander to free 
Up space for the recreational com­
plex.
The recent proposal coalesced in 
the last two months when Provost 
Mark Kamlet brought together sever­
al departments looking for space. 
Orginally, the University planned to 
use space in the school’s University 
Technology Development Center 
(UTDC) near Craig Street for the 
expansion of the Office of Sponsored 
Research and the University 
Advancement’s Development depart­
ment, which actively seeks donations 
and other revenue sources for the 
University. Instead, that space will 
now be used by an external renter, 
creating a revenue stream to fund the 
Career Center’s relocation. 
Recreational development was added 
to the project to reduce construction 
costs in developing the basement 
according to Murphy. An internal 
loan of $800,000 will be used to con- 
átruct the recreational half of the pro­
ject.

Student senate fall elections hap­
pen the same week in October each 
year, and they still catch students by 
surprise when they see the ballots 
outside of academic buildings.
“I’m not well-informed enough to 
Vote responsibly,” said Chris Borer, a 
first-year mechanical engineering 
•major. One setback is that candidate 
platforms are posted the day of the 
elections. Submittal of a platform is 
¦also optional.
Quinten Steenhuis, an H&SS 
Senator, explained that normally the 
names of the candidates come out 
the week before the elections in The 
Tartan but since mid-semester break 
fell on this week, the names could not 
be printed.
Petitions for student government 
•do not have to be submitted until 10 
[days before the election and causes a 
¡“last-minute notice” of who exactly 
will run for office.
Last semester, over 2,000 students 
¡voted in the senate spring elections, 
¡concurrent with the election of stu­
dent body president and other execu­
tives.
! In 2001, only 929 votes were 
¡counted in the spring elections. 
Tomorrow and Wednesday will be 
•the last time students vote in the fall.
I Usually elections for student gov­
ernment executives — in the spring 
;— see the greatest student involve­
ment.
| Government hopes to boost their 
¡voting pool and thus instituted a 
'once-a-year election policy.
I “We want to put all efforts into this 
¡one special event,” said Brian Namey, 
¡student body president, 
i The decision was made last year by 
¡the student government reform com­
mittee, comprised of Namey, former 
'student body president Adam 
Hajfber, and various student groups
and Enrollment Services. Kamlet esti­
mated that the new Career Center 
and the refurbishment of the Warner 
Hall basement may cost $900,000.
Murphy and Namey are both 
expecting the recreational area to 
benefit Dining Services through an 
increase in traffic to dining and other 
social areas within the building. 
Increased demand from students 
could lead to more hours of service 
and more business for food vendors. 
It is unclear whether the quality of 
food served would be affected.
Ultimately, the University would 
like to build a much larger Career 
Center, but funding has remained 
elusive for such a project. The new 
center is expected to be a four to five 
year transitional space.
The building of the Career Center 
is being coupled with a fitness center 
because both would require work in 
the basement. The goal is to drive 
down the cost of both projects by 
combining them.
The proposed fitness facility would 
increase the fitness space available to 
students in the building by nearly 60 
percent. Also, the dance room does 
not provide privacy from the dining 
areas in the hall.
“I wish there was more workout 
equipment in the UC. When I go, 
there are too many people on the 
pieces I like to use,” said £asey 
Kunimura, first-year engineering stu­
dent who acknowledges that Skibo 
Gym has more of the weight equip­
ment he desires, but doesn’t like to 
walk so far.
Carol Liu, sophomore computer 
science student, said, “I think there 
could be more recreation space.” She 
went on to say that the facilities that 
do exist could be in better condition 
and more appealing.
“This is a good thing for students,” 
Murphy said. “It also creates opportu­
nities for better fund-raising and bet-
including, the Student Dormitory 
Committee and the Graduate 
Student Assembly.
“We wanted to streamline the sys­
tem and increase voter turnout,” said 
Katie Warren, elections board chair.
“Fall elections tend to be less publi­
cized that the spring elections,” said 
Sivanipriya Nattama, an incumbent 
senator running for reelection. “I told 
my friends that I’m running and they 
said ‘Oh, we have senators?’ ”
Warren hopes that the larger elec­
tions will cause a greater involve­
ment in the election process by the 
candidates so that the preparation 
for the elections will be easier.
“If competition increases,, more 
platforms will be submitted,” said 
Warren. Student Government ulti­
mately wants to have all students 
running for positions to personally 
address voters by way of a public dis­
cussion.
A
ter career services space more cen­
trally located.”
Because of the University’s tight 
budget, though, tough choices will 
have to be made on how to spend 
money for the space.
At a discussion of the plan on 
Wednesday, October 16 amongst stu­
dent organization leaders and admin­
istrative stakeholders, Activities 
Board representatives expressed a 
desire for small and medium-sized 
performance venues.
Other groups, such as WRCT, said 
the plan should include additional 
storage space for organizations. A 
burgeoning record library has forced 
the radio station to move CDs from 
jewel cases to sleeves to conserve 
space.
One main issue with the develop­
ment of such a large fitness center is 
the pillars supporting the structure of 
the UC.
Because the basement was built in 
1995 as an empty shell, the support 
columns were laid out in a standard 
grid. These columns cannot be modi­
fied without jeopardizing the struc­
tural integrity of the building.
“One pillar may be the death knell 
on dance,” said Murphy, emphasizing 
the nascent stage of discussions for 
the space. Namey said, however, that 
the negative effects of the pillars do 
not negate the benefits of the addi­
tional workout space.
According ' to Murphy, meeting 
rooms, storage space, and even a cen­
tralized mailroom were all discussed 
by the Exploratory Task Force in 
April.
Murphy said, however, that space 
is simply an element that just about 
every department would like, but 
only a few have the attached dollars 
to complete.

Normally, not every vacancy in 
senate is filled by the end of the elec­
tion period. Students may try to gain 
support for their own platforms well 
into the school year.
Once they have gathered 25 signa­
tures for their petition, the candi­
dates can go before the student sen­
ate and give an oral platform where 
they are appointed by senate vote on

have for addressing their issues with 
management is to file a grievance 
with the union. But according to 
Delaney, even that puts the workers 
at risk.
“They’ll [dining employees] call 
here and complain, but they won’t 
document it — they’re afraid to put 
it in writing. If they file a grievance, 
management will just make their 
lives more miserable. They’re intimi­
dated,” says Delaney.
The other thing that makes it hard 
for the workers to come forward 
about management conduct is the 
lack of evidence. Delaney said that 
the managers purposely mistreat 
workers when no one else is around 
to witness' it.
“When they do file a grievance, 
there’s no proof. Management sin­
gles them out. They catch the work­
ers when they’re on their own,” said 
Delaney.
Aside from verbal abuse and limi­
tations on their ability to file com­
plaints, many workers feel that they 
are understaffed and underpaid. 
Their salaries start at $6 per hour. If 
they work for 180 hours, they can 
join the union and their salaries go 
up, but according to Deighan, few 
workers earn more than $8 per hour.
Delaney said the pay scale is not 
competitive.
“They wanted rates to be lower 
than they are now. At our last nego­
tiation they had a ridiculous rate sit­
ting on the table. I said ‘no,’ ” said 
Delaney.
Deighan said Fahringer refuses to 
hire more workers, that she has been 
told of the understaffing problem 
many times, but that in order to keep 
Parkhurst’s profits high, she hires as 
few workers as possible and only 
gives them overtime when there is 
no other choice.
“They skimp on hours, and we 
need more people but they don’t 
want to pay for the manpower,” said 
Deighan.
“They’ll stretch you out,” said an 
anonymous worker, explaining that 
she was about to sit down for the 
first time in seven hours.

plinary activity and fostering it as an 
important part of University activity.
She is now a chair on the humani­
ties committee, a cross-disciplinary 
group devoted to strategizing about 
how humanities can make a differ­
ence at Carnegie Mellon.
“I am shepherding this program 
through the process because I 
believe that we’re at an interesting 
point at the history of the University 
where things can change between 
the humanities and the rest of the 
University. We must be very vocal 
about who we are and what our 
value is,” said Straub.
To Straub, this value is not only 
for those in the department, but for 
outsiders as well.
“[A] strong humanities [program] 
is important for any student on our 
campus. We all need to be effective 
writers, communicators and ana­
lysts, and must be able to really 
understand a text in the context of 
society,” she said.
The humanities committee, there­
fore, is trying to promote interdisci­
plinary activity between the human­
ities and social sciences in an 
attempt to not only give outside stu­
dents the opportunity to engage in 
the liberal arts, but to enhance the 
reputation of the liberal arts on cam­
pus as well.
“I’d like us to gradually change 
outside of the interpretation of CMU 
as a technical school.- We’re not. 
That is not all we do,” said Straub.
English professor Kathy Newman 
believes that this change in attitude 
must happen internally, from the 
faculty and the university heads.
“The tone can’t change at the level 
of the students. Change must come 
from the leaders of the university 
and faculty through curricular 
change, vocal support for the 
President and greater physical pres­
ence of the humanities at the 
University.”
For,1 many students and professors, 
these changes are long overdue.
Kathy Newman, a graduate of UC 
Berkeley and Yale University — both 
schools with a heavy tradition in the 
humanities — was dismayed to see 
the small role that the humanities 
played in the lives of students at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“I think we, as a university, need 
to work harder to make humanities 
more central to the mission without 
sacrificing the autonomy that 
English professors currently have.”
As a professor in the liberal arts 
program at Carnegie Mellon, Peggy 
Knapp also sees the small presence 
of the humanities as a problem, but 
doesn’t let it discourage her.
Instead, she likes being the 
underdog.
“Hike being the loyal opposition,” 
said Knapp. “I have a big investment 
in this school and I think that seeing
Fahringer declined comment on 
the understaffing problem, saying 
only that she believes Parkhurst cur­
rently employs roughly 40 full-time 
workers and 30 part-time workers, 
and that this seems satisfactory to 
her.
Deighan said that it is only since 
Parkhurst took over from CMU that 
conditions have been so bad.
“When CMU ran it, it was a lot 
cleaner. There’s days now where 
they’ve been getting walkthrough’s 
and the place is just filthy. When 
CMU ran it, we got unlimited over­
time, and the benefits were better. If 
you worked here full-time, you got 
one free class per semester, free 
buses, free Andrew accounts. We 
used to go to Schatz to get hamburg­
ers and stuff, but now we’re not 
allowed to eat the expensive items. 
We can’t even get free parking pass­
es, although management does,” he
the liberal arts as, in a certain sense, 
the second best or margin, rather 
than the center of this university, 
has made me aware of how much I 
do want to defend it as a necessary 
cornerstone.”
Her investment in the university 
can be translated into the thirty 
years that she has spent teaching at 
Carnegie Mellon, during which she 
has seen a number of changes in the 
English program and its reputation.
“When I first came, we were the 
second largest department next to 
electrical engineering. It hasn’t got­
ten any smaller, but other places 
have gotten larger.”
“I’d like us to 
gradually change 
outside interpre­
tation of CMU as 
a technical school. 
We’re not. That is 
not all we do.”
—Kristina Straub
She believes that the reason for 
the stagnant nature of the English 
department is found in the increas­
ingly “profession-oriented” nature of 
the other programs.
“All the departments became 
more aimed at direct career choices 
and so the engineers tend to make 
choices that are closer to their pro­
fessional goals.”
The English department began in 
1968 as a service for those studying 
in a technical field. Because 
Carnegie Mellon had established 
technological advancement as its 
foundation, the humanities were not 
a focus of the school. Today, it 
remains clear that the English 
department is physically smaller 
when compared to the more profes­
sion-oriented departments in MCS, 
CIT, and the business school.
This, according to Knapp, causes 
the University to produce students 
who are not well-rounded and able 
to relate to a human world once they 
graduate.
“If a student really wishes to 
become part of modern society, he 
first has to have some idea of what 
things have been like in the past. 
Then, he needs to learn how to inter­
pret complex issues in a broader 
social context. He’s no more than a 
trained technician if he cannot enter 
into the lives of the people around 
him.”
The problem is more than just the 
mission of the university, however. 
The main problem according to Jane 
Bernstein, a professor of creative
i
said.
Many employees said that the dif­
ference was that CMU’s objective 
was to provide a service to the stu­
dents, whereas Parkhurst is solely 
interested in making a profit, which 
is also the reason that prices are so 
high while the value of the food 
seems to remain so low.
“James Poole, our executive chef, 
will come in and yell at us and try to 
make us put more lettuce in the sal­
ads, so they’re cheaper for Parkhurst 
but they can still charge the same,” 
said one anonymous worker. Poole 
denied the claim, but refused further 
comment.
“All they want is money. They’re 
here for the business; they don’t care 
about anything else,” said another 
anonymous worker.
“We’re here as a business,” said 
Fahringer.
to its benefit
writing, is found in the deprivation 
of the humanities amongst students 
in other programs who rarely 
engage in the liberal arts.
“Technology has nothing to do 
with the human heart, things like 
love and jealousy, which are found 
in poetry and fiction,” said 
Bernstein.
“People turn to break the frozen 
sea inside of them when they engage 
in literature and have some under­
standing of themselves in this world. 
It’s sad when people get a technical 
education and can’t enter into the 
world of self.”
However, many technology stu­
dents are happy with the way things 
are, and do not see the need for 
change.
“I don’t think there is a whole lot 
of application,” said Aaron Welsh, a 
junior chemical engineering major.
“There is a need for writing 
because there’s always going to be a 
need for people to write, but for 
those who are studying literature, I 
don’t see what they’re going to do as 
far as getting a job. Other than teach 
other people who are trying to 
study.”
Welsh does not think that he is 
unable to relate to others because of 
his lack of a liberal arts education.
“It’s not like I’m an automaton. 
Just because I don’t read, doesn’t 
mean that I can’t be a part of society. 
I have my own experiences and form 
my own opinions.”
Welsh feels that what is important 
is that he gain applicable job skills.
For Knapp, this is not enough.
“I think that students and this uni­
versity ought to be interested in the 
beauty and pleasure of cultural 
activity, not just in its analysis and 
knowledge bearing possibility, but in 
the fun of it.
Moreover, there is a reputation 
amongst the students that says that 
the study of English and the human­
ities is an easier path to take, making 
the prospect of taking English class­
es less appealing to outside students.
“There is a lot of myth-making at 
the level of the students. But I will 
tell them to take one of my classes 
and see how difficult it really is,” 
said Knapp.
Michael Scotto, a junior creative 
writing and English double major, 
knows how much work it is and feels 
it unfair when others do not 
acknowledge how much work he 
has.
“I have to do between 400 and 
700 pages of reading a week, with a 
paper also due every week. I have to 
work. It’s a challenging program,” 
said Scotto. Yet, it’s not the technical 
student buried in reading.
“The changes are not as visible 
yet, but after having been at CMU 
for the past 20 years, I can tell you 
that the attitude towards the 
humanities is better,” said Kaufer. 
“Although we have a long way to go, 
we are getting there.”

much of the discussion revolved 
around what the panel regarded as 
the biggest loophole in the system, 
the average PC user.
“The best way to improve Internet 
security is to have hardware and soft­
ware manufactured with security in 
mind,” said Schmidt. “Home comput­
er users should use antivirus soft­
ware and update it regularly and 
should install a computer firewall.”
“In the software industry, products 
are valued above secure products,” 
said former chairman and CEO of 
PrintCafe Software, William 
Guttman.
“Security is rarely a part of the 
essential desired features list,” said 
Guttman, now the director of sustain­
able computing consortium for the 
Heinz School of Public Policy and 
Management.
CMU students can opt to tighten up 
security on their own computers 
through the University.
“You can download the Symantec
AntiVirus software off the My 
Andrew website. Running that will; 
protect you from most attacks,” said 
John Lerchey, computer network 
security coordinator for Carnegie; 
Mellon, in an interview after the; 
meeting.
The panel asserted, however, that' 
in the post-September 11 era, this; 
overall trend is changing. A major 
facet of CIPB’s strategy is to encour­
age secure connections between both 
Internet service providers and the 
product users.
Lerchey said that the most recent 
and pressing security issue at CMU is 
“administrative share.”
“In some PCs, the C drive [main 
storage] is sharable to the adminis­
trator, and hackers are able to access 
any files they want to,” he said

held in New York and Los Angeles, 
students perform for agents in hope 
of recruitment after graduation. 
Professors frown upon the sudden 
urgency of students that work out.
“We don’t encourage them to start 
intense exercise just for an audi­
tion,” said Warman. “Students 
should start freshman year or earlier 
so they gradually build up strength 
and make it a routine. This is more 
effective than cramming fitness in 
right before an audition.”
Agent recruitment after Leagues is 
very likely for students.
“Quite a high number of our 
seniors receive offers from agents or 
are recommended to companies 
right away. Most of these agents and 
managers want the students to sign 
on immediately,” said Judy Conte, 
senior lecturer in dance. “In the one 
month period between the New York 
showcase in May and the Los 
Angeles showcase in June, most are 
introduced to agents that provide 
employment for the summer and 
fall.”

something that’s at epidemic pro­
portions,” said Warman.
“Ripped Fuel and Creatine are 
popular among the male drama 
majors,” said Tyler Polle, a junior 
drama major.
Ripped Fuel is a stimulant that 
increases metabolism and gives an 
energy boost, which helps decrease 
body fat. Side effects include nau­
sea, cramps, and an increased heart 
rate.
Those who take it to detrimental 
levels may encounter strokes or 
heart attacks.
Creatine provides additional ener­
gy to the muscles, facilitating weight 
lifting.
The muscle cells also absorb more 
water and as a result increase the 
volume of the muscles while provid­
ing protein.
Students that do not take Creatine 
supplements in moderation can have 
adverse side effects such as nausea, 
muscle cramps, and renal stress.
“We’re all pretty careful about it,” 
said Polle. “We take it to bulk up and 
get the most out of our workouts. 
But come senior year right before 
Leagues, everyone’s at the gym and 
they start taking everything under 
the sun.”

“The conservatory accepts stu­
dents according to talent,” said 
MacKenzie-Wood. “If you were to 
poke your head into classroom to 
classroom you would see that stu­
dents are not all one body type and 
not all thin. We do not accept only 
one body type. There’s a rather large 
range, in both the men and the 
women, in terms of body type and 
size.”
It really is as much about action as 
lights and cameras. Movement class­
es, for example, require an immense 
amount of physical activity which 
gradually builds students’ stamina 
and performance. And while the 
close-knit drama community may 
cause a certain amount of physical 
competition, the same quality may 
help keep dramats afloat in stressful 
times. In class, and shows, and soci­
ety, drama students interact with 
each other constantly. Students and 
professors hold each other account­
able, and worried students will 
approach professors for discrete 
help.

the White House town meeting on 
Thursday evening in McConomy 
Auditiorium. President Bush’s special 
assistant for cyberspace security, as 
well as leaders of Carnegie Mellon’s 
CERT Coordination Center and the 
Mellon Financial Group, held a panel 
discussion on the National Strategy 
to Secure Cyberspace, a document 
recently submitted to the public.
“Never before have discussions 
such as these been brought to the 
public prior to the implementation of 
the policies,” said Howard Schimdt, 
vice chairman of the President’s 
Critical Infrastructure Protection 
Board (CIPB), and the author of the 
paper.
Most of the meeting centered on 
security policies as protection against 
malicious attacks from abroad, but
Readme articles evoke student disdain
nate that it mentioned the specific 
names of the Greek institutions and 
that readme satirized such tangible 
topics as rape and eating disorders.
“Bringing out stereotypes that 
aren’t a part of our community, as 
well as pointing at and using the spe­
cific names of the organizations is 
ridiculous and just wrong,” said Katie 
Warren, a senior business major and 
president of Kappa Alpha Theta. 
“Especially making light of the topic 
of date rape, in light of the recent 
attacks on campus. It’s abhorrent.”
Delta Delta Delta, the sorority 
mentioned most frequently, declined 
official comment, except to say they 
will act in response to the issue.
Fred Merkle, president of AB and 
senior ECE major, says he is unaware 
of any stir caused by readme.
“AB has not heard any of these con­
cerns. If and when they are expressed 
to us, we can take action. Until then, 
we must rely upon the exclusively 
positive feedback that we get about 
readme,” said Merkle. He says that 
while readme may contain controver­
sial topics, it is not meant to offend.
“It’s about providing a satirical 
magazine to offset the rigors of CMU 
life,” he said.
Despite repeated attempts to 
arrange an interview, readme editor 
Alex Schimel, said he was unavail­
able for comment. Merkle does not 
think that readme has changed drasti­
cally since Schimel has been editor.
“Different editors lend different 
touches to papers. Alex has not 
changed the mission since when we 
started,” said Merkle. When the latest 
edition was printed and delivered to 
the University Center on Thursday, 
advisors in the office of Student 
Activities read it and suggested to 
Merkle that his organization should 
review the content again. AB advisor 
Jamie Rossi said there was no inten­
tion to censor the issue. She said 
Student Activities would never pro­
hibit AB from publishing and distrib­
uting an issue. It was the first time 
this semester Rossi had suggested 
that AB “revisit” their decision.
The readme staff ultimately decid­
ed in the eleventh hour that some of 
the original may have been in poor 
taste and not funny to boot, accord­
ing to Merkle. The issue was reprint­
ed and distributed Friday.
Absent from the final release was a 
second page article, “White Student 
Association Celebrates Heritage, 
Supremacy.” The story included a 
picture of a Confederate flag being 
held up by persons in Ku Klux Klan 
sheets and hoods between West Wing 
and Resnik Houses. The article men­
tioned issues such as affirmative 
action, lynching minorities, and 
cross-burning.
The original issue included the 
same text on homosexuals but was 
located on the front page, and the 
accompanying picture featured a 
locker room with four men clad only 
in jockstraps taking a shower togeth­
er. In the released copy, the text had 
been moved to page two and was 
accompanied by a new picture. The 
text still struck a nerve.
“Even though it’s silly to say 
readme is homophobic, there is a 
marked difference between this arti­
cle and the kind of thing they usually 
publish,” said Li. He said that 
although much of the readme’s mate­
rial is harmless and very funny, he 
was disappointed in some of their 
recent work.
“We removed the article because 
we felt that it was disrespectful to our 
audience. We decided that we were 
better off reprinting,” said Merkle.
For some at least, AB made the 
right move. v'.
“This is zoning in on race issues 
which are really sensitive here. I 
mean, lynching? I know its satire, but 
that’s too much,” said Kakia Moto,,a 
first year H&SS student and member

motes black awareness on campus. ¦

outside of school, instead of issues 
that concern where we are, that 
everyone knows about,” said MotO

Readme calls itself a humor paper, 
but some students are not laughing at 
the Activities Board publication.
“I feel like some of the stuff has 
been going too far. I mean, there’s no 
such thing as ‘harmless humor.’ 
You’re going to offend somebody, but 
some of those articles are wrong. 
They’re going to make students feel 
uncomfortable,” said Ricardo Rush, a 
first year design major.
On Friday, readme published an 
article entitled “Gay Students Spend 
Extra Long Time in Locker Room,” 
causing some discontent among 
CMU’s gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
transgender (GLBT) groups.
“It really undermines our efforts to 
combat homophobia,” said Simon Li, 
a sophomore H&SS Interdisciplinary 
major and president of CMUOUT, a 
student organization that promotes 
social activities and fights stereotypes 
within CMU’s GLBT community. “The 
sad thing is that some people might 
actually believe it’s true,” said Li after 
reading the article.
The article’s genesis was a research 
study that aimed to determine why 
“homosexuals are so sexy looking.” 
The article quoted a football player 
eager to shower with his teammates 
and a fictitious gay student, who 
described showering with other men 
as one of the “perks of the lifestyle.”
In the previous issue, published on 
October 10, readme printed a front­
page article entitled “Sororities to 
Critics: ‘No, You’re the Sluts,’ ” 
accompanied by a picture of an 
unconscious female with her dress 
pulled up to her waist and fraternity 
letters scrawled on her upper thighs. 
The article included several stereo­
types of the Greek community, from 
the notion that sororities are promis­
cuous, materialistic, and anorexic, to 
the characterization of Greek males 
as predatory date rapists and alco­
holics. Some students felt that while 
the article was funny, it was unfortu-
run.
“It’s true that they have jobs, but 
it’s forcing them to take a job where 
they’re mistreated,” he said. “If they 
had their own economic system 
without the interference of other 
organizations, it would take longer, 
but they could work on creating 
their own economic system that 
works for them.”
Mostly college-aged men and 
women attended the rally, some 
from the University of Pittsburgh 
and CMU. Tim Vining, executive 
director of the Thomas Merton 
Center, a center for social justice in 
Pittsburgh, said he was there in sup­
port of the movement. Members of 
the Pittsburgh Anarchist group came 
dressed in black. A group dressed in 
pink showed support for queer 
awareness and acceptance.

scope. It would allow for free trade 
between all countries in the Western 
hemisphere except Cuba. One 
activist referred to it as “NAFTA on 
steroids.”
The plan is projected for 2005 but 
waits to be decided as many nations 
in the south debate its benefits.
“It’s a lot larger and systemic than 
NAFTA,” Rodley said. “It’s likely to 
give corporations rights people don’t 
think they should have.”
According to Branden Dudek, an 
activist, the FTAA would allow 
American companies to sell their 
commodities in foreign countries at 
lower prices than local companies 
could afford to, thus forcing those 
smaller companies out of business 
and driving the profits out of that 
country.
“It forces them into poverty. It 
forces them to take out loans from 
financial organizations such as the 
WTO and IMF, and it basically 
enslaves them by making them pay 
off loans to these organizations,” 
said Dudek.

dent attending CCAC, said the FTAA

UC renovations a prime chance 
to better students’ quality of life

appropriate functions. When the group con­
vened last March, they had hoped to find a 
new purpose for the former Highlander 
Cafeteria but were unwilling to write off its 
future as a dining hall.
The dismissal of Highlander as a versatile 
space marks a disturbing trend in University 
construction. Last spring, the school final­
ized its master plan, but failed to respond 
adequately to the problems of Highlander, 
the dilapidated Skibo Gymnasium, or the UC 
basement. Perhaps the University should 
take a closer look at these inefficiently uti­
lized spaces before launching a $700,000 
renovation of the UC second floor.
Murphy justifies the proposed renova­
tions, saying that there was no demand for a 
new student congregation space until 18 to 
24 months ago. Supposing Murphy’s claim is 
true, then one must consider that if student 
desires can change within a period of two 
years, the renovations may be short-sighted 
and unimpressive to future students.
Regardless of the future of UC recreation 
space, the University plans to develop 6,000 
square feet of the basement for the tempo­
rary quarters of the Career Center. The move 
will free space in Warner Hall for an expand­
ed Development office, the University’s 
fundraising overseer that is woefully under­
sized, according to Murphy. What will hap­
pen to that 6,000 square feet once the Career 
Center finds a corporate donor and leaves its 
subterranean digs for a new structure, 
Murphy does not know.
Murphy has stressed that all UC renova­
tion designs will weigh heavily on student 
sentiment. Student Body President Brian 
Namey has formed an ad hoc committee to 
generate ideas, and a town meeting will be 
held in early to mid November. The tight 
schedule means that students with a pas­
sionate vision for their University Center 
must let it be known immediately.
The University released a plan two weeks 
ago that would place an expanded Career 
Center and athletic facilities in the basement 
of the University Center. It is ironic, consid­
ering that just two years ago, CMU nearly 
opened an Intel corporate research center in 
the same space. Student outcry nixed the 
Intel proposal, which violated the building’s 
mission statement and was riddled with 
publicity failures. Since the University 
Center’s 1997 opening, The Tartan has 
argued that the building’s desolate base­
ment is an underlying asset that should be 
used to its fullest potential for the benefit of 
students. Students should have the final say 
in the use of the University Center basement, 
be it as a centralized mailroom, a bowling 
alley, or a video game center.
The UC renovation proposal from a 
Student Affairs committee calls for moving 
athletic facilities from the second floor to 
the basement and using the second floor as 
a lounge and recreational space with pool 
tables, ping pong tables, and video games. 
This proposed congregation area would add 
critical mass to the dining gallery. The area 
might not be quite as robust and glitzy as 
Dave & Buster’s, per Student Body President 
Brian Name/s description, but it is a major 
coup for UC food vendors.
Whether Parkhurst, who provides CMU’s 
dining services, can handle the influx of stu­
dent diners that an improved eating area 
may draw is another issue. But the second

Universities should snuff out anti-semitism
Palestinian children meat, slaughtered 
according to Jewish rites under American 
license” and signs proclaiming “Zionism = 
racism” and “Jews = Nazis.” This was nei­
ther civic discourse nor free speech, but a 
virulent attack on the Jewish community.
But SFSU is not alone in its hostility 
toward Jews. In April a number of Jewish 
students at the University of California at 
Berkeley reported being assaulted. A male j 
student wearing a Jewish ritual skullcap \ 
was severely beaten on campus. While | 
attending religious services at the universi- j 
ty Hillel, students and faculty were pelted 1 
with rotten eggs. Berkeley’s Hillel House 1 
has been defaced with graffiti numerous \ 
times and it is not uncommon to see expres-1 
sions like “Fuck Jews” scrawled on the 
house’s walls.
On the first day of classes this year, 
Harvard University President Lawrence 
Summers delivered a bold speech denounc-
New York Times ran an ad endorsed by 
more than 300 college presidents contain­
ing a controversial statement, condemning 
the intimidation of Jews and stating that it 
will no longer be tolerated on university 
campuses. The statement was a collective 
response by the American Jewish 
Committee and six former and current col­
lege presidents to a string of campus inci­
dents that had targeted Jewish students.
Last spring at San Francisco State 
University, a counter rally to the campus 
Hillel’s “Peace In The Middle East Rally” 
turned into a riot as Jewish students were 
verbally assailed. While these students and 
community supporters prayed and sang 
songs in support of peace in Israel, counter 
demonstrators screamed, “Get out or we 
will kill you” and “Hitler did not finish the 
job.” The rally was the culmination of anti- 
Semitic campus activity over the past year. 
SFSU is notorious for anti-Semitism and last 
year students were forced to walk daily past 
posters of cans of soup labeled “canned

We have all sat, or in some instances 
slept, through monotonous history lectures. 
It would be difficult to find a student who 
has never heard of the Holocaust or Russia’s 
infamous pogroms of the early 20th centu­
ry. Yet at the same time, it would be hard to 
find a student who truly dwells on these 
events. We learn about them, but at the end 
of the day we move on. What happened in 
the past stays in the past. Or does it? As time 
has shown, history has an irksome tendency 
of repeating itself, as the current anti- 
Semitic exploits and rhetoric demonstrate. 
Most disturbing of all is that anti-Semitism 
is closer to home than we may think.
Anti-Semitism is a reality. It is taking 
place on college campuses nationwide and 
its prevalence is growing. On October 7, The

major party candidates’ negative ads, a tac­
tic both promised they would not use at the 
beginning of the campaign. Why should any 
voter trust candidates to bring economic 
revitalization when their actions are an 
affront to ethical sensibilities?
It is widely believed that the state’s future 
prosperity depends upon the retention rates 
of Pennsylvania college graduates. However, 
the reactionary exclusion of third party voic­
es from gubernatorial debates goes against 
the progressive nature of the college demo­
graphic. By focusing on major party plat­
forms like racetrack gambling and public 
school funding, the Post-Gazette ignores a 
host of other campaign issues and alienates 
the state’s youngest voters. By silencing the 
progressive, and perhaps flamboyant, third 
party candidates, the newspaper fails to 
account for the youth interest of 
Pennsylvania.
Send a message to the media, to 
Pennsylvania, and the nation that we need 
some idealism to temper these stagnant 
political times.
Go to the polls and say, “I am voting for a 
third-party candidate because my vote will 
not be bought.”
Krawchuk once said that the US could 
fund its military with a bake sale. Ideas that 
go against the grain have effectively elimi­
nated him from future debates. If creativity 
is a reason to exclude a legitimate candidate 
from the American democratic process, it’s 
time to redefine America — with marijuana, 
environmentalism, or even home-baked 
brownies.
When major party candidates start bully­
ing third party candidates out of an election, 
we need to open our eyes. When the media 
facilitates the process, we need to open our 
mouths.
Pennsylvania’s November 5 gubernatorial 
election will go down as the most expensive 
campaign race in state history. Democratic 
Party candidate Ed Rendell has raised over 
$37 million, dwarfing Republican Mike 
Fisher’s $15 million budget. Even as he trails 
Rendell by over $20 million in campaign 
funding, Fisher’s budget is still larger than 
any other candidate’s in state history. It 
jseems that money does the talking.
Libertarian Party candidate Ken 
Krawchuk and Green Party candidate Mike 
Morrill have been railroaded out of several 
televised debates, including one sponsored 
by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and aired by 
WPXI-TV yesterday. In the last three debates 
before the election, pro-drug, pro-gun, and 
environmentalist views will be brushed 
aside in favor of Republican-Democrat ban­
tering. It’s like asking a horse to run two- 
legged down the final stretch.
Fisher has complained of Krawchuk’s 
antics at debates, criticizing him for illegally 
ripping up dollar bills to illustrate his feel­
ings on taxes. Yet as he dismisses 
Krawchuck’s credibility, Fisher engages in 
similar marketing ploys. Shamelessly 
appealing to the regional vote, Fisher aired a 
Pittsburgh-exclusive commercial saying the 
he prefers Primanti Brother’s sandwiches to 
Philadelphia cheese steaks.

It all began one day in history class. 
Through the crisp autumn air you could feel 
the gentle stirrings of controversy, creeping 
out of the ether, cohering around Baker 
Hall. It was the stuff of bedtime novels, real­
ly — the topic was set, and I in my cap, had 
just settled down to a long lecture’s nap. My 
attempt at a moment’s repose was broken, 
however, with the news that our class was 
to have a “special visitor” today. Her pur­
pose? Of course, to supplement our read­
ings and enrich past discussion topics with 
her expert knowledge on the subject we had 
so closely followed all these weeks, right 
Professor? No so, we soon found out. Our 
“special visitor” today was to lecture (and 
here I use the term as loosely as I would 
calling a stag film “sexual education”) on 
the benefits of joining the American 
Federation of Labor — Congress of 
Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) as bud­
ding union organizers. And furthermore, 
why we should recognize the greed that 
capitalism has wrought on these shores, 
why union representation is the last 
redoubt of the moral economy, an aegis 
against the Enron-ization of our country. 
The message was clear: it was a recruitment 
session and we the captive audience to this 
young woman’s proselytizing.
I use the above anecdote to illustrate a 
point, if somewhat bluntly. When colleges 
and universities are turned into handmaid­
ens for a certain political or ideological 
stance — and this process is passed off as 
pedagogy in our classrooms — educational 
purpose, objective decision-making and all, 
is lost. If Johnny Cochran were writing this 
column, I’m sure the famous defense attor­
ney would find a lull somewhere to declare, 
“If it sounds like agitprop, then the class 
must stop!” No student is served by indoc­
trination, however harmless its practition­
ers claim it to be. That professor of mine, 
lovely woman she otherwise is, made a mis­
take; I aim to call her on it because I believe 
the central role of any seat of higher learn­
ing should be to produce educated, critical, 
and open minds — the sort of thinker who
claims opinions based upon analysis of 
facts, not professorial pressure. While I fail 
to see this great liberal conspiracy of ideo­
logical deprivation on our nation’s campus­
es that so many of today’s conservative talk­
ing heads rant about daily — David 
Horowitz, are you listening? — I can agree 
with at least some of their accusations. 
True, with Horowitz and his bunch it is a 
witch hunt; but, that doesn’t mean there 
aren’t any witches. Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents of every stripe and predilection must 
stay vigilant to recognize institutional 
abuse where it exists and expose it for the 
corruption of academic values it represents.
A word about Horowitz: he has made a 
not insignificant profit (career?) from his 
daily brickbats on the web site he founded, 
FrontPageMagazine.com. He confronts the 
institutional biases of our “liberal” colleges 
and national universities, yes, and chal­
lenges the sanctimony of anti-papist, anti­
minority vocational schools like Bob Jones 
University, but his position is ultimately 
hypocritical to the small-government con­
servatism he espouses on Front Page. His 
argument is circular. Horowitz sees no 
other recourse but to enlist the government 
in the quest to make schools safe for stu­
dents. This is a job for the EEOC! The 
Commission on Civil Rights must hear of 
this outrage! Addressing the lack of diversi­
ty in administrative voices by going through 
the federal government would do little to 
alleviate student body headaches, and 
should be anathema to a person who ranks 
affirmative action somewhere behind 
smallpox as one of the great infectious dan­
gers of the 21st century.
My approach, in its application, is hope­
fully less loaded than Horowitz’s, and nary
a federal inspector will be found. It involves 
confrontation...and discussion.
To wit, my encounter with professor of 
Rhetoric, Linda Flower. It came to my atten­
tion through an email (is there any other 
way?) while I was working on this piece, 
that Flower had disseminated an email to 
the English department, students and teach­
ers alike, calling on them to “[gather] signa­
tures in an effort to avoid a tragic world 
event.” The event, of course, is the potential 
war with Iraq. The mailing, again sent to all 
those on the English email list, further; 
requested a signature on the e-petition1 
which was to be sent off to the United 
Nations in a show of solidarity against “what 
may be the beginning of a THIRD WORLD. 
WAR.” In a subsequent forward, Flower) 
encouraged colleagues and students to call j 
the office of Pennsylvania Senator Arlen ' 
Specter if they opposed pre-emptive action 
against Iraq. I questioned Flower as to the 
professionalism of these actions and their 
ethical sturdiness. She told me the emails 
had been a mistake; she intended that the, 
forwards reach fellow English professors 
and grad students, not every member of the 
list. When pressed, Flower emphasized the 
“deliberative process” and a “need for open-, 
ness” towards the hot-button issues of the; 
day. I was (and still am) suspicious of this 
“deliberative process” when it is guided' 
overwhelmingly by one set of voices. If “sun-! 
light is the best disinfectant,” as Justice; 
Louis D. Brandeis took it to be, then we as; 
students should spare no effort to let every» 
last ray of public scrutiny shine in.

Unilateralism 
preserves US’s 
interestsfffffff
~pv(rL—-*"¦ Timothy Lo
The United States is once again at odds with the 
world, and this time even with our friends across 
the Atlantic. The notion of multilateral agree­
ments and an international law is growing in pop­
ularity as our world becomes smaller and nations 
more interactive. But just as we chose to forego 
environmental, racial, and world trade treaties at 
Kyoto, Durban, and Seattle, we are again passing 
on the utopian idea of a new world order by 
threatening to go it alone in our campaign to rid 
Iraq of Saddam Hussein, drawing criticism from 
just about every nation in the world. Once again, 
the United States is labeled a racist, insensitive, 
and hegemonic bully.
Multilateral agreements like those made at the 
United Nations are fundamentally dangerous and 
ineffective because they remove responsibility and 
accountability and instill unchecked powers. The 
United Nations General Assembly operates on the 
principle of “one government, one vote” — disre­
garding size, culture, population, technological 
advancement, and responsibility of individual 
states. This egalitarian distribution of power from 
the haves to the have-nots would in fact mean less 
democracy, for there is no way to hold those who 
are making decisions accountable to those they 
represent, as in national democracies. In addition, 
multilateral decision making increases the cultural 
and political distance between those making the 
decisions and those who are affected by them.
This relationship cannot produce the same type of 
solidarity as experienced by those who share a 
similar cultural background. The result is apathy 
at best and deadlock at worst, yielding an organi­
zation where the good have to compromise with 
the bad and representatives from murderous 
regimes like China, Libya, and Sudan end up dic­
tating policies of human rights all in the name of 
democracy — a system unfamiliar to the very peo­
ple they represent.
( The United Nations demonstrated one of its
weaknesses in the Bosnian conflict. The UN makes 
it its business to intervene in other people’s wars, 
often aiding more death and destruction. The first 
i priority of UN peacekeepers is to avoid casualties 
among their own personnel, often appeasing the 
locally stronger force by accepting its dictates and 
tolerating its abuses. UN forces are at best passive 
spectators. During the 1992-94 siege of Sarajevo, 
appeasement interacted with the pretense of pro­
tection in an especially perverse manner: UN per­
sonnel inspected outgoing flights to prevent the 
escape of Sarajevo civilians in accordance with a 
cease-fire agreement negotiated with the locally 
dominant Serbs, who themselves violated that 
deal. The result was the death of hundreds of 
Bosnians. The more sensible and realistic response 
to a raging war would have been for the Muslims 
to either flee the city or drive the Serbs out.
President Bush pointed out the follies of the 
United Nations when he addressed the General 
Assembly in September. By presenting the case 
against Hussein as. a story of unmitigated defiance 
by Iraq, and not of the US towards the UN, Bush 
put America in the position of being above 
reproach by the international community. No 
longer can the world say that it is the US that is 
defying international law by waging war, but 
rather it is Iraq that is defying international law by 
thumbing its nose at the Security Council 
Resolutions. For it was the UN that demanded 
Saddam’s compliance with a list of 16 UN resolu­
tions and it is Saddam Hussein who has ignored 
every one of them. These resolutions were 
“mandatory.” The world says that the US is defy­
ing the UN by going it alone, but in reality it is the 
UN that is defying itself. The US does not want to 
do the work of the UN, but if this institution won’t 
stand up for the very standards and ideals it set 
out for itself, then the US will. The demands and 
resolutions made by the UN are nothing more 
than cowardly statements backed up with empty 
threats.
In the end, the United Nations will join the 
League of Nations in the dustbin of history and its 
pretty headquarters will be nothing more than an 
empty office building for rent along New York’s 
East River.

Universities should watch for anti-Semitic rhetoric
ANTI-SEMITISM, from page A9
ing recent instances of anti-Semitism in the 
United States and abroad. Addressing an 
audience gathered for traditional morning 
prayers at Memorial Church, Summers point­
ed out that anti-Semitism and anti-Israel 
views, once the “primary preserve of poorly 
educated right-wing populists” were 
“increasingly finding support in progressive 
intellectual communities” — even on ivy-cov­
ered campuses.
Summers spoke out in part because peti­
tions had been circulating around Harvard’s 
campus demanding that the university with­
draw all of'its investments from Israel, a 
demand that has also taken root at about 40 
other US universities. Summers has been crit­
icized for misunderstanding the difference 
between being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic. 
Anti-Semitism has many faces and legitimate 
criticism of Israel is certainly not anti- 
Semitic. However, the rhetoric of petitioners
at Harvard who single out Israel sounds sus­
piciously anti-Semitic. Israel among all 
nations is being alienated as a country where 
it is unfitting for Harvard’s endowment to be 
invested. “Serious and thoughtful people,” 
said Summers, “are advocating and taking 
actions that are anti-Semitic in their effect if 
not their intent.”
Summers is not the only one stressing the 
escalation of anti-Semitism on college cam­
puses. On September 18, the day after 
Summers delivered his speech, Daniel Pipes 
launched a controversial website (campus- 
watch.org) to monitor what he calls “anti- 
Semitism in Middle Eastern Studies programs 
on campuses.” Pipes, director of the Middle 
East Forum, has been criticized for promoting 
“McCarthyism” and suppressing academic 
freedom with Campus-Watch. However, it is 
not Pipes, but campus Israel-bashers, who are 
suppressing academic freedom for Jewish 
students. Campus-Watch is merely exposing 
fiendish campus activity to a wider audience
and allowing university donors and taxpayers 
to properly evaluate it. Pipes has been sched­
uled to speak at the Carnegie Lecture Hall on 
November 4.
The critics may claim what they want, but 
facts cannot be denied. Anti-Semitism is 
guilefully spreading across intellectual com­
munities similar to Carnegie Mellon. Sure, 
minor incidents on Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
such as the penciling in of slanderous terms 
on Hillel’s posters have not made national 
news. But if anti-Semitism is not challenged, 
who is to say that more serious events will not 
occur in the future? Witnessing bias against 
Jewish students and doing nothing is not 
challenging anti-Semitism, it is simply cow­
ardly behavior. Speaking out against discrim­
ination and holding the guilty accountable is 
anti-Semitism’s only chance of being annihi­
lated.

That’s it. I’m done. And before you start 
crying or cheering or continuing not to care, 
please allow me to explain.
I’ve been running this- column for three 
years. In the process, I’ve gotten myself pub­
lished scores of times, toyed with a lot of people 
in an effort to point out that the world has 
indeed lost its sense of humor, and even man­
aged to make a few solid points here and there 
whenever I managed to concern myself more 
with what I was saying than how I was saying it.
As it stands, this is my 65th and last col­
umn. At an average of 1700 words a pop (pre­
censorship), that brings my grand total to 
around 110,500 words. Damn, it feels good to 
say that. It goes without saying that I had fun. 
Along the way, I’ve been lucky enough to 
meet almost as many great young minds as I 
have ruthlessly self-involved assholes. And 
that, if nothing else, rekindles a bit of hope in 
my generation and its boundless potential.
But to be brutally honest, I’ve just grown 
tired of writing this thing, and I refuse to keep 
going out of what seems to have become, for 
lack of a better description, obligation. What 
was once a thrilling and empowering process 
has become a chore that garners more trouble 
than I care to deal with. I’m tired of failing 
miserably in my attempt to get people to light­
en up and look at things in a new way.
Most of all, I think I’m tired of people blind­
ly judging me by what I put in here. Yes, these 
are my words. Yes, I stand behind them. Yes, 
I’d be an idiot to assume this culpability 
wouldn’t be part of it all. But what nobody 
ever understood is that these opinions do not 
define me. They’re a chronicle of what I hap­
pened to be thinking for a certain period of 
time on a certain day under the influence of 
God knows what. Whether or not I embraced 
that opinion an hour, a month, or a year later 
is as uncertain and random as the topics I’ve 
covered. It’s not that these beliefs weren’t 
strong. It’s just that I think any person who 
refuses to reconsider and edit a viewpoint a 
fool. After all, a belief is only as strong as the 
scrutiny it endures, and anybody who never 
calls into question their stance on anything in 
order to examine their world is as good as 
dead. And this continuing desire on the part 
of the public to label me by my rants is no 
longer something I care to deal with.
I think it all came to a head a few weeks ago 
when, after writing a two-parter on marijua­
na legalization, I received four separate 
phone calls from people looking for weed. I 
think it made me realize that no matter what 
I say or how I say it, or who reads it, the real 
message is lost. All I ever asked was that every 
single person who read this sh*t stopped and 
thought about life slightly differently, even if 
only for a few minutes before deciding either 
that I might very well be onto something, or 
that my head was planted firmly up my ass. 
What if our University focused on individual 
intellectual exercise and development instead 
of its endowment? What if we had a student
government we could trust to make the 
changes we so desperately need and deserve? 
What if our politicians were heroes instead of 
crooked businessmen? What if certain admin­
istrators who shall remain nameless really are 
into kinky sex with small children?
At least I never ran out of sh*t to say. 
Hopefully, I never will. Over these three 
years, I’ve tackled politics, philosophy, art, 
music, women, activism, censorship, sports, 
Pitt, war, literature, booze, drugs, cigarettes, 
the marvelously difficult experience that is 
college, and my perpetual favorite, CMU, just 
to throw out a short list.
I’m going to miss picking on this place. If 
not for our esteemed university, I don’t think 
this whole deal would’ve gone on for half as 
long as it did. But I do need to clarify one 
thing: I don’t hate CMU. I certainly have 
reservations about the way this joint is run. I 
think that it’s plagued by an undeniable fixa­
tion on making money; by a tendency to put 
the political and financial statuses of its high­
er-ups before the well-being of what should 
be an incense focus on expanding young 
minds to the point of bursting at the seams; 
and by a general disregard for its students’ 
personal well-being.
But I love it just the same. Where else in the 
world are you going to find ludicrously stupid 
and self-deprecating traditions like sitting 
outside in the middle of a Pittsburgh winter 
just so you can express yourself by tagging a 
concrete fence? Where else do students get up 
before dawn every Saturday and Sunday 
morning to chase a fiberglass phallus around 
a city park? Where else is there a Lobster Boy, 
or 3D porn in the campus movie theatre, or a 
$3.50 styrofoam container full of Indian food 
served by a lovable mustached guy named 
Sree? I love this place. And I believe that 
because of this love I feel the need to criticize 
it perpetually. That, and I’m endlessly haunt­
ed by the vision of how great it could be if 
only we were a little less serious and a little 
more passionately open-minded. I’ve 
watched friend after friend leave this college 
for reasons ranging from substance abuse to a 
lackadaisical work ethic to the most frequent
culprit — money. The only thing their depar­
tures had in common was the fact that almost 
all of them could’ve been prevented.
That’s why, as much as I can’t stand the 
thought of being overseen by someone like 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Murphy, I 
still have to appreciate his existence. After all, 
you’re only as good as your enemies force you 
to be. And while I think that, professionally, 
good ol’ Murph and his cronies up there in 
Warner are generally a lot of money-hungry 
egomaniacs with little to no real sympathy for 
the better part of their student body, I’m sure 
that when they leave the office, I’d have no 
problem sitting down for a beer and talking 
about anything that didn’t involve this 
cesspool. It’s unfortunate that fate pitted us 
against each other, but so be it. I think these 
jackasses run their school poorly and I think it 
my place to let them know about it over and 
over and over again until they get the mes­
sage. And I think they have. I just don’t think 
they have any interest in changing, as it’d 
involve pay cuts and empathy. But I suppose 
that’s their job. And they do it well.
Back to the point. I know that I’ve got other 
things that demand my attention. I’ve got an 
honor’s thesis to write, a novel to finish, two 
science credits to pass, another newspaper to 
write for, a job to find/grad school to hide in, 
a football and hockey team to follow reli­
giously, and some fun to have without worry­
ing over what to write about, how to top 
myself, and whether or not it’ll be worth the 
trouble I’ll inevitably get myself into.
I should really put this thing to bed before 
this creeping reluctance gets the better of me. 
There are too many people to thank and too 
little time in which to do so. In short, I’d like 
to let the following entities know that they are 
appreciated: my fans, critics, professors, 
administrators, editors, parents, intervie­
wees, sources, friends, enemies, odd allies, 
opponents, liquor, nicotine, inspirations, 
rage, doubts, victories, failures, and lastly, my 
university. So long, kids. It’s been amusing.

THE TARTAN • OCTOBER 28, 2002
For now, NFL returns to normal state
nROAN (ROOR4H)
Finally things are beginning to 
return to order in the NFL. God has 
decided to fool around with college 
football for the time being, which 
allows for the NFL to right itself 
after a shaky beginning. The Rams 
are winning, the Dolphins are blow­
ing big games, and the Panthers 
have reminded us that they still 
suck. No one is happier about this 
return to expectations then our very 
own Pittsburgh Steelers. After six 
weeks of crying in their Yuengling, 
fans in the Iron City have finally 
found something to cheer about.
The terrible towel reigned supreme 
last Monday night as the Black and 
Gold gave the overrated Colts a 
whooping on both sides of the ball.
So come friends, share a drink 
with me in honor of what looks to 
be a good year for the home team. 
Those of you from Pittsburgh, those 
of you who have grown to love it, 
and those of you who have been 
chained to it for the last three years 
and can stomach it, raise your glass­
es high. The team has everything 
going for it, and a playoff run is 
developing.
Here are my top ten reasons why 
we will watch our beloved Stillers 
over Christmas Break.
10) The Original Hot Dog Shop. 
You ever wonder what fuels the 
Bus? How about where the grease 
for the Steel Curtain comes from? 
That’s right: the ‘O.’ Combined with 
Primanti Brothers, these fine estab­
lishments have revved up the 
machine that is the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. There is no stopping them
now, they got fry power.
9) Pittsburgh weather. Man, does 
it suck. This favors a strong running 
game, which the Steelers have. The 
more it rains and snows the more 
teams have to run the ball. The 
defense can stop the run, and 
opposing teams have trouble con­
taining the Steeler running attack.
8)Antwaan Randle-El. Have you 
ever seen this kid play? He is going 
to be a star in this league, and will 
be the X-Factor in more than one 
game this year.
7) California. By having two 
teams in the World Series this year 
the state of California has sucked up 
all the luck the West has. This elimi­
nates Oakland, San Diego, and 
Denver, all three of which could 
cause the Steelers problems in the 
playoffs.
6) Rally Rhesus. Courtesy of the 
good folks at the Center for the 
Neural Basis of Cognition right here 
at CMU, a genetically enhanced rhe­
sus monkey will don Steeler apparel 
and hop up and down to make the 
team win. Occasionally Bill Cowher 
will call for the tiny star to come in 
and kick field goals.
5) Me. I’m good luck.
4) Christina Aguilera. Pittsburgh’s 
own sexy singer will stop pretend­
ing to be ghetto fabulous and slip 
back into that yinzer accent we all 
know she has. For some reason this 
will inspire the Steelers to play bet­
ter. Lose some of that make-up and 
this girl could inspire me to do an 
awful lot.
3) Hardcore Tartan fans. Tartan 
cheerleaders will distract the other 
teams by doing that really cool 
thing with their pom-poms that
spells C-M-U. Then some skinny 
white kids will take off their shirts 
and paint Carnegie Tech on their 
ribcage of a chest and scare the hell 
out of what opponents managed to 
ignore the girls.
2) Tommy Maddox. While I won’t 
go so far as to say he was blessing, 
he is definitely an upgrade at quar­
terback. Kordell didn’t have it this 
year, and Maddox has the vision, 
the accuracy, and the confidence to 
lead this team deep into the post­
season.
1) AFC North. Dear God this divi­
sion is awful. From the Ravens to 
the Bungles it is clear that the good 
Lord loves Pittsburgh. Look at 
Cleveland! How can anything good 
come of that? The Mistake by the ’ 
Lake has doomed the Brownies to 
failure. I say give these people more 
beer; it is the only thing preventing 
the lunch-box wearing a dog mask 
in the front row from breaking 
down and bawling. The Ravens still 
can’t score, and they have to cross 
the goal line if they are going to 
contend, especially with Ray-Dog 
barking from the sidelines. The 
Bengals just suck. I’d be surprised if 
they won a single game.
So there you have it folks, some­
thing to look forward to. Despite 
the weather, things are brightening 
up here in the ’Burgh. By the time 
late December rolls around people 
here will forget what the sun looks 
like, Mario will be hurt, and finals 
will have kicked our asses, but at 
least we’ll have the Steelers.
Colin Holloway (colinh) will feel 
like an idiot if the Ravens have won 
by the time you read this.

CMU performs at 
Gettysburg Invit.
On Saturday, October 19, the cross 
country team ran in the Gettysburg 
Invitational. The men’s team fin­
ished second with a score of 78, 
while the women’s team finished 
fourth with a score of 130.
The men’s team was led by a fifth- 
place (26:39.71) finish by first-year 
Dana Irrer, who won the Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational Tournament on 
October 12. Junior Mike End fin­
ished eighth with a time of 26:52.08. 
Senior Mike Rossi and junior Alex 
Weiss finished eighteenth and twen- 
ty-first, respectively.
The team finished behind 
Wheeling Jesuit Universiy, who had 
64 points.
The women’s team was led by 
senior Katie Aerni, who finished 
fourth in the race with a time of 
19:34.04. Sophomore Nicole
Gartner finished fifteenth with a 
time of 20:11.12, and first-year 
Andrea Garvue finished nineteenth 
with 20:17.05.
The cross country teams go to 
New York University next week for 
the UAA championships.
Crew competes in 
Schuylkill regatta
The crew team competed in the 
Head of the Schuylkill regatta on 
Saturday, held on the Schuylkill 
River in Philadelphia. The event is 
the largest single-day regatta in the 
US, with over 1,200 racing boats.
The team’s best results were in the 
men’s heavyweight 8+, which came 
in fifth out of 34 teams with a time of 
13:42.78. Women’s heavyweight 
finished 12 out of 34; men’s light­
weight 8+ finished 6 of 10; men’s 
novice 8+ finished 38 of 49; 
women’s novice 8+ finished 37 of 
50; men’s heavyweight 4+ finished 
24 of 25; and women’s heavyweight 
4+ finished 21 of 25.
Race difficulties arose from the 
winds causing rough water condi­
tions, and the fact that races were 
run up river, forcing competitors to 
row against the current.
The Head of Schuylkill regatta 
was the first opportunity for novice 
crews to compete this season, and 
represented the most competitive 
race all year for all crews, according 
to senior rower Mark Wyszomierski.
Last weekend, the team also sent a 
women’s open 8+ to Boston’s Head 
of Charles regatta, the most presti­
gious regatta in the world. Carnegie

Tartan swimmers dominated Grove City on Saturday. The men won 135-96 and the women won 109-77.

“My time was about where I was 
last year,” said Pearson. “I was a little 
bit slower against Franklin and 
Marshall, but I got myself back up to 
the point where I can qualify for 
Nationals.”
On the women’s team, junior Julie 
Tibor won the 100-yard freestyle 
(55.39) and the 50-yard freestyle 
(25.55), building off the first meet 
against Franklin and Marshall, in
which she won the same two events. 
Jenn Wong continued her winning 
ways by winning the 500-yard 
freestyle (5:25.15), and sophomore 
Emily Evans won the 200-yard back­
stroke (2:15.66).
Continuing their success last year, 
both teams started well on October 
19, when the men defeated Franklin 
and Marshall 151-95 and the women 
won 132-129. The men were led by 
Pearson, who won the 1,000-yard 
freestyle, the 200-yard butterfly, and
the 100-yard freestyle.
Brian McCarthy won the UAA 
swimmer of the week award by win­
ning the 200-yard backstroke, 
anchoring the first place 200-yard 
medley relay team, and scoring a 
nationals qualifying time on the 100- 
yard backstroke.
“After last season, we expected 
ourselves to get off to this really good 
start,” said Pearson. “We didn’t lose 
many seniors and we have a strong 
group of freshman to add to the mix.”

about going into a play when I know 
that the team really needs those two 
or three yards.”
For the Engineers, senior QB Jared 
Tharpe was able to find his receivers 
regularly, racking up 285 yards 
through the air on 28-for-47 passing. 
Wideout Rob Kief came through with 
10 receptions for 87 yards for Rose- 
Hulman, burning several Tartan 
defensive backs in what has become, 
with some exceptions, a familiar 
theme on the year. Fortunately, the
rest of Carnegie Mellon’s defense was 
able to hold the Engineer’s running 
game at bay for the whole game, lim­
iting possession time to 23:28 and 
forcing the Rose-Hulman offense into 
tight spots. Additionally, the sus­
tained case of fumble-itis plaguing 
CMU football this season — four 
flubs for three turnovers in last 
Saturday’s contest — was negated by 
the explosive offensive output. With 
things seemingly coming together for 
the Tartans despite a rash of injuries 
that has also claimed fullback Adam 
Urbanczyk, personnel such as offen-
sive coordinator and running backs 
coach Rich Erdelyi had reason for 
optimism in upcoming games, 
including UAA contests against 
Chicago and Washington the next 
two weeks.
“We’re patchworking our offense 
right now because of the injuries,” he 
said. “Our offense should be fine if 
the offensive line continues to keep it 
up. They’re an experienced group 
and I don’t see why they shouldn’t. As 
long as we eliminate our mistakes, 
turnovers, and penalties, we’ll do 
fine.”

Though NYU exhibited speed and 
strong play, the Violets did not score 
on CMU first-year goalkeeper Betsy 
Ricker in the first half.
Ricker, starting both games this 
weekend, made a number of impres­
sive saves in the game, but even those 
were not enough. One punch-save 
toward New York midfielder Natalie 
Shaheen fed back over Ricker’s head 
provided the game winning point for 
the Violets.
Tartan junior Anne Talarico 
crossed a corner kick from Yaghoubi 
back in front of the goal. She also 
missed an opportunity as NYU goal­
keeper Becca Giefer ran to stop an 
advancing Tartan and barely slid into 
the ball before she got off a shot. The
game ended 1-0, and NYU clinched 
the UAA title with the victory.
Earlier in the week, Carnegie 
Mellon hosted Frostburg State (MD) 
University (8-7-4). Two minutes into 
the game, the Bobcats nearly scored 
on their own goal, but turned it 
around scoring the game’s lone goal 
in only the third minute of play. 
While the Tartans out shot Frostburg 
19-3 in the game, including impres­
sive shots near the end of each half by 
Dumont and Yaghoubi, Bobcat goalie 
Stephanie Zych managed to stop 
them all.
The women’s soccer team finishes 
the regular season this week playing 
La Roche College (14-2-2) on 
Tuesday and their final UAA game 
hosting Case Western (11-5-1,1-5-0 
in the UAA) on Sunday.

Pompeani scoring four of the 
team’s 12 aces. CMU’s team 
defense was also strong, and the 
104 Tartan digs in the match were 
well above the season average and 
more than a third of the total for 
the entire weekend.
“Gettysburg was the toughest 
team we played, but we kept hang­
ing in there until we got the kill,” 
said Webb.
Saturday’s matches were not 
nearly as competitive, as the 
Tartans pounded an overmatched 
Muhlenberg (13-20, 0-4) squad 
and had only slightly more difficul­
ty with Allegheny (11-18, 1-3). 
Schmidt played particularly well 
against Allegheny, scoring on 55 
percent of her kill attempts. Casella 
added eight aces in the match, giv­
ing her 15 for the tournament, a 
career high for a single weekend.
“When I get angry at the other 
team, I serve better,” said Casella, 
who has a stinging jump-serve. 
“Sitting on the bench, I was think­
ing of things that made me mad, 
and I went in and served two aces, 
so I’ll do that from now on.”
Webb singled out Casella’s per­
formance for more than just her 
serves. “Christina had some 
momentum-changing digs for us. I 
haven’t seen her dig this well her 
entire career,” she said.
Bartek’s 41 percent success rate 
on kills against Muhlenberg was 
just one of the strong performances 
from the three Tartan first-years 
who all received extended playing 
time over the weekend. “All of the 
freshmen did well,” said Webb.
Schmidt, who recorded her 
2000th career kill over the week­
end, was pleased with the team’s 
performance, but noted that there 
is still room for improvement.
“As a team we served well.... Our 
blocking needs work, but it was 
better for us today,” she said. 
“There were a couple small parts 
where we broke down for a few 
points.”
Casella was equally critical of the 
team’s performance. “We didn’t 
stomp on them the way we thought 
we should have,” she said.
The Tartans’ occasional lack of 
focus was also a concern for Webb. 
“We dictated the pace of play, 
except for when we went into a 
couple of funks here and there,” 
she said.
Webb also pointed out some 
areas where the Tartans will have 
to improve before the UAA 
Championships November 8-9. 
“We need to establish our middle 
attack,” she said. “We have to run it 
more confidently and aggressive­
ly.”
The Tartans will take on Buffalo 
State (22-9) and have a rematch 
with Allegheny on November 2 at 
Allegheny.

Another week, another reversal of 
fortunes for the Carnegie Mellon 
football team. Coming off a demoral­
izing and error-plagued loss to Case 
Western Reserve last weekend, the 
Tartans (4-3) bounced back in Terre 
Haute, Indiana, to defeat the Rose- 
Hulman Institute of Technology 
Engineers (3-5) 27-17 and regain a 
measure of confidence lost in the 
wake of a last minute heartbreaker to 
Case Western Reserve. With any luck, 
this roller-coaster season for CMU 
football has come to a halt.
Once again, where the rushing 
attack excelled, so followed the 
Tartans. The team ran for 305 yards 
on 75 attempts, eclipsing that of the 
Engineers’ paltry 82 yards in compar­
ison. Sophomore fullback Brad 
Stanley led Carnegie Mellon with 119 
yards on the ground and one score. 
His counterpart, Andrew Garrod, 
added 50 yards rushing and one 
touchdown. The senior running back 
also added a 90-yard kickoff return 
with 6:23 remaining in the first quar­
ter, bringing the Tartan sideline to its 
feet as Garrod stealthily eluded 
defenders and galloped into the end- 
zone. Stanley, seeing more playing 
time with the unfortunate high ham­
string injury to productive RB 
Ricardo Clarke, praised his offensive 
line.
“The O-line played great. They did 
a great job of blocking, making holes 
and allowing me to punch through 
the line of scrimmage,” said Stanley. 
“They made it very easy for me to 
make my reads and see the field.” The 
ability of the Tartan offensive line to 
push the Engineer defense off the line 
of scrimmage was especially instru­
mental in Stanley’s touchdown off a 
one-yard run late in the game’s third 
quarter. The score, a pounding rush 
into the Rose-Hulman endzone, put 
Carnegie Mellon up 24-9 and placed 
a comeback surge just out of reach for 
the Engineers, now down two touch­
downs and a two-point conversion.
“I feel that short yardage situations 
are my specialty,” said Stanley about 
his score. “I’m always comfortable

the women’s team won 109-77, but 
neither match was as close as the 
score indicates, as many of the CMU 
swimmers swam exhibition towards 
the end.
The relay teams set the tone for the 
meet, as both A teams won the 400- 
yard medley relay. After that, the 
men’s team finished first in every 
event until they started swimming 
exhibition from the 200-yard back­
stroke on in order not to run up the 
score. The women’s team faced 
tougher competition, with junior 
Peggy Whitbeck of Grove City win­
ning the 200-yard butterfly and the 
200-yard freestyle, but still managed 
to build a decisive lead.
“This is a good start for the team,” 
said head coach David Belowich. 
“We’re showing a good combination 
of speed and experience early on.”
The men’s team had many strong 
performers and were led by sopho­
more Chris Pearson and junior Brian 
Jucha. Pearson won the 200-yard 
freestyle (1:44.23) and the 200-yard 
butterfly (1:54.11), while Jucha won 
the 100-yard freestyle (47.34) and 
finished second behind Pearson in 
the 200-yard freestyle (1:48.68).
Pearson’s time in the butterfly was 
fast enough to qualify him for a possi­
ble spot in the NCAA Division III 
championships if he finishes in the 
top 20 at the end of the year. Junior 
Steve Clifford also turned in a strong 
performance, winning the 1,000-yard 
freestyle (10:16.78). Bobby Colyer 
added a win in the 200-yard IM 
(2:00.60), and Evan Powell won the 
50-yard freestyle (21.99).

UAA Champs: three in a row!
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
The Tartan men continued their dominant, unbeaten, 
and tie-less season this week, adding games against 
Grove City, Emory, and NYU to their win column. In the 
process, they secured their third-straight NCAA tourna­
ment bid and captured sole possession of the UAA title — 
also their third in a row.
The Tartans’ unbeaten 14-0-0 record is a first for 22- 
year veteran coach Nick Gaudioso, who cited previous 
near-perfect seasons when asked about his impressions 
of the streak. The team remains nationally unranked 
despite being the only team regionally ranked (of 80) 
with out a blemish in their record.
The first game had Emory University (8-6-1,1-3-1 in 
the UAA) visiting on Friday night after the evening’s rain 
had slowed. Neither goalkeeper had a save in the 4-2 
game and the only official shots were the goals. Emory 
started the scoring early with junior Matthew Levine 
knocking a ball out of the reach of the Tartans’ sopho­
more keeper Dave Thomas. Six minutes later, behind, 
but not discouraged, Carnegie Mellon scored twice in 
one minute.
The Tartans wasted no time starting the scoring in the 
second half, with first-year midfielder Dan Mastalski 
feeding the ball to senior midfielder Adam Hibshman, 
who scored from a short distance. Emory followed suit 
and narrowed the gap five minutes later when sopho­
more Kevin McCarthy headed a ball over Thomas.
Defender Mark Painter added the final insurance goal 
for the Tartans with 13 minutes to play. The win gave the 
team an automatic bid into the NCAA postseason tour­
nament.
The Sunday game pitted the team against the New 
York University Violets (10-6-1, 2-4-0 in the UAA), and 
the Tartans looked to win the UAA title outright. Their 
convincing 2-0 victory gave them the conference title 
and increased their chances of a top postseason seed. 
The Tartans scored both their goals in the first half.
With the Tartans dominating the first several minutes 
of play, the team started a volley between themselves 
and NYU goalkeeper Adam Colunga, which ended when 
he couldn’t field a shot from sophomore Tartan defender 
Alex Beck.
While Carnegie Mellon continued to dominate, they 
could not add to their score before an NYU foul kick 
cleared the crossbar over Thomas’ head by inches. The
Women’s soccer 
splits UAA games
game slowed and the Tartans refused to allow another 
close call. With a minute left in the period, senior for­
ward James Chung tapped a ball over Colunga while he 
was on the ground after a dive to make the score 2-0.
A 2-0 lead would be more than enough to win the 
game — and clinch the UAA title.
Earlier in the week, the team beat regional rival Grove 
City (3-11-2) 2-0 on a pair of Adam Hibshman goals in 
the first half.
With the UAA championship in their collective pocket, 
and their improved perfect record, the Tartans’ coach 
commented on his expectation for the upcoming playoffs 
after last year’s second-round exit against Messiah 
College. “It’s the playoffs,” Gaudioso said, “Anything can 
happen.”
The Tartan men hope to finish their regular season 
with a pair of wins against Washington and Jefferson 
College (8-7-1) on Thursday and against weak UAA 
rival Case Western Reserve (2-13-0, 0-6-0 in the UAA) 
on Saturday. The NCAA tournament begins on 
November 22.

Last weekend’s Carnegie Mellon 
Tournament was the last chance for 
the volleyball team’s five seniors to 
play in front of the home crowd, and 
they took full advantage of the 
opportunity.
Led by senior outside hitter 
Lauren Schmidt and senior defen­
sive specialist Christina Casella, the 
Tartans swept through the opposi­
tion, dropping only one game in 
four best-of-five matches. “The team 
played really well,” head coach Julie 
Webb said. “We played better than 
we have played in a while.”
The Tartans opened the weekend 
Friday afternoon against Lycoming 
College (16-10, 2-2 on the week­
end). The Warriors jumped out to an 
early lead, but first-year middle hit­
ter Chrissy Bartek scored several 
strong kills to give CMU their first 
lead of the game at 11-10. The 
Tartans dominated the match from 
then on, winning 3-1.
“It seemed like we were just the 
better team,” said assistant coach 
Mark Mediate. “[Lycoming] was 
making a lot of mistakes.”
The Tartans finished with 12 aces 
in the match, led by junior outside 
hitter Laura Graf, who had four.
Sophomore middle hitter Lisa 
Seacat also played a strong game, 
connecting on half of her kill 
attempts.
CMU faced their toughest test of 
the weekend in the evening game 
against Gettysburg College (18-12, 
3-1). Perhaps feeling the effects of 
having little rest between matches, 
the Bullets were sloppy from the 
outset, providing little challenge in 
the opening game of the match.
The second game was the first test 
for the Tartans, as seemingly all of 
their kill attempts found the out­
stretched arm of a Gettysburg 
defender. CMU matched Gettysburg 
dig for dig for most of the game, but 
after a miscommunication that put 
the Tartans down two points late, 
the Bullets held on for the win.
Game three was another dog­
fight, with neither team able to open 
up a large lead. The Tartans got a 
break when Gettysburg appeared to 
have tied the game at 28, but the 
point was awarded to CMU for a net 
violation. An ace on the next serve 
closed out the game, and the 
Tartans rode their momentum to an 
easy win in game four, taking the 
match 3-1.

Women’s soccer (9-4-2, 1-3-2 in the UAA) 
began this week winless in conference games 
and at the bottom of the UAA standings, but 
split a pair of 1-0 decisions against association 
leaders Emory and NYU this weekend to climb 
out of last place in the UAA. Emory and NYU 
were ranked 15th and 17th in the nation, 
respectively, coming into the weekend.
The Tartans’ game against Emory (11-3-1, 
4-2-0 in the UAA) was the their first confer­
ence victory of the season. Played in Friday 
night’s deluge, the game featured few scoring 
chances for either team. Emory had only one 
shot the entire game while Carnegie Mellon 
placed five shots on goal.
The first half featured a number of missed 
opportunities; most notably two missed 
rebound shots off the foot of junior midfielder 
Merry McConnochie and off the head of first- 
year forward Kristin Bevilaqua-Linn. The game 
was, however, still scoreless at halftime, and 
remained so well into the second half.
With 12 minutes to go in the game, first-year 
forward Hallie Dumont played the ball off the 
right post and into the net. The unassisted goal 
was the only score of the game and the remain­
ing minutes ticked away toward the biggest 
win of the team’s season.
The fact that four shots and the teams’ only 
goal came from first-year players supports 
head coach Heather Kendra’s opinion on the 
quality of this year’s team.
“The ability of the 2002 team is better than 
2001,” she said, despite the drop in record from 
last season’s 13-5-1.
The next game, played Sunday morning, was 
against the NYU Violets (10-3-3, 5-0-1 in the 
UAA) currently atop the UAA standings.
See SOCCER, page A13
And so ends the most boring seven-game 
World Series imaginable. No offense to any 
Angels or Giants fans who might be reading 
this, but I can’t think of a World Series I cared 
less about since the Blue Jays beat the Phillies 
in ’93.
My particular problem was that I had no 
rooting interest whatsoever. Usually, if I have 
no prior allegiances, I can pick someone to 
cheer for, but from the start of game one, I felt 
absolutely nothing for either side. The fact 
that the Angels were involved made it hard for 
me to grasp that this was actually the World 
Series. I mean, teams that finish 41 games out 
of first one year in baseball don’t play for a 
championship the next. What is this, the NFL?
. There was also a distinct lack of compelling 
story lines in this year’s edition of the Series. 
Barry Bonds’ quest for postseason success was 
fulfilled when he reached the Series, as far as 
I’m concerned, and the question of whether 
the Angels would pitch to him was moot since 
no one hitting behind him could hit a beach 
ball.
The other big story — the Angels being in 
their first World Series — was almost com­
pletely ignored by the people at Fox because, 
well, it’s still the Angels. They aren’t even 
interesting when they lose. Their big collapse 
in the ’86 ALCS isn’t even that memorable, 
since Boston went and trumped them against 
the Mets a couple of weeks later.
It’s really amazing how a little separation 
from the teams involved can lower the interest 
level of the World Series to that of a regular- 
season meeting. The gaimes themselves were 
dramatic, with four decided by a single run, 
but I already can’t remember who had the 
winning hits in games two and four and game 
six is fading fast. I wouldn’t even be surprised 
if I can’t name which two teams played as 
early as next year.
But while it may riot have been half as
enthralling as last year’s classic, it’s still the 
World Series, and not everything was as unin­
teresting as I’ve let on.
First off, Bonds is just scary good right now. 
He’s in the middle of a two-year stretch com­
pletely unprecedented in the history of base­
ball. If he can keep it up for another year or so, 
he could reach a level unattained in any pro­
fessional sport since Wayne Gretzky destroyed 
every offensive record in the NHL in the mid- 
’80s.
As bland as the Angels may be, I have to give 
them some credit, too. Anaheim dropped the 
first game of each of their three playoff series, 
and calmly came back to win by clubbing the 
ball all over the yard. Troy Glaus kept pace 
with Bonds, finishing with seven home runs to 
Bonds’ record eight, and Scott Spiezio tied a 
record with 19 RBIs.
The Angels scored 101 runs in 15 playoff 
games, over a run better per game than the 
next team (San Francisco), and struck out 
only five and a half times per game, second 
only to Oakland. The pitching staff finished 
with a mediocre 4.82 ERA, fourth among the 
eight playoff teams, but all they had to do was 
give up less than Anaheim scored, which was­
n’t hard.
Speaking of the pitching staff, the bullpen 
was phenomenal in all three series, led by the 
rookie Francisco Rodriguez, who picked up 
his first five career wins in the playoffs with a 
sub-2.00 ERA. It will be interesting to see if 
Rodriguez and fellow rookie John Lackey, 
who became the first rookie in 93 years to win 
game seven of the World Series, can continue 
their success, or if they’ll follow the model of 
Jaret Wright’s rapid downfall from a stellar 
postseason in ’97.
Lackey’s performance in game seven was 
particularly memorable, as he somehow man­
aged to earn the win despite working on three 
days rest. Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia 
may have found a way around that particular 
curse, as he never intended to keep Lackey in 
longer than five innings. On the other hand,
using the bullpen so much is risky had this not 
been the Angels’ last game of the season, and 
Lackey was relying too heavily on his slider, 
falling behind in counts and still not going to 
the fastball.
Moving on to the Giants pitching woes: it 
makes no sense why manager Dusty Baker 
went with Livan Hernandez, who didn’t make 
it out of the fourth inning in game three, 
rather than Kirk Rueter, who pitched six 
strong innings in game four. Sure enough, 
Hernandez lasted just two plus innings while 
Rueter gave up just one hit and one walk in 
four scoreless innings out of the bullpen. Even 
with Hernandez’s history as a former playoff 
MVP (with Florida in ’97) having a pitcher 
who tied for the league lead in losses star 
game seven of the World Series is question 
able, at best.
To be fair to Hernandez, however, Sunday 
was simply not the Giants’ night. Perhaps 
slightly demoralized by the Angels’ five-run 
comeback in game six, the Giants were out of 
sync all night long. Three balls hit off of 
Giants’ bats were caught by Anaheim outfield­
ers with their backs against the fence, and the 
only Giant’s hitter to get on base consistently 
(J.T. Snow) was up after the big hitters whc 
could have driven him in.
And, just like that, another season came tof 
close. A seven-game World Series was apprc 
priate for such an intriguing regular season 
which featured a tied All-Star Game, a 20- 
game wining streak, an averted strike, and 
two wild card teams battling for the champi­
onship, though even that seemed a little anti 
climactic. At least Commissioner Selig waitec 
at least a day to make some stupid announce 
ment and ruin everyone’s fun, a la contractor 
last year.
Matt Brun sheepishly admits that he missed 
the first six innings of game six to attend a 
Penguins game. The people watching TV in th> 
club row behind him did keep him updated 
though.

Bagpipe majors? At CMU?
Many students don’t even 
know that the bagpipe major 
exists. Perhaps one reason the 
major doesn’t get more pub­
licity is that there are only 
three majors: two first-years, 
and one senior.
but did not possess the coordina­
tion and patience to carry through, 
so he asked Melissa to play instead. 
She is, however, changing her 
major to mechanical engineering, 
because she is dissatisfied with the 
piping program. She said, “There 
are so many music courses, and we 
don’t get enough [bagpipe] play­
ing. We take classes with other 
music majors, and they have a 
background in music and compos­
ing, but I really do not.”
Benjamin Montross started play­
ing six years ago, for a very differ­
ent reason. “I was in Disney World, 
in Epcot Center, and there was a 
Scandinavian section with a piper, 
and he was playing traditional 
music. Then he started playing 
M.C. Hammer, and I thought it was 
really neat. I said, ‘Mom, can I do 
that?’ ”
Montross plans to either use his 
degree to teach bagpipe lessons or 
to get a minor in business and open 
a bagpipe store. He is so enamored 
with the instrument that he listens 
to traditional piping in addition to 
more current music — emo and 
hardcore. There is actually a band 
that blends these types of music, a 
pipe rock band called Seven 
Nations, one of Montross’s 
favorites.
The third bagpipe' major is sen­
ior Lyric Todkill. Says Neslund, 
“The thing about Lyric is he’s a 
very active and successful competi­
tor. He was in Scotland in competi­
tion and he seems to do enormous­
ly well. He’s very talented.” Todkill 
will graduate this year, the second 
person to receive a degree from 
the program. Patrick Regan, who 
still plays with the Pipe band, was 
the first to officially graduate.
All of the bagpipe majors play in 
the Pipe band, which performs at 
Carnival, commencement, and 
other formal events. This is, 
according to Montross, an “unspo­
ken requirement.” The band con­
sists of Scottish bagpipes and 
drums, and students get academic 
credit by playing in it. Alasdair 
Gillies, previously a highly deco­
rated piper in the British army, 
heads the band. In addition to 
playing at Carnegie Mellon events, 
the band competes, and last 
semester received first place in 
both the Loch Norman Highland 
Games in North Carolina and the 
Celtic Festival of Southern 
Maryland.
JefCu lrs/ePhotE di.TTmshies
First-year bagpipe major 
Melissa Mahoney began play­
ing about seven years ago, 
mainly because of family 
background. Her father 
always wanted to play pipes,
Benjamin Montross was inspired to learn to play after hearing a piper play an M.C. 
Hammer song.
The bagpipe, one of the most 
ancient instruments of music, 
plays a tune that is haunted and 
shrouded in mystery, and a little of 
that mystery surrounds the bag­
pipe degree program at Carnegie 
Mellon.
While bagpiping is an institution 
that has been with the school since 
it was Carnegie Tech, the bagpipe 
degree program is much newer. 
Said Jennifer Neslund, assistant to 
Alan Fletcher, head of the School 
of Music, Carnegie Mellon is “the 
first school in the country to actu­
ally offer a degree ... actually, the 
first in the world, I think.”
The idea for the degree program 
was proposed by Eldon Gatwood, a 
faculty member who has since 
retired. Jim McIntosh, who now 
performs in the Pipe band, imple­
mented the program.
The admission process and cur­
riculum for the bagpipe degree 
program is similar to other musical 
instrument degree programs in the 
School of Music. Bagpipe majors 
take studio, where they receive 
instructions in bagpiping, as well 
as the other requirements, includ­
ing music theory and history, 
ensemble, and academics.
One of the major myths 
about the program is that 
bagpipe majors get a full 
scholarship. This rumor may 
have originated from an exag­
geration of the actual scholar­
ship, which is small. First- 
year bagpipe major Benjamin 
Montross said, “Everyone 
thinks you go for free, but you 
don’t. I wish.” The same 
financial aid department that 
handles all scholarships and 
financial aid also handles the 
bagpiping scholarship.

The presidents of Carnegie Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, and 
other area schools met to discuss the growing troubles of rallies follow­
ing football victories. The exchange of these celebrations at each other’s 
schools caused physical and monetary damage to property and the dis­
ruption of classes. The two-hour meeting produced a consensus that it 
would be difficult to control these spontaneous uprisings, but that mak­
ing the details of the damage known to the student bodies was a helpful 
precautionary measure.

A meeting of the Student Senate was rocked by agitation over

who donated blood was planned instead.

Following the discovery that some terrorists in the World Trade

countries known to harbor terrorists. If passed, this bill would threaten 
the diversity of college campuses across the country, but it was widely 
doubted to have a severe impact at CMU. Students with admission to a 
prestigious school like CMU would still be able to get travel access, pre­
dicted International Students Union President Kavita Arora. Vice presi­
dent for enrollment Bill Elliot said that even if there was a cutback in 
diversity, it would not be a detrimental loss to the University.

College sex columnists createa media buzz
Chastised by the conservative press and 
hailed by the liberals, young female sex 
columnists who are writing about bondage, 
body waxing, and fake orgasms are the new 
source of information — and entertainment
— for college students everywhere.
These columns tackle sex and its endless 
cavalcade of follies with humor and knowl­
edge, truth and myths, detail and distance. 
The women who write them are confident in 
what they’re doing and their comfort shows.
Regular college sex columns are published 
in student newspapers at University of 
California at Berkeley, the University of 
Kansas, Yale University, Tufts University, and 
New York University, among others. Interest 
in their authors grows as coverage of these 
columnists’ seemingly unending courage 
makes headlines nationwide.
Natalie Krinsky, a junior at Yale University, 
pens “Sex and the (Elm) City,” a sassy week­
ly column that doesn’t dispense advice about 
sex so much as it chronicles and chides the 
inability of extremely intelligent students at a 
high-profile university to forge long-term, 
fruitful relationships. That and the occasion­
al hookup.
With tag lines like “Spit or swallow? It’s all 
about the sauce,” and “More than you ever 
wanted to know about fake orgasms,” 
Krinsky is more likely to grab a reader inter­
ested in learning of her weekend’s revelries 
than the latest development in herpes 
screenings.
Her wit is abundant and scarce is a line 
that doesn’t smack with sarcasm. In a column 
entitled, “Heading down there? Don’t waste 
your time,” where she discusses the merits of 
giving cunnilingus, Krinsky writes with acer­
bity, comparing the difficulty of giving 
decent oral sex to navigating one’s way 
through winding country roads: “Men insist 
on driving around aggressively down there 
for hours on end, not realizing that THEY 
ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.” 
Definitely brave. Definitely unapologetic.
Perhaps such chutzpah is what earned 
Krinsky national exposure in various media, 
including an article in The New York Times, an 
online article published on the website of The 
Chronicle of Higher Education, and countless 
other web publications. She’s even gotten 
coverage on VirtuaUerusalem.com, “The 
Place Where Jews Click,” although she main­
tains that she is a “secular Zionist,” according 
to the article on VirtualJerusalem.com.
In the Yale Alumni Magazine, Krinsky is 
quoted as saying, “People may have [trouble] 
separating who I am from what I write.”
Amber Madison writes a 
weekly column in the Tufts 
Daily called “Between the 
Sheets.” She intends to 
parlay her current gig not 
into a writing career, but 
rather into a community 
service career.
Madison, a sophomore 
with a double major in 
community health and 
American studies (com­
bining courses from the 
two departments to 
approach a degree in 
human sexuality), would 
like to be part of a greater 
cause: educating women 
and girls about sexual 
health and awareness.
Through her column, she 
claims, she can start to 
reach that demographic 
and help out to the best of 
her ability.
“I have two goals [in 
writing this column]. One 
is to educate people about 
STDs — especially human 
papilloma diseases 
(HPVs) — and how to 
keep themselves safe, and 
the second is to raise girls’ 
awareness about their 
own sexuality.... Girls 
don’t enjoy sex as much as 
guys. It’s not fair,” says 
Madison.
Women like Madison 
are no longer allowing the 
cultural disparity that 
exists between men and 
women’s sex lives to 
thrive. “A guy who has a 
lot of sex is a pimp. A girl who has a lot of sex 
is a slut.”
Columns like hers are powerful because 
they allow people to discuss sex on a casual 
level. They give girls the same weight as guys 
when it comes to chatting about the opposite 
sex. They turn the tables on the established 
roles that have defined the genders for ages. 
And it’s also a lot easier to talk to a boyfriend, 
friend, or anyone else about sex if it’s sitting 
in print in front of you.
Dr. Dean C. Dauw, a clinical sexologist 
based in Chicago, agrees wholeheartedly 
with these young women’s humorous 
approach to discussing sex. “I think it’s very 
important that we [take a light approach to 
talking about sex]. It helps to resolve the
problem of ignorance about sex, and maybe 
this could start more people on the right 
course early in life.”
Perhaps support like this explains why 
young women seem to be comfortable with 
taking the reins when it comes to talking 
about sex. Since no man has ever tried to fig­
ure out what a girl really wants, why not tell 
him — and the entire rest of the student pop­
ulation — yourself?
Madison, in fact, invites both genders to 
enjoy her column. “Because it’s about sex, 
guys read it also and hopefully they learn 
something.”
While not claiming “sexpertise,” Madison 
definitely claims freedom of speech. But this 
freedom that she exercises weekly could also
be the source of condemnation from not only 
elders but also peers, she realizes. That is def­
initely not stopping her.
Discussing the possibility of any negative 
feedback, Madison says, “I’m sure there are a 
lot of people who feel that way. I think when­
ever you put yourself on the line and work 
with an issue that’s personal, some people 
are going to give bad feedback because they 
don’t like [what you’re writing], and I’m just 
going to have to deal with it.”
At least her parents won’t take part in the 
criticisms. “My parents are very open and 
very liberal. My mom actually proofreads 
everything I write.”

Damn good burritos at Qdoba
If ever you see a crowd half-spilling out of 
Forbes Avenue’s newest addition, Qdoba 
Mexican Grill, please don’t blame inclement 
October weather — they haven’t come for the 
shelter so much as the burritos. Because this is 
what Qdoba [cue - doba] is quickly becoming 
known for.
A quick glance at one of the several menus 
tacked strategically onto its walls betrays the 
restaurant’s intent towards this latest take on 
conspicuous consumption. Burritos, large and 
small (this is relative, as you’ll see), crowd out 
tacos, nachos, chips, dips, salads, and more, as 
they stand, to paraphrase Bill Buckley, athwart 
your senses yelling STOP. And stop you will, if 
only to seize a glimpse of the assembly-line pro­
ficiency with which the Qdoba factotums shape, 
press, knead, fill, and wrap the final product — 
your 22-ounce regular-sized burrito, fatter than 
a country sow. (That’s the relative part.)
That this is not your average burrito and that 
portions of this sort, especially at a spot stream­
lined for speed and efficiency, are a rare thing is 
not a surprise. This honor is reserved for the 
actual eating of the thing, apparently a 
Sisyphean effort since this reviewer observed 
many couples requesting a container for their 
burritos in order to finish the job at some later 
point, dispirited faces on them all.
The surprise then, is the rules of this game. 
You must come to eat, you see; to attempt a go at 
the three burrito high-water mark (as this 
reviewer chose to do) is like trading punches 
with boxing legend Rocky Marciano. Round One 
finds you cocky and ebullient, in your confi­
dence you’ve underestimated a scrappy oppo­
nent. Round Two brings you back to reality: your 
swagger is slowed, your chest heaves as you 
struggle to keep up, every breath feeling like a 
chore. By Round Three the Brockton 
Blockbuster has you bloodied, battered, and cry­
ing for your mother; a turgid belly and the assis­
tance of the kitchen staff in helping you trundle 
yourself to the door reminds you, alas, you 
should’ve seen that TKO coming.
Ok, so they’ve got big burritos, you say. So 
what? Well then, Mr. Not-Easily-Impressed, let’s 
move on to particulars. Qdoba functions on a 
kind of line-based prep system that would make 
Henry Ford blush. Each individual on this queue 
has some duty, be it tortilla-steamer, bean- 
spooner, or salsa-slinger. Your mission, as out­
lined by the helpful ordering system located on 
the menus, is to decide which burrito (signature 
or regular), what bean type, which salsa variety, 
and what kind of topper (cheese or sour cream), 
you want. (It’s fair to say that this procedure 
should be carried out with increasing speed 
each time you visit Qdoba, since long lines nor­
mally don’t abide indecision.)
The burritos and tacos themselves offer four 
kinds of meat: chicken, ground sirloin, steak, 
and shredded beef. The signatures, which are 
somewhat more elaborate in terms of ingredi­
ents than their regular burrito counterparts, 
contain such things as eggplant, bell peppers, 
pine nuts, and a slightly piquant sauce called 
mole. Best bet? Try the Fajita Ranchera. The 
meat (don’t fret, there is also a veggie burrito) is 
subjected to slow marinating before it actually 
becomes tortilla stuffing, according to 
owner/operator Chad Brooks, who will attempt 
to ply you with Qdoba’s in-house guacamole if 
you even breathe to him that you’ve never tried 
it before.
There is one more wrinkle here: nearly every­
one on the staff wears a t-shirt emblazoned with 
a catch phrase declaring that you “Try it Naked!” 
Before you get any ideas, it’s much more innocu­
ous than it sounds. “Naked” refers to a burrito 
sans tortilla, served in a bowl for the fork-friend- 
ly. (Though one wonders what all the fuss is
about, since college students need little goading 
to try anything naked, least of all Mexican food.)
So, next time you find yourself down Forbes 
Avenue way, attempting to bridge that crucial 
Mensa-Dixon line half-way between Pitt and 
Carnegie Mellon, stop by Qdoda Mexican Grill. 
But go early — like that 22-ounce signature bur­
rito of yours, the crowds at this Mexican lunch 
spot may be bursting past capacity.

Good safe sex
Students didn’t learn how to fake an orgasm, but they did learn 
about the emotional and physiological aspects of sex, truths 
instead of urban legends surrounding sex, and details of climax­
ing.
Anita Barkin, director of Student Health Services, gave an 
informative talk last Thursday in the Connan Room, during which 
she addressed topics that often raise questions, such as the G-spot, 
female orgasms, and how hormones affect male and female sex 
drives.
Barkin explained that the brain should be considered the main 
sexual organ, because sexual urges and feelings begin in the brain, 
triggered by testosterone. Sexual urges are different in men and 
women. Women’s sexual urges are tied to their thought process 
and emotional state more than men’s. Several factors often cause 
misunderstanding between men and women and create problems
— for example, the fact that the sexual drive of men peaks in their 
teens while that of women peaks in their thirties. Women’s sex 
drive is increased during their mid-cycle when their testosterone 
levels are increased.
Barkin also shed light on the differences between male and 
female orgasms due to the differences in their physiology. For 
women, “every orgasm is a little different,” she said. While the 
male orgasm is more easily attained than the female orgasm, 
women are capable of experiencing another climax after thirty 
minutes, while men can take up to a day to recuperate.
“Women become aroused more slowly than men,” said Barkin. 
She said that men often become frustrated when women do not 
warm up as quickly as they do. She also provided the audience 
with some shocking facts. For example, in a survey conducted on 
486 women, 310 had revealed that they faked an orgasm every 
time they had intercourse. Barkin explained that our culture does 
not always support the female right to orgasm and many women 
feel pressured to orgasm simultaneously with their partners.
One of the most important questions Barkin asked was “what 
makes a good lover?” Each member of the audience seemed to 
have a different answer to this question, showing how healthy sex­
ual relations at the end come down to being sensitive to one’s 
partner’s individual needs. On their way out, each student was 
given a booklet titled “The Good Sex Menu,” which included help­
ful advice and ideas for enjoyable and safe sexual experiences. A 
condom was attached to each booklet, reminding the audience 
members of the importance of safe sex.

Transcribe, Translate, Transcend: 
opening lecture for Paradise Now
Peter C. Johnson, proudly admits to being 
a closet artist. He draws and paints water- 
colors when he is not performing his duties 
as a cosmetic surgeon, running his company 
Tissuelnformatics Inc., or making shows like 
Paradise Now possible.
Showing in the Miller Gallery through 
December 15, Paradise Now is a collection 
of work exploring the possibilities of genetic 
engineering which may one day be realized. 
It is a collection of sculpture, installation, 
and paintings, some by artists drawn to 
working with scientific technology to create 
biology-based art, and other pieces by scien­
tists with a creative bent.
Johnson spent the first 20 minutes of the 
lecture explaining the biology behind the 
exhibit, beginning with the title, 
“Transcribe, Translate, Transcend.” In brief, 
transcription is the beginning of the process 
of replicating the chromosomes, the copy­
ing of DNA to produce an RNA transcript; 
translation is the process of decoding a 
strand of mRNA and turning it into proteins; 
and transcendence is rising above, sur­
mounting, exceeding. This last term has 
dual significance: Johnson made the point 
that biology transcends the genome, 
because genes dictate the proteins pro­
duced, which in turn dictate the structure of 
the organism, which in turn dictates the 
physiology of the organism. Secondly, 
Johnson hopes that society as a whole will 
transcend the “age-old problem of under­
standing” in order to deal with the genetic 
revolution that is taking place.
The tight collaboration between art and 
science in this exhibit is almost unprece­
dented. Johnson believes the importance of 
collaboration and crossing over is “one of 
the best lessons coming from this exhibit.” 
He hopes that more collaborations like this
will occur in the future, and believes that 
they are of great importance in our struggle 
to deal with the new power and pitfalls that 
await us now that the genome has been 
mapped and biotechnology is expanding at 
a great rate. Visual art not only comments 
on science and sometimes puts necessary 
checks on it, in his opinion, but also helps 
explain to the public what is going on in the 
scientific community.
Johnson suggested that art can be used as 
propaganda, and related this to the idea 
that there is good art and bad art, just as 
there is good science and bad science. There 
is propaganda that urges the public to do 
something good for mankind, and other 
propaganda that promotes hate and vio­
lence against others. He used examples of 
World War II posters to illustrate. 
Propaganda, both good and bad, can have 
great influence on public thinking, just as 
good art and bad art can. The danger, 
according to Johnson, arises when artists 
with minimal scientific understanding 
equate biotechnical practice with corporate 
greed and malevolent ends. In response to 
this, Johnson says scientists see artists as 
emphasizing public fears for shock value, 
and thus more media attention and mone­
tary gain, in their works. Johnson did not 
comment on any artists’ responses to those 
sorts of claims, which essentially invalidate 
their art.
Johnson’s hope is that exhibits like this — 
with works that are innovative and not just 
textbook illustrations of DNA — will bring 
scientists and artists together to inform their 
community and help both parties under­
stand the other better.

ent appendages of a gryphon-like beast resem­
bling a mythological creature. “Interior #5” by 
Aziz and Crucher presented a mystery until fur­
ther inspected. The uninitiated observer sees an 
interior space such as a plain room, but in skin 
tone, and upon closer examination, discovers 
that it is actually human skin. The message of this 
piece is that engineering and construction is no 
longer confined to large-scale physical structures 
such as buildings and interiors, but has expanded 
through development of tissue engineering to 
constructing cellular structures as well.
The many pieces in the exhibit express many 
perspectives on issues in bioengineering that 
artists and society may perceive. “Well, I like 
them, they balance it. Different artists have dif­
ferent opinions, so it’s not biased,” said Adam 
Sipe, art handler and exhibition assistant for the 
show.
The underlying theme of the exhibit makes 
viewers consider the ethical responsibility that 
must be considered when verging on an era 
where the impossible in medicine and technology 
becomes reality.

Paradise Now: Picturing 
the Genetic Revolution
Regina Gouger Miller Gallery 
October 25 - December 15 
Free
Artist Lecture: 
Alexis Rockman 
Thursday, November 14, 5 pm 
McConomy Auditorium, UC
Paradise Now: genetic art
One view of art is that it should push the enve­
lope on social issues by provoking emotion and 
thought. It can invite the audience to ponder a 
depiction of reality that may paradoxically lie 
entirely within the artist’s imagination. The cur­
rent exhibition at the Regina Gouger Miller 
Gallery, Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic 
Revolution is successful in that respect. While 
pieces are quite varied, there is a theme of explor­
ing options and new possibilities on the horizon 
of genetics.
The Miller gallery has a subdued, almost 
hushed feeling and an industrial ambience with 
concrete. The white walls on which the art is 
hung create a clinical feeling, which provided an 
appropriately sterile atmosphere for the exhibi­
tion dealing with genetics and topics on molecu­
lar and cellular levels.
Kevin Clarke’s “Portrait of James D. Watson” is 
an impressive 8'xl6' visual representation of the 
DNA sequence of James Watson, best known for 
his discovery of DNA, for which he and collabora­
tors Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins shared the 
1962 Nobel Price in Medicine. It is a definitive 
and fitting piece for this exhibition since the ori­
gin of many of the issues represented throughout 
the collection can be traced back to Watson’s dis­
covery of DNA.
“The Digital Divide” uses manicured finger 
nails to represent different identities and person­
alities with a direct connection between these 
qualities and the DNA double helices. It spurs an 
intriguing visual argument about the nature of 
personality and whether its roots lie in the genes 
that we inherit or in the environment. Adjacent is 
a collection of ll"xl7" ink and water color pieces 
by Rebecca Howland. A passerby commented 
these are his favorite in reference to Howland’s 
unique and sometimes quirky, humorous scrawl- 
ings. Each piece takes a different perspective on 
the new possibilities for genetics, biology, and 
life.
The focus of Alexis Rockman’s “The Farm,” a 
piece that has toured from New York, is the pro­
gression of livestock and crops through evolu­
tion, breeding, and genetic modification. The 
cubic watermelons depicted in this painting are 
already produced in Japan. Other images includ­
ed a blue-ribbon pedigree pet pooch, a pig twice 
as large as a normal sow, a semi-rectangular cow, 
augmented tomatoes, and a three-winged chick­
en. These images predict a revolution for the agri­
culture industry in its efforts to support the grow­
ing world appetite.
“Hybrids” by Eva Sutton is an interactive multi- 
media piece combining prints with animal 
sounds that plays as the user clicks on the differ-“Pinkie,” by Bryan Crockett.

Homewood Cemetery legends
JL wenty steps from the bus stop at Forbes 
Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard, you see 
the rows of tombstones in The Homewood 
Cemetery. Walking a little further, the num­
ber of tombstones doubles, mausoleums 
interspersed among the rainwater-stained 
granite epitaphs. Through the first Forbes 
Avenue entrance, lining the hillside are vary­
ing durations of life and degrees of kinship — 
1929-1941, 1904-1979, 1906-1908, hus­
band, wife, daughter — and you know that 
over the hill, the number of grave markers 
will be overwhelming.
You get a feeling of unease. Some of the 
tombstones are so old that the inscriptions 
are completely illegible. Some are still read­
able, just discolored from the tarnishing 
effect of years of rainfall. Some plots are 
fresh, the dirt newly piled on the casket that 
lies beneath.
Though these characteristics are compara­
ble to many cemeteries, The Homewood 
Cemetery has an idiosyncratic antiquity that 
other cemeteries may not. In the midst of the 
175 acres of land filled with people of differ­
ent ethnic backgrounds, beliefs, and promi­
nence, lie stories of odd coincidence, eerie 
superstition, and fantastic history.
The stories presented in this article were 
taken from written accounts in The 
Homewood Cemetery’s literary publication 
The Homewood as well as oral accounts, both 
of which were given by Marilyn Evert, assis­
tant treasurer of The Homewood Cemetery, 
and Janet Kettering, assistant secretary. Most 
of the people mentioned have been buried at 
Homewood or are the ancestors of those 
buried there.
The Story of Bill Hill
Bill Hill was hired as a gravedigger at 
Homewood Cemetery in January 1947. 
Before mechanization, grave digging took 
several hours to complete and required some­
one with a strong back. One night, after 
spending half a day digging a plot in the sin­
gle grave section of the cemetery, he was told 
by the general manager that the family who 
had originally ordered the plot decided to 
purchase a plot in another section of the 
cemetery. Instead of covering it back up, he 
was told to leave it open, since single plots 
were used often. That evening, while Hill was 
riding the bus home, he suffered a fatal heart 
attack. His body was buried at The 
Homewood Cemetery, his casket placed in 
the same grave that he had dug four days ear­
lier.
The Unlucky Horseshoe
A superstition dating back to 1634 says 
that hearing an approaching gallop of a horse
with a loose horseshoe is a sign of imminent 
danger. Martha Graham Black (1877-1974), 
buried in Section 6, Lot 33 of The Homewood 
Cemetery died of natural causes, but her fam­
ily has a history of tragedy.
The first of Graham Black’s ancestors to 
hear the gallop was Annie Hutchinson. She 
heard it the day before she was forced to flee 
England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony 
due to charges of heresy. She and her family 
eventually settled in New York, where she 
kept a sick Native American child named 
Lenni during the winter until the child was 
well. In 1643 Hutchinson heard the clicking 
of the loose horseshoe, but found that it was 
only Lenni’s father asking if Hutchinson’s 
granddaughter could come and visit at the 
camp.
“[Lenni] went,” said Kettering in her 
account of the tale in The Homewood, “but 
soon realized that she was a prisoner of the 
Indians. It wasn’t until she was mysteriously 
released over a month later that she learned 
that Annie and her family had been massa­
cred by the Indians the night she was taken.”
Over a half-century later, the clicking 
horseshoe was heard in Pennsylvania by 
Hutchinson’s great-great-granddaughter, 
Martha, when she thought she heard her hus­
band, Samuel MacFarlane, approaching the 
house on his horse. No one else in the house 
heard the clicking, but her brother-in-law 
agreed to go investigate. A neighbor was on 
the doorstep with Samuel’s horse and report­
ed that he had been killed at Valley Forge.
In 1795, Reverend William Graham 
MacFarlane left Gettysburg to travel as a mis­
sionary. Several weeks after his departure, 
the sound of the loose horseshoe was heard 
after the last prayer of evening worship. 
Martha went to the church door only to see 
her husband’s horse — without her husband. 
Once she was told of his death, she secluded 
herself in her room. She died shortly after­
ward.
Reverend James Graham, great-grandfa­
ther to Martha Graham Black, was the next to 
succumb to the horseshoe’s foreshadowing. 
In 1845, his fam­
ily was waiting 
for him to return 
from a pastoral 
call when they 
heard the horse­
shoes approach­
ing. They found 
James in one 
piece riding in on 
his horse, even 
though he was 
covered in mud 
from falling off 
of his horse. He
fell into a coma that evening and died three 
days later.
Mrs. Early, cousin to Martha Graham 
Black, and her daughters were staying in her 
summerhouse when they heard the clickety- 
click sound of approaching horse hooves. In 
her younger years, Early had heard the sound 
prior to finding out that her fiancé, who was 
then a Confederate soldier, had been killed 
after being thrown from his horse while 
sneaking through enemy lines to visit her. 
“Thank God you heard it,” Early said. “I 
thought I was the only one.” She became ill 
the next morning and died after two weeks.
The Rabbit
There was once a groundskeeper at The 
Homewood Cemetery from Croatia who had 
a superstition that rabbits were evil. One day 
while he and his coworker were outside, they 
spotted a rabbit. His coworker attempted to 
shoo the rabbit away.
“He kept telling him, ‘Don’t mess with that 
rabbit! Don’t mess with that rabbit,’ ” said 
Kettering. “ ‘It’s evil.’ ”
The coworker didn’t listen and died of a 
heart attack shortly after.
The Gatehouse
Kettering’s home is by the Homewood 
Cemetery’s main office entrance on South 
Dallas Avenue. She has lived there for the 
past 14 years, working at the cemetery.
“Usually if the cemetery is old enough,” 
said Marilyn Evert, assistant treasurer of the 
Homewood Cemetery, “you’ll have a gate­
house for the groundskeeper. The name 
[gatehouse] was given to the building 
because of its location next to the iron gate.”
Eighty years ago the house caught fire, 
trapping the superintendent of that time 
within its walls.
A cellular phone company was interested in 
putting a tower on top of the chapel and 
needed to take pictures at different angles in
order to decide where the best place would 
be. Upon getting the pictures back, 
Kettering noticed that there was a strange 
glow in the top left corner of the picture 
which caught the side of her house. She at 
first thought it was a smudge and took it to 
the photo shop. They were not able to 
explain what the image could be. No scien­
tific explanation, that is, as it was guessed 
that the smudge could be a spirit of the 
house.
Kettering recalled a story in which her 
mother, who was blind, had an encounter 
with the spirit when she was living with 
Kettering. She said that it had approached 
her one evening and asked for her to follow. 
Kettering’s mother refused.
“She said that it wasn’t time for her to go 
yet,” said Kettering.
Lieutenant Daniel W. Brooks
Lieutenant Daniel W. Brooks, Company F, 
one hundred and eleventh infantry, twenty- 
eighth division, was killed in action on 
September 6, 1918 in the Fismes offensive 
during World War I. The procession for his 
funeral traveled from Swissvale to The 
Homewood Cemetery in Squirrel Hill. The 
procession was led by a 30-piece Pittsburgh 
military band. His horse pulled his coffin.
At the end of the ceremony, Brooks’s 
horse stayed at his grave. People attempted 
to move the horse, but it would not budge, 
seeming to know that its master was gone 
forever. Eventually, the horse was coaxed to 
leave the grounds.
“It’s a story that a lot of people would relate 
to,” said Evert.
The stories behind those that are buried at 
The Homewood Cemetery add to its histori­
cal value. Many notable figures of Pittsburgh 
have been buried on the grounds, including 
members of the Benedum family.

Ghost stories around town
Pitt, Duquesne offer collegiate haunts
ut of the corner of your eye, you see 
something move. Goosebumps rise on your 
skin and it feels like you’re being watched. 
Your mind reels with the possibilities. It’s 
entirely possible that you’re being stalked 
again by that lovelorn first-year from down 
the hall, or maybe it’s something a little less 
frightening and you are experiencing a 
ghostly encounter.
Pittsburgh’s “otherworldly” side has a 
rich history, one that includes the
Underground Railroad, a mad scientist, 
and a seedy brothel, the stuff that makes up a 
scary movie writer’s wet dreams.
201 Bruce Hall, University of Pittsburgh
Bruce Hall is a primarily upperclass stu­
dent dorm in the Schenley Quadrangle off 
Forbes Avenue, except for the second floor, 
including room 201. It’s mostly used for 
catering dinners and receptions and many of
the waiters and other staff who have worked 
there have reported many a strange and 
unexplained experience, including eerie 
noises, moving objects, and ghostly footfalls, 
especially in the later hours of the night. A 
particularly notable event was when a fully 
doused fireplace was said to have re-ignited 
by itself into a roaring fire.
The story behind 201 Bruce Hall is a famil­
iar one of forbidden passion and murderous 
jealousy. It surrounds the double suicide of 
the wife and the mistress of the man who 
owned the Schenley Hotel. “The Waldorf of 
Pittsburgh,” that once commanded the 
Pittsburgh social scene, became the William 
Pitt Student Union. One of the women report­
edly jumped to her death from the top of the 
building and the other hanged herself from 
the balcony behind the fireplace.
Details are sketchy at best about why the 
two women would’ve committed suicide and 
no one really seems to know if it actually hap­
pened, but the Office of Special Events at Pitt 
seems content to believe the rumors. They 
have named their ghost Harriett and hang a 
Christmas stocking for her every year.
A senior English major at Pitt and former 
inhabitant of Bruce Hall, Jess Chang, isn’t 
easily frightened by the stories.
“There are a billion stories you hear as a 
freshman about the dorms. Whether it’s a 
nun hanging herself in one of the rooms of 
the Cathedral of Learning or ghosts on the 
soccer field. Every place has these urban leg­
ends and Pitt’s no different. It’s just a way of 
making a place interesting,” she said. 
“Besides, I’ve seen scarier things happen in 
that hall, and it has nothing to do with 
ghosts.”
Ghosts of the Underground Railroad
Duquesne University has its fair share of 
resident spirits — the college used to be 
named the Pittsburgh Catholic College of the 
Holy Ghost. But none are as intriguing or as 
steeped in American history as those located 
in the “Old Main” Administration building. 
The basement of “Old Main” used to be a hub 
in the Underground Railroad, the system of 
tunnels and homes manned by sympathetic 
allies attempting to help slaves escape. 
Unfortunately, freedom for the slaves was 
often short-lived and instead of meeting their 
destiny, many met only doom. Numerous 
unexplained happenings have been reported 
by workers and staff. Doors and lights act on 
their own, voices are said to be heard through 
the vents and the sounds of chains rattling 
often fill the halls.
Another haunted location on Duquesne’s 
campus is Fischer Hall, named after Chester 
Fischer, the founder of Fischer Scientific 
Company. The hall was home, for nearly a 
century, to the company until it relocated to 
North Fayette, PA, after Chester died in the 
building. He is now said to have permanent
residence in Fischer Hall. The building is now 
connected to campus by a skywalk, and one 
student reported that it is not uncommon to 
see an old man open the door of the skywalk 
for them before vanishing into thin air when 
they turn back to thank him.
The Most Haunted House in America
Said to have been the most haunted house 
in America, 1129 Ridge Avenue in the 
Manchester area of the North Side has a past 
that nightmares are made of.
Originally the former home of a carpetbag­
ger named Charles Wright Congelier, his wife 
Lyda, and their young servant Essie, this 
house began its story, appropriately enough, 
on a dark winter night in 1871. Wife Lyda dis­
covered that husband Charles had been car­
rying on an affair with the maid. In a mur­
derous rampage, she fatally stabbed Charles 
in the back and chopped off Essie’s head. The 
house stood looming and vacant for the next 
20 years, until it was remodeled by railroad 
workers in 1892, but they soon moved out, 
claiming to hear the sobbing and screaming 
of a phantom woman.
In 1900, Dr. Adolph C. Brunrichter bought 
the home. Few saw him outside of his home, 
but on August 12,1901 the neighbors heard a 
terrifying scream and when they ran outside 
to investigate, they witnessed, as reported to 
the authors in the book Haunted Houses “red 
explosion like flash shooting through the 
house. The earth under them trembled, and 
the sidewalks cracked. Every window in the 
doctor’s home was shattered.” During the 
investigation of the explosion, detectives dis­
covered the doctor’s chamber of horrors.
Unbeknownst to the neighbors, the good 
doctor had been conducting experiments on 
women’s headless bodies to see if he could 
keep them alive after their beheading. They 
found a decomposed female body strapped to 
the bed and more buried in basement graves. 
Brunrichter vanished and the house once 
again stood vacant until once again it was 
remodeled in order to house emigrant 
Equitable Gas Company workers, but they, 
too, fell prey to the strange occurrences of the 
house and one night, two workers were found 
dead in the basement. One had had a board 
driven like a stake through his chest and 
another had been hanged from the rafters.
In 1920, Thomas Edison, came to study the 
house with a machine that he believed could 
help foster communication with the dead. His 
visit would later strongly influence his strong 
belief in the afterlife. Seven years later, a 
drunkard was arrested claiming to be the 
missing Dr. Brunrichter. He told the police 
gruesome stories of torture, sex, and demon­
ic possession, but the police could never cor­
roborate his identity and he was released, 
never to be seen again.

1129 Ridge Avenue’s haunted house 
came to an end and on the morning of 
November 15, 1927 when an explosion 
ripped through the county as a giant gas 
tank owned by the Equitable Gas Company 
exploded, completely decimating the 
house and much of the nearby area. The 
Most Haunted House in America, which is 
currently the site of the Route 65/1-279 
interchange near the Carnegie Science 
Center, is the only house of which no trace 
would ever be found again.
The Phantoms of the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse
The Pittsburgh Playhouse, a 100-year- 
old theater on Craft Avenue in Oakland, is 
popularly known as the “spookiest place in 
Pittsburgh.” It’s been everything from the 
Tree of Life Synagogue to a brothel, and is 
known for those who never left. The cast of
personalities are as diverse as their stories, 
but their legacy has stayed the same. This 
band includes John Johns, The Lady in 
White, Weeping Eleanor, Gorgeous 
George, and The Bounding Red Meanie 
(also called Bouncing Loony).
John Johns was a prominent Pittsburgh 
actor who met his demise during a banquet 
in the restaurant that used to be in the 
playhouse basement. To this day students 
working backstage report seeing a man in 
an old-fashioned tuxedo check the sets and 
the props, and often hear footsteps.
The Lady in White is said to have been 
an actress married in the church that once 
had its home in the playhouse. During the 
reception she found out that her husband 
was having an affair with one of the 
women from the brothel and shot him 
before plunging to her death off the bal­
cony. She is often seen walking across the 
balcony, gun eternally in hand.
Weeping Eleanor was once an inhabi­
tant of the row houses that stood where 
the dressing rooms now exist. One day a 
fire swept through the houses. Everyone 
survived ... except for Eleanor and her 
young daughter. Rumor has it that she can 
be heard crying inside one of the dressing 
rooms, though no one’s ever seen her.
Gorgeous George is, in fact, the most 
hideous of the ghosts. He is, apparently, a 
green man with a decaying face who taps 
on the window of the costume shop, scar­
ing all inside. The details of his death have 
been lost in the annals of history.
The Bouncing Red Meanie is the most 
recent-of the stories and definitely the 
most disturbing. He is believed to have first 
appeared Halloween night in 1974 when 
students working late in the playhouse 
decided to hold a séance. During the 
séance a man appeared dressed in red with 
a worried expression on his face and pac­
ing. He went back and forth, picking up 
speed until he was bouncing off all the 
walls and the ceiling. Then every phone in 
the building rang, as the theater filled with 
people all dressed in turn of the century 
clothing. The students ran and all gave 
separate but matching accounts of the 
events.
Robert Janosko, a former Pitt student 
and staff member of the Playhouse invites 
all to experience the playhouse and its 
spirits. “Over my five years of classes [at 
Pitt ] I have picked up these stories, and 
even experienced some of the ghosts 
myself. If you are ever in Pittsburgh and 
want to try and experience the supernatu­
ral, visit the Playhouse. They’ll be waiting 
for you.... ”
Few can deny the overwhelming tragedy 
behind most of these stories and even 
fewer can argue that these stories have 
also been fudged over the years. Despite 
the blurred line between fact and fiction, 
these stories continue to survive.
Junior ECE major and native 
Pittsburgher Zavo Gabriel says she doesn’t 
believe the stories and her experiences 
with ghosts aren’t legend material.
“But I do enjoy the stories. They’re nice 
and creepy, especially here, since the city’s 
got such a wonderfully rich history and so 
many old places ripe for haunting. Every 
house in Pittsburgh has its own story. You 
won’t get that anywhere else, really.”

Hip-hop
heiroglyphics
Kuntu Repertory Theatre’s produc­
tion of Hieroglyphic Graffiti, a young 
play written and directed by Chadwick 
Boseman, retells the Egyptian legend 
of Isis, Osiris, and Set, three siblings 
locked in a lifelong bond of love, mur­
der, and secrets. Though the plot may 
be a thousand-year-old surprise for 
some, the events themselves take a 
backseat to lyrical writing and a pun­
gent mixture of surrealism, hip-hop, 
and myth.
The play, previously performed at 
the National Black and New York Hip- 
Hop Theatre Festivals, is utterly lyrical
— its rhythmic language is reminis­
cent of Irish playwrights Brian Friel 
and Sean O’Casey, poets famous for 
their ruby-rich phraseology. For a pri­
marily expressionistic play especially, 
a sense of logic prevails — we feel we 
are in the capable hands of a writer 
with a strong sense of direction. This 
play could wield considerable force, 
under different production circum­
stances.
Set designer Kenneth Ellis could 
have placed set pieces to clarify the 
space rather than to shut off its energy. 
Clutter completely takes over the 
crowded-and-crunched “store” por­
tion of the set, except where more 
would make sense, as on the nearly- 
barren bookshelves. And the “street” 
side of the stage, for all the visual 
space it took up, was barely used.
Lights by Jason Peroney did little to 
narrate the play’s fickle moods or dif­
ferentiate between subtle environment 
changes. Lighting design bears the 
heavy responsibility of guiding the
audience’s eye around the set, and in 
surreal worlds like Graffiti’s, explana­
tion through light can be vital. No such 
help was present here — lit by glaring, 
warm white light, much of the play 
took on a monotonous sitcom quality, 
and when mood lighting did occur, its 
oblique angles and unmitigated shad­
ows often obscured actors’ faces 
entirely.
Cameron Walker Miller’s sound 
design was at times obtrusive, at times 
too weakly felt. The volume levels 
were almost always either too loud or 
too soft, and the durations of the vari­
ous nature sounds and music were 
generic and did little to punctuate or 
highlight the action. For a piece of the­
ater that subscribes to the hip-hop aes­
thetic, the aural rhythms of the show 
weren’t strong, striking choices but 
generic gestures that seemed to stick 
out every which-way.
For all its brave earnestness and slip­
pery syllogisms, Hieroglyphic Graffiti 
bears the unripe burden of talent not 
yet fully realized. Amateurish produc­
tion values diminish its impact, but for 
lovers of thoughtful new stage materi­
al, its appeal will not be ruined by 
shoddy trappings.
Take a chance. It might not be what 
you expect — and maybe that’s the 
best thing of all.

Art history in theater
Pentecost, the School of Drama’s first 
mainstage production this season, offers 
a mind-bending perspective on what a 
piece of artwork means to different 
groups of people.
In an eastern European country that 
has been overshadowed in all aspects by 
its neighbors, the local art historian dis­
covers a painting in an abandoned 
church that, if proven authentic, could 
change the entire history of art as we 
know it. From the local priests to nation­
al leaders to a group of refugees who 
seek asylum, the precise value of art and 
truth is rendered through the eyes of 
these characters.
Pentecost was written by British politi­
cal playwright David Edgar. It is a story 
that challenges the audience on the val­
ues of a piece of history. On the surface, 
the painting is the key to the down-and- 
out country’s rise to an artistically promi­
nent role. But beneath the seemingly 
materialistic intention is another story­
line concerning the authenticity of the 
artwork and its importance to the future 
of the refugees.
The story is deftly woven together, 
with the first act focusing on the discov­
ery of the painting and the second act 
emphasizing the story of the refugees.
The mystery of the painting kept the 
audience in suspense as the answer 
unraveled throughout the show, but, as 
intriguing as it was, the show was too
long.
Pentecost clocked in at about three 
hours and the overly long, repetitive 
scenes impeded the story progression a 
great deal. In a scene where the refugees 
and their hostages are anticipating the 
outcome of their demands, the group 
begins to share stories from their home­
lands. Mind you, this is a big group, with 
no less than ten people. One, two, or 
even three tales could faithfully capture 
the sympathetic bond forming among 
these people; therë is no need for every­
one to go. What started out as a fresh, 
uplifting turn to the sad story slowly 
transformed to a languid scene that took 
after the Energizer bunny — it went on 
and on and on.
The actors, on the other hand, were 
quite impressive. This is a show that 
relies strongly on speaking heavily- 
accented English, and the actors pulled it 
off without a hitch, making their charac­
ters completely believable — whether 
they were playing British art historians 
or pompous national leaders. Even when 
the story became slow at times, the cast’s 
performance drove the show forward.
Pentecost closed on Saturday, October 
26. The School of Drama’s next main­
stage production will be Pierre 
Marivaux’s Game of Love and Chance.

MUViC
A-side: J-LoB-side: Bowie
Can an actress have a successful music career? Is it possible for 
a musician to be well received in film? Where is the line drawn 
between genres of entertainment? The Mix Tape investigates.
Jennifer Lopez used to receive more attention for the size of her backside 
than the quality of her work. In recent years, however, Lopez’s career has sky­
rocketed. She has built a multimedia empire consisting of dance, music, 
movies, fashion, and fragrances. But 
Lopez wasn’t always the mainstream 
success we know her as today. She was 
able to work her way from humble 
beginnings to pop superstardom with 
nothing but her drive to achieve her 
dreams.
From a very young age, Lopez wanted 
to be in the limelight. She spent her 
early years cultivating her craft through 
dance and voice lessons. In her teen 
years she rode the six train to 
Manhattan for various classes and audi­
tions. Her efforts proved fruitful when 
she was cast as a Flygirl for the popular 
series In Living Color. She landed her 
breakthrough role as deceased Latin 
pop icon Selena in 1997. Following 
Selena's success, Lopez was offered rolls 
in various films and soon became a 
Hollywood staple.
Once she’d established herself as a 
marketable actress, she began to delve into other areas of the entertainment 
industry. “Music has always been an important part of my life,” Lopez said, 
when speaking about her first album titled On The 6. “This album completes 
the journey. Doing television, the movies, and now this, I’m actually accom­
plishing what I set out to do.”
However, many are critical of Lopez’s leap to music. “It seemed kind of sud­
den,” says Andrea Fuller, a first-year student here and J. Lo fan. “One of my 
favorite movies is The Wedding Planner. I can listen to some of the songs and 
enjoy them — I love the music I can dance to — but some of the others are not 
as good.”
Lopez’s record sales, conversely, suggest a strong fan base and widespread 
popularity. She appears regularly on MTV and is often the subject of 
Hollywood gossip. Based on the sheer number of her economically-profitable 
endeavors, Lopez can be considered one of the Bronx’s greatest success sto­
ries. The only test Lopez has yet to withstand is that of time. While she 
remains the butt of many jokes, Jennifer Lopez is currently one of 
Hollywood’s most powerful players.
David Bowie has the unique ability to consistently reinvent himself while 
maintaining his original fan base and intriguing new listeners. Over decades,
Bowie’s music transformed along with his 
image. Whether as David Robert Jones 
(his birth name), Ziggy Stardust, the Thin 
White Duke, or David Bowie, he has been 
one of the most influential artists of our 
time. Though he has performed on stage 
and screen, his main career focus contin­
ues to be his art: singing and songwriting. 
Bowie has not limited himself to music, 
however.
Bowie’s best known film work is 
Labyrinth (1986), an adventure/fantasy 
film almost as eccentric as its star. The plot 
revolves around a young girl’s quest to res­
cue her brother from the king of the gob­
lins. A product of the creative mind of Jim 
Henson in collaboration with Bowie, 
Labyrinth is comprised of various musical 
numbers, puppet theatrics, and amusing 
dialogues, making it a cult classic.
“I don’t think that Bowie should do 
mainstream movies,” says Anthony 
Colaizzo, first-year business major, “I think that he should do more great 
movies like Labyrinth that introduce kids to rock. ‘Dance Magic’ is the best 
scene from Labyrinth. During that scene I just laugh and laugh and laugh. If 
David Bowie can’t repeat what he accomplished in Labyrinth, he was wise to 
stop making films.”
A key difference between the music and film industries is the “one-hit- 
wonder” phenomenon. In music, one-hit-wonders receive 15 minutes of 
fame and are soon forgotten. When a person makes a film that is well 
received and then bows out of the industry, it doesn’t have the same negative 
association. The film becomes a rarity and is coveted, whereas the music is 
thrown into a heap with many others and forgotten. Part of Labyrinth’s suc­
cess is due to the fact that it wasn’t followed up by a series of less successful 
ventures. Bowie struck while the iron was hot and knew when to stop.
Though brief, Bowie’s foray into film was an instant success. He continues 
to make music that is immeasurably creative. With a Madonna-like ability to 
reinvent himself, Bowie is a new artist each time he releases an album. While 
his acting career experienced a sudden burst of success, his music career con­
tinues to flourish.

Tabula Rasa now on A-F

Upstate at Laga

$8, all ages
Mr. Roboto Project 
Wednesday, October 30, 7pm

Bring out the Marshall stacks: Tabula Rasa 
signed with local record label A-F Records last 
Wednesday.
“It’s dark rock, heavier, with a little more 
riffing,” Tabula Rasa vocalist/guitarist Rob 
Spagiare said, describing the type of music the 
band plays. His is a modest evaluation, consid­
ering that the four musicians who comprise 
the band rock hard enough to please crowds at 
the Mr. Roboto Project and Club Laga, among 
other venues.
“It’s great to have people believe in what you 
want to do,” guitarist Andrew Grossman said 
of the band’s freshly-inked deal with A-F.
Tabula Rasa began with guitarists Spagiare 
and Grossman, both presently seniors at 
Carnegie Mellon, who have been friends since 
grade school and have played music together 
since high school. Two years ago, after the 
breakup of local band Ear to Ear, for which 
Spagiare played bass, Grossman and Spagiare 
joined with drummer Jeff Kopanic and 
bassist/vocalist Justin Campbell to form 
Tabula Rasa.
The band’s first show ever took place at the 
Frame gallery in the fall of 2000, when Tabula 
Rasa opened for a wrestling match that 
involved smashing ladders and tables, along 
with lots of barbed wire and tacks.
“Our friend Joe had this ‘hardcore Frame’ 
idea,” Spagiare explained. “We had only been 
together about a week.”
Though Tabula Rasa’s members cite a broad 
array of influences, from 1990s indie rock to 
classic rock, they all admire 1980s-90s 
Pittsburgh bands, specifically referencing a 
show at Chatham College’s REA Coffeehouse 
played by Shale and Jumbo that Spagiare and 
Grossman saw in their first year of high school.
“It was an amazing, loud barrage of music,” 
Spagiare said.
Tabula Rasa has done three east coast tours, 
often along with fellow Pittsburgh band Teddy 
Duchamp’s Army, and prefers the more wel­
coming atmosphere of houses as venues to the 
standoffishness of clubs. They also believe that 
the local music scene is one of Pittsburgh's best 
kept secrets.
“The problem with bands in Pittsburgh,” 
said Grossman, “is that they don’t leave 
[Pittsburgh] enough.”
The band members seem not to have any 
qualms about commercial success as long as 
they continue to have complete control over 
their music. They also choose to leave the pol­
itics that often define punk rock to their fan 
base.
“There’s already an underground [political] 
awareness,” Grossman said, adding that 
Tabula Rasa’s music is political in a personal 
sense.
“I don’t eat meat, but I’m not getting on my 
soapbox,” Campbell said.
Though three of the band’s members will 
soon graduate, the band anticipates intensive 
touring in the coming months and looks for­
ward to recording a new album during the 
winter with legendary underground producer 
J. Robbins.
Though the band salutes its independent 
roots and DIY venues like the Mr. Roboto 
Project, Campbell mentioned, “I don’t care if 
we’re [Led] Zeppelin as long as we’re doing 
what we want.”

Mushroomhead to play Laga on Wednesday
Take eight guys from the Midwest, put ’em in masks, inject a 
good dose of stage presence and unorthodox influences and of 
course you have Slipkn ... Mushroomhead. And on October 30, 
you can catch Cleveland’s favorite sons at Laga when they play a 
headlining show. Opening will be Shadow’s Fall, one of music’s 
newest attractions. Mixing odd time changes with precise guitar 
work, Shadow’s Fall is on track to capture the world’s attention.
Mushroomhead comes at you from the other end of the spec­
trum, if it can even be called that. At times, Faith No More, oth­
ers, The Cult, and even a bit of (Far Beyond Driven-era) Pantera, 
the ’Head are out to confuse. Or challenge, depending on who 
you ask. To be honest, I had a bit of a hard time getting into their 
newest, the re-released and updated XX.
Can you imagine piercing vocals over a piano backdrop? If 
anything, a barrage of different, or even divergent, influences
can serve as a distraction. It is a sticking point for me, and has 
probably hindered me when it came to reviewing multi-influ­
ence albums, but I feel that that too much of everything pleases 
no one.
Having said that, XX has its moments. There is some material 
that builds on the legacy of Mike Patton and Faith No More. The 
use of techno backbeats, while nothing new, finds its place com­
fortably with the ambience Mushroomhead attempts to set. And 
yes, there are definitely many heavy moments. Overall, a decent 
album, but not my cup of tea.
Till next time,

here once was a poor boy born in the humble village of Pittsburgh. He had a dream that there was a great 
treasure, in a far away land of palm trees, sunshine, and condensed matter research. He hitched rides 
across the continent, staying in youth hostels and surviving on gas station snack food and Diet RC Cola. He 
searched Berkeley day and night for the place he saw in his dream, but failed. Dejected and exhausted, he stum­
bled down a hallway and was grabbed on the shoulder by a grad student. “I know what you’re looking for,” 
she said. “I had a dream, too. It told me to find treasure in front of the elevators in a concrete buliding in west­
ern Pennsylvania. I wasted weeks of my life looking for it. Don’t waste any more of yours.” But our hero sim­
ply smiled, knowing his treasure was indeed waiting for him back home, in stacks of 150.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
A treatise on ducks, by Megan: (10th grade)
Okay, so this one time I went to the mall with my 
best gal friend Brenda, and we saw this TOTAL- 
LY hot guy standing there by the fountain, toss- J
ing in pennies in a way that said he totally knew 
he was hot. So we flipped our hair and started walking over toward 
him, when all of a sudden this duck comes up out of nowhere and 
starts squawking in our faces. And he’s all like, “Quackity quack 
quack look at me I’m a friggin duck!” And we’re all like, 
“Whatever, we just want to meet this totally hot guy.” So we brush 
past this annoying little duck and start to walk towards the guy 
again, but he’s gone! So we look around and see him on the 
OTHER side of the fountain, feeding bread crumbs to some other 
stupid duck. Aaaaargh! I hate ducks soooooo much.

NEWTON'S 
THREE EAWS OF 
GRADUATION
NEWTON'S 
THREE EAWS OF 
GRADUATION
Though famous for his seminal work in 
Mechanics, Isaac Newton's theories on the 
prediction of a doctoral graduation 
formulated while still a grad student at 
Cambridge remain his most important 
contribution to academia.
FIRST LAW
"A grad student in procrastination 
tends to stay in procrastination 
unless an external force is applied 
to it"
This postulate is known as the "Law of 
Inertia" and was originally discovered expe­
rimentally by Galileo four years before 
Newton was bom when he threatened to 
cut his grad student's funding. This resulted 
in a quickening of the student's research 
progress.
Galileo's observations were later perfected 
by Descartes through the application of 
"Weekly Meetings."
Before Galileo's time, it was wrongfully 
thought that grad students would rest only 
as long as no work was required of them 
and that in the absence of external forces, 
they would graduate by themselves.
(From Encyclopaedia Britannica)
motivation
This Law is a quantitative description of the 
effect of the forces experienced by a grad 
student. A highly motivated student may still 
remain in grad school given enough flexibility. 
As motivation goes to zero, the duration of 
the PhD goes to infinity.

diminish when you realize it is not written by your long­
term crush Fred Savage (of “Wonder 
Years” fame).
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): 
Realizing that you’re actually a pretty 
normal person will not make you feel 
like you belong, just less special and 
less valuable as an individual.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Although a hunter-gath- 
erer lifestyle may be appealing to you, there just aren’t 
that many squirrels in Pittsburgh.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22):
You will finally crack your 
infomercial product-purchasing 
addiction when you quit school to 
become an infomercial model and 
get products for free.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): You will stun and amaze 
philosophers and psychologists everywhere when you 
somehow reconcile living in the land of freedom and 
op.en spaces with working in a 4x4 halogen-lit plywood 
cubicle for 14 hours every day.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): On 
the upside, there’s no need for you to buy 
a Halloween costume, this year or ever.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): 
After your skilled performance in Simon 
Says, the preschoolers you are babysitting will finally 
accept you into their peer group.
SCORPIO (October 24 -
November 21): The US Northern 
border patrol welcomes you with 
open arms, as long as you’re not try­
ing to smuggle Kindereggs in from 
Canada.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - Grace Li/Art staff
December 21): You will be elated to 
realize that if you just stop entering your Schnauzer in 
dog shows, you’ll finally be more successful, famous, 
and loved than your pooch.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Sorry. 
Despite how much you may need the money, it’s proba­
bly not ethical to sell rides on your miniature seeing-eye 
pony.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): The word 
“hairball” will have new meaning and significance to 
you when the oversized owl outside your window regur­
gitates a fist-sized owl pellet after swallowing your suici­
dal cat.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Despite what the 
psychic tells you, you were not a starfish in a past life. 
Everyone knows they are the most popular fish, and 
your soul couldn't have changed that much over time.
