nology, regardless of creed in every 
possible, helpful and practical way, 
and to surround the students' with 
suich influences as shall help them 
to live clean lives and lead them 
into active church relationship ac­
cording to their faiths. Also to pro­
mote fellowship and aggressive Chris­
tian work by and for students and

SCIENCE SCHOOL 
HOLDS ASSEMBLY
“The fifteen years of development 
of the school are scarcely to be ¡men^ 
tioned in the same breath with what 
will be done in the next fifteen 
years.” This was the theme of the 
address to the students at the Science 
Assembly last Wednesday by Presi­
dent Hamerschlag. Since' “youth is 
the expression of faith” he urged us 
to do our part in the carrying, out of 
our part of our education and assured 
us that “every bit of educational pur­
pose has been concentrated in aiding 
the students in their studies.”
If we were to follow the advice of 
President Hamerschlag and “get out 
of bed each day with the 'belief that 
nothing done yesterday counts nearly 
as much as what you are going to do 
tomorrow” we would share in bringing 
faith, hope and courage into the 
world.
The election of R. B. Nation to the 
office of Student Council President; 
J. W. Byler, Senior Student Activities 
Board representative, and Hoenniger, 
a Plebe, as Science School nominee 
for cheer leader, took place.
ART JUNIOR CLASS ELECTS
At a' meeting of the Junior Class 
College of Fine Arts, on Thursday, the 
following officers were elected for the 
ensuing year:
President, A. S. Vincent; vice presi­
dent, Miss Chalmers; treasurer, E. O. 
Anderson; secretary, B. Wilson; sen­
ate representative, A. S. Vincent.
On the evening of Monday, October 
3, the Science Plebes held their first 
social event. A smoker, for the pur­
pose of meeting the men who were 
nominated for the Class officers, was 
held in the Union from seven until 
nine. The Plebe Jazz Band, first or­
ganization of its kind in the history 
of Carnegie Tech, furnished the mu­
sic for the occasion and was given 
three rousing cheers for its accom­
plishments. Jack Evans said they 
would be asked to play at the General 
Assembly if they kept up their good 
work.
M. Matter, Plebe chairman of the 
Smoker Committee, was the leader of 
the performance of the evening, acting 
as toastmaster, announcer, janitor 
and timekeeper. 1-Ie announced the 
speakers, calling first upon the can­
didates for president. H. B. Rossback, 
the first speaker, gave the class some 
idea for discussion and concluded 
with the usual “thanks.” D. A. Gard­
ner, who was the next speaker,.-'told 
the class that they were supposed to 
be the “best ever" and expressed his 
views on the future. W. V. Jones, 
after much -urging and persuasion, 
begged to announce that he^vas not a 
candidate, but was a nominee. He 
took his seat after, suggesting the 
advantage of another man for presi­
dent. H. Sn^ith expressed spine v.ery 
modest views on the subject of Fresh­
men. J. G. Bright told how good it 
was to be around when the Freshman 
football team scrimmaged with- the 
Varsity. IC. E. Gibson brought out 
several new ideas, all of which were 
worthy of consideration. He spoke 
about a Freshman Rifle Team, which 
is being considered by the Plebes and 
a Fencing,Team, the latter being en­
tirely new to Tech, but a. good sport. 
C. L. Atwood spoke about activities 
in a personal way as he is out for 
Cross Country. F. E. Williams gave 
some worthy views about the Fresh­
man Class. W. V. Flannagan spoke a 
word _of praise for the Band. T. P. 
Moessner showed us how Tech is 
thought of in distant parts of the 
country, especially in Connecticut. A.
B. Way was very emphatic in his de­
livery and had a good message .to de­
liver.
“Eats'’ were announced by the chair­
man and a mad rush for the coffee 
and doughnuts followed. With- the 
last crunch of doughnuts and the last 
sip of coffee the Smoker came to a 
close, marking the. first 'Science Plebe 
success, of which a great deal of credit 
is due Jack Evans’ untiring efforts 
and interest in the Plebe Class.

The Motor Transport Unit of the 
R. O. T. C. is scheduled for a prac­
tice convoy, Saturday, . October 15 
The destination is Little Washington, 
the scene of the Tech-W. & J. mix- 
up. Tech’s full flotilla« of trucks 
will be taken, and, in fact, anything 
that runs on wheels. The Motor 
Transport Unit numbers somewhat 
over a hundred students, and it is 
the desire of the Military Depart­
ment that enough trucks, will be in 
condition so that; the entire unit can 
be taken.
The present plans are to leave 
Pittsburgh at 8 a. m., October 15, 
and to arrive in Washington about 
noon. Tliis schedule will allow 
plenty of time to insure the safe ar­
rival of the convoy before the “kick- 
off,” whfcch is at 2:30.
It is thought that a detachment 
of the Signal Corps Unit will also 
be taken along. This unit will car­
ry a complete fleld wireless set, am' 
will send the returns of the game 
from Washington to Pittsburgh.
The convoy will be run according 
to M. T. <?. regulations, and will be 
under command of Major Gordon.
R. B. NATION 
PRES. ELECT
To Succeed F. I. Smith as 
Student Council Head. 
W. R. Mills Fills 
Council Vacancy
NEW CHEER LEADER
The Student Council elected R. Bv 
Nation to be its new president suc­
ceeding F. I. Smith. Nation has al­
ways been actively identified with 
the various activities at Carnegie and 
should prove a capable man for the 
position, which requires a large 
amount of work and forethought as 
well as experience. W. R. Mills, as 
vice president of the Science Senior 
•Class, will fill the Council vacancy, 
created by Mr. Nation's election to 
the presidency.
The matter of head cheer leader 
for CaVnegie was taken care «Catthis 
meeting. The nominees from the 
different schools were very carefully 
considered. The nominees were Ross 
Herts, Art's; “Ducky” Allen, Indus­
tries, and Hoenninger, Science.
It was decided that the head leader 
should be the one with the most ex­
perience and the ability to handle 
the cheering to the best advantage. 
Drilling of the-various cheer leaders 
was also emphasized. Hertz was 
elected to the head position and Allen 
and Hoenninger will be his assist­
ants.
Chairman Willard reported that ow­
ing to other productions and th^ rush 
of work that the Drama Department 
has it will be impossible to have a 
pUiy for Varsity Night. Two other 
plans have been proposed—one, that a 
vaudeville show be put on, the other, 
that a dance, with various stunts as 
features, 'be held.
The Dance Committee recommend­
ed that a couple of dance petitions be 
held over for further consideration. 
The fact that the petitions were pre­
sented by organizations which' could 
combine and hold one or two big 
dances rather than a number of 
mgller dances, not so successful, was 
the reason for withholding action at 
this time. The aim of the Council is 
to have, fewer dances and have them 
be successful, rather than a larger 
number which are only a partial suc­
cess.
ANNOUNCES COMMITTEE
The Schenley Danding Club was at 
a slight disadvantage last Saturday 
evening. They could just secure 
half of the hall room at the Schen­
ley. Earl Fuller’s "College Boys 
made a big hit with all who were 
present and they have been booked 
for the fifth of Novenvber.
There has been quite a 'bit of talk 
about who the committee is com­
posed of. It is a group of the boys 
from Tech and Pitt, including: 
Richard E. Smith, Carl Koelkebeck, 
Allan Irwin, -F. M. Ewing, Lloyd 
(Cy) Comfort, Thomas Holleran, 
Harold C. (Red) Godden, F. W. (Pie) 
Williams, Allan Wierman, William 
R. Mills and J. S. Criswell.
RADIO CLUB HAS GOOD START
The first meeting of the Radio Club 
held Wednesday evening in the Tower 
Room of Machinery Hall, was a big 
success. Thirty-six men were pres­
ent, and the membership is expected 
to exceed fifty. The following of­
ficers were elected:
President, J. Wan. Kauffman, Sci­
ence; vice president, J. Coleman, Sci­
ence; secretary, A. C. Peoples, Indus­
tries; treasurer, Edw. B. Davidson, 
Science.
The club has adopted the slogan, 
“Every man a Hcens6 hy April.’’
Classes in theory'and code are be­
ing held one day a week for this pur­
pose. All Arts, Science and Industries 
men interested in radio are invited to 
attend the meetings and classes of in­
struction.
The next meeting of the class in 
code and theory will be held in the 
Signal Corps Room, Machinery Hall 
tower at 4:30 p. m., Wednesday, Oc­
tober 12. The meeting will be in the 
evening of the same day at 7:30 p. 
m., and will be an open meeting. All 
men interested are invited and urged 
to attend. The Wireless Club men 
used to be one of the strongest or­
ganizations of students at Tech. A 
good membership will make it better 
than ever now. No previous knowl­
edge or interest necessary. Come 
around!
* Should any student after sav-
* ing State .stamps, find it iucon- ¦*
* venient to go to the game, the
* graduate manager will refund the *!• 
*1* money invested except twenty *
cents for tj\e cost of folder and# * 
*:• stamps. It is hoped tliat more * 
%- students will avail themselves of * 
•I* the opportunity of saving 'and * 
*!? going on the trip.
FIRST A. I. E. E. 
MEETING WED.
Over Fifty Members Present 
at First Meeting
What was probably one of the best 
attended and most spirited meeting 
of the Carnegie Tech vBrcihch of the 
American Institute of Electrical En­
gineers was held Thursday evening 
in Room 11 Machinery Hall.
About fifty students of the electri­
cal department heard a very interest­
ing and entertaining talk by Prof. I-I. 
S. Hower, head of the Physics De­
partment. He told of his experiences 
encountered while on a recent tour of 
Europe and those who missed hearing 
him are minus a great deal of knowl­
edge regarding the present conditions 
in Europe.
Prof. Hower’s talk was of course 
the feature of the evening, and if the 
other speakers who are to he present 
at the future riieetings of the A. I. E. 
E. can hold the interest of the list­
eners as well as he, the attendance 
is bound to include the entire Elec­
trical Department in a short while.
Routine business including the elect 
ttop of an executive committee, was 
concluded hy short talks by Electrical 
Department faculty, including Prof. 
Work and Mr. Porter. Prof. Donnel, 
permanent secretary of the organiza­
tion, explained to new members the 
aims and .benefits ot the A.-I. .12. E., 
both locally and as a national organi­
zation.
Refreshments and a social hour 
concluded the first meeting and every­
one there will surely assure thoso not. 
present of a good time at the next 
regular meeting, the first Thursday 
in November. Members of the three 
upper classes of the Electrical De­
partment are urged to join at the next 
meeting and derive some of the bene­
fits of the A. I. E. E., while a Studput 
at Carnegie Tech.

STANDARD ARMY COURSE
The Military Department has been 
instrumental in assisting in the de­
served promotion of Mr. R. "B. Am­
brose to the grade of professor. This 
promotion has just taken place and 
it is understood that the event de­
cided this promotion occurred as fol­
lows :
There was recently a board of of­
ficers convened at iCamp Holabird, 
Md., for the purpose of selecting a 
course for all the Motor Transport 
Units at the different colleges in the 
United States. Each college which 
had a Motor Transport Unit was call­
ed upon- to submit a copy of their 
course, and the Military Department 
at Carnegie Tech submitted the course 
used at this institution in compliance 
with the above directions. This course 
had been carefully worked out by Mr. 
Ambrose in consultation with Major 
Cordon- and after comparing the dif­
ferent courses at all the institutions 
it was found by this board at Hola­
bird, that the course prepared by Mr. 
Ambrose was so excellent that it was 
adopted for all institutions with .prac­
tically no change. Mr. Ambrose de­
serves great credit for preparing a 
course that has now ibecome standard 
everywhere.
A. 1. E. E. HOLDS ELECTION
The election of officers • of the 
Carnegie Tech branich of the Ameri­
can Institute of Electrical Engineers 
was held Tuesday noon in Room 100, 
Science. Edw. A. Brand was elected 
chairman for the y??ar with W. A. 
Andrews as vice chairman, Harold 
Bryan as secretary, and A. T. .John­
ston, treasurer.
A moti/on reducing the annual dues 
from $1.50 fto $1.00 was passed and 
will remain in effect provided a suf­
ficient number of students join the 
organization. Membership Is open 
to the three upper classes of the 
elebtrlcal engineering department 
andw offers everyone "an opportunity 
of hearing some of the best speakers 
of the electrical world in this section 
Of the country.
When Saturday rolls around, the Carnegie Tech campus will be like 
unto a morgue, for on that date, it has been decreed by the omnipotent and 
most hpnorable jinx of football that every loyal' son of the Plaid will depart 
from the lair of the Maggie Murplis, and bend his way towards Little Wash­
ington, the home of that football team of Washington & Jefferson College.
It is there that the powers that bo have decided that the annual Wash-Jeff-
Carnegie Tech football game will be contested.
“On to Washington;” “Beat W. & J.;’’ “3,000 Tech rooters to Washing­
ton.” These are just a few of the slogans that Tech has adopted. What does 
it all mean? In short, it simply means that if you’re a’ loyal Tech man, and
>not a mere student, you’ll be in’ that 
Tech Special' to Little Washington. 
It means that every single man who 
loves Carnegie Tech will be down in 
Washington on the afternoon of Oc­
tober 15 th.
Apd talk about your fun, well, if 
you go this time, you’ll never miss 
another trip like it! Just listen to 
thoso that made that trip to Cornoll 
back yonder two years ago! Just lis­
ten to thoso that made that trip to 
Wheeling last year! Also that trip to 
Little Washington two years ago! It 
rained like sin on that trip to Wash­
ington, but wo had a grand and glori­
ous time. It was cold as the very 
north ipplo Itself In Wheeling, but a 
groat time was had by all novortho- 
less. Wo lost both times, but that 
didn’t dampen the enthusiasm. Down 
al, Whoollng, we paraded tho town so 
strenuously after the game, that wo 
had the towns folks thinking that we 
had won the gamo. We may win, or 
wo may loflo, but that Tech spirit 
nover dies.
So, wo will all got on that Special 
for Llltlo Washington this Saturday, 
and go down tihoro with the custo­
mary Tech spirit, and will have the 
time of our lifo, and incidentally give 
that Tech football t\>am tl)e support it 
deserves. We’ll just naturally drown 
tho Wash-Joff cheers when wo start 
our cheering.
Students’ tickets 'will cost you 75o 
if bought In the Graduate Manager's 
olllco before you loavo tho campus. 
In buying this student tlclcot, your 
registration card must bo shown. This 
is a saving of sovcnty-fiv6 cents, be­
cause the gonoral admission will be 
$1.50 to students of Tech or otherwise, 
II' you fall to buy your tlclcot at the 
Graduate Manager’s ollloe. Tho faro 
on tho special train, and on tho spe­
cial only, will bo $1.80 per round trip. 
Special will leave tho Union Station 
(Pennsylvania Railroad) at 12:30 p. 
in., and will aVrlvo In Washington at 
1:80*1?. m. Reserved soais will bo 
$2.50, and can bo obtained at tho of­
fice of Graduate Manager. Upon ro- 
cipt of checks through mall, tlckots 
win bo mailed.
As an extra inducement, tho omni­
present Carnegie Tech band will be 
along to liven the trip up. It will lead 
a parade through .the town of Wash­
ington, starting tit Church street and 
ending at the football field. Make 
this parade the longest parade of Tech 
students ever con costed together!

Tho first meeting of tho Student 
Activities Board for tho school year, 
192.1-1922, was hold on Wednesday, 
October 5, at 7:30 p. m„ in Dean 
Tarbell’s office. Miss Priscilla Al­
lison was appointed acting secretary. 
No election was hold at this mooting 
because of most of tho boanLmombors 
being new and It was thought advis­
able to .hold it over until tho noxt 
meeting, which is the third Wednes­
day of tho month.
Minutes of the last mooting on May 
18 were road and approved.
Old Business The mtotter of tho 
Carnegie Institute of Technology ban- 
nor was again taken up but was tabled 
until the noxt mooting.
New ^Business—Tho treasurer's re­
port was road and accepted. An ex­
planation regarding tho select ion of a 
man to fill the position of Graduate 
Mnnagoi\of Activltlba was mado, blit 
owing to tho liojivy schedule of tho 
.non interested, who’hold fellowships, 
no ono has boon selected so far; it,Is 
Hoped that a man may be found soon 
who can fill this position as It is of 
groat Importance to the Activities 
Board in carrying on its vast amount 
of business. Doan Tarboll explained 
tho '¡budget for tho coming your and 
also mado a. statement In regard to tho 
night school students paying -tho stu­
dent activities fee. Mr. Griffin again 
brought up tho question of tho Chess 
Club, but It was tabled until tho .noxt 
meeting. Mr. B. II. Johnson, repre­
senting tho Y. M A., asked that 
tho Board lend tho Y. M. C. A. enough 
furniture to put in tliolr club room 
until they can secu’re same. One hun­
dred dollars was authorized to be paid 
to the Y. W. C. A. as a part of their 
•budget amount for this ypar. Tho 
Tartan request that one thousand dol­
lars be given now as a part of their 
budget, was granted.
The next meeting of tho Board will 
be October 19.
FIRST PLAY IN ARTS 
THEATER TONIGHT
The first produoLion of the year in 
the Theater of the College of Fine 
Arts, as announced previously, will 
be that of “The Song of Songs,” 
which will be given^ its initial per­
formance tonight. The .play is "from 
Ulie pen of Hubert Osborne, although 
all of the dialogue is that of the 
Bible, being taken verbatim from 
The Song1 of Solomon and Eoles- 
iasstes.
The idea, of using this theme for 
an elaborate spectacle^play, which is 
what the production will be, first 
came to Mr. Osborne when he was 
staying in a little hotel in New Eng­
land last summer. The only reading 
matter to be had, it appears, was a 
Gideon Bible, such as this society
places in hotel bedrooms. In looking
through a copy, he was impressed 
with the .possibilities of the Song ot 
Solomon, dramatically. The plan 
gradually shaped itself in his mind, 
until the completed whole as we shall 
see lit on the Dramatic: Department 
stage was evolved here this fall. 
The production is In four scenes, 
with spoken prologue and Inter­
ludes.
The setting for the play Is one
of the most beautiful ever seen not 
only here, but In any Broadway 
production. It represents a level 
plateau on the hilltop of Mt. Leba­
non, overlooking the valley of tho 
vineyards and Jerusalem In tho dis­
tance. The whole Is, highly keyed In

ON TO WASHINGTON
The irst real football clash ol1 the season for Carnegie Tech will 
lie staged at Little AVashington against W. & .1. It will be the first 
game this season, when cheering will eonnt ancl the student body on 
the side lines means a lot. It will be the first chance the student 
body has had to show the team that they arc back of them and will 
do their utmost to bring victory home.
It has been customary to send a train of rootérs and the “omni­
present” band to W. & J. to “cheer” them up a bit. This year, 
with conditions differing, every man must go to AV. & J. They still 
remember the 6-0 score and they want, this year, victory, decisive vie-' 
tory at any cost. The trip will be a remembrance worth your money 
if you have spent any. It does not matter much how you get there, 
the essential thing is to get there. The football team needs you, 
your Alma Mater needs you and you owe it to yourself. Be there 
and after the game we’ll show Little Washington how to count the 
score.
Happenings on the Campus
TECH NIGHT AT CALVARY1" , —.....— '
Tech night at the Calvary church is not an Episcopalian affair. 
It is a Carnegie Tech night, a night when Carnegie men and women 
can get together, hear some interesting speakers, get to know, each 
other better and know that folks, other than those connected with 
the school, are interested in the welfare of tho Carnegie Tech stu­
dent body.
The affair will be Carnegie Tech to the core. It is one of the 
events of tho year, and it bcliooves every Carnegie Tech man and. 
woman lo take part in Tech night at Calvary.

INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY
The regular assembly of Industries 
students last Wednesday, was one 
of the beet ever held, both in re­
spect to attendance and interest. 
Room 104 was packed to capacity. 
President Godden opened tbe meet­
ing by announcing that 'President 
J-Iamemchlag would speak. , The 
president spoke first of the attitude 
of a student. He referred to the 
one way, of looking backward, crit­
icizing what has been done and be­
moaning past mistakes; and then 
showed that the student should cen­
ter his vision on the future, and by 
developing. selfi-confidence strive to 
make the future as lull of opportun­
ities as could be deBired. president 
Hamerschlag announced that scholar­
ship standards of the Industries are 
now .on a par with Science, and that 
any feeling of differences between 
the colleges i6 unfounded and fool­
ish. As the whole address was cen­
tered on student attitudes, he next 
made a comparison of the student 
and the football man. To many 
students give up when they are only 
half "licked;" they shouldl take an 
example from the football team in 
the Geneva game. They didn't ge< 
across in the first half, but they 
came back strong in the third quar 
ter and scored. That’s what lie 
likes to see a student do. “DonM 
quit when only half lUcked!’’
The assembly was highly pleased 
with the address and cheered heart­
ily at the close.
A highly entertaining feature of 
the assembly was presented by fiv- 
Plebes up for offenses against rules 
One drank a cup of milk using a 
dropper, another ate weiners dang 
ling from strings, the remaining 
three were merely on display, and 
had duties outside of assembly.
The following officials were nomin­
ated and voted on:
Representative to Student Council— 
A1 Irwin 
McCarty 
D. F. Cassidy 
Ed Nash 
Industries Candidates for Cheer 
leader—

A1 Erwin and Allen were chosen

It was also announced that peti 
tlons for exemption -from regula 
tlons would have'to be presented b. 
fore October 10, and accopanied by 
evidence of having served a year 
elsewhere, in order to receive con 
slderatlon by the board. Federa 
Board men are exempt.
made Teknon possible.
After the supper was served the 
club adjourned to the business of the 
evening. Minutes were read from the 
last meeting of last year, and the 
treasurer's report showed a fine finan­
cial status with which to start the 
¦work for the coming year. A commit­
tee was appointed to make any neces- 
saiy suggestions for the constitution.
Dr. Kerr took up the question of the 
course of study, a text book was 
chosen and the assignments made for 
next week. It is worth the while for 
every member to keep in mand the 
great privilege of being one of the 
Teknon Club, and get over there every 
Thursday evening, promptly at six 
o’clock.

the Style Show might be held at 
11:30.

At the Y. W. C. A. cabinet meeting 
last Wednesday it was decided to 
change the date of the Y. W. meetings 
from Monday to Wednesday. The 
change was made on account of the 
Student Vespers meetings, which are 
to be on Monday at 4:30. In view of 
the fact that both organizations are 
working toward the same end it was 
thought that everything possible 
should be done to co-operate with the 
Vespers.
The program for the cabinet meet­
ings was also decided upon. The 
book, “How Jesus Met Life Ques­
tions/' is to be studied and discussed 
in the ’meetings.
RIFLE CLUB AT M. M. C.
The promptness with which the 
girls at Margaret Morrison have been 
signing up for the rifle club has sur­
prised more than a few. The Tech 
Rifle Club has been very kind in of­
fering the girls the range and rifles 
and their generosity is the “talk of 
the town.”
'When some of these rifle sharks get
into good trim, teams will be organ­
ized and matches begun. Everyone- 
is enthusiastic, and it ought to be a. 
great' success.
M. M. C. TEA ROOM
The Margaret Morrison Tea Room, 
under the supervision of Miss Smith_ 
and the class in Tea Room Manage­
ment;, opened Friday afternoon. Tea 
and sandwiches—though the menu 
will vary—will be served from 3:30 
to 5 every Friday afternoon.
FORBES HALL DANCE
One of the biggest and best dances . 
ever given in the house was staged 
at Forbes Hall Friday night. The 
house was beautifully decorated for 
the first fall dance, the idea bein& 
carried out in leaves and flowers. Over 
fifty couples attended the dance, and 
everyone reported a very good time.
The music, was furnished by Steve 
Kovack’s peppy four. A great deal 
of credit for the success of the dance 
must be given the committee in 
charge, assisted of course, by a bat­
talion of willing Freshmen.

out, it presents a constantly chang­
ing picture of wonderful beauty. 
The set was designed by Alexander
Wyckoff, and executed by him and. 
Mr. Gaither with the assistance of 
the students.
The musical setting which will be 
used throughout the action of the 
“iSong of Songs,” and which is by 
no means the least important part of 
the whole, has been arranged by 
Burdette Kappes, with the guidance 
of Mr. Osborne. Matt Frey will play

most part by Mr. Wyckoff,. and exe­

dents, and wonderully colorful and 
suggestive of the wealth and! splendor 
of the Court of Solomon. The pro­
cession which accompanies his en­
trance is more impressive than any­
thing yet, seen here.
Taken as a whole, the production 
will be, from a standpoint of beauty 
and technical skill, a fitting one 
with which to open the season in the 
Arts Theater. The difficult problem 
will be in living up to the standard 
set in the rest ofl the plays of the 
season.

FIRST MEETING RIFLE CLUB
On Thursday, September 29, the 
Carnegie Tech Rifle Club held its 
first meetiing of the year. Plans for 
the present year were discussed and 
the following officers were elected1:
President—“Pete” Thompson.
Vice President—C. Harwood.
Secretary—C. H. Grimm.
Treasurer—"Whity” Wolters.
Executive Officer—Woolley.
Much interest was evidenced by 
the- large attendance,’ the Freshmen 
being especially well represented and 
it was predicted that new material 
would pass the hundred mark.
The club is very anxious to get in 
touch with any new men who might 
be interested in this branch of sport. 
Another meeting will be held in 
Room GO, Science, on Thursday even­
ing for the purpose of admitting 
new members and for the renewal 
of memberships.
A challenge from the Yale Univer­
sity Rifle Team has been received 
by Manager O'Connor for February 
21. Unquestionagly the Yale team 
is the best in the country and it. 
will certainly mean much for Tech 
to take them over. Arrangements 
are also- being made for matches 
with Harvard, Penn, Princeton, Col­
gate, Ohio State, Georgetown and 
Columbia. It might also be possible 
to hold matches with Oxford and 
Cambridge.

THAT W. & J. GAME
At last, the game which every Techite has looked forward to is about 
to be played. The strong Red and Black eleven of Washington and Jeffer­
son is primed for the game and the sentiment around the Washington school 
is ‘‘Beat Tech if anybody.” The opposition to be met by the Plaid eleven 
is great; probably they will face no more formidable foe on the gridiron 
this year.
Every person at Tech will remember the game of last year when the 
Skibo machine defeated the Red and Black, in a hard game. 6-0. The cele­
bration followed for several days few will forget. It may be predicted that a 
greater celebration and parade will take place if Tech again comes out on 
top. Don’t fail to be on hand to support the team when it comes out on the 
Washington field Saturday.

ROBERTSON AGAIN STARS
The name "Wallie” Steffen is a by- 
word around the Tech campus and 
among all the supporters of Tech’s 
football teams.
"Wallie’s” career as a football 
player began while he was attend­
ing the North Division High School, 
Chicago, where he played four years. 
His feats of the gridiron made him 
the star of the city in his day.
He entered the University of Chi­
cago in 1905 and continued his ath­
letic career as a player through 1908, 
when he captained the Maroon eleven. 
He was selected as the All-American 
quarter back by Walter Camp that 
year.
In 1007 and 1908 Chicago Avas the 
Big Ten champion. The fine gener­
alship and brilliant open field running 
of ‘‘Wallie” were important factors 
in the success of Coach iStagg’s team.
Steffen was a track man also and 
held the World’s record for the 60- 
yard hurdles from 1908 to 1912.
Ho is at present a member of the 
City Council of Chicago, a position 
he has held for the last six years.
The Chicago Tribune says: ‘Tie has 
stood for years behind every measure 
that meant civic betterment, a leader 
in the council, whose squareness 
nas never challenged.”
STATE STAMP CAMPAIGN
What’s wrong, Tedli? Manager 
I-Iaaren states that the Penn State 
Stamp Campaign is liable to be a 
total failure unless immediate sup­
port is given. Sales of stamps in the 
last week have been so small as to 
be negligible. Even the free trips 
offered by the 'Alumni have failed to
On Tech Field, fairly soaked with 
water, and amid showers of a cold 
drizzling rain, the Carnegie Tech 
football team overwhelmed the Pres­
byterians from Westminster College 
by the large score of 42 to 0, for 
tbe men from New Wilmington. The 
matter of ‘‘who will win” was never 
the question in doubt except for 
perhaps one or two seasons after the 
initial kick-off; rather, the question 
was ‘‘how much.” Westminister was 
far inferior to Tech in every de­
partment of the game, and it is only 
the inclement weather that kept the 
score as low as it Vas, for it must 
mje admitted that with a faster field, 
tihe Tech baeks, aided by the power­
ful driving power of the forwards, 
would have driveu forward at a 
much greater rate and velocity than 
it was .possible on the slippery and 
treacherous field of mud1.
The Tech field-.generals as a rule 
•held to straight football, not disclos­
ing any of their wares for fear of 
the watichful eyes of Wash-Jeff 
scouts, andi again for the simple rea­
son that there was no need of any 
thing extra being put forth. But at 
times, as evidenced by two touch­
downs the open game was resorted 
to, and with wonderful success, 
when "Red” Goddon snatched two 
perfectly thrown forward passes out 
of the air, and laid it neatly behind 
the Westminister goal line.
The game was replete with thrills 
and for that reason, was most inter­
esting to the spectator, for after all 
it said and done, the avenugo specta­
tor loves to see a fast back dash 
around an end for a long run. 
Time and Lima again Robertson 
would, behind good Interference, 
break loose for pretty gains around 
the ends, as would Weir man also.
Rolbertson. proved himself, as last 
Saturday against Geneva, the out­
standing star. "Red” Goddon wan 
also a most brilliant, luminary in 
both offensivgo and defensive. Hite 
frrahhinir of forward passes was won­
derful/ His brealdmg-up of Westmin­
ister plays was just as wonderful. In 
line plunging, Mills and Brumbaugh 
and Anderson and Sawyer shared 
with each other the glory of gaining 
through the lines, with perhaps the 
greater cretlit going to Mills . and 
Brumbaugh.
In the line, as usual the whole lino 
performed in wonderful style,, show­
ing vast improvement over last week, 
when the Geneva forwards broke 
through time and time again to 
smear the Tech attacks right in the 
bud. But along this line, much 
credit cannot be taken by the 'Tech 
line, for the Westminster line was 
woefully weak, and the team that 
could not break through them or 
hold them would surely rank as 
much below normal. ,
The six Tech touchdowns came in 
rapid succession, two being made in 
each of the first three quarters. 
The firsti came as a direct result of 
goodi end runs of Robertson and ter­
rific 1 in e-bucks of Mills and Ander­
son, Anderson carrying it over. The 
second came as a result of a perfect 
forwardl pass Anderson to Godden, 
as< lie stood hack of the goal line. 
Brumbaugh and Robertson were re­
sponsible for the < third score, 
‘‘Brummie" tuking it over. Just be­
fore the first half ended Brumbaugh, 
Robertson and Anderson combined 
their drivos for the fourth trip over 
the Westminster goal, “Andy’’ taking 
It over.
Tho second* half started with prac­
tically an ontlro new toam oh tho 
field for both Tdch and Westminster. 
Scoring was again resumed soon 
aftor, whon Andorson ropeatod ltte 
forward passing game by a. perfoct 
threw to Goddon. Later towards tho 
end of tliila quarter, Bruimbaugh again 
carried tho ball ovor for a final 
touchdown, making a grand total of 
42 points, for, alitor each touchdown, 
Comfort easily kicked goal. Inci­
dentally this makes ’ thirteen out of 
thilrtoon for "Cy" this soason.

Tech will get her first real battle of 
tho season, for heretofore Tech has 
always been conceded tho victory be­

team play of any team in the country.

alumni. And, on the side of the af- 
fiair which has its location right here 
in the Schenley Park, is that deter­
mination to repeat, to do all they can, 
by pure grit, fight, determination, and 
good coaching, to prove to the world 
at large that that victory of last sea­
son was not a fluke, but a well-earned 
victory, and to settle once and for all 
times, the fact that the Carnegie Tech 
football team is entitled to a placé in 
the limelight of football throughout 
the country.
Washington and Jefferson has 
placed their football prospects under 
a new regime, that of Coach "Greasy” 
Neale, and his faithful follower, Kelli- 
son. Coach Neale is one of the best 
coaches in the game, and with the 
material at hand down at Little Wash­
ington should turn out a championship 
team, and from the scores of games ex. 
far, one can not help but judge that 
he has done just that. So far, Wash- 
Jeff has taken Into camp two strong 
teams, and one fairly strong team. 
Bethany was 'downed 14-0; Bucknell 
24-0, and last Saturday West Virginia 
Wesleyan fell,to tho largo scoro of 54- 
0., This gives Wash-Jeff a total score 
of 92 points. So far Tech has scored 
91 points against their opponents. But 
this one point means much more than 
it. seems for the caliber of. teams as 
played and defeated by Washington 
and Jefferson are far above the cali­
ber of teams as played by Carnegie 
Tech.
"Bob” Wadell, assistant to the 
Graduate Manager and to Coach Stef­
fen, is an experienced football player 
and coach.
He played quarter back and did the 
punting for the Peabody High School. 
Pittsburgh, eleven for three years. 
From there he went to Bucknell. 
where he continued his career as a 
quarter back. He played three years 
at Bucknell and captained the team 
in 1919. He also played basket ball 
and baseball.
Last year he assisted C. W. P. Rey­
nolds in coaching the Bucknell 
griders.

‘Judge for Yourself -
Vwww PU
With' the increased number of mem­
bers in the Alumni Federation, it was 
thought advisable séveral years ago 
to organize clans from the various 
cities where ten or moi’e graduates 
and former students had located. The 
purpose of this walj to bring about the 
closer fellowship among alrnimi, for­
mer students and friends of the insti­
tute! At the present time 18 clans 
have been organized in towns and 
cities from Massachusetts to Virginia 
and as far West as Chicago.
Organization of Clans
It is suggested:
1. That the Clans be simple in or­
ganization.
2. That the Clans/ be representative 
and all students of the different de­
partments and colleges of the Insti­
tute shall be cordially welcomed and 
shall take part.
3. That monthly meetings be held 
if possible, so as to keep up interest 
in the Clan.
4. Report meeting dates and results 
of meetings to the Alumni office for 
Tartan and Alumnus publication.
5. Report election of officers and 
all important questions to the Alumni 
office as a record for our files.
C. 'Send to the Alumni office at least 
twice a, year (fall and spring), a com­
plete iróster of your clan.
Suggested Activities
1. Bring, about closer fellowship 
among the Alumni, rormer students 
and friends of the Institute.
2. Induce the best student in the 
local high school to coifie to the Insti­
tution. Perhaps you can furnish a 
scholarship as an Inducement.
3. Persuade the J>est college gradu­
ate you know to com«! for post gradu­
ate work.
4. Establish a lectureship associa­
tion, providing occasional lectures, 
open to the general public, by prom­
inent members of the faculty and 
other eminent men on topics of gen­
eral interest.
5. Hold at least two meetings of 
all members each year at which af­
fairs of the Institute may be discussed 
with someone from the Institute if 
possible.
G. Promote literary and scientific 
pursuits and matters of kindVed inter­
est to members.
7. Co-operate with the general 
alumni campus week committee and 
make Tech your home during that 
period.
The Alumni Federation Will Help
The iClan 'Committee of the Alumni 
Federation offers its assistance in the 
organization of Clans.
Would you like to have represen­
tatives of tjie Institute visit youi‘ city 
and describe to you what is going on 
at the Institute and what the Clans 
at other places are doing, thinking 
and saying? If you would, form a Car­
negie Institute of Technology Clan, 
make it representative of the Institute 
in your community and write to the 
chairman of the Clan Committee, care 
the Alumni office, telling what sort of 
a meeting you can arrange and' ap­
proximately when you would like to 
have it. This committee will en­
deavor to have a representative at­
tend your meeting.
