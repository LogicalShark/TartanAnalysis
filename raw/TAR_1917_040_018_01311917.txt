PLANS LAID FOR SECOND SEMESTER
New England Club Plans 
Many Interesting Events
Last Thursday evening the Newr 
-England Club forfeited a game of bas­
ketball to the Southern Club owing to 
the fact that some of the New Eng­
land men were unable to play.
All the New England plebes are re­
quested to meet in the Union on 
Thursday afternoon at 4:30. The 
president will discuss some important 
club activities with these men and 
every man is urged to be present.
Considerable activity has been man­
ifested the past few weeks, and the 
Executive Committee has formulated 
some very interesting plans which will 
keep the members on the jump during 
the second semester.
PITT-TECH SMOKER WILL BE FEB. 17
Plans for Joint Affair Under 
Way—Pitt Weekly Com­
pliments Tech Upon Last 
Year’s Affair
POEMS1 PUBLISHED
Tn regard to the Pitt-Tech Smoker, 
which was announced in the publica­
tions of both institutions last week, 
the.Pitt Weekly has this to say: “Sat­
urday, February 17, has been deter­
mined as the evening for the Pitt- 
Tech Smoker, upon which the Senate 
Committee is now working. After 
consideration of several ..dates, the 
seventeenth was decided upon as be­
ing most suitable for both student 
bodies. As far as is nowr known there 
are no conflicting affairs in either 
school; this should assure a large 
turnout, especially since the an­
nouncement is being made early 
enough for everyone to reserve the 
date.
“The Smoker will be held in Trees 
Gymnasium and an invitation is ex­
tended to the faculties and student 
bodies of both schools to be present. 
The Smoker given in the Union build­
ing by Tech last year was in every 
way most successful, and it is the in-
I tention of the Senate to arrange a 
| creditable program that will do jus­
tice to Pitt, and at the same time 
show our appreciation of the efforts 
! of Tech in beginning such joint func- 
! tions.”
The extensive preparations which 
Pitt is making for this affair are evi­
denced by the careful subdivision of 
their committee. E. R. Ames is gen­
eral chairman, and sub-committees 
are as follows: Program, Armstrong
j and Miller.; reception, Forman; dec­
oration, Haudenshield, and refresh- 
mants, Mays. This committee has re­
quested the clubs and organizations 
of their school to keep this date free 
as far as possible; undoubtedly the 
organizations at Tech will do the 
same.
Men in Industries Do All the Work From the Drawings t0 
the Assembling
The Stratford Company, publishers, 
of Boston, Mass., are preparing for 
publication an Anthology of the best 
poetry written by American college 
:students during the present academic 
year and are sending out notices to 
the various colleges throughout the 
country requesting all students who 
wish to submit poems for possible 
publication to send in their manu­
scripts.
Last year there were sixty colleges 
represented in this book and it is the 
wish of the publishers to secure poems 
from many more this year.
The following notice has been re­
ceived by the school:
"We are now preparing for publi­
cation an Anthology of the best 
poetry written by American college 
students during the present academic 
year (191G-17). This Anthology will 
be uniform with our College Anthol­
ogy for 1915-16 and like the above 
Anthology, will have an introduction 
by, .William S. Braitliwaite, poetry 
editor of the Boston Transcript.
All students who wish to submit 
poems for possible inclusion in this 
Anthology are requested to send their 
manuscripts to Henry T. Schnittkind, 
Ph.D., care the Editorial Department 
of the Stratford Company, Publishers, 
32 Oliver street, Boston, Mass.
No poems submitted later than May 
15, 1917, will be considered.
For some time past the students of 
the Industries school have been at 
work making an engine lathe. This 
machine was completed in time to be 
on exhibition in the machine shop on 
Carnegie* Day.
Upon several occasions, , before the I 
founding of a machine construction i 
course, Mr. Hepburn suggested that 
the students build some sort of a mn- J 
chine. However, when various com- j 
panies were asked to lend drawings, 
the request was turned down. After i 
the Machine Construction course was,
inaugurated under Prof. Leeds, he 
suggested that the students make the 
drawings and patterns and do the 
casting, forge and machine work. 
Dean Connelly heartily approved of 
this and the machine was started.
The machine shown above is four­
teen inches by five foot, and in its 
building only the best of commercial 
practice was used. The lathe is com­
plete in every way and reflects much 
credit upon the students and instruct­
ors of the Machine Construction 
course. The lathe will bo put into 
active service in the machine shop.

PLAYS OF LAST WEEK WILL BE REPEATED
On Friday and Saturday nights of

Department will repeat the plays 
given last week. They are Oscar 
Wilde’s "The Importance of Being

INSPECTION TRIPS TAKENjeT WEEK
Electrical Engineers Will Visit 
Niagara Falls and Buffalo
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CLUB ELECTS OFFICERS
The Building Construction Club, at 
a meeting held last Thursday after- j 
noon, elected the following officers to j 
serve during the second semester:
O. P. Kneuer, president; Donnell D. 
Reed, vice president; N. Tramonte, j 
secretary and treasurer. I
The governors of Kentucky, Virgin­
ia and Tennessee, the three states 
whose borders meet at Cumberland 
Gap, will deliver addresses of wel­
come to the notable men and women 
who are expected to attend the me­
morial celebration at Lincoln Me­
morial university at Cumberland Gap, 
Tenn., February 10, 11 and 12.
Following the custom of making an 
inspection trip away from Pittsburgh 
every two years, the Senior and Jun­
ior Electricals will visit Erie, Buf­
falo and .Niagara Falls next week. It 
is expected that about twenty-five stu­
dents together with Prof. Dennison 
will make the trip. It wras at first 
thought that the war in Europe would 
spoil the Niagara trip, because all 
Canadian powerhouses are protected 
by military guard and barbed wire 
entanglements. Philadelphia and 
New York City with a study of recent 
railroad electrifications was proposed 
as a substitute. The lure of Broadway 
was strong, but the expense of such 
a trip were too great, so after a little 
investigation it was found that there 
was enough to be seen on the Amer­
ican side at Niagara Falls.
Permission has been received to 
visit nine or more different places, 
among which might be mentioned 
Erie Works of the General Electric 
Company, Erie County Electric Com­
pany, United States Light and Heat 
Cfompanl, Carborundum Works, Inter­
national Paper Company, Hydraulic 
Power Company and the Shredded 
Wheat Works.
Well, did you read the article in last 
week’s Tartan which modestly ex­
plained the rare delights in store for 
those fortunate individuals who line 
up for a copy of the 1917 Thistle? If 
not, make all haste to borrow your 
nearest neighbor’s copy and acquaint 
yourself with the facts. That 1917 
Thistle certainly is—but hold, time 
and space do not permit further elu­
cidation.
The board wishes to ask a special 
favor of everyone whose picture is to 
appear in the book, and that is to have 
your picture taken promptly. It is 
very important that all pictures be in 
as soon as possible. Fred L. Sharpe, i 
who has charge of this division, | 
wishes to impress this as strongly as , 
possible on all concerned, and we feel 
certain that all will give it their at­
tention.
Remember that the Thistle wishes 
to give as many personal features as 
possible and any snap-shots, school 
happenings of interest, etc., will be 
j welcome. Just drop them in any of 
the little green boxes in the various 
buildings, or hand them to a member 
of the board.
But, above all else, don’t neglect to 
“get that receipt.” We realize that 
this is exam, w'eek, but why worry? ! 
Take out a paid-up policy in the 1917 
Thistle and feel secure. First pre­
mium, $1.25, and the second pays up 
the policy. Dividends begin early in 
the spring. Get a receipt now!
A big bit for six bits.
The Director has receivod a lettor 
from Uncle John Brashoar and has 
sent it to The Tartan for publication. 
From the letter, it would appear that 
our Uncle John Is having the time of 
Ills life and lots of Pittsburgh weather. 
The lettor is:

My Dear Arthur—Doar Mrs. Hamer- 
selling, The Boys, and Colleaguos at

It is almost impossible for me to 
get half as many letters to my doar 
friends as 1 want to write, but so 
much time is absorbed In sight-seeing 
and trying to do things in the fearful 
cold that we have had over since we 
left Seoul in Korea. Even the hotel 
is so cold that about the only com­
fortable way to write is to pull our 
table near the "refrigerator,” as we 
call it, back our chairs up against It, 
and do the best we can.
We met our first cold weather at 
Muckden, or just after we left Seoul. 
Everything in the way of water had 
frozen in the wash-room and lavatory, 
and did the same trick on our way 
from Muckden; the only thing we 
could do was to borrow a little water 
from the cook. When we got to 
Muckden it was 7%° below zero, and 
had been S9 during the night. Al­
though wre have had sunshine since 
reaching here Sunday morning, it has 
not been above zero any time, and

DRAMA DEPT. GIVES TWO EXCELLENT PLAYS
“The Dead Are Dead” and 
“The Importance of Being 
Earnest” Presented
On Thursday evening, in the The­
ater of School of Applied Design, the 
Department of Drama gave, as its an­
nual offering of modern drama, Oscar 
Wilde’s society play, "The Importance 
of Being Earnest.”
This was preceded by a “curtain 
raiser,” "The Dead Are Dead,” by 
Harold Brighouse. There can bo no 
question in regard to the appropriate­
ness of the title of this one-act play— 
nothing could be “deader” from a dra­
matic viewpoint—there is not a line 
suggesting action in the entire piece. 
The yawns of the doctor wore super­
fluous, as the dialoguo acts as an ef­
fective narcotic.
Why Mr. Wilde’s clover comedy re-1 
quired a “curtain raiser," since it is j 
lengthy enough for an evening’s en­
tertainment, is a question. Is it pos­
sible that the exigencies of the occa­
sion demand, that a cast shall appear, 
no matter what the vehicle? The 
brilliancy of Mr. Wilde's dialogue 
noods 110 foil.
The cast gave a very praisoworthy 
performance of “The Importance of 
Being Earnest,” which was under the 
personal direction of Mr. Idem Payne 
(always a guarantee of oxcellenco), 
and the stage management of Fred­
eric McConnell.
'Plie stage settings, by Mr. J. Wood­
man Thompson, woro by 110 moans the 
least interesting features» of the play. 
Anyone familiar with Oscar Wilde’s 
gorgoousnoss of detail can understand 
what a sourso of inspiration they of­
fer to the artistic Imagination. The 
sotting for the first' act was a “thing 
of beauty," As an Interior, If could 
hardly bo oxcolled and ovoryono on- 
joyod the artistic revelation of what 
may bo achieved through the media of 
black and wlilto.

TECH QUINTETTE DROPS FAST GAME TO PITT
Clean Playing and Fast Pass­
ing Abound on Both Sides
In a fast, cleanly played game 
with the Pitt five, last Tuesday night, 
the varsity came away on the short 
end of a 33 to 16 score.
- The game was featured through­
out by quick passing and good team­
work on both sides. At the end of 
the first half it looked very much like 
Tech’s game, although the score
11 to 9 against them. The Plaid 
quintet passed all around the Pitt 
five, but were away off on shooting. 
They bombarded the tantalizing bas­
ket from all angles, at a distance and 
close up; they threw the ball among 
the spectators; but they succeeded 
in getting only three field goals. At 
the same time Captain Greene and 
his team mates kept so close a guard 
on the Panthers that they got but 
one field goal. Ben Lublc dropped 
9 out of 10 fouls in, placing his team 
into the lead.
Both teams showed a reversal of 
form In the second half, Pitt for the 
bettor, Tech slightly for the worse. 
At that If the varsity had shown any 
good shooting thoy would have taken 
away the laurels.
The chief weakness with the vars­
ity in the last two games has been 
its lack of punch In the second half. 
They have scored but one field goal in

THE PITT-TECH SMOKER
Tire forthcoming Pitt-Tech smoker, pronouncement of which, is 
made in this issue of the Tartan, will be one of the most important 
events of the present school year—that is, it will be if Tech students 
want to make it so. It is important for two reasons and those rea­
sons should be sufficient to induce every man on the campus to at-, 
lei id the affair.
Firstly it is the one opportunity which we have had this year to 
cement in some concrete way the feeling of friendship which of 
late has been growing up between the students of the Carnegie 
.’Institute of Technology and the students of the University of 
Pittsburgh. Last year, following the Pitt-Tech game a group of live 
wires' from our school arranged a smoker for Pitt men. The affair 
was a success. It accomplished oceans1 in wiping out the old feeling 
of distrust of Pitt that for some reason or other had been allowed to 
smoulder for too many years. It brought the undergraduate body 
of students from Pittsburgh’s two great educational institutions 
together, for the first time in years, on a common ground of good 
fellowship and decency. It brought to the mind ol! all the men 
who were there that the soul of the average American undergradu­
ate is a. wonderful and noble thing and that that soul which is the 
celestial essence of life is as much akin to the students of Pitt as it 
is to the students ol! Tech. It brought to light,, perhaps for the 
Jirst time, the utter uselessness and futility of that ugly protoplasm 
ol! rivalry which the students of one college think they must have 
Tor the students of a near-by college. It may be human nature and 
part of the eternal law of physics that when two bodies rub against 
each other friction is the result. But must wo forever enslave' 
ourselves to instinctive tendencies without making even so much 
as an effort to go our destiny one better?
This is the spirit that prompts the students of the great school 
across the way to return the compliment which we in a humble and 
Miieere way paid them last year. And it behooves us to respond to 
their invitations with all the numbers, enthusiasm and courtesy that 
we can. Reciprocity between Pitt and Tech would be an asset 
to both schools and if is only our general ignorance of Pitt’s many 
• ine qualities that has kept, us from faking advantage of the firm 
friendship which she no doubt has always been willing' shotild be 
ours. Indeed the smoker which her students are giving ours is mere­
ly the culmination of previous efforts expressive of that willingness. 
Pitt gives us I he chance to get acquainted with her. If we take 
advantage of the chance we will better understand her and appre­
ciate her.
•The second reason for attending the Pitt-Tech smoker concerns 
ourselves. There" is always sentiment oil our campus for a more 
perfect Tech union which means that after all there is not as much 
union between the students of all the schools as there should be. 
The reasons for this are obvious and in some ways unpreve'ntable.: 
But in attending the Pitt-Tech smoker we have a chance to do 
something en masse, as a complete* Tech entity Pitt does not know 
us as Science men or Industries men or Design men. We are 
hiiowii over there as Techites arid as Techites will we go forward to 
erect them, and We shall enjoy ourselves as all-Tech men. It will, 
as it were, put us objectively in our own light, and, in a position to 
the Pitt students, we will have the opportunity to observe and study 
ourselves as a. whole—as belonging to Tech and not to Design, In­
dustries or Science.
FORMER TARTAN MAN NEAR VERDUN FRONT
Interesting Letter Received from 
E. G. Hamilton, with the Amer­
ican Ambulance in France.
A letter has recently been re 
ceived from IS. G. Hamilton, for­
merly a Tech. student, and past 
managing editor of “The’Tartan,” 
relating his experiences while in 
the employ of the American Am­
bulance in France.
It was Mr. Hamilton’s original 
intention when leaving Pittsburgh 
last spring, to enter the service in 
Belgium, behind the German lines. 
However, after staying in France 
for six months to become acquaint­
ed with the French language, the 
German ruling allowing no one 
residing in France during the war 
to enter Belgium-, he was obliged 
to forsake his original plans.
Since the 25th of May he has 
been in Paris, driving ambulances 
and trucks, this again was not ac­
cording to his intentions. He is 
at present in charge of eighteen 
cars, having under him Russians, 
Belgians, English, French and 
I talians.
Concerning his impressions of
I men of France are fighting for the 
j life of their nation.
The French are a most wonder- 
! fill people. They have philosoph- 
: ically settled down to endure their 
! hardships without complaint and 
i to take the exigencies of this 
' period as a matter of course, 
j They have wiped out all traces.of 
! the German invasion where possi- 
: ble, have re-organized their busi- 
j nesses and calmly await the finish, 
j The English haven’t yet recovered 
j from their excitement and haven’t 
| yet settled down to make the best 
' of things.”
TECH QUINTET DROPS
FAST GAME TO PITT
(Continued From Page One.)
I two games for this period and but 7 
I field goals altogether in those two. 
j The team seems to possess no natural 
shot. Abrams comes the nearest to 
being one, but he seldom gets the; 
chance.
But at that luck has been against 
our passers and they hope to take a 
brace in the State game next Satur­
day and get into the winning habit. 
State defeated Syracuse, who defeat­
ed Pitt, so its sure to be a hot game.
Lefty Abrams thought Referee 
“Free” Davis was to free with his. 
fouls and told liini so. As a result; 
Davis imposed three more on Tech 
of which Lubic made good two.

than the prof did which made /the prof 
sore, an so forth, mi so 100, etc.. One of 
th« weekly magazines that has a guy 
rltin for cm what thinks lie’s clever, says: 
"It won’t be long before we’ll be greeting 
the annual horde of collugc students whose, 
inability to see. thru the mid year exams 
has brought about many serious ciihcp of ‘ 
eye strain.” Now wo know there’s a 
grain a truth in what the guy says, but 
just the same we fuel he must be a sort 
of a mean guy.
; Last week the liissyncss manager of this 
! sheet puls some posters around the school 
; sayin' that this here colum is to deal with 
the problems of the school in a humerus 
manner, an’ that It’s supposed to be force- < fill too. I don’t know where he gets that 
| stuff. Problems is for the class room an’ 
I don’t know nutliin’ about them any­
how, an- as for bein’ humerous, I still 
gotta sec the guy what can get away with 
working a problem in a humerous way. 
And as for bein’ forceful, I tried that onct 
but the next week when the sheet wus" 
printed I noticed that all the forceful stuff 
was cut out, the editor says that he don’t 
care so much about the grammor in1 the 
sheet, I guess I didn’t need to tell you 
that much, but he sc/, wc gotta use proper 
language.
Last week they had another guy riten 
some of the headlines for the sheet, an’ 
T guess he didn’t know much about so­
ciety, for he gets a story of a dunce the 
dorm boys is goin’ to give and writes over 
the top of it thnt the girls’ dorms are go­
in’ to hold dance, which caused a lot 
a hard feelings, because there were a 
lot a guys around the school what hadn’t 
heard nothin’ about a girls’ dnnce, an’ 
they right away got sore an’ thought some 
other guy had beaten their time. That 
just shows how much some fellers trust 
their girlB, but then why should they, you 
can’t tell no more about a girl than what 
you can sec, and you can’t tell any more 
about n girl by her wrappers than you can 
about a cignr- by its wrapper.
A PRECEDENT
One of the greatest things which the thoughtful student is 
Iryiug to establish today here at Tech, is the formation of certain 
.customs and precedents, which go together to give a college or 
similar institution its personality. Without such customs no school 
:'s a real success. Some time ago some i houghful individuals estab­
lished the custom which ruled that one end of the “Beanery” was 
.E be set aside for the faculty and the seniors, and for some time 
the rule was adhered to. A custom had been established. Now it 
seems that this rule is regarded as a dead issue, one which is not 
to be considered.
Who is to blame? No, wc are not going to blame the freshmen, 
nor the sophomores, nor the .juniors! They are of course in the 
wrong for not abiding by the ruling, lint where, are the seniors? 
They are the ones upon whom the burden of the blame should fall. 
Wo personally feel that if they are so dead as not to be able to 
assert their own rights, that the others should have a place for 
themselves where the seniors would not be allowed to go. Where 
is this so called “Plcbc regulation committee?” We always did 
think this bunch were dead, now we know it. Where are the senior 
presidents of the three men’s schools? Evidently also asleep at the 
switch.
Nothing is so contemptible as a man who accepts an honor and 
visibility, and then promptly, forgets that he' has'duties to per-
I'jiigland and France and the, ef­
fects of the war on each country, 
he states some interesting views. 
He writes, in part:
'England is war ridden. You 
cannot move-' without filling out 
papers gi ving your reason for de­
siring to move, and each time re­
peating your ancestry lo the third 
generation, occupation, age, and 
various other personal character­
istics. Soldiers are everywhere, 
gi ving the streets a decided brown 
tone with their khaki uniforms. 
Women .are doing most of the 
men's work, and doing it well, at 
that. London is black at night 
and early in the evening one is 
given a treat, by seeing the bril­
liant fingers of light sweeping the 
sky as the searchlights- are tried 
out. •
Entrance to many parts of the 
| country is closed to foreigners, 
cameras are absolutely forbidden 
I and everywhere, on every avail­
able place, one sees large posters 
! demanding by means of various 
I pictures and slogans that you en- 
j list for King and Country, that the 
j stay-at-homes exercise the most 
rigid economy (not very effective, 
to judge by appearances), to-keep 
closed mouths in the presence of 
strangers, (hardly necessary to 
the English, I thought).
But France, and especially 
Paris, is so different. Shops and 
streets are crowded with well- 
dressed men and women. The 
large number of foreigners, cause 
civilian clothes to be in the ma­
jority, and anyway. Paris was al­
ways full of soldiers, 1 understand. 
Taxis swarm the streets, the cafes 
are crowded, beautiful women lill 
the restaurants and the drives in 
the Bois de Boulogne and life 
goes on as ever.
Only sometimes at night, I can 
hear from my window, a sinister 
throb in the atmosphere like a 
very distant thunder storm, only 
more pulsating, and I know that 
only forty-five: miles, (at one time 
only ten miles from the city), t'.ie
markably fast player and a dead shot, 
but somehow he couldn’t get into 
shooting form with Scoops Carey lay­
ing on him.
After Finlay had made one im­
pressive miss at a long shot. Harry 
Keck of the Post, said: "The worst
of it Is, he comes so close to. making 
thorn.”

TWO EXCELLENT PLAYS
(Continued From Page One.)
The garden scene for Act II was 
charming in its natural simplicity— 
while the drawing-room interior for 
the last act had the proper gloom and 
dignity of the Manor House.
•Mr. John W. Burke and Veolante 
Bollinger carried off the honors of the 
evening. Mr. Burke, as “Algernon 
Moncrieff, a gentleman .of leisure.” 
identified himself with the character 
in a wonderful manner, creating much 
favorable comment. Mrs. . Bollinger 
was unusually well cast as “Lardy 
Bracknell," giving a most interesting 
interpretation of this particular type 
of fashionable women.
Mr. C. Frederick Stein’s “Jack 
Worthing” a society man of limited 
income, but very earnest in extracting 
the pleasures of life, was carefully 
played and well received.
Mr. Howard Smith was most divert­
ing in the role of the “Rev. Dr. Chasu- 
buie.” Miss’ Esther Fromme’s “Hon.- 
Gwendolen Fairfax,” the experienced 
and brilliant society girl, was one of 
the best things she has done. Miss 
Katharine Jones gave a very pleasant 
portrayal of “Cecily Cardew,” the 
ward of John Worthing, while Miss 
Hazel Beck, in the . role of “Miss 
Prim,” her governess, created much 
merriment. Mr. Frederic McConnell 
gave the small role of “Lane" the 
same careful attention he bestows on 
his larger roles.
For the Friday evening perform­
ance the male cast was the same, but 
"Lady Brackell” was entrusted to 
Miss Inez Krebs, who, as usual, gave 
an interesting interpretation of the 
role, while the same may be said of 
the work of Miss Ena Lewis, who did 
the "Hon. Gwendolen Fairfax.”’ Miss 
Eula Guy did “Cecily Cardew,” • a 
rather more sophisticated interpreta­
tion of the character than in the hands 
of Miss Jones. Miss Marguerite Bol­
linger presented a much stronger- 
minded “Miss Prim” than Miss Beck. 
The contrasts were interesting.

of human labor of men, women and 
children is the work done. All prac­

Well, here we are in real China. 
Too cold to See much, but I have al­
ready been at the Christmas festivals 
of the V. M. C. A., made speeches (,?) 
to the Chinese kiddies, had a tine 
Christmas dinner with Dr. Ferguson 
and his family; met and had a de­
lightful hour with our N. S. Minister; 
several trips in the Chinese quarters 
and stores; tea with the secretary of 
of the Y. M. C. A., a bright South Car­
olinian and his wife, and today visited 
my old friend, Wu Ting Fang, now 
Minister of Foreign Affairs. Am now 
sitting with my feet on my hot water 
bottle, and my body backed up against 
the "refrigerator,” and will close, as 
I couldn't tell you all in -10 pages. Be 
sure to let any of the boys read this 
letter who care to do so.
Best love to all.
Ever yours,
UNCLE JOHN BRASH EAR. '
(Continued From Page One.) 
last night, which was of average cold­
ness, Swasey's thermometer went on 
an excursion to the bottom of it, or 
S° below zero at dinner time.
The proprietor of the hotel says 
they cannot get any heat on the upper, 
floors, and the "refrigerator” in my 
room and bath-room were indeed in 
the business of refrigerating. Just 
now by taking out the drain plug I 
am getting some heat, but, jiminy! my 
fingers are cold. We go out for an 
hour or so in the rickshas, and our 
feec are about rrozen when we get 
back. So we haven't much chance, as 
yet, to take a run over the great wall 
of China, though we have ridden 
around the great wall of Peking, some 
13 English miles long, about 30 feet 
high, and 40 feet across on top. The 
great wall of China, 1,500 miles long, 
was all built by slaves, serfs and 
coolies, compelled unde*» penalty of 
death to do the work. How it was 
ever done, puzzles me..
So many good people gave me their 
blessings when I left Pittsburgh that 
I wish I could write them all. I found 
225 letters, telegrams and postals 
awaiting me at the steamer. Our trip 
across the ocean was certainly a 
tempestuous one. Even our good 
Captain. Robinson told me it was the 
worst trip he had ever made, the bad 
weather was so continuous. Not one 
good day out of 14, and we should 
have reached Yokahoma in 11. How­
ever, we got in all O. K., and Uncle 
John was not seasick- a single hour. 
We stayed in Yokahoma two days and 
had the pleasure of a lovely visit from 
Mr. and Mrs. Guthrie, whom 1 had the 
pleasure to present with a letter of 
greeting from President Wilson, a 
wonderfully elaborate engrossed and 
bound set of resolutions from his Ma­
sonic brethren, and a set of resolu­
tions from the Council of Pittsburgh. 
Next day we visited him at Tokio, 
and afterward attended a grand lunch­
eon at Dr. Tachamine’s at which my 
old friends, Baron Kikirclii and Dr. 
"Lerav, with other prominent guests, 
were present.
Our trip'- through Japan was most 
interesting, for the weather was fair, 
and the whole island of farmers busy 
with their work, men and women, 
wading in the great rice fields, plant­
ing rice, etc.
Our night trip across the Straits of 
Korea was in strong contrast to the 
illy named Pacific, “quiet as .a mill 
pond,” and Fusen, the southern ter­
minus of the Korean and Manchurian 
raihVay, was reached within an hour 
and a half. Here we found a new 
world, and to me a God-forsaken one; 
for all my good missionary friends 
tell us of the great good hearts of a 
very poor people; indeed when we 
visited Seoul, we found many things 
in the past-and present history of the 
people of Korea that would indicate 
a hopeful outlook for the future. Of 
course, Japan interests dominate all 
through Korea and Manchuria.
The authorities at Tokio had writ­
ten and telegraphed the Governor of 
Korea of our coining, and we were 
treated royally. In fact, kindness 
overdone, in taking us In autos, to sec 
.the sights of Seoul. Next day we vis­
ited the Severance Hospital, the con­
ference of Methodist missionaries, 
found good people among them that I 
knew, and .that .night at 9:30. off for 
Muckden, where we ran into the 
minus zero weather, which has fol­
lowed us right along to Peking. The 
Government of Japan had sent word 
ahead, and the Japanese Consul Gen­
eral made it possible to go even into 
the “holy of holies.” The American 
Consul General was more than kind 
to us, but his wife had presented him 
with a nice baby that morning, and, 
of course, we would not let him leave 
the Embassy. Indeed, I told him if he 
neglected his wife and baby for me,
I would report him for malfeasance 
in office!
We visited temples, etc., galore, and 
wound up with a visit to Dr. Christie 
and liis wife, who have been in Man-, 
churia for 35,years. He is head of a 
hospital and medical school and a 
grand old Scot is lie. Some of our 
party visited the Japanese Hospital 
next morning before train time, but 
Swasey and I did not care to have our 
nose and ears frost-bitten . So we de­
clined to go. We left for Peking at
II a. m. in a joke of a train, but man­
aged to put in the day and night some 
how, going into the barn-of-a-looking 
and a barn-of-a-feeling car for dinner. 
We found it imperative to go back, 
put on our overcoats, bring our steam­
er rug to cover our knees, and wear 
our caps. A motley crew for the four 
meals we had on that train, and cold 
as it was, there were two Chinamen 
who slept on the floor of the passage 
way of the car. (It was a compart­
ment car.) A heavy snow for this 
district had covered the ground about 
four inches deep, so we did not see 
much of the country, but Manchuria 
is . in strange contrast to Korea, the 
latter one the narrower, sometimes 
the wider valley between mountains 
cultivated, but every inch of soil cul­

FOR THE 
STUDENT
Carnegie Institute of TechnologyMODERN DANCES
Classes and PrivatoThe following is a report of the 
Advisory Committee of University 
Presidents on the Summer Military 
Instruction Camps for Students:
Report of the Advisory Committee 
ol University Presidents 011 the 
Summer Military Instruction Camps 
for Students, November 15, 1916.
Owing to tin* need of officers of 
the regular army for duty 011 the 
Mexican border, student instruction 
camps were held during the past 
summer, only at Monterey, Califor­
nia, and Plattsburg, New York. The 
larger attendance this year made 
field manoeuvres possible 011 a j 
broader scale than 'before. The stu­
dents attending the camps were 
given careful oversight by the or­
ders in charge in respect to Lent ac­
commodation, food and general sani­
tary and medical care. The spirit 
displayed was excellent, and the 
students as a body were greatly 
,benefited by the experience.
We repeat the commendation given 
by this committee in 1913,. 1914 and 
1915 to these summer camps. This, 
commendation is largely based on 
the opinions formed by members of 
the committee who personally visited 
and studied the Plattsburg and Mon­
terey carnpS.
We believe that the open air train­
ing and life of these camps, given 
under careful, competent supervision, 
result in great benefit, physical and 
mental, to those attending, and that 
tlie military instruction materially 
aids in oducatlng our youth to an 
Intelligent appreciation of the ovlls 
of war, and of the preparation nee. 
ossary to avert or meet them. If is 
a fact that some .students who wont, 
this year to Plattsburg with the ex­
pectation of staying one month, re­
mained two months, and some re­
mained three months. There is 110 
way in which a college or university 
student can more wisely, healthfully 
and profitably pass his entire sum­
mer vacation than in one of these 
camps.
We express the hope that the 
camps to be held in 1917 will have 
a still larger attendance, that the 
Government will be able to estab­
lish a number of such camps at 
points conveniently reached from dif­
ferent sections of the country, and 
that the authorities and students of 
the universities’ and colleges of the 
country will support the movement 
on a larger scale than ever before.

ORGANIZATION 
COMMITTEE BEGINS CONSTITUTION
Science School Committee 
Adopts Report of Sub-Com- 
mittee On General Outline 
of Constitution
WORK OF A. S. WALL 
AT CARNEGIE INSTITUTE
Alfred Wall was Well Known 
as Painter and Writer in 
Pittsburgh
Last Thursday the Science School 
organization Committee, composed of 
representatives from all four classes, 
hold itH second meeting, and at that 
time adopted the report of the sub­
committee on the. general outline of 
the future constitution. On this sub­
committee Generl Chairman Orr had 
appointed Wilson, 17; Pearce, '18;, 
and Armor, *19. These men recom­
mended the following general outline:
1. Preamble, including the purpose 
of the organization.
2. Name of general organization.
3. Membership in general organiza­
tion.
4. Governing body for general or­
ganization; form of this body, repre­
sentation upon it, and election to it.
5. Powers of this governing body, 
covering elections, bulletin boards, 
club room, Flebe regulations, etc.
(5. Check upon their powers; refer­
endum to the students.
7. Organization of governing body; 
officers, standing committees, meet­
ings, etc.
8. By-Laws.
9. Amendments.
After considerable discussion it was 
decided by the general committee to 
adopt this report as it stands. It was 
understood, of course, that this out­
line is by no means complete, but 
merely forms a basis for the real 
work which is coming. During the 
week Chairman Orr will appoint a sub­
committee to take care of each part 
of the general outline. These sub­
committees will suggest a wording 
for the part of the constitution as­
signed to them, and will report to the 
next meeting of the committee as a 
whole on Tuesday, February 13. In 
this way it is hoped to divide the 
work, and accomplish in a short time 
what might otherwise take many 
months.
The first sub-committee will con­
sider the preamble and articles 1-3, 
and is composed of Merrill, Wolfe ana 
Mills.
The second sub-committee is Mor- 
ley, Pearce, Kinder and Mills. They 
will consider article 4.
The third sub-committee will work 
oii articles 15-9. The men on this com­
mittee are Wilson, Lawson and Ar­
mor.

A pin map which bus been at 
tractlng considerable attention is 
one made by Messrs. 13akei\ Balaurle 
Gretzler, McCullough and Sinclair 
members of Mr. J. Andersen I'Mtzger- 
ald's class in Statistics, to show the 
homes of I lie day students of the 
School of Applied Science (the engi­
neering school ) The most interest­
ing things about the map are (1) 
how Tech’s fame lias gone abroad, 
and (2) that the overwhelming ma­
jority of the day science students 
are from a distance. Three per cent 
of the students come from twelve 
foreign lands. Only 22 per cent of 
the enrollment lives in Pittsburgh, 
and 52 per cent come from outside 
of Pennsylvania. Ohio and New 
York States combined are as well 
represented as the City of Pitts­
burgh. Connecticut and Massachu­
setts each sends as many pipils as 
West Virginia and Maryland, respec­
tively. The seven leading states ac­
cording to the sizes of their delega­
tions are Pennsylvania, Ohio, New 
York, Connecticut, West Virginia, 
Maryland and Massachusetts. The 
distant cities which contribute the 
largest number of students each are 
Baltimore, Hartford, Conn., New 
York, Bridgeport, Conn., and Wash­
ington, D. C..

Now is the time to subscribe to 
The Tartan for the balance of the 
year.
According to an announcement 
made by the Director of Fine Arts, 
there were placed on exhibition in 
the permanent collection gallery at 
the Carnegie Institute, five paint­
ings by the late Alfred Wall. Four 
of these paintings—“Woods in Au­
tumn,” "Sunlight and Shadow," 
“Edge of the Woods” and “Land­
scape”- were purchased by the Fine 
Arts Committee for the permanent 
collection, and one, “Mountain Brook 
in Autumn,” was a gift to the Car­
negie Institute by James Verner 
Long and Albert M. Long, executors 
of the estate of the late Mrs. Eliza- 
.beth Verner Long.
Mr. Alfred Wall was well known 
during the many years of his active 
life in Pittsburgh as an able painter 
and critic. He was always inter­
ested in every movement for the ad­
vancement of art in Pittsburgh, and 
was deeply interested in the School 
of Design during the period of its 
activity in Pittsburgh, serving on 
probably eyery jury in Its History. 
He was a ’ member of the Scalp 
Level colony, and witli George I-Iet- 
zel, Clarence Johns, Charles Linford 
and other Pittsburgn painters, helped 
to make that picturesque village fa­
mous. . He always won friends by 
his deep sympathy and kindly inter­
est, and his gentle and genial man­
ner, and -was particularly helpful to 
young art students, giving them 
sympathetic and profitable advice 
.reely. 1-Ie was a charter member 
of the Board of Trustees of the 
Carnegie Institute, and was made 
a member of the Fine Arts Com­
mittee at the time of the organiza­
tion of the Institute.
Mr Wall was a painter of rare 
ability and, although he did not pro­
duce a large number .of works, these 
have given him a high position in 
the estimation of those who have 
seen and studied them. John W. 
Alexander, always a friend and ad­
mirer of Mr. Wall's, in speaking of 
him, said: “1-Ie was a man of won­
derful ability.” Again we may 
quote, this time from the well- 
known art Critic, Mr. , Charles H. 
Caffln, who wrote, after a visit to 
Pittsburgh: "... .during this
visit if was my good fortune to be­
come acquainted with the work of 
a Pittsburgh landscape-painter, who, 
so far as his art, at least, was con­
cerned, had never been beyond the 
limits of his city. And yet this 
Alfred Wall, as one may judge from 
a single example (and if is to his 
credit that he had no sot manner 
or choice of view), could have 
worked alongside the Bnrbizon men 
and won 1 ho honor of their comrade­
ship.”
Mr. Erasmus Wilson, (he “Quiet 
Obsorvor,” in an issue of The 
Gazotte-Times, in June, 189(5, writes 
tlie following appreciation: “There
is not an artist in (ho city, nor has 
there been one for many years past, 
who would not place a high esti­
mate on Mr. Wall’s opinion of their 
work. lie was what might be 
termed an out-and-outer. If asked 
for an opinion on a painting or 
sketch he gave il as though he 
didn’t know the author. And, no 
matter how unfavorable the opinion, 
it was never discourteous to the 
artist, nor would it savor of fault- 
linding.”
After giving an opinion as to the 
art value of a work lie would take 
special delight in showing (he au­
thor its strong and weak points, and 
in suggesting how the subject might 
have been bandied with better ef­
fect. It was this, and the- kindly 
manner in which it was done, that 
made him such a popular critic, 
even among those who could hardly 
expect a favorable criticism from 
him. His motto was: “Always tell
the truth in your work,” and his 
contention was that a falsehood in 
a picture would show, in spite of 
all the gloss that could be put on 
it; and that the truth in it was its 
strength.”
Mr. Wall was born at Mt. Pleas­
ant , Pennsylvania, in 1825, of •Eng­
lish parentage, his father and moth­
er having come to this country from 
Oxford, England. When still a boy 
ho came to Pittsburgh, and entered 
the wholesale grocery business with 
his brother-in-law, but gave il up at. 
the age of 21 for the moro congenial 
pursuit of art. Ho devoted his time 
to (he study of painting for many 
years; Later lie became a member 
of the firm of J. J. Gillespie &
Company. Mr. Wall was neknowl 
odged to be the best art critic in
Western Pennsylvania, and his judg­
ment was always sought by pros­
pective purchasers in Pittsburgh and 
vicinity. He had perhaps a greater
influence in matters pertaining to
art in this section than any other
single individual of his time. His 
pretentions were modest, yet he 
worked constantly, and always with 
a view to elevating the standards of 
art.
In addition to the paintings by 
Mr. Wall, which were installed in 
the permanent collection, a portrait 
of Mrs. Schenley, by Thomas Lewis, 
was placed on exhibition. This por­
trait is lent to the Department of 
Fine Arts by the Schenley estate.
