Russian Theater Authority Watches 
Dramats at Work on Four Plays
By DOROTHY J. MOYER
Dr. Henry Wadsworth Longfel- 
ow Dana, of Harvard University, 
Authority on the Russian theater, 
f and grandson of the famous poet, 
visited the Department of Drama 
on Friday afternoon, where he 
watched simultaneous rehearsals 
of four different plays and spoke 
briefly to the students.
Mr. Dana said he was much im­
pressed by this “four-ringed cir- 
I ous,” whose concentrated industry 
he has not seen equalled even in 
I the workshop at Yale. He found 
Ithe acting material and direction 
*very interesting; outstanding in his 
estimation was the departmental 
attitude expressing a "courage of 
conviction,” a “willingness to ex­
periment,” and the frankness of 
‘‘calling a spade a spade,” dis­
played in the “tremendous full 
strength, without soft pedaling” of 
the rehearsals of “Man and the 
Masses,” which he deemed “\vor- 
| thy of the tremendous tension of 
LToller in writing his play.”
Pr es. Dodds 
Is Founder’s 
Day Speaker
New Head of Princeton 
Formerly Held Many 
Government Posts
FORM ALIN VITATIONS 
ARE NOT REQUIRED
Art Exhibit Awards Will 
Be Announced at End 
Of Celebration
He reminded the students that 
the importance of their work 
“looms in perspective the farther 
away from Pittsburgh 3rou go,” 
that it is the college theater groups 
which have given a new lease of 
life to drama in the last 20 years, 
and that their group at Carnegie, 
and those under Dr. George P. Ba­
ker, first at Harvard, then at Yale, 
“form a significant part of theater 
history.”
His wish is that they may “carry 
on the work with that same spirit, 
too rarely found in New York, but 
more often in the Moscow theatres 
of today—a real enthusiasm, love, 
fire, fever, fervor—to fulfill all the 
hopes for the drama world.”
Professor Dana, who received 
the degree of doctor of philosophy 
in the field of comparative litera­
ture at Harvard, has been special­
izing in contemporary drama, mak­
ing many trips to the chief drama 
centers of Europe to study and 
write about the movements there.

The thirty-sixth annual celebra­
tion of Founder’s Day at the Car­
negie Institute will be held on 
Thursday afternoon, October 19, at 
3 o’clock in the Carnegie Music 
Hall. Dr. Harold Willis Dodds, the 
new president of Princeton Uni­
versity, will deliver the principal 
address. There will be an opening 
organ selection by Mr. Marshall 
Bid well, organist and director of 
music at the Carnegie Institute, 
and music by a quartet composed 
of the following local singers: 
Margaret Spaulding Stockdale, 
Mabel King, Will A. Rhodes, Jr., 
and Raymond T. Griffin, with Earl 
Mitchell as accompanist. The invo­
cation will be pronounced by the 
Rev. Louis H. Evans, D. D., min­
ister of the Third Presbyterian 
Church.
The concluding feature of the 
Founder’s Day exercises will be 
the announcement of the prizes 
awarded for paintings in the Inter- 
tional Art Exhibition of 1933.
Dr. Dodds was a professor of 
politics at Princeton before his ap­
pointment as president. 1-Ie is the 
editor of the National Municipal 
Review and has held many gov­
ernmental positions here and in 
Nicaragua.
There will be no formal invita­
tions or reserved seats for the 
Founder’s Day exercises this year. 
In past years there have been ex­
pressions of disappointment from 
those who for one reason or an­
other failed to receive invitations, 
and it was therefore decided this 
year to dispense with invitations 
and also to abolish reserved seats 
and tickets of admission. The en­
tire hall will be thrown open to the 
public.
The Founder’s Day Committee is 
composed of the following mem­
bers of the Board of Trustees: W. 
S. Arbuthnot, chairman; John S. 
Herron, James H. Lockhart, James 
R. Macfarlane, and William Wat­
son Smith.
Founder’s Day, sponsored by the , 
Carnegie Institute, has no connec­
tion with Carnegie Day which is 
observed in November by Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. Classes 
will be held as usual on Thursday.
Last Semester’s Honor Roll 
Cites 221 for Excellence
Largest List Since Honor Roll Has Been Published; 
College of Fine Arts Leads With Seventy-Nine 
Honored; College of Engineering Second
Mathematicians 
Organize to Aid 
Research Work
At a meeting held Saturday, 
October 7, at the University Club, 
40 mathematicians, representing 
nine colleges, three industrial re­
search laboratories and four high 
schools of Western Pennsylvania 
and adjoining territories formally 
organized a section of the Mathe­
matical Association of America. 
Prof. W. D. Cairns, secretary-treas- 
urer of the national organization, 
was the guest of honor and as­
sisted the local group in the forma­
tion of the section. Officers elected 
were Dr. C. S. Atkinson, Washing­
ton and Jefferson, chairman; Dr. J. 
S. Taylor, University of Pittsburgh, 
secretary-treasurer; Dr. E. G. Olds, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
and Prof. J. C. Stayer, Juniata Col­
lege, members of the executive 
committee.
It is the purpose of the organiza­
tion to promote an interest in 
mathematical research, to provide 
meetings for the presentation and 
discussion of papers, and to fur­
nish an opportunity for fellowship 
to the mathematicians of Western 
Pennsylvania and adjacent dis­
tricts. In addition to the institu­
tions represented in person at the 
organization meeting, letters favor­
ing the movement and promising 
active support were received from 
many other schools and research 
organizations, including those as 
far distant as Penn State and the 
University of West Virginia. The 
section plans to hold three regular 
meetings annually, the next to oc­
cur some time in February.

be about equal to half the number 
registrered in February, which 
was 135.
The majority of those entered 
in the classes this term are gradu­
ates of 1932 and 1933, and none oi 
the group represent a class beyond I 
1925. This is a marked difference 
from last Fpbruary when members 
of the groun were graduates of 
classes as far back as that of 
1914.
Two hundred and twenty-one stu­
dents, repiesenting 10 per cent of 
an enrollment of 2,142, were cited 
for honors on a basis of their 
grades for the second semester of 
last year, Alan Bright, Registrar, 
has announced.
The list is the largest,- from both 
a numerical and percentage basis, 
since the publishing of the Honor 
Roll began three years ago.
The largest number heretofore 
was 211, which was in the second 
semester of 1931-32. For the first 
semester of last year 191 students 
were named.
The College of Fine Arts led 
last semester in the distribution 
by colleges with 79 honored. The 
College of Engineering placed GO 
on the list; Margaret Morrison, 57; 
Engineering and Industries fresh­
men, 11; the College of Industries 
and the Carnegie Library School, 
both seven. Margaret Morrison was 
the only college to gain appre­
ciably over the second semester 
of 1931-1932, when 44 Avere on its 
list.
The senior class, with a total 
of 7S, had the largest class repre­
sentation, based on class stand-
ings last semester. Following were 
the junior class, 5(5; sophomore, 
79; and freshman, 3S.
Two students, Dorothy J. Morse, 
’33, Department of Music in the 
College of Fine Arts, and Hyman 
Serbili, ’34, Department of Math­
ematics in the College of Engi­
neering, received A grades in every 
subject to earn a factor of 6.00.
In the College of Engineering 
the division by departments was: 
Commercial engineering, 12; me­
chanical engineering, 11; physics, 
10; electrical engineering, S; civil 
and chemical engineering, 5; metal­
lurgical, 4; chemistry, 3; and math­
ematics, 2.

Night Registration 
To Show Increase
The total night school enroll­
ment, as recorded at the registrar’s 
office through Tuesday, October 10, 
was 1,737. Comparing this figure 
with 1,829 the total of last year on 
October 15, a decline in attendance 
is apparently indicated. However, 
reports from the registrar’s office in­
dicate that by October 15 last 
year’s total will easily he equalled, 
if not exceèded.
Tlie figures for night school reg­
istration for this and the past year 
have included part-time students, 
who now are grouped with the 
night school students, although 
part-time classes continue on Sat­
urdays.
The enrollment is distributed in 
the colleges as follows: Engineer­
ing, 620; Industries, 647; Fine Arts, 
470. Last year’s total on Y)ctober 
15 showed the following distribu­
tion in the colleges: Engineering,
569; Industries, 762; and Fine Arts, 
498. These figures show a decided 
increase In the enrollment for En­
gineering arid a slight decrease in 
that of Industries and Arts.
A Notre Dame pep rally will be 
held in the Bowl on Friday night 
at 7:30. During the program, which 
will be featured by a torchlight 
parade, Howard I-Iarpster and his 
assistant coach, Don Lovewell, will 
address the gathering. The cheer­
leaders are planning to practice 
several new formations in rehear­
sal for the Notre Dame game the 
next day.
The cheerleaders are planning 
many new stunts to bo usod at 
home games. At the Temple game 
the new girl cheerleaders woro In­
troduced to the student body by 
appearing from behind a large 
figure of a Scotchman in kilts. The 
figure, which is an exact likeness 
of a Kiltie with his bag pipe, stands 
17 feet high and is equippod with 
wheels so that It can bo rolloa 
onto the field between linlvos. It 
was designed by Amnion Godshall, 
head cheerleader.
At the Temple game the cheer­
leaders Introduced the now stunt 
of forming a black silhouette on a 
white background in the student 
section betwoon the halves. The 
silhouette used in every game will 
always bo an omblom of the op­
posing team. Tlio figure usod at 
the Tomplo gamo was an owl. At 
each game black and wlilto will bo 
usod rather than the school colors 
because It is felt that tho con­
trast Is more striking whon they 
are used. Tt Is believed that this 
is tho first 11 mo black and white 
have boon used for such figures by 
any collogo in tho country.
At the Pitt, gamo tho choorlond- 
ors will dramatize the “locomo­
tive" yell. The plans are, how­
ever, to bo kept socret until tho 
gamo. At tho Notro Dnmo gamo 
a now formation will bo uood on 
tho “lustltuto,’’ and tumbling will 
bo featured. Tho Klltlo Band has 
charge of tho planning of stunts 
for tho W. & J. gamo.
Tho squad of choorloadors Is 
composod of Ruth Schmolso, ’85, 
Department of Homo Economics; 
Ida Blckloy, ’37, Dopartmont of 
Sculpture.
The choorloadors aro very anx­
ious to borrow throo black Scottio 
dogs. Any ono who can got one 
Is asked to got In touch with Am­
mon Godshall.

Editor of Thistle 
Reveals Several 
Novel Features
Edward Sh'ide IVins 
Memorial Fellowship
Edward K. Schnde '33, has re­
ceived the Alfred C. Wlngold 
Memorial Fellowship for outstand­
ing work in the Department of 
Architecure. Mrs. Wlngold do­
nated the fellowship in memory of 
Mr. Wingold, former Instructor in 
Architectural Design, who was 
drowned in Grove City on August 
14.
Mr. Schade, a resident of St. 
Louis, received the honor upon 
recommendation by the faculty of 
Mie Department of Architecture.
Plans which promise many im­
portant Innovations In tho compo­
sition of tho 1934 Thistle woro re­
vealed by Regis Joyce, odltor-ln- 
chiof, at the staff organization 
mooting held in tho Y. M. C. A. 
ofllco last Wednesday. In general 
the plans show that particular em­
phasis will be laid upon widening 
the scope of tho annual to make 
it appeal to the members of all 
four classes.
A complete change in tho meth­
od of selling the Thistle lias been 
planned to eliminate the unneces­
sary losses usually Incurred every 
year because of a large unsold sur­
plus of books. A campus-wide sub­
scription campaign will be insti­
tuted early in November. The num­
ber of copies of the Thistle to lie 
ordered from the printer will be 
gauged entirely by the number of 
subscriptions received.
Coincident with the subscription 
campaign there will be other feat­
ures to be announced later which 
will constitute the first Thistle 
Week ever to be held on the cam­
pus. During that week every stu­
dent will be made fully acquainted 
with all the new and interesting 
features of the 1934 Thistle to give 
each one a chance to place his or­
der and reserve a copy for delivery 
in the Spring.
One of the results of the propos­
ed subscription sales method will 
bo that the economies effected 
thereby will enable the staff to 
publish a book of high quality that 
can be sold at a substantially re­
duced price. As nearly as possi­
ble, all contracts will be awarded 
to firms operating in or around 
Pittsburgh to further expedite the 
production of the book and to in­
sure closer relations between the 
staff and the co-operating business 
houses.

Tho eleventh renewal of an an­
cient grid feud is scheduled for 
i tills Saturday when “Hunk” An- 
| derson brings his Greeu Ramblers 
I from Notre Dame to tlie Smoky 
I City to do battle with Howard 
' Harpstor's scrappy but untested 
j Carnegie Tech machine at the 
j Staduun. This classic is always 
\ the game of the year for the local 
fans and a crowd of from 50 to 60 
thousand enthusiasts is expected to 
jam tho mammoth bowl on the hill.
With the possiblo exception of 
tho Pitt game, there is no game 
on the schedule that the Plaid team 
would like more to win, for not 
only are they anxious to knock 
the Irish off their pinnacle but also 
to avenge a 42-0 massacre sufTored 
at tho hands of tho latter at South 
Bond last year. There are few 
who will give Carnegie oven an 
outsldo chance of winning, but foot­
ball gamos aro such indefinite 
quantities of Into that It is hard 
to predict an outcomo in advance, 
especially whon 0110 of tho teams 
ban such a substantial amount of 
tight as this year’s odltlon of tho 
Tartans soonis to have.
Notro Dnmo has shown a. start­
ling lack of scoring punch this soa- 
soii, although whether or not; this 
may bo attributed to poor playing 
011 tho part of tho Irish or to fine 
dofonslvo play 011 tho part of their 
opponents Is hard to Jtulgo. Notro 
Dame has played two games to 
date, winning ono and tying tho 
other. In tho opener a lighting 
olovon from Kansas University 
stopped the highly toutod Ander­
son mnclilno In Its tracks and only 
bad breaks and great play by the 
Irish line saved tho South Benders 
fro in lasting defeat. In the second 
game Indiana University, who 
hasn’t had much to brag about in 
tho last decade, held the Groen 
Ramblers to a 1.2-2 count, it. Is 
generally concodod, howovor, that 
Notro Daino has a great many more 
potentialities than they have shown 
so far. Carnegie Is Just as llablo 
as not to catch the team from the 
Hoosler state on the rebound. II! 
tho visitors prove to bo on tliolr 
game, It will tako a miracle to 
stop thom.
On tho other hand tho Oarnoglo 
linn 1ms shown lu the two gamos 
they have played, that It Is ono 
of tint sl.i'ongost In the country, 
and If the secondary holds up Its, 
ond, II. may bo another story al­
together. Coach Don Lovewell has 
done wonders with tho Plaid for­
ward wall In the brief period ho 
has had It under his tutelage.
The history of tho Oarnoglo 
Toch-Notre Dame series Is ono of 
tho most Interesting In Iho annals 
of Amorlcan football. Hlst,ory has 
boon made I11 many of the games 
between these two schools.
Carnegie clashed with the Roclc- 
ne machine for tho first time In 
1922, when tho latter Avon by a 19- 
0 count. For the next three years 
the results were very much alike, 
and ’So in 1926 the Notre Dame A. 
A. doclded that the Tartans were 
not fit competition for their stal­
warts and announced they were 
dropping the Pittsburghers from 
the schedule after the 1926 game. 
Carnegie was to meet the Irish in 
the season’s finale at Forbos Field. 
Rockne had a powerful array that 
year and entered the final game 
without a blemish on his record. 
The game looked so much in the 
bag that the great coach did not 
even bother to accompany his team 
but stayed in Chicago to watcli the 
Army-Navy struggle Instead. What 
the Plaid did to the Green that 
Saturday is now history.
Carnegie did not. play the Ram­
blers in 1927, but tlie Notre Dame 
hastily resigned the Skibos for a 
game in 1928. The series has never 
been interrupted since. On re­
newing the feud in 1928, the Tar-

Stirring Period in Carnegie’s Early 
History Inspired New Alma Mater
By ROY M I NET.
Traditions are said to grow slow­
ly. Carnegie, however, though 
younger than most colleges, has 
seemingly Ignored tills adage, for 
In what is actually a very short 
space of time It has built firmly 
behind It a strong’ body of living 
practices and customs. Progress 
was not made smoothly and with­
out effort; but with its growing 
unity and enthusiasm of spirit, 
needs an they developed drew tliolr 
solution from out of the same 
ardent energy which generated 
them. Against such a background 
of vigorous progress the Alma 
Mater grow.
The setting for the Introduction 
of tho present Alma Mater Is 
Carnegie as it. was back in the 
fall of 1915, back when the Mar­
garet Morrison co-eds harbored a 
dramatic club! Additions to the 
College of Fine Arts, then known 
as the School of Applied Design, 
were still under way; the Admin­
istration Building had just been
built, and additions to the Collogo 
of Industries had scarcely been 
completed. Only two men's dorm­
itories, McGill and Boss Halls, 
wore in existence; the gymnasium, 
the Carnegie Commons and tho 
Hut woro not to come Into being 
for a number of years.
Entrance to Carnegie could bo 
made only by way of Woodlawn 
avenue or over the bridge behind 
tho Carnegie Institute, for tho cut 
then consisted of a deep ravine 
and a ridged extension of the 
Brown property. Tho campus It­
self was not tho carefully planted 
and cared for plot that it Is now.
The year 1915 brought the first 
groat successful season for the 
Tartan football team when tho 
Steffen-coached machine scored 
smashing victories over Grove 
City, Western Reserve, Case, Al­
legheny, Thiel, Wayneslnirg and 
Hiram and suffered only one re­
verse, Pitt’s contribution to an 
otherwise undefeated season.

THE CARNEOTE TARTAN, TUESDAY. OCTOBER 17, 1933
Reveals His
Impressions
Discusses Comliüons 
In Germany During 
European Tour
NAZIS APPARENTLY 
FIRMLY INTRENCHED 
---------- I
Recent Academic Upheavals 
Detrimental to Advance 
of Science and Art
Pres. Bale er i iCopyooro ghtC
By Preoldent Baker
X have been asked by a represen­
tative of the Tartan to answer a 
fow quoBtioiiH concerning condi­
tion» In Germany. I hesitate to 
discuss a political condition in Ger­
many because my most recent trip 
to Europe was a very hurried one 
and was concorned with the secur­
ing ol' a very distinguished chem- 
iut and physicist for our Institute.
I therefore had very few opportuni­
ties of discussing politics and made 
no effort to increase these oppor­
tunities.
1. Do you tlilnlc the German 
people want war?
The nation as a nation does not 
¦want war but the tone and 
speeches of some of its leaders 
have a distinctly war-like quality. 
While the rank and file of the peo­
ple, I bellevo, desire peace, na­
tions witli self-seoking and unwise 
leaders are sometimes led to ex­
tremes of nationalism which make 
war a possibility.
2. Dd) you think that the expul­
sion and emigration of the Jews 
and many of the scientists, from 
Germany spell the end of her in­
tellectual and scientific leadership?
The upheaval In the universities, 
the art schools and the institutes 
of research lias already done much 
to check the progress of science 
and art. What will be the ulti­
mate effect ono does not and dare 
not prophesy but Germany has 
lost many of its most distinguish­
ed intellectuals. The English uni­
versities, Oxford, Cambridge, the 
University of London, Manchester, 
have secured a number of them. 
•The Belgian universities have in­
vited several to their country. The 
Dutch, South American, Russian 
and Scandinavian universities 
have boon eager to strengthen 
their faculties from this source.
;{. Have industrial conditions 
picked up? What do they think 
of our now doal?
The papers report decreasing un­
employment but 1 was told that the 
statistics concerning the labor sit­
uation could not. bo accepted at 
their face vlaue. Work is being 
croated artificially In many ways. 
I hom'd very little discussion of 
our "Now Deal” but occasionally it 
was said that our President, was 
borrowing some of Hitler's ideas. 
1 did not attempt to argue this 
question.
•I. Do you hoar any comment 
from Germany about those prol'os- 
ors leaving?
From some of I,ho so-called 
Aryan professors who aro still 
holding their positions l hoard ex­
pressions ol' dnop bitterness nnd 
groat rogroli at the unsottlemont 
of acndemle life, Tho men with 
whom I talked hold very gloomy 
views ol' tho rntui'o oi' Clerman 
Boloni-e. The general public knows 
very little about what In going on 
baamuio the comjowflilp <>r Ibo 
pros» Is so strict that nothing Is 
allowed l.o apponr that Is not dic­
tated or approved by tho govern­
ment.
5. Do youi think Hitler will on- 
duro?
Thoro Is nothing on tho horizon 
at. prosont which would make ono 
believe I hut Hitler and National 
Socialism will ho overturned In tho 
near future.
(>. I have hoard that tho so- 
called persecution of tho non- 
Aryans In Germany is an attempt 
to put Nazis Into tho big positions 
rather than simply an attempt to 
keep the race pure..
It. Is probable that envy and 
jealousy are elements in tho per­
secution of tho Jews. It is true 
that in somo departments ol! ac­
tivity tlio Jows had assumed a 
dominant role. This aroused bit­
terness. For ten years or more 
Hitler lmd been preaching anti- 
Semitism and as soon as he came 
into power this was one of the first 
of his doctrines to be applied, but 
there is little evidence of abate­
ment of anti-Semitic fee’ing.
7. You have progab’y seen a 
great deal of the universities. Are 
they rather upset by thiS emigra­
tion ?
Thore has been an over-supply 
of university men and it is prob­
able that all the vacancies in the 
universities that have been created 
have been or are being filled 
promptly; hut tho removal of some 
of the distinguished scholars has 
created a void that can hardly be 
filled.

IF you use lipstick—or if you really 
prefer a chocolate pecan sundae to 
a Scotch and soda—you might as 
well stop reading right at this point. 
ESQUIRE is not for you and you had 
better face the grim fact now.
If, however, you are a genuine 
male—if you have a healthy mascu­
line taste for good clothes and strong 
language—if you like the real inside 
on sports—if you’d rather read a 
brief saga by Ernest Hemingway 
than a sugar-coated tale of love in 
the suburbs—
In that case you will want to rush 
right out and get your copy of 
ESQUIRE before this first and some­
what limited issue is sold out.
For here, at last, is a man’s idea 
of a magazine come to life 1 Here are 
“short” short stories by such writers

Dashiell Hammett and Manuel Kom-

Here is humor by such a rollicking 
list as George S. Chappell, Montague 
Glass, Robert Buckner, George Ade, 
Harry Hershfield and David Monroe.
Here are 16 pages on what to wear 
and when to wear it—written for 
men who think that good tweed is 
something to be smelled with rever­

that be a help I Benny Leonard him­
self tells about Iialfc dozen fights for 
the lightweight championship that 
were never entered in the record

Never before, in fact, has such a 
list of contributors been gathered to­

there are forty pages in color includ­

Third Public 
Lecture Will 
Be Held Mon.
Dr. Calvert C ontinues 
Financial, Commercial 
Discussion Series
The third in the series of free 
public lectures entitled ''interpre­
tation of the Financial Commercial 
Tendencies Since 1914” will be 
given by Dr. W. J. Calvert, a New 
York business man and student of 
economics, Monday evening at 
,7:30 in Room 104. College of In­
dustries. In this lecture Dr. Cal­
vert will continuo his discussion 
of the financial and commercial 
developments in the three periods, 
1914-1921, 1921-1930, and 1930 to 
date.
Dr. Calvert singled out the year 
1914 as the time from which to 
gather material for his lectures 
because the financial and commer­
cial tendencies since that time 
utilize the major portion of the 
known principles of economics, al­
though often to an exaggerated 
degree. In the course of the lec­
tures lie intends to review, non- 
teclinically and briefly, some of 
the significant aspects of the more 
important principles and to give 
those interested the mechanism 
by which they can better under­
stand the causes, the effects, and 
the implications, of the financial 
and commercial movements as 
they appear. To this end, Dr. Cal­
vert includes the following sub­
jects in the lectures:
Capital: The origin of capital 
and the types oC capital consti­
tute one of the non-speculative 
principles on which modern civil­
ization is based, and they should 
be understood by every citizen. 
To this end, floating and fixed cap­
ital, their origin and implications, 
must be considered.
Man and the Man-Land Ratio: 
As man created capital, his capac­
ities and his limitations should be 
at least superficially understood, 
as they influence his relation to 
natural resources and the institu­
tion of capitalism. This relation­
ship is studied in the man-land 
ratio.
Purchasing Power: As the In­
dividual can produce only in 
limited quantities to supply his de­
sires, the capacity to procure 
things from *otliers is a necessity. 
This capacity is known as pur­
chasing power. Its origin, its 
limitations, and the way it is used 
are a part of the study of the man- 
land ratio.
The Standard of Value: In order 
to trade and traflic, humanity 
must have measures, which usual­
ly go under the name of weights 
and measures. They are instru­
ments of precision for the meas­
urements of value. This measure 
is called the standard of value. 
It will be discussed at some length 
because of its general significance 
and its unusual importance at the 
present time.

important forcesx determining the 
volume of trade. Its nature, its 
origin and types, and its relation 
to the individual, the government, 
and the banks will be discussed, 
special emphasis being put upon 
its use in expansion and inflation.
Banks: Banks are the institu­
tions which deal in credit and 
debt, and they facilitate the use 
of credit by the people. The fun­
damental principle of banking de- 
veoped during the period of the 
goldsmith-banks has been added to 
in the development of modern 
banking. The essential points of 
this evolution will be followed, 
especially the transformation of 
the National Banks into the mem­
ber banks, and the general princi­
ples of the Federal Reserve Banks.
Money: Money is the medium of 
exchange, that is, it is the trans­
portation system by which value 
is transported from one person to 
another, precisely as a railroad 
transports commodities from one 
place to another. Money as an 
instrument will be considered, 
and the general principles govern­
ing its volume and circulation will 
be described.
Price: Price and value, in a 
broad general sense, are syn­
onymous. Their detailed relation­
ship will be shown, and the causes 
of the fluctuation in the level of 
prices will be discussed.
Inflation: The three outstanding 
periods of inflation, the John Law 
Mississippi scheme, the assignats 
of the French Revolution, and the 
German inflation from 1918 to 
1924, will be considered briefly, to 
bring out the philosophy underly­
ing the willingness of the people 
to accept worthless money in 
times of trouble. The activities of 
John Law which entitled him to 
be given the title of “The Prince 
of Pied Pipers of Inflation” will 
be specially mentioned.
Managed currency will be dis­
cussed under the Standard of 
Value along with the principles of 
the standard of value, the stabili­
zation of the price of gold, the 
principles of the stabilization of 
commodity prices, and bi-metal- 
lism. Foreign exchange, the in­
ternational aspects of the gold 
standard, along with the major 
general principles on which social­
ism, bolshevism, and communism 
»vp based will also be mentioned.

Close Observation, Imagery,

Revealed in Play
The coming production of “The 
Field God,” by Paul Green, which 
will open in the Little Theater un­
der the direction of Prof. Chester 
Wallace on the evening of October 
27 for a run of six nights, promises 
to be interesting not only because 
of its own merit, but because it 
is such a representative comment­
ary of its author’s'tastes, tempera­
ment and particular genius.
Paul Green, the son of a farmer,, 
was born near Lillington, North 
Carolina, in 1894. Much of his 
understanding of the kinds of per­
sons, white and black, that he puts 
into his plays was gotten during 
the first 20 years of his life as 
he worked on his father’s farm. H& 
graduated from a neighboring- 
academy after irregular schooling,, 
taught school for two years and 
entered the University of North 
Carolina in 1916. A year later her 
joined the army and after two* 
years of service in France he re­
turned to the university, from 
which he graduated in 1921. He- 
now teaches philosophy there.
Probably his first impulse to ex­
press his deep-seated and native- 
interests in the form of drama, 
came while lie wau a student at 
the university when he took the- 
course in playwriting given by- 
Prof. Frederick H. Koch, the di­
rector of the Carolina Playmakers- 
He is essentially a folk dramatist,, 
but one of those who exploit new 
fields. His own especial field is 
that of the rural white people and? 
negroes of his own state.
His five long plays and more- 
than 30 one-act plays range through 
perhaps every known type of pres­
ent-day drama—force, travesty,, 
comedy, fantasy, melodrama ancE 
tragedy in many moods—by meth­
ods that vary from pure natural­
ism to pure fantasy.
Like O’Neill, Green is a close? 
observer who is sincerely inter­
ested in surfaces only as they re­
veal underlying motives and mean­
ings. I-Ie insists upon expressing: 
himself in his own way with no 
thought of pandering to an audi­
ence.
I-Ie has the insight into charac­
ter and the sympathy and imagina­
tion of a poet, and he has a fairly 
sure sense of dramatic situation. 
Technically, he is sometimes guilty* 
of loose ends and labored speeches 
that do not ring quite true; some 
times he unnecessarily clogs his 
action with words. The words in 
themselves, however, are almost al-

Nazis Hinder 
Education, Say 
German Profs.
Scientists Are on Campus 
Alter Flight From 
Hitler Regime
College education In Germany 
ban received a decided sot-back as 
a result of tho Hitler nationalistic 
regime declared Prof. I. Ester- 
mann, who with Dr. Otto Stern ar­
rived on tho campus lust week to 
loin tho faculty of the College of 
Engineering.
Professor Estermann and Dr. 
Stern aro two of the three Inter­
nationally famous scientists who 
President Baker persuaded to leave 
Germany where they had been 
severely persecuted by tho Nazis 
and como to the more peaceful 
America. Tho other professor, Dr. 
Ernst Berl, has been on the campus 
since the beginning of this semes­
ter.
“German universities have been 
markod by an unrestricted freedom 
In learning and In teaching,'’ said 
Professor Estermann. “There has 
been no compulsion as to what the 
student should study or the pro­
fessor teach. Both were left.to the 
Individual will.”
With tho change in regime com­
pulsion has been introduced. Of­
ficers of the student bodies, who 
have tho power to direct the cur­
ricular schedule, are appointed by 
some unknown governmental 
agency. Physical training, almost 
military in nature, occupies much 
of the student's time, and certain 
other classes advocated by Nazi 
leaders are now compulsory.
A reliable index to conditions in 
Germany even today was given 
when both men declined to specu 
late upon the possibility that Hit­
ler's course will provoke another 
war. “Such speculation is too 
dangerous,” Dr. Stern declared. 
‘‘It would react against relatives 
and friends.’’
Both agreed, however, that the 
apparently pointless course of the 
Nazis has crippled Gqj’inany's scl 
entlflc leadership. The I-Iltlei 
party, they said, seems not to care 
about the fate of science, It Is un­
concerned about Increasing the 
limits of man’s knowledge, excepi 
of course, where the Investigation! 
being carried on have a military 
value.
In answering a question about 
conditions In Germany, Dr. Steri 
said, ‘‘I could not stand seeing my 
Jewish friends persecuted. I de 
ckled to como to Carnegie bocaust 
1 was assured by Dr. Baker that 1 
would liavo tho utmost freedom 
and tho host of facilities with 
which to continue my scientific re­
search.”
Both Dr. Stern and Dr. Ester- 
liiann have boon In tills country 
before, Dr. stern for a yoar and 
n half as visiting lecturer at the 
University of California and Dr 
Estormnnn working In tho ohom 
Istry dopiirtmont of tho sumo uni 
vi rility for four months. 'I'hls 
flnio I,hoy plan to remain In Amer­
ica pornmnontly and to take out 
citizenship papers.
When power surges sign tkeirnamcs,it’snofor- 
gery. The signature shows true wave shapes 
and phase delations. And, best of all, the 
PM-13 is permanently connected in the circuit 
and runs by itself.
Incidentally, Claude Hathaway, a U. of 
Colorado graduate in 1927, is largely respon­
sible for this new development.
GERMAN SCIENTISTS ARRIVE

Dr. Stern, eminent German scientist, is shown being greeted by

BEMOTOItED BEHEMOTHST
HE same sun which never sets on an 
unsliaved Englishman’s chin likewise 
never finishes its daily round without seeing 
electric motors put to some new use.
In the Sinclair Refining Company’s exhibit at 
“A Century of Progress,” you can see five pre­
historic monsters. Largest is a Brontosaurus, 
70 ft. long and 22 ft. high, with a steel skeleton 
and welded joints, posing on a mountain. 
Little motors operate his eyelids, head, neck, 
mouth, breathing apparatus, and tail. A motor­
ized Tyrannosaurus rocks back and forth, 
blinking and running out liis tongue. A 30- 
foot Triceratops lunges forward; a Stegosaurus 
waves his fins; and a Duck-billed dinosaur sits 
in a lake and churns water with his tail. 
Interviewed recently, and speaking for the 
group, Brontosaurus shrewdly Asduked an eye 
and recommended G-E motors, on the basis of 
hia 00 million years of experience.

When the storm king rules roughshod along

oscillograph waits to see tho whites of his

possible by a special little mirror with a move­
ment all its own. On a single roll of the 
sensitized paper, PM-13 can handle as many 
as a hundred oscillograms of chance transients 
and surges, and they can tread right on one 
ano tlier’s heels or follow months apart.

"The Prevention of Corrosion in 
Industry” was the subject of a lec­
ture given by Fr«d E. Eckart, en­
gineer of the A. M. Byers Company 
of Pittsburgh, at the weekly chem­
ical seminar last Wednesday. Mr. 
Eckart reviewed the chemical re­
search on corrosion of recent years 
and compared .the service records 
of the various antt-corrosion steels 
and alloys on the market with 
wrought iron as manufactured by 
the A. M. Byers Company.
Although there is probably no 
chemical subject on which there 
has been more research—by both 
educational Institutions and indus­
trial plants — corrosion of pipes, 
tubes, and chemical apparatus is 
still an unsettled problem for en­
gineers. In fact laboratory experi­
ments, and especially the acceler­
ated tests by which the substances 
are subjected to attack by acids, 
often predict the opposite corro­
sive-resisting properties which ac­
tual tests in ‘he field prove the 
metals or alloys to have. To Illus­
trate, Mr. Eckart cited tho example 
of the Rochester, N. Y., water sys­
tem by which for 28 years the city 
water has been carried through a 
wrought, iron pipe. Five years ago, 
because of the nocesslty of Increas­
ing the water supply, a steel pipe— 
supposedly corrosive-resisting by 
laboratory test—was installed par­
allel to the wrought Iron pipe. 
After a recent examination tho 
steel pipe was found to havo 788 
pits r.s comparod to 50 for tho or­
iginally Installed wrought Iron 
pipe.
The excellent corrosive-resisting 
properties of wrought iron, Mr. 
Eckart explained, Is due to (1) tho 
high purity of the Iron (approxi­
mately 99.84%), and (2) tho oc­
cluded slag. Tho A. M. Byors Com­
pany now manufacturers wrought, 
Iron on a large scalo by a method 
Invented by Profossor Aston, head 
of tho dopartmont of Mining and 
Metallurgy.
Mr. Eckart omphasl/.od that tho 
most satisfying provontlon of cor­
rosion llos In the strict ndheronco 
to tho following procoduros: (a) 
treating tho water which ilows 
through tho mains of bailor with 
the proper chemicals, (b) soloct- 
InR tho proper matorlal, and (c) 
tho proper Installation of tho ma­
terial,
National loaders in metallurgical 
research will assemble here Friday 
for the seventh annual open meet­
ing of the Metallurgical Advisory 
Board. Reports of research activi­
ties at Carnogie will be made by 
Investigators and will be discussed 
by exports from tho industry, thus 
furnishing a valuable Interchange 
of opinion between the theoretical 
and practical side of stool making.
Joromo Strauss, chief research 
engineer of the Vanadium Corpor- 
poratlon, will preside over the

In llin evening an Informal din-
Alma Mater Inspired 
By Carnegie History
Continued From Pace 1
Born on this rising tide came 
the desire for an alma mater 
written entirely by and for Car- 
negians. Up until this time the 
alma mater had been half and 
half; the words had been written 
by a Carnegie professor, but they 
were being.,sung to the music of 
the Austrian National Anthem. It 
was at this time that a second 
member of the faculty came into 
the story.
Prof. J. Vick O'Brien, head of 
the Department of Music, 'was in­
itiated that important year into 
one of the local campus frater­
nities, the name of which he can 
no longer recall. The resulting 
intimate association with the stu­
dents in their activities gave Pro­
fessor O’Brien the “feeling of tho 
campus,” as he expresses it. In 
this understanding of student life 
his experience was very much like 
that of the man who had already 
written the words of our present 
Alma Mater, Prof. Charles J. Tay­
lor, then head of the Department 
of Painting and Design. Professor 
Taylor, who died in 1929, was prob- 
obly one of the most popular in­
structors among the students ever 
to teach at Carnegie.
Professor O’Brien took the words 
of the old Alma Mater as written 
by Professor Taylor, and, using 
Haydn’s melody as a model, com­
posed the music we now use. The 
new Alma Mater was tried out by 
the Glee Club; it took, and soon 
grew in favor.
Thus it was that two men, mem­
bers of tho faculty, who were closo 
to the students both In their work 
and In their play, fashioned tho 
song we sing today to express fbr 
Carnegie, as it stands enthroned 
upon the hilltops, the same kind 
of reverent affection as that which 
was horn in the hearts of thoso 
early Carnegians, members of tho 
clan who have passed the Tartan 
on to be borne upon new shoulders.

Although the iuea or "Play for 
Play’s Sake” is the basis of or­
ganized sport under the W. A. A., 
certain rewards are given to those 
who take an active part in the 
various sports. “An active part” 
means selecting the sports you are 
interested in and arranging your 
time to include the practice periods 
and games. Before you find that 
your time is completely taken up, 
read through the following list of 
sports and decide which ones you 
art} going to be in. In order to 
give real significance to the W. A. 
A. awards, the sports have been 
divided into major and minor 
classes and a set number of points 
given for each. The “C” is the 
highest award of all and is given, 
with the approval of the W. A. A. 
board, to those who earn 1,000 
points. A pin is given for 800 and 
class numerals for 400.
Major sports include:
Hockey, season October and No­
vember; points, 100 points for mak­
ing team and attending one-half 
of practices; 75 points for attend­
ing two-thirds of practices.
Bowling, season November 14 
through six weeks; points, 100 
points for making team and roll­
ing 20 lines; 75 points for rolling 
20 lines and reaching semi-finals; 
50 points for rolling 20 lines.
Basketball, season December 1 to 
March 1; points, 100 points for 
making team and attending one- 
half of practices; 75 points for at­
tending two-thirds, and 50 for at­
tending one-half.
Rifle, season all year; points, 125 
points for first five high scores; 
100 points for second high scdres; 
75 for two practices a week, and 
50 for one practice a week.
The Tartan cross-country team 
will officially open its running sea- 
s6n in a meet against the visiting 
Irish next Saturday morning at 
eleven o’clock in Schenley Park. 
The harriers had their trials for 
eligibility last Saturday, and put 
the names of seven" men, mostly 
well seasoned, on the roll-call. 
Allan, who is captain, Schell, 
Giolma, Ramsey, Neff, Burke, and 
Netzer will run over the hill for 
the Skibos. Schell and Ramsey, 
ex-captains of the cross-country 
teams of _ previous years, add 
strength to the team with a wealth 
of running experience. Additional 
men may find themselves eligible 
for the harrier team in the near 
future.
The Tartan runners have no 
record of smashing victory from 
previous meets with Notre Dame. 
The score of the meet held at 
Notre Dame last year was 37 to 14, 
favor of the Irish. Bob Schell 
maintained his reputation as a 
runner by finishing third in that 
meet, but other Tech runners 
trailed behind. This year, with 
the best running material Tech 
has ever been able J.o obtain, and 
a number of salty runners re­
tained from past years, the Tar­
tans should and will create a more 
balanced score against the excel­
lent Irish.
The cross-country meet against 
Notre Dame will be held on the 
Clan’s running grounds, starting at 
the bottom of Flagstaff Hill, cov­
ering a course throughout Schenley 
Park, and finishing at the starting 
point. It will initiate a schedule 
of five attractive meets which the 
crosscountry team plans to execute 
with no mean degree of success 
during this running season. The 
team will meet Geneva at Geneva 
the week following.
Stewart’s Field Goal 
Final Period Bring 
Decidine Score
Future Foes of Coach 
Harpster’s Machine 
Display Power
Future opponents of Coach 
HarpsLer grid machine met with 
indifferent success during the past 
week. Several of them won quite 
impressively, while others were 
either upset or left breathing with 
difficulty.
Notre Dame again found the go­
ing extremely rough, although 
many believe that the P«.amblers’ 
opponents are better than they 
have been rated. The Irish ob­
tained a 12 to 2 victory over the 
Hoosiers in last week’s game, 
showing further evidence to the 
fact that Coach Anderson has 
again produced a team of superior 
footballers, perhaps the best since 
ICnute Rockne's glorious team of 
1930. The Irish are favored to win 
next Saturday. There is but one 
thing which can stop them—the 
spirit which we have known the 
Tartans to possess in past en­
counters, against which no team 
is invincible.
Fans of W. & J. were disappoint­
ed when Detroit beat the Presi­
dents 14 to 0 in a game last week. 
An „opportunity to qualify the 
brand of ball handled by the Detroit 
club will be offered this week 
when the Detroiters meet the 
Dukes this week here in Pitts­
burgh. The Tartan gridders will 
meet the Prexies the Saturday fol­
lowing the Notre Dame game, at 
Pittsburgh.
One of the toughest games on 
the Tartan schedule is that with 
Purdue. Purdue is rated as one 
of the strongest teams of the coun­
try, and is given the odds by quite 
a margin in comparison with the 
Tech team. But a 7 to 7 tie 
startled footballdom last week 
when Minnesota held Purdue in an 
equal battle, although the club 
from Lafayette were rated as easy 1 
favorites to win. Minnesota, how­
ever, has a reputation for turning 
out teams of no mean grid ability, 
and the upset really casts no re­
flections on the quality of the Pur­
due team.
Another surprise to the football 
world was executed in the Michi­
gan State-Illinois Wesleyan game. 
The Wesleyans were defeated, but 
they held the strong State team to 
a 20 to 12 score. Michigan State 
is reputed as a first-rate team, and 
Carnegie Tech will encounter diffi­
culty in balancing a score against 
the northern team, despite the
conclusions which might be drawn 
from the results of the game fight 
put up by the Illinois team.
Undoubtedly a breathing space 
will be offered between the hard 
games of the Tartan schedule, in 
the form of Georgetown U. at 
Washington. The Georgetown
gridders were humiliated to the 
extent of a 20 to 20 tie in a game 
last week against the comparative­
ly weak eleven from Manhattan. 
This breather will perhaps be ex­
tended by a tilt with N. Y. U. the 
week following the Tech-George-
town game, for to all appearances 
the Now York club has little to 
show as favorable over the Tar­
tans, save a sorely over-worked
jinx. The University was barely 
able to eke a victory from the 
Lafayette team, which held them 
fo the narrow margin of 13 to 12.
And well may the Tartans use a 
rest, for a period of tough games 
will have just preceded, and por-
ON RETURNING FROM CINCINNATI SUNDAY the Tartan warriors 
paid tribute to a valiant Xavlor team for the great game they put 
up lant Saturday. Tho Muskotocro prosontcd an able crow of grldmen, 
and thoy made tho powerful Carnegie eleven step cv.ery Inch of the 
way. The Ohloano had two great tackle« and an unusually speedy 
backflold. Their punting, however, wan their real forte, Pennington's 
boots going from GO to 70 yarda moat of tho game. Croft'c kicking was 
greatly Improved over tho Temple game, and he matched hIb opponents’ 
booto moot of tho afternoon.
“Rod” Stowart’o beautiful placement should chut up uome of uo 
wine-crackero around here who arc constantly riding the Lorain boy for 
his timely misses of points after touchdown.

JOHN ANDERSON IS TRYING VERY HARD TO WEAR OUT his old 
title (see A. P. F. In next Puppet for particulars), and is now endeavor­
ing to become known as "Carnegie’s best dressed guard.” Mr. Ander­
son entrained l’or Cincinnati arrayed in dark double-breasted suit with 
light gray trport vest, derby hat, and a hard-boiled collar. Incidentally 
the Washington youth remained over in the Ohio city for a few days, 
lr without a doubt tho week-end was not a complete washout for the 
Cincinnati citizenry.* * + i» * *
FOR THE PAST WEEK THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER of raspber-
riea thrown In my general direction on account of that head that ap- 
poarod over a story about the swimming team in last week’s Tartan. 
It seems as if the printers had great difficulty in deciphering my print­
ing and got tho word "Trackmen” instead of "Tankmen.”
Tartan Rum ing Attack is 
Spasmodic; Line PJays 
Brilliantly Again
Carnegie maintained Its unbeaten 
stride by the narrow margin of a 
field goal over Xavier in one of 
the hardest fought battles the Tar­
tans have run into In a long time. 
For an underdog the Cincinnati 
team put up one of the best ex­
amples of unexpectedly Lough op­
position that any of the gridders 
from this section have had on their 
iiands for many a season.
After the terrible Juggernaul- 
fashion crushing the Plaid gave 
Temple on the previous Saturday, 
the Musketeers were expected to be 
easy going for Coacii I-Iarpster’s 
boys. However the going was far 
from easy and turned out to be a 
good object lesson to prove the 
Carnegie mentor's statement be­
fore the game—that a hard fight­
ing underdog is a far more danger­
ous opponent than a confident top- 
notch er.
The Tartans played in an indif­
ferent manner throughout the 
game, and refused to Lake the game 
seriously till if. was almosL too 
late, in Lhe meantime the Xavier 
team had worked up Lo playing 
with such a fanatical fury tliaL the 
Plaid found them very much re­
sembling a brick wall when they 
tried any offensive plays. In con- 
trast lo llieir brillianl defense, 
Liieir allaclcs on Lhe Carnegie goal 
were comparalively weak.
One of Lhe oulsLanding feaLures 
of Lhe game was Lhe punling. Be- 
Lween Crofl, of Tech, and Penning- 
Lon, of Lhe Muskeleers, Lhe old 
pigskin did quiLe a loL of travel­
ing back and fort.li across Lhe field. 
In 1’acL, it might easily have turned 
into a session of up five, back five.
The defense was also supreme. 
BoLli Loams were so primed llial 
in spile of Llieir best efforls neilher 
one could quite shovo their way 
over that last chalk line. Against 
such good repulsive play, any of­
fensive effort was negligible.
The blocking was terrible and 
after Oapt. Red Stewart’s day-sav­
ing kick, when Pennlnglon’s punts 
wont down dose Lo Lhe Tarlan goal 
Hovovlno refused lo gamble with 
thorn and lot Lliem all roll, sitting 
on Ills slim load willi tho enro of 
a molherly lion.
Durzlo was tho outstanding lines­
man on l.lio Hold. Ca,pL. Stewart, 
afLor playing a groat game Lhrough- 
out, had to leave the game bo- 
cauao of an injury, for tho firsL 
in his college career.

Fine Student, 
Line Plunger
Sayles Looking Forward 
to Greatest Year; 
Is 5.0 Scholar
Johnny Sayles, hard-hilLIng full­
back on the Tech sauad, from 
Wheeling, is a man who combines 
scholarship with alhletics. Sayles 
starLed on the Wheeling, W. Va., 
team, entering Carnegie in 1930. 
He was regular fullback on Lhe 
Freshman Leam his firsL year, bul 
has been handicapped by injuries 
Lo. Lhe exLenL LhaL Lhis is his firsl 
year as regular varsity fullback. 
Sayles is a notoriously hard-hit- 
Ling back, usually leaving a trail 
of maimed opponents in his wake. 
On the defense he is a good line­
backer and consistent stopper of 
hard plungers.
In scholarship Sayles is up 
among the leaders in Lhe qchool. 
He is also prominenL in Lhe, acliv- 
iLies of Lhe school. Johnny is a 
member of Tau Bela Pi, li'ighesl 
honorary sociely in collegiale en­
gineering; presidenL of Lhe senior 
class In Lhe College of Engineer­
ing, presidenL of Lhe Carnegie y. 
M. C. A. cabinet and a member of 
the Dragons, senior honorary so­
ciety.
The liigli spots in his football 
career aro many. In high school 
he was an All-West Virginia half­
back. His first season of varsity 
collegiate football was topped off 
when he made Tecli’s only touch­
down in the Pitt game that Car­
negie losL, 14-6. He also scored a 
touchdown on a pass against N. 
Y. U.
Wilhout a doubt this will bo 
Sayles’ biggest year and he may 
be depended upon Lo come Lhrough 
well. He is' one of Lhe big guns 
in the Tarlan lmckfleld and with 
lhe slrong line of tills year's squad 
should be able to do much willi 
his bullet-like line plunging. Harp­
ster is depending groally on lhe 
Whoeling lad and Johnny will un­
doubtedly be a big factor in what­
ever success the Plaid gridiron 
machine atlains this year. Sayles 
himself predicts a great season and 
places Implicit confidence in tho 
ability of Carnegie’s now coaching 
si a ft Lo make tills a banner year in 
Tartan's pigskin history.

COACH RISEDORPI-I IS BICMOANING THE LOSS OF HIS GREAT 
FREESTYLEll, Pal Millor, who graduated last June afler shattering 
most of the school and pool records in his specialties. Miller was usu­
ally good for an average of aboul 12 poinls a meet, and iL will be some 
Lime before he can he ably replaced. The Tarlan Tank Chief is mighly 
lhankful that ho has his oLhar Lwo consIsLenL winners, Ranny Boyer 
and Julian von dor Lancken, back In Lhe fold. Boyer holds several 
world’s records In Lhe back sLroke, and von der Lancken has few peers 
in this district when It conies Lo rolling off/Lhe breast slrolce. Grilles 
have been much pieasod willi Bill Holliday of last year's freshman 
team, who is showing class In both lhe back stroke and Lhe free slyle. 
All in all, Mr. Risedorpli shouldn't have loo much to be gloomy about.
Call for hreshman 
Swimming Candidates
All freshmen with any swim­
ming ability at all are urged to 
report in the Trophy room of the 
Gymnasium tomorrow at 5 
o’clock. Swimming is one of 
Carnegie’s youngest sports and 
efforts are being made to de­
velop It into a major activity. 
The freshmen will swim against 
local schools and numerals are 
awarded to those making the 
required number of points.
WHETHER OR NOT CARNEGIE IS GOING TO HAVE A BOXING 
TEAM this yoar still seems to be an unsolved mystery. I tried to get 
the manager to write uo a story about It, but he seems to be just as 
much In tho dark as I am. Boxing Is a comparatively new sport on 
thlo campus, and Its standing at the present time is rather doubtful. 
There was a lot of adverse criticism last year, most of It untrue, but it 
is true that this school Is handicapped by a lack of experienced mate­
rial. One thing about the oport here is that the boxers haye always 
had the advantage of excellent coaching, training, and care. Mr. Scsto 
has always endeavored to keep tho welfare of the boxers and the sport 
itself foremost In mind. Wo hope that he will be able to make some 
satisfactory arrangements with tho athletic moguls before long.
haps the toughest will follow but 
five days after the trip to New 
York, when Harpster’s machine- 
wili match wits with Sutherland’s 
Panthers on Thanksgiving Day. 
The Pitt Panthers leave no ques­
tion in our minds as being a team 
of outslanding quality. With com­
parative ease they wrested a 34 to 
6 victory from the Navy deck. 
The final score was made by the 
third team, which indicates the 
fund of material with which SuLli- 
erland has Lo work. Pitt-Tecli 
rivalry will reach a head in this 
game, and the energy of each fac- 
tor will be goaded on lo furious 
batlling by recollections of the 
nearness, or equality, of scores in 
the past few years. There will be 
no point on which either Leam will 
be well-informed concerning the 
other, so It will be a battle royal, 
of wits and of the spiril which sur­
rounds each of Lhe Learns within 
its own domain.

Idle Thoughts 
of an 
Idle Night 
Student
It is lots of fun to be dodging 
round, having everyone trying to 
d out your identity, speaking in 
hispers, etc. I get a tlirill out of 
of it and I am glad that I have 
ieen able to reserve my identity 
!or the past three issues. The 
vorst is over and I am sure that 
;he remainder of the year will find 
ill those inquisitive minds still in 
the dark. I am glad that I am a 
mystery and hope to continue thus 
and so.
However, let me introduce my­
self—or rather my new dress. 
Notice the “head,” sort of new for 
this column, don't you think? Of 
course, yours truly has nothing to 
say about the style of architecture, 
length of material, or whatever 
else which goes to make up the 
paper. All I do is. to write and 
send in the copy “in cog" each 
week. I am always in the dark, 
which is a foregone conclusion, 
since I don’t know how much 
space is available, etc., etc.
• I have measured a column of the 
¡^Tartan and it is just so long. I 
«accordingly write my little ditties, 
¦ always the full length, so you can 
1 imagine my feelings when the 
«shears start to work as the paper 
I goes to press. Now from a poor 
I scribe’s point of view it is dis- 
Iccaraging not to see all one’s ef- 
I forts rewarded, but then the pub- 
1 lie must be served, so I have to be 
»satisfied. Therefore, in subsequent 
¦issues, when you see the column 
[of varied lengths, you will know 
¡that I had nothing to do with it.
I suppose you received your little 
[)red book—Night Student Carnegie 
Handbook. Surely a fine little 
ftvolume to present to the night 
Rstudents. Lots of fine information 
f contained therein. The editor, 
I Chester Biscup, is to be commend- 
f ed for such a fine piece of work 
I and congratulated > upon the suc­
cessful manner in which he assem- 
[ bled all the material. I would feel 
; lost if I didn’t receive one of these 
I little books each year I am out. I 
I hope all the night students feel as 
pi do and that they read the book. 
) Did you notice the number of 
\blank pages for notes and things? 
IwVelI done, Mr. Editor.
l\ The Kilties are coming. Did you 
jOee them? Well they surely do 
/ lake a great showing at the 
/ames. And how they strut their 
stuff. The proudest one of them 
seems to be the Drum Majoi— 
watch him strut and prance. Wish 
I could find the time to play my 
[ bugle I would surely sign up the 
hand right away. But then I am 
ionly an idle night student.
And, I suppose you noticed the 
band last week in their new 
badges. Did you see how they 
sparkled on the field. I tell you 
[these boys know how to swing 
:heir kilts. With this new addl- 
on they are surely knockouts, 
ou know, the band is one of the 
igh spots of the football games 
ir me and I should like to see our 
i^nd two thousand strong, 
^ouldn’t we be the talk of the 
Vuntry?
Well, here we are, celebrating 
v/enty-five years of college life, 
'lie old grads are coming back for 
[on old fashioned hand shake and 
renewing of old acquaintances. 
¡My but they will find a change on 
¡the edge of Schenley. Where a 
few mud holes, or sumpin, existed 
in years gone by these are now re­
placed by fine buildings, labs, and 
other accessories. Wish I could be 
a grad and return some day to the 
old Alma Mater, you can bet I 
would throw out my chest. Any­
way, welcome to the old grads and 
all the grads who are returning for 
the homecoming this week-end. I 
know there will be a large turn­
out of this branch of the student 
body.

Council Changes 
Social Calendar
To avoid conflicts with the Day- 
School social calendar, several 
changes in the social calendar of 
the Night Student Council were 
necessary.
The College of Fine Arts Dance 
scheduled for February 17 was 
changed to February 10 and the 
second dance of this college, sched­
uled for April 2S was changed to 
April 7. Both changes were made 
to break up the succession of 
three night school dances on con­
secutive week-ends. In addition, 
the Inter-Night School Dance 
scheduled for May 12 conflicted 
with the plans for the Spring Car­
nival and the date for this func­
tion has been changed to May 5.
Note of these changes should be 
made in your handbook now so 
that there will be no misunder­
standings in the future. Be sure 
to make a careful note of these 
changes so that you will be sure to 
attend all of these functions. If 
you miss one of them, you will be 
missing the good time that every­
one has at these affairs.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT our contemporary, the 
idle Night Student, 'fya please, 
has gone high hat and now 
sports a new head, part of the 
New Deal, we suppose.
THAT last year’s ninht art’s 
queen is back again and will no 
doubt be very much in the run­
ning this year, for, my dear 
Genevieve, her beauty has not 
dimmed one whit. Hello, Ber­
nice, why doncha come up some 
time?
THAT several old timers who 
have been missing the last few 
years are back again, old man 
depression took a sock on the 
jaw no doubt. Welcome back, 
boys, once a Carneqie man al­
ways a Carnegie man. (Dr. Bak­
er please note, mail check at 
once.)
THAT students are still reg­
istering but my, oh my, is the 
front office popular.
THAT several students are 
trying out for the three open 
staff positions. Heh, heh, you 
should see how some back up 
when they are told about the re­
quirements. Naw, Mike, they 
ain’t got any internal fortitude, 
cause it’s easy, look what I get 
away with. (Please Mr. Editor,
I was only fooling.)
THAT Friday and Saturday 
will see some stirrinq times 
with two schools electing col­
lect* officers. If all the gas 
snilled were collected It wocld 
fill the wor'd’s largest dirigible 
and leave plenty for reserve. 
Oh well, that’s politics.
THAT the enqineers' smoker 
will be somethinq to talk about, 
and will I be there, don’t be 
ludi—luciro, I mean funny.
THAT so far no stirring orn- 
tions have been delivered con­
cerning the campus horses and 
their assistants, those iron 
cha!ns.
THAT parkinq space Is still 
at a premium and the street car 
service is so good that we have 
time to take in a movie between 
cars. That may be slightly ex­
onerated. but I mean that 
things are not so hot and win­
ter on'v around the corner.
THAT a couple of night stu­
dents desiqned those metal 
hickeys the Kilty band wears. 
Take a bow bovs. Just goes to 
show how versatile we night 
students are.
THAT lectures concerning fi­
nances are to be given every 
Monday ninht, quess the entire 
day and ninht hodv will attend 
and get the low-down on this 
moot question.
THAT araduat.e day students 
are getting a break by being al­
lowed to reg!ster for any course 
they desire free of charge, some 
day n'nht school will be Uto­
pian a'so. so cheer up.
THAT this is nettinq tiresome,, 
so I quess we better quit before 
somebody shoots us.
THAT that's that and I’ll be 
seenya.
II STEP F
The ambitious student, look­
ing ahead to a successful ca­
reer in.- business or profes­
sion, will find that a connec­
tion with a reputable bank­
ing institution is a real step 
forward. P!an to make such 
a connection while you are 
in college — the Mel'on Na­

Art?, Engineers 
Hold Elections 
Friday and Sat.
The annual election of officers 
for two of the night colleges will 
take place this Friday and Satur­
day evening.
The Night College of Fine Arts 
will hold its election of officers on 
Friday evening, the time and place 
of which will be posted on the bul­
letin boards of the college. The 
Night College of Engineering will 
hold an election on Saturday even­
ing in conjunction Avith a smoker 
in the Carnegie Union. Admission 
to the smoker is free and will be 
gained upon pi*esentation of your 
registration card.
At both of these elections the 
president, vice president, secre­
tary and treasurer of each college 
are to be elected. The officers 
thus elected will become members 
of the Night Student Council and 
represent their college in that 
body.
Each night student should refer 
to his copy of the night student 
Handbook regarding night school 
elections. His attention is particu­
larly directed to page 16 and other 
adjacent pages of the handbook 
covering qualifications and pro­
cedure of college elections.
Nighl Students Get 
Tartan Through Mail
Beginning with this issue of the 
Tartan a copy of each week’s issue 
will be mailed to all night students 
who have paid the night school 
activities fee. Due to changes of 
address caused by students moving 
from place to place, the mailing 
list is constantly being revised, 
and the task of keeping it up to 
date is a difficult one. Students 
can be of much assistance by ad­
vising the Plaid Staff at any time 
that they may change their ad­
dress.
All night students are entitled 
to a copy of the Tartan, and in 
order to insure getting your copy, 
you are asked to advise the staff 
of any change in address or of any 
failure to receive your copy._______

Night Engineers 
To Hold Smoker 
In Union Sat.
The first smoker of the Night 
College of Engineering will be 
hold in the Union Saturday even­
ing, October 21. This smoker will 
bo the first function of the en­
gineers for (his school year, and a 
good turnout Is expected. In lceep- 
ing with the program for the past 
years, the officers promise the' 
usual lino entertainment that 
everyone has enjoyed so much at 
previous smokers. In addition to 
the entertainment provided a lunch 
will he served. The best feature 
of it all (what with the depression, 
and everything) is the fact that It 
is all free. All that Is required for 
admission is your registration 
card. Only students of the Col­
lege of Engineering will be ad­
mitted, and it is hoped that every- 
ono who possibly can will attend.
Points toward an Insignia can be 
earned by those wishing to do so 
by turning out Saturday afternoon 
to aid in preparations for the 
smoker. These voluntary workers 
will meet in the Union at three 
o’clock Saturday afternoon, Octo­
ber 21, and will aid in getting 
everything ready for the big even­
ing. As it is necessary for all 
those attempting to earn an In­
signia to obtain some of their 
points by working at functions of 
their own college, this will be an 
opportunity for those engineers 
who are interested to get started 
towards that pin.

Handboo . Valuable to 
Old and New Students
The new students on the campus 
who have never attended classes 
at Carnegie before will find the 
Night Student Handbook invalu­
able in aiding themselves to get 
oriented. Published as it is by tho 
Night Student Council, tho Hand­
book contains nothing but authori­
tative information concerning 
many things of interest both to tho 
now student and the “old-timers."
Tho Social Calendar alone will 
prove invaluable in laying out 
your time when providing sufficient 
leisure time for your relaxation. 
Mpst of us have to plan at least a 
week or two ahead t.o bo able to 
take an infrequent "night-off," 
and having such a calendar at 
hand will enable tho student to 
plan his recreations on the campus 
for some time ahead. Use tho 
handbook to answer the questions 
that will frequently arise, too, for 
it will answer practically any ono 
of them that is apt to come to your 
attention.

Alumni Home-Coming
We welcome to Carnegie our graduates who will return to 
their Alina Mater next Friday to celebrate Annual Home-Com­
ing. Fond memories will be stirred as they walk across the 
campus and through the halls that they traversed in their under­
graduate days. A program full of interesting events has been 
arranged and Carnegie will do everything possible to assure a 
real welcome home.
Germany Speaks
Germany’s recent withdrawal from the League of Nations 
and the 'World Disarmament conference and their suggestion 
that other nations disarm if Germany must disarm arc all moves 
that should have been anticipated.
It could not have been expected that a nation of Germany’s 
size, natural resources, and intelligent population could indefin­
itely labor under the severe terms of the Treaty of Versailles 
that among its restrictions limited Germany’s standing army to 
200,000; relinquished control of the Kiel Canal and of the 
Rhine; released most of her navy and merchant marine; and 
compelled Germany to destroy all of her fortified works and 
fortifications in all German territory west of a line fifty kilo­
meters cast of the llhine. In effect, it made Germany almost 
totally helpless against invading forces.
These conditions were imposed when the memory of a hun­
gry Empire was vivid. Since that time Germany has changed. 
Her people have rebuilt from the ruins of the devastating war 
the spirit of a new nation now ready to take its place among 
the great powers of the world. The restrictions imposed upon 
her will impede her further progress; so some revision must be 
made.
The League of Nations showed its weakness when it dealt 
with Japan, who defiantly waved a red flag in she League’s 
faec without receiving in return more than a weak protest.
Germany cognizant of the significance of this incident has, 
no fear ol! the League, but has great confidence in the belief 
that eventually their demands will be conceded.
Free Tuition for llie Unemployed Graduate
Once again members of the Executive Board ol! Carnegie 
have demonstrated that the welfare ol' graduates is not beyond1 
their province, The Board, by recent action, has repeated the 
offer, first made last February, ol' free tuition in under-graduate 
subjects to unemployed graduates who have secured their 
Bachelor Degree here.
Those eligible under terms ol' the offer may schedule any 
under-graduate subjects for which they have completed the 
requisite training, Tho only restriction made by the Board is 
that subjects cannot be scheduled which would necessitate the 
formation ol' additional classes. Payment ol' laboratory charges 
•covering the cost ol' materials is also required.
Those qualifying under the plan are graded on the samo 
basis as other students and work completed satisfactorily will 1)0 fully accredited,
Throughout I,lie depression period, the Hoard lias pursued 
a very liberal policy with respect to payment of foes and this 
latest action is evidence of a sine,ore desire to help the man or 
woman who wants an education.
If this new aid to graduates helps only to bolster their 
morale during this frying period, then we believe the purpose 
of the Board will have been served.
Unemployed graduates will no doubt welcome I his olTer as 
heartily as was the ease last February.
Buy Tartan Advertised Products
CUKKËNT OPINION
In glancing through the pages of our paper we sometimes 
forget that the advertisements appearing in each issue go a long 
way in defraying the expense of publishing the paper. The 
merchants who display their wares advertise for financial re­
turn not for charity. When returns are good more advertise­
ments appear.
Buy products advertised in the Tartan and mention that 
you saw the advertisement in your college paper.
DEAR EDITOR
Editor's Note—The commons as 
a unit of Carnegie, an educational 
institution, is exempt from the N. 
R. A. code.
Editor, The Tartan:
We thoroughly believe that, the 
author of the article in the Octo­
ber 10 issue concerning; the com­
mons has overlooked a very im­
portant issue. The commons has 
not joined the N. R. A.
We ol’ the student body aro not 
asking For something that is a way 
out ol’ the question, something that 
would cause them to discontinue 
businoss, but. wo want a fair deal.
Many private homos and several 
fraternity houses have signed N. 
It. A. consumer pledgos, in which 
ovory person in tho house Is 
pledged to buy solely from mom 
bora of tho National Recovery Ad­
ministration. Because of faculty 
members and students schedules it 
is entirely impossible, as well as 
extremely absurd, to think of out­
ing the noon day meal off cam­
pus. Now it. Is utterly impossible, 
as well as Inconvenient, for many 
to bring their lunch to school and 
as tho result of such conditions, 
people are absolutely forced to 
break their vow in order to main­
tain their health, .lust by law­
fully allowing a few Blue Fugles 
to decorate the barren walls of the 
commons many consciences could 
be cleared and N. R. A. signers 
promises fulfilled.
The sandwiches have not come 
down in price or increased in qual­
ity. When one compares the sand­
wich prices of the commons and 
those of such places as Tsaly's, he 
will readily notice the very great 
difference. The quality, variety or
quantity is not there to account 
for a difference in price.
We do not believe it is neces­
sary to mention about the differ­
ence between the commons and 
other eating places concerning dec­
orations, table linens, expensive 
fixtures, business outlook and over­
head, as these seem to be verjr 
obvious.
What we wish to know is, “Does 
the Common’s Administration in­
tend to change in their prices and 
quality of food?” H. B.
YESTERDAY 18 DEAD
You young fellow» JuHt out of 
school: you have had a tough 
time the last two years, you were 
anxloua to get to work. Nothing 
opened up. You felt you were 
butting your heads against a stone 
wall.
We pass on to you a phrase wo 
saw tho other day—to you and to 
the others who joined your ranks 
this spring.
That phrase la, yesterday is 
dead!
The country lias been bogged 
down before. It is going tp begin 
to pull out shortly, just as it al­
ways has pulled out. But mark 
this, business is not coming back 
just as it was before. It never 
doos, after going through tho 
wringer,
A lot of old leaders and old 
methods have passed out. A new 
bunch of aggressive and resource­
ful young fellows will come stomp­
ing up to grasp new opportunities.
For yesterday is dead!
Now opportunities, mind you. 
Not the opportunities of the last 
decade, those are gone. If experi­
ence is a guide, recovery will not 
come in orderly fashion, along the 
old lines. Keen men will see busi­
ness chances here and there even 
while tilings are at a low level. 
Chances that grow out of the de­
pression with its changed de­
mands.
Perhaps these will lie in new 
products of science, in inexpensive 
novelties, in house cooling, in
cheap farm lands. Men who live 
in the past will think of things as 
they were in 1929, So they will
fall to see the new conditions and
take advantage of them.
But the alert young crowd will 
Jump at the new chances, develop 
them, build up with them as busi­
ness builds up.
Yesterday is dead!
Have you heard of the ilu-flu 
bird that flies backard? It wants 
to see where it has been. It 
doesn’t give a darn where it is go­
ing. Don't be a ilu-flu bird.
You youngsters, seize any decent 
job. Be ready for new conditions, 
new ideas that offer. But keep 
your eyes open. Your humble job 
may have possibilities that the old 
order did not reveal.
Remember, yesterday is dead!
—Kansas City Star.
THE PURPOSE OF AN 
EDUCATION
Only 15 per cent ol' the 1,500,000 
young men and women graduated 
by American colleges in 1933 have 
jobs, according to Colonel Ii. Ed­
mond Bullis, executive officer of 
the National Committee for Mental 
Hygiene, in a New York interview 
In which lie expresses concern lest 
this army of youth bo disillusioned.
Tho plight of these graduates is 
grave enough, but it is doubtful if 
they will succumb to disillusion­
ment If they view the purpose of a 
college oducation in tho right light.
During tho Boom Era, colleges 
wore imbued with the same get- 
rich, spend-quick spirit that car­
ried the nation to disaster. College 
youth boliovod for the time being 
that t.lio main purpose of a higher 
education was to learn how to 
make money faster. That never 
has boon and never will bo tho pur­
pose of an oducation.
It. is true, of course, that educa­
tion, training, will help In business 
as In other pursuits, but thoro is 
vastly more to oducation than 
moroly material benefits, Tho cul­
tured man Is he who has acquired 
I ho art of making the best, of life 
In whatever circumstancos ho may 
placed. A college oducation 
should endow Its possessor with an 
appreciation of the cultural treas­
ures of the past and with some 
understanding and discernment, of 
lltc future. It Is Just an appetizer 
for life Itself, arousing an Interest 
In tho pursuit of knowledge which 
every man should continue after 
his formal education ends. No 
student of sensitive intelligence 
an acquire an education without 
establishing the foundations of a 
personal philosophy which will 
help him to maintain his balance 
through just such periods of ad­
versity as that which has afficted 
this country since 1929,
If students go to college just to 
learn how to make money fast, 
then there is danger in the fact 
that there are so many jobless 
graduates. But we believe they 
have a broader outlook than that.—

German Genius Comes to America
By Thomas S. Baker, President
By THOMAS BAKER 
The following article, written by 
President Baker, appeared in a re­
cent issue of the Carnegie Maga­
zine.—The Editor.
The University of Wisconsin 
will begin this fall a novpl experi­
ment in education provided' it can 
find ten prodigies of learning.
Through a tutorial method, the 
university expects to train a few 
extraordinarily brilliant students 
for intelligent public leadership. 
The name of the new course is 
“classical humanities,’’ and it will 
comprise an exhaustive four-year 
study of Greek and Roman civili­
zation. In addition to being pre­
cocious intellectual giants, prodi­
gies eligible for the course must 
have had four years of Latin in 
high school.
Viewed realistically, this effort 
to educate students for politics is 
one of the most, nonsensical over 
projected by pedagogs. Just how 
a four-year study of Greek and 
ltoman civilization will fit the 
prodigies for leadership in the 
maelstrom of American govern­
ment will be beyond the ken of 
most people, even the most vision­
ary.
The Wisconsin professors have 
made the mistake of confusing the 
means, and a comparatively in­
significant. means, for the end. A 
knowledge of Greek and Roman civ­
ilization offers a good background 
for an attack on present-day prob- 
les. but to subject a group of 
prodigies to four years of study of 
classical history is silly. They 
could learn all they need from 
Greece and Rome in a few weeks' 
study, and for practical purposes 
I this would not. include learning 
those two difficult ancient lan-
It will be a safe bet that in four 
years the American peonle will 
1 not look to the ten Wisconsin 
1 trained prodigies to lead them out 
of ¦whatever morasses they may be 
in.—The Oklahoma Daily.
An eminent German scientist 
said to me this summer: “Ger­
man science, one of the most price­
less of our national treasures, has 
lost much of its glory.through the 
ruthless interference of the gov­
ernment. It is as though a child 
had smashed a beautiful mirror 
and did not know what to do with 
the pieces.” Last January and 
February, while lecturing in Ger­
many, 1 visited a number of Ger­
man universities and I was amazed 
at the quality and quantity of the 
scientific work that was being 
done. Political clouds were gather­
ing on the horizon but I was as­
sured that little had happened to 
hamper the studies of the univer­
sity men. They were anxious about 
the future, but they were proud of 
the past and content with the pres­
ent. Since then, the clouds have 
brought a storm which has wrought 
havoc in many of the institutions 
devoted to research and to educa­
tion.
Last February in Munich I was 
invited by a distinguished chemist 
to visit his new laboratory which 
had just been built with funds 
furnished by the Rockefeller Foun­
dation. The professor was deeply 
touched by the liberality and 
thoughtfulness of Ills American 
benefactors. I knew him to be a 
man of great distinction as a scien­
tist. I soon discovered him to bo 
a man of great porsonal charm and 
with very inspiring qualities as a 
teacher. 'Three months later, when 
I road of the upheaval in the Ger­
man unlversltlos, I feared that my 
Munich acquaintance (of Polish or­
igin) might be forced to resign. 1 
went therefore to tho officers of 
the Rockefeller Foundation in New 
York and fold them that we would 
ho happy to offer the Munich pro­
fessor a position at the Carnogio 
Institute of Technology should lio 
decide to- loavo Germany, Thus be­
gan a series of conferences and 
an exchange of letters which final­
ly made It desirable that 1 make 
a hurried trip to Europe. The con­
ferences woro continued in t.lio 
Paris offices of the Rockefeller 
Foundation. There I was told that 
after months of uncertainty my 
Munich friend hud been permitted 
to retain, at least temporarily, his 
post, but that there were many 
other scientists of equal or even 
greater attainments who would 
welcome an opportunity to em­
igrate. Some had been “sent on 
leave,” a term which made their 
future very uncertain; some were 
unhappy in the new political at­
mosphere and felt that their work 
must suffer. As my discussions 
had been concerned with a chem­
ist up to that time, my first in­
quiry was, “Who is the best avail­
able chemist?’' The reply was, 
“Berl of Darmstadt. He is not 
only the best available chemist but 
the best technical chemist in Ger­
many, and possibly the best in 
Europe.” I told my informants that 
I knew Professor Berl; that he 
had visited me in Pittsburgh and 
I bad visited him in Darmstadt; 
that he had contributed to our 
Coal Conferences, and was inter­
ested in just those phases of chem­
istry in which we Pittsburghers 
are interested; but that it seemed 
inconceivable to me that Germany 
would part with a scientist whose 
contributions to pure chemistry 
and to German industry had been 
so valuable. There was nothing 
for me to do but to decide imme­
diately to go to Darmstadt.
I then asked who was the best 
available physicist and I was told 
“Unquestionably, Stern of Ham­
burg. But,” it was added, “you 
can hardly secure him because ho 
is considering a call to Oxford.” 
However, 1 set out for Germany 
with rooommond''Hons other than 
those of Berl and Stern.
In Paris 1 had learned from my 
advisors at. the Rockofellor Foun­
dation that the exodus of German 
scientific men had already begun. 
England had probably secured the 
greatest number—Oxford. Cam­
bridge, the University of London, 
Manchester and other provincial 
universities. The Belgian univer­
sities had invited several. The 
Dutch, South American. Russian 
and Scandinavian universities were 
eager to strengthen their faculties 
from this source. My first talk 
with Berl in Frankfurt brought 
forth the statement, “I should like 
to think it over.
In Ber’in I met at dinner a small 
group of the directors of the great 
1 research institutes for chemistry
and'physics (all "Aryans,” to use 
the current phraseology). They 
were as warm in their praise of 
Berl and Stern as my advisors in 
Paris had been. I should add that 
Dr. Abraliam Flexner, the head of 
the new Institute for Advanced 
Study, now located at Princeton, 
had given me a letter of introduc­
tion to the editor of the leading 
German scientific publication, 
whom I consulted daily and whose 
advice I found invaluable and who 
encouraged me to do my best to 
secure for Pittsburgh the men 
whose engagement has just been 
announced.
I shall not go into the details 
of the negotiations. I saw many 
men, any one of whom I realized 
would be a valuable addition to 
our faculty. A chance meeting with 
Professor Stern in Berlin made me 
believe all the handsome things 
that had been said about him. A 
visit to his Physical Institute in 
Hamburg, also partly equipped by 
the Rockefeller Foundation, in­
creased my eagerness to invite him 
to Carnegie. But I left Hamburg 
with very little hope of making 
Pittsburgh more attractive than 
Oxford.
In Heidelberg I had a second 
conference with Professor Berl and 
an arrangement was concluded sat­
isfactory to both of us. I then re­
turned to Paris and spent several 
days anxiously trying to decide 
whether my invitation to the 
physics post should go to a 
younger and less famous man or 
whether I should wait until I re­
turned to America for Stern’s final 
answer. Two days before my sail­
ing date, however, I was surprised 
and delighted to receive a tele­
gram from Stern asking for an ap­
pointment in Paris for the next 
day. At; this meeting he told me 
he was prepared to consider favor­
ably my proposal. He had spent 
one semester In America at the 
University of> California, from 
which Institution he had received 
an honorary degree. 1-Ie had a num­
ber of friends among American 
physicists whom he admired and 
ho thought he could do good work 
bore, but he would like permission 
to bring with him his assistant, Dr. 
Estermann, who had been with him 
10 years and whose name was as­
sociated with some of his import­
ant discoveries. He said further 
that Dr. Estermann bad been in the 
United States for a year and a 
half, having held a Rockefeller na­
tional research fellowship, and he 
would be invaluable in helping him 
to set up his new experimental lab­
oratory. Dr. Estermann had ac­
cepted tentatively an offer to go 
to the University of Cambridge, but 
had consented to join Professor 
Stern if I could make it possible. 
To this request I was unable to 
give an immediate reply. On my 
return to Pittsburgh and after 
many consultations with a number 
of gentlemen whose opinion I val­
ued. the matter was settled at the 
beginning of August by an ex­
change of cablegrams and Pro­
fessor Berl, chemist; -Professor 
Stern, experimental physicist, and 
his assistant, Dr. Estermann, will 
join our faculty at the beginning 
of the academic year 1933-34.
There is not the space to give 
the biographies of our new pro­
fessors. From what has been said 
it may be inferred that Professor 
Berl, who is the older-, has prac­
tical interests as well as scientific 
interests. He is a man of the 
world, adaptable, courteous, and 
with a most engaging personality. 
Professor Stern is the pure scien­
tist—a great experimentalist, pos­
sibly the greatest experimentalist 
in the field of physics. His name 
has frequently been mentioned in 
connection with the Noble Prize. 
While his interests center largely 
in his laboratory, ho is a com­
panionable man with wide intel­
lectual interests. His name is often 
associated with our great Ameri­
can physicists—Langmuir, Comp­
ton, Milllkan.
Engineering must have a back­
ground of pure science, if It is to 
advance. The engineer is the 
liaison olllcer between the scien­
tist’s laboratory and the industrial 
plant. Therefore, in enlarging the 
purely scientific resoyrc.es of our in­
stitution, we are quickening the 
work of our engineering faculty and 
its students. . . .
It is most fortunate that our new 
I professors in coming to us do not.
displace any of our present st 
| which has remained intact through 
the period of depression; and it is 
my hope that funds may be .se­
cured for the maintenance of the 
new laboratories from sources out­
side the Institute.
Home coming . . . the return of the gray- 
beards in all their hoary glory . . . the time to 
which every loyal giad looks forward ... to be 
with the old gang once again ... in spirit if 
not in person ... we asked the pater what hap­
pens at Homecoming ... he doesn’t remember 
... he did mention a few of the things that 
would happen if we didn’t come home . .. . all 
kidding aside though, it does look like a big 
week-end is cornin’ up.
To start it all we have our first formal of the 
year . . . the Carnegie Guild Charity Ball in 
Thistle Hall on Friday . . . it’s a pretty safe bet 
that everyone has a charitable streak . . . here’s 
a novel chance to wreck two robins with one 
rock . . . or is it a rock and a quarter? . . . 
we’re afraid to look at the tux . . . it’s been a 
great summer for moths and other carnivorous 
animals . . . incidentally, it took the Guild to 
discover what vice presidents are used for . . . 
the class v. p.’s were rounded up and placed in 
charge of the ticket dep’t . . . that’s putting the 
second best talker in each class to work.
The game on Saturday . . . but more of that 
later . . . sufficient to say that Notre Dame has 
replaced Pitt for the first time in many years • 
as the Homecoming attraction . . . the alumni 
have outlined a big program for themselves as 
usual . . . it all ends up with a victory celebra­
tion (we hope) dinner dance at the Hotel Schen- 
ley . . . most of the fraternities have big doin’s 
on .. . . personally, we always like to study 
after the Notre Dame game . . . months after. *****
We will ever be grateful to the fate that guid­
ed our destinies to Forbes Field on one bleak 
November afternoon in 1926. We mean the aft­
ernoon when Carnegie astounded the football 
world by smashing a potential national cham­
pionship Notre Dame team 19-0. Followers of 
the Irish will probably never forget that immor­
tal contest—followers of Carnegie certainly never 
will.
After the game a Tartan rooter sent us the 
following clipping from a Cleveland paper. The 
article itself has little literary or entertaining 
value but it is priceless as an indication of the 
position then of Carnegie as viewed by an im­
partial nation. The school team then was just 
as it is now1—same kind of students, band, team, 
spirit, everything—which makes some parts of 
the clipping seem rather amusing.
It is interesting to know what the rest of the 
world thinks about you when you suddenly spring 
into prominence. Here’s what it thought about 
that little school called Carnegie Tech. The story 
was headed:
“CARNEGIE USED NO KID GLOVES IN TILT”
“Boys, take it from yours very sincerely, those 
neighbors across the line in Pennsylvania play a 
mean game of football. Last Saturday we heard 
the repeated impact of bone cracking bone as 
Carnegie Tech’s big red-sweatered mountaineers 
smeared Notre Dame in a game that wras THE 
upset of the year because of its crushing and 
undeniable one-sidedness.
“All year we have watched Big Ten football 
games. Thought Benny Friedman, Moon Backer, 
Marty Kai’ow, Ed Hess and Benny Oosterbaan 
were just about the nuts as far as this particular 
section of the football world is concerned. But 
buried over there in the Allegheny Mountains, 
lacking a good press agent, minus all the frill 
and frumperies of the Conference, minus — and 
perhaps it is a good thing—a duly appreciative 
audience of idolizers, there are football teams— 
big, rangy, gawky, hard-boiled fellows who make 
Tarzan of the Apes look like Little Lord Fauntle- 
roy.
“How come Carnegie ran up such a score on 
Notre Dame?
"Several thousand inquisitive football souls are 
asking that question today as the hysteria of the 
Army-Navy game passes and eyes shift around to 
contemplate the catastrope that struck the na­
tional contenders.
“We'll tell you why we think Carngeie won. 
Those barrel-cliested boys with hands as big as 
bams simply administered an old-fashioned beat­
ing to the light Notre Dame outfit. They used 
superior weight and a football knowledge that 
was inspired to a frenzy of desperation, to sweep 
the astounded and cocky band of Irishmen com­
pletely off their feet.
“They play rough, tough football over in them 
thar’ mountains. None of this sissifled patting 
of backs, gallant raising-of-fallen-foes-to-the-feet 
junk at. all. Maybe it's the atmosphere of the 
rugged Alleghenys. Maybe it’s the influence of 
the tough and wiry steel workers. Maybe it’s a 
general environment that turns up its nose at 
anything that savors of the cheerio spirit that is 
softening the Big Ten.
“At the end'of the final whistle in Forbes Field 
each of Notre Dame’s 40 horsemen was broken 
in spirit. Anyone would feel lcinda sick in the 
stomach beaten by 19 points. But that was not 
all. Each of those 40 horsemen walked off the 
field holding his head, licking a pair of split lips 
or nursing a wrenched foot. They were battered 
and smashed from goal line to goal line.
“Understand, there was nothing dirty about
that Pennsylvania football. They just surprised 
the living daylights out of the Irish by the fury 
of their play. Notre Dame was used to the 
nicey-nice foes of the type we see on the more 
prominent gridirons.
“Pennsylvania football knows no quarter. They 
ignore the huddle. Their cheers are amateurish. 
Their bands parade in sloppy formation. (Nice 
guy.) They have no pageantry, no cake-eating 
talad dressing for their games. They nearly kill 
each other off when they play—that’s all.
“Psychology played a big part in beating the 
Irish. To them it was just another football game. 
Even when they were two touchdowns behind in 
the second quarter they acted as if they could 
get them back whenever they wanted to. It was 
amusing the way the first team entered the game. 
The Notre Dame shock troops had held Carnegie 
0-0 for the first quarter. Then the first team 
stood up. Very theatrically they tossed off their 
sweaters. They pranced around, laughed and 
kidded one another, as if to say, ‘Well, here’s the 
first team—now you’ll see some REAL football.’ 
They dashed out on to the field and, oh, how they 
were smacked. Those big mountaineers were 
worked up to a high emotional pitch. They were 
desperate. They dug their toes in, gritted their 
teeth and wham, wham, wham — over went two 
touchdowns in about four minutes.”
That was Cleveland’s somewhat melodramatic 
impression of Carnegie. Other localities doubt­
lessly had equally vivid ideas. Nevertheless, that 
was the game which placed the name of Car-j 
negie Tech in flaming letters in nearly every! 
newspaper in the country. That was the game 
which lifted the Plaid out of obscurity and placed 
it among the leaders. That was the game that'g 
made Harpster and it was also Harpster that || 
helped make that game.
The same sort of thing that enabled Carnegie n 
to beat Temple—and that empowered Xavier to [I 
hold us last week—is the reason’ Carnegie beat {if 
Notre Dame in 1926. If we see that intangible 
“thing” against the Irish this year, there’ll be no 
school on Monday. You know what it is 
fight.*****
Mr. Davis got his brand new ¿rid-grapli out of| 
the tissue paper last Saturday and turned it overE 
to bis gang to practice on during the Xavier | 
“warm-up” affair. The board proved surprisingly | 
simple to operate and-very easy to follow. Line« 
trouble developed which delayed the game some-1 
what and frequent “time-outs” resulted. Ordin- 
arily the game operates from the board with no I 
delay. One other improvement which seems nec- C 
essary is a system of announcing the side-lights S 
of the game, scores of other contests and other $ 
bits of news as a sort of “heart interest.”
The success of the grid-grapli depends upon the 1 
whole-hearted backing of the student body. The 
board was purchased by the “Y” at considerable | 
expense, solely as an aid to us students in back- |j 
ing our team. The small admission fee doesn’t! 
begin to defray operating expenses.
This is one party where “the more the merrier” 
axiom holds true. In ’28 we saw the gym packed I 
with students watching the grid-grapli and the 
excitement was almost as great as if the games 
were really being played in view. The band and I 
the cheerleaders were there and the crowd had a | 
loud time. We’ll be lookin’ for you up at your | 
grid-grapli during the Purdue game.
We didn’t leave much for the sports dep’t to | 
write about but let it pass because we’re getting | 
warmed up for the Pitt game.
A truly great day in our otherwise uninterest­
ing social career was last Saturday night! ... 
Never thought we’d live to see the Dragons give 
anything away . . . But there it was ... all 
you had to do was pop the right balloon and get 
a box of candy . . . free . . . Our cup of joy 
wasn’t quite filled, though ... At the last min­
ute the committee weakened and only gave out 
four boxes instead of five . . . They said nobody 
came for the extra box ... So we went for it 
... No luck . . . Our souvenir was. elastic in­
stead of edible.
Those who survived the rush seemed to like 
the n6w idea . . . But why did the bandleader 
change his costume in the middle of the dance 
. . . from Weitz to black? . . . maybe someone 
hit. him with a ripe balloon.
The old faces are slowly drifting back to This-

ter acquainted . . . The Forbes Hall delegation

ON SECOND THOUGHT
By Will Landsberg
This is an era of square deals. 
The forgotten man has come in for 
his share—the underdog has awak­
ened to the dawn of his day. NRA 
has injected the spirit into the 
air and this column has imbibed 
enough of it to make it suddenly 
ambitious. Not that it has any­
thing to do with NRA other than 
recognizing in it a kindred spirit, 
for it, too, proposes a square deal 
—one of a different nature, how­
ever. There prevails among the 
students here an attitude- of indif­
ference, a lack of inquisitiveness 
concerning things which do not 
pertain directly to themselves or 
to their work. At Carnegie a stu­
dent is so occupied with his work 
that in his spare time, too, one 
generally finds him preoccupied 
with it. It becomes his sole, all- 
absorbing interest, to the exclu­
sion of all else. Therefor he is 
conscious of world events In the 
same way that one is conscious of 
incidental scenery in a play where 
attention Is focused on the lead­
ing character. I think world 
events deserve a better fate than 
that. I’d like to help give them a 
square deal.
Whenever 1 enter the Commons 
or any other place where students 
congregate in large groups, I am 
usually conscious of an appalling 
lack of heated discussion. Per­
haps, in all fairness, I should 
modify that last statement. I have 
seen the painters scrap over their 
Picassos and Matisses. Architects 
have their Louis Sullivans, Frank 
Lloyd Wrights and Le Corbusiers 
to wage wars over. Debussy 
Stravinsky and Erik Satie are 
I cause for plenty of dissentlon with 
the music students. But if I were 
to approach a group of engineers 
involved in a quiet.- orderly dis­
cussion of thermodynamics or 
electro-magnetics and were to say
TWO TECH MEN
to them, “Russia’s been struggling 
for fifteen years and now they’re 
beginning to come out of the rut. 
Do you think they’ll succeed?”
Or “Germany bases her chances 
for recovery on a fantastic theory 
of race purity, backed by curtail­
ment of liberty and strict dictator­
ship. Are they right?”
Or “A blue eagle has pronounced 
the doom of capitalism in Amer­
ica,” I think the most inspired 
answer I should get would be the 
inevitable “What’s that got to do 
with me.” To my mind that’s, ap­
palling.
Perhaps I exaggerate. I hope I 
do. But notwithstanding a slight 
exaggeration, I believe I’ve almost 
nicked the bull’s eye. Heated dis­
cussion has a definite place in a 
collegiate' atmosphere, I think a 
college environment is incomplete 
without it. It’s certainly a refresh­
ing stimulus to thought and also 
because a change of mind is always 
recreational, it can be a lot of fun. 
Then, is this know-little-care-less at­
titude the reason for itself? Does 
one care little because one knows 
little would one care more if one 
knew more. I think so.
It’s quite evident that the stu­
dents here see very little of the 
newspapers, or they choose to 
ignore the front page. Yet almost 
everyone reads the Tartan quite 
thoroughly if for simply no other 
reason than that it gives him some­
thing to do while eating his Tues­
day’s lunch. This then is the 
waited-for opportunity, and I catch 
its first knock.- I make use of this 
opportunity by presenting my 
noint of v'ew, not because it is the 
best point of view, but simply be­
cause it is the only one I know and 
very likely just as good as the 
next. It is something tangible to 
compare with your own and per­
haps you may find interest in the 
comparison. The success of this 
column depends entirely upon 
whether you accept or reject, a^ree 
with or challenge it. Do either 
and its success is assured.. * Do 
neither and it’s time to fold up 
the old portable typewriter.

Football, basketball, tennis, 
Rifle-range,, action in Gym, 
Swimming, theater and dances, 
With Co-eds waiting for ‘Him.'
So activities balance the worldn?| 
life
Of these men of C. I. T.
And the Kilties lead in action 
The men of R. O. T. C.
Then sing a song of Tech’ Men 
And cheer them three times three- 
Wish them ‘good luck’ on the higk 
road
To win a Carnegie degree.
