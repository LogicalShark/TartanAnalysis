from the Science School, was elected 
VO president of the Carnegie Tech 
Student Council by the members of 
the present council.

PLAID LOSES TO STATE 
IN LAST TWO INNINGS
The Carnegie Tech baseball team 
was defeated, Saturday, by the Penn 
State Team, S to 6, in a loosely 
played game, errors being frequent. 
Howard, of Penn State, looked as if 
he would shut the Plaid out until the 
seventh inning, when six runs clat­
tered across the plate.
The Center county team scored a 
run in the first inning on a triple, 
a hit batsman, a walk, and another 
hit batsman, so these two runs were 
the fault of Darlington.
In the seventh inning Tech woke 
up and with two down slammed the 
ball for six runs. Errors on Penn 
State’s part helped along consider­
ably. In fact two fielders and the 
short-stop of the State school stopped 
to let a high fiy fall among them. 
“Reindeer” Gretzler slammed the ball

OPPORTUNITY FOR BAND 
MUSICIANS IN U. S. NAVY
The following offer was received 
from Lieutenant Commander Mans­
field, U. S. N., and may be of in­
terest to some of the musicians in 
school:
“We have this day received orders 
to use every effort to enlist for the 
Naval Coast Defence Reserve Fleet, 
musicians for bands, to be stationed 
at one or more of the Naval Sta­
tions or Reserve Ships of this Fleet.
“It would be highly gratifying to 
us if you could help by informing 
those of musical ability, who would 
desire service in the Patrol Fleet 
in this capacity.
“I understand, that one of these 
bands will be stationed at Cape 
May, one at the Philadelphia Naval 
Station and one at Lewes, which is 
on the southern shore of the en­
trance to Delaware Bay.”
AU REVOIR DANCE TO 
BE HELD IN THE UNION
According to those supervising the 
affair, there will be big doings in 
Carnegie Union, Friday, May 25, 
when the 1917 Au Revoir Dance will 
be held. Since only one hundred 
couples will be admtited, it behooves 
all those that want to get in on the 
big doings to get their tickets early. 
A special feature of the dance will 
by the music furnished by the ex­
cellent McLoud six-piece colored or­
chestra.

PENN STATE WINS
Penn State with 96 points and 
Harrisburg Technical High with 
691 points, won the annual Pitt 
Intercollegiate and Track meet held 
' on Schenley Oval last Saturday. 
Pitt took second with 83 points and 
Carnegie Tech third with 38 points 
in the college events. The other 
entry, West Virginia University, ob­
tained five points.
The Penn State team was nearly 
as large as the Tech and Pitt teams 
combined and they had a regular 
flock of entries in every event.
Lawson, of Tech, took second in 
the two-mile in a gruelling finish. 
He took the lead in the last lap 
by a remarkable spurt but 30 yards 
from, the tape, Weigle, of Pitt, who 
was slightly fresher passed the fast

The administrative faculty council, in view of the present mil­
itary activity of the country, has suggested that it would be ap­
propriate to include among the Class day exercises of this year a 
review of the Tech battalions and perhaps a presentation ol! colors. 
Of course, this is a matter for the students to decide, but it seems 
to be a valuable suggestion.

NOTICE!
TO IN WHO HAVE ENLISTED OR WHO EXPECT TO ENLIST
The Tartan is the only publication that can give you I lie 
up-to-date news from Tech. Did it ever occur to yon how 
nice it would seem to receive The Tartan and read what Tech 
is doing next year when you are in camp here or on tlio 
firing line in Europe?
It is the wish of The Tartan staff that all Tech men lie 
kept in touch with the school. Therefore we are making this 
offer.
IF YOU ENLIST THE STAFF WILL SEND YOU THE 
TARTAN .EACH WEEK TO ANY PART OF THE WORLD 
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE DOLLAR.
This offer will hold only until June 9, 1917, and is good 
only for enlisted men.

STUDENT OFFICERS COMMISSIONED AND ASSIGNED DUTY IN REGIMENT
FORMER TECH STUDENT WRITES FROM FRANCE
“Somewhere in France,” where the 
bursting shells leave their wake of 
death and destruction, not a few 
Americans are entailed fighting under 
the ilag of France. One of them, a 
former Tech man, takes time to write 
to his friends.
My Dear McCorkle:
Many thanks for your letter of Feb­
ruary 27th. which duly arrived. It is 
good to find that America, even at this 
late date, has joined in the fray against 
the Hun. She will be1 of inestimable 
value in patroling the Atlantic and in 
sending supplies and munitions across 
to the scenes of war. In addition, it 
will mean the holding of German ag- 
gressiveism, methods and trade after 
the war, and her influence 011 South 
America will also bo oC groat value. 
So, although her fighting men may 
never get right into touch in any 
large numbers with the common en­
emy, yet her entry is a thing of utmost 
importance. «
The Allies’ successes have given us 
increased hope that the end may ere 
long be in view, and we anxiously 
await further developments. I sup­
pose spy hunting is quite an interest­
ing occupation for the professional 
and ameteur detectives now in the 
States. I notice that Pittsburgh was 
one of the first cities to have trouble.

ANNUAL SPRING DANCE 
HELD AT DORMITORY
Chaplain GeQ. E. T. Stevenson of 
the U. S. Navy, will be in Pitts­
burgh, Thursday evening, May 24, 
and will give an illustrated lecture, 
in Soldiers Memorial Hall, on

DR. RAINSFORD SPEAKS 
AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY
The annual spring dance last Fri­
day, marked the closing of the sea­
son's festivities at the dormitory.
Decorations were fittingly carried 
out in red, white and blue and for 
those sentimental ones who like to 
“sit out” dances, the Chinese lan 
terns on the porch offered pleasing 
substitutes for the moon.
Owing to the fact that L. many 
men have enlisted the number pres­
ent was very much smaller than in 
times past. Bowen, however, with 
his tuneful syncopations, did much 
to assuage the feeling of regret for 
those not present.
Dr. Rainsford, former rector of St. 
George’s Episcopal church, New 
York, was the principal speaker at 
the general assembly last Wednes­
day in Carnegie Music Hall. Dr. 
Rainsford’s theme was Christ’s gos­
pel of brotherly love and his words 
applied chiefly to the present war. 
The address was forcefully delivered 
and made a deeif impression on the 
audience.
Preceding the meeting the Car­
negie Tech Student Regiment was 
reviewed by Director I-Iamerschlag 
and Dr.' Rainsford, who expressed 
his appreciation of the spectacle, in 
the course of his address, praised 
the students for their excellent spirit 
and patriotism. The students 
marched to the Music Hall, and, 
led by the unsurpassable band, gave 
a good account of themselves.
Another speaker on the program 
was former Congressman James 
Francis Burke, who deplored the ne­
cessity of Secretary McAdoo’s tour­
ing the country to teach the people 
their duty in regard to the Liberty 
Loan and the feeding of our allies 
in Europe.
In the course of the meeting Dr. 
Bingham of the Department of Psy- 
I ohology, read a telegram from P. P. 
{Claxton, Commissioner of Education 
at Washington, in which the com- 
I missioner advised technical students 
I to continue their studies rather 
(Continued on Page Four.)
The students of illustration have 
also been working on posters for 
“Robin Hood,” which will lie given, 
by the Mendelssohn Choir, assisted 
by somo Tech students, under the 
direction of Bertram Weber in 
Groonsburg. Posters will bo dis­
tributed throughout Allegheny and 
Westmoreland counties. Many prizes 
wore given to the students for their 
original designs. David Mason won 
first prize of $10; Mildrod Floyd $5; 
Miriam Smith, $-1; George Green, 
Edna Fordo and Joseph Punzak each 
won $3; Harriot Hyde, H. D. Kolper, 
Alice Craig, Jeannette Shirk and 
Marie Wilson were oacli given $2; 
while several one dollar prizes were 
given.
TECH SCRUBS LOSE TO 
EAST LIBERTY ACADEMY
The Scrubs lost to East Liberty
Academy on Tech Field, although a 
good game was played. Gretzler, the 
Tech loft fielder, made two throe-base 
hits, but received credit for only one 
on account to cutting second base. 
Landoll also made a three-bagger.
Fulmer made the only throe-base lilt 
for vE. L. A. during the game. Few 
errors were made in the game, Tech 
making four costly ones, and E. L. A. 
making two.
Sonntag batted for Baker In the 
ninth; Haller batted for Fulmer in the 
eighth and ninth.
The score by innings:
Tech .................0 0 0 2 1 2 0 1 1—7

LOOSE PLAYING SPELLS DISASTER FOR TECH
Last Thursday was tlio scene oil a 
slaughter of the Plaid baseball nine 
atlihe hands ol! Grove City to the 
tuno of 11 to 8. McCullough's pro­
teges liavo put iorth a surprising 
brand of baseball for a collogo team 
so far this season, ovon ’though they 
have often boon 011 the short end 
of the score and the Grove City 
contest helped to rid their systoms 
of a lot of bad baseball. Although 
the box scoro shows them hoa.vliy 
outscored and ouLhll; 3 to 2, yet a 
little opportune use of tlio bat and 
bettor basorunnlng would have put 
tlio game on Ice for Tech.
Twenty-four Tech runners reached 
first and nine of them reached third 
yet only throe scored. Three of 
I bom died at the plate and three
wore loft strandod on the third
sack.
Twice with a man on third, the 
batter placed a bunt down the first 
base line and the runner was caught 
at the plate standing up. If the 
runners had taken a good load and 
started with the pitcher’s arm as they 
should have they would have
scored.
When Hedlund raced into third
with Stepanlon on the sack holding 
the ball, he spiked the latter badly 
In the ankle, tearing the flesh o»on 
to the bone, Stepanion was carried 
off the field.

EAST DORM WINS GAME 
BY LAST INNING RALLY
The East Dorm was returned a 
winner in the first game of a series 
of throe to be played between the 
East and West Dorms. By mutual 
agreement, the game was for five 
Innings only. The game was Inter­
esting and full t)f thrills and much 
“kidding.” The battery for the East 
Dorm was Smith and Rowe and for 
the west Fuller, L. Jacobson and 
Gore. The score was 7-6, the East 
winning In the last inning by a bat­
ting rally. .Arrangements are be' 
ing made to have the next game

Davis and Steen Win Singles. 
Davis and Beatty Win 
Doubles
DODGE STATE’S STAR
The best that the Penn State Tennis 
team could get with the Plaid racquet- 
ers was an even break—3 matches 
won and three lost. The Penn 
State team the day before took Pitt 
over, 5 to 2. With Captain “Toots” 
Davis setting the example by defeat­
ing Hils man Clark, his team showed a 
marked improvement ovor the Grove 
City game. In speed and control. Davis, 
who was the first Tech man to win his 
match, was hard pushed In the second 
sot. Throe times he had his match 
won all but one point, only to lose it 
and have to play two games more. Ho 
finally won It, 10 to 8. He had a smash­
ing servo and a good cross court loft. 
Jack Beatty, playing number one, 
drew Dodge, the best State player. 
Jack forced Dodge to play his best,

REMEMBER THE SCHOOL
As is announced on the first page of this issue of The Tartan, 
men leaving school to engage in any kind o£ government service 
liave the opportunity to obtain their school paper during all of next 
year at a greatly reduced rate. The paper will be delivered for 
these men—so far as we are able—to any place in the world for 
the price of one dollar.
Naturally wc are not so foolish as to believe that this offer will 
be any inducement for enlisting, and it is not intended as such. 
It is intended, however, as an aid to those men who are giving up— 
at the very least—several years of tlieir college life. If a student 
should leave school now, should mix with mature men in this more 
than mature struggle, and should come out alive, it is very doubtful 
whether or not lie could summon sufficient courage to again take 
up the pursuit of an education at the point where lie is now leaving 
it. College will have no attractions for him unless some determined 
effort is made to keep him interested in the affairs of student life. 
Wo believe that The Tartan is one means to that end, perhaps in 
our case the only means. For that reason wo are making this spe­
cial offer to the men who enlist. Keep in touch with your school.

THE SCHOOL PRESIDENT
For the first time in its history the student body of the Car­
negie Institute ol’ Technology has one of its own members at its 
head. George W. Todd was last week elocted President of the 
Central Council from among a group of four nominees which in­
cluded Miss Helen Senn, Arleigh It. Williamson, and Paul Kaiser 
in addition to Todd. 11 is election from among such a group was in 
itsoll! mi honor, sinoo every one ol! tlio four nominees has been 
extraordinarily prominent in the affairs ol' Tech for tlio past several 
years. Todd himsolf has been BusinORS Manager ol' the Thistle 
this year. President of tlio Science Junior Class, anti Assistant Base­
ball Mamffipr. All tlireo ol' those positions are wonderfully well 
suited to proparo a man for tlio honor of heading the student body, 
since each furnishes a not inconsiderable store of executive and bus­
iness experience.
As the first president ol' tlio Central Council l'odd has an op-, 
portunity which is seldom afforded a student. He has tlio chance 
to establish traditions, to rectify mistakes, to complete the consoli­
dation of (lie four schools. Any one of these aims is worthy of 
much thought and labor from any mini, but all three of them to­
gether—coming as they do without precedent—will require all the 
ingenuity and forethought that the new president and his fellow 
councilmcn can command.
DRILL OR GYM
The administrative council now requires every male student to 
report either for military drill or gymnasium work. The justice of 
that decree is obvious. It is true that the whole spirit of our mil­
itary exercises lies in the fact that they are voluntary, as the suc­
cess with which they were instituted by the students themselves 
shows. However it is equally true that the men who are not taking 
drill can hardly expect to go on doing nothing while their fellows 
work. The least these others can do is to keep themselves physic­
ally fit in the gymnasium.
Since this rule has been announced it has been brought to our 
attention that some few of the men are still not in attendance at 
either place. Such disobedience, is evidently willful. In the -first 
place the ruling comes from our superiors and for that reason if 
for no other should be obeyed. The man who cannot take orders 
as well as give them is worth little in these days. In the second 
place attendance at drill ought to bo a matter of school spirit and 
of personal pride. Our drill has become just as much a school 
activity as football ever was, in fact more so, since more of the 
students can take part;. The man who can bo so soft as to lie in 
bed while his follows are up and working as he ought to be is 
hardly worthy of tlio name “a Tech man.” Each of you knows 
just which of his classmates is lax and disobedient; why not tax 
him with his lack ol' spirit. Don’t lot. anyone sleep at tlio switch!
Additional List of
Men Serving Nation
The following list of enlisted men is supplementary to the one 
published last week, but even now the total list is by no means 
complete. The names published are only those which have been 
reported to the Registrar’s Office.. The Tartan would appreciate 
it greatly if omissions would be brought to our attention.

RICHARD II. RECEIVED 
WITH HIGHEST PRAISE
Editor’s Note:—This review of the 
Drama Department's play, Richard II., 
should have been published two weeks 
ago, but was twice missed through an 
oversight on the part of the staff. 
However, even at this late date we 
feel that the criticism should be print­
ed, since the play is conceded to be 
one of the best things that the depart­
ment has ever done. The story is val­
uable if for no other reason than that 
it furnishes an effective resume of the 
work of the department.
Freshmen in'English at the University of Montana are required 
to memorize “America” and “The Star Spangled Banner” before 
they will receive credit for their work. Could you pass that test?
Incidentally “The Star Spangled Banner” and not “America” 
is our national anthem. The former rather than the latter should 
be featured at student assemblies.
On Tuesday evening, May 1, in the 
Theater of the School of Applied De­
sign, the Department of Dramatic Art 
made its annual votive offering at the 
shrine ol! the Bard of von, by giving 
a magnlllcont production of that moat 
purely historical of Shakespeare’s 
plays, "King Richard the Second,” 
with Charles Frederick Steen in the 
title role. The magnitude of the un­
dertaking will be understood when 
one realizes that, even with the cuts, 
there are nineteen scenes and more 
than twenty-seven speaking parts, 
which included every male student of 
the department and necessitated the 
doubling arid trebling of parts.
The play forecasts the long series 
of civil. crimes and slaughters of 
which Richard’s reign was in fact the 
seed-uplot and presents one of the 
strongest contrasts to be found in dra­
matic literature, namely, Richard, “a 
hollow tri-fler while Fortune smiles 
and a wordy whimperer when she 
frowns”—and Bollingbroke, with “his 
firm-set and tranquil potency of will” 
really “the moving and controlling 
spirit of the drama,” according to' 
Hudson.
Mr. Stein’s art has never expressed 
itself so perfectly as in “Richard, that 
sweet and lovely rose”; he i^ so emi­
nently fitted by nature for the part, 
having the type of features and the 
plaintive quality of voice with which 
one’s imagination endows the king, 
while lie enters so fully into the char­
acteristic dramatic moods which con­
tinually swayed this dllletante mon­
arch. His art rose to greatest height 
in Act III, scenes II and III—notably 
his reading ot the lines beginning, 
“Let’s talk of graves, of worms and 
epitaphs . . . and tell sad stories 
of the death of kings”—also the lines 
beginning, “What must the King do 
now?” It is not too much to say that 
ho invested tlio characterization with 
a peculiar charm and distinction not 
likely to be surpassed by any actor 
who may essay tliè rolo. Just a false 
note here or there and the character 
is vulgarized—but. Steen eliminates all 
the dross and brings out all the pathos 
of the “unhinged Richard,” until, in 
the deposition scene, one shrives him 
of all his sins with one’s tears.lt was 
a wonderful piece of acting from be­
ginning to end, lifting Mr. Steen’s 
work into the real of pure art and is 
a most fitting farewell to his Alma 
Mater, which is to honor him in June

with its B. A. degree in Dramatic Art.
Mr. John Burke was exceedingly 
well cast as “Bollingbroke,” and played 
a very strong role as the efficient man 
of action who holds his vaulting ambi­
tion so well in rein and mounts so 
surely and serenely to Richard’s 
throne. He gave the character that 
“happy mixture of affability and re­
serve which makes its way most sure­
ly to the seat of popular confidence 
and respect.”
Mr. Norwood J. Engle deserves spe­
cial mention for his interpretation of 
“John of Gaunt,” particularly his read­
ing of the lines, “Methinks I am a 
prophet new-inspired.”
Mr. Arleigh Williamson's “Edmond, 
Duke of York,” was a creditable piece 
of work, his diction being noticably 
good, and his make-up appropriate to 
the character; he was fortunately cast 
on this occasion.
Mr. Howard Smith gave a virile in­
terpretation of "Thomas Mowbray, 
Duke of Norfolk,” and read his lines 
with his characteristic vigor and clear­
ness. The part could not have been in 
better hands.
Mr. James Church was most happily 
cast as the Earl of Salisbury. His 
voice has a sombre quality which, 
combined with his very measured de­
livery, leaves a very strong impression 
and suits, admirably the ill-omened 
message which he brings to the King.
Richard Mansfield II, as tlie “Bishop 
of Carlisle,” read his lines with great 
earnestness and dignity, while Carl 
Reid’s “Earl of Northumberland” was 
one of the very good things among the 
many small parts. Mr. Mulligan’s 
“groom,” in the cell in Pomfert Castle; 
was a piece of exceptionally fine act­
ing, breathing the most delicate 
pathos. The work of Mr. Theodore 
Viehman and Mr. Sudine McGonnell 
(as first and second gardener) in the 
exquisite scene in York’s Garden—Act 
III—desirves mention, because of the 
exceptional reading of their lines and 
the artistic interpretation of the two 
very brief roles. Mr. Herbert Kirk­
patrick gave a very acceptable inter­
pretation of the “Duke of Aumerle.”
The female roles in this piay are al­
most nihl—there being but three 
speaking parts, and these brief,1 the 
Queen to King Richard being the most 
important, which was entrusted to 
Miss Eula Guy. She “queens it” very 
well—wearing royal robes with consid­
erable dignity—but the strident qual­
ity of her voice does not accord with 
the pathetic tenor of most of the 
Queen’s speeches. She is not convinc­
ing in the role of “Isabella,” in that 
the characterization fails to excite 
sympathy, although she is very pleas­
ing to look upon. The other two roles 
were double-cast, the Duchess of Glou­
cester being played by Miss Lucy Bar­
ton and Miss Rubenstein, while the 
D.uchess of York was entrusted to Mrs. 
Violante Bollinger and Miss Hazel' 
Beck. Miss Bartow’s interpretation 
was of the severe and uncompromising 
type of distressed womanhood, due 
largely to the quality of voice used in 
reading her lines—from a pictorial 
point of view, it proved one of the 
most successful roles she has ever
essayed. Miss Rubenstein gave a 
softer interpretation to the role in 
every respect She possesses a re­
markably sympathetic voice which she 
u.es with discretion, avoiding at all 
Limes a forced delivery and approach­
ing her climaxes without the symp­
toms of physical distress which in­
variably result in an unpleasant gut­
tural quality of tone.
. There was a very similar contrast in 
the two interpretations of the “Duch­
ess of York.” Mrs. Bollinger being the 
strong, confidant woman, who brooks 
no refusal, determined to win her suit; 
while Miss Beck’s essentially feminine 
“Duchess” pleads quite as much 
through the mere fact of her woman­
hood as through her importunity—be­
ing a mother, she expects clemency 
for her son rather than demands it.
Every member of the cast contrib­
uted his best, whether it was much or 
little, and it was this admirable co­
operation that made the play the suc­
cess it was.
The performance was under the per­
sonal direction of B. Iden Payne, so 
that it goes without saying that the 
costumes and scenery were as they 
should be in such a production. All 
the stage settings were worthy of 
mention, particularly the “garden 
scene,” “Westminster Hall” and the 
scene on “the coast of Wales.” Mr. 
J. Woodman Thompson was respon­
sible for the pleasure afforded the au­
dience in this respect.
The department is to be congratu­
lated on their very successful Shake­
speare week. ,

1 to 0, was spiked in the shin by 
Batchelor. Batchelor who was steal­

stayed in the game, although pain­

Tech’s run in the first was a result 
of I-Iedlund’s base on balls, Doherty’s 
life at Hedlund’s expense, his steal 
of second, and an overthrow by 
catcher Daugherty. In the seventh 
Doherty doubled, Withers singled, 
Yeager bunted and Doherty was
caught at the plate. Gano singled

Grove City’s runs came as a re­

night that Pittsburgh skies had 
been clear for over a month. He 
said that it was the clearest that it 
had been for nearly a year. The
party certainly made the best of the 
occasion. The first and probably
the most interesting object observed 
was the planet, Saturn. Through the 
thirteen-inch elescope the planet and 
its luminous ring looked as though 
it were no more than a few hun­
dred miles away. Everyone had to 
take at least three looks at the pe­
culiar moon-like planet. There was 
a question as to how many of Sat­
urn’s satellities were visible. Sev­
eral of the party appeared to have 
good eyesight or else they were 
seeing stars of their own. The tele­
scope was next turned upon some 
of the fixed stars, Pollux, a double 
star, MIzar, one in the handle of the 
Great Dipper, and Vega, one of the 
most distant of the stars visible to 
us In the north. The Ring Nebulae 
and the cluster in Hercules were 
made interesting by the explanations 
of the Professor. All left with In­
tentions of returning when other ob­
jects are visible. Another party 
from Tech went over the next even­
ing, but it was cloudy, so the tele­
scope was useless.
The entire issue of the 1917 
Thistle has been delivered to the 
Thistle Board and distribution has 
been in progress during the past 
three weeks. There are, however, 
about two hundred books yet re­
maining in Mr. Gearhart's office 
awaiting to be called for. The Sales 
Manager wishes to urge all who 
have not yet called for their books 
to do so at their earliest conveni­
ence. As a result of the unsettled 
conditions about school, the board 
is especially anxious to get all the 
books distributed as soon as pos­
sible. Books may be secured at 
Mr. Gearhart’s office in the Central 
Building, any time during the day 
that the office is open.
All bills for pictures and space 
became due on the date of publica­
tion of the Thistle. If your account 
has not yet been taken care of, 
please see to it at once. It is 
necessary that all accounts be closed 
before examination week, so kindly 
assist the board by being prompt in 
the matter.

FORMER TECH STUDENT
WRITES FROM FRANCE
(Continued From Page One.)
I am looking forward to receiving 
the next number of the Alumnus, but 
It has not yet come along. In fact, 
letters are very slow In coming 
through at the present time.
You did’ well against Cornell. I am 
glad to hear of Tech coming along 
so well in the football world.
We are not very busy in our section 
at present, but the interesting and 
grewsome sights that we occasionally 
see on one of the greatest battlefields 
of the .nations remind us very forcibly 
of the fact that we may at any mo­
ment be working hard, day and night, 
with our ambulance, To see an old, 
deserted gun, with one ilesliless corpse 
poised on the wheel, one foot on the 
axle and the other lying over the top, 
the head dropped off and lying a grin­
ning skull with one jaw on the ground 
and close by the bones of a German 
with his uniform covering them and 
his skull with a tuft of hair sticking 
to it, and all around the eternal roar 
and the wavy sea of shell holes, half 
filled and entirely filled with water, 
helps one to realize what war means.
It eclipses everything, and the 
great majority of those engaged live 
from day to day in the present only, 
the unreal present of which the mis­
eries only are emphasized by mem­
ories of the past or vague hopes of 
the future. But every man in the 
trenches says, "There will be no more 
wars. The people will have their say 
in the future regarding all wars.” 
And yet all realize that it must be 
done, and the motto is "Fight on! 
Fight on!” One feels ashamed that 
one is not doing more.
With all good wishes to old friends 
at Tech.
Yours sincerely,
ALEX J. AIRSTON.

smashes. Jack’s play showed that it 
is only practice that he needs.
• Steen won. his match, but lie took 
some time with his careful lobbing. 
Turk cuts all his drives and proved 
steadier than Connell.
In doubles, Davis and Beatty took 
over Clark and Dodge in two straight 
sets. Manager Spring and Steen lost 
their match to Connell and Baileys.
Manager Spring announced that 
Kenyon College had cancelled their 
engagements, having disbanded. A

State wants a return match also. The
