On Wednesday, Oct. 5, 
Campus Police closed off Tech 
Street and sections of Marga-
ret Morrison Street to prepare 
for the arrival of Virginia leg-
islator and Vice Presidential 
candidate Senator Tim Kaine. 
The event took place the 
following afternoon and was 
set up just outside of Marga-
ret Morrison Carnegie Hall. 
The exterior of the building 
was scaled with patriotic 
banners, and an American 
?ag backdrop hung behind 
the podium along with the 
Clinton campaign’s slogan, 
“Stronger Together.”
Kaine was introduced by 
notable guest speakers such 
as Pennsylvania State Sena-
tor Jay Costa and Pennsylva-
nia Governor Tom Wolf. The 
politicians both emphasized 
the importance of voting and 
encouraged students to reg-
ister to vote and to volunteer 
for the campaign. Governor 
Wolf remarked, “Democracy 
does not expect a lot of its 
citizens but the fundamental-
ity of citizenship is to vote.” 
Pennsylvania is a major swing 
state in this election cycle, 
although it has voted with 
the Democratic nominee in 
every election since 1992. For 
an election that has proven 
to be surrounded by contro-
versy and high stakes, secur-
ing Pennsylvania could be a 
signi?cant victory for either 
of the candidates.
Once the Virginia sena-
tor took the stage, he began 
by denouncing Republican 
nominee Donald Trump and 
his running mate, Governor 
Mike Pence. He drew compar-
isons between the different 
visions of the two campaigns, 
speci?cally by juxtaposing 
the books published by the 
Democratic running mates 
and by Donald Trump. Kaine 
claimed that Trump’s book, 
which was originally titled 
“Crippled America,” was 
“fundamentally negative 
... which shows what he re-
ally thinks about the United 
States.” He urged the audi-
ence to ponder the difference 
between what the two cam-
paigns represented and to, 
“consider where the country 
is going.”

On Friday night, musicians 
from the Pittsburgh Sympho-
ny Orchestra gave a free con-
cert in Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity’s College of Fine Arts. 
This is one of the series of free 
concerts the musicians have 
presented to the public since 
their strike to replace the can-
celled concerts at Heinz Hall. 
Musicians from the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra 
went on strike due to a recent 
labor dispute: they rejected 
management’s last, best, and 
?nal offer on Thursday night, 
Sept. 29, which was a pro-
posal that they said would 
cut their salary by 15 percent, 
freeze their pensions, and re-
duce the size of the orchestra.
According to the press 
release from Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra’s ad-
ministration, the orchestra is 
going through an imminent 
?nancial struggle. While re-
questing pay cut from the 
musicians, they are also sig-
ni?cantly reducing admin-
istrative expenses. Accord-
ing to them, their last, best, 
and ?nal offer “would have 
ensured that the members 
of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra remained well 
compensated,” while also 
maintaining other bene?ts. 
Also, according to the admin-
istration, they are not asking 
to get rid of musicians’ pen-
sions, but rather to “allow 
all musicians who still have 
accounts in the old de?ned-
bene?t plan (DB) to retain 
what they’ve already earned 
and transition to the new 
de?ned-contribution (DC) 
plan.” In addition, they said 
they do not want to reduce 
the number of musicians, but 
to defer the hiring of three 
open positions. According to 
them, what they are trying to 
do is to “address fundamen-
tal ?nancial issues that can-
not be ignored any longer” 
by looking at every revenue 
source and every expense. 
The administrations say that 
they are unchanging to their 
commitment to artistic in-
tegrity and to world-class 
excellence, both musically 
and organizationally. Also, 
according to their press re-
lease, the administration says 
that they remain committed 
to reaching an agreement 
with the musicians, and that 
they are willing to negotiate 
with them.
According to the press 
release from the orchestra 
committee, “This dispute 
is really about saving Pitts-
burgh’s world-class orches-
tra, and we are very sorry 
that our management can-
celed a month’s concerts 
rather than return to nego-
tiations.” In the interview 
The Tartan conducted with 
Micah Howard, the orchestra 
committee chair, and Jeremy 
Branson, the vice-chair of the 
committee, both of whom are 
also professors at Carnegie 
Mellon University, they say 
that these drastic cuts would 
destroy the orchestra as it is 
now; they would not be able 
to recruit and retain the very 
best musicians. According 
to them, they are also will-
ing to negotiate, but since 
the management says they 
are only willing to negotiate 
if the musicians accept the 
drastic cuts, the musicians 
will not go back to the table 
“until they are ready to nego-
tiate for a fair contract that

A groundbreaking cer-
emony held last Tuesday 
marked the start of construc-
tion on a new building on 
campus dedicated to the Col-
lege of Engineering and to a 
recent partnership between 
Carnegie Mellon University 
and ANSYS. The plans for the 
anticipated 30,000 square 
foot facility were made pos-
sible by a generous gift from 
ANSYS, a global company 
that leads in engineering 
simulation software and is 
based near Pittsburgh.
The new ANSYS building 
will be located near Hamer-
schlag Hall and will feature a 
simulation and collaboration 
lab and a spacious “maker 
facility” for undergradu-
ate students to build full-
scale projects. It will also 
contain conference rooms, 
training and lecture space, 
and offices.
In addition to the space 
provided, “students will have 
access to simulation tools 
and cutting-edge technolo-
gies for the hands-on work 
that is a hallmark of our CMU 
education,” remarked James 
Garrett, Dean of the College 
of Engineering, referring to 
the modern simulation soft-
ware and expertise of indus-
try professionals that would 
be provided by ANSYS.
“Think of a space where 
you don’t just learn about 
the academics of how to de-
sign something ... but a space 
where you can get great 
minds together and you can 
actually have people conceive 
products, … assemble them, 
[and] actually make them 
using … advanced manu-
facturing techniques,” said 
James Cashman, president 
and CEO of ANSYS.
The ANSYS building’s 
proximity to Hamerschlag 
Hall places it next door to 
the redesigned Hamerschlag 
MakerWing, which includes 
fabrication and machining 
facilities, maker spaces, labs, 
and collaboration areas, pro-
viding a seamless transition 
from making components to 
assembling them into larger 
systems.
“We are grateful to ANSYS 
for the important education-
al opportunity this brings to 
students across our campus,” 
said Carnegie Mellon Presi-
dent Subra Suresh. “Through 
a variety of CMU initiatives, 
we have seen firsthand that 
maker spaces help students 
think more creatively and 
take a hands-on approach to 
solving critical problems.”
The collaboration 
between ANSYS and Carn-
egie Mellon University was 
announced in June and 
emerged from a mutual aspi-
ration to expand the educa-
tion of engineering students 
to be better prepared for 
the workforce, a challenge 
in a field whose reliance on 
hands-on skill and experi-
ence makes it difficult to 
teach entirely in a classroom.
It was a partnership that 
made sense, utilizing the 
broad intersection of re-
search expertise between 
two leaders in engineering, 
computer science, and 
simulation technologies. 
At the groundbreaking cer-
emony, Suresh divulged that 
he himself had worked on 
ANSYS simulation software 
in the past, and so was fa-
miliar with the company and 
their value.
The collaboration is ex-
pected to “touch diverse 
fields such as autonomous 
vehicles, additive manufac-
turing, biomedical devices, 
sustainability of physical 
products and connected 
products,” according to the 
ANSYS website.
In addition, the advent of 
the new ANSYS building re-
flects a revolution in manu-
facturing methods and prod-
uct innovation, referred to as 
Industry 4.0, that is “chang-
ing the way that products are 
designed and produced,” as 
described on the College of 
Engineering website. Tradi-
tional methods of developing 
products involved generating 
designs, then building and 
testing prototypes to iden-
tify design flaws, referred to 
as ‘build and break’ cycles. It 
was “costly, slow, and limit-
ing to product innovation,” 
according to Cashman, since 
if a prototype didn’t work, an 
engineer could potentially 
have to start the process 
from scratch.
Industry 4.0, heralded as 
the fourth industrial revolu-
tion, incorporates the use 
of physics-based computa-
tional tools to digitally test 
and discard millions of al-
ternative product designs 
and materials, without 
restriction, to pinpoint an 
optimal model for a product 
before a physical prototype 
is even built. The prototype 
becomes a final validation, 
rather than part of a long line 
of variants to test for flaws.
“Engineers can explore 
ideas as fast as they can 
imagine them, without be-
ing bogged down by the tra-
ditional process,” Garrett 
said. “This will eliminate 
barriers that keep new ideas 
from turning into actual 
products.”
In this way, the Carnegie 
Mellon–ANSYS partner-
ship aims to incorporate a 
greater use of simulation 
tools into education in order 
to empower the next gen-
eration of engineers. Engi-
neering simulation is cur-
rently mostly used by highly 
specialized experts, but 
promises vast improvements 
in innovation, energy ef-
ficiency, sustainability, 
and cost.
“By joining forces, ANSYS 
and Carnegie Mellon are in-
vesting in the future of en-
gineering,” Cashman stated. 
“We will enable students and 
industry collaborators to cre-
ate unprecedented levels of 
exploration and innovation 
by equipping all engineering 
students with the advanced 
tools and expertise they 
need.”
The multimillion dollar 
grant from ANSYS also pro-
vides for the endowment of an 
ANSYS Career Development 
Chair in Engineering. The 
Early Career Professorship 
will be awarded to a young 
faculty member conducting 
education and research in 
areas related to engineering 
simulation software.
The ANSYS building is 
projected to open in 2018. 
At the groundbreaking cer-
emony, Cashman gave a fi-
nal remark on the broader 
impact he hoped the part-
nership and facility would 
produce. “This is just the 
foundation … that allows 
institutions like Carnegie 
Mellon and ANSYS and other 
industrial partners to come 
together and find new ways 
to collaborate on research, 
on teaching, such that when 
this generation of engineers 
come out, they’re even all the 
better prepared to be able to 
deal with the challenges that 
are only going to get more 
stark and more compelling 
over the years,” Cashman 
stated. “We’re very excited 
about this … it is a starting 
point. It is step one.”

In recent years, 
Pittsburgh’s art and enter-
tainment industry has been 
on the economic rise. This 
opened doors for creative 
specialists in Allegheny 
County, where thousands of 
jobs were created.
Pittsburgh’s entertain-
ment and arts industry is 
widely driven by the Carn-
egie Mellon community. 
From those in Masters of 
Entertainment Industry 
Management, a joint pro-
gram offered by the H. 
John Heinz III College and 
the College of Fine Arts 
(CFA), to those in Master of 
Arts Management (MAM), 
students take on projects 
offered by internships 
and apprenticeships. 
These opportunities place 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-

lines of Pittsburgh culture, 
allowing them to mold 
and create a new face for 
art and technology. 
Pittsburgh “is very much 
an artist’s community along-

School of Drama debuts ?rst play of the fall: The Playboy of the Western World
Oct. 3 was the School of 
Drama’s preview night for 
their production of  The Play-
boy of the Western World.This 
is the ?rst production for the 
2016–17 season.
Written by Irish play-
wright laureate John Mil-
lington Synge, this play 
suggests that sometimes 
we don’t completely know 
the true nature of our loved 
ones. This phenomenon is 
based off of Synge’s percep-
tion of his own life where he 
utilizes comedy to reveal the 
darker side of life.
Peter Cooke, head of the 
School of Drama, describes 
this play as being “bold, 
provocative, caring and 
human,” as “it holds a mirror 
up to the magic Ireland of 
the 1900s.”
Serving as a true repre-
sentation of Ireland in the 
1900s, this play was met 
with great opposition when 
it was ?rst debuted in 1907. 
It was notoriously known to 
have caused riots because 
of its far-from-picturesque 
depiction of Ireland.
Carnegie Mellon’s The 
Playboy of the Western World 
runs from Oct. 6–15 in the 
Philip Chosky Theater.

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet Writer 
of The Student Government. 
The rising cost of educa-
tion in America and, for our 
purposes, at Carnegie Mellon 
has left many students feeling 
increasingly unstable in their 
?nancial standing. De?nitive 
measures can be taken to al-
leviate monetary stresses, 
such as applying for schol-
arships or reassessing bud-
gets, but another frequently 
visited solution is on-campus 
employment.
Being a student worker 
was a need, not a choice, for 
me. My ?rst year as a Desk 
Service Assistant was marked 
with bleary-eyed entrances at 
8 a.m., having already been 
awake for ?ve hours at that 
point to work a 4 to 8 a.m. 
“graveyard” shift which al-
lowed me to earn a special $9/
hr instead of $7.25/hr. While I 
was and am so grateful to have 
been able to work, I would 
have bene?ted from a more 
regular sleep schedule. How-
ever, I needed the extra pay 
in order to afford my necessi-
ties (textbooks, tuition, etc.), 
and didn’t want to sacri?ce 
?ve hours under regular wage 
during my day when I could be 
using that time to attend extra 
credit lectures or study group 
meetings. This wasn’t an easy 
decision, and despite the fact 
that I would frequently take 
on more of these “graveyard” 
shifts for a bigger paycheck, 
I still struggle ?nancially. I 
know I am not alone.
However, especially when 
compared to the respective 
minimum student wages at 
peer institutions with com-
parable endowments, such 
as Georgetown University 
(with an endowment of $1.53 
billion and minimum wage set 
at $11/hr per D.C. law), we 
might feel like we are alone 
in how our university regards 
what a living wage within 
a college schedule really is. 
Thankfully, change is in the 
works. Notably, a signi?cant 
push for raising the mini-
mum wage came from Evan 
Wineland of the Information 
System Class of 2015. Dur-
ing his run for Student Body 
President, Evan identi?ed in-
creasing student wages as one 
of three main initiatives to his 
campaign. Shortly after the is-
sue was brought to the main 
stage of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, the Division of 
Student Affairs (DoSA) raised 
their minimum wage to $7.75, 
effective this school year.
In matters pertaining to the 
main intention of this column, 
Student Government actively 
chooses to pay its workers 
above the DoSA standard, at 
$8.75/hr, and encourages oth-
er organizations to meet this 
goal. It’s so important to lead 
by example, and we choose 
this wage because we think 
it indicates a greater appre-
ciation of the work being done 
under these jobs, and allows 
students to indulge in their 
work with less hesitation of if 
they can afford to do so.
Here is the main takeaway: 
individual students can pro-
duce incredible change. We 
live through the student expe-
rience, we confront its respec-
tive challenges and rewards 
every day, and most of us have 
ideas on what could be im-
proved within student life at 
Carnegie Mellon. The impor-
tance of discussing the chal-
lenges we face, or the ideas we 
have lies in the school’s active 
reception of these issues and 
its precedent in reacting to 
suggestions. Why not try to 
speak about what you think 
would make Carnegie Mellon 
University better?

ROSEMARY HAYNES
Junior Staffwriter
On Thursday Oct. 5, a 
crowd of Pittsburgh communi-
ty members and Carnegie Mel-
lon students gathered in Mar-
garet Morrison to hear Hiba 
Krisht’s talk, “Veils, Virginity, 
and (In)visibility: On Being a 
Woman in Hezbollah Culture.” 
A member of the society Ex-
Muslims of North America, 
Krisht spoke of these issues 
in the context of personal 
experience.
The religion of Islam is 
divided into two sects — Shia 
and Sunni — that differ by be-
lief in who is the true “caliph,” 
the successor of the prophet 
Muhammad. Krisht explained 
that speci?c cities in Leba-
non are heavily dominated by 
Sunni Muslims and the same 
is equally true of Shia Mus-
lims. The country isn’t geo-
graphically split in two, but 
the strong religious divide dic-
tates the cultural expectations 
within each city.
In the beginning of the 
talk, a photograph of her from 
when she still lived with her 
family in Lebanon was pro-
jected above Krisht. In the 
photograph she stood in a hi-
jab; across her torso she held 
a machine gun. Krisht ex-
plained that, from looking at 
the speci?c restrictions of her 
clothing, it’s obvious she was a 
Shia Muslim. The Shia sect of 
Islam has stricter expectations 
of women in covering their 
body. The only part of the face 
that may be showing is what’s 
necessary for functioning. For 
Krisht, this meant she had to 
constantly make sure her hair 
hadn’t slipped out of the scarf, 
and that the scarf was pinned 
to hide the jawbone and chin. 
The scarf had to be draped 
over her chest and the rest of 
her clothing had to be loose 
?tting, covering her arms and 
legs completely. To ensure 
that when lifting an arm their 
wrists do not show, Shia wom-
en wear fake sleeves on their 
forearms. Women of Sunni 
Islam, however, are allowed 
to wear their head scarf more 
loosely, show their wrists and 
shins, and wear makeup.
In the Shia tradition, girls 
must wear the hijab from 
when they are nine lunar years 
of age; Krisht, like most girls, 
began wearing the hijab her 
last summer as an eight-year-
old so that she didn’t have to 
make the transition during 
the school year. Krisht de-
scribed that wearing a hijab 
is more than just a wardrobe 
addition — it’s adapting to a 
way of life. Girls are forced 
to adapt, to wear a hijab to 
protect their families’ honor; 
they are taught that their body 
is shameful and that it must 
be hidden from men. Being 
burdened with rigid expecta-
tions and beliefs at a prepu-
bescent age doesn’t give girls 
the opportunity to consider 
an alternative or even to 
understand the messages they 
are being led to believe about 
their body.
Because of the inequality 
for women in Muslim cul-
ture, the policies surrounding 
women’s rights can be hard 
to believe given the societal 
norms that surround us. If a 
Muslim woman does not ad-
here to the Islamic doctrines, 
it is considered a dishonor 
to her family. It is accept-
able in Muslim culture, even 
expected, that if a woman 
demonstrates rebellious be-
havior, she will be physically 
punished by her male family 
members. There are no laws in 
Lebanon to protect a woman 
from these crimes. In 2014, 
after much debate, a law was 
?nally passed stating that “do-
mestic violence” is illegal, but 
deliberately did not prohibit 
all violence against women.
It is legal for a man to rape 
his wife. If a man rapes a wom-
an that is not his wife and is 
convicted of rape, he can ?x 
his wrongdoing by proposing 
to his victim. This is because 
the crime is considered to be 
against the honor of the wom-
an’s family, not against the 
woman or her body.
The government in 
Lebanon not only struggles 
with issues of human rights, 
they also often fail to provide 
necessities like electricity, and 
have done little to nothing in 
helping to rebuild the country 
after the damage from the war 
in Syria. Because of this, in 
Shia regions like the one Hiba 
is from, the controlling power 
is Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a 
Shia Muslim militant group 
in Lebanon that is the only 
source of resources in most of 
the country. Not only do Shia 
Muslims praise Hezbollah for 
the salvation they’ve provid-
ed, Lebanese Christians and 
people of many other religious 
minorities in Lebanon praise 
Hezbollah.
After growing up 
suppressed by this culture for 
eighteen years, Krisht decided 
she must escape. Unfortu-
nately, Krisht quickly learned 
through a series of events that 
there was a lot she didn’t know. 
First, Krisht was denied access 
to leaving the country and be-
fore she could come up with 
any alternate plans, Hezbollah 
of?cers found her and brought 
her back to her family. Because 
her mother had ?led a missing 
person’s report, they had to go 
to the Lebanese police station 
to resolve the issue. This is 
when Krisht learned that there 
were no laws to protect her 
from the violence of honor 
crimes and that she must go 
back to her family. The last and 
most disheartening realization 
was back at school, when she 
found out that no one in her 
community was aware of what 
had just happened — that it 
was possible other women 
around her had tried to escape 
or felt the same way, but had 
no chance to speak up, for fear 
of endangering their lives.
Krisht was trapped in 
Lebanon and she was left with 
one option, to devote herself to 
the religion; she realized that 
the more you adhere to the 
system, the more the system 
will provide for you. Krisht 
was also lucky enough to come 
from a family that was able to 
send her to a good university, 
so she went to the Internation-
al College in Beirut. She stud-
ied philosophy and had to hide 
from her parents what “phi-
losophy” really meant so that 
they’d allow her to study it. 
She didn’t go into great detail 
about how she escaped Leba-
non to get to America, but she 
did say that it took multiple 
years of intricate planning to 
get here.
Now a member of the Ex-
Muslims of North America, 
Krisht shares her opinions

On Oct. 2, the eighth 
annual Donut Dash took 
place at Schenley Plaza in 
Oakland at 10 a.m. This 
event is hosted by the Greek 
organization Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon (SAE) at Carnegie 
Mellon University to raise 
fund for Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (ALS). Over 1,300 
participants signed up for the 
event prior to Sunday, and 
around 1,500 participants 
showed up to the event. Joey 
Pickens, a former member 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Men’s 
Track and Field team, won 
the competitive race.
The Donut Dash is a 
philanthropic event orga-
nized by students in the 
SAE fraternity. Participants 
may choose to partake in 
either the competitive race 
or the casual race; competi-
tive runners run a two-mile 
course, stopping after the 
first mile to eat six donuts. 
This year, this event helped 
SAE to raise $175,760, by 
far the largest amount of 
funds raised through an 
event hosted by one single 
Greek organization in the 
nation. This record was 
previously held by Alpha 
Epsilon Pi of University of 
Missouri in 2015, when the 
fraternity raised $132,000 
for American Cancer Soci-
ety. “[The Donut Dash] is 
a part of the commitment 
to raise $500,000 over five 
years for a new ALS research 
center at The University of 
Pittsburgh,” Mike McCaffrey, 
a senior statistics major at 
Carnegie Mellon, said at the 
closing speech.
David Ott, a current 
member of Carnegie Mellon 
SAE and a senior Materi-
als Science & Engineering 
and Biomedical Engineering 
major, organized The Do-
nut Dash 2016 with McCaf-
frey. Ott has been actively 
participating in The Donut 
Dash since his first year at 
Carnegie Mellon. The first 
annual Donut Dash took 
place in 2009 on Carnegie 
Mellon campus. The goal 
was to raise $2,000 for The 
Children’s Hospital of the 
University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center, because the 
national philanthropy of 
SAE was to support the Chil-
dren’s Miracle Network. In 
2012, Bob Dax, the alumni 
advisor of Carnegie Mellon’s 
SAE, was diagnosed with 
ALS. “That year, [SAE] re-
vamped the event to support 
ALS,” said Ott, “we respect 
Bob very much, and he had 
always been a very dedicated 
member of the chapter.”
About $23,000 was raised 
in Donut Dash 2012. In 2015, 
the Donut Dash was moved 
from Carnegie Mellon cam-
pus to Schenley Plaza, and 
the fundraising goal was 
raised to $100,000.
The majority of the 
donations came from 
corporate sponsors and 
alumni donations. SAE also 
worked closely with orga-
nizations such as Live Like 
Lou, an organization run by 
Neal and Suzanne Alexander 
to support the family of ALS 
patients. Many volunteering 
organizations and sorori-
ties on Carnegie Mellon also 
participated in the prepara-
tion process as well as at the 
event. Students from service 
fraternities at the University 
of Pittsburgh also showed up 
to help organize the event. 
“We have been preparing 
for this event since our last 
Donut Dash,” said Ott, “and 
for us this is definitely the 
biggest event of the year.” 
As the heads of this event, 
Ott and McCaffrey were 
responsible for maintaining 
their cooperation with cor-
porate sponsors and service 
organizations, while mak-
ing sure the event gained 
special permission from the 
city of Pittsburgh. Most of 
the brothers of SAE showed 
up to help organize the event 
and they also worked with 
local police.
The races ended at 1:30 
p.m, and were followed by 
a donut eating contest and 
a live music performance at 
Schenley Plaza.
CMU chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon broke fundraising record at this year’s Donut Dash 
Besides criticizing the 
Republican ticket, Kaine 
spoke on several of the top-
ics that were addressed dur-
ing the Vice Presidential 
Debate on Tuesday night, 
such as college affordabil-
ity, immigration reform, 
women’s health, and taxes. 
Kaine, who has taken mod-
erate stances on many con-
stitutional issues, asserted 
during the Vice Presidential 
Debate on Tuesday night 
that he is a strong supporter 
of the Second Amendment. 
Kaine’s nomination as the 
vice presidential nominee on 
the Democratic ticket could 
have been a strategic move to 
secure votes from moderate 
voters, while Clinton focuses 
on securing votes from the 
mid-to-far-left population.
Kaine showed his 
moderate ideologies once 
again during the event on 
campus, when he was dis-
cussing Clinton’s policy ob-
jectives for women’s health. 
He assured that, “I’m proud 
of my faith, but I don’t think 
my job is to pass laws man-
dating that everybody follow 
the doctrines of my church.” 
He continued, “on these fun-
damental matters of repro-
duction and relationships 
and intimacy, why would we 
want a big government mak-
ing these decisions?” Kaine 
also said that he and Clinton 
were determined to make it a 
priority to make college debt-
free for American families, 
with free tuition at in-state 
levels for families with an 
annual income of less than 
$125,000. He also promoted 
comprehensive immigration 
reform as well as tax relief 
to middle class families and 
small businesses.
Furthermore, Kaine 
emphasized Carnegie Mel-
lon’s signi?cance in Pennsyl-
vania and its role in creating 
the policies that he and Clin-
ton hope to achieve in the 
White House. He reminded 
the audience that Pittsburgh 
is the center of American 
manufacturing, and that 
Carnegie Mellon University 
lays at the center of this, 
as the school has joined 
the National Network for 
Manufacturing Institution. 
He stated that, “the plan for 
economic growth and manu-
facturing goes hand in hand 
with Carnegie Mellon.”
The senator seemed 
optimistic about the quickly-
approaching election day, 
and referred to himself as a, 
“rabbit’s foot for good luck,” 
joking that the reason Clinton 
picked him to be her running 
mate was due to him having 
never lost a political race. 
Kaine claimed, “I’m 8–0, and 
we’ll be 9–0 on November 
8th.” Despite this seemingly 
con?dent attitude, he alleged 
he was adopting an underdog 
mentality and the importance 
of reminding himself that, “I 
am the underdog until they 
call me the winner.” Kaine 
said that his running mate 
embraced the same mental-
ity, given that she is the ?rst 
woman to ever be nominated 
as a presidential candidate in 
United States history.
V.P. candidate Tim  Kaine visits CMU
addresses the artistic needs 
balanced out with the ?nan-
cial issues.” In their perspec-
tive, the management should 
come back to the table and 
tell the musicians what it 
takes to maintain artistic 
excellence of the orchestra, 
rather than focusing only on 
?nancial issues.
In fact, ?nancial crisis and 
strike are not unique to the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Or-
chestra; orchestras around 
the country are dealing with 
similar issues. In 2013, the 
San Francisco Symphony 
went on strike after reject-
ing a contract proposal from 
the administration. And 
similar stories can be found 
throughout the country. In 
Minneapolis, strikes also 
led to large cancellations. 
The economic crisis in 2008 
produced huge ?nancial 
quandaries for orchestras in 
the country, which lead to 
the closure of the Honolulu, 
Syracuse, and Albuquerque 
symphonies. In April 2011, 
the Philadelphia Orchestra, 
which is one of the top or-
chestras in the country, ?led 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection. Some of these 
orchestras reorganized, and 
Philadelphia emerged from 
bankruptcy in July 2012 with 
a freeze in hiring, cut in the 
size of the orchestra, and a 
cut in pay for the remaining 
performers. According to the 
press release from Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra’s ad-
ministration, “while a few 
organizations have begun to 
face these issues successfully, 
others have postponed fun-
damental change with short-
term steps — admittedly, as 
the Pittsburgh Symphony 
did for many years.”
Carnegie Mellon 
University is closely related 
to the Pittsburgh Sympho-
ny Orchestra. According to 
Professor Howard, 22 Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra 
musicians teach at Carnegie 
Mellon University; thus the 
strike could negatively in?u-
ence the school. According 
to him, if great musicians 
leave for other symphonies, 
then in addition to the suffer-
ing of the orchestra, the city, 
and the patrons, Carnegie 
Mellon University will lose 
many great teachers, which 
could harm Carnegie Mellon 
University’s music reputa-
tion and cause students to go 
elsewhere. However, on the 
bright side, one of the ben-
e?ts of the strike, according 
to Professor Branson, is that 
music students in the uni-
versity get to witness their 
professors ?ght for the orga-
nization, which is a knowl-
edge bene?cial for their fu-
ture, although gained in a 
terrible way.
According to Branson, al-
though the strike is not some-
thing we want to see, it is not 
a sign that classical music is 
dying, as some people say. As 
he said in the interview, in 
the past, an orchestra job was 
a part time job; the fact that 
there are right now many or-
chestras that didn’t exist ?fty 
years ago and that there are 
numerous orchestra jobs now 
shows that there is a huge au-
dience who supports classical 
music. According to Branson 
and Howard, in spite of the 
occasional labor disputes, 
Pittsburgh can and has sus-
tained a great orchestra for 
the past 120 years, and will 
continue be able to do so in 
the future.

* Denotes executive committee 
member
In the fall of 2015, Danny Meyer, 
CEO of Union Square Hospitality 
Group and founder of Shake Shack, 
announced his intention to elimi-
nate tipping at all 13 of his New 
York restaurants by the end of this 
year, beginning with his spot inside 
the Museum of Modern Art, called 
Modern. The driving force behind 
this bold business move is the desire 
for equality within the restaurant. A 
restaurant depends on two groups of 
people for it to run successfully — 
service staff in the front, and food 
preparation staff in the back. Given 
this divide, American labor laws cre-
ate an even wider gap between the 
front and back of house.
When Franklin D. Roosevelt 
penned the New Deal in 1938, he 
left out a minimum wage for tipped 
workers. And in the nearly 80 years 
since, that minimum has slowly 
inched its way up to $2.13. This legis-
lated divide essentially puts the onus 
on the customer — not the employer 
— to pay servers a living wage.
In successful restaurants like 
Meyer’s Modern, where the service 
is sure to be excellent and diners 
are wealthy enough to throw down 
a generous tip, servers can end up 
getting paid even more than their 
counterparts in the kitchen. Tension 
builds among hardworking cooks 
who get paid a set hourly wage that 
can’t compete. And for restaurants 
like Modern to ?x this, it means 
?xing the income of the server to 
where it currently is, and raising the 
?xed income of cooks to equal serv-
ers’. This results in price hikes up to 
40 percent.
Modern and others in the Union 
Square Hospitality Group have been 
successful with this effort because 
the clientele can afford to pay the 
higher menu prices. But the real-
ity is, the vast majority of American 
servers are not white males working 
at ?ne dining institutions. They’re 
women working at chain spots like 
Applebee’s and Olive Garden where 
the model is affordability.
The price adjustments required to 
include service would cause the busi-
nesses to implode. In the majority of 
American restaurants, the switch to 
service charges is much dicier.
Tipping in America, though it 
may seem in-
grained in 
our culture, 
is actually 
a relic borrowed from Europe cen-
turies ago, but has since been out-
lawed with the help of labor unions. 
It ?rst made its way to America in 
the 1850s and 60s, coming back with 
wealthy white travelers who wanted 
to show off their cultural know-how 
to seem more European. The Ameri-
can manifestation of that urge was 
that the only tipped workers were 
newly freed slaves following the Civ-
il War. They were tipped so that no 
employer would have to be respon-
sible for paying their wages, and the 
practice only served as one of many 
ways to hinder freed slaves’ integra-
tion into freedom. In fact, it was con-
sidered out-of-the-question to tip a 
white person, because it was a prac-
tice “reserved for ‘Negroes’”.
Even though the practice may 
seem innocent today, it still serves 
a similar purpose of perpetuating a 
system that separates classes. And 
the racial element isn’t gone. Ac-
cording to The New York Times, “53 
percent of tipped workers in New 
York State are minorities, and 21 
percent live at or below the poverty 
line.”
The racial implications of the sys-
tem are worsened exponentially by 
the gender issues: estimates from 
the Restaurant Opportunities Cen-
ter (ROC) show that two-thirds of 
tipped workers are women, and 36 
percent of those women are moth-
ers. The statistics also show that 
tipped workers use 1.7 times the 
amount of food stamps of the rest of 
the workforce.The system of tipping 
openly disadvantages already disad-
vantaged populations, allowing em-
ployers to get away with not paying 
them living wages.
Tipping inherently creates two 
groups: the tipper and the tippee. 
The served and the server. And the 
person on the receiving end essen-
tially becomes the server’s boss. 
Whether or not they go home with 
a day’s wage depends on the satis-
faction of each and every boss that 
sits in their section that day. And for 
many of these women, satisfying a 
customer forces them to tolerate in-
tolerable behavior.
In fact, the restaurant industry 
accounts for 37 percent, a plural-
ity, of national sexual harassment 
claims, even though it only accounts 
for 7 percent of working 
women, according to ROC data. This 
nightmare is a reality for millions 
of women in America who need to 
make a decent living, both for them-
selves and for the families that de-
pend on them.
On top of it all, wage theft is a 
huge problem in America. According 
to a report by the Economic Policy 
Institute state legislators have re-
cently trended toward passing bills 
that weaken labor standards across 
the board. 
Because of lax regulations, em-
ployers are able to get away with 
paying workers below minimum 
wage, withholding overtime com-
pensation, denying breaks, and, of 
course, stolen tips. Restaurants are 
also legally responsible for making 
up the difference if a worker’s tip 
doesn’t close the gap between the 
tipped and national minimum wage, 
but they’re rarely held to this stan-
dard. Wage theft happens in several 
industries, but 10 percent of all wage 
theft claims come from restaurant 
workers. This may not even account 
for all cases, depending on an em-
ployee’s knowledge of their rights 
and ?nancial ability to pursue the 
claim.
The system of tipping in America 
is broken. It doesn’t always work the 
way it should. The median annual 
income for a server only amounts 
to $19,250, and depending on how 
many people that income supports, 
it may not keep a family above the 
Federal Poverty Line. The solution, 
however, is not to outlaw tips. The 
average diner won’t like the high-
er menu prices, and the industry 
wouldn’t survive that shift.
But a $2.13 minimum wage for 
tipped workers is not acceptable. 
The government cannot continue to 
allow employers to rely on custom-
ers to pay their employees living 
wages. Tips should be supplemental 
to the income, and not the income 
itself. The workforce of tipped work-
ers deserves to earn the same mini-
mum wage as the rest of the nation. 
The two-tiered minimum wage sys-
tem only serves to further economic, 
gender, and racial inequalities in 
America that have persisted for too 
long. 
Servers are an integral part of 
the American workforce, and they 
deserve wages that 
re?ect the re-
spect they earn 
every day.

Voter registration ends tomorrow, get registered
Tomorrow Oct. 11 is the last day to 
register to vote in Pennsylvania. It’s 
imperative that everyone, regardless 
of party af?liation or political pref-
erence, is able to make their voice 
heard in the upcoming election.
Even if you don’t like any candi-
date running for a position, one of 
the choices will end up in of?ce and 
will be representing you in the gov-
ernment. There are options beyond 
just the major parties and voting 
for the candidate that agrees most 
closely with you will make your 
opinion count.
Finally, one vote may be very un-
likely to swing an election, but peo-
ple failing to turn out to vote can and 
does change the outcomes of elec-
tions. Low voter turnout can not only 
change the outcome, but also hurts 
the legitimacy of the victor.
The mindset that a vote doesn’t 
matter spreads and can cause a lot 
more damage than just the loss 
of one vote. Data journalism site 
?vethirtyeight.com currently has the 
Pennsylvania Senate race close to a 
50/50 tie. The race for attorney gen-
eral, which often has dismal turnout, 
is considered a tossup by the maga-
zine Governing. 
It’s important that everyone 
weighs in on these results so our rep-
resentation best matches us.
Voters can register at booths set 
up around campus, in person at gov-
ernment buildings such as the DMV, 
or online at pavoterservices.com.
CALEB GLICKMAN
Four weeks ago, I began my  se-
ries defending the two-party sys-
tem. As we approach the election, I 
will discuss a few other related top-
ics that very much need their own 
columns. To kick things off, we have 
a doozy this week – the Electoral 
College.
We mentioned the Electoral Col-
lege often in our discussion about 
the two-party system, and it is one 
of the key parts of that system’s 
foundation. We will discuss this, 
why it’s good, why it’s bad, and how 
it might be changed to better re?ect 
the results of the popular vote.
We hear a lot about the Electoral 
College during presidential con-
tests, but perhaps some of you have 
forgotten what you learned about it 
in 11th grade government. It is es-
tablished in Article II, Section I of 
the Constitution. 
The Founders set up the Elec-
toral College as a way to prevent di-
rect democracy. Essentially, people 
are selected in each state to repre-
sent the outcome of the election by 
casting their votes as electors. This 
is one of many reasons why we say 
“for the Republic,” in the Pledge 
of Allegiance and not “for the De-
mocracy.” Except for Nebraska and 
Maine, the Electors vote in a winner-
take-all system, so if someone wins 
more than 50 percent of a state’s 
votes, the gets 100 percent of the 
electoral votes.
This means that 538 people 
(representing the 435 Representa-
tives, 100 Senators, and three votes 
for the District of Columbia) are 
selected to vote, 41 days after the 
November 8th election, to pick the 
President. That’s the only vote that 
matters. There is nothing in the 
Constitution prohibiting any elector 
from not voting for the person that 
the state’s electorate selected. This 
is called a “faithless elector” and 
it has happened dozens of times in 
our history.
In principle, each elector would 
equally represent a portion of the 
population. However, the Consti-
tution mandates that each state is 
allotted three electoral votes and 
the rest are allotted for population. 
This means that small states that 
get three electoral votes, like some 
of those states in the middle that do 
not have many people (sorry Wyo-
ming), are overrepresented next to 
states with larger populations like 
California, Texas, and New York.
One would think this means 
small states get more attention, but, 
sorry small states, they don’t. Nei-
ther do big states. Elections come 
down to ideologically-mixed states 
we lovingly call “swing states.” (If 
you are holding this paper, you are 
living in one.) Candidates nowadays 
can ignore the states they will win 
easily and focus their resources on 
the states that will push their elec-
toral count over 270. Florida, Penn-
sylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and 
Iowa are the ones that typically de-
cide which candidate has the edge 
in the electoral count.
This brings us to one of the main 
problems with the Electoral Col-
lege: that someone can win with a 
minority of the popular vote. Most 
recently, George W. Bush beat Al 
Gore in the Electoral College in the 
2000 election, even though he lost 
the popular vote.
This result has happened three 
other times in our history. In 1824 
(deadlocked vote went to Con-
gress), 1876, and 1888, presidential 
contests resulted in a candidate who 
lost the vote but won the election. 
That’s one incorrect result for every 
14 elections. For such a consequen-
tial position, that is a staggering sta-
tistic. According to Business Insider, 
someone could win the Electoral 
College with just 22 percent of the 
popular vote. No, you didn’t misread 
that. It’s highly unlikely, but a can-
didate could win the election with 
51 percent in only the states that are 
most overrepresented and no votes 
in the rest of the states.
Now, if you’re thoroughly upset 
at this point, I would like to step in 
with an unpopular counterargu-
ment just to make you even angrier. 
The Electoral College, although out-
dated and undemocratic, does typi-
cally ensure one thing: the winner 
is usually chosen by electors from 
all 50 states. It makes sense that the 
people running for president must 
appeal to people nationwide. With-
out the Electoral College, a candi-
date could appeal to a section of 
the population that is concentrated 
in one area and become president, 
ignoring the interests of the rest 
of the country.
Still, this does not outweigh the 
problems with the current system. 
This leads me to the ?nal part of our 
discussion: reforms!
But how could we possibly re-
form such a system, you wonder? To 
begin with, there is one current pro-
posed reform making its way across 
the country: The National Popular 
Vote Interstate Compact, or NPVIC 
(it just rolls off the tongue, I know).
NPVIC is a nationwide pact be-
tween states that would award all 
of their electoral votes to the win-
ner of the national popular vote. 
The NPVIC will go into effect na-
tionwide if the number of states 
that have approved it reaches 270 
electoral votes. 
Although this is a clever way to 
basically rid the country of the Elec-
toral College in favor of a popular 
vote for president, the pact’s chances 
of success look grim. So far, 10 states 
and D.C. have signed on, making a 
hefty sum of 165 electoral votes.
Every single one of these states 
however, votes extremely Demo-
cratic in presidential contests. Ac-
cording to FiveThirtyEight, the 11 
signers of the pact are in the group 
of 14 states that gave President 
Obama his largest margins of victory 
in the 2012 election.
As we have seen in previous dis-
cussions, Democrats have won the 
last ?ve of six popular votes, mean-
ing they would be far more willing 
to make this change. This does not 
bode well for bi-partisanship.
Still, Gallup polling shows that 
nationally, 62 percent of people sup-
port amending the Constitution in

On Monday, about 30,000 men 
and women ?ooded the streets of 
Warsaw, Poland ?lling Castle Square 
in protest against a proposed blan-
ket abortion ban. They joined tens 
of thousands of people in ninety cit-
ies across Poland, dressed in black 
and holding signs, a high point of 
the protesting that had started two 
weeks before.
The bill in question, written by an 
organization called Stop Abortion, 
would have criminalized all abor-
tions in Poland. Monday’s protests, 
however, caught the government off 
guard, and by Wednesday the poli-
ticians that had supported the ban, 
backed down.
The success of the protests are a 
major victory for pro-choice advo-
cates in Poland. Even without the 
proposed ban, Poland has some of 
the most restrictive anti-abortion 
laws in Europe. Abortion is only 
permitted in the cases of severe fetal 
defects, a pregnancy resulting from 
rape or incest, or a serious threat to 
the mother’s life.
Of course, Poland is not the only 
country debating the legality of 
abortion. Abortion is a hot-button 
topic across the world, and an ex-
tremely controversial topic in Amer-
ican politics. Pro-life advocates seek 
to create anti-abortion legislation in 
order to reduce abortions, usually 
on ethical grounds.
Abortion bans, and even restric-
tive abortion policies like those in 
Poland, are often proposed with 
the aim to “save babies.” In fact, ac-
cording to The Guardian, a mem-
ber of the Polish parliament had, 
before the protests, denounced 
opponents of the ban as “fans 
of killing babies” who should be 
ashamed of themselves.
But abortion legislation should 
not be a question about the safety 
of the baby as much as it should be 
a question about the safety of the 
mother. Banning abortions does not 
actually reduce abortions. Women 
who seek abortions do not seek 
abortions because they are conve-
nient; they seek them out of neces-
sity and desperation. Banning abor-
tion will not prevent women from 
getting abortions — it will prevent 
women from getting safe, legal abor-
tions. It will force women in desper-
ate situations to look for potentially 
harmful, illegal termination options.
Abortion bans also prevent a 
woman’s access to important prena-
tal medical procedures. Under Po-
land’s proposed ban, doctors would 
not have been allowed to admin-
ister amniotic ?uid testing, or any 
other invasive procedures, because 
invasive prenatal procedures carry 
a minor risk of miscarriage. With 
the incredible advances in prenatal 
care, these procedures have been 
able to correct a variety of problems 
and provide a wealth of informa-
tion about the child before birth. 
To limit the access that new parents 
and doctors have to these options is 
unnecessarily dangerous to both the 
mother and the child.
Furthermore, the decision to car-
ry or terminate a pregnancy should 
not be left up to anyone besides the 
woman whose body is in question. 
There are inherent risks in abortion, 
as there are with any medical pro-
cedure, but there are also inherent 
risks in childbirth. No one should be 
able to tell a woman which risks she 
must take with her health or with 
her body.
Pro-choice advocates are not 
looking to encourage the death of 
infants. The 116,000 Polish protest-
ers that stormed the cities were not 
protesting for their right to kill ba-
bies. Instead, they were looking to 
ensure that women have rights over 
their own bodies, access to safe med-
ical prenatal care, and the option to 
safely and legally terminate a preg-
nancy if that is what is necessary.
When women have the right to 
choose, they have autonomy over 
their own lives and bodies. This au-
tonomy is something worth ?ghting 
for, and something that should nev-
er be called into question.

Death penalty disregards human life
Doctors misdiagnose patients due to bias, risk serious harm
Simin Li/Staff Artist

CHIE WACH
If there’s anything that these 
horribly splintered political parties 
of ours can agree on, it’s the value of 
human life. Black Lives Matter and 
Pro-Life protesters raise their signs 
because of one core, irrevocable con-
viction that spans any group: human 
life is precious, and we as a people 
and as a government have a duty to 
protect it.
Except, apparently, the lives of 
criminals. This is a glaring hypoc-
risy in American idealism: despite 
our professedly sacred values of the 
importance of human life, the death 
penalty continues to be supported 
and funded by the federal govern-
ment. Texas alone has executed 538 
people since 1976. Executions have 
decreased in recent years, but the 
inconsistency in our federal govern-
ment’s values persists: capital pun-
ishment should be abolished, wholly 
and completely. Waiting for the 
states to get rid of this cruel practice 
one by one doesn’t re?ect any deci-
sive rejection by our country. As The 
New York Times reported last week, 
“For the ?rst time in almost half a 
century, support for the death pen-
alty has dipped below 50 percent in 
the U.S.” Americans are realizing the 
hypocrisy.
It is still appalling, however, that 
49 percent of Americans support 
capital punishment. Some may sup-
port it simply because 
they believe it to be 
too expensive to 
keep our worst 
criminals in prison 
for life, yet this pro-
cess of legalized 
murder is so inef-
?cient and lengthy 
that the cost of kill-
ing someone isn’t 
very different 
from the cost of 
keeping them 
in prison.
Others may 
support it as 
a deterrent to 
criminals from 
committing 
these atrocious crimes, for fear of re-
ceiving a death sentence. However, 
there remains no substantial proof 
of this — in fact, a group of crimi-
nologists at the University of Texas 
at Dallas conducted an extensive 
study in 2009 that concluded that 
there was “no empirical support for 
the argument that the existence or 
application of the death penalty de-
ters prospective offenders from com-
mitting homicide.” Regardless of the 
data, it is doubtful that a criminal 
would hesitate to commit an offense 
in Pennsylvania, where the death 
penalty is legal, rather than in New 
York, where it is not.
Yet, although there is no vis-
ible reason for its continuation, the 
United States continues this archaic 
practice, in cheerful company with 
China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. 
We, with our glittering international 
reputation, are also invariably used 
as the justi?cation for the use of 
the death penalty in countries with 
poorer justice systems.
We, as Americans, pride our-
selves on our high moral standard, 
the central values of the Constitu-
tion that differentiate us from other, 
less democratic, countries. One of 
the most essential convictions of 
the Constitution, however, is that 
against “cruel and unusual 
punishment.” This famously vague 
command has been debated in many 
contexts, but in this case it is de?ni-
tive.
Once sentenced, the offender 
waits for roughly 15 years, through 
innumerable appeals that circulate 
and bounce back and forth in the le-
gal system, before the actual execu-
tion. They are also usually sentenced 
to solitary con?nement during this 
time, as opposed to other inmates 
in the prison. Regardless of the ac-
tual punishment, this wait for death, 
alone, for over a decade, is unargu-
ably cruel and unusual.
The execution at the end is even 
more so, for despite the efforts to 
create a ‘humane’ death, there have 
been many horrible accidents. An 
unforgettably awful case is that 
of Clayton Lockett, in which the 
botched administration of drugs 
caused him to endure over 40 min-
utes of agony after sedation.
There are a lot of stories and sta-
tistics that can be cited about this is-
sue, but the baseline is this: we, as a 
civilized nation, do not have the au-
thority to end a human life. It is an 
accepted belief that life is precious 
and sacred, and despite the many 
atrocities that may have been com-
mitted, we do not have the moral au-
thority to end it. 
It is hypocritical to condemn oth-
er countries, and our own citizens, 
for their executions, while partici-
pating in it ourselves.
While the government 
claims not have the authority to 
force state governments to end 
capital punishment, 
it can still declare 
a moratorium 
on the death 
penalty for fed-
eral crimes. As 
a country that 
unfailingly de-
fends the value 
of life and dig-
nity, this would 
be a powerful 
message to 
the rest of the 
world.

“It’s nothing — she’s a girl, and 
girls over-exaggerate their pain!”
One month later and I was com-
mitted to a wheelchair for the next 
?ve months.
Being overlooked by doctors as a 
result of their own personal biases 
can often leave their patients with se-
rious untreated medical conditions. 
Misdiagnosis is the third leading 
cause of death in the United States 
— and certainly bias must play a role. 
I was lucky that it was only severe 
stress fractures in my feet that got 
neglected by an orthopedic surgeon, 
but for others, not being taken seri-
ously by a doctor may be a matter of 
life and death. Such was the case with 
Elle Mayday, who, after complaining 
of lower back pain, was told simply 
to engage in exercises to strengthen 
her core. Fast forward after repeated 
encounters of not being evaluated 
seriously to her real diagnosis: stage 
III ovarian cancer. Had she not per-
sisted for a thorough examination, 
she might well be dead.
Patients face doctor discrimina-
tion on multiple platforms — gender, 
race, weight, religious or political 
beliefs. In a recent national survey, 
40 percent of doctors reported feel-
ing bias towards patients due to dif-
ferent factors. However, 85 percent 
claimed that this bias did not affect 
the way they treated their patients. 
But are those who admit to bias re-
ally in a position to objectively evalu-
ate whether or not it affects their 
practice? And what about those who 
don’t admit to their bias? Does that 
make it even worse?
If I hadn’t insisted that my feet 
hurt terribly and if I had gotten an 
MRI any later, the bones in my feet 
may have “shattered” completely 
and led to an even more complicated 
and dif?cult recovery. At the time 
of my injury I was on a soccer team 
and technically playing on two due 
to the shortage of players on the ju-
nior varsity team in my high school. 
I relayed that fact to the doctor dur-
ing the ?rst visit and it should have 
been taken into consideration as val-
id indicator that I might have gotten 
somehow injured.
Yet, because the X-rays did not 
show any sign of injury, I was told to 
merely “take it easy” and take ibu-
profen if I experienced pain. I ?nally 
had an MRI taken upon my mother’s 
demanding it from the doctor, and 
when the surgeon examined it he 
sheepishly admitted “I did not be-
lieve you were in so much pain,” and 
ordered me to stay off my feet, scoot 
around the house on my derriere and 
knees, and not return to school until 
I had my wheelchair, an object I was 
glued to over the course of the next 
?ve months.
Expressing personal bias leads 
doctors to provide inferior care to 
patients with the same medical con-
dition that would get much more at-
tention and better treatment from a 
different doctor without the bias or 
someone aware of his or her own bi-
ases and able to overcome them. Of-
ten times, women get less medical at-
tention than men and are dismissed 
as being too emotional and exag-
gerating their physical discomfort. 
A large part of me thinks that this is 
the result of a male dominated ?eld, 
particularly when it leads to neglect 
as the result of perpetuating assump-
tions related to gender.
This disparity in care is also wide-
spread among obese patients, who 
feel that their doctors fail to take 
them seriously, unwilling to look past 
the large numbers on the scale. Such 
was the experience with Patty Nece, 
who sought an orthopedist after in-
creasing hip pain. Her doctor, with-
out even properly examining her, 
provided her with an “obesity pain” 
diagnosis. Only later she discovered 
she had scoliosis, a condition unre-
lated to her obesity.
Doctors are human beings and, as 
is the case with humans in general, 
are not error-free, and their reason-
ing is subjected to emotional and 
psychological factors, skewing their 
objectivity. However, the nature of 
their work and the responsibility for 
protecting human life that rests on 
their shoulders puts them in a unique 
position of moral obligation to strive 
for high self-awareness.
It is ironic that someone who is 
a doctor — the person you trust to 
take care of your health 
— can turn you away 
by something 
as trivial as a 
difference in perspective or not take 
you seriously for the matter of a 
chromosome! Can one even call such 
a person a ‘professional?’ Have they 
even earned the title?
 While there is a new trend in help-
ing doctors become more observant 
by taking art classes, as in the case of 
medical training at Temple Univer-
sity according to NPR’s BBC World 
Service, more training in self-aware-
ness, a type of Gestalt-training estab-
lished by Fritz Perls, who strived for 
teaching people to reach their core, 
sticking to the indisputable reality, 
and shedding their inhibitions and 
inferiority or su-
periority 
complexes, would result in more 
doctors being ready to admit their 
own limitations and seeing their pa-
tients through the lens of their medi-
cal knowledge rather than their per-
sonal opinions and hidden biases.
The doctors themselves and their 
reasoning are the tools of their work. 
So why is all the training technical? 
Where is the training or evaluation 
for interpersonal intelligence?
So I leave you with this — give 
me a break. There should be no ?ne 
script “terms and conditions” to tak-
ing care of someone’s life. The year 
is 2016 (further con?rmation of this 
fact can be found on the front 
of this paper). We have 
the means, we have 
the technology, and 
the reason we don’t 
have the diagnosis is 
a matter of personal 
preference? In order 
to rule a condition 
out, you have to take 
it into account ?rst and 
evaluate it before you 
can determine it not to be 
a possible factor or a diagnosis. 
It’s not a matter of pay, nor 
is it a matter of working 
overtime. It’s a matter of 
meeting the patient at a 
basic level of human-
to-human respect and 
maintaining high 
moral standards.

In an attempt to address inclusion, 
the University of Michigan rolled 
out a decision last week allowing its 
students to choose their preferred 
designated pronoun. The selected 
pronoun will then become the stu-
dent’s identi?er in class rosters and 
among friends.
Before I dive deeper into the is-
sue, for all the non-grammar fans 
who are reading this article, a des-
ignated pronoun is a pronoun that 
an individual chooses for himself so 
that others use this identi?er to refer 
him (he, she, her, him, etc.). Its usage 
is fairly simple as your introduction. 
For example, ‘Hi, my name is X. My 
pronouns are she/her/hers and my 
major is Y.’ The University of Michi-
gan has urged its students to use he, 
she, ze — a gender neutral pronoun 
— or any new self-created pronoun.
The issue of gender inclusion 
was brought to notice by a petition 
on Change.org titled, ‘Have the Uni-
versity of Michigan Put Student Pro-
nouns on Class Rosters’. The petition 
says that “trans students at the Uni-
versity of Michigan often ?nd them-
selves facing threats to their mental 
and physical safety.” The seriousness 
of the matter can be well estimated 
by the fact that this petition was 
started last semester and presently 
has 796 supporters. The Pronoun 
Committee at the University of Mich-
igan took the students’ grievances 
into consideration and gave in?nite 
pronoun choices to the students.
The University believes that it is 
important to identify, respect and 
nurture all gender identities in order 
to promote a healthy community. 
The role of faculty is paramount to 
the effectiveness of this new policy 
and therefore, the university has 
requested its faculty to revise their 
rosters around mid-late October, 
thereby giving students the required 
time to select their names.
While you might have already 
started coming up with names for 
yourself and probably thinking that 
this is a great move by the Univer-
sity of Michigan, let us talk about 
what students at the University 
actually think.
The students are mocking 
this move!
They are claiming that this policy 
mocks the English language and is 
totally ridiculous — that allowing 
students to choose from an in?nite 
number of pronouns is bizarre. Ac-
cording to many students at the Uni-
versity, the policy just creates com-
plexity in terms of names and is more 
related to ?ction than reality. Now 
before you brainstorm over ‘?ction,’ 
the term here refers to the silly pro-
nouns that students are designating 
themselves with. Some of them are 
‘Your Majesty,’ ‘Your Highness,’ ‘The 
Greatest of All Time’ and ‘Unicorn’. 
The policy has totally turned into a 
fun game for students, hashtag UM-
pronounchallenge on Twitter.
My reaction? I am confused! Are 
these not the students who demand-
ed change in the ?rst place? Or is it 
that the real ones who demanded 
change never really got time to act or 
use the policy because of the hyped 
drama that swooped in? Nobody 
knows!
But there is indeed something 
that I know.
First, the university did their best 
to serve the rights of all genders. Liv-
ing in a nation that promotes gender 
equality, diversity, and inclusion, the 
best way in which one can contribute 
his part is by showing sincere efforts 
to the betterment of the society. 
The University of Michigan dif-
ferentiated itself from other educa-
tional institutions by accommodat-
ing gender inclusion in its policy. 
Restricting the pronoun selection 
to only a few words would have 
been similar to boxing and tagging 
the [gender queers] to the gender 
binary system.
Second, the students, rather than 
mocking and coming up with silly 
names, could have been a catalyst to 
the change by supporting the policy. 
The relationship between the Uni-
versity and its students is mutual. 
Each has to take care of the other 
and foster the relation. 
Playing around with names 
and pronouns will not 
help the society 
?ght for a 
better cause. 
Instead, re-
specting the 
University’s de-
cision by letting 
those in need en-
ter their own pro-
nouns would have 
been helpful. The 
students who did not 
need it should not have used it to 
goof up with their names. 
If you check Twitter’s #UM-
pronounchallenge page, 
you would hardly 
?nd a serious talk 
around the top-
ic. Students 
are teasing 
each other 
and enjoy-
ing the self-
proclaimed 
names.
Students 
have even 
confused the 
titles with the 
pronouns and 
in response to 
this, a professor 
at the Universi-
ty replied back 
saying, “Call me an old-fashioned 
former English teacher, but titles are 
not pronouns.”
The overall picture of the whole 
policy change is not very optimistic 
as it has turned into a mini-disaster. 
Let’s see how far this goes.
In 2015, The University of Ten-
nessee-Knoxville suggested the use 
of pronouns for gender inclusion 
such as “ze, xe, xem, xyr, zirs and 
hirs,” but the suggestion was taken 
away soon due to the amount of re-
sistance it suffered. Let us hope the 
that University of Michigan does not 
meet the same fate.
It is time to inspect our education 
system and make necessary reforms 
in the inclusion policy. As a nation 
that takes pride in diversity and in-
clusion, it becomes necessary to nur-
ture all genders and promote them 
at the very basic level, i.e. education. 
Surprisingly, corporations in our 
country have better statistics over 
gender-inclusion than educational 
institutions. Is this worth pondering? 
Gender inclusive-
ness needs attention 
from around the 
country because this 
conversation is just 
getting louder, not 
quieter.
SPEAK
YOUR
MIND.

Montreal pit bull ban demonizes dogs, violates animal rights
Choosing pronouns cannot be a joke
CASSIE SCANLON
Junior Staffwriter
This past Wednesday, a judge in 
Montreal struck down a ban on pit 
bulls. The ban would have halted 
the adoption of pit bulls, and re-
quired current pit bull owners to 
obtain a $150 permit and muzzle 
their dogs outdoors, even in their 
own back yards, and require them to 
keep their dogs on a four foot leash 
in public. The owners themselves 
would also have to undergo criminal 
background checks. This ban on pit 
bulls is a result of the stigmatization 
of these amazing dogs and a viola-
tion of animal rights.
While many today perceive pit 
bulls as aggressive, uncontrollable 
dogs, this assumption could not be 
further from the truth. In fact, from 
1900 until the 1980s, there was only 
one national news story that dealt 
with a pit bull attacking a human. 
This “attack” was man setting a 
pack of 26 dogs on a young woman. 
Many articles have arose in both 
the United States and Canada since 
the 1980s, but this has to do with 
the rise in dog ?ghting, and not pit 
bulls themselves.
In fact, the de?nition of pit bulls 
doesn’t de?ne a singular breed. 
Rather, it refers to the American Bull 
Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the Ameri-
can Staffordshire Terrier, and the 
Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The mis-
information on pit bulls doesn’t end 
here, it only begins. Many believe 
that pit bull aggression is genetic, 
but aggression in pit bulls is a prod-
uct of their environment.
Pit bulls do have a genetic compo-
sition to be more aggressive to other 
dog breeds, though not to humans, 
but this aggression can be curtailed 
with responsible dog ownership. Pit 
bulls prior to the ‘80s were known as 
a devoted, caring breed.
This exact reasoning is what led 
to the initial suspension of the ban. 
While the ban was in response to 
the tragic death of a 55-year-old 
woman who was mauled by a dog 
that ?rst responders described as a 
pit bull, it was rushed by legislators 
and clearly aimed speci?cally at pit 
bulls as a breed and not as the fac-
tors that turn dogs into dangers. The 
ban violates these animals’ rights, 
and treats them as monsters in-
stead of the loving animals that they 
actually are.
Instead of banning pit bulls, leg-
islators can focus their attention 
of advocating for responsible dog 
ownership. Pit bulls are far from be-
ing the only breed to show aggres-
sive behavior, and awareness for 
responsible dog ownership will be 
far more bene?cial than furthering 
the stigmatization of a loving, car-
ing dog breed.
favor of a popular vote for president. 
Because the NPVIC may not have 
the easiest path to success, I would 
like to propose a different poten-
tial change to our electoral system 
that does not often get discussed. 
My approach would enhance the 
way our democracy works with-
out having to pass a constitutional 
amendment: make the Electoral 
College proportional.
If each state awarded its electoral 
votes proportionally, we would see a 
much closer representation of how 
the country voted. Take, for exam-
ple, the 2012 election. Obama beat 
Romney badly in the Electoral Col-
lege — 332 to 206. While the elec-
toral vote percentage shows a 62 
percent to 38 percent rout, Obama 
beat Romney just 51.1 percent to 
47.2 percent in the popular vote.
Arthur Lieber, the Democratic 
nominee for Missouri’s 2nd Con-
gressional District, imagines a world 
in which all of the states award 
proportionally. Obama would have 
beaten Romney just 276–264, a 51 
percent to 49 percent margin that is 
far more representative of the actual 
margin of victory. It should be noted 
this hypothetical doesn’t account for 
third-party candidates, who could 
potentially also get electoral votes 
without having to be a spoiler party.
Still, this model is a clear mid-
dle ground. It doesn’t abolish the 
Electoral College, and it ensures the 
president will have more nationally-
based support. Candidates would 
no longer be able to focus solely on 
swing states. Republicans would 
be motivated to campaign in bluer 
states, and Democrats would be 
motivated to campaign in redder 
ones. Unfortunately, to achieve my 
reform, all 50 states would have to 
agree to this radical change. So we 
will continue to dream.
As we’re stuck with the current 
Electoral College for the foreseeable 
future, swing states will continue to 
wield outsized importance. And that 
brings us back to you, dear reader. 
No matter who you vote for, your 
vote matters a great deal more in 
Pennsylvania than in another state 
that is more secure for either major 
candidate. 
Unless you’re already registered 
in another swing state, I would 
heavily encourage you to register or 
re-register to vote here. Tomorrow, 
Oct. 11, is your last day to register, 
so you’d better get moving.
If you need motivation, check out 
Bush’s margin of victory in Florida 
in 2000. Out of almost six million 
votes cast, Bush defeated Gore by 
537. There are more people than 
that enrolled in the School of Com-
puter Science.

Water main tanks installed in the Mall to collect drainage
CHRIS SHENG
Junior Staffwriter
The storm water tanks 
installed under the Mall, 
which is the lawn located be-
tween Hamerschlag Hall and 
the College of Fine Arts lawn, 
aims to help reduce ?ooding in 
that area during severe storms 
by collecting storm water run-
off from existing downspouts 
and catch basins near Doherty, 
Wean, Baker, and Porter halls.
As reported in The Piper, 
an of?cial publication by the 
Internal Communications 
Department at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, this collection 
system is comprised of four 
concrete and waterproof sec-
tioned tanks; each of them be-
ing 80 feet in length, 16 feet in 
width, and 10 feet in height. 
Collectively, these tanks, 
which are 416 sq. meters in 
surface area, can store up 
to 275,000 gallons of water. 
The water collected can be 
reused for the campus chilled 
water cooling systems, and 
excess water will be diverted 
to the city storm water system 
which is situated downstream 
of campus buildings, which 
eventually drains into the Al-
legheny River, according to

The area of the Mall, which 
is low-lying, was severely 
?ooded during the major 
storms in 2004, 2009, and 
2011. The Mall Stormwater 
Management Project is a 
major sustainability effort the 
university has conducted to 
manage stormwater in a way 
that is constructive for both 
the campus and the city. A 
construction crew began ex-
cavating the Mall in early May 
and the site was completely 
restored in mid-August. The 
huge dig process, involving a 
550-ton crane, was completed 
in June.
According to Stormwater 
Report, because of its hilly 
terrain, generally poor soil 
quality, and growing land de-
velopment, stormwater man-
agement is one of the major 
concerns in southwestern 
Pennsylvania.
Generally, Pittsburgh faces 
a high ?ood risk throughout 
the year. 
Not only does this excess 
storm water log the mu-
nicipal systems and create 
health, economic, and envi-
ronmental challenges, it also 
violates the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s federal 
Clean Water Act. According 
to an article by Environment 
at CMU, the website for en-
vironment and sustainability 
efforts, Pittsburgh’s frequent 
rainfall as well as melting 
snow also causes this problem. 
The article states that “un-
treated sewage streams into 
waterways, over?ows from 
manholes or backs up into 
homeowners’ basements.” In

Human infant brain  ?exibility attributed to neuron movement
A human infant’s brain 
remains malleable for a few 
months after birth, and the 
mass migration of a large 
group of nerve cells may be 
the explanation.
Before birth, most of the 
brain’s nerve cells, called neu-
rons, move to the frontal lobe 
of the brain. As an infant in-
teracts with the world around 
them, the neurons react and 
link together, forming circuits 
that are malleable. This newly 
discovered mass migration of 
neurons may explain why the 
circuits remain so malleable 
within the ?rst few months.
“In the ?rst six months, 
that’s kind of [infants’] critical 
period when they slowly de-
velop their response to [their] 
environment. They start to en-
gage with emotions,” says Eric 
Huang, a neuropathologist at 
the University of California, 
San Francisco and co-author 
of the study. “Our results pro-
vide a cellular basis for postna-
tal human brain development 
and how cognition might be 
developed.”
When examining slices 
of postmortem infant brains 
under an electron micro-
scope, the researchers found 
a group of cells making mi-
gration proteins. To con?rm 
this, they tagged the cells with 
a virus containing a glow-
ing protein and observed the 
neurons’ migration through 
the brain. The research was 
published in Science.

Hurricane Matthew travels from Carribean to coastal U.S.
Hurricane Matthew, which 
began as a tropical cyclone 
and transformed into the ?rst 
Category 5 Atlantic hurricane 
since 2007, is now making its 
way up the southeast coast of 
the United States.
Hurricane Matthew origi-
nated on Sept. 22 from a tropi-
cal wave off Africa and devel-
oped into a tropical storm a 
week later. 
On Sept. 29, it became clas-
si?ed as a hurricane, reaching 
peak strength as a Category 5 
the next day. The hurricane 
made landfall in Haiti and 
Cuba on Oct. 4 as a Category 
4 hurricane.
 The storm has killed hun-
dreds of people in the Carib-
bean Islands, including Haiti, 
Jamaica, The Bahamas, Cuba, 
and Dominican Republic. 
Hurricane Matthew made 
landfall near Florida on Oct. 
7. So far, at least six people in 
Florida have died, with over 2 
million urged to evacuate.
The storm is currently mak-
ing landfall in South Carolina 
as a Category 1 hurricane after 
having passed through Florida 
and Georgia. 
Serious concerns include 
?ooding. “It’s not just about 
the beaches. It’s (also) inland 
where we can have loss of life,” 
said North Carolina Gov. Pat 
McCrory during a Saturday 
morning news conference.
As of Sunday morning, the 
death toll in North Carolina 
has risen to seven.

Gecko’s adhesive pads hold key to rapid evolution
Researchers lead by 
Timothy Higham, an associ-
ate professor of biology at 
the University of California, 
Riverside, have studied a spe-
cies of gecko that may explain 
where a gecko’s adhesive toe 
and ?nger pads evolved from.
The researchers were 
examining a genus of dwarf 
gecko when they came across 
Gonatodes humeralis in South 
America. They found that 
the gecko had microscopic 
hairs, called setae, under-
neath its toes, giving it the 
ability to cling to smooth sur-
faces, unlike other Gonatodes 
geckos that rely on complex 
toe structure.
“In the lab, this gecko can 
climb smooth vertical surfaces 
using its incipient adhesive 
system,” Higham said. 
This is made possible 
through the attractive van der 
Waals forces between the se-
tae and the surface. “The rela-
tively simple adhesive system 
of the G. humeralis is indica-
tive that slight modi?cations 
in form can dramatically in?u-
ence functional outcomes and 
the ecological niches that can 
be exploited.”
The research also indi-
cates that the adhesiveness 
of geckos occurred gradually, 
suggesting that subtle mor-
phological changes can result 
in rapid evolution. The results 
of the study were published 
in the Biological Journal of the 
Linnean Society.

Theory that ancient Earth warmed through methane incorrect
About a billion years ago, 
our sun was 10-15 percent 
dimmer than it is today — 
not enough to warm a planet 
for the microscopic bacteria 
developing in the ocean. At-
mospheric scientists believed 
it was the greenhouse gas 
methane, which traps heat 34 
times better than carbon di-
oxide, that kept enough heat 
trapped in the atmosphere to 
keep oceans liquid instead of 
freezing over.
However, a new model-
ing study from the Alterna-
tive Earths team of the NASA 
Astrobiology Institute has a 
different idea.
“A proper accounting of 
biogeochemical cycles in the 
oceans reveals that methane 
has a much more powerful foe 
than oxygen,” said Stephanie 
Olson, a member of the Alter-
native Earths team and lead 
author of the new study. “You 
can’t get signi?cant methane 
out of the ocean once there is 
sulfate.”
It is hypothesized that 
sulfate ?rst appeared after 
oxygen was introduced into 
the atmosphere, triggering 
oxidative weathering of rocks. 
Sulfate not only limits the pro-
duction of methane, but it also 
destroys it directly. 
Now scientists must revisit 
what gas could have the same 
effect.
The study was published in 
the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

New, prehistoric shark related to Megalodon found    
Scientists have discovered 
a new species of prehistoric 
shark that poses more ques-
tions than it answers in re-
gards to relating prehistoric 
sharks to modern ones. 
This shark is presumed to 
be over 20 million years old 
and believed to have grown 
12 feet in length, which is still 
smaller than our own great 
white shark.
The shark, called 
Megalolamna paradoxodon, is 
a descendent of Megalodon, 
an ancient shark that grew to 
around 60 feet. 
However, 45 million years 
separate the two, leaving a 
large gap of time in the fossil-
ization record. 
Scientists have found 
fossilized teeth of Paradox-
odon on the east and west 
coast of North America, the 
coast of Japan, and in South 
America. 
Although the fossilized 
teeth bare some resemblance 
to the teeth of modern sharks, 
such as the salmon shark, 
the relationship is unlikely.
Scientists have determined 
that Paradoxodon belongs to 
the Otodus genus of sharks. 
Megalodon had previously 
been classi?ed in the Carcha-
rocles genus, but this is the ?rst 
concrete evidence to suggest 
this might not be the case.
The ?ndings were 
published in the journal 
Historical Biology.

Facebook Messenger app gets encryption
One of Facebook’s 
distinguishing features is 
its private messaging app, 
Facebook Messenger. 
Recently, Facebook has 
introduced “Secret Conver-
sation” to all 900 million 
Facebook Messenger users.
Although messages were 
already secure, Secret Conver-
sation ensures that messages 
can be encrypted from one de-
vice to another, with not even 
Facebook or law enforcement 
and intelligence agencies 
monitoring them.
When a user ?rst receives 
an encrypted conversation on 
Facebook Messeger, a descrip-
tion states, “Your messages are 
already secure, but secret con-
versations are encrypted from 
one device to another. You can 
choose to make these mes-
sages disappear, and you can 
still report conversations even 
after a short time after the 
messages have disappeared.”
Facebook Messenger is 
only one of the most recent 
apps utilizing encryption to 
increase the security of mes-
sages while also mandating 
that the new layer of encryp-
tion must be mannually en-
abled for each conversation; 
others include WhatsApp and 
the Signal app.

HOW THINGS WORK
Precision ri?ery requires intense thoughtUndergraduate major relocated
NAVIYA SINGLA
Assistant SciTech Editor
Prospective students 
applying to the School of 
Computer Science for the  
Fall 2017 semester will now 
be able to select computa-
tional biology as a major. 
Previously under the 
jurisdiction of the Mellon 
College of Science, the com-
putational biology major 
complements the computa-
tional biology department’s 
master’s and Ph.D. programs.
According to the 
university news report that 
announced the introduc-
tion of this major, the rede-
signed curriculum aims to 
provide students with strong 
foundations in the natural 
sciences and highlight cer-
tain features of computer 
science that are relevant to 
biological studies. 
Given the growth in the 
biotechnological and phar-
maceutical industries, along 
with the increasing demand 
for professionals that can 
better apply computational 
approaches to problems in 
the natural sciences, this new 
curriculum aims to prepare 
students for those lucrative, 
in-demand positions.
The curriculum entails 
four subject cores: math/
statistics, biology, computer 
science, and computational 
biology. 
It has a signi?cant overlap 
with a typical pre-med cur-
riculum, which allows stu-
dents to venture into health-
care professions as well as 
biomedical research. 
Furthermore, this major 
allows students to choose to 
obtain a Ph.D. in computa-
tional biology to deal with 
higher-order questions faster 
than they would with only a 
computer science degree or 
only a degree in biology. 
The students will be 
exposed to techniques in 
problem solving such as 
machine learning, data 
analysis, and computational 
modeling, as well as to the 
biological foundations.
The aim of this program, 
according to Robert F. 
Murphy, head of the compu-
tational biology department, 
is to “provide a curriculum 
designed to train students to 
tackle the biomedical prob-
lems of the next century 
through rigorous training in 
both computer science and 
biology.”
He said, “The program 
provides a path for students 
interested in biology to 
pursue it within one of the 
leading computer science 
institutions in the world. An 
important goal in designing 
the curriculum was to retain 
the outstanding grounding in 
computer science associated 
with the [computer science] 
major while making room for 
additional coursework.”
Phillip Compeau, an 
assistant teaching professor 
in the computational biol-
ogy department will be the 
Program Director for the 
incoming computational 
biology majors next fall.
Quoted in a news report 
by the computational biol-
ogy department, Andrew 
Moore, the Dean of the 
School of Computer Science, 
said “Computer science in-
creasingly is driving the re-
search agendas in any num-
ber of disciplines, including 
biomedical research. That’s 
why it’s especially important 
for a degree program in 
computational biology to be 
within our school, providing

“But, if you make it to 
the Junior Olympics for 
ri?ery there’s an all-you-
can-eat ice cream bar at the 
training center.”
I’ve been around the sport 
of precision ri?ery since the 
age of ten, when my sister ?rst 
convinced me to join the sport 
in pursuit of the all-you-can-
eat ice cream bar found at the 
Olympic Training Center in 
Colorado Springs, Colorado.
When the words ri?e, 
gun, and shooting are heard 
together more often than 
not they are associated with 
negative images — I’d like 
to explain how the sport of 
precision ri?ery actually 
works.
Precision ri?ery is a sport 
that is run on a national 
scale by organizations like 
USA Shooting (the governing 
Olympic organization in the 
United States) and the Nation-
al Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion in every state of the United 
States — these organizations 
help run matches for junior 
and collegiate competitors all 
the way through senior level 
members. 
Disciplines differ for com-
petitors, though, as one can 
compete in air ri?e or small-
bore ri?e.
On a junior member level, 
participants compete in year-
round matches that culminate 
in the Junior Olympic Region-
al Competitions in December. 
If shooters do well they can go 
to the Junior Olympics. 
Frequently in the sport, 
collegiate-age contenders 
move on to the Olympics 
through quali?cations. 
This year the United States 
sent fourteen people to the 
Olympics for air gun, small-
bore, and shotgun. 
In particular, 19-year-old 
Virginia Thrasher, a ?rst-year 
at West Virginia University, 
won gold in air ri?e.
Standard indoor precision 
ri?ery matches for juniors 
consist of using .22 caliber 
long barrel ri?es to shoot at 
targets 50 feet away. 
Competitors stand 
behind a desig-
nated ?ring 
line where 
a match 
director 
(referee) 
dictates 
timing 
and posi-
tion for the 
match. 
There are three positions in 
the sport: prone, standing, 
and kneeling.
In prone position the 
competitor lays on a mat on 
the ground, on their elbows 
and has the ri?e attached us-
ing a sling to his upper arm. 
In standing position, the 
competitor is upright and at 
a right angle to the ?ring line 
and holds the gun at shoulder 
height. 
In kneeling position, the 
competitor sits on one ankle 
and props the other knee up, 
using it to 
support 
the 
weight of the ri?e as it points 
down range. 
Additionally, a sitting po-
sition may be added during 
particular outdoor matches or 
unique indoor matches.
In a basic three-position 
match each competitor shoots 
prone, standing, and kneel-
ing once for twenty shots and 
then changes position. Varia-
tions of the positions can oc-
cur, though. For example, 
long outdoor prone matches 
are very common among new 
shooters as well as popular 
among seniors. 
On the Olympic level, the 
gold medal winner scores in 
the upper 590 range to win 
overall. This year, Thrasher 
scored a 599 out of 600, 
winning gold for America.
“What’s most attractive of 
ri?e is the mental side of the 
sport,” said Thrasher in an 
NBC Olympics article. “Any-
one can go and hit a 10, it’s 
not that hard. To go and shoot 
10 after 10 after 10 in a big 
event is very hard. You have 
to have a mastery of the 
mental side, controlling 
your emotions, follow-
ing your process and 
not thinking of the 
outcome.”
Equipment for the 
sport is also very im-
portant. Participants 
wear heavy, stiff 
suits that restrict 
motion because 
when concentrat-
ing on a target 50 
feet away, limiting 
movement is the key 
to accuracy. With a 
center of the bullseye 
the size of a period in 
12-point font, everything 
counts. Additionally, spe-
cialized hats, gloves, and 
shooting shoes are worn. 
Some athletes learn to 
slow their heart rates down 
the point where they can take 
shots in between beats so that 
when looking through their 
sites their heart rate does 
not make their site picture 
change.
Precision ri?ery is a sport 
that requires intense concen-
tration and training, but is 
professionally recognized on a 
global scale.

Electronic voting machines are vulnerable to hackers
fact, stormwater runoff is the 
United States’ most common 
cause of water pollution.
According to Environment 
at CMU, Carnegie Mellon 
University has suffered mil-
lions of dollars from damage 
caused by stormwater in the 
recent years, and has adopted 
many practices to prevent 
stormwater damage. 
For instance, the Purnell 
Center has a 10,000-gallon 
stormwater cistern installed 
on the roof to slow down the 
?ow of storm water. 
In the Gates Hill-
man Complex, there is a 
10,000-gallon tank that col-
lects rain water and supplies 
the water for toilets. 
In the Morewood Gardens 
parking lot, there is a dry well 
installed for run-off that emp-
ties into a vegetative swale 
and a concrete dam. 
The Cohon Center has a 
6,000-gallon water collection 
tank that is used for ?ushing 
toilets and for irrigation. 
In addition, Carnegie 
Mellon University has many 
buildings with Green Roofs, 
which refers to roofs that are 
living or vegetated.
According to Facilities 
Management Services and 
Campus Design and Facility 
Development, the storm wa-
ter tanks installed under the 
Mall have the capacity to store 
rain from a 500-year event 
with empty tanks. 
As of the beginning of 
the semester, the project has 
been completed and moves 
the campus closer to the idea 
of sustainability, reusing the 
resources already around us.

In April, Donald Trump 
suggested that the election 
might be rigged in favor of his 
opponent — Hillary Clinton. 
Surroundng this scare were 
reports of Russians hacking, 
albeit unsuccessfully, into 
Arizona and Illinois’ voter 
registration systems. 
While most of these 
claims are just hearsay, it is 
important to consider the 
security of the data of the 
voting process especially 
now, that we are moving to 
electronic systems. 
Most of the problems 
surrounding electronic 
voting machines are the 
problems surrounding any 
electronic machine such as 
password-guessing, equip-
ment malfunction, soft-
ware errors and machine 
tampering to name a few. 
Current voting system 
machines use Windows XP 
or older, for which Microsoft 
hasn’t released a security 
patch availible to the public 
since early 2014. Not only is 
this a usability issue, this is 
also a security problem. 
Hackers with malicious 
intent can easily break into 
an outdated system and tam-
per with the data, and hence 
the votes. 
Also, machines that are 
connected using a Wi-Fi net-
work could be accessed with-
out authorization by tapping 
into the communication 
channel. This method is quite 
similar to riding on public 
Wi-Fi to hack the computers 
connected to it. 
Another method, as 
mentioned in a report by 
CNN Money, is to acquire the 
voter access card that some 
machines use to identify the 
voter and tamper with that. 
In a demonstration by 
Symantec to CNN Money, 
a small, portable machine 
was used to hack into and 
physically reprogram the 
card, to allow it to cast mul-
tiple votes or votes of only 
one kind. 
Besides tampering with 
votes, malicious hackers can 
in?uence the election process 
by deleting, changing or add-
ing voter records, cyber bul-
lying employees setting up 
the election and modifying 
data on campaign websites. 
Furthermore, the lack of 
recounts that are actually 
meaningful and can reassure 
the public of the counting 
process the way recounting 
paper ballots does, in the 
case of doubts is also a con-
cern while making a switch to 
electronic voting machines. 
Thus, though switching to 
electronic voting machines 
is a change for the best, it 
brings its own set of prob-
lems, which is why it is im-
portant to pass safety regu-
lations and place electronic 
voting machines in the cate-
gory of critical infrastructure 
that includes banks, power 
grids, hospitals etc. 
New policies that enforce 
strict security parameters 
will help reinstate public 
faith in the election system.

Week 4 of The Tartan fantasy football league gets heated
SINEAD FOLEY
Forum Editor
From the moment I was 
asked to join The Tartan’s 
?rst Fantasy Football league 
I made no pretenses about 
knowing what the heck was 
going on. My leaguemates said 
they needed one more person 
to make the league work, so 
I ?gured I’d make a team to 
help them out and then leave 
it to run by itself, accepting 
my losses with grace and a 
healthy side of not caring. And 
considering that when I went 
to make my team I couldn’t 
?gure out how to do it and 
accidently ended up making 
two, keeping a safe distance 
seemed like the way to go.
For a bit there the plan 
seemed to be working. My 
auto-picked, automatically 
named Teams Foley held their 
own, averaging around 100 
points a week for the ?rst 
three rounds. Then disaster 
struck in week three. Turns 
out you have to actually man-
age and change your teams in 
this game. Starting at a score-
board where my team had 45 
points less than the second 
worst loser, I decided it was 
time to make a change.
Our beloved Layout Manag-
er Zeke Rosenberg and Assis-
tant Sports Editor Ian Tanaya 
took it upon themselves to 
help me on my quest of ?gur-
ing out what in the world was 
going on. The ?rst step was 
teaching me that there is a site 
where we can actually view 
and control our teams. Imag-
ine! Then it was time to take it 
to the next level and teach me 
how to move people on and 
off the bench. There are a lot 
of letters that I’m still trying 
to decipher, but it seems that 
you want to bench people who 
have red letters next to them 
and replace them with some-
one in the same position.
I was starting to feel pretty 
con?dent that I could manage 
this team and quickly scale 
the league scoreboard until 
Rosenberg said, “You’re also 
going to want to bench Tevin 
Coleman too. He has sickle cell 
anemia and the Falcons are 
playing in Denver this week.” 
My reaction was, “Wait, how 
am I supposed to know any of 
that.” In that moment, I gave 
up any hope of ?guring this 
game out.
There was, however, one 
thing I could do to improve 
my situation in the league. At 
the very least, I could change 
my team’s names to be more 
re?ective of the situation. And 
so teams ‘What is going on?’ 
and ‘How does this work?’ 
were born. And while I have 
faith that we’ll do better next 
week with a bit of help from 
our friends (cough, Rosen-
berg, cough), I still have to 
pay my dues and report on our 
epic demise last week. And so, 
without further ado, here’s the 
weekly report.
Plaidie Daddies over Dream-
land Warriors 107–104
Our Online Editor India 
Price had a narrow victory 
over Tanaya’s Warriors. The 
two teams were a fairly even 
match, with over half of each 
team scoring in the double 
digits. Tayana saw some great 
play from  his running backs 
LeSean McCoy of the Bills 
and Jordan Howard from the 
Bears, who earned 22 and 16 
points respectively. In the end 
it didn’t matter, though, be-
cause Bengals wide receiver 
A.J. Green earned Price a 
crushing 33 points. Apparent-
ly Green has been a bit of a su-
perstar this season, or so ESPN 
sports tells me. All I know is 
that between his points and 
a beautiful supporting act by 
Price’s other wide receiver, 
Broncos’ Emmanuel Sand-
ers, there was really nothing 
Tanaya could do, but his War-
riors fought hard anyway and 
Tanaya will have to try again.
extremely dank team over 
Masshole Knickerbockers 
137–110
Both of these teams put 
their best foot forward this 
week. Sports Editor Alex 
Wood’s team crushed it, with 
all of his players scoring in 
double digits. High ?yers in-
cluded Ravens wide receiver 
Steve Smith Sr., who pulled off 
an impressive 25 points and 
became the ?rst player aged 
37 or older with 100 receiving 
yards and a touchdown since 
Ricky Proehl in 2005, which 
was apparently a big deal or 
something, and Saints’ run-
ning back Mark Ingram, who 
earned Wood 21 points. Beres-
ford made great use of her 
team this week, losing very 
few points on the bench, but 
again luck was not in her favor.
Minaj and Co. over Mr. Rod-
gers’ Neighborhood 163–112
Now for the big scorer of 
the week. Pillbox Editor Ab-
hishek Tayal had an admitted-
ly impressive performance this 
week, and no one will let me 
forget it. As people keep men-
tioning, his wide receiver Julio 
Jones singlehandedly tied one 
of my whole teams with 48 
points. Jones made history in 
our league for the most points 
scored by a single player and 
out in the real world by becom-
ing the sixth player in history 
to record at least 300 receiving 
yards in a single contest. Cour-
tesy of Wood, I ?nally know 
what that means. Just because 
the deities of fantasy football 
like to be unfair, Tayal also 
had Steelers quarterback Ben 
Roethlisberger, who scored 34 
points. I was getting an angry 
rant all prepared until I saw 
that he was a Steelers player, 
so I guess I’ll let it go since he’s 
one of our boys. The most frus-
trating part is that Tayal didn’t 
even max out his potential, 
losing 15 points by benching 
running back Isaiah Crowell of 
the Browns in favor of Chiefs’ 
running back Spencer Ware, 
who earned a limp 8 points. 
In the face of this onslaught, 
Operations Manager Jade 
Crockem didn’t really stand 
a chance. Still, she raked up 
a respectable 112 points with 
the help of quarterback Derek 
Carr of the Raiders, Cowboys 
running back Ezekiel Elliot, 
and Broncos wide receiver De-
maryius Thomas. Rumor has it 
that Elliot could end up being 
rookie of the year if he keeps 
up his pace.
Flaming Bears over McMa-
nus’s Anus 113–94
And now we have Rosen-
berg facing off against Pub-
lisher Sarah Gutekunst. These 
two get the award for losing 
the most points on the bench 
this week, which I’m a little 
bit pleased about since I as-
sumed I’d be the one with that 
distinction. Rosenberg wasted 
the second highest scorer of 
the week, quarterback Matt 
Ryan of the Falcons, favoring 
the Redskins’ Kirk Cousins’ 
measly 17 points to Ryan’s 
35. Gutekunst made her own 
blunders, leaving her top two 
scorers, Seahawk quarterback 
Russell Wilson and Raider 
wide receiver Michael Crab-
tree, on the bench. These 
aren’t the kinds of perfor-
mances I’ve come to expect 
from football guru Gutekunst 
and my mentor Rosenberg. 
Hopefully they will both refo-
cus in the coming weeks.
How does this work? over 
What is going on? 93–48
And, last and least, we get 
to my mess of a match up. I’d 
say that there should be rules 
against having to battle your-
self, but I’m pretty sure there 
are rules against having two 
teams in the ?rst place. My 
complete lack of commitment 
to this league ?nally caught up 
to me this week. To be fair the 
meager performance of How 
does this work? wasn’t com-
pletely my fault since all but 
one of my players never broke 
15 points, but I lost 24 points 
through pure neglect when I 
didn’t substitute in wide re-
ceiver John Brown of the Car-
dinals for Bills wide receiver 
Sammy Watkins when he end-
ed up on injury reserve at the 
start of the week due to a foot 
injury. I really don’t have any-
thing to say about What is go-
ing on? With two of my play-
ers out with injuries and wide 
receiver DeAndre Hopkins of 
the Texans only managing to 
eek out one point in the whole 
week, it was an absolute mess. 
But never fear! I’ve taken a 
peek at the coming week’s 
scoreboard and, spoiler alert, 
I’m doing quite a bit better.

NFL viewership declines as a result of Goodell’s mishaps
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
Five weeks have passed 
in the 2016 NFL season, and 
some are suggesting that the 
fall of professional football 
is imminent. Concerns ?rst 
rose when the season open-
ing game between the Den-
ver Broncos and the Carolina 
Panthers drew in 8 percent 
fewer viewers than last year’s 
showdown between the New 
England Patriots and the Pitts-
burgh Steelers and 6 percent 
fewer viewers than 2014’s 
opener between the Seattle 
Seahawks and the Green Bay 
Packers. Viewership ?gures 
did not improve. Throughout 
the ?rst four weeks of the sea-
son, overall viewership was 
down 11 percent, and viewer-
ship among 18 to 49 year old 
people declined by 12 percent.
The NFL itself is appar-
ently unconcerned by these 
numbers. “While our partners, 
like us, would have liked to see 
higher ratings, they remain 
con?dent in the NFL and un-
concerned about a long-term 
issue,” NFL senior executives 
Brian Rolapp and Howard 
Katz said in a memo to team 
owners. They noted that over 
the last 15 years, ratings view-
ership has grown 27 percent 
and that football “continues to 
be far and away the most pow-
erful programming on tele-
vision and the best place for 
brands and advertisers.”
Rolapp and Katz attributed 
the decline in viewership to 
the “unprecedented interest 
in the Presidential election.” 
They pointed to a decline dur-
ing the 2000 election between 
Republican nominee George 
W. Bush and Democratic nom-
inee Al Gore as precedence for 
an election that drew away 
viewers from the NFL. Indeed, 
it does appear that this year’s 
contest between Democratic 
nominee Hillary Clinton and 
Republican nominee Donald 
Trump has garnered substan-
tial attention among American 
TV viewers. Though Trump 
has protested the time of the 
?rst presidential debate for co-
inciding with a Monday Night 
Football game between the At-
lanta Falcons and the New Or-
leans Saints, the ?rst presiden-
tial debate drew in 84 million 
viewers, surpassing the previ-
ous 80.6 million viewer record 
from the 1980 debate between 
Republican nominee Ronald 
Reagan and Democratic nomi-
nee Jimmy Carter.
Evidently, the intensity of 
the current presidential elec-
tion does explain some of the 
NFL’s viewership woes, but 
other trends seem to have 
some speculating whether or 
not this decline in viewership 
will be reversed. Some have 
cited the NFL’s uneven allow-
ance of expression as a reason 
why some fans have stopped 
watching football games. San 
Francisco 49ers quarterback 
Colin Kaepernick stands out 
among players protesting the 
National Anthem in support of 
the Black Lives Matter move-
ment. The league itself seems 
to believe this is a good thing, 
claiming “that the perception 
of the NFL and its players is 
actually up in 2016.”
This may be true among 
the public at large; however, 
critics have been angered at 
the apparent approval of this 
show of support for a political 
movement while the league 
forbade the Dallas Cowboys 
from wearing a decal in sup-
port of the Dallas police 
department and law of?cers.
The league gave a good rea-
son for this decision. “There 
are so many wonderful, won-
derful causes, the league has 
to be careful,” NFL executive 
vice president Stephen Jones 
said when he had been asked 
about the possibility of the 
Cowboys wearing the decal in 
games. “If you allow one, then 
what do you do about every 
team that has a great reason 
to have something on their 
helmets?” Nevertheless, there 
is a considerable number of 
people who view the NFL as 
taking sides in a political mat-
ter, and these people may be 
protesting by denying the NFL 
the viewership it needs to keep 
advertisers happy.
The two points of potential 
controversy I wrote about in 
an article from Jan. 24 remain 
sticking points for the NFL. 
NFL Commissioner Roger 
Goodell’s handling of the De-
?ategate scandal stemming 
from the 2014 AFC Champion-
ship Game between the India-
napolis Colts and the Patriots 
has led many to question the 
fairness of the league’s dis-
ciplinary actions and appeal 
system. Though the NFL Game 
Operations Manual stipulated 
that altering the in?ation of 
a football outside of regula-
tions would incur a $25,000 
?ne, Goodell chose to make 
an example of the Patriots by 
suspending quarterback Tom 
Brady for four games, strip-
ping the team of two draft 
picks, and ?ning the team $1 
million. Though Goodell ?-
nally won at the U.S. Court of 
Appeals and Brady decided to 
serve his suspension, the dam-
age has already been done to 
the credibility of the commis-
sioner. In making a mountain 
out of a molehill and rejecting 
many scientists’ views regard-
ing the matter, Goodell has 
turned off many who feel like 
drama off the ?eld may make 
as much of an impact as the 
players on the ?eld.
Further adding to the 
league’s viewership dilemma 
is the impact that player safety 
has had on rule changes and 
public perception. During the 
offseason, the NFL adjusted 
the starting point for drives 
after a touchback on a kickoff 
or punt from the 20-yard line 
to the 25-yard line. In an ef-
fort to minimize the possibility 
of injury during kickoffs and 
punts, the NFL may have only 
drawn the ire of fans who be-
lieve NFL leadership is chang-
ing the nature of the game 
away from being a contact 
sport. For those fans who want 
to see action, alternatives like 
hockey become more appeal-
ing, drawing viewership away 
from football. Furthermore, 
such a move really doesn’t do 
much to address the reality of 
player safety concerns; it may 
in fact give the aura to those 
concerned by the violence that 
the league is only paying lip 
service to this critical issue, 
negatively impacting the 
reputation of the league.
It’s still too early to tell 
whether this dip in viewership 
is a temporary result of the 
election cycle or a fundamen-
tal shift in viewership taste. 
As many statisticians would 
surmise, the small sample 
size of four weeks of football 
is not enough to draw any 
meaningful conclusions re-
garding the state of the game. 
Although it is hard to tell right 
now, it is worth monitoring to 
see whether or not football’s 
status as the top sport in the 
United States will change.
Men’s soccer travels for win,remains unbeaten at home
Tartan men’s cross country sweeps invitational at home
ALEX WOOD

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team picked 
up two wins over the past 
week, improving their record 
to 9–1–1 on the year as they 
continue to steamroll oppo-
nents. The Tartans are still 
undefeated at home this sea-
son, and they demonstrated 
why against the University of 
Pittsburgh at Greensburg on 
Tuesday evening.
Tuesday’s match got off to 
a quick start, and both teams 
came ready to play. The Tar-
tans began the action with a 
shot on goal in ?rst minute 
of the game, and although 
it sailed high of the goal, the 
Tartans had made a state-
ment that they brought their 
A-game. Carnegie Mellon 
controlled the pace of the 
game during the ?rst half, 
but the Bobcats did not stop 
?ghting for the win. They had 
a few shots on goal of their 
own in the ?rst half, but none 
could ?nd the back of the 
net. The case was the same 
for the Tartans until the 38th 
minute when they got a free 
kick opportunity. Sophomore 
Anthony Gulli sent the free 
kick into the ?eld, and it went 
straight to the center of the 
goal. As the ball neared the 
players, sophomore Michael 
Lin jumped in front of the 
pack and launched a quick 
shot over the opposing keep-
er’s head to put the Tartans up 
1–0. The score would remain 
that way until later in the sec-
ond half.
Gulli decided he wanted to 
be a part of both Tartan goals 
this game, and in the 71st 
minute he made it a reality. 
With a defender trailing close 
behind him, Gulli ran down a 
loose ball and made a quick 
touch pass to sophomore Zack 
Masciopinto. Masciopinto re-
ceived the pass and instantly 
sent it to the goal. The ball 
?ew into the back of the net, 
and Masciopinto’s ?fth goal 
of the season gave the Tartans 
a comfortable 2–0 lead. That 
was the nail in the cof?n for 
the Bobcats, but they didn’t 
give up completely. In the 
very last second of the game, 
a Bobcat player made a des-
perate attempt to break the 
shutout and was successful. 
Unfortunately for them, the 
Bobcats were out of time and 
the Tartans were victorious.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
traveled to New York Univer-
sity for University Athletic 
Association (UAA) play. The 
Tartans decisively defeated 
the host Violets by a score of 
3–0, improving their record in 
UAA play to 1–0–1.
This game was unique in 
that all three scores came 
within four minutes of each 
other early in the second half. 
The game was a slow back 
and forth for the ?rst half, 
but the action exploded right 
as the teams came out for the 
second half. At the very end 
of the 55th minute, Masci-
opinto jumped out in front 
of a large group of players 
?ghting for the ball in front 
of the goal and sent it to the 
back of the net. The shot was 
too quick and too close to the 
net for the keeper to save, and 
the Tartans took a one-point 
lead. Masciopinto must have 
had a trick up his sleeve for 
this game, because he scored 
another goal 46 seconds after 
his ?rst. Sophomore Philip 
Petrakian sent a pass across 
the front of the net and Mas-
ciopinto headed it to the back 
of the net, giving the Tartans 
a 2–0 lead in under a minute.
The Tartans refused to 
slow down, and continued 
to put shots on goal with a 
relentless offensive attack. 
The Violet goalkeeper made 
eight saves in the match, but 
it still wasn’t enough to hold 
the Tartans down. In the 59th 
minute, Petrakian took a shot 
that was saved the Violet 
goalkeeper, but it rebounded 
straight to junior Ryan Stine-
baugh and he returned it to 
the net, this time succeeding 
and putting the Tartans up 
3–0 with the ?nal score of the 
game. Sophomore goalkeeper 
Alec Lam made two crucial 
saves in the waning minutes 
of the second half to hold 
onto the shutout and earn his 
fourth win in the net this sea-
son for the Tartans.
The Tartans go on the road 
again next week to take on 
the University of Rochester in 
another UAA competition on 
Friday, Oct. 14. The game is 
scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. 
in Rochester, New York.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
cross country team hosted 
their home invitational in 
Schenley Park on Saturday, 
and won the 8k race for the 
?fth straight year.
An unassociated runner 
crossed the ?nish line ?rst, 
but the Tartan runners were 
the ?rst of the NCAA af?liated 
runners to cross. The ?rst run-
ner to cross the line for the Tar-
tans is also one of the youngest 
on the team: ?rst-year Josh 
Kalapos ?nished the race in 
26:48.7. His teammate, junior 
Jordan Safer, fell behind just 
before the end of the race and 
ended up taking second with a 
time of 26:48.9.
The young runners for the 
Tartans showed up big in this 
race, as the third runner to ?n-
ish for the Tartans, ?rst-year 
Evan Yukevich, also took third 
place with a time of 26:52.4. 
As the runners continued to 
coast past the ?nish line, Carn-
egie Mellon jerseys were the 
only colors in sight. The fourth 
place runner in the race was 
also from Carnegie Mellon, 
and its no surprise that it was 
another ?rst-year student. Ste-
phen Law took the fourth place 
spot with a time of 26:9.6.
Sophomore Kevin Cory 
rounded out the top ?nish-
ers for the Tartans in the 
?fth place spot with a time of 
27:03.0 and he ensured the 
Tartans held all of the ?rst ?ve 
places. First-year Liam Walsh 
wasn’t far behind though, and 
he ?nished eighth overall with 
a time of 27:19.6. Senior Ste-
ven Kool was the ?nal Tartan 
to ?nish the race in the top ten 
with a time of 27:25.5.
One thing is for sure, when 
the Tartans run on their home 
turf they always dominate the 
competition. The Tartan run-
ners should be proud after 
placing seven runners in the 
top ten, and they’ll look to im-
prove on that in the next meet 
on Saturday, October 15 at the 
Inter-Regional Rumble hosted 
by Oberlin College.

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
about reconciling doughnut preferences and political views
Dear Sarah,
All of my life doughnuts have been a part of my 
identity. Not only is fried dough a delight for the 
senses and the heart alike, it’s also part of my 
geographical heritage.
I’m from Pennsylvania Dutch territory, and when 
the rest of the country is celebrating Mardi Gras 
with King Cake and beads, we gluttons stay busy 
stuffing our faces with fastnachts, or doughnuts 
fried in lard. A true German treat. The tradition 
goes that before the joy-sucking sadness of Lent, 
families would make these doughnuts on steroids 
in order to clean out the stock of lard and sugar. 
In my lifetime, however, Fastnacht day has always 
just been an excuse to indulge in another local 
institution: Maple Donuts.
I can’t even remember all the family and church 
gatherings I’ve attended to that have been flanked 
by Maple Donuts, sheathed in a crackly layer of 
sweet powdered sugar glaze, or filled to the gills 
with a tart seasonal jam. They also have excellent 
deals on day-olds that cannot be beat for a late-
night craving.
So imagine my horror when, home for the 
summer, I begin to see Maple billboards cropping 
up with some dipshit Trump lookalike screaming 
“You’re NOT fired, you brought Maple Donuts!” 
I thought maybe it was a silly joke. But no, in 
reality, the man who founded this seemingly-
perfect enterprise is genuinely a very dedicated 
Trump supporter.
This has completely marred my relationship with 
the fried delicacies I once held so dear to my 
general midsection. I look at a doughnut, and all I 
can see is a glazed pile of poop. This time, Trump 
has gone too far.I don’t know how to reconcile 
such a deep inner-conflict. Please guide me, oh 
hungry one.
Dried Out Ugly Guy Has Negated Our 
Tremendous Sweets
Dear DOUGHNOTS,
This is indeed a very unfortunate spot that Maple 
has put you in. It breaks my heart to hear that 
a memory so good and pure should be drug 
through the mud in service of a businessman’s 
personal interests, but that could be my 
catchphrase these days.I think that, unfortunately, 
you can never go back to Maple Donuts. That 
man does not deserve a penny of your money, 
even if he makes a damn good doughnut. But that 
doesn’t mean you have to stop eating doughnuts 
all together.
Take, for instance, Peace, Love & Little Donuts. The 
owner of one of the franchise locations openly 
holds very offensive views about homosexuals, 
which seems a little counter-intuitive to his theme of 
peace and love. But just as it is his first amendment 
right to express those beliefs on his personal social 
media accounts and blogs, it is your right to spend 
your dollar at the location in Oakland.
There may be no equivalent of Maple Donuts in 
your hometown, but hey, Dunkin Donuts isn’t that 
bad, and they keep their nose out of politics. You 
may be eating a worse doughnut, but at least it 
doesn’t benefit an openly terrible person.
This election season we’ve all had to emotionally 
break up with Trump supporters that we thought 
we loved: Aaron Carter, Hulk Hogan, Teresa 
Guidice, and even Peter Thiel. Cool people that 
used to be cool. But now we must shun them to 
make them feel the full consequences of their 
choices.
Sacrifice your doughnuts, not your principles.

India Price | Online Editorhalloween costumes
find out the best costumes for you this season 
Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. I don’t 
feel pressured into buying the best Christmas gifts 
during Secret Santa and I don’t have to explain 
to my Aunt Whatever-Her-Name-Is at Thanksgiving 
dinner why I don’t have a boyfriend. It’s just a 
time where you can dress up with your friends and 
buy a ton of really cheap candy on Nov. 1. Now 
I know what you’re thinking. “Woah. Halloween? 
It’s like Oct. 10?” I get it, it’s early for Halloween 
advice. But this is Carnegie Mellon, remember? 
You close your eyes for two minutes and all of a 
sudden you’ve got an exam to study for and two 
diseases to cure by noon. So it’s never too early 
to start planning. Plus, Target is already selling 
pumpkin-shaped candy corn, which officially 
ushers in the Halloween season. So without further 
ado, here are my Halloween 2016 costume tips.
Ditch the Store-Bought Costumes
If you haven’t already, it’s time to ditch the 
store-bought costumes. These costumes are 
cheaply made yet stupidly expensive. Plus, there 
are going to be hundreds of scream masks and 
pirate costumes, and nobody wants to run into 
themselves at a party. You don’t need fancy 
sewing skills and you really don’t even need to be 
crafty. There are plenty of tutorials online. Give it 
a try!
Think Outside the Box
There have already been a million and one 
superman costumes. The world has seen enough. 
And I know, Hotline Bling was great, but we’ve 
seen enough Drakes too. Get creative and think 
of something new! It’s time to step your game 
up, people. I’m always the most impressed by 
costumes that I never thought of myself!
Wear a Costume, Not a Culture
While frantically searching for the perfect costume 
this year, it’s going to be easy to get caught up in 
trying to imitate someone. But let’s circumvent any 
tragically-portrayed Native American “costumes.” 
And definitely try to avoid any “Sexy Geishas” or 
“Sexy Gypsies.” It’s best to dress up in a costume, 
not a culture. Trust me on this one.
Avoid Clowns
A solid go-to costume is usually a clown or, for 
those who prefer scarier options, killer clowns. 
But after the mass amounts of yet-to-be-explained 
clown sightings, it might be best to steer clear of 
clowns this Halloween. Unless you want to be 
Ronald McDonald, in which case I personally 
approve.
Coordinate with Your Friends
If you’re having trouble coming up with a solo 
costume, grab your best friend and coordinate 
outfits! The number of two person costume 
options are literally endless. Think of all the iconic 
duos out there: Ash and Pikachu, Popeye and 
Olive, Bacon and Eggs, or my personal favorite, 
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The list goes on 
and on. And this is arguably the perfect time to 
nail one last Brangelina costume. Once you get a 
group together, your costume possibilities increase 
dramatically, so coordinate with your entire 
squad! A sure-fire group costume idea is dressing 
up as the cast of your favorite movie or TV show 
(cough, cough, Bob’s Burgers). But feel free to get 
creative — I once saw a group of friends dress up 
as Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde, and chase their 
PacMan friend around.
Oh, I almost forgot. No minions. And limit one 
Harley Quinn costume per friend group.

---------------------------------------------------

Musician, composer, and singer, Björk has the 
art world around her inger. You’ve probably 
seen the infamous swan dress she wore to 
the Academy Awards in 2001, or heard the 
rumor that Iceland gave her a private island 
to thank her for her cultural contributions. Her 
path to stardom started at the humble age of 
12. In an interview with the Polar Music Prize, 
Björk described the routine of her 30-minute 
walk to school through the winding hills of 
Iceland, singing all the way. Björk was also the 
frontwoman for celebrated Icelandic punk band 
The Sugarcubes, before embarking as a solo 
artist in 1992.
In tandem with her ninth album released in 2015, 
the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) produced 
a retrospective of Björk’s work, addressing a 
question never explored at this scale: “how 
do you put music on the walls of a museum?” 
The MoMA turned to Björk’s archive of ilm, 
costumes, visuals, and objects to ill the galleries. 
Collaborating with directors Michel Gondry and 
Spike Jonze, and designers like Iris van Herpen, 
each of Björk’s music videos functions as a 
diorama, pulling you deeper into the world she 
shapes through her lyrics. Interested in pushing 
the relationship between music, visuals, and 
technology even further, MoMA commissioned 
two music videos from Vulnicura directed by 
Andrew Thomas Huang of Black Lake. 
Perhaps the most haunting and vulnerable 
song on the album is “Stonemilker,” shot in 
360-degree virtual reality. Vulnicura documents 
the heartache of her separation from her 
partner of 13 years, and fellow artist, Matthew 
Barney. Footnotes in the album book mark the 
chronology of their breakup. 
In “Stonemilker,” surrounded by the vast rocky 
terrain of Iceland, Björk looks straight into the 
camera singing, “a juxtaposition in fate/ ind our 
mutual coordinates… show me emotional respect, 
oh respect, oh respect” Her asymmetrical 
lorescent yellow dress accentuates her motions 
as she waves her arms. Björk’s performance has 
a strength and whimsical presence as she sings 
a declaration of heartache, a juxtaposition that 
can be seen in many of her songs.
Themes like the power and vastness of nature, 
heightened emotions, technology, and 
exploration of the human psyche remain constant 
in Björk’s work. As we progress further into the 
digital age, technology is not only a tool, but a 
necessity to participate in contemporary culture 
and industry. In an interview with Creative 
Review, Björk discussed her connection to 
technology as a maker: “I feel it is important that 
the artist helps deine it and mold it. Because 
who else is going to put humanity and soul into 
it?” 
Björk is not deining this on her own though. 
Collaborating with writers, software developers, 
artists, designers, and musicians, Björk released 
a multimedia interactive music app that allows 
you to explore her 2011 album, Biophilia in 
3D space through videos, games, essays, and 
interfaces that allow you to create your own 
mixes from instruments used in each of the songs. 
It is now being used in public middle school 
education across Iceland and other parts of 
Scandinavia.
Her eclectic sound inluenced by dance, 
electronic, pop, classical, and avant-garde music 
isn’t for everyone, but the relevance and power 
of her voice holds a lot of weight in shaping the 
path of contemporary music and interdisciplinary 
art. Regardless, anyone can appreciate the 
artistry of the costumes, visuals, and videos 
that frame her songs. Björk addresses how we 
understand ourselves and our roles in a global 
and information-saturated society suspended in

Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
Carnegie Mellon students support our fellow musicians
Valerie Senavsky | Junior Staffwriter
On Friday evening, hundreds of staff, students, and 
community members packed into the College of 
Fine Arts (CFA) theaters to hear musicians of the 
Pittsburgh Symphony play. The audience did not pay 
a cent for the nearly two full hours of entertainment. 
And the musicians, despite looking and playing their 
best, were not paid for their efforts.
Negotiations for a renewed three-year contract 
between the musicians and Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra, Inc. (PSO) Management began in 
February, extended two weeks beyond contract 
renewal, and continued for another two weeks with 
federal negotiators until the musicians’ strike began 
Friday, Sept. 30. Management will not budge from 
their final offer of a dramatically-reduced salary, 
modified retirement plans, and reduced orchestra 
personnel.
These cuts, if accepted, would be devastating to the 
future of the PSO. As one of the ten best sympho-
nies in the country, respected and acclaimed world-
wide, the group boasts some of the nation’s best 
musicians. The dramatic drop in salary would put the 
PSO’s pay on par with symphonies of a much lower 
caliber. With these cuts, PSO “would not be able 
to recruit and retain the same types of musicians 
that we have now,” Micah Howard, chair of the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Musicians Committee, said in a 
press release with TribLIVE. This pay drop would not 
only discourage newcomers from joining, but would 
also drive top talent to other orchestras.
Management seems adamant on these changes, 
however. All concerts have been canceled until Oct. 
27. On Tuesday, Management released a statement 
declaring its intent to hire out other musicians in the 
community to replace the orchestra, in an effort to 
bring music to its patrons. 
Members of the community recognize this as a 
scare tactic. “Pittsburgh’s community [of musicians] 
is so tight,” Lisa Levinson said. “There’s no way 
anyone is willing to walk through the picket lines.” 
Levinson, a Pittsburgh native, has been a part of the 
music community since 1980 and has bought ticket 
subscriptions to PSO concerts for 35 years.
The musicians are not staying silent, however. 
Picketers in bright yellow “Musicians of the 
Pittsburgh Symphony” t-shirts have swarmed Heinz 
Hall ever since the strike began, including members 
of the symphony, community members, and dozens 
of Carnegie Mellon students. The musicians have 
also been putting on free concerts and playing in 
the streets. A brass quartet serenaded passersby in 
front of downtown restaurants last weekend in lieu 
of the John Williams concert, and musicians also 
performed outside the Pittsburgh courthouse. On the 
PSO’s annual day of giving, Tuesday, the musicians 
organized and put on 11 free concerts, making their 
own “Day of Music” thanking the community for 
their support.
The performance that should have taken place in 
Heinz Hall on Friday was dubbed “CMU Night 
at the PSO” and is a standing tradition; School of 
Music students annually attend one show at the 
symphony en masse in celebration of our strong 
relationship. Nearly all private instrumental instruc-
tors at Carnegie Mellon are also members of the 
PSO, as well a large number of the chamber music 
coaches. The show at Heinz Hall was canceled, but 
the musicians, who believe that “the show must go 
on,” organized the concert Friday night in Kresge 
Theatre, asking for students’ help in publicizing the 
event to the greater Carnegie Mellon community.
The sisters of Sigma Alpha Iota stood in front of 
Doherty Hall on Wednesday, handing out flyers to 
all passersby. Music students set out a table in front 
of CFA on Friday afternoon, distributing yellow rib-
bon pins in support of the striking symphony mem-
bers. And the result was astounding. Not only was 
Kresge Theater packed, but Alumni Concert Hall 
(ACH) was utilized as a second performance space. 
The audience in ACH overflowed the seats, utilizing 
the periphery aisles and back wall as standing and 
sitting room. 
The musicians performed two parallel concerts, 
staggered twenty minutes apart, to prevent turning 
audience members away. The concert featured 
string quartets and octets, an oboe quartet, a 
woodwind trio, and cello and bass quartets playing 
music spanning from Mozart to modern-day 
Piazzolla. Between pieces, the musicians introduced 
themselves; many attended Julliard and other 
schools of great musical prestige, and some gained 
doctorate degrees in music performance or left 
posts with other orchestras when they were offered 
positions here. 
All of the musicians, though, were happy to be part 
of the PSO, sharing amazing experiences of interna-
tional tours and genuine gratitude for the opportu-
nity to play with such talented colleagues. And the 
thanks were bestowed on the audience as well: “we 
just want to play for you and make you happy,” 
explained Tatjana Mead Chamis, violist and emcee 
for the night in ACH.
The show doesn’t end here. The musicians held a 
free full-scale orchestra concert on Sunday after-
noon, playing Dvorjak’s New World Symphony, 
Wagner’s overture to Die Meistersinger, Telemann’s 
Concerto for Two Violas, and a movement from 
Mozart’s G Major Flute Concerto. The latter two 
pieces featured students from Pittsburgh Creative 
and Performing Arts School as soloists.
On the program for Friday night’s concert were a 
few pieces of Entartete Musik, which translates to 
“degenerate music.” Like a large portion of artists 
in the World War II era, many Germanic composers 
and musicians were labeled as “degenerate” due to 
their heritage; they fled Germany, and performing 
their work was banned. Chamis describes that 
musical arts “skipped a generation” in Germany, 
Vienna, and other affected areas, as the fine 
musicians had been driven away.
If the PSO disbands, or the dramatic cuts proposed 
by management are forced upon them, such a dias-
pora is conceivable for music in Pittsburgh. The fates 
of the musicians will obviously be much different 
than those under the Third Reich, but Pittsburgh’s 
top musical talent will move elsewhere. Not only will 
this affect the course and quality of the PSO, but 
this will send shock waves through the community. In 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music, a large portion 
of the technical training that instrumentalists receive 
is from the musicians of the PSO, some of the best 
in the world. In the case of PSO’s collapse, the 
quality of a Carnegie Mellon musical education will 
crumble.
Although we see overwhelming support of the 
musicians from the Pittsburgh community, the strike 
has not been resolved. To learn more about events 
held by PSO musicians in the future, how to support 
the musicians, or for more information please visit

Mattress 
Factory

Psychedelic lights, cat statues sitting on laptops, naked mannequins 
spotted with polka dots: just some stuff you might find in an indie music 
video or Urban Outfitters, right? Well, yeah, but there are also three 
apartment-style buildings in Northside Pittsburgh filled with these kinds 
of things. 
Known as The Mattress Factory, this is a contemporary art museum that 
is made up of three buildings that display works representing different 
cultures, social issues, and trends from all over the world. It was my 
first time visiting, and I can easily say that this place is one of a kind.
In the main building on 500 Sampsonia Way, I first walked into a room 
with lighting similar to that in Drake’s “Hotline Bling” music video. It 
eventually led me to the admission desk, where my friend Noni Tinglin-
Jarrett, a first-year College of Engineering student, and I got a map of 
all the exhibits throughout the three buildings. We decided to work our 
way down from the fourth floor. Once we got up to the fourth floor, 
we started hearing the sounds of policemen. The noises were coming 
from a fairly new exhibit titled Active Denial System, by Christopher 
Meerdo. This displayed screens showing footage of active policemen 
and protests. 
Another notable piece on the floor, titled “The Great Illusion”, focused 
on the issue of Palestinians in Gaza and their desire for independence. 
It was created by Mohammed Musallam, and presents pages of 
Palestinian passports scattered on barbed wire fence, placed in the 
center and on the ceiling of the room. The fourth floor seemed to have 
followed the theme of social and global justice, and reminded visitors 
of a few of the many ongoing issues that people currently deal with 
around the world.
As my friend and I continued our visit, we encountered two exhibits 
made in 1996 on the third floor that ended up being our favorites: “It’s 
all about ME, Not You” by Greer Lankton and “Infinity Dots Mirrored 
Room” by Yayoi Kusama. “It’s all about ME, Not You” displayed a 
bedroom filled with dolls and shrines crafted by Lankton, and was 
supposed to represent her life before she died from a drug overdose in 
1996. There was one doll in particular, that was shown to be suffering 
from anorexia and drug addiction, with pill bottles scattered all over 
the bed the doll was lying on. I found this exhibit to be disturbing, yet 
incredibly fascinating. 
On the other hand, walking into the “Infinity Dots Mirrored Room” 
exhibit was a fun time overall. There were two mirrored rooms covered 
in polka dots: the first one had dimmed lighting which created a party-
like atmosphere, and the second one had bright lights and mannequins 
to make it feel as though you were in a department store (covered in 
polka dots). Both exhibits were definitely unique and entertaining, so if 
you ever decide to visit the museum definitely stop by these displays.
Aside from the many other interesting works found in the main 
building, the remaining two buildings of The Mattress Factory on 
516 Sampsonia Way and 1414 Monterey St. had exhibits just as 
unique and exciting. The building on 516 Sampsonia Way was an 
entire exhibit in itself, titled “A Second Home.” It was essentially a 
home-turned-toy factory, where at every corner of the house there 
were wooden contraptions, carvings, and models. Seeing this exhibit 
certainly brought me back to my childhood. The building on 1414 
Monterey St. had a similar structure to that of the main building, with 
many different exhibits displayed on each floor. 
A personal favorite of mine from this building was an exhibit from this 
year titled “IRIS_SIRI” by Kevin Clancy. This one explored the power 
of technology and its future influences on society. The room displayed 
a model of a hand continuously scrolling down an iPad screen, a glass 
box blowing away dollar bills, and cats sitting on top of laptops. Every 
piece in this exhibit was intriguing, but the theme was a bit concerning 
since it brought up the almost-limitless power technology can have over 
our world.
What made my experience at The Mattress Factory so enjoyable was 
its unpredictability. No matter the exhibit, there was always some 
aspect that surprised me or taught me something new. The artwork in 
the museum makes visitors become more aware of certain topics, or 
allows them to literally see things that may not be as evident at first 
glance. 
If you’re looking for a museum experience that’s not only intellectually 
stimulating, but also makes you feel cool, then go visit The Mattress 
Factory.

Sometimes it feels like all there is to do or see lies 
between the Cathedral of Learning and Beeler. Craig 
and Walnut are good enough. Who needs to get on 
a bus that isn’t a 61, 71, or 28X? This little region, 
dare I say “bubble,” is safe and comfortable. But 
alas, there is life outside of Carnegie Mellon, and 
it’s pretty damn cool. You might have to take a bus 
you’ve never ridden to a street you’ve never heard 
of, but it will be worth it.
Let’s say for example, you take an inbound 54 from 
Craig and Winthrop to Liberty and 25th. You get off 
and feel unsafe for a second. Abandoned-looking 
brick buildings, a big empty parking lot behind wide 
empty sidewalks, smoke pouring out of a stack. But 
then you locate the chrome bastion of the Pittsburgh 
Opera. You look around again and begin to notice 
smaller signs of life. This is the Strip District.
The heart of the Strip lies inside just about a 
half square mile, from 16th to 25th between the 
Allegheny River and Liberty Ave. The other heart of 
the Strip is food.
Back when Pittsburgh thrived on manufacturing, the 
Strip was prime real estate — right on the river and 
the railroad. Giants like U.S. Steel, Westinghouse, 
and Heinz did their business on those streets, and 
they brought with them all the people who work 
there. Produce merchants, restaurants, and groceries 
stores opened up to feed all of the busy people walk-
ing through the streets. Today you can walk those 
same streets and eat at one of the same spots. Even 
the newer spots are filled with an authenticity that 
makes them feel like they’ve been there just as long.
If you want the old world experience, there’s Penn 
Mac, or Pennsylvania Macaroni Company. Back in 
1902, the three Sunseri brothers, newly immigrated 
from a village in Sicily, started out manufacturing and 
selling pastas, and then the store grew to include all 
kinds of delicious Italian imports, like olive oil and 
cheese. The store is still in the Sunseri family, and, if 
you get to the Strip before they close at 4:30, well-
worth the trip, if only to ogle all the treats before 
going to dinner. Penn Mac itself is an experience.
Down a couple blocks is another specialty grocery 
store, Lotus Food Company, reflecting a more recent 
influx of people. Lotus is an incredible and expansive 
Chinese-run grocery store on Penn Ave. They have 
over 20 aisles of kitchenware, packaged foods, can-
dies, spices, noodles, produce, seafood, and more. 
The store has an undeniable yet unidentifiable smell, 
a blend of anise and something I couldn’t figure out. 
And even better than the smell is the budget. You’ll 
never get vegetables at Giant Eagle for these prices. 
They even offer discounts if you show your student ID.
You can also go to Labad’s Mediterranean Grocery 
for incredible gyros from a man with an incredible 
moustache, S&D Polish Deli to score some crispy, 
buttery pierogies, or Reyna Foods for their famous 
tortillas and tamales.
Even though the Strip is at its most lively in the late 
morning and early afternoon, there are some awe-
some dinner and drink spots.
For dinner I decided to splurge a little at Kaya, a 
part of the Big Burrito restaurant group. I got there 
at 7 p.m., a half hour too late to partake in the best 
happy hour in Pittsburgh: all single serving drinks are 
half off from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Monday to Friday! 
Regardless, I still indulged in a cocktail called Smoke 
and Ginger, which I highly recommend to tequila 
lovers and no one else. The smoky mezcal and 
spicy ginger liqueur are offset by hibiscus, lime, and 
orange bitters. Not to mention, the bright hibiscus 
pink is a really exciting drink color!
For dinner, I wanted to try more than one thing. I 
picked a small plate of bright citrus-y shrimp and 
scallop ceviche paired with a bowl of warm and 
creamy conch and corn chowder. I’ve never had 
conch before, but years of watching Top Chef have 
made me curious. Not only was it the perfect amount 
of food, but I felt like I was a block away from a 
bright Caribbean beach. The next time I go back I’ve 
already decided on the fish tacos. And if you ever 
make your way to Kaya, ask to sit in Chas’s section.
Other awesome dinner spots include: Bar Marco for 
a stellar selection of wines and cocktails with modern 
decor and cuisine, Penn Ave. Fish Company for high 
quality seafood dishes and affordable sushi like the 
Sexy Señorita or Lollipop rolls, or Smallman Galley, 
an incubator that features four different restaurants 
on a rotating basis.
If you’re feeling withdrawal from your comfort zone, 
Pamela’s is there to serve up a tall stack of hotcakes. 
La Prima is there to roast, grind, and brew espresso 
to its normal level of perfection. Primanti Brothers is 
there to pervert the definition of a sandwich.
But in a neighborhood like the Strip, there are too 
many boundary-pushing options to settle for some-
thing you’ve already tried. While you’re out of 
your Carnegie Mellon Bubble, do as many things 
as you can that feel weird to you. Stop and talk to 
a stranger. Walk down an empty alley and check 
out the graffiti. Try a food you’ve never tasted, or 
a food you’ve never heard of. Don’t settle for what 
you know when what lies beyond your comfort zone 
could be so much cooler.8

It was a dark and stormy Friday night. For any 
other event, the sudden evening rain would have 
been a nightmare. But it perfectly fit the vibe that 
the Delta Foundation of Pittsburgh was looking for 
during their Nightmare on Hellsworth.
Sponsored by pro-LGBT non-profit organization 
Delta Foundation of Pittsburgh, gay bar Element, 
and iHeartRadio’s 96.1 KISS — Pittsburgh, 
Nightmare on Hellsworth kicked off October and 
the Halloween festivities with their free concert, 
featuring Zara Larsson, the Swedish singer behind 
“Never Forget You,” and The Brighton Boys, a pop 
rock band from New Brighton, Pennsylvania. In 
between sets, DJ Colt also provided music for the 
event and kept the crowd lively and entertained 
during the near torrential onslaught.
The rain, however, didn’t keep people of all ages 
from being decked out in their Halloween costumes. 
Witches, zombies, princesses, and “Cat-in-the-
Hat’s” roamed the street during the event. And 
when it wasn’t pouring, rock stars, the Joker, and 
the Belchers were also seen grabbing a bite to eat 
at one of the many bars and restaurants on the 
street, such as B&B Fired Up Goodness, 5801 Video 
Lounge and Café, The Elbow Room, Harris Grill, 
and Tipsy Cow. 
Hostesses dressed as Maleficent, nefarious pirates 
sold $5 beer at their restaurants, and food truck 
Bella Christie’s Sweet Boutique sold their delicious 
desserts at the event. The sweet treats were not 
only a hit with the crowd, but also with the security 
guards and event staff.
Several organizations also set up promotional tents 
for the event. Hair Pride offered hair spray for 
people at the event to use to style their own hair. 
LuLaRoe also sold their comfy clothes at the event, 
selling their bright and colorful leggings, dresses, 
shirts, and cardigans that are great for any season. 
Monster Vape also sold their “premium ejuice,” giv-
ing the opportunity for people to learn about vap-
ing. Sponsor iHeartRadio also set up their own tent 
and prize wheel, where you could win things from 
Pittsburgh-themed swag like lanyards and Pirates 
bottle openers to Taylor Swift 1989 knapsacks. 
People of all ages explored the tents and businesses 
on Ellsworth Avenue, offering additional entertain-
ment between sets and opening up a new market to 
businesses.
The Brighton Boys’ performance at Nightmare on 
Hellsworth brought even more liveliness to the rainy 
night, not afraid to have a great time and jam out 
with themselves and their fans. The pop rock band 
played some of their original songs from their 
album Love Sentence and their EP MMXV as well 
as classics such as The Clash’s “Should I Stay or 
Should I Go” and Fountains of Wayne’s “Stacy’s 
Mom” and even stayed after their performance to 
help set up the stage for Zara Larsson and interact 
with the crowd, bringing a rock and roll vibe to 
their music and the energy of the crowd that rever-
berated throughout the night.
Zara Larsson’s performance was much anticipated 
throughout the night, and she did not disappoint, 
performing her instant hits “Never Forget You” 
and “Lush Life,” songs from her EP Uncover and 
her new single “Ain’t My Fault.” Her show brought 
out the best in the crowd throughout the rain and 
closed out the night on a high note and with a ton 
of energy.
Despite the rain, Nightmare on Hellsworth brought 
a ton of life and fright to the night, with people 
actually bonding and dancing through the rain. 
The musical acts never failed to hype up the crowd 
through the storm, and seemed to bond with the 
crowd in the sudden appearance of the rain and 
the general good vibes that they wanted to keep 
up and bring out throughout the entire night. And 
in the end, you could even say the Nightmare on 
Hellsworth felt a little bit like a dream.
