Worms exploit 
Microsoft
vulnerability
by James Auwaerter
Copy Staff
Two weeks before school began, 
most Carnegie Mellon students were 
not exactly diving into their closets to 
pack for their eventual return. Some, 
however, like international and first- 
year students, arrived before the rest, 
and Computing Services greeted 
them with news of a computer bug, 
the MS.Blaster worm.
The MS.Blaster worm takes advan­
tage of a vulnerability in computers 
that run the newer versions of 
Microsoft’s prominent operating sys­
tem (Windows 2000 and Windows 
XP) to make changes to the OS and 
send out copies of itself to other com­
puters. Microsoft found out about the 
vulnerability in June, and released a 
patch fixing the vulnerability on July 
16. The MS.Blaster worm was first 
discovered on August 11, and 
Symantec reported on August 14 that 
over one million hosts were infected. 
The worm was set to check the date, 
and if it was August 16 or later, 
launch a DoS (denial of service) 
attack against http://www.window- 
supdate.com. The most popular form 
of digital disruption, DoS attacks 
attempt to disable a website by flood­
ing the server hosting it with massive 
amounts of traffic. Microsoft’s URL 
redirects users to the Microsoft 
Windows Update page, used for the 
dissemination of the patch, which 
was released in July. Since the site 
merely redirects people to the real 
update server, Microsoft was able to 
stop that attack fairly quickly.
Beyond that obvious attack, the 
worm also causes trouble with 
routers and firewalls, which are 
stretched to capacity trying to filter 
out all the network traffic. A seeming­
ly more benign form of the worm, 
called Nochi or Welchia, downloads 
the patch which fixes the exploit. 
However, it then will send itself out to 
other machines, causing just as much 
traffic, and make other changes, 
including opening another security 
hole. It is also more efficient at 
spreading itself than other forms of 
MS.Blaster. Therefore, it has been 
able to crash several major computer 
systems, including the Navy Marine 
Corps Intranet.
In the first week that foreign stu­
dents arrived on campus, around 300 
people were taken off the network 
because of some sort of infection. 
“[MS.Blaster] can infect a machine 
within a matter of seconds.... It’s not 
a matter of how long you are on the 
network; it’s a matter of ‘are you on 
when your IP address comes up,’ “ 
according to John Lerchey, a comput­
er and network security coordinator 
at CMU. What Lerchey is referring to 
is the way computers communicate 
with each other on the network. The 
server acts as a sort of post office, 
assigning IP addresses, which act like 
real addresses, so Internet traffic gets 
directed to the right place.
After this beginning to the year, 
Computing Services mounted aggres­
sive measures to contain the worm’s 
impact. An email went out to all 
Andrew accounts, and the patch was 
put onto the QuickReg page, where 
all computers are directed upon con­
necting to the wired or wireless net­
work. Even so, the computers’ IP 
addresses are renewed often enough 
that machines have been infected 
while downloading the patch, or the 
latest update to the Windows operat­
ing system. Additionally, fliers are 
being given to all people purchasing 
new computers at the Computer 
Store and to all Orientation 
Counselors. Resident Advisors were 
given a CD with all the files needed in 
most cases to get a machine patched 
and in proper condition to be allowed 
on the network.
To make things even more hectic, 
the traditional first-year introduction 
to computing at CMU, Freshstart, was 
still a drain for people in Computing 
Services. “This worm is like a bad 
rash — it spreads quickly,” said junior 
mechanical engineering student Tyler 
Bowman. Approximately half of all 
people walking into the Atrium were 
either infected with MS.Blaster, or 
had not patched their machines 
before trying to setup their wireless 
(the other major reason for walking

University Center renovations transform basement
by Andrew Johnson
Editor-in-Chief
The grand opening of the 
University Center basement facilities 
on August 29 marks the fulfillment 
of space left abandoned since the 
Center’s doors opened in August of 
1996. Initial discussions on the reno­
vations began late in the fall of 2002, 
and the dialogue’s fruition repre­
sents a major coup for students, 
whose year 2000 counterparts 
opposed a corporate presence in the 
very same space.
While the big push to get the facil­
ities in place started with Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy, for­
mer Student Body President Brian 
Namey said the space was designed 
by the students and for the students. 
During his presidency last year, 
Namey led the Exploratory Space 
Task Force (ESTF), which was com­
posed of students and administra­
tors, to determine a plan for renova­
tion that would be well-received.
A new rec room, dubbed Scotland 
Yard, includes a variety of table 
games like pool and ping pong, as 
well as video games, from the old- 
school Galaga to the latest craze, 
Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), and 
seems to be up to standards.
“It’s nice. It’s bigger than I expect­
ed; I was worried when I saw the 
plans,” said Fred Merkle, a first-year 
ECE graduate student and former 
Activities Board chairperson.
“Scotland Yard is a nice touch.”
“Every night, there have been 
more and more people in the game 
room,” said University Center 
Director Marcia Gerwig, though she 
noted that it is hard to gauge the 
popularity of the project with orien­
tation week being the only metric.
Jason Malatack, a sophomore biol­
ogy major, said he likes to play pool 
and his roommate is “all about the 
DDR.”
“It’s nice just to relax down here,” 
he said.
Andy’s, the new eatery in the base­
ment, offers coffee drinks, smooth­
ies, and sandwiches. In keeping with 
the student-oriented bent of the ren­
ovations, Andy’s also helps to 
address an ongoing concern — a lack 
of healthy and vegetarian dining 
options on campus. The non-Dining 
Services-affiliated cafe is the result 
of a proposal submitted by Student 
Activities, the division that also runs 
Skibo Coffeehouse.
“I want to open a coffeeshop of my 
own when I retire, in a college town 
of course,” said Coordinator of 
Student Activities (SA) Dan Barnett 
who captained the proposal and 
along with the staff of Skibo 
designed the menu.
Since a Barnett-driven rehaul of 
the Skibo menu, sales have tripled, 
which was a factor in SA’s submitting 
a proposal to fill the space — other 
proposals from independent compa­
nies were also considered. Skibo, 
incidentally, also had some renova­
tions this summer and now includes 
a “cyber-bar” that will allow students 
to surf the web as they dine, has 
installed new artwork, and will have 
live music every Wednesday this 
semester. Skibo is used to prepare 
the food sold at Andy’s, though there 
is little menu overlap, said Barnett.
John Hannon, director of Student 
Activities, was involved in the early 
stages of the project and helped 
guide the project during the sum­
mer. He said that it was miraculous 
that the space has been completed 
on time.
“We were on a tight timeline, so a 
lot of decisions had to be made on 
the fly, during construction,” he said.
First-year business major Santiago 
Guzman also said he liked the new 
facilities, though he griped at the 
costs. All of the arcade games, with 
the exception of DDR Extreme and a 
VR-like game called Vortek which 
both run a dollar, cost 50 cents. The 
digital jukebox costs $1 for two 
plays, or $5 for 14 plays.
The original plan would have 
placed the improvements on the sec­
ond floor, displacing some of the 
upstairs fitness areas to the base­
ment, but after further talks and 
research, the ESTF changed the plan 
to its current incarnation.
Stan Krowitz, the University 
Center Administrator who can be 
found walking the halls of the UC in 
the evening, said that keeping the fit-

CMU student arrested on drug charges
by Alexander Meseguer
News Editor
Mark Parraway, a now former 
junior computer science student, 
was arrested and charged with drug- 
related offenses in mid-July. New 
evidence suggests his arrest may 
have been in error. According to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on July 29, 
Parraway had several items seized 
from his luggage at the Pittsburgh 
International Airport on the way to 
visit his grandmother in Raleigh, 
N.C. The containers field-tested pos­
itive for cocaine, methamphetamine, 
and ecstasy, which prompted a Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
search on Parraway’s Theta Xi resi­
dence. However, KDKA reported on 
August 15 that the substances con­
fiscated from Parraway were tested 
in the Allegheny County crime lab to 
be the legal drug dextromethor­
phan, which is not listed on the 
DEA’s drug schedule. The schedule 
lists every substance that the DEA 
attempts to control.
DEA authorities were surprised to 
hear of the findings, noting that 
false positives in field testing are 
rare.
Parraway’s lawyer was quoted at 
the time of his arrest that the
charges would not pan out in rigor­
ous testing. Charges currently levied 
against him include three counts of 
drug possession, two counts of drug 
possession with intent to deliver, 
and possession of drug parapherna­
lia.
According to the Campus Police 
crime blotter, Parraway’s Theta Xi 
residence was searched by the DEA 
on July 17 around six in the evening. 
The DEA called CMU Police that day 
to inform them of the impending 
search.
“Our job is really just to facilitate, 
show them where the location is,” 
Doyle said when asked about the 
involvement of campus police in the 
search. According to the police blot­
ter, the action was listed as “Assist 
Outside Agency.” Renée 
Camerlengo, director of Student 
Life, went with Campus Police repre­
sentatives and the DEA to the Theta 
Xi house.
In mid-August, the DEA contacted 
Campus Police again to re-enter the 
house and interview some bf the 
brothers. CMU Police informed the 
DEA of their desire to keep the tar­
gets of the interviews focused, such 
as only the people who live in the 
rooms adjoining Parraway’s. They 
also suggested using Campus Police 
headquarters as a neutral arena for
the interviews rather than going 
over to the fraternity house and con­
ducting them there. Doyle said that 
since then they have not contacted 
Campus Police about conducting 
such interviews.
When contacted concerning the 
case, DEA Detective Don Michael 
Oesterle of the airport enforcement 
division said he could not comment 
on pending investigations.
Pittsburgh DEA administration 
officials also declined to comment, 
citing similar reasons.
When approached about the inci­
dent, an unidentified Theta Xi broth­
er said, “I have nothing to say about 
that.”
The Post-Gazette also reported 
Parraway stating that he buys and 
sells the substance dextromethor­
phan in large quantities 
as part of a legitimate business. 
Dextromethorphan, also known as 
DXM, is found in Robitussin and 
according to “Recreational DXM” 
(http://www.dextromethorphan.ws) 
is used for recreational purposes by 
many. Its effects can be compared to 
the dissociative drugs ketamine and 
PCP. The site also contains links to 
instructions on how to extract DXM 
from Robitussin.
The Division of Student Affairs 
declined to comment.
UC post office centralizes 
campus mail distribution
by Hannah Yi
Staffwriter
Students will now have to venture 
into the basement of the University 
Center to pick up their mail and 
food-filled packages from home. 
The University Mail Center (UMC), 
which opened August 4, is a consol­
idation of five different postal ser­
vices locations that were once scat­
tered around the campus, and hous­
es mailboxes that will remain with 
students until they graduate. All 
undergraduates living on and off 
campus are provided with a mail­
box. Graduate students have the 
option to rent a mailbox for $50 a 
year. There are a total of 6,358 mail­
boxes.
“It’s easier to maintain everything 
in one place,” said Theresa Mele, the 
manager of campus postal services. 
“We are now able to offer exception­
al service to students and faculty 
because everything is delivered to 
one stop. Before, things were all 
spread out and hard to manage.”
Talks about creating a centralized 
mail facility had been ongoing since 
the UC was first built. Comparisons 
to other peer institutions with cen­
tralized mail facilities, such as 
Dartmouth, also helped to push for 
the UMC. However, plans for a cen­
tralized mail location took root this 
summer as the University decided to 
utilize the basement to allocate 
space for several other facilities.
“It just recently became a reality 
as part of a separate group of cir­
cumstances,” said Tim Michael, 
director of Hoi sing Services. “The 
idea for a centralized mail facility 
developed over time, and things all 
came together when we realized 
that Career Services needed a larger 
location and students wanted a 
recreational space. All the ideas just 
meshed well together.”
According to William Elliott, vice 
president of enrollment, everything 
seen in the basement was a com­
bined effort of those involved with 
the recreational area, Career Center, 
and postal services. An estimated 
one million dollars were spent creat­
ing the UMC, Career Center, recre­
ational area Scotland Yard, and 
Andy’s Eatery.
In order to accommodate the 
UMC, a new zip code (15289)

U.S. claims on Iraq 
drones debunked
BAGHDAD (AP) — Huddled over a 
fleet of abandoned Iraqi drones, U.S. 
weapons experts in Baghdad came to 
one conclusion: despite the Bush 
administration’s public assertions, 
these unmanned aerial vehicles 
weren’t designed to dispense biologi­
cal or chemical weapons.
The evidence gathered this sum- 
iiier matched the dissenting views of 
Air Force intelligence analysts who 
argued in a national intelligence 
assessment of Iraq before the war 
that the remotely piloted planes were 
tmarmed reconnaissance drones.
In building its case for war, senior 
Bush administration officials had said 
Iraq’s drones were intended to deliver 
unconventional weapons. Secretary 
of State Colin Powell even raised the 
alarming prospect that the pilotless 
aircraft could sneak into the United 
States to carry out poisonous attacks 
bn American cities.
The administration based its view 
-oh a Central Intelligence Agency find­
ing that Iraq had renewed develop­
ment of sophisticated unmanned aer­
ial vehicles — UAVs — capable of 
such attacks. The Pentagon’s Defense 
-Intelligence Agency also supported 
this conclusion.
-While the hunt for suspected 
¦weapons of mass destruction — and 
the means to deliver them — contin­
ues, intelligence and defense officials 
said the CIA and DIA stand by their 
"prewar assertions about Iraqi drone 
capabilities, some of which Powell 
highlighted in his February 5 presen­
tation to the U.N. Security Council.^1 But the Air Force, which controls 
most of the American military’s UAV 
fleet, didn’t agree with that assess­
ment from the beginning. And ana­
lysts at the Pentagon’s Missile 
Defense Agency said the Air Force 
view was widely accepted within 
their ranks as well.
Instead, these analysts believed the 
drones posed no threat to Iraq’s 
Neighbors or the United States, offi­
cials in Washington and scientists

Autistic boy dies 
during service
MILWAUKEE (AP) — An autistic 8- 
year-old boy died while being 
restrained during a church prayer ser­
vice held in an attempt to cure him, 
and one man connected with the 
small storefront church was arrested, 
police and a church official said 
Sunday.
The boy’s mother took him to the 
Faith Temple Church of the Apostolic 
Faith for the prayer service Friday 
night. Several church members 
prayed over him for more than an 
hour until someone noticed he wasn’t 
moving and called 911, said Bishop 
David Hemphill Sr.
Hemphill said the boy and his 
mother had been going to the prayer 
services for the past three weeks. 
Members of the church, made up of 
just six families, prayed for God to 
release the evil spirits that caused the 
boy’s illness, he said.
“The boy just had a problem in his 
mind, and what we were doing was 
asking God to fix ify” Hemphill said. 
“He chose to fix it by^aking him back 
home to him.
“All I know is we’r .i hot guilty of 
anything,” he said.
Church members wrapped the boy 
in sheets to keep him from scratching 
himself and others, but the boy was 
allowed to sit “any way that he feels 
comfortable,” Hemphill said.
Police would not say what the man 
could be charged with, only that they 
were awaiting the results of an autop­
sy.
“If he died, which I highly doubt, of 
some natural cause, [Hemphill] won’t 
be charged with anything too seri­
ous,” said police Captain Linda 
Haynes. She said she did not believe 
the boy had been struck during the 
service.
Police would not identify the man 
who was arrested, but Hemphill said
it was his brother, Ray Hemphill, 
another minister at the church. The 
church is not connected to any larger 
denomination and has only six fami­
lies that gather twice a week to pray 
and discuss Scripture, Hemphill said.
“We believe that according to the 
word of God, a person could get evil 
spiritedness,” he said. “Either God’s 
going to have to deliver, or we’re 
going to have to do whatever we can 
until things get better.”
The church’s main window was 
boarded up Sunday, as were those of 
several businesses that neighbor it in 
a run-down strip mall on the city’s 
northwest corner.
Rain ends some 
Montana fires
HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Much- 
needed rain during the weekend qui­
eted three dozen major wildfires rav­
aging Montana, but fire officials 
warned crews and area residents 
Sunday not to let their guard down 
yet.
“It’s still a fairly tentative situa­
tion,” said Sandy Kratville, an infor­
mation officer with the Northern 
Rockies Interagency Information 
Center in Missoula. “We’re staying 
ready.”
Kratville said the coming week was 
expected to bring more of the same 
conditions that had fed the fires for 
the past month: dry air and high tem­
peratures. According to the National 
Interagency Fire Center, wildfires still 
active Sunday had burned about 
520,900 acres across seven western 
states. Fires in Montana accounted 
for almost 350,000 of those acres.
A complex of fires about 35 miles 
from Missoula was still keeping 195 
people from their homes. In the east­
ern part of the state, at least five 
blazes were contained during the 
weekend, freeing firefighters to help 
farther west.

weather as we have it,” said fire infor­
mation officer Gary Hoshide. “It’s still 
volatile out there.”

States,” Bob Boyd, director of the Air 
Force Intelligence Analysis Agency,

land.”
U.S. troops leave 
Liberian mainland
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — A 150- 
strong Marine force withdrew to war­
ships off the Liberian capital’s coast 
on Sunday, ending significant U.S. 
military deployment on the ground 
after just 11 days and disappointing 
many Liberians.
The Marines said American troops 
would be in better position on the 
warships to respond to any flare-ups 
in Liberia’s week-old peace accord, 
meant to end 14 years of conflict that 
has claimed more than 150,000 lives.
Liberians, watching U.S. military 
helicopters whir out of sight in the 
unannounced departure, spoke fear­
fully of being deserted.
“They’re forsaking us,” said 22- 
year-old Emmanuel Slawon, watch­
ing the last U.S. helicopter sortie fly 
out of Liberia’s main airport, dan­
gling a Humvee in a giant sling.
“We wish they’d stay until peace 
would come,” Slawon said. “Their 
presence here puts fear in our fighters 
- it makes them think if they carry on 
hostilities, they’ll be handled by the 
Americans.”
A West African peace force that 
arrived about three weeks ago has 
helped stop fighting in Monrovia. The 
government and two main rebel 
movements also signed a peace 
accord made possible by the August 11 resignation and exile of former 
President Charles Taylor, now in 
Nigeria.
But clashes persist in the country­
side, sending refugees fleeing this 
weekend several miles from the air­
port.
U.S. military helicopters flew over 
that area Sunday, on a patrol request­
ed by West African forces to try to 
help determine the source of all of the 
gunfire and artillery explosions on 
Friday.
Liberian Defense Minister Daniel 
Chea also claimed fighting persisted 
Sunday near the Guinea border. It 
was impossible to verify the allega­
tion.
President Bush put the rapid-reac- 
tion force on the ground August 14, 
under pressure internationally to 
intervene to quell bloodletting in 
Liberia, a nation founded by freed 
American slaves with United States 
government backing in the 19th cen­
tury.

Student threatens 
Bryant’s accuser
(U-WIRE) IOWA CITY, Iowa — A 
fifth-year University of Iowa senior 
whom a friend called the “least 
person from mean that I know” 
was arrested by FBI agents 
Thursday and charged with threat­
ening to kill the woman who has 
accused NBA star Kobe Bryant of 
raping her.
John William Roche, 22, 
allegedly left a profane message on 
the answering machine of a 
woman who is listed as a witness in 
the third-degree sexual-assault 
case in Eagle County, Colo.
Longtime friend Elliot Schwind, 
22, said Roche stayed at his home 
in Dubuque for a golf tournament 
the weekend of July 27 — when 
authorities say the call was made. 
The Loras College student has 
known Roche since seventh grade 
and described him as a “sports 
fanatic” and a “smart kid who real­
ly makes you feel comfortable.
“He is the least person from 
mean that I know, and I know he 
would never threaten anyone’s 
life,” Schwind said Thursday night. 
“We had been drinking since tee- 
off at 11 am, so we were all pretty 
drunk at night when he called. I 
know he absolutely didn’t remem­
ber making this call the next day.”
Court records show that Roche 
has three public-intoxication 
charges and one charge of posses­
sion of alcohol under the legal age
in Johnson County between 1999 and 
2000.
Schwind said he was not present 
when Roche made the phone call, but 
he said the comments were probably 
“pretty lewd” because of impaired 
judgment.
According to a federal grand-jury 
indictment, Roche said he would 
“stick a coat hanger up [her]” and 
repeatedly said he would kill her on 
the answering machine message.
Roche is charged with making a 
threatening telephone call across 
state lines; he faces up to five years in 
federal prison and a $250,000 fine.
The rape charge against Bryant has 
garnered nationwide attention, 
including website and radio stations 
that have posted the identity and 
phone number of Bryant’s accuser. 
Schwind said a person he did not 
know at the party supplied Roche 
with her number, which he found on 
the Internet. The call was placed from 
a cellular phone, Schwind said, but 
he was unsure of who owned it.

British Prime Minister Tony

judicial inquiry this week to face 
questions related to his administra­

threat of Iraq’s weapons of mass 
destruction. The inquiry is also 
investigating the death of senior 
British weapons advisor David Kelly, 
who committed suicide after being 
linked to the dossier scandal.

Fool.” His next album, “Chicken 
and Beer,” will hit stores next 
month, roughly coinciding with 
the concert. Bigelow said 
Ludacris’s immense popularity 
among college students and bois­
terous persona make him an ideal 
choice.
“Ludacris offers a major attrac­
tion, with a fresh option from tradi­
tional college rock availability,” 
Bigelow said. “Ludacris plays the 
type of music that Duke doesn’t see 
a lot of.”
Tickets are not yet on sale, but 
Bigelow said prices will be $20 in 
advance for Duke students, who 
will have the first right of refusal 
on prime seating.
Total capacity will be about 
4,500 for the concert, and Bigelow 
expects a mixture of students and 
other young people from the sur­
rounding area.
Other acts that were considered 
for the concert but abandoned 
because of scheduling issues were 
Bob Dylan and a combined set of 
Ben Harper and G-Love and 
Special Sauce, said senior Dylan 
Ashbrook, chair of major attrac­
tions for the Union.
“We’re dealing with administra­
tors who are by and large middle- 
aged, who don’t listen to this type 
of music,” Bigelow said. “There 
were some people who had no idea 
who Ludacris was. Everyone had 
security concerns... A lot of those 
concerns translated into specific 
security measures [which are still 
being negotiated].” A successful 
and safe concert could portend a 
return to the musical glory days of 
Cameron, which last hosted a 
major concert in 1996.
Murphy’s funds

PITTSBURGH (AP) — As Mayor 
Tom Murphy tries to close ' 
Pittsburgh’s budget gap by layingf * 
off 731 employees, union officials 
and taxpayer watchdog groups are 
criticizing city leaders for not ' 
slashing spending on pet projects. '
Murphy and City Council have' ¦ 
used tax dollars to help buy a heat-1 
ed sidewalk at a pricey restaurant; 
to fund a Victorian garden and to 
plan Ultimate Frisbee fields. 
Council Finance Chairman Sala 
Udin steered $5,000 to a friend’s" 
bar for a new sidewalk. And 
Councilwoman Barbara Burn's 
dropped $3,400 on a dozen flower 
baskets on the street where she' 
owns a general store.
All told, officials have spent $12 
million on pet projects over the 
past four years.
“If there’s not enough money to' 
pay for the critical jobs in the city, 
the front-line public safety jobs;* 
the senior centers, the pools, how 
can there be money to pay for this 
stuff?” said Jeff Vesci, president of 
the city paramedics union.
Records examined , by thfe 
PittsburghTribune-Review show 
council and the administration' 
kept spending even as a financial' 
crisis loomed. The mayor and 
council have earmarked all but $2 
million of the $14 million available'- 
to them in major discretionary pro" 
grams.

“Dead” man, 73, 
wakes in morgue
HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — An 
elderly Vietnamese man who spent 
seven hours in a drawer at a hospi­
tal morgue in Ho Chi Minh City 
was found alive by relatives who 
had come to bury him, an official 
said Friday.
Nguyen Van Quan, 73, was 
admitted to the Nguyen Tri 
Phuong hospital last week after 
complaining of a tight chest, said 
Thu Ba of Ho Chi Minh City’s 
Health Department.
By the time Quan arrived at the 
hospital, his whole body was dark 
purple.
He had experienced heart fail­
ure, his blood pressure was zero 
and no pulse was felt, she said.
Hospital staff tried unsuccess­
fully for 30 minutes to resuscitate 
him, Ba said.
Quan was sent to the hospital 
morgue at 11 pm on August 15 and 
was discovered seven hours later 
by his daughter and son-in-law, 
who had come to take his body 
home for his funeral, the English 
daily Vietnam News reported 
recently.
“I was shocked and frightened 
when I saw the blanket that cov­
ered my father moving as my hus­
band and I stood in front of the 
drawer he was in,” Nguyen Thi Gai 
was quoted as telling the paper. 
“When the morgue’s officials 
pulled back the blanket, my 
father’s eyes moved, brightening 
with joy.”
Quan was sent back to the inten­
sive care unit where he had fallen * 
into a coma and was breathing 
through a respirator on Friday, Ba 
said.
Quan suffers from asthma and 
had been admitted to the hospital 
many times before with breathing 
difficulties, she said.
The newspaper quoted a morgue 
official as saying that only one of 
the two air conditioners was run­
ning at the time Quan was there, 
which likely kept him from freez­
ing to death.
The incident is being investigate 
ed, Ba said. Hospital officials 
declined comment.
Magician plans 
six-week fasting
LONDON (AP) — For his latest' 
trick, magician David Blaine win­
try to last more than six weeks 
without food in a large plastic box 
suspended high over central 
London.
Starting Sept. 5, Blaine will live 
in a plastic box 7 feet long, 7 feet 
deep and 3 feet wide for 44 days 
without food or contact with the 
outside world, a representative 
said Thursday.
The street magician-turned- 
endurance performer previously 
spent 35 hours standing atop a 100-foot-tall pole and three days 
encased in ice.
Both of those stunts took place 
in New York City.
Unlike the feats performed by 
his hero, Harry Houdini, this latest 
challenge for Blaine won’t be to 
escape, but to survive.
All he’ll have in the box is a tube 
for water and a tube for urine.

Crime & Incident
Fire Alarm, 8/14/03, 7:17 pm — 
Campus Police responded to a fire 
alarm in the New House basement, 
where they spoke with a FMS 
employee who explained that the 
alarm had gone off when steam 
poured out of a pipe he had been 
working on. A city fire unit responded 
to the fire alarm. No one was report­
ed injured.
Attempted Forced Entry, 
8/19/03, 8:35 am — An employee of 
La Prima Coffee in the Baker Hall 
basement contacted Campus Police to 
report that someone had tried to 
break into the shop by chipping away 
at the wood near the lock. The 
responding officer noted that some 
wood was missing from the door but 
that the door had not been forced 
open and advised the employee to 
place a metal plate between the lock 
and the door handle.
Fire Alarm, 8/19/03,10:30 pm — 
A Campus Police officer was dis­
patched in response to a fire alarm 
originating in Kappa Delta Rho fra­
ternity house’s basement. The officer 
observed neither smoke nor fire, and 
was informed by a brother of the 
house that the alarm had been set off 
by work he had been doing on some 
plywood. He told the officer that the 
fire alarm had been directly above 
him while he was working, and that 
wood particles thrown in the air as a 
result of the work he had been doing 
were to blame. City fire units 
responded and the alarm system was 
reset.
Medical, 8/19/03, 10:51 pm —
Campus Police and EMS responded 
to a report of an injury on the field of 
Gesling Stadium. They accosted a stu­
dent who stated that he had fallen 
awkwardly on his ankle while jump­
ing during a game of Ultimate 
Frisbee. EMS applied an air splint to 
the student’s ankle before Campus 
Police transported him to the 
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh for 
further medical attention. The stu­
dent’s on-duty housefellow was 
informed of the incident.
Theft, 8/20/03, 7:02 pm — A
first-year CMU student contacted 
Campus Police about a possible theft. 
The student explained to the 
responding officer that he had 
arrived the morning of the same day 
and had received assistance from sev­
eral upperclassmen in transporting 
his belongings up to his room in the 
New House dormitory. Later, as the 
student was setting up his room, he 
noticed that a table lamp, a wireless 
keyboard, and a wireless mouse, esti­
mated at a total value of $360, were 
all missing from his room. The stu­
dent explained further that it may be 
possible that some of these items 
were accidently placed in the wrong 
room. The officer instructed the stu­
dent to contact Campus Police if that 
were the case.
Medical, 8/22/03, 11:52 am — A
CMU professor contacted Campus 
Police complaining of nauseau, dizzi­
ness, and stomach pains. Campus 
Police found the professor in the 
Baker Hall 132 lounge, where CMU 
,EMS later arrived and assessed him. 
His wife was contacted, and she 
directed Campus Police to transport 
-him to PUPMC Presbyterian ER, 
where the hospital staff would be in 
contact with his primary physician. 
Campus Police complied.
Injury, 8/22/03, 6:00 pm — A
Campus Police officer responded to a 
medical report originating in Skibo 
Coffeehouse, where he accosted a 
FMS employee who explained that a 
table he had been moving had slipped 
from his hands and fallen on his foot. 
Campus EMS arrived and applied 
first aid to the injured employee’s 
foot. He was then transported to 
UPMC Shadyside for further medical 
treatment.

Big bang residue 
found, measured
Along with scientists from the 
University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie 
Mellon Astrophysicist Bob Nichol 
has released findings that point to 
the existence of dark energy’s 
“shadow” on cosmic radiation, 
residue of cooled radiation from the 
Big Bang at the dawn of the 
Universe.
Nichol and his University of 
Pittsburgh counterparts,Andrew 
Connolly and Ryan Scranton, are 
receiving media attention from pub­
lications like the New Scientist and 
the New York Times.
Nichol also made an appearance 
on the David Letterman show on 
July 28.
The team worked with other 
astronomers across the country, 
attempting to locate the imprints of 
dark energy by monitoring the vital 
signs, brightness and positions of 100 million celestial bodies as part 
of mapping, in detail, one quarter of 
the sky, and measuing the distances 
to more than a million galaxies and 
quasars.
The system, called the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), corre­
lates millions of galaxies against a 
cosmic microwave background 
(CMB) temperature maps from 
NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave 
Anisotrophy Probe (WMAP).
The project is part of NASA’s 
efforts to measure the temperature 
of the CMB,the remnant heat 
fromthe Big Bang. The mission 
seeks to estimate conditions as they 
existed in the early universe by mea­
suring the properties of the CMB 
over the full sky.
Researchers had to study many 
millions of galazies before they dis­
covered a physical evidence of dark 
energy, and had searched 3,400 
square degrees of sky. ^
GMC funds car f
interface research
Over the next five years, the 
General motors Company plans £p 
continue its “smart car” research it 
has been conducting at Carnegie 
Mellon. The project aims to create,-a 
gesture-sensitive interface that will 
revolutionize the way cars and dri­
vers interact. ^
The research also aims to develop 
a way the car’s computer collect 
information about drivcer need^ 
and preferences, weather, road con­
ditions, and anything else available 
on the Internet.
The project would teach cars to 
recognize gestures like a point or 
wave to help it understand what the 
driver wants. The interface is beipg 
developed on a specially-equipped 
Pontiac minivan; this one in partic­
ular has video cameras to monitor 
the movements of its driver and pas­
sengers, a speech recognition sys­
tem that accepts verbal commands, 
email, a daily schedule and a liquid 
crystal display monitor. »r
The technology uses the latest 
wireless networks and Global 
Positioning Satellite technology to 
serve goals of safety and efficiency, 
Another subset of projects focu^ 
on the design and configuration pf 
the cars themselves, and seeks to 
raise the standards of overall system 
performance.

i Study shows bookstore on same page as online retailers
*' by Celanie Polanick
l~*Staffwriter
y-l Student opinion has long held 
•Vthat the bookstore, along with other 
« retail ventures on campus, inten­
tionally keeps prices as high as the 
v^narket will bear. That opinion was 
» ' proved wrong by the recent study 
; i Conducted by the Business Affairs 
^committee of Student Senate, which
-^'‘determined that for new and used -*¦ ¿ft•^'-textbooks, the CMU bookstore’s
* »prices are, on average, only slightly 
/- higher than those of online retailers.
Of the 67 books chosen for the 
> study, conducted over the summer,
! 37 were cheaper online by an aver­
age of 20.25 percent, and overall, 
online prices were lower by an aver­
age of 2.29 percent.
The study was a suggestion that 
¡! came out of meetings between the
head of the Business Affairs commit- 
tee, Steven Kling, a junior electrical 
*; and computer engineering major,
¦ and Patty Stacer, director of Retail
i Services.
“One of the standing missions 
[the Business Affairs committee] 
has is to improve the retail side of 
things on campus, the students’ per­
ception, and the reality of how 
things are in the bookstore, Entropy, 
any of those places,” said Kling, who 
also said he was pleased by the fact 
that the study had disproved stu- 
! dent opinions that the bookstore
! was grossly overpriced.
To conduct the study, prices of 
new books were taken from 
Amazon.com, Amazon.uk, and 
Barnes & Noble’s online bookstore, 
BN.com. Used books prices were 
compared with those on a popular 
used book site, Half.com. Kling and 
fellow committee member Aaron 
Walker, a junior mechanical engi­
neering major, developed the 
research plan entirely on their own. 
Shipping, a major price factor for all 
online booksellers, was factored in 
at the lowest going rate for all online 
numbers. The experiment, Kling 
and Walker decided, would only 
study price disparities for the exact 
same edition; no hardback/paper­
back differences, no edition swap­
ping, and no different publishers. To 
ensure good data, they used the 
ISBN, or International Standard 
Book Number, to identify subjects 
online. He recommends that stu­
dents do the same, just to make sure 
they’re purchasing what they really 
want.
“When I was going through the 
Half.com stuff, people would list old
editions, paperback editions, what­
ever, under the ISBN of the hard­
back edition. And it’s not fair to 
compare those prices for the reason 
that they’re often different books,” 
said Kling.
“It’s not really a fair price com­
parison, but it’s something that so 
many students have used that we 
felt it would be a good idea,” Kling 
said. When pricing books from 
Amazon.uk, Kling cited distance and 
currency exchange rates as some of 
the factors that drove up prices. The 
study’s findings neither condemned 
the CMU bookstore nor vindicated it 
completely, said Kling; in the end, 
the lowest possible bottom line can 
only be achieved by buying different 
books from different places.
For example, although 32 of the 
52 books Amazon carried were 
cheaper by an average of 3.30 per­
cent, the 19 that were cheaper at 
CMU’s bookstore averaged a 28.01 
percent lower price. Amazon’s dis­
counts were more frequent, but 
CMU’s discounts, combined with the 
convenience of same-day availabili­
ty and being walking distance away 
from both classes and dorms, often 
made the more substantial differ­
ence.
Amazon.uk prices are either a 
great bargain, said Kling, or inex­
plicably higher than they should be.
“You’ll find some books that are 
half-price, and some books that are 
an extra $30. Amazon, uk’s [price 
curve] is almost inverted,” he said, 
whereas most online retailers con­
sistently offer comparable prices on 
almost everything.
The reason for this, and for stu­
dents’ assumptions about CMU’s 
prices, is the way the discounts are 
presented, said CMU bookstore 
assistant manager and book buyer 
Jim Kownacki; the bookstore is far 
more likely to be able to provide 
physically smaller and used books at 
a better price.
“With any book that’s pre-priced, 
the bookstores tend to get a steeper 
discount. So what happens is, [the 
CMU bookstore] tends to get any­
where from a 20 to a 40 or 50 per­
cent discount [from the 
publisher/distributor], depending 
on the publisher’s pricing structure 
and what quantity you buy,” he said. 
The bookstore passes on as much of 
the discount as possible to the stu­
dents, said Kownacki, by marking up 
from the wholesale price.
However, online retailers mark 
down from the suggested retail 
value of the book, he said, giving the 
appearance of savings that might 
not actually exist.
Still, there are still many improve­
ments that could be made in the 
bookstore, and an important one, 
said both Kling and Kownacki, 
would be to correct the delays in the 
ordering process.
“The way the process works right 
now, the department sends the 
bookstore what books they want for 
the class, whether it’s required or 
not, how many the students they 
expect to have, etc.,” said Kling. 
“They ask for [the list] generally in 
about April. And they’re getting 
them still. The list that I did had a 
problem because a number of the
large classes hadn’t submitted their 
book orders yet. That’s one of the 
things we want to look at this year in 
the Business Affairs Committee.”
Student opinions vary, but tend to 
reflect balanced views and an eye on 
the complexities of the situation.
“I don’t have that big of a problem 
with the prices when we buy them, 
but I have a big problem with the 
amount we get back when we sell 
them back, compared to what we 
pay,” said Danielle Virgile, a junior 
psychology major.
“I think some of the books are rea­
sonably priced, and if you get used 
books, then you’re fine,” said 
Whitton Frank, a sophomore BHA 
acting and creative writing major.
Bookstore employee Mark 
Walters, who graduated with 
Masters of Arts in Literary and cul­
tural studies in the spring of 2003, 
said that a little investigation usual­
ly revealed the bookstore’s prices as 
competitive at the very least, and 
explained the price differences in 
terms similar to the conclusion of 
the study.
“If they’re less expensive, they’re 
less expensive by a margin that 
makes it not worth the shipping, like 
two or three dollars,” he said. “Every 
so often, you’ll find a tag with 
Bargain Price on it. What that means 
is that we’re selling those books for 
more than 40 percent off the retail 
price, and Jim [Kownacki] fights to 
get those discounts. When students 
come in and want the ISBN numbers 
so they can do the research, I tell 
them, do it, but you’re probably not 
going to find a better deal.”
First-year undecided HSS student David Park participates in the semi-annual purchasing of books shortly before the 
semester starts. Students will find that despite apparently high prices, the book store is comparable to online stores.

will be a few weeks before other 
industries, such as Federal Express 
and UPS, recognize the change. The 
old zip code (15213) is still active but 
will soon be phased out.
“Using the new zip code eliminates 
an extra step in the mailing system,” 
said Mele. “The mail was previously 
sent to the Oakland and North Side 
Post offices, then delivered to the 
University. Now the mail skips the 
Oakland and Northside locations and 
is delivered right to the UMC.”
No employees were laid off as a 
result of the new mail facility. Eleven 
employees manage all the packages 
and mail that run through the UMC, 
creating more work for each person 
to sift though.
“It’s a lot faster-paced, and the day 
goes by really quickly,” said Jason 
Trageser, the mailroom coordinator 
who used to run the mail facility in 
Morewood. “I now go through all the 
mail, whereas before I only had one 
third of it.”
The UMC employees are not the 
only ones having to do more work. 
Some students feel inconvenienced 
by the new facility. Talida Urwongse, 
a junior computer science major who 
used to pick up packages at West
Wing, said that it is a bit more of a 
hassle to go to the UC because it is 
farther away from her home in 
Roselawn.
“West Wing was in my direction, 
but the UC is out of the way. I’ve been 
on campus for a week and still 
haven’t checked my mail.”
However, those involved in the 
planning of the renovations purpose­
ly made an effort to create the UMC 
to maximize traffic in the new space 
and the UC.
“This new mail location will get 
people in and out of the UC,” said 
Elliott. “We also want the location to 
give students the opportunity to 
interact, socialize, and visit the 
Career Center at least once before 
they graduate.”
Overall, students are appreciative 
of the new UMC.
“It’s convenient for students to 
keep the same SMC for all four 
years,” said Emily Whittaker, a junior 
civil engineering major. “It was a pain 
each time we changed our address 
because we had to notify the bank.” 
The mail service rooms in Mudge, 
Morewood, West Wing, and Donner 
closed August 1 and are now defunct. 
Housing Services will decide in 
September what to do with the 
vacant space with the input of stu­
dents.
The University recommends that 
all undergraduate students utilizing 
an alternate address still check their 
UMC mailboxes for University corre­
spondence.

A group of first-years enjoy a game of chess in the new lounge in the University Center located next to Andy’s. A series of cof­
fee tables and comfortable leather couches give the area a feel similar to the Underground.
Alex Meseguer/News Editor
Andy’s is a new Student Activities-run dining establishment located in the UC basement. It offers smoothies and is one of the 
few places on campus to get vegetarian cuisine.
Underground no longer exclusive provider of subterranean cuisine and pool
RENOVATIONS, from page A1
ness facilities in the open helps to 
promote a healthy environment. He 
thinks that students are pleased with 
the construction, and that the num­
ber of people enjoying the space has 
grown nearly exponentially in the 
few days that the space has been 
open to students, as he has had to 
chase more and more students out at 
closing each night. The facility will 
be open during the school year until 2 am each night, though that may 
change.
The new Career Center, which is 
sharing the same space as the new 
student areas, is largely outside of 
Student Planning and will later be 
moved to a bigger space, pending 
funding. A new centralized mail- 
room is a similarly bundled but also 
largely independent venture of 
Andy’s and the rec space.
While the space is open for use, a 
number of items are still on their 
way, and have already been funded,
according to Student Body President 
Daniel Gilman. The lounge area 
adjoining Andy’s eatery will receive a 
42” plasma television today that will 
usually run CNN with sound, but will 
also be switched to other programs 
that students might be interested in 
watching in the evenings, such as 
Pittsburgh Steelers games. Gilman 
sat on the ESTF and worked on the 
project as Namey’s vice-president 
last year. Other tweaks, he said, will 
include bulletin boards along the 
hallway of the mail center, new light­
ing, and wall decorations.
In Scotland Yard, the process of 
demand-based tailoring is ongoing, 
said Gilman. For instance, the arcade 
games were chosen using a combina­
tion of student input — DDR is popu­
lar at CMU, for example — and the 
industry expertise of Dale Lazar, who 
owns the company that leases the 
machines to CMU and most of 
Pittsburgh. But the machines are fair 
game for change in the coming months.
“We’re going to monitor things,
what’s doing well and what’s not,” 
Gilman said. He noted that they had 
run out of sandwiches at Andy’s 
because they underestimated its 
potential popularity.
Erlan Barkeltbayev, a first-year 
physics student, and his checkers 
partner Guzman both noted that the 
selection in the jukebox is small, and 
Gilman said they are working on the 
student complaint that the machine 
lacks any kind of hip-hop 
selection.
Chris Smoak, AB Chairperson, has 
enjoyed a Blasting Blackberry 
smoothie from Andy’s. He said that 
during his first year at Carnegie 
Mellon in Morewood Gardens, many 
people used the poolroom as a place 
for socializing and that the space in 
the UC would have the same effect.
In his first day working at Andy’s, 
third-year creative writing student 
Corey Camp said the students loved 
the restaurant, though nearly all the 
customers have been first-years so 
far.
“An hour ago [5:30 pm], we were 
slammed,” he said about the popu­
larity of the establishment.
The rec space will also now pro­
vide a hub for the Safewalk program, 
a student escort service for nighttime 
travel, and Gilman said the idea is 
that the space will provide a more 
interesting waiting place than 
Morewood Gardens.
Throughout all stages of the plan­
ning, revenues to pay back funding 
from the University to create the rec 
space were supposed to come from 
the arcade machines. Dean Murphy 
said, though, that he doubts that the 
machines will pay back the loan, but 
the project went forward because of 
backup funding from various 
sources, such as his own budget. The 
total cost all renovations is estimated 
at $2.4 million.
The new recreational, eating, 
mail, and career facilities now occu­
py part of a space that the University 
debated leasing to Intel for E-com­
merce solution research in the fall of
2000. The University had not consid­
ered renovating the space' for lack of 
funding, and began to think about 
leasing the space temporarily to 
Intel, so that they could have the ren­
ovated space back after three to five 
years when Intel would be moved to 
a permanent off-campus location. 
Though the space would have to be 
adapted after that, the main costs in 
heating and ventilation would 
already have been addressed. 
Students, however, objected to a cor­
porate presence on campus and in a 
building whose mission statement 
was to provide “facilities for teaching 
and learning that may be used by the 
members of the community or exter­
nal organizations whose primary 
purpose is education.”
Intel eventually became part of the 
Panther Hollow Initiative and the 
facility now exists on the corner of 
Forbes and Craig. University 
President Jared Cohon wrote a letter 
to the editor in the October 16, 2000 
issue of The Tartan, acknowledging
that the plan wasn’t consistent with 
the long-term purposes of the UC, 
but that as a temporary solution 
would provide many benefits to the 
campus community.
Whether or not the fitness facili­
ties belong next to the eating facili­
ties as they are in the UC is still sub­
ject to debate. Junior H&SS student 
Zachary Hiwiller, a Student 
Dormitory Council representative on 
Namey’s ESTF, said he would rather 
not exercise or swim in plain view of 
UC diners, but the renovations pro­
ject is largely complete, if still await­
ing a few tweaks. Hiwiller was in 
favor of the Intel move because he 
saw it as beneficial to campus.
“[The ESTF’s] mission was to eval­
uate and re-evaluate proposals for 
the layout of the rec/dining space. 
We analyzed several proposals, and 
solidified the specific vision for the 
space,” stated Namey via email. He 
now works for Student Affairs until 
he travels to Oxford to work on his 
masters in September.

Psychology professor finds that happy people also stay healthier SdTedhBriefs
Healthy volunteers infected with cold vims and quarantined in hotel to test effects of “emotional style” on health
by Karen Hoffmann
Science & Technology Editor
People who seem happy all the 
time have another reason to be 
cheerful — it turns out they’re 
healthier, too.
In last month’s issue of the journal 
Psychosomatic Medicine, a Carnegie 
Mellon professor reported that hap­
pier people are less likely to get colds 
than unhappy people. And happy 
and relaxed people don’t just get sick 
less often; when they do, they com­
plain about it 
less.
“This is the 
first study that 
measures 
emotions in 
initially 
healthy peo­
ple and finds 
that those 
who are gen­
erally happier 
are more resis­
tant to infectious disease,” said 
Sheldon Cohen, Robert E. Doherty 
Professor of Psychology. Cohen 
coauthored the study with col­
leagues from the Children’s Hospital 
of Pittsburgh, the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and 
the Medical University of South 
Carolina.
The researchers interviewed 334 
volunteers about how they felt seven 
times over three weeks to get an 
average of their “emotional style,” or
TartnSf RSarf
StolFf
disposition. The styles that the 
researchers came up with correlated 
well with those reported by the vol­
unteers themselves in a survey.
A person with a positive emotional 
style consistently rates himself as 
happy, lively, and relaxed, while 
someone with a negative style is fre­
quently sad, nervous, or angry.
The researchers then infected vol­
unteers with one of two types of cold 
virus through nasal drops. They used 
two types of virus to make sure that 
the effects they saw weren’t limited 
to one species of virus only. The vol­
unteers were quarantined for six 
days in a hotel.
“We rent an entire floor, some­
times two, of a hotel [to quarantine 
the participants],” said Cohen.
Julie Qiu/Art Staff
Why would people volunteer to get 
infected with a virus? For one thing, 
their chances of getting sick are fair­
ly low. Also, the illness was not 
severe — just a cold. And they got 
paid $800 for their trouble.
Cohen found that people with pos­
itive emotional styles got sick a third 
less often than those whose disposi­
tions were not positive. ,
He noted that a positive emotional 
style is not necessarily the opposite 
of a negative one.
“You can have someone who’s not 
happy, but that doesn’t mean they’re 
depressed or angry or anxious,” he 
said.
People with positive emotional 
styles also had lower levels of the 
stress hormones epinephrine, norep­
inephrine, and cortisol, slept better, 
and exercised more often. They also 
consumed more zinc, which Cohen’s 
team used as a marker for a healthy 
diet. If you’re hoping to change your 
“emotional style” to reap the 
immune benefits, it probably won’t 
be easy: such styles are fairly consis­
tent.
“The truth is that positive emo­
tions particularly really are a style, a 
dispositional characteristic,” said 
Cohen. “That doesn’t mean that cer­
tain situations can’t cause perturba­
tions. [But] people tend to return to 
a stable level, even after very nice 
things happen to them. There’s data, 
for example, on people who won the 
lottery: although they show this ini­
tial rise of enthusiasm, they end up 
going back to the level they started 
at.”
The best way to keep from getting 
sick is still to exercise, not smoke, eat 
a healthy diet, get the required daily 
allowance of zinc and vitamin C, get 
a good night’s sleep, and wash your 
hands, said Cohen.
And if you happen to be a happy- 
go-lucky kind of person, well, you’ll 
get an extra boost.

in). Welchia was not as commonly- 
seen, with only a few cases reported 
as of noon Friday. However, its fre­
quency did seem to be growing, so it 
will take time to see if the problem 
has been contained before the start of 
school.
Lerchey urges all users to update 
their operating systems at least once 
a week. Windows Update can be set 
to notify you when a download is 
available (and is set this way by 
default).
This helps to prevent viruses from 
taking advantage of your system, 
because most exploits, including this 
one, are known about and fixed well 
before a virus is written to take 
advantage of them.
Also, never open an attachment 
from someone you do not know, or 
any attachment that ends with .exe or 
.pif.
This is still a common method of 
virus spreading, and is easily pre­
ventable.
“You know, I’ve never heard of any­
one getting infected by a virus on 
Linux,” remarked sophomore 
mechanical engineering student and 
student consultant Walter White.

Infected Computers
Bum Lee/Art Editor
When an infected computer’s IP address is renewed, it sends the worm 
to the server, which then spreads the worm to other computers.
What to do if your computer is infected 
with the MS.Blaster or Welchia worms
If you are still on the network:
1. Download the appropriate virus 
removal tool from http://securityre- 
sponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FixBlast. 
exe for MS.Blaster, or 
http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/Fix 
Welch.exe for Welchia.
2. Download the latest service pack for 
Windows. This is Service Pack 1 for 
Windows XP, and Service Pack 4 for 
Windows 2000.
3. Get the patch which fixes the exploit 
at http://www. microsoft. com/down­
loads/details. aspx?FamilyId=C8B8A84 
6-F541-4C15-8C9F-
220354449117&displaylang=en for 
Windows 2000 and

loads/details. aspx?FamilyId=2354406 
C-C5B6-44AC-9532- 
3DE40F69C074&displaylang=en for 
Windows XP.
4. After downloading these files, dis­
connect yourself from the network.
5. If you are running Windows XP, turn
off System Restore. (This is found in 
the Control Panel, under System, then 
the System Restore tab. Check the box 
to turn it off.)6. Run the virus removal tool, then the 
Service Pack, then the patch.
7. If you turned System Restore off, 
turn it back on.8. Update your virus definitions for 
your anti-virus software.
If you have been removed from 
the network:
You have to get these files from anoth­
er source. All RAs were given a CD 
with the MS.Blaster removal tool, the 
Windows 2000 service pack, and the 
patch. If you have Windows XP, run the 
removal tool, then the patch, and ask 
the Help Center to be connected to the 
network to download the Service Pack. 
If you have Welchia, go to a cluster or 
friend’s computer and download the 
removal tool there. The fix is small 
enough to fit onto a floppy.
Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne will enthrall and surprise gamers
by Alex Meseguer
News Editor
The foul malevolence of the 
Burning Legion is cast from the land 
of Lordaeron once and for all, leav­
ing a scarred and battered land 
crawling with undead. This is the set­
ting in which players of Warcraft III: 
The Frozen Throne will start: a world 
full of unfinished business and a 
peril as great as any the Elves or 
Humans have ever known. Blizzard’s 
expansion pack to their latest install­
ment of Warcraft includes all the 
characters you loved — and loved to 
hate — in the first game and contin­
ues the dramatic epilogue to a fright­
fully chilling and surprising conclu­
sion.
The Frozen Throne is built on the
foundation of an instant classic. In 
the first issue of last year’s Tartan, I 
reviewed Warcraft III — it scored a 9 
out of 10, and the popularity of the 
game attests to the gaming world’s 
agreement. In other words, with The 
Frozen Throne, Blizzard had an uphill 
battle to outdo their own best work. 
Did they succeed? You must judge 
for yourself, but the consensus 
among gamers I have spoken to is an 
overwhelming “yes.” Only Blizzard’s 
crack (or perhaps cracked) team 
would think of putting in drunken, 
fire-breathing pandas, secret bonus 
levels, and hidden quests in the regu­
lar missions to spice up normal 
undead-bashing, in addition to new 
units and Heroes. There are also two 
new races that players will use in sin­
gle-player somewhere along their 
journey, but these races are kept out
of the multiplayer realm, presumably 
because of balancing issues.
Just when we think real-time strat­
egy games have done it all, we are 
proven wrong. With a huge set of sin- 
gle-player missions, it’s as if there’s a 
whole new game to play. Add to this 
the massive replayability of multi­
player and you have something well 
worth the $35 price tag.
Innovative gameplay elements are 
at the heart of this expansion. The 
ultimate (Level 6) ability of the new 
human hero, the Blood Mage, is to 
spawn a phoenix that burns itself 
and enemy units around it. When the 
phoenix dies, it leaves an egg behind 
that will hatch into another phoenix, 
completing the legend of the fiery 
bird that rises from its own ashes. 
Another notable spell is the ultimate 
ability of one of the new neutral
units, the Pandaren Brewmaster. Yes, 
fratboys, it’s a hero dedicated to 
imbibing large amounts of alcohol, 
with related fighting abilities. 
Included in his arsenal is dousing his 
enemies with tasty brew and then 
lighting them on fire with his fire- 
breathing ability. At Level 6, his ulti­
mate spell becomes available, allow­
ing him to split into three elemental 
pandas, each with their own unique 
fighting style. Blizzard placed heavy 
emphasis on new anti-magic units 
that are immune to magic spells and 
turn those same spells against the 
magic’s originator. The Humans’ 
Spell Breaker can take control of 
opponents’ summoned units and the 
Night Elves’ Faerie Dragon can auto­
matically damage enemy spellcasters 
when they use their abilities. The 
Undead are not left out, gaining the

ability to summon mage skeletons 
along with the usual tenants of the 
grave. They also gain a much-needed 
healing ability from the new 
Obsidian Statue unit, which has two 
possible auras: “regenerate hit 
points” or “regenerate mana.”
No Blizzard epic would be com­
plete without amazing cinematic 
cutscenes. One of the few flaws in 
the original Warcraft was that the 
player just didn’t get a sense of an 
epic struggle coming to an end, just a 
series of entangling vendettas. This 
is fixed in The Frozen Throne, with an 
ending worthy of the title that will 
chill you to your undead bones.

Gene predicts 
college drinking
College students with a certain 
gene variant drink more than those 
without it, report researchers at the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism in the current issue of 
the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism. 
Dr. Paolo DePetrillo and colleagues 
interviewed students about their 
alcohol consumption and analyzed 
their genotypes. They found that 
those who had a particular variant of 
the serotonin transporter gene (5- 
HTT) consumed more alcohol, drank 
to get drunk more often, and engaged 
in binge drinking more often. That 
variant of 5-HTT has been linked with 
anxiety, and the researchers speculat­
ed that those students with the gene 
used alcohol to reduce tension.

Power plants 
allowed to pollute
The Environmental Protection 
Agency announced last week that it 
will ease air pollution regulations for 
certain plants upgrading their equip­
ment. The nation’s dirtiest power 
plants, built in the early 1970s, will be 
covered under the changes. When the 
plants were built, it was assumed 
they would be replaced rather than 
upgraded. Under this rule, the EPA 
will allow the plants to continue oper­
ating without enforcing strict air pol­
lution regulations.
The rule would let facilities replace 
equipment without installing pollu­
tion controls as long as the cost of the 
replacement is not more than 20 per­
cent of the cost of a “process unit,” or 
entire functioning part.

THE TARTAN
UC renovations make the grade, 
Dining should take a hint, hike
UC eateries will thrive on the traffic brought 
in by the mailroom and the new rec space, 
Scotland Yard. In another masterful stroke, 
integrating the Safewalk program with the 
basement facilities bolsters both.
The success of Skibo Coffeehouse this past 
year and the initial success of Andy’s high­
light a need for attention to student input in 
all matters that concern them, but they also 
highlight another important fact: dining at 
CMU can be successful. If Andy’s continues to 
succeed like Skibo, its sister establishment, 
the University should seriously reconsider its 
outsourcing of Dining Services.
In a place as self-contained as CMU, casting 
off burdensome responsibilities to profit-hun­
gry corporations like Parkhurst seems 
counter-intuitive, especially when empirical 
evidence suggests our own people can do a 
better job.
Andy’s eatery is not a profit-seeking ven­
ture, unlike such Parkhurst establishments as 
the Grab ‘n Go or even the independent Si 
Senor. Extra monies generated by the ven­
ture's success go right back into the cafe 
rather than out of our community and into 
deep corporate pockets.
College food ventures tend to operate on an 
extremely high profit margin, according to 
Dan Barnett, coordinator of student activities 
and mastermind of Andy’s. This statement is 
clearly evidenced in the quality of the food 
that CMU students have suffered through for 
years and years, even while paying abysmally 
high prices for the stuff.
The University’s continuing attention to 
student input on the basement area and a 
renewed effort in finally fixing dining on 
campus are necessary and promised by 
University officials. Building off of the well- 
executed basement foray, these two initia­
tives will go a long way towards making CMU 
the Utopia that it has appeared to be in these 
last few days of shining Pittsburgh sun.
r Life has finally come to the once-sterile 
^University Center thanks to the diligent 
efforts of student government officials and 
¡the Division of Student Affairs. The 
(University, usually known for frugality and 
Sluggishness, has moved quickly and provid­
ed ample funds for a much-needed recre­
ational facility and healthy eatery.
The Career Center may also experience a 
renaissance in the UC, as it leaves the out-of- 
the-way basement of Warner Hall behind. 
The new student areas are spacious, well-lit, 
and apparently concordant with the enter­
tainment wants of the student body.
! In a clever piece of social engineering, a 
hew centralized mailroom will also serve as a 
magnet, mandating student use of the 
University Center, which will likely serve to 
liven up the quiet halls of the huge edifice. 
Carnegie Mellon installed over 6,000 mail­
boxes to replace an already-usable but inferi­
or system which had previously existed for 
mail, and also showed a great deal of thought 
i!n fighting for and acquiring a new zip code to 
avoid the hazards of the Pittsburgh snail mail 
infrastructure. Even off-campus students 
receive a mailbox that they may use for all 
¿heir years at school, instead of having to 
change their address each time they move.
[ The University Center is crucial to support­
ing the sometimes-forgotten non-academic 
freeds of students: the needs for fraternity, 
¿tress release, and conversation. This new 
¿pace could have a much larger impact than 
merely its entertainment value; a space for 
socialization indirectly facilitates study, fos­
ters stronger inter-student relationships, and 
even helps promote tolerance and under­
standing among diverse students by meshing 
them together in an environment more inter­
active than a classroom, 
i While a large undertaking, the renovations 
are really a fine combination of smaller plans 
that build off one another. Andy’s and other

First-years: time to shake your tailfeathers
particular school, I finally understand.
At some point, I concluded that college 
admissions tested for goodness in charity 
work and social, team, and leadership skills 
in activities. But the truth is that they want 
to know how much get up and go you have 
— they want the measure of your initiative. 
CMU measures the same way, though the 
grades will often do the trick by themselves. 
That’s how you find MIT-smart kids mulling 
their rejection on the steps of Doherty.
Take a hint from admissions; they’ve been 
there long enough to know what makes a 
successful college foray. And though you 
don’t absolutely need initiative for CMU, 
though you may not have it, it’s the new 
stratification, since all of your grades and 
test scores are close enough to be indis­
cernible. Sartre’s version of existentialism 
would say you are nothing other than your 
actions, even.
It used to be that about a quarter of stu­
dents here wouldn’t get their degree, but 
those days are long gone due to a bit of 
social engineering work by our administra­
tion. Most people can figure out how to take 
the initiative in schoolwork. It’s just boring 
and painful for many: homework, class, 
test, repeat. I’ve never seen a friend fail a
class if he did all these things, even those; 
killers like Operating Systems and’ 
Management Game. But it’s not the smarts- 
that get the grades, it’s the grind.
“School” is sort of a broader game than; 
just the work. The students who get the jobs; 
and the good recommendations hit those' 
office hours, make some noise in class, or' 
even just make conversation with profes-! 
sors. It’s a game you can play to win.
Initiative is very important in chess:; 
whole games shift in the space of a single* 
move, attacking players are generally the! 
strongest in the world, and even the com- ‘ 
puters calculate for tempo in their evalua- J 
tive functions. When the professor asks a1 
question in class, it’s an opportunity to. 
make a move, and whoever answers before! 
you has the initiative.
Initiative in groupwork, scholastic and| 
extracurricular, operates in the same fash- * 
ion. It really doesn’t matter if you have lead-! 
ership skills or not; you can seize control of ’ 
a group and gain respect merely by doing 
more than your share of the work. 
Groupmates fall into line when it’s apparent. 
they’re getting easy outs. Not that these are!
Andrew Johnson
Four years ago, when I called Donner 
dungeon my home and ECE my major, I 
must have had and heard the “Did you get 
into MIT?” discussion a handful of times. At 
Carnegie Mellon, there are a few that have 
gotten into that mythical school, but they 
are far outnumbered by the ones who 
missed the boat. Perhaps the drama plebes 
talk in hushed whispers of Juilliard the 
same way. I used to wonder why I missed 
the cut at that school — why else would I 
have involved myself in such a dumb and so 
obviously freshman conversation?
In my case, it was the extracurriculars. I 
had test scores and grades to rival anyone, 
even at MIT, but MIT didn’t think too much 
of Magic: The Gathering, especially as a 
lone activity outside of my debate club 
membership (which I joined merely to 
spend time with my girlfriend). I glowered 
at the rejection in high school, wondered at 
it in college, and now, after four years of this
CMU to students: you are 
buying our health insurance
paperwork that, should you fail to file it, will 
cost you $814.
That is not to say that offering students 
insurance is a bad idea. There are almost cer­
tainly a significant number of students who 
will benefit from the coverage, which they 
might not have been able to purchase on their 
own. But the biggest reason you should be 
getting yourself riled up as you read this piece 
is that even if you already have insurance, you 
may still be required to purchase a plan 
through CMU Health Services if your plan 
doesn’t meet certain strict requirements, such 
as a deductible of no more than $500, no less 
than $50,000 in coverage per accident or ill­
ness, guarenteed coverage of all pre-existing 
conditions, and mental health coverage.
Now, even the plan you have already pur­
chased or the one your parents have provided 
you out of pocket or through their employer 
might not suffice to save you from a mandato­
ry $814 fee, providing you with little to no 
additional benefit. It is not within the juris­
diction of any university to dictate what is and 
is not acceptable for their students’ health 
insurance, and therefore their health care. 
That is a matter for a student and his or her 
parents to decide, a matter personal and pri­
vate and certainly removed from any sort of 
regulatory influence.
The University certainly needs to work on 
disclosing those plans which directly affect 
the students in a timely and thorough man­
ner, but where health insurance is concerned 
(and this is where you, the concerned stu­
dent, come in to make some noise and beat 
the system), the University needs to recognize 
the rights of students and their parents to 
make their own decisions regarding a matter 
as personal as health care.
Time to get indignant, CMU. For the second 
time in under a year, your administrators 
have tried to pull a fast one on you. If you are 
not a first-year student, you probably remem­
ber last semester’s big ado about minors: the 
University quietly decided to remove them 
from diplomas, starting with the class of 
2003, and a lot of people, especially graduat­
ing seniors, got mad. In the end, minors made 
it back onto diplomas, and the administra­
tion, wounded, slunk back into its dark 
swamp of paperwork to contemplate its next 
move. A short time later, your student 
account was stamped with an $814 fee for a 
health insurance plan you might not have 
heard anything about until Health Services 
contacted you over the summer.
Here come your reasons for indignation, 
first, of course, there’s the ongoing issue.of 
inadequate communication. Surprises are 
tyetter left for birthday parties; having a 
¿ninor printed on one’s diploma was signifi­
cant enough to most students for a critical 
mass of the student body to protest this dele­
tion. Any college student should certainly 
want to be informed immediately of anything 
which directly affects his or her college expe­
rience, be it good or bad (especially when its 
bad).
Then, there is the matter of the waiver 
mailed out with the notification of the new 
fee, which it was required that you fill out to 
remove the presumptuous charge on your stu­
dent account. Posting the charge without 
adequately informing students before the 
academic year had ended was sloppy and 
irresponsible, something you stereotypically 
expect from the 1RS during tax season. 
Suddenly, while working the summer grind, 
you become responsible for some additional

Hasta la vista, Davis: from bad to worse
Davis is easy to blame, but the recall isn’t 
about him so much as it is about other dem­
agogues trying to steal his position. Pardon 
my cynicism, but the fact that California 
Congressman Darrell Issa, a Republican, 
Michael Croland initiated and funded the recall process 
against Davis, a Democrat, makes me ques­
tion his altruism and loyalty to the state he 
serves. His recall campaign stank of selfish 
intentions for personal advancement.
I tip my hat in pity to Issa, though, as the 
melee that ensued from his efforts led to his 
backing out of the race. A whopping 135 
candidates are officially aspiring to be the 
new governor of California in October’s 
recall election, and Issa isn’t one of them.
One candidate’s chief platform is the 
legalization of ferrets as pets. There’s a 100- 
year-old woman whose five-year plan is not 
to die. Even candidates with the same 
names as Michael Jackson and Bob Dole are 
running! There’s a professional boxer, a 
sumo wrestler, and a partridge in a pear 
tree.
Let’s move from the obscure and absurd 
to the well-known and absurd. “Serious” 
candidates include the publisher of Hustler, 
a buxom billboard model, a bunch of politi­
cos that simply aren’t interesting, a punk 
rocker, and a potpourri of comedians and 
actors.
This batch of wackos is not a new phe­
nomenon regarding the legitimacy of politi­
cians’ credentials. It’s a symptom of a trend 
in place throughout the last 20 years.
If former pro wrestler Jesse “The Body” 
Ventura was able to serve as governor of 
Minnesota, then we can accept California’s 
credibility-impaired candidates. Even as
presidents, we’ve had Ronald Reagan, the 
former actor, Bill Clinton, the ultimate hus­
tler, and George W. Bush, the perpetual 
jester.
Personally, I find Jack Grisham to be the 
most intriguing of the quasi-serious candi­
dates. He’s been the frontman for Orange 
County punk rockers TSOL sporadically 
since 1979 and refuses to admit that his 
campaign is a publicity stunt for the band’s 
new album. When asked if he’d ever been 
convicted of a felony, he proudly told MTV 
News, “Well, never convicted!”
When not punking out, he works as a 
laborer, “just anything with a shovel,” as he 
explained it to the L.A. Times. His personal 
lack of decent healthcare coverage has 
inspired true concern for California’s 
healthcare system. Grisham is tired of being 
a ne’er-do-well and is willing to bring about 
improvement for Californians. He’s already 
turned down CNN for an interview in order 
to distinguish himself from the rest of the 
attention-hungry pack. Vote Jack Grisham 
and elect change, integrity, and the “True 
Sounds of Liberty.”
The most shockingly serious of the com­
petition is Arnold Schwarzenegger. The for­
mer bodybuilder and prominent actor is the 
most likely to win, and support behind him 
is one of the main reasons that Issa backed 
out.
Schwarzenegger does raise doubts aplen­
ty. He’s married to an adamant Democrat, 
which makes one reconsider his partisan 
allegiance, and most obviously, the legiti­
macy of Schwarzenegger’s candidacy must
THE TARTAN“CALIFORNIA IN CRISIS,” screamed the 
cover of Newsweek earlier this summer. The 
economic and political situation in 
California does indeed seem preposterous. 
We must, however, observe it not only as 
altruistically-minded spectators, but also 
out of concern for its microcosmic relevance 
to our country’s current predicament.
Our nation’s largest state has an economy 
greater than all but four nations and an 
overwhelming deficit of $38 billion. One 
needn’t be a Marxist to cite economics as 
the main foundation for the current debacle 
in California. The federal budget deficit will 
reach $400 billion this year, and perhaps we 
should take heed of a California that seems 
more likely than ever to drop off into the 
sea.
Governor Gray Davis was reelected less 
than a year ago. He was in charge during 
California’s abysmal descent, but he isn't 
entirely to blame. Even though the financial 
crisis wasn’t fully disclosed at the time of 
the regular election, basic confidence in 
elected officials begs that we give him more 
leeway than the short period since his 
reelection. If we relied on California’s 
deficit as the sole excuse to justify recalling 
Davis, then 46 other governors would also 
need to be recalled. This logic puts all the 
blame on isolated individuals when wide­
spread economic woes are commonplace.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled and photos by Jeff Cullers;
Dam Pascocello
The other story behind this summer’s groundbreaking and much- 
; delayed anti-sodomy Supreme Court ruling, besides its implications for 
| future consensual arrangements, sexual or otherwise, involved the coming 
; together of hitherto disparate political factions. In Lawrence v. Texas, the 
i rallying cry was heard by Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conser- 
i vatives alike. “Right-leaning” groups like the Institute for Justice and the 
i Cato Institute aligned with lefty strongholds such as People for the 
\ American Way and the ACLU, with Cato’s libertarian scholars filing an ami­
cus brief on behalf of the two gay petitioners in the case. The reason for the 
¦ ideological coalescence rested on nothing less than the future of govern- 
! ment’s search and seizure powers and the interpretation of privacy rights 
I in this country. In the end, the Court decided — rightly — that the Fourth 1 Amendment’s proscription on “unreasonable search and seizure” should be 
' upheld, despite the moral objections of specific communities, or else the 
! “right of people to be secure in their persons” would be little more than 
; wishful thinking, and open to arbitrary enforcement or debasement. 
Moreover, the vast majority of pundits I observed in printed and televised 
media lauded the decision as a victory not just for homosexuals but for 
Americans generally, reversing the High Court’s Bowers case of 17 years 
| earlier, when it upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy fiat.
Come to think of it, just about the only people who didn’t appreciate the 
ruling were a gaggle of Lone Star State hillbillies on a power trip and 
Christian conservatives like Rick Santorum, who apparently view any sex 
act outside the missionary position as a threat to homeland security. In his 
dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia accused the Court of largely “signing on” to 
the gay agenda. A point that may deserve more consideration than the flip­
pant dismissal Maureen Dowd gave it in a recent New York Times op-ed, 
yes, but unfortunately Justice Scalia misses the import of this case. The 
anti-sodomy lawsuit involved private rights, whereas gay marriage or some 
suitable variant deals more with public rights, something far afield of the 
property rights violations inherent in the Lawrence case. When the issue of 
gay marriage surfaces on the federal court level — and it must — all slip­
pery slope debates may then have free rein; for now, the facts at issue deal 
with a “reasonable expectation” of personal privacy, nothing more.
The above illustrates two points: the near universality of support for pri­
vacy rights as something unique to the American experience; and addition­
ally, the fear that an overemphasis on privacy may have unintended (ill) 
effects. Indeed, we live in an increasingly dissonant society when it comes 
to information about ourselves and others. This is partly the result of our 
Internet age — fraud and identity theft appear much simpler when the 
means to commit such crimes are but a few keystrokes away. Most people 
decry spam and data-driven marketing like Amazon.corn’s customer track­
ing, but clam up on the subject of Social Security numbers or motor vehicle 
registration. Private bad, government good; the ramifications of such 
thinking can be found in the European Union, where so-called “opt-in” 
rules are mandatory for private companies and non-profit organizations 
and have eliminated or severely cut back on the direct marketing and data 
gathering in which these groups engage. The effect has been a sustained 
slide in the areas of charitable and political donations, arising in part 
because Europeans no longer receive solicitations through the mail or by 
Internet, save for the handful who have signed the written consent forms 
allowing it. Americans are even more covetous of their privacy than these 
! European diehards, making the recent developments in electronic commu- 
, nication so perplexing.
Unless you’ve been living in a Defense Department-approved fallout 
shelter over the summer, you’ve perchance had someone tell you about
• Friendster. Friendster.com is a network of peer-to-peer connections similar 
to Shawn Fanning’s Napster music service, minus the Weezer uploads (and
; legal action). It’s a kind of six degrees of separation for the mall set, where 
; users who post profiles and photos are connected to others in their own
• network, friends’ networks, and so on. Weblogs, which have been around 
i far longer than Friendster, serve as online diaries, editorial pages, and, in 
! not a few cases, manifestos, and have a much more personal quality than
; the user-approved shield afforded by Friendster’s networking. So why are 
; people so willing to splash their innermost secrets all over the web, or seek
• serious relationships with folks they know little more of than what they’ve 
! read on a testimonial?1 In an era of nasties like the Pentagon’s Terrorist Information Awareness 
I" (TIA), this kind of communitarianism doesn’t seem to fit. But services like 
j Friendster and “blogging” can rely on technological safeguards to dispense 
- information selectively, to users of their choosing. As technology continues 1 to outpace and nullify legislative measures (such as the failed 
Communications Decency Act) government has relied ever more on aping 1 private sector innovation. Enter the above-mentioned TIA as well as pro- 
i jects such as LifeLog, a planned surveillance tool that gathers pictures of 
' individuals out of a mosaic of data. Sometime soon, the Supreme Court 
.may hear another privacy case. Chances are good this one may not feature 
federal agents or property rights, but instead hinge on an esoteric set of 
•technological details beyond the understanding of the Rehnquist court. At 
that time, our “reasonable expectation of privacy,” sacrificed for an online 
tryst or simply blogged away, might be less immediately definable, and, as 
' a result, underdefended.

What did you think about Playfair?
Diversity ruling doesn’t fix problem
Adam Greenberg
Fairly achieved diversity for the 
sake of diversity is a compelling inter­
est for the state of Michigan. That rul­
ing, which came down in the 
Supreme Court case Gratz v. Bollinger 
in June, unfortunately agrees with 
the majority opinion of the precedent 
case, Regents of the University of 
California v. Bakke, on how affirma­
tive action may be used in education­
al admissions programs. The court 
claims that, so long as the University 
of Michigan reviews individual 
minority applications before granting 
them admission as an exception to 
their general pool, they may legally 
give such special admissions. The 
question remains, though, whether 
any program using racial or ethnic 
factors can actually fairly achieve 
diversity.
Michigan’s admissions procedures 
and records for both undergraduate 
liberal arts and graduate law stu­
dents were scrutinized simultaneous­
ly in search of evidence of preferen­
tial treatment over the last decade for 
minority students. According to for­
mer justice Lewis Powell’s opinion in 
1978’s Bakke case, diversity may be 
used as a criteria for admissions pro­
vided that a quota system is not 
applied.
However, while the University of 
Michigan had not applied a true 
quota system, the current court ruled
that its undergraduate College of 
Literature, Arts, and Sciences had 
violated Powell’s directive that the 
system for awarding extra benefits to 
minorities be “narrowly tailored” and 
individualized.
This ruling follows from an exami­
nation of the University’s undergrad­
uate admissions protocol. Applying 
students are given an opportunity to 
earn as many as 150 “points” toward 
admission, which is granted uncondi­
tionally with 100 points, and may be 
offered with fewer. While key factors 
in admissions were given low point 
values, such as 10 for being a 
Michigan resident and one point for 
an outstanding essay, 20 points were 
given indiscriminately merely for 
being a member of an “underrepre­
sented minority,” a point value equiv­
alent to one point in a candidate’s
Bum Lee/Art Editor
GPA and which also represents more 
points than one can receive for per­
fect college board examination 
scores.
The implication in the Gratz case 
was that, while so-called “minimally 
qualified” minority students were 
being admitted, the well-qualified 
(but Caucasian) Jennifer Gratz and 
her qualified (but Caucasian) co-peti- 
tioner Patrick Hamacher — both 
Michigan residents — were denied 
admission.
In its majority opinion (written by 
chief justice William Rehnquist), the 
court expressed the view that 
Michigan’s system is in violation of 
the Equal Protection Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI
See DIVERSITY, page A12California recall election is a farce
be questioned for his having 
announced he’d run on The Tonight 
Show with Jay Leno and for using 
sound-bytes like “hasta la vista, 
baby,” aimed at the incumbent. Like 
it or not, his warm image in the press 
will probably dictate his victory.
At least Schwarzenegger is mount­
ing a commendable campaign; other 
candidates seem to be running on 
autopilot. Actor Gary Coleman, of 
Diffrent Strokes fame, is a candidate 
in the rat-race, despite showing sup­
port for Schwarzenegger,. “I’m going 
to stay in the race, but I’m not going 
to campaign,” Coleman told CNN. 
Just how seriously can we view this 
election when so-called serious can­
didates do not commit to campaign­
ing?
Larry Flynt, the publisher of 
Hustler and a “smut peddler who 
cares,” had similar apathy: “If the
support is there, I am willing to go 
the distance. If not, I will fade into 
the sunset,” he told Reuters.
Before Schwarzenegger or any of 
the others conquer California, how­
ever, the recall election must actually 
recall Davis. If less than half of the 
electorate chooses to boot Davis on 
the same ballot as all the new candi­
dates, then he will stay in power.
If California is to maintain any 
trace of stability, Davis must remain 
governor. The recall election is a 
waste of much-needed funds and an 
impatient attack against a governor 
who was just reelected.
At a time when many people across 
the globe question the integrity of the 
United States, the California disaster 
has only made us more of a laughing­
stock. The Guardian, a respectable 
but very left-wing British newspaper, 
recently explained the recall process 
as having “turned into farce, reinforc­
ing the old stereotype of California as
CALIFORNIA, from page A10
Kohta Asakura/Art Staff
the home of Goofy.”
Frankly, I couldn’t agree more. The 
California recall election is as ludi­
crous as many of its major candidates’ 
resumes. A state cannot achieve sta­
bility by robbing itself of funds and 
trying to get rid of its recently- 
reelected leader. The recall process is 
unquestionably a “farce,” and the 
pathetic way it is taking advantage of 
a vulnerable California only furthers 
the world’s mockery of us.
If we fail to stand united against 
the political cannibalism that threat­
ens the stability of our union, we will 
fare in accordance with the new 
album title of Jack Grisham’s TSOL: 
Divided We Fall.
Michael Croland (mic@) is a junior 
with a double-major in creative and 
professional writing and a minor in 
religious studies. He’s jealous of Jack 
Grisham for getting to sing backup 
vocals on the new Offspring album.

conviction for curfew violation citing 
that order 9066 was in violation of 
the Fourteenth Amendment as a per­
son’s ancestry (and therefore his 
race) may not be used as the sole 
characterization of that person. The 
University of Michigan was using 
applicants’ races to categorize them 
in such a way that nearly all minimal­
ly-qualified minority applicants were 
being admitted ipso facto.
Although the Supreme Court 
moved in the right direction, toward 
the elimination of special “affirma­
tive action” treatment for minorities, 
the final decision in the case marked 
the loss of an opportunity for the 
nation’s high court to completely 
undo the mistakes of their predeces­
sors. While six of the nine members 
of the court in 1978 (of whom only 
Rehnquist and associate justice John 
Paul Stevens remain) were conserva­
tives or right-leaning centrists, popu­
lar pressure forced the decision to 
allow affirmative action to remain 
legal.
This past June, with conservatives 
and centrists still commanding the 
court, the justices did not assert that 
such discrimination should be elimi­
nated entirely, ensuring that 
Rehnquist, Stevens, and some of their 
aging associates may finish their 
careers with a display of judiciary 
impotency.

a heterogeneous student body is 
being favored over the admission of 
the most qualified applicants. Thus, 
despite the fact that diversity is a 
compelling reason for their discrimi­
nation, they ruled that the 
University’s methods of achieving 
diversity are inherently flawed. In a 
society in which many view color­
blindness as an achieveable goal, we 
must not continue to allow random 
factors like race to determine major 
decisions. If the University is claiming 
its discrimination is in the name of 
their cause of diversity, how can they 
justify giving points merely for being 
in a racial minority? Is a person who 
was subject to the exact same 
upbringing as Gratz or Hamacher but 
is black or Hispanic more than mar­
ginally diverse? According to a feder­
al court in Seattle, those seeking to 
cultivate diversity must look beyond 
race.

Defense rusty in exhibition versus Westminster
by Preston Treichel
Staffwriter
On Saturday the Tartans kicked off the grid­
iron season by hosting a scrimmage with the 
Westminster Titans at Gesling Stadium. The reg­
ular season commences on September 6.
The scrimmage was divided into four parts. 
The first part consisted of the teams starting their 
offense on the 40-yard line and imitating a game­
like situation for two 15-minute quarters. After 
that, the teams went on to practice goal-line 
offense, scoring in less than two minutes, and 
ended with special teams practice.
Both Westminster and CMU started out strong 
on offense. Marching down the field, they scored
Senior wideout Chris Kay leaps for a pass against a 
Westminster defender.
on their respective first attempts. Westminster 
connected with a loft pass to the corner of the 
end zone, and CMU with a short plunge.
However, the second drive was a different 
story, as Westminster was able to score again 
while CMU turned the ball over with a fumble.
Westminster continued to eat up the CMU 
defense in the next drive, with a couple long runs 
that finally resulted in another touchdown. CMU 
was successful with their third attempt as well, 
pounding the ball into the Titan territory until 
they hit paydirt.
On the fourth and final attempt for 
Westminster, the CMU defense was able to stop 
them cold. The Tartans’ fourth attempt was cut 
short due to time.
Although there were some bright spots in the 
scrimmage, head coach Rich Lackner said the 
Tartans still have a fair amount of improvements 
to make. Perhaps the most notable area to work 
on was the CMU run defense.
“We’re going to work on the basics,” said 
Lackner. “I’m talking about shedding blocks, 
wrapping up when we tackle, that sort of thing. If 
we do that, we can eliminate a lot of mistakes.”
The defense was not the only spot to be called 
to attention, however. During the two-minute 
drill, the CMU offense was unable to surmount 
one first down in two attempts. Although the 
offensive line was getting a good push all day, the 
hurry-up offense did not fare as well as the clas­
sic Tartan ground game.
“We just started working on the two-minute 
drill a couple days ago in practice,” said Lackner. 
“In our second two-minute drill, we got sacked on 
second down and that killed us. There’s not much 
you can do on third and 20.”
This year, the Tartans are a younger team and 
the scrimmage helped get a little experience 
under everyone’s belt. Lackner realizes the 
importance of the scrimmage and is remaining 
optimistic about the rest of the season.
“The lads put forth a great effort out there,” 
said Lackner. “We’ve only had about ten days of 
practice. Mistakes are expected, now all we have 
to do is look at the tapes and see what we need to 
improve on.”

Last meeting: In last year’s opening game,

the Tartans dominated the game on defense, 
holding the Bison to but one touchdown late 
in the game while the CMU offense scored 21 
fourth-quarter points for the 31-9 victory. 
CMU leads the all-time series 27-6.
The skinny: The Bison will be trying to 
improve on their 3-7 record last year, but 
despite returning 18 starters, they are ailing 
at two key offensive positions, with QB 
Jeremy Lacaria and RB Will Anderson, the 
PAC player of the year, having graduated. 
Their defense will still be solid, particularly 
the depth in their defensive secondary.

Baylor implicated 
in wrongful death
HOUSTON (AP) — Efforts by 
Baylor athlete Patrick Dennehy to 
expose wrongdoing in the universi­
ty’s basketball program resulted in 
“violent threats” against him and a 
cover-up that led to his murder, the 
player’s father said in a wrongful- 
death lawsuit filed Friday.
“Despite his best efforts, Patrick’s 
fears became reality on or about June 
16, 2003, when he was lured to his 
death by another Baylor basketball 
player and ultimately silenced forev­
er,” lawyers for Patrick Dennehy Sr. 
said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified dam­
ages and names Baylor University, 
former basketball coach Dave Bliss, 
school President Robert Sloan, for­
mer athletic director Tom Stanton, 
and others associated with the pro­
gram and the school.
Dennehy disappeared in mid-June, 
and his body was found in a field out­
side Waco on July 25. He had been 
shot twice in the head.
His former teammate and room­
mate Carlton Dotson has been 
charged with murder and is jailed in 
Maryland, awaiting the outcome of 
extradition proceedings that would 
return him to Texas for trial.
Fallout from the case — including 
allegations of improper payments to 
players — cost Bliss and Stanton their 
jobs, ravaged the Baylor basketball 
program, and prompted an internal 
inquiry by Baylor into possible NCAA 
violations. NCAA penalties could 
affect the school’s athletic program 
for years.
Bobby Bonds dies 
at age 57 of illness
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Bobby 
Bonds, one of the first major leaguers 
to blend home-run power with base- 
stealing speed and the father of one 
of baseball’s greatest sluggers, died 
Saturday. He was 57.
Barry Bonds’s father had been ill 
for nearly a year with lung cancer and 
a brain tumor, but he never lost his 
love for baseball. He was at Pacific 
Bell Park on Wednesday night, watch­
ing his superstar son and the San 
Francisco Giants.
Bobby Bonds died shortly before 9 
am PDT, a Giants spokesman said. 
Barry Bonds will be away from the 
team indefinitely.
Bobby Bonds, a three-time All-Star 
and the MVP of the 1973 game, hit 
332 home runs and stole 461 bases 
for the Giants, New York Yankees, 
California Angels, Chicago White 
Sox, Texas, Cleveland, St. Louis and 
the Chicago Cubs.
He began his career with a bang, 
hitting a grand slam in his first game 
on June 25,1968. He is the only play­
er in the modern era to accomplish 
that feat.
Duce Staley and 
Eagles agree to talk
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — 
Philadelphia Eagles running back 
Duce Staley flew into Philadelphia on 
Saturday afternoon, an indication 
that he might be ending his 27-day 
holdout.
Staley, who is entering his seventh 
NFL season and led the Eagles in 
rushing last season, has been fined 
$5,000 for each day of the holdout, 
for a total of $135,000.
He is in the final year of a contract 
that will pay him $2.2 million this 
season.
Earlier this month, Staley released 
a statement criticizing Eagles man­
agement for not “seriously” dis­
cussing his future with the team. 
Staley pressed for an extension and 
said he wanted to finish his career 
with the team.
Relations between the Eagles and 
Staley thawed a bit last week, with 
Coach Andy Reid meeting at least 
twice with Staley’s agent, Derrick 
Harrison.
Staley rushed for 1,029 yards and 
five touchdowns last year and also 
had 541 yards and three touchdowns 
receiving.

Another year at Carnegie Mellon 
is upon us, and the air hanging over 
the campus I’ve come to know and 
like-slightly-more reeks of excite­
ment, nervousness, and the per­
fume of those delightfully unpre­
pared first-year ladies. From the 
seasoned CMU campaigners prepar­
ing for another round with the 
University to the huddled masses of 
children knocking down the doors 
of Morewood and New House, we 
all feel the looming presence of 
something greater than we could 
ever be: the 2003 NFL Season. 
That’s right, yinz, it’s back: the hits, 
the catches, the runs, the fans, and, 
of course, the beer are about to 
come crashing into our living 
rooms, and it’s about time.
During the entertainment-void 
portion of the year known as the 
off-season, I and other football cra­
zies have been left small tidbits of 
player news and transactions to sat­
isfy our appetite for the NFL. When 
San Diego stole David Boston from 
Arizona to upgrade their offense, 
we could smell it: the sweet aroma 
of gridiron drama rising in the 
western sky and drifting its way 
across the country. We were further 
teased by Buffalo, which sent 
Peerless Price to Atlanta, upgrading 
their woeful defense with the 
money they freed up. The Bills and 
Falcons became contenders; foot­
ball fans greeted the move with 
raised eyebrows and anticipation 
for the changes to come. Finally, 
pre-season football has begun, leav­
ing us salivating for the real thing.
As fantasy owners and Falcons 
fans across the nation tear their 
hair out over the loss of Mike Vick, 
the rest of us prepare for another 
year, mystery and intrigue hanging 
thicker than the Pittsburgh fog.
Can anyone beat Tampa Bay? Is 
the Tuna the answer in Dallas? 
What the hell was ESPN thinking 
when they hired Rush Limbaugh as 
the “voice of the fan” on Sunday 
NFL Countdown? And how bout 
them Stillers?
I don’t pretend to know the 
answers to these questions, but 
because I am a football columnist, I 
get to take a shot with my predic­
tions for the upcoming year. First 
question: yes, someone can beat 
Tampa Bay. The Bucs are once 
again strong, probably even better 
than last year, but they are not 
unbeatable. I predict that Gruden’s 
offense will let the team down this 
year, but not until the Super Bowl. 
The Bucs should make it out of the 
NFC unless they choke (which, up 
until last season, they excelled at), 
but that second Lombardi Trophy 
will elude them.
Bill Parcels in Dallas poses an 
interesting situation. The Cowboys 
were once America’s Team and I 
hated them. Now they suck but 
have a proven winner for a coach.
My guess is fairly obvious: they will 
not do a complete 180 this year; 
they don’t have the talent running 
the show at QB. However, after a 
couple of years, the Cowboys will 
be back in the Super Bowl hunt, 
and once again I will hate them.
About Rush Limbaugh, I have 
nothing to say. Okay, that’s a lie, I 
have a lot to say, just nothing posi­
tive to say. Before I begin, allow me 
to say that I do not like sports 
broadcasters. As a skinny white kid, 
it is obvious that I have long dreamt 
of football (or any other sports) 
glory. Why? Because I love the 
game? Hell no, I can love the game 
without possessing any talent. I 
want football talent and size 
because of the easy money. I would 
love to have my life and career 
based on a game, instead of work­
ing my ass off to make money when 
I graduate. Sports broadcasters 
have the same talent level I have, 
yet they make loads of easy money 
doing what I do between home­
work assignments; they simply 
watch the game and talk about it. I 
hate them, but I digress.
Now, about Limbaugh, I also hate 
him. The last thing the sports world 
needs is another arrogant windbag. 
And, pray tell, what fans does he 
represent? I will personally change 
all my beliefs and opinions as a fan 
simply so I can disagree with him. 
I’m sick of ESPN trying so damn 
hard to entertain people —just give 
us the sports. I doubt a bunch of
people who hate football will tune 
in on Sunday mornings simply to 
hear Uncle Rush speak on their 
behalf. God, please make me a pro­
ducer so all my bad ideas can turn 
into network gold.
Finally, our beloved Stillers. How 
will the boys here in the ‘Burgh per­
form? My guess is they will have an 
even better year than last year. 
Their defense is okay, good enough 
to get them into the postseason 
anyway, but their offense will carry 
them this year. Tommy Maddox is a 
gift from the land of forgotten QBs, 
and the receiving corps of Hines 
Ward and Plaxico Burress is one of 
the best in the league. Pittsburgh 
should win the division, but it will 
not be easy. Kelly Holcomb starting 
in Cleveland means a high-powered 
attack from the Browns, and 
Baltimore’s defense is once again 
sick with the return of Ray Lewis 
and the arrival of the rookie Terrell 
Suggs. The AFC North will be a 
dogfight, but look for the Steelers 
to emerge at the head of the pack 
when all is said and done.
But enough of my nonsense for 
this week, kiddies. Tune in next 
time for official breakdowns of the 
key divisions in the league and 
some more of my football- and 
beer-related rants. Good luck with 
the first week of school.

Mediocrity might as well be be a 
four-letter word for the Carnegie 
Mellon football team. No doubt there 
are many expletives unleashed in the 
CMU locker room. But none more 
ear-splitting and offensive than that 
which means “average” after CMU 
finished 5-5 in 2002, snapping a 
string of 27 consecutive seasons with 
a winning record. The Tartans’ UAA 
conference schedule becomes more 
unforgiving every year, as schools 
like the University of Chicago and 
Washington University find ways to 
spend more bucks on “academic” 
and “character” scholarships for star 
football players. Below are three of 
the most pressing issues for the 
Tartans in 2003, withstanding the 
abysmal state of funding for the 
University’s athletic program.
Will a new scheme revive a porous 
2002 defense?
Pittsburgh football is smashmouth 
football. On offense, run the football 
and control the clock. On defense, 
pulverize the opposing team’s quar­
terback, running back, and wide 
receivers with the fury of a tsunami. 
Last season, the defense allowed 
nearly 200 yards passing and a most 
uncharacteristic 109 yards rushing 
per game. A confounded Terry 
Bodnar, a defensive coordinator even 
Buddy Ryan would like, went to the 
drawing board. He came back with a 
3-3-5 (or 3-5-3), a defense that takes 
advantage of the team’s depth in the 
secondary. The defense will bring 
pressure from strong safety, where 
first-years Aaron Lewis and Drew 
Serty will vie for playing time with 
sophomore Tom Pfister, a convert 
from linebacker, and senior Paul 
Shubert, a player who has been in 
more positions than Jenna Jamison. 
Senior free safety Joe Ciccarelli 
could be the best centerfielder in 
Pittsburgh since Andy Van Slyke.
He’ll partner with one of three 
Adams: Bowland, Lovorich, or Wirth 
— who may be the fiercest hitter on 
the team.
Junior Phil Clingman moves from 
defensive end to nose tackle. 
Clingman is a 6’4”, 265-pound beast. 
Last season, offenses ran away from 
Clingman. This year, he’ll be like a 
giant Sequioa in in the middle, com­
plimented by defensive tackles junior 
Pat Marcotte and sophomore Brant 
Hampton.
How will quarterback Jarrod 
Highberger respond after a dismal 
rookie year?
Highberger was thrust into the QB 
position after senior Sebastian 
Smelko was injured and senior Robb 
Finkey publicly clashed with offen­
sive coordinator Rich Erdelyi. 
Highberger’s inexperience showed; 
he threw eight interceptions versus 
one touchdown and had an efficency 
rating of 66.0. Highberger is now 
slimmer, faster, and more learned.
Highberger has a formidable 
offensive line in front of him. All­
conference offensive lineman Chad 
Zimmerman enters his senior season 
with a clean bill of health for the 
first time in his career. Since the 
Tartans pull their guards to block on 
sweep runs, the more agile senior 
David Stein will play right guard. 
Sophomore Christian Guirnalda will 
take over at Stein’s former spot, right 
tackle. Replacing graduated center 
Bob Barton and left tackle Brandon 
Foth are the largest CMU offensive 
linemen, senior Ryan Plusch and 
junior Jacob Denne.
Can the running game continue 
to rumble over opponents?
Highberger will only flourish if his 
offensive line can establish the run­
ning game, a likely proposition. 
Senior halfback Ricardo Clarke is 
CMU’s best offensive weapon and 
must stay healthy (he sat out 
Saturday’s scrimmage with a ham­
string injury, but should be fine in 
two weeks for the opener against 
Bethany). Junior fullback Brad 
Stanley (“Steamer”) should have lit­
tle trouble replacing touchdown spe­
cialist Adam Urbanczyk. Stanley 
averaged 71 yards rushing per game.
As usual, it’s a talent-laced roster, 
but the question is where the players 
line up. When the Tartans face 
Bethany in two weeks, they will have 
a new-look defense, new “wrinkles” 
in the offense, and a competent spe­
cial teams unit. But is it just makeup, 
or a real face lift?

Guzman vs. the Rock
A tale of man against mineral in the mountainous regions of West Virginia
On the stretched-out roads that head towards 
Coopers Rock State Park, West Virginia, 
Lindsay Marler, the carpool driver, said, “And 
oh yeah, you need to wear a helmet, because, 
you know, sometimes people fall.”
An image of people falling like sacks of pota­
toes entered my mind....
Slowly I asked, “Do people fall often?”
“Well, yeah,” she replied with no problem.
How I got into this, I don’t know, but while 
my fellow students were probably recuperating 
from a festive Friday night, I walked through a 
quiet and slow college campus to get to the car­
pool that would take me rock climbing. The 
only catch was that I had to arrive at the car­
pool at 7:30 am. I hailed a cab to guarantee my 
punctuality.
The clever cabbie asked me what a college 
student was doing awake at such a wee hour. I 
told him about the rock and West Virginia, and 
he said, entirely amazed, “You’re driving two 
hours to climb a rock?”
Sometimes it’s the big effort for the little 
things that makes life worth living. In the taxi, I 
naturally thought of those car ads they bom­
bard you with on TV. I could see it long before 
it even happened. I would wear my shorts, be 
connected to a harness, skillfully climb my 
mountain, and then, maybe, for doing such a 
good job, I would get a sports car like the ones 
on TV.
Yet my prizes will have to wait... for my mus­
cles to grow. Seriously, though, you do not need 
huge muscles to climb a rock, although it would 
not hurt. All you need is technique, a sense of 
the terrain, and good rubber shoes (a.k.a. 
climbing shoes).
The main instructor for us beginners was a 
pleasant, laid-back guy by the name of “Bill.” 
He wore a bandanna motorcycle-style. I, for 
one, dug the sincere, no-nonsense way he told 
us how to put on our equipment. Still, I had 
trouble doing it.
We had to put our legs through these little 
hoops. I wondered if it was supposed to be so 
uncomfortable. I asked one of the “advanced 
climbers,” who said, “Oh, you have it on back­
wards.”
The group of beginners included a few cou­
ples, a couple of Pitt students, and a family of 
four: 10 in total. The class takes you from safe­
ty to belaying to the formal calls between the 
climber and belayer. Just like weight-lifters 
need their buddies to “spot” them and make 
sure they don’t drop 300 pounds on their 
chests, rock climbers need belayers.
While the climber is on the rock working 
their way up, a “buddy” is giving them less or 
more rope to work with — think of a pulley sys­
tem — depending on their need for mobility, 
balance, and motion.
Everyone did a great job. The long-legged, 
long-armed attendees moved up the 30-foot 
rock like seasoned pros; some took a more con­
servative pace, and everyone did well. I won­
dered how the two young girls from the family, 
aged 12 and 13, would fare. They both did real­
ly well for their age, and soon enough it was my 
turn.
The class took two to four minutes on average 
to get up the rock, and 15 seconds to get down. 
You don’t climb down, but walk with your legs 
stretched parallel to the ground, Batman-style 
(the ’60s TV series, not the ’90s films).
So, I saw myself getting up quickly. Well, I 
took 20 minutes to get up and 40 seconds to get 
down. By wearing two-year-old shoes, I lacked 
a lot of the grip that rock climbers rely on, so I 
used my upper body, which you’re not really 
encouraged to do because it tires you out.
Skateboarders will tell you that once you 
skateboard, sidewalks are never the same. I feel 
the same way about 30-foot rocks for the 
moment. I had a great time and did some rock 
climbing, the kind you neither do nor see on 
those TV ads. I got the feel of the terrain, the 
feel of a hand gripping in cracks in the rock, 
pushing against gravity to keep your body close 
to the mountain, and that adrenaline rush of 
not falling off like a sack of potatoes.
The Western Pennsylvania Field Institute has 
been around for only two years, founded in 
spring of 2001 as a non-profit nature and out­
door sports organization with the same conser- 
vationalist spirit and love of adventure that 
started in this country before the turn of the 
century with naturalist John Muir.
Offerings tend to be both moderately physi­
cal and educational and range from rock climb­
ing to wilderness survival, bike trips, backpack­
ing, kayaking, and much more. Some classes 
take the day off from outdoor exertion and 
focus instead on the quiet appreciation and 
fierce preservation of nature through disci­
plines like photography and media skills.
Its beginner’s classes, like this one, are 
designed to both challenge and accommodate 
the enthusiastic novice, and because the 
Institute struggles to recruit young, active peo­
ple, they pay special attention to beginners.

CARNEGIE 
ALMANAC
50 YEARS AGO
September 22, 1953 — Morewood Gardens, then an all­
female dorm, had trouble with overcrowding. In preparation 
for the school year, rooms enough for 28 women had been 
created out of old storage and utility rooms. This left the 
total capacity at 429. Occupancy figures for the co-ed dorm 
now stand at 677, partly due to Morewood E-Tower, which 
was constructed in 1961.
25 YEARS AGO
September 5, 1978 — Mellon Bank opened its first 
Customer Bank Communications Terminal, or CBCT, in 
Skibo. The machine, better known now as a MAC or ATM, 
was the first on a college campus in Pennsylvania. It was 
installed to save students the trouble of walking four blocks 
to the nearest branch office and used “plastic cards" to 
operate. Citizens took over Mellon’s personal banking oper­
ations last year.

August 30, 1993 — On the first day of classes, new tennis 
courts were opened between Skibo and Margaret Morrison. 
The courts, the last of which had just gotten the final coat 
on its surface the week before, preceded the demolition of 
Skibo and the construction of the new University Center. A 
tunnel was planned to link the new building to Margaret 
Morrison.
5 YEARS AGO
August 31, 1998 — First-year students coming to campus 
for orientation were greeted by construction on what is now 
the Purnell Center for the Arts. The prior year there had 
only been a hole in the ground next to Warner. Purnell was 
the last of the buildings in the campus Master Plan that 
included the construction of the University Center, Gesling 
Stadium, and the parking garage. The Purnell Center was 
completed and open for classes in the fall of 1999.
1 YEAR AGO
August 26, 2002 — Lambda Phi Epsilon had its first 
recruiting event, or “rush." The greek organization, newly 
recognized on campus, sprang from the Brotherhood of 
Asian-American Men. LPE had 17 members at the start of 
the school year. Pi Delta Psi was also beginning its first 
year as a recognized organization, and now has 18 broth­
ers. The two, along with Kappa Phi Lambda, are classified 
as CMU’s only "multicultural colonies."

The Funny Bone
Local talent Bill Scott bests Jeff Shaw
Bill Scott, local comedian: “What the fuck are you 
writing out there?”
Me: “A review.”
Scott: “Don’t write my shit down. I’ll bounce this 
fucking beer bottle off your head.”
Me: (apologetic, bewildered look)
Scott: “And don’t think I couldn’t do it, cause that ‘fro 
makes the perfect fuckin’ target.”
After paying $5 to park, I walked about a block and a 
half through the culture mall that is Station Square 
toward The Funny Bone and its conjoined bar and 
grill, The Green Room. While “withdrawing funds” 
from an ATM in the small shopping mall across the 
street from Funny Bone, I was reminded of a contin­
uing trend in Pittsburgh’s nightlife. While leaving 
the mall I passed The Crawford Grill On the .Square, 
a recent addition to the mall, and a mall-ized version 
of the original Crawford Grill in the Hill District.
For those not aware, which is a regrettably large 
number, The Crawford Grill has been hosting jazz 
acts six or seven nights a week for over 70 years. 
Having brought in every important black artist in 
jazz from the heyday of bop to the emergence of 
fusion, it continues to showcase local acts while serv­
ing soul food and strong drinks.
Although I’m sure the owners of The Crawford Grill 
are profiting from its new satellite campus, as well 
they should be, its situation is typical of the condi­
tions that make Station Square a successful entity, 
and of the struggle between “Old Neighborhood 
Pittsburgh” and “New Midwestern Development 
Pittsburgh.”
In “Neighborhood Pittsburgh,” where our (or at least 
my) parents grew up, on a Friday night one goes out 
to dinner at a neighborhood restaurant like Ritter’s 
Diner, Gullifty’s, or Lombardozzi’s. Afterwards one 
hits a local bar like Murphy’s, Chiodo’s, or The Elbow 
Room for a few cocktails or an Iron City.
In “Development Pittsburgh,” where our generation 
is growing up, the urge for many is to drive out of 
their neighborhoods into a space that could be in any 
mid-size mid-western city. Once in that space, one 
has dinner at a chain restaurant like Hooters or an 
antiseptic megaplex of a place like Philthy 
McNast/s, before hitting the bar either in that same 
restaurant, or down the block at Bar Louie. There 
one can feel free to suck down Coors Light while lis­
tening to a hack with an acoustic guitar offer up Billy 
Joel tunes and other sing-along faves like the arti­
facts of a culture that exists only in the minds of local 
franchise owners.
I’m not debating the cultural relevance of the area, 
because it’s perfectly legit for people to like different 
things. I’m only suggesting that the next time you 
question why your or your mother’s or grandmoth­
er’s area of Bloomfield/Point Breeze/South Side is 
going to pot, or why Pittsburgh is becoming a less 
culturally vibrant city as a whole, consider the eco­
nomic effects of spending your money in a three- 
block cultural strip mall on the other side of town.
But enough about what’s wrong with Station Square 
and on to what’s right about Funny Bone. Upon 
being seated in the Showroom area, a large cool 
room furnished mostly with molded plastic patio fur­
niture — it may not be a smoky hole-in-the-wall 
club, but I’m sure it’s convenient to be able to hose 
everything down — you find that this place actually 
has character.
Spread out on both sides of the corner stage (which 
has a painted 2-D cutout of Ed Sullivan clapping on 
one side) are huge reproductions of famous paint­
ings. Among these are a version of Michaelangelo’s 
Sistine Chapel fresco of God giving Adam life, in 
which Adam Sandler’s face has been interposed on 
the other Adam’s body. On the other side of the 
stage is an interpretation of da Vinci’s “Last Supper,” 
with Lenny Bruce as Jesus, which may be incorrect, 
if only because when it comes to comedy, Lenny is 
God, not His son.
A closer look at The Green Room (named for the 
waiting room in many clubs and TV studios) 
revealed a rather average bar, with surprising black 
and white photos. The frank nudes and street scenes 
brought the room back from the brink of blandness. 
As the lights dimmed in the showroom, Joe Eberle, a 
local comic for whom hosting weekends at Funny 
Bone is a regular gig, took the stage to warm up the 
crowd.
Having failed to crank up the crowd of a dozen cou­
ples and a bachelor party beyond a couple of solid 
laughs at wedding jokes (“All that matters is the 
open bar.”), he thanked them for their “thunderous 
round of indifference” and introduced the next 
comic.
Bill Scott, also a local act and a Funny Bone regular, 
came on stage to applause, and after threatening to 
brain me if I didn’t stop scribbling, slid into 20 min­
utes worth of sardonic digs at the docile bachelor 
party in the front row. He went from there into a 
slew of tried-and-true, but funny, masturbation, 
relationship, and comedy-as-a-career-choice jokes. 
Overall, he didn’t break any particularly stunning
new ground or provide any shocking insights into 
the human condition, but it was a solid performance. 
Which is more than I can say for Jeff Shaw, a nation­
al act and the main attraction. A pudgy guy with 
lank blond hair and almost absurdly high voice, he 
took the mic and introduced himself.
“Hi, I’m Jeff Shaw and I’m straight. I hope a few of 
you fuckers lost money on that.”
He started well, with a few decent jokes about the 
state of Pittsburgh’s roads and finances, but lost all 
momentum with a run of bad NASCAR jokes that are 
probably more successful with Southern audiences. 
He continued to flounder, doing stale-feeling bits 
about growing up sounding like a girl, and joining 
the Army reserves to become more manly, before 
resorting to surfing the opinions of the crowd, doing 
Bush jokes, “Arab” jokes, and vague ethnic jokes in 
between berating the crowd for being unenthusias- 
tic. He ended on one of his only high notes, the 
applause at the end of a long, and mostly forgettable, 
bit about how, according to women, when a man 
cheats on a woman it’s because he’s an asshole, while 
when a woman cheats on a man, it’s because he’s an 
asshole.
Walking back to my car through a block-long section 
of neon and blinking lights that made the Strip 
District look classy, it occurred to me that in a way, if 
perhaps a convoluted way, the reason Bill Scott got 
the laughs and Jeff Shaw did not, is the light at the 
end of the tunnel for neighborhood restaurants and 
bars.
Pittsburgh comics from Pittsburgh neighborhoods 
know what makes Pittsburghers laugh, while nation­
al comics with streamlined jokes for a non-regional 
audience flounder on NASCAR bits.
Do I feel that the acts I saw were worth the $13 
weekend-night admission plus two-drink minimum? 
(By the way, since drinks are priced about the same 
as a relatively upscale bar, you can’t really escape 
without paying a little over $20 per person.) Yes. 
Would I feel that way if your school-funded newspa­
per weren’t covering my tab? Maybe not.
Would I have rather seen this show in Oakland or in 
the South Side proper? Yes. Could I have? Probably 
not. Am I glad to have experienced threats of physi­
cal violence in the name of bringing you a mediocre 
“review” of a slightly better than mediocre experi­
ence at a reasonably interesting venue? No.
Were they funny threats? Absolutely.

Zen Garden
Upscale dining for the carnivorously challenged
Zen Garden seems innocent enough —just another upscale Chinese restau­
rant — but when they say homemade fish, they mean it. It is the type of restau­
rant where you make a dinner date but fudge the menu description to your com­
panions. I probably would not have been able to schedule an interview and a 
restaurant review at this place simultaneously if my company had known that 
meat was not even allowed on the premises. Our vegetarian waiter clarified that 
the restaurant could not monitor meat intake off its premises.
Whether my slight deception mattered or not I will never know, but you must 
have some company to experience Chinese eats properly, and to get a good sam­
pling of this Garden’s meatless offerings on which to pass judgment.
The restaurant had brisk business, luring a wide demographic of Squirrel 
Hill residents even at 6:30 on a Thursday night — not the deadest time for a 
restaurant, of course, but Zen Garden is certainly par for the course if not better. 
Our threesome — a politician, a food-lover, and myself the lone vegetarian — sat 
somewhat comfortably amidst the old ladies, young hipsters, and yuppies. The 
ambient noise left our conversation intact, but the politician noted that his knees 
had hit the low bottoms of these same tables when the space’s previous Italian 
food inhabitants rented the front. I’d never sat at these tables before, but my legs 
also had to be folded properly to avoid discomfort. Nonetheless, my tongue gave 
me pause even as we began to munch on the sweet marinated vegetables that 
commence a meal at Zen Garden; nothing fancy, but a good whetstone for the 
appetite.
We started off with Crispy Wontons and a Dim-Sum sample platter of deli­
cious dumplings. The Crispy Wontons seemed less appealing to me once I found 
them to be stuffed with cream cheese, but I nibbled one to reaffirm my distaste 
for the stuff. Nonetheless, the appetizer disappeared the way an excellent appe­
tizer does, short one eater; nine wontons gone (even my half-eaten contribu­
tion), and one hastily eaten up as the waiter came to promptly collect our dirty 
dishes. We all got off on the eight dumplings arranged on romaine in the wood­
en basket, and they got even better once we remembered to use the various 
sauces of vinegar and soy and a subtle sweet and sour sauce. The steamed array 
included a few dumplings of spinach and what was probably a wheat gluten 
meat imitation, as well as a dumpling that came very close to a normal pork 
dumpling, with perhaps an improvement in healthfulness and taste. The Thai- 
influenced crystal dumplings with translucent bean curd noodles, though, left us 
all wishing for more than just two total.
With the food-lover in tow, I expected little criticism, as I have no doubt that 
she would be hard to disappoint, but she was right about the dishes. Small plates 
to place your dumplings on, tiny, elegant dishes for the sauces, and lacquered 
chopsticks only began what could have been a lot of clutter, but our waiter kept 
our table cleared of unnecessary debris so that we could experience the meal to 
full effect. Once I had placed my tea bag in the golfball-sized dish that was placed 
before me, it was whisked away by the efficient waitstaff.
Not that we needed the tea bag incident for the waitstaff s speed to be appar­
ent; our entrees arrived just on the heels of our ample hors d’oeuvres, set steam­
ing on a tray-jack and placed before us as we marveled at their sumptuous col­
ors.
The politician’s Sesame Sensation (“beef’) beckoned me many times across 
the table, and the wonder of family-style dining got me past my comment that I 
would only want a bite of everyone else’s food, just to sample for my review. The 
waiter told us the big spoons and the extra plates were so that we could share, 
and I gladly obliged. Luck being upon me, I was also able to secure the leftover 
“beef’ for pre-review enjoyment. It tasted just as succulent and sweet and chewy 
after 4 hours in my car as it had tasted at the restaurant.
The food-lover’s Taro BOwl A-La-King did little for me, though she enjoyed 
the novelty of what was certainly the most unique thing on our table. It tasted to 
me like Vegetable Upma, an Indian dish that sort of resembles mashed potatoes 
but without the mouth-melting characteristics that make Grandma’s mashed 
reds great. She attacked the dish with relish, though, demolishing the potato 
mound with the crispy outside, and I contented myself by sniping the vegeta­
bles, cashews, and fake meat products that were piled on the dish to create a daz­
zling array of color and taste.
My own dish, Sweet and Sour Veggie Shrimp, was ordered to put the restau­
rant to the test. Surely you cannot extract soy protein or wheat glutens to make 
a shrimp, a true delicacy in the meat eater’s world. These are the little beasts you 
pile on top of veal, because they are the treasures (I learned that working at an 
Italian restaurant this summer). The veggie-shrimp confirmed my suspicions but 
allayed my fears. They tasted like the processed crabmeat made of whitefish you 
find so often in futomaki and nigiri sushi, and they came well-battered and with 
a light sauce most unlike the red slop in which they drench cheap sweet and sour 
foods in the bad Chinese delivery business. In my meat-eating days, I’d leave the 
canned pineapple chunks and cherries and vegetables to swim in the sauce until 
they later found the garbage can, but these were a treat.
In the end, our large and small appetizer, three entrees, hot and iced teas, 
and fresh-squeezed carrot juice came to 70 bucks after a generous tip (the wait­
er deserved it), and we walked away pleasantly stuffed with leftovers. It’s a bit 
on the expensive side, but if you aren’t trying to be exotic, you could certainly eat 
alone and have a good meal for about twelve dollars. It’s not just the rice, either; 
they don’t try and make up for losses elsewhere with a pile of the stuff—brown 
and white both, the rice is well prepared. If that is still outside your budget, you 
can have lunch and just have water for about seven dollars. Day or night, meat or 
meat-free, the restaurant is sure to please the open-minded and set straight those 
who are properly tricked into coming.

Android 6
Funk-rock takes on The Underground
Android 6 drew quite a crowd last Tuesday as 
eager first-year students crammed into the 
Underground to get their first taste of college. Eyes 
were pointed toward the stage and heads bobbed to 
the band’s set of upbeat music. Fantastic guitar and 
bass work kept students in their seats and listening 
until the very last song of the set. The band’s per­
formance was even more impressive considering 
their history.
“We’ve been playing music for five days,” said 
bassist Adam Reese.
While Android 6’s current incarnation is young,
the various members have been playing music 
together off and on since high school. Even though 
college separated Reese, Fritz Meyers (vocals, gui­
tar), Ryan Williams (guitar), and Nate Bogos 
(drums), they still managed to make music occasion­
ally.
“During breaks from school the four often got 
together and did free-form improvisational avant 
garde noise-funk-rock,” reveals their website. It was 
during these sessions that the members were able to 
pull their various styles together into a cohesive 
sound, and that practice was evident on Tuesday 
evening.
The band played mostly cover songs, though they 
did include two originals in their set. They ended 
with one of these songs, and it stood out above many 
of their covers. For a five-day-old band, the four can 
rock.
The performance was not flawless, however. The 
drums dominated the sound in the small venue, at 
times overpowering the other elements of the music. 
The vocals were usually the first casualty, sometimes 
getting lost under the power of the instrumental
music. Fritz Meyers’s vocals were the least-impres­
sive aspect of the sound, overshadowed by the string 
work and lost in the beat of the drums.
The band also had a lot of dead time in between 
songs that they would use to promote their demo 
CDs, which were being sold at the event. While the 
music was playing, Android 6 commanded the stage, 
but once the song ended, their stage presence fal­
tered. The set would have benefited from smoother 
transitions from song to song.
Android 6’s first gig was a definite success, and 
they have big plans for the future. The band’s web­
site notes that future gigs are planned for Ithaca, 
New York, and that they are “looking at a place 
called Fuel and Fuddle.” The band is off to a strong 
start, and with the various members having musical 
experience going back to their early teens it would 
not be surprising to see this group move up to more 
impressive venues in the future.
More information and samples of Android 6’s 
music can be found at their website,

Big Al’s Metal Shop:
Anthrax destroys Pittsburgh ... news at 11
Two decades ago, the leading lights of the Thrash 
movement were the four horsemen of metal: 
Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax. All four 
enjoyed major label success, all four had (and still 
maintain) rabid fan bases, and all four broke new 
ground for the New Wave of American Heavy Metal 
that we are witnessing now. And all, except 
Megadeth, are in existence today. However, while 
Metallica and Slayer have enjoyed a stable career arc 
on their respective labels this last decade, Anthrax 
has had to contend with a merry-go-round of labels. 
After 1994’s seminal (and certified gold) Sound of 
White Noise, which sold over 500,000 copies, 
Anthrax released the aptly-titled Stomp 442 and 
Volume 8 — The Threat Is Real! Both of these albums 
had stellar production and were chock-full of Scott 
Ian’s trademark guitar work. Yet it seemed at times 
that their record company’s reluctance to push 442, 
or in the case of Volume 8, the label going under, that 
Anthrax would be doomed to producing progressive- 
thrash albums that nobody would ever hear. 
Thankfully, Anthrax has found label Sanctuary, figu­
ratively and literally. With We’ve Come For You All, 
the artists known for the first rap-metal collabora­
tion (“Bring the Noise” with Public Enemy) have 
stepped up to the plate and smashed one over the 
fences.
The album starts out with “What Doesn’t Die,” 
which leads the band out like a hungry boxer to the 
ring. With a one-two punch of “Superhero” and 
“Refuse To Be Denied,” Anthrax goes in for the K.O. 
that is “Safe Home.” Probably their best radio-friend­
ly single since “Bring the Noise,” “Safe Home” is the
band at its finest: experimental. Molding melody 
with sing-along hooks, “Safe Home” is one of my 
favorite songs this year (and it plays amazingly live; 
more on that later). “Black Dahlia” is ferocious, as is 
“Taking the Music Back” which features the trade­
mark scream of Roger Daltrey (of The Who, if you 
must ask). And of course, this would not be a mod­
ern-day Anthrax album without the now-obligatory 
Dimebag Darrell (Pantera) guest solo on “Cadillac 
Rock Box.” So, to complete their return to throne, 
Anthrax have taken killer new bands like Lacuna 
Coil, E-Town Concrete, and Lamb of God on the road 
with them. These groups are the future of metal, and 
Can send any mosh pit into a frenzy. But last Friday 
night, Anthrax returned to Pittsburgh after a five- 
year hiatus and showed all how it is done live. As the 
lights dimmed, game show music segued into “What 
Doesn’t Die.” There was not a single hand in the 
crowd not in the air. Every period in their history was 
covered — from “Metal Thrashing Mad” and 
“Antisocial” to stuff off of Stomp 442 and Volume 8. 
For all of us Maiden-ites in the crowd, a highlight 
came at the end when the band engaged us with a 
crushing cover of “Number of the Beast.” Everyone 
sang along, stomped their feet, and knew every word 
to “Safe Home;” honestly, if this song does not rei 
troduce the band to a new generation of kids, it will 
be a shame. The set ended, of course, with “Bring the 
Noise.” As the crowd stumbled out, sweaty and satis­
fied, you couldn't help but feel like it was 1984 all 
over again....

The Bride of Dracula
Courtest of Edgar Allan Poe Theatre
Elizabeth Haag, Gabriel Angelo Bruni, April Lynne Radzanowski, and Jessica Kennedy (l-r), sharing a snack.
The Dos and Don’ts of onstage suckage
Some people suck their paper cuts with a little too 
much alacrity, savoring the tiny taste of their own 
blood. Some people like their steaks rare. Then 
there’s Dracula, freshly revived by the Edgar Allen 
Poe Theatre (EAPT) in Michael McGovern’s The 
Bride of Dracula, an adaptation that focuses on the 
cruel, cannibalistic nature of the classic man-woman 
relationship.
His three brides are fascinating, if a little oversexed. 
Austere and pale, blonde demagogue Clarimonde 
(young community theater veteran Elizabeth Haag) 
was the first, and Haag makes it clear who’s in 
charge. Dark, doe-eyed Genevieve (April Lynne 
Radzanowski, also the costume designer) was 
plucked from the window of a convent, and willing­
ly stripped of her habit to dance naked with her 
newer, more rapacious master. Glamorous, lusty 
Kashi (recent IUP graduate Jessica Kennedy), eyes 
rimmed with kohl, was swept off an auction block in 
Istanbul and tortured for a thousand nights with 
pleasures only the undead can describe before 
Dracula finally gave her his blood to drink.
But even these three succulent specimens cannot 
seem to slake the Count’s thirst for long. As the 
familiar story progresses, his relationship with his 
brides sours, and Dracula taps into the new blood of 
visiting real estate agent Jonathan Harker (Angelo 
Gabriel Bruni) and makes plans to vacate his castle 
for the English moors when he hears about Harker’s 
pure and dainty fiancee, Mina (Michelle L. LeWay). 
The Brides are never far behind, and, in their new 
state of independence, are free to explore both feed­
ing and magic with a growing power and enthusi­
asm.
EAPT Artistic Director Michael McGovern’s treat­
ment of the classic spook tale sometimes successful­
ly imitates fellow Dracula playwright Steven Dietz, 
whose famous take on the story relies on luscious 
imagery with rhythm as strong as a throbbing pulse. 
But trying too hard sometimes poisons McGovern’s 
ingenious efforts, as do sharp chips of bony, brazen 
theatricality that stick in the craw and make one 
turn away.
The actors’ efforts, too, are a charming combination 
of plucky amateur zeal, technique passed on byword 
of mouth, and polished work. James Michael 
Shoberg, playing Dracula, is as at home on the stage 
as only a lifelong theatre-dweller can be. His 
Transylvanian accent passes muster, and his acting 
efforts are respectable, but the true substance of this 
role is the combination of lordly ego and voracious 
hunger for attention that veteran actors understand 
all too well. No player in this piece lags far behind
Shoberg in flair, either. Carrie L. Shoberg’s pious 
Lucy, Mina’s convent-bound cousin, turns into a flir­
ty child-seducer with delicately withered fingertips 
and big, hungry eyes that become truly creepy as the 
play goes on. April Lynne Radzanowski’s dialect 
work is a bit unschooled, but her gentleness makes it 
seem like she could really have been snatched from 
a nunnery. Jessica Kennedy’s Kashi, surely the Bride 
with the hottest blood, prowls the stage like a 
lioness, and speaks with a trained, crisp dialect that 
could only be the product of a decent theater school.
Visually, the play uses to good advantage the natu­
rally dank conditions of the theater; stage space is 
carved out of the blackness by the sallow fangs of a 
few can lights strung on the empty-looking grid and 
strange green dragons by scenic artist Forest 
Gardner coil themselves around painted pillars on 
the flat back wall. Some elegant chairs float in and 
out, and a red bed hovers in the upstage corners, but 
it is not what we see in the space that makes us 
believe, it is what we do not see.
Costumes are a different story. The fruits of April 
Lynne Radzanowski’s double duty as costumer are 
sparkling — partly because she really likes glitter. 
(This may be an unfair accusation, because, often as 
not, when a production is as moribund as this one, 
the hierarchy of authority can become a little shaky. 
When this happens, costumed teenage urchins and 
acolytes tend to bring their own glitter, and will 
sometimes splash it on when no one else is looking.)
Sparkles and the occasional anachronism notwith­
standing, Radzanowski does a fair job of competing 
with big-budget theatres, both with skill and pure 
imagination. The tiny, bloody handprints that smear 
the bottom of Lucy’s skirt create a moment of pure 
horror — and admiration for the costume designer
— when we learn from her dialogue that she has 
been eating children. The count’s all-black ensemble 
of ruffles, top hat, and cane create an impeccably 
tailored gentlemanly quality a lousy seamstress 
couldn’t imitate. But there were exceptions: if Mina’s 
blue, Dolly Madison-ish two-piece dress makes her 
look like an NFL lineman, that can hardly be blamed 
on Mina.
This is the kind of local production that redefines the 
“community” in community theater. Sophisticated 
touches and well-wrought collaboration coexist with 
amateurish lapses in vision; cello arrangements by 
noted musical maestro Scott Otto are mixed right in 
with the script’s single, ill-conceived allusion to 
menstrual blood and the overdone Dracula swoosh 
that seems to get a little sillier with each exit. And a 
few moments find themselves drinking to the last 
dregs of dubious taste, like the Brides’ french-kissing 
ritual and strobe-lit, WWF-style brawl near the end. 
But for sheer, lyrical, ridiculous entertainment 
value, Brides is unbeatable, and Pittsburgh needs 
another boring theater company like it needs a hole 
in the jugular.

Pittsburgh Does the Two-Step
A look at salsa, swing, and belly dancing in the 'Burgh
A woman takes a step to the side as she simultaneously pushes her right hip out 
and gazes into her partner’s eyes. As Son by Four’s salsa remix of “A Puro Dolor” 
plays, her partner’s hand presses into the center of her back, guiding her into a 
cross-body lead. She takes a spin and is now on her own. Her arms are out to her 
sides, wrists slightly flexed as her middle finger guides the flow of energy through 
her body; her left hip thrusts forward, and then her right hip, as she does a shoul­
der shimmy. She smiles as her eyes scan the room seductively, looking for an 
admirer. Next, her partner is back, but with a renewed energy that enables him to 
pick the woman up over his head and send her flying through the air, her skirt 
whirling around her hips. She lands on the ground with perfect timing as her part­
ner does a fast two-step towards her, taking her hand as they kick-ball-change in 
time to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy’s “You and Me and a Bottle Makes Three Tonight.”
Now, all these moves would never be put together in one dance combo; howev­
er, there is a little bit of style in the dances mentioned above. Fast turns and ener­
gy are needed for both Latin and swing dances, while slow and sensual undula­
tion, arm movements, and hip lifts are used in belly dancing. Though most of the 
clubs on the streets of downtown Pittsburgh, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill require 
their clientele to be 21 and over, there are some places that cater to people all ages 
in the Pittsburgh community in the areas of Latin, swing, and belly dancing. A man 
who can dance salsa well can turn a woman’s head. A couple who can dance salsa 
well will make a whole dance floor stop to admire them. The flashy outfit of the 
woman and the suave sexuality of the man can truly capture an audience in the 
area of Latin dancing, where timing and energy is the key to leaving an impression 
on the dance floor. At CMU, learning how to dance salsa and merengue (two of the 
most popular styles of Latin dancing) has become popular and is in demand every 
semester that it is offered. The Spanish-American and Latin Student Association 
(SALSA) has offered students and faculty many opportunities to learn the basics 
of salsa dancing, getting some of the best instructors in Pittsburgh to teach. The 
class sizes are usually limited to about 25 people because space is limited (classes 
are run out of the Activities Room in the University Center). Each class lasts four
to six weeks, once a week for an hour, and costs $20 or $25. Last year, the 
Graduate School of Industrial Administration sponsored salsa lessons, and those 
wanting to know how to use their feet for more than Dance Dance Revolution were 
champing at the bit to sign up. Unfortunately, the classes were filled almost as 
soon as the announcement was made.
For a more strict and disciplined approach to Latin dancing, the Ballroom Dance 
Club is available to those who want to master the art of salsa, merengue, cha-cha, 
samba, jive, foxtrot, swing, rhumba, paso, quickstep, tango, waltz, and Viennese 
waltz. Lessons are held every Wednesday at 7 pm in Rangos Ballroom (so you 
don’t have to worry about running out of room to dance) and the first lessons are 
free. Dues of $20 a semester are collected later. Ballroom dancing is very different 
from your average Salsa dancing because the steps are more intricate. Whereas in 
your average salsa spin for a woman, she would take her left foot, push off, pivot 
on her right, and come back to face her partner, a ballroom-style spin may require 
that woman to take her left foot, go down into a split, be pulled back up by her 
partner into a centralized triple spin, and face forward with just enough time to 
inhale before going into some fast footwork.
Many of the clubs in Pittsburgh have Latin nights, featuring live bands as well as 
DJs mixing their best Latin beats. Cozumel Restaurant, located at 5505 Walnut 
Street in Shadyside (above Victoria’s Secret), has DJs on Friday nights and live 
bands on Saturday nights. The cover charge ranges between $5 and $7, depending 
on which night you go. SALSA occasionally gathered at Cozumel after events they 
would hold on campus. The $5 cover charge on Fridays includes a free drink, and 
the dancing goes on from 10 pm to 2 am. Saturday night, the dancing starts at 
10:30 pm, and though no free drink is included with the cover charge, people still 
enjoyed spinning across the wood parquet floor.
Club Havana, located at 5574 Ellsworth Avenue, Shadyside, also offers Latin 
dancing throughout the week for Pittsburgh’s socialites. The upscale environment 
permits its inhabitants to gorge themselves on martinis until fully satiated and to 
smoke the finest cigars while partaking in dance workshops before the main set. 
Instructor Marlon Silva gives lessons on Wednesdays and Sundays, focusing on 
Latin line dancing on Wednesday from 8 to 9 pm and a variety of Latin dances 
(salsa, merengue, samba, and cha-cha) on Sundays for beginners (7 to 8 pm) and 
for intermediate and advanced dancers (8 to 10 pm). Fortunately for those who 
may be short on cash come Wednesdays, there is no cover charge, and a $5 cover 
on Sundays has one free drink included.
Even though one is guaranteed to have a good time at Pittsburgh’s salsa clubs, 
they aren’t exactly made for children of all ages. However, Colleen and Jeff Shirey 
have taken care of that problem by hosting social dances twice a month at the 
Bulgarian Macedonian Cultural Center (BMCC) located at 449 West 8th Avenue, 
West Homestead. The dancing is for people of all ages and requires a $5 cover 
charge. Like Club Havana and Cozumel, BMCC offers dance lessons before the 
main dance set for people of all skill levels: beginner at 8 pm and intermediate at 
8:30. Once the party gets going, everyone hits the dance floor to showcase what 
they have learned. However, the night is not complete without the Shireys’ going 
out on the dance floor and putting on a show for their patrons. The Edgewood 
Club is another alternative to the club scene for those who still want to boogie to 
the sultry sounds of salsa. On the first and third Sundays of every month, the 
Edgewood club holds lessons at 7 pm and begins the social dance at 8 pm, which 
goes on until 10:30 pm.
Swing dancing, like salsa, has grown in popularity over the years; people not 
only see it as something fun to do on the weekends, but also as a way of keeping 
in shape and keeping the spirit young. The Wightman School, 5604 Solway Street, 
holds swing dance lessons every Saturday and welcomes dancers of all ages. For 
dues of $20 a semester, swing lessons were once held in the activities room of the 
University Center on Tuesdays. However, the swing kids moved lessons to the 
University of Pittsburgh. A typical social dance party would start with an instruc­
tional set at around 8 pm, during which those who wanted to learn the basic 
moves of swing would be able to learn them before everyone jumped onto the 
floor to strut their best stuff in their best dance shoes with their best guy or girl 
from 9 pm until midnight.

One of the newest trends catching people’s eyes is the art of belly dancing. In 
Pittsburgh, the styles that are in high demand are Cabaret and Tribal. The Cabaret 
style allows the glitz and glamour of night club dancing to shine through with full 
force, while the Tribal style offers a more folkloric ambience to its audience with 
circle skirts or pantaloons made out of heavy material and coins or tassels strung 
around their hips. Debbie Antantis, most commonly known as Raihana to her stu­
dents, has been studying the art of Cabaret-style belly dancing since she was 19 
years old.
“I’m 40 years old now,” says Raihana, “but [belly dancing] is such a beautiful art 
form that you just don’t want to quit once you start.”
The key to learning how to belly dance well is in learning how to control your 
body yet still make the movements themselves seem effortless. You may think to 
yourself, “Well, isn’t that the purpose to all dances? To make it seem effortless?” 
This is very true, but how often will you see a belly roll, body undulation, and 
chest drop combo in swing dancing? The key elements of belly dancing are con­
centrated in hip movements, undulations, and smooth arm movements in a snake­
like motion. The type of music that is playing is depicted in the way the belly 
dancer moves across the floor, and depending on the style she is portraying, the 
dancer may use props such as swords, veils, or finger cymbals.
The attire for belly dancing depends greatly on the woman and the impression 
she would like to give to her audience. The modest woman would be more inclined 
to wear an outfit that covers her entire body, layering material on top of material 
with a veil or scarf wrapped about her head. However, a more contemporary 
dancer may wear an outfit that bares her midriff, arms, and thighs through a 
provocative slit in a skirt studded with sparkly beads and sequins.
“That’s the beauty of [belly dancing],” said Raihana. “I mean, where else will 
you be able to wear too much eye makeup and sequins and make up your own 
name?”
“I’ve been dancing about a year now and just love it,” said Kelley Hartsell, a fre­
quent dancer at the Wightman School, which she also said is her favorite place to 
dance.
The attire for swing dancing is simple: anything that you can groove in. You can 
usually see women in loose skirts or dresses with a pair of shorts underneath for 
minimum exposure during flips and fast spins. Saddle or soft shoes with soft 
smooth bottoms are usually worn to allow maximum spinning and sliding across 
the dance floor, though some women wear shoes with a slight heel. Men’s shoes 
are also soft and usually saddle in style. During a regular dance lesson, men will 
usually wear loose pants and shirt. However, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a guy 
in a full zoot suit (firing arm not included).
The main clubbing spot for the swinging crowd is the Edgewood Club at 1 
Pennwood Avenue, Edgewood on Sundays, where one can hear live swing bands 
like Dr. Zoot and His Suits, Benny Benack Jr. Combo, and 5 Guys Named Moe, as 
well as DJed music from swing kings such as the Cherry Poppin’ Daddies, Big Bad 
Voodoo Daddy, and Louis Jordan. Dancers can start jumping and jiving on the 
floor at 8 pm, and, like the Wightman School, there is a workshop at 7 for new 
dancers prior to the main festivities. Cozumel also offers swing on Friday nights 
from 11 pm to 1:30 am with an instructional set at 10:30 pm.
On October 5 and 6, the Visionary Belly Dancing Caravan Tour, 
featuring dancer Delilah and musician Sirocco, will come to 
Pittsburgh to hold workshops for all of those who want to 
learn the art of belly dancing. Raihana 
described Delilah’s dancing as being 
“purely visionary” because she does not 
focus on one specific style of danc­
ing, which is also a main character­
istic of Tribal belly dancing. The cost 
of the workshop on Sunday, October 
5, is $48 before September 22 and
Bum Lee/Art Editor
$55 afterward. It will last from 3 to 6 pm at the Yoga Sadhana (1113 E. Carson 
Street, South Side). Following the workshop, Delilah will perform from 7:30 to 9 
pm for $15. An extra workshop will also be held on Monday, October 6, for those 
interested in learning more hip and finger cymbal techniques from 1 to 3 pm; 
there is a $60 fee which includes a free CD of music by Sirocco for those who reg­
ister before September 22 and a $70 fee for those who register afterward.
Jeff Shirey once said in an interview with The Tartan that “dancing is our way of 
communicating with each other.” Though he was referring to the chemistry 
between himself and his wife Colleen, his statement goes a long way. During danc­
ing, it is important to look at who you are dancing with, or even who you are danc­
ing for. With swing dancing, precision and trust is a must with the lifts, spins, dips, 
and dives that the dancers put themselves and their partners through to keep 
those who watch enthralled with the show. The new wave of belly dancers are 
bringing their own visions into the once-traditional art and creating something 
that has quickly become a rage. Friedrich Nietzsche said, “We should consider 
every day lost in which we do not dance at least once.” The Pittsburgh communi­
ty has provided us with such means that we may not lose a single day.

Hill District Hero
Tennie Harris receives credit long overdue
Photo Courtesy of cmoa.org.
A tired waitress leans on the countertop of the 
Crawford Grill, her dimpled elbow pressing with the 
full weight of a long shift. Her shining cheeks, also 
dimpled, are set in the grin of relief, her eyebrows 
loosened in a sigh. Her break is almost over — in a 
second or two, she will have to pick up her tray and 
bustle away. But now, right now, she is smiling at 
Teenie Harris.
The Carnegie Museum of Art in Oakland is cur­
rently exhibiting 300 of Charles ‘Teenie’ Harris’s
80,000 photographs, documenting Pittsburgh’s most 
historic urban neighborhood, the Hill District, from 
the 1930s to the 1960s. Harris spent 40 years as a 
photographer for the Pittsburgh Courier, which was 
based in Pittsburgh, but nationally acknowledged as 
the most prevalent black newspaper. He is said to 
have created the greatest mass of photographs of any 
African-American society in the world, far exceeding 
the portfolio of James VanDerZee, one of Harris’ 
contemporaries who is famous for his documenta­
tion of Harlem.
Walking into the Forum Gallery at the museum, 
visitors may need to use one of the museum’s magni­
fying glasses to view any of the 300 4 by 5" contact 
prints of Harris’ exhibited work. One photo, 'Four 
Women on a Porch Swing at the Lemington Home' 
(1945), invites scrutiny. Unlike any of the other 
images, this 4 by 5" contact print is displayed with a 
range of 8 by 10" enlargement prints of the same
image, individually mounted and framed within a 
large white border. This photograph was printed by 
archivist Gus Kayafas to demonstrate darkroom and 
development techniques like cropping, exposure, 
and contrasting. These prints also provide a preview 
of the care in preparation and display the museum 
intends to implement for their even grander exhibit 
of Harris' work in 2008.
Because of the sheer number of small images and 
the amount of information hiding in each one, the 
journey from one end of the exhibit to the other can 
be a long one. And the details cry out for attention. 
Harris saw a cleaner world; the photographs often 
contain a variety of store signs and other advertise­
ments visible, but they do not seem glandular. It is 
apparent from his images, however, that advertising 
and business ethics have always pushed the ethical 
envelope, and that African-American neighborhoods 
were never spared a moment of this ‘progress.’ His 
photographs progress from tranquil city scenes to 
streets crowed with livid, disenchanted workers, mil­
itary personnel, students, and teachers carrying 
signs that read, “Housing Authority, you must be fair 
to our Community,” “Hill District Shacks Must Go,” 
“From G.I. fox holes to Hill District rat holes,” “Open 
the Schools,” and “Segregation Never.”
For Harris, integration was a state of mind. His 
photographs reveal a sense of tolerance, and even 
fascination, with the Hill District's many minority 
cultures. But big band musicians, athletes, and cus­
tomers of the local pharmacy were just plain human, 
and intentionally so, as part of Harris's mission to 
imprint the national mind’s eye with diversity. Still, 
he reserved a special affection for his own. From an 
image of jazz star Billy Eckstines on WCAE 1250 AM 
radio to a university classroom of black women 
glowing with smiles, it's apparent that Harris loved 
to chronicle the socioeconomic progress of his peo­
ple and the joy they took in their development in a 
white-centric society.
To this day, both his work and its subjects, the 
denizens of the Hill District, receive little of the 
attention they deserve from the rest of the city. One 
of the exhibit placards reads, “The Carnegie 
Museum of Art seeks community assistance identify­
ing Harris’ subjects.” This is a pre-exhibit, intended 
to pave the way to a “major exhibition and publica­
tion, followed by a national tour” in the projected 
year of 2008.
“The Pittsburgh Courier didn’t properly archive his 
notes,” said Jeff Swensen, a world-renowned profes­
sional photographer and photojournalist. “Harris 
must have known and/or documented the names of
a great number of the people in his photographs, 
because as a member of the [Hill District] communi­
ty and a photojournalist, it was his job.”
According to Swensen, Harris often chose to take 
each shot only once. He liked to “edit in his mind,” 
said Swensen, and would spend a great deal of time 
in a situation, watching and waiting for the right 
moment to expose one of the few sheets of 4/5” 
B&W film with his handheld, single-use-flashbulb 
mounted SpeedGraphic view camera.
His minimal use of equipment and supplies makes 
the number of photographs he took impressive, but 
more astonishing is the quality of each and every 
one. A great deal of the museum’s time and money 
will be devoted to storing, posting, or printing these 
images. The museum promises to post 3,600 of them 
online at a rate of 100 per month, and hopes to have
55,000 images online by 2007.
Harris, in a single moment in time, was masterful 
at capturing the core of his subject’s experience. He 
truly “lives on through the photographs that he 
took,” said Swensen. The cultural, political, and spir­
itual depth of Harris’ work will inevitably bring 
Pittsburgh's Hill District into the spotlight Harlem 
has enjoyed for so long as the sole reference point for 
African-American city life from the Depression to 
Vietnam.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
A new fall. A new beginning. A time for new friends and new love. The ducks of Whites pond were all aflutter fwith excitement, flitting to and fro, for this was the first f ^ day of the new season, and they were all overjoyed to Jfinally get to meet the new ducks. They flitted about and flirted with each other, and ruffed their feathers at those who flitted or flirted too close to the object of their flirtatious flits. Yes, every year around this time, White’s pond is awash with excitement. But this year was different, for all eyes were on the most beautiful duck of all. Amy.

Comickaze:
Nick reviews the new Spectacular Spider-man series
Sober up and get ready for another 
year of comic book reviews and news. 
So take off that double-barrel beer hat 
and get ready for the semester. Hey, I 
said take the hat off.
Initially, I had intended to recap the 
comic book-based films of 2003 to kick 
off the new semester.
The train ride from Philadelphia to 
Pittsburgh provided me a lot of time to 
scratch out a few short reviews of 
Daredevil, Hulk, The League of 
Extraordinary Gentlemen, and X2: X- 
Men United.
Instead, I decided to catch up on some 
reading: The Dark Knight Returns, a 
definitive Batman tale by Frank Miller 
with Klaus Janson and Lynn Varley.
This graphic novel is considered 
among the greatest comic artworks of 
all time.
Upon completing the 199-page epic, I 
asked myself, “How do I follow that 
up?” I groaned at the notion of crack­
ing into August’s new comics. Eyeing 
the cover to Spectacular Spider-Man, I 
imagined the content would pale in 
comparison.
I was hesitant before flipping the cover 
because I was familiar with the previ­
ous collaboration between writer Paul 
Jenkins and penciler Humberto 
Ramos. Their short run in the now 
defunct Peter Parker: Spider-Man title 
left much to be desired.
Even an uncanny spider sense could 
not have prepared me for the new 
Spectacular Spider-Man monthly series 
from Marvel Comics.
Solid storytelling by Paul Jenkins and 
Humberto Ramos makes the title a 
modern superhero must-read.
In no time, I was lost in the pages of 
the story arc entitled “The Hunger.” 
This time around, Jenkins and Ramos 
produce an expertly-paced tale featur­
ing the villainous Venom. Spidey’s
black-and-white doppelganger is back, 
with deadly results.
The big difference is in the storytelling. 
Before, the work of Jenkins and Ramos 
was more of a grind than a pleasure to 
read. Fast-forward to 2003, and the 
creators are making up for any lost 
time with ferocious fights and heartfelt 
drama.
Jenkins expertly mixes brick-breaking 
action with tear-jerking moments. Toss 
in the graffiti-inspired illustrations of 
Humberto Ramos, top it off with 
dynamic inks by Wayne Faucher, add 
the icing that is colors by Studio F, and 
that’s one delicious read.
By day, Peter Parker is subjected to the 
emotional ups and downs of life. At 
night, Spider-Man emerges to tear up 
New York City’s criminal underworld. 
An invalid best friend and a tough 
police detective round out a solid sup­
porting cast.
The comic operates by switching 
between these two main plot threads 
every few pages. This creates a tight 
rhythm of cliffhangers and contempla­
tive pauses.
Right now the book is into its third 
issue, with the fourth arriving in mid- 
September.
Still, the new Spectacular Spider-Man 
series is not up to par with the classic 
The Dark Knight Returns, which 
Stephen King described as “possibly 
the finest piece of comic art ever to be 
published in popular edition.”
Spectacular Spider-Man is, however, a 
good read and well worth the $2.25 
cover price.
Swing by S. Craig Street’s Phantom of 
the Attic for issues old and new, or 
watch www.amazon.com for the col­
lected edition of “The Hunger,” coming 
in early 2004.

A Summer of Andy
From cartoons to kings, the Andy Warhol Museum is hopping
The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the most 
comprehensive single artist displays in the 
world, but the museum offers more than just 
Marilyn, apples, and Campbell’s soup. This 
summer marks “The Summer of Andy,” a sea- 
son-long posthumous celebration of his 75th 
birthday. Nestled in the North Side, The 
Warhol is an air-conditioned haven from the 
humid Pittsburgh streets for weary wanderers 
with the end-of-summer blues. One of its array 
of special exhibits and performances, “Too Hot 
to Handle: Creating Controversy Through 
Political Cartoons” (through August 31) has 
almost finished its run on the walls of The 
Warhol — and if you have not seen it yet, it is 
too bold to miss.
Like Andy himself, these cartoons just want­
ed to get a rise out of the public. Dealing with 
post-September 11 politics and issues, some 
strips are just controversial enough to have 
elicited angry letters from readers after they 
ran in print. Others are too hot and never made 
it past the editors. One artist, RJ Matson, knew 
his cartoon “President Gollum W. Bush” and its 
grotesque depiction of George W. Bush was 
over the top and was not surprised when it got 
rejected from the NY Observer, Roll Call, and 
The Nation.
“It was fun to draw,” was his defense when 
questioned by an editor about his cartoon's 
content. Another artist caused a bit more 
ruckus with his cartoon series “Boondocks.” 
Aaron McGruder ran two strips of “Boondocks” 
on October 4 and 19 of 2001. His cartoons were 
anti-nationalist and showed corruption in the 
American government. After an unbelievably 
high number of complaints to the publisher, 
"Boondocks" was pulled from newspapers 
including Newsday and The NY Daily News. 
McGruder responded by making more strips in 
the series.
One cartoon not only caused letters but phys­
ical protests and sit-ins by students on the cam­
pus of California-Berkley. Darrin Bell’s “9-11” 
ran on September 18 of 2001 in The Daily 
Californian, and showed Muslims in an intoler­
ant and uninformed way.
This year, Andy Singer’s 
“Terrorism/Militarism” was printed in inde­
pendent papers but denied by the St. Paul 
Pioneer Press. The catch here is that St. Paul’s 
Press often prints obscenities that allude to 
sodomy or child molestation, but they will not 
touch political cartoons — only in America.
Another worthwhile exhibit, just as bold for 
its intense exploration of human relationships, 
is “Keith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett 2000.” The 
artist and actress collaborated together to cre­
ate six statues that explored the balance 
between artist and model, fan and celebrity, 
desire and reality. Produced by the Art 
Production Fund, their collaboration was docu­
mented on a video that plays by the museum 
entrance. Andy Warhol, both fan and friend to 
Farrah Fawcett, has his own documentation of 
her. He snapped Polaroids of her, and wrote her
notes on linen napkins during their trip togeth­
er to Houston, Texas, in 1980. But the meat of 
the exhibit lies in the two, life-sized statues 
Edmier and Fawcett made of one another. 
Fawcett is immortalized in white marble, and 
Edmier in bronze. “I don’t think of it as me,” 
remarked Fawcett in the making-of documen­
tary screening nearby. The teamwork it took to 
make both statues, filmed and analyzed in the 
same documentary, was so intimate and 
intense that the statues don’t represent the 
people as much as the process. Sensual, fun, 
and flanked with orchids, their shared artistic 
vision is on the seventh floor until October 5.
Also up until October 5 is “The American 
Supermarket.” Warhol once said there was 
“nothing more American than a supermarket,” 
and that’s hard to argue with. With thousands 
of chain stores, every state across the country 
can eat its fill of all things bright, shiny, and 
pricey. This display is a recreation of the origi­
nal exhibit by Ben Brillo in 1964. The vision 
was to juxtapose overpriced plastic, chrome, 
wax, and metal ‘fake’ foods against under- 
priced paintings, prints, and other ‘real’ art. 
One of Warhol’s “Campbell’s Soup’s” debuted 
in the opening at the Bianchini Gallery in New 
York. This exhibit pushes the absurdity of 
American consumerism and is good for a laugh, 
though not good to attend on an empty stom­
ach.
The exhibit you might want to attend on an 
empty stomach is “Clown Paintings: From the 
Collection of Diane Keaton and Others.” 
Warhol was an avid collector. He liked to collect 
cookie jars (he had around 300), and liked the 
idea of many of one thing, which is evident 
from his screen-printing techniques. Similarly, 
Keaton was struck by an amateur clown pain­
ing one day at a flea market, and ever since has 
been traveling in search of more.
“In our media-dominated society where slick 
images glossed to perfection seduce us with 
superficial promises, at least the clown, fling­
ing himself outside the ordinary range of expe­
rience or explanation, without questioning the 
consequences, is unique,” she once said. 
Clowns show raw emotion, or rather, they can­
not hide their emotion. The fourth floor of the 
Warhol is littered with over 40 amateur clown 
paintings. Some are lighter in spirit than oth­
ers, but all share the drawn-on smile and the 
bright colors of childhood toys. This exhibit is 
not recommended for those squeamish around 
clowns; the intensity of some of the paintings 
provokes dueling positive and negative 
responses.
If you want to skip the clowns, make sure you 
visit the King; for right now The Warhol’s also 
got an exhibit dedicated to Elvis, an emotional 
rollercoaster from Warhol’s pop-art humor, and 
into his darker pop-reality, The Warhol’s got 
something for everyone. Students visit free of 
charge.
