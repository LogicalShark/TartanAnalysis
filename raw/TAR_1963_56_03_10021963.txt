Queen to Reign For Festival 
Frosh Girls Nominate Friday
A freshman woman reigns over Carnegie Tech only one 
weekend each year. Following a Tech tradition she and her 
two attendants will preside over the Fall Festival weekend 
festivities, October 25-26. The girls will be three of fifteen 
freshmen originally nominated for the position by other 
women in their class. They will be* 
the three receiving the largest
number of votes from the male 
student body of the campus.
Every freshman woman at Tech 
is eligible for the honor; but she 
must show her interest in the 
event by attending a meeting of 
all freshman women this Friday, 
Oct. 4, at 4:30 in the Wherrett 
Lounge* of Skibo.
Any freshman girl may nomi­
nate or be nominated, but she 
must be present at the assembly 
to give or accept a nomination. 
^ The class will nominate fifteen 
candidates, and the girls then pre­
sent at the assembly will vote to 
limit the number of nominess to 
seven. These seven will comprise 
the final group presented for the 
men’s ballot.
A round of dinners and activi­
ties is scheduled for these seven 
nominees. Men from the fraterni­
ties and dorms spend the two 
weeks before the final queen elec- 
C tion, meeting and talking with the 
candidates. In addition, the girls’ 
pictures will be posted several 
places around the campus.
Freshman women who would 
like further information before 
this Friday’s important assembly 
should contact Arlene Winner, 
Morewood Gardens 2C10, chair­
man of the Fall Festival queen 
committee.
CongressShows 
Ambitious 
Spark For ’63
The first meeting of Student 
Congress could be best represent­
ed by the agenda listed in neat 
order, for it was almost a model 
of an organized, ideal meeting. 
Passionless efficiency is the most 
expedient form of government, 
often embodied in dictatorships. 
But Tom Pyke is not a dictator. 
His welcome and three fold state­
ment of purpose could not have 
been more exemplary of what 
Adam Smith called “laissez-faire.” 
Congress as it exists at 4:30 on 
Wednesday afternoons, will act as 
a means of communication be­
tween committee heads, Executive 
Council and student body, and 
nothing more. And as a purpose, 
it seemed to demonstrate its suc­
cess immediately following, as 
each Committee Head reported. 
Fall Festival is leering at us from 
a month away, the Rules Commit­
tee is busy revising the brand-new 
handbook. Freshman Orientation

Pep Rally Draws Large 
Numbers of Spirited Students
Folk Singers Come For Festival; 
“Tech Time: 2000” is Theme
• ' —Photo by Jim Pawley
**WAIT A MINUTE girls, I dropped one of my contact lenses."
Last Friday night broke clear and cool, perfect pep rally 
weather. Over 400 spirited Tech students responded by parad­
ing to the Tech football stadium for the first pep rally of the 
season. The program included Tech songs by the band, the 
Pipers, and the familiar Tech cheers by the cheerleaders. But 
undoubtedly the high point of the* -----------——----------------------------:-----
$ evening was the introduction of 
our new football team by Coach 
Gasparella — the new team that 
scored as many points in their first 
game as the previous year’s team 
did all last season. After the team 
was introduced the crowd chose 
several of them to speak: Abels, 
Ferguson, Palmo, Mangarella, 
Mordecai, Heckler, and Gilcrest. 
These players explained the nec­
essity of spectator spirit and the
Tl
team’s attitude toward the up­
coming game. The rally closed 
with the singing of the Alma 
Mater. The pep rally was an un­
qualified success due to the Tech 
students that saw fit to turn out 
in such large numbers and with 
so much spirit. The Student Con­
gress Tech Committee thanks the 
Cwens, Delta Skull, and Scimitars, 
for their help in the organization 
of the rally.
“TECH-TIME: 2000.” Carnegie 
Tech looks into the future as the 
campus prepares for one of the 
busiest weekends of the year. Fri­
day and Saturday, October 25-26, 
will be devoted to visiting com­
petitive fraternity displays, fea­
turing this theme, attending IM 
and varsity football games and 
Carnegie Day, naming a Fall Fes­
tival queen, making a torch-light 
parade, going to a dance, and, 
among other things, finding a seat 
for the Friday night program in 
the gym,
Judy Henske, a “slightly off­
beat” singer by her own admis­
sion, and Bud and Travis, two 
younk folksingers, will visit the 
campus to give the evening’s in­
formal concert.
Miss Henske, a twenty-four 
year old singer of “anything that 
moves me,” had her big break at 
the Unicorn, a Hollywood coffee 
house owned by Theodore Bikel 
and Herb Cohen. But she admits 
that she became a singer purely 
by accident.
Encouraged by her parents, to 
study art, she pursued painting in 
a succession of schools, including 
the Art Institute of Chicago and 
Oberlin College. “But,” she says, 
“After I had painted for so many 
years, I found I had very little to 
say — or rather, what I had to 
say, I couldn’t express through 
painting.” So she somehow began 
singing folk songs at a nursery 
school in Philadelphia.
From this experience she went 
west, worked for Bikel, and join­
ed Dave Guard’s Whiskey Hill 
Singers. She will appear at the 
Village Gate in New York this 
spring.
Bud and Travis are a duo who 
consider themselves a quartet. 
Travis says, “We play counter- 
melodic movements against the
melodies we sing. Our guitars be­
come two other voices.” The team 
met in 1958 in San Francisco when 
Bud was playing for the Purple 
Onion, and Travis, the hungry i. 
They have written over 400 songs 
between them, and Travis has had 
many of his originals recorded by 
other folk groups. “South Wind” 
was a Kingston Trio hit, and The 
Limelighters will soon release 
“The Time of Man.”
“Too many people put a tragic, 
somber, connotation on folk mu­
sic,” says Bud. “Most of it is just 
the opposite. There is a great 
humor in folk music and Travis 
and I present it this way.”
More details concerning Tech's 
fall weekend will appear in the 
coming issues of the Tartan,
Tuition Increase Helps Finance 
Men’s Dorm Improvements
The residents of Boss, McGill, and Welsh Halls no longer 
wake in the morning with aching backs from sagging mat­
tresses, struggle with sticky desk drawers, or stuff paper 
under the short legs of old rocking bureaus. These dorms j 
have been completely refurnished by Tech at a cost of almost j 
$4300.
Judy Henke
Unfortunately, many of the 
benefits and improvements made 
possible by increased fees are 
never noticeable to the students as 
tangible evidence that they are 
getting their money’s worth; but 
the dorm improvements for this 
year should ease some of the pain 
as each student hands over that 
ever-increasing check at registra­
tion.
The men in Donner Hall initiat­
ed a repainting projetct last year, 
and, with paint supplied by the 
school, completed 48 rooms. Tech 
finished the job this summer, 
spending a total of $4,000 to com­
plete the repainting of all Donner 
rooms except the dozen which 
were still in good condition.
In Mudge Graduate House, Tech 
has spent more than $3,300 con­
verting a lounge and recreation 
area in the addition to provide 
space for 20 more residents, bring­
ing the total spaces in the house 
to 160. Twenty-three hundred 
dollars worth of carpeting has
also been installed, to spare the 
grads the thrill of jumping out of 
bed onto a cold linoleum floor on 
those nippy -18* mornings.
No new improvements were 
made in Henderson Hall, since it 
is uncertain how much longer that 
dorm will remain, but the best 
of the old furniture removed from 
the refurnished dorms was placed 
in Henderson. The rest of the fur­
niture was sold to faculty, stu­
dents, and secondhand dealers, so 
that some income was gained to 
help defray the cost of the project.
It may seem that these im­
provements have been slow in ap­
pearing, but the school has tried 
td obtain the best materials and 
furnishings possible, from the 
standpoints of utility, appearance, 
and durability. Upholding these 
standards requires time and pa­
tience, as well as money, but re­
sults do appear, and they are cer­
tainly worth waiting and paying, 
for.
Offices Open 
In Congress
Each year students complain 
about the ineptness of their stu­
dent government. Yet. each year 
when important posts are open, 
all of those who complain never 
appear to shoulder any responsi­
bility. Below are listed a number 
of important offices, all of which 
are open to any sophomore, jun­
ior. or senior. They have been 
open since late in April of last 
semester and no one has displayed 
any interest. We hope this situa­
tion will not persist. The offices 
which are open are:
Secretary of Executive Council, 
Chairman of Leadership Commit­
tee. Chairman of Student Union 
Committees (female only), Chair­
man of Spring Carnival Commit­
tee, Justice of Student Court.
All of these offices have been 
previously listed in the Tartan, 
announced in Congress, and dis­
played on bulletin boards, so 
everyone should be cognizant in 
the requirements of each. Anyone 
wishing to apply must have a 
written application in to the Ex­
ecutive Council mail box in Dr. 
Strick’s office by no later than 4:30 
Thursday, Oct. 3.

WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE
Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology, 
as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins 
(or insects, a« they are sometimes called).
Where are word origins (insects) to be found? Well sir, some­
times words are proper names which have passed into the 
language. Take, for instance, the words used in electricity: 
ampere was named after its discoverer, the Frenchman Andre 
Marie Ampere (1775-1836); similarly, ohm was named after 
the German G.S. Ohm (1781-1854), wait after the Scot James 
Watt (1736-1819), and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb 
(1843-1912).
There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about 
Mr. Bulb. Until Bulb's invention, all illumination was pro­
vided by gas, which was named after its inventor Milton T. Gas
WH{m tàùtviwc hCitrii lvjort<f
who, strange to tell, had been Bulb’s roommate at Cal Tech! 
In fact, strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with 
Bulb and Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the 
annals of illumination—Walter Candle!
The three roommates were inseparable companions in col­
lege. After graduation all three did research in the problems 
of artificial light, which at this time did not exist. All America 
used to go to bed with the chickens, and many fine citizens were, 
alas, severely injured falling off the roost.
Well sir, the three comrades—Bulb, Gas, and Candle— 
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but 
success, alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the can­
dle, got rich, and forgot his old friends. Then Gas invented gas, 
got rich, bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then 
Bulb invented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot 
his old friends.
Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the ages respec­
tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world’s 
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. Bulb, rich and grand, also 
went to sea, but he went ii* style—as a first-class passenger on 
luxury liners.
Well sir, strange to tell, all three were aboard the ill-fated 
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantic. And 
strange to tell, when they were swimming for their lives after 
the shipwreck, all three clambered aboard the same dinghy I
Well sir, chastened and made wiser by their brush with peril, 
they fell into each other’s arms and wept and exchanged for­
giveness and became fast friends all over again.
For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands 
and singing the Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long 
last, they spied a passing liner and were taken aboard.
They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,’ 
I regret to report, were not many, because the liner which picked 
them up was the Titanic.
What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during the 
lifetimes of Bulb, Gas, and Candle. Had there been Marlboros, 
these three friends never would have grown apart because they 
would have realized how much, despite their differences, they 
still had in common. I mean to say that Marlboros can be lit by 
candle, by gas, and by electricity, and no matter how you 
light them, you always get a lot to like—a filter, a flavor, a 
pack or box that makes anyone—including Bulb, Gas, and Can­
dle—settle back and forswear pettiness and smile the sweet 
¦mile of friendship on all who pass I

Cigarettes, who sponsor this column. We deal in rich to• 
baccos and fine filters. Try a pack soon.

Contract Men Discuss Skibo Food
For the benefit of those who were unable 
to attend the Campus Food Contract meet­
ing, Wednesday night, September 23, to 
voice their questions and complaints, The 
Tartan now presents a potpourri of questions 
and answers heard at the meeting.
Mr. Helms answered for the Campus Food 
Service.
Q: “Why is the service so inefficient? 
When I come for breakfast, I have to wait 15 
minutes.”
A: “We try to serve quality food, so the 
preparation is staggered. We have 125 men 
over those expected. A lot more are coming 
at the same time. Today, we put another girl 
on the breakfast line—but she didn’t know 
anything about breakfast.”
Q: “Why don’t they supply more fresh 
fruit? Twice there were apples — once last 
year and once this year.”
A: “Was there a date on it?”
Q: “Why can’t we be allowed to take 
coffee or tea with another beverage? We 
cannot get milk and coffee for breakfast. Is 
the coffee that expensive?”
A: “The cost of coffee depends on how 
much sugar and cream they put in it. Why 
don’t we just say that we have a problem on 
breakfast.”
Q: “Why can't you serve sandwiches at 
lunch? Preferably a variety.”
A: “It may be a production problem.”
Q: “How come the rolls are so old?” 
Unanswered.
Q: “Why do you put mushrooms in all the 
vegetables? Mushrooms tend to take the 
flavor out of the other food.”
A: “You apparently don’t like mush­
rooms.”
Q: “Couldn’t you put the mushrooms in a 
separate container?”
A: “I think there’s someone else on the
OptDpnu EnHep

plan who doesn’t like mushrooms.”
Q: “How long is this meeting going to 
last — I have homework to do.”
A: “You may leave as soon as you have 
heard enough.”
At this point most students present pick­
ed up a copy of the cancellation form and 
left.
Overheard in the food line at Skibo last 
Sunday when a customer asked for a plate 
of Canadian bacon:
“I’m sorry sir, we don’t have any; this 
is ham.”
Another waitress quickly corrected her: 
“Oh yes, we do, they’re calling the ham 
Canadian bacon today.”
Campus Leader Challenges Axelrad
Editor, The Tartan:
In the interest of the many 
Tech students who participate in 
one or more campus activities 
and who realize the benefits of 
their participation, I find it nec­
essary to reply to the attack on 
activities published in last 
week’s Tartan. Mr. Axelrad, in 
his “Candle in the Darkness,” 
questions the value of our cam­
pus activities. He states that by 
looking about himself the stu­
dent can “pick up social knowl­
edge with a minimum of effort.” 
By social knowledge Mr. Axel­
rad implies an ability to work 
with others, to lead, to follow, 
to compromise, in addition to a 
purely social awareness.
I propose that it takes more 
than a minimum of effort to gain 
this social knowledge. The pro­
cess of osmosis — the soaking in 
of knowledge by casual contact 
¦— is very ineffective. As with 
any other knowledge, the social 
type must be learned by active 
experience. For any of us to 
learn how to work with other 
people, how to lead them and 
how to be led, we must gain this 
kind of experience. A prime pur­
pose of all our campus activities 
is to offer this experience!
Why should I, as a prospective 
engineer or scientist or artist, be 
concerned with social knowl­
edge? Why should I sacrifice 
some valuable study time to par­
ticipate? Why not rely, as Mr. 
Axelrad claims he does, on 
“book knowledge,” and on the 
process of osmosis for contact 
with reality? Our goals in life 
are to meet with success, the 
meaning of success varying from 
person to person. For a very few 
this success might be an iso­
lated existence in a dark corner 
of a lab, out of contact with 
other people. For the rest of us 
our success, whether we measure 
it by pride and happiness with a profession, by financial prog­
ress, or by some other means, 
depends on our relations with 
other people. For instance, Dale
Carnegie states, on the basis of 
studies done here at Carnegie 
Tech, that “about 15 per cent of 
one’s financial success is due to 
technical knowledge and about 85 
per cent is due to sill In human 
engineering — to personality and 
the ability to lead people.”
I contend that human engi­
neering is a fundamental part of 
our college education, and that 
it should be important to every 
student. Every one of us has dif­
ferent interests, and this has led 
to the many varied extracurric­
ular activities on our campus.
There should be few of us who 
do not participate for lack of in­
terest in one or more areas of 
activity.
Why then, do some students 
not participate in any activity? 
Perhaps it is a question of lazi­
ness, overemphasis on academic 
life, or apathy. The student who 
allows any of these to interfere 
with his complete education is 
cheating himself. Yes, Mr. Axel­
rad, this person should feel 
guilty!
I further question the blunt

Some things die — like Frosh-Sophomore competition. 
Here’s what it was like in previgor mortis days: On Monday 
and Tuesday the sophomores required that the freshmen 
swear by their great grandmother’s pipe to obey all re­
quirements of upper classmen, shed all school ties and pins, 
turn coats inside out, and entertain the Human Beings of 
the school. On Friday they captured the plebes, as they were 
known, and pushed them into a tunnel under the design 
building, got their trousers, and occasionally wetted them 
down with a fire hose. On Saturday, the weekended with the 
Sophs beating the Plebes in the annual competition in such 
things as wrestling and Indian ball. One wonders, for that is 
all one can do over a dead thing, of the conditions that in­
spired these things and how they stand in contrast to our 
scepticism. The Tech eleven was to open the next Saturday 
against Penn State. Since our benefactor was alive then, 
the following message was sent by the various class presi­
dents to Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Carnegie, Skibo Castle, Dor­
noch, Sutherland, Scotland: “3100 students of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, upon the opening of the ninth school 
beneficence in opening to them this wide door of opportun- 
beneficence in opening to them this wide door of 
opportunity.”
A Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad
Reserve Books
A problem has been studied by a Senior Industrial 
Management class that should be of enough interest to be 
related here. Previous to this year, reserve books assigned 
for I.M. courses disappeared so rapidly and frequently that 
it was an extremely rare day when an assigned book could 
be found in the stacks. The problem presented was to find 
some solution to the past situation.
One obvious solution would be to have reserve books 
placed behind the desk, and given out only by librarians, j 
Unfortunately, the librarians are unwilling to help in this 
manner. Undoubtedly if they did devote time to such tasks, 
they would have little time left for anything else. New li­
brarians could be hired, but the expense would be great.
Another solution would be to give reserve books to 
class members who were centrally located (in a fraternity 
house, Squirrel Hill, etc.), and have others borrow the books 
from them. This would create problems if other classes or 
individuals decided to use the book although it would still * 
be feasible. Along the same line was the suggestion that the 
I.M.’s chip in and buy books for their use exclusively, but, 
with each book costing about 8 dollars, this would be 
extremely expensive.
Students caught with stolen books are punished severe­
ly by the school—but how many have been caught? A 
remedy to this would be to have class members inform on 
each other with the thieves’ punishment consisting of an R ^ 
in the course. (The student would not be reported to the 
school.) A hand vote was taken on this solution with the 
understanding a “yes” vote bound the student on his “honor” 
to report offenders. The proposal was defeated 13-12. Other 
solutions were also discussed; but no answer was found. The 
problem has defied all attempts to solve it.
The main reason why books are stolen in such quantity 
may be inferred from the results of a poll (taken by secret 
ballot) of the Sr. I.M.’s. Four said they would steal a book r 
before anyone else did, 10 said they would steal in “self-de^ " 
fense”, and 13 claimed they never stole. If these results are 
correct, then an explanation of the stealing can be easily ar­
rived at: A few persons (the four) take books; then others, 
seeing the supply depleted, protect themselves by taking the 
remainder (if any). It is likely that grades are inversely 
proportional to honesty! Perhaps this is so—although it is 
hard to believe that there are 13 honest I.M.’s. The net effect 
on grades may be small. However it would be nice to have a 
system that does not give a premium for dishonesty. [I

Axelrad Receives Opposition 
From ‘Active’ Students
t continued from page 4] 
statement that “the average stu­
dent is apathetic.” The average 
Tech student has an interest in 
^ his education — he is serious
about his studies — and he par­
ticipate in some sort of activity 
outside of hvs academic life. 
There are few students who 
exist apart from campus activi­
ties.
Now the Tech student does 
participate in some activities and 
he is a serious student, so where 
does our notion of “apathy” or 
lack of school spirit arise? It is 
^ obvious that we do not have the
spirit that surrounds a large 
state school, supported by pro­
fessional athletics and students 
with abundant free time.
We have a different kind of 
school spirit. As we participate 
in the various campus activities, 
and as these activities flourish, a 
sense of pride develops around 
them. The importance of the ac­
tivities to the individual student 
becomes an active interest in the 
success of the activities. This 
pride extends even further as 
we develop pride in other activi­
ties — as communication be­
tween the activities and the stu­
dent. body -is successful.
At Tech we do not find an all- 
powerful driving force — school 
spirit. We do find pride in our 
own activities. We do find 400 
students attending a pep rally
and the grandstand full for a 
football game. This is not 
apathy!

Cahill Speaks Exhibit Feature 
OnControversy 0’Hanlon
Of Integration
Reverend Cahill
The Carnegie Tech YM-YWCA is scheduling a varied 
and exciting program for the fall semester which should be 
of interest to the entire Tech community — students, faculty, 
staff and their families.
Two courses, familiar to many Tech students from past 
years, will be offered again this*
fall, Scuba, and speed reading. 
Scuba means Self Contained Un­
derwater Breathing Apparatus. 
Here is an opportunity to learn 
one of the more exciting water 
sports, underwater Scuba diving, 
with competent instruction by ex­
perienced Scuba divers, who are 
supervised by a Certified Scuba 
Instructor. Students provide their 
own mask, snorkel, and fins. Aqua 
lungs are furnished free. The 
class will meet for eight sessions 
from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. on Tues­
day evenings at the Tech pool. 
Each session will consist of one 
hour of lecture and two hours in 
the water. It meets from October 
8 to November 26. The cost for Y 
members is $12.00; non-members 
$15.00. Registration deadline is 
October 4.
Students interested in doubling 
their reading rate, and at the same 
time increasing their degree of 
comprehension have made the 
Speed Reading course the success 
it is. The instructor, as in the past 
years, will be Mr. Regis B. Wie- 
gand, Head of the English Depart­
ment of Taylor Alierdice High 
School and a member of Tech’s 
Night Faculty. He is one of the 
most experienced and successful 
speed reading teachers in Pitts­
burgh. The class will meet for 14 
sessions, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
October 10 - November 7, then 
Thursdays, November and Decem­
ber until December 19, from 6:15 
to 8:15 p.m. in Room 56, Skibo. Y 
members cost is $20.00; non-mem­
bers $25.00; plus testbook of $3.95.
Other facets of the Y program 
attempt to explore the deeper di­
mensions and religious implica­
tions of a wide variety of con­
cerns.
Father Philip Walsh of the Ora­
tory of St. Philip Neri will be 
the opening speaker in the Y 
sponsored “Theological Sampler” 
series, beginning today, October 2, 
from 4:30 - 5:45 p.m. in Room 40, 
Skibo.
A Theological Sampler will 
feature, each Wednesday in Octo­
ber, a clergyman representing one 
of five major American religious 
groups, who will give an introduc­
tory survey of some of the key 
ideas and concepts which are fun­
damental to the tradition he re­
presents. Beginning today with 
Father Walsh representing the
The sculpture of Richard 
O’Hanlon will be on exhibit at 
the Hewlett Gallery, in the Col­
lege of Fine Arts, beginning Mon­
day, September 30, and continu­
ing through Friday, October 18.
An associate professor of sculp­
ture in the art department at the 
University of California at Berke­
ley, Mr. O’Hanlon will also pre­
sent a lecture with slides entitled 
“Visual Notes of a Sculptor” on 
Monday, October 7, at 8:00 p.m. 
in the auditorium of G.S.I.A.
Mr. O’Hanlon’s sculptures ap­
pear in collections of art and
museums throughout the United 
States. Among the museums ex­
hibiting his work are the Addi­
son Gallery of American Art, the
Baltimore Museum of Art, the
Denver Art Museum, and the San
Francisco Museum of Art.

Church of Pittsburgh, will speak 
on the timely and controversial 
topic of integration on Oct. 8 at 
Carnegie Tech’s first assembly 
program of the year. The talk, 
entitled “Tactics of Social
Change”, will be an analysis of 
the methods used by Negro lead­
ers to speed integration and will 
include a discussion of such in­
cidents as the Birmingham vio­
lence and the march on Wash­
ington.
Mr. Cahill was a resident of 
Atlanta, Georgia, for eleven 
years and during that time spent 
several years serving as the min-1 
ister of the only integrated church 
in Atlanta.
During the period 1943-48, Mr.
Cahill was on the staff of the 
Unitarian Service Committee as 
Associate Director and Acting 
Executive Director. In 1946 he 
made two trips to Europe for the 
Committee in connection with the 
refugee relief activities, visiting 
relief projects in France, Swit­
zerland, and Czechoslovakia.
In 1948 he was appointed to 
the position of Executive Direc­
tor of the Department of World 
Churches of the American Uni­
tarian Association, a position 
which he held until November 1,

New YM-YWCA Program 
Offers Scuba And Speed Reading
Roman Catholic tradition, there 
will be a Lutheran, a Jew, an 
Orthodox priest, and one of the 
Calvinist-Reformed tradition.
Father Walsh received his 
licentiate in Theology at St. Mary 
of the Lake Seminary in Chicago. 
He was stationed at three parishes 
in Chicago (adult education), and 
was also Professor of Theology at 
the Oratory Seminary in South 
Carolina for three years.
Following the Theological Sam­
pler Series, on Wednesdays until 
Christmas vacation, Dr. Richard 
Rubenstein will give a series of 
lectures on Kierkegaard, the 19th 
century Danish philosopher and 
theologian, whose ideas formed 
one of the foundations of existen­
tialist thought. Dr. Rubenstein has
done graduate work in both Jew­
ish and Christian theological sem­
inaries and has widely lectured 
in universities in the United 
States, Canada and Europe. There 
will be no charge to members of 
the Y or Hillel; non-members pay 
$3.00 to register for this course. 
The course will begin with an 
open lecture at a Tech Assembly 
on Tuesday, November 5, 11:30 - 
12:30 p.m. in the Little Theater of 
the Fine Arts Building.
An informal discussion group 
designed for those interested in 
deepening the level of their Chris­
tian life will hold weekly discus­
sions centered on the writings of 
men who have been living ex­
amples of their faith, such as 
Dietrich Bonhoeffler. The first 
session will meet Friday, October 
11 at 4:30 in the Y offiee, 57 Skibo. 
Members will decide time for fu­
ture meetings.

Music Students 
Are Victims 
Of New Policy
by Martha Hodgson
The musician’s life is not all 
harmony — it’s not even all har­
mony and theory. A new policy 
this year, introduced by Mr. Sid­
ney Harth, head of the music de­
partment, requires students to at­
tend at least 20 recitals, sponsored 
by the department and given in 
the evening apart from the already 
compulsory convocations, and to 
write a critical analysis of each 
performance. Music students have 
given their lives, fortunes, and 
sacred talents to the muse, and 
generally attend an exhorbitant 
number of concerts, recitals, com­
poser’s forums, in addition to 
string, woodwind, or voice ensem­
ble rehearsals. To the average 
Maggie Murph or E and S man, 
their dedication is fantastic, and 
their anguish over this proposal is 
completely out oi proportion to 
the facts observable. However, the 
artistic temperment, viewed as 
the force which inspires such peo­
ple to attend all these musical 
events,.and the love of music it­
self, may not be coerced, and to 
the recital performers an unsym­
pathetic audience concerned only 
with criticizing the performance 
for their report and not with 
sheer enjoyment of the work, is 
less desirable than not at all. 
Most of these recitals were pre­
viously attended by a small num­
ber of people who came because 
they loved the music played, or 
wanted to hear the performance 
for its merits. The sympathy and 
rapport which was apparent be­
tween performer and audiences 
will be lost under the require­
ments of the new system. Mem­
bers of the department have 
drawn up a petition protesting 
the change.

Spirit was high at the Tech 
Field last Saturday as students 
filled the stands and sat three 
rows deep on the hill to cheer on 
a new Tech lootball team in its 
initial home game of the ’63 sea­
son. But Tech’s loss on the toss 
of the coin proved to be only the 
first disappointment in a long 
series which the Tartans and fans 
were to sustain before a 16-6 vic­
tory was officially recorded for 
the Big Red of Denison Univer­
sity.
The initial series of downs 
proved to set the course of play 
in the entire game as Denison 
drove from their own 15 in eight 
plays from scrimmage and a 25 
yard kickoff return to the Tech 
23 yard line. Working from a 
single wing left and enjoying 
strong offensive blocking, Deni­
son’s Price and Griffin swept over 
left tackle and around left end 
before Jack Wilson’s field goal at­
tempt fell short.
Just as strong blocking and 
powerful running from the single 
wing characterized the Denison 
attack as shown in their first as­
sault, Tech’s lack of effective 
driving and their reliance on the 
powerful toe of Terry Hechler for 
punts became evident from the 
first. Hechler, A1 Abies, and Dave 
Gilchrist could not gain and Tech 
was forced to surrender the ball 
on a punt.
Quick Scoring
Four downs later, Tech’s Dave 
Heil interrupted a Beg Red drive 
with an interception of pass. 
Denison quictdy resumed its of­
fense, however, with an intercep­
tion of a Tech pass and a strong 
running attack which took them 
to the Tech 35. A 34 yard run 
and a 1 yard plunge, both by 
Griffin, gave Denison its first 
touchdown, and with an unsuc­
cessful conversion attempt, they 
led 6-0 with 22:3 left in the first 
quarter.
As if sparked by the deficit, A1 
Abelts returned the kickoff 18 
yards, then took a Wisniewski 
pitch-out and rambled 68 yards 
through the helpless Big Red to 
score for Tech with 1:44 still left 
in the quarter.
The score stood at 6-6 until 
Price swept wide to the left with 
5:56 left in the half and scored 
and Wilson converted to set the 
score at 13-6, in favor of Denison.
