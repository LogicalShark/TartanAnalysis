Mayor pushes for students to stay in Pittsburgh
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
Pittsburgh’s got a new mayor
— and he’s only a few years older 
than a college student.
At 26, Luke Ravenstahl has 
taken a large northeastern city 
under his wing. The ex-city coun­
cil president is confident his age 
will be the last thing on Pitts­
burghers’ minds in a matter of 
months.
“When I first became a city 
councilman, I was the 23-year- 
old city councilman,” he said. 
“Six months into my term, I was 
City Councilman Luke Ravens­
tahl.”
Ravenstahl was sworn in as
mayor on September 1, follow­
ing the death of Bob O’Connor, 
who had taken the office only 
eight months prior. The Pitts­
burgh city charter states that 
if a mayor is unable to finish a 
term, the council president can
accept or decline the post.
Even if Ravenstahl were 56 
and not 26, questions of age 
might still dominate his term as 
mayor. For the mayor, every day 
is a demographic juggling act. He 
is working to keep young Carn­
egie Mellon graduates, whom he 
described as some of the most 
recognized in the world, in Pitts­
burgh. At the same time, he is 
working on a new city budget to

Senate works to fill 
gaps in vacant seats
by Benjamin Hackett
Staffwriter 
& Shawn Fakhari
Junior Staffwriter
With 17 of 38 seats vacant and 
student body executives who 
have missed the first three meet­
ings, Student Senate began the 
year with more than a few holes 
to fill.
As of last Thursday the 
Senate still had six vacant posi­
tions: one for the Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts program, 
one in the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, one in the School 
of Computer Science, and three 
in the College of Fine Arts. A 
remaining Tepper School of 
Business vacancy already has 
a number of petitions, and the 
seat will be voted on within the 
week.
In light of the vacancies, not 
all Senators are optimistic.
“There is general disarray in 
Student Senate,” said Senator 
Kelly Duncan, a junior in phys­
ics and mathematics. “The gen­
eral lack of communication is a 
problem that needs to be fixed
in order for Senate and student 
government to move forward. 
It is the beginning of the year 
and there are more vacancies 
now that I have ever remem­
bered.”
Emily Leathers, a senior in 
computer science and civil and 
environmental engineering, 
also feels that communication is 
an issue of concern.
“There are lots of channels on 
campus where communication 
doesn’t flow as well as it might, 
and one of those is certainly 
between students and Senate,” 
said Leathers, who serves as the 
Senate chair. “While individual 
Senators talk to their friends and 
notice their own pet peeves and 
issues around campus, we need 
to make sure that all students 
are coming forward with their 
concerns.”
Leathers said another issue is 
that Senate focuses on current 
problems to fix, rather than in­
troducing new ideas. Initiating 
new ideas, she said, will “make 
things better without there 
needing to be a problem in the

Study finds MBA students 
are most likely to cheat
by Alexander Dileonardo
Junior Staffwriter
Just as in their profession, 
business students often do any­
thing to get ahead — even in the 
classroom.
A recent study by the Center 
for Academic Integrity (CAI) at 
Duke University found that MBA 
students are the biggest cheats 
in academia.
The study, which distributed 
5300 surveys at 54 colleges and 
universities including Carnegie 
Mellon, revealed that 56 percent 
of students in MBA program ad­
mit to cheating.
The study also found that busi­
ness grad students weren’t the 
only ones cheating: 54 percent 
of engineering students and 50 
percent of science students also 
admitted to academic dishon­
esty on the survey.
A September 21 article in the 
Financial Times reported on the 
study and explained that the
goal in a business school is to 
obtain the best internship or 
job on Wall Street — a goal that 
creates an overly competitive 
environment.
Carnegie Mellon students 
cited specific motives for cheat­
ing in the Tepper School of Busi­
ness, though they are concerned 
about their implications after 
graduation.
Hanish Dayal, a senior major­
ing in chemical engineering and 
business administration, reacted 
strongly in support of the study’s 
implications.
“Many business students sim­
ply see problem sets and other 
work as an obstacle to making 
a six-figure salary at Goldman 
Sachs or some other firm on Wall 
Street,” he said.
In Tepper, Dayal has noticed 
a strong presence of cheating. 
Still, he is optimistic about the 
integrity of business students af­
ter graduation.

The ‘0’ charged with 
racial discrimination
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
Though it left the campus this spring, the 
Original Hot Dog Shop Inc. is facing a lawsuit 
alleging racial discrimination at its Carnegie 
Mellon location.
In a suit filed September 19, the Equal Em­
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 
stated that the parent company of the Origi­
nal Hot Dog Shop, or “the ‘O,’ ” violated fed­
eral law when it fired black employees be­
cause of their race.
The commission filed the suit in 
federal court in Pittsburgh under 
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act and Title I of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1991, which guard against 
unlawful employment practices on 
the basis of race.
According to the document, Bruce 
Simon, general manager of the ‘O’’s 
Carnegie Mellon location, ordered a store 
manager to fire Anton Rumph and other 
African-American employees there.
“Let the truth come out,” Simon said. “That’s 
all I want is the truth.” He made no further

com- 
m e n t s 
regarding 
the charges.
The suit alleges 
that last September, Si­
mon commanded a newly-employed store 
manager to discharge all African-American 
employees.
“This manager indicated that he was told 
by Mr. Simon to fire the black employees be­
cause CMU students did not like to be waited 
on by black employees,” the suit states.
It also notes that Simon claimed to have 
fired the employees because of customer 
complaints, poor performance, and improper 
training.
“However, these claims are not worthy of 
belief and are pretextual for race discrimina­
tion,” the suit states.
Tim Michael, head of Housing and Dining 
Services, noted that Carnegie Mellon is not a 
direct participant. The ‘O’ was a third-party 
vendor, which did not enter into a contract 
directly with the University.
Rather, Parkhurst Food Services, a com­
pany the University hires, draws up contracts 
with food vendors and acts as a liaison to the 
University.
“What was really happening last fall was a 
series of complaints about service,” Michael 
said. “Students were complaining about long 
lines and slow service.”
Michael also noted that Housing and Din­
ing never intervenes with how third-party

Nation’s only bagpipe major is a Tartan
by Justine Rae Lee
Staffwriter
Sophomore Nick Hudson is a typical Carn­
egie Mellon student. He exercises when he 
can, practices his instrument most of the day, 
and eats at half-price almost nightly. He is a 
typical student — except he is the only stu­
dent with his major in North America.
Nick Hudson studies the bagpipes.
In addition to receiving a music scholarship 
and subsidized kilts, Hudson’s experience at 
Carnegie Mellon includes playing an instru­

On Thursday afternoons, Hudson and 
Alasdair Gillies, his instructor, prepare for an 
hour-long lesson in which Hudson will tune 
his bagpipes and review pieces from the pre­
vious week’s lesson. Gillies is the director of 
bagpiping in the College of Fine Arts. He has 
also been considered, by those in the field, to 
be one of the greatest bagpipers alive.
The weekly lessons are held in the base­
ment of the University Center, in a room 
scarcely adorned. Just a few framed photo­
graphs line the walls. One that particularly 
stands out is of a bold-looking man dressed in 
a kilt, sporting a thick mustache and holding 
bagpipes.
“You see that? That’s a picture of one of An­
drew Carnegie’s personal bagpipers,” Gillies 
said. “He brought him from Skibo Castle with 
him to the States.”
Gillies went on to describe the piper’s duty 
of waking up Carnegie with the same tune 
every morning.
Gillies, who was taught by his father from
age five and later served as a military piper in 
the British army, describes the instrument as 
having an “X-factor.”
“This factor has to be discovered by the 
person playing it, and a lot of it is either you 
got it or you don’t,” Gillies said. He believes

Lecturers to speak about global labor and rise of civil rights
by James Tetlow
Staffwriter
This week, lectures at 
Carnegie Mellon W'ill focus 
on the modern representa­
tion of global labor issues and 
on understanding one of the 
“missing chapters” in the civil 
rights movement. Thursday, the 
Literary and Cultural Studies 
Colloquium Series will pres­
ent a lecture on global labor 
by professor Michael Denning. 
The Center for Africanamerican 
Urban Studies and the Economy 
(CAUSE) will launch its 2006- 
07 Speaker Series on Friday 
with a lecture on the rise of civil 
rights in Phoenix.
This Thursday evening, pro­
fessor Michael Denning will 
focus on how to represent glob­
al labor imaginatively, cultural­
ly, and politically. Each section 
of this three-part lecture will 
examine a different perspective 
on the issue.
In the first section, Denning 
will consider whether represent­
ing global labor requires two 
arguably crucial breakthroughs: 
a new abstraction of labor and 
work that categorizes “work­
ers” and a new, modern sense 
of the “international.” Denning 
will then look at two relatively 
contemporary representations 
of global labor: the photo­
graphs of Sebastiao Salgado, a 
Brazilian photojournalist who 
has documented manual labor 
worldwide; and the graphs and 
pie charts of the 1995 World 
Bank report. Finally, Denning 
will address the sense of imagi­
native crisis that has led many

Reflecting on life 
in light of loss
Yankiver
This past week marked the first 
anniversary of my good friend Jared 
Branfman’s passing after his long bat­
tle against cancer. Jared was an avid 
cyclist, so getting on my bike to ride to 
class on the anniversary left me missing 
him. As I locked my bike in front of the 
UC, a Relay for Life team was raising 
money for cancer research.
Seeing the volunteers giving their 
time lifted my spirits and restored my 
hopes. I send my most sincere appre­
ciation and congratulations to all the 
Relay for Life teams and volunteers who 
participated this past week.
Below is an excerpt of the column I 
composed one year ago.
As I began to process this experi­
ence, I realized how removed I am from 
the notion of death. Mortality, perhaps 
our most intrinsic trait, is foreign to so 
many of us.
For years, my mother warned me 
that I wasn’t invincible. Never breaking 
a bone, never visiting the emergency 
room, I found it difficult to consider or 
even conceive of the end of life. I had 
experienced the loss of three grand­
parents, but death still seemed a very 
abstract and distant phenomenon. Only 
the most direct confrontations with 
death have led me to accept it as an 
intrinsic part of life.
The summer after graduating high 
school, I began working the graveyard 
shift at an emergency room south of 
Boston. Along with many menial duties, 
I was responsible for being the extra 
hands of doctors and surgeons in the 
trauma room.
I can’t remember specifically when I 
first witnessed a person’s death, but I 
remember that it wasn’t what I expect­
ed: It was unremarkable and natural. 
Death was not dramatic or frightening, 
as television and movies had led me to 
believe.
I was present for the passings of many 
people, but it was one case in particular 
that forced me to confront the fact that 
what I witnessed happening to others 
applied to me too.
A young man was once brought to 
the emergency room after becoming 
unconscious at a party. He had been 
using the drug called Special K — 
ketamine. I searched through his pock­
ets for identification and found his 
driver’s license. He was 18 years 
old — just a few months younger than 
I was.
The boy’s heart stopped beating 
shortly after he arrived. Quickly, the 
calm disconnect that I inherited from 
my colleagues and my culture washed 
over me. Working around him, some­
thing clicked. The feeling of numbness 
scared me more than the experience 
itself.
Friends and family would react with 
surprise and aversion when I told them 
about my job. Death isn’t something 
people my age should have to deal 
with, nearly all of them said. It is the 
same reaction I got when friends and 
family spoke to me about my grandpar­
ents’ deaths. I can’t help but feel that 
this choreographed response reflects 
our culture’s practice of ignoring death, 
denying for as long as possible its inevi­
tability.
Of course, life experiences and grad­
ual exposure can soften the blow dealt 
by the realities of our mortal condition, 
but avoiding the issue does more harm 
than good. Accepting life for what it is 
need not be morbid; it is brave, and it 
is healthy.
For many of us in our late teens and 
early 20s, the loss of a loved one who 
is close to us in age is not within our 
experience set. Naturally, the emotions 
that come with that loss are new and 
confusing. Most important is that we 
accept and address our feelings.
As I came to realize these things, I 
also realized that Jared knew them. He 
lived every moment looking forward. 
He laughed and loved every day. Jared’s 
life was as short as a beat of a blue jay’s 
wing — and as vigorous. His life was 
as long as the sun’s — and as brilliant. 
Jared, you are still with us always.

THE TARTAN • OCTOBER 2, 2006
Only bagpipe major in U.S. studies at Carnegie Mellon
HUDSON, from A1
that Hudson has it — but just 
needs some push.
“I was brought up around the 
music. Nick wasn’t, so he has to 
go the extra mile to find that abil­
ity to express,” Gillies said. “It’s a 
gift and so far signs say that Nick 
has part of that gift.”
College and kilts
Although he was not raised in 
Scotland, where playing the bag­
pipes is as common as learning to 
play the piano in America, Hud­
son’s interest in the instrument 
came early.
“When my elementary school 
band sent a sheet around ask­
ing what instrument we wanted 
to play, I always went for ‘Other’ 
and wrote in ‘Bagpipes,’ ” Hudson 
said. “I just always liked the way 
it sounded.”
Because there were no bag­
pipe instructors in his area, Hud­
son did not get his start until he 
was 13. He found an eight-week 
group lesson through the com­
munity paper.
Once he was in high school, 
he found a consistent instructor 
and began competing in local 
competitions hosted by the East­
ern United States Pipe Band As­
sociation. Slowly he worked his 
way up from grade 5, the lowest 
skill level, to grade 1, which is
the highest skill level below the 
professional level.
“The competition aspect is re­
ally fun,” Hudson said. In these 
competitions, every participant 
must wear a kilt. Hudson said 
competitors— including men in 
their 40s who play just to get in 
touch with their Scottish ances­
try—play at every level.
During, high school, Hud-
“I’m only getting 
publicity because 
I’m the only one — 
not because of my 
mad piping skills.”
— Nick Hudson
son had also found interest in 
graphic design and was even 
considering pursuing a college 
degree in it.
However, when it came time 
to make his decision, he could 
not turn down the opportunity, 
he said, to learn from the great 
Alasdair Gillies at a school as 
prestigious as Carnegie Mellon.
“Even if another U.S. college 
had bagpipes as a major, if they 
didn’t have someone compa­
rable to Alasdair, then I prob­
ably wouldn’t have considered
it,” Hudson said. “He is the best 
there is.”
Now that Hudson is at Carne­
gie Mellon, Gillies is not afraid to 
return the praise. “It’s an expe­
rience and a half teaching Nick. 
He’s a very keen student, and he’s 
a very good student at learning 
music quickly and reproducing 
the music the way I want him to,” 
he said.
Hudson takes bagpipe-related 
electives, including bagpipe his­
tory and bagpipe maintenance, 
along with all the required 
courses for music performance 
majors. He plays in the Carnegie 
Mellon Kiltie Band, for events 
ranging from weddings to funer­
als upon request, and continues 
to compete at the grade 1 level as 
a solo piper.
He has also found time to pur­
sue his other interests. He is do­
ing the five-year music education 
program, which will certify him 
to teach general music for grades 
K-12. Hudson is also considering 
a minor in music technology and 
taking classes in design.
“What this degree does is it 
makes you a good musician, not 
just a good bagpiper. It increases 
your knowledge of music as a 
whole,” Hudson said.
Gillies has confidence in the 
degree too.
“I see a bright future for Nick. 
With a degree from CMU, he is 
head and shoulders above any­
one in qualifications in the 'pip­
ing world,” he said.
National recognition
Hudson still has two years be­
fore he finishes his degree in bag- 
piping, but he has already been 
approached by The Wall Street 
Journal and by Steve Hartman of 
the CBS Evening News’ Assign­
ment America for interviews. The 
publicity, Hudson insisted, hasn’t 
affected him.
“Seriously, it doesn’t really 
mean anything to me. I think of it 
only as promotion for my career,” 
Hudson said.
“I’m only getting publicity 
because of the fact that I am 
at CMU and I’m the only one
— not because of my mad piping 
skills.”
Gillies doesn’t mind the press 
either, although he joked that 
Hartman, who interviewed him 
for the CBS Evening News seg­
ment, wasn’t bright enough to 
understand what'Gillies was say­
ing through his thick Scottish ac­
cent.
“He thought I was speaking 
French. What a guy,” he said.
“It’s good to publicize the in­
strument and the fact that we of­
fer it here. It shouldn’t be taken 
lightly,” Gillies said. “People 
dedicate their whole life to the 
instrument, and that’s why Nick 
and I are both here.”
Study finds MBA students cheat more than any group
CHEATING, from A1
“I don’t think many students 
will be acting dishonestly in their 
post-grad careers,” Dayal said. 
“I think cheating on homework 
and such is pardonable to many 
because it seems so petty and in­
significant.”
Andrew Williams, a first-year 
MBA student and fourth-year 
electrical and computer engi­
neering Ph.D. student, has a 
more positive outlook on the 
business school.
“I haven’t seen any cheating 
[in the business school],” he said. 
“I have TAed classes in engineer­
ing and caught people cheating.” 
Still, Williams admits that 
there is cause for MBA students 
to be more likely to cheat.
“People who go for MBAs are 
looking to get ahead and look­
ing for any edge they can get. In 
other majors, the focus is more
on things like research,” he said.
John H. Mather, executive di­
rector of the master’s program 
at Tepper, admits that MBA stu­
dents do operate under special 
circumstances that could make 
them more likely to be academi­
cally dishonest.
To avoid dishonest behavior, 
Carnegie Mellon MBA students 
are required to take a course in 
ethics. “We start with ethics in 
orientation,” Mather said. “We 
want students to be sensitized to 
it.”
Mather acknowledges that 
cheating exists in the MBA pro­
gram at Carnegie Mellon, but 
believes that an emphasis on, 
community and awareness helps 
cut down on the number of in­
stances.
“We avoid cheating by em­
phasizing community,” he said. 
“The support is there. We don’t 
have a really competitive pro­
gram. We don’t emphasize 
grades.”
Additionally, Mather believes 
that academic dishonesty may 
arise by accident when a student 
has unclear expectations about 
the scope of an assignment. Pro­
fessors in the business school 
work to make sure every student 
has a clear understanding of 
the policy on collaboration at 
the beginning of every assign­
ment.
Mather said that the Tepper 
faculty makes efforts to limit 
the cheating problem to a 
very small and manageable situ­
ation.
Holly Hippensteel, associate 
director of Student Affairs, con­
firmed Mather’s assessment.
“It’s hard to say that one major 
such as business sees more cheat­
ing,” she said. “In my experience, 
there seem to be patterns in spe­
cific courses. There are semes­
ters where we see more reports 
in Intro to World History, for 
example, or other introductory 
level courses.”
Hippensteel reviews issues of 
academic dishonesty at Carnegie 
Mellon. Her involvement ranges 
from meeting with those ac­
cused of cheating to organizing a 
review board for each individual 
case.
“Cheating at Carnegie Mellon 
is not a huge problem, but any 
problem is more than we want,” 
Hippensteel said.
The CAI study found that, 
in addition to MBA programs, 
cheating is on the rise through­
out the academic community.
“Bad as it is in graduate pro­
grams, even more cheating is re­
ported in undergraduate degree 
programs,” stated the Financial 
Times article. “And high school 
students, it would seem, are even 
worse.”
News in Brief
Campus robbery in daylight
Last Monday, a Carnegie 
Mellon student reported that 
he was robbed in the Univer­
sity Center after using the 
ATM near Entropy.
After withdrawing money 
from the ATM between 2 and 
2:30 p.m., thestudentreported 
that he used the first-floor re­
stroom near McConomy Au­
ditorium. While entering a 
stall, he was approached from 
behind and knocked down. 
The offender then stole his 
wallet.
Because the culprit ap­
proached the victim from be-
hind, the victim could only 
describe him as a white male 
with dark hair, 20-30 years 
old and six feet tall.
The victim was taken to 
UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, 
treated for minor injuries, and 
released.
University Police request 
that, if students see this sus­
pect or anyone resembling 
him, particularly in or near 
the University Center, or have 
any information that might 
assist police in this case, they 
contact them at (412) 268- 
2323.
Smoking ban passes for now
Allegheny County Council 
assed a bill last Tuesday that 
would ban smoking in restau­
rants, bars, and other work­
places.
But the next day, the state 
Senate voted to override the 
provisions in the measure that 
barred smoking in slots par­
lors.
On the other hand, Allegh­
eny County Chief Executive 
Dan Onorato says he will 
veto the bill if it does not ap­
ply to Pittsburgh slot machine
casinos.
Permitting smoking in ca­
sinos, Onorato said in a Pitts­
burgh Post-Gazette article, 
would give casinos an unfair 
advantage over restaurants 
and bars.
Onorato will review the 
bill’s amendments before de­
ciding to sign the veto.

Alum to invest in Delphi Corp.
Carnegie Mellon alumnus 
David A. Tepper has recently 
pledged to bring auto-parts gi­
ant Delphi Corp. out of bank­
ruptcy protection.
Tepper is a 1982 graduate 
of the Graduate School of In­
dustrial Administration, now 
the Tepper School of Business, 
which bears his name. Tepper 
donated a record $55 million 
to the University in spring 
2004.
In his latest business ven­
ture, Tepper would invest bil­
lions of dollars in Delphi, a 
company which manufactures 
mobile electronics as well as 
transportation components 
and systems technology. If the 
agreement goes through, Tep:
per will end up controlling up 
to one-third of Delphi’s stock 
when it emerges from bank­
ruptcy.
The company’s former par­
ent corporation is General Mo­
tors.
Tepper made his fortune 
by investing in failing compa­
nies and declining industries. 
When the steel and coal indus­
tries began to fail, he invested 
in them, and later bought se­
curities of firms facing asbes­
tos suits.

Original Hot Dog Shop faces lawsuit after firing African-American employees
LAWSUIT, from A1
restaurants run their business, 
though they do make manag­
ers aware when there hive been 
complaints.
“We had no complaints about 
service at the ‘O’ based on the 
race of the employees,” he said. 
The ‘O,’ which is known for its
burgers and fries, closed on Carn­
egie Mellon’s campus this spring 
after it did not reach contractual 
agreements with Parkhurst. Si 
Senor took its location in the Uni­
versity Center.
Jane Fahringer, the head of 
Parkhurst during the alleged in­
cident, was unable to be reached 
for comment.
Parkhurst controls contracts 
with all campus dining vendors, 
except four. Gullifty’s in Squirrel 
Hill owns the Underground, Sk- 
ibo Café, Andy’s, and the Zebra 
Lounge, and the manager reports 
directly to the University.
The ‘O’ currently owns two 
other restaurants, one on Forbes 
Avenue in Oakland, which is up
for sale, and one in Plum bor­
ough.
An African-American worker 
at the restaurant’s Oakland lo­
cation, who wished to remain 
anonymous, found no basis 
in the suit’s claims and said 
the workers were “fired be­
cause they [weren’t] doing their 
jobs.”
The worker also noted that 
the current manager of the ‘O’ 
in Oakland is African-American.
The commission is seeking to 
have a jury trial, to have the com­
pany compensate the employees 
for monetary losses, and to be 
granted unspecified compensa­
tory and punitive damages. As of 
publication, a trial date had not
been set.
“With the diversity of this 
campus, I think our campus 
community is a very open and 
accepting place, so I’m surprised 
by the whole thing,” Michael 
said.
“Even the allegation surprises 
me — it’s just not what our cam­
pus is about.”

THE TARTAN • OCTOBER 2, 2006
Mayor to focus on college studentsSenate aims to fill seats, increase communication
Courtesy of the mayor's, office
MAYOR, from A1
meet the costly needs of an aging 
resident population. He is also 
handling intense scrutiny over 
his age.
“The sooner I am referred to as 
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl — and 
not the 26-year-old mayor — the 
better,” he said. “My age can be 
an asset. I plan to use it to my ad­
vantage.”
Only a year after his election 
to city council in January 2004, 
Ravenstahl was elected city 
council president in a compro­
mise after a more experienced 
ally, Jim Motznik, failed to get 
enough votes.
“Things have been on the fast 
track, so to speak, but I continue 
to take it one step at a time,” he 
said.
Accordingly, restraint and cau­
tion has marked his actions, as 
he attempts to keep a financially 
struggling city on an even keel 
after the death of the much-loved 
O’Connor.
“I’ve never gotten too far ahead 
of myself and thought, ‘Oh, I can 
do this or do that,’ ” he said. “It 
works best if I do the best job I 
can as mayor each day, and then 
hopefully the residents of Pitts­
burgh will be happy.”
This civil-service instinct and 
devotion to Pittsburgh might be 
in Ravenstahl’s blood. He comes 
from a family of Pittsburgh poli­
ticians: His father was a district 
judge, and his grandfather was a 
state representative.
The mayor attended North 
Catholic High School in Pitts­
burgh’s North Side, where he was 
a kicker on the football team. 
From there, he went to the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh for a year 
before transferring to Washing­
ton & Jefferson College in Wash­
ington, Pa. After graduating with 
a degree in business administra­
tion, he began a career in sales. 
Shortly thereafter, politics beck­
oned.
“When the opportunity arose 
for myself to run for city council, 
I gladly accepted that challenge,” 
he said. “If you [would have] told 
me that I was going to be mayor 
when I was finishing college, I 
would have told you that you 
were crazy.”
Only four years removed from 
finishing college, he said he could 
relate to the needs of an impor­
tant demographic for the city.
“Allegheny County is an older 
community, but the city limits
in Pittsburgh actually has a high 
population of youth and young 
professionals,” he said.
With this in mind, Ravenstahl 
met with Carnegie Mellon Presi­
dent Jared Cohon last Monday to 
discuss issues affecting the col- 
lege-age population.
“I didn’t think as much about 
his age after we met,” said Co­
hon. “What impressed me most 
was that he was pushing for spe­
cifics, specifics for creating job 
opportunities and an environ­
ment to keep young people.”
Ravenstahl’s realistic view of 
his potential also impressed Co­
hon.
“[The mayor] is aware of the 
limits on what the government 
can do,” Cohon said. “They don’t 
create jobs. They create the en­
vironment for others to create 
jobs.”
The numbers might be on 
Ravenstahl’s side in the fight to 
keep youth in Pittsburgh.
A September 14 report in The
Economist noted that since the 
early ’80s Pennsylvania has be­
come the state with the second- 
oldest population in the country, 
with Allegheny County being the 
oldest section. But the U.S. Cen­
sus Bureau noted in its 2000 cen­
sus that Pennsylvania’s over-64 
population will grow less than 
any other state over the next 25 
years, while the country’s elderly 
population as a whole will grow 
twice as rapidly.
Ravenstahl mentioned some 
specifics for creating job oppor­
tunities for graduates, hoping to 
take advantage of statistics like 
these.
“If we have a student from 
CMU presented with the oppor­
tunity to intern with organiza­
tions as a sophomore or junior, 
whether it’s programs with 
UPMC, Highmark, some of the 
banking institutions, or medical
fields, my hope is that familiarity 
will begin to develop,” he said.
The mayor also hopes that a 
student taking advantage of in­
ternship programs would natu­
rally fit into a full-time position 
in Pittsburgh down the road.
Ravenstahl also mentioned a 
desire to start a youth advisory 
commission for college students. 
These commissions are relatively 
common at the high-school level, 
but non-existent for college stu­
dents.
To the man who is only a few 
years out of school, age is just a 
number. He has taken this theme 
across the country in the open­
ing weeks of his ascendancy to 
mayor. From the bright lights of 
press conference flashbulbs to 
the even brighter lights of the 
David Letterman show on Sep­
tember 9, Ravenstahl is trying to 
change the conventional wisdom 
on a city’s very identity.
“Mr. Ravenstahl is a young 
man taking over an old steel town
that has lost all its mills, nearly 
half its population, and much of 
its downtown commercial dis­
trict in the last several decades,” 
stated The New York Times in a 
September 9 article.
The Times is subscribing to 
a decades-old notion in calling 
Pittsburgh an “old steel town.” 
The Allegheny Times reported 
on September 21 that the col­
lege population now eclipses 
the over-65 population by about 
3000 people.
“I had the opportunity to do 
some national media appear­
ances. This is great because 
it gives us the opportunity to 
tell our story nationwide, that 
our college students agree that 
[Pittsburgh] is a great place to 
live,” said Ravenstahl.
Recent security issues in the 
city threaten to put a damper on 
any such consensus. In response 
to questions about the recent 
shooting on the Duquesne Uni­
versity campus, Ravenstahl cited 
his budget proposal. “I am com­
mitted to getting the number of 
officers on the street back to 900. 
I think that’s important because 
our police force has continued 
to decline over the years,” said 
Ravenstahl, who grew up in a 
community of police officers and 
firefighters. The number of po­
lice in the city hit a low of 845 
this year.
With his budget proposal, Ra­
venstahl also said he wants to 
continue many of the initiatives 
that his predecessor O’Connor 
began. His $429 million budget 
was described by the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette in a September 28 
editorial as “not a radical depar­
ture.”
“It could be a defining moment 
for a politician who is a blank 
slate for most Pittsburghers, and 
who may face voters as early 
as next year,” stated the Post- 
Gazette in a September 18 
article, referring to his budget 
proposal.
“I envision downtown as a 
place for young professionals to 
congregate, gather, and spend 
time together,” said Ravenstahl, 
also hinting at plans for the Fifth 
and Forbes corridor to become 
more residential.
SENATE, from A1
first place.”
Duncan and fellow Senator 
Alan Eaton blamed vacancies 
on a variety of reasons, includ­
ing Senate failures in setting 
up last year’s elections, low 
voter turnout, and a general feel­
ing that Senate has a negative 
public image. Eaton is a junior in 
ethics, history, and public policy, 
and public policy and manage­
ment.
The Senators also noted a dis­
connect between the legislative 
and executive branches of stu­
dent government.
Much of the confusion stems 
from the lack of attendance of 
Student Senate meetings by ex­
ecutive leaders, Student Body 
President Karl Sjogren and Vice- 
President Andrea Hamilton. Sjo­
gren and Hamilton have missed 
the first three Student Senate 
meetings.
“Their lack of attendance is 
disrespectful to us and their 
constituents,” said one Senator, 
who wished to remain anony­
mous.
Yet, not all Senators point the 
finger of blame in the same di­
rection.
“Communication is a two-way 
street,” Eaton said. He noted 
that even without Sjogren and 
Hamilton’s regular attendance 
at Senate meetings, he feels “in­
formed on their focus.”
Sjogren and Hamilton justi­
fied their absence.
“We’re very happy with how 
things are going so far,” Hamil­
ton said.
She also cited several projects 
the executive branch has in the 
works. They are planning to 
tackle long-standing issues such 
as campus space scarcity, dining,
and housing.
In addition, the Sjogren-Ham- 
ilton administration also has 
new agenda items, including re­
forming the University Disciplin­
ary Committee and web-based 
development projects.
One such initiative, the 
CarnegieWiki, would pro­
vide students with an in­
formational resource, serve 
as a replacement for misc.mar­
ket, and deliver an area for 
student organizations to put 
information out in a central set­
ting.
“People tell you that you 
cannot get things done,” 
Hamilton said, referring to the 
perception that student govern­
ment is ineffective, “[but] we 
are doing well at accomplishing 
things.”
While some in Student Senate 
complain that the lack of atten­
dance by the executive branch 
is a negative thing, Hamilton 
offers a different perspective on 
governmental priorities.
“[The executive branch] 
should attend [Student Senate 
meetings] when there is some­
thing pressing on the agenda 
and not just to be a warm body,” 
Hamilton said.
Hamilton said the executive 
branch prioritizes pressing is­
sues and those which actively 
call for their attention over 
standing meetings.
Meanwhile, Senate is looking 
to new blood to lead the charge. 
Currently, more than half of 
the members-at-large on Senate 
are first-year students. There is 
also an increasing Greek pres­
ence on Senate, with Phi Kappa 
Theta and Sigma Phi Epsilon 
brothers holding numerous 
seats.
“It is great to see [Greek mem­
bers] filling their duties to the 
community,” said Eaton, a Phi 
Kappa Theta brother. “I’d like 
to see more Greek women in­
volved.”
Editor’s Note: Kelly Duncan is 
a member of The Tartan’s photo 
staff and staffwriter Ben Hackett 
is a former Senator.
“My age can be an asset. I plan 
to use it to my advantage.”

2 October 2006THE TARTANA6
by Sarah Mogin
Assistant Pillbox Editor
Paul Klee, an early 20th- 
century artist, once said, “Art 
does not reproduce the visible, 
it makes things visible.” Art has 
a way of capturing the unfath­
omable, of translating emotions 
beyond the capabilities of sci­
ence and theory. But art can 
do more than explain our feel­
ings; it can help explain our 
minds.
Aesthetics, the study of 
personal taste, has always 
been a subject of philosophi­
cal debate. Probably the 
most argued aesthetic 
concept is the origin of 
beauty: Is it really in the 
eye of the beholder, or is 
beauty a specific quality, 
independent of its audi­
ence?
In recent years, neu­
roesthetics emerged 
as a branch of aesthet­
ics equipped with poten­
tial new answers to this 
question. Semir Zeki, part 
of the Wellcome Department 
of Imaging Neuroscience at 
University College in London, 
pioneered the field of neuroes­
thetics in order to fill a void in 
the general study of beauty.
“I am convinced that there 
can be no satisfactory theoryH| can be no satisfactory theory
Segway in the city: Tourists need 
not walk to get around town
of aesthetics that is not neuro- 
biologically based,” wrote Zeki 
in “Artistic Creativity and the 
Brain,” an essay in a 2001 issue 
of Science.
The realm of visual art con­
tains some compelling examples 
of works relevant to the proper­
ties of the brain.
Piet Mondrian’s famous com­
positions of primary colors on 
white canvases separated by 
black, horizontal, and vertical 
lines were the artist’s attempt to 
uncover the essence of form.
Years after Mondrian created 
his works, neurobiologists dis­
covered orientation-selective 
cells, cells in the brain that only 
react to straight lines. Scien­
tists now consider orientation- 
selective cells as the most basic 
components of form perception.
“This is why I believe that art­
ists are, in a sense, neurologists 
who unknowingly study the 
brain with techniques unique 
to them,” wrote Zeki. However, 
artists are not alone in their 
exploration of the brain. In 
2003, Zeki and research partner 
Hideaki Kawakbata conducted 
an experiment, “Neural Corre­
lates of Beauty,” out of Univer­
sity College.
Their purpose was to uncover 
whether the same part of the 
brain reacts to paintings, both 
beautiful and ugly, regardless of 
their type (portrait, landscape,
File Photo
still life, or abstract). Ten par­
ticipants monitored via a 2T 
Magnetom Vision fMRI scan­
ner rated each of 196 paintings 
by pressing one of three buttons 
corresponding to the three cat­
egories.
For a portion of their analysis, 
Zeki and Zawakbata ignored the 
four types of paintings and con­
sidered parts of the brain that 
were activated by judgments of 
beauty and ugliness.
They detected four areas of 
heightened activity: the medial 
orbito-frontal cortex, the anteri­
or cingulate, the parietal cortex, 
and the motor cortex.
Of these, the orbito-frontal 
cortex and the motor cortex sus­
tained an increase in activity 
when recognizing beauty and 
ugliness, respectively.
Zeki and Zawakbata’s discov­
ery answered the question that 
had originally motivated the 
research. The data indicates 
there are specific brain areas 
that become active during judg­
ments of beauty and ugliness 
regardless of the type of art 
being evaluated. Thus the eval­
uation of beauty must be neuro- 
logically tied to the observer.
“All human activity is ulti­
mately a product of the organi­
zation of our brains, and subject 
to its laws,” Zeki stated.

Fred Anderson bought his first 
Segway the moment they were 
introduced in Pittsburgh. He 
started giving tours and dem­
onstrations to other people who 
were interested. Soon he was 
buying more Segways.
Now, Anderson, along with 
Earlene Woods, is co-founder of 
Segway In Paradise, a company 
that provides guided tours of 
Pittsburgh on Segways and sells 
used Segways.
Unveiled in December 2001, 
the Segway is a two-wheeled 
transportation device that is 
electrically powered and self- 
balancing. Once someone steps 
onto the Segway’s platform and 
grabs the handlebar, the machine 
is ready to go. All the user has to 
do is lean in the direction he or 
she wants to move and the Seg­
way will move. Leaning forward 
causes the machine to move for­
ward; leaning backwards causes 
it to move backwards. On newer 
models, leaning left and right 
will make the Segway turn in 
that direction.
In September 2003, Segway 
Inc. issued a voluntary product 
recall of 6000 Segway Human 
Transporter (HT) units. Seg­
way found that when some units 
were near the end of their bat­
tery life, they failed to deliver 
enough power and caused the 
rider to fall.
On September 14, the com­
pany announced another recall, 
this time of all 23,500 of their 
units. Now called the Segway 
Personal Transporter (PT), 
units could “unexpectedly ap­
ply reverse torque to the wheels, 
which can cause a rider to fall.”
Segway In Paradise was noti­
fied by representatives of Seg­
way Inc. of the recall within an 
hour of it being issued. Segway 
In Paradise in turn notified 
people who had purchased used 
Segways that had been recalled. 
Both issues were fixed with a free 
software upgrade. Representa-

tives from the company would 
arrive and reload software on 
the machine.
In the 2003 recall, the units 
would fail only when riders 
continued to ride the machine 
despite a repeated low battery 
warning. “The machine starts 
shaking and beeping and you 
have about 10 seconds to get off,” 
Anderson said. “These people 
would wait two or three minutes 
and ride the machine again until 
it shut down.”
As for the recent recall, the 
unit would only malfunction if 
it was “tilted back and the rider 
comes off and then back onto 
the device within a short period 
of time,” according to Anderson. 
Once again, injured riders did 
not follow the Segway’s operat­
ing instructions.
Anderson had his own take on 
the possible malfunction. “We 
could never get it to do what it 
claimed to do,” said Anderson. 
“Segway found this by beating 
to death a new machine. It’s al­
most impossible to do it.”
Perhaps it is this commitment 
to safety on Segway Inc.’s part 
that helps to explain how the 
machines have spread all over 
the world. Atlanta, Chicago, 
New Orleans, and Washington 
are only a few of the many cities 
across the country where tours 
are given on Segways. There are
even tours being conducted in 
San Francisco and Key West, Fla., 
where Segways are banned.
But the Segway isn’t purely 
for recreational purposes. It was 
also designed for use in security 
applications by police depart­
ments or the military.
There are more than 150 law 
enforcement agencies that use 
Segways for patrols. The Chi­
cago Police Department plans to 
purchase 100 more Segways in 
the next five years in addition to 
the 50 they already use to patrol 
the city. As for Pittsburgh, resi­
dents have yet to see officers pa- 
troling downtown via Segway; 
for now, it’s only been tourists.
The Segway In Paradise tours 
cost $49 and last about two 
hours, including a 20-minute 
training session. Riders get to 
see the downtown area of the 
city, including Heinz Field, PNC 
Park, Station Square, Point State 
Park, PPG Plaza, and the Cul­
tural District.
The tours are usually held 
twice a day, at 9:30 a.m. and 2 
p.m., although special appoint­
ments can be scheduled with the 
company.
Currently, Segway In Paradise 
is supplying a dozen units to set 
up a Segway obstacle course for 
the Carnegie Science Center as 
part of the SciTech Spectacular 
program scheduled for October.
Pitt unveils new $6.1M 
nanofabrication facility
by Michael M. Whiston
Asst. Science & Technology Editor
Small science is getting big­
ger. Last Friday, University of 
Pittsburgh officials unveiled a 
$6.1 million nanofabrication 
facility.
The facility will supplement 
the already-existing Petersen 
Institute for NanoScience and 
Engineering on Pitt’s campus.
From improvements in com­
puter storage to the invention of 
glucose-sensory contact lenses, 
scientists are turning from the 
notion that “bigger is better” 
to researching phenomena on a 
much smaller scale.
“Nano-” means one-billionth. 
The Petersen Institute works 
with materials that are “essen­
tially nano,” meaning less than 
10 nanometers (billionths of a 
meter) in size.
Nanofabrication is the pro­
cess of manipulating materials
at the atomic level.
The University of Pittsburgh 
was recently ranked second in 
the nation for nanotechnology 
research by Small Times, a mag­
azine focused on the business 
end of nanotechnology.
Pitt’s new nanofabrication 
facility is meant to promote 
research and education in nano­
science and nanotechnology.
The 4000-square-foot build­
ing is equipped with state-of- 
the-art tools that will allow 
researchers to observe and test 
samples of materials consisting 
of only a few atoms.
But it is not as easy as it may 
sound. Seeing the nanoworld 
requires a special set of micro­
scopes and laser systems.
In particular, the facility’s 
transmission electron micro­
scope allows researchers to pro­
duce an atomic-level image of 
materials. The facility’s plasma

Equipment like this transmission electron microscope allow scientists

NASA receives Mars 
photographs
Mars rover Opportunity re­
cently sent NASA pictures taken 
of Mars’ Victoria crater. The cra­
ter is in the Meridiani Planum 
region. After crawling over the 
Martian terrain for 21 months, 
Opportunity reached the half­
mile-wide, 230-foot-deep cra­
ter.
Scientists hope to determine 
how Victoria’s layers of rocks 
were formed from Opportunity’s 
exploration of the crater. If the 
rock formations indicate water 
was involved in their creation, 
Mars may have been able to sup­
port life at one time.
Opportunity and its twin 
rover Spirit have long outlasted 
their original three-month ex­
peditions. NASA has already ex­
tended their stay on Mars for at 
least one additional year.

PSU scientists find 
‘sensitive’ plant
Scientists at Pennsylvania 
State University discovered that 
the dodder plant, a parasitic 
weed, “sniffs out” its prey. By 
sensing chemicals released by 
its host plants, such as tomatoes, 
alfalfa, and carrots, the dodder 
can locate a plant and attack 
it. The discovery reveals that 
plants can interact by releasing 
and sensing chemicals, an idea 
that was formerly debated in the 
biological community.
Experiments have shown that 
the dodder is very selective in 
choosing a host and responds 
more readily to the chemicals 
released by a tomato plant than 
those released by wheat, a less 
beneficial host. The U.S. Depart­
ment of Agriculture includes the 
dodder on its Top Ten Weeds 
list.

Temperature nears 
million-year high
Scientists say Earth is close 
to having the highest tempera­
tures it has had in the last mil­
lion years. Already within one 
degree Celsius of its highest 
temperatures, the warming of 
the Earth may cause noticeable 
changes in weather patterns. 
One weather phenomenon that 
will be affected is El Niño, which 
will increase in strength as tem­
peratures rise. Global warming 
is the greatest contributor to 
these record temperatures, and 
is the product of greenhouse 
gases.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for 
Space Studies has also noticed 
an increase in average tempera­
tures. Global surface tempera­
tures have increased about 0.2 
degrees Celsius each decade in 
the past 30 years.

Fish are first defense 
for city water
The bluegill, a common type 
of fish, is being used to prevent 
the contamination of water sup­
plies of big cities. Washington, 
D.C., New York, and San Fran­
cisco are among the cities plac­
ing bluegills in tanks that are 
constantly refilled with water 
from the cities’ supplies.
Sensors in the tanks monitor 
the heartbeats, breathing, and 
swimming patterns of the blue­
gills, which change in noxious 
environments. In response to 
toxins in the water, bluegills will 
flex their gills and experience 
the fish version of a cough.

How Things Work: iPods
Albert Lin
The digital music player has 
become a staple of everyday 
life for many college students. 
Apple’s iPod accounts for the 
majority of MP3 players sold 
worldwide.
To better understand the 
iPod, we need to explore mu­
sical recordings themselves. 
Live music, typically heard 
at concerts, is thought of as 
analog, which is a continu­
ous variation of frequencies 
that produces a desired sound. 
Older stereos used analog 
technology.
But in the new world of elec­
tronic gadgets, the iPod is clas­
sified as a digital music player. 
It is called digital because the 
music files stored on the iPod 
are in digital form, meaning 
that the files are mathematical 
samples of the original analog 
wave.
Digital MP3 files are actu­
ally just representations of the 
original sound produced from 
the music’s studio recording. 
MP3s are successful because 
they use an efficient compres­
sion technique to store a lot 
of data into a small amount 
of space. They discard fewer 
audible sounds and can be re­
corded using different bitrates. 
This gives MP3s flexibility in 
size in relation to audio qual­
ity. The iPod allows users to 
take digital music and repro­
duce high-quality sound.
There are seven primary 
components in most iPods: 
the hard drive, battery, touch- 
sensitive click wheel, LCD dis­
play, microprocessor, video 
chip, and audio chip.
The hard drive inside an 
iPod has advanced sensitivity 
technology to allocate almost 
100 gigabits, or roughly 3500 
MP3 songs, per square inch.
The iPod’s iconic click wheel 
is similar to laptop touchpad 
technology. There are five nor­
mal pushbuttons under the 
click wheel that control file 
selection and playback. When 
pressed, the buttons complete 
a corresponding motherboard 
circuit. The circular pad al-
(f

V
lows users to scroll through the 
menus and files on the iPod. 
Under the plastic surface is an 
underlying metallic channel 
membrane that creates a grid 
system. Electrical currents are 
sent through the grid.
When a conducting sur­
face (finger) is near the grid, 
a charged capacitance builds 
up on the grid. Information 
is then sent back to the click 
wheel controller chip, which 
senses changes in capacitance 
on the wheel.
The controller chip is a 
mixed-signal array, meaning 
that it takes analog signals (ca­
pacitance changes) and trans­
lates them into digital signals 
for the microprocessor. It also 
responds to motion speed. 
The faster the motion on the 
wheel, the more compressed 
the stream of signals becomes. 
The wheel stops sending sig­
nals when there is no motion 
detected, thus stopping scroll­
ing on the screen.
The LCD is a thin film tran­
sistor, which gives precise con­
trol over the display elements 
on the screen, allowing rich, 
16-bit color.
The microprocessor and 
chips are relatively small and 
allow for a compact mother­
board layout with hundreds of 
tiny, electronic interconnec­
tions. There is also onboard 
SDRAM, typically around 32
Courtesy of Apple
megabytes. This allows faster 
access to files and better play­
back on the iPod.
Besides hardware, an iPod 
relies on its software. The 
current generation iPod uses 
the Pixo OS 2.1. The software 
helps decode music and video 
files to play back to the user.
No media player is complete 
without its computer juke­
box software. The iPod uses 
iTunes. iTunes uses an auto­
sync feature, which automati­
cally detects whether an iPod 
is connected to the computer.
It also automatically down­
loads any new iTunes content 
to the iPod.
However, the software can 
force the iPod to match the 
iTunes library. iTunes can 
wipe any new MP3s from the 
iPod if they were not trans­
ferred through iTunes when 
autosynching, unless specified 
in iTunes preferences. Simply, 
the iTunes software detects 
an iPod and synchronizes the 
iPod’s library with its own li­
brary.
The iPod’s compact and 
sleek form resulted from years 
of design work to more effec­
tively house its various micro­
technologies. Though many 
other digital players on the 
market employ similar fea­
tures, the iPod remains the 
best-selling digital player to­
day.
Nanotechnology expands at Pitt
PITT, from A6
reactive ion etching system uses 
a beam of charged particles to 
cut away at small samples of 
material.
Scientists will be able to mea­
sure samples of materials at the 
nanoscale, which will help them 
see how the materials behave.
“The facility we are open­
ing today is truly a world-class 
facility,” said the University of 
Pittsburgh’s provost and senior 
vice chancellor, James V. Maher. 
“I’m looking forward to the work 
we can all do in this building in 
the coming decades.”
The co-director of the Peters­
en Institute of NanoScience and 
Engineering, Hong Koo Kim, 
said that the facility will allow 
researchers to perform full- 
scale nanofabrication.
“It is very science-oriented, 
more discovery-oriented,” said 
Kim. “We want to go down to [a] 
fundamental level.”- 
Pitt’s School of Engineering, 
School of Arts and Sciences, and 
School of Health Sciences will
also use the new facility.
Kim told Dynamic Business in 
the summer of 2005, “In every 
discipline, there is a growing 
need for fundamental capa­
bilities to look at and act on the 
molecular level.
“If you talk with people across 
various disciplines, you learn dif­
ferent approaches.”
The new facility affords stu­
dents and faculty a number of 
research opportunities, which 
include the creation of scaffold­
ing that would support damaged 
hearts, the development of fast­
er and smaller computers, and 
the creation of sensors to detect 
chemical levels in the human 
body.
One such project is currently 
headed by Pitt chemistry profes­
sor Sanford Asher. Asher is work­
ing with Gerald Cano, CEO of 
Glucose Sensing Technologies, to 
create contact lenses that change 
color in response to an individu­
al’s glucose levels.
Cano said that creating the 
lenses first requires growing 
nanoscale colloidal particles.
These particles produce a color 
depending on their spacing, 
which depends on glucose levels.
Cano said that once the par­
ticles are grown, they self-assem- 
ble naturally in the sensory mate­
rial.
“The making of this material is 
really pretty simple once you’ve 
developed these colloidal par­
ticles,” Cano said. “It’s really sim- 
plistically elegant in the way it’s 
all done.”
The list of projects goes on, 
ranging from the study of pro­
teins to the use of computer 
models illustrating nanoparticle 
assemblage to research of metal 
and ceramic strength.
Prior to the facility’s unveiling, 
Pitt’s chancellor, Mark A. Norden- 
berg, said that the new facility 
will benefit students advancing 
their education, faculty working 
on research projects, and indi­
viduals seeking health improve­
ments.
“Today, we really do open 
up an entire new chapter,” said 
Nordenberg. “There’s a lot to 
celebrate today.”
The science behind aesthetics
ART, from A6
“A major function of art can 
thus be regarded as a function 
of the brain, namely to seek 
knowledge about the world.”
According to Zeki, there are 
two fundamental laws of visu­
al perception: constancy and 
abstraction. He postulated that 
many famous works of art obey 
these laws.
The law of constancy dictates 
that the brain must focus on only 
certain elements of an image, 
those that remain constant. It 
would be impossible to take into 
account the volatile aspects of 
every image we perceive, like 
lighting, viewing point, and dis­
tance.
Cubism, an art movement 
associated with Pablo Picasso 
and Georges Braque, was in part 
a conscious attempt by its par­
ticipants to ignore such fleeting 
components of perception.
Similarly, the law of abstraction
also enables the brain to learn 
of its environment efficiently. 
An observer has the ability pick 
out abstract concepts from par­
ticular images. This is because 
the human memory is not large 
enough to store all of the particu­
lars; we must instead be able to 
hold onto concepts.
Three-fifths of Michelangelo’s 
sculptures, those left unfinished, 
are excellent examples of the rule 
of abstraction. His sculptures 
are abstract in the sense that the 
brain has the task of completing 
them.
Completed works of abstract 
art necessitate the same func­
tion. Part of the struggle of an 
artist is to translate an abstract 
mental concept into a physical 
object. Once the work is created, 
the viewer interprets what has 
been left in the abstract. Neuroes­
thetics is just one way to consider 
the broad topic of aesthetics.
“Aesthetics is generally regard­
ed as a field of philosophy,” said
Dennis Dake, a professor in the 
art and design department at 
Iowa State University.
In recent years, neurologists 
have argued in favor of a connec­
tion between art and its observer, 
and their results are paralleled in 
the art community.
“Without an audience you 
don’t have anything,” Dake 
said.
Dake compared a painting 
without an audience to a tree 
falling in a forest where no one 
is present: “It has to somehow 
be accepted by the people in the 
field.”
Scientists and philosophers 
alike are still far from forming 
any definitive conclusions on the 
subject of aesthetics. Fortunately, 
the body of material available for 
research only continues to grow.
“Art history is to the artist as 
ornithology is to the birds,” said 
Dake. Birds will continue to fly, 
just as artists will continue to cre­
ate art.

The following is an imagined dialogue 
between Cary H. Sherman, president of 
the Recording Industry Association of 
America (RIAA), and Jared L. Cohon, 
who represents Carnegie Mellon at large 
and the administrations of universities 
across the country.
AT RISE: Cary H. Sherman sits at the head 
of a long table in an underground lair. Tied 
to a chair next to him is a tuxedoed Jared 
Cohon.
SHERMAN: Do you know why I’ve 
brought you here?
COHON: Yes—you want me to be one of 
your henchmen.
SHERMAN: “Henchmen” is such a das­
tardly term, Dr. Cohon. I want us to 
work together. Do you comprehend the 
injustice that transpires on your campus, 
on your watch, every day, Dr. Cohon? 
Thanks to your mighty Internet capabili­
ties, students are listening to their favor­
ite Gnarls Barkley re-mixes and watching 
The Chronicles of Riddick for free! 
COHON: It’s not my job to police the 
Internet, Sherman! I make sure the ro­
bots get built, the books get written, and 
the endowment gets bigger. Recently,
you testified before Congress that you 
want to require university officials to 
periodically report to the government 
on their efforts to curtail Internet pi­
racy. You want Congress to deny funding 
to universities that don’t comply. The 
academic world isn’t going to bend over 
backwards for you, Sherman. Do your 
job yourself!
SHERMAN: I tried! Suing college stu­
dents around the country has made me 
terribly unpopular. I need you, and oth­
ers like you, to do the dirty work for me. 
It wouldn’t be hard. Block illegal file 
sharing on your peer-to-peer networks. 
Then buy bulk subscriptions to Napster 
and give them away to all students so 
they can listen to their precious music. 
COHON: It’s not that simple. How are we 
supposed to distinguish between “desir­
able” and “undesirable” file sharing on 
our peer-to-peer networks? There are 
programs available that claim to be able 
to detect and block illegal file sharing, 
but the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
has called them expensive and ineffec­
tive, made “simply to appease the public 
relations needs of the RIAA.” It would 
probably take the computer wizards at 
Carnegie Mellon a whole 15 minutes to
hack their way around such programs. 
Also, it could impede legitimate applica­
tions and hinder our scholarship. And 
Napster? Don’t make me laugh. The new 
Napster is useless. A giant music library, 
sure, but you can’t put it on a CD or iPod. 
Our students will never stand for that! 
Prospective students won’t want to at­
tend a university that exerts Big-Brother­
like control over their Internet usage. 
SHERMAN: How can you sit by and do 
nothing while artists like Britney Spears 
and Gwen Stefani lose pennies a day to 
illegal file sharing? Pennies a day! 
COHON: We are not doing nothing. Our 
director of information security responds 
promptly to copyright infringement no­
tices, and the university complies with 
subpoenas. We’re doing everything re­
quired by the law, and then some. What 
more do you want from us? Want us to 
walk your dog for you, too?
SHERMAN: One more word out of you 
and I’ll flood this lair with enough deci­
bels of Ashlee Simpson to liquefy your 
brain!
COHON: Do it! You can stop me, 
Sherman, but you can’t stop the music!

Our honorable code
A number of news outlets have re­
ported recent survey results from the 
Center for Academic Integrity (CAI) indi­
cating that MBA candidates cheat more 
than graduate students in other fields. 
But don’t let this red flag distract you 
from the bigger picture.
In 1997, the same researchers showed 
84 percent of undergraduate business 
students said they had cheated at least 
once, as compared to 72 percent of en­
gineering students and 66 percent of 
all students. It’s easy to see those sta­
tistics and berate business students and 
business programs for the frequency of 
ethical violations. But if 66 percent of all 
students are cheating, the problem is not 
confined to students of any one major
— it’s system-wide.
This is not to say that we at Carnegie 
Mellon have a crisis on our hands. Over 
the last 10 years, the number of peo­
ple suspended by the Academic Review 
Board in any given year has been in the 
single digits. The number expelled is 
even smaller. Of course, this does not 
include instances when professors deal 
with students directly or when students 
don’t get caught.
Carnegie Mellon is a rigorous and very
competitive environment, and students 
are sure to find themselves in situations 
in which cheating is the easiest option. 
The university takes a hands-off ap­
proach when it comes to proactively ad­
dressing the issue of academic integrity, 
leaving it up to individual professors. 
How can our community effect a cultural 
shift, and inspire students to take the 
more difficult path?
Make no mistake — it is students who 
have the most to lose from the erosion of 
academic integrity in our community.
When cheating is tolerated, honest 
students’ grades suffer relative to the 
average. When the grading is on a curve, 
as it often is in college, cheating literally 
means stealing points from an honest 
student’s grade and tacking them on to 
that of a dishonest student.
More importantly, academic dishon­
esty erodes the value of our most signifi­
cant — not to mention expensive — in­
vestment: our degree. The reputation of 
a university is the reputation of its stu­
dents. When we write Carnegie Mellon 
on our resume, others judge us based on 
what they know about the university.
While enforcing academic integrity is 
often thought of as a job for administra­
tors, students who are confident and 
unwavering in their honesty have the 
greatest reason and power to elevate the 
standard at Carnegie Mellon.
We have a document entitled the 
Carnegie Mellon Code, which we have 
reproduced in its entirety on this page. 
The code clearly lays out the expecta­
tion that all students at Carnegie Mellon 
“meet the highest standards of personal, 
ethical and moral conduct possible.” 
Written early in the University’s history, 
in the crisp, unequivocal language of its 
day, the Carnegie Mellon Code has flown 
under the radar for years, when it could 
have been put to better use.
Few students know the Carnegie 
Mellon Code by name or content, despite 
the fact that it is printed on the inside 
front cover of The Word. Our student 
body has a historical aversion to top- 
down policy decisions. Only a student 
initiative to popularize this powerful 
document will succeed.
Everyone at Carnegie Mellon — stu­
dents, faculty, TAs, administrators — can 
do more to create an atmosphere where 
ethical conduct is the norm. However, a 
true culture change will only come when 
students lead the way.
Campus responds too 
inconsistently to offense
Franklin Williams
In the spring of 2004, The Tartan 
published its annual April Fools issue, 
which was then titled The Natrat. The 
issue contained material that was un­
acceptable on many levels, including 
content that was racist, sexist, and ho­
mophobic. April 5, the day after its pub­
lication, the campus community rallied 
together to protest the issue and called 
for the expulsion of The Tartan’s entire 
editorial staff (regardless of individual 
staff members’ participation in the 
issue), University Disciplinary Com­
mittee hearings for all those directly 
involved, and for The Tartan to be en­
tirely dissolved as an organization.
The Tartan’s staff apologized pro­
fusely, held community forums, hired 
an ombudsman, asked for the resigna­
tion of its editor-in-chief and managing 
editor — then the two top officers in its 
organization — and spent months reor­
ganizing and restructuring its organi­
zational hierarchy.
The result? A paper that is much bet­
ter, stronger, and harder-working than 
what existed before.
The point of this, though, is not to re­
hash the Natrat incident, but rather to 
question readme and then question the 
collective mind of this community.
Over the last few years, readme has 
gone from an amusing satire magazine 
with a large staff, to a chaotic pam­
phlet whose humor was hit-or-miss, to 
a weekly stack of papers containing at 
least one article that insults part of our 
campus.
Gays in Greek life, our university 
president, women, Latin Americans, 
Christians, the elderly, nerds, Jews
— readme has poked fun at everyone I 
can possibly think of. What readme has 
long forgotten is that there is a fine line 
between poking fun and insulting.
Two weeks ago, readme jumped way 
over the line. It contained an article 
entitled “Carnegie Mellon Builds New 
Hauschwitz Dormitory,” a reference to 
the Holocaust prison camp, Auschwitz. 
The article’s final paragraph essentially 
acknowledged that it was a joke, but the 
acknowledgement does not make up for 
the insults that came before it.
If someone you barely knew walked 
up to you and started spewing racial 
epithets, then finished by saying “Nah, 
it’s cool man. I love you — sorry. Didn’t 
mean to offend,” and walked away, it 
wouldn’t make up for the harm that had 
been done.
If anything, tacking on “Just kidding.
It never happened.” to the end of the ar­
ticle should offend more than the article 
itself. Does readme really think that will 
placate the campus and instantly make 
up for what it published? And, more 
importantly, that acknowledgement 
proves that the editors knew the article 
would offend.
The fraternity “Sigma Heil,” the 
world’s largest kitchens and showers on 
campus, scratches on the shower walls, 
and, above all else, the statement of 
“contributing to the betterment of hu­
manity” are just some of the things that 
this article boasts.
What made this article so offensive 
is that it intentionally picked out some 
of the most offensive parts of the Ho­
locaust — things that people still have 
nightmares about — and joked about it 
with an attitude that if we are offended 
it is no one’s fault but our own.
What’s more upsetting, though, is 
the lack of response from the campus 
community. The Natrat incident had 
the entirety of campus up in arms and, 
as stated above, calling for the expul­
sion of the paper’s entire editorial staff. 
readme’s publication has seen none of 
that. The issue was recalled and that 
was the end of it. Local media (the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and the local 
NBC affiliate, WPXI) are the only ones 
who’ve grasped the magnitude and sig­
nificance of readme’s actions.
Maybe the reason for the lack of re­
sponse on campus is that the article was 
recalled before anyone had the chance 
to read it. Maybe we expect to see stu­
pid things come from readme and ex­
pect to be insulted by it day in and day 
out. Maybe we’re just a little bit jaded to 
diversity issues on campus. “Diversity” 
did become the quintessential buzz­
word of the 2005 student government 
elections.
We need to remember that this isn’t 
going to go away. Just as the 2004 
Natrat stepped far over the line of ac- 
ceptibility, readme needs to realize that 
what it has done and what it currently 
does is not acceptable. Satire should not 
be cruel.
We need to remember that these 
issues will not go away until we make 
them go away. We need to deal with 
them instead of shrugging them off be­
cause they don’t directly offend us. This 
is our community, and this kind of reck­
less behavior goes against everything 
we’ve worked so hard to achieve.

Students at Carnegie Mellon, because 
they are members of an academic com­
munity dedicated to the achievement 
of excellence, are expected to meet the 
highest standards of personal, ethical, 
and moral conduct possible.
These standards require personal in­
tegrity, a commitment to honesty with­
out compromise, as well as truth with­
out equivocation and a willingness to 
place the good of the community above 
the good of the self. Obligations once 
undertaken must be met, commitments 
kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, individuals are expected 
to uphold the standards of the commu­
nity in addition to holding others ac­
countable for said standards. It is rare 
that the life of a student in an academic 
community can be so private that it will 
not affect the community as a whole or 
that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement, and 
communication of knowledge are not 
possible without a commitment to these 
standards. Creativity cannot exist with­
out acknowledgment of the creativity of 
others. New knowledge cannot be de­
veloped without credit for prior knowl­
edge. Without the ability to trust that 
these principles will be observed, an 
academic community cannot exist.
The commitment of its faculty, staff, 
and students to these standards con­
tributes to the high respect in which 
the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. 
Students must not destroy that respect 
by their failure to meet these standards. 
Students who cannot meet them should 
voluntarily withdraw from the Univer­
sity.
It is the responsibility of each mem­
ber of the Carnegie Mellon community 
to be familiar with University policies 
and guidelines.

New program 
to aid student 
organizations
|jm —
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
We spoke to you last week about 
the way we get things done. We’re 
an inclusive, ideas-driven admin­
istration. Do you have ideas for 
improving the campus commu­
nity? Contact us. We want to be 
the enablers of your goals for our 
university. To illustrate this, we’ve 
invited sophomore Nelson Cheung 
to write this week’s column:
September has come and gone. 
Ask any Carnegie Mellon stu­
dent how he or she is doing, and 
'you will get a response such as 
“busy” or “sleep-deprived.” Try­
ing to squeeze everything into 
our schedule — student organi­
zations, sports teams, the arts
— makes it that much harder to 
find time to relax.
Karl Sjogren had this in mind 
when he approached me about 
addressing efficiency in student 
organizations on campus. Af­
ter meeting with Karl, Kaycee 
Palko from Student Activities, 
and other student leaders, we 
created what is now the Making 
Your Mark Leadership Series.
The series is for all students 
who wish to free up time in their . 
busy schedules. Every three 
weeks or so, we will hold work­
shops to optimize your organi­
zation. These workshops will 
disseminate information to help 
students manage extracurricu­
lar activities. This fail, we’ll be 
offering sessions that include 
day-to-day efficiency, program 
planning, team dynamics, and 
sustaining your organization.
From these 90-minute ses­
sions, students will take away 
concrete skills that they can im­
mediately apply to their activities 
and organizations. For example, 
each student will be given a 
packet of helpful hints in student 
leadership. These one- or two- 
sentence reminders are meant 
to be easy-action items, helping 
them streamline their organiza­
tions one step at a time.
The format of the series will 
be a dinner while student leaders 
educate participants on a par­
ticular skill set. After the brief 
presentation, participants will 
have the opportunity to both ask 
questions and network with the 
other student leaders. Everyone 
will leave each session a more ef­
ficient leader.
Please join us for our first ses­
sion this Wednesday: “Day to 
Day Efficiency: Streamlining
Your Organization,” at 5:30 p.m. 
in the Wright Room in the Uni­
versity Center. See you there!
Nelson Cheung is an RA in Mudge 
House, a special advisor to PLACE 
House, and an active member of 
SDC. His interest in leadership 
and self-development led Karl and 
Andrea to solicit his help for their 
student leader initiatives for this 
year. They are deeply appreciative 
for all the work he’s put in so far.

Shoddy editorial process made readme 
debacle inevitable
The Carnegie Mellon com­
munity can easily recognize 
that readme’s recent publication 
was unacceptable. What people 
might not realize was that the 
problem was long in the mak­
ing. Two years ago, while I was 
executive officer of The Tartan 
(a position now called pub­
lisher) I worked to rehuild it af­
ter a similar incident. That year, 
many people strove to build in 
new layers of accountability and 
oversight and professionalized 
the incredible copy and layout 
teams that bring you The Tartan 
every week. During this time 
period, readme faltered. No lon­
ger the clever newsletter I re­
membered from my first years, 
the quality decreased and soon 
readme began to miss issues.
I realized that readme’s prob­
lems resembled those of the 
old Tartan: poor staffing, inad­
equate training, and unclear
oversight. So I offered to help. 
For no charge, The Tartan would 
have copy edited and laid out. 
every readme issue while leav­
ing readme complete control 
over content. The only change I 
requested was that The Tartan’s 
publisher be able to stop an is­
sue if he/she was concerned it 
was too offensive, in order to sit 
down with the readme editorial 
staff and discuss it.
Reflecting the irreverence of 
its articles, readme thought it 
didn’t need to take its problems 
seriously. This offensive issue 
did not reflect a single lapse of 
judgment; this was a carefully 
planned course of action and 
a refusal to treat the Carnegie 
Mellon community with the re­
spect it deserves.

Peace and stability are the ultimate goals in Iraq
If ideological opponents can swallow partisanship and work together, decisive victory is possible
Patrick Pettibon
An article in the September 
22 New York Times pointed out a 
concrete example of the tremen­
dous personnel strains in the 
armed forces: National guards­
men who traditionally spend five 
years at home between foreign 
deployments are now getting an 
average of only three years be­
fore redeployment.
Personnel problems within the 
armed forces indicate that the 
military is overextended. This 
presents President Bush with 
a predicament. It has become 
more difficult for the military to 
achieve victory in either Afghan­
istan or Iraq, and if the military 
remains undermanned and un­
derequipped, the end of the war 
will grow harder still to reach.
The lack of enlistment is also 
a difficult political problem for 
Bush’s opponents. According to 
a poll released on September 24 
by the Opinion Research Corpo­
ration, 59 percent of Americans 
now oppose the war. Without the 
support of the American people, 
how can enlistment increase? On 
the other hand, how can Bush’s 
opponents support the military 
and the war effort while still op­
posing the President?
If all of the opposing sides stick 
to their ideologies, then ending 
the war becomes a confusing 
paradox. If the President cannot 
make ending the war a top prior­
ity, then the military will never 
achieve victory. Alternatively, 
the American public’s powerful 
opposition to the war has left the 
military too weak to provide ba­
sic security in Iraq because there 
are too few troops to restore sta­
bility there.
Ideological opposition pre­
vents all of us from achieving 
what we want. President Bush 
needs to come to terms with and 
effectively articulate his desire 
to end the war if he wants a vic­
tory. The American people must 
commit to the war effort if they 
want to bring about a resolution 
to the conflict.
An American victory is es­
sential to both sides. Without 
it, we will face new obstacles in 
providing humanitarian aid in 
the future, for we cannot aid the 
people of countries where vio­
lence is the rule without giving 
more power to their oppressive 
governments — unless we want 
to engage in more full-scale in­
vasions. With the military cred­
ibility of a decisive victory, well- 
placed and well-enforced threats 
can send strong messages to 
other violent leaders.
But We also wish to prevent 
American hegemony, or global 
cultural and moral dominance.
However, if our goal is to prevent 
situations like the one we’ve en­
tered in Iraq, we must recognize 
our failures and take respon­
sibility to repair the damages 
we’ve caused by allowing the 
war to ensue. Now that we find 
ourselves at war, the only way 
for the Iraqi people and culture 
to flourish is to return peace and 
stability to the country.
If we want to see any prag­
matic results from upholding our 
ideals, we must achieve a victory 
in Iraq. It’s time to swallow our 
differences and admit that we all 
share the common goal of end­
ing the war and stabilizing the 
region.
A major obstacle in the war 
in Iraq is the administration’s 
reluctance to set plausible mili­
tary goals. There are no precon­
ditions for victory. As far as we 
know, the war will be over when 
victory is achieved, but we have 
no idea when that will happen 
and what it will entail. There 
have been a few milestones: 
Unseating Saddam Hussein and 
decimating his army are obvi­
ous markers of victory. But now 
we seem to be losing resolve. 
We need an overwhelming oc­
cupying force. While Hussein 
and the old Iraqi army have been 
removed, young men have been 
flooding across the borders for 
their chance to fight American 
hegemony. The military must 
make it its top priority to begin 
maintaining stability by secur­
ing the borders and deploying a 
tremendous presence.
Jennifer Kennedy/Art Staff
Occupation and then with­
drawal are the final steps here. 
But once the administration rec­
ognizes that the goal is to end 
the war, the American people 
must be willing to commit to the 
effort. We must set our ideolo­
gies aside for a moment and take 
responsibility for our failures or 
our bad decisions.
If the decision-makers in 
Congress and the White House 
can recognize military goals as 
preconditions for victory, and 
the American people can get be­
hind the armed forces, then we 
can end the war and bring peace 
and stability back to Iraq.

Women’s soccer records a win and a loss
by Sam Kim
Junior Staffwriter
Last week, the Carnegie Mel­
lon women’s soccer team started 
off on the right foot as they de­
feated Allegheny College on 
Tuesday in double overtime 2-1. 
On Saturday, the Tartans lost a 
hard-fought battle against the 
University of Chicago 1-0.
At Allegheny, the two teams 
played to a scoreless first half. In 
the 52nd minute of play, Sarah 
Beth Berner’s goal gave'Allegh­
eny the lead. However, Carnegie 
Mellon junior forward Kasey 
Stever headed a pass from junior 
defender Amanda Rose to tie the 
game with about 10 minutes of 
play left. The goal was Stever’s 
third of the season.
“Kasey’s goal to tie the game 
was really big,” Rose said. “Our 
team has had a hard time finish­
ing the ball, so when she put it 
in, it was a great boost of confi­
dence.”
In the first overtime, Stever 
took advantage of, a beautiful 
cross from Rose, but the ball hif
the crossbar. “I slid and tried to 
do a mid-air volley-type deal, but 
clearly it hit the crossbar. It was 
sweet though, because that play 
really got everyone pumped both 
on and off the field,” Stever said.
The re-energized Tartans 
finally scored in the second 
overtime on a goal by sopho­
more forward Amanda Coffin.
* Coffin’s shot in the 103rd minute 
gave the women’s team a well- 
deserved win. The Tartans out- 
shot Allegheny 17-3.
After the game-ending buzzer, 
the Tartans ran out on the field 
in celebration. This was an espe­
cially meaningful victory for the 
Tartans because they had tied 
Allegheny the past two years. 
The women’s team improved to 
4-3-1 after Tuesday’s victory.
“Our speed of play picked up 
in overtime, and we really out­
played our opponents. I am very 
proud of the whole team for how 
we worked together to win a 
tough game in tough field condi­
tions,” Coffin said.
“It was a real hard-fought 
game. We needed to win this 
game,” head coach Sue Willard
said. “Persistence paid.”
However, the Tartans could 
not build on their emotional 
comeback win as they fell short 
against the University of Chi­
cago in the Tartans’ first Univer­
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
matchup on Saturday. Last year, 
the Tartans upset the eighth- 
ranked University of Chicago.
Chicago scored within the 
first 10 minutes of the game on 
a goal by Sigrid Nachtergaele. 
The Tartans were held to only 
three shots, while Chicago had 
six. Stever had two shots on goal. 
Sophomore goalie Christie Ad­
ams had two saves.
After Saturday’s loss, the 
women’s soccer team fell to 
4-4-1 overall and 0-1-0 in the 
UAA. The University of Chicago 
Maroons improved their overall 
record to 7-1-1 and 1--0-0 in the 
conference.
The women’s soccer team will 
return home to play Grove City 
College at 7:30 p.m. on Wednes­
day. On Sunday, they will resume 
UAA conference play with an 11 
a.m. home game against Wash­
ington University of St. Louis.
Golf team finishes fifth in season opener
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon golf team 
opened its fall season September 
24 at the Griffin Motors Invita­
tional, with the second round of 
golf ending the next day. The in­
vitational was held by Allegheny 
College. The men finished the in­
vitational in fifth place out of six 
teams with a team score of 614. 
The Allegheny Gators came out 
on top with a score of 586.
Windy and wet conditions 
marked the first round. The Tar­
tans were led by junior Howard 
Smith, who shot a 75. Sopho­
more Joshua Chen followed 
closely, carding a 77. Sophomore 
Alex Timmons and first-year 
Christopher Lee both turned in 
scores of 79. Junior Blake Darby 
finished up Tartan scoring with 
80 strokes.
The Tartan team score of 310 
strokes put them into fourth 
place going into the second day 
of the invitational. The Tartans 
led the Allegheny Blue Team by 
two strokes and Westminster 
College by 11 strokes.
On the second day, the Tartans
teed off at 9 a.m. to drier and 
milder conditions. Better condi­
tions translated into better scores 
as the team shot a combined 304, 
six strokes better than the previ­
ous day.
Most notably, Darby carded a 
73, which was one over par and 
seven strokes better than his 
first-day performance. Darby fin­
ished the tournament in second 
place for the Tartans and 10th 
place overall, tied with Steve 
Killa from Saint Vincent College.

The Terrell Owens saga
Doug Fricker
Did you hear the news? 
Terrell Owens “accidentally 
overdosed” on painkillers! 
Owens — the controversial 
wide receiver for the Dallas 
Cowboys — is considered 
one of most talented players 
in the game of football; 
unfortunately, he’s also known 
for his infamous antics on and 
off the field.
Last Tuesday, Owens’ 
publicist Kim Etheredge found 
him in his home lethargic 
and non-responsive with his 
prescription pain medication 
empty and called 911. When 
Owens was asked by rescue 
personnel if he had taken the 
rest of his prescription (he’d 
only taken five out of the 40 
pills prior to Tuesday), he 
responded with, “yes.” When 
he was asked if he was trying 
to harm himself, he again 
responded with “yes.” Owens 
was then taken to Baylor 
University Medical Center.
Owens was prescribed the 
pain medication for an injury 
to his right finger, which he 
broke on September 17 in 
Dallas’ win over Washington. 
Owens had a plate screwed 
into the bone attached to his 
.right ring finger. His recovery 
time was estimated at two to 
four weeks.
Owens was taking a generic 
form of Vicodin, a type of 
pain medication, along with 
his supplements. Apparently 
Owens didn’t eat very much 
on Tuesday, because the next 
thing he knew he was in the 
hospital.
On Wednesday Owens left 
the hospital late in the morning 
and, that afternoon, denied the 
police report and media frenzy 
that claimed he had “attempted 
suicide.” Owens said that he 
was not and is not depressed 
and that he had an allergic 
reaction to the combination of 
pain medication prescribed for 
his hand injury and his usual 
supplements.
Owens showed no signs 
of distress during his news 
conference when he gave an in- 
depth and believable refute to 
what the media had written and 
said about the situation. “There 
was no suicide attempt.... I 
took a couple pain pills and 
then I had some treatment.... 
I was groggy a little bit.... I 
took some extra pills with my 
supplements.”
He went on to say that the 
rumor that he took 35 pills was 
absurd, and that he wouldn’t 
be here today if he’d taken that 
many pills. He attributed his 
“yes” responses to the rescue 
personnel to the fact that he 
was groggy and completely out 
of it.
On Thursday, Dallas police 
closed their investigation, 
deeming it an “accidental 
overdose.” Owens was 
practicing on the field hours 
after leaving the hospital on 
Wednesday, and not only 
played, but started Sunday 
against the Tennessee Titans.
His image and background 
transformed this week’s series 
of events into a media circus, 
one that wouldn’t have been 
blown out of proportion if this 
had happened to any other NFL
player. It is unfortunate this 
story had to be treated the way 
it was just because it involved 
Owens.
Despite his talent, Owens 
has been a bane to many of 
his former teams. He gained 
notoriety for ripping on 
teammates and coaches .and 
refusing to report in 2004 to 
his new team, the Baltimore 
Ravens, after he was traded to 
them. In the past, his attitude 
has gotten in the way of his 
team’s performance. It was 
so bad that last year in early 
November the Philadelphia 
Eagles suspended him and then 
announced that he wouldn’t 
play the rest of the season. .
In this latest incident, the 
media is at fault for assuming 
the worst, a suicide attempt, 
and broadcasting it out to the 
world before getting all the 
facts straight.
Interestingly, this story won’t 
hurt Owens’ image — in fact, it 
might improve it. It shows the 
world that he’s human, and the 
fact that he still played Sunday 
shows that he’s a warrior as 
well.
I’m not going to put Owens 
on a pedestal and tell you that 
he’s the greatest man alive and 
that we all should worship the 
very ground he walks on, but 
this goes to show everyone 
that Owens is human and that 
there’s a lot going through that 
mind of his. He’s potentially 
the best wide receiver in the 
National Football League. He’s 
definitely the most publicized. 
Now, if only he could let his on- 
the-field . performance speak 
for itself.

THE TARTAN • OCTOBER 2, 2006
Football caps first half of season with perfect record
FOOTBALL, from A14 field for a quick strike to junior field, and their offense off the sophomore quarterback Doug
tight end Nolan Sweet to cut the field, it’s to our benefit as a team. Facemyer to first-year running
punt the offense took possession 
at their opponent’s 48-yard line. 
Over the next 12 snaps the Tar­
tans ran the ball on each play, 
pounding out short yet produc­
tive gains that yielded consistent 
first downs. Gimson’s second 
touchdown of the evening, a 
four-yard dive through the heart 
of the Tigers’ defense, closed out 
the drive and gave the Tartans a 
21-point edge.
Faced with a large deficit, the 
Tigers, who had averaged 38 
points and 269 passing yards 
per game during their 2-1 start, 
looked to the air for points. Neal 
led Colorado College down the
field for a quick strike to junior 
tight end Nolan Sweet to cut the 
Tartan lead in half to 28-14.
Carnegie Mellon countered 
the Tigers’ aerial offensive with 
another ground-based attack 
that re-established their three- 
touchdown lead. With the fourth 
quarter clock ticking to under 13 
minutes, Gimson — who gained 
119 yards — charged into the 
end zone for his third score to 
push the lead to 35-14 and ef­
fectively put the game out of the 
Tigers’ reach.
“Up front, they were just block­
ing great,” said Sivek, who led 
the Tartan backfield with 29 car­
ries and 186 yards. “Whenever 
we can keep their defense on the
field, and their offense off the 
field, it’s to our benefit as a team. 
We love doing that.”
Moments after Gimson’s 
dive, however, lightning forced 
a pause in the action as both 
teams headed inside to avoid the 
weather.
The 20-minute break did not 
seem to not affect the Tartan de­
fense. Two plays after the delay, 
Bodnar snagged a deflected pass 
and returned it to the Colorado 
College 28 yard line. Sivek and 
the Tartans’ offense only needed 
two snaps to cover the remain­
ing 28 yards and post their sixth 
score on the day.
The Tigers and Tartans (via a 
13-yard touchdown pass from
sophomore quarterback Doug 
Facemyer to first-year running 
back Greg Pitts) traded touch­
downs on each team’s next of­
fensive series. Colorado College 
grabbed another late score on 
a 10-yard run by Neal, but once 
the clock finally hit triple ze­
ros, Carnegie Mellon prevailed 
50-26. The 5-0 start gives the 
Tartans their first perfect first 
half of the season since 1990, the 
last time they went undefeated.
Carnegie Mellon receives a 
week off next Saturday due to 
a bye in their schedule. But the 
Tartans return to the field Satur­
day, October 14, to tangle with 
Case Western Reserve University 
in Cleveland.

terms of the wind and tempera­
ture on day two,” head coach 
Rich Erdelyi said. “Darby putted 
better on day two and actually 
could have been under par ex­
cept for an out of bounds.”
Smith again led the Tartans, 
turning in a 77 on the second day 
for 152 total points. He finished 
the invitational in eighth place 
overall, tied with John Bougher 
of the Allegheny Blue Team.
Timmons recorded a 76, three 
strokes better than his first 
round. He finished third for the 
team and 17th overall tied with 
Christian Goetz of Allegheny. 
Chen and Lee finished tied for 
22nd place overall with a two- 
day total of 157.
The Tartans were unable to 
hold off Allegheny’s Blue Team, 
which finished two strokes 
ahead of the Tartans — dropping 
the Tartans to fifth place overall. 
Competition was close, though
— only 13 strokes separated 
second-place Indiana University 
of Pennsylvania (601) from the 
fifth-place Tartans (614). “The 
competition was good, and we 
were very competitive with all 
the teams,” Erdelyi said.
While the Carnegie Mellon 
golf team’s primary season is in 
the spring, fall tournaments are 
important for them. “The spring 
season is most important. Doing 
well in the fall, however, helps 
your regional and national rank­
ings,” Erdelyi said. “We had a 
great season last year and just 
missed nationals. We did gain a 
lot of respect which will hope­
fully carry over this year.”
The Tartans are back in action 
today at the Westminster Invita­
tional. The team is looking for 
a win this week. “We won the 
Westminster Invitational last 
fall and feel we can do it again,” 
Erdelyi said. “There will be three 
Division II schools there, so the 
competition will be good.”

Browne, and Griffin netted 
his second goal of the game in 
similar fashion off a cross from 
first-year midfielder Jonathan 
Simon in the 84th minute.
Sophomore midfielder Daniel 
Brackley had scored the first goal 
of the game in the 15th minute 
when he took a pass from Park 
and made a shot that deflected 
off a Marietta defender and into 
the left side of the net. The Tar­
tan lead did not stand very long, 
however, as the Pioneers an­
swered four minutes later with 
Kyle Muth’s team-leading fifth 
goal of the season. Muth’s shot 
found an opening in the upper 
left corner of the net, out of Ba­
zin’s reach. The Tartans outshot 
the Pioneers 12-3 with Bazin 
collecting one save in the win.
“The game against Marietta 
was a must-win,” said Park. “We 
just had to go in and do the job. 
Fortunately, we were able to get 
the job done and get ready for 
Chicago in the process.”

2, October 2006THE TARTANA14
Men’s soccer 
team shuts 
out Chicago
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Tartan men’s soccer team 
opened University Athletic Asso­
ciation (UAA) play on Saturday, 
coming up with a huge victory 
by defeating the University of 
Chicago Maroons 1-0. The win, 
coupled with their 4-1 victory 
Tuesday over Marietta College, 
leaves them at 7-2 (1-0 in the 
UAA) on the season.
The Tartans, coming off a 
1-0 home loss to the Maroons 
last season, needed to beat 
Chicago to keep their champi­
onship hopes alive in a highly 
competitive conference. After a 
scoreless first half in which the 
Tartans held a 5-3 shot advan­
tage, Carnegie Mellon scored 
one of their biggest goals of the 
season.
Senior forward Jonathan 
Browne scored his second goal 
of the year and what proved 
to be the game’s only goal in 
the 53rd minute. The Tartan 
defense and sophomore goal­
keeper Matthew Bazin stood up 
to the numerous offensive at­
tacks mounted by the Maroons 
to preserve the one-goal lead 
in which Bazin collected four 
saves.
“Beating the University of 
Chicago gives us some momen­
tum heading into the rest of 
UAA play,” said senior forward 
Andrew Park. “We came out 
pretty strong Saturday, and 
after we scored early in the sec­
ond half, we just needed to hold 
on. After Browne’s goal, Chi­
cago started coming at us pretty 
hard the last 20 or 30 minutes 
of the game, and our defense 
stood up to the challenge. For 
the seniors, we’d lost to Chicago 
our freshman year, tied them 
sophomore year, and lost last 
year, so this was the first time 
we’d beaten them during our 
time here.”
Earlier in the week, the Tar­
tans snapped their two-game 
losing streak by defeating the 
Marietta College Pioneers 4-1 
on the road. After each team 
scored a goal in the first half, 
first-year midfielder Ricky Grif­
fin scored what proved to be the 
game-winner in the 59th min­
ute when he unleashed a shot 
from inside the 18-yard box that 
found its way between Marietta 
goalkeeper Brian Bugge and the 
right post.
Carnegie Mellon was able to 
add two late goals by first-year 
midfielder Patrick Lutz and 
Griffin, respectively, to put the 
game out of reach. Lutz scored 
in the 79th minute off a cross 
from first-year midfielder Ryan

Only the weather could slow 
down the Tartans Saturday 
night.
Playing under both the lights 
and rain (which forced a brief 
game delay due to lightning) 
for their week five matchup 
with Colorado College, Carn­
egie Mellon employed a patient 
and consistent offensive attack 
that carried the Tartans to a fifth 
straight victory.
“Our running game was very 
efficient tonight,” Tartans head 
coach Rich Lackner said about 
a ground attack that racked up 
383 yards on 60 carries. “By run­
ning the football, you take more 
time off the clock against a team 
like this that is so aggressive of­
fensively. [Offensive coordinator 
Rich Erdelyi] and the staff, they 
saw what was working, so why 
change it? And it worked well 
and we came out with a W.”
The offensive outpouring be­
gan from the opening whistle. 
After showcasing a much-im- 
proved passing attack in recent 
weeks, the Tartans returned to 
their trademark running game 
early against the Tigers. A seven- 
yard completion from senior 
quarterback Kevin Mulkern 
to sophomore tight end Derek 
Wisnieski on the first play from 
scrimmage was followed by eight 
consecutive rushes. The final
carry on the 11-play, 69-yard 
drive came courtesy of junior 
running back Travis Sivek, who 
barreled into the end zone for a 
one-yard touchdown.
Colorado College answered 
the score with a lengthy touch­
down drive of its own. Senior 
quarterback Chris Neal’s 12-yard 
strike to junior wide receiver Max 
Green evened the score.
The Tigers threatened to take 
the lead when, after forcing a 
Tartan punt, they drove down to 
Carnegie Mellon’s 26-yard line. 
But senior defensive back Aaron 
Lewis quickly ended Colorado 
College’s hopes of taking the lead 
by stepping in front of a Neal 
pass and returning his. second 
interception of the season to the
Carnegie Mellon 33.
As they have done all season, 
the Tartans capitalized on their 
opponent’s mistakes, converting 
turnovers into points. Another 
lengthy, methodical drive en­
sued, and when senior running 
back Robert Gimson plunged 
into the end zone for another 
one-yard score, the Tartans re­
took the lead, 14-7.
Again, Colorado College 
mounted an impressive string of 
plays in response to the deficit, 
driving to the 20-yard line. But 
the Tartans’ defense buckled 
down and forced the Tigers to at­
tempt a 32-yard field goal, which 
was wide right.
“Their offense was the best of­
fense we’ve faced by far,” said ju­
nior linebacker Jonathan Bodnar. 
“I think everybody just picked it 
up when we needed to.”
The offense then marched 80 
yards on 12 plays on a drive that 
not only ended with a Mulkern 
two-yard touchdown run, but 
took nearly five minutes off the 
clock. The drive left only 37 sec­
onds on the clock for the Tigers, 
who headed to the locker room 
trailing 21-7 at halftime 
Once the third quarter began, 
the rainfall — which had been 
light throughout the first half
— increased in intensity.
So too did the Tartans.

and-out and following a Tigers

Women’s volleyball sees first UAA play

Junior Staffwriter
Over the weekend, the wom­
en’s volleyball team traveled to 
Emory University in Atlanta to 
participate in the first round of 
the University Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA) Round Robin. The 
team faced Emory, the Univer­
sity of Rochester, and Brandeis 
University. Suffering their only 
loss to Emory, the Tartans ended 
their weekend 2-1, bringing 
their season record to 9-9.
In Carnegie Mellon’s first 
match Friday afternoon, Emory 
defeated the Tartans 3-1. Dur­
ing the first set, the team came 
out playing hard to win 30-27, 
but then dropped three straight 
to lose the game.
“It was a really tough game,” 
head coach Kim Kelly said. “Our 
defense played really, really well 
and kept us in the game. Offen-

The Tartans have gotten off to 
an impressive start this football 
season, with a current record 
of 5-0. Leading the Tartan de­
fense is senior Aaron Lewis. Last 
t season, Lewis led the team with 
• ¦ 115 tackles, and was honored
with All-America status. This 
season, Lewis is once again lead­
ing the team in tackles. He was 
also named University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Athlete of the 
Week, following a game against 
Westminister College, in which 
he had a 20-yard touchdown 
interception return. The Tartan 
sat down with Lewis to discuss 
his accomplishments on and off 
the field.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing football? How did you 
get into the sport?
Lewis: My dad is a high school 
coach, and I started playing in 
fourth grade, which was actu­
ally late because pee wee starts 
in first grade, but my dad did 
not want me getting burnt out.
T: Did you always want to 
play football in college?
L: I did wrestling and base­
ball in high school, but really I 
knew football was always what 
I wanted to do. It was definitely 
a goal, something I had hoped 
for, and around my junior year 
I started getting recruited and 
knew I would play.
If: How supportive has your 
far,nly been?
sively if we could have just con­
nected on a few more plays, the 
outcome could have been en­
tirely different.”
The defense was lead by senior 
libero Kat Fox and senior outside 
hitter Amanda Bradford, who 
had 29 and 21 digs, respectively.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
recorded wins over both Roches­
ter and Brandeis. In their match 
against Rochester, the Tartans 
fell behind after losing the first 
two sets 30-28. The Tartans ral­
lied to win the next three sets.
The Tartans relied heavily on 
their bench to win the game. “I 
really have to give this game to 
the bench,” said Kelly. “Everyone 
took it in stride, and they all re­
ally clicked and played well to 
pull out a win.”
Senior middle hitter Malena 
Yablinsky led the team with 18 
kills, while Bradford played an­
other great match, recording 24 
digs and 14 kills. Senior setter
L: They’ve always supported 
me. My parents have not missed 
a game since my freshman year. 
They always make the drive to 
watch me play.
T: What do you try to focus on 
during a game?
L: Defensively, we work a lot 
on trying to predict offenses and 
learn their tendencies, so during 
the game I really work on just 
picking up their subtleties and 
reacting to the game. Football is 
really a team sport, so I am mak­
ing sure I am doing my part.
T: You have done extremely 
well at Carnegie Mellon both 
academically and in football. 
How do you manage to succeed 
at both?
L: Really it has become such 
a structured lifestyle. I get up, 
go to class, go to practice, come 
home, and get my work done. 
Academics have always been 
important to me, obviously be­
cause I am at Carnegie Mellon, 
so I have just always been fo­
cused on doing well.
T: Which of your accomplish­
ments are you most proud of?
L: Definitely being selected as 
both an. Academic and Football
Brea Carlock aided the win with 
48 assists.
Later in the day, the Tartans 
overtook Brandeis 3-0. Once 
again, the Tartan defense domi­
nated the game, with Bradford 
and Fox having 14 and nine digs 
apiece. Carlock and first-year 
setter Samantha Carter contrib­
uted with a combined total of 38 
assists.
Offensively, senior right set­
ter Catie Fisher and Bradford led 
the Tartans with 12 and 11 kills, 
respectively. “We played really 
well, we really dominated the 
entire game, and we stayed in­
tense,” said Kelly. “This is UAA 
play; we always have to play in­
tense, and the team did a good 
job of that today.”
This weekend the Tartans will 
host the Carnegie Mellon Invi­
tational. Hiram College, Penn 
State-Altoona, and Wooster Col­
lege are among the attending 
teams.

really proud of.
T: Is there anything in par­
ticular from this season that you 
think has helped you and the 
team succeed?
L: The one thing we have done 
really well this year is looking 
back at tapes and games. There 
is not really much that we would 
have done differently. No plays 
that we really regretted; both 
the offense and defense have 
played well; we have not disap­
pointed ourselves.
T: Do you have a favorite 
player in the NFL?
L: I cannot say that I have one 
favorite. I am a defensive guy, so 
I do like Troy Polamalu and Ed 
Reed. Watching them play, I am 
just amazed by some of the stuff 
they can do.
T: Okay, as someone who un­
derstands the game and what 
makes a team good, can we get 
a Super Bowl XLI pick?
L: Well I am a Browns fan, 
and I know Pittsburghers will 
not like it, but I am ^oing to 
have to go with the Beilgals.
Men’s and women’s tennis 
defeats their competition
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Senior tennis player Mona Iyer 
described it best when she said, 
“The fall season is just a tease 
for the spring.” While it may be a 
short tease of a season, Carnegie 
Mellon’s tennis teams certainly 
have a lot to be excited about
— both the men’s and women’s 
team crushed their competition 
last week.
The women competed at the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa­
tion (ITA) Southeast Regional 
Women’s Tennis Tournament 
which was held at the University 
of Mary Washington in Freder­
icksburg, Va. The tournament 
opened on Saturday, September
23, with the final round ending 
on Monday.
Three Tartan singles players
— the most in the program’s his­
tory — and two doubles teams 
advanced to the quarterfinals 
on Sunday. Senior Amy Staloch, 
who won last year’s ITA national 
championship, defended her 
title and won the singles cham­
pionship on Monday.
In the quarterfinals Sunday, 
Staloch defeated Katie Bouret 
of Washington & Lee University 
6-0, 6-1 in a morning match-up. 
She then returned to the court to 
beat Anita Bhamidipati of Johns 
Hopkins University 6-1, 6-0.
Iyer beat Amy Sheetz of Mary 
Washington 6-0, 6-3 before 
falling to Sonya Reynolds of 
Swarthmore College 6-3, 6-2. 
First-year Alisa Liebowitz was 
also stopped in the quarterfinals 
when she fell to Katie Tabb of 
Washington & Lee 6-2, 6-0.
Iyer and Staloch paired up 
to beat Brittany Matava and 
Amanda Schubert of Johns Hop­
kins 8-5 and Lauren Claire and 
Weston of Washington & Lee 
by the same score to move onto 
the doubles finals. Liebowitz 
and first-year Andrea Meytha- 
ler also saw doubles action in 
the quarterfinals, falling to the 
Washington & Lee pair of Tabb 
and Ginny Wortham 8-3.
On Monday, Staloch and Iyer 
teamed up in the doubles cham­
pionship match, but were unable 
to put together a victory, falling 
to Sonya Reynolds and Sara Sar­
gent of Swarthmore 8-$.
“We did not have a lot of 
doubles match practice coming 
into the tournament. We played 
well, but were a little rusty and 
were not playing our absolute 
best,” Iyer said. “The champion­
ship match just came down to us 
missing shots we normally do 
not miss.”
In the singles semifinals, 
Staloch faced Wortham. “Ginny 
is a very consistent player,” 
Staloch said. “Her weapon 
against most players is to frus­
trate them by never missing. I 
knew this going into the match, 
as I’ve played her before and 
watched her play a lot.”
Staloch played patiently, de­
feating Wortham 6-4, 6-4. “I 
knew that I had to just show her 
that I could be consistent too,” 
Staloch said. “I had to wait for 
my opportunities and realize 
that she would get to more balls 
than most players. I think what 
helped me win that match was 
just knowing those things and 
staying calm.”
In the championship match, 
Staloch defeated second-seeded 
Tabb 6-4, 6-4. “Katie Tabb is 
an excellent player,” Staloch 
said. “Her biggest weapon was 
her serve. I think after I figured 
out how to get my return back 
against her, I started putting a 
lot of pressure on her service 
games. In the second set, I was 
down 1-4 and came back to win 
it 6-4.1 think that she started to 
feel the pressure, which helped 
me win five games in a row.” 
Staloch moves on to compete 
at the ITA National Small Col­
lege Championships at Florida 
Gulf Coast University in Fort My­
ers homecoming weekend.
On the men’s side, the Tartans 
also found success. On Tuesday 
the men’s team took on Allegh­
eny College in a dual matchup 
at home, dominating the Gators 
with a 9-0 victory.
The win brings the Tartans’ 
season record to 4-1 in dual 
competition and drops the Ga­
tors to 1-3.
Singles matches were won 
by senior Jordan Koslosky 
(6-3, 6-4), sophomore Yiran 
Liu (6-1, 6-1), and first-years 
James Muliawan (6-1, 6-2), Jon 
Spero (6-2, 6-2), Nikola Ljuboja

Bill Maher goes for the kill Did you know?
Political comedian does his shtick at Heinz Hall
The Bush administration has given comics plenty of 
material to work with. Many go after simple things 
like President Bush's struggle with the English 
language, but Bill Maher, host of HBO’s Real Time 
with Bill Maher, goes straight for the jugular.
At a sold-out Heinz Hall show this past Thursday 
evening, Bill Maher brought his classic political 
satire to downtown Pittsburgh. The comic had 
many things to say about the Bush administration. 
An opening joke mocked President Bush's pro­
democracy rhetoric, and continuing his assault, 
Maher called it the "let’s-not-and-say-we-did 
administration” in its handling of the Iraq war and 
the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. According to 
him, Bush’s policy for funding the Iraq war, Katrina, 
and the Medicare prescription drug plan is to “put it 
on the card ... not unlike a spoiled rich kid.”
Bush appointees did not escape scathing comments. 
Maher recounted the story of W. David Hager, 
who as an appointee to the Advisory Committee 
for Reproductive Health Drugs in thè Food and 
Drug Administration advised women suffering 
from severe menstrual cramps to read scripture as 
a remedy. Hager was later accused by his former 
wife of anal rape, for which his excuse was that 
: he missed..Criticizing the policy of encouraging 
i abstinence education, Maher quoted statistics
S that show the average teenage girl who took an 
j abstinence pledge is four times more likely to 
! engage in anal sex.
After attacking the pharmaceutical industry's 
strategy of making up diseases in order to market 
drugs (shyness is now called social anxiety disorder), 
Maher prophesized that one day they will come up 
with à drug for morning erections.
Addressing the issue of religion, Maher declared,
\ “I hate religion, but I’m not against God or 
spirituality.... Jesus was a great role model; it’s just a 
shame that Christians don’t act like him. "Poking fun 
at the Republican Party's apparent religious bent, 
Maher said, "Jesus was all about tolerance. He hung 
out with prostitutes, lepers, tax collectors ... but 
would have drawn the line at Tom DeLay.”
Maher read directly from Rick Warner’s The Purpose- 
Driven Life in a lampoon of literally interpreting the 
Bible with creepy sexual innuendo: "Noah caused 
God immense pleasure." President Bush's open 
religiosity did not escape a verbal licking. "George 
Bush believes that God made him President. George 
Bush is not sure of evolution.... Gravity needs more 
study too; it could just be angels pulling your pants 
down.” Figuring out the reason for conservative 
Christians' continued support of Bush, Maher joked, 
"Bush is big with religious people because he works 
in mysterious ways."
In between the satire-heavy material, Maher 
also showed that he can make a joke about pop 
culture, although always veiled by real news: “A
brain-dead woman gave birth to a baby.... I said, 
‘Congratulations, Britney.”’
The perception of Bill Maher as a liberal comic, 
known for his political satire and sociopolitical 
commentary who goes after the right, is false. 
Although Maher is certainly no Bush-lover, he has 
many unflattering things to say about both political 
parties — Maher called the Democrats incompetent 
during his show to thunderous applause from the 
audience. Neither a socialist for attacking Big 
Pharma nor an archconservative for favoring racial 
profiling at airports, Maher supports libertarian 
causes while also being an avid environmentalist.
He has broad political views that prevent the 
label "liberal” from neatly applying to him. Maher 
is chiefly against the established order, and his 
comedy serves as a great way to educate the public 
about the. supposed hypocrisy and stupidity of the 
establishment.
Curiously absent from his material was any . 
reference to the upcoming midterm congressional 
elections this fall. Not once did Maher comment 
on the George Allen racial gaffe or the Connecticut 
Democratic schism. The 2008 presidential election 
was also an absent topic. Maher's material, although 
entertaining, was not new. Most of what he 
commented and joked about came straight from his 
television show or book. Jokes about global warming 
(Surf Idaho!) and illegal immigration made their way 
into, his routine but were given no emphasis; Maher 
may have been testing new material.
Maher’s style on stage is laid-back, which implies 
he is not trying very hard to deliver his material 
because he is confident of its truth. Ironically, he 
attacked the Bush administration’s own certitude.
In the tradition of Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, 
Maher has a knack for black comedy. His political 
commentary may draw laughter, but as far as Maher 
is concerned, the educated and politically conscious 
person should seriously consider crying on the 
inside, regardless of political orientation. Much of 
Maher’s material is lifted from real news stories 
that offer an unflattering picture of politicians, 
government policy, business, the media, or any 
other topic he addresses. Maher does not need to 
put much spin on the news in order to get laughs, 
and the ultimate message of his very entertaining 
routine is that America needs to seriously reconsider 
its priorities.
Real Time with Bill Maher airs on Fridays at 11 p.m. 
on HBO.

The sophomore and first-year classes competed in 
the annual tug-of-war feat of strength. Determined 
sophomores literally held their ground to ensure 
they didn’t lose for a second straight year. They 
barely succeeded, winning 2-1, leaving the 
defeated first-years stuck in the mud.
Hold it right there, you daring Casanova, you. Before 
you attempt to lure in the ladies, The Tartan would 
like to offer you some advice on better pickup lines. 
If you perchance have 10 extra minutes, try the 
tips posted in this issue. In case you don’t have fO 
minutes, here’s a brief on the wrong things to say: 
“You remind me of a woman I used to date,” “i bet I 
can outdrink you,” and “Hey baby, let’s program.”
Carnegie Mellon’s Cut was fenced off so media 
could photograph the campus. Outraged students, 
who for a week could not walk on the lawn, had to 
relocate their games of lawn darts elsewhere. We 
find this strange, as pictures of Carnegie Mellon 
without students playing on the Cut could give the 
idea that we’re socially withdrawn.
Bathroom stalls at Carnegie Mellon reached the 
epoch of the luxurious entertainment experience. 
A performance artist transcended the bathroom 
image by converting one of the University Center’s 
stalls into a fine dining establishment, complete 
with linens, wine, and top-notch cutlery. The dining 
conversation consisted primarily of potty talk, 
occasionally interrupted by flushing.
Police gave two citations to an intoxicated female 
student who was caught, pants down, urinating 
behind the glass bus shelter on Forbes Avenue 
outside of the University Center. The police issued 
her citations not only for underage drinking, but 
also for public lewdness — apparently she was 
wrong in thinking that she was obscured by the 
structure. Hopefully, next time she will at least find 
the protection of a phone booth.

Built to Spill's Doug Martach performs at Mr. Small's. The 
band played songs off their new album, You In Reverse, in addition to fan favorites.
Max Jordan | Photo Staff
Who they are:
Built to Spill was formed in 1992 by Doug Martsch 
in Boise, Idaho. The band released its first full-length 
album, Ultimate Alternative Waivers, in 1993. In 
1994, they started gaining a significant fan base due 
to the release of There’s Nothing Wrong with Love. 
This album was filled with shorter, catchier songs 
and was the band’s first collaboration with producer 
Phil Ek. Ek helped to develop Built to Spill’s sound, 
adding thicker guitar overdubs and layering 
Martsch’s Strained voice.
Warner Brothers signed the band in 1995. With a 
larger budget, Martsch took Built to Spill back into 
the studio and pumped out the critically acclaimed 
Perfect From Now On in 1997. Dominated by songs 
with a more relaxed pace, the album draws more 
from long jams, with guitars weaving in and out of 
each other to produce intricate melodies, between 
Martsch’s less prominent vocals. With this album, 
Built to Spill became one of the most popular indie 
rock bands in America.
The next album, Keep It Like a Secret (1999), 
was met with even greater praise and commercial 
success. This album saw the band, with Ek, dive 
deeper into the layered sound that they had been 
developing in the past, adding more subtle backup 
vocals and ambient overdubs.
In 2001, they released Ancient Melodies of the 
Future, a relatively poorly received album that added 
to their vast canon but did not further it. After this 
release; fans were left waiting eagerly for a new 
album. However, the band took a break from the 
studio for a while (save for Martsch’s 2002 solo 
album) and toured multiple times in the next few 
years.
This April, Built to Spill made a triumphant return 
with You In Reverse, leading with the epic eight- 
minute track “Goin’ Against Your Mind.” The rest 
of the album (not produced by Ek) is a collage of 
the band’s song structure styles, with some songs 
driven by vocals and melodies, and others centered 
on extended guitar jams. Despite the long break 
from studio releases, the band toured multiple times 
between 2001 and 2006.
‘Thanks,’ says Built to Spill
Lead vocalist Doug Martach is awesome.., and polite
The crowd in Mr. Small’s roared with excitement as Doug 
Martsch walked on stage — backpack in tow — accompanied 
by fellow guitarist Jim Roth, bassist Brett Nelson, and 
drummer Scott Plouf (along with a third, touring guitarist).
This night would be the culmination of five months of waiting 
after Built to Spill postponed its huge American tour last 
spring, leaving fans with no live experience to accompany the 
group's latest album, You In Reverse.
The excitement died down as Martsch spent what seemed 
like an eternity setting up a DVD projector in order to run an 
art slideshow during the set. After filling the air with thick 
anticipation, the band was ready to play. The lights dimmed, 
the crowd roared, Martsch picked up his guitar, and they 
were off.
The set began with “Traces" off You in Reverse, sending the 
audience into a groove. Martsch, never wandering more than 
a foot or so from his mic stand, stood, eyes closed, transfixed 
by his own guitar solo as the song escalated towards the 
final chorus. Once the song ended, the crowd went wild 
—: clapping, cheering, and screaming out requests (commonly 
“Keep It [Like a Secret]!”). The band answered these 
exclamations with the glorious opening chord to "The Plan," 
launching into the first verse with the audience dancing and 
singing along. When the song reached the standard ending, 
the band flowed right into an extended outro jam, perfectly 
complementing the already amazing song.
Reaching back into their older catalogue, the band continued 
with “Distopian Dream Girl,” transforming the choppy ditty 
that appeared on There's Nothing Wrong With Love into a 
smooth, loud, rocking anthem.. The crowd clapped along with 
the buildup of . .and let you keep on living,” leading into a 
soaring guitar solo by Martsch.
After the song ended and Martsch responded to the deafening 
applause with.a simple “thanks" (this would be the extent 
of the band's interaction with the crowd, save for Martsch 
asking the crowd for help finding a slideshow that they had 
not yet seen), Plouf started up the driving beat of "Goin’ 
Against Your Mind." The band jammed through the song 
flawlessly, inserting familiar guitar solos between Martsch’s 
powerful vocals. The song cooled down as the third guitarist, 
on his knees, filled the air with slide guitar swells and Martsch 
attended to his tabletop oscillator to control beautiful waves of 
feedback before returning to the mic to lead the song towards 
a powerful end.
The next few songs, including a Gladiator cover and a 
new song, were less familiar to most of the crowd, leading 
audience members to cool down and pay more notice to their i 
newfound hearing loss (after one particular song, everyone 
standing near the stage left speaker could be seen trying to 
clear out his or her right ear and sympathizing with fellow 
temporarily half-deaf fans). Students began to worry about 
catching the last bus out of Millvale.
The lull was broken by the upbeat “Fly Around My Pretty 
Little Miss,” complete with Martsch and Roth "ooo”ing along 
with the melody of the guitar solo. Following with another less 
familiar song, the band lost some of the crowd’s interest, but . 
they more than made up for it with "Conventional Wisdom,” a 
powerful, fast-paced song off the new album. Next, the band 
provided the soundtrack to a video monologue comparing 
America’s violent tactics in the war on terror to the peaceful 
strategies of eco-terrorists.
After the band’s unexpected but welcome political stance 
(one audience member responded with a less-than-kind 
exclamation targeting Rumsfeld), Martsch counted off and 
began the next song with the telling lyric “Once.beginning 
the old favorite "Big Dipper.” The band closed their set with 
"Carry the Zero,” arguably their most popular song. The 
thick production of the song on “Keep It [Like a Secret]’’ 
was perfectly replicated on stage as the guitars meshed 
seamlessly to create a gorgeous soundscape.
Responding to the crowd's incessant applause and cheering, 
the band returned to deliver an epic, 20-minuteversion of 
"Broken Chairs" as their encore. Martsch led the band through 
the lengthy jam with commanding guitar solos and ambient 
oscillations. By the end of the song, all three guitarists had 
harnessed their distorted feedback into a massive flame that 
melted every face in the audience. After five minutes of dying 
feedback, manipulated by the guitarists as Plouf and Nelson 
packed up their gear, Martsch called it quits and gave one last 
"thanks” to the audience.
Despite his calm and cool demeanor, Martsch could not ignore 
the flailing arms of the front row audience, as he leaned over 
to shake their hands with a warm smile.

Love conquers all at Mates of State concert
Strong headlining duo make up for weak openers at Mr. Small's
Love isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when 
attending a concert, but at Mr. Small’s last Sunday, Mates 
of State shared their love with a packed crowd. The band 
formed in 1997 when Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, then 
living in Lawrence, Kan., realized they could turn their love 
for each other into complementary harmonies and catchy 
melodies. The two married in 2001, had a daughter, and 
haven't looked back since.
Ennui, a band from Pittsburgh, and the Starlight Mints 
opened the concert. Unfortunately.for them, the mob of 
people came for Mates of State and were not that receptive 
to the smaller bands, which suffered from a lack of variety 
in the sound of their songs, particularly the Starlight Mints. 
The fivesome from Norman, Okla., could tell, too, and that 
was one of the saddest parts. Pleas from the band for more 
energy from the crowd went unheard. At one point, Marian 
Nunez (keyboards, flute, and vocals) mentioned she would 
be at the back of the room after their set. After a minute of 
uncomfortable silence, Ryan Lindsey, her bandmate, said, 
"They aren’t even paying attention. Are you guys?” Luckily 
a group of high school girls (one of many) yelled, “We are
— just for you!”
After the Starlight Mints left the stage, Gardner and 
Hammel waltzed onto the stage and started setting up their

instruments — Gardner her keyboard and electric organ, 
Hammel his humble drum set. They were so nonchalant and 
normal-looking, people in the crowd were asking, “Is that 
them?” and answering, “I don’t know.” The couple spent 
about 10 minutes setting up, talking closely to each other, 
and staying completely blind to the crowd eagerly awaiting 
their performance. It was a common theme with the Mates
— they had a closer bond with each other than they ever 
had with the crowd. Still, it was cute to watch as the two 
finished up their conversation, walked slowly over to their 
respective instruments, gave each other a knowing glance, 
and started playing.
All through the night they played songs from their two 
latest albums, Team Boo (2003) and Bring it Back (2006).
The only time they deviated from this normal regimen was 
when they broke into Gnarls Barkley’s "Crazy" right in the 
middle of their own “Like U Crazy.” Gardner majestically 
slowed her piano playing, and the cover they played was 
like Barkley’s version on morphine. Regardless, it was an 
enjoyable segment, and after about two minutes it was right 
back to “Like U Crazy.”
contact with the crowd. Gardner was only slightly less 
withdrawn, sometimes even starting to dance as she played 
and sang. Still, somehow, the show had energy.
After the first two bands, it was a surprise to find the 
audience still there — they were so quiet one might have 
thought they all went to sleep. When Mates of State started 
playing, they opened one eye to check out what all the noise 
was about. The noise was about a married couple playing 
their amazing, poppy music, because it's what they love 
doing.— not because the audience encouraged them.

The woman who made orgasms awkward
When Harry Met Sally writer Nora Ephron speaks at Heinz Hall
Nora Ephron may be 65, but she still has the chutzpah to work 
a crowd. She demonstrated this while speaking about her 
writing career this past Wednesday at Heinz Hall in the Cultural 
District as part of the Pittsburgh Speakers Series. The critically 
acclaimed screenwriter, most notably of the Academy Award- 
nominated When Hany Met Sally, had the crowd in hysterics 
over everything from parenting skills to orgasms.
Ephron, daughter of screenwriter parents, admits it was 
her mother who sparked her interest in writing. "When 
someone was mean to me in school, I would run home to tell 
my mother, but she wouldn't hear it. 'Everything is copy,’ 
my mother would say. "When you can turn your sorrow into 
comedy, then I'll listen.'" Ephron did not begin her career 
as the comedic writer she is known as today, but rather as a 
journalist. A self-named "lover of facts,” Ephron never thought 
she would follow in her parents’ footsteps to script movies. 
Ephron became a reporter for the New York Post in 1962 
after majoring in journalism at Wellesley College and wrote 
freelance for magazines such as Esquire and Vogue. It was not 
until she filed for divorce from her first husband, journalist Dan 
Greenburg, that Ephron decided to trade facts for fiction and 
break into the film industry.
Ephron's most famous movies include This is My Life,
You’ve Got Mail, Silkwood, Sleepless in Seattle, and When 
Harry Met Sally. The last three films received Academy 
Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Although 
the sole screenwriter for these films, Ephron claims that 
collaboration is what really makes a film successful. Take 
the infamous "orgasm scene" in When Harry Met Sally, 
when Sally (Meg Ryan) fakes an orgasm in the middle of a 
crowded restaurant to prove to Harry (Billy Crystal) that all 
men aren't the sex gods they claim to be. Originally, Ephron 
had written that Sally would reveal this secret to Harry in a 
private setting during a one-on-one conversation between 
the two characters. But after the first read-through with the 
actors, Ryan offered the idea for Sally to fake the orgasm in 
a restaurant. Crystal then recommended that in the final line 
of the scene, another woman customer should say, “I’ll have 
what she’s having."
Ephron said this wasn't the first case in which actors gave 
input to the script. She said that Tom Hanks, the lead in 
Sleepless in Seattle, would often improvise his character’s 
lines to make them more "manly.” With a shrug Ephron 
remarked, “As a woman, it is easier for me to write lines for 
women characters than male characters. When Tom told me 
that his character's line was too feminine, I would ask him, 
‘Well, Tom, what would you say in this situation?' and then I 
would type up exactly what he said.”
More recently, Ephron directed last year's Bewitched, starring 
Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. She wrote the novel Heartburn, 
the hysterical personal account of her divorce from her 
second husband, which was made into a movie starring Jack 
Nicholson and Meryl Streep. The book Ephron is currently 
promoting, I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on 
Being a Woman, was published this year and details her own 
panic-stricken battle with old age and the idea of mortality.
Ephron is lauded by critics as "the revivalist of romantic 
comedy,” but, she also has an amazing ability to connect 
with people on a personal level. She speaks to her audiences, 
whether through the microphone at Heinz Hall or through 
her films, with the amicability of a good friend who wishes to 
give others advice. "Every 10 years, do something you don’t 
know how to do,” she recommended, crediting her career 
transitions from journalist to screenwriter to film director for 
her ability to maintain her creativity. But more appealing than 
her exciting career is Ephron’s buoyant personality: “If you

Made [illegal] in China
Pitt screens Sandstorm as part of its International Week
as the "breath,” the life force behind everything and the 
fundamental element behind all creation. Qi is the energy 
that all things in existence — including our human bodies
— give off.
This past weekend, the University of Pittsburgh showed 
Sandstorm, an influential movie about the persecution of 
Falun Gong practitioners, to the students and residents of the 
Pittsburgh area as part of Pitt’s International Week.
Sandstorm is a tale about the events occurring in modem 
China, where people passionate about their beliefs are 
being persecuted. The story is about a police officer who 
has witnessed these acts. He has flashbacks as he tries to 
discern the line between good and evil. It is a movie about 
compassion and persecution and it serves as a wake up call 
to the reality of what goes on behind closed doors to our blind 
eyes.
Sandstorm, though a fictional drama, describes first-hand 
accounts of the persecution that is occurring in China. 
Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have 
been documenting these crimes against humanity.
Falun Gong is a spiritual and religious movement that 
incorporates Taoist and Buddhist principles, healing 
techniques, and Qigong, a practice that exercises the body, 
mind, and soul. Falun Gong is also seen as a way of life.
The practice of Falun Gong falls into two categories: First, 
it is a moral philosophy of improving the self; second, it is 
a set of five "qi” exercises including movements and lotus 
postures that are done to Chinese music. Qi is interpreted
The Chinese government declared the practice of Falun 
Gong illegal in mainland China in 1999. In April of that year, 
10,000 people gathered at the headquarters of the People’s 
Republic of China’s government. Although this dispersed on 
a peaceful note, it caught the attention of many influential 
leaders. The fact that there was an organized protest at 
the headquarters of the Communist Party — despite how 
peaceful it was — scared leaders such as China’s former 
president Jiang Zemin. This newfound jealousy and fear of 
organized protest caused the disturbing prosecution of Falun 
Gong. As of July 2006, there have been 2878 reported cases 
of Falun Gong practitioners that have passed away while 
in the hands of the Chinese police and government. There 
have been more then 30,000 cases of persecution. There are 
reports that hundreds of thousands of practitioners have 
been detained, and over 100,000 have been sentenced to 
labor camps. Furthermore, there is evidence documented 
regarding the torture and abuse of those imprisoned.
Sandstorm is a movie that the Chinese government does not 
want you to see. Despite the dramatic increase in economic 
growth China has experienced in the past decade, China's
human rights behavior has not improved. China has tried 
to prevent Sandstorm's viewing; Chinese embassies and 
consuls in many countries have demanded that the movie 
not be shown as scheduled at several film festivals.
In September of 2004, during the Houston Film Commission, 
the Chinese consul in Houston demanded that Sandstorm 
not be shown. In November, during a San Francisco showing, 
the Chinese consul there also tried to sway the festival not 
to show the movie. In both cases, Sandstorm was shown 
anyway. Sandstorm won Best Feature Film in both festivals 
and has gone on to win 29 film festival awards, including the 
Humanitarian Film Award at the Long Island International 
Film Expo and the Grand Jury prize at the New York 
International Independent Film & Video Festival.
Annie Gui Qing, a student at Pitt, said, “I can’t describe the 
feelings of unjust that filled me during the film. I want more 
people to see this movie; I want more people to care about 
the not-so-beautiful things in our world.”

Pi is a black-and-white movie made

awesome cinematography and no­

The Wachowski brothers bring

This movie could be really cool,

the Wachowski brothers decided 
that everyone had the IQ of a tree

without having the meaning 
shoved down their throats. Just 
wait until Natalie Portman is 
screaming in the rain, and then, 
just in case you missed it, there is 
the scene of her master doing the

it’s a pretty okay movie.

Blue men rock, they don’t conform
The Blue Man Group’s Megastar Tour is a high-energy feast of rhythm, dance, and life lessons
"Every morning I put it on. I walk outside and I am gone."
That is the first line of “Persona," a song by the Blue Man 
Group, though they are not the singers. The Blue Man Group 
features guest singers for their music; the men stick strictly to 
percussion and tomfoolery. This song, similar to many on The 
Blue Man Group's CD The Complex, is about the mask you 
must wear at work or in the company of others. Conforming 
can destroy you, the CD — and the perfomance — says over 
and over.
The men aren’t just enigmas because they are blue. They 
are strange because their performances are part humor, part 
dance, part music, and part message. At the How To Be A 
Megastar Tour, the message stands out.
Last Saturday at Mellon Arena, the show opened with Tracy 
Bonham; she sings vocals on several of their songs. Her music 
and performance were low-energy in comparison to the Blue 
Man Group, so the fit was clumsy at best. Bonham’s first and 
last sets were the best, especially her last song, “Shine.” Her 
guitar work lent little to the performance — she has a band 
to back her up, so she may as well use it. As a violinist, she 
conjured much better results. After embarrassing herself 
with a boring cover of a miserable song, Beyonce Knowles's 
"Crazy in Love," Bonham left the stage. She was, as could be 
expected, much more impressive when she worked with the 
Blue Man Group.
Immediately when they entered, the men showed themselves 
to be versatile on the stage as well as with percussion. 
Jumping, dancing, catching gumballs in their mouths — they 
were one with the rhythm. They never upstaged the music, 
but unfortunately they were sometimes upstaged by the video
productions going on behind them. Two or three (depending 
on the song) large TVs dominated the set, showing music- 
video-like productions to accompany many of the songs. In a 
huge venue like Mellon Arena, the performers themselves, no 
matter how much their color makes them stick out, got lost 
in front of the screens. It would have been better to be a lot 
closer and to not have to rely on watching the screens to see 
the group’s facial expressions.
I've been a fan of the group since I popped The Complex into 
my computer a few years ago. When telling people I was a fan, 
I often got the response "Aren’t they, like, a performance art 
group?” I had never seen them live. Even having seen some 
video footage of them, I was still impressed by the pipes, 
wipes, and other odd instruments they used. They even had a 
grand piano set on its side with the innards exposed.
Since I'm familiar with all the Blue Man songs-off The 
Complex, from which the Megastar Tour takes most of its 
act, I was more excited to see the Blue Men in action, and 
the fun stuff between sets. The videos add a lot more to the 
performance when used for humor. Throughout, the small 
clips included spoofs on Ron PopeU’s infomercials, with 
Popeil’s “brother" selling such things as a champagne funnel 
or a soundproof box for your overzealous guitarist. There was 
also a ridiculously funny piece where the rock star “Mono” 
told you about his latest charitable cause — finding new ways 
to use your “old, boxy television set.”
More humor would have been welcome. The group had great 
coordination with stunts such as catching small gumballs in 
their mouths, and everything worked towards a parody of the 
traditional rock concert. Even the gumball sequence takes 
place because the band is trying to create “unique souvenirs”
to give to the audience. The more unique, the announcer 
said, the more you can charge for them. Yet since the caution 
against comformity is so dominant and often dark, the humor 
became almost too welcome. Laughing with the group 
became a relief that I wanted more and more.
I was half-disappointed by how closely the performance 
follows the CD, but the moments when the act was surprising 
took the show from good to great. At one point the Blue 
Men started doing “tribute covers," and after a small bit of 
Madonna’s “Like a Virgin" one of them put on a white veil.
The more serious, full-length covers of Pink Floyd and The 
Who rocked, too. So what if you couldn’t hear Bonham on the 
violin during the solo in “Baba O’Riley"? It was worth it to see 
the beat being provided by two Blue Men playing on some 
sort of tube-and-.wire apparatus.
I'll never stop loving the song "Persona” or the title track from 
the album. I still feel both tracks paint a picture without these 
zany men, but now that I've seen them I think I would have 
preferred less familiar music. Sure, the group can be heavy- 
handed in their message. They are different enough, perhaps 
even blue enough, though, to get away with it. They present a 
visual and aural feast.

Piano party of five
Family group attracts unlikely fans to classical musicpSjPaperhouse
BgttBaBEfiMHGIobal media and the local listener3 radio station
The 5 Browns are five classical pianists who certainly 
give credence to the claim that talent runs in the 
family: The 5 Browns are siblings. They are Ryan, 20; 
Melody, 21; Gregory, 23; Deondra, 25; and Desirae,
27. They studied at Juilliard, one of America’s best 
conservatories, during the same five years.
The 5 Browns performed at the Byham Theater 
downtown last Wednesday in a concert presented 
by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. It's easy to see why 
the Browns are so popular — their introductions and 
their music reveal boundless enthusiasm for what 
they do. Their body language (bobbing their heads, 
swaying their bodies during the performance) showed 
their pleasure. They were having loads of fun playing 
classical music, which was enjoyable to watch and hear.
They also related the music to the audience. Gregory 
and Ryan said that the "Malagueña" from Andalucía 
Suite by Ernesto Lecuona reminded them of the movie 
The Mask of Zono and "brought back fond memories 
Df Catherine Zeta-Jones.” Melody shared her thoughts 
about gargoyles before she played Lowell Liebermann’s 
Gargoyles. Gregory also related Franz Liszt, a virtuoso 
pianist in his day, to modern pop music superstars. 
Gregory noted that Liszt suggested turning the piano 
sideways during performances so that women could see 
him play. The Browns draw people to them and, in turn, 
;o classical music. The program stated: “The Browns 
nave discovered that almost a third of their audience 
las seldom, if ever, attended a concert of classical 
nusic, and another third is college-age or younger.”
ÍThe Browns exude an aura of youth, and they flaunt that 
youth in the face of tradition. Rather than wearing tuxedos 
and fancy dresses, they dressed more casually. Gregory 
Expressed discomfort at always having to wear a jacket, so 
|ie took it off and threw it across the stage; he then played 
a piece that paid homage to Jerry Lee Lewis. He donned 
olack biker gloves and played a crazy piece culminating in 
nammering the keys with his arms — and a foot.
Fhe 5 Browns perform together in various permutations, 
:he grandest and most unique being when they all 
play at once. Each has a distinct, separate part of 
;he music to play on a different piano. Compositions 
written for five pianos are rare, so most of what the 
3rowns play are five-piano transcriptions. Wednesday's 
Drogram included transcriptions of George Gershwin's 
'Rhapsody in Blue," Stravinsky's The Firebird, and 
Bernstein’s "Scenes from West Side Story."
Lhe 5 Browns owe much of their fame to the fact that 
.hey are all talented siblings, and also that they play 
ive-piano music. The five-piano idea is striking visually, 
)ut the transcriptions used by the Browns were weak. 
?ive pianos were not needed to accomplish the pieces’ 
nusical demands. The works themselves, originally 
>rchestral, do not take advantage of the possibilities 
ifforded by having five pianos.
t would be nice to see the Browns commission some 
ive-piano music, rather than just play transcriptions, as
five-piano music has some intriguing possibilities. The 
piano typically produces a very clear; transparent sound 
that can be very percussive and sharp; five-piano music 
can be very dense and contrapuntal and at the same 
time remain clear. The piano’s pedals allow for a smooth, 
connected sound that is sustained for a while after a key 
has been struck. When notes are pedaled on different 
pianos, the sonority becomes very round and sounds 
like a choir of woodwinds or brass. Given this, pianos 
can generate a variety of interesting sounds that lend 
them great potential. Pianos also have great overtones. 
When a low note on the piano is struck, it implies other 
notes up the keyboard. The piano also allows chords 
and harmony to overlap, creating opportunities for 
sonorities. During the Browns’ performance, the piano 
lids were kept closed. This is necessary for the five- 
piano music due to balance, but the piano lids were 
kept closed during solos and one-piano, four-hand music 
also, which was very frustrating as the sound was dim 
and one-dimensional.
The Browns also play in conventional permutations. 
Gregory and Ryan played a two-piano work, while 
Desirae and Deondra played a one-piano, four-hand 
piece. These two genres are common. The Browns also 
scattered some solos throughout the program; Gregory 
played Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6" and Melody 
played Liebermann’s Gargoyles.
Individually, the Browns never gave the listener an 
opportunity to question their virtuosity, even during 
terribly difficult points in the music; however, their ability 
to play together and interact during the five-piano music 
has not yet reached full maturity. "Rhapsody in Blue" 
suffered from a slow tempo and some hesitation. “Scenes 
from West Side Story" showed the Browns at their best, 
when they were so comfortable that they could treat 
the performance as a casual conversation rather than a 
scripted, practiced affair. Some fantastic pedaling in the 
Stravinsky piece created wonderful sonorities akin to 
woodwinds. In general though, brilliance was sporadic 
rather than frequent.
The solos were fine enough. Some of the playing 
sounded very student-like; there was a limited range 
of articulation, virtually every note was pedaled, and 
expression was limited. But let's not kid ourselves- 
the Browns would likely not be a phenomenon if each 
pursued a solo career. There are so many pianists out 
there who are young and exponentially more talented 
than the Browns, such as Lang Lang, 24, who has 
played with major orchestras around the world, or 
Jonathan Biss, 22, who is a rising chamber musician 
and concert pianist who will appear with the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra the weekend of March 22.
The Browns are a fun introduction to classical music. Being 
a family that plays five-piano music is unique and they 
execute this idea well. The classical world, though, has 
much more to offer than transcriptions and gimmicks.

We are all part of a global community!
You hear that all the time now. Weil, the fact is, a global community might as well be no community. What we call the global community 
is really just a term for the gray uniformity of the globalized media. When the same story runs in Topeka and Miami, in Bangor and Burbank and Bangkok, it must speak to the common denominator 
of all those audiences, tt cannot express a human perspective, being forced instead to synthesize its human elements into a sort of bland universalism, and it has no capability to provide much in the way of “local color.”
But the greatest problem of the globalized media is trust. As 
media outlets become more far-flung, as stories have to be turned around in shorter and shorter periods to meet the demand of an ever-more-ravenous 24-hour audience, a certain expediency 
must be adopted regarding traditionally important principles like accountability. If editors no longer have time to check apostrophes, who, then, is checking facts? In days past, different publishing or 
broadcast organizations could rely on their reputations and those of their personnel to reassure the readers of the integrity of their copy. 
But institutional integrity has proved short-lived: Now a segment on a cable news network is increasingly indistinguishable from the ads that paid for it, and the onscreen anchors who deliver it are 
indistinguishable from actors.
How is the discriminating reader to deal with such an affront? As the mainstream media are increasingly defined by their dual nature as global and commercial enterprises, broadcast media that are both 
locally produced and noncommercial in character are becoming increasingly important anchors for citizens searching for transparency and probity. Local print media (like The Tartan) find that being grounded in a community is as much an asset to their readers as 
USA Today's breadth of distribution is to its shareholders. Similarly, local broadcast media (like Carnegie Mellon’s own radio station, 
WRCT) offer a dual benefit; They provide a candid, locally-grounded perspective to their listeners, and also act as the voice of their community.
As the globalized media fill more and more of the airwaves with emptiness, more of the audience is changing the channel. We may 
be part of a global village, but it turns out the locals have a few things to say.

Gathered in front of the Carnegie Library in Oakland, the riders of Critical 
Mass patiently anticipated the start of their monthly event. Critical Mass 
is a group comprising riders fiom all over the area gather together to ride 
through the streets of Pittsburgh on the last Friday of every month. The 
nders arrived this past Friday ready to brave 50-degree temperatures, 
biting winds, and the onset of rain. Despite the unfavorable weather, 
numerous people showed up ready to ride. Parents, children, college 
students, particularly able-bodied senior citizens, anyone and everyone can 
participate in Critical Mass. Much debate exists about Critical Mass and its 
effect on not just the Pittsburgh community, but communities in towns and 
cities around the world. Hundreds of bikers get together and ride in a pack, 
Tour de France-style, through major city streets, gaining supporters but 
often enraging drivers, too.
Critical Mass is often interpreted as a stunt in which bikers cause major
jn the pack. Some Critical Mass riders disagree with the idea that Critical 
Mass causes traffic problems, though. "(Critical Mass] behaves like a funeral 
procession and causes far less of a delay for any given driver than a Steelers 
game would,” said Daniel Papasian, a 2006 Carnegie Mellon alumnus who 
used to participate in Critical Mass. “Two hundred people on bikes pass 
through a given point far more quickly than 200 singie-occupant vehicles.’’
Michael Cruz, president of Carnegie Mellon’s Cycling Club, does not agree 
with Critical Mass, and points to a practice known as “corking” as one of 
the reasons. Corking is an act of questionable legality by which riders block 
side streets to allow fellow riders to pass down a main street without having 
to worry about cars in the midst of the group of riders. This often causes 
major traffic in already congested areas.
Cruz, a senior decision science and cello performance major, also spoke of

his love for bikes and riding. “I got a job at a bike shop as soon as I came 
to college. Since then. I’ve met so many different kinds of bike riders
— from other racers to commuters, people who tour across entire countries, 
messengers, and people that just want to ride with their family to stay in 
_i_—-------3 |j|jU|--------.3----------¦ so many different types
it comes to issues
on
Papasian has participated in Critical Mass in Washington, D.C., and
i’s really no comparison — Pittsburgh Mass is far larger, 
and it’s much more serious of a bike ride," he said. “In D.C., far fewer people 
ride Mass — and perhaps because of a desire to make up for the size, 
the bicyclists end up being much more defensive, and many would say 
aggressive. Riding Mass in Pittsburgh is a great way to relax on a Friday. 
Riding mass in D.C. requires you to get the adrenaline pumping.”
According to most participants, Critical Mass hasno official mission; it does 
not seek to cause traffic problems; it is just plain old fun. “I think one of the 
most important functions of Critical Mass is that it helps to build the sense 
of community between cyclists with different interests and backgrounds. 
Everyone celebrates it in their own way,” said Stuart Anderson, a Ph.D. 
student at the Robotics institute.
The perils of biking in a city, of course, still remain. Pittsburgh does not 
make as many special allocations for riders as a few other cities. Bike lanes 
are not common, and with traffic already difficult to navigate, cyclists 
have to worry not only about what they are doing, but also what drivers, 
pedestrians, and other cyclists are doing. Many feel that educating drivers 
and cyclists on bike safety would be a great way to diminish any hostility.
Bike Pittsburgh is the biggest bicycle organization in the Pittsburgh area. 
Bike Pittsburgh provides information for cyclists and non-cyclists; articles, 
legislation concerning bicycles, links to various other bike organizations, 
bike safety tips, and bike trail planners are just a few of the things this 
organization has to offer. Members receive invitations to special events; 
benefits from related organizations (such as Free Ride and various bike 
shops around Pittsburgh), and a weekly newsletter. Bike Pittsburgh also 
works with other groups on projects that are simply focused on creating a 
cleaner, healthier Pittsburgh.
¦
These organizations all see the benefits of alternative modes of 
transportation. “More bike commuting also means lower demand for gas, 
so prices go down. And it reduces our dependence on oil from the Axis of 
Evil, among others. So riding a bike is really a patriotic act,” said Gabriel 
Silverman, a Carnegie Mellon graduate student and frequent Critical Mass 
participant. Silverman also cited points on which Pittsburgh could improve 
public biking, such as incentive programs and bike storage facilities that
could possibly be subsidized by the government.
The non-profit organization Free Ride, which works in conjunction with 
Bike Pittsburgh, is an interesting substitute to the traditional bicycle repair 
shop, and makes a great effort in improving and promoting public biking. At 
Free Ride, anyone can bring in an old bike that has fallen into disrepair and 
learn how to fix it. Customers can fix their own bikes and be educated in the 
ways of bicycle care and diagnostics.
Free Ride runs off donations and the time of numerous volunteer workers. 
Bicycle parts, tools, and other materials are all free. In exchange for these 
services, one simply has to put in volunteer hours at the shop. Free Ride also 
provides a six-week bike mechanics course where students can learn all the
A M

---------------------------------------------------

fundamentals of bicycles, from tires, tubes, and flats, to cranks 
and bottom brackets. Free Ride is especially popular among 
college students because it provides a cheap way to create a 
personal means of transportation.
-*>¦
Some students, like Christina Milo, a junior electrical and 
computer engineering major, use less physically taxing means 
of transportation. Milo rides a Vespa from her off-campus 
apartment to classes as long as the weather is suitable.
Vespa is a line of motor scooters, started in Italy in 1946, that 
recently re-entered the American market. But how practical 
is a Vespa, especially for the average college student?
Vespas are indeed a little costly; the prices range from a 
manufacturer's suggested retail price of about $3199 for an LX 
50 to $5799 for the newest model, the GTS 250. Many would 
argue that a decent used car could be bought for that price. 
However, Vespas are cleaner, involve less maintenance, and 
are more fuel efficient.
“The gas mileage is amazing. I’ve been riding my Vespa 
almost every day since school started, and I haven’t had to 
get gas yet at all," Milo said. "I make short trips, but it’s still 
impressive to get gas once every two months. Also, my gas 
tank is, I think, about one or two gallons. So, when I get gas it 
costs five bucks. It’s hilarious."
I& addition, parking a car is much more difficult than parking 
a bicycle or a Vespa, as cyclists enjoy the benefits of having 
bike racks outside just about every building on campus.
Finding ways to get around any city will always be a 
challenge, but some people believe the overall pros of biking 
outweigh the cons. "Biking in Pittsburgh is pretty easy," said 
Silverman. “Most of the city is within 15 minutes of my door 
by bike.... It’s generally faster to bike anywhere in Pittsburgh 
than it is to drive, especially during the day, and you don’t 
have to worry about parking. It’s also just fun — you hardly 
notice that you’re getting in some exercise."

Media advances include using blogs for news
New moves in blogging hope to influence third-world countries
pillbox ic>\02'.cr6
In this tech-sawy world, diaries have become items of 
the past. When people want to vent their feelings, they 
no longer write in a bound journal and hide it under their 
pillow; people publish their thoughts for the world to see. 
This phenomenon, blogging, has revolutionized popular 
culture.
Blogging began as online diary entries, and the 
bloggers called themselves everything from diarists to 
escribitionists. Great corporations, too, used a similar 
format in their news sections. In 1997, Jorn Barger coined 
the term “weblog," which later evolved to “blog." Though 
blogging seems to be innocent, it was not always this way. 
The first major controversy began with mistaken political 
comments in 1997; allegations of anti-Semitism arose 
surrounding Barger's comments, such as, “Is Judiasm 
simply a religion of lawless racists?” Since then, the online 
journal, or blog, has taken on a new identity as a form of 
communication, as a think tank for new ideas and issues.
Corporations have also adopted the blog. From Sweden to 
the U.S., CEOs and presidents of companies are finding 
it beneficial to utilize blogs in making themselves more - 
personable to their customers and investors. The content 
management systems for several corporations have 
switched to blog form. Fredrik Waka, who created a site 
hased solely for the promotion of corporate blogging, 
advocates the use of blogs for several reasons: building 
customer and media relations, facilitating internal 
collaboration, aiding recruitment, and attaining high 
rankings in search engines. However, Waka believes that 
blogging in corporate environments cannot be helter- 
skelter and that it relies on certain key aspects, such as 
using one’s own voice in blogging yet still maintaining a 
professional atmosphere. This way, he claims, blogs can be 
used as a tool to connect corporations around the world.
Colin Marks, a sophomore information systems major, does 
not view blogs as such a juggernaut. “It's kind of just a 
waste of time to me," he said. Marks occasionally reads 
his friends' blogs, but only in cases of extreme boredom.
“I don't think that it’s an effective form of communication, 
because what you are reading is a stream of consciousness 
that isn’t well formulated and doesn't convey emotion," he 
said.
Another reason Marks gave for his distaste is the potential 
danger of the situation. "Whatever you're putting up there 
is going to be read by somebody you don’t want to [read 
it]," he said. Marks gave an example from when he read 
something about his friend’s love life: "There's certain . 
things about relationships you don’t want to read online." 
He claims the practice of blogging is not prudent for most 
American teenagers. "It’s character-threatening.”
However, blogging does have its beneficial points. On 
Wednesday, Ethan Zuckerman came to speak at the 
University of Pittsburgh as part of the university's global 
studies program and International Week. Zuckerman is 
currently conducting research at the Berkman Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard University, studying 
information technology in developing countries. At 
the International Week event, Zuckerman spoke about 
blogging; he believes that weblogs can be used to close 
gaps in mainstream media coverage throughout the world.
Zuckerman founded Geekcorps in 1999. The program 
sends information technicians from more technologically 
adept countries to developing areas, including Africa, 
Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Central America, to teach 
basic software programming and other technology-focused 
skills. The idea is to enable residents of those areas to 
subsist off their own knowledge. For example, small 
businesses can be built on basic computing knowledge. 
The Geekcorps program has been so successful that it was 
recently announced as one of the Tech Museum Award 
winners.
Zuckerman, too, encourages his workers to keep blogs.
He believes that they are useful forms of communication 
between the workers and the average citizen. Hopefully, 
the messages sent and the experiences described will 
have a lasting effect on the audience.
Some blogs do not carry a message so heavy in world 
change. Rather, some inadvertenly have a huge impact.
For instance, the popular movie Snakes on a Plane 
was defined partially by blogging. The site www. 
snakesonablog.com helped influence different portions 
of the movie; it became a bulletin board for ideas for the 
movie. In fact, the site includes a link to "Snakes on a 
Forum,” from which people can post and collect ideas 
and thoughts. Now that the movie has been released to 
the public, Snakes on a Blog mostly carries humorous 
photographs, fan art, and random posts. The power of 
this site is incredible — it both promoted and shaped the 
movie.
While people like Zuckerman may advocate blogs as a 
tool to change the world, the typical teenager has other 
reasons for the addicting habit. First-year chemistry major 
Derek McQuade is one such teenager. Though he does not 
blog too frequently, he does encourage its use. McQuade 
said, "I don't know why I do it. I just do.” Unlike of many 
bloggers, McQuade does not disclose personal information. 
He usually just allows a description of his day to suffice.
"It’s really just for me. I mean if people read it, that’s great, 
but it really is just for me."

Puppets: Not just for Geppetto anymore
Everyone gets to have sweet, sweet puppet fun at the Black Sheep Puppet Festival
Feeling tied down by massive amounts of work? Want to live 
life without so many strings attached? That's too bad. But 
speaking of strings, how about them puppets?
This month, The Brew House in the South Side will be 
hosting the Black Sheep Puppet Festival for the eighth year. 
The festival “is an international showcase of contemporary 
innovations in puppetry as an art form and performance 
medium," according to its website, www.blacksheeppuppet. 
com.
Once again, puppeteers and artists from all over the U.S. 
and Canada will return for a month-long festival promoting 
puppetry in its modem form. While the resources are paltry 
and the puppets are not extremely high-tech, sincere passion 
for puppetry has been clearly displayed at the past seven 
festivals. Many of the artists return year after year with new 
projects and creations to show off.
Pittsburgh native Tom Sarver, this year’s curator and the 
one who has been integral to the festival since its inception, 
is currently opening a museum called the Tom Museum in 
conjunction with the Mattress Factory. As part of this festival, 
he will be conducting a make-your-own-puppet day at the 
Mattress Factory, during which workshops will be held for 
introductory puppet-making.
The festival started in 1999. A group of artists that worked in 
The Brew House at the time wanted to bring something new 
and different to The Brew House — something that displays 
the cutting edge, experimental forms of puppet,” Sarver said. 
“I was in school in Philadelphia studying painting, had just 
started doing puppet shows, and happened to run into the 
people doing the festival. Getting involved in the puppet
festival helped me get more into it and keep up with it as an 
art form. It was really inspiring for me.”
Sarver described the festival's target audience as “basically 
the arts community in Pittsburgh. The evening shows are 
more edgy and sophisticated — for adults and kids 12 and 
above. But we have stuff for all ages, like the children’s 
matinee.”
In past years, the festival has attracted a mixed crowd, part 
of which is Carnegie Mellon students. According to Sarver, 
“The festival features not only puppet shows, but also art that 
explores the boundaries of puppetry such as performance art 
or theater groups that use puppets, which makes it a great 
resource for art students at Carnegie Mellon."
This year, one of the main attractions will be the artist-in- 
residence, Beth Nixon. Nixon, an influential name in the 
puppet scene who holds puppetry performance workshops 
in schools across the country, has participated in several 
previous Black Sheep festivals. She will be creating an 
installation space and, within it, setting up an exhibit 
depicting the interactions between people and animals and 
how the two share spaces. In this installation, visitors and 
puppet enthusiasts will be able to see the puppet-making 
process and an insider’s view into the construction of large 
scale, papier-mache puppets.
Other events include screenings of Jan Svankmajer’s film 
Lunacy, workshops about set construction, and performances 
by international puppeteers. Many of the main stage 
performances are recommended for adults only; however, 
some of the events are designed for the entire family. The 
Fromage Du Jour Players will be presenting The Stinky
Cheese Man at the family matinee, and Diana Vencius will 
perform her own rendition of Edward Lear's The Owl and The 
Pussycat.
The Black Sheep Puppet Festival is being funded by The 
Brew House Association, the Heinz Endowments, and many 
individual contributors. In addition, the Pittsburgh City Paper 
is its official media sponsor.
This festival promises to be innovative and unusual: Using 
Google Images, search for Black Sheep Puppet Festival to 
get an idea of exhibits from previous years. It may not be Jim 
Henson-esque, or reminiscent of that scene from The Sound 
of Music in any way, but it certainly pushes the boundaries of 
puppetry.

If you haven’t already, now would be a good time to activate the spam 
filter on your e-mail client. Just trust me on this one.
At the vending machine, you will have a hard time deciding between 
Peanut Butter M&Ms and Twix. Go with your nut instincts.
Midterms are coming up. Be sure to put new batteries in you calculator. 
Also, I would probably recommend bribing your TA. Chocolate always 
goes a long way.
Despite all the warnings, you’ll still go over the bandwidth limit. When 
you go to buy a new Ethernet card to go around your 45-day probation, 
you’ll step in a deep puddle and ruin your new Pumas. Bummer.
It’s October! You still haven’t gotten that haircut you’ve been meaning to 
get for weeks, but at least Halloween is right around the comer. You’ll 
have several options for costumes; unfortunately you'll lack the parties 
to go to. On the plus side, your mom thinks you're cool.
It’s been a tough time for you lately. Keep your chin up and things will 
get better. Just remember to study a little bit harder and to eat once 
in a while. If that doesn’t work, avoid getting life suggestions from the 
Horoscope section.
Happy birthday! Your parents totally sent you a present and a card with 
money, but it must have gotten lost in the mail. Just keep waiting, but 
be sure to thank them anyway. Also, tell your mom that she should put 
fewer raisins in her cookies.
Someone out there loves you. I can’t say who because they made me 
promise not to tell. But they're not behind you right now. Hey! I said 
they weren’t behind you! Why did you check anyway? Don’t you trust 
me anymore?
I’m sorry you haven’t been sleeping well lately. Make sure to hug 
your stuffed lobster today because he’s the reason.you haven’t been 
sleeping. It also explains why you tend to wake up bleeding.
It’s going be an easy week to miss class. The weather is getting colder, 
and you just got your hands on every Super Nintendo game ever made 
for your computer. I'd go over and play some Super Mario RPG with 
you, but it’s cold outside.
Always carry duct tape with you. This will come in handy this week 
when your car door falls off while you are on the highway. The duct tape’ 
won’t be to graft the door back on, but to tie up the driver of the car you 
wrecked. It’s okay; I won’t tell anyone what you do with the body.
Congratulations on passing your physics test! You studied hard and it 
paid off. Unfortunately, you’ll get over-confident and fail the course. See 
you next semester!
