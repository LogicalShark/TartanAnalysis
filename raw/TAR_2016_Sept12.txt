On Saturday morning, 
leaders of student organiza-
tions ranging from Dancer’s 
Symposium to Math Club 
gathered in the Cohon Center 
for the ?rst ever Conference 
for Social Change, hosted 
by Student Body President 
Vaasavi Unnava and Vice 
President Aaron Gutierrez’s 
cabinet.
A key component of their 
campaign for the of?ce in 
the spring was their “model 
for social change,” centered 
around their idea of the 
President’s Initiative. They 
proposed to “mobilize club 
presidents around a com-
mon issue, and reward the 
clubs and organizations that 
provide innovative cultural 
solutions on our campus.” 
The Conference for Social 
Change is the realization of 
this campaign promise.
At the onset of the event, 
senior Electrical and Comput-
er Engineering major Arnelle 
Etienne, the cabinet’s director 
of advocacy and conference 
organizer, told the group, 
“Today is the starting point.” 
The conference’s goal was to 
unite student leaders around 
conversations on Carnegie 
Mellon’s social issues in or-
der to open doors for group 
collaboration throughout 
the year.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno offered an 
opening address to inspire 
the student leaders. She 
re?ected on students in the 
past who have inspired her 
with their collaboration and 
impact, and she reminded the 
students in the room of our 
collective “commitment to be 
agents of change.”
During two sessions, 
students had the choice of 
six conversations to join, 
facilitated by students and 
staff currently working on 
those issues on campus. The 
options included: race rela-
tions, led by senior Mechani-
cal Engineering major Randy 
Garcia and M. Shernell Smith, 
Assistant Director for the

A multimillion dollar joint 
initiative between Carnegie 
Mellon University and the 
Pennsylvania Department of 
Transportation (PennDOT) to 
implement a series of safety 
improvements to Forbes Av-
enue is slated to begin in the 
fall of 2017, and continue until 
2018. The initiative consists of 
two projects: the Forbes Av-
enue Betterment Project and 
the Oakland/Carnegie Mellon 
Forbes Corridor Safety Im-
provements Project, and is ex-
pected to bring major changes 
such as creating bike lanes, re-
paving Forbes Avenue, and re-
vamping pedestrian crossings 
at intersections.
The proposed modi?cations 
were announced at a public 
meeting held at the Cohon 
Center in late August, and 
came as a response to two 
accidental bicycle deaths 
within the last year. Ten 
months ago, an adviser from 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
Susan Hicks, was fatally 
struck by a car as she was bik-
ing home on Forbes Avenue. 
McKees Rocks resident Den-
nis Flanagan also died when 
he was hit by a truck while 
biking on West Carson Street 
two weeks ago.
The deaths ignited a 
yearlong push to address cy-
clist and pedestrian safety on 
Pittsburgh roads. At the same 
time, Carnegie Mellon had 
also been considering plans 
to update Forbes Avenue to 
better accommodate cyclists 
and pedestrians since 2011. 
At the town meeting held 
by PennDOT and Carnegie 
Mellon University on Aug. 31, 
the room was packed with 
people who passionately ad-
vocated for safer road condi-
tions and questioned details 
of the projects.
One of the signi?cant 
aspects of the announced 
plans was the addition of 
bike lanes on each side of the 
street, which would be four 
feet wide. Consequently, lanes 
for motor vehicles would be 
reduced from four lanes to 
two in some areas. The new 
bike lanes would be installed 
on Forbes Avenue from South 
Craig Street to Margaret 
Morrison Street, as part of 
the Forbes Corridor Safety 
Improvements project, and are 
made possible with a federal 
grant obtained by Carnegie 
Mellon University and the 
Oakland Transportation 
Management Association.
In addition, the current 
traf?c light in front of Ham-
burg Hall would be moved to 
Cyert Drive, while another 
traf?c light would be installed 
at the Collaborative Innova-
tion Center Drive, becoming 
a four-way intersection with 
an entrance to the Tepper 
Quad parking garage once 
its construction is ?nished. 
Other changes include the 
creation of pullovers for bus 
stops, while the bus stop cur-
rently at South Craig Street 
and Forbes Avenue would be 
moved past the intersection. 
To address pedestrian safety 
concerns, a buffer of trees 
would be placed between the 
curb and sidewalks.
At intersections, wider 
pedestrian crosswalks would 
be painted, and all crosswalk 
signals would be updated 
with audible signals. A sig-
ni?cant change will be the 
elimination of the “all-walk” 
phase at the Craig and Forbes 
intersection, despite the fact 
that a lot of the traf?c there 
involves turns.
As part of the Forbes 
Avenue Betterment Project, 
a repaving of Forbes Avenue 
will span from Birmingham 
Bridge to Beeler Street.
The total cost of the projects 
is expected to be around 10 to 
12 million dollars.
A number of people who 
attended the town meeting 
were unsatis?ed, however, 
with what they felt was an 
insuf?cient level of detail 
about the proposed plans 
from of?cials. Some cited 
concern over the safety of the 
bike lanes, and were unhap-
py that bike lanes would not 
extend past Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus.
Dan Cessna, an executive 
of PennDOT Engineering, 
responded that PennDOT 
would be meeting with the city 
of Pittsburgh and the Port Au-
thority over the next month to 
discuss these issues.
“We’re working hard at 
this. It isn’t easy,” Cessna said. 
“We’re very committed to mak-
ing the streets safer. But it’s not 
a neighborhood street as much 
as we might like it to be”.

This year, Carnegie 
Mellon University will join 
in a nationwide movement 
to celebrate and remember 
the 400th anniversary of Wil-
liam Shakespeare’s death. 
Here at Carnegie Mellon, we 
are lucky enough to have a 
copy of Shakespeare’s First 
Folio, a collection of his 
works made near the time 
of his death in the early 17th 
century. As one of only 750 
copies made, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s copy of Shakespeare’s 
First Folio is the most expen-
sive book in the rare book 
collection on campus.
The Folger Shakespeare 
Library, the largest collection 
of Shakespeare’s works in the 
world, will be sending copies 
of the Folio to all 50 states in 
honor of the Bard, but Carn-
egie Mellon University is one 
of the few institutions in the 
world to already have a copy.
There are an estimated 
234 copies remaining of 
the original 750 copies of 
Shakespeare’s First Folio. 
Carnegie Mellon managed to 
obtain one of them due to the 
generosity of one its trustees 
and a life long patron of the 
arts in Pittsburgh, Charles 
Rosenbloom. Upon his death, 
his rare book collection was 
split among several institu-
tions, including Yale Uni-
versity (his alma mater) and 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity. The First Folio has re-
mained in Carnegie Mellon’s 
care since 1974.
Shakespeare’s First Folio 
is currently on display in the 
Posner Center. However, in 
honor of the world’s most 
famous poet, there are now 
also accompanying works of 
the Bard on display. In part-
nership with the School of 
Drama, the Posner Center has 
gathered materials from past 
productions of Shakespeare’s 
works and put them on dis-
play. Each display is focused 
on a speci?c Shakespearian 
play, including titles such 
as “A Midsummer’s Nights 
Dream,” “Macbeth,” “As You 
Like It,” and “Richard III.”
Each of these exhibits 
highlight a past production 
performed by the School of 
Drama. Shakespeare’s work 
was written to be performed 
and, according to Mary 
Catharine Johnsen, the spe-
cial collections librarian in 
the Hunt Library at Carnegie 
Mellon, “Shakespeare’s work 
in theater led him to be quite 
the psychologist.” Many be-
lieve his understanding of 
human nature is what makes 
his plays so powerful. The 
dates of these adaptations 
of Shakespeare’s plays var-
ies throughout the 20th and 
21st centuries, with some 
(such as “Richard III”) hav-
ing multiple innovative plays 
over the past decades to com-
pare. The exhibits are ?lled 
with interesting details from 
the plays, such as directors 
notes on the transcript, or 
original fabric selections for 
the costumes. Students that 
?nd themselves visiting the 
exhibit may ?nd it interesting 
to see the various directors’ 
interpretations of the same 
works throughout the years.
While some may think 
that plays written over 
400 years ago lose mean-
ing when put into a modern 
context, Johnsen disagrees. 
“You can relate to what he’s 
saying…. You read it and go 
‘Oh, I feel that way!’” Part 
of Shakespeare’s appeal is 
that he told stories about 
human beings.
Along with the 
presentation of the First Fo-
lio and the exhibits of the 
past Shakespearian perfor-
mances at Carnegie Mellon, 
there are several other events 
to celebrate Shakespeare’s 
400th anniversary. On Nov. 
4 there will be a dialogue 
between Peggy Knapp, a cur-
rent Shakespearian profes-
sor at Carnegie Mellon, and 
Michael Whitmore, a former 
Carnegie Mellon University 
professor who is now em-
ployed at the Folger Shake-
speare Library in Washing-
ton, D.C. This dialogue will 
take place at the Posner 
Center and will discuss how 
Carnegie Mellon has affected 
the study of Shakespeare’s 
works and how students have 
reacted to the First Folio. It 
will conclude with a Q&A 
session. Furthermore, there 
is a scheduled performance 
of “The Seven Ages of Man” 
speech from “As You Like It” 
on Nov. 13.

It was recently announced 
that Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity renewed its deal with 
Tsinghua University in China 
to offer students at both uni-
versities the chance to learn 
computer science from facul-
ty at the top-ranked computer 
science programs in both 
the United States and Chi-
na. This program will allow 
students to receive degrees 
from both universities.
Both Carnegie Mellon 
and Tsinghua University are 
striving to have this newer 
dual-degree program be ac-
cessible to more students in 
China and in other countries. 
The renewed program will 
also eliminate the previous 
version’s thesis requirement.
Present at the signing of 
the agreement was Jianping 
Wu, a professor at the Chinese 
Academy of Engineering and 
head of Tsinghua’s Computer 
Science Department. Also 
present were Wenwu Zhu, 
professor and deputy head of 
Tsinghua’s Computer Science 
Department, and Jun Zhu, 
associate professor of com-
puter science at Tsinghua and 
an adjunct faculty member of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Machine 
Learning Department.
“This will be a great op-
portunity for students who 
want to maintain strong ties 
with China, but also seek the 
advantages that come with 
credentials from two out-
standing computer science 
programs,” Frank Pfenning, 
head of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Computer Science Depart-
ment, said in a university 
press release.
Students will spend the 
?rst year of instruction at 
Tsinghua University. After-
wards, scholarships will be 
established to support these 
students, who will then ?nish 
their second year of study at 
Carnegie Mellon. About ?ve 
students are expected to take 
part in this program during 
the ?rst year.
Recruitment for the 
program begins in the fall.

Welcome to the first 
weekly Student Government 
column in The Tartan! While 
it would be great to say that 
this installment is the prod-
uct of an overwhelming and 
undeniable outcry by the 
student body to know the 
week-to-week schedule of 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
executives and cabinet mem-
bers, the truth is that student 
government as a whole can 
be a cryptic and overlooked 
subject despite the fact that 
it formulates so much of our 
Carnegie Mellon experience. 
From the tools we have at our 
disposal on campus to handle 
personal emergencies, to 
how we paint the Fence, stu-
dent government inevitably 
has a huge influence on the 
experiences that define our 
day to day lives on campus.
But what exactly does it 
mean to be a part of student 
government? Information 
can be found online that 
briefly explains the concept 
of the agenda that we, as 
the current Student Body 
President and Vice Presi-
dent, have designed and are 
hoping to fulfill in the 2016-
2017 academic year with our 
fellow executives, but details 
are still sparse on what this 
process is actually like. With 
two President’s Cabinet 
meetings under our belt, I 
think we have begun to piece 
together what is required to 
run this government, and 
what students can do to 
get involved.
Student government 
means innovation. To ful-
fill the initiatives of Social 
Change, Fiscal Transparency, 
and Student Government 
Transparency we set up, net-
works must be created by 
like-minded individuals to 
strategize effective outreach, 
to introduce or find new 
ways to support existing uni-
versity programs or projects, 
to coordinate funding for all 
this activity, and more.
Student government 
means constant commu-
nication and representa-
tion. To properly advocate 
for student needs or relay 
information from the uni-
versity to its graduates and 
undergraduates, executives 
must listen to their peers 
to give voice to them and 
offer solutions to produce 
the optimal connections 
between administration and 
leaders on campus. With as-
tute community observances 
and inspiration derived from 
campuses far from ours, 
needs can be met before they 
are even realized.
What we in Student 
Government hope is that this 
column and this year incites 
a tradition of openness, mo-
tivates meaningful conversa-
tion, and inspires reflection 
on what it means to be a stu-
dent at Carnegie Mellon as 
we tackle these three initia-
tives. We hope to hear your 
ideas on what components 
are still missing, or what 
ideas you have to enhance 
the Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity experience. Whether it’s 
dropping by our office hours 
on Fridays to exchange ideas, 
sitting in on a Student Senate 
or Graduate Student Assem-
bly general body meeting to 
learn about other initiatives 
on campus, or reaching out 
to the SBVPO or SBVPF on 
any organizational inquiry, 
there are tons of ways to 
learn about and get involved 
in the growth of Carnegie 
Mellon as an institution and 
as a home to so many.

Of?ce of the Dean of Student 
Affairs; ?nancial literacy and 
security, led by Bonnie Lack 
from the Student Financial 
Aid Of?ce; the international 
community, led by sophomore 
Dietrich student Shubhangi 
Bhotika and Of?ce of Inter-
national Education Director 
Linda Gentile; sexual assault 
and relationship violence pre-
vention, led by ?fth year MFA 
student Shannyn Rinker and 
Jamie Edwards, Assistant Di-
rector in the Of?ce of Title IX 
Initiatives; civic engagement, 
led by junior Civil Engineer-
ing major James Crnkovich; 
and mental health, led by 
sophomore Dietrich student 
Kelly Kim.
During the civic 
engagement conversation, 
senior business administra-
tion and Human-Computer 
Interaction major Vanessa 
Kalu noted, “There’s so 
much intersectionality in 
our interests but we mostly 
operate in silos,” referencing 
the individual nature of many 
student organizations, despite 
all the overlap. She offered 
an example of success, how-
ever; during the water crisis in 
Flint, Mich., SPIRIT partnered 
with Sustainable Earth dur-
ing their inaugural Sustain-
ability Weekend to create an 
overlapping effort.
In order to incentivize suc-
cessful collaboration, the SBP’s 
cabinet has offered $2,000 for 
?scal year 2018 to the initia-
tive with the greatest impact 
during this school year. Or-
ganizers also plan to compile 
the contact information of all 
attendees in order to facilitate 
collaboration in the future.
After the event, Bhotika ex-
pressed, “I hope it grows and 
snowballs into real change.”
Crnkovich, a represen-
tative of Partners Allied in 
Civic Engagement (PACE) 
shared that he has plans to 
connect with students he met 
at the event, and is cautiously 
optimistic about the potential 
for united student organiza-
tions to bring change to cam-
pus. His concern was that em-
phasis more often lies on the 
leaders and starters of change, 
but not enough on the mainte-
nance of the momentum.
In order to focus on the 
follow through, Unnava and 
her cabinet “will be regularly 
checking in with organization 
leaders after the conference to 
help them clarify and execute 
their ideas,” equipping groups 
with the necessary contacts 
and information.
After the event, Unnava 
expressed, “I was deep-
ly moved by the care and 
thought these student lead-
ers are putting into bringing 
social change into the extra-
curricular experience... I can’t 
wait to see what everyone 
does.”

For one week during the 
month of October, Colors @ 
CMU, an organization that 
seeks to spark conversations 
about racial issues on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus in 
an effort to bring together 
people of differing back-
grounds, will be hosting 
its first ever 2-4-1k Grand 
Challenge.
The 2-4-1k Grand 
Challenge will take place 
from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7. Teams, 
consisting of two recognized 
student organizations, one 
of which must be a multi-
cultural organization, will 
be tasked with utilizing a 
monetary budget with the 
goal of collaboratively de-
veloping a project that will 
make a positive impact on 
the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity. Teams are free to 
create any project they de-
sire to ultimately satisfy two 
goals: The project must be 
community based, directly 
involve and increase inter-
actions between Carnegie 
Mellon students, and must 
show tangible results by the 
end of the week.
The aim of the project is 
based on Colors @ CMU’s 
goal to bring together mem-
bers of different student 
organizations whose paths 
would not normally cross. 
“While there are many 
amazing cultural organiza-
tions out there at CMU, you 
don’t really see them inter-
acting with each other,” said 
Chrystal Thomas, a senior 
biological sciences major 
and creator of the chal-
lenge. Colors @ CMU hopes 
this challenge will increase 
collaboration between mul-
ticultural organizations at 
Carnegie Mellon. “We would 
love to see students involved 
in OM (The Organization for 
Indian Spirituality and Cul-
ture) feeling comfortable 
and interested enough to 
collaborate with SPIRIT and 
vice versa, or to see SALSA 
(Spanish and Latin Student 
Organization) collaborate 
with ASA (Asian Students 
Association),” Thomas said. 
“While these groups seem 
[to] have different interests, 
I believe they are actually 
quite similar.”
Thomas believes this 
challenge will help show 
various student organiza-
tions the aspects that they 
have in common, which can 
ultimately motivate these 
individuals to step outside 
of their comfort zones. This 
can allow the members of 
the organizations to not 
only connect over the things 
they have in common, but 
also to create a desire to 
gain new perspectives from 
students with different cul-
tural or racial backgrounds 
from their own.
While the first year of 
college is when many seek 
out their niche on campus, 
this often creates a level 
of comfort that, over time, 
makes it harder to break 
barriers that inhibit us from 
engaging with other campus 
communities. The 2-4-1k 
Grand Challenge seeks to af-
firm the notion that there is 
not a limited time when one 
can partake in self-discovery 
and that we should be open 
to reigniting the bright-eyed 
freshmen desire of meeting 
new and different people.
“I think the idea of the 
2-4-1k challenge is to give 
an opportunity to break that 
barrier and encourage in-
teraction among different 
people,” Sharon Wu, junior 
chemistry major and Colors 
@ CMU e-board member, 
stated. “In that way, I hope 
that the challenge will em-
body what it truly means to 
be a diverse campus. Having 
diversity should not be some 
statistic that admission of-
ficers stick on paper, but 
rather something incoming 
students look forward to, 
as they will be able to learn 
new perspectives and, in 
turn, grow as people.”
Registration for the 2-4-
1k Grand Challenge will be 
open from Sept. 10 to Sept. 
24. The winning teams will 
be announced on Oct. 14. 
The first place winning 
team will receive a $1,000 
cash prize, and second place 
winners will receive $400. 
There are no restrictions 
on these cash prizes, so 
each team can decide to use 
it as they please.
Any questions about 
the challenge, such as a re-
quest to see an overview 
of the rules of the com-
petition, may be sent to 
241kchallenge@gmail.com.
“We’re really looking 
forward to seeing all of the 
great projects in October!” 
Thomas said.

Not only could 200 startups be 
eligible for ?nal submission, 
but all enterprises have to be 
af?liated with a university. 
Some additional companies 
have sprouted from Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, Berkeley, 
and Case Western. This year, 
USDD will be showcasing 35 of 
the most prestigious university 
startups in technology, and 
LumiShield is among these 
select few.
LumiShield aims to 
“revolutionize the metal plat-
ing industry by creating anti-
corrosion products that are 
cost-effective and environ-
mentally responsible,” accord-
ing to the company’s website. 
Metal corrosion cost the U.S. 
economy nearly $276 billion 
last year, and existing anti-cor-
rosion technologies, cadmium, 
and chromium coatings, have 
markets valued at $3 billion 
and $16 billion annually.
The company has targeted 
these costs by developing 
aluminum electroplating 
technologies that are less 
harmful and more affordable 
than current coating options 
on the market. The electro-
plated aluminum shield devel-
oped by LumiShield creates a 
self-healing aluminum oxide 
layer when in contact with the 
air. This allows greater ?exibil-
ity in operation and excludes 
major capital equipment in-
stallations.
Not only was LumiShield 
selected from a competitive 
pool of groundbreaking ideas, 
it has also been named as one 
of the best university startups 
of 2016.
In an email to The Tartan, 
LumiShield’s CEO and co-
founder David Luebke says 
USDD will be “a great op-
portunity to meet people and 
get exposure.”
The Startup Of?cer from 
Carnegie Mellon, Reed Mc-
Manigle, oversaw the col-
laboration and completion 
of the project and brought 
it to national attention. Mc-
Manigle is the current se-
nior manager for the Center 
for Technology Transfer and 
Enterprise Creation at Carn-
egie Mellon. The Center is re-
sponsible for facilitating and 
accelerating the movement 
of research and technology 
out of the university and 
into the marketplace.
According to the company’s 
website, NCET2’s Selection 
Committee, “comprised of 
corporates, angels, and VCs,” 
evaluates the startups based 
on corporate interest and ven-
ture metrics. NCET2 aims to 
merge innovation and entre-
preneurship by bringing to-
gether Fortune/Global 1000 
companies, venture capital-
ists, economic development 
organizations, state and fed-
eral agencies, universities, and 
entrepreneurs.
NCET2’s executive director, 
Tony Stanco, believes that the 
United States “must have a 
sustained commitment to edu-
cation, scienti?c research, and 
startups.” Though Americans 
have pioneered in education 
and research, little attention 
has been drawn to the revo-
lutionary work of inventive 
startups  and their accompa-
nying, trailblazing university 
collaboration.
“Thanks to the support 
from Carnegie Mellon and 
the National Energy Technol-
ogy Laboratory, LumiShield 
technology is poised to make 
a positive impact in a variety 
of industries,” said Luebke in a 
university press release.
“We would love to see students 
involved in OM feeling 
comfortable and interested 
enough to collaborate with 
SPIRIT and vice versa, or to see 
SALSA collaborate with ASA ”

A team at Carnegie Mel-
lon has developed an al-
gorithm to see whether a 
review on Amazon or Yelp 
has been faked or if a politi-
cian has bought their Twitter 
followers.
Christos Faloutsos, a 
professor of machine learn-
ing and computer science 
at Carnegie Mellon, devised 
the method, called FRAU-
DAR, along with his data 
analytics team. This new al-
gorithm will help social me-
dia platforms identify fraud-
ulent users and see through 
the camou?age that makes 
them look legitimate.
“We’re not identifying 
anything criminal here, but 
these sorts of frauds can un-
dermine people’s faith in on-
line reviews and behaviors,” 
Faloutsos said in a university 
press release. 
He noted in that same 
release that most social me-
dia platforms try to ?ush out 
such fakery, and FRAUDAR’s 
approach could be useful in 
keeping up with the latest 
practices of fraudsters.
FRAUDAR relies on graph 
mining, a method analyzing 
data for patterns, which is a 
specialty of Faloutsos and his 
group. 
Each social media inter-
action is plotted on a graph, 
with users represented by 
dots and interactions be-
tween users represented by 
lines.
Using tools like Falout-
sos’ NetProbe, the goal is to 
?nd a pattern called “bipar-
tite core,” which are groups 
of users that interact with 
members of a second group, 
but not with each other. 
This pattern is indica-
tive of fraudulent accounts, 
which follow other accounts 
to in?ate their reputation. 
These frauds have fake in-
teractions with real accounts 
and can post either ?atter-
ing or un?attering reviews 
depending on their purpose.
In recent years, however, 
fraudulent accounts have 
learned how to blend in, 
linking their account to pop-
ular sites and celebrities or 
simply hijacking legitimate 
accounts, which is where 
FRAUDAR comes in.
The algorithm ?rst iden-
ti?es legitimate accounts, 
essentially accounts that fol-
low a few people, who post 
occasional reviews, and have 
otherwise normal behavior.

Genetic researchers identify four distinct species of giraffe
Researchers have recently 
discovered that there are four 
genetically distinct species of 
giraffes. The ?ndings, which 
were published in the journal 
Current Biology, were unex-
pected; all giraffes are quite 
similar in appearance, which 
had previously led to the con-
clusion that all giraffes were 
part of a single species.
Axel Janke, a geneticist at 
the Senckenberg Biodiversity 
and Climate Research Centre 
and the Goethe University in 
Germany, along with a team of 
researchers, took DNA samples 
from 190 giraffes. The subjects 
the study were from a variety 
of regions in Africa and in-
cluded samples from all nine 
previously recognized giraffe 
subspecies. DNA testing of 
the samples indicates that gi-
raffes should be split into four 
genetically distinct species: 
the Southern giraffe (Giraffa 
giraffa), the Masai giraffe (G. 
tippelskirchi), the Reticulated 
giraffe (G. reticulata), and the 
Northern giraffe (G. camelo-
pardalis). The study also sug-
gested that these four species 
of giraffes do not mate with 
each other in the wild.
These ?ndings could 
have a severe impact on gi-
raffe conservation efforts. 
Giraffe numbers have been 
severely declining in the past 
30 years, and the researchers 
hope that these ?ndings will 
bolster support for giraffes.

Device visualizes bacterial resistivity 
to antibiotics
Michael Baym, a research 
fellow in systems biology 
at Harvard Medical School, 
along with a team of research-
ers has developed a device 
that allows researchers to vi-
sualize how microbes become 
antibiotic-resistant.
“Inside that ?ask, in order 
for a new strain to evolve, the 
new mutant has to be more ?t 
than everything around it,” 
says Baym.
The research team used 
a dish over a meter long that 
was coated with different 
concentrations of antibiotics 
— low concentrations at the 
edges and high concentrations 
in the middle. The team added 
E. coli bacteria to the plate 
and let it multiply for a week 
and a half. With this setup, the 
bacteria mutated over time in 
order to handle higher levels 
of antibiotics, and were able 
to move onto new portions of 
the plate. 
This setup allowed re-
searchers to see differences 
in movement — highly resis-
tant bacteria spread across the 
plate more slowly than bacte-
ria with low resistance levels.
The team believes that 
this new setup could also 
help researchers study how 
microbial colonies evolve un-
der other conditions such as 
nutrient availability or spatial constraints.

Improving PTSD brain function with near-infrared light
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Texas (UT) at Arling-
ton have discovered that light 
could potentially be used to 
improve the cognitive function 
of patients with PTSD.
The research team shined 
near-infrared light (NIR) on 
a human forearm and dis-
covered that this treatment 
promoted the production 
of cytochrome-c-oxydase, a 
protein that stimulates blood 
?ow in neurons. Hanli Liu, a 
bioengineer at UT Arlington, 
was the principle investigator 
of the research and explained 
that “this is the ?rst time that 
effects of light stimulation 
have been quanti?ed on living 
human tissue.” Liu also noted 
that the next step is to “apply 
what was learned in a simpler 
system to the brain, where the 
light must pass through the 
scalp and the skull, as well as 
the brain.”
The research team had 
previously found that patients 
with PTSD had decreased 
blood ?ow in the left side of 
the dorsal lateral prefron-
tal cortex. The team believes 
that by using light to promote 
increased blood ?ow, they 
could potentially treat this 
component of PTSD.
The research team is now 
moving towards transcranial 
NIR stimulation in the hope 
of con?rming their initial 
?ndings.

Wilderness reduced by 10 percent since 1990s
World Conservation Soci-
ety researchers have recently 
shown that a tenth of the 
world’s wilderness has been 
destroyed in the past twenty 
years. 
The ?ndings, which were 
published in Current Biology, 
show that the most alarming 
losses are occurring in South 
America and Africa.
The research team cre-
ated a map of wilderness areas 
around the world and com-
pared their ?ndings to a simi-
lar map that was made in the 
early 1990s. They discovered 
that approximately 3.3 million 
square kilometers had been 
lost since the original map was 
made.
The researchers argue that 
this loss demonstrates the need 
for focused attention on nature 
preservation and active rever-
sal of industrial landscapes to 
natural settings. 
James Watson, an associ-
ate professor of geography 
planning and environmental 
management at the University 
of Queensland, noted that wil-
derness areas are “completely 
ignored in environmental 
policy.” 
He argues that “interna-
tional policy mechanisms must 
recognize the actions needed 
to maintain wilderness areas 
before it is too late … we prob-
ably have one to two decades to 
turn this around.”

NASA launches probe to retrieve asteroid sample
On Sept. 9, NASA launched 
Osiris-Rex, a probe that is be-
ing sent to collect a rock sam-
ple from an asteroid called 
Bennu. The probe will spend 
approximately 2.5 years on 
Bennu, and will take seven 
years total to complete its 
journey and collect the rock 
sample. If all goes as planned, 
the sample will be delivered 
to Earth in a capsule on Sept. 
24, 2023 somewhere in the 
Utah desert.
Researchers hope that the 
rock sample will provide clues 
to understanding how the sun 
and the planets were created. 
“For primitive, carbon-rich 
asteroids like Bennu, materi-
als are preserved from over 
4.5 billion years ago. We’re 
talking about the formation 
of our Solar System,” said 
Christina Richey, NASA’s 
Osiris-Rex deputy program 
scientist. “And these primitive 
materials could contain or-
ganic molecules that may be 
the precursors to life here on 
Earth or elsewhere within our 
Solar System.”
Scientists in Japan have 
already completed a similar 
mission, although the U.S. 
mission hopes to bring back 
a larger sample — approxi-
mately a couple hundred 
grams. Scientists in Europe 
are also hoping to complete 
a similar mission to return in 
the late 2020s.

Trilobites show early example of mass migration
Blazej Blazejowski, a pa-
leobiologist from the Polish 
Academy of Sciences, along 
with a team of researchers, 
has discovered that trilobites, 
a type of extinct marine inver-
tebrate animal, could be one 
of the earliest examples of 
mass animal migration.
Blazejowski’s team of re-
searchers investigated a fos-
sil from a quarry located in 
central Poland along with 80 
others, all of which showed 
trails of trilobites moving in 
single ?le. 
Blazejowski explained that 
the animals “may have mi-
grated periodically to shallow 
marine areas for mass mating 
and spawning.”
Since trilobites are blind, 
the researchers believe that 
they used chemical cues in 
order to form their single ?le 
lines. 
This process can be seen 
in other animals such as lob-
sters, which also migrate in 
single ?le. 
It is believed that trilobites 
were eventually killed by tox-
ic amounts of carbon dioxide 
and hydrogen sul?de in the 
ocean ?oor.

Have you ever tried to spice 
up your Snapchat streaks with 
the hilarious, face-distorting 
?lters? Have you ever felt like 
ripping your hair out after see-
ing upwards of twenty ?ower-
crown-?ltered faces on your  
Instagram or Facebook feed? 
Have you ever wondered how 
these ?lters, called “lenses,” 
even work?
Five years after its ?rst 
launch in July 2011 under 
the name Picaboo, Snapchat, 
an image messaging app, has 
emerged as one of the most 
popular social media apps 
among millennials, with 10 
billion daily video views as of 
April 2016.

technologies, such as the 24-hour 
story (which was recently copied by 
Instagram), temporary text messages, 
and instant video chatting. 
In September 2015, for about 
$150 million, Snapchat purchased 
the Ukrainian company, Looks-
ery, which specializes in real-time 
video modi?cation on mobile devices, 
in order to create Lenses.
Even people who have not down-
loaded the app have most likely been 
exposed to the famous Snapchat ?l-
ters — during the 2016 New York 
Fashion Week, a Spanish clothing 
brand used makeup to recreate the 
most popular lenses on their mod-
els. Lenses have made their way into 
Facebook pro?le pictures, Instagram 
posts, and Twitter feeds, even though 
Snapchat’s uniqueness comes from its 
ephemeral nature.
For almost a year, Snapchat users 
sent billions of pictures and videos al-
tered by Lenses, unaware of the tech-
nology behind it. In late June 2016, 
Vox, the self-described “general in-
terest news site for the 21st century,” 
posted a YouTube video sharing in-
sight into the mechanics of Lenses, 
and although they were not allowed 
to talk to the engineers behind it, the 
people at Vox examined the patents 
available online.
The ?lters tap into a ?eld of tech 
known as computer vision, which 
explores how a computer uses a cam-
era’s pixel data to detect objects. The 
pixel data that the computer sees are 
merely numbers corresponding to 
each pixel that represent a color, so 
the algorithm to detect faces involves 
locating areas of contrast and match-
ing the patterns to typical patterns of 
a face. 
For example, the bridge of a nose 
is often lighter in contrast to the sur-
rounding areas, and the center of a 
forehead is lighter than the sides. This 
algorithm, known as the Viola-Jones 
algorithm, only works with front-fac-
ing angles; if someone were looking 
or tilting their head to the side, the 
computer would not be able to detect 
their face. 
The advantages to the system in-
clude its fast computational abilities 
and its approach to scaling features. 
However, the algorithm is sensitive to 
lighting and, as we mentioned before, 
angles of the face.In addition to recog-
nizing common areas of contrast and 
simply recognizing faces, Snapchat 
must know exactly where each feature 
of the face is in order to accurately 
place its ?lters. 
According to Vox, people behind 
the scenes manually marked facial 
features of thousands of different peo-
ple in order to develop a general tem-
plate that can be applied to every face 
before further adjustments, namely 
rotating and scaling the template, can 
occur. 
After this, Snapchat must yet again 
analyze pixel data surrounding each 
facial feature to make minor tweaks 
in the mesh (or the digital mask). 
Contrasting pixels denote edges such 
as jawlines, eyebrow shapes, and lips.
Following all of this data analysis 
and ?ne-tuning, Snapchat can ?nally 
position the ?lter con?dently, and 
voila — you are now a dog, a lion, or a 
snowboarder with a mustache!
In spite of all of this seemingly new 
aNd innovative tech, detecting faces 
and making alterations is not the new 
technology that makes Lenses incred-
ible — the processing speed required 
to do this in real-time on your mobile 
device is.
So the next time Snapchat lags 
when you are trying to show someone 
a funny ?lter, just think: it is already so 
amazing that we can do this at all, and 
things will only get better from here.

A Carnegie Mellon 
research team from the bio-
engineering and mechanical 
engineering departments has 
published a paper in the jour-
nal Biotechnology and Bioen-
gineering that describes their 
research on a way to control 
localization of tissues, which 
allows researchers to shape 
those tissues as needed. 
This ability has given 
researchers the tools they 
need to mimic the way mam-
malian breast tissues align 
to form hollow tubes for the 
transportation of milk.
“In mammalian bodies, 
breast cells align to form hol-
low tubes, where milk is trans-
ported,” said Jimmy Hsia, a 
professor in the departments 
of Biomedical Engineering 
and Mechanical Engineering 
at Carnegie Mellon and corre-
sponding author of the study, 
in a university press release. 
“To date, no one has been able 
to generate breast tissue with 
these hollow tubes. Our study 
is the ?rst step toward real-
izing such functionalities in 
reconstructed breast tissues.”
According to the article, 
this form of ?ne-control 
over tissue construction has 
never been possible before, 
which makes this creation 
of functional breast tissue a 
very important step in tissue 
engineering.
“We grew breast cells in a 
3-D environment, and they 
aligned themselves along 
certain geometrical features 
of the substrate,” Hsia said in 
the press release.
It was only recently 
determined that mechani-
cal signaling along with bio-
chemical signaling assists 
with changes in the body. 
Though research has 
been done on the effect of 
mechanical signaling and 
its responses, more sophis-
ticated tools were required 
to form intricately shaped 
tissues. Studying one such 
mechanical factor, like the re-
lationship between the stiff-
ness of the substrate and the 
response of the cells in vitro, 
has previously been done, 
but only in two dimensional 
environments. 
The drawback of two di-
mensional environments is 
that it resembles “experimen-
tal conditions” like a glass or 
a petri dish, but not actual 
three dimensional tissues. 
The study conducted 
above mentioned experi-
ment in a three dimensional 
environment and concluded 
that the stiffness gradient of 
the tissue scaffold to which 
the cells bind and take their 
shape, as well as the localized 
stiffness, played a key role in 
how cells moved, as opposed 
to the stiffness of the bulk of 
the tissue scaffold. 
This particular fact 
allowed the team greater con-
trol over speci?c features of 
the tissue’s construction, in-
cluding the spacing between 
tube-like structures.
The setup used in the study 
was a three dimensional ma-
trix with continuously chang-
ing height, an extracellular 
environment with varying 
stiffness gradient, while other 
factors such as ?ber density 
and protein concentration 
were kept constant. 
This experiment was 
conducted on four differ-
ent cell types and various 
substrates. 
However, more research 
needs to be done with re-
spect to other factors such as 
the relationship between cell 
velocity and stiffness gradi-
ent, the adhesion forces ex-
erted by the cells, and the 
displacement of cells.
This study can potentially 
help mothers regain their 
nursing ability after hav-
ing reconstructive surgery, 
which make breasts func-
tional again, along with rein-
stating them to their original 
form, a viable option. This 
method has the potential to 
be applicable in a variety of 
?elds including tissue engi-
neering, regenerative medi-
cine, cellular machines, and 
mechano-biology.
“We know many people re-
ceive mastectomies and many 
of them do reconstruction, 
but none of these reconstruct-
ed breasts are functional,” 
Hsia said in the press release. 
“We believe we’re on our way 
toward achieving that.”
FRAUDAR algorithm detects social media fraudulent accounts
SNAPCHAT, from A6
legitimate accounts, the camou?age 
of the fraudsters becomes more ob-
vious, and bipartite cores become 
easier to spot.
To test the algorithm, FRAUDAR 
was applied to Twitter data from 
2009 for 41.7 million users and 1.47 
billion followers. FRAUDAR was 
apple to identify more than 4,000 
accounts with suspicious activity 
that were previously unidenti?ed as 
fraudulent, including those that 
used TweepMe and TweeterGetter, 
known follower-buying services.
The group selected 125 followers 
and 125 followees at random from 
suspicious groups and two control 
groups of 100 users. 
The accounts were then exam-
ined for links with malware, scam, 
and robot-like behavior.
They found that 57 percent and 
40 percent of the followers and fol-
lowees, respectively, in the suspi-
cious groups were labeled fraudu-
lent. 
In comparison, only 12 percent 
and 25 percent of followers and fol-
lowees in the control group were la-
beled fraudulent.
The group found that 41 percent 
and 26 percent of followers and fol-
lowees, respectively, from the suspi-
cious accounts included advertising 
for follower-buying services. 
There were few mentions of such 
activity found in the control groups.
“The algorithm is very fast and 
doesn’t require us to target any-
body,” Faloutsos said in the univer-
sity press release.
FRAUDAR has been made avail-
able as an open-source code. “We 
hope that by making this code avail-
able as open source, social media 
platforms can put it to good use,” 
Faloutsos said.

If you’re like me, the word “frack-
ing” calls to mind viral videos of 
Yoko Ono dancing with an in?at-
able earth and people lighting their 
tap water on ?re, all tinged with a 
touch of confusion. Fracking is one 
of those topics that manages to be 
controversial without being clearly 
understood. While the debate about 
fracking rages all across the country, 
the controversy, and the confusion, 
is most salient in our very own Penn-
sylvania, where it is seen simultane-
ously as an economic miracle and an 
environmental doom.
Fracking, short for hydraulic frac-
turing, is a process used to remove 
oil and natural gas from shale rock 
formations deep in the earth. Mil-
lions of gallons of water, sand, and 
chemicals are pumped underground 
to literally fracture the shale forma-
tion, releasing gas and ?uid to be ex-
tracted and used as energy.
This technique has become wildly 
popular in the United States, with 
nine out of ten gas wells using frack-
ing according to ProPublica. It has 
exponentially increased the amount 
of natural gas and oil produced in 
the United States, and propelled us 
by leaps and bounds toward energy 
independence. American oil produc-
tion had jumped 72 percent under 
the Obama administration by 2015, 
with the U.S. passing Saudi Arabia 
as the world’s largest oil producer by 
some measures according to CNN. 
Energy independence is nothing to 
sneeze at. Reliance on foreign oil 
makes us vulnerable in international 
negotiations and sends a lot of our 
money overseas in exchange for 
oil. Further, we often get caught in 
military and diplomatic quagmires 
when we feel our access to oil might 
become restricted. If this is less of a 
threat, the U.S. will have less need 
for its deadly and expensive involve-
ment in the Middle East. The Ameri-
can government will have more le-
verage in international negotiations 
when a basic necessity like energy is 
not a question mark.
Closer to home, fracking has revi-
talized the Pennsylvanian economy. 
Extraction from the Marcellus and 
Utica Shale Plays has made Pennsyl-
vania the second largest producer 
of natural gas in the nation, behind 
Texas. The Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Labor and Industry credits 
the drilling industry with employing 
nearly 90,000 people in the state. 
With the decline of the coal industry, 
Pennsylvania’s economy has been 
hurting, with the loss being dispro-
portionately felt by blue-collar work-
ers. The federal government has 
tried to lessen the blow by promoting 
the growth of the tech industry with 
tax incentives and a push to bring 
broadband to rural coal country, but 
the transition from mining to tech 
has been rocky. The lack of compa-
rable skills and need for extensive 
retraining leaves many mining com-
munities out in the cold. 
Fracking offers another possible 
replacement, one with a smoother 
transition. This potential for revital-
izing coal communities was best il-
lustrated in 2015 when Panda Power 
announced plans to build a new 
natural gas power plant at the site of 
the former Sunbury coal plant, that 
was shuttered in 2014, bringing jobs 
to a community that had lost its main 
economic driver.
The development of the fracking 
industry hasn’t been all sunshine and 
optimism, though. Environmental-
ists have voiced concerns about the 
effects of fracking, and the progress 
of the industry is littered with stories 
of nearby rural communities having 
their drinking water contaminated 
by fracking operations. In Pennsyl-
vania, the state’s Department of En-
vironmental Protection’s Oil and Gas 
Program has investigated over 2,800 
complaints regarding water, accord-
ing to The Huf?ngton Post. Some 
279 cases have been found to be di-
rectly tied to drilling activities. An-
other 500 cases are still open, some 
for years as the government ?oun-
ders to draw a conclusion.
The problem is that the link be-
tween fracking and environmental 
damage and contamination is less 
clear-cut than the videos of resi-
dents lighting their sink water on 
?re would lead you to believe. In 
2015, the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) released a report that 
asserted that fracking is not inher-
ently dangerous to drinking water, 
although spills and leaking wells can 
hurt local communities if not cor-
rectly handled. 
Environmentalist groups such as 
EcoWatch called the EPA’s conclu-
sion into question, citing the Public 
Herald’s discovery in June of 2016 of 
1,275 water-related complaints from 
Pennsylvania residents to the De-
partment of Environmental Protec-
tion that had been kept off the books 
and therefore out of the EPA’s inves-
tigation as evidence that the report 
underestimated the effect of fracking 
on water quality.
Currently, the only conclusion 
that can be drawn about the effect of 
fracking on the environment is that 
the jury is still out. But like every 
complicated issue that gets national 
attention, the lack of hard evidence 
hasn’t kept different politicians and 
interested groups from drawing 
their own conclusions and making 
demands. Environmentalists call for 
the suspension of all fracking op-
erations until a full assessment of 
their environmental impact. With 
the memory of how governmental 
environmental regulations enabled 
coal’s decline still fresh, workers at 
fracking operations in coal country 
are suspicious of government regu-
lations. Republicans tout America’s 
growing energy independence as the 
start of a new American Golden Age, 
while Democrats point to commu-
nities like Avella, PA, with it’s sand 
clogged pipes and foul, yellow water 
as examples of how fracking leaves 
communities behind. It’s a multi-
layered debate that is shaped by 
scienti?c confusion, political inter-
ests, and desperate economic need.
With the inconclusiveness and 
grey area of this topic, you may be 
wondering why we’re bringing it up 
at all. We’re talking about it because 
the future of fracking, for better or 
for worse, is irrevocably tied to the 
future of Pennsylvania, and it’s a 
future that will be at a crossroads 
this November. Senator Pat Toomey 
(PA-R) is up for reelection, facing Ka-
tie McGinty (D). With congressman 
Mike Doyle (D–PA) all of Pittsburgh’s 
representatives in the Pennsylvania 
General Assembly up for reelection 
running unopposed, this race is Pitts-
burgh voters’ only chance to shape 
the decisions around fracking in the 
upcoming years.
Toomey’s platform, according 
to his website, views the Marcellus 
Shale as an opportunity to “increase 
job creation, boost economic growth 
and provide more affordable energy 
for Pennsylvanians,” a goal that only 
considers the short-term bene?ts of 
extracting Pennsylvania’s natural gas 
reserves as opposed to the long-term 
detriments to our environment and 
lives. His voting record also shows 
a clear disdain for bodies like the 
EPA who attempt to regulate these 
processes to minimize impact and 
incentivize the switch to greener en-
ergy sources. While this may appeal 
to people relying on the economic 
boost of fracking, Toomey does not 
intend to protect Pennsylvania and 
its citizens from the possible adverse 
affects, and his penchant for deregu-
lation could make the potential for 
accidents and contamination worse.
McGinty’s platform shows more 
initiative, but not necessarily as 
much as we would like to expect 
from a candidate with a planned 
campus appearance alongside Ber-
nie Sanders. Her professional expe-
rience shows clear interest in envi-
ronmental issues (chair of the White 
House Council on Environmental 
Quality under President Clinton, 
Secretary of the Department of En-
vironmental Protection under Gov-
ernor Rendell), but her experience 
has rooted her goals in a sense of re-
alism. Her platform does not prom-
ise to end fracking in Pennsylvania, 
loosing her points with the left, but 
she intends to “support innovations 
in clean energy technologies and tax 
incentives that will level the playing 
?eld to move our country towards a 
clean energy future.” A slow transi-
tion to a future with more promise of 
green energy is preferable to the con-
scious choice to continue damaging 
our state, regardless of any scienti?c 
evidence.
In the end, nuance is key when 
dealing with an area with so many 
interests at play and so many shift-
ing variables. Whatever your politi-
cal leanings, it’s important to keep 
all the sides in mind on Election Day 
to make sure we don’t end up doing 
irreversible damage. And, above all, 
make sure you’re out there on Nov. 8 
to have a say in our state’s future.
CALEB GLICKMAN
As you all know, it is an election 
year. The media never fails to re-
mind us of this on an hourly basis. 
However, I would like to start this 
political column with a commen-
tary on a different subject than our 
current election. There is a good 
chance that you are going to dis-
agree with this article. You do not 
have to read it, but I sincerely hope 
you do. Whether or not you believe 
these opinions is beyond the point. 
I hope you may take some of these 
thoughts and discuss them with oth-
er people. When we shy away from 
civil discussion about issues, we let 
ourselves be governed by the loud-
est voices in the room, no matter 
how civil they are. I hope for this col-
umn to be a place that encourages 
people to have open debate about is-
sues, while keeping in mind that our 
country is an extremely heteroge-
neous place. We ?nd it easy to live in 
our own bubble and discount others’ 
opinions as unintelligent because 
they have had different upbringings. 
I hope to break down these assump-
tions and invigorate spirited debate, 
without encouraging fear or hatred 
of the other political side.
Now, the ?rst issue we will be 
tackling together is one that re-
ceived widespread criticism on both 
sides of the aisle: the two-party 
system.
Yes, I know, you probably just 
groaned. I would like to try to con-
vince you why the two-party system 
is bene?cial for America. George 
Washington himself warned against 
the partisanship of party politics. 
Why would I, in my ?rst column, 
challenge the words of our ?rst 
president? 
Well, that’s going to take a bit 
of explaining, so we will break it 
down into a few columns. We’ll start 
with an overview of American prec-
edents, then discuss the changes of 
the modern media. Third, we’ll ana-
lyze the shift of partisanship over 
the last few decades, and ?nally we 
will get to our current election or as 
it is known abroad, “America’s game 
of chicken with authoritarianism 
gone wrong.” This may seem like 
a lot, but I’m not even going to get 
started on defending our current 
political landscape or the Electoral 
College; these are things we will 
discuss thoroughly in other parts of 
this series. Now, I am going to make 
the case that the system of two par-
ties is the most bene?cial one for the 
country we live in. To do that, we are 
going to start at the very beginning: 
the Constitution.
The Constitution receives a lot 
of praise from our current politi-
cians. It is hailed as the all-seeing 
document of our Founders, and is 
the core gospel with which we have 
based our entire country since 1789, 
making only 27 edits. That is con-
siderably impressive, considering 
how many other liberal democracies 
change constitutions every so often. 
(I’m looking at you France.) But the 
Founding Fathers felt far more hesi-
tant about the Constitution than we 
would like to believe. The ?rst par-
tisan divide over the Constitution 
came over its adoption alone. This 
divide laid the foundation for nearly 
every single debate of our political 
leaders, the debate of a large federal 
government versus a small federal 
government.
Before adopting the Constitution 
we know today, the ?edgling U.S. 
government adopted the Articles of 
Confederation. If you don’t remem-
ber it from the chapter after the 
Revolutionary War chapter of your 
U.S. History textbook, here’s a quick 
refresher: the Articles let a unicam-
eral legislature with single votes for 
each state rule without an executive 
branch, there was no power to raise 
a national army or collect national 
taxes, and there was also no estab-
lished judiciary. If you were some-
one who was a champion of the 
states, it was an appropriate system 
with a few ?aws. If you were some-
one who wanted a stronger federal 
government, it was terrible.
To ensure the collective survival 
of a stronger union, some of our 
country’s founders wanted to edit 
the Articles; the summer of 1787 
saw the Constitutional Convention 
in Philadelphia. Instead of editing it, 
they tossed it and made something 
new. What followed was an explo-
sion of ideas from a congregation of 
enlightenment thinkers and fairly 
unrestrained limits as to what to de-
bate and how to organize a new gov-
ernment. We know what emerged at 
the other end of it: a comprehensive 
compromise by all the members 
of the convention appeasing both 
small and large states while keeping 
the geographic divides over slav-
ery at bay to ensure to survival of 
the union. Meanwhile, the federal 
government was given signi?cantly 
more power and superiority over 
state authority with the establish-
ment of a single executive and an 
equal judiciary.
This is an extremely brief summa-
ry, but the fact remains that the ?nal 
result of the Constitution was dissat-
isfying to nearly every single mem-
ber of the convention in some way. 
Many ideas of our glorious founders 
were shot down and remain in the 
hidden fabric of history; some of 
these ideas were, like the Articles of 
Confederation, terrible. As historian 
Ron Chernow accounts in his biogra-
phy of Alexander Hamilton, Benja-
min Franklin called for a unicameral 
legislature and executive council, 
Alexander Hamilton advocated for 
a president for life, and even James 
Madison, often hailed as the “Father 
of the Constitution,” was in favor of 
a federal government veto over state 
laws. Thomas Jefferson was even 
against the adoption of the Consti-
tution at all. The Founding Fathers 
achieved many great things, but it 
is important to remember that they 
were achieved usually at the ex-
pense of compromise of their ideas. 
The grand compromise that was the 
Constitution goes to show how com-
promise has endured as a main pillar 
of our political culture.
Through its rati?cation process, 
the ?rst partisan divisions of our 
country emerged with Federalists, 
who supported the Constitution and 
its increase in centralized power, 
and Antifederalists, who sought to 
protect states’ rights from what they 
saw as an encroachment of a dan-
gerous federal government. These 
two camps are the original divisions 
of our party system. Our party sys-
tem is innately a debate over the role

Parachutes: French. Crepes: 
French. Champagne: French. And 
now, religious persecution: French.
Europe is still in the throes of a dif-
?cult integration process of refugees. 
In light of recent terrorist attacks, 
France is even struggling to integrate 
Muslims who have lived their whole 
lives in France.
The most recent controversy is, 
unexpectedly, a debate over bathing 
suits. The popularity of the “burkini,” 
a garment designed to adhere to tra-
ditional Muslim standards of mod-
esty, appears to have sent the French 
administration into a panic over the 
“radical” tendencies of the bathing 
suits. 
Many coastal towns in France 
have banned the burkini in the name 
of public safety, and the French Prime 
Minister, Manuel Valls, has support-
ed them, calling the swimsuits “the 
enslavement of women.” A photo of 
a Muslim woman being forced to re-
move her clothing at the beach, sur-
rounded by armed police of?cers, 
has received popularity online for its 
depiction of the harsh crackdown on 
religious swimwear.
This type of infringement on per-
sonal liberty of wardrobe choice is 
unfortunately not new to France. 
In 2004, the government passed a 
law banning “ostentatious” religious 
symbols in schools, which included 
Christian crosses and Jewish skull-
caps, but was primarily aimed at the 
headscarf. And in 2010, burqas, or 
full-faced veils, were forbidden.
It is understandable that the 
French government is ?ghting a war 
on radical Islam, and has viewed the 
fashion trend as a manifestation of 
radical Islamic beliefs. Prime Min-
ister Valls believes the bans should 
be viewed as a support of women’s 
liberty. “In France, we consider that 
a woman who wants to swim should 
not remain in the shadows. That 
women cannot be the object of any 
domination. And there is certainly 
masculine domination when it is 
judged that a woman’s body should 
be removed from the public space.” 
This was published in a recent article 
he wrote, challenging a New York 
Times article that featured the voices 
of French Muslim women and their 
experiences of being persecuted for 
their religious clothing.
Yet while the Prime Minister, 
along with many French of?cials, 
may believe himself to be protecting 
the rights of women, the opposite 
is true. This creation of the burkini 
signi?es progress for the individual 
freedom of Muslim women. It al-
lows them to enjoy a day at the beach 
without compromising their religious 
beliefs, rather than sitting in the 
shadows or remaining at home.
There is also the very likely pos-
sibility that Muslim women choose 
to cover themselves in public out of 
devotion to God, as an outward ex-
pression of their inward modesty be-
fore others, and their purity of heart. 
A married Muslim woman may wear 
her robes and hijab as a sign of com-
mitment to her husband — her beau-
ty is reserved for him alone. In fact, 
the concept is remarkably similar 
to that of nuns in various Christian 
faiths — dedication of body, mind, 
and soul to God alone. But a French 
of?cial would never dream of regu-
lating the religious garments of Cath-
olic nuns at the beach.
The bans were implemented in 
the name of secularism — the belief 
that religion can only be practiced so 
long as it doesn’t impose its practices 
and beliefs on others. Apparently, a 
high school student with a cross is 
a religious imposition to their class-
mates, as is a woman in a tunic at the 
pool to other members of the public.
However, even a government has 
its own set of beliefs, and it is impera-
tive that that government doesn’t un-
wittingly impose those beliefs upon 
its citizens. It is remarkably danger-
ous when a government tries to leg-
islate religious beliefs, especially in 
such a diverse population. In fact, 
it is essential even to allow hate-
ful groups like the Westboro Baptist 
Church, known for picketing funer-
als and attacking army vet-
erans, to express their 
beliefs, because it’s 
the only way to 
ensure freedom 
of expression 
for all. The 
French may-
ors who im-
posed these 
bans may 
genuinely 
be trying to 
free Muslim 
women from 
male oppres-
sion, but they 
should still 
not be permit-
ted to impose 
their opinions 
on these women, 
especially with-
out considering 
the perspective 
of these Muslim 
women.
France has 
declared itself the protector of “mod-
ern Islam” — but what if the women 
in modern Islam want to cover up? 
If the burkini truly represents male 
domination over women’s wardrobe 
choice, then what has the French ad-
ministration done other than replace 
that former male domi-
nation with their 
own?

SYDNEY ROSLIN
On February 20, 1962, John 
Glenn made history when he became 
the ?rst American to orbit Earth. His 
name plastered headlines, his story 
was told across the country. Yet, his 
story is not his alone to tell. Behind 
the scenes, an entire agency was 
working to help Glenn return home 
safely, including Katherine Johnson, 
a African-American research math-
ematician for NASA who is one of 
the subjects of the upcoming biopic, 
Hidden Figures.
Hidden Figures focuses on 
the contributions that Johnson, 
along with her colleagues Dorothy 
Vaughan and Mary Jackson, made 
to America’s technological achieve-
ments during the space race. These 
women were members of a divi-
sion of NASA known as the West 
Area Computing unit, a group of 
female, black mathematicians that 
were segregated from the rest of the 
agency. The women were known as 
“computers” in the age before NASA 
used electronic computers, and were 
originally hired during World War II 
to ?ll in the gaps left by the soldiers 
overseas. However, NASA kept many 
of these women after the war.
In 1953, Johnson was moved to 
Langley Research Center’s Guidance 
and Navigation Department. A bril-
liant mathematician, Johnson was 
responsible for calculating the tra-
jectory of Alan Shepard’s spacecraft 
during the mission where he became 
the ?rst American in space.
By the time John Glenn’s mission 
was being put into practice, NASA 
was using electronic computers 
rather than mathematicians. How-
ever, Glenn requested that Johnson 
speci?cally recheck all of the calcu-
lations made by the electronic com-
puters. Her mathematic skills were 
critical during the Apollo Moon 
Landing Mission, as well as the start 
of the Space Shuttle program. John-
son has been awarded honorary 
doctorates, the 1967 NASA Lunar 
Orbiter Spacecraft and Operations 
team award, and even the Presiden-
tial Medal of Freedom, which she 
received from President Obama this 
past November.
In a time when black women in 
science were few and far between, 
Johnson carved out a place for her-
self in the scienti?c community. De-
spite the fact that she was hired to 
be a part of a cloistered unit of black 
women, a result the con?icts be-
tween laws that prohibited discrimi-
nation in the country’s defense in-
dustry and contradictory Jim Crow 
laws, Johnson was able to make her-
self seen not just as a member of her 
gender or race, but as a scientist in 
her own right.
However, few women, and even 
fewer black women, ever have the 
chance to prove themselves in sci-
enti?c ?elds. According to the Anita 
Borg Institute for Women and Tech-
nology, as of 2006, black women 
earned only 0.34 percent of PhDs 
in computer science and only 0.58 
percent of PhDs in engineering. 
In physics, only 14 black women 
received PhDs between 1973 and 
2012, compared to 22,172 white 
men, according to the National Sci-
ence Foundation.
For a long time, STEM ?elds have 
been a white man’s world. Many fe-
male scientists, and female African-
American scientists in particular, 
have talked about their experiences 
trying to break into this world, their 
frustration over not being taken as 
seriously as their male counterparts, 
and their feeling of being overlooked 
due to their gender or the color of 
their skin. Even today, women of-
ten ?nd that they have to prove 
themselves in order to be treated as 
equals in STEM ?elds.
These gaps can be traced all the 
way back to childhood. A 2011 study 
on math-gender stereotypes in el-
ementary school children reported 
that as early as the second grade, 
boys tend to associate math with 
their own gender while girls tend to 
associate math with boys. Girls have 
signi?cantly fewer scienti?c role 
models to look up to, since fewer 
female scientists have reached that 
point of prominence in their ?elds. 
Nola Hylton, a research scientist 
at the University of California, San 
Francisco, said in an interview with 
Mic.com that young black girls are 
often discouraged from pursuing 
sciences because there are very few 
people who look like them that are 
actively working in the ?eld.
Efforts are being made to ?x these 
gender and racial gaps. In schools 
across the country, programs are be-
ing instituted to encourage girls to 
get involved with STEM ?elds. More 
and more young women are enter-
ing college to pursue STEM degrees. 
However, there is still plenty of work 
to be done. At Carnegie Mellon, for 
example, about 30 percent of the un-
dergraduate students in the College 
of Engineering are female, which 
doesn’t sound very equal until you 
compare that statistic with the na-
tional average of 20 percent.
Perhaps the media is the way to 
show women that they belong in the 
STEM world. By highlighting and 
celebrating the women that have 
changed the face of science, such as 
Katherine Johnson, young girls can 
see that historical racism and sexism 
can be conquered. Through their 
stories, we can inspire a new genera-
tion of women that will change the 
world.

 TWO PARTY, from A8
of federal government. Any other 
party tends to either be regional, 
personal, or a single-issue party with 
transient in?uence that are eventu-
ally subsumed into the two main 
parties.
However, despite their clearcut 
opposition, these two main par-
ties are not meant to be zero-sum. 
George Washington warned against 
partisan politics, but he also was 
someone willing to ?nd compromis-
es. Having two moderately branded 
parties on both sides of the spectrum 
gave the country a way to make 
moderate changes and keep people 
happy after winning an election. 
This way, the majority of a populous 
can be satis?ed with the government 
they voted into of?ce. Our constitu-
tion would not be able to withstand 
the strains of loose party coalitions 
of a multi-party system because such 
parties would be focused on singular 
interests. Those can work in other 
countries with different govern-
ments; in the United States, a broad 
two-party system is the best option.
Our American experiment felt 
growing pains before ?nally settling 
on our two-party system. Antifed-
eralists evolved after Washington’s 
election into the Democratic-Re-
publicans lead by Thomas Jefferson. 
The Federalists, meanwhile, were 
extinguished by 1814 after loosing 
the White House in 1800, leaving 
the U.S. with an unbalanced politi-
cal landscape. The Whigs came into 
existence in 1833 to end the so-
called “Era of Good Feelings” in op-
position to the populist Democrat, 
Andrew Jackson. (Side-note: This is 
in quotations because just because 
one party was dominant, does not 
mean partisanship melted away. It 
was not much one of good feelings, 
and rather one of compromise, e.g. 
the Compromise of 1820.) Andrew 
Jackson, it should be noted, came to 
prominence after losing in 1824 in a 
four-party race that led to the “Cor-
rupt Bargain.” Since no candidate 
had a majority of electoral votes, 
Henry Clay threw his support behind 
John Quincy Adams in the House of 
Representatives in return for becom-
ing Secretary of State. If two moder-
ate options had been posed, this situ-
ation never would have risen. These 
Whigs, led by Henry Clay 
and David Webster were 
dedicated to opposing 
Jackson, creating the 
Second Party Sys-
tem. This party was 
also doomed, 
however, and 
fell apart after 
the Compro-
mise of 1850 
when the 
issue of 
slavery 
split the party. In 1854, the 
Kansas-Nebraska Act insti-
gated the formation of 
the Republican Party. 
Then came the elec-
tion of 1860.
In this 
?yby of 
American 
history, we 
are going 
to stop 
and make a note about this election 
in particular and the way it is framed 
by people from all parts of the politi-
cal spectrum. Republicans like to say 
how they were the party that ended 
slavery, except in the lens of our 
analysis, it is quite clear that ideo-
logically, the Republican Party of the 
1860s is much closer to the Demo-
cratic Party of today. Democrats are 
usually quick to remind them of this. 
Third Party candidates (like Gary 
Johnson, who we will talk at length 
about in the future, don’t worry) 
love to make the claim that Abe Lin-
coln was a third party candidate, so 
why not give our guy a chance? This 
however, is grossly inaccurate.
The facts remain that the Repub-
licans and Democrats ran candidates 
for president in the election of 1856, 
four years prior. James Buchanan 
won in a landslide, but two parties 
were clear. In 1860, Democrats split 
on regional lines. Stephen Douglas 
was the Northern Democrat and 
John C. Breckinridge was the South-
ern Democrat. It was the same ideo-
logical party, save for the slavery 
question. Lincoln won the north, 
Breckinridge won the south, and 
poor John C. Bell’s Constitutional 
Union Party won the border states, 
just looking to do what his party’s 
name said: keep a constitutional 
union. That was about it. Stephen 
Douglas was second in the popular 
vote, but third in the Electoral Col-
lege. Lincoln won the presidency 
with 39.8 percent of the vote. Demo-
crats had the popular advantage as a 
whole, but because their party had 
split in two, it handed Lincoln the 
election.
The point remains however, that 
Lincoln was not a “third party can-
didate,” as we treat them today. He 
ran in a four-party race, but he was 
clearly from one of the two ideologi-
cal sides of the aisle. Not to mention 
that this election didn’t quite end in 
a peaceful transfer of power. But for 
now, we must move onward!
So, the South loses and Repub-
licans experience a long stretch of 
wins, obviously. This runs until the 
Compromise of 1877, which is an-
other beautiful example of the ?aws 
of our Electoral College. But we’ll get 
back to that in a later episode.
Now we have our Republicans 
and Democrats from here on out. 
In column three, we will discuss the 
shifts of these two parties ideologi-
cally apart over the past 50 years, but 
I would like to tap one last example 
of American precedent in this ?rst 
chapter. We will move forwards to 
the Progressive Era.
The Election of 1912 saw the 
greatest “Third Party” candidacy 
as we think of them today. The Bull 
Moose Party, led by the rough and 
tumble Theodore Roosevelt, split off 
the Republican Howard Taft nomi-
nation to form their own party, al-
though ideologically similar. This 
rifted the Republicans straight down 
the middle, opening a hole for Wood-
row Wilson to win the election with 
41.8 percent. The Republican camp 
amassed a majority of popular vote, 
but due to the multiple parties run-
ning, a majority of people was dissat-
is?ed with the result of the election. 
From a democratic standpoint, that 
is insanity.
The perfect union that we strive 
for is de?nitely a long ways off. Still, 
our government has maintained one 
document as its core for over two 
centuries; the debate over its powers 
is the one main question with which 
our government has quarreled over. 
Given the system that our such-
beloved founders created, the most 
practical political system retains the 
same image of the Constitution’s 
inception: one of compromise. Two 
moderate sides of the political spec-
trum can act as umbrellas cover-
ing nearly all the population; when 
these parties are governed by those 
eager to continue moderate prog-
ress, compromises are more easily 
reached between these two sides. 
A multi-party system cannot be 
sustained due to the question over 
the adoption of the Constitution. 
And when a single executive is elect-
ed separately from the legislature, a 
multi-party race in this country runs 
the risk of electing a president with-
out full majority of support, which 
undermines the purpose of a ful?ll-
ing the desires of the people.
Next time on “Caleb Makes You 
Angry,” we will talk about how the 
media has shifted over the past 20 
years and its effect on our political 
ideologies. We will also begin our 
conversation on how our current 
two parties have ended up 
where they are today. 
With regard to our 
modern political is-
sues, I hope to propose 
some solutions to 
bring the partisan di-
vide together again 
in a two-party sys-
tem. Still, our current 
parties remain further apart 
ideologically than they have 
ever been before, save for 
maybe the 1860s. And 
we all know how well 
that decade went. 
So there is still 
much to discuss.

NFL teams begin the 2016 season ready to ?ght or falter
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Layout Manager
While the NFL no longer 
features the parity it once 
enjoyed, the short, 16-game 
schedule still produces some 
wild year to year changes in 
the standings based on luck 
and the rapid changes in NFL 
rosters. This exercise tends 
to go poorly, but here I’ll pre-
dict who will improve, who 
will tumble down the stand-
ings, and who will raise the 
Lombardi Trophy in February 
when it’s all said and done.
Team to improve: Oakland 
Raiders (7–9)
The Raiders 7–9 record 
last year accurately represent-
ed their level of play. The de-
fense was middle of the pack. 
Defensive end Khalil Mack 
put a lot of quarterbacks on 
the turf and disrupted plenty 
of plays. He also was a very 
good run stopper when the 
time came. However, the rest 
of the defense was only okay 
and the secondary occasion-
ally looked plain bad.  The 
offensive line was solid and 
kept a clean pocket, but quar-
terback Derek Carr lost 375 
yards to dropped passes and 
did not have a good check 
down option, limiting his 
ef?ciency. 
Running back Latavius 
Murray also struggled to de-
liver on a lot of preseason 
hype managing only an even 
four yards per carry as the 
pass-oriented line struggled 
to create holes for him. The 
team split their one-score 
games, going 5–5 and the 
turned the ball over about 
as many times as they forced 
turnovers, both very sustain-
able rates.
However, the Raiders off-
season and team construction 
provide a lot of reasons for 
optimism.
The Raiders were able to 
sign former Bengals safety 
Reggie Nelson, the exact kind 
of ballhawking safety that 
makes life easy on a second-
ary. Nelson’s ability to read 
the pass and close the gap 
between him and deep re-
ceivers gives the Raiders a 
safety blanket when teams try 
and go deep, freeing up cor-
nerbacks to play more press 
coverage and create contact 
before receivers can even get 
into their routes.
The secondary also im-
proved with the arrival of for-
mer Chiefs cornerback Sean 
Smith. Smith’s ability to lock 
down great receivers was con-
sistently on display in Kansas 
City last season, and quarter-
backs able to survive Mack’s 
destructive back?eld pres-
ence will have another tough 
obstacle when trying to hit 
their top receivers. We could 
see ?rst round pick Karl Jo-
seph start at the strong safety 
position towards the middle 
of the year, but he is currently 
not listed as the starter and 
the moves made in the sec-
ondary will improve this of-
fense with or without Joseph.
The arrival of linebacker 
Bruce Irvin from the Se-
ahawks also gives the Raiders 
a pass rushing complement to 
Mack who can also cover tight 
ends and make passing on this 
Raiders defense a nightmare.
On the offensive side of the 
football, the Raiders signed 
guard Kelechi Osemele away 
from the Ravens. Osemele 
is the best guard in the NFL 
and will give Murray plenty of 
room to run. If Murray can’t 
capitalize, expect rookie run-
ning back DeAndre Washing-
ton to take over. The Raiders 
are excited about Washington 
and Murray will be on a short 
leash with Osemele pancak-
ing defensive linemen.
An improved running 
game will help the Raiders 
create space and show us an-
other year of improvement 
from Carr — who already 
played very well last season 
— and second year receiver 
Amari Cooper who showed 
?ashes of dominance last 
year despite his high number 
of drops. Another year in the 
league will help Cooper grow 
out of that issue, and he and 
receiver 
Michael Crabtree should 
form one of the best wide re-
ceiver duos in the league for 
the second straight season.

The Tartan annual Fantasy Football league gets underway
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
Last fall, current Tartan 
publisher Sarah Gutekunst 
embarked on a journey to the 
foreign world of Fantasy Foot-
ball. Throughout the season, 
Sarah learned how football 
worked, cheered as her team 
won, cried when injuries 
struck her players down, and 
fell in love with Denver Bron-
cos kicker Brian McManus. 
Through it all, she chronicled 
her journey in articles for The 
Tartan, allowing readers to 
join her through every strug-
gle and triumph.
This year, members of The 
Tartan’s editorial staff have 
come together to form a Fan-
tasy Football league in the 
spirit of Sarah’s journey. On 
Friday, Sept. 2, the Tartan 
II league held its ?rst draft. 
The results show who was 
on their A-game, who were 
the fantasy rookies, and who 
screwed themselves because 
of autopick.
Team 1: Flaming Bears
Layout Manager and 
former sports editor Zeke 
Rosenberg is the favorite to 
win this league simply because 
he knows the most about 
sports and actually keeps up 
with sports. This was evident 
by his draft strategy.
Holding the ?rst pick over-
all, he went with the consensus 
number one pick: Pittsburgh 
Steelers wide receiver Antonio 
Brown. Brown has emerged as 
the league’s top receiver fol-
lowing the retirement of Cal-
vin Johnson, and is likely to 
lead fantasy wide receivers as 
well. Bolstering Zeke’s receiv-
ing corps are Jordy Nelson of 
the Green Bay Packers, Mike 
Evans of the Tampa Bay Buc-
caneers, and a secret weapon: 
Cleveland Browns wide out 
Josh Gordon, who has missed 
substantial time due to sus-
pensions but possesses the 
ability to be a top receiver.
Zeke also snagged Caro-
lina Panthers tight end Greg 
Olsen, one of the few reliably 
top producers for the position. 
Though his roster of running 
backs is questionable with 
DeMarco Murray new to the 
Tennessee Titans and Jeremy 
Langford still an uncertain 
commodity for the Chicago 
Bears, his quarterback posi-
tion is helmed by Phillip Riv-
ers of the San Diego Chargers, 
who has seen a resurgence as a 
top fantasy quarterback.
Overall, Zeke has a strong 
roster that is poised to get 
stronger as he hits waiver 
wire targets. It would be sur-
prising not to see him in the 
championship round.
Team 2: Extremely Dank 
Team
Sports editor Alex Wood 
knows the game of football 
inside and out. He wants win-
ners, and his roster has plenty 
of them. With the second over-
all pick, he decided to take 
fantasy’s best quarterback 
of 2015: Cam Newton of the 
Carolina Panthers. The dual 
threat Newton will generate 
plenty of points on the ground 
and through the air. He next 
picked Dallas Cowboys wide 
receiver Dez Bryant, and then 
next chose top ten fantasy run-
ning back Mark Ingram of the 
New Orleans Saints, who I had 
been eyeing but just missed 
out on.
After rounding out his 
starting receivers with T.Y. Hil-
ton of the Indianapolis Colts, 
he selected Thomas Rawls of 
the Seattle Seahawks, the heir 
apparent to Marshawn Lynch. 
He then chose top ten fantasy 
tight end Travis Kelce of the 
Kansas City Chiefs and then 
took the Seahawks defense. 
His next pick could potentially 
be the steal of the draft: Danny 
Woodhead of the Chargers, 
who ?nished as the third best 
running back overall last year. 
Rounding out his starters was 
Patriots kicker Stephen Gost-
kowski, the gold standard of 
fantasy kicking.
Alex’s starting team is 
highly talented and playoff 
bound, but his bench seems 
somewhat questionable. If he 
shores up his roster through 
the waiver wire or trades, he 
will certainly be a strong con-
tender for the championship.
Team 3: Lieutenant 
Doodle
Sarah makes her trium-
phant return to Fantasy Foot-
ball ... by being “too busy” to 
draft for any longer than two 
minute intervals. At third 
overall, she made the surpris-
ing decision to reach for Patri-
ots tight end Rob Gronkowski. 
It’s undeniable that Gronk is 
the top tight end, but the other 
talent available makes the 
move either bold or reckless. 
Some elements of last 
year’s team have returned 
for Sarah. Seahawks quar-
terback Russell Wilson, Jets 
running back Matt Forte, and 
the aforementioned McManus 
have all returned to her squad. 
Sarah also decided to take a 
risk on Panthers wide receiver 
Kelvin Benjamin, who missed 
last year due to injury. She 
may be onto something since 
he scored 21 points on Thurs-
day, strongly outperforming 
his ten point projection.
Sarah has the advantage 
of knowing more about foot-
ball than most members of the 
league. Whether or not that 
translates to success will de-
pend on many factors, but she 
seems to have a solid roster 
coming out of the gate.
Team 4: Dreamland 
Warriors
Honestly, I never ex-
pected to return to Fantasy 
Football. Two years ago, my 
team claimed victory over my 
friends from high school, and 
I was content to go out in a 
blaze of glory. Giving Sarah 
advice last season, however, 
rekindled my interest in the 
game, and when I was asked 
to be a part of the Tartan II 
league, I agreed for the sake of 
The Tartan.
At fourth overall, I was sur-
prised that New York Giants 
wide receiver Odell Beckham 
and Minnesota Vikings run-
ning back Adrian Peterson 
were still on the board. While I 
was tempted to grab Peterson 
and heed traditional fantasy 
advice, Beckham was a critical 
part of my championship team 
two years ago, so I grabbed 
him off the board. I overcom-
pensated for bucking tradition 
by selecting three running 
backs in a row: Doug Martin 
of the Buccaneers, LeSean Mc-
Coy of the Buffalo Bills, and 
Jamaal Charles of the Kansas 
City Chiefs. Soon, I reached for 
a quarterback, but it’s worth it 
to me as a New Orleans Saints 
fan to have Drew Brees.
I’d say my roster looks solid 
now, but it could still fall apart 
terribly if misfortune strikes.
Team 5: Masshole 
Knickerbockers
Lula Beresford’s entry into 
the world of Fantasy Football 
de?nitely started well as she 
got an excellent ?rst round 
steal: the aforementioned 
Peterson. Despite his negative 
off ?eld presence, Peterson 
is a phenomenal runner who 
should be a consistent source 
of points for her. Her wide re-
ceivers include Jacksonville 
Jaguar Allen Robinson, Bran-
don Marshall of the Jets, and 
Oakland Raider Amari Cooper 
at the top of the list.
Of note is that Lula made 
the ?rst two free agency se-
lections of the year. Since Pa-
triots quarterback Tom Brady 
is on Goodell-imposed exile, 
Lula added Bears quarterback 
Jay Cutler. Because Cincin-
nati Bengals tight end Tyler 
Eifert is injured, she added 
Colts tight end Dwayne Allen. 
Both should be serviceable re-
placements while she waits for 
those two players, but the hole 
might become too deep for her 
to recover from later in the 
season if the rest of her team 
isn’t up to snuff.
Still, Lula’s team is noth-
ing to scoff at, and it will 
be interesting to see how it 
evolves given how active Lula 
seems to be combing through 
available players.
Team 6: Pladdie Daddies
India Price’s entry into the 
world of Fantasy Football is a 
mixed bag. On the one hand, 
I loved her picking Bengals 
wide receiver A.J. Green in the 
?rst round, as he has proven to 
be extremely reliable in fanta-
sy. I liked her picking up Titans 
tight end Delanie Walker, and 
I can see why she would be-
lieve in Steelers running back 
Deangelo Williams.
On the other hand, some 
of her other choices seem very 
boom or bust. 
Giants quarterback Eli 
Manning may or may not ruin 
his passing performance with 
turnovers. Houston Texans 
running back Lamar Miller 
may make the transition to an-
other team or not.
Finally, there are some 
troubling signs of manage-
ment on her choice of defense 
and kicker. The Raiders de-
fense has not been known for 
quite some time to be a force 
either in reality or fantasy. In 
addition, she has not replaced 
Steelers kicker Shaun Suish-
am, whose questionable status 
for Monday night leaves her 
no cover if he doesn’t play.
India’s team may win 
greatly one week and lose hor-
ribly the next. It’s all up to how 
she manages the week to week 
changes. She can choose her 
own fate, but it will be tough 
to compete against the stron-
ger teams especially without 
experience.

SPORTS BRIEFS
Women’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s soccer team started their 
season with a 12–0 win at 
home over Franciscan Univer-
sity on Sept. 2. Nine different 
players scored for the Tartans. 
Junior forward Grant Wilmer 
began the scoring in the fourth 
minute. Shortly after, junior 
mid?elder Tori Iatarola scored 
a goal of her own. Senior for-
ward Megan Bartoshuk was 
the next to score, in the 14th 
minute. Sophomore forward 
Katja Brackelmanns-Puig 
scored her ?rst career goal in 
the 28th minute. One minute 
later, junior forward Sienna 
Stritter scored the ?fth goal of 
the game. The Tartans scored 
two goals in the 39th minute 
from sophomore forward Kai-
ly Bruch and ?rst-year forward 
Ryan Casey. Wilmer scored her 
second goal of the game 13 
seconds into the second half. 
Iatarola scored the ninth point 
for the Tartans in the 65th 
minute. First-year mid?elder 
Emery Noll recorded a goal in 
the 77th minute, while Casey 
scored her second of the game 
two minutes later. Junior for-
ward Haili Adams scored the 
?nal point for the Tartans in 
the 80th minute.
On Saturday, Sept. 3, the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s soc-
cer team fell at home to the 
ninth-ranked Thomas More 
College Saints. The Tartans fell 
2–1. The Saints scored ?rst, 
but the Tartans managed to 
equalize the game in the 52nd 
minute with a goal from junior 
defender Katie Strycharz. Four 
minutes later the Saints would 
score on a free kick, putting 
them up 2–1 over the Tartans 
for the ?nal score.
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s soccer team traveled to 
Christopher Newport Univer-
sity on Friday, Sept. 9, and fell 
2–1 to the Captains.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team opened their sea-
son on Thursday, Sept. 1 at 
home against Muskingum Uni-
versity. The Tartans defeated 
the Fighting Muskies 9–2. 
The Tartans scored ?rst in the 
15th minute with a goal from 
?rst-year Elliot Cohen. In the 
28th minute, junior mid?elder 
Jimmy Jameson rebounded a 
shot off the opposing keeper 
to put the Tartans up 2–1. The 
third score for the Tartans 
came from sophomore Zack 
Masciopinto in the 40th min-
ute. The Tartans held a 3–0 
lead until the 60th minute, 
when ?rst-year John Painter 
scored the fourth point for the 
Tartans. 12 minutes later the 
Tartans scored again as senior 
forward Devin Keane headed 
a pass into the goal to put the 
Tartans up 5–0. Sophomore 
forward Anthony Gulli added 
to the Tartan lead in the 75th 
minute, and four minutes later 
?rst-year mid?elder Cooper 
Tubiana put the Tartans up 
7–0. The Fighting Muskies 
broke their scoring drought in 
the 81st minute, but the Tar-
tans answered as junior for-
ward Harry Landis scored his 
?rst career goal three minutes 
later to make the score 8–1. 
Muskingum scored their sec-
ond and ?nal goal of the game 
in the 85th minute. The ?nal 
score for the Tartans came in 
the 87th minute from ?rst-
year forward Nicolas Poveda 
to end the game with a 9–2 
victory.
On Saturday, Sept. 3, the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s soc-
cer team visited the University 
of Mount Union in Alliance, 
Ohio. The Tartans were victo-
rious with a 1–0 score and the 
win was also the 200th career 
victory for Tartan head coach 
Brandon Bowman. The only 
goal of the game came in the 
42nd minute when Masciopin-
to scored on a penalty kick. 
First-year goalkeeper Jack 
Sampiere made crucial saves 
in the 63rd and 71st minutes 
to keep the Purple Raiders 
from tying the game. Mount 
Union could not convert any 
scoring opportunities, and the 
game ended 1–0.

Team to stumble: Denver 
Broncos (11–5)
Last year, the Broncos be-
came the worst team to ever 
win the Super Bowl. Football 
Outsider’s Defense-adjusted 
Value Over Average (DVOA) 
ranked them 8th overall and 
even that feels a bit high. The 
Broncos’ Pythagorean win ex-
pectation, a predicted number 
of wins based on the number 
of points scored by and against 
Denver, was 8.7, indicating 
that they were closer to an av-
erage team than the top seed 
in the AFC. They then won 
two squeakers in the playoffs 
before trampling the Panthers 
in Super Bowl 50. Further, the 
Broncos went a completely un-
sustainable 9–3 in one-score 
games. That number moves up 
to 11–3 if you include the play-
offs. The Broncos started this 
season on a similar note, get-
ting away with four helmet-to-
helmet hits on Panthers quar-
terback Cam Newton and still 
needing Panthers kicker Gra-
ham Gano to shank a game-
winning ?eld goal wide left.
Teams tend to regress 
towards .500 in one-score 
games, so that alone would 
portend some slide in the 
Broncos record, however, the 
Broncos offseason carries 
even more bad news.
The most obvious hole for 
the Broncos is quarterback, 
but Peyton Manning, who is 
now retired, and Brock Oswei-
ler, who is now a Texan, com-
bined to be pretty useless last 
season, so the combination 
of Trevor Siemian and rookie 
Paxton Lynch can’t possibly 
be much worse than last year. 
The drop off comes in other 
positions.
The loss of both lineback-
ers Danny Trevathan and 
Malik Jackson dismantled 
the dominant Broncos mid-
dle linebacker pair from last 
year. Jackson in particular 
was probably the most un-
derrated player in the NFL 
and was a destructive force 
in both the run and the pass, 
using his rare combination of 
speed and strength to get to 
holes created by the offensive 
line and then plug them. The 
Broncos missed both of them 
on Thursday. Despite their 
win, the Broncos looked use-
less against Carolina’s rushing 
attack, only succeeding when 
their offense gave them a lead 
and forced Carolina to pass.
Running back CJ Ander-
son might have a great season 
and replicate his performance 
from Thursday night a few 
times, but if the Broncos’ of-
fense is that reliant on one 
player, there will be games 
when they can’t build a lead 
and teams will run right up the 
middle. That could be a very 
successful strategy against 
these Broncos.
Team that will win the Su-
per Bowl: Pittsburgh Steel-
ers (10–6)
The Steelers have the best 
offense in the NFL, and it’s not 
very close. The right side of the 
Steeler’s line is a destructive 
force, putting defenders on 
the ground and leaving tons of 
room for the Steelers talented 
back?eld to work their magic. 
Center Maurkice Pouncey and 
right guard David DeCastro 
keep the a-gaps very clean for 
Steelers runners. The left side 
of the line is not quite as good 
and will miss left tackle Kelvin 
Beachum who left for the Jag-
uars, but it’s still solid.
Missing running back 
Le’Veon Bell for three games 
will hurt the offense, but run-
ning back DeAngelo Williams 
was very productive replacing 
Bell as Bell missed most of last 
season and should continue to 
succeed in that role.
Steelers quarterback Ben 
Roethlisberger has been an 
excellent quarterback for 
years, extending plays with 
his footwork and hitting re-
ceivers at all levels of the ?eld. 
The fact that he now gets to 
throw to Antonio Brown — 
the best wide receiver in the 
league — is why the Steelers 
have ?nished in the top three 
in offensive DVOA each of the 
last two seasons. Losing wide 
receiver Martavis Bryant for 
a full season is not good, but 
wide receiver Markus Whea-
ton should capably replace 
Bryant.
Offensive production also 
tends to be stable. A team can 
alter their game plan much 
more reliably to ?ll in for lost 
offensive talent since they 
control where the ball goes 
on any given play. This means 
the Steelers offense isn’t likely 
to crater without an obvious 
cause like some defenses do.
The Steelers’ defense has 
been their weak point for the 
past several years and it could 
stay that way this year, but 
there are reasons to believe 
the Steelers can improve. 
Their defense is very young 
and stocked with promising 
players who can take this team 
from an average defense to a 
solid defense if they continue 
their current development.
Linebackers Jarvis Jones 
and Ryan Shazier have shown 
they have the talent to be great 
NFL linebackers since they 
were drafted in 2013 and 2014, 
respectively. They should both 
continue to improve and, com-
bined with linebacker Law-
rence Timmons, could become 
one of the better lineback-
ing groups in the NFL. That’s 
also assuming linebacker Bud 
Dupree will not come back 
this season. He’s currently ex-
pected to miss eight games, 
and if he is able to take over 
for Arthur Moats towards the 
end of the season, the Steel-
ers could have some of the 
scariest blitz packages in the 
league. All four of those line-
backers are capable rushing 
the passer, covering, and stop-
ping the run, making the de-
fense very versatile. Defensive 
end Cameron Heyward should 
continue to be an excellent 
pass rusher and rookie defen-
sive tackle Javon Hargrave has 
shown both the explosiveness 
and quick hands required to 
get past interior linemen in 
the NFL and also play at many 
spots along the defensive line. 
Hargrave adds to the collec-
tion of talent that could make 
this Steelers front seven scary. 
The Steelers capably 
stopped the run last season, 
but this year they could have 
a pass rush we haven’t seen 
from them in years.
The secondary is still 
very weak and this defense 
won’t be among the best in 
the league, but if it can be in 
the second tier, this offense 
should be good enough to pro-
pel the Steelers to a 7th NFL 
championship, which would 
be the most in the NFL.
2016 season begins with high expectations for NFL teams

Team 7: Mr Rogers’ 
Neighborhood
Jade, your pun is clever, but 
it doesn’t work unless you add 
the “d” for Packers quarter-
back Aaron Rodgers. Anyways, 
she seems bullish on Cowboys 
rookie running back Ezekiel El-
liott, who has the potential to 
be rookie of the year.
Her starters seem very solid, 
with the likes of Broncos wide 
receiver Demaryius Thomas, 
Cowboys tight end Jason Wit-
ten, and the Panthers defense. 
Her bench may only have 
a few notable names, but she 
may be geared up for the ?rst 
waiver wire.
Surprisingly strong for a 
rookie team. We’ll see what 
happens in the next few weeks.
Team 8: Team Tayal
Team Tayal begins pure au-
topick teams. Autopick granted 
Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal 
Atlanta Falcons wide receiver 
Julio Jones, Washington Red-
skins tight end Jordan Reed, 
Steelers running back Le’Veon 
Bell, and the Chiefs defense.
The rest of his roster is 
bare bones, and the fact that 
he hasn’t set a running back 
in place of the suspended Bell 
suggests he will not take this 
league seriously.
This team will likely fall 
apart unless Abhishek starts 
paying attention.
Team 9: Team Foley
Forum editor Sinead Foley’s 
?rst autopick generated team 
is actually really darn good. 
Falcons running back Devonta 
Freeman was last year’s sur-
prise top rusher in fantasy. 
Arizona Cardinals quarter-
back Carson Palmer has had 
a renaissance with the team, 
and Los Angeles Rams run-
ning back Todd Gurley looks 
to contribute to the team as 
well. Her wide receivers are of 
good quality: Sammy Watkins 
of the Bills, Jeremy Maclin of 
the Chiefs, and John Brown of 
the Cardinals are all worthy 
talents.
If she decides to take control 
of this team, Sinead might sur-
prise the rest of the league.
Team 10: Team Foley 
(again)
Apparently, Sinead decided 
to helm two teams in the league 
and promptly forgot about it. 
Cardinals running back David 
Johnson, Texans wide receiver 
DeAndre Hopkins, Chargers 
tight end Antonio Gates, and 
Jaguars quarterback Blake 
Bortles are the only notable 
performers from last year. 
Colts quarterback Andrew 
Luck will likely rebound from 
last year, but the rest of her 
roster is bleak and will likely 
degenerate over time.

Tartan football falls to conference rival in a heartbreaker
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon football 
team opened up their season 
against Washington University 
in St. Louis on Saturday. In a 
hard-fought matchup, the Tar-
tans fell to the Bears 41–34 in 
overtime, falling to 0–1 overall 
and in University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) standings.
The Tartan offense took the 
?eld ?rst. After going three 
and out, a 54-yard punt by ju-
nior punter and kicker Tyler 
Kohman put the defense in a 
good position. The Bears tried 
to pick up the pace by going no-
huddle, but the Tartan defense 
stopped them in their tracks. 
After taking a delay of game 
penalty, junior quarterback 
Bryan Jangro nearly made the 
?rst down himself on a scram-
ble, but fell just short of the ?rst 
down. After two great stops by 
the Tartans, Washington Uni-
versity accelerated, getting two 
quick ?rst downs before senior 
safety Malcolm Guya stopped 
their progress with an inter-
ception, setting up the Tartan 
offense with great ?eld posi-
tion. After two plays of noth-
ing for the offense, junior wide 
receiver John Prather hauled in 
a pass for the Tartans’ ?rst ?rst 
down of the day, and junior 
running back Sam Benger took 
advantage of the momentum, 
running all the way to the end 
zone and putting the Tartans 
up 7–0.
On the next drive, the Tar-
tan defense once again shut 
down Washington University. 
Benger made a few ?rst down 
runs, as the Tartan offense 
dominated the line of scrim-
mage. On third down, senior 
wide receiver Matt Forjan 
made a diving catch for a criti-
cal ?rst down conversion, al-
lowing Prather to haul in the 
next pass for a touchdown, 
going up 14–0. The Tartan de-
fense once again pressured the 
Bear offense, and junior inside 
linebacker Sean Graff made an 
interception deep in Washing-
ton’s territory. Benger brought 
the Tartans to the goal line be-
fore taking it in himself after 
a few more plays, putting the 
Tartans up 21–0. Washington 
University caught a break as 
the ensuing kickoff went out 
of bounds, giving the Bears the 
ball at their 35–yard line, but 
the defense once again shut 
them down.
In the second quarter, 
Washington got the ball back 
quickly, and went to work at 
trying to cut the Tartan lead 
down. The Bears made a deep 
pass, getting into Tartan terri-
tory, and another pass quickly 
brought them to the goal line. 
Offsetting penalties removed a 
touchdown pass for Washing-
ton, forcing them to settle for a 
?eld goal and cutting the Tar-
tan lead to 21–3. On the next 
drive for the Tartans, Jangro 
completed a deep pass to get to 
Washington’s side of the ?eld, 
but the Tartans were unable to 
go much further. The Bears be-
gan approaching with a more 
tempered offense, running the 
ball for decent chunks of yard-
age. Still, Washington tried for 
some deep passes after running 
out of patience, and the Tartan 
defense was able to cover well. 
The Bears once again caught a 
break as the Tartans fumbled 
on their next possession, and 
Washington went deep for a 
touchdown, making the score 
21–10.
The Tartans went back to 
work, with Benger giving the 
Tartans a bit of breathing room 
after a poor kickoff return. A 
pass from Jangro got the Tar-
tans to the other side of the 
?eld, but a tripping penalty 
on the next pass put an end to 
the drive. Kohman pinned the 
Bears within their 10–yard 
line, and the Tartan defense 
was able to keep them from 
gaining much traction. Jangro 
gave the ball back to the Bears 
on his next pass. Washington 
marched down the ?eld toward 
the goal line, but the Tartans 
forced the Bears to settle for a 
?eld goal as the 21–13 score 
turned the early blowout into 
a one possession game. At the 
end of the half, the Tartans 
hurried to the other side of the 
?eld, managing to give Kohm-
an a chance to make a ?eld 
goal. The kick sailed right of 
the post, and the Tartans went 
into halftime with the 21–13 
lead.
The start of the second half 
went fantastic for Washing-
ton University. A 78-yard run 
got them a touchdown early, 
bringing the game to a slim 
21–20 Tartan advantage. The 
next drive saw the Tartan of-
fense picking up the pace, with 
Prather taking the Tartans to 
the Bears’ side of the ?eld, but 
Jangro once again threw an in-
terception after his pass missed 
his receiver’s hands. The de-
fense bailed the offense out of 
the dif?cult position, allowing 
the offense to get the ball back 
with the lead. This time, the 
Tartans relied more on running 
to drive down the ?eld, getting 
to the goal line with only one 
pass on the drive. The Tartans 
made a ?eld goal, pushing 
their lead to 24–20. The Bears 
then proceeded to march down 
the ?eld, scoring a touchdown 
and taking their ?rst lead of the 
game at 26–24. The Tartan of-
fense ?zzled on their next pos-
session, but the Tartan defense 
got the ball back quickly. The 
Tartans made it to the other 
side of the ?eld before the third 
quarter ended.
The start of the ?nal quarter 
saw the Tartans fail to convert 
on third down, but a penalty 
for roughing the kicker gave 
the offense another shot. Jan-
gro scrambled to bring the 
Tartans to the red zone, and 
Benger kept pushing through 
Washington’s defense before 
?nally getting the touchdown 
to take back the lead at 31–26. 
The Bears marched back to the 
Tartans’ side of the ?eld, but 
Guya got his second intercep-
tion of the day. The Tartans 
began to wind the clock down, 
with Benger helping the Tar-
tans take a good amount of 
time off the clock. Senior kick-
er Gabe Renna got the Tartans 
up 34–24 with 3:35 left to play.
The Bears once again got 
great ?eld position after a 
kickoff out of bounds, but the 
Tartan defense came up with 
another stop. Though the Tar-
tans went three and out, they 
forced Washington to burn all 
their timeouts. 
The Bears’ ?nal drive saw 
the Tartans aggressively go af-
ter the quarterback, generating 
incomplete passes but allow-
ing Washington to drive close 
to the Tartan goal line. The 
Tartans had chances to ?nish 
the Bears off, but Washington 
scored the touchdown and 
two-point conversion, forcing 
overtime at 34–34.
Though the Tartans won 
the toss, they allowed the 
Bears to take the football ?rst. 
The Bears scored another 
touchdown bringing the game 
to 41–34. On the Tartans’ turn, 
Jangro completed a pass to 
Prather to get a ?rst down, and 
Benger brought them close to 
the goal. On a scramble, Jangro 
took a heavy hit and was forced 
to leave the game. With Jangro 
out, everything depended on 
Benger’s running ability, but 
the junior wound up one yard 
short of converting a fourth 
down, and the door closed on 
the Tartans’ season opener.
The close loss is tough to 
swallow. The Tartans out-
played the Bears for quite a 
long time. They ran up the 
score early, and showed a great 
ability to milk time off the clock 
as the game headed toward the 
end. Benger became the sec-
ond best rusher in Tartan his-
tory, his career yardage now 
behind just one other player. 
The defense was phenomenal 
at stopping the team that had 
trounced them 45–24 one year 
earlier.
Still, the mistakes made 
throughout the game added 
up. On three separate occa-
sions, the Tartans tried to re-
turn kickoffs instead of take 
touchbacks at the 25–yard line, 
losing seven to eight yards of 
?eld position each time. Mak-
ing the ?eld goal at the end of 
the second half could have pre-
vented the Bears from being in 
a position to tie the game with 
only one score. The turnovers 
provided Washington with 
much needed momentum as 
they were trying to claw their 
way back into the game. These 
mistakes could prove to be 
even costlier in future games if 
they persist.
The Tartans, however, re-
main a resilient team. Last 
year, they overcame a 1–3 start 
to win their last seven games. 
They have the capability of 
turning things around quickly, 
especially with Benger con-
tinuing to perform well for the 
team.
The Tartans will next 
play against Waynesburg on 
Saturday, Sept. 17.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team took the ?eld at 
home on Saturday against 
Frostburg State University in 
the Carnegie Mellon Universi-
ty DoubleTree Showcase. The 
Tartans took the match in an 
exciting 1–0 overtime victory.
The game was an even 
matchup for most of regula-
tion time, although the Tar-
tans played with a man ad-
vantage after the Bobcats were 
given a red card. This man ad-
vantage only lasted fourteen 
minutes, however, because 
the Tartans were handed a red 
card of their own. 
The teams spent almost 
35 minutes of regulation time 
with only ten men. Despite 
the man advantage that the 
Tartans carried until the red 
card, they could only ?nd one 
scoring opportunity when 
sophomore mid?elder Zack 
Masciopinto headed a shot 
toward the goal, but it was de-
?ected and ended up wide of 
the goalpost.
Before the teams had to 
play with a man out of the 
game, ?rst-year mid?elder 
Cooper Tubiana tried his 
hand at getting the Tartans a 
lead. He made back-to-back 
shots on goal in the 21st min-
ute, but neither attempt was 
successful. 
The Bobcats found just 
as much success in scoring 
as the Tartans did, and only 
saw a glimmer of hope in the 
65th minute when a free kick 
nearly made it into the Tartan 
goal but ricocheted off the 
goalpost instead.
The game remained even 
at zero goals until there was 
49 seconds left to play in over-
time. A foul was called against 
Frostburg, and Carnegie Mel-
lon was given a free kick from 
35 yards away from the goal. 
Sophomore mid?elder Philip 
Petrakian played the kick to the 
far goalpost, and Tubiana leapt 
into the air over every other 
player and headed the ball into 
the Frostburg goal, ending the 
game with a 1–0 victory for 
the Tartans as they gathered 
on the ?eld in celebration. 
Sophomore goalkeeper Alec 
Lam earned his ?rst shutout 
of the season as well as his sec-
ond win with three saves on 
the day. 
With this victory, the Tar-
tans improve to 3–0 on the 
season while the Bobcats fall 
to 1–3.
Men’s soccer undefeated after tough overtime victory
Women’s soccer holds on for double overtime victory
ALEX WOOD

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team trav-
eled to Christopher Newport 
University on Saturday, Sept. 
10 to compete in the Captains 
Classic. The Tartans competed 
against the Virginia Wesleyan 
College Marlins and were vic-
torious in the double overtime 
contest with a score of 2–1.
Virginia Wesleyan struck 
?rst in this contest when in the 
29th minute a Marlin player 
snuck the ball past junior goal-
keeper Sarah Mahler to give 
Virginia Wesleyan a 1–0 lead. 
Carnegie Mellon eventu-
ally answered in the 40th min-
ute, but not without a ?ght 
from the Marlins. It began 
as ?rst-year forward Vayda 
Farino took a hard shot at 
the Marlin goal, but the goal-
keeper made a diving save to 
de?ect it. On the following 
corner kick, sophomore for-
ward Katja Bracklemanns-
Puig made back-to-back shots 
on goal, the second of which 
would be rebounded by soph-
omore forward Kaily Bruch 
into the Marlin goal for the 
score to tie the game at 1–1.
Through the rest of the 
game and all the way into 
the second overtime period, 
the Tartans appeared to have 
control on the ?eld, but could 
not score another goal to close 
out the match. That was until 
30 seconds remained in the 
second overtime period, when 
junior mid?elder Tori Iatarola 
took a corner kick that was 
headed by junior forward Si-
enna Stritter. Her header fell 
at the feet of junior forward 
Haili Adams, and Adams 
launched the ball at the back 
of the net with a strong kick, 
ending the game 2–1 in favor 
of the Tartans.
The Tartans improve to 2–2 
on the season, which means 
they already have as many 
losses in four games as they 
did over the entirety of last 
season. This could be a point 
of concern for the team, but it 
is still too early in the season 
to  tell. 
Their opponents so far 
have not been easy, and the 
majority of the season is ahead 
of them to capitalize on the 
momentum of this win and 
roll into the rest of the season 
with the con?dence to win. 
Almost  every game this 
season has ended with a score 
of 2–1, win or lose. The Tar-
tans are playing every oppo-
nent closely and have plenty 
of talent.
The Tartan women will 
compete again on Wednesday, 
Sept. 14, as they take on the 
Presidents of Washington and 
Jefferson College at home. 
The game is scheduled to start 
at 7 p.m.

EOC and BOC return as EncompassCMU; TOC eliminates nametags
CLAIRE GIANAKAS
Editor-in-Chief
Career fairs are an impor-
tant step in the job search pro-
cess, providing students with 
the chance to interact with 
companies and employers in 
the hopes of attaining an in-
ternship or full-time employ-
ment. In the next two weeks, 
Carnegie Mellon students will 
have the opportunity to at-
tend two major career fairs on 
campus — EncompassCMU 
and the Technical Opportuni-
ties Conference (TOC). Both 
of these career fairs will give 
students the opportunity to 
network with employers and 
explore their career options.
As always, the Career and 
Professional Development 
Center (CPDC) has a variety 
of resources to help students 
prepare for EncompassCMU 
and the TOC. CPDC Drop-In 
hours are Monday through 
Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m. Drop-In hours allow 
students to meet for 15 min-
utes with a career counselor 
in the CPDC Advising Center, 
located on the second ?oor 
of West Wing. The CPDC is 
also holding a résumé blitz in 
the CPDC Advising Center on 
Monday, Sept. 12 and Friday, 
Sept. 16 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
This program allows students 
to meet with a career coun-
selor for 15 minutes to review 
a hard copy of their résumé 
or to practice their elevator 
pitch. No appointment is nec-
essary for either event.
EncompassCMU
EncompassCMU, which 
will be held in the Cohon Cen-
ter in Wiegand Gymnasium on 
Sept. 13 from 10 a.m. to 4:45 
p.m., is new this year. Hosted 
by the CPDC, the fair will com-
bine two career fairs that were 
held in previous years — the 
Employment Opportunities 
Conference (EOC) and the 
Business Opportunities Con-
ference (BOC). By combining 
these two fairs, the CPDC has 
created a career fair that will 
offer jobs and internships to 
students of all majors and class 
years.
In an email to the student 
body, the CPDC highlighted 
the diversity of the career fair, 
noting that the fair will “bring 
together arts, business, com-
puter science, engineering, hu-
manities, and science students 
in one location,” and that 
“employers from all industries 
looking to ?ll numerous and 
varied roles are encouraged 
to attend.” Speci?cally, the 
CPDC noted that “over seventy 
employers have registered” 
who represent “a multitude of 
industries from ?nance to non-
pro?t to technology and every-
thing in between.”
EncompassCMU will be 
split into two sections. The 
?rst, from 10 a.m. to 12:45 
p.m., will be reserved for stu-
dents who are looking for in-
ternship opportunities. The 
second, from 2 p.m. to 4:45 
p.m., will be reserved for stu-
dents seeking full-time em-
ployment. Although these 
times are split between intern-
ship and full-time opportuni-
ties, students are welcome to 
attend either session if their 
schedules con?ict with their 
designated section. 
Students must have their 
Carnegie Mellon student ID to 
enter the fair and are not al-
lowed to bring coats or back-
packs into the gymnasium. A 
coat and backpack check will 
be provided in Peter, Wright 
and McKenna.
Technical Opportunities 
Conference (TOC)
The TOC will be held in 
the Cohon University Center 
in Wiegand Gymnasium and 
Rangos Ballroom on Sept. 
19-21 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
each day. The event, which is 
sponsored by the College of 
Engineering and organized by 
the Carnegie Mellon Society 
of Women Engineers (SWE), 
offers internship and full-time 
job opportunities for technical 
majors as well as traditional 
engineering and basic science 
majors.
There are several changes 
to the TOC this year, most no-
tably the lack of name tags. 
In previous years, name tags 
were required for entry into 
the TOC. Students who pre-
registered for the event online 
were provided printed name 
tags on the day of the event, 
while students who did non 
pre-register were required to 
handwrite a name tag each 
day. This year, name tags are 
not required for entry and will 
not be provided for pre-regis-
tered students.
Organizers believe that this 
change will help the TOC run 
more smoothly and be more 
environmentally friendly. 
“Many [name tags] were put 
to waste due to students’ fail-
ure to pick up their name tag,” 
said Anna Bandecca, a senior 
chemical and biomedical en-
gineering double major and 
one of the two TOC directors 
along with Alex Cerny, also a 
senior chemical and biomedi-
cal engineering double major. 
“With several thousand stu-
dents attending throughout 
the TOC, this created a lot of 
excess waste again, as well as 
excess confusion and lengthy 
lines that congests the TOC 
entrance. We are constantly 
trying to improve the entry 
process to the TOC, allowing 
students to have more time 
with recruiters, so we think 
this change will help.”
Like EncompassCMU, the 
TOC will be split into two sec-
tions each day, the ?rst from 
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. for internship 
opportunities, the second from 
2 p.m. to 5 p.m. for full-time po-
sitions. The TOC will be closed 
for lunch from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. 
There will be no admittance 
into the TOC after 12:45 p.m. 
for the lunch break and after 
4:45 p.m. for the end of the day.
While the TOC will be open 
the same times each day, the 
majors being recruited will 
vary. Sept. 19 will host compa-
nies interested in all technical 
majors, while employers pres-
ent on Sept. 20 will recruit 
students in computer science, 
electrical and computer engi-
neering, and other computer/
IT majors. The third day, Sept. 
21, will be open to non com-
puter/IT majors including, but 
not limited to, biology, bio-
medical engineering, chemi-
cal engineering, and mechani-
cal engineering.
As with EncompassCMU 
students must have their stu-
dent IDs to enter the fair and 
will be required to check any 
coats/bags in baggage check, 
which will be located in the 
Activities Room on the second 
?oor of the Cohon Center.
“We are constantly trying to 
improve the entry process to the 
TOC, allowing students to have 
more time with recruiters”

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
on bare feet and adaptability
Dear Sarah,
Something I’ve become familiar with is the distressing 
amount of bare feet that I’ve seen all over campus.
Recently during one of my classes in a lecture hall, this 
guy sat down right next to me and put his bare feet up 
on the seat in front of us. No matter how hard I tried to 
focus on the lecture and taking notes, all I could think 
about were his feet. He had yucky yellow toenails that 
hadn’t been trimmed for weeks, and with his hairy toes 
all spread apart on the chair’s hard back, I could see all 
of the toe cheese.
And this is just one of many instances. I see people 
with their dirty toes up on study tables, walking across 
the Pausch bridge, waiting for the elevator. Doesn’t it 
hurt to walk around on all kinds of surfaces without the 
protection of footwear? How much dirt do they have to 
scrape off in the shower? 
This widespread insistence on barefootedness is just 
too much for me to understand, let alone accept. Is 
there something we can do about this? 
Sincerely,
Feeling Overtly Obnoxiously Terrorized Finding Really 
Egregious Toe Showing Shoeless Hooligans
Dear FOOTFRETISH
Here at Carnegie Mellon, we have an assortment of 
people unlike any other in the world. We usually apply 
this diversity to geography, but it’s also important 
to consider the diversity of personalities, opinions, 
lifestyles, and ideologies. There are going to be times 
when you come in contact with people that you will 
just never agree with, and that can be a frustrating but 
important experience. The guy in your class and the 
countless other barefooted oddballs are part of that 
experience. It’s his right to choose whether or not to 
wear shoes, and your discomfort doesn’t change that. 
But it is your right to sit somewhere else.
It’s easy to walk around ignoring everything that 
makes you uncomfortable. But what will that teach 
you? How will you grow? The real challenge is to 
embrace what is foreign to you, understand it, and 
accept it. This is one of the most important gifts 
Carnegie Mellon can offer us. If it really super grosses 
you out, then maybe this isn’t your opportunity for 
growth and you should just try to focus on your 
lecture. But walk around campus with a spirit of open-
mindedness that will help you to understand other 
points of view.
Lovingly,
Sarah

Sarah Gutekunst | PublisherDon’t Breathe: Movie Review
 Don’t Breathe delivers on conventional horror movie tropes while offering some surprises
I’ve only recently come to tolerate horror as a 
genre. For 90 percent of my life, I found scary 
movies physically repellent.
For example, as a peer-pressured pre-teen forced 
to watch slasher classic I Know What You Did Last 
Summer, I tried to throw my hands to my face to 
cover my eyes, except that I was eating a muffin on 
my mom’s nice Pfalzgraff plate. I chipped my tooth. 
A few years later, trying to be brave, I joined my 
uncle to watch Stephen King’s The Mist. I slept with 
my sister for a week.
But at Carnegie Mellon, having both a best friend 
and a boyfriend who inexplicably love horror 
movies, I bit the bullet. As I sit through more scary 
movies with them, I gradually numb to their effects, 
and occasionally, I even enjoy them. So as a back 
to school treat, said best friend and I indulged in 
dinner and a movie: Burgatory and Don’t Breathe. 
When I saw the trailer for it, innocently enough 
trying to enjoy Sausage Party, I nearly released 
fluids. So going into Don’t Breathe, I viewed it as 
a real challenge to my horror tolerance. But just in 
case, I appealed to another of my low tolerances 
and went in two margaritas deep, stuffed to the 
gills with the burger of the day. We picked out 
seats, I put up my feet, and I unbuttoned my pants. 
I was ready to roll.
The opening scene of the movie feels like Bling Ring 
— three smug, reckless teens (Alex, Rocky, and Money) 
rummaging through a stranger’s home with an air 
of dangerous excitement. Then we get some vague 
characterization. Alex loves Rocky, but is meek and 
probably thinks she “friend-zoned” him. Conveniently, 
his father owns a home security company and keeps 
all the keys and alarm codes in their home. Alex helps 
Rocky and Money break into houses so that Rocky will 
like him? Rocky is tough because she had to be. Money 
is just a thug. We know he’s going to die first. They 
find out about a blind old Gulf War veteran sitting on a 
large cash settlement from the rich parents of a drunk 
driver who killed his daughter. Naturally they decide to 
go for it.
The build is slow and uncomfortable from the moment 
they walk in his door. As the band of idiots tiptoes 
around searching for the buried treasure, the camera 
pans across parts of the house that will eventually 
contribute to their downfall. The tension builds. 
Naively I assumed the whole film is going to be this 
silent, adrenaline-filled hide and seek game gradually 
building to a big confrontation. But no.
The confrontation comes much earlier than expected, 
and the rest of the movie is hard to describe. Not scary, 
but certainly disturbing. I didn’t throw my hands into 
my face, but I did gag several times. The real horror 
unfolds as we discover what’s hiding in his basement. 
Spoiler: it’s the girl who killed his daughter. But 
because he was down there chasing Alex and Rocky 
(Money is already dead, obviously), he takes a literal 
shot in the dark and kills his prisoner. This sets off a 
grueling chase that ends with Alex presumed dead.
Then we find Rocky all locked up in the dead girl’s 
harness. Here begins the only scene in the movie 
that truly haunts me. Because this is the justice 
system that we have established, Rocky has to 
give him a baby. And as if that concept isn’t bad 
enough on its own, he hoists her up with the harness, 
suspends her in mid-air, and pulls out a container 
of unspeakable human fluids. I’m gagging and 
wishing I’d had a third margarita. The whole theater 
is screaming. And just as he’s about to do the deed, 
Alex comes back from the dead to knock the old 
man out and unstrap Rocky. 
Alex is presumed dead one more time before 
coming back to die once and for all for Rocky, who 
gets away and makes it to California (perhaps a 
drastic oversimplification of the final hour of the 
movie). The rest of it isn’t memorable. This movie 
is much more complicated and even more stressful 
than the trailer let on. It’s not just a jumpy, or campy 
summer horror flick. It’s an episode of Fear Factor. 
Word to the wise: don’t go to see Don’t Breathe with 
your parents or younger brother or anyone you don’t 
want to look at semen with.

CMOA NIGHTIME / LIGHTIME
You walked into the golden gilded vaulting ceilings of the Carnegie Music 
Hall — hallmarks of old money — and they were aglow with the pulsing 
neon pastels of LED shells and vibrating with the sounds of some of the 
hottest electronic artists of the local music collectives VIA and Hot Mass. 
The event was the Carnegie Museum of Art’s NIGHTTIME Party from 7 
p.m. to 4 a.m. this past Friday, Sept. 9, which was held to kick off the 
Hillman Photography Initiative’s LIGHTIME year-long series. 
The evening began with smaller events in the Carnegie Museum of Art 
itself with some new installations of light based art and an interactive 
three-dkimensional time lapse of the Forbes and Craig intersection where 
you are able to “move through time” by moving your body.
These exhibits existed along side the traditional art museum exhibits, only 
augmented by a photo-booth style event in the middle and the distant, 
subtle oozing of electronic beat and bass through the walls and floors. The 
CMOA has been working at making these kinds of late night events with 
contemporary DJs and bands a more regular thing in an effort to make the 
museum more “relevant” and “approachable.”
However, these events still continue to be a bastion of a specific kind of 
elitism, that is merely the yuppier, new-money version of the gilded col-
umns and expensive paintings housing this event. Beginning with the $25 
entrance fee, the event primarily focused on the party side and less on the 
art. The event is actually the kick off of a year-long photography initiative 
looking at how light can be used to tell stories, with the themes of percep-
tion, environment, movement, and social justice.
To be fair, the information about these topics and this series were on fairly 
underwhelming information cards and the exhibit parts were somewhat 
unclear. However, the the general vibe of the event-goers was focused on 
seeing and being seen rather than finding out more about the art itself.
The typical interaction many of the partygoers had with the exhibits was 
in drunkenly stumbling past them. The sense of trendy elitism aside, this 
event was all around a fantastic and surreal landscape of techno and 
bright lights reflecting on the facades of this parallel world of gold and 
marble as people danced with hula hoops and balloons and flower crowns.
As a nightclub, the event and experience were well designed. 
As an art series, conceptually it is very interesting and should be exciting 
as these photography exhibits are unveiled over the year.
However, it feels like the party aspect in some ways relegated the art side 
to being a temporary diversion or backdrop for these young professionals 
dressed in their designer clothes, rather than promoting the art.

Dorm Storm
6
Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella groups take a tour of the freshman dormitories and enthrall
It was quiet at 8 p.m. on Tuesday night in Mudge. 
The last dewey drops of the afternoon rain were 
settling into the cobble stone flooring around 
the koi pond, and the grass took on a lustrous 
sheen that glowed under the dim light being 
thrown from street lamps around the courtyard. 
The printer was attended to a couple times, and I 
sat with my camera to my right and a little potted 
plant to my left, on the damp steps down to the 
courtyard, because I seemed to know what was 
coming better than the unsuspecting residents of 
the mansion.
As the time approached a quarter to nine, 
muffled voices began to fill the air, along with 
the shuffling of footsteps. First-years all around 
began to take note of the congregation develop-
ing in the lobby and moving into the courtyard, 
and shifted their attention to finding seats or 
good places to stand.
“What’s going on?” I heard a voice whisper 
behind me.
“I think these are the a cappella groups,” another 
responded.
I tapped my fingers on my knees in excitement 
and steadied my hand on my camera ready to lis-
ten, as Counterpoint took center stage and intro-
duced themselves.
As the first years poured in, so did their chances 
of getting involved in the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity. With the Activities Fair this Wednesday, 
and over 150 organizations present to pull people 
in, picking activities that will shape your college 
career can be a daunting experience. Thus, to 
alleviate some of the confusion, groups around 
campus find other ways to reach out and find stu-
dents, and spark intrigue where it may have not 
been expected.
One of these events is now the famous and highly 
attended Dorm Storming event hosted by the 
various a cappella groups around campus. Dorm 
Storming takes place in freshman dorms the night 
before the Activities Fair, and constitutes many 
short performances by the a cappella groups 
around campus. I had the opportunity to sit in 
on the Mudge wave, which was the first in the 
Morewood Avenue leg of the groups’ tour.
The groups in attendance, as well as the songs 
they sang over in the Mudge courtyard, were as 
follows:
C#: A soulful co-ed a cappella group with a choir 
counterpart known as Db (D-flat).
Song Performed: Super Smash Bros Theme 
Medley
Highlight: Definitely the song choice, with lyrics in 
Latin.
Saans: An all-female South Asian group that per-
forms upbeat fusion mash-ups, bringing the west 
and the east together.
Song Performed: Mash-up of “Nagada Sang Dhol“ 
(from the Bollywood movie Ram Leela) and “Here” 
by Alessia Ciara
Highlight: What made this mash-up work so well 
was the ease with which the both the songs and 
the leads’ voices melted into one another.
Soundbytes: A co-ed group with wonderful spunk 
and deep, jazzy vocals.
Song Performed: “Let’s Get It On” by Marvin Gaye
Highlight: Catherine Mondoa’s incredibly smooth 
lead vocals and the liquid chocolate lull of the rest 
of the groups backing vocals. Always a treat to lis-
ten to the Soundbytes.
Counterpoint: An all-female group that continu-
ously prove what a powerhouse they are.
Song Performed: “What You Don’t Do” by Lianne 
La Havas
Highlight: Seeing Kristen Smith move away from 
vocal percussion and flaunt her stellar pipes. I also 
want to acknowledge the beautiful smiles that 
Counterpoint always dons while making great eye 
contact with each other and the audience.
Joyful Noise: The co-ed Christian group on cam-
pus, with chilling sets and glorious chemistry.
Song Performed: “Bleeding Love” by Leona Lewis
Highlight: This entire song. I remember hearing it 
for the first time at almost midnight a cappella last 
year and squealed when I heard the first few sec-
onds this time. Phenomenal from all angles.
Deewane: The all-male South Asian group that 
pulls in singers and music lovers of all ethnicities 
to indulge in some good old-fashioned Bollywood 
serenading.
Song Performed: Mash-up of “What Makes You 
Beautiful” by One Direction and “Subha Hone 
Na De” (from the Bollywood movie Desi Boys)
Highlight: Deewane’s incredible energy is always 
infectious, and I would like to apologize here for 
being the only one to clap incredibly off-beat 
during the “What Makes Your Beautiful” seg-
ment of the mash-up. Everyone in the audience 
was bobbing their heads and singing along 
where they could. Great atmosphere.
Treblemakers: Co-ed and polished, always full 
of surprises.
Song Performed: “I’m on a Boat” by The Lonely 
Island
Highlight: Sunglasses and attitude. The Lonely 
Island never really gets the credit it deserves, 
and I appreciate this rendition of one of my 
middle school favorites a little more everytime I 
see it.
Originals: The runners-up from the 2016 Varsity 
Vocals International Championship of Collegiate 
A Cappella (ICCA), this all-male group is full of 
finesse.
Song Performed: “I Can’t Feel My Face” by The 
Weekend
Highlight: The Originals use their voices and 
body language to bring a whole new layer to 
all the songs they do. At times it felt like I was 
listening to something that had been digitally 
manipulated, and as always I felt goosebumps 
running down my arms.
A cappella is, and will be for many years to 
come, a very integral part of our community here 
at Carnegie Mellon. 
Whether it’s the Soundbytes singing at the 
Hillary Clinton rally late last academic year, the 
Originals making their way to the ICCA finals in 
New York, or even Almost Midnight A Cappella, 
with all the groups around campus, the music 
and vibes that linger in the air long after the last 
bar is sung are always memorable.
It is with this in mind that I was drawn back to 
my freshman dorm once again, and hopefully 
Tuesday night was an opportunity for many 
future a cappella sings to find a group they con-
nected with and want to audition for.

Sterling Archer 
will leave you in 
splits
The name’s Archer. Sterling Archer. A super spy who’s as deadly as he is 
juvenile and irresponsible. Add to this one of the most hostile workplaces 
you’ll ever see on TV, a spy agency run by his dominating mother. To this, 
also add his ex-girlfriend, another super spy, a ditzy receptionist, the genet-
ic clone of a genius Nazi scientist, an HR representative with an eating 
disorder, and a socially awkward accountant, and you’ve got yourself a TV 
show that is as intriguing as it is infuriating.
If you’ve ever wanted to be a super spy, you’re exactly like most of us. 
When you see characters like James Bond or Ethan Hunt, dressed to 
kill, deadly and charming, it is impossible not to want to live that life. 
If you could only be let loose in that glamorous world, right? With 
no consequences? Archer lets you live that life, and with a lot more 
humor and fun. Think James Bond meets Arrested Development and 
hop the whole thing up on steroids. It’s got plenty of references to 
sex, drugs, alcohol, and violence.
Although it is an inappropriate animated show, it’s a very different 
beast than, say, The Simpsons or South Park. It’s been drawn much 
more intricately, and while each individual scene looks like a comic 
book strip come to life, the frames are further apart than you’d 
expect, and the animation has this really unusual and janky feel to it 
that’s not as smooth as other shows. Archer stars some of the most 
talented voice actors out there; with names like H. Jon Benjamin, 
Judy Greer, and Jessica Walters, you will very quickly have a connec-
tion with all the characters, and will know what they’re like.
If you like constant rapid-fire one liners that leave you in splits, this is the 
show for you. There are very few serious moments, and the ones that are 
there are very quickly broken by Sterling Archer being the daft ignoramus 
that is Sterling Archer. His ability to not take things seriously is what makes 
this show, and is actually profoundly enviable. A bullet to the foot? Ran out 
of ammo surrounded while you’re surrounded by bad guys? In a crashing 
airplane with no parachute? Eh, could be worse. All in a day’s 
work. Running jokes are aplenty, and once you go 
through a couple episodes you’ll start to 
guess what Archer is going to say 
and how he’s going to manage 
to turn everyone’s life upside down. It’s weirdly liberating to put yourself in 
his shoes and be the most selfish, arrogant, and deadly person on the plan-
et. He’s a 6’2’’ Dennis the Menace, built like a soldier, and with a gun.
Lana Kane, Archer’s ex-girlfriend and super spy, is another very interesting 
character. She’s a far better spy than Archer, but is always in the shadow 
since Archer’s mother literally owns and runs the spy agency. She still loves 
Archer, but him being the overgrown child he is, she just cannot trust him 
with her feelings. She’s also one of the most badass female characters in any 
show I’ve seen, with her twin TEC-9s.
Judy Greer voices the ditzy secretary (minor spoiler — who’s also a billion-
aire related to the Tunt family, that owns most of the railroad in the U.S.) 
is one of the most critically acclaimed characters in the show. She’s 
unpredictable, addicted to sniffing glue, and very very into vio-
lence.
Television today gets repetitive. Having a unique premise 
and delivering on that premise can go a long way for the 
show, and Archer banks on this. Jessica Walters voices 
an amazing dominant Mallory Archer, and Sterling 
Archer’s childhood issues play a huge role in how he is 
today, and him being a deadly super spy just makes it 
all the more interesting. Imagine having your mother 
be your boss, all while you’re the most feared spy and 
assassin in the world. That’s right, you can’t. Watch 
Archer and you won’t have to.
Archer takes the slick, suave, super spy stereotype 
and rips it to shreds. If you enjoy guns, explo-
sions, cool gadgets and other spy movie 
tropes, this show will reel you in and sub-
vert every expectation you might have 
in whatever way you’d least expect it. 
It’s on Netflix, and there’s multiple 
seasons of it. You’re welcome.
Rohit Harlalka | Staffwriter
Lana Kane, Archer’s ex-girlfriend, 
is a far better superspy than he is. 
However, as his mother runs the 
spy agency they work for, she 
constantly lives in his shadow.
Mallory Archer, Sterling’s 
mother, runs the spy agency he 
works for like a paranoid totalitarian. 
She also frequently abuses her 
position to further his career.
Sterling Archer, a suave superspy 
on the surface, is a spoilt and 
irresponsible womanizer who 
always seems to get away without 
any consequences for his actions.

out on Friday. You wake up in a daze, and your mind 
doesn’t help by letting you know that Monday is far 
away. So you turn to social media; you go through 
your Facebook newsfeed, you buzz through Buzzfeed 
articles, you checkout Instagram, and you check 
snapchat for reminders of exactly how crazy last night 
was. Finally, you turn to Netlix, browsing through the 
titles of things you don’t want to see. However, you 
decide that today you are going to take a chance and 
watch that one movie that doesn’t look that tempting 
in the hope that it is something original, something 
that makes you smile, something that makes your day. 
You ind Tokyo Fiancée.
This movie is told from the perspective of Amélie, 
a 20-year-old Belgian girl who was born in Japan. 
Although Amélie was born in Japan, she only lived 
there until she was ive. Now she returns to immerse 
herself in Japanese culture. To support herself and 
her Japanese lessons she starts teaching French 
to Rinri, a boy from a wealthy traditional Japanese 
family, who, ironically enough, aspires to emulate 
European culture. Soon they start dating and the story 
progresses with Rinri showing Amélie his Japan.
This is when we are transported from our couches and 
chairs — or, in my case, bed — to Japan and taken on 
a grand tour by a local. I love movies which transport 
you to different places and immerse you in different 
cultures. Movies have this ability to give you the feel 
of a place, and that is exactly what this movie does so 
well: it makes you feel like you are in Japan.
Yes, yes, I hear you movie buffs chanting Lost in 
Translation by Soia Coppola — Yes, I have watched it! 
Yes, I really liked it! But let’s not be so lost in translation 
anymore! Let’s attempt to understand each other. 
That’s what this movie is about: Amélie’s attempt to 
understand Japan, and to understand Japan through 
Rinri.
This happens in several ways, such as when Amélie 
visits Rinri’s home. We get to see all the ultra-modern 
amenities in his kitchen and his robot pet, but we also 
get to see a hidden basement full of old books and 
antiques. Another way is through Rinri’s preferences: 
his Yakuza ilms, his karaoke, and his liking for pole 
dancing clubs. We also get to understand Japan 
through the couple’s adventures. One scene stands 
out among others — Rinri takes Amélie to see the 
trains, and behind the train lines is a man who sings 
when the trains are passing by. Amélie asks why the 
man sings in that spot since it’s impossible for him 
to hear his own voice. To this, Rinri responds that he 
doesn’t want to disturb anyone.
Other than getting Japan’s image right, this movie 
also does little things that make me smile. For 
example, whenever Amélie imagines her future, it 
is shown inside a traditional Japanese house with 
Japanese music. In one instance, when Amélie 
imagines that Rinri has become her Japanese lover, 
she breaks out into song and dance wearing a shirt 
with the Japanese lag on it and singing in Japanese. 
These scenes really help dissipate the tension of the 
ilm and add a little humor to it. Another thing that 
made me smile while watching the movie was how 
it introduces another western girl, a French woman 
who, like Amélie, wants to be Japanese. The movie 
progresses to show her getting married to a Japanese 
man; this serves as a great parallel to Amélie and 
Rinri’s story. One more thing that made me smile was 
the way food is shot in the ilm. There is a lot of it, and 
it looks really really good! You have been warned: do 
not watch this ilm on an empty stomach!
Having mentioned these great things, I have to 
say that every movie does have its laws. There 
was an entire section of the movie about Amélie 
rediscovering herself when she got lost while trying 
to climb a mountain that I didn’t quite get the 
signiicance of. Also, in a crucial scene in the ilm, 
when she is about to mention something important, 
an octopus literally got her tongue. Eating live 
octopus actually is a thing in Japan. I thought that was 
a little too ironic, a little too coincidental.
Imperfections and minor quibbles aside, I really 
enjoyed the movie. The ending, I can say without 
giving too much away, is bittersweet. You may wish 
for another payoff, but with the way the story goes no 
other payoff would have truly satisied you as a viewer. 
So, give it a watch on a lazy Saturday — maybe it will 
leave a smile on your face too.

The grand conclusion of the X-Men saga, Apocalypse, puts our mutant heroes 
through their most trying ordeal yet. An ancient mutant named En-Sabah-Nur, 
played by Oscar Isaac, who ruled the world as a God millennia ago, has risen 
again to wipe out modern civilization and remake it in his image and reclaim his 
place as principal deity and ruler. In the process, Sabah-Nur runs up against the 
X-Men, led by Charles Xavier. Faced with their toughest enemy ever, the X-Men 
must make decisions that will leave permanent scars on every one of them. 
Apocalypse touches on several interesting themes — leadership, family and 
belonging — and takes familiar characters in interesting new directions.

Send Silence Packing was a 4-hour-long 
outdoor art exhibit on the CFA lawn meant 
to spread awareness about mental health on

Active Minds @ Carnegie Mellon, the exhibit 
featured the schoolbags of students who 
took their own lives from across the country, 
donated by the parents of the students, often
