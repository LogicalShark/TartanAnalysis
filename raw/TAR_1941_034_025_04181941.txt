Three hundred and fifty mem­
bers of the student body signed 
petitions, requesting that Student 
Council’s decision to oust Leonard 
Shatzkin, editor of the TARTAN, 
be presented to a student assem­
bly immediately. According to the 
Student Council Constitution a 
petition signed by 300 students 
is sufficient to require the presi­
dent of council to call such an 
assembly.
Until such an assembly is held 
the decision--of- Council stands, 
and the former managing editor 
of the TARTAN, Eleanor Oshry, 
’41, is editor of the paper. The 
other members of the senior staff 
all advanced one position as pro­
vided in the TARTAN constitu­
tion.
The petition requesting an im­
mediate assembly of the student 
body to reconsider the ouster of 
the TARTAN editor was present­
ed to Bill Floyd after the Student 
Council meeting on Tuesday.
It was at the previous meet­
ing of Council that the motion 
to declare the editorship of the 
TARTAN “vacant” was passed. 
The vote climaxed a lengthy dis­
cussion.
William Heilman, before the 
vote was taken, warned- the mem­
bers of Council that administra­
tion members had demanded 
that something be done, and he 
pointed out that Council would 
be held responsible by them un­
less something was done. Mr. Mc- 
Garvey reminded Council that the 
action that was taken would be 
as a result of the TARTAN pol­
icy for thè entire year, and not 
as a result simply of the April 
Fool issue. Neither he nor Mr. 
Heilman stated precisely what 
this policy was, except for men­
tioning the single issue in which

New Features 
Headline Annual 
Exhibition Night
Since the founding of Carnegie 
Tech, it has been the custom for 
the entire school to hold an open 
house once a year. This year the 
thirty-fifth annual exhibition 
will be held. on Friday evening, 
April 25.
Between the hours of 7:30 and 
10:30 all the buildings will be 
open to the public and students 
will be at work in the laborator­
ies, studios, and shops of the 
various departments.
The exhibition will be high­
lighted by three new features. 
First: An additional issue of
larger-than-ordinary size of the 
Carnegie TARTAN will be pub­
lished for Friday evening. The 
issue will take the form of a 
souvenir edition.
Second: Steel-making in minia­
ture will be demonstrated for the 
public by the United States Steel 
World’s Fair exhibit, recently 
presented to Carnegie. The ex­
hibit consists of three dioramas 
« representing the Blast Furnace, 
Open Hearth, and Rolling Mill 
processes. The dioramas have 
been set up in Engineering Hall.
Third: Engineering defense
training will be continued as us­
ual, giving the public an oppor­
tunity to witness the machinery 
of defense in operation. There 
will be no interruption of recita­
tions in the defense courses, but 
the laboratories and shop cours­
es will be open for inspection.
At 7:00 P. M. prior to the open­
ing of the buildings, the R. O. 
T. C. will hold a dress parade on 
the campus adjoining Morewood 
Avenue. The Kiltie Band will as­
sist. Following the parade, weath­
er permitting, the Band will play 
a half-hour program of concert 
music on the campus near the 
Tech flagpole.
Students of music and drama 
will present a program at the 
Theatre of the College of Fine 
Arts from 8:00 to 10:00. A mili­
tary wedding will be featured 
with members of the R. O. T. C. 
talcing part.
Kiltie Concert
On Thursday evening, April 
24, at 8:15 P. M., the Kiltie Band 
will present their Third Annual 
Concert in Carnegie Music Hall. 
The program will be varied so as 
to be interesting to everyone, 
featuring serious concert num­
bers, solos, marches and novel­
ties.
Throughout the year the band 
has been making trips to local 
high schools to fulfill concert en­
gagements.
Tickets may be secured from 
any member of the band. All seats 
will be reserved. The cost is 50c 
for first floor and balcony tickets 
and 25c for second balcony seats.
Theta Xi Shut Off 
From Outside World
By A GREEK
The mistakes of the Theta Xi 
rushing season have caught up 
with the boys at the fraternity 
house. Theta Xi took the max­
im about “catching them young” a 
little too seriously, and wound 
up with a freshman of pre­
measles age.
There is no rule on the age or 
size limit on freshmen during the 
hunting season, so that Theta Xi 
faux pas did not represent an in­
fraction of school rules, but 
measles finally caught up with 
Fred Corey and the mistake 
caught up with Theta Xi.
The entire house is now under 
quarantine by order of the De­
partment of Health. The boys 
who were out of the house when 
the quarantine was slapped on 
are sleeping on park benches for 
all we know. The boys who are 
stuck in there now will be glad 
to get back to class before this 
is over.
Classes Vote 
For Officers
For the third consecutive 
school-week, an election will be 
held this Tuesday, April 22, from 
11:30 to 1:30. These elections will 
determine Sophomore, Junior and 
Senior class officers in all three 
colleges, senate representatives 
for all three colleges, and three 
assistant treasurers and three as­
sistant secretaries for Student 
Council.
Council had hoped to be able 
to obtain voting-machines for this 
election, ' but was unable to do 
so, because the City-County Of- 
¦ fice,' which supplies the machines, 
njust have at least four days no­
tice before it can set up the ma­
chines. Since Easter vacation in­
terfered with the opportunities 
to have petitions in in plenty of 
time, the election will have to be 
by ballot.
As was done in the last class 
election, a faculty advisory board 
will be appointed by Dr. Warden 
to help Council members watch 
the polls. Candidates and their 
party-affiliations are printed on 
the box at the bottom of the page.
The polling places will be in 
room 70, Engineering Hall, for 
Freshmen and Sophomores; the 
old “Y” room in Industries for 
Juniors and Seniors; room 107, 
Arts school; and probably room 
103, Margaret Morrison. The 
Freshmen will vote for next 
year’s Sophomore class officers, 
the present Sophomores will vote 
for the coming Junior class of­
ficers, and the Juniors will vote 
for the incoming Senior class 
officers In the class elections. The 
entire student body will vote in 
the all-school elections in their 
respective colleges.
M*rextj Elected
Charles Richardson, Printing ’42, 
was elected President of Student 
Council for next year at the meet­
ing of Council Tuesday night. 
Harvey Hill was elected Treasurer 
and Dorothy Piper, Secretary.

Fifty Hooks of Year Exhibited
Students passing through the 
lower hall of Industries have no 
doubt wondered about the' var­
ious books whcih are on exhibi­
tion in the cases at the entrance 
to the composing and layout 
rooms of the Printing Depart­
ment.
This exhibition, known as the 
Fifty Books of the Year, is chos­
en annually by a jury of three, 
representing The American Insti­
tute of Graphic Arts. The jury 
this year consisted of Irita Van 
Doren, William A. Jackson, and 
Walter Darwin Teague, three 
prominent members of the book 
publishing industry. To them 
went the task of selecting from 
among 600 competing books the 
fifty most typographically perfect.
The literary content of each 
book is considered only as it re­
lates to the problems of typo­
graphic design and production. In 
appraising the’ physical excel­
lence of a book the jury consid­
ers the material, design, and
workmanship of the binding; the 
choice of the paper and type face;' 
the legibility and attractiveness 
of the. page; the use of color and 
illustration; the register and im­
pression; the typographic design 
throughout; the artistic concep­
tion and cohesion of the whole; 
the book’s durability and fitness 
for use for which it is intended; 
and the success with which the 
designer has met the problems 
of manufacture and those pre­
sented by the book’s editorial 
content.
The selection of the fifty best 
books proved quite a difficult task 
this year due to the general im­
provement in book publishing, 
and as usual once the choice was 
made many complaints were 
heard.
Two former students of the De­
partment of Printing, George W. 
Van Vechten, Jr., and Helen 
Gentry, had the honor of having 
books designed by them in this 
year’s selection. Miss Gentry is
one of the few women students 
who has taken courses at the 
Printing Department.
This year’s exhibition shows a 
definite trend toward better de­
signing in children’s books and 
popular novels. William Saroy­
an’s popular autobiographical 
novel, “My Name Is Aram,” 
shows up in the latter class as 
well as Kenneth Roberts’ “Oliver 
Wiswell.” One of the best design­
ings in the collection is done by 
Bruce Rogers on “The Odyssey of 
Homer;” what makes the book 
doubly interesting is that it was 
translated from the Greek by E. 
T. Shaw, better known as Law­
rence of Arabia.
The Exhibition, which is spon­
sored by the Department of 
Printing in conjunction with its 
annual reunion, was loaned to the 
Department by The American In­
stitute of Graphic Arts and was 
arranged by Professor Sterling 
and several students of the De­
partment.
Alumni of the Dept, of Print­
ing and various notables in the 
printing and publishing indus­
try will convene on the Tech 
campus today and tomorrow for 
the Department’s Annual Reun­
ion and Advisory Council Meet­
ings.
This afternoon will be devoted 
principally to alumni activities. 
The graduates will inspect the 
printing laboratories and see 
classes in actual operation. At 
three o’clock Dr. Jones will give 
a welcome address and will speak 
informally on the subject of 
printing education at Tech. The 
evening will be spent by the 
alumni in business meetings and 
general “get-togethers.”
The keynote of the general dis­
cussions will be given by Donald 
Rein, Executive Secretary of the 
United Typothetea of America. His 
talk, “New Problems for Manage­
ment,” will be based on a nation­
al survey conducted by Donald 
L. Boyd and himself. Mr. Boyd 
was a former printing student at 
’ Tech and is now Vice-president 
of the Standard Printing and En­
graving Company of Huntington, 
West Va.
Following Mr. Rein’s talk, Har­
ry L. Gage, former Head of the 
Department, and now Vice-presl- 
dent of Morgenthaler Linotype 
Co., will load a discussion on 
“New Problems In Graphic Arts 
Education.”
The remainder of the morning 
and afternoon will bo spent in 
discussion groups, which are led 
by various faculty members ol! 
the Department of Printing.
These discussion groups will 
embrace problems in design, per­
sonnel, equipment, and market­
ing',’ and will, place special, em­
phasis on now developments in 
processes and materials.
The Reunion will be climaxed 
by a banquet held at the Pitts­
burgh Athletic Association. 
Laurence B. Siegfried, University 
Printer of Syracuse University 
and Editor of “The American 
Printer," from 1929 to 1040, will 
be the guest speaker. Mr. Sieg­
fried is nationally known as a 
designer and has written several 
books on advertising design. For 
three years he was Vice-President 
and a Director in the American 
Institute of Graphic Arts and has 
contributed loyally to this or­
ganization.
Three former heads and sever­
al former instructors of the Dept, 
have announced their intention 
to attend this year’s reunion and 
reservations have already been 
accepted from alumni who now 
reside in states ranging from 
Rhode Island to Virginia.

Hydraulics Lab 
Runs Dam Tests
Tech’s Hydraulics Research La­
boratory has just received a con­
tract from the War Department 
to run a series of tests on cavita­
tion for the Bonneville Dam in 
the Columbia River.
Cavitation is a technical term 
referring to the erosion of the 
dam structures. In this particular 
case the baffle piers on the spill­
way of this dam, one of the larg­
est hydro-electric dams in the 
world,, are slowly being eaten 
away.

---------------------------------------------------

THE CABHEGIE TABTANFRIDAY, APRIL 18, 1941
Printers Convene
The staff! of the TAUT AN is happy to join with the students 
and facility at Carnegie in welcoming visitors to the Annual Re­
union of the Department of Printing.
Many people, on hearing for the first time that a regular 
eoul'se of instruction in printing is offered by a College of En­
gineering raise their eyebrows in surprise. They are ,justified in 
their astonishment, for Carnegie’s Department of Printing is 
the only one ol’ its kind.
Speculation as to whether such a course has a place in the 
College curriculum has been dissipated by the excellent record 
of accomplishment of the Department. Experience at Carnegie 
has demonstrated that the field of the graphic arts has for too long 
been neglected by our educational system. The tendency to shift 
the burden of printing education upon the trade schools and 
trade associations lias for along time prevented the realization 
that the graphic arts deserve a place alongside the other en­
gineering and arts professions.
The Department of Printing is almost unique in other ways. 
It is certainly one of the most progressive departments at Car­
negie Tech. Students and faculty are constantly on the lookout 
for new ideas and new methods and fields of instruction. The de­
partment continues to expand its facilities and the improvement 
in the opportunities it offers its students are clearly evident from 
year to year.
This improvement is evident not only in terms of more mod­
ern physical equipment, but also in the attitude of the instructors 
and students toward each other and toward their work. The spir­
it of eameraderie and friendship is strong enough to be obvious 
to anyone who visits the classrooms and laboratories of the De­
partment of Printing. It is common to see the lights of the de­
partment rooms on far into the night as students and faculty 
members remain long after scheduled hours to do their work. The 
spirit of the search for knowledge, the acquisition of skill and a 
standard for the appreciation of values in their chosen field is 
embodied in the attitude of these men.
All this has made real the service which the department ren­
ders both to its members and to the industry. This is evidenced 
by the success of its graduates and by the interest in its work dis­
played by leaders in the field of printing and printing education.
An important part of that service is the Annual Reunion for 
which interested people have today arrived from all parts of the 
country. In the interests of sharing their information and join­
ing in the solution of common problems they have gathered to 
hear informative talks and participate in technical discussions.
The Printing Department reunion indicates a worthwhile 
channel for the activities of faculty and alumni of all depart­
ments. It is a practical example of how alumni activities and 
the interest of leaders in the field can be coordinated by an ed­
ucational institution to the benefit of industry, alumni and the 
student body.
We welcome the friends of the Department of Printing to our 
campus, and we salute the department for its demonstration of 
sound educational practice.
Elections Merit Attention
Another year has passed and election for class officers is 
again being held on Tuesday.
Although the decisions before the students before they cast 
their votes are not of as far-reaching importance as those made 
before a national election, it is true that student government and 
student life here at Tech for the coming year depend on the re­
sults of these elections.
National elections arc replete with fanfare and carnival 
spirit. No one is staging a circus at Tech to get the vote out.
But, there arc real responsibilities involved in this election. 
A student has no right to complain about student government 
il! lie is too lazy or too smug to vote.
Every Tuesday night, decisions are made at Student Council 
meetings which aft’ect the campus life of every student. Out of 
the fees paid by each student at registration time approximately 
live dollars remains under the jurisdiction of Student Council. 
If is up lo the student government to allot the money to various 
campus activities.
Student Council was also responsible this year, for example, 
in changing the dates ol* the Christmas recess. It has an ad­
visory voice in such matters as Saturday classes, athletic policy, 
etc.
II! your voice is to be heard and faithfully represented on 
these and other issues, it must be heard at election time.

Letter to the Editorggg
To the Editor of the TARTAN:
Many students often ask how 
editors of the Thistle become edi­
tors. The exact mechanism can­
not be described, but judge for 
yourself.
Since 1934, the Editor of the 
Thistle has been a member of Beta 
Theta Pi. Year after year, the 
editorship has been handed down, 
just like the folklore of the ages. 
Quite interesting is the fact that 
from 1934 to 1937, the Business 
Manager was a member of Alpha 
Tau Omega. In 1937 they fell 
from favor with the “powers” and 
a Beta has been Business Manager 
ever since.
Surely the Beta’s aren’t the only 
ones on the staff. One of the 
Thistle staff was heard using this 
half-backed argument to justify 
the “inevitability” of Beta control. 
“The Beta’s should control the 
Thistle because they (the Beta’s) 
had started it. Who is paying the 
money, to have the Thistle printed? 
The studenis are, through their 
fees and subscriptions. If the
Oil the Cull
Eastah time was de time for 
eggs and Tartan time was de time 
for gossip.
Jimmy Frew and Marjorie 
Weatherwax are very much back 
together again.
The rumor about the D. U. 
house actually came true in the 
case of the Theta Xi’s who are 
quarantined for measles. Tough 
luck, boys, with Carnival coming 
.up.
We hear that Crawford Mur- 
ton is dating Barbara Burns for 
the Kappa Sig Spring formal to­
night, and incidentally the black­
out. Others present will be Peg 
Curtis and Paul Guinther, Ruth 
Storm and George Richardson.
Jim McGarvey has decided that 
what is- the campus’ favorite dish 
is his also; at least he would like 
Margaret Sullivan to be.
Seen hobnobbing all over the 
place are Ed Shatz and Nancy 
Stader; what spring will do!
Cutest nickname of the week— 
Bob Deans’ “Burrhead.”
Bill Floyd refuses to reveal his 
date for Carnival; by process of 
eliminating 2098 people on camp­
us we assume his date is the 
2099th. (There are 2100 people at 
Tech, get it?)
It seems that Bob Beck really 
goes for Helen Marc, though we 
thought it was just the competi­
tion that attracted him at first.
Is it just bridge that causes 
Ruth Hogg and Bob Dominy to 
seek each other’s company so 
often?
Why is it that every time Mad­
eline Forsythe goes to Bethany 
tor a week-end, Fred Dietrich 
takes out his high school flame? 
Robbin’ the cradle is fun some­
times.
Orchids to Jim Sions for stand­
ing up under all the criticism 
which he has undeservedly been 
receiving. There’s always a last 
laugh, Jim.
’Tis spring when a senior’s fan­
cy turns to thoughts of when and 
mainly IF he is going to gradu­
ate.
Dates for Carnival: Virginia
Frances and Ken Sloan, Ruth 
Molvie and Hal Farquahar, Ruth 
Beale and Bill Carey.
Cutest nickname of the week— 
“Ten-percent Tishlarich.”
So long, folks, see you Tuesday.
Chaffey Heads 
Scottie Staff
Newly-elected head of the Scot­
tie, campus humor magazine, is 
Ed Chaffe’y, ’42, Mechanical En­
gineering Dept. Other members 
of next year’s staff are as follows: 
Business Manager—Mid Pierce; 
Circulation Manager—Cy Herre; 
Managing Editor—Ed Rechberger; 
Advertising Manager—Hugo Bar- 
bian; Associate Editors — Roy 
Ertell, Dorothy Piper, Mark Shoff- 
ner, and Joanne Tishlarich; Swing 
Editor—Charles Himmler; Fea­
ture Editor—Frazier Byrum; Pub­
licity Editor—Ronnie Sandbach.
Ed Chaffey is a member of 
Fisher Body Craftsman Guild and 
of the Academy of Model Aero­
nautics. In 1936 he became the 
junior archery champion of Penn­
sylvania. At Tech Mr. Chaffey 
is a member of Scabbard and 
Blade, Interfraternity Council, 
and Pi Kappa Alpha, social fra­
ternity. When asked to what he 
attributed his writing ability, Mr. 
Chaffey modestly replied, “I just 
picked it up along the way.”
Thistle is a student publication, 
must the control of the publication 
by the Beta’s mean that only 
Beta’s are students?
When the Thistle originally 
signed the contract to get pictures 
of the seniors taken at a studio, 
the studio itself sent someone out 
to campus to take care of the de­
tails of scheduling, etc. This was 
too much wasted effort, so the 
studio arranged, through the 
Thistle, that they would pay .$50 
to someone who would do that 
work.
The final result of this was that 
it was handed out to the Thistle 
business staff as regular work 
while the Business Manager ap­
parently pocketed the fee. Some 
one got “wind” of the arrange­
ment, and the result was the re­
port of the Committee for the In­
vestigation of Salaries and Ap­
propriations given to Council last 
April. The report contained the 
above information1 and recommen­
dations to alleviate this condition, 
but no go!—S. J.

Pittsburgh will get its first taste 
of aerial warfare tonight when 
the district is blacked out against 
invader planes. Between 10:10 and 
10:15 all normal city life will 
stop, and actual conditions of a 
city being bombed will be sim­

Tech intends to cooperate with 
the authorities by darkening win­
dows facing the outside. The 
drama department’s production 
of “Comedy of Errors” will be 
undisturbed as the Little Theatre
is completely enclosed. Any 
classes permitted to carry on at 
blackout time will have to meet 
behind' drawn shades.
At 9:30 a squadron of about a 
dozen planes will take off from 
the County Airport on a “bomb­
ing mission” over the district. 
Once off on their night flight the 
squadron will range out over the 
city, flying in three formations at 
different altitudes. In lieu of dive-

Pushmobile Entries
Revamped For Race
Four Speediest 
Carts Compete 
Iu Final Heat
In a few short weeks with the 
advent of Spring Carnival, the 
various fraternity pushmobiles, or 
“buggies” will be pushed into 
competition as a part of the Car­
nival program. At the present 
time, all the buggies that were in 
competition last year are in the 
process of being overhauled and 
several new buggies are being 
constructed, all with the intent of 
winning the principal event of 
Carnival mornings.
For the benefit of the students 
that are unfamiliar with the 
course, the starting line is at the 
bottom of the hill opposite the 
doors of. Maggie Murph. The 
buggies travel up the hill past the 
gymnasium, past the blinker into 
Schenley Park and down the hill 
past the Phipps Conservatory and 
the island to the end of the bridge. 
From there the course goes up the 
drive along Industrie and past the 
Beanery or Commons to the end
Without
of the street at the gym. The 
course is approximately three- 
quarters of a mile in length and 
the usual time for it is about two 
minutes and forty seconds. The 
course is divided into five sections 
and one pusher shoves the buggy 
through each division, the driver 
piloting the buggy over the en­
tire course.
Two heats of the race are run 
on Friday morning and the four 
buggies having the fastest times 
in these heats will run in the final 
on Saturday morning. The win­
ner of the race receives one cup 
and the organization having the 
best buggy design receives a sec­
ond cup. Kappa Sigma has been 
the winner of the speed trophy 
for the last five years and the 
Betas were the winner of the de­
sign cup in 1940.
Ten buggies are expected to 
enter the race at the present time 
and will engage in active compe­
tition barring accidents. The 
Betas, Kappa Sigs, DIJs, ATOs, 
and Theta Xis are making some 
revisions on their last year’s bug­
gies and will enter their re­
vamped models.
Golf Team Will Be the Best 
In History at Tech — Overend
, The prospects for the coming 
golf season are exceedingly good. 
According to Mr. Overend, the 
team will be the best in the his­
tory of golf at Tech. One strong 
reason for his saying this is that 
all of last year’s varsity is on 
hand. Another is that there are 
several of last year’s freshman 
team doing a fine job so far in 
practice.
In addition to Jack Ellen, A1 
Gubey, Paul Loveday, Harry 
Sacks, George Tondorf and John 
Shymowski there are three or four 
men turning in good scores for 
the early practice rounds. Com­
petition for the top places is very 
keen, and the best men as far as 
match play is concerned will pro­
bably be the regulars.
The home matches will be

played at. the Pittsburgh Field 
Club and practices are held at the 
Duquesne Country Club. The 
Field Club will be the scene for 
the opener with Geneva, April 23.
The freshman team will be very 
good also. They have five matches 
this year starting with Shadyside, 
April 25. The deadline for quali­
fying for this match is April 24.
Mr. Overend is of the firm opin­
ion that if the team had a better 
backing, which has been lacking 
in previous years. If the students 
would be on hand to form a gal­
lery, golf would be an important 
sport not just another one of these 
things. To aid in informing those 
who want to attend these matches 
the Tartan will carry a schedule 
of the matches for the week.
Phi Kaps Primed For Race
Last 'Tuesday, big Frank Eymnn tossed out tlve baUls, 
threw out the bats, and spiked down the bags as the 1941 In­
tramural Softball Competition got under way. This season 
twenty-two teams have entered this year’s race, twelve ol: 
them being fraternity groups and the remaining organizations 
being made up oi! independent members of pltl Carnegie.
As in past seasons, this year’s softball contest will be sup­
ported by more young Clansmen than any other intramural 
sporting event. Competition has always been keen, and this 
year promises to be no exception. The men of Phi Kappa (last 
year's winners) will again sport practically the same team 
that carried them to victory in the 1940 event. In the fraternity 
league the Delts, Betas, PiKAs, and Kappa Sigs have shown 
signs of being able to offer some certain competition to last 
year’s champs. While in the independent division, all markers 
point to the Citeom Clan as the class of that league. However, 
either the Senior Mechanicals, Metallurgists, or Scobell Hallites 
might prove to be the dark horse in this section.
A pleasant addition to the campus equipment has been 
constructed on the edge of the soccer field. Through the ef­
forts of Mr. Eyman, and with the help of Mr. Keek, there has 
been erected a high wire fence that encloses the street side of 
this playing area. More additions such as this to the existing 
equipment of the Intramural department' would greatlj’- in­
crease their scope of activities, and prove to be a great stimulus 
to student interest in the Intramural program.
Buggies Start To Roll
Word has just come from some of ins'- wide awake spies 
that several of the fraternity teams have begun practicing for 
the coming Carnegie Sweepstakes. The only time when such 
practicing is possible is between the dim hours of five and 
seven. This means that any of you who wish to do some spy­
ing of your own must rise with the roosters.
My informers tell me the “boys on the Ilill” (the happy 
Betas) sport a gallant charger decked out in a sun catching 
aluminum shell, and weighing a mere pittance. From what I 
have been told such vehicle is far more than a delivery truck. 
By word of mouth I have learned that the Phi Kappas will 
enter a steed in this year’s race, their entrance last year being 
cancelled because they had no wheels to put on the machine. 
I also have been told (in strict confidence) that the Kappa Sigs 
are again entering the same buggy that has won this annual 
event for the past five seasons. However, there is one all im­
portant hitch in the Clyde Streeters program—their entire 
pushing squad graduated at the end of last: year. This doleful 
bit of news should he of great interest to tlie other organiza­
tions that are going to sport entries in this years event;.

Ever since the weather has per­
mitted, Tech’s track team has been 
on the circuit in the bowl getting 
ready for the rapidly approaching 
season. About half of the boys 
practiced right straight through 
the Easter vacation, which speaks 
well for the spirit of the squad.
Mr. Halferty nearly has his 
team organized sufficiently to be 
able to pick his men for the vari­
ous events. For the freshman 
team, he has picked out Whiteside 
for the hurdles and the shot-put. 
Philipchek will probably supple­
ment him in the hurdles and will 
also participate in the sprints. 
Volybrecht is scheduled for the 
quarter mile. Cantinni will take 
care of the javelin-throwing for 
the freshmen, and Pritchard will 
run the mile. Pritchard has much 
experience from high school and 
took an active part in the cross­
country team last Fall. Campbell 
.has shown talent at the pole-vault, 
and Lindberg will supplement the 
other distance runners. Wenston 
will help out on the weights.
The varsity has several boys 
back this year and will probably 
do very well this season under 
Mr. Halferty’s direction. Sprints 
will be taken care of by Pash and 
McLaughlin. Middle distance will 
be represented by Iiaupt, Hugh 
Smith, and Simboli. Marcin, 
Hardy, Paski, Datuli, and Herpic 
will run the distance events.

Already the present softball sea­

there are many more to come. 
There are twenty-two teams en­
tered in this year’s competition 
and at the very beginning the race 
has shown itself to be keen and 
intensive. These twenty-two 
teams are divided into four 
leagues, two fraternity and two 
independent. Each fraternity 
league is composed of six teams, 
and there are five teams in each 
of the two independent leagues. 
Each league will play for a winner

For Carnival
Tentative plans for Spring 
Carnival program indicate that 
the canoe tilting event will no 
longer occupy a position of ma­
jor importance in the annual 
spring regalia. Word has reach­
ed your correspondent that the 
carnival committee has planned 
several new events for this year’s 
frolic.
The virility of _ the male con­
tingent of the Arts School has 
long been questioned by the 
highly adrenal engineers. The 
slide rule pushers and esthetes 
have grown exceedingly verbose 
in suppox-ting their points of view 
of late, but until this year’s fete 
the question has never been tak­
en to the tourney field. It is, 
therefore, with a great deal of 
pleasure that we announce a soft­
ball game between me students 
of Arts and those of Science 
schools that will. take place dur­
ing this year’s carnival.
The program committee has al­
so revealed that the annual dorm 
battle atwixt the Frosh and Sen­
ior classes will be held in con­
junction with the other carnival 
events. All evidence points to­
ward an even more successful 
carnival season than ever before.

Considered by officials of the 
institution as an important 
branch of technical education, 
printing courses were established 
at the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology during the school year oi 
1913-14.
In the fall of 1913, Harry L. 
Gage was selected as the first 
head of the department. Classes 
were officially opened on Febru­
ary 9, 1914, with thirty-seven
students in attendance.
The curriculum in the early 
period of the department’s exist­
ence went through numerous 
stages of development. During the 
trial period in which changes
and readjustments were being 
made, the curriculum was not 
published in the college catalog. 
Not until three years after the 
founding of the department did 
the curriculum appear in pub­
lished bulletins.
In 1920 Professor Hoyle became 
the head of the department and 
continued to direct the work un­
til 1924. During this period the 
program of instruction was in­
creased to four years of study 
leading to the degree of Bachelor 
of Science in Printing.
Fine printing as a special field 
of instruction received recogni­
tion in the establishment of the 
Laboratory Press in 1922 with 
Porter Garnett as Master of the 
Press. This interesting experi­
ment. exerted a major influence 
on fine printing in America until 
1935 when the resignation of Mr. 
Garnett resulted in the discon­
tinuance of the Laboratory Press 
as a separate division.
Fred J. Hartman, who had been 
secretary to Dean Connelley and 
President Thomas S. Baker, was 
appointed acting head of the de­
partment in 1924 and continued 
in this capacity until 1926 when 
he left Tech to become Director 
of the Department of Education 
of the United Typothetae of Am­
erica.
In his work with the United 
Typothetae, Mr. Hartman was in­
strumental in bringing about an 
agreement in 1927 between the 
trade association and Carnegie 
Institute of Techonology which 
resulted in the contribution, over 
a period of years, of the sum of

the editorial on the strike at 
Kaufmann’s Department Store 
appeared.
Miss Thompson maintained 
that a stranger picking up a copy 
of the April Fool issue of the 
TARTAN in the streetcar would 
not know it was an April Fool 
Issue, and would think the worse 
of Carnegie Tech because of its 
newspaper. Mr. Shatzkin replied 
that anyone who could not see at 
a glance that the issue was a fa­
cetious one would be rather 
backward intellectually. Further­
more, he said, the April 1, 1940 
issue of the TARTAN was not 
labelled “April Fool Issue,” but 
no objection was raised at that 
time.
Mr. Dorshelmer said that he 
believed that a third of the 
campus disapproved of the April 
Fool Issue as obscene, and that 
it was for that reason that the 
editor should be removed. Mr. 
Shat'/.kin pointed out that no one 
would think of removing the 
SCOTT1E editor if a third of the 
campus didn’t like the SCOTTIF. 
Jokes, nor the THISTLE editor if 
the same percentage of the stu­
dent body did not approve of the 
pictures In the THISTLE.
Mr. Heilman recited Dr. Do­
herty’s code for the editors of 
publications, as stated in his let­

$125,000 by the Typothetae. The 
agreement included the consoli­
dation of the U. T. A. School of 
Printing in Indianapolis, which 
had been operated under the able 
directorship of T. G. McGrew, 
with the Carnegie department. 
This action initiated a period of 
growth and expansion of the de­
partment which brought nation­
wide recognition for Carnegie’s 
work in printing.
GRAPHIC ARTS EDUCATION, 
a magazine which was originally 
titled PRINTING EDUCATION, 
was first published by the Car­
negie Department of Printing in 
1929. This magazine is designed 
and printed throughout the Unit­
ed States.
With the absorption of the 
College of Industries by the Col­
lege of Engineering in 1934 the 
Department of Printing was con­
tinued as a separate department. 
Professor Glen U. Cleeton, who 
had been associated with the De­
partment of Psychology and the 
Departmetn of Industrial Educa­
tion at Carnegie since 1923, be­
came Head of the Department in 
1935.
During recent years, the floor 
plans of the department have 
been rearranged to present pleas­
ing surroundings for the students.
Under the leadership of Pro­
fessor Cleeton, increasing em­
phasis has been placed upon the 
professional aspect of printing.
In addition to Professor Clee­
ton, the present faculty of the de­
partment is made up of Assistant 
Professor Homer E. Sterling, 
teacher of Layout, and Design 
courses; Assistant Professor 
Charles W. Pitkin, teacher of 
Typography courses; Mr. Stanley 
Iilasta, Instructor in Machine 
Composition; and Mr. Kenneth R. 
Burchard, Instructor in Press- 
work.

Printers Meet 
For lieimion
Annual reunions of the gradu­
ates and friends of the Depart­
ment of Printing are a relatively 
new idea. They began in 1938 
when the Department celebrated 
twenty-five years of service in 
professional education in the 
graphic arts. The success of that 
celebration prompted the formu­
lation of plans for annual confer­
ences to be known as Printing 
Alumni Reunions. In 1939 and 
1940, alumni of the Department 
and representatives of various 
trade and professional associations 
in the graphic arts conducted 
jointly a technical conference on 
problems relating to printing and 
publishing.
It was at the 1939 conference 
that the Advisory Council on 
Graphic Arts Education was 
formed to aid in printing educa­
tion.
By this time the annual reun­
ions are looked forward to as a 
traditional event. The programs 
are designed to afford the spirit 
Qf good .fellowship synonomous 
with alumni reunions and to pro­
vide technical discussions of value 
to the member of the printing in­
dustry.
Well-known figures in the pro­
fession have contributed to these 
discussions in previous years. 
Frederick W. Goudy, type design­
er, Carl P. Rollins, Printer to Yale 
University, and Olin Freedman of 
Production Standards Corporation 
have already been heard.
This year’s reunion promises to 
be fully as interesting and in­
formative as those of previous 
years. In spite of unsettled world 
conditions, the Printing Depart­
ment expects to continue its re­
unions on schedule every year.

Maybe you’ve been wondering 
what that emblem that .is pasted 
on the doors of the Printing De­
partment laboratories really stands 
for. It seems to be an oversized 
fish going round an anchor and not 
really getting anyplace, but it all 
stands for something.
Q
About six or seven years ago 
several students in the Depart­
ment of Printing were printing a 
little newspaper known as “Copy” 
which was put out for members of 
the Department. They needed 
some sort of appropriate insignia 
for this paper and took their prob­
lem to Professor Sterling. What 
he designed is almost exactly what 
is used by the Department as its 
official seal. The insignia is a 
combination of the Dolphin of 
Aldus with thistle to represent the 
school. Aldus was one of the 
great publisher-printers in early

Published Here
Written by Bernard Lewis, for­
mer editor of the TARTAN, and 
produced by the Carnegie Depart­
ment of Printing. Behind the Type 
is ready to be presented to the 
public as the most important 
graphic arts keepsake of the year.
In February, 1938, Frederic 
Goudy was guest speaker at the 
celebration of the twenty-fifth an­
niversary of the founding of the 
Department of Printing here. In­
spired by the life and work of Mr. 
Goudy, Bernard Lewis, a student 
in the department, began prepara­
tion of the life story of America’s 
foremost type designer.
The story of Goudy as presented 
by Mr. Lewis is a running narra­
tive set forth in interesting style 
and replete with incidents and 
anecdotes as yet untold.

It was the custom of early print­
ers, and is still the custom today, 
for all printers to have some sort 
of identifying seal commonly 
called “printer’s mark.”
When The Department of Print­
ing was looking around for an ap­
propriate seal, Professor Sterling 
suggested that that used by “Copy” 
might do the job. That’s why the 
Printers have that fish swimming 
around on their lab doors.
