LNJ—
WAYNESBURG HERE SATUR­
DAY.
Skinned noses and blackened eyes 
will be all the rage around school un­
til after Thanksgiving. The football 
squad indulged in the first scrimmage 
last Thursday and now wear the bat­
tered, bruised, but confident air of sea­
soned warriors. The squad has dwin­
dled slightly in numbers, but still con­
sists of some thirty men. Coach Rams- 
dell and Capt. Taylor are hoping that 
more new material will report, as a 
large number of big men are loafing 
around.
The make-up of the team will be 
unsettled until just before the first 
game next Saturday, and will after­
ward, in all probability, be subject 
to radical changes. The middle lines­
men appear to be the best of the 
squad, but the ends and back field men 
are due for a lot of hard work and 
coaching.
Among the new men who look good 
are McCaughey, a substitute on last 
year’s State team; Dougherty, a star 
from Jeannette High School, and Lucas 
of Greensburg. Clair is another new 
man who is said to possess some kick­
ing ability. Moorehead, of last year’s 
varsity was forced out of the game 
early this year as a result of the in­
jury to his knee, received in the State 
game last season, and will probably be 
unable to play this year.
Coach Ramsdell, Dr. Marks, and 
Director McCullough have been work­
ing hard together in rounding the team
into shape. All three may be seen 
any evening on the field in uniform, 
instructing the various divisions of 
the squad. If a good team does not 
result,, the coaching can certainly not 
be blamed.
The Tartan representative could 
not secure a probable line-up for Sat­
urday’s game with Waynesburg, that 
the coaches would approve, but gives 
the following as most probable:
Left End—Holliday or Blair.
Left Tackle—Crawford.
Left Guard—McCaughey.
Center—T aylor.
Right Guard—Clair.
Right Tackle—Lewis.
Right End—Murphy or Vaughn.
Quarter Back—Blanchard or Lucas.
Left Half Back—Balsinger or Buck.
Right Half Back—Lose.
Full Back—Schmucker or Daugh­
erty.

PUBLICITY BUREAU 
MANAGER APPOINTED
As announced in last week’s issue 
of the TARTAN, a manager for the 
new Publicity Bureau was appointed 
last Friday, D. W. Wait, of the School 
of Applied Design, being selected to 
fill the position. Wait is at present 
the Business Manager of the TAR­
TAN and will continue to act in that 
capacity in addition to his new duties. 
He will start immediately to put the 
Bureau in running order and tq get 
the football program ready for the 
first game next Saturday.
COACH RAMSDELL.
Mr. Fred L. Ramsdell, whose pic­
ture appeared in last week’s issue, is 
the head coach for all athletic sports 
under the Department of Student 
Health. The office was created this 
year and marks an advance in its de­
partment.
Mr. Ramsdell is an athlete of inter­
national reputation. Besides being a 
member of the All-American football 
teams of 1908 and 1909, he holds the 
world's record of 9 3-5 seconds for 
100 yards. During the past summer 
he toured England, Scotland and Ger­
many, competing against the best ath­
letes of those countries. He was de­
feated but twice in some fifteen races. 
He has taken hold of the hard task of 
developing a winning team from light 
material in a manner that has won 
the admiration and loyalty of the men, 
and good results are bound to follow.

ADDITIONAL FACULTY AP­
POINTMENTS.
The following appointments were 
made to the Faculty too late to be 
published with the list of new appoint­
ments in Iasi week’s Tartan. They 
are as follows.
Dr Z. T. Miller, Lecturer in Artistic 
Anatomy.
School of Applied Design. 
Robert J. McDowell, Instructor in 
Choral Singing.
BE SURE THAT YOU 
GET YOUR TARTAN 
Point and Times of Distribution.
The experience of last week proved 
that the student-body were not all 
fully aware of the fact that there was 
a TARTAN waiting for them, and a 
good many did not, despite the notices 
posted, know where and when to get 
their copy. And so that in the future 
each member of the student-body may 
receive his TARTAN we are publish­
ing the place and the hours at which 
copies may be obtained. For the 
Schools of Applied Science, Applied 
Design, and Applied Industries, the 
distribution point will be the Student 
Activities room in the Industries 
Building. The room number is 1, and 
the room is in the lower corridor next 
the "store room. The hours at which 
it will be open for the purpose are 
as follows:
THURSDAY
From12:00 to 2:00P.M.
From3:45 to 4:15P.M.
From4:45 to 5:15P.M.
From7:00 to 7:40P.M.
From9:20 to 10:00P.M.
FRIDAY.
From8:30 to 9:00A.M.
From7:00 to 7:40P.M.
It will be our earnest endeavor to 
do our part and it will be up to the 
individual student to see that he is 
getting what is coming to him. If he 
fails it will be entirely his own fault.

to the Schools. It is life size, the 
heavy gold frame being seven and a 
half feet by five and a half feet, and 
the artist who did the work is How­
ard Russell Butler, of New York. 
He has shown the Founder in the 
role of Lord Rector of the University 
of St. Andrews, a post of great aca­
demic distinction which Mr. Carnegie 
held for six years. In the portrait he 
is shown wearing the purple gown 
with scarlet hood and sleeve cuffs, 
which denotes his rank as Doctor of 
Letters, this degree having been con­
ferred upon him at the same time as 
his rectorship.
The University of St. Andrews is 
the oldest university in Scotland, hav­
ing been founded in 1411 in the 
ancient seaport of St. Andrew. Its 
rectorships have been valued by such 
men as Disraeli, Tennyson, Carlyle, 
Lord Roseberry, the Marquis of Bute 
and Lord Salisbury. The present 
chancellor is Lord Arthur Balfour, K. 
T., LL. D.

THE FOOTBALL SEASON.
On Saturday the football season for 
Tech opens in earnest with a game on 
Tech Field, Waynesburg College be­
ing our opponents for the occasion. 
The TARTAN desires to here express 
its faith in Captain Taylor and his 
team and to wish them all success in 
the campaign ahead.
Of the student-body at large the 
TARTAN asks this. Support your 
team as they deserve to be supported. 
You will have then done your duty 
and will have something to be proud 
of at the end of the season.-----------o-----------
TO THE PUBLICITY BUREAU
Last week the TARTAN spoke of 
the Publicity Bureau and of the work 
that it was going to do. It will be 
noticed in the news columns that a 
manager has been appointed and that 
the actual work of organizing the 
bureau has been started in a more 
systematic manner. Like the football 
team, it has a campign of very hard 
and difficult work ahead of it and much 
must be accomplished before it can 
be said to have really found itself and 
earned its place. To it and to its 
manager the TARTAN wishes suc­
cess.
-----------o-----------
THE MUDDY TRAIL.
Once upon a time Tech was the 
proud possessor of a real boardwalk. 
Maybe that is putting it too strongly 
and we should say, nearly a real 
boardwalk. It was a very important 
highway, leading us away from classes 
towards Tech Field and—well other 
things. Now it is no more. It has 
gone the way of other and better 
things in this busy world of practical 
affairs. In order that the B. & F. R.
R. could keep its trains on schedule 
was it sacrificed. And so, dear 
friends, do we walk the Muddy Trail. 
Three times each way a day do we 
walk it. Six times a day do we, with 
fear and trembling, dodging the fast 
flying expresses, get our feet muddy. 
And one solution is so simple that 
even we have thought of it! By plank­
ing between the rails the old board 
walk would be practically restored. 
----------------o----------------
There is just one place for a Tech 
man Saturday and that is Tech Field.
* * *
In the new Design building it is 
provided that the concourse for the 
students shall be of stone, even to the 
ceiling. Not at all a bad idea.
* * *
Do you walk the Muddy Trail?
* * *
The poor Commercial engineers 
were placed up next the roof. It may 
be well to start off high in life, but it 
is rumored that they are going in a 
body to Dean Leete and demand ele­
vator keys.
* * *
It does not seem like old times to 
pass over the week without a mention 
of the Junior Mechanicals.
* * *
It is with great regret that the Sci­
ence men noticed that the Thursday 
morning lectures had been left off the 
schedule this semester. Mr. McDowell 
and the Glee Club manager are also 
shedding tears.
* * *
To be truly up to date we should 
have a political club. These do be 
spirited times.
* * *
It is to be hoped that the Sopho­
mores will make the fresh ones mind 
their P’s and Q’s. One thing should 
be insisted upon and that is attend­
ance at the football games. It is 
always well to bring the children up 
with proper habits.
GOOD ADVICE.
Dr. Humphreys, President of the 
Stevens Institute, in his opening ad­
dress to the students this year, said 
in part:
“For the student to get the most 
out of his college life there must be 
co-operation between the classes, the 
fraternities, and the student organiza­
tions, and more especially, between 
the students and the faculty.
President Humphreys denounced 
cramming as an extremely bad prac­
tice, saying that he had no use for 
men who did their studying on the 
day before the examination. “Cram­
ming,” he said, “is merely review 
with the hard study omitted.” The 
students were told to cultivate the 
habit of consulting the bulletin 
boards; that ignorance of the rules 
and regulations would not be accepted 
as an excuse; that the restraints 
placed upon the student and the col­
lege, should not be too hastily con­
demned; that they should be active in 
student organizations but not too 
active; and that they should do their 
work regularly.
FILE YOUR PITTSBURGH AD­
DRESS.
Those students who were unable to 
give a Pittsburgh address when they 
registered, owing to uncompleted liv­
ing arrangements, are requested to 
hand in as soon as possible at the 
Registrar’s Office a local address for 
record purposes, and the catalogue.

ALUMNI NOTES.
William F. Burkhart, Design, ’11, has 
recently secured a fellowship at the 
University of Pennsylvania. In addi­
tion to pursuing a post graduate 
course he will act as instructor in Ar­
chitectural Design.* * *
Several of the Alumni have been 
married since school closed last June: 
Albert Henderson, better known as 
“Scotty,” was married to Miss Mari­
anna Jamie, of Pittsburg. Guy Halferty 
was married in July to Miss Mary C. 
Anderson, of Pittsburgh. Whitney S. 
Hamnett was married to Miss Mary 
Pfeil on August 24th, and finally Gil­
bert A. Bell, of last year’s Civil En­
gineering Course, has quite recently 
been married to Miss Morse, of this 
city.* * *
It is with deep sorrow that the 
death of Joseph Gradwohl, Applied 
Industries, 1911, is recorded. Mr. 
Gradwohl was taken ill with typhoid 
fever just before Commencement last 
June and died on July 19th, 1911.* * *
F. E. Koethen, Science, ’08, is now 
with the International Acheson Graph­
ite Company, Niagara Falls, New 
York.

1912 BASEBALL CAPTAIN.
VAIL ELECTED.
Arthur Vail, left fielder on last year’s 
varsity nine, was elected captain by 
the “C” men for the season of 1912. 
Vail is a junior in the School of Ap­
plied Science, Department of Civil En­
gineering. He acted as field captain 
in the majority of the games of last 
season, owing to the absence of Capt. 
Moorhead. He was the most consist­
ent player on the team and will make 
a good leader for the coming season.

soldiers at your funeral?—Coming 
Nation.
A TIME-HONORED CONTEST.
The man who was passing the base­
ball grounds paused interestedly.
“What’s that row about over by the 
fence?” he asked of an undersized, 
spectacled lad who was looking on 
from a safe distance.
“Sir,” replied the boy sedately, “you 
no doubt heard of the age-old conflict 
between the haves and the have- 
nots?”
“Yes,” returned the puzzled inquir­
er, “but what------”
“Well, this is merely a little skirm­
ish between the have-nots and the 
have-knot-holes.”—Life.

The match was forthcoming—but 
nothing more.
“I do beleive,” said Robbie, “I ha’ 
left me tubacco to hame.”
“Then,” said Sandie, after a silence, 
“Ye micht as well gie me back me 
match.”—Success.

THE TARTAN3
APPLIED DESIGN ORGANIZES 
NEW OFFICERS ELECTED.
A meeting of the School of Applied 
Design for the election of officers for 
the coming year was held in Room 
223 D Monday, September 25, at 2 
o’clock. It was well attended by both 
Plebes and Upper Classmen, and an 
enthusiastic vote was the result.
Crosby, the only officer of last 
year’s organization remaining in 
school, presided. He instructed those 
unfamiliar with the intricacies of the 
ballot, and explained the oganization 
of the school. The nominations fol­
lowed. Disque was given the unani­
mous vote of the school for president, 
after which followed the election of 
the minor officers. The results are 
below: Vice President, Haaren; Sec­
retary and Treasurer, Hays; Senate, 
Crosby; Chairman, Fitzgibbon, Good 
and Hays; Tartan Representative, 
Fleming; Second Assistant Football 
Manager, Haaren; Historian, Hasness. 
Einstein, after a consideration of his 
abilities—physical and intellectual— 
was appointed tyler.
The chair was vacated by Crosby, 
after the counting of the ballots by 
Scott and Franks, accompanied by the 
student chorus, with such distinctly 
Design School ditties as “Around Her 
Neck,” “My Darling Sarah Jane,” and 
the Angel Chorus.
Disque then took charge of the 
meeting, expressing his thanks for the 
honor given him. Short talks and re­
marks by the other officers elected, 
followed. The Plebes were advised 
to organize, and urged to wear the 
red Plebe caps, if only to display the 
original idea of them—school spirit.
The system of the school senate 
was discussed by Crosby with an ear­
nest appeal to each student to con­
tribute his share toward making 
school discipline pleasant and success­
ful. The meeting adjourned at 3 
o’clock.
At a recent meeting of the newly 
elected senate, the past efforts of that 
institution were discussed. The ques­
tion of whether or not the senate 
should raise itself to be an adequate, 
useful organization, became the issue. 
Careful thought and opinions were 
given regarding the possibilities for 
successful student discipline and sug­
gestions for making stronger and 
more efficient this part of the school 
administration were made.
The senate has not in the past 
meant to each student all that it 
should. It is self government, for 
the student, by the student in theory. 
Practice should bring us close to the­
ory. The senate should become an 
instrument of redress, not a figure­
head. It is “up to” the senate to en­
force student rules, or the entire sys­
tem of student government will be 
supplanted by some new arrangement 
of discipline by the faculty, which 
would in time undoubtedly prove ob­
jectionable to both professors and stu­
dent body.
Without too serious results, the sen­
ate can be taken seriously. That the 
senate plans to enforce the rules, pri­
marily of the students’ own making,
should not be the signal for tyranny 
on the one side or anarchy on the 
other, but rather the square deal 
brought forward by earnest, helpful 
co-operation.
Just a few suggestions. Help to 
make the senate worth while in its 
efforts. We should familiarize our­
selves with the rules, not because they 
are rules, but because they are our 
own work. We should finish well 
what we have started. Student gov­
ernment is ours—we want its great­
est efficiency. Every man’s serious 
efforts will make it count.
SOPHOMORES ELECT OFFICERS
At a recent meeting of the Applied 
Science Sophomores the following 
men were elected as officers:
President..........................William Miller
Vice-President.. .Thos. W. Alexander
Secretary.................Albert E. Wood, Jr.
Treasurer.................Frank W. Roessner
Tartan Representative.G. Guy Kelcey * * *
The Sophomores wish to commend 
the incoming class upon their sports­
manlike behavior during the recent 
upheavals.* * *
The Sophomores should keep in 
mind their success in last year’s inter­
class athletics and plan for teams to 
represent them sufficiently far ahead 
so that no difficulties may be encoun­
tered from lack of practice.

4THE TARTAN
THE SCHOOL OF 
APPLIED INDUSTRIES
Classes Should Organize.
The time is now ripe for the organ­
ization of the different classes, and it 
will be well to bear in mind the fol­
lowing suggestions:
First of all, let us make a strong 
resolution and back it by our most 
strenuous efforts to make this a ban­
ner year for the Industries. Now this 
cannot be done unless every man in 
the School realizes that he has some 
part to perform, as officeholder or as 
voters. Do not, under any circum­
stances, begin by thinking that your 
vote does not count. Use care and 
judgment in the selection of class 
officers. Remember that it isn’t 
always the loudest talker who is the 
wisest leader. Select men who will 
have an altruistic spirit and not hold 
office simply for the sake of notoriety. 
Let every man attend, and take an 
active interest in the first election. 
Don’t throw your vote away for the 
sake of being with the majority. Vote 
for the man your common sense tells 
you should hold the office. And right 
here is a warning against what has 
been a mistake in former years. It 
is this: Your interest is as much 
needed after election as before. Be 
loyal to your class officers, heed their 
advice, give them all the assistance in 
your power, let every man attend a 
meeting when called and take ,an 
active interest in it; don’t allow the 
leadership to fall into the hands of a 
few, but let it be strictly democratic, 
and remember, your officers can do 
nothing without your support and co­
operation.
Class officers, realize the responsi­
bilities connected with your offices. 
See to it that all the members of your 
class are attending all the class meet­
ings, that they are obeying the rules 
of both class and particularly of the 
school, and that they are performing 
their class duties. Only in this way 
can the organization become secure 
and systematic.
The results of such a systematic 
organization are of inestimable value 
to the school. Through it the school 
becomes orderly, law-abiding; and 
loyalty to the School is developed to 
its greatest extent.
Another thing which should be sug­
gested here is the fact that we should, 
as soon as possible, form several clubs 
or societies, such as the Craftsmen’s 
Club, Mechanic’s Club, Draftsmen’s 
Club, etc., and many others to suit 
the tastes of the members composing 
them. When properly constituted, 
these Clubs are potent factors in the 
upbuilding of the School, both by the 
dispensing of knowledge and by the 
promotion of a healthful spirit of 
sociability among the student body.
If these suggestions are faithfully 
carried out we will, beyond a doubt, 
rise to a place of influence and re­
spect and become a dominant factor 
in the affairs of Tech. Let us strive 
for the goal.

M. M. C. S. NOTES.
There are ninety-nine new students 
this year in the Plebe class. This is 
the largest class that has ever entered.
In addition to the ninety-nine Plebes 
there are twelve girls who have en­
tered the Junior year under advanced 
standing. Ten of our last year’s grad­
uates have returned to take the teach­
ers’ course.* *
Of this year’s senior class, sixteen 
are taking the Household Arts course; 
thirteen the Secretarial course, and 
twelve the Dressmaking course.

PROFESSIONAL MEN.
—o—
Professional men are more to be 
pitied than scorned. It is a terrible 
thing to have to wander about the 
earth as an avowed receptacle of 
knowledge, as a repository of facts 
which must be true as well as import­
ant.
The principle trouble comes in that 
facts are treacherous, while profes­
sional men are loyal. Although facts 
are changing all the time, professional 
men are trying to live up to their 
diplomas. Having once learned a set 
of facts, they feel it is hardly fair for 
knowledge to move on and leave them 
behind. Some of them feel this so 
keenly that they become obstinate and 
absolutely refuse to listen to anyone 
with a new thought or a new fact.
Blessed is the man who does not 
profess too much, for he will have less 
to retract.—Life.

INTERESTING STATISTICS
Newspaper Man Figures Money Spent 
Yearly.
It occurred the other day to a news­
paper man, whose love runs to inter­
esting statistics in odd leisure mo­
ments, to figure out how much money 
is spent yearly in Pittsburgh by stu­
dents who come here for their educa­
tion.
His first investigation covered the 
large out-of-town student group that 
registers every fall at Tech. This 
group numbers considerably over six 
hundred students, and as it represents 
only those who come from outside the 
Pittsburgh district, the natural infer­
ence is that all these young men and 
women board in the city. The homes 
of 41 of them are in foreign countries, 
387 in the North Atlantic states, 53 
in the South Atlantic, 15 in the South 
Central, 7 in the Western and 96 in 
the North Central states.
The customary expenses of these 
students will fall into several general 
classifications, such as board and 
rooms, college books and supplies, 
clothes, fees, and personal incidentals. 
A careful estimate, based upon multi­
plying the number of out-of-town stu­
dents by the average expenses per 
student in each classification, yields 
the following interesting results.
Board and Rooms..........$144,240.00
Books and Supplies........ 10,500.00
Tuition and Other Fees. 24,606.00
Clothes................................ 36,060.00
Personal Incidentals.... 31,000.00
$246,406.00
This total does not include what is 
spent by members of the faculty, jior 
what the 1600 Pittsburgh students reg­
istered at Tech spend for college fees 
and supplies. From all these expendi­
tures, together with the funds spent 
in operating the Schools and in the 
average yearly construction work, it 
would appear evident that we add a 
cool million a year to Father Pitt’s 
pocket money.

THE DELICATE DISH.
Fullmer As a Cook.
Speaking of delicate things and deli­
cate operations it might be good to 
know that Fullmer in the capacity of 
Camp Cook at Camp Louise Carnegie, 
Glencairn, Pa.; undertook the making 
of “bean mash.” The recipe is as fol­
lows:
For six people.
One quart of navy beans, soaked 
over night, and boiled for one-half 
hour. When in this condition skin 
each separate and individual bean of 
the quart.
Had Fullmer completed his task 
the result, no doubt, would have been 
a very delicious dish. When he 
reached number 10 he suspected that 
he had struck a tedious task, when he 
overcame number 20 he knew that he 
had, and when number 30 appeared 
in “full dress,” he gave up in disgust.
If you do not believe this you can 
go to Glencairn and see the camp 
where it happened.

THE TABLES TURNED
It was time for baby girl to be in 
bed, but no amount of coaxing could 
take her. At last her father offered 
to lie on the bed till she fell asleep. 
Off she went ‘pick-a-back,” and the 
tired mother leaned back in her chair 
with a sigh of content ready for a 
hard-earned rest.
Ten minutes—twenty—half an hour, 
and she was wondering when father 
would be down, when all at once she 
heard a soft, stealthy “pit-a-pat.” 
Nearer came the steps, and then a lit­
tle, white-robed form with a tiny fin­
ger on her lip stood in the doorway.
“Hush, hush muvver,” she said, 
“I’se got farver to sleep.”—Tit-Bits.
A RARE CURIOSITY 
COMES TO LIGHT 
Mr. Taylor Obtains It.
News has just reached Pittsburgh 
from far-away Newfoundland that the 
great and growing Society of Grateful 
Carnegie Beneficiaries narrowly 
missed having, last summer, a new 
member of some fourteen tons avoir­
dupois. It is a matter of common 
knowledge that the fame of the Laird 
of Skibo has reached the uttermost 
parts of many lands, and that his 
image is carried in the hearts of a 
swarm of thankful mortals made up 
of heroes and heroines, peace advo­
cates and library recipients, peda­
gogues of the retired and to-be-re­
tired variety, and students by the, 
thousands who owe their education to 
his munificence, but the astonishing 
story has just come to light that his 
renown has even penetrated to the 
bottom of the sea, and that at least 
one denizen of the deep has carried 
Mr. Carnegie’s image about, in his 
head if not in his heart, for many, 
many years.
All of which is only one way of say­
ing that a monstrous 85-foot finback 
whale was captured about three miles 
off the coast of bleak Newfoundland 
two months ago, in Conception Bay, 
the outline of whose ear-drum bore a 
remarkable likeness to Mr. Carnegie’s 
features, as will be seen in the accom­
panying photograph.
This curiosity arrived in Pittsburgh 
a few days since in the luggage of 
Mr. John S. Taylor, a member of the 
Faculty, who spends the summers at 
his old home in the North Country. 
The white, shell-shaped oddity is a 
single piece of solid bone about as 
big as the egg of an ostrich. It meas­
ures five inches by three and a half, 
and weighs exactly one pound.
Mr. Taylor happened to be on the 
spot when the mountain of flesh that 
owned this auditory organ was towed 
ashore, and the discovery of the simi­
larity in its modelling to the facial 
characteristics of Mr. Carnegie was 
made when His Eighty-five Foot 
Majesty was going the inglorious way 
to the oil barrel, and to the pulverizing 
machine that converted his fourteen 
tons of bones and flesh into common, 
every-day fertilizing material. Into

A FENCE OF GUN BARRELS
How Revolutionary War Relics
Have Been Turned to Ac= 
count in Georgetown.
In the historic old suburb of George­
town, which lies just ajross Rock creek 
from Washington, there is an ancient building surrounded by one of the strangest fences ever seen, says Youth’s 
Companion. The fence is of iron, and 
the first thing the strangef exclaims when he sees it is: “Why it looks just
like a lot of gun barrels set Up on end!” 
And the stranger is right, for the fence 
is made of old gun barrels, relics of 
the Revolutionary War. A good many 
hundred of them went into the making 
of it, so that it is probably the most ex­pensive fence in the world. Its history 
is interesting.
Away back in 1814 while the War of 
1812 was still waging the British, under 
Gen. Ross, came up the Chesapeake bay 
and avoiding the forts that protected 
Washington by going Up the Patuxent 
river disembarked about 15 miles to the 
east. Hovering around the suburb of 
Bladensburg they threatened the capital. 
After the disastrous tjattle of Bladens­
burg, which resulted in a crushing de­
feat of the Americans, Washington lay 
open to the British. President Madison 
fled from the White House into Virginia and the victorious British took posses­
sion of the city.
At that time Washington itself was 
still a small affair, for it was not yet 
20 years old. In Georgetown, which was 
a much older city and the port of entry, 
whither came all commerce, the wealth 
and property of the District of Colum­
bia were centered. Its citizens, influ­
enced both by patriotism and by self- 
interest, immediately advanced a large 
sum of money to the government without 
security to prevent the complete sacking 
of the two towns. The British took the 
money and left.At the end of the war the government 
was nearly bankrupt and in no position 
to pay its unsecured debts. The officials 
high in authority, however, were mind­
ful of the debt that the country owed 
to these Georgetown capitalists and 
cast about for some method of recom­
pensing them.
Now at the government arsenal there 
had been collected a vast deal of old and 
useless military junk, the left-over ma­
terial of the Revolutionary War—old 
cannon, antiquated feuns and rifles and 
other martial aparatUs long gone out of date. These offiicals told the George­town creditors to go down and help 
themselves in satisfaction of the debts, 
of which there was no prospect of pay­
ment in any other way.
Among these wealthy Georgetown folk 
was one Reuben Daw, who had ad­
vanced many thousands of dollars in 
the dark days of the British occupation. 
He had just finished a fine residence and 
was in need of a handsome fence to 
complete the artistic effect of his house 
and garden. In rummaging through this 
old junk at the arsenal, seeking what 
might be of use to him, he found a 
quantity of ancient guns, e'ther captured 
from the British or turned in by the 
patriots after the Revolution. These he 
took in full satisfaction of his debt, 
painted the barrels and set them up as 
a picket fence about his n?w residence.
The house is now in a state of ruinous 
dilapidation, but the fence, although red 
with rust, is still in good condition. 
Throughout Georgetown there may still 
be found many relics of that payment 
in the form of old cannon set up for 
hitching posts, cavalry stirrups used for 
mud scrapers, and such like military ma­
terial long turned to peaceful use.

VIRTUES OF RAISIN BREAD
As Good as Cake to the Taste and 
Said to Be Better for 
the Health.
Incorporated with bread raisins consti­
tute a valuable diet and help outl the 
meat problem. It is stated that the raisin 
contains nearly 5 per cent protein and 
over 65 per cent carbohydrates and there­
fore is a very important energizing food.
The raisin has long had its place in the 
household, one day in cake, another day 
in pudding and frequently to end the
meal, with nuts as a companion. The 
digestibility of the raisin has commended 
itself because of the peculiar solubility of the grape sugar content.
Until the California farmer and fruit grower experimented with the raisin 
grape in the early fruit growing days the 
Malaga raisin was the standby in the 
market. But the farmer on his Califor­
nia fruit ranch, with the irrigation ditch to rely upon, soon developed the raisin grape to perfection.
Then followed the drying or curing of 
the grape under the sun’s rays and the 
invasion of the market. The evolution 
of the raisin industry was marked and steady, the output increasing each year, 
until last year it was estimated at 280,- 000,000 pounds.
The farmers in the valleys were pro­ducing more raisins than the country 
needed and the storehouses and grocers each fall had a good supply of the last 
year’s crop unsold. The only solution of the problem was either to raise fewer raisins or by educating the public to en­
large the market. Many methods were tried and proved successful, the persuad­
ing of housewives to use raisins in their 
bread enlarging the demand perhaps more than any other.
For invalids and children raisin bread 
is invaluable, says Life and Health. The 
simplicity of the loaf makes it an ideal substitute for the lard, butter, sugar, 
egg, cream and citron laden cake. It is 
therefore an important addition to the 
domestic menu, and the woman who has 
her children’s health at heart will see that at each baking two or three loave:! 
are well filled with raisins, kneading 
them in just before the loaves are put into the pans.
Those who have studied the raisin bread question in a scientific way advocate grinding up seeded raisins into a pulp and working it into the dough. But 
raisin pulp is perhaps the stickiest of substances, being filled with grape sugar; 
and to incorporate dough and pulped rai­sins thoroughly is a problem for only the 
most skilled and ingenious housewife.
But when raisins, ground and reduced 
to a pulp are worked into the loaf the raisin is completely lost in the crumb of 
the loaf. Such a loaf, instead of being 
white, is a rich brown color, really raisin color throughout. Carefully scan the 
crumb, and although it is sweet and with a delicious cooked raisin flavor, not a 
suspicion of the smallest part of even 
the skin of a raisin is in evidence, the fermenting process and the heat of the 
oven having perfectly done the work of incorporation.
How much flour and how many raisins 
should go into a loaf is more or less a 
matter of taste, some using one-fourth 
pound of raisins to each pound of flour 
and others using more. Each one must 
judge for herself. WTien experimenting 
with the pulped (ground) raisins a bread sponge might be set over night, the rai­
sins being added and the results noted. 
The addition of the dry flour in the morn­ing might solve the kneading problem.
ASSISTING THE FILIPINOS
The United States Government Is 
Now Making Direct Loans 
on Agricultural Land.
Efforts on the part of the Philippine 
commissioners to build up the agricultural 
industry in the Philippine Islands is 
meeting with slow, but none the less 
sure, success, says the Washington cor­
respondent of the New York Evening 
Post. The Agricultural Bank, which was 
proposed a few years ago for the pur­
pose of loaning money for the develop­
ment of agricultural land, met with little 
response on the part of the native Fili­
pinos, and the government itself is now 
making direct loans on such property. 
Under the present system it will loan 
a sum about equal to 60 per cent of the 
actual value of the lands to be im­
proved, tttere being no limit to the 
amount of lands which may be involved 
in the loan. In return, the government 
gets 6 per cent interest on its money. 
This system has been moderately suc­
cessful, but even yet has not stimulated 
the agricultural industry, as would be the 
case in the United States.
The greatest stimulant of agriculture 
which has taken place in the Philippines 
during American occupation has come 
from the enactment of the tariff law, 
which permits the annual importation 
of Philippine sugar and cigars into the 
United States free of duty, up to speci­
fied amounts. The result of this law

with respect to sugar was to double 
the price of raw sugar in the hands 
of the Philippine producers. This was 
a real boom to a sadly depressed industry 
and the sugar producers are now reach­
ing out for more land to cultivate. The 
tobacco industry was not in such a de­
pressed state at the time of the enact­
ment of the tariff law, for the tobacco 
producers always had a market for raw 
tobacco in Europe, and for their cigars 
in China. The effect on that industry 
has been an attempt on the part of the 
producers to better the quality of their 
produets. The importation of sugar and 
cigars from the Philippines has not yet 
reached the limit placed upon it by the 
Payne law, and will not do so for several 
years to come. Thus, one of the great 
objections made by opponents of the 
free entry of Philippine products into 
the United States, at the time the legis­
lation was under consideration, namely, 
the fear that Philippine products would 
swamp the markets of this country, 
has been discounted.
One of the great drawbacks to agricul­
tural prosperity in the Philippines has 
been the failure of landholders to register 
their ownership of lands. Before Ameri- 
mission, which was then the legislative 
can occupation, such a process was un­
known. In 1901, the Philippine com­
mission, which was then the legislative 
body of the islands, passed a law that 
anyone who remained in undisputed 
possession of a piece of land for 10 
years should be entitled to register his 
title to the land. The law is due to ex­
pire this month, and the result is that 
a lot of belated claimants to land about 
to pass into the hands of those who 
have occupied since 1901 have turned up. 
Under the law, unless the claimants can 
make good their claims ac once, the 
statute of limitations will intervene. 
They are clamoring to have the law ex­
tended so as to test their rights before 
the court. It was impossible to get 
legislation from the last Congress on this 
subject, and, unless the Philippine as­
sembly, which is to meet in a few 
months, takes some action, the claimants, 
who have had 10 years’ notice on which 
to act, will lose their claims.

NEW RESIDENT PHYSICIAN.
In this week’s issue we publish a 
photograph of Dr. W. L. Marks, our 
new resident physician. He was ap­
pointed last May to fill the position 
left vacant by the resignation of Dr. 
Orbin. Dr. Marks is a graduate of 
the University of Pennsylvania, and 
has been 011 most of the athletic teams 
of that institution. He is thus well
DR. WM. M. MARKS 
equipped for the treatment and advice 
for students of the local school. Al­
though he is in no way engaged for 
the purpose of coaching any of the 
teams, he will, without doubt, assist 
his team-mate Coach Ramsdell in his 
leisure moments. Dr. Marks' office is 
in the Field House, where he may be 
seen at any time by students needing 
attention and advice.

CARNEGIE TECH—INTERCOL­
LEGIATE CHAMPIONS.
Most of the students left school 
last June without knowing that Car­
negie Tech had won the intercolleg­
iate track championship of Western 
Pennsylvania and West Virginia for
1911. The meet took place at Grove 
City on June 3, and was competed 
by Westminster, Geneva, Washington 
and Jefferson, Allegheny, Grove City, 
and Carnegie Tech.
The contests were close, especially 
between athletes from Allegheny Col­
lege and our men. The final scores 
were Carnegie Tech 47%, Allegheny 
College 45, Washington and Jefferson 
23%, Westminister 21%, Grove City 
21, and Geneva 4 points.
Capt. Wait, Steinmetz, and Craw­
ford were the stars for Tech annexing 
30 points among them. Wait won both 
the mile and the two mile events 
setting a low mark of 11:02 for the 
latter. Boots won the broad jump | 
with a remarkable leap of 21 feet 1 y2 
inches.
Before adjourning for the summer 
the track team elected Edwin R. 
Boots, Jr., of New Brighton, Pa., cap­
tain for the 1911-12 year. Captain 
Boots is the best man for the broad 
jump that Carnegie Tech has ever 
had, and can also be relied upon in 
the weight contests to take points. He 
is a senior in the Civil Engineering 
department.
Capt. Boots has issued an early call 
for all track candidates to report this 
week for fall practice, and asks for a 
personal interview with all underclass­
men interested in athletic contests. 
Under his able leadership and the 
expert advice of Coach Ramsdell and 
Director McCulloch, every man in 
school should try some form of exer­
cise as a part of his college education.
The inter-school meet, competing 
for the Hammerschlag trophy, will be 
held in the fall instead of in the spring, 
as heretofore, if arrangements can so 
be made. The date for .this year’s 
meet has been set for October 21, the 
date of the first out-of-town football 
game. This means but two weeks’ 
practice for those wishing to compete, 
As a victory by the Science School 
will decide the trophy to be in their 
permanent possession, it is up to the 
students of the other two schools to 
see that all of their athletes come 
out.
Men from the schools will be en­
tered in the P. A. A. cross-country 
run held about December 1. Indoor 
meets will be held during the winter 
in the spring the usual dual meet, and 
with Pitt and other local colleges, and 
a dual meet with Western Reserve will 
be on the schedule.
With most of the old men back in 
! school and the accessions of new ma- 
' terial, Carnegie Tech should have a 
j busy and successful season.
When you have to prepare an ora­

SILICA FOR STANDARDS OF 
LENGTH.
Instead of using gold or platinum 
bars on which to mark the official 
standards of length, as of the yard or 
meter, a British scientist proposes to 
use silica, which is practically the 
same as ordinary sand.
Metals have usually the property of 
expanding or contracting with changes 
in temperature, and gold and platinum 
are no exception to the general rule. 
There is a metal called “invar,” a 
nickel-steel alloy containing 36 per 
cent of nickel, which preserves nearly 
invariable dimensions under ordinary 
temperature changes—hence its name. 
But invar has other physical proper­
ties which render it unsuitable for 
standard measures.
A silica length standard was re­
cently constructed in England, and 
showed to advantage under tempera­
ture tests, as its expansion per de­
gree Centigrade rise of temperature 
proved to be but one-twentieth that 
of platinum-iridium alloy which has 
hitherto been considered to be the 
best material to use for length stand­
ards.
The present model, which is the 
first of its kind, consists of a silica 
tube into the ends of which are fused 
plane parallel slabs of transparent sil­
ica. The under sides of these slabs 
are covered with a platinum deposit 
which is cut through with a ruling dia­
mond at the transverse lines defining 
the standard meter. These lines, 
which are beautifully clean-edged, are 
viewed through the slabs from above, 
and are thus seen to advantage.

Two of the more impressive sights 
of a railroad grading camp are the 
marvelous alacrity of the men in re­
sponding to the call for dinner and 
their unparalleled quickness in wrap­
ping themselves around their grub. 
During construction of the new lines 
of the Louisville & Nashville in Ken­
tucky, an old farmer furnished one of 
the grading camps with vegetables. 
He often arrived at the camp at meal 
time and was always greatly im­
pressed with the voracity of the men.
The work was hard and when the call 
for dinner was given every man made 
a rush for the table and the food dis­
appeared in quick time. One day a 
workman on his way to the table 
tripped on the root of a tree and fell. 
He lay all sprawled out making no 
attempt to rise. The farmer in great 
concern rushed to him. “Are you 
hurt, are you hurt?” he asked anx­
iously. “No,” answered the man. W7ell 
why don’t you get up and go to your 
dinner?” “No use,” returned the 
other, sadly, “It’s too late now.”—En­
gineering & Contracting.

Recently in Seattle in a cigar stand 
appeared the sign, “We give $15.00 for 
1909 Lincoln pennies.” No less a per­
son was attracted by this than Judge 
Watson. He walked up to the counter 
and laying down a penny triumphantly 
asked for $15.00. The clerk took the 
penny, examined closely, askecl if it 
were genuine, and after several min­
utes sighed and said he guessed it was 
good.
“Certainly it is,” answered the 
Judge. “Where is my $15.00?”
I “Where,” said the clerk, “are the 
other 1903?”—Life.
