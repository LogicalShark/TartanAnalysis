Work On Senior Ball 
Advancing; Tea Dance 
In Union 4:30 Thurs
, Clarence Darrow, eminent criminal 
; lawyer, who has the reputation for 
| never having lost a case to the gal- 
| lows, gave a lecture in Pittsburgh last 
i week. In a special interview for the 
; Tartan, he emphatically stated that 
j the epidemic of college suicides is 
I nothing to be concerned over because 
there are no more suicides today than 
j there were 50 years ago. 
j .When it comes to prohibition, Clar- 
I ence Darrow is obviously on the fence. 
He would neither state, one way or 
! the other, which way he was inclined.
| Imprudent as it may seem, a re- 
j porter asked the lawyer if he liked 
| to kid in the courts, which necessar­
ily angered him for the moment.
Yet Clarence Darrow, the lion of 
the lawyers, is not the harsh cliarac- 
I ter that he has been pictured. His 
; court fights ranging from Tennessee 
j to Chicago have mellowed him. Clar- 
! ence Darrow lias passed the half cen­
tury mark and is possessed of an en­
joyable humor. This fact more than 
manifested itself in the lecture the 
other evening by his simple similes.
This great lawyer was also asked 
if he preferred lecturing to pleading 
cases, at which he replied it was all 
the same. No doubt he considers 
monkey-trials in Tennessee -and lec­
turing in Poduulc as being somewhat 
of a similar nature.
So that this Solon of the Jazz Age 
now tours the country planting his 
seeds against criminal punishment, 
which may some day grow into big 
trees and so abolish the gallows and 
the electric chair.
The Y. M. H. A. must be thanked 
again for bringing such notable peo- 
pleuas Clarence Darrow to Pittsburgh. 
Their education program is indeed 
very profitable because it brings peo­
ple to Pittsburgh who would have no 
other way of getting here.
Thursday evening in the Union as 
usual. All members of the band who 
. have uniforms out are requested to 
turn them in at 7:00 p. m.-while the 
practice will start at 7:30. Manager 
Hill requests that all members be out 
promptly and turn in their uniforms 
early.
In case any of the new students, 
who are entering at the beginning of 
the second semester play band instru­
ments, they are cordially invited to 
come out Thursday night and practico 
with the regular members. For the 
benefit of the new men, the Kiltie 
Band offers a wonderful oppor­
tunity for traveling with the football 
team and gives an Activities Key af­
ter two years membership.

A.l.E.E. TO HEAR SPEAKER! 
FROM INSTRUMENT FIRM
The A. I. E. E. has been fortunate 
in obtaining a representative from j 
the Western Instrument Company as | 
the speaker in their next meeting to 
be held on Tuesday, February 7. The 
talk will be accompanied with a film 
illustration.
Additional talks will be given by 
two student members of the A. I. E. 
E. These talks will include some 
phase concerning the advancement in 
the Engineering world in the past- 
year, 1927. This meeting will be held 
in Room 11, Machinery Hall, at 7:30 
p. m. This meeting is open to every­
one. Freshmen interested in this 
field of engineering are cordially in­
vited.
Plans are being made by the com­
mittee in charge for the Electrical 
S’moker to be held in the middle of 
February. A definite date has not 
been set, but will be definitely known 
by next week. This smoker is being 
held under the auspices of the Eta 
Kappa Nu, electrical honorary frater­
nity. All electricals are cordially in­
vited. Special invitations are being 
extended to Freshmen who are inter­
ested in Carnegie's electrical courses. 
Notices will be posted as to the place 
and time of this smoker on the vari­
ous bulletin boards and in the next 
issue of this publication.
Plans for the Women’s Senior Ball 
to be given by the girls of the class 
of 1928 in both M. M. C. C. and the 
Arts College are being advanced 
steadily and much of the work neces­
sitated by this elaborate dance lias 
been cared for by the committees.
The Tea Dance which will be given 
in the Union next Thursday is being 
sponsored by the Ways and Means 
Committee, composed of Betty Calvin 
and Dot Smith and Alice Mclnnis, 
treasurer of the class, with the end 
in view of paying part of the expense 
of the Ball with the money made by 
the Tea Dance. The committee feels 
confident that the Tea Dance will be 
a highly successful affair, for they 
have spared no pains to secure attrac­
tive features. Owen's orchestra, well 
known and well liked by all Carnegie, 
students will furnish the music for 
the dancers. Prizes will be distri­
buted to the winners of a novel con­
test: couples in the circles painted 
on the dance floor when the music 
stops will be awarded the prizes. 
Even the tickets for the Tea Dance 
show the committee’s originality; 
they are white tags with tiny red 
hearts in the center. The tickets for 
the Tea Dance will be on sale today 
and tomorrow at the nominal price 
of thirty-five cents.
The Senior Ball is annually given 
by. the Seniors girls and is usually 
one of the high spots in the senior’s 
social calendar. This year the Ball 
will be given in the ballroom of the 
William Penn Hotel, where the most 
successful of the ’school dances have 
been held in the past. The orchestra 
has not yet been determined but in­
quiries have been sent to nationally- 
known dance orchestras and there is 
no doubt but that the peppiest and

butions amount to $18,500. This sum 
lias been received from many in­
dividuals and a few organizations. A 
few World War Veterans Adjusted

giate journalism fraternity. The pur­
pose of the contest is the stimulation 
of greater interest in university pub­
lications and the elevation of the 
quality of their editorials. If success­
ful, it. will" be made an annual event, 
with additional prizes later for other 
journalistic features. Collogo “com- 
i ics” are barred from the competition,

at 4 p. m. All students who have, not 
registered by that time will be re­
quired to pay the late registration fee 
of $1 per day, Saturdays and Sundays 
not included.
It is expected . that the number of 
registrants for the second semester 
will be about equal to the number 
who registered in September. Each 
year several students drop out at the 
termination or the first semester, but 
this loss is usually balanced by addi­
tional Freshmen and Special student 
registrants.
At present about 2,500 are enrolled 
in the Day School at Carnegie.

EXAMINATION TEAS HELD BY 
“Y” ARE MOST SUCCESSFUL
The Examination Teas given by the 
Y. W. C. A. last week, in the Faculty 
Parlors of Margaret Morrison, were 
most sucessfnl. After the examq the 
girlB would stop and have tea with 
the members of the “Y.” Nearly 200 
girls attended each tea. The last tea 
which was held Wednesday, January 
25, was the greatest success.
The “Y" Is going to sponsor several 
activities later in the season at which 
another such entertainment Is prom­ised.
The Women's Scholarship Organi­
zation of Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology will have a benefit perform­

available by the cancelling of the Arts 
Ball.
When it. was announced that thei'e 
was to bo no Arts Ball. The sopho­
mores wore quick to realize that, this 
strategic date should not be left un­
occupied, for after the strenuous men­
tal grind of examination period there 
is always a suddon relaxation and It 
seems almost a necossity to liavo 
some social function at, this time.
The dance Is to be no mean affair. 
Soveral good orchestras are now un­
der the consideration of the com­
mittee, but as yet no definite agree­
ments ' have boon reached, There 
will ho programs, and probably re­
freshments and decorations to make 
the danco a close rival of the Hop.
It should be noted also that music 
will bo furnished from nine until one, 
and ovoryono will have time to got 
their full evenings pleasure. Inasmuch 
as tills function is to partly fill tile 
place of the Arts Ball, there will bo 
some digression from the usual typo 
of dance, making the affair an ove­
rling of roal onjoymont.
At present the sophomore class Is j 
In debt, and Is taking this opportunity 
of cleaning its slate, so as to be .able | 
to havo uncrrtmpod social ovonts Its \
junior year. The price of admission 
for the dance is $1.75 per couple, well 
within the roach of everyone in spito 
of its proximity to the Prom.
“WHITEY” KAUFMAN BIG 
SUCCESS AT MEN’S PROM
Today (.lie Men’s Junior Prom is a 
thing of the past but fervent memor­
ies will continue t.o live In the minds 
of many of the students who attended 
this outstanding function of the year. 
The charming ballroom of the Pitts­
burgh Country Club lent an air of 
distinction £o the Prom that may 
only be secured in long rambling, 
low-ceilinged structures of the type 
of the Club.
Throughout the evening the danc­
ers were paying compliments to the 
music* maker of the occasion, “Whitey” 
Kaufman and his group of versatile 
musicians. The applause was vigor­
ous after each dance and all were 
sorry to see them pack up and leave 
after so many hours of entrancing 
music. At midnight the Grand March 
was started led by Ralph Hitchcock, 
President of the Junior Class in Arts, 
followed by the other Junior Class 
Presidents, members of the Junior 
Prom Committee, and finally by the 
rest o/ dancers.
At the conclusion of the march the 
favors were distributed, the favors 
which have been a topic for surmisal 
and discussion for weeks were exqui­
site sterling silver bracelets com­
posed of alternate large and small 
links which were attractively de­
signed. Careful observance by the 
students from now on will probably 
disclose these favors on the wrists of 
flie fair co-eds who attended tills an­
nual Junior, frolic.
Dinner was served immediately 
after the Grand March filthough some 
had eaten before duo to the lack of 
accommodations. Fruit salad, hard 
rolls, (lellclous Ico, croam, served in 
molds,' French pastry, and coffee were 
served.
The attendance at this year’s Junior 
Prom was higher than that of last 
year’s Prom. This year’s committee 
desires to make the announcement 
that financially the 1928 Prom did not

With the Women's Junior Prom on 
February 24 but little more than three 
weeks away, final arrangements for 
this annual formal are rapidly ap­
proaching the stage of completion. 
An orchestra has been settled upon, 
favors are under consideration, the 
dinner has been decided and location 
is to be at the University Club.
With Bob MacGowan’s orchestra in 
the pit, the Junior girls havo secured 
some musical ontertainers of abilitty 
and variety, musicians who have 
found favor not only with the students 
of Penn State College, but also 
those studonts of Carnegie who havo 
attonded the Beaux Arts Ball of last 
year. After consideration by the com­
mittee In charge, It was decided to 
havo a spvoral course dinnor to bo 
servod at. 11:30; contracts for this 
dinner havo been let to the Unlvorsity 
Club caterers. The nature of tho 
favors is, of course, not yet discerni­
ble; it is evident they will be aa 
unique, as decorative and as utili­
tarian as usual. They will bo dis­
tinctly for tho men whom tho girls 
bring. Dormitory girls will bo grant.- 
od a special respite of time until 2:00 
o'clock for this affair.
Preliminary assessment, pasteboards 
have been Isnuod a few weeks ago. 
The initial price Is five dollars, ¡Col* 
lowod by a second assessment of flvo 
dollars and a final exchange ticket 
for throe dollars. The second series 
of tickets, obtainable from represen­
tatives of the various departments in 
Margarot Morrison and Arts, will ho

NIGHT FEBRUARY 14 
NEARLY COMPLETE
One Hour of Carnegie Tech 
Entertainment From 
Station KDKA
Plans for Carnegie Tech Iladlo 
Night on Tuesday, February 14, when 
the students will be on the air for an 
hour’s broadcast of music and what 
not from ^Station KDKA, are going 
along beautifully. A committee head­
ed by Professor Robert B. Lelghou is 
holding weekly meetings to outline 
program details and if the enthusiasm 
that Is being shown by the members 
is any indication, the broadcast Is 
bound to be a success.
Unfortunately, there Is scarcely 
anything further in connection with 
the program uetails to give you in ad­
dition to what was announced in last 
week's Tartan. S’everal new ideas 
have been adopted but we can not be 
definite enough in regard to the pro­
gram numbers just now to make a re­
port worth while.
The suggestion about organizing 
alumni parties to receive the program 
is still good, however. Buddy Over­
end, as executive secretary of the 
Alumni Federation, has been given a 
place on the program to send greet­
ings to the alumni all over the coun­
try. And won’t it send a few tickles 
up and down alumni spines to have 
him send specific messages of greet­
ing to some of the clans that he knows 
in advance are parked around the 
loud speaker waiting for familiar 
voices from Dear Old Tech?
The program time remains un­
changed. It will begin at 10 p. m. 
Tuesday night, February 14, from 
Carnegie Music Hall. The stage will 
be pretty well filled up with the sym­
phony orchestra, the Kiltie Band, the 
Men’s Glee Club, and the various "ar­
tists” who will be presented in spe­
cialties. Besides these, the committee 
will have to find room somewhere 
for the Bach Choir of about 50 voices.
Listen for the Bag Pipes Tuesday, 
the 14th, and if you find it difficult to 
hum a tune to the strains of the pipes, 
you’ll all have a chance to join in the 
chorus when the band strikes up with 
"Dear Old Tech.”

$600 Given To Board 
From Dollar Day Fund
This Sum With Board’s Gift 
Will Amount to $3670 by 
the Year 1946
January 24, 1928. 
Clarence Overend, Alumni Executive 
Secretary,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Mr. Overend:
Your letter of the 23rd came to 
hand, with its accompanying check of 
$600, just in time lor acceptance by 
our committee at its monthly meeting 
held yesterday, and it gave our meet­
ing a very jubilant tone.
I have passed the check on to 
Chairman Church, wrho will acknowl­
edge it for the board of trustees, but 
in the meantime, I want you to know 
what a vast amount of encouragement 
it gave the committee in our efforts 
for the 1946 Fund.
Thanking you and the Federation, 
j through you, for this very evident in-
DO YOU REALIZE
That Pitt has asked her alumni and 
students to glvo. one dollar-a week for 
11 vo years, and it Loyalty Bond Is but 
twenty cents a week—and every dime 
paid now brings sixty cents in twenty 
years?
What an apportunity this is? Un- 
hoard of in the history of American 
education.
That it also moa,ns you aro free 
from alumni dues—full-ficdgod "lifer?”
That many graduates owe every­
thing to their start at Carnegie, but 
are robbing tlio future generations of 
students of the same opportunity?
That by talking Carnegie • • tolling 
the world of this wonderful oppor­
tunity of bringing $8,000,000 to Pitts­
burgh and Carnegie—outside interest 
and support can be obtained? Don’t 
miss an opportunity to boost.
That. the annual teaching cost at 
Carnegie is approximately $820,000?
That the plant operation mainten­
ance charges and general expenses 
are about $200,000 a year?
That photographic aerial views (7x9 
inches) of the campus, will be mailed 
to'any alumnus upon receipt of forty 
cents? L.
That you, as an alumnus in good 
standing, should get some of your 
classmates in?
That trees have been planted every­
where on the campus?
That a life member can become a 
Loyalty Bond holder by paying ten 
dollars a year for live years?
That everyone derives something 
of value from college besides an edu­
cation? How about your associations 
at Carnegie?That the annual cost of administra­
tion at Carnegie is $140,000 annually?

Dr. R. M. Ihrig,
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
My Dear Dr. Ihrig: —
Many thanks for your kind letter 
and the pleasant and touching remi­
niscences which it brought tp my 
mind so vividly. Yes, it is the same 
Constaninides, your student in Ger­
man, only increased slightly in height 
I was almost the limit already at 
that time) and considerably in avoir­
dupois.
My activities since I graduated 
from C. I. T., in brief, have been as 
follows: For some time I was con­
nected with, the Westinghouse Com­
pany at East Pittsburgh and then I 
moved to Chicago where I worked 
part time in a small industrial firm, 
devoting what was left of it taking 
graduate courses leading to an M. Sc. 
at the University of Chicago. I ob­
tained that degree after two years, 
my thesis being "Study of the Fine 
Structure of Magnesium Spectrum.'' 
After this, and a brief visit to Pitts­
burgh and C. I. T., on which occasion 
I did not have the pleasure of seeing 
you. I acted for a period of about two 
years as Consulting Physicist in a 
Chicago firm and then went back 
again to the University as assistant 
while working for my Doctor’s degree. 
At present I am with the Crane Tech­
nical School and Junior College (it 
belongs to the Chicago Public School 
system) as instructor of physics. My 
position there is, however, at least at 
present, temporary, as I am taking 
the place of a man with a year’s leave 
of absence. Needless to say, I am 
looking for something better and more 
permanent and will be very grateful 
for -any assistance, information, or ad­
vice that you could give me towards 
that end. In this connection I can­
not help but feel that, in spite of my 
good scholastic record, recommenda­
tions, and papers published, my ad­
vance is not as rapid as I was justi­
fied in expecting, owing, perhaps, to 
my foreign birth .and lack of connec­
tions.
Strange to say that, although I knew 
you were a Ph. D., I never dreamed 
you were from the University of Chi­
cago, as I thought you had it from some 
German University. It will interest 
you to know that the German studies 
I started with you I continue to culti­
vate and spend about ten minutes 
every day reading from German scien­
tific books. It has been of great use 
to me.
Kindly give to Professors Work and 
Dennison, and other members of the 
faculty, my best regards. Hoping that 
I will have the pleasure of hearing 
from you again, I beg you to accept 
the expression of my most distin­
guished regards and considerations.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed)
PH. A. CONSTANTINIDES.

Dies After Long Illness
Harry A. Madison, a graduate of the 
Mechanical Engineering Department 
in 1917, died at the Battle Creek 
Sanitarium at Batle Creek, Michigan, 
on December 26, 1927, after a pro­
longed illness. On October 6 he had 
gone to his home at Cambridge, Ohio, 
-where he stayed for about two months 
and then went up to the Battle Creek 
Sanitarium r where he stayed about six 
weeks before he died.
Madison had enlisted during the 
war, and was called out before the 
graduation exercises in 1917. He 
served during the war in the Naval 
Aviation. After the war, he was with 
John A. Stephens, Consulting En­
gineer in Cleveland, and later with 
the American Steel and Wire Com­
pany in Cleveland. He then went .to 
Pittsburgh with the Carnegie Steel 
Company after which he came to 
Youngstown with the Pennsylvania- 
Ohio Power and Light Company, 
where he had been for the last two 
and a half years as Assistant Super­
intendent of Power Production.
Madison was not only an excellent 
engineer who was highly regarded by 
all the officials of the company but he 
had a wonderful personality and was 
known and liked by everyone with 
whom he came in contact.
Delco Reray Corporation 
To Interview Seniors Feb. 9
Mr. Carl L. Storck of the Delco- 
Remy Corporation will be on the cam­
pus on February 9 to interview 
Seniors who will graduate in June. 
Mr. Storck is coming on from Ander­
son, Indiana, and his interview will 
be of interest to seniors in the Com­
mercial, Mechanical, Electrical, and 
Works Management courses.
Mr. Kristof, ot the employment bu­
reau, has also requested that all 
seniors who are interested in foreign 
service fields, stop at the employment 
office and see him, as he has some­
thing which will be of interest to any 
such seniors.
Once more the office requests that 
all seniors get their employment 
blanks in at once. There are as yet 
about 30 per cent of the blanks still 
out, and it is impossible for the em­
ployment office to co-operate with the 
seniors if they are not willing to co­
operate with the office in this small 
matter.
Further notices of interviews will 
be published in the Tartan from time 
to time.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 31, 1928THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
The Bagpipe
The question asked this week 
was: “What do j-ou think about ex­
aminations?”
Sarah Riegler, Senior in Home 
Economics: “I don’t think very
much of them. In some subjects they 
are all right, but in a lot of subjects, 
they shouldn’t be held. Certain 
courses in outside reading should 
not be examined, because the matter 
is not permanent. However, in some 
courses, there are a lot of facts- which 
should be learned and on which the 
student should be examined.
G. U. Cleeton, Professor of Psy­
chology: “An examination that thor­
oughly examines is absolutely indis­
pensable. If it isn’t a thorough ex­
amination, it is unfair to the student. 
The longer the examination is in the 
number of topics, the fairer it is. If 
I were to pick out any recent move­
ment in colleges, it would be the pos­
sibility of substituting examinations 
for a certain amount of class routine. 
The examinations ought to be cumu­
lative, and not placing top much im­
portance on a final examination.
‘If a final examination were long, 
it would provide a mark which would 
be similar to the average of several 
intermediate quizzes. I believe in ex­
aminations, but I don’t believe in a 
short examination. S'ome examina­
tions are not reliably scored because 
of their form. The only fair examina­
tion is one in which the teacher does 
not have to judge whether the answers 
are right or wrong. General ques­
tions ought not to be given in exam­
inations, but should be assigned as 
class exercises.”
B. W. Moore, 'Senior in Mining En­
gineering: “I don't think they do any
good. I think a Professor has a very 
good idea about what the student 
knows, and the final examinations are 
a reiteration of his opinion.”
George Camp, Sophomore in Works 
Management: “If there weren’t any
examinations a man would work the 
whole year around, but with examina­
tions, he loafs the whole semester 
until the exams and then tries to 
make it up and flunks. I attended 
Allegheny High where they didn’t have 
any finals, and everyone had to keep 
his grade above passing. The final 
grade was the mark- of the term, and 
it worked out all right.”
William T. Kirby, Freshman in 
Drama Department: “I think they’re
a mighty good thing. A lot of stu­
dents don’t study most of the year 
until the exams come, and even if 
they do cram, they learn something 
about the course. There should be 
only one long examination at the end 
of the year and not a lot of monthly 
quizzes, for the student should be ex­
amined to find out if he has a gen­
eral idea of the subject.”
Columbus, Ohio — (Intercollegiate 
Press and Ohio State Lantern)—Sub 
zero nights will not find the young col­
legiate gentleman shivering on the 
doorstep while saying his adieu to an 
appreciative co-ed. No more will his 
words be /frozen upon utterance, re­
gardless of his attempts to make them 
otherwise. Money which was to have 
been spent for ear muffs may now be 
expended on further entertainment 
for the girl friend, or stock in a re- 
- frigerator factory.
Only for a paltry five or ten min­
utes may the men linger in the front 
hall to say good night. 'Such was the 
decision made by the Ohio S'tate uni­
versity house presidents.
Dean Esther Allen Gaw expressed 
the belief that the co-ed is the party 
disposed to linger on the doorstep or 
in the vestibule. The men should 
note this, she said, and not allow 
themselves to be led to the extent of 
breaking down their health as a re­
sult of late hours.
Minneapolis, Minn.—(IP)—Dieting 
has become a fad at the University of 
Minnesota despite the accusation that 
the vast majority of people- over-eat, 
according to Dr. H. D. Lees, assistant 
director of the Health Service.
So much harm has resulted from 
self-appointed diets and incorrect ex­
ercises, that the Health service is now 
operating a Nutrition clinic to help 
the student who is under weight or 
over weight.
The Nutrition clinic puts the stu­
dent through a complete physical ex­
amination and if he is found without 
serious defect he is allowed to fol­
low out a system of supervised diet­
ing.
“A complete physical examination 
should precede any attempt to outline 
a diet for the average individual,” 
said Dr. Lees, “Every person needs 
individual treatment, and to follow a 
standard diet results in actual harm.’’
It has been found that women are 
more concerned about their weight, 
as a rule, than men. The majority of 
the girls at Minnesota are trying to 
keep their weight down, records 
show. Many girls who are five per 
cent to 10 per cent under weight are 
even trying to reduce.
Scientific Investigations Show That 
Pittsburgh is Not~the “Dirtiest” City
No longer is Pittsburgh the “dirt­
iest” city in the country. According 
to the results of a scientific investi­
gation quoted by Professor Samuel E. 
Dibble of the .Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, both St. Louis and Cin­
cinnati are “smokier” than Pittsburgh.
Investigations of 23 American cities 
made by H. C. Murphy, an eugineer of 
Louisville, Kentucky, showed, accord­
ing to Professor Dibble, that St. 
Louis with 17,600 dust particles per 
cubic foot, has the largest dust count 
in this country. Cincinnati with 
16,770 dust particles per cubic foot is 
second, and Pittsburgh is third with 
16,100. Detroit has 15,300, and Chi­
cago has 14,000. Boston which has 
only 5,300 dust particles per cubic 
foot, is, according to Murphy’s investi­
gations, the cleanest city in the 
country.
That Pittsburgh has "relinquished” 
its rank as the dirtiest city is attri­
buted by both Murphy and Dibble to 
the “strenuous methods in smoke 
abatement.”
Professor Dibble, however, who 
holds the Theodore Ahrens Professor­
ships in Plumbing, Heating and Ven­
tilating at Carnegie Tech, believes that 
that much remains to be done both 
here and elsewhere in order to offset 
the increasing death rate due to con­
taminated air. Smoke, gases, and 
other impurities in the- air constitute 
the chief causes for the increasing 
death rate due to disease spread 
through air, he points out in urging 
legislation that will “speed up” the 
progress of sanitation.
“Although we cliave, by means of 
intelligent legislation, cut down the 
death rate as far as the purity of our 
?ood and water supplies are concerii- 
¡d,” he observed, “we have done very 
'ittle to purify the air, and this is the 
principal factor now delaying the pro­
gress of sanitation.’’
"Ninety per cent of the housewives 
of the country are being ‘gassed’ in 
their homes,” he declared in pointing 
to the menace of carbon monoxide 
gases’ generated by hot water heaters 
and gas^toves that are not equipped 
with flu^s\ Smoke thrown off by 
bitumino.u^coal used for househeat- 
ing and generation of power in manu­
facturing plants is another menace, 
he added, that is affecting the health 
of residents in large communities.
"Examine the lungs of a person 
from a district such as St. Louis, 
Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Chicago and 
other cities where soi't coal smoke is 
polluting the air, and you will find 
them like ebony,” he suggested.
"While smoke abatement regulations 
are doing some good in these cities,” 
he said, “the abatement law should be 
more rigidly administered.”
Faulty plumbing systems in houses 
are constantly throwing of sewage 
gases and vermin into homes to in­
crease the hazard of deadly disease, 
he warns. "Garbage, refuse disposals, 
—all these and many others are a 
major cause in the death rate in­
crease,” he maintains.
“A study of death rates caused by 
diseases entered the body through 
each of the three elements—food, 
water, and air—reveals,’,’ Professor 
Dibble continued, “that the death 
rate per thousand from disease germs 
carried by food has in the past few 
years gradually decreased. Sanitary 
laws, pure food laws, and laws re­
quiring sanitary conditions at the 
source of food gathering, handling, 
packing and shipping have brought 
about this improvement.
“The death rate per thousand 
caused by disease germs'which enter 
the body through drinking water has 
gradually decreased, also. This is a 
direct result of purifying all the water 
which is used. It is interesting to 
reflect that when sanitary engineers 
planned to supply large cities with 
water free from harmful bacteria they 
were considered men of impracticable 
ideas. Today streets are flushed with 
this purified water and nobody thinks 
anything of it.
“But when we consider the third 
element, air, conditions are far 
different. The death rate per thou­
sand caused by disease germs which 
enter the body through the air we 
breathe has gradually increased. The 
solution to the menace of impure air 
is to purify all of the air we breathe. 
This can be done by keeping out of 
the air that which contaminates it. 
In a great many houses there are 
plumbing systems which, although 
‘tight’ ten or fifteen years ago, are 
now imperfect and ‘leaky’, and are 
throwing off sewer gas, drain air and 
vermin into the house.”
Although the consumer today un­
complainingly pays water bills and ex­
tra prices for purified food, Professor 
Dibble observed, it is difficult to per­
suade the consumer that he should 
be prepared to spend money for bet­
ter sanitation. # Plumbing codes should 
be more% strict, he said, and plumbing 
contractors should be required by law 
to pass rigid examinations. “Plumb­
ing systems should be tested on an 
average of every five years,”' he added, 
“and smoke abatement should be 
more rigidly administered.”
CHIMNEY SWEEPS VISIT» 
CARNEGIE FRATERNITIES
The Inter-collegiate chimney sweeps 
in a tour of the universities and col­
leges throughout the United States 
stopped at Carnegie Tech last week 
after a short stay at the University 
of Pittsburgh. This duet, Johnny 
Lenney and Paul Buckley, both of 
Camden, N. J., have traveled from 
Massachusetts to California and 
through most of the states cleaning, 
chimneys of fraternity and sorority 
houses and entertaining the occupants 
of such houses.
This odd pair of minstrels were no 
doubt seen by most of the students. 
They wore dirty clothes, black ear 
muffs and had faces almost as black. 
Lenney, the older of the two, was be­
decked with a stove pipe hat. He 
claims that he has been at this work 
since 1918 when he was released from 
the Canadian army.
Buckley, it seems, does most of the 
work while Johnny Lenney, salesman, 
singer, yodeler, dramat, poet, and 
chimney sweep, does the entertaining. 
At the Pitt basket ball game on Jan­
uary 20 he sang and yodeled between 
the halves and received $5.73, nearly 
all in pennies and nickels.
One of his late masterpieces in 
poetry he calls Carnegie Tech’s Com­
mencement.
We’re the students of Carnegie Tech, 
So merry and so free (?)
In the commencement of life 
To think seriously.
As we go out on the pathway of life 
To make our name,
We will he true to our Alma Mater 
And gladly bear her name.
As the sages of the ages 
Fought on for their fame,
We the students of Carnegie Tech 
Will ring out her name.

Hoover Sends Pres. Baker 
1¡ Letter Of Commendation
Doctor Baker has been honored 
with a letter recently from the Secre­
tary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, 
in which he commends the work the 
President has been doing in connec­
tion with the Coal Conference, and 
approves the suggestions he has made 
in the treatment of the coal question. 
Mr. Hoover regards the coal confer­
ence as of utmost' importance and 
thinks the question of the waste-pro- 
duct and by-product in coal produc­
tion and consumption is one of the 
dominant ones in all American indus­
try. It is in the interest of this In­
ternational Conference on Bituminous 
Coal that the president is to leave 
shortly for Europe.
Syracuse, N. Y. — (Intercollegiate 
Press and Syracuse Dally Or.ange)— 
The fact that some students crib in 
examinations is not necessarily a, mat­
ter of moral terpitude but probably 
just a sign of unadjusted habit pat­
terns, thinks Professor Mary E. John­
son, of the department of sociology at 
Syracuse university.
Seeing a person cheat usually 
arouses in the observer a feeling of 
anger and disgust, but not so with 
Professor Johnson. She is inclined to 
think that the early training of the 
cheater has developed a warped sys­
tem of habit patterns; that cheating 
is usually developmental retardation, 
and she explains her idea thus:
“A child learns Dy borrowing ideas., 
He is constantly asking questions and 
often unconditionally accepts the 
answers given. Persons are pointed 
out to him as saints or dinners, and 
by this method he gradually learns to 
distinguish between right and wrong. 
Thus far in life the child has thought 
little for himself. If his bringing up 
has been neglected hy the parent the 
chances are strong that the child has 
formed wrong habit patterns.
"With adolescence the youth begins 
to reason for himself, weighing his 
problems in the light of past experi­
ence. It may be that he has never 
left his borrowing, dependent habit of 
learning. Hence follows the leaning 
on his companions for what he learns, 
this resulting in cheating.
‘‘A college student should have suf­
ficient poise and character to stand 
on his own merits. He should be 
able to say on the examination paper, 
‘I do not know the answer to the 
question since I neglected to cover 
the material assigned.’ If he does 
not have this poise he may by self- 
discipline school himself into a better 
adjustment of his, habit patterns.”
Professor Ely has been appointed 
by Governor John S. Fisher as a mem- 
¦ber of the State Senate Sanitary Wa­
ter Commission.
NEW YORK CO-EDS REBEL! 
AGAINST STINGY ESCORTSMusic Notes
"Co-eds war on escorts who give 
‘Dutch Treats.’ Form club and 
swear they’ll never pay another soda 
check when out with college men but 
latter aren’t bit perturbed.” (From 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette).
New York, January 20.-r—Nine Co­
lumbia University co-eds, stung by re­
peated refusals of their escorts to 
pay dinner or soda, checks and'thea­
ter bills, have formed a club and 
sworn by all the eternal Gods that 
henceforth they will not open their 
pocketbooks when out with college 
men.
The movement for financial equali­
ty has steadily gained strength on 
the Morningside campus for the past 
two years and in certain circles the 
“Dutch” system -is the rule.
“We just had to rebel some time,’’ 
said Miss Bettie Fell, president of 
the as yet unnamed revolutionary or­
der. “How can a poor college girl 
on an allowance be expected to pay? 
When mother was a girl a man who 
was in love was willing to make any 
sacrifice, but nowadays they talk 
about economic independence and the 
right to vote. ' Now I ask, what has 
that to do with who shall pay for a 
hot fudge sundae?”
But the men of the university seem 
not in the least perturbed. They 
quote the wheeze about the number 
of fish in the ocean and continue to 
economize on their dates.

NEW LABORATORY IS
PLANNED BY GAS MEN
The gas industry is enthusiastic 
over the results secured from the ap­
pliance testing program as carried out 
by the American Gas Association 
Testing Laboratory at Cleveland, Ohio, 
to the extent that it is spending $150,- 
000 to erect a permanent new home 
for the Laboratory.
The active support of gas and man­
ufacturer companies and the public 
has created the necessity for a new 
and larger building in which to con­
duct the tests for safety, efficiency, 
and durability, according to R. M. Con­
ner, the Laboratory’s director. Al­
ready, in the two and a half years 
of its existence, 7,198 different types 
of gas-burning appliances have been 
tested and approved, and there are 
probably more than 40,000 models yet 
to be tested.
The new laboratory will be heated 
entirely with gas, and refrigeration 
service will also be given by gas.
Mars and Its Safe|r 1tea
The naval observatory says that 
both satellites of Mars move around 
that planet in the same direction; but 
the inner satellite completes one revo­
lution In less time than Mars makes 
one rotation and, therefore, seen from 
Mars, it appears to move in the op­
posite direction to the outer satellite.

Thomas Hardy, The Novelist, 
Eulogized By The "Nation”
The death of Thomas Hardy closes 
a long and famous career, and re­
moves a literary figure s.o familiar 
that he had begun to seem almost im­
mortal. If Hardy as poet has been a 
subject in recent years for the young­
er critics to grow excited about, 
Hardy as novelist was the theme of 
their grandfathers. Few careers have 
been so copious or so interesting; 
none, porhaps, has presented the 
spectacle of an author practicing the 
art of prose fiction for thirty years 
and then for thirty more devoting 
himself to the production of a vast 
body of important verse. How much 
he was a world figure it is difficult 
just now to say. There were many 
complaints while he lived concerning 
his neglect by the Noble Prize com­
mittee, and it is certain that lie out­
shone some of the European writers 
who received the prize. But he may 
turn out to have been so purely 
English that he called for no recogni­
tion outside of that region to which 
he consecrated himself, those limits 
within which he so steadfaastly work­
ed.
Hardy/ died, as 'lie was born, and 
lived most of his eighty-seven years, 
iu Dorsetshire. This fidelity to a 
single locality which he made known 
as ‘Wessex" has had much to do with 
our notion of him as an author 
possessing in a peculiar degree the 
quality of consistency; though it is 
probably not true that lie was more 
consistent with himself than other 
great artists in words. Hardy’s ad­
vantage was that his universe had 
geographical character; it had naame, 
color, form, and a history, so that we 
could not have missed its features if 
we would. And in general the ad­
vantage of this man who began by 
being an architect.was tl\at he knew 
how to draw his subjects, whether 
they were landscapes or men, with 
hard, sharp lines, all the more unfor­
gettable because a mysterious light 
played over them.
The fascination of Hardy’s novels, 
and later of his poems, for at least 
two generations of British and Ameri­
can readers is something of which 110 
one even now may know the measure. 
How many more generations there 
will be to fall under his spell Is an 
Interesting question. Doubtless hid 
greatest value will prove to have been 
for us who were his contemporaries, 
who lived in the world he bent his 
strange eyes upon, who met more or 
loss at first hand the materials which 
lie shaped so bitterly and so doggedly 
to his vision. To the extent at any 
rate that this vision was condi­
tioned by purely nineteenth-century 
attitudes and dlscoverlos, Hardy was 
for our time. How much he was for 
all tlmo—how much he was a man 
whoso point of view can bo compre­
hensible and important always—time 
alone will toll.

CHANGES IN PERSONNEL SAYS AMERICAN WOMEN DO
MUST BE CONSIDERED IN NOT COMPARE WITH FRENCH
ORCHESTRAL COMPARISONS | WOMEN AS TO PERSONALITY
Concerning orchestral tone, ques­
tion arises now and then iii places 
where men and women of music 
meet. Especially does this happen In 
a week like that just past, when three 
organizations having conductors of 
diverse talents and differing methods 
give performances on consecutive 
nights. Let the Philharmonic Orches­
tra appear in Carnegie Hall under Mr. 
Mengelberg’s direction on Wednesday, 
the Boston Symphony under Mr. 
Koussevltzky on Thursday and the 
New York Symphony under Mr. 
Busch on Friday, he who has heard 
one is likely to compare observations 
with him who has heard another; and 
the person who has had the privilege 
of attending the concerts of all three 
groups of players is pretty sure to 
:idd a word, clarifying, or perchance 
complicating, the discussion.
Query inevitably darts forth from 
a corner, by the time half or more 
of the room becomes involved in the 
talk, regarding the particular orches­
tra which has always been the most 
renowned for its tone; in this case, 
the B. S. O.
Now the B. S. O., anybody need 
only read the names of the members 
inside the covers of the ink (is that 
really the color?) program-book to be­
come aware, has been almost com­
pletely reconstituted in the last 10 
years. Inasmuch as a reputation can 
long outlast a personnel, it is noth­
ing strange if people think of the B. 
S. O. of 1917 when listening to that 
of 1927. An aural illusion; for the B. 
S. 0.‘ of Koussevitzky so remotely re­
sembles in sound that of Muck as 
fairly to imply a new definition of the 
word, “orchestra." The B. S. O. has 
no such swirl and rush of string torn 
is it used to have; it lias no such 
startling brilliance of wood-wind tone, 
either; and no such rafter-raising 
power of brass. Changed, and on the 
whole demonstrably for the better 
That former glory of strings was all 
first violins; second violins were in­
terior and violas were of scarcely any 
igniflcance. Cellos were what pros­
pectors call “spotted,’ that is to say.
? hey ranged from excellent at the for­
ward desks to doubtful as you went 
back. The basses were unresonant, 
lion-communicative. Today, the B. S 
O. possesses a string choir of five 
speaking, equalized voices. The first 
violins no longer are the whole show 
and the cellos—aren’t they impressive 
in the allegretto of Beethoven’s Sev- 
ontli Symphony! The B. S. O. string 
section never showed such energy of 
attack and' such speediness Vf re­
sponse as they do at present; and 
how in the world do the men so in­
variably know what Mr. Koussevitzky 
means by that strange beating of his? 
They do; they understand his stick, 
and that is enough.
The B. O. S. woodwind choir is just 
where it belongs, a harmony balanced' 
against the strings and blended with 
them; no assertion of the solo Idea to 
the disturbance of the main now of 
the orchestral song. The brasses 
too, are In the color scheme, clear h’ 
tint yet never too pervading. The 
drums, lot it, be confessed right here, 
are too loud in the B. S. 0., as in the 
general run of American orchestras.
Suppose a fair number of partici­
pants in the conference, someone is 
sure to remark upon the rich tone of 
the Philharmonic. The sonority ol 
this great group, instituted upon a 
foundation^ of 10 double-basses, Is 
grand sometimes alm&st to awfulness. 
And yet the Philharmonic, with all 
its resource—fine players and pre­
sumably excellent instruments—can 
be terribly matter-of-fa^t in its in­
terpretations. Only place on Mr. 
Mengelberg’s desk the score of De­
bussy’s “Iberia,” and you are done 
with believing that there ever existed 
a school of French composers known 
as impressionists. They all resolve 
into followers of Chabrier, travelers 
in Spain joining in noisy popular rev­
elries. But it does not happen that 
way with every piece of music. Open 
the score of: the Delius Concerto for 
violincello and orchestra before Mr. 
Mengelberg, and put Beatrice Harri­
son at his left hand as soloist, and 
you have a poetic outcome.
The New York Symphony; well, if 
Mr. Busch did not hold the tone 
down, directing the Beethoven Con­
certo for violin and orchestra, with 
the boy, Yehudi Menuhin, as soloist! 
This young lad’s teachers and mana­
gers have much to thank the New 
York Symphony men and conductor 
for at his debut. Does not the musi­
cal dictionary tell us that Bronislaw 
Hubermann made his first public ap­
pearance as a violinist at about the 
same age as Menuhin? Hubermann 
took part in a presentation of the 
Concerto a few seasons 
glory of his maturity; 
audience, light the ap­
plause. If the tone of an orchestra 
can change with the passage of time, 
so, forsooth, can the temper of the 
public. W. P. T
Dressing to catch the eye may be 
an art with the American woman, but 
Dr. John B. Cloppet, university in­
structor in Romance Languages, an 
“out and out” Frenchman who much 
prefers that characteristic the French 
women have of acting to touch the 
heart.
“The American woman is so cold 
and hard and sophisticated," he said 
during an interview yesterday. "She 
is unkind aiid often discourteous in 
her attitude. She carries her so-called 
superiority into unfairness. She pleads 
equality with man, but demands all 
her previous privileges as well as ad­
ditional ones.”
Here 1 interrupted: "You mean she 
wants to ‘eat her pie and have it 
too’.”
“That’s it exactly. Take the case 
of divorces. In the first place there 
are very few divorces in France. The. 
American woman, on the other hand, 
marries a man, drives him.to, to—How 
would you say it?” s
“To drink ” I supplied.
\“Then when she has him welL.spoil­
ed and doesiV’t want him any more, 
she insists that lie pay her alimony to 
get lid of her.”
I opened my mouth indignantly, but 
the gleam in his ¦ eye warned me in 
time and I subsided with a bit of em­
barrassment that I had let myself be 
.rapped.
“But I mean it,” lie went on. "It 
is too bad to generalize. Generaliza­
tions are always unfair. But since 
you insist on having them—” he 
dirugged. “The American woman is 
healthy and fine, and her figure” 
(again that twinkle). “I think it is 
much nicer than that of the French 
woman, but she lacks the lovely and 
kindly eyes of her French sister. You 
women here dress more expensively 
Mi'an our women do, but you lack their 
individuality. You copy each other, 
md a dozen of you taken together 
are repetitions of one personality. 
You apply make-up, but you lack the 
artistry that our women use. A man 
notices and likes what seems most 
natural, not the glaring artificialities.
“Since the war our women too are 
developing more of an independence. 
But still, things that you college wo- 
nen take as a matter of course, just 
aren’t done in France. Take your 
dating.’ No French woman would 
ever be permitted to be out past mid­
night;, much less until 2 or 3 o'clock. 
While to be with a man she’d scarce- 
y but met—-unthinkable!
“I spoke-a moment ago of discour­
tesy. This is what I meant. The 
>tlier day I held open the door while 
'Ive or six women filed out. Not one 
of them even smiled, much less said 
Thank you.’ Now that’s not always 
:he case; it is not even the prevailing 
ipirit, but it is there all the same. It 
is almost a spirit of ‘take all and give 
nothing.’ I suppose it has been 
brought about indirectly because of 
he fact that in coming in contact 
.vitli the world, woman to preserv 
tier independence, has had to build 
about herself a hard protecting shell 
Which is one reason why men prefer 
women in the home.”—University of 
Michigan Daily.
Crowds and crowds; new models, 
new beauty, new colors, new styles, 
new prices, and new inducements; 
greater public interest than ever— 
this" was the New York automobile 
show in 1928. “We must put on this 
year a better and more extensive 
sales campaign than ever,” declared 
the head of one of the companies to 
his assembled salesmen at their an­
nual feast. Undoubtedly he was right, 
despite the proof of unparalleled pub­
ic interest, despite the crowds at Mr. 
Ford’s rival show at the Madison 
Square Garden, despite the large 
number of sales made. For the public 
showed this year a much keener un­
derstanding of technical problems, an

insistence on studying engines as well

unprecedented degree, that it may 
easily make or break important manu­
facturers before another show comes 
around. For there is a price war on 
and a production war too, and the 
American public, especially the young­
er generation looking forward to its 
first cars, find as much of a thrill in 
critically studying car-progress as it 
ever has in baseball or football or 
prize-fighting.

On the Plaid Screen J
BY FREDERICK D. WOODS
The varsity and plebe basket ball teams will invade State College on 
Saturday for games with Penn State, the last games away this season. Prac­
tice, called off during exams week, was renewed yesterday afternoon, with 
Harpster in uniform. In all probability the lineup which faced Pitt will start 
the game with the Nittany Lions, who boast of a good quint this year.
Playing on the State floor, the Skibos will have their work cut out for 
them to win, but if dope means anything, the game should be fairly close. 
Pitt defeated Syracuse by about thirty points, and Syracuse nosed out State 
hy a point, 30 that with both State and Carnegie .improved, the game should 
be a thriller.
Johnny Roepke, State football captain during the past season, is playing 
a forward position on the Center county quint, and is the team’s high scorer 
to date, with Von Neida, Carnegie’s nemesis last year, a close second.* * * '* * * *
Next week the schedule calls for games with Pitt, on Wednesday, ^and 
Penn State on Saturday, both at the local gym. In spite of the team’s lack of 
wins to date, they should be given a rousing reception to help start them 011 
a string of victories at home.***** * *
Intra-mural basket ball will commence next Monday evening, when four 
games will be played. Many of the teams are practicing every day this week, 
hoping to start off with a win, indicating that the games should be well worth watching.
Varsity Rifle Team 
Wins From W. P. I.
Plebe Team Wins Four More 
Matches; Varsity N.R.A. 
Matches Start
During the week ending January 21, 
the varsity rille team lost a match to 
Lehigh University by a narrow mar­
gin, and won a match from Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute. -The match 
with Lehigh was a four position one, 
and the match with Worcester was 
prone. The score with Lehigh was 
1805 to 1797 while the score against 
Worcester was 491 to 455.
The season has not started with the 
previously expected success, but at 
the beginning of the season it looked 
as though a larger amount of material 
would be available and nothing was 
known at that time of the changes in 
the rules to be made this year. These 
changes were late being sent out by 
the N. R. A., and did not come to 
Carnegie until the first match. This 
was a very serious handicap, because 
Carnegie had never fired in the new 
standing position before, and had no 
chance to get any practice before the 
matches began. Most colleges knew 
of the change earlier in the season, 
because a notice of the change had 
been sent out to the colleges before 
the new program came out, but due 
to some error, Carnegie never re­
ceived one of these notices.
During the past week of examina­
tions, the varsity had to fire a match 
with Penn State which is probably the 
hardest team in the N. R. A. league.
'“No word of the league schedule of 
matches was received from the N. R.
A. until the first day to begin firing 
lor the matches. This was a great in­
convenience especiall3r during exami­
nation week.
Another league match has to be 
fired this week and finished by Friday 
evening. The league match this 
week should not be as difficult for the 
weakened Carnegie. team, since their 
opponents have never rated high in 
the past years, but never the less 
they may have a very strong team 
this year, since nothing is known of 
their present team.
The lineup for the Lehigh and Wor­
cester match was:
Carnegie. 4 Pos. Prone
Stine ............................... 37197
Bronson ........................... 3G399
Lippert ........................... 35599
Kasehagen ..........______ 355100
Cole, N. D...................... 35396
1797491
Lockwood ...................... 27696
’ i Plebes Win.
The Plebe rifle team continued 
their good work by winning four more 
matches from strong teams during 
the week ending January 21. This 
makes six victories', and no defeats 
for their first two weeks of matches. 
They defeated U. of Missouri; West 
Virginia U.; Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute freshmen teams, and Cen­
tral High 'School, Washington, D. C. 
These matches have been all prone.
The lineup and score was:
Carnegie—
1. Marshall ......................................... 98
2. Genter ...?..................................... 98
3. Montgomery .................................. 98
4. Herter ............................................. 97
5. McKlveen ....................................... 95
48G
6. Maidment ....................................... 95
Cadmus .............................................94
STtetres ................................................ 93
Anderson ........................................... 93
Central High School....................>481
U. of Missouri ..................................470
U. of West Virginia.........................470
Virginia Polytecli.................................470
The next plebe match will be next 
week, and includes the prone, sitting, 
and kneeling positions, so it is neces­
sary that all the plebes get out this j 
week and practice for these positions. ¦ 
The range will be open every after­
noon after three-thirty, and eariler on 
some days'. It is important that the 
plebes get practice in the various po­
sitions, especially standing and kneel­
ing, because many points are gained 
or lost in these positions.
Brings No Result
He that waits for repentance, waits 
for that which cannot be had as loug 
as It Is waited for. It Is absurd for u 
man to wait for that which he himself 
has to do.—William Nevins.
ARE WOMEN DECEITFUL;
ARE MEN BORES?
EACH SEX PRESENTS 
ITS OWN OPINIONS
I’M SICK OF WOMEN!
As Told to “Scoop" by a Senior Man.
Speaking frankly, and without the 
experience of “sour grapes,” I must 
admit that my experiences with wom­
en of this University have led me to 
the conclusion that they are the most 
deceitful creatures of nature, the most 
ruinous energies directed toward an 
ambitious man and the worst “study- 
killers” a man encounters.
In the five years that I have spent 
at this institution I have learned 
much of the deceit of the co-eds. Ob­
viously they are pious; obviously they 
are devout church-goers; obviously 
they are dilligent students; obviously 
they are particularly enamored of 
each and every date they have; ob­
viously they are still charmingly fem­
inine as evinced by their nightly burn­
ing of incense in the rooms of the 
Boughner house, Woman’s hall, or the 
Annex.
In reality, however, their pious 
mien is but a farce camouflaging the 
fact that many of them go to church 
solely to hear of the modern evils so 
that they can keep "up-to-date” in 
their pursuance of pernicious practices 
observing the way they religiously go 
up to the desk and talk to the in­
structor after class, the unsophisti­
cated male would deduce that they 
are profound and zealous scholars 
rather than cliamelions working a 
bluff. To see them in local soda par­
lors, mooning over a fellow, the novice 
would scent a romantic case of early 
matrimony rather than the more pro­
saic skillful maneuvering of a co-ed 
gold-digger—the actions of a mer­
cenary and a destructive parasite. 
Again, the incense burning is merely 
a "blind-tiger” enabling the girls to 
smoke without fear of detection, I be­
lieve.
Student suicides, crime waves, in­
sane ssylums, and overcrowded jails 
and penitentiaries all bear mute 
testimony—not to the evils of alcohol 
but to the scourge of women. Rumor 
implies numberless disciplinary ses­
sions in officials’ private offices. Circe 
and other women of ancient litera­
ture are still living and engaging in 
the same baleful practices.
I’M DISGUSTED WITH MEN!
As Told to P. E. Z. by Senior From 
Another College.
“I am a senior and have spent over 
three years on a neighboring state 
campus, during which period I have 
had dates with everyone from the 
president of the student body to the 
unsophisticated freshman, I have, 
found them all fundamentally alike.
“Not one fellow has not tried to kiss 
me the first time we had a date, nor 
has one ever shown any real un­
selfishness after the introduction 
formalities were over. The last date 
I had was frightful. We went to a 
dance and enjoyed the first few 
dances, but about that time my es­
cort began to show signs of having 
‘whiffed’ the cork too freely. By the 
time the dance was over he was 
drunk.
“Fortunately it was only a short 
distance to my room and somehow or 
other he managed to arrive there 
with me. I didn’t mind his drinking 
so much, but he tried to stage a neck­
ing party on the front steps.
“I have always hated to submit to 
ovprfamiliarities, but what is a girl to 
do when a boy insists on kissing? I 
have found that a girl must either 
neck or give up dates and be unpopu­
lar. I have tried every method, but 
have found that a man must have it 
his way or he will not ask for another 
date.
“There is at least one consolation. 
After you neck this boy and that one, 
it ceases to give you a thrill and you 
get no more kick out of kissing than j 
you do out of washing your face. At! 
I any rate that is the way I feel, and I 
' know lots of girls who feel the same 
way. I, for one, will be glad when 
June comes and I can leave the whole 
mess—I am disgusted with it all.”
Enthusiasm Valuable
Let us beware of losing our enthu­
siasm; let us ever glory in something 
and strive to retain our admiration 
for all that would ennoble, add our 
interest in all that would enrich und 
beautify our life.—Phillips Brooks.

THE SEMI-ANNUAL NIGHTMARE
Another of Carnegie's bi-annual 
"Hall-weeks” is past. No doubt !t 
has taken its usual toll of casualties 
both in failures, and near nervous 
wroclcs. Perhaps there Is a tendency 
to bo prejudiced against the system 
immediately after having gone 
through its rigors.
Nevertheless, there are many 
points about the present examination 
systom which seem unjust and at 
times inhuman. It VO probable that 
they apply chiefly to tho Engineering 
and Industries school. In tho first 
place thoro are too many examina­
tions given within all too short a 
timo, Tho averago student will have 
from ton to twelve three-hour oxams 
during tho period, somotlmes includ­
ing throe In one day. If the oxamlna* 
(lions contained questions, most of 
which were guneral In nature, they 
would not he unreasonable, unfor­
tunately few if any of tho questions 
will fall wlthih this category; most 
of thorn are special applications of 
ono formula or another. Spociflo 
questions demand special studying 
and cramming tho night Doioro the 
examination for oven the most bril­
liant student. Tho rosult is that tho 
man Is up entirely too late each night 
of fiho exam period. After a week of 
such • routine, combined with a last 
minute wish to get in late reports, 
tho student is physically exhausted 
and almost a nervous and mental 
wreck.
It would be folly, no doubt, to sug­
gest that exams be done away with 
entirely, much less to think that the 
Engineering or Industries school 
would even approach that in liberal­
ism. However, the system could 
stand improvement, it would seem, 
should have undergone some improve­
ment before doing its twenty-odd 
years of perpetual sameness. Why a 
three-hour examination (after the 
hardest exams that are given) should 
be given for a three-unit course, when 
the same amount of time is allotted 
to nine and twelve unit courses, has 
been a mystery for years with the 
students. Perhaps a broader exemp­
tion policy would offer a solution to 
the problem. A few departments 
have stepped far enough out of anti­
quity to adopt the system, and others 
would do well to progress likewise.
Instructors will note a tendency to­
ward laxness on the part of most of 
their students in the next, few weeks, 
and perhaps they will wonder what Is 
its cause. It is merely tho human in­
clination to rolax after a period of In­
tense strain, and this apparent1 in- 
difference will always bo a part of tho 
student attitude, as long as the pres­
ent intense and overemphasized ex­
amination policy remains in force, j 
. . . But, all -may rejoice that tho 
nightmare cannot occur for at least j 
another four months.
Princeton, N. J.—(IP)—The Treas­
ure room at Princeton unversity li­
brary has on display 150 rare items 
which trace the art of printing from
1,452 up to the present.
Included in the collection is a leaf 
from the Gutenberg Bible, a fourth 
Shakespearean folio and two first edi­
tions of Martin Luther’s pamphlets 
against the Catholic Church.
Cardo Chardon Disenwolle.
Thistledown wishes to acknowl­
edge publicly his receipt of a question­
naire privately printed in Pastonchi 
typo on hand-made Perusia paper 
from Fabriauo. Tho questionnaire is 
about the foundation of a now IItor- 
ary magazine at Carnegie Tech. 
Thistledown proposes to put tho 
stamp on the enclosed envelope to 
private use, and to give his views 
campus prominence by spreading 
them out here and now.
Thistledown is interested in a new 
magazine on the campus. There can 
be no doubt that the Puppet usually 
says too much, and the Tartan too lit­
tle. Those two sheets are not big 
enough to cover the campus. The 
levity of the Tartan is hardly, fitted 
to balance the heavy stupidity of 
some of Puppet’s bad jokes. Yes, 
Thistledown feels sure the new little 
sheet will find some place to spread 
itself. Thistledown doesn’t care to 
take, an active part in its publication! 
That sounds too much as if he were 
going to be asked to run the presses, 
or to work on the address list. This 
tiedown believes in leaving such man­
ual labor to plebes. He is interested 
only in the inactive publication of 
this now proposition.
The magazine will certainly include 
special departments for us all. This­
tledown hopes it will publish a series 
of good articles on electroplating. 
And what about an article on the 
newest models of- hot air furnaces. 
There’s nothing like homey material 
like that to interest the married 
couples. And perhaps the editors will 
be able to persuade the math de­
partment to contribute an anonymous 
essay: What Is the Calculus?
A popular price would be a nickel. 
Thistledown for one announces that 
what with the high cost of tuition he 
can’t afford to pay any more.
Thistledown will be glad to con­
tribute. He has two Western stories, 
a sonnet on winter, a scenario enti­
tled A Wet S'pring, one roundelay and 
a virelay, all of which have been sev­
eral times rejected by the cheapest 
American magazines. The new peri- 
I odical is welcome to tliein. Thistle- 
| down, moveover, expects to undergo 
i a poetic agitation soon, and he will 
j quite willingly contribute the results.
Thistledown suggests that the^back 
cover of the new periodical be left 
blank, so that if any copies are found 
lying around the fraternity houses 
they can be used as bridge scores.
Thistledown suggests The Waste­
basket as a name for the new maga­
zine. What can lie a more fitting 
name for a thing than its alpha and 
omega?
Dear Thistledown: 'Since you have 
taken dramatic criticism upon your­
self tell us Avliat you think of Close 
Harmony. Answer: Second rate
American comedy, dealing rather ob­
viously and amateurishly with stock 
characters in proverbial small town 
situations. The self centered wife 
(well done by Mrs. Gregg), her sister 
(Ineffectually played by Miss Copus), 
and a growing girl (perfectly real­
ized by Miss Bodycombo), are too 
much for the amiable and easy going 
husband, who slowly discovers the 
charms of the quondam actross who 
is livlnft’ unhappily with her husband 
next door. A negro servant adds to 
the comedy; Mrs. Porrott acts well 
and brings tho only touch of sadness 
to tho story; Cowan, Wilson, Sullivan, 
and McClure add «loft touches of occa­
sional hilarity. On tho whole, a per­
formance of amusing but monotonous 
humours. To it is added the interest 
of wondering what part of the coun­
try affords such backgrounds as one 
catches glimpses of through window 
and door, who painted that frightful 
nude against blue paint, and what Iv. 
S. N. will have to say about it all.

CLOSE HARMONY
A Review.
Although the current Little Theater 
play, Close Harmony, lias several 
fallacies in it, nobody minded one bit. 
Three of these fallacies are so appar­
ent they need not be demonstrated. 
First—A man with so fearful a brute 
for a daughter as Ed Graham had 
would not have remained land to her 
all those years. Why? Because he 
would have shot her long before. Any 
man would have, or I am mistaken in 
my judgement of men as occasionally 
rational. Second—A man with a 
grain of sense in his head, given the 
opportunity to escape from his infer­
nal wife and brat with a luscious 
creature such as Belle, would not 
have lost enthusiasm so quickly. If 
you do not agree with me, you are a 
fool, and have no eye. No eye is 
what I said. Third—The mere thought 
that poor Belle had gone through life 
so long without anybody being kind 
to her provokes loud, sustained, ex­
uberant guffaws. What, nobody kind 
to that ravishing creature? Come; 
come! That will do. Still, I suppose 
the authors didn’t realize that anyone 
so charming as Mrs. Perrott would 
eyer be cast in the part of Belle. And 
you can’t blame them, either, after 
seeing what so many actresses .'.look 
like close to.
Yes, the play was indubitably fal­
lacious, but, I repeat, nobody minded. 
Y6u don’t criticize farce, or froth 
either. You either listen to tho hearty 
whacks of the slapstick and bellow 
with joy, or you. run away somewhere 
out of range. No one chose to run. 
And, like Mr. Coolidge, they were 
wise.
Mr. Wallace’s production gave us a 
gay evening, and we could not ask for 
more, especially just at, the time 
when the word "midnight'’ provokes 
acute nausea, vertigo, and a sjpting 
feeling in the occipital region be­
cause of its immediate association 
with the word "oil.” If we cannot 
have organ music to cheer us before 
examinations, by all means let . us
have mirth to cheer us after. Let the 
lugubrious freshman who has just re­
ceived R in History of Plumbing get 
down on his knees and beg the Pow­
ers for a ticket; let the bloody but 
unbowed junior with six F's to his 
eternal credit demand haughtily that 
he shall be excused from his Pipe 
Threading Thesis course to be titi­
vated with Close Harmony; let all 
other weary wights trip it, trip it, trip 
it, on the light fantastic toe to the 
door of the Little Theater and beg 
Mr. Bullinger oh please to be pierciful 
just once and let them in. (He won’t, 
of course). As for the* sneering 
savants, may they keep each other’s 
meagre company and not come near 
to din their criticisms in our ears. 
Again I say it, one does not criticize 
farcical froth. It indicates a distress­
ing lack of savoir faire, of je ne sais 
quoi, of critical chic.
Mon Dieu, that is it—critical chic.. 
What a delightful phrase for a Gil­
bert libretto — Crit, crit, critical; 
critical, critical; critically critical— 
Oh well, I won’t go on if you mind it 
as much as all that.
The acting was quite all right-4 
anybody knows that. Not a person 
in the cast but deserves appreciative 
comment. There was considerable 
over-doing, of course, but the enor­
mous amount of dull small talk in the 
piece demanded some sort of tonic, 
and the actors gave it by exaggerat­
ing wherever exaggeration would 
help. Perhaps Miss- Bodycombe and 
Miss Copas over-did too much— 
neither was as plausible as she should 
have been—but the sweet suavity of 
Mr. Sullivan and the engaging con­
versational tones of Mr. McClure were 
an effective counter-balance. Mrs. 
Gregg again justified the director’s 
choice, as it-is easy to see she will do 
consistently. Mrs. Perrott was as 
near perfect in the part of Belle as 
anybody could have wished; what­
ever the mood, she caught it exactly 
and conveyed it delicately; indeed, 
she transfigured the unhappy Belle, 
and made it possible for me to use 
that much-abused word—"divine”— 
Need I say more? Nay.
Harvard — The Harvard Crimson 
sent a reporter to interview M. Maur­
ice Ravel, who is a kind of authority 
in the world of the symphony, and 
Ravel has delivered himself of a few 
ideas about jazz and about composi­
tion that are more than interesting.
"Jaz was developed in an entirely 
artificial way, but it is now ‘tout a fait 
, typique’ as American music. Just as 
j the Germans founded their music on 
| folksong and we French based ours 
| on the songs of the French people, so 
will you Americans use jazz, which 
j has become your folksong. Other in- 
! fluences will also be felt, of course, 
j I, for instance, was influenced by De- 
I bussy, and then I, in turn, influenced 
him later.”
: Asked whether he favored the con-
i temporary swing so many composers 
are taking back to classicism and 
j counterpoint, he answered, "Favor it? 
j I started myself. Yes, I favor it, but 
I do not believe In going back farther 
than Mozart. When you have found 
perfection, why search farther? De­
bussy had taken us in to sentimental­
ism and had led use to the end of the 
road,” stated M. Ravel, explaining this 
modern movement. "Further we-could 
not go. It was inevitable that we 
should return to some kind of formal­
ism. Music, to my way of thinking, 
and all art for that matter, must rep­
resent a balance of the sentimental 
and the intellectual. Composers, of 
late, have been emphasizing the intel­
lectual out of proper proportion. They 
have developed a counterpoint' more 
abstract than Bach's. They have de­
veloped it to such a degree of formal­
ism as to make it inexpressible."
Asked what he meant by saying 
that Mozart had "found perfection,” 
M. Ravel said that the German com­
poser’s music contained “technique, 
expression and beauty generally. Bach 
contains some great things, but not 
all great things, as does Mozart.”
"I studied art with Edgar Allen Poe, 
that incomparable master. I learned 
to compose not by studying music, 
but by reading poetry,” he concluded.

Temple University.—A recipe for 
perfect children was suggested to 
mothers by Miss Laura Drumond, of 
the faculty of the Home Economics 
Department of Teachers' College, Tem­
ple University, last Friday, in an ad­
dress on “Feeding the Little Child.”
Miss Drummond’s address was one 
of a series of "Home-Maker” talks, 
designed by the Russell H. Conwell 
Foundation to interest women in gen­
eral, and housewives in particular. It 
was broadcast by radio station 
-WCAU.
"Take one average little boy or girl,” 
said Miss Drummond, “and add daily 
three wholesome meals, eight glasses 
of water, ten hours of sleep, at least 
two hours of play, and an abundance 
of water in the form of baths.
"Mix the ingredients with regular­
ity and care; sprinkle with plenty of 
fresh air and sunshine; garnish liber­
ally with snow or green grass; and 
season well with smiles; serve in 
happy surroundings as a'well-browned 
rosy-checked American child.”
TESTS INDICATE
RACE TOLERANCE
I Mount Vernon, Iowa.-1-'That fresh- 
I man students at Cornell College ad­
mire the Norwegian but dislike the 
Greek and Jew; like the Irishman for 
his wit, but distrust the Mexican and 
! Turk, are conclusions' drawn from a 
j test conducted by Dr. William H. Nor­
ton of the department of geology and 
geography, to ascertain the attitude of 
| young people toward some twenty-five 
I nationalities. In conducting this test, 
the liamevaf the nationality was read 
and the student signified his like or 
dislike by marking down a plus or 
minus, with reasons for such discrim­
ination. A zero indicated indifference.
Norwegians are the most popular, 
grading 95 per cent, because of "per­
sonal contacts,” “Viking stories,” as 
well as Norwegian descent. Danes 
(92 per cent) and Swedes (91 per 
cent) are nearly as popular. They are 
thought "big hearted,” "good natured,” 
and some are even liked because the 
girls "prefer blondes.”
Canadians seem to be liked because 
they are "true blue,” "just like us.” 
They rank 94 per cent "Scotch songs” 
and “Harry Lauder” help make the 
Scotch high in the estimation of the 
freshmen, but descent and contact 
count more. Nearly everyone liked 
the Irish because of "keen wit,”! and 
"blarney.” The English (90 per cent) 
are thought to have "unexaggerated 
courtesy” and "efficient government," 
but some think them "domineering,11 
with a "provoking sense of superior­
ity.”
The Mexican, as lie is described in 
novels and nowspapors, and shown in 
the movies, is largely to blame for the 
idea that ho is a "dirty, treacherous 
murderer,” a "Greaser.” A few stu­
dents who have had personal contact 
with Mexicans hav^e found them "good 
friends.” The Spaniard is lilted. He 
Is "romantic,” "gallant to women,” 
'Spain "full of beautiful castles.”
Greeks are disliked because of 
shoe shining,” and “dirty restaurants.” 
The Hollanders (S7 per cent) are 
liked for "cleanliness,” and "wooden 
shoes.” Russians stand low (20 per
cent) because of “cruelty,” and even 
"cartoon whiskers.” The Chinese 
rank 35 per cent in popularity due to 
"low standards of living," but they 
have friends won by their "ambition” 
and “progress.” The Japanese score 
higher (51 per cent) on industry, 
cleverness, cherry blossoms. The Ne­
gro loses out because of dark skin, 
laziness, and a belief in white su­
premacy. He is liked on the' other 
hand because he is “good hearted” 
and “ambitious.” Shyloclc is largely 
the cause of dislike for the Jews (13 
per cent). They, are considered 
“tricky,” and “kind of queer.” Some 
admire them because of personal ac­
quaintanceship and others feel sym­
pathy for their sufferings.
That the college actually removes a 
good deal of ancient race prejudice 
through sympathetic study of other 
peoples is indicated by the results of 
another .test given at-the same time 
to a group-r of upper classmen. With 
these seniors and juniors, friendliness 
to the Scandanavians and English had 
risen to 100 per cent. «The Russians 
had gained 30 points, and the Mexi­
cans rated 20 points above the fresh­
man score, and Jew and Chinese were 
both twice as popular.
THE NEW ART
"Men of Kansas!” shouts the Uni­
versity Daily Kansan in a plea for the 
. inclusion of another important art— 
that of cosmetic make-up into the col- 
| lege curriculum. "Are you to con­
tinue supinely regarding this parade 
of frightfulness which is forced upon 
you day by day? Rise in your right­
eous wrath and demand that the fac­
ulty either teach your weak sisters 
that a splotch of barn paint on each 
cheek and a "catsupy” looking mouth 
do not constitute real beauty, or bar 
such frightfulness from the sacred 
environs of the Hill.”
Harvard—"It was somewhat of a 
surprise to us this morning in McKin- 
loclc Hall when vre gathered in our 
shoes, placed trustfully outside the 
door- and found them quite unpol­
ished,” asserted F. J. Nugee, assistant 
headmaster of Radley School to a 
Crimson scribe. "Our boots have 
been getting rather more and more 
disgraceful since we came to this 
country. No time and place to have 
them furbished up, you know.”
This was the chief comment vouch­
safed by the leader of the English vis­
itors at Harvard. He was very much 
gratified when he was informed that 
Harvard Square abounded in wielders 
of the brush and shine cloth.
“In England, you know, even in the 
colleges, we have fellows to attend to 
the shoes placed outside the bedroom 
door. It’s a great saving of time. 
Wonder you haven’t thought of it 
here,” he’ commented.
The almost unanimous complaint of 
the British boys was in regard to the 
astonishing American- vice of “cut­
ting in” at dances.
"It’s dashed bad stuff,” declared R:~
C. Henderson, their spokesman, "you 
would get chucked out of any English 
dance for pulling such a steal. Why, 
you can’t rush a real stunner for a 
minute without getting broken up by 
som,e lad. It’s a regular scrim! And
I say, if you aren’t careful do you 
know, you might trot a-way the whole 
night with one partner. On and off 
on schedule is our ticket. Lots bet­
ter.”
A discussion of the virtues of the 
one and two piece bathing suit ended 
up the interview. The British variety, 
it seems, is strictly one piece a la 
Deauville. A strong case in support 
of this garment was made out by the 
visitors.
"Looks a bit balmier’’ was the suc­
cinct remark which covered the entire 
subject in an adequate and expressive 
fashion.—Harvard Crimson.

Ohio Northern University—An arti­
cle in the Ohio Northern Review enti­
tled "Men’s Leap Year Hints” will 
amuse girls:
-To write about leap year from the 
men^s viewpoint presents difficulties 
that can easily be imagined. We real­
ize, at this time that we are supposed 
to be in demand and even though ex­
tremely anxious to be loved, we must
strive -to appear not the least bit ex­
cited.
Leap year does have its advantages, 
though, it gives us a much needed 
and well earned rest. For three years 
we havebeen obliged to try to con­
vince the ladies how manly, intelligent 
and "different” we are. It takes real 
salesmanship to convince them, too. 
Now, however, the play is reversed, 
and we can sit back and take things 
more easily.
In Scotland, at one time, if a woman 
proposed marriage to a man during 
the leap year he either had to marry 
her or go to jail unless he could prove 
that he was already engaged. We are 
thankful that the laws concerning this 
custom have changed, it might place 
some of us in a rather embarrassing 
position.
Allow us to present two suggestions 
to the girls Concerning leap year,, 
which we believe will bring gratifying 
results (to us at least). All co-eds 
driving cars should offer rides to men 
on cold mornings, other mornings as 
well. Also you should request men’s 
company at Lehr, the Odeon, and all 
other social functions. By following 
these instructions, you are sure to* 
capture us. "Now chase me.”—Ohio- 
Northern Review.
University of Arizona—“Chubby-built 
co-eds are the most studious” was a 
statement recently made by the direc­
tor of physical education at the Uni­
versity of Arizona. “The slender co-ed. 
is. more popular, socially and therefore 
more frequently distracted from studi­
ous pursuits” was one of the chief ar­
guments presented. According to this 
they have the opportunity either to 
become studious or to reduce and be­
come popular.
Austin, Texas—The University of 
Texas has recently become interested, 
in Esperanto, the proposed universal 
language which has recently been in­
troduced on the campus by Professor 
Alfred Kepgott, of the department of 
Germanic languages, has no limit to 
its range of appeal. Intellectuals, 
policemen, students, gunmen, and. 
bricklayers are all attracted by the 
new languages and easily become en­
thusiastic over its possibilities as an 
auxiliary form of speech.
The entire police force of Antwerp 
decided to learn the new language en 
masse, as it were. An instructor was 
arranged for, and a picture made of 
the entire force for distribution to 
Esperanto groups.
A unique custom was continued last 
summer at the nineteenth universal 
Esperanto congress, which was held 
in the free city of Antwerp, by plant­
ing an international Esperanto tree. 
Each delegate • contributed some of 
the soil of his country to place about 
the, roots of the tree. A total of 35 
countries were thus represented.
Since the organization of the Espe­
ranto club on the campus a few weeks 
ago, more than tw'o hundred students 
have signed up for the work which is 
given without credit. It was found 
necessary to divide thè club into four 
sections. Interest in the language is 
not confined to the student body, how­
ever. Approximately ten members 
of the university faculty attend the 
meetings of the club regularly. T)ne 
professor brings his entire family 
each week.
Indiana University—The campus cat 
is out of the bag at Indiana Univer­
sity. The merchants observe an in­
crease in the sale of bloomers due to 
the'fact that the dean of women bans 
all bloomerless co-eds. “No bloomers, 
no class attendance” was the sub­
stance of the order. One of the rea­
sons for such action was from a stand­
point of health. Only-about one girl 
in ten has objected. Fraternity men 
were divided on the question of 
whether the wearing of bloomers dis­
tracted from the chic appearance of 
the fair co-eds. One‘cynical fraternity 
¦man was credited with saying, “The" 
girls used to check their corsets. I 
wonder if in 1928 dancers will start 
checking their bloomers.” If this state­
ment should be the case what will it 
be in 1940?
University of Minnesota—A member 
of the-University of Minnesota'was ar­
rested recently, for "seeking a thrill.” 
He was connected with a series of 
burglaries in St. Paul, two of his ac­
complices being under 15 years of age. , 
At the -present -day this seems to be 
one of the popular pastimes, but, how­
ever, it is not deemed advisable for 
the welfare of growing youth.
Oregon State' College, Corvallis—A 
champion sleeper has been discovered 
by an O. S. C. accounting professor. 
The man fell asleeep in the professor’s
2 o’clock accounting class and slept 
unnoticed into the 3 o’clock period 
when laughing students attracted the 
professor’s attention to the sleeper. 
Being good of heart the professor let 
him sleep until 4 o’clock before wak­
ing him. The professor wonders with 
all the noise he makes, how the boy 
could sleep through two of his classes.
Minneapolis, Minn.—(IP)—Actually 
accomplishing what most college stu­
dents seem to think they can, Martin 
Heinecken, graduate student of the 
University of Minnesota, began a 
journey to Australia to be professor 
of German and Latin at Immanuel 
college, Adelaide, within four hours 
after he completed his final examina­
tions for the Master of Arts degree.
