Stever Considers Changes 
In Tech Housing And Dining
by Sue Attinson
President Stever is currently considering several immediate and long-range plans for 
student housing at Carnegie Tech.
Recommendations for men’s housing include the suggestion that a professional resi­
dent be employed to “improve materially the social, recreational, and political environ­
ments of the men’s housing complex,” and that an architectural study be made of the hill 
dormitories with the objective “of improving the appearance and living accommodations 
in the complex.” According to the report, a face-lifting of Boss, McGill and Scobell, plus 
appropriate landscaping should be a minimum consideration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------? Proposed changes in women’s

Panhellic Council will install new officers on April 21.
The slate of officers now of-#---------------------------------------------------
ficially passed includes: Pam 
Mayer (CO), president; Carol 
Breuer (SK), vice president;
Margie Goldman (AEP), trea­
surer; Betsy Atkins (KAT),'sec­
retary; Pat Bonner (KKG), rush 
chairman; Ruth Steiger (CO), as­
sistant rush chairman; Mary 
Valpe (DDD), social chairman;
Marlene De Marco (KAT), Greek 
sing chairman; and Carolyn Wolk 
(DG), chief justice.
Two new positions have been 
tentatively created and filled this 
year.
If the motion for sorority floors 
is passed, Jean Melaney (KAT) 
will co - ordinate Pan-Hellenic 
housing affairs and Carol Alcrich 
(SK) will work to promote 
better fraternity-sorority co-plan­
ning.
Lynelle (Tiger) Torno, current
president of Panhel, recently 
stated that the goal of her ad­
ministration has been an “at­
tempt to make sorority women 
the best possible example of edu­
cated women on campus in scho­
lastic, cultural, as well as social 
areas of endeavor.”
The group worked toward 
achieving this goal through nu­
merous projects beginning orien­
tation week with a fashion show 
for freshman women which fea­
tured clothing from the Shady- 
side Surrey Shop.
According to Tiger this year’s 
rush was the most successful of 
any in the past five years. The 
number of sorority women was 
elevated by 5% from 1964 and 
now stands at 28% of total un­
dergraduate women.

Frosh And Stever 
Discuss Tech Campus
by Mary Forester
Dr. H. Guyford Stever, president of Carnegie Tech, spoke 
informally with a small group of students in Morewood 
Gardens library on April 8. ?
Sponsored by the YMCA Fresh­
man Cabinet, the discussion cen­
tered around students’ and ad­
ministrators’ problems on campus, 
as well as Dr. Stever’s reactions 
to Carnegie Tech and Pittsburgh.
When asked about the differ­
ences between CIT and MIT, Dr. 
Stever replied, “Although Car­
negie Tech has more green grass, 
and MIT more skyscrapers,” both 
schools share common problems 
and advantages.
Dr. Stever pointed to the many 
cultural opportunities available 
to students as just one of the 
many advantages of Carnegie 
Tech’s urban environment.
In discussing the apathy on 
campus, Dr. Stever noted that
spent in rallies, cheering and 
post-mortem discussions of the 
game. Dr. Stever stated that in 
this generation, however, the 
student is unable to decide among 
the various opportunities avail­
able. He may want to play foot­
ball, go to several meetings, at­
tend a concert and study at the 
same time.
Obviously, said Dr. Stever, all 
but one of these activities must 
be sacrificed to the activity 
chosen.
Dr. Stever pointed to the fact 
that student apathy is the stu­
dents’ problem, rather than the 
administration’s.
He said that he is pleased to 
see pressure for the student
Carnegie Tech students are not i union coming from the student
alone in their concern for lack 
of participation in extra-cur­
ricular activities and political 
and religious meetings. Dr. 
Stever feels that this apathy 
is a result of an era in which 
the college student has a veri­
table plethora of activities from 
which to chose.
Dr. Stever pointed to his own 
college days at Colgate, where 
the whole student body turned 
out for the weekend football 
game. The entire weekend was
housing regulations include the 
trial-basis operation of A tower 
as an “open” or “honor” tower 
with the 80 spaces being assigned 
to selected seniors and juniors 
with preference being given to 
those 21 years of age, and the 
provision that students who are 
seniors or 21 be permitted with 
parental approval to move off 
campus.
They als6 include the assign­
ment of individual floors in 
towers to sororities _ or similar 
groups “so that their members 
might more effectively develop 
programs for themselves and 
thereby gain greater experience 
in self-government.”

Describing the dining facilities 
at Carnegie Tech as “open, some­
what barn-like structures with at­
tendant characteristics of noise, 
poor lighting and lack of priv­
acy,” the recommendation sug­
gests that a study be instituted, 
“designed to rencvate and mod­

The group will also award a

to a sorority woman. Selection

ment, financial need, and contri­
bution to the Greek system.
In addition, Panhel has been 
instrumental in the application 
for sorority suites in Morewood 
Gardens. There have been sev­
eral meetings of officers and ad­
visors with President H. Guyford 
Stever on this subject.

completed with the installation of

as a possible solution.
A further recommendation 
states that “consideration be given 
to the installation of a coed din­
ing system.”
These recommendations are 
all part of a report, submitted 
to President Stever by George 
K. Brown, dean of student 
affairs.
In addition to recommending 
changes in the present housing 
system, the report reviews the 
various areas of student housing 
and those problems especially ap­
parent in each area; poses ques­
tions about the problems and
practices now in use; and presents 
a basic policy philosophy for Car­
negie Tech.

it is in our future plans.”
He said that when the time 
comes to build a student union, 
consultation with students as to 
what facilities are to be included, 
will be necessary and useful. He 
feels that students can effectively 
evaluate the need for various 
facilities.
As the discussion turned to 
academics, Dr. Stever remarked,

Earl Gross, 1924 Grad 
Award Winning Artist
by Howard Weiss
Earl Gross has been a nationally known artist for over 
forty years. His paintings are displayed in such institutions 
as the New Britain Museum of American Art, the Atlanta Art 
Institute, the Pentagon, and the Illinois State Museum.
A native of Pittsburgh, Gross 
received his A.B. from Carnegie 
Tech in 1924. He has also attend­
ed Westminster College.
Today he is president of the 
Stevens-Gross Studios. Clients to 
which Gross has supplied com- 
^ mercial art include the United 
States Treasury Department, Gen­
eral Motors, Ford, the Red Cross, 
and General Electric. For forty- 
one years he has done work for 
the Crippled Children’s Charity.
Gross hat written several articles 
on painting for the American Art­
ist Magazine. Every year he pre­
sents several lectures, painting 
demonstrations, and one man 
shows all over the nation.
0 In his own opinion, Gross’s 
greatest accomplishment has been 
as Official Combat Artist, Far 
East, for the United States Air 
Force. Gross has won the Adju­
tant General’s Corps’ award for 
the best painting of a war subject.
Other awards and honors which 
he has received include first prize, 
Artist’s Guild of Chicago; second 
rrize, Denver Art Show; and sec­
ond prize Cosmopolitan Magazine’s 
C illustrator’s competition.
Gross’s efforts are featured in 
Seascapes and Landscapes in Wa­
ter Color by Norman Kent.
The New York Times says of 
Gross’ work: “This is robust and 
pulsatic water color painting. You 
never feel that Mr. Gross paints 
anything he does not want in­
tensely to paint.’
The New York Herald Tribune
calls Gross “an artist of talent

. . . gets his effects with strength 
and brilliance.”
Gross, along with Frank Lloyd 
Wright and Daniel Catton Rich,

the Art Directors Club of Chicago. 
He is also life-time member of the

Chevrolet. It’s a bigger, more

thrifty it is, with money-

Congress work and its problems exist in 
many areas, and if it is to conquer the criti­
cism it now receives, it must meet and over­
come the problem on all levels.
Primarily, Congress must be strong and 
work within itself. The members must at­
tend meetings, participate in committee 
work, and be generally knowledgable on all 
facets of Congress business.
To insure meaningful legislation and ac­
tions at each meeting, the chairman must 
have definite plans for each meeting . and 
must conduct business within strict rules of 
order. The meetings cannot be too long nor 
too frequently held to insure continued 
member attendance and interest.
Under the direction of the Finance Com­
mittee, I have sought a major increase in the 
budget of Student Government for 1965-66. 
The budget will be increased 20%' over the 
figure of the current fiscal year. Also under 
my direction, the Emergency Loan Program 
has been investigated by Congress. This in­
vestigation resulted in the resumption of the 
program and benefits that any hard-pressed 
student who has borrowed from the fund 
will attest to. An account of that investiga­
tion appeared in the Tartan.
During the year that I have served in 
Congress, I have observed that many of my 
fellow representatives are not offered an op­
portunity to fully utilize their talents to the 
betterment of Student Government. In par­
ticular, there is a lack of opportunity for par­
ticipation in the committees, where the real 
work of government is done. I intend to 
make committee work mandatory for each 
representative and to provide ample commit­
tee responsibilities in a variety of areas.
Three of the new committees I will cre­
ate shall be the Housing Committee, Senior 
Class Committee and the Financial Aid 
Committee.
The Housing Committee will assist 
Women’s dormitory Council and Men’s Dor­
mitory Council in the pursuit of better liv- ! 
ing conditions in all existing campus hous­
ing areas. It shall lend its weight to the de­
cisions on sorority floors, off-campus living,^ 
honors towers, and social opportunities made 
by the dormitory governments.
The representatives of the Men’s and 
Women’s Dormitory Councils will staff this 
committee. The committee will also sit-in on 
administrative discussions of new dormitory 
policies and facilities.
The Senior Class Committee will en­
deavor to make the senior year more mean- i 
ingful to seniors. The apathy of the senior

ticipation in committee work. He must be 
! able to draw the best possible committee 
| heads into congress work — whether they be 
members or not — and he must encourage 
and assist them in drawing each member and 
as many non-members as possible into par­
ticipation. The Chairman must work closely 
with the committee chairmen and the Con­
gress Vice Chairman to insure that all stu­
dents business appropriate to Congress is 
thoroughly studied and brought before Con­
gress for appropriate action.
The present work of the Rules, Assembly, 
General Campus, Freshman Orientation, Fall 
Festival, and Spring Carnival Committees 
must be continued with increased enthusi­
asm. But also the work of the Finance, Con­
stitution, Union, Publicity, Elections, Activi­
ties and Tech Committees must be more effi­
ciently and meaningfully attacked.

But Who's Running Him?
Former Student Criticizes
U. S. Position In Vietnam
Congress Revitalization
Since its conception in 1956, Student Con­
gress has gained acceptance and support for 
itself from both the student body it repre­
sents and the administration. With time and 
experience, however, Congress has become 
self-confident and at times severely apa­
thetic. If it is now to expect more than criti­
cism, it must re-evaluate itself and its goals 
and by so doing return to the enthusiastic 
years when it was still struggling for student 
and administration recognition and support.
Communications should be established to 
eliminate confusion. Minutes of the previous 
meeting, an agenda for the next meeting, and 
as much detailed information pertinent to 
Congress business or committee work as pos­
sible should be assembled by the Rules and 
Publicity Committees and sent ' to every 
member one week in advance of each meet­
ing. Frequent discussion of the chairman’s 
meetings with administration officials and 
with other groups such as Executive Council, 
must also be the chairman’s responsibility 
to Congress as well.
The Chairman must also encourage par-

In Vietnam, the war we have been 
waging is a brutal and dirty war 
with the forces of the current 
Saigon government and of the 
United States committing more 
than their share of the atrocities. 
For instance, several days ago, 
our airplanes bombed a village 
and a schoolhouse therein because 
someone from that village alleg­
edly took a shot at an American 
reconnaisance plane. Thirty-seven 
(37) children were killed when 
the schoolhouse was bombed. 
(New York Times 3/18/65).
“Our own men and the 
forces we arm have long 
been burning up villages 
with napalm. We have 
begun to use phosphorous 
shells, also intended to 
to burn alive; we have 
been trying out ‘anti­
personnel’ bombs which 
scatter sharp, razor-like 
fragments in a wide area 
and a new type of bullet 
which somersaults on en­
tering the flesh in a way 
which makes ordinary 
minor wounds fatal.”
(I. F. Stone’s Weekly, 
3/29/65).
And now, we are using, a new 
type of “non-lethal” gas, thus es­
tablishing again a most barbarous 
form of warfare, previously stop­
ped by the Geneva Protocol of
1925. Here it is important to note 
that a gas, non-lethal to a healthy 
25 year old male, might indeed be 
highly lethal to a 70 year old 
woman, a 2 month old child, or 
for that matter to a sickly person 
regardless of age.
What is the excuse behind this 
policy? Why are we a party to 
these dastardly deeds? We say 
that we are opposing an attack by 
North Vietnam against the legiti­
mate, legally constituted govern­
ment of the sovereign state of 
South Vietnam. Yet when we try 
to document such an attack by the 
recent White Paper, we are un­
able to do so, as is noted by I. F. 
Stone’s Weekly, the New Republic, 
and the New York World Tele­
gram, to name but a few.
As a matter of fact, Richard 
Starnes, writing for the New 
York World Telegram on March 
15, 1965, sayc of the White Paper, 
“Reasoned analysis of the docu­
ment shows that it actually proves 
the reverse of what it sets out to 
prove.” He continues “Even ac­
cepting the White Paper’s wholly 
unsubstantiated reckoning of the 
total number of North Vietnamese 
guerrillas who have been sent to 
the South, it is plain that the Viet 
Cong Guerrillas — like the weap­
ons. The “invasion” thus seems to 
reduce to a Civil War.

government, the so-called “legi-

Chairman* s F unctions
The Chairman of Student Government is 
offered a unique experience in political de­
velopment and professional opportunity. He 
is expected to carry out a comprehensive 
program. The Student Congress, over which 
he presides, must offer all of its members op-
Aronovitz
portunities to carry out assignments that will 
effect this campus, the future of the student 
body, and their personal development for 
many years.
The present Student Government, in 
which I am serving as a Commuter Repre­
sentative and Chairman of the Finance Com­
mittee, has made major advances in a few 
areas. Under the direction of the General 
Campus Committee, the library hours have 
been greatly extended, the calendar is being 
reconsidered, and parking regulations are 
now being looked into.

class is discouraging, and the support given 
to the Alumni Association is weak.
The chairman of the Senior Class Com­
mittee will be elected at a class meeting of 
the senior class to be held in October. He 
will be the President of the senior class and 
will be expected to carry out a wide-ranging 
program of his own choosing. He will seek 
special privileges for seniors including a 
senior dormitory and reduced costs for sen­
iors at Spring Carnival and Fall Festival.
The Financial Aid Committee will conT 
sist of Congress members and justices of the 
Student Court. It will meet with the Finan­
cial Aid Committee of the administration to 
evaluate the current policies regarding the 
award of scholarships and loans to determine 
if the limited funds available are being used 
to the best advantage of the student body. 
It will also look into cases of fraudulent 
financial claims that I have reason to believe 
are presently undetected. Salaries for part- 
time student help, opportunities for student 
employment, and increased aid to juniors 
seeking summer work shall be major areas 
of endeavor for this committee.
Finally, I propose to instill Student Gov­
ernment with the patience needed to carry 
out long-range policies that may not reach 
completion during the undergraduate career 
, • of the original sponsors. The Calendar Com- 
*rnittee is the first of many long-range proj­
ects with which we will be concerned.
Other dramatic goals, which I now list 
for your consideration, will be areas of pri­
mary effort for the next few years.
(1) By the fall of 1968 a new building 
will be opened containing lounges, ping-pong 
and pool tables, bowling alleys, and a snack 
counter and eating area. All of these facili­
ties will be intended for the exclusive use of 
^>the student body.
(2) By the spring of 1968 all debts ac­
crued by Student Government and the un­
dergraduate organizations prior to 1962 shall 
be cancelled.
(3) By 1970 the total expenditures of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology on Student 
government and athletics shall be doubled 
so as to be at least 3% of the school’s total 
expenditures. 
ik Now I leave it to the student body to sup- 
f*-'port my campaign for Chairman of Student 
Congress by making your representatives 
aware of the need for responsible leadership 
and positive action in Student Government. 
You can not help but to notice that there 
are only two candidates for the highest 
elected office on this campus. It is my inten­
tion to elevate the prestige of Congress and 
of the office of Chairman to such a position 
that will make the office more widely sought.

should combine their efforts to undertake an 
earlier and more thorough investigation of 
the Student Congress Budget for next year. 
They should study the debt conditions of the 
student organizations and with this and the 
realistic appraisal of next year’s needs pre­
sent concrete proposals to the administra­
tion. Then, through the year they should 
continually work with the activities’ busi­
ness managers and PiDE to insure sound fis­
cal responsibility as well as interest and en­
thusiasm in campus activities.
The Constitution and Elections Commit­
tees should combine their efforts to revise 
the Student Government Constitution so that 
it is useful and realistic to every member of 
Student Congress.
The Union. Committee should continue 
their study of Skibo with the intention of 
presenting proposals which may be imple­
mented to make the building more useful to 
students.
The Tech Committee should be reacti­
vated to provide the framework for revived 
support of Tech athletics. It should also be 
used by the freshmen as is the present tern 
porary committee, to represent them, present 
their ideas to Congress and draw them into 
Congress.
Better use must be made of the Vice 
Chairman as an advisor and leader in Con­
gress activities.
Finally, the Publicity Committee must 
present Congress and its accomplishments to 
the student body. The Tartan and WRCT 
should be used more effectively and more 
frequently as should the campus bulletin 
boards to encourage student knowledge, in­
terest, and support for Student Congress.
With these areas being covered, the Con­
gress Chairman can then present Congress 
legislation to the administration with the 
confidence that they will accept it as the 
will of the student body. He should encour­
age frequent meetings between the admini­
stration officials and members and commit­
tees of Congress to insure mutual under­
standing. He can open avenues to efficient 
and meaningful respect for Student Con­
gress.
The Chairman must undertake to elevate 
Congress with every part of this program 
and must retain the idea of a rebirth for Stu­
dent Congress throughout the new Congress 
year. I hope I may undertake this program 
as Chairman with the new Congress.
timate” government of South 
Vietnam doesn’t exist, mainly be­
cause there is some confusion as 
to just which military faction is 
currently in power in Saigon. 
Concerning the “governments,” 
Waynes Morse, senior Senator 
from Oregon, has stated that all 
these governments are, in his own 
words, “American puppets.” It has 
now become obvious, after a suc­
cession of military take-overs, that 
there is no viable government in 
Saigon. As a mater of fact, it 
seems the only stable government 
is Vietnam is the one we are fight­
ing.
Thus it would appear, the case 
for American intervention as 
presented by the State Depart­
ment entirely breaks down.
If now, our Government really 
has as the basis of its policy the 
so-called domino theory namely 
that the fall of South Vietnam to 
“communists” would jeopardize 
the strategic position of the non- 
Communist states in Southeast 
Asia, and that one after another 
they would fall to Communist 
guerillas, and that then, eventu­
ally the very security of the 
United States would be threaten­
ed, then why have none of these 
potential “falling dominoes” lent 
any meaningful aid to our war 
effort. Where is SEATO? Why, as 
a matter of fact, have most of 
these States publicly voiced dis­
approval of our policy of bomb­
ing North Vietnam and of enlarg­
ing the war in the South?
Thus Burma, in the person of 
U. N. Secretary General U-Thant, 
has advocated negotiations as a 
means to effect an American with­
drawal “from that part of the 
world.” (New York Times, Feb. 
25, 1965). To be sure, U-Thant 
does not speak officially for the 
Burmese Government, but he is a 
prominent Burmese personage, 
formerly high ranking in the gov­
ernment and no doubt is still 
connected with that government 
although perhaps unofficially, or 
in an advisory capacity. To dis­
miss his comments as not being 
representative of the Burmese 
Government is to be unrealistic. 
Pakistan, Burma, Cambodia, In­
dia, Ceylon, Indonesia, and Af­
ghanistan have voiced disapproval 
of our policy.
Here it is interesting to note 
that Burma, which has a common 
boundary with China, has been 
able to maintain a viable neutral­
ist government, as have Cambodia 
and Pakistan, each located geo­
graphically in similar positions. 
It is no wonder that the states­
men running the foreign policy of 
these governments do not appre­
ciate the domino theory when ap­
plied to Asia. The “domino 
theory,” when applied to the situ­
ation in Vietnam, is a fraud. The 
Guerrilla Movement has never 
been proven to be communist,* 
they are “Nationalists” first and 
foremost. We are fighting 'the 
same “United Front” that first 
fought the Japanese, then the 
French — the Viet Minh Guer­
rillas. (D. F. Fleming, Cold War 
and Its Origins). The words Viet 
Cong, literally meaning Viet­
namese Communists, were invent­
ed by some clever Saigon press- 
agent. They are not widely used 
outside of Saigon.
To be sure, the Communists are 
strongly represented in the Guer­
rilla movement. But the same can 
be said of the war-time anti- 
German resistance in France. Is 
it fair to characterize the French 
underground as “communist?” 
This comparison of the “Viet 
Cong” with the war-time French 
underground was noted last week 
by Shunichi Matsumoto, a high
(Continued from Page 1)
iors living in the dormitory. Prob­
lems arise because of the occu­
pants’ opposition to many re­
straints and enforced residence in 
the dormitory; the requirement 
that residents join the board plan; 
and the fact that sororities have 
no dormitory area delegated to 
them.
In discussing the lack of soror­
ity facilities, the report states: 
“This limits the degree of self- 
government and the learning op­
portunities which are so much a 
part of the fraternity system.”
The report also explains why, 
“with only sixty freshman women 
not living in Morewood, it has be­
come feasible to include them In 
the counseling program *ur 
women,’’ and how “it is conceiv­
able that, on occasions such *s 
Freshman Orientation, a group i»f 
this size could be moved into 
Morewood for a few days.”
Suggesting that Carnegie Tesh 
develop a housing philosophy, the 
report explains that: “After a
major evaluation of Carnegie 
Tech in 1954, the examiners ex­
pressed surprise that in an oth««- 
wise superior institution, whfte 
so much attention had been paid 
to the implementation of our basic 
philosophy in curricular areas, 
little effort or expense has been 
employed in implementing this 
philosophy in other aspects of stu­
dent life on campus.”
The report states, “Tech must 
accept the same responsibility for 
creating and structuring the stu­
dent’s p^ra-curricular experience 
as is now accepted for his curric- 
uuar experience.” Tech should no 
longer solve problems in areas 
such as housing in a piecemeal 
and opportunist fashion, guided 
primarily by a dollar-and-cents 
approach.”
Earlier in the report it is stated 
that “dormitories have been built 
at the lowest possible cost p^r 
student and in the planning 
stages, settlements have been 
made for inferior designs and fa­
cilities in order to keep within es­
tablished financial limits.” .
The report also recognizes the 
different housing needs of the dif­
ferent members of the student 
body.
Among the concluding plans for 
long-range improvement is the 
suggestion that “a ‘core’ or ‘house’ 
plan be basic to future housing 
plans.”
Also recognized is the need 
“in the near future,” for an ad­
dition to Skibo containing an 
“attractive dining center, with 
areas for small groups” and 
recreational facilities, and for 
“an auditorium where it (the 
campus) can meet as an aca­
demic community and where H 
can share its cultural and aca­
demic achievements with 
others.”
National Liberation Front) has a 
31 member Central Committee, 
headed by a non-communist law­
yer. Represented in the Central 
Committee are leading Budhist 
priests, Catholic priests, Protestant 
Clergy, small business men and 
three anti-government parties.” 
And as is noted in the same 
article, the program of the N.L.F. 
is for free elections, freedom, 
neutrality and a coalition erovern- 
ment representing all factions and 
divisions of Southvietnamese peo­
ple.
Furthermore, as Eisenhower 
readily admits in his memoirs, the 
guerrillas ar i generally popular. 
He said the reason the United 
States unilaterally took the initia­
tive in breaking the Geneva Ac­
hecord of 1954 by not allowinj 
elections that were to unify the 
country in ’56 was that the people 
in “the know” believed that Ho 
Chi Mink would win, possibly by 
upwards of 80% even in the 
, . ., . ,, , , South. (Eisenhower’s Memoirs, as
ran 'ing ai o e published in the New York Times,
“I Oct. 28, 1963).
Ho Chi Minh was the leader of
Japanese government, after he 
had completed an extraordinary 
Japanese mission to Vietnam, 
Cambodia, and Laos.
Regarding the “Viet Cong,” 
Bertrand Russell says the follow­
ing in the December 1964 issue 
of the Minority Of One: “It (the

tance in Indo-China. He is now

/^tateS did not sign the Geneva 
Accord of 1954, yet nevertheless, 
Eisenhower pledged our govern­
ment to abide by the agreement. 
(Eisenhower’s Memoirs, p. 371). 
Senator Morse has noted the rea­
son the United States failed to be 
a party to the Geneva Accord was 
that when then Secretary of State 
Dulles saw he was not going to 
have his way, “he picked up his 
attache case and stalked . out.” 
..(Source: televised speech in
Cleveland, Ohio, 2/19/65).
Our brutal policy, thus, has no 
justification. We are fighting 
“possibly upwards of 80%” of the 
South Vietnamese people for no 
apparent reason. Vietnam has no 
bearing on American vital inter­
ests as presidential advisor Mc- 
George Bundy recently noted (I. 
F. Stone, Weekly, 3/14/65). Yet 
we are risking a major war in 
What area by deliberately bombing 
Wke sovereign state of North Viet­
nam. This despite the fact we 
have been unable to document an 
invasion by that State on the 
State of South Vietnam. That we ; 
are risking such a war was re- j 
cently noted by DeGaulle when ; 
he said that we (The United j 
States) are heading straight for J 
a war with China, a war which 
DeGaulle stated “on authority,” 
not one of our NATO allies * 
(¿will support. Finally, Sen­
ators Aik?n and Mansfield have 
noted in the Senate that our pre­
sent policy of bombing North 
Vietnam has not had the desired 
effect of stopping the war in the 
South. They note that our policy 
has, as a matter of fact, had the 
reverse effect of hardening the; 
positions of both North Vietnam j 
and the N.L.F. and that it openly 
threatens to bring China directly 
^nto the conflict. (I. F. Stone’s 
Weekly, 4/5/65).
The United States should not be 
in Vietnam. We should get out. 
This was Kennedy’s policy. He 
said he would be out of Vietnam 
by the end of 1965. He started 
withdrawing American forces 
from that country. (It cannot be 
argued that Kennedy was prepar­
ing to win by the end of ’65, be­
cause without any appreciable 
g.mprovement in the military situ­
ation, and it certainly was no 
better then, than now he was 
withdrawing American troops 
from Vietnam. As a matter of fact, 
Major-General Timmes stated we 
would withdraw 1000 troops dur­
ing December ’63 alone.) (New 
York Times 11/16/63).
Unfortunately, President Ken­
nedy W&s killed and snortly there­
after, our commitment jumped by
8,000 men. It now appears to have 
jumped further. Maxwell Taylor, 
American ambassador to South 
Vietnam, recently said we are 
now prepared to escalate the con­
flict without limit. Associated 
Press recently noted that sources 
close to General Johnson, U.S. 
Army Chief-of-Staff, “have re­
ported that items under study in­
cluded commitment of U.S. com­
bat units, increased bombing of 
North Vietnam and even the 
selection of possible targets for 
nuclear bombing.” (I. F. Stone’s 
Weekly, 3/23/65).
America: Let us return to the 
policy of Kennedy before it is too 
late to turn back. Fellow Ameri­
cans, write your Senators! Write 
to the President! Urge total and 
immediate withdrawal of Ameri­
can troops from Vietnam and the 
termination of ever-enlarging air 
and sea attacks against North 
Vietnam.
Really! Is Vietnam worth nu­
clear war?

Steve r—
(Continued from Page 1) 
“Not enough students get in the 
driver’s seat of their education.” 
He emphasized the need for 
students to expand their aca­
demic horizons, and encouraged 
students to take courses outside 
of their field.
When asked how his admini­
stration stands on the “publish- 
perish” controversy, Dr. Stever 
explained that although the con­
troversy has been overused and 
oversimplified, faculty publication 
still remains a good indication 
that a professor is “staying alive 
in his field.” Dr. Stever empha­
sized that an education at CIT 
“won’t stand up unless CIT re­
tains its excellent faculty.”
The teaching faculty member 
has two jobs, said Dr. Stever,” 
to teach students, and to remain 
on top of his field.”
“Some teachers would never 
publish a thing,” said Dr. Stever, 
“yet still be up to date, but how 
do you know.” The best indicator 
is to “read what he has written.” 
When asked what he thought of 
classroom observation, Dr. Stever 
quoted a law of physics: “A sys­
tem observed is a system disturb­
ed.”

Page 8 — CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN — Tuesday, April 13, 1965
Tech Tops Indiana 87-53;
Macosko and Cairns Star
Grads and ATO Dominate IM Swim Meet
by Chuck Beard
Tartan track coach Ed Vamos had a birthday last week* 
and the Tech thinclads, gave him the best present they could 
think of — an 87-53 romp over Indiana State College last 
Saturday at Indiana. ?
The Tartans thus avenged a 
narrow loss to Indiana last year, 
and also chalked up their second 
victory in two starts this year.
Tech’s best performances 
Were again turned in by Chris 
Macosko and Roger Cairns, 
who scored twelve points 
apiece. Macosko took first in 
the 880, with a fine 2:03.9 
time; tied for first in the mile; 
and took second in the two- 
mile. Cairns, on the other 
hand, took first in the two- 
mile with a good early season 
time of 10:25.2, tied for first 
in the mile, and took second 
in the 880.
School record-holder Tony Wil­
liams came close to topping his 
two-year old pole-vault mark of 
12'-9". Williams topped 12'-6", 
but missed at 13'-0" three times.
With such excellent showings in 
the first two meets, however, it 
won’t be too much of a surprise 
if the pole-vault mark is broken 
this season.
Bob Livengood, last year’s IM 
sprint champ, finally showed signs 
of rounding into shape. Livengood 
turned in a fine (considering the 
condition of the track) time of 
23.0 in the 220. If Livengood con­
tinues to improve, Tech will again 
have a threat in the sprints.
A re-shuffled mile-relay team 
took its second straight victory 
with a respectable time of 3:39.6.
John Polles, as lead-off man, ran 
a fine quarter and opened up a 
lead that never diminished as 
Jerry Pack, Tom Terpack, and 
Paul Denberg increased Polles’ 
opening lead.
Yesterday the Tartans trav­
eled to Westminster to battle 
the Titans. Westminster, as 
always, is tough this year, but 
the Tartans were confident of 
victory. Action resumes the 
Saturday after Easter, with 
Tech meeting Waynesburg and 
St. Francis in a triangular 
meet, at 1:30, at Tech Sta­
dium.

The school IM swimming meet 
was more of a dual meet between 
ATO and the GRADS. It was a 
battle all the way down to the 
wire even though the GRADS 
were favored to win by a land­
slide. After the final count, the 
GRADS had puled out the win 
with ATO right behind them.
The GRADS posted firsts in six 
of the nine events; however, they 
had no seconds. The big men for 
the GRADS were CYecine and 
Kadner, both taking two firsts. 
Also contributing was Worchter, 
who placed first in the 50 yd. 
breast stroke. In addition, the 
GRADS also took the 150 yd. 
medley relay, barely defeating 
ATO.
The man behind ATO was 
Randy French, who took firsts in 
the 50 yd. free style and the 100 
yd. free style. French also anch­
ored the winning 200 yd. free style 
relay and the second place 150 
yd. medley relay. Two ATO 
pledges, Bell and West, proved 
themselves valuable by taking 
seconds in the 50 yd. butterfly and 
the 50 yd. breast stroke, respec­
tively.
Only one other fraternity made 
a showing. Webster of SN man­
aged a tie with French in the 50 
yd. free style, and SN turned in a 
distant second in the 200 yd. free 
style relay.
Tech Golfers Win First Two Matches
by Dale Johnson
The Carnegie Tech golf team 
opened its season last week in an 
impresive fashion with two easy 
victories.
On April 6, the Tartans trav­
eled to Waynesburg College for 
the opening match of the season. 
Tech, with only three lettermen 
returning from last year’s squad, 
swept to a 6-1 victory. Victors for 
Tech in its first encounter were 
junior letterman Dale Johnson, 
sophomore lettermen John Mul- 
holland and Bob Blazier, and 
freshmen Bill Habel and Bill Fair- 
man. Tech’s lone loser was Dave 
Prengamen. Medalist honors went 
to Johnson with 83, followed by 
Mulhollanc’ with 85 and Habel 
with 87.
In their second match of the 
season last Friday, the Tartans 
scored another win with a 7-2 vic­
tory over St. Vincent College. 
Winners in the single match play 
competition were Johnson, Mul- 
holland, Blazier, Habel, and Fair- 
man. Tech’s other two points 
were won in team match play by 
the team of Johnson and Mulhol- 
land and the team of Habel and 
Fairman. Medalist honors went to 
Mulholland with 78, followed by 
Johnson with 80, Habel with 84, 
and Blazier with 85.
