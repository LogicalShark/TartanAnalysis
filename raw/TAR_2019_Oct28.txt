Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the 
research is turned over to the 
press of?ces “who decide what

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

Pittsburgh sits on the Marcellus 
Shale, one of the largest deposits 
of natural gas in the United 
States. This past Wednesday, 
President Trump delivered the 
keynote address at Shale Insight, 
a conference hosted by the 
Marcellus Shale Coalition, the 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and 
the West Virginia Oil and Natural 
Gas Association. 
This marks his second visit to 
the region in the past months, 
after his Aug. rally at the Shell 
cracker plant in Beaver County.
The Shale Insights conference 
was attended largely by those 
working in natural gas. In his 
remarks, Trump emphasized his 
support for the industry, citing 
the rollback of environmental 
regulations and withdrawal from 
the Paris Climate Accords. 
The keynote address was 
open to the public, with a section 
cordoned off to create space for 
a rally in the back, and Trump 
addressed some of the activat-
ing issues for his supporters, 
including re-upping his claim that 
he is working for “Pittsburgh, not 
Paris.”
Indigenous activists and anti-
fracking groups gathered at 
Point State Park and held a water 
ceremony in the Ohio River before 
marching into downtown for a 
second Defend the Water rally 
in protest of the conference. The 
rally was intended to “address 
the destructive impacts of the 
petrochemical industry build-
out in the Ohio River Valley 
and beyond on people and the 
environment,” according to the 
website of Breath Project, one of 
the rally’s co-organizers.
The protests expanded beyond 
an opposition to fracking, many 
focusing on Trump himself. 14 
protesters, holding a sign that 
read “Our solidarity will defeat 
white nationalism,” were arrested 
for blocking a ramp from the Fort 
Pitt Bridge near the convention 
center where the conference was 
being held.

During the ?rst-ever Tartan 
Community Day, students 
attended a presentation on the 
results of a multi-year study on 
personal well-being among the 
Carnegie Mellon student body, 
gathering together and enjoying 
ice cream sandwiches in the 
Rangos Ballroom. The presen-
tation was given by David Cre-
swell, a professor in Dietrich 
College’s psychology department 
and principal investigator for the 
project they call Life@CMU.
“This project is so distinctly 
CMU,” President Jahanian stated, 
describing the project as being 
centered on science and data 
analytics to improve student 
wellbeing. “The Life@CMU 
study illuminates the nuanced 
ecosystem of individuals, 
traditions, culture, that make up 
our community. It has allowed 
us to better understand the CMU 
experience and draw on the data 
that’s collected to in?uence our 
interventions, programs, and 
resources.”
Concluding his introductory 
statement, Jahanian added, “I 
want all of you to know that no 
one is immune to feeling alone 
or vulnerable at times… not even 
your president. But in moments of 
uncertainty we must remember 
that we are a community. There is 
an incredible network of support 
that surrounds us. Use it. Lean 
on one another. This is one of the 
most profound ways in which we 
can act as a community and also 
thrive as individuals.”
Creswell described the 
goals of the project as an at-
tempt to “better understand the 
culture at Carnegie Mellon, the 
stress culture… we wanted to 
understand stress, we wanted 
to understand mental health 
and sleep patterns here in our 
students so we can better help our 
students, with their health and 
academic success.”
Before going into the Carnegie 
Mellon-speci?c results, Creswell 
provided context for the grow-
ing mental health problems 
in our broader society. As an 
example, he pointed to ?ndings 
from a study that tracked mental 
health outcomes of a nationally 
representative sample of people 
in the U.S. that found there was 
a 50 percent increase in ma-
jor depression diagnoses from 
2009 to 2017 among younger 
Americans.
Phase I of the Life@CMU 
project followed a sample of ?rst-
year students over the course of 
the 2017 spring semester. The 
following spring Phase II tracked 
?rst-year and sophomore students 
over the semester as well. They 
were able to track 85 students 
who participated in both phases 
to examine their transition from 
being ?rst-years to sophomores.
They gathered data on factors 
of students’ well-being and

“She was one of those students 
who was smarter than the teacher, 
and the teacher knew it but 
wouldn’t say it out loud,” confessed 
Jim Daniels, English Professor 
at Carnegie Mellon and former 
teacher of author Sarah Valentine. 
Daniels showered Valentine with 
praise before her MLK Jr. Day 
Writing Awards speech on her life 
story and autobiographical book, 
When I Was White: A Memoir.
During her time at Carnegie 
Mellon, Valentine was a part of 
the English Department and the 
Modern Languages department, 
where she studied Russian as an 
undergraduate. She graduated in 
2000.
Valentine’s speech was held last 
Thursday in the Center for Student 
Diversity and Inclusion. Setting 
the stage for Valentine’s speech, 
M. Shernell Smith, Associate 
Director at the Of?ce of the Dean 
of Student Affairs, said, “there are 
times in this room where you really 
don’t know who’s who. It’s good 
because we can create this sense of 
connection.”
“I graduated almost 20 years 
ago, and it’s great to see how much 
the university has grown in terms 
of its engagement with diversity. 
Even then, the English department 
was ahead of the curve. The MLK 
writing awards program started 
when I was a student,” Valentine 
said.
Valentine thanked Daniels for 
his praise. She also thanked him 
for being an important mentor to 
her at Carnegie Mellon. Much of 
her speech and memoirs from her 
book focused on her senior year at 
Carnegie Mellon.
When I Was White and the 
speech she gave at the MLK writing 
awards focused on Valentine’s 
struggles with racial identity 
throughout her life. Raised in an 
Irish-Italian household by her 
biological mother’s family and 
stepdad, Valentine was expected to 
conform to her European identity 
by her mother and was unaware 
that her father was a black man. 
Valentine has had to grapple with 
her African-American identity 
after believing she was white 
growing up.
Recounting a Saint Patrick’s 
day festival from her college years, 
Valentine said she told her friends 
that she was Irish, to which they 
responded, “Yeah, everyone’s Irish 
on Saint Patrick’s day!” Valentine 
told the audience that, though her 
friends saw her as other, she felt 
connected to her Irish identity, 
and she was terri?ed to confront 
this difference she had with her 
friends.
Valentine also told the 
audience about how she stole an 
Irish heritage ring from a vendor 
at the festival, later tossing it 
on the ground out of guilt and 
abandoning it. A guard searched 
her to no avail when she was re-
ported for it, and Valentine told the 
crowd that her friends thought she 
was being racially pro?led.
Valentine wanted to confess 
about the ring badly, and she 
?nally got her chance in Daniels’ 
poetry class where she got to write 
about the incident. She joyfully 
recalled her time as a student with 
Daniels.
“Jim showed me what it was 
like to be a poet in real life. He was 
such a regular guy,” Valentine said, 
laughing. “That’s a good thing. He 
was a family man, no one crazy, 
who was able to show me he could 
be a good writer. It let me know 
I could be myself and be a good 
writer.”
Valentine also told the 
audience a few heart-wrenching 
anecdotes from her childhood. 
She commented on how she 
was expected to look and act 
white, and one aspect of this was 
straightening her hair. Once her 
mother ironed her hair, painfully 
burning her scalp.
“I ended up admiring the white 
girls at my school for their hair. 
I fell into the role of the well-
behaved, well-groomed daughter 
to satisfy my parents and other 
adults. I felt like I was in a struggle 
to please people as a little girl and 
be myself at the same time.”
“White people had been asking 
me questions about my identity 
my whole life and accepted 
whatever answer I gave them. I was 
constantly questioned about my 
hair, family, and ethnicity. I had few 
black people in her life, and I felt as 
though I’d been hiding behind my 
whiteness,” said Valentine.
During the Q&A session, 
Valentine revealed to the audience 
that she has yet to ?gure out who 
her biological father is. “I had 
searched before but decided to 
suspend the search because of 
how much energy it took. I came to 
accept that I didn’t need someone 
else to validate who I was. I’m still 
interested, but it’s not something I 
need to know to move on with my 
life.”
Many of Valentine’s friends 
and family were in the audience, 
and they mentioned that talk-
ing about Valentine’s dad during 
her childhood was very much off 
limits. Valentine described her 
current relationship with her mom 
as being a “truce,” and she says she 
has forgiven her parents, who now 
recognize her African-American 
identity.
After Valentine’s speech, 
Daniels talked with The Tartan 
about his time as Valentine’s 
teacher. From 1998 to 2000, 
Valentine was in every one of 
Daniels’ poetry workshops. She 
also participated in a mentoring 
program Daniels did with high 
school students at the Pittsburgh 
High School for the Creative and 
Performing Arts.
“In class, she wasn’t the stu-
dent who spoke the most, but 
when she spoke, she was able to 
read the subtleties and nuances 
of poems with amazing depth and 
insight. She had a warmth and 
generosity of spirit that set the 
tone for the class and allowed the 
other students to be both frank 
and empathetic with each other,” 
Daniels said.
“When I ?rst read When I Was 
White, I found myself underlining 
and starring passages just like I 
did when she was my student. On 
a sentence-by-sentence level, her 
writing really sings. It’s not just 
the unusual, provocative story she 
has to tell, but the skillful way that 
she tells it that makes the book so 
special.”
Sarah Valentine, author and Carnegie Mellon alumna from the class of 2000, reads from her new memoir in the Cohon Center.

ForAllSecure, CMU spinoff company, expanding DoD partnerships
CYNTHIA WU
Junior Staffwriter
After winning a prestigious 
DARPA competition in 2016, 
ForAllSecure, a Pittsburgh-based 
company launched by Carnegie 
Mellon faculty, has expanded 
its collaborations with U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD). 
Their products help the DoD detect 
vulnerabilities in software at 
machine speed and scale.
According to the U.S. Govern-
ment Accountability Of?ce (GAO), 
as weapon systems become more 
and more computerized, there 
are “more opportunities for at-
tacks.” A 2017 DoD contract with 
ForAllSecure aims to be a solu-
tion to this problem, improving 
weapon systems security with the 
company’s “Mayhem” product, 
which is an assisted-intelligence 
behavior testing solution that can 
automatically detect and eliminate 
vulnerabilities in software.
ForAllSecure was founded in 
2014 by David Brumley, a Carnegie 
Mellon electrical and computer 
engineering professor, along-
side Thanassis Avgerinos and 
Alex Rebert, both graduates and 
researchers from Carnegie Mellon. 
Mayhem, ForAllSecure’s ?agship 
cybersecurity system, initially 
began as a project from Brumley’s 
Carnegie Mellon research group.
Chelsea Mastilak, a 
spokesperson for the company, 
told The Tartan in a phone 
interview that the company was 
started largely on the idea that 
“cybersecurity plays a huge role in 
making the country safe.”
ForAllSecure started with a 
prototype of Mayhem, which was 
much more productive than previ-
ous machines, said the company.
In 2016, with the Mayhem 
system developed, ForAllSecure 
entered the Cyber Grand Challenge 
(CGC), a competition created by 
DARPA in correspondence with the 
DEF CON hacker convention. One 
of seven teams that participated 
in the competition, ForAllSecure 
eventually won the competi-
tion after showing its strong 
auto-correcting power in ?xing 
vulnerabilities in software in front 
of a crowd of over 5000 computer 
security professionals.
After winning the competition, 
ForAllSecure signed a contract 
with the Defense Innovation 
Unit, an organization under the 
DoD which aims to implement 
emerging technology into the U.S. 
military by contracting with start-
ups and companies.
According to a 2018 U.S. GAO 
Report of and studies performed 
by Carnegie Mellon’s Software 
Engineering Institute, nearly all 
previous weapon systems had some 
sort of vulnerabilities. However, 
only one out of 20 of those vulner-
abilities were corrected previously. 
Seeking to “automate the process 
[of ?nding and correcting vulner-
abilities in software] for modern 
developers”, ForAllSecure signed 
an $8 million contract with the 
DIU to help eliminate these defects 
in weapon systems.
Besides its great power in 
automatically checking for 
vulnerabilities, Mayhem also 
“uncovers defects with zero 
false positives,” according to 
the company’s website. Alex 
Rebert, one of the co-founders of 
ForAllSecure, said that they were 
able to achieve such precision by 
emphasizing reproduction in or-
der to enhance the system. “The 
analysis engine runs the test case 
three times to verify that it is able 
to reproduce the same behavior,” 
Rebert said.
Mastilak says that ForAllSecure 
has completed the three stages of 
their contract with the DIU and is 
currently working on collaboration 
projects with individual clients 
from DoD. She notes that more 
clients in the DoD, not limited to 
the DIU in general, are interested 
in implementing Mayhem.
Life@CMU report ?nds campus is indeed stressed out
Mellon doctoral student in Civil 
and Environmental Engineering, 
“didn’t see any” protests as she 
presented her research around 
modeling extraction-related 
earthquakes at the conference’s 
research showcase. To Karimi, the 
conference was an opportunity to 
talk to people in the industry about 
projects in natural gas extraction.
Karimi said that her experi-
ence of the conference was “not 
that different” from past events 
since keynote speakers are mostly 
presidents and vice presidents of 
shale and gas companies who also 
are important decision-makers in 
the oil and gas industry.
The protests did reach inside 
the conference. Eight protest-
ers from the progressive Jewish 
activist group, Bend the Arc, began 
a chant of “Trump endangers 
Jews” during the keynote ad-
dress, and were subsequently 
removed. The conference was just 
a couple days shy of the one year 
anniversary of the Tree of Life 
shooting, something the protesters 
referenced in a statement on the 
organization’s website.
“Don’t hurt him, please. They 
don’t know they’re dealing with 
very tough people in this room,” 
responded Trump.
Isabella Mahal, a ?rst-year 
political science major at the 
University of Pittsburgh, attended 
the rally with the intent of causing 
some sort of disruption. She and 
her friend, fellow Pitt student 
Keri-Anne Laing, had been 
Googling chants on their phone 
when they heard the Bend the Arc 
group and decided to join in.
Mahal’s interactions with 
Trump supporters in the ?rst 
part of the rally had been mostly 
apolitical. She likened them to 
conversations she may have had 
with neighbors back home in 
Colorado. Once she joined the 
protest, however, she said watched 
some of the same “faces who I had 
been seeing, they were smiling at 
us, dancing,” yelling and jeering at 
them and the other protesters.
“It was de?nitely [a] moment 
of real fear about if in fact, I did 
not know what I had walked into. 
And I think that that hit me in 
that moment. The thought that 
immediately followed that was, 
this is what people my age, this is 
what people younger than me live 
with every day,” when they are 
unable to pretend, because of their 
race or gender presentation, that 
they might ?t in at a Trump rally, 
said Mahal. Since she could pass 
as a straight, white Republican, 
Mahal said that this experience 
reinforced her belief that she has 
a responsibility to “leverage her 
privilege” and protest.
“I liked everything Trump was 
saying, but I didn’t like the crowd,” 
said Andrew Hutner, a ?fth-year 
in mechanical engineering who 
supported Trump in the 2016 
election. He didn’t think the 
disruption was productive, but also 
didn’t like the crowd’s reaction.
“Trump has a polarizing 
effect,” says Hutner. His main 
takeaway from the rally was that 
“everyone needs to calm down.” 
At Carnegie Mellon, Hutner 
says he doesn’t have many politi-
cal conversations. He thinks that 
most students at Carnegie Mellon 
are not very politically involved, 
which he says is “one of the 
reasons I like CMU.”
President Trump met with both protest and support in Pittsburgh

experiences, including sleep, 
stress, depression, loneliness, 
and life satisfaction, looking at 
students’ baseline scores at the 
beginning though the end of each 
semester. They also used Fitbit 
sensor data and phone information 
to sample for patterns in usage and 
activities over time.
The Life@CMU study also 
used experience sampling on 
participants’ phones to survey 
what students are doing during 
their waking hours, ?nding that on 
average 50 percent of that time is 
dedicated to school-related work. 
Students also used 29 percent 
of their waking hours for what 
Creswell described as the “catch-
all” category of personal time, 9 
percent on eating, 6 percent on 
naps, and 4 percent on exercise. 
Students also reportedly spent an 
average of three hours on their 
phones per day, which many peo-
ple at the event were surprised 
wasn’t higher.
“A lot of this is tip of the iceberg 
stuff that I think is really important 
and can generate some important 
conversation around what the 
CMU experience is like,” Creswell 
explained.
They found that 8 percent 
of the Phase I students at their 
pre-semester baseline showed 
high-risk stress scores, but that 
escalated to 58 percent of stu-
dents by ?nals week. Additionally, 
Creswell says there is a “ratcheting 
up” of stress scores for students go-
ing into their second spring semes-
ters compared to their ?rst spring, 
with pre-semester stress scores be-
ing higher among sophomore than 
?rst-year students.
Following the same trend with 
depressive symptoms among 
students, the project found that 
34 percent of Phase I participants 
had been scored at high risk for 
major depression diagnosis at the 
beginning of the semester, but 
by ?nals week 58 percent of par-
ticipants scored as being high risk. 
Creswell explained then explained 
that while the measurement they 
used “is not diagnostic of whether 
you have a major depression diag-
nosis, but it’s a really important 
predictor” for ?nding who may be 
at risk.
When they measured loneliness 
they found that it was consistently 
high throughout the semester, 
leading to likely increases in stress 
and depression. Creswell made 
note that “if you come into the 
semester with high loneliness 
scores it predicts you having 
increasing depression over time.” 
He also acknowledged that the 
high levels of loneliness surprised 
them as they expected the college 
environment would run counter to 
loneliness.
Creswell stated that he wants 
to talk more about loneliness and 
that we should start a dialogue on 
trying to understand loneliness 
among younger adults, especially 
noting why it might be higher than 
among other generations.
Based on the results of the study, 
one of the narratives Creswell is 
trying to adjust is that Carnegie 
Mellon has a unique stress culture. 
“I think there’s a lot of stress, but 
I don’t see anything that suggests 
that our stress culture may look 
a whole lot different than other 
college student cultures,” he said.
Depression levels in Carnegie 
Mellon, Creswell stated, are 
“similar depression scores to other 
college samples… nonetheless, 
we’ve still been really concerned.” 
This same similarity can be seen in 
student’s loneliness scores as well.
One of Creswell’s main “myths” 
that he was trying to dispel with 
this presentation was of sleep. 
While the Life@CMU team found 
that the average of students’ per-
ceptions for amount of sleep was 
5.6 hours, CMU students were 
found to actually have closer to 7 
hours per night.
As the audience laughed at a 
sleep graph that showing a spike in 
the average amount during spring 
break, the professor explained 
they didn’t ?nd much variance 
in students’ sleep amounts and 
schedules. Creswell then showed 
that they found the average sleep 
time to be at 2:23 a.m. and the 
average wake time at 9:30 a.m. He 
did stress here that these variables 
are predictive of “mental health 
and GPA-type outcomes.”
It appears that the mental 
health situation of Carnegie Mellon 
students is more complicated, 
however, as the project team 
found that life satisfaction scores 
returned with fairly high scores 
in comparison to other colleges’ 
scores. 
“How is it that students could 
be carrying these depression bur-
dens, particularly as you ramp up 
over the course of the semester, 
but also say that I have gratitude 
and purpose in life?” Creswell 
asked.
He answers that the students 
he’s spoken to on this have told 
him, “This makes sense. I wouldn’t 
trade being at CMU for anything, 
but I’m dealing with a lot of these 
mental health challenges.”
Outlining next steps, Creswell 
explained how members of the 
Life@CMU Project have also 
been using machine learning to 
predict a student’s depression 
risk. Additional research currently 
under review shows that they 
can predict “end-of-semester” 
depression with about 85.7 
percent accuracy. The professor 
stated, “Some of the work we’ve 
been doing shows that even in the 
?rst two weeks sensing data can 
predict with reasonable accuracy 
who’s likely to be ratcheting up a 
level in terms of their depression 
symptoms.”
The project has begun Phase 
III intervention study for ?rst-year 
students to examine strategies for 
improving resilience. Creswell 
himself will also begin teaching a 
“Hack Your Life” course for future 
?rst-year Dietrich College students 
in the fall.
As a ?nal call to action, Creswell 
emphasized the importance of 
preparing Carnegie Mellon for 
future at risk students, showing 
results from a study that found 
the rate of pediatric emergency 
room visits for suicidal ideation or 
attempts has doubled over the past 
decade. “We really need to think 
about ways to support each other 
and to create an institution where 
we can minimize those who are 
really struggling with this.”
Creswell describing the 
message of the Life@CMU Project 
as twofold: “First, I do think it’s 
one of hope. We’re seeing high 
happiness and purpose in life in our 
students and really an increasing 
greater availability of mental 
health resources and initiatives on 
campus.”
However, echoing Jahanian’s 
comments, Creswell said, “I also 
think that the second part of it 
is that this work is really a call to 
action among every one of us here. 
We need to be proactive about 
helping our current students with 
their mental health and wellness 
and hopefully this work really 
accelerates our efforts our students 
and thus future generations of 
students.”

Turkish-Kurdish con?ict persistsPublic space used for a ‘private event’
ATAHAN KILICCOTE
Staffwriter
On Oct. 10, the Turkish 
military stormed over the 
Syrian border into Kurdish 
controlled lands and began 
solidifying their control over 
a “buffer” region to allegedly 
prevent terror attacks. This 
came after the U.S. military 
pulled out of several military 
bases on Oct. 6. Many Kurds 
felt that this U.S. withdrawal 
was a betrayal of the Obama era 
promises of implicit support for 
an independent Kurdish state.
As a Turkish-American dual 
citizen, the Turkish invasion 
of Kurdish controlled lands 
in Syria does not surprise me. 
Turkish-Kurdish racial tension 
goes back to the formation of 
the modern Turkish state and 
has only been exacerbated 
by the invention of social 
media. We’ve all heard of the 
1915 Armenian Genocide, 
which Turkey still denies, but 
countless Kurds were also 
massacred in the same period. 
In the 1920s, when Turkey 
fought for its independence 
from Greek and British 
imperialism following World 
War I, the Kurds also rose up. 
Between 1922 and 1931, there 
were four major Kurdish revolts 
in eastern Turkey. In 1927, 
the most significant Kurdish 
revolt, the Ararat Rebellion, 
established an independent 
Kurdish state for three years. 
The revolt was crushed by the 
Turkish military. According to 
the Turkish Communist Party, 
between 1925 and 1938, more 
than 1.5 million Kurds were 
deported and massacred. The 
book People Without a Country: 
The Kurds and Kurdistan, 
written and published in 
France in 1980, describes the 
history of the Kurds. The book 
lays out that villages were 
razed to repress the Kurdish 
population and that, to prevent 
these events from harming 
Turkey’s international image 
and reputation, foreigners 
were excluded from the entire 
area east of Euphrates until 
1965.
The Turkish constitution, 
enacted in 1924, endeavored 
to ethnoculturally unite the 
country under a distinctly 
western Turkish identity. 
This was done by repressing 
specifically Arab and Kurdish 
minority cultures. The Turkish 
language was “Westernized” 
and purged of Arab influences. 
The Kurdish language was 
banned, the words ‘Kurds’ and 
‘Kurdistan’ were removed from 
dictionaries and history books, 
and the Kurds were referred to 
as “Mountain Turks.” Further, 
until 1991 a law outlawed the 
use of non-Turkish language 
in public communications like 
music, radio, and literature. 
Education of foreign, non-
Turkish, language was strictly 
regulated.
In the 1970s the Partiya 
Karkerên Kurdistanê (PKK), 
the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, 
was formed demanding an 
independent Kurdish state. 
In 1984, PKK members began 
attacking Turkish military 
targets which expanded into 
terror attacks on civilians, 
including mass shootings and 
suicide bombings. Since 1984, 
37,000 people have been killed 
in this conflict.
Long-lasting ethnic conflict 
between Turks and Kurds, 
compounded by government 
censorship and organized 
suppression, has created a 
strong separation in heritage 
and traditions. Generally — 
especially in poorer, more 
nationalistic demographics 
— Turks think of Kurds as a 
separate, lower ethnic class. 
Turkish firms do not make an 
effort to hire Kurds, and there 
is no affirmative action like in 
the U.S.
This separation and conflict 
have been strip-mined for all its 
political usefulness by the AKP, 
the Justice and Development 
Party and the party of the 
current leader Erdogan. The 
AKP voices racial-nationalist 
narratives that are akin to the 
U.S. alt-right. They also create 
social media propaganda. 
With a 62 percent smartphone 
market penetration, Turkey 
is a modernized and 
technological society with 
more Islamic cultural values 
than Western Enlightenment 
values, especially in the rural 
east. After a recent anti-AKP 
protest, the AK Trolls, a state-
sponsored social media task 
force, was created to spread 
misinformation on the internet. 
They have been widely 
successful in stirring nationalist 
fervor and xenophobic hatred 
in a culture already steeped in 
ethnic conflict and genocide 
denial, spreading the narrative 
that all Kurds, even women, 
and children refugees, are 
terrorists, that they hate 
Turkish people, and that they 
would destroy the Turkish 
nation if given the opportunity.
Where the conflict will lead 
is difficult to predict, but the 
Turkish government does not 
have a good track record on 
human rights abuses. Erdogan’s 
recent approval ratings are yet 
to be reported, but the previous 
year had the lowest rating in 
his presidency. But the fact 
remains clear that the U.S. 
withdrawal from the region 
has implicitly given the Turkish 
military the green light on 
their occupation of the Syrian 
border region. If that leads into 
a wider ethnic cleansing, then 
it is Trump’s and our fault for 
allowing these ethnic groups to 
come into a wider conflict.

Last Thursday, as I was 
walking to my class in Tepper, 
I was stopped by a Carnegie 
Mellon police officer and told 
to go a different way. The first 
floor of Tepper was closed for a 
private event.
I tried to access the first floor 
via the front stairwell, the one 
with the wood laminate steps 
that turn into relatively fishy 
places to sit and study. When I 
approached, the officer told me, 
“Sorry, the stairwell is closed.” 
What does that even mean? 
I explained that I had a class 
downstairs in the Kenner Room, 
but he said I’d have to go to the 
elevators or the back stairs.
Literally five minutes 
before, I walked down the main 
stairwell in Newell-Simon from 
the fifth floor to the fourth 
and nobody stopped me, even 
though there was a panel taking 
place in the cafe space right 
there.
Having the main floor of 
Tepper close wouldn’t have 
been as infuriating as it was, 
except that they stationed 
police officers at every entrance 
to the “private event” and the 
25th anniversary of Human-
Computer Interaction Institute 
(the event in Newell-Simon 
Hall) was totally public. It was 
also slightly infuriating that 
every time I walked by outside, 
nobody was actually using the 
first-floor space of Tepper, but I 
chalked that up to poor timing 
on my part.
Now this space in Tepper has 
always been a little weird. Once 
I had a friend put their feet up 
on a footrest sized table, but 
they were discourteously told 
to put their feet down. And all 
the signs that say to not eat in 
the space constitute some weird 
sort of Victorian morality that 
suggests to incoming students 
that the people they see aren’t 
actually human. Because that’s 
what the space is supposed 
to be used for: selling the 
school to visiting students. 
I mean really, who wants to 
come to Carnegie Mellon and 
see students relaxing? If the 
counterargument runs that the 
food will make a mess, do we 
not trust students to clean up 
after themselves? If so, then 
who are you admitting to this 
school?
Back to the point at hand, the 
closing of the first floor Tepper 
space for a “private event” was 
the last straw for me in a long 
line of actions done to make me 
realize how much of a second 
class citizen I am now that I’m 
attending the school, not a 
potential consumer. Our school 
took space for all students — 
an extremely open study space, 
with glass walls to give it a 
public appearance — and much 
like those glass walls, made it 
only appear to be public.
They want the appearance 
of a happy, healthy community. 
They have silver coffee pots 
and an extensive assortment of 
fruit and charcuterie. They have 
those cool tables where you 
stand to eat, like in a cocktail 
hour. But then come the 
police officers, preventing the 
undesirables from entering the 
space. After all, the people for 
whom the event was held don’t 
really want to see students. 
They’re gross and have boogers.
Now, taking a public study 
space for a private event isn’t 
really the problem. The college 
and individual departments do 
it all the time. However, there 
is usually a clear process for 
those actions. It’s not an opaque 
process where bureaucratic 
forces restrict who uses the 
space; student organizations 
are allowed to rent rooms, too. 
A club can rent McConomy 
just as much as any individual 
department or administrative 
power, and there is a hierarchy 
present, but a reasonable 
one that gives preference to 
events with a high, common 
educational or professional 
value. After that, it’s on a first-
come-first-serve basis.
The issue with taking the 
first floor of Tepper for a private 
event is the lack of transparency 
in taking the public space. 
And then, to station police 
officers at the entrance only 
doubles down on that lack of 
transparency. There is no public 
recourse for this taking, and the 
appearance of Carnegie Mellon 
police is degrading, not only to 
the students who become forced 
to move and change locations to 
accommodate a “private event,” 
but to the police officers who 
surely have better things to do 
with their time than deter kids 
from walking through the first 
floor.
I could still use parts of the 
first floor, really. The gym was 
still open, and I could still get 
to my class without issue, other 
than getting a little lost finding 
the other stairwell. The space 
that was closed from access was 
the Coulter Welcome Center. 
Stationing police officers to 
prevent access to that space 
isn’t exactly welcoming.

NLRB puts unions in jeopardy
GRADUATE STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Special to The Tartan
Last month, the National 
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 
proposed a rule change that 
directly impacts graduate 
students at private universities, 
like our very own Carnegie 
Mellon University. The proposed 
rule would establish that 
graduate assistants at private 
universities are not employees, 
and therefore do not have the 
right to engage in collective 
bargaining, i.e., the right to 
unionize. While the Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA) does not 
take a speci?c stance on whether 
Carnegie Mellon graduate 
assistants should unionize, 
we do believe that graduate 
assistants at private universities 
are statutory employees for the 
purpose of the National Labor 
Relations Act, and should have 
the right to unionize.
The NLRB, subject to the 
winds of national politics, has 
changed its position on graduate 
student unionization three times 
in the past two decades. Most 
recently, in 2016, the NLRB 
ruled that graduate student 
workers at Columbia University 
have the right to unionize. 
This has been a contentious 
?ght, with NLRB adjudicating 
multiple cases between 1951 
and 2016 that decided whether 
students performing work 
for the university, especially 
teaching and research assistants, 
are employees. A majority of 
current NLRB members justify 
the proposed rule as a means 
to “bring stability to an area of 
federal labor law in which the 
[NLRB], through adjudication, 
has reversed its approach three 
times since 2000.” However, 
dissenting member Lauren 
McFerran rightly stated, “student 
employees are workers, with 
workers’ interests and workers’ 
rights. There is no good basis — 
in law, in policy, or in fact — to 
take their rights away…through 
organizing and collective 
bargaining student employees 
have achieved better pay, health 
insurance, childcare, and more 
— without harming the academic 
prerogatives of the universities 
they serve.”
Item ?ve of our Legislative 
Platform (rati?ed by the GSA 
General Body) states that the GSA 
“supports the right of graduate 
student employees to unionize.” 
We believe it is the right of 
graduate student employees at 
Carnegie Mellon to determine 
whether or not they want to 
engage in collective bargaining, 
which would only emerge 
through a potential vote on our 
campus. We believe that there is 
a legitimate claim to the title of 
‘worker’ for graduate assistants, 
evident in the responsibilities 
of teaching classes, grading 
papers, and conducting research 
at the direction of the faculty 
and the administration. In fact, 
many lawmakers agree that 
graduate assistants are statutory 
employees. As Congressman Mike 
Doyle, who represents Pittsburgh 
in Congress, put it, “graduate 
students are instructing courses 
and leading groundbreaking 
research. They are employees 
as much as students — and the 
recent decision that they do 
not have the right to advocate 
for fair compensation and 
rights downplays their valuable 
contributions to our universities.” 
In addition, we believe that there 
should not be separate rules 
governing students at private 
vs. public universities (who have 
the right to unionize based on 
state laws, including those in 
Pennsylvania). In 2016, GSA, as 
an interested party in the matter 
of The Trustees of Columbia 
University in the City of New 
York and Graduate Workers of 
Columbia–GWC, UAW, supported 
students’ claim for recognition 
as statutory employees in an 
Amicus Curiae brief ?led by 
the National Association of 
Graduate-Professional Students.
The GSA’s approach to 
this issue is multifaceted and 
includes seeking allies in other 
organizations and institutions, 
compiling a public comment, and 
?nding champions in Congress 
to legislate this issue. With this 
aim in mind, we are drafting a 
public comment with graduate 
students at MIT and other 
private institutions and reaching 
out to allies including the 
American Federation of Teachers 
and the American Association of 
University Professors. We are also 
asking members of Congress to 
amend the legislation governing 
labor rules to apply consistent 
rules for students at private and 
public institutions.
Again, the GSA does not take 
a stance on whether Carnegie 
Mellon graduate assistants 
should unionize, but we believe 
that it is important to have the 
right to do so. Simply put, the 
choice should be left to the 
graduate assistants. In order 
to make sure this choice is not 
removed, graduate assistants 
must give their input to the 
NLRB. The best way to have 
your voice heard is to submit a 
public comment at www.bit.ly/
student_unions, which you can 
do until Dec. 16, 2019. Public 
comments will be taken under 
consideration to inform the ?nal 
decision of the NLRB. If you want 
to be involved more directly in 
our efforts, you can email our VP 
of External Affairs at gsa-vpea@

In the Sept. 29 issue of 
The Tartan, senior Hadrian 
DeMaioribus had expressed 
frustration with what he sees 
as limitations in the recently 
announced expansion of the 
Carnegie Mellon commitment 
to sustainability. DeMaioribus 
observes that the Sept. 23 
announcement did not include 
specific commitments for staff 
hires, monetary investments, 
actionable benchmarks, or 
the creation of an Office of 
Sustainability. We welcome 
the opportunity provided by 
his letter to make a few points 
about what this effort is and is 
not.
The Carnegie Mellon 
Sustainability Initiative aims 
to take our university to the 
next level in sustainability 
education, research, and 
practice, through the 
engagement of our entire 
community. Decentralized 
initiative and action, with 
support from the university 
leadership when needed and 
appropriate, is a long-standing 
characteristic of our campus 
culture. In the Sustainability 
Initiative announcement, 
Provost Garrett committed 
to providing support as 
recommended by a Steering 
Committee and Advisory 
Council comprised of faculty, 
staff, and students that has 
just begun to meet. The 
same Faculty Senate Ad Hoc 
Committee that encouraged 
an expansion of efforts in 
sustainability is supportive of 
the Sustainability Initiative 
as the right path forward 
for Carnegie Mellon and 
endorsed its alignment with 
the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs).
We note also the long history 
of sustainability-related 
achievement and innovation 
at Carnegie Mellon as 
documented by the Association 
for the Advancement of 
Sustainability in Higher 
Education’s Sustainability 
Tracking and Rating System. 
The fully transparent report 
catalogs Carnegie Mellon’s 
achievements that earned 
the Gold level rating: equal 
to or better than our peer 
institutions.
Yet, we can do more to 
take advantage of a once in 
a generation opportunity 
provided by the SDGs that run 
through 2030. This paradigm 
shift in how communities 
around the world address 
sustainability includes, but goes 
beyond, environmental aspects 
and addresses, for example, 
efforts to reduce inequality 
and increase gender equity. 
The Provost’s announcement 
included a commitment to 
conduct a Voluntary University 
Review or VUR, replicating 
how entities around the world 
are measuring progress on 
the SDGs. In this way, we are 
part of a global effort, and 
we will, with the support of 
volunteers across the Carnegie 
Mellon community, compile 
our triumphs and shortfalls 
as they align with the SDG 
frame and publicly report 
the findings next year during 
the UN General Assembly. As 
a first step, we will conduct 
a university-wide survey of 
Knowledge, Attitude and 
Practice to create a baseline 
of how students, staff, and 
faculty relate to the breadth of 
the SDGs, whether passionate 
about green energy, reducing 
food waste, halving violence 
and corruption, or creating 
smart cities.
What this effort is not is 
the work of one person alone 
at Carnegie Mellon. Elevating 
sustainability to the next 
level will require interest, 
engagement, and initiative 
across our community. We 
encourage all students, 
staff, and faculty members 
to get to know the SDGs, get 
involved, and participate in 
the Sustainability Initiative. 
We welcome your ideas at 
sustainability@cmu.edu.
David Dzombak, Steve Guen-
ther, and Sarah Mendelson are

Steering Committee.

Neural activity plays an important role in longevity
SEAN MIN
Staffwriter
While we have long known 
that neural activity in the brain 
is responsible for disorders such 
as dementia and epilepsy, recent 
research conducted by scientists 
in the Blavatnik Institute at 
Harvard Medical School (HMS) 
has shown that it also plays a role 
in human aging and life span.
The study was published in 
Nature on Oct. 16. Researchers 
observed mice, worms, and 
human brains and found that 
a lot of activity in the brain is 
correlated with shorter life spans. 
As such, suppressing brain activity 
extends life spans. This is the ?rst 
piece of evidence that supports 
the hypothesis that nervous 
system activity impacts longevity 
in humans. Past studies have 
demonstrated that portions of 
the nervous system affect animal 
aging, but no prior work has 
shown similar effects in humans.
“An intriguing aspect of our 
?ndings is that something as 
transient as the activity state 
of neural circuits could have 
such far-ranging consequences 
for physiology and life span,” 
said study senior author Bruce 
Yankner, professor of genetics at 
HMS and co-director of the Paul 
F. Glenn Center for the Biology of 
Aging in a HMS press release.
A chain that affects longevity, 
the insulin and insulin-like 
growth factor (IGF) signaling 
pathway, is apparently where 
neural excitation acts. An integral 
portion of this signaling cascade 
is RE1-Silencing Transcription 
(REST), a protein that the 
Yankner Lab has shown prevents 
brains from developing dementia 
and other disorders.
Neural activity is de?ned as 
all of the electrical currents and 
transmissions contained within 
the brain. Neural excitation can 
result in many outcomes such as 
a muscle twitch or a change in 
our mood. As for mood, the study 
has not yet shown if someone’s 
thoughts, personality, or actions 
change their lifespan.
“An exciting future area of 
research will be to determine 
how these ?ndings relate to such 
higher-order human brain func-
tions,” said Yankner.
Yankner and his colleagues 
looked at gene expression 
patterns in donated tissue from 
people who died between the 
ages of 60 and 100. None of these 
adults had dementia. They found 
that those who were alive for more 
than 85 years expressed neural 
excitation genes to a lesser extent 
than those who died between the 
ages of 60 and 80. In order to test 
if these results were due to corre-
lation or causation, the research-
ers conducted many experiments 
on C. elegans, genetically altered 
mice, and more brain tissue.
They found that blocking 
REST, a protein responsible for 
suppressing gene expression and 
neural activity, caused higher 
neural activity and earlier deaths. 
Centenarians’ brains contained 
more REST than those who died 
earlier.
Thanks to this study, the 
development of new therapies 
that can treat conditions 
involving neural excitation such 
as Alzheimer’s disease or bipolar 
disorder is imminent. In addition, 
the scientists have found that 
some forms of medicine like 
drugs that target REST or some 
actions such as meditation 
may be capable of increasing 
lifespan through the modulation 
of neural activity. Since human 
variation in neural activity may 
have both environmental and 
genetic causes, this study has 
opened up future avenues for 
therapeutic intervention.

activity state of neural circuits could 
have such far-ranging consequences

Using leaves to produce clean gas
FRANK HU
Operations Manager
Clean energy is a hot topic in today’s 
scientific community, with researchers 
all over the world dedicating 
herculean amounts of time and effort 
towards finding innovative and 
sustainable solutions to fueling future 
generations. Although the term “clean 
energy” prompts many people to think 
about wind turbines, solar panels, 
and hydroelectric plants, researchers 
at the University of Cambridge, led 
by Professor Erwin Reisner, took a 
unique approach by mimicking the 
photosynthetic machinery of ordinary 
leaves to produce syngas, a widely 
used gas in commercial products that’s 
currently produced from fossil fuels.
Much like ordinary leaves, these 
artificial leaves take in sunlight, car-
bon dioxide, and water, the staples of 
photosynthesis. While one portion of 
the artificial leaf outputs oxygen like 
an ordinary leaf, the other portion fo-
cuses on reducing carbon dioxide and 
water into carbon monoxide and hy-
drogen, forming the syngas mixture. 
As a pleasant surprise, the research-
ers found that their combinations of 
catalysts and sensors also operates 
efficiently under low-light conditions, 
meaning that the artificial leaf 
performs effectively under low-light 
and cloudy conditions, a step above 
ordinary solar panels.
“This means you are not limited 
to using this technology just in warm 
countries, or only operating the 
process during the summer months,” 
said PhD student Virgil Andrei, first 
author of the paper, in a Cambridge 
press release. “You could use it from 
dawn until dusk, anywhere in the 
world.”
While the creation of the artificial 
leaf itself is a breakthrough, Reisner 
and his team are already looking at 
ways to improve the device to start 
generating liquid fuels since syngas 
is a component for the synthesis of 
liquid fuels. What the team hopes to 
accomplish is to produce liquid fuels in 
a one-step process rather than making 
syngas first and then converting the gas 
into fuel. With such an advancement, 
fuel generated from the artificial 
leaves could be used as a sustainable 
and carbon-neutral alternative to 
petrol and fossil fuels.
Whether or not such efforts will 
yield success remains to be seen, but 
the team is confident that their choice 
of components, as well as their current 
results, indicates that they’re moving 
in the right direction. As the global 
demand for liquid fuels continues to 
escalate, the commercial introduction 
of the artificial leaf could help move 
us towards a more sustainable and 
energy-rich future. Changing means 
of energy production is good for the 
environment.
“This means you are not limited to using this 
technology just in warm countries, or only 
operating the process during the summer 
months.”

Prehistoric humans stored bone marrow
ASHWIN SRINIVASAN
SciTech Editor
According to a study from Tel 
Aviv University and researchers 
from Spain, early Paleolithic 
people stored animal bones 
for weeks and then feasted on 
them, according to archeologi-
cal findings in Qesem Cave in 
Israel. The Lower Paleolithic 
time period that occurred 
400,000 years ago has had 
much of its history discovered 
at the cave.
“Bone marrow constitutes a 
significant source of nutrition 
and as such was long featured in 
the prehistoric diet,” explained 
Professor Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv 
University in a press release. 
“Until now, evidence has point-
ed to immediate consumption 
of marrow following the 
procurement and removal of 
soft tissues. In our paper, we 
present evidence of storage and 
delayed consumption of bone 
marrow at Qesem Cave.”
The study reveals how early 
humans adapted and interacted 
with each other to survive. The 
residents of the Qesem Cave 
usually brought some parts of 
animal carcasses, including 
limbs and skulls of fallow deer.
“We found that the deer 
leg bones, specifically the 
metapodials, exhibited unique 
chopping marks on the shafts, 
which are not characteristic of 
the marks left from stripping 
fresh skin to fracture the bone 
and extract the marrow,” said 
Professor Jordi Rosell of Rovira 
i Virgili University in Reus, 
Spain.
The bones were covered 
in skin in order to preserve 
marrow. Indeed, experimen-
tation by the researchers de-
termined that marrow fat was 
only minimally degraded after 
up to nine weeks of storage in 
the cave.
“We discovered that pre-
serving the bone along with 
the skin, for a period that could 
last for many weeks, enabled 
early humans to break the bone 
when necessary and eat the 
still nutritious bone marrow,” 
added Tel Aviv University’s Pro-
fessor Ruth Blasco, lead author 
on the study.
Essentially, the bones were 
vessels for the marrow that was 
so critical in these Paleolithic 
humans’ diets. When the people 
of the Qesem Cave wanted to 
eat, they simply peeled back the 
protective skin and shattered 
the bone. This pattern of food 
storage represents a major 
advancement in hunter-
gatherer behavior and a step 
towards growing human 
intellect.

Shcherbakova, a young figure skater, shocks at senior eventThe World Series: How we got here
CYNTHIA XU
Assistant Sports Editor
2019 Skate America was the 
?rst event in the 2019-20 ISU 
Grand Prix of Figure Skating. 
This was a competition in which 
athletes who performed well could 
earn points towards qualifying 
for the 2019-20 Grand Prix Final. 
Held in Las Vegas, Skate America 
saw seasoned competitors and 
?rst-timers alike vying for podium 
positions.
15-year-old Anna Shcherba-
kova, the Russian champion and 
Junior World silver medalist, was 
competing in her ?rst senior-level 
Grand Prix event. Though she was 
among the youngest athletes in 
the competition, she had won gold 
at her senior debut at the Lombar-
dia Trophy, and expectations ran 
high.
In the short program, 
Shcherbakova performed a dou-
ble Axel, a triple ?ip, and a triple 
Lutz-triple loop combination 
for her jumps. However, under-
rotation on the loop and a 1.00 
point deduction for a fall, along 
with several mistakes on the step 
sequence meant that she received 
a total of 67.60 points. This placed 
her in fourth place, 7.5 points 
behind the leader, Bradie Tennell 
of the USA.
Shcherbakova’s free skate 
started spectacularly, beginning 
with a performance of her most 
dif?cult element: a quadruple 
Lutz-triple toe loop combination 
that seemed to have her levitating 
off the ice effortlessly. Landing 
beautifully, Shcherbakova quickly 
followed that up with a historic 
second quad Lutz that she landed 
just as cleanly. She then went on 
to perform 2 well-executed double 
Axels and a sequence of spins 
ending with a remarkable costume 
change, signaling the start of the 
second half of her routine with an 
accompanying shift in music.
A triple Lutz-triple loop 
combination was Shcherbakova’s 
?rst second-half element. 
Although the Lutz was done 
well, the loop was under-rotated. 
Another combination, a triple 
?ip-Euler-triple Salchow, saw 
points withheld for under-rotation 
on the Salchow as well. Her last 
jump, a triple Lutz with both 
hands overhead, was wonderfully 
executed and given full points. 
Shcherbakova ended her routine 
with another set of spins, a well-
choreographed step sequence, 
and a third set of spins, the sum 
of which brought her technical 
score up to 92.20 — nearly 20 
points higher than the leading 
competitor.
With a program component 
score of 67.96, Shcherbakova 
received a phenomenal ?nal free 
skate score of 160.16 — a score 
almost 10 points over her previous 
personal best and the second-
highest ladies’ free skate score in 
history. She shot up to ?rst place 
with a combined total of 227.76 
points.
Bradie Tennell, who had 
led with a 75.10 personal best 
in the short program, put up a 
formidable performance, but her 
free skate score of 141.04 was 
far below Shcherbakova’s, and 
Tennell’s combined total of 216.14 
saw her take the silver medal.
With her phenomenal 
performance, Shcherbakova 
took the gold medal in incredible 
style, becoming not only the ?rst 
woman in the senior competition 
to land two quadruple Lutzes 
in international competition, 
but also the ?rst lady to land a 
quad Lutz-triple combination 
in international competition. 
She also set new records for the 
highest valued single jump and 
highest valued jump combination, 
having earned 14.79 points for her 
quad Lutz and 18.66 points for her 
quad Lutz-triple toe combination.
Shcherbakova’s history-making 
quadruple Lutzes exempli?es 
the accelerating evolution of the 
sport. Scarcely two decades ago, 
the idea of a woman landing any 
quadruple jump in a competition 
of this scale seemed preposter-
ous. The idea of anyone land-
ing a quad Lutz, in fact, seemed 
incredible just a decade ago. Now 
with Shcherbakova landing two 
quad Lutzes a mere year after her 
countrywoman Alexandra Trusova 
landed the ?rst rati?ed quadruple 
Lutz in competition, it is evident 
that ?gure skating is progressing 
rapidly towards new heights.
It seems that Shcherbakova 
is de?nitely a competitor to 
watch going forward, and if she 
continues to perform as well as 
she did at the ISU’s 2019 Skate 
America, more stunning, record-
setting skates are sure to follow.

Baseball is best played in 
October. The air is cooler, the 
nights are darker, and under the 
bright lights, the play is better. 
So far, the 2019 Major League 
Baseball (MLB) postseason has 
been stellar, a mix of thrilling 
games, shocking upsets, ?ghting 
underdogs, and great lineups and 
rotations working together. As 
the American League champion 
Houston Astros and National 
League champion Washington 
Nationals are embroiled in the 
middle of a tight World Series, 
let’s look back at their paths to the 
Fall Classic.
With the best regular season 
record in baseball, the 107-win 
Astros entered the postseason 
as favorites to take back the 
championship for the second time 
in three years with a killer rotation 
that features Gerrit Cole and 
Justin Verlander, who could both 
take the Cy Young, no questions 
asked. Most of their 2017 lineup 
has remained, with 2017 World 
Series MVP George Springer, 
2017 NL MVP Jose Altuve, Carlos 
Correa, and Alex Bregman, who 
?nished September with MVP-
level stats.
But in the ALDS, the Astros 
had to get through the Tampa 
Bay Rays, who beat the Oakland 
Athletics in the Wild Card game 
and have the lowest payroll in 
baseball. The underdog Rays 
pushed the Astros to ?ves games 
in a best of ?ve series, winning 
two elimination games before 
the Astros put it together to win 
Game 5 and head to the ALCS. 
Against the 103-win Yankees, 
the championship series for the 
AL pennant was a rematch of the 
2017 ALCS, but this time it was 
clear the Astros were slightly 
better, winning in six games that 
featured two walk-offs, including 
Altuve’s series-winning home run.
The Astros met the Nationals 
in the World Series, a team 
that few expected to be in the 
conversation late in October. 
After losing franchise star Bryce 
Harper in free agency and a slow 
start to the season, the Nationals 
had little chance to even make it 
the postseason. But on the back 
of their two aces, Max Scherzer 
and Stephen Strasburg, and 
a high-contact lineup with 
Anthony Rendon and Juan 
Soto, the Nationals have de?ed 
expectations.
They defeated the Milwaukee 
Brewers in a come-from-behind 
win in the Wild Card and then 
pushed the heavy favorite Los 
Angeles Dodgers to ?ve games 
in the NLDS. After two straight 
World Series appearances, a great 
regular season, and a stacked 
roster, the Dodgers were expected 
to cruise their way through the 
series. After trailing most of Game 
5, the Nationals tied it up in the 
eighth, and then Howie Kendrick 
hit a grand slam in the 10th to 
advance the team to the NLCS. 
There, they cruised, sweeping the 
St. Louis Cardinals en route to the 
World Series.
The two teams have quite a few 
similarities. They have two aces, 
with a great third option: Zack 
Greinke for the Astros, who was 
traded mid-season, and Patrick 
Corbin for the Nationals, who 
was signed in free agency in the 
off season. They have stars, like 
Altuve and Soto, a second-year 
player who just turned 21 and has 
burst onto the national stage in 
the last few weeks.
And so they clashed, the road 
team winning in the ?rst four 
games to even up the series at 2–2, 
effectively resetting for a two-of-
three series. Maybe it will go all 
seven games, like the best World 
Series do. Perhaps the Astros will 
assert their dominance like all the 
pundits expected, or the Nation-
als will continue on this great 
run they’ve had. Let’s grab our 
friends, bundle up in our late fall 
jackets, grab a foot-long hot dog, 
and watch the last baseball games 
of the year.

CMU football back on top against Thiel at Homecoming
CHINASA MBANUGO
Staffwriter
On Homecoming Saturday, 
clouds rolled into the sky as 
the Carnegie Mellon University 
football team faced off against 
the Thiel College Tomcats. In the 
?rst quarter, sophomore Brandon 
Nguyen opened the scoring with 
a 31-yard ?eld goal making the 
game 3-0. With 13 minutes left 
in the ?rst half, the Tartans had 
pushed the score to 17-0 with two 
touchdowns on short runs after 
long drives.
The ?rst came from a two-yard 
run from senior Chris Haas and 
the second came from a one-yard 
keeper by junior quarterback JD 
Dayhuff. By the end of the ?rst 
half, the score was 30-0 thanks to 
a connection between Dayhuff and 
junior Alec Oshita on a 25-yard 
strike that pushed the score to 
23-0. The duo linked up again for 
another 25-yard touchdown pass, 
leaving the scoreboard at 30-0 
before the half. The game was 
assuredly in the Tartan’s hands.
Less than a minute into the 
third quarter, junior Luke Bikulege 
ran for a four-yard touchdown to 
push the score to 37-0, and with 
just four minutes left in the third 
quarter, junior placekicker Zack 
Shirk made the score 40-0 with 
his ?rst career ?eld goal. Thiel’s 
?rst run-in with the scoreboard 
came in the fourth quarter with a 
10-yard touchdown pass to make 
the score 40-7. This victory made 
the Tartans 6-2 overall and the 
Tomcats 0-8 overall. The Tartans 
ended the game with the same 
electricity it began; the Tartans 
never slowed down and shut out 
the Tomcats for the majority of the 
game.
Defensively, the Tartan 
secondary held Thiel to 182 yards 
of total offense. This is the third 
time this season that the Tartan 
defense has held the opposing 
team to less than 200 yards for an 
average of 273.9 yards allowed per 
game, but the defense is averaging 
only 12 points allowed per game. 
Senior Michael Lohmeier led 
the way in number of defensive 
tackles, ?nishing with ten. The 
Tartans defense held off the Tom-
cats offense to two straight three-
and-outs, giving the Tartans of-
fense the opportunity to take 
advantage of each of their pos-
sessions and widen the score gap 
between the two teams.
Offensively, Dayhuff threw for 
225 yards, and Oshita was the top 
receiver for Dayhuff, garnering 88 
yards through the air. Junior Sean 
Cooke led the rushing attack with 
44 yards.
In the end, the Tartans made 
this a memorable Homecoming by 
effectively boxing out the Tomcats 
for most of the game, capitalizing 
off of all of their possessions, 
and never losing energy and 
excitement throughout the game. 
The Tartans have a break next 
week, but will play host to the 
Titans of Westminster College.
On Homecoming weekend, the Tartans handily took down the Thiel Tomcats by putting up 40 unanswered points. Thiel only scored one touchdown.

The Steelers deal with a slow start, plagued by injury woesPenalty shouts: a soccer star is born
MATTHEW BENUSA
Sports Editor
This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention. 
There is a new soccer God, 
and his name is Christian Pulisic. 
Has Messi ever scored a hat trick 
against Burnley? Has Pulisic ever 
evaded his taxes? Has Ronaldo 
ever been cool? No. No. And no.
As someone who has played, in 
my own Pennsylvania childhood, 
against a team that Pulisic 
would have scrimmaged against 
regularly in his time on the PA 
Classics Academy team, I have the 
de?nitive facts that prove Pulisic 
is, like, really good at soccer. And 
those facts will prove that I am 
simply a fallen God of the soccer 
world, my talents instead wasted 
on dumb teenagers that I played 
pickup against last week. Or at 
least I think they were teenagers. 
They could have been toddlers. 
Basically the same thing. I digress.
When I was a young buck, 
my soccer skills were quite 
unmatched. I was a goalie for my 
team, diving this way and that 
to prevent the other team from 
scoring. In one game, I only let 
in eight goals. My worst moment 
was only a single occurrence — 
better than most — and it was 
only because I had to go to the 
bathroom. So I faked an injury. 
But that only says my on-?eld 
prowess was unmatched by 
everyone we ever played.
Now the day I played against 
the team Pulisic would have 
played against in practice, I was 
really on my game. At one point, 
I made a scorpion kick save. This 
one kid was really good, however, 
likely a nice matchup against 
Pulisic in any number of practice 
drills and games. During the 
game, he got a few shots on net 
early in the game, but my goalie 
fu left him scoreless. Although my 
best save of the game came in the 
last few minutes. This top player 
was on a breakaway. He ran at 
me with ferocity. He made it all 
the way to me. He wound up for 
a shot. I punched him in the face. 
He didn’t score!
After that, I went off the ?eld 
because the dumb referee called it 
a “foul,” but I didn’t see any dirty 
play. The kid kinda deserved it. 
And I even apologized once his 
nose stopped bleeding, but the 
referee didn’t see eye to eye with 
me. Anyway, we lost the game 
16–1.
It’s safe to say that I took that 
kid to task, and since he (likely) 
played against Christian Pulisic 
in practice, I am almost as good 
as our new American soccer God. 
Whenever I start playing again, 
I’ll surely be offered a spot at 
Tottenham, at least. That’s when 
I’ll show the world my true skills.
Until then, Godspeed Pulisic. 
May America have mercy on your 
soul, and may you score another 
hat-trick in the BPL.

Last season, the Steelers just 
wanted to get to 2019. Running 
back Le’Veon Bell started the 
Steelers’ season with drama by 
holding out for a bigger contract, 
and when he did not receive it, 
he didn’t return to the team. This 
contributed to a losing streak 
that saw the Steelers go from 
a 7-2-1 start to ?nish at 9-6-1. 
Their record wasn’t good enough 
to make the playoffs. To make 
matters worse, superstar wide 
receiver Antonio Brown had 
vocal, public disagreements with 
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, 
and eventually requested a trade 
to leave the Steelers.
A year later, the Steelers are 
free of the Brown and Bell drama, 
and it seemed they would not 
miss them much with their new 
star running back, James Conner, 
and a wide receiver core that still 
includes Pro Bowler Juju Smith-
Schuster. The expectations were 
not high after a tough campaign 
in 2018, but the Steelers wanted to 
bounce back.
Six games in, the team is far 
from any playoff chance. After six 
games, they’re well under .500 at 
2-4.
The season started with a 33-3 
shellacking at the hands of the 
New England Patriots. However, 
the Steelers can’t carry too much 
blame for the loss. New England 
has continued on to a 7-0 record, 
and they have one of the best 
defenses in the NFL with 18 
interceptions and an average of 
4.0 yards allowed per play. Still, 
it was a troubling sign that the 
Steelers could not keep up with 
good competition.
The next game against the 
Seattle Seahawks was much more 
competitive, and the Steelers 
looked to build some momentum. 
However, Roethlisberger went 
down with an elbow injury, and 
the Steelers could not get the win 
with backup quarterback Mason 
Rudolph. Rudolph performed 
passably, but the Steelers lost 
28-26. To make matters worse, 
Roethlisberger was ruled out for 
the season.
Roethlisberger’s injury dealt 
a crushing blow to the Steelers. 
Rudolph performed well with a 67 
percent completion rate and seven 
touchdowns to two interceptions, 
but he struggled in a Steelers loss 
against the San Francisco 49ers. 
Also, the injury bug struck the 
Steelers again when Rudolph 
left a game against the Baltimore 
Ravens with a concussion, and the 
team had to turn to third-string 
quarterback Devlin Hodges. Now, 
the Steelers are just 2-4 with their 
only victories against the winless 
Cincinnati Bengals and the 
struggling Los Angeles Chargers.
Now, the Steelers are hoping to 
recover from injuries and subpar 
play to make a playoff push before 
it is too late. This week, Rudolph 
and others like linebacker T.J. 
Watt will return from injury, and 
they hope to ease into things with 
a game on Monday against the 
0-6 Miami Dolphins. At the least, 
the team’s goal will certainly be 
to improve their play. Rudolph 
has performed serviceably, but his 
season high in attempts is 28 in 
today’s pass happy NFL. This has 
put pressure on the running game, 
and it has sputtered with 3.5 
yards per attempt despite having 
Conner, their star hopeful running 
back.
We won’t know if the Steelers 
are back on the right track until 
they play better competition, but a 
win against the Dolphins would be 
a good start. If they want to turn 
their season around and return to 
the playoffs, they will have to start 
their push on Monday. They face 
off against the Dolphins at home 
at 7:30 p.m.
Ben Roethlisberger went down in the second game of the season with an elbow injury and has yet to return.

The Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens has man-
aged to reinvent itself from a beautiful area dedicated to the
cultivation and preservation of a wide array of plants to 
a space that could be enjoyed and celebrated by children 
of all ages. Many of their different gardens have become 
places for children to play. In one room, a children’s train 
set was inserted into the shrubbery and the tracks were laid 
into the soil. Small lifelike figures of people stood between 
the leaves, tiny windmills spun in the breeze, and houses and 
farms decorated the spaces uninhabited by plants.
Upon entrance to the Conservatory, a staff member points 
out the path of the activities. First, though, goodie bags filled 
with candies and small games are offered. In a winding way, 
the participant, child or adult, floats from room to room in a
sparkling wonder. Surprisingly, the only thing out of place 
was the wedding rehearsal happening in a large space in 
the southwest corner of the gardens, seeming to remind all 
of the adults and even some of the children that the
experience that they were having in the conservatory was 
a once a year event and that they should enjoy it while it 
lasted.
On the other side of the wedding rehearsal, a game 
was well underway with a dozen children lining 
up to try and toss a ring onto a witch’s hat on the 
ground. Magnificent as the rehearsal was, it was 
clear that the event would not squelch the capacity 
for fun on the evening. Children’s enjoyment was 
to be had in every room possible at every possible 
second, even during a wedding rehearsal, mak-
ing the evening magical for the children that were 
there.
Outside, across a small, beautiful bridge, and back 
inside again, the line for face painting stretched 
on and on. Peering to see the work of the artist, 
one could find the faces of children masquerading 
as unicorns, green goblins, butterflies, and fairies. 
Walking past the line, the room with multiple train 
sets was the next spectacle. Children bent around 
the tracks trying to peer inside of the tiny, moving 
trains. Some even ran alongside the train, too
impatient to wait to see it a mere minute later when 
it came back.
The last spectacle to complete the circle was a pot 
your own plant station. Somehow we had gone 
from goodie bags to ring tosses to unicorns to trains 
and back to plants, the main attraction of the
gardens. Perhaps the last station was a reminder 
that families could take home with them a reminder 
of what the gardens had promised these children 
for one night only: magic, in whatever form they 
could find it.
Halloween Happenings

---------------------------------------------------

Everyone dreams of being the hero of their 
own story, and Frank Abagnale Jr. is no 
exception. Like many, he dreamed of a 
fascinating life, but lived his life like no other.
Based on the autobiography and the 2002 
film of the same name, Catch Me If You Can 
recounts the tale of former criminal Frank 
William Abagnale Jr. and his teenage heists: 
impersonating a pilot, doctor, and lawyer 
all while making a fortune. Scotch’n’Soda’s 
production certainly makes its mark bringing 
Catch Me If You Can to the stage, serving this 
musical with a rather bitter introduction and a 
sweet aftertaste, all with its twists and rocks.
Frank Abagnale Jr. (Clayton Edwards), is first 
introduced to the audience as a 16-year old, 
caught in the middle of his parents’ infidelity 
and subsequent divorce. The character himself 
is an acquired taste for the audience. Almost 
like a Sour Patch-Kid, Frank comes off as a 
little sour at first, almost unlikable, whiny, 
and stubborn. Even when he’s impersonating 
a pilot, Frank seems a bit too outwardly 
naive: in real life, Frank’s apparent lack of 
confidence while pulling off his stunt as a pilot 
would probably get him caught right away. It 
wasn’t until his first attempt to charm his way 
out of being arrested that the audience finally 
got a glimpse of the hidden genius behind 
Frank Abagnale Jr. The sweet charisma, 
chutzpah, and brilliance that gave Frank 
the ability to scheme his way was finally 
revealed. For me, that was the turn-around 
point when I started laughing with him instead 
of at him.
From then on, until the 11 o’clock number 
“Goodbye,” I found myself rooting for 
Frank despite the gravity of his crimes. The 
emerging maturity of the character and his 
emotional development contributed to a far 
more enjoyable presence throughout the 
second act, as well as during the finale.
Carl Hanratty (Quincy Eaton), the seemingly

antagonistic FBI agent bent on catching 
Frank, was the metaphorical Cadbury Cream 
Egg: tough on the outside while emotional 
on the inside. Slightly more comic than 
truly intimidating, Hanratty’s supposedly 
hidden ‘flamboyance’ added to the giggles 
scattered throughout the audience. His 
signature number complemented by Eaton’s 
superb dancing skills (appropriately titled 
“Don’t Break the Rules”) was certainly one 
to remember. Honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever 
get the image of Hanratty channeling his 
inner Fred Astaire out of my head any time 
soon. In short though, his character is quite 
stagnant throughout the show, almost absent 
of development, but nevertheless manages to 
leave a pleasant impression.
Though Catch Me If You Can is a story of 
Frank’s escapades and Hanratty’s chase, the 
supporting characters certainly make their 
mark long after the show. Some notable 
figures include Brenda Strong (Zoe Lehn), 
the eventual love interest of Frank, who 
successfully subverts the all-too-familiar Mary 
Sue trope while playing the grounded foil 
to Frank’s chaos. Lehn’s strong (no pun 
intended) vocal range and acting abilities 
made her character likable and turned her 
performance of “Fly, Fly Away” from a simple 
ballad to a vocal, tear-jerking showpiece. 
Meanwhile, the FBI agents Branton, Cod, 
and Dollar (Grant Martin, Olivia Snavely, 
and Nathan Blinn, respectively) provided 
the largest source of comic relief throughout 
the show. Starting off as barely laughable 
through their mutual ‘hazing’ antics, they 
‘bring the big guns’ (still no pun intended) 
through the second half delivering laugh-
out-loud, slapstick-like comedy gold as they 
accompany Hanratty on his crime-fighting 
quest.
While I highly appreciate the efforts made 
by the lighting crew to use a colorful variety 
to represent various physical and emotional 
turning points in the plot, I personally found 
Scotch’n’Soda: Catch Me If You Can
the set itself to be rather empty. For a musical 
(and a protagonist) that seeks a “life in 
living color,” “la dolce vita,” and “butter 
‘outta cream,” I was expecting a bit more 
embellishment. The minimalist set, while not 
unfamiliar, seemed unsuitable for Catch Me If 
You Can, given its plot about Frank living the 
stylish, glamorous, and fast-paced life.
As highly anticipated as they were, the 
musical numbers certainly did not disappoint. 
The orchestra, despite the surprisingly 
small size, delivered a powerful sound that 
carried energy and musicality. (However, 
the proximity of the not-really-in-the-pit 
orchestra made the actors slightly difficult 
to hear throughout the show.) My personal 
favorite, “Life in Living Color”, literally set 
the stage in the best energetic and colorful 
way possible. “Butter ‘Outta Cream” and 
“Little Boy Be a Man” served as jazzy songs 
describing the two contrasting types of father-
son relationships. The former, performed by 
Frank and his father, and reprised with Frank 
and Hanratty, hints at a friendly relationship, 
almost confidant-like, and serves as an 
homage to the American dream. Meanwhile, 
the latter describes an authoritarian style of 
parenting, as well as a source of bonding 
(and good chemistry) between Hanratty and 
Frank’s father. And I’m sure that I will hear 
the romantic and sweet “Seven Wonders” at 
weddings, anniversaries, and proposals for 
years to come. Last but not least, “Goodbye” 
had me in awe of Edwards’ tenor and acting 
ability as he portrayed a changed, slightly 
saccharine, Frank Abagnale Jr., ready to 
leave a life of crime. It was truly the best 
farewell I have ever heard.
All in all, a job well done by Scotch’n’Soda 
Theatre for delivering a feel-good 
performance with memorable numbers and 
characters.
Now excuse me as I make “Life in Living 
Color” my phone alarm.

TALL         GIRL

---------------------------------------------------

If you’re looking for a fun night in with a so-bad-it’s-
kinda-good (but not really) movie, look no further 
than one of Netflix’s newest releases, Tall Girl. Take 
a rom-com plot, notably along the lines of the John 
Hughes classic Pretty in Pink, and make it modern and 
cinematically worse. Honestly, I’m doing a disservice 
to Hughes by comparing this movie to anything in his 
filmography, but the plots are way too similar: outcast 
girl falls for attractive, popular guy and makes a fool 
out of herself after her best friend who secretly (Pretty 
in Pink), or not-so-secretly (Tall Girl), has a crush on her 
and unsuccessfully dissuades her from attempting to get 
the guy. The outcomes are different, but the main plot is 
essentially the same. Hughes just, as expected, does it 
way better.
In Tall Girl, Jodi is tormented by her classmates at 
her high school for being 6’1”, but the support of 
her friends, Fareeda and Dunkleman, has gotten her 
through it while she keeps her head down and tries not 
to draw attention to herself. I don’t know about other 
people’s high schools, but it just seemed petty and unre-
alistic for people to be that obnoxious to her for some-
thing so silly. Also, it statistically seemed strange how 
not a single human was taller than Jodi in the whole 
school? But okay, sure. Whatever.
Despite having two incredible friends, she longs to be 
a girl that guys want to date. Dunkleman constantly 
expresses his interest in her, and yet she can’t see past 
the fact that he is considerably shorter than her and 
continues to not take him seriously. He tells her that her 
expectations are too high for a perfect boyfriend, yet 
she still daydreams about it. As luck (or cringe-worthy 
screenwriting) would have it, the new, tall Swedish 
exchange student, Stig, just happens to waltz into chem-
istry class during this discussion and instantly make all 
the girls swoon for him, including Jodi. To make the 
love triangle even more dramatic, Stig is living with 
Dunkleman while he’s in the States. Actually, it’s a love 
square: Kimmy, the most popular girl in school (who 
happens to be Jodi’s worst tormenter), immediately digs 
her manicured claws into Stig and claims him as hers. 
All I have to say is yikes.
Tension rises as Jodi stumbles across Stig playing the 
piano, joins him in a duet (with singing from Guys and 
Dolls and everything), and is caught by Kimmy, who 
warns Jodi to stay away from Stig when he’s not
listening. Of course, Stig is a friendly guy who is
oblivious and still tries to hang out with Jodi, and more 
havoc ensues throughout the rest of the movie, resulting 
in Jodi losing her friends and lots of other drama.
Everything in this movie was absolutely ridiculous, which 
made it fun to watch with friends and laugh about how 
awkward and uncomfortable it was. However, it was 
not remotely a well-made movie. The character
development was nonexistent, their motivations made 
no sense, their decisions seemed impromptu and out-of-
character based on the little knowledge of each person 
we did have, and there was barely any natural plot 
progression. It seemed very forced.
Also, Jodi was just not the most likable character. 
Maybe it’s because everyone else’s expectations of her 
were so unrealistic, but she continuously made question-
able and irresponsible choices and couldn’t handle it 
when she had to face the repercussions. She wasn’t 
evil, but she definitely was inconsiderate of those who 
genuinely cared about her. Considering all the
horrible things she had to deal with socially, she 
seemed rather gullible and susceptible to being swayed 
by the popular crowd after her sister and mom gave 
her a makeover, which in reality seemed to be a simple 
swap from sweatpants to jeans and the ditching of her 
daily ponytail.
The only positives throughout the whole movie were 
her best friends and her family. There were definitely 
rough patches in Jodi’s relationship with Dunkleman 
and Fareeda, but Dunkleman’s devotion to Jodi and 
Fareeda’s willingness to fight anyone to keep Jodi safe 
was really sweet. Although her family could be really 
awkward and often did all the wrong things to make 
her feel better, they genuinely cared about Jodi’s well-
being. Her sister was a bit strange since she was a 
pageant queen (to act as a contrast to Jodi’s supposed 
awkwardness), but she was a genuinely nice person 
who tried to help her sister out in her time of need, and 
the moments Jodi shares with her dad were some of 
the most heartwarming and believable moments in the 
whole movie.
In the end, I wasn’t disappointed by Tall Girl, but I also 
didn’t come in with high expectations. It was probably 
as good and as bad as I could have expected. It’s 
worth a watch just to make fun of it.

It feels like my past several Pillbox 
articles have been concert reviews. 
In these past few weeks, I’ve been 
to more concerts than I have been in 
my entire life combined, but I’m not 
complaining! Last Thursday, Oct. 17, 
Hoodie Allen performed at Foxtail as part 
of his Whatever USA tour. After being 
a longtime fan, and being unable to go 
to his two previous shows, I finally got 
to see him. I guess third time really is a 
charm!
I’m not new to smaller venues, but 
this bar set was a first. The bar was 
absolutely packed with other fangirls 
chanting along to every word to every 
song, as well as to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” 
during the intermission. It might seem 
a bit “basic,” but what fun is life if you 
don’t let yourself enjoy things?
Rapper Jake Miller opened. Sometimes 
opening acts don’t get the hype that they 
deserve, but that was not the case with 
Jake’s performance. I’m personally not 
too familiar with his music and arrived 
halfway through his set, but I could still 
feel the high momentum and energy

that matched that during Hoodie’s 
performance.
Hoodie kicked off the show with the title 
track of his latest release, Whatever USA. 
I was partially expecting his tour to focus 
on his newer tracks, but he had a nice 
mix of older and newer tracks. He went 
back to Crew Cuts with OG favorites like 
“Two Lips” and “Cake Boy,” letting me 
live my best junior high life (back in the 
day when I listened to those on my iPod). 
Tracks from People Keep Talking and 
Happy Camper threw me back and made 
me almost believe that my high school 
years were my glory years (thankfully, 
they were not). The Hype, and now 
Whatever USA, captured the brighter 
parts of my college experience.
Should I have outgrown boyish music 
idols by now? Maybe. Perhaps one 
day I will. But for now, I enjoyed the 
performance. In the words of Hoodie 
himself, “I wanna stay young; don’t 
wanna fit in, I wanna have fun; so if 
that’s okay, I don’t think I’m ever gonna 
act my age.”

---------------------------------------------------

The Lighthouse is not a “strange” 
movie (David Sims, The Atlantic) 
nor is it “savage” and “beyond 
belief” (Anthony Lane, The New 
Yorker), and really, it’s not even 
that horrifying. The Lighthouse is, 
however, a kind of Romantic sea-tale 
set somewhere among the literary 
tradition of Austen, Coleridge, and 
Melville, while taking contemporary 
cues from the likes of The Evil Dead 
and the genre of horror. But from 
the outset, you are not placed into 
the traditional horror. This world is 
different, more visceral and more 
realistic.
In the opening moments of Ephraim 
Winslow (Robert Pattinson) and 
Thomas Wake’s (Willem Dafoe) time 
on the island, they stare straight 
out at the camera as if aware they 
are being photographed. Yet, we 
get each of their most intimate 
moments. Both Winslow and Wake 
have moments of unbridled sexuality 
depicted on screen, from images 
of sexual fantasies and not-so-
dreamlike moments of masturbation 
to subtle spoken moments of 
homoeroticism that turn into 
aggressive displays of masculinity.

Always being watched, like Winslow 
and Wake are, creates an anxiety 
around some of their more intimate 
moments, but sometimes, you really 
don’t care who sees what. People 
do some really disgusting things on 
camera after all, like masturbate to a 
mermaid figurine.
Before continuing with Winslow and 
Wake, it would probably help to 
explain why this movie isn’t horror, 
even though the generic conventions 
are present. There’s a pervasive 
sound of a bullhorn from beginning 
to end, but rather than the normal 
anxiety-inducing sound effect, it’s just 
an annoyance. It’s not exactly striking 
fear into anybody’s hearts. There’s 
the fog, the desolation, and isolated 
setting where they are trapped by 
a storm of epic proportions that 
sets up Winslow for a psychotic, 
murderous rage, but none of those 
things make for a particularly 
psychotic or murderous rage. It’s the 
dull, mundane rage built up by a 
moralizing and importunate superior 
that drives Winslow crazy, and that is 
where the story is made.
Winslow, our representative of our 
the lighthouse
fallen world, is driven insane by his 
bewhiskered superior with an injured 
leg and tendency to sound like 
Captain Ahab, and the comparison 
is driven home by Wake’s fanatic 
protection of the idyllic world, the 
light at the top of the eponymous 
lighthouse. It becomes so obvious, 
Winslow has no choice but to call 
out Wake by saying he’s tired of 
Wake’s Ahab shtick, labeling him a 
“goddamn parody.” Some reviews 
have called The Lighthouse a two-
hander (two main characters), but 
Winslow is the hero of the story, 
as he is given the Promethean task 
of defeating Wake, ascending the 
lighthouse, reaching into the light, 
and returning to the fallen world 
alive. But those tasks are only 
one conflict of Winslow’s in the 
movie. The other conflict revolves 
around Winslow’s sanity, and his 
fight against the darker forces of 
humanity.
As the movie progresses, Winslow’s 
sanity is questioned more and more 
as he faces a descent into the dark 
parts of humanity. Ultimately, the 
conflict between Winslow and the 
dark supernatural forces of the movie 
10

---------------------------------------------------

are comparable to “The Rime of the 
Ancient Mariner,” but instead of an 
albatross shot down from the sky 
to change the winds of fortune, The 
Lighthouse uses a seagull that, for 
the first half of the movie, provides 
a comically stubborn antagonist. The 
scene where Winslow ends the bird’s 
life is not particularly gory or gross 
or terrifying, but the winds change, 
the storm blows in, and the two 
men are forced into conflict. Before 
the murder of the seagull, there is 
a chance for Winslow to escape the 
island. Winslow must descend into 
Hades and face the dark forces within 
his psyche to actualize his ascent to 
the top of the lighthouse, destroying 
the fervent and evangelical protector 
of the light on the way.
Beside all of that, The Lighthouse 
is a two-hour romp of a story, with 
righteous comedic timing, sublime 
performances from Pattinson and 
Dafoe, and aesthetically enjoyable 
photography with appropriate 
referentiality to painting and 
photography of the era. Go see it. 
It’s cool and fun and shows up every 
A24 movie about dumb things like 
family.

---------------------------------------------------

This was one of the iconic lines of the 
2001 romantic drama film, Moulin 
Rouge! — a film recently adapted into 
a stage musical, currently playing in 
Broadway’s Al Hirschfeld Theatre.
Recently, I spent a weekend in New 
York City, and had the privilege of 
seeing Moulin Rouge! The Musical, 
and it was an experience to 
remember.
Upon entering the theatre, I was 
caught off guard by the sheer bold 
grandeur of the set. The entire house 
was bathed in red light. The stage 
itself was lined with cabaret lights, 
and the words “Moulin Rouge” hung 
in the middle of the stage in giant 
neon letters. The elephant stood 
above stage right, and the windmill 
spun slowly above stage left. In the 
center, the stage extended out to a 
can-can table, with two alcoves cut 
out for exclusive seating.
The Al Hirschfeld Theatre is a 
relatively small, intimate theatre, 
and standing in spot 13, I could see 
nearly everything — the overhang of 
the mezzanine just barely blocking 
the windmill and part of the elephant. 
A shift in lighting signaled the start of 
the show, and for the next 2.5 hours, 
the audience was plunged into a tale 
of artful desire and fateful fortune.
Throughout this experience, actors 
used the aisles liberally, frequently 
entering and exiting from the leftmost 
and rightmost aisles, so that standing 
where I was, the actors that passed 
were often less than five feet away, 
something which made the experience 
feel closer and more immersive.
Aaron Tveit and Karen Olivo did a 
phenomenal job of bringing their 
characters to life. Tveit perfectly 
balanced Christian’s optimistic 
charisma and stubborn confidence 
in happy endings, walking the line 
between naive love and passionate 
madness. Olivo splendidly portrayed 
Satine’s persevering, but weathered 
protectiveness and resigned, but 
enduring strength, exuding that sense 
“The greatest thing you’ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.”
12

---------------------------------------------------

of sybaritic mystique and sensitive 
confidence.
The entire company did well to bring 
out the dynamic interplay between 
personalities and classes, emphasizing 
the larger-than-life feeling the show 
inhabits.
Staying true to its status as a jukebox 
musical, Moulin Rouge! retains 
some of the songs used in the film 
soundtrack from artists such as 
Madonna, Nat King Cole, and Elton 
John, while expanding its listing — 
more than doubling it, in fact — to 
include music from the likes of REO 
Speedwagon and the Rolling Stones, 
alongside contemporary pop icons 
such as Katy Perry, Adele, and 
Beyoncé.
The integration of songs from different 
genres and eras was considerably 
well-done, and the choice of music 
often played into the fun, comedic 
enthusiasm of the show. The energy 
from the music did seem to be slightly 
excessive at times, especially during 
the more serious scenes, in that the 
tempo of the music was sometimes 
distinct from the graveness it was 
meant to portray. However, the 
exaggeration still worked in the 
context of the overall superfluousness 
the play itself intends to embody. 
Overall, the song choices and their 
incorporation into the musical could 
certainly be considered unorthodox, 
but in a way that I feel exhibits 
creativity and artistic wit.
On the more technical side of things, 
the show’s lighting and costume 
design were both extremely well-
done. The mix between the cabaret-
style lights, strobe lights, neon 
lights, and LEDs implemented by 
lighting designer Justin Townsend was 
instrumental in moving the story. The 
distinction between the bold vivid 
palette used for the Moulin Rouge 
performers versus the muted colors of 
the Bohemian artists and the pastel 
of the aristocracy, all courtesy of 
costume designer Catherine Zuber, 
emphasized the lifestyle and symbolic 
differences in the characters.
At its core, Moulin Rouge! was 
the epitome of spectacle. It 
intentionally played into the 
absurdity of extravagance, and did 
so in spectacular style. The contrast 
between the outward lavish brilliance 
of the show and the underlying 
tragedy it narrates made it all the 
more compelling, and the blend 
of ecstasy and despair along with 
fervent infatuation and desperate 
belief made it a truly remarkable 
masterpiece.

article by Sujay Utkarsh | Pillbox Editor“Wokeness” is not 
always socially conscious
“Wokeness” is dumb.
Now before I get attacked for that, hear me out really quickly. I am not referring to actually being socially conscious. I don’t think anyone 
thinks that being more socially conscious is bad, unless you’re a self-proclaimed “anti-SJW” like Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson. When I say 
“woke,” I refer to companies who try to be socially conscious for the sake of trendiness and being hip. It’s become a term drenched in irony, 
more often than not used as a joke or a criticism because of how much of a parody it has become.
There is a lot that can be said about “woke culture” in particular, but I’m going to specifically focus on pop culture. I think “wokeness” in our 
pop culture has been ruined by “cultural analysts” in the media who like to write filler, and corporations exploiting it for profit.
Part 1: The Media
For the first point, let’s look at the Joker controversy, which has been done to death, but represents everything wrong with how the media 
tries to be “woke.” For “cultural analysts” in the media, the “woke” goal was to be ahead of the curve. If you spoke out about the movie 
being dangerous before seeing it, reviewed the movie and happened to like it, and then the shooting happened, at least you can point to 
the first thing you said and be like “see, I was right all along and I’m really woke.”
Here are the problems with this whole ordeal. First, movies don’t cause violence. They haven’t ever been correlated. Second, the hysteria 
caused by this will only increase the likelihood of a shooting, not the opposite. Many “cultural analysts” thought the new Joker movie would 
inspire another shooter akin to the one in Aurora, CO from 2012, who claimed he was inspired by the Joker. Except he wasn’t. That was a 
rumor that got erroneously circulated. A simple Google search could have cleared that, but that didn’t stop these “cultural analysts” from 
going ballistic.
The movie was also called an incel movie repeatedly, which none of the trailers indicated. The movie itself didn’t turn out to be one. If 
anything, the main point many of these “analysts” jumped to is that a story about a white guy going insane is an incel movie, which isn’t 
“woke” at all. It’s just wrong and they seem to completely not know what “being an incel” means. What even is an incel movie? Incels will 
view any awful, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, and/or violent white character in any piece of media as a hero, especially when 
that piece of media portrays said character in a negative light. That’s what incels do. It’s the same way racists liked Borat and homophobes 
liked Brüno without getting the fact that they were being made fun of. Don’t give incels the negative attention they crave with this unwar-
ranted “woke” crusade.
If you really wanted an actual cultural critique of the movie, talk about how the movie correlates mental illness with violence. That discussion 
has been severely overlooked, and the film’s lack of nuance regarding that subject was grating. A film creating empathy for the main char-
acter who is an awful person doesn’t mean you’re glorifying that character. Saying that it does for the sake of being “woke” is dishonesty 
and bad criticism, especially when you’re cherry-picking which movies to have that point applied to.
14

---------------------------------------------------

Stop bandwagoning, stop trying to be hip, and 
inform yourself. It doesn’t take very long to do, 
and we’re all better off for it.
Part 2: Corporations
No one should be surprised by corporations ruining “wokeness.” Let’s look at Disney, a company I would love to see get dismantled 
piece by piece. We all know their remakes are bad, but the more I thought about it, the more I was bothered by the way they try to be 
“woke.”
After torrenting the remake, I rewatched the original Dumbo, and I swear to god there is a scene with a pack of crows led by a crow 
named Jim Crow who sounds like a caricature of a black person that a racist white person would imitate. The remake doesn’t even 
acknowledge that, cutting out the crow characters entirely. Now that doesn’t seem bad until you realize they have an entire anti-animal 
cruelty message running throughout the whole movie to “correct” the mistake of the original. In the original, Dumbo gets drunk and 
hallucinates, but in the remake they “correct” that by keeping the alcohol away from the baby elephant when someone offers it.
This is a microcosm of what’s wrong with these movie studios trying to be “woke”: it’s “woke” for the sake of profit. It seems obvious, 
but it’s really insidious and people eat it up. Animal cruelty and women’s empowerment are things that can be marketed. But Disney’s 
racist history? That’s not marketable. Just erase it entirely and pretend it doesn’t exist. It works. Aladdin and The Lion King made tons 
of money. Both featured scenes of all the female characters being “extra empowered,” such as Jasmine getting an extra song talking 
about how she won’t be silenced in Aladdin (which wasn’t a problem in the original anyway) and with Nala getting a fight scene in 
The Lion King because Disney really wants to show how strong she is. But neither addresses the racist material in both movies, and both 
movies diminish the female characters by making them one-dimensional in the remakes.
The industry just seems to be content with ignoring its racist history, and will claim it’s solved racism, sexism, and all the other -isms by 
marketing how it’s becoming more “representative.” Writing one-dimensional female characters who are physically strong is totally 
good representation. Who cares about writing good female characters? Doesn’t matter. The industry says they respect women, even 
though they pay them less on average and are hesitant to hire female directors and writers. Recasting previously white characters as 
different races is such good representation. Who cares about writing good characters for non-white actors to play? Doesn’t matter. So 
many “woke” people will eat up this garbage, pandering nonsense from the industry, but it’s just corporate robots selling them a PR 
vision.
Ok so you criticized everything. What’s the point?
At this point, I just find people claiming “wokeness” to be disingenuous. This isn’t me acting all high and mighty, nor am I calling people 
bad for being disingenuous. Their intentions are in the right place. But I haven’t heard a single socially conscious person refer to them-
selves as “woke” without being ironic. I think many people can do better to be more conscious, and it’s not hard to do better.
