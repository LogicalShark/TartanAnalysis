Student passion unveiled at TEDxCMU CMU redevelops semester in D.C.
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Assistant News Editor
TEDxCMU, a conference 
devoted to bringing together 
innovative thinkers, brought 
11 speakers — including two 
Carnegie Mellon students 
— to the University Center’s 
McConomy Auditorium on 
Sunday to give short talks 
that covered a wide array of 
topics, ranging from urban 
revitalization to delivering 
happiness in students’ daily 
lives.
Ketaki Desai, a third-year 
graduate student in public 
policy and management and 
presdient of TEDxCMU, de-
scribed the idea behind TED 
talks. “TED is basically a con-
ference that was started by 
journalist Chris Anderson, 
and the idea was that people 
should be able to describe 
what they’re doing in 15 to 
18 minutes or even less. The 
idea was to inspire people 
with things that everybody 
was doing, because there was 
no way to know what people 
were working on,” Desai said.
The theme of TEDxCMU 
this year was “Spark”; the 
event’s goal was “to spark col-
laboration and foster connec-
tions between participants, 
encouraging aspiring indi-
viduals to follow their dreams 
and make a difference.”
Zo?a Tillman, a ?rst-
year chemical engineering 
and biomedical engineering 
double major and volunteer 
at TEDxCMU, said that the 
theme of “Spark” refers to 
“that moment when you ?g-
ure out how to develop your 
idea, or when you ?gure 
out what you’re passionate 
about.”
This year, TEDxCMU fea-
tured Jon Clark, Jenn Lim, 
Darell Hammond, Judy 
Swan, Rodrigo Arboleda, Eve 
Picker, Linda Benedict-Jones, 
Jeff Ferrell, and Rob Daley, 
as well as ?rst-year computa-
tional biology major Rebecca 
Alford and senior directing 
major Stephen Tonti.
TED began in 1987 as a 
conference to bring together 
the worlds of technology, 
entertainment, and design. 
According to TED’s website, 
their mission is to spread 
ideas and change the world, 
noting that, “we’re building 
here a clearinghouse that 
offers free knowledge and 
inspiration from the world’s 
most inspired thinkers, and 
also a community of curious 
souls to engage with ideas 
and each other.”
TEDxCMU is indepen-
dently organized; TED’s 
website describes such TEDx 
events as “giv[ing] commu-
nities, organizations and in-
dividuals the opportunity to 
stimulate dialogue through 
TED-like experiences at the 
local level.”
Continuing a practice that 
began last year, this year’s 
TEDxCMU featured two 
Carnegie Mellon undergrad-
uate students as speakers: 
Rebecca Alford and Stephen 
Tonti. Compared to only 18 
entries last year, this year’s 
contest to be a student speak-
er generated 55 student en-
tries, Desai said.
Sophia Nanda, a sopho-
more physics major in atten-
dance at TEDxCMU, talked 
about the ?rst speaker of 
the day. Jon Clark, medical 
director at Red Bull Stratos, 
described his work on the 
team that organized Felix 
Baumgartner’s record-break-
ing jump from the strato-
sphere on Oct. 14, 2012.
“As a science student, I 
saw [Clark’s] bio before com-
ing and he was what I was 
waiting to hear about. It was 
really amazing seeing one of 
his applied projects come to 
life; it’s something I want to 
do later in life,” Nanda said.
First-year economics ma-
jor Cynthia Hsia commented 
on the message of collabora-
tion that Clark spoke about. 
“It was really inspiring, es-
pecially with the video that 
he showed. It was cool to see 
how everyone as an individu-
al made it work together.”
The next speaker, Eve 
Picker, chief executive of-
?cer at cityLAB Pittsburgh, 
focused on what she called 
the “cure for the common 
city.” Picker explained the 
difference between bottom-
up and top-down city design, 
using Pittsburgh’s CONSOL 
Energy Center as an example 
of an expensive, top-down 
project and the Toonseum in 
Downtown as an example of

Katie Stoebe, the execu-
tive director of the Carnegie 
Mellon Center for Interna-
tional Relations and Politics, 
and Emily Half, an under-
graduate academic adviser 
in the Dietrich College of Hu-
manities and Social Sciences, 
recently announced that the 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity Washington Semester 
Program (CMUWSP) is be-
ing restructured. The new 
program will be launched in 
January 2014, meaning that 
CMUWSP will not be offered 
during the upcoming fall 
2013 semester.
The CMUWSP currently 
sends students to George-
town University for academic 
study while they participate 
in an internship; Carnegie 
Mellon supplements their ex-
perience with extracurricular 
events and internship search 
support. In the new program, 
however, Carnegie Mellon 
will no longer be partnered 
with Georgetown. Instead, 
Carnegie Mellon will be part 
of a consortium of schools 
partnered with the Univer-
sity of California Washing-
ton Center (UCDC). These 
universities include the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame, the 
University of Michigan, the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
and Washington University 
in St. Louis. Carnegie Mellon 
students will take classes in 
the UCDC building — only 
?ve blocks from the White 
House. Courses will be taught 
by a combination of Carnegie 
Mellon and UCDC faculty, 
and with the new program, 
there will be more core and 
elective course options.
“Don’t get us wrong, our 
students have had good ex-
periences at Georgetown, but 
we’re really excited about the 
opportunity to grow Carn-
egie Mellon’s presence in 
Washington and develop our 
own program there,” Half 
said.
The internship aspect 
of the CMUWSP will be re-
tained; students will still 
complete an internship of 
their choosing while study-
ing in Washington, D.C. Al-
though students will apply 
and interview for internships 
on their own, affording them 
a real-world experience, a 
full-time adviser based in 
Washington, D.C. will be 
available to help guide their 
search. Additionally, the 
Carnegie Mellon Center for 
International Relations and 
Politics has an extensive da-
tabase of descriptions and 
deadlines for over 360 intern-
ships, the majority of which 
are in Washington, D.C. 
In the past, Carnegie Mel-
lon students have completed 
internships for government 
organizations, nonpro?t or-
ganizations, lobbying ?rms, 
and think tanks. Students 
interested in the program 
are encouraged to research 
internships well in advance, 
as deadlines can approach 
earlier than expected, espe-
cially for government orga-
nizations such as the State 
Department and the White 
House.
In the spring 2014 semes-
ter, CMUWSP students will 
live in Washington Intern 
Student Housing (WISH). 
Carnegie Mellon students 
will live together in a WISH 
University initiative aims to support alumni entrepreneurs
ALVIN MATHEW
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon has been 
offering students and alumni 
an opportunity to start their 
own businesses since June 
2012 with support from the 
Open Field Entrepreneur’s 
Fund (OFEF). 
This fund awards money 
and resources to Carnegie 
Mellon alumni who graduated  
within the past ?ve years.
David Mawhinney, an as-
sistant teaching professor of 
entrepreneurship at the Tep-
per School of Business, serves 
as managing director of the 
fund.
“The fund was made possi-
ble by a gift from a gentleman, 
Jonathan Kaplan,” Mawhin-
ney said, “who created the Flip 
Video camera and later sold it 
to Cisco Systems. 
His wife, Marci Glazer, also 
helped found the fund. It’s a 
fund for young alumni from 
zero to ?ve years of gradua-
tion to make their own jobs 
and follow their dreams.”
The OFEF is part of the 
“Greenlighting Startups” ini-
tiative at Carnegie Mellon, 
which aims to promote and 
translate ideas and creations 
from labs to the market. Last 
year, the fund awarded a total 
of $300,000 to six different 
startup companies, each re-
ceiving $50,000.
There is a comprehensive 
application process to select 
companies. “If you meet your 
eligibility requirements, you 
are asked to make a pitch. 
But you have to be serious to 
convince another investor to 
commit $50,000,” Mawhinney 
said.
One company that received 
funding from the OFEF is 
PECA Labs, which focuses on 
rare cardiovascular and pe-
diatric conditions. Doug Ber-
nstein (CIT ’12), a Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus who double 
majored in mechanical engi-
neering and biomedical en-
gineering, is the founder and 
CEO of PECA Labs. Bernstein 
feels that children with certain 
heart conditions often have 
insuf?cient products used in 
their heart procedures.
“Intra-operative conduits 
had to be developed from 
scratch by the doctor in the op-
erating room for 30 minutes,” 
Bernstein said. In response 
to this issue, the company 
created the Masa Valve, de-
scribed on PECA’s website as 
“a synthetic valve conduit for 
pediatric RVOT (right ventri-
cle out?ow tract) reconstruc-
tion.” The product would be a 
quicker, simpler solution that 
doctors could use on patients 
during heart surgeries.
The company is still in the 
process of getting regulatory 
approval for selling its prod-
uct, but according to Bern-
stein, it will be an excellent 
option for parents and their 
children. Only a small market 
of individuals are affected by 
this issue, so no other compa-
nies have come up with more 
affordable options because of 
the $70-million fee attached 
to bringing the device to mar-
ket. Bernstein hopes to bring 
this fee down to less than 
$750,000.
StatEasy, another company 
supported by the OFEF, takes 
videos and statistics from 
sports teams and creates a 
simple system that can be used 
by coaches, players, and fami-
lies to view them. Chief oper-
ating of?cer Tom Matta (TSB 
’07) explains, “We’re turning 
media into a new platform … 
on an iPad instead of paper.” 
After every game, the com-

Franz Franchetti, an as-
sociate research professor of 
electrical and computer en-
gineering, received a $6-mil-
lion grant from the U.S. De-
fense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA).
The grant provided by 
DARPA will be used to devel-
op new software in order to 
protect motor vehicles from 
incoming cyberattacks.
 Franchetti’s project is part 
of a DARPA effort called the 
High-Assurance Cyber Mili-
tary System, which hopes 
to develop a greater level of 
security to protect against 
against cyberthreats.
“This is an extremely chal-
lenging project as we work to 
develop secure robotic sys-
tems that are resilient to cy-
berattacks,” Franchetti said 
in a university press release.
Franchetti will spearhead 
the software development 
project and will be joined 
by Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members.
 The professors collaborat-
ing with Franchetti on this 
project include professor of 
electrical and computer en-
gineering José M. F. Moura, 
professor of computer sci-
ence Maria Manuela Veloso, 
assistant professor of com-
puter science André Platzer, 
and assistant research profes-
sor of electrical and computer 
engineering Soummya Kar.
Cyberthreats targeting 
motor vehicles are growing 
to be a major problem for the 
economy, resulting in billions 
of dollars in lost revenue, 
according to a recent U.S. 
Department of Commerce 
report. 
“Gauging an appropri-
ate response to any of these 
cyberhreats is daunting, but 
we have the innovative tal-
ent and research expertise 
to begin developing some 
long-range solutions,” Ed 
Schlesinger, professor of en-
gineering and the head of the 
electrical and computer engi-
neering department said in a 
university press release.
The team’s research will 
also include improvement in 
GPS disruption in ground ve-
hicles and high-end cars.

CMU robot nominated for Edison Awards
A robotic system devel-
oped at Carnegie Mellon 
to strip paint known as the 
Advanced Robotic Laser 
Coating Removal System 
(ARLCRS) was named a 
2013 ?nalist for the Edison 
Awards.
The system, which was 
created by the National Ro-
botics Engineering Center 
and the Concurrent Technol-
ogies Corporation, works by 
utilizing high-power lasers 
on mobile robotic platforms 
to remove paint from air-
craft.
The ARLCRS is a ?nalist 
in material science, one of 
12 categories honored by the 
Edison Awards. 
The Edison Awards annu-
ally recognizes the most in-
novative new products, ser-
vices, and business leaders 
in the United States. 
The ballot of nominees for 
the Edison Awards is judged 
by around 3,000 national se-
nior business executives and 
academics.
According to a univer-
sity press release, the distin-
guished awards symbolize 
the persistence and excel-
lence personi?ed by Thomas 
Edison, inspiring creative 
minds to remain in the fore-
front of innovation, creativ-
ity, and ingenuity in the 
global economy.
The awards will be pre-
sented April 24–25 at the 
Edison Awards Annual Gala 
in Chicago.

Under Construction encourages students to build skills, careers
JOSEPH WHITE
Junior Staffwriter
Dietrich College of Hu-
manities and Social Sciences 
recently launched Under Con-
struction, a networking event 
intended to connect current 
Dietrich College students with 
alumni who have made suc-
cessful careers in a variety of 
?elds, including public policy, 
entrepreneurship, and tech-
nology. Hosted on Feb. 23, at 
the Oakland Holiday Inn, the 
event consisted of lunch with 
alumni of Carnegie Mellon’s 
humanities programs, fol-
lowed by a panel session.
“Your education allows 
you to go in many directions,” 
said Deitrich College con-
sultant Debra Ignelzi. “This 
event is about learning how to 
do that.”
Before the alumni entered 
the event, senior decision 
science major Chris Sparks 
offered advice on how to in-
teract with the alumni and po-
tential recruiters. “You need 
to present yourself in such a 
way that they remember you,” 
Sparks said, explaining that 
he often introduces himself 
to potential employers with 
the phrase, “I see myself as a 
lighthouse.”
As the event began, Bev-
erley Wheeler (DC ’76, HNZ 
’78), the former president of 
the Carnegie Mellon Alumni 
Association, opened with 
words of encouragement for 
the students “to take advan-
tage of the alumni associa-
tion.” She reassured the stu-
dents that the alumni would 
be incredible resources for 
them.
Keynote speaker Joshua 
Knauer (DC ’95) pointed out 
many examples of men and 
women who have formed 
successful companies with 
their “soft” degrees, including 
himself. Knauer has a degree 
in environmental ethics and 
policy. Since graduating, he 
founded a successful Internet-
based business, Rhiza Labs, 
and also served on the Presi-
dent’s Council of Advisors on 
Science and Technology.
“Those of you sitting here 
are going to have at least sev-
en jobs in your career life,” he 
said, emphasizing the need 
for creativity in a job market 
that lacks job security. Knauer 
went on to address the in?u-
ence of the upcoming eco-
nomic sequester by the feder-
al government, and how this 
situation emphasizes the need 
for one to further develop 
one’s career. This fact, Knauer 
noted, especially applies to 
those who wish to work in 
startups. In an interview after 
his speech, Knauer cemented 
this concept, adding that “a 
startup is inherently irratio-
nal.”
Knauer added that the cre-
ativity inherent in the liberal 
arts helps much more than 
the more technical degrees 
do, but he still believes that 
“it’s better to have some con-
trol over your future career.”
In her speech, Emily Feen-
stra, a senior international 
relations and politics and pol-
icy and management double 
major, encouraged her fel-
low students to ask questions 
about the advantages and 
disadvantages of the alumni’s 
?elds.
The panels offered at Un-
der Construction provided an 
open forum of discussion for 
students. 
The topics included mar-
keting, education, museums, 
public health, and think 
tanks.
In the panel focused on en-
trepreneurship, students were 
given guidance on how to ask 
for money from investors.
“I learned a lot of valu-
able things about the life of 
a consultant,” junior policy 
and management major Bran-
den Wiles said of the discus-
sion at the entrepreneurship 
panel. “It’s so general and so 
broad, to have CMU alumni 
coming to tell you about it ... 
is de?nitely a valuable insight 
to have.”
Regarding the panel on 
think tanks, Stanley Krasner, 
a sophomore economics and 
math double major, stated, “I 
think it represented a really 
nice cross-section of alumni 
who all had interesting stories 
and perspectives.” 
Krasner also served on the 
student committee advising 
the event.
The feedback on the pro-
gram from attending students 
was generally positive. 
“Under Construction was 
a great experience for me.... I 
was able to talk to and learn 
from Dietrich alumni who are 
in the midst of doing what 
I want to do,” sophomore 
international relations and 
politics major Chloe Hawker 
stated via email. “I learned a 
lot about the industries and 
made some contacts with 
whom I’m excited to follow up 
and cultivate a professional 
relationship.”
Sophomore creative and 
professional writing double 
major Jaime Fawcett thought 
the event was informative. “It 
was really cool seeing what 
alumni from Dietrich College 
are doing,” she said. 
However, Fawcett felt 
that the event also had some 
shortcomings, saying that stu-
dents did not have ample time 
to pose questions to many of 
the speakers once their pre-
sentations had concluded.
Overall, Fawcett believed 
the event was useful. 
“I think it is a good pro-
cess, but I feel like they should 
open it up to freshmen.” 
She thought that ?rst-year 
students would bene?t from 
the stories of alumni just as 
much as upper class students 
would.
As the event neared its 
end, Feenstra closed the gath-
ering by saying, “You’re build-
ing on your experiences, not 
?guring out your end goal.”
TEDxCMU draws large crowd of students to see speakers
a cheaper, bottom-up method 
for revitalization.
“Imagine a city where 5 
million visits are generated 
by 13,000 small projects — 
that’s a cure for the common 
city,” Picker said.
Rachel Fowler, a ?rst-year 
business administration ma-
jor, said she liked that Picker 
“focused on improving cities 
in ways that no one has really 
focused on before.”
Linda Benedict-Jones, cu-
rator of photography at the 
Carnegie Museum of Art and 
adjunct professor at Carnegie 
Mellon, talked about her jour-
ney as a photographer after 
getting her bachelor’s degree 
in English literature.
Holly Dennis, a ?rst-year 
dramaturgy major, said that 
she admired Benedict-Jones’ 
passion for photography. “I’m 
taking my ?rst photography 
class this semester, and that 
was really inspiring because 
I’ve always had a passion for 
photography, but just dabbled 
in it. [Benedict-Jones] talked 
about the magic of print and 
stuff and it really is magic; it’s 
crazy magic.”
TEDxCMU also featured 
a performance by ?rst-year 
MBA student Chinmayi Bha-
vanishankar, who performed 
a classical South Indian dance 
and talked about her passion 
for the narrative nature of 
Bharatanatyam dance. 
She emphasized how Indi-
an dancing has evolved from a 
hobby to a passion and into a 
daily routine that she cannot 
imagine living without. 
In the second half of the 
event, The Originals, Carn-
egie Mellon’s all-male a cap-
pella group, also performed, 
engaging the crowd with a 
few songs, including a mash-
up of two popular songs.
The last speaker before the 
lunch break was Robert Dal-
ey, the chief executive of?cer 
of 4moms. 
Daley showcased several 
baby products produced by 
his company that used robot-
ics to make them “dramati-
cally better.” 
One of the devices fea-
tured was the mamaRoo, a 
baby seat that mimics the 
natural rocking and bouncing 
motions of a mother comfort-
ing her child.
After lunch, ?rst-year 
biological sciences major Re-
becca Alford gave her talk. Al-
ford has congenital stationary 
night blindness, a rare, incur-
able disease that impairs her 
vision.
“I can see about half of 
what the normal individual 
can see,” Alford said. “What 
was most important about 
this was that it introduced the 
idea of adaptation. The real-
ity was that there wouldn’t be 
some change or cure for my 
condition any time soon.”
Alford’s condition led her 
to do novel computational 
biology research as a 14-year- 
old at her high school and at 
the Bonneau Laboratory at 
New York University.
Jenn Lim, the next speak-
er, spoke about Delivering 
Happiness, a company she 
co-founded with Tony Hsieh, 
chief executive of?cer of 
Zappos.com. According to her 
presentation at TEDxCMU, 
Lim described Delivering 
Happiness as a way “to inspire 
science-based happiness, pas-
sion and purpose at work, 
home and everyday life.”
Chairman and chief execu-
tive of?cer of One Laptop per 
Child Association (OLPCA) 
Rodrigo Arboleda gave his 
lecture on “provid[ing] equal 
opportunity of access to 
knowledge to small children 
in developing nations and in 
some communities within the 
USA.”
Jeff Ferrell, professor of 
sociology at Texas Christian 
University and visiting pro-
fessor of criminology at the 
University of Kent, gave a talk 
about “the broader issues that 
we confront in our lives, such 
as ... what rules are made and 
why, the issues we confront as 
citizens ... [and] going over to 
an area beyond those rules.”
Senior directing major 
Stephen Tonti began his talk 
stating that he had ADHD and 
continued to speak about how 
this disorder led him to his 
passion of directing. He had 
a light-hearted approach to 
his speech, emphasizing that 
because of his ADHD he had 
the opportunity to explore all 
different avenues in discover-
ing his zeal. 
The talks at TEDxCMU 
were interspersed with videos 
of lectures from other TEDx 
events. TEDxCMU brought to-
gether speakers from all fac-
ets of study and experience, 
allowing students to gain new 
perspective. It challenged 
students to think about their 
own goals and their futures  
in terms of helping change 
the world.

pany hopes to provide every 
player with his or her own 
highlights. StatEasy is being 
used by 200 sports teams, in-
cluding those in the Navy and 
at Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity. However, “The future of 
our media products is with 
high school athletic leagues,” 
Bernstein said. 
Tunessence, a company 
created by alumni Alex Soto 
(CIT ’11) and Matthew Bauch 
(CIT ’12), aspires to be an en-
gaging online guitar teacher. 
“The ultimate goal is to be 
the Rosetta Stone of music by 
combining music technology 
with teaching,” Soto said. 
On the website, indi-
viduals are given access to 
audio processing software 
and instructional videos. 
Tunessence’s software then 
provides individuals with 
note-by-note feedback, tracks 
progress and personalizes 
lessons. “So we use software 
to do what private teachers 
would do,” Soto said.
The OFEF also invested 
$50,000 in Aurochs Brewing 
Company. Ryan Bove (TSB 
’12) said that he and his busi-
ness partner, Doug Foster, 
have had to be on a gluten-
free diet on a daily basis for 
medical reasons; soon, he 
explained, “We [will] make a 
gluten-free beer.”
Aurochs Brewing, accord-
ing to Bove, is commercial-
izing a speci?c brew using 
millet, quinoahops, and ama-
ranth. “Most beers,” he said, 
“use barley and wheat, and 
sometimes have corn and 
rice.” Aurochs Brewing has 
a brewery in Emsworth, Pa., 
about 10–15 minutes from 
Pittsburgh. The company ex-
pects to have a federal and 
state process complete in “the 
next couple weeks or so,” and 
plans on launching in late 
spring 2013. 
It currently has one brew 
?avor, and two others will be 
unveiled during the spring 
and summer.
Scott Sykora (CFA ’12) co-
founded Pixite. 
“We make photography 
apps for the iPhone and iPad. 
Our most popular apps give 
users access to their photo li-
braries in Picasa Web Albums, 
Facebook, and Flickr on their 
iPad and iPhones,” Sykora 
said.
These apps are meant to 
make popular services more 
useful and “essentially re-
place the browser interface 
they would normally need 
to go through.” For example, 
Sykora mentioned that his 
company’s most recent app, 
Unbound, provides this ser-
vice for Dropbox.
The fund does not favor in-
novation in any speci?c ?eld; 
the six selected companies 
from last year focused on a 
variety of ?elds. Mawhinney 
also notes that in the past 
year, the fund has supported 
and invested in 16 different 
companies throughout the 
U.S.
While providing ?nancial 
contributions to startup com-
panies is its primary focus, 
the fund also provides perks 
for current students, includ-
ing an invitation to go to a 
yearly OFEF personalized 
mentorship program. Start-
ups are assigned at least one 
mentor.
These six companies uti-
lized the ?nancial support 
provided to them by the fund. 
“Being able to say CMU made 
a $50,000 investment in us is 
a big deal,” Bernstein said.
“Carnegie Mellon in gen-
eral has done a lot to provide 
us with help and having that 
Carnegie Mellon name be-
hind us is a big deal,” Matta 
said. “We’ve since raised 
$250,000, and as a humani-
tarian company, it’s a big deal 
for us.”
“It’s great to be acknowl-
edged as a Carnegie Mellon 
product,” Soto said. 
Regarding the aid received 
from the fund, Soto added, 
“It’s been super helpful. We’ve 
hired [a] bunch of people. It 
allows us to go from proto-
type to a working product, 
and to raise more capital from 
a proven product.”
Sykora also spoke glowing-
ly of the fund, saying, “We’ve 
been growing as a company 
and are looking into what our 
next steps could be. One thing 
we’re starting to explore is be-
coming more of a web service 
company instead of just cre-
ating stand-alone apps. The 
OFEF sponsorship is really 
helping us move toward that. 
It’s letting us grow faster than 
we would have without it.”
Additionally, the compa-
nies also appreciate the men-
torship aspect of the OFEF 
sponsorship. 
“We’re also hoping to 
gain a strong set of advisers 
and connections through the 
OFEF and CMU Alumni net-
work,” Sykora said.
Bernstein appreciates hav-
ing his designated adviser, 
Craig Markovitz. “We’re a 
young company with young 
entrepreneurs,” he said. 
“There’s a lot of passion, but 
not experience, so having a 
mentor is great.”
Bove also had similar 
views. “The money is very 
helpful, but what’s really im-
portant is the mentorship and 
having people such as Dave 
giving advice and helping us 
troubleshoot problems before 
they even become problems,” 
Bove said of Mawhinney.
Every year there will be 
two cycles in which the fund 
selects startup companies — 
once in May and once in De-
cember. 
The deadline for the most 
recent cycle was on March 1, 
but graduates will be able to 
apply again in the fall.

In the future, Carnegie 
Mellon is planning for stu-
dents to live in UCDC hous-
ing, which mainly includes 
two-bedroom, four-person 
apartments with kitchens and 
living rooms.
Although it seems like re-
structuring the program was 
an abrupt decision, Stoebe 
said that changes to the 
CMUWSP have been in discus-
sion for many years. “Things 
just kind of picked up in the 
fall semester and moved a 
lot faster than we had antici-
pated. We had wanted to do 
this program for the longest 
time and it just seemed like 
everything started falling into 
place,” Stoebe explained.
The CMUWSP will not be 
offered in the fall 2013 se-
mester, because the program 
managers want to dedicate all 
of their time and resources to 
launching the program suc-
cessfully and problem free 
in spring 2014. Although the 
CMUWSP website still says 
they are accepting applica-
tions for the fall 2013 pro-
gram, emails were sent to 
Carnegie Mellon academic 
advisers asking them to in-
form students of the changes. 
Additionally, three informa-
tion sessions regarding the 
new CMUWSP were held in 
February.
After attending a CMUWSP 
information session, sopho-
more psychology and philoso-
phy double major Lavender Yi 
said, “It was unexpected that 
the Washington Semester 
Program is undergoing recon-
struction. I had absolutely no 
idea until I went to one of the 
information sessions a few 
weeks ago. I really do like the 
new options for the spring se-
mester of 2014. However, I do 
wish they were still partnered 
with Georgetown, because I 
heard about wonderful ex-
periences and I wish I could 
have had those experiences 
as well. I expect a lot of great 
things to happen in the spring 
though, and I can’t wait to 
hear more about the program 
... in the fall.”
Stoebe and Half are hop-
ing to send 10–12 undergrad-
uate students each semester 
to Washington, D.C. There are 
currently 11 students partici-
pating in the CMUWSP spring 
2013 program. The majority 
of students who apply to the 
program are selected, but as 
Half said, “It’s not that it’s 
not a selective program, but 
I think that it’s self-selecting. 
We want students to have 
this opportunity, so unless we 
think there’s an academic rea-
son or some other reason why 
you shouldn’t be in D.C., we 
want you to go.”
Applicants are advised to 
have at least a 3.0 QPA and to 
plan their semester schedules 
ahead of time. “Academics 
need to come ?rst. You need 
to be a strong student in Pitts-
burgh to be a strong student 
at Carnegie Mellon in D.C.,” 
Half said.

Susceptibility to ?u may be found in your chromosomes
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
How often do you get a 
cold? Have you noticed that 
you get sick more or less often 
than your friends? Carnegie 
Mellon Robert E. Doherty Pro-
fessor of Psychology Sheldon 
Cohen recently identi?ed a 
biological marker — an indi-
cator of a biological state — 
that corresponds with one’s 
susceptibility to the common 
cold.
Telomeres are cap-like pro-
tein complexes found at the 
ends of chromosomes whose 
function is to protect those 
chromosomes during replica-
tion. It has long been known 
that as you age and undergo 
more cell replication, your 
telomeres shorten, leading to 
the possibility of aging-related 
diseases. What is remarkable 
about Cohen’s work is the dis-
covery that telomere length 
not only predicts susceptibil-
ity of disease in the elderly, 
but also does so for younger 
people.
Cohen cites two reasons 
that led him to conduct a study 
on the correlation between 
telomere length in young 
adults and their ability to ?ght 
off disease: “First, even though 
telomere length decreases as 
we age, the evidence suggest-
ed that there was variation in 
telomere length even in young 
adults. Second, telomere 
length is often measured in 
white blood cells. Our interest 
is in how the immune system 
responds to infectious agents 
like cold viruses,” he said. 
“The most prevalent diseases 
in the age group we study, 
18-to-55-year-olds, are upper 
respiratory infections, and it 
seemed to us that those with 
shorter telomeres in key white 
blood cells would be less able 
to prevent cold viruses from 
replicating.”
Indeed, the results of Co-
hen’s experiments aligned 
with his prediction. Cohen 
and his team measured the 
telomere length of white 
blood cells in 152 volunteers 
between the ages of 18 and 55. 
These volunteers were then 
quarantined for ?ve days af-
ter being exposed to the virus 
that causes the common cold. 
“We have studied the role of 
psychological and behavioral 
factors in the common cold 
for over 30 years. Unlike most 
diseases, we can actually ex-
perimentally expose people 
to the disease-causing agent. 
Hence, colds have provided 
an excellent model for us,” 
Cohen said.
The results of the experi-
ment showed that individuals 
with shorter telomere length 
were more likely to contract 
the common cold than those 
with longer telomeres. An-
other result of their experi-
ment was the discovery that 
telomere length only started 
predicting an individual’s 
susceptibility to the common 
cold for those who were about 
22 or older. Telomere length 
was increasingly indicative of 
an individual’s ability to ?ght 
off disease as the age of the 
individual increased. “The 
increased importance of telo-
mere length with age is likely 
because the younger partici-
pants had fewer very short 
telomeres, or that their young 
immune systems were able to 
compensate for the loss of ef-
fective cells,” Cohen said in a 
university press release.
Sheldon and his team 
also found that a particular 
type of white blood cell — a 
CD8CD28- T-cytolytic cell — 
was the best indicator of the 
likelihood of contracting the 
cold because the telomeres 
found in CD8CD28- cells 
shorten at a more rapid speed 
than those found in other cell 
types.
Now that it’s known that 
telomere length corresponds 
with an individual’s ability 
to ?ght off disease, the obvi-
ous question one might ask is, 
what factors — besides natu-
ral aging — affect telomere 
length?
“Shorter telomere length 
is associated with traumaatic 
childhood experiences, with 
exposure to chronic enduring 
stressors, with poor health 
behaviors such as smoking 
and excessive consumption 
of alcohol, with lower levels 
of education, and with stable 
psychological dispositions like 
hostility,” Cohen said. These 
factors may decrease telomere 
length through their effects on 
telomerase — an enzyme that 
rebuilds telomeres.
Further studies with other 
viruses and natural infections 
will increase the understand-
ing of how telomere length 
corresponds to susceptibility 
to disease. Perhaps, in the fu-
ture, telomeres will be the key 
to improving human health.
HOW THINGS WORKThe potential bene?ts of gene therapy
RAGHUNANADAN AVULA
Staffwriter
Since the discovery of DNA 
in the ’50s, scientists have 
been trying to understand 
exactly how it can in?uence 
minuscule details of a living 
organism. Modern techniques 
of genetic engineering aim 
to manipulate an organism’s 
genome in order to change 
biological mechanisms at the 
molecular level. These tech-
niques are being applied to a 
variety of ?elds — from medi-
cine to agriculture — and 
with recent breakthroughs in 
genetic engineering, unbe-
lievable ideas such as cloning 
may not be so far-fetched.
DNA exists in the cells of 
all living organisms and stores 
information on how the cell 
should grow, proliferate, and 
interact with neighboring 
cells. DNA is comprised of 
genes, which function as reci-
pes for how cells should build 
proteins. These proteins then 
control everything the living 
organism does by facilitating 
speci?c chemical reactions. 
This can be thought of as a 
“lock-and-key” mechanism of 
sorts: A protein with the cor-
rect shape can bind perfectly 
around certain molecules and 
force their interactions.
For example, one of the ap-
proximately 25,000 genes in 
a human cell contains the in-
formation on how to build the 
protein lactase. This protein 
binds to and breaks down the 
complex sugar lactose into rel-
atively simple glucose, which 
is vital for the cell to make en-
ergy. If someone doesn’t have 
the gene for lactase or if the 
protein is not built correctly 
by the cell, that person will ex-
perience symptoms of lactose 
intolerance.
However, the protein lac-
tase is generally only found 
in the cells of the digestive 
system. These cells have the 
same DNA as the cells in the 
brain, but the proteins found 
in each cell make them func-
tion differently — it would be 
a waste of energy for a cell to 
build a protein that it didn’t 
need.
To ensure this, DNA’s in-
?uence on (or expression of) 
proteins is heavily regulated 
within the cell. Every gene 
consists of a controller re-
gion that must be activated in 
order for that gene to be ex-
pressed into a protein. In the 
case of lactase, cells in the di-
gestive system recognize that 
lactose is present and needs 
to be broken down. Only then 
will a speci?c molecule bind 
to a controller region for the 
lactase gene so that the pro-
tein-building part of the cell 
will receive the recipe and 
then protein will be made by 
the cell.
According to PBS, tech-
niques of genetic engineering 
aim to manipulate this pro-
cess of protein expression in 
cells to impact their functions. 
Scientists have the ability 
to introduce new genes into 
the genome, so that the cells 
produce a protein that wasn’t 
present before. For example, 
in agriculture, genetically 
modi?ed fruits are forced to 
express speci?c proteins to 
increase their health ben-
e?ts, increase growth rates, 
or increase their resistance to 
pathogens.
People who suffer from 
diabetes don’t have the ability 
to create insulin in the pancre-
as that allows their bodies to 
take glucose from their blood. 
With the power of genetic en-
gineering, the gene to produce 
insulin was introduced into 
the E. coli genome so that, as 
these bacteria grow, they pro-
duce large amount of insulin. 
This can be collected and given 
to patients so that their bodies 
can then function normally.
The current hot topic of 
genetic research is the battle 
against cancer. Cancer is the 
unregulated growth of cells, 
largely due to DNA damage, 
where protein expression 
deviates from the norm and 
results in a pernicious attack 
on the body. Using a protein 
called nuclease, scientists 
can target and remove spe-
ci?c genes from the genome 
of a group of cells so that the 
protein won’t be made, ideally 
preventing the unregulated 
growth. The challenge is that 
cells have intricate levels of 
complexity, and simply add-
ing and removing genes can 
lead to drastic effects. 
Proteins play important 
roles in long pathways of 
chemical reactions; modify-
ing these pathways must be 
done with caution. Still, there 
is a lot of hope that, by using 
various genetic engineering 
techniques, cancer can be 
defeated.
Techniques are also used 
to remove certain disease-
causing genes from newborns 
so that they won’t suffer. It 
may also (at some point) be 
possible for parents to person-
alize their children by control-
ling the genes that express 
certain traits. This is where 
genetic engineering starts to 
walk the ?ne line of medical 
ethics.
Manipulating DNA allows 
us to change every aspect of a 
living organism, and the pos-
sibilities are endless. In the 
late ‘90s, scientists successful-
ly took the DNA from a living 
sheep and used it to produce 
an exact clone, which they 
named Dolly. Since then, oth-
er animals have been cloned 
by scientists as they aim to 
learn more about the power of 
genetics.
The past three decades 
have largely been character-
ized by a technological revo-
lution. Many scientists see the 
next few decades as de?ned by 
a genetic revolution by using 
the power of DNA to do every-
thing from growing healthier 
foods to curing cancer.
Researchers ?nd possible genetic links in psychiatry
A new study by Jordan 
Smoller, professor of psy-
chiatry at Harvard Medical 
School, has found similari-
ties in genomes linking ?ve 
very different psychiatric 
disorders: schizophrenia, bi-
polar disorder, autism, clini-
cal depression, and attention 
de?cit hyperactive disorder 
(ADHD). The ?ndings sug-
gest that these disorders 
have roots in areas of the 
genome that code for major 
brain-signaling functions 
and may help to treat the 
disorders in the future.
The study was based on 
genetic data amassed from 
over 60,000 participants — 
both with and without ill-
ness — all around the world. 
The writers of the paper sug-
gest that this could be the 
largest collaborative genetic 
study to date.

Big meteorite hunters travel to Antarctica
A team of meteorite 
hunters traveling across the 
East Antarctic Plateau on 
snowmobiles in late Janu-
ary stumbled across quite a 
large ?nd. A meteorite, found 
buried in the snow, weighed 
in at about 40 pounds (18 ki-
lograms) of space rock. The 
meteorite turned out to be 
a chondrite, one of the most 
common types of meteors 
and the same type as the Rus-
sian meteor that landed in Si-
beria last month.
The expedition, which is a 
common exodus for scientists 
excited about meteorites, col-
lected 425 meteorites — a 
total of 165 pounds in extra-
terrestrial rock. However, 
largest among these by far 
was the 40-pounder, making 
it the largest meteorite found 
in eastern Antarctica in the 
past 25 years.

Prehistoric craters could have helped expedite life
A new study of an impact 
crater in Finland has sug-
gested that meteors could 
have created ideal condi-
tions for the creation of life 
in Earth’s early stages. While 
previous knowledge of the 
hydrothermal environments 
created by these craters ac-
cepted that they are ben-
e?cial to life forms, the new 
study suggests that these 
environments could have 
lasted for up to 1.6 million 
years, 10 times longer than 
previously thought.
The same report suggest-
ed that similar craters could 
have existed on Mars. Con-
tinuing research will help to 
determine whether thermal 
activity like this is unique to 
Finland’s crater, known as 
Lappajärvi, or if it is common 
to all similarly sized craters. 
These studies will hopefully 
shed more light on how life 
may have evolved on Earth, 
as well as give scientists a 
way to determine on which 
planets it may be likely for 
life to prosper.

Biological molecules found in cosmic dust
Researchers using the Na-
tional Science Foundation’s 
Green Bank Telescope in 
West Virginia found several 
basic biological component 
molecules in a gas cloud al-
most 25,000 light-years from 
Earth. Chemists believe that 
one chemical, cyanometha-
nimine, is one of the critical 
agents in the formation of 
the DNA nucleotide base ade-
nine. The other key molecule 
discovered, called ethana-
mine, is thought to be essen-
tial in the creation of alanine, 
one of the 20 amino acids 
that make up all proteins.
The discoveries at this dis-
tance suggest that gas clouds 
like this could seed biological 
precursor particles through-
out the galaxy. However, 
both molecules discovered 
require multistep biological 
processes, which are quite 
complicated, before they 
evolve to anything of biologi-
cal signi?cance.

Universities must not punish sexual assault victims
News sources have recently re-
ported several cases of universities 
mishandling or covering up cases 
of sexual assault on their campuses. 
When universities refuse to take re-
sponsibility for the prevention of sex-
ual assault on campuses, the school 
community suffers as a whole.
The University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill (UNC) has now joined 
the ranks of universities that have 
mishandled cases of sexual assault.
UNC sophomore Landen Gambill 
braves the possibility of expulsion 
   — because she claims that her ex-
boyfriend raped her, sexually and 
verbally abused her, and stalked and 
threatened her after they broke up.
Gambill ?rst came forward about 
her experiences as a sexual as-
sault survivor last December, when 
she told the UNC newspaper The 
Tar Heel about how she had ?led a 
complaint against her ex-boyfriend 
through the university. At the time, 
sexual assault complaints were han-
dled by the Honor Court, a student 
group meant to handle violations of 
the university Honor Code. She told 
the newspaper that her complaint 
was egregiously mishandled, with 
the court using her history of depres-
sion — a result of the abuse she suf-
fered — against her as a sign that she 
was too “emotionally unstable” to be 
believed.
About a month later, Gambill, 
several other students, and the uni-
versity’s former assistant dean of 
students ?led a complaint with the 
U.S. Department of Education’s Civil 
Rights Of?ce, alleging that the uni-
versity had violated numerous fed-
eral mandates in the way it handled 
sexual assault cases.
Shortly after she ?led the report, 
however, Gambill received an email 
from the Graduate & Professional 
Schools Student Attorney General 
Elizabeth Ireland, notifying her that 
she had been charged with an Honor 
Code violation by “intimidating” her 
rapist and “adversely” affecting his 
ability to participate in university life 
— simply because she had told news 
outlets about her experiences. She 
has never even publicly identi?ed 
her ex-boyfriend by name, but Gam-
bill says that at a preliminary Honor 
Court meeting, she was told that she 
could have violated the Honor Code 
simply by saying she was raped.
According to UNC, the university 
administration has played no part in 
these proceedings; in a statement it 
released last week, the university 
emphasized that the Honor Court is 
a student-administered process, and 
that “administrators may not encour-
age or prevent the Student Attorney 
Generals from ?ling charges in a 
speci?c case.” According to Gambill, 
however, an assistant dean actually 
helped her ex-boyfriend ?le the com-
plaint with the Honor Court.
It is appalling enough that Gam-
bill’s complaint was mishandled, 
but it is even more appalling that 
the university has decided to punish 
Gambill for coming forward about 
her experiences. Sexual assault is not 
only prevalent on college campuses 
— nearly one in four college women 
are victims of rape or attempted rape 
— but is also chronically underre-
ported, according to a guide released 
by the U.S. Department of Justice 
(DOJ).
The DOJ estimates that fewer 
than 5 percent of college women 
who are victims of rape or attempt-
ed rape report it the police, mostly 
due to the victim-blaming that oc-
curs when a sexual assault survivor 
decides to report, as evidenced by 
Gambill’s case. The university should 
be focusing on protecting its students 
by promoting a safe campus commu-
nity, rather than trying to protect its 
public image by silencing sexual as-
sault survivors.
Carnegie Mellon is in the process 
of remodeling its own sexual assault 
policy, under the guidance of Dean 
of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno. 
We are lucky to have an administra-
tion that is open to suggestions — in 
part through our increasingly com-
mon Town Halls — from students 
and faculty about policy changes. 
But if we at Carnegie Mellon can 
learn anything from Gambill’s horri-
ble experiences and UNC’s mistakes, 
it is that we as a campus community 
need to be aware and supportive of 
the sexual assault survivors on our 
own campus.
Frequent Blackboard outages demand conscious use
It is dif?cult to graduate from 
Carnegie Mellon without taking 
classes that require Blackboard. 
Carnegie Mellon students can access 
a customized version of the website 
through their Andrew accounts.
However, as of late this website 
has been more of a curse than a bless-
ing. Frequent outages and planned 
downtimes that last longer than an-
ticipated have plagued the system 
and frustrated users for weeks. This 
semester alone, there have been ap-
proximately eight downtimes. The 
latest outage occurred on Feb. 26, 
according to Blackboard’s downtime  
log, which can be found at  www.
cmu.edu/blackboard/downtime.
While these problems are being 
addressed and hopefuly remedied, 
students and teachers alike should 
still be conscious of how and when 
they use the website.
Professors and students should 
take into account that Blackboard al-
ready reminds users to have backups 
of every necessary ?le and to plan al-
ternative ways to collect work.
Instructors should provide some 
degree of leniency to students who 
are faced with Blackboard issues 
outside of their control, especially if 
they use Blackboard to collect work. 
Alternatively, professors could email 
students necessary documents or 
links they would normally put on 
Blackboard until the outages and 
downtimes have ended. 
By relying less on Blackboard, 
professors ensure that their proposed 
class schedules are not interrupted.
Likewise, students should take the 
current unreliability of Blackboard 
into account and do as much of their 
work of?ine as possible, uploading 
and downloading their documents at 
the earliest possible opportunity. 
Students should download in-
structions or save links for assign-
ments the day the professor an-
nounces that the materials are on 
Blackboard. By ensuring that they 
have the necessary items to complete 
assignments on their computers, 
students do not risk their ability to 
access the material the night before 
assignments are due.
While the reliability of Black-
board over the past few weeks has 
been troubling, we can only hope 
that lack of access to the website 
does not get in the way of students’ 
educations.

Matt Mastricova’s article last 
week, “Time to wage war for mini-
mum wage,” defends President 
Obama’s recent State of the Union 
proposal to raise minimum wage 
from $7.25 to $9 per hour by 2015. 
Mastricova cites studies from the 
University of California, Berkeley 
and the Center for Economic Policy 
and Research, which show that min-
imum wage increases have no im-
pact on employment. He concludes 
that minimum wage increases can 
only be good, as they give higher 
wages to low-skilled workers. What 
Mastricova forgets is that the social 
sciences are not exact sciences.
Running a simple regression of 
unemployment on minimum wage 
reveals an R-Squared value of only 
0.002. This means that only 0.2 per-
cent of the variation in unemploy-
ment can be explained by variation 
in minimum wage. Put another way, 
there is an incredibly large subset of 
factors that have an impact on un-
employment; the effect of minimum 
wage is negligible. Minimum wage 
didn’t change during the recession, 
yet we saw unemployment jump 
above 10 percent in late 2009.
According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS), North Dakota has 
the nation’s lowest unemployment 
rate at 3.2 percent. Economists at-
tribute this low unemployment rate 
mostly to the energy boom that’s go-
ing on in that region. The low rate 
has absolutely nothing to do with 
any policy North Dakota has put in 
place, but simply shows that North 
Dakota got lucky with its natural 
resources.
In social sciences, there is no way 
to run perfect tests. The only way to 
imply causation is to test one factor 
while holding all other factors con-
stant. This is impossible to do with 
economics because the economy 
doesn’t operate in a vacuum. You 
can’t test the effect of just one thing 
on a system where billions of peo-
ple are constantly moving money 
around for reasons spanning from 
the federal reserve’s quantitative 
easing to sheer whimsical thought.
With this in mind, the studies 
that Mastricova cites seem less rel-
evant. Minimum wage workers only 
comprise 5.2 percent of all hourly 
paid workers and 2.5 percent of all 
workers in the workforce, according 
to the BLS. These studies are based 
on the unemployment rate, which 
includes all workers. With 97.5 
percent of workers unaffected by 
changes in the minimum wage, it’s 
easy to see why studies that account 
for all workers as their population 
don’t ?nd any effect in minimum 
wage changes.
We can, however, see a demo-
graphic greatly affected by mini-
mum wage changes. According to 
the BLS, about half of minimum 
wage workers are under the age of 
25. A study on the U.S. minimum 
wage and teenage employment 
conducted by economists from the 
University of Cambridge, Univer-
sity College London, and Claremont 
McKenna College found statistically 
signi?cant evidence that increases 
in minimum wage negatively affect 
teenage unemployment, holding all 
other factors as constant as possible.
In economic theory, we see that 
minimum wages have destructive 
effects on the employment of low-
skilled workers. Employers don’t 
hire employees if they lose money 
by doing so. Minimum wages ensure 
that employers don’t hire any em-
ployee whose value is below the gov-
ernment-set threshold; 97.5 percent 
of workers fall above this threshold 
and are unaffected. 
The real losers to minimum wage 
are workers whose skills cannot earn 
them wages above the minimum. 
They don’t make more because of 
minimum wage. They just don’t get 
hired.
With this in mind, it doesn’t 
make sense for President Obama to 
push for wage increases that prevent 
job growth for the lower class. The 
real motivation for Democrats and 
liberal research institutions to push 
for minimum wage is that many 
union contracts set wages as a mul-
tiple of the minimum wage. Raising 
the minimum wage is just a way for 
Democrats to throw a bone to some 
of their biggest donors.
Because the social sciences are 
inexact, we have to rely on economic 
theory at times to make policy deci-
sions. In this case, we can see that 
minimum wages are destructive 
and discourage the hiring of low-
skilled workers, while having a neg-
ligible effect on overall employment. 
Though Mastricova’s argument is 
well intentioned, the studies he 
cites use incorrect metrics to gauge 
a reality that is ever changing. Eco-
nomic theory still holds. Raising the 
minimum wage only harms the low-
skilled workers it intends to help.

A PERSON’S OPINION
March 4, 2013 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A9
The Tartan is ready to relax. So we asked,
What are your plans for Spring Break?
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon and Kate Groschner
BRADEN KELNER
It’s time to look into where your 
university apparel comes from — 
at least if you own University of 
Pittsburgh-branded clothing.
Pitt students are uniting to en-
courage their university to af?liate 
with the Worker Rights Consortium 
(WRC), an independent organiza-
tion founded by students, university 
administrators, and labor rights ex-
perts that aims to end labor abuses 
and to defend workplace rights in 
factories, particularly in sweatshops 
that produce university apparel.
Duquesne University, Chatham 
University, and Carnegie Mellon 
are among the 180 organizations al-
ready af?liated with the WRC.
While Pitt has the right to not af-
?liate with the WRC, the university’s 
response — or lack thereof — is un-
acceptable.
Joe Thomas, founder of Pitt’s 
chapter of Americans for Informed 
Democracy, delivered multiple let-
ters to Chancellor Mark Nordenberg 
last fall asking for Pitt to af?liate 
with the WRC. During a meeting 
with Vice Provost and Dean of Stu-
dents Kathy Humphrey and Vice 
Chancellor G. Reynolds Clark, 
Thomas said the of?cials “didn’t see 
the point of joining” the WRC and 
questioned students’ motivations.
While of?cials representing the 
university met with students and at-
tended student-run events related 
to sweatshops, their responses do 
not indicate that they have seri-
ously considered the notion of af-
?liating with the WRC. The lack of 
interest by Pitt of?cials also shows a 
lack of respect for student concerns. 
Students drive sales when they pur-
chase university apparel, and their 
voices should be heard.
The university must respond 
promptly to student outcries and 
stop pushing aside the notion of af-
?liating with the WRC. While they 
may decline partnering with the 
WRC, they must at least provide 
a supported argument for their 
choice. Is it the cost of af?liation, 
which can be up to $50,000? Is it a 
disagreement with the WRC’s mis-
sion? Is it a question of whether or 
not the WRC will help Pitt ensure 
that its apparel comes from factories 
that promote workplace rights?
Admittedly, Pitt Senior Associate 
Director of News John Fedele wrote 
in an email to The Pitt News that Pitt 
was already “satis?ed with the [Fair 
Labor Association] and its work in 
this area,” referring to the organiza-
tion af?liated with the university. 
However, this claim is vague and 
needs to be supported by speci?c 
reasons why the university trusts 
the Fair Labor Association, which 
students and labor rights activists 
claim receives funds from the facto-
ries it inspects.
When asked by the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, WRC executive di-
rector Scott Nova claimed that the 
university had not contacted the 
organization. Given the rising stu-
dent outcry, one would think that, 
at the very least, Pitt would contact 
the WRC to discuss the possibility of 
af?liation.
The lack of action by the univer-
sity should not go unnoticed. Stu-
dents look up to their universities as 
bodies that have the power to pro-
mote change. They rely on that body 
to foster their ideas and help them 
meet their goals. When the univer-
sity’s vision is not in line with the 
vision of the students, it is the uni-
versity’s responsibility to thoroughly 
look into the matter before ignoring 
a proposed change.
It is not Pitt’s choice to remain 
unaf?liated with the WRC that both-
ers me — it’s the university’s lack of 
response, apparent disinterest, and 
absence of public research.

Pitt should be sweating over student concerns
It is not Pitt’s 
choice to remain 
unaf?liated with 
the WRC that 
bothers me — it’s 
the university’s 
lack of response.

The Oscars is always an interest-
ing event. Glittering jewelry, gor-
geous dresses, actors and actresses 
being witty with one another, all at 
an event that has been run and de-
cided by heterosexual white men for 
years. This year we were graced with 
Seth MacFarlane’s offensive jokes 
and blatant sexism as well.
Blatant sexism should never be 
allowed, especially from or toward 
the celebrity audience present at the 
Oscars.
Anne Hathaway hasn’t had a 
great year when it comes to the me-
dia; however, when it comes to just 
about everything else, she’s been 
ridiculously successful, as anyone 
who’s seen Les Mis can attest. From 
having a picture of her not wearing 
underwear circulating around the 
Internet, to appearing at the Oscars 
in a “nipple dress,” the media has 
shamed her for just about every-
thing, even in debates over whether 
or not her Oscar acceptance speech 
was “over-rehearsed.”
She is not taking this passively. 
When asked about the “lesson” she 
learned from the picture circulated 
on the Internet during an interview 
that was supposed to be about Les 
Mis, she turned it back around and 
said that she was “very sad that we 
live in an age when someone takes 
a picture of another person in a vul-
nerable moment and, rather than 
delete it, sells it.” You go, Anne! Four 
for you.
On the night of the Oscars, the 
Internet exploded with the Twitter 
trend “Les Nipperables,” a joke about 
how Hathaway’s nipples were show-
ing through her dress. 
Forgoing the fact that the “nip-
ples” were just the seams of her 
dress, and forgoing the fact that 
people have nipples, the ability of 
our culture to take away Hathaway’s 
entire night, including her Oscar and 
accomplishments, to make fun of 
her “wardrobe malfunction” is proof 
enough to me that sexism is wholly 
prevalent in our society.
By choosing to focus on that sin-
gular part of her, we are reducing 
her to her nipples. We are telling her, 
“Yes, you are allowed to be success-
ful. Yes, you are allowed to win an 
Oscar. But we’re still going to shame 
you for something this trivial, for es-
sentially nothing more than being a 
woman.” 
Seth MacFarlane’s song at the be-
ginning of the Oscars, entitled “We 
Saw Your Boobs,” supports this sen-
timent. The song was a list of every 
actress’s boobs that have been seen 
on the big screen. It’s not about how 
well they acted the scenes anymore. 
It’s about shaming them for exposing 
their breasts to the public. It’s about 
shaming them for thinking of their 
body as their own, something they 
can willingly choose to expose to 
whomever they want.
In her acceptance speech, Hatha-
way said, “Here’s hoping that some-
day in the not-too-distant future the 
misfortunes of Fantine will only be 
found in stories and nevermore in 
real life.”
I agree, Anne. But I think we’ve 
got a ways to go.

Sexism toward actresses is wrong

There has been recent contro-
versy over “Lil’ Poopy,” 9-year-old 
rapper Luie Rivera Jr. from Mas-
sachusetts, due to the nature of the 
YouTube videos in which he stars.
In these videos, Lil’ Poopy refer-
ences all the staples of the rap genre 
— money, drugs, and women. The 
particular video that garnered the 
attention of state child welfare of?-
cials, however, is most controversial 
because the fourth grader is seen 
slapping a woman on her rear end.
Before we get into any discus-
sion of the ethics of Lil’ Poopy’s vid-
eos, I would like to make one thing 
clear: Lil’ Poopy is a terrible rapper. 
Although it may seem a mean thing 
to say about a 9-year-old, I think it’s 
important to establish that the boy is 
not some Mozart-esque child prodi-
gy that the world would greatly suf-
fer without.
If he had been, it would make my 
position more defensible: This child 
should not be taken away from his 
parents and the videos themselves 
do not warrant an investigation.
While I morally object to what 
the parents are exposing their child 
to, removing a child from his or her 
family should only be reserved for 
extreme cases of child abuse and 
neglect.
Every family has had instances of 
questionable parenting that society 
would frown upon. However, re-
moving children from their families 
will always leave deep, long-term 
emotional damage. The question 
is whether or not the actions of the 
family harm a child so deeply that 
removing the child from the family is 
necessary.
At this point, there is no real evi-
dence of abuse that would warrant 
removing the child from his home. 
If the investigation uncovers actual 
instances of physical or emotional 
abuse, then I would certainly sup-
port the removal of the child from his 
family. However, the videos them-
selves are merely distasteful, not evi-
dence of severe abuse.
As for the video in which Lil’ 
Poopy is depicted slapping the wom-
an, it’s important to remember that 
Natalie Portman, Jodie Foster, and 
Brooke Shields were all featured in 
?lms where they played very sexu-
ally suggestive roles at a young age. 
Their parents were not investigated 
for abuse and neglect. Furthermore, 
child pageant parents are not inves-
tigated when their children wear 
overtly sexual clothing on stage. 
What is it about this case that is dras-
tically different?
Perhaps it is the association with 
hip-hop, and especially rap, with ex-
plicitly adult themes that makes this 
case so ?agrant. 
However, the decision to remove 
a child from his or her family should 
not be a decision based on cultural 
stereotypes; instead, the decision 
should be based off of a careful anal-
ysis of evidence as to whether or not 
there is actual abuse going on in a 
household.
While I hate the fact that par-
ents would think it appropriate for 
a 9-year-old to rap about drugs and 
sex, it would be worse if child servic-
es removed children from their par-
ents simply because of distaste over 
the parenting style that they exhibit.

This week was an interest-
ing one for Pittsburgh sports 
fans. The Penguins are suc-
ceeding even with some injury 
issues, the Pirates are starting 
spring training, and the Steel-
ers are setting themselves up 
for what will likely be a very 
busy off-season.
While this may be a slow 
time in terms of Pittsburgh 
sports, things are about to heat 
up with the NHL Playoffs, the 
start of the MLB regular sea-
son, and the NFL draft all on 
the horizon. Hopefully each 
team makes the right moves 
now to put themselves in a po-
sition to win when it counts.
Hockey
It seems like déjà vu for 
Penguins fans. As we near the 
halfway point of this short-
ened season, yet another of 
the Pittsburgh superstars has 
gone down with a concussion. 
The only difference is that 
this time it is Evgeni Malkin, 
not Sidney Crosby, who is out 
for an indeterminate time pe-
riod.
Malkin was injured last Fri-
day against the Florida Pan-
thers, after taking a brutal hit 
from Panthers defenseman 
Erik Gudbranson. 
Malkin was skating in Flor-
ida territory with the puck, 
hoping to break a 1 –1 tie in 
the third period, when Gud-
branson checked Malkin to the 
ground causing him to slide 
on the ice and slam his head 
against the boards.
He was immediately re-
moved from the game due to 
severe headaches, mild disori-
entation, and other early con-
cussion symptoms. 
The play itself was a clean 
hit, but the real damage was 
done when Malkin’s head and 
neck whiplashed when he hit 
the boards.
The glimmer of hope for 
Pens fans was the speed with 
which Malkin has returned to 
the ice. 
Wednesday, Malkin skated 
around for 30 minutes during 
practice, but he still has a ways 
to go before he can play again. 
It is also important to re-
member the varied progress 
Crosby had in the nearly two 
years he spent trying to recov-
er from his own concussion.
Thankfully, the Penguins 
are still in an easy position to 
make the playoffs with Crosby 
?nally returning to his domi-
nating form after two years off 
due to concussions. 
Goalie Marc-André Fleury 
and the Pens’ defense is also 
doing its part, ranking in the 
middle of the league in points 
allowed.
When coupled with their 
second-rank offensive, their 
defense’s performance has led 
the team to second place in the 
NHL’s Eastern Conference.
Baseball
For the Pirates, this may 
?nally be the year that’s differ-
ent. On the back of all-star An-
drew McCutchen, third base-
man slugger Pedro Alvarez, 
major free-agent acquisition 
Russell Martin, and a rota-
tion that includes A.J. Burnett, 
Wandy Rodríguez, and James 
McDonald, the Pirates look to 
?nally end this season with a 
winning record for the ?rst 
time in 21 years.
The Pirates are still a year 
or two away from really mak-
ing some noise in the National 
League Central Division, but 
at least they are headed in the 
right direction.
The front of?ce has shown 
a commitment to winning by 
negotiating a big-money con-
tract extension for McCutchen 
and out-paying the New York 
Yankees for Martin’s catching 
services.
Starling Marte is a name to 
keep an eye on this year. 
He got called up from the 
minor leagues in July last year, 
and appears to be in position 
to win the starting left ?eld job 
out of spring training. 
At just 24 years old, he has 
plenty of room to grow but has 
some good power and great 
spee
Football
After last season’s crazy 
off-season with the team ?r-
ing offensive coordinator 
Bruce Arians, who went on to 
win coach-of-the-year honors 
with the Indianapolis Colts, 
the Steelers missed the play-
offs and barely had a winning 
record.
This off-season is setting 
up to be just as hectic, with the 
Steelers trying to get younger 
players on defense while also 
trying to get under the salary 
cap.
So far the Steelers have re-
negotiated quarterback Ben 
Roethlisberger’s contract, but 
have pretty much given up all 
hope of signing free agent re-
ceiver Mike Wallace again.
The Steelers have bet-
ter draft picks than in recent 
years — the 17th pick in the 
?rst round — due to their poor 
regular season performance. 
This could be used either to 
continue ?xing their aging 
and porous offensive line or 
to rejuvenate the slowing de-
fense.

Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team ?n-
ished its season at the Eastern 
College Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) South Championship 
last Wednesday with a 94–80 
loss to the Juniata College Ea-
gles (19–8). This was the ?rst 
time the Tartans have made 
it to the championships since 
the 1999–2000 season, and 
marking an end to the ?rst 
winning season in 10 years. 
The Tartans’ ?nal in-season 
record was 13–12.
In the week prior to the 
ECAC Southern Champion-
ship, the Tartans suffered 
losses at Case Western Re-
serve University and Emory 
University. But these losses 
were hard-fought battles. At 
the Feb. 23 game against Case 
Western, the Tartans had a 
22–10 run in the ?rst half, 
with senior Emily Peel lead-
ing with a high shooting per-
centage.
This is typical of Peel, who 
?nished the 2013 regular-
season campaign averaging 
13.9 points and 8.2 rebounds 
per game. She also posted 30 
blocks for an average of 1.2 a 
game to lead the team in all 
four categories.
Peel closed the regular sea-
son with a national ranking of 
eight in ?eld-goal percentage, 
shooting at a 56.6 percent 
clip. With the ?rst-team selec-
tion, Peel becomes the fourth 
Tartan to earn two or more 
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) ?rst-team honors.
Peel was also a great as-
set for the Tartans, shooting a 
season-high 27 points. She is 
currently the fourth leading 
scorer in school history with 
1,203 points and the seventh 
leading rebounder with 721 
points.
“This season was awe-
some. To have the ?rst win-
ning season in a decade and to 
make it to ECAC’s was amaz-
ing. We have come a long way 
and this is only the beginning 
of the success I know the 
team will have,” Peel said. “It 
has been great to be a part of 
the CMU women’s baskeball 
program and I have really en-
joyed getting to know such an 
awesome group of people.”
Following their loss at Case 
Western, the Tartans head-
ed to Juniata and the ECAC 
South Championship last 
Wednesday. Juniata started 
off strong and gained a 14–0 
lead in the ?rst three minutes, 
continuing their dominance 
with the biggest lead of the 
half with a score of 28–9. 
Eagle junior Jordan Hileman 
was a major player, earning 
the majority of the points for 
the opposing team in this half.
The Tartans fought back 
to reduce the de?cit to seven 
points with four minutes left 
in the ?rst half. 
First-year Lindsay Poss 
stepped up for the Tartans 
and shot a three-pointer and 
two baskets in a row to make 
the score 39–32 in Carnegie 
Mellon’s favor.
At the break, Peel had 
scored 15 points and Poss 
scored 11, while senior Jor-
dan Speck dominated for the 
Eagles with 19 points.Speck 
made the last three-pointer of 
the game, giving the Eagles a 
57–42 lead over the Tartans. 
They continued their 
shooting streak with a 48 per-
cent average for the second 
half, leading to the ?nal score 
94–80 in the Eagles’ favor. 
The Eagles only made one 
more shot than the Tartans, 
but they made more many 
more three-pointers than did 
the Tartans.
Poss made a career-best 
?nish, a total of 20 points.
First-year Liza Otto also 
received honors as by making 
the UAA second-team, becom-
ing the ?rst Tartan ?rst-year 
to make the second-team 
since the 2008–09 season.
Otto was third on the team 
in scoring with 10.3 points 
per game, and second on the 
team in rebounding with 8.0 
boards a game. Otto led the 
team in assists with 72, which 
averaged out to 2.9 assists a 
game, and led the team with 
double-digit rebounds in nine 
games.
Overall, the Tartans do 
not dwell on their loss in the 
championship, but rather 
look at the successful season 
with feelings of accomplish-
ment. These feelings of pride 
and achievement are espe-
cially strong for the graduat-
ing seniors.
“It’s very strange to think 
‘Wow, these four years are 
over,’ ” senior Tori Baggio 
said. “But I really enjoyed this 
season and think we accom-
plished a lot. We have a great 
group of girls, and I’m excited 
to come back as an alum to see 
them do even greater things.”

Women’s tennis advances to 
?nal ITA round, loses 5–4
ABBY SMITH
Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s tennis team traveled 
to Greencastle, Ind. this week-
end and advanced to the ?nal 
match of the International 
Tennis Association (ITA)’s In-
door Championship, where 
the team suffered a tough 5–4 
loss to the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity Blue Jays. 
Their advancement to the 
?nal rounds of competition 
on Sunday was not a novelty 
for the ?fth-ranked Tartans, 
who won the inaugural cham-
pionship in 2009 and were 
runners-up in 2011.
The Tartans immediately 
established their competitive-
ness and dominance in the 
competition, ?rst advancing 
to the semi?nals on Friday. 
The Tartans started the 
match with a sweeping dou-
ble play. 
Senior Alex Tapak and 
?rst-year Brooke Tsu opened 
with an 8–1 win at No. 3 dou-
bles. 
Junior Katie Cecil and 
sophomore Angela Pratt dou-
bled up to claim the Tartans 
second point with an 8–4 win 
at No. 1, followed by a 8–3 
doubles win by sophomores 
Bryn Raschke and Chelsea 
Motie.
“The doubles did an excel-
lent job this weekend,” Pratt 
said. “I look forward to more 
of the spring season.”
In singles play, Cecil and 
Motie won in straight sets at 
No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, 
to seal Tartan victories. 
The Tartans also claimed 
victories at No. 4, No. 5, and 
No. 6 singles. Pratt won 6–1, 
6–1 at No. 4 while Tsu won 
6–4, 6–1 at No. 4, and Tapak 
won 4–6, 6–1, 10–5 at No. 6.
On Saturday the Tartans 
came away with an 8–1 vic-
tory over the Trinity Univer-
sity Tigers to advance to the 
national ?nal match for the 
second consecutive year. 
The lineup was similar to 
the previous day and featured 
wins by pairs Raschke and 
Motie in addition to Cecil and 
Pratt. 
Motie and Cecil also won 
their singles matches, while 
?rst-year Elizabeth Martin 
sealed the match for Carnegie 
Mellon with a win inthe No. 3 
singles.
Success did not stop there 
for the team, as Tsu and ?rst-
year Abbey Hamstra capped 
off the night with singles 
wins as well, marking the ?fth 
straight set with a total of six 
singles wins for Carnegie Mel-
lon.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
started strong with two wins 
in doubles: an 8–2 win by Ra-
schke and Motie and an 8–5 
win by Cecil and Pratt. 
The team was ahead 2–1 
going into singles play, but 
unfortunately, the Tartans did 
not fare as well in the singles 
part of Sunday’s competition.
 Ultimately, the two singles 
wins by Motie and Cecil were 
not enough to carry the Tar-
tans.
Despite their ?nal losses 
in the singles matches, the 
Tartans were still proud of 
their overall performance 
and thankful for the time to 
bond together during the long 
weekend. 
“I had an awesome time 
this weekend,” Tsu said. “Es-
pecially listening to Justin 
Bieber with my teammates.”
The Tartans and the Johns 
Hopkin’s Blue Jays will meet 
again on March 31, when 
Carnegie Mellon will travel to 
Johns Hopkins for a 12 p.m. 
match.

First-year Brooke Tsu was a major asset in the doubles play during the ITA Championship this weekend. 
ATHLETE PROFILENo one leads men’s club volleyball team quite like Gaston
VINAY VISWANATHAN
Staffwriter
Senior mechanical engineering major Tay-
lor Gaston has been part of the men’s club vol-
leyball team since his ?rst year and is hoping 
to wrap up his illustrious volleyball career at 
Carnegie Mellon on a high note.
Gaston has been a standout outside hitter 
and captain on the club for four years, and has 
also been heavily involved as the manager of 
the varsity women’s volleyball team.
The Harrisburg, Pa. native says that “[the 
team has] gone through a rebuilding phase, 
but we’ve gotten a lot of younger guys as the 
team has progressed.”
Gaston has excelled in his position as a 
captain. First-year Daniel Lee said, “Taylor 
has been a really strong captain because he’s 
a role model who leads by setting an example, 
both on and off the court.” Lee added, “He’s 
incredibly supportive and consistently look-
ing for ways to improve your play.”
Entering the season, Gaston hoped that 
“we would get out of the rebuilding phase and 
that we would be more strict, committed, and 
involved.” 
In Gaston’s eyes, much of this initial goal 
for the season has been accomplished. The 
team is 4-3 this season, with a ?nal win in two 
games against Robert Morris University. 
The men’s volleyball team is in the Penn-
Ohio Volleyball League (POVL), competing 
against local teams including the club team 
from the University of Pittsburgh.
The team has nevertheless faced countless 
challenges this year, with the most pressing 
being less-than-desired levels of involvement 
from the players. Gaston said that it is “hard 
for us to get as much participation and com-
mitment as we’d like due to demand in other 
areas of life, especially academically.” The 
team practices twice a week, and often travels 
to other schools for matches.
Still, Gaston boasts that the team, led by 
coach and assistant professor of chemistry 
Kevin J. Noonan, is “better than it has been 
during the past two years.”
Sophomore teammate DJ Begos said, 
“[Gaston’s] always getting us excited on the 
court, and he’s just a leader. He always helps 
at practice and tells us things to work on. Him, 
[team president Alex Campbell], and our 
coach all help, and are really good leaders.”
Outside of the court, Gaston said that he 
simply enjoys  hanging out with friends and 
playing other sports. I also really like to eat 
and try out different restaurants.” Being a 
Pennsylvania native, Gaston also enjoys trav-
elling to other schools and exploring other 
academic institutions. 
After graduation, Gaston plans to enter 
the work force as a mechanical engineer.
He is also an active participant in the uni-
versity intramural sports leagues, engineer-
ing groups on campus, and is a brother of 
the Pennsylvania Rho chapter of Phi Kappa 
Theta.
Gaston uses volleyball as a break from 
the challenging engineering course-
work and the busy college lifestyle. 
“It was at ?rst hard to juggle aca-
demics and athletics, but there’s de?-
nitely time to get work done,” Gaston 
said. “When there are only a few things 
that you like to do other than hanging 
out with friends, [volleyball] is de?nitely 
a great outlet from the stress.”
Even before coming to Carnegie Mellon, 
Gaston was in correspondence with the presi-
dent of the volleyball team, and quickly be-
came integrated into the team environment. 
Based on his experience in joining the 
team, Gaston encourages any students who 
are unsure of joining a group like the volley-
ball team to “take that ?rst step and be outgo-
ing; you will de?nitely be accepted with open 
arms.”
“Taylor’s been our vice president for the 
past two years, and he’s also been our on-the-
?oor captain,” team president Alex Campbell 
said. “He’s the spirit of our team. He’s the one 
who always gets people motivated and gives 
speeches, and gets us up when we’re down. 
He’s very vocal and really excited all the time, 
which is great to have on the team and great 
for a captain to be.”
“When there are only 
a few things that you 
like to do other than 
hanging out with 
friends, [volleyball] is 
de?nitely a great outlet 
from the stress.”

High energy, laughs galore
Comedian/writer Buress presents memorable, exciting show
“Why don’t we eat penguins?”
It’s a question that is not often asked, but one that 
comedian Hannibal Buress asked nonetheless at a 
performance last week at Mr. Small’s Theatre, where 
he claimed he would pay $500 to wrangle a penguin 
and eat it.
Buress is a Chicago-based comedian who has 
written for Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock. He has 
also been featured on Comedy Central programs and 
has appeared on various talk shows, including the 
Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with 
Jimmy Fallon, and The Late Late Show with Craig 
Ferguson.
Mr. Small’s Theatre, where the show was held, was 
a very colorful venue. Converted from a church into 
a performance space, the theater has an interesting 
atmosphere and interior, although there was not 
enough seating for a comedy show. The venue is 
usually used for concerts and musical performances, 
which was clear from the fact that nearly all the seats 
were folding chairs.
The show started off with a bang. Buress came 
in after a grand introduction and ran around the 
theater, mingling with the crowd. Through most of 
the hour-long set, he was able to maintain that high 
level of energy.
The show, mostly composed of observational and 
absurdist humor, seemed rather experimental. 
Buress’ conversationalist, off-the-cuff delivery is very 
sharp and adds greatly to his jokes. Some memorable 
moments include jokes about Mitt Romney’s 
proposed changes to the TSA, Will Smith’s death, 
the practice of podiatry, domestic violence in the 
context of Kobe Bryant’s career, and Buress himself 
being the victim of a failed robbery.
Another memorable joke involved Buress’ trip to the 
emergency room after a car accident: He describes 
a nurse who chastises him for cursing in the 
emergency room. “What? Does my cursing ruin the 
emergency room experience of the other patients?” 
he asked.
Although the variety of the subject matter kept the 
audience interested, some of his jokes could have 
been more connected by a narrative. For instance, 
Buress made plenty of jokes about his experiences in 
London, but they were far too spread out.
Another less-than-satisfactory part of the show 
occurred when Buress riffed on ridiculous rap lyrics. 
The particular jokes he made, like those about Big 
Sean’s lyrics in the Kanye West song “Mercy,” were 
not very insightful or original. Where Buress did 
make original commentary about certain lyrics, 
however, he redeemed himself somewhat.
An interesting aspect of the performance was that, 
unlike many stand-up performances, this was not a 
one-man show. Buress had a DJ accompany him as 
part of the show, playing music where appropriate. 
At the end, Buress also had ballerinas and someone 
dressed in an Elmo costume dancing with him on 
stage.
Buress’s comedy is pretty original, and he is very 
talented as a comedian. For anyone interested 
in stand-up comedy, it’s an act definitely worth 
checking out.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
Spring break’s coming up, 
and I’m going on a road 
trip with some friends. I’m 
a little concerned about it, 
though. How can I make 
sure our road trip goes 
well?
Thanks,
Hoping Imminent Trip 
Triumphs, Helplessly 
En Route On Arduous 
Diversions
Dear HIT THE ROAD,
Lucky for you, I’m a 
connoisseur of road trip 
films. I’ve seen ’em all. I 
know all the tricks. First 
things first: The point of 
road trips is to engage in 
multistate shenanigans 
predicated upon simple 
misunderstandings, like 
pretending to be in a 
historically black fraternity or 
holding an amusement park 
hostage with a BB gun.
While your shenanigans may 
not be as great as those, 
you should still engage 
in as many as you can. 
That means doing things 
like pulling over for every 
“World’s Largest ______” 
you pass, going to biker 
bars while cross-dressing 
for convoluted reasons, and 
reassembling your car with 
duct tape. Sure, it won’t be 
the same as traveling with 
Kristen Stewart in On The 
Road, but at least you’ll be 
able to make eye contact 
with your friend afterwards.
Just be glad you’re not 
traveling with David 
Spade,

Dear Patrick,
How can I explain to 
someone that I don’t want 
to be in a relationship 
right now? Everyone 
assumes that since I’m 
a girl, that’s what I want, 
but I really just want to 
hang out with my friends 
and maybe hook up with 
a cute dude. 
Thanks,

Dear JAUNTY JEZEBEL,
Have you tried just telling 
him you don’t want a 
relationship? I think he’ll still 
understand. If he still thinks 
you want a relationship, then 
there’s not much you can 
say to explain it to him. The 
best way to convince him 
you don’t want to date him 
is to just not date him.
At this point, the question 
becomes “How do I end my 
casual hookup?” You could 
go with the tried-and-true 
method of ignoring his texts 
and avoiding him until he 
gets the idea (of course, 
that makes you look like a 
jerk). Or just maintain polite 
conversation but come up 
with excuses for avoiding 
him (and be slightly less of a 
jerk). Or have an actual adult 
conversation — crazy, right?
Or just don’t give him 
your number,
Patrick Hoskins

Entering the Andy Warhol Museum is like entering 
a strange, neon-colored land. The giant Brillo box 
statue across from the entrance and the neon purple 
and yellow cows printed on the walls are signs of the 
eccentric work that is to come.
The museum currently features a special exhibit 
called Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years, 
which celebrates the 50th anniversary of Warhol’s 
“Campbell’s Soup Cans.” The exhibit, which opened 
Feb. 3, showcases some of the most in?uential work 
Andy Warhol ever made — think of the Marilyn 
Monroe silkscreen images and the Elvis Presley 
prints — as well as work from other artists that have 
emulated Warhol since his legendary art rocked the 
world.
Each ?oor of the museum has huge photos of Andy 
Warhol, along with famous quotes that exemplify his 
character. The last ?oor of the museum, part of the 
permanent collection, is dedicated to Andy Warhol’s 
life and features his diploma from Carnegie Mellon 
— a nice link between the past and the present. It 
is fascinating to go through all the ?oors and see 
different facets of Andy Warhol and the people he 
inspired, albeit a little repetitive at points.
The new exhibit begins on the seventh ?oor and is 
also installed in ?oors ?ve, four, and two. As soon as 
visitors step into the gallery, they are greeted with 
massive self-portraits of Andy Warhol. Featuring 
his iconic silkscreen technique, the neon-colored 
canvases are a strong opening statement to the 
exhibit. Continuing into the gallery, there are several 
standout pieces, but these are hidden amidst the 
other pieces that honestly fail to spur excitement. 
Some of the pieces are just confusing. Although it 
is modern contemporary art, it is hard to see the 
artistic value or talent behind it.
One of the knockout pieces, an untitled work by 
Félix González-Torres, is a huge pile of candy on 
the ground, placed in a corner of one of the rooms. 
It seems very simple at ?rst — until the description 
explains that the candy’s weight totals 175 pounds: 
the weight of González-Torres’s lover, who died of 
AIDS. According to the description, the candy is a 
representation of the perfect sweetness between 
Torres and his lover. As people walk by the exhibit 
and take pieces of candy — as they are encouraged 
to do — they are symbolically re-enacting the 
diminishing effect AIDS had on the artist’s lover. 
But they are also adding to his lover’s reincarnation 
when the museum replenishes the candy supply to 
its original 175-pound weight.
Other interesting pieces include a silkscreen print 
splattered with dark, white, and milk chocolate 
(“Black Star Black Press: Black Star, Black Press, 
Star” by Kelley Walker) and a giant box of cigarettes 
(“Helmsboro Country” by Hans Haacke). Of course, 
the museum also features Andy Warhol’s famous 
pieces like his Brillo boxes and his screen prints 
of famous celebrities. Different artists that were 
inspired by Warhol are featured as well, through 
videos, photographs, installation pieces, and screen 
prints.
The Andy Warhol Museum is a good place to visit if 
modern art interests you, especially since it’s free for 
Carnegie Mellon students. After all, Warhol is such 
an important part of Pittsburgh culture. Though I 
wouldn’t recommend visiting the museum multiple 
times, a trip to see the Regarding Warhol exhibit is 
de?nitely worth your time.

Voice majors leave audience in stitches 
Sophomore Convocation organizes classic songs into hilariously original musical
Kresge Theatre was ?lled with uproarious laughter 
last Thursday at a production written and produced 
by the School of Music sophomore vocal performance 
class, The Curious Murder of a Person Not Particularly 
Liked. Convocation is a requirement for all students in 
the School fo Music, but instead of a standard formal 
performance of one solo after another, the students 
comically arranged classic songs into a musical that 
swept the crowd away. Every scene had its own unique 
and standout character.
The story follows the mysterious death of an abhorred 
hotel owner and manager, Rick Felicino (played by 
Grant Braider). Detective Geoffrey Hansen (Ethan 
Crystal) leads an investigation into Rick’s death and the 
quirky community that surrounded him, which bridges 
into a series of hysterical character studies. The show 
concludes with the reveal of the villain’s identity, which 
comes as a huge surprise to both the audience and the 
characters on stage.
The performance kicked off with a Beauty and the Beast 
favorite, “Be Our Guest,” which welcomed the highly 
engaged audience and also invited the enthusiastic cast 
to the stage. The hype of the ?rst number was followed 
by “Master of the House” — recently revived by the ?lm 
adaptation of Les Misérables — which introduced the 
community and the situation. One by one, each student 
showcased his or her solo piece, often accompanied in 
harmony by the other actors.
The hilarious incorporation of Carnegie Mellon School 
of Music inside jokes into the lyrics made each piece 
relatable to many of the students in attendance. Jokes 
included references to eurhythmics class, the BXA 
program, and the question, “Did you shower?” Waves of 
laughter came one after another.
Joel Goodloe’s performance of “Memory” elicited even 
more laughter when Goodloe unexpectedly broke into 
a joyous tap dance in the middle of this all-time classic, 
prompting another wave of cheers. The captivating 
performances continued with John Teresi’s performance 
of Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” in 
which he dramatically acted out a rebellious teenager 
pursuing his passion of music despite the challenges he 
encounters.
Joanna Latini, Stephanie Ramos, and Campbell Rogers 
each embodied strong and distinctive characters 
through pieces with modi?ed lyrics; their performances, 
in particular, were hysterical. Ramos’ rendition of 
“Contigo en la Distancia” (accompanied by Braider on 
acoustic guitar) was in Spanish, and though the majority 
of the audience could not speak or understand the 
language, Ramos’ synchronized voice, facial expression, 
and body movements were alluring.
After a few more entertaining vocal performances — 
including Patrick Coniway’s “Mad World” and a joint 
song by Adrienne Lotto and Bridget McCoy  — the 
villain turned out to be the students’ vocal coach and 
the pianist of the night, Roseanna Irwin. This revelation 
brightened the afternoon: It was heartwarming to see a 
teacher singing with her fellow students.
Though it included a lot of classic oldies, the show was 
overall very up to date. It vibrantly and humorously 
examined today’s culture through its portrayal of 
different racial and gender stereotypes. Carnegie 
Mellon’s sophomore vocal performance class is ?lled 
with not just musical and acting talent, but also a lot of 
originality.
If all this is not reaped from hard work, I’m not sure what 
is. Whoever believes the program’s claim that “all voice 
majors do is complain but never do anything” must 
somehow be delirious.

The sophomore vocal performance class put on a

The mood was set from the moment the audience 
entered the studio space: stark staging with harsh 
geometric lighting patterns, the spicy incense ?oating 
through the air, and an actor laying in the dust on the 
stage, twitching and writhing every few moments.
During the School of Drama’s Thursday night 
performance of DYO (or Please Take Care of Me), the 
meaning of life was questioned, fate was twisted, and 
caution was thrown to the winds of chance. The play, 
which ran for a little over an hour, was based on a 
variety of writings by Japanese author Haruki Murakami 
adapted by senior drama major Tegan McDuf?e, who 
also directed the production.
Every part of the set and each costume served a purpose, 
even if it was a small, seemingly inconsequential one. 
Little touches, such as spraying fruity scents into the air 
to evoke the free winds of summer, only served to make 
the play more dreamlike and deliciously ambiguous. 
The massive amount of attention that this must have 
required from the crew and designers is impressive and 
admirable.
DYO (or Please Take Care of Me) was completely 
immersive in its nature, making for a thought-
provoking, mystical experience. The story lines were 
disjointed, seemingly running along parallel lines and 
then intersecting haphazardly before returning to their 
respective planes. Because the story was compiled from 
13 of Murakami’s works, the plot was grounded heavily 
in thematic material and characters. According to the 
program notes — written by the show’s dramaturgist, 
junior Bachelor of Humanities and Art student Emily 
Anne Gibson — the director and editors sifted through 
the works to synthesize common themes, motifs, and 
archetypes.
The result was a play that is unexpectedly deep and 
poignant, featuring six characters: He (junior acting 
major John Garet Stoker), She (senior dramaturgy major 
Olivia O’Connor), The Rat (junior acting and musical 
theatre double major Chris Douglass), May (junior acting 
major Bridget Peterson), The Sheep Man (junior theatre 
studies major Josh Buckwald), and The Man With No 
Face (also played by Buckwald).
Filled with intricate metaphors, metasymbolic 
references, and countless moments of surreal honesty, 
DYO (or Please Take Care of Me) examines the reality 
of life and the prices that come with reaching beyond 
it. While somewhat puzzling, an idea was presented 
early in the play that seemed to explain the bewildering 
stories and themes: Sometimes, not understanding 
something is simply how one understands it.
The cast that supported the incredibly abstract script 
was more than capable of communicating these 
intangible concepts. Peterson’s May was bubbly, sweet, 
and a true force of nature. She not only came off as 
startlingly real, but also made it easy for the audience 
to laugh a little in the middle of such a philosophical 
labyrinth. It was easy to see the viewpoint and 
philosophy that she represented, and the way in which 
she embodied the whimsical naivety of youth while 
spouting the truest truths was positively angelic.
May’s humor was balanced by the adorably quirky He. 
Resigned to agree with the many people that label him 
as weird, Stoker’s character was con?icted, sweet, and 
totally lost, making for an easily accessible and very 
relatable protagonist.
The collection of eclectic characters sported a wardrobe 
that was practically a character of its own, considering 
how much of the story it told, and the staging was both 
simple and incredibly purposed.
With all of these elements blending together, a play 
that had the potential to crash and burn in ambiguity 
emerged as a whimsical, magical story that explored 
the fuzzy edges of reality, crafting an introspective 
experience for all.

DYO is both whimsical and philosophical 
School of Drama presents well-executed, surprisingly thought-provoking production
Apparat presents emotive new album
Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre) shows evolution toward emotionally rich sound
When announcing the release of Krieg und Frieden 
(Music for Theatre), German electronic musician 
Sascha Ring (also known as Apparat) described his 
newest album on his website: “It’s [my] ?rst record ever 
that didn’t hurt at some point. It’s full of imperfection 
because it was made by humans.”
It’s clear that the album was “made by humans”; it is 
so emotive that it could only be created by passionate 
individuals. But if there are imperfections, they are 
certainly dif?cult to ?nd.
Apparat mostly produces electronic music, but Krieg 
und Frieden (Music for Theatre) delves into the 
hypnotic magic of live performance and orchestral 
instrumentation. The music was originally composed 
for Krieg und Frieden, an experimental stage adaptation 
of Tolstoy’s War and Peace by German theater director 
Sebastian Hartmann at the Centraltheater Leipzig; Ring 
performed the music live with two string musicians, 
Christoph “Mäckie” Hamann and Philipp Thimm, during 
the play’s performances.
When Apparat ?rst started releasing music over 10 years 
ago, it was intelligent dance music (IDM) comprised of 
crisp electronic sounds. Over the years, though, Ring has 
slowly integrated more orchestration and vocals into his 
music; his 2011 album The Devil’s Walk featured lush, 
orchestral soundscapes mixed with his experimental 
electronics.
Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre) shows just how far 
Apparat has come since its early, purely electronic days: 
The album leans far more on orchestral instruments, 
ambient noise, and modern classical in?uences than on 
the beeps and boops prevalent in Ring’s early work. The 
result is emotionally rich music that’s so full of color that 
it’s easy to forget it was performed by only three people.
Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre) starts off simply, 
with slow, soulful harmonies from the strings. But 
eventually Ring’s electronic production creeps in, with 
small electronic sounds added here and there, eventually 
building into a noise interpretation of the strings’ simple 
melody.
This dark, ambient feel ebbs and ?ows throughout 
the album, with electronics, a piano, the strings, a 
xylophone, percussion, and Ring’s vocals all weaving 
in and out to create an emotionally complex tapestry of 
sound in which you can easily lose yourself. This is an 
album that deserves to be listened to with headphones, 
in full, without distractions, so that it can be fully 
appreciated.

Key room selection 2013 dates and deadlines
What’s New? 
Housing changes for the 2013 room selection process
Room selection application process
Housing and Dining Services has launched a new online portal application process in 
the hopes that Room Selection 2013 will be faster and more efficient. All eligible stu-
dents can participate in Room Selection for the 2013–14 academic year via the housing 
portal at http:/www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.
Room retention policies
Students wishing to retain their current rooms must fill all vacancies in their room, 
suite, or apartment through pull-ins. Students who retain but fail to fill vacan-
cies will be paired with other residents in half-filled rooms, meaning that said stu-
dents will either be assigned a new room or a new roommate who also failed to 
fill vacancies. The “Roommate Profile” section of the housing portal application at                             
https://web.campusservices.cmu.edu/housing/roommates/index.html can be used to 
find other students looking for roommates.
Housing rates
Housing rates for the 2013–14 academic year are expected to increase by 4–6 percent, 
depending on the location, with the reservation fee at $400 a year. Final rates are avail-
able on the Housing and Dining Room Retention website at  
http://www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection/forms/13-14rates.pdf. 
Individual room selection
Students participating in room selection as individuals can only select either a 
single room (if available) or an available space in a partially filled room or apartment.  
If no partially filled room options are available, the student can sign up for Open 
Assignment. Housing and Dining Services suggests that students participate in room 
selection with a roommate to ensure the widest range of room options available.
Potential changes for the 2013–14 academic year
•	The second floor of West Wing House may not be available for retention during 
next year’s room selection. 
•	Students with private or semiprivate bathrooms may be responsible for cleaning 
their own bathrooms starting at the beginning of the next academic year. 
•	Phone lines will continue to phase out in individual rooms of all residential 
buildings. Phone lines in building’s staff rooms and common areas will remain to 
be used for emergency purposes.

Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for 
the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available 
to most upperclass students, except those in special-interest housing, a first-year 
dormitory, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, 
regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember 
that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the 
open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies 
in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, 
students must be eligible to participate in room selection and must not have already 
selected an assignment for the 2013–14 school year.
General room selection
General room selection is the final phase of room selection. During this phase, students 
eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose a room 
from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general room selection 
must “elect to participate” by signing a housing license agreement. They are then 
given a random room selection number.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during 
the 2013–14 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in room 
selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection 
process carried out by the Office of Student Development.
Special-interest housing
Special-interest housing allows groups of students to apply for group housing centered 
around a certain interest or theme. Special-interest housing groups should consider 
how they plan to positively impact the larger residential community before completing 
the special-interest housing application process.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a “block” 
of apartments near each other in one of the apartment-style dormitories. Students 
electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who will be 
responsible for setting up their Block Housing group on the housing portal and will 
remain the main contact point between the group and Housing and Dining Services.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing is a program in the Oakland Community Apartments that 
permits upperclass residents of different genders to reside in the same room.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an 
open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2013–14 
academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or 
what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students 
wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their 
offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days 
without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.

Room selection phases explained
Terms and technicalities to guide you through the process
Room selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), general room selection, 
RA/CA housing, special-interest housing, block housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three room selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room selection. 
However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room selection begins on March 6, so all students returning next 
year should begin thinking about their housing plans for the 2013–14 school year.

FAIRFAX APARTMENTS
Located close to campus facilities, Doherty Apartments can be considered one of 
the best options for on-campus housing. It is a mere three-minute walk to the Resnik 
Café and 10 minutes from most classes. Doherty is a great option for students who 
wish to have their own kitchen in an autonomous apartment style of living.
Doherty is divided into four separate towers, each headed by its own RA, who 
provides his or her residents with the bare essentials: trash bags, paper towels, and, 
of course, toilet paper. Each tower consists of three ?oors and a basement.
As a community, there are weekly events to satisfy your sweet tooth and appropriate 
exercise programs to sweat off the following day’s regret. However, due primarily to 
the tower layout of the building, making friends in Doherty can be much more dif?cult 
than in other housing options. Most doors remain closed throughout the day, so 
the occasional meet-and-greet as you leave the building is often the only interaction 
between residents.
Doherty Apartments provides air-conditioning in its exercise room; however, that 
is the only room in the building that is equipped with it. Most residents purchase 
personal air-conditioning units during hot weather. Make sure to take them out during 
the winter, as Doherty’s weak heaters force residents to cling to every bit of warmth 
that they can.
Rooms provide just the right mix of privacy and integration with your roommates. The 
one-bedroom triples include a bedroom for the three beds, a bathroom, and a living 
room with a kitchenette. The living room also has three study desks, a dining table, a 
couch, and a small loveseat. Two-person ef?ciencies are similar, though everything is 
located in a single room without some of the furniture.
In general, Doherty Apartments provides a decently sized living area for those who 
seek autonomy in college life.
The community in Fairfax Apartments is not as strong as in on-campus dorms 
like Morewood, because each ?oor is home to a mix of Carnegie Mellon and 
non-Carnegie Mellon residents. Despite this, Fairfax is the perfect transition for 
upperclassmen to living in off-campus housing. Once acquainted with back-alley 
shortcuts, it’s a quick 10-to-15-minute walk to campus, and the building’s proximity 
to Craig Street, which houses many restaurants that are open late at night, make it 
appealing to many college students. 
Inside the individual apartments, every room is carpeted, except for the kitchen and 
bathroom, which have tiling. The walls, conveniently, are solid — a welcome change 
from the paper-thin dividers that separate rooms in some on-campus housing. Fairfax 
is also relatively quiet, although every now and then, a group of happy, shouting 
people may break the silence. The rooms are furnished and come prepared with 
beds, tables, and drawers, and the kitchen has a stove and refrigerator. Some units 
even have dishwashers. Air-conditioning and heating are included as well.
Bus stops for the 54C, 71 series, and 75 are also located close to the building’s 
doors. Pittsburgh is on your doorstep if you live in Fairfax.
Laundry payment may be the largest problem students have with Fairfax. Doing 
laundry requires that students ?rst buy a $5 card to pay for the machines. The card 
does not actually come with $5; students must put in money manually, and the 
machine accepts only bills. In addition, Fairfax’s internet connection is not Carnegie 
Mellon internet, but rather Comcast. Finally, the cost of living is one of the highest 
at Carnegie Mellon (starting at $7,370 for an ef?ciency apartment), but with all of 
Fairfax’s amenities and its prime location, it is understandably so.

McGILL HOUSE
McGill, Carnegie Mellon’s only all-female dorm, offers residents prime doubles and 
singles arranged into suites. Each suite connects two doubles, or two doubles and 
one single. Rooms in McGill are small, meaning residents are often forced to loft 
their beds and sleep only inches from the ceiling. However, the size of the rooms is 
offset by the convenience of semiprivate bathrooms in each suite.
McGill may be one of the smaller dorms, but residents’ social lives are certainly not 
limited. McGill offers a friendly environment, especially since residents can socialize 
in any of the individual ?oor lounges or in the large ?rst-?oor television room and 
study area. Weekly events bring together residents from both Boss and McGill and 
offer a reliable dose of fun and entertainment. Also, when residents tire of their own 
building, they are just a few steps away from other Hill residences.
McGill’s location on Margaret Morrison Street also offers unique perks. Residents 
can catch art exhibitions, shows, and events at The Frame, Carnegie Mellon’s student-
run art gallery on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street. After 
a short walk across the street, residents can take advantage of the nearby campus 
dining locations, including Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and the Zebra 
Lounge. And when campus food gets too monotonous, the food trucks parked 
nearby offer a great alternative to on-campus dining.
But McGill also has its downfalls. The small size of bedrooms ranks at the top of the 
list of complaints. Shared bathrooms with limited hot water, unreliable locks, and tiny 
showers are also concerns. The bathrooms, while slightly dysfunctional, are currently 
cleaned weekly by housekeeping staff, though that may change in coming years. 
Despite the less-than-fabulous facilities, McGill offers female students an excellent 
social experience in a convenient location.
Margaret Morrison Apartments, located on the Hill, offers residents arguably the 
nicest on-campus apartments. Each unit has two ?oors, with a lounge and kitchen on 
the ?rst ?oor and bedrooms and bathrooms either up or down a ?oor, depending on 
the apartment. All of the “Maggie Mo” apartments were redone in 2007, when they 
were re?tted with new furniture, appliances, and countertops.
Although these apartments have a common lounge or living area on the ?rst ?oor, 
the lounges aren’t spacious by any means. The bedrooms, however, are exactly the 
opposite; they are some of the biggest bedrooms that you will ?nd on campus. Each 
apartment has a kitchen, which is nice for upperclassmen tired of campus food.
Each of the Margaret Morrison apartment units is separate from the others, which 
can be isolating, though this is what most upperclassmen prefer. Residents also have 
access to laundry and exercise facilities, which are on the street level of Margaret 
Morrison Street.
Although the common areas may be a bit tight, “Maggie Mo” can offer residents the 
chance to have independence while still living on campus.

NEVILLE CO-OP
While students of most residences have to pull on their shoes and head to campus 
to ?nd a hot meal or a working printer, Morewood Gardens residents need not leave 
the premises. Fully equipped with a computer cluster, a source of convenient (albeit 
greasy) food at The Underground, large laundry rooms, and a gym, this dorm is 
completely self-suf?cient. And what’s more, it’s smack at the corner of Morewood 
and Forbes avenues, only a couple of steps away from campus.
The dorm’s proximity to campus gives it a signi?cant edge over other residential 
areas. This factor maximizes your sleep time before early classes and also allows you 
to sprint back for your homework when you realize you’ve left it in your room. While 
both Stever and Mudge houses are located on Morewood Avenue, they normally 
house only ?rst-year students, making Morewood the only choice for older students 
who want to live in this area.
Morewood’s plentiful lounges, including a few on each ?oor in addition to the larger 
study rooms and TV lounge on the ?rst ?oor, allow for frequent group gatherings. 
While this is a positive attribute for more social students, it means that several rooms 
on each ?oor are likely to experience frequent noise disturbances throughout the day 
and night.
When choosing a room in Morewood, it’s hit-or-miss. Some rooms are spacious and 
quiet, and others are small and loud. It’s the luck of the draw, and sometimes you 
lose. Try to plan out which rooms look best from the ?oor plans online, and try to visit 
a room before committing. This will give you a good idea of what you’re getting.
Morewood Gardens could be a great place to live, but before deciding to move in, 
check out the rooms ahead of time and ask the current residents about the noise 
situation, as some rooms are better than others.
The Neville Co-op is a living community through the Carnegie Mellon housing system, 
comprised of eight apartments that feature a mix of double and single bedrooms. 
Every apartment is connected to one other apartment, which means the four large 
living rooms in the building are each associated with one pair of apartments. All 
apartments in the co-op are fully furnished and include a kitchen and bathroom.
Founded by student activists in 2003 as a center for students interested in 
sustainable living, civil equality, and social progress, the Neville co-op is a democratic 
living community. It has no resident assistants, only liaisons to the Housing and 
Student Life of?ces who help the co-op solve housing problems. This independence 
is a mixed blessing for the co-op’s residents: While they are encouraged to be self-
motivated, the lack of cohesiveness that can result leads to a space that is often 
unkempt and somewhat disorganized.
While the rent for the co-op is comparable to other on-campus apartments, residents 
are allowed to stay through the summer at no extra cost and can sublet if they are 
not in Pittsburgh for the summer months. Residents do have to pay a membership 
fee, which provides each apartment with an internet connection and free laundry 
in the basement — with a year-long supply of environmentally friendly laundry 
detergent, light bulbs, and toilet paper. Additionally, the basement is a common space 
that students use for dinners, leisure, storage, and meetings.
Residents of the co-op must apply for admission and are encouraged to participate 
in the varied events hosted by the current members of the co-op that are held during 
the room selection period.
Once students are interviewed and selected to live in the apartment complex, they 
will ?nd a community of students active in a variety of student organizations. When it 
was founded in 2003, the co-op was created based on the tenets of sustainability and 
environmental awareness, activism, and equality in race, gender, and sexuality.

SHADY OAK APARTMENTS
Home to only Carnegie Mellon students, Shady Oak is perfect for students who 
want a more adult living space. The building follows 24-hour quiet hours, providing 
a more peaceful living environment than most other dormitories or campus-owned 
apartments. Each apartment has a full kitchen with an electric stove and oven, as well 
as a dishwasher. The layouts vary greatly from apartment to apartment, with some 
having single bedrooms and no common living space, others having shared bedrooms 
with spacious living rooms, and others having a combination of the two. 
There is a lounge in the basement with numerous couches and a big-screen TV; 
the space is commonly used for watching sporting events as well as hosting study 
groups. Basic gym equipment is also located in the basement. For students who 
want to keep an active lifestyle and don’t get enough of a workout from the 10-minute 
walk to campus, there are multiple treadmills, an elliptical trainer, and a weight-lifting 
station. The basement is also home to four washers and four dryers — not on the 
eSuds network and accepting only quarters — and a large table for folding laundry.
Venture outside to ?nd a picnic table and charcoal grill that is always available. The 
backyard is large enough to play a game of Frisbee or football with friends. Across 
the street, there is a bus stop for the 71C, which can be taken downtown to watch a 
show or to East Liberty, home of the Waf?e Shop.
There are some drawbacks to living in Shady Oak. The plumbing has a tendency to 
malfunction, sometimes causing pipes to burst, leading to water shut-offs to ?x the 
problem. The radiators have also been a cause for concern, being set on a building-
wide timer that can sometimes shut off in the middle of the night or be set on full 
blast on warmer days.
The Roselawn Terrace houses, located off Margaret Morrison Street, are some of the 
most sought-after housing options on campus. Roselawn is located on the edge of 
campus, providing students with a feeling of independence while still only having to 
walk 10 minutes to class. 
Each house, divided into a single-occupancy room and two double-occupancy rooms, 
holds ?ve students. The bedrooms are quite small — so small, in fact, that one of the 
doubles can’t hold both residents’ desks. The upside to this is that the living area on 
the ?rst ?oor is spacious.
Living rooms have hardwood ?oors and comfortable furniture. Each dining room has 
a large table that seats six by a wall of windows. Kitchens have been completely 
re?nished with new cabinets and appliances. All the walls in the houses have been 
given a fresh coat of paint with vibrant accent colors.
One downside to the Roselawn houses is that residents no longer have access to 
the basement, cutting down on the storage space previously offered. The rooms also 
have closets that tend to be too small for most people’s wardrobes. 
In addition to the large living spaces offered in Roselawn, residents have access to 
the Margaret Morrison lounge and exercise room. All Roselawn residents are also on 
the eSuds network, getting free laundry and access to laundromat-style dryers.
Another good thing about Roselawn houses is that, while there is more than enough 
living space, the cost of living in the house is less than the cost of living in some 
Oakland apartments.
Roselawn houses give the feeling of living on your own, while still providing residents 
with the amenities and assistance of campus housing. If you don’t care about the 
size of your bedroom, Roselawn is the place to live.

WELCH HOUSE/HENDERSON HOUSE
Webster Hall, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and North Dithridge Street, is one 
of the most popular off-campus residences offered by Carnegie Mellon. Webster is 
located in the heart of Oakland, about a 10-minute walk from campus. One of the ?rst 
stops on the Carnegie Mellon shuttle line, Webster offers easy access to the numerous 
restaurants, cafés, convenience stores, and shops located in the Oakland area.
Carnegie Mellon rents out one-bedroom apartments to two students, and two-
bedroom apartments to three students. The apartments are spacious and offer 
many bene?ts that dorm rooms do not, including a fully furnished living room, two 
bathrooms, and a kitchen. For many students, this escape from typical dorm life is the 
basis of Webster’s appeal.
In addition to the spacious apartments, students also bene?t from the facilities 
offered by Webster. The building contains a gym, a homestyle deli, and even an in-
house hair and waxing salon. Additionally, each ?oor has a trash disposal facility as 
well as a laundry room.
There are, however, some small disadvantages. The laundry facilities can become a 
hassle for many residents. Using the facilities can become expensive, with a cost of 
$2.50 to wash and dry one load of clothes. The dryers on most ?oors are not fully 
functional, often requiring two full runs to completely dry clothes. For many students, 
this is one of the biggest complaints about Webster.
An additional point for consideration is the price. Renting a one-bedroom apartment 
or a double bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment costs $8,270 per year. Renting a 
single bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment costs $8,600 per year. 
 
Shirley Apartments, located next door to Webster Hall, contains small apartments 
with a ?oor plan similar to Webster’s. Each apartment has a bedroom, a living area, 
and a kitchen, while the ef?ciencies are essentially rooms with a bathroom and a 
kitchen. One of the downsides of Shirley is that it is one of the farthest places from 
campus. On the upside, the apartments are spacious and well furnished.
As one of the more recently renovated student dorms on campus, Henderson House 
is a clean and quiet place to live. This dorm offers students air-conditioning and 
heating, connected bathrooms — which are cleaned once a week — shared with one 
other room, and the intimacy of a small building, with 20 rooms per ?oor. The ?rst 
?oor is generally reserved for ?rst-years only. 
Henderson House and Welch House are also labeled “Wellness Houses,” in that 
they promote green practices, maintain a substance-free lifestyle, and generally 
encourage healthy living. Each student who lives here is expected to sign an 
agreement promising to adhere to these standards during the school year. Students 
can also take advantage of playing for the house’s intramural teams or participating 
in weekly optional community activities set up by the resident assistants. Tickets to 
special events like plays or shows are subsidized by the dorm, which is a nice perk. 
Henderson, although placed on the outskirts of Carnegie Mellon, is sheltered from 
any traf?c or noise from campus. The dorm’s residents also respect an unwritten 
policy of peace and quiet, which makes this dorm ideal for studying. Despite being 
on a hill, Henderson is very close to the Tepper School of Business, the tennis courts, 
Gesling Stadium, and the eateries at Resnik House, such as the Carnegie Mellon 
Café and Taste of India.
Despite all Henderson has to offer students, there are drawbacks. Dorm rooms are 
not the largest, and on occasion the heating will malfunction, turning each room into 
a furnace. 
 
Welch is one of the Hill houses, but it distinguishes itself by having a 24-hour quiet 
rule. This often means that Welch attracts students who prefer to keep to themselves 
and are less interested in creating a community atmosphere. However, the 
atmosphere seems to suit students who want a comfortable home and don’t want to 
be distracted by noise. The rooms are large and bathrooms are spacious.

WOODLAWN APARTMENTS
Woodlawn Apartments may be one of the older and more run-down housing options 
on campus, but it is convenient for walking to class, and it’s right on the Forbes 
Avenue bus routes that can take you anywhere else that you’d like to go.
The bedrooms and living rooms both boast plenty of space, a de?nite upgrade for 
those used to sharing cramped quarters. Some rooms have hardwood ?oors; others 
have thin carpeting. The furniture has been recently updated, as have some of the 
appliances and bathroom ?xtures, which helps combat the run-down stereotype of 
the building.
In previous years, there have been repeated plumbing problems in the building, 
but maintenance has been quick to ?x them and get things back in order. Several 
times per semester, The Frame art gallery, which is housed in the ?rst ?oor of the 
apartment building, has loud parties that can be heard throughout the building. 
Woodlawn Apartments is great if you want to live with a big group of friends, since 
each apartment houses a lot of people. People generally keep to themselves, but 
this does not mean that residents do not participate in housing activities. There 
are relatively few students in the building, so you’ll probably get to know many of 
the other students that live there. Woodlawn is a good choice if you want a small 
community and are looking for living in an apartment on campus.
Resnik and West Wing are the ideal dormitory choices for students who aren’t ready 
— or aren’t willing — to move off campus but want a bit more of a grown-up place 
to live than a typical dorm. While students in these dorms have the chance to be 
more independent, they also boast a quick walk to any of the academic buildings 
on campus, a de?nite bene?t for those mornings when you just can’t seem to stop 
hitting the snooze button.
Both dorms consist primarily of suites, which are made up of two doubles and a 
single with a common bathroom and lounge for the suite. A limited number of prime 
singles and doubles do exist in the buildings as well, though they are not as well 
known.
Resnik and West Wing are optimal for a group of friends who wish to live together 
but want to maintain their proximity to campus and the other advantages — like free 
toilet paper and a once-a-week bathroom cleaning — that living on campus offers. 
Students mostly stay inside their suites, leaving the hallways relatively quiet. The 
lounges do ?ll up, however — usually with groups of students either working on 
homework or playing video games.
Both buildings offer kitchens on certain ?oors, which is nice when you’ve had your 
?ll of The Exchange and El Gallo de Oro, but if you don’t feel like cooking, Resnik 
is home to a number of dining options. There is the Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie 
Mellon Café, and Resnik Café. In particular, Resnik Café offers a variety of choices, 
including sushi, Indian cuisine, and comfort foods, among others.
With the numerous amenities that Resnik and West Wing offer, it is not surprising 
that both of these dorms ?ll up early in the room selection process. Hopeful residents 
are advised to ?nd a friend who can pull them in.

Just a 10-to-15-minute walk (or ?ve-minute bus ride) from campus lies the neighborhood of Oakland, 
the home of late-night food, University of Pittsburgh pride, and a population made up almost entirely of 
college students. Oakland is home to some of Carnegie Mellon students’ favorite restaurants, including 
The ‘O’, Chipotle, Chick-?l-A, Fuel and Fuddle, and Mad Mex. For those over 21, Oakland has a good 
group of late-night destinations, such as local bars like Hemingway’s, Mad Mex with its classic half-
price margaritas, and a liquor store with an extensive selection, all within walking distance. Another 
bene?t of Oakland is its availability of affordable housing close to campus. Oakland Avenue and Atwood 
Avenue are lined with student housing for both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students.
Most people living here are always up for fun; if you’re looking for a quiet neighborhood, Oakland may 
not be it. Starting on Thursday nights — the start of the weekend for Pitt students — the neighborhood 
awakens, ?lled with groups of college kids out to have a good time. Oakland should be noted for its lively 
atmosphere and is ideal for anyone looking for an extended weekend and college-oriented surroundings.
OAKLAND
Shadyside is home to upperclass students from Carnegie Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh, graduate students, and young working professionals. Accessible by Pittsburgh 
buses, it tends to be slightly pricier than Oakland or Squirrel Hill; however, it is the most 
charming of the areas surrounding campus, with its tree-lined streets and boutiques. The 
neighborhood is best known for two things: shops and bars. Walnut Street is lined with a wide 
variety of shops, from small boutiques to Apple, J. Crew, Ann Taylor, and Banana Republic. Cozy 
restaurants like the Walnut Grill are dispersed among the shops.
Just blocks from the restaurants are Shadyside’s bars. William Penn Tavern and Shady Grove 
are the most popular, known by Carnegie Mellon students as the closest bar locations outside of 
Panther Hollow Inn. William Penn Tavern in particular gathers a large number of Carnegie Mellon 
students. On Tuesdays and Sundays, William Penn Tavern is open to all ages for its wing nights 
where customers can get 10 wings in a variety of ?avors, from traditional BBQ to the ?avor mix of 
“the kitchen sink,” for a great price.
While the area near these bars can be particularly loud from Thursday to Sunday, Shadyside in 
general is a very relaxed, quiet area. The young professionals and the college students who live 
in the area are very diverse  — from artists to technical majors to medical students. Shadyside 
is a great area for anyone looking for either an escape from campus or a bustling shopping and 
nightlife experience.

Just up the big hill on Forbes Avenue is the start of Squirrel Hill. 
It is either a 20-minute walk or a three-minute bus ride from 
campus, and the buses are very frequent — all of the 61 buses 
serve the route. The cost of living is higher than Oakland but lower 
than Shadyside. Furthermore, Squirrel Hill is the most residential 
of all the areas surrounding campus. In addition to housing 
upperclass students from Carnegie Mellon, it is also home to 
faculty and Pittsburgh families not associated with the university. 
Most Carnegie Mellon students know the neighborhood for its 
restaurants and Giant Eagle. Squirrel Hill has a vast diversity of 
restaurants, from Thai food at Silk Elephant to Mediterranean food 
at Mediterranean Grill to the famous desserts at Gullifty’s. The 
restaurants are dispersed among small shops, including those on 
the main thoroughfare of Forbes Avenue.
On Murray Avenue, just off of Forbes, the Giant Eagle is the 
perfect one-stop shop for all of your food necessities. Squirrel Hill 
is relatively quiet, with most noise coming from traf?c on Forbes 
and Murray avenues. It is not a college neighborhood like Oakland 
or Shadyside, and it does not have a prominent bar scene. It does 
have a certain functionality and residential atmosphere, however, 
that the other two areas lack. 
For someone looking for a short ride or walk from campus with 
all the necessities within walking distance and a wide variety of 
cuisines, Squirrel Hill may be the place.
