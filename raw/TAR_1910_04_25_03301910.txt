MR. ADVERTISER
Do you really know the advertising 
value of a school paper? Do you 
realize that Carnegie Tech is the larg­
est technical school in the United 
States—not going to be any more, but 
IS? Do you realize that 2500 students 
are enrolled here—enough to make a 
good sized town with no children or 
old people? Do you know that The 
Tartan is its only student paper and 
appears 36 times during the school 
year? Now, Mr. Advertiser, don’t you 
think it would pay to let these young 
money spenders (three-fourths are 
men) know what you have to sell? For

VOL. IV(H\e (Tartan
PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 1910No. 25
MR. CARNEGIE TO BE HERE FRIDAY
Founder to See Schools in Session for First Time.
The feeling charging the air about the Schools for 
the last two weeks may be described as that amount 
of static interest and enthusiasm impossible to keep 
under control. When the first announcement was 
made that the Founder was really coming after all 
these years, intense pleasure was expressed on every 
hand. As the time draws nearer it has been chang­
ing into a wildfire of impatience.
Mr. Carnegie will arrive at the Hotel Schenley, 
where he will* be quartered during his visit, early 
Friday morning, and after having breakfast will 
proceed at once to the Schools. The morning will 
be spent visiting the different departments in the 
most thorough way his limited time will allow. 
Luncheon will likely take place in the “House” at 
the Margaret Morrison School. The latter part of 
the afternoon will be taken up with a meeting of
the Board of Trustees, so it will be impossible to 
state in advance how much of his time will be spent 
seeing the Schools.
In the evening a monster mass meeting of the 
student body is planned for seven o’clock, at which 
he will address the assemblage. It is especially
desired that no demonstration of any kind shall be 
made by the students while Mr. Carnegie is inspect­
ing the ¡Schools. While he is at the Schenley late
Friday afternoon, however, would be an admirable
time for a serenade and perhaps a buggy ride.
The next day he will give dinners to the trustees 
of the Carnegie foundations, the Hero Fund, the
Institute, and the Technical Schools. On Sunday, 
the only event he is scheduled to attend is the organ 
recital given by Mr. Charles Heinroth, the city or­
ganist.
VARSITY WIN FROM ALUMNI
Final Score 8—7 in Loosely Played Game.
The Alumni and the Varsity got together in a 
practice game last Saturday on T^ch field, the 
Varsity finally winning out by the narrow margine of 
8 to 7. The Alumni outplayed and outbatted the Var­
sity men for the first six innings, when with a change 
of pitchers, the Varsity began to forge ahead. The 
“old grads” played together well and in that respect 
had it on Captain Coldren’s men. The form of the 
Varsity can by no means be judged by this game as 
only one of the regular infield played his position 
and that, together with the absence of Captain Col-
dren at second, did much towards making the score 
close.
One of the features of the game was the catching 
of Wehr. He was put in behind the bat in the absence 
of the regular catcher and caught a splendid game. 
He has a whip that argues ill for any one trying to 
steal on him, his throws being altogether too much 
for either Mason or Blanchard to handle.
It seemed quite natural to see “Baskets” Barclay 
squating behind the batsman, catching Burnsides, 
whose shirt tail was flying in the wind as of yore.

4THE TARTAN
On first Casey, late of the Electricals, sported with 
the wild heaves that came from Wisner and Whit­
man at third and Olnhausen at short. Captain Lytle 
did his usual stunts at second and, incidently, made 
a couple of very boneheaded plays with McKinley, 
who relieved Casey at first base. These same plays, 
together with Burnside weakening, gave the game to 
the Varsity.
Bert Colmery, ex-manager of the Varsity, tried to 
play middle field, much to the amusement of the 
spectators. The other two out field positions were 
well handled by Guy Halferty and Slocum.
Captain Coldren sent three pitchers in at different 
stages of the game; of the three, the work of Braun
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL SOCIETY
A great part of an engineer’s career is spent in 
seeking and obtaining technical information. Some­
times this information is easily secured, but in the 
great majority of cases its acquisition is attended 
with many difficulties. Therefore, when he can ob­
tain the desired knowledge at first hand from a man 
who is recognized authority on the subject, he is a 
very fortunate individual, indeed. Such was the 
enviable position of those who attended the regular 
monthly meeting of the Carnegie Mechanical Soci­
ety in Machinery Hall, Saturday night, March 12, 
and heard Mr. S. E. Ward of the Westinghouse Ma­
chine Company deliver his illustrated address on 
“Gas Producers.”
Mr. Ward is an authority on gas producers and 
his address was received with marked attention. It 
was very interesting and described numerous pro­
ducers in this and foreign countries. A great many 
of these plants were installed under Mr. Ward’s di­
rect supervision, and almost all of them had been vis­
ited at some time or other by him. As a consequence, 
his talk, aside from his technical details, was some­
what in the nature of a personal narrative. Many 
interesting points were brought out about the practi­
cal operation of these producers and their attending 
difficulties, as well as the many ingenuous methods 
used for overcoming these troubles.
Mr. Ward devoted a considerable part of his talk 
to the technical side of gas producers, and although 
a Westinghouse man, he did not slight other types. 
He gave a very thorough description of the Westing­
house Nan-Bituminous (pressure) Producer, R. D. 
Wood (suction) Producer, Loomis Pettibone (gener­
ator set) Producer, Mond (pressure) Producer, at 
Beunos Ayres, Brazil, and Westinghouse Bituminous 
(double zone) Producer. He discussed at some length 
the fuels used in different sections of the country, 
and ended his talk with some estimates of the rela- 
tiv cost of producer gas as compared with natural 
gas. After the close of his address a general dis­
cussion was indulged in by all present.
The final event of the evening was the regular 
meeting of the society. All routine and special busi- 
nss was disposed of. A communication was received 
from the Mho, Crucible and Civil Clubs relative to
looked the best as he used his head at all stages. 
Whyrock, of the Three-I League, who has been coach­
ing the pitchers, umpired the game.
After the game Captain Coldren made the follow­
ing statement:
“I can’t tel lthe exact make up of the team as yet 
as it is far from settled. I wish that some more men 
would come out and try for pitchers, men who hereto­
fore have not turned out. The night men have not 
come out as strongly as they might and it is not too 
late yet. If there are any night men who can pitch 
let them come to the next practice and I will be only 
too glad to receive them.”
holding a joint dance. A committee was appointed 
to confer with the officials of these organizations. 
Committee consists of Edward Noonan, fifth year 
night, and G. W. Smith and M. T. Archer, senior day 
classes. It was decided that the next meeting of the 
society the special speaker would be dispensed with, 
and that several technical papers would be read by 
members instead. Meeting was then adjourned un­
til Saturday, April 2, 1910.
THE BRENNAN MONO-RAIL CAR.
A succesful. demonstration was given recently at 
New Brompton, of the Brennan mono-rail car. At 
the trial an 80-horse-power generating set was work­
ing. The trials commenced with running the vehicle, 
loaded with packing cases, round the circular track 
of 105 feet radius at a speed approaching 20 miles an 
hour. The stability of the car under these conditions 
was apparently all that could be wished, the vehicle 
canting over several degrees toward the center of 
the circle of the track. This demonstra­
tion was followed by an exhibition of the 
facilities afforded by such a car for unloading. The 
vehicle was intentionally tilted over on to chocks on 
the right-hand side and some cases unloaded. It was 
then righted and tilted over toward the left side, 
and other cases unloaded, being finally righted again, 
all these operations of tilting and righting being per­
formed solely with the assistance of the gyroscope 
gear. The next trial consisted in carrying passengers 
round the circular track. About fifty passengers 
were taken at a time, and several complete circuits 
of the one-eighth of a mile track were made with 
each load. During these runs we timed several rounds 
at speeds of between 18 and 20 miles an hour. The 
motion on board was quite pleasant, the vehicle rid­
ing very well. The inward cant that the vehicle ac­
quires when traveling on curves at high speed nat­
urally added to, rather than detracted from, the com­
fort of the passengers. Altogether some 300 persons 
had an opportunity of being on the carriages under 
these novel conditions. The demonstration which 
followed showed the ability of the vehicle to take 
sharp curves, this, however, revealing nothing more 
than was evident from the earlier trial toward the 
close of last year. The carriage, with passengers on

board, was then run backward and forward at as 
high a speed as was practicable along the straight 
with perfect success. The light lateral swaying un­
der these conditions was quite easy, and free from 
jerks and jolts, and not at all unpleasant. The os­
cillation is of very small amplitude, as the controlling 
action of the gyroscopes quickly damps out any ten­
dency to a larger movement.—Engineering (London).
COMETS EXPECTED IN 1910
The present year promises to be particularly rich 
in comets. Four comets, those of Winnecke, Dan­
iel, Hailey and Inness, have been or are already visi­
ble. Inness’s comet, which was very bright, appeared 
suddenly, it will be recalled, in the midst of a recent 
auroral display at Johannesburg. In addition to these 
four, seven periodic comets are expected to return in 
1910. Probably not all of these comets will be visi­
ble, because some will be unfavorably situated with 
irespect to the sun at the time of periheli passage. 
The expected comets are the following: 1. Giaco- 
bini’s Comet, 1896 V. It was first thought that this 
comet would reach its perihelion about the middle 
of February, but later calculations have proved that 
it really passed its perihelion last December. It has©not yet been seen and, as its position is very unfav­
orable, it may escape observation altogether. 2. 
Swift’s comet, 1895 II. This comet was not seen at 
its return in 1902, and unless its orbit has been con­
siderably changed, the conditions for its observation 
will be still less favorable this year. It should have 
passed its perihelion about the end of January, and 
should then have been almost exactly behind the sun. 
3. The second periodic comet of Tempel should reach 
its perihelion about February 21st, unless its orbit 
has been greatly changed since 1904, when the comet 
was last seen. The conditions for observing this 
comet in its perihelion passage this year are, how­
ever, very unfavorable as, like Swift’s comet, it is 
almost behind the sun. 4. I)'Arrest’s comet was
seen for the first time in 1897; it was expected to 
return in 1904, but was not observed, owing to unfav­
orable conditions. This year, if its orbit is not 
changed, it will reach its perihelion in October. Its 
position then will be very favorable for observation, 
so that this comet will probably be visible next sum­
mer. 5. Spitaler’s comet, 1890 VII, escaped detec­
tion at its visits in 1897 and 1903, because of poor 
conditions for observation. Dr. Hopfer, of Trieste, 
has shown that the orbit of this cdmet has been 
greatly altered by perturbations caused by the influ­
ence of Jupiter between 1890 and 1903. In conse­
quence óf these perturbations, the periodic time of 
the comet has been increased from 6.42 years to 
6.82 years. The comet should pass its perihelion in 
October, 1910, in conditions favorable to its redis­
covery. 6. Faye’s comet is also expected to return 
in the latter part of October in conditions favorable 
for observation. 7. Brook's comet, 1889 V, is ex­
pected to reach its perihelion in the summer of 1911,
but it will probably be discovered during the coming 
summer.—Scientific American.
Th feamous Mr. Fletcher addressed the entire 
school, including the faculty, on Thursday, March 17. 
He talked for three-quarters of an hour, giving only 
a few bare facts about his wonderful system. He 
spoke very forcefully about the value of temperance 
in eating, and the influence of one’s disposition on 
one’s health.
Dr. Rosaline Mortan gave a short talk to the Jun­
ior and .Senior classes in Social Ethics on Tuesday.
A THRILLING EXPERIENCE
For the past week, freezing weather had prevailed, 
so that many ice-boats could be seen flying here and 
there over the ice, like huge white birds. But I 
never quite realized what a thrilling sport ice-boating 
was, until I found myself lying flat in the bottom of 
the boat, and hanging on “for dear life,” with the 
cold, biting wind blowing full in my face.
At first we started off slowly, but the next moment 
the boat shot ahead like a rocket. I was just think­
ing that we were traveling faster than the wind, 
when suddenly one runner rose high up in the air, 
then down it fell with a thud. I no sooner caught my 
breath again than up went the opposite runner. Then 
the big sail flopped over and the cry was “Duck 
heads!” and while I clung breathlessly to the hand­
rail, the bird-like boat sailed off faster than ever.
When at last I stepped on solid ground again, I 
heaved a little sigh of relief in spite of myself.

PLEBES
Prof Doyle (in English.) “A potato bug is not a 
bug.”
When Prof. Wurtz said in his last lecture that he 
was sorry to have the Plebe class leaving him, some 
seemed to doubt his statement. Probably they will 
change their minds when they get an R in this sem­
ester’s work and have a chance to repaet.
It would be well for some of the Plebes to read 
some of Beatrice Fairfax’s letters on the age for be­
coming engaged and getting married.
Manager Miller, of the Plebe baseball team, has 
scheduled eight games for this season. The first 
practice was held Monday and quite-a number of men 
were out for each position.
It is rumored that congratulations are in order 
for Scottie. How about it, Traver?

EDITORIAL
STUDENT ACTIVITIES AGAIN.
It was just at the time of the annual Glee Clubi 
concert that we found it opportune to speak of the 
relation existing between student activities and the 
eligibility rules. We then said that it might be ar­
ranged so as to make the managers of the musical 
and dramatic clubs feel a little mere sure of their 
ground, if they knew that all of ithe needed men 
were not liable to be declared ineligible about three 
days before the appearance of tihe organization. In 
that case it was the ruling on the Glee Club that 
precipitated the remarks, and now it is the White 
Friars.
As old Remeses II. may have found it convenient 
to remark, there are two sides to every question., 
Now for the sake of variety, we are going to give* 
the other side. As things stand now, there is some­
thing wrong somewhere, and we would like to find 
out where the fault lies.
For a long time we have been hearing two things 
from the faculty: to do nothing half-heartied, and 
that if a student has five hours of flunks against his 
name he is down aud out as far as his participation 
in activities goes. At first glance this looks very 
nice. It means to put out the best of everything, 
and thereby add to the good name of Ithe Institution 
and on the side prove a good advertisement that will
draw students here, and to keep the standard of the 
work on a level witih, or above thalt to be found in 
other technical schools. Both these criterions are 
quite the proper spirit. We are sincere in saying we 
are strong for both. But it happens, however, that 
the combination of the two cannot be worked out by 
any known method of mathematics. The problem 
demands the widest treatment.
The students place emphasis on activities and the 
faculty on the requirements of scholarship. At the 
present time it looks as though both were trying to 
outdo the other in independently pushing the point 
from Itheir respective points of view. (Witness the 
past Glee Club trouble and that now facin-g the 
White Friars.) The White Friars have set a high 
mark and are trying their best to reach it, the fac­
ulty have piled on work to make (the Schools more 
effective and have the power of probating as their 
most forcible argument. The White Friars are quite 
correct in their endeavor, for we know it is in har­
mony with their understanding of whalt the faculties 
think is creditable to the Schools. The faculty have 
caught the idea that the Carnegie Technical Schools 
are to be made the most efficient in the United 
States. So here we are. Deadlocked again.
There is a limit to the amount of work that even a 
technical studfent can endure. If the idea now being 
enforced by the facullties is correct, then our student 
activities are planned on too extensive a scale. The 
Glee Club rehearse for months, and give their an­
nual concert in the best place Pittsburg affords; the 
White Friars go even farther, for they drill men so 
hard for Ithe dancing choruses that most of them 
find it necessary to go into training to endure the 
strain. But the point of it is, they put out an ar­
ticle in college dramatics (that may be equaled, but 
is not excelled by any visiting this city. These 
things cannot be done with less preparation. Now 
what are we to do? Have the Friars get up a little 
vaudeville show to be put on in Ithe Assembly Hall, 
or have them continue on their present partee? One 
thing is mighty certain at this point: if any more 
men are declared out of the Friars at this late dalte, 
they might just as well quit right now and pass up 
the show. Common sense can see this, and no fac­
ulty ruling can change or alter the fact...It is any­
thing but business to sign up certain contracts in­
volving expenditures of student money, and then 
have no idea if the men selected will be retained! 
long enough to make it possible to fulfill those con­
tracts. In other words, the business manager of the 
White Friars would be perfectly justified in calling 
the entire show off, unless he is assured that the 
men now rehearsing can play in May. One man out 
of the cast four weeks before the time of the first 
performance is a very serious thing. Two or three 
from the chorus makes it necessary Ito accustom the 
entire company to the difference.
A complete list of all candidates was sent the' 
rounds of the Deans for approval three weeks ago, 
and the company adjusted accordingly. The men

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN7
then officially declared in good standing were assign­
ed parts. The management and stage director of 
the Friars understood that this was all that was 
necessary and proceeded accordingly. Last week 
word came that enough men from two of the schools 
had been placed on probation to make it impossible 
to pult on the show without adding to the coimpany. 
Let it be very clearly understood that we are not 
questioning the right of placing these men on proba­
tion. We know it was strictly in accordance with 
the ruling of the faculties. We DO question the 
wiseness of making the ruling apply to men indis- 
pensible to the Friars so close to the time of pro­
duction.
If the committee on student organizations and 
publications will review the situation a little more 
in the light of things as they actually are, we are of 
the opinion that they can pass regulations that will 
greatly if net entirely remedy the situation. If the 
management of the Friars is given a chance to sub­
mit a list of their candidates to the Registrar for 
approval for the remainder of the season, then they 
can do business. The way i!t is now, they can’t. One 
list when the trials are in progress could be given 
the Deans, who could determine by the man’s previ­
ous standing if he was to be trusted with keeping 
his work up during the time of rehearsals and per­
formances. If in the judgment of the Dean he could 
or could not, LET IT BE SETTLED THEN who can 
play and who cannot. The presenlt system neither 
permits businesslike action on the part of the Friars 
or similar organizations nor reflects very much 
credit on the committee.
THE FOUNDER’S VISIT.
It can safely be said that no single event since ¡the 
founding of the Schools should create more interest 
than the coming visit of the Founder, Mr. Andrew 
Carnegie. With that event comes the chance of the 
executive force, the faculty and the student body to 
know how close to the original idea in his mind, the 
Carnegie Technical Schools are at the present time. 
It will be a time when the grateful appreciation of 
the student body can be shown to the Founder for 
the opportunity held out to so many. In the fifth 
year of existence and now the largest technical 
school in the United States, the Schools will be 
shown to him in operation during the day, and then 
we can look for words of guidance and instruction1 
in the evening as to how best to continue to im­
prove. We are greatly pleased that this visit should 
be made, and have but the one regret: that i't is the 
first.
COMING NUMBERS.
The issue of next week will be a special one, and 
the most elaborate we have attempted this year. 
It will be called “The Founder’s Number,” and will 
have special reference to the visit of Mr. and Mrs.
Carnegie. The plaid indicated on the present cover 
will be printed in full color and as many good pho­
tographs of the Founder and accompanying party 
as can be secured will be used in the issue. Since 
the expense of getting up the special features will 
be considerable, all copies of this one number sold 
will be ten cents each. Subscribers receive their 
copies as usual with no additional charge. The issue 
will be suitable for mailing as a souvenir, and as it 
is expected a number will be issued for this purpose, 
an extra supply will be printed.
“The Hook-Worm Number” will likely follow the 
next week and material for “The All-Gossip Num­
ber’' is fast accumulating.
We hope to have the extreme pleasure of getting 
up “The White Friars Number” in the near future, 
but if certain things keep happening ¡¡t may be in 
nature of an issue “IN ME.MORIAM.”
We feel like apologizing for the leanness of both 
this issue and that of last week, but blame it all on 
the vacation in three of the four schools. Next 
week will make up for it all right.
FORMER PROF. ALAUX ENGAGED.
Much interest is attached to the recent announce­
ment of the engagement of Former Prof. Jean P. 
ALaux, A. D. G. of the School of Applied Design. 
Since leaving the Schools for the balmy zephyrs of 
.sunny France, the genial professor has been en­
gaged in important architectural work, and at the 
present time is preparing plans for the new country 
residence of President Falleries of the French Re­
public. His work on these plans does not consume 
all of the time and plans for the future have re­
ceived much consideration. The lady of his attach­
ment is Miss Moore, a daughter of the manager of 
the Paris branch of Tiffany’s. The wedding is to 
take place some time in the summer.
NOTICE TO MUSICIANS!
WANTED—All men in good standing who are pro­
ficient in orchestra work, are requested to take inter­

bulletin boards, announcement of time and place of 
meeting can be learned.
On March 1st and 2nd Mr. Henry Farnham made 
some record flights with passengers with a new 
biplane. His machine was originally built for the 
Rheims meeting last August, but it did not fly then 
owing to an accident. Despite its small size and sur­
face, it showed excellent lifting power and stability. 
The spread of the upper part is 34 feet, while the 
lower plane is 12 feet or 14 feet shorter, besides hav­
ing a large section cut away in the center to accommo­
date the propeller. Movable flaps are fitted to the 
back edges of the extensions of the upper plane only, 
and the tail consists of but a single horizontal surface 
between the two halves of the vertical rudder. The

swerve. He used small vertical fins, 1x2 feet in size, 
and found that these could be set at right angles to 
the line of flight for a few seconds without causing 
the aeroplane to swerve from a straight path and 
without moving the vertical rudder. As the resistance 
of the balancing planes which Curtiss uses is far 
less than is obtained in the manner just described, 
there can be no turning tendency produced by them, 
and hence no use of the vertical rudder in conjunc­
tion with them. Mr. Curtiss has also flown with the 
vertical rudder tied and with it loose, showing that 
a movement of this rudder is not required. We also
learn that the Antoinette monoplane has been flown 
with the vertical rudder left off. With these prac­
tical demonstrations of flight without the use of the 
Wrights’ patented combination, there seems to be 
little doubt that any infringement suits they may 
institute will be successfully defended—Scientific 
American.
The Carnegie Tech baseball team will leave this 
evening (Thursday) for Bellefonte, Pa., where they 
will meet th Bllfont Acadmy tam tomorrow afternoon. 
The squad will then go to State College and play 
State Saturday afternoon. The boys will return 
home Sunday. Two other games had been arranged 
on this trip, but Manager Keally was forced to cancel 
both contests, as the faculty changed the time of 
vacation at the schools from this week to last week.
The team will be the strongest that ever faced 
State College, and one of the best games of the sea­
son is expected, as reports from State say that the 
State boys are confident of victory. It was thought 
that Captain Coldren would be unable to play on ac­
count of an injured ankle, but it is in better condition 
than was expected, and he will be in the lineup.
Last night the team did nothing but go through 
batting practiec, as they are a little weak in this de­
partment of the game. The pitchers worked on the 
side lines and are in the pink of condition. The home 
season will open next Saturday afternoon with the 
University of Pittsburgh Independents. The game 
will be played on Leeds Field.

10THE TARTAN
Who Was Shot?
A duel was fought in Texas by Alexander Shott 
and John S. 'Nott. Nott was shot and Shott was not. 
In that case it was better to be Shott than Nott.
There was a rumor that Nott was shot and Shott 
avows that he .shot Nott, which proves either -that 
the shot Shott shot at Nott was not shot, or that 
Nott was iShott, notwithstanding. Circumstantial 
evidence is not always good. It was made to appear 
on trial that the shot ¡Shott shot, shot Nott, or, as 
accidents are frequent with firearms, it might have 
been possible that the shot Shott shot, shot Shott 
himself, when the whole affair would resolve into 
the original elements, and (Shott would be shot and 
Nott would be not.
We think, however, that the shot Shott shot, shot 
not Shott, but Nott. Anyway, it is hard to tell who 
was shot.—Ex.
INDIA.
India And Its Customs.
Miss Stanford, of Nasie, Western India, made an 
address for St. Peter’s, W.A., Cobourg, Ont., telling 
of the burdens of native customs and ideas. She told 
of good work in women’s hospitals. Some of the girls 
trained by the missionaries are teaching in the Hindu 
(heathen) schools. India is going to be brought to 
Christ by the boys and girls of the schools.
A woman’s crowning glory is her hair, but the 
widows of India are compelled to shave their heads 
every two weeks. They may not marry again, and 
the widow is the butt of the family. For twenty- 
four hours after her husband’s death she must not 
eat anything. She has only one meal the next day 
and must fast two days during certain periods after­
wards. She must do all the praying of the family, 
and this is a good deal. She is treated unkindly be­
cause her people are afraid of the gods. They tell 
her she must have been a scorpion, a snake, in her 
former life, and that is why she is punished. A bride 
wears five pairs of green bangles, and later wears a 
black necklace to indicate that she is married. A 
child wears a bracelet to keep away the evil eye; if 
the bracelet be lost it is considered that the evil eye 
has got the child, who is then blamed for everything, 
even the failure of crops.
Several gods were exhibited. Of one there is a 
legend that he would have drowned but that, when 
the water reached a certain height it disappeared and 
left him on dry land. This god is so constructed that 
when the wrater reaches a certain height, it runs out 
by syphon effect, and this is taken as a proof of 
miracle.—Church Life.

Approximately 1,450 men are engaged in some 
form of athletic activity at Yale, either in the major 
or minor .sports, according to figures compiled at the 
university for the year 1909-1910. The statistics in­
clude the academic and scientific departments and 
the graduate schools. Detailed figures show a pre­
ponderance of academic men in the various sports.
The latest fashion in signing excuse blanks has 
been set by an Armour Tech man, who wrote “una­
voidably sick.”
The profits from “Koanzaland,” the comic opera 
presented at Michigan this year exceeded $2,000.
