Bus deal awaits student reaction
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
Last Monday, a preliminary 
agreement to allow CMU stu≠
dents and faculty complete ac≠
cess to all Port Authority Tran≠
sit (PAT) services was approved. 
A student referendum has been 
drafted and will be conducted 
next week.
According to Michael Murphy, 
dean of Student Affairs, the deal 
is very much modeled on the cur≠
rent agreement between the Uni≠
versity of Pittsburgh and PAT.
The agreement would allow 
those with a validated CMU ID to 
ride all PAT bus routes, the un≠
derground T, and special routes 
including the Airport Flyer, mall 
routes, and buses to special 
events. The arrangement would 
be a five-year deal, and pending a 
student referendum and approval
by the PAT board, will commence 
July 1.
Currently, Pitt students pay 
around $55 for access to PAT, 
though a shuttle charge is also 
included in that fee.
All CMU graduate and under≠
graduate students would have to 
pay a mandatory fee of $35 per 
semester to cover the costs of 
riding on PAT. There is also a 
possibility that there could be as 
much as a $5 per-semester in≠
crease in the future, depending 
on CMU and PAT evaluation of 
ridership. According to Murphy, 
PAT will probably conduct such 
an evaluation two weeks during 
next fall semester. Drivers will 
be asked to count CMU IDs dur≠
ing this period to get an estimate 
of the amount of students using 
the PAT vehicles. Based on these 
numbers, CMU adminstration

By ANNE RAY
Dossier Literary Editor
Between February 23 and 24, 
two members of Student Senateís 
Executive Committee and the Stu≠
dent Body Treasurer resigned. 
They left behind three vacant posi≠
tions ó and a mix of professional 
problems and personal issues.
Throughout the semester, 
Senate has been fighting a
stream of internal difficulties, 
culminating in these resignations 
and resulting in a slow-down of 
external business, according to 
Senate sources.
, Sophomore electrical computer 
engineering (ECE) major Alex 
Markle, former Senate Funding 
& Recognition (F&R) Chair, re≠
signed on February 23. Later 
that day, senior ECE major and 
then-Student Body Treasurer
Keith Rothschild resigned. Both 
Markle and Rothschild cited ac≠
tions of Senate Chair Robb 
Moskowitz, an information and 
decision systems major, as a par≠
tial reason for their resignation. 
The next day, Moskowitz, a se≠
nior information decision sys≠
tems major, also formally an≠
nounced his resignation.
Two out of the three vacant 
positions have since been filled.
Senate elected senior biology 
major Jamie Chang as student 
body treasurer, and senior ECE 
major Charlie Anthe as Senate 
Chair. The F&R Chair position 
remains vacant.
According to Student Body 
President Sarah Gross, a junior 
history major, not all of the bases 
in the ongoing budgeting pro≠
cesses were covered as a result of 
Senateís personnel turnover.
ìSome student organizations 
have had trouble getting in touch 
with the right people,î said Gross. 
ìThe Joint Funding Committee 
has been really understanding 
on giving extensions, individual 
members have contacted student 
organizations, and theyíve held 
an info session. People have ex≠
perienced frustration, but I re≠
ally think all organizations will 
be taken care of.î
Gross, as well as Rothschild and 
Markle, said that as Chair, 
Moskowitz did not give their opin≠
ions fair treatment in discussions 
and meetings. Prior to these resig≠
nations, Moskowitz was asked to 
remove himself from his position.
ìSome people in Senate were 
set against [Moskowitz as] chair,î 
said Gross. ìAnd they made it 
clear that they would have started

Art major wins state-wide scholarship
By MAUREEN McGRANAGHAN
Tartan Staffwriter
This coming summer, Emily Merz, a 
junior art major, will be on her way to 
St. Petersburg, Russia on a $4,000 
dollar grant from the Vira Heinz Foun≠
dation. The award, given annually to a 
junior woman for study abroad be≠
tween junior and senior years, will 
enable her to study Russian while 
teaching English to teenagers in a 
Russian orphanage.
ìShe had a very strong proposal and 
no previous experience abroad, so weíre 
giving her an opportunity. Thatís part 
of the Vira Heinz mission,î said Eva 
Mergner, study abroad advisor for the 
Office of International Education and 
head of the selection committee.
Merz has two adopted brothers from 
Russia, and she has spent the last 
year interviewing, photographing, and 
painting other Pittsburgh families who 
have adopted Russian children. ìIt 
was in my head to go to Russia, but it 
wasnít something I thought was pos≠
sible,î said Merz. ìThen, when I heard 
about the scholarship, the plan began 
to form more concretely.î
Merz made contact with the orphan≠
ages through a Pittsburgh represen≠
tative of Rainbow International, the 
agency that facilitated her brothersí 
adoption. During her six weeks in St. 
Petersburg, she will be working in a 
halfway house, preparing Russian 
teenagers for life outside an institu≠
tion. ëThese are kids who have been in 
orphanages all their lives, and Iíll be 
speaking English to them, so they have 
a better chance of getting a job. At the 
same time, theyíll be helping me with 
my Russian,î said Merz. She also plans 
to work with infants and toddlers at a 
different institution.
ìRainbow International is working 
to establish a volunteer network in 
Russian orphanages, and these avail≠
able opportunities increased the scope 
and feasibility of her project,î said
Mary Lalonde, a senior biology major 
and member of the student committee 
that helped select Merz. Lalonde won 
the Vira Heinz award last year for sum≠
mer study and volunteer work in Africa.
ìIím looking at adoption from both 
sides,î said Merz. ìRight now, Iím focus≠
ing on the families here who have 
adopted. When I go to Russia Iíll be 
seeing the country thatís sending its 
children.î Merz currently has an exhibi≠
tion in the University Center art gallery 
featuring her work with adoptive fami≠
lies in the Pittsburgh area. ìMy favorite 
part of the exhibition was having the 
families come and point themselves out 
in the paintings,î she said. ìWhen I 
come back I want 
to have some 
kind of forum ó 
maybe a Web ex≠
hibition ó that 
will bring to≠
gether the Rus≠
sian orphanages 
and the adoptive 
families here in 
the U.S.î [Ed.

The Vira Heinz 
Award was insti≠
tuted in 1965 at
11 different uni≠
versities prima≠
rily in Pennsyl≠

tion includes 
both a proposal 
and an interview, 
and Carnegie 
Mellonís Office of

Education tradi≠
tionally receives 
between 13 and 
16 applications a 
year. ìItís defi≠
nitely a competi≠
tive process in Emily Merz will travel
that the proposals are all very good,î 
Mergner said. ìOne year we even asked 
if we could split the award, but the 
Vira Heinz foundation said no.î
ìEmilyís application has a lot of 
breadth, and her contact at Rainbow 
International led me to believe she 
will be prepared for what sheíll face in 
Russia,î said Lalonde.
Senior art major Eva Tarbell served 
as the other student representative on 
the committee.
ìEmily has a lot of background and 
personal interest in her project,î said 
Tarbell. ìThereís just so many facets 
to it. Itís a very personal experience 
and also a very cultural experience.î

Hill dorms get upgraded
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Personnel Manager
Although members of next yearís first- 
year class have not even received their 
letters of acceptance yet, Housing Ser≠
vices has already taken a number of 
steps to better the living conditions these 
students will encounter when they ar≠
rive on campus this fall. The most sig≠
nificant changes for the upcoming school 
year include major renovations for 
Scobell House and some smaller im≠
provements throughout many other resi≠
dence halls around campus.
According to Dave Myers, assistant 
director of Housing Services for Facili≠
ties, Scobell House will be completely 
renovated, with about a quarter of the 
walls in the building slated to be moved. 
While the exterior of the building was 
refurbished last summer for primarily 
aesthetic reasons, the current plans to 
change the interior have a number of 
practical objectives.
ìIn general, when doing renovations, 
we try to bring a building up to current 
codes, increase the functionality of the 
space, and enhance community develop≠
ment,î said Tim Michael, director of 
Housing Services.
Michael said that one of the main 
concerns to be addressed is the line-of- 
sight problem regarding the bathrooms 
on each floor. Since they are currently 
located right across from the center stair≠
case, the bathrooms are highly visible to 
people traveling up and down in the 
building. In order to solve this problem, 
the bathrooms will be moved to the right, 
with new student lounges for each floor 
taking their place.
According to Michael, as of now the 
only lounges that exist in Scobell are 
student rooms at the end of each hall≠
way that have been designated as pub≠
lic space for the floor. The problem, 
however, is that while these rooms 
may be convenient for those students 
who live close by, the people on the 
other end do not get the same benefit. 
By moving the lounges to the middle of
the floor, Housing hopes to better serve 
all of the residents.
Some of the additional work on Scobell 
includes moving one of the exterior fire 
staircases inside to increase circula≠
tion, making the first floor handicap 
accessible, and adding a new recreation 
room to the ground floor. In addition, 
the new ground floor will also contain a 
new laundry room with more machines, 
full kitchen facilities, and an expanded 
vending area.
Myers said that the decision to reno≠
vate Scobell, which is part of a 10-year 
master plan to improve the facilities on 
campus, was based on factors such as 
the number of work orders placed, and 
serious mechanical problems such as 
the shortage of electrical power.
In addition, Scobell was chosen for 
renovation because it is primarily an 
area for first-year students. According 
to Michael, Housing Services considers 
first-year student areas to have the great≠
est need for improvement because of the 
requirement for all first-year students 
to live in campus housing. ìPeople with≠
out choice should not be required to live 
in the worst buildings,î he said.
He also said that while it is impossible 
to make every building perfect, the best 
that Housing Services can do is to im≠
prove campus housing on a building-by- 
building basis. ìOf course one building 
must always be the oldest and the worst, 
but we think we raised the bottom level,î 
he said.
In an effort to continue improving cam≠
pus living, Housing Services has a num≠
ber of other plans for the coming sum≠
mer. These changes include upgrading 
Hamerschlag Houseís B-Tower in the 
same way that A-Tower was enhanced 
last summer, which included new car≠
peting, lighting, furniture, and paint≠
ing. Also, there will be some external 
brickwork done on Resnik and West 
Wing to solve some water leakage prob≠
lems, the slate replacement of the 
Morewood Gardens roof will enter its 
second phase, and electronic locks will

Haitian refugees die 
in two-boat disaster
MIAMI (AP) ó Two boats carrying 
as many as 43 Haitians in an apparent 
bid to smuggle them into the United 
States sank Saturday off the South 
Florida coast, and rescuers found only 
three survivors.
The three men rescued in the choppy 
Atlantic waters off West Palm Beach 
told U.S. Border Patrol officers that 
one boat ó carrying 18 Haitians ó 
broke down and that the other boató . 
carrying between 18 to 25 more people 
ió approached it to help. Both boats 
then went under, the survivors said.
ìForty are presumed dead or 
drowned,î said Art Bullock, a border 
patrol officer in West Palm Beach.
The Coast Guard planned to con≠
tinue its search for survivors until 
midnight, at which time the situation 
was to be re-evaluated.
The sinkings became known at about 
2 am, when crew members on a pass≠
ing freighter reported hearing screams 
from the water about 30 miles east of 
West Palm Beach.
A Coast Guard cutter recovered the 
bodies of two men, and crew members 
saw two other menís bodies sink below 
the surface.
ìItís a lot of people,î Coast Guard 
spokesman Lt. Ron LaBrec said. ìWe 
will keep searching until exhausting 
all hope to find people alive.î
A helicopter located the first survi≠
vor at 5 am and took him to a medical 
center in West Palm Beach, where he 
was in stable condition hours later. 
Two other men were rescued at 8:30 
am, clinging to a barrel. They were 
taken to the Border Patrol office in 
West Palm Beach, Bullock said.
None of the men were wearing life 
jackets and it was believed they were 
trying to sneak into the country, offi≠
cials said.
ìGenerally that many people donít 
get on a boat to cross in the middle of
the night,î said Petty Officer Jeff Hall. 
ìFrom what weíve seen in the past, 
they generally leave from the west end 
of the Bahamas and come across into 
West Palm Beach.î
The Coast Guard searched for oth≠
ers in the waters between Florida and 
the Bahamas with boats, two helicop≠
ters, and a Falcon jet.
The two vessels that sank, a 17-foot 
boat and a 20-foot boat, apparently 
casted off from the Bahamas, said 
Samedi Florvil, of the Haitian Refu≠
gee Center in Miami.
ìIn the Bahamas, [smugglers] tell 
them it is easy over here,î he said. 
ìSome of them pay $2,000 or $3,000 to 
get on a boat.î
The numbers of Haitians and Cu≠
bans taking to the seas rose in 1998, 
and authorities say they expect the 
trend to continue in 1999. In 1998, 
Coast Guard vessels intercepted 1,025 
Cubans and 1,206 Haitians at sea, 
compared with 406 Cubans and 587 
Haitians in 1997.
On Dec. 17, a 29-foot boat capsized 
in 6-foot high seas off Elliott Key, 
some 22 miles south of Miami. Nine 
Cubans drowned and another five were 
lost at sea and presumed dead. Two of 
the nine survivors are charged with 
smuggling the others.
ìIt just reiterates the danger thatís 
involved in smuggling migrants to the 
United States,î LaBrec said. ìThese 
people leave in small boats that are 
generally unseaworthy, overcrowded, 
and lacking in even the most basic 
safety gear.î
Haitians who pay smugglers to take 
them to the United States know the 
risk they are taking, said Fernand 
Phillip, vice president of the board of 
Miamiís Haitian Refugee Center.
ìThey are aware of the danger, but 
they are dying where they are,î Phillip 
said. ìTheyíre just looking to survive.î
Film director dies 
in U.K. at old age
LONDON (AP) ó Stanley Kubrick, 
the director of ì2001: A Space Odysseyî 
and ìA Clockwork Orange,î whose films 
often puzzled and shocked audiences 
only to end up as classics, died Sunday 
at his home in England, his family said. 
He was 70.
Police were summoned to Kubrickís 
rural home north of London on Sunday 
afternoon, said authorities in 
Hertfordshire, where he was certified 
dead. ìThere are no suspicious circum≠
stances,î police said. Kubrickís family 
announced his death, and said there 
would be no further comment.
Kubrickís films included ìSpartacusî 
in 1960, ìLolitaî in 1962, ìDr. 
Strangelove,î in 1964, ì2001î in 1968 
and ìA Clockwork Orangeî in 1971.
He also made ìThe Shiningî in 1980 
and ìFull Metal Jacketî in 1987. Malcolm
McDowell, who starred in ìA Clock≠
work Orange,î issued a statement 
through his publicist calling Kubrick ìa 
heavyweight of my life.î
ìHe was the last great director of 
that era. He was the big daddy,î 
said McDowell.
Kubrickís latest film, ìEyes Wide 
Shut,î is still slated for release on July 
16, Warner Bros, said Sunday. Tom 
Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in the 
story of jealousy and obsession.
Details about funeral arrangements 
were not immediately available.
Protesters battle 
Gap sweatshops
NEW YORK (AP) ó Protesters across 
the country demonstrated Saturday out≠
side stores they say sell clothing made in 
sweatshop conditions.
In San Francisco, as many as 300 
activists crowded in front of the Gap 
flagship store in the busy downtown 
shopping district. Police arrested 16 
after they blocked a doorway to the store, 
said Capt. Dennis Martel.
Several hundred activists marched up 
Manhattanís Fifth Avenue in the rain.
ìWe donít want clothes made in 
sweatshops,î said a sign hoisted over a 
sea of umbrellas.
The Gap has been charged with hav≠
ing its clothes manufactured with 
indentured labor, mostly young Asian 
women working on the U.S. island 
of Saipan.
Class-action lawsuits filed in January 
in California by human rights groups 
claim Saipan workers face beatings, 
forced abortions, vermin-infested 
quarters, and armed guards ó all while 
making clothing tagged ìMade in 
the USA.î
In a statement, Gap company offi≠
cials said they were ìdeeply concerned 
by the allegations in the lawsuits. We 
simply do not, and will not, tolerate the 
type of conduct alleged in factories 
where we do business.î
Protester Emma Berkman, a bicycle 
messenger, says she no longer buys cloth≠
ing ìunless it says itís union-made. You 
canít trust anybody otherwise.î
The New York rally ended in front of 
the Nike store on East 57th Street. The 
Nike corporation insists it is now moni≠
toring factories in Asiawhere critics say 
miserably paid workers have suffered 
conditions that include physical abuse. 
Other anti-Gap protests happened in 
front of Northern California stores in 
Berkeley, Fresno, Santa Monica and 
Santa Barbara.
U.S. identifies old 
World War bodies
WASHINGTON (AP) ó The remains 
of three American servicemen missing 
in action from World War II have been 
identified and are being returned to their 
families in the United States for burial, 
the Pentagon said Friday.
The three were identified as Maj. 
Frank H. Blakey, Millbrook, Ala.; 2nd 
Lt. John S. McConnon, Pittsburgh; and 
Tech. Sgt. Wayne O. Shaffner, 
Martinsville, 111.
McConnon and Shaffner were crew 
members aboard a B-24 Liberator shot
down by German anti-aircraft fire in 
Albania on Aug. 10, 1944. The plane 
was returning to a base in Italy after a 
bombing over Romania when it came 
under attack.
Blakey was commanding officer of the 
305th Airdrome Squadron near Aitape, 
New Guinea. He was last seen driving a 
jeep on June 10, 1944. The area ó now 
part of Papua New Guinea ó was under 
Japanese control at the time.
The remains of the three servicemen 
were sent to the U.S. military identifica≠
tion lab in Hawaii, which officially con≠
firmed the identities.
About 78,000 U.S. military personnel 
who fought in World War II are still 
missing. Most are believed to have per≠
ished at sea.
Pittsburgh player 
commits forgery
MONACA, Penn. (AP) ó Mike 
Webster, the Pittsburgh Steelers center 
who was elected to the NFL Hall of 
Fame, has been accused of forging pre≠
scriptions at another pharmacy.
Webster, who was charged last 
week with forgery at a pharmacy in 
Rochester, was charged Tuesday with 
presenting bogus prescriptions 
for Ritalin at three pharmacies in Cen≠
ter Township, about 25 miles northwest 
of Pittsburgh.
Webster, 46, lives in the township.
He retired from the Kansas City 
Chiefs in 1990 after winning four Su≠
per Bowl rings with the Steelers. Since 
then, his troubles have included a failed 
marriage, brief homelessness, and ill≠
ness. Webster said he had minor heart 
attacks, depression, and post-concus≠
sion syndrome.
Ritalin is used to treat hyperactivity, 
and police said it can be abused as 
a stimulant. Township police Officer 
Jeffrey Stone alleged that Webster íob≠
tained it .18 times at the Med-Fast Phar≠
macy, Wal-Mart, and CVS.
The prescriptions bore the name of Dr. 
Jerry Carter of Allegheny General Hos≠
pital in Pittsburgh, but Carter told po≠
lice he did not write them.Former U.S. Senator arbitrates deal with ethnic Albanians
LONDON (AP)óAll factions of 
the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo 
have promised to sign a peace plan 
Sunday to give them autonomy, 
the Clinton administration said. 
The pledge, if carried out, would 
intensify pressure on the Serbs to 
sign or face NATO airstrikes.
Former senator Bob Dole, who 
negotiated the agreement at the 
request of President Clinton, told 
Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright on Saturday he was con≠
fident Kosovoís Albanians would 
follow through.
That would leave the Serbsí 
refusal to accept NATOís peace≠
keeping role as the main stum≠
bling block when peace talks re≠
sume March 15.
ìThey promised us they would 
do it tomorrow,î Dole said at a 
news conference at the U.S. em≠
bassy. ìThey indicated to us many 
times that they will keep their
word.... That means, from that 
moment on, the pressure will be 
on (Yugoslav) President Slobodan 
Milosevic to do the same,î
Christopher Hill, the U.S. am≠
bassador to Macedonia and a key 
negotiator, planned to travel Sun≠
day to Pristina, the provincial 
capital of Kosovo, to see whether 
leaders of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army (KLA) would approve the 
peace plan.
KLA guerilla leaders have 
been holdouts, refusing to end 
their year-long fight for inde≠
pendence from Serbia, the larg≠
est of two remaining Yugoslav 
states. The population of 
Kosovo, a Serb province, is 90 
percent Albanian.
Jakup Krasniqi, a KLA spokes≠
man, told Dole in two separate 
telephone calls Friday that lead≠
ers of the guerilla army were 
ready to meet Sunday, when they
were expected to approve the 
plan, Dole said.
ìI think they at the KLA under≠
stand that they still can have a 
role in the future of Kosovo, a 
political future, a police force, or 
whatever,î Dole said.
Kosovoís Albanian political 
leaders, who saw Dole in Skopje, 
Macedonia, on Friday agreed 
in principle to sign during 
talks at Rambouillet, France. 
Those negotiations ended incon≠
clusively two weeks ago without 
Serbian agreement.
Hill was more cautious than 
Dole, leaving open the chance the 
KLA might need more time. Dole, 
too, acknowledged the possibility 
of a last-minute ìglitch.î
Similarly, one senior ethnic 
Albanian leader, Fehmi Agani, 
said Saturday in Kosovo: 
ìThe only thing I know is 
that maybe the KLA will an-
nounce acceptance of the 
Rambouillet agreement.î
Still, at the joint news confer≠
ence with Dole, Hill declared, ìWe 
expect all the groups represented 
on that (Rambouillet) delegation 
will agree.î
Also optimistic was British For≠
eign Secretary Robin Cook. After 
speaking with Albright, he said 
he welcomed the movement and 
support for the accord, opening 
ìthe way to progress in the next 
round of talks.î
The KLA would have to dis≠
arm under NATOís protective 
watch, which is the most diffi≠
cult concession, Dole said. Serb 
military troops and police also 
must withdraw.
Dole and Hill did not meet with 
Hashim Thaqi, a senior KLA 
commander who headed the eth≠
nic Albaniansí negotiating team 
at Rambouillet, because they
could not find him. But they said 
other KLA leaders could approve 
the deal.
Serb atrocities in quelling 
the rebellion, during which 
some 2,000 people have died, 
have led to joint peacemaking 
efforts by the United States, Brit≠
ain, Russia, Germany, France, 
and Italy.
If the ethnic Albanians sign the 
accord, attention would shift to 
getting Serb agreement.
The Serbs face the threat of 
NATO airstrikes if they refuse and 
if they continue a military buildup.
So far, the Serbs have accepted 
most of the political aspects of 
the peace plan to give broad self- 
rule to Kosovo for the next three 
years; the provinceís future would 
be decided later.
But Milosevic has rejected al≠
lowing a 30,000-member, NATO- 
led peacekeeping force to police
the deal. The force would include 
4,000 Americans.
ìThis is a package, and a 
NATO-led force is part of the 
package,î Hill said. ìOnce we get 
the Albanians on board we will 
work very hard to get the Serbs 
on board.... We think the Serbs 
can be brought around.î
European diplomats and possi≠
bly U.S. diplomat Richard 
Holbrooke are expected to 
travel to Belgrade for tough 
talks this week to overcome 
Milosevicís objections.
Meanwhile, Albright and Dole 
met with Gen. Wesley Clark, 
supreme allied commander 
of NATO, to discuss, plans 
for both peacekeeping and 
for airstrikes.
On her way home from a 
weeklong Asian trip Albright 
made an unscheduled stop in 
London to assess the situation.

50 YEARS AGO, March 2, 
1949 ó WCIT, Carnegie Techís 
campus radio station, announced 
that it would have to cancel all 
broadcast activities for the rest of 
the year.
Difficulties that the station 
faced included frequency inter≠
ference with other stations, and 
lack of space for the station. If 
and when the radio station 
would go back online, the 11- 
man staff would have to be sig≠
nificantly increased.
25 YEARS AGO, March 4, 
1974 ó Students staged a dem≠
onstration outside of Warner Hall 
to protest the Universityís tenure 
policies.
Three faculty members had re≠
cently been dismissed, which 
caused the demonstration. Stu≠
dents asked onlookers to sign a
petition calling for student voice 
in tenure issues.
In response to the petition, 
which garnered 300 signatures, 
President Richard Cyert agreed 
to meet with an H&SS student 
advisory later that week to dis≠
cuss grievances.

students, were drunk, started 
to verbally harass the three 
PiLam brothers.
One of the strangers threw a 
wrench, striking a PiLam brother 
in the face.
Unfortunately, the assailants

shuffled their locations. WRCT- 
FM found a new home in the 
Margaret Morrison Plaza.
As a result, CMUís radio sta≠
tion would gain needed space, 
but at the expense of the Caber 
Club, a University health club, 
which had been in operation for
12 years.
The radio station budgeted 
$75,000 for renovations, which 
would include building walls for 
studios and creating an office out 
of old locker rooms.
In addition, Entropy, the Carn≠
egie Shoppe, the Art Store, and 
the Graduate Coffeehouse would 
move to the Printing and Publi≠
cations Building, in order to make 
way for the demolition of Skibo 
hall at the end of the school year.
ONE YEAR AGO, March 9,
1998 ó An unknown hacker sent 
information over the Internet, 
crashing CMU computers running 
Windows 95 and Windows NT.
Most of the computers in the 
Cyert cluster and many dorms 
were struck by the hacker, who 
used a program called Teardrop
2. The program sent a packet of 
information over the network that 
was too much for the receiving 
computer to handle.
The excessive information 
caused computers to freeze and 
display what is known as ìthe 
blue screen of death.î

Housing plans summer renovations
HOUSING, from page 1
be installed in all student rooms 
on campus. In addition, a three- 
year plan to renovate the entire 
fraternity quad will begin this 
summer with improvements to 
Kappa Sigma and Theta Xiís 
houses, which will cost about 
$850,000 each.
There is some question, how≠
ever, as to whether or not these 
changes are necessary, espe≠
cially considering that housing 
rates will be increasing by 3.3
percent next year. In response 
to these concerns, Myers said, 
ìWhile it is true that we are 
financially very healthy, prima≠
rily due to the efforts of Tim 
[Michael] and Dean Murphy, our 
job involves prioritizing needs 
for both the current year and 25 
years from now.î
ìCapital planning and annual 
investments in renovations and 
upgrades are critical to the long≠
term stability of housing and to 
student quality of life,î said
Michael Murphy, dean of Stu≠
dent Affairs. ìThe quality of our 
residence halls is not what it 
should be, as most students 
know, and this is reflected in a 
fair amount of deferred capital 
and maintenance. The current 
housing administration has 
been doing a great job of turn≠
ing this around, and capital 
projects are a considerable part 
of that.î
While these upgrades may 
provide for the stability of Hous-
ing for the future, they do little 
to address one of the largest 
problems regarding Housing on 
campus right now, namely, first- 
year students who must live in 
off-campus housing or in a hotel 
as temporary housing. ìThere 
is no question that renovations 
do not create new space for 
first-year students, but they do 
add to the quality of life for 
those students able to live on cam≠
pus, and that is also important,î 
said Murphy.
Vote will decide 
fate of PAT deal
BUSES, from page 1
and PAT will meet in Decem≠
ber to re-negotiate the price of 
the deal for January.
Faculty and staff would be 
paid for through a benefits pool 
already set up.
ìIt is important for students 
to know that they are not pay≠
ing and covering the full cost of 
the agreement.... They are cov≠
ering the portion of the agree≠
ment that students represent 
by head count,î said Murphy.
The resolution to conduct the 
referendum was passed by both 
Student Senate and GSA 
(Graduate Student Assembly) 
last week. GSA will mass-email 
graduate students March 15- 
19 asking them to vote yes or no 
on the agreement. Similarly, 
Student Senate will set up a 
table for undergraduates to vote 
between March 16-18.
ìWeíre hoping to get a good 
turnout so we have an idea of 
what the student body wants,î 
said Sarah Gross, president 
of the student body and junior 
history major. Gross also said 
that before the referendum, 
there will be a town meeting 
open to the whole student 
body. The main topic of dis≠
cussion at the meeting will be 
the PAT deal.
The referendum is non-bind≠
ing, which means that the out≠
come of the referendum will 
not necessarily dictate whether 
or not the deal between CMU 
and PAT is made.
ìA referendum is not techni≠
cally necessary, but I feel it is 
critical to allow all students a 
chance to have their opinion 
registered.... I want to make 
sure students agree before we
impose such a fee,î said Murphy
Murphy and Charles An the, 
chair of Student Senate and se≠
nior in electrical and computer 
engineering, said that it is impor≠
tant to conduct the referendum 
before spring break, because the 
PAT board will most likely meet 
in late March to vote on the deal.
ìThe president and board of 
trustees have already endorsed 
this agreement,î said Gross. ìBy 
supporting the referendum, 
youíre saying that you want it for 
five years.î
According to Gross and others, 
the deal would open up several 
opportunities for students. For 
example, resident assistants 
would be able to make plans 
within the city without worrying 
about bus fare for students. In 
addition, the agreement would 
alleviate parking problems and 
be more environmentally sound 
than driving a car.
Murphy and Gross both said 
that the new deal will not affect 
the current escort service. 
ìThere is no reason to stop do≠
ing it unless no one is using it,î 
said Gross.
ìNot all students realize the 
huge availability this [deal] will 
provide,î said Anthe, adding that 
a monthly PAT pass costs $40. 
The possibility of offering dis≠
count passes to all students in≠
stead of the current agreement 
was also looked into. ìItís an ex≠
cellent alternative, but itís not 
realistic. It would be difficult to 
implement,î said Anthe.
Murphy said that he hopes that 
the referendum will pass among 
the student body. ìI am excited 
about the potential it creates to 
open up the Pittsburgh commu≠
nity to our students,î he said.Internal conflicts plague Student Senateís daily operations

resign, which would have made us un≠
productive for the rest of the semester.î
ì[Moskowitz] impeded upon the for≠
ward efforts of myself [sic] ... with his 
micromanaging techniques,î said 
Rothschild. He also cited the recent re≠
port of the Committee to Investigate the 
Actions of the Treasurer as incomplete. 
The report absolved Rothschild of any 
apparent wrongdoing, and did not rec≠
ommend to Senate that any action be 
taken against him.
ìThough it vindicated me personally, 
it was very painful to see how incom≠
plete and error-filled [the report] was,î 
Rothschild said.
In his official resignation, Markle al≠
leged that Moskowitz used funds inappro≠
priately. Much of the discontent expressed 
about Moskowitzís conduct stemmedfrom 
the purchase of a $1,000 printer ó a 
purchase made by Moskowitz without 
Student Senateís full approval. He said he 
didnít know of the problems, either with 
the printer or with miscommunications 
within the executive committee. He said 
that more than anything else, his resigna≠
tion stemmed from his ailing personal 
relationships with both Markle and 
Rothschild ó friendships getting in the 
way of a political working relationship.
ìThere are a lot of personal problems 
that [Rothschild and Markle] have 
brought to Senate,î said Moskowitz. ìAnd 
that was getting in the way ó affecting 
professional decisions that were being
carried out.... They wanted to make it 
seem like there were bigger problems 
than there actually were.î
Moskowitz said that his attempts to 
communicate with Gross, Rothschild, 
and Markle went unheard. Gross and 
Rothschild still contend that Moskowitz 
did not allow their opinions to be heard 
in meetings or discussions.
Markle said, ìI felt that the Chair was 
leadingSenate, and ExComm specifically, 
in a dictatorial manner, giving little or no 
thought to the opinions and criticisms 
expressed by other executive members.î 
For Senators, though, much of the con≠
flict leading up to these resignations per≠
tained primarily to the executive com≠
mittee. Marcin Jeske, a sophomore Sena- 
tor-At-Large for SCS, said that he thought
the recent situation was indicative of 
general communication problems, and a 
hinderance to external Senate business.
ìA lot of the inter-fighting has been 
slowing down Senate,î Jeske said. ìIn 
the last meeting, without all of that, it 
went much faster. Before we couldnít go 
ahead and do what we needed to do. I 
think we lost a lot of people who were 
doing a very good job.... Because Senate 
already has a problem with having 
enough people to be active, itís bad to 
lose another three [people].î
Senate is still trying to re-order itself 
in light of the recent changes. An amend≠
ment to clarify how officials are elected 
internally was recently brought up for 
discussion. In Grossís view, despite all 
the time it consumes, this reordering is
a necessary step. Timing-wise, though, 
this recent upheaval may make it hard 
for Senate to settle down.
ìThe purpose of Student Government 
is to improve life on campusórepresent 
our constitutents,î she said. ìBut before 
we can be helpful to other people we 
have to stabilize within Student Gov≠
ernment. Itís just hard, because now 
that weíve stabilized, weíll be having 
elections in a month.î
Gross said she is optimistic about the 
rest of the semester.ìWe have a really 
stable group of people working now,î she. 
said. ìOther things that could have been 
done were slowed down, but Senate has 
gotten itself into good order now, and 
hopefully more things will get done over 
the semester.î
Crime and Incident Report
3/1 THEFT, 9:47 am ó A fac≠
ulty member in CFA called Cam≠
pus Police to report that someone 
had stolen his copy of Michael 
Jacksonís Off the Wall. He told 
the responding officer that his 
CDs had been disappearing fre≠
quently over the past few months. 
His office is always locked, and 
the thefts always occur overnight. 
He told the officer that things 
have been stolen from his bossís 
office, too. Once, someone stole 
his liquor and wine and replaced 
it with water. Other times, food 
had been taken.
3/1 RETAIL THEFT, 1:21 pm 
Entropyís senior sales associate 
called Campus Police to report 
a theft in progress. She had seen 
a white male with brown pants 
hide candy under his gray 
jacket. When three officers ar≠
rived at the UC store, she 
pointed to a young man in the 
center aisle.
One of the officers introduced 
himself to the actor and said he 
needed to speak with him about 
the items that he had concealed 
under his coat. The actor said, ìI 
didnít have any money to pay for 
these,î opened his coat, and let 
nine packages of Reeseís Pieces 
candy fall to the floor. The offic≠
ers asked the actor for identifica≠
tion; he gave them a Central 
Catholic High School ID.
The officer told the actor that 
he wasnít under arrest but that 
he would be given a state citation 
for retail theft. The officer then 
searched his bag for more mer≠
chandise but found nothing else. 
The officers escorted the actor to 
the Campus Police office. The 
boyís father was contacted in or≠
der to pick him up.
3/2 DOMESTIC, 12:10 am ó 
A Morewood Gardens resident 
went to a friendís house. They 
had had trouble before because 
he wanted to be her boyfriend, 
but she wanted to remain just 
friends. That evening they had 
an argument over when she would 
leave. She wanted to go at 11:00 
pm, but he wanted her to stay 
until 1:00 am. She fell asleep on 
his bed, however, and didnít wake 
up until after midnight.
She missed the last city bus of 
the night, and he called a cab for 
her. Against her wishes, he joined 
her for the ride back to CMU. 
When they got to Forbes and 
Morewood, she exited the cab. 
Again, against her wishes, he, 
too, got out of the cab. He told her 
that he simply wanted to make 
sure she got home safely. At this 
point, she grew very uncomfort≠
able and ran off to the UC. Seeing 
that she was upset, he chased 
after her. Once inside the UC, 
she ran into a womenís restroom,
saying that she would not leave 
the restroom until he left the area.
A male saw the chase and called 
Campus Police. Three officers and 
two security guards responded to 
the scene. They saw a male match≠
ing the callerís description and 
asked him about the situation. He 
gave them his version of the story. 
Another officer talked to the fe≠
male and gave her options to con≠
sider, including working through 
Student Life orthrough legal chan≠
nels. She said she wasnít sure what 
to do. An officer gave her a ride 
back to her dormitory. The male 
was issued an internal citation for 
disorderly conduct. He refused a 
ride home, saying heíd prefer to 
walk and ìblow off some steam.î

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University8 March 1999
Student Senate must 
improve its efficiency
Student Senate exists to serve 
the undergraduate student body. 
But while some beneficial projects, 
such as the Morewood basement 
renovation, have continued to 
progress, Senate has been caught 
up in resolving its own internal 
problems for much of the semester. 
A number of executive positions 
have not been consistently filled, 
and inefficiencies associated with 
Senateís operational structure have 
caused meetings to last far longer 
than necessary, causing fewer ben≠
eficial actions to be taken. Senate 
cannot allow such problems to con≠
tinue to interfere with its primaiy 
purpose of serving students.
Student Senateís meetings oper≠
ate under Robertís Rules of Order, 
a rigorous set of guidelines de≠
signed to create a structured envi≠
ronment for parliamentary debate. 
While some structure is clearly 
needed in order for a governing 
body to carry out its tasks, Robertís 
Rules make it easy for confusion 
among Senators to arise. The rules 
allow motions upon motions ad 
infinitum and leave open the pos≠
sibility for Senateís eveiy action 
ó even simple ones such as end≠
ing a meetingóto be voted upon. 
Some Senators have insisted that 
Robertís Rules be followed strictly, 
causing excessive amounts of time 
to be spent discussing what is go≠
ing on at the moment and whether 
or not certain actions are allowed, 
rather than concentrating on the 
issue at hand. Senate should adopt 
a simpler version of Robertís Rules 
which will allow the organization 
to operate more efficiently and
move forward more quickly with 
business whichis directly relevant 
to the student body. Senators 
should also make a conscious ef≠
fort to engage in efficient discus≠
sion and to focus on serving stu≠
dents, rather than squabbling over 
who said what.
Senate must also be able to con≠
tinue operating if key positions 
are vacant, and Senators who take 
on such roles must be prepared to 
fulfill their duties. At the start of 
this semester, the Senate Chair 
position and two standing com≠
mittee chair positions were un≠
filled, bringing Senate to a stand≠
still until new executives could be 
found. Most recently, the Student 
Body Treasurer, Senate Chair, 
and Funding and Recognition 
(F&R) committee chair all re≠
signed from their positions; each 
citied personal differences as part 
of their reasons for resigning. In 
addition to impeding progress on 
issues of greater importance to 
students, these resignations set 
a poor example for the rest of 
Senateóthat people should just 
quit rather than trying to resolve 
their differences and work to≠
gether to fix problems.
Student Senate has the potential 
to accomplish many good things for 
the undergraduate student body, 
but this potential is getting lost 
amongintemal conflicts and ineffi≠
ciencies. While itís important to 
discuss issues, vote, and operate in 
a structured manner, Senators 
must work together effectively and 
efficiently to meet their common 
goal ó to serve their constituents.

Poor publicity ruins good 
interdisciplinary idea
The Wats:on? Festival for the 
Arts is an annual event sponsored 
by the College of Fine Arts (CFA) 
in honor of architect, alumna, and 
adjunct faculty member Jill 
Watsonís diverse artistic interests. 
The purpose of the festival is to 
bring the community together and 
promote interaction among the 
schools within CFA. A shorter ver≠
sion of the festival will be held this 
semester; a second one, which will 
include a student competition for 
interdisciplinary projects, is 
planned for this fall. This new 
element is a strong step toward 
the festivalís goal of fostering in≠
teraction among disciplines, but it 
has fallen victim to poor publicity.
The competition is open to all 
students enrolled in the fall 1999 
semester, both within and outside 
CFA. Teams consist of two or more 
people representing at least two 
disciplines, including at least one 
in CFA or the Humanities and Arts 
program. The design of the contest 
clearly promotes interdisciplinary 
projects in the aits; however, aside 
from a few posters and a brief men≠
tion over email, little was done to 
promote the contest.
The festival as a whole also suf≠
fers from inadequate promotion, 
especially among students not in 
CFA. Only CFAstudentshavetheir 
classes canceled for the entire festi≠
val. Since many of the events dur- 
ingthe Wats:on? Festival are sched≠
uled during the day, it is difficult 
for students outside of CFA to at≠
tend them without skipping classes.
If the intent of the festival is truly 
to extend interdisciplinary inter≠
actions to the entire campus, all 
students should be given an equal 
opportunity to attend.
While it was a good move for CFA 
to open the Watsron? Festival to 
other students, and push it toward 
a more interdisciplinary event 
than previous years, all students 
need to be aware of its existence. 
And that means CFA needs to im≠
prove publicity and advertising for 
the event and contest. Seeking sup≠
port from professors of CFA and 
related interdisciplinary courses 
would go a long way towards gen≠
erating interest and submissions. 
Professors could mention the con≠
test to their students, as well as 
help them come up with and refine 
project proposals.
In addition, students should be 
given more time to consider and 
submit proposals. The deadline for 
proposals is March 8 ó today ó 
only about a week after the post≠
ers went up. This short time frame 
left students with little opportu≠
nity to formulate and submit ideas.
The Wats:on? festival, and the 
student competition in particular, 
is another example of an opportu≠
nity to foster interdisciplinary work 
at CMU whose potential has not 
yet been realized. With more effort 
on the part of the organizers to 
bring in students from all colleges, 
the festival and contest could fulfill 
their goal of fostering interaction 
among the schools in CFA and 
across all departments at CMU.

the Editor
Job Fair, lamentingthe lack ofresources 
devoted to humanities students. The 
column, highly critical, evinced some 
valid concerns, but also risks 
counterproductivity ó which is why, 
against my usual policy, I venture a 
brief comment.
Itís developing into an annual ritual: 
We hold a job fair, it goes a little better 
than the previous year, and then we get 
publicly trounced. The result is an 
imbalanced impression that actually 
makes it harder to improve faster.
As the column notes, and in case any 
readers have been asleep for the last 
couple of years, CMU is well-known for 
its technical prowess, and this unques≠
tionably affects recruiter interests. In 
fact, liberal arts recruiters nationally 
are less aggressive than technical folks; 
itís not just a local problem. Each year 
we get a few more employers ó progress 
is real, but incremental. Each year we 
get many favorable comments from stu≠
dents who come: ìOverall the experience 
was very worthwhile and excellently or≠
ganizedî; ìIt was valuable for me to see 
what opportunities there areî; ìgood 
career and academic informationî; 
ìrather small, but well focused on hu≠
manitiesî; ìless stressful than the TOC, 
[I was] better able to talk with people 
and navigate the room.î
Sweeping criticisms risk draining the 
baby with the bathwater. We actually 
need more students to attend, to make it 
worth employersí while; each year, stu≠
dent attendance has been down. Despite 
the fact that the job fair is not as glorious 
as we all would like, letís not defeat it
with excessive criticism; letís focus on 
useful targets, not venting. Students 
who want to help us do a better job could 
actually assist, by extending contacts to 
more employers. We will work hard in 
the same direction.

Parking situation

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I am a graduate stu≠
dent at this University. 
I commute 40 miles to 
get here. I then com≠
mute 40 more miles to 
seek a parking space. There is no bus. I 
have to drive ó ergo, I have to park. The 
administration is playing fast and loose 
with our tuition money when they sched≠
ule film crews at the same time as con≠
struction workers. When the adminis≠
tration takes our tuition money, isnít 
there some kind of expectation that they 
will not make it impossible for com≠
muter students to attend classes? 
Wouldnít that be kind of dishonest?
Adding insult to injury, less than half 
the parking spaces reserved from Feb≠
ruary 18 through February 23 were used 
by the film crew. One morning, in order 
to get parking and attend my 1:30 pm 
class, I had to drive in at 6 am and sleep 
in my car for four hours. It was very cold. 
It was very uncomfortable. And I am 
paying a lot of money for this privilege.
I realize the robber baron mentality 
may have its good points ó mainly in 
their favor ó however, this administra≠
tion has saddled many of us with such a 
parking nightmare that the education 
we have paid for is being jeopardized.
As soon as I get out of school and 
become a capitalist pig myself, Iím going
to buy all the parking streets around 
and give free parking to all commuting 
students. Iíll make the administrators 
perform feats of valor and/or squalor 
before letting them anywhere near the 
parking spaces reserved for paying cus≠
tomers rather than paid customers.

tion is not defensible as an acceptable 
practice in terms of murder. Rather, it is 
the fact that in a free democratic society, 
a person has the right to his or her own 
body. A woman has dominion over her 
body, and justly should. A fetus ó a part 
of her body ó cannot make any claim to 
the life in which it is contained. As a 
growth in the body of a woman, a fetus 
can claim no right to the life of the 
mother. It is there by choice and condi≠
tion of the mother. As such, the mother 
has the choice whether to allow the 
growth to continue, or to remove that 
growth from her body. The state does 
not have a moral right to claim dominion 
over her body and force her to go through 
the pain of childbirth and the burden of 
raising a child. It is for this reason that 
people have dominion over their own 
bodies, that pro-choice is the moral op≠
tion for society, not because murder is 
an acceptable practice.

If youíve got $5,000 and 
nothing to do this weekend, 
why not make an appoint≠
ment with your local 
cosmetic surgeon? Thatís 
right, for just $5,000, you 
could drive to your local cos≠
metic practice and pick up 
two new breasts. Even bet≠
ter, it only takes two hours. 
The new, perfectly silicone, 
drive-thru you. But make 
sure you read the very small 
print at the bottom of the in≠
formed consent form. You 
may find that this procedure, 
surprisingly enough, does 
not guarantee newfound 
self-esteem.
Although neither of the pro- 
fessional surgeons that I 
talked to would give me all the 
bloody details, the actual sur≠
gical procedure sounds pretty
simple. Here is a hypotheti≠
cal breast implant situation: 
You are a B-cup. You make 
an appointment. You bring a 
picture of your boyfriendís or 
your own favorite Playboy 
model. The surgeon tells you 
that you donít have the frame 
to carry double-Ds. You sched≠
ule the surgery anyway. The 
surgeon inserts the implants 
underneath the breasts. (If 
the implants are large they 
must be inserted under the 
breast, otherwise they may 
be inserted through the 
nipple.) Two hours later, you 
emerge with your new double- 
D Playboy breasts. You are a 
little sore, a little uncomfort≠
able. The surgeon utters 
something about a scar. You 
look fantastically dispropor≠
tionate. Call Jerry Springer.
When I spoke with a cos≠
metic surgeon working for a 
practice in the South Hills, I 
was told that breast implants 
are the most common cosmetic 
surgery that they perform. 
Ladies, it looks like standards
are going up 
more rapidly 
than you think.
They do about 
1ó2 implants in 
the ìoff-seasonî 
and as many as 
10ó15 implants 
during the ìin- 
season.î The 
ìoff-seasonî 
usually in≠

time of year 
when women

lance, new threats exist in the 
world today ó rogue nations 
and terrorists, against which we 
are ill-prepared. New technolo≠
gies and weapons must devel≠
oped to meet these new threats, 
from wherever they may arise.î 
One of the costs in the budget is 
revitalized research into the 
Strategic Defense Initiative 
(SDI), the much-derided ìStar 
Warsî program pushed by 
former president Ronald 
Reagan. Now feasible with im≠
proved satellite and laser tech-
nology, it is being vigorously 
backed by military planners.
Like many liberals, I tend to 
chuckle at everything associated 
with former president Reagan. 
For instance, there is not one 
country today with whom we are 
not strongly allied that possesses 
the capability of launching inter≠
continental ballistic missiles 
(ICBMs) at us. Sure, there are 
some old Russian missiles on the 
black market, but no rogue coun≠
try is going to have the necessary 
technological infrastructure to 
successfully arm and launch one 
of those into orbit; theyíd be more 
likely to hit themselves. China? 
China has exactly 18 nuclear war≠
heads ó the United States has 
over a thousand. Not even a blip 
on the radar. Iím sorry, but we 
donít need SDI. What use could 
we possibly have for it? There is 
no Evil Empire anymore ó we 
are the Empire, ruled by a mas≠
sive bureaucracy, chasing down 
rebels and crushing them with 
overwhelming might. As youíll 
recall, the original point of SDI to 
was make America impervious to 
ICBM attack. Now we can launch 
ICBMs at Russia, but they canít 
hit us back. We win, right?
I wouldnít object to Republican 
plans for military funding if weíd
actually put it to good use, and in 
todayís world, thatís building an 
empire. Think America is really 
so great? Then take over other 
countries and let other people 
participate. The great American 
experiment begun over 200 years 
ago has been an astounding suc≠
cess. Weíre a prosperous, literate 
population, with the worldís high≠
est standard of living by far. 
Whatís keeping us from spread≠
ing this bounty across 
the world?
Itíd work if weíd just get it into 
our heads that America rules the 
world. People complain about us 
being a bully and ruling like an 
international police force ó well, 
thatís nothing. A simple example: 
We can hit North Korea with 
missiles, but they canít touch us. 
All we have to do is start exercis≠
ing American military might the 
way force is meant to be exer≠
cised ó not clothed in our chok≠
ing veil of politically correct no≠
tions of fighting for ìfreedom, 
democracy, and human rights.î 
Every country in the Middle East, 
at least, knows we donít believe 
in that any more than we believe 
in Allah.
The time for an imperialist, ex≠
pansionist America has come. We 
can establish colonies and force
trade agreements with any≠
one around the world.
Whoís going to stop us? The 
world community has 
proved that the most it can 
come up with are weak eco≠
nomic sanctions. Itís 
America thatís been exer≠
cising force, and America 
wonít be stopped by eco≠
nomic sanctions. Foreign 
currencies are measured in 
their strength against the 
dollar, and for good reason.
The world needs American 
stuff ó we are, by far, the 
largest producers of com≠
puters, airplanes, and la≠
sers. We produce so much 
food that the government 
pays farmers not to plant 
it all. Itís time for the coun≠
try to stop being afraid 
and cross that bridge to the 
21st century.
Just like in the Roman 
Empire, even if we muscle 
our way in at first, treating 
the people with the same 
dignity and giving them the same 
rights every American enjoys will 
result in a great, prosperous, and 
peaceful empire. We speak of un≠
derstanding other culturesóthis 
is the real way to break down 
barriers. Conquer, but do not sub-

Dave Liber
Once again that bastion of progressive 
thought known as the American South has 
decided to show just how liberal it can be by 
forbidding the sale of marital aids, which 
they have deemed to be immoral and im≠
proper, within the state of Alabama. For 
some unknown reason, the Alabama state 
legislature has decided that marital aids 
ó better known as sex toys ó have been 
the cause of moral turpitude within their 
state. Thus, this phallus-phobic legisla≠
ture has decided to enact laws that pro≠
hibit the sale of such items in their state.
This piece of legislation is the most igno≠
rant and ill-conceived bill to be presented 
;his year by any state legislatureóbut the 
year is still young, so who knows what will 
top this one? The idea that the sale of 
marital aids could be the moral downfall of 
any state is ridiculous, but this case is 
especially silly, because Alabama ranks 
near the very bottom of almost every list, 
including education, welfare, and employ≠
ment. I can think of many different rea≠
sons for the state of Alabama to suffer such 
a low ranking, but the sale of marital aids 
is not one of them. While I fully agree that
selling sex toys within the state bound≠
aries is not about to raise SAT scores, it 
certainly cannot hurt. This appears to be 
yet another example of the increasing 
attempts of a minority within this nation 
to impose itsreligious beliefs upon the 
majority of Americans in violation of the 
First Amendment of the Constitution.
Let us also note the hypocrisy of a state 
that undoubtedly seeks to preserve mar≠
riage, being a conservative and highly 
religious state, yet wants to prevent the 
sale of aids that would help the 44 per≠
cent of women and 31 percent of men 
that have sexual dysfunction. Surely it is 
not unreasonable to believe that a healthy 
and active sexual relationship would help 
keep more marriages together, thus ne≠
cessitating a need for the sale of such 
marital aids that have been proven to 
help in such cases. Yet the Alabama 
legislature seems less concerned with 
helping to preserve marriages and more 
concerned with regulating the actions of 
two informed, mature, and consenting 
adults. Let us not fool ourselves about' 
the real intent of this bill. These legisla≠
tors and their supporters are not really 
concerned with the sale of marital aids. 
Instead, they are perhaps so deeply bored, 
undersexed, and perverted that they 
must waste the time and money of Ala≠
bama taxpayers by regulating what two 
consenting adults may do in the privacy
of their own bedrooms. I would suggest 
that, if these legislators really were so 
deeply concerned with the sexual immo≠
rality of their state, they might also wish 
to regulate the sale of condoms, R-rated 
videos, and Viagra (although a sizable 
proportion of the Alabama legislature is 
probably taking that medication).
We in America are obsessed with sex; we 
live it, breathe it, and yearn for it. When 
we arenít having it we are thinking about 
it, and apparently, when we canít have it 
we are at least trying to prevent anyone 
else from having it either. Too often we 
wish to bring the government into our 
bedrooms to regulate what two or more 
consenting adults wish to do with their 
bodies. We are hypocrites of the highest 
degree, not only because we are so con≠
cerned about sex that we seek to regulate 
it, but also because we use arbitrary ex≠
cuses such as religion and morality to 
justify our obsession with sex. The recent 
impeachment of President Clinton just 
proves that our obsession with- sex is so 
high that we had to link it to everything 
about a trial that dealt with peijury and 
obstruction of justice and had nothing 
whatsoever to do with our Presidentís 
roaming hands.
It can never be stated enough that what 
two or more consenting adults wish to do 
in the privacy of their own home is their 
own business. Do we as a nation honestly
believe that at the age of 18 we can vote 
and fight for our country and at 21 we 
may legally consume alcohol, but at no 
time do we ever reach a proper age to 
engage in any sexual activity we may 
wish with another consenting adult? The 
government does not have the right to 
regulate such things, nor does it have the 
right to prevent informed consenting 
adults from purchasing aids to add to 
their enjoyment of sex and thus preserve 
domestic tranquility, as mentioned in the 
Preamble to the Constitution. This coun≠
try would surely be better served if we 
could finally stop watching and regulat≠
ing what our neighbors are doing in 
their homes and start watching what we 
are doing in our own. Is it honestly 
too much to ask that we find enough 
mutual respect for our fellow man to stop 
forcing our own moral, ethical, and reli≠
gious beliefs onto one another? 
Apparently, the Alabama state legisla≠
ture thinks so, as it seeks to prevent 
the sale of marital aids within 
state boundaries.

my thanks to those ìconserva≠

more concerned for their patientsí 
well-being than the size of their

lack thereof.)
I think that it is ridiculous 
that one can completely change

listen to Aquaís ìIím A Barbie

casm, but do we really believe 
that breast implants make us 
better in any way? Do they 
make us sexier? No ó your atti≠
tude makes you sexy. If Cindy 
Crawford had terrible posture, 
never smiled, wore frumpy 
clothing, and acted completely 
remedial, she would not be 
nearly the gem that she is. The
fact is, these practices take ad≠
vantage of womenís little hang≠
ups. I wish that a woman could 
completely rid herself of her 
bodily insecurities by buying 
herself a new pair of breasts, or 
getting a tummy tuck or 
liposuction. If this were true, I 
would be a strong advocate of 
cosmetic surgery ó Iíd probably 
even get it done myself. How≠
ever, you leave this surgery as 
the same person who went into
it. And if you arenít obsessing 
over how small your breasts are 
anymore, youíll find something 
new to obsess over.
Changing your appearance is 
a temporary solution to a 
deeper problem that cannot be 
resolved in two hours with five 
grand. Donít get me wrong; I am 
not saying that every woman 
who considers breast implants 
should rush to a therapist. Iím 
simply saying that, for most of
us, the great things about our≠
selves outshine the size of our 
breasts ó itís about the total 
package. Besides, if all the 
women in the world looked like 
a Playboy model, wouldnít the 
world would be boring? Guys ó

Spring 1999 Final Exam Schedule
Preamble
The Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of final examinations for the 
undergraduate courses (defined as courses that are numbered 6xx or below). These policies represent an 
understanding between faculty and students concerning an important but often stressful period at the 
conclusion of each academic semester. There should be no expectation that the following points will cover 
every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the end-of-semester schedule, 
plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize that the student is encumbered 
with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this period over which he or she has no 
control: expectations should be reasonably consistent with the number of course units and, of course, 
should be made known to the student well in advance of the final examination period.
Definitions
ï The universityís official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day 
of classes and continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of read≠
ing day(s).
ï Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by Enrollment Services. An instructor may choose 
not to fix a schedule for the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination 
time; such exams are called self-scheduled examinations.
ï Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, 
covering only a part of the course.
Policies
1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the universityís official final 
examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at 
the option of the department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days 
shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self-scheduled 
examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are 
allowed during this final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive exami≠
nation.
2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than 72 hours before the final examination 
in the course. In cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback 
should be provided unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been returned.
3. No other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final examination peri≠
od unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the courseís final examination. Regardless of whether 
there is a final examination in the course, no classes other than review sessions shall be held during the 
final examination period. Review sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious 
effort should be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In appreciation of the time required 
to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio reviews, critiques or juries shall be 
scheduled within four days of the final examination of the same course.
4. Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that people can leave 
earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading day or weekend preceding examina≠
tions.
5. No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start within a 24-hour period. 
A student who has more than two examinations scheduled within a 24-hour period or has two examina≠
tions scheduled at the same time should contact first the instructor of the course for assistance in resolv≠
ing conflicts. If the problem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate 
dean of his or her home college.
6. Take-home final examinations shall be given for any 24-hour period of the studentís choosing during the 
final examination period.
7. Students are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the examination; late 
arrival will reduce the total time a student has to complete the examination, unless instructorís course pol≠
icy indicates otherwise. Instructors reserve the right to require attendance within a specific time period. 
Students who miss an examination with a reasonable excuse and wish to petition for a make-up final 
examination should check with the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to include late arrival policy and 
make-up exam policy in the course syllabus.
8. Any student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final examination in the presence 
of an instructor or a teaching assistant. Any controversy arising from this review shall be dealt with in 
accordance with the university procedure for the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examina≠
tion which is not returned to a student will be kept available for a year for review. In the event that the 
instructor or teaching assistant is not available for the review, the responsibility shall rest with the depart≠
ment head of the instructor offering the course or his or her designee. Since instructors are expected to 
return all work assigned before the final examinations, they are not responsible for retaining unclaimed 
coursework.
9. Concerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final examination policy or 
alterations of the final examination schedule should be directed to the department head of the instructor 
offering the course or to the associate dean of the studentís home college.
Contact:
Questions concerning this policy or its intent should be directed to: Indira Nair, Vice Provost for Education 
X85865.

UAA honors 
Tartan women
The University Athletic Association 
released its Womenís All-Association 
Basketball Team last week and a num≠
ber of Tartan women received honors. 
Tartan forward/center junior 
Samantha Majernik was named to the 
second team for the second straight 
year. Majernik has been one of the 
teamís leading scorers for the past two 
years and is the teamís main physical 
presence down low.
In addition, junior Kara Coval and 
sophomore Lauren Petruzzi captured 
honorable mentions. The young 
Tartan team finished 11-14 on 
the season.
Swimmer earns 
trip to NCAAs
Junior Erin Rockwell has qualified 
for the NCAA Division III Swimming 
and Diving Championships in the 200- 
yard breaststroke. The College -of 
Wooster is hosting the meet at Miami 
University in Oxford, Ohio on 
March 11-13.
At the University Athletic Associa≠
tion (UAA) Championships at Emory 
University in Atlanta, Rockwell es≠
tablished a UAA and Carnegie Mellon 
record by winning the 200 breaststroke 
with a time of 2:25.37.
In addition, Rockwell took second 
place in the 100-yard breaststroke in a 
school record time of 1:07.35. In the 
200-yard individual medley, Rockwell, 
who owns or shares five school records, 
placed seventh in 2:15.50. She also 
swam on the 400-yard medley relay 
(third place, 4:02.42), 200-yard med≠
ley relay (fourth place, school record, 
1:51.15), and 800-yard freestyle relajr 
(second place, 7:55.43). Rockwell 
finished the meet with 49 individ≠
ual points.
In the team standings, the Tartans
earned their best finish since joining the 
UAA with 508 points, taking third place 
behind Emory University (973) and 
Johns Hopkins University (694).
Rockwell is the only member of the 
Carnegie Mellon squad to qualify for the 
national meet. She is a civil and environ≠
mental engineering major.

Two members of Carnegie Mellonís 
menís basketball team, senior mechani≠
cal engineering major Tommy Praesel 
and junior industrial management ma≠
jor Brad McNutt, have been named to 
the All-University Athletic Association 
(UAA) squad.
Praesel, who was named to the second 
team, averaged 14.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, 
and 3.0 assists per game. In UAA games, 
he ranked eighth in scoring with 213 
points in 14 games (15.2 PPG). Praesel 
finished his Carnegie Mellon career with 
998 points, scoring 18 in the Tartansí 
season finale ó a 65-59 loss at Emory 
University on February 27.
Praesel, who came to Carnegie Mellon 
in 1996 after spending one year at the 
United States Military Academy, ranks 
15th in all-time scoring at Car≠
negie Mellon. He trails Mike Theodore 
(1947-50), who scored 1,060 points for 
the Tartans.
Praesel scored a career-high 28 points 
as a junior against Thiel College on 
February 28, 1998. He led the Tartan 
scoring column 10 times that year while 
being named to the All-UAA second team. 
He also led the Tartans in scoring nine 
times as a sophomore.
McNutt, earned an honorable men≠
tion as he averaged 12.0 PPG and a 
team-high 6.5 RPG. In the UAA, McNutt 
shot 48 percent from the field, which 
ranked him second in the league.
McNutt tied a career-high with 19 
points in the Tartansí loss at Emory. He 
also scored 19 points in the Tartansí 95- 
69 win over Bethany College on Febru≠
ary 24 and in a 69-65 loss to Thiel on 
January 12. He grabbed a career-high
16 rebounds in Carnegie Mellonís 75-69 
wan over Emory on December 4, 1998. 
This season, McNutt led the Tartans 
in scoring six times and rebounding 
10 times.

The Carnegie Mellon tennis teams 
began the 1999 spring season with a 
pair of road matches on February 19 and 
20. The road trip took featured stops at 
Mercyhurst College and Case Western 
Reserve University.
On the menís side, the season opener 
at Mercyhurst was a one-sided 
affair. The Tartans went 5-1 in singles 
matches and 2-1 in doubles to take the 
match 7-2. Sophomores Sameer Kero, 
David Sullivan, and Kevin Chan and 
first-year Jin Phanichphant each won 
their single matches in straight sets. 
First-year Jason Nickell won his match 
by default. Sophomore Chanakya 
Oza suffered the only Tartan loss in 
three sets.
In doubles, Oza and Phanichphant 
lost a close match, 8-5, while the 
team of Kero and sophomore Apurva 
Kothari won 8-3. Sullivan and 
Nickell won their match by de≠
fault. Womenís results for the match 
were unavailable.
Against CWRU, the men won only 
two singles matches and dropped all 
three doubles matches to lose 7-2. 
Phanichphant and Sullivan were the 
lone winners for CMU, winning 6ó2,6-
2 and 1-6, 6-2, 6-1, respectively.
The women fared much better against 
CWRU, winning the match 7-2. Seniors 
Keri Mills and Whitney Brooks, sopho≠
more Jessica Chiu, and first-years Kelly 
Chanopas and Jill Palermo all won for 
the Tartans. Senior Julie Balch fell 7-5, 
7-6 in the only singles loss for CMU.
Mills and Palermo held on to win their 
doubles match 8-5, and Chanopas and 
Chiu teamed up to cruise to a 8-0 vic≠
tory. The teams also played Oberlin 
College on Saturday, March 6, and will
leave for a seven-game trip through 
South Carolina over spring break.

Last Thursdayís intramural basket≠
ball championship games featured 
reckless defense of last yearís titles, 
countless nail-biting moments, and 
even an overtime spectacle as the 
grand finale.
The womenís division started off the 
action at 4:45, and, 45 minutes later, 
the first title was decided. In fact, it 
was also the first title defense of the 
evening as Raininí Threes grabbed the 
game 31-26 over the Hoopers. The 
teamís new blood carried to victory as 
first-year student and center Katrina 
Snell sank 13 points and captured the 
Most Valuable Player (MVP) title.
Next up were the men. The minors 
division championship, pitting the 
Buttersville Bombers versus the Delt 
Scrubs, took the floor at 6 pm. 
Buttersvilleís senior Anthony Enos 
stole the spotlight for most of the game, 
draining 21 points and winning the 
MVP as the Bombers pulled out a 
37-30 win.
The intermediate game pitted SAE 
Job versus Beta Buck Naked. Three 
people scored in double digits ó in≠
cluding Betaís sophomore Bobby 
Tracey and SAEís senior Jon Rotter 
who each had 15. When the dust 
cleared, SAE Job slipped away with a 
43-40 win.
As the finale for the night, the ma≠
jors division got underway at 8:30. 
White Trash looked to defend their 
title against the Frutee Guys, but the 
Fratees were up to the challenge. 
Regulation time couldnít decide it, and 
the game was forced into over≠
time where Trash won again, 35-31, 
on the strength of seniors Mike Stango 
and Brian Gustafsonís 10 and 14 
points respectively.

CMU gets 
experience
BBALL, from page 12
Praesel finished the game with 18 
points ó 998 for his career ó putting 
him at 15th all-time on the Tartansí 
scoring list.
ìIt was disappointing,î said Wingen. 
ìFor a three-year career, however, itís 
still very impressive.î
The Tartans also ended the season on 
the short end of the stick. They lost the 
game 65-59, and finished the season 
with a 5-20 record.
ìOur record wasnít what weíd wanted 
it to be... but one thing that we set out to 
accomplish at the beginning of the sea≠
son was get the young people some expe≠
rience ó and we did that,î said Wingen. 
ìThat will pay off in the future. Now 
these guys have to prepare themselyes 
in the off-season, and, as a coaching 
staff, we have to follow up this yearís_big 
freshman class with another strongl^e- 
cruiting season.î
The ideal recruits that Wingen is look≠
ing for are ìversatile, mid-sized playersî 
to add depth at the point guard position.
He also cited some of the limitations 
of the recruiting program. ìIn Division 
III, without scholarships, you go out 
with goals and thumbnail sketches for a 
team but you are a little limited. You 
cannot choose a class with certainty. 
The key is to go after enough players in 
the recruiting pool to yield the number 
you want.î
According to Wingen, the team 
usually retains one out of five recruits 
who apply to the school and express 
interest in the team. This year, 25 re≠
cruits have applied, which should yield 
the desired 4-5 players from the incom≠
ing class of 2003.
The new players will join a team in a 
much better starting position than this 
yearís edition. The teamís youth was a 
definite hindrance to the overall perfor≠
mance this season. With a full year of 
experience now under their belts, the 
young players forced into action this 
season will be experienced veterans 
ready for anything that could come their 
way next year.

longer in retirement. It might be the 
greatest financial test you'll ever face. 
Fortunately, you have two valuable

Delaying your decision for even a year or 
two can have a big impact on the amount 
of income you'll have when you retire.
Whats the simplest way to get started? 
Save in pretax dollars and make the most 
of tax deferral. Thereís simply no more 
painless or powerful way to build a 
comfortable and secure tomorrow.

Long season ends 
with another loss
Women take fourth in UAA
Tartan file photo
The womensí basketball team split two league games last week, beating Rochester 
and losing to Emory, but dropped to fourth in the UAA standings.
Forget March Madness ó the most 
intense basketball action in the country 
was in Pittsburgh two weeks ago as the 
CMU womenís basketball team wrapped 
up their season with a pair of league 
games that finished off their desperate 
rush for third place in the UAA.
First up for the Tartans was their 
final home game of the season on Sun≠
day, February 21 against the University 
of Rochester. The team said farewell to 
the home crowd in style, turning in 
one of their highest offensive outputs of 
the season.
ìIt was a great game for Senior Day,î 
head coach Gerri Seidl said. ìEveryone 
really went all out to play a good 
game for our one senior [forward 
Amanda Tishkoff].î
Though not holding a major edge in 
any statistical category, CMU was in 
charge most of the game, thanks to 
Rochesterís inability to find its shooting 
touch. Rochester shot a paltry 11 of 33 
from the floor in the first half, including 
zero for 10 from behind the 3-point arc. 
The Tartans, meanwhile, hit 14 of their 
32 shots (44 percent), including all three 
3-point attempts, to build a 12-point 
halftime lead.
A key point for the Tartans was shut≠
ting down the Rochester guard who had 
scorched them in the previous meeting 
between the two teams, going six for six 
from 3-point range. ìOur game plan was 
to do things a little differently than in 
the last game,î Seidl said. ìAnd Kara 
[Coval] did a great job shutting down 
their top scorer.î
With UAA rankings on the line, both 
teams stepped up the intensity in the 
second half. Though managing fewer 
attempts than in the first half, the 
Tartans kept their point production up 
by shooting 48 percent from the floor. 
Fighting desperately to stay in the 
game, Rochester shot a blistering 52 
percent in an all-out effort to erase the 
Tartansí lead.
In the end, it was CMUís 15-for-21 
performance from the free-throw line 
that sealed the victory. Sophomore 
guard Lauren Petruzzi connected on 
seven of her 11 opportunities from the 
charity stripe, including several in the 
last couple of minutes to prevent Roch≠
ester from closing the gap. The' final 
score was 72-63.
To complement Petruzziís game- 
high 24 points, junior forward Amy 
Novak, junior center Coval, and junior 
guard Lacey Perretta each contributed 
10 of their own. Petruzzi and Coval were 
the team leaders for almost the entire 
game, literally. Coval played 38 out of 
the gameís 40 minutes, while Petruzzi 
played 39.
The win allowed the Tartans to keep 
pace with Emory University for
third place in the conference, adding 
even more drama to the season-ending 
match-up between the two teams on 
February 27.
The team traveled to Emory with a 
chance to end the season on a high note, 
but returned home reflecting on one of 
their most disappointing performances. 
Everything that helped earn the win 
over Rochester went completely out the 
window. Emory brought the Tartansí 
season to a crashing halt.
Neither team was completely on its 
game, but Emory was clearly the 
dominant team. Defensively, Emory ex≠
ploited the Tartansí tendency to lose 
control under intense pressure, and fin≠
ished the game with 13 steals. When the 
Emory defenders werenít taking the ball, 
they were tightly guarding the CMU 
shooters and not allowing open looks at 
the basket.
ìWe wanted to keep the tempo down 
because theyíre a quick team that likes 
to run,î Seidl said. ìWe started out play≠
ing well ó we just couldnít put the ball 
in the basket.î
Unable to consistently make baskets, 
the Tartans were never in the game. 
Emory jumped out early and never 
looked back, taking a 24-point lead into 
the halftime break. The second half 
was more of the same as Emory out- 
scored the Tartans 26-17 to extend the 
margin of victory to 33. The final score 
was 70-37.
ìEven down 24 at halftime, I felt we 
could come back, because weíve done it 
before,î Seidl said. ìBut we never got on 
our game.î
Junior center Samantha Majernik led 
the Tartans with eight points, as CMU 
shot just 26 percent from the floor. CMU 
finished with 22 turnovers, and was out- 
rebounded 51-37.
Despite ending the season on a low 
note, Seidl was more than satisfied with 
the teamís overall performance. ìItís dis≠
appointing to end on a loss, but Iím 
thrilled to finish fourth in the UAA, 
especially since we were picked to finish 
very low,î she said.
Overall, Seidl saw the season as a 
crucial step towards more successful 
campaigns in the future. ìIím very happy 
with the season; obviously you want to 
win more, but we really progressed as a 
team,î she said.
With all but one member of this yearís 
squad returning next year, the Tartans 
have a very solid core to build off of in 
years to come. According to Seidl, the 
team is close to being a truly competitive 
team. ìThe one element weíre missing is 
a player who wants the; ball game in and 
game out,î she said. ìLauren [Petruzzi] 
sort of stepped into that role over the 
last few games of this season; she really 
put the team on her shoulders.î
If someone can step into the scorerís 
role, look for next yearís team to improve 
on this yearís impressive 11ó14 record.
March Madness
by Pete Patterson
Anyone watching college bas≠
ketball this weekend would think 
that the NCAA tournament was 
a mere formality ó a battle for 
second place behind the unques≠
tioned kings of college hoops, the 
Duke Blue Devils. They have a 
compelling argument, as Duke 
has a roster loaded with eight 
McDonaldís High School All- 
Americans, has an average mar≠
gin of victory in the 20s, and hasnít 
lost since December in becoming 
the first Atlantic Coast Confer≠
ence team to go through the 
league without a loss since the 
expansion to nine teams.
But before anyone takes the 
stories that are already pushing 
this yearís Duke squad as the 
best in history too seriously, re≠
member that there is still a tour≠
nament to play. If there is one 
thing to be learned about the 
NCAA tournament, it is to expect 
the unexpected. Who will defeat
this juggernaut? The following is 
a region-by-region look at the 
brackets, where my answer to 
this question, as well as some 
other ideas to consider for your 
pool selections, can be found.
South
Auburn received the number- 
one seed in the region that con≠
tains the two best junior college 
transfe'rs in the country, the 
Tigersí Chris Porter and 
Marylandís Steve Francis. This 
figures to be an exciting bracket 
to watch, as itís filled with ex≠
tremely athletic and up-tempo 
teams such as Auburn, Maryland, 
St. Johnís, Ohio State, and UCLA. 
Early-round upsets to consider 
are George Washington over In≠
diana and Detroit over UCLA. A 
match-up between Francis and 
Porter in the regional finals would 
be intriguing, but after watching 
St. Johnís battle Duke in early 
February, it became apparent 
they have their own explosive 
junior college talent in Bootsy 
Thornton, who dropped 40 points 
on the Devils. The Redstorm also 
have Ron Artest, one of the best 
all-around players in the nation, 
as well as first-year sensation 
point guard Erick Barkley. I see 
St. Johnís defeating Auburn to go 
to St. Petersburg.
West
The Connecticut Huskies got a 
number-one seed, but due to a 
late-season slump, they were 
shipped out West, far away from 
the comforts of home. Stanford 
awaits them in the regional 
finals, and due to the Cardinalsí 
inside depth provided by Tim 
Young, Mark Madsen, Pete 
Sauer, and the Collins twins, 
Jarron and Jason, Connecticut 
and their suspect frontcourt will 
be defeated. A good upset pick 
is Gonzaga, best known for 
producing John Stockton, over 
reeling Minnesota.
Midwest
The Midwest region contains 
some of the nationís most 
outstanding individual play≠
ers in Michigan Stateís Mateen 
Cleaves, Utahís Andre Miller, 
Rhode Islandís Lamar Odom, 
Miami (OH)ís Wally Szczerbiak, 
and Arizonaís Jason Terry. I see 
Cleavesís Spartans holding 
off Millerís Utes in the regional 
final to give Michigan State a 
spot in the Final Four. Watch out 
for Evansville against an over≠
rated Kansas team, and look for 
Rhode Island, which is play≠
ing very well lately, to give 
UNC-Charlotte a challenge in the 
first round.
East
That brings us to the final re≠
gion, the East, led by the Duke 
Blue Devils. I see Duke cruising 
through the region by beating 
Cincinnati in the finals. This 
would be a great match-up be≠
tween the Devils and the only 
team to beat them this season, 
but the Bearcats have been 
plagued by inconsistent guard 
play since their victory in Decem≠
ber. The Blue Devils will get their 
revenge and go to the Final Four. 
This is one region where I donít 
see many early-round upsets oc≠
curring, but SW Missouri State 
could give Wisconsin a good game.
That leaves me with four teams: 
St. Johnís, Stanford, Michigan 
State, and Duke. St. Johnís will 
knock offStanford, and Michigan 
State will be the team to beat 
Duke. They have the perfect in≠
gredients, as they are a veteran 
team that defends well, has solid 
guard play with Cleaves and 
Charlie Bell, and wonít be over≠
whelmed by the Blue Devils 
plethora of physical forwards. 
Michigan State will then go on to 
beat the Johnnies in the title game 
for their first championship since 
the Magic Johnson-led í79 team.

It has been a tough season for the 
Carnegie Mellon menís basketball 
team. With nine first-year students on 
the roster, it was understandably a 
growing year. Not even head coach 
Tony Wingen expected the Tartans to 
struggle this much, however.
ìNo one really ran away with [the 
top spot in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA)] like Chicago 
did in the past. I did think that weíd be

in the middle of it.... I was disap≠
pointed we were at the bottom for 
much of the season.î
The Tartans finished the season with 
a few positive notes during the week of 
February 20-27, and are already look≠
ing toward the future.
After an 85-76 shoot-out loss to 
Rochester on February 16, the Tar≠
tans closed out their home schedule on 
February 24 with a victory over 
Bethany College.
The Tartansí defense didnít give the 
greatest performance against Roches-
and maturity, the Tartans held tough 
and pulled away.
The Bethany game gave quite a 
finish to the home season. ìThe 
last 11 minutes of that game were 
some of the bestóif not the best ó10 
or 11 minutes of basketball we played 
this season,î said Wingen. ìBethany 
got a little tired and we took advan≠
tage of it.î
In the end, the Tartans left Skibo 
Gym with both their highest scoring 
output and largest margin of 
victory of the year, demolishing 
Bethany 95-69. 
It was the 
teamís first win 
in their last 
seven games, 
and it set a good 
tone for the sea≠
son finale ver≠
sus UAA oppo≠
nent Emory on 
February 27 in 
Atlanta.
The Emory 
game repre≠
sented more 
than just the 
end of a season. 
For the Tartan 
seniors, includ≠
ing forward Dan 
Bowersox and 
guard Tommy 
Praesel, it was 
the end of a ca≠
reer. Praesel 
was a mere 20 
points away 
from 1,000 in 
his three-year 
career as a Tar≠
tan goingin, and 
the team was set 
to help him to 
get over the mil≠
lennium mark. 
Praesel got all 
the opportunities he needed, taking
17 shots from the floor and eight free 
throws in all. He crossed into double≠
digit scoring early in the game. Luck 
was not on his side down the 
stretch, however.
ìThere were two calls late in the 
game that went against the team and 
one versus Tommy, personally,î said 
Wingen. ìOne was a questionable no≠
call and the other was a charge called 
on Praesel. It may seem like squab≠
bling over little points, but since 
Praesel already had 18 points and was
ter, but the offense more than made up shooting seven of eight from the char- 
for it. The game was close most of the ity stripe, it seemed like the world.î

University offers alternative living options
ByASEEM S. GUPTA
Tartan Acting Features Editor
Itís that time of year when students 
can be overheard everywhere on cam≠
pus talking about where they are 
going to live next year. With the ini≠
tial lottery process of Room Draw
1999 complete, many students have 
begun to explore some of the alterna≠
tive housing options available. One 
such option is CMUís Special Interest 
Housing program.
Special interest housing provides 
groups of students sharing a common 
interest with an opportunity to apply 
for on-campus housing in dormitories 
or on-campus apartment buildings 
such as Margaret Morrison, as well as 
the free-standing houses on Roselawn 
Terrace. ìThe main advantage is that 
[special interest housing] offers a 
social and common meeting ground so 
that the organizations can 
have a place where they can open
their doors to members,î said Lorrie 
Safar, coordinator of Housing Assign≠
ment Operations.
In addition to providing a place for 
group meetings, organizations in spe≠
cial interest housing are expected to
conduct programs that __________
involve and contribute to 
the CMU community 
Each year the student 
affairs office along with

Council and Housing 
Services review numer≠
ous new and renewal ___________
applications in a selec-
tive process to fill the limited group
housing areas on campus.
ìMy concern in looking at things is 
usually a little different from Student 
Life,î said Safar. ìThe housing is 
usually in a desirable location, and I 
want to know if this is just a 
group of friends looking for a place to 
live. Iím really concerned with what
theyíve proposed and what theyíve 
done in the past.î
Two of the oldest special interest 
houses are Tech House, on Roselawn 
Terrace, and Spirit House, on Mar≠
garet Morrison Street. ìTheyíve
ì[Special interest housing] really 
offers to students an integration of 
all the aspects of their lives. î
óHolly Hippensteel, Student Life
really integrated themselves into 
the community,î said Holly Hippen≠
steel, coordinator of student life. The 
Asian Student Association in Mar≠
garet Morrison Apartments and 
International House in Resnik are 
some of the younger student organi≠
zations who currently live in special 
interest housing.
While Safar acknowledged the suc≠
cess of special interest housing, she 
said she feels that the program has 
reached a plateau. ìSome of the 
newer houses I tend to question,î said 
Safar. ìStudents are doing things, but
ï  thereís not enough con≠
sistency among groups. 
Iíd like to see the pro≠
gram taken to the next 
level.î
Hippensteel said she 
shares Safarís views on 
the future of the pro≠
gram. ìNext year we will 
have two coordinators,î 
said Hippensteel. She said that new 
checkpoints will be instituted next 
year that will benifit the 
system. ìHouses will have to pull 
together an action plan that will have 
to be a very clear outline of what their 
plan will be for that semester,î she 
said. ìTwo coordinators will make 
sure that the action plan is on course
through monthly meetings with the 
house managers.î
ìThe application [for the 1999-2000 
academic year] talks about visions 
and goals,î said Hippensteel. ìWhat 
are the goals and why do they need a 
separate place to achieve those goals? 
Weíre looking for people who can 
fill the spaces and really follow 
through.î House managers are asked 
to sign an agreement saying that the 
house will offer at least one commu≠
nity service event along with two edu≠
cational events. While applications 
for special interest housing have 
already been read, students have a 
wide variety of existing houses and 
programs to pursue. Houses do not 
require applications except for Spirit 
House and Tech House. ìIt [special 
´ interest housing] really offers to stu≠
dents an integration of all the aspects 
of their lives,î said Hippensteel of the 
various special interest housing 
options to students.

Your older brother used to 
flick peas at you from across 
the table and get away with it. 
Your roommate considers 
Britney Spears to be the 
greatest thing since the people 
at Top Ramen made it possible 
to dine without ever having to

After years of clashing per≠
sonalities, it might be time to 
move in with someone who 
has something in common. 
With special interest houses, 
students can now live 
with someone with whom 
they can grow and learn 
instead of contemplating first- 
degree murder.
The two most recognizable 
special interest houses on 
campus are Tech House and 
Spirit House. They are both 
overseen by Housing Services 
and foster an independent res≠

kitchen facilities for those liv≠

Tech House, which is located 
at the top of Roselawn Ter≠
race, is a place for CMU 
Roman Catholic students to 
live and work together. It was 
formed over 30 years ago in a 
place where many students 
pass by each day: the compass 
located next to Resnik Hall.
ìThe Home Economics Lab 
at 5125 Margaret Morrison 
Avenue was turned into Tech 
House after the Margaret 
Morrison College for women 
was closed,î said Jeffrey 
Harper, senior electrical and 
computer engineering major 
and house manager for Tech 
House. ìThat house was even≠
tually torn down, and we 
moved into our current house 
on Roselawn in 1987.î
Presently, there are five res≠
idents of Tech House. The 
activities of the Tech House 
are not just restricted to its 
occupants, however. All mem≠
bers of the CMU Catholic com≠
of work to do and I couldnít 
get it done.î
Residents are responsible for 
ensuring that the noise gener≠
ated within their apartments 
is not audible at a distance of 
10 feet from their room. Stu≠
dents assigned to Welch are 
required to sign a Quiet Living 
Agreement, which extends the 
Universityís current Quiet 
Hours policy to 24 hours per 
day. Therefore this accomada- 
tion is not for everyone.
ìThe only major downside is 
that I do not really know my 
neighbors in the hall like I 
used to. I wouldnít recommend 
it to people that like to be 
friends with everyone on their 
floor and like to always leave 
their door open. That doesnít 
happen in a quiet living 
arrangement,î said Pollice.
ìItís nice to be able to come 
home at 2 in the morning and 
not have to worry about 
drunken revelers running up 
and down the hallway while 
youíre trying to sleep,î said 
April Gillespie, a sophomore 
music major. ìI feel that living 
in Welch has been extremely 
positive. Itís a very comfort≠
able place to live, and the 
few people Iíve met have been 
very nice.î
Beginning in fall of 1997, 
Housing designated Hender≠
son House as the campus sub≠
stance-free ìWellness Hall.î 
The objective of this program 
is to get residents to focus on 
holistic health.
Physical and emotional 
health problems can compro≠
mise student academic perfor≠
mance and well being and 
contribute negatively to stu≠
dent retention.
The wellness housing pro≠
gram is student driven and it 
regularly solicits student 
input in all of its programmat≠
ic initiatives. It is a coopera≠
tive effort among the residents 
of Henderson House 
and staff in the Office of Ath≠
letics, Student Health Ser≠
vices, Student Life, and Hous-

munity, and even Catholics 
from other Pittsburgh col≠
leges, are invited to hang out 
at the house, as well as partic≠
ipate in the events there, such 
as Bible stud≠
ies, dinners, 
and service pro≠
jects.
ìWe do a lot of 
community ser≠
vice in conjunc≠
tion with the 
Newman Club 
at Pitt and 
CMU. We also 
do things with 
the fathers of 
the Pittsburgh 
Oratory,î said 
Harper. ìIn the 
past, weíve 
worked in Inde- 
pendence 
Court, the Chil≠
drenís Hospital, 
and Food
Share.î
Located on 
Margaret Mor≠
rison Avenue,
Spirit House is 
not too far away 
from Tech 
House.
ìSpirit House 
is a communal- 
style living 
environment 
for eight people 
providing a 
nurturing and 
support atmos≠
phere for stu≠
dents, particu≠
larly black stu≠
dents,î said 
Alexandra 
Atkins, a senior 
mechanical 
engineering 
major . and 
house manager 
of Spirit House.
This house is slightly bigger 
than Tech House, serving as 
the residence for as many as 
15 people in its seven bed≠
rooms since its creation in 
1972. The building used to be 
a fraternity house before its
transformation.
ì[Spirit House]1 was an idea 
between the Dean of Students, 
Charles Williams, and Cam≠
pus Housing,î said Atkins. ìIt
was to provide a support net≠
work and gathering place for 
black students on campus.î 
Like Tech House, Spirit 
House participates in several 
community service projects.

Tartan Contributing Editor
Itís around this time of year that the 
rainy season comes to Pittsburgh. Itís 
also around this time of year that some 
CMU students think about and begin 
planning to study abroad.
The goal of the Office of International 
Education, which oversees the Study 
Abroad program, is to promote an 
international environment at CMU. 
Every day, undergraduates make 
appointments to consult with Study 
Abroad Advisor Eva Mergner in her 
office, which contains many resources. 
The Tartan recently spoke to Mergner 
about the motivations, experiences, and 
processes that come along with study≠
ing abroad.
The Tartan: What is your primary 
role as the study abroad advisor?
Eva Mergner: My role is to both pro≠
mote study abroad at CMU and to 
advise and support students who 
are preparing and returning from 
other countries.
This includes publicizing, advising, 
support programming, and even re≠
entry programming, which we call 
ìWelcome Backî orientation because 
sometimes coming back is harder 
than leaving.
IT: There are many students who 
are in these programs, but arenít sure 
if they can afford it. What do you say so 
that they donít get discouraged?
EM: I tell them that most people can 
find a way to fund study abroad. 
At Carnegie Mellon, there are a couple 
of different ways where you can 
go abroad and take all of your 
funding with you. So funding 
shouldnít be a reason not to go.... There 
are programs, for example, like the 
[State University of New Yorkís] series 
of programs, that are very inexpensive
Erica Yamada/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
Mergnerís Warner Hall office features many resources on Study Abroad programs.
and very good.
And if a student directly enrolls in a 
public German university, for instance, 
[he] pays about $400 a year for tuition 
because itís state-supported. The Ger≠
mans are, of course, paying it with 
their taxes.
EM: We send about 200 students a 
year overseas, but that includes sum≠
mer, which probably makes up about 
half the number. We have students 
from most departments go. In general, 
engineering and science majors are 
considered a minority because their
TT: What are the different types of curriculums usually have less flexibili-
programs set up for students when 
they go overseas?
EM: The type of study abroad pro≠
grams that you can go on fall 
along a wide spectrum. There are 
some where youíre actually at the 
university, studying with local stu≠
dents, to the complete opposite ... 
where itís all-American with American 
teachers on an American schedule in 
another country.
This is called an island program. 
Then thereís everything in between. A 
lotof foreign universities will have a 
department in their own school 
which consists of courses for non≠
native speakers.
TT: What types of students typically 
want to study abroad?
ty with using a program in another 
institution. But we actually donít have 
that problem; our engineering students 
go abroad more than [those students 
at] many other institutions.
Art and architecture majors are per≠
haps the majority of our study abroad 
students, but engineering runs a good 
third. Humanities and Social Sciences 
students are there as well, but not as 
much as you might expect.
TT: Which destinations are popular?
EM: For the majority of CMU stu≠
dents, itís Europe, especially the Unit≠
ed Kingdom. Italy is also very popular 
due to the interest it has for architec≠
ture majors. Switzerland, too, because 
we have an exchange program there 
that provides easy access for engineers.
There are a handful of students who 
venture elsewhere than Europe. In the 
last few years, a couple of students 
have gone to Africa. We have a student 
right now who is in India for the full 
year. Then there are also exchanges 
with South and Central America. We 
have an exchange program with Mexi≠
co, so students go there. But itís still 
only one or two going there, and 
not a massive amount in that direc≠
tion. Not too many go to Asia either, 
except for Japan.
TT: What should students do if they 
are interested in study abroad?
EM: The first thing they should do is 
make an appointment with me. Then I 
can talk about all the aspects of the 
process and what you want to think 
about, because there are a lot of differ≠
ent things that people need to think 
about in determining what they want 
to do. Where do you want to live? What 
is your motivation for going? Is it to 
travel around Europe or Asia or anoth≠
er part of the world and get to know a 
lot of people? Or do you want to 
immerse yourself in one culture?
I get lots of people coming in not sure 
about what they want to do. We can 
talk about what possibilities are 
out there, and then we can look into 
those possibilities.
TT: What would you tell students 
who are interested in studying abroad, 
but hesitate because it would a whole 
new environment?
EM: Well, first of all, itís not for 
everyone. But for those who decide to 
study abroad, I think itís a life- 
changing decision: You will be different 
on the other side for reasons you 
wouldnít expect.
And even if you have a bad experi≠
ence abroad, when you come back, the 
way you live your life ó the way you 
previously took things for granted ó 
will be different.

Exhibit examines issue of cross-cultural adoptions
By JENN PELLECCHIA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
ìIt doesnít say ëDo Not 
Touch.í That means I can 
touch it,î was just one of the 
many little-boyisms that could 
be overheard in the University 
Center Art Gallery last 
Thursday night. As students 
and other members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
contemplated the paintings 
and photographs at the open≠
ing of Emily Merzís exhibition 
entitled Redefine: A Look 
Into Cross-Cultural Adoption, 
a group of young adopted 
children capered underfoot, 
bringing Merzís images very 
much to life with their visit to 
the exhibit.
The purpose of Merzís exhi≠
bition is to increase local 
awareness of international
adoption programs.
Merzís family, which 
includes five adopted brothers 
from Paraguay, Russia, and 
Puerto Rico, served as the 
inspiration for her work. 
Merz, a junior art major who 
focuses on painting and elec≠
tronic media, also interviewed 
and photographed other area 
families that included chil≠
dren adopted from nations 
outside the United States.
ìThe circumstance of each 
childís adoption is different. 
Families are motivated to 
adopt for different reasons. 
Adoptive families are 
strengthened and enhanced 
through adoption programs, 
and orphaned children are 
given a family with whom 
they will have a lifelong inti≠
mate connection,î Merz wrote 
of her experience.
Mixing aesthetics and social 
consciousness, Merzís canvas≠
es incorporate bright colors 
and a variety of textures. 
Some of her work includes 
denim camouflage she fash≠
ioned from old blue jeans, 
which she said she feels is 
symbolic of the way the inter≠
national adopted children 
have all managed to blend into 
their new culture.
One painting features all 
five of her brothers, their faces 
affixed to the bodies of 
superheroes, signifying the 
manner in which they are 
now being raised as young 
American men.
ìTheyíve taken the identity 
of American boys,î said Merz. 
In contrast, her black-and- 
white photographs are 
extremely simple, capturing 
moments in the daily life of
the multi-cultural families.
Thought-provoking as well 
as visually appealing, Merzís 
work is accompanied by writ≠
ten praise of cross-cultural 
adoption, in which she also 
states her concern about 
the increasing difficulty of the 
process. Problems are particu≠
larly prevalent in Russia.
ìOver 50,000 children are 
currently waiting in Russian 
child houses to be adopted. 
Many of these children, 
especially the older children, 
the ones with brothers and 
sisters, and those with 
isabilities, will never be adopt≠
ed.... Cross-cultural adoption, 
especially involving Russia, 
is always at risk of being 
ended. This would be a 
tremendous loss for both the 
waiting families in the United 
States and waiting children in
Russian orphanages.î
Merzís family, as well as 
most of her subjects, were 
in attendance at the opening, 
adding yet another dimension 
to the overall effect of 
the presentation.
Pointing at their own faces 
on the walls, scribbling child≠
ish ëthank-yousí in the guest≠
book, fingering the canvases 
when they thought no one was 
looking, the presence of many 
adopted children helped to 
create an unpretentious 
atmosphere.
Merzís work will be on dis≠
play from March 2 until 
March 13. The UC Gallery is 
open Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Friday from 11 am to 5 pm, 
Wednesday from 11 am to 7 
pm and Saturday from noon 
to 3 pm.

Writer ponders opportunities for summer jobs
Less Stress?
by Emily Landes
All right, I admit it. Iím beginning to 
get a little bit frustrated. Why, you 
ask? Iím uncertain of my future. Iím 
broke. Iím stressed out. My tongue 
canít lose the flavor of that particular≠
ly vile-tasting glue used only on 
stamps and envelopes. And, most dis≠
turbing of all, my lips are permanently 
pursed from all the ass kissing Iíve 
done, and thereís more to come in the 
near future.
If you donít know the cause of my 
pains yet, then you must be a comput≠
er science major. Any self-respecting 
humanities student knows by now that 
I dream the impossible dream. In a 
word: Internship.
We all know what it is, but in our 
parentsí time the word ìinternshipî
didnít even exist. (And wasnít the dic≠
tionary all the more appealing for it?) 
They got summer jobs at retail stores, 
swimming pools, movie theaters, 
and restaurants.
They werenít worried about the 
future. And why should they have 
been? They were only 19, 20, or 21 
years old.
But unfortunately that time is gone, 
and it seems that the internship will 
be with us for a while. Iíd like to get 
my hands on the first idiot who decid≠
ed that his or her travel down the road 
to adulthood wasnít going fast enough. 
Whoever it was, he or she started a 
wave of concern among college stu≠
dents like us. The big fret was this: 
What if Iím left behind?
Our world is a considerably more 
competitive one than that of our par≠
ents, which is why the internship is 
not just a way to gain experiences 
and discover new skills. Itís a way to 
prove that you have more experience, 
more skills, more whatever than 
the next guy.
Of course, thatís not what you say in 
the big interview. In that room, with 
your legs crossed, your charcoal
gray/black/navy interview suit nicely son who knew somebody that might be 
pressed, and your hands clasped on able to hook me up. By ìhook me up,î I

Even suggesting that you hope to get than it takes to pick it up and 
something out of the program is put it under a big stack of other deserv- 
becoming taboo. ing rÈsumÈs.
ìOur world is a considerably more competi≠
tive one than that of our parents, which is 
why the internship is not just a way to gain 
experiences and discover new skills.î
When 400 people are applying for 
one position, the question isnít what 
can this company do for you, but what 
can you do for this company? Why 
should they let you file their papers 
and get their coffee for free? Who are 
you to demand such spoils?
Most of this applies to unfortunates 
like myself, who are silly enough to 
think we might get a job armed only 
with our humanities classes and CSW. 
And Iím better off than most.
My parents and I had huge brain≠
storming sessions to try and find a per-
So far, weíve found two prospects 
that may be promising. One pays $700 
... for the whole summer. The other 
pays nothing. Nada. Zilch.
It would seem that zilch is the com≠
mon payment for a humanities-based 
summer intern. I checked out a bunch 
of other interesting internships at 
www.jobtrak.com, and they all told 
similar stories.
Next to ìsalaryî some places wrote, 
ìSchool credit may be available.î Oth≠
ers flat-out said ìnone.î And even oth≠
ersó now this is the- worst ó just
left the salary space blank. Do you 
know what that glaring empty space 
said to me?
ìSilly writer, money is for techies.î '
All of this came to a head, for me 
anyway, at this yearís H&SS Job Fair.' 
As I looked around at my options 
(Peace Corps anyone?)I wanted to cry. 1 
dropped my resume off with two com≠
pany representatives, both of whom 
looked at my year and my major, said 
thank you very much, and politely, 
brushed me off.
ìWill someone get in touch with me?î, 
I asked hopefully. They tried not to] 
look me directly in the eye.
With nowhere left to go, but unwill≠
ing to give up quite yet, I went over,to; 
the information desk in the center of 
the room. Someone who works for the! 
Career Center came up to me and 
asked if I needed help finding anything 
in particular.
ìYeah,î I said, ìAjob.î She laughed. I; 
was serious.
Emily Landes loves her parents very 
much and hopes that they wonít mind if 
she has to live at home just a little bit 
longer than planned.

working with Brother-to-Broth- 
er and clean-ups in Schenley 
Park.
The residence is not indepen≠
dent of the organization SPIR≠
IT. Occupants must be mem≠
bers. They are required to 
attend at least half of the SPIR≠
IT general body meetings, 
serve on a committee, and par≠
ticipate in two or three major 
events. Several of the residents 
are officers and committee 
chairs of the organization.
To maintain residency at a 
special interest house, Housing 
Services requires the occupants 
to hold one social event and one 
community service event per 
semester. The social event often 
consists of a dinner.
Last semester, Tech House 
hosted a buffet-style, home- 
cooked dinner around Thanks≠
giving and opened the house to 
over two dozen guests. Spirit 
House also held a dinner for the 
workers who gave their a house 
a major renovation recently.
With Room Draw coming up, 
some students voiced mild 
objections to special interest 
housing, arguing that everyone 
should have an equal chance at 
receiving the assigned space.
ìI object to any student orga≠
nization that holds the same 
house for a number of years in 
a row,î said Thomas Capasso, a 
sophomore electrical and com≠
puter engineering major. ìThis 
is an unfair situation because a 
minority of students are getting 
a priority over the majority.î
Members of the Spirit House 
and Tech House, who must 
undergo a re-application 
process with Housing each 
year, said they disagree with 
this criticism.

Figure it out laÔ££.
'RoboGod' found Wonder Boy (WndrBy) floating, 
in an empty toiletbowl in Robert Downey Jr.ís 
Pittsburgh hotel room. The irony of the whole 
ordeal is that WndrBy was found floating in an 
empty toilet bowl. People float in water, not 
ceramic. But, you are wrong, and I am right. 
WndrBy was floating in a cocaine induced state 
and was located in an empty toiletbowl, there 
fore he was "floating, in an empty toiletbowl".
Wonder Boy is the bastard son of Wonder Woman 
and Aqua Man. Wonder Woman has many other 
illegitimate children, one of which is Johhny 
Quest. Wonder Boy survives off a strict diet of 
fake snow and burnt out 2,000 watt bulbs.
When Wonder Boy is on his "even stricter" diet, 
he has a shake for breakfast, a shake for lunch, 
and a sensible dinner. A sensible dinner involves 
human sacrifice to the 'RoboGod' in most cases.
´mai
'RoboGod* raised Wndrby as one of his own, 
but since had never had one of his own he 
raised Wndrby all wrong, horizontally inverted, 
and skewed about 13 degrees to the left. He 
would reward Wndrby with a human sacrifice, 
and punish him with He-Man action figures. 
During hurricanes, 'RoboGod' would chain 
Wndrby to the largest tree and cry "sail onward 
captain!" from the safety of the kitchen window.
Since Wndrby is the product of 2 of the more 
respected super heroes, his DNA strands 
are made up of superhuman fibers which 
endow him with the power of transparency 
when under water. Wndrby has been recognized 
for his underwater crime fighting against giant 
underwater eyeballs that devour all they see, 
but they can't see Wndrby so he can save the day.

And the Oscar goes to...
A preview of the 71st Academy Awards
But who will win?
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Watching the 71st Academy 
Awards should suffice as an in≠
teresting evening, as WWII dra≠
mas (Saving Private Ryan, The 
Thin Red Line) battle against 
Elizabethan costume pieces 
(Elizabeth, Shakespeare in Love), 
with the surprise Italian film Life 
is Beautiful looking to stir things 
up. So, without further ado, my 
picks for the winners in the six 
marquee categories:
Best Actor: The field this year 
features a wide range of perfor≠
mances, from Tom Hanksís por≠
trayal of the army captain in Sav≠
ing Private Ryan to Edward 
Nortonís skinhead in American 
History X. However, the race 
should be between the other three 
entrants, as Hanksís role was 
perhaps a bit too quieted and 
Nortonís film was involved in 
some controversy. This leaves 
Affliction's, Nick Nolte, Ian 
McKellen of Gods and 
Monsters, and writer-director-ac- 
tor triple threat Roberto Benigni 
of Life is Beautiful. Benigniís 
charming WWII prison camp 
comedy-drama will probably 
score elsewhere. Look for Nolte 
to take home the statuette 
over McKellen.
Best Actress: I would be lying 
if I said I had heard of all of this 
yearís Best Actress nominees. 
Elizabeth's Cate Blanchett and 
Brazilian Fernanda Montenegro 
of Central Station each earned 
their first nods ó nine more be≠
tween them and they will tie 
Meryl Streep, whose 11th came 
for her motherly role in One True 
Thing. Rounding out the field are 
Emily Watson of Hilary and 
Jackie and the clear front-run- 
ner, Shakespeare in Loveís 
Gwyneth Paltrow. Donít bank on 
Blanchett or Montenegro ó the 
former was vastly overshadowed 
by Paltrow, while the latter may 
be hurt by the fact that no one has 
ever heard of Central Station. I 
donít anticipate Streep scoring a 
third win, leaving Watson and 
Paltrow, and who can say no to 
Gwyneth Paltrow? Not the Acad≠
emy, I say.
Best Supporting Actor: An≠
other diverse field of actors, fea≠
turing Ed Harris (director in 
The Truman Show), Robert 
Duvall (lawyer in A Civil Ac≠
tion), Geoffrey Rush (theater 
owner in Shakespeare in Love), 
Billy Bob Thornton (slow-wit- 
ted thief in A Simple Plan), and 
James Coburn (patriarch in Af≠
fliction). First-timer Coburn 
seems unlikely, as does Harris
for his perhaps-too-subtle ef≠
fort in Truman. Duvall was 
turned down for what most 
critics consider an even better 
role last year for The Apostle, 
making it a tough choice be≠
tween Rush and Thornton. 
Give the edge to Rush, on 
Shakespeareís strength.
Best Supporting Actress: 
As usual, this category doesnít 
feature the sort of attention- 
grabbing performances char≠
acteristic of other Oscar cat≠
egories. It does, however, fea≠
ture veterans Judi Dench 
{Shakespeare in Love), Kathy 
Bates CPrimary Colors), and 
Lynn Redgrave (Gods and 
Monsters). Relative newcom≠
ers Rachel Griffiths and 
Brenda Blethyn were also cho≠
sen, for their roles in Hilary 
and Jackie and Little Voice, 
respectively. Denchís brief 
(nine minutes) ó although 
powerful ó turn as Queen 
Elizabeth, and Batesís un≠
eventful politicker in Primary 
Colors make them longshots, 
while an award for Blethyn 
seems even less probable. Look 
for Redgraveís first nomina≠
tion in 32 years to spin gold 
this year over Griffiths.
Best Director: Peter Weir 
will not win this award, inas≠
much as The Truman Show 
was not nominated for Best Pic≠
ture. That said, Steven 
Spielberg, John Madden, 
Roberto Benigni, and Terrence 
Malick will battle it out, having 
helmed their respected Best Pic≠
ture-nominated films.
Malick, along with his movie 
The Thin Red Line, looks like a 
very dark horse, while I think 
Madden will be rewarded some≠
time in the future, given 
Shakespeare in Loveís prom≠
ise. The Academy has a hard 
time passing up Spielberg for 
anything, but Iím going to 
choose the upset here and back 
Benigni. His multiple efforts 
to make Life is Beautiful, soon 
to be the Titanic of foreign 
films, should be rewarded, 
and this seems the most 
likely category.
Best Picture: Well, hereís 
the big one. To begin with, 
letís rule out Elizabeth and 
The Thin Red Line, an Old 
English drama and a World 
War II movie both overshad≠
owed by their respective cous≠
ins in the race. Life is Beauti≠
ful, I think, will simply prove 
too foreign to Academy voters, 
leaving the two remaining 
films as the clear front-run≠
ners. Shakespeare in Love 
earned 13 Os≠
car nomina≠
tions, one short 
of the record.
Saving Pri≠
vate Ryan has 
been hailed as 
the greatest war 
movie ever. 
Shakespeare 
has Gwyneth 
Paltrow. Pri≠
vate Ryan has 
Tom Hanks. 
Too close to call? 
Look for Saving 
Private Ryan to 
pull it out, al≠
though this 
writer would be 
more than 
pleased to see 
Shakespeare 
come through.

History of awards creates mystique
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Itís that time of year again when 
people all over the nation gather 
around their television sets to 
see their favorite actors and ac≠
tresses sport the latest fashions 
by top designers, pose for trigger- 
happy photographers, get made 
fun of by Joan Rivers, and ó oh 
ó get awarded the coveted Acad≠
emy Award. Now that the movie- 
going public has had ample time 
to recover from Titanic and its 
resultant media frenzy, itís once 
again time to watch the Acad≠
emy dish out awards to this yearís 
elite group of films, performers, 
musicians, and technicians 
deemed worthy of 
a nomination.
Hosted by 
Academy Award 
winner Whoopi 
Goldberg, this 
yearís Oscars on 
March 21 will 
mark the 71st 
year of awarding 
golden statues 
for outstanding 
cinematic achieve 
ment. The Academy 
Awards have been per≠
ceived by some as a mere fash≠
ion show/photo frenzy, even 
though at their inception, they 
were intended to honor film≠
makers and performers for up≠
holding the high standards of 
excellence in art established by 
the Academy.
But what is this enigmatic 
presence that is the Academy? 
Despite what many may think, 
the Academy is not merely an 
association of Siskels and Eberts 
playing God with the successes of 
motion pictures and the futures 
of its actors and actresses.
Established in 1927 as a non≠
profit organization and run by
the top film executives of the time, 
the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences was intended 
to promote progress in the cin≠
ematic arts and sciences, as well 
as to further interaction between 
professionals in the field and the 
public at large.
The Academy consists of 13 
branches including actors, art 
directors, cinematographers, di≠
rectors, and executives, among 
others, and is an extremely elite 
group. In order to be a candidate 
for admission into the Academy, 
one must be sponsored by two
an obviously elitist group, Ameri≠
cans have always idolized the 
silver screen. While the Oscars 
are the highlight of the year for 
many in the film industry, the 
awards were not always the 
glamorous, suspenseful event 
they are today.
The first Academy Awards were 
given out in 1929, shortly after 
sound had been introduced into 
filmmaking. In the ceremonyís

people in the branch to which one 
seeks admittance, and must go 
through a rather lengthy evalua≠
tion process. In essence, becom≠
ing a member of the Academy is 
almost as difficult as becoming a 
recipient of one of its awards.
Despite the presence of such
newspapers were given 
the names of the winners the 
night before the awards were dis≠
tributed, and as a result, many of 
the guests knew before going into 
the hall who had won the award. 
This lack of suspense was then 
remedied in 1940 when they 
adopted the sealed envelope for≠
mat which has become an ele≠
ment of the ceremony almost as
famous as the statues themselves. 
While most of the interest in the 
awards is generated by the stan≠
dard ìBest Filmî and ìBest Ac≠
torî awards, awards for the tech≠
nical aspects, shorter films, and 
documentaries were established 
early on in the Academyís hisr 
tory. Someone on the street might 
not be able to tell you who re: 
ceived the Oscar for ìBest Light≠
ing,î but the Academy never≠
theless recognizes excellence 
in that aspect of filmmaking 
just as it does the actors and 
actresses.
Despite the noble inten≠
tions of the Academy 
Awards, those in the 
film industry would 
be unrealistic to say 
that the awards 
have not been exr

their original 
intentions 
into a vir≠

frenzy. 
There are 
pre-Oscar 
telecasts, 
ìMake Your 
Predictionsî 
contests, maga≠
zine covers devoted 
to-the best and worst- 
dressed attendees, and, of 
course, the post-Oscar interviews 
and specials. It is perhaps due to 
all of this publicity that many 
viewers have adopted a good 
amount of indifference, and in 
some cases, disgust, for the Acad≠
emy Awards.
But with the absence of such 
films as Titanic dominating the 
awards in almost every category, 
this yearís ceremony might suc≠

those apathetic viewers. And if 
not, then thereís always 
the Grammys.
Academy members leave noteworthy 
movies, performances out of running
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Diversions Editor
In 1941, Orson Wellesís Citizen Kane lost 
eight out of its nine Oscar nominations in≠
cluding the award for best picture to How 
Green Was My Valley, a film that investi≠
gated the relationships of a Welsh mining 
family. Today, Kane has been named the 
greatest movie of all time, not only by the 
American Film Institute but by critics across 
the board. And How Green Was My Valley 
has faded away.
Many of the reasons for Kaneís failures on 
Oscar night were due to the fact that Welles 
had based his character on a publisher named 
William Randolph Hearst. Hearst became 
upset by the filmís portrayal of him and pro≠
hibited his newspapers from advertising for 
the picture. Hearst also persuaded theaters 
not to show the film by threatening to refuse 
their future ads in his papers. As a result, 
Kane suffered at the box office, and 
Welles took home a lonely statue for best 
original screenplay.
As we approach the Academy Awards 58 
years later, politics still influence Oscar nomi≠
nations, but with the growth of the media 
industry and of Hollywood, the reasons as to 
why films and actors are left out of the run≠
ning are less clear than they were in Citizen 
Kaneís case.
For instance, in cases when audiences and 
critics agree on a filmís success, such as this 
yearís The Truman Show, and the Academy 
failed to nominate the movie for best picture
or Jim Carrey for best actor, one wonders who 
the Academy is representing and what the 
ìbestî really means.
One note to make is that the public, whose 
approval for a film is shown by box office 
statistics, and the critics, who write the ar≠
ticles, are almost completely separate from 
the 5,000 Academy members who are respon≠
sible for what is nominated. Of course, the 
Academy is usually too proud to nominate a 
box office bomb, but on average, the members 
do not feel as much pressure from critics and 
audiences to nominate particular films or ac≠
tors as one might imagine.
For example, Pleasantville was lauded by 
critics and placed on numerous top ten lists 
but did not appear in any of Oscarís high≠
lighted categories: best picture, best director, 
best actor, best actress, best supporting actor, 
best supporting actress. The premise of the 
film may sound corny, but the message that 
Pleasantville sends is sincere. Brother and 
sister David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer 
(Reese Witherspoon) are brought away from 
their teenage lives in the í90s and into to 
characters on a ìFather Knows Bestî í50s-type 
sitcom after being sucked into Davidís favorite 
tÈlÈvision show, Pleasantville.
The filmís comment ó the í50s were less 
idealistic passionate than society and old 
sitcoms have led us to believe ó is drawn out 
well not only through the script, which was 
nominated for an award, but also through the 
supporting performance by Joan Allen, who 
plays David and Jenniferís mother. Allen plays 
a convincing Mrs. Cleaver character, but more
importantly, she conveyed her human emo≠
tions effectively as her black-and-white 
world of Pleasantville was slowly and sym≠
bolically colored with the additions of pas≠
sion, art, and books. Even though the cho≠
sen nominees for best supporting actress 
are worthy of their nods, Allen shall bË 
missed, as will be the film in the best 
picture category.
The whimsical Irish comedy which was 
not nominated for any awards was Waking 
Ned Devine. The film tells its story on the 
Irish island of Tullymore, where the town 
is faced with a news brief revealing that 
someone in their 53-person population 
holds a winning lottery ticket worth 7 
million pounds. Jackie OíShea (Ian 
Bannen) and Michael OíSullivan (David 
Kelly) find out the news and decide tp 
search for the winner.
They hold a party at the local bar, hoping 
that the winner will show up, but courft 
only 52 people there. Finally, Jackie and 
Michael realize that Ned Devine is missing 
and visit his house to investigate, only to 
find him passed away on his chair. How≠
ever, the winning ticket is still in his hand. 
Eventually, Jackie and Michael attempt to 
deceive the lottery official by impersonat≠
ing Ned in order to win the prize for them≠
selves and their town, which shares some of 
the winnings after agreeing to 
the plan.
The screenplay for Waking Ned Devine 
never slowed down and seemed to top itself

LIOybt ymgumM , amgMtlnt 't))rM sMnStginuN , v 'mg6b CoooFilmís players lack charisma
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Picture Courtney Love, Ben 
Affleck, Janeane Garofalo, and 
David Chappelle stirring a vat 
full of bad loviní. 200 Cigarettes, 
the new film directed by Risa 
Beamon Garcia, brings to mind 
the old clichÈ ìToo many cooks 
spoil the pot.î The star-studded 
cast stands around their bubbling 
Cauldron with no toil or trouble to 
throw in ó just angst and a few 
mildly amusing jokes.
The movie revolves around the 
events of New Yearís Eve in 1981. 
Characters range from a border- 
line-pornographic artist (Brian 
McCardie), to an actor afraid 
of'attachment (Jay Mohr). They 
are united by the cab driver 
(Chappelle), who drives them 
‡tÏd his girlfriend, Monica 
(ëMartha Plimpton), an overanx- 
ibiis party hostess.
Chappelleís character, known 
‡s'Disco Cabbie, attempts to teach 
Ms customers to keep women and 
riot to fight over men. The cabbie 
is the spirit of a good party, com≠
plete with disco dancing. Monica, 
on the other hand, sits in her 
apartment and worries that no 
one will show up to her party. All 
of her fretting prevents her from 
Èftjoying herself.
ë If all of the characters were as 
interesting as Disco Cabbie and 
Monica, 200 Cigarettes would be 
an enticing film. However, the 
script dishes up too many charac≠
ters with set roles and limited 
personalities. Of course thereís 
the bitter ex (Garofalo), the 
bad lover (McCardie), the 
slut (Love), and some who havenít 
reached their maturity Christina 
Rfdci and Gaby Hoffmann. No
time is spent building on these 
stock definitions. 200 Cigarettes 
only provides meager laughs 
during familiar situations. The 
movie succeeds when the char≠
acters question themselves ó 
Chappelle doubts his own ad≠
vice, and Monica deals with her 
one partygoer. Unfortunately, 
these are exceptions.
Far more satisfying in the 
film is the feel of the era. Vi≠
brant colors, interesting acces≠
sories, and a lively soundtrack 
bring the early í80s to life. In 
the opening scene and again 
later, the camera focuses, on 
the disco ball hanging from the 
Cabbieís rear-view mirror. 
People wear soft pink jackets, 
explosive yellow high heels, and 
green dresses. The walls of an 
Indian restaurant are a deep 
red, and the curtains of 
Monicaís apartment glow in 
blue and white. Women sport 
finger watches and hats with 
veils. The soundtrack to all of 
this splash contains, among 
others, upbeat numbers from 
Blondie and Bow Wow Wow.
Not everything in 200 Ciga≠
rettes fails; Garofalo as her 
usual acerbic self works well in 
a small role, and the two cen≠
tral characters succeed despite 
their stereotyped natures. But 
the film cannot be considered 
successful. Ricci and Hoffinanís 
accents grate after 30 seconds; 
thereís no tension between Love 
and her love interest, Paul 
Rudd; and a mysterious pack≠
age which is introduced in the 
movie is never explained. The 
film could have been a fresh 
take on the mystery of love. 
However, its underdeveloped 
characters hurt its potential.
Piano man remains in tune

They say that good things come 
to those who wait. That was cer≠
tainly the case with last 
Thursdayís Billy Joel concert at 
the Civic Arena, which had been 
postponed twice ó once in Sep≠
tember because Joel lost his voice 
and again in November because 
he had the flu. But after having 
purchased tickets over a year ago, 
fans finally got to see the Piano 
Man play an outstanding and 
well-rounded set that was well 
worth the wait.
Since Joel has not produced an 
album of new material since 1993, 
many fans were a bit unsure as to 
what he would play. These con≠
cerns were put to rest early in the 
show when Joel explained that 
he would mostly play ìa lot of old 
shit.î His set included a wide 
range of songs that spanned his 
entire career, including every≠
thing from the classic ìPiano 
Manî to the more recent hit, ìThe 
River of Dreams.î
If there is one word to describe 
Joelís music, itís ìeclectic.î His 
wide range of material was dem≠
onstrated as he frequently shifted 
from strong and powerful rock 
songs to soft and sentimental bal≠
lads. Throughout the show, how≠
ever, one thing that remained 
constant was the high level of 
energy, which was established 
right away with the hits ìYou 
May Be Rightî and ìMoviní Out.î
Not only did Joel put on an 
exceptional concert musically, but 
his phenomenal stage presence 
made the show even more enter≠
taining. Of particular note was 
Joelís sense of humor, which, as 
always, was witty and silly. Early 
in the show, he apologized for the 
two postponements and said tfrat 
he wanted to pretend to trip and
get hurt on stage and have some≠
one tell the crowd that the show 
would need to be postponed again. 
Joel also explained that he could 
have played in November with
crowd could also be felt in some of Day s Night.î Joelís tribute was 
the other fast-paced songs like quite fitting because, as he ex≠
plained, the Beatles were one of 
his largest influences in becom≠
ing a musician.
ìScenes From An Italian Res-
ìMy Life,î ìAngry Young Man,î 
and ìOnly The Good Die Young.î
It is during performances like 
the flu, but sang a few verses of these that it becomes easy to for- 
ìMoviní Outî to demonstrate what get that Billy Joel will be turning taurant,î which was the last song 
he would have sounded like if 50 later this year. But perhaps before the encore, was one of the 
he had. the wildest that Joel got during finest performances of the
Joel made light of his personal the show was during ìItís Still evening. While the song itself is 
Rock and Roll To Meî when he an outstanding demonstration of 
started doing tricks with the mi- Joelís genius as a songwriter, the
way he and his
life when he introduced ìSum≠
mer, Highland Fallsî as a song he 
wrote for his first 
ex-wife and ìThis 
Is The Timeî as 
one written for 
his second. Both 
of these were 
quite refreshing 
to hear because 
they are two in≠
credible songs 
that Joel has sel≠
dom performed 
duringpast tours.
ìSummer,
Highland Falls,î 
which was never 
a commercial suc≠
cess, has always 
been very popu≠
lar among his 
ìhard-coreî fans 
and has been per≠
formed at many 
of the shows dur≠
ing this tour. This 
outstanding pi≠
ano ballad from 
1976 was per≠
formed beauti≠
fully and clearly 
and showcased 
how his voice has
become deeper and richer over 
the years.
After these two slower songs, 
Joel picked up the pace again 
with a performance of ìDonít Ask 
Me Whyî and brought virtually 
everybody in the Arena to their 
feet. Similar energy from the
band played the 
crowd was a true 
testament to their 
aptitude as enter≠
tainers.
At one point, 
Mark Rivera, 
who plays the 
saxophone, ran 
into the crowd 
and performed 
his solo.
As usual, Joel 
strapped on his 
harmonica and 
concluded with 
ìPiano Man,î a 
classic song that 
many people feel 
is the essence of 
who Joel is.
The song 
brought almost 
the entire crowd 
to their feet to 
sway back and 
forth with one 
another. In one of1

moments of the 
evening, the band

By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffiuriter
Rather than just being a place to see a 
second-run movie last Friday night, 
IVJcConomy auditorium played host to 
Comedy Centralís Upright Citizens Bri≠
gade (UCB) in a show sponsored by the 
Activities Board. The show was divided 
into two halves ó a sketch comedy seg≠
ment much like their television pro≠
gram, followed by an improvisational 
performance. Although it is not the most 
universally recognized sketch comedy 
team, the Upright Citizens Brigadeís 
coriibination of inanity and mayhem with 
a large dose of deadpan made for some 
really sharp comedy.
The first half of the performance served 
as'a trial run for the new material that 
the troupe is working on for its televi≠
sion show. The section revolved around 
the theme of the cast presenting 
the ìFirst Annual Spirituality Expo,î 
culminating in a viewing of what
they dubbed the ìSpa≠
ghetti Jesus.î
The UCB quickly in≠
formed the audience that 
they were not to be taken 
seriously with an opening 
sketch with a creature 
called a ìMud Golemî who 
mopped the floor when 
heckled. UCB member 
Trotter then came out and 
introduced the ìExpoî 
theme of the show, and 
the rest of the group,
Adair, Antoine, and lone 
female Colby, introduced 
themselves as the show 
went on. From then on, 
the group moved through The Upright 
a dizzying number of 
sketches and costume changes, loosely 
bound by the spirituality theme. Trot≠
ter played a scientologist named Duke 
Thompson, who tried to cure a character 
played by Antoine of left-handedness.
Brian Yeung/Tartan Photo Staff 
Citizens Brigade performed in McConomy last Friday.
Adair offered a comedian, whom he had 
ìcolor blindedî with a pair of red goggles, 
a choice between pig anuses and an 
apple and ó well, you get the idea.
Nothing I explain is going to seem re≠
motely sensible.
The UCB worked on a 
pretty sparse stage, with 
no decorations and only a 
few props. They fre≠
quently switched between 
their UCB uniforms, usu≠
ally just ajacket and some 
sort of peculiar accessory, 
and character costumes. 
What makes their act so 
clever is that they act as if 
everything they do is per≠
fectly normal ó like 
theyíre not even trying to 
make the audience laugh. 
Talking in essentially the 
same loud voices the en≠
tire time, generally about 
nothing, their refusal to 
give up their serious facade provided 
much of the nightís comedy.
The sketches finally closed with the 
ìSpaghetti Jesusî bit, with an empty 
bucket that the members said contained
spaghetti resembling Jesusís face serv≠
ing as the centerpiece. The skit featured 
enough gross-out humor to make Thereís 
Something About Mary envious, and con≠
cluded with a clever Benny Hill-inspired 
chase scene. Next, the crew returned for 
a 20-minute improvisational bit, begin≠
ning with the audience-suggested theme 
ìpants,î which really went nowhere. 
From there, they moved rapidly through 
bit after bit, switching times, places, 
and concepts with nothing more than a 
word from one of the players.
Although not quite as clever as the 
prewritten segment, the improv part 
showed the Upright Citizens Brigadeís 
comedic talent and demonstrated a little 
bit about what goes on in the minds 
responsible for a crazy show. The ìíSpiri≠
tuality Expoî idea also showed promise 
ó an irresistibly witty sketch like that 
should work well on television. I hope 
some people get a chance to check it out, 
and I hope even more that none of those 
people ever consider taking it seriously.CMU faculty members present work at local gallery

Despite a torrent of freezing 
sleet outside, the Foreland Street 
Studio in the North Side held a 
successful opening of Carnegie
Mellonís faculty artwork last Sat≠
urday. The painting, drawing, 
and printmaking professors of the 
School of Art were represented in 
the second of three faculty exhi≠
bitions this year.
Many students and art lovers 
attended the opening of the show,
Anthony DíAuria/ Tartan Photo Staff 
On Saturday, professors of art opened their show at the Foreland Street Studios.
which features the work of 
professors of art Jon Beckley, 
Patricia Bellan-Gillen, Joann 
Maier, Herbert T. Olds, Susanne 
Slavick, Mary Weidner, dean of 
the College of Fine Arts, Martin 
Prekop, and visiting professor 
Clayton Merrell.
The displays range 
from social commen≠
taries, dichotomies, 
and illusionary plays 
in painting to unusual 
techniques in
printmaking.
Prekopís collage is 
certainly illusionary. 
His combination of 
faux fur, mirrors, and 
mantlepieces are remi≠
niscent of home inte≠
rior dÈcor. Artificial 
cowhide blends with 
paper images of fur, 
making the viewer 
uncertain of what is 
real and what is not.
Next to this piece is 
a set of paintings dis≠
played by Merrell. Al≠
though the landscape is a com≠
mon motif in the history of 
painting, Peeled Sky, Seen from 
Behind shows that Merrell has 
an entirely unique way of per≠
ceiving it. Two of his other paint≠
ings have horizons with 
trees on opposing sides of the 
picture plane.
Slavickís work focuses more 
on organic and sensual forms. 
Her piece, Geometry of Dreams: 
Target is a painting of a striped 
cushion with a button in the 
center. Contrary Comfort has 
soft, rounded shapes but is ren≠
dered in striking red. Solitary 
black spots, buttons, and red 
circles which resemble cells on 
mattresses are representative 
of points of entry.
Such starkness against 
plushy forms suggests what she 
described as ìdreams 
reconfigured to what is possible; 
or as targets which you shoot 
for metaphorically, but also 
shoot at you.î
Slavick used layers of thinly 
applied paint to reach a rich,
glowing effect, a technique 
reminiscent of Northern Re≠
naissance painting.
In contrast, Weidner empha≠
sized the power of quick, expres≠
sive brush strokes. Her piece, We 
are the wounders, we are the heal≠
ers, depicts 20 images represen≠
tative of the human heart. From 
gesturing figures on operating 
tables to painterly, bleeding 
hearts, her work seems to ques≠
tion whether physical pain or 
emotional pain is more powerful.
Primarily a printmaker, 
Bellan-Gillen also makes use of 
a variety of painting techniques. 
She creates symbolic images 
of animals, often those closely 
related to humans. Repeated 
forms of a monkey include a 
miniature double-helix 
modethat can be seen only with 
close examination.
Her technique contrasts with 
the work of Maier, another 
printmaker, who used lasers 
and computer-generated im≠
ages in combination with tradi≠
tional intaglio to create detailed
surfaces with colors and forms 
that look radioactive. Maierís 
art holds an affinity with the 
technical setting of CMU, mak≠
ing a science out of printmaking.!
On another level, the piece by 
Beckley contains a sub-textual 
social commentary. His work, 
which occupied an entire room, is 
composed of layers of various dis≠
carded facade material.
Beckley said that the layers, 
are representative of an; 
impliedpresentand a concealed; 
past. His piece describes a! 
ìthrow-awayî culture in society I 
that is full of masked surfaces. 
It suggests an aversion to a 
hyper-consumerist society.
Lastly, Herbert T. Olds dis≠
played three pieces of art that 
testify to his expertise in draw≠
ing the human figure.
In an untitled piece Olds care≠
fully rendered a woman crouch≠
ing in the fetal position with 
a very detailed back. Oldsís 
work added to the success of the 
eclectic show, which will run 
through April 6.

Bugsy Malone
Who would have ever thought that there would be 
a gangster movie that would include whipped cream- 
shooting machine guns and musical acts? In Bugsy 
Malone, that is just the case. The bad guys even 
break out into song at random moments.
Bugsy Malone was directed in 1976 by Alan Parker 
(Evita) with music by John Williams. With a cast 
made up entirely of kids including the young Jodie 
Foster (Contact) and Scott Baio (Happy Days) in 
leading roles, the movie provides slapstick comedy 
and noteworthy entertainment which led to Oscar 
and Golden Globe nominations. With credits like 
that, itís got to be good.

Star Trek: Insurrection
All right, all of you Trekkies out there! Donít 
try and hide yourselves. Iím talking about you! 
Insurrection is the latest installment in the Star 
Trek odyssey. However, remember that this is an 
odd-numbered Trek, so you cannot really expect 
too much plot from the film; and, fear not, 
you wonít be getting much, but the movie is 
still entertaining.
An alien race is trying to take over a planet that 
has magical properties, and it is up to Captain 
Picard to protect the residents of the planet from 
impending doom. Featuring Patrick Stewart 
as Picard, Jonathan Frakes as Riker, Brent Spiner 
as Data, and LeVar Burton as Geordi, this film 
is sure to be filled with the action-packed nerdiness 
that we all know and ó even though you may

Leprechaun Marathon
In honor of St. Patrickís day next Tuesday, AB 
will be showing, not Irish films, but a Leprechaun 
Marathon. The series of leprechaun movies is 
guaranteed to be a night full of the campy horror 
that has come to exemplify the leprechaun genre. 
However, these gruesome films are not to be 
taken seriously. After all, itís difficult not to keep 
yourself from laughing at a pint-sized Irishman 
who is trying to protect his lucky pot of gold.
Filled with ridiculous amounts of gore and 
of course the little green man himself, these films 
promise to provide a night of insanely

Exorcise the Demons 
Science/Astralwerks
One of the lamentable quali≠
ties about jungle albums is the 
tendency for them to be little more 
than collections of singles with 
filler thrown in, ostensibly to 
reach that 74-minute goal. This 
has led to many well-intentioned 
but decidedly mixed albums by 
artists such as Grooverider, Ed 
Rush & Optical, and Goldie.
Unfortunately, the duo Source 
Direct has not avoided this prob≠
lem on Exorcise the Demons, their 
first full-length effort. Out of the
nine tracks, two have been previ≠
ously released on the Controlled 
Developments EP. What they lack 
in new material, however, they 
more than make up for that in 
their presentation.
Their music bridges the gap 
between labelmate and musical 
mentor Photek and the current 
ìtechstepî scene. On their ear≠
lier work, Source Direct sounded 
almost like a clone of Photek: 
paranoid melodies, heavy use of 
cymbals and hi-hats, and a stark 
minimalism that places almost 
all emphasis on the beat. For this 
album, the melodies are just as 
gripping and a few songs are al≠
most completely beat-driven.
This time, they added dark and 
claustrophobic bass sounds along 
with the flurry of drums.
For the most part, this makes 
for welcome listening. This is one 
of the few jungle albums that 
feels like an album, since most of 
the tracks have extensive musi≠
cal progressions. ìMind Weaverî 
effectively switches between sim≠
pler rhythms and hyperkinetic 
ones, making for a dizzying expe≠
rience. Add a sinister bass track, 
and itís a track for both the dance 
floor and the living room.
ìLove and Hateî sounds pre≠
cisely like the title; the music is 
surprisingly light and atmo≠
spheric at the beginning, but
later becomes dark and forebod≠
ing. Even the two previously re≠
leased tracks, ìCall & Responseî 
and ìCapital D,î are both works 
which combine the spare Photek 
style with some additional musi≠
cal meat.
With an emphasis on develop≠
ment over sheer danceability, 
Source Direct have created a win≠
ner of a debut. This is recom≠
mended for anyone who is either 
a fan of jungle or who has yet to 
hear its fractured beats. One can 
only hope that this is the first 
sign of a general trend of creating 
real and lasting albums.

By KATIE KOWALL
Tartan Staffwriter
Once noted as being the second most 
widely read English author after 
Shakespeare, Oscar Wildeís tales go be≠
yond the ones he wrote on the page. Al≠
though many know Wilde for the biting 
humor oiThe Importance of Being Earnest 
et al, and the rich description of A Picture 
of Dorian Grey, what many donít know is 
Wildeís own personal tale of scandal. 
Oscar Wilde was a gay man 
who lived a life of secrecy and eventu≠
ally . imprisonment because of his 
sexual orientation.
The 1996 play Gross Indecency: The 
Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, which 
is currently showing at the 
Public Theater in the South Side, 
takes a deeper look into Wildeís per≠
sonal life and the trials that sur≠
rounded his imprisonment.
Directed and produced by Marc 
Masterson, the cast features nine 
men, some young, some old, most, 
save Wilde and his lover Lord Alfred 
Douglas, playing more than one role 
throughout the course of the play.
Three senior Carnegie Mellon 
Drama students, Jon Skovron, 
Zachary Quinto, and Dan Kuhlman, 
appear in the cast. Quinto 
and Skovron are new to the City 
Theater stage.
The set of Gross Indecency is de≠
signed in a unique way. The audi≠
ence was divided into two halves, 
one on each side of the stage, which was 
plain and simple, set up to mimic a court≠
room. This creative setup did add a sense 
of exotic flair to the performance, al≠
though at times when the actors were
facing the other half of the audience, some 
lines were lost into the crowd. But it is always 
refreshing to see a new and creative use of 
stage space.
Costuming was simple. The men all wore 
black suits, except Bosey Douglas, who wore a 
gray suit with a pink carnation on the lapel, 
and Wilde himself, who wore maroon pants 
and a richly brocaded vest. Clothing was added 
and subtracted as necessary. Props were kept 
to a minimum, only added where needed to 
properly embellish the action on stage. The

visual aspect of the show was rich and 
warm and reflected late 19th-century 
British' pretentiousness to the properly os≠
tentatious extent.
The script, which was originally written where very proud.
by MoisÈs Kaufman, tells the story of Oscar 
Wilde and his struggle with whether his ho≠
mosexuality is morally acceptable or not. 
Throughout the play, portions are read from 
texts by those directly involved with the Wilde 
trials, but are neatly integrated into the action 
very smoothly.
All of the acting was excellent, with staging 
done perfectly as well. The actors never seemed 
to skip a beat ó they were always in the right 
place at the right time, and fully in character. 
Their ability to perform was most evident,at 
times when they would quickly switch 
character from one accent and man≠
nerism to another.
The transitions were smooth and 
almost unrecognizable throughout 
the performance.Special kudos goto 
Zachary Quinto, whose voice filled 
the theater with the richness and 
depth that only one of great talent 
possesses. Richard McMillan, who 
played Oscar Wilde, had the appro≠
priate flamboyant character, and wry 
expressions that gave him the air 
of the English playwright, poet, 
and novelist.
Overall, the performance was fresh 
and sharp. The actors were passion≠
ate and intimate with the material. 
They were not just acting for the sake 
of acting; they were feeling every 
word that they said.
Such a story of sadness might 
be hard to tell with the wit and cun≠
ning for which Oscar Wilde was so' 
well-known. But with an effective 
script, appropriate technical 
support, and excellent acting, Gross Inde≠
cency was all that one could hope for, arid 
more ó a mastery of the stage that should 
make the company and Wilde-lovers every-
Oscar leaves moviegoers with questions
OSCARS, from page L9
every scene with its sometimes 
raw and sometimes rich humor.
But the nomination it should 
have received was for best sup≠
porting actor. Unlike Billy Bob 
Thornton, whose inconsistent but 
Oscar-nominated performance in 
A Simple Plan did not come close 
to his Oscar-winning performance 
in Sling Blade, Kellyís acting and 
comic persona was commendable 
throughout Waking Ned Devine. 
Reasons as to why Kelly was not 
nominated may include the for≠
eignness, or maybe the ìluck of 
the Irishî simply does not travel 
to Hollywood.
And lastly, The Truman Show 
is perhaps the clearest example 
of the Academyís refusal to pay 
attention to what the critics and 
the public generally found to be 
an Oscar-worthy picture and a 
monumental performance for ac≠
tor Jim Carrey. Peter Weir, the 
filmís director, and Andrew 
Niccol, who wrote the screenplay, 
were nominated. However, 
Carrey, who played the innocent 
Truman Burbank, who learns as 
an adult that he has been leading 
a phony life merely to provide 
millions of viewers with a T.V. 
show about him, was not nomi≠
nated. And neither was Laura
Linney, who gave a remarkable 
performance as Trumanís wife. 
Critics praised the castís perfor≠
mances and the overall picture, 
but the Academy in Hollywood 
thought differently.
Nevertheless, the Academy suc≠
ceeded in recognizing more inde≠
pendent films this year than last 
year, when Titanic sunk valu≠
able films such as Eveís Bayou 
and The Ice Storm. In one way or 
anothÈr, Miramaxís Hilary and 
Jackie,LittleVoice, and Gods and 
Monsters were included this year. 
And Life is Beautiful, from the 
Italian director Roberto Benigni, 
received seven nods.
Despite its omissions, the Acad≠
emy had most of its act together 
this year. Perhaps what movie≠
goers must remember is that the 
ìforgotten filmsî do not have to be 
forgotten. Five thousand points 
of view cannot possibly represent 
the millions of opinions coming 
from viewers.
After all, I doubt that every≠
one rooted for How Green Was 
My Valley in 1941. Even if Citi≠
zen Kane had not been nomi≠
nated at all, it would have been 
found eventually, and it would 
probably still be considered by 
critics to be one of the greatest 
movies of all time.
