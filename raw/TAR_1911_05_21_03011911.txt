Dr. Mcllvaine’s Address to Science Men
“The Hand of God in Our American History.”
Last Thursday morning Dr. Mcllvaine delivered 
the third of the course of lectures that are to be 
given to the Science men this semester. It was a 
very finely delivered address and one which was en­
joyed and appreciated by all who heard it. Dean 
Leete introduced Dr. Mcllvaine, who said in part: 
Long before there was any indication of life on 
this planet this land was being prepared and fitted 
up to be the home of a great and mighty nation. 
The geysers were hewing out with their hot chisels, 
and the glaciers were pounding with their cold ham­
mers, the mighty hurricanes were cleaving with 
their lightning strokes, the earthquakes were heav­
ing and distributing the earth’s crust, the waves 
of the ocean, were cutting and grinding out harbors 
and bays on our coast, and great torrents of rain 
were forcing their way to the sea, through the great 
lakes and water courses of the interior. Gigantic 
forests were drinking in the carbon of the atmos­
phere, assimilating it and storing it away to die, 
petrify and to be buried in deep veins, to become

the coal fields for coming generations. Animal and 
vegetable matter were being put away and com­
pressed into petroleum and natural gas for the light 
and heat of multitudes yet unborn. Mineral treas­
ures of vast extent and variety were being stored 
away in the secret veins of the mountain, and 
fields and prairies boundless in extent were being 
enriched with the decay of vegetation century after 
century and the return to the soil of animal sub­
stance taken from it. In this way, by some kind of 
care and forethought and intelligent preservation we 
have today the richest and fairest, most fertile land 
that the sun shines upon. For ages this land wras 
being fitted and prepared for whatever necessities 
or luxuries civilization may require, for government, 
industry or commerce, ' education, charity, or re­
ligion.
Another thing is worthy of our notice here,— 
during all the ages of the past this great land was 
safely hidden from all the nations of the earth until 
the people who were to possess it were ready for it.

4THE TARTAN
Even the hordes of Asia, pressed and crowded for 
room, and separated from us only by a narrow strip 
of water 36 miles wide, lived and died for thousands 
of years in utter ignorance of the wonderful ad­
vantages and riches so near them. The treasures 
of this land were undiscovered until the right time 
came, then the curtain was lifted and this new world, 
with all its wealth and glory, was revealed to man; 
and while the land was being prepared the people 
who were to possess it were also being made ready 
lor it.
We get a glimpse of that training far back through 
the pages of German history, the Teutonic influ­
ences stamping upon our ancestors the characteris­
tics that were to crown their life, and this training 
was transferred to the shores of Britain with these 
characteristics of energy, truthfulness and inde­
pendence. And in addition to this, that part of the 
race destined for this country was still further 
tested by adversity and persecutions because of 
of their religious principles, and the sacrifice of 
hearts and lives for the sake of liberty, all of which 
tended to give increased strength and solidity and 
endurance to their character. Then the Protestant 
Reformation and the open Bibles brought an in­
creased sense of responsibility and relationship to 
God. Indeed, it has truthfully been said that “God 
sifted the world for wheat to sow the American 
wilderness.”
But that training was only begun when our fathers 
landed on these shores. Three enemies opposed 
them:—the climate, the wilderness and the savage. 
There was the deadly malaria at Plymouth and 
Jamestown; so many of the first settlers succumbed 
to the ravages of the disease that these colonies 
were like a candle in the wind. Then, before the 
remaining few stretched an unbroken wilderness. 
There were three little dots on the coast, and all 
the rest was primeval forest, and through that forest 
stole with stealthy tread the enemy of progress and 
civilization. They could easily have wiped these 
little bands of settlers into the sea, but the same 
hand that guided them there restrained the strong 
hand of the enemy until they were ready to meet it. 
How can you account for the neutrality of the Iro­
quois during those seven long years of the French 
and Indian war? The same hand that of old shut 
the mouths of the lions now restrained the fall of 
the tomahawk.
These pioneers, overcoming the opposition thus 
before them, were made wise, industrious, strong. 
Then, and not until then, the rich fertile plateus 
of the interior were opened, and a great impulse 
was given to the nation. After the nation had be­
come agricultural and mechanical, then the great 
gold fields of the West were discovered. If you 
think that this was mere chance with no intelli­
gence or forethought, suppose for a moment that 
this were reversed and that the discovery of gold 
had come first, with its evil influence and wild spec­
ulation. Would even the spirit of the Puritans have
been proof against the disease which had struck the 
spirit of the Mexican-soldiers and could be cured 
only by “gold dust?” Can we not see here some­
thing of that forethought and divine foresight that 
marks our history as a great nation?
Then came the struggle for political liberty. I do 
not need to remind you of the familiar events lead­
ing to our republic. But notice a few facts that seem 
to indicate something more than the blind work of 
our natural or ethnic forces. The colonists did not 
desire separation from the Mother Country. They 
were forced into it by a blind and selfish policy 
that made them the mere hewers of wood and draw­
ers of water for British ambition. But what could 
such a discordant, feeble, disunited band of colonies 
do against the foremost nation of the world, whose 
fleets held the whole sea in awe? That farmer fight 
at Lexington, Washington at the head of our armies, 
the hardships of that winter at Valley Forge, the 
surrender of Cornwallis, and the recognition of our 
political independence after seven years of war— 
surely we are an ungrateful people if we do not 
recognize something of the hand of God in our his­
tory.
The struggle was to be taken up again for liberty, 
this time in the struggle for the liberty of being a 
human race. Was there not something like an un­
seen hand guilding the personal friendships, the sec­
tional jealousies and political animosities that called 
Lincoln to the front He hesitated to strike at the in­
stitution that lay at the root of the difficulty. Many 
SIX—Tartan
men could not understand why Wendell Phillips 
called Lincoln a traitor and the war a failure; but 
wisdom kept Lincoln quiet until the time was ripe, 
then he spoke and the nation answered. I can re­
member in 1863, when I was a college student like 
you, when gloom and despondency spread over the 
North and threatened the Capitol of the nation, the 
weak-hearted were calling for peace even at the cost 
of the dissolution of the Union. A great crowd had 
gathered about the State House in Boston waiting 
for tidings from the seat of war. News of the double 
victory of Vicksburg and Gettysburg came and 
brought forth great shouts and tears of joy. These 
men could not voice their praise and gratitude suf­
ficiently that way so they sang “Praise God from 
whom all blessings flow” and it swelled up into a 
mighty chorus, and many men who would before 
hardly admit the existence of a divine being were 
glad to join in that strain of thanksgiving.
All our national problems in the past have been 
problems of human brotherhood. In 1774 the great 
question was—how shall this people, with all its 
sectional difficulties and animosities and revelries; 
how shall this band of colonies live together in 
brotherhood as one great free nation? And our 
fathers wrestled with the problem and naturally 
solved it. The great question of religion is the ques­
tion of brotherhood. The answer to that question is 
—a free Church and a free state, that the religious 
institutions of the public such as spring from the

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN6
individual life, and the people and state shall not at­
tempt its coerceion, and that no animosity shall be 
in their religious fellowship.
Then came the question of education. What does 
brotherhood owe to the children of the poor in our 
midst? The answer was the public school. Human 
brotherhood owes everything in education to the 
poorest among us.
Then came the question of industry. That is one 
of the great questions before us today. The ques­
tion of slavery was—what does brotherhood owe to 
4,000,000 of slaves in the midst of us? The answer 
solved through a bloody war. The question of in­
dustry is—how shall the mechanic, the mill worker, 
the employer and the employe, vast combines of capi­
tal and labor, how shall they live together? Not in 
groping competition, in grinding monopolies and de­
structive strife, but in mutual cooperation, helpfully, 
peacefully and prosperously as one great brother­
hood. That is the problem before the people of the 
Twentieth Century. These people which have been 
brought together from all quarters of the world, how 
shall they live together peacefully and prosperously 
in so great a nation? Not as Americans merely, but 
as brothers. That is the problem that is before us. 
That is the problem that you young men are going 
to help to solve, and I envy you what you are going 
to see during this century which we have entered. I 
do not envy you your hopes; we ought to grow more 
hopeful. Nor do I envy you your courage nor your 
enthusiasm which means God in the human soul, but 
I envy you your opportunity in the share you are 
going to have in the solution of these problems.
As I look back it seems to me it would have been 
a great thing to have lived in the days of the revolu­
tion and to have had some hand in the shaking off 
of the English yoke, it would have been a great thing 
to have lived in the sixties of the last century and 
helped to break the shackles of the slaves. This, 
however, is to be the greatest century, in its ad­
vantages and possibilities. I envy you the battles 
you are going to fight and the labor you are going 
to do, and the problems that you are going to solve, 
in trying to teach the world how a great nation like 
this with all its aggressive enterprises, shall live to­
gether as one human brotherhood. And I believe 
you are going to do it, because I do not believe that 
God has been working in vain through all the cen­
turies. The problems that He has been working 
out He will continue to work out until a solution is 
reached, and as I look out through the curtains of 
the cuture and get a glimpse of that which is to come, 
the land which I hope I shall look down on in the 
far off years, what I seem to see is something like 
this: A land with the Church and schoolhouse on 
every hillside and in every village, a land in which 
the factory bell rings like the church bell, and over 
every factory and work-shop is written in letters of 
gold that every man can read, “Do unto others as ye 
would that men should do unto you.”
ALLEGHENY WINS AGAIN.
In an exciting game with Allegheny College at the 
Field House, Tech was defeated on Saturday, Feb­
ruary 25th. The game was the best exhibition of 
basket ball seen on the home floor, and was won by 
the heavier team only after a hard struggle. Dur­
ing the greater part of the first half the contest was 
evenly divided, and the score was tied at 6. Then 
weight began to tell and the half ended 11—7 in 
favor of the visitors.
The scoring started with a foul thrown by R. Wil­
liams, which was soon followed by a field goal by 
Hawk. DuBarry scored the first goal from the floor 
for Tech on a long shot that was a beautiful speci­
men of skill. Douthett was seen on the ’Varsity for 
the first time at center during the first half; the lit­
tle Plebe covered himself with glory against Hawk, 
the star of two seasons. In this period, the Alle­
gheny center located the basket but once, and 
Croasman, a forward, secured the other two field 
goals.
In the second half Keltz went in at center. The 
big man has been on the sick list for some time, but 
it was hoped that he would strengthen the team­
work, besides adding to the score by individual abil­
ity. Mandeville was sent in at forward for R. Wil­
liams. The half started off at top speed and the 
game was kept going till the finish at a heart-break­
ing rate. It is not often that Dame Fortune is given 
credit is given credit in a basket ball game, but she 
must get some recognition for that second half. The 
ball would run around the rim and fall outside again 
and again when a member of the home team shot, 
but it always dropped through the net on the same 
kind of a shot by Hawk. In this manner, and with 
the excellent team-work of the visitors, the Alle­
gheny center netted five more goals for his side. 
Firestone played a great game at guard.
For Tech, Keltz and DuBarry starred in the second 
half. Capt. Williams was also in the game at all 
times and kept the teams going at a fast pace, as is 
his habit. The line-up:
Carnegie Tech—13. Allegheny—32.

For the past two weeks the Tartan has been of­
fering special inducements to those members of the 
student body that were not already on the subscrip­
tion list. Business Manager McCorkle reports that 
many men have taken advantage of this offer and 
have become subscribers for the rest of the year. 
There are, however, many more men who have not 
done so to date and it is to them that this notice is 
given. This offer, a subscription for the remainder 
of the school year for the sum of fifty cents, does 
not hold good after 9.30 P. M. Friday, March 3rd. If 
you have not yet seen about subscribing do so at 
once. If you don’t, remember that it is upon your 
shoulders alone that you can place the blame of caus­
ing this triple loss: loss to you, to the Tartan, and 
to Tech.
Owing to the absence of Dean Connelly from the 
city the Dean’s column will not be filled this week. 
Judging by the amount of favorable comment from 
the readers of the Tartan, the Dean’s column ap­
pears to be an excellent innovation.
The articles that have appeared so far have been 
of a very interesting and instructive character and 
have no doubt afforded food for thought to the 
reader. There have been a number of thoughts ex­
pressed which are very applicable to our everyday 
school ife. For instance, in a recent issue, Mr. 
Leete says: “There has never been a period in the 
history of a country when there was such need as 
now for men of altruistic motive—men who are 
willing to sacrifice their personal gain to the public
good. In business, in the church, in civic organiza­
tions, there is a great unrest which is only waiting 
capable and disinterested leadership to accomplish 
much needed reforms.” Now this thought might be 
applied to a need of intelligent and enthusiastic 
participation in the activities of these schools. 
What better environment is there for the engender­
ing of an altruistic purpose than that found right 
here—an environment full of opportunities for those 
who are willing to sacrifice a little of their time to 
a participation in the student affairs of these 
schools? Tech needs more fellows who are willing 
to sacrifice a littl6 of their personal interest; fel­
lows of altruistic motive who are willing to assume 
official office and discharge the duties of same con­
scientiously and to the best of their ability.
Also, Mr. McGoodwin says that “the activities of 
the good citizen will not generally be confined 
within the limits of his strictly professional life. He 
must perforce touch the life of his time and com­
munity in many affairs more or less unrelated to his 
professional work and skill. His total usefulness 
as a citizen will be measured to a large degree by 
the enthusiasm, understanding and wisdom with 
which he influences these affairs.” How is a fellow 
going to get in touch with the life of his time and 
community afterwards and be able to influence his 
fellows and their affairs if at present, while in 
school,. he lives like a hermit? One of the func­
tions of school’s activities is to bring such a fellow 
out of his shell and induce him to mix with his fel­
lows and thereby give something of himself. It will 
pay the student to read the dean’s column very care­
fully because the statements contained therein are 
but the reflections of impressions gained by the 
Deans through long experience, hence are profitable 
to those who would gain by them.
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL SOCIETY.
This coming Saturday evening at 8.15 P. M. the 
Carnegie Mechanical Society will hold its regular 
monthly meeting.
H. R. Thayer, M. S. assistant professor of struc­
tural design in the Civil Department of these schools 
has kindly consented to give a talk on bridge con­
struction. Mr. Thayer has a number of interesting 
lantern slides with which to illustrate his talk. He, 
in his capacity of teacher, is used to lecturing and 
therefore will be able to touch upon those points 
that will be of interest to those present.
It is to be hoped that there will be a good turnout 
at this meeting.
Refreshments will be served as usual after the 
lecture.
The men of the University of Wisconsin are form­
ing an organization called the “Anti-Co-ed Club,” the 
object being the discouragement of fussing. Per­
haps a better name would be the “Tightwad Club.”

[Ed. Note:—We take great pleasure in calling to 
your attention this column. It has long seemed to 
us that there were a great many interesting things 
in our life at Tech which, while not in any sense of 
the word important, were worth noticing and record­
ing. Our difficulty lay in the obtaining of a mind 
which wandered far enough afield to see and note 
those things which ordinarily escape amid the rush 
of Calculus and the rest. At last we have found 
such a mind and will publish intermittently the re­
sults. We say intermittently because we are not 
at all sure that we can rely upon our find to turn in 
copy enough to fill the column each week.
We hope and trust that the “observations” set 
forth hereinafter will be enjoyed by all, and that no 
one will be offended if the mild arrow of gentle criti­
cism is turned their way.]
It seems to me that the poor man has two ad­
vantages over the rich man. First, he is less liable 
to have curvature of the soul, and second, he is in 
no danger of having curvature of the stomach.
The reason that Mr. Zeller’s hair stands so beau­
tifully on end is because he rubs his hand through it 
every time he takes his hat off.
Mr. Field is fond of red ties and smokes “wedding 
cake.”
Question: Do a few unclipped black hairs on the 
upper lip constitute an artistic temperament?
Mr. Lightner is one of the best athletes on the 
Faculty and the poorest smiler.
“Six-foot” Brown is growing a very fine pair of 
“Sunny Jim” side-burns.
Mr. McCulloch comes from Springfield and has 
acquired the “Dry Slitz” habit since his arrival.
GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS.

Association, Friday, March 3d, at 8 P. M. Evening 
dress as usual. Watch bulletin board for further

TWO ALUMNI MARRIED 
“Buck” Thompson and “Jimmy” Jones Married Last 
Week
Within a day of each other “Buck” Thompson and 
“Jimmy” Jones were married, “Buck in New York 
City and “Jimmy” in Youngstown. Jones won out by 
the narrow margin of 23 hours.
James W. Jones, Science 1910, was married in 
Youngstown, Ohio, to Miss Helen Seidner on Feb­
ruary the 20th. Jones entered Tech from Youngs­
town and lived at Woodlawn Club the greater part 
of his undergraduate life. He was a very popular 
man and a member of Sigma Rho fraternity.
Meldrim Thompson, who was married in New York 
City the following day to Miss Marion Booth, entered 
Tech from Savannah, Georgia, with the class of 1909. 
He was one of the most popular men in his class 
and gained much renown as manager of the football 
team for two seasons. It was mostly through his 
work in that direction that our football is on the 
plane that it is today. Just where he picked up the 
“Buck” is not fully known.
Mr. and Mrs. Jones are to make their home in 
Youngstown and Mr. and Mrs. Thompson in the 
“Honeymoon” Flats, Woodlawn avenue, Pittsburgh, 
at which place a reception was tendered them upon 
their arrival.
ADDITIONAL MODELS IN STRUCTURAL 
ENGINEERING.
Junior Civils, Allen, Buente, and Kaul are working 
on a knee-braced roof truss, to be used as a model 
for Structural Design. Like others already built, it 
will resemble real construction, although reduced in 
size; in this case the scale is one-sixth. The trusses 
will be of the Fink type, 8 ft. long, 2 ft. high, 
and * ft. 6 in. apart; from floor to bottom chord is 
3 ft. 6 in. Posts at each end will support them, 
v.ae-eighth inch rivets in plates one-eighth inch 
thick will connect the members, which are gen­
erally of two angles, %x%x%, or ^x^xl-lG in.
Sophomore Mechanical Murphy is working on the 
Experimental Trusses. There are five of these; a 
Pratt, a Howe, and a Warren bridge truss, a Fink 
and a triangular roof truss. These are so designed 
that any member may be removed and spring bal­
ances substituted. If weights are now placed upon 
the structures, the increased readings of the bal­
ances show the stress caused by these weights. 
Provision is also made that later on measuring de­
vices for showing ueflection of trusses and change 
of length of the different members may be installed.
It is hoped that the appropriation will also suffice 
to finish the Pratt Highway truss, already in the 
drawing room, and to complete a model floor beam, 
a viaduct tower and an elevated standpipe.

The second inter-class basket ball game between 
the Seniors and Plebes took place on Monday, Febru­
ary 20. The Plebes came on the floor with the firm 
determination of taking the game, and at the end of 
the first half, when the score stood 10—9 in favor 
of the Plebes, the Seniors decided that it was time to 
get busy. Three field goals within the first three
minutes of play in the second half gave the Seniors
the lead, and the score at the end of the game was 
24—18 in favor of the Seniors. Line-up:
Seniors—24. Plebes—18.

Since we are getting ready for the base ball sea 
son, why not arrange a schedule for inter-class 
games similar to the basket ball? The basket ball 
contest has been a decided success in every way, 
and these class games help keep up the good fellow­
ship between the different classes.
SCRUBS LOSE
As a preliminary to the Allegheny-Tech game on 
Saturday night, the Monongahela Division of the R. 
R. Y. M. C. A. won from the Carnegie scrubs by a 
score of 19 to 11. The contest was warm and in­
teresting. Hawkins starred for the “Red Shirts” 
with five field goals and three fouls. Ballinger and 
Quinlan showed the best floor-work for the hopefuls, 
and the team-work of the home five was beautiful at 
times. The visitors also evidenced previous experi­
ence together. The score:

JUNIOR MECHANICAL’S TRIP.THEN AND NOW.
In line with the course of study being given on 
gearing to the Junior Mechanicals by Professor Fol­
lows, a trip was made by that class to the Nuttall 
Gear Works, downtown, last Friday afternoon. The 
class turned out in full force to make individual ob­
servations of the various methods of cutting gear 
teeth. Certain points, hitherto shrouded in mys­
tery, were cleared up. A question which had hith­
erto given cause quite a number of heated discus­
sions between Mr. Alfred Ormston and Mr. Frank 
Dalas of the class was settled during the trip. Al­
fred held that there was only pure rolling and Frank 
stoutly claimed that there was only the purest kind 
of sliding at the pitch point on the line of centers of 
two gear wheels in action. Unfortunately to the 
detriment of the higher education these odontic de­
bates usually took the form of a little floor-wiping, in 
which the action of rolling and sliding was demon­
strated to the delighted, surrounding non-combat­
ants. The matter was submitted, however, to the 
personal observation of the class for decision, and 
it was decided that both were wrong, and that there 
was only the purest kind of unadulterated shoving 
between the gear wheels at that point. Frank and 
Alfred made a bee line for the nearest friendly 
hostelry and resumed therein pleasant relations.
Lovers on an evening sweet,
Close we walk along the street.
Hand in hand? No, we’d be caught!
So we work this little plot:
One of hers and one of mine 
In my pocket all the time 
As we journey, not too fast,
Through our courtship days, now past.
Married now, the best of wives,
We walk together all our lives,
Hand in hand? No, that’s forgot.
Now she works this little plot:
Both of hers and none of mine 
In my pocket all the time.
And money journeys much too fast 
As our married days glide past.
G. F. Munroe, 1914.

At Lehigh the actual number of men dropped for 
failure in scholarship at the end of the term just 
closed was: Freshmen, 16; Sophomores, 5; Juniors, 
6; Seniors, 8—being 35 in all—or about 5 per cent, 
of the student body. Thirty-six men were placed on 
probation.
An erroneous report somehow was circulated that 
the dropped men amounted to ninety.
