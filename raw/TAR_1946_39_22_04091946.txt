Engineering and Fine Arts Colleges 
To Have Tuition Raised for Next Oct.
Tickets Placed On Sale Today; 
ODK Schedules Gala Weekend
Because of greatly increased costs of operations, Carnegie 
Institute of Technology has found it necessary to increase the 
tuition by $25 per semester in the College of Engineering and 
Science and the College of Fine Arts effective at the beginning 
of the fall semester on October 1. The tuition will be unchanged 
in Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. In all colleges there 
will be a single over-all fee combining the former tuition fee 
and “general fee.” The combined total fee in the College of 
Engineering and Science and the College of Fine Arts will be
$225 per semester.

Hot Combination
The Men’s Dorm Council Dance 
which was held at the Hotel 
Schenley from 9 to 1 last Saturday 
night, April 6, was a social suc­
cess and provided an outlet for 
those people who like to go to a 
dance informally. About 200 cou­
ples danced to the music of Clyde 
Knight and his orchestra. The se­
lection played were of sufficient 
variety to satisfy all those present 
and the two featured vocalists 
wer of better than average abil­
ity. Fruit punch was served at the 
soft-drink bar.
Kilroy showed up in the per­
son of Walter G. “Dagwood” Mc­
Pherson, dressed in parts of the 
uniforms of the various branches 
of the service. Kilroy carried with 
him a gold brick and a short-snor- 
ter and had the croix de guerre as 
well as the purple heart and other 
medals from the Army, Navy, etc.
Bill Ross was the able M. C. and 
played straight man to Kilroy, who 
would have met with greater suc­
cess if the audience had been more 
familiar with the legend concern­
ing his existence.
Ginger was probably in Schen­
ley Park “Schenley-Parking”—at 
least she never showed up at the 
dance. ’Tis rumored that “Old 
Rump” has contracted dipsomania 
from the female orang-utans of the 
upper Transylvania region, and 
couldn’t make it to the dance from 
his residence at the University 
Hotel.
The announcement of this ac­
tion by the Executive Committee 
of the Trustees was made today by 
President Robert E. Doherty.
Tuition rates in certain categor­
ies of the evening classes will al­
so be correspondingly increased. 
The charge for evening courses 
offered by the departments of the 
College of Engineering and Science 
and the College of Fine Arts will 
be increased to $4.20 per unit. 
Evening courses offered by the 
departments of Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College and the Division 
of Humanistic and Social Studies 
will remain at $3.60 per unit. The 
general fee has been eliminated 
for students in the evening divi­
sion.
The increase in tuition in the 
College of Engineering and Sci­
ence and the College of Fine Arts 
is necessary for several reasons. 
Perhaps the most obvious of these 
is the almost universal increase in 
costs everywhere throughout the 
country and the subsequent lower­
ing of the purchasing power of 
the dollar— a situation which con- 
fronts educational institutions 
along with private families and 
individuals. At Carnegie, more­
over, the cost of instructional 
services has risen sharply because 
the faculty has been considerably 
expanded in order to lighten 
teaching loads and thus increase 
the efficiency of instruction, and 
also because additional distin­
guished persons have been brought 
to the campus as members of the 
faculty. The increase in opera­
tional costs is further reflected in 
plans for expansion of the build­
ing facilities on campus. The pro­
vision of better dormitory accom-

Russian Vice-President 
Is Graduate of CIT
A Carnegie Tech graduate is the 
new Vice President of Soviet Rus­
sia. .
Upon the resignation of 71-year 
old Mikhail Kalinin, President of 
the USSR for the last 27 years, 
Vasili Vasilevich Kuznetsov (Met. 
’33) assumed the positions of Vice 
President of the Soviet Union and 
Chief Commissar of Labor Unions. 
He succeeds Nikolai M. Shvernik, 
his oid boss, who is now the Soviet 
President.
Kuznetsov, after getting his B. S. 
from the Leningrad Polytechnic 
Institute, was given the opportuni­
ty to continue his metallurgical 
studies in the United States. He 
chose Carnegie Tech as the college 
best suited for his studies. After 
a year’s residence, VaSili Kuznet­
sov was awarded the Master of 
'cience Degree, in 1933.
Kuznetsov was well-liked here, 
ne bt his former professors says: 
“He was one of the best students 
I ever had. He was very friendly 
and very much liked. American 
skill and technique impressed him 
deeply.”
Although as a rule Vasili Kuz-
etsov never discussed politics, he

did confide to a certain extent in 
his classmate, Dr. Rush Lincoln, 
now of the Allegheny Ludlum Re­
search Laboratories. Dr. Lincoln 
says: “Kuznetsov struck me as be­
ing a very high type of person. He 
told me that everything was not 
of the best in Russia, but that he 
hoped things could be ironed out. 
He said “the Russian people had 
to lose their rough edges and learn 
how to live.”
After leaving Tech, Kuznetsov 
worked for a year in a Detroit 
Ford plant, then returned to Rus­
sia. Last summer he made a CIO 
sponsored tour of the United 
States. Because of his many for­
eign contacts the Russians regard 
him as very cosmopolitan.
Apparently Vasili Kuznetsov 
was very much impressed by the 
United States, and liked what he 
saw here. When he returned to 
Russia he was so enthusiastic 
about his life and times in the 
United States that, under a bar­
rage of high praise for America, 
his friends asked, “Well, if you 
like it so much there, why don’t 
you go back?” But Kuznetsov 
stayed, and to very good effect.
New members of the Student- 
Faculty Committee of the College 
of Engineering have been chosen, 
and will hold the first meeting of 
the Committee since last spring on 
Thursday.
Men selected are Joseph P. 
Franz, August E Binder^ Jr., Clayd 
R. Mellott, and Richard L. Heck­
man. The only former member of 
the Committee in the group is 
Richard C. Eschenbach. Faculty 
members are Dr. Webster N. 
Jones, Dr. William R. Work, Dr. 
Douglas F. Miner, and Dr. B. 
Richard Teare, Jr.

Bill LeRoy’s Band 
In Gym April 13
The “Tecvet” Easter Parade will 
launch the Easter Festivities this 
Saturday night, April 13. The af­
fair will be an All-School Dance 
at the Gym from 9 P. M. to 1 A. 
M. In addition to the rhythmic 
melodies of Billy LeRoy and his 
Band, the dance will feature a 
unique contest for the most un­
usual and attractive “corsage” 
made of anything or everything 
but flowers. The best “corsage,” 
or “whatizzit” will get both the 
maker and the wearer a couple’s 
ticket for the Spring Carnival.
The eligibility rules for this con­
test are that the “corsage” be sup­
plied, and preferably manufac­
tured, by the escort and that it be 
worn by his partner. “Worn,” as 
used here, is defined as meaning 
“carried or borne upon the per­
son.” Any material may be used 
in making the decoration except 
a bloom or blossom created by 
Mama Nature.
Billy LeRoy and his band are 
well known here on campus. His 
most recent appearance was at the 
Shamrock Sham. This is his sec­
ond engagement for the “Tec- 
vets,” as his band supplied the 
music for their veterans’ dance at 
the Schenley several weeks ago.
Tickets will be on sale between 
11:30 and 1:30 at the entrance to 
Skibo from Tuesday through Fri­
day and from any Tecvet member. 
The cost is $2.00 per couple in­
cluding tax.
The interior of*the gym will be 
decorated the night before the 
event by a group of camouflage ex­
perts home from the service.
Committee was formed in July, 
1944, to provide a means for the 
students to acquaint the faculty 
with their opinions, criticisms, and 
suggestions to improve the effec­
tiveness of the College as an edu­
cational unit. Students with 
“gripes” _about courses in the cur­
riculum or suggestions for im­
provements are urged to see one 
of the members of the Committee, 
and if the criticism is justified and 
the suggestion sound, the faculty 
and student members will work 
together to try to effect an im­
provement. However it is a Liaison 
Committee, hence it works both 
ways.
Aims of the committee, as stat­
ed when it was founded, are:
1. Calling attendtion to prob­
lems which the students believe 
merit consideration.
2. Providing a source of student 
opinion in matters requiring stu- 
dent-faculty attention.
3. Helping to improve teaching 
methods.
4. Making investigations and ob­
taining information that will as­
sist in pursuing the preceding 
aims.
Weigle To Speak 
At IRC Meeting
The International Relations 
club will hold its usual Wednes­
day meeting, at 4:30 P. M. in room 
105 MMCC. The topic under dis­
cussion will be, The United States, 
The Bomb, and the World.
Mr. Jean Weigle, internation­
ally known educator, will be pres­
ent at the meeting and will con­
tribute to the discussion from his 
wide knowledge of International 
Affairs. Mr. Weigle has had ex­
perience as a professor both in 
America and in Europe. He was 
for seven years Physics Professor 
at the University of Pittsburgh, 
and was later asked by the Uni­
versity of Geneva to be Director 
of their Institute of Physics. He 
occupied that position for six 
years. Last December he was sent 
to London to the United Nations 
Education and Scientific Organ­
ization as the delegate for Switz­
erland.
t ote Today
11:30 to 2:00
The signing of George Olsen’s 
orchestra for Spring Carnival- has 
been announced by ODK Spring 
Carnival Committee chairman, Joe 
Nutter. George Olsen will bring 
his famous “Music of Tomorrow” 
to play for Tech students at the 
Saturday night semi-formal dance 
which concludes the Spring Car­
nival and Campus week activities.
Noted for distinctive dance and 
entertainment music, Olsen and 
his orchestra have recently devel­
oped a variety of skits which are 
making floor show history 
throughout the nation. Judith 
Blair, pert vocalovely with the 
band, is one of the reasons Olsen’s 
music is scoring new successes and 
is in constant demand. Ray Adams 
is the male vocalist featured with 
Olsen’s orchestra.
Along with the announcement 
of the signing of the orchestra is 
the information stating that tick­
ets are now on sale for the big 
weekend. Ticket chairman, Cloyd 
Mellott, has announced that the 
sale begins today. The price will 
be $5.00 plus tax, or $6.00, per 
couple for the weekend. Advanced 
sales will be made, and there will 
be only a given number on sale. 
They may be purchased from 
members of the Ticket Committee: 
Bob Crowe, Vince Benya, Anna 
Jane Zimmerman, Dottie Cavitt, 
Dottie Shupp, Betsy Eunson, Lois 
Williams, Jack Goodill, and Clara- 
bel Marter.
For the informal dance on Fri­
day night, Joey Sims orchestra 
will provide the instrumentation. 
Previous to the dance there will 
be the presentation of an hour 
and a half musical performance. 
During the whole evening there 
will be an informal Carnival at 
the booths and rides placed on the 
Cut.
Saturday, the big day, will see 
the Coronation of the Queen and 
Call Day in the morning. The first 
event of the afternoon will be the 
colorful Sweepstakes buggy races. 
Preliminary heats of this event 
will be run off on the Saturday 
before, and the three winners of 
the heats will compete for the 
championship at this time. Fra­
ternity and sorority booths and 
the rides placed on the cut—a 
ferris wheel and a miniature train 
—will fill the afternoon. The semi- 
formal dance in the evening will 
feature George Olsen, and will be 
the climax of Spring Carnival. 
Fraternities will conclude the big 
weekend with breakfasts in the 
houses after the dance.
This is the first post-war Spring 
Carnival. It will not be as grand 
as previous Carnivals, but marks 
the biggest event of the year at 
Tech. To make it possible to have 
the best Spring Carnival a year 
from now, Carnegie students will 
have to get together, join in the 
fun of the Campus Week, and help 
put Spring Carnival over.
Notice
- Foreign students at Tech 
have been invited by the Y- 
Cabinet to a get-together in 
the Union Thursday night at 
7:30. The party will be strict­
ly stag, with all the male for­
eign students plus members of 
the Y-Cabinet and the YMCA 
Committee of Guidance in­
vited.
The Cabinet is providing en­
tertainment and light refresh­
ments. - ' Tm

Welcome Back
Last week an event of great importance to the students 
of Engineering and ultimately to the students of the Colleges 
of Margaret Morrison and Fine Arts took place: the Student- 
Faculty Liaison Committee was revived.
The Student-Faculty Liaison Committee was one of the 
few good things to come out of the war years on the Carnegie 
campus. It was founded in the summer session of 1944 and con­
tributed a great deal to the improvement of student-faculty 
understanding and cooperation during tht following winter. 
Because the majority of its student members graduated in the 
spring of ’45 the committee was inactive last summer and did 
not resume its functions in the fall. Its revival comes rather 
late in the semester it is true, but we are extremely happy to 
see its return to the Carnegie Campus.
As was stated in the front page story, the aims of the organ­
ization are: 1) Calling attention to problems which the stu­
dents believe merit consideration by the faculty; 2) providing 
a source of student opinion in matters requiring student-faculty 
attention; 3) helping to improve teaching methods; and 4) 
making investigations and obtaining information that will as­
sist in pursuing the preceding aims. Those who originally 
organized the committee felt that although Carnegie Tech is 
considered one of the best colleges of its kind in the nation, the 
students might prove of real assistance in raising the standards 
of the institution by pointing out faults in teaching procedures 
that might easily go unnoticed by professors, by calling atten­
tion to problems which otherwise would be hidden sources of 
irritation for the students, and by undertaking research work 
which might lead to the modernization of the prevailing peda­
gogical philosophy at CIT. In its first year of operation the 
committee did work important enough to convince its founders 
that they had not overestimated the potential importance of 
the organization. It suggested changes in the procedure fol­
lowed in one of the engineering lab courses which were sub­
sequently made. It made a report on the use of the honor sys­
tem in other colleges and suggested a plan for its application at 
Carnegie. It also began research on the use of visual education 
in Engineering education. If the present committee is willing 
to devote a sufficient amount of time to the organization, the 
Student-Faculty Liaison Committee will come to hold a place 
of importance in the lives of both the students and the faculty 
of the Engineering school, and its activities will no doubt 
spread to Margaret Morrison and Fine Arts.
To The Faculty
Most of the students on campus laugh heartily when the 
Tartan staff refers to the publication as a “newspaper.” They 
claim that the only thing that the Tartan fails to offer its read­
ers is news. This year we have all been attempting to get some 
truly current occurrences into the sheet. In order to more 
thoroughly cover the happenings on campus, we have assigned 
to our reporters, cubs, and general flunkies “beats,” or perma­
nent sources of information. Many of these news sources are 
department heads and other professors. In the early part of 
the year our little reporters were very enthusiastic about cov­
ering their respective beats. They went faithfully each week 
to see the professors to whom they were assigned, but every 
week the answers they were given was “no news.” They also 
discovered that the professors frequently sent their news items, 
directly to the news bureau and that many of them were not 
exactly subtle in letting the cubs know that their frequent 
calls were annoying. The reporters therefore became discour­
aged. They stopped covering their beats. We are now 'Operate 
for departmental news. In fact we are reduced to a plea
to all the faculty members who come in contact ur re­
porters, asking them to give their news to their c Drters
when they get it and to cooperate a little with th( e rters.
A 'bit of good philosophy (a 
few sentences from Charles A. 
Beard) opens this week’s ex­
change column. It seems that the 
venerable historian was once ask­
ed if he could summarize the les­
sons of history in a short book. He 
said that he could do it in four 
sentences and proceeded to prove 
his statement as follows:
1. Whom the gods would de­
stroy, they first make mad with 
power.
2. The mills of the gods grind 
slowly, but they grind exceed­
ing fine.
3. The bee fertilizes the flower 
it robs.
4. When it is dark enough, you 
can see the stars.
A worthy condensation indeed, 
hut will the profs accept it in 
lieu of the date of the Boston Tea 
Party on a final?
Some months ago, a negro from 
Houston, Texas, by the name of 
Heman Marion Sweatt applied to 
the School of Law of the Univer­
sity of Texas. After a good bit of 
argument, some pro and some 
con, his application was finally 
turned down, reports the Daily 
Texan. Governor Coke R. Steven­
son is generously considering a de­
ficiency appropriation to set up a 
law course for Negroes at Prairie 
View University. This course will 
have a one-lawyer-faculty, one 
set of Texas statutes, and one set 
of law encyclopedias. It seems as 
though there is nothing like giving
a man an even chance at an edu­
cation.
After a few final chandelles and 
a quick buzz job for the specta­
tors, a P-59 Aircomet settled 
down at the airport of the Uni­
versity of Purdue, its last flight 
completed. Having been purchas­
ed by the University, it will be 
used by the aeronautics depart­
ment for search and display pur­
poses only. The P-59 was the first 
successful American jet fighter, 
but superior German counterparts 
rendered it obsolete before it was 
ready for mass production. Its 
successor, the P-80, was not put 
into production in time for full- 
scale combat use.

REPRINT
Certain people seem to be mis­
informed. We veterans know that 
the instructors here at Tech are 
mostly of the highest caliber, but 
some are certainly snafuing the 
detail by not changing their teach­
ing tactics to consider this seem­
ingly unwanted person — the ex-
G.I. (Boy! Does my ticket need 
punching! No clothes! No house! 
No Money! And how they treat me 
mean at Tech! Where are you, 
Chaplain?)
In other words, we duller vet­
erans aren’t absorbing what we 
should; and the old favorite, 
“You’ve had that in Z-100” isn’t 
right in my estimation and doesn’t 
lead to proper class discussion. So 
we keep quiet and suffer the con­
sequences. Every instructor should 
realize that we aren’t too sharp 
after being away from the class­
room for 4 or 5 years, and they 
should lecture accordingly. I 
know (and this just isn’t my per­
sonal opinion as I’ve discussed it 
with others) that the right ap­
proach can work wonders, be­
cause three of my Profs realize our 
plight; and although the material 
is new, results are obtained. Their 
attitude promotes thorough, easy­
going discussions, and a logical 
question doesn’t bring leers from 
the younger quiz kids in the class. 
(I too was a Whizzer White once, 
but my mind has been dulled 
somewhat by long formation fights 
over Germany and long, exhaust­
ing trips to Picadilly on short 
leaves.)
We realize that the staff has 
been tremendously over-worked 
and deserves a vacation; but still 
let us not forget the married vet­
erans, some with children, who 
are undergoing undue hardships 
to get that questionable sheep­
skin. None of the instructors are 
deliberating venting their resent­
ment on the veteran, I’m sure, 
but some should review their past 
practices and realize tbat some 
thoughtfulness and consideration 
will do wonders to stimulate these 
foggy brains of ours.
We veterans don’t want to start 
a civil war. We’ve done our gold- 
bricking in the service and now 
wish to work hard to take our 
rightful place in society as human 
beings. So please helD u* out and
don’t make us write any more let­
ters because these take time—and 
that I can’t afford.
Sincerely,
“An eager but battle 
fatigued-fllak-happy, 
ex-throttle-jockey.”
IS IT NECESSARY
I was walking along the cam­
pus the other day when I spied my 
old friend Moe. Seeing that his 
morale was low, I asked, “What’s 
the trouble Moe?” He said, “I 
came thirty miles today just to at­
tend two classes—one in chemistry 
lecture and one in Social Relations. 
I can see the value of the lecture 
in chemistry, but that Socr Rel. 
class is a waste of time! (Disgust­
ed look on his face) “I’m taking 
my second semester of Soc. Rel.,” 
Moe continued, “and before I take 
another semester of it, I’ll re­
nounce school and go to work.” 
I digested this last remark of 
Moe’s as he shuffled past me and 
down the Cut. Moe had spoken 
harsh words. Only a serious sit­
uation could compel Moe to leave 
school, for he likes the atmosphere 
of learning that pervades a col­
lege campus—and he dislikes the 
atmosphere manual labor! Yes, 1 
began to say to myself, something 
is decidedly wrong with the Soc. 
Rel. course when it effects Moe’s 
morale like that. I’ve had the 
same feeling about the subject my­
self and something ought to be 
done to remedy the situation.
After mulling the thing over in 
my mind, I stack it up in the fol­
lowing manner. I have thus fa* 
found my Soc. Rel. classes to be 
of almost zero value. I don’t say 
completely zero, for I do get about 
forty-five minutes of rest even 
though somebody is always break­
ing up my nap by talking about 
the value of the church in Medie­
val times, or somebody shouting 
something else by way of» contra­
diction. I stayed awake one day 
when the shouting was unusually 
loud and was rewarded in my ef­
forts by being very confused as to 
what the church actually did to 
change Medieval history. Moral: 
I should have remained asleep. 
The whole course seems to be a 
“snow-job.” (A “snow-job” is 
too much talking by a person who 
doesn’t want you to understand 
what he is saying.) If the pro­
fessor is one who likes to talk, he 
“snows” you. If he succumbs to 
democracy, and is willing to listen, 
you “snow” him. (At least you 
try. You’ve got to be good to 
“snow” a Soc. Rel. prof.)

short end of many Tech jokes.) 
As far as I’ve been able to ob­
serve, “Economics and Cultural 
Change” wouldn’t even make a 
good footnote for Barnes’ “Hist, of 
Western Civilization.”
It is said that the Soc. Rel. 
course is designed to equip the en­
gineer so that his contacts in the 
business world may be enriched 
by his knowledge of Cro-Magnon 
man or of Stonehenge. As a vet­
eran I don’t see it. The average 
veteran has been around enough so 
that he is able to discern what is 
essential from that which is non- 
essential. The civilian counter­
part of the veteran would need 
eight years of Soc. Rel. courses be­
fore he could be considered as 
knowing one-half of what the vet­
eran knows from experience. What 
does this mean? It means that the 
majority of veterans are here for 
a definite purpose. We want to 
learn. We don’t, however, want 
to be burdened with nonessen­
tials. We’ve dilly-dallied long 
enough under Uncle Sam. We 
mean business now. We want to 
learn procedures that are appli­
cable to our future.
As an individual, I advocate that 
students be allowed an elective 
subject in place of Soc. Rel. 
Why should a student be required 
to study antiquity when he could 
be studying subjects dealing with 
the present and future? We’re 
looking ahead, not behind. As an 
example, a student could select a 
foreign language in place of Soc. 
Rel. There’s nothing like a for­
eign language to help a student’s 
English mastery. It also gives 
him a medium by which he can 
advance himself in any profession. 
Well-educated people of today 
know at least one language be­
sides their own native tongue.
So there you have it. Moe and 
I both feel this way about our 
Soc. Rel. course. Through ex­
perience I know there are many, 
many more who feel as we do. 
Speak up, students. Write a letter 
to the editor, and let the school* 
know how you feel. Perhaps we 
can stir the Soc. Rel. department 
from its lethargy and get some­
thing worthwhile for our tuition 
money.
Sincerely,
Vincent J. Catullo

‘Life’ Goes To Beaux Arts Ball;
All Fine Arts Are Also Invited
Three Fraternities Closed by War 
Plan for Immediate Reactivation
Life goes to the Beaux Arts Ball 
and so should you if you are a 
student, alumnus, or member ot 
the faculty of Fine Arts. Life will 
cover the dance which is the first 
one held since the spring of 1938 
in its usual “Life-goes-to-a-party” 
style. Their photographers will be 
on hand at the dance on April 12 
to take pictures of the murals, 
skits, and costumes.
The theme of the dance this year 
is surrealism, and prizes are to be 
awarded for the best costumes. 
The Drama Department created 
several costumes which they ex­
hibited in the Amphitheater last 
Tuesday, April 2, to give people 
an idea of what is expected. The 
P. & D. Department is designing 
the murals for the foyer and Ex­
hibition Room, some of which 
have already been hung in the 
former. Prizes will be given for 
the most original and best design­
ed murals; a prize will also be
Sigma Xi Elects 
Eminent Seniors
Sigma Xi, national honorary so­
ciety which recognizes those peo­
ple who are outstanding in the 
fields of science and psychology, 
has announced its newly elected 
officers and members. This or­
ganization is not a student organ­
ization, but is composed of fac­
ulty members, graduate students, 
and exceptionally outstanding se­
niors. Membership is limited to 
graduate students at the doctorate 
level, or to those who have pub­
lished papers. These students are 
elected to associate membership, 
and some to full membership. The 
present officers are: President,
Professor Emerson Pugh; Vice- 
President, Professor C. W. Muhl- 
enbruch; Treasurer, Professor B. 
von Haller Gilmer; and Secretary, 
Professor Clara Jane Douglas. 
Those newly elected to full mem­

given for the cleverest skit on sur­
realism.
The music for the dance will be 
supplied by Maurice Spitalny’s 
orchestra, which is well-known 
around Pittsburgh.
The tickets for the dance, which 
are $3.60 a person, are not on sale 
this week but may be purchased 
at the door the night of the dance.
Carnegie To Get 
Housing For Yets
A contract has been signed by 
the government and Carnegie 
Tech for housing for veterans. 
Three buildings consisting of 8 
family units each, a total of 24 
family units, and accommodations 
for 200 single men will be erect­
ed. These buildings will be set 
up behind Laurel and Haw­
thorne Halls but will not in­
fringe on the play-ground.
The space beside the Union and 
on the Cut will not have to be 
used as was formerly thought.
The government has assured the 
administration that the units will 
definitely be ready by September 
and the family units may be com­
pleted by June.
Manual on Sale
Professor Watson of the Bureau 
of Measurement and Guidance has 
prepared A Manual of Study Tech­
nique for College Students, now 
on sale at cost at the Bookstore.
It is useful not only for stu­
dents who are in academic dif­
ficulty or recognize that they 
study inefficiently, but also for 
any student who wishes to or­
ganize his work or to learn some­
thing about the various techni­
ques that save time and needless 
effort. Some problems of study 
require individualized considera­
tion, and the Bureau is ready to 
see anyone who cares to make 
an appointment at the Bureau of­
fice, Room 245, Industries.
However, the manual is design­
ed to be used individually, since 
it gives a check list of study prin­
ciples on which a student rates 
himself and then consults the ap­
propriate sections of the manual 
dealing with his particular weak­
nesses. Thus it is not necessary to 
go through material which is not 
pertinent to the particular case.
A word of warning: “No one 
ever became a good student by 
reading a book about it. Reading 
does no good in itself; the prin­
ciples of efficient study must be 
applied and this means the stu­
dent must do some hard work.”
The various sections include 
basic study procedures, arranging 
the study environment, preparing 
a time budget, taking notes, read­
ing and using books, and prepar­
ing for and taking examinations.
Kappa Sigma
The C.I.T. chapter of Kappa 
Sigma, which became inactive 
early in 1944 when most of its 
members entered the Armed 
Forces, was reactivated on Mon­
day, April 1. At present, there 
are about ten active members on 
campus. By fall this number is 
expected to increase to thirty or 
thirty-five men when more Kappa 
Sigs return. There are several 
pledges, members of the last 
pledge class, who were not initi­
ated before the deactivation.
New officers were elected at the 
April meeting, which was held in 
the Phi Kappa house. Jim Rice, 
Bill Martin, and Don French are 
president, treasurer, and secretary 
respectively.
In June the chapter hopes to re­
open its house which has been oc­
cupied by the Pitt PiKA’s. Plans 
already in the making should re­
sult in the Kappa Sigs regaining 
their previous position in campus 
activities.
Tecvets Hear 
Major Canwright
Major Bruce W. Canwright, Air 
Corps, gave a review of the aims 
and plans of the Organized Re­
serve Corps in the Pittsburgh Dis­
trict to a group of veterans at the 
monthly business meeting of the 
“Tecvets” last Friday at 4:30 P. M.
After a brief review and dis­
cussion of the plans for this Sat­
urday night’s all-school dance, the 
“Tecvet Easter Parade,” Colonel 
Dowling, R. O. T. C. command­
ant here, introduced Major Can­
wright with a brief resume of his 
military service.
It is the President’s desire, Ma­
jor Canwright stated, that the
100,000 discharged enlisted men 
and the 8000 former officers of the 
Pittsburgh District become mem­
bers of the Organized Reserve 
Corps. This Corps will be estab­
lished in all sections of the coun­
try for the constant vigilance and 
preparation necessary to preserve 
our liberty. Members of this Corps 
will continue to acquire the same 
longevity benefits and promotions 
to which they would be entitled if 
on active duty.
The program being prepared 
with the help of the Reserve Of­
ficers Association will be both 
military and social. The military 
plans call for enlarging the re­
serves into a body larger than the 
standing army if possible, which 
will be organized into units which 
actually train together for short 
periods in the summer. The flaws 
in the old Organized Reserve such 
as *over-age men being listed as 
active members are to be elimin­
ated.
Flying Officers are to be given 
the opportunity to maintain their 
flying status. Through the year, 
planes will be made available to 
them for this purpose.
The offices of the Organized Re­
serve Corps are at the Commerce 
Building, Room 402.
Sigma Kappas Sponsor 
Fashion For Sororities
Miss Lenore Brundige spoke at 
a meeting in the Union last Wed­
nesday at 8:30 P. M. about fashions 
for this spring. Sigma Kappa in­
vited the other sororities on cam­
pus and members of the Costume 
Economics department to be their 
guests for this affair. A coffee hour 
followed Miss Brundige’s talk.
The speaker is a Sigma Kappa 
alumna from Denver University 
and a feature writer for the Pitts­
burgh Press. At present she is 
writing several fashion columns 
for that paper and keeps up to 
date on the latest styles by making 
frequent trips to New York and 
Chicago. An interesting evening was had by all who attended.
Sigma Nu
Another social fraternity that 
was forced to close its doors during 
the war because of too many 
“Greetings from the President” has 
appeared back on campus. The 
Delta Sigma chapter of Sigma Nu, 
national college fraternity, was 
reactivated a few weeks ago by 
several members now back at 
Tech. Aided by an active Alumni 
Association, the local group plans 
a rapid comeback to its former 
size and position among similar 
organizations enjoyed prior to 
1943, when it was disbanded. Al­
though handicapped by lack of a 
house at present, an ambitious so­
cial program is already being 
planned by Louis Knaak, Social 
Chairman and Treasurer of the 
chapter. It is expected that by the 
Fall semester the Sigma Nus will 
be comfortably situated in new 
quarters.
Sigma Nu is the fifth largest fra­
ternity of its kind in the country, 
boasting a total of ninety-nine 
chapters. The CIT chapter was 
the second fraternity to be repre­
sented on campus, being preceded 
only by the local chapter of Theta 
Xi. It numbers among its mem­
bers band leaders Kay Kyser and 
Johnny Long.
The reorganized chapter’s other 
officers are: President, Winky
Skelton; Vice-President, Edward 
A. Johnson; and Secretary, James 
Scarlett. Pledges are Jim Oschel- 
ager, Gordon Holmes, Keith 
Thomas, and Emory Thurston.
John H. Seipel, Chairman of the 
Sweepstakes Committee, an­
nounces that the preliminary race 
in the Sweepstakes and Design 
Competitions of the 1946 Spring 
Carnival will be run Saturday, 
April 27, at 10:30 A. M. The finals 
will be run May 4 at 2:00 The De­

take place immediately before the 
finals on Saturday. Pushmobiles 
and their drivers must be on hand 
for weighing in at 9:45 A. M. on 
both days, whether running in the 
finals or not. Any questions about 
the races should be referred to the 
Chairman of the Committee be­
fore the events, and the decision 
of the judges will be final. The 
rules governing the Sweepstakes 
and Design Competitions are as 
follows:
1. All men who have letters in

THE WORLD'S MOST
Alpha Tau Omega
Alpha Tau Omega, one of the 
national social fraternities that ex­
isted on the Tech campus years 
ago, is on its way back. The 
ATO’s under their president, Jack 
Reese, are reorganizing, and they 
expect to have back their own 
house by June. The house is on 
the corner of Morewood Ave. and 
Forbes St. and is now being occu­
pied by the Beta Sigs, who expect 
to get a new house next semester.
The active members on campus 
got together recently and made 
plans for this reformation. There 
are seven actives on campus, and 
as a part of their reactivation pro­
gram, they pledged seven new 
boys: Jay Atman, Lou Frances-
china, John Helmick, Norm Lar­
son, Jack Morley, Scott Somers, 
and Len Zogrin. A smoker was 
recently held at the Webster Hall 
Hotel to honor these pledges.
Scotch and Soda 
Needs Bottle Caps
Word comes from Danny 
Franks that this year’s Scotch 
and Soda production has been 
named Take It From Here. All 
plans are progressing smoothly. 
However, there is an urgent need 
for milk bottle caps and it will be 
greatly appreciated if all students 
will please cooperate by throw­
ing their milk bottle caps into the 
containers provided at Skibo.

Olsen Plays ''Music of Tomorrow
George Olsen will bring his na­
tionally known “Music of Tomor­
row” to the Saturday evening 
semi-formal of Spring Carnival.
Noted for distinctive dance and 
entertainment music, Olsen and 
his orchestra have recently de­
veloped a variety of skits which 
are making floor show history be­
fore leading cafe, hotel, and the­
ater audiences throughout the na­
tion. Judith Blair, cute songstress 
pictured on the front page, is one 
of the reasons why Olsen’s music 
is scoring new successes and is in 
constant demand. She is not only 
one of the outstanding popular 
singers of today, but is also a high 
ranking pin-up girl in many 
branches of the Armed forces. 
Ray Adams holds up the male 
side of the vocalizing.
When still a boy in Portland, 
Oregon, George displayed a strong 
inclination toward music. Al­
though his father bought him both 
a violin and a piano, he wasn’t 
satisfied until he saved his own 
money to buy a set of drums, to 
the consternation of the entire 
neighborhood.
What with starring in athletics, 
acting as cheer-leader, leading the 
band at all school functions, and 
fronting frequent parades, George 
was a busy boy. Not so busy, 
though, that he didn’t have time 
to organize a dance band which 
played for local parties.
He continued his musical bent
at the University of Michigan, 
where he managed and led one of 
the foremost campus orchestras. 
As soon as he was graduated, he 
returned to Portland, and set 
about the music business in earn­
est. While playing a one-nighter 
in California, he was heard by the 
late Ziegfield who recognized his 
ability and brought him to New 
York where he started big-time 
by playing in many Broadway 
shows.
“Sweet,” “swingy,” or “solid” 
can describe Olsen’s music, since 
his arrangements of both old and 
new favorites are as varied as 
their titles. Recognizing that audi­
ences want good entertainment in 
addition to dance music, Olsen’s 
band offers comedy spots through­
out the evening which brings loud 
demands for encores.
Following his “discovery” when 
he was fresh out of college, he and 
his band supplied the music for 
such hits as Kid Boots and 
Whoopee, both of which starred 
Eddie Cantor, Happy Days, Fol­
low Through, Good News, Sunny, 
and the Ziegfield Follies. Through­
out the years during which Olsen 
has remained in the nation’s band 
big-time, he has not only stayed 
abreast of the current taste, but 
has become well-known for in­
troducing new tunes. This, cou­
pled with his faculty for design­
ing new modes in music, has 
branded his orchestra with play­
ing “Music of Tomorrow.”

On Wednesday, April 10th, the

a bowling party. It will be held 
•between 7:30 and 9:00 at the Uni­

an “end of the year” one and a 
celebration. It seems that all but 
four girls in the dorm will gradu­
ate in May, so they certainly have 
something to celebrate.

Four Burps to the Breeze 
Department
Burp One is for the 8:30 driv­
ers who do not bother to park 
within the yellow lines at the Arts 
Building. Remember the 9:30 driv­
ers; they’re in a hurry too. Burp 
Two is for the few people who 
didn’t get a kick out of the April’s 
Fool edition of the Tartan. The 
End Man would like to make a 
correction, however. The Tartan 
falsely stated that the End Man 
weighs 97 pounds; he weighs 114 
and, it’s all his. Burp Three is for 
this “w r i t i n g-on-the-sidewalk” 
mania that has come over candi­
dates for various positions. The 
Cut is beginning to look like Grau- 
man’s Chinese. Burp Four is for 
the poor publicity given the lec­
ture of Virgil Thompson in the 
Little Theatre. Occasionally, there 
are good programs. Very occa­
sionally.
Four Shouts to the Wind 
Department
Shout One is for the hard work­
ing P & D’s who have been knock­
ing themselves out working on the 
murals for the Beaux Arts Ball. 
Shout Two is for the new English 
movie (reviewed in “Life” this 
week and down at the Schenley 
Theatre last week) called “Vaca­
tion From Marriage” with Robert 
Donat, Deborah Kerr (pronounced 
“Car”), and Ann Todd—all excel­
lent. Shout Three is for Isaac 
Stern, who gave a fine, well-bal­

the new books that are coming out 
in the twenty-five cent Pocket and 
Bantam editions. It’s about time.

Cornucopia Depariment 
We actually found a mistake in 
the New York Times. It was in 
the Music Section which reviewed 
a recital of a certain tenor who 
happened to sing two songs by 
Charles Tomlinson Griffes. The 
review said: “Mr. Griffes bowed 
from his box at the conclusion of 
the singing of his “Even Song” 
and “Lament of Ian the Proud.” 
Considering that Mr. Griffes died 
in 1920, that’s quite a trick. . . .

National Contest
Laurance B. Siegfried, Lowell 
Thomas, and Harold Van Doren 
will serve as judges of the 16th 
Annual Exhibition of Newspaper 
Typography to be held in Phila­
delphia on April 17, under the 
auspices of N. W. Ayer & Son, Inc.
Laurance B. Siegfried is Pro­
fessor of Graphic Arts and Head 
of the Department of Printing at 
Tech. For eleven years he was 
editor of The American Printer 
and in 1943 was awarded the Har­
ry J. Friedman Memorial Medal 
for “distinguished service in the 
cause of graphic arts education.” 
He is the author of “Typographic 
Design in Advertising” and nu­
merous articles in printing, pub­
lishing, and advertising publica­
tions. In 1934 he was one of the 
judges in this same contest.
Lowell Thomas is a radio news 
commentator, world-traveler, lec­
turer, newspaperman, and author 
of more than forty books. For the 
past eleven years he has been the 
voice of Movietone News, and his 
long and short wave broadcasts 
circle the world.
Harold Van Doren is considered 
by many to be the country’s fore­
most industrial designer.. He is 
the author of the first textbook on 
the subject, “Industrial Design— 
a Practical Guide,” and in 1940 
received the American Design 
Award.
More than one thousand English

Back up normal again after the 
little escapade to the Greeks with 
Zeke, Jelly Roll and the rest of 
the dice team last week—inci- 
dently, the African Golf experts 
racked up number two last night 
at the expense of a team of wait­
resses from Kahn’s (Leflanders). 
Enough!
Suggestion to the Pittsburgh 
Press: Get a Tech engineer with 
a slide rule to check your calcula­
tions. An article appeared two 
days ago about how well Jimmy 
Brown was doing for the Pirates. 
The headline had Brown hitting 
.600 of late and the sub-head said 
the wee one from St. Loo had 
swatted out 15 hits in his last 35 
trips to the plate. The article it­
self confirmed both of these state­
ments, so it probably wasn’t a 
mis-print. Even with a sad 
4.0x10-2 factor, I think they’ll 
find that 35 into 15 goes .428 
Then again, maybe they meant 
15 for 25. Any way you look at 
it, Herr Brown is doing all reet.
Almost—But—Not Quite
George Maley, “Father” of 
Tech’s would-be athletes, had a 
hair-raising experience with the 
old automogul Saturday night. 
George was whipping down Fifth 
Ave. at a speed too fast to men­
tion. Also there were the facts 
that he was in the middle of the 
road, a trolley coming in the op­
posite direction, and a hack try­
ing to pass on the right, Weeelll, 
George, with his usual presence 
of mind, came up with the re­
mark of the week. In this trying 
situation, and facing certain 
death, the unperturbed one ut­
ters, “Look, Mommy—No Hands!” 
(P. S. George is still alive). 
(P. P. S. His date died. She bail­
ed out).
From The Soap Box:
Campaign! What Tech needs is 
a school-wide Gripe Day! What 
with all the sentiment against this 
and that going around the cam­
pus, I think this would be a better 
place to reside if we had one 
whole day of nothing but griping 
and got it all off our chests. Class­
es would be held as usual, but if 
someone said something you 
didn’t like—tell him where to go. 
People would pay the same prices 
at the Skibo but they would let 
the management know how they 
felt about it. There’s enough 
throat-cutting going on in the 
world today 'behind people’s backs 
without adding Tech’s share to the 
confusion. What’s the sense of 
getting all wrought up about
Hours Due For 
W.A.A. Awards
Last week the Women’s Athlfetic 
Association started its mushball 
season, which will continue until 
the end of the semester. Practices 
are Wednesday at 3:30 and Friday 
at 4:30. If enough girls are inter­
ested, we will make up a team to 
play Pitt.
Last night the W.A.A. held an­
other of its all-school swimming 
parties. These parties, although 
never well attended, are always 
enjoyed by those who go. No ad­
mission was charged, and refresh­
ments were served.
This is the last chance to turn 
in hours for awards this year. A 
tabulated list of hours already 
earned should be given to Ruth 
Flanagan or any other member of 
the W.A.A. Board. Awards must 
be ordered now to be ready for 
the Awards Banquet on May 9th. 
Otherwise the numerals and sweat­
ers cannot be received until the 
beginning of next year. Remem­
ber 30 hours win numerals; a total 
of 90, a sweater; and a total of 
120, a letter. Hours can be accu­
mulated during four yearp; so 
hours from one year are still good 
the next year.
things and letting it stew in the 
mind a long time? It makes people 
bitter. Why not open the switch 
and let off all the steam at once? 
Who knows, maybe something 
constructive might come of it.
Here we go again! Don tells me 
things aren’t looking so bright for 
the sports page at this point. Bob 
Kindi tells us he’s still tired from 
that 440 he ran the other day. Bob 
had the lead all the way into the 
final turn and then, whoosh. May­
be it was too much grinding .over 
the books. That’s O. K., Bob, we’re 
only kiddin’.
Don’t lose a bit of it, Casey, not 
a pound!
The bowling tournament has 
finally been decided. The finals 
saw1 Scobell, Beta Sigs, the Delts, 
and the SAE’s in the all-determin­
ing match play. Scobell Hall was 
declared victors after a hair-rais­
ing experience. The match came 
down to* the wire, with Scobell 
needing twenty-two pins to win. 
Bill Skelton stepped up to the line, 
the last man between Scobell and 
defeat, and proceeded to strike out. 
Results of the tournament show­
ed Scobell Hall leading by nine 
pins, in the total win column.

Tech will definitely have a golf

has announced that all candidates 
for the Varsity golf team should 
report to the Athletic Office on 
Wednesday, April 10, at 4:30 P. M.

the highly touted Phi Kaps 6-3 to 
put the Delts in front of the 
league. However, the Phi Kaps in 
turn beat the Delts 6-3, while the
S. K. B.’s romped over the Betas 
7-1. The Delt loss coupled with 
the S. K. B. win left the latter 
holding top honors. In a wild 
game played amongst a 51-mile 
gale, the Pi K A’s nosed out Tau 
Delts 2-1. The T. X.’s withdrew 
from the league after having won 
one game.
Track Team 
Warming Up
In a dual meet with Wilkinsburg 
High School, Carnegie Tech was 
nosed out to the tune of 1000 to 
10 Vz. The boys put up a good fight 
but proved a little weak in the 
track events. Several of the boys 
were observed throwing their cig­
arettes away at the 50 yard mark 
of the 100 yard dash and taking a 
swig from the rubbing alcohol 
bottle immediately after each 
event. Therefore it is evident that 
they were in the best shape pos­
sible. Such is life.
The truth of the matter is that 
Tech did drop a pre-season meet 
rather badly to the aforesaid 
school. The only events in which 
Tech was noticably superior were 
the field events. They were able 
to cop firsts in the high jump, pole 
vault and broad jump, seconds in 
the shot-put and, of all things, the 
440 (how did that sneak in). Scot­
ty Yurohison, Hal Frederick, 
Riehl, and Balfrey captured most 
of the Tech scoring honors.
The following day the Tartan 
thin-clad high jumpers entered in 
a high jumping carnival at the 
University of Pittsburgh. The 
events were rather muddled but it 
is rumored that Tech fared very 
well. Riehl was top man for 
Tech with a jump of 5’ 10” while 
Balfrey and Frederick were right 
behind him with jumps of 5’ 8”.

Elections were completed last 
Monday, April 1, for the Carnegie 
Technical Staff. The new staff 
will take charge of organizational 
activities during the summer and 
will take over all responsibility 
for publishing the Technical next 
fall. Several changes were made 
in the staff organization.
Franz New Ed.
Joseph P. Franz was elected 
Editor-in-Chief and Joel Bigel- 
man, Managing Editor. The Lay­
out and Art Staff will come under 
the direction of the Managing Ed­
itor. The members of this staff are 
Lee Rapp, Jerome Bell, and 
George Marck. Also under the 
Managing Editor will be the Fea­
tures Editor, Hubert Aaronson. 
The Features Staff is composed of 
several divisions, the first of 
which is a new department con­
sisting of Article Editors Robert 
Siegel, Albert Schindler, Fred 
Frank, and Eugene Green. The 
purpose of this department is to 
assist in writing articles for the 
magazine. They will aid students 
desiring to write a story in finding 
information on the subject, and 
will refer them to some member 
of the faculty from whom they 
may obtain assistance. Also if a 
student has an idea for a story 
and does not feel he can write 
well enough, he may contact one 
of the Article Editors who will 
help him in his writing. They will 
also see that no two students are 
writing articles on the same sub­
ject. The Exchange Editor, David 
Lide and the Book Review Editor, 
Donald Koenig will also come un­
der the direction of the Features 
Editor. Lastly under the Features 
Editor will come the Techsperts 
Editor Eli Friedman, who will al­
so head the Techsperts Editorial 
Board. David Wallace will act as 
liaison man for the Board, by ex­
amining the problems sent in and 
assigning them to members of the 
board for solution.
Slagle Business Manager
Arthur Slagle will act as Busi­
ness Manager. The Circulation 
Staff and the Advertising Staff 
will be under his direction. 
Thomas Farrahy will take over 
the duties of Advertising Mana­
ger. The Circulation Manager will 
be Alex Sherman and his staff 
will be comprised of Norm Zuer- 
ner, William Knoell, and Richard 
DePrima. Publicity will be han­
dled by Mary Jane Horridge.
Circulation Staff Reorganized
The Circulation Staff has re-or­
ganized the filing system, and has 
a much better system for keeping 
permanent records. They have al­
so set up a new program for ex­
panding the circulation, and have 
done considerable work in cor­
recting subscription difficulties. 
That is, a number of people who 
had subscriptions to the Technical 
had not received their copies of 
the magazine. The Staff hopes to 
straighten out all these problems 
in the near future. Students who 
have subscribed and who have 
not been receiving their copies 
can help out by sending their 
names and mailing addresses to 
the Circulation Manager.

How to starve a spring fever

Comes once again the indolence that follows the

This: Get the slickest Arrow Sports Shirt or Sport Knit you can find at your dealer’s. (That won’t be hard. Every one gets its share of fine Arrow looks and tailoring. Most of them are washable.)
The moment you’re in its trim lines, you’ll want to 
dash out for some golf, tennis, or you-name-it.
If not, you can always sit around in your Arrow and look like a retired champion.
PS. If your Arrow dealer hasn’t the one you want, try him again.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 9, 1946
fcne of thSOYSCritical Temperature
Handsome Harry Ransom, Feb­
ruary’s Scottie “cover boy,” is ,a 
sub senior in the department of 
architecture. There are six feet of 
Harry topped off with blue eyes 
and fuzzy brown hair (like a 
beaver). But don’t all start run­
ning, girls; his love life is amply 
taken care of by Frankie Creel- 
man.
Despite the fact that he has ad­
mittedly been sick at times, Harry 
claims that Clearwater, Florida, 
’ the place where he has spent most 
of his life, is the healthiest spot in 
the world. He also made some 
statements about its climate and 
temperature, but they wouldn’t be 
understandable to the average 
Pittsburgher.
It seems that Harry’s parents 
moved to Pittsburgh and surpris­
ingly enough Harry came along 
with them and entered Carnegie 
Tech. He says he not only likes 
architecture but loves it. In fact 
it is one of his life’s greater pas­
sions. Frankie is the other.
Harry is the president of Pi KA 
and a member of the Beaux Arts 
Honorary. He was on the Scottie 
staff.
One of his prime dislikes is a 
woman who talks a good game of 
architecture; the thing he would 
most like to see on campus is a 
men’s college shop. (At least the 
idea is original). Getting closer 
to home, Harry thinks that the 
architecture school should con­
struct and donate a building a year 
on the campus.
When we consider things which 
Harry likes, we could go on 
forever. For instance: frats, dry 
martinis, 8 to 1, the Windsor Bar, 
Florida, fish (brain food?), well- 
dressed men and women, in fact 
clothes in general, warm weather
Harry Ransom
(in common with most Tech stu­
dents), athletics (especially foot­
ball), and movies, though he 
doesn’t like the theaters in which 
they are shown (if that made sense 
it would be so much easier to un­
derstand).
His two favorite authors are 
Phillip Wylie and Lin Yutang.
After he has graduated and has 
served his two terms of appren­
ticeship, Harry would like to join 
another architect and an indus­
trial designer, whereupon the three 
of them could go to Florida and 
hang out a shingle.
Frankie says that he is a good 
dancer when he dances (just what 
do you do on your dates, my boy?). 
Harry is also a charter member of 
the “Thank God it’s Friday, my 
God it’s Monday” Club.

Metals Club Shown 
Steel-Making Movie
The newly reorganized Metals 
Club got started with a bang last 
Friday night, as they sponsored a 
technicolor movie on Bessemer 
Steel-making. An explanation of 
the picture and various aspects of 
the Bessemer Process was given 
by P. R. Loughrey, Superintend­
ent of Open Hearth and Bessemer 
Furnaces at Jones and Laughlin 
Steel Company.
Prior to the meeting the club 
held a short meeting with Presi­
dent Jay Meierdirks presiding 
During the course of the meeting, 
the club, which is an affiliate of 
the A.I.M.E., was welcomed by 
Vice Chairman Tiesen of the Pitts­
burgh chapter of the A.I.M.E.
Glee Clubs Combine
On Wednesday, April 24, at 8:15, 
the combined Women’s and Men’s 
Glee Club will present a concert 
in Exhibition Hall. All students 
are cordially invited and the tick­
ets, which are necessary for ad­
mittance, can be obtained in Miss 
Orr’s or the Arts School office.
The concert will feature sacred 
and secular music. There will be 
piano and tenor solo as well as 
a number by the women’s trio.
Like The Romantic Young Lady, 
which did not create a stir as the 
first production of the season, 
Dona Rosita, the Spinster is a 
Spanish play. There the resem­
blance ends, except for the fact 
that neither is especially interest­
ing. Why these particular plays 
were chosen is not quite clear to 
us, since there are many other 
Spanish plays which not only pre­
serve the atmosphere of the Span­
ish theatre, but are written in such 
a way as to be interesting to an 
American audience. The Romantic 
Young Lady, inconsequential a 
play as it is, had much more action 
and plot than Dona Rosita. The 
latter is more concerned with po­
etic imagery, symbolism, and love­
ly language which sounds rather 
too flowery in English. It is also 
concerned with character study, 
in which respect it has a distinct 
advantage over the other, whose 
characters are only two-dimen­
sional. The virtues of Dona Rosita 
include one really good acting 
part, several medium-sized ones, 
and one long speech in the third 
act which is worth sitting through 
the whole play to hear.
The story of the play is sum­
med up in its title, Dona Rosita, 
the Spinster, or The Language of 
the Flowers. The main title covers 
the external action, and the sub­
title is the clue to the symbolism. 
Like Zoe Akins’ The Old Maid, 
the play begins with the heroine 
as a young girl, who grows suc­
cessively older in the remaining 
two acts. In the beginning, Dona 
Rosita is a charming young girl 
engaged to a handsome cousin 
from America. The cousin is forc­
ed to leave Spain, but she is true 
to him, and lives a quiet life of 
waiting with only his letters for 
consolation. He, however, is less 
faithful, and after many years she 
learns that he has married some­
one else. She herself is too old 
now to marry and the end of the 
play leaves us to suppose that she 
lives out her futile, frustrated life 
alone, with no hope left to her. 
The part that flowers play is best 
left to the interpretation of each 
individual who sees the show.
The first act is quite slow; it 
outlines the situation, and intro­
duces the main characters, includ­
ing the Rosa Mutabilis, which is 
as much a character as any of the 
human personages. It also intro­
duces three mysterious sisters, 
who go up to the Alhambra at
night. As to why they do. this, 
what the significance of their ac­
tions is, or why we meet them at 
all, your guess is as good as ours. 
The second act is much livelier, 
containing several good comic 
scenes, and some more characters 
that we have not heard of before 
and do not meet again. The third 
act is slower than the first,, has a 
few more new characters, and the 
wonderful speech we mentioned 
above, which is really the redeem­
ing feature of the play.
Of the actors, the only really 
good performance was given by 
Marilyn Bloom in the title role. 
She was not impressive in the 
first act, but later on did a truly 
excellent job. Her delivery of the 
long speech describing the inner 
life of a frustrated old maid was 
beautiful; she held the audience’s 
attention all the way throúgh this 
exceptionally long monologue. We 
were rather disappointed in Mary 
Laura Wood’s Housekeeper; this 
part could be played so as to be 
the most memorable thing in the 
show, but not only did she not 
play it that way, but she did not 
even make it an exceptional sup­
porting role. Just as the other ac­
tors except Miss Bloom in the sec­
ond and third acts, she seemed 
weighed down by the play and 
was unable to do her best. Most 
of the other actors had little to 
do, but Patricia Darragh put in an 
amusing bit in the style of Mar­
jorie Main, and Bert Pollock gave 
a sensitive characterization of a 
poor mistreated school teacher. 
On opening night all the actors 
seemed to be very nervous, for 
they spoke so rapidly that they 
were very difficult to understand. 
The worst offiender in this respect 
was Miss Wood, but she, like the 
others, slowed down by the mid­
dle of the first act.
The lighting, and especially the 
settings, were beautiful. They were 
done in what we might call a 
semi-realistic style which is ex­
actly the spirit of the play. The 
first asset with the greenhouse was 
particularly striking, as was the 
lighting effect which brought down 
the final curtain.
Tuition Raise
[continued from page 1]
modations and improved laboratory 
and classroom facilities, planned 
with a view to student welfare 
and the heightening of the educa­
tional advantages offered to stu­
dents, not only requires initial
expense but also results in in­
creased operational costs.
It has been found possible to 
avoid an increase in tuition in the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col­
lege because instructional costs 
per students are somewhat lower 
there than in the other Colleges. 
For a number of years there has 
been a difference between the to­
tal charges in this College and the 
total charges in the other Colleges.
Though Carnegie Tech hopes to 
meet the terms of the 1946 Endow­
ment Fund agreement and thus 
receive this year frofti the Car­
negie Corporation of New York 
eight million dollars to be added 
to the endowment, the rate of re­
turn on invested funds has fallen 
to such an extent that the income 
on the endowment of approxi­
mately $28,000,000 which Tech 
hopes to have after July 1, 1946, 
is almost exactly the same as the 
income which the institution was 
receiving in 1931 from the much 
smaller endowment of only $16,-
000,000. Thus the additional an­
nual income received from rfeceht 
gifts to the endowment and ex­
pected from the grant of the Car­
negie Corporation will merely 
compensate for the loss resulting 
from the steady decrease in inter­
est rates, and additional opera­
tional costs must be met by income 
from other sources.
The tuition increases at Tech 
comes at a time when other in­
stitutions have either increased 
their fees or are planning to do so 
in the near future. Indeed the in­
crease might have been somewhat 
greater had it not been for the 
earnest desire of the Trustees and 
administration to keep the total 
cost for tuition, books and sup­
plies within the amount allowed 
to veterans under the G. I. Bill. 
The new tuition charge in the Col­
lege of Engineering and Science 
and the College of Fine Arts will 
be $450 for a normal two-semester 
year, and since a veteran is allow­
ed a total of $500 for the same 
period, there will remain a mar­
gin of $25 per semester for books 
and supplies. A careful study has 
showed that this sum is adequate 
to cover the average costs per se­
mester, though in an occasional 
semester—particularly the first— 
the cost may exceed $25. The fac­
ulty has been urged to reduce re­
quirements of books and supplies 
in each course to a minimum in 
order that the average of $25 per 
semester be not exceeded.

Lectures on Music
On Thursday, April 4th, at 4:30, 
j Virgil Thomson delivered a lec­
ture titled “Words and Music” in 
the Little Theater. Mr. Thomson 
is a composer and. is music critic 
for the New York Herald-Tribune.
He and Ferzy Fitelberg were 
present to hear their compositions 
played at the International Soci­
ety for Contemporary Music Con­
cert which was held in Exhibi­

The newspaper of the Univer­

formation of a Flying Club. This 
type of club has 'become popular 
throughout the country with the 
influx of Air Corps veterans to 
the colleges, but this particular 
organization is distinguished by 
the low rates which it offers to 
its members. Three dollars an 
hour covers expenses for instruc­
tion in contrast to the eight to 
ten dollar fees usually charged 
at pilot training schools. Two of 
these three dollars go for operat­
ing expenses and the other goes 
to the instructor. So far, the club

“Frankie” is a General Studies 
senior, member of Delta Gamma, 
and 'Rushing Chairman of same. 
She’s spent ¡three-and-a-half long 
years here and will soon be ex­
posed to the turbulent world — 
she doesn’t like the idea either! 
As yet she doesn’t know what she 
will do after graduation. In her 
years at Tech she boasts of One 
A—the only one she ever expects. 
Shall I tell them? It’s from Mr. 
Risedorf. That’s an ad, son.
She doesn’t boast of a hobby 
but likes to sew and knit. Enjoys 
a good football game and thinks 
Tech ought to offer football schol­
arships to improve the “sore” sit­
uation abroad at the present time. 
Her pet peeve is formals—differ­
ent?—but she really hates them.
The favorite night of the week 
is Friday states our gal, Frankie. 
And the favorite date, and the 
favorite man is the one with light 
brown hair, blue eyes and a big 
nose who goes by the title of Mr. 
Harry Ransom. Incidentally H. R. 
was the other half of the Scottie 
cover—all due pardon for leaving 
you out of the first paragraph Mr. 
R. but you see you’re only part of

But every glamor gal with a 
pin man must have some “vic­
tual” specialty. In this case it’s 
roast beef rare with sparkling 
burgundy (yours truly will settle 
for the latter) . . . with music 
by Stan Kenton.
And her summers, oh yes the 
good old summer time—nothing 
like it—especially as it’s spent at 
Conneaut, Ohio, and the main ac­
tivity is painting motor boats. 
My nickel’s running out, so we 
must leave the girl who can smile, 
sew, and paint motor boats. The 
next coin is on you.
Blonde, Blue-eyed Karl Bryn 
Comes to Tech From Norway
Carnegie Tech’s newest addi­
tion to its growing League of Na­
tions, Karl Bryn, is well-known 
on campus even though he has 
only been here a few weeks. He 
has come all the way from Nor­
way to study Chemical Engineer­
ing at Tech having receiv­
ed a scholarship through the In­
stitute of International Education. 
Karl has already had two years 
at the University of Oslo, where 
he majored in Chemistry.
He is tall, very blonde, blue­
eyed and twenty-four years old; 
he likes women and is unattach­
ed! He speaks English quite well, 
having studied it in Norway, and 
also speaks French and German. 
He did not arrive on campus un­
noticed— two Tech women have 
already invited him to go out.
Karl likes America very well. 
He is amazed at the kindness the 
people over here have shown him. 
However, he finds going to school
FRAT FLASHES
Now that the month of April 
is well under way and spring is 
likewise, we’re all thinking about 
the Arts Ball, Easter vacation, and 
then Spring Carnival.
In the welcome back depart­
ment, we have the Kappa Sigs, 
the ATO’s and the Sigma Nu’s 
who have resumed their activities 
on campus.
At a tea given by the Sigma 
Kappa’s at the Union April 3, 
Lenore Brundige spoke on Spring 
Fashions. The other sororities on 
campus were the guests of the Sig­
ma Kappa’s.
Joan Ollett and Lois Brunn have 
been elected to represent the Tech 
chapter at the Sigma Kappa an­
nual National Convention which 
will be held August *5-8 at the 
Royal York Hotel at Toronto, Can­
ada. Friday, April 6, found the 
Sigma Kappa’s giving a formal 
dance in the Cardinal Room of the 
William Penn Hotel. Bob Kelly 
and his band provided the music. 
The Tech SAE’s, D. U.’s and the 
Theta Xi’s were also invited to at­
tend the dance.
The Beta’s attended a formal 
dance at the Chartiers Heights 
Country Club. They had Joey 
Simms and his band. The Beta’s 
gave the dance in conjunction with 
the Miami University Triad which 
is made up of the Phi Delts, the 
Sigma Chi’s and the Beta’s.
A picnic at South Park was the 
feature of last Sunday for the 
Beta’s, the Tau Delts, and the 
PiKA’s.
Wednesday evening the PiKA’s 
are having a dinner for the seven 
campus queen candidates.
Last Wednesday the Tri Delts 
attended a tea dance given for 
them by the Delts. ¿*
Friday afternoon the brave Tri 
Delts weathered the weather and 
traveled to South Park Commun­
ity Park for a picnic. *
In the South Park division, the 
A. E. Phi’s had a Juke Box dance 
at Totem Pole Lodge, Saturday, 
March 30. Estelle Mattes was 
chairman of the very successful 
affair. There were at least 80 peo­
ple in attendance.
The Ph* ’"'1edges gave a
in a foreign country difficult, for 
everything he studies must be 
translated into his own language 
before he can fully understand 
it. Taking a test is difficult, too, 
for he must translate the ques­
tions before he can answer them. 
This takes more time on a quiz 
than most people have to spare. 
He is not used to talking tests 
either, for in a Norwegian Uni­
versity the students do not take 
examinations until they are ready 
to graduate when they get com­
prehensive ones. In the Univer­
sity of Oslo, Karl says there are 
no fraternities or sororities. There 
is no campus; the buildings are 
spread around the city of Oslo. 
Now that the war is over, they 
intend to consolidate the campus 
outside Oslo'.
The Germans closed the Uni­
versity in 1943, and Karl went to 
work in a Research Institute. The 
Germans also took all the radios, 
so the Norwegians started an un­
derground newspaper, on which 
Karl worked.
The big Norwegian is disap­
pointed in Pittsburgh weather, for 
he brought his skis with him. 
Right at this moment When spring 
fever is creeping up on every­
body, we hope he keeps on being 
disappointed in the weather.
AIEE-IRE Hears 
Mr. Ralph Kirk
AIEE-IRE held its second 
smoker of the semester in the Car­
negie Union, March 27. The 
speaker of the evening was Mr. 
Ralph Kirk, (E ’14) Assistant to 
the Vice President of the Duquesne 
Light Company.
Prior to the officially scheduled 
meeting time, a great many of the 
electrical engineers met at Skibo 
to eat together informally. Fol­
lowing dinner, the members ad­
journed to the Union where the 
regular meeting began at 6:45 P. 
M.
The smoker began with the 
showing of a well-prepared Du­
quesne Light film titled “From Sun 
to Sun,” a movie which traced the 
conversion of energy through its 
various stages from coal-pile to 
home wall-plug. In addition it 
showed views of the various sub­
stations, illustrated the functions 
of various workers, and showed 
the effects of various electrical 
loads on the systems.
After the film Ed Thompson, 
electrical student, presented an en­
joyable piano concert of semi- 
classical and popular numbers.
Mr. Kirk then spoke on the 
things which an engineer must 
consider in his job in addition to 
the technical requirements. Fol­
lowing this talk refreshments were 
served, and the smoker ended in 
groups of informal discussions.
party for the actives Saturday, 
March 30. A few men from St. 
Francis College were the guests of 
the Phi Kappas this week. The 
boys are interested in seeing fra­
ternity life on the campus.
Theta Xi had an informal house 
dance Saturday, March 30.
The Tech Chi O’s sang at a 
Founder’s Day Luncheon which 
was held Saturday, April 7, at the 
Roosevelt Hotel. Both Pitt and 
Tech Chi’s and Pittsburgh alum­
nae attended.
The Delts had a house party 
Friday evening.
Thursday, the D. U.’s gave a din­
ner dance for the Theta’s from 
4:30 to 7:30.
At the Union on Sunday, March 
3, the Tech Thetas gave a tea for 
Pitt’s chapter.
Friday night the Tau Delts gave 
a party for the A. E. Phi’s. In the 
way of entertainment the boys did 
a take-off on A. E. Phi’s rushing. 
Bud Yorkin acted as M. C. They 
also had a mock radio program— 
Truth or Consequences.. In the 
way of refreshment, the Tau Delts 
served chop suey.
The SAE gave a Tea Dance for 
the D. G.’s on March 29 from 5 
to 8.
On Saturday, March 30, the D. 
G.’s had a slumber party at M. 
Gannon’s house.
Maggie Murph Senate 
Sponsors Skit Party
On Thursday, April 11, from 
7:30 to 10:00, the different classes 
and the faculty of Margaret Mor­
rison will present skits in the Rec­
reation Hall of MMCC. Both the 
classes and the faculty have been 
busy working on their pr9ductions.
A silver cup, now on display in 
the MMCC Library, will be award­
ed to the winning class for one 
year. The victors will have the 
year of graduation' of their class 
engraved upon it. The cup will be 
presented by Phoebe James.
Some members of the Margaret 
Morrison faculty will be judges, 
and refreshments will be served. 
The present senior class won last 
year.
Laboratory in a 
Birch Thicket
This thicket of birch trees is one of 
the Bell System’s scientific work­
shops.
Here our scientists have strung 
telephone wires through the crowded 
branches to learn just how much 
tree rubbing and abuse the protective 
coverings and insulation on new 
types of wire will stand.
Important? With more than fifteen 
million insulated "drop wires” con­
necting home and business telephones 
to nearby poles, we’ve got to be sure 
that the wire we use is the very best 
that can be produced.
This is but one small t>~ample of 
hundreds of experiments and research 
projects carried on constantly by Bell 
Laboratories to make Bell Telephone 
Service more dependable, more useful, 
to more people.

Look who they have polishing 
the old Eight Ball this week, none 
other than poor old Me. Who Me 
is? Well that isn’t important, but 
what Me intends to say is. Sounds 
kind of screwy but then I have 
to be or I wouldn’t be me. Well 
to get on to more important 
things, such as — since when did 
Dentists have 9:30 p. m. appoint­
ments f:r patients, or was it a 
Doctor’s appointment that intrig­
ued Dorothy Papa to rush in and 
out of the Plaid Office Friday 
night, but then a gal doesn't dress
- that nice for a Medico. Since 
¦when did three make a quartet or 
vice versa, but Pete, O’Donovan 
and Kelley insist that they only 
need three voices to make a 
quartet, but then I guess you can 
do most anything with higher 
mathematics. Those in the know 
claim that Kelley can do most 
anything. It certainly is grati­
fying to know at least one other 
student re? ^ *• the paper besides 
the Plaid F :il f r the kind con­
structive c sent in by an
annoyomou > fellow evening stu­
dent provp; that we at least have 
one reader, but then it’s easier to 
set back and criticize than to 
spend an hour or so on Friday 
evening and help fill the paper 
with more interesting articles 
than just things “to fill up the 
space,” stating once again, let’s 
not just crab: but come out and be 
a real sport and help. Incidently 
the group of Engineers that gather 
around that certain table at the 
Skibo certainly have plenty of 
hash to mash, or at least their ges­
tures seem to say so.
Surely they can’t be friends and 
still call each other names they 
do. How do I know that they’re 
calling each other mean things? 
Why, by reading their lips through 
binoculars of course. Now I’ve seen 
everything—Tech Evening School 
has gone Western (Hand me my 
shooten arns gals!). I just saw 
three of the BEELER GALS, Lee, 
Georgia, and Gravel Gerty Beeler 
entering Industries wearing blue 
jeans. Yee gads! Isn’t it tough 
enough to get trousers without 
gals muscling in. In case you’re 
interested the Plaid has moved 
its office again. This time they 
have a room that’s a shade bigger 
than it was, and much nicer, and 
Yep! We even have a phone, but 
then the Plaid Staff is much too 
busy to spend their precious few 
hours toying with the phone. Nev­
er thought Betty Ashcraft would 
turn selfish on us, but then it hap­
pened at the Skibo the other 
evening. Betty nodded very cas­
ually to poor me (as usually sit­
ting on the other side of the room) 
but then I guess I couldn’t blame 
her, for the boy sitting across from 
her was really a handsome fellow; 
now she tells me it was her broth­
er. Alphonse and Gaston, those 
two lovable bus boys otherwise 
known as Frank and Ches have 
again volunteered to do the ca­
tering for the dinner to be held 
in the Union this coming Satur­
day evening. Nice work boys! In­
stead of polishing the old Eight 
Ball I -find that all this dirt dust­
ing has made it appear more dusty 
so I’ll give the polishing up as a 
bad job and hope that all the regu­
lar Eight Ball duster shows up 
next week and returns the old 
shine to this jinx ball.
Remember how briskly you 
walked into the school on some 
cold, windy, wintry evening with 
the wind hitting your face and 
the snow blowing around you, 
seeming as it were to isolate you 
from the rest of the world? In 
your mind was a mixture of 
thoughts — none quite definite. 
Perhaps your mind had drifted to 
some distant sunny retreat for 
which you had neither the money 
nor the time; or perhaps you were 
worrying about that exam you 
were to take at 7:30 P. M., for 
which you had scarcely prepared. 
Or possibly the car was “acting 
up”—a bum battery, a shot con­
denser or coil, or a hundred 
kindred ills that always beset 
your car. Yes, what a terrible way 
to have to live. Work, school, 
snow, chains, tires, exams, etc., 
etc., ad infinitum—gripe, grippe, 
grippe. Oh, why do we have to 
have winter anyway!
But eventually there comes a 
time, just about this time of the 
year, that something happens to 
most normal people—even Tech 
evening students. Perhaps it is the 
sweet breath of spring whispering 
through the budding trees and 
bushes, heralding the advent of 
another spring. Or perhaps it may 
be the incessant chirping and 
chattering of our feathery friends

outside as they flit about, prepar­
ing another home. And it might 
even be just the knowledge that 
spring is really here—here at last 
after that long dreary winter of 
goodness knows how long.
At any rate, a feeling of con­
tentment and joy overcomes us, 
and, try otherwise as we may, we 
are pleased and satisfied with the 
induced lassitude of the spring 
season. How wonderful to loaf 
around and shirk our immediate 
responsibilities. Not a care in the 
world. Hanana, manana. Tomor­
row will take care of itself. Why 
worry? We had this day of rest 
coming to us for a long time; and 
so let’s enjoy it—every little bit 
of it. There is plenty of time to do 
the work outlined for us. Let’s not 
be rushed now; we need time to 
think over and to dream over 
those million and one things that 
we should be doing. We can easily 
take care of that tomorrow. Why 
worry? Uh huh . . . Oh yeah . . . 
sure . . . sure . . . zzzzz . . .
And suddenly through the web 
of dreams and fantasies comes 
that clarion call to arms. “Here, 
Bill. First, wash down the bath­
room walls and then the kitchen 
walls. After that we must clean 
the wallpaper; and you can help 
me stretch the curtains, etc., etc.”
Oh, hell, who invented spring

Mary DcMaria 
Treas. of Eve. 
Student Council
If you happen to see an attrac­
tive brunette lingering over a de­
lectable dish of strawberry short­
cake, chances are she’ll be Mary 
De Maria, Treasurer of Evening 
Student Council. Brown hair and 
eyes to match, with a slim figure 
of 5-2 are Mary’s to claim. Her 
quiet and congenial manner are 
assets to a pleasing personality, so 
if you don’t already know her, 
drop in the PLAID office any Fri­
day evening and make her ac­
quaintance.
Having been a student in Tech’s 
Evening School for only 3 years, 
Mary has set an enviable record 
for herself. Last year she acted as 
News Editor of the PLAID, and 
Secretary to Evening Student 
Council. She has earned 3 In­
signia Awards, which proves she 
started right in on extra-curric- 
ular activities in her first year. 
In this time she also has become 
a member of Pi Delta Epsilon. 
Your reporter noticed a Tech 
class ring on Mary's right hand 
and found she graduated from the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col­
lege in the December class of 
1942, walking away with a B. S. 
Degree in Secretarial Studies.
Studying music is Mary’s chief 
concern here in Evening School 
this semester. Being an efficient 
secretary in the Veterans Center 
keeps her busy through the day, 
while bridge, tennis, and listen­
ing to concert music occupy her 
spare time. Incidentally, she 
amusingly relates, she has a pas­
sion for Tommy Dorsey and 
Frankie Carle’s renditions. Mary 
also delights in reading poetry by 
Ogden Nash, stories by Saroyan, 
and cartoons by Virgil Partch and 
George Price. Shopping in town 
is her chief dislike, and we don’t 
blame you, Mary.
Residing at the Bellefield 
Dwellings is very pleasant indeed, 
but Mary really hails from Salts- 
burg, Pa., which is about thirty 
miles from here. Living so close to 
the campus certainly must elim­
inate transportation difficulties 
for her.
Movies play a big part in 
Mary’s private life, for she loves 
them. “Lost Weekend” was one of 
her favorites. By the way, be­
fore I forget to mention it, Mary 
simply dotes on shrimp cocktail 
and olives.
In conclusion, may I say, “Keep 
up the good work, Mary, and 
thank you for a wonderful inter­
view.” We need more workers 
like Mary and hope her stirring 
example will inspire new Evening 
Students to strive for higher goals 
and reap results as bounteously as 
Mary De Maria.

Tuition Change
Because of greatly increased 
costs of operation, Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology has found it 
necessary to increase tuition rates 
in certain categories of the Even­
ing classes. The charge for Even­
ing Courses offered by the de­
partments of the College of En- 
pineering and Science and the 
College of Fine Arts will be in­
creased to $4.20 per unit. Evening 
courses offered by the depart­
ments of Margaret Morrison Car­
negie College for Women and the- 
Division of Humanistic and So­
cial Studies will remain at $3.60 
per unit. The general fee has been 
eliminated for students in Evening 
classes. These increases in tuition 
will be effective at the beginning 
of the Fall Semester.
It Happened Then!
The following article was clip­
ped from a newspaper dated Feb­
ruary 28, 1912:
“It is likely that the name of the 
Carnegie Technical schools will be 
changed to that of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. Samuel 
Harden Church, of the board of 
trustees left last night for New 
York, where it is believed he has 
gone to confer with Andrew Car­
negie, the donor of the schools, 
with reference to obtaining his ap­
proval of the proposed change of 
name. Before leaving Pittsburgh, 
Mr. Church said that the matter of 
drawing up the papers to present 
to court authorizing the change is 
in the hands of George E. Shaw. 
The petition probably will be pre­
sented to the court within a 
week.”
Exchanges
[continued from page 7] 
informs the students that they can 
enter all types of sports, competi­
tive or otherwise, publications, 
dramatics, radio, political clubs or 
anything else of interest to them. 
Of course the heavy academic 
program keeps everyone well oc­
cupied, but it isn’t the Univer­
sity’s fault that these recreation­
al facities are not utilized to the 
utmost!
The Daily Texan is taking up 
the cudgels again. This time its 
for the veteran who tried to get 
some of that shiny new surplus 
property and has • only a fistful 
of priority tickets to show for his 
efforts so far. Bulldozers, jeeps, 
trucks, and similar items which 
would be of assistance in setting 
up or expanding a veteran’s bus­
iness are either being returned to 
the wholesalers—or being sold in 
Mexico! Certain minor items are 
being disposed of to the exserv­
icemen as palliatives — cameras 
with focal lengths greater than 
3.5, for example, and defective 
underwear. This column doesn’t 
see what the Daily Texan is bit­
ter about. Shirts, watches, heavy 
flying clothes, and jeeps, lie 
smashed and torn by army ham­
mers and bulldozers all over the 
world At least these items are re­
turned home so that the manu­
facturer can make a second profit 
on them.
Ration of inflation from the 
Silver and Gold of the University 
of Colorado: There are 300 billion 
spendable dollars available for the 
next year, and there will be but 
101 billion dollars worth of goods 
to satiate this demand. The
O. P. A. is pushing hard to keep 
the inevitable price rises down, 
but pressure from some organiza­
tions. such as the NAM to break 
the controls is terrific. When sev­
eral members of the faculty were 
interviewed on this subject, all 
agreed that Chester Bowles’ or­
ganization should be allowed to 
continue. The University purchas­
ing agent sounded a dissenting 
note in. the cause of increased 
production.
