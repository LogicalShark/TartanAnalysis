Introduces
Activities
This Saturday morning the 
leading extracurricular campus 
organizations will have represen­
tatives in Skibo Ballroom from 
9:30 to 11:30. They will be ready 
to give out information about their 
group’s activities. Their presen­
tations will be done in an enter­
taining as well as informative 
program. All freshman and other 
new students" should be there. The 
Activities Fair is an excellent 
chance for new students to make 
initial decisions about groups in 
which they hope to hold member­
ship.

The Council of Frater­
nity Presidents cordially 
invites the general campus 
to an after-the-game mixer 
in the Skibo Ballroom on

Hunt Enfoi 
Students
The Hunt Library, now in its 
second year of operation, is a 
source of pride for all Tech stu­
dents, not only because of its spa­
cious, modern accommodations, 
but also because of the efficient, 
convenient “open-stack” system of 
distributing boks. Although the 
many varied services of the li­
brary will be explained in later 
issues of the Tartan, briefly, the 
“open-stack” system eliminates 
unnecessary, time-consuming steps 
by allowing the student to remove 
books for use in the library proper 
without the need of a librarian’s 
assistance and without having to 
sign for the books. Unfortunately 
many students abuse these priv­
ileges by removing books from the 
library without signing for them 
and by mutilating books used in 
the library. Since th library is 
for the benefit of all students, Stu­
dent Congress and the adminis­
tration have ruled that any indi­
viduals found guilty of stealing or 
mutilating books shall be subject 
to severe disciplinary action up to 
and including expulsion. It is the 
hope of the above groups as well

for Freshmen to meet their classmates, enables new students 
to become acquainted with faculty members and upperclass 
leaders in a relaxed atmosphere. The program includes ex- *____________________________________

Over the summer there have 
been many changes in the faculty 
at Tech, The following were pro­
moted to the rank of professor, 
Simeon Friedberg, professor of 
physics; Harold Paxton, profes­
sor of metallurgical engineering; 
John Pekruhun, professor of 
architecture; and James March, 
professor of industrial adminis­

perience of college life as well 
as . athletic and social events.
This year’s Freshman Camp 
was under the leadership of 
chairman Tom Ference, a senior 
mechanical engineer, and asso­
ciate chairman Jane Scott, a sen­
ior chemist. Adding greatly to 
the success of Camp were the ef­
forts of several campus person­
alities who attended Camp as 
guests of the staff. They included 
Prof. Robert Schmertz, Depart­
ment of Architecture, Miss June 
Helmers, Department of Drama, 
the cheerleaders and pipers, and 
the competent work of the 
members of the WRCT mobile 
unit. As with any camp, however, 
the true measure of success in 
determined by the efforts of the 
counselors and certainly this 
year’s group richly deserves all 
the praise that they have re­
ceived. A survey of campus opin­
ion has failed to determine who 
enjoyed Camp more, the fresh­
men or the staff, but the con­
sensus is that this was the best 
Freshman Camp ever!
Those promoted to the rank of 
associte professor are Angel Jor­
don, asicosate professor of elec­
trical engineering; Roberdt Schu­
macher, associate professor of 
physics; Beekman Cottrell, asso­
ciate professor of English; Alfred 
Kuehn, associate professor of eco­
nomics and industrial administra­
tion; David Day, associate protes­
tor of social studies; and Hor- 
tense Pearson, associate professor 
of business studies.
The new assistant professors 
are Hames Dreesen, assistant of 
physics; Seymour Mandelbaum, 
assistant professor of history; and 
Robert Ramsey, assistant profes­
sor of psychology and education.
James Rosenberg has been en­
gaged as a professor of drama. 
Seven men have been employed 
as associate professors. They are

ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR
With today’s entry I begin my ninth year of writing columns 
in your school newspaper for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes.
Nine years, I believe you will agree, is a long time. In fact, 
it took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez 
Canal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was! 
To be sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the 
shovel been invented at that time, but, as we all know, the 
shovel was not invented until 1946 by Walter R. Shovel of 
Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel’s discovery in 1946, all 
digging was done with sugar tongs—a method unquestionably 
dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu­
rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr. Shovel's 
breakthrough—notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal 
Thomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only 
thing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This 
so depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy 
from which he did not emerge until two years later when his 
friend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered 
him up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.
But I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this 
column for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine 
years they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You 
think that anyone who has tasted Marlboro’s unparalleled 
flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro’s filter, who has revelled in 
Marlboro’s jolly red and white pack or box should be more than 
willing to write about Marlboro without a penny’s compensa­
tion. You are wrong.
Compensation is the very foundation stone of the American 
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system 
absolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I 
have a friend named Rex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession, 
who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up 
and say, “Hey, Rex, let’s go bowl a few lines,” or “Hey, Rex, 
let’s go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,” and he 
will always reply, “No, thanks. I better stay here in case 
somebody wants a dog wormed." I mean there is not one thing 
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than 
worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm­
ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other­
wise would be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of 
democracy.

It's the same with me and Marlboro Cigarettes. I think 
Marlboro’s flavor represents the pinnacle of the tobacconist'» 
art. I think Marlboro’s filter represents the pinnacle of the 
filter-maker’s art. I think Marlboro’s pack and box represent 
the pinnacle of the packager’s art. I think Marlboro is a pleas­
ure and a treasure, and I fairly burst with pride that I have 
been chosen to speak for Marlboro on your campus. All the 
same, I want my money every week. And the makers of 
Marlboro understand this full well. They don’t like it, but they 
understand it.
In the columns which follow this opening installment, I will 
turn the hot white light of truth on the pressing problems of 
campus life—the many and varied dilemmas which beset the 
undergraduate—burning questions like “Should Chaucer class­
rooms be converted to parking garages?” and “Should proctors 
be given a saliva test?” and “Should foreign exchange students 
be held for ransom?”
And in these columns, while grappling with the crises that 
vex campus America, I will make occasional brief mention of 
Marlboro Cigarettes. If I do not, the makers will not give me 
any money. o if»« Max shuim**

The New Outlook
Every Tech student ought to at some 
time in his four years here participate in 
Freshmen Camp. In fact, Freshmen Camp 
ought to be a requirement for graduation. 
Classes have begun now and most of us are 
settling down to the rhythm of campus life, 
but those of us who were at Camp see Tech 
in a different light. Freshmen Camp and the 
school spirit generated there are still very 
much alive in both the freshmen and the 
counselors. Everyone who attended is a 
richer person because of it.
The freshmen are traditionally pictured 
as wide-eyed and bubbling with questions. 
True, many questions need to be answered 
before settling down is possible and the rest 
of the campus community will be sought to 
provide this guidance. But the freshmen
lack only superficial knowledge of the cam­
pus, details, otherwise they would be indis­
tinguishable from the rest of us. These details 
are easily learned. Rather it is the campus 
community that should be concerned with 
what it may learn from the freshmen. How 
can their enthusiasm become part of the 
campus atmosphere?
The longevity of the Chinese culture has 
been attributed to the fact that the Chinese 
people have always been able to complete­
ly absorb their invaders. Let this be one 
year that the indifferent do not absorb the 
enthusiastic on the Tech campus. Just for 
once the rest of the campus might remain 
silent and let someone with a new outlook 
set the tone.

Administrative Document Expresses 
Views on Fraternity Life
This past spring the Execu­
tive Board of Carnegie Institute 
©f Technology presented to the 
entire fraternity system a docu­
ment entitled “Fraternity Pol­
icy.” It outlined the school’s view 
of fraternity life. Excerpts from 
this policy statement follow:
“Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology believes now, as it has 
for many years, that a strong, 
dedicated and self-disciplined 
fraternity system can and will 
make a significant contribution 
to the achievement of the 
school’s objectives which are 
stated in the catalogs, to the life 
of the campus community, and 
to the personal development of 
individual students. The exist­
ence of fi'aternities on the cam­
pus is based upon this belief. 
The institution stands ready, as 
it always has, to encourage sup­
port and assist a fraternity sys­
tem that fulfills its responsibili­
ties to CIT, to the acadamic 
community, and to the student 
members. These responsibilities 
have been admirably defined in 
the Decalog of Fraternity Policy 
adopted by the Interfraternity 
Conference — which is here re­
produced.
1.The college fraternity has its 
goal, in harmony with that of 
the college, to provide train­
ing and discipline of the in­
dividual who, in seeking an 
education, desires to make of 
himself a useful member of 
society, possessing knowledge, 
trained skill, and capacity for 
accomplishments. It carries 
forward the fundamental 
purposes of education, adding 
a fraternal influence for cor­
rect living and individual de­
velopment.
2. The college fraternity must 
regard itself as an integral 
part of the institution in 
which it is located. It not only 
must be amendable to the 
rules and regulations of the 
college institution, but must 
share in all the college re­
sponsibilities of the under­
graduate.
3. The college fraternity is also 
a business organization. Suc­
cessful management requires 
sound financial practices and 
good housekeeping methods, 
There is the dual obligation 
of prompt payments of ac­
counts due. The fraternity 
man and the chapter group 
acquire strength and stature 
as they develop business ex­
perience and a true percep­
tion of correct business meth­
ods.
4. The college fraternity stands 
for excellence in scholarship. 
It seeks, as a part of its col­
lege, to promote diligent ap­
plication to study by the fra­
ternity member, not only in 
order that the requirements 
of the college be met, but also 
that achievement above the 
average level may be attain­
ed.
5. The college fraternity accepts 
its role in the moral and 
spiritual development of the 
individual. It not only ac­
cepts the standards of the 
college, but, in addition en­
deavors to develop those finer 
qualities of ethical conduct 
which add to the inner 
growth of men.
6. The college fraternity re­
cognizes that culture goes 
hand in hand with education, 
and therefore, seeks to broad­
en the growth of the frater­
nity member by encouraging 
the acquisition of knowledge 
and training in cultural sub­
jects.
7. The college fraternity is the 
center of much of the social 
life of the fraternity member. 
As such it seeks to develop 
the social graces, the art of 
good living, the development 
of courtesy and kindness. 
Good manners, good taste, 
and good companionship are 
a part of the training of ev­
ery fraternity member.
8. The college fraternity re­
cognizes the importance of 
the physical well-being of its 
members. It seeks to provide 
healthful and sanitary hous­
ing. It encourages healthful 
practices by its members, dis­
courages physical excesses 
and promotes atheltic com­
petition in both fraternity 
and college life, so that mens 
sana in corpore sana shall be 
the aim of every fraternity 
member.
10. The college fraternity seeks 
to develop those qualities of 
human understanding, of 
companionship, of kindness, 
with a knowledge and train­
ing an appraising the basic 
values of life, which will lead 
towards a better civilization, 
with peace and understanding 
among all peoples.
The administration can add
nothing to this statement, for it
defines precisely the kind of 
fraternity system that Carnegie 
Tech wishes to support. The true 
fraternity recognizes that its 
members are, first of all, stu­
dents and that their reason for 
being on the campus is to profit 
from the educational opportu­
nities afforded them. Accepting 
this, the fraternity should place 
the educational progress of its 
program accordingly. It should 
constantly encourage success in 
the classroom, create an environ­
ment that is conducive to serious 
study, and reward and honor 
academic achievement. This does 
not mean that the fraternity 
house should become merely a 
private study hall. The funda­
mental purpose of the fraternity 
is social, but its interest must 
be, not in producing social lions 
who have been to college, but in 
helping young men become edu­
cated as well as develop social 
skills and poise.
Moreover, a soundly oriented 
fraternity recognizes that its 
unique contribution is rooted in 
the opportunity it affords men 
who are committed to a com­
mon ethical ideal of conduct, 
service, and loyalty to live, work 
and play together; in its ability 
to develop social grace, and per­
sonal and group responsibility; 
and in the opportunities it pro­
vides its members to practice 
the art and science of construc­
tive leadership.”
The ideals set down in the 
decalog of Fraternity Policy of 
the National Interfraternity Con­
ference are the ideals to which 
the fraternity system at Carnegie 
Tech is aspiring.

A Candle in the Darkness
by Jeffery Axelrad
I Pledge Allegiance
The popular feeling of responsibility toward govern­
ment was expressed by President Kennedy in his inaugural 
address — “and so, my fellow Americans, Ask not what your 
country can do for you—ask what you can do for your 
country.’ This is what the “good” citizen is expected to do 
today.
Yet, in the beginning, governments were formed by the 
consent of the peoples governed. Each individual person 
made a choice of either joining and being governed by the 
first government or moving out into the wilderness. The 
most logical reason for joining such a government (or being 
a citizen of such a country) would be that each individual 
felt that the government would do more for him than he 
could do for himself alone. Today a person has no such 
choice. What I am suggesting however, is that governments 
be examined on the basis that the government which does 
the most for its subjects with the least interference with 
each individual’s daily life would be considered the best 
government. This may sound innocuous enough, but carry­
ing this principle to its logical conclusion, a government has 
no right to make any laws restricting a person’s freedom, un­
less this freedom is used to harm other subjects of the gov­
ernment. Thus, such a government would have no right to 
make laws restricting a person’s right to buy narcotics, 
gamble, or, for that matter, become a prostitute.
And, in fact, the modern government has become a 
tyranny of the majority. Every government assumes the 
right of dictating its subjects morals. For example, marriage 
is today considered by nearly all countries the lawful way 
for man and woman to live together, and the majority view 
is forced on others by calling any couple which lives to­
gether for a set time married “in law” whether the two 
people concerned wish to take on the responsibilities of 
marriage or not. I, as an individual, feel that I am capable— 
and even if not capable, have the right—to decide for my­
self whether I wish to abide by the majority’s ethical stand­
ards. Any government which will not allow me to do so is 
infringing upon my rights as a human capable of reasoning.
Certainly a government must infringe upon the rights 
of its citizens for the good of all. A government may re­
strict unscrupulous business practices or build highways for 
the good of the majority even if this displeases a minority. 
Only when a law will restrict people without materially fur­
thering the common good is the law unreasonable. A person 
has the right to attempt to take his own life—but there are 
laws against even this.
I. suggest as a criteria for judging governments: Ask not 
what you can do for your country—ask wThat your country 
can do for you. The United States comes out well using this 
measure, perhaps best in the world, but it has a long way to 
go before it can truly be called a good and fair government.

Candidates are still needed for

desperately needed. There ar6 
now 28 men practicing under the 
tutelage of Head Coach Eddie 
Hirshberger. In an interview, 
Coach Coach Hirshberger de­
clared, “It’s tough to play modem 
college football with only 28 men 
out for the team. You just don’t 
have enough men to rest one 
squad while you correct the mis­
takes of another. If we could just‘d 
get one more team from the stu­
dent body now, we could improve 
ourselves a great deal. All we 
need is just one team.
Men interested in playing foot­
ball need to have had no previous 
high school experience. Coach 
Hirshberger emphasized the fact 
that several of Tech’s best players 
had no experience before coming 
here.
Those interested in trying out 
for the team are urged to speak 
with Coach Hirshberger in his of­
fice beneath Donner Hall some­
time after 4:00 in the afternoon.
Is it possible that only 28 out of 
a male student population of near 
2500 have the initiative to go outs' 
for football? Wouldn’t you like to 
become the 29th man.

Three
Gridders
by John Blue
The Carnegie Tech Tartans, 
hoping to bounce back into foot­
ball prominence after last year’s 
disastrous 1-7 record, take on 
Ohio Wesleyan on their home 
field at 1:30 p.m. this next Satur­
day, September 22.
Coach Eddie Hirshberg will 
have only twelve lettermen from 
last year suited up for the initial 
encounter. Gone from last year’s 
squad are all West Penn 
*>ence end Marty Poad, star quar­
terback Pete Bouxsein, halfback 
Court Burrell, and tackle Mike 
Chuhran. In addition, halfback 
Funman Smith’s status as player 
is doubtful because of his aca­
demic standing. Center Don 
Monti, a letterman last year, will 
be sidelined several weeks due 
a shoulder separation.
Despite the bleakness of the 
outlook for the coming season, 
'^| some bright spots stand out. 
Three-letter man Larry Arrendas 
at end may team up with trans­
fer student Ken Bechtel to pro­
duce a passing attack that will 
somewhat offset the smallness of 
the team as a whole. Halfback A1 
Abels can overcome the handi­
cap of size to gain yardage. Ex­
perienced guards and tackles 
should be able to give the back- 
field running or passing room.
^ One other factor may enter into 
the outcome of games this season. 
Team morale has remained high 
during the two-a-day practices 
since Labor Day. Desire, the key 
to any tight game, was evident as 
Tech scrimmaged California State 
Teachers last Wednesday. Playing 
with only 28 men suited up, the 
Tartans gave a good account of 
themselves against the three- 
platooning California team. “I 
J was very well pleased with the 
scrimmage. Teams like Ohio Wes­
leyan and Dennison play three 
platoon football while we are 
having trouble fielding one,” said 
Coach Hirshberg after the game. 
Athletic Director Mel Cratsley had 
this to say about the size of the 
squad: “It may be one of the 
smallest squads as far as numbers 
go that we’ve had in recent years, 
but you can consider all 28 of 
9- them football players. In the past, 
we have always had some disin­
terested boys out for the squad, 
but this entire team is really 
working hard.”
In the opener, Tech fans will 
see a new offense and defense. 
Says Coach Hirshberg, “We are 
installing a mobile offense and 
defense. We don’t have the type 
of boys here at Tech to play power 
football so we have to rely on 
* agility.”
In spite of the difficulties of 
working with a small relatively 
inexperienced squad, Coach Hirsh­
berg regards his boys very high­
ly.” “At a school like Tech, a boy 
has to be a really good student to 
gain admission. Football then 
takes a lot of his time, and he is 
given nothing in the classroom 
because he is an athlete. A boy 
^ that is out for football deserves 
a lot of credit.” But, he is quick 
to add, “This is as it should be.” 
“Optimistic” would not be the 
word to describe the outlook of 
the people connected with the 
team, but, neither would “pessi­
mistic.” In a cautious voice Ath­
letic Director Cratsley echoed the 
sentiments of the coaches, “We 
won’t be undefeated, but we will 
be worth watching. We will win 
some ball games.” Hopefully, he 
is right.
The tentative starting lineup for 
the Ohio Wesleyan game is:
End—Larry Arrendas, Dave D’- 
Appolonia 
Tackle—Duane Palmo, Pete Man- 
garella
Guard—Jack Love, Kent Baldauf 
Center—John Mordecai

Intramural Athletics get very 
little publicity during Freshman 
Orientation. Unless one joins a 
fraternity or becomes associated 
with a dormitory team, he will not 
participate in a single intermural 
athletic event; nor wiL he care. 
Information about intramurals 
sort of spreads by word of mouth 
and by brief articles on the back 
page of the Tartan.
The truth is, CIT, has one of the 
finest intramural programs in col­
legiate athletics. It asumes greater 
importance than most intramurals 
at other colleges because of the 
de-emphasis of varsity sports at 
Tech. Nevertheless, many of 
Tech’s students know little about 
the machinery that is able to run 
twenty-one different sports in 
which over half of the student 
body participates.
Administration Endorsement
There is no doubt that intra­
mural athletics offer the individ­
ual student a great opportunity 
for relaxation, physical fitness, 
competition, friendship, and a 
doggone good time. They are fully 
endorsed by the school admini­
stration.
Intramurals play an important 
part in campus life, and I hope all 
students who are physically able 
to do so will take full advantage 
of them!” said President Warner.
“These contests offer diversions 
from a strenuous stud} schedule 
and the fun of competing with 
other organized groups. They help 
to develop many personal traits 
which future employers will value
— self-control, discipline, friend­
liness, and a well-rounded per­
sonality.” F. M. Cratsley, Director 
of Athletics.
Anyone can participate in intra­
murals. No special athletic ability 
is necessary.
“It is the desire of the govern­
ing bodies of the Intramural Ath­
letic Department to provide a pro­
gram of the widest possible scope. 
Keeping in mind the purposes and 
aims set forth, we feel that there 
is an activity for you, which will 
afford you the opportunity to par­
ticipate regardless of past experi­
ences or skill.” E. L. Boyer, Direc­
tor of Intramural Athletics.
Organization 
The main governing body of the 
Intramural Department is the In­
tramural Board which is super­
vised by the Director of Intra­
mural Athletics. The board con­
sists of six fraternity men chosen 
by C. F. P., two" dormitory men 
chosen by Dormitory Council, one 
independent, and one representa­
tive from the Intramural Man­
ager’s Club. These men work out 
rules, regulations, changes, pro­
tests, and forfeits concerning in­
tramural contests. Its purpose is 
set forth in Article II, Section T of 
its constitution.
“The purpose of this organiza­
tion is to promote student health 
and physical efficiency, to foster a 
spirit of enthusiasm, good sports­
manship, and healthful rivalry 
through the medium of competi­
tive athletics.”
All-Sports Trophy 
In order to enhance competition 
in intramurals, and emphasize the 
minor sports, the Intramural Pro­
gram was revamped four years 
ago under the direction of Eugene 
Boyer. A point system was insti­
tuted, and the organization gain- ^ 
ing the most points during the 
school year is presented with the 
“All Sports” trophy, emblematic 
of supremacy in intramural sports 
for that year.
The point system that applies to 
the “Alll Sports” trophy is out­
lined below:
Major sports are designed by 
the Intramural Constitutions. In-
termediate sports have ninety or 
more participants, and minor 
sports have less than ninety. It 
is obvious from this long list of 
sports that the Intramural Depart­
ment is a large, sprawling organi­
zation which must be well or­
ganized to function at all.
As anyone can easily see, the 
spirit of intramural athletics rep- j 
resents participation in many 
sports, If you are looking for the 
thrill of competition, the friend­
ship of teamwork, the glory from 
winning, or just relaxation from 
studies, try intramurals.
