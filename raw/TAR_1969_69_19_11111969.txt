In the continuing program “Cul­
tures in Contact,” His Excellency
E. M. Debrah, Ambassador Extra­
ordinary and Plenipotentiary of 
Ghana to the United States, lec­
tured Thursday, November 6, on 
the complex process of nation- 
building in West Africa.
His Excellency Debrah was 
educated in Ghana and in Great 
Britain and has served his coun­
try by working for the national­
istic cause in Ghana, in diplo­
matic foreign affairs and currently 
as an Ambassador to the United 
States.
Ghana flourished as the Afri­
can tribal units with similar cul­
tural backgrounds were brought to­
gether geographically.
As the Europeans began coloniz­
ing the continent for trade and raw- 
materials, the European sphere of 
influence spread over Africa 
with all the corrupting implica­
tions and consequences. Soon 
slaves were on the purchasing 
block and the partitioning of Af­
rica was merely an effort to set­
tle European claims. This arbit­
rary partitioning, done geographi­
cally, split tribes and families 
and created an unharmonious at­
titude among the native people 
of Ghana and all the other Gold 
Coast countries Under European 
exploitation.
The colonies and tribes were 
ordered to solely serve the col­
onial powers and were not en­
couraged to build an economic 
basis of their own.
Education for the colonies was 
minimal. Missionaries from Europe 
attempted to educate the tribal 
members but there was little re­
sponse. Consequently, because of 
lack of education, the European 
governing powers in the colonies 
would exclude the natives from 
policy making and all decisions 
that directly affected the masses.
The colonies were to reply com­
pletely on the mother state for 
their existence, “to discourage 
any sign of industrialization.”
Agitation for freedom and in­
dependence from the European 
grasp on Africa was deep seat­
ed in the masses. In the late 
1950’s the British West Africa sys­
tem collapsed. Tribes began plac­
ing national interest above tribal 
affairs and the native groups began 
striving for a nation that would be 
unified and not severed by the 
hands of Europeans. They want­
ed a “charismatic leader to ini­
tiate a new era of propserity.”
Constitutions based on Euro­
peans standards were not appli­
cable for the Africans as it was 
alien to West African thinking.
Lack of trained personnel in 
West Africa became a problem 
for those desiring independence. 
A single party system was cor­
rupt and did not fully represent 
the people. Huge sums of money 
were needed from the national 
revenue to set up industry to sus­
tain the new nation, an economic 
system that could fully provide 
proper facilities. The Europeans 
forced the colonies to export raw 
materials and not transform them
into products they could use bene­
ficially at home. The total result 
was self-defeating economic acti­
vity in the realm of a rising pop­
ulation which produced problems 
of food, medicine, education, 
etc.
Mr. Debrah stated that it is 
essentialy that a country must de­
termine its priorities and develop 
its own skills and agricultural 
potential before it is ready for in­
dependence and a true freedom. 
It is important that poorer coun­
tries receive a fair share of the 
market to be able to cope with the 
consequences of the population 
growth that was far outstripping 
the economic development.
A new nation must also have a 
strict code and enforcement of 
discipline to avoid inefficiencies 
and corruptions of the govern­
ment and to precipitate a total na­
tional consciousness. The masses 
must be able to rely on the 
luxuries of their own country. 
And in this way the people of 
West Africa will be “truly build­
ing the nation.”
The steam for the entire Cam­
pus, with the exception of Scaife 
Hall, will be shut off at approx­
imately midnight on Wednesday, 
November 26, 1969, to allow for 
relocation of steam lines within the 
new Research-Computer Build­
ing.
During this time, there will be 
no steam for heat, hot water, or
A compilation of all the stu­
dents’ evaluations has been sent 
to each department head and other 
administrators, and is available 
in Dean Hayes’ office. Due to the 
confidential nature of the tea­
cher evaluations, teachers’ names 
have been removed from all 
copies save that of the depart­
ment head. Nowhere has any stu­
dent’s name been mentioned, for 
the same reasons.

Ripest Protest 
Lens Affirms
Addressing a crowd of “fellow 
professional anarchists” in the 
C-MU Ballroom Friday night, Sid­
ney Lens, co-chairman of the New 
Mobilization Committee to End 
the War in Vietnam, affirmed his 
belief that the March on Washing­
ton will be nonviolent.
Mr. Lens accused the Nixon ad­
ministration of “redbaiting and 
violence baiting” in its refusal to 
grant a permit to the marchers.
* We want to convince fellow 
Americans that this is a rotten, 
lousy, illegal war that we’re in, 
and we intend to have a peaceful 
demonstration,” Mr. Lens said. 
He added that plans for 3,000-6,-
000 marshals, and 600 legal mar­
shals. "If the government lets us, 
this will be the biggest protest in 
American history, and the most 
non-violent.”
“I was waiting for an historic 
speech the other night when Pres­
ident Nixon spoke. But the speech 
was so bad, so devoid of content, 
that everyone must have been 
convinced that there was a secret 
part of the speech, a brilliant plan 
that only he and Pat know about,” 
Lens said.
After a teach-in like discussion, 
Mr. Lens called upon his audience 
to ‘ have no fear or shame of new 
ideas.” The crowd responded with 
applause, and some awarded Lens 
a standing ovation.
Heat Shut Off-Nov. 26

---------------------------------------------------

Page 2 — THE TARTAN — Tuesday, November 11, 1969LETRSOTHD
We were disturbed recently by reports that the National 
Guard, who have been called up for the March on Wash­
ington this week, has been “urged” to display American flags 
and dim their lights as signs of protest against the March.
We confronted this same kind of situation during the Octo­
ber 15 Moratorium when every policeman on duty displayed 
the flag. Although we were not able to discover whether these 
flags on motorcycle handlebars were bought by the City, we 
doubt that there is total unanimity within any large organization 
which would warrant the 100 per cent display of such a sym­
bol. Other facts also indicate that the force did not display 
the flags totally voluntarily, i.e., several policemen gave us the 
peace sign “under cover” as they rode by.
What disturbs us about the National Guard is essentially 
two-fold. We have been under the impression that in a democ­
racy people in any organization may privately think anything 
they want to as long as they perform their assigned function. 
Certainly all Dow Chemical employees would not voluntarily 
wear pro-chemical warfare buttons, nor would they be forced to 
do so. It seems to us that even those who are employed by the 
federal government should not have to display signs in support of 
administration policy unless they chose to do so. Requiring the 
force to display the flag, especially as a symbol of political 
opinion, is anti-democratic. National Guard members can keep 
the peace in Washington (and its questionable whether they 
will even be necessary) without the use of a flag.
The second bothersome fact about the “request” is that 
underlying it is the assumption that those who participate in
the march are doing so for unpatroitic reasons. This simply is 
not so.
Of course, there are many who would refuse to carry the 
American flag. In fact, some might not want to carry any flag 
at all. Other marchers will carry the United Nations] flag 
in demonstration of their belief in world organization as the 
only viable way of achieveing peace.
Yet there are many who sincerely believe that what they 
are doing is patroitic. This country was founded in the belief 
that open dissent is necessary if the government is to be re­
sponsive to the governed. Nothing in our form of government 
asserts that dissenting from the government’s official policy 
is not in keeping with belief in this nation’s basic ideology.
Mr. Hubert Humphrey made a statement during the Octo­
ber 15 Moratorium that he did not realize just how out of favor 
the Johnson administration was with the American public 
until he was out of office and back “among thepeople.” Cer­
tainly, Mr. Nixon must be confronting the same problem. It 
must be very difficult, despite the number of telegrams he has 
received, to judge American public opinion when the only 
people you speak to at any length are members of the CIA, 
Defense Department, Department of State, and other high, out- 
of touch officials.
We feel it is our patriotic duty to inform Mr. Nixon — loud 
v and clear — how we feel about the war. We think that the basic 
system is a good one but that there are inequities and injus­
tices within it. By marching, we are saying that we believe 
those things can be changed.
We will be carrying American flags to demonstrate our 
faith. We hope that others that believe in the system will carry 
the flag too.

Article on Von Braun Attacked by Students
Editor, the Tartan;
Upon reading Chuck Daly’s • 
article on Dr. von Braun’s visit to 
C-MU, one can only hope that he 
bothers to research his next sub­
ject before he attempts to write 
about it. The opinions expressed 
by Mr. Daly and his slanting of 
the facts should be reserved for 
the editorial page at best, not as 
a news item. This is not only a 
disservice to Dr. von Braun but 
also to the student body that did 
not attend the lecture. After read­
ing his article one wonders whether 
Mr. Daly bothered to attend the 
lecture.
Contrary to Mr. Daly’s “facts,” 
invitations were available to the 
student body through the Mech­
anical Engineering Departments, 
who sponsored Dr. von Braun’s 
visit, or in Warner Hall, as indi­
cated on posters circulated about 
the campus. As a result, many 
C-MU students were present. 
Even those who did not have 
tickets could observe via closed 
circuit TV in the Wherret Room.
Mr. Daly states that all that was 
presented by Dr. von Braun for 
post-Apollo programs was more of 
the same “apollo like” programs,
i.e., “space students” to Mr. Daly’s 
way of thinking. It is hard to im­
agine how anyone could have in­
ferred that from von Braun’s 
talk unless he went there with 
that notion preconceived in a clos­
ed mind. Dr. von Braun outlined 
a program to greatly reduce the 
cost of space flight and to in­
crease the direct benefits to man­
kind. If that’s a stunt, one ques­
tions Mr. Daly’s foresight, or 
lack thereof.
The article also mentioned one 
use of the weightless condition in 
space, that of the development of 
metal foams. Mr. Daly then states 
that “the one use for such metal 
foams which Dr. Von Braun sug­
gested — its use in jet propellors 
(?) hardly justifies the great cost 
of a program such as our space 
journeys.” Of course it doesn’t! 
As Mr. Daly himself states, it just 
ONE use of just ONE process. 
One wonders how the impact of 
this statement would be changed if 
Mr. Daly used another example 
given for the use of metal foams, 
namely the creation of synthetic 
bone structures for use in medi­
cine. And this was just a discus­
sion of an industrial process not 
to mention the uses of space to the 
sciences and medicine (such as 
weightless hospitals for cardiac 
patients.)
Mr. Daly also mentions crop sur­
veying world wide from space and 
concludes that since Dr. von 
Braun didn’t mention a date for 
this system to be operational, 
that is was only being talked 
about and not being built. If Mr. 
Daly would bother to research 
the subject, he would find 
that it is planned to have such a 
system in operation in the early
‘70 s, not only for crop surveys 
but for resource surveys and con­
servation, ocean surveys for fish­
ing management and air and water 
pollution control. This is in ad­
dition to our present communica­
tion and weather satellite systems.
Finally, Mr. Daly states that 
“ . . . von Braun the apologetic 
had naswers for those who criti­
cize the expenditures for space 
exploration.” Come now! Apolo­
getic for one of the few govern­
ment programs where the taxpay­
er is getting what he pays for — 
that’s hard to believe. There is 
probably several times the NASA 
annual budget, about 4 billion 
dollars, wasted by inefficiences in 
HEW with an annual budget of 
about 54 billion dollars. (This is 
not to advocate a reduction in 
HEW funds, but just to cite 
an example of inefficiency). Also 
Americans spend more on alo- 
chol and cigarettes in one year 
than NASA spends in several. 
Anything to be “apologetic” 
about would be the lack of a 
“public relations job” done to show 
the public the promise and bene­
fits of space exploration.
One hopes that Arthur C. Clark 
will at lease receive complete if 
not impartial coverage during his 
visit to C-MU next week.
Richard DeMeis 
Graduate Student
Applied Space Science Program
Editor, The Tartan:
After reading the article on 
Werner von Braun’s talk, I am 
a little bit disgusted. Why don’t 
you and your staff keep personal 
feelings and comments in their 
place? Instead of giving a fac­
tual account of what had been, 
we are throughly saturated with 
one person’s opinion.
I would like to present a dif­
ferent view and though it is my 
own, I consider it far closer to 
actual fact. I will take up a few 
of the “facts” presented in your 
article.
(1) It was stated that invitations 
were mailed only to “friends of 
the University” and faculty and 
that few students attended.
Do you really think the Uni­
versity would mail thousands of 
invitations to all of its students? 
Did you ever notice that for days 
before the lecture tickets were 
available, to anyone who went to 
Warner Hall, and picked them
up? Also, from what I saw, quite 
a number of students showed up.
(2) It is stated in the article 
that the metal form is one example 
of space technology that can only 
be used in jet propellors. It 
is strongly implied that this is 
the only possible good available 
from the space program.
I ask you all: Do jets have 
propellors? Besides this obvious 
blunder the author neglected to 
mention vonBraun’s discussion 
of the facts that scientists are 
continually searching for other 
processes possible in space, such 
as the growth of large semiconduc­
tor crystals. Von Braun also said 
the scientists were open to sug­
gestions of experiments who could 
be done.
I also wish to ask exactly what 
is so terribly wrong with more 
Apollo missions. Why is it implied 
that they are all a waste of mon­
ey?
The “spinoff” from the space 
program has in itself proved to 
be worth more than originally 
thought. Requirements of the 
space program brought about rapid 
development of transistors, min- 
eaturized circuitry and finally in­
tegrated circuits.
Granted, the space program 
wastes money, but what agency 
affiliated with government does 
not? Does the space program use 
money to manufacture quantities 
of poison gas? Is the space pro­
gram actively engaged in design­
ing new and better means of de­
stroying the human race? It ap­
pears to me that the overall ef­
fect of space program is good and 
the research related to the program 
will result in advances applicable 
to the regular “man in the street” 
that will more than justify the 
money now being spend on moon 
shots and space stations.

To whoever took my purse during “Black Without Blackness” 
last Monday night : Thank you for dumping my wallet in 
a place where the Post Office was able to return it to me. How­
ever, if you know the whereabouts of the purse and/or its con- 
tenst now, wouldn’t you please turn it in to Security or the main 
desk at Skibo? I need some of the contents very badly, such as my 
glasses, thanks,

Tartan Attacked for Non-objective Reporting
Editor. The Tartan;
Apparently the thirteen people 
who wrote the letters concerning 
Von Braun which appeared on 
this page in the Friday, Novem­
ber 7 edition failed outright in 
their purpose. On the reverse side 
(the front page) there appeared 
another story which, if not an 
editorial, fell nothing short of 
being a very pedestrian melo­
drama. Miss Digby certainly has 
missed her calling as a novel­
ist. judging by her impassioned 
account of the events surrounding 
the arrest of Gary Magil.
Whether or not one agrees that 
election laws were being viol­
ated in this case, and whether or 
not one believes that Mr. Magil 
was justified in his actions, as a 
newspaper reporter one has an 
obligation to present the facts ac­
curately, completely, and without 
partiality to a particular point of 
view. Furthermore, the use of em­
otional and dramatic language is 
not justified. And finally, evalu­
ations such as " . . . . the whole 
procedure was handled fairly 
well . . .” are simply not the pero- 
gative of the writer of a front 
page story.
At the beginning of the year, 
the Tartan was allotted a great 
deal of additional money in or­
der to finance two editions per 
week. The rationale for this ac­
tion was to give students at this 
university more complete coverage 
of events relating to them. But 
I can’t see that this has happened. 
If the present trend in reporting 
by this paper continues (and I 
imagine it will), then I think the 
money was wasted, and would 
have liked to see it spend on 
something more worthwhile.

BCC Crisis
Editor, the Tartan 
Governmental response to the 
construction crisis at CMU, as 
reported in a recent issue of the 
Tartan, has been discouraging, 
-though not disappointing to those 
®vho long ago learned to expect 
little from this source. Nixon has 
apparently been too busy working 
on his startling new peace plans 
to answer Dr. Stever’s telegram, 
while the Attorney General has 
apparently been tied up with 
court efforts to prevent desegre­
gation of Mississippi school dis­
tricts, and has therefore understand­
ably not had the time to initiate 
court action against racial- dis­
crimination in the construction in­
dustry. In the meantime, HEW 
compliance inspectors sent to 
Pittsburgh have left town, appar­
ently without telling what they 
found or whether they plan to re­
turn.
Since the government shows no 
signs of acting promptly, I won­
der whether it may not be in 
order for the university to ini­
tiate court action on its own. 
At Tufts, where a crisis similar to 
our own occurred recently, the 
university has filed a suit ask­
ing the court to determine whether 
its building contractors are in 
compliance with standards of 
equal employment practice. CMU 
should consider the possibility 
' of entering a similar suit here; in 
this way the university might ob­
tain a quick determination of the 
facts in the case. We would soon 
know whether discrimination is 
taking place, and would be in an 
excellent position to demand a re­
negotiation of the contract if that 
proved necessary, or to obtain a 
court order against those prac-
* ticing discrimination if that seem-
* ed suitable. At the same time, the 
university would avoid the large 
financial risks involved in a uni­
lateral moratorium on construc­
tion. In obtaining legal advice on 
this question, the University 
might do well to consult a differ­
ent law firm than the one which 
handled the injunction request, 
since a law firm which represents 
the Master Builders Association 
and the construction unions may 
be suspected of inability to give 
unbiased advice on the questions 
involved in this issue.

Blood Donors
Editor, The Tartan;
The C-MU Student-Faculty 
Blood Drive on November 4, 
conducted by Gamma Sigma Sig­
ma was very successful. A to­
tal of seventy-seven people came 
to donate blood, with only four­
teen unable to give for medical 
reasons. We wish to thank all 
the people who helped in this 
project.
We also wish to apologize for 
any inconvenience. The Central 
Blood Bank called Peggy Grig- 
lak on October 31st, the Friday 
before the drive, cancelling the 
Wednesday date and sending out 
a smaller mobile unit instead of 
the larger one requested by 
Gamma Sig. However, as the num­
ber of donors waiting for their ap­
pointments increased, the nurses 
called for the larger unit. After 
that, the drive went smoothly. 
These inconveniences willnot 
happen at the drive next year.

Okitunji’s Many Dances
The Oltaunji concert of Afri­
can music last Saturday night fil­
led the gymnasium to capacity. 
Shortly after 9 p.m. Olatunji and 
his group of five dancers and five 
drummers walked onto the stage. 
Olatunji invited everyone to relax 
and participate if the spirit moved 
them. He gave thanks that they 
had been able to make it this 
night, since they had been de­
layed by a flat tire en route.
For two hours that evening the 
ensemble wove a spell of enchant­
ment over the audience. The vivid 
colors and wild movements of the 
dancers in combination with the 
rhythm of the drums was an over­
powering emotional experience. 
The music had a strong primitive

quality to it; with complex rhy­
thms and surprisingly wide range 
of tonal variations.
Olatunji played two tall wood­
en drums of different pitch, and 
demonstrated a small box-like 
instrument called, among other 
things, Lukimba or mbeela. This 
instrument, he said, was a predeces­
sor to the bass of today. Oltaunji 
also made various sounds by blow- 
ingo his hands which were arrang­
ed in a special way.
During Agadoon, the dance of 
giving thanks, one of the dancers, 
Brother Ali, contorted his body into 
positions one would not think 
possible of the human body. Olat­
unji explained this as being part 
of a religion in which the body 
must be properly cared for.
At one point, during the second 
half of the concert, several 
Blacks climbed up on stage and
danced to the drums. Throughout, 
the audience clapped and chant­
ed, hypotnized by the music. Num­
erous times blacks stood up rais­
ing clenched fists in a show of 
black power.
A very dramatic dance was the 
dance of the soul in which a dan­
cer in a sack grew and shrank from 
two to fourteen feet.
The finale was a spectacular 
fire dance. The lead male dancer 
danced with fire, swallowing and 
breathing it as he danced around 
two fires on the floor. This per­
formance merited a standing ova­
tion.
The concert was a very success­
ful climax to the week-long Afri­
can Symposium. It was a way of 
closing the gap between Africa 
and America, between black and 
white, through understanding the 
other’s culture.

Features Dr. Stevens
by ANDILIEBERMAN
Dr. Richard Stevens spoke to 
C-MU students and faculty on 
November 7 in the Wherrett Room 
as part of “Cultures in Contact,” 
the African Symposium. In ac­
cordance with the objective of 
the Symposium to “draw our at­
tention to the little-known his­
tory of a major segment of man­
kind,” Dr. Stevens spoke about the 
“Relevance of African Studies to 
the American Scene.”
Dr. Stevens had done exten­
sive research on Africa and Afri­
can Affairs, has travelled in Af­
rica and has published several 
articles and a book on the sub­
ject. He received his B.A. from 
Notre Dame University and his 
M.A. and Ph.D. from George­
town University. He is currently 
Professor and Head of African 
Studies at Lincoln University of 
Pennsylvania.
According to Dr. Stevens, Af­
rican studies mean a restoration 
of heritage to more than 10 per 
cent of the American people. 
They evoke the realization that 
Africa has contributed to and has
been influnced by world culture. 
They also help to shed ethnocen­
tric concepts and better under­
standing of human values and 
differences. Most important, how­
ever, the studies show the direct 
relationship of the black position 
in the United States of the pow­
er structure.
The major concern of Dr. 
Stevens at Lincoln University is 
to reflect that today voices are 
being heard that have been 
heretofore silent. He wants to 
generate an understanding of 
power realities by approaching 
the fact that the United States 
Constitution was based on a com­
bination of self-interest and ideal­
ism — excluding, however, the 
blacks.
In conclusion, Dr. Stevens pro­
jected that the pursuit of Afri­
can Studies would “throw light on 
a situation taken for natural,” 
and as one that “one can do noth­
ing about.”
A luncheon and panel discussion 
followed.

This fall Alpha Phi Omega 
will conduct another Faculty- 
Course Evaluation (FCE) during 
the week of Nov. 17-21. The 
purpose is twofold: (1) To help 
the students choose their elec­
tives more intelligently now that 
more electives are becoming 
available both inside and outside 
one’s department, and (2) To 
acquaint the departments with the 
student opinions of their teachers 
and courses.
This being only the third FCE 
A Phi O has run they are still ex­
perimenting with both the ques­
tionnaire and the method pf per­
forming the evaluation. Last fall 
A Phi O sent its members into 
the classrooms with the permis­
sion of the teachers. The result 
was 312 courses in CIT nad H & 
SS were covered with an average of 
over 50 per cent of the class’s 
students participating. Last spring, 
in an effort to cover more cour­
ses, questionnaires were mailed to 
all undergraduate students in 
C-MU. The results were disappoint­
ing; while many more courses were 
evaluated the average percentage 
of participation by a class’s stu­
dents was very low. Only the re­
sults of last fall’s FCE were pub­
lished and are still available.
This fall the FCE will be car­
ried out in a different way. The 
professors are being asked to con­
duct the evaluation in their own 
classes because A Phi 0 simply 
has not enough members to go in­
to the classrooms themselves, 
rhe evaluation this fall is aimed 
at all courses outside of Fine Arts 
because no suitable questionnaire 
for FA has been found. This fall’s 
fee will be published and sold in 
the spring.

CMU started fast and finished fast in Saturday’s game at Western Reserve and easily 
took the decision 41-12. The victory was the Tartan’s third straight and was once again high­
lighted by the strong running of Terry Bell and Tom Lombardo, and another fine effort by 
the defensive units. Bell picked up 132 yards on 24 carries and scored two touchdowns to lead 
the Tech offense. ___________________________________________________________
The only time the Western 
Reserve team threatened to make 
a game of it was at the end of 
the first half and the beginning 
of the third quarter. But the Tar­
tans had already done most of its 
damage, staying mostly on the 
ground while building a command­
ing 28-0 lead.
The defensive unit set up the 
first Tartan touchdown early in 
the opening period. Jack Dzura’s 
jarring tackle caused QB Angelo 
Valentikto fumble and Gary 
Meilahn recovered for CMU on 
the Reserve 39. Lombardo gained 
three yards and Bell covered the 
final 36 on three straight carries, 
the last one an 18 yard dash for 
the six points.
At the end of the first 
quarter, Bell scored again to cap 
an 80 yard sustained drive. The 
ground game was so successful 
that Rich Squires had to put the 
ball in the air only two times for 
short gains. Following Bell’s 
one yard plunge, Mark Wood 
converted the second of his five 
extra point kicks for the after­
noon.
Three minutes later the Tar­
tans were on the scoreboard again 
when Squires scored from nine 
yards out after he was unable to 
find an open receiver.
Midway through the second 
quarter Tech marched 53 yards 
through the Reserve defense for 
a 28-0 edge.
This time Squires kept the 
drive going by connecting on cru­
cial third down passes to Chuck 
Price and Lombardo. The score 
came on the patented screen pass 
to Tony Bugel who followed a 
wall of blockers 28 yards into the 
endzone.
With less than a minute re­
maining in the first half, the 
Redcats recovered a fumble on 
the CMU 34 and scored on three 
consecutive passes, the last one a 
22-yarder from Valenti to Mike 
Hestel.
Western Reserve opened the 
second half with their best of­
fensive effort of the day, narrow­
ing the margin to 28-12 on a 12 
yards pass from Valenti to Joe 
Valore.
A little later the Redcats were 
moving the ball again but were 
stopped when Bugel receovered 
a fumble for CMU. After that the 
Tartans regained complete con­
trol of the game and scored twice 
more in the final quarter.
Lombardo dove in from the one 
on a fourth down play to make it 
35-12. Then Dzura’s interception 
deep in Western Reserve terri­
tory set up the final score of the 
day, a 13 yard pass from Squires 
to Price.
The CMU victory was the 
eithth in nine contests against
Western Reserve. The only loss 
was a 15-0 game back in 1911.
The Tartans look like a com­
pletely different team than the 
one that played in the first four 
games this year. Lombardo has 
been running as well as last year, 
since his leg has recovered from 
an injury suffered in pre-sea- 
son practice. Bell and Lombardo 
have given the Tartans’ offense 
better balancy by rolling up big 
yardage week after week.
The defense has come a long 
way since the first game. In the 
last three games only 25 points 
have been scored against CMU. 
John Sabol picked off another 
pass this week and he continues 
to look good at the linebacker 
spot.
Tartan Tidbits;
Terry Bell’s two touchdowns 
gives him 66 points for the sea­
son. If he scores twice more this 
year he will break brother Dick 
Bell’s season scoring mark . . . 
Mark Wood missed the extra point 
after the last touchdown but he 
had connected on eleven straight 
.............Western Reserve’s line­
backer Tom Costa was thrown out 
of the game for unsportsmanlike 
conduct and he certainly deserved 
it. His elbows and fists were 
filying all afternoon, but the 
Tartans got back at hime on one 
punt return late in the game.
The bus ride to and from 
Cleveland was a lot of fun . . . 
Don’t knock the Tech Bowl. It 
is by far the nicest field that the 
team plays on all year. The 
only stadium to come close was 
the one at Allegheny .... There 
was a huge crowd of approxim­
ately 200 reserve students at the 
game, including the band, cheer­
leaders, and football team . . .It 
seems like most of the Reserve 
players are trying to grow beards. 
Unfortunately they are having 
about as much success at that as 
they are having at winning foot­
ball games. WR is 0-7.
Believe it or not, Tom Costa 
is one of the Costa Cousins from
Ellwood City, Pa. The public 
address announcer got all excited 
about that. Also some guy named 
Alexander made his collegiate de­
but Saturday against the Tartans. 
He gained one yard on four car­
ries. He should have stayed in 
high school........
Next Saturday the Tartans 
shoot for a .500 season with a 
home contest against Washing­
ton & Jefferson. CMU easily 
beat the Presidents last year 26-
0 in the Washington Pa. mud. This 
will be the 1969 finale for the 
Tartans and game time is 1:30.

The CMU soccer team dropped 
a hard fought game to the squad 
from Pitt Saturday morning. The 
score was 1-0. Gus Theofolis 
scored the lone goal of the game 
for Pitt in the third quarter when 
he took a throw in, dribbled down 
the left side, and beat Lape, the 
CMU goalie.
Play was even for most of the 
opening quarter. Then Pitt put on 
a sustained offensive attack; how­
ever, the Tartans were able to 
hold them scoreless.
Pitt continued to put the pres­
sure on the Tartans in the second 
quarter but the CMU defense re­
mained tough. Some Great saves 
by John Lape (who had 13 to­
tal) and some muffed shots by 
Panther booters contributed to the 
inability of Pitt to score. So the 
halftime score was 0-0.
After Pitt scored in the fol­
lowing period, the Tartans came 
alive and took some of their best 
shots of the game. But the 
Pitt netminder was equal to the 
task and kept CMU off the score­
board to preserve the Panther’s 
victory.
