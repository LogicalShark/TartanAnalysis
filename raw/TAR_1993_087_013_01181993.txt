By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Student Senate Chair Greg Haver- 
kamp and Funding & Recognition (F&R) 
Chair David Martin officially announced 
Thursday night to Senate’s Executive 
Committee (ExComm) that starting this 
semester, budgets 
for most Senate- 
funded organiza­
tions will be heard 
in the spring.
Spring Carnival 
and Sweepstakes, 
which spend most 
of their money in 
the fall, will still 
have their budgets 
reviewed in the fall.
The new proposal will extend budget 
hearings an extra day to three days 
within a two week period and all organi­
zational budgets will be comploted be­
fore the new fiscal year begins. Budget 
hearings for this semester will bo on
plansoverhaul
March 9,11, and 16.
If student enrollment is down and 
Student Senate receives less in Student 
Activities Fees than expected, a retroac­
tive cut on all budgets will occur.
Originally, almost half of all organiza­
tional budgets were heard at one meet­
ing in the fall semester, and the remain-
ing budgets were hoard at another meet­
ing in the spring. Budget hearings were 
long, with the past semester's mooting 
lasting for sovon hours, ending at 2 am. 
Also, if studont enrollment fell below

Student found dead in dorm
By MATT ADLER
Tartan Staffuiriter
Ian Gardner, a sophomore com­
puter science major, was found 
dead in his Morewood room over 
winter vacation. Gardner’s body 
was discovered at 3:31 am on 
January 6 when Campus Police 
entered his room at the request of 
his mother, who was concerned 
that no one had heard from him 
since Saturday, January 2. The 
final police report ruled the man­
ner of death an “apparent sui­
cide.”
Gardner was involved in many 
activities and was scheduled to 
work at PRN Ambulance Service, 
where he was a part-time para­
medic, for that entire week. 
Gardner worked for 13 hours on 
Saturday but did not appear for 
work on the following Monday 
morning and did not return any 
phone calls.
At 3:06 am Wednesday morn­
ing Gardner’s mother contacted
Campus Police and gave authori­
zation to enter his room. Accord­
ing to Chief of Campus Police 
James LaPaglia, “[Gardener’s] 
mother was in the habit of hear­
ing from him almost every day.”
The Campus Police officers who 
entered Gardner’s room immedi­
ately notified paramedics, police 
investigators, and campus offi­
cials. Campus and city police con­
ducted an investigation and the 
official results will be given to the 
coroner’s office today.
With approval from Gardner’s 
family, Mike Murphy, dean of 
Student Affairs, and Amy 
Ginther, assistant director of 
Housing for Residence Life, be­
gan contacting Gardner’s close 
friends, beginning with his room­
mates. “By Thursday,” said 
Ginther, “we talked with a couple 
dozen students. Then, when stu­
dents returned to school, we de­
cided to have opportunities for 
each of those important groups of 
Ian’s friends to meet.”
Counselors from the Carnegie 
Mellon Counseling Center facili­
tated group meetings and indi­
vidual discussions with students 
who were friends with Gardner. 
Residents and friends of fourth 
floor Mudge, where Gardner lived 
last semester, and ’Schlag B2, 
where Gardner lived last year, 
have had group discussions with 
a counselor. Also, members of 
Theti Xi fraternity, where 
Gardner was a pledge, had the 
opportunity to meet with a coun­
selor last week.
“It’s nice sharing among 
people,” Ginther said, “to know 
how many people cared about Ian 
and to know that those people 
care about you.... Sharing the 
facts helps to acknowledge the 
loss and combat the sense of shock 
and unreality that everyone is 
feeling.”
The funeral was held Satur­
day, January 9, in Gardner’s 
home town of DeKalb Junction,

Dante walker robot stopped by broken cable
By STEPH STINE

On January 2, the Robotics Institute’s Mt. Erebus 
mission was called off due 
to the disonnection of the 
fiber optical cable con­
necting the eight-legged 
rappeller/walker, Dante, 
to the mission’s control 
site in Antarctica.
According to a UPI re­
port, this misfortune 
halted the Erebus explor­
ers at the foot of the Mt.
15, when hazardous weather conditions occurred.
Despite this undoing, the achievement of the Mt. 
Erebus mission on the whole had been “tremen­
dous” according to project leader Red Whittaker at 
a January 2 video con­
ference. “We’ve written 
overl50,0001inesofnew

used the ground station 
for the first time,” he 
said.

Craig Hutchinson, a CIT sophomore from 
Nashua, N.H., died December 30 at Presbyterian- 
University Hospital in Pittsburgh of a rare blood- 
related viral infection. He was 19.
Hutchinson’s death came after 53 days in the 
intensive care units at Presby and at Montefiore 
Hospital in Pittsburgh. Michael Murphy, dean of 
the Office of Student Affairs, called the efforts 
made by doctors to save Hutchinson’s life “tremen­
dous.”
“They were just not able to save his life,” Murphy 
said. “He put up a heck of a fight.... Tremendous 
efforts were made at Montefiore and at Presby.”
According to Director of Studont Hottlth Sor- 
vicos Anita Barkin during the first woolc of No­
vember, Hutchinson bocumo acutely ill. In a tele­
phone conversation with his mother that week­
end, Bhe urged him to go to the omorgoncy room. 
His roommatos wore finally nbie to convince him 
to follow her advice, and he was admitted to 
Montefiore Hospital on Novombor 8.
“Ho just didn’t want to go,” said John Aldon, 
sophomore mechanical engineering major and 
one ofl-Iutchinson’s roommatos at Doherty Apart­

Iraq condemns resumption 
Of bombing by U.N. coalition
•CYPRUS, January 14 (AP) — Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein said a new 
battle has started againBt U.S.-led coa­
lition forces that bombed southern Iraq 
and killed 19 people, according to an 
official announcement today.
A military communique broadcast by 
the state-run Iraqi News Agency said 15 
other people were wounded, including 
both civilians and military personnel, 
but gave no breakdown.
¦ ¡Separately, Japanese Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa said the air strike on 
liaq by the U.N. coalition was “under­
standable" because it was conducted to 
ensure the implementation of U.N. Se­
curity Council resolutions.
.Miyazawa, currently on a tour of 
Southeast Asian nations, said Japan 
will continue to ask Iraq strongly to 
4bide by U.N. resolutions and refrain 
from acts which could cause tensions in
the Mideast region. “Iraq has continu­
ously taken a provocative attitude 
against the international community. 
The limited use of force by the coalition 
this time was undertaken to ensure the 
implementation of U.N. Security Coun­
cil resolutions, therefore is understand­
able,” he said.
Also, President Bush has warned Iraq 
that even though he leaves office in a 
week, he could order additional military 
strikes if Baghdad keeps violating the 
terms of the Gulf War cease-fire.
“I’m President until the 20th, and I 
will run foreign policy and make these 
kinds of decisions as long as I’m Presi­
dent,” Bush told reporters on Wednes­
day.
Intelligence analysts were saying 
Saddam was unpredictable and might 
not have been chastened by the attack.
“But I would think that Saddam
Hussein would understand that we mean 
what we say and that we back it up. And 
I have no intention of changing that 
approach to life in the last six or seven 
days of my presidency,” said the Presi­
dent.
To back up his warning, Bush ordered 
troops into Kuwait to deter any at­
tempted Iraqi incursion. The military 
said about 1,100 soldiers from the 1st 
Cavalry Division would fly as early as 
today from Fort Hood, Texas, to Kuwait 
and join 300 special operations forces 
already taking part in a military exer­
cise there. In Paris, U.S. Secretary of 
State Lawrence Eagleburger predicted 
that Saddam will be a problem for the 
Clinton administration.
Bush’s moves drew the unreserved 
support of his successor, Bill Clinton, 
who will inherit the difficult Iraq situa­
tion in less than a week.
Supreme Court rules 
on abortion blockade
WASHINGTON, January 13 (DJ)
— The Supreme Court, in a blow to 
abortion-rights advocates, said a Re- 
construction-era civil rights law can­
not be used to prevent blockades of 
abortion clinics by groupB such as Op­
eration Rescue.
The high court said abortion-rights 
groups failed to show that opposition 
to abortion qualifies alongside race 
discrimination as the type of discrimi­
natory conspiracy barred by the 19th 
century law known as the Ku Klux 
Klan Act. Clinics had used the act to 
seek federal court orders prohibiting 
militant abortion protests.
The court said the civil rights law 
requires a showing of “animus” against 
women by reason of their gender. But 
opposition to abortion, the court said, 
can’t reasonably be presumed to re­
flect sex-based discrimination.
The court decision means that” 
women and clinics will have to try to 
use state and local laws to seek court 
orders banning abortion clinic block­
ades.
The court was closely divided, vot­
ing 5-4 that the Ku Klux Klan Act 
does not protect women seeking abor­
tions against clinic protesters.
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the 
majority opinion and was joined by 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist and. 
Justices Byron White, Anthony 
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Jus­
tice David Souter filed a separate^ 
opinion that dissented in part. Jus­
tices John Paul Stevens and Sandra1 
Day O’Connor filed separate dissents, 
both of which Justice Harry Blackmun' 
joined.
White House to 
release Bush tape
WASHINGTON, January 12 
.'(AP) — The White House has 
¦received a copy of President 
/Bush’s 1988 videotaped inter­
view from Iran-Contra prosecu­
tors and will make it public in a 
few days, spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said. Bush will also 
make public relevant parts of 
the diary he kept at that time,
, said Fitzwater.
Fitzwater said release of the 
' interview “will be good for the 
President because it clearly 
'.shows that he doesn’t have any 
'. involvement here that’s ques-
tionable in a legal sense.”
The White House had called 
upon independent counsel 
Lawrence E. Walsh to release 
the interview after Bush par­
doned former Defense Secre­
tary Caspar W. Weinberger and 
five other officials charged with 
wrongdoing or convicted in con­
nection with the Iran-Contra 
affair.
The White House contended 
the tape would rebut critics who 
charged Bush with issuing the 
pardons to cover up his knowl- 
edge of the Iran-Contra affair.
Appointee speaks on Medicare, deficit
WASHINGTON, January 15 
(DJ) — Donna Shalala, Bill 
Clinton’s choice for secretary of 
health and human services, said 
that savings from Medicare and 
Medicaid should be used to ex­
pand health coverage to all Ameri­
cans, not to reduce the deficit.
“The president-elect’s position 
is that we will take those re­
sources and use them to expand 
coverage,” said the chancellor of 
the University of Wisconsin at 
Madison. Her comment came in 
response to a question during a 
Senate Finance Committee hear­
ing on her nomination. Clinton’s 
economic and health-policy ad­
visers have been debating how to
spend the savings from Medicare 
and Medicaid.
The finance committee posed 
the same question earlier this 
week to Lloyd Bentsen, its former
“What you are trying to do is first 
impress the world that you are 
getting that deficit down.” 
Shalala stressed that Clinton 
is committed to sending Congress
days of his administration. “It 
will be a reasonable period of 
time,” she said.
She said the plan will include a 
national budget for both public 
and private health-care expendi­
tures, as Clinton promised dur­
ing his campaign.
In addition, Shalala reiterated 
Clinton’s pledge to lift the bans 
on abortion counseling at feder­
ally financed clinics and on fed­
eral financing for research using 
tissue from aborted fetuses. And 
she also called for more federal 
resources to be devoted to fight­
ing AIDS. The Finance Commit­
tee is planning to vote onShalala’p 
nomination on Tuesday. ,M,
Environmental issues left for
interior defers on spotted owl issue
WASHINGTON, January 15 (DJ) — Interior 
Secrotary Manuel Lujan deferred an important 
decision on the northern spotted owl, officially 
handing the hotly contested issue over to the 
Clinton administration.
Also, Lujan withdrew a proposed policy change 
aimed at, making it less attractive for conserva- 
l-ion groups to buy land and soli it to the govern­
ment.
. ¡Lujan said he will scok additional comment on 
tlio so-called rocovery plan for the owl, leaving 
approval of a final plan to the now administration, 
¦me proposed recovory plan, required by law, is 
jumed at ensuring the long-term survival of the
threatened species. Lujan said he took the action 
to provide the “best possible information” for 
Clinton to use at a forest summit scheduled for 
later this year.
In abandoning the land-acquisition proposal, 
Lujan said he is asking the Interior Department’s 
inspector general to make additional audits to 
determine if taxpayers are being hurt by the land 
sales and whether the transactions distort federal 
land-acquisition priorities.
Under a typical arrangement, a nonprofit group 
buys land when federal funds aren’t available for 
the purchase. Later, the federal government buys 
the land from the group.
“What you are trying to do is first 
impress the world that you are get­
ting that deficit down.”

chairman and now Clinton’s a broad health-care reform pro­
nominee for Treasury secretary, posal, but she declined to say

Labor delays passive smoking rules
dence of effects in the workplace.
So Labor Secretary Lynn Martin determined 
that broad emergency workplace rules would be 
premature. Instead, the agency will review sec- 
ond-hand smoke in workplaces separately from a 
massive, longer-term project to examine worksite 
air quality, a review expected to be under way 
when Robert Reich becomes secretary next week.
WASHINGTON, January 15 (DJ) — The Labor 
Department decided to leave workplace rules on 
second-hand smoke to the Clinton Administra­
tion, opting instead to step up research.
Questions surrounding “passive” tobacco smoke 
took on new urgency last week when the Environ­
mental Protection Agency reported that the smoke 
is a human-lung carcinogen, spurring officials at 
the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA) to review options 
of how to treat smoke in workplaces.
But OSHA Acting Administrator Dorothy Strunk 
argued that the EPA report focuses on the risk of 
passive smoke in households, offering weaker evi-

F&R to institute new budget processAll student organizations to become spring budgets
SENATE, from page 1
Student Senate’s expected figure, spring bud­
gets would be subject to unfair budget cuts 
[“Senate proposes budget cuts,” 11/16/92]. 
Those organizations which had fall budgets 
ivere spending money before money was given 
to. them in the spring, according to 
Haverkamp. “I felt there was a serious prob­
lem with fall budgets. They’re spending be­
fore they have money,” said Martin. He said 
that as a result, “We decided to push all 
budgets to the spring except Carnival and 
Sweepstakes.”
According to Haverkamp, the new pro­
posal is just a réintroduction to an old policy. 
‘This used to be done before,” says 
Haverkamp, “where every group was done in 
the spring. It changed because fall Senators 
complained that they couldn’t hear budgets.” 
Loomis agrees, “In the past, it was more 
important to be a spring Senator. Now, it’s 
pven more important to be a spring Senator.” 
Senate’s Public Relations/Human Re­
sources Chair Shawn Knight said, “They say, 
llfit ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Well, the system 
has broken.”
The new proposal is a result of former F&R 
Chair Michael Loomis’ requests for reforms 
in Student Senate’s F&R Committee. At Stu-
dent Senate's committee chair elections on 
December 1, Loomis recommended to Mar­
tin that changes were necessary in the bud­
get-hearing process.
For example, Loomis said he would like to 
see three or four meetings per year instead of 
the current two meetings per year. Also, 
Loomis said, “I’d like to see it set up so all 
budgets are done a year in advance, so they 
can be seen more carefully.” During finals 
week, Haverkamp andMartinmetwithAnne 
Witchner of Student Activities to discuss 
changes in how to run F&R.
Haverkamp said that the new proposal is 
“a benefit to everybody as a whole.” For 
Student Senate, an extra day for budget 
hearings will result in more time per organi­
zation. Before, according to Knight, “every­
body takes the attitude of wanting to go 
home.” Knight calls the proposal “more prac­
tical and useful.” He said, “Groups want 
more [money], so now they will be spread out 
more within a certain amount of time.”
For organizations, Martin sent letters this 
past Wednesday to organizations explaining 
the new proposal. At today’s meeting for 
organizations participating in tomorrow’s 
Activities Fair, Martin plans to distribute an 
information packet containing a computer
disk to Senate-recognized groups and organi­
zations with budgot information.
For the first time, budget information will 
be kept on a disk to save time and paper. 
Martin says that to save time at budget 
hearings, organizations will type in under 
each budget category on an electronic file the 
reasons why they need the amount of money 
they indicate.
Though Martin is holding off on deciding 
which organizations will be heard on which 
days, he admits that he is going to be very 
strict on deadlines. February 9 is the “inter­
mediate date” on which all disks must be 
back to Student Senate by 5 pm. Organiza­
tions will be allowed to hand in late disks 
until February 13, but those organizations 
will be heard last. After February 13, Senate 
will not accept any disks and those groups 
who fail to turn a disk in will not be heard by 
the F&R Committee.
“I am going to need the utmost cooperation 
from student organizations. I expect it to run 
fairly smoothly, but not so smoothly that 
people will consider me a god when I’m done,” 
says Martin.
According to Haverkamp, ExComm mem­
bers are very optimistic about the new bud­
get procedure.

Student Government treasurer Laefer resigns
Crime and Incident Report
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
; Tartan News Editor
' Jay Laefer, senior computer science major, re- 
.‘Signed from his position as Student Government 
* Treasurer at the end of the fall 1992 semester.
' Formerly employed by CMU Univeristy Comput- 
I ing, he is now in Southern California working for 
I Gordian, a communications hardware and soft­
ware company.
Laefer is most noted for hiB accomplishments 
ith regard to the funding process during his term 
;j^s Treasurer including the resolution of the Voices 
VjJInited Gospel Choir (VUGC) funding issue, the 
¦Unprecedented auditing of student organization 
iliudgets, and his actions to prevent deficit spend­
ing of the Activities Fee by Student Senate. Laefer 
¦was previously a member of the Funding and 
ftecognition (F&R) committee and was elected Trea­
surer for the fall. Student Government had no 
Treasurer for many semesters before Laefer ex- 
pressedinterestintheposition.accordingto Shawn
¦ Knight, chair of the Public Relations and Human 
^Resources Committee.
- -Knight spoke highly of Laefer’s achievements. 
“Jay’s work... helped us manage what was already
a difficult situation with ---------------------------------
; the Activities Fee. He just 
went out of his way to get 
: information that other 
people wouldn’t have 
\ cared about,” said Knight,
; who said that Laefer was 
: one of very few people who 
i went into Senate records
and archives for informa- ----------------------------------
tion on previous funding 
problems.
Burt Holzman, chair of the Campus Affairs Com- 
' mittee, said that Laefer “defined the position,” 
setting a standard that had previously been un- 
' matched. “There had been trouble with Treasurers 
'• — competence problems. Senate thought it was
¦ better to have no Treasurer than a bad Treasurer,”
¦ said Holzman of the situation before Laefer.
Laefer had mixed feelings about his efforts as 
Treasurer. He said, “I think the work I did was both
very împor- 
tantand incon­
sequential at 
the same time.
I feel that in 
some ways I 
left a very per­
manent mark 
on Student 
Government, 
and that, in 
other ways,
had no lasting -----effect Tartan File Photo

cal conservatism in a way that most Senators don’t. 
Most people, when looking at proposed allocations, 
don’t really apply the Fiscal Policy to see if it’s a 
legitimate expenditure. And those that do believe 
that Fiscal Policy is the only necessary litmus 
test.”
Laefer expressed disappointment with the way 
allocations were passed, saying that Senators would 
pass them with a minimum of debate or scrutiny. 
“Consistently speaking out against allocations is 
virtually unheard of. I 
like to think that I was 
consistent, at any rate.... 
While I was in Student 
Government, the vast 
majority of Senators did 
not participate in de­
bate, and most any allo­
cation was passed,” said 
Laefer.
™Laefer is not optimis­
tic about a successor. “I think that some of the 
current Senators and organizational leaders will 
remember my attitudes about fiscal issues, but I 
think that no one will step in to fill my shoes as a 
voice of fiscal responsibility. Even if the office of 
Student Government Treasurer is filled, the role I 
played will probably remain open,” said Laefer.
As of yesterday, the position of Student Govern­
ment Treasurer is still open. Interested students 
should contact their Senator for information.
"/ set a precedent for 
fiscal conservatism in a 
way that most Senators 
don't."

managed to gain entrance to the 
offices without forcing their way 
in. “We don’t know how they ac­

was heading back to Melwood 
Avenue, which was in the direc­
tion opposite to that of her flight. 
The woman then requested a ride 
to her residence, which was pro­
vided.

to be completely dry and well lit.
1/14 ROBBERY, 10:50 pm. A 
student’s purse was stolen on 
Forbes Avenue by a man who 
reportedly had been loitering on

planetary exploration missions. 
Hä said that the Mt. Erebus ven- 
tul-e proved both pursuits worth­
while.
Philip Kyle of the New Mexico 
Institute of Mining and Technol­
ogy, another Mt. Erebus project 
investigator who spoke, pre­
sented the project from the 
volcanologist’s point of view.
“I think of [the Mt. Erebus ex- 
peHition] as one small step and 
expect we will be seeing robots 
exploringinside volcanoes around 
the world in a few years,” said 
Kjle.
Generally, the conference af-
firmed the success of the Mt. 
Erebus mission, according to 
Kyle, who termed the project as a 
“remarkable achievement.” 
Whittaker described the mission 
as a “bold leap,” in that it “pushed 
this technology from the labora­
tory into the real world.” Mean­
while, Lavery emphasized the 
“tremendous progress" attained 
by the year-long project.
This was not the first critical 
setback the Mt. Erebus project 
team encountered. In early No­
vember the date set to embark for 
Antarctica had to be postponed 
because of a failure in one of 
Dante’s welded joints.Housing official resigns

[aô he was working on] his disser­

Murphy said that O’Brien had 
made “prior commitments” to fin­

dedication by keeping [EMS] 
running. He was responsible 
for covering missed shifts and 
frequently went above and be­
yond the call of duty,” said Ser­
geant Bill Ricci.
“Ian played rugby for about a
year,” said George Lucier, 
rugby club president. “He was 
on top of his office; he was an 
aggressive player, and every­
one liked him.”
Gardner’s off-campus com­
mitments involved volunteer 
work for Wilkinsburg EMS. 
Prior to college, Gardner was 
the president of the youth group 
in his church.
“Our central concern,” said 
Murphy, “is making sure that 
anyone impacted by this is 
aware of the support available 
in the counseling center and by 
other friends. Without being 
intrusive, we want people to 
know that the staff here and in 
the residence areas is avail­
able throughout the upcoming 
weeks and months.”
Student Affairs is arranging 
a memorial service which is 
tentatively scheduled for this 
Thursday at 4:30 pm in the 
Adamson Wing.
Gardner is survived by his 
parents, three brothers, and a 
sister.

FORUM
Resources always exist for support
At times, in the high-pressure, 
wiork-hard, grin-and-bear-it 
wprld of CMU, it can feel like 
there is nowhere to turn, no one 
wjho will listen or who even cares 
What we are going through. The 
world feels like it is caving in, 
a$d all that anyone can see is 
the grade on the next project or 
tqst; sometimes all that we can 
remember is the last fight with 
our parents or with the person 
we care most about. In the grand 
soheme of things, a grade or a 
misunderstanding with a loved 
one can seem minor. But added 
to| all the other pressures of just 
being, it can be enough to make 
sqmeone feel like nothing is 
worth getting out of bed, much 
leps getting through the day or 
thle rest of his or her life.
ost of the time, feeling down 
gdes away when we get through 
the most recent problem. Ev­
eryone has mood swings, peri­
ods of feeling very up or very 
dc|wn. All of this is normal, and 
nothing to worry about. But 
wjien we hit a point when it 
feels like nothing is ever going 
to; be right again, it could be 
tiAae to look for some help in 
•getting away from the low 
pdints.
Talking to a friend is one way 
of; working out problems. Hav­
ing someone who will listen to 
yo.u can often make a situation 
mbre tolerable. If you feel that 
talking to a friend is for some 
reason not possible, there are a 
number of people and resources 
oil campus that are willing avail­
able to help.
There is absolutely nothing 
negative about calling or going 
into the Counseling Center, lo­
cated on the first floor of 
Morewood E-tower, across from 
Health Services. Human beings 
rely on one another for support 
and understanding, and there is 
nothing wrong with asking 
someone to listen. By calling 
x2922 anytime, day, night, or 
weekend, it is possible to reach a 
professional counselor. If con­
tacting the Counseling Center 
is uncomfortable, people in Stu­
dent Affairs (x2075), Housing 
(x2139), or Security (x2323) are 
available. Resident assistants in 
University Housing are also re­
sources. If talking to the RA on 
your floor is uncomfortable, con­
tacting an RA on a different floor, 
or even in a different dormitory, 
is an option.
It doesn’t matter who we talk 
to. It only matters that we go to 
someone with whom we are com­
fortable, and that we don’t keep 
the problems locked up inside of 
us. Sharing our concerns can 
make them a little less over­
whelming and might give us a 
new perspective on the prob­
lem.
By talcing each other’s pain 
and problems seriously, we can 
build a network of support and 
trust that might save someone 
from the loneliness and despair 
that can lead to the irrevocable 
decision of suicide. Asking for 
help — and responding to that 
request in a serious and caring 
manner—is not a sign of weak­
ness, but of strength.
Budget changes may 
increase efficiency
Student Senate Chair Greg 
Haverkamp and Funding and 
Recognition Committee (F&R) 
Chair Dave Martin have an- 
ndunced a plan to change most 
Senate-funded organizations to 
spring budgets. This means that 
most budget allocations would 
be{ made in the spring. This is a 
welcome move. Currently, some 
allocations are made in the fall. 
The new budgeting system 
should make the process more 
equitable to all organizations 
by allowing Senate to consider 
m6st organizations’ budget re­
quests at the same time. It will 
also assure that when retroac­
tive budget cuts are necessary, 
they can be more fairly executed.
With F&R planning to have 
nearly all groups’ budget hear­
ings occur over three different 
days, the process needs to be 
irripeccably organized. F&R 
should clearly and publicly state 
th|3 day on which each group 
will be heard, and stick to its 
decision. Each organization 
should receive a letter telling it 
which day it is to appear at the 
hejarings. The letter should be 
sent well in advance of the sched­
uled hearings, preferably giv­
ing at least three weeks notice.
A- major problem with the ap­
proval of budgets of Senate- 
funded groups is that the total 
amount of the Activities Fee is 
not known until well into the 
fall semester. Spring budgets, 
however, are already approved

far in advance of knowing the 
the actual income from the Ac­
tivities Fee. Moving all of the 
budgets to spring will require 
conservative budgeting to pro­
tect against overspending. Even 
with careful consideration of 
budgets there will still be a large 
amount of estimation involved 
in determining if the budgeted 
amounts will be within Senate’s 
means. Senate must weigh bud­
get requests against educated 
estimates of its income.
Senate should have a proce­
dure in place to deal with a bud­
get shortfall. Retroactive cuts 
should be equal percentages 
applied to subsidies, not total 
organizational budgets.
Further, Senate should desig­
nate a certain amount of the 
total budget for special alloca­
tions. If Senate needs to make 
cuts, a percentage of the special 
allocations money could be fun- 
neled into organizational bud­
gets instead of malting cuts. If 
the allowed percentage does not 
generate enough income, then 
subsidies would have to be cut.
The move to a new budgeting 
system should make funding for 
all groups more fair. Senate must 
be careful in the allocations of 
funds to avert any financial prob­
lems later. Organizations should 
carefully read the information 
that Senate supplies and follow 
all instructions to enable the 
process to run as quickly and 
smoothly as possible.
Editor:
As Publicity Coordi­
nator for The Danc­
ers’ Symposium, I sub­
mitted a letter to The 
Tartan on November 
9 detailing the information concerning 
our Fall performance on Novermber 20, 
21 and 22, and requested that the infor­
mation appear in your calendar of events 
in the next issue. Because I have had 
previous experiences with hand-deliv­
ered letters being misplaced, I took the 
letter to your mailbox at the Skibo Infor­
mation Desk. Much to Dancers’ 
Symposium’s shock and surprise, when 
The Tartan was published the following 
Monday (November 16) the information 
concerning our show had been omitted 
from your calendar of events for the 
week/weekend. As you well know, The 
Tartan reaches a large and diverse audi­
ence. We rely on your paper as our most 
effective means of advertisement.
We had a relatively good turn out for 
our three shows, but it’s impossible to 
know how many more people might have 
attended if they had read about it in The 
Tartan. However, we thought you would 
at least pay us the respect (the respect 
you pay to every other student group on 
this campus) to cover our event in the 
following issue of The Tartan, pub­
lished on November 21. There was ab­
solutely no review or even so much as a 
mention of our performance. We were 
shocked and appalled. You managed to 
have someone cover the Scotch ‘n’ Soda 
show, going on at the same time as ours, 
but failed to have someone cover our 
show (or deemed it not important or 
worthy enough to receive coverage in 
your paper). I don’t want to spend my 
time second guessing your motives. Per­
haps it was merely an oversight. But if 
so, we take it as quite an insulting over­
sight to be forgotten two weeks in a row.
The Tartan is a student-run organiza­
tion — surely you realize the time, work, 
and effort that goes into our organiza­
tion. To be ignored by one of the largest 
and most powerful organizations on cam­
pus must surely be perceived by them as 
a setback.

Student encourages 
working for King's dream
Editor:
Every third Monday 
in the month of Janu­
ary, the entire nation 
celebrates the birth­
day of the late Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. For many, 
King has come to embody those princi­
pals of fairness, unity, and justice that 
were the defining tenets of the Civil 
Rights struggle of the Sixties. King’s 
dedication and sacrifice have assumed 
legendary proportions, and his position 
in American history is unchallenged.
However, while many of King’s accom­
plishments have been celebrated in the 
25 years since his passing, little has 
been done to realize his ideas. We have 
not yet learned to live together, and his 
dream has yet to be fulfilled. Indeed, 
King’s vision is almost a cruel and twisted 
paradox, given mankind’s scientific and 
technological advances. Global tensions 
still abound. Great numbers of the 
world’s children still go hungry. Condi­
tions within inner-city America have 
steadily deteriorated. As Bosnia, Soma­
lia, and Los Angeles have recently evi­
denced, those three great scourges of 
humanity — war, poverty, and racism
— are far less past evils than present- 
day realities. In fact, many would ven­
ture that the world has become an in­
creasingly dangerous and unstable place.
In his address to the Nobel Peace Prize 
Committee in 1964, King used the op­
portunity to confront what he termed as 
“mankind’s moral and spiritual lag. De­
spite spectacular strides in science and 
“technology,” he felt mankind lacked a 
very basic and very fundamental love 
for itself. He believed that the solution 
to this problem lay in “squaring [man’s] 
moral progress with his scientific 
progress, and learning the practical art 
of living in harmony.” By focusing on the 
collective nature of mankind, King envi­
sioned a world in which all men and 
women would be able to live together as 
brothers and sisters. This, however, 
would require an active effort on the 
part of humanity.
The timelessness of this message 
makes it especially relevant today. Our 
survival as a race hinges upon our abil­
ity to learn to put aside our differences 
and make an effort to eliminate those
scourges King spoke so passionately of. 
If each of us focused on working to real­
ize his vision instead of merely celebrat­
ing it, perhaps King’s dream would bear 
greater fruit. This is our most pressing 
challenge, and the greatest tribute we 
could ever pay King.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
On behalf of the 
Brothers and Associ­
ates of Theta Xi, I 
would like to offer sin- 
cerest thanks to the 
University, particularly the Office of 
Student Affairs and the Counseling Cen­
ter, for their compassion and generosity 
regarding the recent loss of our friend 
and associate brother, Ian Gardner. Dean 
Michael Murphy personally telephoned 
our president and many members who 
were closest to Ian, including myself, 
Ian’s “Big Brother.” Furthermore, he 
saw to it that arrangements were made 
for me to accompany him to Ian’s funeral 
in his home town — a gesture which 
meant a great deal to Ian’s family, my­
self, and the entire Brotherhood.
The Counseling Center sent counse­
lors to the House to meet with the Broth­
ers and help us deal with our loss. I am 
aware the Center has also been involved 
with the students who lived on Ian’s 
floor for the past two years and with 
other campus organizations of which he 
was a part.
It is not often we laud a positive ac­
tion by the University compared with 
the many occasions on which we com­
plain about some negative action. Dean 
Murphy and the Counseling Center have 
revealed to us a side of this school which 
makes me proud to be a part of it.
I am confident that I represent all of 
Ian’s friends in thanking those who have 
helped us and will continue to help us 
through this period of grief.

In December I attended a vigil for the 415 Palestinians 
deported by Israel, currently languishing in the “No-Man’s 
Land” between Israel and Lebanon. Despite labels of “terror­
ist,” the only proven fact about these people is that they are 
Palestinian and Muslim. At the vigil, Talal Hilal wept as he 
spoke about Abd Alaziz Rantisi, a friend who was deported. 
He and Abd roomed together in college and have known each 
other for years. He said that for Abd to be a “terrorist” was 
quite impossible.
Among the deportees are seven M.D.’s and 16 U.N. Relief 
and Works Agency employees, 14 of whom teach at U.N. 
schools. Eighty are university faculty, staff, and students, 
including the President of the Islamic University of Gaza and
several departmental deans. There are 14 engineers, 12 
scientists, and over 100 religious leaders. Many are middle- ] 
aged family men, but ages range from 16 to 62. All were 
deported without publicly-presented evidence, trial, or convic­
tion, because they were allegedly members of Hamas (the 
Islamic Resistance Movement).
The deportations were a collective punishment for the 
kidnapping and murder of one Israeli soldier. In a civilized 
country ruled by law, the police would investigate, find the 
murderers, and punish them. To collectively punish members 
of an ethnic group for the act of a few rogues is racist.
Hamas’ act was not random. In 1989, Israel kidnapped the 
spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. A quad- i 
riplegic, Yassin is being held in solitary confinement serving | 
a life sentence. Hamas militants kidnapped the soldier to ¦ 
obtain Yassin’s release. While kidnapping and murder cannot j 
be condoned, neither can the kidnapping and torture of 
Yassin!
Imagine the outrage in the U.S. if 400 Native Americans < 
were deported to Mexico after a rebellious independence

Transition equals business as usual
Christian M. Restifo
What do a computer, the Sony 
Corporation, and two Peruvian 
aliens all have in common? That’s 
an absurd question, and the an­
swer is even worse. Naturally, 
it’s Washington. Yes, in the past 
week it’s been business as usual.
It seems as though the outgo­
ing Bush administration may 
erase computer files in violation 
of a judge’s order. According to 
The New York Times, Ralph 
Nader’s group, Public Citizen, 
filed a lawsuit saying that files in 
the computer systems used at the 
White House must be preserved. 
Some files must also be released. 
Charles R. Richey, a federal judge, 
decided that the files are pro­
tected by the Federal Records Act 
and may not be destroyed unless 
they have been reviewed.
After this ruling, the current 
administration attempted to 
erase the files by filing papers 
askingfor a stay. Richey also said 
the papers stated that the ad­
ministration planned to start 
erasing files on Friday to “make 
room” for the incoming Clinton 
administration. The reasoning is 
that if files aren’t erased, the com­
puters will “overload and shut 
down.” Of course, the judge only 
wants electronic messages and 
backup tapes to be saved.
Why, then, is the administra-
tion making such a big deal out of 
this whole thing? Why not just 
backup the material onto tapes 
or removable disks and then erase 
the files on the computers them­
selves? Why did officials “decline 
to comment” when contacted by 
The New York Times'! Why are 
they making such a big fuss over 
the thousands of essentially use­
less messages and files that set 
up lunch dates and contain mun­
dane information?
Well, in that sea of recorded 
material may be information 
about the Iran-Contra affair. 
There may also exist data about 
possible loans given to Iraq be­
fore its invasion of Kuwait. Does 
anyone out there remember the 
secretary who “accidentally” 
erased portions of tapes that had 
potentially incriminating conver- 
sations with then-President 
Nixon?
Keep in mind that there is a big 
difference between writing over 
data files and simply erasing 
them. When you erase a file, typi­
cally the information is still in­
tact on the disk. The operating 
system merely views that disk 
space as “free.” You can use popu­
lar software packages to retrieve 
the data as long as no other data 
has been written over it. Writing 
over the files destroys the data 
completely. Popular software 
packages such as the Norton Utili­
ties include programs that actu­
ally fulfill Department ofDefense 
requirements for destruction of 
classified data.
If the data isn’t really that im-
portant, then, why doesn’t the 
administration just erase the 
files? Or why not let the incoming 
administration do the same? See­
ing as the Clinton campaign made 
use of email, I’m sure that they 
are knowledgeable enough to type 
“erase" at a DOS prompt.
Of course this whole issue 
points to the need for laws and 
policies concerning electronic 
communications and data. Such
When the “Friends of Ron 
Brown" party made the news, 
serious questions were raised 
about a man who had already 
lobbied for foreign companies and 
interests, including those ofHaiti. 
The $10,000-a-plate, invitation- 
only event was planned long be­
fore Brown was picked as 
Clinton’s nominee, but the deci­
sion to go through with it was, 
and remains, highly suspect. Al-
Well, in that sea of recorded material 
may be information about the Iran- 
Contra affair. There may also exist 
data about possible loans given to 
Iraq before its invasion of Kuwait.
materials should be considered 
official documents covered by 
laws that now prevent the illegal 
destruction of paper documents. 
Likewise, they should be pre­
served for the public and histori­
ans. Useless messages that state 
“I’m gonna be late to lunch” should 
be erased only after the useful 
ones that summarize important 
meetings are preserved.
In a somewhat related, al­
though less technical, vein, we 
find the current controversies 
concerning Commerce Secretary- 
nominee Ron Brown and Attor­
ney General-nominee Zoe Baird. 
President-elect Clinton earns 
both plus and minus marks for 
both situations.
though Brown did not come up 
with the event, he should have 
pressured the organizers to drop 
the party. Additionally, he should 
have said “thanks, but no thanks” 
to companies such as Sony who 
planned to send representatives.
Clinton took the right action 
when he phoned Brown and told 
him to put the brakes on the party. 
After all, some of the companies 
involved will soon have concerns 
coming before the Commerce 
Department. However, Clinton 
should have picked someone else 
for Commerce Secretary. Brown’s 
pledge to be free of special inter­
ests is about as believable as 
David Duke’s turn around from 
his racist beliefs.
Then we come upon the issue 
concerning Zoe Baird and her 
employment of two illegal Peru­
vian aliens as domestic holp. The 
important thing hero to remem­
ber is that as Attorney Genoral, 
Baird will oversee the Immigra­
tion and Naturalization Service. 
Several things are still unclear. 
For example, Baird said that she 
believed she was within the law 
when she filed for citizenship on 
behalf of the woman. She also 
said that she thought the appli­
cation implicitly included the 
woman’s husband.
Following advice from a law­
yer, Baird and her husband did 
not pay Social Security tax for 
the aliens, as required by law. 
What is highly dubious is the fact 
that she paid the back taxes this 
month. While she gets points for 
disclosing the information to 
Clinton and the FBI, the timing 
is less than ideal. Unless the FBI 
report shows that she acted in 
good faith, she’ll remain a less- 
than-desirable candidate for At­
torney General.
To be honest, I was perhaps a 
little naive in my belief that things 
might change by at least some 
small fraction because of the 
change in administrations. While 
there is much to look forward to 
in other areas, honest govern­
ment is obviously not one of them. 
Let’s just hope that Clinton does 
more ethics enforcement similar 
to his handling of Brown.

group killed an American soldier. Here, 
such an expulsion would be a clear viola­
tion of law and human rights.
Israel has been repeatedly censured for 
violations of the Geneva Convention for its 
treatment of Palestinians, but neverthe­
less Judge Landau of the Israeli Supreme 
Court authorized “moderate physical pres­
sure” during interrogations. Robert 
Kirschner,a Physicians for Human Rights 
board member, said “... the [Landau au­
thorization] ... represents] a subterfuge 
for officially sanctioned torture.”
Mamdouh A1 Aker, a Palestinian physi­
cian, was arrested without charge and 
held for five weeks. He was tortured with 
sleep deprivation. His head was placed in 
a bag, he was put in solitary, and confined 
for hours in a small lightless room he 
referred to as “the coffin,” a torture similar 
to Vietnamese tiger cages!
A more horrible case is that of Mustafa 
Akkawi, a 35-year-old Jerusalem resident, 
who died in prison of a torture-induced 
heart attack. Independent pathologist 
Michael Baden (from the New York City 
Police), said the heart attack was caused 
by “emotional pressure, physical exertion,
and freezing temperatures he was forced 
to withstand ... along with lack of proper 
medical care.”
Israeli General Security Service inter­
rogators freely admit Akkawi was hand­
cuffed, hooded, placed in a bitterly cold 
corridor for several hours, and beaten at
tainees there was “widespread and sys­
tematic use of torture.” The U.S. State 
Department Country Reports on Human 
Rights Practices for 1991 shows human 
rights abuses in the Occupied Territories 
are abundant. It mentions “credible re­
ports of torture, abuse, and mistreatment
Israeli General Security Service interrogators 
freely admit Akkawi was handcuffed, hooded, 
placed in a bitterly cold corridor for several 
hours, and beaten at least once.
least once. Akkawi’s judge wrote, just hours 
before his death, “...I saw bruises on his 
arms and shoulders. He complains of tor­
ture; I suspect in my heart that his com­
plaint is genuine.” Human Rights groups 
are charging Akkawi’s treatment violates 
the Convention Against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhumane or DegradingTreatment 
or Punishment, which Israel ratified in 
1991.
Amnesty International reported in 1990 
that in interrogations of the Intifada de-
of... detainees.” It exposes the excessive 
use of “administrative detention” without 
due process for periods of up to a year, 
which is renewablel In a nutshell: Pales­
tinians can be arrested without charge, 
imprisoned without trial or conviction, le­
gally tortured, and through renewals kept 
in prison indefinitely!
I perceive that Israel does not want 
peace but rather a solution to the “Pales­
tinian Problem.” Israeli actions are clearly 
intended to drive the Palestinians away
from peace talks by perpetrating out­
rages so extreme that for the Palestinians 
to stay at the table would be an accep­
tance of this brutality. If they don’t re­
turn, then Israel can claim the Palestin­
ians don’t really want peace, that there is 
nobody to talk with, and they can con­
tinue their annexation of the Occupied 
Territories unhindered.
Peace Now in Israel reports that Rabin 
has budgeted $1 billion for new Israeli 
settlements in the Occupied Territories, 
about the same as under Shamir — so 
much for any actions of good will towards 
a peaceful settlement. Our tax money is 
flowing, at over $3 billion a year, to fi­
nance this brutal example of 20th century 
colonialism.
Stop aid to Israel. Cancel the loan guar­
antees. This is the only way can we get 
Israel to be serious about making peace. 
The blood of Akkawi, among many oth­
ers, is on our hands. How many more 
must die?
David Hunt, a mechanical engineering 
graduate student, is appalled at the double 
standard the U.S. applies in its stance on 
human rights.
Just over two years ago, 
haq invaded Kuwait, and the 
U-N. countries (led by the 
US.) attacked Iraq. The Gulf 
War was quick and deci­
sive, but many people 
thought that the attacks 
should have gone farther.

Men’s basketball team cools off
Team drops pair of UAA contests, snapping seven-game winning streak
PRESS PASS
by Paul PlatoshBy GARY WILSON
Tartan Staffwriter
After getting off to the best start 
in the history of the program, the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s basket­
ball team had its seven game 
winning streak snapped Wednes­
day night at home, with an 80-70 
loss to New York University. 
According to coach Tony Wingen, 
“It’s not going to get any easier. 
Every game is a big game. There 
aren’t going to be any easy games 
from here on out.”
The Tartans found this out for 
sure, as the Violets of NYU came 
out storming in the first half. 
After opening the game on the 
usual drive to the hoop by junior 
Mike Hosni, the Tartans sacri­
ficed the next eight points and 
would never again possess the 
lead. Despite three first-half 
three pointers from senior co-cap­
tain Todd Jenkins, the Tartans 
finished the half down 45-32. 
This included a key play with 
only seconds left in the period 
whenNewYork’sAdam Crawford 
carried the ball through the team 
and put up a three point shot at 
the buzzer.
According to Tartan leading 
scorer, junior Charlie Connors, 
“We came out really flat. We 
started flat and carried flat. The 
last few minutes of the half were 
also really bad.”
The second half looked a bit 
more promising, as the scoring 
opened with a three-point bucket 
by junior Rony Johns. Following 
a countering two points by NYU,
the Tartans went on an eight- 
point tear and started a valiant 
comeback. Atl4:14, Johns pulled 
the team back within two. Four­
teen seconds later, New York’s 
Thomas Bowman went in all 
alone, or so he thought, only to be 
denied on a dramatic diving block 
by junior Derek Dragisich. Afoul 
was called and Bowman con­
verted on a free throw. This was 
as close as CMU would get to 
tying up the game. After scoring 
back and forth the the next 10 
minutes, New York began to pull 
away, ending the score at 80-70.
Senior co-captain Chris Benec 
said, “They’re a good team, but 
we feel we should beat every team. 
Everytime we got back in the 
game, one or two plays would kill 
us. We kept havingmentallapses. 
We have to play more solid.” 
Wingen commended his squad on 
their second half efforts, “We got 
off to a poor start and that was 
the difference in the game. I was 
proud of our guys that they came 
back in the second half.” 
Dragisich said, “We came out re­
ally sluggish and not really in­
tense. We made a good run in the 
second half, but it was just too big 
of a deficit.”
The team had hoped to recover 
from the loss and get back on 
track against Emory University 
on Saturday, but ended up in 
another tough situation. Emory 
jumped out to an early four-point 
lead. The Tartans kept it close 
before junior Matt Reiprish tied 
the score up at the 12:00 mark. 
The scoring bounced back and
forth for the next nine minutes. 
At 3:16, Jenkins took the ball 
coast to coast to knot the score up 
at 35. With 54 seconds left in the 
half, freshman Kevin Byrne hit a 
three-pointer to dose the half 37- 
34, in favor of CMU.
Despite the lead, the team’s 
free throw shooting proved to be 
a problem, knocking down only 
33 percent in the first half, while 
the Emory Eagles were a perfect 
six for six. This turned out to be 
the major difference in the game.
In the second half, CMU held 
on to a tight lead for the first few 
minutes. Atl4:08,Dragisich was 
given a technical foul, sending 
near-perfect foul shooter Kevin 
Felner to the line. Felner pulled 
his team within two and soon 
took the lead away from the Tar­
tans. At 6:13, Emory forward Nick 
Pastis tossed up three rebound 
shots before finally sinking one. 
Wingen called a timeout to get 
his team fired up. Despite a short 
offensive flurry, the Tartans were 
unable to get close enough, until 
it was too late. With one minute 
remaining, Emory lead 70-67. 
Baskets fell back and forth, until 
Reiprish closed the gap to 76-74 
with nine seconds left on the clock. 
The team put forth one last ef­
fort, but the Emory offense man­
aged to sink two more freethrows, 
ending the game at 78-74. The 
win lifted Emory to a 7-5 overall 
record, while Carnegie Mellon 
faltered to 9-3.
As it turned out, the second 
half was even worse for the Tar­
tan offense, sinking only 35 per-
(GnR,B 7,BpNBT ve4o ú,SnR a,oS GU 7,B sp, ,7 leS «22 ENBooB U,ensSt
cent from the field. The final froo 
throw count ended with Emory 
at 86 percent and CMU at 57 
percent. This difference was 
enough to hand the Tartans their 
second straight loss, and only 
third loss of the season.
According to Wingen, “Emory 
is much improved over last year. 
They got off to a pretty good start 
and come in on a three-game win­
ning streak.”
Despite the loss, the game fea­
tured two significant Tartan high­
lights. Jenkins, who has lead the 
team in assists for the last four
seasons, racked up his 400th ca­
reer assist late in the game. Also, 
with seven points on the night, 
Hosni reached his 800th caroer 
point. Jenkins led the Tartans in 
scoring against Emory, with 18 
points. Connors was the leading 
reboundor with eight boards.
Tho Tartans next home game 
is January 27, against Washing­
ton & Jefferson College, whom 
they defeated 66—64 in Novem­
ber.
This weekend, the team visits 
Washington University and the 
University of Chicago.
Women’s roundball splits league games with New York, Emory

On Saturday, the women’s basketball team suf­
fered an eye-opening defeat. Ateam that has known 
winning for a good amount of time, the 86-52 loss 
to Emory (8—2,3—1 UAA) was something that they 
do not want to see ever again.
As junior forward Jeanine Megahan said, “In a 
game, your offense can turn on and off, where your 
defense has to always be there. In this game, both 
weren’t there.” Megahan, who was limited to only 
nine points and eight from the-field, has never seen 
a loss like this in her entire life. “[Saturday’s] game 
never happened,” said senior forward Stephanie 
Grey. “It’s over. We’ll get Emory in late February.” 
The game began as a close match, with CMU up 
by as much as three points five minutes into the 
game. However, the Tartan’s shooting went down­
hill, eventually leading to a field goal percentage
under 40. However, with the continued excellent 
play of sophomore center Meridith McKnight (18 
points), the game was kept close in the early going. 
Senior guard Heather Bassett, who hasn’t played 
much this year, did well in tho game, gaining 10 
points, two assists, one rebound and one steal. 
Sophomore guard Christa Sober also made a nice 
three-point shot late in the first half.
The second half, however, is when the Tartans 
defense, in Megahan’s words, “wasn’t there.” Since 
the game against New York University was such 
an important victory, the team wasn’t prepared for 
Emory. Jenny Gretz, a sophomore guard/forward, 
gained 10 points in the second half, eight on field 
goals and two from the line. Emory’s second half 
field goal shooting was just too much for CMU, 
gaining 49 percent to the Tartans 25 percent.
The loss was a tough one for the team to swallow,

Swimmers roll towards UAA championships and nationals
Men sink Hiram, W&J; Women get first win of the season vs. Hiram
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
swim team continues its charge 
towards the UAA championships, 
posting wins over Hiram College, 
105-78, and Washington & 
Jefferson, 111-69, this week to 
run its record to 4—1 in dual meet 
competition.
Meanwhile, the women’s team 
picked up its first win of the sea­
son in Saturday’s meet against 
Hiram, squeaking out a 98-96 
victory to break a four-meet los­
ing streak, including a close 98— 
94 loss to Washington & Jefferson 
on Wednesday.
Against Hiram, freshman Geoff 
Waller won twice, taking the 200 
yard breaststroke, and setting a 
CMU pool record in the 400 yard 
individual medley with a time of 
4:21.23.
During the meet, fellow fresh­
man Becky Freuhan won the 100 
yard butterfly and the 50 yard 
freestyle, while sophomore 
Joanne Kleevan set a personal 
best time in winning the200yard 
backstroke in 2:36.42.
Sophomore Marci Sensich 
clinched the meet with her sec­
ond place in the 200 breaststroke 
(the next-to-last event).
Freuhan also set a pool record 
at Washington & Jefferson, win­
ning the 200 freestyle in 1:59 flat.
Coach Jim Cutrone’s young 
team, which only has eight se­
niors, has been working on its 
conditioning in anticipation ofthe 
UAA 
champion­
ships, Feb.
11-13.
“The

before the 
meet [Sat-

Cutrone 
said.
“The

about 
2,000 
yards.
“Down in Florida, we were we’re swimming well,” he said, 
swimming 12,000 yards every “We’re going to work hard for two 
day. We even swam some off- more weeks, then start to rest up 
events [in Saturday’s meet], since for championships.
we need to see people swim dif­
ferent events.
“I call it taking care of busi­
ness.
'I am more concerned with the 
UAA and national meets than 
any dual meets.”
Prior to winter vacation, the 
We’re swimming tired, but team lost a meet at JohnsHopkins
University 
on December 
4-5, before 
departing 
for warmer 
climates.
“We were 
very tired,” 
Cutrone 
said, “since 
the meet was 
right before 
final exams. 
We basically 
got beat up. 
The team 
used it as a

Fame during the break, from De­
cember 28-January 11, swimming 
23 workouts (twice a day). The 
team also spent a day snorkeling, 
and another day sightseeing.
The team got the added advan­
tage ofusing the facility’s 50 meter, 
nine lane pool, instead of CMU’s 
25 yard, five lane pool.
At the UAA championships, 
swimmers are allowed to swim in 
seven different events (of the 20 
events), instead of the three they 
are allowed to swim in dual meets 
(of the 12 events).
Cutrone said the men’s team, 
fourth a year ago, is looking for a 
second place' finish, and should 
contend Btrongly.
Meanwhile, the women’s team, 
seventh in 1992, is hoping to gain 
one or two spots in the standings.
The team closes out the dual 
meet season with a pair of Satur­
day matchups.
On Saturday, the squad travels 
to Bethany College in a non-league 
meet.
The following Saturday, the 
Bwimmers take on Slippery Rock 
University to finish the regular 
season, hosting the Rockets in a 
contest beginning at 1 p.m.

Hockey club skates 
into contention
By PAUL PLATOSH
Tartan Staffwriter
It was the start of the third period, and the Bcore was 5-3. 
The Carnegie Mellon hockey team needed what amounted to a 
miracle on ice to win the game. But the team was ready, willing, 
and determined to do just that. With a little luck and a few costly 
penalties on the part of Indiana University of Pennsylvania 
(IUP), the Tartans were able score three goals to rob the win from 
IUP.
That kind of determination seems to have follow the team 
onto the ice wherever they have played in the first part of the 
season. “[This team] really shows a don’t quit attitude. People 
really want to win,” defenseman Tom Sullivan said. That atti­
tude has become an integral part ofthe team, andhas allowed the 
players to continue playing hockey “Tartan style”, no matter how 
great the adversity. “[The players] aren’t giving up late in the 
game. It’s great,” Sullivan said.
And that becomes apparent with a quick glance at the 
statistics. With a record of 5-1-0, the Tartans are tied with West 
Virginia for second place in the WeBtem Pennsylvania College 
Hockey Association (WPCHA). IUP leads the division with 11 
points, one point ahead of CMU and West Virginia. The powerful 
scoring line of freshmen Greg Hans and Roger Maddalena and 
graduate student Dave Umland netted 25 lamplighters in 7 
games, while the solid checking of fifth-year senior George 
Mueller and graduate student Dave Collins effectively shut 
down some of the league’s best players. Senior Jan-Mare 
Featherston and sophomore Gregg Jessop formed a solid defen­
sive wall that demonstrated outstanding defensive awareness at 
the blue line. Goaltending came in the form of graduate student 
Scott Berry, a wiry netminder who has posted a respectable .895 
save percentage. “He’s fantastic. He’s kept us in a lot of these 
games,” Sullivan said.
The team has a few new faces this year, but the core group of 
players has remained the same. The players have begun to know 
each others styles, and have begun to come together as a close- 
knit team. ‘We are getting there. The first couple of games are 
always rough, but the players that came in are big scorers, and 
they just dropped right in,” Sullivan said.
But the team has had its share of adversity as well. Hans, the 
team’s leading scorer with 21 points, transferred to the Univer­
sity of Massachusetts. Injuries to Featherston, out for the season 
with a broken wrist, and Jessop, who missed time with a broken 
thumb, have created some problems in the backline. It is still 
unclear whether or not Jessop will return to the lineup for the 
remainder of the season. “The other players stepped in and 
picked it up, and we still only let up twenty goals in the six games 
that we played, so we’re pretty happy with that,” Sullivan said.
And this semester, the team wants to win the championship 
for the second year in a row. "We want to go for it all the way. We 
think it will be between us, West Virginia, and Indiana,” Sullivan 
said. Now, the team wants to win the division in order to secure 
a first place playoff berth which would allow them to play the 
fourth place team. “We’d rather have IUP play West Virginia, 
rather than us having to go through both of them, but whatever 
happens, we’re ready to go for it,” Sullivan said.
The hockey team is different from other CMU sports in that 
it maintains a club status, and is coached by players — Dave 
Collins and graduate student Scott Sarbacker. That is some­
thing that the players pride themselves on because every win 
that thoy get is a direct reflection on their effort, and with only 
one loss so far, that’s a lot of effort. “We like the fact that we’re 
coached by players. We're in charge of our own situation,” 
Sullivan said.
One change that the hockey team would like to see is some 
more support from the school and the student body. Plans for 
getting transportation to and from the rink are under way, but 
for now, car pool rides are sometimes offerred to hockey fans on 
the hockey b-board. Though the Tartans, love playing the game, 
a win is much sweeter when the fans are there to see it..
The CMU Hockey Team will play an exhibition game Friday 
January 22 against Duquesne at Belmont.

College with the Icebreaker Invi­
tational. Head coaches Gary 
Meckley and Dario Donatelli both 
share a ‘wait and see attitude’ 
with this season’s team. “This is 
a very young team. At least half 
the team are freshman or first 
year runners. We don’t have 
depth in sprinting, hurdles, and 
throwing events”, said Donatelli. 
“It is very hard to make any pre­
season evaluation,” saidMeckley.
Donatelli has high expectations 
of juniors Aliza Hildebrand in the 
3000-5000 meters and Ersula 
Cosby who is the school record 
holder in the triple jump, and 
freshman Missy Baustert (400- 
800 meters, hurdles).
The men’s half is not as strong 
in the distance events as in years 
past. Their 4x400 relay team is 
very good. The distance runners 
to watch for are seniors Scott 
Phillips and Rich Hays, juniors 
Jim Langer, Jarrod Siket, sopho­
more Sean McDowell, and fresh­
man Mike Ray and Scott Moore. 
Senior Chris Maguire returns 
for the sprinting events, and 
sophomores Brandon Woodard 
(jumping events) and Darren 
Haley (hurdles). Returning for 
the throwing events are seniors 
Bob Bruce, Jim Hodges, and 
Jason Lange who holds the dis­
cus school record, sophomores 
Kevin Keir and Jason Gruskey 
(who holds the school record in 
the shotput), and freshman E. J. 
Tsangaris.
Regardless of the amount of 
talented athletes the indoor
track team has, they will be at 
disadvantage. The lack of an in. 
door track forces the team to prac. 
tice. two evenings a week at the 
University of Pittsburgh. This does 
not allow them enough training 
sessions to work on their tech. 
nique. Most teams they will com- 
pete against have indoor facili- 
ties. The lack of facilities not only 
hurts the current team, it hurts 
every person on campus who en. 
joys running but doesn’t want 
run outdoors in the winter cold. It 
hurts recruitment efforts by the 
track team, thereby hurting fu. 
ture track teams.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 18 January 199313
By GARY WILSON
,Tartan Staffwriter
“I’m real pleased with our start, 
for the most part our perfor­
mance has been very consistent.” 
-That’s what men’s basketball 
head coach, Tony Wingen, had to 
say about the Tartans outstand­
ing start this season. With a 9-1 
, record, the team got off to its best 
start in the history of the pro- 
gram, which includes a big 7game 
winning streak.
According to junior forward 
"Charlie Connors, “So far, so good. 
We basically have beaten the 
teams we’re supposed to beat. 
We’re now getting into the meat 
of our conference schedule. This 
season is far from over.” Connors 
leads the team in most offensive 
categories, includingscoring(16.5 
points-per-game), shooting per­
centage ( 58 percent) and re­
bounding (8.8 rebounds-per- 
game).
There have been many contrib­
uting factors to the team’s dra­
matic success early on. They are 
ranked in the top-20 nationally 
in defensive points allowed and 
defensive shooting percentage. 
They have played rather consis­
tently and have also been a scor­
ing machine at times.
According to Coach Wingen, 
We’ve had a real balanced at­
tack. We really haven’t had to 
rely on any one or two players all
season. Different guys are scor­
ing every game. It makes us hard 
to defend against.” In addition to 
Connors, both Derek Dragisich 
and Rony Johns are averaging 
over 10 points a game. Junior 
Mike Hosni is not far behind at 
9.5. Chris Benee, Matt Reiprish 
andTodd Jenkins have also added 
a great deal of strength to the 
attack.
While the balanced offense has 
been important, some feel it has 
been the defense that has pow­
ered this team’s success. “We’re 
playing a lot better team defen­
sively,” commented junior for­
ward Derek Dragisich. Connors 
added, “Our defense has done a 
great job. We’ve held opponents 
to under 75 points almost every 
game.”
Another key factor to this 
team’s success has been experi­
ence. According to Dragisich, 
“We’ve been playing together for 
almost three years now.” Co­
captain Chris Benec feels the 
same. - “We’re more experienced 
through all the tough losses over 
the past two years. We now know 
what’s expected and what it takes. 
Experience is the key.”
Although the team has excelled 
inmany areas, there are still some 
aspects in which they need to 
work on in order to continue win­
ning ballgames. Dragisich com­
mented, “We need to have more 
consistency. Sometimes, we start
out really bad and get ourselves 
in a hole, or we’ll start out well 
and then let down. We need to be 
more solid.” Coach Wingen has 
been fairly pleased with most of 
the team’s play, but feels they 
need to work harder under the 
net. “Our outside shooting has 
come around and our turnovers 
are down, but rebounding contin- 
uestobeaproblem. Wearedoing 
better than last year, but there’s 
always room for improvement.” 
With such an excellent start, 
everyone seems optimistic in look­
ing at the rest of the season. So 
just how far can this Tartan team 
go? - “We will go as far as we want 
to,” stated Benec, “As long as we 
play smart, we’ll be fine. I don’t 
see any teams that we can’t beat. 
There isn’t a game that we 
shouldn’t win.” According to 
Dragisich, “The toughest part of 
the schedule lies ahead, but we 
do have a chance to win the UAA 
and make the national tourna­
ment.’’ Connors shares this out­
look, “We have a really good shot 
to win the UAA, and possibly win 
20 games.”
A final contributing factor to 
the success of the team, accord-t 
ing to Benec, is the increased fan 
support. “The fan support has 
been great. We’re fun to watch 
play, and it’s great to play in front 
of more people.” If fan support 
keeps up and the team’s success 
is here to stay, the Tartans could

but they will come back, and come back strong. “We 
i as a team, we lose as a team,” explained 
“Megahan.
“NYU was a big win. We can still come back 
against Washington U. and Chicago this week, and 
still make the tournament. Last year, we lost a lot 
of important games late in the season — at least 
the losses [this year] weren’t as important.”
She said that the early achievements that she 
has made are over, and she’d be happier with a 
better record.
With the excellent talent and strong team atmo­
sphere, there is no doubt that they will gain many 
more wins.
The Tartans battle Grove City College tonight at 
6 p.m., and then continue their road trip, heading 
west to St. Louis to face the Bears of Washington 
University in a key UAA matchup.
The team continues to travel, heading to the 
University of Chicago to take on the Maroons in yet 
another league contest.
The road trip concludes the following weekend, 
when they travel to Rochester on January 29 and 
Brandeis on the January 31.

After an early-season three 
game losing streak, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens basketball team 
heated up over the winter break, 
running its record to 6-4 overall 
and 2-1 in the UAA.
In the Carnegie Mellon Thanks­
giving Classic, the women 
dropped two games. In the first, a 
match against Waynesburg, the 
Lady Tartans lost by a mark of 
71-60. In the game, sophomore 
Meridith McKnight led the team 
with 18 points, while 
juniorJeanine Megahan had 13 
and junior Mary Moore had 10 
points and 11 rebounds. In the 
second game, a consolation 
match, they lost by a 52-48mark. 
Megahan, in the middle of an 
outstanding season, lead the 
squad with 16 points, while Moore 
had 13. Sophomore Christa So­
ber led the team on the other end 
of the court with 11 rebounds. In
tho tournament, captain Kelly 
Sterling was named to the all­
tourney team.
On December 1, the Tartans 
fell to the Washington & Jefferson 
Presidents by a margin of 72-61, 
lowering their record to 2-4. 
Megahan once again led the team 
with 21 points, with Moore and 
Gretz having 14 and 11, respec­
tively.
The turnaround began with the 
games against the University of 
Chicago and Johns Hopkins Uni­
versity. On December 4, against 
Chicago, the women won by a 60- 
56 score. McKnight had 22 points 
and pulled down 12 rebounds, 
while Megahan had 41 combined 
points (22 against Chicago and
19 against Johns Hopkins) to fol­
low up her 21 point performance 
against W&J. In the 68-61 win 
against JHU, Sterling and sopho­
more Jenny Gretz had 13 while 
Moore followed with 10 points 
and 13 boards. Their record stood 
at 4—4 (2-1 in the UAA) before
the break.
For her performance, Megahan 
was named the UAA Player of 
the Week for the Becond time on 
December 7. Her 62 points, 24 
rebounds, 13 assists, nine steals, 
20.7 ppg, 56% field goal percent­
age, and 70% free throw percent­
age paved the way for her being 
named with the honor. This sea­
son, she has eclipsed many other 
players in leading the Tartans.
After they returned from the 
three week break, the women 
were rejuvinated, gaining two 
victories at Haverford College in 
their first weekend back. Against 
Haverford, the team won by a 
score of 65-44, with McKnight’s 
18 points and 10 rebounds lead- 
ing the way. Megahan, once again 
proving to be a force, followed 
with 13 points. In the 73-59 vic­
tory against Davidson College, 
McKnight had 20 points and 13 
rebounds, while Megahan had 15. 
The two games rose their record 
to 6-4.

Penguins’ Lemieux diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Disease
By lubomir kochanskyj
Tartan Sports Editor 
& ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Pittsburgh Penguins’ All-Star center Mario 
Lemieux has been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Dis­
ease, a form of lymphatic cancer.
Lemieux was diagnosed with an early stage of the 
Nodular Lymphocytic form, which offers the most 
favorable chance for recovery, especially when diag­
nosed in an early stage.
Dallas and Buffalo will try to lay ghosts to rest in Super Bowl
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
In 1989, the Dallas Cowboys 
'began a new stage in team his­
tory under the combination of 
Owner/General Manager Jerry 
Jones and Head Coach Jimmy 
Johnson, former roommates at 
'the University of Arkansas.
Jones bought the team from a 
¡group led by H.R. “Bum” Bright, 
and promptly cleaned house — 
¦firing G.M. Tex Schramm and 
legendary Head Coach Tom 
;Landry.
Opponents promptly cleaned 
house on the Cowboys, who went 
1-15 during the season.
Despite criticism from all sides 
for his handling of the Cowboys, 
in particular the firing of Landry, 
Jones vowed the team would turn 
around, and return to its glory 
days ofthe 1970’s, a decade which 
saw the team an almost peren­
nial Super Bowl contender.
Sunday, the comeback of 
'America’s Team” came within 
one step of completion. With Dal­
las’ 30-20 thrashing of San Fran­
cisco, the best team in the Na­
tional Football League during the 
regular season, the Cowboys re­
turned to the Super Bowl for the 
'first time since 1979, when they 
fell to the Steelers, 35-31 in Su­
pper Bowl XIII.
The new wave Cowboys, led by 
quarterback Troy Aikman, the 
Jones/Johnson era’s first player 
(he was the first overall pick in 
the 1989 draft, the first overseen 
by Jones), running back Emmitt 
Smith, the main acquisition of 
the famous Herschel Walker 
trade, and wide receiver Michael 
Irvin, one of the last ties to the old 
regime (the first round pick in 
1988) now have their first chance 
to earn a place in football lore, 
joining names like Roger 
Staubach and Drew Pearson in 
Super Bowl history.
Meanwhile, Johnson, the coach,
could be the first man to coach a 
National Collegiate Athletic As­
sociation champion (the Univer­
sity of Miami, 1987), and a Super 
Bowl champion.
The Cowboys’ opponents, on the 
otherhand, are not newcomers to 
the Super Sunday scene, but 
rather, old hands hoping “the 
third time’s a charm.”
The Buffalo Bills, with quar­
terback Jim Kelly returning from 
a knee injury that sidelined him 
through the team’s first two play­
off games, defeated the Miami 
Dolphins, 29-10, to get one more
— some football analysts say one 
last — chance at the big prize.
In 1990, the Bills cruised 
through the regular season and 
the playoffs, only to see their 
dreams sail wide right on the foot 
of kicker Scott Norwood on Super 
Bowl Sunday, 1991.
They got a chance for redemp­
tion in January of 1992, but lost 
again, pummelled by Mark 
Rypien and the Washington 
Redskins.
Now they have a new kicker, 
former Tampa Bay Buccaneer 
Steve Christie, as they return to 
the big game. This time, how­
ever, the pressure will not be on 
the Bills, now the three time 
American Football Conference 
champions, but on the newcom­
ers, the Cowboys.
For Kelly, running back 
Thurman Thomas, wide receiver 
Andre Reed, linebackers 
Cornelius Bennet and Shane 
Conlan, defensive end Bruce 
Smith and a host of other aging 
All-Pros and household names, 
this game may be their final 
chance to bring the Vince 
Lombardi Trophy to upstate New 
York.
For the Cowboys of Jones, 
Johnson, Aikman, Smith, Irvin 
and a host of young unknowns, 
this is opening night, the first 
chance in the spotlight.
The future ahead is bright, and
the beginning of the future could 
be January 31.
For two weeks, the veteran Bills 
and the youthful Cowboys must 
now deal with the hype and the 
pressure ofthe media, the public, 
and the world.
For the Bills, the question is 
“Can you do it this time?,” and for 
the Cowboys, the question is “Is 
now the time?”
Neither team was expected to 
make it to center stage, but as 
Pete Rozelle used to say, “on any 
given Sunday anyteam can win...” 
So while Dan Marino and Steve 
Young sit at home, along with 
Bill Cowher, Dennis Green and 
Randall Cunningham and so 
many others who were 1992’s 
headlines, two teams of “has- 
beens” and “never-weres” will 
take the field on the last day of 
January, with football immortal­
ity at stake.
Over the next two weeks, and 
possibly the two weeks after that, 
fans will be able to read countless 
articles and features about ev­
erything from racial tension (the 
Super Bowl was to be held in 
Phoenix this year, but was moved 
to Los Angeles, sight of last year’s 
horrible riots, because Arizona 
refused to adopt a Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Day holiday) to what 
kind of underwear Dallas backup 
Steve Beuerlein wears.
There will be a million articles 
about what has been and what 
will be; a million more about what 
should have been; and ten times 
that about the game itself.
But come January 31, none of 
the press clippings, none of the 
human interest, none of the tele­
vision revenue, none of the legal 
troubles, none of that will mat­
ter. All that will matter is two 
teams — about 100 players, 20 
coaches, and a half dozen admin­
istrators — who take the field in 
the biggest game of the year.
Welcome to 1993, N.F.L. style. 
Happy New Year.

The diagnosis was made after an enlarged 
lymph node was removed from his neck. The 
disease was only present in the abnormal lymph 
node.
Subsequent tests have shown no evidence of 
any other medical problems.
Further treatment, radiation therapy over a 
one month period, has been recommended by 
doctors.
The chance of curing the disease is over 90 
percent. Reports say Lemieux is expected to re­
turn to the lineup in approximately 4-6 weeks.

Lookin'

by LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Staffwriter
In a $10,000 effort this weekend, 
Student Affairs sponsored the first 
annual Reorientation program for 
freshmen. Unlike the fall orientation, 
Reorientation was designed to take 
on a more academic perspective to 
provide greater insight into the col­
lege scene after the fall semester. 
Through a combination of careful 
planning, concerned faculty and ea­
ger students, an exciting program 
unfolded.
The planners began their work last 
September after a faculty meeting 
with President Mehrabian. “Our goal 
was to build on the foundation of the 
fall orientation but focus more on 
academic components such as study 
skills and other academic support is­
sues,” says Tim Foster, reorientation 
coordinator.
The sponsors felt an academic pro­
gram would be more helpful if pre­
sented sometime after the first se­
mester. “Freshmen are already faced 
with many new issues when they ar­
rive at college: roommates, making 
friends...socialissues. Having the aca­
demic stresses as well can be a pretty 
heavy load,” says Foster.
To assure they could provide the 
necessary services, the sponsors spoke 
with each Associate Dean from all of 
the colleges and discussed the collec­
tive weaknesses of their students and 
likewise, what programs could be
implemented to meet these shortcom- faculty was also formed to help those 
ings. The workshops were designed students who needed to recover from 
to allow the - 
students to 
personally 
choose and 
plan the 1 
schedule of 
their 
choice.
Workshops

by BOB DIXON
Tartan Staffwriter
“There are two things I wanted 
to do at CMU,” said CIT Fresh- 
[ man Paul Hrynko. “I wanted to 
be a tourguide and I wanted to be 
I M RA” Hrynko is currently a 
tourguide for the Carnegie Mellon 
: Office of Admissions and is in the 
i process of trying to realize his 
second goal of becoming a resi­
dent assistant.
So why has Paul Hrynko de­
cided that he wants to be an RA? 
“It’s completely not the fact that 
: you get your own room,” he said. 
Hrynko wants to show students 
living on campus that “Carnegie 
Mellon can be a lot of fan and not 
; non-stop stress.”
For Hrynko, the desire to help 
his fellow students find alterna­
tive perspectives to the “non-stop 
stress” of CMU will be one of the 
qualities sought after by the 
Housing Office Area Coordina- 
| tors interviewing prospective 
resident assistants.
“Wanting to assist people is one 
°f the major things [we’re looking 
f°r],” said Amy Ginther, Assis­
tant Director of Housing for Resi­
dence Life. The resident assis­
tant Job Description also lists 
desirable resident assistants as 
those who “are able to view issues 
from different perspectives; are 
°pen to diversity and different 
lifestyles; [and] listen carefully 
tod intently during conversations 
Ginther also said that the 
‘ndividual that “sees the position 
88 a lifestyle tends to be more 
successful [as a Resident assis­
tant] than someone who sees it as 
ajob.” People who count hours do
not have an easy time being a 
resident assistant.
What is intended to make time 
spent as a resident assistant 
easier is an intense week of train­
ing. Resident assistants are not 
expected to enter the position with 
all of the fine-tuned skills they 
will need to perform their duties. 
Before most students return to 
campus from summer break, resi­
dent assistants spend between 
seven and nine days learning 
about crisis intervention, listen­
ing and counseling skills, events 
programming, and campus re­
sources.
Resident assistants work from 
8 am till 10 pm during training 
preparing to deal with things as 
they happen. Resident assistants 
“are not all things to all people,” 
Ginther said, “but that which 
people need [an RA] to be.” A 
successful resident assistant can 
assess what each individual needs 
of him or her.
Although the lifestyle of an RA 
involves giving time and support 
to others, being a resident assis­
tant is not without its rewards. 
In a letter to all RA applicants, 
the Residence Life Staff states, 
“Though most of what a resident 
assistant does involves helping 
other students, resident assis­
tants also help themselves by de­
veloping valuable leadership 
skills in the areas of communica­
tion, conflict mediation, collegial 
teamwork, and crisis manage­
ment.
In addition, resident assistants 
benefit from the relationships 
they establish with their peers 
and with professional staff mem­
bers who will know them well
and provide assistance when 
needed.”
Junior Mechanical Engineering 
major and second year resident 
assistant John Steven assessed the 
needs offreshmen to be those which 
he could best meet. Steven elected 
to spend his second year as a resi­
dent assistant in the traditionally 
all-freshman Hamerschlag Hall. 
Freshmen, Steven said, “are easier 
to work with and get out and do 
things.”
Senior Suzanne Rothfeld and first 
year resident assistant in the West 
Wing agreed with Steven, saying 
that the toughest part of her job in 
the mostly upperclassman resi­
dence hall was “to get people out 
into the hallway ... to open doors 
and meet each other.” After mak­
ing that happen, she said, her job 
was much easier.
If Paul Hrynko becomes a resi­
dent assistant and successfully gets 
the residents on his floor to open 
their doors and meet each other, he 
will have completed a three step 
application process. All new RA’s 
first must fill out an application 
form and provide three references, 
complete an interview with one of 
the Housing Office Area Coordina­
tors, and attend a group interview 
with other applicants and current 
resident assistants.
Applications for the position 
of resident assistant are still 
available from the Housing 
Office, the Skibo Information 
Desk, and the Donner Hall 
service desk. Applications for 
the position are being ac­
cepted until January 29.
‘Neurotic living at CMU’ or 
‘Life and how not to live it’

“Hey, hi, how’s it going. Welcome back, 
how was your break? Really? Great. Oh, 
you know, mine was okay. It definitely 
wasn’t long enough. But, I guess I’m ready 
to start again.”
For the most part, that is just about 
every conversation I have heard as friends 
greeted each other after the break. Not 
unusual, I’ve been guilty of the same 
inane conversation. It takes the place of, 
“How are you doing, have a good day” and 
the various other conversation fillers used 
in order not to seem at a loss for some­
thing to say. I ----------------------------------
don’t doubt that 
everybody who 
had that conver­
sation, or one 
similar, were 
fairly sincere.
However, I was 
the model of sin­
cerity when I ut­
tered those words.
I was so happy to ______________________
be back and alive
that I was practically embracing every­
body I had the merest acquaintance with.
I hadn’t been home in a few years and 
now I remember why. I’m from Hawaii (I 
can hear the sighs of pity) which is an 
okay place, if you go in for lush tropical 
paradises. The problem is that ifyou only 
have a limited amount of time in which to 
travel, an airplane is the only feasible 
modeoftransport. I happen to have, natu­
ral or unnatural, an incredible fear of 
being trapped inside tons of metal that 
hurtles through the air at a rate of speed 
that I find hard to believe. Because of this, 
my brain tries to leap out through my
nose with a blood curdling scream as the plane 
makes its descent into the airport. The thought, 
“This ve're going down,” races through 
my n Even if it is announced that the 
plane j landing, I’m pretty sure the pilot is 
saying this as the crew puts on their para­
chutes.
I go through this explanation to say how 
sincerely happy I am to see everybody back. 
However, as the week has worn on I’m starting 
to question this feeling— the joy is waning. I 
now remember why I was so happy to leave.
The pressures of being a student are nothing 
new. I’m not even talking about academic 
stress, that can usually be handled by getting 
an occasional leeching and bloodletting at a 
-------------------------------------- campus party. Fi­
nancial and social 
stress, on the other 
hand, are not as eas­
ily dealt with. I’m 
not sure that there 
is a way to deal with 
these problems — 
except, of course, by 
being born with 
enough good looks

nately, that curse has not been visited upon me 
nor upon most of the people 1 know. Actually, 
most of my friends’ only assets are their vari­
ous abilities to make fun of people who are both 
beautiful and rich.
My problem is that I end up compounding 
these normal pressures into heart attack-level 
proportions. I tend to procrastinate a little. 
Well, that might be an understatement. More 
accurately, had I been God creating the uni­

On December 1,1955, less 
than a year into King's term, 
Rosa Parks defied the city or- 
; dinance that condoned segre- 
: gation on public transporta- 
' tion. This event was the cata- 
; lyst that led to King organizing 
a year long, nonviolent and 
passive boycott of Montgom- 
! $ry public transport. Conse-

Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday celebrated today
by LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Staffwriter
January 18, the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., marks an exceptionally important day in 
our nation’s hiBtory. This day represents the dawn 
of an amazing speaker who fought the oppression 
of blacks through the ideals of nonviolent and 
peaceful protest. Although classes will still be in 
session on this day, many school organizations 
have taken time out to sponsor some activities to 
honor and commemorate his memory.
C-MAP is said to have taken the lead for finding 
the funds necessary for these events. Lavalla 
Wilson, a director and organizer of the events at C- 
MAP, believes it’s a wonderful opportunity to 
involve Btudents, faculty and community in an 
important cause. “In spite of the criticism that 
King has received, the things he stood for are still 
very real,” says Wilson. “Things may have changed 
in our history, but the concepts of unity and 
cooperation are still needed for us all to work 
together for some positive, cooperative ends."Start­
ing at 4:30 p.m. in the Skibo Ballroom, a memorial 
service will be held followed by a speech from the 
Reverend Jason Barr, a Pastor from the Macedonia 
Baptist Church in Pittsburgh. His speech entitled, 
“Where Do We Go From Here? Nonviolence: Learn­
ing it, Living it, Teaching it,” is aimed to reach 
the youth who have manifested their anger and 
rage in such channels as violence and gangs. 
“We need to employ nonviolencein this nation as 
a phisophy of life.... King’s nonviolent theme can 
still be used to address our current problems,” 
says Barr.
Following the service and reading will be a 
musical presentation from the Voices United 
GoBpel Choir (VUGC). Tara Haughton, senior 
chemiBtry major and VUGC President is excited 
about the services but hopes more students and 
faculty participate this year. “It’s an honor to be 
able to sing in the memory of Martin Luther 
King Jr.,” says Haughton. “I feel strongly about 
his movement which affects many black stu­
dents at CMU. It’s a pretty special occasion and 
I hope people come out to see it.”
To conclude the services, a candlelight vigil 
beginning at Skibo will be held. A reception will 
follow in the Faculty Dining Room in Skibo at 
6:30.
In light of the recent riotB in Los Angeles, 
increasing gang violence across the nation and 
the continual occurrences of racial prejudice, 
perhaps now more than ever is a time to remem­
ber the wise words and practices of the late Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr.

Neurotic feelings are his own fault
NEUROTIC, from page 11
Therefore, when it comes to fi­
nancial aid, I end up doing a 
fairly convincing imitation of a 
pre-reformation Martin Luther
— by which I mean that I stump 
my way up the Btairs of Warner 
Hall on bloody knees (a hairshirt 
if I’ve been very bad) hoping to 
earn forgiveness for not complet­
ing my forms on time.
Socially, I cannot be held com­
pletely responsible. In general, I 
am pretty insecure about social 
interaction and of messing up in 
front of people. I am told that this 
is not too unusual, that almost 
everybody has some degree of 
this insecurity. However, I really 
am socially inept and I have proof. 
The most recent example being
— I am still apologizing — the 
time I took a woman, on our first 
date, to a party (please, please 
forgive me, I am sorry). We
walked in and I said, “Hi, I’d like 
everyone to meet my friend 
Theresa.” She promptly intro­
duced herselfby her actual name. 
Our very first date and I intro­
duce her by a name that wasn’t 
even close — not the same let­
ters, syllables, nothing. In my 
defense, we had only met a day or 
two before, I didn’t really know 
her, and I’m sure the recent lo- 
botomy was still bothering me.
The reason I had asked her out 
was that she had called me (it’s a 
long story) naive — maybe 
boneheaded would have been 
more accurate. This is not the 
first time this sort of thing has 
happened; hence, every time I 
get involved in a social situation, 
I am convinced I will have people 
pointing and laughing as though 
I were the newest addition to the 
circus freak show.
The point is that maybe I
shouldn’t be welcoming people 
back. I should probably be apolo­
gizing that they have to be here. 
From now on, instead of “How 
was your break?” I can say, “Bum­
mer, sorry to see you, I wish you 
were somewhere else.” After re­
viewing last year, being trapped 
inside a crashing airplane seems 
a bit more relaxing. I won’t even 
begrudge the crews having para­

evitable through long-term, ac- 
tively-engaged life-planning.
Following the address, stu­
dents attended two oftheir work­
shops and then broke for lunch 
in the faculty dining room at 
Skibo. There they had an oppor­
tunity to talk with the many 
faculty members whom were in­
vited to the luncheon. After 
lunch, twomore workshops were 
given and a closing ceremony 
concluded the day.
Although attendance was lim­
ited, most participants were still 
certain of the program’s success.
“The sessions were small but very 
close,” says Harriet Schwartz 
assistant to the dean of student 
affairs. “This way we’ve taken 
each person through the process 
and it’s all worked out great.”
“I hope they learned something 
and feel more comfortable ap. 
proaching faculty and staff to 
work out problems,” says Bailey.
“I hope 
they made 
some new 
friends as 
well.”

agrees. “I’m here because I had a

The sponsors plan to evaluate 
the Reorientation program to 
make next year’s even more suc­

mistakes we made this time 
around ... but overall it was a

Save earth — recycle responsibly
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Features Editor
“You’ve all done such a great 
job of recycling that we have out­
grown our previous collection sys­
tem!” says CMU Recycling/W aste 
Management Coordinator Bar­
bara Kviz. The total materials 
recycled in 1992 were 272 tons of 
office paper, 27 tons of cardboard, 
49 tons of glass, five tons of alu­
minum, two tons of newsprint, 
2.5 tons of telephone directories, 
and 67 tons of leaf waste, accord­
ing to Kviz. As of this past De­
cember, CMU’s custodial service, 
American Building Maintenance 
(ABM), has assumed collection of
recycled materials in the aca­
demic buildings and is support­
ing the student-run Housing re­
cycling program. “You can still 
expect to take your recyclable 
materials to central drop offloca- 
tions,” says Kviz.
Most departments in the Uni­
versity now have a recycling liai­
son who works with Kviz on plan­
ning and improving recycling pro- 
cedures on campus. Liaisons 
monitor their areas and give CMU 
Recycling constructive feedback. 
You may contact your recycling 
liaison and utilize their expertise 
concerning recycling issues or 
concerns. Ifyour department does 
not have a recycling liaison, or if
you have questions or comments 
about recycling, please contact 
recycling@andrew by email or 
Kviz at x7858.
It is important to remember 
not to recycle: copy paper wrap­
pers, chip board boxes (like from 
paperclips), brown kraft enve­
lopes (made from ground wood 
paper), tissues and tissue rolls, 
coffee cups, candy wrappers, pa­
per towels, cotton wipes, brown 
bags, glossy papers, magazines, 
newsprint, telephone directories, 
or diapers.
There will be special collections 
for telephone directories and stu­
dent environmental club news­
paper drives.

Famous alums return for drama workshop
By GRACE CLEMENTS
Special to The Tartan
You’ve heard that CMU’s 
Drama Department is a breeding 
ground for stars, right? But how 
often have you actually seen any 
of them back here on campus? 
Well, you may have actually 
caught sight of some of them this 
past weekend, as they came back 
to campus to participate in a tele­
vision and motion picture semi­
nar for CMU drama students 
entitled “Images ... Imagination 
... In the 90’s and Beyond.”
Alumni participating in the 
seminar this past Thursday, Fri­
day, and Saturday included 
Emmy-Award winning actor 
Bruce Weitz (“Hill Street Blues”), 
costume designer Eduardo Castro 
(“Fame”, “Dick Tracy”), Emmy- 
Award winning production de­
signer Sy Tomashoff (“The Bold 
and the Beautiful,” “Capitol”), 
actress/writer Gloria Goldsmith 
I (“Family Ties”), director/producer 
Bruce A. Block (“Father of the 
Bride,” “Baby Boom”), actress/di­
rector/writer Angela Paton 
[ (“Carola”), writer/director Les 
Ferreira (“Head of the Class,” 
“Cops”), and former producer for 
Universal Television and CBS, 
and host/producer of the West 
Coast Dram a Alumni Clan, Jerry 
Adler.
This is the fifth year that the 
drama department has invited 
its graduates back to share their 
experiences in the film and tele­
vision industry with current stu­
dents. The seminar serves a two­
fold purpose, both to acquaint
students with the camera and to 
establish a network between the 
alumni community and the 
graduating students. “This work­
shop is designed as a crash course 
on adapting skills from the stage 
to the screen,” remarked Associ­
ate Head Donald Marinelli. 
“While we hope that specific con­
tacts occur, we 
also hope that 
the seminar 
acts as a gen­
eral reinforce­
ment of the 
Carnegie 
Mellon Connec­
tion.”
Senior acting 
major Paul 
Downey ac­
knowledges the 
importance of 
such a connec­
tion. “I don’t 
want the first 
contact I make 
with these peo­
ple to be when I 
arrive in L.A.”
Downey says 
that he’ll call the 
West Coast 
Clan a month 
before he goes, 
to let them know 
he’s coming.
“The alumni 
want to help. If you don’t call 
them, it’s your own fault.”
This year’s seminar focused on 
the changes in the entertainment 
industry due to recent techno­
logical advances. Thursday’s pre­
sentation included a demonstra­
tion of a Macintosh program that 
will reproduce a television or film 
set-design on the computer screen 
and then move the viewer through 
different parts of the set so that 
different angles can be seen. Com­
puter generated animation is also 
changing what we see on the sil­
ver screen. Often, the snow you
Groucho Marx. How is this ac­
complished? One word: technol­
ogy. “Human expression,” says 
Les Ferreira, “is being turned into 
a binary system of zeros and 
ones.... The [entertainment] ex­
perience is changing.”

ushered into the hall where they 
prepared for their individual au­
ditions. Inside, directing majors 
sat in with the industry veterans, 
taking notes on the auditions as 
an observational part of the cast­
ing team. Meanwhile graduate

would be

dilligently 
on their 
portfolios. 
Each group 
received 
hands-on 
training, 
and the 
ability to 
hear feed­
back from 
their men­
tors.
Perhaps 
the great­
est chal­
lenge for 
the the­
ater-trained actors was the switch 
from stage to screen. “I kept want­
ing to act for the audience, ” ad­
mits junior drama student 
Katherine Tobin, “but the audi­
ence doesn’t exist. It’s just you 
and the camera, and whoever else
non Mnaroyo/bpeciai to ino lartan
is in the scene with you.” The 
panelists seemed to agree with 
her assesment, as they repeat­
edly commented to students, “It’fe; 
too big. Make it smaller. You’re-' 
not on stage.”
The writers confronted the dif- Z 
Acuities of rewriting a pre-exist­
ing script in a limited amount of 
time. “You have to look at wfrat;i 
someone, else has written and; - 
write in their style,” says gradu-;. ; 
ate playwright student Melissa ' 
Martin. “You can’t go in there 
thinking that you’re going /to 
make it good or better. You’ve got 
to go with what you’re given. “
Soon, the playwrights’ scenes*-; 
were chosen , the actors were> 
cast, and short rehearsals were • ; 
conducted to prepare the actors 
for the taping to be held the ne^t 
day.
Saturday was grueling. Actors, 
were called as early as 8 am, 
knowing that they would be thete; 
until at least 5 or 6 pm with the. 
utter concentration that is re­
quired for the filming of a televi­
sion opisode. When it was all over, ! 
the only thing left to do was get 
out of costumo and wait for the ! 
film to come back from oditing so 
that they could see the fruits of ; 
their labour.
“It’s just so uncomfortable to’ 
watch,” recalls sonior acting mn- •• 
jor Molissa Papp of last year’s 
project. “I mean, you see yourself I 
on the screen, and *¦* •
to die.”
And Hollywood’s 
CMU? Well, as director 
Block puts it, “People sit up 
they hear Carnegie.”
Technology meets creativity in recent art gallery openings
Interactive art shown at Hewlett Gallery
By TARA M. SEMAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
Ifyou have an extra hour’s time 
this week, consider spendingitat 
the 1992 Artificial Intelligence 
Based Arts Exhibition. The exhi­
bition runs through Saturday, 
January 23 at the Hewlett Gal­
lery in the CFA building. This 
interesting interactive exhibit 
consists of four parts: Edge of 
Intention, Genetic Images, Syn­
thetic Emotional Speech, and Is 
it Mozart or is it EMI (Experi­
ments in Musical Intelligence)?
The Edge of Intention portion 
is the Carnegie Mellon part of the 
exhibit. It is the result of collabo­
ration between the Oz project and 
the Graphics and Animation re­
search group in the School of Com­
puter Science (SCS). The piece 
allows the observer to interact 
with it through the use of the 
mouse. The observer can control 
the actions of the one of the color­
ful ball-shaped characters on the 
screen.
The members of the group that 
created this portion of the exhibit 
are Joseph Bates (research com­
puter scientist, SCS), Andrew 
'Vitkin(associate professor, SCS), 
James Altucher (Studio for Cre­
ative Inquiry), Alexander

meaning is conveyed through the 
speed and tone of the words. The 
goal of Synthetic Emotional 
Speech was to add “an emotional 
component [that] would expand 
the expressive range of synthe­
sized speech,” says Janet Cahn, a 
PhD student at the MIT Media 
Laboratory, in her statement 
about the project.
The observer uses the 
mouse to select what short 
exchange he or she wishes to 
hear. The computer has four 
dialogues to choose from, in­
cluding two passages from 
Samuel Beckett’s “Waitingfor 
Godot” and Abbott and 
Costello’s “Who’s on First.” 
The computer speech is rather 
convincing. It is able to con­
vey impatience, annoyance, 
and plaintiveness rather well.
The last portion of the ex­
hibit is entitled Is it Mozart 
or is it EMI. The computer

Organic, inorganic, join at Forbes Gallery
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
Tartan staffwriter
What is an art show?
Is it a boring, stifling tedium, 
an endless onslaught of inten­
tionally indecipherable images?
Or could it be something differ­
ent?
Last week’s art show at the 
Forbes Gallery might have been 
just that. Art students Faye 
Levine and Sherri Johnson and 
recent College of Fine Arts gradu­
ate Nathan Moody presented 
about sixty pieces of artwork dur­
ing the show, which ran from 
Tuesday to Sunday.
Over 100 people attended the 
two hour reception last Friday, 
where the artists entertained 
their guests with cheese trays 
and a videotape which displayed 
short computer animation se­
quences and described the ideas 
behind their work.
“Lots of people were glued to 
Nate’s video work,” said Levine, 
a senior illustration major. “We 
did something different by video­
taping our artists’ statement 
rather than having a written one 
hanging on the wall.”
Because the artists thought 
that they could find some com­
mon themes in their work, they 
decided to combine their talents 
for the show. Moody and Levine’s 
pieces were primarily done on 
the computer, while Johnson’s 
work was done with more tradi­
tional media.
Tim Ross, a computational lin­
guistics student visiting the show, 
thought the different styles of 
artwork complemented each 
other well. “Like other things at 
Carnegie Mellon, everything was 
interrelated. I think Johnson’s 
work was the most interesting. 
That was even harder to achieve 
because most of her works were 
in black and white and eyes are 
attracted to color,” said Ross.
Moody, too, thought that the 
contrast worked. “There was a 
direct antithesis between my art­
work and Sherri’s artwork in the 
contrast between organic and in-
Kevin Chen/Tartan Photagrapher mhnsesRoT^ gD BoEons Ivh aBNTGNso 8NslNn S. v,,TD
organic shapes. However, there 
was some similarity in that my 
pieces and Sherri’s pieces were 
both self-referential,” he said.
A pastel piece by Levine en­
titled “Someplace Warm and 
Dark” showed a convoluted in­
tro versive structure of black cloth 
marked by bright glowing bands. 
It seemed to be a comforting hid­
ing space away from the ills of the
world.
According to Levine, the shape ; 
was meant to suggest, instead;b£ \ 
directly show, emotions. “I don't 
usually like to give explicit me§- . 
sages. I like to leave things opeirt;: : 
Even though the color and shape 
mean something in particular;to 
me, it allows other people to find 
things in it.”

The Decline of Western Civilization Part III: The Amy Fisher Story
By TINA L. URSO
Tartan Diversions Editor
Well, for all of you who thought tele- 
: vision couldn’t possibly get any worse, 
a few weeks at home without school- 
work in front of the TV over break 
should have been enough to make you 
think twice. Now don’t get me wrong, 
there are certainly plenty of great 
things to watch, if you happen to turn 
the TV on at just the right time. But it 
seems as though the availability of 
such shows and the minds ofTVexecu­
tives have become smaller and smaller 
over the past few weeks.
" I don’t think I need to drop hints 
here, I think we all know what I’m 
talking about. The Amy Fisher 
Story(ies) has been an American trag­
edy I’m sure all of us will find difficult 
-to explain ordealwith,butIthinkifwe 
all pull together as a country and real­
ize it for what it is, we’ll learn how to 
handle this affliction somehow, and 
perhaps even get over it with minimal 
1‘eruns.
The first questions I think we all 
have been trying to figure out are: How 
the hell did this happen? Where did it 
come from? And most tragically: Why 
did so many of us watch it?
I think it’s become clear that we’ve all 
been horribly used and manipulated by 
Amy Fisher and her accomplices, the TV 
executives who thought this whole thing 
would be a great way to boost Sunday 
night ratingB. At least, that’s how it 
started on NBC. Then the Buttafuoco 
gang had to get in 
on it with CBS, so 
they could make 
their fair $300,000 
share of the deal, 
which of course 
prompted ABC to 
offer their version, 
just so they 
wouldn’t miss out 
on the big ripe rat­
ings crop the other 
networks had al­
ready sown.
I think we all 
know that Sunday 
night is just about 
the worst night for 
TV watching, full of 
reruns and paid 
programming. It’s 
also the night when 
most people are 
home to watch TV.
I guess Fisher, the Buttafuocos, and 
executives from the three networks put 
two and two together to realize this 
whole deal meant one thing: big ratings 
and lots of money. With total Nielsen 
ratings between the three Amy Fishers
ending up almost 53 percent, it looks as 
though they succeeded in turning many 
of us into almost helpless victims of 
manipulation, poor souls tryingto choose 
between the lesser of three evils.
As for myself, I managed to escape the 
actual FiBher Btories themselves, flee­
ing from my sister and father who were 
each watching one of the stories on a 
different network, to our basementwhere 
I managed to catch up on some sewing 
while I watched MTVs Week In Rock on 
our illegally hooked up cable TV. How­
ever, I doubt between all of the commer­
cials and promos on TV, related stories 
on local evening newscasts, TV Guide, 
and variouslatenightshows, many were 
able to escape “Long Island Lolita” com­
pletely. The fact that I’m writing and 
you’re reading this article proves that 
none of us 
have been 
saved.
However, 
Fisher isn’t 
the first (or 
the last) in­
escapable 
omnipresent 
media spec­
ter to haunt 
our lives, she 
just seems to 
be the most 
recent and 
the most hard 
to explain. 
With the re- 
centissuingof 
the Elvis 
stamp in 
honor of his 
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art Editor would-be 58th 
birthday, I 
think we’ve all seen a bit more of The 
King than is healthy for anyone who 
isn’t a die-hard Elvis fan. From the Elvis 
impersonator handing out stamps in your 
local post office to the Elvis tribute show 
on TBS to the melodramas of Elvis’ per­
sonal life, there’s been no escaping Elvis 
in any crevice of Americana.
But somehow, the Elvis phenomenais 
different than the recent Fisher afflic­
tion. People care about Elvis, devote 
their lives to him, buy all his collector 
plates, look for him faithfully in grocery 
stores, and cry when they listen to his 
songs. He’s been a phenomenon si net: 
before we were kids. However tacky, 
he’s ablazingrhinestone-studded chuik 
of American culture. The spirit of 
Elvisness everywhere even coerced me 
into watching Viva Las Vegas this year, 
my first Elvis movie to date.
But no one cares about Amy Fisher. 
Except maybe Fisher herself, the TV 
executives, TV Guide, and maybe .the 
Buttafuocos. She’s just some stupiiS, 
messed up ho from Long Island who 
managed to get a good agent with a nose 
for ratings. I’d be pretty disgusted with 
the whole thing myself if it hadn’t given 
Saturday Night Live crew enough mate­
rial to actually write a funny show fora 
change. But let’s hope this whole event 
has taught us all enough of a lesson that 
we won’t let such a plight attack the 
networks for at least a little while, any­
way.

Thursday, January 21A Clockwork Orange
I wouldn’t exactly invite the young-uns to see this 
one. Although it’s a superb film with wonderful 
psychotic acting by Malcolm McDowell, it’s the type 
of film that the weak-hearted would turn off after 
about ten or twenty minutes.
Stanley Kubrick presents a view of the macabre 
and twisted Alex who is drawn to drugs, crime, and 
rape with his posse of "droogs". He inevitably gets 
caught and is thrown into a mind-manipulating 
experiment designed to purge every urge of 
delinquincy from his body.
If you see this film, be ready to start thinking 
about society’s control over our minds to do what is 
"right".
Wow, deep thoughts for only a buck.

Saturday, January 23Highlander
This visually captivating movie by Russel 
Mulcahy tells the tale of a race of immortals who 
live among humans. These immortals live through 
history battling each other in an attempt to fulfill 
their somewhat vague purpose worded by the an­
tagonist as "There can be only one!" Christopher 
Lambert plays McCloud, an immortal bom in six­
teenth century Scotland who tries to come to grips 
with his destiny. Sean Connery has a supporting 
role as his mentor, another immortal, who tries to 
prepare him for the trials that their kind must 
endure. McCloud makes his way to 1980's America 
and tries to settle in, but is hounded by an immor­
tal played by Clancy Brown who hunted him four 
centuries ago in Scotland.
Highlander combines sword battle scenes with 
an intriguing science-fiction plot. The director be­
gan his career with music videos and it shows well 
with creative edits and fades. This movie has 
developed something of a cult following. There is 
also a very disappointing sequel which should in 
no way be used to judge the quality of the original 
and should not be seen especially if you enjoyed the 
first. The movie is rated R for sexual situations 
with McCloud and his love-interest and some well- 
done graphic violence.

Adams’ new sci-fi proves to be Mostly Harmless
By JENNIFER URSO
Tartan Photo Editor
With the fifth book in the “in­
creasingly inaccurately named 
Hitchhikers Trilogy,” Douglas 
Adams gives readers some of his 
best writing yet.
Mostly Harmless tracks the 
unusual events leading up to and 
including Arthur, Trillian, and 
Ford’s bizarre reunion—-one long 
awaited after their abrupt sepa­
ration at the end olLife, the Uni­
verse, and Everything (the third 
book in the trilogy). Adams com­
plicates matters by introducing 
the concept of parallel universes 
and parallel life forms, which he 
insists you won’t ever understand 
but “can therefore say ‘What?’ 
and ‘Eh?’ and even go cross-eyed 
and start to blither if you like 
without any fear of making a fool 
of yourself. ” Confusingly enough, 
he makes this issue the basis for 
all the ensuing eventsofthestory.
Arthur makes his way to what 
he believes is Earth, only to find 
that he has to turn the maps 
upside-down to make any sense 
of them and that the planet’s
actual name is NowWhat, a glum, 
cold, and wet mass of boringness. 
So he leaves and starts to lead a 
happy life as supreme sandwich 
maker on Lamuella. Trillian, a 
reporter for the galaxy, has a 
child by a sperm bank that 
Arthur had coincidentally 
frequented. Tricia 
McMillan, Trillian’s par­
allel universe counterpart 
and a reporter on Earth, 
travels to the memoryless 
10th planet to fix their 
computer system. And 
Ford returns to the Guide 
offices only to discover that 
it’s been taken over by the 
Vogons and that a new, 
more mind manipulating 
Guide has been made.
Arthur’s pleasant sand­
wich-making life is soon 
disturbed by the arrival of 
his incidentally born 
daughter, Random, a con­
fused girl who has lived 
her entire life on a space­
ship and had been fre­
quently abandoned by her 
mother.
In another valiant at­
tempt to save the universe,
Ford sends the new Guide 
to Arthur for safekeeping, 
but Random opens the 
package before anyone gets 
to it. It turns into a raven, hijacks 
Ford’s spacecraft, and takes Ran­
dom to Earth, thus beginning a 
number of consecutive spacecraft 
landings on Earth.
Ford; Arthur, and Trillian go to
Earth to find Random. Tricia 
McMillan covers it all for tho lo­
cal news. Meanwhile, the Vogons 
are lining themselves up behind 
tho sun for tho sacond final de­
struction of tho Earth in order to

trast to the last of the Hitchhiker 
books, So Long and Thanks'for

Long’s tondency to confuse‘you 
by randomly shifting from ontj 
focal point to another, this tilth 
book still confuses yoi> 
but instead focuses oi)

you something to think 
about as to life in ,the 
rest of the galaxy, .the 
significance of the 
planet Earth, and,, of 
course, the concept of 
parallel universes.,On 
top of that, it still con­
tains Adams’ ev.er- 
present wit and humor. 
For those who think 
they don’t like science 
fiction and therefore 
have never read any of 
Adams’ books, they are 
missing out. v-. j 
But who’s to say that 
this is the end anyway? 
A satisfied Vogon

mean the destructionof

Next to it, a color printout 
showed a brown and white guinea 
pig reclining in repose, with car­
rots flowing from its head as it 
dreamed rodentthoughtsoffood.
When asked why she chose a 
guinea pig as the the topic for 
this piece of computer art, Levine 
replied, “I know this is not what 
an artist should say, but I like 
them and they make me happy. I 
saw one sleeping one day, and I 
wondered what it dreamed of.”
To the right of the computer 
printout was a black-and-white 
sketch by Johnson called “Matri­
arch.”
This self-portrait was of a nude 
figure holding a gnarled length 
of wood and wearing a clay amu­
let. Set against an elusive land­
scape and with a branch of leaveB 
in the fore, the woman seemed to 
be a representation of an earth 
spirit, a Gaian entity incarnate.
Johnson, an illustration/design 
major, said she chose the setting 
because she “found the form fas­
cinating. It became a mediation. 
It was a self portrait as I could 
have been.”
Moody had one of his pieces on 
the next wall, a huge five foot by 
four foot pastel and acrylic image 
of what appeared to be a hallway 
shrouded in shadow, with light 
emanating from the far end.
“Those pieces are untitled, but 
I refer to them as mind temples. 
They started out as a funky kind 
of thing to try out—self-referen­
tial artwork without resorting to 
self-portraiture. They’re about 
me, and I assign shapes and 
spaces to what I feel,” said Moody.
Moody also created about five 
minutes of digital computer ani­
mation which appeared on the 
videotape playing in the opposite 
comer of the gallery.
