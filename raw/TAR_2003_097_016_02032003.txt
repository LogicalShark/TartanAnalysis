Research will 
study risks 
of terrorism
by Matt Rado
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon’s reputation as a 
defense research facility appears to 
be growing. On January 20, Carnegie 
Mellon announced a $1.1 million dol­
lar grant given to the Department of 
Engineering and Public Policy by the 
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation. The grant will be used to 
study the defense risks created by ter­
rorism and weapons of mass destruc­
tion.
The research done will eventually 
be used to design defense systems 
that carry a smaller risk of being 
appropriated by terrorists and used 
against the United States.
According to Granger Morgan of 
CMU’s Department of Engineering 
and Public Policy and Kennette 
Benedict, director of the 
International Peace and Security sec­
tion of the MacArthur Foundation, 
this work is unlike most of the work 
that has been targeted by critics of 
government-funded research at uni­
versities.
The relationship between the 
MacArthur Foundation and Carnegie 
Mellon is unlike most other funding 
relationships with CMU because this 
work is being done through private 
funding, not through the govern­
ment, which makes it easier for 
researchers to come to conclusions 
that may challenge the government’s 
ideas about defense policy.
“We’re trying to provide some bal­
ance so scientists feel free to take the 
research where it takes them,” said 
Benedict. He also said that quite often 
the government’s defense policy 
doesn’t get the scrutiny and analysis 
from independent sources that it 
should, and that a benefit of privately 
funded research is that it can be help­
ful to those that don’t always see eye- 
to-eye with the government.
The MacArthur Foundation began 
this* process by sending requests to 
nine different major universities, ask­
ing them for research proposals on 
the subject of security and weapons 
of mass destruction. This request 
came with the caveat that a limited 
amount of grant money would be 
available to each school.
The grant is designed to be used for 
the research itself, for faculty 
salaries, and for the creation of new 
faculty positions. So far, according to 
Benedict, there have been ten new 
faculty positions added to universi­
ties across the country as a result of 
the grant money.
The schools submitting proposals 
included Cornell University, the 
Georgia Institute of Technology, 
Harvard University, Princeton 
University, Stanford University, the 
University of Illinois, the University of 
Maryland, and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. The abstract 
presented by Carnegie Mellon to the 
MacArthur Foundation had a number 
of broad points. These included 
involving engineers in security issues, 
diffusing security interests through­
out the University, and working on 
the implications of terrorist attacks 
on civilian targets and issues with the 
Pakistani-Indian relationship. 
Specifically, the document proposed 
work in a number of significant secu- 
rity-related areas. These include 
developing technology for advance 
detection of bio-terrorism attacks, 
risk analysis for mail systems, reduc­
ing the risk of cyber-attacks, and 
adding security dimensions to the 
doctoral work of three PhD students 
that are already in progress. The 
work will result in the completion of 
six PhDs.
“[$1.1 million] sounds like a lot of 
money, but it gets spread thin. It 
doesn’t go as far as you’d like,” said 
Morgan. However, he says, the 
impact of the money maybe more far- 
reaching than it initially appears to 
be. Morgan says that the money will 
be “seeded” and spread out among a 
variety of different areas. The result, 
he says, is that if some of the research 
proves especially promising, 
researchers could go to other sources 
for more money to expand their 
work.
The work involving the grant 
money has only recently begun. The 
first Seminar meeting was only held 
this Thursday, January 30. Much of 
the work being done will involve doc­
toral students and faculty.
Some students involved in the orig­
inal proposal may not be involved in 
the research that is beginning now 
that the grant money has arrived.

INS watches foreign 
CMU students, faculty
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
A new electronic database is sup­
posed to allow the INS to keep clos­
er tabs on over half a million inter­
national students currently studying 
in the US. This includes 2,000 for­
eign students at Carnegie Mellon, as 
well as 500 visiting professors and 
scholars. Three thousand institu­
tions were required to have the data­
base, called the Student and Visitor 
Information System or SEVIS, up 
and running by last Thursday. But 
several schools were having difficul­
ty accessing or using the database 
last week. The INS granted schools a 
grace period of 15 days from 
January 30 to convert to the system.
Lisa Krieg, director of the Office of 
International Education, stated that 
CMU was “experiencing serious 
delays and technical difficulties 
along with hundreds of institutions 
around the US (or more). To put it in 
common terms, the SEVIS system 
basically ground to a halt and the 
SEVIS help desk was entirely over­
whelmed by problems, questions, 
etc. from the users (including us).”
According to Krieg, the database, 
once it becomes active, is primarily a 
shift from paper records to electron­
ic ones.
Tracking international students in
the US has been an overwhelming 
task for the INS, said Krieg.
“They’re chasing papers all over 
the country,” she said. “The system 
that has existed is paper-based, and 
quite inefficient on the government 
side. They don’t really know where 
students are or any other foreigners 
in the United States.”
The electronic database will allow 
the INS to access information they 
have always required, such as the 
intended degree of the student, how 
much the program costs them, their 
country of birth, etc. In addition, 
information that has always been 
available upon request, such as the 
physical and mailing addresses of all 
foreign students, as well as their 
enrollment status, will be entered 
into the SEVIS database.
The database is part of post 
September 11, 2001 legislation to 
make sure foreigners in the US are 
here to do what they say they came 
to do. But Krieg said tracking for­
eign students is only a small part of 
that process.
“For those of us who believe in 
international education and feel 
powerfully in the exchange of inter­
national education to break down 
barriers, we don’t understand how 
the tracking of this small percent 
will help when the vast majority of

Smoking policies gain ground on campus
by Hannah Yi
Staffwriter
The Smoke Free Housing Task 
Force has presented the Student 
Dormitory Council with a new draft 
of the University Smoking Policy, 
which will prohibit smoking in all 
campus housing starting in the fall 
semester of 2004.
According to the current policy, 
students are permitted to smoke in 
designated areas and in the rooms of 
residence halls if all occupants 
agree. In addition, smoking is not 
allowed within 20 feet of housing 
entrances.
The move towards a change in the 
current policy began when a task 
force committee, consisting of facul­
ty, staff, students, smokers, and non- 
smokers was created to study the 
detrimental effects of second-hand
smoke on non-smokers.
After studying student and faculty 
surveys, comparisons to peer institu­
tions, and various health reports, 
the committee concluded that all 
campus residences should be smoke- 
free. The task force recommenda­
tions will not extend to privately- 
owned residences like Webster Hall 
and Fairfax Apartments or to special 
interest groups like Greek organiza­
tions. According to the task force’s 
final report, 67 percent of surveyed 
residents agreed that CMU campus 
residencies should be completely 
smoke-free, and 93 percent of resi­
dents agreed that second-hand 
smoke poses a health risk to non- 
smokers.
“The needs of a majority take 
precedence, especially when it is 
reconfirmed that second-hand 
smoke is a hazard to non-smokers,” 
said Tim Michael, Director of
Housing Services and a member of 
the task force committee. “There are 
more and more students coming in 
with health problems and second­
hand smoke is one of the trigger 
causes.”
In a study done by Harvard 
University’s School of Public Health, 
exposure to second-hand smoke 
doubles the risk of heart disease. 
Those exposed to second-hand 
smoke on a regular basis have a 91 
percent higher risk of heart disease 
and an 88-percent increased risk of 
heart attack.
“It is statistically shown that the 
number of people who smoke is 
reduced drastically if they live in 
smoke-free housing,” said Michael. 
“Our job is to provide a smoke-free 
environment and to reinforce 
healthy habits.”

Students bring national African American fraternity to CMU

Junior Staffwriter
Three Carnegie Mellon University 
students were recently inducted into 
the Beta Epsilon chapter of Kappa 
Alpha Psi, a Pittsburgh chapter of the 
historically African American frater­
nity.
Junior chemical engineering major 
Kristopher Howard, sophomore busi­
ness administration major Delon T. 
White II, and sophomore computer 
science and Spanish double major 
Larry D. Thomas were inducted in a 
private ceremony at an undisclosed 
location on December 14, 2002.
According to Thomas, after observ­
ing the benefits of joining a histori­
cally African American fraternity, the 
three of them felt that it was time for 
Carnegie Mellon University to have 
their own chapter in conjunction 
with Beta Epsilon.
“I think its important to have a his­
torically black fraternity at CMU 
because its another opportunity on 
CMU’s campus to to see each other on
a regular basis, unite the minority 
community, and then contribute back 
to our community,” said Thomas.
Their advisor, Damian Dourado, 
also the program associate for the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Project, says 
this kind of fellowship is very impor­
tant.
“With the small amount of stu­
dents of color on [CMU’s] campus, it 
is very important to have a support 
mechanism for them,” said Dourado.
“Thus, Kappa Alpha Psi exists to 
bring men of culture, patriotism, and 
honor together in a bond of fraterni­
ty. Kappa Alpha Psi can serve as that 
support mechanism while training 
them for leadership,” he said.
Howard and others are hoping to 
start a Beta Epsilon chapter of Kappa 
Alpha Psi at Carnegie Mellon by next 
year.
Dourado will continue to will serve 
as an advisor for Howard, White, and 
Thomas.

Housing cuts Cathedral Mansions leases
See MACARTHUR, page A5
by Nick Ennis
Staffwriter
One of Carnegie Mellon’s oldest 
off-campus apartment leases will be 
significantly reduced next fall. 
Housing Services will discontinue
46 percent of its leases in Cathedral 
Mansions.
Additionally, it hopes to eliminate 
all undergraduate housing in nearby 
Saxony Apartments.
The need for off-campus beds will
be significantly less next year 
because of the creation of over 300 
new spaces in the new dormitory on 
Morewood Avenue and in 
Henderson House. The total number 
of students expected to live in off- 
campus apartments next fall is 691, 
down from 884 this year.
This follows several years of 
increasing the supply of off-campus 
beds to fulfill the University’s guar­
antee that all students who request 
housing will receive it.
The decision to drop many of the
Cathedral Mansions leases was due 
primarily to the building’s physical 
condition.
“We just don’t feel [Cathedral 
Mansions] is the quality of housing 
that students expect,” said Tim 
Michael, director of Housing 
Services.
According to Michael, the number 
of complaints and maintenance 
requests received by residents in 
Cathedral Mansions has increased in

US jingoism earns 
: mistrust in the UN
) ’, UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Key
• members of the UN Security Council 
" Said Wednesday that the United
States has so far failed to convince 
<' them that time has run out for a
• peaceful resolution to the crisis with 
'.>Iraq.
At a crucial council meeting a day 
' ’after President Bush’s State of the 
Union address, 11 of the 15 members 
' Supported giving more time to 
¦ -weapons inspectors to pursue Iraq’s
- peaceful disarmament, council diplo­
mats told the Associated Press.
' Calling for continued inspections 
’ were France, Russia, and China, 
'' which all have veto power, as well as 
»•’Germany, Mexico, Chile, Guinea, 
«Cameroon, Syria, Angola, and 
¦; Pakistan. Only Bulgaria and Spain
- backed the United States and Britain 
'in focusing on Iraq’s failures rather 
than the inspections process.
In Washington, White House 
spokesman Ari Fleischer said diplo-
> macy was in its “final phase.”
¦ Secretary of State Colin Powell said
’ -the United States would try to help
- find a haven for Saddam Hussein, his 
'family, and close aides if he would 
agree to go into exile.
“That would be one way to try to 
1 avoid war,” Powell, who will address
- 'the Security Council next Wednsday, 
said at a news conference. State 
Department officials, however, said 
that an exile scenario was not under
- “serious consideration.
- 1 In remarks televised Wednesday in 
Iraq, Hussein was defiant. He said his
- -country “has huge capabilities” and is 
ready to face a US attack, “destroy it,
- 'and defeat it.”
“When faced with an attack, we 
-always put in our calculation the
> Worst-case scenario, and we build our 
tactics on that,” the Iraqi leader told
•f military commanders. “We will have 
' long successive defense lines with 
H i continued support of equipment.”
At the day long Security Council 
meeting, held behind closed doors, 
Britain remained squarely in 
Washington’s camp.
' “There are members of the council
• who are asking for time, but it isn’t a 
!’ matter of time. It’s a matter of 
! whether Iraq realizes that the game is 
; up, or whether it is trying to keep the
inspectors at bay,” British
• Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said 
! during a break in the meeting.
; US diplomats had hoped the meet­
ing would signal increased interna­
tional support for military action in 
Iraq, but neither the largely negative 
reports from weapons inspectors on 
Monday nor Bush’s address on 
Tuesday altered the positions of some 
of America’s key allies, including 
France.
“The majority of the council thinks 
we should continue inspections,” said 
French Ambassador Jean-Marc de la 
Sabliere. “This is what they think 
today, and I think it is important to 
say so.”
Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov 
said Russia wanted “undeniable 
proof’ that Iraq was rearming, and he 
dismissed reports that Moscow was 
shifting to a more pro-American 
stance. Still, US Ambassador John 
Negroponte warned that “the time for 
decision-making is fast approaching.”
UN inspector raises 
questions on tubes
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The top 
nuclear inspector conceded 
Wednesday that the aluminum tubes 
the Iraqis had sought for rockets 
could be modified for a nuclear pro­
gram, as President Bush reasserted in 
his State of the Union address.
“We believe the tubes were des­
tined for the conventional rocket pro­
gram,” Mohamed ElBaradei told The 
Associated Press in an interview. 
“They could be used for enrichment 
but they need substantial modifica­
tion before they could be used.”
He said such a process would be 
expensive, time-consuming, and 
detectable, but that the Iraqis have 
the capabilities to alter the tubes.
ElBaradei told the Security Council 
in a report on Monday that he had 
found no evidence that Iraq had 
revived its nuclear program. His com­
ments, coupled with his determina­
tion that the tubes were for rockets, 
put him at odds with the Bush admin­
istration which has insisted that the 
tubes were meant for enriching ura­
nium.
The back-and-forth between the 
Bush administration and ElBaradei’s 
International Atomic Energy Agency 
began shortly after the president first 
drew attention to Iraqi attempts to 
buy the materials when he addressed 
the United Nations last September. As 
a result, ElBaradei made it a top pri­
ority for his team to investigate the 
matter when inspections resumed 
two months later. Iraq admitted they 
sought the tubes, but said they were 
for a rocket program, and very quick­
ly the nuclear team began to agree.
: AOL-Time Warner’s 
•i leader steps down
: NEW YORK (AP) — Ted Turner, the
billionaire media mogul who pio- 
• neered cable television and built 
CNN, is stepping down as vice chair­
man of AOL-Time Warner Inc.
The world’s biggest media compa­
ny made the announcement 
. Wednesday as it reported a stagger- 
' ing fourth-quarter loss of $44.9 bil- 
; lion, largely because of a huge decline 
¦ in the value of its stock.
Turner, who sold his cable empire 
; to Time Warner in 1996, will leave in 
; May. He has long been reported to be 
unhappy with his diminished role 
since the Time Warner-AOL merger.
“I have not come to this decision 
lightly,” Turner, 64, said in a state- 
i ment Wednesday. “As you know, this 
! company has been a significant part 
; of my life for over 50 years.”
; Turner was uncharacteristically 
! understated as he attempted to tiptoe 
i away from the media powerhouse he 
helped create, talking only about his 
desire to focus on his philanthropic 
endeavors.
“Over the last five years, it has 
become even clearer to me how much 
personal satisfaction I derive from 
these activities,” he said. “Therefore, I 
would like to now devote even more 
time, effort, and resources to them.”
Turner pledged $1 billion to the 
United Nations in 1997, and commit­
ted $250 million over five years to 
reducing nuclear arsenals. He also 
gives about $50 million each year to 
the Turner Foundation, sending the 
money to causes ranging from pro­
motion of population control to sav­
ing woodpeckers and black-footed 
ferrets.
AOL said Wednesday that, in a 
three month timespan, it lost $44.9 
billion, or $10.04 per share, com­
pared with a loss of $1.8 billion, or 41 
cents per share, in the fourth quarter 
of 2001. In the same period, revenue
rose 8 percent to $11.4 billion.
AOL-Time Warner took a $45.5 bil­
lion charge to account for the compa­
ny’s plunging value. Without that 
“goodwill writedown,” the company 
said its results actually beat Wall 
Street estimates.
US economy looks 
hopeless; debt soars
WASHINGTON (AP) — This year’s 
federal deficit will soar to $199 bil­
lion even without President Bush’s 
new tax cut plan or a war against 
Iraq, the Congressional Budget Office 
said Wednesday in a report that cast 
doubt on chances for balancing the 
budget anytime soon.
The nonpartisan budget office pro­
jected that without action on any tax 
or spending initiatives — which no 
one considers realistic — small annu­
al surpluses would not return until 
2007, a year later than the office pre­
dicted in August.
In perhaps the starkest depiction of 
how rapidly the government’s long- 
range outlook has eroded, the budget 
office said Wednesday that it envi­
sioned a cumulative $20 billion sur­
plus over the decade that began last 
year. In May 2001, the office project­
ed an unprecedented $5.6 trillion 
surplus for that same period.
The bleak forecast further 
inflamed this year’s budget fight 
between Bush and congressional 
Democrats, who accuse each other of 
speeding the downward spiral of the 
government’s books.
Bush wants more tax cuts and 
spending restraint, while Democrats 
prefer higher spending and smaller 
tax reductions.
“The elephant in the room he didn't 
mention last night was the deficit,” 
said Representative John Spratt (D- 
SC) referring to the president’s State 
of the Union address.
“The question he avoided was: how 
would he do all the things he’s talking 
about in the State of the Union and 
have any kind of bottom line left in 
the budget?”

“Our nation is at war, our 
economy is in recession and the 
civilized world faces unprece­
dented dangers. Yet the state of 
our union has never been 
stronger. Jobs are created when 
the economy grows; the economy 
grows when Americans have 
more money to spend and invest; 
and the best, fairest way to make 
sure Americans have the money 
is not to tax it away in the first 
place. ”

they’re meant to be representing? 
Isn’t that what this money; this 
war, is supposed to be about?”

Alum one of two 
hostage reporters
EVANSTON, 111. (U-WIRE) — A 
Medill alumna is one of two free­
lance journalists on assignment for 
the Los Angeles Times who are 
being held captive in war-torn 
Colombia, Medill officials learned 
Tuesday.
Ruth Morris, Medill ’95, and 
photographer Scott Dalton disap­
peared January 21 after being 
detained at a rebel roadblock 
between the towns of Saravena and 
Tame in northeast Colombia.
The pair’s taxi driver, Madiel 
Ariza, told the Los Angeles Times 
that members of the National 
Liberation Army, known by its 
Spanish initials ELN, said Morris 
and Dalton were being taken to 
meet with a high-ranking ELN offi­
cial. The group claimed responsi­
bility for the journalists’ capture in 
a radio broadcast last Thursday.
Reuters reported Tuesday that 
an ELN commander told a local 
radio station the pair was in good 
health and would be released in 
the next few days.
Medill School of Journalism 
Dean Loren Ghiglione said he 
spoke to Los Angeles Times Editor 
John Carroll and hopes to keep stu­
dents and professors updated.
“We’re tremendously concerned 
about her as a school, and we’ll try 
to keep everybody informed in the 
Medill community,” Ghiglione said.
In addition to posting a story
about Morris’ abduction on the 
Medill Web site, Ghiglione said that 
the school likely will broadcast infor­
mation, including tapes of Morris’ 
broadcast stories, on plasma televi­
sion screens in the McCormick 
Tribune Center lobby.
The area where Morris and Dalton 
were captured is a political hot spot in 
Colombia’s nearly 40-year civil war. A 
week before the abduction, 70 US 
Special Forces troops arrived in the 
Arauca region to train Colombian 
troops, who will defend an oil 
pipeline that has been the frequent 
target of rebel attacks.
Jon Ziomek, director of Medill’s 
graduate programs, told students in 
Professor David Nelson’s newswriting 
class that Morris, a British national 
who grew up in California, wanted to 
use her Spanish language skills in her 
career after she left Northwestern 
University. She had been in Colombia 
since at least 1999.
“We are all very worried about 
her,” Ziomek said.
Ghiglione said he believes that spe­
cific preparation is necessary for jour­
nalists who want to work abroad.
“Certainly it’s a subject that 
becomes a real-life teaching tool for 
all of us that are encouraging stu­
dents to study abroad,” he said. “We 
are sensitive to the responsibility that 
we have if students are going abroad. 
We need to prepare them.”

30 years, would ban donations by 
corporations, unions, or associations 
to parties at the national level, but 
permit up to $1,000 a year in total to 
riding associations.
Block bricks, made of sand and
cement, will replace clay bricks

years there will not be a single brick­
field in the country for producing clay

tion of block bricks only. This was dis­
closed by the Minister for 
Environment and Forest Shahjahan 
Siraj last week.
“We are taking this initiative in 
order to avoid the trend of indiscrim­
inate use of wood or timbers in the 
brick-fields, as an alternative mea­
sure to protect the environment.”
Environmental issues will cause 
^ heated battles for the 108th

pus. The Bodega Marine 
Laboratory is a center for research 
and education where opportunities 
for undergraduates are only a short 
drive away. Friday was the applica­
tion deadline for students interest­
ed in participating in a unique 
opportunity to live and work there 
while taking courses toward stan­
dard UCD degrees.
“The main goal of our program is 
to teach students hands-on biology. 
Often at a large university, [the stu­
dents] don’t get the one-on-one 
interaction with faculty that they 
deserve,” said Gabrielle Nevitt, an 
associate professor of neurobiolo­
gy, physiology, and behavior and 
undergraduate advisor for the 
marine biology area of emphasis.
Opened by Berkeley in 1966 and 
turned over to UCD in 1984, the 
BML focuses on research relevant 
to aquaculture and fisheries, cell 
biology, organismic biology, and 
population biology.
Currently, 37 UCD faculty mem­
bers, 98 research scientists and 84 
graduate students work on a vari­
ety of research projects. Visiting 
scientists and undergraduates add 
to the marine lab’s diversity and 
create an environment that fosters 
research year-round. Still, many 
undergraduates hardly know that 
it exists. Marie Nydam, a senior, 
spent spring 2002 at BML.
“I think people don’t go because 
they want to go away somewhere 
exotic, but for me, it was worth­
while,” Nydam said.
“Even though it is close, it is sep­
arated. Everyone is focused on 
research, and that’s nice because 
you can find out if you want to pur­
sue a career in the sciences.”

PA nurses strike for 
rights and respect
WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) — 
Hundreds of striking nurses were 
locked out of Wilkes-Barre General 
Hospital over the weekend after they 
rejected management’s final contract 
offer.
More than 400 members of the 
Pennsylvania Association of Staff 
Nurses and Allied Professionals went 
on strike Thursday after rejecting the 
contract offer from Wyoming Valley' 
Health Care System.
The union originally planned to 
strike for two days, but about 200 
replacement nurses from US Nursing 
of Denver, Colorado, who started 
work Thursday, were hired for 10 
days - resulting in an eight-day lock­
out.
Private guards surrounded the hos­
pital Saturday while nurses demon­
strated and walked the picket line. 
“It’s like Fort Knox. I’ve never seen so 
much security in my life around 
here,” said registered nurse Sharon 
Shewczyk.
At a rally later that Saturday, more 
than 2,500 people packed a hall in 
nearby Plains Township, carrying 
signs and giving hugs and words of 
encouragement to the nurses.
The current dispute involves 
salaries, staffing a nd mandatory 
overtime, but nurses said their griev­
ances go back more than 10 years, to 
the 1992 merger of General with the 
now-shuttered Nesbitt Memorial 
Hospital in Kingston.
They said the Wyoming Valley 
Health Care System, the hospitals’ 
parent company, spent millions of 
dollars buying properties and 
expanding and renovating General 
Hospital while laying off workers and 
increasing workloads.
“They kept taking more and more 
and more away from us,” said 
Carolyn Gazowski, who worked at 
General and Nesbitt before quitting 
two years ago. “They took away our 
clothing allowance, our Christmas 
bonus. They took away our birthday 
holiday.”
“They had money for imported 
marble and this and that and the 
other thing, but they didn’t have 
money for their work force,” she said.
Murder witness’s 
testimony is false
WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) — A wit­
ness in the homicide trials of two men 
said he lied in his testimony and 
alleged he was pressured to do so by 
Washington County’s district attor­
ney after being charged with drug 
possession.
Last week, Kenneth Jackson also 
alleged that someone impersonating 
him testified at the trial of one of the 
men seven years ago. Testimony cred­
ited to Jackson was key to the convic­
tions of Lawrence Barnes and Rodney 
Yarbor in the death of Robert Hannen 
in July 1992.
Hannen died of injuries sustained 
in a beating at his home. The state 
Superior Court ordered a new trial 
for Barnes after allegations were 
raised that witnesses at his trial may 
have lied and it was shown that 
Jackson was in jail when Hannen was 
beaten.
Horse-cloning is 
university’s hope
BATON ROUGE, La. (U-WIRE) 
— Cloning has been a hot topic in 
national news recently after 
cloning company Clonaid claimed 
to have cloned the first human 
baby in the world. However, ani­
mal cloning experts at Louisiana 
State University seem to have 
mixed opinions about human 
cloning.
Professors Richard Denniston 
and Robert Godke in the 
AgCenter’s Department of Animal 
Sciences are researching the 
cloning of cattle, goats and horses. 
Their primary goal is to clone a 
horse, which has never been done.
The department has been able to 
clone nearly a dozen animals so 
far. The actual cloning is not taking 
place on campus, but at the 
Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory 
located at the St. Gabriel Research 
Station in St. Gabriel, Louisiana.
Denniston said that the depart­
ment is studying animal cloning 
because it provides a valuable tool 
to increase the reproductive effi­
ciency of agriculturally and bio- 
medically valuable animals.
The School of Veterinary 
Medicine has been collaborating 
with the AgCenter on this 
research. The Vet School assists 
them by delivering the cloned off­
spring they have produced and 
helping them with the reproduc­
tive research of the animals.
So far, scientists have succeeded 
in cloning sheep, mice, cows, pigs,
rabbits, goats, and cats. Both 
Clonaid and an Italian fertility doc­
tor, Severino Antinori, have 
claimed they cloned humans, but 
neither has shown any solid proof.
Table manners 
course hits home
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (U-WIRE) — 
“As little ships go out to sea, I push 
my spoon away from me,” said 
Agnes Doody, professor of commu­
nications at the University of 
Rhode Island, to more than 100 
members of the senior class. 
Doody led the class through a four- 
course meal, including difficult-to- 
eat delicacies like French onion 
soup and Cornish hens, at the 
annual Career Week etiquette din­
ner Friday night.
“Order items that will not chal­
lenge you,” Doody said. 
“Spaghetti, for example, is not a 
good choice.”
Diners most often make table 
gaffes by talking with food in their 
mouths and reaching across the 
table without asking, she said. 
Doody enlightened the diners with 
some little-known rules of eti­
quette. She told students to always 
pass the salt and pepper together 
even if a person only asked for one 
of them. If a potential employer 
becomes too friendly, Doody rec­
ommended being bold and saying, 
“We’re not going there.” If the 
other person has food on his face, 
Doody suggested gently saying, 
“You need your napkin.”
Doody also told tales of past din­
ing disasters, from ordering three 
different potato dishes to knocking 
over glasses while gesticulating.

Philanthropy to be 
recognized at CMU
The H. John Heinz III School of 
Public Policy and Management at 
heralds the arrival of its Regional 
Leaders Scholarships, a new scholar­
ship opportunity awarded to appli­
cants who have exhibited a commit­
ment to the Pittsburgh community. 
Interested applicants can learn more 
on Monday, February 10, at 5:30 pm, 
at the Regional Enterprise Tower, 425 
Sixth Avenue, 23rd floor, where the 
Heinz School will hold an informa­
tion session to dialogue about the 
scholarship, as well as part-time 
degree offerings.
“The Heinz School is taking the 
lead with this scholarship because we 
believe in supporting activism in our 
own community,” said Jeffrey 
Hunker, dean of the Heinz School. 
“It’s also an opportunity to enrich the 
lives of our fellow citizens in the com­
munity, by actively seeking out and 
encouraging fresh approaches to 
problem-solving.”
Some of the scholarships will pro­
vide full tuition for admitted appli­
cants. Participation in programs such 
as the Leadership Development 
Initiative, PUMP (otherwise known 
as the Pittsburgh Urban Magnet 
Project), the ONYX Alliance, 
Pittsburgh Young Professionals, 
Ground Zero, as well as various com­
munity outreach activities. 
Volunteerism and participation on 
nonprofit boards typify the type of 
work that will be recognized through 
this award.
CMU sprawls into 
Singapore schools
CMU has agreed to use its 
resources in information technology 
systems and business to help the 
Singapore Management University 
(SMU) enhance its recently-estab­
lished School of Information Systems
(SIS), with initial emphasis on an 
undergraduate business program.
The four-year pact between the 
University and SMU calls for CMU to 
share its most advanced methods 
with SIS’s undergraduate program, 
its master’s and executive education 
programs and to the establishment of 
a research center.
“Carnegie Mellon brings a wealth 
of educational experience, not only in 
technology and business programs 
for which it is renowned, but also in 
diverse disciplines such as fine arts, 
psychology, philosophy and biologi­
cal sciences,” said Steve Miller, SIS’s 
interim dean. “SMU recognizes the 
value of providing our students with a 
cross-disciplinary educational experi­
ence. With this partnership, our abili­
ty to deliver such a cross-disciplinary 
experience will be greatly enhanced.”
It is no coincidence that Miller and 
CMU are so happy to scratch one 
another’s backs — he is no stranger 
here. He holds a PhD in Engineering 
and Public Policy from Carnegie 
Mellon, and is a former faculty mem­
ber of the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration (GSIA).
Joining Miller for the signing of the 
memorandum of agreement were 
CMU provost Mark Kamlet, electrical 
and computer engineering depart­
ment head Pradeep Khosla and GSIA 
professor Tridas Mukhopadhyay.
CMU will work alongside SIS to 
develop the undergraduate program 
curriculum, faculty resources, and 
organizational and technological 
infrastructure. The university will 
similarly share its expertise with 
regards to the planning, design and 
launch of the research center and the 
master's program.
Both parties hope to expand the 
relationship in other areas, such as 
the facilitation of student exchange 
programs, technology-related execu­
tive education programs and confer­
ences, seminars and symposia on top­
ics of mutual interest.
“We are excited about the opportu­
nity to assist in the development, of 
the new School of Information 
Systems at Singapore Management 
University,” Kamlet said.
Kicked off the beaten track
Mysterious construction underneath the Morewood E-Tower breezeway has been hassling students, faculty, and 
staff for days, especially those who frequent the well-worn path of Devonshire Road.
this country is the result of poverty 
and ignorance.
“You can't keep a patient healthy 
who is ignorant,” Elders said.
Elders stressed that health educa­
tion needs to become a concern 
among community leaders and needs 
to be taught within the schools.
Elders, who cited obesity as one of 
the primary causes of diabetes, said 
that 65 percent of the population is 
overweight, 25 percent of children 
are overweight and 40 to 50 percent 
of minority women are obese.
According to Elders, this means 
that “black women are far more likely 
to have diabetes because there is 
more obesity.” She argued that the 
media has the resources to reach peo­
ple but they do not do it.
“Other countries do it,” Elders said.
This is the reason diabetes is the 
seventh leading cause of death in this 
country and the third leading cause 
of death in minority communities, 
according to Elders.
Elders asked the audience if they 
have seen the meals their children are 
receiving in school.
Elders said with 25 million chil­
dren eating reduced or free lunches, 
the United States needs to reintro­
duce health education and exercise 
into the schools at the kindergarten 
through 12th grade level.
By bringing this information into 
the schools, Elders said parents will 
learn, too.
Elders added that beyond health 
education, access to health care 
needs to improve.
Approximately 44 million people in 
the country are living with no health 
care and, as a country, the United 
States is ranked 54th in the world 
when it comes to health care provi­
sions, according to Elders.
Elders said that she once told for­
mer President Bill Clinton, when he 
was still governor of Arkansas, “It is a 
lot easier to train a bus driver than it 
is to train a doctor.”
By improving public transporta­
tion, the problem of health care 
accessibility is being dealt with, 
Elders explained.
Elders called out to doctors, busi­
ness owners, educators, and leaders 
within the community to create 
change and to make the community 
healthier and combat the issue of dia­
betes.
She said those within the commu­
nity must initiate change.
“You’ve got to be involved and 
knowledgeable about the community. 
You can’t teach those people if you do 
not know where they are coming 
from.”

Pitt student’s killer 
brought to justice
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE) — On 
January 16 of this year, Kenzi Snider 
was indicted in South Korea on the 
formal charge of killing through 
injury, according to the Council of 
Legal Affairs at the Korean Embassy 
in Washington.
Last October, a West Virginia judge 
found sufficient evidence and proba­
ble cause to extradite Snider, the for­
mer Marshall University student. 
Snider is accused of murdering 
University of Pittsburgh student 
Jamie Lynn Penich in 2001.
An anonymous source at the 
embassy said that assuming Snider 
was formally arrested in South Korea 
in mid-December, she will be tried in 
a district court in mid-May.
This is in accordance with South 
Korean law, which states that a per­
son must be tried within six months 
of their arrest.
The charge of killing through 
injury is the equivalent to a second- 
degree murder charge in the United 
States. The embassy source explained 
that the charge implies that the inten­
tion was not to kill, only to injure, but 
death resulted. If found guilty, she 
will be sentenced to three to 15 years 
in a South Korean prison, according 
to the embassy source.
The source also added that if the 
district judge finds Snider innocent of 
all charges, the prosecution would 
have the opportunity to appeal the 
decision and Snider could potentially 
face a second trial. In the event that 
such an appeal is denied, Snider 
would be free to return to the United 
States, the source said.
Ex-surgeon general 
calls for education
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE) — Former 
Surgeon General Dr. Jocelyn Elders 
called for “education, education, edu­
cation.”
Speaking Wednesday at a UPMC 
sponsored luncheon held in Alumni 
Hall about diabetes awareness, Elders 
expressed the urgent need for dia­
betes education within communities 
across the United States.
Elders, who never visited a doctor 
before attending college, cited that 
the primary reason diabetes has 
become such a widespread issue in
Crime & Incident
Field Stop, 1/24/03, 6:33 am — 
Two CMU Police officers responded 
to a call reporting a male sleeping on 
a couch on the mezzanine level of 
CFA. They were met by the caller, a 
“Dave” of Miller Electric. He escorted 
the officers to the couch, where they 
woke the sleeping man. He stated 
that he was a CMU student and had 
been working in one of the practice 
rooms, when it had gotten so late that 
he fell asleep. After presenting his 
Chile ID card (his CMU one was lost), 
it was confirmed that the male was a 
student at CMU, but that he is not 
currently enrolled for the spring 
semester. The officers told the still 
groggy male that until his status at 
the university became more clear, he 
would be known to the officers as 
trespassers. He was told not to return 
unless he had specific business at 
CMU.
Medical, 1/25/03,12:30 am — A
male student reported to a dispatcher 
that he had hurt his shoulder by 
falling off a rail in Doherty House. 
One officer responded, to find CMU 
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
treating the student. He had been 
“trying to show off’ by sliding down 
the wooden stair rail, whereupon his 
pants caught on the rail causing him 
to fall off and hit his chest and shoul­
ders on the concrete floor. After EMS 
left, an officer transported the stu­
dent to UPMC Presbyterian.
Disorderly Conduct, 1/26/03, 
12:20 am —Two CMU police officers 
on fraternity patrol were approaching 
the driveway of area 7 when they saw 
city police officers and a group of 
unknown white males congregating 
on the lawn in front of Delta Upsilon 
fraternity house. According to a city 
officer, a group of men had been 
pushing and shoving each other and 
rolling on the lawn in front of Delta 
Upsilon. After speaking to the men, 
the officers understood that the tiff 
had begun when a male had punched 
a Delta Upsilon male in the right eye, 
causing him to lose a contact lens. 
The Delta Upsilon brothers con­
firmed that the unknown male had 
become combative when he was 
denied entry into a fraternity party by 
the brother who was punched in the 
eye, who had been carding guests. 
The Delta Upsilon brother stated that 
if the identity of his assailant became 
known, he did not wish to press 
charges.

sure that they are on the right path,” 
he said.
Howard described the process for . 
creating a new chapter as a formal 
procedure.
Once seven undergraduate stu­
dents are inducted into Kappa Alpha 
Psi in Carnegie Mellon University’s^ 
own Beta Epsilon chapter, the group 
will be able to petition Pittsburgh’s 
alumni of Kappa Alpha Psi for the- 
right to form the Beta Epsilon chapter 
of the fraternity at Carnegie Mellon 
University.
The Pittsburgh alumni will then 
consider whether to send Carnegie 
Mellon’s application on to the frater-' 
nity’s national headquarters.
There, the decision will become 
final, and the new Kappa Alpha Psi 
chapter will be free to seek accep­
tance in the Interfraternity Council at 
CMU.
“The addition of a new fraternity at 
Carnegie Mellon will give students 
more access to cultural, social, and 
philanthropic activities. The more 
organizations, the more opportuni­
ties for a student to find and join the 
one that’s best for him,” said Kenton 
Kline, president of the Interfraternity 
Council, a board that supervises fra­
ternity relations at Carnegie Mellon 
University.
“Bringing Kappa Alpha Psi to 
Carnegie Mellon brings an added ele­
ment of diversity. The history and cul­
ture of historically black fraternities 
and sororities is very rich,” said 
White. 1
“This history, tradition, and culture- 
wili manifest itself through the pro­
gramming that the Beta Epsilon chap- ’ 
ter will be doing on campus and in 
Pittsburgh,” he said.
Although Kappa Alpha Psi is a his­
torically African American fraternity, 
it seeks to recruit all men of color.
While looldng forward to starting 
the new fraternity chapter, the three 
new members of Kappa Alpha Psi 
acknowledge that they are not in of 
rush and would rather take their time 
and be successful in their endeavors 
to start a prosperous and vigorous 
chapter at Carnegie Mellon* 
University.

Columbia shuttle crash investigated
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - 
Just before it disintegrated, space 
shuttle Columbia experienced an 
abnormal rise in temperature and 
wind resistance that forced the craft’s 
automatic pilot to make rapid 
changes to its flight path - possible 
evidence that some heat-protection 
tiles were missing or damaged, NASA 
said Sunday.
Engineers began assembling a 
grim puzzle from debris recovered in 
Texas and Louisiana, and disclosed 
computerized data showing that the 
unusual events before Saturday’s 
accident occurred in the wheel well 
atid fuselage on the left side of the 
shuttle - the same side hit by a piece 
of fuel-tank insulation during the 
launch 16 days earlier.
Shuttle program manager Ron 
Dittemore cautioned the data was 
preliminary but said the combination 
of events and data suggest that the 
thermal tiles that protect the shuttle 
from burning up during re-entry may 
have been damaged on Jan. 16.
! “We’ve got some more detective 
Work. But we’re making progress inch 
by inch,” Dittemore said, adding 
engineers are trying to extract 32 sec­
onds more of computerized data 
from the doomed spacecraft.
As engineers pinpointed the exact 
satellite locations of debris, Robert 
Cabana, director of flight crew opera­
tions at the Johnson Space Center, 
said remains from all seven of the 
astronauts had been found. Later,
Cabana said in a statement that he 
had been misinformed and that 
NASA could not confirm that remains 
from each of the astronauts were 
recovered.
Dittemore said earlier in the mis­
sion, NASA had aggressively investi­
gated the possible effects of the 
impact from the fuel tank’s foam 
insulation and concluded “it did not 
represent a safety concern.”
“As we gather more evidence, cer­
tainly the evidence may take us in 
another direction,” he said.
Dittemore said the engineering 
data showed a rise of 20 to 30 
degrees in the left wheel well about 
seven minutes before communication 
was lost with the spacecraft.
Then there was a rise of about 60 
degrees over five minutes in the left- 
hand side of the fuselage above the 
wing, he said.
On the right side, the shuttle tem­
perature rose the normal 15 degrees 
over the same period, he said. All the 
readings came from sensors under­
neath the thermal tiles, on the alu­
minum hull of the craft.
The temperature rises were fol­
lowed by increased drag on the 
spacecraft that caused its automated 
flight system to adjust its path, he 
said. The adjustments were large 
enough that “we have never seen it to 
this degree,” but still were within the 
shuttle’s capabilities, he said.
Communication with the shuttle 
was lost soon after. “It was if some­
one had cut the wire,” Dittemore 
said.
The left side of the spacecraft has 
been the focus of suspicion almost 
from the start.
Investigators are focusing on 
whether a broken-off piece of foam 
insulation from the big external fuel 
tank caused damage to the shuttle’s 
left wing during liftoff Jan. 16 that 
ultimately doomed the flight 16 days 
later.
The manufacturer of the fuel tank 
disclosed Sunday that NASA used an 
older version of the tank, which the 
space agency began phasing out in 
2000. NASA’s preflight press infor­
mation stated the shuttle was using 
one of the newer super-lightweight 
fuel tanks.
Harry Wadsworth, a spokesman 
for Lockheed, the tank maker, said 
most shuttle launches use the “super­
lightweight” tank and the older ver­
sion is no longer made.
Wadsworth said he did not know if 
there was a difference in how insula­
tion was installed on the two types of 
tanks.
Dittemore said the tank, though no 
longer manufactured, had been used 
for many years and was between 
6,000 and 7,000 pounds heavier than 
the newer version, but “we had no 
reason to doubt it capability.”
Earlier Sunday, NASA administra­
tor Sean O’Keefe named a former 
Navy admiral to oversee an indepen­
dent review of the accident, and said 
investigators initially would focus on 
whether the piece of insulation 
caused the damage that brought 
down the shuttle.
“It’s one of the areas we’re looking 
at first, early, to make sure that the 
investigative team is concentrating 
on that theory,” O’Keefe said.
The insulation is believed to have 
struck a section of the shuttle’s left 
side.
O’Keefe emphasized that the space 
agency was being careful not to lock 
onto any one theory too soon. He 
vowed to “leave absolutely no stone
‘V
unturned.”
For a second day, searchers 
scoured forests and rural areas over 
500 square miles of East Texas and 
western Louisiana for bits of metal, 
ceramic tile, computer chips and 
insulation from the shattered space­
craft.
State and federal officials, treating 
the investigation like a multi-county 
crime scene, were protecting the 
debris until it can be catalogued, 
carefully collected and then trucked 
to Barksdale Air Force Base in 
Louisiana.
The effort to reconstruct what is 
left of Columbia into a rough outline 
of the shuttle will be tedious and 
painstaking.
When a shuttle piece was located 
this weekend, searchers left it in 
place until a precise global position 
satellite reading could be taken. Each 
shuttle part is numbered; NASA offi­
cials say experts hope to trace the 
falling path of each recovered piece.
The goal is to establish a sequence 
of how parts were ripped off 
Columbia as it endured the intense 
heat and pressure of the high-speed 
re-entry into the atmosphere.
At least 20 engineers from United 
Space Alliance, a key NASA contrac­
tor for the shuttle program, were dis­
patched to Barksdale for what is 
expected to be a round-the-clock 
investigation.
Other experts, including metallur­
gists and forensic medicine special­
ists, are expected to join the investi­
gation. Their focus will be on a micro­
scopic examination of debris and 
remains that could elicit clues such as 
how hot the metal became, how it 
twisted and which parts flew off first.
In addition to NASA’s investiga­
tion, O’Keefe named an independent 
panel to be headed by retired Navy 
admiral Harold W. Gehman Jr., who 
previously helped investigate the 
2000 terrorist attack on the USS 
Cole.
Gehman’s panel will also examine 
the Columbia wreckage, and come to 
its own conclusions.
O’Keefe described Gehman as 
“well-versed in understanding exact­
ly how to look about the forensics in 
these cases and coming up with the 
causal effects of what could occur.”
Columbia came apart 200,000 feet 
over Texas while it was streaking at 
more than 12,000 miles an hour 
toward the Kennedy Space Center. A 
long vapor trail across the sky 
marked the rain of debris.
Leases cut due to declining conditions

CMU professor participates in Bush’s Washington tax summit
by Jeannie Choi
Staffwriter
In President Bush’s State of the Union 
address last Wednesday, he said that his bud­
get would support three great goals for 
America: to win the war, to protect our home­
land, and to revive our economy.
Drastic tax code changes are an integral part 
of the budget’s attempt to generate revenue for 
the government.
But before touting his tax plan’s effective­
ness to the American people, Bush consulted 
15 leading economists from around the nation 
to discuss both his new tax plan and his domes­
tic program, including Allan Meltzer, a profes­
sor of political economics in GSIA.
“Every political presidential policy has peo­
ple who are for it and people who are against it, 
and this president is trying to do something
with his domestic tax policy that is not imme­
diately attractive to large numbers of people,” 
said Meltzer.
“He wanted to get comments from people, 
but he also wanted our support.”
This closed-door meeting, which took place 
last Tuesday at the White House, was the first 
of several events planned to rally support for 
the new plan, which increases income tax cuts 
and decreases cut taxes on dividends.
Meltzer said this is a bold step on Bush’s 
part.
“Presidents, at least from the time of 
Franklin Roosevelt, have recognized that there 
was a problem with the double taxation on div­
idends and capital gains,” said Meltzer.
Double taxation occurs when a company 
pays a stock owner dividends every year.
These are taxed twice, once when the com­
pany is taxed, on its earnings and once when 
the owner of the stock pays taxes on his or her
income.
Meltzer foresees double taxation as present­
ing a problem.
“This distorts the way in which corporations 
use their earnings because when dividends are 
taxed so heavily, corporations don’t like to pay 
out money in dividends so they keep the earn­
ings and use them to buy other companies, not 
always with great foresight.”
The legislation passed would encourage cor­
porations to pay out the dividend money and 
let investors decide how it’s going to be used by 
investing it somewhere else or spending it 
appropriately.
The controversy surrounding this attempt at 
a 10-year, $364 billion plan to end the taxation 
of dividends is testament to the magnitude of 
this proposed legislation.
Meltzer believes that the effects of this plan 
will benefit all Americans within the next ten 
years.
“The main advantage of the program is that 
it makes a long term structural reform that 
most economists have advocated now for a 
very long time, going all the way back to 
President Roosevelt,” said Meltzer.
“Now President Bush has decided that he’s 
willing to handle the controversy and to get 
this legislation passed,” he said.
Many students are chagrinned about the 
proposed changes.
“That’s what they do — they raise taxes,” 
said Ashley August, a first-year civil engineer­
ing major, “and then, in a year, it starts to catch 
up with them, so they cut them. They raise 
them, they cut them, and then what? Then is 
he going to dump it on the next president?”
“It didn’t sound like [Bush] had a good intu­
ition of money in American families,” said 
Dawn Butler, a sophomore biology major, “Not 
when he was talking about it on TV. He was 
just reading from a sheet.”

Crumbling confidence
Above: a ceiling in Cathedral Mansions apartment before repairs. Exposed pipes and falling 
plaster were left above the kitchen of Mark Egerman (computer science, history and public pol­
icy, ‘04) for months. University Housing is cutting 46 percent of its leases with Cathedral 
Mansions because of the building’s declining condition.

the last few years. The ovens in some 
efficiencies do not work correctly and 
have not been fixed by the landlord. 
Additionally, the building itself is 
beginning to show its age and is 
becoming much more costly to rent to 
students.
Initially, Housing had looked at 
removing leases from London Terrace 
Apartments. However, because the 
landlord there has been much more 
willing to work with Housing 
Services in making renovations, 
Housing has retained those leases. 
Recently, the basement was remod­
eled, air conditioning was installed, 
and windows were replaced at 
Housing’s request.
Though Housing Services currently 
leases around 65 percent of 
Cathedral Mansions, Roberta Cox, 
the landlord, was not willing to make 
the capital improvements Housing 
Services desired. Cox was not avail­
able for comment.
“The building is dated,” said 
Michael. “It is not keeping up with 
the standards of other off-campus 
[accommodations].”
Michael said that the plans of the 
building’s owners were heading in 
one direction and that Housing’s 
hopes and expectations for the build­
ing were heading in another.
Michael also said that he under­
stands the landlord’s position and 
acknowledges that she is likely to find 
leasees for the apartments without 
making any improvements to the 
building. Cathedral Mansions has 
always been popular with students
because of its close proximity to cam­
pus.
Accommodations in Saxony 
Apartments will no longer be offered 
to undergraduate students either, 
but Housing’s concerns with Saxony 
are different from those it had over 
Cathedral Mansions. Housing 
Services only has one year left on its 
lease of the building and plans to 
lease the apartments directly to 
graduate students for the remaining 
year. After that year, the building 
will be removed from the housing 
system.
Students who reside in apart­
ments that will not be leased will be 
given the option of renting directly 
from the landlord or participating in 
the Special Selection portion of 
spring room draw.
During Special Selection, resi­
dents will be able to select a room of 
the same classification in another 
building.
“I like the building and I’d like to 
remain here next year, but I’d prefer 
not to have to rent directly from the 
Cathedral Mansions management,” 
said first-year engineering student 
Kathryn Smith.
Another resident, James Salvia,
will move to another off-campus 
apartment through the Special 
Selection process. The sophomore 
ECE student thinks his room is quite 
small and is not fully satisfied with 
the kitchen facilities in the apart­
ment.
“Next year I would like to live in 
Fairfax or Shady Oak apartments,” 
he said. “My room [in Cathedral 
Mansions] is too small.”
Because it is impossible to predict 
the exact number of students who 
will seek to remain in campus hous­
ing, Housing Services does not know 
if all the leases will in fact be can­
celled.
“It will be bad for us to get [the 
displaced residents] back in campus 
housing,” said Michael.
During room draw, Housing will 
track the preferences of current resi­
dents and, if necessary, continue 
some of the leases in the buildings. 
Michael could not predict how many 
leases would be retained, or whether 
those leases would be in Cathedral 
Mansions or Saxony Apartments.
Housing Services expects to know 
by the second night of room draw 
how many apartments’ leases will in 
fact be terminated.

Elijah Dobrusin, junior mechanical engineering major, speaks his mind at a Student Dormitory Council town meeting, the 
purpose of which was to vote on University smoking policy. The motion to change the policy was eventually tabled.
Smoking discouraged by task force
ANTI-SMOKING, from page A1
The task force proposal is being 
reviewed by SDC, and further dis­
cussion has been tabled for the next 
meeting.
“It’s a huge issue which won’t be 
summed up too quickly,” said Ken 
Herman, SDC president. “At this 
point, we can’t see where it’s going. 
Both sides have voiced strong opin­
ions.”
In conjunction with the proposal 
to make all campus housing smoke 
free, the Staff Council has also initi­
ated a campaign of their own along 
similar lines.
“We want to enforce the 20-feet 
rule not only on housing but also on 
all campus buildings,” said Madelyn 
Miller of the Environmental Health 
and Safety Department. “Employees 
do not want to walk through a cloud 
of smoke every time they enter a 
building.”
And the majority of students 
agree: 81 percent of students sur­
veyed believe that all campus build­
ings should be smoke-free.
According to the smoking policy 
draft that the Staff Council is work­
ing on, smoking will not be permit­
ted within 20 feet of any entrance to 
any CMU facility, air intake, or 
ground-level office. Smoking will 
also not be permitted indoors since 
many offices share the same air han­
dling system.
The City of Pittsburgh Ordinance 
states that the rights of smokers end 
when their actions affect the com­
fort and well being of others. If non- 
smokers feel that their rights are 
being violated, then their desires 
supercede those of the smokers.
“The ordinance is fairly stringent, 
and we’re aligning our policy to 
that,” said Miller. “It does not say 
anything about accommodating des­
ignated areas for smokers.”
However, in order to appease 
smokers who might feel that the new 
policy is an infringement on their 
rights, ideas for a designated area 
are in the works. Ashtrays which are 
currently located right in front of 
many building entrances will be 
relocated.
“I can see it from both sides,” said 
Troy Cox, a first-year smoker whose 
major is undecided. “But it’s more of 
a hassle for smokers to move than it 
is for the second-hand smokers. It 
seems like they’re taking too strong 
of a step.”
Smokers are not the only ones to 
feel that the new policy will be too 
strict.
Shilpi Chakrabarti, a first-year CIT 
nonsmoker, says that she has never 
had a problem with smokers in 
dorms and those who smoke right in 
front of a building’s entrance.
“It doesn’t make sense to suddenly 
make all housing smoke-free and 
enforce a 20-feet policy; it actually 
seems unfair to push the smokers 
away, especially in cold weather,” 
she said.
The Staff Council will take their 
new policy to the Faculty Senate and 
then to the President’s Council for 
approval.
The task force has also made a rec­
ommendation to Entropy to recon­
sider their practice of selling ciga­
rettes on campus.

Database tracks international students

foreign visitors aren’t tracked,” said 
Krieg. Additionally, Krieg said it is 
unclear how the INS will have the 
capacity to ably use all of that infor­
mation.
Senior Euijoong Kim, a Korean 
graduate student studying civil engi­
neering, said focusing on internation­
al students as a means to root out ter­
rorists is not very useful.
“[The INS] is focusing on the 
wrong people. They’re using their 
efforts in the wrong place,” said Kim.
“How much [of the information] is 
going to be shared and used used by 
other agenecies, universities, or even 
credit card companies?” wonders 
Rakesh Chitradurga, a first-year MBA 
student.
According to Krieg, most changes 
due to the new database are occur­
ring at an administrative level and 
will not impact students.
The system will, however, affect 
the flexibility the Office of 
International Education has to coun­
sel foreign students on some matters.
“Some of the shades of grey, as to 
the interpretation of federal law, are 
gone,” said Krieg.
For example, if a foreign student 
wants to drop from full-time status to 
part-time, they are required, and 
have always been, to consult with 
their OIE advisor.
If a student drops courses through 
their academic advisor without first 
contacting the OIE with their deci­
sion, they could lose their student 
visas.
Paper documentation allowed OIE 
advisors time to counsel students 
who dropped from full-time to part- 
time even after the fact, said Krieg.
“Now, if a student makes an acade­
mic choice to drop below full-time 
and then they come to inform us 
later, there are fewer ways we can 
advise that students on how to get out 
of the consequences,” she said.
According to Krieg, if international 
students are aware of the regulations 
and follow them, as nearly all do, 
there won’t be any problems.
First-year student Panuakdet 
Suwannatat, a computer science
major from Thailand, said the new 
SEVIS system is just a more efficient 
way to track foreigners.
Christian Iniguez, a sophomore 
computer science major from Mexico, 
said the database will probably bene­
fit both the INS and foreign students 
by making the documentation 
process easier.
The new system just means less 
paperwork, said Veronica Urenda, a 
junior business and economics major 
from Bolivia.
“If you don’t have anything to hide, 
you shouldn’t have a problem with 
it,” she said.
Suwannatat said the kind of infor­
mation the INS requests now is 
understandable, but he would not 
like to see INS request more personal 
information on students, such as the 
clubs or activities they participate in. 
He doesn’t see that happening, how­
ever.
“If the objective is to keep tabs on 
us, it’s understandable from a safety 
perspective,” said Iniguez. “As long as 
that information is not used in any 
malicious way.”

member. If his add-on proposal is 
approved, which he will learn some 
time this month, his work will focus 
on “looking at portable electronic 
devices and risks to commercial air­
lines,” said Florig.
Morgan supports the idea that 
independent analysis can be a more 
effective way to reach unbiased con­
clusions.
“They don’t have an axe to grind. 
They don’t have a strong position as 
to what the answer is,” he said of the 
MacArthur Foundation.
Morgan sees one significant benefit 
to all of this work.
“The biggest result will be a bunch

and issues, and not driven by the

New club will sponsor 
foreign policy lectures
by Pam Carney
Junior Staffwriter
The International Policy Club 
(IPC) held its first meeting on 
January 28 at 9 am in Hamburg 
Hall.
Alejandro Ruiz-Acevedo, a master 
student in the Heinz School, found­
ed this club because, he said, most 
students on campus were not fully 
aware of governmental issues in 
places like Iraq, Europe, and Latin 
America.
“There really wasn’t very much 
international awareness here, on 
CMU’s campus,” said Acevedo, “But 
September 11 really seemed to open 
minds.”
Although the club is sponsored 
and run out of the Heinz School, all 
students are welcome.
“This club is open for everyone; 
everyone should be benefited by our 
work,” Acevedo said.
The International Policy Series 
(IPS), a lecture series designed to 
increase interest and club member­
ship, is the club’s chief public offer­
ing.
The next IPS event will be on 
February 21, from 12:30-2 pm in 
McConomy Auditorium.
Mr. Y.R. Isar, former director of 
the United Nations Educational 
Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) Cultural Policies for 
Development, is scheduled to speak 
about the evolution of cultural 
development, Ruiz-Acevedo said.
The club hopes to book a speaker 
from World Bank to participate in 
the lecture series soon.
Kowalski, a public policy and 
management masters student who 
worked in the Peace Corps, looks 
forward to getting involved with the 
club.
“We’re going to bring lots of peo­
ple to educate CMU to be conscious 
about the international world,” said 
Kowalski.

Wardriving is hobby for some, exploit for others Local Pittsburgh startup
In late 1968, Douglas Engelbart 
and his colleagues at the Stanford 
Research Institute demonstrated a 
prototype computer system that 
they had been developing. Crafted 
from luxurious-looking wood, the 
simple analog device had two 
wheels on the bottom, oriented at 
right angles. One turned when the 
device went forward and back­
ward, the other with side-to-side 
motion. These movements were 
interpreted by the computer, 
which would then move a cursor 
on the screen replicating the user’s 
movement of the device. Engelbart 
had invented something that we all 
take for granted today: the mouse. 
You are using one right now if you 
are looking at this article on the 
web. But in 1968, computer tech­
nology was still beyond the reach 
of all but universities and large cor­
porations, and innovations that 
would take advantage of a graphi­
cal pointing device did not yet 
exist. Engelbart’s invention, the 
result of a scientific analysis of the 
pros and cons of other potential 
pointing devices, would be denied 
its chance to revolutionize comput­
er interfacing for over a decade. 
Inspired by mouse-equipped proto­
types at a Xerox research center, 
Apple Computer introduced the 
Lisa computer in 1983. Like the 
more successful Macintosh that 
followed it, the Lisa used a revised 
version of Engelbart’s mouse con­
cept. Rather than having the two 
rollers contact the desk surface, 
the Lisa’s mouse used a ball 
between the desk and the rollers.
This design provided smoother and 
more accurate, and eventually 
became the faithful companion of 
every PC sold today.
The traditional mouse uses a ball 
to operate rollers that do the same 
thing the rollers on Engelbart’s 
prototype did, but they work very 
differently. The rollers on that first 
mouse of 1968 adjusted variable 
resistors (potentiometers) that the 
computer could use to detect 
mouse movement. The modern 
approach to this design uses the 
rollers to turn wheels with holes in 
them, which you can see if you take 
a mouse apart. An LED (light-emit­
ting diode) shines light on one side 
of the wheel onto an optical sensor 
on the other side. As the wheel 
turns in response to mouse move­
ment in a given direction, the holes 
in the wheel break up the light 
from the LED into a pulse that the 
optical sensor can read, from 
which the computer can determine 
how fast the mouse is moving on 
that axis.
The traditional ball-and-roller 
mouse has its drawbacks, as you 
are surely well aware. The ball eas­
ily collects grease and dirt from the 
desk surface and transfers it to the 
rollers, which get partially 
jammed, making the mouse diffi­
cult to use. And the balls do not roll 
consistently on some surfaces, 
making a mouse pad necessary. 
People became aware of these 
problems early on, and in the late 
1980s, a solution was developed — 
the optical mouse. With no moving 
parts, the optical mouse promised 
to make Engelbart’s ergonomic

As CMU students can attest, the 
advent of wireless technology pro­
vides both a benefit and a luxury for 
those desiring Internet connectivity. 
However, the type of wireless system 
that the university uses is not limited 
to the campus: 802.11b wireless net­
work technology is slowly becoming 
ubiquitous, finding its place within 
eateries, corporations, and homes. 
With this spread and the advantages 
wireless connectivity offers, an 
underground movement has risen 
up, based on discovering which net­
works are secured and which are 
not. For the people looking for 
access, most wireless networks are 
unsecured and have rapid connec­
tions to the Internet, allowing any­
one within range fast, free access 
with the unsuspecting provider foot­
ing the bandwidth bill and never 
being the wiser.
When wardrivers detect wireless 
networks, they note their locations 
and security levels — whether the 
networks are open or secured. The 
equipment usually used for wardriv­
ing includes a laptop, wireless card 
and/or antenna, and software that 
detects wireless networks and their 
degree of security. Such software, 
like NetStumbler, MacStumbler, and 
Boingo, is available for almost all 
systems, from Palm handheld 
devices to Mac OS X.
Wardriving was first developed 
and the term coined by Berkeley, CA, 
resident Peter Shipley, who first 
automated the process of roaming 
about looking for open wireless net­
works using dedicated software and 
a global positioning system (GPS). 
Shipley’s goal was to make wireless 
network operators aware of the secu­
rity risk an open network poses and 
inspire the use of non-trivially-bro- 
ken encryption on sensitive net­
works. When Shipley first started 
wardriving, Wired Equivalent 
Privacy (WEP), the main wireless 
security measure, was used on 15 
percent of the networks Shipley 
found; one year later, 33 percent of 
networks used WEP encryption.
Chris Marshall, a freshman in CIT, 
began wardriving during high school 
in Washington, DC, and says, “While 
wireless technology is fantastic, not 
everyone who uses it knows about 
the proper ways to make it secure. 
Wardriving helps raise awareness 
that if sensitive information is travel­
ing across or is connected to a wire­
less network, it is the network opera­
tor’s responsibility and duty to 
implement adequate security mea­
sures.”
Of course, not everyone has the 
same noble goals as Shipley — some 
bandwidth hounds just want to be 
able to get on a network wherever 
they go. As a result, communities 
dedicated to sharing wireless access 
maps of well-populated areas in the 
United States and around the world 
have developed. Sites such as 
www.wifimaps.com and www.wardriv- 
ing.info provide user-submitted maps 
and community discussion areas.
However, because of the expense 
of GPS systems, a new aspect of 
wardriving known as warchalking 
has developed. Using a language of 
chalk marks on the sides of build­
ings, sidewalks, telephone poles, and 
so on, warchalkers signify where 
wireless access points are located, 
their identifications, and whether 
they are open or closed. This lan­
guage of cryptic symbols and short­
hand is a direct descendent of the 
ideas of the hobo language of the 
Great Depression, where vagabonds 
used similar markings to indicate 
important facts about the environ-
invents virtual keyboard

A stylus is a small pen-like rod that 
allows users to input data into their 
personal digital assistants, or PDAs. 
Enthusiasts of these small electronic

board with you wherever you go, a 
keyboard made of lasers, lights, and 
cameras.
Steve Montellese, chief technology 
officer and founder of Virtual 
Devices, currently has two prototypes 
for a virtual keyboard. The first proto­
type uses a slide projector to shine the 
image of a keyboard onto a flat sur­
face. Two cameras gauge the depth 
and horizontal placement of the 
hands as they play along the “key­
board,” and an optical laser helps to 
provide a reference point for the 
cameras. A computer takes the visual 
data and converts it to keystrokes 
using a type of stereoscopic vision 
similar to what people use to attain 
depth perception.
The smaller prototype uses essen­
tially the same technology, except in 
a smaller single-unit package, 
though this version too is a far cry 
from a final product’s refined design.
The company wants to package the 
final unit into something similar to a 
fat marker one could carry in their 
pocket, or in a device such as a cell 
phone or PDA. Montellese said the 
future is in this kind of wearable 
hardware, with computer screens in 
eyeglasses, a keyboard at the tip of a 
pen, and a CPU inside a phone.
Montellese’s offices are still filled 
with remnants of his other company,

The second prototype built by Virtual Devices Inc. is more refined but is still being 
debugged. Eventually, the idea is to reduce the package to the size of a fat marker.
Kohta Asakura/Art StaffGame system mods are tempting to enthusiasts
by Dain Pascocello
Contributing Editor
In the shifting oceans of innova­
tion, there will always be pirates. 
New technologies are constantly 
being incorporated by the question­
able elements among us. However, 
not every breakthrough deserves a 
stigma. In the world of video-gaming, 
home consoles have been subject to 
years of a growing culture of modify­
ing — modding for short — that has 
extended the lives of some systems, 
granted greater playability to others, 
and spawned a cottage industry of 
modder materials. Unfortunately, the 
main element of this practice appears 
to be piracy.
The first real breakthrough for 
modders and console modding dates 
back to the original Sony Playstation 
home system. Gamers were able, for 
a fee and a few spare parts, to obtain 
a system, that, once modified, could 
either play European and Japanese 
imports or run copied or “burned” 
media, such as CD-R’s. The result was 
a much more multi-faceted machine, r-
and a potential legal problem. 
Current copyright laws prohibited 
the playing of burned or pirated 
material on consoles, with punitive 
penalties to insure that offenders 
don’t attempt the practice a second 
time.
But the easy availability of so- 
called “mod chips”, those tiny, but 
immeasurably important devices that 
“unlock” the machines, was — and is 
— still too much for some to resist. 
One of the aspects of modding is the 
relatively little expense involved.
“It’s a thing that’s extremely eco­
nomical for pirates,” said Eric Parent, 
a CMU graduate. “When you can buy 
a five-to-ten dollar mod chip, a 22- 
gauge hook-up wire for two bucks, a 
ten-dollar soldering iron, and one 
dollar’s worth of electrical tape, and 
get to have access to almost any game 
you want, for a lot of people, it’s an 
incitement to steal.”
Armed with a simple screwdriver 
and an internet connection to down­
load instruction materials, it appears 
that even your most tech-phobic 
great-uncle could be modding in no 
time.¦<
The “Modding for Dummies” 
theme has continued apace today, 
with hackers and pirate organiza­
tions forming internet “guilds,” 
forums, and discussion sites in order 
to further perfect their trade. Many of 
these also involve game-modding, a 
close cousin of the console modifying 
phenomenon. In game-modding, 
bells and whistles, as well as more 
advanced maps, character “skins,” 
and weapons are added by indepen­
dent programmers. The modified 
extras are then normally posted on 
the Internet, as is the case for mod- 
heavy PC games like Half-Life, or 
added alongside emulators, which 
allow users to play console games on 
a computer platform, for the video 
game variety.
-“It’s incredible the lengths people 
will go to, given free creative rein,” 
said Jacob Nicholls, another recent 
graduate of Carnegie Mellon. “A lot 
of the [new] stuff that you read about 
is completely revolutionary, in terms 
of gameplay and user interface. Of 
course, you also have your fair share 
of garbage when it comes to mod­
ding.”
\
Today, modders currently focus the 
majority of their attention on 
Microsoft’s XBOX and the Playstation 
2. Consequently, so have their respec­
tive development teams, as the com­
panies continually attempt to stay 
one step ahead of piracy. Some, like 
Bill Gates’ Microsoft, have even taken 
on former hackers and pirates as 
teams to try to thwart a new genera­
tion of would-be modders.
Not every pirate, however, appears 
to be after public bounty. Some mod­
ding techniques and tricks were 
developed specifically as a way to 
challenge the hardware and try out 
some personal tinkering.
“Many people will mod a console 
to be able to develop homebrew pro­
jects,” said Shaheen Ghandi, a senior 
ECE major. “For instance, Dreamcast 
Linux was a direct result of console 
modding.”
Video game industry executives, 
like PC makers before them, now 
seem resigned to live in the modders’ 
world. They know, as most CMU stu­
dents do, that imagination and cre­
ativity — like piracy — are essential 
components of our tech world.

revolution as reliable as the rest of 
the computer. These early optical 
mice used a special mouse pad that 
had a reflective surface with a very 
tiny grid printed on it. A highly 
focused light in the mouse shined on 
the mouse pad, and bounced back to 
an optical sensor only if it was 
between the lines of the grid. As the 
mouse moved around on the grid, 
the way that the light was or was not 
reflected back to the sensor enabled 
the sensor to determine how fast the 
mouse was moving, and in which 
direction. You may never have seen 
one of these early optical designs, 
because they were very expensive. 
They also had to be kept aligned cor­
rectly with the special mouse pad or 
they did not work properly.
While those ancestral optical mice 
used essentially the same optical 
mechanism to track movement that
ball-and-roller mice use, and merely 
eliminated the ball and the rollers 
from that process, the affordable 
optical mice that emerged in 1999 
took things to a whole new level. 
The new mice do not need a special 
mouse pad; they do not need a pad 
at all.
The new mice see the surface they 
are traveling over and tell the com­
puter how fast and in which direc­
tion they are moving, even if you lift 
them a few millimeters off the desk. 
An LED shines on the surface, but 
rather than picking up the reflec­
tions with a mere digital sensor, they 
have what is essentially a tiny cam­
era to watch the movement of the 
desk surface. Specifically, it is a 
Complimentary Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor (CMOS), the same 
type of image sensor that has made 
digital cameras more affordable in 
recent years. The signal from the 
mouse’s camera then goes to a
Digital Signal Processor (DSP), a 
specialized chip that is also used in 
high-end audio/visual hardware.
The DSP interprets what the 
CMOS sees to determine the speed 
and direction of mouse movement, 
on almost any surface, and sends the 
appropriate signal to the computer, 
just like a traditional mouse would. 
Some recent models have even 
included two optical sensors to 
improve accuracy and fix the jitter 
sometimes associated with single­
sensor mice when the cursor is left 
sitting still.
Computer manufacturers have 
made great strides in improving the 
user’s experience since 1968, when 
most people had never even seen a 
computer. Now that the mouse on 
your desk can see where it’s going 
better than a mouse in the sewer, the 
next step will be to develop a revolu­
tionary technology to recycle all of 
our old mouse pads.

Millennia 3, a company that applied 
visual technology to the measuring 
of jam in Fig Newtons and to check­
ing Heinz ketchup packets for leaks, 
among other things.
“The good news [in that field] is 
every application is new and innova­
tive,” said Montellese. “The bad 
news is every application is new and 
innovative.”
He said Millennia 3 made decent 
money but never really took off, so 
he decided to focus very narrowly on 
a product he knew would be useful 
in addressing a certain problem.
“PDAs will never replace laptops 
because you can’t type on them,” he 
said.
Montellese said his company had 
planned to have a product on the 
market by now, but due to the econ­
omy and the possibility of an 
impending war, the necessary 
money hasn’t been there.
Virtual Devices isn’t unique in its 
pursuit of an optical keyboard, 
though perhaps Custer would agree 
they are the firstest with the 
mostest, since Montellese said his 
company’s patents cover all designs 
and that one of his competitors has 
already signed a licensing agree­
ment.
And perhaps it’s no surprise that 
Montellese chose the line of work 
he’s in. Hanging from his walls are
large swords of mythic proportions. 
The reason for these, as given by an 
avid Star Trek fan and a man who 
calls science fiction writers the
nrnnliol-c rvf t-Vi o fnhiro* aT lib-o
swords. Someday, I will answer the 
door and there will be a dragon 
there. And I’ll need it.”
He was only kidding.
Virtual Devices Inc.’s first keyboard prototype uses two cameras and an optical 
reference laser to determine the positions of the hands using the keyboard. The 
keyboard is projected using a standard slide projector.
Microsoft software protects copyrights

Assistant Science & Technology Editor
Most of the people crowding the 
Carnegie Science Center this week­
end came for PirateFest, but some 
stayed to see the “Tissue Engineering 
for Life” planetarium show about 
bone tissue engineering. After ten 
minutes of starting and stopping, 
while the announcer apologized for 
“technical difficulties,” the Henry 
Buhl, Jr., Planetarium darkened, 
stars came out, clouds drifted across 
the sky-dome, and the show began.
It told the story of how regenera­
tive medicine is used to heal bone 
fractures. Most of the time, the bro­
ken limb will be set in a cast for about 
six weeks, and the bone will heal on 
its own. But sometimes, a bone may 
be broken too badly for the tradition­
al method to work - there may be too 
much space in the break for the bone 
to repair itself.
In such cases, a scaffold is built and 
“young cells” are taken from the 
patient’s body. Those cells are then 
grown in a laboratory until there are 
enough to cover the scaffold, and the 
entire structure is inserted into the 
area within the break. These young 
cells first become cartilage, and then, 
in the presence of calcium, harden to 
form bone. Eventually, using the scaf­
fold, the bone will grow back and 
heal.
“Tissue Engineering for Life” is 
filled with animations of cellular and 
tissue structures, cells whizzing 
through tunnels, and background 
music with occasionally weird sound 
effects. The computer-generated 
naked woman who was used to illus­
trate different parts of the body drew 
comments of “Ew!” from a little boy 
and “Skinny! She needs to eat,” from 
one man.
Much of the two years of work put 
into the show was accomplished by 
people affiliated with Carnegie 
Mellon University. STUDIO for 
Creative Inquiry Fellows John 
Pollock and Robert Hoggard served 
as director and principal artist, 
respectively.
Dr. Pollock said that the show was 
designed for people as young as 
fourth graders, but with no upper age 
limit. Because of the demographic of 
the Carnegie Science Center, the 
team tried to make it interesting to all 
ages. “We want everybody to have a 
good time and learn something,” he 
said.
Also from CMU, Center for Light 
Microscopy and imaging Scientific 
Director Daniel Farkas was the 
show’s executive producer.

With the music industry scram­
bling to stop piracy, technology com­
panies have sprung to the rescue with 
methods for protecting media con­
tent. On January 20, Microsoft offi­
cially announced the release of 
Windows Media Data Session 
Toolkit, a means for putting protect­
ed music files onto audio CDs.
A session is the name given to a 
segment of data burned onto a CD- 
R/RW. A CD may contain many ses­
sions. This new software allows a 
media company to record two ses­
sions on a CD — the first session 
would contain standard CD audio, 
and the second session would con­
tain Microsoft’s copy-protected 
Windows Media Audio files. Most 
audio CDs do not use the full capaci­
ty of a CD; depending on album 
length, they may use around 500 
megabytes — which leaves 150 
megabytes or more for the second 
session to hold Windows audio files.
The audio files can be played on 
any computer or portable device 
equipped with Windows Media 
Player. According to Microsoft, there 
are 450 million computers and 
portable devices worldwide with 
Media Player installed.
In order to listen to the music on 
the second session of the CD, the 
music owner must obtain a license to 
access the content. Media companies 
can include the license on the CD, or 
it can be downloaded online. At this 
time, only Windows Media Player 7.0 
or higher for the PC can access the 
license on the CD. Software earlier 
than 7.0 and all Macintosh versions 
will have to obtain a license through 
an Internet connection.
Microsoft’s Windows Media Data 
Session Toolkit may offer a solution 
to the problems with current CD copy 
protection.
Most CD protection technologies 
available now use methods to distort 
or change the CD audio data on the 
disc so that the music cannot be 
copied on a computer. However, con­
sumers have complained that these 
schemes often make the CD inopera­
ble on computer CD drives, car stere-
L._C_„Di®rorum
os, and portable devices.
Microsoft’s design allows a CD to 
be played on normal CD players 
through the first session of the CD, 
which contains standard CD audio, 
and on computers and portable 
devices using Windows Media Player 
to play the second session of the CD.
“It’s a solution for record compa­
nies instead of blocking CDs from 
computer use,” said Erin Cullen, 
product manager for the Windows 
Digital Media Division.
Since the Windows Media digital 
rights management only protects the 
files on the second session of the CD, 
it remains the music company’s 
choice whether or not to copy-protect 
the first session CD audio.
The new technology also gives 
record companies more freedom to 
adopt new distribution methods and 
set protection options on music. 
Second session content could include 
extras such as bonus tracks or artist 
interviews, and the audio files could 
also be offered for download online. 
Content companies can specify the 
length of time or number of play­
backs for which a license is good. 
This gives them the ability to rent 
music for a certain time period or to 
give out trial or demo copies.
The software includes options for 
the content owner to revoke access to 
a file. This gives record companies
Bum Lee/Art Editor
the ability to take away music from a 
customer if the license period has 
expired or if they believe that the 
music owner is violating copyright 
law.
A number of companies are 
already taking advantage of 
Microsoft Windows Media Audio 
files. Pressplay, an online music ser­
vice partnered with Microsoft, has 
licensing contracts with all five major 
music labels. Although the availabili­
ty of popular music has been a prob­
lem in the past, Pressplay says that it 
is no longer a problem. The company 
has over 100,000 songs available, 
including music from groups like 
Aerosmith, Eminem, U2, Incubus, 
Coldplay, and Britney Spears.
“Availability of music is becoming 
far less of an issue than it ever has 
before,” said Seth Oster, vice presi­
dent of corporate communication 
and affairs at pressplay.
Online file-sharing programs such 
as Kazaa, which allow the illegal 
exchange of music, remain a problem 
for the music industry. The 
Recording Industry Association of 
America continues to pursue legal 
action against distributors of copy­
righted material.
“As more and more people under­
stand the value [of Pressplay], there 
will be more of a migration to legiti­
mate services,” said Oster.

Propaganda drug commercials 
insult viewers’ intelligence
A 40-something woman stares at a 
pregnancy test on a table. A man we 
assume to be her husband paces back and 
forth with a look of consternation on his 
face.
An advertisement for a pregnancy test­
ing kit during the Super Bowl? Sex sells, 
but during the world’s biggest testos­
terone-laced event next to the Running of 
the Bulls, sex is buxom women wrestling 
in a fountain over some water-downed 
imbibe.
This couple isn’t about to have a child. 
No, they are about to become the 
“youngest grandparents on the block.” 
Their teenage daughter is pregnant 
because she puffed before she huffed. The 
voice-over warns us, “marijuana can 
impair your judgment.”
The 30-second spot, sponsored jointly 
by the White House’s Office of National 
Drug Control Policy and the Partnership 
for a Drug-Free America, cost just under 
$2 million. On the Super Bowl commer­
cial laugh-o-meter, it was money well 
spent.
But for only an extra $200, drug czar 
John Walters could have learned in an 
introductory statistics class at his local 
community college that correlation does­
n’t mean causation. Simply put, it was just 
another ridiculous salvo in the irrational 
and failing War on Drugs (a US 
Department of Health and Human 
Services study found that 88.5 percent of 
high school seniors said that obtaining 
marijuana is “fairly easy” or “very easy”).
Fear is a great motivational tool. For 
centuries, churches and religions used it 
to keep their flocks from straying. 
Coveting thy neighbor’s wife? Going to 
hell.
Now a democratic government resorts 
to instilling fear in teenagers and their 
baby boomer parents, who indubitably 
inhaled during their formative years. 
Smoking marijuana? You’re bound to get 
pregnant, shoot your buddy with a .38, or 
run over a cycling pre-teen outside a
drive-thru restaurant.
Despite over 15 years of such federally- 
endorsed anti-drug ads, including last 
year’s outlandish campaign claiming that 
marijuana smokers help support terror­
ism, people aren’t buying it.
According to a study conducted by the 
University of Michigan released in 
December by the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse, marijuana use by 10th 
graders dropped only 2.4 percent from 
32.7 percent to 30.3 percent during the 
last year. Cocaine and heroin use by 10th 
graders remained stable at 4 percent and 
1 percent, respectively. Crack usage sky­
rocketed 30 percent from 1.8 percent to 
2.3 percent.
Weed clearly remains American 
teenagers’ drug of choice. Yet by focusing 
anti-drug advertisements primarily on 
marijuana, the government is overlook­
ing the constant, if not rising, use of sig­
nificantly more dangerous and addictive 
drugs by adolescents.
Blinded by widely contested evidence 
that marijuana is a “gateway” to drugs 
like cocaine and heroin, the government 
is essentially putting all of its eggs in one 
basket with its current fear-based ad cam­
paign.
It may be unprincipled for the federal 
government to spend $180 million of tax­
payers’ money each year to tell you how 
to live your life - especially on such an 
incredulous campaign - but it is a telling 
sign that public support for government, 
prohibition of an innocuous substance is 
waning.
If rational discussion of national drug 
policy is trumpeted by fear-inducing 
images and sound bytes with little real 
impact, then it is only a matter of time 
before rational minds put an end to the 
ineffective War on Drugs. But if past gov­
ernment performance is any indication, 
then other scandalous practices, like the 
drinking of alcohol and the copulation 
between the sexes, will be prohibited 
first.
RIAA should be held accountable 
for information network trespass
In our courts, long-standing questions 
of diversity standards and the right of 
choice demand answers.
The Recording Industry Association of 
America (RIAA) will force another item 
onto the crowded and worthy ballot of 
the high court, one mixed with questions 
of information sanctity and the common 
right of personal privacy.
The RIAA undermined the first widely- 
used peer-to-peer (P2P) network to grace 
the world, the infamous Napster which 
was brought to its knees in a beheading 
that went largely unopposed. The record­
ing industry cried theft, obscuring impli­
cations of information destruction and 
the question of what exactly was being 
stolen.
Springing up from the ashes of their 
predecessor, Kazaa, Gnucleus, Gakster, 
and other file sharing programs prolifer­
ated. For the stalwart RIAA, the battle 
continues along the front of higher edu­
cation, as they instruct colleges to moni­
tor their internal networks for copyright 
violations even as they scan the down­
loads across P2P networks like Kazaa. 
However, the question may not be one of 
the right of the RIAA to spy, but of the 
necessity of their very existence. Who 
needs the record industry when informa­
tion is distributed without cost across vast 
distances? Who needs to have a CD 
pressed when one can just burn them 
yourself for a fraction of the cost? MP3s 
are more versatile, work on a plethora of 
electronic devices, and easily trans­
portable.
The RIAA stands dead and obsolete, yet 
it flails at a peripheral issue to ignore the
facts. In desperation, the RIAA com­
pounds its assault by flooding false and 
corrupt data across the P2P networks, like 
a wounded movie villain eager to get off 
that last shot and kill Schwarzeneger.
Carnegie Mellon should support a class 
action suit by its students against the 
RIAA for breach of privacy and inconve­
nience. CMU is a Mecca of network 
research in the country, and the 
University cannot in good conscience 
stand with an organization that uses 
methods of data corruption to destroy 
information networks. CMU need not 
kowtow to worthless and intrusive 
demands.
The huge, unwieldy recording industry 
quavers in these times, awaiting just the 
right outcry from the students, because 
despite our apathy the RIAA has brought 
the fight to us.
This information destruction is a terri­
ble omen.
If privacy is not enough, then students 
can easily empathize with private artists 
whose work is lost in a pit of corrupt data, 
lost forever from the willing and wanting 
ears of fellow humans.
The recording industry is afraid now 
because we do not need their packaging 
or shiny labels. The yoke of the prepared 
CD has been thrown off, and new and 
innovative solutions lie ahead to govern 
what one person can really own. 
Companies will package and distribute, 
but the circled C must diminish in size.
Students around the country, all collec­
tors of information, must protest these 
restrictions. The problem lies not in the 
technology, but in the ideals.

Football coverage has 
belligerent sensibility
Dear Editor,
Football in its essence is about brutal 
competition; I dare say that either a Raiders 
or Bucs enthusiast would corroborate your 
peachy view of “what this game is all about,” 
not to mention the world of Super Bowl 
watchers motivated not by some esoteric 
American “love of the game,” but by the 
point spread. The event brings the country 
together, perhaps, but in the spirit of oppo­
sition. It's no accident that football has been 
used in almost every art medium as a war 
metaphor. It's actually a nice dose of poeti- 
cism that the protest was scheduled for the 
weekend of such a financially motivated,
ideologically barren event that endorses the 
fervor of mob mentality.
It’s injurious to throw around terms like 
“blasphemer” in a dammit-I-have-three- 
cases-of-cold-beer-in-my-backseat-and- 
need-to-make-the-Santana-pre-game-at- 
the-frat-get-out-of-the-street way. What 
about the “blaspheming” six million football 
fans contributed to some of the worst traffic 
San Diego has seen since the last Super 
Bowl? The term implies a violation of some­
thing sacred and I’d argue that dismissing 
the constitutional right of Americans to 
raise their voices by peaceful democratic 
means is just that. This weekend provided 
an incredibly positive outlet for so many of 
the Pittsburgh community who oppose the 
impending war. To ignore, or worse, to pity 
such efforts seems to be symptomatic of the 
self-centered apathy that allows such unjus­
tified excesses of this administration to hap-*pen.
For one who gives continuous credit-to 
our “great nation,” I would think you would 
keep in higher regard the American respon­
sibility to make the constituents’ wishes 
heard. I like watching football - it provides 
a warranted release from the real world, 
September to January. But in response to 
the sentiments expressed in your columr}.: I 
fear you, I fear your supportive audience, 
your blind and empty enthusiasm, your dis­
dain for informed and peaceful activism. 
And I “pity the fools” who associate, of the 
two events taking place this weekend, one 
of the biggest commercial rip-offs and cul­
tural low-points of the year as the greater 
tribute to our “great nation.”

The National Parks Service needs to loosen up

Like a spewing geyser, backlash over a Metamucil commercial has 
erupted into the media spotlight. A laxative so familiar to my fami­
ly, especially to my father, has prompted comical opposition to its 
manufacturer's irresponsible ad that defaces a national treasure. 
According to Metamucil’s official web site, “Metamucil is a bulk 
fiber laxative for treating occasional constipation and restarting 
regularity.” The site adds that the “active ingredient is psyllium 
husk,” a natural plant fiber.
The company produced a commercial in which a park ranger 
pours the medication into Old Faithful Geyser at Wyoming’s 
Yellowstone National Park. The implication is that the geyser spews 
out regularly as a result of this unnatural addition.
The toilet humor of the commercial appeased a 15-year-old boy in 
many viewers but infuriated the National Parks Service. 
Yellowstone superintendent Suzanne Lewis told The New York Times 
that the suggestion that Old Faithful doesn’t function naturally was 
“disconcerting.”
Kenneth Anderson, manager of a state park in Minnesota, was 
likewise troubled by the commercial, according to The Times. He 
placed the despicable association of a natural wonder with a drug in 
order to sell the drug in the same league as “when people sell nam­
ing rights to sports arenas and when we hear that some even pro­
pose naming rights to the Golden Gate Bridge.”
The quarrels with the commercial stem from its promotion of
wrongful behavior and disrespect toward our national parks. 
Recognition that geysers erupt naturally seems like common sense, 
but of a trivial importance that doesn't warrant such backlash. The 
commercial isn’t even correct: with eruptions ranging from 45 min­
utes to two hours apart, Old Faithful is far from regular!
The more severe consequences are the physical damage to gey­
sers and hot springs that the ad may spark, and the perils to

Dancing about architecture: Ground zero design -
resistance to change. This pattern of devel­
opment is not uncommon - planners divide 
the development sites into small sections, 
turn them over to developers, and bring in a 
team of experts: interior planners, construc­
tion companies, retail consultants, attor­
neys, and construction agencies. Finajly, 
they involve architects, though often from 
completely unimaginative real-estate firms. 
Architecture was so much left out of the pic­
ture that all sorts of bogus ideas formed, 
namely the cruel side effect of democracy 
that says one person’s taste is as good as 
another’s.
Scrapping the immediacy of concrete 
plans, Phase II was designed as a study pro­
ject - the LMDC requested submissions 
from seven design teams, some of which 
integrated several international firms. From 
the nine plans submitted that were until 
Sunday on display at the Winter Garden in 
the World Financial Center, the LMDC rec­
ommended on Friday two plans as finalists: 
the museum-based memorial of Berlin- 
based Studio Daniel Libeskind and the inter­
national THINK team’s World Cultural 
Center.
Approval of finalists is expected today, 
following a meeting of LMDC representa­
tives, the Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey, Governor George Pataki, and 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The Port Authority and the LMDC are 
expected to craft a final land use plan in 
February, utilizing footprints of the design 
chosen in this second round. Libeskind’s 
design retains the walls of the World Trade 
Center’s basement as a memorial space 
(half of which would only be open to rela­
tives of those killed in the attacks) leading 
from a new museum, leaving the Twin

At a convocation two weeks after the 
2001 World Trade Center attacks, architect 
and Parsons School of Design professor 
Michael Sorkin remarked, “we’ve been hear­
ing for years about architecture as event 
space. Here is an event. What now?” 
Architecture has never suffered from lack 
of legend or humanization. From the begin­
ning, it has been about social history. The 
project to construct a commercial center, 
transport hub, and memorial attracted sub­
missions from not only architects at major 
international firms, but from artists, stu­
dents, academics, and the public wondering

what is to happen now.
The civilian contest is most intriguing: 
from all over flag-waving, red-blooded, 
corn-fed, America, potential memorial 
designs poured in. It is a pompous and 
nationalistic gesture that bleeds stars and 
stripes and that reeks of superficial senti­
mentality. Yet a lack of understanding of the 
detail of the geologic, commercial, and 
emotional effects on New York City does not 
dissuade them.
In this era of art as therapy, we can still 
indulge the fantasy to redesign as part of 
mourning: it asks how one would do it if one 
could do it again.
The Lower Manhattan Development 
Corporation (LMDC) first requested Phase I 
submissions from a real estate developer in 
July. All proposals were scrapped and uni­
versally loathed for their sameness and

Technology encourages emotionally inept to exist without faces
If you really want to know how your 
friends are feeling, you shouldn’t ask 
them; you should look at their away 
messages. Chances are you’ll get an 
answer closer to the truth. People 
really open up when they’re sitting in 
front of a computer screen.
It’s a natural but disturbingly com­
mon phenomenon: students turn to E- 
media to express their feelings, living 
in dorms where newfound freedom 
meets unlimited Internet access.
The Internet is a convenient, effi­
cient, and relatively risk-free forum 
for communication. E-mail, Instant 
Messenger, and web diaries are safe, 
faceless zones where there are no 
consequences for emotional outpour­
ings.
The appeal of online communica­
tion is understandable; it’s easy to be 
forthcoming when you talk through a 
keyboard, when you have time to edit 
your thoughts, and when there’s no 
one else in the room to talk back. You 
can cleanly achieve cyber-catharsis 
without ever having to come in con­
tact with another human being.
The web journal, or ‘blog,’ a medi­
um that simultaneously and shame­
lessly caters to human innate 
voyeuristic and exhibitionist desires,
is a particularly striking form of tech- 
no-emotion.
Not every-web journalist is neces­
sarily socially inept — far from it — 
and many use the Internet as a pro­
ductive outlet for creative thought. 
But more and more people turn to 
maintaining online diaries as their 
sole form of expression. Sites like 
LiveJournal.com are magnets for 
brooding, self-pitying adolescents 
and young adults, the kind that listen 
to emo music until their hearts break 
and bleed all over their keyboards.
Though some of the gut-wrenching 
emotional confessions on sites like 
these can be entertaining, it’s distress­
ing when the author is a friend.
It’s frustrating for me to think that 
some of my closest acquaintances 
would rather speak to me through a 
website than directly to my face.
This kind of covert exhibitionism, 
this ‘techno-emotion,’ is advancing to 
unhealthy extremes. Some people 
divide themselves into separate 
online and real-world identities, ones 
that are not easily reconciled. 
Someone who is generally vocally 
uncommunicative will become an 
open book for AOL buddies.
People seek emotional validation 
by sharing their deepest dreams and 
sentiments in the form of away mes­
sages. One person I know left love 
poems for me in his AIM profile; his 
plan backfired, and I lost a lot of 
respect for him. Not only did I see his
pseudo-advances as a cop-out from 
true interpersonal relationships, but 
also as a socially backward simulation 
of emotional fulfillment.
It’s sad that our generation is losing 
its ability to be straightforward with 
one another. Our interpersonal skills 
have been irrevocably crippled by our 
addiction to the web.
Just around the corner is 
Valentine’s Day, another bloody vic­
tim of the techno-emotional sledge­
hammer. Hallmark.com reports that 
last February 14 was the busiest day 
in their history; 2.9 million web 
. surfers chose to say, ‘I love you’ by way 
of E-card. In 2002, over 88 million E- 
cards were sent through 
Hallmark.com alone.
That means that 2.8 cards were 
sent every second that could have 
been put to better use: making a per- 
son-to-person phone call, giving a 
hug, taking the time to write a real let­
ter.
Love should not be a matter of con­
venience. It might take more effort 
and more courage, but to say, ‘I love 
you’ means so much more than to 
type it.
Dependence on technology per­
vades all spheres of human life. For all 
the good that it might do for business, 
education, and beyond, it has stunted 
interpersonal development; it pro­
vides a cowardly alternative to 
putting true emotions on the line. 
Despite good intentions, no E-card, no
web journal, no Instant Message 
will ever sufficiently satisfy the 
innate human need for real contact 
and communication.
Considering how widespread the 
trend of techno-emotion is, it’s hard 
to tell whether it’s reversible or not.

University athletics must not use Title IX as overarching authority
Ask an average citizen what he or she knows 
about Title IX and usually the answer will come 
back that it’s a law regarding gender equality in 
collegiate athletics. In fact, Title IX of the 
' Educational Amendments of 1972 is a blanket 
"anti-discrimination doctrine controlling all 
Aspects of educational life, from admissions to 
"Social organizations to financial aid and most 
recognizably, athletics.
The athletic implication of Title IX is that all 
secondary and post-secondary schools receiv­
ing federal financial support, nearly every such 
institution, must provide athletic opportunities 
and funding for each sex proportionally to its 
enrollment. The unfortunate reality is that 
even with the federal funding, every college 
and university is not able to fund every sport, 
and schools must cut desired men’s programs 
when they cannot afford the required, parallel
- women’s program.
This is not to say that I am in favor of the 
exclusion of women from sports or any other 
facet of collegiate life. Much to the contrary, I 
enjoy attending sporting events for both sexes. I 
believe that equality or proportionality can be a 
good system if desire warrants it. And I feel that 
women should be given every opportunity.
The main problem with Title IX is that it can 
often force schools to give scholarships and 
funding to women’s sports programs only in 
existence to keep the men’s sports alive. If 
women want to play, we have to insure that 
they can.
While I appreciate women’s participation in 
the athletic sphere, if universities are only sup­
porting women’s athletics to keep their men’s 
teams off life support, then it is a distortion of 
the law. If men want to play in greater ratios 
than women, we have to let them too,.
The only other option given to colleges look­
ing for compliance with the law is to needlessly 
cut men’s sports. Since 1972, 100 men’s gym­
nastics programs and 400 wrestling teams have 
been cut. But the cut that brought Title IX com­
pliance into national concern was the 1997 
elimination of Terrier football at Boston
University after more than 90 years of inter­
scholastic competition.
Football has often been a linchpin in Title IX 
enforcement. There is no female equivalent to 
football, in participation or popularity, in rev­
enue or required funding. A popular saying 
among athletic administrators is that there are 
actually three divisions of collegiate athletics: 
“male, female, and football.”
Subsequently, universities often face the ulti­
matum of eliminating their highly funded foot­
ball teams or several of their minor men’s sports 
teams instead.
Because of revenue, schools often choose the 
latter, leaving women with more sports from 
which to choose, but with equal total funding. 
Carnegie Mellon avoids this problem with dis­
proportionate male enrollment, which allows 
them to have football unbalanced.
With this balance already in place, the 
Department of Athletics must add opportuni­
ties equally for each sex. Women’s participation 
in sports proves that Title IX is effective. The 
number of female collegiate athletes has grown 
steadily since 1972 and no end to the growth 
can be foreseen soon. Still, prospective male
athletes are greater in number than their 
female counterparts, yet they cannot take 
advantage of any extra opportunities, which 
were eliminated in the name of gender parity. 
The Department of Education engaged in yet 
another Title IX study this week. It is expected 
that the law will neither be repealed nor 
altered, but will change the way it is enforced.
Title IX cannot be an iron fist in educational 
governance. The government should protect 
women’s rights to participate, but not with 
restrictions so imbalanced that even our 
nation’s female athletes admit them to be 
unfair. It is not proportionality and percentages 
that dictate fairness in athletics. It is opportuni­
ty for the talented to play the sport of their 
choice. The only number we should give any 
weight is 100 percent. That’s the amount of ath­
letically ambitious students who should be able 
to participate in their schools’ varsity programs, 
regardless of the actions of their intergender 
counterparts.

Just last week I saved a life. It was a robin - 
'Orange, puffy, lying still - and apparently the 
bird had fallen out of a nearby tree onto the 
: ¦ sidewalk, near a stretch of road along my 
"route to school. Presumably it was ill (the bird 
was off its migratory clock, and hadn’t flown 
south) and semi-seriously injured (a large 
lump adjacent to its right eye, obstructing its 
vision, was probably the work of a stone or 
crabapple tossed at it). The robin, dazed, 
smallish, was sitting here on the concrete in 
danger of being trampled by even the most 
alert of pedestrians. A couple of minutes 
passed and having reacted little to a 200- 
pound gadfly in winter boots nudging it along 
the cracking, ice-slicked cement, the bird 
began to worry me. I called animal control. 
Stay with the bird, they said. But I’ve got to 
get to class. Does the animal appear injured, 
sir? Yes, but I really have to be going; send 
«someone by, okay? Sir, it’s in the animal’s best 
?interest if there is somebody there to monitor
it, to look after it until we can help. Alright, I’ll 
see that no one hurts it or steps on it; I’ll be 
here when you come. And it was like that until 
several minutes later when the animal control 
veterinarians arrived and thanked me for 
doing a decent and humane thing; it was per­
haps as if the robin had owed its life to me.
But of course it wasn’t true then and it 
remains untrue now that a bird’s life wasn’t 
“owed” to me. I failed to protect any sort of 
“rights” that the animal might have had - 
instead, I conferred them upon it, judiciously 
and with an eye to prudence. Without my 
intervention (or that of some other halfway 
decent soul) that bird may not have lived. Any 
“rights”, or autonomy, or imprescriptible 
value claimed by activists on behalf of ani­
mals has never been; their lives hang in the 
balance, but for our actions to protect them 
and prevent extinction. Yet animals still suf­
fer. In nature and in the hands of humans, 
animals endure heartbreaking cruelties. But 
species still thrive, and live comparatively 
happier lives, thanks to man.
Like most families, I had a dog. He was 
well-loved and even more well-fed and 
enjoyed a long, happy life. We found him 
upstate, in a woody New York kennel where 
you could purchase any breed, save for the
100-pound plus-size models, for around 20 dol­
lars. At 45 pounds by age three, he was a bargain. 
We named him (and this is still curious.to me, 
being as we are a Catholic household) Pontius 
Pilate, after the biblical Roman minister who 
called for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Pontius 
Pilate - Pilate, for short - was a beautiful, sleek 
animal, and we adored him like a member of the
Bum Lee/Art Editor
family. It crushed my mother to finally see him 
die, and we all suffered some psychic wound 
because of his passing. I caught myself, several 
months after he had succumbed to stomach can­
cer, still checking the spot where he haid lain, 
routinely, just outside our back door, every time

Compassion and animal rights United States pushes for unethical war
ANIMALS, from page All
I stepped out onto our porch, on my way to 
school or work. We all wished, as my moth­
er hoped, that he was in a better place and 
free from the small, fierce dramas of mortal 
life. Heaven, maybe? No, probably not. 
Pilate was dead; as dead as a doornail, just 
like Dickens had said. But the point is his life 
was immeasurably improved by our having 
taken him in. We gave him an existence that 
nature, in its stark austerity, would never 
have allowed. Loyalty and the desire to eat 
regularly - these were probably the two 
major motivating factors in his staying with 
us, his pack, for over 14 years. Nevertheless, 
a loyal friend a moral equivalency argument 
does not make, even when, as here, the ani­
mal was a beloved family pet, and not, say, a 
raccoon rummaging noisily through your 
garbage pails.
So aside from moral equivalency there is 
compassion. Taken fully, compassion can 
mean one of two things: that all animals, 
regardless of station, nuisance factor, or 
threat posed, should enjoy our care; or, that 
because man is so fit - with his soul and 
intellect, for example - compared to other 
members of the kingdom, compassion is a 
crucial counter-measure against unchecked 
cruelty.
This is the argument of Matthew Scully, 
late of the Bush White House, in his recent 
“conservative” call for animal rights, 
Dominion. The book is awash in mawkish 
imagery: Scully manages to present only the 
most horrifying aspects of the animal-
human relationship - multiplex mink farms; 
puppy mills swelling with doe-eyed canines; 
the veal calf and its short, wretched life. And 
like the calf, readers are force-fed a steady 
diet of shockers and stomach-churning 
anecdotes. Scully, a former speech writer, 
has successfully parlayed his prior occupa­
tion into a best-selling formula. As a man 
who used to teach politicians how to speak, 
he is creatively adept at offering simple solu­
tions to every problem. Factory farms? An 
outrage, a new holocaust. Hunting? 
Permissible, for the knuckle-draggers and 
the hillbillies, so long as they kill for food, 
never sport. Fur coats? Unthinkable. Scully 
bases his animal rights arguments on reli­
gion, for the most part, something I am not 
in complete disagreement with. Animals 
are, after all, more than merely sacramental 
food. Perhaps I’d be swayed more if Scully 
was a particularly pious man (which he 
isn’t), or if he got past casuistry for even a 
little while and offeredbetter, more convinc­
ing reasoning (which he doesn’t). Thus, 
Scully’s stewardship goes only so far: in our 
compassion, we should aim to respect all 
animal life, speaking ethically. But, then, 
where does this compassion stop and practi­
cality begin? Simply put, we can’t save them 
all, so we must choose to save some - we 
must place the “rights” of some animals 
above others and see to their protection. 
How might I have learned this bit of insight? 
A little bird told me.

While President George W. Bush and 
Secretary of State Colin Powell threaten to 
exercise military action against Iraq, the 
international community is organizing to pre­
vent a full-scale invasion of the sovereign 
state. Several governments, like those of 
France and Germany, have strongly con­
demned Bush’s push for a military strike. 
Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators 
worldwide displayed their opposition to the 
aggressive policies of the United States.
Why are governments and citizens alike 
expressing such stark disapproval of a war on 
Iraq? Mostly because the humanitarian 
effects of launching another invasion on Iraq 
would be devastating. Tens of thousands of 
Iraqi troops and citizens, in addition to hun­
dreds of American troops, died in the first 
Persian Gulf War. Moreover, the effects of 
depleted uranium from American missiles 
and UN sanctions have killed over one million 
Iraqi citizens. The effects of a second strike 
could be even worse, especially if Saddam 
Hussein uses the weapons the United States 
claims he is concealing.
Next, although President Bush has incorpo­
rated Iraq into his focus on the war on terror­
ism, an invasion of Iraq will not prevent 
future terrorist attacks. In fact, the United 
States has been unable to reveal any link 
between Iraq and terrorist organizations. 
Osama bin Laden himself actually considers 
Saddam Hussein an infidel. Thus, a strike
against Iraq will produce the opposite of the 
desired effect; it will incite anger and provoke 
more acts of retribution against the United 
States. Another misperception is that the 
main goal of the invasion will be to create a 
democratic government. Based on the United 
States’ past support for thè Iraqi dictator and 
the Shah of Iran, and the government’s cur­
rent support for the Saudis, Kuwaitis, and 
other Persian Gulf monarchies, democracy is 
apparently not a high priority. In addition, 
installing a democratic government by mili­
tary force often fails because the new leaders 
rarely have the support of the people.
The true primary objective of the invasion 
will be to establish a friendly regime in Iraq, 
thereby allowing the United States to have 
unrestricted access to the second-largest oil 
reserves in the world. This will drive the final 
wedge through OPEC and appease many 
major American corporations to which Bush 
is indebted.
Another reason that the President is pursu­
ing this war is to distract the American voter 
from the corporate scandals and economic 
recession long enough to secure his or her 
support for the Republicans’ reelection cam­
paign. Still, Americans will not lose sight of 
the domestic problems that face their coun­
try.
The billions of dollars that will be flowing 
into the military industry sector as a result of 
war could be better spent providing jobs, 
funding improvements in education and 
health care, or addressing other social prob­
lems. The continually increasing commit­
ment to military spending is depriving the
American citizenry of valuable social services' 
and benefiting the six giant weapons manu­
facturers.
It is not only Americans and Iraqis who will 
be devastated by the war; Israelis and 
Palestinians will likely suffer as well. In the 
first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein responded to 
American forces by striking Israel with scud 
missiles. Israel did not retaliate then, but it 
will certainly retaliate if attacked again. This 
could lead to another Arab-Israeli war and 
further complicate the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict. The destabilizing effects on the 
region could be astronomical if the United 
States leads an attack on Iraq. That is, of 
course, if the United States can amass a coali­
tion in favor of an attack. In the first Gulf 
War, over 30 states made up the coalition to 
liberate the Kuwaiti monarchy. Now, because 
of a lack of international support, the United 
States is down to eight. If only eight other 
governments agree with the current adminis­
tration’s position, surely that position lacks 
legitimacy.
Thus, the citizens and governments of a 
myriad of countries oppose an aggressive use 
of military force on Iraq for a variety of rea­
sons. The motives are immoral and impracti­
cal, and the effects will be shockingly atro­
cious. Fortunately, those who recognize 
these fundamental problems with the 
impending war on Iraq are confronting thle 
United States in protest and are being heard 
by all of the world.

Metamucil vs. Parks
GEYSERS from page A10
observers who venture too close. Tampering and vandalism have 
indeed changed some of Yellowstone’s features, such as the Morning 
Glory Pool with its less impressive hue of blue than previously her­
alded. Annual injuries of those who come into close contact with gey­
sers and hot springs include bad burns and occasional deaths.
The commercial was legally grounded, as it did not occur at 
Yellowstone or involve an actual ranger. Metamucil’s parent company 
Procter & Gamble has defended the commercial’s innocence; “Anyone 
would get it.
“It was a joke,” remarked Greg Allgood, a toxicologist and associate 
director of the company’s Health Sciences Institute, in an AP article. 
Allgood’s expertise includes a doctoral dissertation on the ther­
mophilic bacteria found at Old Faithful.
We do take advantage of our national parks and should respect 
them more; even Metamucil should reflect this spirit. We mustn’t 
revert to a time when visitors in the 1870s would insert branches and 
stones into Old Faithful to watch them be ejected.
Nevertheless, Metamucil should not be chastised too much for its 
innocent joking. Its consumers just need to realize that the irrespon­
sible laxative proudly compares itself to a geyser that spews out irreg­
ularly, dangerous to anyone with whom it comes into contact. You’re 
better off retrieving your own psyllium husk from nature.

WTC plans battle between art and commerce
ARCHITECTURE, from page A10
Towers’ footprints as relics. A grand circular walkway 
would lead around the site and into the memorial 
area. Libeskind also seeks to create the world’s tallest 
building as part of the complex: 1776 feet, adorned by 
gardens at the top of the spire. It is an elegant design, 
at ground level and from the skyline, a glass needle 
spiraling toward the sky. It also succeeds in persua­
sively bringing together the separated 1 and 9 subway 
lines and the PATH train, which ineluctably violates 
full retention of the south-tower footprint, and in 
bringing daylight.
THINK, a collaborative effort that includes Frederic 
Schwartz Architects, Rafael Vinoly Architects, and 
Shigeru Ban architects, presented three schemes. The 
first, “Sky Park” comprises 16 acres of park space that 
spirals around new buildings and the guarded foot­
prints of the Twin Towers. The second, called ‘The 
Great Room’ creates an enormous, enclosed indoor 
plaza surrounded by buildings, including a new 
tallest building in the world. The third, tthe ‘World 
Cultural Center’ selected by the LMDC, provides two 
open lattice structures into which future architects 
could install buildings. I fail to accept the model of 
this structure, however - the idea of slipping build­
ings into the twin-towered latticework makes the
building eternally scaffolded and under construction. 
It is true that perpetual reconstruction is part of a 
concept, but it is not only rather unpleasant aestheti­
cally, it shoots itself in the foot reinforcing that New 
York is always about rebuilding and, indeed, of things 
falling apart. Still, neither design really appeals to 
me, seeming at least outwardly more sixties’ space 
age kitsch than truly memorable modern architec­
ture.
Whatever elaborate design the LMDC chooses, the 
project has a long way to go. The greed-motivated 
real-estate developers insist that the designs will be 
implemented only conceptually.
“You can’t build that stuff,” said one unnamed 
developer to New York Times writer Charles Bagli the 
day after the Phase II designs were unveiled. 
Prominent developer Douglas Durst agreed that the 
final result "will resemble the conceptual plan only in 
spirit."
The real estate community is not as much interest­
ed in reviving lower Manahattan as it is in luring ten­
ants downtown, hardly considering whether one of 
the seven proposed structures has a chance to offer 
the prepared space. Officials must support a mean­
ingful development in order to prevent uninspired 
design.
If all else fails, and if shocked in the heart with a
certain need for Americana, filmmaker Richard 
Linklater discusses a 16-acre park full of free-roaming 
bison in the new short "Live from Shiva’s Dancefloor," 
where walking tour guide Timothy "Speed" Levitch 
suggests that the site be turned into a park full of 
sacred American buffalo allowed to roam upon "six­
teen acres of blazing green grass, a place for togeth­
erness, healing out loud, and spontaneous culture...in 
the middle of the park, the memorial should not be an 
inaniimate slab of stone but should have a heartbeat.;"
Is Levitch's idea really cracked? Perhaps the LMDC 
and New York’s real estate companies need to lighten 
up, to return what is organic about New York. The 
committees involved also should not be as concerned 
with retaining structure.
The great thing about New York is its somewhat 
accidental planning. Growing up downtown, I may 
initially have been impressed by the towers’ size and 
presence with juvenile awe (or just ignored them), 
the reflection of light, but in the end it was a big, 
bland rectangular prism of corporate construction.
These new configurations in reaction to spectacle 
have the potential to better the human experience, 
and not merely to reflect its vulgarity in the same way 
repeatedly.

Tartan track and field 
shines at Spartan Relays
by Dain Pascocello
Contributing Editor
With an impressive showing 
Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio, the 
Carnegie Mellon University track 
and field team continued its season- 
long success story and girded itself 
for the challenges ahead. And if 
Case Western Reserve’s Spartan 
relays were any indicator of future 
accolades, the Tartans should be sit­
ting pretty.
The men’s and women’s sides 
combined for thirteen first-place fin­
ishes and twelve second-place hon­
ors on their way to a banner day. 
Bob Barton, a senior, shined in the 
shotput and achieved a new CMU 
school record with his 15.71 meter 
throw. Scott Jubeck, fellow Tartan 
and Carnegie Mellon football player 
came in second-place with a final 
distance of 14.90 meters.
Also, in the men’s division on 
Saturday, Jared Markowitz, a junior 
physics major, achieved top honors 
in the 5000 meter relay. The remain­
ing top three spots went to Carnegie
Women’s Basketball
Tuesday, January 28
I Rochester 69, Nazareth College 49 
I The Yellowjackets used a 22-5 run at 
[ the start of the second half to open up 
j a previously close game against 
i Nazareth (6-7). With the win, 
' Rochester held on to their top-10 
national ranking while improving to 
14-1 for the season.
Babson College 62, Brandeis 60 
The Judges dropped a heartbreaker 
to non-conference Babson (9-7) in a 
game in which neither team led by 
more than six points. Joanna Maher 
; scored the winning basket with 5.6 
; seconds remaining for Babson, who
¦ have won three of their last five 
> games by one or two points.
! Chicago 75, Benedictine University 
(IL) 60
; The Maroons spread the ball around 
j to coast to an easy win against visit- 
' ing Benedictine (9-11). Janae 
! Winner led three Chicago players in 
| double-digit scoring with a team high 
| of 15. Misty Nguyen had a game high 
\ of 18 for Benedictine.
I
Friday, January 31
Rochester 78, CWRU 70 
. CWRU (11-5, 3-2) held tough, but 
couldn’t keep up with the no. 10 
; Yellowjackets (15-1, 5-1) down the
¦ stretch. Erika Smith’s 26 points
¦ helped Rochester maintain their 
! pressure on conference-leading 
! Washington. Keesha Allen had 23 
\ points to lead the Spartans.
j Washington 93, Brandeis 70 
i Like the Spartans against Rochester, 
! the Judges (9-7, 2-A) stayed with the 
I no. 1 Bears (17-0, 6-0) for a half, but 
; fell off late. Hallie Hutchins was one 
; of four Bears to score in double digits,
• recording a career-high 23 points.
I
! Chicago 59, NYU 45 
Angel Korer recorded 16 points and 
nine rebounds to lead the Maroons 
(8-9, 2-4) past the Violets (13-4, 
3-3). After trailing by one at the half, 
Chicago took the lead for good at the 
10:42 mark and used a 15-5 run to 
. put the game out of reach. Susan 
| Gutowski had 12 points and five 
j steals for Chicago, and Paula Lepka 
s added 10 points and seven rebounds.
Sunday, February 2
Rochester 64, Emory 63 
Coming off five straight losses, there 
was little expectation that the Eagles 
would win in Rochester where the 
Yellowjackets were undefeated this 
season. Rochester could not shake 
them, winning only after a buzzer- 
beater three-pointer by Eagle Beth 
Byron fell short as time expired.
Brandeis 72, Chicago 62 
Explosive performances by Judge for­
ward Danielle Fitzpatrick with 22 
points and guard Lisa Pritzlaff with 
19 points led Brandeis over the 
Maroons for their third UAA victory 
of the year.
Washington 53, NYU 44 
New York surprised the first-ranked 
Bears, keeping the game close and 
trailing by only three points at half- 
time, but Washington's depth 
widened the gap as six Bears 
combined for 24 points over the sec­
ond half.
Men’s Basketball
Tuesday, January 28
Brandeis 72, Tufts University 70 
Patrick Collier beat the buzzer with a 
lay-up to give the host Judges a win 
over non-conference opponent Tufts 
(8-8). Brandeis led by nine at the 
half, but watched their lead slip away 
until Collier’s last-second effort.
Friday, January 31
Rochester 77, CWRU 63 
Andy Larkin’s game-high 18 points 
helped the Yellowjackets (14—3, 4—2) 
snap a three-game losing streak with 
a win over the Spartans (4-14, 1-6). 
Tied at the half, Rochester opened 
the second frame with an 8-0 run, 
after which the Spartans never got 
closer than six points.
Washington 92, Brandeis 60 
The Bears (17-0, 6-0) remained per­
fect with an easy win over the visiting 
Judges (5-9, 2-4). Washington led 
by as many as 35, paced by Chris 
Jefferies’ game-high 21 points. 
Jarriot Rook added 11 points, seven 
rebounds, and seven blocks for the 
Bears.
Chicago 83, NYU 66 
Five Maroons scored in double fig­
ures as Chicago (10-8, 6-1) won its
fifth straight at the expense of the 
Violets (10-8, 1-6). Cruising to a 
nine-point halftime lead, the 
Maroons held on the second half, 
never allowing NYU to get closer than 
seven points. James Janeczek had a 
game-high 19 points for NYU.
Sunday, February 2
Rochester 92, Emory 74 
The Yellowjackets shot 63 percent 
from three-point range and compiled 
30 assists on 34 shots en route to a 
thrashing of the weak Eagles. 
Forward Jeff Joss led Rochester with 
22 points in the victory.
Chicago 73, Brandeis 57 
Senior Derek Reich, the Maroons 
leading scorer, dropped 24 points as

Men's hoops 
sweeps UAA 
opponents
by Adam Greenberg
Sports Editor
To avoid consecutive road series, 
the UAA is required to schedule a 
pair of home-and-home weekends at 
mid-season for its teams. In the first 
of; these weekends, the Tartans 
ClO-7, 4-3) faced the Emory Eagles 
(9-7, 2—5) and the Case Western 
Reserve Spartans (4-14, 1-6) at 
hom£.
Friday’s game brought the Eagles 
in, fre§'h off wins against Brandeis 
and NYU, seeking to upset the 
Tartans,\who are amidst their first 
winning Season since 1996.
Emory started the game draining 
two of their four three-pointers in 
the first five minutes. Emory took 
the quick lead for CMU 12-4 with 
four minutes gone in the game.
The Tartans closed the gap on 
good team play and rebounding, 
tying the score at 15-15 and again 
after a short drought at 21 apiece. 
Carnegie Mellon did not look back.
Led by the play of staunch veteran 
forward Matthew Kaitz and the new 
talent of guards A.J. Straub and 
Mickey Goetz, the team would not 
trail again over the remainder of the 
game.
In addition, the Tartans were led 
in rebounding by senior Ross 
Freeman, who grabbed 15 boards in 
35 minutes. By itself, this would be 
double his season average of 7.4 
rebounds per game. But Freeman 
outperformed his average by more 
than double, pulling down all 15 on 
an aggregated stress fracture in his 
leg.
“[Ross Freeman] is the toughest 
guy I’ve ever coached,” said head, 
coach Tony Wingen.
Emory was able to close the CMU 
lead to a single point, but three con­
secutive three-pointers by Goetz, 
guard Nick Miller, and Freeman put 
the Tartans back into a double digit 
lead, 40-30.
The Carnegie Mellon 12-point 
lead swelled to 15 early in the second 
half, but dropped to three as Emory 
went on an 11-2 run fueled by for­
wards Chase Fawsett and Karel 
Gless.
The lead wavered in low single 
digits for several minutes before a

14-2 run, capped by a pair of guard 
Jason Walter's free throws that gave 
the Tartans a large 15-point lead 
with seven minutes remaining. This 
lead proved to be insurmountable as 
CiV^U stifled any Emory attempt to 
close it, and the Tartans took the 
opening game of their Weekend 
series, 89-76.
Case Western came to Skibo on 
Sunday off a close loss to the strong 
Rochester Yellowjackets. That they 
kept on the tail of Rochester through 
the first half gave the Spartans hope 
that they could win against the 
Tartans despite their abysmal season 
to date.
“We had played defense, rebound­
ed and shot well all season,” said 
Wingen, explaining that they had 
ndt always coincided. “Friday night 
arid [Sunday], we put it all together.”
The half opened with Kaitz and 
guard Eliot Goren leading the 
Takans to a quick 11-4 lead. The 
fouls started quickly and CMU shot 
six early free throws, making five of 
them.
By the end of the game, Case 
Western had four players with four 
or five fouls each, and CMU had shot 
41 free throws. Making free throws, 
a key to any game, waxed important 
with the 41 opportunities given to
them by the Spartans.
The Tartans cashed in on those 
chances and scored more than one- 
third of their points from the line.
The Spartans were able to keep 
the game close in the first half, but 
mirroring their Rochester game, fell 
in the second. The Tartans were 
unfazed by the small lead at half- 
time, despite the better-than-expect- 
ed play by Case Western and the 
Tartans soon found themselves con­
trolling the game with large double­
digit leads that Case Western 
Reserve had had trouble with all 
year.

Women’s basketball gets key wins against UAA rivals over weekend
by Adam Greenberg
Sports Editor
Last weekend’s exciting split 
against tough UAA opponents gave 
the women’s basketball team (12-6, 
4—3) a challenge for this weekend: 
follow up with wins against the mid­
dle of the conference pack. The 
weekend featured games against 
Emory (7-8, 0-7) and Case Western 
Reserve (11-7, 3-4). Though Case 
Western is having an excellent year,
both teams are suffering from subpar 
conference performance in the diffi­
cult UAA.
The team met their challenge, dis­
posing of both the Eagles and the 
Spartans in two similar games, 
which left the Tartans in sole poses- 
sion of third place in the UAA, 
behind Washington and Rochester.
The Friday game against Emory 
started off poorly with the Eagles 
taking a quick 7-0 lead. Carnegie 
Mellon picked up their play, and the 
score was tied at 15 apiece partway
«through the first half. The Tartans 
cccontinued their run, taking the score 
to 23-15 in a half which saw four 
three-pointers and 18 points by 
jufaior forward Carissa Sain.
the halftime lead of 39-27 was 
not insurmountable statistically, but 
the Tartans kept the game out of 
reach for the Eagles.
When Sain’s hot streak from 
beyond the arc went cold compared 
to her; stellar first-half performance, 
her teammates backed her up and 
kept the CMU lead intact.
The Eagles, led by forward Allison 
Reopal and center Stephanie Seibert, 
went on a short run in the second 
half, but could not edge any closer 
than six points. Carnegie Mellon 
kept the très coming with first-year 
center Dava Sommermeyer hitting 
her first collegiate three.
The Tartans held on for a 65-57 
victory over their weaker opponents, 
but the bigger test would be their 
game against Case Western, ranked 
eighth in the Division III Great Lakes 
region. Sunday’s game against the 
Spartans did prove the more difficult 
task, but the Tartans were able to 
win against their conference foe.
The game started close, and 
Carnegie Mellon had some trouble 
pulling away from Case Western 
until after three combined steals 
from senior guard Michelle Sodini 
and junior forward Danyelle Sinclair.
The Tartans started to pull away 
and had an admirable six point lead 
midway through the first period. The 
Spartans closed in to tie the score at 
21-21, but that was the last time 
they would see daylight in their 
attempts to beat the Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon finished the half 
on an 11-3 run, and the eight point 
lead would prove enough of a charge 
going into the second period.

Season to date
the night and Walters’s rebounding 
kept the encroaching Spartans from 
closing the lead to fewer than 11 
points during the final 15 minutes of 
the game.
The game ended as usual with the 
team that was behind fouling pro­
fusely, but the Tartans hit six of their 
last eight free throw attempts for 31 
total made from the line in the game 
and held on for a definitive victory 
over a conference opponent, 82-59.
“We have a solid core of players 
[who are] starting to come together 
and play well,” said Goren. “We plan 
on making winning a tradition, part 
of Carnegie Mellon basketball.”
Double-digit leads were the fare of 
the afternoon for the Carnegie 
Mellon defense. They held a lead of 
ten or more points from just after the 
beginning of the second half until 
Case Western made a run with eight 
minutes gone.
Led by guard Keesha Allen, the 
Spartans pulled to within one point 
with five minutes to play after a two- 
point jump shot by center Andrea 
Haylett.
Anticipating the threat to their vic­
tory, the Tartan defense clamped 
down and the Tartans finished the 
game on a 19-9 run which included 
eight made free throws by Sodini, as 
well as a pair each from Sain and 
guard Marcia Velencia.
“Women’s Basketball in the UAA is 
loaded with national caliber teams 
who we compete with day in and day 
out,” said head coach Gerry Seidl, 
proud of the accomplishments of her 
team this year. “We have a tremen­
dously tough schedule, and these 
young ladies come to play every 
night.”
The wins this weekend will prove 
useful tools in winning in Cleveland 
and Atlanta next weekend against 
these same opponents, as the team 
starts the second half of UAA play 
this season.

Well kids, over the last few months 
I have greeted you in every issue with 
my ramblings about a game that I like 
to watch. I understand that not all of 
my columns have been good. Some 
have been trite, some tiring, some 
boring, and most tried desperately to 
be funny but just came out stupid.
For all those who read the garbage 
I throw down, I appreciate it. But as I 
suffer through my football withdraw­
al, my column is the last thing on my 
mind.
I remember some of the best 
moments of the season, and all of the 
great things football offers its fans, 
and I feel that it is necessary to give 
thanks. For those of you who may be 
unused to doing this, I’ve once again 
taken the liberty of writing it down 
for you. Simply bow your heads, put 
down your beer cans, resist buying 
that third ‘O’ hot dog, and give thanks 
to God for smiling on us with the 
2002 season.
Dear Lord, I’d like to begin by 
thanking you for $18 cases of 
Yuengling; truly, you continue to 
bless this glorious city of Pittsburgh. 
Now God, another NFL season has 
come and gone, and I just wanted to 
let you know that I appreciate every­
thing the NFL has to offer us.
Thank you, Lord, for the explosive­
ness of Mike Vick; if he stays healthy, 
he will be one of the best quarter­
backs ever to play this game. I raise 
my cheap plastic bottle and tip my 
worn Stiller’s cap to him and to all of 
the exciting young players in this 
league who made the games fun to 
watch this year.
I thank you also, Lord, for the 
tough veterans like Donavan 
McNabb, Brett Favre, and of course 
Steve McNair. Their inspirational dis­
plays of character made for some 
great games throughout the season. 
Lord, I would give up grease for two 
days to see anyone like that come to 
Pittsburgh.
Please grant our team the good for­
tune of landing a high-priced free 
agent, or getting a steal in the draft. 
We need a running back, the Bus is 
worn down, and Amos isn’t the guy to 
take his place.
Perhaps a chance on McGahee late 
in the first round would work out 
good for us; you could even use his 
success to help fill your miracle 
quota. Right now, God, we don’t have 
all the pieces necessary to win it all.
In addition to a weak running 
game, our secondary needs major 
reconstruction over the off-season. 
Lee Flowers wants out, which can 
only hurt us more. God, perhaps you 
could make the weather in Pittsburgh 
tolerable long enough for a great 
player to visit this city and sign a 
long-term contract.
Still, God, we are a good team, and 
we were a bad [expletive] call away 
from a shot at the Raiders. If you 
could kindly break Joe Nedney’s leg, 
and smite Jeff Fischer for that shame­
ful I’ve-been-stranded-on-a-desert- 
island-for-the-last-five-years beard, 
me and the guys down at the bar 
would be eternally grateful.
Lord, if you could make the offici­
ating a little better as well, especially 
in the post-season, football fans 
everywhere (except San Francisco 
and Nashville) would certainly be 
better off.
All in all, God, it was a good sea­
son. In addition to the bottoms of sev­
eral bottles, we saw record breaking 
seasons by players both young and 
old. We saw a glimpse of the future in 
Vick and Tomlinson, and a throwback 
to the past with Rich Gannon and the 
Raider offense.
We saw some great celebrations 
from T.O. and some bad dances by 
any white boy who managed to do 
something right.
Please God, could you grant them 
rhythm, or at least the knowledge 
that they shouldn’t be dancing with­
out it?
Mostly, God, we got to see the most 
exciting game on earth, and all the 
great plays that come with it. The 
long kick returns, the great moves, 
the thrilling runs, the twins, all of 
these make our Sunday afternoons 
well-spent.
Lord, as I enjoy football for one last 
weekend, I thank you for another 
good season with a prayer to get me 
through to the next:
God, grant me the serenity to accept 
TV that isn’t football,
The coverage of old games to make 
me think it is still football season,
And when the season starts again, let 
me be sober enough to know the dif­
ference.

PA’s cutest weatherman calls for six weeks of winter
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye:
Pennsylvania’s favorite groundhog predicts six more weeks of winter
It’s hard to spell and it doesn’t exactly roll 
off your tongue, but Punxsutawney is a 
meaningful name in the US. For one 
morning a year, the tiny town in western 
Pennsylvania becomes the focus of a 
nation. And a furry, squinty-eyed, unlike­
ly little creature named Phil becomes its 
hero.
Punxsutawney Phil, probably the most 
famous rodent in the United States after 
Mickey Mouse, is quite the celebrity on 
February 2, a date more commonly 
known as Groundhog Day. So the story 
goes, if Phil steps out that morning and 
sees his shadow, we are guaranteed six 
more weeks of winter. No shadow?
Spring is right around the corner. It’s a 
fun holiday, even if it’s not so important 
in the grand scheme of things.
Many people think that Groundhog Day is solely an American tradition, but the now-secular holi­
day actually stems from early Christian beliefs associated with Candlemas Day. On this day, the cler­
gy would bless candles that would then be distributed to the people. But even then, it was a land­
mark day in the calendar of the seasons, and the weather was very important. If it rained, then win­
ter was over; if the sun shone and the weather was generally fair, the “second winter” was sure to 
come.
The story continues that Roman legions passed on the Candlemas Day superstitions to the 
Germans, who looked to the hedgehog to determine whether or not the sun had really come out. 
When the Germans settled in Pennsylvania, they decided that the groundhog resembled the 
European hedgehog closely enough to be trusted, and so the attention of the people was focused on 
Phil’s ancestors for one day a year.
Somehow legend and lore led to a small annual ceremony in the woods, which morphed into a 
gigantic spectacle on Gobbler’s Knob. Today, tens of thousands of people from hundreds of miles 
around gather in the wee hours of the morning and await Phil’s appearance. And not ojie bit of the 
ceremony is lost.
Part of watching Phil emerge around 7:30 am is watching his so-called Inner Circle stage the hello. 
Nineteen men clad in tuxedos and top hats mill around Phil’s tree-stump house, all with very spe­
cific purposes and titles. There’s Ron Ploucha, the Stump Warden, Bob Roberts, his Protector, Bob 
Chamber and Jeff Lundy, the Cold and Fair Weathermen respectively, Bill Deeley, his Handler, and 
Mike Johnston, the ever-important Big Flake Maker, just to name a few. All are proud of Phil and 
even prouder of their community, “the most famous small town in America.”
And it’s not famous just because Bill Murray starred in a movie about it, though Groundhog Day 
boosted attendance after its 1993 release by so much that the town of Punxsutawney now runs 
shuttle buses to satisfy all of the Gobbler’s Knob visitors. This year, more than 30,000 people were 
expected to show, possibly the largest crowd in attendance yet. Hopefully none were disappointed 
that, on the morning of February 2, 2003, Phil emerged and did indeed see his shadow.
If the thought of six more weeks of winter doesn’t appeal to you, however, Ohio’s Buckeye Chuck is 
the one to look to this year. He didn’t see his shadow.

Uncle Vanya falls flat: A powerful act:
Pitt Repertory spoils Chekhov Power Plays makes for a nice evening out
His fiction and short stories turned melancholic Russian literature on its waxy, 
hairy ear. Misery was funny, and even lucrative at the box office. But even after 
the great theatres of the world have seen Anton Chekhov come and go, can just 
any director make turn-of-the-century Russian pathos truly worth laughing at? 
The trick is to marry the briniest aspects of human suffering to plenty of curi­
ous, coincidental humor. The yield should be enough sour humiliation and 
regret for all the players and a seamless whip of mild, bittersweet contentment 
that spoons itself into the mouths of a patient audience. But comedy can be as 
capricious as the swell of a lopsided soufflé, and would-be farceurs should be 
advised that, as when baking, a clear-cut sense of logic and proportion is key.
Pitt Repertory Theatre’s production of Uncle Vanya, one of Chekhov's most 
beloved and philosophical works, was at best trippy, and at worst like slogging 
through oatmeal. Chekhov, teaching the world to be glib, wrote that boredom 
was worse than death. But what would be worse than boredom? Boredom in 
the dark with ninety-nine other strangers?
The show’s design had an even temperament, but a few jarring choices aimed at 
something else. Robert Neu’s lights cast the perfect vanilla glow to add patina to 
Robert C.T. Steele’s chaste, decorous costuming, but at a few odd moments, a 
magenta light or strange sound effect would prove too obtrusive for the stage's 
tranquil mood. All in all, it reeked of Alice in Wonderland; its fanciful airs combined 
the occasional dream sequence and contrasted with enough modish “razzle-daz- 
zle” to make the mix slighdy off-putting. Yelena’s “tango” sequence, —done under 
red light that would even make Ozzy Osbourne blush — was a bit much.
But Director Bruce McConachie and set designer Julie Ray have made good use 
of a tight, fickle space. Seating blocks splay out onto decks and up onto risers, 
and merge with acting areas with surprising ease. Well-planned sight lines 
allow full access to each upholstered tuffet and frowsy splash of Victorian décor, 
but even so, a rogue leaflet in the program instructed us to “MOVE! MOVE! 
MOVE!” to another color-coded area to enjoy a different vantage point.
None of the actors were particularly solid and the director's choices were a bit 
forced. It's hard to completely ruin Chekhov, but this performance of Uncle 
Vanya wasn’t funny.

They idolize Neil Simon. They thank God for the royalty checks sent by com­
munity theatres for Crimes of the Heart. And at night, they dream of a tanned, 
toned Chorus Line. But crusty hack playwrights Elaine May and Alan Arkin 
don’t love theatre. They love the laughs - and the dollars that follow the laughs
- and the blue-haired subscription audience whose wills drizzle money over 
the foundations that produce and direct the laughs.
From the Big Apple to the Little Pierogi, the whole industry is in cahoots - the 
only thing that’s missing is a resistance movement. That’s why it’s puzzling that 
tough little Open Stage chose to produce a show like Power Plays. Along with 
the Company’s recent eviction from the Lester Hamburg Theatre, its move to 
the Strip District, and its long list of respectable work, each Open Stage pro­
duction is a lesson in beating the odds. So why choose smarmy, jittery pap rem­
iniscent of Broadway, 1973?
The show is tenable, despite makeshift production values. Special mention goes 
to the resourceful David Maslow, set designer and director, for extremely practi­
cal use of cardboard boxes. Maslow makes moments work; he’s capable and 
careful with physical humor, and doesn’t shirk the niceties of verbal repartee.
The acting holds up nicely. As Draconian socialite Margaret Asquith and Wanda, 
a panicky root-canal patient, Arlene Merryman is used to good comic effect. As 
Margaret’s secretary Joan, Susaan Jamshidi draws notice: her graceful speech, 
bold choices and alarmingly fast shift from victim to predator are delightful. As 
two operatives taking an imaginary journey during a stakeout, Gregory Caridi 
and Ronald Fernandez make short work of a difficult, thinly-written scene; as a 
father-and-son dental team in the third one-act, the two really shine.
Costumes by Cindy Pace and lighting by Matthew Kopans are functional and 
appealing, and sax riffs by an uncredited musician and narration of the scene 
changes by house manager Layla Ghaznavi are endearing.
This show deserves to be seen. Opportunities to give back to the community don’t 
get much better, and for an entertaining, casual night out, you could do a lot worse.

Flipping over flapjacks:
Where to find the best pancakes in Pittsburgh
1. De Luca’s Restaurant: Strip District.
If you’re searching for the traditional, fluffy, and cake-like pancake, then De 
Luca’s in the Strip is your best bet. Thick and hearty, these babies are the kindest 
to the post-drinking digestive system, and absorb syrup at just the right pace.
2. Pamela’s: Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill.
These crispy-edged, crêpe-like pancakes are infamous at all three Pamela's 
restaurants around the Pittsburgh area. Though technically Pamela’s offers a 
hybrid of pancake and crêpé— a borderline dessert, the occasional victim of too 
much grease — it’s the only place in Pittsburgh where you can find the variety 
of toppings and fillings that this hot spot offers up!
3. Ritter’s: Bloomfield, Oakland.
If you want the most for your buck, and a high-quality pancake that’s moist and 
also sports the popular crispy edge, then the late-night hub known as Ritter’s is 
where you'll want to park and eat. Also, for all those craving a little chocolate, 
Ritter’s has a special chocolate chip pancake that’s just right for you.
4. Tom’s Diner: Southside.
Tom makes a pretty mean pancake - large, buoyant, and with the traditional 
cake-like consistency. Though lacking the crisp edge that Pamela’s and Ritter’s 
offer, and guilty of being a little too dry at times, Tom didn’t cut back on quan­
tity or overprice his product.
5. Eat ’n Park: Squirrel Hill, Edgewood, Waterfront.
Though Eat ’n Park is open late and willing to serve, do not be tempted by their 
easy pancake. Eat ’n Park is notorious for its lack of taste, and their pancakes are 
no exception. These plain patties have been found to leave a freezer-bum after­
taste in the mouth, along with a hint of artificial butter flavor. You’re better off 
with a box mix.
For those who want to make a good pancake at home, and wish to venture away 
from Aunt Jemima and try something new, follow the directions below on how 
to do as the Native Americans did and make your own cornmeal pancakes:
CORNMEAL PANCAKES
(Makes 10 to 12 pancakes)
1 package Jiffy® Corn Muffin Mix
1 egg
2 tbsp. melted shortening 
3/4 cup milk
1. Preheat griddle.
2. Grease lightly
3. Blend ingredients. Batter will be slightly lumpy.
4. Pour batter on hot griddle.
5. Turn pancakes when bubbles appear.
The pancake - a warm and syrup-friendly circle, the comfort food of the morning 
meal - has existed since long before the just-add-water variety was placed on the 
market. The earliest pancake was an unleavened patty, similar to the Jewish bread 
known as Matzo. Its birthplace is believed to be pre-historic China and Nepal; 
however, numerous cultures created their own recipes depending on the grains 
and ingredients that they had at their disposal. The Native Americans used corn 
flour and a small amount of water to cook “sun-cakes,” while the French used the 
prevalent buckwheat grains of their region to create the first crêpes.
The search for the ideal pancake is always on the tip of the breakfast-lover’s 
tongue. Whether that ideal is the product of a rich buttermilk batter, has a thin 
and delicate taste, or is the traditional American-style cake, Pittsburgh has it all.

Grover and Lamb Chop tell all:
Puppet Conference at the Carnegie Museum of Art
Photo Courtesy of the Càrnegie Museum of Art
Grover, Art Cat, and Lamb Chop round out the panel at this symposium.
Grover, Lamb Chop, Fozzie Bear - these names con­
jure up personalities as vivid and varied as the colors 
of their features and fur, in shows ranging from Mr. 
Rogers’ Neighborhood to Sesame Street, echoing back 
to the late ‘40s. In his Puppet Conference video exhibit 
at the Carnegie Museum of Art, Christian Jankowski 
asks us to consider the opinions that puppets have 
about entertainment, education, and what it’s like to 
work with humans.
The video documents a puppet conference held at the 
Carnegie Museum of Art. Led by the eloquent Art Cat, 
"he museum’s mascot for family activities who wears 
a maroon beret, the symposium’s panelists include 
Grover of Sesame Street, Fozzie Bear from The Muppet 
Show, Lamb Chop, originally from Captain Kangaroo, 
and Mr. Shelby from The Magic Woods, a child-orient- 
ed nature program based in Pittsburgh. Even Sesame 
Street’s Elmo makes a cameo appearance.
It is a bit of an intellectual surprise to see these estab­
lished personalities assembled together in a self-con­
tained work of fiction. But even though Jankowski
puts the puppets in a situation different from those 
we’ve become accustomed to seeing them in, he is 
faithful to each character’s idiosyncrasies.
Grover still uses flamboyant gestures and is just as dra­
matic and clueless as you’d expect. When asked what 
puppets are, for example, he answers, “You wear them 
around your waist to hold up your pants.”
Mr. Shelby, a wrinkled 150-year-old turtle and new­
comer to TV’s The Magic Woods, imparts his age-earned 
wisdom in an English accent. The goal of his show, he 
says, is to “use TV itself to tell children to turn off the 
TV and go outside.”
Lamb Chop, never known for her modesty, announces 
that she’s been an icon for four decades and launches 
into a song, “Puppets Make the World Go Round,” to 
the tune of the infamous “Song that Never Ends.” She 
appears with ventriloquist Mallory Lewis, Shari Lewis’s 
daughter.
Fozzie Bear, making flat jokes as usual, contrasts The
Muppet Show and Sesame Street, and comments 
on how today’s audiences demand entertainment 
at a faster pace.
The questioning is occasionally suspended as we 
get a view of the audience, which is composed of 
a wide array of puppets ranging from a toilet 
brush to a witch. In those moments, we witness a 
bizarre exchange between the puppets about 
something deep like the nature of reality and illu­
sion.
While the credits roll, there is a brief conversa­
tion between two puppets who comment on the 
nature of comedy and tragedy. These periodic 
exchanges, tangential at best, distract from the 
issues that the panelists bring to the table. But 
barring the occasional random interjection, 
Jankowski certainly succeeds in raising questions 
about puppets outside of children’s mass media.

Happy Chinese New Year:
Holiday food and festivities complement Asian portraiture at the Warhol
ichThe millennia-old traditions of ancient China were celebrated with 
imperial flair at the Warhol Museum on Saturday. The museum was trans­
formed for the occasion, the lobby taking on the regal red of ancient China. 
The traditional sweets of oranges and candied ginger were provided along 
with an array of teas, as well as the fortune cookies traditionally found in 
American Chinese restaurants. The event culminated with the appearance 
of a green dragon and an enthusiastic pronouncement of the Year of the 
Ram.
The celebration marked the unveiling of a new exhibit featuring a large 
collection of ancient Chinese portraits, impressive pieces of artwork that 
were created to provide images through which the Chinese could pray to 
their ancestors.
The majestic tapestries stand well over six feet tall, each piece created with 
meticulous attention to detail. Each ancestor portrait is painted on a mam­
moth silk scroll, the intricate patterns of traditional dress and jewelry cap­
tured with rich color. The faces of these portraits contradict their decora­
tive dress, each set in the stern countenance of an aristocrat.
The festivities also included a lecture given by Jan Stuart, Evelyn Rawski, and 
Karen Gerhardt. The first two speakers discussed Chinese ancestor portraits, 
while Gerhardt lectured on similar customs in the Japanese tradition. The lec­
ture was extremely well attended, and the museum officials were forced to 
disallow entry after the room had been filled to capacity. The lecture was pro­
jected onto the wall of the lobby for those who still wanted to absorb the infor­
mation, although the words of the speakers were forced to compete with the 
hubbub of children consuming oranges and fortune cookies.
The history of these ancestor portraits is an interesting one. The works came 
into fashion as household decorations for the wealthy, and some eventually 
parted with the avatars of their ancestors. Richard G. Pritzlaff amassed the 
large collection of these portraits on display in the Warhol Museum, recogniz­
ing their importance with no training in art or Chinese culture. His collection 
was donated to the Sackler Gallery in 1991, though the pieces have not been 
displayed due to the lengthy restoration process. This Saturday marks the first 
public appearance of these pieces of art and history.
The museum makes an interesting com­
parison between the work of Andy Warhol 
and the ancient ancestor portraits. 
Warhol’s screen prints are among his most 
famous works, and while the media may 
be different, both the ancient and contem­
porary works are portraits. One room of 
the exhibit juxtaposes Warhol’s abstract 
and pastel portraits with the strict realism 
of the ancient works instead of presenting 
the ancient portraits alone. The compari­
son is interesting, but at times a bit dis­
tracting. The walls of the room seem clut­
tered, and the regal atmosphere of the 
exhibit’s other room is diminished by 
Warhol’s flashy colors.
The many pairs of ancient eyes stare down at the viewer with the weight of 
ages, the religious significance of the portraits radiating from their massive 
red frames. The superb lighting for the 
exhibit highlights this effect, each piece 
illuminated fully with the overall ambi­
ence remaining dim.
’u. Dm0we9 AloFF0,ulw,
Those who were so inclined could create 
their own ancestor portraits in the muse­
um’s workshop on the bottom floor. A dig­
ital picture was taken of the artist and a 
color printout was issued. This could then 
be decorated with watercolor paints and 
gold leaf. Similar decoration techniques 
could also be used to beautify animals of 
the Chinese zodiac. All manner of individ­
uals took part in this exercise, with chil­
dren and art students competing for dom­
inance of the paints and brushes.

Distorted images:
What it’s like to live with anorexia
You look in the mirror and see a flab of skin here, a roll 
of fat there. You don’t see a real person, but an enor­
mous entity that selfishly guides you through a life 
where food is your enemy and starvation is the only 
way that you feel you can control yourself. This is 
anorexia, a disorder that affects many people today. 
The Tartan was privileged enough to get a first-hand 
account of a girl who batdes the disorder. She remains 
anonymous, but hopes that this story well help other 
anorexics to stop and also to educate those who don’t 
know the story behind the disease.
The Tartan: When did this disorder start?
Anonymous: I must have been twelve years old. I’ve 
been told... that it [has a lot to do with] environment 
or your genetics or your cause of trauma or whatever.
TT: And you continue to do it why?
A: You don’t sit there and say, "Ok, I’m going to be like 
this.” You slip into it and spiral downwards until you 
catch yourself and realize how sick you are.
I
TT: On a normal day, what do you eat?
A: For the past week, I’ve pretty much not had any 
calories. But generally... with the exception of fasts 
and stuff, I’ve been consuming 300 to 400 calories a 
day, mostly liquid. If I’ve only had water all day, then 
I can have something to eat. Yesterday I had a biscuit. 
That was like 400 calories right there. [I used to trick 
my] body into believing that I was eating more.... It’s 
called two-four-six-eight, and one day you eat 200 
calories, and the next day you eat 400, and the next 
day you eat 600, and the day after that you eat 800.... 
I’m not doing that [anymore] because I don’t want to 
trick my body that way. I’m tricking it in other ways, 
like drinking ridiculous amounts of water.... It makes 
me feel full and it washes out all the toxins in my 
body and all the food that could be there. And diet 
soda gives you the impression that you’re eating. It 
gives your body the energy that it would have if you’d 
been eating sugar. But it doesn’t have any sugar in it. 
And so after a while, your body picks up on that.
TT: How many other people do you know that have 
this problem?
A: I don’t think I know anyone.
TT: I take it your family doesn’t know about this?
A: My family can tell because the weight loss is so 
drastic that you have to know. My mother is very 
body-conscious about herself and her daughters. So, 
my younger sister was bulimic for a while and I don’t 
know if she’s better now. My mom tells her she’s fat.
And my mom did that to me once and I lost so much 
weight in one month. This was when I was seven­
teen. I have pictures of that and I was like a corpse. I 
had nothing, I couldn’t even move.
TT: How much did you weigh before she actually 
told you that you were fat?
A: I probably weighed 120 pounds or something.
TT: And how tall were you?
A: Five-nine.
TT: So how much were you after the fact?
A: I don’t even remember how much I was, but I 
know my lowest has been seventy-nine.That’s when 
I went to the hospital... [when I was] fourteen.
TT: When I look at you, I see a beautiful girl. You are 
not fat at all. Even when people say these things to 
you it still doesn’t change how you see yourself?
A: No. I can’t see what you see.
TT: What do you have to eat in order to make you 
feel like you’re feeling better?
A: It’s not eating.... I have never gotten to the mini­
mum body weight that I should weigh for my 
height... which is 142,1 believe. No, I think it’s from 
139 to 152. And I’ve gone just below that.
TT: How much do you weigh now?
A: 124.5
TT: When was the last time you weighed yourself?
A: Ten minutes ago.... [I weigh myself] a couple 
times a day. Every time I have the chance.
TT: How do you view other people who basically eat 
normally? Do you see them as being fat?
A: No. It’s two different things. When I see other 
people, I see them as being beautiful... and so much 
thinner than I am.... I’ve brainwashed myself.... The 
other day I was talking to someone who’s also 
anorexic. She was saying “I ate a salad today.” I just 
freaked out. “Oh, man! How could you do that?” 
And then I catch myself and I’m like “Why would I 
think that? That’s healthy. That’s good.” When I eat,
I eat cookies or Nutella or something because I crave 
it all the time. And I think that something like salad 
is so much food. I don’t see [other people] as being 
fat. I see their habits as being gross.
TT: What have been some of the side effects that 
you’ve noticed?
A: I don’t think I’ve noticed permanent side effects 
that I can see, except... when I get sick, I get sick like 
I’m going to die. I have no immune system and I 
never get better. And I’m very anemic. I’m dizzy all 
the time... tired all the time. My body shakes a lot, 
and when you do this for a while, you stop getting 
your period when your body mass index is under 
twenty.... I don’t have enough calories to feed my 
internal organs. 1954 calories a day go toward your 
vital organs and I don’t eat a fraction of that.... But 
the thing is, I don’t want to get better. I’m not going 
to get better unless someone makes me get better.
TT: What would they have to do for you to get bet­
ter?
A: If I knew, I would probably do it myself. I can’t 
stop. It’s horrifying, but I’m proud of everything. I’m 
proud of the fact that I can’t fit into the jeans I 
bought a week ago, that I’m so strong in this 
screwed up sort of way. And... I don’t think it’s ever 
going to be enough. I feel so bad because all the 
people around me are having such hard times. The 
people who I haven’t been able to tell are starting to 
notice, and... I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to 
hurt anyone.

Reading between the lines:
Gendertalk exposes the gender biases in popular magazines
Differences between men’s and 
women’s magazines may be more 
than superficial. Patel pointed out 
that there are usually more pictures 
of good looking men in men's mag­
azines than in women’s magazines, 
oddly enough. Yet, pictures of 
women tend to be more highly sex- 
ualized in all magazines. Nipples 
are erect, butt cracks stare the cam­
era in the face, and cleavage 
abounds. Pictures of men, on the 
other hand, either obscure the gen­
italia or, when pictured, the men 
are unaroused.
The topic of objectification of men led 
to questions that were not quickly set­
tled, ranging from advertising strate­
gies to bigger-picture questions. 
Attendees questioned the abundance 
of half-naked women in ads that sell 
products to women, and also asked 
why there are ads with naked people 
but no visible sign of the product. 
Wondering about the ways in which 
men and women are presented in 
magazines,* they pondered whether 
objectivity or equality is the problem 
and whether it is good that men areBradford Yankiver/Photo Editor
Luis Cota, Linda Yang, and Ruth Lin study popular magazines for their chauvinistic subtext.
Flipping through an issue of Men’s Journal, junior ECE/CS student Suril Patel 
scoffed, “Thirty-seven inches, that’s it?” During the latest meeting of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Gendertalk lecture series, Patel paused to look at a page of LCD- and 
plasma-screen TVs. The advertisement followed a section on men’s fashion, an 
article about football, and a feature story verifying many men’s long-held fan­
tasies that Swedish women are not only very beautiful, but also very horny. 
Such variety in article topics led Patel to comment that Men’s Journal is much 
different from the celebrated Maxim, “a whole different world” with more of a 
focus on women and less on other stereotypically male topics like sports and 
technology.
After looking through several popular men’s and women’s magazines, the 
Gendertalk group quickly established that women are objectified in both types 
of publications, with half-naked women gracing the pages of Cosmopolitan and 
Glamour as often as Maxim.
However, the discussion soon turned to the objectification of men. Many 
people at Gendertalk believed that images of muscular men put pressure on 
men to achieve an idealized look, just as women feel driven to live up to the 
images of slim, buxom young women pictured in magazines. Not only are 
the men in magazines attractive and muscular, they usually have lots of 
flashy jewelry, designer clothes, or expensive cars. Men’s magazines like 
Men’s Journal include articles on topics rarely seen in women’s magazines, 
such as unusual vacation plans and power tools. Ellen Vayner, a GSIA sec­
ond-year graduate student, observed that men’s magazines are “much more 
fun and adventurous.”
expected to adhere to these unattainable standards also. Maybe then, they rea­
soned, something would finally be done about it.
The three women who organized and led the meeting, Rebecca Kluchin (a grad­
uate student of history), Rachel Delphia (a graduate student of English), and 
Michelle Grab (coordinator of Student Development), urged the group to focus 
on the question, “So what do we do about this?” One attendee suggested a 
protest, another a refusal to buy magazines that sell unrealistic body images. 
Still another thought that, short of becoming a leading figure in the publishing 
world and creating your own healthy image for people to buy into as an alterna­
tive, nothing would change.
Gendertalk was formed about a year ago after a talk delivered by Kluchin for 
Women’s History Month about birth control and abortions. It occurred to her 
that even though audience members could ask questions after the lecture, there 
was no regular forum that focused solely on discussion of gender issues. The 
next Gendertalk meeting is on February 12, National Freedom to Marry Day. 
Accordingly, the discussion topic will be same-sex marriages and CMU policies 
concerning homosexuality.

Debbie does Broadway:
The infamous film hits the stage with a surprisingly tame soundtrack
Courtesy of Sh-Boom! Records Courtesy of Sh-Boom! Records
PILLBOX. 3 FEBRUARY 2003.
Ending with a climax, the last track on the Debbie Does Dallas soundtrack may be the most memo­
rable: “The Orgasm Medley.” Mimicking the orgasm scene in the Vagina Monologues, a man and var­
ious women begin sarcastic screams of insatiable pleasure.
Tame enough for your grandmother, amusing lyrics and great vocals are blended together in perfect 
harmony. The soundtrack of the off-Broadway play is based upon the infamous 70s porn flick, Debbie 
Does Dallas. With much of the play’s dialogue ripped from the original porn picture, the soundtrack is 
devoid of any plot, containing mostly bittersweet pop songs about dildos and shower sex scenes.
Although the recording commences with an adult advisory on inappropriate language, it need not be 
heeded. Much of the album is sexually suggestive and seductively sweet, but unoriginal. Don’t expect 
to find this disc amidst seas of Playboys — there are more sexual innuendos in Driving Miss Daisy.
Although Debbie isn’t intellectually stimulating, it’s mastered tongue-in cheek comedy. Debbie and 
her cheerleader friends contemplate starting a company to offer “teen services” to fund a trip. These 
girls are not aspiring to go to Harvard; rather, they yearn to become a part of the Texas Cowgirls 
cheerleading squad. With the perky voices of Prozac-popping Tri-Delt sisters, the innocent teens are 
lured into the lucrative world of prostitution. Much like the movie Clueless, society’s GAP-shopping 
norm are not likely to understand the compilation, confusing it with their own autobiographies.
Proudly flaunting their virginity in the beginning of the soundtrack, the girls quickly mutate into val­
ley girls who answer cell phones during oral intercourse. Mouth full, Debbie is complimented by her 
friend, “You have so much spirit, it’s, like, coming out all over!”
If you enjoy the likes of Rent or Barbra Streisand, you will find this CD pleasurable. Rarely insipid, the disc 
mixes pop melodies, enthusiastic singing, and on occasion classic-pom beats and country twang. Some 
may be drawn to belt out the lyrics with the musical’s star, Sherie Rene Scott, in “Where I Need to Go,” a 
song cynically influenced by Celine Dion’s melodramatic “My Heart Will Go On.” Perhaps best heard 
under the influence, the eclectic mix of songs and random senseless lyrics are sure to instill laughter.

Left brain day job:
Research scientist George Stetten shows his musical side
Some might say that science and music don’t mix, but George Stetten would 
disagree. The 49-year-old research scientist at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics 
Institute is the inventor of the Sonic Flashlight, but perhaps more impres­
sively, he filled every role in the production of his album, Awake at the 
Wheel.
This isn’t Stetten’s first version of Awake, and it won’t be his last. He’s on 
version 1.02 of the album, producing it on his home computer using a 
Macintosh-based recording system. He goes through a process of recording, 
listening to the recording, and then editing the recording that he calls 
“painting with your eyes open.” In addition to recording and producing, he 
wrote the songs, sang them, and performed all the instruments, including 
the piano, guitar, bass, and drums. The only help he needed was a few back 
up vocals from his wife and two daughters.
He’s proud to mention that the album’s cover art and all the lyrics are orig­
inal creations. His lyrics are strongly poetic and capable of standing on their 
own. They’re showcased in the vocals with low-key piano and unobtrusive 
guitar and bass making for a mellow, acoustic-rock feel. Think Counting 
Crows with a piano and James Taylor on vocals with a slow Dylan or Neil 
Young rhythmic pace.
When writing the title track of the album, he struggled for a month to find 
a line to rhyme with “staying awake at the wheel” until Bob Dylan’s voice 
came through his head with the answer: “what is this ache that I feel.”
One of his favorite original songs, “Pittsburgh,” gives a short melodic 
description of the city, its rivers and its history with the steel industry, and 
echoes a refrain, “Old Pittsburgh has her ups and downs.”
Stetten draws most of his influences from the early ‘70s. He’ll mention 
James Taylor, Cream, Jackson Browne, and the Grateful Dead’s Jerry 
Garcia, to whom he bears a slight resemblance. He’s been in groups that 
have covered songs from all of these bands at one time or another, but it 
might be hard to imagine Stetten rocking out to Cream after hearing him lay 
out smooth jazz-based chord progressions on the piano in Awake.
At one time, Stetten played 
clubs, but these days you’ll 
find him shying away from 
the lifestyle of the profes­
sional musician, content to 
record at home. He distrib­
utes homemade CDs, sell­
ing them on his personal 
website (Stetten.com) and 
on cdbaby.com.
“In the long run, it might 
be nice to get paid, but 
let’s first see if anyone else 
wants to listen to [my 
album].”
Courtesy of George Stetten
...¿.....M.............—.........................................Courtesy of George Stetten
With that sentiment in mind, Stetten offers free mp3s on his site. What else 
will you find there? Lyrics and sheet music to his songs, and Weisenbaum’s 
Eye (a science-fiction novel he wrote in the late ‘70s about cyberspace).
You might be tempted to think that this singer/songwriter and author is all 
right brain, but when you mention his name you’re more likely to hear about 
his most successful invention, the Sonic Flashlight. This ingenious device 
projects a real time ultrasound image of a section of a patient onto that sec­
tion of the patient. He holds positions at Pitt’s Biomedical Engineering 
department and Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. On top of that, he has 
earned an M.D. from SUNY-Syracuse, an engineering degree from Harvard, 
a PhD in biomedical engineering from Duke, and a master’s degree in neu­
roscience from NYU. He also spent a year at the New England Music 
Conservatory.
Stetten reminds us that music is a system of differences with rhythms and 
patterns completely dependent on math and science. And which is more 
important: his music or his science? Stetten answers, “I kept the day job.”
For now, music is his hobby, recording at home and selling CDs when he can. 
He just got a new drum set and is thinking about inviting some friends over 
for Sunday morning jam sessions.

For many CMU students, Craig Street is simply an eating venue - a place to sip 
a latte at Kiva Han, order Thai Curry Chicken at YumWok, or check out the 
lunch specials at Star of India. But did you know that on Craig Street you can 
also buy the latest CD from your favorite punk band, stock up on your favorite 
Japanese manga, or buy a 200-year-old tribal mask from India?
Over the years, Craig Street has remained one of the most distinctive places in 
Pittsburgh. While other shopping districts - like Walnut Street in Shadyside or 
Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill - have been swamped by big-name retailing ven­
ues, Craig Street has retained its independent spirit. To this day, it remains dot­
ted with small, independent shops that cater to every taste. Craig Street shops 
are all different, but they have one thing in common: they all tell the story of a 
group of people who have turned their passions into a way of life.

Caliban Book Shop
Founded in 1991 by rare-book dealer John Schulman and wife Emily Hetzel, 
Caliban Book Shop is, for the literary crowd, a Craig Street hallmark.
Caliban carries used and rare books, with an especially strong collection of phi­
losophy, poetry, local history, and art books. Its dusty shelves are piled high 
with everything from Greek classics to obscure sci-fi novels.
But Caliban veers away from the more traditional fare you’d find at stores like 
Barnes & Noble. You won’t find Stephen King or Michael Crichton bestsellers on 
its shelves.
“We veer away from that,” said Schulman. “We only carry high-quality materi­
al.”
Caliban’s selective approach to bookselling has earned the loyalty of its clients, 
many of them regulars who stop by during their lunch hours. But their devoted 
clientele is only one part of Caliban’s success.
“Craig Street is a great place,” said assistant manager Kris Collins. “It is a very 
calm street. Craig Street business owners know each other and are supportive 
of each other.”
“There’s a happiness that comes from selling books to people who love books,” 
said Schulman.

History
Located at the intersection of Craig and Forbes, History carries sterling-silver 
jewelry, hand-made crafts, and various new-age products like aromatherapy 
oils and incense.
“We specialize in fashion-forward jewelry, beads, and artifacts,” said store man­
ager Bethany Signor.
Founded 11 years ago, History began by selling mosdy beads and jewelry. As 
business grew, History outgrew its current location and last year opened 
History Bead Trading Co, a second shop selling History’s bead collection.
History has the intimate look and feel of an artsy boutique. The shop is crowd­
ed with Buddha statues, candles, and stuffed animals, and the walls are mount­
ed with an impressive collection of masks from India, Mexico, Africa, and Haiti.
Its visible location has been good for business, as it attracts students from both 
CMU and Pitt, as well as museum-goers from the nearby Carnegie.
“Craig Street has a great atmosphere,” said Signor. “We’ve got a great spot on 
the street, and it’s been fun working here.”

Mandala Bookstore and Wellness
The humble storefront of Mandala Bookstore and Wellness gives little indica­
tion of what waits inside. While patrons might expect an array of books on alter­
native thought and medicine, they certainly won’t be prepared for the cast of 
characters that inhabits this shop.
Frank Carroll mans the cash register in the store’s main showroom. He struggles 
to define the purpose of his store, and explains that the increasing number of 
booksellers in the area saps its vitality as a bookstore.
“Now I sell mostly sideline items like candles and incense,” he said.
The store also sells many different religious and spiritual items. The goal behind 
all of these strange items and books is to promote the understanding of con­
sciousness, according to Carroll. “It’s giving honor to all [different cultures], 
and representing them,” he said. “It’s a store for consciousness in general.”
The silver-haired man speaks about his products with great zeal, delving peri­
odically into discussions of the spirit and the mind.
“Humanity is one spirit, that’s one thing we have to learn,” said Carroll on one 
such occasion. “It’s about trying to conquer the ego.”
Mandala is a haven for alternative schools of spiritual thought. Frances High 
Eagle is the store’s resident medium between the spiritual and physical worlds.
“I talk to spirits more than I talk to people,” said High Eagle. “As a kid I used to 
go to the woods a lot and listen to the energies around me.”
A process of self-instruction and the guidance of Stephanie Simmons, another 
Cherokee shaman, have culminated in High Eagle’s ability to commune with the 
dead. The process is not an easy one, however.
“I have to find out who they are and why they are here and what they want, and 
then I can talk to them,” said High Eagle.
For those interested in spiritual wellness, Mandala hosts a meditation session 
every Thursday night at 7 pm.
Kohli’s World Travel
The influence of India is undeniably present in Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents can be observed playing cricket on the Cut during the warmer months, 
and the name of Sree commands much culinary respect. Kohli’s World Travel 
brings the clothing and jewelry of India to Craig Street.
Soft music and the scent of incense fill Kohli’s as clerk Monika Soi tends shop in 
clothes that look like they were taken from the store’s collection.
“India is the only country wearing their ethnic outfits.... [and] these are all 
designer pieces,” said a proud Soi of her wares.
Indian designers are currendy creating bright and graceful dresses and suits 
instead of working on more contemporary pieces. The traditional style of dress 
is prevalent, but the garments seen could be found anywhere, from the streets 
to music videos. The dresses that hang on Soi’s rack seem like they jumped right 
out of music videos, their shining sequins glittering in the sun as they might 
under television lights.

Irish Design Center
A harried Paul Carey sat behind his cash register poring over credit card receipts 
and inventory reports.
“You’ll have to forgive me, I just got back from Ireland,” he said.
The trip, which put Carey behind in his bookkeeping, is one of many that have 
kept his business ahead for the last 25 years. These trips ensure that his inven­
tory is full of authentic and current Irish items. They also allow Carey to meet 
his suppliers.
“We import everything directly from Ireland,” said soft-spoken Carey. “The 
store runs the gamut of things Irish.”
This variety attracts plenty of customers, as does the Design Center’s impres­
sive storefront. The pane glass window impressively showcases the artifacts for 
sale within and grabs the attention of Craig Street pedestrians. These pedes­
trians are a diverse lot, including everyone from grandmothers to pierced stu­
dents.
“Being between two universities and the museum, we’ve got an eclectic mix,” 
said Carey.
C. Video
When owner Catherine Kelley launched C. Video from 
her house in 1985, it was a mail-order business that sold 
only opera and ballet videos. In 1987, she expanded to a 
store on the South Side.
“The store was formerly a food-distribution center, so I 
got a lot of people who came in asking for bread and 
milk; it was then that I knew I had to move,” said 
Kelley.
In the mid-’90s, Kelley opened C. Video, a movie rental 
store, on Craig Street. Over the years, she expanded to 
include new releases, and in response to student 
demand, she added an anime section.
Nowadays, C. Video carries over 11,000 videos and 
1,000 DVDs, including foreign tides and silent films. 
Being located on Craig Street, Kelley naturally attracts 
professionals and museum-goers, but her favorites are 
the college kids.
“I like students ... they keep the store fresh and 
young, and a lot of them come just to hang out,” she 
said. “There’s a genuine feeling of friendship in the 
store.”
Kelley loves her job so much that she does not consider it 
work.
“I don’t work. I enjoy what I do and am lucky enough to 
make a living out of it.”

Craig Street’s Phantom of the Attic is floor to ceiling comic books.
Phantom of the Attic & Brave New World
A mainstay of Craig Street, Phantom of the Attic, owned by Jeff Yandora, is a haven for comic book 
fans and game lovers. The store has two locations on Craig Street: one sells comic books and DVDs, 
and the other sells board games and card games. Though Phantom has recently expanded, the comic 
book shop is filled to bursting with its ever-burgeoning inventory.
“We get roughly 500 new titles each month, and that includes mainstream comics, graphic novels, 
and smaller-press books,” said assistant manager Wayne Wise.
A highlight of the store is its selection of Japanese manga comics and anime DVDs.
“We cater to a lot of tastes,” said Wise. “But our clients are usually college-age or older.... Since Craig 
is in between the Pitt and CMU campuses, we get a lot of business from the college crowd. If there’s 
a better location for us, I don’t know where it is.”
On the 3rd floor of Yandora’s comic book shop stands Brave New World, a small, crowded music store 
with a large selection of new vinyl, punk rock, heavy metal, and hip-hop.
“We have about five to six thousand different CD titles and about three thousand vinyl,” said man­
ager Sparr Schmitt. “A lot of them are from independent labels.”
A bit farther up Craig Street stands Phantom of the Attic’s game store. A miniature reproduction of 
Helm’s Deep, the fortress in the most recent Lord of the Rings installment, The Two Towers, takes up 
nearly the entire floor space.
“We sell all kinds of board games and card games, but no electronic games,” said assistant manager 
Leonard Yarabeck.
And Yarabeck always follows the trends.
“We also have a lot of children who come for the Collectible Card Games, like Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh.”
ANOTHER SIDE 
OF CRAIG STREET
Not all of the commerce on Craig Street is 
conducted behind flashy and attractive 
storefronts. One man, who withheld his 
name, earns his bread by selling flowers in 
front of the PNC bank on the corner of Craig 
Street and Fifth Avenue.
The flower vendor is a veteran, having ped­
dled his wares off and on for the last twen­
ty years. Business lately, however, has not 
been so good.
“It’s seasonal, it goes with the weather,” he 
said. “Landlords and utilities, they don’t 
want to hear about it being too cold to 
work.”
Corey Robinson works on Craig Street sell­
ing absolutely nothing at all.
“I panhandle money,” he said.
Robinson is happy with his post on Craig 
Street, citing a polite and generous popu­
lace as the source of his content.
“The people of Craig Street help me out a 
lot; they’re nice people."
Robinson spends most of his day on Craig 
Street, from about noon to six in the 
evening. When the day is done he relaxes as 
anyone else might.
“I go to get something to eat, visit friends,” 
he said. But in addition to recreation, 
Robinson’s post-work routine includes the 
search for shelter.
“I sleep outside or in an abandoned 
house.”

How not to heal your mind:
Rodney St. Michael’s new book offers anything but sane advice
ILLUMINATI
Healing and Developing the Mind
RODNEY ST.MICHAEL
In his wisdom, Lewis Carrol — children’s author, creator, and profiteer of the 
Alice in Wonderland stories — knew crazy. His character, the Cheshire Cat, in a 
conversation with the bemused Alice, spares no scintilla of deductive reasoning 
in one of the book’s famous passages. It goes:
“And how do you know that you’re mad?”
“To begin with,” said the Cat. "A dog’s not mad. You grant that?”
“I suppose so,” said Alice.
“Well, then,” the Cat went on. “You see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags 
its tail when it’s pleased. Now, I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when 
I’m angry. Therefore, I’m mad.”
Syllogistically, Illuminati: Healing and Developing the Mind follows a similar 
path. The book, a second installment in the work of Rodney St. Michael, is half 
self-help guide, half celebrity tell-all. The author is a former schizophrenic who 
has found some knowledge and treatment in the indigenous Eastern philoso­
phies, but mainly in a synthesized, potted form of psychological history of his 
own creation. The Alice quote is fetching for several reasons, all relating to the 
basic premise of St. Michael’s book: healing, as an idea and then as a private 
action, can only come about when we realize that nearly all “normal” people 
throughout time were in fact, you guessed it, schizophrenic.
Christ, for example, “might simply have returned to his carpentry following the 
use of modern treatments.” Churchill apparently guided the Allied victory in 
between psychotic episodes; Socrates heard voices. Ditto for Joan of Arc and St. 
Francis of Assisi. Also: “Did you know that some people think that schizophre­
nia is a form of spirit possession, or a close encounter of the third kind, or even 
a mystical channel to the paranormal world?” We are, alas, never allowed to 
know who these “people” are, and are left wondering whether they exist only 
in the mind, or if at all.
But, like the cat, St. Michael’s message is clear — since contemporary schizo­
phrenics are typified by hallucinations and voices in their head, presumably, 
again, from the spirit world, any historical figure who claimed these 
Manichean properties, nearly all of whom are religious icons were, in fact, 
mentally ill.
Ergo, the religious among us, who wag their tails when angry, are just as mad 
as Alice’s interlocutor.
Illuminati might be illuminating if it was not slavishly intent on attacking 
organized religion. Short of peddling the recycled “opiate of the masses” 
canard, St. Michael packs so much of his book with scandalous revelations that 
we never get to the meat of the issue. Constructive criticism is one thing — and 
here, the popular religions are overdue — but this is muck-racking in its most 
sniveling form. To wit: “the Romans called schizophrenics ‘collectively’ as 
‘Bacchus,’ celebrating their deaths with the blood of their ‘divided’ bodies. 
They are then RE-membered via the satanic ritual called ‘Holy Communion’ — 
gathering together to drink bloody wine.” As irreligious and anti-Catholic bias­
es go, this is somewhere in front of Blake’s Law and immediately following Guy 
Fawkes’ Day in the bad-taste hierarchy. And if there was any further doubt, we 
have this: “Whether one considers ancient Egyptian priests, or Pharisees, or 
catholic clergymen, history clearly shows that they often portray angelic peo­
ple as “devils.” Then, [the priests, clergy] elevate themselves to angels despite 
their devilish deeds. Obviously, as the empirical evidence clearly points out, the 
priests and missionaries are lying.” Nowhere in this vitriolic screed are we 
acquainted with schizophrenia, manic-depression, OCD, MPD, ADD, and anxi­
ety disorders, nor how to deal with them. There is only, in its place, some kind 
of rarefied mysticism; priests and rabbis are removed in favor of witches and 
thaumaturgies.
What spare advice there is in St. Michael’s book is never earth-shattering, but 
plainly self-evident. “Be involved in cooperation.. .within the bounds of what is 
humanely possible,” realize that “the world is not perfect;” if your feet gather 
dirt... wash them with humility” — these epigrams are oppressively apparent 
to anyone who has ever read a children’s book, or spent time with the poor, 
weak, and downtrodden. Illuminati, by fact of its fatuity, deserves the kind of 
criticism Mencken volleyed weekly at mountebanks and Christian Scientists 
alike. It’s called quackery, and its agents “gain their converts by the simple 
process of reducing the inordinately complex to the absurdly simple.” And for 
those suffering from mental illness, like St. Michael did, cataloged in his Little 
Voices, the future looks daunting. There are many in this world attempting to 
peddle every manner of nostrum and pseudo-science they can conjure. And, 
unfortunately for the afflicted, a sucker — coined by Barnum but sharpened 
further by Mencken — is born every minute.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
It was November 1946 the next time we met. Quackers had traveled the 
world, somehow avoiding the war, and had won the heart 
of the lovely Quackette. They had been together for well ^ 
over two years when I met up with him in a Paris cafe, but ^ -v 
I was sad to hear that all was not well in this gentleducks M
life. You see, Quackette, beautiful though she was without, 
had turned ill-tempered within, and Quackers felt perpetually rejected. 
Often, she quacked harshly, and hardly ever did she smile for him any­
more. Successful though his ventures had been, Quackers’ life was in 
shambles. I convinced him to leave his plight and to travel with me to the 
Americas. We left the very next morning, catching a boat across the 
Atlantic and traveling by rail from there. She never did say goodbye.

When Nature Calls:
It’s Nature vs. Nurture for the Amazing Spiderman
Peter Parker is a scientist. His origin as Spider-Man has always been attributed to the scien­
tific aftershock of a bite from a radioactive spider. But creators J. Michael Straczynski and 
John Romita Jr. intend to bend that notion of Spider-Man’s scientific inception.
Spiders have always held a prominent place in myth and mysticism. Witchcraft has long been 
associated with Mother Nature’s more sinister sons and daughters, chief among these being 
arachnids. West African myths about the sly spider Kwaku Anansi have spread through the 
African continent and made their way around the world. But Stan Lee’s 20th century myth 
about a young outcast who was transformed into a spider-like champion has always been 
credited to modern science.
The mystical, and often ignored, element of Spider-Man’s origin is just what the Amazing 
Spider-Man’s authors have begun to explore. Since the beginning of his run nearly two years 
ago, Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski — better known as JMS —- has introduced a 
slew of new characters who flirt with Peter Parker’s totemistic side. Many of these characters 
and events are just beginning to gel into one big master plan. JMS’s creative partner John 
Romita Jr. is an experienced Spider-Man veteran who has illustrated the red and blue cru­
sader for some 20-odd years. JR Jr. prides himself on his storytelling talents, which have 
recently adapted to accommodate the influx of spider-based themes. Now more than ever, 
Spider-Man walks and talks his namesake.
Next up is Amazing Spider-Man #50. This issue centers on Peter and Mary Jane’s fractured 
relationship, but it’s doubtful that romance will stop JMS and JR Jr. from furthering the 
arachnid elements of Spider-Man’s saga. Issues #48 and #49 have hinted at an impending 
tempest of trouble for Peter Parker’s alter ego. The magic of the spider bite, and not the sci­
ence, will be the focus for sure. This is a great time for long-time readers and newfound fans; 
the past twenty issues by Straczynski and Romita, Jr. have been weaving exciting webs of 
intrigue for Marvel Comics’ flagship hero. It doesn’t take spider-sense to know that the tales 
will continue to consume readers’ imaginations as Spider-Man spins into the future.

8 Mile
(THURSDAY)
We had no reason to doubt Eminem's ability to produce a raw, 
real performance in a movie in which he plays himself. 8 Mile 
follows the life of an aspiring white boy rapper who struggles to 
prove himself worthy of acceptance in black hip-hop culture. 
Look forward to heart-pounding rap battles between Eminem 
and his competitors. They’re much more satisfying than watch­
ing Britney in Crossroads. Trust me.
The Truth About Charlie
(FRIDAY)
The breakdown: a woman wants to divorce her husband in 
Paris, but she can't because he is dead. She also finds out that 
all the money they have has disappeared. Mark Wahlberg shows 
up, claiming that this money was his and that he now wants it 
back, and chases her all over Paris, convinced that she is hid­
ing his money.
The Ring
(SATURDAY)
Me-. Hey Roger, have you ever seen that movie The Ring? 
Roger: Yeah. Creeeeppppyyy as shit.
Me: Can I quote you on that?
Roger: Sure. Though not in the context that will make it look 
like I think shit is creepy.
Me: Like, what is the ring? A piece of jewelry? A ring of twigs? 
Roger: It's something you see before you die. This horror movie 
is wonderfully well-crafted; often, the fright comes from subtle 
psychological clues, but there's a fair share of jump-out-of-your- 
seat moments. Naomi Watts delivers a great performance, and 
the supporting actors are good, but the star is the imagery that 
creeps its way into every scene through the floorboards. Based 
on the mega-blockbuster Japanese horror movie Ringu, and 
encompassing some material from its overseas sequejs, the film 
remains faithful to the plot of the original. But The Ring adds 
the sheen of high production value. It’s a truly frightening and 
watch-worthy movie.
Me: Thanks. You just wrote my review.
Ebola Syndrome
(SUNDAY)
God. I don't know. This movie is from Hong Kong and is just 
weird. A man contracts the Ebola Virus from his visit to South 
Africa after he sleeps with a Zulu lady. He then returns to the 
restaurant he works at and kills people, chopping and frying 
them up as hamburgers, causing an Ebola epidemic.
PILLBOX. 3 FEBRUARY 2003.1

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21- April 19): Despite what reliable sources say, 
you will continue to pray for truth in the rumor that Mary-Kate 
and Ashley Olsen are coming to Carnegie Mellon as math 
majors. You will bleach your hair and 
watch hours upon hours of their movies 
and old episodes of Full House while con­
stantly checking their website for Olsen 
status updates and great fashion tips.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): After crossing 
Craig Street once too often, it will take an 
embarrassingly long time for you to realize that not all walk sig­
nals are accompanied by a friendly beep, you Pavlovian lemming.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Don't worry about the severity of 
your love of taxidermy impinging on your social life. People 
would actually have to visit you to find out about it anyway.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Your natural inability to blink 
combined with your heavy CS course load will soon lead to tem­
porary programming-induced color blindness.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): While your love of cats may slightly 
injure your popularity, your love for Cat Stevens will really do 
you in.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Your parents' credit card 
will continue to provide you with trendy, fashionable, top-quali- 
ty clothes sewn by the most highly-skilled child laborers abroad.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Despite what you may 
think, not everyone is out to get you. That would require them 
considering your well-being.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): The factory workers 
welcome you with open arms. However, while your years of 
studying mechanical engineering qualify you for the assembly 
line job, a managerial position requires 
actual verbal skills.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 -
December 21): The hula hoop festival 
you've been planning for a year will be 
cancelled due to inclement weather and a 
lack of coordinated participants.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Your economics 
career will hit a snag when you fail to understand that rapid 
inflation doesn't make everyone rich quick.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You will continue to 
have no idea what you're missing.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Relax. Earth's first contact 
with intelligent extraterrestrial life forms will not be tarnished 
by the alien pilot with bad parallel park­
ing skills and poor depth perception 
who accidentally squishes you under his 
cheap, rented flying saucer.
