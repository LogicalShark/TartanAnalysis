COME IN COSTUME 
MARDI GRAS
VOL. XV NO. 27CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.MAY 11, 1921
Parade Tomorrow Opens 
Carnegie Tech’s Second 
Annual Campus Week
Vaudeville Show Thursday Morning-Musical Concert at 
Night—Sweepstakes Friday and Big Mardi Gras—Then 
Tech’s Three-Ring Circus on Saturday
Plans for the Campus Week Parade 
are gradually rounding into shape and 
the various classes are making ar­
rangements to be represented by three 
or four machines each while each of 
the four divisions are working on de­
signs for floats characteric o£ the in­
stitute. It is the desire of the com­
mittee to make the parade a dignified 
demonstration to the Pittsburgh pub­
lic as an advertisement of Campus 
Week and of Carnegie Tech.
If you do not know what your class 
is doing see your class president as 
he may not have made plans or ap­
pointed a committee to work up your 
part. It is up to you, to see that those 
things done in the name of Carnegie 
Tech are a success and the only way 
they will be is to take part. Do not 
let some one else do it.
The general plan is to have as many 
people in each class as have machines 
to offer, to carry ais many of their 
classmates as possible and that every' 
one in that class to wear some dis­
tinctive drdss. For example, the Art 
Plebes might all wear green smocks.
Plebe caps and large bow ties, while 
the M. M. D. ^ophs might ail wear 
white sailor hats with red ribbons, 
and the Science Juniors might wear 
straw hats with some particular kind 
of hat band, while the Seniors of the 
Division of Industries might . carry 
large rolls, like diplomas and wear
caps and gowns. The machines of 
the various classes are to be marked 
with uniform signs to be provided by 
the classes themselves, such as Sci­
ence Sophomores or M. M. D. Juniors. 
These are, of course, only suggestions 
as to costumes that the various class­
es might get an idea as to what is 
wanted and then work up something 
that will distinguish them. It is not 
necessary to have elaborate costumes 
as a very good effect may be had by 
having large numbers of people in 
some -uniform attire. This will also 
make the parade look like something 
more than a crowd of college boys out 
on a joy ride which the people of 
Pittsburgh are rather tired of seeing. 
We want the public to know that 
when Tech does a job they do it in a 
big way ajid that 'Campus Week with 
the circus is being conducted in a well 
organized manner. Now help put 
Campus Week before our Pittsburgh 
friends and alumni by making this 
parade, a success.
The general committee on the pa­
rade will supply special signs and 
banners to be put on machines ad­
vertising Campus Week with its vari­
ous events. It is also arranging a 
truck to carry the band and if the 
Circus Committee can get some stunts 
in the proper shape that they can be 
exhibited on trucks they will also be 
in line.
MARDIGRAS WILL BE 
BIG FEATURE OF WEEK
The Mardi Gras on Friday evening 
of Campus Week is going to be new,, 
new in idea here, new in place of 
holding, new in arrangement.
It will be held in the street in front 
of the Design lawn. There will be un­
usual lighting arrangements on both 
sides of the street.
The concessions will be alongside 
and all sorts of things will be sold, in­
cluding the necessary confetti, bal­
loons and paper caps.
The men and girls are supposed to 
come alone and get mingled up in the 
crowd. Of course everyone will be 
In costume, in fact, no one is admit­
ted without one, and it is hoped that 
every one will mask. The gayety and 
freedom of the affair will be helped 
a thousand-fold i;f the faces are hid­
den. Every one will feel freer to take 
a chance. It’s great sport to see a 
pretty girl in a mask, flirt with her, 
dance with her, see another and leave 
her. No outsider will be allowed in. 
Every one is advised to wear his or 
her campus week tog on that account.
The general hilarity outdoors will 
start at 8. The band will be there to 
help. Dancing will begin in the Union 
and Langly Laboratory at 9. The crowd 
will move in and out of the two build­
ing and in the street at will.
Stunts will be given now and then, 
here and there in the street.
If it rains everything will be taken 
inside and the fun will-continue.
Well, the evening can’t be written 
up. If every one imagines a mixture 
of Belgium Kirmis, Italian Mardi Gras 
and general hilarity, he will begin to 
get an idea of what the evening will 
be like.
But we can’t have a boisterous good 
time unless every one come^ and 
helps and shares. Every one is ex­
pected to get into the untrammeled 
spirit of the thing.
Come on, every one, girls and boys, 
take a chance! Columbus did, and 
see what happened.
Boys,: do your part in seeing that the 
girls receive proper attention and 
have escorts home.
CAMPUS WEEK PARADE
WEAR YOUR TAG
Many of our students when ap­
proached to buy Campus Week tags, 
offered the excuse that ‘‘they had left 
their tags home.’’ These tags are 
primarily to advertise and support 
Campus Week. Every student should 
wear his or her tag where everyone 
will see it; it isn’t a thing to be 
ashamed of, let people know that you 
are from Tech and are in back of 
Tech’s biggest event. In order to de­
termine how many students have 
bought tags, next Wednesday, May 
11, will be designated as Tag Day. 
Anyone not wearing a tag will be ap­
proached by salesmen.
Wear your tag Wednesday and boost 
^ch!
Campus Week—three days of real 
school celebration. Beginning tomor­
row at 10:30, there will be something 
doing every minute, until late Satur­
day night. Put away your books, Blip 
your slide rule out of sight. Forget 
the charrettes and don't worry about 
the work that should be done. For 
this period, you are not at work, but 
at play. There will be alumni here 
who have been out into the world of 
work, and are returning to enjoy the 
school again. We must see that,they 
are entertained and made welcome. 
Three consecutive red leuer days 
which have been anticipated by all 
concerned, as the biggest days ever 
planned at Tech. There will probably 
be more people here than have ever 
assembled on the campus before. The 
most ambitious and extensive pro­
gram that has ever been attempted 
will be presented.
The. students will rub elbows with 
old “grads” and the faculty, older peo­
ple who will again be young men and 
women; just for three days. The dom­
inating idea .will be that of a good 
time, and if you don’t have it blame 
yourself, for joy and mirth will be in 
abundance—so help yourself. The 
only restriction is, be "Tech” students 
and .don’t do anything that will reflect 
any bad impression of our school be­
fore the visitors:
The committee which is in charge 
of the affair has been working hard 
to make this a success, and it is up 
to the students to enter into the spirit 
of the occasion and put the whole af­
fair over big.
It is impossible to outline the pro­
gram in detail. Only some of the 
dominating features can be mentioned. 
The feature events will be the “Yod- 
ville’ show, parade, musical festival, 
sw-eepstakes, mardi gras, athletic 
events and circus. In addition there 
will be many other events too numer­
ous tp mention all of which will go 
to make up one big time. One big 
festival for all Tech.
“Tag Day” will hereafter be known 
as “The Call.” This is the new name 
of the exercises during which the 
members of the honor societies are 
selected. These men have \york In 
activities in school which are worthy 
of recognition. Their names will be 
announced and they will step out of 
the student group to receive credit 
and honor which to them is due. No 
monetary remuneration, only the in­
tangible gratitude of their Alma 
Mater.
In many schools this is known as 
tag day exercises because the men 
are actually tapped but because tills 
has not been the practice here, the 
new name will be more appropriate.
FIFTY NEW SCHOLARSHIPS
Fifty new scholarships will be 
given next fall by the institute to new 
students who are graduates from high 
schools of Pittsburgh. The awards 
will be based on certain qualifications 
the principal requirement being schol­
arship. Each scholarship amounts to 
four hundred dollars, deducted from 
the tuition at the rate of one hundred 
dollars a year. This will take the 
place of the reduced rate to Pitts­
burgh students and this special Pitts­
burgh district tuition will be elimin.- 
afced.
ANNOUNCEMENT MADE
OF RAISE IN TUITION
An increase'of twenty-five dollars 
per year in tuition for all day stu­
dents was announced before a special 
meeting of the students held Wednes­
day. In addition to an increase in 
tuition there )vill be installed a labor­
atory fee of twenty dollars per year 
affecting all students, an increase in 
the Student Activity Fee of five dol­
lars, and a rental charge on each lock­
er of one dollar per year.
With but one of two things to do— 
either cut down on the number of 
courses offered and close certain divi­
sions, or increase the tuition—a com­
mittee made up of students, faculty 
and others concerned in the matter 
decided on the latter.
President Hamerschlag presented 
the matter concerning the financial 
condition of the school in straight­
forward manner to the student body 
and asked their individual considera­
tion of it. To keep the school run­
ning on its present basis will require 
a new endowment of eight or ten mil­
lion dollars In addition to the student 
fees and every one will probably, upon' 
careful consideration of the matter, 
agree that the increase is necessary 
and justifiable. The tuition in almost 
all privately endowed institutions 
ranges from three hundred to three 
hundred and fifty dollars. Owing to 
the fact that the tuition here has in 
the past been below the average as 
compared with other institutions of 
learning of equally high standard, the 
increase will at first thought appear 
greater than It roally is.
The deplorable condition in the 
school concerning property rights 
was also taken up by the president 
and his suggestion of a vigilance com­
mittee to search out the destructors 
of the school property deserves the 
consideration of the whole student 
body. It Is up to each one of us, in­
dividually, to be an active member of 
this committee.
President Hamerschlag also assures 
us that he is behind "Campus Week” 
and will help the student body to 
make it an "eye-opener” for the al­
umni, the Pittsburgh public, and the 
faculty, as well as aid us in "squech- 
ing the knocker” during the three 
days of celebration.
A complete survey of all clubs and 
societies on the campus was an­
nounced by Mr. 'Nichol, who reported 
that in order to concentrate activities 
where they would do the most good 
all clubs and societies will be requir­
ed to file with Mr. C. B. Schmidt, a 
copy of the constitution, list of ac­
tive members, aims and accomplish­
ments and general statement regard­
ing the present status of the club.

If anyone has been around school 
since nineteen-eighteen they remem­
ber The Shilling. If not, they know 
of The Shilling only as a piece of 
exchange in common use in England.
Allow us to inform the world in 
general that The Shilling is a little 
magazine formerly publishedv by the 
students of Margaret Morrison, now 
in charge of the Editorial Depart­
ment.
A committee is working now on 
nominations for the Board of 
Editors, made up of an editor-in-chief, 
from the incoming Senior class, and 
six others from the incoming Juniors 
and Sophomores.
It is the aim of The Shilling to fur­
nish an opportunity for the publica­
tion of worth-while manuscripts 
around school, to establish a better 
understanding of work done by every 
department, and to interest those of 
departments other than the editorial, 
in this particular brand of literature.
The organization is taken up under 
the advice of Mrs. Vermordsen and 
Doctor McLeod, each of whom has 
made invaluable suggestions. The 
Shilling will issue its first number un­
der the'new management next fall. 
It is our earnest desire that the en­
tire school will be interested in the 
effort—interested to the extent of 
contributing any matter which may 
be of Interest to the school at large.
Saturday afternoon, on the Sclren- 
ley Oval track, (Carnegie Tech tri­
umphed over Allegheny College with 
a total of SG points against 40 scored 
by the Meadville ¡College.
The track events were almost en­
tirely captured by the wearers of the 
Plaid, who ronipefi away with the first 
and second places in the 100-yard 
j dash, mile run, 220-yard dash, 440- 
yard dash, half mile run and the two- 
mile run. The Teoli athletes scored 
first in the broad jump, pole vault and 
discus.
The Plaid teams showed up well in 
both, track and field events', making 
records which were exceptionally 
good, and by placing first and second 
in the first events, clinched the meet 
at the start.
Kelly made the 100 yards in 10 1-5, 
and the 220 yards In 22 4-5, both of 
which are fast time, excelled by few.
Miller proved* his ability as a dis­
tance man, winning both the mile and 
two-mile runs. Nichol made good
time, running the half mile in 2:08 1-5.
In the field events Schllllnger
helped himself to the discus, throw­
ing it 116 feet, hi« nearest competitor 
throwing it 104 feet. Hamman, Bur­
dick and Bock took all three places In 
the broad jump.
In conjunction with the Tech Alle­
gheny meet, the annual lnterscholastlc 
meet was held, the leading high
schools of this section competing. The 
meet was won by Peabody, Akron,

Point System For Student 
Activities to Become 
Effective Next Year
Not More Than 20 Points Per Man, Except on Special Re­
quest to Student Council. Two Necessary For Graduation
10 POINTS, HIGHEST GIVEN IN ANY ACTIVITY
The point system is the solution of 
the problem of regulating the extent 
to which a student may participate in 
campus activities. It acts as a pro­
tection to both students and adminis­
tration and at the same time automat­
ically forces otherwise disinterested 
students to take part In the life of 
tho college.
Under tho point system the follow­
ing provisions shall apply:
No studont may acquire more than 
twenty points during the course of 
one college year, except in case a stu­
dent is a member of one or more ath­
letic teams. If at. this time his activ­
ities amount to 20 points or nearly so 
ho may bo pormltted to Increase tho 
number to a small number above 20 
by the addition of one extra position 
or oillco.
If at any tlmo it should bocomo noc- 
ossary that a student bo permitted to 
hold more than the maximum 20 
points for any othor roason as statod 
above, application shall bo mado In 
writing to tho studont council stating 
roasons, otc., and permission may tie 
grantod upon recommendation of fac­
ulty.
It shall bo required of each studont 
to acquire'a minimum of two points 
In activities at some tlmo boforo be­
ing granted a dogroe from tho college.
If at any time a studont exceeds 
the maximum of twonty points with­
out tho required permission ho shall 
bo required to resign from all offices 
and positions in excess of twenty 
points he then holds, and shall be 
Ineligible for them or any other In 
excess of twenty during the . remain­
der of tho current year.
Clubs ami societies inontloned bore- 
In do not Include fraternities of any 
kind.
This point system may bo amended 
by action of tho student council.
General college committees are de­
fined as those covering activities eon- 
corning tho college In goneral are ap­
pointed by the Studont Council. Di­
vision committees concern a division 
alone and are appointed by the prop­
er division authorities. Class commit­
tees govern classes and are appoint­
ed by the class president.
An assistant) athletic manager is 
dofined as one who has been appoint­
ed as such by proper athletic authori­
ties. A candidate for assistant man­
ager Is ono who has announced him­
self as such a lid is considered by tho 
manager and coach as being sulll- 
clently interested In the work to do- 
servo consideration for appointment,

UNCLAIMED THISTLES
TO BE SOLD THIS WEEK
The 1921 Thistle still has on file 
over two hundred uncalled for sub­
scriptions. This Is due probably to 
the carelessness of some of the,stu­
dents who imagine their books can 
stay In the office indefinitely until 
called for. In some cases the book 
may not lie wanted, In which event, 
the receipt should bo sold to some one 
who Is on the waiting list, ' /
In order to cleat! up tho suibscrlp- 
tlonu* before examinations the sales 
manager will sell all unclaimed books, 
beginning next week, to the numer­
ous students who did not subscribe at 
tho first of the yoar. Ilecelpts for tbo 
books thus Hold will be redoemod at 
face value,
The office will be open every noon 
from 12:30 to 1:30 and all Tuesday 
afternoon, to accommodate those stu­
dents who do not wish their books 
sold.

PETTY THIEVERY
That present social conditions in the country at large arc re­
flected in college lil’e is always to be expected. Just now, as we all 
know, these conditions are not all that could be desired, and their 
effect is clearly shown by the wave of petty thievery which has be­
come such a menace during the last few months. Over twenty-five 
sets ol: drawing instruments, -a valuable violin, several coats, furs, 
watches, jewelry and sums of money are among the articles which 
have been stolen recently.
i The matter was taken up at a recent meeting ol! the Student 
Council, and it was decided that the only practical way to combat 
the thieving was to urge both the students and the faculty to consti­
tute themselves a vigilance committee, for everyone to keep his eyes 
open for lost articles, and for those taking them. The buildings are 
open, of course, and it is possible for anyone to get into almost any 
part of the divisions at any hour of the day. Thus many opportu­
nities are open for outsiders to take whatever may be left carelessly 
laying around. It docs not s'eem likely that the students are the 
persons to blame, when these conditions exist, but it will pay us all 
to watch for the culprits, both for the good name of ourselves and 
that of the Institution.
In case of anyone finding any clues leading him to believe that 
lie has a line on any thefts, it is urgently requested that he report 
the matter to Colonel Fairley, Superintendent of Buildings and 
Grounds, immediately, so that action can be taken at once. Any loss 
should also be rcported, so that it may be investigated.
(
I’resident Hamerschlag has received a letter under date of 
pril 30th from Superintendent George W. Burke, Bureau ol! Parks, 
/ity of Pittsburgh, in which he desires it brought to the attention 
' of our student body that owing to the great demand for the munici­
pal tennis courts in Sehenley Park from residents of Pittsburgh, 
permits cannot be issued to persons whose liom’cs are outside of the 
City of Pittsburgh.
DID YOU GET ONE?
I ----------------Two weeks ago notices were sent out to about, 500 students re­
sting that they pay up their $1.25 Tartan assessment, This as- 
p.jjueni; was passed by the Board,of, Student Activities, last spring.
is Is u14r.l1/''Viv*. year the Tartan has been distributed I'rce and on 
time «»very Wednesday /morning. Nearly 50 per cent more space 
has been devoted to ntiws than formerly. And this year’s printing 
rates have boon the highest ever known. The assessment was made 
25c lower than the former price. Now it is up to every student who 
has not paid to do his share. 11' everyone paid his bill the Tartan 
would have money left over l!or the Student Activities Board. As i.t is, 
the Student Activities Board will liaye to appropriate money to 
meet the expenses ol! the Tartan when this money should go into 
other student interests. When you’ve had yo'ur money’s worth all 
year, and the other fellows have paid, hadn’t you botttor pay up?

GIRLS’ HOME CONIERT
VERY WELL RECEIVED
Saturday night at the Pittsburgh 
Conservatory of Music, the Girls’. Mu­
sical Clubs held their second annual 
home concert and dance. From "Dear. 
Old Carnegie," in the first part, to 
"Dear Old Tech,” in the last, the con­
cert was well received. Especially so 
was a solo part by Laura Bugher and 
the encore numbers done by Mary 
McCloskey, Anna Weber, Gladys Rich­
mond and Betty Kindler.
The apeciulty, done by Lillian Cow­
an, Florence Lutz, Dorothy Turkic, 
Gladys Richmond, Marion McCombs, 
Isabel Winner, Miriam Bond, Vir­
ginia Moorman, Eleanora Schomberg 
and Eleanor Craver, was the, feature 
of the program, and was very effec­
tive.
After the concert Harrison Hollins 
furnished music for the dance and "a 
good time was had by all."
SECRETARIAL DEPART­
MENT ORGANIZES
A week ago the Margaret Morrison 
lunch room was a gala scene. Mem­
bers of the Secretarial Department 
were getting together and enjoying 
the Ilnest meal “ever known in these 
parts.” We could give you the menu, 
but you miglu get jealous. •
After everyone had finished eating 
their devil’s food and ice cream cov­
ered with thick chocolate sauce, they 
adjourned to the Recitation I-Iall, 
where Mr. Page, the head of our der 
partment, and Mr. Hawes carried 011 
a little parody on Parliamentary Law. 
The Secretarial Department was or­
ganizing. After some discussion and 
a little voting the following oilicers 
were elected: President, Helen Hes­
ter; vice president, Helen McConkey; 
secretary-treasurer, Thelma Adams; 
social chairman, Ruth Sehenck.
CAMPUS WEEK PROGRESS
The Circus of Campus Week prom­
ises to be a regular eye-opener It’ the 
costumes worn by the performers can 
he taken as a sample. About a half 
dozen of the circus performers were 
trying 011 costumes last week that 
were made by Hans Muller and from 
their appearance it looked as though 
the circus had isome regular stunits 
that ltingling Brothers might envy. 
Art Leet. lias been working hard and 
has a few good acts lined up, but is 
still looking for some more. He would 
like to iind a couple of good jugglers 
for a special act,'lin’d a few 111011 that 
are good at gymnastic stunts.
Miss Mary McCombs and Miss- Mary 
Curry aro going to • put on a special 
dance at. the Mardi Gras which they 
have boon practicing. Their costumes 
have been specially designed for the 
occasion and are extremely attractive. 
Besides those girls there are two 
Others who have a very clover black- 
laced act that is to bo ono of the ijpo- 
clal foaturos of the Mardi Gras festiv­
ities. The two taking part in tills act 
are Eleanor Foster and Isabol Win­
ner.
EAGLE8MERE PEP MEET-
ING—Y. W. C. A.
Kvoryono would like so much to go 
to Eaglosmore—there’s not a girl in 
Margaret Morrison who wouldn't like 
to spend ten beautiful days I11 the 
mountains, thinking, hiking, swim­
ming, rowing, hearing about the stu­
dents of the world and talking with 
girls of fifty other colleges In sur­
rounding states. Wednesday after­
noon at. *1:80 Is the time set, for our 
Eaglosmore pep meeting and the time 
when everyone interested can hear 
about it—see pictures of it and learn 
to love it. Every girl leaves Eagles- 
more ibetter, more beautiful, and 
closer to her ideal self than ever be­
fore. If you haven’t been interested be­
fore—come and we guarantee you will 
be. Perhaps, if you can’t go this year, 
that you may work toward its beauti­
ful realization next year.
BRIGHT OUTLOOKFOR TENNIS TEAM
The Carnegie Tech tennis team has 
a very bright outlook for the com­
ing season, according to Captain John 
C. Harknesa. He looks forward to a 
very successful season.
"The material which has come out 
for the tennis team this year is much 
bettor than we had dared hope. Un­
der the coaching of Colonel Brooks, 
the chances look very good for Tech, 
to again win the Western Pennsylva­
nia championship,” says Captain 
Harkness.
The team has, in Harkness, an able 
leader and a player of tested ability. 
Harkness, while in preparatory
school, played on the team at John B. 
Stetson University, D^land, Florida.
In his sophomore year at Tech, he 
represented the school on the court 
and was awarded his letter, repeating 
this in his junior year! HarkneBs has 
proven that he is capable of leading 
the team which inis always been 
Tech’s pride, in that the teams have 
been the best produced by any college 
in this locality and as good as any 
produced anywhere.

PATRONIZE OUR ADVERTISERS-
Are you going to be a “drop- 
forged engineer?
There are thousands of that kind and, soon or late, they learn 
•with a shock that they can get just about so far, and no further
EP”M!rr big eastern uni­
versity engineering societies 
held a joint meeting recent­
ly. They were alumni men 
of technical colleges. And 
they met to discuss the out­
look of the college trained 
engineer.
“The trouble,” said a 
speaker, “is that too many 
of us are ‘drop-forged’ en­
gineers. We know our pro­
fession; but of Business, to 
which it is so closely re­
lated—we just don’t know 
what it’s all about.”
In the files of the Alexander 
Hamilton Institute is the story 
of a graduate of a great en­
gineering college. With all his 
training and. his degree, he was 
a “drop-forged” engineer.
“When I left college I did 
not know the ABCof how 
to consider even the sim­
plest of business problems,” 
lie wrote.
Upon leaving college, he started 
to work as an engineer for a big 
technical firm at $70 a month. 
He is still with that firm. And 
this is what he writes:
“Today I am part owner of 
the finn and sole manager 
of it.. This hasn't, been due 
io luck by any means’, but 
simply by putting into prac­
tice what anyone can get 
from the Modern Business 
Course and Service of the
Alexander Hamilton Insti­
tute.”
It is not enough to know the 
technical side alone
The director of a western en­
gineering college said recently: 
“The most dominant character­
istic of the engineering profes­
sion is the preponderance of the 
commercial over the technical.”
Step by step, the engineering 
enterprises that achieve big suc­
cess, and make careers for en­
gineers, are guided by the same 
fundamental laws and practices 
that rule modern business. And 
thousands of engineers have 
learned by bitter experience that 
without business training, tech­
nical training carries a man just 
about so far, and no farther.
A Course whose product is 
understanding
The Alexander Hamilton In­
stitute was founded by a 
group of business men and edu­
cators who realized that modern 
business was developing special­
ists, but not executives; that 
somehow more men must be 
taught the fundamentals that 
underlie the operations of every 
department of business.
The Institute has only one 
Course. It takes a man out of 
college and gives him a working 
knowledge of all the depart­
ments of business.
Such a man receives in a few 
months of reading what ordinari­
ly would consume years of prac­
tical experience. He finds in the 
Institute a more direct path
from where he is to where he 
wants to be. He has the satis­
faction of carrying large respon­
sibilities while he is still young. 
Naturally and inevitably he 
earns more than the average, 
man of the same years and 
education.
For the “drop-forged” en­
gineer, who asks himself “Where 
am I going to be five years from 
now?” the Alexander Hamilton 
Institute has an encouraging 
story to tell. It is the story of 
the thousands of successful col­
lege men—many of them en­
gineers—who have saved the 
wasted years; men who, thru. 
the Course and Service, have 
added to their technical equip­
ment the training which makes 
them understand what business 
is all about.
“Forging Ahead in Business’*
"Forging Ahead in Business” is a 116- 
page book especially prepared for men 
who are taking stock of their prospects 
and wondering what the future may hold 
for them. It is not a book for idlers, or 
men of feeble purpose. But to men who 
seriously want to lenow what the Course 
has done for others in positions like their 
own, the book will be a revelation. It

PANAMA CANAL EMERGENCY DAMS
G
ATUN LAKE, eighty-five feet above sea 
level, is the reservoir holding the water to feed the Gatun Locks (which lead to the 
Atlantic) and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel 
locks on the Pacific end of the Canal.
Every ship going through the canal in either 
direction use6 the water from Gatun Lake to 
lift it from the one ocean and lower it into the other. Should some accident destroy a lock, 
the weight of water released might force down the others and cause tremendous damage and, 
by lowering the level of the lake, make the 
canal inoperative until rain had refilled the lake. 
Therefore these big emergency dams were con­
structed. Normally they arc not used. In »•mergencies they would be swung over the 
locks, the gates would drop into position and 
effectually dam the opening,

On The Plaid Screen
BY STUART P. SMITH
“THE FLYING DUTCHMAN”
The opening game at Forbes Field between the Pittsburgh Pirates, and 
the Cincinnati Red Sox, began when Honus Wagner, the old-time champion 
short stop of the Pirates, pitched the first ball. “Honus” Is the coach of the 
Tech baseball team and Tech is mighty fortunate to have him. Those who 
have been down at the Tech Field watching practice, and have seen the 
former Pirate perform, will bear out the statement, that he has lost very 
little of his speed and his batting eye is apparently as good as ever. The 
record of the baseball team so far this season has proven that Wagner is a 
real coach.
TENNIS
Afternoons, on the Margaret Morrison Courts, the Tech varsity tennis 
team may be seen in action. Even an untutored observer can readily see 
that the boys are right at home on the courts, and the manner in which some 
of them handle a racquet is short of wonderful. Colonel Brooks, while hav­
ing nearly all new men to choose from, to represent Tech, has a squad which 
the school may be proud of, and from which to expect a record as good as 
the record made last year, by the wearers of the Plaid.
GOLF (?)
An unusual phase of athletics is about to be introduced at Carnegie Tech 
in the form of a golf team. The team will not be supported by the activities 
board like the teams in other sports, but will be carried along by the mem­
bers themselves, who are anxious to make a golf team a permanent fixture 
at the school. Matches will be played with teams representing clubs in 
and around Pittsburgh. Those interested should make it a point to get into 
communication with the manager of this team, at once.
RIFLE CLUB FINISHES
SUCCESSFUL SEASON
The Rifle team has finished its 
first season with the decisive Colgate 
match. The team score made—495 
out of a possible 500—is an indication 
of what can and will be done if the 
team is given support. The team will 
lose only one man by graduation out 
of the 12 men who are perfect scoie 
material. A lot of credit is due the 
men who have put the thing across for 
its. first year as a success. Rifle has 
not yet been recognized as a minor

PUSHMOBILES ALL SET
FOR GRAND SWEEPSTAKE
One of the features of Campus 
Week will 7be the Tnterfratemity 
Sweepstakes. On Friday morning, 
May 13, the various entries from the 
fraternities will line up in readiness 
to race, for the coveted trophy offer­
ed to the winner. The Kentucky Der­
by or the Epsom Downs annual cla'ssic 
hold little interest to the Tech stu­
dents as compared with this mam­
moth pushmobile. race. Each entry 
consists of two men and a pushmo- 
bile. One man sits in the car and 
the other man pushes the car and 
rider. This introduction of the hu­
man element makes the betting very 
interesting.
TECH 6, GROVE CITY 0 TENNIS THIS TIME
Grove City came; Grove City saw; 
and Grove City was conquered—with 
all duo apologies to Mr. Julius Caesar 
of the "B. C. days.” All of which, 
spoken in real language, means that 
the Grove City College tonnis team 
lost a complete set of games and 
matches comprising a tournament 
with the Carnegie Tech tennis team. 
The Tech team showed that they have 
the real goods when it comes to play­
ing tennis. The Grove City team, 
while showing that they have not the 
ability of the Tech players, neverthe­
less showed that they have the mak­
ings of a good team; they were in the 
game all the way through, fighting 
every bit of the way—but, to what 
avail? Not much! Tech wins six 
matches to nothing for Grove City.
For Tech, the order of play was 
Kell as first man, Neville as number 
two, Captain Harkness playing num­
ber three, with Schwartz as number 
four. In the doubles, Kell and Neville 
played the first team, and Harkness 
and Schwartz played number two. 
That the above arrangement was 
ideal was conclusively shown by the 
decisive manner in which they walked 
over Grove City.
In Individual play all men came 
fully up to what was expected of them. 
Kell played his usual dependable 
game, winning handily. 6-2, 6-2. More- 
ledge for Grovo City was erratic, 
which was caused more than likely 
by Kell’s easy and high-bouncing re­
turns—such a ball being very hard to 
play successfully. But towards the 
latter part of the match, Moreledge 
began getting his drives good, and In 
this manner caused many rallies' of 
much Interest to the gallery. Kell's 
game consistod of sorvlng very well 
to I he corners, and taking the not. 
and there winning the point by a clev­
erly placed shot to the side.
Neville In winning (5-1, 0-1 from 
Parker showed without a doubt the 
best tonnis of the two tonnis. His 
driving both forward and bitck was 
wonderful and beautiful to watch. 
Parker for. Gi'.oVo City showed a hard 
serve, but an Inability to. follow up. 
Neville’s drive to the sldo line wore 
unreturnable, which accounted for Ills 
winning.
Captain Harkness defeated Monroe 
(¡•2, 6-2. The. match was Avon on suc­
cessfully using the chop-stroke,. and 
generally, out-playing his man.
Schwartz wins 6-1, 6-4 over Clarke,
INTER-FRATERNITY CONFER.
ENCE INDORSES R. O. T. C.
It is the desire of the Military De­
partment to call attention to the fol­
lowing resolution adopted at the an­
nual session in Decembor, 1920, of the 
Inter-Fraternity Conference, compris­
ing ollicial representatives from 46 
moil’s college fraternities in the United, 
States, siz:
“Whereas, the Reserve . Officers’ 
Training Corps is a provision of the 
law of the United States for the
training and development of the
young men in colleges as officers for
the Reserve Corps; and 
“Whereas, the Reserve Officers' 
Training Corps is a very important 
element in the preparedness of our 
country for self-defense;
“Be it resolved that the Inter- 
Fraternity Conference publicly in- 
lorses the Reserve Officers’ Training 
Corps and recommends that all
fraternities associated with this con­
ference urge their members to sup­
port the Reserve Oillcers’ Training 
Corps in their institutions and indi­
vidually to bo active members thereof.
“The motion was unanimously 
passed.”
in view of the great influence ex­
ercised in colleges and universities by 
the fraternities and the fact tluit tlio 
Intor-Fralernity Conference includes 
tlio leading and ‘most important 
fraternities found in the American 
colleges, tills action is.of real signifi-
of Grovo City. Schwartz’s soi‘ve was 
good, Ills drive good, it being mostly 
a chop-stroko, but with speed, and 
his over-head playing very good. Ho 
would clovorly draw his opponent out 
of the court, and then kill with deadly 
accuracy. Clarke showed a hard serv­
ice, but an Inability to follow-up.
In the doubles, Koll and Novillo de­
feated Parker and Ciarlio 0-1, 6-1. The 
perfect driving game of Novillo, cou- 
plod-up with Ilio steady 'and chop- 
stroko gamo of Koll makes their team 
one hard to boat. At times their 
team work was not up to Tech stand­
ard, but this will arrive In timo, with 
practice., Harkness and Sch.wartz 
defeated Moroledge and Monroe 0-1, 
6-1. 'I'lielr-good team work was the 
main reason,

a What Makes the Firefly Glow?
YOU can hold a firefly in your hand; you can boil 
water with an electric lamp. Nature long ago evolved 
the “cold light.” The firefly, according to Ives and 
Coblentz, radiates ninety-six percent light and only four 
percent heat. Man’s best lamp radiates more than ninety 
percent heat.
An English physicist once said that if we knew the fire­
fly’s secret, a boy turning a crank could light up a whole 
street. Great as is the advance in lighting that has been 
made through research within the last twenty years, man 
washes far too much energy in obtaining light. /
This problem of the “cold light” cannot be solved merely 
by trying to improve existing power-generating machinery 
and existing lamps. We should still be burning candles if 
chemists and physicists had confined their researches to the 
improvement of materials and methods for making candles.
For these reasons, the Research Laboratories of the 
General Electric Company are not limited in the scope of 
their investigations. Research consists in framing questions 
of the right kind and in finding the answers, no matter 
where they may lead. i„ (
What makes the firefly glow? How does a firefly’s light 
differ in color from that of an electric arc, and why? The 
answers to such questions may or may not be of. practical 
value, but of this we may be sure—it is by dovetailing the 
results of “theoretical” investigations along many widely 
separated lines that we arrive at most of our modern 
“practical” discoveries.
What will be the light of the future? Will it be like that 
of the firefly or like that of the dial on a luminous watch? 
Will it be produced irt a lamp at present undreamed of, or 
will it come from something resembling our present incan­
descent lamp? The answers to these questions will depend 
much more upon the results of research in pure science than 
upon strictly commercial research.

SCIENCE SENIOR
ALUMNAE SMOKER
Last Thursday evening the Union 
was the scene of a lively time. The 
alumnae, faculty and seniors of the 
Division of 'Sciencq and Engineering 
held a very successful smoker. The 
turn out of the alumnae was especial­
ly commendable, there being one or 
more-represnetatives of every gradu­
ating class. J. Sprague, ’19, of the 
Jones & Laughlin plant, and Bruce 
Lythe, ’IS, were the representative 
members of the first two graduating 
classes from the Science Division.
Notable among the stunts that were 
pulled off was a boxing match be­
tween Ham Whittmer, the popular 
industries football man, and Jim 
Campbell, Science, of the varsity 
boxing squad. Both men showed 
very good form and demonstrated the 
fact that they were well acquainted 
with the game. Eddie Herst, last 
year’s well-known tennis manager, j 
acted as a referee in this bout as well I 
as in a second bout between Jack | 
Barry and. Young Riche. Barry was 
at one time the amateur lightweight 
champion. He has represented Pitts­
burgh in all parts of the United 
States and some parts of Canada. 
Riche, a young rofessional in, the 
game, hails from the east side of our 
fair city of Pittsburgh. He 'is in 
training under eddie Mason and so far 
has made a very enviable record in liis 
profession.
Another of the many features of 
the affair was a five-reel thriller, a 
wild and wooly west show featuring 
Tom Mix in “The Demon Driver.”
After the picture eats were served
in the good old cafeteria style. The 
line that was formed reminded one

Air- Tight Tins of 50 
Ask your dealer to show you the new vacuum- 
sealed tins of 50 Chester­fields. A compact, con­
venient and absolutely 
AIR-TIGHT packing— 
the cigarettes keep fresh indefinitely.
TALK ABOUT being.
QUICK ON the trigger.
ONE OF our salesmen.
ONCE SAW a man.
ROLL A cigarette.
AND STOP to light it.
JUST THEN a piece.
OF FINE French pastry.
(YOU KNOW the kind.
IN THE one-arm joints.
THEY CALL ’em “sinkers.”) 
FELL ABOUT ten stories.
FROM THE lunch-box.
OF SOME „wealthy plumber. 
AND BEANED the man.
OUR SALESMAN dashed up. 
AND SAID, “Sly dear sir. 
WHAT HAPPENED?”
THE MAN rubbed his dome. 
AND BEGAN, “I was just. 
LIGHTING A cigarette.”
“GEE WHIZ,” our man said. 
“HERE—TRY mine.
THEY’LL LET you know. 
YOU’RE SMOKING.
AND THEY satisfy.
BUT THEY’LL never.
KNOCK YOU flat.”
AND THE man grinned.
AND SAID, “Son.
IF YOUR smokes.
HAVE YOUR speed.
THEY’LL SATISFY, all right.”
AND speaking of speed,1 the 
£\ fastest-growing cigarette on 
the market is this same Chester­field. :The reason? Simple enough 
—people like 'em better. That 
“can’t-be-copied blend”— that 
air-tight package—that moderate price-r-that "Satisfy” taste—no 
wonder Chesterfields are leaping 
ahead. On every count, they 
certainly do “Satisfy.’’
