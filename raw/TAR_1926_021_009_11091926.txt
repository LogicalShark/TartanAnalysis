EDITORIAL COMMENT
Birthright and stead}' evolution have com­
bined to make Carnegie an institution of 
great promise.. Old friends of this-.district- 
have been forced to follow the peculiar de­
velopment from the early, meager • days of 
Carnegie Technical Schools in 1905 to the pres- 
; cnt Carnegie Institute of Technology, a leader 
among the schools which aim at the removal 
of bungling and clumsiness from a technical 
education. In ft single institution we may 
boast of research science and college drama, 
brick bungalow construction and John Sebas- 
tion Bach, facts and values, all on. an equal 
1 curricular plane. And so, this eulogy must 
continue.
Pittsburgh, the “World's Workshop.” 
When they, broke ground for a Design school 
there musthave been a good denl-of misgiv­
ing within the. man who used’ t^hp. shovel. 
Colossal; iron, steel, electrical and mechanical 
machinery looming up pre-eminently in a com­
plete industrial independence. The magnetic 
appeal of unheard of opportunities for observ­
ing engineering: and manufacturing on a grand 
¡scaleL -All this was the glory of Pittsbnrgh,
. Carl-Sandburg’s Pittsburgh:
out, runs somewhere 
i gun, a wheel, a nail,
So fire, runs in, m 
else again,
And the bar. of steel 
a shovel,A rudder .under the sea, .a steering-gear in- the 
’.Aliy's .And always dark in the heart 'and through it,
' '«Smoki and the blood of a mail.
Smoke into steel and blood into steel • * *
The.new building went up. Within a year 
came an influx' of. artists from five distinct 
„.fields to head as many departments. Pass up 
ar dccade and what have we? A‘ symphony 
•orchestra, with the distinct smack of a pro­
fessional organization;' excellent student re­
citals. A good share of the honors and, awards 
o£ the Beaux Arts Institute of Design, of New 
York;coming to Pittsburgh. Greatest’ of all,
. perhaps, one of the finest repertory lion-com­
mercial .producers’¡theatec.in the Little Thea­
ter movement;;' A professional school; of the 
Arts. The discovery of a Pittsburgh, with 
artistic activities of interest and value, a good 
environment for art education.
All this and nothing- more. We must pause 
in our eulogy to .consider, ourselves. The scene 
is ideal—on a lovely campus science and art 
shake hands with each other—extra curricu-. 
lae has produced a much to be desired unity. 
But things are at a standstill. We sit aroupd 
waiting for. something to happen, something to 
come along which will lift' our,school up into 
the fourth dimension. Can our needsbe ex­
pressed in terms of fifty . story buildings, or 
campus improvements, or better student gov­
ernment? No; rather wc must have more. Con­
ferences on Drama, International poal Confer^ 
cnees, Walter de la Mere’s, Dr. Suzallo’s. ,Th®;. 
college can be no stronger tl>an its faculta<V 
transient and resident. This school should at­
tract the leaders of all fields, should' take steps • 
to give them chairs of distinction at Carnegie.- 
That and nothing else will be the stimulus 
which will shove this institution into a place 
of undisputed leadership. ¦ \; .„ M. T. H.
PA-MA DAY
. Within the next two weeks, or to be specific, 
ou November 20th, Carnegie will hold its an­
nual day for dads and mothers. It is import­
ant that the Campus and the school itself be 
representative. of the true Carnegie on this 
day. To many of the parents this occasion 
will represent the basin of their impression of 
the school and its functions.
In this age of criticism of-cverything which 
pertains to youth—when indeed colleges and 
college life are being condemned by many 
writers, some of whom arc of world-wide re­
pute—the least that can be done is to try .to 
make-the day a time for the correction of a 
few of the impressions that would-be sensa­
tionalists have attempted to create.
To make the occasion-a real success and to 
send the'parents of Carnegie students home 
content that their 6ons and daughters ore in 
the best of schools, it is essential that every 
student co-operate;.first, in bringing as many 
of the parents, as possible to visit the school, 
and second, that wc make the-day—their day 
—a day of welcome, one truly representative 
of that atmosphere of our college which has 
created and always maintained the Carnegie 
spirit. • •
-In connection with this subjcct it might be 
well to start some discussion with the ultimate 
end of having a new name for,Pa-Ma day. The 
'name “Pa-Ma”.originated a few years ago-to 
supplement -the old appelative, which was 
“Father’s Day” and obviously incorrect. 
However, the name “Pa-Ma” does not wear ; 
it-is .one -of thoBe words or contraction of1 
words which develops in .an emergency and is 
used for want of something better.' Although 
it covers the significance of the day, it is a bit 
crude and tendB-to grate. . Surely some name 
for an occasion such as this exists which 
would be at the same time significant and 
pleasant to > the ear as well as possessing the 
quality which makes names last: It remain;
demy claiiQB In its orthod«

.music. It hotvorily tends to relieve the inonot- 
ony .'but also has a cheering and* altogether 
restful effect on one’s mind; a thing much to 
• be. desired at the Commons.- .- It is-'our..impression that.student opinion

“THE INHERITORS”
After witnessing a perforatane >f the ’‘Inheritore" the other evei ng,. we left the Littlo Theate lllcd with admiration for th'
dislike for 'Miss Glaspell’s method 
of.', play writing. In other words, we liked Mr. Vlehman’s produc-
tho histrionic merit of a piece Xm utterly devoid, of dramatlr intercs and character development. How ever, the . cnt . did commcndabli work, considering what they hat to work with.

PROGRESS IN THE STABILIZA­TION OF .EUROPEAN CUR­RENCIES ,
Belgium has Joined tie growing list - of ' European countries that have-stabilized their currencies and re-established them òn a gold basis. -Before the; World :War the Belgian, franc was worth 19.3' cents. Because of the large Issues öt paper money which were made necessary by the demandé • of the Government for a means'of meet^ ing'their war'expenBea'the franc bad dropped In value unUU It, was worth -but a small fraction of Its former value. It was' .obviously 
Impossible to-bcins Nthe,irac‘back to its original, gold -valué àn’d-for this reason it was stabilized at a 
figure which’ makes It worth .ai^ proxlmateiy one seventh' of its orflglnal value. Formediy a dollar was worth a little more than five francs, v/hereaö at the new value the dollnr 'will exchange for thlrty-
A stabilisation loan of one hun­dred million dollars was floated In Uils country and abroad. The loan 
yielded over seven per cent Inter­est at the price at which the bonds were Bold and resulted in a quick dlBposal of these securities, ft is 
cetrtsi|i that f\he arrangements which have been made', are. suffi­cient to guarantee tbe franc against a fall. We have here the 
result of the, efforts of thé econ­omic dictatorship which was es­tablished In Belgium under the leadership of the Klng,*'and It a> pears: that. hlB work has been \6lg- 
naJly successful. ' '
The monetary systems of France and Italy have yet to be estab­lished, and their fluctuating cur- rency presents onte of'their most pressing problems. . All Indication^ are that tliey will In the' near fu­ture’follow Ute course taken by Belgium and . stabilize their cur­rencies at some figure which will not deviate greatly from the pres-
With the assembly of the French Chamb6r of Deputies this fait it Is likely that definite steps -will be - taken In the direction of tbe sta­bilization of the franc. In order to bring aboot the stabilization it will be necessary for France to float' » loan in foreign' countries 
as was done in :the case of . Belg* um. The feet that f^nnce will find It necessary to borrow funds will necessitate action in regard to the two International agreements between that country and the United States. and Great Britain.' These agreements are . concerned with the settlement' of .the long ar­gued and discussed war; debts' of France to these, two countries, and It is only too clear to all parties , concerned that - it will be neces­sary for France to n^ake.'orranBe-
