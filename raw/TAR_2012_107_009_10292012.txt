Carnegie Mellon students 
may see an increase in their 
activities fee in the near fu-
ture. On Thursday, Student 
Body Vice President for Fi-
nance Jon Mark announced 
via email that he is proposing 
a $24 increase in the semes-
terly student activities fee that 
would go into effect at the be-
ginning of the next academic 
year.
Mark, a senior lighting 
design major, will bring the 
matter up for a special elec-
tion on Nov. 8. If the student 
body votes in favor of the in-
crease, Mark will recommend 
to the Carnegie Mellon Board 
of Trustees, which sets the stu-
dent activities fee, that the fee 
be raised.
The proposed fee increase 
would affect all Carnegie Mel-
lon students, undergraduate 
and graduate. The fee would 
increase from $97 per semes-
ter to $121, a 25 percent in-
crease. However, the election 
is a split referendum, meaning 
that the votes of graduate stu-
dents and those of undergrad-
uate students are counted sep-
arately. In addition, both Mark 
and Student Body President 
Will Weiner said they intend 
to recommend raising the fee 
only for students on the Pitts-
burgh campus; until now, 
students in Qatar have always 
had to pay the same fee.
“The desire is to have the 
will of the students be repre-
sented to the Board of Trust-
ees and hope that there’s not 
a bureaucratic problem,” said 
Dean of Student Affairs Gina 
Casalegno. “Does it create 
some technology problems 
in terms of from a systems 
standpoint and implementa-
tion from the registrar’s of-
?ce, etc.? Certainly it’s easier

Carnegie Mellon students 
voting on campus Nov. 6 will 
have the opportunity to cast 
their ballots in two local po-
litical races: one for a House 
of Representatives member 
and one for a Pennsylvania 
Senate seat.
The following breakdowns 
are intended to provide a ba-
sic outline for the two main 
candidates running for these 
positions so students voting 
will be able to make an in-
formed decision. 
The incumbent candidates 
and their challengers are de-
scribed below, with an out-
line of their basic experience, 
campaign focus, and stances 
on key issues.
House
Students will be able to 
vote for the representative 
for Pennsylvania’s 14th dis-
trict. The two challengers vy-
ing for a spot in the House of 
Representatives this year are 
incumbent Democrat Mike 
Doyle and Republican Hans 
Lessmann.
A ninth-term congress-
man, Doyle is a graduate of 
Pennsylvania State University 
with a bachelor’s in commu-
nity development. Doyle pre-
viously served as the Chief of 
Staff for state Senator Frank 
Pecora.
Doyle’s campaign is 
framed around high-tech de-
velopment for the Western 
Pennsylvania region.
According to Doyle’s web-
site, “Congressman Doyle has 
been working aggressively on 
the Energy and Commerce 
Committee to reduce U.S. 
dependence on foreign oil 
supplies through the devel-
opment of new, more ener-
gy-ef?cient technology and 
alternative and renewable 
sources of energy. He is also 
actively involved in efforts to 
draft energy policies that will 
halt global warming without 
destroying or outsourcing 
American jobs.”
Doyle currently serves on 
the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee, and is a 
member of the subcommit-
tee on Communications and 
Technology, as well as the 
Energy and Power subcom-
mittee.
Doyle has a voting record 
against the Iraq war, is con-
sistent with pro-choice views, 
and is in support of President 
Barack Obama’s economic 
stimulus efforts.
Challenger Lessmann’s 
campaign is focused on job 
creation in Western Penn-
sylvania, and promises to 
achieve this through a de-
crease in taxation and govern-
ment interference in business 
operations.
Lessmann’s website opens 
with the declaration, “The 
people deserve competition,” 
and states, “The ‘Steel City’ 
has been left behind under 
the uncontested rein of Mike 
Doyle. While the rest of the 
country has grown, we have 
stagnated or declined. As the 
most livable city, we have 
much untapped potential, yet 
Mike Doyle’s leadership has 
failed. We should be attract-
ing people, tourism, nonprof-
its, research, businesses, and 
corporations. Our children 
should not leave home for 
jobs.”

Students gathered for 
a student panel discussion 
to address diversity within 
the ?elds of science, tech-
nology, engineering, and 
math  (STEM) as part of “A 
Celebration of Diversity in 
STEM” last Wednesday.
The panel was held in 
the Gates Hillman Complex 
and was hosted by organi-
zations including Women@
SCS, the Society of Women 
Engineers, the National 
Society of Black Engineers, 
and the Society of Hispanic 
Professional Engineers.
Panelists responded to 
questions from the audi-
ence about their experi-
ences as minorities in their 
respective STEM ?elds. 
The panel featured four 
Carnegie Mellon students: 
Ph.D. candidate in chemical 
engineering Sharon M. Vu-
ong, Ph.D. candidate in hu-
man-computer interaction 
Tawanna Dillahunt, senior 
computer science and math 
double major Adrian Trejo 
Nuñez, and Ph.D. candidate 
in information systems Ed-
ward McFowland III.
Because the speakers 
were involved in outreach 
programs intended to give 
young minority students 
more opportunities, the 
panelists focused on the 
power of education on mi-
norities.
McFowland volunteers 
for a program called Pitts-
burgh Science and Technol-
ogy, which allows middle  
and high school students to 
participate in lessons in sci-
ence and technology ?elds.
“I think young black men 
face a lot of challenges....
The problems that resonate 
with me are the problems 
of young black men, and I 
think that, unfortunately, 
educated black men are an 
endangered species,” he 
said. “I want to be an ex-
ample, as well as provide a 
haven for exploring these 
things.”
Vuong talked about her 
experience teaching at the 
Carnegie Mellon Institute 
for Talented Elementary 
and Secondary Students, C-
MITES. She elaborated on 
the stereotypes that pres-
sure young girls into avoid-
ing engineering.
“There’s a slight stigma 
to being really girly, and 
some of them like being 
girly, and don’t really iden-
tify with engineering at all,” 
she said.
Vuong cited her own ex-
perience; when she applied 
to college, she originally 
intended to study profes-
sional ballet, but ultimately 
chose to become a chemical 
engineer.
All of the panelists ad-
mitted to noticing a lack of 
minority teachers and pro-
fessors throughout their 
high school and college ca-
reers.
Dillahunt said that “hav-
ing a minority professor by 
itself encourages students 
to stay in school.”
Trejo Nuñez said, “For 
kids growing up that makes 
a difference too; they think 
‘well, maybe I can’t be an 
educator,’ even though 
they’d be good at it, but see-
ing someone in that role, 
that could change it.” As a

Writer Melinda Hemmel-
garn gave a talk at Carnegie 
Mellon on Wednesday as part 
of Campus Sustainability and 
Food Day. The talk focused 
on the choices that consum-
ers make with regards to 
their food.
Carmegie Mellon’s Cam-
pus Sustainability and Food 
Day celebrated “sustainabili-
ty and the movement towards 
‘more healthy, affordable and 
sustainable food,’ ” according 
to a university press release.
Hemmelgarn’s talk was 
the main event of Food Day. 
According to Hemmelgarn, 
consumers should not only 
think of the ?nal form of the 
food they eat, but also where 
it came from, how it was 
made, and at what cost it was 
produced.
Sarah Kuethe, sophomore 
political science and sociol-
ogy double major at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, said the 
talk related to students since 
they have unique food con-
cerns. 
“As students, we don’t 
have many choices with 
food,” Kuethe said.
Hemmelgarn addressed 
several aspects of food con-
sumption, production, and 
marketing: water, chemicals, 
label lingo, autism, environ-
ment, policy, food safety, 
farmers, and healthcare. One 
of the main lessons of her talk 
was what makes food “good.”

Carnegie Mellon’s depart-
ment of electrical and com-
puter engineering has part-
nered with the University of 
Porto’s business school to of-
fer a new dual-degree gradu-
ate program in business and 
engineering.
The program spans two 
years, allowing participating 
students to study for one year 
at the University of Porto in 
Porto, Portugal and one year 
at Carnegie Mellon. Students 
in the program will graduate 
with a master of science in 
electrical and computer engi-
neering and a master of busi-
ness administration.
Ed Schlesinger, Carnegie 
Mellon’s electrical and com-
puter engineering depart-
ment head, said in a universi-
ty press release, “We have our 
?rst students enrolled in the 
new program, and we expect 
the initiative to grow as more 
companies globally seek the 
problem-solving, manage-
rial, and technical skills ac-
quired through engineering 
and business studies provid-
ed by this double M.S./MBA 
experience.” 
“This new program builds 
on the long-standing rela-
tionship developed with the 
successful [Information and 
Communication Technology 
Institute], in which Carnegie 
Mellon has partnered with 
a number of leading Portu-
guese universities,” he said.

Krzysztof Matyjaszewski,  
a Carnegie Mellon natural 
sciences professor, and Chris-
topher Bettinger, a materi-
als science and engineering 
and biomedical engineering 
professor, have received a 
$1.6 million grant from the 
U.S. Army to research pros-
thetics. The researchers are 
working with robotic limbs 
that respond to signals from 
patients’ brains. They hope 
to develop materials that re-
spond better and last longer.
“The tissue constructs 
are designed to make stable, 
long-term connections be-
tween nerves in the peripher-
al nervous system by mimick-
ing the native tissue areas,” 
Bettinger said in a university 
press release.
“New techniques in poly-
mer chemistry have allowed 
us to make smarter, more du-
rable materials. We have been 
able to create materials with 
great potential in a variety of 
applications. It’s exciting to 
see if we can make something 
that will help those who wear 
prostheses,” said Matyjasze-
wski in the press release.
Bettinger and Matyjasze-
wski hope that their work 
will help American soldiers 
returning from war with am-
putated limbs.
Bettinger added in the 
press release, “It is impera-
tive that we develop pioneer-
ing tools and devices to better 
help our wounded warriors 
recover from such traumatic 
injuries.”

Hurricane Sandy, a Category 1 hurricane that started last Monday in the Caribbean Sea, has made landfall on the East Coast of the U.S., merging 
with a cold front to become what the media has dubbed “Frankenstorm.” Sandy is expected to continue inland, and Pittsburgh falls within the pos-
sible range of its epicenter. Pittsburgh can expect to see Sandy on Tuesday.
Statistically Speaking
East Coast residents have been worried by the pos-
sibility of widespread damage from Hurricane Sandy, 
which hit the coast on Sunday. Sandy’s projected path 
puts the storm right over Pittsburgh on Tuesday. Here 
are some facts about other storms that have hit the area:

Lessmann graduated from 
Purdue University and the 
Pennsylvania College of Op-
tometry, and recently aligned 
himself with the Tea Party by 
speaking at Western Pennsyl-
vania Tea Party events.
Lessmann said in an article 
in The Wall Street Journal that 
the recent health care act is 
“offensive and disrespectful 
to the Constitution.” 
Senate
This year’s U.S. Senate 
race in Pennsylvania is be-
tween incumbent Democrat 
Bob Casey, Jr. and Republican 
Tom Smith.
Casey, who defeated in-
cumbent Republican Sena-
tor Rick Santorum in 2006, 
attended the College of the 
Holy Cross and received a law 
degree from the Columbus 
School of Law at the Catholic 
University of America. Casey 
is running on an economic 
platform. “To spur growth in 
Pennsylvania’s life sciences 
industry, Senator Casey intro-
duced the Life Sciences Jobs 
and Investment Act to pro-
mote innovation and job cre-
ation in life sciences research 
and development,” according 
to his website.
Casey supported Obama’s 
health care act and voted for 
the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell.” He is in favor of nondis-
crimination legislation for the 
LGBT community.
Casey was a co-sponsor of 
the Stop Online Piracy Act, 
which drew substantial criti-
cism due to accusations of it 
giving the government power 
for internet censorship.
His opponent this fall is 
Republican Tom Smith, who 
plans to simplify the tax code 
by instituting a ?at tax and 
closing loopholes. He also 
wants to reduce annual fed-
eral spending to 20 percent of 
the gross domestic product.
He campaigned to end the 
regulation that he says “suf-
focates growth and kills jobs,” 
according to his website.
Smith, who postponed col-
lege to run his family farm, 
worked in the coal industry 
in Pennsylvania, and wants to 
bring his business experience 
in a highly regulated industry 
into the political arena.
Smith’s effective advertis-
ing gained him a great deal of 
attention, especially the ad-
vertisements that cast Casey 
as “Candidate Zero,” altering 
the Obama campaign’s “O” 
logo to be a zero.
Despite these two races be-
ing dominated by candidates 
from the country’s main par-
ties, students willing to be in-
terviewed about their voting 
plans all expressed displea-
sure with the limited choice in 
mainstream candidates.
Sophomore mathematics 
major Arun Ramakrishnan 
said, “Personally, I don’t re-
ally support either of the can-
didates. If I did vote I would 
vote independent, but that 
wouldn’t count.”
Andrew Schwartz, a soph-
omore information systems 
major, is also frustrated by 
the inability of independent 
candidates to win elections. 
“I am voting, but not for a ma-
jor party candidate,” he said. 
“I hope that the candidate 
that loses does so by a margin 
equal to the population that 
didn’t vote for a major party 
candidate, so the party real-
izes that their views were too 
extreme.”
Stanley Krasner, sopho-
more economics and math-
ematics major, will not vote. 
“In my current situation as 
an economics student, I feel 
that my vote in this election 
will not be as educated now as 
it will four years from now,” 
he said. “I feel that I should 
gain more knowledge before 
voting for something as im-
portant as our nation’s next 
leader.”
safe, produced humanely, 
accessible to all, safe from 
chemicals, seasonal, and re-
gional.
“Food has to be safe and it 
has to taste good. Who wants 
to eat if it doesn’t taste good?” 
Hemmelgarn said. “It has to 
be produced humanely, and 
that means from the animals 
all the way up to the people.” 
She said the workers who 
plant and pick food need to 
be treated well. If they are 
treated poorly, then the food 
is “not good food.”
In her talk, Hemmelgarn 
also explained the difference 
between organic and natural 
food. 
She warned the audience 
to “be careful of the lingo” on 
packages.
“Organic is extremely dif-
ferent from natural,” Hem-
melgarn said. “Organic has a 
strong federal regulation in 
terms on what it can be and 
what it can’t be. Natural? 
Very weak. No legal de?ni-
tions, really; the FDA has one 
food de?nition, the [U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture] has 
another.”
During her talk, Hem-
melgarn said that consumers 
should wait to buy organic 
foods until they’re in season 
locally.
“Good food is seasonal 
and regional when it can be,” 
Hemmelgarn said. “There’s 
something better about a 
strawberry that you waited 
for. We can always get straw-
berries in February. They’re 
everywhere. But is that sus-
tainable? And I would argue 
that they’re not as delicious.”
Later, Hemmelgarn con-
tinued, “The gold standard is 
local, organic. The problem 
is that we import a lot. So 
[consider] an organic pepper 
that’s [not] sprayed, but it’s 
coming from the Dominican 
Republic. It’s good that there 
are no harmful chemicals be-
ing used in the Dominican Re-
public, but we have to consid-
er the fuel that’s used to bring 
this pepper here. So maybe 
just wait another month or 
two, and then you’ll have pep-
pers that are local.”
When asked about how 
that could potentially nega-
tively affect the economics of 
the country exporting food 
for money, Hemmelgarn said, 
“I think it’s important for 
countries to be food secure 
and to be able to feed them-
selves.”
Jessica Owens, the su-
pervisor of supplemental in-
struction in Excel programs 
at Carnegie Mellon, said that 
she thought the talk “aligned 
with a lot of initiatives” at the 
university. 
Owens said she would take 
away Hemmelgarn’s “encour-
agement to do more critical 
thinking” about food and ap-
ply it to life.
“I think it’s important to 
be a part of the food system,” 
said London Depaule, a grad-
uate student at Chatham Uni-
versity. Depaule worked for a 
nonpro?t where he encoun-
tered people who didn’t have 
easy access to food. 
“I don’t think you’ll know 
what it’s like unless you live 
in that situation,” Depaule 
said. Of the talk, he said that 
he thought it was “a call to ac-
tion” for students.
“We have to rethink food 
access, and I’d like to ask the 
question: Why can’t people 
get to good food?” Hemmel-
garn said. “I don’t care wheth-
er you’re in a prison, or a day 
care, a school, or where you 
are in the class system.... Ev-
eryone deserves good food.”
“I think it’s so important to 
eat organically and recognize 
that, while cheap is good, it’s 
bad in the long run,” Suvi 
Gluskin, a senior in the Bach-
elor of Humanities and Arts 
program said. “I hope CMU 
incorporates more organic 
sustainable practices.”

Nuñez plans to return to his 
hometown to encourage stu-
dents to pursue STEM ?elds.
Carol Frieze, the organizer 
of the event and director of 
Women@SCS, said that the 
number of women involved 
in engineering and computer 
science has decreased in re-
cent years. Frieze emphasized 
the importance of having a di-
verse student body, especially 
in STEM. “The President [of 
the U.S.] says diversity makes 
university and education 
healthier for everybody,” she 
said.
Jose Morales, a researcher 
from the Software Engineer-
ing Institute who helped or-
ganize the event, said, “Just 
because you’re diverse, it 
doesn’t make you different in 
a weird way. You should ac-
tually celebrate who you are, 
your background, take pride 
of it, and blend it into your 
academic life.”
Frieze and Morales said 
that the event was a trial run 
for future events, intended to 
gauge turnout and interest. 
Morales said that this panel 
will emulate future events at a 
bigger level.
Frieze closed the celebra-
tion by emphasizing the im-
portance of promoting diver-
sity in STEM ?elds. “These 
are ?elds that, you know, 
have very few minorities. And 
that’s why we’re paying atten-
tion,” she said.
if everyone gets to assess the 
fee and gets exactly the same. 
Easier, absolutely. But we can 
handle that difference.”
Mark campaigned last se-
mester on a platform of raising 
the fee. He wrote in his of?cial 
platform, “The student activi-
ties fee should be increased 
to re?ect the growing need 
of student organizations.... 
Through good advertising and 
education, I am con?dent the 
student body will see value in 
the increase for this fee.”
The student activities fee 
is distributed annually by the 
Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC) to recognized student 
organizations.
Mark, who sits at the head 
of the JFC, believes that a fee 
increase is necessary in order 
to counteract a growing dis-
parity between the funds re-
quested by student organiza-
tions and funds granted — in 
particular, Mark said, between 
the revenue that JFC expects 
organizations to raise for 
themselves, and the amount 
that organizations are actually 
able to raise.
“We really started seeing 
that revenue expectations 
were really high,” Mark said.
Weiner, a senior economics 
and statistics and decision sci-
ence double major, said that 
he has been a proponent of 
raising the fee since his time as 
Undergraduate Student Sen-
ate chair.
“It’s an issue I think that is 
pretty important to students, 
and I wanted to make sure 
... to give the students an op-
portunity to actually vote and 
see if this issue that we see as 
a problem [is one] students 
agree with,” Weiner said.
According to Weiner, stu-
dent government has been 
looking into other ways of 
solving the funding problem, 
such as tightening the require-
ments for funding student 
groups. But Weiner feels that 
raising the student activities 
fee is the only viable long-term 
solution.
“A part of the big problem 
is that groups have been cut-
ting back on lots of things,” 
he said. “Spring break trips 
aren’t being funded at all right 
now. These were things that 
we couldn’t think of a way to 
fund at all. The only real solu-
tion to it is more money, at this 
point.”
Mark, in turn, stressed the 
qualitative effect a fee increase 
would have on groups. “I meet 
with probably close to seven 
organizations a week. And just 
hearing about how they don’t 
have enough and how the 
system doesn’t work for them 
in certain ways, that’s what 
drives me to know that I need 
to overhaul this process.”
Students in funded organi-
zations have been guardedly 
positive about the idea of an 
increase.Ivy Krislov, a junior 
technical writing and creative 
writing double major and head 
of ?nance for readme, said, 
“We’re only getting money to 
put out the minimum number 
of issues that we would nor-
mally put out. We have very 
limited funds for anything 
else, and we’re expanding this 
year, so we have been mincing 
around trying to ?nd money to 
do things.”
“Our student activities fee 
isn’t that expensive this year, 
so [a raise] would probably be 
worth it, just so that we could 
expand the opportunities peo-
ple can offer to students,” Kris-
lov added.
Timothy Bach, a senior 
computer science major and 
operations director for Carn-
egie Mellon EMS, believes our 
current student activities fee is 
fairly low, and that in order for 
our school to focus on provid-
ing a well-rounded education, 
it should place emphasis on 
supporting student activities.
“If we are intelligent about 
how we spend our JFC money, 
I think raising that fee will al-
low our students to do better 
things: to go to more confer-
ences, to travel more, to learn 
more, to broaden their hori-
zons, and I think that is criti-
cal,” Bach said. “I, like many 
other students, obviously do 
not want to pay more money, 
but I think that this is one of 
the areas where it is worth it.”
However, Bach said that be-
cause he categorizes Carnegie 
Mellon EMS as a campus ser-
vice, he does not believe that 
all of the club’s funding should 
be derived from Student Ac-
tivities. “Because we’re a cam-
pus service, we get the major-
ity of our money from campus 
affairs. We get money from 
JFC and SDC to cover gaps 
in our budget for things like 
upgrading our infrastructure 
and buying required things 
like uniforms. I think that the 
purpose of JFC is to encourage 
students to do things outside 
of class,” he said.
Tetyana Dolotova, H&SS 
interdisciplinary senior and 
president of Ballroom Dance 
Club, said that she would sup-
port an increase in the student 
activities fee if the change was 
minimal. “I would not want 
to run our club as an incon-
venience to the student body, 
but if it’s a subtle increase that 
other students won’t really 
notice, then I would [support 
it],” Dolotova said.
With the extra funding, 
Dolotova said her club would 
use the money to get Activi-
ties Board lighting and host 
bigger events. “We hire profes-
sional dance instructors, and 
they charge a high fee for their 
services, and we also have a 
competition team — we have 
to pay to have them attend 
competitions,” she said.
Shilpa Balaji, a senior 
computer science major and 
president of Mock Trial, said, 
“The thing with the student 
activities fee is that a lot of 
that money goes to clubs that 
the people providing that fee 
aren’t necessarily a part of. 
Do I really want to be giving 
money to organizations that I 
will never see a bene?t from 
— or to a cause that I don’t 
necessarily support? I think it 
could be good, but any kind of 
extremely large raise, I might 
have issues with.”
The special election will 
run from Nov. 8 to Nov. 10. 
Mark will hold two town hall 
meetings to discuss the fee: 
one this Wednesday at 5 p.m. 
in Rangos 1, and one on Nov. 
6 at 5 p.m. in the Danforth 
Lounge.

CMU and Disney researchers create 3-D printed optics
JENNIFER GOLDA
Staffwriter
With the development of 
novel 3-D printed optics, magic 
comes to life at Carnegie Mel-
lon inside the Disney Research 
Pittsburgh lab. 
Behind the closed doors 
of the Robert Mehrabian Col-
laborative Innovation Center, 
members of the Disney and 
Carnegie Mellon communi-
ties are conducting various 
projects and creating innova-
tive technologies that would 
enhance the entertainment 
experience of Disney’s amuse-
ment parks.
Three-dimensional print-
ing is a manufacturing process 
in which an object is created, 
or “printed,” one layer at a 
time. Using a printing liquid 
that cures quickly, the printer 
creates the object pass-by-pass 
per the desired geometry pro-
vided by a computer program. 
Even though 3-D printers 
were introduced in the ’80s, 
new technologies and reduced 
costs have allowed research to 
expand.
For example, multiple ma-
terials can be printed into one 
object. This property broadens 
the range of 3-D printing’s ap-
plications by increasing the 
level of complexity a printed 
structure can have.
The Disney Research web-
site describes printed optics 
as, “A new approach to creat-
ing custom optical elements 
for interactive devices using 
3-D printing.” Optics refers to 
the behavior and properties of 
light, and manipulating light 
is important to an entertain-
ment company such as Disney. 
The uses  range from the expe-
rience someone gets walking 
through a room to an interac-
tive digital display.
On the team researching 
printed optics are Karl D.D. 
Willis, a Ph.D. candidate in 
computational design; adjunct 
professor of architecture Eric 
Brockmeyer; Human-Comput-
er Interaction Institute profes-
sor Scott E. Hudson; and Ivan 
Poupyrev, a Disney senior re-
search scientist.
The researchers’ optical el-
ements are printed from trans-
parent plastic, and they use 
bubbles to manipulate light. 
Bubbles added inside the plas-
tic during printing re?ect light 
within the display to reveal in-
ternal patterns or text.
To direct light, the group 
developed light pipes, which 
resemble optical ?bers. Be-
cause multiple materials al-
low one to create structures 
within structures, light pipes 
made from transparent plas-
tics can be printed within the 
greater structure, and they of-
fer a wider range in lighting 
displays than optical ?ber can.
When describing the ver-
satility 3-D printing has to of-
fer, Willis said, “There’s really 
no other technology that...
can make clear material that 
is arbitrary geometry and ar-
bitrary shapes on the inside.”
The team used a toy with 
light-up and moving eyes as 
an example of this technol-
ogy’s applications. By redirect-
ing images projected in the 
toy’s base through its body, 
the team has created a light 
display in a children’s toy 
without LEDs, batteries, or cir-
cuits. This simplicity highlights 
another advantage of 3-D 
printing: Everything is printed 
in one piece, not made up of 
multiple parts.
A printed structure is still 
currently more expensive to 
produce than a similar product 
assembled from pieces. The 
researchers, however, stressed 
that the goal of this research 
is not about mass production, 
but about customization.
“We’re really not trying to 
compete with [commercial] 
technologies,” Brockmeyer 
said, “But sort of trying to 
realize what additive manu-
facturing can provide that is 
different from those manufac-
turing.”
In addition to manipulat-
ing the properties of light, 
their research involves utiliz-
ing light to give toys differ-
ent capabilities. If pieces are 
inserted into the object mid-
print, like an LED or infrared 
emitter/receiver pairs, the ob-
ject can detect light in addition 
to refracting it. This ability al-
lows the technology to expand 
to sensors.
The possibilities are far and 
wide — with its versatile and 
customizable nature, this tech-
nology surpasses traditional 
optics and is limited only by 
one’s imagination. Printed 
optics would make any geek 
agree with Disney: “Dreams 
do come true.”

How does an iPhone 
know when a ?nger touches 
its screen? It’s because the 
screen is capacitive, meaning 
that it has a little bit of electric 
current resting on its surface. 
When someone touches it, a 
tiny amount of current ?ows 
through that person’s body to 
the Earth, which makes the 
voltage on the screen surface 
drop. The iPhone observes 
this difference in voltage and 
realizes that a human must be 
touching it.
Chris Harrison, a Ph.D. 
student in the Human-Com-
puter Interaction Institute, has 
re?ned this technology in his 
research. He and his collabo-
rators — Ivan Poupyrev of 
Disney Research and Mune-
hiko Sato of the University of 
Tokyo — created a prototype 
of a capacitive sensor that 
can tell who is touching the 
screen. While normal capaci-
tive screens might measure 
the draw of electricity at 
1,000 Hz, this prototype mea-
sures the draw at many dif-
ferent frequencies — ranging 
from 1,000 to 3.5 million Hz. 
This creates a curve in real 
time representing the electri-
cal properties of the person 
touching the screen.
The construction of the 
original capacitive sensor 
took two years to fully devel-
op, followed by six months of 
research on person differenti-
ation. The researchers tested 
their sensor on a group of 12 
participants.
The researchers’ sensor 
samples the electrical proper-
ties of a human; these prop-
erties are in?uenced by “how 
dense your bones are, how 
much blood you have, how 
muscular you are, what kind 
of shoes you’re wearing,” 
Harrison said. After measur-
ing these characteristics and 
learning from them, the sen-
sor can use that to guess who 
the person is. Their research 
leverages the fact that electri-
cal properties differ from per-
son to person, but also from 
tissue to tissue.
“Your bones might have 
the lowest resistance at 
12,000 Hz, but if you go to 
15,000, there is higher resis-
tance,” Harrison said.
For example, if you have 
a two-player game on a big 
touch screen, one player 
would draw in blue and the 
other would draw in red. 
The system would know who 
drew in what color without 
prior knowledge of the play-
ers and without them needing 
to identify themselves before 
each move. Undoing a move 
would also become easier. 
When a player clicks the undo 
button, his last move would 
be erased — not the global 
last move, which might be-
long to the other player.
Knowing who is touching 
the screen and when is a use-
ful feature, especially for big 
surfaces. In the case of games 
that are on the same screen, 
capacitive sensing can keep 
individual score.
However, the system has 
not yet been perfected. A user 
could fool the system by try-
ing to copy the curve repre-
senting the electrical proper-
ties of another person. “If you 
lift your foot off the ground 
and you touch something 
made of metal, you can trick 
the system so that your curve 
looks very similar to mine,” 
Harrison said.
When wearing thick boots, 
a user is going to look differ-
ent than a user wearing light 
sneakers. While this is not 
good for security, the system 
looks for differentiation when 
two people come together to 
play a game on a tablet.
“You look different from 
me just enough that it would 
work for an hour,” Harrison 
said.
But sensing in the real 
world is more probabilistic 
than binary. Harrison believes 
he can combine his capacitive 
sensing method with comput-
er vision, speech processing, 
and motion detection in order 
to get better accuracy. Any 
single sensing method might 
be 90 percent accurate, but 
when combined, they could 
be as accurate as 99 percent. 
This is the challenge for 
Harrison’s future research: 
making the system more ro-
bust, out of the lab and into 
the real world in phones and 
tablets. For this, more users 
and test cases are needed to 
completely understand how it 
performs. The user study the 
researchers conducted was 
not big, but it showed that the 
technology can work. “And 
that’s already a big contribu-
tion,” Harrison said.

One often hears of lie 
detectors being used to de-
termine whether a suspect 
is providing an accurate ac-
count. The most people know 
is that the suspect is asked 
a series of questions and, by 
the end, the examiner studies 
the machine’s results and hy-
pothesizes whether or not the 
answers were accurate. But 
what are the true mechanics 
of this machine?
Although it is a seem-
ingly complex process for a 
machine to assess a complex 
array of human emotion and 
cognition based on a few re-
sponses, the mechanisms of 
a lie detector are relatively 
simple.
Lie detectors, also known 
as polygraphs, are most com-
monly used for criminal inves-
tigations or government-re-
lated job positions. The idea is 
to determine signs of lying by 
assessing the suspect’s physi-
ological responses to a series 
of questions.
The examiner chooses 
from a variety of techniques 
to determine if the sub-
ject’s physiological reactions 
changed signi?cantly or devi-
ated from normal levels dur-
ing the period of the test. The 
most common method exam-
iners use is to ask suspects 
a series of multiple-choice 
questions, some of which only 
the criminal would know the 
answer to. During and after 
the test, examiners determine 
whether the suspect’s reac-
tions changed signi?cantly 
when asked these targeted 
questions.
Another method common-
ly used by examiners is assess-
ing the suspect’s physiological 
reaction to a few simple, neu-
tral questions at the begin-
ning of the exam, and seeing 
whether their reactions to 
sensitive questions differ sig-
ni?cantly. Similarly, examin-
ers may ask the suspects to lie 
deliberately, so that the way 
they react may be compared 
to their reactions to questions 
asked later in the exam.
The last approach examin-
ers use is alternating between 
asking the subject neutral as 
well as sensitive questions, 
assessing the ?uctuation be-
tween their reactions.
To monitor physical reac-
tions, sensors are attached 
to people taking the test to 
monitor their breathing rate, 
pulse, blood pressure, per-
spiration, and occasionally 
limb movements. Subjects’ 
reactions are recorded by the 
sensors and then graphed 
by needles on moving paper. 
In more modern versions of 
polygraphs, the same goal is 
achieved by advanced com-
puter algorithms, which mon-
itor these signs and then send 
the results to be graphed onto 
a digital screen.
While polygraphs are cur-
rently the most accessible 
means of determining wheth-
er or not a suspect is being 
truthful, the machine does 
have its drawbacks. It is im-
portant to recall that technol-
ogy is deterministic — that is, 
it produces a certain result by 
going through a known series 
of steps. 
Therefore, if a suspect is 
in fact a criminal and knows 
the workings of a lie detec-
tor, he or she can manipulate 
it so that it displays data to 
make answers seem truthful. 
Since increased sweat is of-
ten detected by the machine 
as an indicator of lying, one 
can use a strong antiperspi-
rant to keep from sweating 
too much. One can also take 
a drug that lessens symptoms 
of stress, such as Valium, in 
order to give more measured 
responses. 
On the other hand, blood 
pressure medication can have 
adverse affects on the poly-
graph test. If the person tak-
ing the test takes this type of 
medication, the results could 
show a number of lies, even if 
he or she was telling the truth. 
Errors may also be made on 
an examiner’s end, because 
human emotions are, after all, 
unpredictable and may not be 
accurately portrayed by tech-
nology. 
Polygraphs are utilized in 
criminal thefts, national se-
curity matters, and even pre-
employment screenings. So if 
you ever ?nd yourself being 
tested by one, remember to 
stay calm, breathe, and an-
swer honestly — whether it’s 
for your job or your alibi.

new “State of the Air” app, 
available for both iPhone and 
Android, which also connects 
to Twitter and Facebook. This 
app informs residents of the 
air quality in their living area 
for following days, as well as 
of the danger of the air pollu-
tion and ozone levels that oc-
cupy nearby areas.
It depicts a character with

Neurobiologist studies singing mice
Scientists discovered that 
mice can sing, similar to dol-
phins and songbirds. Enrich 
Jarvis, a neurobiologist at 
Duke University, stated that 
mice have more similarities 
with humans in vocal com-
munication than with any 
other species. Jarvis veri?ed 
that mice did not have brain 
connections to pick up new 
songs by conducting experi-
ments that involved destroy-
ing mice’s motor controls.
In the future, Jarvis plans 
to study how genes affect vo-
calization in mice and brain 
structure to determine its 
similarities of that to humans 
and songbirds. Jarvis’ ulti-
mate question lies in whether 
mice can sing better than 
songbirds can.

Scientists one-up nature with synthetic solar cell
Researchers, led by Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy professor Daniel Nocera, 
have produced an advanced 
solar cell in the shape of a leaf 
that is 10 times more ef?cient 
at carrying out photosynthe-
sis than a natural cell is. The 
cell has catalytic materials 
on both sides, and needs no 
external wires or control cir-
cuits.
When placed in a contain-
er of water under sunlight, 
the cell produces oxygen bub-
bles from one side and hydro-
gen bubbles from the other. 
Both of these are collected to 
produce energy if the cell is 
placed in a container that sep-
arates the two sides. The cell 
itself is composed of widely 
available materials such as 
silicon, cobalt, and nickel.

Dinosaurs may have used feathers for mating
Paleontologists looking at 
Canadian dinosaur fossils dis-
covered in 1995 believe that 
the juvenile ornithomimus 
had feathers.
The dinosaur still did not 
have the ability to ?y, and the 
exact purpose of the feath-
ers remains unknown. As the 
feathers are only found on 
adults, some scientists specu-
late they may have been used 
for reproductive purposes. 
“The idea is that these were 
for communication,” said bird 
expert Richard Prum of Yale 
University. The new ?ndings 
were published in the journal

Ozone hole smallest size in decades
Scientists have determined 
that the hole in the ozone lay-
er reached its smallest maxi-
mum extent in two decades. 
The ozone layer, which pro-
tects the Earth from UV light, 
thins during late September 
and early October; this year’s 
largest reported hole was 21.2 
million square kilometers. 
The hole in the ozone layer 
is created by frigid tempera-
tures and reactions between 
chlorine and man-made chlo-
ro?uorocarbon gases. Scien-
tists say that the shrinking of 
the hole can be attributed to 
warmer Antarctic tempera-
tures from changing weather.

Newly discovered species of frog appears to lie
Conservation Internation-
al announced the discovery 
of a new species of frog, nick-
named the “Pinocchio frog,” 
in the Foja Mountains of New 
Guinea. This lost-world am-
phibian was found by Paul 
Oliver, a herpetologist at 
the University of Adelaide, 
who happened to spot one 
perched on a bag of rice at 
the campsite during a down-
pour. 
The Pinocchio frog’s  nose 
is noted to stand up when 
the frog is excited, and droop 
down otherwise. Other func-
tions of the Pinocchio frog’s 
nose remain unknown.

Student government has an im-
age problem, but this year’s Student 
Senate Week faced the issues head 
on.
The editorial board of The Tartan 
has not been shy in the past about 
noting the lack of transparency be-
tween the student body and Student 
Senate. Although Senate representa-
tives are very aware of the concerns 
and priorities of the student body (as 
students themselves), there is often 
a lack of visibility with Student Sen-
ate’s activities.
Last year, we were very excited 
to hear the announcement of Carn-
egie Mellon’s ?rst ever Student Sen-
ate Week, a ?ve-day-long series of 
events aimed at improving transpar-
ency. But we were disappointed to 
?nd that 2011’s Senate Week focused 
more on Senators’ awareness of the 
student body than vice versa. 
However, it seems that this year, 
Student Senate is aiming to form a 
stronger relationship with the stu-
dent body and create a means to 
disperse information to the campus 
community. We were very impressed 
with how this year’s Student Senate 
went above and beyond and focused 
Senate Week toward improving the 
student body’s awareness of Student 
Senate. 
The presence of representatives 
tabling outside of the University 
Center was a notable change from 
previous years, where student gov-
ernment lacked an ongoing and im-
mediate connection with students on 
campus.
In particular, The Tartan would 
like to commend the college repre-
sentatives who, in conjunction with 
Senate Week, sent out emails last 
Monday to just their respective de-
partments’ students. The emails con-
tained the names of the representa-
tives, in order to encourage student 
body input on Senate initiatives. 
Not only is this a tactful acknowl-
edgement and a step in the right di-
rection toward improving their vis-
ibility, but this type of outreach to 
departments from Student Senators 
— as individuals with names rather 
than as an amorphous student orga-
nization — is incredibly useful for 
the student body. 
We strongly encourage the rest 
of Student Senate to perform similar 
types of student body outreach in the 
future.
Student Senate improves visibility with Senate Week
Activities fee increase based on improper metrics
Student Body President for Fi-
nance Jon Mark, along with student 
government’s Executive Branch, is 
petitioning to raise the student ac-
tivities fee by 25 percent, or $24 per 
semester. 
This is a well-meaning cause in 
theory — student organizations 
would greatly bene?t from more 
money. Organizations have been hit 
hard with cutbacks in their budgets, 
and the reported $272,000 extra rev-
enue from a fee increase would do 
wonders for student groups. 
However, the intention is where 
the good part of this proposed in-
crease stops. The reasoning and 
statistics Mark cites in the various 
documents he emailed to students 
on Thursday are vague at best. 
For example, Mark ties the stu-
dent activities fee to the the Con-
sumer Price Index (CPI) and argues 
that the CPI has increased by an av-
erage of 2.4 percent per year, while 
the number of student organizations 
has increased by about 10 percent. 
Mark claims that this is one of 
the main reasons for cutbacks and 
why groups are forced to do more 
with less. However, the CPI is used to 
calculate in?ation in the economy: 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics deter-
mines the average cost for a bundle 
of household purchases, and the re-
sulting CPI represents the changes 
in the prices of these average pur-
chases.
The purpose of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s activities fee is not to pay for 
these average household goods; it’s 
to print ?yers, organize concerts, 
and bring petting zoos to campus, 
among other activities. As a result, 
the CPI is an inaccurate model for 
price increases and a bad measure 
for estimating the increase of prices 
in materials and goods that student 
groups actually buy.
Similarly, according to Mark’s 
own graphs in his presentation, the 
actual revenue student organiza-
tions bring in has remained rela-
tively unchanged since 2010. Why 
has the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC) continually set, as Mark put it, 
“large fundraising expectations” on 
student groups when they haven’t 
been able to meet said expectations? 
The JFC should have understood and 
adjusted for the obviously unrealistic 
fundraising expectations it is putting 
on student groups.
For example, in the 2012 bud-
get, the overall expected revenue 
of groups was about $900,000, yet 
the JFC requested $1.2 million in 
revenue. That $300,000 difference is 
huge and suggests that the JFC  does 
not understand how student organi-
zations operate and what they can 
realistically accomplish. 
Moreover, why has the JFC al-
lowed the Committee on Student Or-
ganizations to acknowledge so many 
groups — an estimated 300 by the 
end of this academic year — when 
JFC members have known for years 
about limited funds? 
Carnegie Mellon is vastly im-
proved by having such a diversity of 
organizations and avenues for stu-
dents to get involved, but there is a 
current redundancy in the missions 
and goals of numerous student orga-
nizations. We acknowledge that stu-
dent government has been working 
toward combining student groups to 
avoid such overlap, but this should 
not have even become a problem in 
the ?rst place.
JFC ultimately needs to change 
the budgeting process and metrics. 
Until this happens, organizations 
will still have budget issues that need 
to be resolved. 
The increased student activities 
fee would be immensely helpful for 
the student organizations on cam-
pus, but the proposal of the increase 
must be based on relevant data and 
realistic expectations. Additionally, 
current efforts to reduce costs and 
eliminate redundancies must be pur-
sued more strongly.

Well, to put it into terms any 
hardcore fan of the show Commu-
nity would understand, it looks like 
NBC “Britta’d” it again.
For those of you not enamored 
with the students at Greendale Com-
munity College, this means the net-
work screwed up. It is bad enough 
that, going into this fourth season, 
NBC ?red creator and executive 
producer Dan Harmon, but now it 
seems NBC feels that the show is not 
important enough to merit a proper 
premiere. If this is how the airing 
of season four is going to play out, 
I’d have much rather seen the show 
cancelled at the end of season three, 
which I felt wrapped up everything 
quite nicely anyway.
Yet the question remains: Why 
bring the show back from extinction 
just to continue messing with it?
Unsurprisingly, reports seem to 
indicate that some of NBC’s new 
comedies aren’t doing so well — 
they’re doing so poorly, in fact, that 
even the meager ratings Community 
usually brings in would be a step up, 
so the network might move Commu-
nity back to Thursdays as a lead-in, 
as speculated by entertainment blog 
Vulture. According to The Hollywood 
Reporter, the network just did this 
with Whitney by cancelling Animal 
Practice, yet Community remains up 
in the air.
Alternatively, it could be that 
NBC wants to double down on the 
success of the few sitcoms it has that 
are doing okay, such as Go On, and 
thus not waste its efforts on promot-
ing Community.
In either case, my resentment 
comes from the fact that NBC 
knows that any time slot they put 
Community in will gather the same 
core viewers, like myself, who have 
watched it from the beginning. Com-
munity actually gets a signi?cant 
portion of its views from online and 
DVR as well, something that net-
work executives have yet to grasp.
I am still baf?ed by the fact that 
network television executives mess 
around with their most critically ac-
claimed shows that have dedicated 
audiences. They focus on their sim-
ple, trite, safe shows that garner the 
big ratings because those equal big 
bucks. Money is their bottom line 
— but when you have a niche to ?ll, 
why not try to please the fans who 
in theory have tastes must less capri-
cious than the average viewers?
Maybe that’s the problem, 
though: High-brow shows outside of 
basic cable and subscription-based 
networks just don’t have any appeal 
to the average American. I think that 
instead of trying to become more in 
tune with what the public wants, 
good shows like Community should 
stick to their guns. If they fail, at 
least they’ll have failed without sell-
ing out. 
And hey, there’s always the Ar-
rested Development route of coming 
back with new episodes on Net?ix 
seven years later.
Trouble for Community evident with premiere
Fellow Tartans,
Anyone who is at all familiar 
with our community knows that 
Carnegie Mellon University is a very 
special place. We build robots, write 
sonnets, sing operas, crunch num-
bers — and that’s just the start of 
it. Our interests are eclectic, and as 
a community we could not be more 
proud of this.
Carnegie Mellon students are ex-
traordinarily passionate. Whether 
said passion be directed toward our 
sorority or fraternity, our debate 
team, our service group, or our resi-
dence hall, in one way or another 
every Carnegie Mellon student has 
that intense Tartan pride inside of 
them.
Given that our university is so 
diverse and our interests so varied, 
we’ve never been the type of student 
body that comes together in its en-
tirety for the weekly Saturday foot-
ball game — but there is no reason 
that we can’t be.
This coming Saturday marks 
the ?nal home game of the Carn-
egie Mellon football season and 
we wanted to make it special. Our 
football players have had a tremen-
dous season. Not only is the football 
team 5–3, but Will and myself have 
enjoyed an incredible sense of com-
munity and school spirit at all of this 
season’s games. For the ?nal home 
game of the season, we wanted to 
combine the student body’s unique 
expression of spirit with the game 
day atmosphere in a competition 
that we are hoping will become an 
annual event.
It is for these reasons that we 
have put together the Carnegie Mel-
lon Organization GameDay Com-
petition. At the Saturday football 
game, which starts at noon at Ges-
ling Stadium, all student organiza-
tions, residence halls, Greek houses, 
and sports teams will be encouraged 
to compete for the Carnegie Mellon 
Organization GameDay Cup.
The winner will be determined 
by three different competitive cat-
egories: attendance, creativity, and 
spirit. Groups will earn points for 
every member that shows up in their 
organization or Carnegie Mellon 
gear and checks in with our rep-
resentatives at the entrance to the 
stands.
Attendance scores will also be 
categorized to re?ect the size of the 
organization and ensure that small-
er organizations are given as much 
of a chance at winning as larger resi-
dence halls or Greek houses. Groups 
can earn points for creativity by de-
signing banners, signs, or shirts that 
support our football team. We will 
also be roaming the stands and giv-
ing points to those groups who are 
exemplifying school spirit through 
cheering and other means of sup-
port.
The winners will receive the 
Carnegie Mellon Organization 
GameDay Cup, prizes, and free ca-
tering for one of their events, pro-
vided by the Student Body President 
and Student Body Vice President.
You can learn more about the 
Carnegie Mellon Organization 
GameDay Competition by visiting 
our Facebook page, facebook.com/
cmusbp. We are so excited about the 
potential of this event, and hope to 
see you all there.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Jennifer Coloma
We become frightened easily at The Tartan, and Halloween is this week. So we asked,
What is the scariest thing about Carnegie Mellon?

The tech wizards at Apple are at 
it again. Greeting spectators at the 
California Theatre in San Jose less 
than two months after the iPhone 5’s 
announcement, CEO Tim Cook and 
other executives unveiled a new fam-
ily of iPads and Macs. 
Among the variety of hardware 
added to Apple’s top-tier product 
line, a new breed of iPad — the iPad 
Mini — stole the spotlight as the 
event’s biggest news. Although the 
iPad Mini will probably produce re-
cord pro?ts, as expected from any 
new Apple product, the device was 
announced too late and with too 
high a price point to be considered a 
milestone for the company.
Despite boasting a smaller screen 
than the iPad, Apple promises that 
the iPad Mini will offer everything its 
larger sibling does. Consumers will 
get all the perks of the iPad Mini’s 
brother — tons of apps, an e-reader, 
a web browser, you name it — in a 
more compact form.
The iPad Mini is a great new of-
fering that not only gives consumers 
a larger selection of Apple tablets, 
but also provides developers with 
a new platform for their software. 
According to Adam Najberg of The 
Wall Street Journal, the iPad Mini 
could spur the development of tablet 
gaming because of its smaller screen 
— just the right size for portable 
gaming.
That being said, the tablet’s 16GB 
entry-level model sells for $329. 
Compared to the $199 price tag of 
Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD and Barnes 
& Noble’s Nook HD, the iPad Mini 
is an expensive piece of hardware, 
maybe too expensive for consumers 
on a budget. 
Why spend an extra $130 when 
there are products on the market 
that are just as compelling? Unless 
Apple’s ecosystem of content is im-
portant to the consumer, there might 
not be a reason to justify spending 
the extra money.
In addition to wondering why 
the device’s price is so high, another 
question must be asked: Why did 
Apple wait so long to launch the iPad 
Mini?
The original Kindle Fire was an-
nounced over a year ago on Sept. 
28, while the Nook Color — running 
Android — was released in late 2010. 
Other miniature tablets, such as the 
original Samsung Galaxy Tab, were 
also released over a year ago. 
If the iPad Mini was released 
around the time of the ?rst portable 
tablets, it may have been considered 
a revolutionary competitor. The de-
vice is de?nitely still an enticing op-
tion in the tablet market, but it seems 
more like an afterthought than what 
could have been a show-stealing 
product.
Even more disconcerting is Ap-
ple’s choice to launch the iPad Mini 
in October, along with the fourth 
generation iPad. Why didn’t Apple 
launch the iPad Mini with the third 
generation iPad earlier this year or 
wait until the spring, when iPads 
have traditionally been launched, to 
reveal the newest tablets?
The iPad Mini will surely be a hit 
for the holiday season. Loved ones of 
all ages will rip open their presents 
to ?nd the shiny new Apple-branded 
tablet. 
In fact, this holiday season may be 
one of Apple’s best seasons yet. Still, 
to many consumers, their third gen-
eration iPad or iPad 2 still feels brand 
new. 
For customers who look forward 
to buying the latest Apple technol-
ogy, the thought of buying the iPad 
Mini after purchasing an iPad a few 
months earlier may seem unreason-
able. Even die-hard fans could ?nd 
Apple’s latest product launch to be 
more of a nuisance than a reason to 
pull out their credit cards.

Undecided voting stems from lack of appealing candidates
iPad Mini release is too little, too late
WILLIAM PARK

I am an undecided voter, and 
lately I’ve been taking a lot of heat. 
People are frustrated that after three 
presidential debates and months of 
manipulative advertising, I have yet 
to make up my mind. The future of 
our country lies in the choice I make, 
and I am taking my sweet time. 
What’s wrong with me? A lot, but I’m 
not the only one to blame for my in-
decision.
Frankly, I wouldn’t be in this po-
sition if we had better candidates. I 
couldn’t agree more when people say 
that this is the election for the “least 
worst” candidate. If only former gov-
ernor of Alaska Sarah Palin were 
running. Instead, we have two can-
didates who are both ?awed in less 
shallow ways.
I like President Barack Obama as 
a person. Had I been of age in 2008, 
I would have voted for him. His mes-
sage of hope had me hooked. Howev-
er, four years later, the disappearance 
of this positivism in favor of acerbic 
attacks against the opposition is what 
frustrates me most. Where is that 
message of hope now? Maybe we 
do need change, and maybe it starts 
with changing the person in of?ce.
But should I vote for Republican 
presidential candidate Mitt Romney 
just because he is the only alterna-
tive? It’s complicated. Romney is very 
unlikable. He ?ips and ?ops too often. 
Although he’s unlikable, that doesn’t 
mean he can’t ?x the economy.
Romney’s main selling point is that 
the incumbent hasn’t done enough 
for the economy and that he can do 
a better job. However, the Republi-
can candidate needs a more plausible 
and convincing plan. I would like to 
have faith, but the math for his eco-
nomic recovery simply doesn’t add 
up — not without the loopholes he is 
hesitant to name, and not with his in-
tended tax cuts. On the other hand, I 
don’t know how I feel about Obama’s 
economic plan because I don’t think 
it exists. Maybe he thinks no plan will 
look good next to Romney’s. But he 
has to show us something, because 
his record is not that strong.
But there is one more person who 
also makes my decision so agonizing: 
the decided voter. Secretly, I’m jeal-
ous of that ability to make a big deci-
sion and stick with it, yet I marvel at 
how many can wholeheartedly back 
either of these candidates. The decid-
ed voters’ biases and unconditional 
support make me want to defend and 
support the candidate they oppose. 
At the same time, their arguments do 
a convincing job of making me lean 
their way.
But the vehemently partisan voter 
is also the root of what’s wrong with 
our political system. After all, in a de-
mocracy we select our leaders, and 
our thirst for harmless ?xes has left 
us with candidates too well versed 
in manipulation and empty prom-
ises. We need to make better choices. 
To do this, we cannot be voters who 
respond to the negativity that is our 
candidates’ favorite form of persua-
sion. We have to cheer louder when 
they show us their vision but recog-
nize when we’re being lied to. Most 
importantly, we have to recognize 
that our leaders re?ect our own 
strengths and weaknesses, and that 
to have leaders of great character re-
quires reconsidering our own values.
Maybe I’m being too cynical, and 
maybe I’m harping too much on our 
politicians’ negative attributes and 
our sorry standards. But deep down, 
I think I could be a romantic. I want 
to believe in government and its lead-
ers. I want to believe that we will do 
a better job of choosing these leaders.
In the meantime, this presidential 
race is just two proud politicians run-
ning for of?ce. If you have decided 
who to vote for, great. I just ask that 
you give me some space while I make 
my own decision.
CHLOE THOMPSON
In The Tartan’s last issue, Anna 
Walsh wrote a wonderful article on 
Ms. CMU and its “Who Needs Femi-
nism?” campaign. Her conclusion 
was that Carnegie Mellon still needs 
feminism because of the sexism that 
still exists on campus. I agree with 
her 110 percent. Sexism is perva-
sive, not just on this campus but 
pretty much everywhere you look. 
But feminism ful?lls another, 
equally critical function. Feminism 
is important because it reminds us 
that we learn things we are never 
explicitly told.
No one in my life ever said, 
“Chloe, when you react to some-
thing emotionally, people will prob-
ably think it’s because you’re a girl,” 
or, “Once you hit the whole puberty 
thing, people are going to start see-
ing you as a sexual object. Seriously, 
your boobs have the potential to out-
weigh your opinion.” 
No one ever said, “It’s okay when 
boys have frequent, casual sex — be-
yond okay, it’s actually a good thing! 
It means he’s virile. But if you do, 
someone’s probably going to call 
you a slut.”
No one had to tell me these things 
because I absorbed that knowledge 
on my own. That’s the kind of in-
formation that ?lters through when 
people call a man who has mul-
tiple sexual partners a player, but a 
woman who has the same number 
of partners a whore, or when people 
look at a woman in a prominent po-
sition and say, “She’s there because 
she’s a woman.”
This subtle absorption of ste-
reotypes and prejudice is the true 
enemy of modern feminism. The 
problem isn’t that boys are told that 
women exist as sexual objects; it’s 
that almost every story we hear con-
cludes with an ending like, “And the 
guy got the girl in the end.” We’ve 
heard that phrase so many times 
that there is a silent “of course” 
tacked onto the end.
This concept implies that hard 
work and being somehow wor-
thy enough will drop an attractive 
woman into a guy’s lap like a prize. 
Human relationships are not like 
gumball machines. You don’t insert 
a quarter and get a person.
Just to be clear: No one is attack-
ing individuals over these issues. 
Most guys I know clam up immedi-
ately in the face of a discussion about 
sexism, because they feel these dis-
cussions are personal attacks. They 
aren’t supposed to be. Sexism is in-
grained into us from birth as a social 
and institutional problem; everyone 
participates in it and perpetuates it.
When I hear about a guy who has 
“gone through” three girls in a single 
week, a little voice in my head mur-
murs, “He’s a guy. They’re like that.” 
This is not an admiring observation 
on my part, but it isn’t a fair one ei-
ther. And when I hear about a girl 
doing something similar? The voice 
whispers, “Slut.” I try to silence that 
voice at every opportunity, because 
that girl’s life and body are not mine 
and therefore not my business, and 
there is absolutely nothing wrong 
with embracing one’s sexuality.
The effects of being raised in an 
inherently sexist system do not dis-
appear overnight. Sometimes they 
do not disappear at all. I don’t care 
about how much sex people have. 
But I’ve grown up in a world that 
permits and encourages nosing into 
other people’s lives.
Feminism gives me the ability to 
see these prejudices in myself and 
to understand where they come 
from. In her article, Walsh wrote, 
“Feminism gives us the space, the 
vocabulary, and the strength to ad-
dress [these social issues] head-on.” 
Feminism also gives us the means to 
understand how the world molds us, 
when we don’t even realize that we 
are being shaped at all.

Tartans tie in scoreless game
ABBY SMITH
Junior Staffwriter
Despite dominating offen-
sively, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team played 
to a 0–0 tie against New York 
University last Friday after-
noon, putting the Tartans at 
a 3–1–1 University Athletic 
Association (UAA) conference 
record.
In the ?rst half, the Tartans 
attempted ?ve shots against 
the New York University Vio-
lets, all of which were blocked 
by the dominant Violet de-
fense.
The Tartans continued 
their strong offensive effort 
as the team earned ?ve corner 
kicks in the ?rst eight minutes 
of the half. Players including 
senior defender Mitra Ebrahi-
mi, sophomore forward Savi-
na Reid, sophomore defender 
Lauren Simicich, and junior 
defender Rachel Contopoulos 
made attempts at goals.
Junior goalie Anna Albi 
had an excellent game, high-
lighted by a save on a header 
by New York University’s se-
nior forward Serra Turmay 
during the 56th minute.
The Tartans continued 
with promising goal attempts 
into overtime, but the game 
was kept scoreless by New 
York University sophomore 
goalie Meg Patten.
At 92 minutes, junior for-
ward Alex Venegas made a 
back pass to ?rst-year forward 
Louisa Pendergast, but Patten 
dived to knock the ball away.
At 95 minutes, senior 
Brianna Magill made a last–
ditch effort to score, but once 
again, Patten didn’t give her 
the chance.
“The team fought extreme-
ly hard against a talented 
New York University team,” 
senior mid?elder Stephanie 
Hare said. “Unfortunately, 
we couldn’t get the ball in the 
back of the net. We are us-
ing our momentum to hope-
fully get a big win in our next 
game. The team is working re-
ally hard and ?ghting for each 
other every UAA battle.”
The Tartans will face 
tough UAA competition with 
their ?nal in-season game at 
home this Saturday at 3 p.m., 
against currently undefeated 
Emory University.

Men’s soccer tallies third win
GABRIELLE WEST
Junior Staffwriter
The men’s soccer team 
added another University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
win Friday afternoon after 
defeating the New York Uni-
versity Violets; the team is 
now 11–2–1 and 3–1–1 in the 
UAA. The game ended with a 
score of 4–1.
“The team outlook is very 
positive right now,” said se-
nior Ben Bryant, who took 
two of the team’s 17 shots on 
Friday. “We are feeling great 
about how we played yester-
day against NYU. They are a 
solid team, and we were able 
to score four on them. We 
moved the ball very well, and 
had many scoring chances as 
a result.”
The Tartans put their ?rst 
goal on the scoreboard at the 
34-minute mark, when ?rst-
year mid?elder Connor Webb 
made his ?rst goal of his col-
lege career with an assist from 
junior forward Max Tassano. 
Just three minutes later, the 
Tartans increased the de?cit 
to 2–0 when Bryant assisted a 
corner kick to junior defender 
Cole Christensen, who head-
ed the ball in net for another 
goal.
Within the ?rst 15 min-
utes of the second half, the 
Tartans scored again. Tassano 
?nished this goal after a long 
throw from sophomore de-
fender Jakob Rohwer. Before 
the halfway point in the sec-
ond period, the Violets scored 
their ?rst and only goal off a 
penalty kick.
The Tartans answered the 
Violets’ goal with a goal of 
their own just four minutes 
later, when sophomore for-
ward Daniel Kursman-Neri 
?nished an assist from Chris-
tensen.
The game’s conclusion left 
the Tartans to look forward 
to another UAA game against 
Emory University at home

Ultimate Frisbee takes ?rst place in Fall Brawl tournament
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
One of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Ultimate Frisbee teams, Mr. 
Yuk, hit the road and traveled 
to Versailles, Oh., for the Fall 
Brawl tournament earlier this 
month. The Fall Brawl was 
the ?rst tournament in which 
Carnegie Mellon split fully 
into an A team and a B team. 
Carnegie Mellon’s A team en-
tered the Fall Brawl as the No. 
1 seed.
Mr. Yuk faced Case West-
ern Reserve University’s B 
team, Ohio Northern Univer-
sity, and Bluffton University, 
winning all three games on 
the ?rst tournament day. Mr. 
Yuk only surrendered seven 
points throughout all three 
games and was able to play a 
large portion of its roster on 
the day.
Mr. Yuk was not seriously 
tested until it faced Ohio State 
University’s split squad team, 
which was largely composed 
of Ohio State’s A team. Mr. 
Yuk took a 10–5 lead, but 
let Ohio State crawl back to 
11–10 before winning 12–10. 
Sophomore Reid Almand 
scored the ?nal point with a 
nice layout grab off senior Ben 
McGrath.
The weather conditions on 
the second day of the tourna-
ment were rough, featuring 
20 miles per hour winds. 
Mr. Yuk had a ?rst round 
bye, with their ?rst game 
against Case Western Re-
serve’s A team. After Mr. Yuk 
started strong, scoring four 
times straight, it let Case 
Western come right back, 
losing 8–7. However, Mr. Yuk 
came back to win in the end 
with a score of 9–8.
Mr. Yuk faced a less chal-
lenging test in the semi?nals 
against the Wright State Uni-
versity squad. Mr. Yuk was 
victorious 9–5. This game fea-
tured entirely zone defense. 
In the ?nals, Mr. Yuk found 
itself facing Kenyon College 
in constant rain and strong 
winds, so the teams agreed to 
play to seven points. Mr. Yuk 
ended up breaking several 
times early to win 7–4. 
First-year Ross Ellison was 
the MVP of that game: He 
cleared two opponents for a 
Callahan, meaning he caught 
the disc in the other team’s 
end-zone.
“We came to the tourna-
ment with a few goals. We 
wanted to get our upperclass-
men back and playing to-
gether after summer break,” 
said electrical and computer 
engineering master’s student 
Nipunn Koorapati. “We want-
ed our new players to show 
off. And we wanted to win the 
tournament. I’d say we did all 
three.” 
Mr. Yuk’s next tourna-
ment will be on Nov. 18, and 
will be hosted at home. The 
tournament will be a round 
robin against the University 
of Pittsburgh (2012 National 
Champions), Ohio University 
(2012 Nationals Quali?ers), 
Ohio State University, and 
Pennsylvania State University. 
The games will be played in 
Gesling Stadium and on the 
Intramural Fields.

SPORTS COMMENTARYGiants take a 3–0 lead in series 
CARL GLAZER

The long grind of the base-
ball season is ?nally coming to 
a close with the San Francisco 
Giants and the Detroit Tigers 
facing off in the World Series. 
Although this matchup may 
not have the glamour of a 
New York Yankees versus Los 
Angeles Dodgers battle, it is 
certainly not lacking in excite-
ment. With three Cy Young 
winners (Pitchers Barry Zito 
and Tim Lincecum for the Gi-
ants and Justin Verlander for 
the Tigers), one MVP (Ver-
lander), and a triple crown 
winner (Detroit third base-
man Miguel Cabrera), this 
series is full of talent, both on 
the mound and at the plate.
Both teams have faced up-
hill battles during the regular 
season. The Giants had all-
star out?elder Melky Cabrera 
suspended for testing positive 
for performance enhancing 
drugs during a random drug 
test. At the time, he was lead-
ing the league in batting and 
led the core of the lineup. 
Lincecum, who came into this 
season as the Giants’ unques-
tionable ace, had a terrible 
season ending with an earned 
run average over ?ve and be-
ing moved to the bullpen for 
part of the season and the 
playoffs.
The Tigers lost slugging 
catcher and ?rst baseman Vic-
tor Martinez for the year to an 
ACL tear in January, prompt-
ing the managers to sign pe-
rennial all-star ?rst baseman 
Prince Fielder. This signing 
forced Cabrera to move across 
the diamond to third base, 
causing previous starter Bran-
don Inge to be moved out of 
the lineup and weakening the 
Tigers defensively.
While each team needed 
all ?ve games to make it out of 
its divisional series, the teams’ 
performance in the league 
championship series could 
not have been more different. 
The Tigers easily dispatched 
the slumping Yankees, sweep-
ing them in four games to 
clinch the American League 
Pennant. The Giants, on the 
other hand, quickly fell be-
hind 3–1 to the St. Louis Car-
dinals and were forced to win 
three straight games to move 
on. While the Tigers were at 
home resting, Giants players 
were ?ghting for their lives 
and, in the process, gaining 
momentum and con?dence.
In Game 1 last Wednes-
day, the Tigers thought they 
had a sure?re win with Ver-
lander matching up against 
Zito, who has struggled since 
signing long term in San Fran-
cisco back in 2006. But Zito, 
with his array of excellent off-
speed pitches, was the domi-
nant pitcher, giving up only 
one run in ?ve-and-two-thirds 
innings. Meanwhile, Verland-
er struggled, giving up ?ve 
runs in only four innings, as 
San Francisco cruised to a 
8–3 victory. Giants third base-
man Pablo Sandoval had the 
game of his life, hitting three 
home runs in his ?rst three at 
bats. He is the fourth player 
in World Series history to 
accomplish this feat.
Game 2 on Thursday ap-
peared to be another win on 
paper for the Tigers, with 
struggling Giants pitcher 
Madison Bumgarner facing 
off against the Tigers’ Doug 
Fister. While both pitchers 
took shut outs into the sev-
enth inning, the Giants again 
pulled out a 2–0 victory, scor-
ing on a double play in the 
seventh and a Hunter Pence 
sacri?ce ?y in the eighth.
When the series moved 
from San Francisco to Detroit 
for Game 3 on Saturday, the 
Tigers hoped that the ridicu-
lous luck that had been fol-
lowing the Giants would stay 
in the bay. Unfortunately for 
Detroit, the Giants pitching 
staff shut down the Tigers’ 
bats once again as San Fran-
cisco cruised to a 2–0 victory 
behind starter Ryan Vogel-
song and relievers Lincecum 
and Sergio Romo. The Tigers 
were not without chances, 
but their struggling offense 
simply could not capitalize on 
their opportunities.
Overall, the Giants have 
both the momentum and the 
pitching matchups the rest of 
the way to close out the series 
after taking their command-
ing 3–0 series lead. Unless the 
Tigers can make history and 
win the next four games, San 
Francisco is going to win its 
second World Series in three 
years.

Over the weekend, the Tar-
tans traveled to Alliance, Oh., 
to play in a tri-match hosted 
by Mt. Union University. The 
Tartans ?nished the tourna-
ment with a 1–1 record after 
playing the No. 10 Raiders of 
Mt. Union and the Student 
Princesses of Heidelberg Uni-
versity. The Tartans’ overall 
record now stands at 14–16.
Carnegie Mellon opened 
the weekend with Mt. Union 
as its ?rst opponent. The 
game was hard-fought, but 
the Raiders came out on top 
and won in three games. The 
scores of the three games 
were 23–25, 23–25, and 15–
25, respectively.
The second match played 
by the Tartans was against 
Heidelberg University, which 
resulted in a Tartan victory. 
The match went to ?ve 
games, where the Tartans 
won the ?rst (25–22), third 
(27–25), and ?fth (15–13). 
The offense was led by 
sophomore right side hit-
ter Ali Celentano, who had 
22 kills; junior outside hit-
ter Senna Parsa, who had 16 
kills; and junior outside hitter 
Rachel Miller, with 13 kills. 
The defensive highlight of 
the match came from junior 
libero Ali Nichols, who had 25 
digs.
“We played as a team and 
worked really hard to focus 
on every point,” said senior 
defensive specialist Kasey La-
Mothe.
The Tartans have conclud-
ed their regular season play. 
The volleyball team will head 
to Atlanta, Ga., next week to 
play Case Western Reserve 
University in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Tournament Championships.
As a senior, it will be La-
Mothe’s last game in her 
career as a Tartan. Of it, La-
Mothe said, “I hope to make it 
a game worth remembering.”

The Tartans lost a low-
scoring bout in St. Louis on 
Saturday to the Washington 
University in St. Louis Bears, 
25–3. The loss brings the Tar-
tans to 5–3 on the season and 
the Bears to 3–5. 
Despite the loss, junior 
wide receiver Tim Kikta 
moved within 63 yards of the 
Carnegie Mellon single-sea-
son receiving yards record. 
He tallied 56 receiving yards 
against the Bears. 
“Tim is one of the hardest 
working guys on the team. 
Him and [junior quarterback] 
Rob [Kalkstein] worked hard 
all summer to establish a 
strong connection,” said se-
nior running back Jake Nar-
done. “He’s always been a 
guy who worked hard for all 
the right reasons.”
Offensively, the Tartans 
struggled to get anything go-
ing all game. Kalkstein com-
pleted 16 of 30 passes for 128 
yards and failed to ?nd the 
end zone. Additionally, the 
Tartans only rushed for 98 
yards, with ?rst-year running 
back Troy Witt leading the 
way with 47 yards.
On the bright side, the 
Carnegie Mellon defense 
looked sharp, holding the 
Bears to just 15 points and 
328 total yards. Sophomore 
safety Shae Sealey and se-
nior outside linebacker Owen 
Parker each had an intercep-
tion as well.
Unfortunately, the offense 
could not capitalize on the 
stellar defense.
The Tartans average 219.6 
passing yards per game, and 
the run game has averaged 
188.2 yards per game. But 
the Bears’ defense really sti-
?ed the Tartans’ offense, as 
their output was subpar on 
Saturday.
The Bears’ defensive line 
put pressure on Kalkstein 
throughout the game, sack-
ing him four times for a total 
of 18 yards lost. The Bears’ ju-
nior defensive lineman Seth 
Wight had two of the four 
sacks. Additionally, the Bears 
accumulated nine tackles for 
a total of 25 yards lost.
This is the Tartans’ second 
consecutive loss, and their 
third loss in their last four 
games after starting the sea-
son 4–0.
The Tartans look to regain 
momentum this Saturday in 
their home game against the 
University of Chicago.

New to the Carnegie Mel-
lon women’s tennis team is 
the fun and fearless ?rst-year 
Elizabeth Martin, hailing from 
St. Simon’s Island, Ga. Since 
the beginning of the season, 
Martin has consistently been 
one of the top players on the 
team, in spite of her transition 
into college life.
“I’ve been pleased with my 
performance and my team’s 
performance so far this sea-
son. Even though college ten-
nis is more pressure than high 
school, I think I’ve adjusted 
well,” Martin said. “I really 
love playing for the team.”
In the Carnegie Mellon In-
vitational last month, Martin 
paired with sophomore Jana 
Motie to defeat Duquesne 
University 8–5 and won her 
singles match 8–2. Her domi-
nance continued into the ITA 
Regional, where she was orig-
inally ninth-ranked and ad-
vanced to a highly contested 
championship match against 
sophomore Megan Buell of 
Washington & Lee University.
In addition to her strong 
singles matches, Martin 
paired with sophomore Bryn 
Raschke to defeat senior Sal-
lie Grif?n and sophomore Al-
lison Hupalo of Washington & 
Lee 8–2 in the quarter?nals. 
The pair then dropped the 
semi?nal match to Buell and 
junior Claire Cahill of Wash-
ington & Lee in a tightly con-
tested 8–6 match.
Her passionate tennis play-
ing has not gone unnoticed by 
her teammates. Raschke de-
scribed Martin as the “ideal 
partner, who always keeps the 
atmosphere fun on the team.”
“Elizabeth was really fun 
to play with,” she said. “We 
laughed and joked a lot, which 
is one of the reasons I love 
doubles, so it was great hav-
ing a partner who was really 
enjoying herself. She’s so fun, 
and the way she chooses to 
end points by whacking her 
backhand for winners was 
awesome. She was always 
willing to try something new. 
ITA’s really shown how solid 
of a player Elizabeth is.”
The admiration seems to 
be mutual, as Martin said that 
she decided to come to Carn-
egie Mellon because of the 
“close-knit atmosphere” of 
the 11-member team.
“While we always are 
tough in competition, we love 
to have fun and joke with 
each other,” Martin said. “Our 
group text messages always 
make me giggle.”
Along with her laughs 
come her tennis aspirations; 
Martin hopes to win a nation-
al title as “either an individual 
or a team” during her college 
career. “An NCAA Division III 
championship would be ab-
solutely incredible,” Martin 
said.
“Elizabeth has been a 
great young addition to our 
roster. She brings a positive 
and hard-working attitude to 
practice every day, and I ex-
pect an excellent rookie sea-
son from her,” assistant coach 
Mike Belmonte said.
Martin is not only serious 
about her tennis playing; she 
has high expectations regard-
ing her schoolwork as well. 
Currently a decision science 
major, she hopes to go to 
medical school to become an 
allergist.
“I ?nd the immune system 
fascinating,” Martin said. “I 
know, I’m so weird.”
With a full course load, 
Martin is the ?rst to say, “It’s 
so much work.” But, always 
keeping a smile on her face, 
she said “my favorite class is 
chemistry when I get extra 
credit.”
The tennis season will pick 
up again in February, where a 
bubbly Martin looks forward 
to “representing the Carnegie 
Mellon team and something 
other than myself. I feel seri-
ous and committed when I 
[put on] that Tartan uniform. 
And I don’t like to lose while 
wearing it.”

The men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams 
put together excellent perfor-
mances to open their seasons. 
The men’s team won three of 
four races, and the women’s 
team won all four at the Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) Invite this past Friday 
and Saturday.
“This weekend was a pret-
ty good weekend, being our 
?rst meet and all. It was a long 
weekend and the team had 
somewhat of a slow start, but 
we were able to ?nish strong 
as a team,” sophomore Cole 
Um said. “Overall the meet 
de?nitely helped bring the 
team closer together.”
In the men’s 200-yard 
medley relay, sophomores 
Anton Razanav and Um and 
juniors Terrence Wong and 
Eddie Sears ?nished second 
with a time of 1:37.86.
Razanav also took second 
in the 100-meter backstroke 
with a time of 54.41.
Senior Brandon Yee won 
?rst place in the 200-yard 
butter?y, and sophomore Da-
vid Campbell took third. First-
year Adam Pinson took ?fth in 
the same event.
The men’s swimmers were 
consistently top-three ?nish-
ers throughout the UAA In-
vite. In the 500-yard freestyle 
the Tartans grabbed second 
through ?fth place, with ?rst-
year Steven Geier placing sec-
ond with a time of 4:49.99.
On the women’s team, ju-
nior Soleil Phan led the Tar-
tans with three individual vic-
tories on Saturday.
Phan took ?rst in the 200-
yard freestyle, the 100-yard 
freestyle, and the 400-yard 
IM. Her times were 1:56.38, 
54.41, and 4:40.03, respec-
tively. Additionally, she took 
?rst place twice in team 
events. She was on the team 
that placed ?rst in the 400-
yard medley relay, along with 
?rst-years Kira Singhaus, Feli-
cia Wang, and Shieri Suzuka.
Phan was also on the squad 
that won the 200-yard medley 
relay, with Singhaus, Wang, 
and senior Breanna Stillo.
Singhaus was the victor in 
the 100-yard backstroke with 
a time of 1:00.43 and ?nished 
second in the 200-yard back-
stroke, losing only by 0.38 
seconds.
“We had some amazing 
swims, and we are doing great 
for this point in the season, 
especially with a huge propor-
tion of our team being new to 
the team and even new to the 
sport,” sophomore Wendy Liu 
said.
First-year Alicia Iott ?n-
ished ninth for the Tartans in 
a diving event, scoring 134.20 
points in the one-meter board 
event.
The men’s and women’s 
teams will compete again 
against Clarion University on 
Saturday at home. The meet 
begins at 11 a.m.

Writers read diverse prose
‘Pocketful of Prose’ presents engaging panel discussion
Looking at the panel members at the “Pocketful of 
Prose” reading and discussion last Thursday in the 
Steinberg Auditorium, one immediately noticed the 
differences between the three writers sitting at the 
table.
Amina Gautier, a ?ction writer and winner of the 
Flannery O’Connor Award for Short Fiction, sat at 
one end, looking polished and poised in a pencil 
dress. Kim Dana Kupperman, author of the award-
winning essay collection I Just Lately Started Buying 
Wings, relaxed at the other end, swaddled in long, 
?owing layers. Between them sat Stewart O’Nan — 
proli?c novelist, Pittsburgh resident, and moderator 
for the panel — wearing a worn-looking Pirates hat 
and chatting cheerily with audience members.
As it turned out, the writers and their works were as 
different from each other as their appearances would 
suggest, making for an interesting reading and an 
engaging panel discussion.
After associate professor of English Jane McCafferty 
brie?y introduced the speakers, O’Nan began the 
evening by reading from The Night Country, in 
which two teenagers grapple with their lives after 
surviving a car crash that killed three of their friends. 
The novel, which O’Nan dedicated to Ray Bradbury, 
is narrated from the ghostly perspective of one of the 
dead friends; it’s ?tting, then, that the writing style 
swirls dreamily as the narrator swoops through the 
suburban town and eventually makes his way back 
to the scene of the accident to recall it.
Kupperman followed by reading an essay called 
“Tell Me How Long the Train’s Been Gone: A Letter 
to James Baldwin on the 25th Anniversary of His 
Passing.” The essay, which she recently wrote for 
submission to the Hunger Mountain literary journal, 
addresses everything from environmentalism to 
racism, from American imperialism to this month’s 
presidential debates. Although the essay is loosely 
tied together around a train ride she takes from New 
York to Pennsylvania, it mostly feels didactic and 
heavy-handed as it lists off the author’s opinions.
Gautier, who received both her bachelor’s and 
master’s degrees in four years at Stanford University 
and is now an associate professor at DePaul 
University, then read “Push,” a short story from 
her book At-Risk. In the story, a young girl at an 
overcrowded inner-city elementary school is forced 
by her teacher to re?ect on the reasons why she 
picks on a fellow student. “Push” takes a narrow slice 
of time and uses it to give a lovely, lyrical glimpse 
into a young girl’s life.
Afterward, O’Nan led the panel discussion, during 
which the speakers delved into conversations on the 
short story format, the distinction between literary 
?ction and genre ?ction, and the ways that authors 
can play with genre conventions.
The writers’ differences worked to the discussion’s 
advantage: All of the writers were intelligent and 
well versed in literature, yet all had very different 
perspectives and opinions. The result was a lively 
and interesting conversation. O’Nan, in particular, 
made for a great moderator: Whenever Kupperman 
began to dominate the conversation, he would gently 
ease it back on track. Even though the conversation 
could have easily drifted off in an intellectually 
inaccessible direction, O’Nan’s down-to-earth 
approach kept the discussion engaging for the 
audience.
The conversation was interesting enough that 
an hour and a half easily ?ew by. The discussion 
could have continued on, but McCafferty regretfully 
announced that she would have to end the 
discussion, as it was getting late and there was 
pizza waiting in the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing 
Center. The small audience clapped loudly for the 
panelists, and trundled up the stairs to wrap up an 
evening of great writing and great conversation.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I’ve been hanging out with 
this girl quite a bit lately. 
I want to go out with her, 
but she treats me like one 
of her girlfriends. I’ll feel 
like I’m making progress, 
but then she’ll mention 
some dude she’s into who 
isn’t me. I thought I made 
my intentions clear, but I 
guess not. What should 
my next move be?
Thanks,

Dear GAL PAL,
If I were a lesser advice 
columnist, I’d talk to you 
about how you’ve been 
forced into the “friend zone.” 
Lucky for you, I’m not. See, 
that’s just something guys 
(and a few girls) say so they 
can blame all their problems 
on women. “You don’t want 
to go out with me? You’re 
just emotionally manipulating 
me to make yourself feel 
better!” Just stop it, guys; 
you’re making us all look 
bad.
You say you’ve made 
your intentions clear, but 
maybe you haven’t. Try 
to see if she’s into you. 
Although, frankly, it sounds 
to me like she’s not. If 
you’re unconvinced, then 
you could explicitly ask her 
out on a date. Looks like 
all you’ve done is make a 
new friend. How horrible. I 
know, it’s surprising, but you 
can be friends with women 
without trying to date them. 
You’re not in middle school 
anymore. It’s cool to be 
friends with girls.
Lady friends make the 
best wingmen,

Dear Patrick,
I missed the partying last 
week, but I want to put 
together a Halloween

without buying anything. 
Do you have any tips for a 
cheap, simple, and clever 
costume?
Thanks,

Dear COSTUMED,
How much you like my 
costume ideas will depend 
on how much you like puns. 
If you hate them, then just 
go ahead and put on a scarf 
and go as a hipster, because 
you’re lame and don’t like 
awesome things like puns. 
But for my pun-loving 
brethren, I have plenty of 
ideas.
Get a raggedy costume, 
some safety pins, and a 
bunch of sponges. Pin them 
to the shirt. If anyone asks, 
you’re “self-absorbed.” 
Wear a pair of sunglasses 
and carry around roses — a 
“blind date.” Have a bra and 
some spices? Make like an 
insecure middle-schooler 
and stuff! You’re a “spice 
rack.” Brown robe and a 
bag of Fritos? “Chip monk.” 
Cover a box of cereal in red 
paint and carry around a 
fake knife with some paint 
on it too. You’re a “cereal 
killer.” I’ll stop now; I’m sure 
your sides hurt from laughing 
so much. Thank me later.
Ha ha! Blind date,
Patrick Hoskins

It’s that time of year again. Your Facebook is ?ooded with 
invitations to Halloween parties, slasher fests, pumpkin 
patch frolicking, nights of horror — the list goes on. Yet 
upon attending these events, you are overwhelmed with 
downright bad costumes and a lack of Halloween spirit.
Invitations to these events include descriptions that tell 
girls to be whatever they want, as long as they add the 
word “slutty” to the costume description. Now, I’m all for 
expressing yourself, but what happened to good, clean 
Halloween fun that focused on ghouls, goblins, and witches 
instead of sexy nurses, teachers, and police of?cers?
This past week, I went to an event that embodied my 
idealized image of Halloween. Tucked away in Lawrenceville, 
Arsenal Bowling Lanes hosts a weekly college night on 
Tuesdays, complete with cheap bowling, booze, and a live 
band. This week, the bowling alley was decked out with 
skeletons, cobwebs, and the usual Halloween fare. The red 
velvet walls, the skeletons atop the alleyways, and the live 
band made for a great evening.
The band, aptly called The Graveyard Rockers, played 
psychobilly and surf rock tunes focused on zombies, 
Frankenstein, and all your favorite monsters. The tongue-
in-cheek references to science ?ction, horror, violence, and 
sex were quite a relief from the bevy of electronic dance 
music I’d grown accustomed to hearing during “Halloween” 
parties.
As soon as Thanksgiving comes, our ears will be assaulted 
with Christmas music; why isn’t this the case with 
Halloween music? If you dig around, you’ll ?nd that there 
are some great Halloween anthems out there that bring 
together the dark, fun, and ultimately over-sexualized 
aspects of Halloween. Take a break from your usual playlists 
and crank up some psychobilly. I would recommend you 
start with the compilations Halloween Hootenanny and 
Halloween A Go-Go.

RL Grime hypnotizes crowd
AB concert features excellent music, lacks Halloween spirit
AB Coffeehouse’s annual Halloween dance party 
featured electronic hip-hop artist RL Grime along 
with Sensitivity and Naan Naan, a DJ duo composed 
of senior business administration major and WRCT 
general manager Alex Price and School of Art 
alumnus and WRCT DJ Naeem Martinez-White. 
Despite taking some time to start, both the Carnegie 
Mellon DJ duo and RL Grime were successful in 
bringing Rangos to life.
This year’s party took place in Rangos Hall on 
Friday night and lasted from 8 p.m. to a bit after 
the planned 11 p.m. The original program featured 
L.A.-based glitch-hop DJ Shlohmo to perform with 
RL Grime, but Shlohmo cancelled his appearance in 
advance of Friday’s concert. 
The party was free with Carnegie Mellon student 
ID and $10 without, but a quick look in Rangos 
con?rmed that almost all attendees were students. 
Although the party was Halloween-themed, 
attempts to put this into effect were somewhat 
weak. A plastic skull ?lled with candy was the only 
sign of the holiday in sight.
After opening sets by DJ Salem (sophomore 
computer science major Salem Hilal) and DJ ReBase 
(junior information systems major Steve McQuaid), 
Sensitivity and Naan Naan presented back-to-back 
sets of deep, enchanting house music, occasionally 
lightened with a touch of more upbeat techno 
rhythms. The DJ set was accompanied by a truly 
mesmerizing laser show consisting of multicolored 
beams that shot through Rangos and danced around 
on the back wall to the rhythm of the techno house 
beats. The DJs themselves also contributed to the 
Halloween-based theme of the evening by sporting 
unidenti?able yet intimidating masks throughout 
their set.
Unfortunately, the ?rst set wasn’t attended by many 
people. Through the ?rst few songs, the dance ?oor 
was almost entirely empty and the few people that 
had already arrived lingered in the corners of the 
ballroom that the stage lights didn’t reach. However, 
this was not representative of the quality of the duo’s 
music, who put together an amazing show overall. 
The quality of the show was con?rmed toward the 
end of the set, when the dance ?oor was occupied 
by more than 30 students, zombies, a mosh pit, and 
even a few Japanese anime characters.
Sensitivity and Naan Naan handed the stage over 
to RL Grime around 9:30 p.m. The Los Angeles-
based DJ is known for his innovative approach to 
electronic music, marrying conventional electronic 
dance music with bass-driven hip-hop, a style often 
described as trap. Indeed, a change in frequency 
was obvious when RL Grime took the stage: His 
music’s gradual transformation in beats, culminating 
in ?oor-vibrating bass tones, was reminiscent of 
dubstep drops.
However, RL Grime’s music went a bit further than 
simple dubstep “wobble.” Drops were followed by 
loops from hip-hop songs with ampli?ed bass, and 
beats were more disjointed. His music was more 
successful than the ?rst set in bringing the audience 
to life, but this was also due to the fact that the 
audience had grown by this time. The musical 
experience could have only been ampli?ed by a 
better sound system, which may have let listeners 
feel the music’s bass to its full extent.
RL Grime put on a great set: He controlled the 
crowd, making it hold its collective breath in 
anticipation of an arriving bass drop and completely 
let go in an animalistic fashion once the bass had 
spread. The quality of music provided by Sensitivity 
and Naan Naan and RL Grime in this year’s 
Halloween party was, without question, impeccable.
The party as a whole, however, could have 
been taken out of the typical concert mold. As a 
Halloween party and not simply a show, more effort 
toward the nonmusical aspects of the evening 
would have made Friday night a true Halloween 
experience. Such effort would not only have made 
the event more of an actual party than solely a 
concert, but it also might have attracted a larger 
audience.

Once upon a time, the Carnegie Mellon School of Music 
whisked audiences into a magical show that twisted 
traditional fairy tales into a new story. This show, 
Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods, was presented last 
Thursday through Sunday in the Philip Chosky Theater 
in the Purnell Center for the Arts.
As always, the university’s talented students gave an 
amazing performance. Taking place during National 
Opera Week, the show went above and beyond the call 
of duty, relying not just on plot to draw viewers in.
Before the story was able to engage the audience, the 
set and costumes had already blown minds across 
the theater. The staging went far beyond the sets of 
many professional productions that theater-goers pay 
more than $80 to attend. Dominic Missimi, the visiting 
director and former director of musical theater at 
Northwestern University, chose to set the show in an 
attic, stuffed full with antique artifacts around which the 
story twisted and twined.
Rather than being over dramatic and taking away from 
the story as some wardrobes tend to do, the costumes 
complemented the story and characters, but remained 
visually interesting at the same time. The overall effect 
was a veritable feast for the eyes to enjoy while the 
ears were simply ringing with the skilled voices of the 
students.
The basic idea behind the musical’s genius plot is that 
there’s more to those beloved fairy tales than what we 
learned as children. The more generic characters of the 
baker (junior vocal performance major James Alexander) 
and his wife (junior vocal performance major Chloe 
Holgate) were joined by characters from childhood 
favorites: Cinderella, played by vocally angelic junior 
vocal performance and psychology double major Chelsea 
Ritenour; Jack from Jack in the Beanstalk, played by 
somehow simultaneously obnoxious and charming 
junior vocal performance major Nigel Rowe; and Little 
Red Riding Hood, played by junior vocal performance 
major Hannah Marks. These characters all recklessly 
make wishes that they believe will make them happier 
in the end, and the show describes their journey to the 
ful?llment of their wishes.
Along the way, of course, there are many obstacles to 
overcome, each accompanied by award-winning songs 
and important lessons to be learned. All of these twists 
and turns are narrated by a mysterious man (junior 
music composition major Sean Salamon) and agitated 
by the glittering and captivating witch (junior vocal 
performance major Olivia Vadnais). 
Into the Woods includes all the elements of a classic 
fairy tale, with a few dark surprises and many magical 
moments. Who doesn’t love a fairy tale reworked into 
something new and just as magical? When the costumes 
and staging are as tempting as a red poison apple and 
the voices and instrumentation are sweeter than a love 
song from Disney, you can’t possibly go wrong.
This show was the hidden gem of the week here on 
campus. Cast as the diamond in the rough in the 
hullabaloo surrounding Scotch’n’Soda’s Reefer Madness, 
Into the Woods was a deliciously dark, whimsical, and 
thrilling ride through the fairy tales of childhood. Bravo, 
and may the cast members live happily ever after 
knowing that they performed a captivating tale.

“Commie reefer queens want your kids.”
Statements like this, painted on the set and often 
voiced by actors, were the driving satire behind 
Scotch’n’Soda’s ?rst production of the school 
year, Reefer Madness, which played last Thursday 
through Saturday in McConomy Auditorium.
The musical, based loosely on the 1936 propaganda 
exploitation ?lm Tell Your Children, is terribly silly. 
The script is awful. It’s no Les Misérables — but it’s 
not supposed to be. In essence, Reefer is a political 
commentary on the ridiculousness of ’30s drug 
policy and radical conservatives who believed that 
marijuana was a more debilitating and addictive 
drug than heroin. Indeed, Reefer could have focused 
on meth rather than on marijuana; it would make 
much more sense, but wouldn’t be nearly as funny.
It makes one wonder what the makers of the 1936 
movie were using when they were ?lming — 
considering the time period, probably cocaine.
Reefer’s ?rst-time director, sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering and creative writing double 
major Bradley Plaxen, chose a great production that 
naturally caters to a college crowd. It was de?nitely 
sloppy at some points; the stage blackouts seemed 
nearly random, and the ?nal scene’s choreography 
had the actors practically tripping over each 
other. But the actors’ tangible enthusiasm and the 
bombastic musical numbers more than made up for 
any mishaps.
The audience would have lost interest without 
the enthralling opening number. The scene’s 
choreography, the brainchild of sophomore design 
major Sam Ahmed, was the best in the entire show: 
The ensemble’s fantastic, “marijuana-induced” 
dancing engaged audience members early on, 
daring them to hope for more.
And more they did receive, although not right 
away. Protagonist Jimmy Harper (?rst-year Dietrich 
student Zach Stuckelman) had a frog in his throat 
until he smoked his ?rst joint, after which he sang 10 
times better. Interestingly enough, the opposite was 
true for his girlfriend, Mary Lane (?rst-year Dietrich 
student Emma Harger), who played her goody-two-
shoes role well, but seemed stuck in that persona, 
even when she had to strip to her garters onstage 
and dominate unsuspecting marijuana dealer Ralph 
Wiley (sophomore vocal performance major Taylor 
Rawley).
While all the actors in Reefer Madness had 
substantial talent, there are a few who shined 
above the rest. Senior economics and statistics 
and decision science double major Will Weiner had 
sobering comments and straight-arrow acting that 
kept the show grounded. Rawley expertly played his 
college reefer junkie role, dominating the stage with 
his high-pitched giggling and lascivious nature.
Possibly the most outstanding presence was 
sophomore vocal performance major Joanna Latini 
as the con?icted Mae Coleman, who owns the reefer 
den run by her husband, Jack Perry (junior math 
major Billy Veer). Unable to choose between her 
addiction and her morals, she is the only character 
with whom the audience was able to empathize, and 
she navigates her frequent transitions from guilty 
addict to comic reinforcement seamlessly. Veer is a 
great actor, but dancing was his forte, especially his 
duo with Placard Girl (?rst-year computer science 
major Gail Wilson, also the production’s dance 
captain). Other choreography highlights included 
“Murder!”, the reprise of “Down at the Ol’ Five and 
Dime,” and “Listen to Jesus, Jimmy.”
It’s hard to imagine Reefer Madness succeeding 
anywhere but on a college campus, and it ?t right 
in at Carnegie Mellon. While probably not the best 
production Scotch’n’Soda has put together, it was 
ludicrously entertaining and should have been a 
required Halloween festivity for every student.
