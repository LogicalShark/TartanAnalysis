Voted for whoever talked the 
loudest
Terry Magnum, rush chair 
for the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Zeta chapter of Theta 
Kappa Omega (TKO), was 
voted into of?ce as Carnegie 
Mellon’s Student Body Presi-
dent during elections last Fri-
day after being accidentally 
mixed in with candidates on 
the ballot.
“I was at CMU for Free 
Condom Friday,” Magnum 
said during his foot massage 
by Senate Chair Marcus Ap-
plebee. 
“I thought they were giv-
ing them out at the elections 
meeting, but they turned out 
to be brightly colored bal-
lots. They still work as well, 
though. I think. Hey, Apple-
bee, dig into the heel more? 
Yeah, perfect.”
The students unaf?liated 
with Senate who attended 
the elections meeting — ?ve 
underclassmen in total — all 
voted for Magnum.
“I mean, he was just stand-
ing at the podium with an or-
ange ballot in his hand, look-
ing confused, but the other 
candidates were way worse,” 
sophomore acting major 
Terry Cleese said. “Akash 
[Singh] tried to program a 
robot to give the speech for 
him, but it just picked Oreos 
off of the snack table. Kimi 
[Salazar] was last, but she 
gave a 30-minute abstract for 
her speech, so by the time she 
got around to talking about 
her platform, I was the only 
person left, because they still 
had free reusable water bot-
tles to give out at the end. I 
have a collection.”
Former Student Body 
President Bill Beiner thinks 
that having a Pitt student 
take over the leading role will 
help the social atmosphere at 
Carnegie Mellon reach never-
before-seen heights.
“Let’s be honest with our-
selves: Do any of us actually 
know how to be social with 
one another?” Beiner asked 
rhetorically. “I’ll go ahead and 
answer that question: No! Ab-
solutely not. And Pitt students 
know exactly what to do. All 
you need are a disregard for 
personal space, a lack of prac-
tical etiquette, and lots and 
lots of alcohol.”
The Tartan tried to reach 
the current student body 
president for her opinion on 
the matter, but she could not 
be reached, since no one can 
remember who the SBP is.
Magnum asserts that his 
fraternity life will go unaffect-
ed by his recent appointment.
“I mean, yeah, TKO’s cred 
is going to go to sh** because 
their rush chair is running 
CMU,” Magnum said. “But 
once I turn this nerd hole 
into a party school, I’ll be like 
the albatross in that one cool 
poem; freshmen will come 
?ocking.”
At a TKO party last night, 
Magnum was downing shots 
at an alarming rate, and was 
left in a state of being hungov-
er that will likely last through 
April. While Magnum is inca-
pacitated, his vice president, 
a can of Natural Light, will be 
running all Student Senate 
operations.

Not much of a hat guy
Carnegie Mellon’s Coun-
seling and Psychological Ser-
vices (CAPS) department an-
nounced last Thursday that 
it would no longer continue 
distributing free baseball hats 
— marketed as “CAPS Caps” 
— to attendees of the counsel-
ing session program. 
A department of the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs, CAPS 
?rst began the program last 
October after an extensive 
survey of the campus com-
munity. “We held town halls, 
emailed polls to students, and 
met with student leaders to 
hear everyone’s concerns,” 
said Joy McKenna, an assis-
tant dean of Student Affairs.
“Dif?culties adjusting to 
college life, sleep deprivation, 
poor mental health and well-
being, and academic stress 
are prevalent at Carnegie 
Mellon,” McKenna said. “All 
of this contributes to why we 
frequently appear on many 
‘Most Stressful Colleges’ lists. 
Seriously, Google it.”
After some deliberation, 
McKenna said that they then 
decided how to address the 
needs of the student body. 
“Being aware of the stress 
culture and various issues 
that the university has, we’ve 
realized that the single most 
effective way to improve the 
quality of life at CMU is to give 
students free stuff,” McKenna 
said.
Students can recount how 
this policy has affected their 
time at Carnegie Mellon.
“I remember the ‘Thanks 
Bill’ cups and blankets, the 
free burritos, the T-shirts 
we got during Homecoming 
weekend,” said junior com-
puter science and electrical 
and computer engineering 
double major Vinitha Chopra.
“Every time I’ve ever 
stressed out about midterms 
or my kernel not working or 
any social things I was going 
through, I always felt that 
the university was there with 
outstretched arms,” Chopra 
said, “and in those arms were 
Hacky Sacks that say ‘Carn-
egie Mellon University’ on 
them.”
However, the lack of en-
thusiasm surrounding CAPS 
Caps has lead to the sudden 
cancellation of the program.
“It’s surprising to me how 
CAPS Caps haven’t made the 
impact that we expected them 
to,” McKenna said. “Whether 
it’s the ‘survival kits’ of knock-
off cheap plastic Ray Bans and 
a few bite-sized Twix bars, or 
the free pieces of cake to cel-
ebrate Andrew Carnegie’s 
179th birthday, we’ve always 
been devoted to meeting our 
students’ lasting material 
needs.”
While this program may 
be ending, McKenna is hope-
ful that other initiatives that 
address the students’ lack of 
school-branded bumper stick-
ers will be more effective.
“We are honored to have 
the world’s best and brightest 
on this campus, and our job at 
Student Affairs isn’t over un-
til every student is satis?ed,” 
McKenna said, “with their 
CMU mousepads.”

that the single

life at CMU is to

Pres. Suresh refuses to make of?ce calls without his hamburger phone
BRENT HEARD
Would never barf in your 
urn, Brenda
University President, 
former dean of engineer-
ing at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, 
member of the National In-
stitute of Medicine, the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, 
the National Academy of 
Engineering, and former 
National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) director Subra 
Suresh is refusing to make 
phone calls until his ham-
burger phone is delivered to 
his office.
The hamburger phone, 
presented to President 
Suresh while serving as the 
director of the NSF, is part 
of the final set of items be-
ing transferred from his old 
office in Washington, D.C. 
As of last Thursday, Presi-
dent Suresh confirmed that 
the phone was still being 
shipped.
“The hamburger phone 
is a staple of intelligent 
pop culture and I just can’t 
work without it,” President 
Suresh explained. “I mean, 
who doesn’t love Juno?” he 
continued, gazing absently 
at the Neutral Milk Hotel 
poster hung on the wall 
across from his desk.
“I know everybody is 
on their smartphones now, 
surfing the web and check-
ing their Twitters, but 
there’s a certain authen-
ticity in food-shaped tele-
phones,” President Suresh 
mused further.
Student reactions to-
wards hamburger phones 
were positive. “That’s to-
tally rad,” remarked junior 
lighting design major John-
ny Stevenson.
However, some concern 
was expressed over the 
President’s ability to receive 
his hamburger phone in a 
timely manner. 
President Suresh’s sec-
retary was quoted telling 
Suresh, “That’s one doodle 
that can’t be un-did, home-
skillet,” before offering him 
some Sunny D.
President Suresh ex-
plained that all NSF direc-
tors since Edward A. Knapp 
have been presented with 
a hamburger phone upon 
agreeing to take the posi-
tion. “Some academic so-
cieties have handshakes 
or rings, but I think we re-
ally chose the best option,” 
he said, chuckling as he 
scrolled down his Tumblr 
dashboard. 
“Does anyone want to 
walk over to Starbucks? 
I could really go for a soy 
green tea latte.”
That’s not to say that ev-
ery member of the campus 
community understands the 
President’s affection toward 
his phone. Student vegetar-
ian groups have begun pro-
testing President Suresh’s 
hamburger phone, saying 
that his choice not to have 
a veggie burger phone is un-
acceptable.

Hey readme, it’s The Tar-

Don’t feel awkward 
about, you know. I mean, 
just because I’m not ready 
to say it doesn’t change 
what we have, or what I 
feel about you or whatever. 
I feel that ... I feel that I 
don’t want to say it if I don’t 
really mean it, because that 
wouldn’t be fair to you.
UGGGGHHHH ... I don’t 
know. It’s hard, you know? 
Because it’s not that....
I don’t know. I feel you 
understand. At least, I hope 
you do.
But yea, we should to-

Tomorrow? Um... yea, I

Sushi? I’m actually al-

know, I don’t want to risk 
it... yea, I thought I told you 
about it... hmm.

The Tartan found to be interesting by people who are my mother
A recent survey sent out 
to The Tartan’s reader last 
Thursday revealed that my 
mother ?nds Carnegie Mel-
lon’s student newspaper 
“very informative” and “so 
well written, honey.”
“This is really great news 
for The Tartan’s future 
growth and viability,” said 
Braden Kelner, junior profes-
sional writing and creative 
writing double major and 
Editor-in-Chief of The Tar-
tan. “We’re always looking 
for feedback from our reader, 
and the fact that Mrs. Smith 
has taken the time to get back 
to us will help us better serve 
her Carnegie Mellon news 
needs.”
Despite this optimism, 
there have been some con-
cerns that the survey data 
may be inconclusive.
“I really like that one ar-
ticle you wrote for that lec-
ture thing you went to,” my 
mom said, “but to be honest, 
I only read The Tartan every 
week to make sure you’re not 
dead. You should really call 
home more often, Josh. How 
are your classes going? I got

Campus unites in candlelight vigil for missing ‘Walking to the Sky’ child
LULA BERESFORD
Dreams about having super 
strong pecs
Over 200 members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
gathered for an evening of 
candlelight and remembrance 
underneath the Walking to 
the Sky sculpture last Thurs-
day. The event was held in 
honor of the young boy whose 
disappearance from the stat-
ue’s base during the fall se-
mester traumatized students 
and faculty.
“We hope that tonight ev-
eryone can begin their heal-
ing process,” said vigil coor-
dinator, senior biology major 
Martha Berns, who spoke at 
the beginning of the evening. 
“Though we will always hope 
that our sky child Lloyd will 
return to us, it is important for 
us to acknowledge that we are 
powerless in this situation and 
can only hope and desire to 
see him standing here again.”
After Berns spoke, students 
and faculty linked arms to sing 
a rendition of the well-known 
Led Zeppelin tune “Stairway 
to Heaven” as wreaths were 
placed around the necks of 
the remaining Walking to the 
Sky members. Ron Krystewes-
ki-Potts, sophomore musical 
theatre major, clambered up 
the statue in order to reach 
those at the top. Vigil par-
ticipants were then asked to 
remain silent for 38 minutes 
while slowly circling the stat-
ue in concentric circles.
The event continued with-
out a hitch until about 25 min-
utes into the silence, when 
the sky broke and those at 
the vigil became the victims 
of a torrential downpour. 
The downpour extinguished 
the candles, leaving those at-
tending the vigil in darkness 
for the last 13 minutes of the 
walk. 
“It was weird and cold,” 
Krysteweski-Potts said, “But I 
de?nitely felt a sort of candle 
inside me.” The participants 
dispersed at around 11 p.m., 
and drenched students and 
faculty were asked to leave 
the Cut.
Though Carnegie Mellon 
has taken the initiative to give 
the campus community some 
closure regarding this horri?c 
event, there is still wide spec-
ulation as to how and why the 
boy disappeared in the ?rst 
place. “Perhaps he had some 
sort of premonition of the 
harshness of this winter, and 
escaped before the worst of it 
arrived. Lloyd is a delicate boy, 
and if this is the case, none of 
us can really blame him for it,” 
said English professor Angela 
Murkton.
First-year computer sci-
ence major Bruce Henry Wal-
lace disagreed. “I de?nitely 
think that he lost his hand in 
what could only have been a 
knife ?ght, and that whoever 
that knife ?ght was with came 
and ?nished him off.”
Still others cite university 
conspiracy. “I think that there 
is de?nite cover-up going on 
by the University here. Maybe 
Lloyd had discovered the orig-
inal blueprints for Wean Hall 
or something and the univer-
sity had to rid itself of him,” 
said Gretchen Low, an unde-
clared ?rst-year student in the 
Dietrich College of Humani-
ties & Social Sciences.
Regardless of the confu-
sion surrounding Lloyd’s 
disappearance, the entire 
campus stands with his fa-
ther and the rest of the statue 
in solidarity, according to 
Berns, who said in closing, 
“I think more than anything, 
this vigil shows our campus 
unity and our compassion for 
people whether they be ?esh 
and blood or representations. 
That, my friends, is a beautiful 
thing.”
Entrepreneurship class project turns into largest crystal meth ring in state
BRENT HEARD
Made the mistake of starting 
Breaking Bad during ?nals 
week
The Tepper School of Busi-
ness undergraduate course 
Intro to Entrepreneurship has 
reached levels of success be-
yond what anyone could have 
expected since students start-
ed pushing a unique product 
line: crystal meth.
According to local critics 
and a?cionados, the meth-
amphetamine produced by 
the class is some of the purest 
they’ve seen on the streets, 
and also has a distinctive char-
acteristic: its sky-blue color.
“Well, one of the ?rst things 
the professor told us about 
starting your own business is 
that it’s all in the marketing,” 
said sophomore materials sci-
ence and engineering major 
Brock Cantillo. “Altering our 
cook so we get this blue color 
has really paid off.”
The students enrolled in 
the course reported that they 
have collectively earned over 
$108 million over the course 
of the semester.
The class started small, 
selling the product as other 
students started their en-
trepreneurship projects in 
the past: tabling in front of 
Doherty Hall. However, as 
their customer base grew, 
their operation needed to ex-
pand.
“We couldn’t afford any of 
these small-time cooks,” ju-
nior business major Angelina 
Samuelson explained, “espe-
cially with ?nals week coming 
up at the end of the semester. 
We knew demand was going 
to be high, so we had to ex-
pand fast.”
The class members up-
graded their operation and 
expanded from their previ-
ous home in a food truck near 
campus to a lab in one of the 
sub-basements of Doherty 
Hall.
“We really owe our success 
to the professor,” Cantillo con-
tinued. “He taught us how the 
stuff is made, told us tips for 
selling and distribution, gave 
advice on our image like what 
kind of hat to wear when con-
ducting business meetings, 
and is just a great motivator.”
“Some students were put 
off by his frequent use of some 
profane phrases,” Samuelson 
explained. “But in the end he 
proved himself to be an excel-
lent instructor and de?nitely 
taught us some important les-
sons. He even offered an extra 
review session in the evenings 
on the proper dosing of ricin 
in case our business runs into 
any breakage.”
Given the runaway success 
of their product, the students 
involved in this project have 
all agreed to take a leave of 
absence from Carnegie Mel-
lon to pursue the further 
commercialization of their 
product.
“There’s a lot of money to 
be made,” Cantillo remarked.
Currently in his ?rst se-
mester teaching at Carnegie 
Mellon, Prof. Pinkman is an 
adjunct faculty member at the 
Tepper School of Business.

NSA recruiters greet career fair attendees by name
BRANDON SCHMUCK
I’ve got this feeling, 
somebody’s watching me
Besides the expected free 
T-shirts and pens, Carnegie 
Mellon students attending 
the Technical Opportunities 
Conference this year were in 
for an extra surprise. Some 
of the employers, including 
the National Security Agency 
(NSA) in particular, knew 
much more about the po-
tential candidates than the 
candidates knew about the 
companies and organizations 
they were looking to join.
Student expressions were 
a mixture of confusion and 
excitement. “When I walked 
up to the NSA booth, they of-
fered me a mocha latte and 
greeted me by name,” said 
?rst-year information sys-
tems major Brian Huo. “The 
latte was from the café where 
I always Skype my mom.”
“I practiced my eleva-
tor pitch for days, so I con-
?dently approached a NSA 
recruiter,” said sophomore 
computer science major Mel-
anie Thompson. 
“But after a few seconds, 
he cut me off and said, ‘I’m 
sorry Ms. Thompson, but 
those Snapchats you sent to 
Paul at 1:39 a.m. two days 
ago don’t re?ect the level of 
professionalism you claim to 
practice.’ ”
As Thompson left the 
TOC, she said that a friend 
remarked to her that he 
“bombed his chance of get-
ting an internship with the 
NSA,” and shortly afterward 
was tailed by men in dark 
suits. When approached for 
more information, the NSA 
recruiter greeted us by name 
and responded, “Everything 
will be okay. We have neu-
tralized the threat.”
The student in question 
is currently missing, and 
friends are asking for those 
with any knowledge of the 
situation to come forward.
WRCT general manager to step down after accidentally playing Katy Perry on the air
JOSH SMITH
Is ready for, ready for... 
a perfect storm, perfect 
storm...
Junior professional writ-
ing major Amanda Liszewski 
announced on Monday that 
she would step down as gen-
eral manager of WRCT after 
the radio station accidentally 
played the Katy Perry hit sin-
gle “Dark Horse” on the air.
In an embarrassing mo-
ment, the Carnegie Mellon 
radio station aired the song 
last Friday that ?rst-year biol-
ogy major Joseph Jiang called 
“catchy,” and that sophomore 
decision science major Sarah 
Masterson referred to as “on 
my jogging playlist.”
In her resignation speech, 
Liszewski stated that “De-
spite this egregious error, 
WRCT has always strived to 
alienate itself from the more 
mainstream musical tastes of 
CMU.”
“I hope that the station 
will rebuild and maintain the 
community’s apathy in the 
near future,” she said.
Sophomore design major 
and acting general manager 
Giuseppe DiDonato said that 
WRCT promises a renewed 
commitment to only play 
music that consists of quasi-
tribal witch house vocals 
over basslines inspired by 
the 1989-era ska-in?uenced 
suburban Duluth neo-synth 
chillwave scene with beat 
samples of someone shaking 
an Etch-a-Sketch.
Professor forgets to show up to lecture, nobody notices
BRENT HEARD
Has never been bored in a 
math class
Tenured university profes-
sor Herbert A. Schuber forgot 
to show up to lecture for the 
course Differential Equations 
that he is teaching this se-
mester, but despite their pro-
fessor’s absence, the 80 stu-
dents enrolled in the course 
took their seats in Wean 7500 
and promptly found ways to 
hide their smartphones un-
der their notebooks.
The 50 minutes passed 
uneventfully as usual, as 
students liked thousands of 
Facebook posts and retweet-
ed over 500 tweets. A dozen 
or so of the students drifted 
in and out of consciousness 
as they napped, and others 
stared at the ceiling in bore-
dom, thinking about how 
much money they’ll make af-
ter graduation. 
In the meantime, Schuber 
hummed contentedly as he 
drew on the whiteboard in 
his of?ce, working on his re-
search for his upcoming pub-
lication.
While Schuber was dili-
gently deriving an identity 
for future publication, stu-
dents also pursued their own 
passions and accomplish-
ments. They reached new 
high scores on Flappy Bird, 
Candy Crush, and Angry 
Birds and have found new as-
pects of themselves through a 
number of BuzzFeed quizzes.
“Ugh, boring as usual,” 
sophomore statistics major 
Angela Tanken responded 
when asked about the lec-
ture, closing the tab contain-
ing her results for the “What 
kind of potato are you?” quiz. 
“I can never understand the 
content.”
When asked about the 
class, junior biology major 
Timothy Keen lied through 
his teeth, saying, “Professor 
Schuber is very knowledge-
able, and I appreciate hav-
ing class with a professor as 
distinguished in his ?eld as 
he is.”
At 5:30 p.m. — as most 
students and professors 
headed back to their respec-
tive homes — no one had 
realized the professor’s ab-
sence. Internal university sta-
tistics show this occurrence 
happens an average of three 
times per semester.

Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby 
has stirred up controversy, 
this time after a student par-
ticipant performed in the pa-
rade dressed as the famous 
astrophysicist Carl Sagan, but 
nude from the waist down.
The student in question, 
sophomore art major Gillian 
McNeill, donned the late sci-
entist’s trademark turtleneck 
sweater and beige jacket, but 
was otherwise naked with her 
pubic area shaped to resemble 
the parody deity known as the 
Flying Spaghetti Monster.
“At least, I think it was the 
Flying Spaghetti Monster,” 
said Downhill Derby specta-
tor and junior chemical engi-
neering major Cody Phillips. 
“She just might not do much 
in terms of maintenance down 
there.”
Following the event, the 
university received a formal 
complaint from the Carnegie 
Mellon branch of the secular-
ist group Atheists, Humanists, 
and Agnostics (AHA).
“I’m upset because I think 
what happened here is really 
not just an insult to us as free-
thinkers,” said senior statis-
tics major and AHA president 
Dylan Ziegel, “but it was an 
insult to billions and billions 
of systems of belief, and it 
was an insult to who we are as 
American citizens.”
University President Subra 
Suresh responded to the com-
plaint and the controversy 
surrounding “Carl Sagan Girl” 
with an email to the campus 
community, stating, “We re-
spect our students’ right to 
freedom of speech and expres-
sion, no matter how contro-
versial those views are. How-
ever, we must implore every 
Carnegie Mellon student who 
isn’t on the crew team to re-
main as clothed as possible.”Josh Smith/Thinks they’re doing a really good job with Cosmos
Wean Hall upset it has no matches on OkCupid
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Knows there’s plenty of ?sh
Last weekend, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Wean Hall took a 
courageous leap into the ro-
mantic unknown and joined 
the prominent online dating 
service OkCupid.
When questioned about 
its motives in creating an Ok-
Cupid account, Wean stared 
stoically out over the Mall.
“It’s not like I was taking it 
seriously,” Wean said, expres-
sion unyielding as concrete. 
“It was just a whim, man. 
Don’t you get lonely some-
times?”
Despite Wean’s insistence 
that its turn to online ro-
mance was a casual decision, 
its OkCupid pro?le reveals 
detailed responses to que-
ries such as “Have you ever 
felt imprisoned?” and “What 
makes you rock hard?” In 
addition, Wean’s pro?le pic-
ture features the facility at a 
carefully ?ltered side angle, 
presumably intended to be 
?attering.
Although Wean started 
off with high hopes for over-
coming its sense of crippling 
inferiority, the unfortunate 
Carnegie Mellon landmark 
has been met with little suc-
cess in its search for Internet 
love.
Since joining the service, 
Wean estimates that it has 
attempted to contact “like, 
all of the buildings within 
Pittsburgh city limits. I even 
looked into a couple of large, 
imposing, and un-enterable 
structures.”
However, Wean has not 
received a single reply to its 
746 private messages sent 
via OkCupid, nor has it been 
matched up with any one of 
the service’s several thou-
sand users, even other ugly 
buildings in Pittsburgh.
Wean did mention one 
notable communication be-
tween it and the Gates Hill-
man Complex.
“I was really nervous mes-
saging it,” Wean revealed. “I 
knew that Gates was majorly 
out of my league, but I de-
luded myself into thinking it 
wouldn’t matter. I mean, we 
have so much in common. 
Hipster cafés, kidnapping 
computer science majors.…”
The Gates Hillman Com-
plex, which came into its own 
in 2009, responded eloquent-
ly to Wean’s advances.
“Seriously, you’re like 40,” 
Gates wrote. “Ew.”
When asked whether it 
intended to keep fruitlessly 
trying, Wean answered with 
a scoff.
“What’s the point? All any-
one cares about nowadays 
is ?oor-to-ceiling glass pan-
els and ?ashy exterior light 
shows. No one ever bothers 
to look inside.”
As for Wean’s romantic 
future, Scaife Hall has ex-
pressed interest where others 
have not.
“Wean may not be the 
most glamorous,” said Scaife, 
“But it has this nice sturdy, 
dependable quality to it. 
Like it could support a lot of 
weight, protect you from the 
end of the world.”
Upon being informed of 
Scaife’s statement, Wean 
only returned to stony-faced 
indifference.
“Sorry,” Wean said, “I’m 
not into Pringles.”
When asked to comment 
on the romantic misadven-
tures of Wean Hall in connec-
tion with Gates and Scaife, 
senior philosophy major Jon-
athon Frankel was inexplica-
bly confused.
“How high am I?” said 
Frankel, in a statement, “How 
high are you?”
Booth Committee announces last-minute Carnival theme change to ‘F*** It, Build Whatever You Want’
JOSH SMITH
Has never built a booth, but 
somehow has three Booth 
construction hats
Just under two weeks 
away from the annual Carn-
egie Mellon celebration, the 
Spring Carnival Committee 
announced yesterday that 
they are changing the theme 
for this year’s booth building 
competition from “Best of the 
Best” to “F*** It, Build What-
ever You Want.”
An exasperated Linda 
Yuan, a senior mechanical en-
gineering major and head of 
Booth, announced the theme 
change via Facebook and 
Twitter.
“You know, it’s ?ne, what-
ever,” Yuan said. “We always 
try to pick a theme that’s dif-
ferent and interesting, but a 
bunch of the orgs are going 
to just completely ignore it 
and build Rugrats, Toy Story, 
and Power Ranger-themed 
booths.”
“So while we originally 
went with ‘Best of the Best’ for 
this year’s Booth competition, 
we said ‘screw it, you’re not 
going to pay attention to the 
theme anyway,’ ” Yuan said.
Student reaction to the 
theme change has been 
mixed. Sophomore electrical 
and computer engineering 
major Vinay Chahal thinks the 
theme change will be better 
for the booth-building 
process.
“I’ve been involved with 
Booth for the past two years 
with SigEp,” Chahal said. 
“Last year, with the theme 
‘Fractured Fairytales,’ the fra-
ternity made a collective de-
cision to say ‘F*** it, let’s do 
an Up booth.’ Now with the 
theme change, we don’t even 
have to pretend to adhere to 
some theme. Lord of the Rings 
it is.”
Other students, such as ju-
nior design major Samantha 
Brennan, feel that the change 
isn’t in the spirit of Carnival.
“I understand why they 
made that choice, but I think 
it’s shirking tradition,” Bren-
nan said. 
“It’s important to the Booth 
experience for students to cre-
ate really fun, intricate, nos-
talgia-inducing booths that 
?agrantly ignore whatever 
theme the Booth Committee 
came up with.”
Despite the concerns, Yuan 
feels that it’s a positive move 
for this year’s Carnival.
“At this point, we just don’t 
give a s***,” Yuan said, look-
ing tired and defeated. 
“People are going to be 
too drunk to remember the 
theme. It’s so pointless, 
really ... so pointless.”

Carnegie Mellon to accept ?rst ugly student into the School of Drama
LULA BERESFORD
Professional raisin. 
Entrepreneur.
In a recent effort to in-
crease diversity, the Of?ce of 
Undergraduate Admission 
announced on Thursday that 
Carnegie Mellon School of 
Drama has decided to accept 
a truly ugly candidate for the 
?rst time. Edgar Marsden, 
nephew of actor James Mars-
den and the ?rst ugly student 
ever accepted, received his 
decision last week with the 
rest of the regular-decision 
applicants.
“I approached the drama 
department two years ago 
about the issue of diversity,” 
said senior drama major Tiffa-
ny Green. “They had asked me 
earlier in the semester to use 
makeup to dis?gure my nose 
for an upcoming production. 
That seemed fake to me, and it 
got me thinking. I feel like you 
need ugly people in theater to 
keep authenticity alive.”
It has taken Green a while 
to convince university of?cials 
to take steps toward promot-
ing diversity in the College of 
Fine Arts, and in the School 
of Drama in particular. How-
ever, her efforts did catalyze 
the creation of the Commit-
tee for Diversi?ed Appearance 
(CDA).
This committee attracted 
faculty early on. “I agreed 
with Tiffany all along,” said 
assistant teaching professor 
in vocal performance Ran-
dall Newholm, a member of 
the committee. “CDA was 
founded not only to make sure 
there are different levels of 
attractiveness represented in 
the college’s student body, but 
also to ensure that we maxi-
mize the quality of art here at 
this wonderful university.”
Marsden, a native of 
Belchertown, Mass., was un-
available for comment, but 
Newholm is very con?dent 
that he will decide to attend 
Carnegie Mellon. “This is a 
huge moment for the univer-
sity. His résumé is stupendous 
and he will really free us up to 
put on shows we haven’t been 
able to consider.”
Not only is Marsden “atro-
cious looking,” as Green put it 
after seeing his headshot, but 
he also has a rude and unap-
pealing demeanor as well. 
Green was present for the 
majority of the discussions 
surrounding the decision 
to admit him, and saw and 
heard some of his auditions. 
“He is rude and makes snide 
and inappropriate comments. 
I think that will be an excit-
ing new perspective to bring 
to the School of Drama,” she 
said.
“I know my colleague Es-
meralda Pochenkov has been 
wanting the School of Drama 
to stage The Hunchback of 
Notre Dame for a long time. 
We just haven’t had the re-
sources to stage it because we 
don’t have any ugly students. 
I am so excited that musicals 
like these can ?nally be con-
sidered,” Newholm said. 
Pochenkov, a professor of 
dance, said, “It is miraculous 
the way he moves. Sort of like 
a butter?y, only uglier, much 
uglier, like a small moth. A 
moth with a sort of grace.” 
Apparently Marsden’s act-
ing chops eliminated all the 
competition among other ugly 
applicants for his space. “He 
can really act, and has a rather 
ugly, but appealing voice. He 
blew everyone away,” 
Newholm said. His ugly per-
sonality is exceptionally ver-
satile, as he can develop this 
ugliness in a number of ways: 
“He can be nasty to the point 
of offensive, while still em-
bodying that annoying kid-
next-door kind of character.”
He has also displayed 
strong performances as both 
“sociopaths and petty mon-
sters,” Newhold said. “Even 
though most theater students 
have sociopathic and petty 
monster tendencies.”
“Edgar can really raise the 
level of performance in this 
institution,” Green said. “And 
his acceptance to CMU goes 
against all current admission 
standards across the coun-
try. The School of Drama is a 
pioneer in regard to forward-
thinking admissions.”
Now that the School of 
Drama has accepted its ?rst 
ugly student, the students and 
administration are both excit-
ed to see where Marsden goes.
“It is exciting. I am nervous 
and excited to work with this 
talented boy,” Pochenkov said.
“He is really just awful,” 
Green said. “We are incredibly 
excited and very lucky.”

Following David Tepper’s 
announcement that he will be 
contributing over $67 million 
to Carnegie Mellon, in part to 
?nance the construction of 
the new Tepper Quadrangle, 
the school announced that 
all current and incoming Tep-
per students will forevermore 
have the image of a smiling 
David Tepper branded into 
their chests.
“We just had no other way 
to thank him for his gener-
osity,” said Tepper School 
of Business Dean Damon 
Robertson. “We’ve already 
named the school after him, 
and the costs associated with 
renaming the entire univer-
sity ‘Carnegie Tepper Mellon’ 
were just too high, so this was 
our only reasonable option to 
express our gratitude.”
While many were skepti-
cal of the plan due to a fear of 
student backlash, it appears 
that most Tepper students are 
embracing the decision.
“The man has just done 
so much for our school,” said 
senior business administra-
tion major Alan Grant. “I 
can’t think of any better way 
to thank him than to have to 
wipe his eye when ice cream 
starts to dribble on my stom-
ach when I’m at the beach.”
In reference to Tepper’s 
reputation for using break-
through educative tech-
niques, many supporters have 
been stressing the profession-
al bene?ts that will come with 
the branding.
“A few moments of sear-
ing, agonizing physical pain? 
That’s nothing compared to 
the daily life of an entry-level 
Goldman Sachs intern,” said 
junior ?nance major Anton 
Chigruh. “This is just one step 
toward conditioning my body 
to absorb the effects of such 
reckless levels of needless 
abuse.”
“This will probably look 
good on my résumé, that I can 
dedicate myself so wholly to 
an institution,” said senior ?-
nance major Jennifer Page.
The date of the branding 
of all current Tepper students 
has yet to be announced, but 
Dean Robertson has said that 
it will take place in a special 
ceremony in the basement 
of Posner Hall and will be 
followed by a networking 
reception. Light snacks will 
be served for those in atten-
dance.

2 dead, 1 critical in tragic UC revolving door accident
ANNE-SOPHIE KIM
Never uses doors, never 
leaves her room
Tragedy struck the Univer-
sity Center last Friday after 
two students were killed in a 
freak accident involving one 
of the building’s two revolv-
ing doors.
Junior computer science 
major So?a Girkenstein wit-
nessed the accident. She was 
sitting at the UC black chairs 
when she saw sophomore 
biology major Billy Tomcat 
rushing to his afternoon biol-
ogy lecture.
“He walked into the door 
really fast and this guy fol-
lowed close behind,” Girken-
stein said. “I think he went in 
too fast, because he didn’t get 
out in the ?rst round.”
As Tomcat spun around 
in the revolving door, one of 
his friends, senior philosophy 
major Karl Labelle, report-
edly followed him in. Labelle 
was not moving fast enough 
as he stepped into the door, 
however, and the glass struck 
his head, resulting in a severe 
intracerebral hemorrhage, ac-
cording to CMU EMS. 
Bystanders reported that 
after seeing Labelle’s unfor-
tunate fate, Tomcat tried to 
stop the revolving door. Tom-
cat’s attempt was futile as his 
sweater got caught between 
one of the door’s wings and 
the wall. The door continued 
to rotate, crushing Tomcat’s 
body. CMU EMS declared 
both students dead at the 
scene.
Another unknown individ-
ual was also involved in the 
accident. “There was this man 
who was texting or something 
on his phone,” said ?rst-year 
professional writing major 
Megan Bory, who was work-
ing as a UC desk attendant at 
the time of the accident. 
“He seemed to be in a 
hurry, and I guess he didn’t 
see the crazy stuff happening. 
The door hit him smack in the 
head.”
The unidenti?ed man’s 
face was severely dis?gured 
after being hit by the door. 
He was taken to UPMC by 
ambulance immediately and 
remains in the intensive care 
unit. Police have yet to deter-
mine whether or not the man 
is af?liated with Carnegie 
Mellon.
There will be a candlelight 
vigil for Tomcat and Labelle 
in the UC Kirr Commons this 
Wednesday at 7 p.m. Students 
are advised not to use either 
of the revolving doors to enter 
or leave the ceremony.
Josh Smith/Lost a ?nger in the great revolving door accident of 2011Professor wins Turing Award for turning on classroom projector
JOSH SMITH
Has a spare VGA cable
The Association for Com-
puting Machinery announced 
Wednesday that Carnegie 
Mellon computer science pro-
fessor Bernard Koenig will be 
awarded the prestigious 2014 
Turing Award for discovering 
how to operate the classroom 
projectors.
The award — recognized 
by many as the highest dis-
tinction in the ?eld of com-
puter science — was given to 
Koenig for his report “Manual 
Manipulation of Optical Dis-
play Apparatuses in the Aca-
demic Sector” published last 
spring.
“For years, faculty at this 
institution have sought to 
turn on the classroom projec-
tors, understand why the vol-
ume isn’t working, and learn 
how to get the screen all the 
way down,” School of Com-
puter Science Dean Marjorie 
Yuan said in a press release. 
“Today, thanks to Ber-
nard’s work, it’s now all pos-
sible.”
Koenig feels honored 
by the recognition for his 
achievements.
“I am truly grateful to re-
ceive the Turing Award, but 
none of this would have been 
possible without the tireless 
work of my students and fel-
low faculty members,” Koenig 
said. 
“We would still be at 
square one without their help 
and spare Mac VGA adapters.”
Despite all of his achieve-
ments, Koenig says he has no 
intention of slowing down his 
research pursuits.
“I am currently working 
with a team of highly skilled 
doctoral students to make a 
breakthrough in our under-
standing of how to upload the 
PowerPoint from class yester-
day to Blackboard.”

Febreze partners with CMU to de-stank Gates Center
JOEY PEISER
Is so vain, he probably thinks 
this article is about him
In an announcement 
that brings great relief to a 
large proportion of the Carn-
egie Mellon community, 
air-freshening giant Febreze 
announced that it would be 
partnering with the univer-
sity in order to eradicate the 
body odor-like funk that has 
plagued the Gates Hillman 
Complex.
While the source of the 
stench in the building has yet 
to be de?nitively identi?ed, 
many members of the cam-
pus community theorize that 
its use as the second home 
of many School of Computer 
Science students — known 
for the low priority they give 
to basic rituals of human hy-
giene and societtally accepted 
cleanliness — may play a role 
in the building’s musk.
“I saw a kid in one of the 
clusters in Gates at 6 p.m. on 
a Monday, and when I passed 
the cluster again at 4 a.m. on 
Thursday morning, the same 
kid was there wearing the 
same clothes as on Monday,” 
reported sophomore philoso-
phy major Daniel Fitzgerald.
Details about the scent and 
dispensary methods were not 
provided with the announce-
ment. “We believe our initial 
testings produced estimates 
that severely undercut the 
enormity of the task we have 
at hand,” said a Febreze de-
veloper on the project, who 
wished to remain anonymous 
due to the ongoing research.
While the project is still in 
early development, the com-
pany revealed that it will be 
developing a completely new 
formula in order to combat 
the incredible smell. “If what 
we’re working on now proves 
successful, we may be able to 
look into other applications 
for it,” the developer said. 
“Likely in the industrial sec-
tor; hog fat-rendering plants, 
sulfur mines, and other com-
mercial ventures of that 
nature.”
“If what we’re 
working on 
now proves 
successful, we 
may be able to 
look into other 
applications 
for it ... likely in 
the industrial 
sector.”

Booth to become Habitat for Humanity project next year
Alumni excited to come back for Carnival and tell you how you’re screwing up your student organization
KYLE HENSON
Big supporter of social welfare 
programs
Earlier this week, univer-
sity President Subra Suresh 
revealed his plan to replace 
Carnegie Mellon’s annual 
Booth competition with a 
joint contribution to Habitat 
for Humanity of Greater Pitts-
burgh for future years. “We 
realized that all this money, 
time and effort was being 
wasted on something useless 
and temporary,” Suresh re-
marked. “We decided that it 
was time to direct this incredi-
ble concentration of resources 
towards something that does 
some good in the world and 
lasts more than four days.”
Students expressed mixed 
feelings about the change. 
Junior decision science ma-
jor and SAE Booth chair Tim 
Greenberg said, “I think the 
temporary nature of Booth 
is what makes it a beautiful 
thing. Sure we could con-
tribute to society, but there’s 
just something special about 
tear down. Seeing all that 
hard work vanish in just a 
few hours is such a cathartic 
rush!”
Sophomore architecture 
major Dan Dvorsky was happy 
about the change. “I think it’ll 
provide us architecture ma-
jors a chance to stand out. As 
the hardest working and most 
under appreciated major on 
this campus, I really think this 
change makes Booth our time 
to shine.”
Suresh plans to perpetu-
ate the competitive aspects of 
Booth by giving out awards, 
and continuing with yearly 
themes. After this year’s 
theme change to “F*** It, 
Build Whatever You Want,” 
Sweepstakes plans to con-
tinue with creative, mission-
oriented themes, announcing 
that next year’s houses will be 
Slumdog Millionaire-themed, 
followed by 2016’s, “Mud Huts 
and Straw Roofs.” Awards for 
the new projects will range 
from “Most Homeless People 
Sheltered” to “Least Likely to 
Become A Drug Den.”
Additionally, the of?ce of 
the Pittsburgh Chief of Police 
anticipates a 47 percent drop 
in the rate of homelessness in 
Pittsburgh as a result of this 
new project. 
In a recent press con-
ference, a representative 
of the police department 
commented, “For years, we’ve 
been watching these booths 
get constructed and then im-
mediately get torn down. 
We’re really glad to see some-
one at Carnegie Mellon ?nally 
got some sense knocked into 
their heads.”
Re?ecting on the change, 
Suresh remarked, “I think 
it’s time we acted as smart 
as we claim to be. We can’t 
take ourselves seriously as a 
prestigious research univer-
sity while we waste so many 
resources on something so 
frivolous.”

Looking forward to being a 
cranky alumnus next year
Spring Carnival: As excited 
as students get for the multi-
ple-day celebration, Carnegie 
Mellon’s alumni might look 
forward to it even more. 
For these graduates — 
who have gone on to incred-
ible careers and to pursue all 
that life has to offer — Car-
nival is a chance to return to 
campus, meet up with old 
classmates, and tell the stu-
dents currently running the 
organizations they used to 
belong to how they’re f****** 
everything up.
“It’s so nice to take a few 
days off every year for Carni-
val to see old friends and tell 
the new chair he’s running 
the org into the ground,” said 
Fred Schlosky (MCS ’12), a 
former mechanic for CIA who 
is now an analyst at the De-
partment of Energy. 
“It was the worst possible 
decision to use those wheels 
on Orca.”
With Booth, Buggy, the 
Spring Carnival Concert, and 
numerous other events going 
on, some alumni may have 
trouble trying to ?t in time to 
glare at the leaders of their 
former organizations. How-
ever, other alumni — such as 
former WRCT program direc-
tor Laura Pace (H&SS ’11) — 
are making the time.
“I feel it’s really important 
to make sure I come back, vis-
it my old stomping grounds, 
and judge the s*** out of the 
current directors,” Pace said. 
“There’s just so much institu-
tional knowledge being lost, 
and it’s like they don’t even 
care.”
Even alumni from The 
Tartan are excited to get into 
the Carnival spirit of visiting 
booths, eating funnel cake, 
and giving the cold shoulder 
to current staff members at 
the reunion.
“Some of my best memo-
ries at CMU are from Carni-
val,” said former contributing 
editor Luke Melvin (SCS ’12). 
“It just feels right to hear bag-
pipes playing, watch the bug-
gy races, and tell the editor-
in-chief that the News section 
isn’t what it used to be.”
As with every year, Car-
nival must eventually come 
to a close, as students return 
to focusing on ?nals, alumni 
leave Carnegie Mellon again, 
and the student organizations

LoL teammates realize they’ve slept with each other’s moms
JOSH SMITH
Turret fodder
Two members of the Carn-
egie Mellon eSports League of 
Legends (LoL) team had quite 
the revelation last Monday 
when they discovered that 
they have slept with each oth-
er’s mothers.
The respective trysts came 
to light after sophomore 
chemical engineering major 
Matthew Chen taunted junior 
physics major and teammate 
Simon Weinberg during a 
training match.
“I forget what I said ex-
actly, but his response was 
‘That’s not what your mom 
said last night,’ ” Chen said. 
“It got some laughs from the 
team, but it was unusual how 
he continued, accurately de-
scribing my mom’s hair color, 
eye color, freckles, and the 
scar she got on her left hand 
over summer break while 
picking her azaleas.”
It was at this time, accord-
ing to Weinberg, that Chen 
?red back, insinuating that 
Weinberg’s mother had per-
formed several sexual acts 
with Chen. Chen further 
jabbed at Weinberg, stating 
that he thinks that the new 
throw pillows Mrs. Weinberg 
picked out for the guest bed-
room have a nice Tuscan feel 
to them that really ties the 
room together.
“It was after that we re-
alized that we’ve slept with 
each other’s moms,” Wein-
berg said.
“It is what it is,” said senior 
computer science major and 
team captain Bill Colleran. 
“As long as they can avoid 
Baron’s stacked debuffs and 
Matt gets more practice with 
marksman champions, I don’t 
care who they sleep with.”

Purnell air toxic to non-drama majors
JOSH SMITH
I’m running out of byline ideas
The Purnell Center for the 
Arts was quarantined on Sat-
urday after a student acciden-
tally entered the building and 
was exposed to the high lev-
els of airborne toxins within, 
leaving him in critical 
condition. 
Neither University Police 
nor city police have publicly 
identi?ed the student, al-
though they have released 
some information on the 
victim.
“The student was a fresh-
man male in the Mellon Col-
lege of Science, which may ex-
plain his ignorance toward the 
dangers of non-drama majors 
entering Purnell,” said Uni-
versity Police chief Michael 
Palmieri.
Palmieri further elaborat-
ed that the student may have 
entered the building to see the 
School of Drama production 
of Tennessee Williams’ The 
Glass Menagerie without the 
proper breathing apparatus.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Shelley Loman sent an email 
to the student body after the 
incident. “As most Carnegie 
Mellon students are aware, 
Purnell is restricted to stu-
dents with the appropriate 
oxygen ?ltration masks and 
the certi?ed training to oper-
ate them,” Loman said. 
“Yes, drama majors have 
had more of a gradual expo-
sure to the gaseous poisons in 
Purnell, and have thus been 
immunized to it — the future 
actors and actresses even 
?ourishing from it due to the 
toxins’ side effects of whit-
ened teeth, enhanced muscle 
de?nition, and unnaturally 
abundant self-con?dence. 
But they are the exception,” 
Loman said. “Every other stu-
dent destined to a life of work-
ing in a cubicle and driving a 
Honda Civic should steer clear 
of Purnell unless they have ad-
equate equipment.” 
The Poison Control Cen-
ter of Pittsburgh and various 
government organizations 
have yet to identify what the 
toxin actually is, and are thus 
unable to effectively treat 
victims or remove it from the 
environment. One hypoth-
esis is that the airborne toxin 
is an advanced gaseous form 
of nitrophosphodicarboxylic-
dodecahedrane present from 
a malfunctioning air con-
ditioner somewhere in the 
building. 
Another leading expert 
at the Poison Control Center 
has theorized that the toxin 
is actually an incredibly high 
concentration of hopes and 
dreams of having creative pur-
suits after college, to which 
the average non-drama major 
at Carnegie Mellon has an al-
most immediate negative bio-
logical reaction.

Shadyside ghost unable to haunt girl who spends all of her time at Hunt
GIRI MEHTA
Hunts Haunt... I mean, haunts Hunt
Sophomore English major Salvia Platt has been 
spending most nights working in Hunt Library, much to 
the chagrin of the ghost who haunts her apartment. 
The departed Virginia Dalloway expressed a severe 
anger that Platt has been working every night, saying, 
“It’s my job to make sure the resident in my apartment 
can’t sleep!”
Dalloway has resided at the quaint Shadyside apart-
ment that Platt currently occupies for the last 200 years 
after dying from smog inhalation that was rampant in 
Pittsburgh at the time.
“I opened the window once for fresh air and that 
was that!” joked Dalloway, “More recently it’s been very 
tough roaming around without anyone to haunt. Salvia 
was here for a few nights at ?rst but then something 
about lots of papers drove her to leave!”
Unfortunately, Dalloway is not the ?rst ghost to deal 
with this problem in recent memory. “Much of the ghost 
community in the area around CMU has had trouble 
with students not being accessible in their homes,” 
stated the ghostly spectre of Rick Crimes, local leader of 
support group Ghosts Were People Too. 
“I personally used to appear behind a computer sci-
ence major in the mirror whenever he would brush his 
teeth,” continued Crimes. 
“But I guess only getting two hours of sleep made him 
not care. Sometimes he’d look right at me in the mirror 
with bags under his eyes and I thought he was the one 
that was dead.”

A CulinArt spokesperson 
announced yesterday that 
the campus syndicate would 
add food to its menus some-
time in 2015.
CulinArt spokesperson 
Bob Reinhauser elaborated 
on the reasons for this ad-
dition.  “Cardboard and 
wood dust is no longer an 
economically viable option,” 
Reinhauser said. “Therefore 
we have decided to move 
towards using actual food 
in many of our campus loca-
tions.”
Students familiar with 
the food situation on cam-
pus seemed very upset at this 
new change. 
“My digestive system has 
just gotten used to a high ?-
ber diet and now I’m going

HCII creates ‘virtual hell’ game: Live and study at CMU
ANNE-SOPHIE KIM
For Lent, I just gave up
Over the past two months, 
several students in the Hu-
man-Computer Interaction 
Institute have been building a 
new “virtual hell game” called 
Plaid Nightmare based on stu-
dents’ experiences at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“I was inspired by the 
complaints and suffering on 
campus,” said junior HCI and 
computer science double ma-
jor Jannis Damien, one of the 
programmers. “There are a 
lot of horror games out in the 
market right now, but they’re 
not as emotionally and men-
tally damaging as you would 
think.”
Damien recruited two psy-
chology majors and one cogni-
tive science major, all three of 
whom asked not to be named, 
to gather information on what 
aspects of the Carnegie Mellon 
lifestyle scare students most. 
The team of three worked with 
Damien to develop a one-play-
er game that is custom-tai-
lored to the player. By taking 
a short survey before begin-
ning the game, the system 
creates a series of scenarios 
that the player will ?nd par-
ticularly challenging. Then, 
the player must successfully 
complete each subsequent sce-
nario without having a mental 
breakdown or anxiety attack. 
The game also adapts to the 
choices and actions that the 
player takes throughout the 
game to ensure that the player 
experiences maximum 
suffering.
“You choose a major or 
two, maybe a minor, check off 
what you like or dislike, and 
the game sets up a plan for 
you to graduate. The goal is to 
graduate — graduate and you 
win, fail and you, well, fail,” 
Damien said.
Damien also worked with 
junior computer science ma-
jor Humphrey Chung and se-
nior computer science and art 
double major Eunice Dunst to 
make the graphics and overall 
experience as clean and realis-
tic as possible. “We wanted it 
to seem like the player is actu-
ally experiencing their night-
mare,” Chung said. “This isn’t 
just some lame Amnesia spin-
off 112 project; it’s the real 
deal.”
The team developed a de-
vice inspired by the Oculus 
Rift, a virtual reality head-
mounted display developed by 
Oculus VR, as a platform for 
the game. They invited several 
students to test the game last 
week.
“It was crazy. One minute 
I was getting ready for bed, 
the next I was suffering from 
food poisoning from the Un-
derground and also being told 
that I had to study another 
year,” said ?fth-year architec-
ture major Laura Gulliver. “It 
really felt like hell.”
There were some issues 
with the trial, however. Ju-
nior professional and creative 
writing double major Tobias 
Bowers experienced a glitch in 
the game, whereupon he was 
suddenly attacked by a mob of 
creative writing majors wield-
ing My Little Pony merchan-
dise as weapons. “I’d rather 
not talk about it,” Bowers said.
Plaid Nightmare is expected 
to be released by late 2015, 
pending the game being shut 
down by admissions of?cers.

The game, Plaid Nightmare, draws upon the experiences and suffering of Carnegie Mellon students, and has been described as “eerily realistic.”

WORD SEARCH, BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE ONE THING OUR GRANDPARENTS ENJOY IN THIS ISSUE
Bragging about unit count increases respect from peers
JOSH SMITH
Seriously, I can’t think of 
another byline
A new study by Carnegie 
Mellon’s psychology depart-
ment reveals that students 
who brag about how many 
units they are taking are more 
likely to be deeply respected 
by their peers.
Melanie Kerr, an associate 
teaching professor with the 
department, published the 
results of her team’s two-year-
long study last week.
“Through our research, 
we found that students who 
often steer conversations so 
that they have the opportunity 
to complain about how little 
sleep they are getting are per-
ceived in highly favorable ways 
by fellow students,” Kerr said. 
“It’s important to note that the 
student not only needs to have 
an absurdly heavy workload in 
a major respected by members 
of the university, but more im-
portantly, they must also talk 
incessantly about how much 
they hate themselves for over-
loading on courses.”
In addition to receiving the 
admiration of their friends 
and acquaintances, according 
to Kerr, such students are also 
found to be signi?cantly more 
sexually attractive by mem-
bers of the student body.
“When a student adds a 
course to his or her schedule 
on SIO, the course is displayed 
onscreen with a unique color,” 
Kerr said. “The more courses 
a student takes, the larger the 
variety of colors on the sched-
ule. We speculate that since 
the student is going to show 
people their schedule without 
being asked, that — much like 
the plumage of a peacock — 
these colors will aid the over-
achiever in attracting a poten-
tial mate.”
Kerr hopes that by analyz-
ing the data of this study fur-
ther, the department will one 
day be able to fully realize the 
extent to which self-worth 
and academic masochism are 
intertwined in the psyche of 
Carnegie Mellon students.
“Through our 
research, we 
found that 
students who ... 
complain about 
how little sleep 
they are getting 
are perceived in 
highly favorable 
ways.”

psychology

Intel and CMU work together on IDeATe
ALVIN MATHEW
Staffwriter
As he sat in his of?ce on 
the lower level of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Margaret Morrison 
Hall, Daragh Byrne’s excite-
ment over the IDeATe pro-
gram was evident. 
Byrne, currently a re-
search scientist in the Visible 
Process Lab at the School of 
Design and former assistant 
research professor at Arizo-
na State University’s School 
of Arts, Media, and Engi-
neering, has been tabbed as 
the Intel integrative design 
fellow for the university. He 
will be coordinating with 
faculty on the program and 
leading research on optimal 
methods for integrative de-
sign education, as well as on 
ways in which Intel products 
can be utilized for innova-
tive, collaborative efforts.
Sponsored by Intel, the 
Integrative Design, Arts, 
and Technology (IDeATe) 
program is about combin-
ing “technical expertise with 
design expertise to create 
a next-generation learning 
environment for students,” 
Byrne explained. 
Carnegie Mellon, the ?fth 
school to join the new Intel 
Design School Network, is 
the ?rst to announce a pro-
gram combining integrative 
design and technological 
skills for students from a di-
verse array of majors.
The IDeATe program is 
meant to support students 
looking at careers in media 
design, game design, and 
more. To Byrne, the part-
nership is about “exploring 
next-generation learning en-
vironments where students 
are supported by new and 
innovative technologies.” 
As part of IDeATe, Intel 
is giving hardware and ma-
terials to the university, in-
cluding tablets, laptops, and 
Galileo development boards, 
which will be available to 
students, designers, and fac-
ulty who are participating in 
the curriculum.
“The idea is that we now 
have a large amount of 
hardware that will give us 
a new chance to explore,” 
Byrne said. “It’s a fantastic 
opportunity. With the sup-
port of the university and 
of Intel, we can explore how 
to enhance their integrative 
design experiences on cam-
pus.” 
Participation in the 
Intel Design School Network 
1000plus gives opportunities for service
GEORGE LEDERMAN
Junior Staffwriter
At 9 a.m. on Saturday 
morning, a crew of people 
wearing orange re?ective 
vests could be seen sweeping 
Craig Street. 
These workers had not 
been sentenced to community 
service, nor were they being 
paid for their labor — it was a 
group of Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents taking part in 1000plus.
The Craig Street team was 
led by M. Shernell Smith, as-
sistant director within the of-
?ce of the dean of student af-
fairs. “I’ve always thought it’s 
great for CMU to get out en 
masse,” said Smith. “People 
tend to get bogged down with-
in the bubble.” Smith couldn’t 
talk long before a new volun-
teer arrived; she rushed over 
to give the volunteer a shovel.

Student government candidates discuss platforms in debates
BRENT HEARD

JOEY PEISER
Pillbox Editor
With elections now open 
for Student Senate positions, 
including student body presi-
dent (SBP), student body vice 
president (SBVP), student 
body vice president for ?nance 
(SBVPF), student body vice 
president for organizations 
(SBVPO), and more, the can-
didates for the four major po-
sitions participated in debates 
last week.
Approximately 40 people 
attended Tuesday’s SBP and 
SBVP debate in Rangos 2. The 
event was also live streamed 
online by cmuTV.
During the debate, each set 
of candidates had three min-
utes to make an opening state-
ment, after which there was 
a question and answer for-
mat — the moderator posed 
a question and the candidates 
responded. The candidates re-
ceived 30 seconds to respond 
to their opponents after each 
question. The event ended 
with closing remarks from 
both sets of candidates.
Running on one ticket are 
junior electrical and comput-
er engineering and business 
administration double major 
Ian Glasner (for SBP) and ju-
nior biological sciences ma-
jor Shalini Ray (for SBVP). In 
their platform, they focus on 
improving student life, with 
initiatives such as restructur-
ing dining plans, improving 
campus unity, restructuring 
Faculty Course Evaluations 
(FCEs), and reforming dorm 
alcohol policies.
The other ticket is com-
prised of junior chemistry 
major Dominic Akerele (for 
SBP) and junior electrical and 
computer engineering major 
Rohan Saigal (for SBVP). In 
their platform, they focus on 
increasing student engage-
ment, improving the campus 
printing system, improving 
students’ health, and creat-
ing a campus homepage for 
students with a link to Black-
board and information about 
extracurricular activities oc-
curring around campus.
In his opening statement, 
Akerele called for greater 
support for the student body, 
encouraging a less stressful 
campus culture and better 
faculty-student relationships. 
Saigal summarized their 
goals, saying, “It’s our job as 
a student government to help 
facilitate and make everyday 
life better and distract from 
this academic stress.”
Akerele continued his re-
marks, stating, “We would like 
to highlight our student body.” 
He added, “This is supposed to 
be the best four years of your 
life; ?ve if you’re an archie.”
Glasner framed his can-
didacy in terms of improving 
student representation and 
participation in student gov-
ernment: “I want to give stu-
dents a chance to represent 
themselves.”
Glasner dismissed candi-
dates’ platforms for building 
school spirit in previous years 
as “pep rallies,” adding that he 
and Ray had been in student 
government for all three years 
of their time at Carnegie Mel-
lon. He went on to say, “We 
actually have a plan of attack.”
Akerele and Saigal want to 
create a spirit week in the fall, 
which would culminate in a 
day off for students. Saigal ex-
plained, “Carnival is only two 
to four days out of the year; 
we want to have a lot of events 
that the campus can get excit-
ed about.” He also said that he 
would push for greater support 
of athletic events in student 
culture, stating that he wished 
the atmosphere of Carnegie 
Mellon football games would 
be akin to the atmosphere at 
Ohio State University.
In response to an audience 
question about the feasibil-
ity of obtaining a day off from 
classes in the fall, Akerele re-
sponded, “We haven’t really 
gone through any of the spe-
ci?c details.”
“We want students to 
be proud of where we go 
to school,” Akerele contin-
ued, describing the “Hump 
Day Hangouts” initiative in 
their platform where “Every 
Wednesday we’d hand out 
free, healthy snacks.”
Glasner agreed that Carn-
egie Mellon school spirit is 
“de?nitely on the weaker 
side,” but portrayed the lack 
of sports and football excite-
ment in a more positive light. 
Students who come to Carn-
egie Mellon may value these 
traits, he said. In terms of 
building spirit, Glasner said, 
“We can do more for juniors 
and sophomores to give them 
more speci?c events,” noting 
that there are a multitude of 
?rst-year and senior-oriented 
events, but very few targeting 
students in their second and 
third years.
Glasner also spoke about 
improving the dining system 
on campus. Glasner wishes to 
alter the cost structure of meal 
plans so that upperclassmen 
are incentivized to keep meal 
plans. “Dining is something 
I’m really passionate about at 
this school,” he said, recalling 
a meeting he had with Vice 
President for Campus Affairs 
Michael Murphy, who did 
not believe that a block could 
cost over nine dollars on some 
meal plans. Glasner recalled 
doing the math in front of 
Murphy to prove his point.
In their platform, Glasner 
and Ray describe an initiative 
for the creation of blocks that 
are more desirable to upper-
classmen. These block could 
come without a side or bever-
age, Glasner said during the 
debate.
During the response peri-
od, Saigal countered their plan 
by saying that meal blocks are 
not healthy and that “we want 
to take the initiative to allo-
cate the budget to free food,” 
namely healthy food.
Saigal said, “I’ve heard over 
a hundred complaints … we 
need to ?x Skibo Gym.” Aker-
ele and Saigal want to allocate 
money for the improvement of 
athletic facilities to improve 
student motivation to use the 
gyms.
Akerele also spoke of their 
desire to get new university 
printers at the Intersection 
housing cluster and off-cam-
pus housing locations, such 
as Webster Hall and Fairfax 
Apartments. “It would be good 
to have another printing sys-
tem in the UC,” he added.
Ray criticized Akerele’s 
idea, saying, “You would de?-
nitely need a lot more help 
than just from computing 
services.”
Junior information systems 
major and Joint Funding Com-
mittee (JFC) representative 
Andrew Schwartz questioned 
the feasibility of the printer 
purchases during the audi-
ence question period, saying, 
“Student body presidents 
are usually given between 
?ve and six thousand dol-
lars for the year.” He contin-
ued, “a lot of these printers 
cost between ten and twelve 
thousand dollars.” Schwartz 
mentioned that student gov-
ernment recently installed a 
new printer for the university. 
The printer had to be rented 
to make it affordable, accord-
ing to Schwartz. He also also 
mentioned that the budget for 
food would likely be $3,000 
to $4,000, which would limit 
free food initiatives.
Glasner also proposed 
changes in the university’s 
underage drinking policy, in-
cluding a process for internal 
citations and discipline, in 
Braden Kelner/Editor-in-Chief
The four candidates running for the SBP and SBVP tickets debated campus issues, ranging from underage drinking discipline to school spirit, on Tuesday in the University Center’s Rangos 2.

University administra-
tion announced in a campus-
wide email last Monday that 
the University Center (UC), 
which is set to be expand-
ed and renovated over the 
course of the next two years, 
will be named after Jared Co-
hon, president emeritus and 
professor of civil and environ-
mental engineering and engi-
neering and public policy.
According to the email, 
the new name for the UC 
comes from a resolution of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Board of 
Trustees. The naming contin-
ues a long tradition of Carn-
egie Mellon buildings taking 
the names of former univer-
sity presidents.
“In keeping with CMU’s 
tradition of naming buildings 
for past presidents, the Uni-
versity Center will be named 
in recognition of Dr. Cohon’s 
many contributions to the 
success of the university, its 
students, faculty, and staff 
during his 16 years as presi-
dent,” the email said.
The email continued, “As 
the center of campus life, 
the Cohon University Center 
will be an enduring and ?t-
ting tribute to Dr. Cohon’s ex-
traordinary personal engage-
ment with students and his 
leadership style that focused 
on bringing diverse groups of 
people together to create bet-
ter outcomes for all.”
The expanded UC, which 
is set to be completed in fall 
2016, will include new ?tness 
and recreation spaces for stu-
dents, as well as a new studio 
theater and space for student 
organizations.
Cohon served as Carn-
egie Mellon’s president from 
1997–2013, before which he 
served as dean of the School 
of Forestry & Environmen-
tal Studies at Yale University 
and assistant and associate 
dean of engineering and vice 
provost for research at Johns 
Hopkins University. Cohon 
was also named the director 
of the nascent Wilton E. Scott 
Institute for Energy Innova-
tion in February after retiring 
as president in June 2013.

Carlow University launches CREATE Lab
Carlow University, an in-
stitution based in Pittsburgh, 
received a $205,000 grant 
from the Claude Worthing-
ton Benedum Foundation to 
create a satellite lab of Carn-
egie Mellon’s Community 
Robotics, Education, and 
Technology Empowerment 
(CREATE) Lab.
“We believe having a 
CREATE Lab satellite at the 
Campus School will bene?t 
The Campus School [of Car-
low University] students and 
faculty, and also Carlow’s 
School of Education faculty 
and students,” said Suzanne 
Mellon, Carlow University’s 
president, in a university 
press release. “We thank the 
Benedum Foundation for 
recognizing the potential in 
this unique opportunity for 
both students and faculty to 
learn and excel.”
According to a university 
press release, Carlow will 
join West Virginia’s “Mar-
shall University, West Vir-
ginia University, and West 
Liberty University in estab-
lishing CREATE Lab satel-
lites.” The press release also 
states that “Collaboration 
and sustained involvement 
with the community are sig-
ni?cant components of the 
mission of the CREATE Lab, 
which is both a technology 
breeding ground and a com-
munity partner.”
Carlow’s School of Educa-
tion and The Campus School 
of Carlow University are set 
to collaborate on the project. 
While The Campus School 
will establish two projects, 
Arts & Bots and GigaPan, the 
School of Education is set to 
lead the Children’s Innova-
tion Project.
In a statement on the 
press release, Dror Yaron, 
the outreach director of the 
lab, said, “The CREATE Lab 
is pleased to partner with 
Carlow to help future teach-
ers prepare their students 
to become technologically 
?uent. The next generation 
of students should look at 
technology as a raw mate-
rial — something that can be 
used to achieve community 
and/or personal goals. We 
envision the four schools of 
education — three in West 
Virginia and Carlow — in 
partnership with CREATE 
Lab and ASSET STEM Edu-
cation, to work together as a 
network to develop, validate, 
and share best practices. 
That has already begun to 
happen.”
The CREATE Lab is di-
rected by Illah Nourbaksh, 
professor of robotics at Carn-
egie Mellon.

Senate allocated $40,000 
to WRCT. Senate initially ap-
proved a motion to allocate 
$23,300 to WRCT, but an 
amendment was passed to 
raise the funding to $40,000. 
This funding comes from the 
media fee reserve account, 
which holds the yearly over-
?ow from the unread news-
papers provided by the Col-
legiate Readership Program, 
which is funded by the media 
fee, a $10 fee included in stu-
dents’ tuition. Last year, Senate 
set a precedent by allocating 
$65,000 from the media fee 
reserve account for Activities 
Board: Films to purchase a new 
digital 4K projector.
The allocated money will 
be used by WRCT to buy the 
equipment needed to upgrade 
their studio to include digital 
appliances over the course of 
the summer and upcoming 
academic year. The company 
that made the analog equip-
ment used by WRCT recently 
stopped producing parts, 
meaning that if their current 
analog equipment breaks, the 
radio station will not be able to 
broadcast.

also connects students and 
faculty with Intel staff and 
individuals at other leading 
design schools for research 
projects and idea generation.
Byrne feels that the part-
nership with Intel is perfect 
at a school  like Carnegie 
Mellon. “We are top ?ve in 
technology, and top 10 in de-
sign and the arts, so we bring 
a great perspective and a lot 
of expertise to the Design 
School Network. The com-
bination of technology, arts 
and design here positions us 
to be leaders of innovation in 
the network and in integra-
tive design.”
IDeATe is meant for the 
“next generation of design-
ers, of computer scientists,” 
Byrne said. “Intel is provid-
ing classroom and product 
support and we’re trying to 
apply them to students. Our 
goal is to get this technology 
in the hands of students and 
see what they can do with it.”
Launching in Fall 2014, 
IDeATe will offer over 28 
courses covering several dif-
ferent concentrations and 
minors in areas including 
animation and special ef-
fects, learning media, me-
dia design, sound design, 
physical computing, and en-
trepreneurship for creative 
industries.  These will con-
nect students from across 
Carnegie Mellon with faculty 
and staff from 25 different 
departments across Carnegie 
Mellon.  
A university press release 
notes that the new IDe-
ATe courses “will focus on 
cutting-edge themes such 
as human-machine virtuos-
ity, physical computing, ex-
panded theater, and mobile 
design.”
Additionally, Byrne feels 
students from across campus 
and across many intersect-
ing disciplines will be able to 
“come together and bridge 
skills, and move towards new 
and innovative outcomes.”
Byrne believes the pro-
gram ?ts in with the times. 
“We’ll be trying to obs\
erve the evolution of these 
courses and understand how 
various experiences can be 
enhanced. We’ll try to gather 
and enhance the quality of 
learning and experiences for 
students.”

a fashion similar to that ad-
opted by all eight Ivy League 
schools. 
Glasner explained that 
current Carnegie Mellon poli-
cy is to report underage drink-
ing to the police, after which 
cited students must appear 
before a Pennsylvania mag-
istrate and receive a citation 
from the state.
Glasner acknowledged the 
potential dif?culties of imple-
menting these reforms, say-
ing, “The roadblocks are de?-
nitely there.” He noted that 
he would begin the process 
with a student referendum or 
petition.
Saigal responded to the 
proposed reform: “When 
it comes to alcohol … our 
main concern should be safe-
ty,” adding, “the real world 
doesn’t handle issues like this 
so lightly.”
Glasner responded to 
people’s ability to clear their 
records through the court 
process by recalling his ex-
periences as an RA and CA, 
saying “almost universally, 
[I’ve heard] from students 
that they don’t grow from 
the process of going to court, 
and what they do grow from 
is a meeting with me or their 
housefellow.” 
He later added, “when you 
send students to court, they 
get angry … they don’t learn 
why they shouldn’t be drink-
ing in a dorm room.” Glasner 
concluded by saying, “The 
informal process isn’t there, 
compared to what our peer 
universities have.”
Ray echoed this sentiment, 
saying that “college is sup-
posed to be a stepping stone 
into the real world.”
Both pairs of candidates 
also discussed communi-
cation between President 
Suresh and the campus com-
munity. Akerele and Saigal 
said “We’ve been pushing for 
two speaking sessions, one in 
the spring and one in the fall.” 
Regarding the president’s vis-
ibility, Glasner responded, “I 
think he did a very good job 
this year.” He also said, “I 
think his reach out to campus 
could be greater, but I’d attri-
bute that to it being his ?rst 
year.”
Wednesday’s debates for 
the SBVPF and SBVPO, held 
in Doherty 2210, were sparse-
ly attended. The ?rst debate 
of the evening for the position 
of SBVPF was among three 
candidates: junior chemi-
cal engineering major Elena 
Karras, junior economics ma-
jor Matthew Greenberg, and 
sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering major 
Divya Kothandapani.
Several questions con-
cerned how the candidates 
would increase understand-
ing among organization lead-
ers regarding their group’s 
?nancial needs, how they 
would address the problem of 
organizations going over their 
allocated JFC budgets, and 
their thoughts on the current 
JFC budgeting process and 
whether they thought it could 
be improved.
In his answers, Greenberg 
stressed the various reforms 
he wishes to institute if elect-
ed to the position. “I’m trying 
to go out there and make sig-
ni?cant changes as to how the 
JFC process works currently,” 
he said. 
He plans to change the 
timetable by which JFC rep-
resentatives are elected and 
to institute a key performance 
indicator (KPI) that would 
make appropriation of fund-
ing “completely objective,” 
according to Greenberg.
Karras and Kothandapani, 
who both already serve as 
Senators for their respective 
colleges and act as represen-
tatives for the JFC, expressed 
many similar ideas regarding 
what they would like to ac-
complish in the position. 
Both candidates empha-
sized their desire to improve 
current policies and proce-
dures within the JFC bud-
geting process, as well as to 
enhance transparency and 
communication between or-
ganizations and their JFC 
representatives.
Greenberg was asked to 
answer questions concern-
ing his KPI proposal to objec-
tively determine JFC funding 
based on the organization’s 
spending history and impact 
on campus, the particulars 
of which he said are still in 
development.
Many expressed concern 
over the KPI, particularly re-
garding its effectiveness and 
necessity. Senior chemistry 
major and current chair of 
Student Senate Lukas Ron-
ner said to The Tartan, “I am 
critical of the KPI because I’ve 
never seen an objective way 
to determine an organiza-
tion’s impact due to the diver-
sity of organizations here on 
campus.”
Following the SBVPF de-
bates, the three candidates for 
student body vice president 
for organizations took to the 
podium: ?rst-year chemical 
engineering and engineering 
and public policy double ma-
jor Trevor Hadick, sophomore 
computer science and math 
double major Jackson Micha-
lak, and sophomore mechani-
cal engineering major Paul 
Kioko.
Many of the questions 
posed to the candidates con-
cerned the current recog-
nition process for student 
organizations and its effec-
tiveness, as well as the SB-
VPO’s role in running the 
Committee on Student Orga-
nizations (CoSO).
Drawing on his current 
involvement in CoSO, Mi-
chalak stressed the need for 
changes to the current rec-
ognition process. “I’ve seen 
many organizations come to 
me trying to get recognized, 
and they struggle. It’s a long 
process; it’s dif?cult; we have 
high standards for our orga-
nizations ... so I would like to 
make these expectations clear 
up front so that we can help 
organizations get through this 
process very quickly.”
Hadick pointed out that he 
would like the SBVPO to also 
serve as a resource for stu-
dents in discovering organiza-
tions that would be right for 
them. “Students want to ?nd 
their niche, but they don’t 
know how to do it. They don’t 
know what organizations are 
out there or where they’ll ?t 
in ... there are a lot of times 
during of?ce hours where stu-
dents should be able to come 
in and talk to me about their 
interests and I can inform of 
the clubs that are on campus 
to ful?ll their interests.”
Fifth year decision science 
and psychology double major 
and current SBVPO Corinne 
Rockoff commented to The 
Tartan, “When I took of?ce, I 
found the biggest hindrance 
to be my lack of experience 
... one candidate having an 
abundance of experience 
should be a really important 
factor for voters to consider.”
Voting closes today at 6 
p.m. Polling stations are avail-
able today from 12–1:30 p.m. 
and 5–6 p.m. in the UC Kirr 
Commons. Voters can also

Students do service for 1000plus
This Saturday marked the 
seventh year of 1000plus, a 
massive organizational feat 
which, last year, engaged 
1,053 volunteers with 32 
charities, 20 buses, and 54 
large groups. Although the 
count has not yet been ?nal-
ized, this year appears to be 
even larger.
According to Vivian Chang, 
the president of the 1000plus 
executive board and a senior 
policy and management and 
psychology double major, the 
Greek organizations are par-
ticularly active in 1000plus. 
The biggest group this year  
was Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 
with 74 members participat-
ing in the event.
“1000plus is a great op-
portunity for people to volun-
teer; it’s low commitment so 
it ?ts easily into people’s busy 
schedules,” said Chang, who 
added that some students 
learn about charities through 
1000plus and continue to vol-
unteer with them for years to 
come.
This year, alumni in Mas-
sachusetts and North Caro-
lina organized their own ser-
vice projects to coincide with 
the 1000plus event at the 
Pittsburgh campus. 
Some 50 alumni took part, 
a large number given that 
1000plus began in 2008, so 
only recent alumni may be 
aware of the tradition.
This year also saw the in-
troduction of some interest-
ing new charities like Global 
Links, a group that sends 
medical surplus supplies 
which would be otherwise 
thrown away to poor coun-
tries. Volunteers helped sort 
and package medical supplies 
so they could be shipped off to 
countries in need.
Another new charity, 
Southside Slopes Neighbor-
hood Association, had 
volunteers working in 
Monongahela Park, removing 
invasive species and picking 
up litter. “Its amazing how 
much people can give back in 
just one day,” said Smith.

Smartphones collect data to predict onset of depression
BROOKE KUEI
SciTech Editor
How smart have our smart-
phones become? So smart that 
they might know us better 
than we know ourselves, ac-
cording to associate professor 
of the School of Computer Sci-
ence and the Human-Comput-
er Interaction Institute (HCII) 
Jason Hong and associate pro-
fessor of HCII and the School 
of Design John Zimmerman. 
By taking advantage of how 
much information our smart-
phones are able to obtain, 
Hong and Zimmerman are 
studying how smartphone 
data can help predict the onset 
of depression.
The World Economic Fo-
rum recently released its Top 
10 Emerging Technologies list 
for 2014. One of these innova-
tions was the quanti?ed self 
— the idea that data obtained 
from the monitoring of a per-
son’s daily routines can be use-
fully analyzed. 
“Quanti?ed self is sort of 
the idea that there is small 
data about each individual,” 
Zimmerman explained. “We’re 
looking at the small data — 
what all of the stuff we might 
know about an individual is 
and if we can pull relevant and 
meaningful information.”
The quanti?ed self has 
been made increasingly pos-
sible as smartphones continu-
ally advance. For example, 
there are many applications 
and devices that allow us-
ers to track their exercising 
and eating habits in a way 
that can help them improve 
their health, such as Fitbit or 
MyFitnessPal. Hong and Zim-
merman’s research takes this 
concept one step further by 
delving into how smartphone 
data can reveal symptoms of 
depression. Originally funded 
by the Defense Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency (DAR-
PA), their research is focused 
on detecting depression in re-
turning soldiers.
Their main motivation be-
hind this endeavor stems from 
the fact that it often takes four 
to six weeks to get a ?rst ap-
pointment with a therapist. 
According to Hong and Zim-
meran, installing their app, 
called Big Black Dog, will al-
low individuals to self-mon-
itor their habits in a way that 
will allow them to receive a 
better diagnosis when they 
do have their appointment. 
Between appointments, the 
app can also be used to track 
whether or not their treatment 
has caused a change in their 
behavior.
Big Black Dog uses sensory 
data to gather information 
about the individual. For ex-
ample, sound levels, bright-
ness of surroundings, whether 
the screen is on or not, and 
geotagged data are all types of 
information that the app will 
gather. 
It will also look at social in-
teractions, such as how often 
the individual makes phone 
calls or converses with people 
through text messages. The 
combination of all this data 
can result in some trends that 
will show a picture of the per-
son’s health and be a predictor 
of depression. Two behaviors 
with which depression is most 
highly correlated are social 
isolation and a poor sleep 
schedule.
“So you probably see there 
are several trends that are 
going on here,” Hong noted. 
“One is that sensors and devic-
es are becoming much cheap-
er so now we can capture more 
data. Another trend is that we 
can capture a lot of data about 
our health outside of hospitals 
and outside of clinics more 
than we could before. These 
are two trends that are just go-
ing to keep on continuing.”
Besides spotting depres-
sion in a target audience such 
as returning soldiers, Hong 
and Zimmerman also conduct 
other research that uses the 
concept of the quanti?ed self. 
For example, Zimmerman 
worked with associate profes-
sor of HCII Anind K. Dey on an 
application for busy parents. 
The application can learn the 
pickup and drop-off routines 
of parents for their kids’ events 
so that if a parent forgets to be 
somewhere at a certain time, 
they will be sent a reminder 
noti?cation.
Similarly, Hong worked 
with professor in the Institute 
for Software Research Nor-
man Sadeh on a project called 
Livehoods, which uses Four-
square check-ins and other 
geotagged data to create a 
map that identi?es regions in 
less of a geographical way and 
more of a cultural way. 
For example, data shows 
that even though Shadyside 
is known as one region, it is 
actually broken down into a 
more residential side and a 
more commercial side where 
there are many restaurants 
and stores.
Besides these projects, 
the quanti?ed self can be ap-
plied to many different types 
of studies. Hong expressed 
interest in exploring the quan-
ti?ed self to learn more about 
the ?rst-year experience at 
Carnegie Mellon in a way that 
will allow future ?rst-year stu-
dents to learn from the classes 
that came before them.

Computational medicine is used to categorize asthma
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Staffwriter
Doctors endure years and 
years of training to fully un-
derstand the human body in 
order to treat their patients. 
Nevertheless, collecting all 
the necessary information 
and generating an accurate 
diagnosis can be a daunting 
task that may cause even the 
most skilled clinician to run 
out of breath.
Computers, on the other 
hand, don’t run out of breath.
Wei Wu, an associate pro-
fessor and researcher at Carn-
egie Mellon’s Lane Center for 
Computational Biology, has 
used the power of computa-
tional techniques to rede?ne 
how doctors can diagnose 
their patients. 
Wu’s ?ndings, published 
in the Journal of Allergy and 
Clinical Immunology, uses ma-
chine-learning algorithms to 
analyze a wide scope of vari-
ables collected from asthma 
patients to determine the se-
verity of their condition. Wu 
refers to the project uniquely 
as “computational medicine” 
and said that by using these 
methods, they “were able 
to characterize asthma pa-
tients with around 90 percent 
accuracy.”
In order to decide the best 
form of treatment for their pa-
tients, doctors ?rst identify a 
patient’s symptoms and relate 
them to the severity of the 
disease. 
Unfortunately, the capac-
ity of the human brain limits 
the number of factors they 
can take into account during 
their analysis. Traditionally, 
doctors use a small number of 
variables and rely largely on 
experience to relate patients 
who have similar conditions 
and prescribe them similar 
treatments.
Wu and physicians agree 
that “we need to rede?ne 
asthma since we can get so 
many more measurements.”
In collaboration with Sally 
E. Wenzel, director of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s Asthma 
Institute, Wu and Wenzel 
collected information of 112 
variables from 378 patients. 
Variables ranged from general 
aspects, such as age of asthma 
onset, to more speci?c scien-
ti?c measurements like lung 
volumes. They even included 
other factors, such as the en-
vironment and emotion that 
could be collected from pa-
tient questionnaires.
It is an impossible task 
to expect a doctor to make 
sense of all of these variables 
at one time. Wu’s approach 
can take all the available in-
formation to make the best 
judgement for the severity 
of the patients’s asthma. The 
doctor can use this infor-
mation to treat the patient 
appropriately. 
Wu explained that initially 
the algorithm uses an unsu-
pervised learning technique, 
assuming that nothing is 
known about the relationships 
between the variables and the 
severity of the asthma. 
Using a small sample of the 
experimental data, the algo-
rithm identi?es patterns and 
uses statistical approaches to 
generate clusters of patients. 
Each cluster is related to a dif-
ferent level of severity.
Then, similar to how a 
doctor will use their knowl-
edge and experience, the al-
gorithm relays the patterns it 
has identi?ed to take in new 
experimental data and cluster 
the patients. Each cluster can 
then have its own prescribed 
treatment. 
However, Wu explained 
that her collaborators are 
concerned that even though 
their techniques appear to be 
successful, “the method is not 
yet practical because you can-
not always expect to collect all 
112 variables of information.”
Some of the variables are 
based on similar measure-
ments, so Wu and her team 
identi?ed which variables 
appeared to be redundant. 
They eliminated the redun-
dant variables and reanalyzed 
the data. Wu said, “I was very 
confused when I saw that this 
time, the accuracy of our pre-
dictions dropped to slightly 
above eighty percent.” She be-
lieves that even though these 
variables appear to overlap, 
they do not overlap complete-
ly. For example, if the infor-
mation contained in a mea-
surement can be pictured as 
a circle, two similar measure-
ments have circles that almost 
completely cover each other. 
However, the small sections 
of the circle that are not cov-
ered are still useful measure-
ments toward a diagnosis and 
are necessary for achieving a 
higher accuracy.
Wu explained, “Another 
aspect is that the algorithm 
will rank each variable based 
on its ability to contribute to 
the accuracy of a diagnosis,” 
which can provide insight into 
which variables are strongly 
correlated with the disease 
and allow doctors to focus on 
these factors when making 
their diagnosis. Oftentimes in 
similar research, the conclu-
sions reached by a computer 
algorithm will make no sense 
to the physician. 
However, the highest 
ranked variables by the pro-
gram are generally the same 
variables that physicians 
would normally focus on dur-
ing their analysis of a patient. 
Wu said that seeing a compu-
tational and medical agree-
ment helped them feel con?-
dent about the robustness of 
their approach.
Wu is very proud of the 
way the computational and 
medical aspects of this project 
agreed so well and believes 
that it was directly condu-
cive to their success. Wu and

plore reducing the number

The methods they develop

Gittis studies neuroscience behind compulsive disorders
CLAIRE GIANAKAS

Many Carnegie Mellon 
researchers are currently 
involved in cutting-edge re-
search focused on under-
standing the complex ways 
in which the brain functions. 
Aryn Gittis, an assistant pro-
fessor in biological sciences, 
as well as a member of the 
joint Carnegie Mellon and 
University of Pittsburgh Cen-
ter for the Neural Basis of 
Cognition, has received a two-
year NARSAD Young Inves-
tigator Grant from the Brain 
and Behavior Research Foun-
dation, which she will use to 
study the mechanisms behind 
compulsive behavior.
Gittis initially began work-
ing with a part of the brain 
called the basal ganglia — 
which is located in the base 
of the forebrain and is pri-
marily associated with action 
selection — as a post doctoral 
researcher at the Gladstone 
Institute of Neurological Dis-
ease. “When I started my post 
doc, I wanted to start studying 
the basal ganglia because it 
was relevant for so many dif-
ferent diseases,” Gittis said. 
“It was almost serendipitous 
that I became interested in 
compulsive behavior because 
I found some genetic tools to 
study different populations of 
neurons in a part of the basal 
ganglia called the globus 
pallidus.”
Gittis discovered that 
when certain populations of 
neurons in mice were acti-
vated, the mice became hy-
peractive. Along with other 
research, this ?nding suggest-
ed that the globus pallidus is 
involved in many compulsive 
behaviors, such as attention 
de?cit hyperactivity disorder, 
obsessive-compulsive disor-
der, and Tourette’s syndrome. 
“The globus pallidus seems to 
be a site of convergence for 
a lot of different pathways 
that have all been implicated 
in compulsive behavior,” ex-
plained Gittis.
The NARSAD Young Inves-
tigator Grant is given to early 
career scientists who intend to 
pursue the study of brain and 
behavior disorders. Gittis and 
her team, including post doc-
toral fellow Amelie Soumier, 
?rst-year biology major Bran-
don Rogowski, and senior bi-
ology and psychology double 
major Nick Zuniga, will use 
the NARSAD grant to conduct 
follow-up research on her pre-
vious ?ndings about the glo-
bus pallidus. 
In particular, Gittis notes 
that Parkinson’s disease is a 
main focus of her research. 
They will use optogenetics 
— a technique which uses 
light to control neurons in the 
brain — to determine how 
behavior changes when cells 
in the globus pallidus are ac-
tivated or deactivated. “It’s 
a way of turning on and off 
genetically distinct neural cir-
cuits so that we are able to see 
how behavior changes when 
these [circuits] are on or off,” 
Gittis said. 
In this way, they will be 
able to determine which 
populations of neurons 
are involved in compulsive 
behavior.
“We want to ?gure out if 
the increase in movement 
we’re seeing is due to general 
hyperactivity of neural cir-
cuits, or if it’s due to the in-
ability of animals to suppress 
movements, which would be 
more like a compulsive behav-
ior,” said Gittis. “We want to 
expand the behavioral tests 
that we’ve tested, and in ad-
dition to turning cells on, we 
want to also turn cells off.”
Gittis’ research has the po-
tential to have a large impact 
in the world of neuroscience. 
“There’s a huge need in neu-
roscience to understand how 
all these different classes of 
neurons we’ve identi?ed in-
teract with one another and 
how they are activated — 
both in normal behavior and 
in disease states,” explained 
Gittis. But the research could 
also have important pharma-
cological effects. “A lot of the 
medications we currently use 
are medications that were dis-
covered decades ago, and we 
still don’t really understand 
how they work,” Gittis said. 
“The hope is that by being 
able to delve into neural cir-
cuits at the cell type level and 
identify unique classes of neu-
rons, we can then ?gure out 
ways to pharmacologically, 
selectively target those cells.”
Gittis also noted that the 
way neurons function is an 
important stepping stone on 
the way to the development 
of treatments: “Eventually it 
will lead to drug development 
... but we ?rst need to under-
stand how the neurons work 
and how they interact with 
one another.”
This research could help 
scientists understand the 
mechanisms behind brain 
and neuron activity. Once the 
mechanisms are more clearly 
understood, researchers will 
be able to more easily develop 
new and more effective treat-
ments and therapies to coun-
teract a variety of neurologi-
cal disorders.

Special to The Tartan
The topic of this week’s 
Pugwash discussion was hy-
draulic fracturing — more 
colloquially referred to as 
fracking. Fracking is a method 
of extracting natural gas out 
of shale rock in the ground. 
It has been in development 
for decades, but only reached 
technological maturity in the 
last ?ve years. Since then, nat-
ural gas has rapidly replaced 
coal ?re power plants across 
the United States, and has 
accounted for about 81 per-
cent of the nation’s installed 
electricity capacity in the last 
decade, according to GRACE 
Communications Foundation.
There are both advantages 
and disadvantages to natural 
gas utilization. According to 
the United States Environ-
mental Protection Agency 
(EPA), the fuel from natural 
gas releases about half as 
much carbon dioxide as coal 
for the same amount of en-
ergy when burned, and even 
smaller amounts of other dan-
gerous chemicals. The fuel is 
also extremely economical; 
for example, an article in 
Forbes discussed how cheap 
natural gas led to a boom in 
the economy of North Dakota. 
To some, it is the only reason-
able way of reducing emis-
sions while maintaining a 
strong economy. On the other 
hand, fracking has led to fears 
of environmental destruction. 
Videos have appeared online 
demonstrating how ground-
water contamination in the 
areas around hydraulic frac-
turing sites has lead to ?am-
mable tap water. Additionally, 
hydraulic fracturing involves 
catching the methane that 
escapes from shale rock. Any 
methane that escapes will 
leak into the atmosphere, 
and acts as a greenhouse gas 
about 20 times as potent as 
carbon dioxide, according to 
the EPA. Another concern is 
that fracking may simply be 
increasing our reliance on fos-
sil fuels, making clean energy 
even less of a reality.
Following a general dis-
cussion of the pros and cons 
of fracking, the conversation 
turned to how these advan-
tages and disadvantages com-
pared to each other in weight. 
For example, the 2010 docu-
mentary Gasland was cited to 
explain that the most danger-
ous of the disadvantages to 
fracking is water contamina-
tion. However, it was noted 
that most policymakers con-
sider the release of methane 
from fracking sites to be the 
biggest issue with fracking. If 
experts consider the methane 
emission to be worse than the 
ground water contamination, 
then we could have a catastro-
phe on our hands.
While it was pointed out 
that we cannot make the good 
the enemy of the perfect, 
and that fracking is at least 
preferable to coal in terms 
of environmental destruc-
tion, these points sparked a 
conversation about how we 
do not even consider renew-
ables to be options, when, in 
fact, they are. A century ago, 
when the infrastructure of the 
?rst power plants were put in 
place, energy innovators did 
not consider the long-term ef-
fects of their decisions and as-
sumed that environmental is-
sues would be solved by now. 
This mistake is not one that 
can be made again. As we ne-
glect to set up the infrastruc-
ture for renewable energy, we 
are making it more and more 
dif?cult for ourselves in the 
future to build newer, cleaner 
energy solutions. If we do not 
act now, we never will.
However, this urgency 
for renewable energy sourc-
es was subdued a little by 
a counterargument. It was 
clari?ed that when a resource 
becomes scarce, it will be-
come expensive. Thus, it is 
in a pro?t-focused company’s 
best interest to invest in more 
nonrenewable energy sourc-
es, simply for their long-term 
economic survival. This point 
makes fracking seem more 
reasonable because com-
panies can invest in it now, 
and then invest in renewable 
sources when they are inevi-
tably forced to. 
However, we should not 
consider corporations to be 
so focused on the long term; 
by the time these companies 
decide to change, it may be 
environmentally too late. 
These corporations may fail 
as energy resources are de-
pleted and the world will be 
in trouble, but we should not 
wait for this scenario to hap-
pen: if they fail, the entire 
planet fails with them.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organi-
zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science. This article 
is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on fracking.

Only two percent of all the 
habitable land on the face of 
the Earth has not been physi-
cally interacted with and 
touched by humans, accord-
ing to The Seattle Times. While 
we as humans like to think 
that we know as much as pos-
sible about the planet that we 
live on, it turns out that there 
are a plethora of secrets Moth-
er Nature is keeping from us. 
One of these hidden treasures 
is underground rivers.
Underground, or subter-
ranean, rivers are rivers that 
?ow beneath the surface of 
the Earth. They come in all 
sorts of forms and sizes, but 
many underground rivers 
commonly begin as normal, 
above-ground rivers that ?ow 
into an underground cave 
and then eventually resurface 
back into the open.
Before we talk about how 
other types of these under-
water beauties form, it is 
?rst important to understand 
how their above-land cousins 
come about. The process by 
which a common river forms 
is not intuitive or obvious at 
?rst. The questions, “Where 
does it start?” and, “How does 
the water not just soak into 
the land?” are the key ques-
tions to answer. 
A river begins as a stream 
that usually originates from a 
mountain or a glacier. These 
individual streams will then 
collide with others that are 
heading down the mountain, 
forming a bigger stream. 
Eventually, a river forms from 
the combined contributions of 
multiple streams. Whenever a 
smaller river converges with a 
bigger river, the smaller one is 
called a tributary.
According to OneGeol-
ogy, the formation of a river 
is equally dependent on the 
formation of a riverbed. In 
order for a riverbed to form, 
the soil on the ground cannot 
soak up all the water ?owing 
over it. Soil has a saturation 
limit, making it possible for 
the water not to be pulled 
into the ground. Different 
soils have different saturation 
limits, and so there are good 
riverbed soils and bad river-
bed soils. For instance, con-
sider clay and sand. The par-
ticles in clay are much smaller 
than those of sand; when clay 
particles are packed closely 
together, there is less space 
between them. Thus, when 
the water ?ows over the clay, 
less water is lodged between 
the particles. Sand, on the 
other hand, would not be an 
effective riverbed because 
lots of the water ?owing over 
it could lodge itself into the 
space in between particles.
Subterranean rivers have 
very similar properties. In 
order to form, they need two 
conditions: a good water sup-
ply and a riverbed. The wa-
ter for underground rivers is 
usually water that has seeped 
through all the layers of soil, 
from above the surface to be-
low the surface, and reached 
the forming river. The river-
bed, similarly, forms when 
water seeping through the 
ground reaches an imperme-
able type of soil. It stops mov-
ing downward and begins to 
move horizontally in the di-
rection of what will become 
the river. According to The 
Telegraph, the water in un-
derground rivers has higher 
salinity; therefore, this denser 
water ?ows like a river along 
the sea bed.
With no markers above the 
surface, underground rivers 
have to be uncovered using 
scienti?c methods. One such 
method uses mathematical 
models to follow the ?ow of 
water through the ground. 
This method works because 
water initially moves vertical-
ly through the earth and then 
changes direction if it enters 
an underground river.
Due to their inconspicuous 
nature, subterranean rivers 
have been found in all sorts 
of unexpected places. For in-
stance, in 2011, The Guard-
ian reported that scientists 
discovered a massive under-
ground river four kilometers 
below the Amazon river. This 
river, named the Hamza River 
after its discoverer, ?ows for 
over 6,000 kilometers and 
ranges from 200 kilometers 
to 400 kilometers in width. 
Another famous underground 
river, referred to by The Huff-
ington Post as “a scuba diver’s 
dream,” is Cenote Angelita 
in Mexico and has become a 
popular tourist attraction.

New technique may save lives at UPMC
Surgeons at the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center 
(UPMC) will test out a new 
lifesaving technique on 10 pa-
tients with gunshot and knife 
wounds by suspending them 
between life and death. The 
process, known as emergency 
preservation and resuscita-
tion, involves replacing a pa-
tient’s blood with a cool sa-
line solution and signi?cantly 
lowering the patient’s body 
temperature. The surgeons 
will then perform operations, 
and the saline will be replaced 
again with blood. The idea is 
to keep the bodies of indi-
viduals with severe trauma in 
a “preserved” state that will 
keep them from dying.
Cells in this arrested state 
don’t require oxygen to stay 
alive because there are no 
metabolic activities occur-
ring, making the patient 
clinically dead.  With the 
technique in place, UPMC 
surgeons are waiting on-call 
for their ?rst eligible patient.

CDC says autism prevalence 1 in 68
The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention an-
nounced that one in 68 chil-
dren are diagnosed with 
autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), a 30 percent increase 
from 2008, which stated an 
autism prevalence of one in 
88. Professionals in the ?eld 
are unsure if the increase is 
due to increased sensitivity 
in surveillance, an increase 
in cases, or a combination of 
both.
Many agree that the data 
needs to undergo further 
analysis. Rates between states 
varied dramatically, for in-
stance; New Jersey had a 
prevalence of one in 45 while 
Alabama had one in 175.

Studies show crows are able to reason
A recent study with New 
Caledonian crows have shown 
the birds to have some level of 
understanding of water dis-
placement. In the study, re-
searchers put Aesop’s fable to 
a real-world test: Can a crow 
place objects in a pool in order 
to make the water level rise 
and reach a treat?
The results show they 
could in certain situations. 
The crows were given six 
tasks, and were able to com-
plete four of them. They 
chose to drop stones into 
water-?lled tubes rather than 
sand; dropped sinking objects 
rather than ?oating; dropped 
dense objects as opposed to 
hollow ones; and dropped 
objects into tubes with high 
water levels rather than lower 
water levels. 
Although the crows failed 
two more complicated tasks, 
the researchers assess their 
causal reasoning abilities on 
par with a 5–7 year old hu-
man child.

Arti?cial yeast chromosome made
Researchers at Johns Hop-
kins University have recently 
created an arti?cial chromo-
some for baker’s yeast, the 
?rst time that a synthetic 
chromosome has been creat-
ed for a eukaryotic organism. 
The team, which included 
multiple undergraduate stu-
dents, was able to create chro-
mosome No. 3 of the yeast. 
They created sequences of 
DNA, stitched them together, 
and then put the sequence 
into a yeast cell, which used 
proteins to coil and package 
the sequence into a chromo-
some. The researchers left 
out segments of DNA from the 
original yeast that they didn’t 
feel necessary.

Pollutants make male ?sh feminine
Male ?sh off the coast of 
Basque Country, Spain have 
been found to be under-
going feminization due to 
pollutants. 
The pollutants, which 
act as estrogen, have caused 
the male ?sh to develop ovo-
cytes. Researchers analyzed 
thick-lipped gray mullet 
found in different estuaries 
around Spain. The pollut-
ants that may be the cause of 
the feminization are part of a 
class of chemicals known as 
endocrine-disrupters.
Although endocrine-dis-
rupters have only been noted 
recently, they are found in 
many common products, such 
as contraceptives, fragrances, 
detergent, and pesticides. 
In addition to the ovocytes, 
some male ?sh tested positive 
for molecular markers and 
proteins that are typically 
only found in female ?sh. The 
scientists believe a source of 
the pollutants may be from a 
local water treatment plant.

Researchers ?lter light in new ways
For the ?rst time, light 
may be able to be ?ltered 
depending on what angle or 
direction it is coming from, 
adding to the current ability 
to ?lter light by color or polar-
ization. The new technique, 
developed by researchers at 
the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, allows light of 
any color to pass through a 
system only if it comes from a 
certain angle; all other light is 
re?ected. 
This breakthrough could 
be used for detectors in micro-
scopes, telescopes, and priva-
cy screens for computers.

Girl Scouts empowers with ?nancial literacy 
Pittsburgh open data encourages public trust
Corporate choices should not trump personal
Eunice Oh/Assistant Art Editor
The latest Girl Scouts selling 
season has unveiled a new cookie 
queen. Over the past eight weeks, 
12-year-old Oklahoma Girl Scout 
Kate Francis sold over 18,100 boxes 
of cookies, according to Forbes. Fran-
cis — a young girl who, if she wants 
it, undoubtedly has a very promising 
future in business— broke the previ-
ous cookie-selling record of 18,000, 
held since 1986. 
Though Francis’s story may seem 
like the small-scale victory of one 
highly impressive girl, it speaks to 
the larger importance of  empower-
ment through ?nancial literacy to 
young girls. Girl Scouts places girls 
in the position to learn valuable life 
skills, such as money management, 
time ef?ciency, interpersonal com-
munication, leadership, and perse-
verance in pursuit of goals.  
Money management, and person-
al ?nance in general, is notoriously 
neglected in formal elementary and 
high school education. As the largest     
female-run business worldwide, the 
Girl Scouts cookie selling program 
provides girls with the crucial ?-
nancial skills that formal education 
continues to fall short of adequately 
teaching. 
Programs like the Girl Scouts, 
and similar initiatives in formal edu-
cation, should be encouraged and 
advanced. They may be key to the 
development of such skills that play 
a vital role in fostering the next gen-
eration of successful female leaders.
The adoption of Pittsburgh’s open 
data initiative is not only a victory for 
proponents of open government, but 
also signals an important and long-
needed shift in city governance.
Through the open data law, of?-
cially adopted on March 11, the city 
will require that non-sensitive gov-
ernment data be posted online, en-
courage open policy standards, and 
guide departments in releasing their 
data for public viewing. Open data 
not only allows for greater transpar-
ency between the public and their 
government, but can also be used in 
academic studies on public policy is-
sues. 
The results from these studies can 
become valuable to the governments 
themselves, providing novel analy-
ses which can improve the function 
of governmental systems and policy 
implementation. 
Pittsburgh’s new mayor Bill Pedu-
to has shown an extraordinary com-
mitment to 21st century government 
by embracing Pittsburgh’s potential 
to have both a tech-friendly city and 
a tech-friendly government. Addi-
tionally, the mayor has sent a strong 
example by opening Pittsburgh’s 
mayoral of?ce, posting his schedule 
online for public viewing, tweeting 
regarding his location and work, and 
promoting responsible governance.
These measures come in sharp 
contrast to Pittsburgh’s previous 
mayor Luke Ravenstahl, who ran 
a decidedly closed mayor’s of?ce 
which was often at odds with the 
public of Pittsburgh and city govern-
ment itself. Ravenstahl is currently 
facing an FBI investigation regard-
ing allegations of the use of taxpayer 
money for personal purposes. 
A recent article published by CBS 
Pittsburgh reveals that Ravenstahl 
left the mayor’s of?ce with over 
$200,000 in missing or damaged 
property. This report reveals that 
this ?gure includes items such as a 
Pittsburgh Steelers’ 2006 Super Bowl 
victory trophy and of?ce repairs, in-
cluding a damaged painting and four 
broken chandeliers in the mayor’s of-
?ce itself.
Peduto told CBS Pittsburgh “I 
don’t know why the public should 
have to pay for missing items or 
damaged items,” explaining that he 
turned the list of missing and dam-
aged items over to the FBI.
Mayor Peduto’s adoption of an 
open data initiative not only allows 
for studies on policy to be conducted 
for the bene?t of both government 
and taxpayers, but also signals a wel-
come shift away from the actions of  
Luke Ravenstahl. 
Last Tuesday, the Supreme Court 
heard preliminary discussions of Se-
belius v. Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby 
is a chain of craft stores throughout 
parts of the United States. Hobby 
Lobby argues that the company 
should not have to provide certain 
types of birth control to their female 
employees, despite that birth control 
being included in the employees’ 
health insurance, because doing so 
violates the company’s religious be-
liefs. This argument hinges on the 
idea that companies have a certain 
level of personhood and can have re-
ligious beliefs at all. 
There are several problems with 
this argument. First, it prioritizes 
corporate choice over personal 
choice. By Hobby Lobby’s logic, the 
company has the right to restrict 
the choices of many individuals who 
work for them, based off the com-
pany’s religious beliefs, which are 
actually the religious beliefs of the 
owners themselves. Passing this rul-
ing would not lead to an increased 
allowance of choice in the United 
States, it would merely narrow the 
playing ?eld of who is allowed to 
make those choices. 
Second, restricting access to 
emergency contraceptives, such as 
Plan B or ella, in addition to IUDs, 
discriminates against female em-
ployees. 
The company’s owners can feel, 
however, they like about birth con-
trol in their personal lives. Never-
theless, those beliefs absolutely do 
not give them the right to prevent 
women from taking a medication 
that they might require, either for 
preventing pregnancy or for a myr-
iad of other medical bene?ts, such 
relief from excessive acne or severe 
menstruation pains, as well as a dra-
matically lower risk of endometrial 
and ovarian cancer. 
Beyond even the medical issue 
presented by this case, Hobby Lob-
by’s argument is that the company’s 
supposed religious freedoms allow 
for such discrimination against fe-
male employees. This ruling would 
have no effect on male employees; 
no one is arguing that companies 
should not have to pay for male em-
ployee’s Viagra. 
All of the members of Hobby 
Lobby have a right to their religious 
beliefs, including both the own-
ers of the company and the average 
employees. However, one of those 
groups does not get to choose for the 
other. 
JUSTIN YAN 
Over the past few weeks, as 
events in Crimea and Ukraine con-
tinue to make daily headlines, many 
have claimed that we are witnessing 
the rise of the next big geopolitical 
con?ict since the Cold War. Some 
have made an even more extreme 
claim, saying that this crisis marks 
the return of the United States and 
Russia to the Cold War.
It is hard to believe now that 
the entire struggle in Ukraine was 
started by protests in the streets. 
There has been little word on the 
status of Russia’s relationship with 
ousted former Ukrainian president 
Viktor Yanukovych. All eyes are fo-
cused on Russian troop movements 
on the Ukraine border. Maybe Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin sees 
this con?ict as a continuation of the 
Cold War. Putin described Russia’s 
annexation of Crimea as retribution 
for “a deeply-held grievance about 
what he considers to be the loss of 
the Soviet Union.” As hard as it may 
be, the United States must lead the 
so-called Western powers in an ef-
fort to tear down the barriers be-
tween East and West that have ex-
isted since the Cold War.
There are many reasons to sup-
port this belief. After all, Russia 
is trying to bulldoze its way into 
Ukraine and exert its in?uence, 
which has waned ever since the 
rise of the European Union. Since 
much of Europe is dependent on 
Russian natural gas, Russia sees no 
reason to ?lter itself and no reason 
to hold itself back. Putin — always 
the cunning but brash diplomat — is 
clearly pushing forward, as reports 
estimate that 40,000 Russian troops 
have gathered at the border.
Though a resurgence of the Cold 
War implies an escalation on the mil-
itary scale for all nations involved, 
this criteria has become inaccurate. 
The world has become much too 
interconnected and too globalized 
to have a true Cold War. In fact, just 
this past week, Obama has been in 
the Hague and elsewhere in the 
Netherlands, trying to tie up treaties 
and deals to denuclearize the world. 
Obama’s idea in doing so is to secure 
weapons-grade radioactive material 
in a manner safe for both the people 
and the environment, and safe from 
terrorist thieves. 
Many leaders, especially those 
who lead smaller nations like Singa-
pore, have reacted to such a summit 
with relief. As Prime Minister of Sin-
gapore Lee Hsien Loong stated, “We 
would like the work to continue, 
but we have to consider how, [and] 
what is the most appropriate way 
the leaders can get involved,” ac-
cording to Channel NewsAsia.
It all goes back to the ques-
tion: who decides who gets nuclear 
power? As the world evolves to ac-
commodate more and more people, 
countries are increasingly turning to 
nuclear power as their “sustainable” 
energy source. Singapore — a na-
tion with developed infrastructure 
but lacking nuclear power — is just 
one example of a major Asian eco-
nomic hub and productive power 
that could easily shift toward nucle-
ar energy.
But how is the world supposed to 
denuclearize itself while facing an 
increasing shortage of resources? 
Moreover, how can the world accom-
plish denuclearization when Russia, 
one of its counterparts — the one 
with the most sizable nuclear arse-
nal of all — has actively partaken in 
an act of nuclear aggression? Con-
ferences like these are extremely im-
portant, but with the United States 
and other Western nations pursuing 
a policy of sanctions — which don’t 
accomplish much — it is hard to 
see Russia holding ties with such a 
conference.
President Obama faced backlash 
when he condemned Russia this past 
week, but according to The New York 
Times, he pressed too far forward, 
and justi?ed the use of force in Iraq, 
a war that is constantly berated as 
being imperialistic. Sanctions seem 
to be the ?rst step in a diplomat’s 
handbook. They immediately place 
countries on different sides, as if 
sanctions lead to isolation, which 
leads to war. This logical chain of 
events is hardly wrong — just look 
at North Korea. After sanction upon 
sanction, the small Asian state is as 
alienated as ever.
What the United States needs to 
do is to maintain its leadership po-
sition in condemning Russia. How-
ever, while the United States contin-
ues to pursue a policy of squeezing 
Russian leaders out with some sort 
of economic siege, the world heads 
closer and closer to Cold War-like 
relations. 
“While the United 
States continues to 
pursue a policy of 
squeezing Russian 
leaders out ... the 
world heads closer 
and closer to Cold 
War-like relations.”
Still, as the conference in Hague 
has shown, the world has become 
much too weaponized and sensi-
tive to the risk of nuclear warfare to 
ever fall into another Cold War-like 
nuclear standoff. Meanwhile, Rus-
sia — large and distant — has be-
come much too insensitive to ever 
simply agree to nuclear sanctions. 
Sanctions will only make relations 
between Russia and the rest of the 
world colder, and even if Russia 
settles with the West, relations will 
likely be as weak as ever.
In order to strengthen rela-
tions with Russia, the United States 
should look to China, another na-
tion that cannot afford to be alienat-
ed by the United States. The United 
States must, in the long-run, seek 
better relations with China. As hard 
as this may sound, the relationship 
between China and America must 
extend beyond trade.
 China has long admired the Unit-
ed States’ international superiority, 
but the United States has long eyed 
China with suspicion. China, as one 
of Russia’s closest allies — if you can 
even call them that — has the key to 
unlock Russia from being a massive, 
mysterious nation to a more relent-
ing nation that might just be open to 
negotiations. 
The United States must look past 
sanctions and pick up Russia along 
the way, perhaps through China. 
The conference in the Hague just 
shows how important diplomacy is, 
while also showing that the world 
must avoid alienating any major 
power, including Russia.

A PERSON’S OPINION
The Tartan is trying to stay on top of the news this week. So we asked,
When people come to Carnegie Mellon, do they become detached from current events?
Compiled by Sara Remi Fields
Millennials will shake up political future
MOHAMMED BURNY
Junior Staffwriter
The American millennial has ar-
rived. Born after 1980 and active 
over the last 15 years, millennials 
have gone to college in record num-
bers and piled up more student loan 
debt than either of the last two gen-
erations of Americans. In the wake of 
9/11, they fought in the longest war 
in American history against Afghani-
stan, as well as in another incompre-
hensible war in Iraq. In the wake of 
the Great Recession, they are strug-
gling to enter the workforce. Mil-
lennials voted en masse for Barack 
Obama in 2008 and 2012, drawn 
by his post-racial and post-partisan 
message. Six years into Obama’s 
presidency, they constitute 27 per-
cent of the adult American popula-
tion, and are still growing fully into 
their place in American society. It is 
imperative that we understand the 
formative qualities of this genera-
tion if we are to forecast the shape of 
American society in the 21st century.
The millennial is pragmatic. Mil-
lennials were raised in an Informa-
tion Age, and they expect immedi-
ate and objective answers to their 
questions. Privileging information or 
giving it an ideological slant irritates 
them, and they seek to ?atten, if not 
obliterate, traditional hierarchies of 
knowledge. The rise of massive on-
line open courses (MOOCs) in the 
last ?ve years speaks to this strain 
in millennial culture. The priest, the 
businessman, and the representative 
— these three institutional ?gures, 
and the alleged truths that they are 
privy to — neither impress millen-
nials nor command their allegiance. 
Only the facts can do that, and in 
this Information Age, the facts are at 
their ?ngertips.
The millennial craves peer-to-
peer contact. Having eschewed the 
communities encoded in the church 
and the boardroom, millennials in-
vented digital social networks. On 
platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, 
and Skype, they exist in a web of rich 
and genuine connectivity with their 
friends, colleagues, and like-minded 
groups.
These digital natives abhor the 
arti?ciality of traditional politicians. 
They have no automatic respect for 
the hierarchical nature of American 
politics. They seek authenticity from 
their elected of?cials and from the 
political process in general. Because 
we live in a democracy, the cham-
bers of our government have been 
marginally more responsive than the 
church and the boardroom to this 
desire for authenticity.
Barack Obama went from obscu-
rity to presidency in the space of four 
years because he transcended the 
usual tribal din of American politics. 
He spoke of government beyond par-
tisanship. He did not drum up votes 
by pitting blue against red, urban 
against rural, white against black. 
He did not use the color of his skin 
to seek the White House as a redress 
for the historical injustice perpe-
trated upon African-Americans by its 
white power structure. Many politi-
cal professionals thought his refusal 
to indulge either of these impulses 
bordered on criminal malpractice.
But Barack Obama had correctly 
perceived one thing: the pragmatic 
millennial wanted to hear how gov-
ernment would better discharge the 
duties of governance in a democratic 
society. 
Furthermore, the millennial 
wanted to hear a sound case for how 
these duties would be discharged. 
They wanted facts and ?gures and 
logical reasoning. To tell them any-
thing else was to step outside the 
dominion of a man seeking the 
presidency. The millennial does not 
see politics as an arena for wag-
ing battles for the soul of a nation. 
Politicians who distort the political 
process to wage such battles will, if 
millennials continue exerting their 
electoral in?uence, become obsolete 
creatures.
Roughly half of all millennials 
today identify themselves as politi-
cally independent. Toughened by the 
ravages of the Great Recession and 
hardened by the War on Terror, these 
millennials do not much care for the 
merits of the free market or the myth 
of American exceptionalism. How-
ever, following the messy rollout of 
Obamacare, they are also aware of 
government’s inef?cacy in discharg-
ing its duties.
Millennials will not be reliably 
Democratic voters, even though they 
voted in record numbers for Barack 
Obama. Future candidates, at every 
level of government, will be well 
served by recognizing the pragmatic 
personality of the millennial gen-
eration, and appealing to it at the 
expense of every other trick in the 
political playbook. The American 
millennial has come of age. It is time 
American politics made room for 
them at the table.
Uncertain if Facebook is reality Oculus needs
BRANDON SCHMUCK 
After raising $2.4 million on 
Kickstarter a year-and-a-half ago, 
Oculus VR is ?nally starting to make 
mainstream virtual reality a reality. 
By utilizing the latest in mobile tech-
nologies, the company’s product, 
the Oculus Rift, will be the ?rst con-
sumer product to combine a unique-
ly immersive experience with a price 
tag realistic for everyday people. 
However, many are both praising 
and condemning this week’s acqui-
sition of Oculus by Facebook, and 
Oculus’s future remains uncertain.
Initially, the Oculus Rift was en-
visioned by its developers to change 
the way people played video games. 
With stereoscopic 3-D, a 1080p 
5-inch OLED display, and six-axis 
head tracking, the Oculus Rift pro-
vides a 360-degree viewing experi-
ence that people are describing as so 
realistic that they forget it is not the 
real world.
While there already exist virtual 
reality products on the market, none 
of them has been a major success, 
due to the fact that high price tags 
barred out most consumers, and 
that a head-movement lag plagued 
many devices and caused motion 
sickness.
However, just as Oculus Rift be-
gan to gain major attention from 
the media, the announcement that 
Facebook had purchased it for $2 
billion began to raise much specula-
tion and concern.
Some game developers even 
withdrew from supporting the Ocu-
lus Rift, showing deep dissatisfac-
tion with the acquisition. Mojang 
owner and Minecraft creator Markus 
Persson announced that he would 
no longer be developing a version 
of his famous video game for Oculus 
Rift because “Facebook creeps [him] 
out.” 
In addition, many Kickstarter 
supporters were angered by this 
acquisition. One Kickstarter user 
named Michael Cooper responded 
with the words that many support-
ers were thinking: “What in hell was 
the point of Kickstarter if you sell out 
to a giant company like Facebook?”
However, while many like to spell 
doom for Oculus Rift and believe 
that Facebook will transform it into 
an ad-blasting 3-D device to display 
an enhanced News Feed, Facebook 
CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees it as 
something much more than anoth-
er gaming platform. He describes 
it as one of the few “candidates to 
be the next major computing plat-
form.” He believes it could revolu-
tionize the way we socialize, stat-
ing that “Oculus has the potential 
to be the most social platform ever. 
Imagine not just sharing moments 
with your friends online but entire 
experiences.”
Personally, I would bet that he 
wishes to somehow create some 
form of immersive video chat, in 
which those communicating could 
have 3-D views of each other’s envi-
ronment. Judging from how he de-
scribes his experience using it, Zuck-
erberg truly believes this product is 
a revolution.
However, media theorist Nathan 
Jurgenson may describe another 
reasonable theory as to why Face-
book is currently on a startup spend-
ing spree, describing it as “conspicu-
ous acquisition.” He states that a 
purchase like this “doesn’t exist to 
make money but is rather a luxury 
prop to demonstrate a certain type 
of corporate status.” As The Guard-
ian describes, Facebook bought 
Oculus for the same reason compa-
nies like Google make products like 
Glass; they want to use them to en-
hance their coolness factor.
The purchase of Oculus Rift has 
an uncertain outcome. In the best-
case scenario, Facebook will use its 
technologies to change the way we 
communicate in a positive manner. 
In the worst-case scenario, Oculus 
will simply become one of Mark 
Zuckerberg’s luxury props, slow 
down virtual reality’s pace of inno-
vation, and eventually be removed 
from the market altogether. 
However, no matter what hap-
pens, we can speculate that the 
Facebook acquisition is a loss for 
the gaming industry. The real ques-
tion now is whether or not it will be 
a gain for communications and be-
come the next computing platform, 
something that could be much more 
revolutionary than a gaming experi-
ence.

Government must honor private contract
KYLE HENSON 
Earlier this week, the Supreme 
Court took up an important case re-
garding the Affordable Care Act re-
quirement detailing that companies 
provide health insurance that covers 
IUD’s and morning-after pills, such 
as Plan B and Ella, to their employ-
ees. Certain privately-owned com-
panies —  such as Hobby Lobby, the 
company bringing the suit before the 
court — have religious owners who 
object to the idea of being forced to 
subsidize actions they believe are 
tantamount to murder. The court is 
now forced to make a decision with 
far-reaching consequences, as a re-
sult of the federal overreach con-
tained in the Affordable Care Act, 
which broaches the sanctity of pri-
vate contracts and puts the federal 
government in charge of tradition-
ally state issues.
No matter what the court de-
cides, there are decidedly negative 
consequences for both decisions. If 
the court decides in favor of the gov-
ernment, then religious freedom is 
clearly compromised. It’s reasonable 
for someone to object to forced sub-
sidization of devices and medication 
that prevent the further development 
of a fertilized egg. There are people 
who hold that all forms of human life 
should be protected, and while they 
shouldn’t be able to prevent others 
from expressing beliefs contrary to 
those they hold, they also shouldn’t 
be forced to subsidize something 
that they think is immoral.
Deciding in favor of the govern-
ment means that people are con-
fronted with the option of either 
compromising their religious beliefs 
or giving up being business owners. 
This forced decision is an unreason-
able affront to religious freedom, 
because being a principled Christian 
is totally reasonable, and protection 
of religious freedom means that reli-
gious beliefs shouldn’t prevent a per-
son from going about their daily life.
On the other hand, deciding in 
favor of Hobby Lobby sets a danger-
ous precedent. This decision would 
allow people or corporations to get 
exemption from the law if they can 
claim a law is an affront on their re-
ligious freedom. Given the obscurity 
and depth of the world of religions, 
it’ll be dif?cult to determine where 
the legitimacy of religious claims 
cuts off, and where people start 
abusing the exemption to just get out 
of complying to laws they don’t like.
Either way the court decides, re-
ligious freedom — a right held near 
and dear to our country’s history 
— or the rule of law — another im-
portant part of our nation’s history, 
though one that the Obama Admin-
istration has made a habit of compro-
mising — hold much less power than 
they once did. Our country once held 
the sanctity of a private contract as 
an implicit right. If I believe that I 
and those around me are rational hu-
man beings, any contract that they 
sign should be their business and not 
mine or the government’s. The gov-
ernment doesn’t know what’s best 
for you — you do. State governments 
can restrict this right because they’re 
given this type of regulatory author-
ity. The federal government has tra-
ditionally had no business messing 
with people’s contracts, and this 
overreach perfectly illustrates why 
any federal intrusion into uncharted 
territory is a slippery slope to abuse.
Intrusion into the sanctity of a 
private contract started with a mini-
mum wage law, which the Supreme 
Court actually declared unconstitu-
tional when it was ?rst introduced 
for this very reason. These intrusions 
have gradually built up, through 
taxes and regulations, until today. All 
of these reforms have been well in-
tentioned, but the increase in federal 
power has led to something like the 
Affordable Care Act being thought to 
be within the scope of what the gov-
ernment can do, putting the court in 
the place it ?nds itself today.
The federal government should 
not violate the sanctity of private 
contracts for any reason or in any 
way. Individuals, not the govern-
ment, are best equipped to make de-
cisions for themselves. If the federal 
government respected this principle, 
the Supreme Court would not ?nd 
itself in a position where either deci-
sion that it renders will signi?cantly 
weaken one of two fundamental pil-
lars of American society.

Opening Day brings excitement, anticipation for fans
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
Opening Day is one of the 
most iconic days in sports. 
America’s pastime marks the 
true beginning of spring and 
signals that summer is just 
around the corner. Baseball’s 
faithful are so passionate that 
several Hall of Famers peti-
tioned Congress earlier this 
year to make Opening Day a 
national holiday. While his-
tory is certainly a huge part of 
baseball, Pittsburgh has more 
immediate reasons to be ex-
cited when the Pirates open 
their season on Monday. This 
season marks the ?rst time in 
over 20 years that the Pirates 
have opened the season com-
ing off a winning season and a 
playoff berth.
Obviously the Pirates want 
to meet and surpass the suc-
cess they had last season, but 
they are still in the tough NL 
Central. Below, I recap the off-
season moves made by each 
team in the division in the or-
der that I predict they are go-
ing to ?nish come September.
St. Louis Cardinals
Given their immaculate 
propensity for constantly 
reloading their roster from 
their minor league system, 
it’s impossible to pick against 
the Cardinals, especially with 
them coming off a World Se-
ries loss to the Boston Red 
Sox. With the massive contri-
butions given by 2013 rookies 
Shelby Miller, Michael Wacha, 
Trevor Rosenthal, Carlos Mar-
tinez and Matt Adams, the 
Cardinals did not have many 
holes they needed to ?ll in free 
agency. 
Their one spot of weak-
ness was at shortstop, where 
Pete Kozma was a defense 
specialist, but a black hole in 
the lineup. Their signing of 
former Detroit Tiger Jhonny 
Peralta hurts them a bit on de-
fense, but turns the shortstop 
position from a weakness to a 
strength from a batting 
perspective.
The Cardinals also did a bit 
of player shuf?ing in hopes of 
shoring up their defense in the 
out?eld. Future Hall of Fame 
out?elder Carlos Beltrán left 
but was easily replaced by top 
prospect Oscar Tavares. 
Tavares is a signi?cant 
defensive upgrade given his 
youth and speed, but he won’t 
be able to ?ll Beltran’s role in 
the lineup. The biggest shift 
was a trade with the Los Ange-
les Angels of Anaheim, which 
sent third baseman David 
Freese to the West Coast in 
exchange for out?elder Peter 
Bourjos. 
The trade allowed former 
second baseman Matt Car-
penter to shift to his natural 
position and speedster Kolten 
Wong to join the major league 
lineup. Bourjos also adds to 
the defensive-minded over-
haul of the out?eld.        
Pittsburgh Pirates
Last year’s playoff team 
was a strange combination 
of emerging youth and wily 
veterans that caught ?re and 
made Pittsburgh care about 
baseball again. With the nota-
ble exception of ace A.J. Bur-
nett, the Pirates are returning 
a near identical team to last 
year. 
Their biggest additions will 
likely come midseason when 
their top prospects, pitcher 
Jameson Taillon and out?eld-
er Gregory Polanco, are both 
expected to make their major 
league debuts.
The biggest worry for the 
Pirates has to be their lineup, 
with traditional hard-hitting 
positions — ?rst base and cor-
ner out?elder — both remain-
ing awkward time shares be-
tween mediocre talents. 
Pittsburgh must be hoping 
the continuing development 
of out?elder Starling Marte 
and third baseman Pedro Ál-
varez boosts the lineup or cen-
ter ?elder Andrew McCutchen 
matches or surpasses his MVP 
season from last year. 
Otherwise, the bullpen bet-
ter be up to the task of holding 
on in close games like they did 
through the stretch last year.
Cincinnati Reds
The Reds did not look good 
coming out of off-season. 
They lost two major pieces of 
their team with leadoff man 
Shin-Soo Choo signing with 
the Texas Rangers and former 
ace Bronson Arroyo moving to 
the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Cincinnati is trying the ?ll 
the holes from within, with 
Tony Cingrani trying to re-
place Arroyo as the rotation 
work horse, and Billy Ham-
ilton likely taking over the 
center ?eld and leadoff spots. 
Hamilton is far and away the 
fastest player in the league, 
but that speed is only useful if 
he is able to get on base.
The biggest positive for the 
Reds was the major statistical 
hit their core took last year, 
with several major contribu-
tors well off their career 
averages. 
Assuming these players 
regress to the norm and ace 
Johnny Cueto comes back 
healthy, the Reds will be in 
good shape, but it’s hard to 
tell if last year was an off-year 
or the start of the decline for 
many of the veteran core play-
ers and pitchers, who rarely 
become less injury-prone as 
time passes. 
If everything clicks, the 
Reds could easily challenge 
for the division, but they could 
just as easily fall out of conten-
tion by August.
Milwaukee Brewers
The Brewers have added 
two major pieces that have the 
potential to be their former all-
star selves or complete busts. 
Pitcher Matt Garza was signed 
after an off-year split between 
the Chicago Cubs and Rang-
ers. It wasn’t that long ago 
that Garza was a perennial Cy 
Young candidate, but the last 
two years have been plagued 
by injuries and inconsistency. 
The second addition never 
really left. Right ?elder Ryan 
Braun, the former MVP, will 
be returning from his season-
ending suspension for per-
formance enhancing drugs. 
There is a lot of speculation 
that Braun’s great stats were 
more representative of the 
drugs than his own perfor-
mance and that he will only be 
a shell of his former self.
The Brewers just have too 
many question marks to com-
pete for a playoff spot, espe-
cially given the three solid 
teams above them in the di-
vision. With a limited minor 
league system, the Brewers 
are stuck in limbo trying to hit 
on old veterans and hoping 
they regain their old sparks. 
Chicago Cubs
No discussion of the base-
ment is complete without the 
lovable losers. The team for-
ever tied with bad luck looks 
to ?nally be on the right path. 
That being said, the best they 
can hope for this season is to 
not ?nish last in the division. 
Former top prospects 
shortstop Starlin Castro and 
?rst baseman Anthony Rizzo 
both had down years last sea-
son, but their youth gives hope 
that it was a sophomore slump 
and not a representation of fu-
ture potential.
This year’s hot in?eld pros-
pect comes in the form of third 
baseman Mike Olt. The center 
piece of the trade that sent 
Garza to the Rangers last year, 
Olt was viewed as the second 
best prospect in the Texas 
system until last year, when 
blurry vision and terrible hit-
ting signi?cantly dropped his 
stock. 
Now, a year after the win-
ter league beaning that was 
likely the cause of his vision 
problems, Olt has made the 
major league roster out of 
spring training and looks to be 
returning to his former self.

Pirates pitchers Francisco Liriano, Jason Grilli, and Gerrit Cole take the ?eld. The Pirates hope to continue their strong performance this season.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Looking back at the best of the NBA at the season’s end
NISHANT RENIWAL
Junior Staffwriter
It’s the end of March, the 
time of year when there are 
fewer than 12 games left for 
each team in the NBA regu-
lar season. Playoff seeding is 
more or less decided, barring 
any major upsets, and teams 
have generally settled into 
a rhythm and developed an 
identity for the season, one 
that they will carry through 
the playoffs. We know who 
the real contenders are and 
who the pretenders are. With 
the conclusion of the season 
close by, this time is as good 
as any to hand out the ma-
jor regular season awards to 
those who deserve them.
Sixth Man of the Year
Rather than starting with 
the big ones ?rst like the MVP, 
we begin from the other side 
of the popularity spectrum. 
The Sixth Man of the Year 
award rewards those players 
whose contributions coming 
off the bench have propelled 
teams forward and signi?-
cantly improved them. Who is 
this year’s best sixth man?
Perennial contender and 
2010 Sixth Man of the Year 
Los Angeles Clippers shoot-
ing guard Jamal Crawford has 
made a case again for himself. 
He is averaging an essential 
18.6 PPG for the Clippers and 
their fast running offense, en-
suring that the team always 
has reliable scoring off the 
bench. Crawford has unques-
tionably been the Clippers’ 
best player and deserves rec-
ognition for it.
Another perennial con-
tender and 2008 Sixth Man of 
the Year, San Antonio Spurs 
shooting guard Manu Ginóbili 
is having a renaissance year. 
Part of the Spurs’ aging Big 
Three (also including for-
ward-center Tim Duncan and 
point guard Tony Parker), it 
was speculated that Ginóbili 
would retire at the end of 
last season after having prob-
ably the worst season of his 
career and being upstaged by 
the likes of Danny Green and 
Kawhi Leonard in the Spurs’ 
rotation. He’s back to being 
himself; despite lower play-
ing time, Ginóbili has been 
incredibly ef?cient and keeps 
rolling on to potentially the 
best record in the NBA.
A surprise contender from 
a pleasantly surprising team 
is Phoenix Suns forward Mar-
kieff Morris. Part of a whole 
roster of improved players, 
Morris stands out for his con-
tributions from the bench. 
Along with his twin brother 
power forward Marcus Mor-
ris, Markieff has carried his 
team’s second unit time and 
again, and has stepped up to 
the cause on several 
occasions.
Winner:
Manu Ginóbili. He’s un-
questionably the best player in 
this conversation, and when 
the Spurs are rolling like this, 
no one else deserves it more.
Most Improved Player
The ?rst major contender 
for this award is Phoenix Suns 
guard Goran Dragic. Dragic 
has been nothing short of 
sensational this season. He 
has carried a Phoenix team 
projected to be at the bottom 
of the Western Conference to 
legitimate playoff contenders. 
With the help of star ac-
quisition point guard Eric 
Bledsoe (who mind you, has 
missed nearly three months 
of action) and coach Jeff Hor-
nacek, the Suns have been 
playing thrilling basketball, 
resembling the Houston Rock-
ets of last season. Much of it is 
down to Dragic though, who 
was snubbed from the All-Star 
Game despite having a career 
year. 
The second contender is 
New Orleans Pelicans for-
ward-center Anthony Davis. 
Such has been Davis’s rise 
this season that he is being 
seen by most coaches to be an 
MVP candidate in the coming 
years. 
Sporting an absurd PER of 
27.10 in just his second year 
in the league and at only 21 
years old, Davis is a star in the 
making. He leads the league 
in blocks and currently aver-
ages over 20 PPG and over 10 
RPG. His PER is also the fourth 
highest in the league behind 
only LeBron James, Kevin Du-
rant, and Kevin Love. Davis is 
a monster in the making, and 
the Pelicans have a franchise 
player on their hands.
Winner
Dragic, only because his 
rise is more surprising. Da-
vis is also destined for bigger 
awards.
Defensive Player of the 
Year
For a while it seemed like 
absolutely no one could stop 
Indiana Pacers center Roy Hib-
bert from taking this award 
home. For the ?rst half of the 
season, Indiana’s defense was 
one of the most suffocating 
seen in years and even Tom 
Thibodeau’s Chicago Bulls 
weren’t keeping up. His rim 
protection is impeccable and 
has been key to Indiana only 
allowing 91.7 PPG this season.
However, a new contender 
has emerged over the recent 
months. Forward-center Joa-
kim Noah has carried the 
Bulls on his sleeve like no one 
thought he could. 
Indiana’s PPG allowed was 
lower than 90 for a while, and 
the Bulls’s PPG allowed higher 
than 93. Its now down to 91.9, 
just 0.2 more than the Pacers. 
Noah has also brought this 
number down pretty much 
alone, as he leads the team 
in rebounding, assists, and 
blocks. And all these statistics 
do not even begin to measure 
the heart with which Noah 
plays.
Winner
 Noah. The Pacers have 
fallen in performance while 
the Bulls have only become 
better, and Noah is the reason 
for that, especially without 
any other star on the team.
Rookie of the Year
In a draft class being com-
pared to the disastrous 2001 
draft, it wouldn’t be too hard 
to stand out with some high 
numbers. And yet there is 
only one player who has 
shown any true potential of 
becoming a superstar: Phila-
delphia 76ers guard Michael 
Carter-Williams (MCW).
 MCW has been very good 
on a 76ers team that just tied 
for the longest losing streak 
in the history of the NBA. But 
even he has his ?aws, notably 
his shooting and high turn-
over rate. But he is averaging 
16.7 PPG, 6.0 RPG and 6.3 
RPG while being sixth in the 
league in steals at 1.92 per 
game. He has major talent, 
but needs a better supporting 
cast and coaching.
Honorable mentions go 
to Orlando Magic shooting 
guard Victor Oladipo and 
Utah Jazz point guard Trey 
Burke.
Winner
MCW. Those numbers 
might be in?ated by pace, but 
are excellent nevertheless.
Coach of the Year
As the Spurs cruise toward 
a potential No. 1 overall seed 
(yet again), Gregg Popovich’s 
name is being thrown around 
as possible coach of the year 
(again). There isn’t much that 
isn’t known about him, and 
he is certainly the best coach 
in the league and in the con-
versation for one of the great-
est ever. He’s also remaining 
steadfast in performance de-
spite the fact that each of the 
Spurs’ Big Three have missed 
rather signi?cant time.
The ?rst surprise con-
tender is Portland Trailblaz-
ers coach Terry Stotts. The 
Trailblazers were not even ex-
pected to be in the conversa-
tion for the playoffs this year, 
but after their 24–5 start, they 
were labeled as potential con-
tenders. While they have fall-
en off their torrid pace since, 
they still are in the ?fth seed, 
and Stotts has been doing all 
he can to squeeze the maxi-
mum out of role players like 
forwards Thomas Robinson 
and Joel Freeland.
The biggest surprise is from 
the most surprising team. Jeff 
Hornacek has coached the 
Suns, which was expected to 
be one of the worst teams, but 
is now one of the most excit-
ing teams. 
Nearly every Suns player is 
having a career year and the 
Desert Cinderellas have made 
a case for themselves to be in 
the contender picture in the 
next few years.
Winner
Hornacek. As good as 
Stotts has been, the Suns are 
just two-and-a-half games be-
hind the Trailblazers, despite 
having a signi?cantly poorer 
roster.
Most Valuable Player
The last two years the MVP 
trophy has been contended 
between Miami Heat small 
forward LeBron James and 
Oklahoma City Thunder small 
forward Kevin Durant. Both 
times Durant has come sec-
ond, with James taking home 
the hardware and taking his 
MVP tally to four. He has be-
gun to establish himself in the 
Greatest NBA Players of all 
Time conversation. However, 
this year may be the one when 
Durant ?nally gets his due.
His defense, frequently 
criticized over the last few 
years, has improved by leaps 
and bounds, Durant has been 
nothing short of sensational.
The race to win this trophy 
is so close, because James has 
been no slouch either. He’s av-
eraging 27 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 
6.4 APG. 
While these might be lower 
than his career averages, its 
because he’s also playing less.Also, all of this has been 
with shooting guard Dwy-
ane Wade in and out of the 
lineup and the Heat having to 
use seldom-used players like 
small forward James Jones 
and guard Toney Douglas in 
place to start. James is carry-
ing the Heat yet again.
Winner
Durant. It has to be him. 
But the race is so close, James 
could still win it if he goes on 
a tear over the next 10 games 
or so.

Men’s and women’s track and ?eld season opens strong
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
On Friday and Saturday, 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s track and ?eld 
teams hosted the Carnegie 
Mellon Mini Invitational at 
Gesling Stadium. Both teams 
performed well as they par-
ticipated in their second meet 
of the outdoor season.
The men’s team contin-
ued its domination, winning 
the meet on the back of their 
strong throwing events. 
Senior Zachary Erra-Her-
nandez continued his suc-
cess, winning the shot put for 
the second consecutive week, 
this time with a 15.75-meter 
throw. 
The Tartans swept the rest 
of the podium with junior 
Gino Pilato and senior Nathan 
Cheek tossing 13.43 and 13.38 
meters, respectively, to take 
second and third.
In discus, the Tartans re-
peated the sweep, this time 
with Cheek winning with a 
42.56-meter toss and Pilato 
and Erra-Hernandez follow-
ing behind with throws of 
42.37 and 42.02 meters, re-
spectively. 
Erra-Hernandez wasn’t 
done and set a new school 
record in the hammer throw 
with a toss of 53.90 meters on 
the way to a second-place 
?nish. 
He broke the previous 
school record of 52.70 meters 
set by Tom Matta back in 2006 
and is now ranked ?fth in the 
nation for the event.
To round out the Tartan’s 
dominance in the ?eld events, 
?rst-year Kyle Weaver won the 
pole vault with a 4.20-meter 
jump, senior David Markowitz 
took home a third-place ?n-
ish in javelin with a throw of 
50.09 meters.
First-year Matthew Seifu 
also earned third place with a 
6.32-meter-long jump.
“The meet [last weekend] 
was really awesome. I really 
didn’t expect to be breaking 
any records this early in the 
season. I really wasn’t expect-
ing such a strong start,” Weav-
er said. 
“This weekend, I wanted 
to break the record again, but 
I didn’t think that I would be-
cause the weather was so bad. 
In fact, I kind of went into it 
not expecting much for that 
reason,” he said. 
Weaver hopes to continue 
his streak for the rest of the 
season. “My coaches are great, 
so I just have to keep jumping 
higher,” Weaver said.
“My personal goals for the 
rest of this season de?nitely 
include qualifying for outdoor 
nationals. And I would love to 
raise the pole vaulting record 
time.”
The track portion of the 
meet still held plenty of op-
portunity for the Tartans, 
starting with a third-place ?n-
ish by junior Elliot Watson in 
the 3,000-meter steeplechase 
with a time of 10:04.88. 
Senior Mike Standish also 
got third in the 800-meter run, 
crossing the line with a time of 
1:58.39.
“I was pleased and sur-
prised with how well I did 
for my ?rst 800 this season,” 
Standish said.
Sophomore Ben Neiman 
grabbed a second-place ?nish 
with a 57.53 run in the 400-me-
ter hurdles. The 4x400-meter 
relay team closed out the meet 
with a win. 
Senior Jerome Reano, ju-
nior Thomas Vandenberg, 
sophomore Marc Daniel-
Julien, and ?rst-year Owen 
Norley ?nished with a time of 
3:25.97.
The women continued 
their theme of the season with 
strong individual performanc-
es, but less-than-stellar team 
showing, as they ?nished in 
fourth at the meet. 
Junior Sasha Spalding was 
one of the bright spots for the 
Tartans, taking home a ?rst- 
place title in the long jump 
with a season best 5.03-me-
ter leap and a third-place and 
career-best shot put of 10.95 
meters.
Two ?rst-years rounded 
out the ?eld event success for 
the Carnegie Mellon women, 
with Rebecca Fortner taking 
second in the high jump with 
a 1.47-meter leap, and Grace 
Yee grabbing third in the pole 
vault.
Junior Hailey Brown 
grabbed the second of three 
Tartan victories, this time in 
the 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
Brown crushed the rest 
of the ?eld, winning by over 
15 seconds with a time of 
12:16.59. 
Junior Halley Bayer ?n-
ished third in the 1,500-meter 
run with a 4:55.55 ?nish and 
?rst-year Ariel Tian crossed 
the line second in the 400-me-
ter run with a time of 1:02.94.
Senior Jacqueline Guevel 
continued to dominate on the 
track with a ?rst place ?n-
ish in the 100-meter hurdles 
and a third place ?nish in the 
400-meter hurdles with times 
of 15.34 and 1:05.65, respec-
tively. Guevel also combined 
with Tian, senior Kelsey Hal-
linen, and ?rst-year Emily 
Swanson to take second in the 
4x400 meter relay with a time 
of 4:21.59.
“We’re really excited for 
this season,” Weaver said. 
“Our team wants to win the 
UAA outdoor conference, and 
with such a strong team, I 
think we can do it.” 
The Tartans next compete 
at home on Saturday in the 
Carnegie Mellon Quad Meet.

Women’s and men’s tennis teams score this weekend
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s tennis 
teams both faced off against 
Washington and Lee Univer-
sity at home on Saturday. 
The games were scheduled 
to be played outside, but were 
shifted inside due to the in-
clement weather.
The ninth-ranked women’s 
team took care of business, 
defeating the 20th-ranked 
Generals. 
The Tartans were in a hole 
after the doubles matches, 
with only junior Angela Pratt 
and ?rst-year Nicholle Tor-
res winning their match 8–4, 
but quickly recovered in the 
singles competition, with only 
Pratt and sophomore Eliza-
beth Martin dropping their 
matches. 
First-year Vanessa Pavia 
and senior Katie Cecil both 
won in straight sets 6–0, 6–3 
and 6–1, 6–2 respectively, 
while Torres and sophomore 
Brooke Tsu both dropped 
their ?rst sets 4–6 before bat-
tling back to win.
The 11th-ranked men also 
triumphed over 22nd-ranked 
Washington and Lee. 
Similar to the women, the 
men quickly fell behind with 
only ?rst-year Kiril Kirkov 
and sophomore Joel Lankford 
winning their doubles match, 
8–3. 
The men then rallied, just 
like the women, and won ?ve 
of the six singles matches 
with the only loss coming in 
three sets by junior Will 
Duncan.
Sophomores Abhishek 
Alla, Kirkov, ?rst-years Kenny 
Zheng, and Kunal Wadwani 
all won in straight sets, none 
giving up more than three 
games in a single set; Wad-
wani only dropped one game 
on his way to victory. 
Junior Christian Heaney-
Secord had a harder time, 
eventually winning in three 
sets after dropping the sec-
ond one on tiebreak, 6–3,6–7, 
7–9, and 6–1.
Both teams face off against 
Grove City on Friday at Grove 
City College.

Mac Demarco is growing up
Salad Days keeps old attitudes, but adds perspective
Montreal native Mac Demarco, one of the unique 
and off-kilter personalities in indie rock, has released 
a followup to his breakthrough 2012 record, 2, and it 
shows an emotional and musical maturity that many 
never saw coming. Made available for free streaming 
last Sunday on the National Public Radio website 
and set to be officially released on Tuesday, Salad 
Days gives us a Demarco that has invested more of 
himself into his art than ever before, and the results 
are commendable.
Recorded mostly in Demarco’s home in Brooklyn, 
Salad Days features jangly, surf-pop-inspired guitars 
and bass lines akin to other indie favorites such as 
Real Estate. The production is also very stark and 
gives the songs a sense of immediacy; you really 
feel as if you’re sitting on the floor while Demarco is 
singing to you from the edge of his bed.
Running throughout the album are themes of 
growing up, living life in one’s own way, and a fear 
of loss. “Goodbye Weekend” serves as a “kids are 
alright”-style PSA to a skeptic that may have good 
reason to be concerned, but with an attitude that 
declares that it’s not their life so they should just 
shut up. Album opener “Salad Days” scoffs at those 
who tell Demarco to “act your age” and who act as if 
his “life is already over.”
Demarco’s sound is a mix of pop, indie, and surf that 
sounds innocent on the surface, until you listen to 
the accpmpanying lyrics. Radio-ready single “Let 
Her Go” pairs mopey lyrics with a sunshiny, 60s 
pop melody and instrumentation. The results are a 
breakup song that would make a great soundtrack 
for a drive along the beach.
One thing that makes Salad Days such a significant 
departure from Demarco’s previous work is how 
much more personal he’s allowed his songwriting to 
become.
“Passing Out Pieces” is mediation on his newfound 
fame and the experiences — good and bad — that 
have made him who he is today. “It’s all I’ve seen 
that can’t be wiped clean / It’s hard to believe what 
it’s made of me.”
“Let My Baby Stay” adds childlike glockenspiels to a 
tender and blissful love song full of fear. As Demarco 
explained in an interview with Pitchfork, the song 
was inspired by his longtime girlfriend Kiera, who 
lives with him in Brooklyn without a visa.. 
He said in the interview that “Her ability to enter 
and exit the States is threatened, so that’s a stress 
for me, and it’s pretty much all my fault.” The song 
acts as a desperate plea to an unknown force, and 
it’s a request you can’t help but wish you could 
grant.
One of the greatest stock characters in music is 
the “Peter Pan”-like voice of youth; the rock star 
that won’t grow up no matter how much you try 
to make him. Those characters give those of us 
who’ve yielded to the unstoppable flow of human 
maturation a hope that — if we really wanted to 
— we could just spend our days like we were 16 
forever and do absolutely nothing with no possible 
consequence. The problem with these characters is 
that they’re not human, so ultimately, we can only 
relate to them in limited respects. Demarco was the 
embodiment of this character, but with Salad Days 
he has progressed as a serious artist. He proves with 
this album that he is actually human, and I can’t 
wait to watch him grow even more.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Matt and Ryan,
There is one sound that 
no one knows: What does 
the fox say?
Sincerely,
Habitually About The 
Egregious Exaggerations 
Holding Opulence
Dear HATEE-HO
For the love of a bald and 
terrified mathematician, how 
should I know?
Speaking of which, if we 
examine W. Kroniker’s 
seminal work, entitled 
Smoothness on Co-
Symmetric Right-Completely 
Null Paths, we will find 
every semi-characteristic, 
free, quasi-combinatorially 
canonical triangle is locally 
minimal. It is then trivial to 
show that the Riemann 
hypothesis holds, and 
that pi is smaller than e. 
By continuity, the sub-
composite and quasi-almost 
surely differentiable path is 
isomorphic.
Recently, there has been 
much interest in the 
derivation of numbers, which 
is beyond the scope of this 
review. Therefore, in future 
work, we plan to address 
questions of naturality as 
well as neutrality.
It’s your karma,
Matt & Ryan
Dear Ryan and Matt,
OMIGAWD you guys 
are seriously so hot like 
even though I’ve never 
seen you in person I 
just like know you’re

should like get together 
for drinks or something 
and you just see where it 
goes or whatever! Like I 
don’t even know how to 
explain myself, but it’s a 
total personality thing, 
you know? I can just like 
tell from your writing 
that you’re hilarious and 
so cute and amazingly 
charming and ugh! I 
mean you totally don’t 
have to feel pressured or 
anything, because that’s 
like the LAST thing I want, 
but ohmigod, if we could 
just hang out, I’m like 
300% sure that we’ll hit it 
off, if only because you’re 
so sexy when you write

So hit me up, fellas. I’m

If you happened to be exploring the empty streets of 
North Braddock Avenue last weekend, you may have 
come across an old warehouse, its brick walls splashed 
with graf?ti. Inside this building, if you were to walk 
through its cavernous rooms to take the lift to the fourth 
?oor, you may have then come across a strange sight: 
a large white oblong box with silvery string curtains 
hanging along its sides.
This was not some black monolith from a race of 
intergalactic higher beings; rather, it was the set of the 
School of Drama’s production of The Glass Menagerie, 
one of American playwright Tennessee Williams’ 
most renowned plays. The Glass Menagerie, based 
on Williams’ own youth and family life, is an intimate 
glimpse into the insanity of the dysfunctional Wing?eld 
family, and it is this insanity that stood at the front 
and center of the production. Directed by John Wells 
directing program fellow Michelle Sutherland, the 
production revealed in the abstract that although the 
dialogue and characters maintained the original script 
and were grounded and realistic enough, everything else 
in the production was a stark departure from reality, to 
offer us “truth in disguise of illusion.”
Senior acting major Claire Chapelli played Amanda, a 
faded southern belle who becomes a poor single mother 
after her husband leaves her. Chapelli, who also co-wrote 
the original music for the production, brought a brilliant 
performance that evoked both revulsion and sympathy. 
Senior acting major Joe Mendick played Tom, the sole 
provider of the family who longs to escape his job at 
a shoe warehouse and become a poet. Senior acting 
major Sarah-Nicole Robles played Laura Wing?eld, a 
painfully shy girl of 24 who is content to live in her world 
of Victrola records and glass animals. Senior acting 
major Carl Lundstedt played the gentleman caller, Jim 
O’Connor, a guest who is invited by the Wing?elds in the 
expectation that he will take a liking to Laura.
As for the choreography of actors, each character 
had their own distinctive poses and movements. For 
example, Amanda Wing?eld, the mother, snapped 
with both hands, and her son Tom often made motions 
as if he were drawing a bow at his mother. The 
actors constantly moved about each other in circular 
movements; in quarrels and heated engagements, they 
frantically twirled around each other. Conversations 
involved bizarre rituals in which a pair of shoes were 
moved about, hands were raised and then abruptly 
slapped down again, and there was much pacing back 
and forth.
The bizarreness of these rituals were only further 
highlighted when a visitor came to the family’s home 
and, like a tourist in a foreign city, tried to navigate his 
way through their social conventions. Like the audience, 
his confusion was apparent as he accidentally disrupted 
the family’s rituals and failed in trying to emulate them.
These movements, which had to seem natural but 
sharply distinctive, added an extra dimension of 
dif?culty in terms of acting, but the actors pulled them 
off incredibly well.
The aforementioned stage — white frame, pink ?oor, 
and string curtains — contained only a few set pieces 
and felt vast and empty, yet at the same time restrictive 
and prisonlike. Watching the action on stage from the 
audience felt like looking into a large aquarium. The 
curtains along the side of the stage doubled as a screen 
that projected images and live recordings from two 
cameras along the sides of the box. The Glass Menagerie 
was originally written with such a screen to be used 
in the play, but many productions often leave out the 
screen, deeming it unnecessary or pretentious. However, 
the School of Drama’s production put it at the forefront 
of attention. The way the stage was built, the entirety of 
the play took place behind the curtain, within the box. 
The curtain-screen was used to great symbolic, as well 
as practical, effect.
The screen aided in transitions and created momentary 
distractions during the course of the play. The actors 
sometimes traced their ?ngers on the curtain as they 
walked along the sides of the box, disrupting the 
vertical serenity of the curtain strings, and sometimes 
they brushed it aside, peeking out into the audience. 
However, the screen was used most effectively when 
it was used to project close-ups of the actors’ faces, 
which created a more intimate setting and allowed 
the audience to see the actors’ expressions better. The 
screen was also often used to build atmosphere. During 
the ?nal act of the play, when all the other lights were 
dimmed, the screen became lit up by sparkles of light, 
creating a momentary feeling of magic.
Interestingly enough, the production seemed to draw 
in?uences from Japanese theater in its use of auditory 
cues to heighten drama, as well as the exaggerated 
movements and poses of the actors.
Throughout the production, bells, ominous chimes, 
whistles, and the crash of broken glass sounded through 
the performance area. The production also made use of 
musical sequences, in which the actors sang before the 
cameras. Psychedelic music and imagery were used 
in these sequences to offer a look into the characters’ 
mental states.
The School of Drama production brought a distinctive 
?avor and energy to an already incredible play. At times 
brilliant, disturbing, funny, and always deeply rooted 
within a world of its own, The Glass Menagerie was truly 
a unique experience to behold.

French students revolt in downtown Pittsburgh
Les Misérables features pristine voices, a gripping narrative, and Carnegie Mellon actors
Do you hear the people sing? In the Pittsburgh Musical 
Theater’s production of Les Misérables, the answer 
is a resounding “yes!” The diverse cast of this classic 
musical put on a spectacular show that would put the 
stars of the recent movie production to shame.
For those unfamiliar with the story, Les Misérables is 
set in France during the failed 1832 June Rebellion and 
follows the story of Jean Valjean (Peter Matthew Smith) 
who, after serving 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of 
bread, creates a new identity and a new life for himself. 
Years later, he encounters Fantine (Emily Lynne Miller), 
a dying woman using any means necessary to provide 
for her child, Cosette (Kate Toole), and he agrees to take 
care of the child and raise her as his own. Meanwhile, 
Javert (Brady Patsy), a policeman with a strict moral 
code, is after Valjean for violating his parole. And the 
whole time all of these characters are interacting, the 
people of France are organizing a revolution.
While it may seem redundant to cite the music as the 
best part of the musical, the vocals are absolutely what 
stand out most about this performance. There are very 
few lines of spoken dialogue in the show; the entire 
story is told in song. The cast members not only provide 
the entertainment of beautiful, strong voices, but also 
convey the characters’ personalities and emotional 
struggles through their songs. The stars’ voices are 
especially mind-blowing.
Another remarkable aspect of this production is the 
cast itself. Performers range from children studying at 
performing arts academies, to college students from 
several different universities, to Broadway performers, 
to professional ?lm actors, and even an award-winning 
cartoonist. If diversity is indeed the spice of life, perhaps 
the wide range of backgrounds from the different cast 
members is part of what makes this performance so 
fantastic.
One particular star in this production is Tim Hartman, 
who plays the sticky-?ngered, drunken innkeeper, 
Master Thenardier. Hartman is a native Pittsburgher and 
is known for his work on Broadway. He has also made 
his appearance on the silver screen in ?lms including 
The Silence of the Lambs, The Mothman Prophecies, 
The Piano Lesson, and the highly anticipated adaptation 
of the John Green novel that was ?lmed right in 
Pittsburgh’s backyard, The Fault in Our Stars. Hartman’s 
expressive face and tall, lanky ?gure de?nitely lend 
themselves to his comedic role. In an otherwise quite 
somber story, Hartman and his counterpart, Victoria 
English, who plays his equally nasty wife, offer moments 
of comedic relief.
Among the cast members are two Tartans: Emily Carr 
and Donovan Smith. Smith, a senior vocal performance 
major, lends his beautiful, operatic vocals to the 
character Enjorlas, one of the leaders of the revolution. 
Carr, a sophomore vocal performance major, brings life 
and passion to her role as a female factory worker. She is 
also the understudy for Fantine.
When it comes to vocals, however, there are four 
particularly outstanding performances: those of Peter 
Matthew Smith, Patsy, Victoria Buchtan, and David 
Toole.
Smith (Valjean), Toole (Marius), and Patsy (Javert) are 
all professionals in the creative arts and entertainment 
industry. Smith has performed on Broadway and worked 
with the Pittsburgh CLO and Pittsburgh Musical 
Theater in numerous productions. His vocal range is an 
outstanding portrayal of Valjean that even rivals that of 
Hugh Jackman.
Toole also has many productions with the Pittsburgh 
Musical Theater and Pittsburgh CLO under his belt. His 
voice rallies the people of France into revolution in one 
scene and in the next declares his love for Cosette, who, 
interestingly, was played by his real-life wife Kate Toole. 
His voice is simply beautiful.
Patsy offers a stark contrast to the voices of both Smith 
and Toole with his deep, booming vocals. He has
more of a hand in the future generations of performers. 
He is a creative arts administrator at the Propel 
PITCAIRN charter school in Monroeville and a 
performing arts teacher at the Richard E. Rauh 
Conservatory for the performing arts.
Buchtan (Eponine), on the other hand, is a sophomore 
at Robert Morris University double majoring in 
communication and theater. Her voice can hardly 
be described as anything less than perfect — clear, 
beautiful, and deeply connected to the emotions of 
her character. Her rendering of unrequited love evokes 
sympathy and has the ability to even draw tears from the 
audience.
Of course, the performance is not without its faults. 
There was an obvious case of opening-night jitters 
among many of the cast members on March 27 — some 
forgot words or even entire verses to songs. While die-
hard Les Mis fans would have de?nitely noticed, those 
not particularly familiar with the musical probably would 
not have, and still would have enjoyed the musical 
despite the ?aws.
Les Misérables runs at the Byham Theater through 
April 6.

Patterned pants are a trend that have been in style for 
quite a while now, yet most people continue to be wary 
of them. Though patterned pants can be slightly more 
challenging to style than solid colors, choosing what to 
wear with them should become a breeze after reading 
this article. All you need is a couple of tips and tricks 
on what you should and shouldn’t wear with patterned 
pants to ensure that you look cool and unique, but not 
like you belong to the circus.
Colored jeans fall under the category of patterned pants, 
and they’re considered an important spring staple for 
many. Choosing the right color is the ?rst step before you 
consider styling them. Mint green, pale blue, and coral 
are common colors of jeans that people tend to wear in 
the spring and summer. They’re also good for dressing 
in-season on days that are slightly colder. These jeans 
can be worn with a variety of tops, including pretty ?oral 
tanks and blouses, or a crisp white shirt for a slightly 
more professional look. These colored jeans would also 
look good with light sweaters in cream or beige. In terms 
of shoes, colored jeans look great with ballet ?ats, a 
classic example of spring footwear.
Printed pants in general are also very fashion-forward for 
spring. The ?oral pattern is a common choice for printed 
pants. Pairing ?oral pants with a solid top containing 
one of the colors that the pants have in them is a great 
choice. For example, if the ?owers that are part of the 
?oral pattern have purple, pink, and blue ?owers in them, 
wear a nice blouse in the same shade of purple (or pink, 
or blue) to highlight that color. This rule applies even if 
the print on the pants isn’t ?oral. Usually, the pants will 
be white with a pattern or black with a pattern, so it 
would look better to wear a colored top rather than a top 
in a neutral color.
The shape of the printed pants is also important. Take, 
for instance, the bohemian corduroy pants at Free 
People. These wide-legged pants are especially hard 
to pull off but can still be attempted by those who are 
willing to take risks in fashion. Due to their shape, they 
look better with ?tted tops. Add layered necklaces or 
other bohemian accessories to accessorize and create 
a complete look. Free People also has skinny printed 
corduroy pants that can be paired with a billowy top in a 
neutral color.
Harem pants have also recently come into style and are 
great for summer because they’re light and comfortable. 
They always have unique prints and are found in bright 
colors as well. Wear them with casual T-shirts or tank 
tops in neutral colors, and choose either sandals or short 
ankle boots for footwear.
These pants should also be differentiated from printed 
leggings. While patterned pants give a more dressed-up 
look and should be worn when you want to look put-
together, wear patterned leggings for something more 
casual. Leggings come in the widest assortment of 
patterns, but it is necessary to sort the good from the 
bad. Some patterned leggings can be found in a strange, 
sheer and shiny pattern, which should be avoided since 
they’ll probably be somewhat see-through as well. Floral 
leggings — as in the case of pants — are the most 
common. However, these should be paired with a neutral 
tunic or baggy T-shirt with a light, modest pattern on it. 
Other patterns of leggings can be found, ranging from 
tribal prints to geometric prints. Note that the printed 
leggings should be worn with longer, baggy tops; these 
tops need to have designs that do not clash with the 
patterns on the leggings.
There are a lot of ways to wear printed pants, especially 
because of the range in styles in which they’re available. 
As a result, there’s no need for the idea of printed pants 
to scare you from trying this trend. Printed pants have 
been in style for quite a while now, so it’s time for you to 
join the trend!

American Hustle
Saturday, April 5

Written and directed by David O’Russell, American Hustle is a kooky take on the 
FBI’s Abscam operation during the late 1970s and 80s. Bronx-born con artist 
Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) are 
forced to work under the guide of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) in a 
political bribe sting. It shouldn’t be surprising that another David O’Russell ?lm has 
generated magni?cent performances from its ensemble cast, with Jennifer Lawrence 
in particular, shining as Rosenfeld’s nagging wife. While American Hustle is a crime 
comedy that explores the world of corruption, it is essentially a love story set in the 
gaudiest era of our time.

Miller Gallery opened its doors last Friday evening to 
viewers wanting a ?rst glimpse of the 2014 MFA thesis 
exhibition, Lossless. This year’s collection featured 
the work of three master’s of ?ne arts students — Carl 
Bajandas, Oreen Cohen, and Yun Mi Her — and spanned 
a wide spectrum of moods, media, and subjects.
The exhibit represents a culmination of the artists’ work 
as ?ne arts students — yet each artist went further by 
“exploring new territory,” according to School of Art head 
John Carson in a Miller Gallery press release.
For each of the three artists, this new territory took 
them in different directions, leading to a cohesive, yet 
pleasantly diverse ?nal exhibition.
Carl Bajandas
When viewers step onto the third ?oor of the gallery, 
Bajandas’s large-scale piece — titled “Loss / Decay / 
Recovery” — is easily the ?rst thing they’ll see: The 
work spans the entire center room. It’s a colorful arched 
canvas with a gritty, sparkly texture overtop.
Bajandas achieved this effect by creating a solution of 
copper sulfate crystals in water. As the water evaporates, 
the solution will continually crystallize over a three-
month period, forming the sugary texture on the surface 
of the canvas.
As the solution crystallizes, the copper oxidizes. As a 
result, the canvas is discolored in places, showing runny 
brown and green splotches overtop the original vibrant 
aqua base.
Once viewers look past the looming canvas, though, 
they’ll notice a persistent, monotone hum that pervades 
the space. No, it isn’t the air conditioning; it’s part of 
the art itself. Bajandas positioned a small computer at 
the ceiling of the room that registers the darkness of the 
discolored canvas and emanates a noise accordingly.
At ?rst, the hum is loud and somewhat bothersome, but 
eventually it blends into the natural sound scape of the 
space. Slowly, it takes on a hypnotic effect.
“It’s supposed to be a very calm, meditative piece,” 
Bajandas said.
Since the oxidation is a three-month process, both the 
colorscape and the soundscape will evolve over the 
course of the exhibition — and Bajandas wants viewers 
to engage with this feature of the piece.
“The reaction happens so slowly, and it’s supposed to 
push the time scale outside the human attention span,” 
Bajandas explained. “It has to be something you come 
back to and look at again and sort of sit with.”
The crowded, chatty atmosphere of opening night 
might not have been conducive to the contemplative 
environment Bajandas was hoping for the piece. But it’s 
easy to imagine revisiting the gallery on a quieter day: 
approaching the vast, larger-than-life canvas, listening 
to the whirs and hums of the changing soundscape, and 
looking for hidden patterns in the landscape of crystals.
Oreen Cohen
By contrast to the soothing hum of Bajandas’s piece, it’s 
quite the opposite experience walking into the center 
backroom on the second ?oor. There, projected video 
clips jump from wall to wall in brief ?ashes, forcing 
viewers to whirl around at every sudden change.
Some of these snapshots depict peaceful, wintry scenes: 
close shots of withering, frost-covered sun?owers and 
sun?ower seeds falling in slow motion onto snowy soil. 
Others show workers pounding into the earth, lowering a 
mysterious gold-painted casket into a grave.
And all the while, it’s hard to know where to look next, 
causing viewers to crane their necks to look around the 
room from every angle.
The experience is disorienting — but that’s the point, 
according to artist Cohen. Her thesis project, “Between a 
Stone and a Shrine,” focuses on current efforts in nearby 
Braddock, Pa., to bring life back to a fading community. 
The choppy, whirlwind presentation of the videos plays 
a role in the narrative Cohen hopes to tell about the 
Braddock project.
One scene shows a bulldozer eating away at a 
demolished house, digging into the house’s innards 
while what remains of the siding of the house ?ops 
lifelessly.
“When a building is demolished, everything is sort 
of fragmented,” Cohen explained. “Our sense of 
environment — our environment that we’re used to — is 
totally disoriented.”

Miller Gallery exhibit features multi-sensory work across various mediums that range from calm meditation to fragmented chaos
Attendees are given the chance to participate in the 
art in a portion of Yun Mi Her’s segment of Lossless.

image projected onto a screen on the other side of 
the gallery.

That’s the driving motif behind the jarring presentation 
of the video — the fragmented nature of what’s 
happening in Braddock. As Cohen describes it, she’s 
“trying to capture a narrative through multiple screens.”
Ultimately, Cohen hopes to provoke viewers to “look 
at abandoned spaces with a different perspective.” 
In ?nding her place as an artist amid the efforts in 
Braddock, Cohen wants to turn gentri?cation into 
revitalization. As the artist put it, “I wanted to take a 
space and turn it into a place” — a place with identity, 
character, and humanity.
Yun Mi Her
Also on the second ?oor, Her’s work is a tonal marriage 
of her colleagues’ pieces. Like Cohen, Her’s work relies 
on video: she captures her subjects with hypnotic, 
emotional interviews.
Viewers can watch Her’s interviews by clambering into 
hollow rectangular prisms made of balsa wood: They’re 
suspended vertically from the ceiling by taut strings, at 
just the right height for viewers to duck underneath.
Once inside these prisms, viewers are secluded from 
the rest of the exhibit, left to gaze at the screen before 
them. On these screens, video interviews play in loops, 
portraying a variety of subjects discussing everything 
from their childhoods to the de?nition of a successful life. 
The camera captures the subjects head-on, thought it 
will often zoom in on subjects’ eyes, mouths, and hands.
Like Cohen’s videos, Her’s work is fragmented and 
puzzling: It jumps between the moments in an interview, 
rather than playing them chronologically, forcing viewers 
to paint a narrative out of snapshots. But at the same 
time, the effect is calming and thought provoking: 
Viewers wander at their own pace from one prism to the 
next, moving from story to story.
Her’s work continues upstairs — and there, the mood 
is different. Instead of merely watching images on a 
screen, here viewers get to take part in them. In two 
enclosed rooms on opposite sides of the ?oor, a lone 
chair stands in the center of each of the spaces, facing 
a video camera. Viewers take turns sitting in this chair, 
looking and waving into the camera.
The trick to the piece lies in the projected image on a 
wall in each room — a live video recording of the chair 
in the opposite room, and any of that chair’s inhabitants. 
Every blink, wave, and move by each subject in the chair 
is instantly broadcast on the opposite side of the gallery 
?oor.
The setup might not seem so out of the ordinary, but it’s 
somewhat unsettling. Imagine a Skype session without 
the little box in the upper corner re?ecting your own face 
back at you.“They can see each other,” Her explained, 
“but they can’t see themselves.”
Although you might not guess it, according to Her, 
the third-?oor installation is a symbolic realization of 
the videos downstairs. Her didn’t elaborate on what 
those symbols were, but it’s possible to imagine that 
the interview subjects and the gallery visitors have 
something in common: Both are facing cameras, 
unable to see themselves yet visible to others. Both ?nd 
themselves in vulnerable situations, shedding some layer 
of self-consciousness in the process and showing their 
un?ltered selves to an unseen audience.
Lossless isn’t an exhibit for the visitor who’s in a rush. 
At face value, Cohen’s work might seem like a mismatch 
of beautifully captured, but random snapshots. Without 
context, viewers might fail to ?nd meaning in the 
colorful crystals of Bajandas’ oxidizing canvas. If you 
plan to make the trip, take the time to wander the space; 
watch the interviews; read the placards on the walls. 
meaningful for it.Artists of Lossless
Carl Bajandas — Carl employs different unique methods of pro-
duction with each project, creating a very diverse set of works. 
Loss / Recovery / Decay “explores entropy and our relationship 
to change.”
Oreen Cohen — Oreen works primarily in sculpture and video. 
Her art is driven by “unpacking the embedded meanings, histo-
ries, and identities of place” and attempts to “cultivate social alle-
gories that re-interpret the past, solidify the present, and antici-
pate the future.”
Yun Mi Her — Yun Mi focuses primarily in video and other forms 
of interactive art to “explore the daily internal conflict of individual 
lives.” Her videos range from depictions of incidental encounters 
to in-depth interviews that hope to convey “not only the empti-
ness, loneliness, but also the hope and satisfaction that occur in 
the cycle of one’s daily life.”

What does race mean to you? Is it something real, 
something that de?nes us and our biological history? 
Or is it a social construct, created by others to de?ne 
how they see us in order to organize society into 
narrow structures?
At the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, a 
nationally touring exhibition titled “Race: Are We 
So Different?” explores race in the United States as 
an evolving, complex issue. The exhibit is a project 
of the American Anthropological Association and 
Science Museum of Minnesota, and funded in 
part by the National Science Foundation and Ford 
Foundation.
The exhibit combines biological, cultural, and 
historical points of view to tell a story about what 
race really means — and why it’s less rooted in 
science and more rooted in society. Rather than 
focusing on any single perspective on race, the show 
was curated to weave together ideas about race 
from the dawn of the nation to the present, while 
making explicit connections to current problems 
impacted by our skewed understanding of race. The 
exhibit sought to generate and guide discussion 
in the room, providing broad theoretical questions 
rather than answers. These prompts ranged from 
“Can you talk to your friends about race?” to “Does 
where we come from tell us who we are?”
Education, healthcare, voting, economic inequality, 
and home ownership were among the key issues 
explored.
Most compelling about the exhibition was the use of 
visuals, such as archival photography, documentary 
videos, and interactive maps, complemented by 
persuasive and slightly shocking statistics.
Just 100 years ago, much of Western philosophy 
believed that race was the indicator that all people 
are inherently unequal, and pointed to biological 
differences as evidence. Yet while the “science” 
of racial inequality has largely been discarded, the 
philosophy, politics, and ideology based on such 
ideas remain at the core framework of American 
society.
With clear community-oriented objectives, the 
Carnegie Museum supplemented the core exhibit 
with a local section on the history of race in 
Pittsburgh through a comparison of photojournalism 
from the 1950s to the present. A city rich with 
working-class and racial history, Pittsburgh remains 
one of the most segregated cities: African-American 
communities and white communities are almost 
entirely separated from one another. The exhibit 
aimed to deepen conversation within the city 
on the impacts of racial inequality. A gallery talk 
Saturday morning invited Pittsburgh’s diverse 
community to join the curators of the photographic 
exhibit to discuss what they found when they asked 
Pittsburgh residents, “How would you describe race 
relations in Pittsburgh?”
In many ways, Carnegie Mellon is a diverse campus 
with students from around the world. While only 
11 percent of students are African-American, 
Hispanic, or Native American, another 15 percent 
are international, and students and faculty alike 
tend to perceive the campus as diverse. Yet this 
diversity should not diminish the importance of 
understanding that whether we individually feel it all 
the time or not, de?ning race is very much a critical 
issue in understanding the United States and the 
world in the 21st century.
Powerfully presented, this exhibition demonstrates 
that by expanding the conversation on race to 
talk about inequality and prejudice in general, it 
becomes possible to get past our own limited sense 
of identity and move toward a global understanding 
of race.

Horoscopes
aries
march 21–april 19
Mashed Potato Smoothies: Check your dessert. Someone 
might have changed your vanilla caramel smoothie for some 
mashed potatoes and gravy.
taurus
april 20–may 20
Socks Closed Halfway: Are feet suddenly too big to fit 
your socks? Maybe it’s your socks that have changed and 
not your feet. Check if someone has sewn them halfway 
closed.
gemini
may 21–june 21
Broken TV: First place to check is old-tape-over-the-sensor 
trick. If someone puts tape over your remote sensor, the TV 
will magically break.
cancer
june 22–july 22
Colored Water: Looks like you’re an unlucky victim to a 
few dye pellets. Unscrew the cap to the faucet and check 
inside. There’s bound to be a few dye pellets changing the 
color of your water.
leo
july 23–aug. 22 
Wacky Mouse: Your mouse suddenly decides to stop 
listening to you. Seems like someone has changed the 
settings to go just the opposite of where you want. 
Unfortunately, you’ll have to find a way to navigate and 
change it back.
virgo
aug. 23–sept. 22
Screenshot: This is one of the more confusing pranks to 
figure out. If your phone isn’t responding, maybe the “icons” 
on your screen are just pictures. Someone probably took a 
screenshot of your phone and used it as the background. 
How tricky.
libra
sept. 23–oct. 22
Jelly Drink: No matter how hard you try, the juice in the 
glass won’t budge. That’s because it’s actually a large 
chunk of Jell-O with a straw stuck through it.
scorpio
oct. 23–nov. 21
Polished Soap: You tried again and again, but for some 
reason the soap seems ... broken? It won’t produce 
bubbles, so maybe someone painted your soap with nail 
polish  — that prevents soap from lathering.
sagittarius
nov. 22–dec. 21
Balloon Toilet: Check first before you use the toilet next 
time. Make sure no one stuck a helium balloon in there.
capricorn
dec. 22–jan. 19
Taped Horn: Open doors softly from now on. There might 
just be an air horn taped onto the wall behind the door.
aquarius
jan. 20–feb. 18
Candied Onions: Don’t bite before you check! If someone 
hands you a “candy apple,” it may actually be a 
caramelized onion in disguise. Gross. 
pisces
feb. 19–march 20
Explosive Cake: Why are you receiving a cake when it’s not 
your birthday? Make sure there’s not actually a balloon in 
there. You wouldn’t want a sugary mess when you try to 
cut the cake.Maryyann Landlord | Comics Editor
