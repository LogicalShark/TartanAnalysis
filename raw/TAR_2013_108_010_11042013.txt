Pittsburgh’s 2013 mayoral elec-
tion between Democrat nominee 
Bill Peduto and Republican nominee 
Josh Wander takes place tomorrow.
Current mayor Luke Ravenstahl, 
announced his decision not to run 
for re-election last March, and has 
become less and less prominent in 
his role as mayor since then.
Ravenstahl’s path toward leav-
ing the of?ce has been speckled 
with controversy. Two weeks ago, 
Ravenstahl tweeted messages about 
his legacy from his home and from 
a nearby country club during the 
workday. 
Ravenstahl has been criticized 
for being aloof and absent ever since 
he withdrew from the race.
Ravenstahl is also known to 
have unfriendly political ties with 
Peduto; according to the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review, during the primary 
race Ravenstahl allegedly used cam-
paign money after he drew out of 
the race to air advertisements criti-
cal of Peduto. 
Peter Masters steps down from SBVP role

News Co-Editors 
Peter Masters, junior in-
ternational relations and 
politics and philosophy dou-
ble major, resigned from his 
position as student body vice 
president for the fall semes-
ter, citing personal reasons.
Masters said that he needs 
to “take a step back and take 
care of [himself] a little bit.” 
He will be taking a leave 
of absence for the spring 
semester.
“I wholeheartedly sup-
port Masters’s decision to 
step down and understand 
that while he was doing great 
work for the student body, 
this was absolutely the best 
decision for him to make,” 
said Lindsay MacGillivray, 
senior biology major and 
student body president. “His 
resignation does not in any 
way re?ect the work that he 
did while in the role, and I 
know that he will still be able 
to stay engaged with students 
on campus.”
“Peter Masters did a won-
derful job in his position as 
VP. His creativity paired with 
his extensive prior experi-
ence with student govern-
ment on campus, made him 
an excellent candidate for 
the VP position, and he was 
working on many different 
projects that would bene?t 
the student body in a number 
of ways,” she continued.
As student body vice presi-
dent, Masters was in the pro-
cess of spearheading several 
campus initiatives, including 
improvements in dining and 
outdoor study spaces. Mas-
ters is working on creating 
a “Carnegie Mellon survival 
guide” that gives tips on how 
to succeed at Carnegie Mel-
lon to ?rst-year students. 
“One of the biggest things 
I am personally passionate 
about is dining here,” Mas-
ters said in an interview. “A 
big thing for me was creat-
ing an allergen-free location 
and having more late night 
options, since a lot of CMU 
students seem to stay up for-
ever.”
Masters, although he is 
resigning, will continue sup-
porting these causes. “VP is 
really just a title, and these 
are all things that I’m very 
passionate about and will 
continue working on,” Mas-
ters said.
Following Masters’s resig-
nation, MacGillivray began 
the search for someone to 
ful?ll his role. According to 
MacGillivray, she tentatively 
plans to appoint junior elec-
trical and computer engi-
neering major and student 
government cabinet member 
Ian Glasner as Masters’s re-
placement, pending approval 
from Student Senate and the 
Graduate Student Assembly. 
According to the student gov-
ernment constitution, which 
can be viewed online at www.
cmu.edu/stugov/policies, 
if “the [student body vice 
president] position becomes 
vacant, the president may 
appoint a member of the 
student body to ?ll the posi-
tion. Either Student Senate 
or the Graduate Student As-
sembly (GSA) may reject this 
appointment by way of two-
thirds supermajority vote at 
a regular meeting of student 
senate or the graduate stu-
dent assembly, respectively.”
“Since the position is 
now an appointed position, 
I used different networks of 
students to solicit sugges-
tions for new vice president 
candidates, speci?cally Sen-
ate, GSA, and my cabinet. 
After receiving different 
suggestions from students, I 
interviewed four different ex-
cellent candidates for the po-
sition and ultimately decided 
that Ian Glasner would be my 
appointment,” MacGillivray 
said.
Glasner is currently a 
community adviser in the 
Residence on Fifth, a mem-
ber of MacGillivray’s student 
government cabinet, a broth-

Colin Powell speaks on value of diplomacy
BRENT HEARD
Staffwriter
Former Secretary of State 
Colin Powell spoke at the 
Carnegie Music Hall last 
Tuesday at an event hosted 
by the American Middle East 
Institute. 
The talk was titled “Diplo-
macy: Persuasion, Trust and 
Values,” and Powell devoted 
his time to addressing his four 
Es: the economy, energy, the 
environment, and education.
Powell was born to Jamai-
can immigrants in Harlem  
and went on to become a four-
star general in the military. 
In 1987, Powell was selected 
to serve as President Ronald 
Reagan’s national security ad-
viser, and then served as the 
chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff for Presidents George 
H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton 
before being appointed as sec-
retary of state for President 
George W. Bush.
The event drew a consid-
erable audience, nearly ?ll-
ing the venue. Simin Curtis, 
the president and CEO of the 
American Middle East Insti-
tute, opened the event. 
Powell’s speech was the 
conclusion to a day-long busi-
ness conference on energy 
and water hosted by the Insti-
tute. Numerous Middle East-
ern dignitaries attended the 
event, including former Egyp-
tian ministers, Libyan Deputy 
Minister of Oil and Gas Abdul-
bari Arousi, as well as what 
Curtis described as “the crème 
de la crème of American CEOs 
[of] water and renewable en-
ergy [companies].”
Pennsylvania Governor 
Tom Corbett introduced Pow-
ell and remarked that “The 
tradition of the soldier-states-
man dates back to George 
Washington,” referencing 
Powell’s military service, and 
after reading quotes from 
Powell’s writings and inter-
views, added, “Powell is an 
emblem of what America does 
well.”
Powell then took the stage, 
complimenting the American 
Middle East Institute, saying, 
“They understand the impor-
tance of understanding cul-
tures of different people in 
different parts of the world.”
He spoke of the value of 
economic activity in Middle 
Eastern development, remark-
ing, “When you think about 
what happens in the Middle 
East, it’s not just about wars 
and con?icts.” Powell recalled 
anecdotes from his diplomatic 
experience, highlighting the 
desire for jobs and work in 
that area of the world.
Powell praised the value 
of “the creation of wealth, 
not that just goes to the top 
of the pile, but that brings us 
up from poverty,” recalling 
when he toured China shortly 
after the Cultural Revolution. 
“I could see that these people 
wanted a better life,” he said.
“What does it take to in-
dustrialize? Energy.” Powell 
added that in the near future, 
“energy will be so in demand 
that anything that can be pro-
duced will ?nd a market.”
Powell spoke favorably of 
natural gas extraction from 
Pennsylvania’s Marcellus 
Shale deposits, claiming that 
shale gas put the state “in a 
unique position to supply en-
ergy.” He added, “but we must 
do this in a way not to destroy 
the environment.”
Powell spoke of how Penn-
sylvania’s economy used to 
rely on petrochemicals and 
manufacturing, but has im-
proved its environmental con-
ditions. “It’s now education 
and medicine here in Pitts-
burgh more than manufactur-
ing.”
Drawing on his modest 
background when speaking 
about education, Powell said, 
“It isn’t where you start in life, 
it’s where you end up.”
Powell admitted that he 
did not have the best high 
school grades, but “I went to 
school and college without it 
costing my parents a dime.” 
He praised the decision 
of New York tax payers to 
choose to fund the education 
of low-income students, add-
ing “I think every community 
in America should make that 
kind of commitment to educa-
tion in America.”
He continued, “We need 
to educate our youngsters for 
a different kind of economy: 
a more sophisticated one, 
where education matters now 
more than it ever did before.”
Powell also went on to 
share some personal stories 
throughout his time on stage. 
“I have to be candid with you,” 
he began, “at this point in my 
life and career I’m just glad to

College Board releases annual reports tuition and ?nancial aid 
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Co-Editor
The College Board recently 
released its annual Trends in 
College Pricing report, which 
shows the increase in tuition, 
fees, and room and board at 
U.S. institutions of higher edu-
cation. The report examines 
how the prices of both public 
and private institutions in the 
U.S. have ?uctuated in recent 
years.
The Trends in College Pric-
ing report measures college 
tuition by several different 
metrics, including published 
price — the price a college 
or university gives — and net 
price, which, according to the 
College Board, is the “pub-
lished price minus the grant 
aid that students receive.”
The College Board notes 
in the online version of the 
Trends in College Pricing re-
port that “net prices are fre-
quently much lower than pub-
lished prices and represent 
the amount students actually 
pay.”
According to the report, 
the average cost of out-of-
state and in-state tuition, fees, 
room, and board for public, 
four-year colleges went up 
3.2 percent within the past 
year. For private, nonpro?t, 
four-year institutions — which 
include Carnegie Mellon  — 
prices rose 3.7 percent.
While the national average 
net price for private, nonpro?t, 
four-year colleges increased in 
line with total sticker price, ?-
nancial aid — as measured by 
both federal and private loans 
and grants — has decreased in 
the past year.
According to the College 
Board’s 2013 Trends in Stu-
dent Aid report, released in 
conjunction with the Trends 
in College Pricing report, to-
tal national average aid in 
the 2011–12 academic year 
was $15,696; in 2012–13 it 
decreased $163 to $15,533. 
These ?gures include national 
averages for several forms of 
aid, ranging from private stu-
dent loans to subsidized and 
unsubsidized federal loans 
and education tax bene?ts.
This year’s percent increase 
in college tuition is the low-
est it has been since the mid 
1970s. College tuition and 
fees, however, are still rising 
faster than U.S. in?ation. The 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
is a tool used by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics to mea-
sure in?ation; according to 
the Bureau’s website, the CPI 
program “produces monthly 
data on changes in the prices 
paid by urban consumers for a 
representative basket of goods 
and services.”
The CPI increased from 
230.79 in May 2012 to 
232.945 in August 2013, an 
increase of about 1 percent. 
This is signi?cantly lower than 
the increase in college price 
reported by the College Board.
At the beginning of every 
spring semester, Carnegie 
Mellon announces the tuition 
and fees for the upcoming aca-
demic year. 
In February, a campus-wide 
email sent out by Vice Presi-
dent for Campus Affairs Mi-
chael Murphy announced that 
there would be a 4 percent in-
crease in new undergraduate 
tuition rates and a 3 percent

The creative writing de-
partment will welcome Kevin 
Gonzalez and Lauren Shapiro 
to Carnegie Mellon and Pitts-
burgh with a special reading 
on Nov. 12 at 4:30 p.m.
Gonzalez is a Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus who re-
ceived bachelor’s degrees in 
creative writing and interna-
tional relations. 
Shapiro has degrees from 
Brown University and Iowa 
Writers’ Workshop.
 The two will join a 
decorated group of poets 
and writers in the English 
department.
Currently at Carnegie Mel-
lon, Gonzalez teaches Begin-
ning Fiction Workshop and 
Beginning Poetry Workshop. 
Gonzalez  has written a 
poetry collection, Cultural 
Studies, and  is currently writ-
ing a novel.
 Gonzalez’s novel has had 
excerpts published in Play-
boy, Narrative magazine, Best 
New American Voices, and 
Best American Nonrequired 
Reading.
Shapiro, experienced in 
book editing, publishing, and 
literary translation, wrote a 
book, Easy Math, which won 
the Kathryn A. Morton Prize.
According to a press re-
lease, Gonzalez said, “I feel 
extremely fortunate to have 
been able to return to CMU’s 
Creative Writing Program as 
a faculty member. My expe-
rience as an undergrad here 
undoubtedly shaped me in 
many ways, as a writer, an ed-
itor, and even as a teacher. Al-
though writing itself is a soli-
tary act, I ?nd that I, and most 
writers that I know, work best 
when part of a thriving liter-
ary community. The program 
at CMU is unparalleled, as 
far as undergraduate cre-
ative writing programs go, 
in building a strong sense of 
community between students 
and faculty.”

Lower wealth leads to higher risk of colds according to CMU researchers
Lower socioeconomic 
status in childhood and 
adolescence makes aging 
individuals more prone to 
disease, according to the 
?ndings of Carnegie Mellon 
researchers. 
The study, published in 
Brain, Behavior and Immu-
nity, shows that children and 
adolescents go on to have 
shorter telomeres, biomark-
ers of age in a cell’s DNA 
that naturally get shorter 
with age. Shorter telomeres 
eventually cease to func-
tion, causing the cell to die. 
Shorter telomeres are also 
connected to cardiovascular 
disease and cancer, among 
other diseases and health 
problems.
Sheldon Cohen, the Rob-
ert E. Doherty Professor of 
Psychology at Carnegie Mel-
lon, and his team took 152 
healthy volunteers between 
ages 18–55 and measured 
their white blood cell telo-
mere lengths. 
To judge socioeconomic 
status, the researchers had 
participants report whether 
they owned a home and 
whether their parents owned 
the family home during their 
childhood. Participants were 
exposed to a rhinovirus, 
which often starts a cold, 
and were quarantined ?ve 
days to determine whether 
they had an upper respira-
tory infection. Less wealthy 
participants had shorter 
telomere lengths compared 
to their peers. For every year 
a participant’s parent did not 
own a home, their telomeres 
were on average 5 percent 
shorter than their peers’.
According to a press re-
lease, Cohen said, “We have 
found initial evidence for 
a biological explanation of 
the importance of childhood 
experiences on adult health. 
The association we found 
in young and midlife adults 
suggests why those raised 
by parents of relatively low 
socioeconomic status may be 
at increased risk for disease 
throughout adulthood.”

Points of Discussion
Senators have not been 
very interested in events 
hosted by the Internal Devel-
opment Committee this se-
mester, so Senate discussed 
methods for getting mem-
beres to attend such events. 
Senate agreed that the events 
themselves don’t matter as 
much as actually getting Sen-
ators to attend. One sugges-
tion was a Senate Christmas 
party. 
The Academic Affairs 
Committee is looking to cre-
ate a set of guidelines outlin-
ing a level of decorum and 
common courtesy for stu-
dents. These would not be 
strictly enforced rules, but a 
set of community standards.  
Academic Affairs is looking 
for ideas about what to in-
clude in these guidelines.
The campus life commit-
tee tabled on Wednesday and 
Friday in front of Doherty Hall 
and successfully distributed 500 
cookies and 32 gallons of cider 
for free to the student body. 
Tazza D’Oro, who sponsored 
the event by providing the cider, 
was pleased with the outcome.

because they violated the organizations “decency and respect” clause. Freeman was hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Center for the Arts in Society.

be anywhere.”
He described that leaving 
his position as secretary of 
state was a dif?cult transition. 
“I’ve been out of government 
for a few years, but I still think 
about it,” and jokingly offered 
the advice, “If anyone else 
in this room has any kind of 
dif?culty in their 70s, buy a 
Corvette.”
In addition to a new car 
and several major lifestyle 
changes, Powell said, “I’m 
probably as busy now as I ever 
was. It’s just a different kind 
of busy,” describing his speak-
ing tours and work in venture 
capital.
His speech then turned 
to current events, with Pow-
ell emphatically warning, “I 
don’t want to get into an ar-
gument about Obamacare. 
I don’t know enough about 
it. I have socialized medicine 
from the military and I’m 
happy with it. But we need to 
make sure everyone has ac-
cess,” continuing on to say it 
was unacceptable that a coun-
try as wealthy as the United 
States had people without 
some kind of access to health 
care.
Powell then addressed 
Congressional gridlock and 
political polarization. “What I 
say to my friends in Congress 
is you guys are in big trouble 
now,” he said. 
He stressed the impor-
tance of compromise, refer-
encing the extreme compro-
mises in the Constitutional 
Convention, “They even had 
to compromise on the awful, 
horrible issue of slavery.”
“If they could sit there for 
just a few weeks and come 
out with our Constitution, 
tell me why Congress can’t sit 
there and compromise on a 
budget.”
He continued to be critical 
of government spending, and 
Congressmen “not realizing 
the books have to balance.”
Powell revealed that he 
now only watches foreign 
news sources, and criticized 
the polarization caused by 
networks such as FOX and 
MSNBC. He concluded his 
remarks on Congress by say-
ing, “When I was young I saw 
leaders in Congress then. 
There aren’t any now.”
Powell told some illustra-
tive stories about leadership 
and organizational manage-
ment, and also addressed the 
current state of American se-
curity. “We are no longer in 
the kind of danger we were 
before 9/11, but we need to 
maintain our safety without 
showing the rest of the world 
that we’re scared,” adding, 
“We can’t let that happen or 
the terrorists win.”
Questions submitted prior 
to the event asked Powell of 
his opinions on the National 
Security Agency (NSA) spy-
ing scandal and Iraq, amongs 
other topics.
On the NSA, Powell said, 
“We have a great capability 
in the NSA and other security 
organizations. Sometimes we 
need to listen in on our allies. 
But this will come back our 
way,” adding, “You’d have to 
make quite a case to me, if I 
were still in government, on 
why we need to listen in on 
Angela Merkel’s cell phone.”
Addressing whether Iraq 
is better off than in 2003, 
Powell responded, “Yes, it no 
longer has Saddam Hussein 
terrorizing its people.”
Powell concluded his talk 
with some general remarks 
about America’s place in the 
world. “We’re still number 
one, but in a different kind 
of way. We have to be under-
standing.” With respect to 
con?icts such as those in Syr-
ia and Egypt, Powell advised, 
“America should not believe 
we have a magic solution for 
these problems.” He added 
that “we not interfere un-
til other countries are ready 
to receive it.”
Powell referenced his par-
ents’ immigration to America, 
and told stories about his 
encounters with immigrant 
workers in America. “As long 
as we remain an open coun-
try… we will continue to lead 
this world that wants to be 
free.”

National average college tuition risesPittsburgh mayoral candidate breakdown
increase for current students 
for the 2013–14 year.
Over the past 10 years, the 
university has consistently 
increased tuition by between 
$1,000 and $3,000 each year. 
For an incoming, full-
time, resident student in 
2006, tuition was $41,608. 
Full-time resident students 
entering in 2013 had a tuition 
of $46,670. 
This ?gure does not in-
clude room and board and 
other fees.
This ?gure is in line with 
many of Carnegie Mellon’s 
peer institutions. Washing-
ton University in St. Louis, for 
example, charges $42,500 
for tuition alone. According 
to an article in Wash. U.’s  
Newsroom, this is a 3.8 per-
cent increase from the previ-
ous year.
At New York University, 
tuition for an undergraduate 
student entering the College 
of Arts and Sciences in 2013 
was $42,472. 
At the University of Roch-
ester, according to their 
website, tuition increased 
3.9 percent from $42,890 to 
$44,580 for the current aca-
demic year.
Regarding ?nancial aid, 
the university reports that it

Center receives $4.6 million to improve transit app
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
When most people hear “Ti-
ramisu,” they think of the deli-
cious, coffee-?avored pastry. 
But it turns out that tiramisu 
is actually Italian for “pick-
me-up,” which is why Carn-
egie Mellon’s Rehabilitation 
Engineering Research Center 
(RERC) on Accessible Pub-
lic Transportation developed 
a bus rider information app 
called Tiramisu Transit with a 
$4.6 million, ?ve-year grant. 
This grant has recently been 
renewed, giving the research-
ers and their collaborators at 
the University at Buffalo, The 
State University of New York 
(UB) an additional ?ve years 
to continue their research on 
accessible transportation.
At any given time, there are 
about 15–20 different RERCs 
around the country focusing 
on different topics. They are 
funded from within the Na-
tional Institute on Disability 
and Rehabilitation Research 
(NIDRR), a research and de-
velopment unit in the Of?ce 
of Special Education and Re-
habilitative Services, which 
is within the Department of 
Education.
“Some of the RERCs are 
on things that are really tra-
ditional to the whole issue of 
education, you know — work-
place accommodations, sys-
tems to help with augmented 
communication, projects re-
lated to blindness and deaf-
ness — that sort of thing,” said 
Aaron Steinfeld, the principal 
investigator of the accessible 
transportation RERC and asso-
ciate research professor in the 
Robotics Institute. He works in 
the Quality of Life Technology 
Center (QoLT) at Carnegie 
Mellon. So where does trans-
portation come in?
According to the Depart-
ment of Education, the main 
mission of all RERCs is “to 
solve rehabilitation problems 
and remove environmental 
barriers.” Accessible transpor-
tation is a key component to 
achieving this mission because 
all effort spent on educating 
individuals with disabilities 
and improving their work-
place environments is useless 
if they cannot go to school or 
work in the ?rst place. 
“Our focus is very much 
skewed towards independent 
mobility around your commu-
nity. We’re heavily focused on 
public transit and getting to 
public transit,” Steinfeld said. 
Their focus on public transit 
is due to how expensive the 
alternative, paratransit, tends 
to be.
The collaboration between 
Carnegie Mellon and UB 
brings together a very inter-
disciplinary group of research-
ers. The Carnegie Mellon team 
consists mainly of people in 
the Robotics Institute, the 
Human-Computer Interac-
tion Institute, the Institute for 
Software Research, and some 
members from the School of 
Design. On the other hand, the 
team at UB — which is actual-
ly led by Steinfeld’s father, Ed-
ward Steinfeld — consists of 
people in architecture, design, 
and industrial engineering.
Tiramisu Transit, a rider 
information app that was de-
veloped during the ?rst ?ve-
year RERC, is a good example 
of this mixture of computer 
science and universal design. 
The app utilizes crowdsourc-
ing to gather information such 
as when and where buses are 
and how full they are. “Most 
of the people who use it don’t 
realize that the design of Ti-
ramisu and the information 
we’re attempting to gather 
with it is information that is 
really critical for people with 
disabilities,” Steinfeld said. 
This is the basis of univer-
sal design. “By packaging it in 
a way that makes the informa-
tion appealing and valuable 
to everybody, we lead to more 
people using it and greater op-
portunities for the system to 
sustain itself beyond research 
and development,” he said.
While all riders are inter-
ested in knowing when a bus 
will come or how full it will 
be, this type of information 
is particularly important for 
riders with disabilities. For 
example, someone in a wheel-
chair would only be able to 
ride a bus with fewer riders. 
More generally, this app will 
also help those who cannot 
wait outside for long periods 
of time due to potential crime 
in the area or poor weather 
conditions and want to know 
when the next bus will come.
Another success that came 
out of the ?rst ?ve-year grant 
is that prior to it, the Port Au-
thority of Allegheny County 
did not have the ability to 
track buses. While they had 
GPS on some of the buses, 
they were unable to communi-
cate that location back to the 
servers and then share the lo-
cation to the public. As part of 
the RERC, the Port Authority 
tested this capability on one 
of its routes and will be aiming 
to extend it to the rest of the 
agency.
“In the next ?ve years, we 
will use Tiramisu to explore 
certain research questions re-
lated to the impact of this in-
formation on people with dis-
abilities,” Steinfeld said. They 
are also in the process of add-
ing dialogue capability within 
the app so that people will be 
able to attach messages to spe-
ci?c buses and stops. 
Other plans for the new 
RERC include working with 
the Traf?c21 program at Carn-
egie Mellon to combine Tira-
misu with real-time optimiza-
tion of paratransit systems and 
working with the researchers 
who developed NavPal, which 
helps blind people navigate 
through Pittsburgh.

Brainwashing and thought 
control have had an impact 
on a variety of people and cul-
tures throughout history, and 
can be traced all the way back 
to the fourth century BCE.
Brainwashing is the process 
of forcing people to funda-
mentally change their beliefs. 
Despite the fact that brain-
washing is an age-old idea, it 
has taken on a new meaning in 
today’s society with advance-
ments in neuroscience: Scien-
tists are now able to — at least 
partially — understand brain-
washing techniques and their 
effects.
A person’s brain is not ?xed 
but is continually changing, 
sometimes in imperceptable 
ways. In the past, people as-
sumed that once they mature, 
their brains — and thus their 
identities — could not dramat-
ically change.
According to Kathleen Tay-
lor in her book Brainwashing: 
The Science of Thought Con-
trol, this older theory gener-
ally did not support the idea 
of brainwashing, as it would 
require people’s identities to 
completely shatter in order  
to work. Recently, however, 
it has become clear that the 
brain constantly takes in in-
formation and alters the way it 
functions.
The brain, along with all   
the nerves in the body, is made 
of cells called neurons that are 
capable of sending signals to 
each other. Each of these neu-
rons receives a multitude of 
signals that help develop one’s 
personality and perceptions of 
the world. 
Neurons can then further 
send off signals in response to 
those they receive. Through 
analyzing past input and out-
put signals, the brain can pre-
dict the immediate future and 
then compare its prediction 
with what actually occurs. In 
this way, the brain learns from 
the past and more accurately 
understands how to react to 
stimuli.
One of the main implica-
tions of this view of the brain 
is the ability of one person to 
have more than one persona. 
The brain changes and reacts 
differently to different situa-
tions, so a person accordingly 
reacts differently in different 
circumstances. 
For example, the way 
someone acts in a job inter-
view is generally very differ-
ent from the way that person 
acts at home. These different 
personae are often called sche-
mata, and are only activated 
under certain circumstances. 
This means that a person can 
have dormant schemata, and 
that they can create new ones. 
The presence of multiple sche-
mata makes the idea of brain-
washing much more plausible. 
In order to be brainwashed, a 
person only needs to have a 
dormant schema activated or 
have a new schema created, 
rather than have their entire 
persona modi?ed.
Schemata can also refer to 
the brain’s recognition of cer-
tain objects. Both the input 
and output signals in a neuron 
are extremely speci?c, mean-
ing that the representation of 
a single object in the brain is 
created by a group of neurons, 
not by any single neuron. As 
a person experiences an ob-
ject, they develop a schema 
for that object. This schema 
includes everything related 
to the object, including visual 
appearance, sounds, related 
emotions, and related actions.
Now the question becomes, 
how is the strength of the sche-
mata determined? The more 
these schemata activate, the 
stronger they become. This 
explains why people become 
used to things that they ex-
perience on a regular basis. 
In order for brainwashing to 
occur, the relative strength of 
the schemata must be altered. 
This is done by manipulating a 
person’s emotions, their brain’s 
aptitude for change and stress, 
and their prefrontal cortex.
Taylor explains that evolu-
tionary biologists believe emo-
tion is used for survival, and is 
meant to suf?ce when there is 
not time to fully process infor-
mation. Because of this, emo-
tion is generally not coupled 
with logical reasoning. This 
has the potential to lead peo-
ple to strengthen schemata 
that they do not generally ac-
tivate.
The brain’s aptitude for 
change and stress can also af-
fect schemata. Neurons work 
best when they receive var-
ied stimuli, and can become 
dormant otherwise. When 
a person is initially stressed, 
neurons recognize the change 
and become more alert. When 
stress persists, however, the 
neurons become overworked 
and ignore incoming signals. 
Because of this, people are 
more likely to abandon their 
preferred schemata when un-
der stress.
Finally, the prefrontal cor-
tex (PFC) can affect schemata. 
The PFC is the part of the brain 
that allows a person to stop 
and think before acting. Taylor 
says that the PFC shuts down 
when it is activated and then 
overstimulated with informa-
tion. Once the PFC has shut 
down, a person is no longer 
able to think before acting, 
which can lead to the accep-
tance of a previously disap-
proved schema.
The science of brainwash-
ing is a topic that is inextrica-
bly linked to many aspects of 
our society, including the in-
tegration of technology in so-
ciety and advertisement, and 
could greatly affect the way 
society functions as we learn 
more about the way the brain 
operates.Michael Setzer/SciTech Editor

Startup develops 3-D printer for consumer market
Pirate3D, a startup in 
Singapore, is developing an 
inexpensive 3-D printer for 
the consumer market that is 
scheduled to be sold start-
ing in December. The printer 
will be available online and 
at certain retail outlets. It will 
be displayed at the Consumer 
Electronics Show in Las Ve-
gas in January. The printer 
is available in both black and 
white and color, but not much 
detail is available yet on how 
it works.
The company also hopes 
to pro?t by creating ways for 
independent developers to 
sell software and designs for 
3-D printers. The company 
was able to raise $1.4 million 
on KickStarter in less than 
one month, which according 
to co-founder Roger Chang 
should last for the next year. 
The printers will sell for $700 
in stores and $500 online.

Antarctic ?sh reserve receives frigid reception
Negotiations held in Aus-
tralia regarding the creation 
of a 500,000-square-mile ma-
rine reserve in the waters off  
Antarctica failed this week. 
The reserve was proposed by 
the United States and New 
Zealand, and was to be built 
in the Southern Ocean around 
Antarctica. Though the area’s 
ecosystem helps sustain thou-
sands of species, the construc-
tion of the reserve faced oppo-
sition by China, Ukraine, and 
Russia due to concern that it 
would cut off their ?sh stocks 
and undermine their ?shing 
industries. Aquatic life in Ant-
arctic waters account for 10 
percent of the ?sh population, 
and a number of these scien-
tists urge taking measures to 
protect them. China indicated 
that it may be open to a future 
agreement, while Russia and 
Ukraine still question justi?-
cation for the reserve.

Students develop device to stop school shootings
A group of students from 
Benjamin Banneker Academic 
High School in Washington, 
D.C. have attempted to ad-
dress the prevention of school  
shootings. The 10-student 
team, led by math teacher 
John Mahoney, developed 
DeadStop, an inexpensive, 
lightweight device that clasps 
onto the hinges of classroom 
doors to stop intruders from 
breaking into classrooms. 
Due to school safety regula-
tions, schools cannot have 
doors which lock from the 
inside. DeadStop would be 
stored in the teacher’s desk, 
and would be clasped onto 
the door as soon as a warning 
of an armed intruder was is-
sued. The group hopes to pat-
ent the device and have it cost 
no more than $15.

Scientists aim to stop development of ‘superbugs’
According to a study con-
ducted last month by the 
Centers for Disease Control, 
antibiotics continue to be 
overused and overprescribed. 
This has contributed to the 
development of “superbugs.” 
In fact, a recent epidemic 
at the National Institutes of 
Health took six months to 
control.  Despite this, phar-
maceutical companies have 
scaled down research into 
the production of new infec-
tion-?ghting drugs due to 
the narrow pro?t margin. As 
a result, the Department of 
Health committed to provide 
the pharmaceutical company 
GlaxoSmithKline up to $200 
million over the next ?ve 
years for research.

Robots becoming more human-like and autonomous
Recent scienti?c efforts 
aim to enable robots to begin 
collaborating with humans 
and operating without di-
rect human control. Current 
goals in the ?eld of robotics 
include making robots more 
“human shaped” to enable 
them to more gracefully ma-
neuver human environments, 
and developing algorithms to 
make robots more aware of 
their environments and less 
dependent on direct control.
Researchers at the Georgia 
Institute of Technology have 
developed a robot which can 
sense forces on its arm and 
ultimately may serve as an aid 
for physical therapy patients.

Study shows video games improve various functions
According to a study con-
ducted at Max Planck Insti-
tute for Human Development 
and Charité University Medi-
cine St. Hedwig-Krankenhaus 
in Berlin, playing video games 
can enhance brain functions 
such as memory formation, 
strategic planning, spatial 
orientation, and ?ne motor 
skills. The study involved two 
groups: One played video 
games for 30 minutes a day 
for two months, and the con-
trol group did not play any 
games. An increase in brain 
matter — speci?cally in the 
right hippocampus, right pre-
frontal cortex and the cerebel-
lum — was observed in those 
who played video games.

Head injuries should be treated seriously
In a report released this week, 
the NFL concluded that high school 
students are twice as likely to suf-
fer brain injuries as college students 
when playing football. Concussions 
are often treated as frequent occur-
rences, expected side effects of play-
ing sports or engaging in physical ac-
tivity. However, most students fail to 
realize that concussions are serious 
medical conditions that are treated 
far too lightly and can have signi?-
cant impacts on one’s academic per-
formance, not only in high school, 
but also in college.
According to Mayo Clinic, a con-
cussion is a traumatic brain injury 
that can cause headaches, loss of 
concentration, and dif?culties with 
memory, judgment, and coordina-
tion. Concussions occur when the 
brain shifts within the skull. As 
documented by Medical News Today, 
effects from concussions can last up 
to decades after the incident if the 
injury is severe enough.
This information is cause for con-
cern, as many concussions happen to 
high school students whose brains 
are still developing. Silive.com re-
ported that approximately 502,000 
people between the ages of 8 and 19 
were admitted to emergency rooms 
with concussions between 2001 and 
2005, and half of these were attrib-
uted to sports. More shockingly, the 
American College of Sports Medi-
cine documents 300,000 sports- 
and recreation-related concussions 
in the U.S. each year, but estimates 
that this number may be seven times 
greater in reality, as many concus-
sions are never reported.
The brain trauma associated with 
concussions can have serious im-
plications, especially for those with 
developing brains. Many people 
who have concussions say that their 
cognitive performance suffers. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention documented a case in which 
a student reported that it “actually 
hurt to think” after a concussion. 
These injuries have negative impacts 
on learning and school performance, 
which can have a long-term impact 
on student’s success and well-being. 
Effects of concussions can last weeks 
after symptoms disappear, and men-
tal exertion can worsen these effects, 
according to The Wall Street Journal. 
For high school and college students 
who suffer concussions, the injury 
can mean less-than-optimal academ-
ic performance in the weeks follow-
ing the injury.
People need to be more aware 
of the effects of concussions and 
consider taking further steps to pro-
tect athletes from injuries that can 
negatively impact their academic 
futures. Generally, students who suf-
fer concussions should not mentally 
exert themselves too much in the 
weeks following their injury. They 
must consider that the effects may 
last long after the initial injury and 
should not attempt to resume their 
normal strenuous academic sched-
ules until they have given the brain 
ample time to recover.
Electronic cigarettes need to be regulated
Two weeks ago, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Student Senate hosted its third 
annual Student Senate week. Free 
cupcakes, drawstring bags, water 
bottles, and sunglasses were all part 
of the festivities and were appreci-
ated by the student body. However, 
Student Senate could have more ef-
fectively directed attention to their 
causes. The free gifts were enjoyed, 
but there was a lack of connection 
between the Student Senate’s pres-
ence on campus this week and its is-
sues and causes.
This year’s Student Senate week 
came in the wake of a particularly 
successful week last year, when the 
event was highly advertised and 
the student body engaged with its 
Senate representatives. Last year’s 
week was focused on what Student 
Senate could do for the students 
that it represents. College represen-
tatives sent emails to the students 
within their colleges, introducing 
themselves and inviting students 
to provide input on Student Senate 
initiatives. The emails showed the 
Student Senate’s strong attempts to 
connect with students. This year, no 
such emails were sent out, and such 
efforts haven’t been easily visible.
The Tartan appreciates the give-
aways that Student Senate provided 
this year — what college student 
doesn’t like cookies and cider? — but 
the outreach provided last year was 
sorely missed this year. While Stu-
dent Senate representatives talked 
to students at the tables, they did not 
seem to promote their initiatives as 
well as last year’s Senators.
Though free giveaways are a great 
way to increase visibility of any orga-
nization on campus, they can also 
be coordinated with the goals and 
interests of that organization more 
effectively. Student Senate promotes 
a wide variety of talks that are both 
interesting and relevant to campus 
life. The Tartan would have liked to 
see Student Senate consistently pro-
mote its relevant talks during these 
giveaways, particularly their weekly 
Student Senate meetings, which are 
open to the student body.
If Student Senate wants to in-
crease its visibility and presence on 
campus, it needs to pair the atten-
tion-grabbing giveaways with pro-
motions of their other campus ini-
tiatives. Hopefully, Student Senate 
week will use and build upon 2012’s 
Student Senate week as a model 
for planning future Student Senate 
weeks.
Little outreach during Student Senate week
Boycott of Sochi games will not develop diversity
JUSTIN YAN 
Russian President Vladimir Putin 
stated last Tuesday that LGBT ath-
letes would be welcome to compete 
at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. 
This announcement came after Pu-
tin passed a law in Russia that pro-
hibits people from distributing infor-
mation to minors that acknowledges 
same-sex relationships. Foreigners 
are held accountable under this law 
and are subject to ?nes, detainment, 
or deportation. Many U.S. citizens 
called to boycott the Olympics after 
the law passed. While Putin made 
a quick turnaround by stating that 
LGBT foreigners and athletes would 
not be made to feel uneasy, many 
people are still calling for boycotts.
The reasons behind boycotting 
are admirable and agreeable, but 
boycotts are ultimately not useful 
and ?awed in logic. The Olympic 
Games, or any international sport-
ing events, are based around coop-
eration and diversity. To boycott — 
even if it is because the host country 
does not champion these two ideals 
— would be to take away the co-
operation and diversity promoted 
during the games. However, it is 
still crucial to question why Russia 
has the stage for one of the world’s 
most important sporting events. 
The Olympic spirit is about equality. 
Diversity — whether it is based on 
race, sexuality, or gender — should 
not be frowned upon, but embraced.
Picking a country like Russia 
makes no sense in light of the Olym-
pic spirit. One of Russia’s most cel-
ebrated athletes, twice gold-medal 
pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, said 
in August about Putin’s anti-gay law: 
“If we allow to promote and do all 
this stuff on the street, we are very 
afraid about our nation because we 
consider ourselves like normal, stan-
dard people.” She later retracted her 
comments, saying that her poor Eng-
lish was responsible for the state-
ment, according to The Guardian. 
Moreover, FIFA has given Russia 
the chance to host the World Cup. 
Just a week ago, during a match 
against an English soccer team, 
CSKA Moscow, a Russian soccer 
club, was penalized by the Union 
of European Football Associations 
— the European soccer governing-
body — because fans hurtled racial 
slurs at a black player on the ?eld, 
according to The New York Times. 
Russia has a patchy equal rights 
record when it comes to race and 
sexuality, yet boycotting the games 
in Russia would do nothing to pro-
mote equality or diversity in the face 
of this rocky record.
Russia’s citizens are actually very 
liberal — more liberal than the av-
erage American gives them credit 
for. They support abortion based on 
the woman’s choice and, according 
to The New Republic, premarital sex 
and single parenthood are common, 
very much like Western European 
secular cultures, even though most 
of the population still identi?es as 
Russian Orthodox. Its unique reli-
gious identity is where Russia dif-
fers from the rest of Europe and 
where the stigma against gays origi-
nates from. Seventy-four percent of 
Russians believe that homosexuality 
is some sort of abnormality. This is 
another crucial reason why boycot-
ting won’t work. It’s not the Russian 
government that is against homo-
sexuality, but Russian popular opin-
ion, as Isinbayeva demonstrated.
A boycott is an act of de?ance 
against the government making a 
bad decision. The Russian people’s 
unique geography, culture, and his-
tory has led to an interesting mix 
of European and Asian beliefs, as 
well as individual ones. A boycott 
would almost be hypocritical. Gay 
athletes are barely given a chance to 
succeed — as evidenced by the very 
few professional athletes who have 
come out — in the United States 
and Western Europe. A boycott will 
not persuade the people of Russia to 
strive for equality, as they will only 
see Americans as the enemy, and un-
worthy of competition.
A boycott will also harm Ameri-
can athletes who have prepared 
their entire lives to ski, shoot, and 
jump on the largest stage possible. 
They have prepared for their mo-
ment of glory. To boycott would be 
to take away that potential glory. 
Boycotting will show Russians noth-
ing, only that Americans seem un-
able to compete. By competing in 
Russia, Americans will show Rus-
sian citizens that diversity — in any 
form — is celebrated.

Electronic cigarettes entered the 
market almost 10 years ago, and 
between 2008 and 2012, sales in-
creased from 50,000 to 3.5 million, 
according to USA Today. 
Now, the multi?avored vapor is 
?nally catching regulators’ atten-
tions: Doctors of the Pennsylvania 
Medical Society believe that e-ciga-
rettes should have the same regula-
tions as tobacco products, despite 
e-cigarettes being advertised as safe 
and socially conscious alternatives to 
cigarettes.
People should know more about 
e-cigarettes before they decide how 
they should be regulated, but unfor-
tunately, they’re already a ?xture in 
the market. Pennsylvania physicians 
are right, at least for now: While an-
alysts gather statistics on the effects 
of e-cigarettes and their secondhand 
vapors, e-cigarettes that contain 
nicotine should be regulated just 
like their tobacco-?avored counter-
parts. E-cigarettes seem like an easy 
?x to the problem of secondhand 
smoke, but they should be treated 
with caution.
With e-cigarettes, there is no sec-
ondhand smoke, but more impor-
tantly, they don not use any tobacco. 
As such, the risk for developing can-
cer is drastically lower. However, 
a recent study from France’s Na-
tional Consumer Institute suggested 
that e-cigarettes are potentially 
carcinogenic. This study reveals an 
immediate need for more studies 
on the effects of e-cigarettes. Little 
research has been conducted on e-
cigarettes, and no one seems to know 
much about what happens when a 
person breathes the vapor for even a 
short period of time.
The FDA currently treats e-ciga-
rettes as if they have tobacco, which 
makes sense — nicotine is just as 
addictive without the tobacco. How-
ever, federal law doesn’t bar sale to 
minors, although certain states pro-
hibit selling e-cigarettes to minors. 
Currently, Pennsylvania is not one of 
them  — but it should be.
The purpose of e-cigarettes is to 
deliver nicotine to the body. Unfor-
tunately, they are still largely un-
regulated, and this lack of regulation 
could pose a big problem as their 
popularity increases. We need to 
know more about their effects soon 
so that proper regulations can be put 
in place.

How do you feel about No Shave November?
Surveillance shows need 
for reform within NSA
BRANDON SCHMUCK 
Because of the controversy sur-
rounding the National Security 
Agency (NSA), it came as no sur-
prise when Edward Snowden leaked 
documents revealing that the United 
States has been spying on 35 world 
leaders, many of which are close 
American allies.
Last week, the German tabloid 
Bild am Sonntag revealed that Presi-
dent Barack Obama had been in-
formed that the NSA was spying on 
German chancellor Angela Merkel 
and allowed it to continue. Howev-
er, due to the nature and nearly un-
limited power of this organization, I 
?nd it unlikely that Obama was told.
Critics of Obama like to believe 
that he was all knowing on the mat-
ter, but he most likely had no idea 
that this surveillance was occurring, 
as government secrecy and division 
have been going on for years.
The Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI), the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA), and other federal or-
ganizations have failed to share in-
formation and work together in the 
past. In fact, Attorney General John 
Ashcroft identi?ed this failure to 
share information as the reason that 
the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 were 
carried out so easily. Khalid Mu-
hammad Abdallah al-Mihdhar, one 
of the Sept. 11 hijackers, was placed 
on the CIA watchlist in August 2001, 
but the FBI could not work on his 
case. Ashcroft quoted an FBI agent 
who complained in an email about 
the FBI’s inability to take action, 
“Whatever has happened to this, 
someday somebody will die.”
However, Obama isn’t neces-
sarily innocent in the matter of the 
NSA spying. He voted as a Senator 
in 2008 to support the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act of 2008 to 
expand the organization’s wiretap-
ping abilities. Congress and Obama 
might not have known the extent 
at which the NSA was spying on 
citizens, but they put more power in 
its hands. They essentially gave the 
NSA the power to curtail the Consti-
tution and nearly in?nite ability to 
conduct surveillance.
This problem is occurring in 
many of our federal security agen-
cies. Due to the threat of terrorism, 
the U.S. has continued to place more 
power into the hands of organiza-
tions like the NSA, while not requir-
ing them to report what they are 
doing or follow traditional Consti-
tutional procedures. In the process 
of tracking U.S. enemies through 
NSA surveillance, the government 
creates more enemies by spying on 
countries that had no prior issue 
with the U.S.
President George W. Bush and 
Obama have continued to pass 
national security bills in hopes of 
protecting citizens from terrorist 
attacks. 
However, with every bill, there is 
a major tradeoff — liberty. Ameri-
cans are now giving away their hard-
earned rights for the false notion 
that they are somehow safer.
By giving unwarranted powers 
to the NSA and other organizations, 
the U.S. is creating more enemies 
than it is defeating. 
In fact, the NSA has done very lit-
tle in the way of preventing terrorist 
attacks. The NSA Chief Army Gen-
eral Keith Alexander even admitted 
at an oversight hearing in early Oc-
tober that only one or two terrorist 
plots have been foiled through the 
wiretapping program, according to 
cso.com.
The NSA has enraged many na-
tions that are considered American 
allies, and some are now planning 
to remove U.S. in?uence over the 
Internet. Brazilian President Dilma 
Rousseff is already making plans to 
move Internet servers of major ser-
vices to Brazil and construct under-
water ?ber optic cables that curtail 
the U.S. and run directly to Europe, 
according to the Associated Press.
As the U.S. spies on foreign lead-
ers, many of them are going to take 
efforts like Brazil to remove U.S. 
power from the Internet and, in 
turn, reduce the U.S. government’s 
ability to conduct surveillance. In 
order to ensure the liberties and pro-
tection of citizens while surveillance 
occurs, the NSA must only track 
information on people who are di-
rect threats and remain transparent 
enough that the President knows 
when a major world leader is being 
tracked.

Texas abortion law restricts rights
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Junior Staffwriter
It has been a riveting week with a 
devastating end for Texan pro-choice 
advocates against one of the most re-
strictive anti-abortion bills currently 
in America, HB 12. The bill, which 
is set to close at least one-third of 
Texas’s abortion clinics immediately, 
has had an intensely controversial 
history over the past several months.
In June, state Sen. Wendy Davis 
(D-Texas) successfully ?libustered 
the bill and the fraudulent suppres-
sion tactics of the Republican state 
legislature, but Governor Rick Perry 
(R-Texas) — a notorious reproduc-
tive rights opponent — called a spe-
cial session of the state Senate to 
push the bill through. 
This Monday, District Judge Lee 
Yeakel struck down the most de-
structive provision of the law, which 
requires Texas abortion clinics to ob-
tain admitting privileges at a nearby 
hospital, supposedly to better assure 
the safety of abortion procedures. In 
a victory for Planned Parenthood, 
Yeakel ruled that such a provision 
has no rational basis or medical pur-
pose, and that the provision was un-
constitutional because it placed an 
unnecessary restriction on women 
seeking an abortion.
However, the court decision was 
overturned on Thursday by the con-
servative 5th Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. The court countered that the 
provision requiring admitting privi-
leges was constitutionally valid and 
that “the incidental effect of making 
it more dif?cult or more expensive 
to procure an abortion cannot be 
enough to invalidate” a bill that oth-
erwise serves a legitimate purpose.
The hollowness in the appeals 
court’s excuse to validate an argu-
ably unconstitutional and surely un-
just bill should be self-evident. The 
legitimate purpose this bill suppos-
edly serves is hazy, and Perry, speak-
ing during Thursday’s ruling, seems 
con?dent that its true purpose is to 
“protect a culture of life” in Texas.
Additionally, the claim that the 
law protects Texas women’s health 
and safety is ignorant to the point 
of ridiculousness. Republican politi-
cians dictating the private reproduc-
tive decisions of women continually 
fail to realize that cutting off access 
to abortion clinics will not decrease 
demand for abortions. Instead of 
stopping abortions from occurring, 
anti-abortion laws force women to 
improvise, travel further, and pay ex-
tra for procedures that are ultimately 
more risky than any performed in a 
licensed clinic.
No less important, many clinics 
targeted by the Texas bill and simi-
lar anti-abortion laws provide abor-
tion with many other services vital 
to women’s health. Planned Parent-
hood, for example, offers birth con-
trol, sexually transmitted infection 
and HIV testing, pap smears, and 
breast cancer screenings. When the 
Texas bill goes into effect, women 
will not only lose simple and safe ac-
cess to abortions, but also access to a 
wide range of other crucial services 
that may not be available through 
primary doctors or local hospitals. 
This bill hardly sounds like one de-
signed with the best interests of Tex-
an women in mind.
More likely, this bill is a predict-
able attempt by conservative Re-
publicans to hoard control over the 
reproductive and sexual rights of 
women. 
By staying angry and continu-
ing to ?ght these misogynistic laws 
wherever they inevitably arise na-
tionwide, we can prove that the abil-
ity of a woman to do with her body 
as she so chooses can’t be legislated.
NaNoWriMo is not just for writers
CHLOE THOMPSON 
November is National Novel Writ-
ing Month, more commonly known 
as NaNoWriMo. Writers sign up 
during October to participate in the 
entirely friendly competition, which 
lasts from Nov. 1–20. Participants 
write as much as they can every day 
for the entire month, and if the novel 
ends up being over 50,000 words, 
they can enter to win prizes within 
the NaNoWriMo community.
NaNoWriMo has bene?ts for both 
people who love to write and people 
who feel they have no writing skills 
whatsoever, although the bene?ts 
for writers are a little more obvious 
than those for the latter group. 
NaNoWriMo offers writers of 
all ages from around the world the 
opportunity to connect with other 
writers and published authors, trade 
ideas, and support each other. It 
creates a community-based culture 
around a hobby that can be isolating 
and lonely.
Even beyond offering support and 
inspiration, NaNoWriMo can be re-
ally fun, even if you don’t participate 
in the traditional way. Personally, I 
plan to use NaNoWriMo as a way to 
remind myself to write every day, but 
not to race at a breakneck speed to a 
speci?c character count. The compe-
tition is a fun method for expressing 
creative energies in a personal way.
The bene?ts for non-writers are 
a little more opaque, and lie not so 
much in the writing itself, but more 
in the development of the creative 
process. No experience is required to 
sign up for NaNoWriMo. Of course, 
the prospect of throwing oneself into 
writing with such force can be intim-
idating for people who have not writ-
ten much in the past, but NaNoW-
riMo encourages participants to 
embrace their mistakes, whether 
those participants have been writing 
for 20 years or two days. 
Writers doing the traditional 
challenge have to produce around 
1,666 words every day, which is 
around ?ve-and-a-half pages, to get 
to 50,000 words in a month’s time. 
That kind of cramming does not 
produce America’s next great novel, 
and the people who run NaNoWriMo 
know that. Producing sub-par work 
is acceptable in this competition, 
because everyone does it, and that’s 
how they learn. People who never 
considered themselves writers can 
participate just as effectively as any-
one else.
Even though NaNoWriMo has its 
charms, some people simply don’t 
like to write, but that doesn’t mean 
that they shouldn’t expend their 
creative energies. Creativity has 
the potential to reduce stress, bol-
ster self-con?dence, and stimulate 
brain health, although the cultural 
de?nition of creativity tends toward 
clearly artistic activities like writing, 
drawing, or photography. People 
also tend to think that creativity is 
something that some people have, 
and others just don’t. Being creative 
is not a personality trait; it is another 
word for human expression. Coming 
up with a scienti?c experiment and 
testing it can require the same cre-
ative energies as painting a picture.
So whether you’re writing a novel 
or a computer program, try to stretch 
your creative muscles this November.

On a chilly afternoon, the 
Carnegie Mellon football team 
lost its ?rst conference game 
against Washington University 
in St. Louis last Saturday in 
Gesling Stadium.
Before the game, head 
coach Rich Lackner said that 
the Bears were a very bal-
anced team. “I can’t point to 
any weaknesses on Wash. U.’s 
team,” he said.
In a low-scoring affair 
in which the Tartans found 
themselves leading for the ma-
jority of the game, the Bears 
managed to sneak away with 
a 9–7 victory with a long ?eld 
goal in the waning seconds of 
the game.
After a slow start and ?nd-
ing themselves down 6–0 
early in the ?rst quarter, the 
Tartans drove 72 yards down 
the ?eld in 11 plays to get on 
the scoreboard in the second 
quarter. Senior quarterback 
Rob Kalkstein found senior 
tight end Bryce Pardoe for a 
7-yard touchdown pass for the 
Tartans.
The drive was spearheaded 
by a strong running game fea-
turing senior fullback Zach-
ary Erra-Hernandez, whose 
27-yard scamper put the Tar-
tans in a good ?eld position 
to score on a touchdown a few 
plays later. After a success-
ful extra point by sophomore 
kicker Connor Young, Carn-
egie Mellon took a 7–6 lead, 
and the momentum began to 
swing in their favor.
The game turned into a 
more defensive battle, how-
ever, as both teams exchanged 
punts until the halftime whis-
tle. In the third quarter, an 
over-thrown ball by Washing-
ton quarterback Eric Daginella 
found itself in the hands of 
senior cornerback Liam Mc-
Grath for an interception, giv-
ing Carnegie Mellon the ball at 
its own 44-yard line.
Both teams committed 
costly turnovers, with the 
Bears committing four and the 
Tartans three.
Sophomore cornerback 
Vince Demarchi grabbed an-
other interception of his own 
later in the third quarter; 
however, the Tartans were un-
able to convert the turnover 
into points.
Early in the fourth quarter, 
a fumble by sophomore run-
ning back Troy Witt on a punt 
return gave the Bears threat-
ening ?eld position at the 
Carnegie Mellon 17-yard line. 
Carnegie Mellon’s defense 
responded on the third down 
of Washington’s ensuing pos-
session. Junior linebacker 
Alexander D’Angelo sacked 
Daginella and forced a fumble 
that was recovered by senior 
lineman Ryan Jok to prevent 
any further damage.
Each team kept a strong de-
fensive presence for the rest of 
the game, and it seemed that 
the Tartans would walk away 
with a win.
With less than ?ve minutes 
in the game, the Bears be-
gan a strong drive beginning 
at their 29-yard line. After a 
costly third-down penalty on 
D’Angelo extended their pos-
session, the Bears found them-
selves at Carnegie Mellon’s 
24-yard line with just over a 
minute remaining.
Instead of running the 
clock out, Washington elected 
to pass. The Tartans forced an-
other turnover, as sophomore 
safety Malcolm Guya forced a 
fumble which was recovered 
by senior linebacker Akwasi 
Brefo.
With only 71 seconds left 
in the game, the Tartans need-
ed to convert only one ?rst 
down to seal the victory. But 
three Bears timeouts and a 
strong defense forced the Tar-
tans to punt with 50 seconds 
remaining.
This time, Washington 
didn’t commit a turnover and 
methodically marched to the 
Carnegie Mellon 28-yard line 
with 15 seconds left.
Bears kicker Alex Hall-
wachs, who earlier missed a 
point-after attempt, redeemed 
himself with a 45-yard ?eld 
goal to crush a valiant effort 
from the Tartans.
Despite the undesired re-
sult, the Tartans had many 
positives to take away and 
carry to the remaining games. 
“Guys just came out 
focused and ready to play a 
good football game…. Our in-
tensity level was our strongest 
attribute,” Brefo said.
After dropping to 3–5 for 
the season, the team next 
plays an away game at the 
University of Chicago on Sat-
urday at 1 p.m. The last home 
game of the season is at 6 p.m. 
on Saturday, Nov. 16, which is 
also Senior Day.

Cross country teams suffer loss in UAA Championships
WILLIAM PARK
Sports Editor
After third-place ?nishes in 
the University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) Championships 
last year and a determined 
effort in the Carnegie Mellon 
Invitational four weeks ago, 
the men’s and women’s cross 
country teams looked poised 
to post impressive results in 
Saturday’s UAA Champion-
ships.
But on a chilly Saturday 
afternoon, both teams failed 
to carry the momentum from 
their successes in the Invita-
tional that featured the same 
course in Schenley Park.
The men’s team ?nished 
fourth, while the women’s 
team took eighth place. Wash-
ington University in St. Louis, 
the No. 2 team in the nation, 
?nished ?rst in the men’s 
side, while the No. 9 Univer-
sity of Chicago took ?rst in the 
women’s side.
Carnegie Mellon’s only 
top 10 ?nish was senior Josh 
Newby, who ?nished the the 
men’s 8k course with a time of 
25:44.3.
“We had some good indi-
vidual performances, but as 
a team we didn’t click,” head 
coach Dario Donatelli said. 
“At our conference level, with 
so many nationally ranked 
teams, you better be on, and 
we weren’t on as a team.”
Sophomore Rekha Schnepf 
?nished ?rst in the women’s 
6k race at 27th place over-
all with a time of 23:17.3, 
and junior Erin Kiekhaefer, 
the team’s usual ?rst-place 
?nisher, came in at 32nd over-
all with a time of  23:27.1.
The University of Chicago 
had six runners ?nish within 
the top 20, and New York Uni-
versity, ranked No. 8 in the 
country and the second-place 
team in the Championships, 
had three runners ?nish in the 
top eight.
“I don’t think it was the 
best that we could have done,” 
Schnepf said.
The race was held on a cool 
fall day with strong gusts, so 
the weather could have been 
a factor in the team’s perfor-
mances. However, Schnepf 
dismissed that possibility.
“We’ve run some other 
races that were pretty chilly, 
and we were ?ne. I think it’s 
just an accumulation from the 
season, and we were all more 
nervous,” Schnepf said.
Rounding out the rest of 
the women’s top ?ve ?nishers 
were senior Catherine 
Paquette in 34th place. First-
year Emily Joyce, and sopho-
more Priya Patel ?nished 
together in 38th and 39th 
place.
On the men’s side, while 
Newby led the charge, junior 
George Degen ?nished 13 sec-
onds later in 15th place over-
all with a time of 25:57.5.
“The hills are tough on the 
last two miles ... but I think 
we all ?nished pretty well,” 
Newby said.
Senior Ken Murphy ?n-
ished third on the team and in 
30th place overall with a time 
of 26:34.2, and senior Bren-
dan O’Hara and sophomore 
Marc-Daniel Julien took 35th 
and 36th place.
The team’s top ?ve ?nish-
ers, however, did not come 
close to Washington Universi-
ty in St. Louis, which had four 
runners ?nish within the top 
six. No. 7 New York University, 
?nishing second, had three 
runners ?nish before Newby.
“We knew Wash. U. was 
going to be good. We knew 
NYU was going to be good. 
Hey, maybe we got a little 
wake-up call for our Region-
als,” Donatelli said.
Both teams will have two 
weeks to prepare for their 
next challenge. They travel to 
Muhlenberg College on Nov. 
16 for the NCAA Regionals, 
their penultimate meet of the 
season. Their ?nal meet is the 
NCAA Championships on Nov. 
23 at Hanover College.

The start of the NBA season 
got lost between the commo-
tion of the World Series and 
the overwhelming attention-
grabber that is the NFL.
With an off-season that saw 
more marquee players switch-
ing teams than any in recent 
memory, the NBA landscape 
is entirely different from the 
one last June when the Miami 
Heat won its second straight 
NBA title.
Most NBA teams have sepa-
rated themselves into two cat-
egories for this upcoming sea-
son: Those who will tank in an 
attempt to get a high draft pick 
in next year’s draft and those 
who can win it all. 
The 2014 draft class has 
long been touted as one of the 
best since the 2003 class pro-
duced All-Stars LeBron James, 
Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, 
and Carmelo Anthony. Led by 
Canadian standout Andrew 
Wiggins, many teams see the 
next draft class as an opportu-
nity to draft one of the game-
changing talents necessary to 
win a title.
Many teams, such as the 
Philadelphia 76ers and Boston 
Celtics, have traded many of 
their top players for draft picks 
and cap space. 
The demarcation between 
the tankers and the winners 
has actually caused many to 
question the integrity of a 
sport that condones these sort 
of ?re sale seasons.
Basketball has dealt with 
these issues before when 
the Houston Rockets were 
accused of intentionally los-
ing to get a better pick in the 
1984 draft. To discourage 
teams from purposefully los-
ing, the NBA implemented a 
weighted lottery to determine 
the top three picks. The teams 
with the worst records had the 
highest chances of getting the 
number one overall pick.
The Miami Heat were actu-
ally one of the few contend-
ers that stood pat during the 
off-season, being hamstrung 
by the massive contracts of 
James, Bosh, and Wade. Their 
one major acquisition was 
signing former ?rst overall 
draft pick Greg Oden. Oden 
has suffered knee problems 
since entering the league and 
hasn’t played since the 2009–
10 season, but Miami hopes he 
can stay healthy and provide 
the team with the large inside 
presence it has been missing.
The Celtics, who just last 
season were playing the Heat 
for a chance to win a trip to 
the ?nals, underwent the larg-
est dismantling effort. With 
former Big Three member Ray 
Allen going to the Heat the 
previous season, Boston blew 
up the rest of its nucleus that 
won a title in 2008 and earned 
a ?nals trip in 2010. 
All-Star forwards Kevin 
Garnett and Paul Pierce were 
traded to the Brooklyn Nets 
as part of a massive block-
buster trade that unloaded 
some of the Nets’ overpriced 
bench players onto the Celtics 
along with ?rst-round picks in 
2014, 2016, and 2018. Coach 
Doc Rivers was also released 
from his contract and allowed 
to sign with the Los Angeles 
Clippers, leaving young point 
guard Rajon Rondo as the last 
beacon from the Celtics’ title 
days. Boston replaced Rivers 
with former Butler University 
coach Brad Stevens.
The other major domino 
in free agency was former Or-
lando Magic and Los Angeles 
Laker center Dwight Howard. 
After a nearly two-year saga 
with Howard trying to make 
up his mind where he wanted 
to play, Howard ?nally chose 
to sign a long-term deal with 
the Houston Rockets, joining 
rising star James Harden and 
former New York Knicks sen-
sation Jeremy Lin. 
The Atlanta Hawks, Dallas 
Mavericks, Golden State War-
riors, and the Lakers were all 
holding out hope that they 
would land Howard and had 
to quickly formulate a Plan B.
The Hawks lost their own 
major free agent, forward 
Josh Smith, to the Detroit Pis-
tons and only had restricted 
free agent Jeff Teague left to 
try and build a team around, 
missing out on most of the 
better free agents.
After winning the 2011 
title, the Mavericks gutted 
their roster, letting their de-
fensive anchor Tyson Chan-
dler walk in free agency as 
they attempted to clear up 
cap space to land a bigger 
free agent. They hoped to sign 
point guards Deron Williams 
or Chris Paul as well as How-
ard, but all players signed else-
where. During the offseason, 
the Mavericks were left to sign 
two high-level guards in José 
Calderón and Monta Ellis to 
try and get longtime All-Star 
Dirk Nowitzki another cham-
pionship ring.
The Golden State Warriors, 
who surprised everyone by 
taking the San Antonio Spurs 
to six games in the Western 
Conference Semi?nals, signed 
former Denver Nuggets for-
ward Andre Iguodala to ?rm 
up their defense. At the same 
time, the Warriors were un-
able to re-sign former backup 
point guard Jarrett Jack and 
forward Carl Landry, key play-
ers from last year’s bench.
The perennial powerhouse 
Lakers suffered the largest 
blow by losing Howard. While 
he was trouble in the locker 
room, he represented the fu-
ture franchise players with 
Kobe Bryant on the decline re-
covering from a torn Achilles 
and playing in his 18th season. 
They are ?nally giving up their 
position at the top of the West-
ern Conference and can no 
longer lay claim to being the 
best team in their home arena, 
with the Staples Center being 
shared with the signi?cantly 
better Clippers.
This NBA season will be 
unusual to watch, to say the 
least. Expect many blowouts 
as the difference between the 
intentional winners and losers 
has led to a massive talent gap. 
What may ultimately decide 
who’s still playing in June, 
however, will be how well 
each contender integrates its 
new acquisitions and how well 
these acquisitions will mesh 
into each team.
SPORTS COMMENTARY
CMU volleyball impresses in penultimate home game
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Junior Staffwriter
In its penultimate game 
before the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) champion-
ships, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s volleyball team built 
impressive momentum with a 
dominating win over Mount 
Aloysius College.
The Tartans won the ?rst 
seven points and never relin-
quished their lead once they 
scored. In a great team effort, 
the Tartans took the Wednes-
day game in straight sets 25–9, 
25–10, and 25–8.
On the second point of the 
game, ?rst-year defensive spe-
cialist Molly Higgins made a 
save in a play that ended up 
being Mount Aloysius’s last 
chance to tie the score. 
With four aces and 
mistake-free play including 
eight digs, Higgins stood out 
among many strong perfor-
mances from the Carnegie 
Mellon side.
She credited her success to 
the rest of the team. “As a de-
fensive player, a lot of my play 
is supported by other players 
doing their jobs ?rst,” she said. 
“The block was really 
strong throughout the match, 
making it easy to read the op-
posing team’s offense. The set-
ter was also reliable in getting 
to the ball every time I got a 
dig, making it possible for the 
point to continue,” she said.
Team captain and junior Ali 
Celentano echoed Higgins’s 
sentiments about the team’s 
strong performance. 
“It was really good to see 
everyone on the team step 
up. We played at the level we 
wanted to and weren’t slowed 
down by what was on the 
other side of the court,” Celen-
tano said.
She expressed optimism for 
the rest of the season, saying, 
“Focusing on our side of the 
court has been the goal for us 
this season, and I think how 
well we did today could very 
well translate into our up-
coming matches at [the UAA 
Championships].”
The team’s net play was 
extremely impressive. With 
a 59 percent kill percentage, 
the whole team was locked 
in at the net. Mount Aloysius 
also ?nished the game with 
zero blocks, showing just how 
dominant Carnegie Mellon’s 
attack was.
First-year opposite hitter 
Kristen Flint and senior out-
side hitter Senna Parsa had 
10 kills each, while ?rst-year 
middle blocker Jackie Gibbons 
contributed both offensively 
and defensively with six kills 
and four blocks.
The game itself never felt 
close. In addition to scoring 
the ?rst seven points of the 
game, the Tartans scored nine 
of the ?rst 13 points in the sec-
ond set, and 11 of the ?nal 12 
points of the game. 
Each set was decided by at 
least 15 points, and the ?nal 
score did not do justice to how 
strong a team performance 
the Tartans put on.
The Tartans kept their mo-
mentum going on Saturday, 
when they defeated Allegheny 
College in three sets. The two 
wins from last week improved 
their record to 23–8 for the 
season.
The team’s next and ?nal 
challenge of the season is the 
UAA Championships held 
at Brandeis University this 
Friday.
Soccer teams have mixed results during weekend trip
WILLIAM PARK
Sports Editor
Both Carnegie Mellon’s 
men’s and women’s soccer 
teams continued competi-
tive conference play over the 
weekend.
On Friday, both teams 
traveled to Case Western Re-
serve University and came 
away with victories. The 
men’s team won 4–2, and the 
women’s side won 1–0.
After their victories, the 
teams traveled to the Univer-
sity of Rochester for a Sunday 
clash. The men’s team drew 
0–0, and the women’s side 
lost 2–3 in double overtime.
“Of course, we would have 
liked to have gotten two wins,” 
senior defender Ben Bryant 
said. “But we’re happy getting 
four points. It de?nitely beats 
one win and one loss.”
Though the men’s Case 
Western game ended with 
a lopsided score, the game 
was much closer. The Tartans 
trailed 1–2 at halftime after 
all three goals were scored 
within the last two minutes of 
the ?rst half.
The Tartans charged back 
in the second half. Sopho-
more mid?elder Connor 
Webb scored two minutes 
into the second half off of a 
free kick by senior defender 
Cole Christensen. Senior for-
ward Max Tassano headed in 
a goal in the 51st minute for 
the clincher.
Against the No. 14 Uni-
versity of Rochester, the Tar-
tans played a tough, physical 
game. The Tartans received 
four yellow cards, while Roch-
ester received three.
“The Rochester game 
showed that our defense can 
get organized, and we can 
sustain a lot of pressure from 
good teams,” Bryant said.
Facing 19 shots, senior 
goalie Christopher Madden 
made six saves.
“[Madden] came up big, 
with big-time saves,” Bryant 
said.
Carnegie Mellon’s wom-
en’s squad also started off the 
weekend road trip with a win 
against Case Western, with 
senior forward Alex Venegas’s 
?rst-half goal holding up as 
the only score of the game.
“We’re happy with the win 
on Friday, but we’re still dis-
appointed with [Sunday’s] 
result,” said graduate student 
goalkeeper Anna Albi.
In Rochester, the women’s 
squad started strong. Soph-
omore mid?elder Carson 
Quiros headed in a goal off 
a corner kick in the seventh 
minute.
After Rochester equal-
ized in the 18th minute, the 
Tartans responded. Junior 
mid?elder Jordyn Greenberg 
headed in the Tartans’ second 
goal for a 2–1 lead.
Rochester attempted only 
two corner kicks in the game, 
but made one of them count. 
With less than a minute in 
the ?rst half, Rochester’s Kim 
Stagg scored off of their ?rst 
corner in the game.
The game remained tied 
at two until double overtime, 
when Rochester’s Jessica 
Smith scored the decisive goal 
in the 107th minute.
“We were de?nitely the 
more dangerous team today, 
but we were just unlucky,” 
Albi said.
Both teams head on the 
road for their last regular 
season game this Saturday 
against Emory University.

Alpenglow comes to CMU
Indie pop band receives warm reception from students
Indie folk-rock band Alpenglow visited Pittsburgh 
for the first time last Wednesday to perform at the 
Underground. The Vermont-based group has been 
building a fan base with live performances across 
the country and is currently touring with Brooklyn-
based indie pop band Lucius, while promoting the 
release of its new EP Solitude. Lucius, the original 
headliner for the show, ended up canceling its gig 
due to medical reasons.
The concert started 10 minutes late, but once it 
started, the audience was immediately taken by the 
charm and originality of Alpenglow’s music. In front 
of a crowd of around 20 people, the band performed 
a set of 10 songs, many of which were new and 
unreleased. The group performed “The Following,” 
a slow song about love, and followed with the more 
upbeat “Gabriel.”
Alpenglow continued with “Drone,” “Shout it Out,” 
and “Solitude,” the last of which belongs to the 
band’s EP. The set covered fast songs and slow 
songs in no particular order, but the energy was so 
high that the audience was engaged every step of 
the way. The band went on to perform a love song, 
“Eliza,” followed by “Border Lines” and “Been So 
Long.”
Toward the end, the group played “Old Country.” 
Before this performance, Alpenglow’s main vocalist, 
Graeme Daubert, shared that the song was written 
about his grandfather — one of the few times the 
band spoke out to the audience. The set closed with 
a single from the album Catskills — a quiet, somber 
tune that picked up toward the end, characterized 
by the ghostly effect of the violin.
Even for those who had never heard of Alpenglow 
before the show, the group’s style was immediately 
evident from the songs it played: The band members 
played heavily with the acoustic guitar, and their 
songs were characterized by their distinctive use 
of harmonies and instruments. The tunes that 
incorporated the violin were particularly impressive. 
The band made frequent use of the keyboard, banjo, 
and mouth harmonica, which the audience was 
delighted to hear. Some of their songs had infectious 
beats, sounding like Coldplay and Arcade Fire rolled 
into one band.
The band members stayed on after the performance 
to talk to students and sell copies of their EP, and 
were very friendly and engaging. In the future, 
look forward to hearing more from this excellent, 
upcoming band.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Ryan and Matt 
(if those are your real 
names),
Dudes, I can’t help it! 
I’m stuck in my room 
watching all the TV shows 
from my childhood in the 
’90s. I’ve made it through 
all eight seasons of Home 
Improvement, the original 
Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers, seven seasons 
of Buffy, two seasons 
of Sonic the Hedgehog, 
and all four Home Alone 
movies. I’m sure all the 
girls on my floor think it’s 
fly that I’m getting back 
in touch with this culture, 
but none of them want to 
watch the TGIF lineups 
with me. What am I doing 
wrong, home skillets?
Help would be nice. As if!
Netflix-Occupied Student

Gorging In Archives
Dear NOSTALGIA,
Chill out dawg, We’ve been 
there. Bill Nye the Science 
Guy is the reason Ryan got 
into Carnegie Mellon, and 
we all yearn for a time before 
Dubya Bush. The second 
half of the semester often 
picks up and will knock 
those lazy tendencies right 
out of you. That might also 
help with your girl problem; 
women love a man who can 
demonstrate dependability. 
There is a time for work 
and a time for play, and the 
’90s were certainly a time 
for play, but I’m sure you 
know that Carnegie Mellon 
is unfortunately a place for 
work. Buckle up!
Actually, for the ladies, 
Friends should be next in 
your Netflix cue.
Matt & Ryan
Dear Matt & Ryan,
I went to a great 
Halloween party last 
night, and I met a really 
great guy. Don’t let him 
know, but he is definitely 
my next boyfriend. I went 
as a classic witch and 
happened across the 
perfect scarecrow. I hope 
next year he can be the 
yang to my yin; needless 
to say, we really hit it 
off. The only problem is I 
never got his name, or his 
Andrew ID. Can you guys 
help me?
Enamored, Lucky 
Partygoer Has

Dear ELPHABA,
If you love someone deeply 
enough, anything can 
happen, even miracles. You 
might want to head back 
to that house and wait for 
your Halloween love, just 
like Brigadoon’s Tommy. We 
have no doubt that Jack 
Skellington can help you 
find your love, or maybe if 
you get the flying monkeys 
to kidnap the girl dressed 
as Dorothy, Toto will lead 
your scarecrow right to you. 
We’re pretty sure that might 
be a felony, but if you do it in 
the name of love, any judge 
will look the other way.
Scarecrow, if you are 
reading this, go find your 
Elphaba. She’s head 
over heels for you, and 
we don’t want to be 
responsible for attempted 
kidnapping…

Arcade Fire’s latest opus, double album Re?ektor, proves 
the band only continues to get better. Featuring lush 
orchestral arrangements and dance-ready rhythms, the 
album — released last week — meditates on life, death, 
and the collective and singular experiences of music and 
art. Just like Talking Heads — an obvious in?uence on 
the album — in the 1980s, Arcade Fire is this decade’s 
most creative, well-known group that continues to outdo 
everyone else, even itself.
Arcade Fire doesn’t release albums just for the sake of 
releasing albums; instead, the band spends two to three 
years crafting a piece of art that is unveiled to the world 
once ?nished. Once the biggest band in indie world, 
Arcade Fire became one of the most well-known names 
in mainstream music when its 2010 album The Suburbs 
won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2011.
Produced by the original hipster hater and retired LCD 
Soundsystem creative force James Murphy, Re?ektor 
features rhythms far better suited to dance than 
anything we’ve heard from Arcade Fire before. The title 
track features a solid disco beat, while “Here Comes The 
Night Time” has everything from dramatic tempo shifts 
to bouncing Caribbean hand drums and jangling piano.
Arcade Fire has brought new ingredients to its unique 
sound with every album, and Re?ektor adds rich 
orchestral arrangements to the stew. Second-disc 
standouts “Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice),” “Porno,” and 
“Afterlife” are prime examples of the mastery with which 
Arcade Fire incorporates new sounds into the fabric of 
the songs.
That being said, one of the album’s highest points 
comes with the simple rock-and-roll stomp of “Normal 
Person.” With rougher production and drums that sound 
like crashing pots and pans, the song is a momentary 
explosion in an otherwise controlled ?ow of emotion.
Arcade Fire seems to exclusively tackle “big idea” 
themes, and after the band’s debut — 2004’s Funeral 
— Re?ektor is the second album in which the band has 
focused so intensely on life and death. Nine years later, 
Arcade Fire has gone a little deeper than the child-
like musings of Funeral. While that album’s “Rebellion 
(Lies)” chose to hide from the world rather than face it, 
Re?ektor’s “Afterlife” instead muses on deep questions 
with lyrics like, “When love is gone, where does it go?” 
and visions of “what comes next.”
At times, the lyrics — like those in “Joan of Arc” — 
sound like poetry written by someone in the 10th grade: 
“They’re the ones that spit on you / Cause they got no 
heart / I’m the one that will follow you / You’re my Joan 
of Arc.”
But that’s always been a part of what makes Arcade 
Fire so engaging. These musicians wear their hearts on 
their sleeves and say with dignity what many of us are 
embarrassed to say, with the musical chops to back up 
every semi-cheesy line.
In a year of high-pro?le album releases and rollouts that 
employed wild strategies to build up anticipation — Daft 
Punk’s Random Access Memories and Kanye West’s 
Yeezus come to mind — none feel more deserving of 
the hype than Re?ektor. It’s an album that proves that 
a band at the peak of its creative powers is still willing 
to try new things rather than settle on formulas. It’s a 
testament to how, even in an age when Jay-Z’s album 
goes instantly platinum thanks to a multimillion-dollar 
business deal with Samsung, passion and commitment 
are still recognized.

Parlour Song packs an emotional punch
The Quantum Theatre production immerses audiences in a meaningful dialogue
There comes a moment in life when things begin to 
feel as if they are slowly losing meaning, as things 
you once thought you understood — things you 
thought you loved — slip away.
Last Friday, Quantum Theatre opened the play 
Parlour Song, featuring School of Drama professor 
Cameron Knight. Instead of the theater’s East Liberty 
venue, the play is staged at the former Pittsburgh 
Burger Company location in Homestead, adapted 
specially for this production and lending itself to an 
untraditional and intimate performance setup.
Set in middle-class suburbia outside London, the 
play revolves around the lives of three characters: 
Ned (played by Knight), his friend and neighbor Dale 
(Brendan McMahon), and Ned’s wife Joy (Sarah Silk).
Ned is a demolition expert, literally blowing up old 
things to make room for the new on a daily basis. Yet 
in his personal life, he seems to do just the opposite, 
trying as hard as he can to preserve his marriage and 
his life.
In the couple’s ?rst scene, a desperately eager-to-
please Ned tries to enthuse his passive-aggressive 
wife by offering her more and more food and stories, 
all of which she rejects, unwilling to engage with her 
husband. Opposite Ned’s desperate attempts to ?nd 
meaning in his life is his best friend Dale’s ability 
to live in the moment. Dale’s humor cuts through 
the tension created by Ned and Joy’s complicated 
relationship, but McMahon’s portrayal gives Dale 
depth in his own right.
The play deals with themes of dissatisfaction, the 
impermanence of life within time, and a fascination 
with the power of destruction. As Ned’s possessions 
all mysteriously begin disappearing from his home, 
the man who destroys things for a living begins to 
have nightmares of his life itself evaporating away. 
It becomes not the objects themselves that are 
important, but rather the symbolism of losing all the 
little parts of your life until you have nothing. Objects 
become symbolic of moments in time, in a world 
where relationships are impermanent and life is 
unstable overall.
The acting captures the intensity of ordinary yet 
profound dilemmas. Each of the three actors carries 
equal weight, creating a dynamic in the room 
that makes the simple script profound: Knight’s 
enactment of a man desperate to preserve the past, 
McMahon’s ability to balance Dale’s infectious 
humor but still come off as a dynamic character, and 
Silk’s stunning, emotionally charged performance 
of a woman trapped in her own life, searching for 
a way out. There are moments when we feel as if 
we’re inside the minds of all three characters. Even if 
everything that has happened isn’t fully understood, 
we feel fully immersed in their world.
What makes this play so engaging is that even as 
it deals directly with increasingly dark themes, the 
dialogue between the characters stays realistic. 
There is the sense that in spite of the characters’ 
urgency and desperation, these scenes are ordinary 
moments in time. This effect makes the piece all the 
more relatable, making viewers question the meaning 
in their own lives.
In addition to the dynamic acting, the tension in the 
play is created through the use of echoing music 
and dim spotlights. The stage and audience are 
undivided, making the stage feel a part of reality. 
Projected words, phrases, and images are used to 
comment on the action in between scenes. When the 
play ends, there is an intimate energy left over in the 
room, as the bedside lamp stays dimly lit. The scene 
created the illusion that although the actors had left, 
the set still carried the longing, anger, and confusion 
of the story.
Parlour Song will run through Nov. 24 in Homestead.

If you’re seriously considering a career as an astronaut, 
you shouldn’t see Gravity. If you’re looking for an intense 
psychological thriller with dazzling special effects, you 
absolutely should.
Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity is only 91 minutes long, but 
it seems longer. Once the action picks up — about ?ve 
minutes into the movie — it grips you and doesn’t let go 
until the very end, alternating between long stretches 
of terror and rare moments of relief. You’ll be breathing 
almost as hard as mission specialist Ryan Stone (Sandra 
Bullock), forgetting you’re safely grounded on Earth, 
rather than out in space and losing oxygen with every 
gasp.
The ?lm follows two American astronauts forced to 
improvise for their survival when their spacecraft is hit 
by ?ying debris, sending them tumbling into space. 
Their luck is both devastatingly bad and absurdly 
good at different times, and at certain moments, these 
astronauts are literally holding on by the tips of their 
?ngers.
The characters are pigeonholed into their stereotypes 
very early on: Stone is the inexperienced genius doctor 
on her ?rst space mission, while Matt Kowalski (George 
Clooney) is a chatterbox veteran astronaut who keeps his 
cool under pressure.
In fact, with everything else going on, it’s easy to 
overlook that the characters are remarkably ?at and rely 
largely on established schemata. Bullock’s character 
hints at a tragic past, but even that story is barely 
?eshed out. The lack of complexity is likely a strategic 
choice — a shortcut to get to the action faster, rather 
than wading through slower scenes to establish story. 
Whatever the reason, this lack of character development 
inevitably makes the protagonists less compelling — 
perhaps a necessary sacri?ce for the pace of the ?lm.
Character development aside, Gravity is most impressive 
as a visual experience. For this reason, it should almost 
exclusively be seen in theaters. Above anything else, 
the movie is characterized by its stunningly sharp 
photography. During a few of the slower-paced scenes, 
we have time to zoom out and gaze at dazzling views 
of the Earth’s surface through its swirling atmosphere. 
The ?lm does a brilliant job of planting the viewer in 
outer space; it’s easy to understand how beautiful 
and expansive, yet also terrifying and unforgiving, the 
universe must seem to these astronauts.
These views are accompanied by a minimal music 
score — a pulsing bass that increases in tempo as 
tension rises. The score suits the ?lm’s clean aesthetic 
and simple, driving plot, but even more notable than the 
?lm’s use of music is its use of silence. At points, the 
pulse drops out, leaving both viewers and characters 
in nail-biting silence, reminding us how very alone the 
astronauts are in their struggle to survive.
Gravity is an immersive experience on all levels, visually 
and psychologically. You’ll leave the theater awed, in 
both good and bad ways. The ?lm reminds us that the 
universe is a beautiful and wondrous place, but as Stone 
eloquently puts it during one of the ?lm’s rare comedic 
moments, “I hate space.”

You know what’s awesome? Giant monsters. You know what’s even better? Giant 
robots ?ghting giant monsters. Director Guillermo del Toro revives the kaiju genre with 
his spectacular ?lm that celebrates action as a form of art and pure entertainment. 
When the world is on the brink of kaiju domination, humanity’s only hope is to recruit 
the world’s best ?ghters to pilot warrior robots called jaegers. The ?lm contains some 
of the best action sequences in recent memory that truly revive and rede?ne monster 
movies with its own inventive rush of adrenaline. For two hours, you can sit down 
and regress to your 10-year-old self as you are reminded of what makes for true 
entertainment.

returns as the Wolverine to ?ght samurai-ninjas in Japan. After battling his inner demons, 
the Wolverine believes he is ?nally free of his superhero abilities when a Japanese 
business tycoon offers to get rid of his cursed immortality. What ensues afterward is 
an adrenaline-fueled series of intense action sequences that is perfectly paced and 
suspenseful. After a rather lackluster prequel, director James Mangold manages to 
make this more than a popcorn summer ?ick by infusing it with authentic character 
development and a powerfully dark storyline that avoids cheesiness. Jackman (and his 
insanely ripped body) proves yet again that he can do just about anything, especially 
with a set of claws made of adamantium.

Few things are as dear to Western Pennsylvanians as 
the 1968 horror ?lm, Night of the Living Dead, ?lmed in 
Evans City, Pa., by horror movie pioneer and Carnegie 
Institute of Technology alumnus George A. Romero. 
Stephen Catanzarite (DC ’90) combined his love for the 
?lm with his creative writing background to create Night 
of the Living Dead: The Opera.
On Tuesday evening, students and faculty members 
gathered in the Gladys Schmidt Creative Writing 
Center in Baker Hall for an intimate conversation with 
Catanzarite about writing and working as a Carnegie 
Mellon graduate. Sigma Tau Delta, the international 
English honor society, organized the talk.
“I didn’t know what I was going to do,” Catanzarite 
said of his career path after graduation. He ?rst began 
writing for industrial videos, but eventually became the 
founder of two charter schools that emphasize the arts in 
education.
It was a combination of chance meetings and Hollywood 
connections that led to Catanzarite penning the 
libretto for an opera. It was originally proposed to 
him as a Broadway musical, but Catanzarite thought 
the inherently campy nature of musicals would ruin 
the story. He took his job very seriously, wanting to 
pay homage to the genius of the ?lm, rather than 
entertaining for entertaining’s sake. The opera stays true 
to its source material, following seven people trapped in 
a farmhouse during a zombie attack.
So yes, the zombies sing — but the catch is that they 
can only communicate as a group, representing what 
Catanzarite describes as a “voice or consciousness in 
numbers.” The team behind the production also kept 
it rooted in Western Pennsylvania, throwing in small 
references to places or people familiar to the area and 
even some Pittsburghese.
Catanzarite wasn’t the only member of the Carnegie 
Mellon community involved in the production. Andres 
Cladera (CFA ’03) and Erica Olden (CFA ’97, ’01) are the 
co-founders of The Microscopic Opera Company, which 
is putting on the show. Gregory Lehane, a Carnegie 
Mellon professor of drama, directed the production, and 
Britton Mauk (CFA ’13) is the scenic designer.
Catanzarite’s passion for the project was obvious just by 
how much he had to say. Although the subject of his talk 
was writing in general, the conversation kept coming 
back to the production. He also talked at length about 
his time at Carnegie Mellon and how much it prepared 
him for writing the opera. Catanzarite showed Dietrich 
students that their training in the humanities can be 
expanded in strange but productive ways.
The gathering of people was small, but that atmosphere 
lent itself to the conversational nature of Catanzarite’s 
talk, as students and faculty interrupted to clarify or ask 
questions, or even to crack a joke.
After talking about his accomplishments for an hour, 
Catanzarite jokingly asked, “Am I a distinguished alumni 
yet?”
The world premiere of Night of the Living Dead: The 
Opera ran from Oct. 31 through Nov. 3 at the Kelly 
Strayhorn Theater in the Penn Avenue Arts District.

Everyone has favorite and least favorite seasons. For 
me, winter is certainly my least favorite, mostly due to 
the hassle of determining what to wear each morning. 
Not only do I have to worry about looking presentable, I 
also have to stay warm. I ?nd myself repeating the same 
out?t combination of leggings, a sweater, and boots 
every day because it’s quick and comfortable — but 
that’s become stale.
Fortunately, I’ve discovered a couple methods to 
alleviate this problem. You can read them below in this 
comprehensive guide to dressing for cold weather.
Outerwear
Let’s start with outerwear. You have a lot of options, but 
depending on the situation, some are more appropriate 
than others. For nice, crisp fall weather, choose a classic 
denim jacket. These look great layered over anything 
from a patterned dress to leggings and a trendy shirt. 
Avoid wearing jeans with your denim jacket; the denim 
on denim look could make you look too much like a 
cowboy. Leather jackets are another fall staple.
Slightly colder weather calls for a thicker jacket, like the 
very trendy military jacket. It seems like the military 
jacket may even have replaced the denim jacket as a fall 
wardrobe staple — you’ll see them everywhere you look. 
Layer yours over a sweater to stay warm.
Windbreakers are also pretty common, and as the name 
suggests, they’re the best for those days that are windy, 
rainy, or just plain gross. If you’re planning to buy one, 
get one with a hood to protect yourself from the rain.
When it becomes inhumanly cold outside and you have 
to walk to class, it’s time to bring out the puffy jacket. 
While these jackets may not be the most ?attering, 
at this point, warmth should be your top priority. 
Accessorize with a cute hat or head wrap to keep your 
ears warm, as well as gloves and a thick winter scarf.
For more formal occasions, blazers are a great way to 
dress up an out?t when it isn’t too cold out. Try wearing 
one over a nicer top, with jeans and boots for a chic look. 
Pea coats are also appropriate for dressier events. You 
can pair a pea coat with a dress, tights, and heels for a 
polished look.
Sweaters
Now that you’re an expert on which type of jackets to 
wear and when to wear them, we can move on to the 
shirts, sweaters, and cardigans category. Generally, 
when choosing an out?t in the morning, the ?rst item of 
clothing that comes to mind is the most comfortable — 
leggings. Then I face the struggle of ?nding a sweater I 
haven’t worn in the past couple of days that’s also long 
enough to wear with leggings. Sound familiar? Well, here 
are a few tips to help you deal with this problem.
It’s always good to have a lot of comfortable sweaters, 
but think about adding variety next time you shop. A 
close relative of the comfortable, oversized sweater is the 
Colder weather brings new opportunities for fashion inspiration

sweater dress. You can wear it with leggings or tights 
and boots and it’s basically a new version of your old 
go-to out?t. If you have any longer cardigans, layer those 
over longer shirts as well.
In terms of cardigans, everyone should own at least 
three. I recommend black, gray, and tan as the bare 
minimum. Colors are always good to have, but neutrals 
are the top priority since they can be worn over 
anything.
Tops
Tops are the main way to add variety to your out?ts, so 
make sure they’re interesting. You should de?nitely have 
a couple of basics to build off of, but try to ?nd shirts that 
have some color, detail, or anything else that’s unique. 
You also want to look for shirts of different lengths 
and materials, so that you can wear them with either 
leggings or jeans. Lately, people have been wearing 
edgier shirts with studs and cutouts. At the same time, 
many stores have been featuring T-shirts with animals 
printed on them — another major trend — as well as 
tops with beaded necklines. Get long-sleeved versions of 
these to keep warm, or if yours has shorter sleeves, wear 
it with a cardigan.
Bottoms
Bottoms can be another issue in winter weather. When 
it’s warm out, it’s easy to just throw on a pair of shorts; 
you don’t risk each out?t looking the same, since shorts 
come in a variety of styles and colors. However, it’s easy 
to feel repetitive as it gets colder and you ?nd yourself 
alternating between jeans and black leggings.
From blue jeans and black leggings, the obvious step up 
is to wear printed versions of either of these. Recently, 
the range of styles of printed jeans and leggings has 
signi?cantly broadened to those with cutouts, leather 
panels, and more. Colored denim has been in style for 
a while and is a great way to add interest to your look. 
Colored jeans look best paired with a neutral-colored top. 
Floral leggings have been in style for while and seem to 
be here to stay, as well as Aztec print.
However, there are alternatives to jeans and leggings, 
such as corduroys. Now, I know what you’re thinking: 
They’re old-man pants. At least, that’s what I thought 
when I ?rst heard that Free People clothing store was 
introducing them a few years ago — but the ?oral and 
plaid prints completely changed my mind. Free People 
also sells solid-colored corduroy pants, and other stores 
have similar items.
If you feel like dressing up a little, wear a skirt with 
tights. To class, you could wear this with a cardigan and 
boots, or if you have a special event to attend, complete 
the look with a nice shirt and heels.
Jewelry
My last tip is to accessorize with jewelry to vary your 
out?ts. A chunky necklace can make last week’s plain 
sweater look completely different. The same can be done 
with a pair of statement earrings. The key is to mix and 
match to create a whole new wardrobe for winter.
