Two One-Act Plays 
Opening December 8
Two long one act plays will be featured on the same bill when the 
Drama Department opens its last major production of the semester 
on Saturday, December 8. The one-acts are The Merchant, a farce; 
and Venus and Adonis, an exotic fantasy.
The production marks the ini-#—------------------------------------------------

Spurned Venus
Venus and Aonis, by Andre 
Obey, adapted from the French 
by Professor Authur Wilmurt of 
the Drama Department, is the story 
of a moment in the life of Venus, 
the goddess of love. In her garden 
she has sighted the extremely 
handsome Adonis and promptly 
decides to add him to her long list 
of masculine conquests. But 
Adonis would rather be out in the 
forest hunting than biding time 
with an exquisite goddess. Venus’ 
Strong feminine ego is aroused, 
and the plot progresses from there.
The Merchant, adapted from a 
play attributed to T. Macchius
Vacation I
Students can lay aside their 
books, slide rules, and paint 
brushes when the Thanksgiv­
ing: recess begins at 5:30 p.m., 
on Wednesday, November 21. 
After four days of rest and no 
homework, classes will resume 
on Monday, November 26.
Plantus, a Roman comedy play­
wright, was intended to entertain 
a university and general audience. 
The conventions of Roman comedy 
have not been discarded in the 
adaptation.
Amused the Ancients
When the play was first pro­
duced, the ancient Romans un- 
doutedly were amused at the story 
of a son and his father competing 
for the affections of the same girl. 
To insure that this century-old 
play would not appear outdated, 
Professor Wilmurt has inserted 
some modern 1951 dialogue.
Mr. Newman has brought the 
“femme fatale” up to date by giv­
ing her a Southern accent and an 
alluring lisp. She is just one of the 
many characters that wander 
through the streets of ancient 
Athens, the locale of the play, 
decked out in flowing togas and 
some whatnots that never went 
with the Roman period.
SC Election
Elections for representatives 
and assistant secretary of Stu­
dent Council will be held on 
December 11. There are open­
ings for three representatives 
from E & S, one from H & SS, 
one from Fine Arts, and one 
from MMCC. The small num­
ber of openings in Student 
Council is due to recent re­
vision of the Council Consti­
tution whereby there shall be 
one representative for every 
200 students. Formerly there 
was one for each 100 students.
Petitions are now available 
in dean of men’s office and 
must be returned by Decem­
ber 4. To be eligible for elec­
tion, one must be a full time 
day student and at least a sec­
ond semester freshman at time 
of election.
The position of assistant sec­
retary is open to any junior 
student in Margaret Morrison.
Candidates may use bulletin 
boards for electioneering pro­
vided material is approved by 
office of director of student 
personnel and welfare. There 
should be no campaigning of 
any sort for any certified can­
didate within 100 feet of polls.

50 Signers Request 
Council Disband Itself
Vassil Blasts Pep Rally Support;
Campus Chest Lags Far Behind
Last Wednesday’s Council meeting saw controversial issues fly 
thick and fast as many traditional campus sore spots were probed 
anew. In one of the longest meetings to date, Council tabled a 
petition to dissolve itself, heard condemnations of student pep rally 
and Campus Chest support, and#-----------------------------------------------------
held for action an amendment 
which would give Council the 
power to investigate fully Carne­
gie’s campus problems.
The petition calling for Council 
to dissolve itself, signed by fifty 
students, was read and tabled for 
one week. Since the petition takes 
the form of an amendment to the 
constitution, a two-thirds vote of 
Council members is necessary if 
the amendment is to be carried 
further. If it passes (and this, 
from all reports, appears doubt­
ful), an all school vote will be 
necessary.
See ‘Letters to the Editor,’ 
page 2.
Rallies Flop
John Vassil, speaking as chair­
man of the pep rally committee, 
blamed students and the Kiltie 
Band for the failure of the Lehigh 
pep rally. Said Vassil: “The big­
gest fault lies with the students. 
They havn’t supported any of the 
rallies enthusiastically, but the Le­
high rally was the crowning blow. 
Then too, the Kiltie Band, which 
derives much of its financial sup­
port from Council and the stu­
dents, refused to appear at the 
most important rally of the year.”
Continuing, Vassil stated that 
early in the year plans had been 
laid for a Monday morning pep
Moskovitz New 
Math Chief
Acting Dept. Head 
Earned Ph D At Brown
Professor David Moskovitz has 
been chosen to replace the late Dr. 
Joseph B. Rosenbach as acting 
head of the mathematics depart­
ment. Professor Moskovitz, who 
was made a full professor last Sep­
tember, has been at Carnegie since 
1925.
The new acting head was born 
in Ungvar, Hungary. He received 
a bachelor of science degree in 
civil engineering at CIT in 1925, 
and for four years after this was 
an instructor here, while earning 
his master’s degree.
Author of Texts & Articles
After getting his Ph.D. at Brown 
University in 1932, he returned to 
Carnegie as assistant professor and 
served in this capacity until his 
appointment as associate professor 
in 1944.
Professor Moskovitz and the late 
Professor Rosenbach, along with 
Professor E. A. Whitman, were co­
authors of many mathematics texts 
used extensively in high schools 
and colleges. Dr. Moskovitz also 
authored numeious research arti- [Cotttinued on page 6]
rally in the event of a victory over 
Lehigh. “But,” said Vassil, “this 
lack of student interest makes a 
clear case against anything like 
this in the future.” Vassil plans a 
more complete report later.
Contributions Lag 
A1 DeVido reported that student 
contributions to the Campus Chest 
are far below requirements—only 
about $500 out of a goal of near 
$2000. This, he said, was due 
partly to a mixup in contacting 
students, but largely to a lack of 
student support.
The Campus Chest thermometer 
outside Skibo shows a near-goal 
record, but this is due to the large 
oversubscriptions of the faculty 
and administration. Students de­
siring to contribute to the Chest 
who have not yet been contacted 
can do so in the Cashier’s Office.
The constitutional committee, 
headed by Dick Franklin, recom­
mended an amendment to the ef­
fect that Council be empowered to 
conduct investigations (such as 
Skibo) and make recommendations 
to the administration. A vote will 
take place next week.
Skibo Progress 
A preliminary progress report 
by the Council-sponsored Skibo 
investigation committee, headed by 
UAC member Wally Neilson, and 
composed of Dick Franklin, Fred 
Sonnenberg, and John Mayer, 
stated that to date the PCW and 
Pitt cafeterias, Scotty’s, the Clock, 
and other eating places in the 
area have been visited and that 
price and quality comparisons are 
being made.

fusing a request by the C Club for 
activities keys on the grounds of 
added expense, and because it was 
felt that varsity athletes receive 
enough recognition now. The

Third English Talk 
Next Tuesday 
On Czech Author
Mr. Richard C. Oswant will dis­
cuss the Czechoslovakian author, 
Franz Kafka, in the third English 
department lecture at 11:30 a.m. 
on Tuesday, November 27, in 
MMCC 103.
Franz Kafka, an early twentieth 
century author, wrote The Castle, 
The Trial, and America. These 
novels have all been translated 
into English. He also wrote sev­
eral short stories including The 
Penal Colony and Metamorphosis.
Kafka’s works were not pub­
lished until after his death, when 
his friend, Max Brod published 
them contrary to the instructions 
of the author. Brod has also edited 
and published Kafka’s diaries.

Editorials—
The Dead Horse May Die
There’s nothing like beating a dead horse to fill up space 
in a column, and Carnegie has two excellent examples— 
‘school spirit’ and ‘what’s wrong with Student Council.’ But 
this time we have a legitimate excuse, for there is some 
possibility that Council may soon become dead in fact and 
not in fancy.
The current petition calling for the dissolution of Coun­
cil, signed by 50 students and tabled as an amendment at 
the last Council meeting, has almost no chance of going 
farther since two-thirds of Council must vote affirmatively 
before an all school assembly can be held. But there is an­
other petition being circulated, and this one is aiming for 
the 150 signatures needed to call for an all school vote over 
the head of Council. The signers of both petitions presum­
ably feel that the activities of Student Council do not jus­
tify its existance.
There were nine people present to vote on the recent—and 
more important—Council amendment which reduced represen­
tative membership. But if it comes to an all school vote on the 
dissolution of Council, there may be standing room only in the 
Little Theater. Why? Because this shapes up as a glamorous 
show of force between the fraternities, which number all of the 
male members of Council among their membership, and dorm 
factions. Council will call on CFP or the supposedly disbanded 
Interfraternity Action Committee for aid, twelve fraternity 
presidents will be called on to ‘get out the vote,’ etc., etc. And 
we have a feeling that all the while the instigators of the peti­
tions will be laughing up their sleeves at the wonderful show of 
school spirit put on by a student body which usually doesn’t give 
a damn—dorm or fraternity alike.
If the present Council does deserve the ‘do-nothing’ tag, 
and we feel that it does not, those who signed the petitions 
are as much to blame as anyone. This student apathy toward 
anything but the sensational, coupled with a set of contra­
dictory ‘powers of Council,’ has brought continual discredit 
upon Council and its activities—witness the last election 
when seven people ran for seven vacancies, all fraternity 
men put up by IAC.
Student Council represents student control as directed 
by student opinion. Since the school exists for and by its 
students, those students should and can maintain a large 
measure of control over almost every phase of college life 
—with the qualification that this control be exercised by re­
sponsible people. Assuming democratic voting as the method 
of selection, we feel that responsibility can best be main­
tained by publicity, cooperation, and student interest.
Student Council won’t be dissolved. Legal or extra- 
legal means will be found to maintain the organization— 
even those who instigated the petitions must realize this. 
But how can Student Council be improved?
(l)
(2)
(3)
(4)
More interest. Let those who started the petitions stir up 
the dorm interest which once placed 14 out of 16 candidates 
on Council in a single election.
More publicity. The Tartan plans to give more intensive 
coverage to Council activities. Also, departing from the 
ostrich-like policy of the past, we will support in print 
those candidates we feel will best fill the needs of Council.
More Cooperation. This is up to Council—when and if dorm 
members face fraternity men across the table. Council 
should be used for the good of all students and not as a 
sounding board for petty gripes and jealousies.
More responsibility. Redefinition, clarification, and broaden­
ing of the powers of Council.
Student Council should be more than a sop thrown 
to the students by the administration—and the administra­
tion, as much as anyone, realizes this. But Council becomes 
just that when students are content to criticize their fown 
inactivity and still do nothing about it.

THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY
Letters to the Editor—
Factions Give Views 
In Council Controversy
Editor, the Tartan:
This letter is written to the ed­
itor of the Tartan to present the 
side of those who petitioned Stu­
dent Council to dissolve itself. The 
petition was not the result of an 
on-the-spot notion turned out 
merely to create an uproar. This 
same thought has been implicity 
current with the Tech students 
for several years; the phrase com­
mon to the situation has been “do- 
nothing Council,” at least once 
quoted in the Tartan.
The quote might well be 
brought to focus a little more di­
rectly if one examines the powers 
of Council as listed in its consti­
tution, Any unhurried examina­
tion of those powers will show 
that in terms of the present set up 
they are either totally governed 
by the administration with Coun­
cil acting as an intermediary, 
Council not acting, or the respon­
sibility of making a go of any one 
project turned over to some other 
organization on campus.
To illustrate (this from the SC 
constitution): “This Council shall: 
(c) Approve the budget of every 
all-school function sponsored by 
any campus organization whatso­
ever . . .” The facts, as taken from 
the Student Handbook: “. . . the 
coordination and supervision of 
all campus organizations and the 
handling of finances for all cam­
pus activities is handled by the 
Dean of Students and his two As­
sistant Deans.” We might also ask 
what might be the function of the 
Student Council social chairman 
and his committee — decidedly 
none.
We have reached the limit of 
what we’re allotted space to say, 
and not the limit of what we’ve 
got to say on this matter in total­
ity.

Editor, the Tartan:
Student Council is not an auton­
omous organization; it derives its 
authority from the student body. 
If a majority of students on the 
Carnegie campus desire to dissolve 
Council, to leave the conduct of 
all student affairs to the adminis­
tration, Council will be forced to 
obey their wishes.
Although the judgment may be 
wrong, Council does not believe 
the petition currently being cir­
culated for the dissolution of stu­
dent government reflects the ma­
jority of student opinion. How 
students who continually gripe 
about the little influence they have 
upon the conduct of student af­
fairs should want to give up the 
only voice they have is not imme­
diately comprehensible.
Contrary to some opinion, Coun­
cil does exercise some authority 
on campus. What has been and is 
being done this year is a matter of 
record. Council is proud of its rec­
ord and is not afraid to defend it
The Drinking: Problem
CIT Problem 
Not Unique
Other Schools Plagued 
By Drinking Troubles
During the last few weeks the 
problem of drinking on campuses 
has been popping up in many col­
lege newspapers throughout the 
country.
Up in New York, at Syracuse 
university, the campus leaders 
went on record last week as op­
posed to drinking on university 
property, and to disobeying regu­
lations pertaining to student use of 
alcoholic beverages.
Handle All Offenders
The group made two recom­
mendations to the administration 
on ways to alleviate the problem. 
They wanted a joint student-fac­
uity committee to investigate the 
drinking situation at university 
functions or on university proper­
ty; and a student court to have 
jurisdiction over offenders, both 
individuals and groups.
The movement at Syracuse came 
from a proposal of the national 
student government conference 
which called for student action to 
put teeth into often neglected reg­
ulations on campus drinking.
School Takes Over
Another issue of the Syracuse 
paper came out with an article on 
the enforcement of drinking reg­
ulations in the football stadium. 
The student government organiza­
tion, which is supposed to repre­
sent the students’ viewpoints on 
such issues, argued that its pur­
pose was only to be a liason com­
mittee between students and fac­
ulty.
The students, on the other hand, 
thought the only rules that would 
be enforced were the governing 
body’s. As a result, {he adminis­
tration now has assumed complete 
authority in the problem.

sion panel at Allegheny college

To those people who continually 
ask, “What is Council doing?” it 
is recommended they read the 
Tartan each week. The job of 
Student Council is not to provide a 
publicity sideshow for students, 
but rather to perform the necess­
ary functions for the representa­
tion of student opinion.

Court Of Justice 
Hantls Down First 
Non Rush Verdict
The Court of Justice of the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
handled its first trial recently for 
a case other than a violation of- a 
rushing rule.
Delta Tau Delta fraternity was 
charged with violations of the 
chaperone rules and sentenced to 
two weeks social probation and a 
$50 fine.
The Court also strongly recom­
mended in its findings that CFP 
immediately revise and reword its 
chaperone rules to eliminate mis­
understandings. One point of the 
case grew out of the interpreta­
tion of “recent alumnus.”
No clarification of the term ap­
peared in the rules, so the Court, 
left to its own interpretation, de­
cided that a graduate of the class 
of ’48 was recent. According to 
these rules, no recent alumnus 
may be a chaperone.
Another decision of the Court 
ruled that a graduate teaching as­
sistant cannot be a chaperone, un­
less he meets some other qualifica­
tion. \
After the decision was handed 
down, the Delts immediately ap­
pealed to CFP for another hear­
ing, contending that the penalty 
was too severe for such a viola­
tion. The Court decided that its 
first sentence would stand.

Henderson Appointed 
To Visiting Position
Alexander Henderson, interna­

been appointed visiting professor 
of economics at the Carnegie 
Graduate School of Industrial Ad­
ministration.
A former professor of economics 
at the University of Manchester, 
England, and the University of 
Edinburg, Scotland, Mr. Hender­
son came to this country last year 
as visiting professor of economics 
at the University of California.
He earned a bachelor of arts 
degree from the University of 
Cambridge in 1936 and his master 
of arts degree from the same uni­
versity in 1940 During World 
War II, he was on active duty with 
the British Armed Services.
A Rockefeller Fellow to the 
United States in 1946, Mr. Hen­
derson has written widely on 
problems of foreign trade, taxa­
tion, and prices. From 1948 to 
1950 he served on the British

ferment of any or all categories of 
persons whose activity in study is 
found to be necessary to the main­
tenance of the national health, 
safety, or interest.
The criteria for deferment as a 
student is either a satisfactory 
score (70) on the test or satisfac­
tory rank in class (upper half of 
the freshman class, upper two- 
thirds of the sophomore class, up­
per three-fourths of the junior 
class.)
Seniors accepted for admission 
to a graduate school satisfy the 
criteria if they stand in the upper 
half of their classes, or make a 
score of 75 or better on the test. 
Students already enrolled in 
graduate schools may be deferred 
so long as they remain in good 
standing. These criteria are mere­
ly guides and the local boards are 
not bound to follow them.

Grid Team Closes Successful Season
Defeats Westminster 
35-6 In Final Contest
Few Fans Brave Snow And Cold
To Watch Carnegie Win Handily
Dr. Eddie Baker’s Carnegie Tartans made it a 6—2 record for 
the year and closed their third straight successful season as they 
overwhelmed an outmanned but game Westminster eleven 35—6 at 
Forbes Field Saturday. ?----------------------------------------------------
Only a handful of fans braved 
the snow storm and below freez­
ing weather to watch Carnegie 
build a 21-0 lead in less than six 
minutes of the fii'st quarter and 
effectively settle the outcome of 
the game.
Lone Tally
Westminster didn’t score until 
the waning minutes of the game 
when Dick Bannick’s passes fin­
ally began to click for the Titans.
the goal line standing up for the 
final points of the period.
Deep in Westminster territory 
during most of the second canto, 
the Tartans failed to score. Fum­
bles and pass interceptions kept 
both teams from sustaining a pro­
longed touchdown drive.

bos removed any doubts of the 
game’s outcome as they quickly

The initial period proved West- j The last piaid touchdown came 
minster’s downfall as the Tartans ' on a 50 yard drive marked by pen- 
scored the first three times they alties and the ejection of two pug-
handled the ball. John Luchok, 
Tom Craig, and Fritz Wilson 
crossed the goal line for the Plaid 
as they struck with devastating 
swiftness.
Three Quick Ones
A Westminster fumble on the 
first running play of the contest 
set up the first TD. After Hans 
Lange had recovered the ball on 
the four yard line, Quent Holtz 
handed off to Luchok who ran 
wide around right end for the 
score. Gil Dissen kicked the first 
of five conversions without a miss.
A pass interception by Arne 
Oberg on the Westminster 39 led 
to the second Carnegie tally. On 
the third play from scrimmage, 
Holtz faded back for his first pass 
and hit end Tom Craig in the end 
zone for the touchdown.
The third score of the first per­
iod came as the Titans were forced 
to punt. Again on the third play 
Holtz went back to pass. The toss 
was good to Craig who lateralled 
to Fritz Wilson. Wilson went over
nacious Westminster players.
After Eddie Miller had passed 
complete to Shechter on the 15, it 
took two penalties on each team to 
bring the ball to the 12. Dale 
Startzell gained to the 7, and a 
Holtz to Craig pass connected for 
the final marker.
The final period was a repetition 
of the second as neither seemed to 
be able to score. Westminster’s 
drive in the closing second of the 
game provided the only excite­
ment. Coach Eddie Baker emptied 
his bench as he gave reserves 
needed experience for next year.
The Westminster game was last 
of the season for nine of the Tar­
tan gridders — Johnny Luchok, 
Quent Holtz, Arne Oberg, Ted 
Leaman, George Rusnak, Hans 
Lange, Dale Startzell, Fritz Wil­
son, and Bob Odeh. They made it 
a memorable one as the 35 points 
in the final game gave the Tartans 
a total of 219 for the season and
HOLTZ TO CRAIG TO WILSON
Carnegie scored its third touchdown Saturday against Westminster as Quent Holtz passed to Tom 
Craig who lateralled to Fritz Wilson. The dotted lines in the picture show the approximate path of 
the ball and the players although it really wasn’t a forward lateral.

the highest scoring record of any 
Tartan team since 1930.
In eight games this year the 
Tartans have outscored their op­
ponents by exactly 100 points. The 
totals show 219 points for Car­
negie and 119 for the opposition.
The Westminster game also 
marked the end of another win­
ning season for Coach Eddie Baker 
and his assistants—Eddie Hirsh- 
berger, Walt Burns, and A1 Irwin. 
Since Baker’s return to Carnegie 
in 1949, the’ Tartans have mark­

for a complete turnabout of the 
Skibo’s record immediately before 
1949.

125 Bulletin Boards 
Dot Carnegie Campus
By Dick Durstine
There is a wealth of miscellaneous and often irrelevant infor­
mation available for the interested student at a source which is some­
times overlooked in the quest of a broad education. These gems of 
wisdom lie in the various and sundry bulletin boards located on
the Carnegie campus.
A brief check of those boards in 
the class buildings, gym, and 
Skibo, as well as the two outside 
boards shows a total of over 125 
wells of hidden knowledge on cam­
pus. This does not include those 
in fraternity houses, dormitories, 
and similar buildings.
Need Distribution
Topics covered include operas, 
lectures, seminars, dances, break­
fasts, refrigerators, slide rules, 
concerts, typing of theses, assign­
ments, honor lists, demerit lists, 
pictures, job opportunities, and a 
multitude of other topics. Some 
boards are more than filled to ca­
pacity, while others are complete­
ly empty, a situation which it 
might be well for Student Council, 
APO, or some otner public spirited 
organization to look into.
Some bulletins relate to future 
events, but others cast a shadow 
on the distant past. There is avail­
able for the asking the address of 
a student who lost his slide rule 
the Friday before Easter vacation 
(year date not mentioned). We 
can also learn that veterans’ re­
quisitions are not valid after May 
19, 1951.

For those looking for work, there 
are positions open to persons in­

in the scientific and engineering 
fields are available.

•SUUCCT TO OP* REGULATIONS
By Df^ek di Salvo
By popular avoidance of the position I have been chosen as the 
new “Features Editor” of the Tartan. It is my task to elicit from a 
student body floating in the Limbo of Indifferentism—reactions; thus 
as a writer I hope to stir myself and you to thought and then per­
haps to action. Controversy is the*--------------------------------------------------—
key to all I want to say, for out of 
argument; out of controversy, re­
actions sometimes happen. My 
greatest joy will be acid letters to 
the Editor from you about this 
column; the neutralizer of appro­
bation will of course be appreci­
ated but not expected. This then is 
my First Epistle to the Ostriches 
of Carnegie Tech—so with a dic­
tionary in hand let us begin.
With Anxious Heart
For two years I have waited 
with anxious heart to see the Tar­
tan pose issues other than who has 
discovered a new electron hanging 
on the tail of infinity; what neo­
phyte in the Orders of Big Broth­
ers and Little Sisters accomplished 
what new feat accompanied by the 
time of In The Evening By The 
Moon Light—I’ve waited in vain. 
I’ve pondered over the pages of 
athletic and academic hurdles 
handled in the Tartan with eager 
eyes to see if someone had discov­
ered we were victims of the twen­
tieth century. My eyes are blurred 
and yet they read the same won­
derful college capers that shocked 
the twenties; thus I come into this 
academic journalistic w o r 1 d—I 
hope a breath of freshness; with 
loud cries that we are not students 
in a vacuum nor infants suspend­
ed in a womb of protected isola­
tion. Co-conspiritors of indiffer- 
entism be prepared!
A Catalyst
A university, and even a tech­
nological institution, I have al­
ways thought is not alone a store 
house—where all may clip an al- 
loted amount of coupons and then 
by the grace of a diploma collect 
some measure of financial achieve­
ment in this material world—a 
university, I believe, should be a 
catalyst which stirs each person­
ality to some degree of spiritual, 
social and intellectual activity. 
Into this Valhalla of Techniques I 
come; bearing a Pandora’s box—a 
box full of imps: social responsi­
bility, moral scrutiny, and spiritual 
inquiry. I realize the mentioning 
of God is unconstitutional and un­
scientific; so we shall dispense with 
the Author of us all by the rele­
gation of our Creator to the Mid­
dle Ages where He properly be­
longs; since social responsibility is 
the province of Communistic and 
Socialistic dogma we dare not 
speak of it, and thus my definition 
of a university is in peril—at least 
for the present.
man—a man rich in mechanical 
means but poverty stricken in the 
other means to control the mon­
sters he creates. We close this 
First Epistle to the twentieth cen­
tury—the Age of Atom Bombs— 
the Age of Anxiety—the Age in 
which we, the students of this 
bright new world, swinging on our 
evolutionary tales to the trees of 
indifferentism, escapism and in­
activity find ourselves going forth 
ill-prepared and ill-equipped with 
the Science God on our right 
hand; spewing atoms as our New 
Word and with the Book of Noth­
ing in our hands.

McKelway Attends Convention 
Of Evening School Association
CIT was represented at the annual meeting of the Association 
of University Evening Colleges this year by the Evening School 
Registrar, Mr. Daniel McKelway. The convention was held Novem­
ber 13 through November 15 at the Eook-Cadillac Hotel, Detroit, 
Michigan. ?—--------------------------—----------------
The AUEC was founded in 1939 
and holds annual conventions each 
year in November. The purposes 
of the Association, in the words 
of its constitution, are to study the 
problems of evening colleges, to 
interchange information and ideas 
among the members and to con­
duct other activities beneficial to 
the members.
The active participation of men 
whose offices in their respective 
institutions make them responsi­
ble for all sorts of evening edu­
cation programs has made each 
annual meeting a memorable 
event. The cooperation of its mem­
bers has contributed greatly to

Scabbard & Blade, the 
ROTC honorary is sponsoring 
the annual Military Ball on 
Saturday, Dec. 8, 9:00 to 1:00 
in the gymnasium. The music 
for the formal dance will be

the growth and development of 
collegiate eevening education in 
their communities.
Plii Gamma Pi 
Holds Annual Tea 
In Union Sunday
The annual Evening Student 
Council tea for women attending 
evening classes at Carnegie Tech 
was held Sunday, November 11, 
from 2:00 to 4:00 P.M. under the 
sponsorship of Evening Student 
Council. The tea was supervised 
by Phi Gamma Pi Sorority under 
the chairmanship of Gertrude Cal- 
lanan.
Maki speaker for the afternoon’s 
program was Mrs. Schwarz, who 
give a very entertaining and im­
pressive talk, telling about the 
seven weeks that were spent trav­
eling in Europe this past sum­
mer.
After the program, the girls ad­
journed to the dining room where 
a cornucopia serving as the cen­
terpiece carried out the Novem­
ber theme.
Sigma Delts 
Initiate Four 
New Members
Sigma Delta Phi held its month­
ly meeting Sunday, November 11. 
Four new members were initiated 
at an impressive ceremony con­
ducted by Mr. McDonald, advisor. 
They are: Matthew Bertovich,
William Bernhardy, Guy Mar- 
tinelli, and Regis Halecko.
Members are chosen based on a 
set of standards which have been 
adopted by the organization. The 
extending of bids and the pledging 
of new members is carried on in 
the usual manner, of social fra­
ternities.
A large number attended as 
usual and plans were made for 
future affairs. A Christmas Party 
was discussed and Charles Keller, 
social chairman, suggested a 
schedule of activities for the com­
ing year.
Plans for a Fraternity Hand­
book were also discussed and it 
was decided that an actual hand­
book would be much too expen­
sive. It was tentatively suggested 
that programs for the Christmas 
Party could have the names, ad­
dresses and phone numbers of the 
present members printed on them, 
along with a short history of the 
fraternity.

Define Parking Spaces 
Hoping To Ease Jam
Students attending night school are constantly being confronted 
by the problem of parking. To help alleviate this situation the fol­
lowing parking spaces are given.
Right angle parking on the park side is permitted on Frew 
Street, which runs parallel with*-----------------------------------------------------
Porter Hall. Spaces are marked 
on the street, and no parking is 
permitted beyond the lines. Par­
allel with the Gym and Margaret 
Morrison Street, from Margaret 
Morrison Building to Forbes 
Street. A parking lot on the upper 
level of the “Cut” is available. The 
entrance is from Forbes Street 
above the shelter at Morewood. 
Another lot is located near the 
F.P.H.A. housing units, entering 
from Margaret Morrison Street.

LUCKIES 
TASTE BETTER!
It takes fine tobacco to give you a better- 
tasting cigarette. And Lucky Strike 
means fine tobacco. But it takes some­
thing else, too—superior workmanship. 
You get fine, light, mild, good-tasting 
tobacco in the better-made cigarette. 
That’s why Luckies taste better. So, Be 
Happy—Go Lucky! Got a carton today!
STUDENTS!
Let’s go! We want your jingles! We’re 
ready and willing and eager to pay 
you $25 for every jingle we use. Send 
as many jingles as you like to Happy- 
Go-Lucky, P. O. Box 67* New Ycrk 
46, N. Y.
Also there is a parking location to 
the right of Machinery Hall, which 
will accommodate a limited num­
ber of cars.
The streets listed are public 
thorofares and, therefore, are 
subject to city and state parking 
regulations. The usual precaution* 
should be taken.
You are reminded to carry your 
registration receipt with you as 
identification to permit entry to 
school parking areas. Identifica­
tion will be necessary when spec­
ial sports or civic events in Oak­
land can cause overflow of cars in­
to the school lots
Further information pertaining 
to these parking regulations at 
Tech may be found by referring to 
Page 85 of the Carnegie Hand­
book.

Misfortunes have been plaguing 
Bill Burton at Tech this Fall. Sev­
eral weeks ago his car was stolen 
from its parking spot in front of 
Porter Hall on Frew Street. Luck­
ily he recovered the car several 
days later, slightly worse for wear
Then, while attending the Tech- 
Lehigh game on November 10, hi# 
wife tripped and broke her leg at 
Forbes Field. He has temporarily 
left his studies here to be both 
mother and father to his two chil­
dren. We extend our wishes for an 
early recovery for Mrs. Burton.
Credit goes to the people who 
designed the novel poster for the 
Monte Carlo Carnival. Mary May, 
Marcella Sessi, Kathy Galligan, 
Donald Walker ^ind Harry Lin­
coln are the clever artists.
Weren’t some of those White 
Elephant prizes at the Monte Car­
lo Carnival surprizing? Some 
really useful articles were auc­
tioned off for just a few paltry 
hundred dollars!

Lectures of Interest
Fbr the lecture goers, there are 
such topics offered as “The Brown- 
Boveri High-Speed Air-Blast Cur­
rent Breaker,” as well as other 
topics of current interest.
Politics are in the air, with 
freshman election campaign post­
ers still hanging on the walls. In 
FA, we find President Warner’s 
announcement of last year con­
cerning the draft. Also available 
is information on weddings of Car­
negie graduates and efficiency rat­
ings of machinery in the engineer­
ing labs.
Bulletins Needed
There are, therefore, plenty of 
bulletins to put on our bulletin 
boards; they are just not very well 
distributed.
The leading building in bulletin
board space is the AH-PH combi­
nation. There are 30 under one 
roof there. EH runs a close second 
with 29. MMCC, FA, and MH each 
have nearly 20, many of which, i 
however, are devoid of bulletins. 
Students who have bulletins for* 
these empty boards should send' 
them to “Bulletins, Box 288, CIT.”

Two Carnegie Men 
Receive Army Awards
In recognition of their technical 
services during World War II, the 
Department of the Army has 
awarded a certificate of apprecia­
tion to 23 scientists and research- 
men from Western Pennsylvania.
From Carnegie Tech, Homer H. 
Lowry of the Coal Research Lab­
oratory, Robert T. Mehl of the 
metallurgical engineering depart­
ment, and Carl C. Monrad of the 
chemical engineering department 
received certificates.
Presentation of the awards was 
made on Friday, October 26, at the 
Organized Reserve Corps Center in 
Pittsburgh by a representative of 
the Commanding General of the 
Second Army.
The Woodlawn Pharmacy, pur­
veyor of all manner of goods es­
sential to the Carnegie student, is 
offering a free television set to 
some fortunate person. The give­
away will be in the form of a lot­
tery, with tickets being given to 
patrons with each 25 cent purchase 
at the drugstore.
Located at the corner of Forbes 
and Margaret Morrison streets, the 
store is a proverbial hangout for 
dorm men, as well as various and 
sundry other students. Consider­
ing the bulk of material available 
at the pharmacy, and the buying 
power of today’s quarter, the ac­
quisition of tickets should be a 
thing of no difficulty, and perhaps 
of great good fortune to some 
lucky patron.
