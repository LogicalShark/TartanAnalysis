Stever’s Oratory Remains Unclear
by Jeff Ruben
Speaking before a polite but unenthusiastic gathering 
of about 600 in the Skibo Ballroom on Tuesday, President
H. Guyford Stever raised a number of pertinent questions 
regarding the nature of the University. He failed to pro­
vide answers to these questions, however, and to the dis­
appointment of many students in the crowd, he declined 
to take questions from the floor at the conclusion of his 
speech.
Dr. Stever began by discussing the history of universi­
ties, pointing out that ideas should not be regarded as ob­
solete simply because they are old. Touching on the events 
of recent weeks. Dr. Stever declared that the University 
should be an intellectual agent, not a moral or political 
one. He made the point that the University must represent 
all of its students, not just the activist minority. Dr. Stev­
er also raised the possibility that academic freedom and 
institutional autonomy might not exist in a politically ori­
ented university.
After speaking of his own constrainments as president, 
Stever hinted that he would take moral stands as an in­
dividual in the near future. He did have some stern words 
for student activists, however. He argued that they must 
take responsibility for their actions, and he less-than- 
subtly intimated that a financial crisis affecting C-MU 
students might occur if demonstrations were to continue.
Dr. Stever stated that the purpose of his speech was to 
propose basic questions about C-MU and to ask the Uni­
versity community to consider their answers. It seems 
that the president was trying to move C-MU from the po­
litical battleground back to a university perspective. He 
volunteered to set up meetings in which the issues con-
PRESIDENT H. GUYFORD STEVER
fronting the University might be discussed.
Without TV cameras to precipitate nervousness, this 
speech obviously was better presented than the Sept. 22 
debacle. However, Dr. Stever left an unpleasant taste in 
the mental mouths of many students, who still felt that 
the position of the University on several vital issues re­
mains unclear. Dr. Stever’s failure to answer questions 
raised by students also left an impression that he is some­
what afraid to take a stand on the issues about which the 
students are concerned. As Dr. Stever left the stage, the 
shouted question of one student was drownded out by ap­
plause and went unanswered.
Student Senate Adopts Policy for Skibo 
Admits Off-compus Students and Guests
The following policy was passed by Student Senate 
Tuesday.
We, the Student Senate of Carnegie-Mellon University, 
do adopt the following policy for the use of Skibo and its 
facilities:
“Skibo facilities are only open to Carnegie-Mellon stu­
dents, faculty, staff, alumni and thier guests.”
The following procedures will be used to protect this 
privilege:
1. Any student, faculty, staff or alumnus of C-MU 
should have proper University identification and should be 
prepared to make evident such, if requested by Skibo per­
sonnel.
2. Any of the above listed may bring guests on cam­
pus and into Skibo. Guest identification cards will be avail­
able in Skibo 103, at the Information Desk.
3. Students from other colleges and universities, with 
proper identification, are welcome on campus and in 
Skibo.
4. A non-college student, who is not attending a sched­
uled program, or is not a guest, is not permitted on cam­
pus or access to Skibo.

by J. S. Langer, Chairman of the Faculty Senate
Following completion of the main business at the spe­
cial Senate meeting on Sept. 30,1 asked the faculty to con­
sider our response to a probable request for University 
participation on Oct. 15 in the nation-wide protest against 
the Vietnam War. Since our meeting, several things have 
happened. The Student Senate has requested that classes 
be cancelled on that day, and a number of you have writ­
ten to me urging that the faculty make the same request. 
On Thursday, Oct. 2, I participated in an informal discus­
sion with President Stever and a number of the vice-presi- 
dents and deans. It was the consensus of that group that 
C-MU ought to remain open on the 15th but that the facil­
ities of the University should be made available for lec­
tures, discussion groups, and other activities related to 
the Vietnam question. I believe that that consensus will 
have become an official administrative decision by the 
time this letter reaches you. I agree with the decision and 
want to take this opportunity to explain my reasoning.
As most of you know, I am very much opposed to pre­
sent United States policies in Vietnam. I am convinced 
that our military intervention in that country is a serious 
mistake which must be clearly acknowledged and correct­
ed without delay. It seems to me absolutely essential that 
the United States turn immediately to the job of repairing 
the immense damage we have caused, both with our 
bombs and by our neglect of urgent human problems at 
home and abroad. I therefore enthusiastically support the 
general plans of the Oct. 15 movement. I intend to partici­
pate in the activities of that day and I hope that many of 
you will do likewise.
Despite my whole-hearted support of the Oct. by activ­
ities, however, I remain opposed to official cancellation of 
classes or any other action which would put the University 
in the position of using its educational program to advo­
cate one side of a current political issue. History teaches 
us that it is in time of crisis that we must be most alert to 
the preservation of civil liberties and academic freedom 
is among the most precious of these liberties. I am very 
much afraid that the cancellation of classes by order of 
the University administration or trustees, as a gesture of 
dissent against the Vietnam War, might set a dangerous 
precedent for misuse of our educational functions. I cer­
tainly want to preserve my own right to speak freely on is­
sues and I also defend students’ rights to miss my classes 
in order to participate in political activities. But under no 
circumstances do I want political aspects of our educa­
tional program to be established by administrative order.
Although the distinction is a fine one, it does not seem 
to me that this argument on grounds of academic free­
dom is in any way inconsistent with the principle that the 
University must, on certain occasions, take specific, 
meaningful action in public affairs. I am thinking, obvi­
ously, of our present problems regarding racial discrim­
ination in the construction unions. Here, I have argued and 
shall continue to argue that our extensive construction 
projects put us in a position where we can exert meaning­
ful pressure and that our moral obligation to the commun­
ity requires us to do so. Failure to take advantage of an 
opportunity for action in this case would be an effective 
support of the status quo.
In the case of the Vietnam protests on Oct. byJ how­
ever, the issue rests with the faculty and students, and not 
with the administration. The success of the program will 
be determined entirely by the individuals who participate 
and not by the strength of official administrative support.
5. Increased internal security in Skibo.

"Neutral Role" 
Called A Myth
Editor, The Tartan:
I agree with Professor Grif­
fiths that a politicized campus in­
volves a threat to the equanimity 
of those who may dissent from a 
prevailing position (e.g., support 
for the BCC). I agree that there 
would be danger in the university’s 
taking stands casually on every 
passing issue.
I believe we disagree, however, 
about how well the university has 
been able to maintain a “neutral, 
objective” role. It might be desir­
able for the university to be an ivo­
ry tower, but in fact it is increas­
ingly the case that the direction 
of faculty research is determined 
by grant-givers, that whole pro­
grams and colleges—in humnities 
as well as the sciences—are deter­
mined by the question of where to 
get the funds, that the knowledge 
output of universities is often ap­
plied by political government to 
ends repugnant to most faculty 
(witness the technical know-how 
that fires the Vietnam War). Neu­
trality is a myth.
This may still not be an argu­
ment that the university should 
attempt to speak out as a corpor­
ate body on every issue. Certainly 
it will often be appropriate for in­
dividual faculty to examine the 
effect of their work and to sup­
port positions taken through their 
professional organizations. Some­
times, however, it is clear that the 
university—behind its facade of 
neutrality—has taken a corporate 
position already: in the instance 
of the recent labor disputes in 
Pittsburgh, the university is a con­
tracting party to labor practices 
that are morally, perhaps legally, 
unjust. It it then not appropriate 
for the University to examine its 
corporate conscience and arrive 
at a more equitable position?
Professor Griffiths concludes 
by asking for a statement of prin­
ciples as to what issues we can 
properly ask the university to 
take a stand on. The principles, I 
would hope, are those of counsel­
ing together as a campus (as we 
did during the week of the demon-

Right to Learn
Editor, The Tartan:
As a student in the Drama De­
partment, I would like to object to 
the cancellatin of classes on Oct. 
15. For one thing, I do not agree 
with the objectives of the Mora­
torium, and this action implies 
that the whole department is be­
hind this. It cannot claim to speak 
for me. Secondly, class time is 
limited enough as it is; there is 
much to learn and little time to 
learn it. If a person wishes to cut 
a class of his own volition, this is 
his own choice and his own prob­
lem. But when this decision is 
made for me, and I am denied the 
only right I have here — the right 
to learn—I must object.

Editor, The Tartan:
We the undersigned hereby pub­
licly declare our thanks to Presi­
dent Stever for his clear explana­
tion of the position of the Univer­
sity on Tuesday, Oct. 7—namely 
that that position is questionable. 
We deplore President Stever’s 
lack of receptivity to the ques­
tions many wished to ask him and 
the lack of desire to promote a 
free interchange of views between 
the students and the administra­
tion. We are indeed unfortunate to 
have as president a man who is so 
unconscious of the problems fac­
ing today’s universities.

Editor, The Tartan:
On Monday evening, Oct. 6, the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents

that which Student Government 
had passed concerning the Mora­
torium planned for Oct. 15. The 
Council granted passage believing 
the proposal to be a fine ides in 
substance, but a few members

found the clause somewhat ob­
jectionable that states “whereas 
the university has dismally fail­
ed fulfill its obligation of educa­
tion on exactly those important 
topics ...” Adoption of an identi­
cal resolution, however, was seen 
as important to emphasize the$ 
campus-wide concern for the is­
sues and feeling of a need for this 
type of thing. Hence, the resolu­
tion was adopted verbatim. Per­
haps in the ensuing Moratorium 
this type of question as well as na­
tional concerns can be hashed out.

H & SS Drags
Editor, The Tartan:
While I was reading about 
H&SS Reforms in Tuesday’s Tar­
tan, I was very surprised to learn 
that C-MU students make Histor­
ical Understanding classes drag, 
so H&SS wants its own personal ij 
classes. Perhaps Historical Un­
derstanding, like all history class­
es, drags because of its own 
weight, but that’s not really the 
point.
I am a C-MU student who is 
mixed in with H&SS students in 
Historical Understanding. I’ll 
grant that H&SS students usually 
lead the discussion, but I hasten 
to add that there are other H&SS 
students I haven’t heard speak all 
year. And this is in a course which 
bases about 50 per cent of the 
grade on class participation. But, 
of course, H&SS is on pass-fail, 
and they don’t have to sweat it 
out, while I’ve got to make a de­
cent grade in a 12 unit course.
By all means, give H&SS stu­
dents their own Historical Under­
standing classes, if only to get 
them out of mine.

Senate Elections Set
Tuesday and Wednesday, Nov­
ember fourth and fifth, have been 
announced as the dates for the 
fall Student Government elec­
tions, according to Senate Rules 
Chairman, Bill Iacono, Twenty 
one Student Senate seats will be 
opened for election in the follow­
ing constituencies:
Fraternities 3 seats 
Graduate Students — 8 seats* 
Men’s Dorms — 3 seats 
AWS (all women undergradu­
ates) — 4 seats 
Independant Male Commuters
— 6 seats*
*Two seats in these constitu­
encies are open only until the 
April elections ... all other seats 
are open for one year terms.
Positions for the open Senate 
seats will be available in Ski­
bo 103 on Monday, Oct. 13th.
To run for Senator, a candidate 
must be a full time undergradu­
ate or a graduate student. He must 
be a member of a vonstituency 
which he desires to represent. To 
be listed on the ballot, each 
qualified candidate must submit 
a petition that contains the signa­
tures of at least 25 full time stu­
dents (graduate or undergradu-
ate), each of whom has not sign­
ed any other petition on behalf of 
a candidate for the Senate from 
his constituency. The petition 
must be submitted by October
23, to Skibo 103.
Freshmen are particularly ur­
ged to take this opportunity to 
voice their opinions through en- 
volvement in the Student Govern­
ment. Student Government pre­
sently controls the allocation of 
funds for student and campus so­
cial activities with a budget of 
$85,000. It is the voice of the Stu­
dent Government that is heard by 
the Administration, and represen­
tative of the Studeng Body, in 
policy making decisions. The 
concerns and envolvements of 
Students Government are far- 
reaching . . . From the Black 
Coalition to the October 15 
Moratorium, Student Government 
is speaking out. The views of the 
students need to be heard in these 
matters and i all future areas of 
concern.
This is your chance to run for 
and participate in an active 
legislative body — your opportun­
ity for involvement and response.
City Engineers Close 
Morewood East Side
On September 30, the Pitts­
burgh Bureau of Traffic Engineer­
ing announced that the east side 
of Morewood Avenue between 
Fifth and Forbes would no longer 
be available for parking. The 
“no parking” dictum has already 
gone into effect, as of October
1.
This decision is based on a re­
cent finding that the bridge on 
Forbes Street (immediately west 
of the Bureau of Mines) needs
Having approved a total of 
$5,000 for the African Sympos­
ium and color photography in 
the Thistle, the Finance Com­
mittee suddenly had an attack of 
miserliness and recommended 
that the Sailing Club’z request for 
$423 be turned down. God’s in 
his heaven, however, and the 
appropriations were passed over 
the veto of the Executive Coun­
cil.
The issue at stake here in­
volves a great many activities be­
sides the Sailing Club. If new 
activities cannot get a govern­
ment subsidy to cover their in- 
Jtial expenses, then the range of 
activities open to C-MU stu­
dents will be considerably nar­
rowed. As Dean Swank remark­
ed, the Senate will not be using 
monies set aside for such organiza-

some repairs. There is no infor­
mation available at this time as 
to just how long it will take to 
repair the bridge.
City buses will detour on More­
wood Ave. It is difficult for them 
to navigate Morewood with 
parking on the east side.
There is some possibility that 
the privilege of parking on the 
east side of Morewood will not 
be restored after the bridge is 
repaired. The City Traffic En­
gineer believes that this will re­
duce the danger of crossing the 
street between the frats and the 
girls’ dorm.
The following was approved by 
the Executive Committee of the 
Faculty Senate at its meeting on 
October 7,1969:
In recognition of the urgency 
of halting the war in Vietnam, 
and in commemoration of Octo­
ber 15 — a day on which hundreds 
of colleges and universities 
throughout the nation will alter 
their normal activities — the Ex­
ecutive Committee of the Facul­
ty Senate calls the attention of 
members of the Faculty of Car- 
negie-Mellon University to the 
activities planned on our campus 
for that day.
An unusual collection of films 
on the war has been gathered for 
showing on the morning of Oct-
ober 15. Dramatic productions 
will run at various times dur­
ing the morning and afternoon, 
and panels of faculty and students 
from several disciplines will ap­
pear on the morning and after­
noon programs. Topics to be dis­
cussed include the university and 
the war, the impact on science, 
strategies for a settlement, the 
policy of interventionism, resis­
tance and the draft. A proces­
sion from Freedom Corner (Craw­
ford and Centre Aves.) by stu­
dents and faculty from the 
many colleges and universities 
in the area will begin in the late 
afternoon as a slimax to the day’s 
events. Speakers of national 
eminence are expected to be in 
Pittsburgh to address this assem-
bly in the early evening.
We urge that each member of 
the Faculty, exercising indivi­
dual choice, participate in these 
activities in a manner consistent 
with his or her own sense of aca­
demic freedom and responsibility.

Gamma Sigma Sigma Seeks Donors 
Giving Pint Of Blood Not Terrifying
The following letter was sent to 
the TARTAN last year. It may con­
vince you that giving a pint of blood 
or donating an extra pint of blood 
if you gave last year isn't such a 
terrible thing.
Editor, efR eaoSapY
It takes much convincing to per­
suade anyone of anything nowa­
days, and even more so on this 
campus. A case in point is the 
Blood Donor Drive. At last report 
I believe only 50 or so persons had 
signed up. Perhaps in part I can 
help the cause.
Two summers ago while work­
ing for a well-known game-manu­
facturing company a date was an­
nounced for all the employees of
said company to donate blood at 
the local Red Cross unit. I decided 
to sign up, not su much to be a 
good person, as to receive a half­
day off with pay—I’ll be honest. 
Having heard many times what 
the experience was like from may 
parents who also had helped at 
Red Cross Blood Donor Day op­
erations I decided to keep up sort 
of a family tradition.
It was all in all a very reward­
ing happening. After a thorough 
check-up :of a rudimentary sort) 
I was cleared and sat awaiting an 
empty table. Once the needle was 
injected the whole operation took 
less than a half hour, and thence 
proceeded to a pleasant few mo­
ments where juice and doughnuts

were served. At no time was any 
pain involved — with the excep­
tion of a cold thermometer stuck 
in my mouth — and absolutely no 
side-effects were felt.
The only thing which reminded 
me of the experience was a band- 
aid on my arm for a day or so. A 
little altruistic of me to say, but 
still true, it was a pleasant though 
that my blood might save a child’s 
life. After all, the body remakes 
any lost blood in a short time, and 
so know one is the worse for wear.
I urge all Tech students to seri­
ously consider taking a half hour 
of their time to help the Red Cross. 
After all, it won’t hurt and you 
may even miss a class or two. 
Please, if anyone would like fur­
ther information, contact the peo­
ple whose names are on posters 
all over campus.

time. Credit will be given to their 
blood club.

No Virginia, that’s not that the stomach-like-a-bowl-full-of-jelly 
laughter of that fat jackal, Santa Claus. The news is not that of a hack­
neyed perennial, but rather of the millenium. You must, of course, 
know that I make allusion to the life, and recent death, of the muchly 
lionized H. C. Minh. The world community, beneficiary of his unique 
talenst, has suffered a grevious loss at his passing. At the risk of this 
becoming a maudlin eulogy of his epic contributions. The anestt^sia of 
sorrow and shock hasn’t worn off, so the portrait will suffer from pene­
trating numbness.
It boggles the mind to imagine the profound effect this slight, in­
scrutable man had on us. Rightly and ironically, Mr. Minh had humble 
proletarian beginnings. Just like George Wallace, Joey Stalin and 
Adolph Hitler, and like these three he had the same love of humanity 
and libertarian impetus. Superficially, what set Minh apart from the 
rest is not the fact that he held sway over the hearts and citizens of a 
world power, but that his notoriety came from relative obscurity—thou­
sands of miles away from the seats of power. It’s sort of like the mayor 
of Point Barrow, Alaska, influencing everybody’s sexual habits with a 
stand on birth control. So much for the usual favorable comparison with 
the world’s other great moguls.
What was it that really set this man apart from his contempor­
aries? I would argue that it was a matter of style. His modest start and 
phenomenal rise was accompanied by a pervasive joie de vivre. Add to 
that'just downright class. Let me clarify this by example. Minh was an 
assistant tmthe chief escoffier (who, by the way, just lead a palace re­
volt at Ritter’s Diner). After that he never relinquished the salivary 
and olfactory stimulation of the culinary artist. Sort of an oriental Dun­
can Hines. One can just picture him sitting down to dine on roast duck 
or the like. Contrast this with the peasant murders of the White House— 
Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy. A dinner there would be with freshly garrot- 
ed children and washed down with the hepatitis-ridden blood of draft re­
sistors. And Mr. Minh had a favorite dish he liked to foist upon his be­
loved countrymen—Communish.
Being the suasive connoissuer, he subtlely convinced, those too 
timid to taste the sweet pleasure. Jolly Mr. Minh would say, “Giap, 
take some of my fellow citizens and show them my other favorite dish 
—coup de grace.” Said his fun loving side-kick Giap, “Ah, excellent 
taste H. C. baby! Shall I take ten or 20?” Those were the good olde days 
when everybody played by Marquis of Queensxury rules.
And Minh’s distinctive flair was not limited to the kitchen either. 
He met with success on the field of battle. Though he despised the 
senselessness of war, his cleverness knew no limit. He invented a de­
vice to make his soldiers disappear at a moment’s notice. Not too much 
is known about this device, other than it’s secret code name—LAOS. 
Together with Nasser of Egypt he developed another instrument to pro­
tect his cities from the kill-crazy bombers. This, too, had a code name- 
tgo0h gsnpngp. And innovating from that gentle soul, Sitting Bull, he em­
ployed another weapon on the belligerent South Vietnames. This, of 
course, was the iallacoR g6 MrR. Here his army paralyzed the City of 
Hue by dumping tons of roses (left over from the Rose Bowl Parade) on 
its inhabitants.
His demise brough forth emotional response even on our sylvan 
campus. The mourners structured a quaint monument to Mr. Minh. 
That was the embodiment of the paint-stained Warner Hall. This silent 
tribute was carried over to the sidewalks, so that with the soles of our 
feet we could touch the soul of the tribute. And my what stirring shibbo­
leths were employed to honor his memory. “Vietnames Women Fight.” 
Brings a poignant tear to your eye, doesn’t it? Too bad the rent-a-cops 
happen along before his disciples could finish it with “Perspiration 
Odor.”
So now H. C. has gone to his reward. The void he has left crys for 
someone of equally great stature. The world can ill afford the loss of 
Minh—just when it seemed on the brink of insanity. Maybe some funny 
farm has an inmate the world could borrow in Minh’s stead.
Hours Not Extended
qv “Rpn6Ro VnTqv
Responding to a recent article 
in the eaoSap (Oct. 7) about ex­
tended hours for the Library, Ken­
neth Fagerhaugh, head librarian, 
has asked how tmbe heard. Mr. 
Fagerhaugh made up a fact sheet 
which gives the history of the li­
brary hours, and illustrates why 
the present system is the most 
feasible.
Last year, said Fagerhaugh, 
Library experimented with later 
hours during the week, at the re­
quest of Student Government. 
During December and January 
the library remained open until 
3 a.m. Population counts were 
taken regularly and showed sharp 
drops at about 1:15 to 1:30 a.m. 
The December average was as 
low as 18 people in the building, 
aside from the staff needed to 
man the several floors.
Support for staying open from 
11:45 to 12:45. however, seam­
ed sufficient, so the library insti­
tuted this policy.
The library administration, 
continuing the hours-of-opening ex­
periment, opened at 11 a.m. on 
Sunday because of some scattered 
requests for an opening before 2 
p.m. Population counts were so 
low until 1 p.m. that the continua­
tion of the 11 o’clock opening could 
not be justified.
Friday and Saturday evenings 
were also experimented with, but 
the usage made of the library af­
ter 5 was so slight that there were 
often only a few more using the li­
brary than were working in it to 
keep it open.
Mr. Fagerhaugh pointed out 
that it was not simply a matter of 
finance that contributed to the 
hours decisions, but also consider­
ation of how much energy and 
money lfgr0h be directed to serve 
a very small number of readers.

Friday, October 10, 1969—THE TARTAN—Page 5Workshop Proposals For New College
(Ed. Note: The following is a 
report prepared in July, 1969 by 
David Demarest, John Hayes, 
Orlando Dardini and James Korn 
of the Danforth Workshop for the 
new H & SS College.
Our experience at the Danforth 
Workshop — both as we consult­
ed as a “team” with well-known 
faculty and administrators and 
as we attended seminars indivi­
dually — helped us to develop 
proposals in four areas:
1) Evaluation
2) Teaching
3) Black students and studies
4) Procedures and curriculum.
1) Evaluation.
When C-MU’s new college of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
admits it first freshman class this 
fall, it will initiate several new 
features that have provoked con­
troversy among faculty and stu­
dents, including:
a) the fact that the freshman 
courses are largely prescribed.
b) The nature of the courses to 
be taught — are they “academic­
ally respectable?”
c) One pass-fail grade for the 
entire years as opposed to the 
traditional 5-point system.
d) The preceptorial advisory 
system — the “free seminar” in 
which one faculty member 
meets with 10-12 students without 
any prescribed subject matter.
Since the committee that de­
signed the new college did not 
intend it to be fixed and un­
changeable, a number of steps 
have already been taken toward 
an evaluation procedures:
a) An evaluation committee ad­
visory to the Dean has been form­
ed.
b) Part of the responsibility 
of the committees designing 
each course is to devise procedures 
for evaluating that course.
c) New courses for the fresh­
man year have been tested.
d) Departments have been 
asked to develop procedures for 
teacher evaluation (the infor­
mation to be used by promo­
tion committees).
Conversations with our consul­
tants (Mayhew, Keeton, Katz) 
have convinced us that these steps 
toward evaluation are too hap­
hazard, not comprehensive enough. 
We therefore propose that the 
college take these steps:
a) That a committee be ap­
pointed to design a comprehen­
sive evaluation scheme for 
the new college (this group might 
include some members from the 
present committee but must add 
members to be representative of 
the whole college).
This committee should consi­
der such steps as:
i) establishment of a separate 
evaulation department, office, 
and staff
ii) a plan for both short and long 
term evaluation of course objec­
tives and techniques

D’Ambrosi, a 1969 graduate of the 
C-MU Chemical Engineering De­
partment, was recently designated

his Engineer Officers Basic 
Course Class at the United States 
Army Engineer School. Fort Bel- 
voir. Virginia Lt. D’Ambrosi fin­
ished first in a class of 110 offi­
cers.
iii) a plan for teacher evalua­
tion
iv) a plan for evaluation of stu­
dents that considers alternatives 
like standard grading vs. pass- 
fail and comprehensive exams vs. 
exams in specific course settings.
Via plan for revising both goals 
and means for promoting innova­
tion. One suggestion is that we 
set up a fund to finance innova­
tions.
b) That we establish a budget 
for evaluation (estimates are that 
a comprehsneive evaluation 
program costs 5 - 10 per cent of 
total college operating costs) and 
that we seek foundation support 
for underwriting this venture.
2) Teaching.
Although most of our formal 
team effort has gone into the 
problem of evaluation, much of 
the general discussion at the 
conference was about the tradi­
tional failure of universities to 
promote and reward good tea­
ching, a failure that seems re­
lated to student charges that the 
academy and academics are ir­
relevant. We feel that there is 
malaise at C-MU on this topic, 
and propose that:
a) the college and its depart­
ments establish a clearer public 
position in support of rewards — 
salary, promotion, tenure for tea­
ching
b) new staff be hired with 
priority on commitment to tea­
ching, with emphasis on quality 
of prior teaching
b) new staff be hired with 
priority on commitment to tea­
ching, with emphasis on quality 
of prior teaching
c) the college support the pub­
lication of salary scales with 
AAUP and publication locally 
by an appropriate faculty com­
mittee
d) a new college professor­
ial chair be established for a 
“University Professor” — a dis­
tinguished teacher who would 
not be anchored to any depart­
ment and who might teach spec­
ial interdisciplinary topics
e) exchange teaching programs 
be established both with local 
and more distant colleges
f) within the on-going course 
program more team teaching 
and interdisciplinary work be 
encouraged.
3) Black Students and Studies
Our conversations at the con­
ference convince us anew of the 
urgency of the problems of Black 
students and Black studies. Black 
studies are most properly initiat­
ed by individual departments. 
Currently, only a few courses are 
offered in this area. The number 
of such courses certainly should 
be increased.
In addition, there are a num­
ber of steps we can take to com­
mit ourselves further to Black 
Students. We recommend that:
a) we continue to expand our 
enrollment of Black under­
graduates, having as our goal a 
minimum of 10-) 5 per cent of the 
college enrollment. We should re­
new our commitment to accept 
“hish-risk” students and to make 
such alterations in the curriculum 
as may seem necessary.
b) We investigate special pro­
grams for Black graduate stu­
dents:
i) All departments should look 
again at the idea of the year­
long, post-B.A. prep program for 
Negroes (probably southern) 
who want to go on to graduate 
school. (C-MU has had some ex­
perience in this area, particul­
arly in History. The whole col­
lege should now-re-examine this 
matter.
ii) The college should seek sup­
port for full (four year) doctoral 
programs that would involved not 
only course work but perhaps a 
year’s work in ghetto schools or 
organizations and some work with 
Black undergraduates on campus.
iii) The new college should 
aim throughout its departments’ 
graduate programs for a minimum
c) The new college intensify its 
efforts to recruit Black faculty. 
These faculty could include mem­
bers of the community who do not 
have the traditional academic 
credentials.
d) The new college study ex­
change programs with Black in­
stitutions, for both students and 
faculty.
e) There be consideration giv­
er. to establishing a student- 
faculty committee that would ser-
lo intiiate new Black programs.
4! Procedure and Curriculum.
Many ideas occured in our 
conversations that we feel are 
important and should be in- 
cluaed in planning for the new
college.
a) A continuing concern in 
the new college has been the 
role of Modern Languages. We 
recommend that a study be made
of programs for providing a stu­
dent a summer, a semester, or 
a year abroad.
b) Students should be allowed 
to petition for courses. If as many 
as 15 students agreed to enroll in 
such a course, it should be of­
fered regardless of the proposed 
content or format, assuming that 
appropriate instructional facili­
ties are available.
c> The new college should ex­
plore the possibilities of making 
whole areas of the student’s pro­
gram open to his determination — 
for instance, an entire year in 
whi^h the student might take 
any course in the catalog or per­
haps do some independent pro­
ject.
d* A course in “communica­
tion-' should be offered in which 
students are trained in such

media as film, audio and video 
tape: this should be supplement­
ed by a course in the history

ei In keeping with the spirit 
of the metacurriculum, the new 
college should make more use of

subjects of study; its organiz­

to weld the culturally diverse,

or with modes of random or open

Few of us while students at 
C-MU get much of an oppor­
tunity to speak to adults who are 
outside of the academic com­
munity. At times many of us feel 
a genuineneed to communicate 
with the older generation, but 
our desires are thwarted by their 
absence from our campus. The 
gentleman in the above picture, 
Bill O’Neil, is here to remedy 
that unfortunate situation.

Judging will be done by a 
jury of advertising executives 
and will be based on originality,
young people at Point State 
Park. After requests by C-MU 
students and the approval of Mr. 
McCurdy, Manager of the Cam­
pus Activities Center, Bill set up 
“office” in Skibo in an attempt 
to help young people with problems 
they might have. He now visits 
the campus seven days a week in 
the afternoons and evenings, 
and is seen sitting informally in 
the Tartan Grill or wandering 
around Skibo.
Bill’s history tells us some­
thing of why he is so successful 
in talking to students here. He 
has overcome many obstacles in 
his life, such as ill health, em­
ployment problems, and drug ad­
diction, all of which are problems 
which confront or have con­
fronted many of us. By telling 
students of the means by which 
he has overcome these problems 
he hopes to give them the cour­
age to face their problems rather
effectiveness of communica­
tion, graphic design, psycholo­
gical approach, and illustratin.
than to run from them.
Bill has found the answer to 
his problems in religion. He 
had been a “speed freak” for 
five years when he found re­
lief at the Pittsburgh Revival 
Center in the Northside. But 
Bill preaches neither religion nor 
drugs — pro or con. By simply 
rapping with students he hopes 
to encourage students to con­
tinue doing whatever they have 
started.
In the future, Bill will be hold­
ing an inter-denominational re­
ligious service in the Skibo 
chapel. The meetings will be in­
formal, since Bill opposes organ­
ized religions of all types as 
irrelevant and hypocrytical.
Bill wants to talk to anyone
— regardless of race, religion, or 
national origin. He knows what it 
is like to feel lonely and de­
pressed. He is there for those 
who share these feelings.

Fernando Mariano is a fourth 
year student at Central Min­
danao University, an undevelop­
ed school serving a rural province 
in the Philippines. Fernando is 
studying agriculture so that he 
can become a technical advis­
or to farmers and teach scientific 
methods of crop production. But 
the education he is getting is 
deficient, perhaps inadequate, 
for the university has a great 
handicap.
Central Mindanao University 
lacks textbooks. Fernando and 
his friends complete four years of 
a ‘university’ education, usually 
without ever owning one book. 
Neither the University nor the 
students have the money to buy 
books, and texts must be ordered 
from Manila or the States, a 
time-consuming process. There are 
books in the university library, 
but not many. Most of the tech­
nical books in agriculture, science, 
or mathematics, were published 
thirty years ago. For a course with 
an enrollment of more than a 
hundred students, there will be 
three or four copies of the text 
on reserve in the library. It is im­
possible for that many students 
to use so few textbooks. Since 
many of the books are so out-of- 
date, even if a student is lucky 
enough to find a book to use, he 
is wasting his time learning ob­
solete technical information.
The situation creates another 
disadvantage to the stu­
dents. They become almost com­
pletely dependent upon the in­
structors for information. Teach­
ers who are not necessarily qual­
ified for their positions are grant­
ed a degree of power and con­
trol in the classroom that is sim­
ply unhealthy in modern educa­
tion. Students lack the background 
or the resources to challenge the 
material or ideas presented by the 
instructors.
The members of last summer’s 
YMCA Philippines Project are 
conducting a book driver at 
C-MU to obtain the badly 
needed texts. Tech students who 
have an outdated copy of 
Thomas’ Ca0cr0rl or Samuel- 
son’s Ecgpgkncl that is collect­
ing dust, are asked to donate 
these books to the drive. Any 
book will help; particularly 
needed are math, science, Span­
ish, literature, and economics. 
Paperback novels are also want­
ed. Extracurricular reading can 
help improve English comprehen­
sion for these students who 
speak a dialect but must take 
courses in English.
The books will be sorted and 
sent to Central Mindano Uni­
versity, Dansalan Junior Col­
lege, and Agama Islam Aca­
demy, schools in rural areas of 
the island of Mindanao. These 
students are hungry to read and 
to learn. If you have books that 
you will never use again, bring 
them to the Y Office, Room 57 
in Skibo. For more informa­
tion, contact Tom Huff in the 
Y Office. 621-2600, est. 416.

Clopton and Page Play, 
Record Electric Blues
by TOM DAVIS
A few years ago, nobody 
thought that a young, white 
man could play the Blues. May­
be they thought it was sone ra­
cial deficiency (take that, 
George). However, in 1960, Mick 
Jagger, Bill Wyman, Jimmy Page, 
and Eric Clapton were playing 
really deep, funky, country 
Blues. Everybody knows where 
Jagger and Wyman went, so let’s 
follow Clapton and Page.
Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page 
stayed together for a while, in 
the Yardbirds. After a while, 
Clapton left the yeardbirds and 
joined John Mayall’s Blues- 
breakers. If you get a chance to 
hear an old Bluesbreaker’s record, 
listen for a solitary guitar play­
ing really heavy Blues in the 
background; that’s Clapton. 
They Clapton left John Mayall 
and went with Cream. Cream 
was out of sight, but well with­
in earshot. After Cream, Clapton 
and Cream’s drummer, Ginger 
Baker, went to Stevie Winwood, 
Rich Grech and Blind Faith, 
where they reside today.
Jimmy Page, meanwhile, stay­
ed put with the Yardbirds. He 
stayed with them until about 
TWO YEARS AGO WHEN HE SPL 
FORMED Led Zeppelin. Along witl 
singer Robert Plant, drummer 
John Bonham, and basist-organ- 
ist John Paul Jones, they cut a
very good album “Led Zeppelin.” 
Although a little better known 
than Blind Faith they were not 
recognized as the great Blues 
group that they really are.
Look at the jukebox in Skibo, 
what do you see for Led Zeppel­
in, “Good Times, Bad Times,” and 
“Communications Breakdown.” 
These are good, hard, rock pieces, 
but they don’t give any indica­
tion as to what else is on the al­
bum with them.
Jimmy Page is an excellent 
guitarist, in ,y humble opinion, 
probably as good as Clpton. 
But Jimmy Page has struck to 
Blues whereas Clapton has start­
ed playing pretty, melodic, riffs 
Page’s guitar could easily be B.
B. King or Willy Dixon on “You 
Shook ME” and “I Can’t Quit 
You, Babe.” Jimmy is right 
there, back in 1960 playing hard, 
country Blues. Page has gone 
further and fuzztone to his 
blues. He’s playing Electric 
Blues.”
Jimmy Page and Eric Clap­
ton proved that a white man 
can play the Blues. And be­
lieve it or not, John Lennon has 
struck little Blues riffs into some 
of the cuts on “Abbey Road.” 
Now, Johnny Winter has come 
up playing nothing but hard, 
funky blues.
Is nothing sacred? Thank God 
it isn’t

of virus, and safety Bill Halsted 
has a twisted knee. In addition, 
Tom Lombardo, who did play 
last week against Overlin, is 
still hampered by a hamstring in­
jury. Freshman defensive end John 
Hastings didn’t play at all last 
week and is a very doubtful 
starter this Saturday.
The result of all these injuries 
is that Gasparella again has sev­
eral players going both ways, 
a situation he hoped to avoid.
Last Saturday’s 10-8 loss to Ob- 
erlin was a complete reversal of 
the opening game 46-22 loss to 
Thiel. The Tartans defense play­
ed a strong game against the Yoe- 
men, but the offensive unit fail­
ed to move the ball in critical situ­
ations. A bright spot of the game 
was the outstanding play of 
freshman linebacker John Sabol, 
who receovered a fumble and in­
tercepted two passes.
CMU’s running game was com­
pletely throttled by the Oberlin 
defense, however, and the passing 
game never got started.
Westminster is 1-2 this season, 
a rare situation for the Titans. 
However the losses have come by 
a 14-8 score to Marietta and 34) 
to Susquehanna in games in which 
the Titans seemingly outplayed 
their opponents.
Heading Westminster’s attack 
is quarterback Dave Beirbach, a 
5’11, 180 pound junior from Frank­
lin. Bierbach has gained 230 
yards passing and 103 yards rush­
ing in the three games. The Ti­
tans’ leading rusher is sophomore 
Joe Veres of Sharon, who 
has picked up 245 yards in 46 
carries and has also cought 12 
passes.
Overall in the three contest 
the Titals dominate of the sta­
tistics with 52 first down to the 
opposition’s 32, and 955 yards in 
totaloffense compared to the op­
position’s 502. Defensively the 
New Wilmington team has al­
lowed an average of only 97.6 
yards per game rushing and 69.7 
yards per game passing.
The CMU-Westminster series 
began in 1907 and the Tar­
tans hold a slim 14-13-1 edge. 
However, CMU has won only 
one of the last eight games, that 
one a stunning 41-34 upset in 
1967.

Cal State Tops Harriers
Despite sophomore Jon Manons’ 
third straight first place finish, 
the cross country team fell vic­
tim to a strong California State 
team, 43-20 last Tuesday. Run­
ning together proved to be the 
key to California’s success as 
their first five scorers placed from 
second to sixth. Rounding out 
CMU’s scoring were Steve Haw­
kins (seventh), Pete Hoyson 
(tenth), Joe Lorhan (twelfth), 
and Dennis Sullivan (thirteen­
th).
Team co-captains picked last 
Monday are sophomore Joh Man- 
on and senior Larry Anderson. The 
Team hopes to improve its 2-2 
record when travels to West­
minster this Saturday.
