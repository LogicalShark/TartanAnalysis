False Hopes?
W
HEN' the Pittsburgh newspapers pub­
lished architect's drawings of a proposed 
Memorial Library on the Carnegie campus, 
practically everyone was taken by surprise-—
• liiifc with that surprise arose the hope that per- 
: iape, finally one of the most crying needs on 
tHo campus would be fulfilled.
;! i-Nbw.-as more light Is thrown on the subject, 
’.With:each emerging fact the liope that such a 
btiilding will ¿ver become an actuality grows a
- shade dimmer. 
r:. ,>The petition was unofficial.
"• The Board ofTruatees knew nothing about it.
> The matter is too embryonic to be given 
con,0jfderation as yet. -r
Wljat small hope does remain Is this: Now 
,-thacithe project has been suggested — and It 
¦•seems- on the surface entirely feasible—it is 
. .not too late for the Bonrd of Trustees to give 
It .full consideration. Even if the original re* 
ports were unofficial, let’s not drop the idea 
v.yet. There may'be something in it.

be rlgbtfully considered ment ..or the community—and not merely In a.figurative sense. Since teachers are supported in large part iy '.public taxes, although not rtfways directly, they can be regard­ed as a real investment to be .used to the best possible advantage. Society ' provides the means of training , for teachers, and society must'eapect-some.return for this provision.
-Use For Common GoodJust as society seeks to preserve and utilize natural resources 'best .possible, way, so it mui.__elder the specialized training of teachers, as a esource to be used for the common good.
If this is true, then intelligent public opinion must insist on aca­demic freedom—not for the sake of the faculty alone, nor the sake of. the students, the sake of society as a whole. No one.cun depy .tbe fact that teachers play eri essential part In modern life, that their knowledge and train­ing are of somu value. Thei no reason, then, why the public should not expect to have the right to derive the full-benefit of what­ever specialized knowledge teach­ers may have gained. There should be no necessity for telling Universi­ties not to intsrfere with state- mente ot faculty members’, no mat­ter what thclr implications.
One may say further that it is not enough merely to desire-that Universities cease to restrain pro­fessors, but that it Is the dutyofthu faculty to demand immunity from censure much in the same way that members of Congress possess im­munity.. There is a definite need for a body of men who are free to tell the truth,latteiof :This, does not mean, of course, that teachers on .the whole,Individuals, are' extraordinarily wise or saintly.

and amused a packed house'last'Friday - . . Chairman Pendle­

for the advancement of Peace . . just to be on the safe side 
Official Bouncers Hudson, Croft, Splsak, etc., were stationed at 
points of vantage throughout the room .. but they failed to 
reprimand Voskamp, Kuhn, Lyne, and others who'heckled Dr. 
Clausen with a steady undertone in the back of the hall „ . . 
those who came in the hop^s of excitment were partially satis­
fied by Soldler-of-Fortune Ackley’s charge that both sides of the 
question had not been presented . . . wily little Phil Morrison, 
who played slooge throughout thei entire meeting with his mc^ 
tions to do this and that (as rehearsed), suggested that Mr.! 
Ackley lighten the audience with his views on preparedness .... 
but the man who pounds the drum with such abandon was not to 
be scared down, and amid the flashings of the many photograph-' 
eti, Kampus -King marched up to the pulpit, for the sake of the. 
Army . . . truest remark was the confession that one of. the
- purposes of the R. O: T. C; Is to instruct the Army men so that 
in case of war they can teach the men who do the actual fighting 
. . . moral; you. might gather that R. O. T. C. training is the 
best way to guarantee that you'll die in bed . . . maybe the 
Army boys are the wise ones after all.
THE CLUBS ARE SHAKING the hoof again ... the Betas had 
a Formal Douce Friday at Longview . . , very nice affair with 
everyone much happier while away from that restraining influ- 
tence of house rules . . . a. lot of the boys.got off to a swell 
start in the afternoon . . . better not mention any names ... 
Saturday was a bJg.day.for tbe.Delts with formal initiation, ban­
quet, and a!’ Formal Dan'ce in the evenidg ... somebody bribed 
the orchestra at Gammon’s !Pub to -play a Delt song when they
- entered after the 'dance .' -'. that dancing of “Hot-Foot” Schleu- 
sener and Dolly Volkwein is fast becoming the talk of the towri 
... . so entertaining that-the management'asked him to. return
gratis.
CONGRATULATIONS to Owen Bowser . . . and a question: 
what did he feed the dorm men to make them turn out en masse 
with their votes? . . . and to Interfraternity. Council; what 
hypnotic qualities of the dorm men persuaded fourteen fraternity 
men to overrule tradition by electing the Intramural Mushball 
Manager from the dorms?
BECAUSE of-Jim "Ladies’ Man” Heatley’s novel method of intro­
ducing his friends Lee Hammerschmldt has changed his name to

IF YOU NOTICE some new athletic sweaters around the campus, 
it’s partly due to Kissel’s gumshoeing around the. A. A.- Offlce-

WE WONDER about the value of education when Informed that 
the short story course over at MMCC didn’t produce anything

jjfCLEMENT WEATHER LEAVES SUNDAY'S SCRIBES ratlier at a 
[or material. Saturday’s big scrimmage was postponed, as was 
track meet wilb the local Kay club, the latter quite indefinitely. 
Thursday saw the gridders In scrimmage, however, with emphasis 
lie liming and execution of a variety of plays. Little system was 
apparent, and frosh, sophs, etc., were all put In together and tried out 
different positions. Brittle Anderson sprained his ankle,
NEITHER THE MUSHBALL FIELD NOR THE TRACK are conditioned 
as yet. Mr. Rlsedorph hoped to get the ball field Into shape over the 
•ek-end, but this activity, he had to postpone until this week, and it 
probable that the conditioning of the field will not be complete until 
e end of Easter vacation.,. This will necessitate postponement .of 
e mushball-games scheduled for the first of this week until the latter 
part of next week.
DINGER HAS FOUND SUBSTITUTES for track managing In the Tar- 
ige artists. It is difficult to conceive of the basketball candi- 
earnestly raking stones from the cinder path, but that is what 
Ibey bave been doing. They receive a certain amount of recreational 
mess every time the star sophomore looper, -Andy Kriiscber, drives 
tirn-ith the tractor—he almost always gets a load of passengers for-a 
jauoL down the field.
[an AMOUNT: OF DISCUSSION IN INTERFRATERNITY council 
neeting has been dovoted to' the possibility of additional sports com­
petition In the Intramuçal field. Tennis, ping-pong, track and touch 
Lball have been suggested. Tennis will be rather Impossible In 
epring because the courts will be kept pretty busy by the frosh and 
sity candidates. Incidentally, H. C. Bourns, who played' tennis for 
Carnegie In 1924 and for Pitt In ’26 and '27, later a pro, has been added 
the Carnegte athletic staff as conch of the freshman tennl6 team. 
Getting back to the Intramural sports activities, I' recall the efforts 
three yeara.^ago which attempted' to execute track, competition be* 
een the fraternities. The final meet was a wow, but there were so 
iv organizations which could boast of enough talent to produce a 
am which could exèbiike thé various tra'ck and field events that the 
;a waa abandoned for'future years. I believe this same argument still 
Ids true. As for touch football, the mushball field and bowl will be 
pretty active for thé rest of this year. But for next year the proposl- 
ion is capital—and I'know of no organization-which would not enjoy 
i snappy touch tournament.
Ping-pong has (numerable supporters In all fraternities arid dorml- 
ories, and from the number of Old Golds being consumed by several 
F the organizations, there's many an eye out for the prize ping-pong 
table which Is being competed .for'In this novel manner. The- Dftlt

Speed Trials Tonight; 
Practice Continues
The meet which was to have 
been held between the Tavtan var­
sity aod the Kay Club last Satur­
day, was called off, due to had 
weather. The; unexpected spring 
ralus and suow made It impossible 
to carry the meet out as scheduled. 
This meet was to have been only a- 
practice meet, so that the regular 
Intercollegiate competition has not benn affccted.
The second practice meet on the 
schedule comes nest Saturday, against the P. A. A. For several years, the Plaid outfit has met the representatives of the P. A. A. prior to the regular collegiate com­petition. The meet this year comes during the Easter vacation, but due to the fact that the majority of the fellows on the team live In Pittsburgh and the immediate vi* cinty, the strength of the team will not be. noticeably weakened by the absences due 't'o" the va'Catlon.
Tills afternoon, speed trials will be. held for all candidates for the varsity berths. So far this season,
lublieb just who will participate for the glory of Carnegie during the coming meets.

The loss of varsity players last year was not too great, and with the addition of several àble sopho­mores there should not be any tlceable weakness. Among tjie most notable of the new racquet- eers is Art Hughes, a. brilliant tit­tle player from Long Island. The Freshmen are under the new Frestiman coach, H. C. Bourns, who played with Tech in 1924 and Pitt in 1926 and 1927. Bourns has played professional tènnis for the past few years and has taught tils at-various clubs In the eastern part of the country.
The tennis schedule follows:

William Kulesz i.!35'- has-.recently 
been awarded, the Golden Glove by the Carnegie Athletic 'counell. This award Is only given to intercollegi­ate boxing -champions. Kulesz al­so received the gold- • Conference medal when he won: bis final lu (he Intercollegiate Conference at West Virginia several weeks- ago.
Kulesz has lost only two bouts iu his entire boxing career. He bag fought it) about ten collegiate and four amateur matches. He started boxing under Coach Ernie Sesto when he was a sophomore at Carnegie, but after, his first fight. In that year he was declared in­eligible. That first fight was with a Duquesne contestant; he won it easily, and his being declared In­eligible was quite a' blow to ths Carnegie team. This year was Kulesz’ first lull season in the ring, and he was undefeated throughout. Allthe contestants he met this year were also undefeat- od, except for the losses to KuleB*.
-Coach Eddie Vacheress, of West Virginia, stated that' the' Tartan mlttmnn was not only the most out­standing boxer In the tournament and. for that matter. In the whole confercnce, but the cleverest fight­er he ban ever seen fn his asso­ciation with. West Virginia inter­collegiate boxing activities.
Another outstanding Tavtan box­er is Bill Beal, who is .declared to be the brightest prospect for the rext season. Beal, besides being e iop-notch fighter is listed on tbe Carnegie honor roll with a 3.93 av­erage. It 16 possible that Bill Beal will receive a scholarship for his excellent work at Carnegie.

Activities
Records ebow that tbe scholastic standing ot students engaged hi ac­tivities is above tho average for the student body as a whole. It is Interesting to note the opinion of one of the leading Eastern col­leges with regard to students en­gaged In extra-curricular activities.
, A Cow years ago, a processor at M. I. T. advised his students that tbe college course offered much more to the students who took part in activities than to those who did not. "Tho student who spent most ¦ at his time with boohs/' he said, .“misted the most essential part of education, that of making friend­ships fjuch as can be gained only by taking part, in activities.”
Those who took no part in any activity but spent all of their time with books in an effort to attain high/scholastic rankings were tera- . ed- “brown baggers” a term applied to those who do nothing but study.
The wisdom of the professor's words has been proven by a recent survey of academic records. The study shows .timt students who take part in social functions, col­lege publications and other phases of activties are averaging consid­erably higher than jhe general scholastic level. of the student 
body.
' Notably on the list of activity groups having definite superior - ranldnffe is the management of the Tech Engineering News. Other or­ganizations and groups which at­tained enviable records were those . ii£';chiarge of “The . Benchmark,’? an- n^al publication of the civil engi­neering summer damp; the ofSlcerB ojC. the combjned professional so- cities, the institute committee and .'Hie dormitory committee,' which has charge of' student government.

Night Student Council
Class Dues As a Means 
Foi Semuiing Funds
Class dues or assessments were another means used by the night group to raise funds with which to conduct the social functions of tbe individual colleges.
The class dues were an additional assessment over tbe activities fee and no student was considered by iiis classmates’to be In good stand­ing with the group until this fee had been paid. ^
The collection of the dues was sot very satisfactory on the whole although one college, 'Flue' Arts,

port given -by the nigbt Arts stu­dents in tbe payment of tbe class dues this college was able to liold parties frequently. They were not wholly dependent upon tbe activity fee, and were usually able to close the school year with a balance in their treasury.The officers of tbe Engineering college were less successful in their efforts as it was difficult to per- tuade the students to support them. The method used* to collect the I dues was to hold a meeting at the beginning of the school year and station men at tbe door, at the con­clusion of the meeting, whose duty is to solicit the fund. It- was | not a very unsatisfactory system, which left them short of funds and consequently their major function (he (Engineering banquet was de­pendent upon the pro rata' nhare of the general activity fee and other sources. . The consequence was that the banquet suffered through lack of funds and balances were carried over to other years.In the College of Industries the least success of all was encounter- id In collecting any class dues and the practice became oVsolete. This college made no unified demands on Any of the general activity fee collected but functions held by de­partmental groups drew, on the fees ' time to time although, always leaving a balanace due the/college as a whole. • It was very difficult, to bring the night industries .‘men to­gether for any kind of a‘ major af­fair, as the registration was usually large, ‘so-tbe, Interest In this college centered arouiid the various departmental groups.
