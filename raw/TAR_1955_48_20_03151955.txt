Buddy Overend, dean of Tech athletic directors, was claimed by 
death last Thursday, March 10. He was in charge of the athletic 
program during: the “golden age” of sports at Tech, and he built up 
friendly relationships with universities and colleges all over the coun­
try for Carnegie Tech.
Buddy Overend, Former 
Athletic Director, Dies
Carnegie Tech lost one of its most avid supporters and a man who 
devoted most of his life to the Carnegie Tech athletic program when 
death claimed Clarence (Buddy) Overend last Thursday, March 10.
Until his retirement in 1952 he was athletic director and served in 
~ *this capacity for 47 years. Prob­
ably no other person has done as 
much to make the name of Car-
Dr. Freehof will be the second 
speaker in the current series of 
religious assemblies which have 
been arranged by the newly- 
formed Committee on Religious 
Activities. The assembly program 
is intended to take the place of 
ithe former bi-weekly Tuesday 
chapels. It is hoped that through 
these assembly programs ClT will
Rabbi S. B. Freehof
Assembly Speaker
have an opportunity to hear pres­
entations of religious concerns by 
outstanding laymen and clergy of 
all faiths.
Dr. Freehof was born in London 
and came to the United States 
with his parents at the age of 
eleven. He is a graduate of the 
University of Cincinnati and the 
Hebrew Union College. During the 
first World War he was a chaplain 
in the American Expeditionary 
Force. For nine years he was a 
member of the faculty x»f the 
Hebrew Union College and was 
Rabbi of the Kehillath Anshe 
Marriv Temple in Chicago previ­
ous to coming to Pittsburgh in 
1934 as Rabbi of the Rodef Shalom 
Temple.
Author and Reviewer
A member of the Central Con­
ference of American Rabbis, he 
has served as president of that 
organization and is also a member 
of the Executive Board of the 
Union of American Hebrew Con­
gregations. In addition to being a 
well known book reviewer, Dr. 
Freehof is the author of “Stormers 
of Heaven,” “Modern Jewish 
Preaching,” “Preface to Scrip­
ture,” “Commentary of the Book 
of Psalms,” and “In the House of 
the Lord.”
Dr. Freehof made an extensive 
tour of Israel two years ago as the 
gift of his congregation to him. His 
series of articles concerning the 
tour which appeared in a Pitts­
burgh paper, and his lectures upon 
his return have won him nation­
wide recognition as a scholar and 
speaker.
Sponsored by Y's
The Tech YMCA and YWCA 
are inviting Dr. Freehof to have 
lunch in the Blue Room at More- 
wood Gardens following the as­
sembly program. Students and 
faculty ,are invited to attend this 
luncheon, also, to take the oppor­
tunity for questions and discussion 
with Dr. Freehof.

Debating Team 
Attends Tourney 
Held At Allegheny
A team of four debaters—Jack 
Belkin, Simon Kellman, Allan 
Zuckerwar, and June Sochatoff— 
represented the CIT Debating 
Society at the Eighth Annual 
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate For­
ensic Tournament held at Alle­
gheny College on March 4 and 5.
There were five preliminary 
rounds of debate on the current 
question, “Resolved that the 
United States should recognize 
the Communist government of 
China.” Pitt, Westminster, St. 
Joseph’s, and Penn State met in 
the semi-final round with Pitt 
and Penn State emerging the vic­
tors. These two teams then met 
in the final round with Pitt final­
ly winning the tournament.
Pitt gained permanent posses­
sion of the trophy by winning it 
for the third time. Until one 
school has won it three times, the 
trophy is given to the winning 
school for one year and relinquish­
ed at the beginning of thjp next 
year’s tournament. Pitt had pre­
viously won the trophy in 1949 
and in 1953, when they beat Tech 
by one point in the final round.
This year the Tech team won 
8 rounds and lost 4. Three of the 
four losses were to teams who 
went into the semi finals.

Hillel To Sponsor 
Model Passover 
Sunday9 April 3
In a few weeks, the Passover 
holidays will be here and the 
B’nai B’rith Hillel Foundation of 
Tech thought it would be a treat, 
especially for the students living 
away from home, to have a model 
Passover dinner.
A traditional Passover program 
will accompany the full course 
meal. As part of the program there 
will be singing of both modern 
and traditional Jewish songs; 
there will also be an enactment 
of a radio script entitled, “War­
saw Ghettp.” And three of our 
talented Hillel members—Helene 
Shifrin, Marcie Goldstein, Sylvia 
Dante—will aid in presenting the 
program.
The dinner will be held on 
Sunday evening, April 3, 1955 at 
6:00 p.m. at the Beta Sigma Rho 
fraternity house and there will 
be a charge of $1.50. Because of 
the planning required, tickets 
must be purchased in advance. All 
tickets must be bought before 
March 27, 1955 and can be got­
ten from any of the Hillel 
ticket representatives. The fol­
lowing are the ticket representa­
tives: Harvey Breverman, Jim
Edelson , Don Gurwitz, Rachel 
Katzin, Debby Robyn, Pearl Ry- 
ave and Manny Slawkin.
Every year the drama depart­
ment has given a Shakespearian

Cadets To Observe 
Ordnance Team 
At Reserve Center
Plans have been undertaken for 
Carnegie ROTC cadets to attend a 
two-hour program to be given by 
the Second Army Ordnance Mobile 
Instructional and Demonstration 
Team. The team will visit the 
reserve centSr on March 22.
The first hour of the program 
will be devoted to the role of ord­
nance in the technical assistance 
program. Descriptions of army 
vehicles in use and being devel­
oped will cover a large part of the 
hour.
Army weapons, from light 
weight rifle to atomic cannon and 
guided -missies, will be described 
during the second hour, along with 
Are control sets and ordnance field 
fire control systems.
Also on the program will be a 
discussion of Army Ordnance ac­
tivities and Nike, the new guided 
missle defense weapon.
Army Ordnance is a field that i 
affects all other branches of the 
service and a better understand­
ing of it will, the military depart­
ment feels, be of special interest to 
Corp of Engineer and Signal 
Corp cadets. AH cadets planning 
to attend should notify Mr. Wib- 
ner, Military Department by March 
18.
negie Tech respected in the field 
of sports.
During his tenure he saw Car­
negie Tech football teams develop 
into national contenders. He was 
also in charge of deemphasizing 
the sport1 and returning Tech io 
its present athletic policy.
Entered Tech
Buddy Overend first came to 
Tech in 1905 as a student with the 
first class to enter the institution. 
He served as vice-president of his 
class and organized and captained 
the first varsity athletic team. This 
was a hockey team that played 
Yale in that year. During his 
undergraduate days he also be­
came a charter member of Alpha 
Tau Omega.
Appointed athletic director in 
1907 he was responsible for de­
veloping friendly athletic relation­
ships with universities and col­
leges all over the country. In this 
capacity he developed many per­
sonal friends and helped pubilizie 
Tech. He also served as chairman 
of the Athletic Board from 1920 
and 1923. Later in his career at 
Tech he also served as golf coach.
Golf Position
Upon his retirement in 1952 
Buddy Overend became secretary- 
treasurer of the Western Pennsyl­
vania Golf Association, which 
position he held until his death.

3-2 Plan Fills Demand 
For Liberal Engineers
In the last decade the duties of engineers have grown complex. 
Interwoven in the fabric of engineering duties today are huge ad­
ministrative and managerial chores. The engineer must be a well- 
rounded man to function adequately. He must understand social,
Page 2—CARNEGIE TARTAN—Tuesday, March 15, 1955
political and economic implica- ^ 
tions of his scientific and engi­
neering activities. This fact has 
become a major problem to engi­
neering educators.
One answer to the problem is 
the 3-2 plan at Carnegie Tech. 
The plan allows the student a 
broad liberal arts foundation be­
fore he undertakes a technical 
program. It also gives the unde­
cided student some college ex­
perience which helps him choose 
whether he really wants to study 
engineering or science, and it 
provides students a second chance 
if their high school performance 
was not high enough to gain en­
trance into the freshman class at 
Tech.
A three-years liberal arts pro­
gram is agreed upon between 
Carnegie Tech and the participat­
ing school. If the student com­
pletes the program with a grade 
of “B” or better, the liberal arts 
school recommends him for ad­
mission. He enters as a junior. 
After two years of intensified 
engineering education, he receives 
both a B.A. from the liberal arts 
college and a B.S. from Tech.
Acceptance Guaranteed
The program provides a plan­
ned sequence of courses which 
guarantees acceptance at Car­
negie Tech if completed with a 
“B” average. This opportunity 
might be denied a student of 
equivalent standing not partici­
pating in the plan.
“The plan has several advan­
tages to both participating insti­
tutions,” according to Dr. Doug­
las F. Miller, Director of Student 
Personnel and Welfare at Car­
negie Tech. “The liberal arts col­
lege attracts students who have 
an interest in engineering or sci­
ence and desire to attend a lib­
eral arts college for at least three 
years. Carnegie Tech obtains 
transfer students who have dem­
onstrated their competence and 
who serve to fill the gaps in the 
upper classes caused by attrition 
in the lower classes.’”
Growth Since 1938
The program was started at 
Carnegie Tech in 1938 when eight ! 
district colleges agreed to a pre­
engineering science program ac­
ceptable to the engineering school. 
These first participating schools 
were Westminster, Geneva, Wash­
ington and Jefferson, Denison, Al­
bion, Baldwin-Wallace, Allegheny I 
and Hiram.
Since then, Bethany, Capital ; 
University, Colby, De Pauw Uni­
versity, Franklin and Marshall, j 
Iowa Wesleyan, Juniata, K£nyon, 
Ohio Wesleyan University, Otter- 
bein, Thiel, Washington and Lee 
University, and Williamette Uni­
versity have joined Carnegie | 
Tech’s 3-2 plan.
This year, the University of 
Kansas City became the twenty- I 
second liberal arts college in the 
program.
The 3-2 transfer students are 
highly successful at the engineer­
ing school. Over the last eight 
years, 155 transfers entered into 
civil, electrical, mechanical, chem­
ical, or metallurgical engineering j 
curriculum and the industrial 
management curriculum. Rarely j 
have any failed to graduate.
Math
Professor Edwin G. Olds of 
Tech’s mathematics depart­
ment will speak on “The Na­
ture of the Standard Control 
Chart, and Some of Its Com­
petitors'* at the ninth annual 
convention of the American 
Society for Quality Control, 
May 23-25, at the Hotels Stat- 
ler and New Yorker in New 
York City.
International
The International Club will 
have its next meeting: on
Thursday, March 17 at 8:00 
p.m. in the Carnegie Union.
Major John T. Dabinett, 
professor in the CIT military 
department, will talk on “An 
American Views Europe.” He 
has had six years experience 
in various European countries. 
Major J. T. Dabinett not only 
saw war time Europe, but he 
also witnessed first hand many 
of the progressing: changes
there in recent years.
The speech will be followed 
by a social hour. Refresh­
ments will be served. All in­
terested persons are welcome!
P&D Students 
Hold Affair
On Friday night, March 11, the 
painting and design department 
held a Doomsday party. This 
party was in place of the one held 
annually by the Beaux Arts so­
ciety.
Everyone in the Fine Arts was 
invited, and various strange cos­
tumes could be seen. Those go­
ing to the party were dressed 
“as what they have always want- 
er to be, and may never be if 
tomorrow is doomsday.”
Entertainment for the evening 
was provided by a jazz combo 
from Pittsburgh. During inter­
mission, Marshall Pihl and John 
Kestner supplied the humor for 
the evening, while Gwen Sheffey 
supplied the singing.
No Plaid
There will be no PLAID 
next week because of the 
forthcoming: mid-semester ex­
ams. The next issue will be

Broadivay Drama 
To Open Thursday 
At The Playhouse
On Thursday evening, the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse will present the 
first Pittsburgh showing of- the 
Broadway drama, “The Crucible,” 
which will open a three week run 
in the Craft Avenue theater.
This is the first play by Arthur 
Miller to follow the extraordinary 
success of his “Death of a Sales­
man” which won him the Pulitzer 
Prize and the position of out­
standing American playwright of 
our time.
“The Crucible” is a story re­
lating the momentous events that 
left a scar on American history— 
the witchcraft trials 4n Salem, 
Massachusetts in 1692.
George Peppard will have the 
leading role of the colonial farm­
er, John Proctor, whose stubborn 
demand for justice during the 
mass hysteria of the witch-hunts 
aroused the hostility of the bigoted 
persecutors. Patti Littell will play 
the role of Elizabeth Proctor, his
wife, who is unjustly accused of 
witchcraft.
Harry Lantz will play the im­
portant role of the deputy-gover- 
nor who presides at the trials, and 
other top perfor.ners include 
Richard Walsh, John Eames, 
Barbara Massar, and Virginia Alt. 
Also in the cast are Herb Young, 
Alma Lind, Helen Simyak, Allan 
Pinsker, Leon Ward, Lynn Hodg- 
kiss, Francine Hunter, Mariana 
Boes, Ellsworth Gearlinger, Shir­
ley Buttitta, Howard Pace, Syl 
Schaefer, and Martha Ross.
“The Crucible” is being di­
rected by Frederick Burleigh with 
settings by Chandler Potter. The 
Arthur Miller play will open at 
the Playhouse this Thursday and 
run through April 2.

SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 2
Though this column is intended solely as a vehicle for well- 
tempered drollery, the makers of Philip Morris have agreed to 
let me use this space from time to time for a short lesson in 
science. They are the most decent and obliging of men, the 
makers of Philip Morris, as one would guess from sampling 
their product. Only from bounteous hearts could come such a 
pleasurable cigarette—so felicitously blended, so gratifying to 
the taste, so soothing to the psyche. And, as though bringing 
you the most agreeable cigarette on the market were not enough, 
the makers of Philip Morris have enclosed their wares in the 
Snap-Open Pack, an ingeniously contrived wrapping that yields 
up its treasure without loss of time or cuticle. And, finally, 
this paragon of cigarettes, wrapped in the paragon of packages, 
can be had in king-size or regular, as your taste dictates. Who 
can resist such a winning combination? Not I.
A few weeks ago in this column we had a brief lesson in chem­
istry. Today we take up another attractive science—medicine.
Medicine was invented in 1066 by a Greek named Hippocrates. 
He soon a4 tracted around him a group of devoted disciples whom 
he called “doctors”. The reason he called them “doctors” was 
that they sat around a dock all day. Some fished, some just 
dozed in the noonday sun. In truth, there was little else for them 
to do, because disease was not invented until 1492.
After that doctors became very busy, but, it must be reported, 
their knowledge of medicine was lamentably meagre. They 
knew only one treatment—a change of climate. For example, a 
French doctor would send all his patients to Switzerland; a 
Swiss doctor, on the other hand, would send all his patients to 
France. By 1789 the entire population of France was living in 
Switzerland, and vice versa. This later became known as the 
Black Tom Explosion.
Not until 1924 did medicine, as we know it, come into being. 
In that year in the little Bavarian village of Pago-Pago an 
elderly physician named Winko Sigafoos discovered the hot 
water bottle. He was, of course, burned as a witch, but his son 
Lydia, disguised as a linotype, smuggled the hot water bottle 
out of the country. He called on Florence Nightingale in London 
but was told by her housekeeper, with some asperity, that Miss 
Nightingale had died in 1910. Lydia muttered something and, 
disguised as a feather boa, made his way to America, where he 
invented the blood stream.
Medicine, as it is taught at your very own college, can be divided 
roughly into two classifications. There is internal medicine, 
which is the treatment of internes, and external medicine, which 
is the treatment of extemes.
Diseases also fall into two broad categories—chronic and 
acute. Chronic disease, is of course, inflammation of the chron, 
which can be mighty painful, believe you me! Last summer my 
cousin Haskell was stricken with a chron attack while out pick­
ing up tinfoil, and it was months before the wretched boy could 
straighten up. In fact, even after he was cured, Haskell con­
tinued to walk around bent over double. This went on for some 
weeks before Dr. Caligari, the lovable old country practitioner 
who treats Haskell, discovered that Haskell had his pants but­
toned to his vest.
Two years ago Haskell had Addison’s disease. (Addison, 
curiously enough, had Haskell’s.) Poor Haskell catches every­
thing that comes along. Lovable old Dr. Caligari once said to 
him, “Son, I guess you are what they call a natural born catcher.”
“The joke is on you, Doc,” replied Haskell. “I am a third 
baseman.” He thereupon fell into such a fit of giggling that the 
doctor had to put him under sedation, where he is to this day.
But I digress. We were discussing medicine. I have now told 
you all I can; the rest is up to you. Go over to your medical 
school and poke around. Bring popcorn and watch an operation. 
Fiddle with the X-ray machines. Contribute to the bone bank 
... And, remember, medicine can be fun!* ©M»i Shulm»n, 195»
The makers of PHILIP MORRIS, *cho bring you this column, have 
nursed their flavorfni tobaccos to bring you the most pleasurable 
smoke obtainable.
Reviewer Finds 
New Scotter Issue 
Above Average
The New Scotter magazine, with 
an Emmet-like cover, appeared on 
the stands last Wednesday after 
much publicity. A clever take-off 
on the New Yorker magazine, this 
issue of the Scot keeps fairly close 
in layout and type (if not quality) 
of humor to the original, and is on 
a higher plane than the usual issue 
of Tech’s humor magazine.
Much talked .about over Skibo 
coffee were some of Bill Aiken’s 
jokes, especially the one about 
Green Stamps, and the Comings 
Off About Town page which is a 
fairly good parody of the original 
Goings On About Town, Night 
Life, and Theater have some of 
the better bits in the column.
The articles also are an improve­
ment over the usual in that they 
make a sincere effort to have the 
New Yorker flavor. However, in 
some cases there may have been 
too sincere an effort to imitate 
New Yorker humor, for the shaggy 
dog seems rather shorn in one or 
two articles. And despite the New 
Yorker flavor there is a taste of 
the Tech Scot. Whether this is 
good or not we hesitate to say. 
Perhaps if Scot writers omitted a 
little more corn and included a 
little more real wit, we could be 
more complimentary.
As it is, the general consensus of 
opinion rates the current issue of 
the Scot above other issues, in­
cluding previous attempts at paro­
dying popular magazines, the New 
Yorker included. And because of 
the good reception the Scotter got 
for its better articles, humor, and 
advertising, the staff will probably 
have more issues like it. If what 
they say about experience is true, 
this may mean better and better 
issues of the Scot.

Editorial-
ResponsibilityREPRESENTATIVES
During the past several weeks we have 
heard comments concerning what the rela­
tionship between student activities and the 
administration should be. In other,words 
just how far should the administration go in 
restricting individuals and groups on campus 
and still be justified in its action? The solu­
tion to this problem lies in an interpretation 
of the relationships that exist between the 
student body and the administration.
It would- be entirely possible for the ad­
ministration to take a hands off policy with 
regards to student activities if it was not for 
the fact that the student activities carry the 
name of the school and their actions reflect 
on the school community. Just as in any 
other society there must be a limit on in­
dividual liberty when the welfare of the 
group is concerned.
The college group can be considered a 
small society made up of faculty, students, 
and administration. The success of this- so­
ciety depends upon its relationships with 
other societies, such as the city, state, and 
nation. Friction often develops between the 
school and the other groups on how higher 
education can best be obtained. The admin­
istration must be concerned with the long- 
range effects of school policies as well as the 
short-run aspects of any student action.
Everyone in the school society is responsible for the 
health and reputation of the school. This calls for responsible 
action. The continued health and well being of the school 
depends upon the support of alumni, parents of prespective 
students, and its name and reputation in the outside com­
munity. If this support is not forthcoming the college would 
son be forced to close its doors.
In view of these conditions it seems that an entering 
student must be ready to accept a contract with the school. 
He must be willing to give up some of his personal freedoms 
for the good of the college. When attending college our every 
action reflects upon the reputation and standing of the col­
lege in the eyes of the community. It seems logical therefore, 
that the group must have some method of protecting itself 
from irresponsible individual action which threatens the 
welfare of the group.
Many students claim that restricted actions and activi­
ties are detrimental since the student should be allowed to 
choose for himself what is right or wrong.
It is not a question of effect on the student or the quali­
ty of student judgment. Rather, it is a question of follow­
ing a policy calculated to promote the present and future 
health of the school community.

Council Again
With Student Council elections again approaching we 
can not help but wonder “Why a Student Council?” Several 
years ago the cry was that Student Council was not doing 
all that it could to further the students best interests. Now 
it seems more appropriate to wonder if Council is doing 
anything.
While covering meetings of Student Council we have 
found that interest of most Council Members is mostly non­
existent. While this body appropriates more than $40,000 to

various student activities, its interests seem 
to stop there.
Attendance of Council members has been 
so poor in the past that many times official 
business has been postponed because of the 
lack of a quorum. The recent move of Stu­
dent Council to lower the percentage of mem­
bers needed to constitute a quorum bears this 
point out. Business has been so slack lately 
that meetings are now held every two weeks 
instead of the once a week schedule.
One suggestion that has been made is 
that the size of Council be reduced. The 
present representation from the students 
presents an unwieldy group, and one which 
is very difficult to get together for regular 
meetings. While membership on Council is 
an honor and confers certain prestige upon 
individuals and whatever organization they 
may represent, the primary purpose of any 
student government organization is to ad­
vance general student welfare.

I’m not exactly a writer, you see. I’m what you 
might call, a “copy-writer.” Every time I hear a 
good story. I copy it. But, in writing you have 
to be original. There’s no way out. Musicians can 
claim they have only tones to share among them­
selves, M.E.’s can claim a few forces. While 
chemists are automatically original—PV never 
equals NRT. As for me, I have a whole book full 
of words—and I can’t hardly write them right no 
more. No how. What a funny bird the frogie age; 
he ain’t got no tail, almost hardly. When he run, 
he jump; when he jump, he sit . . . where he ain’t 
got no tail, almost hardly. PV still doesn’t equal 
NRT.
It’s confusing like when you call a perfectly good 
telephone number and the operator interrupts to 
ask what the number is. You tell her, and she says: 
“That is a correct number, please dial it again, 
Sir.” It’s particularly rough if you’re calling D- 
Tower, and the line finds itself busy for the next 
half-hour. Which, oddly enough, brings us to Etaoin 
Shrdlu’s philosophy that “Marriage pays the high­
est wages for unskilled labor.”

44Adults Only”
Editor, the Tartan:
It would seem that the Scotch ’n Soda club is 
doing an excellent job at publicity for their forth­
coming production, “Adults Only.” From all indi­
cations the show will be one of the best in years. 
The Scotch ’n Soda Club is about the only group 
on the campus that does put on any type of con-
The program schedule of WRCT, Radio Carnegie 
Tech, has undergone some interesting changes for 
the coming week. Several new program have been 
added to the schedule and other programs will 
feature special attractions.
On Saturday from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. a new 
program, “Matinee”, will be heard. This show will 
feature music not usually heard on the regular 
popular or *classical music shows. Another program 
change that has taken place is on Wednesday 
evening at 7:00 p.m. “Encore” will replace the 
present show called “Guest Artist” and will con­
tinue until 8:00 p.m.
Several added attractions appear on this weeks 
schedule. Recordings made at the recent Kiltie 
Band concert will be heard tonight at 8:00 p.m. 
The complete concert will be played as performed 
by the band in the Carnegie Music Hall. On Wed­
nesday the score of the recent Greek Sing contest 
will be broadcast at 8:00 p.m. This is a chance to 
see if you agreed with the judges.

centrated publicity program.
But in one respect the publicity campaign has 
gone too far. The oversized rubber stamp that has 
marked the campus up with “Adults Only” on 
everything is a little too much. I have observed 
the sign on buildings, woodwork, posters, and fur­
niture. The idea of destroying property and other 
people’s posters is not consistent with the aim of 
the advertising campaign since it does not build 
good will.

The Scot
Editor, the Tartan:
The new issue of The Scot came out last week 
and again it hit the campus like a lead balloon. Al­
though admittedly this issue was better than most 
(see story on page 3), the whole magazine serves 
to little more than point out the low level to which 
our “humor magazine” has slipped! *
But to get to the main point I want to make, in 
this issue the Scot did a very distasteful one-page 
article degrading the Tartan. The caliber of the 
article was not much above that of a quarter trash 
novel. Nasty and filthy insinuations were made 
which should never be allowed in print in such 
a magazine. I am sorry to see that the Scot was so 
short on material that they had to stoop to print­
ing an article such as this which degrades a sister 
campus publication. May it never happen again!
Sincerely 
R. F.
Editor's note: We agree! However, we plead 
guilty to a similar offense as you will find by look• 
ing back at an October issue of the TARTAN.

Prepare For Season
With hardly more than a chance to catch their breath, Tech stu­
dents will be subjected to the ever increasing parade of sports. Spring 
will soon be here and with it will come track, tennis, golf, and foot­
ball practice. ? ---------------------------------
The track and tennis teams have 
been working out for the past 
couple of weeks with large turn­
outs for both sports. The track 
team lost no one through gradua­
tion from last year’s squad, and 
should improve on last year’s rec­
ord, if this is possible. The 1954 
squad went undefeated in all its 
dual meets but came in second in 
Tri-State, extending its win skein 
to 27, which covers a four-year 
span.
Track Team
Returning from last year’s squad 
will be Mai Gillies, John Muller, 
Ward Jones, Bill Fetter, Jim 
Flynn, Dick Smith, Dick Stoffan, 
Percy Chuck, Joe Szwec, Frank 
McCurdy, Mike Driscoll, Bill Swa- 
ney, and A1 Zuckewar. Right now 
there are some 45 men out for the 
squad, one of the largest turnouts 
in recent years.
Coach Bob Carman is highly 
optimistic about the coming sea­
son, and just on the basis of a 
brief look at the new material, be­
lieves they should be able to bring 
the Tri-State crown back to Tech. 
He reports that all the men are in 
excellent shape, with Gillies espe­
cially looking forward to this 
year, and a dual with Homer 
Weaver, both at Tech and at Tri- 
State. Weaver beat Gillies last 
year at Tri-State, and also edged 
out Mai in a cross country meet 
last fall.
Livingston Relays
Next Saturday, March 19, a 
group of Tech’s thinclads will 
travel to Denison College in 
Granville, Ohio, to compete in the 
Livingston Relays. Representing 
Tech in this indoor meet will be 
Mai Gillies, John Muller, Ward 
Jones, Dick Swaney, and Frank 
Smith, who will be competing 
against Baldwin-Wallace, Ohio 
State, Wayne College, Bowling
Green, Miami, and several other 
lesser known schools.
Tennis
Around the nucleus from last 
year’s team Coach Moses hopes to 
build another winning tennis 
team. Last year’s squad had an 
eight won :.nd one lost record, 
with the one loss being suffered at 
the hands of Penn State. Jim 
Miller will be completing his 
fourth year on the tennis team, 
and plans to remain the number 
one man for the coming season.
Hoping to take this distinction 
away from him will be A1 Glaser, 
John Rugheimer, Steve Rowley 
and Fran Wickham, .11 from last 
year’s squad. Missing from the 
team this year will be Don Dunck- 
lee, Maklon Saibol, and Clark 
Garrecht. Saibol and Garrecht 
graduated, but Duncklee, an archi­
tect, is still in school completing 
his fifth year and will be around

Volleyball Team 
To Start Practice
The Tech volleyball team 
which won the Eastern Intercol­
legiate Volleyball Tournament, 
at Binghamton last year, and 
placed second in the Tri-State 
Tournament, is holding its in­
itial practice Wednesday, March 
1, at 4:30 in the gym.
All who are interested are in­
vited to come down to the prac­
tice session and try out for the 
team.
Tech has managed to win the 
title three out of the four times 
that it has traveled to Bingham­
ton. The last two clubs have been 
coached by Earl Birr^y, who will 
probably take over the coaching 
reins once again, in hopes of 
keeping the title at Tech.

The post mortem of any sport 
activity usually consists of sta 
tistics, a jumbled mass of facts 
that are well-intentioned, but ar 
most improperly used.
Being no different than an; 
other school paper we presen 
the basketball statistics of t h < 
past season to delight and con 
fuse the reader. But bear in mine 
that they need some interpreta 
tion to be meaningful.
For example, Dick Fieler’s 
shooting percentage was only 
34.7, while Jim Boyd’s was 46.8; 
this doesn’t necessarily make Jim 
the better shooter, since Dick is 
an outside man while Jim does a 
lot of driving into the basket for 
layups. And yet some qualities 
that are vital for a team to func­
tion do not appear in this mass 
of data, while others are not 
quite measurable, such as the 
worth to the team, the “take- 
charge” guy, the fellow who 
comes into the game and really 
gives the team the needed lift. 
The players themselves voted 
such a title to Jimmy Boyd, the 
“most valuable player” on the 
team.
Jimmy Boyd
Jim, who hails from Browns­
ville, Pa., is a junior in the civil 
engineering department, and has 
just completed his second year 
on the varsity. Last year, his first 
on the varsity, he received hon­
orable mention for the all-distriet 
team by the Pittsburgh Press. 
This year he was second in total 
points to Fieler and second in re­
bounds to A1 Frank, but he was 
there when the chips were down. 
His all around play was good 
enough to earn him the title of 
“most valuable players,” voted to 
him by his teammates.
Thus far, next year’s schedule 
has still not been completed, with 
only 18 games listed, and six more 
to be added. The school admin­
istration is looking for some games

Refereeing Problem
While the athletic office is con­
sidering the problem -of schedul­
ing, they should also look into 
the matter of getting better ref­
erees. The exhibitions put on by 
several of these “jokers” is 
ridiculous, and does an injustice 
not only to those who are play­
ing but also to those who wish to 
watch their school team play 
without having to suffer the en- 
curbrance of a very poor grade 
of refereeing.
More than rigidly enforcing 
every regulation, the referee 
ssould have control of the game 
so that it can proceed smooth­
ly without it developing into an 
organized gang fight. This major 
duty seems to have been over­
looked by a number of the ref­
erees who have come down to the 
Tech court, as evidenced by 
games in the latter part of the 
season which were bad, in par-
ticular the Slippery Rock and 
W&J games. ,
These referees were incon­
sistent in their manner of call­
ing fouls and interpretation of the 
rules, and I am quite sure ruin­
ed the game for those playing as 
well as those who were watch­
ing. The athletic office should 
make every attempt to correct 
this situation now so that it will 
not recur during the next basket­
ball season.
All those interested in com­
ing out for the golf team 
should stop in the athletic of­
fice, get the necessary infor­
mation, and fill out the re­
quired forms. The season be­
gins April 19.

Apr. 19—W. & J.

Intramural Night 
To Feature Hooj) 
Playoff March 25
The seventh annual Intra­
mural night will be held Friday 
night. March 25. under the spon­
sorship of the Intramural Board 
and Manager’s Club, and will 
take place in the gym and Thistle 
Hall.
Intramural night with its com­
bination of fast action, awards 
and dancing has proved to be one 
of the outstanding events of the 
school year.
The program features the final 
playoff basketball game to decide 
the all school IM championships. 
In addition to this there will be 
a WAA basketball game before 
the feature game.
Immediately after the playoff 
game, which should end about 
10:00 p.m., there will be dancing 
in Thistle Hall. The highlight of 
the dance will be the presenta­
tion of trophies and awards by 
the president of the IM Board.
There's even more to 
Chevrolet styling 
than meets the eye!
This is beauty with a bonus . « . for Chevrolet 
styling is designed to add safety and comfort 
while you drive, and to return greater Value 
when you trade.
Truly modern lines are shaped by usefulness. You 
can see what we mean in the deep crystal curve of 
Chevrolet’s Sweep-Sight windshield ... a dramatic 
style note, certainly, but one that stems from the need 
for wider, safer vision. Or take high-set taillights— 
they add to the impressive length of line . . . but 
they are up where they can be seen for safety’s sake.
The smart louvers across the hood aren’t just dec­
oration . . . they mark the intake for the High-Level 
ventilation system for cleaner, fresher air. And the 
whole shape of the body—its lowness, the dipped belt 
line—is merely a reflection of a lowered center of 
gravity, the added stability.
This is truly functional styling that serves you 
better every mile, and preserves its value against the 
distant day when you trade. This is Body by Fisher 
—another Chevrolet exclusive in the low-price field. 
Come in and let us demonstrate that this new Chev­
rolet is just as exciting to drive as to look at!

According to psychiatrists, peo­
ple who have a habit of talking 
to themselves should always 
speak clearly. A mumbled mes­
sage, or one you don’t quite catch, 
may cause a split personality. Try 
to start the day off with a cheer­
ful greeting such as “Hello, hand­
some!” When you ask yourself a 
question, answer promptly. This 
will avoid an anxiety complex. 
Only a lazy person would tell 
.himself a joke and then merely 
thing of the punch line. If it is 
a truly funny story, do not be 
afraid to laugh, no matter where 
you are.
There may be days when you 
will not feel like talking to your­
self. When this happens, go out 
among crowds, visit friends, at­
tend cocketail parties. Observe 
how others talk, the way they 
shape their lips and the gestures 
they use.
Within a 6hort time, you should 
be talking to yourself again. But 
keep it brief.

Father Cheetham; 
Lectures Continue
The second of the Lenten series 
lectures sponsored by the Even­
ing School Newman Club was held 
on Sunday, March 6. The lecture 
and discussion on courtship and 
morality was conducted by Father 
William G. Cheetham. The proper 
age for courtship, length of court­
ship, morality during courtship, 
and the values of courtship were 
discussed. Father Regis Berkmyre, 
chaplain of the group, was present 
along with a large group who en­
joyed the session. Among the 
many new faces present was a new
exchange student, Ewald Gondoli.
Again, we wish to tell you that 
these sessions are open to all who 
wish to attend. It is not necessary 
to be a member of the Newman 
Club to attend. The lectures are 
held each Sunday evening during 
Lent at the Carnegie Union, start­
ing promptly at 7:30 p.m.

A Campus-to-Career Case History
He figures for the future
It’s James Kirchhoff’s job to look 
ahead. As a Plant Engineer with 
Illinois Bell Telephone Company, he 
helps estimate telephone equipment 
needs years in advance.
For example ... when a new real 
estate development is in the planning 
stage, Jim figures how much tele­
phone equipment it will need when 
it reaches its full growth. His esti­
mate is based on his knowledge of
the equipment’s potential plus fore­
casts provided him of the area’s rate 
of development. He then makes a 
complete report that becomes the 
basis of plans for the future.
Jim can take a look at his own 
future, too. In telephone engineering 
he can see a great many opportunities 
opening up in the next five years ... 
ten years. He can pick the one he 
wants and start working toward it.
Jim graduated from Northwestern University 
as an E.E., class of 1952. His progress since 
then is typical of college men who have chosen 
telephone careers. If you’d be interested in a 
similar opportunity, see your Placement Of­
ficer for full details. There are also openings 
with other Bell telephone companies, with Bell 
Telephone Laboratories, or Western Electric 
and the Sandia Corporation.

' Surprising Results
Using a four-terminal cell and 
an a-c potentiometer circuit to 
measure liquid conductivity, the 
Carnegie Tech professors exam­
ined the electrical character of 
many melts. When they came to a 
test of molten copper sulphide 
(Cu2S) they found the conduc­
tivity was more than tenfold of 
that expected in ordinary ionic 
conduction. When they passed di­
rect current through the liquid, 
they noted virtually no transfer 
of mass, indicating no appreciable 
ionic contrabution to the conduc­
tance. Checking further, they 
found the molten copper sulphide 
displayed a positive temperature 
coefficient, conductivity increas­
ing with temperature rise as it 
does in semiconductors.
“We concluded,” Dr. Derge
Two Tech Researchers 
Find Metals Property
Through the ages, extractive metallurgy has grown from a crude 
to a refined art, but to this day it remains art, not science.
Today’s smelting processes are basically the same as those used 
in biblical times. The scientific approach makes itself quite evident 
in the petroleum, chemical and^ 
electronic industries where a vari­
ety of new processes and pro­
ducts are uncovered every year. 
But metallurgical progress has 
not been so rapid because of lim­
itations. imposed by high temper­
ature reactions. The metallurgist 
today does not always know if he 
is operating under optimum condi­
tions when he extracts metal 
from ore.
A recent discovery at Carnegie 
Tech Metals Research Laboratory 
provides new basic information 
for those processes. Studying the 
electrical properties of high tem­
perature melts on an Atomic En­
ergy Commission project, two 
Carnegie Tech metallurgists dis­
covered a liquid that behaves 
electrically like a solid semicon­
ductor.
The best known example of 
semiconduction in a solid is the 
transistor which conducts elec­
tronically rather than ionically as 
in the case of ordinary salts, 
either molten or in aqueous solu­
tion. Exploring less familiar 
liquids such as those used in 
metallurgical processes, Drs. Ger­
hard Derge and G. M. Pound un­
covered new information about 
the structure of these melts.
states, “that we were, in effect, 
observing a form of semiconduc­
tion. The magnitude of conduction 
is so great that it cannot be ex­
plained by an ionic mechanism 
and it has a positive temperature 
coefficient. Molten iron sulphide 
(FeS) was also tested and found 
to conduct even better than the 
copper compound by a factor of 
ten, but the iron sulphide has a 
negative coefficient, similar to 
metals. The conductivities of 
mattes made by mixing these 
together approach the rule of 
mixtures behavior.”
New Theory Needed 
Existing theories on the nature 
of semiconduction cannot account 
for the new discovery since they 
apply exclusively to solids such 
as the transistor and not to 
liquids where the atoms are in a 
state of disorder. But though these 
mattes have the property of semi­
conduction, both Drs. Pound and 
Derge affirm they are molten
liquids and must not be expected 
to perform functions of a tran­
sistor in electronic applications.
Instead, they hope their new 
discovery will provide a new tool 
for probing the persistent mys­
teries of liquid structure and per­
haps be used as a cornerstone for 
a new scientific basis upon which 
the field of metallurgy can grow.
“The objective of our program,” 
the Carnegie Tech metallurgists 
stressed in a joint statement, “is 
to learn more about the chemical 
and structural makeup of fused 
materials. This will lead to a bet­
ter understanding of smelting 
and refining processes in metal­
lurgy and perhaps new or im­
proved processes. It will also con­
tribute to other technologies 
where such melts are important, 
such as ceramics and heat trans­
fer applications. The research will 
continue in this direction. We 
have no desire to develop mater­
ials for their special electrical 
properties alone.”
